00:06:23.026 --> 00:06:29.275
Today we have gathered here to do
Guru puja.

00:06:30.962 --> 00:06:34.237
This system started long time back
in India,

00:06:34.438 --> 00:06:39.420
I think even at the time of Patanjali,

00:06:39.621 --> 00:06:45.904
maybe even earlier, when there were
great seekers.

00:06:46.105 --> 00:06:52.500
And their gurus were sitting
in the jungles, where they used to get

00:06:54.034 --> 00:06:58.928
permission to go there and then
they would get their realisation,

00:06:59.129 --> 00:07:02.000
very few of them, one or two.

00:07:02.201 --> 00:07:08.641
So we had many rishis and munis
in the olden times in India.

00:07:08.842 --> 00:07:12.642
So this system of guru started.

00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:21.209
Also one of the reasons is that, that there
is no organised religion in India.

00:07:21.410 --> 00:07:27.567
There’s no popes, there are no priests,
nothing like them.

00:07:27.768 --> 00:07:31.754
They have priests just for worshipping
in the temples.

00:07:31.955 --> 00:07:38.932
But for giving realisation, for talking
about higher life,

00:07:39.133 --> 00:07:47.155
they all had to go to very great
realised souls.

00:07:48.797 --> 00:07:55.136
And it was absolutely the freedom of the
guru, whom to accept whom not to accept.

00:07:55.337 --> 00:08:00.719
And everybody was tested thoroughly
by the guru

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:08.133
if they are capable of achieving
Self-realisation or not.

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:15.547
And this test was so hard, so difficult,

00:08:15.748 --> 00:08:24.030
and also to a point of cruelty, that very
few could pass through that test.

00:08:24.231 --> 00:08:29.118
It’s not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is
a Sahaja Yogi, it’s not like that.

00:08:30.542 --> 00:08:37.723
That, of course, made it a very narrow
margin for people

00:08:37.924 --> 00:08:43.966
to achieve their realisation and these
gurus never used to leave

00:08:44.167 --> 00:08:47.724
their own seats, they call it takiya
(meaning: pillow).

00:08:47.925 --> 00:08:51.778
They would be there in their own place,
all those who would like to go to him

00:08:51.979 --> 00:08:59.044
could come. If he allowed, then only
they can meet him.

00:08:59.245 --> 00:09:02.164
You may go on for miles together, nothing,

00:09:02.365 --> 00:09:06.653
no obligations of the guru that he should
meet you.

00:09:10.942 --> 00:09:20.115
Perhaps they didn’t feel that love and
compassion for the seekers.

00:09:20.316 --> 00:09:26.932
They didn’t understand that these seekers
are ardently seeking the truth

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:30.180
and they should not suffer.

00:09:30.644 --> 00:09:37.007
That may be the reason they were not
so much concerned.

00:09:37.208 --> 00:09:40.963
All the time they were testing
their disciple.

00:09:41.164 --> 00:09:45.109
Even Ramdas, who was the guru of Shivaji,

00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:49.690
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,

00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:52.943
though he was a born realised.

00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:59.436
So to get this Gurupada, to [the] position
of a guru,

00:09:59.637 --> 00:10:09.421
after that they had to work very, very hard
to achieve a state of a saint.

00:10:11.983 --> 00:10:16.745
But in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case,
as you know.

00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.317
I just thought – if people get their
realisation,

00:10:21.518 --> 00:10:24.675
they’ll see for themselves what’s wrong
with them,

00:10:24.876 --> 00:10:30.577
they will introspect themselves and will
try to correct themselves.

00:10:30.778 --> 00:10:38.168
It is true, for many, many people, but some
of them still are lingering behind

00:10:38.369 --> 00:10:42.557
and are going on and on and on thinking
that they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:42.758 --> 00:10:48.589
they have achieved a lot, they are
something very special.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:53.587
So this delusion is all the time
is creating this problem.

00:10:53.788 --> 00:11:01.143
This delusion makes them very
narrow minded,

00:11:01.344 --> 00:11:09.784
selfish, self-centred, and people can’t
believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis.

00:11:12.502 --> 00:11:15.336
So the first and foremost thing we have
to know

00:11:15.537 --> 00:11:21.630
that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out
because Paramchaitanya

00:11:21.831 --> 00:11:26.495
is transmitting compassion. It never
did before.

00:11:26.696 --> 00:11:35.163
It never had that kind of an attitude
which it is there because I am a Mother.

00:11:35.364 --> 00:11:40.649
And this compassion has worked it this way
that: you all have got your realisation,

00:11:40.881 --> 00:11:46.362
you have achieved a state which we can
call as a Self-realised souls.

00:11:46.563 --> 00:11:53.698
But still, because you got it so easily,
cheaply,

00:11:53.899 --> 00:11:59.145
I think, still we don’t realise what we
have got.

00:11:59.346 --> 00:12:09.578
Still we do not practice meditation,
introspection and dedication.

00:12:09.779 --> 00:12:13.106
Some are very much there,

00:12:13.307 --> 00:12:20.202
but mostly we are just living in the idea
that we have already achieved.

00:12:22.846 --> 00:12:27.240
So, the first thing we should introspect:

00:12:28.971 --> 00:12:33.555
Are we concerned about ourselves?

00:12:35.472 --> 00:12:39.191
All the time do we think that we are
suffering,

00:12:39.392 --> 00:12:42.925
we have this problem, that problem,

00:12:43.126 --> 00:12:46.851
or this should be done, that should
be done.

00:12:47.052 --> 00:12:54.356
If the attention is on that, that all
the time you are worried about yourself,

00:12:56.094 --> 00:13:03.766
then you cannot break, you cannot break
through this shell of your being,

00:13:03.967 --> 00:13:13.478
which is under the domination of your
mental selfishness or self-centredness.

00:13:13.679 --> 00:13:19.761
Even self-centredness is absolutely
against your growth.

00:13:19.962 --> 00:13:23.238
There are many people who come,
I have seen, even to Cabella,

00:13:23.439 --> 00:13:27.093
I know they have to suffer a lot because
they think

00:13:27.294 --> 00:13:30.927
it’s a very open space where they have
to live

00:13:31.128 --> 00:13:34.844
and they must make all arrangements
to make themselves comfortable.

00:13:35.045 --> 00:13:37.805
Such people have to grow still much more.

00:13:38.006 --> 00:13:43.231
For a saint, any place has to be heavenly.

00:13:43.432 --> 00:13:48.467
You must have seen Me enjoying everything.

00:13:48.668 --> 00:13:54.726
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere.
I have no demands of any kind.

00:13:54.927 --> 00:14:02.839
But if you are worried about your body
comforts or your body troubles

00:14:03.040 --> 00:14:09.102
then still you are at a body level, which
you have to transcend.

00:14:09.303 --> 00:14:14.499
Worried about how you look, how you
dress up,

00:14:14.700 --> 00:14:19.355
what sort of things you have to wear:

00:14:19.835 --> 00:14:26.839
all this makes you yet not a good
Sahaja Yogi.

00:14:29.942 --> 00:14:37.749
This is one style of Sahaja Yogis who
still want very great comforts.

00:14:37.950 --> 00:14:43.334
So, what you have to do, if you are used
to comforts:

00:14:43.535 --> 00:14:47.613
try to go and sleep on the street.

00:14:48.015 --> 00:14:54.127
I will not do that, but you can do it.
Or sleep on a tree.

00:14:54.328 --> 00:14:57.826
You may fall down, doesn’t matter.

00:15:03.681 --> 00:15:08.008
Do all kinds of things that are necessary
to punish your body to understand

00:15:08.209 --> 00:15:13.234
that you are not bound with this comfort
of the body.

00:15:15.482 --> 00:15:19.225
This is one of the greatest things one
has to see,

00:15:19.426 --> 00:15:23.288
that you are not bound by your body.

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:27.945
It’s alright - if you have comfort, well
and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

00:15:28.146 --> 00:15:35.313
For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important that
he should be able to live like a saint.

00:15:35.514 --> 00:15:39.660
Not necessarily that you should become
a sanyasi,

00:15:39.836 --> 00:15:48.656
but from inside your body should be such
that you can dominate your body.

00:15:48.857 --> 00:15:55.196
How can you not sleep anywhere?
Why can you not sleep anywhere?

00:15:56.713 --> 00:16:05.631
Then also, that they want to have a very
comfortable arrangements

00:16:05.832 --> 00:16:09.776
about bathrooms, this, that.

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:15.853
All these ideas are there because you are
very self-conscious

00:16:16.054 --> 00:16:20.126
but not superconsciousness, it’s not there.

00:16:20.327 --> 00:16:22.983
You want to have everything first class,

00:16:23.184 --> 00:16:29.263
and anybody who tries to interfere with
that kind of a thing, you don’t like it.

00:16:29.464 --> 00:16:34.209
I can understand a person who is very old –
he cannot manage things,

00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:40.343
he has to have a certain amount
of body comfort,

00:16:40.544 --> 00:16:47.269
but even young people these days are
extremely comfort-oriented.

00:16:48.724 --> 00:16:51.802
That is not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:53.593 --> 00:16:58.882
Of course, I’ve seen people in the West
are better off in this matter.

00:16:59.083 --> 00:17:02.366
Because when they go to India they told Me
they like

00:17:02.567 --> 00:17:06.701
[Maharashtra] S.T. buses better than
comfortable buses.

00:17:06.902 --> 00:17:08.353
So I said, “Why?”

00:17:08.554 --> 00:17:13.466
“Because Mother, you can jump in the bus
nicely with all the luggage,”

00:17:13.667 --> 00:17:19.990
“Because the windows are open, you can
breathe. Very natural, very good”.

00:17:20.192 --> 00:17:25.398
And they wanted to go on bullock carts
also. I mean they enjoy all that.

00:17:25.599 --> 00:17:30.275
Actually if you see you'll notice,
in the Western World mostly,

00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:33.194
people are taking to [a] more rustic life.

00:17:33.395 --> 00:17:36.370
They are enjoying more the rustic style
of life

00:17:36.571 --> 00:17:40.119
than to this so-called comfortable,
artificial life.

00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:46.614
Not so much Indians, I would say,
also Malaysians.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:54.204
I think, most of the people I have met
in the Western countries are really great

00:17:54.405 --> 00:17:59.143
because they can sleep anywhere,
they can eat anything.

00:17:59.344 --> 00:18:05.229
You ask them, “How did you like the food?”
“What did we eat, I don’t know Mother?”

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:10.066
That is the sign. That is the sign
of a person

00:18:10.267 --> 00:18:16.233
who is not bothered as to what he
is eating, what he’s getting,

00:18:16.434 --> 00:18:24.894
what is his taste, “I like this, I like
that,” these words drop out.

00:18:25.974 --> 00:18:29.671
It’s not difficult, it’s not difficult,

00:18:29.872 --> 00:18:34.212
you might think that I am asking you to do
something, hazardous thing, you see.

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:39.029
It’s not difficult at all. Because if you
have to impress

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:43.594
the people around, you have to be
like a saint.

00:18:43.795 --> 00:18:48.668
And if you are a fussy person, if you are
a fusspot,

00:18:48.869 --> 00:18:55.371
then you cannot impress others that you
have got Self-realisation.

00:18:55.572 --> 00:18:58.558
Many people tell Me, “Mother, people
had to do so much:

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:03.966
to go to Himalayas, do this, do that,
and then they got their realisation.

00:19:04.167 --> 00:19:09.718
How is it these people you have blessed?”
Even some great saints asked Me that.

00:19:09.919 --> 00:19:13.375
“What right they had to get this
realisation?

00:19:13.576 --> 00:19:17.178
Why did you give them realisation?
What have they achieved?”

00:19:17.379 --> 00:19:19.754
I said, “Only their desire.

00:19:19.955 --> 00:19:24.024
Their desire was very much there that
they should get their Self-realisation

00:19:24.225 --> 00:19:27.394
and that’s how they got it”.

00:19:27.661 --> 00:19:35.968
But now to go into only desire,
is not sufficient.

00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:39.221
You have to depend on your Self,

00:19:39.422 --> 00:19:43.653
on the light of your Spirit you should see
what’s wrong with you.

00:19:43.854 --> 00:19:48.578
This is a very important thing.
Ask questions to yourself.

00:19:48.779 --> 00:19:54.783
“Why do I want this? Why do I need this?
What is the purpose?”

00:19:54.984 --> 00:19:59.163
Because as you have seen, all the rest
of the world is mad,

00:19:59.364 --> 00:20:06.652
[we] call it mad, because they are
running after stupid things,

00:20:06.853 --> 00:20:12.659
they are wanting things which
has no meaning to spirituality.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:17.560
So spirituality itself should be
self-satisfying.

00:20:17.761 --> 00:20:22.087
If you are spiritually endowed, then you
are self-satisfied.

00:20:22.288 --> 00:20:28.393
And this self-satisfaction within you
will lead you

00:20:28.593 --> 00:20:33.155
to that Ocean of Joy about which
I have been telling you

00:20:33.356 --> 00:20:37.707
and all the Scriptures have described.

00:20:38.638 --> 00:20:44.733
For Sahaja Yogis, the word we use
is Nirananda.

00:20:44.934 --> 00:20:52.579
Nirananda means: A joyous state, where
nothing is needed.

00:20:52.984 --> 00:20:58.012
Joy itself is joy. You are enjoying
only joy.

00:20:58.213 --> 00:21:01.294
Nothing is needed to make you happy.

00:21:01.495 --> 00:21:09.089
You are happy because of joy that you have,
in the Nirananda state.

00:21:09.664 --> 00:21:16.158
If you go and see how these saints lived,
you will be amazed.

00:21:16.359 --> 00:21:21.544
How they managed their life, you’ll be
very much amazed.

00:21:21.745 --> 00:21:24.874
How many days they used to fast,
without food.

00:21:25.075 --> 00:21:27.448
Never bothered! They never thought
it was fasting.

00:21:27.649 --> 00:21:32.050
They just used to think, “We have no food,
so no, don’t eat.”

00:21:32.669 --> 00:21:36.982
Of course, you don’t have to go through
[that], you have got your realisation.

00:21:37.183 --> 00:21:42.290
So now you have a power to achieve
this mastery.

00:21:42.491 --> 00:21:45.119
Now you have this power.

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.966
The another thing I have noticed
about Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:50.167 --> 00:21:55.830
some of them have grudges about others.

00:21:56.091 --> 00:22:00.048
Sahaja Yoga is

00:22:02.303 --> 00:22:11.354
the blessings of love, blessings
of compassion.

00:22:11.877 --> 00:22:16.902
There is no place for any kind of hatred,

00:22:17.103 --> 00:22:25.408
or any kind of revenge, or anger
among Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:26.734 --> 00:22:30.489
If you have that, you must conquer it.

00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:37.740
Is a good chance, if you find somebody
who is very hot-tempered,

00:22:38.111 --> 00:22:44.215
who is a very angry type, go and make
friends with that person.

00:22:44.416 --> 00:22:48.193
Just see if you can carry on with that
person or not.

00:22:48.394 --> 00:22:53.163
If there’s a fusspot, also make friends
with such a fusspot,

00:22:53.364 --> 00:23:00.555
and see that you achieve that peace

00:23:00.756 --> 00:23:04.555
which will keep you above all kinds
of hatred,

00:23:04.756 --> 00:23:09.437
all kinds of temper, which is a very
bad thing.

00:23:09.638 --> 00:23:12.838
But some Sahaja Yogis lose their temper
very fast.

00:23:13.039 --> 00:23:15.686
I would say they cannot be Sahaja Yogis,

00:23:15.887 --> 00:23:20.814
because if you have no control over
your anger,

00:23:21.015 --> 00:23:26.670
then how are you powerful of compassion
and love?

00:23:26.871 --> 00:23:31.352
But you don’t even have to control it –
just there.

00:23:31.553 --> 00:23:36.954
Once you have it, you have that state,
then you just watch and see.

00:23:37.293 --> 00:23:45.649
In the olden days, the saints, mostly, used
to be very much angry type people.

00:23:45.850 --> 00:23:49.443
They couldn’t bear the stupidity
of the world

00:23:49.644 --> 00:23:55.574
and they used to be very, very angry type
and they used to run away from people.

00:23:55.775 --> 00:24:02.136
I know of a saint, Nityanandswami, who
always lived on the tree,

00:24:02.337 --> 00:24:06.133
and anybody tried to come near him,
he used to throw stones at him.

00:24:06.334 --> 00:24:13.442
Couldn’t bear people who were all
heated up and coming to him.

00:24:13.643 --> 00:24:18.737
But you don’t need that. You have a way
of achieving

00:24:18.938 --> 00:24:25.786
love and affection of the people who seem
to be very, very troublesome

00:24:25.987 --> 00:24:30.985
and grudging type or maybe some people
who are very aggressive.

00:24:31.186 --> 00:24:36.747
This is not a difficult task if you try
a little bit the other way round.

00:24:36.964 --> 00:24:41.506
Mostly people, when they find somebody
who is a very hot-tempered person,

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:46.182
they run away from them. «We don’t want
to have anything to do [with them]».

00:24:46.383 --> 00:24:55.037
Those who are not hot-tempered, those
who are good natured,

00:24:55.258 --> 00:24:59.728
you can always be friendly, what is
so great about it?

00:25:00.813 --> 00:25:11.085
What is so nice about it?
What is so sweet about it?

00:25:12.154 --> 00:25:17.339
But how you speak to the person, how you
talk to that person,

00:25:17.539 --> 00:25:25.109
how you manage that person: your love
will definitely melt him down,

00:25:25.310 --> 00:25:29.829
because he’s a Sahaja Yogi, I’m not saying
for non-sahaja yogis.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:35.831
Sahaja Yogis as they are, you have
to be extremely

00:25:36.032 --> 00:25:40.926
compassionate and affectionate
and love.

00:25:44.039 --> 00:25:49.311
The another thing which is extremely
important for us to know,

00:25:49.512 --> 00:25:54.927
that we have got this realisation
through Mother’s love.

00:25:55.128 --> 00:25:57.815
Only My compassion has acted,

00:25:58.016 --> 00:26:02.238
only the power of Mother’s compassion
could have worked it out.

00:26:02.439 --> 00:26:08.438
Now, even if this love is flowing towards
the stones,

00:26:08.639 --> 00:26:15.582
or towards the mountains, or towards
anything which is very solid,

00:26:15.783 --> 00:26:20.796
the ripples come back, they have
to come back.

00:26:20.997 --> 00:26:24.906
In the same way, you people now,
who have got realisation,

00:26:25.107 --> 00:26:28.437
have to know that compassion and love

00:26:28.638 --> 00:26:33.112
is the only power you have got,
nothing else.

00:26:34.447 --> 00:26:39.428
If you love yourself, you care
for yourself,

00:26:39.629 --> 00:26:44.050
you care for your family and care
for your children –

00:26:44.251 --> 00:26:47.687
then you haven’t achieved much.

00:26:47.888 --> 00:26:51.282
You are only worried about yourself,

00:26:51.483 --> 00:26:55.872
because that’s your limited area
where you move.

00:26:56.073 --> 00:27:04.361
But if you can break that and find out
places

00:27:04.562 --> 00:27:10.513
where you have to express your love,
you can.

00:27:10.714 --> 00:27:13.796
As they say, the water finds it’s own
level.

00:27:13.997 --> 00:27:19.338
In the same way, this compassion has
to flow to all the places,

00:27:19.539 --> 00:27:24.975
to all the ditches everywhere,
and should find its own level.

00:27:25.176 --> 00:27:31.969
But if you are just satisfied with yourself
and you are not bothered,

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:40.990
you are just trying to believe that you are
a great soul because you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:27:41.191 --> 00:27:46.118
then I must say that you are sadly
mistaken.

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:50.510
In this lifetime you can achieve
that state.

00:27:50.711 --> 00:27:58.930
In this lifetime you can get to that state
within yourself.

00:27:59.131 --> 00:28:02.637
Now, the third thing that troubles
Sahaja Yogis is that

00:28:02.838 --> 00:28:08.322
“Mother, we want God’s realisation,”
that makes Me laugh.

00:28:08.523 --> 00:28:14.743
You see, it is already there, already
there.

00:28:14.944 --> 00:28:17.351
Like once you get into the sea

00:28:17.552 --> 00:28:19.846
and you say, “Mother, we want to go
to the bottom of the sea,”

00:28:20.047 --> 00:28:24.769
you can always go, just slip,
and you will be there.

00:28:24.970 --> 00:28:32.835
In the same way, once you have developed
a kind of a Self-realisation

00:28:33.036 --> 00:28:37.910
and have jumped into the Ocean
of this compassion,

00:28:38.111 --> 00:28:41.039
there’s no need to achieve anything.

00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.826
The sense of achievement, “I should be
that, I should be this,”

00:28:45.027 --> 00:28:49.484
is all coming from your human haunting.

00:28:49.685 --> 00:28:52.814
That should be over. Now you are
Godly people.

00:28:53.015 --> 00:28:57.524
So you should not think, “I should achieve
this state, I should achieve that state,”

00:28:57.725 --> 00:29:03.368
but just go on slipping, just giving up all
the weights that you have in your heads

00:29:03.576 --> 00:29:09.866
and it will work out. This is what I have
been saying to you that:

00:29:10.327 --> 00:29:17.234
you have to dissolve yourself
into the compassion.

00:29:17.459 --> 00:29:24.526
Also, there are still some very people
who want to be in the front.

00:29:24.883 --> 00:29:30.252
Specially Indians will all sit together
in front, I’ve seen that way.

00:29:30.453 --> 00:29:36.327
They have no right, they have no right
to sit in front.

00:29:36.528 --> 00:29:42.925
Nobody has right to sit in front or to seek
a place.

00:29:43.126 --> 00:29:51.047
They should sit wherever they get seat
to sit down with complete satisfaction.

00:29:51.912 --> 00:29:55.809
Whether you sit in front or at that corner,
even in the darkness,

00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:01.503
you can get My vibrations, you can get
everything.

00:30:01.704 --> 00:30:09.631
So to be prominent, to sit some place where
you are prominent, is not necessary.

00:30:11.052 --> 00:30:14.778
What is it in a prominence, what do
you get?

00:30:14.986 --> 00:30:23.850
To be lost into the crowds, to be lost
into the Ocean of Love is the main thing.

00:30:25.099 --> 00:30:31.827
All these are mythical that, we should
somehow or other get the front place.

00:30:32.027 --> 00:30:38.178
You see as Marathi apan manto (We say),
“Samor chi zaaga patkauli mi!”

00:30:42.921 --> 00:30:47.453
means “I have managed to get the front
seat!”

00:30:47.654 --> 00:30:54.023
Front will be the back, and back will be
the front.

00:30:54.319 --> 00:31:00.209
It is very surprising how still people
are trying

00:31:00.427 --> 00:31:04.968
to achieve something so nonsensical.

00:31:05.261 --> 00:31:10.638
So where is your mind, where is your
attention, what are you thinking?

00:31:10.839 --> 00:31:16.266
If you are thoughtless you'll be satisfied,
you'll be happy,

00:31:16.467 --> 00:31:21.379
you'll not ask for anything, you’ll not
want anything.

00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:27.063
What is there to have? What is
so important?

00:31:28.570 --> 00:31:32.726
All these ideas come from ignorance, I must
tell you, is from ignorance.

00:31:32.927 --> 00:31:36.463
Once this ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ fellow
came to Me.

00:31:36.663 --> 00:31:41.239
And he said that, “We have heard you
are a great saint,

00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.350
this thing, that thing, and you have
all the comforts of life –

00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:49.913
you have everything here, very nice,
this thing, that thing.

00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:55.453
So, how are you a saint?”
I said, “How are you a saint?”

00:31:55.654 --> 00:32:01.958
[He said,] “I have given up my family,
I have given up my cars,

00:32:02.166 --> 00:32:08.184
I have given up my house, I have given up
my children.”

00:32:08.812 --> 00:32:13.857
I said, “One more thing you have given up”,
he said, “What?” “Your brains!”

00:32:23.093 --> 00:32:25.585
So they said, “But how do you say we have
given up our brains?”

00:32:25.786 --> 00:32:32.470
I said, “Very simple, I’ve given up
nothing, because I am holding nothing.

00:32:32.671 --> 00:32:36.577
What is there to give up when you are
not holding anything?

00:32:36.778 --> 00:32:42.199
Now, I would say in this house,
or on my body, anywhere,

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.182
[if] you think you can find anything equal
to the dust particle

00:32:47.383 --> 00:32:55.838
of Shri Krishna, you can take it.
Should be equal though.”

00:32:56.039 --> 00:32:59.126
Now they started looking here and there.

00:32:59.327 --> 00:33:05.235
I said, “Then what have you given up?
Just stones! What have you given up?

00:33:05.436 --> 00:33:09.227
Why are you boasting about giving up that,
and giving up this and giving up…?”

00:33:09.428 --> 00:33:13.960
They even shaved their head. What is it?

00:33:14.161 --> 00:33:20.049
All these useless ideas that, “We have done
this, we have done that.”

00:33:20.254 --> 00:33:23.520
Anybody in Sahaja Yoga who thinks he
is doing a lot of work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:23.721 --> 00:33:27.397
should give up completely.

00:33:28.995 --> 00:33:32.240
That’s the sign of another ignorance.

00:33:32.441 --> 00:33:36.296
If you are part and parcel of the Ocean,

00:33:36.497 --> 00:33:39.868
everything is done by Ocean, you are
doing nothing.

00:33:40.069 --> 00:33:48.148
To have such ideas about yourself shows
how little you know about yourself.

00:33:48.349 --> 00:33:53.284
You are the Ocean. Now, if you are
the Ocean how can you claim,

00:33:53.485 --> 00:33:57.792
“I have touched this shore, I have touched
that shore, I have touched this shore”?

00:33:57.993 --> 00:34:03.001
No more “I” is left. Once this I-ness
drops out,

00:34:03.202 --> 00:34:09.218
then only the Universal Being within you
shines.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:21.273
All these things are so clearly evident
in our characters.

00:34:21.455 --> 00:34:27.741
Some people are very identified, say
with their country,

00:34:27.942 --> 00:34:34.030
or maybe with their worshipping style,
whatever it is.

00:34:34.231 --> 00:34:38.954
All these misidentifications have to be
given up.

00:34:39.155 --> 00:34:42.666
It’s very difficult for people because
they are so conditioned.

00:34:42.867 --> 00:34:48.878
And as long as you have conditioning
you cannot rise above your mind,

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:52.754
which is a myth, you cannot.

00:34:52.970 --> 00:34:57.975
Now, try to understand what are
your conditionings are.

00:35:02.347 --> 00:35:06.463
One of them, I would say, I have seen
and I am so surprised,

00:35:06.664 --> 00:35:13.753
you go to the Western countries, all
of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha.

00:35:13.954 --> 00:35:15.986
They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha,

00:35:16.187 --> 00:35:21.708
Shri Ganesha’s photographs, Shri Ganesha’s
everything, children also.

00:35:21.945 --> 00:35:24.693
And now I have seen that vibrations stop!

00:35:24.894 --> 00:35:28.640
Why should they stop? Why should Ganesha
stop the vibrations?

00:35:28.841 --> 00:35:31.680
Why they are doing it, I realised, was
because I said

00:35:31.881 --> 00:35:35.162
Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ.

00:35:35.386 --> 00:35:41.900
Their identification is with Christ and
Christianity, in a very subtle way.

00:35:44.611 --> 00:35:50.937
So all the vibrations stopped! Imagine
with Shri Ganesha’s music, we heard

00:35:51.138 --> 00:35:57.024
in one of the Eastern Block countries,
and all the vibrations had stopped

00:35:57.225 --> 00:36:00.711
and they were singing all the songs,
all the songs of Shri Ganesha,

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:10.605
not one song of Sahaja Yoga, leave alone
about the Guru, not one song.

00:36:11.287 --> 00:36:17.778
So, even this, there is a very subtle,
subtle identification.

00:36:17.979 --> 00:36:27.124
There was one fellow in Russia, supposed
to be very intelligent,

00:36:27.325 --> 00:36:31.648
he said that, “Alright, if we keep Mother’s
photograph and also the icons,

00:36:31.849 --> 00:36:37.362
we can get the same type of vibrations.”
You cannot,

00:36:37.893 --> 00:36:42.635
because icons are made by some artist’s
imaginary.

00:36:42.836 --> 00:36:45.327
These are not representing actually

00:36:45.528 --> 00:36:50.183
even Maria or Christ or anyone, they are
all, all imaginary.

00:36:50.384 --> 00:36:56.108
If Italian ones makes Christ, he is
Italian style,

00:36:56.309 --> 00:37:01.814
if somebody - French one makes, he is
thin like [a] Frenchman,

00:37:02.031 --> 00:37:10.372
if you get somebody, say from Holland,
he'll have a forehead like that.

00:37:11.067 --> 00:37:17.712
You see all of them, they depict Christ
as they want to.

00:37:17.952 --> 00:37:25.454
Then we have Maria the same way.
Her expression, her photograph, everything,

00:37:25.662 --> 00:37:29.624
is all according to the imagination
of the artist

00:37:29.825 --> 00:37:35.073
and to whatever country he belongs,
that he will do.

00:37:35.274 --> 00:37:38.423
And they are not free, you can see,
they are not free,

00:37:38.624 --> 00:37:42.927
because all these artists have a certain
style.

00:37:43.128 --> 00:37:46.533
Now if it is Rembrandt, it’s a style,

00:37:46.734 --> 00:37:50.739
if it is, say Leonardo, it’s a style.

00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:54.969
Though they are born realised, still
they have a style. Nobody is like this,

00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:00.087
that he’ll make today like this, tomorrow
like this: there’s no freedom.

00:38:00.428 --> 00:38:04.551
They are bound by their own styles.

00:38:05.646 --> 00:38:10.960
Everybody has one style, and that is
the style they follow.

00:38:11.161 --> 00:38:18.403
Because, what is the reason? Reason is,
they must have done 3, 4 types of styles,

00:38:18.603 --> 00:38:23.723
must have done, sure, but people must
have rejected,

00:38:23.930 --> 00:38:29.779
“This is no good, this is no good.” So
it's all, you see, opinion of the people.

00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:33.651
So they must have taken to one style:
alright, this is the style.

00:38:33.852 --> 00:38:40.488
So you can see Christ if he’s Japanese,
he’ll have chinky eyes,

00:38:42.194 --> 00:38:46.367
if he’s Chinese, he’ll have no nose,

00:38:47.248 --> 00:38:53.621
if it’s Indian, he’ll be dark. So all kinds
of Christs I have seen

00:38:53.822 --> 00:39:00.103
and I feel that, how can they emit
vibrations? Tell Me.

00:39:01.468 --> 00:39:04.207
While with My photograph, how can you
compare?

00:39:04.408 --> 00:39:10.167
Also, cameras were to be developed at this
time: do you notice that point?

00:39:10.368 --> 00:39:15.424
Cameras were developed at this time,
not before that.

00:39:15.624 --> 00:39:20.343
This loudspeaker was not developed
before this.

00:39:20.544 --> 00:39:25.904
Aeroplanes were not developed before.
I have been travelling for 19 days,

00:39:26.105 --> 00:39:30.712
one day in the plane, second day
in the public programme.

00:39:30.913 --> 00:39:36.174
They could not do all that. Nobody could
do this.

00:39:36.374 --> 00:39:39.439
Neither Shri Krishna, nor anyone.

00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:44.480
They could not fly by aeroplane
in those days.

00:39:44.681 --> 00:39:48.797
Now we say we have 65 countries, somebody
says there’s “No, 68 countries”

00:39:48.998 --> 00:39:54.679
or go on correcting. But is only possible
because today, today:

00:39:54.880 --> 00:39:59.433
there are aeroplanes. They were never
there [before].

00:39:59.634 --> 00:40:06.419
So all these things are – even video, even
the way you are seeing My image there,

00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:10.590
was that available before? No.

00:40:12.291 --> 00:40:19.083
So this is a very special time, where
science has also supported

00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:22.719
seekers to find the Truth – science
has supported.

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:25.877
We have to be thankful to science:

00:40:26.046 --> 00:40:30.613
that part of science which has been
so much supportive.

00:40:30.826 --> 00:40:36.434
Even [if] there was not a car, I could not
have gone up to Milan even!

00:40:36.855 --> 00:40:41.432
Imagine going on a bullock cart, what would
have happened to Me?

00:40:42.952 --> 00:40:48.495
So all these things are created today
for you.

00:40:48.696 --> 00:40:54.881
You were also born in those times
for this special reason.

00:40:55.082 --> 00:41:01.772
They could not give realisation because
that time you were not there.

00:41:02.457 --> 00:41:05.280
Very few people of your calibre were there.

00:41:05.481 --> 00:41:08.241
But I wonder if you understand
your calibre.

00:41:08.442 --> 00:41:14.659
The way you are sometimes growing,

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.000
shows that you don’t understand
your calibre.

00:41:19.201 --> 00:41:21.372
You don’t know what you are,

00:41:21.573 --> 00:41:27.314
how much the whole atmosphere has
worked out for you,

00:41:27.515 --> 00:41:33.881
the science has been worked out for you.
Science is a gift of the nature.

00:41:34.082 --> 00:41:37.524
All this has been worked out for you

00:41:37.725 --> 00:41:44.537
to achieve the highest state
in the shortest time.

00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:53.171
But for that, one has to be extremely
introspective.

00:41:53.664 --> 00:41:59.113
Instead of thinking of what you have
to achieve: be introspective.

00:41:59.314 --> 00:42:07.742
This introspection will help you and you
will really become real gurus.

00:42:07.943 --> 00:42:14.920
When you go to other villages, other
places, other cities,

00:42:15.121 --> 00:42:21.187
people should know from your being itself
that some great person has come.

00:42:22.084 --> 00:42:26.885
You don’t have to tell, you don’t have
to certify,

00:42:27.086 --> 00:42:33.424
it’s the simplicity of your temperament
itself.

00:42:33.624 --> 00:42:39.832
First time I went to Leningrad, nobody
knew about Me.

00:42:40.033 --> 00:42:47.084
No advertisements, nothing. They just
put some posters, some.

00:42:47.285 --> 00:42:51.058
And there were 2000 people in the hall,
2000 outside.

00:42:51.259 --> 00:42:56.617
In the hall they had to pay, alright.
I was wondering what’s the matter.

00:42:56.818 --> 00:43:02.776
And when I came out I gave them realisation
but I said, “You come tomorrow“.

00:43:02.977 --> 00:43:08.638
So 2000 from inside and 2000 from outside
and about 2000 more came,

00:43:08.839 --> 00:43:12.559
and were all were sitting on the ground.

00:43:12.844 --> 00:43:19.250
I was amazed. I said, “What made you come
to My programme?”

00:43:20.191 --> 00:43:24.274
[They] said, “Mother, so obvious,
Your photograph!”

00:43:24.474 --> 00:43:31.885
Such sensitivity of spirituality:
“So obvious, from Your photograph!”

00:43:32.086 --> 00:43:34.434
And they were scientists, they were
doctors,

00:43:34.635 --> 00:43:37.314
they were all kinds of intelligent people.

00:43:37.523 --> 00:43:42.337
But they could feel the spirituality
from the face.

00:43:44.723 --> 00:43:49.191
That kind of a sensitivity we should have.

00:43:49.392 --> 00:43:51.685
When you don’t need any discretion,
nothing, you know:

00:43:51.886 --> 00:43:54.935
this is this, this is this, this
is this.

00:43:55.136 --> 00:43:59.378
Don’t have to judge, don’t have to think
about it.

00:44:01.211 --> 00:44:08.938
You cannot say who will be best fitted
for this:

00:44:09.139 --> 00:44:12.644
those who have come for the first time,
those who have come later on,

00:44:12.845 --> 00:44:20.868
or those who will be coming, younger
or older, women, men or children.

00:44:21.399 --> 00:44:24.037
It is there.

00:44:25.209 --> 00:44:29.984
In my lifetime if I see so many of you,
so much transformed,

00:44:30.185 --> 00:44:36.504
looking so beautiful, so nice, creating
such a good atmosphere.

00:44:36.781 --> 00:44:39.663
It’s more than satisfaction for Me.

00:44:39.864 --> 00:44:44.963
And sometimes I think I - there is nothing
to be done now anymore – finished.

00:44:45.164 --> 00:44:51.137
But then they invite Me here, and invite Me
there, so I’m just doing.

00:44:51.338 --> 00:44:54.179
But to be very frank I am over satisfied.

00:44:54.380 --> 00:44:59.462
Now, once you have planted the tree…
it’s like a mango tree.

00:44:59.663 --> 00:45:04.773
Once you have planted the mango tree
and looked after it for 3 - 4 years,

00:45:04.981 --> 00:45:08.042
then it looks after itself.

00:45:08.579 --> 00:45:13.875
It gives fruits, it doesn’t need any water,
nothing, it just grows by itself.

00:45:14.076 --> 00:45:20.868
In the same way it should happen with you.
You should grow by yourself.

00:45:21.844 --> 00:45:26.090
Of course, you will find people who are
stupid, who are aggressive,

00:45:26.299 --> 00:45:30.461
who are not at all Sahaja Yogis

00:45:30.662 --> 00:45:33.147
and trying to be Sahaja Yogis.
You’ll find all kinds.

00:45:33.348 --> 00:45:38.554
So just see them, that’s all.

00:45:41.495 --> 00:45:53.686
In this Guru puja, you have to decide
that what are the criteria.

00:45:53.887 --> 00:46:02.694
First a Guru has to be without desires,
any desires whatsoever:

00:46:05.025 --> 00:46:10.677
Nirichcha, as they say. There is one
false guru in India

00:46:10.878 --> 00:46:14.303
who said that, “If I had the powers
as Mother has,

00:46:14.504 --> 00:46:18.594
then I would have become the king
of this world.”

00:46:18.795 --> 00:46:22.701
So people said, “Then why don’t you
become?”

00:46:22.902 --> 00:46:27.920
“Why doesn’t Mother become like that?
Why doesn’t She become the king?”

00:46:28.121 --> 00:46:31.228
So they said, “Because She is Nirichcha -
means She has no desires.

00:46:31.429 --> 00:46:35.715
A person who has no desires will not
become anything.”

00:46:35.916 --> 00:46:42.090
So I said go and tell him, “If you have
desires, you cannot have powers also.”

00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:48.825
It’s only because you have no desires,
that’s why all these powers are there.

00:46:49.026 --> 00:46:54.541
So any desire that comes into your mind,
you should say, “Ah, forget it.

00:46:57.731 --> 00:46:59.512
Just forget it.”

00:46:59.713 --> 00:47:07.710
When the desire is overpowering,
you just divert your attention.

00:47:07.911 --> 00:47:12.497
Any kind of stupid desire can take charge

00:47:12.698 --> 00:47:21.654
and how do you become desireless is
by getting to the thoughtless awareness.

00:47:21.854 --> 00:47:24.744
Any crisis comes in, you should be
able to rise

00:47:24.945 --> 00:47:30.529
into that state of thoughtless awareness.
Just be peaceful.

00:47:31.168 --> 00:47:34.936
Look at your desires with peace.

00:47:35.137 --> 00:47:38.095
You can tell the desire, “Oh, I’m very
much satisfied, now don’t come,

00:47:38.296 --> 00:47:40.874
I don’t want.”

00:47:42.473 --> 00:47:47.013
That’s how you can become desireless.

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:53.215
There is this compassion, and
the compassion

00:47:53.416 --> 00:47:59.807
that becomes actually the power.

00:48:01.021 --> 00:48:08.491
[With] small, small things you can express
your love, very small, small things.

00:48:08.927 --> 00:48:13.728
In very sweet ways you can express
your love.

00:48:14.204 --> 00:48:19.897
Is very important. The whole world needs
today love and peace.

00:48:20.098 --> 00:48:27.120
And you have to give peace and love
to everyone that is possible.

00:48:27.321 --> 00:48:31.893
Of course [with] Sahaja Yogis [it] is
very easy, but even non-sahaja yogis,

00:48:32.094 --> 00:48:36.238
you must treat them with respect and love.

00:48:36.695 --> 00:48:44.080
But you should not have a desire that
you should get back anything from them.

00:48:44.281 --> 00:48:46.830
It’s alright, whatever done, is forgotten.

00:48:47.031 --> 00:48:50.831
You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who
came to Sahaja Yoga, have gained so much

00:48:51.032 --> 00:48:56.813
and have betrayed us – [it] doesn’t matter,
[it’s] not important.

00:48:57.033 --> 00:49:03.112
Because they are going to be losers,
not we.

00:49:03.739 --> 00:49:07.972
So, there’s nothing to bother about
these things.

00:49:08.173 --> 00:49:14.097
Then another thing is: try to see that
your mind doesn’t react.

00:49:14.298 --> 00:49:20.204
Some people have a habit, or I think most
of them have, to react.

00:49:20.595 --> 00:49:27.597
You tell them something, they’ll put their
own one tail with it, something.

00:49:27.987 --> 00:49:32.546
Never will they accept if somebody
says something.

00:49:32.747 --> 00:49:37.139
If you are reacting, what will go into
your heads? What will go into your heart?

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.477
What will go into your attention?

00:49:41.827 --> 00:49:49.715
So the reaction itself is a sign of not
proper development within yourself.

00:49:49.916 --> 00:49:54.502
This attention which is trying to go
into all the areas of your mind

00:49:54.703 --> 00:49:59.559
and your body and everywhere, is not there.

00:49:59.760 --> 00:50:08.319
It cannot enter, because as soon as
it tries to enter, you shut it by reacting.

00:50:08.896 --> 00:50:14.114
You cannot see anything just for seeing
sake, you must react.

00:50:14.315 --> 00:50:18.112
You say, “This is not good, that’s not
good.”

00:50:18.635 --> 00:50:25.311
If I say, “It's 5 o’clock”, you’ll say,
“No, it is 5 past, 2 minutes, 3 seconds.”

00:50:27.347 --> 00:50:32.773
This comes with terrible conditioning
which has to go away.

00:50:32.974 --> 00:50:37.899
Not to react. Why should you react?

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:44.688
Then the argument starts, then fight
starts, then wars come in.

00:50:46.093 --> 00:50:47.931
If you tell your mind,

00:50:48.132 --> 00:50:53.380
“Nothing doing, you are a myth and I am
not going to react to anything!”

00:50:53.872 --> 00:50:58.544
99. 9% problems will be solved.

00:51:04.472 --> 00:51:08.832
Then the last, but not the least is
the ego.

00:51:09.682 --> 00:51:17.095
I can’t understand a saint having a ego,
just can’t understand.

00:51:21.690 --> 00:51:26.324
It’s so stupid to have ego.

00:51:26.525 --> 00:51:33.780
It’s a kind of a domination, if slightest
things are wrong, you get angry.

00:51:34.852 --> 00:51:37.821
If somebody says something, you get angry.

00:51:38.022 --> 00:51:44.450
That means your power of love and
compassion is still not full.

00:51:47.631 --> 00:51:52.777
You can, of course, correct people
when they have to be corrected,

00:51:52.978 --> 00:51:57.915
but for that you should have this power
within yourself.

00:51:58.116 --> 00:52:01.056
The person should know that you are
correcting that person

00:52:01.257 --> 00:52:08.687
because you love that person,
not for selfishness, not for any gain.

00:52:08.888 --> 00:52:13.498
But this ego is a very big problem
and that comes up

00:52:13.699 --> 00:52:23.452
by, I should say, not only ignorance
but stupid ideas about yourself.

00:52:25.483 --> 00:52:32.699
If you think you are something great,
already, then what can you do?

00:52:33.694 --> 00:52:39.124
Ego makes you very arrogant, horrible.

00:52:39.325 --> 00:52:44.945
But if you are humble, really, not to just
to have the humility of a businessman,

00:52:45.114 --> 00:52:49.225
but if you are humble from within yourself,

00:52:49.426 --> 00:52:55.268
from your heart, enjoying your humility,

00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:00.005
then this ego can run away.

00:53:00.206 --> 00:53:03.769
You have to ask yourself, “Now what
are you angry for?”

00:53:03.970 --> 00:53:08.674
Again I come back to the same point:
introspection.

00:53:08.851 --> 00:53:12.888
Because you are not here just to carry on
some jobs,

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:17.969
but you are here to become saints.

00:53:18.811 --> 00:53:28.772
Then this ego should be made into a great
instrument of love and joy.

00:53:28.973 --> 00:53:31.918
You can, it's not difficult.

00:53:32.119 --> 00:53:40.084
This one is what is ego is, reactions
to things.

00:53:40.484 --> 00:53:47.983
You can react to things in a sweet way
or you can react to things in a deadly way.

00:53:49.047 --> 00:53:52.553
Then [the] humour comes in.

00:53:53.491 --> 00:54:03.547
Also you speak as if there is fragrant
flowers which are coming out.

00:54:03.748 --> 00:54:10.323
Then every action of yours, everything
becomes very gentle and sweet.

00:54:10.524 --> 00:54:18.571
Have this ego that will be gentle,
will be kind, will be sweet,

00:54:18.772 --> 00:54:23.833
will be forgiving, will be loving.
Let’s have this ego.

00:54:24.033 --> 00:54:28.041
Start with this kind of a ego – the other
way round.

00:54:28.242 --> 00:54:34.013
You’ll be surprised how you can really
conquer the whole world.

00:54:34.326 --> 00:54:40.019
On this day of Guru Puja, is, Guru is
supposed to tell something

00:54:40.220 --> 00:54:44.322
to his disciples about correcting
themselves.

00:54:44.523 --> 00:54:48.833
In My own sweet way I’ve said to you
which you shouldn’t mind.

00:54:49.034 --> 00:54:52.905
I don’t mean to condemn you by any chance
but to give you

00:54:53.106 --> 00:54:58.691
a proper sense of introspection, proper
sense of introspection

00:54:58.892 --> 00:55:03.531
by which you all get your Gurupada.

00:55:03.732 --> 00:55:10.863
My only, I shouldn’t say desire, because
I don’t have desires.

00:55:11.064 --> 00:55:16.486
So My only vision is, that I should see
all the Sahaja Yogis

00:55:16.687 --> 00:55:23.695
drenched in the power of love, enjoying
each other's love,

00:55:23.896 --> 00:55:31.164
enjoying each other's relationship, and
improving relationships.

00:55:31.594 --> 00:55:35.957
I know there are problematic people,
I know, they are problematic,

00:55:36.158 --> 00:55:42.534
but if you cannot solve the problem
what’s the use of your become masters?

00:55:44.907 --> 00:55:50.562
So, I leave it to you to solve

00:55:51.037 --> 00:55:59.575
your own problems which you are facing.
And introspection,

00:55:59.776 --> 00:56:06.866
with love and compassion, not by condemning
yourself, I am sure you can manage it.

00:56:07.067 --> 00:56:09.968
May God bless you.

five to twelve years old can come.

All the leaders.

01:24:28.098 --> 01:24:37.434
these are praises to the Guru, Shri Mataji,
from Shri Gyaneshwara.

01:24:37.804 --> 01:24:41.356
1) Salutations to You, O Guru Mauli.

01:24:41.557 --> 01:24:47.443
You are famous as One who generously
showers on Your children

01:24:47.644 --> 01:24:53.429
the immaculate and eternal joy, Nirananda.

01:25:01.692 --> 01:25:06.843
[Long pause, during which Shri Mataji says
something to somebody on stage,

01:25:15.864 --> 01:25:21.339
then Yogi Mahajan repeats]

01:26:15.659 --> 01:26:19.765
Salutations to You, O Guru Mauli.

01:26:19.966 --> 01:26:24.765

Please repeat all of you.

01:26:38.617 --> 01:26:42.306
2) O Guru Mauli, the compassionate One,

01:26:42.507 --> 01:26:49.202
when the snake of sensuality takes a grip
on us, and stings us,

01:26:49.403 --> 01:26:55.116
the poison which is difficult to be removed
takes away our awareness.

01:26:55.317 --> 01:27:02.129
But O Mother, with Your just one glance,
that poison vanishes,

01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:05.337
and we get back our awareness.

01:27:05.538 --> 01:27:09.072

01:27:09.273 --> 01:27:14.077

(Shri Mataji says something).
Yogi: Yes, everything.

01:27:17.433 --> 01:27:24.061
The second part everybody should say
together. (Shri Mataji says something) Yes.

01:27:25.239 --> 01:27:29.783
3) Shri Mataji, our most beloved Guru,

01:27:29.992 --> 01:27:33.192
when we have the flood of Your ambrosia,

01:27:33.393 --> 01:27:40.784
how can the heat of mundane life
torment us, or the grief overcome us?

01:27:40.985 --> 01:27:44.637
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:27:44.838 --> 01:27:50.880

that, we Your children, are eternally
enjoying the bliss of Yoga,

01:28:00.292 --> 01:28:04.621

upon us

01:28:04.822 --> 01:28:09.037

in Your lap of supporting Shakti

01:28:26.542 --> 01:28:30.836

01:29:11.070 --> 01:29:16.804
sing to us the lullaby of Anahat sound,
«So-ham» «Ham-sa»

01:29:17.005 --> 01:29:21.942
and put us in the meditative sleep,
with the enlightenment of Spirit.

01:29:31.429 --> 01:29:36.756
8) O Shri Mataji, our Guru, You are
the Mother of all the seekers,

01:29:36.957 --> 01:29:40.733
all Vidyas originate from Your Lotus Feet.

01:29:40.934 --> 01:29:46.024

Your shelter of compassion,

01:30:00.576 --> 01:30:04.691
we become experts in Divine knowledge,
Shuddha Vidya.

the Shuddha Vidya grows in the shelter

Shri Mataji, Your Lotus Feet are verily
our Spirit.

01:30:28.297 --> 01:30:31.627

01:30:37.388 --> 01:30:40.202
11) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:30:40.403 --> 01:30:45.936
Your mere remembrance bestows command
over the universe of words.

01:30:46.137 --> 01:30:51.696
We get the power of effective expression
of subtle feelings through words,

01:30:51.897 --> 01:30:55.941
and the Divine knowledge comes on the tip
of the tongue.

01:30:56.142 --> 01:30:59.231
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:30:59.432 --> 01:31:05.297
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi

01:31:05.498 --> 01:31:09.158
12) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:31:09.359 --> 01:31:12.949
Your mere remembrance makes one’s speech
so sweet

01:31:13.150 --> 01:31:17.253
that it would surpass even the nectar
in its sweetness,

01:31:17.454 --> 01:31:20.812
and all the rasas would become
so submissive

01:31:21.013 --> 01:31:24.457
that they would readily become manifest
through words.

01:31:24.658 --> 01:31:27.675
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:31:27.876 --> 01:31:33.075

By Your grace, such words come
to Your children

01:31:40.055 --> 01:31:43.803
as that can properly express deeper
experience

01:31:44.004 --> 01:31:47.514
and subtle revelations coming from Spirit.

01:31:47.715 --> 01:31:50.834

15) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:32:19.110 --> 01:32:21.748
You are the greatest of all Gods,

01:32:21.949 --> 01:32:27.357
You are the sun that gives the light
of the enlightened knowledge.

01:32:27.558 --> 01:32:31.020
It is by Your grace that the joyous life
of Nirananda

01:32:31.221 --> 01:32:33.109

01:32:50.529 --> 01:32:56.048
You manifest subtle revelations of «So-ham»
in the hearts of Your children.

01:32:56.249 --> 01:33:02.262
You are like the Ocean within whom
rise and recede all the Lokas.

You are prompt to rescue Your children
when they are in trouble.

01:33:18.692 --> 01:33:21.799
You are the eternal Ocean of compassion.

01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.191
All the Divine knowledge is Your
inalienable compassion.

01:33:28.392 --> 01:33:31.601
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:33:31.802 --> 01:33:37.533
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.

01:33:37.741 --> 01:33:40.164
18) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:33:40.365 --> 01:33:43.634
When we are involved in the play
of Your maya,

01:33:43.835 --> 01:33:46.937
we feel as if this mundane world is real.

01:33:47.138 --> 01:33:53.036
But when You manifest Your Brahma rupa,
example Your true form,

01:33:53.237 --> 01:33:56.580
example Your true form of Supreme
God Almighty,

01:33:56.781 --> 01:34:00.012
we realise that Mother, You are
the Omnipresent.

01:34:00.213 --> 01:34:03.284
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:34:03.485 --> 01:34:09.068
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.

01:34:09.277 --> 01:34:11.690
19) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:34:11.891 --> 01:34:14.948
When a magician casts the spell of his
magic,

01:34:15.149 --> 01:34:18.589
his spectators become oblivious to the rest
of the world.

01:34:18.790 --> 01:34:21.441
But the magician cannot hide himself.

01:34:21.642 --> 01:34:24.857
But Shri Mataji, in the spell of Your maya,

01:34:25.058 --> 01:34:27.907
the awareness of the truth about You
is lost,

01:34:28.108 --> 01:34:32.197
and the illusionary mundane world
is taken as reality.

01:34:32.421 --> 01:34:35.359
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:41.186

01:34:41.387 --> 01:34:44.023
20) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:34:44.224 --> 01:34:48.206
You alone are present in everything
in the world.

01:34:48.407 --> 01:34:51.623
To Sahaja Yogis and realised souls,

01:34:51.824 --> 01:34:56.442
You reveal Yourself in Your Brahma Rupa,
and give them the enlightenment,

01:34:56.643 --> 01:35:00.199
while those engrossed in maya are
ignorant about You.

01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:06.068
Shri Mataji, this Leela of Yours
in relation to Yourself is wonderful.

01:35:06.269 --> 01:35:09.357
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:35:09.558 --> 01:35:15.291
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.

01:35:15.499 --> 01:35:17.993
21) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:35:18.194 --> 01:35:22.339
It is Your Shakti which has given to water
its liquid nature,

01:35:22.540 --> 01:35:25.318
and to Mother Earth her forgiving nature.

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:28.678
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:35:28.879 --> 01:35:34.447
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.

01:35:34.648 --> 01:35:37.030
22) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:35:37.231 --> 01:35:42.390
It is Your Shakti that shines through the
sun and the moon in the three worlds.

01:35:42.591 --> 01:35:46.992
But for Your Shakti they would not have
been like shells of mother-pearl.

01:35:47.193 --> 01:35:50.430
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:35:50.631 --> 01:35:56.186
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.

01:35:56.387 --> 01:35:58.911
23) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:35:59.112 --> 01:36:03.399
The wind blows freely everywhere
because of Your power.

01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:06.987
And the sky which is seen to be all
encompassing

01:36:07.188 --> 01:36:10.722
is only but a small part of Your cosmic
being.

01:36:10.923 --> 01:36:15.123
And has to be searched as
in a hide-and-seek game.

01:36:15.324 --> 01:36:18.533
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:36:18.734 --> 01:36:24.379
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.

01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:26.866
24) Not just this, Shri Mataji.

01:36:27.067 --> 01:36:31.436
The Maya is also a constituent of Your
Virata form,

01:36:31.637 --> 01:36:34.785
and the enlightenment is due to Your power.

01:36:34.986 --> 01:36:39.262
Your form could not be understood even
by the Shrutis,

01:36:39.463 --> 01:36:43.122
who had to make futile efforts
to describe You.

01:36:43.323 --> 01:36:46.395
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:36:46.596 --> 01:36:52.345
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.

01:36:52.546 --> 01:36:55.252
25) Salutations to You, Shri Mataji.

01:36:55.453 --> 01:37:00.171
The Vedas were said to be experts
in describing the form of God,

01:37:00.372 --> 01:37:05.518
but it was only till such time they did
not behold Your Brahma Rupa.

01:37:05.719 --> 01:37:08.276
When they start describing Your pure form,

01:37:08.477 --> 01:37:12.914
they become silent as we are
in our meditation.

01:37:13.115 --> 01:37:16.528

01:37:16.729 --> 01:37:22.796

26) Salutations to You Shri Mataji.

01:37:25.908 --> 01:37:28.821
As Your children have cleansed our hearts,

01:37:29.022 --> 01:37:34.261
may Your Lotus Feet be placed
in our hearts.

01:37:34.462 --> 01:37:39.536
Shri Mataji, we wish to offer puja to Your
Lotus Feet in our hearts.

01:37:39.737 --> 01:37:43.091

01:37:49.227 --> 01:37:55.150
27) Shri Mataji, the feeling of oneness
has a cup of our two hands,

01:37:55.351 --> 01:37:59.285
from which we offer at Your Lotus Feet
flower buds

01:37:59.486 --> 01:38:02.821
which are our nadis and chakras and organs.

01:38:03.022 --> 01:38:06.427
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:38:06.628 --> 01:38:13.051

and apply the sandalwood paste

01:38:22.698 --> 01:38:26.599
of dedication to Your Lotus Feet with
our ring finger.

01:38:26.800 --> 01:38:30.107
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:38:30.308 --> 01:38:36.383
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi
namoh namaha.

01:38:36.584 --> 01:38:40.642
29) Shri Mataji, our love for You is
like gold.

01:38:40.843 --> 01:38:44.902
Let us purify that gold and make anklets
from it

01:38:45.103 --> 01:38:47.723
and tie them around Your ankles.

01:38:47.924 --> 01:38:51.099
Yogis: Sakshat Shri Adi Guru Sakshat

01:38:51.300 --> 01:38:57.076
Shri Adi Shakti Mataji Shri Nirmala Devi

Now the international present.

03:00:36.262 --> 03:00:39.263
This is a national present which
is presented by the countries

03:00:39.480 --> 03:00:43.522
which co-organised the puja.

03:02:10.815 --> 03:02:16.539
Guido: As you all know, Shri Mataji has
been always trying to encourage art,

03:02:16.740 --> 03:02:20.832
to support the artists, and She is
travelling all over the world

03:02:21.033 --> 03:02:28.409
collecting pieces, trying to improve
the artisans

03:02:28.610 --> 03:02:31.398
and handicraft all over the world.

03:02:31.599 --> 03:02:39.263
So this time Italy has found some art
pieces from different artists,

03:02:39.464 --> 03:02:45.620
in Sardinia, and we would like
to present Shri Mataji.

03:02:45.915 --> 03:02:55.692
They are all different way of treating
the ceramics.

03:03:00.277 --> 03:03:03.457
Shri Mataji: Where did you get this?
Guido: Sardinia, Shri Mataji.

03:03:03.658 --> 03:03:06.063
Shri Mataji: Eh? Guido: Sardinia.
Shri Mataji: What’s this? Yogini: Sardinia.

03:03:06.264 --> 03:03:10.080
Guido: This is cooked in a wood oven.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

03:03:10.289 --> 03:03:15.137
Guido: Wood oven. Shri Mataji: Wood?
Guido: Wood oven. In the oven...

03:03:15.338 --> 03:03:19.819
Shri Mataji: It’s a marble? (Unclear)
Guido: No, it's made in a wood oven.

03:03:20.027 --> 03:03:24.444
Shri Mataji: Ah! And where did you find it?
Guido: In Sardinia.

03:03:24.645 --> 03:03:32.707
Shri Mataji: Sardinia!
This is Sardinian. That’s beautiful.

03:03:59.104 --> 03:04:03.978
Guido: The another one (?) is from Sicily.
This is all Sardinian.

03:04:04.186 --> 03:04:07.163
Shri Mataji: All Sardinians?
Guido: All Sardinians.

03:04:22.772 --> 03:04:27.193
Shri Mataji: All such is a... (unclear)
Guido: No, only that one.

03:05:45.978 --> 03:05:55.797
Now, you see, every puja I give presents
to all the countries who are hosting:

03:05:56.005 --> 03:05:59.515
to all the ladies, all the men,
the leaders.

03:05:59.716 --> 03:06:05.940
Only in Guru puja, I’m sorry, I’m not
supposed to give any presents to anyone.

03:06:06.149 --> 03:06:14.434
It’s a thing when the guru, only, has
to grab everything from you!

03:06:23.617 --> 03:06:26.404
All this has to be given only on Guru puja:

03:06:26.605 --> 03:06:30.041
specially the saris, that have been given
to Me,

03:06:30.251 --> 03:06:33.690
are all to be given only during Guru puja.

03:06:33.891 --> 03:06:42.834
But I’m sorry, I can’t give anything
to the leaders or to anyone on this day.

03:06:43.035 --> 03:06:46.393
I hope you people don’t mind.

03:06:58.957 --> 03:07:02.885
To be the guru and to be Mother is a very
difficult thing

03:07:03.086 --> 03:07:11.758
because, if you see, the gurus have been
very strict disciplinarians:

03:07:11.959 --> 03:07:17.498
they always try to discipline the disciples
and [be] quite hard with them.

03:07:17.699 --> 03:07:22.899
But the mother can’t be that hard, you see.
This is the trouble with the motherhood is!

03:07:23.100 --> 03:07:29.318
That may be one of the reasons that people
take, sometimes, Sahaja Yoga for granted.

03:07:29.519 --> 03:07:35.242
But you should not, because you have got
your realisation now.

03:07:35.443 --> 03:07:38.938
Now you are realised-souls, you are
masters,

03:07:39.139 --> 03:07:41.515
so you should look after your ascent.

03:07:41.716 --> 03:07:44.795
I don’t have to tell you what [is] to be
done,

03:07:44.996 --> 03:07:49.753
because you have the light in your hand
and you can do that very well.

03:07:49.954 --> 03:07:55.567
I hope today’s lecture, you liked very much
and you don’t mind

03:07:55.768 --> 03:08:00.815
if I have said something that might have
upset you a little bit.

03:08:01.016 --> 03:08:06.400
But it is a thing [that] one has to see
because we all have to grow

03:08:06.601 --> 03:08:11.674
inside and outside and we have to spread
Sahaja Yoga everywhere.

03:08:11.875 --> 03:08:16.028
So we should see everyone - whether
it’s a woman or a man -

03:08:16.229 --> 03:08:20.215
we should see how many people we have
given realisation to.

03:08:20.416 --> 03:08:24.884
It’s very important that you should start
giving realisation all over the world.

03:08:25.085 --> 03:08:30.567
In this fashion it will spread and I don’t
have to then travel so much

03:08:30.768 --> 03:08:33.879
as nowadays I am travelling still.

03:08:34.080 --> 03:08:38.876
I think, you all should take it up upon
yourself that you will do,

03:08:39.083 --> 03:08:44.664
at least if not travelling, around your
cities, around in your places of work,

03:08:44.865 --> 03:08:48.884
you can start talking about Sahaja Yoga
openly.

03:08:49.085 --> 03:08:53.544
All the blessings are there, all the powers
are there, you can work it out very well.

03:08:53.745 --> 03:08:57.247
Anybody you find difficult you give bandhan
and can manage things.

03:08:57.448 --> 03:09:00.345
You know it very well. You know everything
about Sahaja Yoga,

03:09:00.546 --> 03:09:03.809
so I don’t have to tell you about it.
Only thing: use it!

03:09:04.010 --> 03:09:07.971
Even if you have all the instruments and
if you don’t use it, it won’t work out.

03:09:08.172 --> 03:09:13.784
With all My love, with all My blessings,

03:09:13.985 --> 03:09:16.726
I say goodbye now to you, for the time
being.

03:09:16.927 --> 03:09:19.721
Thank you.
