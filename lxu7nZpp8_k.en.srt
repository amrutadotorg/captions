1
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,320
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,200
and were trying to develop your depth.

3
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,960
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,800
But we have to touch that,

5
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,400
that's very important,

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,160
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,720
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

8
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,480
and that's a nice thing.

9
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:44,560
But we have to enjoy our own company also

10
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,000
by meditating, going within yourself.

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,960
Now, “What is the use?”

12
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,640
one may ask. “Mother, now we have got realization,

13
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,080
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

14
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,160
we are doing so well.”

15
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:07,560
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

16
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,480
of all the things, like all the elements.

17
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,160
When you had finished your meditation

18
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,400
you saw how the rain fell down,

19
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,640
how the rain came suddenly.

20
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,640
So rain has felt your depth,

21
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,320
or you have felt the depth of rain.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,400
Now you know that if you light one little candle

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:31,240
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,240
it acts, it reacts

25
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,960
and it gives you a flame which burns,

26
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:42,080
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

27
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,800
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

28
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,560
So all elements have got an effect,

29
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:58,240
if a saint wants to have an effect.

30
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:02,320
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,600
Once you reach your own essences,

32
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:11,240
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

33
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,240
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

34
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,480
or you can order them as you like.

35
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,560
First they will act,

36
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:22,080
expressing that they have been touched

37
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,800
like today, the rain came pouring down.

38
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:29,480
Then later on you can command,

39
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,640
and you can ask the rain to come.

40
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:36,720
To work out many things of that kind

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,800
we have to be deep people,

42
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,320
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

43
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,800
That is, you know very well

44
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,720
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,160
and when we go deep into ourselves,

46
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:57,240
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

47
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,400
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

48
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,960
When we start moving horizontally,

49
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,560
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

50
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,880
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

51
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,640
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

52
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,600
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:31,800
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,320
and then everybody can hear it.

55
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,960
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

56
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:45,480
you find that you have communicated with another person.

57
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,960
But that's only the essence of the ether

58
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:55,280
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

59
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,240
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

60
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,560
we can say, by science,

61
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,320
but you go to the subtler side, and that subtler side

62
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,000
gives you all these effects.

63
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:10,720
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

64
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,000
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

65
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:16,960
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

66
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,880
somebody's with the head the light is coming

67
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,400
you have seen all this.

68
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,240
This is done also by the same method,

69
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:29,720
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

70
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,080
She's very active, She works it out,

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,880
She does all these things.

72
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,400
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

73
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:41,560
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

74
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:47,880
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

75
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,880
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

76
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,960
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:58,400
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

78
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:11,960
So all the, all the essences are working out for you,

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,440
as well as all the deities are working out for you.

80
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,480
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

81
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:23,560
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

82
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,480
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

83
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,800
if you don't keep yourself all right.

84
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,840
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

85
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,880
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

86
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,800
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

87
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,360
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

88
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,800
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

89
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,800
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,720
also the problem of the city where I am,

91
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,920
also the problem of the country where I am,

92
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:54,320
maybe of the whole universe.

93
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,560
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

94
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,640
and I do it quietly.

95
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,560
But you must also understand

96
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:07,000
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

97
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,400
By horizontal movement what happens

98
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,240
that you start meditating on a particular subject

99
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,720
which is a very bothersome subject,

100
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,440
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

101
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,720
Anything – you just put your attention to it and meditate.

102
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:26,520
If you are that deep,

103
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,720
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

104
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:33,120
you will immediately put an effect on that.

105
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

106
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,480
there will be something happening in that direction.

107
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,880
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

108
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,720
So we have to meditate,

109
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:49,160
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

110
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:54,680
so automatically we start solving the problem.

111
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,160
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

112
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:04,240
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,000
to help so many things which are to be helped.

114
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,400
Now you see that people are realizing

115
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,840
that the world is in a great mess,

116
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,080
and there are lots of problems that have come

117
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,080
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

118
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,080
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

119
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,320
We have no time for all this.

120
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,320
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

121
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:35,320
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

122
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:39,960
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

123
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,560
is for the inner improvement as far as the personal side is concerned

124
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,080
means your intelligence must improve,

125
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,640
your temperament must improve,

126
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,800
your heart must clear out,

127
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,720
your feelings must be all right.

128
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:59,560
Then you should, your health should be all right,

129
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,720
then your relationship with others should be all right,

130
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,480
your ego should go away,

131
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,400
your superego should go away

132
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,800
all these things are there.

133
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
But this only helps a personality,

134
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:15,000
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

135
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,440
But now this personality can become an instrument,

136
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,560
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

137
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:24,320
But normally what happens, people are

138
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:27,320
very much still worried about themselves,

139
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,800
say about their wives, about their children,

140
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:36,080
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

141
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,640
These are not important things, because we have to be those

142
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,960
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

143
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,720
we have to develop that depth within us.

144
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,480
That depth is possible,

145
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:54,000
and you can really cure many problems of your country

146
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,040
if you could just meditate on them.

147
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,800
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

148
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,240
which I had felt were there in Canberra

149
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:11,720
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

150
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,040
All these problems came into My understanding,

151
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,520
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

152
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,880
My working style is different because I have very sharp

153
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:27,480
and very effective instruments.

154
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,560
But I have to pay attention to it

155
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,320
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

156
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,400
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

157
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,960
those deeper feelings within you,

158
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
deeper sense within you.

159
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,240
But mostly people are very superficial type.

160
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,560
They just think about their body,

161
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,560
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

162
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:55,880
At the most they’ll think we have to be very legal-minded,

163
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:02,080
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

164
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,560
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

165
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,720
But I think that is not so.

166
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,960
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

167
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,320
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

168
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,880
It's not true also,

169
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:24,400
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

170
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,880
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

171
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,960
but the deeper you go into that love,

172
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:34,720
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

173
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:38,560
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

174
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,560
Gradually that quality improves.

175
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:45,160
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

176
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,800
that house must become auspicious.

177
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,800
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

178
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,720
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

179
00:10:56,960 --> 00:11:03,640
anger, passion, lust, greed,

180
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,560
then such a heart won't affect.

181
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,880
But a person who has purified himself,

182
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,000
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

183
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:16,880
the whole change will take place.

184
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,960
The circumstances will change.

185
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:23,320
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

186
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,280
Like they said, “Mother, as soon as You

187
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,320
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

188
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,360
as far as the television is concerned

189
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,960
and radio is concerned.”

190
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:38,080
I didn't do anything – in a way.

191
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,480
But that should happen with you also.

192
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,560
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

193
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,640
But you have to be a saint,

194
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:53,760
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

195
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:57,760
of another person,

196
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,800
and this is what it is lacking:

197
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:06,040
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

198
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,960
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

199
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,480
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

200
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,400
but it should deepen much more.

201
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,720
You should go further and further.

202
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,840
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

203
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,080
It's the other way round also.

204
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:38,400
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

205
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,200
We all must meditate, that is very important

206
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:45,040
meditate sincerely.

207
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,800
Not just because we have to meditate

208
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:55,120
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

209
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:04,360
to express our great powers of divine love;

210
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:09,240
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

211
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:13,360
I know you all can do it.

212
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,800
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

213
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:20,600
big education for that, nothing is needed.

214
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,880
What is needed is a deep feeling

215
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:31,160
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

216
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,800
The all-destructive forces change their course,

217
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:39,240
and it is then for the constructive forces.

218
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:47,240
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

219
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:53,240
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

220
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,560
with understanding. All right?

221
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:00,080
May God bless you.

222
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:08,640
It is much more than our music,

223
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,840
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

224
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
And now the course has to change.

225
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,160
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

226
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:23,920
So may God bless you for that.
