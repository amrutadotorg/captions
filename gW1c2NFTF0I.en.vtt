00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:05.391
I’m very happy to see all of you here

00:00:05.592 --> 00:00:10.793
and that now we have so many Sahaja Yogis
in Australia.

00:00:16.342 --> 00:00:24.537
I think, Australia has got the second
position in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:24.738 --> 00:00:30.671
Of course, the first position if you
exclude... in the sense that

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:36.817
if you exclude Russia and the Eastern
bloc, then I would say

00:00:37.018 --> 00:00:42.999
maximum number of Sahaja Yogis we have
now in Austria

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.107
and the second is in Australia.

00:00:47.308 --> 00:00:52.028
Today I was late because a phone had -

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:55.282
phone call had come from Austria and they
were trying to talk to Me

00:00:55.483 --> 00:00:59.288
and I was just wondering how it’s such
a coincidence.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.304
Now, we have started in a very bumpy way,
I should say

00:01:06.505 --> 00:01:10.067
to begin with Australian Sahaja Yoga -
we had funny leaders

00:01:10.268 --> 00:01:16.310
and lots of problems were there. But somehow
or other, now we are settling down

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:20.031
and we have a very nice group here and
that people

00:01:20.232 --> 00:01:23.753
understand the value of Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:23.954 --> 00:01:32.034
One thing about Australia is that it’s a
very far off place, a very exclusive place

00:01:32.235 --> 00:01:37.230
and it was surprising to Me that how
Sahaja Yoga prospered here

00:01:37.431 --> 00:01:40.944
so fast and so easily.

00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:49.287
Perhaps maybe one of the reasons that
you are little far away,

00:01:49.488 --> 00:01:54.212
sometimes I don’t know something that
I should know,

00:01:54.413 --> 00:01:57.897
and I know something I need not know.

00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:02.983
So the Australians always write very,
very long letters

00:02:03.199 --> 00:02:06.931
so long that I cannot really read the whole
of it.

00:02:07.132 --> 00:02:11.675
As you know, your Mother has, is very,
very busy, so-called

00:02:11.876 --> 00:02:18.548
and since morning I start reading,
it doesn’t finish till the lunch time.

00:02:18.749 --> 00:02:21.020
So one thing I have to tell you, that
whatever you have to say,

00:02:21.221 --> 00:02:24.492
you should say in short.

00:02:25.447 --> 00:02:28.180
Even then you make it long or short, I can
understand it,

00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.041
what’s the problem is, even with vibrations
I can.

00:02:32.242 --> 00:02:36.802
Moreover, most of them are concerning
themselves,

00:02:37.003 --> 00:02:40.077
all the time concerning themselves like
“I’m sick,

00:02:40.278 --> 00:02:44.860
my daughter is like this, my father is like
this, brother is like this”.

00:02:45.061 --> 00:02:51.485
All regarding themselves. Very exclusive
again.

00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:56.577
Now, I would like to know more about
what you think

00:02:56.778 --> 00:03:00.730
of doing Sahaja Yoga, how you would like
to go, how you would like to proceed,

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:06.037
what is the best way of doing it. In that
case also sometimes I find

00:03:06.238 --> 00:03:10.448
people mostly write about what schemes
they are have to make money,

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.967
how they want to involve Sahaja Yogis
into that money-making propositions,

00:03:14.168 --> 00:03:19.929
this that. So I’m surprised that Sahaja Yoga
is very different thing

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:25.391
and one has to realize that we don’t have
to make money out of Sahaja Yogis

00:03:25.592 --> 00:03:30.715
or their collectivity or anything.
Of course, you need money very well,

00:03:30.916 --> 00:03:35.333
but it should be done on a collective basis
and not on an individual basis.

00:03:35.534 --> 00:03:40.544
So we are trying to plan out something for
you. Maybe work, may work out later on,

00:03:40.745 --> 00:03:43.016
that you might be able to sell some things
here

00:03:43.217 --> 00:03:45.524
and make some money or if you need some.

00:03:45.725 --> 00:03:49.272
But actually in Sahaja Yoga, I’ve found,
we don’t need much money.

00:03:49.473 --> 00:03:54.198
If all of you, who are so many - they said
there are thousand Sahaja Yogis

00:03:54.399 --> 00:04:00.361
in Australia. Thousand is a very big
number. With a thousand Sahaja Yogis,

00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:03.036
I was discussing that why do you have
problem of money.

00:04:03.237 --> 00:04:08.754
You should not have any problem of money.
So maximum how much do you spend?

00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:13.044
They said, “Maximum we spend twenty-five
thousand for the tour

00:04:13.245 --> 00:04:21.171
and all organizing” and all together - they
said - we spend about sixty thousand.”

00:04:21.372 --> 00:04:27.689
It’s very simple. I said, “Everybody,
if they pay six dollars

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:35.763
per year, you can work it out.” Sixty
dollars, I’m sorry, per year.

00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:40.477
It's not much, it’s about five dollars
per month.

00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:43.435
And I said, ‘Is it too much, five dollars?’
I mean,

00:04:43.643 --> 00:04:47.325
I’ve seen here the flowers cost you so.

00:04:47.526 --> 00:04:51.038
So on this point, they said some are very
generous,

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:56.498
but some do not pay a single pai. This is
going too far.

00:04:57.227 --> 00:05:01.413
You see, also it’s a Lakshmi Principle,
must understand.

00:05:01.621 --> 00:05:06.823
If you try to save such a little amount
as that,

00:05:07.378 --> 00:05:12.767
how can you expect Shri Lakshmi Principle
to work out in you.

00:05:12.968 --> 00:05:16.476
You see, you must know what a unique thing
is Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:16.677 --> 00:05:20.648
how it has redeemed you, how you have
transformed you

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.907
and you have landed into such a beautiful
area of God’s kingdom.

00:05:27.108 --> 00:05:33.865
Now this money is not for something that
we use, say, for absurd things,

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:36.454
but is for propagation.

00:05:36.655 --> 00:05:42.369
I come here nowaday, now I’ve decided
to come every second year,

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:47.576
so even this is too much for you to arrange
My tour,

00:05:47.777 --> 00:05:52.157
then I will give up, if you think it is
too much.

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:56.667
Some of the people are like that, very
miserly; and there’s a reputation

00:05:56.868 --> 00:06:00.617
I don’t know why about Australians they’re
a very miserly people.

00:06:00.818 --> 00:06:02.796
They’re not. On the whole they are not.

00:06:02.997 --> 00:06:09.302
On the whole, some of them are extremely
generous and some of them are very miserly;

00:06:09.503 --> 00:06:14.544
who somehow or other confront other people
and a very bad reputation is established.

00:06:14.745 --> 00:06:18.523
So all of you have to be little generous,
otherwise you,

00:06:18.724 --> 00:06:22.182
others who are generous suffer
the consequence.

00:06:22.383 --> 00:06:28.203
As a Mother, I have to tell you that you
have to be generous.

00:06:28.404 --> 00:06:31.772
You know, in the beginning I was paying
all the money for everything,

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:36.467
because My husband also realized that
he should really contribute

00:06:36.668 --> 00:06:40.391
to this noble work so that he is blessed.

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:44.562
And this is where I think Australians are
failing compared to all others

00:06:44.763 --> 00:06:49.147
though they are very many in number.
Now count your blessings.

00:06:49.348 --> 00:06:52.064
First count your blessings and try
to understand

00:06:52.265 --> 00:06:56.949
that what you are doing is no good
for Sahaja Yoga in Australia.

00:06:57.150 --> 00:07:02.986
Those who don’t pay at all are really
people who have not understood Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:03.187 --> 00:07:08.309
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, I don’t need
any money, I don’t want any money.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:15.579
And also somebody told Me that the money
was misplaced in Australia

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:18.852
before, that’s why people are afraid.
That’s no reason.

00:07:19.053 --> 00:07:22.554
You know that now we are handling the money
ourselves. There’s nothing like that

00:07:22.755 --> 00:07:27.034
and we’ve done a lot of work since I have
taken over.

00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:31.928
So one has to understand that this is
a very low-level behavior

00:07:32.129 --> 00:07:38.460
towards Sahaja Yoga; because Sahaja Yoga
has given you so much, so much,

00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:41.997
and you just count what Sahaja Yoga
has given you,

00:07:42.198 --> 00:07:44.682
then it looks very low-level

00:07:44.883 --> 00:07:49.727
that you can’t even contribute six pounds
or five pounds,

00:07:49.928 --> 00:07:53.969
or five dollars, I’m sorry five dollars,
that too Australia.

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:57.733
For your recession, who is responsible?

00:07:58.656 --> 00:08:01.374
How will you progress?

00:08:01.955 --> 00:08:06.432
This is a very delicate subject. I didn’t
want to talk about it,

00:08:06.633 --> 00:08:09.604
but if Australians are known to be like
that,

00:08:09.805 --> 00:08:13.710
I think it’s better to have a proper image.

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:19.302
Actually the main, heavy things that are
paid

00:08:19.503 --> 00:08:23.149
like building ashrams, building schools and
all that

00:08:23.351 --> 00:08:25.620
do not come from your money at all, not
a single pai,

00:08:25.821 --> 00:08:30.669
from your money nothing comes out. It comes
out of International Funds,

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:35.966
out of people who are extremely generous
and also partly from Me

00:08:36.167 --> 00:08:43.003
and if some money is left over
with the tour.

00:08:43.537 --> 00:08:47.911
So this one I had to talk to you today.
Saturday is all right, not on Easter Day

00:08:48.112 --> 00:08:51.645
I wouldn’t talk all these things, but today
is the day when you should know

00:08:51.846 --> 00:08:57.166
that Christ was suffering, and this is
the time we have to understand

00:08:57.367 --> 00:09:01.069
that you are not in the suffering any more,
you have come out.

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:05.108
But the way you treat Sahaja Yoga is just
a side issue,

00:09:05.309 --> 00:09:08.483
like buying a magazine sort of a thing.
It’s not good.

00:09:08.684 --> 00:09:11.676
You are not paying due respect to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:09:11.877 --> 00:09:17.700
It’s of course your dedication is important,
meditation is much more important,

00:09:17.901 --> 00:09:20.727
but little money you must keep for Sahaja
Yoga.

00:09:20.928 --> 00:09:23.628
There is no need for you to pay

00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:27.979
like the way you pay for these gurus and
all that, nothing of the kind.

00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:34.858
But a little money you should learn to take
it out with respect, with dedication

00:09:35.059 --> 00:09:39.294
because after all we have to pay in some
places.

00:09:39.495 --> 00:09:42.743
I should not talk about these things, and
I have told Steven

00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:48.253
to circulate a letter of requesting them,
telling them what’s the problem is.

00:09:48.461 --> 00:09:55.651
It is a, I mean in India, they are anxious
to pay for Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:55.852 --> 00:09:59.140
and in every country I’ve seen they are
anxious to pay.

00:09:59.341 --> 00:10:08.514
So this kind of an atmosphere and this kind
of a beautiful gathering that we have,

00:10:08.722 --> 00:10:12.286
we should also think what we can do
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:12.487 --> 00:10:18.015
The second thing you have to do that as you
have got your Realization,

00:10:18.216 --> 00:10:22.647
others also should get it. So you have
to form groups,

00:10:22.848 --> 00:10:27.687
go round the cities, go round to the smaller
places and try to spread it.

00:10:27.888 --> 00:10:31.829
Some people do it. Definitely, some people
do it,

00:10:32.030 --> 00:10:36.029
but there are thousand Sahaja Yogis,
if they do it every year

00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:40.754
they can increase and multiply like
anything.

00:10:40.955 --> 00:10:45.338
If you can really always think that we have
to do something for Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:45.539 --> 00:10:49.828
you can go out on Saturdays, Sundays, form
your music groups

00:10:50.029 --> 00:10:56.429
or anything and try to establish Sahaja
Yoga outside.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:02.682
You are duty-bound to do it. Like when
this light was not there, it was all right,

00:11:02.883 --> 00:11:05.457
but when it has got the light, it has
to give the light,

00:11:05.658 --> 00:11:08.873
that is the duty of the light, it’s
the nature of the light.

00:11:09.074 --> 00:11:14.442
That’s what you have to do, is to spread
Sahaja Yoga as much as possible.

00:11:14.643 --> 00:11:20.243
The third thing I feel, that I should point
it out,

00:11:20.444 --> 00:11:24.040
that when it came to going to America
nobody wrote to Me.

00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:26.859
Nobody told Me that people are going
to America.

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:32.525
It’s very wrong, because in America Sahaja
Yoga is not at all established.

00:11:32.726 --> 00:11:37.593
There are very few Sahaja Yogis. Secondly,
you just went there for a holiday

00:11:37.794 --> 00:11:40.056
or some sort of a thing I don’t know what.

00:11:40.257 --> 00:11:45.543
I have already told you that America is
hell. Why do you want to go to America?

00:11:46.182 --> 00:11:49.339
There are other places you could have gone.
You could have worked there,

00:11:49.540 --> 00:11:53.827
but you put pressure on those people who
were there. Not only that, but you caught

00:11:54.028 --> 00:11:58.085
all kinds of funny things from that
horrible land of America.

00:11:58.286 --> 00:12:03.989
Americans as you know are very, very
immature.

00:12:04.211 --> 00:12:06.735
They don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.
All kinds of gurus are there.

00:12:06.936 --> 00:12:10.734
There are witchcraft, legally accepted
things like that.

00:12:10.935 --> 00:12:14.370
Of all the places why should you go
to America, I can’t understand.

00:12:14.571 --> 00:12:18.010
And people just went there to America, was
a very wrong thing to do -

00:12:18.211 --> 00:12:23.164
without even telling Me, without even
informing Me, they went there,

00:12:23.365 --> 00:12:26.367
otherwise I would have stopped it.

00:12:27.759 --> 00:12:30.810
The another difficulty came up for Me
very much,

00:12:31.011 --> 00:12:35.067
that because you had not decided to go
for a India tour,

00:12:35.268 --> 00:12:39.422
this is the last time we’ll have such
a tour which was so expensive.

00:12:39.623 --> 00:12:42.760
But it was all thought that all Sahaja
Yogis

00:12:42.961 --> 00:12:46.215
will enjoy in the same amount that you have
been paying.

00:12:46.416 --> 00:12:53.354
We started this idea, everybody knew
about it, but at the last moment

00:12:53.555 --> 00:12:58.403
when I went to England, to find out there
was no money at all.

00:12:58.604 --> 00:13:02.588
So I had to borrow money and do
the business.

00:13:02.789 --> 00:13:06.451
This is very, very troublesome and you
don’t want your Mother to be troubled

00:13:06.652 --> 00:13:10.979
for nothing at all. And then suddenly
so many came.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.342
You see, how you understand that supposing
you have to take this place,

00:13:16.543 --> 00:13:20.321
you cannot just last moment come and say,
‘Oh no, we want to take this place.’

00:13:20.522 --> 00:13:26.814
You have to organize all your travel
by train, by buses, by this, by that.

00:13:27.015 --> 00:13:31.444
How much Indians work. They organize
everything throughout.

00:13:31.645 --> 00:13:38.404
This time they really got absolutely upset
because some people just came to Delhi,

00:13:38.605 --> 00:13:45.727
some people came through the Hariyana tour,
some went to another part.

00:13:45.928 --> 00:13:50.553
But the worst is some of them just came
after Poona.

00:13:50.754 --> 00:13:54.231
They said, ‘We’ll do half.’ You better
not come.

00:13:54.432 --> 00:13:58.061
If you have no money, you need not come.
‘Mother, give us half,’

00:13:58.262 --> 00:14:02.851
then one-fourth, then one-fifth. I mean,
there’s no bargain about it.

00:14:03.052 --> 00:14:06.435
The money that you give is for the full
tour

00:14:06.636 --> 00:14:10.455
because we have to organize it on that
premises.

00:14:10.656 --> 00:14:12.751
For example, you go anywhere now.

00:14:12.952 --> 00:14:15.498
There’s a, they’ll say, ‘Now, there is
a train available

00:14:15.699 --> 00:14:19.286
if you have five hundred passengers.’
So we take the whole train.

00:14:19.487 --> 00:14:23.259
All right, now you only, say, three hundred
people pay,

00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.257
then all the two hundred who is going
to pay?

00:14:28.308 --> 00:14:34.272
It is something you are away from the rest
of the world, sitting down here,

00:14:34.473 --> 00:14:39.245
enjoying Sahaja Yoga. You don’t understand
that all these things have caused

00:14:39.446 --> 00:14:43.960
lot of problems and a deficit, big deficit.

00:14:44.161 --> 00:14:49.578
I don’t know what has happened, I’m now
going back to Cabella to sit down

00:14:49.779 --> 00:14:55.324
and find out about the accounts, which
I am very bad at it.

00:14:55.525 --> 00:15:00.334
And the more you only care for such things,
the worse it will be.

00:15:01.454 --> 00:15:05.837
I have to tell you that it’s - there’s no
planning needed as such,

00:15:06.038 --> 00:15:12.790
but anywhere in modern times, if you have
to go, you have to do it beforehand.

00:15:12.991 --> 00:15:16.363
It’s not just you reach there and say:
“All right, Mother, we are here now”.

00:15:16.564 --> 00:15:23.185
Do what you like. All these things have
really upset

00:15:23.386 --> 00:15:29.780
the Sahaja Yogis in New Delhi and
in Bombay. And they have sent Me word

00:15:29.981 --> 00:15:33.979
that ‘Mother, please tell all the Sahaja
Yogis all over the world,

00:15:34.180 --> 00:15:37.776
specially, specially Australians

00:15:37.977 --> 00:15:44.044
that they should take a decision before
at least a month.’

00:15:44.245 --> 00:15:50.050
So if you could decide in October it would
be better.

00:15:50.251 --> 00:15:54.331
And send over the money because if you
borrow the money from the bank,

00:15:54.532 --> 00:15:58.017
you know you have to pay interest also.

00:15:59.034 --> 00:16:03.635
So, I know children sometimes don’t behave
properly,

00:16:03.836 --> 00:16:08.672
but you don’t want Me to have trouble
of this kind

00:16:08.873 --> 00:16:13.661
and a Mother has to tell the children what
are her problems are.

00:16:13.862 --> 00:16:18.794
On the whole, there are some Sahaja Yogis
in Australia who are tremendous.

00:16:18.995 --> 00:16:23.483
They are doing so well. They send such
beautiful cards to Me.

00:16:23.684 --> 00:16:30.289
They write such beautiful poems that really
I don’t know how to thank them.

00:16:30.490 --> 00:16:36.646
But first of all, you have a duty to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:36.847 --> 00:16:40.779
Secondly, it is for you to enjoy Sahaja
Yoga,

00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:44.520
but also to see that by your behavior

00:16:44.721 --> 00:16:49.526
you don’t trouble other Sahaja Yogis
all over the world.

00:16:50.787 --> 00:16:55.880
Sahaja Yoga has so much progressed here.
It’s a very, very surprising thing.

00:16:56.089 --> 00:16:59.669
We had a very bumpy start, I told you.
I used to think that

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:04.182
Sahaja Yoga in Australia will be
disappearing into Indian Sea or something,

00:17:04.383 --> 00:17:09.142
but we have now people who understand
what is Sahaja Yoga

00:17:09.343 --> 00:17:14.163
and also you have very, very good leaders
practically everywhere.

00:17:14.363 --> 00:17:21.685
Also they understand Sahaja Yoga very well
and they think it’s a very important thing

00:17:21.886 --> 00:17:26.199
and try to think how important is Sahaja
Yoga.

00:17:27.225 --> 00:17:29.979
With all those things, you see,

00:17:30.180 --> 00:17:33.921
a very, very simple understanding should
be there

00:17:34.122 --> 00:17:39.074
that we belong to one family. When I come
here I feel a joy

00:17:39.275 --> 00:17:43.350
of a Mother who has come to meet all
Her children, Her family

00:17:43.551 --> 00:17:47.227
and, if we are in a family, we bear
a responsibility.

00:17:47.428 --> 00:17:52.438
I don’t want to put any pressure on you,
on money, which is not reasonable.

00:17:52.639 --> 00:17:56.682
But you should be also reasonable about it
and try to think

00:17:56.883 --> 00:18:01.950
in a serious manner that whatever Mother
is doing, whatever She’s trying,

00:18:02.151 --> 00:18:07.690
we should not put a burden on Her. So
for one thing I must congratulate you

00:18:07.891 --> 00:18:11.786
that all the collectivity has come back
to normal. Even in Melbourne

00:18:11.987 --> 00:18:18.418
I was surprised how the collectivity has
come back and is helping everyone.

00:18:18.627 --> 00:18:24.562
Leaders, all of Australia I talked to them
one by one

00:18:24.763 --> 00:18:29.621
and they only say that “They are all right,
for Pujas, they are very good.

00:18:29.822 --> 00:18:33.444
They are good for other collective things
we do.

00:18:33.645 --> 00:18:41.746
But as far as working for Sahaja Yoga,
you’ll get handful of...

00:18:41.963 --> 00:18:46.410
When it comes to working for Sahaja Yoga,
very few will be available.

00:18:46.611 --> 00:18:50.556
Most of them think it’s a sort
of a by-the-way job.

00:18:50.757 --> 00:18:57.444
“I’m busy with this. I’m busy with that.”
But that is not the way.

00:18:57.645 --> 00:19:01.854
You are really showing your sense
of gratitude.

00:19:02.055 --> 00:19:08.582
If you want to show the sense of your
gratitude, then you must run

00:19:08.783 --> 00:19:12.001
to ask, ‘What do you want me to do?
What should I do?’

00:19:12.202 --> 00:19:15.130
Now, in Poona when I went, I was
so surprised,

00:19:15.331 --> 00:19:19.777
the Yuva Shakti, the young Sahaja Yogis,

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:27.780
they came to receive Me, six of them, all
in a turban and in a very classical dresses

00:19:27.981 --> 00:19:32.945
with a big bugle and all kinds of things
to receive Me.

00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:38.760
All the way on the road, they had built
about twenty-five to thirty big gates for Me

00:19:38.961 --> 00:19:44.911
on the way, and also had advertised
all over, all over Poona.

00:19:45.112 --> 00:19:51.836
And I was amazed we had a hundred thousand
people for the program.

00:19:52.037 --> 00:19:54.808
Can you believe it?

00:19:56.255 --> 00:20:01.196
And then second time, when I went
to Bombay, I was surprised really.

00:20:01.397 --> 00:20:05.921
We have a park called Shivaji Park and
there always had been big meetings

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:09.649
of Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru,
this, that.

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:15.235
And I was amazed that they all said, ‘There
has been never such a big number

00:20:15.436 --> 00:20:18.946
of at least 125,000 people.’

00:20:19.147 --> 00:20:22.457
All done by the people, everybody working
out,

00:20:22.658 --> 00:20:25.985
anybody who knew this one, he brought this,
he brought that

00:20:26.186 --> 00:20:29.910
and, by doing that, you see the expenses
were much less

00:20:30.111 --> 00:20:32.596
and they never put a pressure on Me
for money.

00:20:32.797 --> 00:20:36.298
Never. I have never seen these people.
They are not so rich as you are.

00:20:36.499 --> 00:20:41.531
You are very rich people. But they have
never put any pressure on Me.

00:20:41.732 --> 00:20:45.848
To them Sahaja Yoga is their life, Sahaja
Yoga is their aim

00:20:46.049 --> 00:20:50.408
and Sahaja Yoga is totality.

00:20:50.609 --> 00:20:56.271
So with all this, I have to tell you that
your… I’ve told the leaders

00:20:56.472 --> 00:20:59.747
to make a list of people who do not pay
money,

00:20:59.948 --> 00:21:03.937
also to make a list of people who do not
help in the work;

00:21:04.138 --> 00:21:07.749
not the ones who help, but those who do not
help, so I’ll put a bandhan on them

00:21:07.950 --> 00:21:13.026
and let them feel that it is important what
we have to do.

00:21:13.234 --> 00:21:17.744
Last but not the least, the problem
of certain marriages

00:21:17.945 --> 00:21:23.478
which crop up very much here, I am
surprised.

00:21:23.679 --> 00:21:27.748
Men, you are to be married, you are given
full chance to decide

00:21:27.949 --> 00:21:33.054
whom do you want to marry. And after
marriage

00:21:34.768 --> 00:21:41.284
it goes off. Mostly it is the mistake
of the women here, I’m very surprised,

00:21:41.485 --> 00:21:43.795
because always it’s the woman who
dominates,

00:21:43.996 --> 00:21:46.728
see she wants this, she wants that,
like that.

00:21:46.929 --> 00:21:51.647
Now, you have to know that women are very
important for society.

00:21:51.848 --> 00:21:56.191
Your problem is not so much of political
problems or economic problems, as such.

00:21:56.392 --> 00:21:59.672
It is always common like that in every
Western country.

00:21:59.881 --> 00:22:03.874
But the main problem you are facing is
your society.

00:22:04.075 --> 00:22:07.402
You know what’s happening in your society,
what a terrible society it is,

00:22:07.603 --> 00:22:11.773
how the children are harmed, how the women
are tortured,

00:22:11.974 --> 00:22:14.531
how so many things are happening
in our society

00:22:14.732 --> 00:22:18.286
and all kinds of filthy things are
happening

00:22:18.487 --> 00:22:23.418
which cannot be called as anywhere near
advancement.

00:22:23.619 --> 00:22:28.987
All these things we see around us and we
see our children suffer with that.

00:22:29.188 --> 00:22:35.018
So what - who is responsible
for the society? Women.

00:22:35.219 --> 00:22:39.919
Women are responsible for the society.
They have to do it.

00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:46.583
I’m also a woman and I understand that
to Me society is so important.

00:22:46.784 --> 00:22:50.141
I should not Myself do something that is
wrong.

00:22:50.342 --> 00:22:53.717
I should not allow My children to do
something wrong.

00:22:53.918 --> 00:22:57.237
Now, if children are

00:22:59.032 --> 00:23:02.020
not meditating, they are not footsoaking -

00:23:02.221 --> 00:23:06.991
I was told that nobody can corrected
anybody else’s child.

00:23:07.192 --> 00:23:11.728
If somebody says something to somebody’s
child, they’ll be angry.

00:23:11.929 --> 00:23:14.323
Even Indian ladies, I was surprised,
don’t like

00:23:14.524 --> 00:23:18.853
anybody correcting their child. It’s not
in India. Never.

00:23:19.054 --> 00:23:21.834
If one woman does that, she’ll be discarded
from the society.

00:23:22.035 --> 00:23:26.792
Anybody can correct you and parents thank
that person.

00:23:26.993 --> 00:23:31.424
Say, when we were young,

00:23:31.625 --> 00:23:35.944
supposing on the road we are laughing,
say that could be a joke, we are walking.

00:23:36.145 --> 00:23:39.314
And somebody informed My mother, she would
shout at us,

00:23:39.515 --> 00:23:42.778
‘What business you had to make jokes
on the street and laugh like that?

00:23:42.979 --> 00:23:48.810
It’s very cheapish.’ But she would never
shout at the person who reported.

00:23:49.011 --> 00:23:53.272
That was not done. So this is another thing
I want to tell you very frankly,

00:23:53.481 --> 00:23:57.372
that no parents should feel bad if somebody
corrects the child.

00:23:57.573 --> 00:24:00.406
Should thank that person because
your children need

00:24:00.607 --> 00:24:03.149
too much of correction, you have no idea.

00:24:03.350 --> 00:24:04.850
When we started the school,

00:24:05.051 --> 00:24:08.263
just after two month they gave up, said
‘These are not children.

00:24:08.464 --> 00:24:13.141
These are coming from some jungles and they
bite us, and they hit us,

00:24:13.342 --> 00:24:21.038
and they take out all our belongings and
throw them.’

00:24:21.239 --> 00:24:24.627
They were so horrible hooligans.

00:24:24.828 --> 00:24:29.055
For two months they tried and they gave up.
They said, “Close this school.

00:24:29.256 --> 00:24:32.272
We can’t have. We’ll have Indian children.”

00:24:32.473 --> 00:24:36.223
I told them - I gave them one ebony rod,
so big as that, black.

00:24:36.424 --> 00:24:38.939
Said, ‘You show them this. Say that this
Mother has given.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.215
Anybody who tries to misbehave, we’ll touch
that person with this”.

00:24:43.416 --> 00:24:46.106
And they were all right.

00:24:46.749 --> 00:24:50.376
They started behaving all right. Otherwise
this school would not have been there.

00:24:50.577 --> 00:24:53.275
You don’t know how terrible they were.
They were used,

00:24:53.476 --> 00:24:55.539
they used to threaten that ‘We’ll jump
down the cliff’

00:24:55.740 --> 00:25:02.511
or they used to climb over the trees or
on top of the roof also, like monkeys.

00:25:02.712 --> 00:25:06.442
Just like monkeys, without any discipline,
without anything.

00:25:06.643 --> 00:25:09.834
So your children need much more correction
than anybody else.

00:25:10.035 --> 00:25:13.662
Not only Australia, I mean any on
of the foreigners, they need.

00:25:13.863 --> 00:25:17.993
So it’s better that you allow others
to correct your children.

00:25:18.194 --> 00:25:22.338
And I’m surprised that Indian ladies
objecting to it.

00:25:22.539 --> 00:25:26.915
They are also learning bad things from here
I think. This is never in India.

00:25:27.116 --> 00:25:30.951
Nobody does that and that’s why Indian
children are much better.

00:25:31.152 --> 00:25:35.233
You will not - you have, you must have
noticed Indian children in a group there,

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:37.864
how they behave, how quiet they are, how

00:25:38.065 --> 00:25:42.208
how sweetly they are listening
to everything. Very nice.

00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:45.133
The reason is they are disciplined not only
by parents,

00:25:45.334 --> 00:25:51.007
but by the whole society. And the idea is
that everybody loves your children.

00:25:51.208 --> 00:25:54.295
They are the children of the whole society.
We live collectively.

00:25:54.496 --> 00:25:57.924
We are not individualistic. And if they
find anything wrong with the child,

00:25:58.125 --> 00:26:01.777
they should correct. Of course if you find
somebody who is doing it just

00:26:01.978 --> 00:26:08.106
to show their anger or temper, then you can
report to the leader,

00:26:08.307 --> 00:26:10.351
but normally it should be treated…

00:26:10.552 --> 00:26:14.911
After all, you are all parents and you know
what is good for children.

00:26:15.119 --> 00:26:21.808
I was amazed that children are not allowed
at all to be corrected by anybody else

00:26:22.009 --> 00:26:27.135
because, you see, a child, you must know,
is a big responsibility

00:26:27.336 --> 00:26:31.031
and only the mother cannot control, only
the father cannot control.

00:26:31.232 --> 00:26:34.479
The whole society has to control and
discipline the child.

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:39.553
So the idea of good mannerism - this is not
good manners. These are not good manners.

00:26:39.754 --> 00:26:41.697
You see, we should know, these are not
good manners.

00:26:41.898 --> 00:26:43.439
One should feel very shy about it.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.611
I remember once my grand-daughter we had
taken her to Brighton

00:26:47.812 --> 00:26:56.693
and she wanted to go on a ride on a - they
have what small, small trains.

00:26:56.894 --> 00:27:01.142
So they went round and came back. Still
she wanted to do it again

00:27:01.343 --> 00:27:05.271
and I said, “No, no, you can’t do it.
We have to go now.”

00:27:05.472 --> 00:27:07.753
Then she looked at her mother and started
crying.

00:27:07.954 --> 00:27:11.913
Mother said, ‘Whether you cry or anything,
you are not to go again. That’s what it is.’

00:27:12.114 --> 00:27:16.262
She must have cried for about, say, five
minutes and then she felt so ashamed

00:27:16.463 --> 00:27:20.750
she put both the hands on her face. So she
was very young,

00:27:20.951 --> 00:27:25.183
so must be about four years. I said,
“Why are you hiding your face?”

00:27:25.384 --> 00:27:28.743
‘Because I misbehaved.’

00:27:30.004 --> 00:27:32.762
These are not good manners. From very
childhood, you must tell

00:27:32.963 --> 00:27:37.663
your children what are bad manners and
what is their position.

00:27:37.864 --> 00:27:44.044
They are Sahaja Yogis. Put them up.
Tell them what is their dignity,

00:27:44.245 --> 00:27:49.017
how they are, they - how special they are,
how much God’s work they are going to do,

00:27:49.218 --> 00:27:51.838
they are in the kingdom of God, they can’t
behave like this.

00:27:52.039 --> 00:27:55.326
Anybody who tells you should not mind
because it’s all for their good.

00:27:55.550 --> 00:27:58.298
It doesn’t, in no way harm your child,

00:27:58.499 --> 00:28:03.446
but this shows your, what you call, mamat
where you say that you are attached,

00:28:03.647 --> 00:28:05.353
“It’s my child. That’s his child. That’s
his child.”

00:28:05.554 --> 00:28:11.446
Nothing like that. In Sahaja Yoga every
child belongs to everyone

00:28:11.647 --> 00:28:14.498
and that is what we have to show
in our life.

00:28:14.699 --> 00:28:16.858
Even our things in the West I have seen,

00:28:17.059 --> 00:28:20.874
people if they think belongs to somebody
else, they’ll just spoil it.

00:28:21.075 --> 00:28:25.553
If it is theirs, then they’ll keep it very
carefully, not to be touched.

00:28:25.754 --> 00:28:30.864
That’s not Sahaj culture. Sahaj culture,
I’ll tell you what, like supposing

00:28:31.065 --> 00:28:34.831
if there’s a spoon from somebody’s family
has come in the house,

00:28:35.032 --> 00:28:39.041
everybody will be telling us, ‘Is it there
or not? Have you returned it (or) not?’

00:28:39.242 --> 00:28:41.631
Even a spoon, they’ll eat us off.

00:28:41.832 --> 00:28:45.387
I tell you this not only with Me but any
Indian family.

00:28:45.588 --> 00:28:49.029
Not that all Indian culture is all right,
but quite a lot is needed

00:28:49.230 --> 00:28:52.953
to compensate for this kind of a culture
where everybody is free,

00:28:53.154 --> 00:28:57.099
do what you like, live as you like.

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.494
So also you have to train them up, how they
should live,

00:29:00.695 --> 00:29:04.280
how they should keep their things.
For example, in Cabella we had

00:29:04.481 --> 00:29:08.780
children and we had parents and they were
putting them in their own rooms.

00:29:08.981 --> 00:29:11.609
I said, “No, there’s no need you to -
there’s so many rooms.

00:29:11.810 --> 00:29:14.968
We make one room for the children.
And let them feel

00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:18.597
that this is their room, they have to look
after it.” I was so surprised.

00:29:18.798 --> 00:29:22.850
The same children who were spoiling
their parents’ rooms all the time

00:29:23.051 --> 00:29:26.513
started with their little, little hands
carrying their blankets, little blankets

00:29:26.714 --> 00:29:30.534
and everything and putting it up nicely,
keeping it clean

00:29:30.735 --> 00:29:34.134
and “Mother is going to come”, so they
put up some flowers.

00:29:34.335 --> 00:29:37.834
I said “So sweet”. I said, “The same
children about whom parents were saying,

00:29:38.035 --> 00:29:40.916
‘Mother, they’re hopeless. Every day
we have to spend so much time

00:29:41.117 --> 00:29:43.587
on their thing, they put this thing here
and put there’.”

00:29:43.788 --> 00:29:46.948
So to make them responsible. And so sweetly
they did it.

00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:51.217
They are all below five years, from two
years to five years, imagine.

00:29:51.418 --> 00:29:54.991
So sweetly they did it and for Me also they
made a seat

00:29:55.192 --> 00:29:57.542
and wouldn’t allow the adults to do
anything.

00:29:57.743 --> 00:30:00.410
So I was surprised, the same children
how they have changed.

00:30:00.611 --> 00:30:03.549
Only by getting a dignified place
for themselves

00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:06.934
and an understanding that they have to do
something.

00:30:07.135 --> 00:30:10.770
So too much of protectiveness is not
needed,

00:30:10.971 --> 00:30:14.289
and abandonment is also not. You have to be
in the centre,

00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:18.986
tell your children how to behave and what
is the good manners are.

00:30:19.187 --> 00:30:22.838
They should know, “These are bad manners.
We just can’t do it

00:30:23.039 --> 00:30:27.125
We just can’t do it. Bad manners.” And
this, if you tell, they will understand,

00:30:27.326 --> 00:30:30.648
because we must face our children. We have
to tell them.

00:30:30.849 --> 00:30:32.769
Whatever is wrong we have to tell them.

00:30:32.970 --> 00:30:35.853
I’m sorry today I took too much time and
I hope

00:30:36.054 --> 00:30:42.430
your leader will forgive Me for this…
because…

00:30:46.024 --> 00:30:51.805
I’m just trying to use this time
for something really very much needed.

00:30:52.006 --> 00:30:55.531
I never get a chance to talk to Sahaja
Yogis in this way.

00:30:55.732 --> 00:30:57.966
When it’s a Puja time, it’s so auspicious

00:30:58.167 --> 00:31:04.319
that you don’t want to say anything that
will make people little unhappy.

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:12.772
So I have a feeling of a Mother who loves
Her children very much

00:31:12.973 --> 00:31:20.501
and who wants Her children to enjoy life
fully in the Kingdom of God.

00:31:20.702 --> 00:31:23.220
So I hope you don’t mind whatever I have
said

00:31:23.421 --> 00:31:27.135
and whatever I have done is all for
our good.

00:31:27.336 --> 00:31:30.250
May God bless you.

00:31:33.557 --> 00:31:38.116
There’s some more time can you give Me –
the leaders?

00:31:47.878 --> 00:31:51.098
This is the first time I saw everything
so organized

00:31:51.299 --> 00:31:55.688
according to time and this is the first
time I’ve let you down.

00:31:59.008 --> 00:32:02.478
It’s a - you know because of your customs,

00:32:02.679 --> 00:32:05.087
you know what is the situation is, you
can’t bring too many things

00:32:05.288 --> 00:32:08.863
but whatever I could I’ve got it
for the leaders and all that,

00:32:09.064 --> 00:32:14.940
so I’ll just now read the names and then
you can collect it from Vinay.

00:32:17.878 --> 00:32:22.386
This is for all the leaders here:

00:32:23.713 --> 00:32:33.031
Mr Steven and then John, then Michael, Ben,
Hugh -

00:32:33.232 --> 00:32:42.502
what’s the name? Albert. - Albert, then
John Henshaw, and who? Robin, Robin Reed.

00:32:42.703 --> 00:32:49.209
Then also for ladies, according
to the leadership, leaders’ wives is:

00:32:54.362 --> 00:33:06.756
Marylin? Marylin, and we have Sue, Jo,
Savita – Brisbane, who is from Brisbane?

00:33:06.990 --> 00:33:17.139
Albert’s wife – and Jennie, and Gulsha (?)
what’s kind of a name?”

00:33:18.987 --> 00:33:23.490
So this is, these are the names
of the people who are leaders,

00:33:23.691 --> 00:33:28.002
Savita because she really worked very hard
for Me.

00:33:28.203 --> 00:33:32.190
So that’s how we have presents for them,
very small presents,

00:33:32.391 --> 00:33:36.567
I hope you all can take it from Vinay.
I have already touched them, blessed them,

00:33:36.768 --> 00:33:41.746
so it’s alright, we can save some time.

00:33:53.094 --> 00:33:56.858
Also they wanted Me to bring some sarees…
(Yogi says in Hindi, “Sold it”).

00:33:57.058 --> 00:34:01.401
Sold it! (Yogi: Yes) I hoped you liked
them.
