00:03:33.613 --> 00:03:39.308
Rahuri is a place where a rakshasa called,

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:43.059
demon called Rahu was killed by Goddess.

00:03:43.275 --> 00:03:48.789
And this is the place where my forefathers

00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:56.098
reigned as kings, and they had a dynasty
also.

00:03:58.607 --> 00:04:01.491
Now, the other place we went to, Musalwadi,
is the place where

00:04:01.691 --> 00:04:08.469
the Goddess first of all hit him with
a beam,

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.456
so it is called as Musalwadi. It means
a beam, ‘musal’ means a ‘beam’.

00:04:14.657 --> 00:04:18.353
So this is a place where [the] Goddess has
done a lot of work.

00:04:18.554 --> 00:04:23.651
here is another place called Aradgaon where
he was running and he was screaming,

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:28.148
so it’s called as arad. ‘Arad’ means
‘screaming’ (‘gaon’ means village).

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:31.104
So the whole place is already very much
vibrated

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:37.219
because also the Nathas, the nine Nathas —
we saw one Kanifnath there —

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.521
but all of them lived in this area and
worked very hard.

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.351
The last of all, Sainath, was very near
here, as you know, in Shirdi.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.890
So this is a very, very holy place

00:04:49.091 --> 00:04:54.059
and a place of great worship

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.049
where many a times the Goddess was
worshipped.

00:04:57.256 --> 00:04:59.326
Rahuri itself, if you go round,

00:04:59.527 --> 00:05:02.749
you’ll find there are nine deities sitting
there.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:07.525
These are also created by Mother Earth.
They are beautiful things.

00:05:07.725 --> 00:05:09.677
No one knows about them. You can go and
have a look.

00:05:09.878 --> 00:05:17.495
There are nine of them and these represent
the nine incarnations of the Goddess,

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:23.173
or nine styles of the Goddess.

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:29.464
Now, in this beautiful place we are here,

00:05:29.665 --> 00:05:34.229
though it is spoiled by many things, but,
as you can see,

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.247
it’s very comfortable for our Spirit to be
here.

00:05:39.448 --> 00:05:47.096
At this place I have seen a negativity,
kind of a thing, was working out

00:05:47.297 --> 00:05:50.126
about [which] I want to tell you today
again.

00:05:50.327 --> 00:05:55.348
That works out everywhere wherever there is
a leadership of a person.

00:05:55.549 --> 00:05:59.311
Here Mr. Dhumal came and he got his
Realisation,

00:05:59.512 --> 00:06:05.981
in Bombay, at my residence. And he came
back [and] he started working it out here.

00:06:06.182 --> 00:06:10.255
His brother brought him, but his brother
became quite negative to begin with,

00:06:10.464 --> 00:06:12.393
and then the negativity started working out

00:06:12.593 --> 00:06:15.111
and people started opposing him and
troubling him

00:06:15.311 --> 00:06:19.256
and I had to go through a very difficult
period during that time.

00:06:19.457 --> 00:06:22.555
So now, as you are travelling, I want
to tell you:

00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:24.731
don’t challenge your leaders.

00:06:24.932 --> 00:06:29.091
Because not only that it disturbs the whole
organisation,

00:06:29.292 --> 00:06:34.422
but it gives me a physical manifestation;
I suffer physically.

00:06:34.623 --> 00:06:37.479
Specially if you come and say things
against the leader

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.783
in my presence I feel even worse.

00:06:40.984 --> 00:06:44.440
And once it happened that somebody was
talking about a leader

00:06:44.641 --> 00:06:47.177
and the whole of my back became so red

00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:54.649
that lots of blisters came out, I suffered
a lot.

00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:58.246
So I beg of you not to decide about
the leaders

00:06:58.447 --> 00:07:03.412
and don’t try to criticise them and take up
the ego position

00:07:03.613 --> 00:07:07.692
and try to see that, “He’s like this, he’s
hot tempered” or “He is this, that.”

00:07:07.893 --> 00:07:10.612
They have to be hot tempered! Because
I’m not.

00:07:10.813 --> 00:07:14.403
Because I cannot be very angry, they have
to protect me.

00:07:14.604 --> 00:07:18.192
As my protection, they have to be
hot-tempered and they have to tell you off.

00:07:18.393 --> 00:07:20.238
And if they tell off, then you should not
feel

00:07:20.438 --> 00:07:23.894
that they are bossy or they are doing these
things and all that.

00:07:24.095 --> 00:07:26.431
Actually those people who are bossy only
feel it,

00:07:26.632 --> 00:07:29.314
because they can’t bear that others can
tell them anything.

00:07:29.515 --> 00:07:34.067
So they think that others are bossy and
they are fine: that’s not so.

00:07:34.268 --> 00:07:36.610
So the trouble is that one should
understand

00:07:36.811 --> 00:07:40.708
that one has to work in this fashion.
I know what the leaders are.

00:07:40.909 --> 00:07:44.555
When I find the leaders are going wrong,
immediately I try to correct them.

00:07:44.756 --> 00:07:46.821
But you should not try to challenge
the leaders.

00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:52.501
But this is the greatest problem I had
in the West

00:07:52.702 --> 00:07:56.624
and later on I found here also, in India,
it used to brew up.

00:07:56.825 --> 00:08:00.248
Whenever I went away, then it started off:
the leader was challenged.

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:04.530
As if I don’t know about the leaders, as if
I don’t know anything about them,

00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:09.649
as if I am to be told, as if I am
absolutely ignorant.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.492
So you don’t have to worry. You shouldn’t
worry about it.

00:08:12.692 --> 00:08:15.947
I will tell you who is the leader and how
to work it out.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:18.803
It sometimes, of course, happens that
the leaders go off.

00:08:19.004 --> 00:08:22.520
I know that they go off. It happens that
they fall a trap

00:08:22.721 --> 00:08:24.951
to a wrong person. It’s quite possible;

00:08:25.152 --> 00:08:27.983
after all they have become leaders just
like you,

00:08:28.184 --> 00:08:29.917
with my special permission.

00:08:30.118 --> 00:08:32.376
But could be such a situation can come up

00:08:32.577 --> 00:08:34.898
and I want to then correct them and I
always tell them that,

00:08:35.098 --> 00:08:37.820
“This is a wrong thing you have done.
This is to be corrected.”

00:08:38.021 --> 00:08:41.419
But otherwise the whole administration
of Sahaja Yoga is impossible.

00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:43.613
It has to work through the leaders.

00:08:43.814 --> 00:08:46.831
You shouldn’t see how they talk, what they
say to you,

00:08:47.032 --> 00:08:49.124
what they work out, but do what they tell
you.

00:08:49.325 --> 00:08:51.535
There is no freedom lost in that.

00:08:51.735 --> 00:08:53.990
You will see that your freedom will be
maintained,

00:08:54.190 --> 00:08:56.289
respected and will be done.

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.623
On the contrary, I will say, when there is
a sloppy and a mild leadership

00:09:02.832 --> 00:09:05.843
it’s just impossible. Everybody else
becomes the leader.

00:09:06.043 --> 00:09:09.329
Like England, we can say, that Gavin was
very, very mild

00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:11.531
and now there are so many leaders who
come up,

00:09:11.732 --> 00:09:13.533
talk big, “Do this! Do that!”

00:09:13.734 --> 00:09:18.323
I’m having a big problem in England of so
many mushroom-like egos coming up.

00:09:18.524 --> 00:09:22.611
And they become so flippant and
nonsensical, and they talk all nonsense,

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:24.166
they start giving lectures, this, that.

00:09:24.366 --> 00:09:26.786
It’s impossible then to control.

00:09:26.993 --> 00:09:29.391
If Gavin was a strong fellow he would have
put them right.

00:09:29.592 --> 00:09:32.109
But he’s too good and too much of
a gentleman, I think.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:35.320
That much of gentlemanliness is of no use
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.845
So if he had handled the whole situation,

00:09:39.046 --> 00:09:41.908
with that thing is all right, and would
have worked out very well.

00:09:42.109 --> 00:09:46.599
But sometimes also the leader is told
to shut up, “You shut up!”

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:48.183
And like that he goes on shutting up.

00:09:48.383 --> 00:09:51.312
Everybody joins hands and shuts up
the leader

00:09:51.513 --> 00:09:56.082
and the leader becomes absolutely
a cabbage — he doesn’t say anything.

00:09:56.283 --> 00:09:59.290
So this is also a very bad habit is to say,
“Shut up! Don’t say anything!”

00:09:59.491 --> 00:10:01.709
I don’t like it. If somebody is talking
to me,

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:05.957
you shouldn’t just in front of me say,
“Shut up!” to that person

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:08.480
or pull his hand, or just punch him;

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:10.876
I don’t like all that, at all. That hurts
me.

00:10:11.084 --> 00:10:12.897
You should never do like that. I have seen
people

00:10:13.098 --> 00:10:15.700
have a this very bad habit, “Don’t say!”
“Don’t talk!”

00:10:15.901 --> 00:10:19.671
As if they are the greatest, wisest people
ever born to say such a thing:

00:10:19.872 --> 00:10:22.461
is a very wrong idea and this should not
be done.

00:10:22.669 --> 00:10:24.949
This should never be done in my presence,
I don’t like it,

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:29.635
it hurts me, and physically it manifests.

00:10:29.836 --> 00:10:33.024
So don’t do like this, don’t say anything,
don’t do it! I know how to handle it.

00:10:33.225 --> 00:10:36.491
If somebody is very funny I can tell that
person, “Now stop it!”

00:10:36.692 --> 00:10:41.434
I can do it. But you just don’t try to take
over things like that.

00:10:41.635 --> 00:10:44.176
Of course the leaders can do it,

00:10:44.377 --> 00:10:47.347
leaders, the ones who are grown up,
matured people,

00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:49.581
can just tell them to keep quiet.

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:52.869
But all the time some people have the habit
of saying, “No!” and “No!”

00:10:53.070 --> 00:10:55.593
It’s bhootish, I would say. It’s really
bhootish.

00:10:55.794 --> 00:10:58.606
Because they never allow me to see
the reality.

00:10:58.807 --> 00:11:02.621
We must know what’s happening, what people
have to say. I should know about it.

00:11:02.822 --> 00:11:06.912
There’s nothing wrong in it. But on
the contrary, they come and tell me,

00:11:07.113 --> 00:11:09.734
“Our leader is like that, our leader is
like that.”

00:11:09.935 --> 00:11:14.052
That you don’t worry because my attention
is most on your leaders.

00:11:14.253 --> 00:11:17.815
I do change leaders and I will change
leaders in case they are wrong.

00:11:18.016 --> 00:11:21.892
But let me decide. That decision you leave
it to me.

00:11:22.093 --> 00:11:24.111
So this is another point I wanted to say
about Rahuri,

00:11:24.312 --> 00:11:27.863
which I learnt a lesson here. Then another
thing I found out:

00:11:28.064 --> 00:11:32.639
The villagers here are much more easily
convinced,

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:35.105
they take to Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:11:35.306 --> 00:11:38.606
And while the educated take time to take
to Sahaja Yoga;

00:11:38.807 --> 00:11:41.541
naturally because they think they are very
well educated!

00:11:41.742 --> 00:11:44.163
And they find it difficult to forget their
education

00:11:44.364 --> 00:11:48.129
and become simpler people. So in the same
way, you will find the simple people

00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:51.978
will take to Sahaja Yoga much faster than
the people who are educated;

00:11:52.179 --> 00:11:56.641
because their mind works too fast, they
cannot catch the vibrations.

00:11:56.842 --> 00:11:59.320
The mind is running fast, the vibrations
are running after them

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:04.075
and it’s a big game of hide and seek going
on! But doesn’t matter.

00:12:04.276 --> 00:12:09.307
Still, once that intelligent get to Sahaja
Yoga, then it works even wonders.

00:12:09.508 --> 00:12:12.520
Once they get to it, they take time, no
doubt. They take time,

00:12:12.721 --> 00:12:15.940
but once they take, get to it then it works
wonders.

00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:21.049
So some people take [to] it easily, but
they don’t work out that well;

00:12:21.249 --> 00:12:24.833
those who take with difficulty, work out
better;

00:12:25.033 --> 00:12:28.576
in the sense that they can intelligently
manifest it

00:12:28.776 --> 00:12:32.207
and talk to people and tell them about it.

00:12:32.408 --> 00:12:34.547
So this is another thing one has to
remember that:

00:12:34.748 --> 00:12:38.679
try to understand that through your
education you have not known anything.

00:12:38.879 --> 00:12:41.515
Because you never felt vibrations, you did
not even know

00:12:41.716 --> 00:12:43.835
that there was something like that
existing!

00:12:44.043 --> 00:12:46.193
This is a new knowledge, absolutely
a new thing.

00:12:46.394 --> 00:12:48.540
Absolutely it has nothing to do with your
degrees,

00:12:48.740 --> 00:12:51.529
M.A.D. and Ph.D.s and all those things.

00:12:51.729 --> 00:12:55.265
It is something else that is existing,
which you have to feel.

00:12:55.466 --> 00:13:00.486
So if you take that simple attitude it
would be a better idea.

00:13:00.687 --> 00:13:10.043
Now the fourth thing which upsets me is
grouping, to form a group.

00:13:10.244 --> 00:13:13.101
That’s another very upsetting thing is
to form a group.

00:13:13.302 --> 00:13:17.988
This is one group of this place or group
of that place: who belongs to this place.

00:13:18.189 --> 00:13:22.756
And this grouping, once it takes place
there is a gap in the collective.

00:13:22.957 --> 00:13:27.324
When there’s a grouping, say, a nose and
eyes they become one group;

00:13:27.525 --> 00:13:29.765
then there’s a gap between them and
the hands.

00:13:29.965 --> 00:13:33.941
So if there’s a problem in the nose,
the hands will not act.

00:13:34.142 --> 00:13:38.528
So the whole activity becomes
a disintegrated activity.

00:13:38.729 --> 00:13:40.291
So one should never form a group.

00:13:40.492 --> 00:13:44.770
Those who have a habit of forming a group
must be completely discouraged.

00:13:44.971 --> 00:13:49.239
They start saying against somebody, then
against that one, then this that,

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.020
then they form a group, the one group goes
there, one group.

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:55.474
So grouping is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga,
it is malignancy.

00:13:55.697 --> 00:13:59.533
It is malignancy. If it starts working out,
you become malignant.

00:13:59.734 --> 00:14:03.494
The whole group becomes malignant and
it’s a very difficult problem then

00:14:03.695 --> 00:14:06.618
to put them right.

00:14:06.819 --> 00:14:13.657
And one should not accept any sort of
a sloppy or a very mild leadership also.

00:14:13.858 --> 00:14:16.633
One should accept a strong,

00:14:16.833 --> 00:14:20.141
fierce, I would say, to some extent,
leadership. That will help.

00:14:20.342 --> 00:14:24.425
Because our ideas are very different from
what you have had so far,

00:14:24.626 --> 00:14:28.402
“The leader should be pleasing to us. He
should have a personality

00:14:28.603 --> 00:14:31.972
that will be extremely lovey-dovey type.”
That’s not so.

00:14:32.173 --> 00:14:35.493
The leader has to be a strong, fierce
personality

00:14:35.694 --> 00:14:39.154
that should make people respect him and
have awe for him.

00:14:39.355 --> 00:14:41.903
But because we are so free we can pass
remarks

00:14:42.104 --> 00:14:45.218
about the leader and say, “This leader
is bad, that leader is bad.”

00:14:45.418 --> 00:14:48.210
But it’s not a good thing! It doesn’t help.
It doesn’t help.

00:14:48.411 --> 00:14:52.343
On the contrary, as I told you, the sloppy
people create horrible problems!

00:14:52.544 --> 00:14:56.651
And then you get so many egoistical people
who come up.

00:14:56.851 --> 00:14:59.500
I mean a sloppy person, if there’s one
sloppy person,

00:14:59.701 --> 00:15:04.259
or who has accepted such a domination,
if he is there as a leader,

00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:07.646
all the rest of the people, those who come
in contact

00:15:07.846 --> 00:15:10.243
with that person, also become ego-oriented.

00:15:10.444 --> 00:15:13.330
They also start behaving in such a manner
that you can’t imagine.

00:15:13.530 --> 00:15:17.366
Like Gavin’s is a very good example:

00:15:17.566 --> 00:15:20.982
in his office he had arranged work for
some people.

00:15:21.183 --> 00:15:24.538
Everyone who worked in his office got
into this trouble,

00:15:24.739 --> 00:15:27.998
because he was so good that they picked up
their ego, you see,

00:15:28.199 --> 00:15:31.896
because the superego was there,

00:15:32.097 --> 00:15:35.623
so they thought better to use your ego and
that’s how the whole thing worked out.

00:15:35.823 --> 00:15:39.728
Poor fellow had to ask all of them to get
out of the office.

00:15:39.929 --> 00:15:43.215
So this is an example for us and there’s
nothing to feel

00:15:43.415 --> 00:15:47.504
that it is any criticism of anything.

00:15:47.705 --> 00:15:50.270
But it doesn’t work out, this system
doesn’t work out.

00:15:50.471 --> 00:15:59.557
So you should not try to make an effort
that you criticise them.

00:15:59.758 --> 00:16:02.086
Now, another thing about leadership I have
to tell you

00:16:02.286 --> 00:16:05.141
[is] that supposing I have appointed
Christine as a leader.

00:16:05.342 --> 00:16:08.093
She is the leader of North America:

00:16:08.294 --> 00:16:11.568
then she has to take the decisions for
North America.

00:16:11.768 --> 00:16:14.762
But nobody else, not even her husband
should take any decisions.

00:16:14.962 --> 00:16:18.264
He should not. He should have nothing
to do. He should be in the background.

00:16:18.465 --> 00:16:22.087
Whosoever is the leader should deal with
the problem.

00:16:22.288 --> 00:16:25.790
This is the trouble is, if the wife is
there, then the husband takes over,

00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.682
husband gets, then the wife. Like I should
say Poona,

00:16:28.883 --> 00:16:31.590
Poona, I appointed somebody there, he was
shut down

00:16:31.791 --> 00:16:33.989
and his wife took over; and the wife is
a horrid stuff.

00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:36.514
I mean, I don’t know what to do with
such things.

00:16:36.715 --> 00:16:39.748
It is very difficult that, if it’s
a husband, it’s a husband,

00:16:39.948 --> 00:16:42.953
it’s a wife, it’s a wife. Then the wife
becomes little dominating,

00:16:43.154 --> 00:16:46.257
the husband comes back and then the husband
starts ruling.

00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:49.469
Then my attention is on the wife, here
the husband becomes…

00:16:49.669 --> 00:16:52.512
In leadership there is nothing like husband
and wife. They have nothing to do.

00:16:52.713 --> 00:16:55.422
Whosoever is the leader is to be accepted
as the leader,

00:16:55.622 --> 00:16:57.774
whether he is the husband or the wife.
This is one thing:

00:16:57.974 --> 00:17:01.529
in Sahaja Yoga there is no discrimination
between women and men.

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:04.376
Not that the men should always rule nor
the women should rule.

00:17:04.577 --> 00:17:07.647
It is whosoever is appointed as the leader
is the leader.

00:17:07.848 --> 00:17:10.677
I must tell you these things because these
little, little things

00:17:10.877 --> 00:17:13.637
make such a difference to the whole
organisation

00:17:13.838 --> 00:17:17.158
that I don’t know how to tell. Because
husband has no right as a leader.

00:17:17.359 --> 00:17:21.458
He’s not appointed as a leader, so he has
no right as a leader.

00:17:21.659 --> 00:17:25.742
If you all understand this point that
leadership is very important part.

00:17:25.943 --> 00:17:29.699
It’s like the main organ of the body.

00:17:30.001 --> 00:17:33.611
And that leadership should not be
challenged at any cost, any time.

00:17:33.812 --> 00:17:36.730
Like Dr. Sanghvi is the leader of Nasik.

00:17:36.930 --> 00:17:39.233
So he is the leader. He has to do it.

00:17:39.434 --> 00:17:44.554
It is he who decides, it is he who says.
Nobody should challenge it [him].

00:17:44.755 --> 00:17:48.232
So we have got leaders of different places,
if you have any problems

00:17:48.432 --> 00:17:51.153
about deciding who is the leader, you come
and ask me.

00:17:51.354 --> 00:17:55.310
I always appoint one person. In Italy,
Gregoire, I don’t know why,

00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:58.168
he said there should be two persons.
I don’t know why he said two.

00:17:58.369 --> 00:18:00.109
But I told him, “Gregoire, it’s not a wrong
thing,”

00:18:00.309 --> 00:18:01.981
but he just said, “No. You must have.”

00:18:02.182 --> 00:18:06.375
And the second one was dropped out so
badly, I mean he really harmed us.

00:18:06.576 --> 00:18:08.903
So just listen to me! I know, I understand.

00:18:09.104 --> 00:18:11.835
Guido can say that, what has happened
in Italy,

00:18:12.036 --> 00:18:13.733
is because they didn’t listen to me.

00:18:13.934 --> 00:18:16.182
Here we are not to please everyone.

00:18:16.382 --> 00:18:19.739
No, we are not here to take any voting
or anything.

00:18:19.940 --> 00:18:22.237
We are here to do the job, and for doing
the job

00:18:22.437 --> 00:18:25.041
we must take the right course, right
methods.

00:18:25.241 --> 00:18:27.611
So those who think, “Oh, have three
of them then!”

00:18:27.812 --> 00:18:29.845
Then, “Have five of them!” This is
nonsense!

00:18:30.046 --> 00:18:33.608
For what? Just to pamper ego?

00:18:33.809 --> 00:18:36.100
Any leader is as good as you people are,

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:38.914
[the] only difference is my attention is
on that leader.

00:18:39.115 --> 00:18:40.884
That’s why it works out better.

00:18:41.084 --> 00:18:42.844
Don’t allow your ego to dominate you.

00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:45.513
There’s nothing… What does he do? Poor
man, the leader now?

00:18:45.714 --> 00:18:50.080
For example, I would say, Warren: he worked
so hard, he really laboured through.

00:18:50.281 --> 00:18:52.770
And he worked so hard he got so sick.
I was wondering.

00:18:52.971 --> 00:18:57.146
It’s all right for me. I am after all
a Adi Shakti,

00:18:57.346 --> 00:19:01.660
so it doesn’t matter I can be, I can be
a marathon.

00:19:01.861 --> 00:19:05.611
But this fellow was working with me. I knew
he’ll have to give way at a point.

00:19:05.812 --> 00:19:10.588
It’s too much. And then people start
criticising Warren, I can’t understand.

00:19:10.789 --> 00:19:14.497
I mean, he is working day in and day out.
Can’t they see this?

00:19:14.698 --> 00:19:18.500
Without him what would have happened
to us?

00:19:18.727 --> 00:19:21.613
I mean, those who are leaders work so hard,
they do so much

00:19:21.813 --> 00:19:24.107
and then you start criticising. That’s not
proper.

00:19:24.308 --> 00:19:27.659
That’s being a bit ingratitude towards
them and towards me.

00:19:27.859 --> 00:19:32.076
On the contrary, I feel so much obliged
to them. After all this is my job.

00:19:32.276 --> 00:19:35.513
This is I am paid for it, I can say.

00:19:35.714 --> 00:19:38.979
So I am doing this job, all right. But what
about them?

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:42.766
They are human beings, they have got their
other things.

00:19:42.967 --> 00:19:45.829
I don’t have to earn money, I don’t have
any problems.

00:19:46.044 --> 00:19:47.760
So why? Why bother them?

00:19:47.961 --> 00:19:51.190
They are the ones who have dedicated
their lives doing so much,

00:19:51.391 --> 00:19:53.829
and then you start criticising them.
It is impossible.

00:19:54.030 --> 00:19:57.380
But if he says anything to you, “Don’t do
this, and don’t do that!”

00:19:57.581 --> 00:20:00.716
And sometimes it is with my consultation
he does it.

00:20:00.917 --> 00:20:04.560
Which things I cannot say directly, he
might say indirectly to you.

00:20:04.761 --> 00:20:06.493
So you shouldn’t challenge such things.

00:20:06.694 --> 00:20:09.528
This is one of the things today I wanted
to talk, about leadership,

00:20:09.728 --> 00:20:15.111
because this is a place where I have faced
some problems of leadership.

00:20:16.034 --> 00:20:21.508
And one should understand that this is the
only way Sahaja Yoga is going to work out.

00:20:21.709 --> 00:20:25.978
In the body also, as you know, it is not
that the heart,

00:20:26.179 --> 00:20:29.620
which is the heart, is the complete pumping
source.

00:20:29.821 --> 00:20:32.012
Now the heart’s work is to be accepted:

00:20:32.212 --> 00:20:35.472
that it is this pumping source, and it
gives to all the other organs.

00:20:35.673 --> 00:20:38.002
So liver is liver, brain is brain.

00:20:38.203 --> 00:20:39.529
Brain doesn’t want to become the heart,

00:20:39.729 --> 00:20:41.236
heart doesn’t want to become the liver.

00:20:41.437 --> 00:20:46.657
Now the liver cells, if they say that, “Now
we will work for the heart!”

00:20:46.858 --> 00:20:51.136
or “We’ll form a group!” then how can you
do it?

00:20:51.955 --> 00:20:54.459
So as we have got very important organs,

00:20:54.659 --> 00:20:57.958
we have got very important leaders. And
I know what they are up to,

00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:01.481
I know what’s wrong with them, so you leave
it to me to correct them.

00:21:01.685 --> 00:21:03.768
All right, this is for the foreigners
today.

00:21:03.968 --> 00:21:06.833
Because now we’ll be moving further and
further

00:21:07.034 --> 00:21:09.795
into more difficult time, I think, because
there may be

00:21:09.996 --> 00:21:13.294
little spartan living for you because you
asked for it!

00:21:13.495 --> 00:21:17.392
You wanted to have a camping ground, so I
have arranged a camping ground for you.

00:21:17.593 --> 00:21:19.802
So then you should not say [about]
the leader,

00:21:20.002 --> 00:21:22.923
“Where is he? Now call him! What have
you done?”

00:21:23.123 --> 00:21:27.472
It’s all arranged by me, so don’t blame
him. And enjoy yourself.

00:21:27.673 --> 00:21:30.726
And don’t try to say that it’s he who
should have looked after:

00:21:30.927 --> 00:21:33.436
he’s not paid for it. He’s not paid for it.

00:21:33.637 --> 00:21:35.706
I am paid for it. They are not.

00:21:35.907 --> 00:21:40.052
In the sense [that] I am paid because I am
made for that.

00:21:40.253 --> 00:21:43.056
It’s my job. I am doing it because I have
to do it.

00:21:43.257 --> 00:21:47.555
I cannot do anything else but to do this
job, otherwise I won’t exist, you see.

00:21:47.755 --> 00:21:50.788
So mine is a different point. But if he’s
doing it,

00:21:50.989 --> 00:21:53.665
then it is an obligation on me. And in
a way I feel,

00:21:53.866 --> 00:21:56.048
and you all should feel, also, obliged.

00:21:56.249 --> 00:21:59.051
May God bless you all.

00:21:59.588 --> 00:22:04.503
[Marathi Talk for 10 minutes, the
Shri Mataji talks again in English]

00:31:52.652 --> 00:31:56.141
A saint will never criticize another saint.
Is never done.

00:31:56.341 --> 00:31:58.766
Saint will always appreciate another saint.

00:31:58.967 --> 00:32:01.565
And also a devil will, no doubt.

00:32:01.766 --> 00:32:07.916
But if you are neither a devil nor a saint,
then you start criticizing each other.

00:32:08.416 --> 00:32:10.156
So don’t criticize each other.

00:32:10.356 --> 00:32:14.647
You are all saints of a very high quality,
don’t criticize each other.

00:32:14.848 --> 00:32:16.788
See for yourself what’s wrong with you,

00:32:16.988 --> 00:32:19.655
why are you seeing all the bad points
of another person?

00:32:19.856 --> 00:32:25.264
Why don’t you see your bad points? It’s
an obtuse angles.

00:32:25.465 --> 00:32:28.346
You see, with an obtuse angle if you are
looking at people, you see,

00:32:28.547 --> 00:32:32.668
then you see things which do not exist,
which are not good for you.

00:32:32.869 --> 00:32:34.799
So develop a kind of a sensitivity

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.744
by which you see your own problems and
not others’.

00:32:37.945 --> 00:32:41.062
If you start finding faults with others,
immediately put back to yourself:

00:32:41.263 --> 00:32:44.629
“Why? What’s wrong with me?”.

00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:47.667
If somebody you call your leader, or
anybody a bossy person,

00:32:47.876 --> 00:32:52.506
see: are you a bossy person yourself?
You must be.

00:32:53.928 --> 00:32:57.752
Then it will be all right. Because it is in
Sahaja Yoga there is nothing hidden,

00:32:57.952 --> 00:33:01.394
nothing kept secret, everybody knows
about everyone.

00:33:01.595 --> 00:33:04.289
Because whatever I may say today, tomorrow
you’ll be so changed

00:33:04.489 --> 00:33:10.164
I will not even be able to recognize you.
It is going to be so much difficult

00:33:10.365 --> 00:33:12.967
to recognize you, because you are growing
so fast.

00:33:13.168 --> 00:33:17.059
So keep to the growth, keep to the growth.

00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:21.562
Thank you very much. It is so that today
the puja had to start late,

00:33:21.762 --> 00:33:24.885
because you know, there are certain things…

00:33:25.086 --> 00:33:27.417
I just blame other things which nothing
is there,

00:33:27.618 --> 00:33:31.643
you cannot blame anyone, that has to be,
that has to be.

00:33:31.868 --> 00:33:33.441
I was born at 12 o’clock, you see,

00:33:33.641 --> 00:33:38.214
so to start puja before that is something
out of place.

00:33:38.415 --> 00:33:40.648
And I have to wait till twelve to pass out
nicely,

00:33:40.848 --> 00:33:45.900
so that I should try and awake myself

00:33:46.331 --> 00:33:50.579
to my responsibility and all the deities
must be awakened.

00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:53.143
You see, they have their own style and
their own timings

00:33:53.344 --> 00:33:56.969
and I cannot force them to do what I want
to do or [what] you want to do.

00:33:57.170 --> 00:34:03.557
It’s another style. They are so bound, that
I cannot force them anything.

00:34:03.758 --> 00:34:06.979
You also should know my helplessness
about it.

00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:10.215
Thank you very much.

00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:07.916
After the puja you must mix up with these
people,

00:35:08.116 --> 00:35:10.773
ask their names, talk to them, who they
are –

00:35:10.974 --> 00:35:15.454
you must meet your brothers and sisters
from Rahuri.

00:44:08.435 --> 00:44:12.046
Shri Mataji: Vibrations…

00:45:47.337 --> 00:45:49.191
Shri Mataji: Take a bandhan. It’s a good
idea.

00:45:49.398 --> 00:45:52.208
See, we have to be serious about it. We
must understand.

00:45:52.409 --> 00:45:55.831
We are saints, and we should take it up
everything seriously.

00:45:56.031 --> 00:45:59.213
It’s a tremendous task.

01:24:27.901 --> 01:24:31.007
This is the Kunjika stotra, you see, bija
mantras, you see,

01:24:31.208 --> 01:24:36.379
is the fundamental mantras are in Kunjika
stotra.

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:41.007
In this Kunjika stotra the bija mantras,

01:24:41.207 --> 01:24:45.581
means the seed, the seed of the mantras
are there,

01:24:45.782 --> 01:24:50.164
and actually the Kunjika stotra is actually
Kundalini awakening mantra;

01:24:50.364 --> 01:24:54.250
that’s what you all should remember
by heart. Kunjika.

01:24:54.450 --> 01:24:57.957
The last one he said it. That’s Kunji,

01:24:58.158 --> 01:25:05.700
Kunji means, Kunjika means a key.
It’s the key, key mantra.

01:32:27.209 --> 01:32:29.775
Shri Mataji: There are only three jatis,
three castes.

01:32:29.975 --> 01:32:35.304
Because he said the Mother exists as jatis,

01:32:35.505 --> 01:32:39.160
Mother exists as the castes.

01:32:39.368 --> 01:32:43.744
Now, the Mother exists only as
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati,

01:32:43.944 --> 01:32:47.379
so She has only three castes.

01:32:47.580 --> 01:32:53.403
One is the caste of the tamasikas,
rajasikas and sattvikas.

01:32:53.604 --> 01:32:59.036
And the fourth one are sahaja yogis which
are Adi Shakti’s children.

01:32:59.963 --> 01:33:03.532
So, how can we have caste system?

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.841
Shri Mataji: Double, double, double it.

01:38:21.723 --> 01:38:24.636
Yogi: O Goddess, You are always giving
the auspiciousness.

01:38:24.837 --> 01:38:28.298
Every time we remember our Ma please
come to our rescue every time.

01:38:28.499 --> 01:38:31.469
Shri Mataji: Very nice.

01:38:40.930 --> 01:38:44.843
These are the gods, you see, praising.

01:58:30.475 --> 01:58:35.284
You can come forward. You can stand up.

01:59:06.767 --> 01:59:13.729
You stand up now… take the photograph
and go.

02:06:33.864 --> 02:06:39.778
Today I have not taken to any mudra, in
the sense that of blessings and things,

02:06:39.979 --> 02:06:47.195
because now for whatever I was doing it,
was to establish a universal religion.

02:06:47.396 --> 02:06:52.463
Now, as we have established it, now I need
not do the mudras.

02:06:52.664 --> 02:06:55.076
Thank you.

02:06:55.942 --> 02:06:59.033
Did you follow the word mudra?

02:06:59.233 --> 02:07:01.886
The way I used to use my hands this way
and that way.

02:07:02.086 --> 02:07:05.643
There is no need now to use.

02:20:43.876 --> 02:20:48.660
You have made a nice crown.

02:20:48.861 --> 02:20:53.878
You have made a nice crown for
the Americans, for Shri Krishna Puja.

02:20:54.092 --> 02:20:56.736
With the Americans – One of them come
forward,

02:20:56.937 --> 02:21:00.346
to take the Shri Krishna puja crown.

02:21:03.969 --> 02:21:07.405
They have made it with their own hands.

02:21:11.674 --> 02:21:14.840
Let some American come forward.

02:21:22.226 --> 02:21:26.700
Everybody wants Americans now to come
forward,

02:21:26.901 --> 02:21:30.140
and to attain their realization.

02:21:30.373 --> 02:21:32.997
May God bless you.

02:21:49.820 --> 02:21:54.263
This crown is made by Dhumal’s daughter.

02:22:45.394 --> 02:22:47.975
All right…

02:22:51.975 --> 02:22:55.456
This is for Dhumal.

02:24:32.406 --> 02:24:38.184
You all have to get up and go for your
lunch from the back.

02:25:06.525 --> 02:25:10.025
Yes, just before going…

02:25:42.294 --> 02:25:48.167
They have decided to give to every country
a photograph of mine

02:25:48.368 --> 02:25:50.690
from Rahuri, which is in black and white,

02:25:50.891 --> 02:25:55.311
and which is very good for taking out
badhas.

02:25:59.319 --> 02:26:01.969
And this is about twelve years back,

02:26:02.170 --> 02:26:04.860
the first Puja we have had here, twelve
years.

02:26:05.060 --> 02:26:09.652
Today twelve years I have completed,
in Rahuri.

02:26:14.137 --> 02:26:17.383
But twelve years is equal to one parva,
is a very big thing.

02:26:17.584 --> 02:26:24.198
All right. First I’ll show you
the photograph.

02:26:30.850 --> 02:26:34.734
Name of the country.

02:26:35.114 --> 02:26:40.156
(Country representatives are called to collect
the photograph: Australia, New Zealand)

02:26:50.901 --> 02:26:53.640
Brian, Brian.

02:27:14.164 --> 02:27:17.849
You look nice in a dhoti.

02:27:18.906 --> 02:27:23.502
(Then Switzerland, France, Austria,

02:27:23.709 --> 02:27:29.028
Germany, Italy, Spain, Malaysia, UK,

02:27:29.259 --> 02:27:32.052
Belgium, USA, Canada, South America
and others)

02:29:00.712 --> 02:29:04.135
May God bless you.

02:29:11.662 --> 02:29:14.837
May God bless you.

02:29:27.663 --> 02:29:32.783
Some of the photographs have got
vibrations behind.

02:29:58.060 --> 02:30:01.163
May God bless you.

02:30:36.076 --> 02:30:39.116
May God bless you.

02:31:16.953 --> 02:31:21.881
So, I think we have to vacate the place,
for service of food.

02:31:22.082 --> 02:31:26.137
So you all have to vacate it for a while.

02:31:26.570 --> 02:31:30.627
If you can get up and go out, then they
will start serving here.
