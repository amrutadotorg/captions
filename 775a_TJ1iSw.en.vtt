00:13.769 --> 00:23.550
In one of My lectures, I talked to you
about the emotional intelligence.

00:24.274 --> 00:27.449
That is what we should try to imbibe.

00:27.650 --> 00:37.086
Emotional intelligence, that means
the intelligence that is based on emotions.

00:37.888 --> 00:41.166
Unless and until we become emotionally
intelligent,

00:41.367 --> 00:44.510
our society cannot improve.

00:44.711 --> 00:52.495
In an emotional intelligence, you care
and you enjoy caring.

00:52.696 --> 01:01.729
You do everything for others with a great
emotional understanding.

01:01.930 --> 01:04.953
Not for one child, not for one son,

01:05.154 --> 01:12.034
but for everyone you have to be
emotionally intelligent.

01:12.235 --> 01:16.253
Some children are born like this, but some
are to be made like that,

01:16.454 --> 01:21.192
that they should be emotionally
intelligent.

01:21.393 --> 01:28.841
Because, if the mother and father are
money-oriented, very selfish,

01:29.042 --> 01:34.989
they wouldn’t allow their child to give
anything to others.

01:35.190 --> 01:40.503
So such a child will grow into a very
funny type of a person

01:40.704 --> 01:45.573
and will never do anything for anybody,
not even for his own country.

01:45.774 --> 01:50.565
Why should he do it? Everything
for selfishness.

01:50.766 --> 01:57.253
Then such people indulge into corruption,
indulge into all kinds of things,

01:57.454 --> 02:02.787
which are only selfish in attitude.

02:02.988 --> 02:06.130
Now we are talking of collectivity.

02:06.331 --> 02:13.520
In collectivity, we do for others.
We enjoy doing for others.

02:13.740 --> 02:17.677
We love giving things to others, not
for yourself,

02:17.878 --> 02:21.508
because your children will also become
the same kind

02:21.709 --> 02:25.935
and they will only bother about themselves.

02:26.889 --> 02:31.797
This emotional intelligence has to be
brought in our life.

02:31.998 --> 02:37.865
In our pattern that we have, are we
emotionally intelligent

02:38.066 --> 02:46.166
or we are just intelligent or emotional?
Both things are wrong.

02:46.367 --> 02:50.744
If you are just intelligent, you can become
very dry person.

02:50.945 --> 02:56.652
You may just have few friends maybe,
you may not have

02:56.853 --> 03:04.146
and you will always try to preserve
yourself away from the collectivity.

03:04.347 --> 03:09.758
And if you are emotional, you’ll be
attached only to one person,

03:09.959 --> 03:15.633
attached to one child, maybe, attached
to one person, to someone,

03:15.834 --> 03:19.958
even in the society. For no rhyme
or reason. Why?

03:20.159 --> 03:23.690
Why are you attached to one person?

03:24.271 --> 03:27.571
Why are you bothered about one person only?

03:27.772 --> 03:31.657
All such people fall into such terrible
prey.

03:31.858 --> 03:35.044
In the politics you have seen how people
try to help

03:35.245 --> 03:38.581
their own sons and own daughters and
this and that.

03:38.782 --> 03:46.542
And we Indians have suffered a lot with
this kind of an emotional attachment.

03:49.674 --> 04:02.262
So, according to ethics, emotional
intelligence is the highest quality,

04:02.712 --> 04:06.940
by which you give to others,

04:07.141 --> 04:12.229
you care for others, for everyone

04:12.437 --> 04:16.697
and you become very, very collective.

04:19.219 --> 04:26.410
Now exclusiveness is another fashion
that’s very miserable, it’s exclusive.

04:26.611 --> 04:32.627
Because you don’t want to be one of the
multitudes. You want to be exclusive.

04:32.828 --> 04:38.830
You should be exclusive in emotional
intelligence,

04:39.031 --> 04:44.338
not on other things. That is the best thing
you can have.

04:44.539 --> 04:49.815
As I agree, I am just a woman and just
a Mother,

04:50.000 --> 04:57.805
but what I have is really the emotional
intelligence, ocean of it,

04:58.006 --> 05:06.818
and from that I know about everyone,
I understand about everyone.

05:07.019 --> 05:12.436
And all this work has been done because
of that quality in My head.

05:12.637 --> 05:18.408
I’m not attached to one person or
to one style.

05:18.609 --> 05:22.665
Whatever you say, I can understand,

05:22.866 --> 05:29.484
because I am at a level where I can
understand everything that you are doing.

05:29.685 --> 05:35.562
To achieve that, you try to develop
emotional intelligence.

05:35.763 --> 05:41.500
Here the children won’t even give a toy
to somebody to play [with].

05:42.372 --> 05:47.609
Even the mother is like that, the father
is like that, extremely selfish

05:47.810 --> 05:52.927
and: “We must have our own, you see,
everything should be our own.”

05:53.128 --> 05:57.864
This has to go. This has to go, from
Americans especially,

05:58.065 --> 06:06.193
because they are the leading nation
in this kind of selfishness.

06:06.893 --> 06:11.079
What selfishness they have done, I need
not count, but you know that.

06:11.280 --> 06:17.688
You go and ask the people of Canada,
Mexico, Peru, all this, they will tell you.

06:17.889 --> 06:21.360
Being selfish, they are not ashamed.

06:21.561 --> 06:25.891
They are exploiters, they are not ashamed.

06:26.991 --> 06:33.352
Nobody can even tell them, because they
think they are very rich people.

06:33.553 --> 06:39.915
But all these riches will not give them
the joy of life.

06:40.116 --> 06:46.024
Joy of life is only in the emotional
intelligence.

06:46.225 --> 06:49.688
If you don’t have that, it becomes
very dry.

06:49.889 --> 06:53.704
Life becomes very odd, unbearable,
horrible

06:53.905 --> 06:59.110
and even the family gets broken up,

06:59.311 --> 07:03.173
if there is no emotional intelligence
in the family.

07:03.374 --> 07:05.816
I have known so many women

07:06.017 --> 07:10.239
who have had three marriages, five
marriages. I don’t know how they can do it.

07:10.440 --> 07:15.896
But they have done because of this lack
of emotional intelligence.

07:16.097 --> 07:21.859
It is something that is a sense of giving.

07:22.060 --> 07:25.711
It is not that you are sacrificing
anything, no!

07:25.912 --> 07:31.847
That’s also another idea, that we have
to bear this - nothing of the kind.

07:32.048 --> 07:36.118
Look at the life of Christ, He gave
His life. Why?

07:36.319 --> 07:41.949
What was the need for Him to do that?
Behind Him was the Truth.

07:42.150 --> 07:46.394
When you have the Truth with you, the light
of the Truth, the force of the Truth,

07:46.595 --> 07:53.292
the strength of the Truth, you become
emotionally intelligent.

07:53.493 --> 07:57.027
You understand that, if you really love
something,

07:57.228 --> 08:03.173
then you have to undergo every kind
of trouble.

08:03.374 --> 08:05.784
You have to tolerate lot of nonsense.

08:05.985 --> 08:10.542
I know it’s too much to say, but I thought
that, for this special Puja,

08:10.743 --> 08:16.738
I should say something about the family
life.

08:16.939 --> 08:23.183
In our ashrams or in our programs,
or wherever we are,

08:23.384 --> 08:31.235
we should remember this point, that:
“Are we having that emotional intelligence

08:31.436 --> 08:35.792
when we are trying to talk about
Sahaja Yoga?”

08:35.993 --> 08:39.046
Why do I need to be every place to tell
them?

08:39.247 --> 08:42.558
What is the need? You can tell them.

08:42.759 --> 08:49.113
If you have that emotional intelligence,
everybody will listen to you. Why not?

08:49.314 --> 08:52.599
Not necessarily I should go everywhere
and talk to them.

08:52.800 --> 08:55.513
How many countries can I visit?

08:55.714 --> 09:01.527
And the reaction to it is so beautiful and
so nice. It’s very surprising.

09:01.728 --> 09:05.856
Like in a country like Benin country,
all Muslims there,

09:06.057 --> 09:12.655
all black people, they all have become
Sahaja Yogis. Nine thousand people.

09:12.856 --> 09:16.996
How could I capture that? Just think
of that.

09:17.197 --> 09:23.611
Nine thousand people suddenly will come.
Then also other countries I have seen.

09:23.812 --> 09:27.660
Just this is the power of emotional
intelligence

09:27.822 --> 09:31.496
that captures the heart of the people.

09:31.721 --> 09:36.293
You may have any amount of property,
money, everything,

09:36.494 --> 09:41.287
people will abhor you. All right. So you
may say: “What’s wrong?”

09:41.488 --> 09:45.209
What’s wrong is this that you are harming

09:45.410 --> 09:53.099
the greatest thing, is the human being.

09:53.300 --> 09:56.996
And the politicians they are horrible,
as they say.

09:57.197 --> 10:01.371
Why? Because they have no emotional
intelligence.

10:01.572 --> 10:08.089
Also as administrators, they are very
much difficult,

10:08.290 --> 10:12.342
because they have no emotional
intelligence.

10:12.854 --> 10:20.724
All these people are devoid of that great
quality of emotional intelligence.

10:20.925 --> 10:24.292
If your country is very progressive,
I must say

10:24.493 --> 10:27.761
you must progress in emotional
intelligence.

10:27.962 --> 10:30.740
That way, they have philanthropists,
I know.

10:30.941 --> 10:33.365
Americans are known to be philanthropists.

10:33.566 --> 10:39.131
But behind that is they want to have
power.

10:40.308 --> 10:43.935
They want to rule people with that money.

10:44.136 --> 10:48.983
It’s not emotional intelligence, it’s they
just want to rule.

10:49.184 --> 10:52.998
If they start some sort of a charity,

10:53.199 --> 10:57.233
that is just to have a big name
on the television,

10:57.434 --> 11:03.061
or to have a very great advertisement
about, “Oh, he has...”

11:03.262 --> 11:07.608
and then he moves like a tycoon all over.

11:07.785 --> 11:13.146
Wee part of it they will donate, wee part
of their property, work it out

11:13.347 --> 11:18.503
and make such a fuss about it, because
they want to cash everything.

11:18.704 --> 11:21.792
Cash has been given, so cash everything.

11:21.993 --> 11:25.266
You are Sahaja Yogis.

11:25.467 --> 11:29.284
You have to send waves of emotional
intelligence.

11:29.485 --> 11:33.972
You have to send love to all over
the world.

11:34.173 --> 11:38.729
You have to show how you can, with love,
win over.

11:38.930 --> 11:43.226
It is also possible, if you are not so
attached.

11:43.427 --> 11:46.804
If you are attached, say to your
country only -

11:47.005 --> 11:52.881
now this is a bigger issue - then you will
try to exploit other countries,

11:53.082 --> 11:56.578
take advantage of them, try to run them
down.

11:56.779 --> 11:59.531
But if you are emotionally attached
to your country,

11:59.732 --> 12:05.281
then you’ll bring good name to your country
by doing real good work.

12:05.482 --> 12:09.851
I don’t know why people do not know
how to discriminate.

12:10.021 --> 12:13.140
Why are they so selfish, trying to build
them up,

12:13.341 --> 12:20.296
trying to do all the good things
for themselves?

12:21.942 --> 12:27.002
There is a very great chance for all of you
to get this

12:27.203 --> 12:31.533
within you, your reach, because you are
all Sahaja Yogis.

12:31.734 --> 12:33.995
You have become like lotuses.

12:34.196 --> 12:38.706
And the lotus has the fragrance which
spreads all over

12:38.907 --> 12:42.970
and days together it stays in the water,
in that dirty water,

12:43.171 --> 12:46.050
and it spreads the fragrance.

12:46.251 --> 12:49.520
With that fragrance also, you can do lots
of things,

12:49.721 --> 12:57.848
that the bees come there, they sleep
in that beautiful house of the lotus

12:58.033 --> 13:01.996
and in the night it closes down very
carefully.

13:02.197 --> 13:23.376
All kinds of things that come for the
flower to take the beauty of that flower,

13:23.577 --> 13:30.689
you can say, because you can extract also
the essence of that, which has fragrance.

13:30.890 --> 13:36.553
You can also get some honey out of that.
Whatever is possible,

13:36.754 --> 13:39.884
everybody comes to that flower.

13:40.085 --> 13:43.430
That doesn’t mean that flower in any way
is weak,

13:43.631 --> 13:49.757
but that’s its quality, that’s its strength,
that’s its understanding.

13:51.007 --> 13:55.610
That’s what you are. You are all made
into lotuses.

13:55.811 --> 14:05.056
You are not made into some sort of creeps
or some sort of stupid donkeys, no!

14:05.257 --> 14:10.587
You are the people who are to give
fragrance of your love,

14:10.788 --> 14:17.040
fragrance of your compassion to others.
And you should feel happy about it.

14:17.241 --> 14:21.493
That doesn’t mean that you give up this,
give up that. Nothing of the kind.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.907
But it means that, whatever you have,

14:24.108 --> 14:26.399
whatever is your possibility, capability,

14:26.600 --> 14:31.420
you must try to do for others, give it
to them.
