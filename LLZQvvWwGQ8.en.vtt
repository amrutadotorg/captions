WEBVTT

04:54.566 --> 05:11.197
We have arranged this Puja specially in England
so that many more can come and work out the

05:11.197 --> 05:15.687
awakening of Shri Krishna.

05:15.687 --> 05:35.497
Gita was written long time back, and it has
been translated into so many languages, and

05:35.497 --> 05:51.517
lots of commentaries and criticism has been
there.  So this bookish knowledge of Gita

05:51.517 --> 05:59.887
has ruined many people, and even today you
find there are many people who are selling

05:59.887 --> 06:08.417
the books of Gita all over and making it into
a bookish knowledge.  I don’t think Krishna

06:08.417 --> 06:16.917
ever thought that His knowledge will be sold
out like this to every Tom, Dick and Harry.

06:16.917 --> 06:24.867
As now, as you know, the Jehovah’s Witness,
they also selling Bible.  So it has become

06:24.867 --> 06:32.667
a marketing company for Shri Krishna’s Gita.

06:32.667 --> 06:44.377
There have been lots of horrible things against
the real religion of ascent, and Krishna has

06:44.377 --> 06:52.177
said, “Whenever there is the decline of
religion,” which is true today very much,

06:52.177 --> 07:05.936
“and whenever there is the saints being
tortured, I come on this earth to save the

07:05.936 --> 07:19.317
saints, and to destroy all the negative forces
and the devils,” as you call them, rakshasas.

07:19.317 --> 07:31.727
Pushtas they are called as, cruel people.
So awakening of Krishna is very important,

07:31.727 --> 07:43.716
that within us He should arise and He should
manifest His qualities within us.  Then only

07:43.716 --> 07:47.867
the forces will work out.

07:47.867 --> 07:58.056
Krishna, as a child, killed so many rakshasas.
Then He played with gopis just to open their

07:58.056 --> 08:12.826
Kundalini; He had the rasa by which to make
the energy of Shri Radha to pass through them.

08:12.826 --> 08:27.007
After killing Kamsa, the main rakshasa who
was ruling, who was actually His uncle, He

08:27.007 --> 08:33.596
killed him.  That means, your relations,
if they are devils and they are rakshasas,

08:33.596 --> 08:42.037
they have to be killed. Because he is your
relation you should not try to save him and

08:42.037 --> 08:52.717
try to bestow his evil on Sahaja Yogis or
on Sahaja Yoga.

08:52.717 --> 08:58.476
So Sahaja Yoga is the only organization in
the whole world, whether you call it spiritual

08:58.476 --> 09:06.476
or whatever you may call it, is the only organization
that it is also anxious to throw away many

09:06.476 --> 09:12.727
people from Sahaja Yoga.  There is no organization
- I mean we are not organization, also. But

09:12.727 --> 09:21.007
there is no spiritual movement, there is no
movement in the whole world that not only

09:21.007 --> 09:27.447
allows people to go out of Sahaja Yoga but
throws them out, because it is bound by the

09:27.447 --> 09:38.178
divine laws and it has to abide by the divine
laws.  Shri Krishna’s style was that: what

09:38.178 --> 09:47.057
is the need to throw them away? Just kill
them, finished.  So He killed His own uncle,

09:47.057 --> 09:55.057
making His own aunt a widow.  His own uncle
He threw away, out of the world, sent him

09:55.057 --> 10:05.047
to hell directly, finished it off. But in
Sahaja Yoga we give a chance for such people

10:05.047 --> 10:15.697
also who are very devilish types, who are
very detrimental to our growth, who are against

10:15.697 --> 10:23.957
spirituality, who are against God, we give
them a long rope to hang themselves. That’s

10:23.957 --> 10:36.487
the Mother side of this incarnation, but the
Krishna side is a very fast-moving one.

10:36.487 --> 10:49.367
Krishna did not live for very long.  In that
short time, how many rakshasas He killed!

10:49.367 --> 10:57.487
He fought on the side of Pandavas and He killed
all the Kauravas.  He didn’t kill, He said,

10:57.487 --> 11:12.027
but He did.  So the style of Krishna on one
side also is extremely sweet, extremely nice.

11:12.027 --> 11:17.497
He is like honey, that’s why He is called
Madhava, Madhu.  He is like honey on one

11:17.497 --> 11:31.607
side, only to the bees, only to the people
who want to be blessed by Him. But to the

11:31.607 --> 11:40.927
evil people, I think He’s one of the most
dangerous personalities.  Of course Shiva

11:40.927 --> 11:58.707
also does that, He has killed so many rakshasas.
And also Devi has killed many rakshasas, but

11:58.707 --> 12:08.867
She went into wars, actual wars, and She went
into discussions and arguments and things

12:08.867 --> 12:20.577
like that; but Shri Krishna, He never argued
and He knew how to get rid of them, one by

12:20.577 --> 12:28.166
one, and He played some tricks on them.
One of them I’ll tell you.

12:28.166 --> 12:41.547
There was a rakshasa who by pleasing Shiva
had got a blessing

12:41.547 --> 12:54.027
that he
is sleeping and in his sleep anybody wakes

12:54.027 --> 13:05.077
him up, such a person should be made into
ashes, bhasmasak.  Must be a good sleeper,

13:05.077 --> 13:18.066
I tell you, our neighbor, the camper, gets
some sleep like that.  And he said, “I

13:18.066 --> 13:21.517
should not be disturbed if I am sleeping.”

13:21.517 --> 13:25.417
So Shiva thought, “It’s a very simple
thing, you see. Why should anybody disturb

13:25.417 --> 13:31.897
this old Johnny? And he would be sleeping
in some cave somewhere, so it’s all right.”

13:31.897 --> 13:41.037
He didn’t think it would be quite dangerous.

13:41.037 --> 13:55.017
And he had also blessings that nobody can
conquer him, and

13:55.017 --> 14:07.637
he cannot be, he cannot be disturbed by anybody
who tries to conquer this boon on him.  So

14:07.637 --> 14:13.687
actually he was a saint, in a way, because
he was meditating and all that, but some saints

14:13.687 --> 14:19.666
become ascetic and become really, like you
should say, very right-sided.  So I would

14:19.666 --> 14:25.116
call him a rakshasa only because this kind
of people are of no use.  They just go on

14:25.116 --> 14:31.247
cursing people, saying things to them and
just finishing them off.  So then you, of

14:31.247 --> 14:36.986
course in Sahaja Yoga language there are only
two things; there are Sahaja Yogis or rakshasas,

14:36.986 --> 14:42.967
there’s nothing in between.  So we could
find he was a very right-sided, horrible,

14:42.967 --> 14:46.926
ascetic fellow who got this boon from Shiva.

14:46.926 --> 14:53.176
There was one rakshasa, actual rakshasa, I
mean that was no saintliness in him at all.

14:53.176 --> 15:01.176
This is a mixture, half-baked sort of thing.
You see, if you see the canvas of Mahabharata

15:01.176 --> 15:11.146
you will be amazed that all kinds of peoples
are described in that.  So now, this second

15:11.146 --> 15:17.916
one was a real, real rakshasa, born out of
rakshasas and was of a rakshasa quality.

15:17.916 --> 15:30.556
He, too, had another boon from Shiva that
nobody can kill him. Unless and until somebody

15:30.556 --> 15:43.116
who has got Your boon that he can kill somebody,
nobody else should kill him.

15:43.116 --> 15:48.377
Imagine poor Shiva, you see, He thought, “It’s
a very sensible thing, after all, so that

15:48.377 --> 15:55.027
he won’t cross Me.” He said, “All right.”
He’s very easily pleased, Shiva is, the

15:55.027 --> 15:59.466
problem is that.

15:59.466 --> 16:11.786
So this second one, the real one, the real
rakshasa was torturing people, and he started

16:11.786 --> 16:19.146
a big war and Shri Krishna also went in for
that war.  He was the one, that’s the only

16:19.146 --> 16:28.216
war He fought Himself and they were all fighting
there.  So Shri Krishna knew that this Shiva

16:28.216 --> 16:36.476
is not going to let this person down at any
cost, because he knows, “I am all right,”

16:36.476 --> 16:43.156
so He would not allow him to be lost.  So
what should we do?

16:43.156 --> 16:47.796
So He played a trick. He started running out

16:47.796 --> 16:56.296
of the battlefield.  Now is regarded as something
very cowardly to run out of a battlefield,

16:56.296 --> 17:02.647
you see.  I mean a person, if like that goes
to his house, his wife will refuse to have

17:02.647 --> 17:10.017
him.  It’s a very cowardly thing and it’s
very disgraceful, but what is for God, it

17:10.017 --> 17:17.127
has, it has - They have no sense of grace
or disgrace, you see.  So He ran out of the

17:17.127 --> 17:25.406
battlefield which we call, that’s why He
is called as Ranchodas, it means “the one

17:25.406 --> 17:28.947
who runs away from the battlefield.” Ranchodas.
It is His name. One of the names of Shri Krishna,

17:28.947 --> 17:39.786
is Ranchodas.  So He ran out, He ran out
and when this rakshasa discovered that Krishna

17:39.786 --> 17:45.127
has run away, he ran after Him. But Krishna
was running very fast, you see.  Rakshasa,

17:45.127 --> 17:52.166
being so bulky, could not run that fast, but
still he was running, you see.  And Krishna

17:52.166 --> 17:59.896
was seeing that he sees Him running up to
that, was keeping it.  So He went there and

17:59.896 --> 18:05.957
He entered into the cave where this another
half-baked rakshasa and half-baked yogi was

18:05.957 --> 18:16.817
sleeping.  He took out His shawl, Shri Krishna,
and put it on that yogi and He hid Himself.

18:16.817 --> 18:24.757
He covered his face – he was fast asleep
so very gently He did it.

18:24.757 --> 18:36.156
Now came the number one rakshasa, he entered
into the cave, couldn’t see Krishna anywhere

18:36.156 --> 18:42.967
but he saw this man sleeping, He saw this
is Shri Krishna,  “Oh, so now You are tired

18:42.967 --> 18:48.426
and now You are sleeping, now I’ll see how
You can survive, I’ll see to it.”  And

18:48.426 --> 18:58.247
he just went onto his throat, so this half-baked
fellow who was granted this boon, got up and

18:58.247 --> 19:06.646
he looked at him and with his third eye he
burnt him and he became ….  This is the

19:06.646 --> 19:08.567
trick.

19:08.567 --> 19:23.227
So that is how He killed so many rakshasas,
and also He told tricks to others in arguments,

19:23.227 --> 19:35.406
also He killed half-baked people, quite a
lot of them.  So I must say He was so powerful

19:35.406 --> 19:47.947
that He could work out any trick on people,
sitting down in one place. And there are so

19:47.947 --> 19:58.306
many stories about Him which I cannot tell
in one lecture, that His killing process was

19:58.306 --> 20:04.497
so smooth that nobody objected to it.

20:04.497 --> 20:09.976
There was a woman who was a devil, was sent
by Kamsa to kill Him.  And she had poison,

20:09.976 --> 20:18.476
she had put poison in her breast and she came
and she started nursing Him, and when He started

20:18.476 --> 20:27.476
sucking her (when he was a little boy of three,
four years, or maybe two years) her breast,

20:27.476 --> 20:36.216
she started becoming big, big and she died.
And then they saw that she was Putana, the

20:36.216 --> 20:37.747
one who was the devil, known.

20:37.747 --> 20:49.966
And once He knew that there are two rakshasas
who are camouflaged as two big trees.  So

20:49.966 --> 20:57.956
His mother tied Him once with - she was angry
because He was stealing her butter so she

20:57.956 --> 21:08.646
didn’t know what to tie so she tied Him
with a pounding - that we have got for rice

21:08.646 --> 21:14.956
pounding, a kind of a wooden thing, big thing.
It’s quite heavy.  So she tied Him to that.

21:14.956 --> 21:21.597
It’s such a heavy thing, I mean, you need
at least five-six people to lift it, but when

21:21.597 --> 21:27.606
she went away, Shri Krishna just walked with
it with His small, little feet, you see, and

21:27.606 --> 21:30.806
went near those trees and hit them both on
both the sides and both the trees fell down

21:30.806 --> 21:33.926
and the rakshasas died.

21:33.926 --> 21:46.706
He was so knowledgeable and so clever, because
you know that He is the brain. He is the Virata.

21:46.706 --> 21:54.687
He did it without any compassion whatsoever.
All His love, all His compassion, all everything,

21:54.687 --> 22:04.467
duty, was only meant for His gopis and gopes.
And then, when He became the king, also His

22:04.467 --> 22:13.237
life is very mysterious for people to understand,
but Sahaja yogis can understand it. But when

22:13.237 --> 22:20.097
He became the king, He had to have wives,
so He married five wives.  Imagine, more

22:20.097 --> 22:28.467
than Mohammed Sahib.  These five, why five?
Because they were five elements.  So they

22:28.467 --> 22:35.047
were the causal of the five elements so He
married five wives.  Now he had sixteen thousand

22:35.047 --> 22:38.117
powers.

22:38.117 --> 22:44.267
Now you see a man, he may be old, even about
ninety years of age, if he wants to keep some

22:44.267 --> 22:51.337
women around him, they will say he is a bad
man.  Not with a Mother, no, Mother can have

22:51.337 --> 22:55.957
as many as She likes, nobody is going to say
anything about Her character, because Mother

22:55.957 --> 23:04.237
is Mother. But a man, see, he might be absolutely
jumping into his grave, whatever it is.

23:04.237 --> 23:09.647
And there also, in India especially, if a
lady tries to help him out, to be out of the

23:09.647 --> 23:14.407
grave, they will say he had bad relations
with her.

23:14.407 --> 23:20.327
So it was such a bad situation at that time
that He didn’t want to have bad name.

23:20.327 --> 23:25.327
So He said, “What should we do about these
powers, because they’ll be women?  If they

23:25.327 --> 23:30.437
have to come on this earth, they’ll be women
and I don’t want to have bad name,” because

23:30.437 --> 23:38.637
He came for dharma.  So what He did that
these women became the princesses, and one

23:38.637 --> 23:46.977
king captured all of them.  All these sixteen
thousand women were under the capture of this

23:46.977 --> 23:57.677
man and this man was about to abuse them,
so Shri Krishna invaded that man and got hold

23:57.677 --> 24:04.017
of all these.

24:04.017 --> 24:21.277
So

24:21.277 --> 24:38.847
the

24:38.847 --> 24:45.347
sixteen thousand women which were captured
by this camp - imagine why should it be sixteen

24:45.347 --> 24:51.267
thousand?  Imagine sixteen thousand women,
it’s no easy thing to do.  This man had

24:51.267 --> 24:58.687
sixteen thousand women who succumbed to his
aggression and were there.  And then He attacked

24:58.687 --> 25:05.567
this man and captured those sixteen thousand
women and brought them and legally married

25:05.567 --> 25:10.067
them to show they were married. But what’s
the question of marriage because they were

25:10.067 --> 25:19.337
His powers?  And He used their powers, you
see. For what? For creating so many things,

25:19.337 --> 25:27.757
like if Shri Krishna had not come we would
not have known really the significance of

25:27.757 --> 25:30.777
spiritual life.

25:30.777 --> 25:38.008
He was the first who talked of spiritual life.
Rama did not talk of spiritual life, though

25:38.008 --> 25:42.497
there was an undercurrent in India.  People
knew there is spiritual life because there

25:42.497 --> 25:52.347
were saints, there were lots of what you call
the seers.  All of them were talking about

25:52.347 --> 26:00.877
it. But no incarnation talked about spiritual
life.    We had Rama Avatara, then we had

26:00.877 --> 26:05.737
Parashurama.  We had so many of these people.
Never, never they talked of spiritual life,

26:05.737 --> 26:13.857
never.  It was Shri Krishna only who first
started talking about spiritual life, and

26:13.857 --> 26:19.107
only to Arjuna He talked, because you see
what was the condition.  People were not

26:19.107 --> 26:24.427
prepared.  So those people, Sahaja Yogis,
who feel frustrated today because there are

26:24.427 --> 26:29.297
not many Sahaja Yogis or there is an obstruction,
there are certain problems, must know that

26:29.297 --> 26:36.267
at the time of Shri Krishna He could dare
speak about spirituality only to one person

26:36.267 --> 26:45.997
and that one was Arjuna.  So, I mean, we
are much better off, you see, aren’t we?

26:45.997 --> 26:54.087
Then, of course, of course after Shri Krishna,
who took the lead was Christ and He started

26:54.087 --> 27:02.567
talking about spirituality.  Even you’ll
be surprised that Abraham or Moses did not

27:02.567 --> 27:12.857
talk of spirituality.  They talked of God,
but not of spirituality. Till Christ came,

27:12.857 --> 27:18.297
nobody said that you are to be born again,
even on the other side of the world, only

27:18.297 --> 27:28.007
Shri Krishna said this thing.  Shri Rama
was taught by His guru that He should be born

27:28.007 --> 27:34.157
again, in the sense that what is the Kundalini
and all that, not that He should be born again.

27:34.157 --> 27:40.568
But He had become a human being, as I told
you. So he taught Him about Kundalini, he

27:40.568 --> 27:47.017
told Him about Kundalini but it was a very
secret science followed by only very nath

27:47.017 --> 27:54.277
pundits as we call them, as the Adi Nath and
all that.  Very few people were given Realization.

27:54.277 --> 28:01.067
In Rama’s time as we know of one, Nachiketa,
and His father-in-law was a realized soul,

28:01.067 --> 28:07.037
so compared to that, imagine how many of
us are today here who know about spirituality.

28:07.037 --> 28:13.967
Not only we feel our spirituality, we are
spiritual.  If you apply law of chance, I

28:13.967 --> 28:23.167
don’t think there could have been after
Christ even thirty people available, because

28:23.167 --> 28:30.357
if you see Christ died only two thousand years
back.  From Krishna’s time to Christ’s

28:30.357 --> 28:40.477
time it was six thousand years, and in six
thousand years Krishna had none and Christ

28:40.477 --> 28:51.377
had twelve, so now calculate only two thousand
years after that, how many could be?

28:51.377 --> 29:01.057
So we must know that it’s now in a new explosion,
that’s why I call it as “blossom time,”

29:01.057 --> 29:07.617
that we are definitely spiritual people, we
have got spirituality and that the Divine

29:07.617 --> 29:13.437
is working. So the Kali Yuga is finishing,
now it is Krita Yuga and the Krita Yuga is

29:13.437 --> 29:22.447
acting and this acting of Krita Yuga is responsible
for giving us so many Sahaja Yogis.  Krita

29:22.447 --> 29:30.517
Yuga means in the time when this all-pervading
Power has started acting.  Nobody before

29:30.517 --> 29:42.037
felt the cool vibrations, can you believe
that?  They felt the cool but not the vibrations.

29:42.037 --> 29:51.687
It was never related to any science; it was
never related to physical science specially.

29:51.687 --> 30:02.067
So I must say the achievement of Sahaja Yoga
is tremendous.   Also, thanks to this evolution

30:02.067 --> 30:18.017
in the acting of Yugas, also, that the all-pervading
Power has started acting as I am on this earth.

30:18.017 --> 30:21.367
But you could say that “Mother, why didn’t
You come earlier?”   That was not the

30:21.367 --> 30:28.217
time.  Even today you find stupid people
all around us.  I mean the percentage of

30:28.217 --> 30:35.917
sensible people seems to be quite low in the
western countries, though high up in others,

30:35.917 --> 30:40.747
but in the western countries very low, as
far as the wisdom is concerned.

30:40.747 --> 30:44.137
So we have these obstructions, these small
things going on, doesn’t matter.  Sahaja

30:44.137 --> 30:53.037
Yoga will now prosper.  It will flower and
whatever people may say, you shouldn’t worry,

30:53.037 --> 31:01.577
because once they start finding joy and happiness,
once they start finding the truth, and if

31:01.577 --> 31:06.187
they are honest, they will not leave Sahaja
Yoga. And many people know that they just

31:06.187 --> 31:10.457
don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.  I mean,
say there is a husband and wife, and the wife

31:10.457 --> 31:14.797
is a horrible woman, supposing, or the husband
is a horrible person and he obstructs the

31:14.797 --> 31:20.547
wife from coming to Sahaja Yoga, the husband
will say, “All right, you go ahead, I will

31:20.547 --> 31:26.487
be with Sahaja Yoga because I have now felt
the ambrosia, I have felt the beauty, the

31:26.487 --> 31:29.437
joy.”

31:29.437 --> 31:36.977
Now imagine at the time of Shri Krishna, He
talked to one person about the spirituality,

31:36.977 --> 31:46.507
only one person, Arjuna, which was heard by
Sanjaya and which he related.  It is so written

31:46.507 --> 31:55.877
by Vyasa, but He didn’t tell to everyone,
didn’t show to anyone.  He appeared in

31:55.877 --> 32:05.377
His Virata form on the battlefield but He
never showed, but now you have got photographs

32:05.377 --> 32:11.367
to see, even if you can’t see with your
eyes.  Some can see some things also, I’ve

32:11.367 --> 32:16.707
seen that some are feeling it. So you are
developing, you are growing into it.   So

32:16.707 --> 32:23.397
this is into a new realm.  It was Shri Krishna
Who started talking about it.  Of course

32:23.397 --> 32:28.137
these nath pundits did believe in all that
spirituality, but they did not talk about

32:28.137 --> 32:36.687
it, till the time, I think, of Gyaneshwara,
perhaps would be.  It was first the Gyaneshwara

32:36.687 --> 32:42.527
only who started talking about it.  Before
that it was a secret kept.  Of course after

32:42.527 --> 32:51.037
Gyaneshwara we had other people talking about
it, like we had Mohammed Sahib, we had Nanaka,

32:51.037 --> 32:58.987
we had so many other people like Shirdi Sai
Nath and some Sufi people and they started

32:58.987 --> 33:04.137
talking on spirituality.

33:04.137 --> 33:13.957
So we have to be historically very much thankful
to Krishna because He is the One who has broken

33:13.957 --> 33:18.757
the first knot and that’s why it’s called
as Vishnu Granthi and the Vishnu Granthi to

33:18.757 --> 33:29.647
knowledge has been first opened by Shri Krishna
and He wanted that gradually it should work,

33:29.647 --> 33:41.707
gradually.  So His Gita is not so clear cut,
but is diplomatically written.  So now we

33:41.707 --> 33:49.177
can find that the only person who first tried
his hand on Gita was Gyanadeva and Gyanadeva,

33:49.177 --> 33:54.577
when he wrote on the sixth chapter, everything
about Kundalini, they just said, “This is

33:54.577 --> 34:03.538
banned, you are not to read this one,” because
they could not deliver the goods.  People

34:03.538 --> 34:09.557
knew about Kundalini, but they didn’t want
to read because they were told, “No, No,

34:09.557 --> 34:14.997
don’t read, this is very wrong,” and all
that.

34:14.997 --> 34:23.967
So spirituality is a subject absolutely unknown
to the western people, though Christ was there

34:23.967 --> 34:32.567
but they have been only crucifying Him.
If I see the Christianity, if I see Christ,

34:32.567 --> 34:39.517
it’s so organized.  From Christianity nobody
can get out.  Whatever sin you may commit,

34:39.517 --> 34:47.487
you are still a Christian.  I know there
was a fellow who murdered someone and he was

34:47.487 --> 34:48.487
taken to the courts.

34:48.487 --> 34:50.157
They said, “What are you?”

34:50.157 --> 34:53.227
And he said, “I am a Christian,” though
he had murdered.

34:53.227 --> 34:56.988
Then they gave him the Bible, “All right,
put your hand on the Bible and say you are

34:56.988 --> 35:00.507
a Christian.”

35:00.507 --> 35:05.717
He said, “I am a Christian, I believe in
Bible.” But why didn’t they ask, “Why

35:05.717 --> 35:11.087
did you kill then?”  Thou shalt not kill.

35:11.087 --> 35:17.707
So even these religions which were formed
did not have any rules or regulations that

35:17.707 --> 35:24.157
“All right, if somebody does like that we’ll
throw him out of our congregation or he is

35:24.157 --> 35:30.577
no more a Christian.”  On the contrary,
you’ll be surprised that when My father

35:30.577 --> 35:41.657
joined Congress in India to fight against
the British, they threw him out of the congregation

35:41.657 --> 35:47.357
because according to the missionaries there,
Christ was born in England.  He must be

35:47.357 --> 35:55.557
an Englishman, so how dare My father join
the Congress?  Such an absurd idea!

35:55.557 --> 36:03.087
So all these ideas which are so absurd, against
God - against religion, against spirituality

36:03.087 --> 36:11.787
- became very prevalent and useful and convenient
for these organized religions.  That’s

36:11.787 --> 36:18.237
one thing good about Hindu religion is there
is nothing like a organization.  So they

36:18.237 --> 36:24.497
can be agnostic, atheist, they can be anything.
They could be Buddhist, they could be Jains.

36:24.497 --> 36:30.857
They could be anything and they could be Christians,
but they could be Hindus also because it’s

36:30.857 --> 36:36.598
not organized and because they are not organized,
there is no restriction on them that “Don’t

36:36.598 --> 36:41.747
do like this; don’t do like that.”  But
despite that I have seen, I’m surprised

36:41.747 --> 36:46.948
that Hindus are very meek people because the
responsibility is left to themselves, not

36:46.948 --> 36:52.257
on an organization.   If you have murdered
somebody you are not to confess to the priest

36:52.257 --> 36:59.057
but confess to yourself and face yourself
all the time. But so many filthy things crawled

36:59.057 --> 37:09.077
into this religion, also, of caste system
which is just against Shri Krishna.  They

37:09.077 --> 37:14.457
have no business to take Shri Krishna’s
name and do all these nonsensical things because

37:14.457 --> 37:22.497
Shri Krishna Himself has said that, “In
everybody it resides.” But they changed

37:22.497 --> 37:26.987
it a little, saying that, “Your caste is
according to your birth.”  How can it be?

37:26.987 --> 37:28.787
 As I told you the other day.

37:28.787 --> 37:43.547
Now this is another story I would say that
they have tried to, Christ look like something

37:43.547 --> 37:48.617
very ordinary or even Shri Krishna look like
something ordinary.  These are the intellectuals.

37:48.617 --> 37:54.567
So on one side we have the stupid followers
and the another side we have those stupid

37:54.567 --> 38:06.497
intellectuals.  So the message of Krishna
never reached Hindus because He said, “In

38:06.497 --> 38:12.177
everybody resides the Spirit and you are part
and parcel of the whole.”   Now a cell

38:12.177 --> 38:23.607
in the hand, is it an outcast because it is
not in the brain?  So what a wrong thing

38:23.607 --> 38:32.627
they have done to Shri Krishna and that’s
why when they suffer from racialism, I say,

38:32.627 --> 38:39.777
“You did the same to the caste, through
your caste system you tortured the Harigans,

38:39.777 --> 38:50.237
you tortured the lower caste of people.
So now you have them.”  It boomerangs,

38:50.237 --> 38:52.186
whole thing.

38:52.186 --> 39:00.426
So Shri Krishna’s life, if you see, is the
beauty of it is that He said that “Life

39:00.426 --> 39:11.767
is a leela” - for Him, not for everyone,
because He is so powerful. And this leela

39:11.767 --> 39:18.656
part was taken over by Americans very nicely
because they were born in the land of Shri

39:18.656 --> 39:23.547
Krishna, that it’s all leela. “What’s
wrong? Do what you like, what’s wrong?”

39:23.547 --> 39:29.107
Whatever you are doing is just a leela, is
just a play. So what?   Marry as many as

39:29.107 --> 39:34.597
you like, leave your children to dogs, do
all kinds of things with your morality, destroy

39:34.597 --> 39:41.557
yourself morning till evening, behave in the
same manner as if they are animals. So what?

39:41.557 --> 39:45.288
Study the animal behavior because it’s as
if we have no sense of behavior, so we study

39:45.288 --> 39:49.396
the animal behavior and behave like the animals.

39:49.396 --> 39:56.247
So are we going to become now snakes or some
sort of worms or I don’t know what they

39:56.247 --> 40:09.037
are up to, and whole system is just the opposite
of Shri Krishna.  So this stupid movement

40:09.037 --> 40:15.817
of Shri Krishna’s consciousness reached
there.  I don’t know how they understood

40:15.817 --> 40:21.667
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America,
but somehow some bhoot must have told them

40:21.667 --> 40:28.927
that “You go there.”  And they are another
stupid people who are selling Gita, selling

40:28.927 --> 40:39.567
this bookish knowledge, but now of course
it has boomeranged on him and now they are

40:39.567 --> 40:49.896
all right.  Now they are frozen. But the
way they have been talking about Shri Krishna,

40:49.896 --> 40:55.697
they do not realize they have missed the point.
He said, “It’s a leela.” So then why

40:55.697 --> 41:00.597
are you wearing these dresses, why have you
become a sanyasi?  Why are you giving up

41:00.597 --> 41:09.767
- not to eat this food, not to eat that food?
And then they are taking drugs, they are selling

41:09.767 --> 41:10.767
drugs.

41:10.767 --> 41:19.037
Whatever is not based on truth will go to
something that is destructive.  Truth is

41:19.037 --> 41:25.877
the only thing that is constructive.  All
these ideas sometimes confuse us, what is

41:25.877 --> 41:30.787
this, in the name of God, in the name of Shri
Krishna, in the name of Christ, in the name

41:30.787 --> 41:39.677
of Mohammed Sahib all these things are done
and also some people do it even in My name,

41:39.677 --> 41:46.627
“Mother said; Mother said so.”  It is
prohibited for Sahaja yogi to say that because

41:46.627 --> 41:54.207
I’ve had enough of it in last lives.
So this life nobody is going to say, “Mother

41:54.207 --> 41:57.107
said it.”

41:57.107 --> 42:06.457
“I say.” Have that much confidence and
responsibility to say, “I say.”   I

42:06.457 --> 42:12.297
am a Sahaja Yogi, you are a Sahaja Yogi, why
can’t you say?

42:12.297 --> 42:21.827
So now from today’s Puja onward we have
awakened the Shri Krishna within us, so His

42:21.827 --> 42:29.238
powers of sweetness as well of destruction
will act and you don’t have to worry, you

42:29.238 --> 42:32.927
are completely protected.  He has already
said that “Yoga dakshemo myam.”  “I

42:32.927 --> 42:40.277
give you yoga” and the “dakshemo myam”
means your benevolence, He looks after.

42:40.277 --> 42:51.997
So you don’t have to worry, but it will
act and it will work and nobody can harm you.

42:51.997 --> 43:01.717
It will all boomerang on them.  There’s
like divine punishment and you don’t have

43:01.717 --> 43:08.857
to worry.  Of course, as a Mother, I never
feel of punishing anyone, as such, but they

43:08.857 --> 43:15.807
just get punished, what can I do?  And now
this awakening can be very dangerous, so I

43:15.807 --> 43:23.947
think we have to accept it now within ourselves
that we have to be extremely sweet, nice,

43:23.947 --> 43:24.947
collective.

43:24.947 --> 43:30.527
If you are not collective then Krishna will
be after your life.  If you try to destroy

43:30.527 --> 43:34.737
collectivity He will be after you, I mean
He is a tremendous person, I tell you.  He

43:34.737 --> 43:41.157
is so tricky, He is so clever, and He is a
very smooth worker, I tell you.  So be careful.

43:41.157 --> 43:47.407
If you are collective then He’ll strengthen
you, He’ll nourish you, He’ll do everything,

43:47.407 --> 43:55.187
He’ll give you butter to eat.  So you have
to be collective, that’s the main part.

43:55.187 --> 44:00.087
And those people who just come to the program
and then disappear should know that it won’t

44:00.087 --> 44:05.467
work out.  You have to be collective and
if they don’t want to be collective, we

44:05.467 --> 44:10.587
don’t want to force them. But if they are
not collective they are not Sahaja Yogis and

44:10.587 --> 44:16.747
nobody should recommend them to anyone and
Sahaja Yogis should have nothing to do with

44:16.747 --> 44:25.957
non-collective people nor with people who
are not Sahaja Yogis.

44:25.957 --> 44:30.047
We have very beautiful children here, we have
beautiful families.   We have everything

44:30.047 --> 44:36.277
so beautiful, such beautiful people to love
each other and enjoy each other.  So we should

44:36.277 --> 44:42.887
not get entangled into the mess of other people
who are blind.  It would be like we have

44:42.887 --> 44:47.757
a nice organized place where everybody is
sitting in the light, suddenly you want to

44:47.757 --> 44:55.417
go to the place where there are many snakes
inhabited who are biting everyone.  So go

44:55.417 --> 45:00.537
ahead and then you shouldn’t say that “Mother,
you punished me.”   You wanted to go into

45:00.537 --> 45:08.277
the hell of the snakes, so you go and have
it.  I never punish. But maybe Shri Krishna

45:08.277 --> 45:17.577
might lure you there, you see that’s His
style, just to have a little bite of a snake.

45:17.577 --> 45:23.687
So according to Shri Krishna, we have to be
very playful.  Now we are all realized people,

45:23.687 --> 45:29.807
and you are very happy and you are all very
playful and joyous and also now you are so

45:29.807 --> 45:37.097
capable, you have spirituality, you can give
Realization to others.  Even I was told that

45:37.097 --> 45:45.287
in the streets people ask for Realization,
some people went to Eastern Blocs and they

45:45.287 --> 45:52.738
got five thousand people.  Somebody went
down to Argentina, got so many people.  So

45:52.738 --> 45:58.007
it’s very good, all these, My hands are
extending and the work is taking place.

45:58.007 --> 45:59.557
Everybody should take it up.

45:59.557 --> 46:03.327
Select a place and I’ll go there and work
it out.  Select one place and work it out,

46:03.327 --> 46:09.106
all of you can do it because you have now
got the powers, better work it out, use them.

46:09.106 --> 46:13.896
If you don’t use the powers, you’ll become
blunt, so use your powers and believe that

46:13.896 --> 46:19.607
you have power and that only thing you have
to keep in the bounds, in the maryadas of

46:19.607 --> 46:29.587
Sahaja Yoga, that you have to lead a very
moral, good life and you must feel your vibrations

46:29.587 --> 46:38.317
properly and keep good health which you can
easily do.  If, as they say, I can work like

46:38.317 --> 46:42.997
this, days in, day out, you can also work.
You are all very young, everybody seems to

46:42.997 --> 46:50.877
be younger than Me.  I am the oldest person
here.   So if I could do so much, why can’t

46:50.877 --> 46:51.877
you?

46:51.877 --> 46:55.937
So one thing you must ask in your prayer in
the evening when you are sleeping: “What

46:55.937 --> 47:02.127
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?” One sentence,
all of you, just ask this question: “What

47:02.127 --> 47:14.467
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”   Like persons
like Me or Shri Krishna or anyone, We don’t

47:14.467 --> 47:19.157
even feel We are doing anything.  So what
can We ask?   If I want to ask Myself, I’ll

47:19.157 --> 47:23.917
fall into an ocean I think, I don’t know,
I’ll be lost.  If I want to analyze Myself, I

47:23.917 --> 47:28.887
get lost.  If I want to think about Myself,
I get lost.  It’s beyond Me, then let it

47:28.887 --> 47:38.007
be, doesn’t matter.  I don’t want to
know Myself. But you better know yourself.

47:38.007 --> 47:40.157
You can’t be Me.

47:40.157 --> 47:48.927
So as far as I am concerned I only think that
as long as I live - I don’t know, I may

47:48.927 --> 47:54.477
live forever, I am living forever maybe, you
might say that, but whatever it is as long

47:54.477 --> 48:15.787
as I’m on this earth I will see that Sahaja
Yoga is fully established.  This is My promise

48:15.787 --> 48:16.797
to you.

48:16.797 --> 48:17.797
[Maharathi]

48:17.797 --> 48:24.157
He comes on this earth again to establish
the religion, but not only religion but Vishwa

48:24.157 --> 48:30.427
Nirmala Dharma, which is a much higher religion
than the ordinary religion of human beings.

48:30.427 --> 48:31.427
within themselves, is the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma
we’ll establish in a very short time, I’m

48:31.427 --> 48:32.427
sure, on this earth.

48:32.427 --> 48:33.427
So may God bless you!

48:33.427 --> 48:34.427
So today the children are sleeping now – if
they can get up for a while they can come

48:34.427 --> 48:35.427
and wash My feet.  How many are awake?
Some are awake.  You can sing some Ganesha

48:35.427 --> 48:36.427
song instead of Atharva Sheersha.
(break in recording)

48:36.427 --> 48:37.427
…. no provision for this kind of acceptance
of these ornaments, but when he came he just

48:37.427 --> 48:38.427
tried to take everything that was in that
temple.  At that time the story was created,

48:38.427 --> 48:39.427
I don’t know how far it is true, but a story
of Indians, you see, Indian style.  The story

48:39.427 --> 48:40.427
was like this: that when Mahadeva was attacked
by him, He started running away from the temple.

48:40.427 --> 48:41.427
He was running, running, running, running
fast and then He found Bhairava sitting there.

48:41.427 --> 48:42.427
So Bhairava and Hanumana both were sitting
and They said, “You are the Devas of Devas,

48:42.427 --> 48:43.427
You are the Mahadeva of Devas and why are
You running?  After all, what is he, this

48:43.427 --> 48:44.427
Tamolang?  Why running? He was lame with
one foot and why are you running away from

48:44.427 --> 48:45.427
him? You can just finish him off; what is
the need to run away?”

48:45.427 --> 48:46.427
No, he was Mohammed Gazni. Sorry, he was Mohammed
Gazni who did it, but  Tamolanga also attacked

48:46.427 --> 48:47.427
but then Mohammed Gazni. So this Mohammed
Gazni was running after Mahadeva, and first Tamolanga

48:47.427 --> 48:48.427
has looted but he couldn’t go to that far,
so this Mohammed Gazni came in and he started

48:48.427 --> 48:49.427
looting that temple.  So then when he started
running after Mahadeva, Mahadeva told him,

48:49.427 --> 48:50.427
“You don’t know, you don’t know this
Mohammed Gazni, who is. His name is Mohammed

48:50.427 --> 48:51.427
Gazni but he is somebody else.”

48:51.427 --> 48:52.427
Said, “Who is he?”

48:52.427 --> 48:53.427
“All right, come, you hide here, I’ll
show you.”

48:53.427 --> 48:54.427
So behind Mahadeva was running Mohammed Gazni,
so they hid themselves on one side and they

48:54.427 --> 48:55.427
saw this Mohammed Gazni came and he was very
tired.  He sat down near one tree and he

48:55.427 --> 48:56.427
started just relaxing, and suddenly they found
it was Shri Krishna.  He said, “This valundar,”

48:56.427 --> 48:57.427
means this, this cunning fellow, “is running
after me, now do you think I may escape him?

48:57.427 --> 48:58.427
Of course I should have punished these Brahmins
who were misbehaving.  I did not so, he has

48:58.427 --> 48:59.427
come, but now I cannot help so I am away out
of it, you see, because this one has come

48:59.427 --> 49:00.427
after My life and now you cannot save yourself.”

49:00.427 --> 49:01.427
So this is the story the people, the general
public, created there.  So it has happened

49:01.427 --> 49:02.427
many a times because He was the brother of
the Shakti of Shiva and because He’s so

49:02.427 --> 49:03.427
clever, he’s so intelligent that Shiva was
quite afraid of Him, and overactive.   So

49:03.427 --> 49:04.427
you see Americans are extremely active people
and now, of course, England, we need not say.

49:04.427 --> 49:05.427
It’s a little lethargic, little bit, not
much.  So now the awakening of Shri Krishna

49:05.427 --> 49:06.427
is going to work everywhere, and you are all
going to be extremely active about Sahaja

49:06.427 --> 49:07.427
Yoga, I think so.  This is a new thing that
has happened, and I’m very happy it has

49:07.427 --> 49:08.427
happened and that the Americans also agreed
to come here.  By this we take a little bit

49:08.427 --> 49:09.427
of the qualities of Shiva to America, that
is of magnanimity and also of laziness a little

49:09.427 --> 49:10.427
bit, and give some qualities of Shri Krishna
to this country.  This exchanges it.

49:10.427 --> 49:11.427
Shri Krishna Puja 1990: Shri Mataji speaks
about the music to be played by the musicians.

49:11.427 --> 49:12.427
Below is a transcription of the relevant details.

49:12.427 --> 49:13.427
Now the last raga is Bhairavi has to be played
under all traditional ways and is a raga that

49:13.427 --> 49:14.427
is in praise of the power of the Spirit, because
it has such beautiful notes and notes which

49:14.427 --> 49:15.427
are … it’s a complete sampurna, is a complete
raga. All the twelve notes are in it. So you

49:15.427 --> 49:16.427
see it is such a complete raga and it has
to be played in all due respect to it. It’s

49:16.427 --> 49:17.427
a ragini, regarded as.

49:17.427 --> 49:18.427
Now as you know that the Heart Chakra has
got twelve petals, and the Durga resides on

49:18.427 --> 49:19.427
the Heart Chakra. Now the Durga’s qualities
are that She is protective of Her children,

49:19.427 --> 49:20.427
She’s very gentle, very soft with Her children,
and She’s extremely horrifying to the satanic

49:20.427 --> 49:21.427
people, to the negative people. So in this
raga I think because there are, the notes

49:21.427 --> 49:22.427
are spaced out. So either you could play it
slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in

49:22.427 --> 49:23.427
between. That’s why it is on a Durga’s
style. You see, either She is extremely gentle

49:23.427 --> 49:24.427
or She is extremely horrifying. So because
She has a double function: is one to look

49:24.427 --> 49:25.427
after Her children, and another is protect
Her children from the devils. So She has to

49:25.427 --> 49:26.427
be very quick about it, to fight them, and
to, in every way to frighten them and to be

49:26.427 --> 49:27.427
alert about it.

49:27.427 --> 49:28.427
So in the second part you all became very
alerted I saw. In the first part you were

49:28.427 --> 49:29.427
having a lullaby because it was the Mother’s
love that was playing. The second part you

49:29.427 --> 49:30.427
became alert, because She has to fight. Now,
this is such a nice raga because it gives

49:30.427 --> 49:31.427
you a better sense of security within yourself,
builds up sense of security, and also as you

49:31.427 --> 49:32.427
know medically that it’s important to build
up this chakra because that gives you antibodies

49:32.427 --> 49:33.427
created. So to fight all the diseases, to
fight all the foreign things which try to

49:33.427 --> 49:34.427
attack us.

49:34.427 --> 49:35.427
So this raga is so apt, absolutely apt for
today’s atmosphere and for today’s need.

49:35.427 --> 49:36.427
That we have to have the security of the Mother
and the protection of the Mother and that

49:36.427 --> 49:37.427
all the evil forces must be finished from
this world, and that’s how this raga has

49:37.427 --> 49:38.427
a very great significance and I thank him
very much for playing this raga.

49:38.427 --> 49:39.427
This is, now the last five minutes he would
like to play is the Bhairavi which is a complete

49:39.427 --> 49:40.427
raga as you can call it, is the complete purnima.
All the notes are there. And it is played

49:40.427 --> 49:41.427
in various ways and various styles and is
used for so many expressions of your feelings

49:41.427 --> 49:42.427
and thing. But in this also there’s a beautiful
song as you know, the Anhi Bhavani, is the

49:42.427 --> 49:43.427
one which is a song about the Mother Goddess.
And in this Anhi Bhavani, I think there is

49:43.427 --> 49:44.427
a little mixture in the … I don’t know
if it is absolutely pure Bhairavi or not.

49:44.427 --> 49:45.427
Shri Mataji asks musicians: It is to be played
absolutely in Shuddha Bhairavi?

49:45.427 --> 49:46.427
(Shri Mataji and musicians discuss together
a little then She asserts ... )

49:46.427 --> 49:47.427
It should be played in pure Bhairavi – this
is the best way. Because Bhairavi is the name

49:47.427 --> 49:48.427
of the Goddess.

49:48.427 --> 49:49.427
You see the purity of it creates that feeling
and that, I mean, it awakens that deity so

49:49.427 --> 49:50.427
that you get that effect with the Bhairavi.

49:50.427 --> 49:51.427
(Shri Mataji and musicians talk together then
She continues ... )

49:51.427 --> 49:52.427
Indian music has such a lot of freedom, such
a lot of freedom. You can do what you like

49:52.427 --> 49:53.427
with it. But only thing is you have to keep
to the ragas and you have to keep to the Swaras

49:53.427 --> 49:54.427
and everything. You cannot just go crazy from
one to another like that. So it is like a

49:54.427 --> 49:55.427
big aeroplane which is going in the air with
everything completely fixed properly. You

49:55.427 --> 49:56.427
see, so it can go anywhere. Unless and until
it’s fixed, has it’s own maryadas it cannot

49:56.427 --> 49:57.427
go. So that has to be there. So first the
ragas are built, and built in such a way they

49:57.427 --> 49:58.427
are absolutely perfect and then you can go
wherever you feel like. Nothing will happen.

49:58.427 --> 49:59.427
(More discussion with musicians.)

49:59.427 --> 50:00.427
(Raga begins. Shri Mataji continues ...)

50:00.427 --> 50:01.427
First, he will play all the twelve notes which
are built in Bhairavi and then you will see

50:01.427 --> 50:02.427
how he keeps to that. He keeps to that

50:02.427 --> 50:03.427
Wow, wow! It’s the Heart Chakra. It’s
the Heart Chakra of Shiva.

50:03.427 --> 50:04.427
(Musicians continue to play.)

50:04.427 --> 50:05.427
The surrendering, you see. Islam is surrender.
Islam is the surrender.

50:05.427 --> 50:06.427
(Musicians continue to play.)

50:06.427 --> 50:07.427
Musician: In India it used to be different
about thirty or forty years ago, this is the

50:07.427 --> 50:08.427
kind of music we used to have, when people
would sit like you are, here, so nice, so

50:08.427 --> 50:09.427
beautiful, a family.

50:09.427 --> 50:10.427
Shri Mataji: Absolutely a family rapport.

50:10.427 --> 50:11.427
Musician: Absolutely

50:11.427 --> 50:12.427
Musician: You bring out that from us.

50:12.427 --> 50:13.427
Shri Mataji: You see what he’s saying is
this. You know I am such an old woman of sixty-seven

50:13.427 --> 50:14.427
years and I think of My childhood and also
of My family. My father was a great, great

50:14.427 --> 50:15.427
connoisseur of music and he supported music,
and musicians left and right, and we heard

50:15.427 --> 50:16.427
all the musicians because they would come
to our house, stay with us and he would go

50:16.427 --> 50:17.427
all out to spend for them, pay for them; I
mean, do all kinds of things. So in the family

50:17.427 --> 50:18.427
the music came in and then My sister took
to music and everybody in family took to music

50:18.427 --> 50:19.427
quite a lot because of My father because he
was fond of cricket and also of music very

50:19.427 --> 50:20.427
much. But the best part of it, what I am feeling,
all the family would sit down and then My

50:20.427 --> 50:21.427
sister would sing or anybody, you see the
rapport. Then he would give the, what you

50:21.427 --> 50:22.427
call, the impetus, he would give us the feelings
of: “Now, this is it now coming up.”

50:22.427 --> 50:23.427
There’s such a rapport in the whole thing
between the musician and all, and with such

50:23.427 --> 50:24.427
relaxation everybody appreciating it and just
like waves after waves of a big ocean coming

50:24.427 --> 50:25.427
over and that sort of a thing it was. And
then only you can enjoy music. But if you

50:25.427 --> 50:26.427
are worried about time, this, that… we give
up all that to listen to music. And even if

50:26.427 --> 50:27.427
you carry all that load with you, what’s
the use of listening to music? You have to

50:27.427 --> 50:28.427
come to music with all these things left out
and then you really enjoy the whole thing.

50:28.427 --> 50:29.427
And that is what today I feel that our whole
family of Sahaja Yogis are enjoying this rapport

50:29.427 --> 50:30.427
with him and enjoying the whole beauty of
the whole music, it’s something so great.

50:30.427 --> 50:31.427
But see the surrendering, you just develop
the feeling what you get out of it, you see

50:31.427 --> 50:32.427
like….

50:32.427 --> 50:32.429
(Music continues.)
