16:37.085 --> 16:42.131
ï»¿I bow to all the seekers of truth.

17:10.638 --> 17:18.575
At the very outset, I have to tell you that truth is what it is.

17:22.595 --> 17:26.665
We cannot change it.

17:27.103 --> 17:31.556
We cannot describe it.

17:31.806 --> 17:40.534
Unfortunately, at this human awareness, we cannot feel it.

17:46.161 --> 17:54.458
Absolute truth has to be felt on you central nervous system.

18:01.874 --> 18:05.462
Now, whatever I am going to tell you tonight,

18:05.663 --> 18:14.208
you have to take it not for granted at all.

18:18.894 --> 18:25.373
We have had inner problems of blind faith.

18:29.643 --> 18:37.825
But if you treat it as a hypothesis and if it is proved,

18:38.026 --> 18:43.651
then you have to accept it as honest people.

18:57.013 --> 19:03.931
The truth is that you are not this body, this mind, this intellect,

19:04.132 --> 19:09.905
these emotions, these conditioning and ego.

19:17.388 --> 19:22.356
But you are the pure Spirit.

19:27.874 --> 19:34.952
Here now you see beautiful flowers and we take it for granted.

19:38.794 --> 19:43.536
Actually it is a miracle.

19:47.075 --> 19:51.848
Many livings things, we take it for granted.

19:56.113 --> 20:00.664
Who runs your heart? If you ask the doctor,

20:00.865 --> 20:05.539
he will say: "It is autonomous nervous system."

20:12.584 --> 20:17.313
But who is this "auto"?

20:18.785 --> 20:21.646
So the second truth is that

20:21.847 --> 20:28.889
there's a All-Pervading Subtle Power of Divine Love

20:34.435 --> 20:38.468
that does all the living work.

20:43.094 --> 20:52.681
We cannot feel this Power on our fingers, but it exists.

20:57.381 --> 21:02.142
Today for the first time you all are going to feel it.

21:06.290 --> 21:13.134
It is called in the Bible as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

21:19.479 --> 21:26.273
In the Koran, it is called as Ruh.

21:28.530 --> 21:35.242
And in the Indian scriptures, it is called as Paramchaitanya.

21:38.537 --> 21:44.505
Patanjali has called it as Ritambhara Pragya.

21:46.739 --> 21:49.327
So in all the books,

21:49.528 --> 21:56.130
this Chaitanya has been described by different names.

22:00.059 --> 22:04.442
So "saha" means "with, "ja" means "born",

22:04.643 --> 22:11.666
is the right to have this yoga, this union.

22:20.528 --> 22:27.887
You all have this right to have this union with the Divine Power.

22:31.301 --> 22:38.777
Specially at this time, it was to happen.

22:42.173 --> 22:46.203
It's already been predicted.

22:47.321 --> 22:51.126
They called as Last Judgment,

22:54.281 --> 22:57.906
in the Koran they called it as Kyiama.

22:59.446 --> 23:03.188
And the great astrologer, the pioneer of Astrology,

23:03.389 --> 23:12.360
Gehrig has written that at this time, thousands will get their enlightenment.

23:21.182 --> 23:25.337
I call it a blossom time,

23:27.166 --> 23:31.751
where there are so many seekers of truth

23:34.432 --> 23:39.384
who have a right to get their enlightenment.

23:42.478 --> 23:50.869
So it is through the evolutionary process, the last breakthrough.

23:56.914 --> 24:02.481
This Power that connects you to the All-Pervading Power

24:02.682 --> 24:08.646
is called as Kundalini.

24:16.881 --> 24:22.461
"Kundal" is different circles.

24:28.152 --> 24:32.182
That's why it is called as Kundalini.

24:34.404 --> 24:40.170
It rests in the triangular bone which is called as sacrum,

24:40.371 --> 24:46.882
that means that Greeks knew that is a sacred bone.

24:54.403 --> 25:02.418
When this Power rises, it passes through six centers.

25:07.163 --> 25:11.586
All the problems of the world

25:11.795 --> 25:16.507
are mostly from human beings.

25:20.469 --> 25:24.422
And most of the problems of human beings

25:24.623 --> 25:29.123
come from these subtle centers within us.

25:34.192 --> 25:39.092
Thus when this Kundalini rises and passes through six centers

25:39.293 --> 25:46.357
and enlightens the fontanel bone area, passes through it,

25:46.558 --> 25:51.011
then it enlightens all the centers.

25:58.645 --> 26:05.723
It integrates it and also it corrects it.

26:11.277 --> 26:18.809
These centers are for our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being.

26:23.980 --> 26:29.418
Thus all our problems

26:29.619 --> 26:36.200
on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being are solved.

26:42.739 --> 26:48.215
In Delhi, there are two doctors who have got their MD

26:48.416 --> 26:53.352
for curing incurable diseases in Sahara Yoga.

27:01.571 --> 27:09.163
All over the world, we have doctors who are curing people

27:09.364 --> 27:13.326
of incurable diseases.

27:19.757 --> 27:26.726
The second thing that happens to you that your attention becomes innocent.

27:32.074 --> 27:37.192
Innocence is eternal, it's never lost.

27:40.754 --> 27:46.619
Of course there are some clouds on it.

27:49.666 --> 27:58.650
But with the awakening of the Kundalini, your innocence is established.

28:01.654 --> 28:08.169
And your attention becomes innocent devoided of lust and greed.

28:12.037 --> 28:18.060
Such an innocence, innocent attention is very powerful.

28:22.317 --> 28:30.262
And wherever it goes, it emits peace and joy.

28:36.236 --> 28:41.066
The another thing that happens to you automatically

28:41.266 --> 28:47.805
is that you can feel these centers on your fingertips.

28:54.781 --> 28:57.881
Is not going to people at all, is not,

28:58.082 --> 29:01.864
they can't hear Me.

29:08.820 --> 29:11.930
Is alright?

29:15.477 --> 29:25.604
This attention is innocent, but also is active.

29:29.460 --> 29:36.514
You can cure your centers by your pure attention.

29:41.396 --> 29:48.505
Also you can feel the centers of others on your fingertips.

29:53.417 --> 29:56.631
In the Koran, it is written very clearly

29:56.831 --> 30:01.240
that at the time of Kyiama, that is the resurrection,

30:01.440 --> 30:07.803
your hands will speak and they will give witness against you.

30:16.634 --> 30:20.540
So your attention, whenever you put it,

30:20.741 --> 30:27.717
is so pure that it acts on others also.

30:32.813 --> 30:36.586
But who is the other?

30:37.915 --> 30:44.337
Because you become, you become again collectively conscious,

30:48.788 --> 30:53.765
that you can feel the attention of others very clearly

30:53.966 --> 31:01.791
on your fingertips, the centers of others on your fingertips.

31:08.665 --> 31:15.149
Thus you have self-knowledge on you central nervous system.

31:22.796 --> 31:30.273
For example, we go to religion to find out a solution.

31:34.450 --> 31:39.069
For example, people like Christ and Mohammed Saab,

31:39.270 --> 31:47.040
very highly evolved Incarnations came on this Earth.

31:54.849 --> 32:01.254
We could not understand Them and They could not understand human beings.

32:06.036 --> 32:10.185
They did not know what sort of people they are facing.

32:14.309 --> 32:18.468
For example, Christ has said in the fifth chapter, Mathews,

32:18.668 --> 32:24.980
if your one eye commits a sin, take it down.

32:32.913 --> 32:39.733
And if your hand commits a sin, cut it out.

32:44.304 --> 32:50.499
If someone slaps you on one cheek, you turn another cheek.

32:54.160 --> 32:57.588
I Myself was born in a Christian family

32:57.806 --> 33:05.268
and I never see any man doing that without two eyes and without two hands.

33:12.163 --> 33:16.077
Christ was talking to saints.

33:17.879 --> 33:21.617
That's why He talked,

33:21.818 --> 33:25.966
that He was talking to angels.

33:27.333 --> 33:31.512
And Mohammed Saab was even worse,

33:32.786 --> 33:36.414
because He thought Christ has been very strict on men,

33:36.614 --> 33:40.133
why not on women? So He also said horrible things

33:40.333 --> 33:44.440
that have to be done to women.

33:49.850 --> 33:53.830
That if a woman looks another man with lust,

33:54.030 --> 33:56.916
she must be buried half in the Mother Earth

33:57.116 --> 34:01.241
and should be stoned till she is dead.

34:11.557 --> 34:17.018
Imagine what would have happened to American women, I can't understand.

34:20.724 --> 34:24.661
Where they could have been?

34:26.521 --> 34:34.188
On top of that, Shariat, which was given by Moses to the Jews,

34:34.403 --> 34:38.457
who were very decadent, greed took it over,

34:38.658 --> 34:42.234
because Jews defied it.

34:52.501 --> 34:57.129
So we can see that these restrictions

34:57.329 --> 35:01.579
are for people who are enlightened.

35:07.399 --> 35:11.727
And not for ordinary human beings.

35:14.162 --> 35:20.873
So first ordinary human beings have to become enlightened.

35:25.174 --> 35:29.408
They have to enter into the Kingdon of God.

35:32.945 --> 35:37.906
There only they can be punished like this.

35:42.077 --> 35:46.874
But in Sahaja Yoga, we have no punishments.

35:49.616 --> 35:54.623
Forgiveness is the only remedy,

35:56.920 --> 35:59.908
up to a point.

36:00.108 --> 36:05.712
And even after that if people continue to do wrong,

36:05.912 --> 36:10.738
then they are requested to get out of Sahaja Yoga.

36:18.902 --> 36:23.358
But once you get enlightenment, you become righteous,

36:23.558 --> 36:27.839
nobody has to tell you: "Don't do this, don't do that."

36:36.599 --> 36:42.650
In the light of the Spirit, you become your guide, your own master.

36:47.806 --> 36:51.270
Whatever is destructive, you give up

36:51.470 --> 36:55.634
and take to constructive for you life.

37:01.734 --> 37:05.198
This is like this, supposing I am an obstinate person

37:05.398 --> 37:10.273
and I have a snake in My hand and there's darkness.

37:17.468 --> 37:20.581
And you tell Me that there's a snake,

37:20.781 --> 37:26.320
but I will not give up because I am obstinate till the snake bites Me.

37:33.365 --> 37:38.404
But if there's a little light, immediately I will Myself give up.

37:44.252 --> 37:48.314
Nobody has to tell Me.

37:50.205 --> 37:54.893
You yourself become virtuous and righteous.

37:57.950 --> 38:06.617
So your health becomes first class, your mind becomes first class,

38:06.817 --> 38:12.630
because of that, your financial problems are also solved.

38:21.341 --> 38:25.686
We actually live in a relative world.

38:29.895 --> 38:35.332
Either we are thinking about the past or about the future.

38:39.097 --> 38:43.370
We are jumping on the cusp of this thoughts.

38:47.433 --> 38:51.878
But past is finished and future doesn't exist.

38:55.199 --> 38:59.256
We have to be in the present.

38:59.456 --> 39:03.636
And that is very difficult.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.846
When Kundalini rises

39:08.046 --> 39:14.834
She elongates those thoughts and our attention stands in the middle.

39:22.373 --> 39:26.971
And we become thoughtlessly aware.

39:29.896 --> 39:32.435
Means you are fully aware, but there's no thought

39:32.636 --> 39:37.170
from the future and the past.

39:43.363 --> 39:45.843
That is the time you grow spiritually

39:46.043 --> 39:50.421
and we get inspirations from the Divine.

39:55.882 --> 40:04.054
So we are in the present, which is the reality.

40:07.617 --> 40:13.969
And we know the reality, we become absolutely confident.

40:19.685 --> 40:23.961
Now the another thing that is very remarkable is that

40:24.161 --> 40:28.481
you know the absolute truth.

40:34.187 --> 40:38.593
That too on your fingertips.

40:40.468 --> 40:45.077
,Many people don't believe that there is God.

40:47.718 --> 40:53.163
Many people don't believe that Christ was the Son of God.

40:55.459 --> 40:59.001
But after enlightened, you just put your hands like this

40:59.202 --> 41:03.694
and ask the question: "Is there God?".

41:07.896 --> 41:13.247
And you feel a tremendous cool breeze flowing.

41:17.998 --> 41:22.274
Supposing there is a man false who comes and meets you,

41:22.474 --> 41:25.355
you just put your hands towards that person

41:25.555 --> 41:30.797
and you immediately will know what sort of a person he is.

41:39.875 --> 41:46.675
By recording the sensations on your central nervous system

41:46.875 --> 41:53.735
which is indicated on your fingertips, you can know everything.

42:05.539 --> 42:12.031
Such a person is blessed by the Divine Power.

42:16.752 --> 42:20.864
To such an extent that once they get Realization,

42:21.064 --> 42:26.506
they write letters to Me what miracles have happened to them.

42:35.070 --> 42:39.250
I've told somebody: "You better compile", and within one month,

42:39.474 --> 42:42.446
he telephoned to Me that: "They have come up over my head,

42:42.646 --> 42:46.701
I don't know what to select."

42:56.352 --> 42:59.855
When you become thoughtlessly aware,

43:00.055 --> 43:05.336
you become absolutely peaceful within yourself.

43:13.262 --> 43:17.507
I have seen people have got awards of peace,

43:17.707 --> 43:24.166
but what I know that they have no peace within themselves.

43:30.666 --> 43:37.705
And if you have to meet them, better take a barge pole.

43:42.322 --> 43:45.872
They are so hot-tempered.

43:46.073 --> 43:50.175
So egoistical and arrogant.

43:51.721 --> 43:57.354
How can you have peace if you have no peace within yourself?

44:00.717 --> 44:05.741
With Sahaja Yoga, it has been created

44:05.942 --> 44:13.362
a new race of extremely peaceful, loving, dynamic people.

44:19.873 --> 44:24.911
Sahaja Yoga is working in 65 nations.

44:27.495 --> 44:29.962
Of course in India is not difficult,

44:30.163 --> 44:35.291
but Russia has been a wonderful place for Sahaja Yoga.

44:42.564 --> 44:48.595
Russians are extremely sensitive to spirituality.

44:51.424 --> 44:56.814
At least 65 to 70%.

44:59.041 --> 45:05.666
The rest are materialistic, they want Malboro cigarette and all kinds of things.

45:10.295 --> 45:13.451
But they are all very well educated

45:13.652 --> 45:18.310
and this people has such a sense of spirituality.

45:24.357 --> 45:27.911
For example, Saint Petersburg University,

45:28.112 --> 45:31.695
which is one of the oldest universities,

45:31.896 --> 45:37.650
gave Me an award of Honorary Academician.

45:44.450 --> 45:50.262
And the tenth person to get it so far.

45:54.812 --> 45:59.460
And one of them is Einstein.

46:00.937 --> 46:03.908
And I was surprised, I asked them: "How do you put Me

46:04.109 --> 46:08.335
in the same line as Einstein?"

46:14.072 --> 46:17.598
So they said: "What Einstein has done is on the matter,"

46:17.799 --> 46:21.954
but You can work on human beings."

46:27.187 --> 46:33.203
In that conference there were two thousand great scientists.

46:37.479 --> 46:46.968
And they gave the subject of Medicine and Self-knowledge.

46:51.048 --> 46:56.242
But there were many others who spoke on morality and health.

46:56.443 --> 47:04.638
Morality has become a prime subject for these people.

47:14.394 --> 47:19.651
I was surprised scientist talking of morality.

47:22.839 --> 47:26.870
Because science is unmoral.

47:28.223 --> 47:36.777
And that is what they said that there is a gap with the science.

47:42.948 --> 47:48.904
I must tell you that I've been there only four times

47:49.105 --> 47:54.480
and in one place only, one place called Tolyatti,

47:54.681 --> 47:58.684
we have 21.000 Sahaja Yogis.

48:07.957 --> 48:11.558
There is a joke that they went once

48:11.759 --> 48:17.826
and one of the Toliatti Sahaja Yogi asked an American one:

48:18.027 --> 48:22.022
"How many Sahaja Yogis you have in America?"

48:31.523 --> 48:35.811
He said: "There are fifty-six."

48:38.504 --> 48:40.972
So a Toliatti Sahaja Yogi said: "Oh my God,

48:41.173 --> 48:47.254
"you have 56.000, we have 21.000 only in Toliatti."

48:52.166 --> 48:56.525
Because Americans lack maturity.

49:01.139 --> 49:04.434
They lack wisdom.

49:04.635 --> 49:08.809
They live like Hollywood actors and actresses,

49:10.301 --> 49:13.622
in the imaginary world.

49:15.810 --> 49:20.958
Like a one lady married eight times

49:21.159 --> 49:27.112
and ninth time she was going with a very young man for her honeymoon.

49:33.302 --> 49:40.911
And there were four, five thousand people just to see her going for her honeymoon.

49:44.635 --> 49:49.166
Not only that, but there were ten helicopters from where

49:49.367 --> 49:53.486
there were parachute down taking photographs

49:58.777 --> 50:04.112
They fell on people and some on trees.

50:08.231 --> 50:11.678
I must say India may be a poor country, but you won't get

50:11.879 --> 50:16.846
even one person to see such idiotic things.

50:22.966 --> 50:27.825
So Sahaja Yoga is not meant for idiots

50:29.575 --> 50:34.286
and for superficial people.

50:34.487 --> 50:38.893
It is of course not meant for arrogant.

50:40.456 --> 50:46.143
But it is meant for people who are true seekers of truth.

50:49.655 --> 50:53.233
In this seeking, people do go to wrong things.

50:53.434 --> 50:57.718
They have gone to false gurus, doesn't matter.

51:02.739 --> 51:07.778
You should know that we cannot pay for your enlightenment.

51:13.801 --> 51:17.207
God doesn't know money. He doesn't understand banking,

51:17.408 --> 51:21.316
that is our headache.

51:24.426 --> 51:28.036
So, if somebody ask money for your enlightenment,

51:28.237 --> 51:33.301
you better understand that he is a cheat.

51:40.699 --> 51:46.562
Also enlightenment doesn't mean some sort of a dressing up

51:46.762 --> 51:51.322
or shaving your hair.

51:58.256 --> 52:02.811
A great poet Kabira has said: "If by shaving your hair,

52:03.012 --> 52:05.012
if you are going to get your Nirvana,

52:05.220 --> 52:12.058
then the sheep who it is shaved every year will go there first."

52:23.925 --> 52:27.628
This time in Chicago, you will be surprised,

52:27.829 --> 52:33.204
I saw a Hare Rama fellow, the leader who came with a dot,

52:33.405 --> 52:37.744
that you wear, very light cloth.

52:47.391 --> 52:54.586
It was really very cold and as a Mother, I felt concern what is he after all.

53:00.902 --> 53:03.685
Then I asked him: "Why you are wearing a dot? It is so very cold,

53:03.886 --> 53:09.057
you will get troubles."

53:11.878 --> 53:14.878
So he said that "My guru has initiated

53:15.079 --> 53:20.401
and I am supposed to wear only dot, whether it is cold or not."

53:24.520 --> 53:30.246
And he said, "That is how it is I am going to get my Nirvana."

53:32.247 --> 53:36.083
I said, "In India, 80% people wear dots,

53:36.284 --> 53:41.299
if they are going to get Nirvana, then where you will be?"

53:49.403 --> 53:52.161
There is another really shocking thing.

53:52.362 --> 53:58.737
In Cabella, one fellow came and he told Me, that "I have become a very poor man,

53:58.938 --> 54:04.409
because all my money I have given to Dalai Lama."

54:12.451 --> 54:19.912
So in the name of God, how many types of people there are who are cheating,

54:24.805 --> 54:30.984
I have to tell you all these things because I am your Mother.

54:33.086 --> 54:36.836
I am not afraid of them.

54:37.037 --> 54:40.420
I am only afraid that you people are great seekers

54:40.621 --> 54:45.232
and you should not be lost.

54:49.562 --> 54:53.503
Guru Nanak has said, "The one who is a real master

54:53.704 --> 54:58.632
is the one who makes you meet the Divine."

55:04.520 --> 55:10.535
Christ also said that "You are to be born again."

55:12.200 --> 55:17.817
In Sanskrit, we have the word called "dwija" for a bird

55:18.018 --> 55:23.346
and also for an enlighten soul.

55:27.816 --> 55:34.893
That means a person who is born again like the bird.

55:39.219 --> 55:45.070
The bird is first an egg and then it becomes a bird,

55:45.271 --> 55:49.536
it has a second birth.

55:56.054 --> 55:59.734
In the same way, we have to have our second birth,

55:59.935 --> 56:04.062
where you get complete transformation.

56:11.577 --> 56:15.234
As it is, several people have that,

56:15.435 --> 56:20.200
"we are born again, we are Christians, Hindus, Muslims",

56:20.408 --> 56:24.470
these are nothing but brands.

56:32.301 --> 56:35.894
You maybe are a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

56:36.095 --> 56:42.212
but you can commit any mistake and can commit any sin.

56:49.690 --> 56:54.986
In Sahaja Yoga, you become, becoming is the point.

56:58.420 --> 57:03.248
And when the Kundalini pierces through your fontanel bone area,

57:03.449 --> 57:08.136
is the actualization of your baptism, actualization.

57:16.846 --> 57:21.729
It is the experience of feeling the Divine.

57:24.651 --> 57:30.314
Is not a lecture or it is not a sermon.

57:34.496 --> 57:38.012
But the greatest thing that happens to you

57:38.213 --> 57:42.253
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

57:49.325 --> 57:55.684
Happiness and unhappiness are two sides of a coin.

58:01.725 --> 58:06.498
But joy is singular.

58:07.725 --> 58:12.686
Where you become the source of peace

58:12.887 --> 58:17.110
and you witness the whole world as a drama.

58:24.726 --> 58:31.382
But you yourself become the light of peace and joy.

58:36.419 --> 58:41.005
Sahaja Yoga is working in 55 nations now.

58:44.974 --> 58:49.794
And I am amazed that I've never seen anybody quarreling,

58:50.018 --> 58:54.244
fighting or even arguing.

59:02.509 --> 59:06.665
They all enjoy each others company.

59:08.755 --> 59:12.528
Such pure love, friendship

59:12.729 --> 59:17.067
that you really feel a new age has started.

59:23.878 --> 59:31.277
Very pure relationships of husband and wife, sisters, brothers,

59:31.478 --> 59:34.259
I've never heard somebody running away with somebody's wife

59:34.460 --> 59:38.938
or somebody's husband in Sahaja Yoga.

59:46.600 --> 59:54.779
I really know there are so many great
souls who want to be born on this Earth.

59:58.993 --> 01:00:07.363
And if they are born to non Sahaja Yogi, they will never understand their children.

01:00:11.819 --> 01:00:17.787
Moreover they are anxious to be born to Sahaja Yogis.

01:00:22.937 --> 01:00:29.945
In this lecture, I cannot tell you everything about Sahaja Yoga, I'm sorry.

01:00:34.988 --> 01:00:41.316
Only in English language, I must have addressed five thousand lectures so far.

01:00:46.111 --> 01:00:51.056
But it is like this, we have so many beautiful lights here.

01:00:57.579 --> 01:01:03.305
And we have to just put on one switch and all the lights come in.

01:01:07.101 --> 01:01:11.312
Because it is built in.

01:01:13.945 --> 01:01:18.086
In the same way, it is built in within you.

01:01:20.860 --> 01:01:25.062
This is your own power.

01:01:25.263 --> 01:01:29.458
This is your own glory.

01:01:30.161 --> 01:01:34.333
All your protection powers will manifest.

01:01:36.981 --> 01:01:43.723
So many artists, musicians have become world famous today.

01:01:48.716 --> 01:01:56.067
You will be happy to know this time, Miss Universe was a Sahaja Yogini.

01:02:00.351 --> 01:02:04.265
She is going to see Me and she said, "I don't want to wear funny dresses."

01:02:04.466 --> 01:02:08.356
I said, "No, you can wear, if you can wear swimming dresses,

01:02:08.557 --> 01:02:12.764
is alright, doesn't matter, you go ahead."

01:02:21.970 --> 01:02:26.930
She is a very simple, intelligent girl.

01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.304
I wouldn't say she is a beauty or anything

01:02:32.505 --> 01:02:36.874
according to Hollywood standards.

01:02:41.006 --> 01:02:47.311
But her innocence and her pose or her intelligence

01:02:47.548 --> 01:02:54.150
has achieved this wisdom for her that she is today Miss Universe.

01:02:58.723 --> 01:03:02.707
So is a very remarkable thing that we don't know

01:03:02.931 --> 01:03:09.493
what qualities we have, what potential we have, how dynamic people we are.

01:03:16.690 --> 01:03:20.958
It is like a candle which is not get enlightened

01:03:21.158 --> 01:03:27.760
but a enlightened candle can enlighten the one which is not enlightened.

01:03:36.131 --> 01:03:42.720
This is like is a seed, if it is embedded in the Mother Earth,

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:47.755
it sprouts spontaneously, sahaja.

01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.393
Because the seed as well the Mother Earth

01:03:57.593 --> 01:04:01.936
has the built in quality to sprout.

01:04:07.248 --> 01:04:12.638
So believe Me, all of you have got this.

01:04:14.811 --> 01:04:18.998
And it will work out.

01:04:20.491 --> 01:04:25.092
Please have no doubts about yourself.

01:04:26.397 --> 01:04:32.072
Another thing is that this Power that is in the triangular bone

01:04:32.272 --> 01:04:36.975
is the Power of Pure Desire.

01:04:42.424 --> 01:04:46.712
All desires are not pure.

01:04:49.409 --> 01:04:53.254
You want to have house today, then you want to have a car,

01:04:53.455 --> 01:04:59.148
then want to have a helicopter, I don't know, goes on like that.

01:05:04.268 --> 01:05:07.682
There is no end.

01:05:07.883 --> 01:05:14.781
According to economics: wants are not satiable in general.

01:05:19.737 --> 01:05:28.291
Because they are not pure wants, pure desires.

01:05:31.035 --> 01:05:35.038
So you should have full confidence and also should have

01:05:35.238 --> 01:05:40.947
desire to be one with the Divine Power.

01:05:48.353 --> 01:05:53.416
I cannot force on you, you have to ask for it.

01:05:58.847 --> 01:06:02.971
Because I respect your freedom.

01:06:05.738 --> 01:06:10.448
This Power is your individual Mother.

01:06:12.659 --> 01:06:16.952
She knows everything about you.

01:06:17.152 --> 01:06:22.194
Like a tape recorder, She knows what are your desires,

01:06:22.394 --> 01:06:26.401
what are your aspirations.

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:38.261
And She is very anxious to give you your second birth.

01:06:41.393 --> 01:06:46.615
And as when you were born, your mother took all the troubles,

01:06:46.816 --> 01:06:51.647
this Mother of yours takes all the trouble

01:06:51.848 --> 01:06:56.941
and you get your Self-Realization.

01:07:06.090 --> 01:07:10.379
It will hardly take fifteen minutes.

01:07:12.066 --> 01:07:16.699
But those who don't want to have it should leave the hall.

01:07:19.924 --> 01:07:23.760
Because they cannot get it also.

01:07:26.617 --> 01:07:30.687
On the contrary, they will disturb you.

01:07:32.647 --> 01:07:38.562
If you have faith in yourself, I'm sure it will work out.

01:07:42.673 --> 01:07:46.767
You have to respect yourself,

01:07:47.376 --> 01:07:53.399
Because you are a human being at epitome of evolution.

01:08:07.771 --> 01:08:10.392
Now as I told you

01:08:10.592 --> 01:08:16.311
that this Kundalini, your Mother, knows everything about you.

01:08:21.049 --> 01:08:25.611
Please do not judge yourself.

01:08:27.306 --> 01:08:31.861
She knows, She judges you.

01:08:33.822 --> 01:08:42.720
So first condition is that you should not feel guilty at all.

01:08:50.047 --> 01:08:54.750
Whatever has happen in the past has happen.

01:08:56.578 --> 01:09:05.179
Why carry the guilty on your left side, this center?

01:09:10.130 --> 01:09:17.192
As a result of this mythical behaviour, you get spondylitis,

01:09:22.356 --> 01:09:25.281
or you get angina,

01:09:25.481 --> 01:09:28.939
or you get lethargic organs.

01:09:30.254 --> 01:09:35.816
You might even get diseases like tuberculosis.

01:09:38.269 --> 01:09:43.059
So why to carry this myth of guilt?

01:09:46.559 --> 01:09:51.207
You have to really forgive yourself.

01:09:52.895 --> 01:09:57.418
And should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:10:00.231 --> 01:10:04.148
Even in My lecture, if you think that I have said something

01:10:04.348 --> 01:10:08.590
that makes you feel guilty, forget it.

01:10:13.551 --> 01:10:18.246
The second condition is even simpler

01:10:18.731 --> 01:10:22.015
if you understand it.

01:10:22.215 --> 01:10:26.215
You have to forgive everyone

01:10:28.192 --> 01:10:32.418
even without thinking about them,

01:10:33.903 --> 01:10:38.530
because it is a headache to think about it.

01:10:38.731 --> 01:10:45.668
Now, logically whether you forgive or don't forgive, what do you do?

01:10:49.301 --> 01:10:52.351
You don't do anything.

01:10:52.551 --> 01:11:00.269
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

01:11:05.746 --> 01:11:10.847
All your life, you tortured yourself.

01:11:12.083 --> 01:11:16.633
But at this moment is important to get this center

01:11:16.833 --> 01:11:22.945
and the center in the optic chiasma opened out.

01:11:30.954 --> 01:11:37.149
If you feel guilty, this center won't open and the Kundalini won't pass through.

01:11:41.372 --> 01:11:48.863
But the worst is the center on the optic chiasma which is constricted like this.

01:11:52.200 --> 01:11:55.234
And it won't open unless and until

01:11:55.434 --> 01:12:00.434
you forgive everyone without thinking about them.

01:12:04.691 --> 01:12:10.390
As it is you are playing into wrong hands and by not forgiving

01:12:10.590 --> 01:12:16.934
you will miss the most important thing that is your enlightenment.

01:12:24.733 --> 01:12:33.615
Third condition is very simpler that I request you to get out your shoes

01:12:37.063 --> 01:12:40.453
I'm sorry I have to say that because in England, first time I said:

01:12:40.654 --> 01:12:45.979
"Please take out your shoes", half of them left the hall.

01:13:00.189 --> 01:13:05.329
This help us to be in contact with the Mother Earth,

01:13:07.228 --> 01:13:11.267
which help us a lot.

01:13:14.314 --> 01:13:21.306
Now, you don't say any prays, any mantras, nothing.

01:13:25.256 --> 01:13:29.482
Please don't try to concentrate.

01:13:33.145 --> 01:13:38.365
Kundalini Itself will take your attention upward.

01:13:41.662 --> 01:13:45.701
Alright.

01:13:52.264 --> 01:13:56.095
Those who are sitting on the ground are alright.

01:13:56.296 --> 01:13:59.369
But those who are sitting on the chair have to keep

01:13:59.569 --> 01:14:03.873
both their feet apart from each other.

01:14:13.759 --> 01:14:18.493
Please all of you do it, otherwise you can go.

01:14:27.904 --> 01:14:34.084
Because the left and right are two powers.

01:14:38.377 --> 01:14:44.291
The left one is the power of desire

01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:52.617
And the right one is the power of action.

01:14:56.454 --> 01:15:04.391
First we tell you how to nourish your center with your self-confidence.

01:15:09.429 --> 01:15:11.886
These exercises have to be done only for tonight,

01:15:12.086 --> 01:15:16.796
afterwards you don't have to do anything.

01:15:20.439 --> 01:15:23.155
Now, so please put your left hand towards Me

01:15:23.356 --> 01:15:28.319
like this on your lap very comfortably sitting.

01:15:31.877 --> 01:15:38.525
Why he is not doing himself there? What is the matter with you?

01:15:40.620 --> 01:15:45.315
If you don't want to do, you can go out.

01:15:49.814 --> 01:15:53.502
What is the matter?

01:15:57.877 --> 01:16:04.724
Alright. Now please understand that

01:16:04.924 --> 01:16:08.310
you have to be comfortable in your chair,

01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:13.271
but not slouch, not put one foot on top of other,

01:16:13.471 --> 01:16:18.036
but comfortably sitting.

01:16:28.455 --> 01:16:32.651
You don't have to go to Himalayas and stand on your head.

01:16:34.994 --> 01:16:39.205
You don't have to give up anything.

01:16:39.619 --> 01:16:45.220
I have told you it is not outside, but inside something has to happen.

01:16:48.994 --> 01:16:52.395
So please put your left hand on your lap,

01:16:52.595 --> 01:17:00.720
which is symbolizing that you have a desire to have your Self-Realization.

01:17:07.741 --> 01:17:12.659
Now put your right hand on your heart.

01:17:15.486 --> 01:17:24.426
We use our right hand for nourishing our centers on the left hand side.

01:17:28.728 --> 01:17:32.724
In the heart resides the Spirit.

01:17:32.924 --> 01:17:34.924
Please put left hand towards Me, try to understand,

01:17:35.125 --> 01:17:40.603
left hand towards Me and right hand on your heart, please.

01:17:47.500 --> 01:17:55.046
Now, we put our hand on the heart, where resides the Spirit.

01:17:59.282 --> 01:18:03.660
Now we take our right hand to the upper portion of abdomen

01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:08.766
on the left hand side.

01:18:11.727 --> 01:18:18.876
I've told you that if you become the Spirit, you become your master.

01:18:22.654 --> 01:18:30.825
So this is the center of your mastery, which is created by prophets and seers.

01:18:36.858 --> 01:18:43.858
Now, we take our right hand to the lower portion of abdomen

01:18:44.058 --> 01:18:48.058
on the left hand side.

01:18:51.717 --> 01:18:59.990
This is the center, surprisingly, is of pure divine knowledge.

01:19:05.116 --> 01:19:11.272
Now we take it up again in the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:19:14.461 --> 01:19:19.527
Then we take it on our heart.

01:19:19.727 --> 01:19:22.175
Then in the corner of the neck and shoulder

01:19:22.375 --> 01:19:27.367
and turn our head to right.

01:19:31.110 --> 01:19:35.117
I've already told you about this center.

01:19:36.163 --> 01:19:38.366
And quite that is in today with you,

01:19:38.567 --> 01:19:43.295
please don't feel guilty at all.

01:19:46.700 --> 01:19:51.536
I tell you, you have done nothing wrong.

01:19:53.067 --> 01:19:55.779
After all you are human beings and only human beings

01:19:55.980 --> 01:20:00.301
can commit mistakes, you are not gods.

01:20:05.282 --> 01:20:11.883
In Sahaja Yoga, there's no confession and there's no guilty.

01:20:14.327 --> 01:20:19.101
Is only love, compassion and forgiveness.

01:20:21.452 --> 01:20:31.483
Now, raise your right hand on top of your forehead across and put down your head.

01:20:36.366 --> 01:20:44.991
Here you have to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

01:20:49.587 --> 01:20:53.950
Now without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes,

01:20:54.150 --> 01:20:58.580
just for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness

01:20:58.781 --> 01:21:03.071
from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

01:21:11.389 --> 01:21:15.361
So take back your right hand on the back side of your head.

01:21:15.561 --> 01:21:19.780
This is the center for asking forgiveness.

01:21:28.699 --> 01:21:33.965
Now the last center, you have to stretch your palm fully.

01:21:37.930 --> 01:21:43.402
And put the center of your palm on top of fontanel bone area,

01:21:43.602 --> 01:21:50.338
which is a soft bone (...) your scalp.

01:21:55.580 --> 01:21:59.653
Now please, put down your head.

01:21:59.853 --> 01:22:03.908
And move your scalp seven times slowly.

01:22:10.221 --> 01:22:14.396
That is all you have to do.

01:22:14.596 --> 01:22:18.627
Now you have to close your eyes.

01:22:20.471 --> 01:22:24.865
Before that, see that you put your both the feet apart from each other

01:22:25.065 --> 01:22:29.221
and your left hand on your lap.

01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:50.653
Now, please close your eyes and don't open them till I tell you.

01:22:54.732 --> 01:22:58.770
Take down your hands now.

01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:05.341
And now put your right hand on your heart.

01:23:12.152 --> 01:23:14.936
Close your eyes.

01:23:15.136 --> 01:23:20.144
Now, here your have to ask Me a very fundamental question

01:23:20.345 --> 01:23:24.190
about yourself.

01:23:33.323 --> 01:23:38.760
You can call Me Mother or you can call Me Shri Mataji.

01:23:41.744 --> 01:23:46.466
So please say three times, ask a question:

01:23:46.666 --> 01:23:50.776
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:24:05.008 --> 01:24:09.847
I have told already to you that if you become the Spirit,

01:24:10.047 --> 01:24:15.008
you become your own master.

01:24:20.667 --> 01:24:25.061
So please take your right hand upper portion of you abdomen

01:24:25.261 --> 01:24:28.746
on the left hand side.

01:24:32.417 --> 01:24:37.749
And here, you have to ask another fundamental question

01:24:37.949 --> 01:24:41.948
about yourself three times.

01:24:47.477 --> 01:24:50.371
Please ask Me in your heart three times:

01:24:50.571 --> 01:24:55.590
"Mother, am I my own master?"

01:25:04.150 --> 01:25:07.384
Now,

01:25:10.752 --> 01:25:17.205
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

01:25:20.465 --> 01:25:28.285
And I cannot force on you the Pure Divine Knowledge.

01:25:32.585 --> 01:25:36.190
You have to ask for it.

01:25:36.390 --> 01:25:42.718
So please put down your hand in the left hand side of your abdomen,

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:52.017
in the lower region.

01:25:52.217 --> 01:25:59.529
Here you ask again six times because this center has got six petals.

01:26:04.587 --> 01:26:12.720
Here you have to ask: "Mother, please give me Pure Divine Knowledge."

01:26:23.701 --> 01:26:29.665
Now, as soon as you ask for Pure Divine Knowledge,

01:26:29.865 --> 01:26:34.607
your Kundalini starts moving upward.

01:26:41.166 --> 01:26:48.282
So we have to nourish upper centers with your self-confidence.

01:26:53.457 --> 01:26:56.858
Please now put your right hand the upper portion of your abdomen

01:26:57.059 --> 01:27:01.110
on the left hand side.

01:27:06.129 --> 01:27:14.161
Here you have to say ten times with your full self-confidence:

01:27:14.362 --> 01:27:18.776
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:27:36.074 --> 01:27:41.648
At very outset, I told you that you are not this body, this mind,

01:27:41.848 --> 01:27:47.554
this intellect, these emotions, your ego or your conditionings,

01:27:47.754 --> 01:27:52.192
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:28:02.778 --> 01:28:06.382
So now please raise your hand on your heart

01:28:06.582 --> 01:28:11.685
and say again with full self-confidence twelve times:

01:28:11.886 --> 01:28:16.387
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

01:28:27.042 --> 01:28:33.553
This All-Pervading Divine Power is the ocean of knowledge

01:28:33.753 --> 01:28:37.683
of bliss.

01:28:45.925 --> 01:28:51.144
Ocean of bliss.

01:28:52.339 --> 01:29:00.417
It is the ocean of compassion and love.

01:29:03.440 --> 01:29:09.909
But above all, It is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:29:12.479 --> 01:29:15.764
So whatever mistakes your might have committed

01:29:15.964 --> 01:29:23.292
can be easily dissolved in the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

01:29:30.603 --> 01:29:35.583
So please, forgive yourself.

01:29:35.783 --> 01:29:40.051
And put your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder

01:29:40.251 --> 01:29:44.236
and push your neck to your right.

01:29:51.889 --> 01:29:57.947
Here you have to say, again, with full self-confidence sixteen times:

01:29:58.147 --> 01:30:03.219
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:30:18.822 --> 01:30:27.462
I have already told you that you have to forgive everyone.

01:30:31.188 --> 01:30:38.024
Logically, whether you forgive or you don't forgive, you don't do anything.

01:30:42.996 --> 01:30:49.152
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:30:52.846 --> 01:31:02.260
So it is very important to forgive everyone without thinking about them.

01:31:08.643 --> 01:31:13.136
Leave them to the Divine Power to deal.

01:31:16.456 --> 01:31:25.862
Then you all raise your hand on top of your forehead across and please put down your head.

01:31:30.949 --> 01:31:39.644
Here you have to say from your heart not how many times:

01:31:45.798 --> 01:31:51.712
"Mother, I forgive everyone in general."

01:31:55.411 --> 01:31:58.547
At this moment, if you don't forgive,

01:31:58.747 --> 01:32:02.797
then this center which is so constricted won't open

01:32:02.997 --> 01:32:07.207
and the Kundalini cannot pass through it.

01:32:16.696 --> 01:32:21.778
Now without feeling guilty, without pointing your mistakes,

01:32:21.978 --> 01:32:26.942
for your satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness

01:32:27.142 --> 01:32:31.376
from the All-Pervading Divine Power.

01:32:39.876 --> 01:32:43.090
So please take your right hand back side of your head

01:32:43.290 --> 01:32:47.680
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:32:53.652 --> 01:32:59.658
Here you have to say, again, from your heart, not how many times:

01:32:59.858 --> 01:33:06.971
"Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong

01:33:07.171 --> 01:33:11.208
knowingly or unknowingly.

01:33:28.527 --> 01:33:34.347
Now the last center, which is very important.

01:33:37.819 --> 01:33:42.922
You have to stretch your hand fully, the palm fully

01:33:43.123 --> 01:33:51.674
and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area,

01:33:51.874 --> 01:33:56.937
it was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:34:08.529 --> 01:34:12.669
Now please put down your head.

01:34:14.474 --> 01:34:19.263
Please stretch your fingers outward.

01:34:21.333 --> 01:34:28.399
Here again I cannot force enlightenment on you,

01:34:28.599 --> 01:34:32.865
you have to ask for it.

01:34:38.310 --> 01:34:43.211
So now move your scalp seven times slowly clockwise,

01:34:43.411 --> 01:34:50.865
saying seven times: "Mother, please give me my Self-Realization."

01:35:35.064 --> 01:35:39.275
Now please take down your hands.

01:35:40.923 --> 01:35:46.103
And open your eyes slowly.

01:35:47.127 --> 01:35:51.416
Put both the hands towards Me like this.

01:35:54.221 --> 01:35:58.533
And watch Me without thinking.

01:36:06.464 --> 01:36:12.628
Now please put your right hand towards Me like this.

01:36:15.571 --> 01:36:19.550
And put down your head.

01:36:19.750 --> 01:36:26.996
See with the left hand if there is a cool or a hot breeze like vibrations

01:36:27.196 --> 01:36:33.266
coming from your fontanel bone area

01:36:41.409 --> 01:36:44.397
Please bend your head.

01:36:44.597 --> 01:36:51.097
And don't put your hand on top of the head, but away from it, near it.

01:36:57.176 --> 01:37:03.324
Now please turn, put the left hand towards Me like this.

01:37:06.346 --> 01:37:11.729
Again bend your head and see with the right hand,

01:37:14.940 --> 01:37:19.232
if there is a hot or a cool breeze like vibrations

01:37:19.432 --> 01:37:24.268
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:37:31.346 --> 01:37:35.502
Some people get it further.

01:37:38.409 --> 01:37:44.541
But if it is hot, then you have not forgiven yourself

01:37:44.741 --> 01:37:49.434
or your have not forgiven others, so please do that now.

01:37:57.288 --> 01:38:01.593
Now again, lastly, put your right hand towards Me

01:38:01.794 --> 01:38:05.971
and try to feel if there is any cool or hot breeze

01:38:06.172 --> 01:38:10.270
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:38:27.691 --> 01:38:33.535
Now do not doubt you, is coming from your own head.

01:38:40.455 --> 01:38:44.478
Bend your heads, bend your heads.

01:38:47.020 --> 01:38:51.590
Now, raise your both the hands towards the sky like this

01:38:51.791 --> 01:38:55.869
and push back your head.

01:39:02.864 --> 01:39:09.454
Here you have to ask a question three times

01:39:09.654 --> 01:39:13.684
anyone of these three questions.

01:39:18.263 --> 01:39:21.782
Please ask, first question:

01:39:21.982 --> 01:39:26.614
"Mother, this is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:39:33.537 --> 01:39:42.311
Second question: "Mother, is this the All-Pervading Power of Divine Love, the Ruh?

01:39:48.141 --> 01:39:53.336
Or "Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?"

01:39:55.383 --> 01:40:03.204
Ask anyone of these three questions, anyone three times.

01:40:07.585 --> 01:40:12.054
Now take down your hands.

01:40:19.969 --> 01:40:27.301
All those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips

01:40:27.501 --> 01:40:33.137
or on their palm or out of their fontanel bone area,

01:40:33.337 --> 01:40:38.555
even maybe hot, please raise both your hands.

01:40:52.526 --> 01:40:56.787
Brazil! I bow to you all the saints of Brazil.

01:40:56.987 --> 01:41:01.120
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

01:41:08.004 --> 01:41:12.348
Specially Brasilia.

01:41:12.548 --> 01:41:16.611
May God bless you.

01:41:32.507 --> 01:41:37.554
Please, one thing I have to tell you clearly,

01:41:40.617 --> 01:41:46.445
that whatever has happen to you is a collective happening.

01:41:49.700 --> 01:41:54.161
You can only grow collectively,

01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:02.114
not in your homes, but you have to come to the collective.

01:42:05.825 --> 01:42:10.192
You don't have to pay for anything.

01:42:12.278 --> 01:42:15.289
As you know that we don't take any money,

01:42:15.489 --> 01:42:21.387
we don't have elaborate places, we are humble.

01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:36.291
So please make it a point to respect your Self-Realization.

01:42:41.441 --> 01:42:50.194
You don't have to pay, but you have to respect your Self-Realization

01:42:50.394 --> 01:42:54.533
and give little time to it.

01:43:01.876 --> 01:43:07.915
If you have any problems, they can be solved in the collective.

01:43:11.277 --> 01:43:15.311
Also they will tell you all about how to meditate,

01:43:15.511 --> 01:43:19.527
hardly for ten minutes everyday.

01:43:24.371 --> 01:43:29.100
Gradually you will come to know everything and within one month time,

01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:33.082
you can become a master of Sahaja Yoga.

01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:43.408
You will have powers to raise the Kundalini of others.

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:50.167
You will have powers to cure others.

01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:59.621
There are so many powers of love and compassion and dynamism,

01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:09.580
that you will get the answer which science cannot give you,

01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:14.382
why are you on this Earth?

01:44:20.475 --> 01:44:24.971
Firstly you enter into the Kingdom of God

01:44:25.171 --> 01:44:31.249
and secondly to be the channel of this All-Pervading Power.

01:44:38.539 --> 01:44:43.495
This is for your benevolence, for the benevolence of your family,

01:44:43.695 --> 01:44:50.796
for the benevolence of your country and for the benevolence of the whole world.

01:44:57.481 --> 01:45:02.013
Thus we can create a very peaceful world.

01:45:05.091 --> 01:45:09.700
And this is the Truth you have been seeking.

01:45:13.239 --> 01:45:17.094
May God bless you all.

01:45:17.294 --> 01:45:21.896
Thank you very much.
