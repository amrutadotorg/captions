WEBVTT

01:20.200 --> 01:25.200
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:29.500 --> 01:35.200
At the very outset we have to remember

01:35.620 --> 01:42.100
that we are here to seek the truth.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.720
It´s not a sermon, is not a lecture,

01:51.880 --> 01:54.800
It´s not fundamentalism.

02:00.300 --> 02:03.740
I am happy to see that there are so many

02:03.920 --> 02:06.920
seekers in this country.

02:10.280 --> 02:13.400
Truth is what it is.

02:14.840 --> 02:18.000
You can not change it, you can not transform it.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.900
You can not read about it.

02:25.380 --> 02:28.300
You can not conceptualize it.

02:28.860 --> 02:31.800
You have to feel it, you have to become.

02:37.000 --> 02:42.080
I was also born in a protestant family in India.

02:46.260 --> 02:48.860
And that's how I know much more about Christianity

02:49.040 --> 02:52.000
that anyone of you can know.

02:56.380 --> 02:59.840
And I feel, we have missed the point.

03:02.320 --> 03:06.380
Because, because you can not seek

03:07.280 --> 03:10.200
Christianity

03:11.660 --> 03:14.880
and also truth.

03:20.560 --> 03:23.820
Christianity is very different from Christ.

03:26.360 --> 03:29.300
It´s absolutely mental.

03:31.620 --> 03:35.340
And specially, I  have attended Lutheran Church.

03:35.540 --> 03:38.400
[UNCLEAR]

03:38.600 --> 03:41.600
Lutheran Church.

03:42.940 --> 03:47.620
Of course, one has to understand

03:47.780 --> 03:51.260
that all these years our forefathers have been following

03:51.440 --> 03:54.400
Christianity.

03:59.080 --> 04:02.940
Especially in my country, they just came with the Bible in one hand

04:03.140 --> 04:07.600
and revolver in another. Cunning.

04:14.620 --> 04:18.500
And that kind of aggressiveness we see.

04:22.760 --> 04:24.820
Thank God Columbus

04:25.020 --> 04:27.880
luckily went to America, otherwise I would not have been here,

04:28.080 --> 04:31.000
no Indian would have been spared.

04:36.940 --> 04:40.380
You will be amazed that in Argentina and Chile,

04:40.880 --> 04:43.120
I have been to.

04:43.300 --> 04:49.440
You can't find a single aboriginal [UNCLEAR inhabitant], not one!

04:53.360 --> 04:57.380
You have to go to the museum to see them.

05:00.260 --> 05:03.200
Is that what Christ has taught us?

05:05.220 --> 05:08.200
He has said on the cross

05:08.400 --> 05:10.800
that, "Oh Father forgive them for they do not know,

05:10.980 --> 05:13.300
what they are doing."

05:21.260 --> 05:24.600
He never wanted any fundamentalism.

05:27.780 --> 05:35.600
He has said that those who are not against us are with us.

05:37.380 --> 05:42.600
People allowed him to live only for tree and the half year.

05:46.860 --> 05:51.100
Only that short period He had to talk to people.

05:54.360 --> 05:59.360
It is too short that people do. It is too short a time

05:59.540 --> 06:03.540
to talk to people about divinity about subtleties.

06:03.700 --> 06:07.100
Too short!

06:08.940 --> 06:14.000
Because people, people are so ignorant.

06:14.780 --> 06:19.500
And they live with that ignorance in sin.

06:21.220 --> 06:24.400
They belong to some Church, belong to some association,

06:24.580 --> 06:27.500
that's all!

06:31.080 --> 06:35.260
When I have been to London first, it took me four years

06:35.440 --> 06:38.900
to talk to people, seven people only, educate them.

06:39.080 --> 06:42.000
About Sahaja Yoga. Four years!

06:48.740 --> 06:53.100
I must say. English are hard nuts. No doubt.

06:53.280 --> 06:58.900
They are hard nuts. English are hard nuts, hard nuts.

07:01.140 --> 07:04.200
But, they opened themselves.

07:06.700 --> 07:10.240
Open to such an extend that today the best sahaja yogis

07:10.420 --> 07:14.400
we are having, are English.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.700
Because they realized,

07:24.040 --> 07:29.500
that we have to have something within us, which is universal.

07:33.420 --> 07:37.400
How can we fight in the name of God?

07:40.380 --> 07:44.000
When God has created all of us.

07:45.460 --> 07:48.400
How can we fight?

07:49.420 --> 07:54.820
It is surprising how everybody´s message has been so much been

07:54.980 --> 07:59.500
put into some sort of a mess.

08:04.580 --> 08:07.820
I have studied Bible and I realized

08:08.000 --> 08:12.700
that Paul had nothing to do with Christ!

08:19.640 --> 08:23.940
My father was a scholar and also a realized soul.

08:24.100 --> 08:27.800
I asked him, "What is this Paul doing here?"

08:31.500 --> 08:35.580
He said, he said that Paul,

08:35.740 --> 08:39.200
is a spotter.

08:45.300 --> 08:49.200
Firstly, he was suffering from epilepsy.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.640
Now we have proved that epilepsy comes to people

08:54.820 --> 08:57.800
when they are possessed.

08:59.920 --> 09:02.360
In India tree doctors have got MD (Doctor of Medicine)

09:02.540 --> 09:07.900
for curing people through Sahaja Yoga of incurable diseases.

09:14.340 --> 09:17.420
They have done MD.

09:17.620 --> 09:19.460
MD, Master.

09:19.640 --> 09:23.800
And one of them [UNCLEAR] in epilepsy.

09:25.740 --> 09:33.200
And he found that this epilepsy comes from possessions.

09:38.980 --> 09:44.600
And if the possession is removed, person can be cured.

09:48.960 --> 09:52.740
Thus with Sahaja Yoga people suffering from

09:52.920 --> 09:56.100
blood cancer have been cured.

09:59.600 --> 10:05.600
All kinds of incurable diseases had been cured automatically.

10:09.520 --> 10:12.500
By this happening.

10:17.160 --> 10:22.300
Christ has clearly said that you are to be born again.

10:25.860 --> 10:30.300
Even in Sanskrit, we call a realized soul as a "dwijha".

10:30.480 --> 10:33.400
The one who is born again.

10:35.920 --> 10:38.900
And,

10:39.680 --> 10:42.820
and even a bird is called "dwijha". It means the same.

10:43.020 --> 10:48.900
Bird born again, twice.Born twice. Born bird.

10:52.820 --> 10:56.260
Now, it is not just some priest puts water on your head

10:56.420 --> 10:59.800
and say you are born again.

11:02.880 --> 11:05.960
William Blake that great poet from England, has written a [UNCLEAR],

11:06.140 --> 11:09.800
Priest cursed on my fontanel area.

11:17.120 --> 11:21.200
But it is happening that has to take place.

11:23.200 --> 11:29.700
Like an egg becomes the bird, is a different personality.

11:29.880 --> 11:33.900
You have to get your transformation.

11:43.440 --> 11:44.800
That may be the reason,

11:44.960 --> 11:48.460
Christ has said in the second chapter, Mathew´s second verse,

11:48.640 --> 11:53.800
"You will be calling me Jesus, Jesus, I will not recognize you!"

12:02.080 --> 12:06.100
That's what exactly is the situation today.

12:10.060 --> 12:12.900
And also you can see, it´s very clear cut

12:13.080 --> 12:16.300
that you might be a Hindu, Christian, Muslim, anything.

12:16.480 --> 12:20.300
You can all commit any sin.

12:25.920 --> 12:29.400
You can do any harm to anyone.

12:33.140 --> 12:36.100
How can that be.

12:37.020 --> 12:40.000
There is no [UNCLEAR]

12:40.180 --> 12:42.660
from these [UNCLEAR brands]. These are [UNCLEAR brands].

12:42.840 --> 12:46.100
Artificially put on you.

12:50.980 --> 12:54.520
But if you are really a Christian,

12:54.700 --> 12:59.400
then the whole universe is yours.

13:03.880 --> 13:09.200
For, within  us lies the spirit. He said it so.

13:12.060 --> 13:16.500
And that you have to be the spirit, he said it so.

13:19.220 --> 13:21.240
Ones you become the spirit

13:21.420 --> 13:26.400
then there is complete transformation of personalities.

13:30.760 --> 13:33.540
I think, Christ has said quite a lot

13:33.720 --> 13:38.600
in this three and the half years of His public life.

13:41.920 --> 13:47.900
He has done so many things for us about, which we are not even aware.

13:51.460 --> 13:53.580
You will know, what he has done within ourselves,

13:53.760 --> 13:57.700
what he has created within ourselves.

14:02.000 --> 14:07.800
And you can only understand Christ if you get your self realization.

14:12.560 --> 14:15.760
We have now people who are Jews

14:15.960 --> 14:21.900
who are Muslims, Hindus all worship Christ.

14:28.600 --> 14:32.400
We are working in fifty-fife nations.

14:35.340 --> 14:36.860
Because,

14:37.040 --> 14:44.200
firstly, this Paul chose Peter, who was the worst disciple of Christ.

14:47.680 --> 14:52.800
Christ has said about him that a devil will take over.

14:52.980 --> 14:57.500
"Satan, Satan will take over you." Christ said.

15:02.280 --> 15:06.260
So he put in the name of Peter

15:06.440 --> 15:08.560
that Christ has said

15:08.760 --> 15:12.960
that you will build a temple or a church in his name

15:13.140 --> 15:16.360
and he will give you the keys.

15:16.560 --> 15:19.500
He gives you the keys to Peter.

15:30.380 --> 15:33.300
How can that be?

15:33.580 --> 15:35.660
The disciple, who was the worst of all,

15:36.020 --> 15:39.500
how can he make the head of Church?

15:43.320 --> 15:46.300
There is no logic.

15:48.020 --> 15:52.060
Then also, this organization that started

15:52.240 --> 15:57.200
became power oriented and money oriented.

16:03.220 --> 16:08.220
This power is worldly power, is what for Christ?

16:08.400 --> 16:13.300
What is the value of this worldly power to him?

16:18.740 --> 16:21.820
And what is this money after which

16:21.980 --> 16:27.100
these churches and these temples and all these people are running?

16:32.720 --> 16:37.800
Very surprising that these false people are now becoming

16:37.980 --> 16:41.500
much more experts in falsehood.

16:47.140 --> 16:49.880
Like in Orthodox Church now in Russia,

16:50.020 --> 16:53.740
one of the politician told me that there is vacuum.

16:53.920 --> 16:56.600
And then this Church is,

16:56.780 --> 17:00.920
what you call a Black Order, that Church, that big Orthodox.

17:01.100 --> 17:05.400
They are making all women nude and putting them in some sort of a

17:05.580 --> 17:08.800
pond to baptize.

17:20.560 --> 17:27.400
If you are a seeker of truth, you are born in the right moment.

17:31.360 --> 17:36.880
All the seekers of truth think that there is something bigger

17:37.080 --> 17:40.300
beyond us.

17:45.500 --> 17:48.860
They also react to falsehood.

17:49.040 --> 17:52.300
They also react to falsehood.

17:55.280 --> 17:58.900
But their faith is very much shattered.

18:02.360 --> 18:05.740
So they need something like "Hippiesm", this, that, agriculture,

18:05.900 --> 18:10.200
all kind of things. But that's not the way.

18:14.800 --> 18:18.180
They took to drugs and then to

18:18.360 --> 18:21.300
other things.

18:23.660 --> 18:28.500
Then in the west intellectuals like Fraud came in.

18:32.000 --> 18:35.620
In that Christian countries.

18:35.820 --> 18:39.100
How could they tolerate Freud?

18:44.320 --> 18:46.600
If he had come to India,

18:46.780 --> 18:48.600
I don´t know, where he would have landed, poor man,

18:48.760 --> 18:53.000
[UNCLEAR he could have... they would have  killed immediately.]

18:57.960 --> 19:00.440
He, I've been telling about him.

19:00.620 --> 19:04.120
Recently, I've seen a very beautiful book written by

19:04.300 --> 19:09.700
an American doctor. Calls it Fraudulent Fraud.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.800
[Might be Freudian Fraud by E. Fuller]

19:15.480 --> 19:18.800
Freud became Christ for people.

19:22.880 --> 19:26.660
For, I was told for thirty fife years people were fighting

19:26.840 --> 19:29.400
to become nude.

19:35.740 --> 19:38.860
May be, may be be for the higher race, I do not know

19:39.020 --> 19:42.400
but for us Indians, it is stupid.

19:52.360 --> 19:56.560
Christ has said, "Thou should not have adulterous eyes!''

19:56.740 --> 20:00.400
To such a subtle morality, he has got.

20:04.500 --> 20:07.240
That in your eyes, there should not bee lust and greed,

20:07.420 --> 20:10.400
that's what He said.

20:15.200 --> 20:17.180
When I first came in England,

20:17.360 --> 20:19.460
I was surprised, everybody is looking at everyone

20:19.640 --> 20:22.600
and I didn't know what they are doing what are they up to?

20:31.420 --> 20:35.400
So I asked [UNCLEAR her], yes, ''What are they doing?''

20:36.560 --> 20:39.800
She said, ''This is flirting''.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.060
I said but what's the use?

20:46.240 --> 20:48.100
Looking at some women, who is not your wife?

20:48.280 --> 20:51.600
What's the use? I do not understand logically.

20:57.440 --> 21:00.600
May be we Indians are not so intelligent.

21:05.480 --> 21:07.020
So the second shock comes,

21:07.200 --> 21:10.300
your faith is challenged by these people like Freud.

21:10.500 --> 21:13.800
Take out yearns out of their heads.

21:21.180 --> 21:24.600
In this book Freudian Fraud, he has given the names

21:24.780 --> 21:31.480
of so many scientists who have proved that he was,

21:31.680 --> 21:34.540
he had no scientific proof of  psychoanalysis

21:34.720 --> 21:37.700
and for [UNCLEAR dispensaries].

21:48.500 --> 21:53.800
And he said, nobody will publish their papers.

22:00.980 --> 22:04.500
Now in his book he has proved absolutely that

22:04.660 --> 22:09.820
it has nothing to do with mother and child and the child´s behavior,

22:10.000 --> 22:13.000
nothing of the kind.

22:22.880 --> 22:26.760
So now, we are at a juncture to see

22:26.920 --> 22:33.300
what is our goal.

22:37.680 --> 22:40.600
What do we have to achieve.

22:42.500 --> 22:45.960
Are we going to do, be just calling Jesus, Jesus?

22:46.140 --> 22:49.900
Or we are going to know him actually!

22:56.580 --> 23:00.740
Now, there is a way within us, this, this is the [UNCLEAR] of tree of life

23:00.940 --> 23:03.900
which is describe in the Bible.

23:07.000 --> 23:10.200
And also it is said that I will  appear before you

23:10.360 --> 23:15.380
like tongues of flames.

23:19.220 --> 23:22.600
And when you get your self realization, you see these centers,

23:22.780 --> 23:25.620
these chakras really as tongues of flames.

23:25.780 --> 23:29.200
Really you see them within yourself.

23:35.220 --> 23:38.800
But we have no self knowledge.

23:40.380 --> 23:43.500
We have to be humble about it.

23:45.660 --> 23:50.300
All the world problems are from human beings.

23:52.980 --> 23:55.340
And all human problems are because of their,

23:55.500 --> 23:59.460
these fundamental centers.

24:03.060 --> 24:07.900
Now, if you can somehow correct these centers within yourself

24:08.080 --> 24:12.820
and get connected with the all pervading power of God Almighty

24:13.000 --> 24:16.500
then there is no problem.

24:21.640 --> 24:24.660
That way atheist are better, atheist are better.

24:24.840 --> 24:28.400
Like Russians. Because they have no conditionings.

24:28.560 --> 24:31.500
They are free people, they are free people.

24:37.280 --> 24:39.800
So now these centers reside within you

24:39.920 --> 24:41.560
and whatever I am telling you,

24:41.720 --> 24:45.900
you should not also believe me blindfolded.

24:52.600 --> 24:56.200
But feel all this as

24:56.940 --> 25:00.000
say a hypothesis.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.460
And if it is proved

25:06.660 --> 25:11.800
then as honest people, you should accept it.

25:16.740 --> 25:19.900
Because it is not only for

25:20.060 --> 25:25.500
your benevolence but it is for the benevolence of the whole world.

25:30.100 --> 25:31.560
Also the third

25:31.720 --> 25:36.800
problem is that lot's of false people have come from India.

25:40.220 --> 25:43.400
They are also money oriented.

25:45.780 --> 25:48.800
We have now this Hare Ramas.

25:50.840 --> 25:54.580
In India everybody says that,

25:54.700 --> 25:57.700
so what.

25:59.940 --> 26:02.800
But I asked the people in India, who are supporting them.

26:02.960 --> 26:07.800
Why are you supporting these people, which is all false?

26:12.800 --> 26:14.340
They are fundamentalist.

26:14.500 --> 26:18.580
They said that while they converted us to Christianity,

26:18.740 --> 26:22.300
so we want to convert them to Hinduism.

26:35.220 --> 26:38.600
I said some donkeys were first converted as donkeys

26:38.760 --> 26:43.500
and now some donkeys again are going converted as donkeys.

26:48.640 --> 26:53.300
By changing these brands, are we going to achieve it?

26:58.060 --> 27:02.600
But they don´t think about the whole world of totality.

27:02.780 --> 27:06.900
They think about themselves. They think they are the best.

27:14.460 --> 27:17.500
They all think they are the best.

27:18.580 --> 27:23.800
If you have to ask about the Jews go and ask a Christian.

27:26.120 --> 27:30.800
And if you want to know about the Christian, go and ask Muslim.

27:33.240 --> 27:34.720
And you ask a Muslim

27:34.900 --> 27:39.700
then he will tell you to  interview about the Muslim.

27:42.320 --> 27:45.300
Ask me about Hindu.

27:45.920 --> 27:48.440
One better then the other.

27:48.780 --> 27:54.300
There is no religion, there is no God within them.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.100
They are all fighting cocks.

28:02.660 --> 28:06.500
Want to find out some way of fight.

28:09.420 --> 28:13.700
They talk of peace without having peace within.

28:15.860 --> 28:19.900
They have to find their peace within themselves.

28:21.640 --> 28:28.100
Now, so when this Kundalini, which is your own mother,

28:28.280 --> 28:32.300
everybody has their individual mother.

28:38.300 --> 28:42.000
And she gives you your second birth.

28:45.280 --> 28:48.380
There is another problem, which I face always

28:48.560 --> 28:51.140
that most of the western  people think

28:51.340 --> 28:55.100
that Christ was born in England.

28:58.720 --> 29:01.700
In England lived.

29:04.920 --> 29:09.700
He was blond, white, maybe from Helsinki.

29:14.180 --> 29:18.240
Because any knowledge coming from India, they want to abhor.

29:20.300 --> 29:25.800
They want to oppose all knowledge that comes from  India or East.

29:34.080 --> 29:39.400
I agree that western civilization has grown like a big tree.

29:44.500 --> 29:48.100
But it does not know its roots.

29:49.160 --> 29:52.400
Even Christ went to India.

29:54.060 --> 29:55.420
And you will be amazed

29:55.600 --> 29:58.420
that one of my forefathers from long time back,

29:58.600 --> 30:02.820
he was a king of a country, Shalivahana.

30:03.000 --> 30:07.500
He asked Christ, he met Christ in Kashmir.

30:17.020 --> 30:19.740
In the, in the historical,

30:19.920 --> 30:22.300
I mean whatever they have, written down is there.

30:22.480 --> 30:26.200
He asked, "What´s your name?"

30:27.640 --> 30:31.300
He said, "My name is Issah."

30:35.040 --> 30:39.100
So, he said, "Are you a foreigner?"

30:43.320 --> 30:48.400
He said, "I am not in this country."

30:50.640 --> 30:55.200
"But in my country I am a foreigner."

31:00.120 --> 31:03.200
"They can not understand me."

31:06.820 --> 31:10.440
Also His mother died in India.

31:11.500 --> 31:14.500
They [UNCLEAR] the anger of this  people.

31:14.680 --> 31:16.740
You know, they were very angry in there for nothing at all.

31:16.900 --> 31:20.600
I don´t know, it was off their heads.

31:25.220 --> 31:28.200
Very angry people.

31:29.840 --> 31:32.560
Always!

31:32.720 --> 31:35.000
I have a diplomatic passport, but still they were

31:35.180 --> 31:38.600
very hot-tempered, angry people.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.520
I told out the sahaja yogis, see now,

31:45.680 --> 31:49.000
you will see their temper as they will see me.

31:53.760 --> 31:56.700
Temper can not be Godly.

32:00.480 --> 32:04.720
Fine, so now, here are these centers and

32:04.900 --> 32:09.140
when this Kundalini rises, she nourishes all these centers,

32:09.620 --> 32:13.320
passes through that crossing point, where resides Christ,

32:13.500 --> 32:16.500
on the optic chiasma.

32:25.260 --> 32:28.200
He is a gate.

32:32.440 --> 32:35.860
And when the Kundalini awakens him,

32:36.020 --> 32:39.340
he sucks in these two institutions, which are form

32:39.500 --> 32:42.400
by these two channels, ego and superego,

32:42.600 --> 32:46.000
you can call ego and conditionings.

32:56.560 --> 33:00.540
That is, he died for our sins.

33:00.720 --> 33:05.600
That is what it is. We should explain, he died for our sins.

33:09.780 --> 33:15.600
Because he sucks in all the karmas, all the bad [UNCLEAR] sucks.

33:19.660 --> 33:23.440
And also sucks whatever

33:23.620 --> 33:27.300
what is our conditionings.

33:30.940 --> 33:37.000
Then by that sucking the top of the fontanel opens out.

33:42.600 --> 33:46.800
And a cool breeze starts coming in.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.600
From your being.

33:52.500 --> 33:56.240
Also you can feel all over this cool breeze

33:56.420 --> 34:04.000
which is a Holy Ghost her power of love.

34:08.280 --> 34:13.300
Now about Holy Ghost is another [UNCLEAR].

34:16.700 --> 34:20.980
This Archbishop of Canterbury was asked who is the Holy Ghost?

34:21.140 --> 34:25.000
By somebody on the telly, there I saw it myself.

34:30.680 --> 34:32.480
Robin Day, [UNCLEAR] .

34:32.660 --> 34:36.200
he was [UNCLEAR] interviewed by Robin Day, like a bulldog.

34:36.380 --> 34:43.200
Robin Day. And he said that I am a Gnostic.

34:43.460 --> 34:47.500
Archbishop of Canterbury said, "I am a Gnostic."

34:54.060 --> 34:57.520
A Gnostic means.... You said unknowledgeable.

34:57.680 --> 35:02.400
Archbishop said. I watched it myself on the television.

35:05.720 --> 35:10.100
He said, "I don´t know. I don´t know."

35:11.260 --> 35:14.840
Then the Archbishop told this men, "I don ´t know, I am Gnostic."

35:15.020 --> 35:18.100
It means, I don´t know, I am not knowledgeable.

35:24.840 --> 35:26.740
So this interviewer, quite a good man,

35:26.920 --> 35:30.000
he asked him " And what are you doing here?"

35:34.000 --> 35:37.800
He said, "I am doing my job as you are doing your job."

35:42.060 --> 35:46.300
Christ´s first disciples were Gnostics.

35:50.640 --> 35:56.500
Gn comes from the word, in sanskrit gn is knowledge.

36:00.260 --> 36:05.220
It is not mental knowledge. It is not bookish knowledge.

36:05.420 --> 36:08.600
But knowledge where you evolve

36:08.800 --> 36:13.900
and you can feel this all-pervading power.

36:20.320 --> 36:25.900
So, who is the [UNCLEAR], who is this Holy Ghost?

36:27.820 --> 36:31.920
They have the Father and the Son.

36:32.100 --> 36:35.500
And the dove as the Holy Ghost.

36:36.760 --> 36:40.600
Dove, dove.It´s the white bird, I think.

36:47.800 --> 36:50.800
Why not The Mother?

36:53.060 --> 36:56.500
Because Paul hated women.

37:00.580 --> 37:02.600
Big problem these days for Christians,

37:02.760 --> 37:06.500
how to appoint a woman as a priest.

37:11.140 --> 37:14.100
Biggest problem!

37:15.720 --> 37:18.900
Because of Mister Paul.

37:21.020 --> 37:26.300
This Primordial Mother is the feminine mother within you.

37:30.760 --> 37:36.060
She is the reflection of the Holy Ghost of the Primordial Mother.

37:42.240 --> 37:45.540
Greeks are much better. They called her Athena, the Primordial Mother.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.000
Atha means primordial in Sanskrit.

37:52.420 --> 37:56.600
I also saw her name here. I directly saw her.

37:58.640 --> 38:03.500
Of course, we call her Adi Shakti. It´s the primordial power.

38:07.600 --> 38:12.500
She is the power of desire of God Almighty.

38:17.120 --> 38:24.200
She creates the whole universe and God Almighty is the witness.

38:29.980 --> 38:33.420
Later on you hear lot about Christ, how big he was.

38:33.600 --> 38:38.500
What was before his birth, who was he.

38:44.440 --> 38:48.780
In our scriptures the Goddess it´s alright

38:48.960 --> 38:51.540
but Christians won´t see. They have blinkers here.

38:51.700 --> 38:55.500
They have not supposed to see anything else but Bible.

39:03.620 --> 39:08.700
Thank God my mother and father both were scholars of Sanskrit.

39:15.700 --> 39:20.960
This Kundalini raises, pierces through this fontanel bone area

39:21.140 --> 39:24.740
and she nourishes all these centers on here.

39:24.900 --> 39:28.000
Because she is the vital force.

39:38.880 --> 39:43.660
As this instrument has to be connected to the mains,

39:43.840 --> 39:48.800
in the same way, we are to be connected to the mains.

39:59.060 --> 40:06.300
So, this Kundalini is also the pure desire, our pure desire.

40:09.380 --> 40:11.940
Now, when these centers go out of order,

40:12.120 --> 40:15.800
they are formed by left and right sympathetic

40:23.740 --> 40:27.100
and the parasympathetic in the center.

40:28.800 --> 40:33.200
When you start using this power, they get constricted.

40:33.360 --> 40:36.300
These centers become constricted.

40:39.200 --> 40:43.200
And their energy is exhausted.

40:46.280 --> 40:48.260
And all these viruses come from the left.

40:48.420 --> 40:50.720
All the viruses come from the left side.

40:50.880 --> 40:54.800
From the subconscious, from the collective subconscious.

40:58.380 --> 41:01.980
So, sometimes when they break,

41:02.160 --> 41:07.700
this starts working on its own. This side.

41:12.080 --> 41:15.620
All these incurable diseases are [UNCLEAR]

41:15.800 --> 41:20.200
of the left side attack of the viruses.

41:25.580 --> 41:29.200
And these viruses are

41:29.380 --> 41:33.060
the animals, the plants and human beings,

41:33.240 --> 41:38.100
who have gone into the collective subconscious.

41:45.840 --> 41:50.520
Of course now, doctors have reached up to a point to say

41:50.680 --> 41:55.280
that these viruses come from the area

41:55.460 --> 41:59.860
which is build within us since our creation.

42:00.040 --> 42:03.000
Since the creation.

42:13.020 --> 42:18.460
For cancer they have viruses with the over 53 above [UNCLEAR] like that,

42:18.620 --> 42:20.880
they have numbers.

42:21.040 --> 42:23.340
That´s all. They are only numbers, I think.

42:23.520 --> 42:27.600
But they are honest, because they don´t know anything more.

42:37.820 --> 42:40.500
So the left side are emotional problems,

42:40.680 --> 42:44.720
the right side are our physical and mental problems

42:44.900 --> 42:49.300
and center ones are our spiritual problems.

43:00.660 --> 43:03.600
If these problems can be solved

43:06.560 --> 43:11.300
and if you are all connected to this power

43:13.200 --> 43:16.500
then there is no question

43:19.020 --> 43:23.100
of having any problems whatsoever.

43:25.320 --> 43:29.620
Then you realize that all those religions that we know of,

43:29.800 --> 43:33.900
were created on the same tree of life.

43:37.900 --> 43:41.300
The tree of spirituality.

43:42.100 --> 43:48.240
But we pluck the flowers and say, this is mine, this is mine.

43:48.420 --> 43:51.700
Fighting with the death flowers.

43:59.940 --> 44:04.640
All the incarnations, all the prophets,

44:04.840 --> 44:07.140
all the seers

44:07.420 --> 44:12.500
are on the same frequency.

44:17.180 --> 44:22.600
Then we realize that there is universal religion within us.

44:27.660 --> 44:30.980
Because the spirit that is reflected in our heart,

44:31.160 --> 44:34.900
is the reflection of God Almighty.

44:40.720 --> 44:45.700
And this spirit is a universal being.

44:47.380 --> 44:52.680
You will be amazed to know that we have 55 nations

44:52.860 --> 44:56.900
who are working out Sahaja Yoga.

45:01.240 --> 45:04.580
Also in Russia, we had people,

45:04.760 --> 45:08.900
sixteen thousand, twenty two thousand.

45:12.860 --> 45:16.300
And all of them got realization.

45:18.740 --> 45:21.700
So, what you find

45:21.880 --> 45:25.620
that people from all these countries,

45:25.800 --> 45:29.800
how there are unition.

45:36.380 --> 45:39.440
There is no fight, there is no argument,

45:39.620 --> 45:43.000
just they enjoy each other.

45:48.980 --> 45:51.400
And they talk the language

45:51.580 --> 45:56.400
of chakras, centers.

45:58.740 --> 46:02.060
They do not talk Latina and this and that

46:02.240 --> 46:07.900
as we think that these disciples of Christ did. They did not.

46:12.020 --> 46:15.560
When they got realization, they started talking

46:15.740 --> 46:19.000
the language of the centers.

46:24.220 --> 46:27.700
Now, if this center is catching

46:27.860 --> 46:32.600
that means, one has terrible ego.

46:38.400 --> 46:42.200
That is the center of Christ.

46:44.680 --> 46:49.600
And surprisingly, Christians have the worst of this.

46:56.020 --> 46:58.620
So, the person who will come and tell me,

46:58.800 --> 47:01.040
Mother my Agnya chakra is catching,

47:01.200 --> 47:05.100
meaning, I have a ego a terrible ego.

47:13.380 --> 47:16.300
Normally nobody would do it.

47:17.800 --> 47:20.120
They would never say, I have got terrible ego,

47:20.280 --> 47:23.200
nobody would say like that.

47:27.020 --> 47:31.900
Or else, you become, your awareness becomes

47:32.060 --> 47:35.400
collectively conscious.

47:40.180 --> 47:43.200
This is your evolution.

47:44.260 --> 47:49.900
You evolve into a higher state of awareness.

47:52.320 --> 47:56.900
You can feel it on your fingertips.

47:57.780 --> 48:04.460
The diseases of other people, the problems of other people.

48:04.640 --> 48:07.120
I have shown you, you can see clearly, these are the centers.

48:07.280 --> 48:11.000
Denoted on the left, same on the right.

48:15.080 --> 48:19.300
Today I met in the morning a very great scientist from Russia.

48:19.480 --> 48:25.300
And I told him that Sahaja Yoga is metascience, above science.

48:32.840 --> 48:35.680
He said how? I said see, with my fingers

48:35.860 --> 48:39.500
I can say what this man is suffering from.

48:44.660 --> 48:47.240
But before diagnoses only, the doctors will kill you

48:47.440 --> 48:50.600
before diagnoses, you know they will.

48:54.600 --> 48:59.360
And surprisingly Mohamed Sahib said in his Koran

48:59.540 --> 49:04.380
that at the time of resurrection, Qiyama, your hands will speak

49:04.560 --> 49:08.000
and will give witness against you.

49:18.700 --> 49:20.980
But Muslims never want to talk of Qiyama.

49:21.140 --> 49:24.500
They do not want to talk of resurrection.

49:27.980 --> 49:32.980
Because when he said, "I am the seal.", means a stamp of a prophet.

49:33.160 --> 49:36.900
They want to say seal, [UNCLEAR it means] seal off.

49:46.960 --> 49:53.800
Then how did he talk of Qiyama? How did he talk of Qiyama?

49:59.780 --> 50:04.500
But Muslims are very much away from Mohammed Saab.

50:06.640 --> 50:12.400
At least their intellectuals say that, they say that at least.

50:15.980 --> 50:20.060
So now whit these thinks that happens to you,

50:20.220 --> 50:24.300
you become collectively conscious.

50:27.740 --> 50:32.400
As if you become part and parcel of the whole.

50:35.120 --> 50:39.600
The microcosm becomes the macrocosm.

50:42.740 --> 50:45.700
So who is the other?

50:49.440 --> 50:52.400
Then what is there to fight?

50:53.760 --> 50:57.620
The spirit is the source of

50:57.800 --> 51:02.900
pure knowledge and truth.

51:06.380 --> 51:09.300
Absolute knowledge.

51:10.260 --> 51:15.760
So, when you put your fingers, hands like this,

51:15.940 --> 51:19.740
you get the all the messages through this all pervading power

51:20.300 --> 51:23.300
and you know the absolute thing.

51:33.460 --> 51:38.580
And when you get the absolute truth, if everybody feels the same way,

51:38.760 --> 51:42.400
what is there to fight and quarrel?

51:49.000 --> 51:52.600
Even the small children know.

51:54.740 --> 51:57.660
Now there is a supposing false person has come.

51:57.820 --> 52:00.820
How will you recognize?

52:01.000 --> 52:03.900
If some false man comes here, I say that`s Jesus.

52:04.080 --> 52:07.000
How will you recognize?

52:13.100 --> 52:16.600
Ask him to walk on the water?

52:19.200 --> 52:21.100
That simply best.

52:21.300 --> 52:23.940
But, if you have vibrations,

52:24.120 --> 52:28.900
you can make up each and every person.

52:38.400 --> 52:44.200
Because this power is the power of love.

52:47.160 --> 52:50.100
Of pure love.

52:50.500 --> 52:54.000
We have never used this power.

52:55.660 --> 52:59.500
Even in religion we have not used.

53:00.640 --> 53:04.400
We have used the power of hatred.

53:06.100 --> 53:09.380
So, once you get this power flow through you,

53:09.560 --> 53:15.600
you become empowered yourself, you can give realizations to others.

53:24.620 --> 53:28.400
You can cure people.

53:29.920 --> 53:34.800
And this power is the ocean of knowledge.

53:38.180 --> 53:42.000
Of pure divine knowledge.

53:43.060 --> 53:47.560
Then you understand Bible better, then you understand Christ better,

53:47.740 --> 53:51.400
then you understand all of them.

53:54.500 --> 53:58.100
Our subtle eyes have to be opened.

54:00.240 --> 54:03.300
But if you are satisfied with your ignorance,

54:03.460 --> 54:06.400
nobody can force you.

54:10.340 --> 54:15.300
Unless and until you ask for it, it won´t work out.

54:18.800 --> 54:24.540
Christ has said, "The meek will inherit the Earth."

54:24.720 --> 54:28.280
The meek. The meek people, it means humble.

54:28.460 --> 54:31.700
Meek will inherit the earth.

54:34.880 --> 54:38.180
So, only those who are humble will get realization.

54:38.360 --> 54:42.200
Those who are arrogant can never get it.

54:47.140 --> 54:52.500
This is not meant for arrogant, not meant for stupid people.

54:54.620 --> 54:57.600
Or slavish.

54:59.960 --> 55:04.000
We do not know how much slavery we have.

55:07.360 --> 55:11.000
The entrepreneurs has made up slaves.

55:15.420 --> 55:18.140
If they say [UNCLEAR] wear a six inches of skirt,

55:18.320 --> 55:21.020
all the ladies would  [UNCLEAR built ] the six inches of skirt,

55:21.200 --> 55:24.200
[UNCLEAR whether/ weather]  is cold or not.

55:28.820 --> 55:31.960
We have no self esteem, I would say,

55:32.140 --> 55:34.300
or we do not have our own personality

55:34.460 --> 55:38.100
to check why you to wear this nonsense?

55:46.400 --> 55:50.280
We have given up all those so many good  traditions,

55:50.440 --> 55:53.260
just out of this people

55:53.420 --> 55:56.940
bombarding your heads with publicity and all that.

55:57.120 --> 56:06.240
[Shri Mataji is explaining to the translator]

56:18.240 --> 56:22.200
I hope, you all get your realization today.

56:24.120 --> 56:27.660
It is sahaja. It is sahaja.

56:27.820 --> 56:33.500
Sahaja means born with ,saha means with,[UNCLEAR] is born.

56:36.680 --> 56:39.900
It is spontaneous.

56:41.060 --> 56:46.000
We have flowers here, see what a miracle they are.

56:49.440 --> 56:52.400
Our eyes, what a miracle.

56:53.360 --> 56:57.700
We take everything for granted.

56:58.640 --> 57:02.500
These have came out spontaneously.

57:04.040 --> 57:07.620
In the same way this works, this is evolutionary process.

57:07.800 --> 57:12.000
The last breakthrough which is spontaneous.

57:19.860 --> 57:26.300
It is absolutely spontaneous and it is your own.

57:30.100 --> 57:35.200
This divinity is all the time within yourself in the potential state.

57:35.380 --> 57:38.300
It is all the time in there.

57:41.900 --> 57:44.900
Because it is eternal.

57:46.100 --> 57:47.480
Whatever you might have done,

57:47.640 --> 57:51.900
it can not be tarnished, it can not be destroyed.

57:56.280 --> 57:59.060
It´s all your own.

57:59.240 --> 58:03.200
It`s all your own.

58:04.380 --> 58:07.420
Like a seed has it`s primula,

58:07.580 --> 58:11.700
in the same way you have this Kundalini within.

58:12.280 --> 58:15.200
Seed has its blooms.

58:21.440 --> 58:24.400
And it works.

58:26.840 --> 58:29.560
It has worked for thousands

58:29.740 --> 58:32.800
and it should work for you also.

58:37.200 --> 58:41.000
But these are special times.

58:43.140 --> 58:46.100
I call it a blossom time.

58:48.740 --> 58:52.100
But this is the last judgment.

58:53.800 --> 58:56.280
It´s nonsense to say that when you will die

58:56.440 --> 58:58.820
and then you will come and you will be judged.

58:59.000 --> 59:03.000
What your bones would be there?

59:08.840 --> 59:12.500
Just discussions, discussions, discussions.

59:13.960 --> 59:16.900
Just empty words.

59:19.720 --> 59:26.100
So, this spontaneous happening has to work out within you.

59:30.940 --> 59:34.200
If it works out,

59:34.680 --> 59:39.400
then you have to see that the connection is established.

59:44.120 --> 59:50.500
For this living process, you cant´t pay, you cant´t pay!

59:53.520 --> 59:59.300
How much do we pay to mother earth, when she gives us flowers?

01:00:03.200 --> 01:00:07.500
It is all built in within you. It is built in.

01:00:10.780 --> 01:00:15.900
And it will work out, I am sure, tonight.

01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:24.100
I know some of you have some questions. I can see.

01:00:28.120 --> 01:00:32.800
I´ll become quite an expert in answering all kinds of questions.

01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:41.900
But that´s a mental acrobats. Why do you want to?

01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:48.200
Why don´t have your realization?

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.900
See in this beautiful hall, we have these lights.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:00.460
And if you want to put the light, you will say alright,

01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:05.000
there is a switch, you press it and all the lights will come.

01:01:09.020 --> 01:01:12.500
Because it is all built in!

01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:15.120
First supposing I have to tell you

01:01:15.260 --> 01:01:18.400
the history of electricity and then how it came here,

01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.900
where is [UNCLEAR], where is hole, you will be [UNCLEAR bored of].

01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.940
I don´t know in English language,

01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:35.400
must have given at-least 4 to 5 thousands lectures.

01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:43.300
Apart from other, other languages.

01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:49.000
So far, I have not written any book as such.

01:01:51.860 --> 01:01:57.500
Because again they would say, Mother say so. You see another....

01:02:04.820 --> 01:02:11.400
So, best is for your-self, you get your realization.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:17.400
And if you have any questions, you can write them down

01:02:17.580 --> 01:02:21.040
and let us know, we´ll answer them in [UNCLEAR].

01:02:30.660 --> 01:02:32.580
Seeker asks: What is the practice about?

01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:35.920
That´s what I am going to do, you are the seeker, I was [UNCLEAR]!

01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:37.380
That´s it!

01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:41.660
That´s what and then what you preach you can practice.

01:02:41.820 --> 01:02:44.500
That´s happen. Very good. Such a intelligent!

01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:46.860
He told me that you are some clear seekers. He told me so.

01:02:47.020 --> 01:02:50.000
I was very happy.

01:03:08.220 --> 01:03:14.880
As it is, I have told you that if you asked for it,

01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:18.500
it´s your own, you will get it.

01:03:25.020 --> 01:03:28.200
But I cannot force it on you.

01:03:32.300 --> 01:03:35.300
I respect your freedom.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:39.900
Because ultimately, you have to have complete freedom.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.160
You´ll be amazed, over night people have dropped their drugs.

01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:51.500
Alcoholism. Over night!

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.500
In the place like London.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:00.900
Which is a difficult place.

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:06.700
But now they are very different.

01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:08.500
You have got some of them in here now.

01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:12.800
They have come from England also to help me.

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:24.700
Alright, this is a very nice encouraging  question. Alright,

01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.320
so now are you all prepared to take your realization or not?

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:33.100
Those who do not want to have, should leave the hall.

01:04:43.260 --> 01:04:46.000
If you want to have your realization,

01:04:46.180 --> 01:04:51.100
you should know that it´s a very simple thing to do.

01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:58.660
But if you are complicated

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:03.200
then it takes time. But ultimately you get it.

01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:18.900
So, those who do not want, should leave the hall. Please, thank you.

01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:28.180
And you will have to do whatever I tell you because its not sitting

01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:33.800
to watch other people aaa like aaa…  .

01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:48.300
When they are meditating, they are going to work it out.

01:05:48.480 --> 01:05:54.700
I would request you to cooperate with everyone.

01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:07.800
But if you don´t want it, you can leave the hall.

01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:19.800
But please don´t disturb others by looking at others.

01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:26.500
Now whatever I will be suggesting,

01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:29.620
whatever I will be suggesting now,

01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:32.920
whatever I will be now... you need not...,

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.900
you need not do it.

01:06:49.040 --> 01:06:52.000
So what is it?

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:59.220
Of course, but we get over karmas. Very good question.

01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:00.560
Karmas are there.

01:07:00.760 --> 01:07:05.000
Only human beings have karmas because of their ego.

01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:15.700
Animals don´t think that they are doing anything wrong,

01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:20.840
in anything whatever, because they are bound.

01:07:45.540 --> 01:07:49.400
And it is only the human beings because

01:07:49.600 --> 01:07:52.140
they think they are doing something,

01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:56.400
that´s why, because of the ego. I am doing.

01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:07.280
But after realization you don´t say I am doing something.

01:08:07.900 --> 01:08:09.420
You just say it is not going, it is not..,

01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:12.600
in third person you start talking.

01:08:21.900 --> 01:08:26.160
You just say it is going, it is working, it is happening.

01:08:26.340 --> 01:08:31.000
You don´t say I am doing, I. I disappears.

01:08:41.620 --> 01:08:46.600
I have already told you that Christ sucks in all our karmas.

01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:57.700
What is the second (question)?

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:09.500
Diet is that there is nothing isms’ since Sahaja Yoga.

01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:19.140
Of course, one should not eat animals which are bigger than them

01:09:19.360 --> 01:09:23.600
like horses or mules or something.

01:09:26.660 --> 01:09:32.200
Because they spoil the teeth. Their muscles spoil the teeth.

01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:40.660
Those who need more protein should have more proteins,

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:43.300
those who need more carbohydrates

01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:46.600
should have more carbohydrates.

01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:56.920
What is the use of saving the chickens.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.700
I can’t give them realization, can I?

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:16.620
It´s as simple as that.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:18.800
Alright.

01:10:18.980 --> 01:10:21.600
This is another fad.

01:10:21.780 --> 01:10:25.100
Vegetarianism , another fad.

01:10:27.940 --> 01:10:32.500
It may suit in the west because they have bad livers.

01:10:38.440 --> 01:10:40.760
And they have taken too much of food, I think.

01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:45.640
They have taken to much of this meets and thing so...to much of...

01:10:45.820 --> 01:10:48.800
Animals!

01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:58.500
So, you have to understand later on

01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:02.100
what you have to eat. That´s all.

01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:08.400
And they will give you full idea about.

01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:14.940
Lastly, before we start, I have to tell you one thing

01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:20.500
that Sahaja Yoga is a collective happening.

01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:28.540
Today you will get your realization

01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:31.900
and you will feel on top of the earth... world.

01:11:36.540 --> 01:11:41.600
But, you have to come to collective.

01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.580
So that in totality, in totality

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.960
you understand Sahaja Yoga,

01:11:53.480 --> 01:11:55.320
you master it

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.880
and that you all the time

01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:03.700
remain in the realm of Kingdom of God.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.440
It doesn´t take any much time.

01:12:13.600 --> 01:12:17.900
Sometimes I have seen in 8 days people have become masters.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:25.020
But

01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:28.060
you have to be collective

01:12:28.220 --> 01:12:33.200
because you must master it.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:43.200
You are the people who have to help your countrymen.

01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:53.300
And later on the whole world.

01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:03.700
John in his revelation has said only 44 000 will be realized souls.

01:13:14.140 --> 01:13:18.300
I think, he was...it must be something symbolic, he must have said.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.600
But we have many more than that.

01:13:25.980 --> 01:13:30.000
And we have to hope to have many more also.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:36.000
There are seekers and seekers.

01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:41.960
So another, one simple request, if you don´t mind very much

01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:44.220
because in the beginning English felt very bad

01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:48.300
when I told them to take out their shoes.

01:13:54.800 --> 01:13:58.060
Because this feet when they touch the ground,

01:13:58.260 --> 01:14:02.000
the  Mother earth sucks in all the problems.

01:14:17.740 --> 01:14:20.300
As I told you there is left and right side there,

01:14:20.480 --> 01:14:23.400
left and right side.

01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:29.320
And the left side is the power of ordinary desire.

01:14:40.340 --> 01:14:45.600
And the right side is the power of action.

01:14:48.160 --> 01:14:52.080
So, today only we have to do it, never again.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:57.500
Is to nourish our own centers ourselves.

01:15:06.160 --> 01:15:08.300
Some things are so short when you translate

01:15:08.500 --> 01:15:13.340
which are bigger, you [UNCLEAR] interesting.

01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:16.580
Alright [UNCLEAR].

01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:21.640
Alright, now these, put your left hand,

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:26.200
you have to be very comfortable first of all. Be comfortable.

01:15:33.840 --> 01:15:36.920
You don´t have to go to Himalayas to stand on your heads,

01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.000
nothing of the kind. Be very comfortable.

01:15:47.080 --> 01:15:50.720
Now the left hand is to be put properly like this.

01:15:50.900 --> 01:15:53.900
Good.

01:15:59.180 --> 01:16:00.900
Alright, now.

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:04.240
So, this is symbolic that you are desirous

01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.200
of having your self-realization, is symbolic.

01:16:13.260 --> 01:16:18.800
And the right hand is to be used for nourishing your centers.

01:16:22.380 --> 01:16:27.900
So first we put our right hand on our heart.

01:16:28.540 --> 01:16:31.400
If you are wearing a coat, it´s better to put inside.

01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.000
It´s alright. On the heart, lower , little lower is the heart.

01:16:40.180 --> 01:16:44.700
In the heart resides the spirit

01:16:46.580 --> 01:16:50.800
which is the reflection of God Almighty.

01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.240
Now,

01:16:55.440 --> 01:16:57.200
then,

01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.960
if you become the spirit,

01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:04.380
in the light of a spirit you become your own guide.

01:17:04.580 --> 01:17:08.100
You become your own master.

01:17:15.060 --> 01:17:17.380
So, please take your right hand

01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:20.040
in the upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

01:17:20.220 --> 01:17:23.800
We are working only on the left hand side.

01:17:29.700 --> 01:17:32.200
Now.

01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.200
This is the center of your mastery,

01:17:35.400 --> 01:17:39.900
created by all the great prophets.

01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:53.620
Now. Take your right hand in the lower portion of the abdomen

01:17:53.780 --> 01:17:56.700
on the left hand side.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.500
Push with your fingers. Push with your fingers.

01:18:04.840 --> 01:18:06.600
This is the center

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:12.100
of pure divine knowledge.

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:17.200
You will be amazed that it´s placed here.

01:18:20.880 --> 01:18:24.300
Later on you know everything.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:33.400
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:18:39.340 --> 01:18:45.600
Now place it on top of your heart again.

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.580
Now

01:18:49.780 --> 01:18:52.760
when we feel guilty,

01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:57.600
we create a very big problem for ourselves.

01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:05.600
If you might commit any mistake,

01:19:05.780 --> 01:19:09.200
you should face it and  finish it off.

01:19:12.820 --> 01:19:16.240
But when you feel guilty the center here on the left side

01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:20.000
gets completely blocked.

01:19:24.020 --> 01:19:26.860
And you get diseases like angina

01:19:27.060 --> 01:19:33.800
and...  What you call? Spondylitis or lethargic organs.

01:19:39.340 --> 01:19:42.180
So please put your right hand

01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:44.500
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:48.100
and turn your head to your right.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.600
Now.

01:19:59.780 --> 01:20:02.540
No use feel guilty now, as I told you.

01:20:02.740 --> 01:20:04.740
Moreover you are human beings and

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:09.300
only human beings can make mistakes, you are not Gods.

01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.980
So.

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:28.400
Then you have to know that you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:20:32.960 --> 01:20:36.920
For that you have to put your right hand on top of your forehead

01:20:37.100 --> 01:20:40.100
and put down the head.

01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:43.700
Forehead across.

01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:52.700
Logically, whether you forgive or don´t forgive,

01:20:52.900 --> 01:20:56.000
you don´t do anything.

01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:07.200
But if you don´t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

01:21:09.740 --> 01:21:12.640
And those who have troubled you

01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:17.100
are having a nice time.

01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.400
Moreover this center is very constricted.

01:21:24.600 --> 01:21:27.360
And if you do not forgive, it will never open

01:21:27.540 --> 01:21:31.800
and you miss your self-realization.

01:21:39.720 --> 01:21:42.580
Now please take your right hand on the back side of your head

01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:49.900
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:59.220
In this center without feeling guilty,

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:01.140
without  counting your mistakes,

01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:03.400
just for your satisfaction,

01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:09.000
you have to ask forgiveness from the all Divine Power.

01:22:17.660 --> 01:22:20.760
This is the Agnya chakra where Christ resides

01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:25.980
and in the Lord´s Prayer, he has said, "Forgive us our trespasses

01:22:26.140 --> 01:22:31.100
as we forgive them, those who trespass against us."

01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.840
Now stretch your palms fully.

01:22:46.020 --> 01:22:49.000
This is the last center.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:56.860
And put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area

01:22:57.060 --> 01:23:02.600
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.600
Now you please put down your head.

01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:20.500
And this time push back your fingers as far as possible

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.640
and have a good pressure on your scalp

01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:28.800
and move it 7 times clock wise.

01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:47.800
That´s it. That´s all we have to do. Now we have to close our eyes.

01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:55.800
Before that I will tell you, there are three conditions.

01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:01.400
Conditions.

01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:05.440
The first is that you should be all very confident

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:09.300
that you will all get your realization.

01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:14.860
That means, do not feel guilty,

01:24:15.060 --> 01:24:17.860
do not think you have done bad karmas , nothing of the kind.

01:24:18.040 --> 01:24:23.700
Forget it. At this moment you are absolutely alright.

01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:37.700
In short you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:24:43.400 --> 01:24:48.500
Now the second condition is,

01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.500
the third now, because the first is that you should be confident,

01:24:51.700 --> 01:24:56.480
second thing you should not feel guilty and the third one is

01:24:56.680 --> 01:25:01.200
that you have to forgive everyone.

01:25:05.260 --> 01:25:09.400
Don´t even have to think about it.

01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.700
Because it´s a headache.

01:25:18.460 --> 01:25:21.180
You have to just in general, you have to say later on

01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.700
when I tell you just to forgive everyone.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:34.360
Now you will have to put left hand like this

01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:38.820
with both of the  feet  apart from each other

01:25:39.040 --> 01:25:43.900
and put your right hand on your heart.

01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:52.720
Now if you are wearing glasses, you can take them out

01:25:52.900 --> 01:25:54.660
because now you have to close your eyes,

01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:58.460
till I tell you, don´t open them, please.

01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:08.200
So.

01:26:11.120 --> 01:26:14.300
Please close your eyes.

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:24.160
Now, here

01:26:24.340 --> 01:26:31.100
you have to ask me a fundamental question about yourself.

01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:39.300
You can call me mother or Shri Mataji.

01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:45.780
Now the question is, "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:26:45.960 --> 01:26:49.100
Ask this question three times.

01:27:04.800 --> 01:27:12.100
So if you are the spirit, you become your own master.

01:27:12.300 --> 01:27:14.540
So, please take your right hand

01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.400
in the upper portion of your abdomen on left hand side.

01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:31.800
Here ask another fundamental question.

01:27:33.340 --> 01:27:35.320
Three times in your heart.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:41.700
Mother, am I my own master?

01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:56.040
I have already told you that I respect your freedom

01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:01.040
and I cannot force divine pure knowledge on you.

01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:04.300
You have to ask for it.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:14.040
So now please take your right hand

01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.300
in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:19.400
and press it hard.

01:28:26.060 --> 01:28:30.600
You have to ask 6 times, because this center has got 6 petals.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:43.500
You should say,  "Mother please, give me pure divine knowledge."

01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:52.200
This divine knowledge works through your nerves,

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:55.400
through your nervous system.

01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:05.140
Now,

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.020
as soon as you ask for divine knowledge,

01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:12.800
the Kundalini starts rising.

01:29:19.460 --> 01:29:23.800
Now raise your right hand

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:26.180
in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:29:26.380 --> 01:29:29.300
and press it hard.

01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:40.940
Here you have to say with full confidence,

01:29:41.160 --> 01:29:46.460
to open this center, you have to say with full confidence 10 times,

01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:52.300
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:14.820
I have to tell you that actually you are not this body,

01:30:15.320 --> 01:30:19.780
this mind, these conditionings, this ego,

01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:24.400
but you are the pure spirit.

01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:38.380
So now raise your right hand on your heart

01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:45.220
and say with full self-confidence, "Mother I am the pure spirit."

01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:51.600
Please say this 12 times.

01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:09.540
This all pervading divine power

01:31:09.740 --> 01:31:16.200
is the ocean of knowledge compassion and bliss.

01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:28.440
But above all it is

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:32.900
the ocean of forgiveness.

01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:41.300
And whatever mistakes you might commit,

01:31:43.420 --> 01:31:50.900
this power of this ocean of forgiveness can dissolve it.

01:31:57.120 --> 01:32:00.200
So, have faith in yourself.

01:32:02.360 --> 01:32:05.560
And forgive yourself.

01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.840
Now put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

01:32:10.100 --> 01:32:14.500
and turn your head to your right.

01:32:19.380 --> 01:32:22.640
Now here without feeling guilty,

01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:28.020
without counting your mistakes.

01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:31.200
You have to say 16 times,

01:32:31.400 --> 01:32:36.900
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:33:04.460 --> 01:33:09.500
I have already told you that logically,

01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:14.600
if you forgive or don´t forgive, you don´t do anything.

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:24.800
But if you don´t forgive then you play into wrong hands.

01:33:28.300 --> 01:33:34.200
Moreover this center is Agya center, is very constricted

01:33:34.400 --> 01:33:37.020
and if you don´t forgive Kundalini will never rise

01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:40.800
and you will miss your self realization.

01:33:48.640 --> 01:33:52.140
So forgive everyone in general.

01:33:52.340 --> 01:33:55.500
Don´t think about them.

01:34:01.480 --> 01:34:04.980
Please put your right hand on your forehead across

01:34:05.160 --> 01:34:08.400
and put down your head.

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:17.380
Here you have to say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:22.100
Say it from your heart. Not how many times.

01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:51.560
Now take back your hand on the back side

01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:54.700
of your head.

01:34:58.240 --> 01:35:03.400
Here you have to say without counting your mistakes,

01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:07.240
without feeling guilty, for your own satisfaction,

01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:12.260
"Oh Divine power, if I have done any mistake please forgive me."

01:35:12.440 --> 01:35:16.400
Please say it from your heart, not how many times.

01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:25.000
Please push back your head little bit.

01:35:27.940 --> 01:35:31.100
Push back towards the sky.

01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:39.800
Push back.

01:35:40.700 --> 01:35:44.100
Now the last center.

01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:49.740
You have to stretch your palm fully,

01:35:49.940 --> 01:35:53.520
stretch the palm fully and

01:35:53.700 --> 01:35:58.580
put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area.

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:04.300
Stretch back your fingers and put down your head.

01:36:18.360 --> 01:36:21.980
Here again I can not force self-realization on you.

01:36:22.180 --> 01:36:25.800
You have to humbly ask for it.

01:36:32.040 --> 01:36:35.940
Please put down your head and ask 7 times,

01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:39.320
"Mother, please give me self-realization."

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:45.400
and move your scalp seven times clockwise slowly.

01:37:38.620 --> 01:37:42.100
Now please take down your hands.

01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:47.800
Put both hands towards me, like this.

01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:54.400
And watch me without thinking.

01:37:57.420 --> 01:38:02.400
You achieve a state called as thoughtless awareness.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:10.280
Where you can stop your thinking and if you want to think,

01:38:10.480 --> 01:38:13.400
you can think.

01:38:17.100 --> 01:38:21.200
Now watch me without thinking.

01:38:26.300 --> 01:38:29.820
Please put your right hand towards me

01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:34.220
and put down your head. And see with the left hand,

01:38:34.400 --> 01:38:37.980
if there is a cool or a hot breeze like waves

01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:42.300
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:38:53.180 --> 01:38:56.860
You should not  put your hand on top, but

01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:00.400
it should be above your head.

01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:06.700
Some people get it faraway.

01:39:08.160 --> 01:39:12.300
If is it hot that means you have not forgiven.

01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:20.400
Now please put left hand towards me.

01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.100
Bend your head and see with your right  hand,

01:39:25.300 --> 01:39:30.220
if you can feel cool or hot breeze like  waves

01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:35.000
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:39:44.020 --> 01:39:49.400
Now take your right hand towards me, please put your right hand.

01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:54.640
Bend your head and see for yourself again with the left hand,

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:59.060
if there is cool breeze like or

01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:04.000
hot one coming out of your head for the last time.

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:17.100
Now please put both your hands

01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:20.040
towards the sky and head towards the sky

01:40:20.240 --> 01:40:25.000
and ask anyone of these three questions three times.

01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:35.560
The first question you can ask three times,

01:40:35.740 --> 01:40:41.700
"Mother, is this  the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:49.240
Or you can ask, "Mother, is this the

01:40:51.100 --> 01:40:56.400
Divine power of God´s love?"

01:41:01.220 --> 01:41:03.360
Or else you can ask three times

01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:07.100
"Mother, is this the Parama Chaitanya?"

01:41:17.720 --> 01:41:22.300
Now please bring both your hands towards me like this.

01:41:24.600 --> 01:41:27.680
You will feel very relaxed. You can put on your glasses

01:41:27.860 --> 01:41:31.000
You feel very relaxed.

01:41:33.780 --> 01:41:38.540
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze

01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:41.820
on their finger tips or on their palms

01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:48.300
or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.900
That´s really Finland. May God bless you.

01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.400
Your saintly life has started.

01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:19.900
Please care for it.

01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:23.200
Respect it.

01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:28.300
You don´t have to pay for anything whatsoever.

01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:36.200
Love yourself. Respect yourself.

01:42:38.040 --> 01:42:41.280
May God bless you.

01:42:41.460 --> 01:42:44.540
May God bless you.

01:42:44.720 --> 01:42:50.740
May God bless you. Some people have suddenly changed, you know.

01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:56.300
So be careful. It´s not mental. It is beyond mind.

01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:06.500
You don´t argue. If you start arguing, it will come down.

01:43:09.520 --> 01:43:13.400
Your attention has gone beyond mind.

01:43:16.660 --> 01:43:20.100
This is the actualization of baptism.

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:27.800
Now you can baptize many people.

01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:32.000
Only think humbly, you have to learn this.

01:43:32.180 --> 01:43:35.600
We have a very good leader in Finland.

01:43:42.740 --> 01:43:47.300
And you are welcome to know everything about it.

01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:53.100
And those who [UNCLEAR have to work] also shouldn´t worry.

01:43:53.920 --> 01:44:00.300
I don´t mind meeting them, also is time, I can meet them.

01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:12.800
Anyone who wants to meet me,

01:44:15.780 --> 01:44:20.600
come along, all of you.

01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:28.100
You are all welcome.
