00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:35.170
We have arranged this Puja specially in England
so that many more can come and work out the

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.660
awakening of Shri Krishna. 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:59.470
Gita was written long time back, and it has
been translated into so many languages, and

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:15.490
lots of commentaries and criticism has been
there.  So this bookish knowledge of Gita

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:23.860
has ruined many people, and even today you
find there are many people who are selling

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.390
the books of Gita all over and making it into
a bookish knowledge.  I don’t think Krishna

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.890
ever thought that His knowledge will be sold
out like this to every Tom, Dick and Harry. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.840
As now, as you know, the Jehovah’s Witness,
they also selling Bible.  So it has become

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:56.640
a marketing company for Shri Krishna’s Gita.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:08.350
There have been lots of horrible things against
the real religion of ascent, and Krishna has

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:16.150
said, “Whenever there is the decline of
religion,” which is true today very much,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:29.909
“and whenever there is the saints being
tortured, I come on this earth to save the

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:43.290
saints, and to destroy all the negative forces
and the devils,” as you call them, rakshasas.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:55.700
Pushtas they are called as, cruel people. 
So awakening of Krishna is very important,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:07.689
that within us He should arise and He should
manifest His qualities within us.  Then only

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:11.840
the forces will work out. 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:22.029
Krishna, as a child, killed so many rakshasas.
Then He played with gopis just to open their

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:36.799
Kundalini; He had the rasa by which to make
the energy of Shri Radha to pass through them. 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:50.980
After killing Kamsa, the main rakshasa who
was ruling, who was actually His uncle, He

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:57.569
killed him.  That means, your relations,
if they are devils and they are rakshasas,

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:06.010
they have to be killed. Because he is your
relation you should not try to save him and

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:16.690
try to bestow his evil on Sahaja Yogis or
on Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.449
So Sahaja Yoga is the only organization in
the whole world, whether you call it spiritual

00:04:22.449 --> 00:04:30.449
or whatever you may call it, is the only organization
that it is also anxious to throw away many

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.700
people from Sahaja Yoga.  There is no organization
- I mean we are not organization, also. But

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.980
there is no spiritual movement, there is no
movement in the whole world that not only

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.420
allows people to go out of Sahaja Yoga but
throws them out, because it is bound by the

00:04:51.420 --> 00:05:02.151
divine laws and it has to abide by the divine
laws.  Shri Krishna’s style was that: what

00:05:02.151 --> 00:05:11.030
is the need to throw them away? Just kill
them, finished.  So He killed His own uncle,

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:19.030
making His own aunt a widow.  His own uncle
He threw away, out of the world, sent him

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:29.020
to hell directly, finished it off. But in
Sahaja Yoga we give a chance for such people

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:39.670
also who are very devilish types, who are
very detrimental to our growth, who are against

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:47.930
spirituality, who are against God, we give
them a long rope to hang themselves. That’s

00:05:47.930 --> 00:06:00.460
the Mother side of this incarnation, but the
Krishna side is a very fast-moving one. 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:13.340
Krishna did not live for very long.  In that
short time, how many rakshasas He killed! 

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:21.460
He fought on the side of Pandavas and He killed
all the Kauravas.  He didn’t kill, He said,

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:36.000
but He did.  So the style of Krishna on one
side also is extremely sweet, extremely nice. 

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.470
He is like honey, that’s why He is called
Madhava, Madhu.  He is like honey on one

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:55.580
side, only to the bees, only to the people
who want to be blessed by Him. But to the

00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:04.900
evil people, I think He’s one of the most
dangerous personalities.  Of course Shiva

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:22.680
also does that, He has killed so many rakshasas.
And also Devi has killed many rakshasas, but

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:32.840
She went into wars, actual wars, and She went
into discussions and arguments and things

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:44.550
like that; but Shri Krishna, He never argued
and He knew how to get rid of them, one by

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:52.139
one, and He played some tricks on them. 
One of them I’ll tell you.

00:07:52.139 --> 00:08:05.520
There was a rakshasa who by pleasing Shiva
had got a blessing

00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:18.000
that he
is sleeping and in his sleep anybody wakes

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:29.050
him up, such a person should be made into
ashes, bhasmasak.  Must be a good sleeper,

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:42.039
I tell you, our neighbor, the camper, gets
some sleep like that.  And he said, “I

00:08:42.039 --> 00:08:45.490
should not be disturbed if I am sleeping.” 

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:49.390
So Shiva thought, “It’s a very simple
thing, you see. Why should anybody disturb

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:55.870
this old Johnny? And he would be sleeping
in some cave somewhere, so it’s all right.” 

00:08:55.870 --> 00:09:05.010
He didn’t think it would be quite dangerous. 

00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:18.990
And he had also blessings that nobody can
conquer him, and

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:31.610
he cannot be, he cannot be disturbed by anybody
who tries to conquer this boon on him.  So

00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:37.660
actually he was a saint, in a way, because
he was meditating and all that, but some saints

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:43.639
become ascetic and become really, like you
should say, very right-sided.  So I would

00:09:43.639 --> 00:09:49.089
call him a rakshasa only because this kind
of people are of no use.  They just go on

00:09:49.089 --> 00:09:55.220
cursing people, saying things to them and
just finishing them off.  So then you, of

00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:00.959
course in Sahaja Yoga language there are only
two things; there are Sahaja Yogis or rakshasas,

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:06.940
there’s nothing in between.  So we could
find he was a very right-sided, horrible,

00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.899
ascetic fellow who got this boon from Shiva. 

00:10:10.899 --> 00:10:17.149
There was one rakshasa, actual rakshasa, I
mean that was no saintliness in him at all. 

00:10:17.149 --> 00:10:25.149
This is a mixture, half-baked sort of thing. 
You see, if you see the canvas of Mahabharata

00:10:25.149 --> 00:10:35.119
you will be amazed that all kinds of peoples
are described in that.  So now, this second

00:10:35.119 --> 00:10:41.889
one was a real, real rakshasa, born out of
rakshasas and was of a rakshasa quality. 

00:10:41.889 --> 00:10:54.529
He, too, had another boon from Shiva that
nobody can kill him. Unless and until somebody

00:10:54.529 --> 00:11:07.089
who has got Your boon that he can kill somebody,
nobody else should kill him. 

00:11:07.089 --> 00:11:12.350
Imagine poor Shiva, you see, He thought, “It’s
a very sensible thing, after all, so that

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:19.000
he won’t cross Me.” He said, “All right.” 
He’s very easily pleased, Shiva is, the

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:23.439
problem is that. 

00:11:23.439 --> 00:11:35.759
So this second one, the real one, the real
rakshasa was torturing people, and he started

00:11:35.759 --> 00:11:43.119
a big war and Shri Krishna also went in for
that war.  He was the one, that’s the only

00:11:43.119 --> 00:11:52.189
war He fought Himself and they were all fighting
there.  So Shri Krishna knew that this Shiva

00:11:52.189 --> 00:12:00.449
is not going to let this person down at any
cost, because he knows, “I am all right,”

00:12:00.449 --> 00:12:07.129
so He would not allow him to be lost.  So
what should we do?

00:12:11.769 --> 00:12:20.269
of the battlefield.  Now is regarded as something
very cowardly to run out of a battlefield,

00:12:20.269 --> 00:12:26.620
you see.  I mean a person, if like that goes
to his house, his wife will refuse to have

00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:33.990
him.  It’s a very cowardly thing and it’s
very disgraceful, but what is for God, it

00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:41.100
has, it has - They have no sense of grace
or disgrace, you see.  So He ran out of the

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:49.379
battlefield which we call, that’s why He
is called as Ranchodas, it means “the one

00:12:49.379 --> 00:12:52.920
who runs away from the battlefield.” Ranchodas. 
It is His name. One of the names of Shri Krishna,

00:12:52.920 --> 00:13:03.759
is Ranchodas.  So He ran out, He ran out
and when this rakshasa discovered that Krishna

00:13:03.759 --> 00:13:09.100
has run away, he ran after Him. But Krishna
was running very fast, you see.  Rakshasa,

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:16.139
being so bulky, could not run that fast, but
still he was running, you see.  And Krishna

00:13:16.139 --> 00:13:23.869
was seeing that he sees Him running up to
that, was keeping it.  So He went there and

00:13:23.869 --> 00:13:29.930
He entered into the cave where this another
half-baked rakshasa and half-baked yogi was

00:13:29.930 --> 00:13:40.790
sleeping.  He took out His shawl, Shri Krishna,
and put it on that yogi and He hid Himself. 

00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:48.730
He covered his face – he was fast asleep
so very gently He did it. 

00:13:48.730 --> 00:14:00.129
Now came the number one rakshasa, he entered
into the cave, couldn’t see Krishna anywhere

00:14:00.129 --> 00:14:06.940
but he saw this man sleeping, He saw this
is Shri Krishna,  “Oh, so now You are tired

00:14:06.940 --> 00:14:12.399
and now You are sleeping, now I’ll see how
You can survive, I’ll see to it.”  And

00:14:12.399 --> 00:14:22.220
he just went onto his throat, so this half-baked
fellow who was granted this boon, got up and

00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:30.619
he looked at him and with his third eye he
burnt him and he became ….  This is the

00:14:30.619 --> 00:14:32.540
trick.

00:14:32.540 --> 00:14:47.200
So that is how He killed so many rakshasas,
and also He told tricks to others in arguments,

00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:59.379
also He killed half-baked people, quite a
lot of them.  So I must say He was so powerful

00:14:59.379 --> 00:15:11.920
that He could work out any trick on people,
sitting down in one place. And there are so

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:22.279
many stories about Him which I cannot tell
in one lecture, that His killing process was

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:28.470
so smooth that nobody objected to it.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:33.949
There was a woman who was a devil, was sent
by Kamsa to kill Him.  And she had poison,

00:15:33.949 --> 00:15:42.449
she had put poison in her breast and she came
and she started nursing Him, and when He started

00:15:42.449 --> 00:15:51.449
sucking her (when he was a little boy of three,
four years, or maybe two years) her breast,

00:15:51.449 --> 00:16:00.189
she started becoming big, big and she died. 
And then they saw that she was Putana, the

00:16:00.189 --> 00:16:01.720
one who was the devil, known.

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:13.939
And once He knew that there are two rakshasas
who are camouflaged as two big trees.  So

00:16:13.939 --> 00:16:21.929
His mother tied Him once with - she was angry
because He was stealing her butter so she

00:16:21.929 --> 00:16:32.619
didn’t know what to tie so she tied Him
with a pounding - that we have got for rice

00:16:32.619 --> 00:16:38.929
pounding, a kind of a wooden thing, big thing. 
It’s quite heavy.  So she tied Him to that. 

00:16:38.929 --> 00:16:45.570
It’s such a heavy thing, I mean, you need
at least five-six people to lift it, but when

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:51.579
she went away, Shri Krishna just walked with
it with His small, little feet, you see, and

00:16:51.579 --> 00:16:54.779
went near those trees and hit them both on
both the sides and both the trees fell down

00:16:54.779 --> 00:16:57.899
and the rakshasas died.

00:16:57.899 --> 00:17:10.679
He was so knowledgeable and so clever, because
you know that He is the brain. He is the Virata. 

00:17:10.679 --> 00:17:18.660
He did it without any compassion whatsoever. 
All His love, all His compassion, all everything,

00:17:18.660 --> 00:17:28.440
duty, was only meant for His gopis and gopes. 
And then, when He became the king, also His

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:37.210
life is very mysterious for people to understand,
but Sahaja yogis can understand it. But when

00:17:37.210 --> 00:17:44.070
He became the king, He had to have wives,
so He married five wives.  Imagine, more

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:52.440
than Mohammed Sahib.  These five, why five? 
Because they were five elements.  So they

00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:59.020
were the causal of the five elements so He
married five wives.  Now he had sixteen thousand

00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:02.090
powers. 

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:08.240
Now you see a man, he may be old, even about
ninety years of age, if he wants to keep some

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:15.310
women around him, they will say he is a bad
man.  Not with a Mother, no, Mother can have

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:19.930
as many as She likes, nobody is going to say
anything about Her character, because Mother

00:18:19.930 --> 00:18:28.210
is Mother. But a man, see, he might be absolutely
jumping into his grave, whatever it is. 

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:33.620
And there also, in India especially, if a
lady tries to help him out, to be out of the

00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:38.380
grave, they will say he had bad relations
with her.

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:44.300
So it was such a bad situation at that time
that He didn’t want to have bad name. 

00:18:44.300 --> 00:18:49.300
So He said, “What should we do about these
powers, because they’ll be women?  If they

00:18:49.300 --> 00:18:54.410
have to come on this earth, they’ll be women
and I don’t want to have bad name,” because

00:18:54.410 --> 00:19:02.610
He came for dharma.  So what He did that
these women became the princesses, and one

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:10.950
king captured all of them.  All these sixteen
thousand women were under the capture of this

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:21.650
man and this man was about to abuse them,
so Shri Krishna invaded that man and got hold

00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:27.990
of all these.

00:19:27.990 --> 00:19:45.250
So

00:19:45.250 --> 00:20:02.820
the

00:20:02.820 --> 00:20:09.320
sixteen thousand women which were captured
by this camp - imagine why should it be sixteen

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:15.240
thousand?  Imagine sixteen thousand women,
it’s no easy thing to do.  This man had

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:22.660
sixteen thousand women who succumbed to his
aggression and were there.  And then He attacked

00:20:22.660 --> 00:20:29.540
this man and captured those sixteen thousand
women and brought them and legally married

00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:34.040
them to show they were married. But what’s
the question of marriage because they were

00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:43.310
His powers?  And He used their powers, you
see. For what? For creating so many things,

00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:51.730
like if Shri Krishna had not come we would
not have known really the significance of

00:20:51.730 --> 00:20:54.750
spiritual life. 

00:20:54.750 --> 00:21:01.981
He was the first who talked of spiritual life. 
Rama did not talk of spiritual life, though

00:21:01.981 --> 00:21:06.470
there was an undercurrent in India.  People
knew there is spiritual life because there

00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:16.320
were saints, there were lots of what you call
the seers.  All of them were talking about

00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:24.850
it. But no incarnation talked about spiritual
life.    We had Rama Avatara, then we had

00:21:24.850 --> 00:21:29.710
Parashurama.  We had so many of these people.
Never, never they talked of spiritual life,

00:21:29.710 --> 00:21:37.830
never.  It was Shri Krishna only who first
started talking about spiritual life, and

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:43.080
only to Arjuna He talked, because you see
what was the condition.  People were not

00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.400
prepared.  So those people, Sahaja Yogis,
who feel frustrated today because there are

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:53.270
not many Sahaja Yogis or there is an obstruction,
there are certain problems, must know that

00:21:53.270 --> 00:22:00.240
at the time of Shri Krishna He could dare
speak about spirituality only to one person

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:09.970
and that one was Arjuna.  So, I mean, we
are much better off, you see, aren’t we? 

00:22:09.970 --> 00:22:18.060
Then, of course, of course after Shri Krishna,
who took the lead was Christ and He started

00:22:18.060 --> 00:22:26.540
talking about spirituality.  Even you’ll
be surprised that Abraham or Moses did not

00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:36.830
talk of spirituality.  They talked of God,
but not of spirituality. Till Christ came,

00:22:36.830 --> 00:22:42.270
nobody said that you are to be born again,
even on the other side of the world, only

00:22:42.270 --> 00:22:51.980
Shri Krishna said this thing.  Shri Rama
was taught by His guru that He should be born

00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:58.130
again, in the sense that what is the Kundalini
and all that, not that He should be born again.

00:22:58.130 --> 00:23:04.541
But He had become a human being, as I told
you. So he taught Him about Kundalini, he

00:23:04.541 --> 00:23:10.990
told Him about Kundalini but it was a very
secret science followed by only very nath

00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:18.250
pundits as we call them, as the Adi Nath and
all that.  Very few people were given Realization.

00:23:18.250 --> 00:23:25.040
In Rama’s time as we know of one, Nachiketa,
and His father-in-law was a realized soul,

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:31.010
so compared to that, imagine how many of
us are today here who know about spirituality. 

00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:37.940
Not only we feel our spirituality, we are
spiritual.  If you apply law of chance, I

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:47.140
don’t think there could have been after
Christ even thirty people available, because

00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:54.330
if you see Christ died only two thousand years
back.  From Krishna’s time to Christ’s

00:23:54.330 --> 00:24:04.450
time it was six thousand years, and in six
thousand years Krishna had none and Christ

00:24:04.450 --> 00:24:15.350
had twelve, so now calculate only two thousand
years after that, how many could be?

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:25.030
So we must know that it’s now in a new explosion,
that’s why I call it as “blossom time,”

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:31.590
that we are definitely spiritual people, we
have got spirituality and that the Divine

00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:37.410
is working. So the Kali Yuga is finishing,
now it is Krita Yuga and the Krita Yuga is

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:46.420
acting and this acting of Krita Yuga is responsible
for giving us so many Sahaja Yogis.  Krita

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:54.490
Yuga means in the time when this all-pervading
Power has started acting.  Nobody before

00:24:54.490 --> 00:25:06.010
felt the cool vibrations, can you believe
that?  They felt the cool but not the vibrations. 

00:25:06.010 --> 00:25:15.660
It was never related to any science; it was
never related to physical science specially. 

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:26.040
So I must say the achievement of Sahaja Yoga
is tremendous.   Also, thanks to this evolution

00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:41.990
in the acting of Yugas, also, that the all-pervading
Power has started acting as I am on this earth.

00:25:41.990 --> 00:25:45.340
But you could say that “Mother, why didn’t
You come earlier?”   That was not the

00:25:45.340 --> 00:25:52.190
time.  Even today you find stupid people
all around us.  I mean the percentage of

00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:59.890
sensible people seems to be quite low in the
western countries, though high up in others,

00:25:59.890 --> 00:26:04.720
but in the western countries very low, as
far as the wisdom is concerned.

00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:08.110
So we have these obstructions, these small
things going on, doesn’t matter.  Sahaja

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:17.010
Yoga will now prosper.  It will flower and
whatever people may say, you shouldn’t worry,

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:25.550
because once they start finding joy and happiness,
once they start finding the truth, and if

00:26:25.550 --> 00:26:30.160
they are honest, they will not leave Sahaja
Yoga. And many people know that they just

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:34.430
don’t want to leave Sahaja Yoga.  I mean,
say there is a husband and wife, and the wife

00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:38.770
is a horrible woman, supposing, or the husband
is a horrible person and he obstructs the

00:26:38.770 --> 00:26:44.520
wife from coming to Sahaja Yoga, the husband
will say, “All right, you go ahead, I will

00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:50.460
be with Sahaja Yoga because I have now felt
the ambrosia, I have felt the beauty, the

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.410
joy.”

00:26:53.410 --> 00:27:00.950
Now imagine at the time of Shri Krishna, He
talked to one person about the spirituality,

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:10.480
only one person, Arjuna, which was heard by
Sanjaya and which he related.  It is so written

00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:19.850
by Vyasa, but He didn’t tell to everyone,
didn’t show to anyone.  He appeared in

00:27:19.850 --> 00:27:29.350
His Virata form on the battlefield but He
never showed, but now you have got photographs

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:35.340
to see, even if you can’t see with your
eyes.  Some can see some things also, I’ve

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:40.680
seen that some are feeling it. So you are
developing, you are growing into it.   So

00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:47.370
this is into a new realm.  It was Shri Krishna
Who started talking about it.  Of course

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:52.110
these nath pundits did believe in all that
spirituality, but they did not talk about

00:27:52.110 --> 00:28:00.660
it, till the time, I think, of Gyaneshwara,
perhaps would be.  It was first the Gyaneshwara

00:28:00.660 --> 00:28:06.500
only who started talking about it.  Before
that it was a secret kept.  Of course after

00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:15.010
Gyaneshwara we had other people talking about
it, like we had Mohammed Sahib, we had Nanaka,

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:22.960
we had so many other people like Shirdi Sai
Nath and some Sufi people and they started

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:28.110
talking on spirituality.

00:28:28.110 --> 00:28:37.930
So we have to be historically very much thankful
to Krishna because He is the One who has broken

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:42.730
the first knot and that’s why it’s called
as Vishnu Granthi and the Vishnu Granthi to

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:53.620
knowledge has been first opened by Shri Krishna
and He wanted that gradually it should work,

00:28:53.620 --> 00:29:05.680
gradually.  So His Gita is not so clear cut,
but is diplomatically written.  So now we

00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:13.150
can find that the only person who first tried
his hand on Gita was Gyanadeva and Gyanadeva,

00:29:13.150 --> 00:29:18.550
when he wrote on the sixth chapter, everything
about Kundalini, they just said, “This is

00:29:18.550 --> 00:29:27.511
banned, you are not to read this one,” because
they could not deliver the goods.  People

00:29:27.511 --> 00:29:33.530
knew about Kundalini, but they didn’t want
to read because they were told, “No, No,

00:29:33.530 --> 00:29:38.970
don’t read, this is very wrong,” and all
that.

00:29:38.970 --> 00:29:47.940
So spirituality is a subject absolutely unknown
to the western people, though Christ was there

00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:56.540
but they have been only crucifying Him. 
If I see the Christianity, if I see Christ,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:30:03.490
it’s so organized.  From Christianity nobody
can get out.  Whatever sin you may commit,

00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:11.460
you are still a Christian.  I know there
was a fellow who murdered someone and he was

00:30:11.460 --> 00:30:12.460
taken to the courts. 

00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:14.130
They said, “What are you?”

00:30:14.130 --> 00:30:17.200
And he said, “I am a Christian,” though
he had murdered. 

00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:20.961
Then they gave him the Bible, “All right,
put your hand on the Bible and say you are

00:30:20.961 --> 00:30:24.480
a Christian.” 

00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:29.690
He said, “I am a Christian, I believe in
Bible.” But why didn’t they ask, “Why

00:30:29.690 --> 00:30:35.060
did you kill then?”  Thou shalt not kill.

00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:41.680
So even these religions which were formed
did not have any rules or regulations that

00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:48.130
“All right, if somebody does like that we’ll
throw him out of our congregation or he is

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:54.550
no more a Christian.”  On the contrary,
you’ll be surprised that when My father

00:30:54.550 --> 00:31:05.630
joined Congress in India to fight against
the British, they threw him out of the congregation

00:31:05.630 --> 00:31:11.330
because according to the missionaries there,
Christ was born in England.  He must be

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:19.530
an Englishman, so how dare My father join
the Congress?  Such an absurd idea!

00:31:19.530 --> 00:31:27.060
So all these ideas which are so absurd, against
God - against religion, against spirituality

00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:35.760
- became very prevalent and useful and convenient
for these organized religions.  That’s

00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:42.210
one thing good about Hindu religion is there
is nothing like a organization.  So they

00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:48.470
can be agnostic, atheist, they can be anything. 
They could be Buddhist, they could be Jains. 

00:31:48.470 --> 00:31:54.830
They could be anything and they could be Christians,
but they could be Hindus also because it’s

00:31:54.830 --> 00:32:00.571
not organized and because they are not organized,
there is no restriction on them that “Don’t

00:32:00.571 --> 00:32:05.720
do like this; don’t do like that.”  But
despite that I have seen, I’m surprised

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.921
that Hindus are very meek people because the
responsibility is left to themselves, not

00:32:10.921 --> 00:32:16.230
on an organization.   If you have murdered
somebody you are not to confess to the priest

00:32:16.230 --> 00:32:23.030
but confess to yourself and face yourself
all the time. But so many filthy things crawled

00:32:23.030 --> 00:32:33.050
into this religion, also, of caste system
which is just against Shri Krishna.  They

00:32:33.050 --> 00:32:38.430
have no business to take Shri Krishna’s
name and do all these nonsensical things because

00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:46.470
Shri Krishna Himself has said that, “In
everybody it resides.” But they changed

00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:50.960
it a little, saying that, “Your caste is
according to your birth.”  How can it be? 

00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.760
 As I told you the other day.

00:32:52.760 --> 00:33:07.520
Now this is another story I would say that
they have tried to, Christ look like something

00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:12.590
very ordinary or even Shri Krishna look like
something ordinary.  These are the intellectuals. 

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:18.540
So on one side we have the stupid followers
and the another side we have those stupid

00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:30.470
intellectuals.  So the message of Krishna
never reached Hindus because He said, “In

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:36.150
everybody resides the Spirit and you are part
and parcel of the whole.”   Now a cell

00:33:36.150 --> 00:33:47.580
in the hand, is it an outcast because it is
not in the brain?  So what a wrong thing

00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:56.600
they have done to Shri Krishna and that’s
why when they suffer from racialism, I say,

00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:03.750
“You did the same to the caste, through
your caste system you tortured the Harigans,

00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:14.210
you tortured the lower caste of people. 
So now you have them.”  It boomerangs,

00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:16.159
whole thing.

00:34:16.159 --> 00:34:24.399
So Shri Krishna’s life, if you see, is the
beauty of it is that He said that “Life

00:34:24.399 --> 00:34:35.740
is a leela” - for Him, not for everyone,
because He is so powerful. And this leela

00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:42.629
part was taken over by Americans very nicely
because they were born in the land of Shri

00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:47.520
Krishna, that it’s all leela. “What’s
wrong? Do what you like, what’s wrong?” 

00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:53.080
Whatever you are doing is just a leela, is
just a play. So what?   Marry as many as

00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:58.570
you like, leave your children to dogs, do
all kinds of things with your morality, destroy

00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:05.530
yourself morning till evening, behave in the
same manner as if they are animals. So what? 

00:35:05.530 --> 00:35:09.261
Study the animal behavior because it’s as
if we have no sense of behavior, so we study

00:35:09.261 --> 00:35:13.369
the animal behavior and behave like the animals.

00:35:13.369 --> 00:35:20.220
So are we going to become now snakes or some
sort of worms or I don’t know what they

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:33.010
are up to, and whole system is just the opposite
of Shri Krishna.  So this stupid movement

00:35:33.010 --> 00:35:39.790
of Shri Krishna’s consciousness reached
there.  I don’t know how they understood

00:35:39.790 --> 00:35:45.640
that Shri Krishna is the deity of America,
but somehow some bhoot must have told them

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:52.900
that “You go there.”  And they are another
stupid people who are selling Gita, selling

00:35:52.900 --> 00:36:03.540
this bookish knowledge, but now of course
it has boomeranged on him and now they are

00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:13.869
all right.  Now they are frozen. But the
way they have been talking about Shri Krishna,

00:36:13.869 --> 00:36:19.670
they do not realize they have missed the point. 
He said, “It’s a leela.” So then why

00:36:19.670 --> 00:36:24.570
are you wearing these dresses, why have you
become a sanyasi?  Why are you giving up

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:33.740
- not to eat this food, not to eat that food?  
And then they are taking drugs, they are selling

00:36:33.740 --> 00:36:34.740
drugs. 

00:36:34.740 --> 00:36:43.010
Whatever is not based on truth will go to
something that is destructive.  Truth is

00:36:43.010 --> 00:36:49.850
the only thing that is constructive.  All
these ideas sometimes confuse us, what is

00:36:49.850 --> 00:36:54.760
this, in the name of God, in the name of Shri
Krishna, in the name of Christ, in the name

00:36:54.760 --> 00:37:03.650
of Mohammed Sahib all these things are done
and also some people do it even in My name,

00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:10.600
“Mother said; Mother said so.”  It is
prohibited for Sahaja yogi to say that because

00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:18.180
I’ve had enough of it in last lives.  
So this life nobody is going to say, “Mother

00:37:18.180 --> 00:37:21.080
said it.” 

00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:30.430
“I say.” Have that much confidence and
responsibility to say, “I say.”   I

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:36.270
am a Sahaja Yogi, you are a Sahaja Yogi, why
can’t you say?

00:37:36.270 --> 00:37:45.800
So now from today’s Puja onward we have
awakened the Shri Krishna within us, so His

00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:53.211
powers of sweetness as well of destruction
will act and you don’t have to worry, you

00:37:53.211 --> 00:37:56.900
are completely protected.  He has already
said that “Yoga dakshemo myam.”  “I

00:37:56.900 --> 00:38:04.250
give you yoga” and the “dakshemo myam”
means your benevolence, He looks after. 

00:38:04.250 --> 00:38:15.970
So you don’t have to worry, but it will
act and it will work and nobody can harm you. 

00:38:15.970 --> 00:38:25.690
It will all boomerang on them.  There’s
like divine punishment and you don’t have

00:38:25.690 --> 00:38:32.830
to worry.  Of course, as a Mother, I never
feel of punishing anyone, as such, but they

00:38:32.830 --> 00:38:39.780
just get punished, what can I do?  And now
this awakening can be very dangerous, so I

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:47.920
think we have to accept it now within ourselves
that we have to be extremely sweet, nice,

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.920
collective. 

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:54.500
If you are not collective then Krishna will
be after your life.  If you try to destroy

00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:58.710
collectivity He will be after you, I mean
He is a tremendous person, I tell you.  He

00:38:58.710 --> 00:39:05.130
is so tricky, He is so clever, and He is a
very smooth worker, I tell you.  So be careful. 

00:39:05.130 --> 00:39:11.380
If you are collective then He’ll strengthen
you, He’ll nourish you, He’ll do everything,

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:19.160
He’ll give you butter to eat.  So you have
to be collective, that’s the main part. 

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:24.060
And those people who just come to the program
and then disappear should know that it won’t

00:39:24.060 --> 00:39:29.440
work out.  You have to be collective and
if they don’t want to be collective, we

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:34.560
don’t want to force them. But if they are
not collective they are not Sahaja Yogis and

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:40.720
nobody should recommend them to anyone and
Sahaja Yogis should have nothing to do with

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:49.930
non-collective people nor with people who
are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:39:49.930 --> 00:39:54.020
We have very beautiful children here, we have
beautiful families.   We have everything

00:39:54.020 --> 00:40:00.250
so beautiful, such beautiful people to love
each other and enjoy each other.  So we should

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:06.860
not get entangled into the mess of other people
who are blind.  It would be like we have

00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:11.730
a nice organized place where everybody is
sitting in the light, suddenly you want to

00:40:11.730 --> 00:40:19.390
go to the place where there are many snakes
inhabited who are biting everyone.  So go

00:40:19.390 --> 00:40:24.510
ahead and then you shouldn’t say that “Mother,
you punished me.”   You wanted to go into

00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:32.250
the hell of the snakes, so you go and have
it.  I never punish. But maybe Shri Krishna

00:40:32.250 --> 00:40:41.550
might lure you there, you see that’s His
style, just to have a little bite of a snake.

00:40:41.550 --> 00:40:47.660
So according to Shri Krishna, we have to be
very playful.  Now we are all realized people,

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:53.780
and you are very happy and you are all very
playful and joyous and also now you are so

00:40:53.780 --> 00:41:01.070
capable, you have spirituality, you can give
Realization to others.  Even I was told that

00:41:01.070 --> 00:41:09.260
in the streets people ask for Realization,
some people went to Eastern Blocs and they

00:41:09.260 --> 00:41:16.711
got five thousand people.  Somebody went
down to Argentina, got so many people.  So

00:41:16.711 --> 00:41:21.980
it’s very good, all these, My hands are
extending and the work is taking place. 

00:41:21.980 --> 00:41:23.530
Everybody should take it up. 

00:41:23.530 --> 00:41:27.300
Select a place and I’ll go there and work
it out.  Select one place and work it out,

00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:33.079
all of you can do it because you have now
got the powers, better work it out, use them. 

00:41:33.079 --> 00:41:37.869
If you don’t use the powers, you’ll become
blunt, so use your powers and believe that

00:41:37.869 --> 00:41:43.580
you have power and that only thing you have
to keep in the bounds, in the maryadas of

00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:53.560
Sahaja Yoga, that you have to lead a very
moral, good life and you must feel your vibrations

00:41:53.560 --> 00:42:02.290
properly and keep good health which you can
easily do.  If, as they say, I can work like

00:42:02.290 --> 00:42:06.970
this, days in, day out, you can also work. 
You are all very young, everybody seems to

00:42:06.970 --> 00:42:14.850
be younger than Me.  I am the oldest person
here.   So if I could do so much, why can’t

00:42:14.850 --> 00:42:15.850
you? 

00:42:15.850 --> 00:42:19.910
So one thing you must ask in your prayer in
the evening when you are sleeping: “What

00:42:19.910 --> 00:42:26.100
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?” One sentence,
all of you, just ask this question: “What

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:38.440
have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”   Like persons
like Me or Shri Krishna or anyone, We don’t

00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.130
even feel We are doing anything.  So what
can We ask?   If I want to ask Myself, I’ll

00:42:43.130 --> 00:42:47.890
fall into an ocean I think, I don’t know,
I’ll be lost.  If I want to analyze Myself, I

00:42:47.890 --> 00:42:52.860
get lost.  If I want to think about Myself,
I get lost.  It’s beyond Me, then let it

00:42:52.860 --> 00:43:01.980
be, doesn’t matter.  I don’t want to
know Myself. But you better know yourself. 

00:43:01.980 --> 00:43:04.130
You can’t be Me.

00:43:04.130 --> 00:43:12.900
So as far as I am concerned I only think that
as long as I live - I don’t know, I may

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:18.450
live forever, I am living forever maybe, you
might say that, but whatever it is as long

00:43:18.450 --> 00:43:39.760
as I’m on this earth I will see that Sahaja
Yoga is fully established.  This is My promise

00:43:39.760 --> 00:43:40.770
to you. 

00:43:40.770 --> 00:43:41.770
[Maharathi]

00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:48.130
He comes on this earth again to establish
the religion, but not only religion but Vishwa

00:43:48.130 --> 00:43:54.400
Nirmala Dharma, which is a much higher religion
than the ordinary religion of human beings.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.400
within themselves, is the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma
we’ll establish in a very short time, I’m

00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400
sure, on this earth.

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.400
So may God bless you!

00:43:57.400 --> 00:43:58.400
So today the children are sleeping now – if
they can get up for a while they can come

00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.400
and wash My feet.  How many are awake? 
Some are awake.  You can sing some Ganesha

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:00.400
song instead of Atharva Sheersha.
(break in recording)

00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:01.400
…. no provision for this kind of acceptance
of these ornaments, but when he came he just

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.400
tried to take everything that was in that
temple.  At that time the story was created,

00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.400
I don’t know how far it is true, but a story
of Indians, you see, Indian style.  The story

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.400
was like this: that when Mahadeva was attacked
by him, He started running away from the temple. 

00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:05.400
He was running, running, running, running
fast and then He found Bhairava sitting there. 

00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:06.400
So Bhairava and Hanumana both were sitting
and They said, “You are the Devas of Devas,

00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:07.400
You are the Mahadeva of Devas and why are
You running?  After all, what is he, this

00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:08.400
Tamolang?  Why running? He was lame with
one foot and why are you running away from

00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400
him? You can just finish him off; what is
the need to run away?”

00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:10.400
No, he was Mohammed Gazni. Sorry, he was Mohammed
Gazni who did it, but  Tamolanga also attacked

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.400
but then Mohammed Gazni. So this Mohammed
Gazni was running after Mahadeva, and first Tamolanga

00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.400
has looted but he couldn’t go to that far,
so this Mohammed Gazni came in and he started

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:13.400
looting that temple.  So then when he started
running after Mahadeva, Mahadeva told him,

00:44:13.400 --> 00:44:14.400
“You don’t know, you don’t know this
Mohammed Gazni, who is. His name is Mohammed

00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:15.400
Gazni but he is somebody else.” 

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:16.400
Said, “Who is he?” 

00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:17.400
“All right, come, you hide here, I’ll
show you.”

00:44:17.400 --> 00:44:18.400
So behind Mahadeva was running Mohammed Gazni,
so they hid themselves on one side and they

00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:19.400
saw this Mohammed Gazni came and he was very
tired.  He sat down near one tree and he

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.400
started just relaxing, and suddenly they found
it was Shri Krishna.  He said, “This valundar,”

00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:21.400
means this, this cunning fellow, “is running
after me, now do you think I may escape him? 

00:44:21.400 --> 00:44:22.400
Of course I should have punished these Brahmins
who were misbehaving.  I did not so, he has

00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:23.400
come, but now I cannot help so I am away out
of it, you see, because this one has come

00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:24.400
after My life and now you cannot save yourself.” 

00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:25.400
So this is the story the people, the general
public, created there.  So it has happened

00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:26.400
many a times because He was the brother of
the Shakti of Shiva and because He’s so

00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:27.400
clever, he’s so intelligent that Shiva was
quite afraid of Him, and overactive.   So

00:44:27.400 --> 00:44:28.400
you see Americans are extremely active people
and now, of course, England, we need not say. 

00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.400
It’s a little lethargic, little bit, not
much.  So now the awakening of Shri Krishna

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.400
is going to work everywhere, and you are all
going to be extremely active about Sahaja

00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:31.400
Yoga, I think so.  This is a new thing that
has happened, and I’m very happy it has

00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.400
happened and that the Americans also agreed
to come here.  By this we take a little bit

00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:33.400
of the qualities of Shiva to America, that
is of magnanimity and also of laziness a little

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:34.400
bit, and give some qualities of Shri Krishna
to this country.  This exchanges it.

00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:35.400
Shri Krishna Puja 1990: Shri Mataji speaks
about the music to be played by the musicians.

00:44:35.400 --> 00:44:36.400
Below is a transcription of the relevant details.

00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.400
Now the last raga is Bhairavi has to be played
under all traditional ways and is a raga that

00:44:37.400 --> 00:44:38.400
is in praise of the power of the Spirit, because
it has such beautiful notes and notes which

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:39.400
are … it’s a complete sampurna, is a complete
raga. All the twelve notes are in it. So you

00:44:39.400 --> 00:44:40.400
see it is such a complete raga and it has
to be played in all due respect to it. It’s

00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:41.400
a ragini, regarded as.

00:44:41.400 --> 00:44:42.400
Now as you know that the Heart Chakra has
got twelve petals, and the Durga resides on

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.400
the Heart Chakra. Now the Durga’s qualities
are that She is protective of Her children,

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:44.400
She’s very gentle, very soft with Her children,
and She’s extremely horrifying to the satanic

00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:45.400
people, to the negative people. So in this
raga I think because there are, the notes

00:44:45.400 --> 00:44:46.400
are spaced out. So either you could play it
slow or you could play it fast. Nothing in

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.400
between. That’s why it is on a Durga’s
style. You see, either She is extremely gentle

00:44:47.400 --> 00:44:48.400
or She is extremely horrifying. So because
She has a double function: is one to look

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.400
after Her children, and another is protect
Her children from the devils. So She has to

00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:50.400
be very quick about it, to fight them, and
to, in every way to frighten them and to be

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.400
alert about it.

00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:52.400
So in the second part you all became very
alerted I saw. In the first part you were

00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:53.400
having a lullaby because it was the Mother’s
love that was playing. The second part you

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:54.400
became alert, because She has to fight. Now,
this is such a nice raga because it gives

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.400
you a better sense of security within yourself,
builds up sense of security, and also as you

00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.400
know medically that it’s important to build
up this chakra because that gives you antibodies

00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.400
created. So to fight all the diseases, to
fight all the foreign things which try to

00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.400
attack us.

00:44:58.400 --> 00:44:59.400
So this raga is so apt, absolutely apt for
today’s atmosphere and for today’s need.

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400
That we have to have the security of the Mother
and the protection of the Mother and that

00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:01.400
all the evil forces must be finished from
this world, and that’s how this raga has

00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:02.400
a very great significance and I thank him
very much for playing this raga.

00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:03.400
This is, now the last five minutes he would
like to play is the Bhairavi which is a complete

00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:04.400
raga as you can call it, is the complete purnima.
All the notes are there. And it is played

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:05.400
in various ways and various styles and is
used for so many expressions of your feelings

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:06.400
and thing. But in this also there’s a beautiful
song as you know, the Anhi Bhavani, is the

00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.400
one which is a song about the Mother Goddess.
And in this Anhi Bhavani, I think there is

00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:08.400
a little mixture in the … I don’t know
if it is absolutely pure Bhairavi or not.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.400
Shri Mataji asks musicians: It is to be played
absolutely in Shuddha Bhairavi?

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.400
(Shri Mataji and musicians discuss together
a little then She asserts ... )

00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:11.400
It should be played in pure Bhairavi – this
is the best way. Because Bhairavi is the name

00:45:11.400 --> 00:45:12.400
of the Goddess.

00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:13.400
You see the purity of it creates that feeling
and that, I mean, it awakens that deity so

00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:14.400
that you get that effect with the Bhairavi.

00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:15.400
(Shri Mataji and musicians talk together then
She continues ... )

00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:16.400
Indian music has such a lot of freedom, such
a lot of freedom. You can do what you like

00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:17.400
with it. But only thing is you have to keep
to the ragas and you have to keep to the Swaras

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:18.400
and everything. You cannot just go crazy from
one to another like that. So it is like a

00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:19.400
big aeroplane which is going in the air with
everything completely fixed properly. You

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.400
see, so it can go anywhere. Unless and until
it’s fixed, has it’s own maryadas it cannot

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.400
go. So that has to be there. So first the
ragas are built, and built in such a way they

00:45:21.400 --> 00:45:22.400
are absolutely perfect and then you can go
wherever you feel like. Nothing will happen.

00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:23.400
(More discussion with musicians.)

00:45:23.400 --> 00:45:24.400
(Raga begins. Shri Mataji continues ...)

00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:25.400
First, he will play all the twelve notes which
are built in Bhairavi and then you will see

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.400
how he keeps to that. He keeps to that

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.400
Wow, wow! It’s the Heart Chakra. It’s
the Heart Chakra of Shiva.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:28.400
(Musicians continue to play.)

00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.400
The surrendering, you see. Islam is surrender.
Islam is the surrender.

00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:30.400
(Musicians continue to play.)

00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.400
Musician: In India it used to be different
about thirty or forty years ago, this is the

00:45:31.400 --> 00:45:32.400
kind of music we used to have, when people
would sit like you are, here, so nice, so

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.400
beautiful, a family.

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:34.400
Shri Mataji: Absolutely a family rapport.

00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.400
Musician: Absolutely

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:36.400
Musician: You bring out that from us.

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.400
Shri Mataji: You see what he’s saying is
this. You know I am such an old woman of sixty-seven

00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:38.400
years and I think of My childhood and also
of My family. My father was a great, great

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:39.400
connoisseur of music and he supported music,
and musicians left and right, and we heard

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.400
all the musicians because they would come
to our house, stay with us and he would go

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:41.400
all out to spend for them, pay for them; I
mean, do all kinds of things. So in the family

00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:42.400
the music came in and then My sister took
to music and everybody in family took to music

00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:43.400
quite a lot because of My father because he
was fond of cricket and also of music very

00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.400
much. But the best part of it, what I am feeling,
all the family would sit down and then My

00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:45.400
sister would sing or anybody, you see the
rapport. Then he would give the, what you

00:45:45.400 --> 00:45:46.400
call, the impetus, he would give us the feelings
of: “Now, this is it now coming up.”

00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:47.400
There’s such a rapport in the whole thing
between the musician and all, and with such

00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:48.400
relaxation everybody appreciating it and just
like waves after waves of a big ocean coming

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:49.400
over and that sort of a thing it was. And
then only you can enjoy music. But if you

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:50.400
are worried about time, this, that… we give
up all that to listen to music. And even if

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:51.400
you carry all that load with you, what’s
the use of listening to music? You have to

00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.400
come to music with all these things left out
and then you really enjoy the whole thing.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.400
And that is what today I feel that our whole
family of Sahaja Yogis are enjoying this rapport

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:54.400
with him and enjoying the whole beauty of
the whole music, it’s something so great.

00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:55.400
But see the surrendering, you just develop
the feeling what you get out of it, you see

00:45:55.400 --> 00:45:56.400
like….

00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:56.402
(Music continues.)
