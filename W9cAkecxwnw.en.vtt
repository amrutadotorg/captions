Her Holiness SHRI MATAJI NIRMALA DEVI
Public Program, Toronto

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:29.630
June 15, 1989

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.020
YOGI: Shri Mataji has arrived and I would
like to tell you that I have been with Her

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:45.710
for about thirteen years and I have seen the
miracles that She has performed in giving

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.280
people the experience that they have sought
for lifetimes. She is renowned in India as

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.510
the greatest living saint, She is known throughout
Europe. In Italy they have recognized Her

00:00:51.510 --> 00:01:02.040
as the Mother and I hope in North America
you recognize who She truly is. And She has

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.710
come here to give you all what you have been
seeking for lifetimes and the only need to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:18.340
do tonight is to have an open mind, the mind
of a scientist – not deny it, but just listen

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:29.110
to what Mother has to say and have the experience
and when you have the experience you cannot

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.691
deny it, because no scientist denies the results
of his experiments. So I hope you will all

00:01:32.691 --> 00:02:22.900
have this experience of self Realization and
I now present Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:52.460
Shri Mataji: I bow to all seekers of truth.
At the very outset it should be understood

00:02:52.460 --> 00:03:04.840
that truth is what it is. We cannot organize
it, we cannot change it, we cannot conceptualize

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:20.610
it. So if we have some ideas about truth we
have to know that it is to be known to us.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:32.880
This is what is called as the self knowledge.
Through self knowledge only you can know the

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:43.490
truth. Before self knowledge is not possible
because whatever we know through our mental

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:58.290
efforts, through our emotional feelings is
relative. We find a person falls in love with

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.200
someone – and after ten days you find him
walking to a divorce-case. We find a person

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:21.690
who says, “This is the best way for us”
– and after some time we find he is in great

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:33.210
trouble. In every way we find that whatever
we say is true before Self Realization, is

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:43.249
very relative. It may be all right, it may
not be all right, it may work out, it may

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:51.699
not work out – there is no definiteness
about it. Especially the mental projection,

00:04:51.699 --> 00:05:02.189
as it is, always moves in a linear direction
and then it recoils back upon you. But self

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:13.460
knowledge is a thing where your self is the
one which gives you wisdom of the Divine.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:24.610
But the light of the self comes in your attention,
then in that light you know what is the truth.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:30.349
For example somebody is standing with a snake
in his hand and it is all darkness – you

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:36.849
tell that person, “This is a snake”, he
is not going to believe you. He’ll say,

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:44.029
“All right, I don’t think so, I believe
it is a rope.” So no use arguing with such

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:53.039
a person. Best is to put the light on – so
let him have a look at it and then he just

00:05:53.039 --> 00:06:07.039
drops out the snake. In the same manner, when
the self knowledge comes into our awareness

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:17.550
we start feeling the All-pervading power which
is described as Ruah, described as the All-pervading

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:30.039
power of God’s love, described as Brahmachaitanya
- call it by any name – for the first time

00:06:30.039 --> 00:06:38.559
you start feeling on your fingertips. You
have never felt it before. Now when you start

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:46.400
feeling it on your fingertips, these centers
that are there are the sympathetic centers

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.419
five, six and seven on the left-hand side,
same sympathetic, on the right-hand side we

00:06:53.419 --> 00:07:02.909
have seven centers. So you start feeling them.
Feeling your own centers and feeling the centers

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:14.219
of others when this enlightenment comes on
your central nervous system.

00:07:14.219 --> 00:07:23.159
We have become human beings through our evolutionary
process. We don’t realize how much better

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:31.960
evolved we are than the animals. For example
if you want a dog or a horse to pass through

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:38.069
a very dirty lane he’ll just walk through,
it’s not bothered, but for a human being

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:45.090
it’s an impossible situation. In so many
ways we are evolved, but there is a little

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:51.499
bit left – this last breakthrough has to
work out about which all the saints have written

00:07:51.499 --> 00:07:59.469
that, ‘you should know thyself’. If you
do not know yourself, then you cannot know

00:07:59.469 --> 00:08:06.619
anything about God. No use talking about God,
about religion. Now you find that people who

00:08:06.619 --> 00:08:16.520
follow any religion whatsoever, any religion
– say maybe a Hindu, Christian, Muslim,

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:25.379
Sikh - any religion he may be following, he
can commit any sin. There is no restriction.

00:08:25.379 --> 00:08:32.909
Nobody says that, “I cannot commit this
sin, because I am such and such.” So there

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:45.050
is no compulsion to remain holy by following
anything. So there is something missing about

00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:51.370
it which one has to know – what is the point
we have missed. There’s nothing wrong in

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:58.840
any religion, all these great prophets were
born on the Tree of Life, like living flowers,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:06.220
and they were plucked by us and then we say,
“This is mine, this is mine”, and we are

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:13.980
fighting – but actually they all belong
to one Tree of Life. So what was the common

00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:19.750
thing that they talked and which we have missed
in practically in every religious seeking

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:32.810
was this: that we have to seek the eternal,
we have to seek the eternal and the transitory

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:40.389
is to be used in moderation, in its own limitation
and in its full understanding.

00:09:40.389 --> 00:09:49.380
Today’s problems of ecology, this, that
– all these things come from human error

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:58.550
and the human error is because they have not
found out the eternal. When you find out the

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:08.600
eternal then you become a balanced personality,
absolutely a balanced personality and the

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:19.459
balance comes from divine wisdom. All the
problems today are because human beings are

00:10:19.459 --> 00:10:32.870
not at that level of self knowledge, because
human beings are still relatively living.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:38.430
One person thinks this is good, another thinks
this is good and that’s how we exploit each

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:46.870
other, we exploit the nature, we create problems
and everything repels on us, because transitory

00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:56.709
things as you know are transitory, because
they have inbuilt quality to get destroyed.

00:10:56.709 --> 00:11:09.190
They get destroyed and gradually we learn
from them how to destroy. But human beings

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:20.610
are the epitome of evolution. God has created
human beings as the highest creation. Maybe

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:29.579
we have been given freedom, a complete freedom
to choose. If we want to go to heaven we can

00:11:29.579 --> 00:11:36.830
go, if we want to go to hell, we can go. So
this freedom we have been acting on, we can

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:47.670
say as trial and error, error and trial, and
ultimately a stage has to reach where we start

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:58.959
thinking, what mistake did we commit? Where
did we go wrong? And there we have to realize

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:05.450
that the eternal we have not sought.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:15.060
We see this miracle - say of flowers – we
see the flowers, how beautiful they are, created

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:25.449
by nature. We can’t create even one of them.
Spontaneously they appear according to the

00:12:25.449 --> 00:12:36.889
different categories they belong. The choice,
such a big choice – all this and many other

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:45.970
such living things are done by this divine
power. But we take it for granted, we just

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:53.670
take it for granted and the greatest thing
that has happened is that, that today human

00:12:53.670 --> 00:13:04.209
beings are brought to this level that now
they have become divine computers. They can

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:11.500
become divine computers. It’s a very beautiful
thing that is ahead of us – only thing we

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:21.160
should know that we have to grow into that
new awareness. This is called as the one that

00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.810
we call knowledge. Knowledge is not mental
knowledge, by reading you do not become. Kabira

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:34.880
once said that by reading too much the great
learned people have become stupid. First I

00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:39.410
used to think, how can that be? [SOUNDS LIKE:
Badi, badi pantita murrachaweiy ?]. I used

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:45.930
to think, by reading how can people become
stupid? The thing is, when you read all others

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:55.080
are in your head, but you are not there. And
this is, I find today, that we think by reading

00:13:55.080 --> 00:14:02.040
we’ll become the knowledge. Knowledge will
be, but that’s not a absolute knowledge,

00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:07.370
that’s not. That is a relative knowledge.
To get to the absolute knowledge you have

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:14.769
to become something, you have to become the
Spirit. And once you become the Spirit this

00:14:14.769 --> 00:14:22.970
knowledge is just manifested. It can be manifested
even in a little child and a child can know.

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:30.449
It’s a subjective knowledge, you can say,
but absolute. It is not arbitrary, it’s

00:14:30.449 --> 00:14:37.509
collective. You put ten children who are realized
and ask them, what’s wrong with this person?

00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:44.040
Immediately they’ll raise the same finger.
This is the thing. Now ask that person, something

00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:50.050
wrong with your throat? Are you suffering
from some trouble? He’ll say, “Yes, how

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:56.300
do you know?” These children are telling
Me. So only the decoding is needed afterwards

00:14:56.300 --> 00:15:02.259
that - what’s wrong with you, what finger
is burning? What is the problem and what does

00:15:02.259 --> 00:15:09.930
it relate to? You have to just know how to
correct it. And once you know the art of correcting

00:15:09.930 --> 00:15:16.579
it, you can correct and you can perfect it.
It’s very easy to master this art.

00:15:16.579 --> 00:15:21.910
Of course, you must know you can’t pay for
anything like this. How much did we pay to

00:15:21.910 --> 00:15:28.930
the Mother Earth when She sprouted the seeds?
If it’s a living process you don’t pay

00:15:28.930 --> 00:15:40.800
for anything. Living processes do not understand
money. How can you pay for these flowers when

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:45.240
you have to pay to the Mother Earth? Of course
you can pay to the florist – that’s a

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:50.800
different point, but to the Mother Earth you
cannot pay. She does all the job without any

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:56.180
payment. In the same way this is a living
process and you must know that you cannot

00:15:56.180 --> 00:16:01.410
pay for it. Anybody who says that, “I’m
doing God’s work, I’m doing this work

00:16:01.410 --> 00:16:07.930
for emancipation of your soul,” and all
that and takes money – tell him that he

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:17.009
should redeem his own soul first. You cannot
pay for it, you cannot put in effort also,

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:24.770
because it is a spontaneous thing. Sahaja
means: saha … with, ja …born with you

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:32.089
- is the right of this union with the Divine,
is the Yoga. For this you cannot pay, nor

00:16:32.089 --> 00:16:40.920
can you command, nor can you demand. You cannot
ask – it just works.

00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:47.371
So it’s so simple. Now some people say,
“Mother, how can it be so simple?” Anything

00:16:47.371 --> 00:16:53.560
that is vital, isn’t it simple? As soon
as we are born we know how to breathe. Who

00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:59.870
teaches us how to breathe? Automatically we
start breathing. Anything that is important

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:08.880
has to be simple, cannot be complicated. Now
about this subject I must have given thousands

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:14.589
and thousands of lectures in English language
itself, leave alone other languages. So there’s

00:17:14.589 --> 00:17:21.000
no end to it but as I always say that when
we come in this room we see so many lights

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:27.189
– only thing we have to put on one switch
and the lights are there. If I start telling

00:17:27.189 --> 00:17:32.730
you the history of light and the source of
these lights and the electricity, from where

00:17:32.730 --> 00:17:40.000
it has come, you’ll be just fed up, but
it’s all built-in. So why bother, just have

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:47.360
the lights on. In the same way it’s all
built-in within you all these beautiful things,

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:55.320
these centers and chakras. Of course we have
to admit one thing, that in the West this

00:17:55.320 --> 00:18:03.030
civilization has grown like a tree outside,
but it has not sought its roots. This is the

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:12.110
knowledge of the roots and without the roots
the tree cannot exist and the roots have no

00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:17.860
meaning if there is no tree. So it is all
inter-dependent, so we must have the knowledge

00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:25.060
of the roots and we have to know all about
it. It is very simple and you all can become

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.570
masters.

00:18:27.570 --> 00:18:29.400
May God bless you all!

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:36.910
Shri Mataji: I want to have some questions
from you. Questions should be related to the

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:43.070
subject, because I have not come here to seek
any money, seek any power or votes or anything.

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:49.840
I’ve come here to tell you what is for the
benevolence of your being and as a result

00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:58.210
of a collective, in the sense, emancipation
of the humanity. So please ask Me positive

00:18:58.210 --> 00:18:59.251
questions which will help you.

00:18:59.251 --> 00:19:00.251
Aside: Can you get … [ Mala ?]

00:19:00.251 --> 00:19:01.251
FEMALE SEEKER: When you walked in …when
you walked in … when you walked in I have

00:19:01.251 --> 00:19:22.340
seen one big energy here, of purple - is it
my [power ?] or Your energy?

00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:31.220
YOGI: (to the seeker:) Could you repeat that,
I couldn’t follow.

00:19:31.220 --> 00:19:37.260
(to Shri Mataji:) I think, apparently she
is saying, when You walked in, she saw some

00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.260
big energy force. (to the seeker:) Is that
right?

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:39.260
FEMALE SEEKER: When Shri Mataji walked in
I could see one purple energy.

00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:40.260
YOGI: Purple?

00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:41.260
FEMALE SEEKER: Purple energy.

00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.260
YOGI: Aha!

00:19:42.260 --> 00:19:45.680
FEMALE SEEKER: And I was wondering if it’s
my energy or if it’s Her energy, means … [INDIST.]

00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:50.210
Shri Mataji: (laughing) What’s that?

00:19:50.210 --> 00:19:55.850
YOGI: She said, when You walked in, she saw
some purple energy and she is wondering whether

00:19:55.850 --> 00:19:56.940
it is her energy or Your energy.

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:08.900
Shri Mataji: You see all these seeing things
are out of question, because if you see something

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:17.760
you are not that. Supposing you see the light
– then you are not the light. So it’s

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:24.220
not important. We have to be the light, we
have to be the energy.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.870
(to the audience:) Yes please!

00:20:27.870 --> 00:20:39.680
SEEKER: Yes, You were talking about the tree,
were You talking about the Tree of Life, or

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:41.120
were you talking about the roots of the tree
…

00:20:41.120 --> 00:20:42.120
Shri Mataji: I …

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.120
YOGI: When You are talking about the tree,
are you talking about the tree of life?

00:20:43.120 --> 00:20:44.120
Shri Mataji: Of course!

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:47.160
ANOTHER SEEKER: Shri Mataji, I would like
to know who was your spiritual teacher? [INDIST.:

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:55.660
SOUNDS LIKE: As you belong to a spiritual
teacher as You are]

00:20:55.660 --> 00:21:00.710
YOGI: He is asking who was Your spiritual
teacher?

00:21:00.710 --> 00:21:08.790
Shri Mataji: (laughing) Who was the spiritual
teacher of Christ? I had no teacher.

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:11.370
SEEKER: You had no teacher?

00:21:11.370 --> 00:21:19.590
Shri Mataji: There’s no need to have a teacher.
When you become the Spirit you are your own

00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:26.440
teacher. You can be born like that. But of
course there must be something about Me which

00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.580
is better that you discover it through your
self knowledge.

00:21:30.580 --> 00:21:33.870
(to the audience:) Yes, please!

00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:44.390
ANOTHER SEEKER: The gentleman who is standing
beside you said that in Your presence we will

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:48.990
experience some sort of a spiritual power.

00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:51.620
Shri Mataji: Yes [INDIST. ]

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:57.050
SEEKER: Ah, I‘m a candidate who would like
to experience.

00:21:57.050 --> 00:22:01.310
YOGI: (to Shri Mataji:) He says that I told
them that in Your presence they would experience

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.060
–will have a spiritual experience and he
says that he is a canditate and he would like

00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:06.060
the experience.

00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:11.150
Shri Mataji: Very good! You are a real sadakar,
a real seeker. What a beautiful question,

00:22:11.150 --> 00:22:13.490
thank you very much.

00:22:13.490 --> 00:22:31.130
ANOTHER SEEKER: Yeah, what I would like to
know is that, once you reach that state of

00:22:31.130 --> 00:22:36.920
your own Kundalini, are there any possibilities
that you can lose it?

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:42.531
YOGI: (to Shri Mataji:) He says, once you
achieve that status– is it possible that

00:22:42.531 --> 00:22:43.531
you can lose it?

00:22:43.531 --> 00:22:44.531
Shri Mataji: No, you don’t lose it, but
it’s like a loose connection sometimes.

00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:45.531
(Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) You understand,
electricity it could be little loose sometime.

00:22:45.531 --> 00:22:49.980
So you have to work it out and learn how to
make it really permanent – that’s all.

00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:55.761
But you don’t lose it as such, energy is
there and your connection is there but it

00:22:55.761 --> 00:23:00.920
does happen sometimes that it’s a loose
connection. Mostly I’ve seen people get

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:07.060
their Realization – then they start thinking
about it. You can’t think about it, it’s

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:11.820
beyond thinking. Then you start thinking,
“Oh I’ve got it already, I am on top of

00:23:11.820 --> 00:23:18.090
the world, now what is it?” But it must
be established, it’s very important and

00:23:18.090 --> 00:23:22.520
you must know what it is. Of course for all
that you don’t have to pay, you don’t

00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:27.200
have to do anything, but you have to give
some time. Why do we have watches? To save

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:38.700
time. Save time for what? [audience laughs]
For fixing your connections.

00:23:38.700 --> 00:24:06.690
FEMALE SEEKER: Once you have got the energy
all over your mind have you known anybody

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:09.150
that uses that power, that energy to do evil
or maybe turns themselves into self-style

00:24:09.150 --> 00:24:10.150
or to do evil to others [INDIST. ]?

00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:11.150
Shri Mataji: Oh [INDIST.], I can’t hear
with this noise.

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:12.150
YOGI: She is saying that once you get this
power – do you know of anyone who after

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:14.050
getting this power uses it for evil.

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:21.670
Shri Mataji: No, you can’t. It’s a - you
can’t use, it’s for your benevolence,

00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:29.110
for your hita – you can’t use it. You
just can’t do it. If you even start thinking

00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:35.290
of something evil, the energy will disappear,
immediately. You can’t be evil. You become

00:24:35.290 --> 00:24:37.550
saints, you become angels.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:41.460
SEEKER: You are saying that your motives are
altruistic [commentary … ?].

00:24:41.460 --> 00:24:44.140
Shri Mataji: What does he say?.

00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:49.020
SEEKER: However we have certain expenses,
such as flowers, tickets, [preps... ?]. How

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.480
do you pay for that?

00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:55.110
Shri Mataji: What’s happening?

00:24:55.110 --> 00:25:05.910
YOGI: (to Shri Mataji:) Let me answer that
question. Those of us who invited Shri Mataji

00:25:05.910 --> 00:25:12.120
to Toronto payed for the flowers. As far as
the ticket goes, Shri Mataji usually buys

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:13.120
her own ticket.

00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.430
Shri Mataji: Are you interested in money so
much?

00:25:15.430 --> 00:25:17.220
SEEKER: No! (Laughter)

00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:22.880
Shri Mataji: Actually you see, it should not
be because I shouldn’t pay for your salvation,

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:29.800
should I? It’s not good, this doesn’t
give you self-respect, but in the beginning

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:39.910
I have to do it, I know, it’s not good.
There is no harm in paying for My ticket.

00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:47.610
By God’s grace My husband is a rich man,
I should say in a rich family and My mother’s

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:53.660
family is also rich enough by God’s grace.
And they don’t mind spending this money

00:25:53.660 --> 00:26:04.350
because they know that this is the emancipation
of human beings. Of course the hall, I think,

00:26:04.350 --> 00:26:10.880
is taken by the people who are here, who think
they have achieved something – like drunkards,

00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:18.960
you see, when they want to share their drinking
they can also arrange a hall, just to enjoy.

00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.270
In the same way these who are drunk in the
beauty of God’s Love must have arranged

00:26:24.270 --> 00:26:31.000
this hall and must have paid for it. But I
hope you don’t want Me to pay for that also.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.860
(Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:38.450
SEEKER: I just have [a simple question ?]. … [INDIST.]
… expenses, I just wanted ...

00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:43.900
Shri Mataji: Yeah! Yes, you see – what I’m
saying that of course you have to pay for

00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:49.500
the aeroplane, you have to pay for the hall,
but you don’t have to pay for Self Realization.

00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:57.310
You don’t have to pay for self knowledge,
you don’t have to pay if you get cured automatically

00:26:57.310 --> 00:27:03.241
by the Kundalini awakening. But hall you have
to pay. But there are people who also give

00:27:03.241 --> 00:27:10.230
free halls to us, there are people – but
it would be very beggarish I think to have

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.510
even the hall begged from someone free. It’s
a question of self-respect.

00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:23.031
ANOTHER SEEKER: Mataji, I have been a devotee
all my life and - to Mother, to life – and

00:27:23.031 --> 00:27:29.060
still recently I got sick with leukemia cancer,
do You think I have done something wrong?

00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:37.720
YOGI: He says he has been a devotee of the
Mother and of life for all his life, but still

00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:42.710
he has been ill with cancer and leukemia – has
he done something wrong?

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:55.340
Shri Mataji: You have done nothing wrong but
in ignorance we commit mistakes, isn’t it?

00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:02.060
Leukemia is absolutely curable through Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely! You don’t have to do anything.

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:09.850
Ignorance is such that unless and until you
are connected with the Divine whatever we

00:28:09.850 --> 00:28:18.630
do is like telephoning without our connections.
The connection has to be established. So you

00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:28.870
have done nothing wrong but as you have been
dedicated to Mother you have every right to

00:28:28.870 --> 00:28:33.990
get cured completely. Sahaja Yoga has cured.
We don’t give any medicine – it’s only

00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.990
your Kundalini, when its rises automatically
you get cured. All right?

00:28:34.990 --> 00:28:36.530
FEMALE SEEKER: Oh Mother, can You explain
the awakening of the Kundalini and the experience

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:37.530
…

00:28:37.530 --> 00:28:41.420
Shri Mataji: Will you get up who is speaking?

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:47.028
FEMALE SEEKER: Oh Mother Mataji. Can You explain
to the people here the process when your Kundalini

00:28:47.028 --> 00:29:10.602
is awakened and the experiences that one gets
like I experienced and it’s very frightening

00:29:10.602 --> 00:29:11.602
for people who [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: recently
meditated and who is around You] – and you

00:29:11.602 --> 00:29:12.602
can’t explain it properly.

00:29:12.602 --> 00:29:13.602
Shri Mataji: That I am going to do now only.

00:29:13.602 --> 00:29:23.650
FEMALE SEEKER: Like that, I had some experience,
like hissing a snake, like a little bit of

00:29:23.650 --> 00:29:26.210
[levitation ?], like I can hop like a frog,
I can do so many things, You know? It’s

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:27.210
frightening. (Laughter)

00:29:27.210 --> 00:29:28.750
Shri Mataji: All that’s all wrong, you can
see, we don’t have to become frogs or earthworms.

00:29:28.750 --> 00:29:29.750
(Laughter)

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:31.920
FEMALE SEEKER: [INDIST.]

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:39.800
Shri Mataji: My child, use your brains. (Laughter)
I mean, imagine somebody says, “You have

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:49.260
to hop like a frog”, breaking your bottoms
(Laughter) – absurd! All these absurd propositions

00:29:49.260 --> 00:30:01.410
have no meaning. Anything you talk about Divine
it has to be based on scriptures. We have

00:30:01.410 --> 00:30:04.700
scriptures and scriptures who have written,
seek yourself.

00:30:04.700 --> 00:30:09.090
FEMALE SEEKER: Oh Mother, It’s [INDIST.]
Kriya Yoga by swami Vivekananda [??].

00:30:09.090 --> 00:30:10.290
Shri Mataji: Ah, …

00:30:10.290 --> 00:30:11.490
YOGIS: (laugh) [INDIST!]

00:30:11.490 --> 00:30:17.140
Shri Mataji: …you see now I don’t want
to bring controversies but Sahaja Yoga is

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.370
A-Kriya Yoga, A-Kriya.

00:30:18.370 --> 00:30:21.240
FEMALE SEEKER: The book explains all [INDIST.].

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:28.220
Shri Mataji: All right, why I tell you, how
will I explain, why. Please be seated one

00:30:28.220 --> 00:30:36.370
minute, I’ll explain to this lady. A-Kriya-Yoga
is like this: supposing you have to start

00:30:36.370 --> 00:30:45.010
a car, if car has started and ignited then
automatically all the parts of the car starts

00:30:45.010 --> 00:30:53.300
working. In the same way when Kundalini starts
moving, all these things like Bhandas and

00:30:53.300 --> 00:30:58.740
[INDIST.]take place automatically – you
wouldn’t even know about it! But Kriya Yoga

00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:04.840
is that you take out the wheel and start moving
it from outside artificially. They cut even

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:16.120
the tongue of the people. Last time when I
came in 1973 …71, I found people had their

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:22.740
tongues wagging like dogs. They had cut it,
and what was said that you have to take it

00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:36.280
back and this is a [Kaicheri ?]. Nonsense!
Absolute nonsense! You don’t have to do

00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:45.350
anything outside, artificially. It just works,
because everything is built within. I was

00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:52.600
shocked to see such prominent doctors from
India, such prominent engineers from India

00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:04.950
had cut their tongues, finished with all their
money and were there just living like cabbages.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:16.430
You become dynamic. How can you be recluses?
If it’s that energy, which is the energy,

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:22.650
which gives you comfort, which cures you,
which nourishes you. That’s the energy which

00:32:22.650 --> 00:32:31.190
gives you all the counseling, the energy that
gives you physical vitality, that energy which

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:45.040
redeems you – do you think you’ll become
stupid people? Use your brains.

00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:48.560
Now there’s one gentleman who was standing
for quite some time, so I’ll give him some

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.560
time.

00:32:49.560 --> 00:32:53.040
SEEKER: I have two questions. Number one:
we hear so much about meditation, TM, the

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.120
power of Realization, and so on.

00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.120
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:32:55.120 --> 00:33:01.260
SEEKER: Could you please explain to us what’s
the difference between what you are teaching

00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:21.740
and what you are saying and what others have
been teaching?

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.740
Shri Mataji: Yes!

00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.740
SEEKER: The second question is the gentleman
on the left has said that when he was initiated

00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:24.740
it took him 2 months to realize …

00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:28.760
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear you.

00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.238
SEEKER: … why such a big gap and what one
has to do to achieve that state.

00:33:32.238 --> 00:33:35.070
YOGI: His first question is what is the difference
between what You are telling them about Realization

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:38.960
and what others have talked, like TM and so
on – about.

00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:47.160
Shri Mataji: TM doesn’t say about self Realization
– I am sorry, TM never talked of self Realization.

00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.420
They cannot.

00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:50.930
What’s the second question?

00:33:50.930 --> 00:33:57.300
YOGI: The second question was he was asking
why with some people it takes longer to feel

00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:03.420
the vibrations because I mentioned that it
took me two months to feel vibrations and

00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:06.120
it takes some people quickly, much quicker.

00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:12.179
Shri Mataji: Ah! So this was from him. Some
people do take more time because this gentleman

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:16.930
who is here – you see – was analyzing.
You know, he is a scientist and, I know, he

00:34:16.930 --> 00:34:26.720
is aeronautical engineer. So he had read all
the books that are possible, had been to all

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:36.300
guru-shopping that was possible. So he’s
so conditioned. So, naturally, if you are

00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:42.490
that conditioned you have to little bit work
it out. But also you don’t feel, after Realization

00:34:42.490 --> 00:34:50.260
also, if this center is not all right. This
is the center of Vishuddhi and it looks after

00:34:50.260 --> 00:34:57.720
your cervical plexus and your nerve cervical
now, if it’s been numbed by something then

00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:04.240
you don’t feel the vibrations. But others
can say if the Cool Breeze is coming out of

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:11.630
your head. But normally if you have lead a
very balanced life and have not been to all

00:35:11.630 --> 00:35:21.080
kinds of false people and that you are not
very much full of your ego then it works very

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:29.460
fast. Some people don’t feel but don’t
you worry, most of you are going to feel it.

00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:30.490
So many questions in Toronto! (Shri Mataji
laughing)

00:35:30.490 --> 00:35:37.700
FEMALE SEEKER: Mother, do you believe in reincarnation
and if so, can you please talk about it - reincarnation.

00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:46.680
YOGI: She is asking if You believe in reincarnation,
and if You can talk about it?

00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:54.680
Shri Mataji: I mean, of course I believe in
it. But what is there to talk about it? (Laughter)

00:35:54.680 --> 00:36:01.141
You will know such a lot, you have patience.
Sahaja Yoga is an ocean of knowledge. Ocean

00:36:01.141 --> 00:36:07.130
of knowledge. He is an aeronautical engineer,
went to all kinds of gurus and all that. Today

00:36:07.130 --> 00:36:13.150
he is an expert on Sahaja Yoga and there are
many you have here also who are experts. So

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:18.640
the knowledge is so much. Gradually you will
know each and every thing very easily, you

00:36:18.640 --> 00:36:23.500
don’t have to exert about everything. Even
if I say, “I believe in something”, why

00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:31.880
should you accept it? Why should you accept
whatever I say? You have to see for yourself

00:36:31.880 --> 00:36:33.540
and know for yourself.

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.930
FEMALE SEEKER: Because I do believe! Ahm …

00:36:36.930 --> 00:36:42.510
Shri Mataji: You are also believing blindly.
And if I tell you also, it will be blind.

00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:44.160
So better is to see for yourself.

00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:47.920
FEMALE SEEKER: Right, I have seen, but I would
like to know, ahm …

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:48.940
Shri Mataji: It is there.

00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:50.870
FEMALE SEEKER: Because I believe You still
know more than I do.

00:36:50.870 --> 00:36:55.830
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, you will know everything,
madam. Everything! But your attention will

00:36:55.830 --> 00:36:59.900
be now more not on these things but about
self. Attention shifts.

00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:00.930
SEEKER: Ah - You posed a question to me about,
did Jesus Christ have a teacher? And His teacher

00:37:00.930 --> 00:37:07.900
was God. So I was wondering if that God is
Your spiritual teacher. When You do meditate,

00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:24.320
do You meditate upon a light, or is it, do
You meditate upon Krishna as [it back ?] literature,

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:29.790
is it Krishna or is it…?

00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:36.010
Shri Mataji: Just now you don’t have to
meditate on anything, you just get your Realization.

00:37:36.010 --> 00:37:42.080
Then gradually you will know how to meditate.
See, they will tell you – because we’ll

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:47.730
have a course, you see, of about, I think,
four, five lessons they want to give you one

00:37:47.730 --> 00:37:55.020
by one to tell you how to meditate. Actually
you don’t meditate, you are in meditation.

00:37:55.020 --> 00:38:01.540
But how to establish that meditation will
be seen individually also. Supposing you have

00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:06.970
a certain center which is caught up, say,
then they will tell you, this is the center

00:38:06.970 --> 00:38:11.820
that is caught up and this is what is to be
cleared out, and what is the Deity on that

00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:17.060
center and that’s how you have to do. It’s
very, very simple, but very scientific and

00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:23.590
precise, so you don’t have to hear, you
yourself will know.

00:38:23.590 --> 00:38:39.454
ANOTHER SEEKER: Mother, it’s a privilege
talking to You: is it necessary for me, myself,

00:38:39.454 --> 00:38:40.454
to come back again and again and get born?

00:38:40.454 --> 00:38:41.454
Shri Mataji: What he said?

00:38:41.454 --> 00:38:45.310
SEEKER: Is it necessary to come back on this
planet, this Mother Earth, to take re-birth?

00:38:45.310 --> 00:38:51.740
To come back incarnation again and again,
is it necessary? If you have this deep self

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.210
knowledge, can you get moksha? …

00:38:54.210 --> 00:38:56.190
Shri Mataji: After Realization.

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:58.620
YOGI: You mean after getting your Realization?

00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.690
SEEKER: Yes, but can’t you get more …?

00:39:00.690 --> 00:39:04.880
Shri Mataji: No, not necessary at all – but
you do take [birth ?], because you want to

00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:05.880
help others, you see?

00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.880
SEEKER: I understand that part …

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:13.560
Shri Mataji: Ah! But you are free, you need
not, you become absolutely free, if you want,

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:22.910
you will, otherwise you will not. It depends
on your own choice, it’s your own desire,

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:25.600
but you want to do it, because you want to
help people.

00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600
SEEKER: I would love to help people…

00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:27.600
Shri Mataji: That’s good!

00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:28.600
SEEKER: … even today! But I’m not sure,
whether I want to come back? Because during

00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:29.600
that period of in-transit [transition ?] I
think I will forget what I may have achieved?

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:43.970
There may be some of us left over like from
previous lives [INDIST.]. I have been seeking

00:39:43.970 --> 00:39:46.430
for years …

00:39:46.430 --> 00:39:54.800
Shri Mataji: Now, forget the past. And forget
the future. In the present just remember,

00:39:54.800 --> 00:40:03.440
you have to receive your Realization. Just
be in the present! All right? May God bless

00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:04.440
you!

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.150
Now, so many (Shri Mataji laughing) – everybody
is asking questions? Yes!

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:13.800
FEMALE SEEKER: I have to come back. I believe
in energy, pure energy and when I love to

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:38.053
see it, but to observe her I can see energies
in different colors so it’s this what I

00:40:38.053 --> 00:40:39.053
… You said to me when I see it then I am
not there. But you know what I mean. So what

00:40:39.053 --> 00:40:40.053
– ah?

00:40:40.053 --> 00:40:41.053
Shri Mataji: She is saying she sees the energy?

00:40:41.053 --> 00:40:42.053
YOGI: Yes. She sees colors.

00:40:42.053 --> 00:40:43.100
Shri Mataji: Now, you won’t see that anymore.

00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:54.112
FEMALE SEEKER: But I won’t, I am not seeing,
I am feeling it and I may, ah, I think You

00:40:54.112 --> 00:40:55.112
know what I mean, it’s something you don’t
think that she has …

00:40:55.112 --> 00:40:57.690
Shri Mataji: No, no – that’s true, but
what I am saying, by seeing it you don’t

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:02.560
achieve anything, you don’t get any knowledge.
You see, it’s a - you will know why you

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:08.960
see. You will know why you see also and you
will be corrected, all right? Just have patience

00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:14.610
with yourself. Just have patience. Because
seeing these things do not give you joy, do

00:41:14.610 --> 00:41:19.320
not give you any power but once you are realized
you can raise the Kundalini of others. It’s

00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:24.690
like one light which is enlightened can enlighten
another. But if you are sticking on to something

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:30.380
like this, “I see the energy, I want to
see this, I want to do that”, – that’s

00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:36.860
not going to help. What am I doing about it?
Is it going to help the humanity? Is it going

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:42.040
to help me? What’s the use of seeing all
these things, doing all these things – just

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:50.090
ask this question. As simple as that. I have
to give some meaning to my life, isn’t it?

00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:55.310
What is the meaning of my life if I just see
things and I say, supposing I’ll go and

00:41:55.310 --> 00:42:03.230
tell Indians that I have seen Niagara Falls,
so what? It’s in my eyes. (Laughter)

00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:27.430
SEEKER: Shri Mataji, uhm, I have been trying
to work with You for about one year now, and

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:51.170
I have skills that are causing me like this
all the time. One is my first great experience

00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:52.170
is with Christ and I had many great moments
working with You but occasionally I take Your

00:42:52.170 --> 00:42:54.040
picture and put it in my drawer for three
months and I go back saying things to me about

00:42:54.040 --> 00:42:56.200
worshipping only Christ and I only [INDIST.],
I don’t think I have this skill - but what

00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:57.200
do You say about..?

00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.200
Shri Mataji: What’s he saying? He is a Sahaja
Yogi?

00:42:58.200 --> 00:42:59.200
YOGI: I don’t know what he is. He says he
has used Your picture and he has made great

00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:00.200
experiences but he says he also had good experiences
when he has meditated on Christ, so he sometimes

00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:01.200
puts Your picture away and feels …

00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.200
Shri Mataji: No, no, no!

00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.200
YOGI: … there’s a conflict.

00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:04.200
Shri Mataji: There is no difference between
Me and Christ. What’s the difference? Not

00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200
at all! Who told you that there is a difference?

00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:06.200
SEEKER: [INDIST… as Christ said. ?]

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:10.250
Shri Mataji: Not at all, He existed at that
time, I exist now – that’s the difference.

00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:15.460
And he has talked about Me also. So it’s
all right, makes no difference. Who told you

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.460
there is a difference?

00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.760
SEEKER: He did! (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)
That’s the problem.

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:30.220
Shri Mataji: You have to integrate, you have
to understand the integration of all the incarnations,

00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:37.560
of all the prophets, you have to understand
that. They are all in one.

00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:44.800
Once Guru Nanaka was sleeping, and they said,
“Your feet are towards the Mekka.” He

00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:51.180
said, “All right, I’ll move My feet.”
He moved his feet on the other side and they

00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:56.650
said again, “It’s towards Mekka.”

00:43:56.650 --> 00:44:10.660
Who was Guru Nanaka? And who was Mohammed
Sahib? And who is Me? That all is to be understood.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:17.240
You see, when Rama came, they said, “We
believed in Parashurama, because Parashurama

00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:22.780
was dead.” It’s nice, somebody who is
dead you put him in the pocket. Parashurama

00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:27.970
was the same as Rama. Then came Shri Krishna
– they said, “We believe in Shri Krishna

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:32.610
– ah, we don’t believe in Shri Krishna,
we believe in Rama.” Whatever is dead is

00:44:32.610 --> 00:44:40.610
better to believe in that, but today I am
before you. There’s no difference between

00:44:40.610 --> 00:44:47.890
Me and Him or Nanaka, anyone, they are all
Mine. We are all related to each other, there

00:44:47.890 --> 00:44:53.990
is no difference at all. Even this much. Only
difference could be that today the time is

00:44:53.990 --> 00:44:58.590
a blossomtime, we have so many seekers and
I can give en-masse Realization. They also

00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:06.760
said the same things, “Seek yourself!”
But Christ lived only for four years – what

00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:11.210
do you expect anybody to do in four years?
I was in London four years struggling with

00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:16.800
seven hippies. I couldn’t give them Realization,
I thought that this West is all wasted, I

00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:21.980
may not be able to work it out at all. (Laughter)
Four years - can you imagine, I was struggling

00:45:21.980 --> 00:45:30.670
with seven hippies. (Laughter) I must say,
Christ at least was better than Me, quite

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:38.520
efficient. (Laughter) I mean, nobody listened
to Him. At least you are listening to Me.

00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:44.941
(Laughter) Isn’t it a better thing? And
also your questioning is all right, but you

00:45:44.941 --> 00:45:49.450
are not angry with Me by any chance. And you
are not going to crucify Me - this is the

00:45:49.450 --> 00:46:02.090
difference. (Laughter) We are evolved! (Applause)
We are evolved now. Much more evolved, I must

00:46:02.090 --> 00:46:03.090
say.
Yes, please!

00:46:03.090 --> 00:46:04.090
SEEKER: Shri Mataji, [INDIST….chappels…]

00:46:04.090 --> 00:46:05.090
Shri Mataji: Kya…? What’s this?

00:46:05.090 --> 00:46:06.450
YOGI: He wants to know about the experience.

00:46:06.450 --> 00:46:23.530
Shri Mataji: Yes! I think you are all great
people who have come here. Nobody asked Christ,

00:46:23.530 --> 00:46:29.040
they never asked Him, “Give us the experience
of self knowledge.”

00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.980
SEEKER: … the answer?

00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:37.601
Shri Mataji: Please be seated, just now we’ll
work it out, now. Now this gentleman, now

00:46:37.601 --> 00:46:40.790
you ask some questions, again you have some
questions, Sir?

00:46:40.790 --> 00:46:44.690
ANOTHER SEEKER: Yes, [INDIST … last year.
?]

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:49.900
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear him at all.

00:46:49.900 --> 00:47:00.970
SEEKER: [INDIST.] I am sitting on the chair
and [INDIST.] there is some stop here on my

00:47:00.970 --> 00:47:06.830
back [INDIST.] I see myself [INDIST.] like
everyone [INDIST.] …

00:47:06.830 --> 00:47:10.090
Shri Mataji: What’s he saying?

00:47:10.090 --> 00:47:13.990
SEEKER: … and the bigger one, [INDIST.]
…

00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:15.950
Shri Mataji: Yeah!

00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:22.460
SEEKER: … and I am asking myself how it
happened [INDIST.] …

00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.060
YOGI: What’s your question?

00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:47.352
SEEKER: so what I want to know is that since
I have reached all that state of feeling something

00:47:47.352 --> 00:47:48.352
is coming out of my head, is that the way
what you call the stage of being conscious,

00:47:48.352 --> 00:47:50.750
we can call it as the experience of the Mother
of the universe [INDIST.] …

00:47:50.750 --> 00:47:57.560
YOGI: He has had some sort of experience of
this face expanding sideways and some ticklings

00:47:57.560 --> 00:47:58.560
on his back – he’s asking if that’s
the experience.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:03.250
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no – not that kind,
that’s absurd. The experience is that you

00:48:03.250 --> 00:48:08.680
become thoughtlessly aware first of all and
you start feeling the Cool Breeze on your

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:15.390
fingertips, you start feeling the Cool Breeze
coming out of your head, it’s the real baptism

00:48:15.390 --> 00:48:22.230
as we call it. All these experiences are not
there and they are not all right – they

00:48:22.230 --> 00:48:25.410
have to be corrected.

00:48:25.410 --> 00:48:59.120
ANOTHER SEEKER: Shri Mataji, [INDIST.] as
conscious mind and unconscious mind and we

00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:28.020
are reading from [INDIST. ?] Whereas Sahaja
Yoga as such is spreading in the whole process

00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:29.020
of conscious or subconscious mind? The first
one … the second one is that there is no

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.020
answer to my question, you are the Christ?
[??] And my third one: Why do you …

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:31.020
YOGI: Could you speak up please? Can you speak
up please?

00:49:31.020 --> 00:49:32.020
SEEKER: …[INDIST.] since You are realizing
Your soul you begin rise above the mind, on

00:49:32.020 --> 00:49:33.020
so many ways and since we have not realized,
I am not Christ myself, I am not Christ, I

00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:34.020
do not …

00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.020
Shri Mataji: Did you follow? It’s beyond
Me. What did he say?

00:49:35.020 --> 00:49:36.020
YOGI: The first question was, where does Sahaja
Yoga fit in like the conscious mind and the

00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:40.710
unconscious and Parabrahma and his second
question was that after You got your Self

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:48.260
Realization You were Christ and Guru Nanak
and so on. But he hasn’t got it - so he

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.540
isn’t. I don’t follow that man in all
specific …

00:49:51.540 --> 00:49:52.540
Shri Mataji: He didn’t follow your question.

00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.540
YOGI: The second question!

00:49:53.540 --> 00:49:58.600
Shri Mataji: But the – please be seated.
Please be seated. All right? Now you asked

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:04.420
a question which is intelligent and a good
question should be asked about the consciousness

00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:13.250
of it. If you want to know I’ll tell you
now about it, but it is a big lecture on it

00:50:13.250 --> 00:50:21.220
and the other day in New York I talked to
Jungians about the conscious, the subconscious,

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:31.080
the collective subconscious, but you will
know all about it, everything! So I think

00:50:31.080 --> 00:50:38.260
instead of wasting too much time on it, even
by knowing that, unless and until you get

00:50:38.260 --> 00:50:47.970
your Realization it is of no use. All right?
So the first thing is, you get your Realization

00:50:47.970 --> 00:50:56.420
and then you will know all about it. I must
have given at least ten lectures on the construction

00:50:56.420 --> 00:51:03.370
of unconscious and the conscious and the subconscious
and the collective subconscious and the collective

00:51:03.370 --> 00:51:09.000
supra-conscious and everything. All right?
That’s a very good thing you have asked

00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:17.650
Me but just now in an introductory lecture
I would not like to talk much about it. But

00:51:17.650 --> 00:51:23.010
there are lectures and lectures and lectures
and they will be all available to you. But

00:51:23.010 --> 00:51:31.580
I have to tell you one simple thing that it
is not the mental knowledge, it is the love

00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:46.240
of God. I am here to introduce you to His
love. He is God Almighty, He is our Father,

00:51:46.240 --> 00:51:55.230
and He loves us very much and He wants us
to enter into His kingdom as soon as possible.

00:51:55.230 --> 00:52:04.220
Then He looks after you every moment of your
life. And you are amazed at the miracles,

00:52:04.220 --> 00:52:11.730
how He is bothered about you – this is what
you must have first.

00:52:11.730 --> 00:52:17.480
I would say if you are hungry you’ll say,
“All right Mother, if You have done the

00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:22.690
cooking let me have the food.” But if you
are not, then you would like to know this

00:52:22.690 --> 00:52:33.330
way, that way – what’s the use? Better
have the taste of it and then you will know

00:52:33.330 --> 00:52:39.370
each and everything. You will know the people
who have been realized souls before, what

00:52:39.370 --> 00:52:48.190
they talked, explanation of everything. Without
that you don’t have the subtle eyes, the

00:52:48.190 --> 00:52:56.710
sukshma to see the subtleties of what they
said. So, best thing is to get that light

00:52:56.710 --> 00:53:03.869
into your eyes, all right? So let us now stop
the questioning – it’s nine o’clock

00:53:03.869 --> 00:53:11.710
and it’s better to have it because you didn’t
know how the time was passing and the Realization

00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:16.869
has to be done and I would like to meet all
of you. If you give Me time I would like to

00:53:16.869 --> 00:53:24.590
meet you, but in case if we spend our time
in only questioning, how can I meet you?

00:53:24.590 --> 00:53:25.650
REALISATION:

00:53:25.650 --> 00:53:33.850
A few things have to be done, very simple.
Those who don’t want to do it can go. You

00:53:33.850 --> 00:53:42.590
cannot force on them. It has to be done in
your own freedom and glory. And if you don’t

00:53:42.590 --> 00:53:50.140
want to have it’s your own choice. Nothing
can be forced, this is a divine blessing which

00:53:50.140 --> 00:53:58.830
has to be asked for. As Christ has said, we
have to knock – in the same way. So it works

00:53:58.830 --> 00:54:04.810
on the principle that we are all computers
and you have to ask a question to a computer

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:12.890
like Me and then you get the answers as the
Kundalini awakening – to explain it more

00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:21.220
sort of in a scientific thing. But it is a
very simple method that we have to take and

00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:27.920
you have to help your centers also. As it
is it works spontaneously, no doubt, but if

00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:35.859
we can little bit help our centers it expedites
and later on, if you go home, you can also

00:54:35.859 --> 00:54:40.710
work it out yourself. It’s a very simple
thing is – I don’t know how far he has

00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:47.040
told you about the channels, but the left
side represents your emotional side and your

00:54:47.040 --> 00:54:55.970
desire to get Realization. And the right side
is the action that you have to take. So first

00:54:55.970 --> 00:55:03.180
of all we have to take the help of the Mother
Earth, and also the shoes sometimes block

00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:10.180
the awakening, so it’s better to take out
the shoes for a while, just for a short time.

00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:15.010
It will hardly take ten minutes, hardly ten
minutes.

00:55:15.010 --> 00:55:25.890
Put both the feet on the ground parallel to
each other, just parallel to each other and

00:55:25.890 --> 00:55:31.250
you have to be comfortable. You have to be
comfortable, if there is something you find

00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:39.310
rather tight on your body you can little bit
release the tightness and be comfortable.

00:55:39.310 --> 00:55:45.630
If somebody wants to go out for a while can
go and come back. This - I’ll wait for them

00:55:45.630 --> 00:55:52.270
in case because it is something that has to
work out, it has to work out and I am sure

00:55:52.270 --> 00:56:41.170
it will.

00:56:41.170 --> 00:56:52.450
Now one has to know that Realization is not
complete unless and until your connection

00:56:52.450 --> 00:57:03.290
is established. So maybe today it will break
through in My presence – but you have to

00:57:03.290 --> 00:57:12.370
establish and you have to know all about it
because the light which is enlightened has

00:57:12.370 --> 00:57:19.849
to give light to others, must give light to
others, it’s very simple.

00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:25.330
Now I’m coming to Toronto, I was told after
six years. Of course next year I’m going

00:57:25.330 --> 00:57:32.390
to come definitely, no doubt, but still it
is you who are going to give Realization to

00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:40.170
others, it is you who are going to transform
the people here – it’s your responsibility.

00:57:40.170 --> 00:57:47.490
There’s no commitment of money, there’s
no commitment of anything whatsoever – except

00:57:47.490 --> 00:57:54.090
that the commitment that we have got the light
and we have to give and once you start giving

00:57:54.090 --> 00:58:01.710
others you’ll be surprised that your spiritual
growth will be very fast. But if you do not

00:58:01.710 --> 00:58:07.800
give to others you will be [stranded ?] and
you will not know why it is happening.

00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:14.890
Second thing is very simple about modern Sahaja
Yoga we should say that first you get your

00:58:14.890 --> 00:58:21.990
Realization, first you get a little light
within yourself and in that light you see

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:27.530
what’s wrong with you and you yourself drop
it. Say people have given up drugs – I have

00:58:27.530 --> 00:58:34.050
not told them, they have given up so many
things I’ve never told them, it just works

00:58:34.050 --> 00:58:42.210
because your own Kundalini works it out and
grants these blessings to you. But you must

00:58:42.210 --> 00:58:51.040
show full respect to your Self Realization
and you must show that gratitude of Divine

00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.530
that you are going to spread it.

00:58:54.530 --> 00:59:01.830
We talk about so many things, disastrous things
but how much we can contribute by Realization

00:59:01.830 --> 00:59:10.570
you do not know. As soon as you will start
using your vibrations for giving Realizations

00:59:10.570 --> 00:59:18.080
to other people and meeting collectively,
understanding it - you’ll be amazed, the

00:59:18.080 --> 00:59:21.290
whole atmosphere will start changing.

00:59:21.290 --> 00:59:31.280
I didn’t tell you how much these vibrations
help for health but also for all the agriculture,

00:59:31.280 --> 00:59:38.760
animals, everything. It’s such a wonderful
thing that three doctors in Delhi have got

00:59:38.760 --> 00:59:50.090
their MD who have done research on three subjects
– one is the physical fitness, second is

00:59:50.090 --> 00:59:58.230
the epilepsy and third psychosomatic diseases.
In Delhi-University they have done it.

00:59:58.230 --> 01:00:04.250
Now there are seven doctors in London who
are doing – not, it’s not research but

01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:11.330
recording how many people are cured by Sahaja
Yoga. We have definitely cured the disease

01:00:11.330 --> 01:00:15.500
you are talking about, definitely! And many
people have been cured.

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:24.810
There is an architect who was described as
dead – that, I mean doctors had certified

01:00:24.810 --> 01:00:31.150
that you are going to die within one month’s
time, and he was saved by an English Sahaja

01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:37.150
Yogini. She saved him just by telling him
how to meditate.

01:00:37.150 --> 01:00:43.890
So one has to first get Realization and then
believe in yourself and then you’ll believe

01:00:43.890 --> 01:00:49.890
in Sahaja Yoga. There’s no blind faith needed,
you have to first experience. Once you have

01:00:49.890 --> 01:00:56.890
the experience then yourself being honest,
you will do it. So actually I’m fulfilling

01:00:56.890 --> 01:01:03.270
all the prophecies of all the saints, all
the desires of all the prophets and all that

01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:10.599
was asked for – that’s a very difficult
task. It needs lot of patience, understanding

01:01:10.599 --> 01:01:18.000
and love. You see it’s easy to get crucified,
I tell you, even easier to take some poison

01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:26.960
and to take some Samadhi, but to work it out,
day in and day out – it’s a difficult

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:32.600
task and you really need a Mother. If it was
a Krishna, He would have used his sudarshana

01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:39.560
chakra and Rama would have taken his [vanvyasa
?]. But I have to live with you, I have to

01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:48.070
deal with you and I have to work it out and
My love has such a force that it doesn’t

01:01:48.070 --> 01:01:55.790
get tired, it doesn’t get tired at all.
I wish you all love yourself the same way

01:01:55.790 --> 01:01:58.470
and understand your own glory.

01:01:58.470 --> 01:02:06.660
At the very outset we have to understand not
to feel guilty at all about anything whatsoever,

01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:13.090
because you forget your past. Not to feel
guilty. You are not to say that you have done

01:02:13.090 --> 01:02:19.940
this wrong, that wrong, not to count any mistakes.
After all you are human beings and only human

01:02:19.940 --> 01:02:25.290
beings can make mistakes. You are not God!
So there is nothing to condemn yourself for

01:02:25.290 --> 01:02:31.180
anything, because now if you have to enter
into the kingdom of God why should you condemn

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:39.760
yourself? You should be in a very pleasant
mood towards yourself, very pleasantly placed

01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:45.420
and know that you are a human being and a
little journey has to be done. It’s very

01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:51.820
simple, I really tell you it’s very simple,
so do not go into any depression. Or some

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:56.700
people also feel all the time, “Will I get
it or not?” You will all get it, I tell

01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:04.770
you, I verily say you’ll all get it, but
don’t be diffident about it. With this let

01:03:04.770 --> 01:03:05.770
us start now.

01:03:05.770 --> 01:03:09.920
I’ll tell you, you put your left hand towards
Me like this to begin with, later on we’ll

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:16.490
go into a real awakening but just now I’ll
tell you how to do it. Left hand towards Me,

01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:22.000
symbolically you are expressing your desire
that you want to have your Self Realization.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.840
Then your right hand you put it on your heart,
which is a center where resides the Spirit.

01:03:29.840 --> 01:03:38.040
In human beings it resides in the heart, so
first we put it in the heart. Then we put

01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:43.880
our hand on the upper part of our abdomen
on the left-hand side. We work out everything

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:51.400
on the left-hand side. Now here is the center
of your mastery, which is created by all the

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:59.150
prophets and all the masters for us. So here
you place it in the upper part of your abdomen

01:03:59.150 --> 01:04:05.890
on the left-hand side. Then you place it in
the lower part of your abdomen, in the lower

01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:11.430
part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.
This is a very important center because this

01:04:11.430 --> 01:04:19.590
is the center which manifests true knowledge
on your nervous system. So this is also a

01:04:19.590 --> 01:04:27.560
very important center. Then you raise your
Kundalini by putting your hand on, again on

01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:34.450
the center of the master that is the upper
part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:04:34.450 --> 01:04:35.770
Press it hard.

01:04:35.770 --> 01:04:46.510
Now. Then you press again your hand on your
heart. Now, you take your hand and put it

01:04:46.510 --> 01:04:55.450
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder
and turn your head to your right. This is

01:04:55.450 --> 01:05:02.120
the center you catch when you feel guilty.
You feel diffident and you try to debase yourself,

01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:09.780
this is the center you catch. So you put your
hand to your right, your hand on the left

01:05:09.780 --> 01:05:14.170
side but your head to your right.

01:05:14.170 --> 01:05:25.000
Now, stretch your hand and put the center
of your palm on - I’m sorry, then you have

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:39.230
to put your hand on the forehead, across.
Now this is the center – and bend your head

01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:51.460
- where you have to ask for forgiveness for
others, means you have to say, “I forgive

01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:58.760
everyone.” Now some will say that it’s
very difficult to forgive, but whether you

01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:07.150
forgive or you don’t forgive, it’s a myth.
So, if you don’t forgive then you play into

01:06:07.150 --> 01:06:13.600
wrong hands. So better is to forgive. I find
it’s very difficult for people to forgive

01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:18.940
others, even to say that and then, when they
come to Me I find they have not forgiven and

01:06:18.940 --> 01:06:23.470
they have not felt the vibrations. So from
your heart you have to forgive when I tell

01:06:23.470 --> 01:06:32.890
you. Now put your hand on the backside of
your head and push back your head on it. Here

01:06:32.890 --> 01:06:41.340
you have to ask for forgiveness from Divine,
without counting your mistakes, without feeling

01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:44.010
guilty, just for your satisfaction.

01:06:44.010 --> 01:06:50.710
Now you have to stretch your hand and put
the center of your palm on top of your head,

01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:57.680
bending your head, just here where there’s
a fontanel bone area which was a soft bone

01:06:57.680 --> 01:07:06.109
in your childhood. So put your right hand
on top of that and press it hard, pushing

01:07:06.109 --> 01:07:14.800
back your fingers and move your scalp clockwise
slowly. Seven times you have to move, but

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:25.020
that I’ll tell you later on after you close
your eyes, just now you move it seven times.

01:07:25.020 --> 01:07:42.109
Now you may have to close your eyes. Please
don’t open your eyes because there’s no

01:07:42.109 --> 01:07:49.720
mesmerism in it. Moreover your attention has
to be drawn inside, so it‘s better to close

01:07:49.720 --> 01:07:57.490
your eyes, it will help you a lot, if you
keep your eyes closed till I tell you to open.

01:07:57.490 --> 01:08:04.420
Now please place your left hand towards Me,
and now close your eyes, keep your feet apart,

01:08:04.420 --> 01:08:10.950
and put your right hand on your heart and
close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles

01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:18.230
also because it helps your eyesight.

01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:24.529
Now when you have put your hand on your heart
you have to ask Me a very important question,

01:08:24.529 --> 01:08:29.839
you may call Me Shri Mataji, if you can, or
you can call Me Mother – whichever suits

01:08:29.839 --> 01:08:39.929
you, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask this
question three times. In your heart ask the

01:08:39.929 --> 01:08:55.049
question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

01:08:55.049 --> 01:09:03.380
If you are the Spirit then you are your guide,
you are your master and all the prophets have

01:09:03.380 --> 01:09:10.520
built in a center in your being on the left-hand
side of your abdomen in the upper part. You

01:09:10.520 --> 01:09:19.850
place your hand and press it hard and here
you ask Me another question three times, “Mother,

01:09:19.850 --> 01:09:34.849
am I
my master? Mother, am I my guide?” Ask this

01:09:34.849 --> 01:09:47.929
question three times.

01:09:47.929 --> 01:10:07.219
Now please put your right hand in the lower
part of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:10:07.219 --> 01:10:15.229
As I told you this is the center of pure knowledge
which manifests on your central nervous system,

01:10:15.229 --> 01:10:29.989
but I cannot force on you. You are free to
choose. I respect your freedom, so unless

01:10:29.989 --> 01:10:38.590
and until you ask Me I cannot bestow anything
like that or force you to accept anything.

01:10:38.590 --> 01:10:56.940
So you have to say, ”Mother, please give
me pure knowledge.” Please say it six times,

01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:03.179
because this center has got six petals.

01:11:03.179 --> 01:11:17.139
When you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini
starts moving upward. So we have to open the

01:11:17.139 --> 01:11:31.170
upper centers with our self-confidence. Raise
your right hand in the upper part of the abdomen

01:11:31.170 --> 01:11:44.739
on the left-hand side and say with full confidence
in yourself ten times, “Mother, I am my

01:11:44.739 --> 01:11:56.070
own master.” Please say it ten times.

01:11:56.070 --> 01:12:16.590
Now the greatest truth about you is that you
are not this body, you are not this mind,

01:12:16.590 --> 01:12:26.539
you are not this intellect, you are not your
conditioning, you are not your emotions, you

01:12:26.539 --> 01:12:36.910
are not your ego but you are the Spirit. So
please raise your hand on your heart again

01:12:36.910 --> 01:12:45.500
and say with full confidence twelve times,
“Mother, I am the Spirit.” Please say

01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:51.959
it twelve times without doubting yourself.
Please say it with full confidence twelve

01:12:51.959 --> 01:13:04.599
times, “Mother, I am the spirit”, which
you are.

01:13:04.599 --> 01:13:22.869
Now we have to know that the Divine is the
ocean of love and knowledge, it is the ocean

01:13:22.869 --> 01:13:32.310
of compassion and bliss, but above all it
is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever

01:13:32.310 --> 01:13:43.010
mistakes we have committed can be easily dissolved
by that ocean. So we have to forgive ourselves

01:13:43.010 --> 01:13:55.010
and we have to put our hand in the corner
of our shoulder and our neck and turn our

01:13:55.010 --> 01:14:04.499
head to our right and here with full confidence
we have to say sixteen times, full confidence,

01:14:04.499 --> 01:14:10.719
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Please
say it with full confidence: You are not!

01:14:10.719 --> 01:14:16.719
Let the Kundalini judge you, you don’t judge
yourself and condemn yourself. Now put your

01:14:16.719 --> 01:14:28.979
hand as far as you can, take it towards your
spinal cord and turn your head to your right.

01:14:28.979 --> 01:14:44.519
As I have told you that we have to forgive
everyone. You don’t have to remember whom

01:14:44.519 --> 01:14:50.590
you have to forgive, what they have done to
you, what is their mistake and why they have

01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:56.400
tortured you – nothing is to be remembered.
At this present moment we have to know that

01:14:56.400 --> 01:15:03.309
we have to forgive them and this is the greatest
weapon we have got, that we can forgive everyone

01:15:03.309 --> 01:15:09.289
by which we neutralize them completely. They
cannot be effective on us. And let the Divine

01:15:09.289 --> 01:15:15.620
look after them. So now here you put your
hand on your forehead across and bend your

01:15:15.620 --> 01:15:24.289
head and press it hard on both the sides.
Here you have to say from your heart, not

01:15:24.289 --> 01:15:31.459
how many times, “Mother I forgive everyone.”
Believe Me – only saying this from your

01:15:31.459 --> 01:15:44.729
heart you’ll feel very much relieved, very
much relieved. Please say that, “Mother,

01:15:44.729 --> 01:15:48.539
I forgive everyone.”

01:15:48.539 --> 01:15:57.320
Now take back your hand, put it on the back
side of your head, what you call as the [optical

01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:04.479
?] area and push your head on top of it and
let it rest on it and here you have to say

01:16:04.479 --> 01:16:14.519
without thinking about your guilt, your mistakes,
on anything, just for your satisfaction you

01:16:14.519 --> 01:16:20.809
have to say, “Oh Divine, if we have done
any mistakes, if I have done any mistakes,

01:16:20.809 --> 01:16:36.710
please forgive Me.” Is for your satisfaction,
but please do not try to find false with yourself.

01:16:36.710 --> 01:16:48.070
Now stretch your hand, and the center of your
hand please put it on to the soft bone that

01:16:48.070 --> 01:16:56.659
was in your childhood called as fontanel bone
area and press it hard, bending your head,

01:16:56.659 --> 01:17:04.310
push back your fingers. And now you have to
move it seven times, very slowly clockwise.

01:17:04.310 --> 01:17:13.459
But before that I’m sorry that I cannot
cross your freedom. In your freedom you have

01:17:13.459 --> 01:17:19.260
to ask for your Self Realization. It cannot
be forced, it’s too precious to be forced

01:17:19.260 --> 01:17:27.250
on anyone, so you have to say that, “Mother,
please give me my Self Realization.” And

01:17:27.250 --> 01:19:46.849
move it seven times slowly clockwise, pressing

01:19:46.849 --> 01:21:43.099
it

01:21:43.099 --> 01:22:55.939
very hard, pushing back

01:22:55.939 --> 01:28:00.349
your fingers, slowly, very slowly – please
do it.
