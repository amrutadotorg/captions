00:02:21.653 --> 00:02:27.856
We have had Bhairava Puja in Belgium

00:02:28.057 --> 00:02:33.984
and now I thought today let us have Mahakali Puja

00:02:34.184 --> 00:02:41.127
because yesterday's experience, last night's experience,

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:45.312
was the work of Mahakali.

00:02:45.513 --> 00:02:53.196
She has a double role all the time, she's at two extremes.

00:02:53.396 --> 00:03:04.049
On one side she is full of joy, giver of joy,

00:03:05.284 --> 00:03:10.418
she's very happy when she sees her disciple are joyous.

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:14.103
Joy is her own quality, is her energy,

00:03:14.304 --> 00:03:17.809
and yesterday you must have been amazed to see

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:25.457
so many middle-aged ladies of France smiling and laughing.

00:03:25.657 --> 00:03:27.828
I'd never seen them smiling;

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:33.159
it's very surprising how they were so joyous

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:38.820
and so very happy and this is the energy of Mahakali

00:03:39.021 --> 00:03:42.804
that gives you all that joy after Realization

00:03:43.005 --> 00:03:45.992
and the joy you enjoy among yourselves,

00:03:46.193 --> 00:03:49.875
all these are the qualities of Mahakali

00:03:50.076 --> 00:03:54.266
and when they will read out the names of Mahakali

00:03:54.467 --> 00:04:04.227
you will know how her powers manifest in Sahaja Yoga

00:04:04.428 --> 00:04:07.055
and how it has helped you all

00:04:07.256 --> 00:04:11.053
to get drenched into the Ocean of Joy.

00:04:15.695 --> 00:04:27.158
To begin with I have to tell you one thing that

00:04:27.359 --> 00:04:30.580
Mahakali Puja, when you are doing,

00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:35.640
you have to feel a joy within yourself,

00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:41.219
and joy from other Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.420
If you, if you cannot feel that, that means you are not yet grown

00:04:47.857 --> 00:04:52.163
and there's some problem, maybe with your parents,

00:04:52.364 --> 00:04:54.905
maybe with your children, maybe it's family, with your country,

00:04:55.106 --> 00:04:58.336
whatever it is but there's some sort of a conditioning

00:04:58.537 --> 00:05:02.070
which is working out that doesn't give you that joy.

00:05:05.817 --> 00:05:12.636
And to grow into Sahaja Yoga is very important,

00:05:12.837 --> 00:05:14.657
which I think people don't understand,

00:05:14.858 --> 00:05:19.245
even if they live in ashrams, they don't understand one thing,

00:05:19.446 --> 00:05:22.079
that you have to be collective.

00:05:23.352 --> 00:05:28.721
If you are not collective then you are thrown out, gradually.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:36.827
Now this Mahakali power has got seven strings you can say this,

00:05:38.718 --> 00:05:41.085
and these strings are there to throw you out

00:05:41.286 --> 00:05:44.124
into collective subconscious (next couple of words inaudible).

00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:48.403
Like as in the sitar you have seen for the resonance,

00:05:48.604 --> 00:05:50.962
there are other strings also.

00:05:52.643 --> 00:05:55.296
So once you start getting out of the collectivity

00:05:55.497 --> 00:06:03.163
it is the Mahakali Herself, picks you out and starts throwing you out,

00:06:03.364 --> 00:06:07.172
slowly slowly to the subconscious area

00:06:07.373 --> 00:06:10.849
and where you just disappear.

00:06:11.787 --> 00:06:14.833
And all kinds of problems start,

00:06:16.256 --> 00:06:19.465
I have seen this happening in every country,

00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:25.097
that people who do not attend the collective meditation.

00:06:25.298 --> 00:06:29.376
For France I have the same report

00:06:29.954 --> 00:06:36.657
and I think the people who do not grow will be thrown out.

00:06:38.493 --> 00:06:42.263
Sahaja Yoga, as you know, has a double action,

00:06:42.464 --> 00:06:45.291
as the Mahakali has a double action.

00:06:45.815 --> 00:06:47.893
She's extremely loving, full of joy,

00:06:48.094 --> 00:06:52.737
full of happiness and She's the one who's extremely cruel, wrathful,

00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:56.846
She's the one who's the slayer of all the demons and the evil,

00:06:57.047 --> 00:07:01.503
and those people who try to do evil.

00:07:01.704 --> 00:07:04.603
So once you are thrown out into the left side

00:07:04.822 --> 00:07:06.994
then you can imagine, you can develop any kind

00:07:07.195 --> 00:07:09.112
of left-side diseases to begin with,

00:07:09.313 --> 00:07:11.899
Mooladhara diseases are the worst,

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:16.976
you develop diseases like mellitus, this, er, er,

00:07:17.177 --> 00:07:20.190
you must have heard of the disabilities caused

00:07:20.391 --> 00:07:23.804
by the muscles getting degenerated.

00:07:24.005 --> 00:07:28.005
All muscular degeneration comes from this problem.

00:07:30.396 --> 00:07:33.146
So at any cost that must be avoided.

00:07:36.092 --> 00:07:40.188
But if you are not in the collective, if you do not understand the collective,

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.518
and if you are out of the collective

00:07:43.734 --> 00:07:48.171
you'll be surprised that negative forces will join together

00:07:48.372 --> 00:07:51.121
and they'll pull you out.

00:07:51.321 --> 00:07:54.681
So this is one of the things that happens,

00:07:56.127 --> 00:08:02.522
so be very careful that don't avoid the collective programmes.

00:08:05.734 --> 00:08:11.086
The, another problem about Mahakali is that,

00:08:11.287 --> 00:08:15.015
that She's the one who gives you the feeling

00:08:15.216 --> 00:08:20.447
for your wife, for your husband,

00:08:20.648 --> 00:08:24.244
She is the one.

00:08:25.677 --> 00:08:30.153
Now there also, the same problem.

00:08:30.354 --> 00:08:38.043
If both of them are alright, She's alright

00:08:38.244 --> 00:08:42.902
but if She finds any one of them going astray

00:08:43.103 --> 00:08:46.275
She'll throw that person out and out and out

00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:48.687
and the, another person, if that person is attached

00:08:48.888 --> 00:08:53.734
to that person also will be thrown out. So this business of falling in love,

00:08:53.935 --> 00:08:56.484
this nonsense that we have here, that you fall in love,

00:08:56.685 --> 00:08:59.741
but the word is all right because you fall really in love.

00:08:59.942 --> 00:09:02.082
It's a real falling happens.

00:09:03.434 --> 00:09:06.193
So what happens when you start falling in love,

00:09:06.394 --> 00:09:09.506
there's a kind of a maya of this Mahakali

00:09:09.707 --> 00:09:13.027
and you just get infatuated, your ego gets pampered,

00:09:13.228 --> 00:09:16.527
or something like that, or you have certain ideas of a wife

00:09:16.728 --> 00:09:20.329
or something and then you think 'Oh, that's the one for me.'

00:09:22.056 --> 00:09:25.411
So in these cases only two things can happen;

00:09:25.612 --> 00:09:28.560
either you can be lost completely because of

00:09:28.761 --> 00:09:32.827
your wife or your husband whom you adore and admire

00:09:33.028 --> 00:09:36.417
and you, you've finished, I mean your personality is finished.

00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:42.321
Or else, the another thing which is even more serious is that,

00:09:42.522 --> 00:09:45.522
that you'll completely break forever and hate each other.

00:09:45.624 --> 00:09:49.824
That's why they say that there's a love and hate relationship.

00:09:50.025 --> 00:09:52.626
How can love be hate?

00:09:53.806 --> 00:09:59.597
But it becomes, because of the, this quality of the Goddess

00:09:59.798 --> 00:10:03.495
that She is on one side extremely loving,

00:10:03.696 --> 00:10:07.664
extremely kind, extremely soft,

00:10:07.864 --> 00:10:10.333
she goes up to a point.

00:10:11.208 --> 00:10:14.038
And then She throws you on the other side,

00:10:14.239 --> 00:10:18.522
and that is why in these countries where people always fall in love, you see,

00:10:18.723 --> 00:10:23.495
they don't marry otherwise, unless and until they have fallen in love.

00:10:23.848 --> 00:10:26.648
In that they cross all the maryadas also.

00:10:27.585 --> 00:10:29.853
In falling in love they will marry somebody

00:10:30.054 --> 00:10:34.236
who is already married or who is, they'll carry on with somebody

00:10:34.437 --> 00:10:38.889
who is not yet divorced

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:43.846
or also they will have marriages, er, among themselves

00:10:44.046 --> 00:10:46.656
in the same household or something.

00:10:46.857 --> 00:10:48.755
All kinds of things they do and the old woman

00:10:48.956 --> 00:10:52.291
marries a young man or a young, er,

00:10:52.502 --> 00:10:54.393
old man marries a young girl, like that,

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:57.569
all nonsensical things, without any maryadas.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:01.022
And they do not stick together, they have no maryadas.

00:11:01.382 --> 00:11:07.405
To marry is to create a maryada, maryada of your behaviour

00:11:07.606 --> 00:11:10.190
and this is the maryada which, if you do not keep,

00:11:10.449 --> 00:11:14.466
er, keep, then this Mahakali gets into it.

00:11:14.667 --> 00:11:17.974
So first of all one has to be collective,

00:11:18.222 --> 00:11:19.511
the ones who are not collective,

00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:23.341
who do not attend every time a collective programme.

00:11:23.542 --> 00:11:25.060
You might give suggestions,

00:11:25.261 --> 00:11:27.768
that you would like to come for such and such thing.

00:11:28.123 --> 00:11:30.602
For example, I have already explained,

00:11:30.803 --> 00:11:33.570
that you shouldn't talk, put my,

00:11:33.771 --> 00:11:36.828
there are so many tapes which they have not, never heard.

00:11:37.029 --> 00:11:40.258
List...let them listen to my tape then go into meditation

00:11:40.459 --> 00:11:42.984
and then do the aarti and finish it off.

00:11:43.185 --> 00:11:46.202
Because these tapes are to be heard again and again.

00:11:46.403 --> 00:11:50.928
Now those who get any questions out of those tapes

00:11:51.129 --> 00:11:55.092
can, next time, discuss it before starting the tapes.

00:11:55.293 --> 00:11:59.762
That's a very good thing and that works. In India nobody speaks,

00:11:59.963 --> 00:12:03.785
they just put my tapes on or show my video,

00:12:03.986 --> 00:12:10.006
after that they just have meditation and aarti. Finished.

00:12:10.207 --> 00:12:13.241
After that nobody talks. But before starting it,

00:12:13.442 --> 00:12:18.436
they do it is to talk to each other and discuss the problems

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:25.331
or discuss anything that they felt about the previous programme.

00:12:25.532 --> 00:12:28.065
Because you have not come here to marry someone

00:12:28.266 --> 00:12:30.891
or to fall in love into something.

00:12:32.289 --> 00:12:34.628
You have not come here to get after some woman

00:12:34.829 --> 00:12:38.408
because she's your wife or some man because he's your husband.

00:12:38.609 --> 00:12:42.609
You have had so many husbands and wives in previous lives.

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:46.757
But you have come here for your ascent;

00:12:49.406 --> 00:12:50.997
and if you have come here for your ascent

00:12:51.198 --> 00:12:54.992
you have to keep a watch. How is your mind working?

00:12:55.984 --> 00:12:58.681
Supposing I say that you should have good married life,

00:12:58.882 --> 00:13:02.643
of course, I do say, you should have good married life.

00:13:02.844 --> 00:13:06.297
But not at the cost of losing your ascent.

00:13:08.404 --> 00:13:13.617
It has happened with people, we have lost a complete,

00:13:13.818 --> 00:13:16.203
I should say, a city like that.

00:13:16.404 --> 00:13:19.552
Such stupidity came, comes up over people.

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:23.403
So be careful not to get lost,

00:13:23.604 --> 00:13:27.348
you have not come here to have only a happy married life

00:13:27.549 --> 00:13:31.504
but happy married life is just one step.

00:13:31.705 --> 00:13:34.231
But if that step is taking you away

00:13:34.432 --> 00:13:39.119
from the real path of your ascent is better to be careful.

00:13:43.416 --> 00:13:48.262
Also we must understand the innocence means purity,

00:13:48.463 --> 00:13:50.717
purity of thought. As I explained yesterday

00:13:50.918 --> 00:13:53.913
I hope you understood the meaning of purity.

00:13:54.114 --> 00:13:58.972
Purity is to be understood much more by Europeans.

00:13:59.173 --> 00:14:04.173
Very important. Specially French.

00:14:06.930 --> 00:14:09.734
Because the whole society is suffering.

00:14:10.861 --> 00:14:17.152
Society can only be pure if the family life is pure.

00:14:17.353 --> 00:14:23.269
Not only that but your relations with each other are pure.

00:14:23.470 --> 00:14:27.470
Like I was told that somebody fell in love in Ganapatipule.

00:14:27.681 --> 00:14:30.180
I mean you go for a pilgrimage.

00:14:31.126 --> 00:14:34.204
It's like you have to go to buy a sari and you

00:14:34.405 --> 00:14:39.006
end up with a shaving stick.

00:14:39.207 --> 00:14:40.842
It's that stupid.

00:14:41.043 --> 00:14:46.259
You are coming to Ganapatipule for a, for what?

00:14:46.923 --> 00:14:58.327
You are coming there for your ascent, it's a pilgrimage.

00:14:58.528 --> 00:15:00.621
But in the pilgrimage I've never heard anybody

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:05.429
falls in love with each other and goes to marriage.

00:15:05.630 --> 00:15:10.046
So this bhoot of falling in love must be given up in Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:10.247 --> 00:15:12.032
that is one of the biggest loads.

00:15:12.233 --> 00:15:16.545
And, and must understand that purity means chastity.

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:23.468
Innocence means chastity,

00:15:23.669 --> 00:15:27.099
not only physical also mental chastity.

00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:32.181
You have to have mental chastity,

00:15:32.382 --> 00:15:37.296
if you don't have mental chastity you cannot ascend.

00:15:38.117 --> 00:15:45.336
Actually in the West it is more mental that physical, is a fact.

00:15:48.383 --> 00:15:51.922
And that's why their brains (inaudible?) have gone off.

00:15:52.123 --> 00:15:55.756
And they are becoming just like, I think, potatoes now, I think.

00:15:56.397 --> 00:15:59.289
Because if you go on mentally imagining

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:02.427
and playing around and working it out this way,

00:16:02.628 --> 00:16:04.833
it's going to be absolutely dangerous

00:16:05.034 --> 00:16:08.294
because it's all imagination, it has nothing to do with reality.

00:16:08.495 --> 00:16:11.037
The more you get into this kind of a nonsense

00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:14.214
the more you become away from reality.

00:16:14.824 --> 00:16:16.935
That never means you should be dry,

00:16:17.136 --> 00:16:21.285
it never means you should be, er,

00:16:21.486 --> 00:16:24.231
negligent of your responsibility, does not mean.

00:16:24.432 --> 00:16:27.883
As I said, the sap...

00:16:41.233 --> 00:16:49.451
As I've said that the sap in the tree rises, all right?

00:16:49.652 --> 00:16:54.615
Then it purifies, it nourishes

00:16:54.816 --> 00:16:59.233
every part of the plant separately in a different way.

00:16:59.434 --> 00:17:03.803
Like it's a mother, so mother, father, is a father,

00:17:04.004 --> 00:17:09.363
sister, is a sister, brother, is a sister, brother is a brother.

00:17:09.564 --> 00:17:12.402
The brother-sister relations

00:17:12.603 --> 00:17:18.735
cannot become husband-wife relations. How can it be?

00:17:26.579 --> 00:17:31.495
Now what happens really is that such a confusion in the mind

00:17:31.696 --> 00:17:37.210
and it has created tremendous problems for us.

00:17:40.054 --> 00:17:45.298
Then the sap nourishes all these things and comes back.

00:17:46.822 --> 00:17:49.457
It doesn't get attached to something:

00:17:49.658 --> 00:17:53.285
'Oh, she's my wife so the first priority is my wife.'

00:17:53.486 --> 00:17:56.441
Because I've said, of course, family life has to be all right,

00:17:56.642 --> 00:17:58.923
you must look after your family life.

00:17:59.791 --> 00:18:02.973
But that doesn't mean that you make everything suffer,

00:18:03.174 --> 00:18:06.033
that doesn't mean that your ascent should be finished.

00:18:06.244 --> 00:18:08.369
Cannot be that.

00:18:09.401 --> 00:18:12.059
You are not like ordinary people, you are saints

00:18:12.260 --> 00:18:15.603
and for the saints the main thing is their ascent,

00:18:15.814 --> 00:18:21.238
not their family life, not their material possessions, nothing.

00:18:21.439 --> 00:18:24.789
Nor their children, but their ascent, once they ascend

00:18:24.990 --> 00:18:29.103
everything will ascend with it.

00:18:35.063 --> 00:18:42.055
Now the understanding of chastity should be there.

00:18:42.315 --> 00:18:45.216
It can come to you very easily if you ascend,

00:18:45.417 --> 00:18:48.425
it's such a vicious circle.

00:18:48.626 --> 00:18:51.282
It is such a vicious circle.

00:18:51.483 --> 00:18:55.483
Now first of all you get your Realization, all right.

00:18:57.522 --> 00:19:03.728
Now you must know that Kundalini itself is the Mahakali shakti

00:19:04.229 --> 00:19:06.358
because she's the primordial.

00:19:06.559 --> 00:19:10.559
Mahakali shakti is the primordial shakti within us.

00:19:10.856 --> 00:19:13.856
And is the Kundalini is the Mahakali shakti.

00:19:15.668 --> 00:19:19.965
And she remains as a virgin within you.

00:19:20.166 --> 00:19:23.540
Means She's purity, She has a power to purify.

00:19:25.556 --> 00:19:33.036
All that happens when you get your Realization.

00:19:33.318 --> 00:19:39.075
She starts manifesting Her all beautiful aspects on you.

00:19:41.686 --> 00:19:45.686
Now the one who's sitting there is Shri Ganesh.

00:19:48.131 --> 00:19:51.263
Now people don't understand what is innocence is.

00:19:52.972 --> 00:19:54.807
Shri Ganesha is sitting there

00:19:55.041 --> 00:20:04.099
and He is the one who resides on mooladhara,

00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:07.654
even over his Mother because He's like a guard,

00:20:07.855 --> 00:20:12.802
and He's the one who tells whether She can ascend or not.

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:18.792
Unless and until He gives permission She cannot ascend.

00:20:19.769 --> 00:20:27.209
So Shri Ganesha gives the ascending sort of, er,

00:20:28.116 --> 00:20:33.969
OK, alright, you can rise.

00:20:34.170 --> 00:20:40.966
And he stops all his work.

00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:44.876
You have seen th... Me, sitting for hours together.

00:20:45.104 --> 00:20:46.666
I don't have to go even to the bathroom

00:20:46.861 --> 00:20:50.394
or anywhere because Shri Ganesha stops all his work.

00:20:51.988 --> 00:20:55.162
He's only worried now about the ascent

00:20:55.363 --> 00:21:00.469
and on every chakra he checks your purity,

00:21:01.571 --> 00:21:05.618
and then accordingly the Kundalini tries to purify.

00:21:07.954 --> 00:21:12.551
But when it reaches the mental level,

00:21:12.752 --> 00:21:15.715
mental level has all these funny ideas of romance,

00:21:15.916 --> 00:21:18.610
this nonsense, that nonsense.

00:21:18.811 --> 00:21:21.706
I was surprised the other day,

00:21:21.907 --> 00:21:25.173
there was a girl who was having a trouble with her husband

00:21:25.374 --> 00:21:28.555
of expressing her love to her husband after marriage;

00:21:28.756 --> 00:21:31.357
before marriage she was all right.

00:21:32.326 --> 00:21:36.126
So I told her: 'Read some book where they have described

00:21:36.421 --> 00:21:40.420
the romance between husband and wife'.

00:21:41.554 --> 00:21:43.571
So she said, 'There is no book I have known.'

00:21:43.772 --> 00:21:45.415
Then I asked one professor to find out,

00:21:45.616 --> 00:21:47.549
he said there's no such book.

00:21:51.434 --> 00:21:55.278
In Sahaja Yoga the romance starts after the marriage.

00:21:56.513 --> 00:22:00.951
But also with maryadas, not at the cost of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:01.152 --> 00:22:04.013
not at the cost, cost of your ascent.

00:22:07.395 --> 00:22:09.737
So all these ideas people have in the West,

00:22:09.933 --> 00:22:12.151
I know you are so much conditioned about it.

00:22:12.324 --> 00:22:14.191
So, you say now let us see,

00:22:14.379 --> 00:22:15.935
this is some (? inaudible word) after all,

00:22:16.136 --> 00:22:19.113
we have to give all the benefit to them.

00:22:20.847 --> 00:22:24.247
Now we select people, we do everything.

00:22:25.935 --> 00:22:28.406
Is all the work of Mahakali

00:22:28.607 --> 00:22:31.289
because you have to work on the vibrations,

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:33.609
it's all the work of Mahakali.

00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:37.686
And after marriages also some marriages do fail.

00:22:38.179 --> 00:22:39.720
The reason being they do not know

00:22:39.921 --> 00:22:42.741
what is the purpose of their marriages.

00:22:50.586 --> 00:22:53.359
So the first and foremost thing of Mahakali is that

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:58.515
She is purity. Absolute purity.

00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:04.712
And that purity if we cannot imbibe within us,

00:23:04.913 --> 00:23:07.913
we cannot be Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:08.795 --> 00:23:13.172
Now this mind is so much conditioned, I know.

00:23:13.373 --> 00:23:15.498
Our children will be much better off than ourselves.

00:23:16.339 --> 00:23:20.339
Then they won't have these conditionings as we have had.

00:23:21.933 --> 00:23:24.808
And so many problems can be just avoided

00:23:25.009 --> 00:23:27.521
if you really become pure people.

00:23:28.678 --> 00:23:31.396
I see in the other society in which I move,

00:23:31.597 --> 00:23:32.859
nobody seems to be safe,

00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.669
somebody's wife is running with somebody's husband,

00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:38.372
somebody's daughter is running with somebody's father,

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:42.427
somebody's running, a boy running with somebody's mother.

00:23:43.086 --> 00:23:46.960
Next day you find somebody else standing there husband and wife.

00:23:47.172 --> 00:23:50.791
Or sometimes it's so biz...funny that you can't believe it,

00:23:50.994 --> 00:23:55.330
how can it be? And everybody's in danger.

00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.906
A man goes to the house,

00:23:58.107 --> 00:24:01.883
he finds his wife run away with another man.

00:24:02.125 --> 00:24:06.686
Or a man goes for his work, he's run away with another woman.

00:24:06.887 --> 00:24:12.441
So the, She, She's the one, She gives you stithi, the state.

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:16.050
Stithi means consolidation.

00:24:17.592 --> 00:24:23.584
Without your proper consolidation into your purity,

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:29.429
not into your romantic life, you cannot rise.

00:24:32.203 --> 00:24:34.242
Like when we make the aeroplane,

00:24:34.445 --> 00:24:37.049
first we have to consolidate it.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.135
Fix it up properly, work it out,

00:24:39.336 --> 00:24:41.752
so that when it goes in the air

00:24:41.953 --> 00:24:46.734
all its parts do not fly away with the passengers.

00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:57.238
In the same way when we are ascending Shri Ganesha does that,

00:24:57.439 --> 00:25:02.250
he just stops the action of excretion completely

00:25:02.452 --> 00:25:06.575
and the ascent starts.

00:25:07.146 --> 00:25:09.177
They are doing their work all right,

00:25:09.377 --> 00:25:11.465
despite the fact they have been insulted,

00:25:11.666 --> 00:25:14.629
they have been neglected, we have misbehaved,

00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:16.879
whatever we might have done,

00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:19.267
they are doing their jobs alright.

00:25:19.486 --> 00:25:22.832
We can see it, so many people getting their Realization.

00:25:23.033 --> 00:25:25.622
But what are we doing about it?

00:25:27.599 --> 00:25:31.075
We cannot be even collective,

00:25:33.185 --> 00:25:36.653
we cannot attend collective things.

00:25:37.393 --> 00:25:39.505
And look at them how generous they are,

00:25:39.706 --> 00:25:44.054
they are extremely collective, they are extremely collective,

00:25:44.255 --> 00:25:50.895
to such an extent to somebody supposing worships Shri Krishna.

00:25:52.231 --> 00:25:54.434
His heart will catch.

00:25:56.311 --> 00:26:00.420
Why? Because you must also worship Shiva.

00:26:04.592 --> 00:26:08.192
They are so collective and so much connected with Me.

00:26:10.468 --> 00:26:12.189
So they are all collective, in the same way

00:26:12.390 --> 00:26:16.090
you are also devas, you also should be collective.

00:26:18.905 --> 00:26:20.424
As soon as you become collective

00:26:20.625 --> 00:26:23.625
all these nonsensical things will drop out.

00:26:24.415 --> 00:26:28.040
All these ideas will drop out. You do not become collective

00:26:28.241 --> 00:26:31.733
because you have not dropped out all these things,

00:26:31.933 --> 00:26:35.711
or else you are afraid of dropping them out.

00:26:37.595 --> 00:26:39.409
So let us know what is our purpose (is?),

00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.258
our purpose is to ascend.

00:26:43.673 --> 00:26:46.873
And what is the Mahakali power is doing for us.

00:26:47.952 --> 00:26:51.842
She is giving you your ascent through Kundalini.

00:26:52.069 --> 00:26:59.662
She is purify; She's giving you all the powers.

00:27:00.038 --> 00:27:07.202
She is protecting you all the time, She is giving you joy.

00:27:08.627 --> 00:27:10.324
But what are we doing for Her?

00:27:10.525 --> 00:27:22.886
Her only, only desire is that my children should be saintly,

00:27:23.087 --> 00:27:26.687
that they should have beautiful qualities of a saint.

00:27:27.283 --> 00:27:31.016
That he doesn't fall at every woman, fall at every man.

00:27:31.385 --> 00:27:33.869
It's not so cheap, you see.

00:27:37.143 --> 00:27:39.103
And mentally specially,

00:27:41.135 --> 00:27:43.596
I mean if the Sahasrara is spoilt

00:27:43.797 --> 00:27:46.023
how can Sahaja Yoga work out?

00:27:47.664 --> 00:27:50.664
The whole play is of the Sahasrara.

00:27:53.601 --> 00:27:58.172
And that purity should manifest.

00:27:58.373 --> 00:28:02.240
Through you we are going to change the world.

00:28:02.834 --> 00:28:04.438
Through no-one else.

00:28:04.639 --> 00:28:08.039
The Sahaja Yogis who are going to change the world.

00:28:08.350 --> 00:28:12.150
Now look at the generosity, when my body is so generous.

00:28:14.147 --> 00:28:17.599
Yesterday one lady came, I think she,

00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:21.662
she had a very bad liver. She came downstairs and I,

00:28:21.863 --> 00:28:25.863
my liver started pumping vibrations, terrible.

00:28:27.417 --> 00:28:30.293
She had a very bad liver though; she had taken drugs,

00:28:30.494 --> 00:28:32.473
I mean she had taken drugs and all that suffering

00:28:32.674 --> 00:28:37.173
was done to me, by this liver of mine.

00:28:37.533 --> 00:28:42.460
It didn't think that 'Oh Mother, she's come all the way out suffering'

00:28:42.661 --> 00:28:47.538
so started just pumping for that woman.

00:28:49.265 --> 00:28:54.248
So generous it is. And they are so generous themselves

00:28:54.449 --> 00:28:56.579
the way they bestow blessings (all over?).

00:28:56.780 --> 00:29:00.695
How they are hard working, how they are running about.

00:29:01.781 --> 00:29:03.773
What are we giving them?

00:29:08.953 --> 00:29:11.648
They give us joy, they look after us,

00:29:11.849 --> 00:29:15.382
they look after our children, they look after everything,

00:29:15.583 --> 00:29:19.250
they manage everything. Now what are we doing for them?

00:29:20.523 --> 00:29:22.437
Also I've heard that people don't help

00:29:22.638 --> 00:29:24.408
when they have to do postering, they have to do,

00:29:24.609 --> 00:29:28.468
very few people come up.

00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:34.483
This is being ungrateful,
very ungrateful to those.

00:29:34.684 --> 00:29:36.846
All the deities are present

00:29:37.046 --> 00:29:40.178
when you are having those collective programmes.

00:29:42.827 --> 00:29:44.649
And surprisingly the old Sahaja Yogis

00:29:44.850 --> 00:29:48.463
are more difficult than the new ones.

00:29:48.664 --> 00:29:51.051
I mean this I just, surprising.

00:29:51.252 --> 00:29:55.525
I mean are they becoming now out of date or something?

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:59.676
Christ has said 'First will be the last'.

00:29:59.877 --> 00:30:03.097
I hope that's not going to happen.

00:30:03.298 --> 00:30:04.807
Sort of a confidence they develop,

00:30:05.008 --> 00:30:06.636
'Oh, we are old Sahaja Yogis.'

00:30:06.837 --> 00:30:10.837
We have had a horrible results in London

00:30:11.525 --> 00:30:13.316
of this consciousness that 'We are old,

00:30:13.517 --> 00:30:15.066
we'll do whatever we like.

00:30:15.267 --> 00:30:19.329
We may attend the collective or not.' A kind of a ego.

00:30:21.658 --> 00:30:24.736
Please be careful.

00:30:24.937 --> 00:30:28.620
Christ has clearly said 'First will be the last.'

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.026
And I've seen so many of them, just getting out like that,

00:30:33.227 --> 00:30:36.555
even I don't know how they get out.

00:30:39.782 --> 00:30:45.016
In such stupid ways that unimaginable for anyone.

00:30:45.217 --> 00:30:50.774
Like one gentleman in Italy was an old Sahaja Yogi

00:30:50.975 --> 00:30:55.120
just got up and said: 'I am Maha Mataji.'

00:30:56.019 --> 00:31:00.154
Everyone started looking at him. 'What do you mean?'

00:31:00.355 --> 00:31:06.823
'I am Maha Mataji and I'm going to do all this myself.'

00:31:08.293 --> 00:31:11.770
So they said, 'Alright, so we are going out of ashram.'

00:31:11.973 --> 00:31:15.412
'No, no, no, I can't manage the ashram, I'm getting out.'

00:31:15.613 --> 00:31:18.257
And he went and stayed with someone, that lady,

00:31:18.461 --> 00:31:24.195
who heard against me and got cancer and died.

00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:33.922
In the collectivity supposing you have one problem,

00:31:34.123 --> 00:31:38.919
another one has some problem. It just works out, balances.

00:31:42.154 --> 00:31:48.041
As one finger is cut out, it is useless

00:31:48.242 --> 00:31:54.773
or a nail which is taken out is useless. It dies.

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:58.768
So that is how we are organizing

00:31:58.969 --> 00:32:02.664
our spiritual death and ultimately I don't know what else.

00:32:02.865 --> 00:32:04.370
And then they come back that

00:32:04.571 --> 00:32:06.758
'Mother I have got now these troubles so I have come back,

00:32:06.959 --> 00:32:10.498
I was out of Sahaja Yoga for three years.'

00:32:10.699 --> 00:32:12.279
I say: 'What do you mean, out of Sahaja Yoga?'

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:15.863
'I didn't attend any collective programme.'

00:32:19.543 --> 00:32:22.823
I am thinking of the collectivity of the whole world,

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:28.513
that's my vision, and if Sahaja Yogis cannot be collective

00:32:28.714 --> 00:32:32.458
who is going to be collective?

00:32:32.659 --> 00:32:36.065
Who is going to fulfill my vision?

00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.385
So all of you, those who call themselves Sahaja Yogis,

00:32:45.586 --> 00:32:48.242
must attend the programme.

00:32:49.906 --> 00:32:52.103
And the second thing is that

00:32:52.304 --> 00:33:00.304
there was a little problem of generosity of people.

00:33:01.093 --> 00:33:04.626
Of course that's also is a character of Mahalaxshmi,

00:33:04.846 --> 00:33:07.400
She's very generous.

00:33:07.737 --> 00:33:13.807
And when you are generous in giving vibrations

00:33:14.526 --> 00:33:18.957
and looking after people, this and that,

00:33:19.158 --> 00:33:22.306
then Mahalaxshmi's principle works out.

00:33:22.507 --> 00:33:24.759
But Mahalaxshmi doesn't give money to people

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:28.046
who are miserly, will never give.

00:33:29.234 --> 00:33:34.855
They may have money in the bank but they can never enjoy.

00:33:37.777 --> 00:33:42.959
So if there is need people have to give money to Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:47.519
I have been supplying lot of money, as you know, from the very beginning.

00:33:47.824 --> 00:33:49.326
Those who are early Sahaja Yogis will know

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:51.727
how much I have been able to pay.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:55.290
But now we are growing and everybody should know

00:33:55.491 --> 00:34:01.881
that we have to pay. After all this is our responsibility.

00:34:02.085 --> 00:34:05.691
Where are we going to spend our money, in what?

00:34:05.892 --> 00:34:08.235
I mean my family feels that, that what,

00:34:08.478 --> 00:34:11.915
whatever money I'm spending for Sahaja Yoga is the best.

00:34:12.111 --> 00:34:15.383
They get punyas, is the best for them.

00:34:15.584 --> 00:34:23.584
Only with punyas you get more wealth, health and prosperity.

00:34:23.865 --> 00:34:26.865
If you do not have punyas you cannot get it.

00:34:27.786 --> 00:34:32.043
It will come and go away.

00:34:32.244 --> 00:34:36.556
It will disappear, into thin air.

00:34:39.782 --> 00:34:43.719
So I was surprised that people are not generous.

00:34:47.172 --> 00:34:53.155
We have to know that we are so much better off people

00:34:53.356 --> 00:34:56.356
than many others.

00:34:57.426 --> 00:35:00.334
Like the Eastern Bloc people are not so good

00:35:00.535 --> 00:35:02.394
in money matters just now.

00:35:02.918 --> 00:35:06.905
I'm not saying that we have to help them but we have to think.

00:35:07.113 --> 00:35:09.534
Have we sent something for them as presents?

00:35:10.137 --> 00:35:12.137
Can we do something for them?

00:35:12.739 --> 00:35:17.332
The matter has the value which is again Mahakali's power.

00:35:17.533 --> 00:35:21.486
Is the power of Mahakali,

00:35:21.830 --> 00:35:27.942
that the matter carries the love.

00:35:28.143 --> 00:35:30.645
Expresses.

00:35:33.872 --> 00:35:38.615
So many times I have seen how, very sweetly,

00:35:38.816 --> 00:35:40.498
they gave me something.

00:35:40.699 --> 00:35:44.956
I really don't take anything and I don't need anything

00:35:45.157 --> 00:35:47.844
but certain things which show so such concern,

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:53.233
such understanding, such love.

00:35:54.100 --> 00:35:56.795
How will you express your love?

00:35:58.147 --> 00:36:01.420
To those people who're so far away.

00:36:04.678 --> 00:36:11.844
You just try, try to give, try to give for Sahaja Yoga also

00:36:12.045 --> 00:36:17.654
and you'll be amazed how it will work out.

00:36:18.701 --> 00:36:23.393
For collectivity we have to know that Shri Bhairavanath

00:36:23.594 --> 00:36:28.289
and Shri Hanumana and Shri Ganesha,

00:36:28.490 --> 00:36:33.335
these three principles that work within

00:36:33.536 --> 00:36:36.975
us, all of them have parallel work to do, parallel work,

00:36:37.176 --> 00:36:41.264
they do not interfere for each other. But if it comes to help

00:36:41.465 --> 00:36:47.627
they go all out, there's no quarrel.

00:36:47.827 --> 00:36:50.533
No quarrel between the two, no.

00:36:50.791 --> 00:36:53.252
If Hanuman needs Bhairava, he is there,

00:36:53.463 --> 00:36:57.603
if Bhairava needs Hanumana he is there, all out.

00:36:58.708 --> 00:37:05.666
So this collectivity comes only by understanding one thing

00:37:05.867 --> 00:37:08.609
what a great work we are doing today,

00:37:08.874 --> 00:37:13.225
people are not conscious of that, they take it just by the way.

00:37:13.663 --> 00:37:17.103
In the war you have seen how people fight,

00:37:17.304 --> 00:37:21.655
even if they have the fear of dying.

00:37:21.950 --> 00:37:25.450
Formerly nobody was paid also in the military.

00:37:27.114 --> 00:37:30.295
But they went and fought, maybe for their country,

00:37:30.496 --> 00:37:34.295
for anything. And they used to join together to fight,

00:37:34.496 --> 00:37:38.139
they allowed themselves to be killed, they helped each other,

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:41.608
they did this, all these qualities are there

00:37:41.809 --> 00:37:44.788
when we want to hate someone.

00:37:44.989 --> 00:37:47.653
But when we want to love someone why shouldn't we help,

00:37:47.865 --> 00:37:50.918
those qualities emerging out of us.

00:37:55.219 --> 00:37:59.682
These are the qualities of Mahakali

00:37:59.883 --> 00:38:04.037
because She is the expert of war affairs.

00:38:05.303 --> 00:38:08.022
She's the One who makes people work

00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:14.378
and She's the One who makes them fight because is the desire.

00:38:14.579 --> 00:38:20.821
They have nothing there, just the desire to do something

00:38:21.022 --> 00:38:27.985
and then they join together and then the Mahasaraswati helps them to act

00:38:28.186 --> 00:38:32.493
but first the desire is so strong.

00:38:32.693 --> 00:38:35.310
Now the desire has to be very very strong within us

00:38:35.511 --> 00:38:39.182
that we have to be for the emancipation of the whole world,

00:38:39.386 --> 00:38:41.737
we are the people, we are the special people,

00:38:41.917 --> 00:38:42.870
we are in the (foundation?).

00:38:43.152 --> 00:38:50.296
Nothing else is more important than our own personality

00:38:50.497 --> 00:38:55.030
 being completely dedicated for Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:56.699 --> 00:39:02.173
This desire has to be extremely strong and very pure.

00:39:03.584 --> 00:39:09.030
Those actually desire it, actually,

00:39:09.382 --> 00:39:11.538
they get their Realization like that,

00:39:11.741 --> 00:39:13.584
they reach their depth like that

00:39:13.785 --> 00:39:15.991
and they enjoy doing work of Sah...

00:39:16.192 --> 00:39:19.926
they all the time they enjoy it, for them nothing is more important.

00:39:25.403 --> 00:39:27.382
As we say in, there's a saying that

00:39:27.583 --> 00:39:31.161
when you get the re...water of Ganges to drink,

00:39:31.362 --> 00:39:36.651
why should you take water from dirty, er, rivers?

00:39:39.064 --> 00:39:41.718
So the whole attention is that side,

00:39:42.195 --> 00:39:45.931
the all the joy you get out of this romance and this love,

00:39:46.132 --> 00:39:51.332
and this and that, becomes zero before it because it's Nirananda.

00:39:51.592 --> 00:39:54.435
Only joy.

00:39:54.636 --> 00:39:57.753
In the marriage you see wife says like this, says that,

00:39:57.954 --> 00:40:04.537
er, all this is so conditioning. Any, any joy.

00:40:05.413 --> 00:40:07.962
You have different joys on different centers,

00:40:08.163 --> 00:40:10.290
they are all given by Mahakali,

00:40:10.491 --> 00:40:13.733
but the greatest of all you have got after Realization

00:40:14.022 --> 00:40:19.381
is the Nirananda, that state you must reach, to Nirananda state.

00:40:21.273 --> 00:40:24.085
If you are in that state of Nirananda,

00:40:24.286 --> 00:40:30.929
then all other these pleasures and joys are zero.

00:40:31.136 --> 00:40:32.713
I mean so many people who told me

00:40:32.914 --> 00:40:34.855
they were very fond of cricket in India,

00:40:35.056 --> 00:40:38.144
they said, 'Mother, we don't see nowadays cricket.' I said 'Why?'

00:40:38.345 --> 00:40:41.613
'The enjoyment is not there now, it's a sort of,

00:40:41.814 --> 00:40:45.371
that enjoyment is lost.'

00:40:45.572 --> 00:40:48.473
Otherwise Indians are mad after cricket.

00:40:48.674 --> 00:40:52.051
See even in the forest if you go they'll be listening to the cricket.

00:40:52.252 --> 00:40:56.059
It's a game played by English, who are not so much interested

00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.136
but Indians are. And now if you ask them

00:40:59.337 --> 00:41:03.110
they say 'No, we're not interested (now?).'

00:41:03.431 --> 00:41:06.449
So many people who used to read seven, eight newspapers say

00:41:06.650 --> 00:41:10.762
'We never read newspapers, never good news, finished.'

00:41:10.963 --> 00:41:14.590
And still they are managing because the whole focus

00:41:14.791 --> 00:41:18.871
of your attention is now on Sahaja Yoga

00:41:19.072 --> 00:41:21.238
because you only enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:21.439 --> 00:41:24.973
You like to meet Sahaja Yogis, you have to be with Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:25.174 --> 00:41:29.434
We had a puja in England,

00:41:29.635 --> 00:41:37.612
it was raining and quite a vibrant puja of Shri Ganesha.

00:41:37.813 --> 00:41:40.448
But nobody was bothered.

00:41:40.649 --> 00:41:45.057
It started pouring down through the, er, pendal they had put up,

00:41:45.258 --> 00:41:47.963
nobody was bothered. All right, water has come,

00:41:48.164 --> 00:41:51.283
let the water pass this way, we'll sit that side.

00:41:51.484 --> 00:41:57.299
Everybody had just, eh, because first thing was to enjoy.

00:41:57.500 --> 00:42:01.580
They didn't want to give up enjoyment at any cost.

00:42:01.781 --> 00:42:07.602
And it continued, the whole night. One was worried

00:42:07.803 --> 00:42:11.313
because somebody has threatened that the police will come.

00:42:11.514 --> 00:42:13.309
I made the police sleep also

00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:16.364
and the man who was to report also was sleeping.

00:42:16.565 --> 00:42:21.853
So the whole night we enjoyed ourselves.

00:42:22.854 --> 00:42:25.301
Now this enjoyment cannot come to you

00:42:25.502 --> 00:42:30.489
if you do not have purity of your mind.

00:42:30.690 --> 00:42:32.856
Nirananda.

00:42:33.057 --> 00:42:36.504
You can get other anands of other, other things.

00:42:36.705 --> 00:42:38.777
Other, other chakras.

00:42:38.978 --> 00:42:43.751
You are absolutely purified.

00:42:44.130 --> 00:42:48.229
But how to bring the purity.

00:42:49.025 --> 00:42:52.321
Just by developing thoughtless awareness

00:42:52.522 --> 00:42:56.850
and looking at things without thinking.

00:43:00.083 --> 00:43:04.561
For that you have to be collective. If you are collective,

00:43:04.762 --> 00:43:07.051
I am there, wherever you are collective,

00:43:07.340 --> 00:43:11.319
wherever you gather, I am there

00:43:11.520 --> 00:43:13.666
and nothing gives me greater pleasure

00:43:13.899 --> 00:43:18.118
to hear that all of you are attending this programme.

00:43:19.198 --> 00:43:22.038
You'll be amazed that in Australia we have so many

00:43:22.239 --> 00:43:32.348
centers in every, every city but they all attend

00:43:32.549 --> 00:43:38.095
the programmes of collectivity

00:43:38.296 --> 00:43:45.712
because they know collectivity is the ocean of nourishment.

00:43:48.178 --> 00:43:53.781
This is the simplest thing we have to do,

00:43:53.982 --> 00:43:57.986
but the bhoots are much more collective.

00:43:58.187 --> 00:44:03.538
Much more collective. Bhoots can go

00:44:03.739 --> 00:44:07.925
to such a length of fraternity

00:44:08.126 --> 00:44:12.032
that you'll be amazed.

00:44:15.903 --> 00:44:18.725
There was a lady in France only.

00:44:18.926 --> 00:44:23.062
She was an old lady and her daughter was in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:23.262 --> 00:44:27.053
She had become absolutely mad so she put her in the,

00:44:27.254 --> 00:44:28.508
I mean absolutely bhootish,

00:44:28.708 --> 00:44:31.694
and so she put her in a elderly home.

00:44:31.895 --> 00:44:36.514
And in the elderly home she only knew how to go to church on Sundays,

00:44:36.715 --> 00:44:38.419
she would dress up and go to church,

00:44:38.619 --> 00:44:41.541
that's only sensible thing she used to do.

00:44:43.254 --> 00:44:48.558
So she put her in the thing and there was a church,

00:44:48.767 --> 00:44:52.933
and she told me this, her daughter told me that it is very amazing

00:44:53.134 --> 00:44:56.080
that all of them get up in the morning,

00:44:56.280 --> 00:44:58.883
dress up well and go to church

00:44:59.084 --> 00:45:02.206
and in the, inside the church there are graves of people

00:45:02.407 --> 00:45:06.886
who have died, out of those, I mean,

00:45:07.086 --> 00:45:11.385
half-mad or full-mad elderly people.

00:45:11.586 --> 00:45:14.920
Otherwise they did not know even how to wear their dresses,

00:45:15.121 --> 00:45:18.913
they didn't know how to eat their food, they didn't know anything

00:45:19.114 --> 00:45:21.429
but when it came to going

00:45:21.630 --> 00:45:25.018
to church to that bhootish place where all the bhoots were there,

00:45:25.261 --> 00:45:28.448
they all would get up in the morning, dress up properly

00:45:28.643 --> 00:45:32.724
and go to the church, sit down, sing hymns and come back.

00:45:32.925 --> 00:45:36.019
As if like possessions.

00:45:36.220 --> 00:45:39.341
Such a fraternity of bhoots there is.

00:45:39.542 --> 00:45:41.598
As soon as one bhoot comes in,

00:45:41.799 --> 00:45:44.807
one bhoot came now recently from Australia.

00:45:45.025 --> 00:45:47.794
Now he is gathering all the bhoots round here.

00:45:47.995 --> 00:45:53.265
Even to Pune there he gathered, all the bhoots, immediately.

00:45:53.477 --> 00:45:57.299
Then he came here, now he's gathering those bhoots.

00:45:57.500 --> 00:45:59.151
People are getting friendly with him.

00:45:59.352 --> 00:46:02.461
Exactly who are bhoots you can make it out

00:46:02.662 --> 00:46:04.180
 by just seeing a bhoot sitting there

00:46:04.381 --> 00:46:06.997
and who is sitting next to that person.

00:46:07.193 --> 00:46:10.359
They are so attracted like a magnet,

00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:13.833
well the magnet is the quality of Mahakali.

00:46:18.607 --> 00:46:22.960
Bhoots know me better than anybody else can know

00:46:23.161 --> 00:46:27.090
because they know my past, they are in the past.

00:46:27.356 --> 00:46:30.554
And they know who has got bhoots

00:46:30.755 --> 00:46:32.864
and how they attract each other,

00:46:33.169 --> 00:46:37.160
and how they act on a bhootish person.

00:46:41.372 --> 00:46:45.271
That is why the positive collectivity has to be there.

00:46:46.678 --> 00:46:51.037
But when it comes to positivity they do not get collective.

00:46:52.139 --> 00:46:54.686
All those who do not get collective will gradually

00:46:54.887 --> 00:46:59.959
go into the fraternity of bhoots

00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.160
because today we are dealing about Mahakali.

00:47:03.398 --> 00:47:06.801
She is the One who knows everything about these bhootish things,

00:47:07.002 --> 00:47:09.588
she's in charge, I mean.

00:47:09.788 --> 00:47:13.164
She's the Lord of all these bhoots and She knows

00:47:13.365 --> 00:47:16.564
and She looks after then and She manages them.

00:47:16.846 --> 00:47:20.400
But where's, (inaudible word?) want to go into that realm,

00:47:20.666 --> 00:47:24.720
what has She to do?

00:47:24.921 --> 00:47:27.521
She has locked them up on one side

00:47:27.722 --> 00:47:29.846
but Sahaja Yogis want to go there,

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:33.745
just enter through back doors into that area,

00:47:33.946 --> 00:47:37.485
what can you do?

00:47:38.878 --> 00:47:42.251
Of course She protects, She doesn't want anyone to go there,

00:47:42.452 --> 00:47:45.089
She's just kept them out and told the bhoots

00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:50.284
not to come this side, but Sahaja Yogis only go there.

00:47:50.485 --> 00:47:53.978
That's been reported.

00:47:56.853 --> 00:48:02.206
Under these circumstances, Sahaja Yoga has gone very far,

00:48:02.407 --> 00:48:05.550
very much in so many other countries.

00:48:05.751 --> 00:48:08.063
In France you have seen yesterday

00:48:08.264 --> 00:48:14.394
how this ananda shakti of the Mother acted on people. '

00:48:14.594 --> 00:48:18.165
It was wonderful to see that, everybody came to me

00:48:18.366 --> 00:48:21.251
and they were full of smiles, I have never seen

00:48:21.452 --> 00:48:25.048
any French woman of that age smiling, never, no question,

00:48:25.249 --> 00:48:28.209
even if you tickled them, even if you certify that

00:48:28.421 --> 00:48:32.149
this is a joke they'll not smile like that.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:34.358
 I've never seen their teeth.

00:48:34.725 --> 00:48:38.786
Yesterday the whole face was lit up, so many of them,

00:48:38.987 --> 00:48:41.686
something so miraculous it was.

00:48:41.887 --> 00:48:49.256
This anandini shakti of Mahakali was acting so beautifully yesterday

00:48:49.457 --> 00:48:52.530
and you are the people who will now

00:48:52.730 --> 00:48:54.667
guide or misguide them.

00:48:55.747 --> 00:48:59.191
If you become, all of you become,

00:48:59.392 --> 00:49:01.451
higher personalities,

00:49:01.652 --> 00:49:04.260
if you become collective all of you,

00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:06.594
and if you become generous,

00:49:06.802 --> 00:49:10.674
and if you become absolutely pure, they will say

00:49:10.875 --> 00:49:15.252
'Now look at these people, how beautiful they look.'

00:49:15.463 --> 00:49:18.567
You already look very beautiful, your faces shine,

00:49:18.768 --> 00:49:22.768
but it will all disappear.

00:49:24.905 --> 00:49:33.718
And the effects of disappearance are not very simple.

00:49:33.918 --> 00:49:38.716
So be careful, I of course bless you,

00:49:38.917 --> 00:49:46.917
with all the qualities of Bhairava,

00:49:47.511 --> 00:49:51.775
as He is the greatest disciple of Mahakali

00:49:51.976 --> 00:49:54.181
and He is the One who is running up and down,

00:49:54.382 --> 00:49:56.913
morning till evening every time, specially in the night

00:49:57.179 --> 00:50:00.837
He is working so very hard killing these horrible rakshasas,

00:50:01.038 --> 00:50:04.866
this, that,

00:50:07.196 --> 00:50:12.008
and achieving such results.

00:50:12.208 --> 00:50:17.532
We have to join Him, all of us, and work it out.

00:50:17.783 --> 00:50:21.956
May God Bless You.
