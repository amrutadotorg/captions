00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:50.673
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna within us.

00:04:55.775 --> 00:05:04.666
As you know, that you all have been seeking
before coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:22.997
You went to different places, read lots of
books, and also some of you were lost.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.838
And in that seeking, perhaps you did not know
what you were seeking.

00:05:33.092 --> 00:05:39.217
What you were seeking was to know yourself.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:44.192
In all religions it is said “Know thyself.”

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:47.203
It’s a common thing all of them have said.

00:05:47.441 --> 00:05:54.171
This is one point which is absolutely there
in every religion, “Know thyself” –

00:05:54.338 --> 00:06:00.097
because without knowing yourself you will not know God.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:02.743
You will not know spirituality.

00:06:02.885 --> 00:06:07.100
So the first step was to know yourself,

00:06:07.393 --> 00:06:13.459
and that one people did all kinds of tricks with you,
they taught you in a different ways

00:06:13.666 --> 00:06:20.501
and tried to actually loot you and cheat you.

00:06:20.652 --> 00:06:23.567
All those things have happened, is finished.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:31.730
So then you come to Sahaja Yoga and you get
your Self-realization.

00:06:32.353 --> 00:06:44.941
Well, what is the purpose of Self-realization
is to know God, or the Goddess;

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:50.558
that is the purpose of Self-realization.

00:06:51.732 --> 00:06:59.016
But after getting Self-realization, what should
happen to you?

00:06:59.929 --> 00:07:07.613
Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical
things like drugs and all those things;

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:15.487
you have lost interest in reading also useless
books; you have lost interest

00:07:15.512 --> 00:07:19.079
in other habits like drinking and all that.

00:07:19.394 --> 00:07:23.509
But that’s not enough, that’s not enough.

00:07:23.509 --> 00:07:27.791
That would happen in anyway.

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:34.506
What has to happen by knowing God, is that
why does God wants you to know Him?

00:07:34.588 --> 00:07:39.738
Because He wants to see His reflection in you.

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:46.170
He wants to see His reflection, that’s why
He has created you, and He wants to see His

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:47.450
reflection in you.

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:49.239
Same with the Goddess.

00:07:49.239 --> 00:08:00.439
She has given you Self-realization because
She wants to see Her reflection in you.

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:18.289
So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection,
which is so much purer, beautiful, loving,

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:27.429
compassionate and above all, full of wisdom.

00:08:27.429 --> 00:08:35.239
So this is the point one has to reach, where
you understand you have to have wisdom.

00:08:35.239 --> 00:08:41.200
If you are lacking in wisdom then you are
not a self-realized person.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:50.510
At the level of Shri Krishna, you see, He
wants you to become one part and parcel of

00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:57.950
the Virata – or the Viratangana, also wants
the same thing, that you should become part

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:02.700
and parcel of the Virata.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:08.870
Not because you are realized souls now, so
you go about thinking you are perfectly all

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:13.320
right, you don’t have to do anything about
it.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:24.140
What do you do beyond this is the point, that
after Self-realization you have to see the

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:37.281
reflection that should be within you from
the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

00:09:37.281 --> 00:09:49.090
Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult
situation, as you know, and He was carried

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:55.420
from there to Gokul, where He was brought
up by Yeshoda.

00:09:55.420 --> 00:10:04.070
Now there He started His playfulness.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:11.650
So you have to be playful in life, you have
to create fun and joy.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:20.730
He didn’t say that you sit down like a old
sage somewhere in the Himalayas, but you mix

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:28.120
up with children, you talk to them, you play
with them, have fun.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:35.410
At the same time He was destroying negative
forces which acted upon Him.

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:40.870
In His playfulness only He has done it, as
a child only He has done it.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:47.960
How matured He was as a child you can see,
that He killed the Putana, and there are two

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:51.861
horrible rakshasas also, He killed them.

00:10:52.433 --> 00:10:57.283
At the same time He was playing with the gopis

00:10:57.347 --> 00:11:03.444
and teasing them, troubling them, making fun of them.

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.967
Why?

00:11:05.992 --> 00:11:16.962
Because He wanted them to be playful; and
all kinds of celebrations He arranged.

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:26.510
He had once a big rain came, and He lifted
the complete mountain on His fingertips.

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:32.680
That time these people should have understood,
it’s not possible, it’s a miracle.

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:42.820
But He was just standing there with the one
finger at the mountain in a very simple, unassuming

00:11:42.820 --> 00:11:51.080
manner; He was doing all that to protect all
the boys who were playing with Him.

00:11:51.080 --> 00:12:00.830
Then He went and killed Kaaliya, the one who
was a big snake in the water.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:08.840
In the water this horrible fellow was creating
venom, and by which many people were killed.

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:22.430
It took Him no time and He jumped inside that
horrible water of Yamuna, from where He rescued

00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:32.210
in a way all the people by killing or hitting,
or you can say that by winning over this Kaaliya.

00:12:32.210 --> 00:12:37.297
But the wives of the big serpent, they asked Him

00:12:37.322 --> 00:12:42.686
that “Please forgive him,” and He forgave.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:51.310
All these things show a child of six, seven
years doing all these great things without

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:58.190
feeling what He was doing, we can say that
without even thinking about it.

00:12:58.190 --> 00:13:05.030
But He achieved it, because He was aware that
He was Shri Krishna.

00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:11.060
So first thing, you have to be aware that
you are self-realized people.

00:13:11.060 --> 00:13:20.799
You are not ordinary people to behave in an
ordinary way, you are special people made

00:13:20.799 --> 00:13:27.780
specially to reflect the qualities of God
Almighty.

00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:33.729
It’s not expected that you go and kill Kaaliya.

00:13:33.729 --> 00:13:41.430
But the situation is such today that you are
all the time protected.

00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:44.539
You are all the time protected.

00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:49.570
No one can harm you, no one can kill you,

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:56.899
and you can be looked after
because you are Sahaja yogis.

00:14:00.359 --> 00:14:04.708
Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja yogi

00:14:04.882 --> 00:14:09.255
towards taking decisions, one should understand.

00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:18.189
It should be a spontaneous decision.

00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:23.900
You don’t have to tally it with this, go
there and find out – immediately, spontaneous,

00:14:23.900 --> 00:14:31.270
like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river.

00:14:31.270 --> 00:14:37.540
So in the same way you should have a very
spontaneous decision for anything.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:39.739
Now you want to buy, say, a carpet.

00:14:39.739 --> 00:14:40.739
All right.

00:14:40.739 --> 00:14:46.999
You go in the shop and immediately you should
know which is the one.

00:14:46.999 --> 00:14:54.239
In every walk of life you should have a very
spontaneous decision, instant decision.

00:14:54.239 --> 00:14:59.700
But what I find, the style is very different.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:07.739
They’ll go from shop to shop, then make
a list of it, then make all the measurements,

00:15:07.739 --> 00:15:13.119
then go home and say that “We’ll decide
it tomorrow.”

00:15:13.119 --> 00:15:18.020
That’s not the way a Sahaja yogi behaves.

00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:25.405
Sahaja yogi has to decide everything absolutely
spontaneously, at that moment.

00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:33.096
You should be like this: now somebody is getting drowned,

00:15:33.193 --> 00:15:37.964
so the first impulse should be that you have to save.

00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:42.040
And how do you save?

00:15:43.593 --> 00:15:48.979
You jump in the water – because you are
protected, nothing can happen to you,

00:15:49.094 --> 00:15:53.323
so just jump in the water and you’ll save the person.

00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:59.739
Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude,
this should be your temperament, that you

00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:03.900
take a very spontaneous decision.

00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:14.929
All this thinking and all kinds of decision-making,
and having a big conference for decisions

00:16:14.929 --> 00:16:19.109
and all that – not needed.

00:16:19.109 --> 00:16:28.239
In day-to-day life also you have to be like
that.

00:16:28.239 --> 00:16:36.559
Also in every political life, economic life
or any other life you have to lead, you have

00:16:36.559 --> 00:16:41.960
to be very spontaneous.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:46.380
How do you become spontaneous?

00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:47.380
What quality you have got?

00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:55.229
What is the weapon you have got, to know what
decision to take?

00:16:55.229 --> 00:16:58.339
Do you know?

00:16:58.339 --> 00:17:04.299
You have got vibrations, you have the feel of the vibrations,

00:17:04.513 --> 00:17:08.210
and you know what vibrations are.

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:13.729
You know what vibrations tell you, and convey
and communicate to you.

00:17:13.729 --> 00:17:16.169
They speak to you.

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:25.299
So through your vibrations you should know
in a second what should you do.

00:17:25.299 --> 00:17:31.140
For example now, somebody told Me that “Mother,
when I came to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations.”

00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:33.130
It’s a fact.

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:38.210
But how many of you feel that way?

00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:43.150
Because your sensitivity is not yet developed.

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.739
You have to be sensitive about your vibrations.

00:17:47.739 --> 00:17:55.289
You should know looking at anyone, sitting
next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone,

00:17:55.289 --> 00:18:03.090
you should know what sort of vibrations that
person has.

00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.010
This kind of sensitivity if you develop,

00:18:06.097 --> 00:18:10.200
then you will definitely take a very spontaneous decision.

00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:14.689
You know I am very good at it.

00:18:14.689 --> 00:18:22.439
I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really
five minutes.

00:18:22.439 --> 00:18:28.049
When I came here they said, “You can’t
go up, because You have big car.”

00:18:28.049 --> 00:18:31.840
So the Mayor said, “All right, come along,
I’ll take You in my car.”

00:18:31.840 --> 00:18:36.770
So I went with him on the car, on that car,
and I saw it.

00:18:36.770 --> 00:18:39.219
It was all dilapidated, no doubt.

00:18:39.219 --> 00:18:49.549
It was all absolutely in a shambles, all right,
and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt.

00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:54.710
And everybody who was with Me, they said,
“Ah, what a place, Mother!

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:57.290
You can’t buy that.”

00:18:57.290 --> 00:19:00.149
So I told the Mayor, “I am buying it.”

00:19:00.149 --> 00:19:01.200
“When?”

00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.249
“Today.

00:19:02.249 --> 00:19:03.299
Now!”

00:19:03.299 --> 00:19:04.299
He was amazed.

00:19:04.299 --> 00:19:07.929
I said, “You tell Me, how do I buy?”

00:19:07.929 --> 00:19:09.729
He said, “Very easy.

00:19:09.729 --> 00:19:17.649
In this Italy You have to buy like this, that
You pay one-third of the price, all right?

00:19:17.649 --> 00:19:19.939
And then You can occupy.

00:19:19.939 --> 00:19:25.790
If You find something wrong with the place
You can give up, but then You’ll not get

00:19:25.790 --> 00:19:26.790
Your money.

00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:30.999
But if the other fellow who is selling You
says no, then he has to pay double.”

00:19:30.999 --> 00:19:33.149
I said, “Very good bargain.

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:34.149
I am buying.

00:19:34.149 --> 00:19:35.489
I have told you I am buying.

00:19:35.489 --> 00:19:37.570
I’ll buy.”

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:41.849
And everybody was surprised what Mother was
doing.

00:19:41.849 --> 00:19:46.470
So what decided was the vibrations.

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.760
Vibrations of the place just decided.

00:19:48.760 --> 00:19:50.049
I said, “Buy it.”

00:19:50.049 --> 00:19:56.119
That way they took Me to seven, I think, castles;
I said no.

00:19:56.119 --> 00:20:01.670
Outside only I could say no, and they were
surprised I didn’t even go inside.

00:20:01.670 --> 00:20:04.599
I said, “Ask them what was here.”

00:20:04.599 --> 00:20:06.869
They said, “Nunnery.”

00:20:06.869 --> 00:20:09.140
I said, “See?”

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.409
Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous
decision.

00:20:13.409 --> 00:20:25.890
Then you will be amazed how in such a short
time you can really achieve such great things.

00:20:29.080 --> 00:20:33.575
But that doesn’t mean that you all should do that way;

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:37.760
first you should have that sensitivity of vibrations.

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.553
If you have that sensitivity of vibrations,

00:20:40.585 --> 00:20:44.651
then I would say you are now matured in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:44.723 --> 00:20:47.972
So the maturity has to be brought in.

00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:54.470
You cannot just say, “Now it’s all right,
I have got Self-realization, I can do this.”

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:59.570
First you tally your sense of sensitivity.

00:20:59.570 --> 00:21:04.709
So now, how do you know?

00:21:04.709 --> 00:21:13.479
For example, you take a spontaneous decision,
you find that you have got nothing, it’s

00:21:13.479 --> 00:21:16.439
all nonsense – possible.

00:21:16.439 --> 00:21:24.159
But you can see for yourself that your decisions,
if they are spontaneous: if they fail, if

00:21:24.159 --> 00:21:35.510
they are wrong, if there are some mistakes
or that will make you suffer, whether economically,

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:45.120
politically, in every way, then your whole
value system will be judged very well how

00:21:45.120 --> 00:21:57.330
far you have gone into Sahaja Yoga, how far
you have achieved your Self-realization, and

00:21:57.330 --> 00:22:03.520
where are you.

00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:06.240
This is what is the way to test yourself.

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:15.090
You should not be afraid of failures, and
not get enamored by success, because you are

00:22:15.090 --> 00:22:16.620
self-realized souls.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:24.020
Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately
you will know what is it.

00:22:24.916 --> 00:22:27.877
Now of course, I wouldn’t say that

00:22:27.908 --> 00:22:31.770
you could have the same as I have, but you should try it.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:39.610
Now, I have seen some people will praise some
man, “Oh Mother, he’s so good.

00:22:39.610 --> 00:22:41.260
You must meet him.

00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:48.860
He’s such a nice person and he’s of such
a help, and this will happen and that will

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:49.860
happen.”

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.140
I said, “All right, you show Me a photograph.”

00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:57.910
I said, “I am sorry, I don’t want to meet
him.”

00:22:57.910 --> 00:23:00.730
They can’t understand.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:04.430
“Such a great man, he’ll be a minister
tomorrow.”

00:23:04.430 --> 00:23:09.480
“I don’t want to meet him.”

00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:15.790
And you find immediately, just next day, a
big report about him in the newspaper that

00:23:15.790 --> 00:23:20.820
he’s a very bad man.

00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:30.760
So you must tally your experience and your
understanding of what you have decided spontaneously.

00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:36.000
But still I would say, keep to spontaneous
decisions.

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:43.560
Don’t think about it how it should work
out, what should we do.

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:57.580
It has a very far-fetched influence on your
mind also that you see, that you know what

00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.290
is right and what is wrong.

00:24:00.290 --> 00:24:03.930
I don’t know how many of you have seen the
house I have built.

00:24:03.930 --> 00:24:12.610
The another side of Shri Krishna was that
He was extremely creative.

00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:20.120
In His childhood He did all these things,
these pranks, and when He became a grown-up

00:24:20.120 --> 00:24:25.740
person He became the king of Dwarika, of that
area.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:31.040
And He used to dress up like a king only – after
all, He was a king.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:41.520
When He was a child He used to wear a small
little piece of a feather from the peacock,

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:47.760
but when He became the king He was wearing
all the things, and He used to sit on the

00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.680
throne and talk to people in that manner.

00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:59.400
All that greatness was there, and He was extremely
creative.

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:09.420
He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful
castle or you can say, palace in Dwarika,

00:25:09.420 --> 00:25:13.460
out of gold – can you believe it?

00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.080
Shri Krishna did it.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:19.170
And it was all then covered with water.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:25.470
Now the intellectuals in India, all trained
by Western people I think, said that it’s

00:25:25.470 --> 00:25:32.740
not possible, there’s nothing in the water
and He never built His palace there; it’s

00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:40.320
all a story just, just like a myth.

00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.530
But some people believed in it, and they dug
up.

00:25:44.530 --> 00:25:49.370
They went down and they found there was a
very big palace.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.510
There was gold little bit left, but not all
of it was there.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:26:00.950
And they were amazed, such a huge, big palace
He had made.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:06.440
Under the water it had gone, but it was there.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:14.340
Like this, all these incarnations who came
were extremely creative.

00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:19.060
If you are not creative, what’s the use
of Self-realization?

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:25.180
Now, what is the greatest creative thing you
can do very easily is

00:26:25.405 --> 00:26:29.378
to make others Sahaja yogis.

00:26:30.050 --> 00:26:42.240
That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing,
is to make others Sahaja yogis and give them

00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:50.930
the blessings of the Divine, which they have
been seeking for ages.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:58.270
By giving them, you don’t know what a solace,
what a blessing you give.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:05.841
So now when you have got your Self-realization
– you got it very easily, I must say; they

00:27:05.841 --> 00:27:16.110
all say that it is a instant nirvana, Sahaja
Yoga is instant nirvana, it’s true – but

00:27:16.110 --> 00:27:23.570
whatever you get so easily and instantly,
you don’t understand the value of that.

00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:29.280
They always say for India that they got their
freedom so easily; they didn’t get it that

00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.780
easily, that’s why they do not value it.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:43.590
But it is true, if you get anything free firstly
and without any special effort, then you don’t

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:45.650
value it, you don’t understand.

00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:47.170
You think it’s a matter of right.

00:27:47.170 --> 00:27:51.720
But do you know how much people have suffered
for getting Self-realization?

00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:59.680
They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on
one leg, sometimes on their heads for months

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:05.170
together, and they didn’t get realization.

00:28:05.170 --> 00:28:14.760
I have heard of some people who lived in a
room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realization.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:19.090
And why they lived like that?

00:28:19.090 --> 00:28:25.800
Because they thought by keeping away from
other people, other bad atmosphere, everything,

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:27.520
they might get realization.

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.840
They never got it.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.847
So one must understand, though you have got
it very easily,

00:28:35.872 --> 00:28:42.800
it’s something so precious, so great.

00:28:42.930 --> 00:28:48.300
It’s not very easy to get Self-realization.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:58.430
You read about the people who are self-realized.

00:28:58.430 --> 00:29:03.310
Perhaps they did not even know how they got
it, they did not know even about the kundalini,

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:09.770
but they got it, through their guru maybe,
maybe their efforts.

00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:18.150
Buddha, how much He had to suffer till He
gets His realization – think of Him, how

00:29:18.150 --> 00:29:20.750
He got His realization.

00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:30.820
I mean, you shudder to see of His life: ultimately
dies of hunger and poverty.

00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:33.970
But nothing happened to you.

00:29:33.970 --> 00:29:41.370
You have got it without any difficulties,
in a very sweet manner, all of you.

00:29:41.370 --> 00:29:45.450
Nothing – you don’t have to pay, you don’t
have to do anything about it.

00:29:45.450 --> 00:29:53.080
But that doesn’t mean you should not value
it.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:30:05.610
Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth
spontaneously sprouts and gives life to the

00:30:05.610 --> 00:30:15.130
primule which grows, can grow into a shrub
and then into a tree.

00:30:15.130 --> 00:30:24.440
But you have to put water in, and you have
to have the care of a gardener or someone.

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:31.420
In your case, you are the one who has to do
all that.

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:41.510
First of all you have to put the nourishment
of compassion and love.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:44.630
Have you got that compassion and love?

00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:48.750
Do you love people?

00:30:48.750 --> 00:30:52.850
Like somebody told Me today – I was shocked
– “I don’t like children.”

00:30:52.850 --> 00:30:54.770
I said, “You don’t like children?”

00:30:54.770 --> 00:30:56.920
“No, I like others’ children, not mine.”

00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:05.550
Just imagine, how can you be doing that?

00:31:05.550 --> 00:31:10.640
How can you say such a thing, you don’t
like your own children, anything?

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:18.500
First of all, for all of you I would say that
you should never say “I like” and “I

00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:19.640
don’t like.”

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:21.340
These are anti-mantras.

00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.750
“I like this” – it’s very common.

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:26.450
Who are you?

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:28.730
“I don’t like this carpet.

00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:30.700
I don’t like that silver thing.”

00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:33.810
Who are you?

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:36.800
Can you make one like that?

00:31:38.411 --> 00:31:41.896
To take a decision of that kind is also shows

00:31:41.934 --> 00:31:46.085
they think it’s very spontaneous – it’s not.

00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:50.852
It has come from your conditioning, that you
think you have a right to say “I don’t

00:31:50.992 --> 00:31:53.060
like, I don’t want.”

00:31:53.060 --> 00:31:57.060
But who are you?

00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:04.090
If you are the spirit you’ll never use these
words, because it might hurt somebody.

00:32:04.090 --> 00:32:12.800
You’ll never say something that will hurt
others, you’ll never do anything that will

00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:20.970
be dangerous for others; but always you’ll
say something that would be extremely loving

00:32:20.970 --> 00:32:23.170
and compassionate, and peace-giving.

00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:30.770
You will emit joy for others.

00:32:30.770 --> 00:32:39.190
There is the power of spirit, that it gives
joy to others.

00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:44.870
If you are a glum person, grumpy person, then
you are not self-realized.

00:32:44.870 --> 00:32:51.004
You should be able to give joy and love and compassion,

00:32:51.115 --> 00:32:57.305
and it should happen absolutely spontaneously.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:11.120
There’s a story about a saint in India,
in Maharashtra.

00:33:11.120 --> 00:33:20.450
So they all used to take water in a container
called as kanwar, and would take it all the

00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:25.780
way to Gujarat, to a temple of Shri Krishna.

00:33:25.780 --> 00:33:33.120
That was regarded as a great, you can say,
surrendering to Shri Krishna.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:38.730
So that saint also carried water in that container,
this kanwar.

00:33:38.730 --> 00:33:49.810
All the way he carried it from his village
in Maharashtra, and when he reached the temple,

00:33:49.810 --> 00:34:03.660
at the foot of that temple he saw a donkey
very thirsty, dying out of thirst.

00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:10.430
So he gave that water to that donkey.

00:34:10.430 --> 00:34:14.620
Everybody said, “Imagine, you brought this
water for miles together, for days together

00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:22.890
to be put on the deity here, and now you have
given it to this donkey.”

00:34:22.890 --> 00:34:32.030
He said, “You don’t know, God has come
all the way down here to take the water.”

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:37.510
See the attitude that he took.

00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:46.780
So for a self-realized person the compassion
should be like that, of very generous nature.

00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:54.080
If you are not generous, if you are miserly,
always worried about your money and saving

00:34:54.080 --> 00:35:02.860
of it, then firstly you are not a matured
Sahaja yogi – you are not.

00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:09.280
Apart from that, this kind of money will never
give you any happiness.

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.920
Miserliness is against spirit.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:18.920
Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous.

00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:33.070
It never strives to save something, or cheat
people or steal something – is out of question;

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:39.110
because there is no greed left in it, there
is no greed at all.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:46.760
And that is why such a person who is a realized
soul cannot be greedy,

00:35:46.989 --> 00:35:49.915
has to be extremely generous.

00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:59.020
I have seen many people like that who have
been extremely generous, and who have been

00:35:59.020 --> 00:36:03.680
very understanding about the problems of others.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:09.870
While a Sahaja yogi will have his own problems,
he is not a Sahaja yogi at all.

00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:18.540
He is there to solve the problems of others,
and not to solve his own problems and go about

00:36:18.540 --> 00:36:20.820
talking about it, “This is the problem I
have.”

00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.310
Now this is a new word that has developed
in modern times.

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:29.880
They never used to use the word “problem”
before, I tell you; only for geometry we used

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:31.580
this word “problem.”

00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.670
But now it has started with a … “There’s
no problem.”

00:36:34.670 --> 00:36:41.660
They are all in a problem, actually they are
problems, I think.

00:36:41.660 --> 00:36:48.490
So what you have to do is to understand that
you should not give your problems to others.

00:36:48.490 --> 00:36:55.410
You should not ask for anything, “Please
do this for me, please do that for me.”

00:36:55.410 --> 00:37:07.930
It’s very surprising that people try to
sort of take advantage of others.

00:37:07.930 --> 00:37:13.030
Now some people like to visit some countries,
so they will ask you, “Please call me.

00:37:13.030 --> 00:37:15.791
I would love to come to your country,”

00:37:15.863 --> 00:37:19.485
and a generous Sahaja yogi will say, “All right, come along.”

00:37:20.863 --> 00:37:25.450
Now, who is failing here is the person who
asked.

00:37:25.450 --> 00:37:33.440
You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever,
because you are complete.

00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:35.969
Not that only you are satisfied, but are complete.

00:37:35.969 --> 00:37:42.380
What can anybody give you?

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:46.719
All desires just disappear when you are in
complete shape.

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:50.310
Like today I was coming, I saw lots of stars
had come out.

00:37:50.310 --> 00:37:55.130
I said, “As soon as the moon will come,
they’ll all disappear.”

00:37:55.130 --> 00:38:08.850
In the same way, when you are complete, you
do not expect anybody to do anything for you.

00:38:08.850 --> 00:38:14.540
On the contrary, you want to find out what
you can do for others.

00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:18.008
You become the others, in a way that whatever

00:38:18.034 --> 00:38:21.354
is the problem of others you take upon yourhead.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:26.360
You jump into it.

00:38:26.360 --> 00:38:34.530
It’s a very, very interesting growth that
should come in you.

00:38:34.530 --> 00:38:43.410
It should happen to all of you, because you
have got your Self-realization.

00:38:43.410 --> 00:38:50.940
You develop a kind of a personality which
only lives for others, not for oneself.

00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.840
You will be amazed: you can live anywhere,
you can sleep anywhere.

00:38:55.840 --> 00:39:00.000
You can have food, you need not have food,
whatever type of food you get it’s all right,

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.610
because you are so satisfied.

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:14.620
On the contrary, you’d like to cook for
others, give them food, do whatever you like

00:39:14.620 --> 00:39:17.540
possible, you try to do.

00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:25.940
As long as you can work it out, you do it.

00:39:25.940 --> 00:39:31.790
But there are people who have only their own
problems.

00:39:31.790 --> 00:39:33.870
They are not Sahaja yogis.

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:41.800
How can the spirit have problems?

00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:46.000
How can that happen?

00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:55.350
So just understand that you are now the spirit,
and beyond everything.

00:39:55.350 --> 00:40:01.690
So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:06.350
Of course you start giving realization to
people.

00:40:06.350 --> 00:40:08.870
You create art.

00:40:08.870 --> 00:40:14.655
You know Baba Mama, he was very bad at literature and he was – well,

00:40:14.710 --> 00:40:16.746
he didn’t know any language.

00:40:16.786 --> 00:40:21.646
He was very good for mathematics, because
My mother was a mathematician, but language

00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:23.430
he did not know.

00:40:23.430 --> 00:40:26.081
I used to write his essays, he was so bad!

00:40:26.081 --> 00:40:31.690
But after realization he wrote such beautiful
poems.

00:40:31.690 --> 00:40:33.470
Unbelievable!

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:38.690
Nobody can believe this Baba could do that,
because he didn’t know any language well.

00:40:38.690 --> 00:40:43.200
I used to write his essays, as I told you.

00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:52.640
So, amazingly, from where he started writing
Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry?

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:58.050
And one of My brothers asked him, “How do
you get this Urdu poetry?”

00:40:58.050 --> 00:41:01.769
He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me.”

00:41:01.769 --> 00:41:05.690
Everything he used to say, “Mataji tells
me.”

00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:16.072
So the creativity within you is just flowers,
and you are amazed at yourself

00:41:16.097 --> 00:41:18.880
how this creativity has come in.

00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:30.430
Now imagine, for a person who is a mathematician
becoming suddenly a poet – I mean, it’s

00:41:30.430 --> 00:41:32.980
impossible situation.

00:41:32.980 --> 00:41:34.700
And you have these capacities.

00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:40.882
You have all these capacities that you can
become very creative,

00:41:40.907 --> 00:41:46.130
and you have to be creative in every way.

00:41:46.130 --> 00:41:52.645
I am very creative, I must say, I am all the
time working out something

00:41:52.914 --> 00:41:55.961
which comes out very well.

00:41:56.510 --> 00:42:04.120
And also I don’t have that interest as normally
people have, that it should be praised by

00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:12.340
everyone or it should be, sort of, very much
in the newspapers and everything.

00:42:12.340 --> 00:42:14.990
No, no interest.

00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:22.340
You create for creation, for the sake of creation
you create, and you just enjoy that creation.

00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:34.000
And you become very adaptable, or you become
so congenial with all the things people say,

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.340
talk – all right, let them do it.

00:42:39.340 --> 00:42:47.062
They will be offensive, or they could be also
praising you … you don’t know that they

00:42:47.873 --> 00:42:49.703
are praising you.

00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.890
Even sometimes when you “Shri Mataji ki
Jai!”

00:42:53.890 --> 00:43:03.010
– I also say, and then I forget they are
talking about Me.

00:43:03.010 --> 00:43:10.570
Somehow you are above all that, and you are
there, and you just don’t understand why

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:17.470
human beings behave like that, why their behavior
is so funny.

00:43:17.470 --> 00:43:24.450
Even when they come to Sahaja Yoga I see they
have a great desire to be leaders, or they

00:43:24.450 --> 00:43:34.007
have a great desire to be a great organizer
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:34.032 --> 00:43:36.774
to be very well-known in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:36.822 --> 00:43:46.672
They want to have an international fame as
a great Sahaja yogi.

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:52.650
But they do not think that “What creativity
I have shown?

00:43:52.650 --> 00:43:56.550
What have I created?”

00:43:56.550 --> 00:44:02.710
Just all these things are so common in human
beings that they always want others to praise

00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:14.490
them, to have a very big sort of a exposure
– of what?

00:44:14.490 --> 00:44:17.870
If you are a spirit, everybody knows.

00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:25.300
What is there to expose, what is there to
show off, what is there to come forward?

00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:33.565
Even if you are at the back there is light,
you know there is light.

00:44:33.565 --> 00:44:41.690
So you have to get out of your darkness, because
you are the light and you spread light; instead

00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:49.429
of if you are in the darkness, what light
can you spread?

00:44:49.429 --> 00:44:53.710
So your spirit cannot have problems.

00:44:53.710 --> 00:44:58.350
It has no fear.

00:44:58.350 --> 00:45:08.230
But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom,
and that wisdom is the one sign of you being

00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:10.820
a very higher personality.

00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:19.730
As I told you, this is evolution, and when
you are transformed you are evolved.

00:45:19.730 --> 00:45:28.490
Of a very different nature you become, and
you are to stand out.

00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:36.610
If Sahaja yogis are like other people, then
what’s the use of taking to Sahaja Yoga?

00:45:36.610 --> 00:45:38.050
What was Christ?

00:45:38.050 --> 00:45:41.010
He was a son of a carpenter.

00:45:41.010 --> 00:45:46.700
He never got education.

00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:49.550
But what did He do?

00:45:49.550 --> 00:45:55.140
He was the Spirit.

00:45:55.140 --> 00:46:07.590
He reflected God within Him, and that’s
why He got Himself crucified also.

00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:15.190
Now in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to get
crucified, there are all not such testing

00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:22.290
things for you, but your value system is to
be checked.

00:46:22.290 --> 00:46:29.210
You must find out how are you working out,
through introspection.

00:46:29.210 --> 00:46:40.460
You should ask yourself, “So well now, Mr.
Sahaja yogi, how are you?

00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:45.182
Are you indulging into all these things that
these people

00:46:45.207 --> 00:46:49.253
who are not self-realized are doing?”

00:46:49.611 --> 00:46:58.371
Just try to find out, because the growth of
Sahaja Yoga is shown in your behavior, in

00:46:58.490 --> 00:47:05.450
your styles, on your face.

00:47:05.450 --> 00:47:16.280
There is no wrinkles on a person like this,
he has no worry; you don’t worry, then how

00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.740
will you get wrinkles?

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:23.450
Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything.

00:47:23.450 --> 00:47:29.940
I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things.

00:47:29.940 --> 00:47:41.611
Once in a church there was in Switzerland,
one lady came to hit Me with a Bible, and

00:47:41.611 --> 00:47:42.630
I started laughing.

00:47:42.630 --> 00:47:47.640
I said, “What a thing, and I have to be
hit by a Bible!” you see.

00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:54.380
And she got such a fright that I was laughing,
and I was saying, “Look at this stupidity

00:47:54.380 --> 00:47:56.860
of this lady, coming to hit Me with a Bible!”

00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:02.940
I mean, I can understand stone or anything
else, but Bible will never hit Me.

00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:19.180
All these things have happened in your presence,
and you know about it.

00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:24.210
There are negative forces.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:25.730
They try to harm you.

00:48:25.730 --> 00:48:31.070
They will harm you bodily, they will harm
you mentally, they might harm you emotionally.

00:48:31.070 --> 00:48:39.310
But when you are above this, then no one harms
you.

00:48:39.310 --> 00:48:44.990
At least you never feel the harm, you are
not bothered about the harm.

00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:48.340
But what have you created?

00:48:48.340 --> 00:48:55.310
Today I had some ladies and some men, and
all for divorce.

00:48:55.310 --> 00:49:01.980
After getting married in Sahaja Yoga, they
want to have divorces, can you imagine?

00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:04.890
I was shocked.

00:49:04.890 --> 00:49:08.880
And they had funny ideas that “my husband
is like my brother.”

00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:11.490
I said, “Really?”

00:49:11.490 --> 00:49:17.130
All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their
heads means there’s no light of the spirit

00:49:17.130 --> 00:49:18.390
in them.

00:49:18.390 --> 00:49:27.090
If you have light of the spirit, then your
understanding is very different.

00:49:27.090 --> 00:49:33.470
You don’t worry about yourself, you only
worry about others, and you try to find out

00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:37.150
solutions for them.

00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:40.260
You try to help them.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:47.410
It is very easy for you.

00:49:47.410 --> 00:49:50.420
What is so easy for the light to burn?

00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.890
Once it is enlightened, it is burning.

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:57.150
It’s difficult for it to go out of light.

00:49:57.150 --> 00:50:04.140
But for human beings, I can’t understand,
even after realization, after growing for

00:50:04.140 --> 00:50:11.860
years together they are still so stupid that
they don’t realize the value of their Self-realization.

00:50:11.860 --> 00:50:24.710
It is something, the spirit, you cannot kill
it.

00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:26.250
It cannot blow off.

00:50:26.250 --> 00:50:32.410
This light will go off, but the light of the
spirit won’t go off.

00:50:32.410 --> 00:50:41.970
But what is the oil that keeps it there is
your compassion, is love, care of others.

00:50:41.970 --> 00:50:47.410
I know there are people who are very, say,
dominating, may be troublesome, what else

00:50:47.410 --> 00:50:49.320
– but care for them.

00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:55.220
Know that they are not like you, they are
not complete, they have problems; so you care

00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:56.380
for them.

00:50:56.380 --> 00:51:00.610
But instead of that, you start thinking that
“Why should I care for him?

00:51:00.610 --> 00:51:01.710
How does he care for me?” or something.

00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:04.570
Then you are finished.

00:51:04.570 --> 00:51:13.920
So this kind of a reflection, or I would say
the reaction, is not that of a spirit.

00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:18.840
A spiritual person’s reactions are very,
very different.

00:51:18.840 --> 00:51:27.529
In the life of Shri Krishna you can see that
He had a friend who was very poor, and he

00:51:27.529 --> 00:51:31.120
wanted to meet Shri Krishna.

00:51:31.120 --> 00:51:38.140
And the wife of the friend gave him some rice
crispies, as you call them, “And that’s,

00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:40.230
take for your friend.

00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:41.940
You must take something for your friend.”

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:45.670
He was a little shy, you know.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:53.500
And when he went to Shri Krishna, Shri Krishna
was in His palace, and the people at the door

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:55.370
said, “No, you can’t meet Him.”

00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:57.050
He said, “All right.

00:51:57.050 --> 00:52:01.730
You just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.”

00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:08.960
He was sitting on the throne discussing something,
and He said, “Sudama has come!”

00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:23.009
He rushed out and went to the door and hugged
him, hugged him again and again; and He said,

00:52:23.009 --> 00:52:27.040
“Why are you standing here?”

00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:37.770
He took him and put him on the throne that
He was supposed to, and He told His wives,

00:52:37.770 --> 00:52:41.259
“Please come and wash his feet.”

00:52:41.259 --> 00:52:44.360
And then they brought for him clothes and
all that.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:54.430
He had a bath; He made him sleep on His bed
– see the love of Shri Krishna.

00:52:54.430 --> 00:52:59.180
He had very dirty feet, all were cracked.

00:52:59.180 --> 00:53:07.220
He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine
by which it would be all right.

00:53:07.220 --> 00:53:13.120
He tried to do whatever was possible to him
to cure those cracks.

00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:21.830
And He asked him to sleep on His bed, and
asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t

00:53:21.830 --> 00:53:24.170
feel hot.

00:53:24.170 --> 00:53:32.120
See the compassion of Shri Krishna, it shows
so beautifully.

00:53:32.120 --> 00:53:35.680
Are we that compassionate?

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:44.910
There was no need for Him to do that; it was
no drama, nothing – but His heart!

00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:49.400
He took a spontaneous decision.

00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:53.860
When He heard Sudama is there, He just rushed
there.

00:53:53.860 --> 00:54:03.600
He just felt so happy that “My old friend
has come.”

00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:19.680
Then, when He went to Hastinapur, there the
Duryodhan, the Kauravas’ eldest son, he

00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:22.950
asked Him that “Why don’t You come and
stay in my palace?”

00:54:22.950 --> 00:54:32.519
He said, “All right, I can come, but you
see, I will go and have food with Vidur.”

00:54:32.519 --> 00:54:37.190
Vidur was a son of a maid.

00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:44.120
He went and had His food with Vidur.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:53.190
Now Vidur being a poor man, I don’t know
what food he must have given Him, while Duryodhan

00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:56.930
would have given Him such sumptuous food.

00:54:56.930 --> 00:55:00.840
So for such people, taste and the level of
food and all doesn’t matter; it’s the

00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:11.910
love, the respect of Vidur, who was a realized
soul – respecting other Sahaja yogis.

00:55:11.910 --> 00:55:24.050
If a Sahaja yogi respects somebody who is
a governor – I can’t understand; the spirit

00:55:24.050 --> 00:55:29.870
is above everything else – and does not
respect a Sahaja yogi, there’s something

00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:32.180
wrong with him.

00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:38.450
He should understand that this spiritual person
is higher than all these people who have these,

00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:46.880
all kinds of these big names behind them.

00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:59.570
And that love is shown in everybody’s life:
all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone

00:55:59.570 --> 00:56:09.769
had that love which was above everything else,
without expecting anything, not doing it just

00:56:09.769 --> 00:56:13.960
to expect something from them.

00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:24.690
It is a kind of a personality which really
reflects God’s love.

00:56:24.690 --> 00:56:27.090
That reflection should come from you.

00:56:27.090 --> 00:56:35.240
You are Sahaja yogis: that doesn’t mean
that you are something higher than others,

00:56:35.240 --> 00:56:38.269
but you are different.

00:56:38.269 --> 00:56:41.300
You are above them.

00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:44.400
You have no superiority, that’s why you
are different.

00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:49.270
You are so humble, that’s why you are different.

00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:55.070
You are so joyous, you are so peaceful, that’s
why you are humble.

00:56:55.070 --> 00:57:04.930
There are so many things I can tell you from
the life of Shri Krishna, showing He was,

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:08.640
they call Him Yogeshwara.

00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:11.570
He was a Lord of Yoga.

00:57:11.570 --> 00:57:17.490
It is because He was Virat.

00:57:17.490 --> 00:57:30.620
But He showed it, His form, only to Arjuna,
to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna.

00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:36.290
Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that.

00:57:36.290 --> 00:57:46.730
So He lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy
He was living in Gokul, and He never showed

00:57:46.730 --> 00:57:48.410
off His powers.

00:57:48.410 --> 00:57:57.310
His powers were within Himself, which were
expressing spontaneously.

00:57:57.310 --> 00:58:08.060
This power has wisdom and discretion, complete
discretion.

00:58:08.060 --> 00:58:17.101
If it does not have then this is not divine
power, this is some satanic power: because

00:58:17.101 --> 00:58:26.060
somebody is nice to you if you are nice to
that person, nothing doing.

00:58:26.060 --> 00:58:34.710
Mostly we had in India people who were called
as avadhutas.

00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:42.810
They were the realized souls who had gone
away from the society, from the multitudes,

00:58:42.810 --> 00:58:53.170
and gone and lived in some small little place
or some cave or somewhere, hidden from others;

00:58:53.170 --> 00:59:02.080
because they thought nobody is going to understand
them, so what’s the use of talking to them.

00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:08.630
They were singled out, one person here and
one person there.

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:09.730
What could they do?

00:59:09.730 --> 00:59:15.660
They were not like you, so many of Sahaja
yogis together.

00:59:15.660 --> 00:59:20.070
You have so many friends and you have so many
others with you.

00:59:20.070 --> 00:59:26.210
They were lonely people, and they hid themselves
from the society.

00:59:26.210 --> 00:59:32.570
They would not meet people, because if they
tried anything they would be crucified.

00:59:32.570 --> 00:59:38.680
But not you people, because you have a society.

00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:51.509
You have a beautiful enlightened society of
very good friends, of very good spiritual

00:59:51.509 --> 00:59:52.670
people.

00:59:52.670 --> 01:00:02.110
With all this if you cannot create, then what
should I say?

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:14.940
You have to create something: may be art,
may be music, may be poetry, may be literature,

01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:20.370
may be writing – whatever it is, you have
to create.

01:00:20.370 --> 01:00:24.519
And above all, you have to create Sahaja yogis.

01:00:24.519 --> 01:00:28.850
That’s the main creation you have to achieve.

01:00:28.850 --> 01:00:37.010
That’s the main thing you have to have,
is creating Sahaja yogis all over.

01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:43.940
And there I can go to places, can have programs,
do everything.

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:52.390
But you have to show with your own example
that this is something great, how they have

01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:58.850
achieved this state; we should achieve also
that state.

01:00:58.850 --> 01:01:11.009
So you will be the ones who will really inspire
them, who will really make them follow you

01:01:11.009 --> 01:01:15.660
and take to a life of a Sahaja yogi.

01:01:15.660 --> 01:01:24.690
Actually you are Mahayogis, if you become
complete – and you have to become.

01:01:24.690 --> 01:01:34.210
Nothing is more important than becoming a
Mahayogi, by which your spirit gives joy,

01:01:34.210 --> 01:01:42.090
peace and blessings to everyone.

01:01:42.090 --> 01:01:48.390
May God bless you.
