1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Good.

2
00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.600
Good.

3
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.840
We will now tell some stories, Sari stories,

4
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:19.320
and each story is such a proof of the love of Shrimataji for each one of her children.

5
00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.680
It's so beautifully worth to hear all these stories, and it's only the Divine who can handle such situations.

6
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.280
So,

7
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:44.120
my first story of Sari was in 1985 in Vaitarna.

8
00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:55.600
It was the announcement of the first year of the weddings, the first year of the weddings that took place in Ganapati Pule.

9
00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:03.560
And when I heard my name and the name of my husband, we went to see, to meet.

10
00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:08.280
We didn't look at each other, we just said Namaskar.

11
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.880
And near was a big table with a lot, a lot of Sarvis.

12
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.360
And Shrimataji was here, and near Shrimataji was Gregoire.

13
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.600
And Gregoire said, a Sarvis for this man, please, Shrimataji.

14
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:37.520
And in one second, Shrimataji too picked up a Sarvis out of these mountains of Sarvis.

15
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.720
And this is the Sarvis she picked up. Can we see it?

16
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.040
Yes, don't hold it. Just hold it a little bit further away from it. Perfect. That's perfect.

17
00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:01.920
And the Sarvis has the colour of the earth, you see, and a nice border.

18
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.200
And my husband, Shrimataji gave the Sarvis to my husband.

19
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.000
And my husband said, what should I do with it?

20
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:18.360
He meant, should I keep it or should I give it to you?

21
00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.880
And me in my brain, just a lot of thoughts.

22
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:34.360
It was, but I bought already my wedding Sarvis, and I don't have any money to pay this new Sarvis.

23
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:40.200
So my first sentence to my husband was, you have to pay it.

24
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.520
This is the story, the first one.

25
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:59.080
The second story was in Poland in the 90s, in the hotel in Warsaw where Shrimataji was staying.

26
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:08.280
I was with her in her room, and suddenly she gave me this Sarvis.

27
00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:15.400
A red one with a border, blue one.

28
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:21.560
And when I saw the Sarvis, I was completely moved.

29
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:29.560
And I looked at her and I said, Shrimataji, you have so many children all over the world.

30
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.840
How do you know that pink is my favourite, not pink, red is my favourite colour?

31
00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.840
And she just smiled and looked at me and she said,

32
00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:49.560
you see, you are my children and I know everything about you.

33
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:59.640
And I heard this situation again, she was talking about this situation in a puja who was following afterwards.

34
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:10.760
And in this puja she said yes, and this lady, she was so moved to see that I knew the colour of her Sarvis.

35
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:21.480
And finally, the last story that I got from Shrimataji.

36
00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:33.480
It was in 2009 when Shrimataji came to Vienna in our new ashram.

37
00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:44.120
Of course we were happy to have her in Vienna, but on the other hand it was the time where she was looking sick.

38
00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:54.520
She was in a wheelchair, she didn't interfere like we were used to with her, she was no more talking with us.

39
00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:01.080
It was in a way very sad to see her like this.

40
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:16.680
So we have this new ashram in Vienna, but since 2006 we have also a new centre, a Sahaj Centre in the centre of Vienna.

41
00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.640
And we knew that she will not be able to go there.

42
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:31.880
So with Steve Jones we prepared an album with the pictures of this centre to show to Shrimataji.

43
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:40.120
And we could immediately go in her room. So she was sitting near her was Sir Siphi.

44
00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:46.200
Sir Siphi was holding this album and showing Shrimataji the pictures.

45
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:58.760
And Steve was just explaining how it is, which programmes and so giving explanations.

46
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:08.520
And in the moment where he said, and Shrimataji, this centre is mostly run by ladies.

47
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:19.000
In this moment she looked at me, she smiled to me and she did like this with her head.

48
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.280
Later on Shrimataji was giving presents to people.

49
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:40.120
So I got this sari, this red, not red, green sari with a border, gold and so on.

50
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:46.440
My dear, just hold it up again without moving it and a little bit further back from the camera.

51
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.880
Like this?

52
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:50.760
Yes, higher.

53
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:52.360
Perfect.

54
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.720
You see, like this?

55
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.300
Yes.

56
00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:55.180
Yeah.

57
00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:04.200
But the story is not finished because some months later I met a yogini who told me,

58
00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:09.800
I'm glad to see you Christine, because you see, I observed something.

59
00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:14.680
I was looking the video where Shrimataji was giving presents to yogis.

60
00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:23.960
And she said for each present, Sir Siphi took the hand of Shrimataji to put it on the present

61
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:25.160
to be vibrated.

62
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:34.680
She said, but for your sari, Shrimataji immediately put her hand on your sari without the help of Sir Siphi.

63
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:42.440
And for me, it was clear that it's not destined in a way to me.

64
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:52.840
Before we presented this new center, Postgasse, and for me it was this delicate, this great

65
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:57.240
way of Shrimataji to give blessings to this center.

66
00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:06.760
This center now is running till 2006, every day of the week, without interruption.

67
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:18.280
We have programs, music, German, English, Russian, we have workshops, we have other

68
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:18.840
meetings.

69
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:28.200
I mean, it's just running, the vibrations are so strong still since 2006 and flowing.

70
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:34.360
And this is just a blessing of Shrimataji.

71
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.760
Jai Shrimataji.

72
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:48.360
Christine, I wonder if you ever thought of donating that last sari to the center itself?

73
00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.400
Oh, a photo?

74
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:55.240
No, donating that sari to the center.

75
00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:57.400
Please?

76
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:05.560
I wondered if you ever thought of donating that sari to the center, to the Sahaj Center?

77
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:12.840
No, because I was, how to say, taking,

78
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.680
Oh, right, you'd already worn it.

79
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.480
You'd already worn it before.

80
00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:23.160
Yeah, I wore it before.

81
00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.160
Before you'd heard that, before you realized.

82
00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:29.240
I didn't notice this, you see.

83
00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:29.960
Right.

84
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:35.160
It just some months later, a yogini told me this.

85
00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:37.160
I didn't notice it.

86
00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.120
But then you realized, yeah.

87
00:09:40.760 --> 00:09:43.480
Yeah, so I wore it already.

88
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.200
Wow.

89
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.880
Christine, the beautiful, beautiful stories.

90
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.200
I'm just going to stop, pause the recording a second.

91
00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:56.520
Yes.

92
00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:05.560
So, Dara, thank you for sharing your stories with us next.

93
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:10.840
You know, I wasn't going to even I thought, Oh, you know, I actually don't have saris

94
00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.440
at mother personally.

95
00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:13.320
I mean, I do.

96
00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:22.040
I just want to share it just for me, like when I first came to Sahaja Yoga, I found

97
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.800
myself about a month later in Ro Ma Shram.

98
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.360
And I had no clothes because all the clothes I had were weren't appropriate for Sahaja

99
00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:34.840
Yoga.

100
00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:41.320
And so I was a bit perplexed.

101
00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:43.400
What what should I what can I wear?

102
00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:45.160
I had nothing almost.

103
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.920
And Jane, dear Jane Marlowe.

104
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:56.200
She said to me, Oh, Dara, it's no problem, because then she brought me to this room.

105
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:02.600
This is the old Ro Ma Shram, the first one, and she brought me to this room and this room.

106
00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:07.720
The whole wall of it was filled with saris.

107
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.640
She said, anyways, we're to wear saris every day.

108
00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:19.320
And, and, and, and she handed me a sari and showed me how to put it on.

109
00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:23.560
And I fell in love with with the saris.

110
00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.000
It's, it's something fabulous for me.

111
00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:37.560
It's something I don't know this beauty of like Sri Draupadi being covered in this protection

112
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.120
of mother.

113
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.800
And it's one piece of fabric.

114
00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:48.520
And yet it's it's the each piece of fabric is such a gorgeous artwork and fold it up.

115
00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:53.640
It's like it's like surrounding the whole universe.

116
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.560
It's just every woman looks beautiful in a sari doesn't matter if you're thin your your

117
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:01.240
any shape.

118
00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:06.280
A woman just look like queens in the sari.

119
00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:17.560
And, and for me, this is I just can thank mother, just that graciousness that when you

120
00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.920
put a sari on that, you walk differently.

121
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:27.720
I just I just love I just love the I love saris.

122
00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:37.800
So I don't have any saris left from from Rama's from that was this was 3637 years ago, but

123
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:44.920
I do have my we had the India tour, we were given saris by mother and these are the ones

124
00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:46.360
the two ones I have left.

125
00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.200
I just show the border the cotton is super thin now.

126
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:55.320
But there's just these beautiful, beautiful borders on it.

127
00:12:56.120 --> 00:13:04.600
And this, this the colors, it's just something fantastic.

128
00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:10.040
And I always when I'm looking for a sari to buy, I always try to find saris with these

129
00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:16.840
very traditional, just very simple, one color with with this beautiful borders.

130
00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:23.640
And yet when you wrap it around, it's just so elegant.

131
00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:24.520
It's so nice.

132
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:38.040
I'll tell I'll tell the the one of the later stories of I was in India, I had the opportunity

133
00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:49.160
to be in India for three months this winter and this past winter and and we I stayed in

134
00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:55.720
Alibaba and and the mummy there she she gave me this, this beautiful sari.

135
00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:04.760
This beautiful sari top piece.

136
00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.680
And as a gift when I left.

137
00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:22.840
And so when we went, we went to Delhi, and we stayed at Nirmal Dharm and it was it was

138
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:28.520
February and it was literally ice cold there there was there's no heating obviously.

139
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:36.360
And you walk you would go out the building and walk across the grass and the grass was

140
00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:37.480
it was ice.

141
00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.320
It was literally ice on the grass.

142
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:49.560
And so for the morning meditation at six, so, so the last morning, I was, I was like,

143
00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:54.920
I'm just not gonna bother just too cold because you're just sitting there shivering.

144
00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:58.680
You can't really meditate properly because it's just so cold.

145
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.280
But so Manfred left to go meditate and then I stayed and then I thought, Oh, shoot, I'm

146
00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.080
just gonna go.

147
00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:13.160
So I quickly put on a Punjabi and I opened the door to go out and I couldn't leave.

148
00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:15.240
I couldn't go out of the door.

149
00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.640
Something was stopping me.

150
00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:20.120
So I, I thought, What is it?

151
00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.960
And I thought, Okay, you have to put a sari on.

152
00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:28.680
So I took this sari and I put it on and and it's it's super thin.

153
00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:29.800
It's for summertime.

154
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:40.760
And I put my under my silk underwear underneath coat and jacket and sweaters and shawls and

155
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:48.200
trudged across the grass and got there as soon as as soon it was as it was time almost

156
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.240
for RT.

157
00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:51.640
They always have RT at the end of the meditation.

158
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.800
And I walked in and I sat down and namaskar.

159
00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:01.480
And, and I got up and somebody was standing there and said, Can you please do RT to mother.

160
00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:12.600
So in Nirmal Dham when you do RT for mother, you go in to this, there's a glass enclosure

161
00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.040
around mother Swayambhu.

162
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:25.000
And you enter this and they give you everything and then they close the door behind you and

163
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.600
you can't hear anything.

164
00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:28.200
You can't hear a thing outside.

165
00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:33.720
And they're playing the recording of the RT.

166
00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:40.440
And you can't hear that you can't hear the planes crossing overhead or anything.

167
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:51.880
So basically, it's just whoever is in there doing RT and mother and you're you're at the

168
00:16:51.880 --> 00:17:01.640
end, there's mother's Swayambhu and, and mother's silver padukas, and all these beautiful

169
00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:07.640
flowers and then you're standing with the tray there and singing by yourself RT.

170
00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:17.560
And it's just the most incredible experience.

171
00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:23.720
And I was like, Thank you, whoever, whichever deity wouldn't let me leave the room without

172
00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.840
putting a sari on because they only let people with saris on do the RT.

173
00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:31.880
So, yes, thank you.

174
00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:33.080
I can't see anybody.

175
00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.840
It's a bit disconcerting.

176
00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.520
Do you think everybody can put their

177
00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:40.520
Unknown Speaker I mean, Dara, it's part of the recording

178
00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:46.920
requirements, really, okay, because it and yeah, it's just easier for the recording of

179
00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:48.680
people's videos are turned off.

180
00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:53.720
Okay, I know it's very difficult for the person talking because you kind of talking into a

181
00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:54.200
vacuum.

182
00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:55.000
Yes.

183
00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:58.520
But that was a beautiful, beautiful story.

184
00:17:58.520 --> 00:17:59.480
Unknown Speaker Yes.

185
00:18:01.160 --> 00:18:01.960
There's this.

186
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.960
This, there's when when when Jeeva, my first child was born, this is 1991.

187
00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:19.240
And Manfred went on India tour, and he came back with seven saris for me, from the one

188
00:18:19.240 --> 00:18:31.160
mother always had saris that she had purchased, and she, she would then have them there to

189
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:34.200
sell and, and so Manfred went and bought seven saris.

190
00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:37.320
And each one was like one was more beautiful than the other.

191
00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.360
And I was just like, in shock seven saris.

192
00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:52.600
And then there was this sorry, there was this sorry, which is very simple, very somehow

193
00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:56.600
compared to the other ones that had no designs on it, just very simple and plain.

194
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.240
And I just kind of put that one on the side.

195
00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:07.720
And we were living with another couple then and and and Ganga she said to me, Did you

196
00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:09.000
see that blue and red?

197
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:09.560
Sorry.

198
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.320
And I because she had been on the tour.

199
00:19:11.320 --> 00:19:15.400
Also, I said, Yes, these other ones are so beautiful.

200
00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:23.080
She said, Do you know, this are these saris mother had very few of them, she said, and

201
00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:26.280
nobody bought them because they were so expensive.

202
00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:31.560
And, and the next day, mother got really angry at all the husbands.

203
00:19:31.560 --> 00:19:35.160
And they said, You have to buy these for your wife.

204
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.440
These are the most these are the most precious saris.

205
00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:40.280
It's been our silk.

206
00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:46.040
I don't know if that says means anything to anybody unless they're Indian.

207
00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:56.280
But it's, it's, it's a very special silk, hand woven, and the border has real gold in

208
00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:56.600
it.

209
00:19:56.600 --> 00:20:01.160
And unfortunately, it's all it's all shredded.

210
00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.280
It's so old now.

211
00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.280
I can't wear it anymore.

212
00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.600
But I just have it there.

213
00:20:07.080 --> 00:20:10.600
I hope I don't know what to do with saris that you can't wear anymore.

214
00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.280
But it's precious.

215
00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:15.560
These are one's mother's mother has specially chosen.

216
00:20:16.680 --> 00:20:21.880
And there was also in, oh, I don't have it here.

217
00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.680
Like Christie.

218
00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:23.400
Oh, there it is.

219
00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.640
This this sorry.

220
00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:33.480
It was in in by Tarna also like Christine, we had already been married for one year.

221
00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:43.080
And she was choosing this the the the saris for the brides, which I wasn't anymore.

222
00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:48.360
But then she said, you know, the other ladies can come and I'll choose them.

223
00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.160
Sorry.

224
00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:55.640
So I went I was there looking at saris and I picked up this bright pink sorry.

225
00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.000
And she mattered.

226
00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.840
She came and said no, no, no, no, no, no.

227
00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:02.680
I was held was I 2728.

228
00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:10.040
Like nowadays you were shocked is like, and she said, and she picked this sorry out for me.

229
00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:15.400
Again, I can't wear it anymore because it's so worn through.

230
00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:25.000
She said, older ladies need to wear they need to wear lighter colors.

231
00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:29.320
And, you know, I was 28.

232
00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:33.160
And I was a bit in shock.

233
00:21:35.080 --> 00:21:38.040
Not because I didn't think I was older.

234
00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:45.960
But I mean, actually, in those days in Sahaja Yoga, we were all with like 2830 the oldest

235
00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.760
ones because they were, they were very few.

236
00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:51.960
Like now we're all older.

237
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:58.120
But in those days, you know, we were I guess with that age, older.

238
00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:05.640
And, but I understood from mother that, that I have that not that I'm an older lady, but

239
00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:07.320
that I have to mature.

240
00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:17.160
And then I'm no longer that I'm no longer young, I'm no longer an unmarried woman that

241
00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:19.320
I have to behave with a certain dignity.

242
00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:19.560
Now.

243
00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:27.240
It was it was it was a very humbling and experience.

244
00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:36.360
And I felt such love and care for mother that she that she somehow taught me like instead

245
00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.920
of reprimanding me and saying, you know, you have to, you have to behave differently that

246
00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:46.760
she did it in such a sweet and gentle way by choosing a sorry for me.

247
00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:49.800
And I also love this.

248
00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:55.640
I just I don't know what I mean, he might know what to do with sorry, you can't wear

249
00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:56.120
anymore.

250
00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.880
But yes, that one.

251
00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.280
It's, it's like, thank you, mother.

252
00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:10.840
And, and, and, and this sorry, was from the saris mother.

253
00:23:11.480 --> 00:23:16.280
It was a Navarachupa in Kibana and mother had just been in Japan.

254
00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:19.720
And she had brought back their polyester saris.

255
00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:22.440
But she brought back these

256
00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:27.480
saris in all different colours.

257
00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:33.080
And yes, she said they're very unique.

258
00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.720
So they've got a weave in it and a print on it.

259
00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:39.720
So they're they're really nice.

260
00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:41.020
Sorry.

261
00:23:42.040 --> 00:23:46.200
And yes, I just love saris.

262
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:49.160
I feel it's that it's that hot.

263
00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:54.600
It's that essence of a womanhood.

264
00:23:56.120 --> 00:24:01.960
When you put a sari on, you feel mother's protection and you feel this

265
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:05.000
grace.

266
00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.240
You walk differently.

267
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:13.800
It's, it's, I've every time there's an opportunity to wear a sari put one on it.

268
00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.520
It's such an honour I feel to be able to use them.

269
00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:25.240
And, and this is the last I just showed you this sorry, because when I was in India, I

270
00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:34.840
was with my sister in law and we were sorry shopping in Delhi and and we just we were

271
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.320
like nearly the whole day in this shop.

272
00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:42.840
And, and I this I just it just so beautiful.

273
00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:44.920
They're just such a work of art.

274
00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:45.720
They sorry.

275
00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.200
That's the wrong way around.

276
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:48.700
Yes.

277
00:24:48.700 --> 00:25:00.780
So it's not for an older lady, I suppose because it's not it's not a light colour, but I do

278
00:25:00.780 --> 00:25:01.280
love it.

279
00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:10.380
And yeah, I was going to take another sorry and there was a young boy was helping us and

280
00:25:11.100 --> 00:25:12.860
I said, No, let me just take this.

281
00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:13.260
Sorry.

282
00:25:13.260 --> 00:25:14.300
It was very simple.

283
00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.740
It was a light colour was it was very plain.

284
00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:21.580
And the young boy who was helping us out.

285
00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.580
He said, he said to me, he said, You look like the mother in law.

286
00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:32.380
If you buy this, sorry, you're like the mother in law.

287
00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:40.060
And I regret and I, we burst out laughing hysterically because I am actually the mother

288
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:44.060
in law I was with my I was with the mummy of my daughter in law.

289
00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:45.280
Fine.

290
00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:46.180
Sorry.

291
00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.200
So we were we were both laughing hysterically.

292
00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.640
And then we told him that I am actually the mother in law.

293
00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:00.160
But she's she she said I should buy the sorry also so and that the other one was boring.

294
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:02.080
So there you go.

295
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.920
Those are my stories and and thank you for listening.

296
00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.600
And yeah, Dara, I know exactly what you mean.

297
00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.960
I was just saying somebody the other day that when I wear a sorry,

298
00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:18.240
I walk with a gravity and serenity that I don't have it other times.

299
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.040
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

300
00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:33.200
And it's, I wish you know, like that that Draupadi and and when Trump was president the last time,

301
00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:44.880
actually, I prayed that that the woman of America can be clothed and mothers all these sorrys that

302
00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:52.320
mothers given she said mother said once that Draupadi probably had all the sorrys that

303
00:26:52.880 --> 00:27:02.240
was protected by all the sorrys that that we've all we've all offered to her during the poojas.

304
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:11.120
And so I prayed and I pray now that that the women of America and all over the world that

305
00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:16.880
they're they have that protection of the sorry of mothers sorrys around them.

306
00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:27.040
And that that all these horrible men they they they're shocked that they're that they're shocked

307
00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:42.480
by the that that by that Dharma of Sri Sita of Draupadi of Sri Radha of that, that it stuns them

308
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:51.360
and and they recognize mother it's it's my deep prayer. Yes. So with that, I

309
00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:57.760
Yeah, should we just give a bandana for all the ladies in the world who need that protection?

310
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.440
I feel like yes.

311
00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:11.440
And that the men recognize that all the women are their mothers are their sisters are the queens

312
00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:17.600
and that they bow down before the goddess, the innate goddess.

313
00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:22.720
Then

314
00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:49.600
.

315
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:23.600
So for the last stories today we go to Padmini.

316
00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:35.600
I'm just going to share first a couple of pictures of Shimashi wearing a certain sari.

317
00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:53.600
Padmini, would you like me to show both before you start talking about them?

318
00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.600
Yes, please.

319
00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.600
So this is one and this is the other.

320

My name is Padmini. I'm from Chiripune. My husband is John Watkins and he's from UK.

324
00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:41.600
We are married in 1988.

325
00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:50.600
But I have a long time waiting to come to UK. In the end, Shri Mataji asked to come to Kabela.

326
00:30:50.600 --> 00:30:56.600
I was very lucky to stay with Shri Mataji's home in Kabela.

327
00:30:56.600 --> 00:31:03.600
We used to live in the Mezineh ground floor.

328
00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:13.600
That time I got the chance to make Shri Mataji's lunch, dinner and breakfast.

329
00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.600
And serving her breakfast every day.

330
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:23.600
And Shri Mataji told us before you cook our food, always meditate.

331
00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:27.600
Kyutbandana and Kundalini. Then you start the food.

332
00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:31.600
We used to do the same thing.

333
00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.600
And it was such a joyful early morning.

334
00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:39.600
We would serve Shri Mataji tea after the breakfast.

335
00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.600
And Shri Mataji would look like she's your friend.

336
00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.600
You're feeling so joyful at the start of your days.

337
00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:54.600
And one day Shri Mataji showed me how to make her bed.

338
00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:59.600
How to make the hospital. She showed me how to make it.

339
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.600
And it just looked like she showed your mother and your small child.

340
00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:07.600
How to show each thing.

341
00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:10.600
And such a feeling with Shri Mataji.

342
00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.600
Just feeling you are really lucky with God.

343
00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.600
And all that time spending with her.

344
00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.600
Really, really good.

345
00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:27.600
And one day we had to go to the picnic.

346
00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:32.600
Go to Dalia with Shri Mataji's grandchildren and Shri Mataji.

347
00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:35.600
And that time I'm just alone in the kitchen.

348
00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.600
And she came in the kitchen and she said,

349
00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.600
Today the children they love is to the paratha and keema.

350
00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:45.600
It looks like minced lamb they call.

351
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.600
And she showed me how to cook it.

352
00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.600
The lamb fat she's taking out all the fat first.

353
00:32:51.600 --> 00:33:01.600
And after that all the garam masala is clove, cinnamon, cardamom and ginger and garlic.

354
00:33:01.600 --> 00:33:07.600
And do it cook and put the onion and then after the keema.

355
00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:09.600
And it's such a lovely.

356
00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:11.600
And she's holding the pot with her hand.

357
00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.600
And I said, Shri Mataji, it's a very hot pot.

358
00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.600
She said, No, no. It's okay for me.

359
00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:18.600
And then she cooked and then give into my hand.

360
00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:25.600
She said, Just try to taste and it so look like when I have this food, my Kundalini just come up.

361
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.600
Unbelievable.

362
00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.600
Adi Shakti coming and showing cooking this thing.

363
00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:35.600
And we went to picnic Dalia and we went to the small river.

364
00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600
They really, really enjoyed that day.

365
00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.600
Such an amazing time.

366
00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:44.600
And another thing.

367
00:33:44.600 --> 00:33:53.600
One day, Shri Mataji wash her hair and she said, I should dry her hair with ajwain smoke.

368
00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:57.600
You know, they put some charcoal and they put ajwain.

369
00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.600
And drying her hair look like so well with her hair.

370
00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.600
But really, really careful in them because sometimes they really spark ajwain thing.

371
00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.600
And unbelievable that experience.

372
00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:12.600
Such a lovely, tremendous thing.

373
00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:20.600
And one day, Shri Mataji asked, saying to me, I got some special saree for you.

374
00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:26.600
And she went inside and she got the saree for me.

375
00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.600
And we like to see the photograph open.

376
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:30.600
I can show you.

377
00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:35.600
You can see in open the things.

378
00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:40.600
This is the saree.

379
00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.600
This is the pink part, Shri Mataji.

380
00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:43.600
She's wearing.

381
00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:45.600
She needs to have a camera on you.

382
00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.600
Yeah.

383
00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.600
You can see?

384
00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.600
No, no. She can't. They can't because the photo is there.

385
00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:55.600
Let me just, let me just stop sharing now.

386
00:34:55.600 --> 00:35:03.600
Ah, this is the, and this is the border here.

387
00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:04.600
Yes.

388
00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:09.600
And she said, Shri Mataji said, she wear long time this sarees.

389
00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:15.600
And very beautiful cotton and beautiful design inside.

390
00:35:15.600 --> 00:35:19.600
All are in pink color inside.

391
00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:22.600
You see properly?

392
00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.600
Yes, we can see properly.

393
00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.600
John, if you just hold it still, it's best done.

394
00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:32.600
Yes.

395
00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:34.600
Beautiful.

00:35:36.600 --> 00:35:39.600
And she wear in Australia and seaside.

397
00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:40.600
She went that time.

398
00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:44.600
And so this saree.

399
00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:57.600
John, can you show the pink side once more?

400
00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:04.600
Yes.

401
00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.600
Beautiful.

402
00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:13.600
And she gave me matching shawl also.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.600
The sarees matching shawl and

404
00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:20.600
cardigan also.

405
00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:22.600
This is a shawl.

406
00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.600
Yes, we can see it beautifully.

407
00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.600
And this is a cardigan.

408
00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:34.600
That's cardigan.

409
00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.600
It's matching all the stuff.

410
00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600
Wow.

411
00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:40.600
Wow.

412
00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600
Yeah.

413
00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:55.600
Kept you walking to Bella during the winter there.

414
00:36:56.600 --> 00:37:05.600
And the cardigan, I use the shawl and some few time I saw it, but shawl I use, but cardigan I just keep it as a stage of things, you know.

415
00:37:05.600 --> 00:37:09.600
It's a special thing, you know.

416
00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600
And.

417
00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:20.600
It's a really tremendous thing, you know, she watches this given thing.

418
00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:24.600
And in Kabela, you can see she matters every day.

419
00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:35.600
Even after the puja, after puja finish, she used to come inside the Kabela house and wash off the feet and all the kung kung water, all the vibratory water.

420
00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:39.600
And you can use this water to put your sasara around.

421
00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:44.600
You know, sometimes you can put it in the face and such a amazing, tremendous time in Kabela.

422
00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.600
And we are so lucky.

423
00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.600
My husband used to work in Kabela.

424
00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:53.600
All the angels, all he done in Kabela.

425
00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:07.600
And one day, Shri Mataji looking at that angels, you know, one of the UK saw Jogida and she said, call him, say, can you see the angels?

426
00:38:07.600 --> 00:38:08.600
And he said, yeah.

427
00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:11.600
And she said, look at these angels.

428
00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:16.600
John Vorkison put his angel and still have love come from these angels.

429
00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:17.600
You can see.

430
00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.600
And that story is very nice.

431
00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:25.600
And if you go to Kabela, I can see the three big angels entrance that's made my husband.

432
00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.600
And.

433
00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:36.600
And we have my first baby born in Kabela, close to Novi Lugera Hospital.

434
00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.600
And Shri Mataji hold her when she turned this old.

435
00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:46.600
And Shri Mataji gave her name as a Menaxi because her eyes look like fish.

436
00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.600
And she said one of the goddesses name.

437
00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:54.600
And she said, this is a very, very old soul born.

438
00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:58.600
And my daughter is so lucky when Shri Mataji hold her.

439
00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:00.600
It's such an amazing time.

440
00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:04.600
Now, we used to use go to all fujas and.

441
00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:11.600
And although after the fujas, see the shivaji every single day.

442
00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.600
It's a really tremendous time.

443
00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.600
I saw, we are so lucky.

444
00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:23.600
Shri Mataji our mother and attending the fuja and enjoying each other's really, really.

445
00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:24.600
Thank you for Shri Mataji.

446
00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600
Thank you Shri Mataji.

447
00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.600
Can I just add that, you know, we had a difficult time.

448
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.600
John, John, could you just move into the picture then as you're talking?

449
00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:40.600
Yes, slowly.

450
00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:50.600
At a difficult time, the British government refused Padmini a visa and Shmash's attention was on it for a long time.

451
00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:52.600
So we had a very difficult time.

452
00:39:54.600 --> 00:40:02.600
After about five years, it took before we were actually together and it was quite a tapasya.

453
00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:06.600
But at the end of it, we had all those blessings.

454
00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.600
I got to work in Kabbalah and Padmini eventually came to Kabbalah.

455
00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:20.600
So the Divine knows the right time because there were just so many blessings at the end of it all when we were finally together.

456
00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:26.600
The Divine knows the right time for everything and we both knew that it was meant to be.

457
00:40:27.600 --> 00:40:29.600
It was just wonderful.

458
00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:34.600
Anyway, Shri Mataji.

459
00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:41.600
And thank you Shri Mataji for giving us as a soldier of life and all over the world, brothers and sisters.

460
00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.600
Thank you very much.

461
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.600
Jai Shri Mataji.

462
00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.600
Jai Shri Mataji.

463
00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.600
Jai Shri Mataji.

464
00:40:55.600 --> 00:41:05.600
I think when I came back to the UK, I got a shwajee call one day, a massage of feet.

465
00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:09.600
Very tremendous, amazing vibration.

466
00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:18.600
And in the healing house, one day night, Shri Mataji and me and Shri Mataji's granddaughter, we were just watching a movie.

467
00:41:19.600 --> 00:41:23.600
Shri Mataji massaged the granddaughter's head massage and I used to do Shri Mataji's feet.

468
00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.600
We were watching the whole night as a Hindu movie.

469
00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.600
And some in the movie, something happened and I was feeling guilty.

470
00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:33.600
Shri Mataji said, why are you feeling guilty?

471
00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:36.600
Because Shri Mataji just knows one thing.

472
00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.600
And the whole night, I was doing this massage of the feet and talking with her.

473
00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.600
It was such a joyful time.

474
00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:46.600
Wow.

475
00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:53.600
And then I feel, I have massaged Shri Mataji's feet, but I just said,

476
00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:57.600
before coming to healing, I went to the Shuddhi camp.

477
00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.600
I just said I like Shri Mataji's body massage.

478
00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:05.600
And then Shuddhi camp, she asked me to do her back massage and everything.

479
00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.600
I just, you feel like you're in the field and how joyful is it?

480
00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:11.600
Such an amazing time.

481
00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:14.600
You care so, healing and Shuddhi camp.

482
00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:19.600
And it just, when Shri Mataji moved from Shuddhi camp to healing house,

483
00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:21.600
such a tremendous joy for her.

484
00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:23.600
She looked like such a small child.

485
00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:31.600
And in the healing house, in her bathroom, John put all angels and she's so happy.

486
00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.600
Showing to Mr. CP, say look at these angels.

487
00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.600
And she just, you never see how her face looked like.

488
00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:43.600
Full of star and look like, just, I don't know how to work to explain her.

489
00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:48.600
So just look like Christmas, such a joyful time.

490
00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.600
She moving in the healing house, you know.

491
00:42:51.600 --> 00:42:52.600
Wow.

492
00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:56.600
Just saying that we don't have a cabinet to catch her, you know.
