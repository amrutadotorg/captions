00:00:17.638 --> 00:00:21.824
It is inaction.

00:00:21.927 --> 00:00:28.581
When you say , how we should do it, then we are thinking, that is not sahaj.

00:00:28.613 --> 00:00:34.130
	You cannot go back saying that I don’t do anything.

00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:40.327
You are all the time forward, moving forward, saying how?

00:00:40.352 --> 00:00:46.363
	How to do? How to go forward?

00:00:46.388 --> 00:00:57.644
Accepting that this event takes place towards consciousness

00:00:57.669 --> 00:01:02.102
and that consciousness itself makes it happen.

00:01:02.127 --> 00:01:07.015
We should stop trying to make any effort completely.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:12.203
When we are in Akarma then only this consciousness takes place.

00:01:12.228 --> 00:01:15.255
That means you don’t have to do anything at all.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.695
This is a very difficult task for human beings.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.604
If nothing else is there, man keeps thinking.

00:01:20.629 --> 00:01:28.809
But when this event takes place, thoughts also stop.

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:31.693
Because till now whatever daily spiritual practice you have seen

00:01:31.718 --> 00:01:34.889
you have to do some or the other action.

00:01:34.914 --> 00:01:38.686
And all these actions will take you outwards.

00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:43.473
Sahaja Yoga is an event that takes place inside.

00:01:43.498 --> 00:01:46.925
When people ask how to surrender?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:54.191
It is clear cut, you do not have to do anything,  you are surrendered.

00:01:54.216 --> 00:02:01.796
Man has never walked at this speed in this direction till now.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:04.703
So it is a new thing for him

00:02:04.728 --> 00:02:08.547
and a new path in which he does not have to do anything.

00:02:08.572 --> 00:02:10.859
Events take place on their own.

00:02:10.884 --> 00:02:15.129
Because he has done a lot and has gone very far away from his inner self

00:02:15.154 --> 00:02:18.883
and that is why it is very difficult to pull such a person inwards.

00:02:18.908 --> 00:02:23.762
That is why someone’s Kundalini gets awakened instantaneously

00:02:23.787 --> 00:02:31.923
whereas for some even their awakened Kundalini falls down again.

00:02:31.948 --> 00:02:36.331
Nothing is to be done, this is surrendering.

00:02:36.356 --> 00:02:41.197
When you reach that point, nothing is to be done.

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:44.595
Where you don't say anything, you are thoughtless.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.673
But this also has to be done.

00:02:48.698 --> 00:02:51.348
A human being has to do this also.

00:02:51.373 --> 00:02:54.796
So, leave it to the one who will do it.

00:02:54.821 --> 00:02:56.634
You don't have to do anything.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:02:58.038
You just leave it.

00:02:58.063 --> 00:03:00.350
If someone new has come and asks what do we need to do

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:03.559
just open your palms towards me.

00:03:03.584 --> 00:03:06.614
keep your hands straight like this and it will happen.

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.554
For those for whom this event does not take place

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.767
these people here will help you afterwards.

00:03:10.792 --> 00:03:12.848
Today there are so many Sahaja Yogis here

00:03:12.873 --> 00:03:14.756
and each of them has achieved his self-realization.

00:03:14.781 --> 00:03:18.375
Not only that, they have a very deep knowledge of the Kundalini science.

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.774
Each one of them  seated here is proficient in the Kundalini science

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:29.201
and  the Kundalinis of thousands of people by just using their finger movements

00:03:29.226 --> 00:03:31.549
can raise and not only that, they can also give them self-realization.

00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:33.688
And you may ask why don’t they do it then?

00:03:33.713 --> 00:03:39.324
The reason is that people do not come to Sahaja Yoga very easily.

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:42.218
It is very difficult for a human being to come to a place

00:03:42.243 --> 00:03:44.817
where it is told that you don’t have to give any money

00:03:44.842 --> 00:03:47.453
where you don’t have to do anything, but just have to sit in silence.

00:03:47.478 --> 00:03:51.561
But when they start  sinking, they come.

00:03:51.586 --> 00:03:54.781
That is why Sahaja Yoga cannot work too fast

00:03:54.806 --> 00:03:59.540
because  in Sahaja Yoga, you have to give up some thing.

00:03:59.635 --> 00:04:04.260
Meaning that we have to do something

00:04:04.285 --> 00:04:08.373
we have to think about something or we have to stand on our head

00:04:08.398 --> 00:04:10.568
or we have to perform some Dravidi Pranayam (Hatha yoga)

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:14.437
or we have to read some books or we have to memorize some texts

00:04:14.462 --> 00:04:20.104
or we have to say some mantras, just leave all this.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:24.998
Then after getting your self-realization

00:04:25.023 --> 00:04:27.666
you become deserving.

00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.917
Then whatever needs to be done, happens

00:04:30.942 --> 00:04:36.041
Akarma only, inaction only, comes into action.

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:38.901
karma becomes chariot.......

00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:41.612
So how? See for yourself.

00:04:41.637 --> 00:04:44.643
Whatever has to happen will happen and whatever has not to happen, will not.

00:04:44.668 --> 00:04:48.229
There is no compulsion in this, no argument.

00:04:48.254 --> 00:04:51.073
For whom it has to happen will happen, and for whom it doesn’t have to, it will not.

00:04:51.098 --> 00:04:53.024
	If someone has blockages in chakras, it is there.

00:04:53.049 --> 00:04:56.140
It can be taken out but cannot be argued.

00:04:56.165 --> 00:04:59.423
People have various issues, for example, people say we did not do it

00:04:59.448 --> 00:05:01.482
If they have blockages, they do have.

00:05:01.507 --> 00:05:02.983
These should be taken out.

00:05:03.008 --> 00:05:07.763
Now look for your own selfishness, know the meaning of your self.

00:05:07.788 --> 00:05:12.701
This is not going to benefit me, it benefits you only. fully

00:05:12.726 --> 00:05:14.988
Only you are going to get all the benefit.

00:05:15.013 --> 00:05:24.719
Understand this and open your palms like this.

00:05:24.744 --> 00:05:26.260
When the event takes place

00:05:26.285 --> 00:05:29.876
first kundalini rises and crosses the Agnya chakra.

00:05:29.901 --> 00:05:35.776
When this happens you become thoughtless

00:05:35.824 --> 00:05:37.137
We should say 'Samadhi'.

00:05:37.162 --> 00:05:43.649
But Samadhi does not mean being unconscious, going into trance, 'No'.

00:05:43.674 --> 00:05:46.617
Then you are totally conscious and aware.

00:05:46.642 --> 00:05:50.807
You are fully alert but at the same time you are thoughtless and silent.

00:05:50.832 --> 00:05:52.615
But you are listening to everything

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:58.041
and there are no thoughts arising inside from your ego or superego.

00:05:58.066 --> 00:06:00.302
You are in peace and joy.

00:06:00.327 --> 00:06:06.329
And when Kundalini pieces your Fontanel bone then inside you these vibrations

00:06:06.354 --> 00:06:08.948
about which Shankaracharya has spoken, start flowing.

00:06:08.973 --> 00:06:10.580
It is so straight-forward.

00:06:10.605 --> 00:06:12.562
You don’t have to do anything in this.

00:06:12.587 --> 00:06:16.665
Like one lighted candle can instantaneously lit another

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:18.625
and take the lamp from the finite to the infinite

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.405
it happens the same way.

00:06:21.430 --> 00:06:27.933
There is no role of intelligence in this.

00:06:27.958 --> 00:06:32.128
	Everyone put your hands like this and sit comfortably.

00:06:32.153 --> 00:06:33.698
Those who have not received their self-realization yet

00:06:33.723 --> 00:06:37.308
should keep their eyes open for some time.

00:06:37.333 --> 00:06:44.969
If you have a problem while sitting down, you can sit on chair, no problem.

00:06:45.104 --> 00:06:49.956
Are you sitting comfortably?

00:06:49.981 --> 00:06:52.513
If someone’s hands are shaking

00:06:52.538 --> 00:06:58.232
keep eyes open, otherwise keep your eyes closed.

00:06:58.257 --> 00:07:00.380
Even with the eyes closed

00:07:00.405 --> 00:07:24.447
if the eye-lids are moving then you can open your eyes.

00:07:24.472 --> 00:07:28.554
Those who are swimmers they will first teach you how to swim.

00:07:28.579 --> 00:07:31.259
So keep sitting peacefully. Don't move your hands and feet.

00:07:31.284 --> 00:07:33.906
They will come and teach you.

00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:36.307
( NOT CLEAR )

00:07:36.332 --> 00:07:41.323
Close your eyes. Close your eyes, you close your eyes.

00:07:41.348 --> 00:07:46.586
Are your eyes moving? Do you have any guru?
