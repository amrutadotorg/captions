WEBVTT

00:17.638 --> 00:21.824
It is inaction.

00:21.927 --> 00:28.581
When you say , how we should do it, then we are thinking, that is not sahaj.

00:28.613 --> 00:34.130
	You cannot go back saying that I don’t do anything.

00:34.155 --> 00:40.327
You are all the time forward, moving forward, saying how?

00:40.352 --> 00:46.363
	How to do? How to go forward?

00:46.388 --> 00:57.644
Accepting that this event takes place towards consciousness

00:57.669 --> 01:02.102
and that consciousness itself makes it happen.

01:02.127 --> 01:07.015
We should stop trying to make any effort completely.

01:07.040 --> 01:12.203
When we are in Akarma then only this consciousness takes place.

01:12.228 --> 01:15.255
That means you don’t have to do anything at all.

01:15.280 --> 01:17.695
This is a very difficult task for human beings.

01:17.720 --> 01:20.604
If nothing else is there, man keeps thinking.

01:20.629 --> 01:28.809
But when this event takes place, thoughts also stop.

01:28.834 --> 01:31.693
Because till now whatever daily spiritual practice you have seen

01:31.718 --> 01:34.889
you have to do some or the other action.

01:34.914 --> 01:38.686
And all these actions will take you outwards.

01:38.711 --> 01:43.473
Sahaja Yoga is an event that takes place inside.

01:43.498 --> 01:46.925
When people ask how to surrender?

01:46.950 --> 01:54.191
It is clear cut, you do not have to do anything,  you are surrendered.

01:54.216 --> 02:01.796
Man has never walked at this speed in this direction till now.

02:01.821 --> 02:04.703
So it is a new thing for him

02:04.728 --> 02:08.547
and a new path in which he does not have to do anything.

02:08.572 --> 02:10.859
Events take place on their own.

02:10.884 --> 02:15.129
Because he has done a lot and has gone very far away from his inner self

02:15.154 --> 02:18.883
and that is why it is very difficult to pull such a person inwards.

02:18.908 --> 02:23.762
That is why someone’s Kundalini gets awakened instantaneously

02:23.787 --> 02:31.923
whereas for some even their awakened Kundalini falls down again.

02:31.948 --> 02:36.331
Nothing is to be done, this is surrendering.

02:36.356 --> 02:41.197
When you reach that point, nothing is to be done.

02:41.222 --> 02:44.595
Where you don't say anything, you are thoughtless.

02:44.620 --> 02:48.673
But this also has to be done.

02:48.698 --> 02:51.348
A human being has to do this also.

02:51.373 --> 02:54.796
So, leave it to the one who will do it.

02:54.821 --> 02:56.634
You don't have to do anything.

02:56.659 --> 02:58.038
You just leave it.

02:58.063 --> 03:00.350
If someone new has come and asks what do we need to do

03:00.375 --> 03:03.559
just open your palms towards me.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.614
keep your hands straight like this and it will happen.

03:06.639 --> 03:08.554
For those for whom this event does not take place

03:08.579 --> 03:10.767
these people here will help you afterwards.

03:10.792 --> 03:12.848
Today there are so many Sahaja Yogis here

03:12.873 --> 03:14.756
and each of them has achieved his self-realization.

03:14.781 --> 03:18.375
Not only that, they have a very deep knowledge of the Kundalini science.

03:18.400 --> 03:24.774
Each one of them  seated here is proficient in the Kundalini science

03:24.799 --> 03:29.201
and  the Kundalinis of thousands of people by just using their finger movements

03:29.226 --> 03:31.549
can raise and not only that, they can also give them self-realization.

03:31.574 --> 03:33.688
And you may ask why don’t they do it then?

03:33.713 --> 03:39.324
The reason is that people do not come to Sahaja Yoga very easily.

03:39.349 --> 03:42.218
It is very difficult for a human being to come to a place

03:42.243 --> 03:44.817
where it is told that you don’t have to give any money

03:44.842 --> 03:47.453
where you don’t have to do anything, but just have to sit in silence.

03:47.478 --> 03:51.561
But when they start  sinking, they come.

03:51.586 --> 03:54.781
That is why Sahaja Yoga cannot work too fast

03:54.806 --> 03:59.540
because  in Sahaja Yoga, you have to give up some thing.

03:59.635 --> 04:04.260
Meaning that we have to do something

04:04.285 --> 04:08.373
we have to think about something or we have to stand on our head

04:08.398 --> 04:10.568
or we have to perform some Dravidi Pranayam (Hatha yoga)

04:10.593 --> 04:14.437
or we have to read some books or we have to memorize some texts

04:14.462 --> 04:20.104
or we have to say some mantras, just leave all this.

04:20.129 --> 04:24.998
Then after getting your self-realization

04:25.023 --> 04:27.666
you become deserving.

04:27.691 --> 04:30.917
Then whatever needs to be done, happens

04:30.942 --> 04:36.041
Akarma only, inaction only, comes into action.

04:36.066 --> 04:38.901
karma becomes chariot.......

04:38.926 --> 04:41.612
So how? See for yourself.

04:41.637 --> 04:44.643
Whatever has to happen will happen and whatever has not to happen, will not.

04:44.668 --> 04:48.229
There is no compulsion in this, no argument.

04:48.254 --> 04:51.073
For whom it has to happen will happen, and for whom it doesn’t have to, it will not.

04:51.098 --> 04:53.024
	If someone has blockages in chakras, it is there.

04:53.049 --> 04:56.140
It can be taken out but cannot be argued.

04:56.165 --> 04:59.423
People have various issues, for example, people say we did not do it

04:59.448 --> 05:01.482
If they have blockages, they do have.

05:01.507 --> 05:02.983
These should be taken out.

05:03.008 --> 05:07.763
Now look for your own selfishness, know the meaning of your self.

05:07.788 --> 05:12.701
This is not going to benefit me, it benefits you only. fully

05:12.726 --> 05:14.988
Only you are going to get all the benefit.

05:15.013 --> 05:24.719
Understand this and open your palms like this.

05:24.744 --> 05:26.260
When the event takes place

05:26.285 --> 05:29.876
first kundalini rises and crosses the Agnya chakra.

05:29.901 --> 05:35.776
When this happens you become thoughtless

05:35.824 --> 05:37.137
We should say 'Samadhi'.

05:37.162 --> 05:43.649
But Samadhi does not mean being unconscious, going into trance, 'No'.

05:43.674 --> 05:46.617
Then you are totally conscious and aware.

05:46.642 --> 05:50.807
You are fully alert but at the same time you are thoughtless and silent.

05:50.832 --> 05:52.615
But you are listening to everything

05:52.640 --> 05:58.041
and there are no thoughts arising inside from your ego or superego.

05:58.066 --> 06:00.302
You are in peace and joy.

06:00.327 --> 06:06.329
And when Kundalini pieces your Fontanel bone then inside you these vibrations

06:06.354 --> 06:08.948
about which Shankaracharya has spoken, start flowing.

06:08.973 --> 06:10.580
It is so straight-forward.

06:10.605 --> 06:12.562
You don’t have to do anything in this.

06:12.587 --> 06:16.665
Like one lighted candle can instantaneously lit another

06:16.690 --> 06:18.625
and take the lamp from the finite to the infinite

06:18.650 --> 06:21.405
it happens the same way.

06:21.430 --> 06:27.933
There is no role of intelligence in this.

06:27.958 --> 06:32.128
	Everyone put your hands like this and sit comfortably.

06:32.153 --> 06:33.698
Those who have not received their self-realization yet

06:33.723 --> 06:37.308
should keep their eyes open for some time.

06:37.333 --> 06:44.969
If you have a problem while sitting down, you can sit on chair, no problem.

06:45.104 --> 06:49.956
Are you sitting comfortably?

06:49.981 --> 06:52.513
If someone’s hands are shaking

06:52.538 --> 06:58.232
keep eyes open, otherwise keep your eyes closed.

06:58.257 --> 07:00.380
Even with the eyes closed

07:00.405 --> 07:24.447
if the eye-lids are moving then you can open your eyes.

07:24.472 --> 07:28.554
Those who are swimmers they will first teach you how to swim.

07:28.579 --> 07:31.259
So keep sitting peacefully. Don't move your hands and feet.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.906
They will come and teach you.

07:33.931 --> 07:36.307
( NOT CLEAR )

07:36.332 --> 07:41.323
Close your eyes. Close your eyes, you close your eyes.

07:41.348 --> 07:46.586
Are your eyes moving? Do you have any guru?
