Shri Devi Puja. Rahuri (Hindistan)
26 Ocak 1984

2
00:02:40,125 --> 00:02:46,083
Rahuri has a special significance in the history of the Goddess,

3
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:55,166
that when the horrible rakshasa, called Rahu,

4
00:02:58,125 --> 00:03:02,333
started ruling this area and devastating it.

5
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:09,125
The whole suffered, all the God-fearing people ….

6
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:15,583
Then the Goddess took Her incarnation

7
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:21,709
here and She killed this man, this rakshasa

8
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:25,250
and there are different places

9
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:28,709
where how he ran, how She caught him

10
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:33,709
and ultimately killed – he was killed in Rahuri.

11
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:40,250
And that’s why rahu-ri – “ri” starts from the Hrim,

12
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,333
as you know that: Aim, Klim, Hrim

13
00:03:44,709 --> 00:03:49,333
are the three words denoting the three powers of the Goddess.

14
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:54,041
Aim, Hrim and Klim: Aim is the Mahakali,

15
00:03:55,625 --> 00:04:01,709
Hrim is the Mahalakshmi and Klim is the Mahasaraswati.

16
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:07,583
So, with the Hrim-power She killed this rakshasa,

17
00:04:07,709 --> 00:04:11,250
and then – after that killing –

18
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,333
bhaktas started living here.

19
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,500
And a king came all the way from Rajpur,

20
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:23,709
Rajputana – and started worshipping the Goddess.

21
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:32,041
And went – he was a poor man, he came here as a poor man –

22
00:04:33,583 --> 00:04:37,041
while worshipping the Goddess

23
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,709
he raised this again into another kingdom,

24
00:04:43,542 --> 00:04:46,583
and that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas

25
00:04:46,709 --> 00:04:50,041
because they carry the shawl of the Goddess.

26
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,375
This Shalivahanas, later on in the dynasty, was a [INDIST., SOUNDS LIKE Bhobruvaha]

27
00:04:57,709 --> 00:05:00,333
who fought with the [INDIST. SOUNDS LIKE Maharaja]

28
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:04,041
and defeated him, who was from Ujiara [?]. Surprisingly

29
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:07,125
many of My relations are still in Ujiara

30
00:05:07,458 --> 00:05:10,208
and they are following a new vision.

31
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,333
So because he fought him

32
00:05:15,542 --> 00:05:21,041
and he captured him

33
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,208
many people from here shifted there

34
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:29,458
and settled down in Ujiara.

35
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:36,667
Now this Rahuri developed gradually

36
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:42,125
into a very modern city,

37
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,709
or you can say in a modernized.

38
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:52,500
And when we go to [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Nankhara] you will be able to see it.

39
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:55,709
The forefathers

40
00:05:56,333 --> 00:05:58,625
of Mine were called as Shalivahanas

41
00:05:59,041 --> 00:06:03,125
and My mother`s place [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE Rhaduvas] where they resided and lived.

42
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:07,041
So Rahuri has a special significance

43
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,041
in the life of Sahaja Yoga, or I should say in My own life.

44
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:16,542
And that is why surprisingly that in Rahuri we have established

45
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:21,291
our center in the biggest way.

46
00:06:21,709 --> 00:06:24,291
Because the kings here worshipped

47
00:06:24,709 --> 00:06:29,500
the Mother with a shawl.

48
00:06:30,166 --> 00:06:35,041
Now this has a special meaning as the significance

49
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,041
goes, or you can say the symbolic - it is -

50
00:06:38,208 --> 00:06:41,208
it covers the modesty of the Mother.

51
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:45,709
Mother protects us, She looks after us.

52
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:49,041
So this is the one which covers Her,

53
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:53,166
gives Her the grace,

54
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,291
gives Her the protection from the cold

55
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,709
and when the children are suffering,

56
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:06,333
or are tired, or are sick She covers them with the shawl.

57
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,625
So the shawl has a very big meaning

58
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,458
and because the used to carry the shawl of the Mother

59
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,709
all the time in their hands,

60
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,000
that’s why they are called as Shalivahanas.

61
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:22,542
So the significance of Rahuri is very great

62
00:07:22,709 --> 00:07:24,709
and you will also see that

63
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:30,375
in the gross also the people here are very receptive to Sahaja Yoga.

64
00:07:30,709 --> 00:07:36,709
Even the factory people – I went to see them before I came here,

65
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,083
to talk to them. And they are so much submerged

66
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,291
in the developments of Sahaja Yoga

67
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,458
and amount of things they want to do,

68
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,709
and want to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga here.

69
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,041
As they are built for you especially too

70
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:53,583
was made with great care about from that they thought

71
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:57,041
that it was finished and worked very hard.

72
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:01,000
Day and night, just to prepare this hall for you.

73
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,375
So this is how it is going to work out,

74
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:07,041
and last time I told them that you should not make

75
00:08:07,291 --> 00:08:10,583
an alcohol out of these molasses

76
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:13,125
[??] and sell it at the market at a cheap rate,

77
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,500
but make something useful.

78
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:17,166
So they are trying to find out

79
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,458
a technique about which I talked to them now.

80
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:22,709
So they are very religious people also.

81
00:08:23,208 --> 00:08:25,333
And they are trying to improve the lot of the people,

82
00:08:25,542 --> 00:08:30,709
by removing all these addictions among the people.

83
00:08:32,709 --> 00:08:35,709
So that is the significance of Rahuri-Puja

84
00:08:36,291 --> 00:08:39,083
and that’s what it is, that you are like Shalivahanas

85
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:44,667
who are worshipping the Mother and Her shawl.

86
00:08:45,542 --> 00:08:48,709
So today’s Puja has a special significance

87
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:53,709
– that’s why Rahuri we have very good Sahaja Yogis here,

88
00:08:54,333 --> 00:09:00,166
very developed, very evolved, moral people.

89
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,625
They are not scholars of Sanskrit,

90
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:07,166
but they are scholars of Sahaja Yoga.

91
00:09:07,625 --> 00:09:12,208
There is a difference between being a scholar of Sanskrit

92
00:09:12,458 --> 00:09:14,542
and a scholar of Sahaja Yoga.

93
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:21,250
Now for you people I hope it has been a comfortable

94
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:26,583
stay for you here and

95
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:33,458
we hope also for the future you are going to enjoy

96
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:39,041
your journey and enjoy the bliss of the Divine!

97
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:47,583
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

98
00:10:13,667 --> 00:10:15,542
We don’t read about Rahul`s killing,

99
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:18,333
because it is Mahalakshmi who killed,

100
00:10:18,667 --> 00:10:22,709
but what we read in the Devi-Mahatmya is the Mahakali`s powers.

101
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:27,041
But Rahul was killed here in Rahuri by Mahalakshmi,

102
00:10:27,709 --> 00:10:32,333
and that Mahalakshmi power is called as Hrim power,

103
00:10:32,709 --> 00:10:34,500
so that’s why this is Rahu-ri.

104
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:40,250
Actually it is Rahu-hrim we can say it is Rahu-ri to make it simple.

105
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

106
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,000
And according to that calendar only

107
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,709
all the Maharashtrians are living,

108
00:11:31,208 --> 00:11:35,667
which is very, I should say, much more subtler than vikram,

109
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,625
this thing. Because in the [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: vikram-panjaga]

110
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:43,000
this area is still called as Kali-Yuga, Kali-Yuga,

111
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:46,583
but in this [INDIST: SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga; Then: Shalivahana-Panjaga]

112
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,417
it is called as Krita-Yuga. It’s much subtler.

113
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:53,667
That’s a very wider thing

114
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:58,041
and it doesn’t give you the different sections

115
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,333
of Kali-Yuga, that how it becomes Krita-Yuga

116
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,542
and ultimately a Satya-Yuga.

117
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:11,709
The calendar that was used by the North Indians

118
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,709
was the Vikram, and the South Indians used the Shalivahana,

119
00:12:16,125 --> 00:12:20,583
but especially in Maharashtra. But the support came mainly from

120
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:25,333
[INDIST.] direct, who said that this is the better [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: panjaga]

121
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:31,625
because it deals with subtler side of time.

122
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:33,667
Subtler side of time.

123
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:37,709
And that’s why it was regarded as a greater thing.

124
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:43,458
Now on the first day of

125
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:48,458
this calendar they put a kalasha

126
00:12:49,041 --> 00:12:55,041
[? A pot] with a shawl as a banner, a kalasha and a shawl as a banner.

127
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,333
That’s why kalash, which is the Kundalini, is the Aquarius.

128
00:13:04,041 --> 00:14:26,083
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

129
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:29,709
In the older days all the Maharashtrian women used to have

130
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:35,709
some sort of an additional cloth, a shawl, which they used to carry.

131
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,667
If it was a marriage then they used to have a marriage sari,

132
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:41,709
[INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: completed with that shawl].

133
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:46,291
All the time they had to wear something, a covering over the sari.

134
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,458
Sari was not the end-cloth but now we have become modern,

135
00:14:49,667 --> 00:14:54,709
so we don’t use the, that, another cloth which one has to use.

136
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:57,709
So, but this is only the custom.

137
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:01,250
In India is not the point, it is not only in Maharashtra, everywhere.

138
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,709
But there, because a dress was not a sari,

139
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,125
but those who bore the sari did not use, in the North.

140
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:11,375
But here those who use the sari also use the shawl, on top of that.

141
00:15:11,667 --> 00:15:14,625
And that’s why, you see, this country has a speciality,

142
00:15:14,709 --> 00:15:18,125
this part that they always had this shawl,

143
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,333
whether they went out, for their protection,

144
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:22,709
or they went for a marriage

145
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:26,166
or anything they used to have another thing on top.

146
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:29,458
Now of course we have, symbolically, something modernized.

147
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:32,333
This is, wearing little pieces to be used as shawls.

148
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:35,458
You see, everything is getting modernized.

149
00:15:36,500 --> 00:16:13,709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

150
00:18:08,709 --> 00:18:13,709
You must, all right, touch the feet of this Rahuri-Land.

151
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:26,083
Then after, Ganesha, we must also touch the feet.

152
00:18:27,709 --> 00:18:31,291
As soon as I get the land, first we establish Ganesha here,

153
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,250
and once this land, we get

154
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:35,625
everywhere in the whole world, we get land

155
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,667
and we have no problems of any kind as far as the land is concerned.

156
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:43,667
When the Ashram is built here, everywhere in the whole world

157
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,709
we’ll have Ashrams. So the beginning has to be at the right place.

[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

159
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:24,333
They have come all the way from Germany.

160
00:19:49,291 --> 00:21:01,709
[Shri Mataji talks in Marathi; then the Puja starts]

161
00:28:15,709 --> 00:28:19,250
[during the Puja:] Husband and wife, are you? Ha?

162
00:28:19,667 --> 00:28:22,625
You both are husband and wife – are you?

163
00:28:23,041 --> 00:28:25,625
You have to be husband and wife! [Yogi: Yes!]

164
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:31,709
Shri Mataji: You are? You both are husband and wife? [Yogi: Not!]

165
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:39,709
Shri Mataji: Yes! [Shri Mataji talks in Marathi]

166
00:28:40,166 --> 00:28:44,041
Means: the husband and wife should sit together!

167
00:28:44,625 --> 00:28:47,333
That’s the only time when a man and a woman

168
00:28:47,458 --> 00:28:51,166
sits together in this country. Not the brother.

169
00:28:51,458 --> 00:28:56,709
Not even sisters and brothers. Only husband and wife.
