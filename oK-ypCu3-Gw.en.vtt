00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.265
Shri Mataji: I’m here only for 5 minutes more.

00:00:04.265 --> 00:00:09.030
How many photographs you have taken?

00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:11.546
I don’t see them.

00:00:11.545 --> 00:00:16.310
You see, so many take my photograph.

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:22.796
Actually, I’m the greatest photographed person.

00:00:22.796 --> 00:00:24.120
[Laughter]

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.220
But I don’t see those photographs.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.847
So, they should be sent to some –

00:00:28.847 --> 00:00:30.665
Sahaja Yogi: We send it to Geoffrey (Godfrey).

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:33.180
Shri Mataji: Somebody who can pass it on to me.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.780
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, Geoffrey from&nbsp;
England, he’s collecting all these negatives.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.340
We handed it over to him and&nbsp;
he makes it out of CDs he said.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.080
Shri Mataji: He keeps all of them with himself.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.042
He never showed me.

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.869
Sahaja Yogi: Hopefully not.
[Laughter]

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:49.380
I don’t think so.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.780
Shri Mataji: He came down to see me.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.640
He never showed me any photographs.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.160
I told this, “What is this you’re&nbsp;
getting all the negatives and the rest?

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.660
I have not seen the photographs”.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.980
Sahaja Yogi: He thought, he&nbsp;
contacted me about two weeks ago.

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.680
And I sent all my slides and&nbsp;
negatives ahead to him to Cabella,

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.240
to just go through them, put&nbsp;
them into some system or so,

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.860
and he said then he will return it.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.100
But I can send you all the photographs and&nbsp;
videos whatever it is there, Shri Mataji.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.860
Shri Mataji: No, no, but why should you&nbsp;
lend negative, you can give photographs.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.820
Sahaja Yogi: OK.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.960
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.308
Each one should take negative.

00:01:26.308 --> 00:01:26.327
We can make copies.

00:01:26.327 --> 00:01:29.800
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, yes, yes.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.669
Shri Mataji: He’s a nice Sahaja Yogi.

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:32.700
He is a very good Sahaja Yogi, no doubt.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.640
But he’s not yet shown me any photograph.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.160
So, I’m going to tell him&nbsp;
that, “Please, show me first”.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.160
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:47.580
we have one Yogi in Austria who has a&nbsp;
complete container of photos from you.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:50.520
Yes, I have seen it two weeks ago.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.807
I didn’t know it myself.
[Laughter]

00:01:53.807 --> 00:01:54.720
Shri Mataji: So, I told you.

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.865
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. It is Willie, Willie Brenner.

00:01:59.865 --> 00:02:00.120
It’s a thick one.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.020
Really he made... he made such&nbsp;
a great work, you can’t imagine.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.599
He has a complete container, like in office.

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:09.150
Another Sahaja Yogi: A full shelf.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.957
Sahaja Yogi: Shelves.

00:02:09.957 --> 00:02:10.481
Shri Mataji: Where, in Austria?

00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:10.768
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:02:10.768 --> 00:02:11.360
Shri Mataji: It’s all in Austria?

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:20.520
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. I was standing there.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.900
I could not believe it.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.556
One photo after another,&nbsp;
and done and done and done.

00:02:25.556 --> 00:02:26.520
And packages!

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.900
Not one.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.540
For each one, he has 10 or 20.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.620
He is doing such a great job.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.324
Shri Mataji: Hope he has [unclear].
[Laughter]

00:02:37.324 --> 00:02:38.233
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:40.584
Shri Mataji: He has got [unclear].
[Laughter]

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:41.280
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.160
All right. So, now what to&nbsp;
do with this container one?

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.740
Now you could send some of&nbsp;
them, you see, at least a copy.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.900
So, you could see yourself.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.900
I know, because at every puja,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.660
there are at least 50 people.

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:05.160
If not 50, it would be 100.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.160
And they are all taking photographs.

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.540
You have an exhibition of those.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.227
These are photographs or negatives?

00:03:18.227 --> 00:03:19.320
Sahaja Yogi: Photographs.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.160
Both, photographs, negatives, everything.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.880
Shri Mataji: All kinds.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:30.360
Another Sahaja Yogi: Whatever negatives he gets&nbsp;
from Austrians, he just takes them and makes...

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.340
I mean, quite an enormous&nbsp;
number of photographs out of it.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.980
So, all different sizes.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:43.680
So, then he takes it to Cabella and&nbsp;
then he just sells it there to Yogis.

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.001
So, but if you want Shri Mataji, we can make a&nbsp;
full album, whatever we have, to give it to you.

00:03:49.001 --> 00:03:49.534
Shri Mataji: He is selling them.

00:03:49.534 --> 00:03:54.360
Sahaja Yogi: No, no. Yes, but he&nbsp;
doesn’t make profit out of it.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.400
Just to recover the cost.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.660
Shri Mataji: Then it’s all right.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.600
You’re not supposed to sell.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.820
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:12.600
I have a very big vision inside of me.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.820
We should send all these photos –

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:20.460
I want that all the journalists and&nbsp;
all the newspapers and press agencies,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:21.960
they should get your photos.

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.502
With your permission, we will send it to them.

00:04:24.502 --> 00:04:24.527
Shri Mataji: All of them?

00:04:24.527 --> 00:04:26.820
Sahaja Yogi: Sure, we can.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.220
Shri Mataji: I know one by one.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.083
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:33.023
Shri Mataji: In this one, see the photograph,&nbsp;
the other day, when I arrived at the airport.

00:04:33.023 --> 00:04:33.960
What a nice photograph it is.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:40.260
You saw this?

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.640
Very nice.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:44.820
I was quite tired also.

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.160
But I look quite fresh, you know.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:50.980
To convince people that I’m tired.
[Laughter]

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:59.040
All right.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.580
I’m thinking, I will just go around the market,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.020
just to give some vibrations,

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.140
because the whole day is lying there.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.720
And it would be nice.

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:14.940
We have come to Egypt to give&nbsp;
some vibrations after all.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.440
I’ve been here before, twice.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:21.060
You met such a nice man,&nbsp;
you know, this journalist.

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:22.380
Have you taken his address?

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.759
Sahaja Yogi: Sure.

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:28.200
Shri Mataji:&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.135
In all this, whatever has happened,&nbsp;
we found some nice people.

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:34.980
I am sure we’ll be able to work out.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:39.120
Ask him the address of that General also.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.383
Sahaja Yogi: The general? I have it.

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:42.180
Shri Mataji: You have?

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:45.180
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. I’m dealing with since 5 years.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.756
Shri Mataji: Such a [unclear].

00:05:50.756 --> 00:05:54.660
Djamel: Shri Mataji,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.740
whenever you are ready, the car is ready.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.870
Sahaja Yogi: Car is ready.

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.892
Shri Mataji: For what?

00:06:00.892 --> 00:06:02.160
Djamel: To go to the market.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:06.791
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:06:06.791 --> 00:06:10.415
May God bless you.

00:06:10.416 --> 00:06:14.040
May God bless you.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:17.700
Anyone of you coming to India?

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.907
Sahaja Yogi: Maybe some of some of us.

00:06:20.907 --> 00:06:20.940
Shri Mataji: ‘Atcha’ [Hindi].

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.700
Sahaja Yogini: I hope I can come.

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.137
Shri Mataji: Oh, you see there’s&nbsp;
for people from Israel, it’s free.

00:06:25.137 --> 00:06:35.903
If you are coming, you have to&nbsp;
just pay your ticket, that’s all.

00:06:35.903 --> 00:06:36.600
But&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.440
you send your name, first of all, that’s all.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.040
For people who are from Israel.

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:46.140
And also from Russia.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:50.100
Russians, also, they pay very little.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.766
But otherwise, everything is free.

00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:56.178
All right?

00:06:56.178 --> 00:07:04.138
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you very much.

00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:08.481
[Cut in the video]

00:07:08.481 --> 00:07:16.200
Shri Mataji [to the boy]: what?&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.120
A train?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.000
I don’t know if I can get&nbsp;
a good train for you here.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.620
That’s in Germany.

00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:39.660
We’ll see, we’ll see.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:41.100
I will see.

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:49.885
I don’t think they have very&nbsp;
good machinery goods here.

00:07:49.885 --> 00:07:53.220
I’ll see whatever I get, all right?
