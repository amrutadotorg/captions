1
00:00:20,012 --> 00:00:21,933
Shri Mataji: … the attachments
(microphone).

2
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:24,368
Warren: The attachments, it’s all right.
Shri Mataji: It’s all right?

3
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:28,240
Warren: It’s good in here because it is
very silent, then we don’t need any.

4
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:32,393
Shri Mataji: Good. It’s beautiful.
Warren: Is it Your first time in a church?

5
00:00:32,594 --> 00:00:33,855
Shri Mataji: No, many-a-times.
Warren: Many-a-times.

6
00:00:34,056 --> 00:00:37,575
Shri Mataji: But to talk about Agnya
in a church, is the first time.

7
00:00:37,776 --> 00:00:40,744
Warren: Very good.

8
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:07,457
Yesterday I told you about this chakra
which is a very fiery chakra,

9
00:01:07,658 --> 00:01:15,026
because this chakra is occupied by a very
fiery deity

10
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:17,886
called as Jagadamba, is the Mother
of the Universe.

11
00:01:18,087 --> 00:01:26,466
She has to protect Her children who are
trying to swim across the ocean of illusion

12
00:01:26,667 --> 00:01:37,110
and who are being always hampered
by the people who are against God,

13
00:01:37,311 --> 00:01:40,940
who are anti-Christ, who are anti-God,

14
00:01:41,141 --> 00:01:44,659
who are devils, who are called
as rakshasas.

15
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:47,806
And so She has to protect them,

16
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:54,739
and that’s why She is such a fiery
Goddess, like a tigress.

17
00:01:54,940 --> 00:02:01,377
Actually, one of Her conveyances is
a tiger, another is a lion.

18
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:08,566
After that, now today we want to know
about this chakra,

19
00:02:08,767 --> 00:02:13,668
which is the Vishuddhi chakra, Vishuddhi.

20
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:25,459
America, in the map of the world, is this
centre, is Vishuddhi chakra.

21
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:32,500
That’s why it is important to understand
what do we stand for, Americans.

22
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:36,499
Now, this centre has got 16 sub-plexuses,

23
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:41,380
and it manifests in the gross the cervical
plexus,

24
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:47,460
which looks after all the ears, nose,
throat, the eyeballs,

25
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:53,619
and the neck, all the problems of this
area.

26
00:02:53,820 --> 00:03:02,589
The facial construction depends on this
chakra:

27
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:11,483
whatever is the condition of this centre
you have the expression on your face.

28
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,589
As I told you it has got 16 sub-plexuses,

29
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:19,829
and all the vowels are created in this
centre.

30
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:23,510
Of course, English language has got
the vowels

31
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:27,047
which are not scientifically all right.

32
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:33,190
But the Devanagari script has got all
the vowels, are 16 in number,

33
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:38,638
and that’s why they are all produced here,
in this area.

34
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:42,709
This is the gross side of this centre.

35
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:50,151
The subtle side of this centre is that
this is the centre of collectivity.

36
00:03:51,550 --> 00:04:01,473
When man raises his head, he sees
around himself his fellowmen.

37
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,494
And he starts seeking that there must be
something very, very common between us –

38
00:04:08,695 --> 00:04:13,785
that we are part and parcel of one
universal Being,

39
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:18,886
of the great primordial Personality.

40
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:24,869
The central path of Sushumna –
of ascendance –

41
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,350
creates this primordial Being ultimately,
is the final,

42
00:04:29,550 --> 00:04:38,392
is the complete form of this ascendance,
of the evolution, ends up here.

43
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:44,230
So this is the primordial Being, if we say
this is the primordial Being,

44
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,950
and this is the primordial Vishuddhi.

45
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:52,985
Then this Vishuddhi is the one that
represents what Muslims say as the Akbar,

46
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:58,399
Akbar aspect of God, the Primordial
Great Being.

47
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,549
In Sanskrit language it is called as Virat.

48
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,989
Now, this primordial Being incarnated
on this earth –

49
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,871
as I told you that all this aspect
incarnates, the central aspect –

50
00:05:13,072 --> 00:05:17,378
on this earth as Shri Krishna.

51
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,940
And His power was Radha. Ra means
energy, dha means the one who sustains.

52
00:05:24,141 --> 00:05:29,190
Ra-dha: means the one who sustains
the energy is Radha.

53
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:32,990
So on this centre is Shri Krishna and
Radha.

54
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:36,390
On the right side is His image as a king:

55
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:41,660
when He went away from Gokul and Mathura

56
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:46,990
after killing a devil called Kamsa who was
His uncle actually,

57
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:51,047
He went down to Gujarat and settled down
there and ruled that country,

58
00:05:51,248 --> 00:05:55,158
there He was called as Vitthala. Vitthala
and Rukmini –

59
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,494
I’m telling you these names because when
you are raising the Kundalini,

60
00:05:58,695 --> 00:06:05,750
if the chakra stops there or the Kundalini
stops there, you have to take His name.

61
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:12,681
On the left-hand side is His sister, who
was just born and was killed again,

62
00:06:12,882 --> 00:06:19,710
and She appeared to us as a lightning
in the sky. She is called as Vishnumaya.

63
00:06:19,910 --> 00:06:25,607
All these three centres are very, very
important.

64
00:06:25,808 --> 00:06:31,482
When you are collective, then you are
ascending through this centre:

65
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,670
the power is passing through this.

66
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,910
Actually, the root of this (ego and
superego) starts from here (Vishuddhi),

67
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:40,603
the root starts from here and grows
into this (superego),

68
00:06:40,804 --> 00:06:43,603
and then into this (ego) crossing over.

69
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:45,385
The crossing over takes (place)
there (Agnya),

70
00:06:45,586 --> 00:06:51,890
but the root of the ego and superego
starts at this point.

71
00:06:53,148 --> 00:07:02,272
Shri Krishna as we know appeared
to Arjuna as a Virata,

72
00:07:02,473 --> 00:07:05,390
as the Great primordial Being.

73
00:07:05,590 --> 00:07:12,070
He saw Him as a very huge, big personality,

74
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,202
and he saw in Him all the human beings
and all the creations moving about.

75
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:22,567
And he couldn’t bear it anymore, he said,
“I don’t want to see it again.”

76
00:07:22,768 --> 00:07:31,350
Shri Krishna told the Gita, spoke the Gita,
only to Arjuna, only to one person.

77
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,990
He didn’t tell it to even a second person,

78
00:07:35,191 --> 00:07:37,950
because He was born six thousand years
back.

79
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:40,909
That time the maturity of people was so low

80
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:47,709
that He did not, He did not tell about this
to anybody else but Arjuna.

81
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:52,949
And it was heard by another person who
wrote it down,

82
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:56,229
and Vyasa is the poet who wrote about it.

83
00:07:56,430 --> 00:08:01,829
The Gita is the Vedanta, means the end
of Vedas.

84
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,619
Vedas have got two sides: the first side
is where the mantras are there

85
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:10,990
to excite the right side or we can say
the elements,

86
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:19,271
and the end of it is the philosophy.
And he used that philosophy of Gita,

87
00:08:19,472 --> 00:08:24,764
he used that Vedanta philosophy in Gita
to explain

88
00:08:24,965 --> 00:08:30,830
what is knowledge, what is God, what is
Spirit,

89
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,046
how to achieve it and what happens.

90
00:08:35,247 --> 00:08:43,709
Now Krishna’s basic character of His
advent was that:

91
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:48,278
so far for Rama He was the One who lived
like a human being

92
00:08:48,479 --> 00:08:59,232
and established a special place, or say,
established a special character

93
00:08:59,433 --> 00:09:02,933
of a benevolent king for other kings
to follow.

94
00:09:03,134 --> 00:09:09,700
But this one when He came, He found that
the whole place was filled with ritualism,

95
00:09:09,901 --> 00:09:16,576
with all kinds of dead supra-conscious
activities, and subconscious activities,

96
00:09:16,777 --> 00:09:23,430
and people were indulging into materialistic
things and were very unhappy –

97
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:32,430
so He established Himself as the incarnation
of the play, Leela.

98
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:39,270
That the whole world is just a drama, is
just a drama, and you are a witness to it.

99
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:46,429
Actually, what happens when you watch
a drama, you feel that you are in it –

100
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:50,325
supposing there is Napoleon or somebody
who is in the drama:

101
00:09:50,526 --> 00:09:54,003
you start feeling you are Napoleon, and
even when you go home,

102
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:58,196
you’ll talk like Napoleon for a while, you
carry on the joke with you.

103
00:09:58,397 --> 00:10:02,677
But it’s a drama, it’s outside you, it is
not you.

104
00:10:02,878 --> 00:10:07,069
Sometimes, when there is, say, a cinema
or something we see,

105
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:10,419
we identify ourselves with the scenes
so much

106
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:15,199
that we cry, weep, sometimes feeling
very excited.

107
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,684
But when the drama is over,

108
00:10:17,885 --> 00:10:21,450
then we’ll suddenly realise, “Oh God,
it was a drama.”

109
00:10:21,651 --> 00:10:27,515
In the same way, this whole life, the human
life, is a drama.

110
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:31,510
And the life… whole drama, is only seen

111
00:10:31,711 --> 00:10:34,870
when you get your realisation: you become
a witness.

112
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:37,830
Now those who have got realisation

113
00:10:38,030 --> 00:10:41,270
should understand that you have become
now a witness.

114
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,110
Start seeing everything and you’ll be
amazed.

115
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:48,018
You’ll feel, “Oh, I’m so much away,
I am just witnessing.”

116
00:10:48,219 --> 00:10:51,270
There’s a sahaja yogini who comes from,
who came from India.

117
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:53,588
And she had never travelled before
anywhere,

118
00:10:53,789 --> 00:10:55,629
even by plane she had never travelled
before.

119
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,270
And comes from a very traditional family,

120
00:10:58,471 --> 00:11:02,648
she has never been out without somebody
going with her. Such a person.

121
00:11:02,849 --> 00:11:05,830
She got her realisation and she came
to America.

122
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,829
She told me that “I never felt that I
was going to America,

123
00:11:09,030 --> 00:11:10,750
that I was going by plane anywhere,

124
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:13,430
that I should be frightened, nothing
of the kind.

125
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:15,103
And they were all telling me, ‘Be careful’,

126
00:11:15,304 --> 00:11:17,430
I was wondering, what are they worried
about?

127
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,950
I was least bothered, the whole thing
looked like a drama,

128
00:11:21,151 --> 00:11:25,260
I got into the plane, I came here and there
was a sea of human beings,

129
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:28,593
I couldn’t see my brother, and I think
I got lost!

130
00:11:28,794 --> 00:11:30,829
I said, “All right, if I am lost, doesn’t
matter.

131
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,281
I am never lost because I’m with myself.”

132
00:11:33,482 --> 00:11:36,145
So I was going to the taxi fellow, I was
going to tell him,

133
00:11:36,346 --> 00:11:38,190
“Take me down to my brother’s place”,

134
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,070
then suddenly the brother got her,
got to her and found her.

135
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:46,710
But otherwise she was saying, “I was
so relaxed, I was least bothered,

136
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:49,390
most surprising, I was witnessing the whole
drama

137
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:54,348
without any, without any consideration
about it,

138
00:11:54,549 --> 00:11:58,446
or any awareness about it, I was just
doing it automatically.”

139
00:11:58,647 --> 00:12:03,428
That’s what happens to you. You see
the death,and you see the life,

140
00:12:03,629 --> 00:12:08,442
and you see the drama. And you do not
get involved into it.

141
00:12:08,643 --> 00:12:15,218
When you are not involved into it, then
you are completely at ease and at peace.

142
00:12:15,419 --> 00:12:19,389
As I gave you the example that if you are
in the water,

143
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:21,749
then you are worried about the waves.

144
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:28,509
But supposing you get into the boat, then
you see the waves as fun.

145
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:32,870
Or if you know how to swim, also you can
see it as a fun.

146
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:36,645
So when you get realised, when you get
your realisation,

147
00:12:36,846 --> 00:12:39,470
then the whole thing becomes like a drama

148
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:43,629
and you start developing your detachment.

149
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:49,848
So He is the Yogeshwara: He’s the one
who is fully detachment.

150
00:12:50,049 --> 00:12:53,610
He’s the full detachment. Though He was
a king,

151
00:12:53,811 --> 00:13:00,320
though He was having a very luxurious life,
He was a detached personality.

152
00:13:00,521 --> 00:13:07,156
Now He on this earth when He came,
He had to have His powers with Him

153
00:13:07,357 --> 00:13:10,565
and He didn’t know how to bring those
powers in human beings,

154
00:13:10,771 --> 00:13:13,798
because He knew He won’t be able to give
realisation to people

155
00:13:13,999 --> 00:13:16,309
at that time, 6000 years back.

156
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:22,669
So He created a method by which He got
16.000 wives.

157
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,109
And all these wives were nothing but His
powers-carrying people

158
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:31,386
and there is a big story about it which
I think every Indian knows,

159
00:13:31,587 --> 00:13:35,361
and you can also find out.

160
00:13:35,990 --> 00:13:39,590
He had five - I mean, He became the king,
He did all this.

161
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:43,869
And He had five elements as His wives.

162
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:48,415
So His all queens, five of them, were
five elements,

163
00:13:48,616 --> 00:13:56,109
and 16.000 wives were actually His own
powers manifested as human beings.

164
00:13:56,310 --> 00:14:02,337
And He came on this earth as Krishna,
krishi: krishi means agriculture.

165
00:14:02,538 --> 00:14:10,064
Means actually sowing. He sowed the seed,
He sowed the seed of spirituality.

166
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:16,381
He said, “Nainam chindanti shastrani
nainam dahati pavakah.

167
00:14:16,582 --> 00:14:20,669
Nachainam kledayam tyapo
na shosayati maruta.”

168
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:26,230
Means this Spirit cannot be killed,
it cannot be sucked in,

169
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:33,349
it cannot be destroyed, neither it can
be transformed. Is eternal.

170
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,629
And to prove that, Christ came on this
earth, at this point.

171
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:42,149
And He by His resurrection proved it,
that it cannot be killed.

172
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:49,230
Now I will tell you about Shri Krishna’s
life as a diplomat, He was a diplomat.

173
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:53,429
He was the incarnation of diplomacy.

174
00:14:53,630 --> 00:15:01,669
And the best diplomacy is such that you
give such conditions which are absurd.

175
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,224
If you give absurd conditions,

176
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:09,181
then a person gets toppled down over it,
and then he succumbs.

177
00:15:09,382 --> 00:15:14,749
Because if you approach directly someone,
then the people are very half-baked,

178
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,509
and they start intellectualising everything
and rationalising.

179
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:22,742
So better thing is put a proposition before
them which is absurd,

180
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:27,095
and let them find out for themselves,
and then they come to you

181
00:15:27,296 --> 00:15:32,509
with surrendered mind. Now I’ll explain
to you how.

182
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:39,959
Arjuna was His disciple, and Arjuna,
when he went to war with Kauravas,

183
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:45,195
who were the satanic forces in those days,
got into a mood of despondence,

184
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:49,421
and he said that “These are – in these
are my relations, these are,

185
00:15:49,622 --> 00:15:53,554
there’s my one of my gurus who taught
me how to use the arrow –

186
00:15:53,777 --> 00:15:56,949
and how am I to fight these people?”

187
00:15:57,150 --> 00:16:02,117
So then He told the Gita, that time
He spoke the Gita to him.

188
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:07,008
And He said that – the first thing He said

189
00:16:07,209 --> 00:16:11,227
that you should find your Self, you must
have Self-knowledge,

190
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:15,830
you should get realisation, you should
have the knowledge.

191
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,990
Knowledge doesn’t mean the idea about
this architecture and all that,

192
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:25,269
but knowledge is the awareness of your
Spirit.

193
00:16:25,470 --> 00:16:30,030
So Arjuna being that time a mediocre,
I should say, an intellectual –

194
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:33,560
he asked Him a question, as usual
intellectuals are good at asking questions,

195
00:16:33,786 --> 00:16:36,033
never giving answers.

196
00:16:36,234 --> 00:16:41,110
So the intellectual asked Him that
“You are telling us to go to war,

197
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:44,629
and here You are telling me to find
my Spirit.

198
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:48,750
How do these two things meet?”, because
according to many people

199
00:16:48,951 --> 00:16:53,523
who are talking today also, that a man
who is realised should not fight,

200
00:16:53,733 --> 00:16:57,493
he should sit down and bear all the brunts
of the things upon himself,

201
00:16:57,710 --> 00:16:59,750
he should suffer.

202
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:04,590
So he said that “How do You say that
I become the Spirit

203
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,950
and then I have to fight these evil forces?

204
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,630
Why should I fight these evil forces then?”

205
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:15,341
So He said that “All right, he is a person
who is a mediocre,

206
00:17:15,542 --> 00:17:18,670
it’s very difficult to tell him how
to do it.”

207
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:24,710
Actually, it is very simple. When you are
a witness, you can fight better.

208
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,870
You have to fight the evil forces,

209
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,270
why are you enlightened if you cannot
fight the darkness?

210
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:33,190
You have been made a light to fight
the darkness,

211
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,190
and not to be happy with yourself: “Oh, I’m
the light, I’m the light, I’m the light.”

212
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,709
But you have to fight the darkness, and
this they would not accept,

213
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:46,509
that “Why should we fight the darkness?”
So He said, “All right.

214
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:49,942
What you do is to do what you want to do

215
00:17:50,159 --> 00:17:56,486
and put the fruit of your doing
at the Lotus Feet of the Lord.”

216
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,549
Now this is absurd, this is an absurd
condition.

217
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:07,175
Like you do your karmas, but put the fruit
of that at the Lotus Feet of the Lord.

218
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:10,309
It is an absurd condition, you just
can’t do it.

219
00:18:10,510 --> 00:18:15,353
Why? Because you have got Mr. Ego sitting
down there.

220
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:20,989
Whenever you do something, you always
say you are doing it.

221
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:26,762
And even if you say, “Oh, I have married
Christ and this is God’s work I’m doing”,

222
00:18:26,963 --> 00:18:32,899
you may say it, but in your heart of hearts
it is not so.

223
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,270
Because you have not got that hollow
personality where there is no ego.

224
00:18:37,509 --> 00:18:42,368
You must get rid of this ego, otherwise you
are doing the work and you are conscious –

225
00:18:42,569 --> 00:18:49,070
it’s a myth, actually human beings don’t do
anything whatsoever. It’s a myth.

226
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:53,630
For example, we have built this beautiful
church. Now what have you got?

227
00:18:53,831 --> 00:18:56,971
Whatever was created by God, you just
changed the forms of that

228
00:18:57,172 --> 00:19:00,310
and put it this way. Dead from the dead.

229
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:02,110
What living work have you done?

230
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:06,923
You cannot transform one flower into
a fruit, can you?

231
00:19:07,124 --> 00:19:11,589
So it’s a myth we believe in that we do
this, we do that, we do this.

232
00:19:11,790 --> 00:19:13,710
Actually you don’t do anything.

233
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:18,829
You only change forms of the dead from
this to that.

234
00:19:19,030 --> 00:19:23,855
And this myth that you have got, that
you do, accumulates here

235
00:19:24,056 --> 00:19:26,629
as this bile-coloured stuff on your head.

236
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:30,430
It can be quite big, here it is shown
it can be so big as that,

237
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:36,913
even bigger than your body, bigger than
this big dome.

238
00:19:37,114 --> 00:19:39,830
The one who must have made this
must have been –

239
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,131
may be having a bigger thing than that,
can be possible you see,

240
00:19:43,332 --> 00:19:46,990
and then he walked like this on the road,
you don’t know how to balance yourself

241
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:50,528
with all this big thing on your head,
all the time this ego telling you,

242
00:19:50,729 --> 00:19:56,827
“Oh, you are the great.” And you meet
such a person, better be careful.

243
00:19:57,028 --> 00:20:00,132
Keep away from people who have done
great works.

244
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,461
Otherwise they will use you for something
else.

245
00:20:03,662 --> 00:20:07,509
So keep away from all such people.
That’s what is the best.

246
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:11,469
So this Mr. Ego develops into a big thing.

247
00:20:11,670 --> 00:20:17,778
And when it develops, it just gives you
ideas that,

248
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:22,349
first of all it makes you think, “Oh, you
are great, you are very great.”

249
00:20:22,550 --> 00:20:24,670
And then sometimes you get punches on it,

250
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:28,539
because people don’t accept you as that
great as you think yourself to be,

251
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:30,750
then with the punch it grows even bigger –

252
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:33,950
with one more punch it’s like a rubber
balloon,

253
00:20:34,151 --> 00:20:37,005
you see, you punch it, it goes up, again
you punch it, it… -

254
00:20:37,206 --> 00:20:41,430
both ways it’s horrible: it can be pumped
in or it can be punched in.

255
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:46,469
And once it is punched in, then it can be
very, very big,

256
00:20:46,670 --> 00:20:49,430
and then you don’t know what to do,
so you recoil down

257
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,761
into your left Vishuddhi here.

258
00:20:54,597 --> 00:20:56,894
Then you say, “Oh, I should not have
done it”,

259
00:20:57,095 --> 00:21:01,949
because you think by doing that, your
ego is hurt.

260
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:05,408
You just go there to feel guilty, because
you think by doing that,

261
00:21:05,609 --> 00:21:08,450
your ego is hurt. Your image is spoilt,

262
00:21:08,651 --> 00:21:13,430
your so-called image of this big balloon
is spoilt so you feel hurt.

263
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:21,710
Now this happening of giving it or to
surrendering it at the Lotus Feet of Lord

264
00:21:21,910 --> 00:21:27,389
can only happen when your realisation
takes place.

265
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:31,094
Now those people who have got realisation,
what do you do?

266
00:21:31,295 --> 00:21:34,509
You say, “Mother, it is going, it is
coming.

267
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:39,789
It’s not going, it’s not working.”
You become a third person.

268
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:43,070
You raise the Kundalini – say you have
a friend, you bring the friend along.

269
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:45,030
Now, the friend doesn’t get realisation.

270
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:47,479
You don’t say, “I have given realisation”,

271
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,843
you don’t say, “I raised the Kundalini”,

272
00:21:50,044 --> 00:21:53,442
but what you do is to say that, “Mother,
it’s not yet working,

273
00:21:53,643 --> 00:21:57,646
it’s little hot this side, there’s a, this
finger burning, this chakra is catching.”

274
00:21:57,847 --> 00:22:02,190
But you say everything in the third person,
you never say “I do”.

275
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:06,179
Even if your son is not realised, or if
your father is not realised,

276
00:22:06,380 --> 00:22:10,372
you will tell him, “I’m sorry, you can’t
get realisation, it is not working.”

277
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:14,989
It. You become the third person.

278
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,270
And that is what it is, when it flows
you say,

279
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,710
“It’s flowing, it’s working, it’s there.”

280
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:24,390
This is the theory that He tried
to propound,

281
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:28,030
that the whole thing should become,
the karma should become akarma.

282
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:32,042
Like the sun: the sun shines, but the sun
doesn’t –

283
00:22:32,243 --> 00:22:35,350
is not conscious that it is shining,
it’s just emitting.

284
00:22:35,551 --> 00:22:38,309
It’s not bothered. It’s not conscious
of it.

285
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:44,510
It comes, it changes so many leaves into –
gives them colour, gives oxygen –

286
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:47,990
does all kinds of things and it goes back.
Least bothered.

287
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:53,325
It is just emitting. It does not require
any kind of a self-satisfaction

288
00:22:53,526 --> 00:22:56,385
that “I have done it, I am doing it.”

289
00:22:56,586 --> 00:23:01,506
That kind of a thing should happen to you
when you just become an akarma.

290
00:23:01,711 --> 00:23:06,229
That is what He was saying. This is
the karma theory of Shri Krishna.

291
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:11,038
But He said that a day will come when
you will get your realisation

292
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:15,426
and then this karma will be sucked in.

293
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:22,473
Christ is the embodiment of all that
Krishna prophesized or said,

294
00:23:22,674 --> 00:23:26,511
He came on this earth to prove it.

295
00:23:29,790 --> 00:23:35,269
The second thing that He talked about
is about the Bhakti Yoga,

296
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:38,949
that you must – you worship by your,
this side –

297
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:46,214
that you must worship God, that you must
surrender yourself to God.

298
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:51,984
Now, when we say that we pray to God,

299
00:23:52,185 --> 00:23:54,055
we ask for [from] Him – I mean, we ask
everything,

300
00:23:54,256 --> 00:23:57,950
I mean, the way we ask God all the time
really is something so horrible.

301
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:00,949
Like we’ll say that “Now I want to have
a divorce,

302
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,310
get cancer for my wife, or do this for…”
I mean, all sorts of things we ask for.

303
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,772
We say that “We are in the war, we should
win,

304
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:11,870
the enemy should be lost”, and all sorts
of things we ask for [from] God.

305
00:24:12,110 --> 00:24:15,390
I mean, God must be fed up the way we ask
things.

306
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:20,470
But whatever it is, to surrender
at the Lotus Feet of God,

307
00:24:20,671 --> 00:24:25,509
through your worship, Krishna has been
diplomatic again.

308
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:32,413
He said that “If you have to do Bhakti,
worship, it should be ananya, ananya.”

309
00:24:32,614 --> 00:24:35,785
Now, this word is the most diplomatic, and
He used it again and again

310
00:24:35,986 --> 00:24:40,069
with all these scholars and all these
people have missed it.

311
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:44,710
Ananya means when there is not the other,
when you are connected.

312
00:24:44,910 --> 00:24:49,749
You must do the surrendering when you
are connected, which is very true.

313
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:53,309
Without connection, if you start doing
any bhakti,

314
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,829
whom are you doing the bhakti?

315
00:24:56,030 --> 00:25:01,072
If there is no connection – supposing I’m
sitting in London, you are here.

316
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:03,933
You are writing letters after letters,
letters after letters,

317
00:25:04,134 --> 00:25:08,310
I never receive them, I never read them,
I’ve nothing to do with it.

318
00:25:08,511 --> 00:25:10,230
So what’s the use?

319
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,710
You must have some connection with God
Almighty:

320
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,029
then whatever bhakti you do it has
a meaning.

321
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,789
So before realisation, the bhakti has
no meaning.

322
00:25:20,990 --> 00:25:25,150
Like these mad people “Hare Rama Hare
Krishna, Hare Rama Hare Krishna” –

323
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:32,110
by saying these things if you can achieve
anything - then it is the easiest,

324
00:25:32,311 --> 00:25:35,389
but the one thing that you spoil is this
centre.

325
00:25:35,590 --> 00:25:39,870
You spoil the worst of all, and they always
get throat cancer.

326
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,350
The reason is, the first of all, you spoil
the centre;

327
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,750
you spoil the centre because you go on
saying,

328
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:49,070
“Hare Rama Hare Krishna” too many times.

329
00:25:49,270 --> 00:25:54,510
What is there to take God’s name like that?
It’s very, very cheap thing.

330
00:25:54,710 --> 00:25:58,069
If you are realised, you don’t have to take
God’s name like that.

331
00:25:58,270 --> 00:26:01,030
There’s a protocol of God: if you are
to take His name,

332
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,835
you have to take it properly, with
a protocol, even after realisation.

333
00:26:05,036 --> 00:26:06,593
But if you just go on saying, “Christ
Christ, Christ,

334
00:26:06,794 --> 00:26:09,611
Christ, Christ, Christ”, all the way –
Christ will be so angry with you.,

335
00:26:09,812 --> 00:26:11,938
What is it? Is He such a cheap thing?

336
00:26:12,139 --> 00:26:16,870
First of all you’ll spoil, the name, here,
by taking - I mean, mechanically,

337
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:21,910
I mean, physically you will spoil this
throat. I mean, when I also speak too much

338
00:26:22,110 --> 00:26:25,750
I have to get some sort of a soothing
thing for my throat.

339
00:26:25,950 --> 00:26:30,116
So you can imagine a person who is not
realised, who has no idea

340
00:26:30,317 --> 00:26:32,590
as to what name to be taken, he takes
that name all the time,

341
00:26:32,790 --> 00:26:35,069
the “mantras” so-called that are given
to you.

342
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:37,792
You get spoiled this [Central Vishuddhi],

343
00:26:37,993 --> 00:26:41,070
plus you spoil your - this mantra
[left Vishuddhi],

344
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:44,070
because this left side,

345
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:49,270
because you have taken the unauthorised
name of Shri Krishna.

346
00:26:49,470 --> 00:26:52,846
So you are in for a throat cancer.

347
00:26:53,047 --> 00:26:58,589
If you want to get it, you better join this
“Hare Rama Hare Krishna” cult.

348
00:26:58,790 --> 00:27:02,069
And they think they are very near Krishna.

349
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,109
How will they recognise Shri Krishna?

350
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:09,389
But this chakra is the best among others
for one reason:

351
00:27:09,590 --> 00:27:14,167
if this chakra is spoilt, say – smoking
spoils it a little bit.

352
00:27:14,368 --> 00:27:17,629
In the beginning if it is too much smoking
it spoils very badly.

353
00:27:17,830 --> 00:27:25,468
Then the, from the cervical plexus,
the nerves go down on both the sides.

354
00:27:25,669 --> 00:27:29,709
And the sensitivity in the hands is
so little,

355
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:34,749
that when you start feeling the vibrations,

356
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:43,789
you may feel a jet of air coming out
of your head, a great jet,

357
00:27:43,990 --> 00:27:47,030
but in the hands you may not feel anything
at all.

358
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:51,029
At all, there are many who just don’t feel
anything in the hands.

359
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:55,869
In the beginning they just don’t feel,
because their hands are not sensitive.

360
00:27:56,070 --> 00:28:01,429
They have done greatest harm to their
cervical plexus.

361
00:28:01,630 --> 00:28:05,149
And that’s why this chakra is stopped.

362
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:09,150
It doesn’t give you the sensitivity, though
the Kundalini has crossed through.

363
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:12,389
But gradually then Kundalini spreads
on the sides

364
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:17,789
and gives energy to this centre, which
passes through the system,

365
00:28:17,990 --> 00:28:22,822
and then you start feeling in the hands

366
00:28:23,023 --> 00:28:26,270
the all-pervading Power which is
the knowledge.

367
00:28:26,470 --> 00:28:30,670
Otherwise people don’t feel it, they may
feel it in the head but not in the hands.

368
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:34,589
I was really shocked when I came here
nine years back,

369
00:28:34,790 --> 00:28:40,349
that this country was nothing but
a chimney.

370
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:46,762
That time, everyone – whether it was
a woman, or a man, or a child –

371
00:28:46,963 --> 00:28:50,574
everyone used to smoke, and so much
of smoking

372
00:28:50,775 --> 00:28:57,029
that, really, I didn’t know how this
Vishuddhi, the America, is going to live.

373
00:28:57,230 --> 00:29:00,790
[Now, please pay attention here, all right?
Don’t turn round your heads. Now.]

374
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:06,346
Now, this centre should be used in such
a manner

375
00:29:06,547 --> 00:29:10,762
that you keep your collectivity.

376
00:29:10,963 --> 00:29:15,546
A person who is an individualist, who
keeps away from collective beings,

377
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:19,146
who does not give vibrations, sits at home
before my photograph,

378
00:29:19,347 --> 00:29:22,869
wants to take vibrations and all that -

379
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:29,590
such a person will not be able to progress
much in Sahaja Yoga.

380
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:35,869
This has an inlet and an outlet. Unless
and until you give, there is an outlet,

381
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:41,790
there will not be the inlet of vibrations.
With your hands you give to others.

382
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:46,429
Now, the fourth thing Krishna has said
is the Raja Yoga,

383
00:29:46,630 --> 00:29:55,269
in which you get Kundalini awakening
and you get all these chakras acting.

384
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:59,630
He has given actually the action into which
they move.

385
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:03,811
Like the bandhas take place, how these
chakras go

386
00:30:04,012 --> 00:30:09,630
and sort of catch hold of that part
of the Kundalini and hold it up.

387
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:12,789
And how these bandhas take place,
all He has described;

388
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,949
is the thing that happens when Kundalini
starts.

389
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,629
Like one can describe that when the car
starts,

390
00:30:20,830 --> 00:30:29,870
the car starts moving and the, all
the other small bolts and nuts,

391
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:33,628
and all of them are there, they also start
then moving one after another.

392
00:30:33,829 --> 00:30:38,510
The whole mechanism, the works, you can
say, starts manifesting itself.

393
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:42,550
In the same way, within us it starts
working, this is what He said.

394
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:47,943
But people are using it for Kriya Yoga
which is nonsense.

395
00:30:48,144 --> 00:30:52,549
Like you sit down, hold your stomach.
But the Kundalini has not started:

396
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:57,750
why are you holding your stomach, and hold
your nose, then you hold these ears?

397
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:00,254
What is the use? The Kundalini has not
yet started:

398
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:04,670
why are you doing all this nonsense? You
see, there is this here your Yogananda,

399
00:31:04,870 --> 00:31:07,851
who has taught this nonsense to you
of Kriya Yog.

400
00:31:08,052 --> 00:31:13,076
I mean, horrible it is. The amount
of diseases one can get from this...

401
00:31:13,277 --> 00:31:17,550
I mean, unnecessarily you shave your head.
Why to shave your head?

402
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:20,180
By shaving your head are you going to go
to God?

403
00:31:20,381 --> 00:31:22,247
Then why has He given you hair?

404
00:31:22,448 --> 00:31:26,136
They shave their head – nonsense it is,
absolutely, to shave your head.

405
00:31:26,337 --> 00:31:29,698
The sheep is shaved every week - every
year twice:

406
00:31:29,899 --> 00:31:32,870
and by shaving your head, you are not
going to go to God.

407
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:36,519
These all nonsensical ideas to shave your
head, to wear a funny dress,

408
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,318
walk seriously like this, and you’ll go
to God?

409
00:31:40,526 --> 00:31:42,919
One must understand that the happening
has to take place

410
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,553
of Kundalini awakening has to take place
itself,

411
00:31:45,754 --> 00:31:48,722
is a spontaneous, is a living thing.

412
00:31:48,923 --> 00:31:54,789
By doing all these artificial things you
are spoiling yourself completely.

413
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,843
It automatically happens.

414
00:31:57,044 --> 00:31:59,550
But all this mechanism, you don’t have
to worry,

415
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,709
because once the Kundalini rises,
it happens.

416
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:06,364
What is actually, I now feel that Krishna
never knew

417
00:32:06,565 --> 00:32:08,590
that human beings will be so mad.

418
00:32:08,790 --> 00:32:12,150
For example supposing, if your car has
not started,

419
00:32:12,350 --> 00:32:17,338
do you start moving its machinery by hand?

420
00:32:17,750 --> 00:32:20,310
And believe that the car has started
moving?

421
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:23,629
It’s the most absurd thing to do to spoil
the car.

422
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:28,710
And that’s what exactly you do, when
you try to do this Kriya Yoga.

423
00:32:28,910 --> 00:32:31,789
There is a-kriya, you don’t have to do
any action.

424
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:36,069
The action takes place by itself, it is
built-in. It is within you.

425
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:41,749
I will give you another example, supposing
there’s a seed, and you want to sprout it.

426
00:32:41,950 --> 00:32:45,345
Will you try to pull the primule out of it?

427
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:48,733
Will it sprout? It’s that senseless,
I tell you,

428
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:52,498
the way people try to do all these tricks,
standing on their head and…

429
00:32:52,699 --> 00:32:56,413
God has given us legs to stand, not
the head to stand.

430
00:32:56,614 --> 00:32:59,709
I don’t know from where this idea has
come that you stand on your head.

431
00:32:59,910 --> 00:33:03,679
By that Kundalini is never awakened.
It is for a certain disease,

432
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:07,984
that that head standing is good, but not
for everyone.

433
00:33:08,185 --> 00:33:10,150
It’s for a cure of a disease, that’s all.

434
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:13,270
All sorts of funny ideas, even people
drink urine!

435
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:16,350
I mean, all sorts of things they do,
nonsensical things, you know,

436
00:33:16,551 --> 00:33:18,550
to get to realisation.

437
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:22,169
There was one lady of Neem Karoli Baba,
he’s another horrible fellow.

438
00:33:22,370 --> 00:33:24,829
and she came to Me, she was like this,
like this, like this.

439
00:33:25,030 --> 00:33:28,546
I told her, “What did you do there?
What did you do with this man?”

440
00:33:28,747 --> 00:33:31,390
“Oooh Mother, he blessed me specially.”
I said, “What?”

441
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,830
“He gave me his water.” I said, “His water?
What is his water is this?”

442
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:39,870
And this is the water she drank, for days
together, for years together,

443
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:44,065
and now she says, “I can’t forget him!”

444
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:48,049
Imagine, to bring God to that level!

445
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:53,962
I mean, can there be a greater blasphemy
and ridiculous way

446
00:33:54,163 --> 00:33:58,910
of treating God Almighty who has created
you? There’s no respect!

447
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:01,971
No respect! You don’t respect yourself;

448
00:34:02,172 --> 00:34:05,390
you don’t respect your chastity, you don’t
respect your private parts.

449
00:34:05,591 --> 00:34:08,629
How can you respect God?

450
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:12,629
This is what it is, and they teach you
not to respect.

451
00:34:12,830 --> 00:34:16,099
And this is what happens when you start
reading Gita –

452
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:20,251
you see, they are all blind people, blind
people can’t read Gita.

453
00:34:20,452 --> 00:34:23,150
Blind people cannot read Bible: they'll
never understand,

454
00:34:23,350 --> 00:34:25,776
they will never understand the inner
meaning of it

455
00:34:25,977 --> 00:34:29,792
and they’ll just twist it for their own
purpose.

456
00:34:29,993 --> 00:34:33,352
Now the left-hand side is the one that
gives you,

457
00:34:33,553 --> 00:34:39,150
what you call, the guilt feeling. I don’t
know whom to blame now.

458
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:44,269
For example, say, the churches,
the Catholic churches.

459
00:34:44,470 --> 00:34:48,549
I mean, when did Christ say that you are
guilty?

460
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,723
From where did they pick up this? I
cannot say from where they picked it up.

461
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:55,323
Christ could never have said that you are
guilty,

462
00:34:55,524 --> 00:34:58,189
that you should feel guilty, that you
should suffer.

463
00:34:58,390 --> 00:35:01,090
I mean, from childhood if you tell
somebody that “You are guilty”,

464
00:35:01,291 --> 00:35:04,590
he’ll become automatically, it’s
a conditioning on the person.

465
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:08,452
He will devise methods to find out that
what guilt he has.

466
00:35:08,653 --> 00:35:12,456
After all, you are a human being, and you
can make mistakes.

467
00:35:12,657 --> 00:35:15,126
And you are blind, God knows that!

468
00:35:15,327 --> 00:35:20,549
And He also knows that all your mistakes
are to be forgiven.

469
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:25,110
They are to be forgiven, and you are
to be given realisation.

470
00:35:25,310 --> 00:35:28,549
He is worried about His own creation,
isn’t He?

471
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:32,509
Is He going to waste you only because you
have committed some mistakes here and there?

472
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,909
And what mistakes can you commit?
That also let’s see.

473
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:45,406
He is the ocean of love. He is the ocean
of compassion.

474
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:50,743
He is the ocean of forgiveness.

475
00:35:50,944 --> 00:35:54,629
He is ocean, and you are a drop
in the ocean.

476
00:35:54,830 --> 00:35:58,870
And how much a drop can carry a dirt
that He cannot cleanse?

477
00:35:59,070 --> 00:36:03,472
Think of it. Think of it when you say
you are guilty.

478
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:05,959
This is a fashion that is developed here,

479
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,471
and sometimes I find this guilt is nothing
but this Mr. Ego coils up into it

480
00:36:10,672 --> 00:36:14,421
and says, “All right, I’m guilty,
finished.”

481
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:19,910
It is not facing the fact.

482
00:36:20,886 --> 00:36:23,692
Supposing you have done the mistake,
what’s the use of saying,

483
00:36:23,893 --> 00:36:26,949
“I have done the mistake, I have done
the mistake, I have done the mistake”?

484
00:36:27,150 --> 00:36:30,523
Do you correct it? Do you correct it
by that,

485
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:32,839
saying that “I have done the mistake,
now I’ve done the mistake”?

486
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,274
It would be something, say, we got lost
in the car,

487
00:36:36,475 --> 00:36:40,150
and we went into another road. Now
we sit down there crying,

488
00:36:40,350 --> 00:36:42,015
“Oh, we have made the mistake, better
sit down.”

489
00:36:42,216 --> 00:36:45,069
Here people are waiting for me, all right,
for the programme,

490
00:36:45,270 --> 00:36:47,442
and I am sitting down there crying,
“We have done the mistake,

491
00:36:47,643 --> 00:36:50,602
we have come to the wrong line, we
should not have been here.”

492
00:36:50,803 --> 00:36:55,509
If I have done the mistake, correct it
and come back to the right position!

493
00:36:55,710 --> 00:36:57,389
Go on correcting it!

494
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,588
Instead of that, this is the best way
of sitting down saying,

495
00:36:59,789 --> 00:37:02,017
“We have done the mistake, I should
not have done this,

496
00:37:02,218 --> 00:37:04,642
I should not have done this.” Putting
down yourself,

497
00:37:04,843 --> 00:37:10,789
“I can’t do it” – to be diffident all
the time – “Oh, I just can’t do it.”

498
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,380
This could be very dangerous, very
dangerous.

499
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:18,988
For example, supposing in an accident
you have harmed somebody.

500
00:37:19,189 --> 00:37:22,136
Now you sit down there, “Oh I have done
the mistake, I’ve committed the mistake.”

501
00:37:22,337 --> 00:37:25,270
Oh please, get hold up of that person whom
you have harmed,

502
00:37:25,471 --> 00:37:29,699
take him to the hospital, get him treated!

503
00:37:30,837 --> 00:37:34,269
This is the way we do not face by feeling
guilty.

504
00:37:34,470 --> 00:37:39,509
It’s a very good way of Mr. Ego to coil up
into the left Vishuddhi

505
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:45,510
and say, “Oh, you are guilty.” Who are
you to judge yourself?

506
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:48,989
Why do you judge yourself? How do you
judge yourself?

507
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:51,526
You have no method of judging yourself.

508
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:56,549
All the time you find out ways and methods
of feeling diffident in life.

509
00:37:56,750 --> 00:38:00,030
And such diffident people, what are they
going to do?

510
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:03,230
You have to take swords in your hand
of honesty

511
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,070
and of dedication to God’s work.

512
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:10,069
There they are standing with the sword
like this [shaking].

513
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:15,325
They can’t even handle a little stick in
their hand, what are they going to do?

514
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:20,270
Because they are all very guilty people,
all the time shaking.

515
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,330
Why to feel guilty, by making yourself
so diffident

516
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:29,309
and useless warrior of God’s work?

517
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:32,092
This guilt is the worst thing, and in
Sahaja Yoga,

518
00:38:32,293 --> 00:38:38,541
the first mantra always I ask to say,
“I am not guilty.”

519
00:38:39,831 --> 00:38:43,158
You don’t judge yourself like that. You
have no business to condemn yourself.

520
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:47,327
God has created you with such difficulties,
now understand it.

521
00:38:47,528 --> 00:38:49,910
You are above everything that is
[Indistinct],

522
00:38:50,110 --> 00:38:52,430
much above these things, much above
all these flowers,

523
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,509
much above all the stars, all the sky
that is created.

524
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:01,070
And here you are, like fools you are
feeling guilty and sitting down at home

525
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:04,509
and spoiling the work of God!

526
00:39:04,710 --> 00:39:08,580
You have to get to your realisation, you
have to get to your absolute,

527
00:39:08,781 --> 00:39:11,510
you have to get to your own being!

528
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:16,910
And become what you are, and not to waste
all the work that He has done here.

529
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:22,589
How He must be feeling! How much He has
done for you, to become this!

530
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:28,869
And here you are, on a small thing you just
slip out, and spoil the complete work.

531
00:39:29,070 --> 00:39:34,429
Is this the way to behave towards your
Father? And towards your Mother?

532
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:41,910
And towards Christ, their son? Is this
the way to treat?

533
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:45,109
We have to stand up with courage,
with fearlessness.

534
00:39:45,310 --> 00:39:49,709
This gives you fear, unnecessary
botheration, and worries

535
00:39:49,910 --> 00:39:54,841
and you start thinking about things which
do not exist, all imaginary.

536
00:39:55,042 --> 00:39:57,950
Left Vishuddhi is a curse of modern times.

537
00:39:58,150 --> 00:40:02,669
And I would request you all to come out
of it.

538
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:07,293
Every morning you tell yourself that
“I’m not guilty!”

539
00:40:07,494 --> 00:40:10,789
You must say it thrice in the morning
and thrice in the evening.

540
00:40:10,990 --> 00:40:14,826
What is there to feel guilty about?

541
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:21,998
I wish Christ had included this
in the prayer.

542
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:25,189
But you have to forgive yourself,
first of all.

543
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:28,419
I mean, He could never have imagined that
humans – human beings –

544
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:36,762
would be so stupid as to all the time say
that “I am guilty, I can’t forgive myself.”

545
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:39,869
Human beings have escapes for everything.

546
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:45,069
Now this is a new modern method they have
devised of running away from reality.

547
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:51,182
Reality is to be faced, and to be enjoyed.

548
00:40:52,677 --> 00:40:59,229
It is called as veeraja, is the one that
has to permeate into, joy.

549
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:07,016
You come and sit on the throne
and enjoy.

550
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:13,459
Today my Vishuddhi is out – now see.

551
00:41:20,595 --> 00:41:25,621
Now, I have been able to tell you in short
about Vishuddhi chakra.

552
00:41:25,822 --> 00:41:31,978
Let’s go to the another chakra here which
is called as the Agnya chakra.

553
00:41:32,179 --> 00:41:38,669
Agnya chakra resides in the centre
of optic chiasma.

554
00:41:38,870 --> 00:41:43,909
Optic chiasma is the one which crosses
each other,

555
00:41:44,110 --> 00:41:52,650
and in the centre of it is the special
centre called as Agnya chakra.

556
00:41:52,851 --> 00:42:05,589
Is a very subtle centre, and this centre
is adorned by our Lord Jesus Christ.

557
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:10,972
He is the son of Mahalakshmi.

558
00:42:11,173 --> 00:42:15,349
Is the son of the entire Power that resides
here.

559
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:18,949
Is the Mahalakshmi, the Viratangana,
the wife of Virata,

560
00:42:19,150 --> 00:42:23,189
the power of the Primordial.

561
00:42:23,397 --> 00:42:27,341
He is the son created by Her and is very
well described

562
00:42:27,542 --> 00:42:30,294
in the Devi Purana and other books,

563
00:42:30,495 --> 00:42:36,188
which are not yet translated, I think,
in English, as Mahavishnu.

564
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:41,137
He is called as Mahavishnu, so the Vishnu’s
greater form;

565
00:42:41,338 --> 00:42:46,289
but He is the son of Vishnu, He is the son
of Shri Krishna.

566
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:53,109
Shri Krishna had described Him as
somebody who is the Adhara,

567
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:56,257
is the support of the whole universe.

568
00:42:56,458 --> 00:43:00,389
He has given him a higher position
than Himself, see.

569
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:04,150
And He said, “This One, when He will be
coming on this earth,

570
00:43:04,350 --> 00:43:06,989
He will prove all that I have said.

571
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:12,211
He’ll prove because He will be the essence,
He will be the Omkara,

572
00:43:12,412 --> 00:43:18,097
He will be the all-pervading power, He’ll
walk on the water.

573
00:43:18,298 --> 00:43:21,710
Not only, but He’ll be resurrected, His
body will be resurrected.”

574
00:43:21,910 --> 00:43:25,251
He has described Him fully there, and He
has given Him

575
00:43:25,452 --> 00:43:30,754
the highest position that He is the Adhar,
 He is the support,

576
00:43:30,955 --> 00:43:36,068
because He lives there at the Muladhara
also, at the support of the root.

577
00:43:36,269 --> 00:43:41,030
And He resides – actually, He is the vice-
chancellor of this university, we can say,

578
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:46,389
that at every point we have to have Him
to certify.

579
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:53,189
If He is not there, you cannot, you cannot
awaken the Kundalini,

580
00:43:53,390 --> 00:43:58,709
if you don’t believe in Him you cannot
retain your realisation.

581
00:43:58,910 --> 00:44:02,780
Yesterday, a lady asked me, “Can we not
do it without Christ?”

582
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:05,831
I said, “I’m sorry.” Without Christ –

583
00:44:06,032 --> 00:44:12,917
because He is all-pervading, He is the
Omkara, He is the One who is the power,

584
00:44:13,118 --> 00:44:16,923
He is the One who is flowing in us,
He is the Spirit.

585
00:44:17,124 --> 00:44:20,700
Now, if you are seeking the Spirit, how
can you do it without it?

586
00:44:20,901 --> 00:44:23,669
It’s an absurd question.

587
00:44:23,870 --> 00:44:29,269
It is He came on this point [Agnya], and
this being a narrow path,

588
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:33,709
He had to pass through it to prove what
Krishna had said,

589
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:38,429
that it cannot be killed, He got Himself
crucified.

590
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:44,450
It was a drama played by Him. His Mother
was the Holy Ghost,

591
00:44:44,651 --> 00:44:48,510
was the part that is the Mahalakshmi, but
He didn’t say a word about Her.

592
00:44:48,711 --> 00:44:53,222
He didn’t say, because if He had said it,

593
00:44:53,423 --> 00:44:56,813
people would have put their attention
to Her,

594
00:44:57,014 --> 00:45:01,750
and He is bestowed with eleven powers
of destruction.

595
00:45:01,950 --> 00:45:03,389
He is such a powerful person.

596
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:08,710
You may show Him as a lanky-panky fellow
because that satisfies your sadism,

597
00:45:08,910 --> 00:45:11,750
you want to see Christ like that – He was
not like that.

598
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:15,949
He was, He is only painted by, I think,
Rubens very well,

599
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:19,109
but the best is that in the Sistine Chapel,

600
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:24,629
where Michelangelo has really boldly
painted Him the way He was.

601
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,023
He was a tall – not very tall, quite tall –

602
00:45:28,224 --> 00:45:31,749
and a very healthy and a hefty person
with a big stomach.

603
00:45:31,950 --> 00:45:34,109
He is known as Lambodara, with a big
stomach.

604
00:45:34,310 --> 00:45:41,149
And He could carry such a huge, big cross
on His back.

605
00:45:41,350 --> 00:45:45,253
So people when they showed Him, I mean,
then I was amazed at it,

606
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:48,034
how could they show Christ in such
a miserable state,

607
00:45:48,235 --> 00:45:51,989
how could they do it, I mean, horrible
it is!

608
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,680
This is just their own expression, that’s
how they wanted Him to be,

609
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:59,014
these are the people who must have
definitely crucified Christ.

610
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:02,749
Because they liked to see Him so miserable
and unhappy.

611
00:46:02,950 --> 00:46:06,429
How can a person who is a realised soul
be that way?

612
00:46:06,630 --> 00:46:13,270
He has to be a cheerful person, fiery,
dynamic! It has to be a healthy person!

613
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:16,870
A miserable person supposing before you
stands and talks like this –

614
00:46:17,070 --> 00:46:18,996
are you going to believe that person?

615
00:46:19,197 --> 00:46:22,612
But this is the way they have treated
Christ throughout – they have maligned Him,

616
00:46:22,813 --> 00:46:27,390
and they have treated Him, they have –
He has been crucified so many times.

617
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:32,916
I find it impossible to believe that how
these people are reborn

618
00:46:33,117 --> 00:46:37,989
who crucified Him again! And again and
again they are crucifying Him.

619
00:46:38,190 --> 00:46:43,469
The crucifixion is not the message
of Christ.

620
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:49,069
That’s why I also don’t like people to wear
the cross, I can’t see the cross.

621
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:52,349
It’s not! Cross, of course, is very
helpful,

622
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:57,466
because if the bad spirits see the cross
they run away.

623
00:46:57,667 --> 00:47:01,843
But it is a reminder of something which
was unbearable.

624
00:47:02,044 --> 00:47:05,389
Because the Mother had all the power,
She was Mahalakshmi.

625
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,549
He had eleven powers, eleven powers
to destroy.

626
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,829
You can imagine, He has still those powers.

627
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:17,734
And He had to go through all that without
destruction.

628
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,174
He saw through it.

629
00:47:21,375 --> 00:47:25,430
Now, people may say, “How was He
resurrected?”

630
00:47:25,630 --> 00:47:29,509
First of all, they have an objection
to Immaculate Conception.

631
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:34,069
I mean, they have objection for everything.
He was not a human being.

632
00:47:34,270 --> 00:47:40,110
He was the Divine Power! I conceived you
in my heart.

633
00:47:40,750 --> 00:47:43,597
Do you know that? And I put my Kundalini

634
00:47:43,798 --> 00:47:50,109
and I put you on my - from my heart into it
and I take you out from here (Sahasrara).

635
00:47:50,310 --> 00:47:52,390
The way you have got your second birth,

636
00:47:52,590 --> 00:47:56,543
in the same way, Christ got His
immaculate birth.

637
00:47:56,744 --> 00:48:04,229
She put Him in the heart and into the
uterus down below and She created Him.

638
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:09,990
It’s very easy to doubt Him and say things
against Him because He is no more.

639
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:12,453
And the Jews must learn a lesson now.

640
00:48:12,654 --> 00:48:14,670
They denied Him once and they have
suffered.

641
00:48:14,870 --> 00:48:17,399
Now, don’t deny Him again.

642
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:24,949
You cannot deny the person, the embodiment
of this Divine Power.

643
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:27,949
Christians may be blown off, if Christians
have tortured you,

644
00:48:28,150 --> 00:48:31,749
forget them, they are just the same as
you are - fanatics, fanatics, fanatics.

645
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:34,818
Whether they are Christians or they are
Muslims -

646
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:37,150
Khomeini is the same as any other person.

647
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:44,030
 I do not find any difference whatsoever.
Dogmatic, ignorant, fanatic.

648
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,954
Forget these people, they do not stand
for Christ.

649
00:48:47,155 --> 00:48:51,270
Christ Himself has said in second chapter
of Matthews, II verse,

650
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:57,226
“You’ll be calling Me, ‘Christ, Christ, I
won’t recognise you.’ Who are these?”

651
00:48:57,427 --> 00:49:02,189
The people who say, “Christ - we are
the solicitors of Christ.

652
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:06,509
We are the people who are in charge
of Christ.”

653
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:12,412
All of these people will be charged, and
they will be thrown away in the hell

654
00:49:12,613 --> 00:49:15,990
the way they have managed things about
Christ.

655
00:49:16,190 --> 00:49:19,544
Some of them are genuine - they don’t know
that this is artificial,

656
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:23,509
they are genuinely in it, but they must
get their realisation.

657
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:28,269
They must ask for their real realisation

658
00:49:28,470 --> 00:49:31,656
and they must know what is Christ within
themselves,

659
00:49:31,857 --> 00:49:35,609
they have to awaken this Christ here.

660
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:45,390
Now, as I was telling you that Christ said
that “You are to be born again”,

661
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:48,671
that “I’m to be born in your heart.”

662
00:49:48,872 --> 00:49:52,523
Now, the heart centre is here as well
as here

663
00:49:52,724 --> 00:49:56,989
because the heart is controlled by this
centre at the fontanel bone area.

664
00:49:57,190 --> 00:50:00,110
And that’s what He said that “You should
get your realisation”,

665
00:50:00,310 --> 00:50:02,830
when He said, “You should be put
in the heart.”

666
00:50:03,030 --> 00:50:09,429
Now, the people of various countries, even
your country, went down to India.

667
00:50:09,630 --> 00:50:13,782
And they never told that Christ was born
who was the Mahavishnu.

668
00:50:13,983 --> 00:50:18,400
Because He is already described in
the Puranas that He is the Adhara -

669
00:50:18,601 --> 00:50:21,413
He is the One who will be - once awakened
in the Kundalini,

670
00:50:21,614 --> 00:50:24,590
by the Kundalini – will suck your karmas.

671
00:50:24,790 --> 00:50:28,222
They never went and told, so the Indians
went on with their karma-theory,

672
00:50:28,446 --> 00:50:31,469
and these gurus have come here to teach
you karma.

673
00:50:31,670 --> 00:50:35,350
It is amazing how you accept all these
theories of nonsense.

674
00:50:35,550 --> 00:50:40,589
Like they’ll say that “You have to suffer,
because you have done bad karmas.”

675
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,159
Then they may say that “Yes, you can
give you a balance,

676
00:50:43,360 --> 00:50:46,637
but you go this way or that way and you
just keep into balance”.

677
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:50,094
If that is so - that you have to go to one
extreme and to another extreme -

678
00:50:50,295 --> 00:50:53,223
then what are they doing here? Why are
they talking?

679
00:50:53,424 --> 00:50:56,973
They too should shut up, because they
cannot do anything.

680
00:50:57,174 --> 00:51:00,830
They cannot give you realisation. They
cannot save you from this situation.

681
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:07,110
So, it’s better that you suffer. But why do
they say you should suffer?

682
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:12,695
Why should they say? Because they want
to enjoy your sufferings.

683
00:51:12,896 --> 00:51:16,309
They want you to suffer because they
enjoy it.

684
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:20,390
So many of these disciples who came
from these horrible gurus,

685
00:51:20,590 --> 00:51:23,755
who said, “You must have your karmas
and you must suffer”,

686
00:51:23,956 --> 00:51:30,709
told me that they saw their gurus giggling
at them and mocking at them.

687
00:51:30,910 --> 00:51:34,110
And they showed me some of the photographs
they had taken of these gurus,

688
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:39,129
which show complete mockery of these
stupid disciples who were suffering

689
00:51:39,330 --> 00:51:43,869
in their body and suffering in their mind,
in the presence of these gurus.

690
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:48,430
So they have a double enjoyment - one
the money, another is the sadism,

691
00:51:48,630 --> 00:51:53,867
and third, the greatest of all, that their
purpose is to kill you all

692
00:51:54,068 --> 00:51:57,402
and to destroy you all, because you are
God’s men.

693
00:51:57,603 --> 00:52:02,121
That they achieve by their falsehood,

694
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:04,710
because you are impressed by their
falsehood.

695
00:52:04,910 --> 00:52:07,829
Now, see, if there was any false guru here
this hall would be filled,

696
00:52:08,030 --> 00:52:12,507
the whole thing would be filled,
on the road there would be a jam.

697
00:52:12,951 --> 00:52:17,949
But the real guru - I have seen not only
here - everywhere it starts very slowly.

698
00:52:18,150 --> 00:52:20,950
Of course, in a place where people are
very simple

699
00:52:21,150 --> 00:52:23,826
and who are very sensitive it’s a different
point.

700
00:52:24,027 --> 00:52:29,452
But the people in a city specially, they
are so insensitive to reality

701
00:52:29,653 --> 00:52:35,211
and so sensitive to devils that it is
surprising, they feel very much at home

702
00:52:35,412 --> 00:52:39,947
with the devils and very much lost with
the reality.

703
00:52:40,148 --> 00:52:43,509
Because you are in falsehood!

704
00:52:43,710 --> 00:52:46,910
So you must know that you have to become
the real.

705
00:52:47,110 --> 00:52:51,549
You have to become that which is
the Spirit, which is not so far,

706
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:58,669
is shining in your central nervous system,
in your awareness.

707
00:52:58,870 --> 00:53:03,456
And this is the Spirit, is the One,
is Christ.

708
00:53:03,657 --> 00:53:07,498
I’ve spoken before also in the churches,
but today for the first time

709
00:53:07,699 --> 00:53:11,925
I am speaking about Christ in a church.
And that’s why I was very happy

710
00:53:12,126 --> 00:53:16,478
that at least in this church I would say
something that could establish Him,

711
00:53:16,679 --> 00:53:20,749
and that when people will come here,
I hope they get their realisation

712
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,989
and that something works out here, they
get at least the awakening,

713
00:53:24,190 --> 00:53:26,540
because so many saints are sitting in front
of me.

714
00:53:26,741 --> 00:53:29,637
Maybe that one day will come in this
church, maybe,

715
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:34,847
it may work out that people will get their
realisation.

716
00:53:35,613 --> 00:53:40,110
Christ’s life was only for three, four
years.

717
00:53:40,310 --> 00:53:45,149
Nobody allowed Him to live longer than
that.

718
00:53:45,350 --> 00:53:49,590
Whatever was possible was done, but
such stupid people,

719
00:53:49,790 --> 00:53:53,149
such stupid people, you could not talk
to them.

720
00:53:53,350 --> 00:53:57,030
And that’s how they killed Him.

721
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:02,947
He could not speak to them anymore and
that’s how His life was finished.

722
00:54:03,148 --> 00:54:07,117
But in that small life of His - what
a spark it was!

723
00:54:07,318 --> 00:54:10,349
What a spark it was!

724
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:15,510
The way people have behaved towards Him
is atrocious, I must say.

725
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:20,611
I must say the apostles themselves, because
this Matthews and this -

726
00:54:20,812 --> 00:54:23,390
he was such an intellectual, such
an intellectual -

727
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:26,229
he would not accept the idea of Immaculate
Conception.

728
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,731
Very difficult man - he would argue it out.

729
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:32,726
He said, “If a virgin is going to give the
child then everybody is going to say

730
00:54:32,927 --> 00:54:35,260
that it’s a very, very blasphemous thing,

731
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:40,526
it’s a very, very illegitimate thing and
it should not be spoken of.”

732
00:54:40,727 --> 00:54:43,109
Horrible fellow and one better than
the other.

733
00:54:43,310 --> 00:54:47,469
And when they took up about the spreading
of Christianity,

734
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:51,589
they took it in such a funny way, because
they became supra-conscious before that.

735
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:54,628
They started speaking the languages
of so many people.

736
00:54:54,829 --> 00:55:00,450
That part of Bible is wrong where they
became not realised.

737
00:55:00,651 --> 00:55:05,270
The wind part is all right, but so many
people I’ve seen who come to my program,

738
00:55:05,470 --> 00:55:09,445
when they come for realisation, they feel
the wind for a while

739
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:13,669
and immediately they shunt off and become
supra-conscious.

740
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,550
Now, we’ll see what is supra-conscious
entry and the subconscious entry.

741
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:23,147
Now you see here there are two buds.

742
00:55:23,348 --> 00:55:25,303
These are the two petals.

743
00:55:25,504 --> 00:55:31,870
One controls, of course, the pituitary,
that controls the ego,

744
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:38,078
and the pineal, that controls the superego.

745
00:55:38,279 --> 00:55:42,629
But this also has a capacity to bloat this
out this way,

746
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,269
and bloat this out this way.

747
00:55:45,470 --> 00:55:51,830
Supposing you become supra-conscious:
for start, you start thinking too much,

748
00:55:52,069 --> 00:55:55,749
about - something about the future, what
must be the galaxy,

749
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:59,636
we should find out about it and you must
find out about the stars

750
00:55:59,837 --> 00:56:02,671
and about all these things and about
future, about -

751
00:56:02,872 --> 00:56:09,311
say – prophecies, what else is that is,
astrology, and all these,

752
00:56:09,512 --> 00:56:12,590
you see, futuristic. You people are mostly
futuristic,

753
00:56:12,790 --> 00:56:15,856
you try to plan, you try to do - and every
plan fails, of course.

754
00:56:16,057 --> 00:56:21,869
But this thinking of planning of too much
can push this up this side, too much.

755
00:56:22,070 --> 00:56:25,644
Actually, as shown here is this side,
but actually,

756
00:56:25,845 --> 00:56:28,583
when it is placed, it is placed like this.

757
00:56:28,784 --> 00:56:32,269
The ego is placed like this and
the superego is like this.

758
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:33,905
Here we could not show the three
dimensions.

759
00:56:34,106 --> 00:56:37,910
So, from the back to this side
is the superego,

760
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:40,589
and from here to here is the ego.

761
00:56:40,790 --> 00:56:45,229
Now, this ego bloats out this way -
into this side.

762
00:56:45,430 --> 00:56:49,653
And when it bloats out this side it goes
into the supra-conscious area.

763
00:56:49,854 --> 00:56:53,333
So it comes up this side. Now,
the supra-conscious area

764
00:56:53,534 --> 00:56:58,444
gives you visions, hallucinations. LSD does
that, LSD does that.

765
00:56:58,645 --> 00:57:03,502
Then you start seeing some eye of a person,
who is a dead person,

766
00:57:03,703 --> 00:57:09,789
but a very ambitious person, for example
you might get the vision of Hitler.

767
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:17,149
You might get the vision of, say, all these
horrible kings who ruled here.

768
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:21,910
You might get, you see, colours. You may
see auras.

769
00:57:22,110 --> 00:57:25,878
And one has to understand here that
these auras start coming to us,

770
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:32,748
because we shift, we disintegrate from
our being.

771
00:57:32,949 --> 00:57:36,610
That’s how we start seeing something else
separated from us.

772
00:57:36,811 --> 00:57:40,629
To see auras is not a good sign in Sahaja
Yoga.

773
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:44,723
If you are seeing auras, we have to bring
you back to the same position,

774
00:57:44,924 --> 00:57:48,209
because you have to be in the present
and not in the future.

775
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:49,878
You get disintegrated.

776
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,235
For example, if there’s a machine, say,
which takes the auras - auras,

777
00:57:55,436 --> 00:58:00,523
I was talking to someone, who has done
that work of aura-picturing.

778
00:58:00,724 --> 00:58:04,909
Now, before - after realisation you don’t
get any auras in a person,

779
00:58:05,110 --> 00:58:09,788
cannot get any auras in a person, because
he is integrated, completely integrated.

780
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:14,389
But when he is in a mess, you start
getting the auras.

781
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:19,046
Like if he has cancer you’ll get auras,
if he is an alcoholic you’ll get auras,

782
00:58:19,247 --> 00:58:24,453
the kind with crazy auras, a normal person
may have auras not so much crazy.

783
00:58:24,654 --> 00:58:29,499
But auras you cannot feel when the whole
thing is integrated.

784
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:33,678
You can see in a, say, light;

785
00:58:33,879 --> 00:58:37,270
if there is no aberration that means
it’s a good light.

786
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:40,070
If there is aberration, then it’s a bad
light.

787
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:47,978
All the seven colours of a light has to be
concentrated and has to be integrated.

788
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:51,429
If they are prismatic and if they are
giving you separately,

789
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:54,389
then it is not one integration.

790
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:59,030
And when it is one integration, then
you cannot see seven lights.

791
00:58:59,231 --> 00:59:03,050
So the person is not integrated. Now,
all these auras come to us,

792
00:59:03,251 --> 00:59:09,190
because we are made of seven type
of cocoons within us.

793
00:59:09,391 --> 00:59:14,404
But the people who are on the right side
only believe in the five cocoons,

794
00:59:14,605 --> 00:59:18,256
they call them koshas. I don’t think
if I have time for that,

795
00:59:18,457 --> 00:59:25,706
but these are the koshas have been created
by - one is created by the first centre,

796
00:59:25,907 --> 00:59:30,754
by the second centre, by the third centre -
this is how the physical goes - thing.

797
00:59:30,955 --> 00:59:35,790
By the fourth one, then the fifth one.
And the sixth and the seventh

798
00:59:35,990 --> 00:59:40,029
are the things that they do not create
auras outside -

799
00:59:40,230 --> 00:59:45,985
they create inside near the heart. And
these are created near the heart,

800
00:59:46,186 --> 00:59:49,709
but as soon as you get your realisation,
they all become one.

801
00:59:49,910 --> 00:59:54,749
 They all merge into one and that is
the Spirit.

802
00:59:54,950 --> 00:59:59,549
So, as if you can say when the Spirit
exists in a prismatic state,

803
00:59:59,750 --> 01:00:04,909
then you get the auras of seven, but
when it becomes integrated

804
01:00:05,110 --> 01:00:10,804
that you become one, all the auras become
one.

805
01:00:11,005 --> 01:00:16,296
So, integration is the aim of Sahaja Yoga
and now, I think, I have told you

806
01:00:16,497 --> 01:00:20,709
how you can also go to the sub-conscious
area, the same way.

807
01:00:20,910 --> 01:00:23,589
The sub-conscious area is on the left-hand
side.

808
01:00:23,790 --> 01:00:26,710
If you move into collective sub-conscious
area, say for example,

809
01:00:26,910 --> 01:00:29,149
you can be triggered into cancer.

810
01:00:29,350 --> 01:00:33,045
By this triggering you might get heart
attacks and things like that, diabetes.

811
01:00:33,246 --> 01:00:36,629
Now, many people believe sugar gives
you diabetes - is nonsense.

812
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:39,309
Sugar doesn’t give you diabetes.

813
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:42,509
What gives the diabetes is too much
thinking.

814
01:00:42,710 --> 01:00:44,429
Those who do not think too much never get.

815
01:00:44,630 --> 01:00:48,271
Indian farmers never get diabetes - they
don’t know what disease this is.

816
01:00:48,472 --> 01:00:53,397
Because you think too much, you work too
much, this centre works too much.

817
01:00:53,598 --> 01:01:00,589
It has to create food for the brain, it has
to replace the brain centres.

818
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:07,189
And these brain centres are to be replaced.
For that it creates out of fat

819
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:12,575
the new centres, the evolved cells, like
I said here.

820
01:01:12,776 --> 01:01:17,549
And because of that work, if it is too
much, it neglects the other things

821
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:21,790
which it has to work out throughout, one
of them is the spleen, another is pancreas.

822
01:01:21,990 --> 01:01:26,362
And when it neglects the pancreas
you get diabetes.

823
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:32,667
Not by sugar. Of course, sugar because
it has to convert it into fat.

824
01:01:32,868 --> 01:01:36,315
But if you do not have sugar then it’s
a double work.

825
01:01:36,516 --> 01:01:41,989
If you have sugar, it converts it into fat
and makes it useful for your brain.

826
01:01:42,190 --> 01:01:47,350
But if you think too much, then - and you
don’t take sugar - it’s a double action.

827
01:01:47,550 --> 01:01:51,818
But if you just take sugar and do not think
also can be problem, I think,

828
01:01:52,019 --> 01:01:55,417
because he has to convert too much of -
into fat, you see.

829
01:01:55,618 --> 01:01:57,990
So, too much work is given, there is
no balance.

830
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:01,710
So, one has to understand that too much
sugar is not good,

831
01:02:01,910 --> 01:02:05,230
but you must take sugar, because the sugar
is needed -

832
01:02:05,431 --> 01:02:08,389
and stop your thinking. How do you
stop your thinking?

833
01:02:08,590 --> 01:02:12,895
Only by rising above the Agnya chakra.

834
01:02:14,048 --> 01:02:17,310
This is a very, very important point
at Agnya

835
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:20,590
that you must know that the thinking stops.

836
01:02:20,790 --> 01:02:24,647
Now, the thinking comes to you like this -
like a wave.

837
01:02:24,848 --> 01:02:29,349
It rises the thought and falls off. Another
thought rises and falls off.

838
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:32,850
In between there is a place called
as Vilamba.

839
01:02:33,051 --> 01:02:36,795
Now, when the thought rises it
automatically falls round;

840
01:02:36,996 --> 01:02:40,750
you can see the rising of the thought,
but not falling off.

841
01:02:40,950 --> 01:02:44,030
Now, this space is the place of present.

842
01:02:44,230 --> 01:02:49,550
This rises either from the ego or superego
and goes into the past.

843
01:02:49,750 --> 01:02:55,510
The in-between space is the present.
One is the future, one is the past.

844
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:01,181
Now, this place has to increase. When
it increases, then what happens

845
01:03:01,382 --> 01:03:07,683
is that Agnya chakra opens more, and you
become thoughtlessly aware.

846
01:03:07,884 --> 01:03:10,310
You become thoughtlessly aware,

847
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:13,426
you come in the present. There’s no
thought.

848
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:18,509
And thought is the barrier between
the creation and ourselves.

849
01:03:18,710 --> 01:03:21,522
For example, you look at this - say,
a beautiful stone

850
01:03:21,723 --> 01:03:25,279
that is placed there or anything.
You watch it.

851
01:03:25,480 --> 01:03:27,703
Now, if you want to think, “Oh, it looks
like a man,

852
01:03:27,904 --> 01:03:31,110
it looks like a devil or it looks like
a God”, or whatever it is,

853
01:03:31,310 --> 01:03:33,469
there’s a thought you are putting into.

854
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:37,389
So, what you do when you are realised,
you just watch - you watch.

855
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:42,750
And whatever the joy is put there
of the creator, of an artist,

856
01:03:42,950 --> 01:03:46,389
completely is within you, because there is
no thought.

857
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:55,629
There is no wave, there is no disturbance
in a completely silent lake.

858
01:03:55,830 --> 01:04:04,310
All that is around it, all that creation
comes into it, absolutely reflected,

859
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:09,189
and you enjoy it in thoughtless awareness -
called as Nirvichara Samadhi.

860
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:13,349
There’s complete Nirvichara, where you
have no thought,

861
01:04:13,550 --> 01:04:18,509
and you start enjoying that creation
completely,

862
01:04:18,710 --> 01:04:22,589
the joy of that is there, nothing is lost.

863
01:04:22,790 --> 01:04:27,981
So the thoughtless awareness comes in when
the Kundalini crosses this Agnya chakra.

864
01:04:28,182 --> 01:04:33,709
It does double work. First it makes you
thoughtlessly aware.

865
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:37,230
Secondly, because the Kundalini, if it has
pierced through,

866
01:04:37,430 --> 01:04:42,679
it pushes these, and She fills these with
the grace. The grace falls on these.

867
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:46,047
When the grace comes in, you start
relaxing, these centres also relax.

868
01:04:46,248 --> 01:04:48,304
These centres are in a tension.

869
01:04:48,505 --> 01:04:51,991
But when the grace comes in, they go
back into normal.

870
01:04:52,192 --> 01:04:56,190
So, there is more sort of expansion

871
01:04:56,390 --> 01:05:02,408
and the thoughtless awareness starts
establishing itself at the Agnya chakra.

872
01:05:02,609 --> 01:05:05,150
Now, the mantra of Agnya chakra is
the Lord’s Prayer.

873
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:08,749
It has got two sides, Ham and Ksham.

874
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:12,109
Ham means “I am” and Ksham means
“I forgive”.

875
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:16,109
So, if supposing this is catching, you
have to say, “I forgive”.

876
01:05:16,310 --> 01:05:19,949
If there is ego within us you should say,
“I forgive”.

877
01:05:20,150 --> 01:05:25,549
If there is superego within us you should
say, “I am! I am!”

878
01:05:25,750 --> 01:05:29,189
So, it is Ham and Ksham, is the Bija,
is the seed.

879
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:33,069
Is a seed of the prayer - Lord’s Prayer.

880
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:36,150
Now, there are people who are talking
the Lord’s Prayer is not all right.

881
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:39,024
I mean, who are you, what do you know
about it?

882
01:05:39,225 --> 01:05:43,071
Everybody is challenging everyone. What
do you know? What is your authority?

883
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:49,589
The trouble is everybody is entitled to do
what they like with religion and with God.

884
01:05:49,790 --> 01:05:53,889
Though they do not know anything about it,
they are absolutely ignorant,

885
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:59,768
but they think they have a right. Because
there is no political control over it.

886
01:05:59,969 --> 01:06:04,069
Even Hitler can talk about Christ, anybody
can talk about Him.

887
01:06:04,270 --> 01:06:07,864
And about the Prayer that He taught you,
who are you to challenge it?

888
01:06:08,065 --> 01:06:09,891
Who are you to challenge Him?

889
01:06:10,092 --> 01:06:13,488
I can’t understand how do you challenge
a person

890
01:06:13,689 --> 01:06:18,398
without knowing your own position
in relation to Him.

891
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:24,790
But this is a very, very common thing
that people do and is due to ego.

892
01:06:24,990 --> 01:06:29,645
Ego makes you high-handed. And this is
the worst type of high-handedness

893
01:06:29,846 --> 01:06:31,950
that you challenge God, you challenge
Christ,

894
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:34,549
you challenge everything which you don’t
understand.

895
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:39,429
Your mind is limited. It’s a very limited
vehicle.

896
01:06:39,630 --> 01:06:43,710
You cannot do anything with this mind
of yours. You have to go beyond it.

897
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:46,747
Somebody has to trigger you into the space,
you have to go into there.

898
01:06:46,948 --> 01:06:50,393
You have to become the Spirit. Only
by realising your Spirit

899
01:06:50,594 --> 01:06:56,670
you can get connected with God, which
before that you are not connected.

900
01:06:56,870 --> 01:06:59,309
That’s why you have to become the Spirit.

901
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:05,234
And the Spirit is the connection, is
the link with God.

902
01:07:05,435 --> 01:07:08,074
There is no other way you can be linked
with God.

903
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:11,861
If you want to keep yourself in delusion,
you go ahead with it.

904
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:16,064
But this is the real thing I’m telling you,
it’s the true thing I’m telling you,

905
01:07:16,265 --> 01:07:21,589
for which you should know you cannot pay,
you cannot purchase it,

906
01:07:21,790 --> 01:07:26,390
you cannot demand it, and you cannot work
it out.

907
01:07:26,590 --> 01:07:30,750
The grace of God has to come, fall upon
you to do it,

908
01:07:30,951 --> 01:07:35,669
or a person who is enlightened can only
enlighten you.

909
01:07:35,870 --> 01:07:40,030
Now, about Christ if I have to speak –

910
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:44,070
I’ve spoken once on Christ for seven days,
one after another.

911
01:07:44,270 --> 01:07:48,789
There’s no end to it. He was such
a great incarnation

912
01:07:48,990 --> 01:07:56,550
that I just do not know how to say that
He’s the – I’ve spoken all about Him there.

913
01:07:56,750 --> 01:08:00,030
As it is we have many tapes in London,
you can send for it.

914
01:08:00,230 --> 01:08:04,870
We are now going to have a centre here.
Herman has offered his place.

915
01:08:05,070 --> 01:08:11,429
And we’ll be sending those tapes there,
at least 300 tapes we have got in London,

916
01:08:11,630 --> 01:08:14,430
which you can listen to, and see
for yourself.

917
01:08:14,630 --> 01:08:21,069
And all of these tapes are very good,
because they are actually mantras,

918
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:24,549
they work out the mantras and you also
get - listening to them -

919
01:08:24,750 --> 01:08:28,021
opening of your centres and all that.

920
01:08:28,222 --> 01:08:32,918
Now the last of all, which is embarrassing,
because, you see, already he has told you

921
01:08:33,119 --> 01:08:38,080
that I’m supposed to have been here
at this.

922
01:08:40,630 --> 01:08:45,669
It is the integration.

923
01:08:45,870 --> 01:08:50,195
The end of it is the integration of all
these seven centres.

924
01:08:50,396 --> 01:08:55,811
All these seven centres are placed around
this area called as the Limbic.

925
01:08:56,012 --> 01:08:59,570
This is the Limbic Area. Now, if you
cut it - the brain - like this,

926
01:08:59,771 --> 01:09:04,190
transverse section of the brain, you’ll
find it - it’s like a lotus.

927
01:09:04,390 --> 01:09:10,029
You can find it that there the marking
is like a lotus, opened out.

928
01:09:10,230 --> 01:09:14,800
And its 1000 petals as called, are like
this.

929
01:09:15,001 --> 01:09:21,085
But the colouring is not all right, you
people are so fond of these pastel colours

930
01:09:21,286 --> 01:09:26,389
so they have used it, but we can say that
this kind of a 1000 petals is there.

931
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:31,629
Now it is said in the Bible that “I will
appear before you like tongues of flames.”

932
01:09:31,830 --> 01:09:34,925
And these are, they appear, they all
appear.

933
01:09:35,126 --> 01:09:43,395
But these are very large ones and they
appear as living, living flames

934
01:09:43,596 --> 01:09:48,148
in different colours, starting from one to
another and they are thousand in number.

935
01:09:48,349 --> 01:09:54,069
Now, the doctors argue that “They cannot
be thousand, they have to be 192.”

936
01:09:54,270 --> 01:09:58,310
I mean, just imagine these foolish people -
to argue on that.

937
01:09:58,510 --> 01:10:02,193
But they do not know they are thousand
in number, and they are placed here.

938
01:10:02,394 --> 01:10:07,269
But in the limbic area, all the seven
centres are surrounding here.

939
01:10:07,470 --> 01:10:13,888
Like we have got now, you see, from here,
this is the Agnya chakra. Here.

940
01:10:14,089 --> 01:10:19,110
Behind it here at the back, just exactly
at the back, is the Mooladhara.

941
01:10:19,310 --> 01:10:22,682
Surrounding it is this Swadhishthana.

942
01:10:22,883 --> 01:10:25,742
Surrounding the Mooladhara is
the Swadhishthana.

943
01:10:25,943 --> 01:10:28,657
If you are catching on Swadhishthana,

944
01:10:28,858 --> 01:10:32,001
you can feel it within yourself,
the heaviness here.

945
01:10:32,202 --> 01:10:36,038
If you are catching, say, you have
diabetes, give an example.

946
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,870
Diabetes people get blind after some time.

947
01:10:39,070 --> 01:10:43,547
They lose the power of the eyes, because
this thing oppresses the optic lobe,

948
01:10:43,748 --> 01:10:50,100
which is controlled by the Mooladhara
chakra, we call it as Back Agnya,

949
01:10:50,301 --> 01:10:53,669
this portion at the back.

950
01:10:53,870 --> 01:10:58,538
So, this is the Swadhishthana chakra
here at the back.

951
01:10:58,739 --> 01:11:01,989
In the centre here you find a bone -
that’s the Mooladhara -

952
01:11:02,190 --> 01:11:06,189
and around it is the Swadhishthana chakra.

953
01:11:06,390 --> 01:11:12,560
Then here is the Vishuddhi chakra, is
the Virata. Is the Vishuddhi chakra here.

954
01:11:12,761 --> 01:11:15,626
When you catch cold, you’ll find you’ll
have a problem here.

955
01:11:15,827 --> 01:11:19,430
But if you apply something here, you’ll
feel better.

956
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:23,990
And this is the Vishuddhi chakra which is
related to your throat, this one.

957
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:27,110
Now, if you have problems with collectivity
also,

958
01:11:27,310 --> 01:11:31,829
you might find a big block here.

959
01:11:32,030 --> 01:11:36,669
Now, at the back of it is the Nabhi here,
at the back.

960
01:11:36,870 --> 01:11:40,309
This Nabhi has a left and a right side
as we have shown here.

961
01:11:40,510 --> 01:11:44,232
The left Nabhi and the right Nabhi, there
are two, left and right Nabhi -

962
01:11:44,433 --> 01:11:48,512
I don’t know if I have told you about that,
left - right Nabhi - but, I mean, in the,

963
01:11:48,713 --> 01:11:51,710
you can find out from the book that there
is left and right Nabhi.

964
01:11:51,910 --> 01:11:53,990
So, you have got a left and a right Nabhi.

965
01:11:54,190 --> 01:11:59,451
And also, you sometimes feel the Nabhi
in here. Some people do feel

966
01:11:59,652 --> 01:12:05,990
who have problems with their gurus and
things like that, you see.

967
01:12:06,230 --> 01:12:10,614
Then you feel it. But the whole Void
is here.

968
01:12:10,815 --> 01:12:14,906
And this Void is called as Ekadasha Rudra.

969
01:12:15,107 --> 01:12:20,109
This Void. The whole of it. It goes like
a ring round it. Round.

970
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:23,950
And this ring is very important, because
this you get it from the Void.

971
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:27,926
If you go to a bad guru or someone
you get this.

972
01:12:28,127 --> 01:12:31,771
And this is the one that is of the Rider -
the Rider,

973
01:12:31,972 --> 01:12:34,849
the one who has eleven powers
of destruction,

974
01:12:35,050 --> 01:12:37,206
the one who’s going to come to slash out.

975
01:12:37,407 --> 01:12:39,350
Then He’s not going to give you any
counsel,

976
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:41,949
He is not going to redeem you,
no realisation.

977
01:12:42,150 --> 01:12:44,483
He’ll slash out those who are not realised.

978
01:12:44,684 --> 01:12:47,510
And He will emancipate the ones who
are realised.

979
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:50,088
That’s the last that you don’t ask just
now.

980
01:12:50,289 --> 01:12:54,510
Give some time more to save more people,
because He is not going to question anyone,

981
01:12:54,710 --> 01:12:59,429
He is not going to allow you any more time

982
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:05,260
and that will be the time of complete
destruction of all the satanic forces.

983
01:13:05,461 --> 01:13:08,247
So that is the Ekadasha here. That
collects,

984
01:13:08,448 --> 01:13:12,909
because all these horrible gurus are here.
These are the Ekadashas.

985
01:13:13,110 --> 01:13:16,843
And this is one thing is to be understood

986
01:13:17,044 --> 01:13:19,829
that one should get rid of this very
easily.

987
01:13:20,030 --> 01:13:24,510
Now, these two children of Rama who
were born here,

988
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:28,870
and they are endowed on the sun and
the moon.

989
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:31,549
The sun and the moon both are here.

990
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:36,101
And the sun became - as I told you -
Buddha ultimately here,

991
01:13:36,302 --> 01:13:41,933
and he became the - not ultimately -
the Mahavira, they are here.

992
01:13:42,134 --> 01:13:46,598
But when they were on this earth, Buddha
talked about non-violence,

993
01:13:46,799 --> 01:13:54,233
and people thought non-violence
to chickens, to bugs.

994
01:13:54,434 --> 01:13:58,537
These Mahavira people, these Jains, we have
got horrible community

995
01:13:58,738 --> 01:14:02,910
called Jains in India. And they believe
in vegetarianism to this extent

996
01:14:03,111 --> 01:14:07,928
that they get a Brahmin, pay him money
and put him in a hut

997
01:14:08,129 --> 01:14:13,007
and bring all the bugs of the village,
put those in the hut

998
01:14:13,208 --> 01:14:16,710
and the bugs live on that Brahmin.
Is a fact, even today they do it.

999
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:21,403
And then they pay some money
to the Brahmin, because the bugs are fed.

1000
01:14:21,604 --> 01:14:25,189
Now, you just tell me this kind
of a nonsensical vegetarianism.

1001
01:14:25,390 --> 01:14:29,029
Am I going to give realisation to chickens?

1002
01:14:29,230 --> 01:14:32,750
Just think of it. Or to the bugs or
to the earthworms?

1003
01:14:32,950 --> 01:14:36,430
You are human beings, you should
eat a flesh

1004
01:14:36,630 --> 01:14:40,192
which is not of a bigger animal than
yourself, because that’s horrid.

1005
01:14:40,393 --> 01:14:44,430
But you can eat the flesh of the animals
which are smaller than you.

1006
01:14:44,630 --> 01:14:48,590
There’s no harm in eating that - and this
kind of a nonsensical vegetarianism,

1007
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:52,531
“Don’t do any harm to the animals”, but
they don’t mind doing this.

1008
01:14:52,732 --> 01:14:58,451
Jains are the greatest, they are, you see,
such - just like suckers.

1009
01:14:58,652 --> 01:15:01,774
And they don’t mind killing people for
their money.

1010
01:15:01,975 --> 01:15:08,063
They don’t mind going for - what you call -
shikars, in hunting and killing anything;

1011
01:15:08,264 --> 01:15:15,190
but they will not eat a chicken or even
the garlic.

1012
01:15:15,390 --> 01:15:21,141
Now, garlic, as you know, is very good
for the heart. But they don’t eat garlic.

1013
01:15:21,342 --> 01:15:24,793
It’s very good for the heart, it’s very
good for people who have got

1014
01:15:24,994 --> 01:15:28,029
a tendency towards hardening
of the arteries,

1015
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:32,309
when the circulation is a problem, it’s
very good to eat that, and for cold.

1016
01:15:32,510 --> 01:15:35,545
Those people who suffer from cold, if they
regularly eat

1017
01:15:35,746 --> 01:15:40,852
a fresh garlic thing in the night, brush
their teeth, they’ll be much better off.

1018
01:15:41,053 --> 01:15:45,938
So, while talking about it I would say.
Now, these seven centres are here.

1019
01:15:46,139 --> 01:15:52,507
Now, at the fontanel bone is the centre
of the heart.

1020
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:57,149
Now, just imagine, it is at the centre.
So, where do I exist?

1021
01:15:57,350 --> 01:16:02,207
I mean, all of them are seven centres,
so I am just like a bubble.

1022
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:05,509
But if I am in your heart, I’m there.

1023
01:16:05,710 --> 01:16:12,242
So, the key of Sahaja Yoga that you have
to recognise me.

1024
01:16:12,443 --> 01:16:15,455
If you cannot recognise me you cannot
progress in Sahaja Yoga,

1025
01:16:15,656 --> 01:16:19,149
I have to frankly admit it. Because
he’s already exposed me,

1026
01:16:19,350 --> 01:16:21,587
I don’t tell this in my first lectures,

1027
01:16:21,788 --> 01:16:24,869
but I have to say that “Please, now
recognise me.”

1028
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:28,030
As your Mother I would request you
to recognise me.

1029
01:16:28,230 --> 01:16:31,819
And you don’t have to give me anything,
just take things from me.

1030
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:34,381
Just have it yourself. But recognise me.

1031
01:16:34,582 --> 01:16:38,556
If you deny me then this won’t open,
this will be always covered.

1032
01:16:38,757 --> 01:16:41,901
That’s why at the end when you say,
“Mother, give me my realisation.”

1033
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:44,510
Because I have come on this earth to give
you realisation.

1034
01:16:44,710 --> 01:16:50,856
That’s my job. It’s one of the worst jobs
that one can have.

1035
01:16:54,023 --> 01:16:58,291
Because it is so difficult with people:
to talk to them, to tell them about it,

1036
01:16:58,492 --> 01:17:03,510
and they are all the time up in arms, they
are so aggressive, and they start fighting.

1037
01:17:03,710 --> 01:17:07,538
It’s a Mother’s job, which is a thankless
job, absolute thankless job.

1038
01:17:07,739 --> 01:17:11,308
I have to do it. And also only Mother can
do it. Because if you had Christ,

1039
01:17:11,509 --> 01:17:14,350
He would have taken those eleven things
and finished off everyone.

1040
01:17:14,550 --> 01:17:18,439
If you had asked Christ – Krishna - He had
also Samhara Shakti, He would have killed.

1041
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:22,558
But to use the whole thing with integrated
idea and with balancing,

1042
01:17:22,759 --> 01:17:25,670
with understanding human beings you have
to have a Mother.

1043
01:17:25,870 --> 01:17:29,230
And that’s why sometimes people try
to become very familiar

1044
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:36,562
and start taking advantage or taking
liberties, which is a wrong thing.

1045
01:17:36,763 --> 01:17:42,481
Whatever I am I am and I’m Love -
I can’t help it.

1046
01:17:42,682 --> 01:17:45,714
I really can’t help it. I’m Compassion.

1047
01:17:45,915 --> 01:17:50,039
One day I did feel very disgusted, really.
Once I did feel very disgusted with people

1048
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:55,169
the way they were, and I was just saying
that “Forget it!”

1049
01:17:55,370 --> 01:17:59,550
And then suddenly, I saw my photograph
and I saw my eyes,

1050
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:04,233
and I said, “Nirmala, you are Compassion,
you are Compassion, you can’t help it.

1051
01:18:04,434 --> 01:18:07,150
YYou just can’t help it.” I have to work
it out.

1052
01:18:07,351 --> 01:18:14,830
I know it means, it means sometimes too
much, too much, but I have to work it out.

1053
01:18:15,030 --> 01:18:18,630
Now, some people come out with
a question, “Why You, Mother?”

1054
01:18:18,854 --> 01:18:23,878
I said, “Why not you, it’s a good idea!
Come along and do it!”

1055
01:18:24,079 --> 01:18:26,665
I’ll be the best - it will be the best
for me to retire,

1056
01:18:26,866 --> 01:18:30,168
and my husband might give you a pension
for it, he’ll so happy

1057
01:18:30,369 --> 01:18:32,606
that I’ve found out somebody who will
replace me.

1058
01:18:32,807 --> 01:18:35,229
But I have not yet found out somebody
who will replace me,

1059
01:18:35,430 --> 01:18:37,669
I wish you could, will be a good idea.

1060
01:18:37,870 --> 01:18:41,083
Now, the name Nirmala itself is, means
Immaculate.

1061
01:18:41,284 --> 01:18:46,731
Means, the one who is the cleansing power.
Is a name of the Goddess also.

1062
01:18:46,932 --> 01:18:51,509
My, actually sign name is Lalita, is
the name of the Primordial Mother -

1063
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:56,269
that is the name of the Primordial Mother.

1064
01:18:56,470 --> 01:19:00,889
But to be a human being with all these
centres around you working,

1065
01:19:01,090 --> 01:19:04,368
for example for the last three days you
don’t know how much I am vibrating,

1066
01:19:04,569 --> 01:19:08,185
you can ask Warren and other people,
I asked them to take the vibrations,

1067
01:19:08,386 --> 01:19:10,339
and they were doing like this, where
they couldn’t touch me.

1068
01:19:10,540 --> 01:19:13,949
They tried to put the hand on the head,
and they were just –

1069
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:17,870
and they didn’t know how to touch me,
even it is so much vibrating.

1070
01:19:18,070 --> 01:19:22,909
So, it’s not easy to carry this, all this
load on this human body,

1071
01:19:23,110 --> 01:19:26,052
appear like a human being, to act like
a human being,

1072
01:19:26,253 --> 01:19:30,109
to behave like a human being, so that
there is a rapport.

1073
01:19:30,310 --> 01:19:33,781
Why an Incarnation is needed? There
has to be a rapport,

1074
01:19:33,982 --> 01:19:38,555
because the Unconscious cannot talk to you,
whatever you see in the dream

1075
01:19:38,756 --> 01:19:42,084
comes back to you afterwards from
the subconscious area -

1076
01:19:42,285 --> 01:19:49,990
all the ideas will be such a mess, such
a confusion and you cannot decide anything.

1077
01:19:50,190 --> 01:19:56,709
So, it has to come on this earth as a human
being and tell you with a language.

1078
01:19:56,910 --> 01:20:00,029
I never knew English all my life.

1079
01:20:00,230 --> 01:20:03,629
So, first time I learnt English, but still
I don’t know American English.

1080
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:09,909
I hope I’ll be able to learn something more
when I travel around

1081
01:20:10,110 --> 01:20:14,909
and it’s a thing that - it’s God’s desire
that you are to be realised.

1082
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:19,870
It’s all written in the Bible; it’s all
written in all the books of the scriptures.

1083
01:20:20,070 --> 01:20:25,113
It is very largely written in the books
of Adi Shankaracharya,

1084
01:20:25,314 --> 01:20:29,029
who had described me fully, in a very
full way.

1085
01:20:29,230 --> 01:20:32,533
And it’s easy for Indians to get to me.

1086
01:20:32,734 --> 01:20:37,411
I mean, though I have not much disciples
in the cities,

1087
01:20:37,612 --> 01:20:41,070
but they are aware of my Advent and they
know that I am there.

1088
01:20:41,271 --> 01:20:43,775
Most of them know about it.

1089
01:20:43,976 --> 01:20:47,630
But they can’t understand why I have
come to America.

1090
01:20:47,830 --> 01:20:53,142
They say that “Why do you come here?
The people here won’t accept You.”

1091
01:20:53,343 --> 01:20:58,673
But I don’t think so, because I think you
are great seekers, very great seekers,

1092
01:20:58,874 --> 01:21:03,229
born in this country - you are a special
type, and I have to work for you.

1093
01:21:03,430 --> 01:21:08,961
I must say the transformation that has
taken place in the western sahaja yogis

1094
01:21:09,162 --> 01:21:11,142
has not been achieved by Indians so much.

1095
01:21:11,343 --> 01:21:13,950
Though they have an advantage because
they are born in a country

1096
01:21:14,151 --> 01:21:17,916
which has basics, which keeps the attention
intact.

1097
01:21:18,117 --> 01:21:22,140
The attention is very much intact. So,
it is easy to work it out there -

1098
01:21:22,341 --> 01:21:24,846
here it is difficult, it doesn’t appeal
to people,

1099
01:21:25,047 --> 01:21:29,142
but still, you are all great people,
so many of you are lost,

1100
01:21:29,343 --> 01:21:33,310
but they can be all saved. But those
who are here should know

1101
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:37,436
that you have the greatest opportunity
in your lives today

1102
01:21:37,637 --> 01:21:41,469
to be realised and to give realisation
to others.

1103
01:21:41,670 --> 01:21:46,790
First of all, you have to become all right.
Then you can give light to others.

1104
01:21:46,990 --> 01:21:52,538
Now, the greatest thing that is needed
for Sahaja Yoga is wisdom.

1105
01:21:52,739 --> 01:21:57,237
And logically you will reach at
a conclusion and understand

1106
01:21:57,438 --> 01:22:01,778
that Sahaja Yoga is the end of all
the problems of the world.

1107
01:22:01,979 --> 01:22:06,229
Of all the problems of the world. For
example take the capitalism and communism.

1108
01:22:06,430 --> 01:22:09,558
Now, I am a capitalist, because I have
all the powers,

1109
01:22:09,759 --> 01:22:13,179
and I am the communist, because I cannot
enjoy it without giving it to you.

1110
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:16,012
But it’s spontaneous, I have not to do it

1111
01:22:16,213 --> 01:22:19,990
because I think about it, it just works.
It is like that.

1112
01:22:20,190 --> 01:22:23,207
All the problems: political problems,
economic problems -

1113
01:22:23,408 --> 01:22:28,270
everything can be solved. Krishna has
said, “Yoga Kshema Vahamyaham.”

1114
01:22:28,470 --> 01:22:32,694
“When you get your Yoga, you get your
well-being.” He has promised it.

1115
01:22:32,895 --> 01:22:35,389
He could have said it, “Kshema Yoga
Vahamyaham.”

1116
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:39,755
He did not, he said, “Yoga Kshema
Vahamyaham.” First your yoga, first unite.

1117
01:22:39,956 --> 01:22:43,029
Unite with the Spirit, then you are
blessed by all these things.

1118
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:47,843
This is the centre of even material wealth,
of Lakshmi, which works out.

1119
01:22:48,044 --> 01:22:53,174
And all the sahaja yogis who have been to
me, are blessed by material wealth also,

1120
01:22:53,375 --> 01:22:57,429
but not too much like Mister Ford - that’s
an extreme case, that’s a headache,

1121
01:22:57,630 --> 01:23:03,430
but they get well-being from every angle,
in a balanced way and integrated way.

1122
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:07,789
So the last method is of integration - that
you get completely integrated.

1123
01:23:07,990 --> 01:23:10,693
Whatever you do, your heart supports it,

1124
01:23:10,894 --> 01:23:13,789
your mind supports it, and your body
supports it.

1125
01:23:13,990 --> 01:23:18,240
You are completely integrated in one
being - that is your Spirit.

1126
01:23:18,441 --> 01:23:19,430
May God bless you all.

1127
01:23:19,630 --> 01:23:23,350
So, now this is the last lecture and I’m
going to Philadelphia,

1128
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:28,230
and you pray that Philadelphia people
get realisation more,

1129
01:23:28,430 --> 01:23:34,190
and we get more people into Sahaj Yog,
and that they become enlightened.

1130
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:40,030
Then I’ll be going to Houston, then to
Los Angeles and Vancouver for a day.

1131
01:23:40,231 --> 01:23:44,230
If you have any friends or relatives there
you can write to them,

1132
01:23:44,430 --> 01:23:49,132
take the address, so that they contact
and they come down to the program.

1133
01:23:49,333 --> 01:23:52,285
May God bless you all.

1134
01:23:59,669 --> 01:24:03,879
Normally, I don’t tell about myself, but
today he exposed me as soon as I came,

1135
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:09,149
I had to tell, because it’s not tactful.
It’s not tactful to say anything

1136
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:11,626
It’s better that you discover me than
I tell you,

1137
01:24:11,827 --> 01:24:16,278
because Christ was crucified, everybody
was tortured.

1138
01:24:16,479 --> 01:24:18,848
I do not want to hamper my work,

1139
01:24:19,049 --> 01:24:22,644
because it makes no difference by telling
you anything before realisation.

1140
01:24:22,845 --> 01:24:27,472
It’s better to tell you after realisation
that I am the Holy Ghost, no doubt.

1141
01:24:27,673 --> 01:24:30,590
I am the one about which Christ has talked.

1142
01:24:30,790 --> 01:24:37,350
I had told them, I had never said this
on - from a…

1143
01:24:38,376 --> 01:24:42,695
[Yogini: “Platform”] platform, and I told,
they have been telling me,

1144
01:24:42,896 --> 01:24:45,989
“Mother, You must say that once.”
I said, “In America I’ll declare it.”

1145
01:24:46,190 --> 01:24:50,889
So, today I declare that I am the Holy
Ghost, I am the Holy Spirit,

1146
01:24:51,090 --> 01:24:55,068
who has incarnated on this earth
for your realisation.

1147
01:24:55,269 --> 01:24:58,053
May God bless you.

1148
01:25:03,421 --> 01:25:05,580
Now, any questions?

1149
01:25:05,790 --> 01:25:08,940
Man: Mother, I’d just like to say,
“I love You!”

1150
01:25:09,141 --> 01:25:15,395
Shri Mataji: What’s it? Man: And I
would like to sometime tonight

1151
01:25:15,596 --> 01:25:19,026
take the rest of the pictures because I’m
not sure the others still have.

1152
01:25:19,227 --> 01:25:24,630
And this is my important question: how
can I still my thoughts?

1153
01:25:24,831 --> 01:25:28,211
Shri Mataji: What did he say?
Man: How can I still my thoughts?

1154
01:25:28,412 --> 01:25:31,631
Warren: He wants to know how can he
still his thoughts. Shri Mataji: Eh?

1155
01:25:31,845 --> 01:25:35,522
Warren: How can he still his thoughts.
Shri Mataji: How can he? What?

1156
01:25:35,723 --> 01:25:39,349
Warren: Make himself thoughtless.

1157
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:41,711
Shri Mataji: You just say Lord’s Prayer.

1158
01:25:41,912 --> 01:25:45,589
Now, before my photograph. All right?
It will work out.

1159
01:25:45,790 --> 01:25:51,287
Lord’s Prayer is the entry, it’s
the entry, no doubt.

1160
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:56,989
Warren: There’s a little announcement
concerning all of you –

1161
01:25:57,190 --> 01:26:02,776
there is a photograph of Mataji which
is available from Tracy,

1162
01:26:02,977 --> 01:26:06,178
who is sitting over there, which you
can buy,

1163
01:26:06,379 --> 01:26:11,704
it’s a very good quality black and white
photograph, and she has a few tonight.

1164
01:26:11,905 --> 01:26:14,456
Christine will have a stock of those
photographs.

1165
01:26:14,657 --> 01:26:19,002
There is also a book called “The Advent”,
which a few people already received,

1166
01:26:19,202 --> 01:26:22,990
about Mataji’s advent and about Sahaja
Yoga,

1167
01:26:23,191 --> 01:26:29,675
which you’ll be able to buy once you settle
into Sahaja Yoga.

1168
01:26:31,037 --> 01:26:37,735
Don’t forget that Christine is here,
Herman is here...
