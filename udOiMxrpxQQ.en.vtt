00:00:07.601 --> 00:00:10.033
The Shakti of forgiveness too is great.

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:12.000
You should also learn to forgive.

00:00:12.067 --> 00:00:15.200
I see that, in Sahaja Yoga people forgive very little.

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:16.601
Learn to forgive,

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:20.601
Without forgiving, you cannot get realisation on your own.

00:00:21.434 --> 00:00:23.534
For example, if somebody has hurt you,

00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.868
and you didn't forgive him, then what did you do?

00:00:26.968 --> 00:00:28.534
You didn't do anything.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.601
If you didn't forgive, means, you didn't do anything.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:36.367
Even if you forgive, strictly speaking means you didn't do anything.

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:37.834
But if you say, i forgive,

00:00:37.934 --> 00:00:42.634
then by not forgiving, you were playing in other's hands

00:00:42.734 --> 00:00:45.133
he loses all his Shakti.

00:00:46.067 --> 00:00:48.067
The destructive power gets destroyed.

00:00:48.167 --> 00:00:50.200
But those who are forgiving,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.067
their Shakti is so powerful, that wherever they stand,

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:57.934
because of their forgiveness, people can become pious.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.868
Their vices of numerous births, can be washed out.

00:01:00.968 --> 00:01:02.968
From all previous births

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:06.467
whatsoever problems, they have accumulated, can be over,

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:08.200
because, he they have forgiven.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:11.567
Redemption from all sins is obtained only by kshma Shakti.

00:01:11.634 --> 00:01:16.567
Many a times, we say to God, "You are ocean of forgiveness !"

00:01:16.634 --> 00:01:19.334
We also say, that you are the remover of sins.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.133
We also say, "Destroy our papaas."

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.400
How can He do? Only by forgiveness !

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:26.634
By his uttering only one word 'forgive',

00:01:26.734 --> 00:01:30.534
by his one sight, by the sight of forgiveness only,

00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.334
all the sins are destroyed.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.067
But because we have not seen such people,

00:01:35.167 --> 00:01:38.801
We don't even think about such people,

00:01:38.868 --> 00:01:43.067
We can't even believe, that such people can be in the world.

00:01:43.868 --> 00:01:46.367
We have to find such people today.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000
And you know, what you were, are not today.

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.834
and what you are today, you won't be like that tomorrow.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:56.434
Tommorow, such people will be in Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:59.267
who have kindness, forgiveness and peacefulness.

00:01:59.968 --> 00:02:02.267
All these Shakhtis, are ignited.

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:05.234
On account of those, We will get all type of

00:02:05.334 --> 00:02:08.133
comfort, pleasure and peace in the whole universe.

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:17.234
(I never expected) all of you to be here present for the puja.

00:02:20.634 --> 00:02:26.534
I don't know how you all have managed to come.

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:51.200
Otherwise, it's a very important day today for all of us

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.033
because you know

00:02:57.634 --> 00:03:03.601
how Christ died. He was crucified.

00:03:03.667 --> 00:03:09.334
He was put on the cross and then He died.

00:03:11.434 --> 00:03:16.400
Wonderful the way He said

00:03:21.267 --> 00:03:26.367
about you people.

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:33.567
He asked for forgiveness from God.

00:03:33.634 --> 00:03:39.968
What we have to learn from His life is

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:45.667
the way He knew how to forgive all of us.

00:03:48.067 --> 00:03:51.367
We have to also forgive people.

00:03:51.434 --> 00:03:57.167
That seems to be very difficult for people to forgive.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:04:04.934
And if they are angry, they are angry,

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.200
they cannot forgive. Then you are no more sahaja yogis.

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:18.567
Sahaja yogis must forgive, it's very important

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.200
because that is the power you have got from Christ: to forgive.

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:39.267
Human beings make mistakes; that is a part of their life.

00:04:39.367 --> 00:04:44.767
But at the same time, as sahaja yogis you must remember

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.801
that you have to forgive.

00:04:47.868 --> 00:04:53.601
That is much more important than getting angry.

00:04:54.167 --> 00:05:02.033
So to forgive people for doing something wrong according to you

00:05:02.133 --> 00:05:07.801
or according to God, you have to forgive.

00:05:07.868 --> 00:05:14.033
And you will be surprised that the forgiveness

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:20.567
is such a great, satisfying quality.

00:05:21.267 --> 00:05:24.868
If you can forgive people,

00:05:26.801 --> 00:05:33.200
you will become extremely pure

00:05:35.033 --> 00:05:45.934
because the dirt or the anger that is within us goes out.

00:05:46.667 --> 00:05:55.234
So to forgive is the biggest blessings human beings have.

00:05:57.267 --> 00:06:00.734
Even Christ said the same thing

00:06:01.234 --> 00:06:05.667
that, "Forgive them because they don't know what they are doing."

00:06:05.767 --> 00:06:11.334
So if Christ had to say, so what about you?

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:18.801
We are ordinary human beings and if we have done mistakes,

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:24.934
people can get angry and upset with you.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:30.334
But the best thing for you is to forgive.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:37.634
Forgive for doing something that should not have been done.

00:06:37.734 --> 00:06:46.400
This was the biggest quality of Christ: that He knew how to forgive.

00:06:46.467 --> 00:06:54.133
And He forgave people who had made horrible mistakes.

00:06:54.200 --> 00:07:02.367
Still He forgave them because He loved them.

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:10.467
And that is what you should also forgive.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:17.968
Today is a special day for that - special day for forgiveness.

00:07:19.567 --> 00:07:25.234
And that is why I said, whatever you may think,

00:07:25.334 --> 00:07:30.267
it's very late, but we'll have a meeting

00:07:30.367 --> 00:07:34.634
because I didn't want to miss the time.

00:07:38.968 --> 00:07:48.667
Forgiveness comes by people who are very generous, who are good-hearted.

00:07:51.033 --> 00:07:58.033
You, everybody makes mistakes and so we can also make mistakes.

00:07:58.133 --> 00:08:03.567
But that means we have a right to forgive

00:08:03.634 --> 00:08:08.567
and we have a heart to forgive.

00:08:09.334 --> 00:08:13.033
If you don't have, then we are not sahaja yogis.

00:08:13.767 --> 00:08:23.367
We must learn to forgive and forgive without any remarks behind it.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:33.567
Today is a very special day because that's what Christ did.

00:08:33.634 --> 00:08:45.400
He was one of the most powerful deities or gods as we may say, most powerful.

00:08:45.467 --> 00:08:50.767
He could do anything; He could punish them,

00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:55.968
all of them, for misbehaving.

00:08:57.734 --> 00:09:04.200
But what did He say? He said, "I forgive"

00:09:04.267 --> 00:09:07.968
and He asked God also to forgive.

00:09:08.968 --> 00:09:15.934
So whatever may be your powers,

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.801
whatever you might have achieved in your life,

00:09:21.868 --> 00:09:26.167
whatever position you might be occupying,

00:09:26.234 --> 00:09:32.467
but you must learn the way to forgive.

00:09:32.567 --> 00:09:36.534
Otherwise you are nowhere near Christ.

00:09:36.601 --> 00:09:42.667
You must learn to forgive; that's a very great quality

00:09:42.767 --> 00:09:48.434
if you can forgive, all the time forgive.

00:09:48.534 --> 00:09:56.234
And that's why today I wanted to meet you all, so I did.

00:09:57.734 --> 00:10:03.033
I wanted to meet you all and tell you

00:10:03.133 --> 00:10:10.968
that today is a day to forgive.

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:20.167
That doesn't mean you sit down and think, oh, how many people you have to forgive.

00:10:21.534 --> 00:10:24.834
That would be absurd.

00:10:26.634 --> 00:10:31.367
But something that haunts your mind

00:10:36.868 --> 00:10:46.567
and you think you all been troubled and you have been put to trouble.

00:10:46.634 --> 00:10:54.434
Then just think that you don't know how many powers you have

00:10:54.534 --> 00:11:01.234
and you can't even forgive. When you have got all these powers;

00:11:01.334 --> 00:11:06.167
the greatest power you have got is to forgive.

00:11:06.767 --> 00:11:12.167
And today is the day for forgiving,

00:11:12.234 --> 00:11:18.934
forgiving people whom you think they have done wrong to you,

00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:27.801
or they have been unkind to you. Please try to remember

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.000
how many you are still angry.

00:11:35.067 --> 00:11:39.934
Just forgive them. Then you have punished them.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.567
If you forgive them from your heart, then you have punished them.

00:11:46.634 --> 00:11:54.367
You have given them back, whatever they wanted, they deserved.

00:11:54.434 --> 00:12:01.868
So this is not a very difficult thing, to forgive,

00:12:01.968 --> 00:12:06.167
but people think it's very difficult to forgive

00:12:06.234 --> 00:12:12.868
because they have certain great understandings about themselves.

00:12:12.968 --> 00:12:20.167
And then they think how can they forgive?

00:12:22.534 --> 00:12:29.133
I don't know what things upset you, anything can upset you.

00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:37.467
After all, you are all realized souls, you have got your second birth

00:12:37.567 --> 00:12:44.601
and you are special people. So you should have a special quality.

00:12:44.667 --> 00:12:53.133
And the special quality is to forgive, to forgive.

00:12:53.200 --> 00:13:01.601
Not to go on remembering on what things you should be angry and you should be upset.

00:13:01.667 --> 00:13:07.267
But just to remember what things you have to forgive.

00:13:07.367 --> 00:13:09.868
Just forgive.

00:13:09.968 --> 00:13:12.567
For what?

00:13:15.868 --> 00:13:24.033
Is a practical thing, most practical.

00:13:24.133 --> 00:13:30.033
Supposing somebody slaps me, alright.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:36.667
If somebody slaps me, what should I do?

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:41.767
I should slap him back? No.

00:13:41.834 --> 00:13:49.934
Then why should I ask him, "Why did you slap me?" No.

00:13:50.934 --> 00:13:57.534
Then I should think he must be stupid fool to do like that?

00:13:58.234 --> 00:14:08.234
Even that won't help. On the contrary, if you can just forgive,

00:14:08.767 --> 00:14:17.200
forgive that person who has done something wrong...

00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:30.400
For you it is important that you must forgive because has no effect.

00:14:30.467 --> 00:14:36.200
Once you forgive, it will have more effect

00:14:36.267 --> 00:14:42.334
on you, your goodness, your righteousness.

00:14:42.968 --> 00:14:50.400
But I think human beings find it difficult to forgive normally.

00:14:50.467 --> 00:14:53.033
Normally.

00:14:55.868 --> 00:15:03.801
But you are all realized souls; you are not only human beings.

00:15:03.868 --> 00:15:12.267
That's why I'm requesting you that remember you have a power to forgive.

00:15:12.834 --> 00:15:18.167
To forgive everyone who hurts you,

00:15:18.234 --> 00:15:26.234
who tortures you, who troubles you. How far can he go?

00:15:26.334 --> 00:15:36.167
Just think of forgiving him and you'll be amazed, he will change.

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:45.367
He will change and you will also enjoy yourself.

00:15:46.334 --> 00:15:54.334
It's a difficult thing for people to understand, but just try.

00:15:54.400 --> 00:16:00.667
Just try what I'm saying. If somebody does any harm to you,

00:16:00.767 --> 00:16:06.400
just forgive that person and see the reaction,

00:16:06.467 --> 00:16:13.667
reaction in that person and in yourself. What happens?

00:16:13.767 --> 00:16:21.968
But if you want to carry the burden of his anger or of stupidity, whatever it is,

00:16:22.033 --> 00:16:29.801
then you are unnecessarily loaded with useless things.

00:16:29.868 --> 00:16:38.834
We should not waste our energy on deciding

00:16:38.934 --> 00:16:44.601
what's wrong, what did he do and what you should do to him,

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:48.000
that we should not.

00:16:48.067 --> 00:16:58.534
Just leave him alone and you just forgive. Say that, "I forgive."

00:16:58.601 --> 00:17:06.400
Look at Christ. Such a powerful person; such a powerful god!

00:17:06.467 --> 00:17:12.267
And when He was crucified,

00:17:12.367 --> 00:17:18.734
how He asked for forgiveness for them.

00:17:18.801 --> 00:17:25.067
Why did He do it? Because that has power.

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:34.033
Saying, "I forgive", it's very powerful.

00:17:34.634 --> 00:17:41.434
You don't lose your power, but on the contrary,

00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:48.200
you go higher in your power.

00:17:49.367 --> 00:17:54.334
You go higher in your personality.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:59.734
Just forgive. As simple as that.

00:17:59.801 --> 00:18:07.167
To say that, "I forgive," just like that.

00:18:07.234 --> 00:18:19.234
That's how I do because people have their own whims

00:18:19.334 --> 00:18:27.434
and they do whatever they like, but I don't get angry on that point.

00:18:27.534 --> 00:18:34.133
And I'm not upset on that point, neither I am concerned.

00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:40.801
I just say, "I forgive," that's all.

00:18:40.868 --> 00:18:48.801
And you'll be amazed, within myself, it so helps so much,

00:18:48.868 --> 00:18:51.801
really very helpful.

00:18:51.868 --> 00:19:02.868
So this is a very big quality for which today is a special day.

00:19:03.601 --> 00:19:09.968
On the cross Christ said that, "Oh God, forgive them because they don't know

00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:20.467
what they are doing." On the cross where He was dying He said this,

00:19:21.567 --> 00:19:27.968
and what we have to learn is to forgive,

00:19:28.033 --> 00:19:36.601
for our sake, not for others. This helps us. If we forgive,

00:19:36.667 --> 00:19:41.968
this will help us very much within ourselves.

00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:49.801
This is the message for today and permanently. Permanently.

00:19:50.334 --> 00:19:55.634
Always, if you are angry with anyone,

00:19:55.734 --> 00:19:58.868
just say, "I forgive."

00:19:58.968 --> 00:20:07.033
If you find somebody hurting you or troubling you or torturing you,

00:20:07.133 --> 00:20:15.334
how you will work on it? Just forgive, just forgive. This is the only way.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:21.634
Today that's why is very important day for us and I'm so very happy

00:20:21.734 --> 00:20:27.801
there‘s a wonderful site here and then I can speak to you.

00:20:28.734 --> 00:20:31.067
Thank you.
