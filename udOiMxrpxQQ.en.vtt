00:00:07.595 --> 00:00:10.060
The Shakti of forgiveness too is great.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.000
You should also learn to forgive.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.206
I see that, in Sahaja Yoga people forgive very little.

00:00:15.286 --> 00:00:16.610
Learn to forgive,

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.606
Without forgiving, you cannot get realisation on your own.

00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.833
For example, if somebody has hurt you,

00:00:23.913 --> 00:00:26.432
and you didn't forgive him, then what did you do?

00:00:26.512 --> 00:00:28.068
You didn't do anything.

00:00:29.594 --> 00:00:32.744
If you didn't forgive, means, you didn't do anything.

00:00:32.824 --> 00:00:36.354
Even if you forgive, strictly speaking
means you didn't do anything.

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:37.868
But if you say, i forgive,

00:00:37.948 --> 00:00:42.648
then by not forgiving, you were playing in other's hands

00:00:42.728 --> 00:00:45.138
he loses all his Shakti.

00:00:46.081 --> 00:00:48.068
The destructive power gets destroyed.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.193
But those who are forgiving,

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.066
their Shakti is so powerful, that wherever they stand,

00:00:55.146 --> 00:00:58.315
because of their forgiveness, people can become pious.

00:00:58.395 --> 00:01:01.088
Their vices of numerous births, can be washed out.

00:01:01.168 --> 00:01:02.943
From all previous birth's

00:01:03.023 --> 00:01:06.472
whatsoever problems, they have accumulated, can be over,

00:01:06.552 --> 00:01:08.201
because, he they have forgiven.

00:01:08.281 --> 00:01:11.588
Redemption from all sins is obtained only by kshma Shakti.

00:01:11.668 --> 00:01:16.555
Many a times, we say to God,
"You are ocean of forgiveness !"

00:01:16.635 --> 00:01:19.313
We also say, that you are the remover of sins.

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:22.247
We also say, "Destroy our papaas."

00:01:22.327 --> 00:01:24.407
How can He do? Only by forgiveness !

00:01:24.487 --> 00:01:26.638
By his uttering only one word 'forgive',

00:01:26.718 --> 00:01:30.515
by his one sight, by the sight of forgiveness only,

00:01:30.595 --> 00:01:32.335
all the sins are destroyed.

00:01:32.415 --> 00:01:35.096
But because we have not seen such people,

00:01:35.176 --> 00:01:38.810
We don't even think about such people,

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.826
We can't even believe, that
such people can be in the world.

00:01:43.881 --> 00:01:46.377
We have to find such people today.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.377
And you know, what you were, are not today.

00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:53.855
and what you are today, you won't be like that tomorrow.

00:01:53.935 --> 00:01:56.465
Tommorow, such people will be in Sahaja Yoga,

00:01:56.545 --> 00:01:59.296
who have kindness, forgiveness and peacefulness.

00:01:59.977 --> 00:02:02.284
All these Shakhtis, are ignited.

00:02:02.364 --> 00:02:05.246
On account of those, We will get all type of

00:02:05.326 --> 00:02:08.110
comfort, pleasure and peace in the whole universe.
