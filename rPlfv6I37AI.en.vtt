WEBVTT

00:13.600 --> 00:21.960
Today is the happiest day for all of you,

00:22.160 --> 00:24.640
for the whole universe,

00:24.800 --> 00:29.800
because Shri Ganesha was created.

00:29.960 --> 00:36.800
He was created to emit auspiciousness

00:36.960 --> 00:40.400
through His Chaitanya [Divine Vibrations].

00:41.320 --> 00:46.440
First, the whole cosmos was filled

00:46.600 --> 00:51.640
with this Chaitanyasrishti [creation of Divine Vibrations].

00:52.200 --> 00:55.480
Then Brahmadeva came into play,

00:55.640 --> 00:59.360
and He created all the matter.

01:18.120 --> 01:23.480
But the greatest blessings

01:24.560 --> 01:27.400
of the Divine Power

01:27.560 --> 01:33.280
was to symbolize Chaitanya,

01:35.600 --> 01:42.840
and this Chaitanya has many aspects,

01:42.960 --> 01:46.000
but specially in Shri Ganesha,

01:46.160 --> 01:48.720
it is auspiciousness.

01:48.880 --> 01:55.120
In these modern times people have lost the sense of auspiciousness.

01:55.440 --> 02:00.960
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya, is auspicious,

02:01.120 --> 02:09.760
is shubh, and whatever does not is not by any chance auspicious.

02:09.920 --> 02:14.760
So first of all, whatever you worship,

02:14.920 --> 02:17.560
whatever you accept,

02:17.720 --> 02:21.120
all of them have to be auspicious things.

02:21.280 --> 02:24.200
Every shape has a coefficience

02:24.360 --> 02:27.920
and all these shapes which you see,

02:28.080 --> 02:32.440
not necessarily give vibrations.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.920
But in the human beings also,

02:35.080 --> 02:38.680
we find there are many people, like you,

02:38.840 --> 02:42.280
who have Chaitanya flowing in them.

02:42.440 --> 02:45.000
But this Chaitanya when it flows,

02:45.160 --> 02:49.840
we just take Shri Ganesha for granted.

02:50.000 --> 02:52.320
We do not understand

02:52.480 --> 02:55.160
that we have to awaken Shri Ganesha within us.

02:55.320 --> 02:59.360
Means what? What we have to do?

02:59.520 --> 03:04.520
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in you

03:04.680 --> 03:07.960
and as I said that innocence cannot be lost,

03:08.160 --> 03:11.920
so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal child,

03:12.080 --> 03:16.600
He cannot be lost and He cannot be destroyed.

03:16.760 --> 03:18.640
So He’s all the time there.

03:18.800 --> 03:24.920
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering

03:25.080 --> 03:32.760
the great personality of innocence.

03:32.920 --> 03:37.280
But it is always there present.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.080
So now, what should we do

03:42.240 --> 03:46.960
to keep this Ganesha all the time shining within us?

03:47.080 --> 03:51.720
Is to first remember that you were made in the same pattern

03:51.880 --> 03:55.520
as Shri Ganesh.

03:58.120 --> 04:03.200
But His Kundalini is on His stomach;

04:03.360 --> 04:06.360
His pure desire is on His stomach.

04:06.520 --> 04:08.480
It’s very significant to understand

04:08.640 --> 04:16.480
why it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

04:18.560 --> 04:23.320
That means He does not have to conquer

04:23.480 --> 04:28.040
the temptations of Mooladhara at all.

04:30.600 --> 04:34.400
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach,

04:34.560 --> 04:42.680
that means He is also beyond the temptations of food,

04:42.840 --> 04:50.440
of power or anything

04:50.600 --> 04:55.800
because His stomach represents

04:55.960 --> 05:01.040
absolute abandonment, absolute freedom.

05:01.200 --> 05:05.280
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…

05:05.440 --> 05:08.440
these days there is a big fashion that you cannot have a big belly.

05:08.600 --> 05:16.240
I mean this is becoming a big, not only fashion, but a big business.

05:16.880 --> 05:21.040
But as age grows, you have to have it.

05:21.200 --> 05:26.800
Even small children have that and they look so sweet.

05:26.960 --> 05:30.880
Those people who are very thin must understand

05:31.040 --> 05:34.760
that they might be getting some prizes

05:34.920 --> 05:38.880
in the maybe beauty contest or something,

05:39.040 --> 05:46.960
but they do not have that majesty,

05:47.160 --> 05:52.080
that royalty, that dignity in them

05:52.240 --> 05:54.680
as they should have.

05:54.840 --> 05:58.320
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

05:58.480 --> 06:05.040
He has a head with a trunk.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.680
He accepts it.

06:07.840 --> 06:10.720
Of course, is important, He should have that.

06:10.880 --> 06:13.960
Because head of the elephant suggests

06:14.120 --> 06:16.440
that He is not like a human being

06:16.600 --> 06:19.280
who develops ego, superego, conditionings, but

06:19.440 --> 06:25.960
He is just all the time one with the Divine.

06:26.800 --> 06:30.080
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,

06:30.240 --> 06:31.440
He accepts His ears,

06:31.600 --> 06:36.160
He accepts everything that He is made of.

06:36.320 --> 06:40.400
He doesn’t aspire to something

06:40.560 --> 06:43.720
some entrepreneurs put some ideas

06:43.880 --> 06:48.200
and He wouldn’t go run after them.

06:48.360 --> 06:50.760
He won’t try to change Himself;

06:50.920 --> 06:55.240
He won’t try to create that fashion and all that.

06:55.400 --> 06:59.720
He is what He is.

07:03.480 --> 07:08.800
Because He is a satisfied soul.

07:10.480 --> 07:15.040
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,

07:15.200 --> 07:21.640
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri Ganesha.

07:25.720 --> 07:30.040
When you have all the powers within you,

07:30.200 --> 07:33.280
you know you are powerful,

07:33.440 --> 07:37.720
then you don’t hanker after all these things

07:38.160 --> 07:42.680
and you don’t try to make a position

07:42.840 --> 07:45.600
or an impression of others.

07:45.760 --> 07:49.360
For example, He would never go and read books like

07:49.520 --> 07:53.200
how to impress people.

07:54.000 --> 07:56.640
Very common.

07:59.360 --> 08:06.840
So now, as you are created in the same image of Shri Ganesh,

08:06.960 --> 08:09.120
you have to understand that you have to accept

08:09.280 --> 08:12.280
whatever God has given you,

08:13.320 --> 08:14.720
whatever position He has given you.

08:14.880 --> 08:17.640
Same with Christ.

08:17.800 --> 08:22.880
Christ accepted His father who was just a carpenter.

08:23.040 --> 08:25.520
He didn’t aspire for something higher

08:25.680 --> 08:28.600
or some sort of a special position

08:28.760 --> 08:31.400
or a power because He was so powerful

08:31.560 --> 08:34.640
what more power can He have?

08:40.040 --> 08:42.440
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at Him

08:42.600 --> 08:47.680
and could not accept what He was saying,

08:48.800 --> 08:52.280
but still He was self-contented,

08:52.440 --> 08:54.360
self-satisfied.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.880
He knew what it was.

08:57.040 --> 09:00.000
So, for a Sahaja Yogi

09:00.160 --> 09:05.520
first thing is to be self-contented.

09:07.080 --> 09:10.480
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western life is

09:10.640 --> 09:14.640
to see and to be seen.

09:19.400 --> 09:22.480
Both things were missing completely

09:22.640 --> 09:27.000
in the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.840
So when I say these things, suddenly people start thinking,

09:32.000 --> 09:35.280
“Let us become hippies,

09:35.440 --> 09:37.360
or let them become punks,

09:37.520 --> 09:39.800
or let us become this, let us become that.”

09:39.960 --> 09:42.440
You don’t have to become anything. Whatever you have

09:42.600 --> 09:47.920
your body, your face, your hair, everything is there,

09:48.080 --> 09:51.880
just meant for you.

09:53.840 --> 10:00.400
You don’t have to change anything outwardly

10:02.200 --> 10:08.480
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

10:08.640 --> 10:16.120
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

10:16.280 --> 10:24.280
Though there were so many clouds on His being,

10:25.400 --> 10:29.160
though many people insulted Him,

10:29.320 --> 10:33.720
tortured Him, hanged Him, crucified Him,

10:33.880 --> 10:38.360
still the Eternal Being didn’t bother.

10:39.760 --> 10:43.880
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja Yogi

10:44.000 --> 10:46.720
is to accept,

10:47.920 --> 10:53.040
go on accepting things.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.760
But when I say accept, I must say the other side also:

10:56.920 --> 11:01.160
that doesn’t mean you start accepting bhoots,

11:01.320 --> 11:03.280
all the bad qualities of others.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.080
“Mother, You said you must accept”,

11:05.240 --> 11:09.040
so they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

11:09.200 --> 11:14.440
“What’s wrong? You have said it already.”

11:14.600 --> 11:19.240
Whatever I say has another side, always.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.760
Like I said, “Now you have become your own Guru.”

11:21.920 --> 11:26.080
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

11:30.480 --> 11:34.360
Like this, you see,

11:34.520 --> 11:37.720
we go on diverting ourselves,

11:37.880 --> 11:40.720
deviating ourselves from reality

11:40.880 --> 11:44.200
just to cheat ourselves.

11:44.360 --> 11:48.800
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

11:49.680 --> 11:54.240
We have no wisdom because we do not know what is for our benevolence,

11:54.400 --> 11:56.120
what is for our good,

11:56.280 --> 11:57.840
what we should do for our good.

11:57.960 --> 12:02.000
and even if we know, we don’t want to do it.

12:02.480 --> 12:05.160
So, what we lack is wisdom.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.480
That’s a vicious circle, I must say,

12:07.640 --> 12:10.440
that Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

12:10.600 --> 12:14.880
He is the giver of wisdom,

12:15.040 --> 12:18.440
He is the giver of wisdom

12:18.600 --> 12:21.240
and He has to give you the wisdom,

12:21.400 --> 12:23.000
He is to be awakened;

12:23.160 --> 12:27.520
but you are not wise because He is not awakened.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.440
It’s a very vicious circle.

12:31.640 --> 12:35.200
How to make this vicious circle break?

12:35.360 --> 12:42.240
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

12:42.400 --> 12:48.400
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

12:50.280 --> 12:55.920
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

12:56.080 --> 13:05.560
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

13:07.960 --> 13:15.880
That’s the point where you could see yourself, introspection,

13:16.920 --> 13:20.440
which I have seen among Russians.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.880
Just introspect:

13:24.040 --> 13:27.280
“Why do I do like that?

13:27.440 --> 13:30.640
Why cannot I meditate?

13:30.800 --> 13:35.040
Am I going to miss out?

13:35.200 --> 13:43.360
Why can I not do something that is good for me?”

13:43.520 --> 13:46.640
Introspection is the only way

13:46.800 --> 13:50.280
you can see yourself

13:50.440 --> 13:54.520
how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

13:56.360 --> 14:00.120
Even, I have seen, when I say something

14:00.280 --> 14:06.600
in general, people always,  the mind is very clever

14:06.760 --> 14:08.840
think that I am talking about somebody else,

14:08.960 --> 14:11.600
not about them.

14:12.120 --> 14:15.280
It’s a convex mind, convex,

14:16.240 --> 14:19.480
which never receives anything inside itself

14:19.640 --> 14:22.240
because there is no wisdom.

14:25.280 --> 14:28.360
If you are wise,

14:29.120 --> 14:32.200
then not only that you’ll accept

14:32.360 --> 14:35.720
but you’ll understand and it will penetrate

14:35.880 --> 14:41.600
into your attention through your central nervous system.

14:41.760 --> 14:46.240
You just know that this is it.

14:48.040 --> 14:52.280
Now you know that you put your hand towards this candle,

14:52.440 --> 14:54.480
it… you’ll… your fingers might burn.

14:54.640 --> 14:58.240
You know it definitely, with experience,

14:58.400 --> 15:01.240
and you won’t do that.

15:01.400 --> 15:02.920
With experience you have learnt

15:03.080 --> 15:07.520
not to put your hand on to the candle.

15:08.640 --> 15:13.560
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to tell you that.

15:14.280 --> 15:18.680
But this is a new life you have started, a spiritual life.

15:18.840 --> 15:21.640
When you are going into the spiritual life,

15:21.800 --> 15:25.560
try to remember your experiences,

15:25.960 --> 15:27.520
one after another:

15:27.680 --> 15:30.640
how you got transformed, how you changed,

15:30.800 --> 15:34.480
how many the bad things that you had disappeared gradually

15:34.640 --> 15:39.280
and how you have become so nice.

15:40.520 --> 15:46.080
This will take away your depression, to begin with.

15:46.240 --> 15:50.720
Then you should think that, “What do I have to do further?

15:50.880 --> 15:55.640
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

15:56.840 --> 15:58.520
There are lots of stages between

15:58.680 --> 16:01.800
absolute stupidity and absolute wisdom,

16:01.960 --> 16:04.120
and you see all those shades all over,

16:04.280 --> 16:10.120
and combinations and permutations of these I see every day.

16:12.800 --> 16:17.200
And I am surprised that

16:17.360 --> 16:22.360
after getting your Self Realization,

16:22.520 --> 16:27.400
when Shri Ganesha is shining in your attention,

16:27.680 --> 16:32.720
you should see your reflection clearly and try to correct it.

16:34.480 --> 16:37.200
Only this much wisdom if you have that,

16:37.360 --> 16:41.760
“I have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll do it.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.960
I know of somebody who would never get up in the mornings,

16:48.120 --> 16:50.440
say for example.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.680
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock in the morning

16:54.840 --> 16:56.320
I was surprised.

16:56.480 --> 16:59.280
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline

16:59.440 --> 17:03.520
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready to go somewhere.

17:03.680 --> 17:05.560
I said, “Where are you going?”

17:05.720 --> 17:06.640
“You don’t know?”

17:06.800 --> 17:08.800
I said, “What?”

17:10.200 --> 17:13.680
“I have got a job now

17:13.840 --> 17:16.760
and I have to be present at 8 o’clock

17:16.920 --> 17:19.720
and it will take two hours to reach that place.

17:19.880 --> 17:22.360
Also, I am keeping some margin. So I have to leave now.

17:22.520 --> 17:24.680
I can’t talk to You even.”

17:24.840 --> 17:27.920
Quite alert, awake.

17:29.920 --> 17:33.880
Now, what is the thing is

17:34.040 --> 17:42.040
as far as money is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.640
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.200
Money wisdom is quite a lot,

17:52.600 --> 17:57.640
job wisdom is quite a lot.

17:57.800 --> 18:03.720
Because these things means prestige in the society,

18:03.880 --> 18:09.600
this means security in the society.

18:10.360 --> 18:13.840
So this kind of business you find in many people

18:14.000 --> 18:18.400
and in some even that is missing.

18:18.560 --> 18:22.600
They don’t even understand that they have to earn their living.

18:22.760 --> 18:26.360
But that’s the minimum,

18:27.760 --> 18:31.760
you cannot be parasite.

18:31.920 --> 18:36.240
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages, is this:

18:36.400 --> 18:41.040
that we are not for money, money is for us.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.600
The attention if it is on your Spirit,

18:51.760 --> 18:54.960
on the Ganesha Principle,

18:57.280 --> 19:03.080
then whole situation will change.

19:03.800 --> 19:07.360
Your priorities will change.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.120
And suddenly people will say,

19:11.280 --> 19:13.200
“Mother, what has happened to this gentleman?

19:13.360 --> 19:18.440
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such a wise person.”

19:24.800 --> 19:29.880
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have minimum wisdom already there.
