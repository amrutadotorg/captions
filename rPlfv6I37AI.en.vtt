00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:21.960
Today is the happiest day for all of you,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.640
for the whole universe,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800
because Shri Ganesha was created.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.800
He was created to emit auspiciousness

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.400
through His Chaitanya [Divine Vibrations].

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.440
First, the whole cosmos was filled

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.640
with this Chaitanyasrishti [creation of Divine Vibrations].

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.480
Then Brahmadeva came into play,

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.360
and He created all the matter.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.480
But the greatest blessings

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.400
of the Divine Power

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.280
was to symbolize Chaitanya,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:42.840
and this Chaitanya has many aspects,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.000
but specially in Shri Ganesha,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.720
it is auspiciousness.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:55.120
In these modern times people have lost the sense of auspiciousness.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:02:00.960
Everything that emits vibrations, Chaitanya, is auspicious,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:09.760
is shubh, and whatever does not is not by any chance auspicious.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.760
So first of all, whatever you worship,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.560
whatever you accept,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.120
all of them have to be auspicious things.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.200
Every shape has a coefficience

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.920
and all these shapes which you see,

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.440
not necessarily give vibrations.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.920
But in the human beings also,

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.680
we find there are many people, like you,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.280
who have Chaitanya flowing in them.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.000
But this Chaitanya when it flows,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.840
we just take Shri Ganesha for granted.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.320
We do not understand

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.160
that we have to awaken Shri Ganesha within us.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:59.360
Means what? What we have to do?

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.520
There is Shri Ganesha already existing in you

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.960
and as I said that innocence cannot be lost,

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.920
so Shri Ganesha is eternal being, eternal child,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.600
He cannot be lost and He cannot be destroyed.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.640
So He’s all the time there.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.920
Maybe some clouds of your ill doings are covering

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:32.760
the great personality of innocence.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.280
But it is always there present.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.080
So now, what should we do

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.960
to keep this Ganesha all the time shining within us?

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.720
Is to first remember that you were made in the same pattern

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.520
as Shri Ganesh.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.200
But His Kundalini is on His stomach;

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.360
His pure desire is on His stomach.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:08.480
It’s very significant to understand

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:16.480
why it is there that His Kundalini is on His stomach.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:23.320
That means He does not have to conquer

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.040
the temptations of Mooladhara at all.

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.400
But He has His Kundalini on His stomach,

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:42.680
that means He is also beyond the temptations of food,

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:50.440
of power or anything

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.800
because His stomach represents

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.040
absolute abandonment, absolute freedom.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.280
He’s not bothered as to how He looks that…

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:08.440
these days there is a big fashion that you cannot have a big belly.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:16.240
I mean this is becoming a big, not only fashion, but a big business.

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.040
But as age grows, you have to have it.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.800
Even small children have that and they look so sweet.

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.880
Those people who are very thin must understand

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.760
that they might be getting some prizes

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:38.880
in the maybe beauty contest or something,

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:46.960
but they do not have that majesty,

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.080
that royalty, that dignity in them

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.680
as they should have.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.320
So Shri Ganesha accepts everything.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:05.040
He has a head with a trunk.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:07.680
He accepts it.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.720
Of course, is important, He should have that.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.960
Because head of the elephant suggests

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.440
that He is not like a human being

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:19.280
who develops ego, superego, conditionings, but

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.960
He is just all the time one with the Divine.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.080
He accepts His body, He accepts His head,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.440
He accepts His ears,

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.160
He accepts everything that He is made of.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.400
He doesn’t aspire to something

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.720
some entrepreneurs put some ideas

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:48.200
and He wouldn’t go run after them.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.760
He won’t try to change Himself;

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.240
He won’t try to create that fashion and all that.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:59.720
He is what He is.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.800
Because He is a satisfied soul.

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:15.040
The Kundalini on the stomach shows a complete,

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:21.640
self-contented, satisfied personality of Shri Ganesha.

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.040
When you have all the powers within you,

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:33.280
you know you are powerful,

00:07:33.440 --> 00:07:37.720
then you don’t hanker after all these things

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:42.680
and you don’t try to make a position

00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.600
or an impression of others.

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:49.360
For example, He would never go and read books like

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.200
how to impress people.

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.640
Very common.

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:06.840
So now, as you are created in the same image of Shri Ganesh,

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.120
you have to understand that you have to accept

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:12.280
whatever God has given you,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.720
whatever position He has given you.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.640
Same with Christ.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.880
Christ accepted His father who was just a carpenter.

00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.520
He didn’t aspire for something higher

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.600
or some sort of a special position

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.400
or a power because He was so powerful

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.640
what more power can He have?

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.440
Though people mocked at Him and laughed at Him

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.680
and could not accept what He was saying,

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.280
but still He was self-contented,

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:54.360
self-satisfied.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.880
He knew what it was.

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.000
So, for a Sahaja Yogi

00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:05.520
first thing is to be self-contented.

00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:10.480
As I told you, the fundamentals of the western life is

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.640
to see and to be seen.

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:22.480
Both things were missing completely

00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.000
in the incarnation of Shri Ganesh.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.840
So when I say these things, suddenly people start thinking,

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.280
“Let us become hippies,

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.360
or let them become punks,

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.800
or let us become this, let us become that.”

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:42.440
You don’t have to become anything. Whatever you have

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:47.920
your body, your face, your hair, everything is there,

00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:51.880
just meant for you.

00:09:53.840 --> 00:10:00.400
You don’t have to change anything outwardly

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:08.480
because inside is complete Chaitanya.

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:16.120
Shri Ganesha never tried to change Himself.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:24.280
Though there were so many clouds on His being,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.160
though many people insulted Him,

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.720
tortured Him, hanged Him, crucified Him,

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.360
still the Eternal Being didn’t bother.

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:43.880
So the first and foremost thing for a Sahaja Yogi

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.720
is to accept,

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:53.040
go on accepting things.

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:56.760
But when I say accept, I must say the other side also:

00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:01.160
that doesn’t mean you start accepting bhoots,

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:03.280
all the bad qualities of others.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:05.080
“Mother, You said you must accept”,

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:09.040
so they’ll start accepting all these bad qualities.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.440
“What’s wrong? You have said it already.”

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:19.240
Whatever I say has another side, always.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.760
Like I said, “Now you have become your own Guru.”

00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:26.080
So, “Why should we listen to anybody else?”

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.360
Like this, you see,

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:37.720
we go on diverting ourselves,

00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:40.720
deviating ourselves from reality

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:44.200
just to cheat ourselves.

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.800
And this comes because we have no wisdom.

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:54.240
We have no wisdom because we do not know what is for our benevolence,

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:56.120
what is for our good,

00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.840
what we should do for our good.

00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.000
and even if we know, we don’t want to do it.

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:05.160
So, what we lack is wisdom.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:07.480
That’s a vicious circle, I must say,

00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.440
that Ganesha is to be awakened to give you wisdom

00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:14.880
He is the giver of wisdom,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.440
He is the giver of wisdom

00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:21.240
and He has to give you the wisdom,

00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.000
He is to be awakened;

00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.520
but you are not wise because He is not awakened.

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:30.440
It’s a very vicious circle.

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:35.200
How to make this vicious circle break?

00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:42.240
That “Let my wisdom shine in my attention.

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:48.400
Let Shri Ganesha throw His light in my attention.”

00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:55.920
Mentally you people are very alert, no doubt.

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:05.560
And you can always cheat yourself nicely.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:15.880
That’s the point where you could see yourself, introspection,

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.440
which I have seen among Russians.

00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.880
Just introspect:

00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:27.280
“Why do I do like that?

00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:30.640
Why cannot I meditate?

00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.040
Am I going to miss out?

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:43.360
Why can I not do something that is good for me?”

00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:46.640
Introspection is the only way

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.280
you can see yourself

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:54.520
how far you are from Shri Ganesh.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:00.120
Even, I have seen, when I say something

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:06.600
in general, people always,  the mind is very clever

00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:08.840
think that I am talking about somebody else,

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:11.600
not about them.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.280
It’s a convex mind, convex,

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:19.480
which never receives anything inside itself

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.240
because there is no wisdom.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.360
If you are wise,

00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:32.200
then not only that you’ll accept

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:35.720
but you’ll understand and it will penetrate

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:41.600
into your attention through your central nervous system.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:46.240
You just know that this is it.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:52.280
Now you know that you put your hand towards this candle,

00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:54.480
it… you’ll… your fingers might burn.

00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:58.240
You know it definitely, with experience,

00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:01.240
and you won’t do that.

00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:02.920
With experience you have learnt

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:07.520
not to put your hand on to the candle.

00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:13.560
And this wisdom is there, I don’t have to tell you that.

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.680
But this is a new life you have started, a spiritual life.

00:15:18.840 --> 00:15:21.640
When you are going into the spiritual life,

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:25.560
try to remember your experiences,

00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.520
one after another:

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:30.640
how you got transformed, how you changed,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.480
how many the bad things that you had disappeared gradually

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:39.280
and how you have become so nice.

00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:46.080
This will take away your depression, to begin with.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.720
Then you should think that, “What do I have to do further?

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:55.640
Am I really wise, or I’m stupid?”

00:15:56.840 --> 00:15:58.520
There are lots of stages between

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.800
absolute stupidity and absolute wisdom,

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.120
and you see all those shades all over,

00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:10.120
and combinations and permutations of these I see every day.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:17.200
And I am surprised that

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:22.360
after getting your Self Realization,

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:27.400
when Shri Ganesha is shining in your attention,

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.720
you should see your reflection clearly and try to correct it.

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:37.200
Only this much wisdom if you have that,

00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.760
“I have to work out my benevolence”, you’ll do it.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:47.960
I know of somebody who would never get up in the mornings,

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:50.440
say for example.

00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:54.680
But one day I saw him ready at about six o’clock in the morning

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.320
I was surprised.

00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:59.280
How this gentleman who has no self-discipline

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:03.520
has suddenly got up at six o’clock and ready to go somewhere.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.560
I said, “Where are you going?”

00:17:05.720 --> 00:17:06.640
“You don’t know?”

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:08.800
I said, “What?”

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:13.680
“I have got a job now

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.760
and I have to be present at 8 o’clock

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.720
and it will take two hours to reach that place.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.360
Also, I am keeping some margin. So I have to leave now.

00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:24.680
I can’t talk to You even.”

00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.920
Quite alert, awake.

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:33.880
Now, what is the thing is

00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:42.040
as far as money is concerned, lot of wisdom is there.

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.640
Don’t have to tell them, that is automatically.

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:51.200
Money wisdom is quite a lot,

00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.640
job wisdom is quite a lot.

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:03.720
Because these things means prestige in the society,

00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:09.600
this means security in the society.

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.840
So this kind of business you find in many people

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:18.400
and in some even that is missing.

00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:22.600
They don’t even understand that they have to earn their living.

00:18:22.760 --> 00:18:26.360
But that’s the minimum,

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.760
you cannot be parasite.

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:36.240
Then the second stage, as I said by many stages, is this:

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:41.040
that we are not for money, money is for us.

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.600
The attention if it is on your Spirit,

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.960
on the Ganesha Principle,

00:18:57.280 --> 00:19:03.080
then whole situation will change.

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.360
Your priorities will change.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.120
And suddenly people will say,

00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:13.200
“Mother, what has happened to this gentleman?

00:19:13.360 --> 00:19:18.440
He was a stupid fool, now he has become such a wise person.”

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:29.880
So to awaken Shri Ganesha you should have minimum wisdom already there.
