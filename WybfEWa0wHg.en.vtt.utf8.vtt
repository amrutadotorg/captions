00:00:41.211 --> 00:00:48.386
Sahaja Yoga means: "Saha" means "with"; "ja" means "born with".

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:52.527
So it is a right; every human being has got

00:00:52.687 --> 00:00:57.879
to be in union -that is Yoga- with the Divine Power.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:03.229
And it's within yourself "Sahaj", born with you, spontaneous.

00:01:03.404 --> 00:01:06.589
Explain to us what is Kundalini?

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:13.581
Kundalini as I told you it's a reflection of the Primordial Mother within us.

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:18.138
And she is individually everybody' mother.

00:01:18.298 --> 00:01:21.171
Now she's anxious to give you your second birth

00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:28.120
When she's awakened in the sacrum bone she rises upward and

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.431
crosses through six centres, pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:35.750
and reaches a point

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.473
where you get connected connected to All-pervading Power.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:44.248
It's like- you can say that it's like a

00:01:44.408 --> 00:01:47.081
cord you have to connect to the mains.

00:01:47.241 --> 00:01:52.236
So, unless and until you are connected to your mains, you do not know what you are!

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:57.161
Once you are connected then you start knowing that you are the Spirit.

00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:01.977
In the same way, it rises when it is awakened- very simple.

00:02:02.137 --> 00:02:06.957
But for that, you have to have somebody who has, who has the authority

00:02:07.117 --> 00:02:09.529
to raise it; a spiritual authority.

00:02:09.689 --> 00:02:14.290
Supposing tomorrow if you get your Realization, you can do it also.

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:22.974
What is the relationships between Kundalini and Goddess Athena and Mother Mary?

00:02:23.213 --> 00:02:27.913
Now "ata", "ata" means, in Sanscrit language, "primordial".

00:02:28.073 --> 00:02:33.511
So, according to us Athena Athena was the Primordial Mother

00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:37.566
and Kundalini is the reflection of the Primordial Mother

00:02:37.726 --> 00:02:40.836
whom we call as Adi Shakti in Sanscrit language.

00:02:40.996 --> 00:02:45.786
And Mother Mary is one of the forms of Athena,

00:02:45.946 --> 00:02:51.160
one of the forms of of this Adi Shakti, the Primordial Mother.

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.440
How they awakening of Kundalini cures incurable diseases?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.886
This is the energy which of course in Greece was

00:03:03.046 --> 00:03:06.794
the bone was called as sacrum, meaning the sacred bone,

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:11.517
and the sacrum bone contains this energy within ourselves,

00:03:11.677 --> 00:03:13.840
known as Kundalini.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.313
That means the Greeks knew about it.

00:03:16.473 --> 00:03:22.545
And then when she rises, she passes through your subtle centres, there are six

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:27.804
above the Kundalini, and whilst she nourishes those centres

00:03:27.964 --> 00:03:32.472
and also connects you to the All-pervading Power with is the vital power.

00:03:32.632 --> 00:03:37.686
So first of all, she nourishes those centres that's how you get cured

00:03:37.846 --> 00:03:40.390
physically, mentally, emotionally.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.179
All our problems come from human beings

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:46.939
and the human beings' problems come from their centres.

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:52.003
So if these centres are nourished, they're alright. That is how it works.

00:03:52.163 --> 00:03:55.229
And then it connects to this All-pervading Power

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.177
which we call as the Divine power

00:03:58.337 --> 00:04:02.767
which does all the living work like these flowers; everything come from that.

00:04:02.927 --> 00:04:04.887
So all the time it is flowing within us.

00:04:05.047 --> 00:04:10.010
 So we don't get sick, we don't feel tired, we don't get old.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:14.774
May this philosophy offers solutions to our society's problems

00:04:14.934 --> 00:04:17.520
and create a better or a new world?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.733
Yes, of course because what's wrong with us, I just now told you,

00:04:21.893 --> 00:04:25.429
is all these problems coming from human beings

00:04:25.589 --> 00:04:28.719
because they are ignorant and they are blind.

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:33.233
But once they get the light, they become like angels.

00:04:33.393 --> 00:04:37.510
And when all these angels will come back, then, there will be no problem.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:44.197
All our society is ruined because we have no idea to the aim of our life.

00:04:44.357 --> 00:04:48.959
The aim of our life is to become the Spirit, to have the Self-knowledge.

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:52.442
And once you have Self-knowledge, you are surprised to see

00:04:52.602 --> 00:04:58.016
how dignified you are and how glorious you are within yourself.

00:04:58.176 --> 00:05:01.274
Once you discover that,
all these things drop out

00:05:01.434 --> 00:05:05.127
and you become a wonderful person. And also about others,

00:05:05.287 --> 00:05:10.278
because also you develop a new awareness a new dimension

00:05:10.438 --> 00:05:12.922
which we call as Collective Consciousness

00:05:13.082 --> 00:05:15.835
by which you can feel the centres of others

00:05:15.995 --> 00:05:20.466
Now, if you know how to cure these
centres, you can cure others also.

00:05:20.626 --> 00:05:21.059
Thank you.

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.219
May God bless you.
