WEBVTT

00:28.325 --> 00:36.675
The Madonna in the light of Sahaja Yoga

00:55.436 --> 01:02.659
Yogini: Mother, Brian and I were also
talking, it was the same day, about Mary

01:02.860 --> 01:09.860
and I was saying to Brian about the Goddess
type of thing

01:10.061 --> 01:18.732
and I said to Brian that I wondered whether
Mary would have been, a form of the Goddess.

01:18.933 --> 01:28.265
Shri Mataji: Of course, She is Mahalakshmi.
And She was, the Incarnation of Mahalakshmi

01:28.466 --> 01:34.371
of a very high level at the Agnya chakra.
It’s a very big thing.

01:35.753 --> 01:40.644
So She has arisen out of the sea,

01:40.845 --> 01:46.509
so She is Miriam, you can call Her. She is
Marie, She is Marie.

01:46.710 --> 01:55.910
That’s why Christ’s Mother’s name was Mary
because She came out of the sea.

01:56.126 --> 01:59.746
People, I don’t know if they think about
it - why She was called Mary

01:59.947 --> 02:03.652
of all the things. Why this name Mary?

02:05.431 --> 02:14.198
Now, this power which came out of the sea,

02:14.595 --> 02:19.015
because the whole thing, the seeking started
in the sea first of all, as you know.

02:19.216 --> 02:25.607
It had to be in the sea because first
the animals were born in the sea only.

02:27.406 --> 02:36.142
Today is a great day when we are celebrating
Mahalakshmi’s Puja.

02:36.736 --> 02:42.861
You must be knowing that today is the day
of Mary,

02:43.062 --> 02:46.902
Mother of Christ, who was Mahalakshmi.

02:47.679 --> 02:53.107
In the beginning Mahalakshmi principle
incarnated on this earth

02:53.324 --> 02:57.720
as the wife of Shri Rama – Shri Sita.

02:59.411 --> 03:05.946
Then came the second incarnation at the time
of Shri Krishna as Radha,

03:06.423 --> 03:11.281
‘Ra’ is energy, ‘dha’ is the one which
sustains.

03:11.804 --> 03:18.794
And then came the incarnation
of Mahalakshmi, is the Mother of Christ.

03:18.995 --> 03:27.918
The Christianity has failed because they
did not recognise the powers of Mary.

03:30.223 --> 03:37.669
According to Sahaja Yoga, She was
the incarnation of Mahalakshmi

03:37.870 --> 03:48.825
and She’s the one who sacrificed Her Son
for the sake of religion.

03:49.026 --> 03:56.498
But unfortunately, nobody understood
Her value.

03:56.699 --> 04:04.341
Nobody saw that She was such a great
spiritual personality.

04:04.542 --> 04:09.246
Only through Sahaja Yoga you can understand
that She was

04:09.447 --> 04:18.000
a very great personality who gave birth
to Christ.

04:19.409 --> 04:24.517
Like when I told people that Christ’s Mother
was the Holy Spirit,

04:24.718 --> 04:27.808
they would not accept it. In India they
said, “What did She do?

04:28.009 --> 04:30.781
She just used to cry and weep, but the Holy
Spirit is supposed

04:30.982 --> 04:34.443
to give Realization to people, She didn’t
give realization to anyone”.

04:34.644 --> 04:38.901
But She was. So how do you find out?
You put your hands

04:39.102 --> 04:44.771
towards Me and ask the question, “Mother,
was She the Holy Spirit?”.

04:46.560 --> 04:49.199
Then why didn’t Christ say that She was
the Holy Spirit?

04:49.400 --> 04:50.961
The question comes in.

04:51.580 --> 04:55.021
Christ’s Mother was Herself an incarnation
of that,

04:55.222 --> 04:59.345
but it was not mentioned in the Bible
because if these Romans or Jews

04:59.546 --> 05:07.444
had known that She is the One, they would
have cut Her into pieces and attacked Her.

05:07.652 --> 05:14.819
So, it was not said because Christ had
to play this drama of crucifixion.

05:15.142 --> 05:20.010
But you can find out after your Realization
through your vibratory awareness

05:20.211 --> 05:24.070
that whatever I’m saying about them is
absolute truth.

05:25.758 --> 05:29.441
There's so much can be said about this
Mahalakshmi Tattwa;

05:29.642 --> 05:31.742
you are all blessed so much by that.

05:31.943 --> 05:41.690
And so today we remember Her great
incarnation as Maria, who was very great

05:41.891 --> 05:46.334
because She had to bear terrible pain
in Her heart

05:46.535 --> 05:52.456
with all Her powers that She had. She was
a tremendously powerful Lady.

05:52.657 --> 06:02.700
But despite that, She bore all the tortures
of Christ upon Her heart.

06:02.901 --> 06:11.534
And it was Her order and Her desire that
Christ has to crucify Himself

06:11.739 --> 06:15.080
so that people could be resurrected.

06:15.348 --> 06:18.196
And sometimes Indians asked Me what did
She do

06:18.397 --> 06:20.766
to be a Mahalakshmi, what did She achieve?

06:20.967 --> 06:27.341
I said, "With all Her powers to bear it.
To play the drama it must be too much."

06:29.472 --> 06:33.511
He (Hanumana) is an angel as you know,
according to Christian,

06:33.712 --> 06:40.069
we should say, according to Bible, that
He is the angel called Gabriel.

06:41.426 --> 06:48.111
Now, Gabriel is the one who brought
the message, because He’s always a messenger,

06:48.312 --> 06:53.281
to Maria and is surprisingly the words He
used were,

06:53.473 --> 06:58.493
“Immaculata Salve”. That’s My name.

06:58.678 --> 07:02.667
My first name is Nirmala, means Immaculata
and surname is Salve.

07:02.868 --> 07:04.553
He said those words to Her.

07:05.459 --> 07:10.157
So Maria has to do quite a lot with
Hanumana all Her life.

07:10.358 --> 07:15.586
That means Maria is the Mahalakshmi.
Mahalakshmi being the Sita,

07:15.787 --> 07:21.323
Sita, then Radha, Hanumana has to be there
to serve Her.

07:23.320 --> 07:29.542
Now imagine Hanumana as Gabriel, had to go

07:29.743 --> 07:39.957
and tell Maria that there’s a Child which
is the incarnation.

07:40.158 --> 07:48.183
"The Savior is going to be born to you."
She was a young virgin.

07:48.384 --> 07:57.489
To break such a news which was horrible,
compared to the conditionings of those days.

07:57.690 --> 08:05.779
He did it. “I have to do it, so I’ll do it.
If that’s the order, I’ll do it.”

08:08.248 --> 08:12.963
People have started talking against

08:14.119 --> 08:21.654
Mary by saying that there was something
wrong, “How could a virgin get a child?”

08:22.818 --> 08:27.284
Because we do not understand it is God,

08:28.072 --> 08:33.240
and in the area of God anything is
possible.

08:34.138 --> 08:42.640
They’re above all these things and they can
create anything,

08:44.176 --> 08:54.689
and in anyway Ganesha had to be born out
of a virgin because He was so pure.

08:57.156 --> 09:01.163
People may say that they can't believe
in immaculate birth of Christ.

09:01.364 --> 09:03.693
They cannot believe in the conception
of Christ.

09:03.894 --> 09:08.728
I mean, it's easy for people to say,
"We don't believe."

09:09.141 --> 09:14.530
What do they know about God? What do they
know about His mysterious ways of doing it?

09:14.731 --> 09:21.804
Can you say how you convert or you
transform a flower into a fruit?

09:22.005 --> 09:27.238
You don't know anything about living
miracles

09:27.439 --> 09:32.000
and you start doubting the Immaculate
Conception.

09:34.440 --> 09:43.728
So much so today that they are making
a film showing Mary to be a prostitute.

09:43.947 --> 09:47.483
I mean, this is where you have ended up.

09:47.684 --> 09:51.114
In India even if you say this they’ll beat
you nicely -

09:51.315 --> 09:55.333
anyone, whether Muslim, Hindu, Christian.

09:56.524 --> 10:01.102
I mean, is shocking to hear that the way
they talk about Christ here.

10:01.303 --> 10:04.695
I mean, to an Indian it gives a shock.
How can you talk

10:04.896 --> 10:09.707
because once you give up your chastity

10:09.908 --> 10:18.779
you cannot understand that there can be
someone who is absolutely chaste.

10:18.980 --> 10:22.800
For a thief everybody is a thief.

10:26.021 --> 10:29.957
Because you don’t have that respect for
your chastity

10:30.158 --> 10:34.334
you cannot imagine what Christ could have
been.

10:34.535 --> 10:38.350
You cannot imagine, you cannot accept it.

10:40.967 --> 10:46.169
Unbearable things are said about Christ.
I tell you, unbearable, I don’t know.

10:46.370 --> 10:53.944
I’ve faced His crucifixion, which was
unbearable as it was.

10:54.856 --> 10:59.824
She (Mary) passed through the greatest
ordeal to see Her son being crucified

11:00.025 --> 11:05.935
but She knew what was the purpose of His
crucifixion and She accepted.

11:06.920 --> 11:10.509
I can’t see a cross,

11:10.710 --> 11:14.063
if somebody is wearing a cross I said,
“Take out cross!“,

11:14.479 --> 11:20.406
because the message of Christ is
resurrection and not crucifixion.

11:21.625 --> 11:27.096
But perhaps the Christians, specially Paul
must have thought

11:27.297 --> 11:32.271
that he should use cross to feel, to make
everybody feel guilty.

11:32.924 --> 11:36.119
And he (Paul) gave his own color
to Christianity and they,

11:36.296 --> 11:41.736
really the way he talked about Christ,
His Mother and all that,

11:41.937 --> 11:47.164
was such that nobody can say definitely
that they were Divine personalities.

11:47.349 --> 11:52.218
He also didn’t like to talk about
the Immaculate Conception which was a fact,

11:52.419 --> 11:57.840
and Thomas ran away from there because
he was surprised

11:58.041 --> 12:02.738
the way he (Paul) was trying to twist
everything to his advantage.

12:02.939 --> 12:07.019
And he came down to Egypt where he wrote
all his treatise

12:07.220 --> 12:10.690
and put them in a jar there, and then he
came to India.

12:10.867 --> 12:13.609
Now about fifty years back they have
discovered that jar,

12:13.810 --> 12:18.861
and found it out; it’s known as the Gnostic
knowledge.

12:19.062 --> 12:22.977
He used to call them Gnostics, ‘Gn’ word
means knowledge

12:23.178 --> 12:28.130
as you people are Gnostics, ‘those who
know’, you see.

12:28.331 --> 12:34.345
Not mentally but you know it, on your
central nervous system.

12:36.487 --> 12:47.532
In that book (of Thomas), Mary is telling
them about knowledge,

12:47.733 --> 12:52.415
but this Paul objects to it,

12:52.616 --> 12:58.176
and She says that this is what you have
to achieve.

12:58.377 --> 13:02.323
But he doesn't want to, he is arguing with
Her.

13:02.524 --> 13:13.662
But then Thomas said that what Christ has
said on the Cross, "Behold the Mother."

13:15.390 --> 13:21.652
“She is the Mother of Christ and how dare
you insult Her?”

13:21.853 --> 13:31.956
But just the opposite, Paul never respected
women, so he appointed...

13:32.823 --> 13:41.600
I mean, he called Her as just a woman.
No respect. For Mahalakshmi, no respect!

13:42.522 --> 13:50.475
In the Bible there is the God Almighty

13:50.676 --> 13:56.534
as the Father God, and we have the Son God.

13:57.040 --> 14:04.426
And the Trinity, the third one is the Holy
Ghost.

14:05.386 --> 14:11.766
But how can you have Father and the Son,
and no Mother?

14:12.209 --> 14:18.698
The women are called as “second citizen”

14:18.890 --> 14:24.615
because they say that She was not

14:24.816 --> 14:32.197
on the table of the twelve apostles, who
were having the Last Supper.

14:32.398 --> 14:38.873
But then how do you have Paul there, who
was not sitting on the supper table also?

14:39.074 --> 14:46.061
But people could feel the Mother of Christ
as a Goddess,

14:46.262 --> 14:48.874
so they called Her as a Madonna.

14:49.270 --> 15:00.540
And I can’t understand, those who do not
want Her as the Goddess

15:00.741 --> 15:06.047
go and worship Her as Black Madonna
in Poland.

15:07.513 --> 15:09.935
Mother is missing, She is a dove,

15:10.136 --> 15:14.562
not in Greece, in Greece Athena is
the primordial Mother.

15:14.747 --> 15:22.668
In India She is the Adi Shakti, also in
England She was the white Goddess.

15:22.869 --> 15:28.823
She was, she was not mentioned
as Madonna but as a woman.

15:29.429 --> 15:32.342
Big controversies.

15:34.355 --> 15:40.642
Madonna is accepted by people who are
faithful.

15:41.319 --> 15:47.854
So they named Her Madonna and that’s how
this Mother Mary was called as Madonna -

15:48.055 --> 15:50.524
means maiden, means virgin.

15:50.725 --> 15:57.107
And this Madonna was then started occupying
the place

15:57.308 --> 16:06.017
of churches, everywhere and people regarded
Her as a Goddess.

16:06.218 --> 16:09.841
It is the people who said, not in the Bible,
not in the Christianity,

16:10.042 --> 16:15.341
but the people started calling Her Madonna
and from that Madonna level

16:15.542 --> 16:22.578
that people started seeing the Mother
and the motherhood.

16:22.779 --> 16:28.849
She was Mahalakshmi. We know that very well
and we worship Her as Mahalakshmi.

16:30.315 --> 16:38.143
And even now the attention of all
the people is on what Christ said,

16:38.344 --> 16:45.820
or Mother Mary has said it, and which has
come through these horrible people to us.

16:47.292 --> 16:55.031
So to learn about other Deities and other
great Incarnations, you neutralise this.

16:55.232 --> 16:58.054
You must try to neutralise this too much
attention

16:58.255 --> 17:02.443
by learning about other Deities, say,
Shri Ganesha.

17:02.644 --> 17:06.509
If you talk about Shri Ganesha, He is
the essence of Christ.

17:06.710 --> 17:10.940
You understand it. Ganesha is the essence
of Christ,

17:11.141 --> 17:15.651
and Christ is the manifestation of
Shri Ganesha’s powers.

17:15.852 --> 17:20.598
So, if you go to the essence of most
things, you see, that's better.

17:21.610 --> 17:24.385
So there is no religion to be given up.

17:24.586 --> 17:28.638
On the contrary, you have to enlighten
the religion and enlighten others.

17:28.839 --> 17:32.512
All of you could be Sahaja Yogis and could
be anything,

17:32.713 --> 17:38.718
because there's nothing like Christ hanging
there somewhere and Mary hanging there.

17:38.954 --> 17:43.634
No, they are part and parcel of the Whole.
They are there.

17:43.835 --> 17:48.296
You cannot just take them out. And there
cannot be many religions,

17:48.497 --> 17:52.063
there can be only one religion, that's
a human religion

17:52.264 --> 17:56.157
which makes you higher personalities, makes
you grow.

17:56.358 --> 18:00.065
So you don't have to give up anything, but
you yourself won't do many things,

18:00.266 --> 18:05.733
yourself won't do many things because you'll
understand whatever is living is living,

18:05.934 --> 18:10.700
that's what you'll start following. We have
in our prayers all the prayers,

18:10.901 --> 18:15.041
Jew prayers and Christian prayers and Hindu
prayers

18:15.242 --> 18:18.945
and all the prayers of all the religions
because they are all mantras,

18:19.146 --> 18:23.496
they are all the chantings, and they are
so important for different chakras.

18:23.697 --> 18:28.341
So you see, your universality also gets
aware

18:28.542 --> 18:35.060
of your own being, expressed in different,
these great Deities.

18:35.261 --> 18:38.348
They are within us and They are awakened
and you are surprised.

18:40.988 --> 18:44.844
So we have now three principles
of Mahalakshmi that we have seen.

18:45.045 --> 18:48.549
And the fourth one is Myself.

18:53.158 --> 18:59.793
Mine is a much deeper work,

18:59.994 --> 19:06.441
much wider and tremendous patience
is needed.

19:07.066 --> 19:16.127
It won't work out if I sacrifice anyone.
I have to sacrifice Myself.

19:16.328 --> 19:20.465
I have to sacrifice My family, so-called.

19:20.666 --> 19:26.536
I have to sacrifice My sleep, sacrifice
comforts,

19:26.752 --> 19:31.916
everything possible under the sun I have
to sacrifice for one reason:

19:32.117 --> 19:38.726
that your Mahalakshmi Tattwa should be
manifested. It should have its fruits.

19:41.027 --> 19:44.696
In the same way I bless you with all
the Lakshmi principle

19:44.897 --> 19:50.071
and Mahalakshmi principle but above all
the principle of love,

19:50.272 --> 19:54.630
the pure love without any expectations,
nirvaj.

19:54.831 --> 19:59.641
I bless you all on this auspicious day.
May God bless you!

19:59.842 --> 20:03.782
Have wisdom and understand that Mother has
said it out of Her heart,

20:03.983 --> 20:08.561
out of Her love, out of Her feelings
for us.

20:08.762 --> 20:12.205
May God bless you! Thank you very much.
