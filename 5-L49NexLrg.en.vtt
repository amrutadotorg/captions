00:14.549 --> 00:15.549
Try to Become Aware

00:15.549 --> 00:16.549
Shrirampur, India, 21 December 1989

00:30.462 --> 00:32.772
Please move backwards.

00:33.639 --> 00:38.632
Move backwards, those who haven’t got space please move backwards, be sensible.

00:39.592 --> 00:48.423
You all can see Me very well and those who
are far away are closer to Me; is a fact.

01:02.363 --> 01:06.205
When I say the truth, the Vishnumaya is there.

01:10.566 --> 01:12.340
Please be seated.

01:20.246 --> 01:21.245
Hello.

01:22.376 --> 01:23.795
Uska kya naam?

01:24.106 --> 01:25.765
Jenny, you go that side.

01:25.796 --> 01:27.305
Don’t sit with men.

01:28.526 --> 01:30.543
Must keep a discipline on yourself.

01:30.566 --> 01:33.853
Those who are sitting here please move to
the left.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.603
Keep a distance.

01:36.477 --> 01:41.968
Now, you are such great Sahaja Yogis, ancient
Sahaja Yogis.

01:42.708 --> 01:47.086
People look forward to you for discipline
and sense.

01:50.129 --> 01:53.099
Mostly those who are very new try to come
forward.

01:53.079 --> 01:54.349
I’ve seen that.

01:54.789 --> 01:59.109
I can understand if you are a leader if you
are sitting in front.

01:59.169 --> 02:02.739
But otherwise what is the need to sit in front?

02:03.179 --> 02:04.589
Good.

02:05.909 --> 02:07.399
Please be seated.

02:10.935 --> 02:14.275
The further you are, you will feel more vibrations.

02:14.405 --> 02:17.275
You can; for this you can testify.

02:17.855 --> 02:20.417
The closer you are you’ll feel less.

02:23.397 --> 02:24.897
That’s My trick.

02:28.700 --> 02:55.766
[Hindi]

03:00.416 --> 03:04.156
Now see, are you feeling more vibrations there?

03:04.526 --> 03:06.926
Jenny, there, see yourself.

03:09.706 --> 03:10.926
All right?

03:13.746 --> 03:15.516
I never tell lies.

03:17.902 --> 03:19.772
I’ll have some water.

03:21.292 --> 03:32.301
[Hindi]

03:36.640 --> 03:39.140
No, no, why don’t you have a proper
seat?

03:39.592 --> 03:44.252
[Hindi]

03:46.481 --> 03:48.922
You better have a seat.

03:49.551 --> 03:55.417
[Hindi]

28:58.075 --> 29:03.145
I’ve been telling them about something
which you need not know.

29:03.529 --> 29:06.285
I hope you didn’t understand.

29:09.925 --> 29:15.126
Sometimes I have to speak in English when
I want them not to know anything about you.

29:15.895 --> 29:17.906
It’s quite mutual.

29:18.385 --> 29:24.370
All right, so I’m sorry for this delay but
it so happened that they never told Me anything.

29:24.475 --> 29:27.560
I didn’t know that is such a beautiful place
is here.

29:27.635 --> 29:32.848
Otherwise I would never have taken you down
there for any problem because actually this

29:32.854 --> 29:35.388
is the one that’s also a problem.

29:35.504 --> 29:43.326
God willing Me, we may buy this place.

29:58.172 --> 30:07.183
So I must praise you for your patience and
for your sweetness about it that delays do

30:07.213 --> 30:11.523
not matter as long as we have the Pujas.

30:11.523 --> 30:19.312
I hope you all have rested very well and your
stomach must be also resting a little bit

30:19.312 --> 30:24.883
because you had a very severe type of an attack
of people who wanted to feed you and it was

30:24.883 --> 30:29.413
too much starting from Aurangabad to this
place.

30:29.413 --> 30:34.973
This is good once in a while to allow your
stomach to rest.

30:34.973 --> 30:44.013
Now, I don’t know what to tell you because
as it is you know that we have big plans,

30:44.013 --> 30:50.613
when we, and when I say “we” I mean the
Paramchaitanya and all the deities put together,

30:50.613 --> 30:53.193
to expand Sahaja Yoga.

30:53.193 --> 30:56.872
It’s not necessary how many things you give
Me.

30:56.872 --> 30:58.553
It’s not necessary at all.

30:58.553 --> 31:02.783
It’s not necessary how many of us are there.

31:02.783 --> 31:08.553
What's more important is how many people you
give realization to.

31:08.553 --> 31:11.283
And secondly, how are you?

31:11.283 --> 31:13.203
Have you evolved?

31:13.203 --> 31:23.233
Have you really become independent and you
can get rid of all your conditionings, your

31:23.233 --> 31:24.233
ego?

31:24.233 --> 31:27.833
And have you become a very mild, beautiful,
compassionate, collective personality?

31:27.833 --> 31:35.633
So it’s a question of introspection, seeing
ourselves.

31:35.633 --> 31:39.473
It’s very important.

31:39.473 --> 31:42.443
If we do not have a proper car we cannot drive.

31:42.443 --> 31:50.613
In the same way if our being is in a funny
situation then you cannot ascend; that’s

31:50.613 --> 31:51.613
a fact.

31:51.613 --> 32:06.403
So we have to understand that the amount we
enjoy everything is the sign how much we have

32:06.403 --> 32:10.643
achieved.

32:10.643 --> 32:15.243
If there’s a little cup then a very little
joy can go into it.

32:15.243 --> 32:19.353
But if there’s a large cup it gets much
more joy in it.

32:19.353 --> 32:25.123
But if it is like an ocean all the rivers
of joys fall into it.

32:25.123 --> 32:28.433
So it is the amount of enjoyment you have.

32:28.433 --> 32:31.463
Not fun, I mean enjoyment.

32:31.463 --> 32:38.183
I’m not saying frivolousness, cheapishness,
but a very majestic, deep enjoyment that you

32:38.183 --> 32:44.683
have within yourself, which just bubbles into
you, makes you very happy, and you don’t

32:44.683 --> 32:49.593
know why you are happy, just enjoying your
happiness.

32:49.593 --> 32:54.663
Then one has to say that you have really become
a Sahaja Yogi.

32:54.663 --> 32:56.803
And then, at that stage you want to share
it.

32:56.803 --> 32:58.372
Don’t you keep it to yourself.

32:58.372 --> 33:02.902
You’ll work very hard, do everything that
is possible under the sun.

33:02.902 --> 33:09.323
Your mind will think how to spread it, how
to give this joy to others.

33:09.323 --> 33:13.733
You won’t be happy unless and until you
communicate with others.

33:13.733 --> 33:21.692
So first you become the capitalist and then
you become a communist.

33:21.692 --> 33:26.643
So first thing is how far we are enjoying.

33:26.643 --> 33:33.972
Second is what have we got in our mind now,
how are we going to expand Sahaja Yoga outside.

33:33.972 --> 33:39.752
First, the light has to improve and automatically
the light has to spread.

33:39.752 --> 33:45.613
What is the relationships we have with ourselves,
which I have told you before also, don’t

33:45.613 --> 33:46.613
form groups.

33:46.613 --> 33:49.483
This is the country; that is the country.

33:49.483 --> 33:56.062
I would request you to change the buses and
put different people into the buses and let

33:56.062 --> 34:04.103
us see if they reach in one piece or not or
there is a big quarrel and a fight.

34:04.103 --> 34:09.673
If there is any quarrel or argument then drop
that person on the way and let him come by

34:09.673 --> 34:12.282
another bus.

34:12.282 --> 34:20.823
We don’t want argumentative spoiled sports
with us.

34:20.823 --> 34:23.712
So just put them on the ground, I tell you.

34:23.712 --> 34:28.173
And it’s a, it’s definitely, you must
know that I am telling you in the presence

34:28.173 --> 34:34.682
of everyone, anybody who is difficult just
ask him to get down here, “Please be here.

34:34.682 --> 34:39.622
Some bus will be coming and take you.”

34:39.622 --> 34:43.342
So try to find out who are the spoiled sports.

34:43.342 --> 34:47.573
Another thing is some people have developed
a habit of moving their neck a bit too much.

34:47.573 --> 34:50.423
Even in singing they move their neck so much,
then their body.

34:50.423 --> 34:53.312
You can move your body but not the neck.

34:53.312 --> 34:55.303
Neck should be moved with the body.

34:55.303 --> 34:57.263
Yesterday I had a problem with My liver.

34:57.263 --> 35:00.483
Then I thought you all have livers.

35:00.483 --> 35:04.402
But then it was Vishuddhi and Vishuddhi must
have come from the way you people move your

35:04.402 --> 35:05.402
neck.

35:05.402 --> 35:08.513
Like if you say, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.”

35:08.513 --> 35:14.163
Or if you don’t want to say also, if I’m
saying anything you’ll go on like this,

35:14.163 --> 35:15.163
nodding.

35:15.163 --> 35:16.163
So don’t do all these things.

35:16.163 --> 35:17.163
That spoils your Vishuddhi.

35:17.163 --> 35:23.582
As it is you have bad Vishuddhis, thanks to
this Roman Catholic Church and the other church

35:23.582 --> 35:25.942
which just talks.

35:25.942 --> 35:32.883
So please try to keep your neck in line with
your body all the time and even if you have

35:32.883 --> 35:38.043
to move, move very slightly your neck, not
with jerks, and don’t go on nodding.

35:38.043 --> 35:41.524
While music time I’ve seen many people do
not move their body.

35:41.524 --> 35:47.603
But if you see the Indians, they move their
body.

35:47.603 --> 35:51.672
So this is one of a very small thing but is
important because your Vishuddhis have to

35:51.672 --> 35:52.782
be all right.

35:52.782 --> 35:55.192
There should be no problem on your Vishuddhis.

35:55.192 --> 36:01.532
For liver also, there are some people I see
still with liver who are very thin people.

36:01.532 --> 36:12.122
They should be asked to stand in the water
for one hour and clear out themselves.

36:12.122 --> 36:14.592
If you are very thin, be sure it is not a
normal thing.

36:14.592 --> 36:17.603
It is not natural.

36:17.603 --> 36:20.312
It is abnormal to be very thin.

36:20.312 --> 36:26.323
So work it out ‒ it’s all your liver ‒ and
later on you can have a session of checking

36:26.323 --> 36:28.532
yourselves somewhere sitting.

36:28.532 --> 36:33.082
Before meditation you can check yourselves
what is wrong with you before My photograph

36:33.082 --> 36:35.842
and then you should go into meditation.

36:35.842 --> 36:40.514
So now we are here on a pilgrimage to achieve
a higher state of awareness.

36:40.514 --> 36:45.612
Awareness is the main point, you should be
absolutely aware.

36:45.612 --> 36:54.073
As we were coming, I just said, “Now, this
is wrong road.”

36:54.073 --> 36:55.413
They said, “How do you know Mother?”

36:55.413 --> 36:57.502
I said, “Just I know.

36:57.502 --> 37:00.362
Just find out.”

37:00.362 --> 37:05.413
Just to know everything you need not do anything
about it.

37:05.413 --> 37:08.932
But that is the sign that you have become
very aware.

37:08.932 --> 37:16.663
To be aware of everything, it is not like
sitting down here that you should say, “Oh,

37:16.663 --> 37:18.053
it’s very beautiful.

37:18.053 --> 37:19.913
Oh, it’s very grand.”

37:19.913 --> 37:25.153
That’s not the point ‒ not to certify,
not to criticize ‒ but how much do you know.

37:25.153 --> 37:29.433
Feel it in the atmosphere.

37:29.433 --> 37:36.373
Because we have a very big brain and we have
two loops in our head, is not one brain but

37:36.373 --> 37:37.512
two loops.

37:37.512 --> 37:47.673
And when the awareness starts giving you light
you start knowing within yourself everything

37:47.673 --> 37:51.723
and you are silent.

37:51.723 --> 38:01.023
You don’t have to assert, manipulate or
to exert yourself but just to know.

38:01.023 --> 38:05.103
And that’s a very beautiful thing one has
to do.

38:05.103 --> 38:11.803
Those people who do not feel vibrations must
feel their vibrations in these two.

38:11.803 --> 38:16.202
They have to feel their vibrations in these
two.

38:16.202 --> 38:23.372
And those who are still complaining about
their troubles and stomachs and livers and

38:23.372 --> 38:34.863
this and that should get treated immediately
and get well.

38:34.863 --> 38:40.312
Another thing which I can tell you which is
very important that in India you must comb

38:40.312 --> 38:43.853
you properly because they think you are all
beggars.

38:43.853 --> 38:46.363
Only the beggars have hair like this.

38:46.363 --> 38:49.403
Please put oil and make your hair properly.

38:49.403 --> 38:52.822
They’ll not have any respect for you.

38:52.822 --> 38:56.963
You must have properly combed hair, groomed
hair.

38:56.963 --> 39:00.632
Otherwise they think you are something mad,
or you are hippies or something gone wrong

39:00.632 --> 39:01.632
with you.

39:01.632 --> 39:03.903
They don’t appreciate this fashion.

39:03.903 --> 39:10.882
Please make your hair properly, absolutely
in a proper way as they used to do.

39:10.882 --> 39:16.872
When we saw your western pictures when we
were young, they all were very well-groomed

39:16.872 --> 39:17.872
people.

39:17.872 --> 39:24.273
Now suddenly this fashion stupid has come
to make you all bald-headed and then to sell

39:24.273 --> 39:28.572
their ‒ what you call them ‒ wigs.

39:28.572 --> 39:31.332
So this stupid idea is wrong.

39:31.332 --> 39:37.853
Will you please now see that your hair are
properly groomed and not to have any hair

39:37.853 --> 39:40.002
on your, this thing.

39:40.002 --> 39:43.663
It’s a sign of stupidity in this country.

39:43.663 --> 39:48.503
Anybody has, who has hair on the forehead
it’s a sign of stupidity.

39:48.503 --> 39:54.822
We call it as “giprya”.

39:54.822 --> 39:56.853
I asked Neeta what is the fashion now.

39:56.853 --> 39:59.202
She told Me in Marathi it is “giprya”.

39:59.202 --> 40:06.353
“Giprya” means a person who gets mad or
lunatic as the hair, hair you see like that.

40:06.353 --> 40:09.382
At least we Sahaja Yogis should not follow
such stupid fashions.

40:09.382 --> 40:13.463
They now take out hair like this, you see.

40:13.463 --> 40:20.582
I just don’t know, like moustaches coming
out of the head.

40:20.582 --> 40:24.103
You should be proud of your forehead.

40:24.103 --> 40:28.343
It’s the Ekadesha.

40:28.343 --> 40:34.313
You have to fight the whole world with this
Ekadesha of yours.

40:34.313 --> 40:41.543
So please see that you keep your forehead
absolutely open, hair properly done and oily.

40:41.543 --> 40:42.543
That will also soothe you.

40:42.543 --> 40:46.082
In the night you can put some oil and it will
soothe you.

40:46.082 --> 40:50.182
You’ll find it very much better; specially
for liver patient is very important.

40:50.182 --> 40:54.853
They must put oil in their heads because they
are dried out people.

40:54.853 --> 40:58.413
There’s no fat in their hair and the hair
do not grow.

40:58.413 --> 41:05.202
They become immediately bald as soon as they
achieve twenty-five to thirty years of age.

41:05.202 --> 41:11.283
I don’t want to have bald-headed Sahaja
Yogis.

41:11.283 --> 41:17.773
Otherwise you’ll have to wear the [shadings]
like the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

41:17.773 --> 41:24.832
If you make such clownish appearances I’m
worried about you because you don’t see

41:24.832 --> 41:27.873
the point what I am trying to make.

41:27.873 --> 41:33.903
Look after your hair; it’s very important.

41:33.903 --> 41:44.892
All right, now last but not the least is a
request that we are here for meditation.

41:44.892 --> 41:48.262
Though we may sleep late I always get up at
four o’clock.

41:48.262 --> 41:50.803
Whatever time you may sleep, get up at four
o’clock, do your meditation.

41:50.803 --> 41:53.062
You can go after to sleep again.

41:53.062 --> 41:57.923
But that’s the best time to get up, have
your baths, whatever way you want, or wash

41:57.923 --> 42:01.692
yourself and just go for meditation.

42:01.692 --> 42:03.442
And then you can sleep off again.

42:03.442 --> 42:06.733
That time you will find you will be quite
alert and awake.

42:06.733 --> 42:09.813
It’s not so difficult.

42:09.813 --> 42:12.903
You’ll all be awakened.

42:12.903 --> 42:14.442
I will awaken you.

42:14.442 --> 42:20.023
But please see that you get up in the morning,
do your meditation from four to five and then

42:20.023 --> 42:24.733
go off to sleep.

42:24.733 --> 42:28.452
We have to write a book about the Sahaj culture.

42:28.452 --> 42:31.413
But it is going to come out of you people.

42:31.413 --> 42:37.063
If I write something then I am manipulating
you, I’m trying to tell you, but you have

42:37.063 --> 42:40.473
to write something yourself.

42:40.473 --> 42:44.503
You have to bring out what is Sahaj culture
is.

42:44.503 --> 42:50.033
You are already manifesting it without My
telling you now.

42:50.033 --> 42:55.103
So what is the Sahaj culture, how we work
it out, ourselves, our things ‒ I don’t

42:55.103 --> 42:58.773
tell you all these things into details.

42:58.773 --> 43:06.372
Also, try to judge where is your attention,
what are you doing about your attention.

43:06.372 --> 43:09.903
All the time keep an attention on your attention.

43:09.903 --> 43:12.072
Where is my attention?

43:12.072 --> 43:16.642
Mr. Attention, where are you lost?

43:16.642 --> 43:18.252
And that will work out for you.

43:18.252 --> 43:20.353
So now for today it’s sufficient.

43:20.353 --> 43:26.093
Already we are very late and I hope My lecture
doesn’t go over your heads or on the sides

43:26.093 --> 43:27.153
of your ears.

43:27.153 --> 43:32.734
It should go inside and you should record
it and whatever I am saying it’s very important.

43:33.103 --> 43:35.283
May God bless you all.

43:39.623 --> 43:42.520
[Hindi]

44:09.079 --> 44:13.589
Will you please polish those things some time
and show them?

44:14.549 --> 44:15.549
All right.

44:16.629 --> 44:17.959
[Hindi]

44:18.299 --> 44:22.839
All the small children can come ‒ up to
ten years.
