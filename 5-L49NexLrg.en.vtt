00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:15.549
Try to Become Aware

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:16.549
Shrirampur, India, 21 December 1989

00:00:30.462 --> 00:00:32.772
Please move backwards.

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:38.632
Move backwards, those who haven’t got space please move backwards, be sensible.

00:00:39.592 --> 00:00:48.423
You all can see Me very well and those who
are far away are closer to Me; is a fact.

00:01:02.363 --> 00:01:06.205
When I say the truth, the Vishnumaya is there.

00:01:10.566 --> 00:01:12.340
Please be seated.

00:01:20.246 --> 00:01:21.245
Hello.

00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:23.795
Uska kya naam?

00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:25.765
Jenny, you go that side.

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:27.305
Don’t sit with men.

00:01:28.526 --> 00:01:30.543
Must keep a discipline on yourself.

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.853
Those who are sitting here please move to
the left.

00:01:33.886 --> 00:01:35.603
Keep a distance.

00:01:36.477 --> 00:01:41.968
Now, you are such great Sahaja Yogis, ancient
Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:47.086
People look forward to you for discipline
and sense.

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:53.099
Mostly those who are very new try to come
forward.

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:54.349
I’ve seen that.

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.109
I can understand if you are a leader if you
are sitting in front.

00:01:59.169 --> 00:02:02.739
But otherwise what is the need to sit in front?

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.589
Good.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.399
Please be seated.

00:02:10.935 --> 00:02:14.275
The further you are, you will feel more vibrations.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.275
You can; for this you can testify.

00:02:17.855 --> 00:02:20.417
The closer you are you’ll feel less.

00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:24.897
That’s My trick.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:55.766
[Hindi]

00:03:00.416 --> 00:03:04.156
Now see, are you feeling more vibrations there?

00:03:04.526 --> 00:03:06.926
Jenny, there, see yourself.

00:03:09.706 --> 00:03:10.926
All right?

00:03:13.746 --> 00:03:15.516
I never tell lies.

00:03:17.902 --> 00:03:19.772
I’ll have some water.

00:03:21.292 --> 00:03:32.301
[Hindi]

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.140
No, no, why don’t you have a proper
seat?

00:03:39.592 --> 00:03:44.252
[Hindi]

00:03:46.481 --> 00:03:48.922
You better have a seat.

00:03:49.551 --> 00:03:55.417
[Hindi]

00:28:58.075 --> 00:29:03.145
I’ve been telling them about something
which you need not know.

00:29:03.529 --> 00:29:06.285
I hope you didn’t understand.

00:29:09.925 --> 00:29:15.126
Sometimes I have to speak in English when
I want them not to know anything about you.

00:29:15.895 --> 00:29:17.906
It’s quite mutual.

00:29:18.385 --> 00:29:24.370
All right, so I’m sorry for this delay but
it so happened that they never told Me anything.

00:29:24.475 --> 00:29:27.560
I didn’t know that is such a beautiful place
is here.

00:29:27.635 --> 00:29:32.848
Otherwise I would never have taken you down
there for any problem because actually this

00:29:32.854 --> 00:29:35.388
is the one that’s also a problem.

00:29:35.504 --> 00:29:43.326
God willing Me, we may buy this place.

00:29:58.172 --> 00:30:07.183
So I must praise you for your patience and
for your sweetness about it that delays do

00:30:07.213 --> 00:30:11.523
not matter as long as we have the Pujas.

00:30:11.523 --> 00:30:19.312
I hope you all have rested very well and your
stomach must be also resting a little bit

00:30:19.312 --> 00:30:24.883
because you had a very severe type of an attack
of people who wanted to feed you and it was

00:30:24.883 --> 00:30:29.413
too much starting from Aurangabad to this
place.

00:30:29.413 --> 00:30:34.973
This is good once in a while to allow your
stomach to rest.

00:30:34.973 --> 00:30:44.013
Now, I don’t know what to tell you because
as it is you know that we have big plans,

00:30:44.013 --> 00:30:50.613
when we, and when I say “we” I mean the
Paramchaitanya and all the deities put together,

00:30:50.613 --> 00:30:53.193
to expand Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:53.193 --> 00:30:56.872
It’s not necessary how many things you give
Me.

00:30:56.872 --> 00:30:58.553
It’s not necessary at all.

00:30:58.553 --> 00:31:02.783
It’s not necessary how many of us are there.

00:31:02.783 --> 00:31:08.553
What's more important is how many people you
give realization to.

00:31:08.553 --> 00:31:11.283
And secondly, how are you?

00:31:11.283 --> 00:31:13.203
Have you evolved?

00:31:13.203 --> 00:31:23.233
Have you really become independent and you
can get rid of all your conditionings, your

00:31:23.233 --> 00:31:24.233
ego?

00:31:24.233 --> 00:31:27.833
And have you become a very mild, beautiful,
compassionate, collective personality?

00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:35.633
So it’s a question of introspection, seeing
ourselves.

00:31:35.633 --> 00:31:39.473
It’s very important.

00:31:39.473 --> 00:31:42.443
If we do not have a proper car we cannot drive.

00:31:42.443 --> 00:31:50.613
In the same way if our being is in a funny
situation then you cannot ascend; that’s

00:31:50.613 --> 00:31:51.613
a fact.

00:31:51.613 --> 00:32:06.403
So we have to understand that the amount we
enjoy everything is the sign how much we have

00:32:06.403 --> 00:32:10.643
achieved.

00:32:10.643 --> 00:32:15.243
If there’s a little cup then a very little
joy can go into it.

00:32:15.243 --> 00:32:19.353
But if there’s a large cup it gets much
more joy in it.

00:32:19.353 --> 00:32:25.123
But if it is like an ocean all the rivers
of joys fall into it.

00:32:25.123 --> 00:32:28.433
So it is the amount of enjoyment you have.

00:32:28.433 --> 00:32:31.463
Not fun, I mean enjoyment.

00:32:31.463 --> 00:32:38.183
I’m not saying frivolousness, cheapishness,
but a very majestic, deep enjoyment that you

00:32:38.183 --> 00:32:44.683
have within yourself, which just bubbles into
you, makes you very happy, and you don’t

00:32:44.683 --> 00:32:49.593
know why you are happy, just enjoying your
happiness.

00:32:49.593 --> 00:32:54.663
Then one has to say that you have really become
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:54.663 --> 00:32:56.803
And then, at that stage you want to share
it.

00:32:56.803 --> 00:32:58.372
Don’t you keep it to yourself.

00:32:58.372 --> 00:33:02.902
You’ll work very hard, do everything that
is possible under the sun.

00:33:02.902 --> 00:33:09.323
Your mind will think how to spread it, how
to give this joy to others.

00:33:09.323 --> 00:33:13.733
You won’t be happy unless and until you
communicate with others.

00:33:13.733 --> 00:33:21.692
So first you become the capitalist and then
you become a communist.

00:33:21.692 --> 00:33:26.643
So first thing is how far we are enjoying.

00:33:26.643 --> 00:33:33.972
Second is what have we got in our mind now,
how are we going to expand Sahaja Yoga outside.

00:33:33.972 --> 00:33:39.752
First, the light has to improve and automatically
the light has to spread.

00:33:39.752 --> 00:33:45.613
What is the relationships we have with ourselves,
which I have told you before also, don’t

00:33:45.613 --> 00:33:46.613
form groups.

00:33:46.613 --> 00:33:49.483
This is the country; that is the country.

00:33:49.483 --> 00:33:56.062
I would request you to change the buses and
put different people into the buses and let

00:33:56.062 --> 00:34:04.103
us see if they reach in one piece or not or
there is a big quarrel and a fight.

00:34:04.103 --> 00:34:09.673
If there is any quarrel or argument then drop
that person on the way and let him come by

00:34:09.673 --> 00:34:12.282
another bus.

00:34:12.282 --> 00:34:20.823
We don’t want argumentative spoiled sports
with us.

00:34:20.823 --> 00:34:23.712
So just put them on the ground, I tell you.

00:34:23.712 --> 00:34:28.173
And it’s a, it’s definitely, you must
know that I am telling you in the presence

00:34:28.173 --> 00:34:34.682
of everyone, anybody who is difficult just
ask him to get down here, “Please be here.

00:34:34.682 --> 00:34:39.622
Some bus will be coming and take you.”

00:34:39.622 --> 00:34:43.342
So try to find out who are the spoiled sports.

00:34:43.342 --> 00:34:47.573
Another thing is some people have developed
a habit of moving their neck a bit too much.

00:34:47.573 --> 00:34:50.423
Even in singing they move their neck so much,
then their body.

00:34:50.423 --> 00:34:53.312
You can move your body but not the neck.

00:34:53.312 --> 00:34:55.303
Neck should be moved with the body.

00:34:55.303 --> 00:34:57.263
Yesterday I had a problem with My liver.

00:34:57.263 --> 00:35:00.483
Then I thought you all have livers.

00:35:00.483 --> 00:35:04.402
But then it was Vishuddhi and Vishuddhi must
have come from the way you people move your

00:35:04.402 --> 00:35:05.402
neck.

00:35:05.402 --> 00:35:08.513
Like if you say, “Yes, yes, yes, yes.”

00:35:08.513 --> 00:35:14.163
Or if you don’t want to say also, if I’m
saying anything you’ll go on like this,

00:35:14.163 --> 00:35:15.163
nodding.

00:35:15.163 --> 00:35:16.163
So don’t do all these things.

00:35:16.163 --> 00:35:17.163
That spoils your Vishuddhi.

00:35:17.163 --> 00:35:23.582
As it is you have bad Vishuddhis, thanks to
this Roman Catholic Church and the other church

00:35:23.582 --> 00:35:25.942
which just talks.

00:35:25.942 --> 00:35:32.883
So please try to keep your neck in line with
your body all the time and even if you have

00:35:32.883 --> 00:35:38.043
to move, move very slightly your neck, not
with jerks, and don’t go on nodding.

00:35:38.043 --> 00:35:41.524
While music time I’ve seen many people do
not move their body.

00:35:41.524 --> 00:35:47.603
But if you see the Indians, they move their
body.

00:35:47.603 --> 00:35:51.672
So this is one of a very small thing but is
important because your Vishuddhis have to

00:35:51.672 --> 00:35:52.782
be all right.

00:35:52.782 --> 00:35:55.192
There should be no problem on your Vishuddhis.

00:35:55.192 --> 00:36:01.532
For liver also, there are some people I see
still with liver who are very thin people.

00:36:01.532 --> 00:36:12.122
They should be asked to stand in the water
for one hour and clear out themselves.

00:36:12.122 --> 00:36:14.592
If you are very thin, be sure it is not a
normal thing.

00:36:14.592 --> 00:36:17.603
It is not natural.

00:36:17.603 --> 00:36:20.312
It is abnormal to be very thin.

00:36:20.312 --> 00:36:26.323
So work it out ‒ it’s all your liver ‒ and
later on you can have a session of checking

00:36:26.323 --> 00:36:28.532
yourselves somewhere sitting.

00:36:28.532 --> 00:36:33.082
Before meditation you can check yourselves
what is wrong with you before My photograph

00:36:33.082 --> 00:36:35.842
and then you should go into meditation.

00:36:35.842 --> 00:36:40.514
So now we are here on a pilgrimage to achieve
a higher state of awareness.

00:36:40.514 --> 00:36:45.612
Awareness is the main point, you should be
absolutely aware.

00:36:45.612 --> 00:36:54.073
As we were coming, I just said, “Now, this
is wrong road.”

00:36:54.073 --> 00:36:55.413
They said, “How do you know Mother?”

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:57.502
I said, “Just I know.

00:36:57.502 --> 00:37:00.362
Just find out.”

00:37:00.362 --> 00:37:05.413
Just to know everything you need not do anything
about it.

00:37:05.413 --> 00:37:08.932
But that is the sign that you have become
very aware.

00:37:08.932 --> 00:37:16.663
To be aware of everything, it is not like
sitting down here that you should say, “Oh,

00:37:16.663 --> 00:37:18.053
it’s very beautiful.

00:37:18.053 --> 00:37:19.913
Oh, it’s very grand.”

00:37:19.913 --> 00:37:25.153
That’s not the point ‒ not to certify,
not to criticize ‒ but how much do you know.

00:37:25.153 --> 00:37:29.433
Feel it in the atmosphere.

00:37:29.433 --> 00:37:36.373
Because we have a very big brain and we have
two loops in our head, is not one brain but

00:37:36.373 --> 00:37:37.512
two loops.

00:37:37.512 --> 00:37:47.673
And when the awareness starts giving you light
you start knowing within yourself everything

00:37:47.673 --> 00:37:51.723
and you are silent.

00:37:51.723 --> 00:38:01.023
You don’t have to assert, manipulate or
to exert yourself but just to know.

00:38:01.023 --> 00:38:05.103
And that’s a very beautiful thing one has
to do.

00:38:05.103 --> 00:38:11.803
Those people who do not feel vibrations must
feel their vibrations in these two.

00:38:11.803 --> 00:38:16.202
They have to feel their vibrations in these
two.

00:38:16.202 --> 00:38:23.372
And those who are still complaining about
their troubles and stomachs and livers and

00:38:23.372 --> 00:38:34.863
this and that should get treated immediately
and get well.

00:38:34.863 --> 00:38:40.312
Another thing which I can tell you which is
very important that in India you must comb

00:38:40.312 --> 00:38:43.853
you properly because they think you are all
beggars.

00:38:43.853 --> 00:38:46.363
Only the beggars have hair like this.

00:38:46.363 --> 00:38:49.403
Please put oil and make your hair properly.

00:38:49.403 --> 00:38:52.822
They’ll not have any respect for you.

00:38:52.822 --> 00:38:56.963
You must have properly combed hair, groomed
hair.

00:38:56.963 --> 00:39:00.632
Otherwise they think you are something mad,
or you are hippies or something gone wrong

00:39:00.632 --> 00:39:01.632
with you.

00:39:01.632 --> 00:39:03.903
They don’t appreciate this fashion.

00:39:03.903 --> 00:39:10.882
Please make your hair properly, absolutely
in a proper way as they used to do.

00:39:10.882 --> 00:39:16.872
When we saw your western pictures when we
were young, they all were very well-groomed

00:39:16.872 --> 00:39:17.872
people.

00:39:17.872 --> 00:39:24.273
Now suddenly this fashion stupid has come
to make you all bald-headed and then to sell

00:39:24.273 --> 00:39:28.572
their ‒ what you call them ‒ wigs.

00:39:28.572 --> 00:39:31.332
So this stupid idea is wrong.

00:39:31.332 --> 00:39:37.853
Will you please now see that your hair are
properly groomed and not to have any hair

00:39:37.853 --> 00:39:40.002
on your, this thing.

00:39:40.002 --> 00:39:43.663
It’s a sign of stupidity in this country.

00:39:43.663 --> 00:39:48.503
Anybody has, who has hair on the forehead
it’s a sign of stupidity.

00:39:48.503 --> 00:39:54.822
We call it as “giprya”.

00:39:54.822 --> 00:39:56.853
I asked Neeta what is the fashion now.

00:39:56.853 --> 00:39:59.202
She told Me in Marathi it is “giprya”.

00:39:59.202 --> 00:40:06.353
“Giprya” means a person who gets mad or
lunatic as the hair, hair you see like that.

00:40:06.353 --> 00:40:09.382
At least we Sahaja Yogis should not follow
such stupid fashions.

00:40:09.382 --> 00:40:13.463
They now take out hair like this, you see.

00:40:13.463 --> 00:40:20.582
I just don’t know, like moustaches coming
out of the head.

00:40:20.582 --> 00:40:24.103
You should be proud of your forehead.

00:40:24.103 --> 00:40:28.343
It’s the Ekadesha.

00:40:28.343 --> 00:40:34.313
You have to fight the whole world with this
Ekadesha of yours.

00:40:34.313 --> 00:40:41.543
So please see that you keep your forehead
absolutely open, hair properly done and oily.

00:40:41.543 --> 00:40:42.543
That will also soothe you.

00:40:42.543 --> 00:40:46.082
In the night you can put some oil and it will
soothe you.

00:40:46.082 --> 00:40:50.182
You’ll find it very much better; specially
for liver patient is very important.

00:40:50.182 --> 00:40:54.853
They must put oil in their heads because they
are dried out people.

00:40:54.853 --> 00:40:58.413
There’s no fat in their hair and the hair
do not grow.

00:40:58.413 --> 00:41:05.202
They become immediately bald as soon as they
achieve twenty-five to thirty years of age.

00:41:05.202 --> 00:41:11.283
I don’t want to have bald-headed Sahaja
Yogis.

00:41:11.283 --> 00:41:17.773
Otherwise you’ll have to wear the [shadings]
like the Hare Rama Hare Krishna.

00:41:17.773 --> 00:41:24.832
If you make such clownish appearances I’m
worried about you because you don’t see

00:41:24.832 --> 00:41:27.873
the point what I am trying to make.

00:41:27.873 --> 00:41:33.903
Look after your hair; it’s very important.

00:41:33.903 --> 00:41:44.892
All right, now last but not the least is a
request that we are here for meditation.

00:41:44.892 --> 00:41:48.262
Though we may sleep late I always get up at
four o’clock.

00:41:48.262 --> 00:41:50.803
Whatever time you may sleep, get up at four
o’clock, do your meditation.

00:41:50.803 --> 00:41:53.062
You can go after to sleep again.

00:41:53.062 --> 00:41:57.923
But that’s the best time to get up, have
your baths, whatever way you want, or wash

00:41:57.923 --> 00:42:01.692
yourself and just go for meditation.

00:42:01.692 --> 00:42:03.442
And then you can sleep off again.

00:42:03.442 --> 00:42:06.733
That time you will find you will be quite
alert and awake.

00:42:06.733 --> 00:42:09.813
It’s not so difficult.

00:42:09.813 --> 00:42:12.903
You’ll all be awakened.

00:42:12.903 --> 00:42:14.442
I will awaken you.

00:42:14.442 --> 00:42:20.023
But please see that you get up in the morning,
do your meditation from four to five and then

00:42:20.023 --> 00:42:24.733
go off to sleep.

00:42:24.733 --> 00:42:28.452
We have to write a book about the Sahaj culture.

00:42:28.452 --> 00:42:31.413
But it is going to come out of you people.

00:42:31.413 --> 00:42:37.063
If I write something then I am manipulating
you, I’m trying to tell you, but you have

00:42:37.063 --> 00:42:40.473
to write something yourself.

00:42:40.473 --> 00:42:44.503
You have to bring out what is Sahaj culture
is.

00:42:44.503 --> 00:42:50.033
You are already manifesting it without My
telling you now.

00:42:50.033 --> 00:42:55.103
So what is the Sahaj culture, how we work
it out, ourselves, our things ‒ I don’t

00:42:55.103 --> 00:42:58.773
tell you all these things into details.

00:42:58.773 --> 00:43:06.372
Also, try to judge where is your attention,
what are you doing about your attention.

00:43:06.372 --> 00:43:09.903
All the time keep an attention on your attention.

00:43:09.903 --> 00:43:12.072
Where is my attention?

00:43:12.072 --> 00:43:16.642
Mr. Attention, where are you lost?

00:43:16.642 --> 00:43:18.252
And that will work out for you.

00:43:18.252 --> 00:43:20.353
So now for today it’s sufficient.

00:43:20.353 --> 00:43:26.093
Already we are very late and I hope My lecture
doesn’t go over your heads or on the sides

00:43:26.093 --> 00:43:27.153
of your ears.

00:43:27.153 --> 00:43:32.734
It should go inside and you should record
it and whatever I am saying it’s very important.

00:43:33.103 --> 00:43:35.283
May God bless you all.

00:43:39.623 --> 00:43:42.520
[Hindi]

00:44:09.079 --> 00:44:13.589
Will you please polish those things some time
and show them?

00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:15.549
All right.

00:44:16.629 --> 00:44:17.959
[Hindi]

00:44:18.299 --> 00:44:22.839
All the small children can come ‒ up to
ten years.
