00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:15.109
After killing Kansa, He went down
to Dwarika to rule there.

00:00:15.966 --> 00:00:22.363
And there He had to marry five more wives.

00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:28.283
First He had sixteen thousand wives.
So then many people can ask a question,

00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:32.558
“Mother, what sort of a husband
He must be?”

00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:42.152
These sixteen thousand should explain
that He has sixteen petals

00:00:45.458 --> 00:00:52.417
on His domain of Vishuddhi chakra

00:00:54.252 --> 00:01:02.082
and theses sixteen petals, multiplied
by the one thousand petals

00:01:02.797 --> 00:01:06.051
of the Sahastrara become sixteen thousand.

00:01:06.252 --> 00:01:14.074
So these are sixteen thousand powers,
which are available to us also.

00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:22.297
These sixteen thousand powers are working
in the brain.

00:01:25.233 --> 00:01:30.385
These powers could not come
as Sahaja Yogis,

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.456
so they came as women

00:01:34.657 --> 00:01:39.689
who were entrapped by a king – exactly
sixteen thousand –

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:47.935
and He married them because by marriage,
it was all very dharmic.

00:01:48.136 --> 00:01:55.707
Also He married five wives later, who
represented the five elements.

00:01:59.714 --> 00:02:07.154
Incarnations cannot be understood
from human angle –

00:02:07.657 --> 00:02:11.818
can never be understood, I should say –

00:02:13.035 --> 00:02:19.954
because their ways and methods
are different.

00:02:20.991 --> 00:02:24.098
They have ways and methods of their own

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:30.963
and they do not expose them to other
people.

00:02:31.164 --> 00:02:37.606
Not that they are afraid to expose
or they don’t want to expose,

00:02:37.807 --> 00:02:44.821
but it will not be intelligible, it cannot
be understood by human beings.

00:02:45.806 --> 00:02:49.720
If you ask Me a question, say, “Mother,
how do you manage that?”

00:02:49.928 --> 00:02:54.930
I may just change the topic very cleverly.

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:10.885
So now, I am going to tell you about
sixteen thousand petals of the Sahastrara

00:03:11.086 --> 00:03:15.063
and now we can start the translation.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.289
[To the translator: “In gist you can
tell them.”]

00:05:09.287 --> 00:05:15.748
So now, to understand the sixteen thousand
powers that you have got

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:21.345
in your brain, already manifesting:
As soon as you get your Realisation

00:05:21.546 --> 00:05:28.131
those sixteen thousand powers start
manifesting.

00:05:39.497 --> 00:05:54.984
Every petal of Sahastrara has got sixteen
powers.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:14.568
And these are – I mean the petals -
are made of the five elements.

00:06:18.106 --> 00:06:29.194
So these five elements, who create these
one thousand petals,

00:06:34.218 --> 00:06:40.900
have got sixteen powers on every petal.

00:06:43.829 --> 00:06:51.917
Now the five elements is the right side,

00:06:53.431 --> 00:07:04.909
which is the content or, we can say,
the matter of the brain.

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:20.345
The matter of the brain is created
in such a manner

00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:24.388
that it has a protective matter also.

00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:29.143
So we have grey matter and also

00:07:29.344 --> 00:07:34.907
the white matter which is outside
to protect the grey matter.

00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:59.202
Now these sixteen powers which are
expressed in every petal

00:08:02.757 --> 00:08:06.805
are coming from the left side.

00:08:09.133 --> 00:08:14.034
Shri Krishna is an Incarnation of the left
side.

00:08:16.331 --> 00:08:23.867
So the sixteen powers which are coming
from the left side

00:08:24.068 --> 00:08:33.136
adorn the petals which are made
of five elements.

00:08:41.955 --> 00:08:48.518
But these powers already exist
in the brain.

00:08:50.633 --> 00:09:03.542
By these five, plus sixteen, powers we do
all our nervous system work.

00:09:10.239 --> 00:09:15.973
For example, if you have to lift your hand
like this,

00:09:17.374 --> 00:09:25.087
then it is worked, first of all, through
the left side

00:09:25.288 --> 00:09:29.615
which desires that it should be lifted.

00:09:35.841 --> 00:09:45.710
And then is ordered to the five powers
or five elements: they go into the action.

00:09:51.415 --> 00:09:55.737
Also we have in our system

00:09:56.583 --> 00:10:06.224
a special type of arrangement where
there is a reflex action,

00:10:11.351 --> 00:10:17.908
which is built earlier in our evolution.

00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:31.704
So, in a human consciousness whatever
works is not a reflex action.

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:43.649
But now, when your Sahastrara is
enlightened with the Kundalini,

00:10:43.818 --> 00:10:54.378
all these one thousand powers multiply it
into sixteen thousand.

00:11:00.174 --> 00:11:04.871
So all the nerves in the body get
enlightenment.

00:11:07.636 --> 00:11:12.614
Your attention becomes enlightened.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:22.783
With these one thousand dimensions you
become collectively conscious.

00:11:25.868 --> 00:11:34.596
We can say like this: if there are sixteen
people staying in five houses

00:11:39.079 --> 00:11:42.765
and they are working separately

00:11:42.966 --> 00:11:46.410
and sometimes coordinating.

00:11:47.138 --> 00:11:50.558
But [then] a flood comes in.

00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:55.705
[Aside to the translator: “Flood, flood.”]

00:11:58.083 --> 00:12:04.830
As a result of the flood all these houses
are brought together

00:12:07.206 --> 00:12:12.335
and get enveloped into the energy
of that flood.

00:12:14.276 --> 00:12:17.975
Then they join hands together.

00:12:19.772 --> 00:12:23.442
They forget their houses

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:31.751
and they start using now a new energy
of collective consciousness.

00:12:34.757 --> 00:12:38.791
This is exactly what has happened in you,

00:12:39.899 --> 00:12:46.197
that as soon as the Kundalini has risen
within you and given you Realisation,

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:55.816
the flood has brought these dormant
energies in you into play.

00:13:04.944 --> 00:13:09.079
You don’t have to think that you have
to hold each other’s hand

00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:14.305
when there’s a flood, you just hold it
automatically, spontaneously.

00:13:21.039 --> 00:13:28.020
So all the energies suddenly start getting
into motion.

00:13:31.792 --> 00:13:40.716
So this power where the one thousand
energies of the brain

00:13:40.917 --> 00:13:48.438
[are] suddenly awakened, is the power
called as Viratangana.

00:13:56.514 --> 00:14:01.379
That is - she is the power of the Virat.

00:14:04.357 --> 00:14:12.574
She is the power which makes Shri Krishna
a Virat.

00:14:16.895 --> 00:14:26.160
So the sixteen thousand powers which
He achieves in your being

00:14:29.596 --> 00:14:34.232
is done through the power of Viratangana.

00:14:38.448 --> 00:14:44.959
And at these modern times you know
who is that.

00:14:47.913 --> 00:14:53.138
So the Adi Shakti takes the form
of Viratangana.

00:14:56.611 --> 00:15:05.556
With that enlightenment you achieve
your Realisation.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:14.131
So the Kundalini passing through different
centres,

00:15:14.332 --> 00:15:18.941
enlightening the different energies,
ultimately comes to the brain

00:15:19.142 --> 00:15:23.889
and enlightens the Viratangana power.

00:15:33.268 --> 00:15:40.279
At this point, at the brain point,
the Kundalini starts spreading in the head.

00:15:43.989 --> 00:15:50.103
She, of course, shoots off from the
Sahastrara but also she trickles down

00:15:50.304 --> 00:15:57.782
through this plate of the brain (medha)
downwards on the sympathetic.

00:16:07.511 --> 00:16:12.167
That relaxes you. That’s why you feel
relaxed.

00:16:12.467 --> 00:16:15.935
It relaxes the sympathetic.

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:22.074
That enlarges the centres.

00:16:22.518 --> 00:16:29.005
It brings it back to its normal positions.

00:16:30.909 --> 00:16:34.263
The enlargement of the parasympathetic,
or Sushumna,

00:16:34.464 --> 00:16:39.428
makes the Kundalini rise in more quantum.

00:16:46.829 --> 00:16:53.268
It is all done by a reflex action
of Kundalini.

00:16:55.170 --> 00:16:59.813
So the Kundalini is already built in such
a manner that, when she rises,

00:17:00.014 --> 00:17:04.867
she automatically does all these things.

00:17:09.631 --> 00:17:15.822
So your Kundalini has got the power
to enlighten all your centres,

00:17:16.023 --> 00:17:23.491
and to enlighten your brain, and
to relax you,

00:17:23.692 --> 00:17:32.715
to increase the size of the centres, and
make the Kundalini rise again!

00:17:48.251 --> 00:17:54.412
But the Kundalini has a very special power:

00:17:55.885 --> 00:18:01.865
that every human being’s Kundalini
knows Me.

00:18:05.521 --> 00:18:08.037
Many people who have just seen
My photograph

00:18:08.238 --> 00:18:12.475
have got their Kundalini awakened.

00:18:17.391 --> 00:18:23.116
But if your centres are very clouded,
or exhausted,

00:18:23.317 --> 00:18:29.412
or jammed together, or separated away
from each other,

00:18:29.613 --> 00:18:33.761
then the Kundalini stops there.

00:18:45.739 --> 00:18:52.625
That’s why some people get Realisation
very fast and some take time.
