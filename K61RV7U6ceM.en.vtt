00:01:31.897 --> 00:01:42.083
and the boys, little boys will be the brothers of the wife, brothers of the wife,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.107
so you select they will be the brothers of the wife,

00:01:46.324 --> 00:01:49.871
 and the girls will be the flower girls.

00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:55.956
 And the bride has to have one more thing, is a bridesmaid,

00:01:56.385 --> 00:02:00.934
 which should be a little grown-up girl, who has to look after the bride.

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:03.032
 Did you follow the point?

00:02:03.536 --> 00:02:06.458
 So how many people all together?

00:02:12.796 --> 00:02:14.787
 Same. Me, I'm out of it.

00:02:29.702 --> 00:02:32.948
 Every girl, flower girl, should be general,

00:02:33.258 --> 00:02:36.465
flower girls need not be belonging to any girl as such.

00:02:36.664 --> 00:02:42.003
But she needs a sister, younger sister.

00:02:47.716 --> 00:02:55.985
Yes, yes, at least a father or a mother, one of the two.
 At least, at least.

00:02:58.581 --> 00:03:00.809
 All right. This is what you have to select.

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:07.598
So, now the program is such that tomorrow all the boys have to,

00:03:07.922 --> 00:03:13.326
 all the girls have to come round at about five o'clock,

00:03:14.031 --> 00:03:18.531
 and they'll be applied with haldi.  It will take about ten minutes as you know.

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:21.809
 After that the girls will go for their baths.

00:03:21.947 --> 00:03:24.787
Then the boys will be applied the haldi.

00:03:25.321 --> 00:03:28.413
After that the boys will go and take their baths

00:03:28.501 --> 00:03:35.683
and go to this place nearby, what you call?
 Motel, you are there.

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.525
 So the boys go down there.

00:03:38.785 --> 00:03:44.221
So we finish at about, say, the whole thing from haldi

00:03:44.384 --> 00:03:50.105
to going there and going in a procession whatever it is --
 you have to get some cars for them to come down,

00:03:50.296 --> 00:03:53.918
 altogether should be by seven o'clock you should be here.

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:57.384
So girls should be ready about say six-thirty.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.562
They should be ready by six-thirty.

00:03:59.618 --> 00:04:03.101
 So they do the Gauri Puja in half an hour's time.

00:04:03.264 --> 00:04:07.200
 By that time the boys arrive, so girls are there ready to receive them.

00:04:07.287 --> 00:04:11.158
Say we can put it, girls will do even earlier than that.

00:04:11.308 --> 00:04:14.031
So the girls are ready beforehand,

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:19.372
 so they have time, like five o'clock, they come, do it, ten minutes,

00:04:19.493 --> 00:04:22.981
 have their baths, this, that. And then start getting ready.

00:04:23.228 --> 00:04:27.892
They should try to be ready say five-thirty.
 They finish this in one hour's time.

00:04:27.982 --> 00:04:32.929
 So whatever you need to be ready with, you just keep with yourself

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.331
and as soon as you finish your bath you start getting ready.

00:04:36.421 --> 00:04:39.611
So you are ready, say, by about seven o'clock.

00:04:39.714 --> 00:04:45.328
The boys should arrive here whence about seven-five, or so.

00:04:45.501 --> 00:04:48.890
 The girls will be standing in the line, the boys will arrive,

00:04:49.017 --> 00:04:51.985
 and then they'll be given garlands.

00:04:52.121 --> 00:04:58.366
 Then the father or mother or both of them of the girl will go and do the aarti

00:04:58.492 --> 00:05:01.277
and invite the boy to come inside.

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:05.280
 And then they will be garlanded.

00:05:05.554 --> 00:05:10.561
 First the girl has to garland, and then the boy has to garland. All right.

00:05:10.888 --> 00:05:17.253
When the girls are moving, all the flower girls must be ready with the flowers,
and they have to shower flowers on the way.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:25.164
 And all of them should stand in one line and the little boys should be with the brother,

00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:30.729
 as brothers should be also standing with the girl,

00:05:30.859 --> 00:05:36.811
so the little boys and the sisters all walk forward.

00:05:37.063 --> 00:05:42.057
But the mother and father now go to the fire and sit there

00:05:42.288 --> 00:05:49.682
 till they have garlanded, or they can come at the back of
the boy, and carry them to the fire. All right. Correct?

00:05:55.107 --> 00:05:56.916
Then we have the ceremony.

00:05:57.435 --> 00:06:02.609
And after the ceremony we'll have the rice cooked by Me.

00:06:02.963 --> 00:06:04.399
What we call pilaf.

00:06:04.524 --> 00:06:07.843
Which I cooked for people in Sydney,

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:11.996
 but I didn't do that for Melbourne, so I want to do it. All right.

00:06:14.783 --> 00:06:20.161
Then next day we are having in the morning time, we are having the puja.

00:06:20.884 --> 00:06:25.001
Its not a very long puja because we'll not have havan

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:28.956
so it will be from say about eleven till one o'clock.

00:06:29.628 --> 00:06:32.819
 Then the rice that will be left over will be eaten after that,

00:06:32.907 --> 00:06:34.829
 so that you don't have to bother to ...

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:42.173
Then you have to prepare, at seven o'clock we are going to have here the workshop.

00:06:48.787 --> 00:06:50.508
 Any questions?

00:06:57.647 --> 00:07:03.615
Yes, ornaments you see, all these ornaments are actually given,

00:07:03.986 --> 00:07:10.401
 at the time when the girl is doing her, you see this, she gets,

00:07:10.532 --> 00:07:15.419
 she does all her washing and all that  and she gets ready,

00:07:15.513 --> 00:07:21.240
 when she takes her bath, you see, she wears another sari,

00:07:21.414 --> 00:07:25.656
and she comes out, she comes in the room where everybody sits down

00:07:25.778 --> 00:07:29.174
and they are given these ornaments by the boys' side.

00:07:29.577 --> 00:07:31.921
So somebody, the mama or somebody

00:07:32.016 --> 00:07:37.344
 maybe the mother or mama of that, should come and give those ornaments to the girl.

00:07:37.888 --> 00:07:42.868
All right. When the ornaments are given, then they go away

00:07:42.996 --> 00:07:45.745
 and the girls start dressing up fully,

00:07:45.857 --> 00:07:49.761
they go away and then they go round with the boys dressed

00:07:49.954 --> 00:07:53.413
 and arrive here about five minutes past seven.

00:07:53.548 --> 00:07:56.325
 Keep it that way. All right.

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:02.754
 What else?

00:08:08.687 --> 00:08:11.928
I hope you have got dresses and all that for the (...?)

00:08:12.516 --> 00:08:17.904
 He has done a good job, very fast.
And the presents, have you got them?

00:08:21.627 --> 00:08:24.865
 For the bride and bridegroom?

00:08:29.489 --> 00:08:33.509
Tomorrow morning I am thinking I am going to get something, present.

00:08:34.335 --> 00:08:38.195
Now one more thing I have to tell you. Anybody who can do it.

00:08:40.219 --> 00:08:45.624
That you must get Me the list of children,  and their age groups.

00:08:46.168 --> 00:08:53.168
Say, from sixteen downwards. Sixteen to fourteen,

00:08:53.594 --> 00:08:57.216
 then fourteen to twelve, like that.

00:08:57.365 --> 00:09:01.827
We have the age group, like that. Alright.

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:08.126
Tomorrow morning, if someone can give it tonight, I will be very thankful.

00:09:09.947 --> 00:09:12.264
And the small babies also.

00:09:14.477 --> 00:09:17.978
We have to get the presents.

00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.910
Any other question?

00:09:30.242 --> 00:09:33.247
That you find out, whichever is good.

00:09:34.421 --> 00:09:38.959
Modi is there, he is going to do it.
 All right. So do that.

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:45.883
It is going to be about at the most one hours ceremony,

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:49.883
 I have to still -- with Modi I have to do all that.

00:09:57.844 --> 00:10:05.627
Now the other people who are not getting married,

00:10:05.953 --> 00:10:08.765
should not run away with the boys,

00:10:09.762 --> 00:10:15.001
 but there's not going to be any procession;
 are we going to have any procession? All right.

00:10:15.185 --> 00:10:18.603
So the only thing what they can do when the boys arrive here,

00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:27.251
 just entering inside they can just, inside the road,

00:10:27.865 --> 00:10:29.967
 we can have that kind of a thing.

00:10:31.722 --> 00:10:35.224
 A small procession. From the gate, to this place.

00:10:50.408 --> 00:10:54.841
But you'll have to become one horse.

00:11:03.654 --> 00:11:08.243
But you can come in the car, don't walk down. Allright.

00:11:17.531 --> 00:11:24.943
And the boys will be given their clothes and all that, tonight or tomorrow.

00:11:25.348 --> 00:11:32.296
When they go, you see when they'll have the haldi you can't give them,

00:11:32.903 --> 00:11:36.463
 but after taking your baths you see they can take it.

00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:39.610
So what you do after taking baths they can take it from you.

00:11:39.643 --> 00:11:42.150
 But when they are playing with the haldi, nothing of the kind.

00:11:47.992 --> 00:11:53.350
 No, no, they have to have their baths, here,

00:11:58.646 --> 00:12:01.657
 accha, you do one thing bring some sort of a dressing gown,

00:12:01.871 --> 00:12:04.339
wipe you faces, go in your dressing gown.

00:12:07.671 --> 00:12:12.113
 You want to do the, here the bathing.

00:12:20.181 --> 00:12:23.229
That's a better idea. You find out that.

00:12:24.562 --> 00:12:27.919
 As long as you wipe your face and come...

00:12:28.813 --> 00:12:31.765
Look sensible.

00:12:38.857 --> 00:12:43.628
What you can do is cover yourself with some sheets.

00:12:47.703 --> 00:12:49.303
 Walk like...

00:12:58.834 --> 00:13:05.009
Now, is going to be a nice time tomorrow

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:08.220
but I hope you start the music and all that tomorrow morning.

00:13:08.268 --> 00:13:12.191
Music -- somebody should be in charge at that time.
We need lots of music.

00:13:12.646 --> 00:13:17.650
Tomorrow,  shennai and all that we should start in the morning.

00:13:26.564 --> 00:13:31.666
Now what about haldi? You got that mehendi, have you got mehendi?

00:13:32.206 --> 00:13:36.039
 You've got. So that has to be done tonight for girls.

00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:41.175
Somebody has to do that tonight or tomorrow morning.

00:13:47.152 --> 00:13:52.553
So you do one thing, do that tonight and then tomorrow again,

00:13:52.780 --> 00:13:55.780
 those people will be coming so we can do it tomorrow to them.

00:13:56.383 --> 00:13:58.700
 Before they go off to sleep you should do it.

00:13:59.410 --> 00:14:03.483
As soon as they come so finish half of them and the rest can be done.

00:14:03.976 --> 00:14:06.120
 That can be done tonight.

00:14:14.251 --> 00:14:16.413
 Children are quite excited.

00:14:17.414 --> 00:14:21.564
 You haven't seen the weddings you see but they came on the horses.

00:14:21.796 --> 00:14:25.658
Here there are no horses, otherwise we should have brought them on horses.

00:14:34.177 --> 00:14:39.339
We had fifty-four couples, can you imagine, one hundred and eight.

00:14:40.208 --> 00:14:44.822
Sixteen is a good idea, now only sixteen now. Nothing exceeding.

00:14:59.980 --> 00:15:04.321
Allright. Now can I take your leave?
