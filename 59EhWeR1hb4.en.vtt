00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.880
Who are the new people today, for the first
time?

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:04.880
You?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.070
I am sorry I had to say all these things because
today was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.519
in the beginning.

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:18.929
And we are all going to enter into the same
Realm and it will be handy for you to know

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:28.720
what is expected of Sahaja Yogis, and with
that expectation I request you not to pay

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.200
attention to what I have said, much.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.310
You should not be frightened.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.470
It’s not that frightening.

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.390
You’ll like it later on very much!

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.000
What I have said it, you see.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.190
So come forward.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.320
Those who have come for the first time, please
come forward.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.620
You come for the first time?

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.620
All right.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.620
Come forward!

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.500
Will be better idea.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.579
No, no, here, on the chair.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:58.050
On the first row of chairs.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.650
Will be a good idea.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:01.650
Yes.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.810
Actually, it happens that your religion gets
enlightened.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.810
You become that.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:06.900
Then you can’t help it.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.900
What to do?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.420
I mean you don’t have to tell, “Don’t
do!

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.689
Don’t do!”

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:13.579
It just happens.

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:16.740
You just can’t do it.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.909
It’s so helpful, isn’t it?

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:23.069
You just can’t do it.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:26.859
You don’t feel like doing it!

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.700
Because if you are enjoying your Spirit you
don’t feel like doing nonsensical things.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.130
It is better to get it and see for yourself
what happens.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:34.130
All right?

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.729
That’s the best way to give it a full chance.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.139
Those who have come for the first time do
come forward.

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:41.749
You’ve come for the first time?

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:42.749
Please come forward.

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:43.749
No!

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:44.749
You are not for the first time!

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:45.749
Let her come forward here.

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:47.880
You are all for the first time here?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.880
No.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.530
You can go one step backward, is a good idea.

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:56.950
You see, you can receive my vibrations even
from there where Kingsley is.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.990
Isn’t it Kingsley?

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.380
Aren’t you receiving my vibrations?

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:03.380
Much more!

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.889
Yes that’s it.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:11.160
Now this is a system which is built within
us.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.380
That’s why it is called as ‘Sahaja’.

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.410
This is what is the system within us that
exists.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.590
‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.200
This is all born with you.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.510
You have achieved it.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.120
It’s all within you.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.630
It’s a system that is built into this or
built into that.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:35.200
In the same way it’s a system built into
you.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.810
You are just ready.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:38.990
You are to be put to the mains.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.780
That’s all is the job is.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.580
For putting to the mains also there’s something
built into you.

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:49.480
If you see the triangular bone called as ‘sacrum’,
means ‘sacred bone’, this Kundalini is

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.480
there.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.630
This is the one that gives you your rebirth.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.740
By rebirth what happens [is] that your awareness,
which is human awareness, becomes enlightened

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.870
by your Spirit.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.360
Your Spirit comes into your awareness.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.540
So far your Spirit is not.

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.750
Your Spirit knows all about you.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:13.650
It is in your heart.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:18.952
But you do not know about It.

00:03:18.952 --> 00:03:24.110
So what happens [is] this Spirit, which is
enjoying itself, enlightens your awareness

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.990
and you get a new awareness by which you start
feeling a cool breeze in your hand, a cool

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.660
breeze in your hand.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.780
And this cool breeze, for the first time,
on your central nervous system starts flowing.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.650
So you feel it, actually you feel it.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.910
Now the enlightenment takes place of all these
centres which are within you, which are there

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.290
because of our evolutionary process.

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:55.100
And these enlightened centres are on your
fingers.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.540
They get enlightened too and you start feeling
them within you.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.510
You start feeling your own centres and you
start feeling the centres of others.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:10.090
Now this happening takes place within you
of the Kundalini awakening just to attract

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.160
your attention inside.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.090
Because your attention is outside, you cannot
take it in.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:17.039
You know many people think, “You put your
attention here, you put your attention there.

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.060
” – it’s all wrong.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.870
It has to be spontaneously attracted inside
and it’s done by this Kundalini, and Kundalini

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:28.010
is just like a germinating primule within
us, a seed.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:32.370
It just rises spontaneously.

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.970
And when it rises it breaks through here.

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:36.560
And this is what is the real Baptism.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.040
You really feel it here coming out.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.540
You can feel the cool breeze coming out.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.060
You can feel the cool breeze from your hands.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:56.060
This is real Baptism that John the Baptist
wanted people to have, and that Christ talked

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.060
about.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.800
All the religions have taught us to be in
the centre.

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.510
When they said, “Don’t do this, don’t
do that,” they did not want to condition

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:16.180
us but to tell us that how we are going to
be in the centre.

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:30.650
And when we are in the centre then what happens
to us [is] that you get the desire to know

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.400
your Spirit.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:38.590
And this desire is fulfilled through the awakening
of the Kundalini.

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:44.710
Now the Sahaja Yoga at this stage is really
a Maha Yoga in the sense [that] it is the

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:48.350
Great Yoga because many people can get Realisation.

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:54.350
Thousands of people can get it because the
blossom time has come.

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:00.570
But even if they get Realisation, they are
to be looked after, they are to be nourished,

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:02.800
they are to be told about it.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.400
Everything should be decoded.

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.100
You will be amazed – everything becomes
so logical.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.050
Gradually you start understanding it.

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:13.750
Your complete freedom is established.

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.800
Nobody says that, “Don’t do this!”

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.930
Nothing is said.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:22.340
But you just don’t do it – yourself!

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:23.340
I will not tell you as Moses had to tell,
poor thing.

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:24.350
He had to face all the mad people.

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:30.380
But no, after Realisation it just happens
and you just don’t do it.

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:31.380
You will not do it.

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:32.380
It just happens to you.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.930
It is nothing to be told.

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:36.120
It just happens.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.610
It works out.

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.940
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:45.150
In the beginning you have to be really ardent
Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:46.150
In the beginning you have to be.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:49.280
It’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga still
in England, I would say.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:54.060
Really ardently attached to it by which you
develop yourself very well and develop this

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:57.050
tree of Sahaja Yoga in your own country.

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:59.310
Because you have to save so many.

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:01.169
The Last Judgment has started.

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:02.169
It’s started.

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.070
Through Kundalini awakening only you judge
yourself.

00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:07.970
You know what are the centres you are catching,
what are your problems.

00:07:07.970 --> 00:07:10.030
You know what are the centres others are catching.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.030
You judge yourself.

00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:15.070
Supposing a person comes and tell me, “Mother,
my Agnya is very bad.

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:16.240
” Do you know what it means?

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.909
That, “My ego has developed.

00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:21.270
” But [if] you tell somebody, “You have
got an ego.

00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:23.410
” – you will have a punch on your head!

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:28.690
But the person himself comes and says, “Mother,
I see my ego.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:30.110
” You start seeing yourself.

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.419
You start seeing your problems, because you
are out of it.

00:07:34.419 --> 00:07:37.669
And then you can cure it also and make it
better.

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:42.590
You improve it and you are better.

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:46.100
You judge yourself and you judge yourself
with love and understanding.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.870
You don’t hate yourself by that.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.870
It’s only you, yourself.

00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:49.870
You are going to judge.

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:56.960
Within you is the power of God that judges
you, is the Spirit which tells you.

00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:59.312
A rapport is established with the Spirit.

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:03.580
The Spirit itself will tell you, “This is
the mistake, this is the problem.

00:08:03.580 --> 00:08:04.930
” We don’t need anybody to tell us.

00:08:04.930 --> 00:08:07.560
It’s only you who will know.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:10.630
It’s only you who will judge yourself.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:12.350
It’s only you who will grow yourself.

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.040
It’s your own freedom.

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.490
It’s your own Self.

00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:20.790
Your entire personality changes, entire personality
changes.

00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:26.110
I have never told anybody not to take drugs
as such, except for one or two people who

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:27.400
were still carrying on.

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.699
But also very mildly.

00:08:28.699 --> 00:08:31.940
And I told them how to get rid of it.

00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:35.130
But you just don’t want to take them, just
don’t like it.

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:39.940
You find it very filthy.

00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.130
You feel like vomiting.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.146
Just like that, the religion is enlightened
in your stomach.

00:08:44.146 --> 00:08:46.380
That the time has come now for you to do it.

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:49.930
That was the time when it was not so [then]
they taught you how to do it.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.310
But today the time has come, it can work out.

00:08:51.310 --> 00:08:54.209
You are all just there.

00:08:54.209 --> 00:08:58.670
The completion of the whole creation has to
come this way.

00:08:58.670 --> 00:09:01.200
It has to work out.

00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.790
But you cannot reason it out.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.670
But once you get it – because it’s beyond
reason, it happens beyond reason; the Kundalini

00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:13.110
awakens not by reason, spontaneously, by master
only – once it happens then the whole thing

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:15.210
becomes logical.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:17.660
You see, there’s a microscope, then you
can see through it.

00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.310
But if there is not a microscope, you cannot
understand.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:25.180
The ‘microscope’ is your Spirit.

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.110
It’s very simple.

00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:32.100
Now, I do not want to go into details about
it.

00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.800
I think these people have been given…

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:38.370
Gavin have you given them the papers and things?

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:43.870
Let them see for themselves.

00:09:43.870 --> 00:09:48.880
Have you all got the papers?

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.440
Have you got?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:51.440
No?

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:52.520
Let her have.

00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.600
Let this lady have.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.660
You sit a little erect, all right?

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.670
Straight, sit little straight.

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:00.680
All right.

00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.600
You have to sit a little erect, not much,
but a little erect.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.860
Not slouchy.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:07.790
Neither like this.

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:09.240
Just sit straight.

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.970
Put your hands like this, all of you.

00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:15.830
Just put your hands.

00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.680
Now close your eyes.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:25.830
Put your feet like this, little straight,
on the ground.

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:37.700
Not pressing much but they should be on the
ground properly.

00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:39.130
Come in!

00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:40.370
Come!

00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:46.600
There are three, four seats.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.330
Here, in front.

00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:51.580
Yes.

00:10:51.580 --> 00:11:04.529
After Realisation you have to go very fast
and try to understand it, otherwise you may

00:11:04.529 --> 00:11:05.810
lose your vibrations.

00:11:05.810 --> 00:11:06.810
That happens with some people.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.810
So be careful!

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.860
It’s a very, very delicate thing; it’s
very subtle.

00:11:10.860 --> 00:11:17.589
And because we are gross – suddenly we become
subtle – if we do not catch up to it, we

00:11:17.589 --> 00:11:18.589
lose it also.

00:11:18.589 --> 00:11:24.950
So for one month after Realisation you have
to be very, very careful and get hold of another

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:27.150
Sahaja Yogis here and we also have an ashram
here.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.330
We have to work it out.

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:33.310
Close your eyes.

00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.279
Just close your eyes.

00:11:37.279 --> 00:11:39.950
It just works.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:41.110
Just close your eyes.

00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:42.660
Don’t think about it.

00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:43.660
Don’t think.

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:44.773
It will work out without thinking.

00:11:44.773 --> 00:11:47.170
Put both the hands towards me, please.

00:11:47.170 --> 00:11:52.010
Both the hands like this.

00:11:52.010 --> 00:11:56.470
One of the centres that is catching in most
of you is that you all feel guilty for nothing

00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:59.540
at all, for nothing at all.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:02.120
It’s a fashion to feel guilty.

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:05.990
So everybody starts feeling guilty for nothing
at all.

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:07.890
Or maybe we confess and this and that.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:13.240
Now I have to tell you that not to feel guilty
at all.

00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:15.370
Say that, “I am not guilty.

00:12:15.370 --> 00:12:16.370
”

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:18.339
Thrice you say, “Mother, I am not guilty.

00:12:18.339 --> 00:12:19.339
”

00:12:19.339 --> 00:12:25.830
This is also a myth that you feel guilty.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:41.710
That will help you a lot.

00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:57.709
Once you get your Realisation you have to
also have the spiritual education to know

00:12:57.709 --> 00:13:01.680
how to handle this, how to handle this power.

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:21.830
You are getting it because this is your own
right, but you must know what

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:22.830
you are getting.

00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.770
They’ve got it, all of them.

00:13:26.770 --> 00:13:35.910
All the Sahaja Yogis should receive vibrations
and expose completely with their heart, absolutely.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.920
Just put it.

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:41.930
Be meditative today.

00:13:41.930 --> 00:13:43.860
And you have to promise in your heart.

00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:53.380
You have to be much more active and ardent
about Sahaja Yoga if you have to save your

00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:57.649
brothers and sisters.

00:13:57.649 --> 00:14:01.060
Only your heart can be binding, nothing else.

00:14:01.060 --> 00:14:02.060
Nothing else.

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.320
It’s only your heart.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:14.440
As you are attached to someone you love, you
should be attached to your Spirit.

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:16.649
Spirit you should love the most.

00:14:16.649 --> 00:14:20.640
Nobody is more important than your Spirit.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:23.500
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hands?

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:24.500
Not yet?

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:25.500
Close your eyes.

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:26.500
Have patience with yourself.

00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:28.100
One has to have patience.

00:14:28.100 --> 00:14:29.190
Close your eyes.

00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.190
Have patience!

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:31.190
Just don’t think.

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:33.110
It will work out.

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:35.900
Have patience with yourself!

00:14:35.900 --> 00:14:41.149
You put both the hands towards me, not meeting
each other but towards me, separate.

00:14:41.149 --> 00:14:45.800
Put both the hands separately, not towards
each other but towards me.

00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:47.850
Please put them towards me.

00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:48.850
Yes.

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:50.970
Close your eyes.

00:14:50.970 --> 00:14:53.310
Close your eyes.

00:14:53.310 --> 00:14:54.310
And just leave it.

00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:55.390
Don’t think about it.

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:58.100
Don’t worry about it.

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.380
It will work.

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.980
It’s like just a flower becoming a fruit
– spontaneously.

00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:08.110
Just close your eyes and put your hands towards
me.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:14.590
Put your attention to your heart.

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:16.520
Catch the joy part of it.

00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:17.520
Just heart.

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.850
Just put your both the hands towards me only
and just pay attention to your heart.

00:15:20.850 --> 00:15:23.890
It will work out.

00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:28.440
Are you feeling cool breeze?

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:31.160
It’s good, great.

00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.889
Just enjoy it.

00:15:33.889 --> 00:15:35.709
Just enjoy.

00:15:35.709 --> 00:15:38.741
Do not pay attention in one particular direction.

00:15:38.741 --> 00:15:40.230
Just leave it free.

00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:45.709
Just leave it free.

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:48.170
Do not fix your attention anywhere.

00:15:48.170 --> 00:15:55.079
Just leave it free.

00:15:55.079 --> 00:15:56.079
It will work out.

00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:57.079
Gavin, organise for these people behind.

00:15:57.079 --> 00:15:59.940
Ask people to slowly come along.

00:15:59.940 --> 00:16:04.320
Keep your eyes shut.

00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.360
All new people please keep your eyes shut.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.389
They are going to check you.

00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:20.250
One by one, yes move on.

00:16:20.250 --> 00:16:24.680
Jill, come forward.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:32.070
Start moving in the centre.

00:16:32.070 --> 00:16:33.550
Yes.

00:16:33.550 --> 00:16:35.019
Good.

00:16:35.019 --> 00:16:44.589
Those Sahaja Yogis who want to get themselves
also checked up, ask other Sahaja Yogis to

00:16:44.589 --> 00:16:48.350
do it.

00:16:48.350 --> 00:16:59.880
Magda, I think these three people are for
the first time or what?

00:16:59.880 --> 00:17:03.850
Just see them, their vibrations.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:09.110
They haven’t felt it yet.

00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:14.010
Can you move a little coming up here.

00:17:14.010 --> 00:17:15.220
Marcus?

00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:20.059
Or who is there?

00:17:20.059 --> 00:17:23.780
Those who want to be checked.

00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:28.950
Also ask others to be checked.

00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:33.260
Douglas, go and check Dinesh.

00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:38.150
All of you must get checking!

00:17:38.150 --> 00:17:40.260
Those of you who want checking should raise
your hands.

00:17:40.260 --> 00:17:45.000
Ask people to check you.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:46.059
Check her.

00:17:46.059 --> 00:17:50.860
Vishuddhi, Left Vishuddhis are horrible.

00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:56.620
I don’t know what to say.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.250
Hester [Spiro], you ask somebody to check
you also.

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:01.520
Peter [Pearce], you sit down.

00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.360
David [Spiro] you sit down!

00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.360
Get yourself checked!

00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:06.000
Linda [Pearce], Peter, all of you.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Please.

00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:08.000
Because I am going away.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.679
Let everybody be checked – better is.

00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:11.679
Marcus?

00:18:11.679 --> 00:18:14.410
You be checked also.

00:18:14.410 --> 00:18:23.169
Better to get it done once for all.

00:18:23.169 --> 00:18:27.900
Get them checked.

00:18:27.900 --> 00:18:34.210
Who can check her?

00:18:34.210 --> 00:18:37.370
Ray [Harris]?

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:42.100
Where is he?

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:48.410
Go and check Hester.

00:18:48.410 --> 00:18:53.150
He’s got it?

00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:57.140
Kingsley you check Hester, it’s better.

00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:03.780
He (Ray) is a Jew (also) so it would be better!

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:08.750
(laughing) Somebody else should do it it’s
better.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.930
May God bless you!

00:19:11.930 --> 00:19:16.040
But everybody gets checked it’s better!

00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:18.770
John, you sit down.

00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.510
You get yourself checked.

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.880
Sit down.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:23.880
Marcus?

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:25.610
Is he checked?

00:19:25.610 --> 00:19:27.669
How are they?

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:36.510
Now those who are checking should get themselves
checked also, is a better idea.

00:19:36.510 --> 00:19:39.910
There should be nothing.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:45.990
‘Prana’ – say the mantra for him.

00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:51.360
For her, Malcolm [Murdoch], ‘Prana’ is
the mantra for her.

00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:52.360
Haa!

00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:53.360
Done.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.810
Just broken through.

00:19:54.810 --> 00:19:55.810
Haaa!

00:19:55.810 --> 00:20:04.980
Now this is to be judged a little by yourself.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.750
You should know.

00:20:07.750 --> 00:20:15.559
These are the small things that one should
know.

00:20:15.559 --> 00:20:17.549
This gentleman?

00:20:17.549 --> 00:20:23.530
Why don’t you see this gentleman?

00:20:23.530 --> 00:20:27.520
Can you check John.

00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:37.429
John, put your left hand towards me and right
hand outside.

00:20:37.429 --> 00:20:39.830
Felicity [Payment].

00:20:39.830 --> 00:20:45.850
Somebody should check Felicity also.

00:20:45.850 --> 00:20:49.800
Brighton people should again get themselves
rechecked afterwards.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:51.160
Everybody should get themselves rechecked.

00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.070
Somehow or other get yourself cleared out.

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:56.429
Every one of you.

00:20:56.429 --> 00:20:58.730
Gavin you also get yourself checked.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.140
Everybody should get yourself checked.

00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.049
That’s the best way.

00:21:02.049 --> 00:21:08.330
And we should be thankful to people for checking
us and giving us vibrations.

00:21:08.330 --> 00:21:11.549
Instead of getting angry and upset.

00:21:11.549 --> 00:21:14.419
How are the children?

00:21:14.419 --> 00:21:17.289
Jane [Brown] bring her.

00:21:17.289 --> 00:21:19.440
Is she alright?

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.590
Bring her here.

00:21:21.590 --> 00:21:23.380
How is it?

00:21:23.380 --> 00:21:42.070
Let everybody check today

00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:53.450
and give bandhans.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:22:03.730
What about this gentleman?

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:13.890
He’s got it?

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:27.750
He’s Ray’s father, he should get it.

00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:45.309
Tell him not to feel guilty about anything!

00:22:45.309 --> 00:22:55.020
You are facing Mother who loves you!

00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:04.340
Just say, “Mother I am not guilty.

00:23:04.340 --> 00:23:05.340
”

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:08.299
Just say that.

00:23:08.299 --> 00:23:17.740
What guilt can you people have?

00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:19.320
Jill?

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.900
Coming?

00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.490
Haaa!

00:23:22.490 --> 00:23:25.650
Alright Jill?

00:23:25.650 --> 00:23:30.400
It’s come up.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.150
How is she?

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:38.309
Don’t talk.

00:23:38.309 --> 00:23:46.830
Just raise the Kundalini.

00:23:46.830 --> 00:23:58.130
Just raise the Kundalini.

00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:02.290
You give him a bandhan.

00:24:02.290 --> 00:24:05.950
Chaya, tumse karab dekho.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:15.790
Regis, you also get yourself checked and others
should check and you check others.

00:24:15.790 --> 00:24:18.380
Every one of you.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.920
John, please put yourself into a bandhan.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.520
Now check other people.

00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.820
Come along.

00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:30.740
Those who have been checking sit down and
those who have to be checked.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:32.960
You’ve done it?

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.179
Have you done?

00:24:35.179 --> 00:24:37.400
You’ve got it?

00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.750
Have you felt anything?

00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:41.660
Did you feel any cool breeze?

00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:42.660
Good, great.

00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:43.660
Now close your eyes.

00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:44.660
Enjoy your Self.

00:24:44.660 --> 00:24:45.750
Now don’t stop at that!

00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:48.750
What do you say Malcolm?

00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:49.790
Better?

00:24:49.790 --> 00:24:53.970
What about this child?
