00:00:01.563 --> 00:00:05.813
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:13.063 --> 00:00:16.188
Some of you have found the truth,

00:00:17.208 --> 00:00:22.813
some of you have not found it fully,

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:27.562
and some of you have not found it at all.

00:00:29.483 --> 00:00:37.563
But if you look around in today's situation,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.306
you'll have to agree there's a big turmoil going on.

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:48.556
Countries after countries are taking

00:00:49.306 --> 00:00:52.430
to all kinds of wrong things.

00:00:52.931 --> 00:00:55.806
Lot of cold war is on,

00:00:57.181 --> 00:00:59.556
people are killing each other,

00:01:00.681 --> 00:01:06.181
destroying beautiful places,

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:13.931
cutting each other's throat for nothing at all.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.806
They are all human beings created by God.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.430
God Almighty has created them

00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:28.931
and has brought them to this level of human awareness.

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:32.931
At this juncture

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:38.556
one can't see where are we going in a collective way.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.431
This is, where have we to reach --or

00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.430
is it our destiny?

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.430
Is this the destiny of human beings,

00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:02.806
to be destroyed by each other

00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:08.056
for land or for anything else?

00:02:09.306 --> 00:02:12.806
Think of the whole world as one,

00:02:14.056 --> 00:02:17.931
and think what's happening all over:

00:02:18.306 --> 00:02:21.056
every day we read newspaper,

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.681
every day there is some sort of a horrible news

00:02:25.931 --> 00:02:30.181
about horrible things people are doing to each other,

00:02:30.556 --> 00:02:32.681
for no rhyme and reason.

00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:41.681
We have to think, what is the destiny?

00:02:43.056 --> 00:02:45.430
Where are we going?

00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:52.806
Are we going to hell or to Heaven?

00:02:54.931 --> 00:02:59.431
What is our situation around? Can we help it?

00:03:03.056 --> 00:03:05.556
What's wrong with human beings is

00:03:06.931 --> 00:03:15.430
they are still in the complete control of ignorance

00:03:15.806 --> 00:03:18.430
I would call it ignorance.

00:03:19.681 --> 00:03:22.431
And in that ignorance, in that darkness,

00:03:24.056 --> 00:03:27.306
they are doing these horrible things.

00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:34.306
Nobody wants to understand that what we are doing

00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:39.181
is nothing but complete destruction.

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:43.056
Is that our destiny,

00:03:43.431 --> 00:03:46.931
that we are going to get destroyed completely?

00:03:47.931 --> 00:03:50.806
What good are we doing?

00:03:52.806 --> 00:03:57.056
Under the name of some sort of nationality

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.306
or maybe some religion

00:04:00.556 --> 00:04:04.806
-- all kinds of things which are good --

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.430
but we are doing all wrong things.

00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:10.556
Fighting.

00:04:11.056 --> 00:04:14.306
Fighting is not the only thing.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.056
We hate.

00:04:19.306 --> 00:04:23.681
Anybody who can excite our hatred

00:04:26.181 --> 00:04:31.181
is very much adorable, very much liked,

00:04:31.556 --> 00:04:35.056
and under his guidance we form groups.

00:04:36.931 --> 00:04:43.306
All this is coming because this is the Last Judgment.

00:04:43.681 --> 00:04:47.681
I have told you this is the Last Judgment.

00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:53.430
And this Last Judgment will really decide

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:58.556
who are to be saved and who are to be doomed completely.

00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:03.430
It's a very, very serious thing.

00:05:04.556 --> 00:05:12.430
All of those who are aware should think about it.

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.056
Little patchwork here

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.430
and a little patchwork is not going to help.

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.430
Whatever you may try,

00:05:21.806 --> 00:05:26.430
unless and until you transform human beings,

00:05:26.681 --> 00:05:28.806
they cannot be saved.

00:05:30.681 --> 00:05:38.306
This transformation is not an impossible thing

00:05:38.806 --> 00:05:40.931
-- it's not difficult.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.430
This is the time for transformation,

00:05:44.806 --> 00:05:47.430
this is a chance for transformation.

00:05:47.806 --> 00:05:53.681
And within us is placed the power,

00:05:54.806 --> 00:05:58.056
as Tao has described,

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.681
is the mystical feminine Power within us.

00:06:02.181 --> 00:06:04.556
All of them have described it,

00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:09.056
I'm not the first person to say that;

00:06:10.681 --> 00:06:15.430
but nobody has been able perhaps so far

00:06:17.056 --> 00:06:21.430
to understand it or to accept it,

00:06:21.806 --> 00:06:24.430
that it should happen to you.

00:06:27.931 --> 00:06:33.430
You are born not only to be human beings,

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:37.306
but you have to be superhuman.

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.431
You have to enjoy yourself.

00:06:40.931 --> 00:06:44.556
Your life should be enjoyable, it should be blissful.

00:06:45.056 --> 00:06:47.056
It should not be a curse:

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.056
morning till evening worried about this, worried about that.

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.056
That is why you are created.

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:00.430
God had no intention of creating people

00:07:00.931 --> 00:07:04.931
who will be all the time worried how to quarrel,

00:07:05.306 --> 00:07:07.306
how to fight, how to save;

00:07:08.556 --> 00:07:13.431
but people who will live in complete harmony,

00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:16.681
peace and joy.

00:07:18.806 --> 00:07:20.806
That's why we are created.

00:07:21.306 --> 00:07:24.430
That is our destiny -- that is,

00:07:24.806 --> 00:07:27.681
not just I am telling you, but it's a fact.

00:07:28.306 --> 00:07:36.431
So we have to be, we have to be transformed.

00:07:38.056 --> 00:07:40.556
This transformation is not difficult.

00:07:41.181 --> 00:07:48.306
But what I find, people get satisfied with anything

00:07:49.556 --> 00:07:52.430
Hindus will go to the temple;

00:07:52.556 --> 00:07:55.181
they'll think, "Oh, we have done a great thing."

00:07:55.681 --> 00:07:57.931
Christians go to the church;

00:07:58.430 --> 00:08:00.431
they'll think they have done very good.

00:08:01.181 --> 00:08:04.806
Muslims will go and pray and think that they are great.

00:08:05.430 --> 00:08:07.430
What have they achieved?

00:08:07.931 --> 00:08:10.306
Face yourself, please.

00:08:10.556 --> 00:08:14.430
Face your limitations.

00:08:14.806 --> 00:08:16.931
Face your tribulations.

00:08:17.306 --> 00:08:20.431
Face your problems and see for yourself:

00:08:20.931 --> 00:08:23.806
have you been able to solve your problems?

00:08:27.181 --> 00:08:33.430
Have you been able to save yourself from calamities?

00:08:34.931 --> 00:08:40.431
Maybe big calamities may come to destroy people who are,

00:08:41.181 --> 00:08:44.430
who are doing harm, maybe.

00:08:45.806 --> 00:08:48.306
That may be the wish of God.

00:08:48.681 --> 00:08:51.431
But what is your wish?

00:08:52.306 --> 00:08:54.430
Why don't you think that

00:08:54.806 --> 00:09:01.181
"I have to be a person who is a store,

00:09:01.556 --> 00:09:06.556
who is a source of joy and love"?

00:09:08.056 --> 00:09:12.681
I am not only talking, but I want you all

00:09:13.181 --> 00:09:15.306
to get your Self-realization.

00:09:15.931 --> 00:09:17.430
What is Self-realization

00:09:17.931 --> 00:09:21.430
-- is to know your Self. You don't know your Self.

00:09:22.431 --> 00:09:24.306
You don't know.

00:09:24.931 --> 00:09:27.431
You are living in this world without knowing your Self

00:09:27.931 --> 00:09:29.431
-- can you imagine?

00:09:29.931 --> 00:09:31.681
You don't know what you are.

00:09:32.306 --> 00:09:35.306
You don't know that you are the spirit,

00:09:36.556 --> 00:09:42.056
and that you are the source of knowledge,

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:44.306
of pure knowledge.

00:09:44.681 --> 00:09:47.306
I find people sitting in a meeting,

00:09:47.806 --> 00:09:51.181
listening to some babaji

00:09:51.681 --> 00:09:55.681
who is telling them some story, very happy.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:02.306
This is not going to give you the reality and the truth.

00:10:03.430 --> 00:10:05.931
If you want to have reality and truth,

00:10:06.430 --> 00:10:08.556
then please try to understand

00:10:09.056 --> 00:10:11.431
that something has to happen

00:10:12.056 --> 00:10:15.431
to you, some transformation has to take place.

00:10:16.181 --> 00:10:18.430
You are not yet subtle enough,

00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:20.806
you haven't got those subtleties,

00:10:21.306 --> 00:10:23.430
till you reach that point --

00:10:23.806 --> 00:10:27.431
for which you don't have to leave your family,

00:10:28.181 --> 00:10:30.681
you don't have to leave your children,

00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:38.681
you don't have to leave your household and go to the jungles.

00:10:40.056 --> 00:10:42.430
There's no need to do all that.

00:10:43.056 --> 00:10:46.556
It's nice to say that "All right, you all take sanyasa

00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:50.056
and give all that belongs to you to me."

00:10:52.181 --> 00:10:54.806
It's such a stupid idea.

00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:59.430
These are emergencies today.

00:11:00.556 --> 00:11:05.306
We are living in a very emergent conditions

00:11:05.681 --> 00:11:07.181
-- try to understand.

00:11:07.556 --> 00:11:09.681
And I want to warn you

00:11:10.181 --> 00:11:12.556
that if you don't go deep into yourself

00:11:13.056 --> 00:11:15.806
and find out what you are,

00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:20.931
and take to your transformation,

00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:23.431
anything is possible.

00:11:24.931 --> 00:11:27.806
All kinds of diseases are coming up,

00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:32.681
all kinds of new problems of children coming up,

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.931
all kinds of national problems are there,

00:11:37.431 --> 00:11:40.430
all kinds of international problems are there,

00:11:40.931 --> 00:11:43.806
that people can't help it.

00:11:45.056 --> 00:11:52.306
So we have to get out of this and become a solid,

00:11:52.556 --> 00:11:55.681
a personality of truth.

00:11:56.306 --> 00:11:58.306
We don't know what is the truth is.

00:11:59.931 --> 00:12:05.430
We are worse than animals whose eyes are open,

00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:09.556
while our eyes are closed.

00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.431
Is not to condemn yourself in any way,

00:12:15.556 --> 00:12:18.181
but to make you alert and aware

00:12:18.681 --> 00:12:21.931
that human beings have to change.

00:12:22.431 --> 00:12:26.431
Otherwise it's just, you come to My lecture,

00:12:26.931 --> 00:12:30.556
tomorrow you come to another lecture -- that's all.

00:12:31.056 --> 00:12:34.431
It's a everyday sort of a nice entertainment.

00:12:36.306 --> 00:12:41.181
But when I see the destiny,

00:12:41.681 --> 00:12:44.556
I don't know how many will be ruined,

00:12:45.306 --> 00:12:47.681
how many will be finished.

00:12:48.306 --> 00:12:50.181
What will happen to them?

00:12:50.556 --> 00:12:52.806
What diseases they will get,

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:55.931
what problems they will get?

00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.556
What will happen to their children,

00:12:59.556 --> 00:13:01.931
what will happen to their country,

00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:05.056
and what will happen to the whole world?

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:09.306
Just widen your vision.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:15.181
My vision is that all the people of the world

00:13:15.681 --> 00:13:18.056
should get transformation.

00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:23.306
We have enemies within ourselves,

00:13:25.931 --> 00:13:27.806
and when they talk of jihad,

00:13:28.306 --> 00:13:31.931
they talk that you fight your enemies within yourself.

00:13:32.431 --> 00:13:34.431
What are these enemies?

00:13:35.806 --> 00:13:39.431
These days, the worst is greed.

00:13:40.806 --> 00:13:43.181
There is greed.

00:13:43.556 --> 00:13:48.931
With that greed people can do anything they want to

00:13:49.431 --> 00:13:53.431
All kinds of things are happening out of greed.

00:13:54.056 --> 00:13:59.056
They'll have money, they'll have all kinds of facilities,

00:13:59.431 --> 00:14:04.306
but still this greed is such a satanic will of,

00:14:04.556 --> 00:14:07.556
that you don't even see what you have.

00:14:08.181 --> 00:14:12.431
And you want to have more and more, deceive people,

00:14:13.056 --> 00:14:15.931
deceive your government,

00:14:16.430 --> 00:14:19.806
deceive everyone and manage it.

00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:32.056
Then, another worse thing we have is anger.

00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:37.306
Anger doesn't allow you to see things as they are.

00:14:40.056 --> 00:14:44.056
We develop anger for small things:

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.431
like you have come to this country --

00:14:50.931 --> 00:14:58.430
I've seen people who are angry because of different color.

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.431
I can't understand.

00:15:04.181 --> 00:15:06.556
God has made different colors;

00:15:06.931 --> 00:15:11.181
other we all would have looked same, like military,

00:15:12.056 --> 00:15:14.431
and life would have been miserable.

00:15:14.806 --> 00:15:17.681
So the color has been created by nature.

00:15:18.306 --> 00:15:23.556
So the whites or blacks -- what is the difference?

00:15:25.056 --> 00:15:27.430
I just don't understand.

00:15:27.931 --> 00:15:33.681
Because such a myth is going on.

00:15:34.931 --> 00:15:37.806
With this myth we are fighting.

00:15:38.430 --> 00:15:41.556
The whites are fighting with the blacks,

00:15:41.931 --> 00:15:44.556
and the blacks are fighting with the whites.

00:15:46.056 --> 00:15:53.931
And then they go also for burning their skin in the sun,

00:15:56.056 --> 00:15:58.430
getting skin cancers.

00:15:59.056 --> 00:16:01.056
I just don't understand.

00:16:01.431 --> 00:16:04.431
There's no logic, there's no balance

00:16:04.931 --> 00:16:08.430
in us to see that what we are doing.

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:14.431
Why are we wasting this precious time,

00:16:15.181 --> 00:16:17.681
when we have to get transformation?

00:16:18.806 --> 00:16:21.931
This anger can be with anything;

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.430
anything one can develop anger.

00:16:27.931 --> 00:16:33.181
Is like a human failing, which is very common.

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:37.806
For the smallest thing people can get angry.

00:16:38.430 --> 00:16:41.931
And they like it, because with that they can oppress others;

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:44.430
they could be aggressive.

00:16:44.806 --> 00:16:48.681
So they want to have this anger within them,

00:16:49.430 --> 00:16:53.556
and with that anger they try to dominate others.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:57.681
This is the biggest problem:

00:16:58.306 --> 00:17:02.430
why do we want to dominate others,

00:17:02.931 --> 00:17:05.430
why do we want to oppress others,

00:17:06.056 --> 00:17:09.181
and why do we want to take control of others?

00:17:09.556 --> 00:17:11.556
We can't control ourselves;

00:17:11.931 --> 00:17:15.181
why are we wanting to control others?

00:17:16.181 --> 00:17:17.556
What is the need?

00:17:20.681 --> 00:17:23.931
Then, there are attachments:

00:17:25.056 --> 00:17:29.806
attachments to their houses,

00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:35.181
to their lands, to their children, to everything.

00:17:35.681 --> 00:17:41.931
But tomorrow you won't be here.

00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:46.431
You'll go with open hands.

00:17:47.056 --> 00:17:50.306
You can't carry anything with you.

00:17:51.556 --> 00:17:56.806
So such attachment to things:

00:17:58.056 --> 00:18:01.056
they're very particular about their cars,

00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:04.181
about their house, maintain it.

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:09.430
But what about yourself? Are you all right?

00:18:10.556 --> 00:18:16.556
Inside, are you absolutely calm, peaceful and joyful?

00:18:18.056 --> 00:18:20.431
Why are you wasting your energy

00:18:28.430 --> 00:18:31.681
in getting angry with others?

00:18:37.056 --> 00:18:46.806
That's the sign of life that will be also destroyed.

00:18:50.430 --> 00:18:59.431
If you look at another person he has, say, weaknesses,

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:04.931
apart from money, for women -- is very common --

00:19:05.431 --> 00:19:08.430
or women having for men.

00:19:09.556 --> 00:19:13.181
To get attractive, for what?

00:19:14.431 --> 00:19:16.806
Everybody has to get old.

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:23.806
What have you achieved by running after women,

00:19:24.306 --> 00:19:28.430
running after other sex?

00:19:29.556 --> 00:19:34.430
You have no sense of dignity, no sense of honor.

00:19:34.931 --> 00:19:37.806
If you are -- as long as you wear very good clothes

00:19:38.181 --> 00:19:40.430
you are regarded wonderful person.

00:19:41.806 --> 00:19:43.430
This is not the way.

00:19:43.931 --> 00:19:47.430
We have to introspect and see for ourselves:

00:19:47.931 --> 00:19:49.931
why are we doing this,

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:53.430
wasting our energy into nonsensical thing?

00:19:58.056 --> 00:20:03.306
So many people I meet are really half-mad and far gone;

00:20:03.556 --> 00:20:05.931
some of them are full-mad.

00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:09.431
And what they tell Me, that

00:20:09.931 --> 00:20:12.306
they wanted to marry a particular woman

00:20:12.431 --> 00:20:14.431
and a particular man or anything,

00:20:14.931 --> 00:20:18.556
and that's how they got it. I mean, how fragile!

00:20:21.431 --> 00:20:23.431
That's not being very great.

00:20:24.181 --> 00:20:29.931
You have to be very, very strong within yourself.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:35.056
Feel your Self. Your Self is the spirit,

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:38.806
is the reflection of God Almighty within you.

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:41.931
You can be very strong,

00:20:42.430 --> 00:20:44.181
you can be very healthy

00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:46.431
and you can be absolutely balanced,

00:20:46.931 --> 00:20:48.681
if you become the spirit.

00:20:50.181 --> 00:20:54.181
You have heard so much about spirit and spiritual life

00:20:57.430 --> 00:21:00.430
-- but have you reached that point?

00:21:01.681 --> 00:21:05.181
Even when you read, say, Zen system,

00:21:05.431 --> 00:21:10.181
Tao system, Bible, Koran, anything,

00:21:12.181 --> 00:21:16.431
do you know how to reach that point of the spirit?

00:21:17.056 --> 00:21:19.431
Not yet. Not yet.

00:21:20.181 --> 00:21:22.430
You have to know that;

00:21:22.806 --> 00:21:25.306
because you are very great,

00:21:25.681 --> 00:21:28.431
you are very precious,

00:21:29.056 --> 00:21:32.430
and you are so beautiful within.

00:21:33.431 --> 00:21:35.806
But you are not aware of it.

00:21:36.931 --> 00:21:39.056
You have to become that.

00:21:40.181 --> 00:21:43.431
That becoming is very important,

00:21:44.056 --> 00:21:49.431
and for that already God Almighty has organized within you

00:21:50.806 --> 00:21:54.556
which is called as kundalini,

00:21:56.431 --> 00:21:58.431
which can be awakened,

00:21:59.181 --> 00:22:03.806
and its awakening can give you Self-realization,

00:22:04.431 --> 00:22:08.931
can give you self-knowledge which we call "Atma sakshatkar."

00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:13.556
That's what is very, very important in your life to have it.

00:22:14.056 --> 00:22:15.431
And when it is free --

00:22:16.056 --> 00:22:18.806
you can't pay for it, how much can you pay?

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.430
-- when it is absolutely free,

00:22:24.806 --> 00:22:28.431
why don't you take your Self-realization,

00:22:29.181 --> 00:22:32.056
and why don't you grow?

00:22:32.556 --> 00:22:35.681
Instead of fighting in the name of religion.

00:22:38.681 --> 00:22:42.181
Every religion has said "You know thy Self."

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.681
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

00:22:47.917 --> 00:22:51.681
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

00:22:53.306 --> 00:22:55.430
Are they speaking?

00:22:56.681 --> 00:22:58.931
Hindus know about it,

00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.431
that we have to get our Self-realization.

00:23:03.181 --> 00:23:07.430
No use just listening to these babajis and giving them money.

00:23:11.556 --> 00:23:17.306
All this kind of rituals

00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:21.431
that we have been doing, our forefathers have been doing:

00:23:21.730 --> 00:23:24.056
what have we achieved? Nothing.

00:23:26.784 --> 00:23:30.181
So now, it's important for us to know

00:23:30.556 --> 00:23:36.430
that we have to have our evolution,

00:23:38.056 --> 00:23:41.430
reaching to the point of Self-realization.

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:46.430
If we were perfect there would have been no problem

00:23:47.931 --> 00:23:50.681
If we were self-realized people

00:23:51.181 --> 00:23:53.681
there would have been no problem.

00:23:55.181 --> 00:23:57.430
All kinds of selfishness,

00:23:58.056 --> 00:24:03.556
all kinds of limits we have put upon ourselves,

00:24:04.306 --> 00:24:07.056
all kinds of conditioning and ego

00:24:07.556 --> 00:24:13.430
which has been working our life and have been ruining us,

00:24:13.681 --> 00:24:16.931
we have to get over it.

00:24:17.014 --> 00:24:19.769
And once you get over it, you get united.

00:24:20.019 --> 00:24:22.894
Nobody has to tell you that you get united.

00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:27.018
You lose all misidentifications.

00:24:29.767 --> 00:24:31.767
The time is running short.

00:24:32.517 --> 00:24:34.517
I've been now here for the last,

00:24:34.892 --> 00:24:36.892
I don't know, twenty years or so.

00:24:37.517 --> 00:24:39.766
I worked very hard,

00:24:40.267 --> 00:24:44.142
but what I find that people don't realize

00:24:44.517 --> 00:24:46.517
what they are supposed to do.

00:24:50.767 --> 00:24:55.767
They like people who will just say something very simple

00:24:56.517 --> 00:24:59.517
-- all right, it's a little entertainment.

00:25:00.767 --> 00:25:06.517
So the whole humanity has to understand

00:25:07.892 --> 00:25:13.767
that destiny of destruction is to be avoided.

00:25:14.517 --> 00:25:17.767
Complete destruction is to be avoided.

00:25:19.267 --> 00:25:24.017
And very simple is that you enter into the Kingdom of God

00:25:24.766 --> 00:25:27.766
-- which is very easy: you don't have to pay anything,

00:25:28.267 --> 00:25:30.642
don't have to work out anything.

00:25:32.017 --> 00:25:34.142
You take your Self-realization,

00:25:34.766 --> 00:25:40.142
and then at home you spend about ten minutes meditating.

00:25:42.642 --> 00:25:48.517
Only your mind is all the time justifying your misbehavior.

00:25:48.892 --> 00:25:52.766
I call it "misbehavior" because it's against you.

00:25:53.142 --> 00:25:57.766
It's against God's wish,

00:25:58.766 --> 00:26:01.767
it's against humanity

00:26:02.267 --> 00:26:05.892
and it will destroy all the human beings.

00:26:07.767 --> 00:26:12.267
All these misidentifications have to be dropped,

00:26:12.766 --> 00:26:16.142
and you have to know that we are all one.

00:26:17.392 --> 00:26:21.766
We are all one, we are all global,

00:26:23.142 --> 00:26:27.017
we are not separated by color,

00:26:27.517 --> 00:26:31.766
race or religion, nation -- no.

00:26:33.142 --> 00:26:34.766
We are all one,

00:26:34.892 --> 00:26:40.369
and that oneness should not be established by slogans

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.741
or by shouting,

00:26:42.766 --> 00:26:46.267
but should be that oneness is to be felt within.

00:26:49.142 --> 00:26:51.767
It's not artificial.

00:26:52.267 --> 00:26:55.766
It has to be real, very real oneness,

00:26:56.142 --> 00:26:58.766
and that comes to you once you realize

00:26:59.017 --> 00:27:02.017
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

00:27:04.392 --> 00:27:10.392
Religions have brought you up to this point of awareness

00:27:10.767 --> 00:27:14.892
-- not for fighting, not for killing.

00:27:18.017 --> 00:27:20.142
Why, why?

00:27:20.766 --> 00:27:23.892
Human beings have diverted themselves.

00:27:24.392 --> 00:27:29.267
Because of complete ignorance of righteousness.

00:27:30.392 --> 00:27:39.017
Because of complete greed of oneself:

00:27:40.517 --> 00:27:46.392
oneself, just yourself, or your family at the most,

00:27:46.767 --> 00:27:49.142
or your relation.

00:27:51.392 --> 00:27:53.684
Why do you want to delimit yourself?

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:55.766
You are the spirit.

00:27:56.184 --> 00:28:02.766
Spirit is the ocean, ocean of knowledge,

00:28:04.017 --> 00:28:06.642
is the ocean of love,

00:28:07.766 --> 00:28:10.642
is the ocean of all blessings.

00:28:11.892 --> 00:28:14.767
So we have to decide.

00:28:15.392 --> 00:28:18.017
Today I have to request you,

00:28:18.642 --> 00:28:21.392
that there's not so much time left.

00:28:21.892 --> 00:28:26.767
We have to decide that we have to become the spirit

00:28:27.392 --> 00:28:30.142
That's all the religions have taught.

00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:37.142
But how to do it was not so much explained,

00:28:38.766 --> 00:28:40.642
and it didn't work out.

00:28:41.017 --> 00:28:44.892
Some of them did get it but they were outcasted.

00:28:45.517 --> 00:28:47.517
Nobody listened to them.

00:28:47.892 --> 00:28:51.017
Even people killed them and tortured them, crucified them.

00:28:52.517 --> 00:28:59.517
But now, please, all of you try to understand

00:28:59.892 --> 00:29:02.267
the value of your life.

00:29:03.517 --> 00:29:05.767
Why are you a human being?

00:29:06.142 --> 00:29:08.017
Why are you created?

00:29:08.642 --> 00:29:10.642
What is the purpose behind it?

00:29:10.892 --> 00:29:15.517
Are we going to be driven by nonsensical ideas?

00:29:17.367 --> 00:29:26.742
Are we going to be finished by all sorts of dividing factors?

00:29:26.767 --> 00:29:31.517
No, no, we are all going to get your Self-realization,

00:29:32.767 --> 00:29:36.142
and we are going to understand the value of our life.

00:29:38.142 --> 00:29:42.267
The problem is, you'll get your realization

00:29:42.642 --> 00:29:46.517
in the sense the power within you will rise.

00:29:46.892 --> 00:29:48.766
It's very well organized;

00:29:49.142 --> 00:29:52.267
actually, God is a great creator.

00:29:52.766 --> 00:29:58.517
How He has balanced and how it works out is remarkable.

00:29:59.017 --> 00:30:01.766
Every individual He has done it.

00:30:02.267 --> 00:30:07.267
With that happening, is not sufficient.

00:30:08.766 --> 00:30:11.766
You enter into, say, a palace

00:30:12.267 --> 00:30:15.767
and then you go round and see for yourself

00:30:16.267 --> 00:30:18.642
how beautiful you are,

00:30:19.142 --> 00:30:22.392
what beautiful things God has made for you.

00:30:23.892 --> 00:30:26.392
Then grow into it.

00:30:26.766 --> 00:30:29.517
Once you have grown into it,

00:30:30.017 --> 00:30:35.392
then you will realize what a great thing you are:

00:30:36.642 --> 00:30:44.766
the greatest gem, the greatest person, so loving.

00:30:46.017 --> 00:30:47.766
There have been some

00:30:48.267 --> 00:30:51.392
-- they have become just statues.

00:30:51.767 --> 00:30:57.267
Nobody tries to understand what were they doing,

00:30:57.766 --> 00:30:59.392
how they were there.

00:31:02.551 --> 00:31:10.425
So, tonight we can have the experience,

00:31:11.142 --> 00:31:14.766
the experience of the spirit.

00:31:15.142 --> 00:31:18.892
Is a very unusual, rare thing.

00:31:19.392 --> 00:31:21.267
It never used to happen like that.

00:31:21.766 --> 00:31:25.267
But it is now, so why not take advantage of it?

00:31:27.517 --> 00:31:31.642
Please, be ready for that,

00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:36.142
accept it, take it, and become.

00:31:36.766 --> 00:31:38.767
Becoming is the point.

00:31:39.267 --> 00:31:41.767
What you become is the point.

00:31:42.267 --> 00:31:48.517
And what you make out of this whole human civilization

00:31:49.017 --> 00:31:52.642
is your problem, not Mine.

00:31:53.892 --> 00:31:56.267
I can help you.

00:31:56.766 --> 00:31:58.766
I can work it out.

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:06.142
So I would request you all to now be ready for Self-realization.

00:32:08.767 --> 00:32:10.766
It's much better,

00:32:11.267 --> 00:32:14.767
but those who do not want to have cannot be forced.

00:32:16.766 --> 00:32:19.642
So it's better such people leave,

00:32:20.017 --> 00:32:23.142
leave the hall if they don't want to have.

00:32:26.767 --> 00:32:28.766
May God bless you all.

00:32:55.766 --> 00:32:58.392
Firstly, you don't have to do anything

00:33:01.267 --> 00:33:04.766
-- meaning also, don't think what I have said.

00:33:07.267 --> 00:33:12.142
Try to keep your thoughts very peaceful,

00:33:13.517 --> 00:33:17.642
and I'm sure all of you can get your Self-realization.

00:33:19.267 --> 00:33:21.766
But how many will grow?

00:33:22.267 --> 00:33:26.767
Because you have to come to the follow-up,

00:33:28.267 --> 00:33:32.392
then you have to practice it in the centers

00:33:32.892 --> 00:33:35.517
-- and it works out.

00:33:36.017 --> 00:33:39.892
Little bit time you have to give to yourself,

00:33:40.766 --> 00:33:44.142
and to this global problem.

00:33:45.766 --> 00:33:48.142
You have to dedicate yourself to that.

00:33:48.766 --> 00:33:52.766
Is very important: you have to dedicate yourself.

00:33:53.392 --> 00:33:56.642
That doesn't mean that you have to become sanyasi

00:33:56.892 --> 00:34:00.017
or you have to be busy with this for twenty-four hours -- nothing.

00:34:00.642 --> 00:34:06.142
But this dedication will make you so much

00:34:08.142 --> 00:34:09.892
one with yourself,

00:34:10.517 --> 00:34:12.766
with the whole universe,

00:34:13.267 --> 00:34:16.892
that I don't have to tell you that you dedicate

00:34:17.392 --> 00:34:20.392
-- you'll dedicate by yourself.

00:34:23.766 --> 00:34:26.766
So please don't stay here

00:34:27.017 --> 00:34:29.392
if you don't want to have Self-realization.

00:34:29.892 --> 00:34:31.767
Nothing will happen to you.

00:34:32.392 --> 00:34:37.642
Please leave the hall in case you don't want Self-realization.

00:34:51.017 --> 00:34:56.767
What you have to do is not to do anything;

00:34:58.517 --> 00:35:01.142
to put just your hands towards Me.

00:35:03.142 --> 00:35:06.142
Of course, if you are wearing shoes better take them out,

00:35:06.766 --> 00:35:09.642
because Mother Earth is very important.

00:35:11.142 --> 00:35:13.767
Please put both the hands towards Me.

00:35:27.767 --> 00:35:29.767
You don't have to pray,

00:35:30.267 --> 00:35:31.766
you don't have to say anything; just

00:35:32.267 --> 00:35:34.766
put your hands towards Me, just like this.

00:35:48.767 --> 00:35:51.766
Now please close your eyes.

00:35:52.392 --> 00:35:57.517
It is important. Please close your eyes.

00:36:07.392 --> 00:36:12.267
This power, kundalini, is placed in the triangular bone,

00:36:14.766 --> 00:36:18.766
known as sacrum, means "sacred",

00:36:19.267 --> 00:36:28.267
and it rises through six centers of the parasympathetic,

00:36:28.767 --> 00:36:32.267
and ultimately pierces through

00:36:36.392 --> 00:36:39.267
the fontanel bone area

00:36:39.642 --> 00:36:42.017
which was a soft bone in your head,

00:36:42.766 --> 00:36:45.017
on top of your head.

00:36:50.017 --> 00:36:53.267
When you were a child, it was a soft bone.

00:36:53.767 --> 00:36:56.766
It pierces through that,

00:36:58.517 --> 00:37:01.392
and enters into the subtle energy

00:37:03.392 --> 00:37:10.892
of all-pervading Power of divine love.

00:37:13.766 --> 00:37:16.517
They call it by different name.

00:37:17.017 --> 00:37:22.142
They call it "Paramachaitanya" -- some call it "chaitanya."

00:37:23.766 --> 00:37:27.142
Some call it as "ruh."

00:37:27.766 --> 00:37:33.766
You may call it by any name -- is the love, love of God.

00:37:35.517 --> 00:37:37.767
Once you get connected with you,

00:37:39.142 --> 00:37:43.142
when you start feeling on your fingers

00:37:45.392 --> 00:37:47.267
some sort of a breeze.

00:37:47.766 --> 00:37:50.766
First some people will get hot, doesn't matter;

00:37:52.267 --> 00:37:54.392
but then it cools down

00:37:54.766 --> 00:37:58.517
and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

00:38:01.142 --> 00:38:03.267
And it starts flowing.

00:38:05.142 --> 00:38:08.767
You can now raise your left hand

00:38:09.267 --> 00:38:12.892
on top of your fontanel bone area.

00:38:13.517 --> 00:38:16.766
Keep your eyes shut, and see for yourself

00:38:17.017 --> 00:38:21.517
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

00:38:31.642 --> 00:38:33.392
You can move your hand.

00:38:36.642 --> 00:38:38.892
Now see with your right hand

00:38:39.766 --> 00:38:42.392
if there's a cool or a hot breeze

00:38:42.766 --> 00:38:45.892
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

00:38:46.392 --> 00:38:49.267
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:38:49.766 --> 00:38:51.267
See for yourself.

00:38:51.642 --> 00:38:53.892
Bend your head; better is to bend.

00:38:54.517 --> 00:38:56.517
Please bend your head.

00:38:58.267 --> 00:39:01.517
Again put your right hand towards Me

00:39:03.017 --> 00:39:08.767
and see for yourself with the left hand,

00:39:09.392 --> 00:39:15.267
see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:39:15.766 --> 00:39:18.767
If it is hot it's all right, doesn't matter.

00:39:19.267 --> 00:39:22.642
It is coming because of the heat within you.

00:39:39.142 --> 00:39:44.142
Now all those who have felt cool or a hot breeze

00:39:44.766 --> 00:39:47.267
in their hands or on their fingers,

00:39:47.766 --> 00:39:50.392
or out of the fontanel bone area

00:39:50.766 --> 00:39:52.766
-- this is the real baptism --

00:39:52.892 --> 00:39:55.766
please raise both your hands.

00:40:04.766 --> 00:40:06.142
Just imagine:

00:40:06.766 --> 00:40:10.642
you are the soldiers who are going to save the world

00:40:11.642 --> 00:40:13.766
from its destruction.

00:40:14.267 --> 00:40:16.392
Try to understand your importance.

00:40:17.892 --> 00:40:20.392
You can put down your hand.

00:40:20.767 --> 00:40:24.766
Everyone practically has felt it.

00:40:25.267 --> 00:40:27.267
That means you are already matured

00:40:27.766 --> 00:40:29.642
to get your spiritual life.

00:40:29.892 --> 00:40:32.642
You are just on the brink of it.

00:40:33.142 --> 00:40:35.267
That's how you got it.

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:40.767
It's last jump to reality.

00:40:41.267 --> 00:40:45.766
Now, you should know what is this, what are you,

00:40:46.766 --> 00:40:48.767
what is your spirit

00:40:49.767 --> 00:40:53.642
and what you can do; what are your powers are,

00:40:53.892 --> 00:40:56.017
what are spiritual powers.

00:40:56.517 --> 00:40:58.267
For this I would request you

00:40:58.766 --> 00:41:01.142
to first to come to the follow-up program,

00:41:01.642 --> 00:41:06.392
and after that you can join any one of the centers

00:41:06.766 --> 00:41:09.892
which are closer to you and work it out.

00:41:10.517 --> 00:41:12.767
We have to work for the whole world.

00:41:14.267 --> 00:41:16.767
You should know there are eighty-five countries

00:41:17.267 --> 00:41:19.766
which are following Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:20.267 --> 00:41:25.517
And surprisingly, black country like Benin,

00:41:25.767 --> 00:41:28.766
we have twenty thousand Sahaja yogis.

00:41:29.142 --> 00:41:31.892
Only three years back I started there.

00:41:32.392 --> 00:41:36.766
And in England it's more than sixteen years

00:41:37.267 --> 00:41:41.767
I've been working here, and after that also:

00:41:42.267 --> 00:41:44.892
all the time, every year.

00:41:45.517 --> 00:41:47.017
But somehow

00:41:52.642 --> 00:41:57.392
their growth is very much there,

00:41:58.766 --> 00:42:06.517
but not subtle growth, not within ourselves.

00:42:10.767 --> 00:42:16.517
The growth is within, and you'll enjoy,

00:42:17.017 --> 00:42:19.766
very much enjoy the reality.

00:42:20.142 --> 00:42:23.892
The reality is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

00:42:25.517 --> 00:42:27.392
May God bless you.

00:42:32.017 --> 00:42:33.767
They want to sing one song

00:42:34.517 --> 00:42:38.017
which was written in the twelfth century

00:42:38.517 --> 00:42:41.766
by a saint in India and is sung in all the villages,

00:42:42.017 --> 00:42:44.642
but nobody knows the meaning of that.

00:42:45.767 --> 00:42:49.767
The meaning is that "Oh Mother,

00:42:50.392 --> 00:42:52.892
give me the union, 'Jogwa'

00:42:53.642 --> 00:42:54.892
-- give me the union.

00:42:56.267 --> 00:43:00.767
I will give up my bad habits. I'll give up my temper. I'll give ..."

00:43:01.392 --> 00:43:02.766
You don't have to do it.

00:43:03.017 --> 00:43:05.766
Now you'll give up automatically.

00:43:07.267 --> 00:43:10.142
The light that you'll have, itself,

00:43:10.517 --> 00:43:14.267
automatically you will give up, automatically.

00:43:14.766 --> 00:43:16.517
You don't have to do anything.

00:43:16.767 --> 00:43:19.517
But you have to meditate.

00:43:19.850 --> 00:43:23.766
About ten minutes, it's not much.
