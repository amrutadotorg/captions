00:00:09.957 --> 00:00:16.717
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja yogis.

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:41.438
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara should be opened out,

00:00:41.638 --> 00:00:53.150
but waiting for a right time.
It was important to do it at the right time.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:10.018
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me a question,

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:18.079
“Mother, this all-pervading Power of Brahmachaitanya

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:28.230
is beyond senses, you cannot feel it through senses.

00:01:29.307 --> 00:01:35.100
How is it we are now feeling it through our senses?”

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:43.577
This is the question he asked, and I ask you the same question.

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:57.627
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can tell people,

00:01:57.827 --> 00:02:02.957
that you can feel it on your senses.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:12.307
They could not explain, they could not put it into experience.

00:02:12.507 --> 00:02:20.207
Just what they did was to tell them in words,

00:02:20.407 --> 00:02:30.109
words which were telling about something,

00:02:30.356 --> 00:02:35.814
like the taste of mango, unless and until you eat the mango

00:02:36.014 --> 00:02:41.869
how will you know the taste? By just knowing
about “it’s wonderful, it’s great, it’s fantastic,”

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:48.764
still you have not tasted the mango.

00:02:49.686 --> 00:02:55.587
So what has happened now, was the question.

00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:58.807
Another thing was that these people got so fed up,

00:02:59.007 --> 00:03:04.397
like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one, he took a samadhi.

00:03:04.598 --> 00:03:12.837
He went into a room and closed the doors
and settled down there, and he died there.

00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:20.499
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:29.644
Because they could tell a parable, they
could tell a simile, but what had happened

00:03:30.147 --> 00:03:42.087
to them that they could not explain,
and they felt so sad and so frustrated.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:48.899
In a way they finished their life very early.

00:03:50.779 --> 00:03:54.004
This was the question.

00:03:59.803 --> 00:04:06.713
So what was the secret, can any one of you tell Me?

00:04:34.652 --> 00:04:44.073
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult to digest.

00:04:50.282 --> 00:05:03.314
The answer is that all these incarnations who came on this Earth

00:05:03.514 --> 00:05:14.748
were part of the Sahasrara, were part of the
Brahmachaitanya, were part of the Adi Shakti.

00:05:17.388 --> 00:05:26.549
They came on this Earth, gave realization to
some people who were excellent, good people

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:33.129
who had no problems; as if they came out of the ocean of love

00:05:33.329 --> 00:05:38.799
and took all of them to the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:44.933
As Kabira has said that “When a drop
becomes the ocean, what can I say?”

00:05:45.133 --> 00:05:48.749
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:57.095
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

00:05:57.296 --> 00:06:05.066
They disappeared, they got dissolved
completely into the ocean of love.

00:06:08.795 --> 00:06:12.789
But you did not get dissolved.

00:06:15.835 --> 00:06:28.054
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

00:06:28.568 --> 00:06:42.801
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

00:06:45.189 --> 00:06:52.380
to shower the chaitanya on you people,

00:06:53.991 --> 00:07:01.729
enrich you, nurture you, develop you,

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:17.872
by manifesting the love in such a manner that
you have entered into the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:21.984
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges,

00:07:22.184 --> 00:07:27.079
you are like a cell in the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.594
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

00:07:32.801 --> 00:07:41.047
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses

00:07:41.247 --> 00:07:47.331
and you can give realizations to others,
but you are in the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:47.532 --> 00:07:56.634
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti you can do all that.

00:07:56.835 --> 00:07:59.277
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

00:07:59.478 --> 00:08:06.925
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened
out with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

00:08:07.126 --> 00:08:09.431
who are just part and parcel of it.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:16.792
The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble,

00:08:16.992 --> 00:08:25.067
who is deceptive, illusive, who is Mahamaya.

00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:32.874
It’s the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and

00:08:33.074 --> 00:08:42.487
to the whole universe, that now you can get
your realization, you can give realizations to others,

00:08:42.687 --> 00:08:52.503
you can understand through your senses,
through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.

00:08:52.704 --> 00:09:00.950
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers were dead last night,

00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:06.445
finished with the heat of the people who were carrying them.

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:12.182
And then I just put some vibrated
water on them, and you see how they are.

00:09:12.383 --> 00:09:20.817
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but
their personality is there, they are all vibrated,

00:09:21.018 --> 00:09:25.552
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:35.766
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh and
beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja yogi.

00:09:35.886 --> 00:09:40.080
Under these circumstances one has to understand

00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:43.819
that there are certain limitations which you have to observe.

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:48.828
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

00:09:49.028 --> 00:09:57.913
A foreign thing has to go in the body
and it has to be looked after, nurtured.

00:09:59.207 --> 00:10:10.158
But if you become troublesome, then
you’ll be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

00:10:10.358 --> 00:10:14.738
Some people are extremely troublesome.

00:10:14.938 --> 00:10:23.597
They do not meditate, they have their own ideas about meditation,

00:10:23.797 --> 00:10:29.564
they do not develop themselves, they do not mature,

00:10:29.764 --> 00:10:36.383
they live in the past or in the future,

00:10:36.583 --> 00:10:39.045
and such people are troublesome.

00:10:39.246 --> 00:10:45.717
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to put some ghee in the nose,

00:10:45.918 --> 00:10:48.807
which is a very simple thing but is very important.

00:10:49.008 --> 00:10:58.945
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa,
and one of the things that is a symptom

00:10:59.145 --> 00:11:04.545
in a AIDS case is a bad Hamsa.

00:11:04.871 --> 00:11:16.548
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a
small thing like that is not observed.

00:11:16.748 --> 00:11:26.063
It has to be a religious obligation that
you must listen to Me, whatever I say.

00:11:26.264 --> 00:11:28.898
Actually you must obey Me.

00:11:29.098 --> 00:11:34.231
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet obey Me;

00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:40.526
what about you, who are raised to the great dignity

00:11:40.726 --> 00:11:54.796
and the great position of being the
yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

00:11:54.997 --> 00:12:02.263
and they are acting as cells in My body?

00:12:09.210 --> 00:12:15.823
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind of a venture,

00:12:16.023 --> 00:12:21.548
to put all kinds of things in your body

00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:30.457
is a very daring thing,

00:12:30.657 --> 00:12:37.340
and the process is also very hazardous.

00:12:38.738 --> 00:12:51.765
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

00:12:55.438 --> 00:13:05.127
This has to be regarded as the greatest
thing, that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

00:13:05.327 --> 00:13:13.968
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara,
I am the master of all the chakras,

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:20.360
but also I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

00:13:20.573 --> 00:13:27.098
If that is the situation, you should be
careful about your Sahasrara – that is Me –

00:13:27.299 --> 00:13:35.809
and looking after your own heart
which is the Brahmarandra peetha here,

00:13:36.009 --> 00:13:41.814
which opens out ultimately when you get your realization.

00:13:42.015 --> 00:13:49.968
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere
horizontally; vertically it must also spread.

00:13:50.168 --> 00:13:56.538
And there, if you really have proper understanding of what I am,

00:13:56.738 --> 00:13:59.627
Sahasrara should be absolutely clearcut.

00:13:59.827 --> 00:14:04.787
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you
must listen to whatever I have told you,

00:14:04.987 --> 00:14:12.781
obey it as absolutely a ordained thing.

00:14:17.657 --> 00:14:22.151
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your heart.

00:14:22.352 --> 00:14:29.209
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill it up with My love?

00:14:29.410 --> 00:14:34.671
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

00:14:36.446 --> 00:14:39.880
Don’t get worried about what has happened in the past,

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:44.888
don’t get worried about what has happened in your life

00:14:45.088 --> 00:14:50.294
as far as your relationships are concerned.

00:14:50.495 --> 00:14:57.445
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga, they cannot happen.

00:14:57.646 --> 00:15:01.207
It has been worked out that way, it cannot happen.

00:15:01.407 --> 00:15:06.618
If this hand is paining, the other hand is there to help it out.

00:15:06.819 --> 00:15:13.787
You’re not alone, you are in the body of the collective being.

00:15:13.988 --> 00:15:18.926
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic people,

00:15:19.126 --> 00:15:24.147
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such people.

00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:27.218
In Sanskrit language they are called as “mudhahs.”

00:15:27.419 --> 00:15:32.220
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart

00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:39.941
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence has that capacity –

00:15:40.141 --> 00:15:46.228
and to indulge into things which are not Sahaj.

00:15:47.897 --> 00:15:51.359
Slowly you will find your vibrations will disappear,

00:15:51.559 --> 00:16:00.332
you’ll become sick, you’ll have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

00:16:00.532 --> 00:16:10.694
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:22.788
anybody tries to be troublesome in My
body I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

00:16:25.126 --> 00:16:30.961
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when every moment

00:16:31.161 --> 00:16:38.918
you are hanged onto a cross by anyone who wants to do it.

00:16:41.891 --> 00:16:46.780
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands to torture My life,

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:51.193
to trouble Me if they want to;

00:16:51.393 --> 00:16:59.543
but they have also such a capacity, such a caliber,

00:16:59.743 --> 00:17:06.269
such a potential that they can reside in My heart forever.

00:17:06.403 --> 00:17:10.690
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will say.

00:17:11.998 --> 00:17:22.021
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead a life of collectivity.

00:17:22.222 --> 00:17:27.808
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

00:17:28.008 --> 00:17:33.958
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this is mine, and this I own.”

00:17:34.159 --> 00:17:37.100
Even about children you should not do like that,

00:17:37.300 --> 00:17:48.818
“This is my own child, this is my own
baby. This is my brother, this is my sister.”

00:17:49.018 --> 00:17:52.695
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s not possible,

00:17:52.895 --> 00:17:59.918
it’s not easy to forget about it because
left Nabhi and right Nabhi has to be all right.

00:18:00.118 --> 00:18:07.193
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s all Yours.”

00:18:07.393 --> 00:18:16.367
It’s not dangerous to say that, because I’ll
never take anything that is supposed to be yours.

00:18:16.568 --> 00:18:21.743
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,” to start it – “It’s all Yours.

00:18:21.944 --> 00:18:29.108
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all
my things are Yours, my life is Yours.”

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:34.238
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

00:18:34.438 --> 00:18:40.096
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,

00:18:40.296 --> 00:18:45.021
extremely simple, and can be moved with very little actions,

00:18:45.221 --> 00:18:49.027
can be pleased with very few little actions here and there.

00:18:49.228 --> 00:18:53.585
Not much is needed to please the deity of Sahasrara.

00:18:53.786 --> 00:19:02.858
It’s a very simple person; little things make Her happy.

00:19:03.672 --> 00:19:08.537
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and I didn’t take them.

00:19:08.745 --> 00:19:10.112
You all must have thought,

00:19:10.312 --> 00:19:13.971
“What’s it, we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding in our hand.”

00:19:14.172 --> 00:19:18.959
But I wanted to show this miracle to you, that’s why I didn’t take.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:24.484
And I took it in the end, and see now
they are the best among all of them;

00:19:24.684 --> 00:19:29.472
don’t they look as if they have been plucked from the tree?

00:19:30.608 --> 00:19:35.709
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m tired,” I sat down

00:19:35.909 --> 00:19:42.921
and then I looked at you with the flowers,
you see, in the hands, you’re sitting all of you!

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.498
So She is Leela Vinodini.

00:19:54.698 --> 00:20:02.836
She plays around, makes little mischiefs
here and there for you to learn lessons.

00:20:03.030 --> 00:20:09.640
Because if I tell you “Do this” then
it’s not possible, but little circuitous way

00:20:09.841 --> 00:20:14.252
I can show you that this is wrong, you should not do it.

00:20:14.453 --> 00:20:18.123
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have taken all the flowers;

00:20:18.323 --> 00:20:23.063
but somebody must have thought of it,
why Mother has not taken the flowers today.

00:20:23.264 --> 00:20:27.603
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,

00:20:27.803 --> 00:20:34.385
but I knew it Myself that I have to take
the flowers to show this miracle to them,

00:20:34.585 --> 00:20:38.929
that these flowers are going to last
much longer than any other flowers,

00:20:39.129 --> 00:20:43.900
because they are vibrated with the Brahmachaitanya.

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:49.717
And the water was very, very, very
cold, so even I opened a hot water tap.

00:20:49.918 --> 00:20:57.790
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

00:20:57.990 --> 00:21:01.906
So you have seen so many miracles of this Brahmachaitanya

00:21:02.106 --> 00:21:07.653
which is showing on your photographs, on so many your lives,

00:21:07.853 --> 00:21:12.207
in so many changes that have taken place within yourself,

00:21:12.407 --> 00:21:16.450
within your family, within every one of you.

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:21.359
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:27.090
All this you are receiving because you are blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

00:21:27.545 --> 00:21:31.667
But others are not, so your attitude should be towards them

00:21:31.868 --> 00:21:36.037
that they are in the other world – what to do, how to help them?

00:21:36.238 --> 00:21:41.800
We should try to help them if possible, but up to a point.

00:21:42.250 --> 00:21:45.423
We should not drag down ourselves for others’ sake.

00:21:45.623 --> 00:21:48.044
Up to a point only we can help them,

00:21:48.244 --> 00:21:53.950
and we have to be very happy that Sahaja
Yoga is spreading so much horizontally.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:58.790
But for vertical thing we must know our quality must improve.

00:21:58.991 --> 00:22:04.164
If some people rise higher, others will also start rising with them.

00:22:04.365 --> 00:22:09.640
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should be there,

00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:13.170
absolutely understanding should be there.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:17.525
Open your hearts to each other, so that you open your hearts to Me.

00:22:17.726 --> 00:22:22.932
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise it won’t work out.

00:22:23.133 --> 00:22:28.843
That is a great thing that has happened, when you are on this Earth,

00:22:29.043 --> 00:22:35.225
when you are the ones who have to receive this great blessing.

00:22:35.426 --> 00:22:39.219
So many saints did not receive it,

00:22:39.419 --> 00:22:43.347
so many great people who came on this Earth, they did not receive it.

00:22:43.548 --> 00:22:49.527
Even the incarnations who came on this
Earth could not do it what you are doing.

00:22:49.728 --> 00:22:54.009
So have that satisfaction and glory

00:22:54.209 --> 00:22:58.618
of your own being and of your own standard, and of your own caliber.

00:22:58.819 --> 00:23:03.780
The others are not of your caliber, all right, forget about it.

00:23:04.258 --> 00:23:12.167
That should not give you ego, but should
give you a personality that does not react.

00:23:12.368 --> 00:23:18.200
We have something of our own, we do not react to things.

00:23:20.077 --> 00:23:23.401
We are not reactionaries.

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:28.040
And things will disappear which are harmful.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:31.411
Everything will be perfectly all right,

00:23:31.611 --> 00:23:36.582
because we are standing in our own perfection, in our own glory.

00:23:36.782 --> 00:23:38.215
What do we need?

00:23:38.415 --> 00:23:41.493
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

00:23:44.713 --> 00:23:47.306
May God bless you all.
