00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:10.100
Vinugopalan sir has explained very nicely to you
that the Kundalini within, within us,

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.000
is the power without awakening of which one
can't even get anything, can't get

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:26.033
anything and there's no way because to
attain God, to know God

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.080
it is necessary to know the Soul. Unless the Soul is known,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.200
one cannot
know God. Because the Soul is the power to

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.080
know God; Like without opening our eyes we
can't see the world the same way

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.460
everything is useless until our soul awakens.
God cannot be known through useless talk,

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.520
It's true, there is no doubt about it.
Even if people get angry, or feel bad too

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.850
even then whatever is right, we have to say the same thing and in that

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.510
there is nothing to feel bad about because
If you have set out in search of

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.790
God, if you are searching only for Him, what is
said that

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:16.130
You are a true seeker, in your heart you have only
 the thought of meeting God then

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:24.127
only we can talk to you and the rest cannot
be talked about, the reason is this

00:01:24.177 --> 00:01:31.245
that man does not know that he
is not yet connected to his soul.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.270
The soul knows you, you know not the soul. Its
not connected with you.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:44.253
Your conscious is not yet enlightened.
Not even the slightest; When our innerself

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:53.782
gets enlightened, then the power itself starts
flowing from within you, this is a fact.

00:01:53.832 --> 00:02:01.790
And it's a living process.
A living process, the way

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.580
you evolved from amoeba to human, the same
way you can become higher than even
 a human being,

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.600
but you will become the same way; man
finds new-new ways for anything.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.780
God has his own way of doing it. He has
 already ready set everything inside you,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.220
it is just a matter connecting yourself.
Unless there is a connection with God, there is

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.032
no connection with the soul, then what is
the benefit of doing the rest of all these things?

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:36.960
Understand, if its not having any connection with the
Main, what is the use of me talking over it?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.713
He just came, that  Pai Sahab and said. Come
on, I'll just go and make the connection right now.

00:02:41.747 --> 00:02:46.700
A very practical, logical thing required to be
said is that right now you do not have any

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.140
connection with the soul, your soul within
is not yet enlightened. Now many people

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.520
will say that mother should first clean the
candle. Even if keep the candle clean, whether you

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.180
rub it or clean it, but If there is no light
inside then there what’s the candle

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.960
going to mean, either? What for to work hard,
but it doesn't seem interesting.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:14.380
If it is said that not with any hard work.
because what we understand that,

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:22.346
We say ‘I like it'; In Marathi it is said
'mala thara - unclear'

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:29.910
Who is this, who says that I Like? -
This is your ego, it is ego that

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.050
says, I like this I got this
benefit from it, I got that

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:40.380
benefit from it, what a benefit, just
Your ego is ego. That's something.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.840
‘That’ is something!

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:49.920
When the ego swells, when we
feed the ego, it becomes happy.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.820
It happens.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.140
And which is the
superego, the superego.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.580
because of that you get sorrow.

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:00.540
By conditioning you get hurt and
When you do deconditioning then your ego

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:01.220
Gets inflated.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.740
Beyond these there is God,
beyond these there is the soul.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:17.702
God who is the controller of the Universe,
has well arranged it inside you.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.640
You may believe it
or not, but it’s there.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.480
Why don't you agree?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.640
Because you didn't see him, you
don't know him, you don't recognize him. But

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:34.180
at least, in our own India great people
have been there, like Adi Shankaracharya

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.490
They told that inside you exists
Kundalini Shakti; Kabir was there.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.540
In its entirety, Kabir, Nanak, Gyaneshwar, everyone
has said that awakening of Kundalini Shakti is

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:48.300
Needed

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.640
That’s the only one task.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.620
Finally everyone talks about the Kundalini, they talk about
the chakra, everyone talks

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:58.500
the same thing.

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.510
But Kundalini is not awakened, what is the use of
doing such talk, even if we talk to you about the

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.110
Whole world, what benefit is going to
Happen; talking will remain a matter of discussion.

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:19.910
What benefit did you get from the
Talk; You look for self, look at

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.190
the meaning of 'self', 'self' is
your spirit; Did you get it’s meaning?

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:30.140
it means that is your ‘self ’

00:05:30.173 --> 00:05:37.940
Activated, what for it is meant. Is it acting somehow?
Or that it is lying aside and you are as you were.

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:43.656
This should be thought of first that if we are really

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.600
seeking God, we are honest in this matter,
and We are searching for God only,

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.690
We are not looking for our ego;
If you put forth such a thought in front

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:02.150
and then think, what do we need
 to do for this? Because whatever

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.770
action we do, will our ego be bound or not?
Whether you will be bound by karma or not,

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:14.450
some event has to happen inside

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.610
and that is a living event, Spontaneous.
You can't get it done; Standing on your head

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.370
Can you grow seeds?

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.270
Can you grow seeds by reading Geeta?

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:28.470
Can you grow seeds by chanting mantras?

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.750
Can you grow seeds by jumping?

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:36.350
By reading books, giving money to gurus; From
shaving all that head and wearing saintly apparels,

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:38.770
can you do by wearing it?

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.470
Kabir has hit everyone hard.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:46.700
You can't do it by doing all this.

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.320
There should be inner awareness.

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:51.380
Samadhi is spontaneous!

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:53.300
It should be comfortable inside.

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.540
Recently a Saheb also invented
Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.920
That means the height, how many ways
 to earn money, people come up with?

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.380
And there is no limit of befooling.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.920
Because people are idiots.

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:10.100
One, who is a real man
few people will come to
him.

00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:12.480
The first identity is this.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.335
Very few people will come
near the one who is real.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.900
Because there happen to be very few,
Who value the real one.

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:20.675
People die for copied things.

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:24.227
If you ask for making the flowers out of plastic,
thousands will be made.

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.460
Come on brother, make me a
member, he also become, you are adored

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:29.660
with a gown, now you are a member.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:31.540
Come, now you become his disciple.

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:39.058
neither do we have any disciples
nor do we have any sect.

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:43.920
If you want to transcend then you come
and get transcended.

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:46.080
Nor can you give money in
this.

00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:50.900
A thing that should be thought about is, the thing for
which you give money, how can that be God?

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:55.620
In temples! Money is taken; Pope takes money
and all around the world

00:07:55.620 --> 00:07:59.880
the Acharyas take money. So all
people think if Mata ji

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.155
does not take money, then what
use will it be?

00:08:03.180 --> 00:08:07.175
I ask how much money do you have?

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:10.266
What can you give me?

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.935
What at all do you have to give?

00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:18.255
what kind of thing do you have that
can pay for it?

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:25.965
These stones and pieces,
will you price it for?

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:31.290
And with any kind of feeling will
you attain God?

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:36.596
How did I abandon my home?

00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:40.065
All this is mental hoarding.

00:08:40.090 --> 00:08:42.190
Which is called Bodhi Acro Bats,

00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:47.750
that I left the house, I left
the door, gave up the whole

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:51.245
world; Why did God create
the world it was to be renounced?

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:58.309
This exodus,

00:08:58.333 --> 00:09:04.291
what is the need for it?
This is needed as the
humans quickly fall into this trap.

00:09:04.324 --> 00:09:11.160
When someone is asked to see that
while living in your own world,
living in the household

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.195
this happens with in you, he
thinks what is there in that then?

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:21.000
Where did I show off, where did I show off
myself, and if you are really willing to attain

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.741
Then you will say let’s go

00:09:25.766 --> 00:09:28.695
In these external things, in external
in ostentation, there is nothing!

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:32.800
And these people will also tell you that there is
Nothing outside, everything is inside and will get done.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.363
Minding everything outside and you
will be lost in it.

00:09:37.413 --> 00:09:44.347
It’s pity that you are the seeker, you are
the infinite. You have been searching for

00:09:44.397 --> 00:09:53.478
God since time immemorial and the bigger
sorrow is that in this abundance You too will perish.

00:09:53.511 --> 00:10:00.320
What is a living action is the power, ability and
God has created its entire creation within you. ,

00:10:03.444 --> 00:10:07.080
Just think about what you have done.
Now that we have built massive building, then thinking

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.780
That Sahab! We have constructed massive building;
These stones have been laid one upon the other,
Which

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:15.629
living process has been performed here!

00:10:15.663 --> 00:10:18.746
What else have you done except to
make the dead out of dead?

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:24.135
Is there even a single living act that
the man has done? So tell me;

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.643
living work is performed only by the man

00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:32.990
who gets soul, this is the key to finding
your soul is that your

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:38.790
Hands will do living acts. Kundalini awakening is a
living act. This can be seen by your eyes

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:45.730
its pulsation; it’s dancing, it’s rise and fall
you can see with your own eyes.

00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:53.820
The act that you can do, that very well, like

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.460
Someone says to sit in meditation, sit with
your fingers like this, sit with nose

00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.760
like this then you can very well do. There
is nothing special. If someone says that raise one leg

00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.380
and sit; with little practice you can do that too.
If some say, jump on a horse

00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:08.240
and sit, as far as you can, jump, a
little higher

00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:12.005
and that can also happen.

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:15.705
There is a sir, he These days you are
teaching someone flying, hey brother,

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.540
do you want to become a bird? There is one
sahib who started jumping like a frog. I

00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.780
said, why jump like a
frog? He said, my guru said that if your
Kundalini

00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:28.103
awakens, you will jump like a frog. I said
tomorrow you will climb a snake and crawl.

00:11:28.136 --> 00:11:33.880
What are you going to be now? What! are you going
to be a snake, going to be frogs or bird

00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:37.920
going to be; why do you need to jump,
What is the need to shout and scream,

00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.793
what for?

00:11:39.818 --> 00:11:45.067
If that power resides within
you, then respect yourself.

00:11:45.084 --> 00:11:49.117
Understand about yourself that
the God has crafted so

00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:58.440
Beautifully your this human body. His artwork is very
delicate and in that

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:03.874
Artwork He has so beautifully placed that
Kundalini that no one can touch it.

00:12:03.907 --> 00:12:10.340
Placed in the triangular bone. Triangular bone, to
your surprise, you can't burn.

00:12:10.340 --> 00:12:14.900
Even the bone cannot be burnt; no matter
Kundalini leaves it, you can not

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:21.140
turn it to ashes. incinerated with great
difficulty through electrolysis etc.

00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:25.073
it turns in ashes, even then

00:12:25.098 --> 00:12:31.240
its Atoms are of a different kind.

00:12:31.265 --> 00:12:38.190
Its name itself is Sacrum;
look at that time people, in Latin language,

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:43.831
In such ancient times

00:12:43.856 --> 00:12:49.840
they called it sacrum, Greeks
Called it sacrum.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:56.410
It means that it is most pious thing.

00:12:56.435 --> 00:12:59.394
People did its calculation, its imagination

00:12:59.427 --> 00:13:07.408
even at that time, in a country like Greek.

00:13:07.441 --> 00:13:12.141
In this,
God created the place for this Kundalini.
What a beautiful creation!

00:13:12.175 --> 00:13:13.985
Why after all?

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:17.930
You also say, “ Mother!  what is important just
as we were made an amoeba, we also could have

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:26.240
made God too! make us a soul too;
But in transformation from amoeba to Human being

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.500
Your this consciousness has kept growing,
this has matured, you became Human.

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:35.480
How much difference is there between you and the
Animal, you don’t know? sometimes

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:39.460
you can act like animals. If you want, you
can become a scorpion and if you want, you

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:45.260
become a lion, that's for another
thing but even then between you and the animal difference

00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:50.540
remains; You take a horse from some dirty
drainage, this to him

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:57.167
doesn't matter; you take any human, he will
close his nose, he can’t go.

00:13:57.217 --> 00:14:02.030
Beauty about which I have said, animals do
not have thoughts it;

00:14:02.030 --> 00:14:08.810
It is present in humans, although sometimes
it is quite external and above all

00:14:08.810 --> 00:14:14.950
the biggest thing is that the Human must have an
attraction towards the soul. Only humans can

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:20.750
Have a pull for the Soul, not animals.

00:14:20.767 --> 00:14:24.566
When Your conscious has became so intense, when your

00:14:24.590 --> 00:14:30.824
special consciousness

00:14:30.841 --> 00:14:36.236
Nurtures you or adores you,

00:14:36.260 --> 00:14:42.293
that consciousness itself
should know what is God.

00:14:42.327 --> 00:14:44.810
If an animal knows what God is,

00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.773
what would be the benefit ?

00:14:48.807 --> 00:14:55.590
The conscious of man when its full freedom

00:14:55.623 --> 00:15:03.520
Out to God and invokes Him, only  then the bliss of
the soul

00:15:03.553 --> 00:15:05.928
illuminates its consciousness, it’s mind.

00:15:05.953 --> 00:15:13.883
Illuminates it.

00:15:13.916 --> 00:15:20.333
it meditates [Marathi..]

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:24.896
To understand that light, man's

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.566
consciousness was
increased from one side.

00:15:29.583 --> 00:15:31.450
Now this is, we are speaking through this.
This

00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:37.600
Is Connected, everything is fine but does
this thing know what we are,

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:44.315
what is this we are saying? Understand, by continually
increasing this thing, a human came into being,

00:15:44.356 --> 00:15:47.315
and then

00:15:47.340 --> 00:15:54.190
The thing that is human being, If becomes
connected to God, he will know

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:58.720
what God is.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:06.560
So inside you, inside the human being in his
full freedom, completely in your freedom

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:12.260
Only this event takes place. By mesmerising or by
useless talks this does not happen.

00:16:12.260 --> 00:16:14.440
Understand, whatsoever speeches I
might have given, what is the use?

00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:19.520
What benefit do you get from reading a book,
unless you have transcended; you shouldn’t

00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:24.320
believe me either. In our Sahaja Yoga to come
on my feet, until You transcend,

00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.875
It’s not permitted.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:32.055
Why should you bow your head before me!

00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:38.613
Until you get realised; Without transcending
you won’t have any faith in anything.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:42.235
There will be no benefit in
coming forward without inner faith.

00:16:42.260 --> 00:16:47.740
The faith that is completely Enlighted,
that is real faith.

00:16:47.740 --> 00:16:50.660
So there are two words-
Faith and blind faith.

00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:56.993
Otherwise, thousands of people
are going like sheep and goats, and so we are.

00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:02.020
Once a father told his children that

00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.496
where everyone
else goes, it is better to go there.

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:08.540
So when the boys grew up, were short of
intelligence; he saw that many people

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:16.313
were going to one side, so let's go, followed them,
those people were going to the cemetery.

00:17:16.339 --> 00:17:21.180
Similarly, man should understand that, there
should be some abstract intelligence within us,

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:24.319
there should be discretion.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:30.015
A person who has no discretion,
tell me what Sahaja Yoga will do for him.

00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:35.815
He should understand that what is
real and what is imitation?

00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:40.442
you want an immitation or the original,
first thing.

00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:47.376
Because imitation is not going to make any sense,
you will throw that away in a few days.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:52.100
You see all the imitations
are getting exposed;

00:17:52.100 --> 00:17:55.260
one after the other they are getting to know.
So, they murdered him, they were killed

00:17:55.260 --> 00:17:59.720
there, they ran away from there, ten families got
ruined, this has gone bad, that has gone bad.

00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:05.180
because whatever imitation will get created
in His name, is going to be destructive,

00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:09.990
that will destroy you,

00:18:10.024 --> 00:18:13.825
and that will be orogonal in the name of God
it will be constructive,

00:18:13.850 --> 00:18:20.288
that will make you, flourish you, raise you.

00:18:20.322 --> 00:18:23.705
therefore, man should first decide whether he

00:18:23.729 --> 00:18:29.080
wants real or imitation.

00:18:29.105 --> 00:18:34.002
Gold, we want real,

00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:41.969
Then you go to Calcutta.
So there is shop for real gold and silver.

00:18:42.002 --> 00:18:44.520
In the matters of Gold

00:18:44.580 --> 00:18:52.546
we are  very particular in the, real ‘Marathi-Cholas’,
 [Marathi- चौविशिस का असल
पाइज, मराठी तक दू, पतलिया, -unclear]

00:18:52.580 --> 00:19:00.040
and about god I, all those,
who have such misconceptions,

00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:05.260
Sahaja Yoga is not for them. ‘Sahaja Yoga’, this is
the work of real heroes; For wasteful useless

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:09.335
people, Sahaja Yoga is not meant. May you be a
minister, else be President of somewhere,

00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:15.224
else be something; It’s the work of real heroes.
Those who are real brave, may come forward.

00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:20.300
and Sahaja Yoga is not for the useless people. You
only tell me if in front of you many broken

00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:29.736
lamps, chips are lying, do you repair it?

00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:34.355
Only that lamp is repaired, and that lamp is
made well, in which

00:19:34.405 --> 00:19:37.655
the lamp can be well lit.

00:19:37.688 --> 00:19:43.219
Because money doesn't work here,
Nothing works, what works?

00:19:43.302 --> 00:19:50.280
Sustenance, stability, it is called in Marathi
‘ Baithak’, many people transcended in Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:56.933
here in  Bombay at least fifteen
thousand people are realised, fifteen thousand.

00:19:56.967 --> 00:20:04.740
but how many are there who settle down, grow like tree.
At the most a thousand, who have settled down and

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:09.140
became its trees, those who have mastered it,
There are not more than a thousand such people, the rest

00:20:09.140 --> 00:20:13.420
will become waste, what is going to happen of them?
Today only there was a lady saying, ‘Mother

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:16.560
you made me transcend, now
I am having pain here, and

00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:22.720
and I am having this and that; She was
transcended some eleven years ago. So

00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.075
what’s now, now such a condition is happening, I
have lost my vibrations, now can't

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:33.154
do anything; What did she do
after getting realized.

00:20:33.179 --> 00:20:39.559
When your sprout

00:20:39.593 --> 00:20:45.790
becomes live, then how much its
needed to be flourished? You know, how much

00:20:45.827 --> 00:20:50.959
to cherish, how much to care. How is that

00:20:50.993 --> 00:20:58.959
With what effort It has to be raised.

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:03.926
That effort, that love, that understanding,

00:21:03.959 --> 00:21:10.300
It is necessary to be in you; today there are
many Sahaja Yogis are sitting, some of them came

00:21:10.300 --> 00:21:16.977
since long, some are from
forever, and some like that.

00:21:16.994 --> 00:21:20.215
and some new people too,

00:21:20.244 --> 00:21:24.736
To all of you I have only one thing to say,

00:21:24.761 --> 00:21:28.630
Sahaja Yoga takes you to the other end,
you

00:21:28.630 --> 00:21:34.610
become someone else, you become your soul.
You are no longer your ego, you

00:21:34.641 --> 00:21:39.666
become your soul, but your

00:21:39.691 --> 00:21:43.560
state which is there,
it has to be made. On that thing

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:47.572
you need to establish.

00:21:47.606 --> 00:21:52.022
in this case I would
say that the people of England,

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:58.600
It’s surprising, very surprising
that the people of England, who at one time

00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:04.787
showed so much power here,

00:22:04.804 --> 00:22:08.070
these people of England

00:22:08.103 --> 00:22:14.045
Firmly settled down,
did not only seek, settled also.

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:18.890
and we, for whom thousands of

00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:25.370
incarnations took birth here, especially made
this holy land so pure that the vibrations of

00:22:25.370 --> 00:22:32.550
consciousness are flowing in its viens,
in the people of that country that

00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:34.545
depth and intensity isn’t existing.

00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:39.691
It is a great surprise, I am very surprised myself.

00:22:39.730 --> 00:22:44.810
I took birth in India, especially in Maharashtra,
this is a sacred land.

00:22:44.843 --> 00:22:46.424
this is the land of saints.

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:49.745
Now Maharashtrian
people have also become ‘Sahib’.

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:56.355
The day Maharashtrian people become
‘Sahib’, your country is finished, take it.

00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:58.270
The day this happened, you were gone.

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:05.130
All the ashes means Ganpati is forgotten. All
Temples, get closed all temples, as many Ganpati

00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:08.150
Ashtavinayaks, that you have, lock them up.

00:23:12.970 --> 00:23:17.230
And the intellectuals, with their minds, have
come out with such things that you

00:23:17.230 --> 00:23:18.030
Get enticed on that.

00:23:19.010 --> 00:23:25.170
Now the era of fear is about to come, that’s a
great demon, who destroyed those countries,

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:30.650
but they recovered, and you People will not
recover, because the British have

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:35.890
taken that, so we should take it, they did wrong,
then we must be doing wrong thing.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:43.480
With this in mind, we lost
our all that thing whatever we had.

00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:50.520
Then these days new Gurus also have
emerged to cook up things, to refute

00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:58.375
Everything; some imitates Krishna, some
become something else, some something else.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:02.509
Becoming something doesn’t help,

00:24:02.523 --> 00:24:06.105
Krishna was there; If someone shows
His destructive power, we may recognise.

00:24:06.130 --> 00:24:10.730
A fellow came there, said, I am Krishna;
 I said, alright, walk on water, show.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:14.394
Krishna, the embodiment of Brahma, he imitated Him
when he reached in front of  me saying,” I am Krishna.”

00:24:14.430 --> 00:24:17.010
And ‘ thr thr thr thr’ in front of me,
Like this his body was behaving. Whole body

00:24:17.010 --> 00:24:24.990
‘lut lut lut’ trembling. He came depicting
like Krishna and he has a large following; as is said

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:30.410
big beard, he has kept like Krishna,
turned skeleton and roaming

00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:36.775
Around; I said that first Krishna
was not a skeleton, you idiot.

00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:43.270
If Krishna is a skeleton, then why
would he carry that large cross?

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:47.940
You made Him a skeleton, because
you couldn't appreciate His health,

00:24:47.940 --> 00:24:53.180
and you wanted to show Him such,
that Christ was weak, and the whole

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:57.575
world would say that why to be Christ?
We too shall become weak ‘Margilla’.

00:24:57.600 --> 00:25:03.375
Today they have said, But
what is this about Christ?

00:25:03.410 --> 00:25:10.060
The one that is called Raj [Bindawi-unclear],
What a physic, health, nice face

00:25:10.087 --> 00:25:13.087
and a glow was always visible on His face.

00:25:13.130 --> 00:25:18.958
What, you just imagine, the man who shaped
Himself in the shape and form of the world, He

00:25:18.983 --> 00:25:25.865
will be like this; like this He is depicted.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:32.410
Similarly, every kind of incarnation,
every kind of high things, all that was nobler

00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:36.696
in life, were all put down.

00:25:36.740 --> 00:25:42.768
And we also, like idiots,
follow these people.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.888
Yesterday someone asked me, what are
the symptoms, how to recognize?

00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.674
Which man is true and which is a liar?

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:58.479
First of all someone who take money
and organize, he is a big liar, a villain.

00:25:58.510 --> 00:26:03.190
To such a man, to his door one should never go, be

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:06.604
he call himself a Brahmin, whether he calls himself a
Pope, and whether someone sits as a Guru.

00:26:06.630 --> 00:26:12.350
The one who moves in cars on the on the cost of
others, and eats food in big platters and

00:26:12.350 --> 00:26:19.840
and drinks, such a man can never
be incarnation. All the incarnations

00:26:19.865 --> 00:26:23.850
have suffered for you,

00:26:23.875 --> 00:26:28.350
All the saints and sages have till date suffered.

00:26:28.350 --> 00:26:33.570
hardships to all the saints and sages, not only did
you cause pain, you people caused great

00:26:33.570 --> 00:26:39.250
torture. Jesus said, this I will forgive, whoever

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:45.330
persecuted, those who have not recognized
Me, I will forgive them, all that can be

00:26:45.330 --> 00:26:49.830
forgiven, but not against the Holy Spirit.

00:26:49.830 --> 00:26:56.090
If someone of you harasses Adi Shakti,
beware. But to torture Adi Shakti,

00:26:56.090 --> 00:27:00.090
none is born yet, even
to torture Jesus, no one was born.

00:27:00.340 --> 00:27:04.255
they played a drama,
because people were idiots.

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:10.420
Now you need to open your eyes
and What you need to understand is that

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.486
the treasure you are looking
for is within you;

00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:19.320
It is established inside you, find him.

00:27:19.350 --> 00:27:24.930
The most important thing for you is to get
it thing and if we are your real mother then

00:27:24.930 --> 00:27:29.034
we would like to give you what is real.
Will your mother ever give you a imitation?

00:27:29.059 --> 00:27:37.010
How will we give when your mother won't give?
But if we want to call it your ego, you

00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:44.010
are a very accomplished man, you are
such a wonderful man; such false ego will

00:27:44.010 --> 00:27:47.470
not to be promoted that later you see
a balloon is coming out of your head,

00:27:47.470 --> 00:27:51.390
and a horn comes out of it and
whomsoever you see,

00:27:51.390 --> 00:27:58.930
he is struck with that.
Whatever is truth is better to accept.

00:27:58.930 --> 00:28:06.830
it is difficult to
believe truth, It is very easy to accept
what is false.; that’s why all the hypocrites and liars

00:28:06.830 --> 00:28:14.060
flourish and it is so difficult for man
to believe the truth; Nor is it

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:20.820
that truth is not beautiful, truth is extremely
beautiful, it is such a precious thing, so much

00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:26.560
joyous thing but man does not
 accept this as in his ego he is

00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:32.839
enwrapped, he feels pleasure in his ego,
two or four apparels he got to

00:28:32.839 --> 00:28:37.180
wear, he feels proud, if he sees to ride
in a good car, his eyes

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.960
change. If he become a minister,
what to say, he has no time

00:28:40.997 --> 00:28:44.138
for any thing.

00:28:44.163 --> 00:28:47.472
Something that strengthens
his ego,

00:28:47.497 --> 00:28:52.720
Man remains in look out for that, but

00:28:52.720 --> 00:29:00.011
Its only momentary pleasure, momentary.

00:29:00.011 --> 00:29:02.644
Real joy,

00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:08.500
in which sorrow and happiness is not there;
There is only pleasure, just pleasure.

00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:15.500
As Venu Gopalan just told you
This is just what is called bliss, it is soul’s

00:29:15.525 --> 00:29:17.784
Happiness.

00:29:17.809 --> 00:29:25.667
Find the soul, don’t find your ego;

00:29:25.692 --> 00:29:31.480
and will put you in confusion.‘ Gadhapanthi pana’,
when compared to ego, is the biggest thing

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:37.400
that is called stupidity. I have seen such arrogant
people and looking at them can’t

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:42.680
Understand weather to laugh that what to do;
Such stupid talk and in arrogance

00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:50.679
they know that we are stupid. Kabir used to
say, 'Education makes scholars fools'.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.580
All those demons were very egoistic. Now in
Kaluga they have worn robes.

00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.160
They do not show arrogance on the surface.
But from within  they are very egoistic and  may

00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:07.293
eat you all up.

00:30:07.327 --> 00:30:12.376
You are similar to newly grown up plant.

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:16.716
Similarly, extremely [‘Navik’-Unclear]

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:22.766
sober is the Nature; If a wind blows
and you get carried away,

00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:29.300
It is not your fault, but one must
keep in that God has given you intelligence,

00:30:29.336 --> 00:30:32.861
you should use it and recognize it that

00:30:32.886 --> 00:30:37.480
what is real and what is imitation.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:41.484
Now  there is Kundalini with in us,
She is awake,

00:30:41.513 --> 00:30:46.275
She only gives you self realization, by which

00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:48.417
You are reborn;

00:30:48.451 --> 00:30:54.790
About which many have
written in all the books that

00:30:54.790 --> 00:31:00.765
Search within yourself, find
within yourself, It's inside yourself.

00:31:00.831 --> 00:31:05.448
But how, this is living process.

00:31:08.896 --> 00:31:14.931
As how does a flower become
a fruit? How does a seed grow?

00:31:14.997 --> 00:31:19.713
How a tree is formed, all are living activities,

00:31:19.730 --> 00:31:23.730
everything is done by God; In the same way

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:31.382
you too attain your self-realization.

00:31:31.416 --> 00:31:34.599
just as a gardener

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:41.780
puts the seed in the mother's womb,
sprouts It putting it in mother’s womb,

00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:46.880
Alike we too do something, that’s all,
more than that we have nothing to do with you,

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:51.763
it's yours own, you take it.

00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:56.396
But how to nurture it, take care
of it, and raise it,

00:31:56.430 --> 00:32:03.470
definitely we do teach you. Now! Venu Gopalan
Saheb said that love the mother;

00:32:03.470 --> 00:32:09.370
If you do it, better; if you don't,
so mother is not going to leave, she

00:32:09.370 --> 00:32:14.542
definitely does love.

00:32:14.559 --> 00:32:19.192
But if you love, you can certainly enjoy it.

00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:23.090
we will love you no matter how much you hit us,
beat, shout, scream, we will definitely

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:30.930
do it because you are our son, but what do
you think about your case, you

00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:38.272
too love yourself, you too should
think about yourself.

00:32:38.290 --> 00:32:39.372
You too know yourself

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:44.887
and immerse in your joy.

00:32:44.887 --> 00:32:47.953
every kind of extreme, that is
there, should be discarded,

00:32:47.987 --> 00:32:54.400
any kind of extreme, that’s there, distracts
you from the middle. Kundalini, there is, its ‘Madhyaga’.

00:32:54.460 --> 00:33:00.960
It has middle path; any extreme
thing, like an extreme- ordinary people,

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:07.558
they understand that if
you become a nun, or a

00:33:07.576 --> 00:33:10.826
monk and going to the forests,

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:18.343
standing on your head, you will get God, will

00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:23.026
never get Him or

00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:28.620
another man, he will think that there is nothing
in it, leave everything and drink alcohol, or think

00:33:28.648 --> 00:33:31.098
do the filth of all kind;

00:33:31.115 --> 00:33:36.981
then such a person is never going to
Get God. Be in

00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:42.353
middle, like an ordinary person.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:46.853
In a marital way,

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:51.607
Using your body in

00:33:51.641 --> 00:33:56.595
a respectful way which is said to be

00:33:56.620 --> 00:34:02.980
Auspicious, should be done; As much It is
Inauspicious, if human lives renouncing it;

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:07.355
His transcending is not at all difficult.

00:34:07.372 --> 00:34:12.305
One thing, there should be inner desire
 and secondly

00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:19.739
He must not go to any extreme.

00:34:19.773 --> 00:34:22.873
If a person goes to any extreme

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:27.530
then you know physically what can
happen from; Now even doctors have

00:34:27.559 --> 00:34:34.651
said that cancer the disease occurs

00:34:34.676 --> 00:34:36.620
because of this that in

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:41.270
some areas in our body

00:34:41.287 --> 00:34:45.820
there are some parts in which

00:34:45.821 --> 00:34:47.768
Protiens

00:34:47.793 --> 00:34:54.080
They named them Protein 58
and it is named like this; Ever since

00:34:54.080 --> 00:34:57.613
the creation, from the time of creation,

00:34:57.647 --> 00:35:02.579
Such proteins in
those parts are

00:35:02.620 --> 00:35:09.253
still live. When these, present,
proteins attack  inside us then, then

00:35:09.287 --> 00:35:11.875
only cancer occurs; whatever
cancer is,

00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:17.400
it errupts, gets triggered; Now even
the doctors have undisputedly said

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:25.240
this and we have been saying here
for ten years that if on the extremes

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:29.280
you tried anything, take it if it is Mesmerism
only, or following of any Guru;

00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:33.040
This you have gone to extremes.

00:35:33.058 --> 00:35:39.024
And you will get an attack of leukemia and

00:35:39.060 --> 00:35:47.060
Cancer; and all sort of diseases,
mostly, are caused by extremes.

00:35:47.077 --> 00:35:48.743
Its  a petty matter

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:53.900
Humans are quite sensitive; people torture him
For some reason or the other;

00:35:53.900 --> 00:36:00.090
If someone is a very decent person then people
give him pain and he continues to bear that pain,

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:07.240
this can also cause illness to him;
What is there to tolerate? If someone

00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:11.560
should say something, you should ask him
to keep quite, there is no need to speak

00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.900
to him, because you yourself are the real
soul, there is no need to tolerate any insulting.

00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:21.900
and also there is no need to insult someone;
is no need to fight with

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:27.700
anyone and no need to take any attack on
one's own. Both things

00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:34.140
will be the same, you stand firmly in the middle
in the middle; Neither  you be

00:36:34.140 --> 00:36:41.320
aggressive on anyone, nor let there
be aggression on you. But the Kundalini Yoga,

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.375
When it occurs then It happens by itself,
nothing needs to be said.

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:50.480
Like I don't ask anyone this that
you don't drink alcohol or  do

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:57.560
nothing because today's Kundalini
Yoga has taken the form of Mahayoga.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:04.028
This is great love and compassion that any
Man of any kind may come,

00:37:04.111 --> 00:37:07.494
transcends; I myself

00:37:07.530 --> 00:37:13.870
get into surprise. People in London,
you see, they drink alcohol, their Ganpati is

00:37:13.870 --> 00:37:20.050
bad, they have no idea
of ​​sex; Nothing, came and got realized.
They got rid off alcohol;

00:37:20.050 --> 00:37:25.390
Their drugs, they got rid off, have become absolutely
beautiful, look at their faces; absolutely sober.

00:37:25.390 --> 00:37:29.550
Because it seemed like where did they come from or
what their condition is, who couldn’t see me.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:33.533
They had come with eyes open under
coma conditions, transcended.

00:37:33.583 --> 00:37:37.233
Cirrhosis liver is cured, leukaemia
is cured, so

00:37:37.270 --> 00:37:43.970
dynamic it is called; intense love, Strong love,

00:37:44.003 --> 00:37:46.203
but to doubt and splint

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:52.080
And, while coming, to think himself great; Sahaja Yoga will
pick you up and throw you away. Such an ocean will pick one after another

00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:59.190
And throw away. Then you will come after months,
this is another thing that you

00:37:59.190 --> 00:38:03.650
Consider yourself very great, the go,
you will be thrown away;I wonder,

00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:07.870
even if I try, that man will not transcend.
He will run away in such a situation

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:13.116
That he will go. There is no place for the ego
in Sahaja Yoga; If you are very learned

00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:17.430
then sit in your home. If You have known
then sit at home,  and if you intend to

00:38:17.430 --> 00:38:24.570
to know then find the soul first.
As for us , we are Mother, now we

00:38:24.570 --> 00:38:30.210
will always remain engaged in service and
will try to impart wisdom within you; You

00:38:30.210 --> 00:38:37.650
love yourself and understand what you
are, that you are the one seeker for eternity. You should

00:38:37.650 --> 00:38:45.180
recognize that category among
your categories what is a my special form.  Just now

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:51.620
Someone gave me a book to read
which William Blake wrote; the title is Milton.

00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:59.320
In which William Blake has symbolized
Milton, the poet, as a seeker.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:05.600
And entire Sahaja Yoga is explained in it and has
Said that this London is

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:12.950
going to be Jerusalem; This is a place.
We have aMuslim disciple,

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:17.610
he lives in Algeria. His mother expressed desire
to visit Macca for Haj, give me money.

00:39:17.610 --> 00:39:23.860
said today's., Mecca which is London, it's London,
go to London; two hundred and fifty Muslims there

00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:30.610
Were given realization.

00:39:30.610 --> 00:39:32.960
Whatever this religious strangulation is there;

00:39:32.993 --> 00:39:37.851
This is not a religion,

00:39:37.876 --> 00:39:43.260
These are in opposition religion, against love,

00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.307
those are standing Demons.

00:39:47.324 --> 00:39:51.635
What we call sinetisysm;  those who
say my religion,

00:39:51.660 --> 00:39:56.000
my religion, ask them what is religion, no one
knows anything. All their walls will

00:39:56.000 --> 00:40:03.620
Collapse, ‘Dhud, Dhud, Dhud’. In Algeria he Told
us that on the day of ‘ Roja’,  fasting everyone
remains hungry

00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:06.900
there and will do all sort of things. What is to be
gained by remaining hungry during ‘Roja’, fasting?

00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:12.620
do all kinds of liquor business Drinking,
all sort of Women's Troubles

00:40:12.620 --> 00:40:19.120
Everything has started there,
just ‘Roza’,fasting will definitely observe.
On the first day of fasting, we laugh or cry,

00:40:19.146 --> 00:40:20.746
we don't understand.

00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:26.030
when they reached the mosque and were about enter.
The entire mosque went inside completely.

00:40:26.063 --> 00:40:27.705
See, how did this mosque go inside?

00:40:27.729 --> 00:40:35.720
Hey, what is a mosque? And what is a temple? Only It is a stone, isn’t it.
The one that doesn’t have God  inside that temple

00:40:35.720 --> 00:40:39.980
And mosque nothing will survive and even that
human being too will not survive whose soul is

00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:46.284
not awakened. Those days are also coming,
therefore awaken your soul.

00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.400
I am your mother, I beg you...

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:55.720
 that identify yourself, understand yourself, don't get
into your ego; attaining awakening of your soul

00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:59.249
Set goal for your ultimate welfare,

00:40:59.282 --> 00:41:03.965
Meditate for the ultimate element. All
useless talk,

00:41:04.020 --> 00:41:10.240
we are this and we are that; We Belong to this
cult, and sect and religion, all this is

00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:15.420
a false, you are only from the
Kingdom of God And these whose

00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:21.530
names you are taking ‘Buddha, Mahavir, etc., Whoever
you name, be it Mohammad Sahib,

00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:27.560
all are our allies, not of these hypocrites;
not of these thieves who in their name

00:41:27.560 --> 00:41:33.800
Establishing big organizations and are making
money; They are with us, they are

00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:39.415
our relatives; So you come to that way,
where these real people are standing.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:44.000
Plucking their flowers, you have
designated yourself and say that we

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:50.200
belong to this religion, we belong to that religion
and Righteousness is as far away from them as

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:55.589
fragrance is from filth. Get your own fragrance,

00:41:55.619 --> 00:41:58.389
go to your own joy; Dive down in your

00:41:58.420 --> 00:42:03.840
sea and all its arrangements are well
built inside you, just let your ego go,

00:42:03.840 --> 00:42:11.040
Lower it a little, a little; There is no need to
fight that too for Kundalini  by itself

00:42:11.040 --> 00:42:16.440
does it. But some preparation is required.
Now I see some scholars,

00:42:16.440 --> 00:42:23.380
educated scholars; books, Just throw
out in the sea, they are completely useless.

00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:28.920
Nothing will happen by reading the
Book; All the ordinary people who live in the rural

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:34.460
there is our real work. In Bombay this
situation exists; Our real work

00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:40.660
is done in the villages; just thousands of people
coming from a village are getting realization here.

00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:47.293
People in cities will be left destitute because
They don't understand themselves, what they

00:42:47.330 --> 00:42:54.290
are. Because gurus are ready for cities
to empty out your pockets. For us, God is in the

00:42:54.290 --> 00:43:01.430
village, in the village itself. You
people should also leave some of your ego

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:08.370
and understand that until we don't find
God then of what good we are? What do we

00:43:08.370 --> 00:43:15.320
Mean. Un necessarily why should understand
something yourself, brother! However, there is one

00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:21.920
thing that should ensure that the ego does not become
strong: You people, who are seekers of God,

00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:29.846
are great saints and there had been prophecy
about It saying that only in the terrible Kaluga,

00:43:29.896 --> 00:43:34.487
this event will happen, Maha Yoga will get
established.

00:43:34.512 --> 00:43:39.100
and Maha Yoga is yours, this is called
Last Judgment, that

00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:45.120
is the awakening of Kundalini that determines
your judgement. And there is no other way

00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:52.624
for it. Today's program though
this is the last one, I am coming again. In Sahaja Yoga

00:43:52.657 --> 00:43:57.974
get well established.

00:43:58.058 --> 00:44:00.357
Only then you get its complete bliss.

00:44:00.391 --> 00:44:05.437
Krishna has also said, “Yoga Kshem Vhamyaham.”
First there will be yoga and then there will be peace.

00:44:05.537 --> 00:44:10.821
There will be no well-being without
yoga. As soon as yoga is established

00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:14.660
The concept of well-being also
changes and also well-being occurs,

00:44:14.693 --> 00:44:18.693
first  you attain your yoga, well-being will
automatically occur.

00:44:18.710 --> 00:44:23.093
There are many people here who will tell how
happiness got achieved from Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:23.120 --> 00:44:30.040
Everyone benefits and you will also
benefit; This God has opened his own

00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:35.874
door for you. Will he not give
you these petty things?

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:42.780
But all your priorities, that is called, all-together
valuations change and you become other

00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:48.760
person; you become that person,
settle in that and enjoy and in this Bombay

00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:56.440
do some special work, that's what I desire.
There are centres at every place in Bombay.

00:44:56.440 --> 00:45:00.760
and also they run a center in
Bharati Vidya Bhawan.

00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:05.393
who do not find easy here
come here but you will have to come,

00:45:05.393 --> 00:45:09.926
collectivism is its essence [end - unclear].

00:45:09.960 --> 00:45:14.193
Sahaja Yoga means collectivism,

00:45:14.218 --> 00:45:19.426
Awakening of collectivism is the main
characteristic of Sahaja yoga.

00:45:19.460 --> 00:45:24.760
There is community within you,
You can find on your fingers that

00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:30.720
How your Chakra is behaving and where is
catch on other’s Chakra. You become collective.

00:45:30.720 --> 00:45:38.303
Not through lectures, 'You are brothers and
sisters', not this 'You become, become',

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:40.055
you feel yourself,

00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:46.880
you feel others within you.
This is a part of the ‘Virat’

00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:52.000
And in your being you get awakened.
 And you start feeling it inside.

00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:59.380
Within it has to happen. Until or unless
this incident doesn’t happens, just by giving lectures

00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:02.900
You can not be  anyone's brother or sister.
You may not have that feel.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:07.640
this is an event, it has to
happen. And this is not for frivolous people.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:12.940
Again I am saying, people who
are frivolous, those who just went to four

00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.440
Places, now there is time in the lecture,
listened to mother also and then they left.

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:21.840
This is no shop and no market, one has to
settle down in it and only the one who settles

00:46:21.865 --> 00:46:24.091
He only will achieve it completely.

00:46:24.092 --> 00:46:29.375
May God keep you happy!

00:46:29.413 --> 00:46:32.112
If you have one or two
questions then ask,

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:38.510
no harm, but useless nonsense
questions If you ask, I am very smart.

00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:56.639
Second question is good!

00:47:56.680 --> 00:48:08.260
What are the symptoms, how recognize
whether awakening occurred or not?

00:48:08.260 --> 00:48:15.000
The symptom is such that when Kundalini is
Awakened, so in accordance with your middle path

00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.960
your symptoms will be visible in the beginning; For
example, if someone's navel chakra is caught, means

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:24.400
that the real thing must be seen.
Not that whatever we say

00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:32.393
that will happen only; if you
have catch on your navel chakra,
understand that neither your Kundalini will

00:48:32.426 --> 00:48:37.320
remain vibrating in the triangular bone only,
won't rise for a long long time but will vibrate.

00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:44.620
You can see with your eyes. If your navel chakra etc. are
in order, Okay, you are a man of the middle path,

00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:52.660
some Guru has still not blessed you; mean
you haven’t received any blessings, Kundalini

00:48:52.660 --> 00:48:57.880
can rise spontaneously, if you are
very rationalistic and think a lot

00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:02.764
 On Agnya Chakra,

00:49:02.798 --> 00:49:10.056
On stopping on Agnya your eyes may,
will get dilated.

00:49:10.081 --> 00:49:15.480
your eyes will dilate, so you are asked to close your
eyes; In mesmerism ‘keep eyes open’,

00:49:15.480 --> 00:49:21.016
it is asked. Sit with your eyes closed.

00:49:21.016 --> 00:49:28.732
If your Sahastrar is much better, then

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:32.590
Spontaneously you start getting cold air
from here will, you will feel as if a cooler is put on,

00:49:32.590 --> 00:49:38.550
coolness will start flowing from inside you,
If there is something in your body

00:49:38.550 --> 00:49:42.270
like liver, that is, it is called liver.
If it is bad or something, then from your within

00:49:42.270 --> 00:49:45.850
hot air will start coming. If there is some illness
first hot air will start to come

00:49:45.850 --> 00:49:49.161
from your within here,

00:49:49.178 --> 00:49:54.735
then by and by it will cool down and many

00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:59.080
people will already be able to
feel the cool air in their hand. This is the best

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:06.320
symptom that cold breeze has started blowing on
your hand. When I sat down, it

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.540
will come from my side, else it will
 flow like this; This cool breeze is only the wave of

00:50:11.540 --> 00:50:17.440
Consciousness, which is very clearly called
The Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost in the Bible

00:50:17.440 --> 00:50:21.490
Holy Ghost mean Adishakti.

00:50:21.507 --> 00:50:27.025
You will start feeling that and instantly
thoughtless will occur.

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:32.850
With the crossing over the Agnya Chakra the
thoughtlessness establishes and on piercing the ‘Brahamrandra’

00:50:32.850 --> 00:50:38.615
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is in order,
it starts flowing profusely in your hand,

00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:42.710
but due to anomaly in Vishuddhi sometimes it
happens that you don’t feel so much on the fingers

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:46.750
but it will start happening here.
And you will also know that Kundalini is

00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:50.850
rising. As Venu Gopalan's Vishuddhi is bad, he too,
poor fellow has been

00:50:50.850 --> 00:50:55.290
after many gurus. Earlier he did
not feel it on hand but

00:50:55.290 --> 00:51:00.830
felt the movement of
Kundalini inside. Its light was also visible to him

00:51:00.830 --> 00:51:07.519
With practicing now he can now feel it on hand too.

00:51:07.536 --> 00:51:09.877
So its biggest symptom is

00:51:09.902 --> 00:51:13.485
that the person becomes completely relaxed

00:51:13.519 --> 00:51:18.285
and the witness nature starts coming and

00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:25.180
Cold waves start flowing from the hand; This is a
sign of awakening. Now when this situation

00:51:25.180 --> 00:51:32.820
arises, you should put it to use. Needed Now if
you become a king and you do

00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:38.760
not establish any right of your kingship, then
who will believe that you area king; then you

00:51:38.760 --> 00:51:43.920
should see others, you should see raising
their Kundalini;

00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:51.403
see the vibrations of others, then you will be
surprised that what power you have within.

00:51:51.428 --> 00:51:53.086
Then the complete

00:51:53.120 --> 00:52:00.995
knowledge will be Imparted. And You can
test and see whether it is true or not.

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.253
But do not be
suspicious, look it humbly, Yes brother!

00:52:05.295 --> 00:52:09.220
Like in the beginning in London there was a

00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:15.280
gentleman, transcended him; He said
Mother! will we be able to find out
everything from here, I said

00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:20.760
yes, why not? Said ‘Haven't received
a call from father for a long time, lives in Scotland.’

00:52:20.794 --> 00:52:26.335
I said ok! with both hands like this Keep
In his name, immediately he got a catch here.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:33.268
Burning set in and started saying, 'What is
this?' I said all this for Father,

00:52:33.293 --> 00:52:38.835
And this depicts Vishuddhi Chakra. 'Hee Mast Be
Down with bronchitis ,'I said these words '' in English.

00:52:38.860 --> 00:52:45.019
He must be down with bronchitis. He called
her father, his mother came on phone, asked how are you,

00:52:45.052 --> 00:52:50.536
how is father, she said, 'Father is badly down
With bronchitis', these were the words he said.

00:52:50.553 --> 00:52:54.202
Later he also thought that maybe
Mother has known this from her inner

00:52:54.227 --> 00:53:00.569
powers, but not from my strength, I said ok!
not in front of me, try otherwise, then became indisputable

00:53:00.602 --> 00:53:08.320
Because your connection with God
Gets established. On your hand, everything,

00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:13.460
you can know.

00:53:13.460 --> 00:53:17.035
your fingertips till now. So far there is no
such thing like an absolute knowledge.

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:20.440
So you know, this man is true or false;
This Guru is true or false,

00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:26.160
how to know. Keeping hands towards him,
thinking about him

00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:31.626
you will know How the man is?

00:53:31.660 --> 00:53:33.076
One gets knowledge of Brahma.

00:53:33.110 --> 00:53:39.160
It is This Brahma which is ‘Vairagya’
asceticism.

00:53:39.193 --> 00:53:41.743
therefore without
using it, without using it,

00:53:41.770 --> 00:53:47.510
you cannot understand what you are?
What is your condition; So first

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:53.590
told you the symptoms and
then It was told how you consider

00:53:53.590 --> 00:53:59.710
it inside you as if it is a medicine,
when you take it, it benefits you.

00:53:59.710 --> 00:54:03.770
That's why you don't believe that this medicine
is good. If it is said by some Doctor you are not going to

00:54:03.770 --> 00:54:09.970
believe, similarly you yourself start
giving its certificate. Now, all these

00:54:09.970 --> 00:54:16.090
people who are sitting here know Sahaja Yoga,
Learn Sahaja Yoga from them; Younger than them

00:54:16.131 --> 00:54:18.856
Our  grand daughter who is just
four years of age you can learn from her too.

00:54:18.881 --> 00:54:23.464
[Marathi- Achha ekaraan ki vichaaya hai hai
