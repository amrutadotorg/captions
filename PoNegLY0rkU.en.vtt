00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:03.960
Journalist: As you did so we can just get the...

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.880
We got the camera here, you see..

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:08.360
This is what people have to do?
Shri Mataji: Yes, just that's all.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.080
Journalist: Hold their hand there, mother.
Shri Mataji: Up to their both feet like this.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.480
Journalist: And feet like that, hold out their hands..

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.960
That's the way to do it.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it might work out.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.360
Journalist: All right.. We're just getting the shots, you see.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.600
All right, but you spread fingers, or fingers together?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.960
Shri Mataji: Just like...relaxed.. as if asking for something.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.400
Journalist: Yes.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.920
?: Raise your hand ?
Journalist: Yes, we are just getting there..

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.200
Shri Mataji: You yourself will start feeling it.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.920
You are shaking a little. That means you work very hard.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.520
Journalist: Yes, too hard.

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.120
Shri Mataji: On your nerves. Now they'll soothe down.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.960
See, that shake is coming from too much strain on the nerves.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.440
Specially the right side is shaking.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.320
Journalist: Coming from the left side of the brain.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.600
Shri Mataji: You have to forgive, you have to forgive,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.560
forgive, forgive everyone.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.680
Just forgive, just forgive, it will work out.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.520
You feel ?

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.840
Still shaking. This shaking has to go, then it will work out.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.880
I'm giving you balance, raising your left side, the emotional side,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.160
the right side of your action, you see being fulfilled.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.640
Can I touch your forhead?

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.240
Close your eyes.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.200
Are you feeling peaceful now?

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.640
Journalist: Hm..are my hands stopped shaking?

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.480
Shri Mataji: Yes, it has, little bit still, it stopped.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:21.160
This hand up, so it will cool down.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.640
Better now.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.640
We overdo things sometimes, isn't it, which we should not.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.800
Now better, see, it's better, it stopped.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.600
Journalist: And how long do I need to sit here like this?

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.880
Shri Mataji: Just to assure... are you feeling the cool breeze in the hand?

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.720
Are you feeling anything cool?

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.200
Journalist: I feel relaxed, calm.

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:11.840
Shri Mataji: Relaxed. No cool in the hand?

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.800
And see, you can see pulsation is here, now,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.920
in the center of your head. It just breaks here.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.920
It takes hardly any time.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.120
Still you are shaking, you see.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.240
All right, just say, "Mother, give me my realization".

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.040
Journalist: Give me my realization..

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.760
Shri Mataji: Again..
Journalist: Give me my realization..

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.800
Shri Mataji: Once more, once more.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.960
Journalist: Give me my realization, give me my realization.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.640
Give me my realization..

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.000
Shri Mataji: Better..

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.800
Journalist: Give me my realization..

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.400
Shri Mataji: Are you feeling the relaxation? Light,

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.840
you feel light within yourself, feel lighter?

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.840
Shri Mataji: Hands will clear. You have to forgive, it's too much work.

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.440
How many years you have worked like this?

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.000
Days in and days out, worrying, for what?

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:29.560
Everything is done by God. He does all the work, now seems better.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.240
Are you feeling cool?

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.600
Journalist: Ah, I feel a tingling in my hand.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.360
Shri Mataji: Tingling is not a perfekt sign, but it means it has started.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.360
It is smoothy all right, this is all right. Is it all right?

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:47.200
This one is all right, this is still tingling.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.480
But it stopped shaking now.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:59.480
Better? Better now? All right? It works.. it works.. it works.

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.520
Now you can't think, just watch me. You can't think.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.480
Journalist: Oh, I can think.
Shri Mataji: About thinking, when you want you can think.

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.960
Journalist: Oh, yes.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.360
Shri Mataji: But now you can be beyond thinking also.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:19.400
Journalist: Oh really? What...?
Shri Mataji: So that's it. So no worries.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.360
All right ? Journalist: Now, all right.
Shri Mataji: Feeling the cool?

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.600
Journalist: Let's do the interview and then see if I relax afterwards..

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.720
Shri Mataji: Oh yes, yes. You will. You will relax much more.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:37.560
Journalist: Whenever you like Chris.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.160
All right.

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.440
Mother, this is for people watching now.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.040
What can it be in this for them?
Shri Mataji: What is?...

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.640
Journalist: So what have you to say to the people

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.520
who are watching this on television at the moment?

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.040
Shri Mataji: Those who are watching at this time,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:12.080
they have to just spread their hands like this towards the

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:17.360
television set and see if they feel any cool breeze in their hands.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.360
If they feel it, they should know that this is

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.280
the power of God's love,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.760
is the all pervading Power about which everybody has talked.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.240
The time has come for all of us to achieve it.

00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:32.680
This is the epitome of our evolution

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.080
by which we find out ourselves, our absolute,

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.680
our meaning, our purpose of life.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.400
The first time you feel the all pervading Power,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:46.160
which is doing all sorts of living work,

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:49.760
like transforming a flower into a fruit.

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.280
All this is done by God. What we do is the dead work.

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.440
Is transforming dead to the dead.

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.080
But God does all the living work,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.480
and first time you start feeling this power,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.720
and then you have to learn how to use it

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.240
for doing living work on this earth.

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:07.240
Journalist: And the people who extend their hands towards You now

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.360
on the television set, can they expect Self-realization?

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.760
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course.
Journalist: And from that, is a by-product health?

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:17.640
Shri Mataji: Yes, health, of course. They can...
Journalist: Healing?

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:21.320
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. But they have to see which hand is heavier,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:23.080
which hand is not heavier.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:26.640
They might get, all of them, spontaneously realization,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:30.280
but they have to come to Me to know how to maintain it,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:33.200
how to understand it, how to give it to others.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:36.040
Because God is only interested in those people

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.360
who are going to work as lights.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.880
And we do not keep enlightened lights under the table.

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:45.680
So such people will get their realization very fast

00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:47.600
if they desire it.

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:49.480
Desire is very important.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.360
Journalist: So there are some people watching at this very moment

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.280
who are receiving that.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:57.720
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course. It's all over, it's all pervading.

00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:59.320
It's like your ether,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.240
through which they are seeing the television now.

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.720
In the same way God's power is everywhere. You can feel it.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:10.560
Journalist: And it doesn't have to be that these people will be with You.

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:12.440
They can do this by extending their hands

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:14.280
towards the television set or the photograph.

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.640
Shri Mataji: Yes, My photograph is there. That's sufficient to work it out.

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.360
That's sufficient to work it out.

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.760
But they have to come to Me to decode it, what it is,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.880
how to feel it, what's the problem is.

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.840
Because at the very first outset, I've seen, it rushes out

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.840
and the whole thing you can feel very fast.

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:34.240
But then it goes back to the problems that you have.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.960
So it is better to see that you learn all about it.

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.600
And you don't have to pay anything,

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:41.280
nothing of the kind. It's very easy.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.080
It's nothing difficult or complicated.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.600
Journalist: All right. Thank you very much. I was happy with that.

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.160
And how we are doing? We got enough? Or I should...

00:08:52.360 --> 00:08:54.080
Do one more shot.

00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:57.520
There will be one more shot and then we...

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.720
Shri Mataji: One minute. It was probably more than that.

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:04.520
Journalist: Yes, it was a bit more.. or later.

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:09.640
Now we better check my hands. So they are both back shaking again.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:14.200
Shri Mataji: Still shaking? See what you are doing to yourself.

00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:17.120
You must learn to relax.
Journalist: Working too much.

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:20.640
Shri Mataji: Yes, too much, working too hard, you can see, clearly you see.

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:24.640
Why should they shake? You are a young man, I'm an old woman.

00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.720
Journalist: Yes.

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.040
Shri Mataji: See even now how much they are shaking. Just see.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.080
This is not good.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.800
Journalist: I best learn to relax a little.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.920
Shri Mataji: Now you have to use My photograph. That's the best way to relax.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.960
Put My photograph in front, put a light before it,

00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.440
put your hands towards the photograph..

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.240
put both your feet in the water and little salt.

00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:54.280
The whole thing will go in the water,you'll flush it out that water.

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.720
You find everything is all right. He's got it, I think.

00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:02.120
On the top of his head, he's got it, but his hand are vague.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:04.880
Firstly, you have to talk to all kinds of people also, you see.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.720
You catch from them as well..

00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.600
Do you smoke?
Journalist: No.

00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:17.640
Shri Mataji: Then it should not happen. That's only nervousness.

00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:22.960
Better, you are feeling it. Good.

00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.640
Journalist: Yes.
Shri Mataji: Yes, it's there.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:25.920
Journalist: But I mean...

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.560
Shri Mataji: It's there. Little balance I am giving you.

00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:34.240
Too much working with your brain and very futuristic,

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:39.280
and a speedy person. All right? Now, better.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:43.600
Journalist: Yeah. Well, thank you very much for talking with me.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:46.720
I hope you enjoyed it.
Shri Mataji: I hope you'll communicate to the people.

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.720
Let the Australians get this. This is their right to have it.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:52.360
Sahaja Yogi: Let them know that She is appearing tonight and tomorrow night.

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:55.400
Journalist: Yes, I have the details for.. there..
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you..

00:10:55.600 --> 00:10:57.520
Journalist: All right. Thank you very much.
