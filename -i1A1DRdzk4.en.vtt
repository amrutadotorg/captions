[Music]

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:39.800
I'd belong to a family of very

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.800
enlightened people my father was a

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:48.239
linguist and he was mastered of 14

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:53.010
languages he knew about 26 languages and

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:59.489
he translated even karana sharif into

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:05.489
Hindi language my mother was in those

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:09.180
days was honours in mathematics so both

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:19.920
were very well educated and enlightened

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:24.600
people at the time of my birth my mother

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:27.509
dreamt something which she could not

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.380
explain but after that she had a great

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:35.240
desire to go and see a tiger in the open

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.459
field my father was a great hunter

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.979
because Tigers were the meanest in the

00:01:38.459 --> 00:01:43.520
area where we were living it was a hill

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.929
station called Xinhua

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.470
so there was a king who was very much

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:52.649
interested in my father somehow other a

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.259
letter came that there's a tiger very

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.880
big tiger that has appeared and they're

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.789
frightened of him that he might be a

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.899
maneater

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:07.800
so my father took my mother and me to

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.840
that place and they were sitting what we

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:13.950
call as a mechon where they bid

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:19.459
something for people to sit on top of a

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:22.380
tree from where they can shoot nicely

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:26.310
and then my mother tells me that a big

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:30.060
huge tiger of a very big size very

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.959
beautifully appeared on the field and

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:40.129
she felt tremendous love for the tiger

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:40.129
it was a full moon day and she felt

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.900
extremely compassionate towards the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:48.510
tiger and when my father raised his gun

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.170
to shoot she stopped and she wouldn't

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:56.130
allow when the Tiger went away and he

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:59.250
never came to that forest again but that

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.040
made my father think because he himself

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:07.530
was a realized soul that must be

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:12.150
somebody what we call a goddess durga

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:15.989
who is fond of the tiger must be bought

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.630
on to my mother because the symptoms

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.930
were rather funny that lady should like

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:24.000
to see a tiger ever so he told my mother

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.410
now are you satisfied because they were

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.019
struggling with the gun he said he's

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.769
there and Durga sitting in your womb

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.959
that you are trying to protect the tiger

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.050
she said yes yes so stop it now I won't

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:39.720
allow me like that there were many

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:43.650
incidents in my life because I am off a

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.810
Christian family brought distance and

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.910
when I was born my mother didn't feel

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.450
any labor pains or anything and just I

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.549
was born she didn't know how and I had

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:56.010
no blood on my body nothing I was clean

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.180
washed that's why they called me I knew

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:02.280
as their mana but my grandmother said

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:05.549
that she should be called as Nishka

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.730
lanka that means the one which has no

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:09.840
spots on it but that's the name of math

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:14.760
so they said all right we'll call her

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.650
Nirmala meaning the same immaculate now

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:20.190
all these incidents and then my father

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.610
being a realized soul he felt tremendous

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:29.280
vibrations from me and he felt that this

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:33.090
life is great and she do something

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.039
reaching this life I do not know why but

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.520
I don't know if he dreamt or he

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:40.470
understood it but all the time if I

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.190
remember when he talked to me he used to

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.000
say that you have to find out a way of

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:50.370
giving a masse realization all the time

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.650
as I told he was a great scholar of so

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:56.790
many things and very

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:59.520
widely that man so he gave me a good

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.720
education in religion

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.460
in different religions and also good

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:08.280
education about human beings what are

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.919
their problems why did he act like this

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:13.410
why don't they take to God why are the

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.080
hypocritical all kinds of things he

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:19.740
talked to me he also knew about

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:24.090
Kundalini but not so much of course when

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:27.150
I was born I knew about Kundalini myself

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:29.190
I knew all about it from my very

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.220
childhood it was very aware person

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:34.110
extremely aware I didn't know how to

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.150
talk to because see people didn't have

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:39.300
that awareness you can't talk to

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.280
everyone like that so I was regarded as

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.840
a very jolly person at the same time

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:49.320
very serious also very deep and then I

00:05:45.840 --> 00:06:01.670
started my studies as a child

00:05:49.320 --> 00:06:05.000
[Music]

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:08.270
I was not very much interested in the

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:10.700
study's bias to do very well but I used

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.450
to read lives of great men and things

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:17.560
like that at a very young age I were not

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.550
shocked when people were reading justly

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.220
expectations I was reading but not

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:24.800
shocked but as such I didn't have

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.210
interest in particularly reading some

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.130
textbooks because I thought they were

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:32.030
childish and when there's nothing to

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.890
read about it then I told my father that

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.830
I have to do medicine so he said why I

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:38.210
said because I have to talk to doctors

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:41.840
he said you have to talk to doctor us

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:43.490
yes I said but it so happen in my

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:47.660
childhood when I was about 7 years of

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:49.040
age my father was a congressman he had

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.160
joined Congress when I was four years

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:54.140
old he is totally with the style with

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.480
the westernized his clothes west East

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:58.610
England and sort of a man we had

00:06:56.480 --> 00:07:02.810
governesses in order you threw away

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:08.720
everything maybe real Indian and started

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:12.950
leading a life of Amartya then he made a

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:15.740
study our language is Sanskrit he made

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.540
me study in an Indian school not in a

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:20.060
missionary school because missionaries

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.680
were very unkind they threw us out of

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:24.820
the school when my father was in the

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:27.700
Congress they were against us completely

00:07:24.820 --> 00:07:32.510
then at the age of seven years I

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:36.440
happened to go with my father to heart

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:38.060
ma Gandhi he was about 72 mice living

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:40.490
with us but the first time he took me

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:43.490
down and madman and he liked me very

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:45.260
much he said leave this child with me so

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:47.900
I had not been taken clothes or anything

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:52.850
I stayed on when my father sent me

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:55.310
everything with him and it was very fond

00:07:52.850 --> 00:07:56.600
of me but I was a little girl but she

00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:59.860
understood that there was something

00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:03.680
about me he consulted me on very serious

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:07.370
problems sometimes surprisingly like one

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:09.710
day he wanted to make the prayer book

00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:12.800
all right so he asked me how should I

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:14.020
put the series and all that so I told me

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.419
how to

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:20.500
series and he put the series in that way

00:08:16.419 --> 00:08:23.470
I used to go back for my spoon and again

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:27.039
go back to manager every year like that

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:27.819
and he called me Nepali give me a name

00:08:27.039 --> 00:08:29.800
Nepali

00:08:27.819 --> 00:08:35.110
everybody used to call me Nepali that

00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:37.570
time then I grew up with him very

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:39.399
intimately it was a very very kind

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:41.860
person for children otherwise an

00:08:39.399 --> 00:08:43.870
extremely strict man with himself and

00:08:41.860 --> 00:08:47.709
with others very strict a big

00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:49.540
disciplinarian and he would make

00:08:47.709 --> 00:08:51.360
everybody get up at 4 o clock have your

00:08:49.540 --> 00:08:54.279
baths everything be ready for your

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.140
morning prayers at 5 o clock you see and

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:58.329
used to walk very fast I also learnt

00:08:56.140 --> 00:09:02.079
walking fast with him in his company had

00:08:58.329 --> 00:09:04.839
to walk fast and with extremely loving

00:09:02.079 --> 00:09:06.850
and a very nice person and he would

00:09:04.839 --> 00:09:08.260
listen to me because I was a child

00:09:06.850 --> 00:09:10.329
you see supposing I forced him to eat

00:09:08.260 --> 00:09:14.680
more or something than he would in love

00:09:10.329 --> 00:09:16.329
he would accept very kindly person but

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:17.890
with others was very strict and I used

00:09:16.329 --> 00:09:21.490
to tell him that why you restrict with

00:09:17.890 --> 00:09:23.290
him to burn he said but you are a little

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:24.700
girl you get up in the morning time why

00:09:23.290 --> 00:09:26.709
can't I get up I said I am literally

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:28.240
that's why I get up that big so they

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:32.589
can't get up like that I see little

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:34.540
chats and then my father went to jail

00:09:32.589 --> 00:09:37.690
and my mother also went to jail five

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:39.310
times my father went to jail twice once

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:41.410
for about two and a half years and he

00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:44.680
was the only supporting member of the

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:47.860
family by the way we come from a very

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:50.620
old royal family which is called a

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:55.390
shalivahanas they have a calendar also

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:59.350
in India and then when we I mean when

00:09:55.390 --> 00:10:01.570
they took my father to jail we had to

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:04.690
leave our house and to live in hearts

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:07.270
and in all problems that was nothing but

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.730
also me they've tested a lot because I

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:11.560
helped many people there and I joined

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.510
the 42 movement in a very serious way

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:14.950
and I became the leader here for the

00:10:13.510 --> 00:10:18.459
young people I thought unless and until

00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:21.420
I take a very positive stand it may not

00:10:18.459 --> 00:10:21.420
work out with them

00:10:22.230 --> 00:10:27.240
it's not vicious to say how are they

00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:29.040
tortured me what they did to me but they

00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:32.610
really tortured me I was a young girl of

00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:36.839
nineteen years that time it's over now

00:10:32.610 --> 00:10:39.240
so it's finished and after that we my

00:10:36.839 --> 00:10:42.570
father went to really again and then

00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:45.660
when he came back he got elected as the

00:10:42.570 --> 00:10:48.510
member of the central Assembly later on

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:49.470
as the Constituent Assembly and then at

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:51.690
the Parliament

00:10:49.470 --> 00:10:55.380
my brother was also a member of the

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:59.519
Parliament later on now recently he was

00:10:55.380 --> 00:11:03.140
the minister in the cabinet another

00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:05.730
brother is a High Court judge in Bombay

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:08.910
they are all being well despite the fact

00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:10.649
that our parents and neglected us in a

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:13.560
way because they gave their lives of the

00:11:10.649 --> 00:11:16.399
country but you see that never debtor as

00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:19.980
from studies and we came up very well

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:22.410
then I when I was in 42 whom went to see

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:24.810
my college desta gated me from the

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:28.050
college they threw me out and I had to

00:11:24.810 --> 00:11:29.370
go to another college to study far away

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:34.199
from my house

00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:38.779
he went out but I studied for two years

00:11:34.199 --> 00:11:42.360
science I did then I did my medical I

00:11:38.779 --> 00:11:45.209
didn't do fully because just after that

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:46.920
the 47 riots broke out so College was

00:11:45.209 --> 00:11:48.870
closed and I didn't want to know more

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:51.990
because what I wanted to know I came to

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:55.260
know about it so I did not need and I

00:11:51.990 --> 00:11:57.420
got married you must have heard my

00:11:55.260 --> 00:11:58.769
husband was is now the secretary-general

00:11:57.420 --> 00:12:01.350
of the International Maritime

00:11:58.769 --> 00:12:05.550
Organization he held a very high

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:07.440
positions he was also secretary to Al

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:09.449
Bahadur Shastri who was our prime

00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:11.610
minister who was another very great man

00:12:09.449 --> 00:12:13.709
but he did not survive long if you had

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:15.390
survived things would have been

00:12:13.709 --> 00:12:18.060
different I think for our country

00:12:15.390 --> 00:12:21.089
because he was a Gandhian out-and-out

00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:23.560
panthéon and he lived like it ideal

00:12:21.089 --> 00:12:36.580
mantheon personality

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:42.080
[Music]

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:46.339
so that's how life went on but inner

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:49.270
being was still seeking the way and

00:12:46.339 --> 00:12:52.940
methods of giving amass realization

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:56.540
my father said before you do not develop

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.790
this technique of giving a mass

00:12:56.540 --> 00:13:00.440
sterilization don't talk of religion let

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:01.010
nobody know that you know anything about

00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:04.339
it

00:13:01.010 --> 00:13:06.140
because they'll crucify you or he was

00:13:04.339 --> 00:13:07.700
rather worried that people won't

00:13:06.140 --> 00:13:10.580
understand or you may write another

00:13:07.700 --> 00:13:13.370
Bible or Gita no use first of all you

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.839
must give them realization if they get

00:13:13.370 --> 00:13:18.710
their realization then they will realize

00:13:14.839 --> 00:13:21.440
that there's something about about this

00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:23.870
human awareness for example he always

00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.120
used to give an analogy supposing you

00:13:23.870 --> 00:13:28.310
are born on the 10th story and

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:30.529
everybody's on the ground you must at

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.000
least make them climb two stories so

00:13:30.529 --> 00:13:35.120
they know there's something about it

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:38.240
otherwise no use talking about it and he

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:40.820
said this is the mistake between the

00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:42.260
Saints and the incarnations was that

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:44.540
they never realized that these people

00:13:42.260 --> 00:13:49.190
are still on the ground they have to

00:13:44.540 --> 00:13:50.779
still enter into the reading so that is

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:52.940
what you have to be very careful that

00:13:50.779 --> 00:13:53.860
first of all you must give realization

00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:57.709
to me

00:13:53.860 --> 00:14:00.830
so I was seeking the ways and methods

00:13:57.709 --> 00:14:03.320
working it out inside myself through my

00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:05.209
own style of meditation in the sense

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.070
that I would work out all the

00:14:05.209 --> 00:14:09.920
permutations and combinations supposing

00:14:07.070 --> 00:14:12.200
I met one person then I would see what

00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:15.200
problems that person had how you can

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:19.520
overcome it like that I would try to

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:21.920
study that person internally and I went

00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:24.860
to many people find out but I found

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.110
everybody booklets I saw so many of

00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:29.140
these gurus most of them I saw them I

00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:33.770
was surprised they were all hypocrites

00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:36.680
money making and staying and also I went

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:40.640
to Rajneesh also to see him then he said

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:41.959
that I should come to his table I didn't

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:43.700
know what sort of a man because he was

00:14:41.959 --> 00:14:44.930
talking about eat and even things I

00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:48.290
thought you might be knowing something

00:14:44.930 --> 00:14:49.760
about it went that but my husband said

00:14:48.290 --> 00:14:52.220
no I won't allow to go to

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:53.930
so he arranged his own mother no and all

00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:56.120
that for me so I went down there and

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.250
there I couldn't see all the things that

00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.980
were going on and that is the day

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:03.170
somehow or other I said I must open the

00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:07.790
last chakra so the last chakra was open

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:10.190
and I saw the Kundalini which is the

00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:13.820
primordial force within us which is the

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:19.190
Holy Ghost within us rising like a

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:23.240
telescope opening out and then I saw the

00:15:19.190 --> 00:15:26.750
whole thing open and a big torrential

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:30.170
rain of grease started flowing through

00:15:26.750 --> 00:15:32.180
my head all over as if and I felt I'm

00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:35.000
lost now I have no more there it's only

00:15:32.180 --> 00:15:36.860
that place is that the that is there I

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:43.070
saw it completely happening to me

00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:44.990
and but I was amazed that when I went to

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:46.279
the Janine's you see because before

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:47.660
going out to say goodbye he never

00:15:46.279 --> 00:15:50.870
realized what had happened or anything

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:53.899
else so I was surprised I said this man

00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:55.130
doesn't know anything about God and then

00:15:53.899 --> 00:16:00.829
I discovered that they were all

00:15:55.130 --> 00:16:05.089
hypocrites and telling lies so in 1973

00:16:00.829 --> 00:16:09.110
this happened on 5th of May 17 1970

00:16:05.089 --> 00:16:11.329
fifth of May and just after that I we

00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:13.399
had a very big lecture in Jahangir all

00:16:11.329 --> 00:16:14.720
this already be gone and thousands of

00:16:13.399 --> 00:16:17.180
people had to come I told them very

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:18.769
frankly that these are all thugs and

00:16:17.180 --> 00:16:21.319
these are like this appropriate some of

00:16:18.769 --> 00:16:23.300
them are demonic some are evil people I

00:16:21.319 --> 00:16:25.279
took their names everything I told them

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.670
don't go near them there were some

00:16:25.279 --> 00:16:30.740
foreigners also and there were so many

00:16:28.670 --> 00:16:33.050
others whom I told these things very

00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:34.430
clearly and they got frightened they

00:16:33.050 --> 00:16:35.990
said you shouldn't say like this they

00:16:34.430 --> 00:16:38.180
will come and murder you they will do I

00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:40.279
said let them come and murder me but

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:44.600
nobody does anything nobody even went to

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:47.690
the courts and that's how you see they

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.699
tried to bring bad name to me they paid

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:51.889
money to the newspapers to publish

00:16:49.699 --> 00:16:54.230
things against me because I said you

00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:58.519
cannot pay money so they thought that I

00:16:54.230 --> 00:17:00.290
was just trying to see harm them by

00:16:58.519 --> 00:17:02.660
saying such a thing that you can't earn

00:17:00.290 --> 00:17:03.270
money in the name of war if it's a job

00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:08.420
you can

00:17:03.270 --> 00:17:11.940
but God's work is not a job and the

00:17:08.420 --> 00:17:15.270
struggle started from the day I started

00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:17.910
giving realization and I started with

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:21.150
one lady know what realization first

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:24.390
then we got about 12 people who got

00:17:21.150 --> 00:17:29.130
realization in two years I got only

00:17:24.390 --> 00:17:31.440
about 14 people realization then

00:17:29.130 --> 00:17:33.120
gradually went 14 people got realization

00:17:31.440 --> 00:17:36.570
then many others started getting

00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.440
realization but I started also curing

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:44.100
people because that was helping a lot

00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:46.370
then my house my husband got elected to

00:17:44.100 --> 00:17:49.260
this post and we had to come to London

00:17:46.370 --> 00:17:51.210
so when I came to London we had one

00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:54.000
program in party with everyone they

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.250
arranged it so the Indians abroad are

00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:58.680
not so much interested in God they were

00:17:56.250 --> 00:18:01.130
more interested in money so now the

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:05.280
Indian stayed there they all ran away

00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:08.370
and only the foreigners who were there

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:10.080
when about seven hippies so I had to

00:18:08.370 --> 00:18:15.030
work on them seven hippies for four

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:17.970
years I was working difficult to see the

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:20.850
earlier was back that inhale the head

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:23.670
was all terrible times but in between

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:25.110
eyes to go to India and in India also

00:18:23.670 --> 00:18:27.630
the work was done for three months

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.180
always I would be in India so we started

00:18:27.630 --> 00:18:32.100
working in the villages especially

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:33.960
surprisingly where my forefathers were

00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:36.780
ruling in that area the were started

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:39.090
moving in a very big way and there then

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:42.690
we started taking some people from India

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:46.200
then some people came from Australia to

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:49.950
India like that and the work started

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:52.740
moving in those direction now gradually

00:18:49.950 --> 00:18:54.720
the work improved and people found that

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:57.510
this is the way we can transform

00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:01.440
ourselves many people were taking drugs

00:18:57.510 --> 00:19:02.880
or alcohol or mad people answered people

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:05.070
they felt better

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:06.780
then they got cured and it was

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:12.360
established that sahaja yoga is

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:15.180
something really important now when I

00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:17.159
travel all over the world you see first

00:19:15.180 --> 00:19:20.639
of my husband used to pay for every

00:19:17.159 --> 00:19:22.470
thing whenever I went she had to pay any

00:19:20.639 --> 00:19:25.169
expenses he is to do for me

00:19:22.470 --> 00:19:27.869
gradually then now these people pay for

00:19:25.169 --> 00:19:30.899
my travel but otherwise they don't have

00:19:27.869 --> 00:19:33.539
to pay for anything else that's how we

00:19:30.899 --> 00:19:37.739
started our work there was a lot of

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:40.379
opposition and the media people would

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:44.099
never understand it because it was no

00:19:40.379 --> 00:19:46.379
such a sensation as you can say nothing

00:19:44.099 --> 00:19:48.299
to people feel excited but in a way it's

00:19:46.379 --> 00:19:50.669
very great thing because if this is the

00:19:48.299 --> 00:19:54.210
solution for the whole world one should

00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:56.940
try to do it then we had very late

00:19:54.210 --> 00:20:04.590
people who came to come to sahaja yoga

00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:07.590
like we can say the High Court judge who

00:20:04.590 --> 00:20:13.519
is now the president who has given

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:16.440
Nicaragua same judgment he and many

00:20:13.519 --> 00:20:20.129
lawyers and many barristers we have one

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:22.529
barrister here from Algeria and doctors

00:20:20.129 --> 00:20:25.289
and then they took over and they started

00:20:22.529 --> 00:20:29.849
helping me out how to propagate sahaja

00:20:25.289 --> 00:20:32.129
yoga but it was a difficult task in the

00:20:29.849 --> 00:20:34.529
West of course in India it spread very

00:20:32.129 --> 00:20:36.749
fast in the villages but City people in

00:20:34.529 --> 00:20:38.970
India also are westernized and they

00:20:36.749 --> 00:20:41.729
start analyzing they don't know much

00:20:38.970 --> 00:20:43.950
about our past they don't know anything

00:20:41.729 --> 00:20:46.349
about our heritage that we have over

00:20:43.950 --> 00:20:47.789
Kundalini non that but some people do

00:20:46.349 --> 00:20:50.220
know but self-realization

00:20:47.789 --> 00:20:51.869
but these gurus could not stick on in

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:54.840
India because nobody would accept them

00:20:51.869 --> 00:20:56.279
so it all ran away abroad and that was

00:20:54.840 --> 00:20:59.849
something of blessing for me also

00:20:56.279 --> 00:21:02.429
because I didn't have to fight them and

00:20:59.849 --> 00:21:04.950
it started working out and then people

00:21:02.429 --> 00:21:07.799
found that it helps in every way and

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:10.109
this found so many miracles about it and

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:13.169
that's how sahaja yoga what settled

00:21:10.109 --> 00:21:15.690
quite a lot but still I would say that

00:21:13.169 --> 00:21:19.049
we have not been to certain countries so

00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:21.280
far and in the West I would say that so

00:21:19.049 --> 00:21:34.139
much work has to be done

00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:37.089
[Music]

00:21:34.139 --> 00:21:39.039
as soon as you start any working

00:21:37.089 --> 00:21:42.099
anyplace first of all they want me to

00:21:39.039 --> 00:21:45.789
cure people and to help them with

00:21:42.099 --> 00:21:48.129
curative now if I pay attention more to

00:21:45.789 --> 00:21:50.559
that then the main work is to create

00:21:48.129 --> 00:21:53.019
doctors out of everyone that is

00:21:50.559 --> 00:21:55.239
neglected then you become unpopular they

00:21:53.019 --> 00:21:57.219
think oh she's not sympathetic and this

00:21:55.239 --> 00:21:59.109
and that but now as we have everybody

00:21:57.219 --> 00:22:01.539
can cure now everyone I don't cure

00:21:59.109 --> 00:22:03.279
anyone directly but they don't like it

00:22:01.539 --> 00:22:04.839
they want I should be there and there

00:22:03.279 --> 00:22:07.599
you go to be pampered and all those

00:22:04.839 --> 00:22:09.579
things are there rather difficult it's

00:22:07.599 --> 00:22:11.979
not we are not running an election you

00:22:09.579 --> 00:22:13.659
see like we should please other sort of

00:22:11.979 --> 00:22:14.519
thing is not there but whatever is

00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:18.879
reality

00:22:14.519 --> 00:22:21.579
if a person has intelligence pure

00:22:18.879 --> 00:22:23.950
intelligence we can see that this is

00:22:21.579 --> 00:22:29.249
something very different and for that

00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:34.450
one has to understand that you cannot

00:22:29.249 --> 00:22:36.339
you cannot force on anyone that you get

00:22:34.450 --> 00:22:38.739
your realization in the same way you

00:22:36.339 --> 00:22:40.570
cannot force me that I give you

00:22:38.739 --> 00:22:42.070
realization because if it does not work

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:45.899
it does not work with such a living

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:51.099
forces and that upsets them very soul I

00:22:45.899 --> 00:22:54.969
feel that the way this Industrial

00:22:51.099 --> 00:22:56.859
Revolution has come in the West people

00:22:54.969 --> 00:22:59.289
have lost their moorings perhaps they

00:22:56.859 --> 00:23:01.929
are so confused with all these gurus

00:22:59.289 --> 00:23:04.029
coming down here confusing them and all

00:23:01.929 --> 00:23:07.269
kinds of new things coming they don't

00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:10.779
know where to look but unless and until

00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:12.940
you get your evolution completed unless

00:23:10.779 --> 00:23:15.309
and until you reach that absolute state

00:23:12.940 --> 00:23:19.239
of understanding the chaos will remain

00:23:15.309 --> 00:23:21.009
so one has to try to get to that but one

00:23:19.239 --> 00:23:23.720
must understand you can't pay for it

00:23:21.009 --> 00:23:36.040
there's no effort

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:39.260
[Music]

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:42.260
it's another great thing has happened in

00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:46.580
Dell University that the Dell university

00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:50.960
is accepted that a person can do only a

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:53.870
doctor can do a PhD or we can say the

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:57.220
doctorate in sahaja yoga and he gets the

00:23:53.870 --> 00:24:01.130
highest degree called the doctor of

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:02.990
medicine and a perhaps maybe after

00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:05.840
sometime they will allow anyone to do

00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:08.030
that this is about the medicine part of

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:09.980
it in agriculture we have done lots of

00:24:08.030 --> 00:24:11.990
research myself you have somebody here

00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:15.050
an expert on agriculture

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:17.600
he is also done lot of research and we

00:24:15.050 --> 00:24:21.110
found out that with vibrations we start

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:24.650
after realization if you vibrate the

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:26.960
water and if you water the plants with

00:24:24.650 --> 00:24:28.850
that then sometimes you might get even

00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:31.970
ten times more breathe that's what they

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:34.010
did in India and one of the agricultural

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:36.380
university but here also he's found out

00:24:34.010 --> 00:24:39.080
that this tremendous difference between

00:24:36.380 --> 00:24:40.730
the growth of an ordinary thing another

00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.180
thing we have found out in agriculture

00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:48.440
that if you get vibrations then even an

00:24:44.180 --> 00:24:50.690
ordinary cow can give lot of milk but if

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:52.310
you have hybrid cows then you see they

00:24:50.690 --> 00:24:55.580
it's not good for the brain because a

00:24:52.310 --> 00:24:57.770
person who takes hybrid make also gets

00:24:55.580 --> 00:25:00.620
hybrid and his brain becomes little

00:24:57.770 --> 00:25:03.980
wobbly so better to have a pure milk

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:06.470
from a cow which is not being put to

00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:09.020
this kind of him experimentation

00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:11.000
moreover food also if it's hybrid food

00:25:09.020 --> 00:25:13.940
is not very good for us because that

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:15.920
spoils our nerves I think but ordinary

00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:18.370
seats you cannot choose because they

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:22.340
have weakened and they cannot reproduce

00:25:18.370 --> 00:25:23.420
so when we vibrate them they produce

00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:25.880
very well

00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:28.790
just like better than even sometimes

00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:30.350
hybrid things and the food is taste very

00:25:28.790 --> 00:25:32.510
well and he doesn't give those

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:35.510
complications so this can help in

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:37.700
agriculture in India and the government

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:40.160
has allotted a lot of land where we are

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:42.230
going to now experiment and we are going

00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:44.720
to start the experimentation there to

00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:46.760
show that how we can use this

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:49.240
but many farmers who are sahaja Yogi's

00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:53.590
have done a lot of job and they have

00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:55.970
discovered that even animals and this

00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:57.940
what you call farming

00:25:55.970 --> 00:26:00.120
everything is help very much my

00:25:57.940 --> 00:26:12.429
vibration

00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:14.490
[Music]

00:26:12.429 --> 00:26:14.490
you

00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:23.070
what do you think of the important

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:25.769
points in the education of children she

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:27.390
first if they if they get realization to

00:26:25.769 --> 00:26:29.640
get trust them to that point of

00:26:27.390 --> 00:26:31.380
realization if they're already born

00:26:29.640 --> 00:26:34.110
realized no problem but if they have

00:26:31.380 --> 00:26:36.029
their given realization then you see

00:26:34.110 --> 00:26:38.039
they start seeing from a different level

00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:43.350
they become the spirit so their self

00:26:38.039 --> 00:26:45.870
respect to see awaken so children behave

00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:48.690
in a very dignified elderly man are you

00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:51.000
see they talk in a very elderly manner

00:26:48.690 --> 00:26:54.120
and this gives solutions of all kinds

00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.940
you see and there are tremendous people

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:59.880
but we have to guide them properly by

00:26:56.940 --> 00:27:02.220
our own behavior how we behave the

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:05.480
greatest thing is how we behave that's

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:10.740
how the children run we put the children

00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:12.330
certain to some tests how they are we

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:14.760
find out if they have any physical

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:17.130
problems we cure them with a mental

00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:20.039
problem we cure them if they have any

00:27:17.130 --> 00:27:22.289
other problem social problem or anything

00:27:20.039 --> 00:27:24.899
we try to help them out so that

00:27:22.289 --> 00:27:27.870
basically if a human being is all right

00:27:24.899 --> 00:27:29.549
in the childhood then fundamentals are

00:27:27.870 --> 00:27:31.769
all right for the child the foundation

00:27:29.549 --> 00:27:35.100
is laid down then to build that child up

00:27:31.769 --> 00:27:38.279
into a good quality is not difficult so

00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:41.610
now we find like a great artist on there

00:27:38.279 --> 00:27:43.260
there are three positions and at a very

00:27:41.610 --> 00:27:45.330
young age they have started being well

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.549
why lean I mean suddenly they have

00:27:45.330 --> 00:27:49.860
become dynamic also and very humble

00:27:47.549 --> 00:27:52.260
they're very humble and self-respecting

00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:54.960
and very well-behaved it's surprising

00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:57.419
how atmosphere is and how it works out

00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:00.149
and the other day the lady asked me

00:27:57.419 --> 00:28:02.639
about the women and I told her that a

00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:04.919
woman's power as a mother is very great

00:28:02.639 --> 00:28:06.480
she felt hurt about it but I didn't mean

00:28:04.919 --> 00:28:08.610
that you should be just a mother what

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:11.610
I'm saying she is a mother means she's

00:28:08.610 --> 00:28:14.279
compassionate she's kind she's not

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:16.230
aggressive like man that is a very big

00:28:14.279 --> 00:28:17.850
quality that's a very big power in a

00:28:16.230 --> 00:28:19.980
woman that's what I was suggesting that

00:28:17.850 --> 00:28:22.350
that is what we have brought us not to

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:27.760
compete with men it's madness we have to

00:28:22.350 --> 00:28:33.110
understand that life has to be

00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:35.780
in job nights be a blessing not to be a

00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:40.990
misery we create our own miseries by

00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:43.460
these false ideas by our own con

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:46.160
confusions we have in our mind mental

00:28:43.460 --> 00:28:48.890
projections we have in our mind or our

00:28:46.160 --> 00:28:52.070
own obstinacy whatever it is all these

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:53.480
things can be cured if you take to

00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:55.820
sahaja yoga because you've become a

00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:57.710
balanced person level-headed wise person

00:28:55.820 --> 00:29:00.320
and you become a witness the whole thing

00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:01.970
becomes like a show like a drama and you

00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:03.890
become fearless you start seeing the

00:29:01.970 --> 00:29:06.020
whole thing like a drama and this is

00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:09.590
what a human being has to achieve we

00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:11.900
talk of peace we talk of no war we talk

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:14.360
of many things like this you see atomic

00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:16.370
bomb this that all that is not going to

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.860
work out only what is going to work out

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:20.660
is the transformation of human beings if

00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:23.480
the human beings are transformed things

00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:27.080
will work out absolutely first-class not

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:30.230
only that but that they will enjoy the

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:33.950
Bliss of life we are missing the point

00:29:30.230 --> 00:29:36.800
altogether this is a very important

00:29:33.950 --> 00:29:38.720
thing that human beings must say one

00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:43.360
thing what have you achieved out of all

00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:56.490
this just for a minute to stop and think

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:59.800
[Music]

00:29:56.490 --> 00:30:02.410
or illnesses are caused by the

00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:04.990
imbalances in within us by our extreme

00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:07.810
behavior and supposing say now the

00:30:04.990 --> 00:30:11.440
cancer we can take the cancer is cancer

00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:15.150
is caused by the over activity of the

00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:20.200
sympathetic nervous system supposing a

00:30:15.150 --> 00:30:22.960
person is a very sad person he cries and

00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:25.150
we said all the times feels guilty and

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.490
thinks that he's the first person ever

00:30:25.150 --> 00:30:30.370
born he's committed so many sins and all

00:30:27.490 --> 00:30:32.710
sorts of nonsense he then he goes to the

00:30:30.370 --> 00:30:34.420
left side according to us and crosses

00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:37.210
over to the collective subconscious area

00:30:34.420 --> 00:30:41.020
and there according to us what they call

00:30:37.210 --> 00:30:42.550
as protein 58 and protein 52 doctors

00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:45.610
call it that way but we call it as the

00:30:42.550 --> 00:30:48.130
Dead Souls they existed and they catch

00:30:45.610 --> 00:30:50.800
hold of you and they trigger the cancer

00:30:48.130 --> 00:30:53.250
but supposing by any chance you can

00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:57.160
bring the attention fully away from that

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:59.650
in the center you can get your so it is

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:03.160
the centers within us which are subtle

00:30:59.650 --> 00:31:05.440
which are basically seven centers there

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:07.060
are many others but basically seven if

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:10.600
you can put them right you cannot have

00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:23.519
any sickness or illness of any kind

learn a lot from him he was not taller

00:31:28.899 --> 00:31:36.039
he put it that's one thing and he was

00:31:32.169 --> 00:31:38.529
not like modern he says the politicians

00:31:36.039 --> 00:31:41.320
who say something to something no it's

00:31:38.529 --> 00:31:45.669
very outspoken and always he put himself

00:31:41.320 --> 00:31:47.909
on the testing point and he used to

00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:51.279
confess if you made mistakes immediately

00:31:47.909 --> 00:31:54.039
one very great incident I remember when

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:57.729
I was a small child they were having a

00:31:54.039 --> 00:32:01.029
meeting together and we got stood there

00:31:57.729 --> 00:32:03.659
only sitting giving them water and

00:32:01.029 --> 00:32:07.119
things to all the people all the big

00:32:03.659 --> 00:32:09.699
people were there like Yamaha Leo was

00:32:07.119 --> 00:32:11.679
there and also Maulana Azad all these

00:32:09.699 --> 00:32:14.169
people who are sitting there no

00:32:11.679 --> 00:32:16.299
discussing something and then suddenly

00:32:14.169 --> 00:32:20.739
not when he said that now it's very late

00:32:16.299 --> 00:32:22.839
we'll have lunch air so they said yes

00:32:20.739 --> 00:32:24.609
this we'll have lunch here they had to

00:32:22.839 --> 00:32:28.449
go to the guest house which was far away

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:31.089
so but what he asked for the mice

00:32:28.449 --> 00:32:33.339
through his wife shared one out so he

00:32:31.089 --> 00:32:35.499
got up he had a key with him he always

00:32:33.339 --> 00:32:38.859
of the storeroom you opened the store

00:32:35.499 --> 00:32:39.729
and he asked the people who were in

00:32:38.859 --> 00:32:42.789
charge of cooking

00:32:39.729 --> 00:32:45.190
to measure everything according to the

00:32:42.789 --> 00:32:48.190
people there are properly everything you

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:50.139
see and then he when they measured it

00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:52.569
out everything was done then he put the

00:32:50.139 --> 00:32:56.739
key back and then he went inside then

00:32:52.569 --> 00:32:59.409
ask so these people said we did not know

00:32:56.739 --> 00:33:05.259
you have to take so much trouble you see

00:32:59.409 --> 00:33:08.859
too much time out fifteen minutes but

00:33:05.259 --> 00:33:11.229
still so he said what do you think this

00:33:08.859 --> 00:33:13.839
is the blood of my country I cannot

00:33:11.229 --> 00:33:16.359
allow it to be wasted see that's the

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:18.459
sign of a person who understands the

00:33:16.359 --> 00:33:22.269
value of public money that's just

00:33:18.459 --> 00:33:25.599
ingrained in him but those who saw him

00:33:22.269 --> 00:33:28.359
also felt that look at this man who is

00:33:25.599 --> 00:33:30.369
living like a ascetic absolutely in the

00:33:28.359 --> 00:33:33.789
sense that he would not touch the public

00:33:30.369 --> 00:33:35.559
money and that is one of the key keys

00:33:33.789 --> 00:33:40.029
for all the leaders if they are

00:33:35.559 --> 00:33:42.279
absolutely about money then only people

00:33:40.029 --> 00:33:45.069
with respect otherwise there's no way

00:33:42.279 --> 00:33:47.759
out but you find these days in every

00:33:45.069 --> 00:33:51.749
country so much of corruption hypocrisy

00:33:47.759 --> 00:33:51.749
we were really shocked
