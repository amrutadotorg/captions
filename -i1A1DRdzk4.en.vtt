00:17.000 --> 00:34.380
[Music]

00:29.420 --> 00:39.800
I'd belong to a family of very

00:34.380 --> 00:39.800
enlightened people my father was a

00:40.190 --> 00:48.239
linguist and he was mastered of 14

00:43.140 --> 00:53.010
languages he knew about 26 languages and

00:48.239 --> 00:59.489
he translated even karana sharif into

00:53.010 --> 01:05.489
Hindi language my mother was in those

00:59.489 --> 01:09.180
days was honours in mathematics so both

01:05.489 --> 01:19.920
were very well educated and enlightened

01:09.180 --> 01:24.600
people at the time of my birth my mother

01:19.920 --> 01:27.509
dreamt something which she could not

01:24.600 --> 01:31.380
explain but after that she had a great

01:27.509 --> 01:35.240
desire to go and see a tiger in the open

01:31.380 --> 01:38.459
field my father was a great hunter

01:35.240 --> 01:40.979
because Tigers were the meanest in the

01:38.459 --> 01:43.520
area where we were living it was a hill

01:40.979 --> 01:45.929
station called Xinhua

01:43.520 --> 01:49.470
so there was a king who was very much

01:45.929 --> 01:52.649
interested in my father somehow other a

01:49.470 --> 01:55.259
letter came that there's a tiger very

01:52.649 --> 01:56.880
big tiger that has appeared and they're

01:55.259 --> 01:58.789
frightened of him that he might be a

01:56.880 --> 02:03.899
maneater

01:58.789 --> 02:07.800
so my father took my mother and me to

02:03.899 --> 02:09.840
that place and they were sitting what we

02:07.800 --> 02:13.950
call as a mechon where they bid

02:09.840 --> 02:19.459
something for people to sit on top of a

02:13.950 --> 02:22.380
tree from where they can shoot nicely

02:19.459 --> 02:26.310
and then my mother tells me that a big

02:22.380 --> 02:30.060
huge tiger of a very big size very

02:26.310 --> 02:32.959
beautifully appeared on the field and

02:30.060 --> 02:40.129
she felt tremendous love for the tiger

02:32.959 --> 02:40.129
it was a full moon day and she felt

02:40.190 --> 02:45.900
extremely compassionate towards the

02:42.750 --> 02:48.510
tiger and when my father raised his gun

02:45.900 --> 02:52.170
to shoot she stopped and she wouldn't

02:48.510 --> 02:56.130
allow when the Tiger went away and he

02:52.170 --> 02:59.250
never came to that forest again but that

02:56.130 --> 03:02.040
made my father think because he himself

02:59.250 --> 03:07.530
was a realized soul that must be

03:02.040 --> 03:12.150
somebody what we call a goddess durga

03:07.530 --> 03:15.989
who is fond of the tiger must be bought

03:12.150 --> 03:18.630
on to my mother because the symptoms

03:15.989 --> 03:21.930
were rather funny that lady should like

03:18.630 --> 03:24.000
to see a tiger ever so he told my mother

03:21.930 --> 03:25.410
now are you satisfied because they were

03:24.000 --> 03:28.019
struggling with the gun he said he's

03:25.410 --> 03:31.769
there and Durga sitting in your womb

03:28.019 --> 03:33.959
that you are trying to protect the tiger

03:31.769 --> 03:37.050
she said yes yes so stop it now I won't

03:33.959 --> 03:39.720
allow me like that there were many

03:37.050 --> 03:43.650
incidents in my life because I am off a

03:39.720 --> 03:45.810
Christian family brought distance and

03:43.650 --> 03:47.910
when I was born my mother didn't feel

03:45.810 --> 03:51.450
any labor pains or anything and just I

03:47.910 --> 03:53.549
was born she didn't know how and I had

03:51.450 --> 03:56.010
no blood on my body nothing I was clean

03:53.549 --> 04:00.180
washed that's why they called me I knew

03:56.010 --> 04:02.280
as their mana but my grandmother said

04:00.180 --> 04:05.549
that she should be called as Nishka

04:02.280 --> 04:07.730
lanka that means the one which has no

04:05.549 --> 04:09.840
spots on it but that's the name of math

04:07.730 --> 04:14.760
so they said all right we'll call her

04:09.840 --> 04:16.650
Nirmala meaning the same immaculate now

04:14.760 --> 04:20.190
all these incidents and then my father

04:16.650 --> 04:23.610
being a realized soul he felt tremendous

04:20.190 --> 04:29.280
vibrations from me and he felt that this

04:23.610 --> 04:33.090
life is great and she do something

04:29.280 --> 04:35.039
reaching this life I do not know why but

04:33.090 --> 04:38.520
I don't know if he dreamt or he

04:35.039 --> 04:40.470
understood it but all the time if I

04:38.520 --> 04:43.190
remember when he talked to me he used to

04:40.470 --> 04:47.000
say that you have to find out a way of

04:43.190 --> 04:50.370
giving a masse realization all the time

04:47.000 --> 04:52.650
as I told he was a great scholar of so

04:50.370 --> 04:56.790
many things and very

04:52.650 --> 04:59.520
widely that man so he gave me a good

04:56.790 --> 05:02.720
education in religion

04:59.520 --> 05:05.460
in different religions and also good

05:02.720 --> 05:08.280
education about human beings what are

05:05.460 --> 05:10.919
their problems why did he act like this

05:08.280 --> 05:13.410
why don't they take to God why are the

05:10.919 --> 05:16.080
hypocritical all kinds of things he

05:13.410 --> 05:19.740
talked to me he also knew about

05:16.080 --> 05:24.090
Kundalini but not so much of course when

05:19.740 --> 05:27.150
I was born I knew about Kundalini myself

05:24.090 --> 05:29.190
I knew all about it from my very

05:27.150 --> 05:32.220
childhood it was very aware person

05:29.190 --> 05:34.110
extremely aware I didn't know how to

05:32.220 --> 05:36.150
talk to because see people didn't have

05:34.110 --> 05:39.300
that awareness you can't talk to

05:36.150 --> 05:41.280
everyone like that so I was regarded as

05:39.300 --> 05:45.840
a very jolly person at the same time

05:41.280 --> 05:49.320
very serious also very deep and then I

05:45.840 --> 06:01.670
started my studies as a child

05:49.320 --> 06:05.000
[Music]

06:01.670 --> 06:08.270
I was not very much interested in the

06:05.000 --> 06:10.700
study's bias to do very well but I used

06:08.270 --> 06:14.450
to read lives of great men and things

06:10.700 --> 06:17.560
like that at a very young age I were not

06:14.450 --> 06:19.550
shocked when people were reading justly

06:17.560 --> 06:22.220
expectations I was reading but not

06:19.550 --> 06:24.800
shocked but as such I didn't have

06:22.220 --> 06:26.210
interest in particularly reading some

06:24.800 --> 06:28.130
textbooks because I thought they were

06:26.210 --> 06:32.030
childish and when there's nothing to

06:28.130 --> 06:33.890
read about it then I told my father that

06:32.030 --> 06:35.830
I have to do medicine so he said why I

06:33.890 --> 06:38.210
said because I have to talk to doctors

06:35.830 --> 06:41.840
he said you have to talk to doctor us

06:38.210 --> 06:43.490
yes I said but it so happen in my

06:41.840 --> 06:47.660
childhood when I was about 7 years of

06:43.490 --> 06:49.040
age my father was a congressman he had

06:47.660 --> 06:52.160
joined Congress when I was four years

06:49.040 --> 06:54.140
old he is totally with the style with

06:52.160 --> 06:56.480
the westernized his clothes west East

06:54.140 --> 06:58.610
England and sort of a man we had

06:56.480 --> 07:02.810
governesses in order you threw away

06:58.610 --> 07:08.720
everything maybe real Indian and started

07:02.810 --> 07:12.950
leading a life of Amartya then he made a

07:08.720 --> 07:15.740
study our language is Sanskrit he made

07:12.950 --> 07:17.540
me study in an Indian school not in a

07:15.740 --> 07:20.060
missionary school because missionaries

07:17.540 --> 07:21.680
were very unkind they threw us out of

07:20.060 --> 07:24.820
the school when my father was in the

07:21.680 --> 07:27.700
Congress they were against us completely

07:24.820 --> 07:32.510
then at the age of seven years I

07:27.700 --> 07:36.440
happened to go with my father to heart

07:32.510 --> 07:38.060
ma Gandhi he was about 72 mice living

07:36.440 --> 07:40.490
with us but the first time he took me

07:38.060 --> 07:43.490
down and madman and he liked me very

07:40.490 --> 07:45.260
much he said leave this child with me so

07:43.490 --> 07:47.900
I had not been taken clothes or anything

07:45.260 --> 07:52.850
I stayed on when my father sent me

07:47.900 --> 07:55.310
everything with him and it was very fond

07:52.850 --> 07:56.600
of me but I was a little girl but she

07:55.310 --> 07:59.860
understood that there was something

07:56.600 --> 08:03.680
about me he consulted me on very serious

07:59.860 --> 08:07.370
problems sometimes surprisingly like one

08:03.680 --> 08:09.710
day he wanted to make the prayer book

08:07.370 --> 08:12.800
all right so he asked me how should I

08:09.710 --> 08:14.020
put the series and all that so I told me

08:12.800 --> 08:16.419
how to

08:14.020 --> 08:20.500
series and he put the series in that way

08:16.419 --> 08:23.470
I used to go back for my spoon and again

08:20.500 --> 08:27.039
go back to manager every year like that

08:23.470 --> 08:27.819
and he called me Nepali give me a name

08:27.039 --> 08:29.800
Nepali

08:27.819 --> 08:35.110
everybody used to call me Nepali that

08:29.800 --> 08:37.570
time then I grew up with him very

08:35.110 --> 08:39.399
intimately it was a very very kind

08:37.570 --> 08:41.860
person for children otherwise an

08:39.399 --> 08:43.870
extremely strict man with himself and

08:41.860 --> 08:47.709
with others very strict a big

08:43.870 --> 08:49.540
disciplinarian and he would make

08:47.709 --> 08:51.360
everybody get up at 4 o clock have your

08:49.540 --> 08:54.279
baths everything be ready for your

08:51.360 --> 08:56.140
morning prayers at 5 o clock you see and

08:54.279 --> 08:58.329
used to walk very fast I also learnt

08:56.140 --> 09:02.079
walking fast with him in his company had

08:58.329 --> 09:04.839
to walk fast and with extremely loving

09:02.079 --> 09:06.850
and a very nice person and he would

09:04.839 --> 09:08.260
listen to me because I was a child

09:06.850 --> 09:10.329
you see supposing I forced him to eat

09:08.260 --> 09:14.680
more or something than he would in love

09:10.329 --> 09:16.329
he would accept very kindly person but

09:14.680 --> 09:17.890
with others was very strict and I used

09:16.329 --> 09:21.490
to tell him that why you restrict with

09:17.890 --> 09:23.290
him to burn he said but you are a little

09:21.490 --> 09:24.700
girl you get up in the morning time why

09:23.290 --> 09:26.709
can't I get up I said I am literally

09:24.700 --> 09:28.240
that's why I get up that big so they

09:26.709 --> 09:32.589
can't get up like that I see little

09:28.240 --> 09:34.540
chats and then my father went to jail

09:32.589 --> 09:37.690
and my mother also went to jail five

09:34.540 --> 09:39.310
times my father went to jail twice once

09:37.690 --> 09:41.410
for about two and a half years and he

09:39.310 --> 09:44.680
was the only supporting member of the

09:41.410 --> 09:47.860
family by the way we come from a very

09:44.680 --> 09:50.620
old royal family which is called a

09:47.860 --> 09:55.390
shalivahanas they have a calendar also

09:50.620 --> 09:59.350
in India and then when we I mean when

09:55.390 --> 10:01.570
they took my father to jail we had to

09:59.350 --> 10:04.690
leave our house and to live in hearts

10:01.570 --> 10:07.270
and in all problems that was nothing but

10:04.690 --> 10:09.730
also me they've tested a lot because I

10:07.270 --> 10:11.560
helped many people there and I joined

10:09.730 --> 10:13.510
the 42 movement in a very serious way

10:11.560 --> 10:14.950
and I became the leader here for the

10:13.510 --> 10:18.459
young people I thought unless and until

10:14.950 --> 10:21.420
I take a very positive stand it may not

10:18.459 --> 10:21.420
work out with them

10:22.230 --> 10:27.240
it's not vicious to say how are they

10:24.269 --> 10:29.040
tortured me what they did to me but they

10:27.240 --> 10:32.610
really tortured me I was a young girl of

10:29.040 --> 10:36.839
nineteen years that time it's over now

10:32.610 --> 10:39.240
so it's finished and after that we my

10:36.839 --> 10:42.570
father went to really again and then

10:39.240 --> 10:45.660
when he came back he got elected as the

10:42.570 --> 10:48.510
member of the central Assembly later on

10:45.660 --> 10:49.470
as the Constituent Assembly and then at

10:48.510 --> 10:51.690
the Parliament

10:49.470 --> 10:55.380
my brother was also a member of the

10:51.690 --> 10:59.519
Parliament later on now recently he was

10:55.380 --> 11:03.140
the minister in the cabinet another

10:59.519 --> 11:05.730
brother is a High Court judge in Bombay

11:03.140 --> 11:08.910
they are all being well despite the fact

11:05.730 --> 11:10.649
that our parents and neglected us in a

11:08.910 --> 11:13.560
way because they gave their lives of the

11:10.649 --> 11:16.399
country but you see that never debtor as

11:13.560 --> 11:19.980
from studies and we came up very well

11:16.399 --> 11:22.410
then I when I was in 42 whom went to see

11:19.980 --> 11:24.810
my college desta gated me from the

11:22.410 --> 11:28.050
college they threw me out and I had to

11:24.810 --> 11:29.370
go to another college to study far away

11:28.050 --> 11:34.199
from my house

11:29.370 --> 11:38.779
he went out but I studied for two years

11:34.199 --> 11:42.360
science I did then I did my medical I

11:38.779 --> 11:45.209
didn't do fully because just after that

11:42.360 --> 11:46.920
the 47 riots broke out so College was

11:45.209 --> 11:48.870
closed and I didn't want to know more

11:46.920 --> 11:51.990
because what I wanted to know I came to

11:48.870 --> 11:55.260
know about it so I did not need and I

11:51.990 --> 11:57.420
got married you must have heard my

11:55.260 --> 11:58.769
husband was is now the secretary-general

11:57.420 --> 12:01.350
of the International Maritime

11:58.769 --> 12:05.550
Organization he held a very high

12:01.350 --> 12:07.440
positions he was also secretary to Al

12:05.550 --> 12:09.449
Bahadur Shastri who was our prime

12:07.440 --> 12:11.610
minister who was another very great man

12:09.449 --> 12:13.709
but he did not survive long if you had

12:11.610 --> 12:15.390
survived things would have been

12:13.709 --> 12:18.060
different I think for our country

12:15.390 --> 12:21.089
because he was a Gandhian out-and-out

12:18.060 --> 12:23.560
panthéon and he lived like it ideal

12:21.089 --> 12:36.580
mantheon personality

12:23.560 --> 12:42.080
[Music]

12:36.580 --> 12:46.339
so that's how life went on but inner

12:42.080 --> 12:49.270
being was still seeking the way and

12:46.339 --> 12:52.940
methods of giving amass realization

12:49.270 --> 12:56.540
my father said before you do not develop

12:52.940 --> 12:58.790
this technique of giving a mass

12:56.540 --> 13:00.440
sterilization don't talk of religion let

12:58.790 --> 13:01.010
nobody know that you know anything about

13:00.440 --> 13:04.339
it

13:01.010 --> 13:06.140
because they'll crucify you or he was

13:04.339 --> 13:07.700
rather worried that people won't

13:06.140 --> 13:10.580
understand or you may write another

13:07.700 --> 13:13.370
Bible or Gita no use first of all you

13:10.580 --> 13:14.839
must give them realization if they get

13:13.370 --> 13:18.710
their realization then they will realize

13:14.839 --> 13:21.440
that there's something about about this

13:18.710 --> 13:23.870
human awareness for example he always

13:21.440 --> 13:26.120
used to give an analogy supposing you

13:23.870 --> 13:28.310
are born on the 10th story and

13:26.120 --> 13:30.529
everybody's on the ground you must at

13:28.310 --> 13:32.000
least make them climb two stories so

13:30.529 --> 13:35.120
they know there's something about it

13:32.000 --> 13:38.240
otherwise no use talking about it and he

13:35.120 --> 13:40.820
said this is the mistake between the

13:38.240 --> 13:42.260
Saints and the incarnations was that

13:40.820 --> 13:44.540
they never realized that these people

13:42.260 --> 13:49.190
are still on the ground they have to

13:44.540 --> 13:50.779
still enter into the reading so that is

13:49.190 --> 13:52.940
what you have to be very careful that

13:50.779 --> 13:53.860
first of all you must give realization

13:52.940 --> 13:57.709
to me

13:53.860 --> 14:00.830
so I was seeking the ways and methods

13:57.709 --> 14:03.320
working it out inside myself through my

14:00.830 --> 14:05.209
own style of meditation in the sense

14:03.320 --> 14:07.070
that I would work out all the

14:05.209 --> 14:09.920
permutations and combinations supposing

14:07.070 --> 14:12.200
I met one person then I would see what

14:09.920 --> 14:15.200
problems that person had how you can

14:12.200 --> 14:19.520
overcome it like that I would try to

14:15.200 --> 14:21.920
study that person internally and I went

14:19.520 --> 14:24.860
to many people find out but I found

14:21.920 --> 14:27.110
everybody booklets I saw so many of

14:24.860 --> 14:29.140
these gurus most of them I saw them I

14:27.110 --> 14:33.770
was surprised they were all hypocrites

14:29.140 --> 14:36.680
money making and staying and also I went

14:33.770 --> 14:40.640
to Rajneesh also to see him then he said

14:36.680 --> 14:41.959
that I should come to his table I didn't

14:40.640 --> 14:43.700
know what sort of a man because he was

14:41.959 --> 14:44.930
talking about eat and even things I

14:43.700 --> 14:48.290
thought you might be knowing something

14:44.930 --> 14:49.760
about it went that but my husband said

14:48.290 --> 14:52.220
no I won't allow to go to

14:49.760 --> 14:53.930
so he arranged his own mother no and all

14:52.220 --> 14:56.120
that for me so I went down there and

14:53.930 --> 14:58.250
there I couldn't see all the things that

14:56.120 --> 15:00.980
were going on and that is the day

14:58.250 --> 15:03.170
somehow or other I said I must open the

15:00.980 --> 15:07.790
last chakra so the last chakra was open

15:03.170 --> 15:10.190
and I saw the Kundalini which is the

15:07.790 --> 15:13.820
primordial force within us which is the

15:10.190 --> 15:19.190
Holy Ghost within us rising like a

15:13.820 --> 15:23.240
telescope opening out and then I saw the

15:19.190 --> 15:26.750
whole thing open and a big torrential

15:23.240 --> 15:30.170
rain of grease started flowing through

15:26.750 --> 15:32.180
my head all over as if and I felt I'm

15:30.170 --> 15:35.000
lost now I have no more there it's only

15:32.180 --> 15:36.860
that place is that the that is there I

15:35.000 --> 15:43.070
saw it completely happening to me

15:36.860 --> 15:44.990
and but I was amazed that when I went to

15:43.070 --> 15:46.279
the Janine's you see because before

15:44.990 --> 15:47.660
going out to say goodbye he never

15:46.279 --> 15:50.870
realized what had happened or anything

15:47.660 --> 15:53.899
else so I was surprised I said this man

15:50.870 --> 15:55.130
doesn't know anything about God and then

15:53.899 --> 16:00.829
I discovered that they were all

15:55.130 --> 16:05.089
hypocrites and telling lies so in 1973

16:00.829 --> 16:09.110
this happened on 5th of May 17 1970

16:05.089 --> 16:11.329
fifth of May and just after that I we

16:09.110 --> 16:13.399
had a very big lecture in Jahangir all

16:11.329 --> 16:14.720
this already be gone and thousands of

16:13.399 --> 16:17.180
people had to come I told them very

16:14.720 --> 16:18.769
frankly that these are all thugs and

16:17.180 --> 16:21.319
these are like this appropriate some of

16:18.769 --> 16:23.300
them are demonic some are evil people I

16:21.319 --> 16:25.279
took their names everything I told them

16:23.300 --> 16:28.670
don't go near them there were some

16:25.279 --> 16:30.740
foreigners also and there were so many

16:28.670 --> 16:33.050
others whom I told these things very

16:30.740 --> 16:34.430
clearly and they got frightened they

16:33.050 --> 16:35.990
said you shouldn't say like this they

16:34.430 --> 16:38.180
will come and murder you they will do I

16:35.990 --> 16:40.279
said let them come and murder me but

16:38.180 --> 16:44.600
nobody does anything nobody even went to

16:40.279 --> 16:47.690
the courts and that's how you see they

16:44.600 --> 16:49.699
tried to bring bad name to me they paid

16:47.690 --> 16:51.889
money to the newspapers to publish

16:49.699 --> 16:54.230
things against me because I said you

16:51.889 --> 16:58.519
cannot pay money so they thought that I

16:54.230 --> 17:00.290
was just trying to see harm them by

16:58.519 --> 17:02.660
saying such a thing that you can't earn

17:00.290 --> 17:03.270
money in the name of war if it's a job

17:02.660 --> 17:08.420
you can

17:03.270 --> 17:11.940
but God's work is not a job and the

17:08.420 --> 17:15.270
struggle started from the day I started

17:11.940 --> 17:17.910
giving realization and I started with

17:15.270 --> 17:21.150
one lady know what realization first

17:17.910 --> 17:24.390
then we got about 12 people who got

17:21.150 --> 17:29.130
realization in two years I got only

17:24.390 --> 17:31.440
about 14 people realization then

17:29.130 --> 17:33.120
gradually went 14 people got realization

17:31.440 --> 17:36.570
then many others started getting

17:33.120 --> 17:39.440
realization but I started also curing

17:36.570 --> 17:44.100
people because that was helping a lot

17:39.440 --> 17:46.370
then my house my husband got elected to

17:44.100 --> 17:49.260
this post and we had to come to London

17:46.370 --> 17:51.210
so when I came to London we had one

17:49.260 --> 17:54.000
program in party with everyone they

17:51.210 --> 17:56.250
arranged it so the Indians abroad are

17:54.000 --> 17:58.680
not so much interested in God they were

17:56.250 --> 18:01.130
more interested in money so now the

17:58.680 --> 18:05.280
Indian stayed there they all ran away

18:01.130 --> 18:08.370
and only the foreigners who were there

18:05.280 --> 18:10.080
when about seven hippies so I had to

18:08.370 --> 18:15.030
work on them seven hippies for four

18:10.080 --> 18:17.970
years I was working difficult to see the

18:15.030 --> 18:20.850
earlier was back that inhale the head

18:17.970 --> 18:23.670
was all terrible times but in between

18:20.850 --> 18:25.110
eyes to go to India and in India also

18:23.670 --> 18:27.630
the work was done for three months

18:25.110 --> 18:29.180
always I would be in India so we started

18:27.630 --> 18:32.100
working in the villages especially

18:29.180 --> 18:33.960
surprisingly where my forefathers were

18:32.100 --> 18:36.780
ruling in that area the were started

18:33.960 --> 18:39.090
moving in a very big way and there then

18:36.780 --> 18:42.690
we started taking some people from India

18:39.090 --> 18:46.200
then some people came from Australia to

18:42.690 --> 18:49.950
India like that and the work started

18:46.200 --> 18:52.740
moving in those direction now gradually

18:49.950 --> 18:54.720
the work improved and people found that

18:52.740 --> 18:57.510
this is the way we can transform

18:54.720 --> 19:01.440
ourselves many people were taking drugs

18:57.510 --> 19:02.880
or alcohol or mad people answered people

19:01.440 --> 19:05.070
they felt better

19:02.880 --> 19:06.780
then they got cured and it was

19:05.070 --> 19:12.360
established that sahaja yoga is

19:06.780 --> 19:15.180
something really important now when I

19:12.360 --> 19:17.159
travel all over the world you see first

19:15.180 --> 19:20.639
of my husband used to pay for every

19:17.159 --> 19:22.470
thing whenever I went she had to pay any

19:20.639 --> 19:25.169
expenses he is to do for me

19:22.470 --> 19:27.869
gradually then now these people pay for

19:25.169 --> 19:30.899
my travel but otherwise they don't have

19:27.869 --> 19:33.539
to pay for anything else that's how we

19:30.899 --> 19:37.739
started our work there was a lot of

19:33.539 --> 19:40.379
opposition and the media people would

19:37.739 --> 19:44.099
never understand it because it was no

19:40.379 --> 19:46.379
such a sensation as you can say nothing

19:44.099 --> 19:48.299
to people feel excited but in a way it's

19:46.379 --> 19:50.669
very great thing because if this is the

19:48.299 --> 19:54.210
solution for the whole world one should

19:50.669 --> 19:56.940
try to do it then we had very late

19:54.210 --> 20:04.590
people who came to come to sahaja yoga

19:56.940 --> 20:07.590
like we can say the High Court judge who

20:04.590 --> 20:13.519
is now the president who has given

20:07.590 --> 20:16.440
Nicaragua same judgment he and many

20:13.519 --> 20:20.129
lawyers and many barristers we have one

20:16.440 --> 20:22.529
barrister here from Algeria and doctors

20:20.129 --> 20:25.289
and then they took over and they started

20:22.529 --> 20:29.849
helping me out how to propagate sahaja

20:25.289 --> 20:32.129
yoga but it was a difficult task in the

20:29.849 --> 20:34.529
West of course in India it spread very

20:32.129 --> 20:36.749
fast in the villages but City people in

20:34.529 --> 20:38.970
India also are westernized and they

20:36.749 --> 20:41.729
start analyzing they don't know much

20:38.970 --> 20:43.950
about our past they don't know anything

20:41.729 --> 20:46.349
about our heritage that we have over

20:43.950 --> 20:47.789
Kundalini non that but some people do

20:46.349 --> 20:50.220
know but self-realization

20:47.789 --> 20:51.869
but these gurus could not stick on in

20:50.220 --> 20:54.840
India because nobody would accept them

20:51.869 --> 20:56.279
so it all ran away abroad and that was

20:54.840 --> 20:59.849
something of blessing for me also

20:56.279 --> 21:02.429
because I didn't have to fight them and

20:59.849 --> 21:04.950
it started working out and then people

21:02.429 --> 21:07.799
found that it helps in every way and

21:04.950 --> 21:10.109
this found so many miracles about it and

21:07.799 --> 21:13.169
that's how sahaja yoga what settled

21:10.109 --> 21:15.690
quite a lot but still I would say that

21:13.169 --> 21:19.049
we have not been to certain countries so

21:15.690 --> 21:21.280
far and in the West I would say that so

21:19.049 --> 21:34.139
much work has to be done

21:21.280 --> 21:37.089
[Music]

21:34.139 --> 21:39.039
as soon as you start any working

21:37.089 --> 21:42.099
anyplace first of all they want me to

21:39.039 --> 21:45.789
cure people and to help them with

21:42.099 --> 21:48.129
curative now if I pay attention more to

21:45.789 --> 21:50.559
that then the main work is to create

21:48.129 --> 21:53.019
doctors out of everyone that is

21:50.559 --> 21:55.239
neglected then you become unpopular they

21:53.019 --> 21:57.219
think oh she's not sympathetic and this

21:55.239 --> 21:59.109
and that but now as we have everybody

21:57.219 --> 22:01.539
can cure now everyone I don't cure

21:59.109 --> 22:03.279
anyone directly but they don't like it

22:01.539 --> 22:04.839
they want I should be there and there

22:03.279 --> 22:07.599
you go to be pampered and all those

22:04.839 --> 22:09.579
things are there rather difficult it's

22:07.599 --> 22:11.979
not we are not running an election you

22:09.579 --> 22:13.659
see like we should please other sort of

22:11.979 --> 22:14.519
thing is not there but whatever is

22:13.659 --> 22:18.879
reality

22:14.519 --> 22:21.579
if a person has intelligence pure

22:18.879 --> 22:23.950
intelligence we can see that this is

22:21.579 --> 22:29.249
something very different and for that

22:23.950 --> 22:34.450
one has to understand that you cannot

22:29.249 --> 22:36.339
you cannot force on anyone that you get

22:34.450 --> 22:38.739
your realization in the same way you

22:36.339 --> 22:40.570
cannot force me that I give you

22:38.739 --> 22:42.070
realization because if it does not work

22:40.570 --> 22:45.899
it does not work with such a living

22:42.070 --> 22:51.099
forces and that upsets them very soul I

22:45.899 --> 22:54.969
feel that the way this Industrial

22:51.099 --> 22:56.859
Revolution has come in the West people

22:54.969 --> 22:59.289
have lost their moorings perhaps they

22:56.859 --> 23:01.929
are so confused with all these gurus

22:59.289 --> 23:04.029
coming down here confusing them and all

23:01.929 --> 23:07.269
kinds of new things coming they don't

23:04.029 --> 23:10.779
know where to look but unless and until

23:07.269 --> 23:12.940
you get your evolution completed unless

23:10.779 --> 23:15.309
and until you reach that absolute state

23:12.940 --> 23:19.239
of understanding the chaos will remain

23:15.309 --> 23:21.009
so one has to try to get to that but one

23:19.239 --> 23:23.720
must understand you can't pay for it

23:21.009 --> 23:36.040
there's no effort

23:23.720 --> 23:39.260
[Music]

23:36.040 --> 23:42.260
it's another great thing has happened in

23:39.260 --> 23:46.580
Dell University that the Dell university

23:42.260 --> 23:50.960
is accepted that a person can do only a

23:46.580 --> 23:53.870
doctor can do a PhD or we can say the

23:50.960 --> 23:57.220
doctorate in sahaja yoga and he gets the

23:53.870 --> 24:01.130
highest degree called the doctor of

23:57.220 --> 24:02.990
medicine and a perhaps maybe after

24:01.130 --> 24:05.840
sometime they will allow anyone to do

24:02.990 --> 24:08.030
that this is about the medicine part of

24:05.840 --> 24:09.980
it in agriculture we have done lots of

24:08.030 --> 24:11.990
research myself you have somebody here

24:09.980 --> 24:15.050
an expert on agriculture

24:11.990 --> 24:17.600
he is also done lot of research and we

24:15.050 --> 24:21.110
found out that with vibrations we start

24:17.600 --> 24:24.650
after realization if you vibrate the

24:21.110 --> 24:26.960
water and if you water the plants with

24:24.650 --> 24:28.850
that then sometimes you might get even

24:26.960 --> 24:31.970
ten times more breathe that's what they

24:28.850 --> 24:34.010
did in India and one of the agricultural

24:31.970 --> 24:36.380
university but here also he's found out

24:34.010 --> 24:39.080
that this tremendous difference between

24:36.380 --> 24:40.730
the growth of an ordinary thing another

24:39.080 --> 24:44.180
thing we have found out in agriculture

24:40.730 --> 24:48.440
that if you get vibrations then even an

24:44.180 --> 24:50.690
ordinary cow can give lot of milk but if

24:48.440 --> 24:52.310
you have hybrid cows then you see they

24:50.690 --> 24:55.580
it's not good for the brain because a

24:52.310 --> 24:57.770
person who takes hybrid make also gets

24:55.580 --> 25:00.620
hybrid and his brain becomes little

24:57.770 --> 25:03.980
wobbly so better to have a pure milk

25:00.620 --> 25:06.470
from a cow which is not being put to

25:03.980 --> 25:09.020
this kind of him experimentation

25:06.470 --> 25:11.000
moreover food also if it's hybrid food

25:09.020 --> 25:13.940
is not very good for us because that

25:11.000 --> 25:15.920
spoils our nerves I think but ordinary

25:13.940 --> 25:18.370
seats you cannot choose because they

25:15.920 --> 25:22.340
have weakened and they cannot reproduce

25:18.370 --> 25:23.420
so when we vibrate them they produce

25:22.340 --> 25:25.880
very well

25:23.420 --> 25:28.790
just like better than even sometimes

25:25.880 --> 25:30.350
hybrid things and the food is taste very

25:28.790 --> 25:32.510
well and he doesn't give those

25:30.350 --> 25:35.510
complications so this can help in

25:32.510 --> 25:37.700
agriculture in India and the government

25:35.510 --> 25:40.160
has allotted a lot of land where we are

25:37.700 --> 25:42.230
going to now experiment and we are going

25:40.160 --> 25:44.720
to start the experimentation there to

25:42.230 --> 25:46.760
show that how we can use this

25:44.720 --> 25:49.240
but many farmers who are sahaja Yogi's

25:46.760 --> 25:53.590
have done a lot of job and they have

25:49.240 --> 25:55.970
discovered that even animals and this

25:53.590 --> 25:57.940
what you call farming

25:55.970 --> 26:00.120
everything is help very much my

25:57.940 --> 26:12.429
vibration

26:00.120 --> 26:14.490
[Music]

26:12.429 --> 26:14.490
you

26:14.580 --> 26:23.070
what do you think of the important

26:16.440 --> 26:25.769
points in the education of children she

26:23.070 --> 26:27.390
first if they if they get realization to

26:25.769 --> 26:29.640
get trust them to that point of

26:27.390 --> 26:31.380
realization if they're already born

26:29.640 --> 26:34.110
realized no problem but if they have

26:31.380 --> 26:36.029
their given realization then you see

26:34.110 --> 26:38.039
they start seeing from a different level

26:36.029 --> 26:43.350
they become the spirit so their self

26:38.039 --> 26:45.870
respect to see awaken so children behave

26:43.350 --> 26:48.690
in a very dignified elderly man are you

26:45.870 --> 26:51.000
see they talk in a very elderly manner

26:48.690 --> 26:54.120
and this gives solutions of all kinds

26:51.000 --> 26:56.940
you see and there are tremendous people

26:54.120 --> 26:59.880
but we have to guide them properly by

26:56.940 --> 27:02.220
our own behavior how we behave the

26:59.880 --> 27:05.480
greatest thing is how we behave that's

27:02.220 --> 27:10.740
how the children run we put the children

27:05.480 --> 27:12.330
certain to some tests how they are we

27:10.740 --> 27:14.760
find out if they have any physical

27:12.330 --> 27:17.130
problems we cure them with a mental

27:14.760 --> 27:20.039
problem we cure them if they have any

27:17.130 --> 27:22.289
other problem social problem or anything

27:20.039 --> 27:24.899
we try to help them out so that

27:22.289 --> 27:27.870
basically if a human being is all right

27:24.899 --> 27:29.549
in the childhood then fundamentals are

27:27.870 --> 27:31.769
all right for the child the foundation

27:29.549 --> 27:35.100
is laid down then to build that child up

27:31.769 --> 27:38.279
into a good quality is not difficult so

27:35.100 --> 27:41.610
now we find like a great artist on there

27:38.279 --> 27:43.260
there are three positions and at a very

27:41.610 --> 27:45.330
young age they have started being well

27:43.260 --> 27:47.549
why lean I mean suddenly they have

27:45.330 --> 27:49.860
become dynamic also and very humble

27:47.549 --> 27:52.260
they're very humble and self-respecting

27:49.860 --> 27:54.960
and very well-behaved it's surprising

27:52.260 --> 27:57.419
how atmosphere is and how it works out

27:54.960 --> 28:00.149
and the other day the lady asked me

27:57.419 --> 28:02.639
about the women and I told her that a

28:00.149 --> 28:04.919
woman's power as a mother is very great

28:02.639 --> 28:06.480
she felt hurt about it but I didn't mean

28:04.919 --> 28:08.610
that you should be just a mother what

28:06.480 --> 28:11.610
I'm saying she is a mother means she's

28:08.610 --> 28:14.279
compassionate she's kind she's not

28:11.610 --> 28:16.230
aggressive like man that is a very big

28:14.279 --> 28:17.850
quality that's a very big power in a

28:16.230 --> 28:19.980
woman that's what I was suggesting that

28:17.850 --> 28:22.350
that is what we have brought us not to

28:19.980 --> 28:27.760
compete with men it's madness we have to

28:22.350 --> 28:33.110
understand that life has to be

28:27.760 --> 28:35.780
in job nights be a blessing not to be a

28:33.110 --> 28:40.990
misery we create our own miseries by

28:35.780 --> 28:43.460
these false ideas by our own con

28:40.990 --> 28:46.160
confusions we have in our mind mental

28:43.460 --> 28:48.890
projections we have in our mind or our

28:46.160 --> 28:52.070
own obstinacy whatever it is all these

28:48.890 --> 28:53.480
things can be cured if you take to

28:52.070 --> 28:55.820
sahaja yoga because you've become a

28:53.480 --> 28:57.710
balanced person level-headed wise person

28:55.820 --> 29:00.320
and you become a witness the whole thing

28:57.710 --> 29:01.970
becomes like a show like a drama and you

29:00.320 --> 29:03.890
become fearless you start seeing the

29:01.970 --> 29:06.020
whole thing like a drama and this is

29:03.890 --> 29:09.590
what a human being has to achieve we

29:06.020 --> 29:11.900
talk of peace we talk of no war we talk

29:09.590 --> 29:14.360
of many things like this you see atomic

29:11.900 --> 29:16.370
bomb this that all that is not going to

29:14.360 --> 29:18.860
work out only what is going to work out

29:16.370 --> 29:20.660
is the transformation of human beings if

29:18.860 --> 29:23.480
the human beings are transformed things

29:20.660 --> 29:27.080
will work out absolutely first-class not

29:23.480 --> 29:30.230
only that but that they will enjoy the

29:27.080 --> 29:33.950
Bliss of life we are missing the point

29:30.230 --> 29:36.800
altogether this is a very important

29:33.950 --> 29:38.720
thing that human beings must say one

29:36.800 --> 29:43.360
thing what have you achieved out of all

29:38.720 --> 29:56.490
this just for a minute to stop and think

29:43.360 --> 29:59.800
[Music]

29:56.490 --> 30:02.410
or illnesses are caused by the

29:59.800 --> 30:04.990
imbalances in within us by our extreme

30:02.410 --> 30:07.810
behavior and supposing say now the

30:04.990 --> 30:11.440
cancer we can take the cancer is cancer

30:07.810 --> 30:15.150
is caused by the over activity of the

30:11.440 --> 30:20.200
sympathetic nervous system supposing a

30:15.150 --> 30:22.960
person is a very sad person he cries and

30:20.200 --> 30:25.150
we said all the times feels guilty and

30:22.960 --> 30:27.490
thinks that he's the first person ever

30:25.150 --> 30:30.370
born he's committed so many sins and all

30:27.490 --> 30:32.710
sorts of nonsense he then he goes to the

30:30.370 --> 30:34.420
left side according to us and crosses

30:32.710 --> 30:37.210
over to the collective subconscious area

30:34.420 --> 30:41.020
and there according to us what they call

30:37.210 --> 30:42.550
as protein 58 and protein 52 doctors

30:41.020 --> 30:45.610
call it that way but we call it as the

30:42.550 --> 30:48.130
Dead Souls they existed and they catch

30:45.610 --> 30:50.800
hold of you and they trigger the cancer

30:48.130 --> 30:53.250
but supposing by any chance you can

30:50.800 --> 30:57.160
bring the attention fully away from that

30:53.250 --> 30:59.650
in the center you can get your so it is

30:57.160 --> 31:03.160
the centers within us which are subtle

30:59.650 --> 31:05.440
which are basically seven centers there

31:03.160 --> 31:07.060
are many others but basically seven if

31:05.440 --> 31:10.600
you can put them right you cannot have

31:07.060 --> 31:23.519
any sickness or illness of any kind

31:10.600 --> 31:26.259
[Music]

31:23.519 --> 31:28.899
- he was a tremendous man one has to

31:26.259 --> 31:32.169
learn a lot from him he was not taller

31:28.899 --> 31:36.039
he put it that's one thing and he was

31:32.169 --> 31:38.529
not like modern he says the politicians

31:36.039 --> 31:41.320
who say something to something no it's

31:38.529 --> 31:45.669
very outspoken and always he put himself

31:41.320 --> 31:47.909
on the testing point and he used to

31:45.669 --> 31:51.279
confess if you made mistakes immediately

31:47.909 --> 31:54.039
one very great incident I remember when

31:51.279 --> 31:57.729
I was a small child they were having a

31:54.039 --> 32:01.029
meeting together and we got stood there

31:57.729 --> 32:03.659
only sitting giving them water and

32:01.029 --> 32:07.119
things to all the people all the big

32:03.659 --> 32:09.699
people were there like Yamaha Leo was

32:07.119 --> 32:11.679
there and also Maulana Azad all these

32:09.699 --> 32:14.169
people who are sitting there no

32:11.679 --> 32:16.299
discussing something and then suddenly

32:14.169 --> 32:20.739
not when he said that now it's very late

32:16.299 --> 32:22.839
we'll have lunch air so they said yes

32:20.739 --> 32:24.609
this we'll have lunch here they had to

32:22.839 --> 32:28.449
go to the guest house which was far away

32:24.609 --> 32:31.089
so but what he asked for the mice

32:28.449 --> 32:33.339
through his wife shared one out so he

32:31.089 --> 32:35.499
got up he had a key with him he always

32:33.339 --> 32:38.859
of the storeroom you opened the store

32:35.499 --> 32:39.729
and he asked the people who were in

32:38.859 --> 32:42.789
charge of cooking

32:39.729 --> 32:45.190
to measure everything according to the

32:42.789 --> 32:48.190
people there are properly everything you

32:45.190 --> 32:50.139
see and then he when they measured it

32:48.190 --> 32:52.569
out everything was done then he put the

32:50.139 --> 32:56.739
key back and then he went inside then

32:52.569 --> 32:59.409
ask so these people said we did not know

32:56.739 --> 33:05.259
you have to take so much trouble you see

32:59.409 --> 33:08.859
too much time out fifteen minutes but

33:05.259 --> 33:11.229
still so he said what do you think this

33:08.859 --> 33:13.839
is the blood of my country I cannot

33:11.229 --> 33:16.359
allow it to be wasted see that's the

33:13.839 --> 33:18.459
sign of a person who understands the

33:16.359 --> 33:22.269
value of public money that's just

33:18.459 --> 33:25.599
ingrained in him but those who saw him

33:22.269 --> 33:28.359
also felt that look at this man who is

33:25.599 --> 33:30.369
living like a ascetic absolutely in the

33:28.359 --> 33:33.789
sense that he would not touch the public

33:30.369 --> 33:35.559
money and that is one of the key keys

33:33.789 --> 33:40.029
for all the leaders if they are

33:35.559 --> 33:42.279
absolutely about money then only people

33:40.029 --> 33:45.069
with respect otherwise there's no way

33:42.279 --> 33:47.759
out but you find these days in every

33:45.069 --> 33:51.749
country so much of corruption hypocrisy

33:47.759 --> 33:51.749
we were really shocked
