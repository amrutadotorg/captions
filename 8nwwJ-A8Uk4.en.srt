1
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:24,100
﻿I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,140
Yesterday as I told you,

3
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,860
this is the knowledge of the roots.

4
00:01:44,196 --> 00:01:46,900
We have the knowledge of the tree.

5
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,740
But if the tree grows and grows

6
00:01:55,940 --> 00:02:00,340
and does not pay attention to its roots,

7
00:02:01,869 --> 00:02:06,877
then there is always

8
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:13,340
a definite stage where the tree gets destroyed.

9
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:27,467
So the destruction is not going to come to us

10
00:02:27,702 --> 00:02:29,702
from outside.

11
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:33,580
It is going to work out from within ourselves.

12
00:02:39,788 --> 00:02:42,149
Through various diseases,

13
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,982
through various mishaps in our lives.

14
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:57,946
It is important to see

15
00:02:58,146 --> 00:03:00,945
that you become the Spirit

16
00:03:01,146 --> 00:03:04,474
so that you will understand the mysteries of life.

17
00:03:13,453 --> 00:03:16,001
Even in the medical science

18
00:03:16,202 --> 00:03:19,780
there are many things which cannot be explained by them.

19
00:03:25,219 --> 00:03:27,300
Or in any science

20
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,100
whatever theories are propounded are all the time challenged.

21
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,311
They are not absolute.

22
00:03:39,605 --> 00:03:43,100
So there is something lacking in human awareness

23
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,441
that we are not at an absolute point.

24
00:03:51,697 --> 00:03:56,020
Now this beautiful arrangement is made within ourselves

25
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:59,100
during our evolutionary process.

26
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:09,148
But when we go to the left or to the right,

27
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:12,796
to the extremes, then what happens,

28
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:16,300
is that our centers which are like this,

29
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,502
get broken,

30
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,387
and we lose the connection with the whole.

31
00:04:32,283 --> 00:04:35,100
As a result of that we develop

32
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,931
diseases which are psychosomatic, may be physical,

33
00:04:39,131 --> 00:04:41,131
may be emotional.

34
00:04:46,598 --> 00:04:48,598
But the Kundalini,

35
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:52,620
which is the vital force passes through the center

36
00:04:53,017 --> 00:04:56,740
and brings the broken centers together,

37
00:05:03,383 --> 00:05:06,500
and brings the attention in the center.

38
00:05:09,802 --> 00:05:13,440
When our attention is on the left or on the right,

39
00:05:13,641 --> 00:05:18,500
we go into different various funny experiences.

40
00:05:25,957 --> 00:05:28,889
Like when we go to the right side,

41
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:32,740
we feel as if our body is

42
00:05:33,415 --> 00:05:36,416
somewhere and we are flying in the air.

43
00:05:44,545 --> 00:05:47,629
This we call as supraconscious experiences.

44
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:53,380
People start seeing the future,

45
00:05:53,873 --> 00:05:55,873
living in the future.

46
00:05:59,328 --> 00:06:02,260
But they do not know how it happens.

47
00:06:04,808 --> 00:06:06,814
They have no control over it.

48
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,220
They have no scientific knowledge of it.

49
00:06:12,999 --> 00:06:15,900
As if we are carried away by some force.

50
00:06:19,718 --> 00:06:22,900
On the left hand side if you move too much,

51
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,489
then you develop,

52
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:29,500
of course, horrible diseases which are psychosomatic.

53
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:40,718
But also you become possessed by funny ideas

54
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,061
and you start jumping and gesticulating and

55
00:06:45,261 --> 00:06:48,292
singing in a very miserable way.

56
00:06:55,727 --> 00:07:00,817
So within us all these problems lie on the extremes of our being.

57
00:07:06,469 --> 00:07:09,097
I’ll tell you how cancer is caused.

58
00:07:12,749 --> 00:07:16,500
Supposing the person is in the center

59
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,460
there is no possibility of

60
00:07:20,128 --> 00:07:22,180
his getting into cancer.

61
00:07:28,308 --> 00:07:32,999
Supposing he goes too much to the right; he is over active, planning,

62
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:35,199
futuristic man.

63
00:07:40,909 --> 00:07:45,540
Then his chakras move outward like this.

64
00:07:49,827 --> 00:07:53,020
Then he becomes vulnerable to cancer.

65
00:07:56,735 --> 00:07:59,540
Because his connection to the mains is lost.

66
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:07,140
But now, supposing somehow or other

67
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:12,220
he goes to the left, he gets a shock or meets with an accident

68
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,900
or he meets a bad ‘guru’, he goes to the left,

69
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:24,854
or he gets mesmerized.

70
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:29,860
Then he is triggered into cancer.

71
00:08:35,236 --> 00:08:37,236
Now the doctors do say

72
00:08:37,437 --> 00:08:41,535
that cancer is caused by triggering of…

73
00:08:43,054 --> 00:08:45,557
they call it protein 52,

74
00:08:45,758 --> 00:08:49,180
protein 54, protein 58.

75
00:08:56,974 --> 00:08:59,767
52, 54, 58.

76
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,540
These are just the names given by them.

77
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:12,989
But they say that it is coming to us through the area

78
00:09:13,189 --> 00:09:16,500
which is built within us since our creation.

79
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:29,460
That means there is an area which we call in Sahaja Yoga,

80
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,211
as collective subconscious,

81
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:42,220
where everything that is dead in the atmosphere

82
00:09:42,778 --> 00:09:44,778
is stored.

83
00:09:47,926 --> 00:09:49,926
From our creation.

84
00:09:51,847 --> 00:09:54,660
And when anything from there

85
00:09:55,256 --> 00:09:57,500
comes into our attention,

86
00:09:57,779 --> 00:10:00,300
we start developing cancer;

87
00:10:07,864 --> 00:10:10,881
because you have lost connection with the whole.

88
00:10:14,124 --> 00:10:19,219
You become, the cells become on their own.

89
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:26,485
They start acting on their own.

90
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:31,380
That becomes, they become malignant.

91
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,220
Now supposing you can bring by any chance,

92
00:10:38,421 --> 00:10:40,569
this centre, again these two,

93
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:44,287
two broken chakras into one centre,

94
00:10:50,347 --> 00:10:52,347
then cancer can be cured.

95
00:10:55,051 --> 00:11:00,126
Sahaja Yoga has cured many types of cancer inclusive of blood cancer.

96
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:08,100
But it is your own power.

97
00:11:10,578 --> 00:11:15,640
It is nobody else’s power, it is your own power within you works it out.

98
00:11:20,602 --> 00:11:25,660
And it has been now proved even by doctors,

99
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:30,020
as I told you yesterday that two doctors got their Phd,

100
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:33,248
in Sahaja Yoga, from Delhi University.

101
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:44,619
There is another thing we can discuss here about

102
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:49,459
the diseases which are caused due to over activity of the mind.

103
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:59,454
Here you can see in the centre is a round portion

104
00:11:59,655 --> 00:12:02,072
which we call as the ‘Void’.

105
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:10,377
There resides the ten valences of human beings.

106
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:18,140
And if these ten valances are enlightened

107
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,426
you can never go into extremes.

108
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,705
But when you are overactive and extremely

109
00:12:31,906 --> 00:12:34,500
futuristic then,

110
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,539
there is a center there which is
called as ‘Swadishthana’, the second centre,

111
00:12:38,739 --> 00:12:41,300
has to work very hard;

112
00:12:50,261 --> 00:12:54,540
which actually looks after the aortic plexus in our stomach,

113
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,505
in our viscera, in the stomach.

114
00:13:04,134 --> 00:13:08,260
Now this chakra has one very important work to do

115
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,500
is to convert the fat of the stomach

116
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,940
for the use of the brain which is the grey cells.

117
00:13:29,954 --> 00:13:33,420
But if you think too much and too much and too much,

118
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:36,459
you need this replacement all the time.

119
00:13:40,979 --> 00:13:45,740
And this replacement is done by this chakra.

120
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:53,339
Now this chakra has also other things to be done,

121
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:55,540
like liver,

122
00:13:58,862 --> 00:14:01,744
it has to look after the spleen,

123
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:05,175
the pancreas,

124
00:14:05,825 --> 00:14:07,859
and intestines.

125
00:14:08,957 --> 00:14:12,461
Also it has to look after the kidneys

126
00:14:12,662 --> 00:14:15,640
and the lower end of the large intestines.

127
00:14:20,806 --> 00:14:25,420
So when this gets busy with transforming

128
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,329
the cells for the grey cells, fat cells into grey cells,

129
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,595
it has no time for other functions.

130
00:14:43,456 --> 00:14:46,688
As a result of that you get a very bad liver.

131
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:56,820
Your attention becomes very distorted.

132
00:15:01,599 --> 00:15:04,872
And all the time you feel uneasy.

133
00:15:10,207 --> 00:15:13,420
You don’t feel like eating your food, and even if you eat,

134
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,620
you feel like vomiting it.

135
00:15:20,302 --> 00:15:23,492
But it can go further and you might get the cirrhosis of the liver,

136
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:26,259
skin troubles all kinds of things.

137
00:15:34,033 --> 00:15:37,060
Specially, with a bad liver if you go for sun bathing,

138
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:39,460
you are sure to get skin cancer.

139
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:50,780
Too much oil and too much fatty foods

140
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,380
if you eat also you get very bad liver.

141
00:15:59,096 --> 00:16:03,460
And maybe that you become very thin with it,

142
00:16:07,025 --> 00:16:12,020
because the liver cannot consume any fats in your body.

143
00:16:16,156 --> 00:16:20,140
Then there is also the pancreas,

144
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:24,381
which is responsible for absorbing our sugar.

145
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:34,530
That also goes out of order.

146
00:16:37,349 --> 00:16:40,813
As a result of that you develop diabetes.

147
00:16:43,672 --> 00:16:47,740
In an Indian village, a villager takes so much sugar

148
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:52,278
that he says that the spoon must stand in the cup.

149
00:16:59,382 --> 00:17:02,045
But he never gets diabetes.

150
00:17:04,247 --> 00:17:07,660
Because he does not sit down and think too much.

151
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:13,737
He deals with the life as it comes to him.

152
00:17:16,248 --> 00:17:20,991
And he is above too much of thinking.

153
00:17:24,151 --> 00:17:28,501
Then the third thing that happens to you is even more serious.

154
00:17:31,569 --> 00:17:36,260
The spleen that is responsible for attending to your emergencies

155
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:40,140
produces more red blood corpuscles.

156
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:49,700
Supposing you have taken some food

157
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,450
and after that you start running immediately,

158
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:55,294
you get a pain in that area.

159
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:07,140
And that area becomes extremely sensitive.

160
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:14,660
But in modern times, we are all the time giving shocks to our spleen,

161
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,539
because our life is so hectic.

162
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:27,980
Early in the morning we read the newspapers, horrible news, one shock.

163
00:18:33,013 --> 00:18:35,429
Then we are in a hurry, we have our lunch,

164
00:18:35,629 --> 00:18:38,700
somehow our breakfast somehow,

165
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,460
get into the car, and then we see the big crowd

166
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,700
of cars and a jam.

167
00:18:52,391 --> 00:18:54,391
Comes the second shock.

168
00:18:56,294 --> 00:19:00,647
And like that, we go on shocking our system all the time.

169
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:07,660
Whatever arrogance human beings may have,

170
00:19:11,124 --> 00:19:14,060
whatever may they think of themselves,

171
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:19,848
they must know that they are made very delicately

172
00:19:22,564 --> 00:19:24,564
and very carefully.

173
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:29,205
They should not treat them like hippopotamus.

174
00:19:31,263 --> 00:19:33,263
They are human beings.

175
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:37,036
And if they start treating themselves like that,

176
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,024
they end up with horrible diseases like blood cancer.

177
00:19:47,722 --> 00:19:51,245
Then with the kidney you develop high blood pressures,

178
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,100
then kidney non-functioning,

179
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:03,292
then remove the kidney.

180
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,870
You get constipated.

181
00:20:08,586 --> 00:20:13,489
All these things come to you because of over activity of the mind.

182
00:20:17,537 --> 00:20:21,137
Actually there is no need to plan too much.

183
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:28,260
Because if you go on planning like this, it never works out.

184
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:35,972
You must keep it open to see how it works out.

185
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:44,740
I had… I was staying somewhere else, at one place,

186
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:48,100
and I had to go to some place very far away.

187
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,700
Now if I had gone all the way back,

188
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:55,432
as planned, I would have never reached you.

189
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:08,986
So I decided to come directly

190
00:21:11,733 --> 00:21:13,733
and it has worked,

191
00:21:15,349 --> 00:21:17,929
without disturbing my system.

192
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:23,597
Now we have watches in our hands, and all the time looking at the watch

193
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:26,546
and getting frightened of the time.

194
00:21:31,261 --> 00:21:33,261
We have to save time.

195
00:21:34,839 --> 00:21:36,839
But for what?

196
00:21:37,146 --> 00:21:41,380
Like somebody in India was very anxious to catch a plane

197
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:44,640
and he wouldn’t get a ticket so he was very agitated.

198
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:53,259
I said, “But what is so necessary?”

199
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:56,377
He said, “I have to go and attend a ball”.

200
00:22:01,609 --> 00:22:03,609
Waste of time.

201
00:22:04,903 --> 00:22:09,860
For that he was so much jarring his own system.

202
00:22:14,703 --> 00:22:17,060
And when you hear such people,

203
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:20,352
suddenly they collapse and die with heart.

204
00:22:25,172 --> 00:22:27,991
Because if you become too much right sided,

205
00:22:28,192 --> 00:22:31,360
the Spirit stops,

206
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:36,485
He dies, in a sense that it never dies but it sleeps off. It disappears.

207
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:45,070
Your heart becomes like a stone.

208
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:49,999
With your arrogance it is even worse.

209
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,987
And then the reflection of God is not there.

210
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,655
Such people have no compassion, no love

211
00:23:02,953 --> 00:23:04,960
and no joy.

212
00:23:07,904 --> 00:23:10,154
They are joy killers.

213
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,797
All this running about is for joy.

214
00:23:19,683 --> 00:23:22,298
But it’s a joyless pursuit.

215
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:27,401
Then comes the left sided people,

216
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,648
who indulges into nonsensical romances

217
00:23:36,717 --> 00:23:41,940
and indulge into all kinds of sufferings for nothing at all.

218
00:23:45,515 --> 00:23:49,820
Like in Paris, when I first went, 
they said, “Mother, you look such a happy person.

219
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,173
They are not going to like You.”

220
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:03,008
They think that joyous people are ignorant.

221
00:24:05,827 --> 00:24:08,565
They don’t know what is happening in this world.

222
00:24:10,435 --> 00:24:14,260
So I started My lecture with “Les Miserable”.

223
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,602
“Les Miserable”.

224
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:23,380
If you have a pub

225
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:27,220
at every fifth lamp post,

226
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:32,050
and a bad women standing at every third lamp post in Paris,

227
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,524
you are inviting trouble.

228
00:24:44,434 --> 00:24:48,860
You see a person coming out of a pub and falling off on the street,

229
00:24:49,229 --> 00:24:52,029
and you enter into the same pub.

230
00:24:58,718 --> 00:25:02,140
You see people getting into the trouble with

231
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:04,660
funny sex habits,

232
00:25:06,758 --> 00:25:09,940
but still you want to do that, yourself.

233
00:25:17,997 --> 00:25:20,639
You are not a free person at all

234
00:25:22,235 --> 00:25:24,420
and neither you are powerful.

235
00:25:26,152 --> 00:25:30,700
You get tempted all the time to the forces of your destruction.

236
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:37,500
So that you have no discretion either,

237
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:42,900
nor understanding of your glory,

238
00:25:44,847 --> 00:25:46,859
nor of your beauty,

239
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:51,583
that God had created you especially to enter into His kingdom.

240
00:25:56,897 --> 00:26:00,321
So we live in our own paradise of destruction,

241
00:26:03,704 --> 00:26:07,011
go on destroying ourselves gradually.

242
00:26:09,741 --> 00:26:12,018
Nothing gives us happiness.

243
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:15,460
We run from

244
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:20,897
place to place to find happiness and joy.

245
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,620
Ultimately, I think, people have to put electrodes in their limbic area,

246
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:31,529
to feel joy like the monkeys do.

247
00:26:38,649 --> 00:26:42,740
We don’t respect ourselves and we don’t try to understand ourselves.

248
00:26:46,717 --> 00:26:48,717
Why are we created?

249
00:26:51,145 --> 00:26:53,306
What is the purpose of our life?

250
00:26:55,211 --> 00:26:57,660
What do we have to get out of life?

251
00:27:00,225 --> 00:27:04,660
Such a ocean of joy is lying ahead

252
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:11,410
and we do not want to go to it.

253
00:27:13,696 --> 00:27:16,732
This kind of things are happening

254
00:27:17,106 --> 00:27:22,020
and that is why yesterday I told that Spanish people should now rise

255
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,432
and see and get the joy out of their lives.

256
00:27:33,956 --> 00:27:38,052
A little journey of three to four feet of the Kundalini

257
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:41,184
brings forth this joy to you.

258
00:27:50,035 --> 00:27:54,700
So I have to make a request to you.

259
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,920
As there is less time today,

260
00:27:57,121 --> 00:28:01,380
I won’t be asking for questions today.

261
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:05,900
Yesterday we spent about one and a half an hour on useless questions.

262
00:28:15,445 --> 00:28:17,820
So better get your Realization.

263
00:28:20,301 --> 00:28:23,054
You don’t have to know all these things.

264
00:28:25,509 --> 00:28:27,925
As you don’t have to know about the electricity,

265
00:28:28,125 --> 00:28:31,740
you have to just put on the switch because it is all built in.

266
00:28:36,839 --> 00:28:38,839
May God bless you all!

267
00:28:40,709 --> 00:28:44,955
I come here every year and I am sure I will come next year also.

268
00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:07,816
It is little bit cooperation you have to give Me.

269
00:29:12,237 --> 00:29:15,860
As you have seen I have taken out the shoes

270
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:19,003
because the Mother Earth helps us a lot.

271
00:29:24,605 --> 00:29:29,304
She sucks our problems much faster than we know of.

272
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,507
So, we should try to take out our shoes and put both the feet like this,

273
00:29:39,707 --> 00:29:43,555
parallel, because left and right are two different energies.

274
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:57,020
Even the other day a lady had so much objection in taking out her shoes.

275
00:30:02,579 --> 00:30:04,820
I just don’t understand.

276
00:30:07,015 --> 00:30:09,460
There are so many wrong things we are doing,

277
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:12,284
people have no objection to that.

278
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:21,372
So don’t pay attention to frivolous things.

279
00:30:24,958 --> 00:30:30,190
Now, please put your left hand towards Me like this,

280
00:30:30,391 --> 00:30:32,940
which suggests symbolically

281
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,540
that you desire to have your Realization.

282
00:30:44,414 --> 00:30:49,180
And those who do not want to have Realization should leave this hall,

283
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,665
and leave others in peace,

284
00:30:57,334 --> 00:31:00,366
because they act negatively for others.

285
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:06,876
Now please put your left hand towards Me like this,

286
00:31:10,654 --> 00:31:14,273
and put the right hand on your heart.

287
00:31:16,144 --> 00:31:19,100
As I said, in the heart resides the Spirit.

288
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,340
Then you have to put your right hand

289
00:31:25,685 --> 00:31:28,443
on the upper part your abdomen

290
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:30,644
on the left hand side.

291
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:39,747
This is the centre of your mastery.

292
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:48,214
Then you have to put your right hand in the lower part of your abdomen.

293
00:31:55,515 --> 00:31:58,900
This is the centre of

294
00:31:59,812 --> 00:32:04,776
the pure knowledge, manifesting through your central nervous system,

295
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,780
the knowledge of divine laws.

296
00:32:15,123 --> 00:32:18,940
Then again we go back in the upper part of the abdomen,

297
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,151
on the left hand side.

298
00:32:24,452 --> 00:32:26,780
Then we go again to the heart.

299
00:32:28,737 --> 00:32:31,660
Then we go, take our hand in

300
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:35,980
the corner of your neck and turn your head to the right.

301
00:32:41,093 --> 00:32:44,460
This is the center which catches when you feel guilty

302
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:47,940
and unnecessarily angry with yourself.

303
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:58,757
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

304
00:33:00,788 --> 00:33:04,460
Then we take our hand on

305
00:33:06,060 --> 00:33:10,820
top of our, I mean on our forehead across, like this,

306
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,491
and press it on both the sides.

307
00:33:18,404 --> 00:33:22,597
Now we take this hand on the backside of our head,

308
00:33:22,797 --> 00:33:25,838
and put our head on this to rest and

309
00:33:26,038 --> 00:33:29,147
put it upward like that our head.

310
00:33:34,324 --> 00:33:39,540
Now we stretch our hand like this,

311
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:42,198
and put the center of our hand,

312
00:33:42,398 --> 00:33:46,020
on top of the fontanel bone area.

313
00:33:48,255 --> 00:33:50,247
Right hand, right hand.

314
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:56,622
And now move it,

315
00:33:56,823 --> 00:33:58,823
your scalp.

316
00:34:05,013 --> 00:34:08,788
Seven times. Keep your fingers up like that.

317
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,460
Now, please close your eyes.

318
00:34:17,133 --> 00:34:21,825
I have already requested people who 
don’t want to do Sahaja Yoga, should go away.

319
00:34:22,026 --> 00:34:26,637
Please. There's not need to be so aggressive.

320
00:34:32,556 --> 00:34:34,556
Please.

321
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:39,461
Still they don’t want to go; it’s very wrong

322
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,661
and very aggressive.

323
00:34:44,531 --> 00:34:47,939
You cannot look at other people when you are not doing it.

324
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:13,090
Thank you very much.

325
00:35:27,245 --> 00:35:29,829
Now, please close your eyes.

326
00:35:32,979 --> 00:35:37,660
Don’t open your eyes. Put both the feet parallel on the Mother Earth.

327
00:35:42,856 --> 00:35:45,998
Until I tell you don’t open your eyes.

328
00:35:49,081 --> 00:35:52,235
Now please put your left hand towards Me and right hand

329
00:35:52,436 --> 00:35:54,498
on your heart.

330
00:35:58,424 --> 00:36:03,100
Now here ask Me a very fundamental question.

331
00:36:07,419 --> 00:36:11,500
You may call Me Shri Mataji or you can call Me Mother.

332
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,562
“Mother am I the Spirit?”

333
00:36:14,762 --> 00:36:17,300
Ask this question three times.

334
00:36:33,406 --> 00:36:38,300
Now, if you are the Spirit,

335
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,417
you are your master.

336
00:36:40,618 --> 00:36:45,140
So put your right hand in the upper part of your abdomen,

337
00:36:45,340 --> 00:36:48,540
the left hand side and ask another fundamental question,

338
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:52,420
“Mother am I my own master?” Ask three times.

339
00:37:08,904 --> 00:37:11,100
Now you are free people.

340
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,340
I cannot force on you anything,

341
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:17,700
leave alone the pure knowledge of the Divine.

342
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,420
So you have to ask for it.

343
00:37:30,737 --> 00:37:36,019
So please bring your right hand
in the lower part of your abdomen,

344
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,341
in the left hand side.

345
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:44,336
And now please say,

346
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:49,389
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge of the Divine”.

347
00:37:55,624 --> 00:37:57,738
Please say it six times.

348
00:37:59,351 --> 00:38:01,860
There are six petals to this center.

349
00:38:22,617 --> 00:38:27,691
Now as soon as you say these things,

350
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:30,580
your Kundalini starts moving.

351
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,340
To facilitate Her movement,

352
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:43,043
please raise your hand to the upper center,

353
00:38:43,243 --> 00:38:48,605
which is in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left hand side.

354
00:38:54,715 --> 00:38:58,180
Now, here, you have to say

355
00:38:58,991 --> 00:39:01,148
with full confidence

356
00:39:01,349 --> 00:39:04,820
to facilitate the movement of the Kundalini,

357
00:39:05,747 --> 00:39:10,432
“Mother I am my own master”. Say it ten times.

358
00:39:35,021 --> 00:39:38,500
Now you have to know the greatest truth about you

359
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:42,935
is that you are the Spirit.

360
00:39:49,247 --> 00:39:53,356
You are not this body, you are not this conditioning,

361
00:39:53,556 --> 00:39:57,100
not this ego, not this mind.

362
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:05,820
But you are the Spirit.

363
00:40:06,845 --> 00:40:10,660
So now please put your hand on your heart.

364
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:16,260
And with full confidence say,

365
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:20,340
twelve times, “Mother I am the Spirit”.

366
00:40:28,677 --> 00:40:30,831
Have full confidence.

367
00:41:03,155 --> 00:41:08,380
Now the Divine is the ocean of love

368
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:10,240
and compassion.

369
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,060
But above all It is the ocean of forgiveness.

370
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:27,841
Above all it is the forgiveness,

371
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:33,290
then you cannot make any mistakes which can’t be engulfed

372
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:37,820
by this great power of forgiveness of God.

373
00:41:43,832 --> 00:41:46,860
So please first forgive yourself.

374
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:52,961
You have to love yourself

375
00:41:53,161 --> 00:41:56,540
and you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

376
00:42:01,393 --> 00:42:06,340
Now put your hand on your shoulder

377
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:11,580
between the neck and your shoulder,

378
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:16,740
in the corner, and put your head to your right.

379
00:42:24,123 --> 00:42:26,660
Here now you have to say,

380
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:28,940
with full confidence

381
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:31,940
for sixteen times,

382
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:37,100
“Mother I am not guilty at all”.

383
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:49,500
Sixteen times.

384
00:42:51,431 --> 00:42:55,020
Now those who still want to feel guilty can punish themselves

385
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,657
by saying it 108 times.

386
00:43:34,606 --> 00:43:38,684
Now please take your hand

387
00:43:38,884 --> 00:43:41,540
on top of your forehead across

388
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:44,220
and bend your head a little.

389
00:43:50,864 --> 00:43:53,300
Here you have to say

390
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,740
from your heart,

391
00:43:57,014 --> 00:43:59,860
“Mother I forgive everyone”.

392
00:44:05,712 --> 00:44:10,140
If you say it is difficult to forgive then know that it is a myth,

393
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:13,140
whether you forgive or if you don’t forgive.

394
00:44:18,963 --> 00:44:21,380
But if you do not forgive,

395
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:24,260
then you play into wrong hands.

396
00:44:28,296 --> 00:44:31,271
Yesterday I saw many people didn’t get Realization,

397
00:44:31,471 --> 00:44:33,660
and when they came to Me and they said,

398
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:38,020
“Mother I forgive everyone”, they got it. So please do it now.

399
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,500
Forgive everything,

400
00:44:54,676 --> 00:44:56,676
everyone.

401
00:44:58,994 --> 00:45:02,740
Now, take your hand on the back side of your head

402
00:45:02,940 --> 00:45:06,968
and put back your head, resting on that hand.

403
00:45:13,396 --> 00:45:18,302
Here you have to say without feeling guilty,

404
00:45:18,806 --> 00:45:20,900
“Mother”,

405
00:45:22,285 --> 00:45:24,820
or “the Divine

406
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:28,678
if I have done any mistakes please forgive me”,

407
00:45:28,879 --> 00:45:33,240
without counting your mistakes, without feeling guilty.

408
00:45:48,984 --> 00:45:53,100
Now, stretch your hand

409
00:45:53,707 --> 00:45:55,620
straight,

410
00:45:56,585 --> 00:46:00,153
and put your centre of your palm

411
00:46:00,354 --> 00:46:02,740
on top of your head.

412
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:07,180
Bend your head, stretch your fingers

413
00:46:07,380 --> 00:46:09,340
and press your scalp,

414
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,487
move it seven times slowly.

415
00:46:24,355 --> 00:46:26,420
Bend your head please.

416
00:46:28,186 --> 00:46:31,325
Here also I cannot force you.

417
00:46:31,526 --> 00:46:33,847
So you have to say “Mother,

418
00:46:34,047 --> 00:46:37,919
please give me my Realization”, seven times.

419
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:29,620
Now, take down your hand.

420
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:34,260
Please open your eyes.

421
00:47:39,984 --> 00:47:42,780
Now put your right hand towards Me.

422
00:47:48,403 --> 00:47:50,260
Bend your head

423
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:57,580
and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

424
00:48:08,416 --> 00:48:11,979
Now take your left hand like this.

425
00:48:17,669 --> 00:48:21,460
Put your right hand on top of your head

426
00:48:25,094 --> 00:48:28,900
and see for yourself if you are feeling the cool breeze.

427
00:48:32,795 --> 00:48:34,860
Bend your head a little.

428
00:49:00,317 --> 00:49:03,677
Now, again put your right hand towards Me

429
00:49:06,739 --> 00:49:10,739
and see with your left hand if you can feel the cool breeze.

430
00:49:16,076 --> 00:49:18,460
Now raise your both the hands,

431
00:49:20,937 --> 00:49:23,747
high up. Raise your head.

432
00:49:25,179 --> 00:49:28,500
Bend it back and ask the question,

433
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,420
“Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

434
00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:41,140
“Mother is this the Brahma Shakti?”

435
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:48,099
“Mother is this the love of God?”

436
00:49:52,898 --> 00:49:55,098
Ask these questions three times.

437
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:08,157
Now, bring down your hands please.

438
00:50:09,468 --> 00:50:11,620
Watch Me without thinking.

439
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:42,700
Now those who have felt the cool breeze

440
00:50:43,733 --> 00:50:46,236
in the hands or in their heads,

441
00:50:46,436 --> 00:50:48,860
please raise both your hands.

442
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:06,100
Most of those who came two days have got it.

443
00:51:10,277 --> 00:51:12,594
Those who have come only today,

444
00:51:12,794 --> 00:51:14,794
may not have got it.

445
00:51:18,876 --> 00:51:21,693
So many of you have got your Realization.

446
00:51:24,516 --> 00:51:28,460
Now it is now like a sprouting of the seed.

447
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,940
And you have to grow.

448
00:51:36,814 --> 00:51:39,388
We have got a centre here,

449
00:51:39,658 --> 00:51:43,953
where you should meet and grow.

450
00:51:44,153 --> 00:51:47,620
Within one month’s time you will be a master.

451
00:51:58,090 --> 00:52:02,380
You know we don’t take money, so we have very humble place.

452
00:52:07,018 --> 00:52:10,259
And you have to be very humble yourself.

453
00:52:14,136 --> 00:52:16,940
And please see that you all grow.

454
00:52:21,028 --> 00:52:23,900
Some of you did not get Realization

455
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:29,580
or maybe you did not feel the cool breeze,

456
00:52:31,724 --> 00:52:34,340
but might be feeling peaceful within.

457
00:52:36,793 --> 00:52:41,900
If this centre is out of gear also you don’t feel the vibrations.

458
00:52:47,851 --> 00:52:52,260
If you have not forgiven people, also you don’t feel the vibrations.

459
00:52:57,332 --> 00:53:00,820
So you have to take it up seriously.

460
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:07,260
You are entering into a new world,

461
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:12,980
and not to be treated frivolously, childishly.

462
00:53:16,584 --> 00:53:20,801
And I am sure all of you will develop that subtlety

463
00:53:24,898 --> 00:53:27,380
and all the powers

464
00:53:28,754 --> 00:53:32,354
by which you can to do miraculous things.

465
00:53:35,398 --> 00:53:39,163
I am sorry today there is short of time, so I have to go.

466
00:53:39,363 --> 00:53:42,340
But I hope you all will look after yourself.

467
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,180
You have a very good,

468
00:53:50,538 --> 00:53:53,639
wise Sahaja Yogi here,

469
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,700
who is the leader of Spanish people.

470
00:54:02,431 --> 00:54:05,180
You don’t have to spend any money.

471
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:10,191
Only you have to pay attention to yourself

472
00:54:10,392 --> 00:54:14,992
and you have to attend the center.

473
00:54:22,293 --> 00:54:26,194
You cannot do it individually. It is a collective happening.

474
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:35,260
Like one tree is supplying sap to all the leaves.

475
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,461
The leaf that develops a bark between

476
00:54:43,661 --> 00:54:46,020
itself and the tree, falls off.

477
00:54:52,458 --> 00:54:54,844
With little patience with yourself,

478
00:54:55,044 --> 00:54:58,928
you will develop that subtle

479
00:55:00,387 --> 00:55:04,220
being within yourself, by which you will

480
00:55:04,420 --> 00:55:08,620
feel the joy of the Divine,

481
00:55:18,763 --> 00:55:20,860
which is your right,

482
00:55:21,909 --> 00:55:24,580
which you all should have.

483
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:27,330
May God bless you all.

484
00:55:33,012 --> 00:55:37,540
Only thing I have to request, that don’t talk to anyone now.

485
00:55:41,406 --> 00:55:44,580
Please go home in this silence

486
00:55:44,780 --> 00:55:47,420
and don’t discuss and argue.

487
00:55:52,706 --> 00:55:55,380
Because you lose your vibrations.

488
00:55:58,143 --> 00:56:03,300
So I have to request you not to argue it out. You cannot argue it.

489
00:56:06,206 --> 00:56:08,380
It has to work out.

490
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:13,916
Those who have not got also should not blame anyone.

491
00:56:19,537 --> 00:56:21,537
May God bless you.

492
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:30,304
Finished at ten o’clock as you said it.

493
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:39,595
Where are My shoes?
