00:04:06.559 --> 00:04:13.769
It is so great to be with you people
today on this auspicious day;

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:23.212
to be with Australians who have proved
to be very good Sahaja yogis

00:04:25.307 --> 00:04:32.536
and who have progressed in a very
speedy manner

00:04:37.036 --> 00:04:40.093
in their spiritual life.

00:04:41.927 --> 00:04:48.868
It gives me greatest pleasure to be
with my children here.

00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:05.210
As you know I have so many children
all over the world

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:13.346
apart from the ones whom I actually
physically gave birth.

00:05:13.572 --> 00:05:23.003
We have to think of all those today who
are away from us, thousands of miles,

00:05:27.604 --> 00:05:34.639
praying to God Almighty for their
spiritual ascent.

00:05:36.176 --> 00:05:40.491
One has to only pray for the spiritual
ascent.

00:05:40.692 --> 00:05:45.412
Because as you ascend you get all
the rest of it.

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:53.071
Because you do not ascend you do not
get what is needed.

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:58.520
That’s why there are problems.

00:05:59.677 --> 00:06:05.481
And even today I had to solve some
problems before I could come to puja.

00:06:06.903 --> 00:06:13.298
But if you decide that we have to ascend
spiritually within us

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.990
then everything that you have to receive,

00:06:22.191 --> 00:06:26.755
all the blessings that God wants to shower
upon you,

00:06:26.956 --> 00:06:32.645
to make you the citizen of His great
Kingdom,

00:06:35.003 --> 00:06:38.857
where you are no more judged,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.903
you are no more chastised,

00:06:48.877 --> 00:06:52.895
you are no more put to any test,

00:06:53.268 --> 00:07:04.481
of where you reside in eternal love
of God and in His glory.

00:07:09.540 --> 00:07:14.642
I could not believe about ten years back,

00:07:14.843 --> 00:07:22.936
that within ten years I’ll be able
to achieve this result.

00:07:25.724 --> 00:07:28.985
We should not judge the progress
of Sahaja Yoga

00:07:29.186 --> 00:07:35.053
in relation to other plastic gurus.

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:46.643
Even to create one saint will require
thousand lives to pass,

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:58.171
and so many have become prophets,
it is a very big thing for you.

00:07:58.372 --> 00:08:05.687
Let us forget about what dents we have
within ourselves.

00:08:08.897 --> 00:08:13.592
We have to know that we are prophets.
This assumption

00:08:15.605 --> 00:08:18.369
has to be established – that we are
prophets.

00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:25.716
If you could just assume what you are,
what you have become,

00:08:28.766 --> 00:08:33.844
you’ll emit the glory of God!

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:45.899
Like a flower when it blossoms,

00:08:47.146 --> 00:08:52.950
it has its fragrance which flows
automatically,

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:00.916
but it’s only human being who have
freedom even not to assume,

00:09:01.117 --> 00:09:06.375
to dramatise or to assume what they are.

00:09:10.036 --> 00:09:12.819
Even if they have become prophets

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:18.454
they still linger on with what they
are not, in imagination

00:09:18.655 --> 00:09:25.753
and are still frightened, are still
ego-oriented.

00:09:25.954 --> 00:09:30.396
Is falsehood. Is not your true nature.

00:09:31.398 --> 00:09:41.520
It’s like acting in a drama, becoming
the actor.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:51.792
Like somebody is acting like Shivaji,

00:09:55.326 --> 00:10:00.803
so he becomes as if he’s Shivaji.

00:10:01.004 --> 00:10:05.352
The whole lifestyle, everything changes –
he becomes like Shivaji.

00:10:05.553 --> 00:10:10.984
But the same person if he’s acting
like Hitler,

00:10:12.384 --> 00:10:17.095
he becomes like Hitler. Both are
artificial.

00:10:17.296 --> 00:10:21.480
But artificial they become.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.801
Now when you are really prophets

00:10:25.002 --> 00:10:29.769
you find it difficult to be the real person
what you are,

00:10:29.978 --> 00:10:36.616
but artificial which has gone back,
which is no more there, all finished.

00:10:36.817 --> 00:10:45.539
The sinner is dead, the egoistical
is not there,

00:10:46.582 --> 00:10:53.324
the frightened one is gone forever,
you are a prophet.

00:10:53.525 --> 00:10:59.330
Rise in the glory of that personality.

00:11:04.266 --> 00:11:12.278
People who are not prophets, who are
not Godly,

00:11:12.479 --> 00:11:18.181
who are doing anti-God activities can
assume to be prophets.

00:11:18.382 --> 00:11:20.911
But those who are really prophets

00:11:21.112 --> 00:11:25.776
do not want to assume the situation –
that they are.

00:11:25.977 --> 00:11:29.887
As soon as you assume, you become that.

00:11:30.545 --> 00:11:39.373
We must today get over this kind of a play
our mind has been doing so far.

00:11:43.342 --> 00:11:46.897
All falsehood has to drop out.

00:11:53.262 --> 00:11:55.179
Of course as I said,

00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.966
I could never have dreamt that in ten
years, I’ll achieve these results,

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:06.807
with so many devils around us
to entice you.

00:12:08.346 --> 00:12:13.150
And credit (?) must go to you people also,

00:12:14.726 --> 00:12:24.993
that despite all hurdles and problems
you had, you have ascended,

00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:35.629
ascended so far, and have become
beautiful prophets.

00:12:35.830 --> 00:12:38.484
You are so transformed

00:12:38.685 --> 00:12:44.218
that little more – just to assume what
you are,

00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:49.558
will make you feel so sweet.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:55.008
I talked to my granddaughter, elder one,

00:12:55.222 --> 00:13:03.504
and she’s just a little girl, only 11 years
of age, but she told her mother:

00:13:03.705 --> 00:13:06.336
“Now I can’t talk to Nani (Grandmother)
because She’s a Goddess.

00:13:06.537 --> 00:13:11.681
How can I talk to Her! I feel shy.”
At that age!

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.757
While in her own life as they are saying
she’s topped in all the class,

00:13:22.958 --> 00:13:30.289
she’s got the, she’s the editor
in a magazine in her school.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:35.205
She’s tremendous. And she’s so humble
that she told her mother,

00:13:35.406 --> 00:13:37.583
“I feel shy to talk to Nani, She’s
a Goddess,

00:13:37.784 --> 00:13:40.696
how can I talk to Her?”

00:13:42.556 --> 00:13:48.433
And Rustom told Me that she, there are
vibrations emitting from her.

00:13:53.853 --> 00:13:56.722
That’s how you have to grow.

00:14:05.249 --> 00:14:09.766
First of all you have to know you are
prophets

00:14:09.967 --> 00:14:17.090
and you must know that I am the Holy Ghost.
I am the Adi Shakti.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:23.417
I am the one who has come on this earth

00:14:23.664 --> 00:14:29.612
for the first time in this form to do
this tremendous task.

00:14:32.772 --> 00:14:36.773
The more you’ll understand this
the better it will be.

00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:42.316
You will change tremendously.

00:14:56.776 --> 00:15:02.978
I knew I’ll have to say that openly
one day and we have said it.

00:15:03.179 --> 00:15:09.742
But now it is you people who have
to prove it, that I’m that.

00:15:11.492 --> 00:15:18.891
Christ had disciples who were not even
realised souls

00:15:19.092 --> 00:15:22.867
and they have spread Christianity –
whatever it is.

00:15:23.068 --> 00:15:27.004
Under such circumstances that Christ
was crucified

00:15:27.205 --> 00:15:32.603
and they were left high and dry,
just twelve people struggling

00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:35.540
but they put it up.

00:15:41.718 --> 00:15:48.884
They were very humble people, their quality
was extremely humble

00:15:49.085 --> 00:15:56.029
and they knew the difference between
them and Christ and the Mother.

00:15:58.335 --> 00:16:05.381
Also they knew the difference between
them and the others

00:16:08.305 --> 00:16:18.394
and they took to lives which were pure,
illumined by the name of Christ.

00:16:18.595 --> 00:16:21.978
They were not realised souls.

00:16:25.582 --> 00:16:33.450
They cleansed themselves and kept
their lives beautiful.

00:16:35.564 --> 00:16:43.041
So Sahaja yogis can’t afford to have
these six enemies.

00:16:43.242 --> 00:16:47.647
First of all, the temper

00:16:50.104 --> 00:16:54.540
which really doesn’t behove.

00:16:54.741 --> 00:17:03.008
Compassion! Replace temper with compassion.

00:17:06.744 --> 00:17:12.269
Today is 60th birthday and we have
to just fight

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:18.338
only six enemies within ourselves.

00:17:30.556 --> 00:17:34.769
Second is which you have, most of you
have done,

00:17:34.970 --> 00:17:40.402
is to retract your attention
from perversion.

00:17:43.728 --> 00:17:50.118
Most of you have done it. Your eyes
are better now, steady.

00:17:56.357 --> 00:18:03.871
But still you are egoistical.

00:18:05.036 --> 00:18:07.256
Vanity.

00:18:16.539 --> 00:18:21.659
Still people are jealous, competitive.

00:18:29.033 --> 00:18:35.389
You still have some lurking materialism.

00:18:39.071 --> 00:18:44.898
A new thing that is coming, you are getting
attached to your families.

00:18:59.233 --> 00:19:12.435
So we have to change it now,
in a different use.

00:19:12.636 --> 00:19:18.683
Same thing can be used for doing
God’s work.

00:19:21.652 --> 00:19:27.340
They can be used as the six hands
of Sahaja yogis.

00:19:30.759 --> 00:19:39.962
The first one is the anger. You have to be
angry with yourself

00:19:40.172 --> 00:19:43.763
when you do wrong things. And not
to feel guilty

00:19:43.964 --> 00:19:48.349
but angry with yourself for doing
wrong things.

00:19:49.474 --> 00:19:54.639
Guilty is the best way never to get rid
of it.

00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:00.701
It’s like a storehouse kept for personal
archives, locked up.

00:20:02.717 --> 00:20:07.683
I have suffered a lot because of your
guilty business very much.

00:20:11.072 --> 00:20:14.586
And they come out one by one.

00:20:15.682 --> 00:20:20.489
So you have to be angry with yourself
when you feel guilty:

00:20:20.690 --> 00:20:23.504
“How can I feel guilty? Why did I do
such a thing?

00:20:23.705 --> 00:20:26.648
I’m not going to do it.”

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:33.418
So develop your anger against yourself
and not against others.

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:42.371
And anger could be reserved for the day
of war.

00:20:44.485 --> 00:20:48.113
Otherwise when the war will break out

00:20:48.314 --> 00:20:57.698
all the Arjunas will drop their weapons
and it will be said that,

00:20:57.899 --> 00:21:02.519
“Arjuna was a great warrior – till the war
started.”

00:21:06.464 --> 00:21:12.552
So we are not going to waste our energy
in warring with things

00:21:12.753 --> 00:21:19.657
which are just like shadows. Not to fight
the shadows.

00:21:26.345 --> 00:21:32.252
Sex, perversion, has to be diverted

00:21:32.453 --> 00:21:36.308
towards your family, your wife

00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:40.223
and you have to respect your chastity now,

00:21:40.424 --> 00:21:45.641
the whole thing becomes nothing but
chastity, you lead a chaste life.

00:21:45.842 --> 00:21:51.046
Not to be like a dog, but like to be like
a human being.

00:21:54.169 --> 00:21:58.680
All that attention has to become chastity
which is your power,

00:21:58.881 --> 00:22:04.774
which is your protection, which is your
connection with the Divine.

00:22:05.619 --> 00:22:08.445
Not forced chastity

00:22:10.228 --> 00:22:16.929
but a chastity of balance and
understanding.

00:22:17.407 --> 00:22:25.250
With your family, with your wife, in a very
chaste way you can live.

00:22:27.448 --> 00:22:31.808
Same with women – is more for women,
I would say.

00:22:32.009 --> 00:22:37.650
That they should not join hands with other
men who talk against your husbands,

00:22:39.237 --> 00:22:42.887
or who teach you against your husbands.

00:22:45.923 --> 00:22:49.743
All such men should be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:49.944 --> 00:22:55.009
who try to tell women against their
husbands.

00:22:55.210 --> 00:22:57.955
This is a very sanctum sanctorum place

00:22:58.156 --> 00:23:02.986
where you should not interfere against
the husband.

00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:07.205
Nobody has a right.

00:23:13.346 --> 00:23:18.875
If there is any problem you should let
me know.

00:23:23.752 --> 00:23:27.147
It’s a sign of stupidity.

00:23:37.357 --> 00:23:42.223
Then the vanity must be made into pride.

00:23:42.433 --> 00:23:46.501
You should be proud that you are
Sahaja yogis, really proud.

00:23:46.702 --> 00:23:52.214
Raise your heads with pride that we are
Sahaja yogis.

00:23:52.817 --> 00:23:58.211
Pride is never oppressive, it’s a glorious
thing to be proud.

00:23:58.412 --> 00:24:01.430
But vanity is.

00:24:03.562 --> 00:24:08.977
Actually pride is nothing but
the expression of self-esteem.

00:24:10.022 --> 00:24:17.366
Begging, borrowing, mimicry, all these
things come

00:24:17.567 --> 00:24:26.251
from the less understanding of yourself.

00:24:26.809 --> 00:24:29.124
So vanity should be the pride,

00:24:29.325 --> 00:24:33.933
and the pride should be the expression
of self-esteem.

00:24:35.081 --> 00:24:38.063
Self esteem is very different from ego.

00:24:38.264 --> 00:24:43.567
One is reality, another is complete
artificiality.

00:24:45.058 --> 00:24:49.257
Men now should behave like men and not
like women,

00:24:49.458 --> 00:24:55.083
docile, like cows to be tied with a rope

00:24:55.284 --> 00:24:59.322
whenever their women want them to.

00:25:06.714 --> 00:25:10.249
They have to lead the society.

00:25:16.351 --> 00:25:19.264
For the women’s rights in India, the women
never fought:

00:25:19.465 --> 00:25:23.311
is the men. They never fought;

00:25:23.512 --> 00:25:29.772
is the men, because men are also
the fathers, the brothers,

00:25:29.973 --> 00:25:33.956
and they are concerned about the well-being
of women.

00:25:34.947 --> 00:25:39.049
Women seldom fought there because
they knew once they start politics

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.115
of this fighting with men, there’s no end
to it.

00:25:42.316 --> 00:25:44.514
This is basically, they knew they have
to live with men,

00:25:44.715 --> 00:25:49.229
they can’t fight them. But men themselves
fought;

00:25:49.430 --> 00:25:51.571
even in America it was Abraham Lincoln
who fought

00:25:51.772 --> 00:25:57.314
for the liberation of women, not women.

00:26:06.515 --> 00:26:16.839
So you have to be not egoistical,
but proud.

00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.144
Proud that you are Sahaja yogis, proud that
you are born in such a time

00:26:21.345 --> 00:26:26.194
when you have to carry on the duties
of God’s work.

00:26:26.395 --> 00:26:34.026
That God has chosen you! So that you
should come up to that level.

00:26:34.391 --> 00:26:37.134
Like some people I find suddenly become

00:26:37.335 --> 00:26:40.449
morose recluses, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:40.650 --> 00:26:45.808
They will never be forgiven because God
has given you so much.

00:26:46.438 --> 00:26:49.377
Supposing somebody gives you a diamond.
You are proud,

00:26:49.578 --> 00:26:54.990
you put it on and show-off. But when you
have been given your Spirit

00:26:55.191 --> 00:26:59.116
you should be proud and not to behave
like recluses.

00:26:59.317 --> 00:27:03.747
Some people feel, “I should not take
any job now.

00:27:03.948 --> 00:27:06.421
I’ll not go out, I’ll sit at home and
meditate.”

00:27:06.603 --> 00:27:10.580
There’s no place for such people
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:11.690 --> 00:27:16.973
“I can’t do this.” The word “can’t”
should go away

00:27:17.174 --> 00:27:23.094
from the dictionary of people who are
supposed to be Sahaja yogis.

00:27:23.295 --> 00:27:26.716
You just can’t say, “I can’t do it.”

00:27:33.625 --> 00:27:37.632
So the self-esteem will give you

00:27:37.833 --> 00:27:40.515
that kind of a dynamism which is needed
for Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:40.716 --> 00:27:45.600
a discreet dynamism, a wise dynamism.

00:27:47.416 --> 00:27:51.319
I won’t have to solve your problems
any more.

00:27:55.664 --> 00:28:00.330
The quality of competition and jealousy

00:28:04.540 --> 00:28:07.266
should be brought round.

00:28:09.104 --> 00:28:11.700
There should be competition between
yourself,

00:28:11.901 --> 00:28:16.283
the one what you were and what you are.

00:28:17.556 --> 00:28:22.847
Who wins? Whether your past or present?

00:28:28.299 --> 00:28:31.809
Your present should go fast, faster
and faster,

00:28:32.010 --> 00:28:37.107
leaving this past behind as much as
you can.

00:28:39.159 --> 00:28:44.757
There should be no competition between
Sahaja yogis in acquisition.

00:28:44.958 --> 00:28:49.535
Sometimes I have seen also competition
in shouting, screaming

00:28:49.736 --> 00:28:54.999
and being harsh to others – there’s
a big competition on.

00:28:56.602 --> 00:29:03.207
Let us have competition in compassion,
in mildness, in sweetness,

00:29:05.699 --> 00:29:12.081
in beautiful behaviour.

00:29:12.303 --> 00:29:18.687
Who is more cultured, who is more
gentlemanly, who is deeper;

00:29:18.888 --> 00:29:23.026
keep somebody an ideal before you
like that,

00:29:23.227 --> 00:29:31.537
whom you think is a very gentlemanly person
or a lady who is really like a lady.

00:29:33.341 --> 00:29:41.833
But on the contrary if you have a lady
who behaves like a man as your ideal,

00:29:42.034 --> 00:29:45.088
that is also not alright.

00:29:50.767 --> 00:29:56.257
Or a man who behaves like a woman,
that’s also not ideal.

00:29:56.458 --> 00:29:59.065
Or the other way round.

00:29:59.266 --> 00:30:02.589
A woman who tries to show that women
are different from men

00:30:02.790 --> 00:30:04.291
and women must get this…

00:30:04.492 --> 00:30:07.329
In Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like
women and men,

00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:09.646
that women must get this and men
must get that.

00:30:09.847 --> 00:30:14.041
Because you are Spirit. But the cover
that you have,

00:30:14.242 --> 00:30:19.012
the body that you have, the light you have,
the lamp that you have,

00:30:19.213 --> 00:30:22.759
is a different thing, and to keep
the light on,

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:27.216
a woman has to be a woman and man
has to be a man.

00:30:27.462 --> 00:30:31.760
As yesterday I told you, that an apple
should not try

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:36.106
to be a mango and mango should not try
to be an apple.

00:30:40.390 --> 00:30:46.592
It looks nice to be the best apple and
looks nice to be the best mango.

00:30:46.793 --> 00:30:50.919
So the recluses, those who say, that you
have to get out of it,

00:30:51.119 --> 00:30:54.795
behave really not like human beings
but I think like –

00:30:54.996 --> 00:30:59.691
I don’t know what animals do that way.

00:31:01.863 --> 00:31:07.577
Like when you get your doles you cannot
become indolent, you cannot.

00:31:07.778 --> 00:31:12.876
As far as possible I don’t like people
taking doles.

00:31:13.169 --> 00:31:15.158
Not a sign of good Sahaja yogis.

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:17.716
You all should be hard working, you must
have qualifications,

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:22.640
you should be good people on top
of everything.

00:31:23.564 --> 00:31:30.710
Good students, good cooks, good mothers,
good fathers,

00:31:30.911 --> 00:31:36.420
good administrators – from where are we
going to get these people?

00:31:38.937 --> 00:31:42.625
We cannot be dishwashers, can we?

00:31:49.178 --> 00:31:53.619
So the competition between women and men
must be stopped.

00:31:53.820 --> 00:31:56.780
Women must have their own place and men
must have their own place.

00:31:56.981 --> 00:32:00.641
And women must know that men are
their hands.

00:32:00.842 --> 00:32:02.976
If you are the shakti, they are
the machines

00:32:03.177 --> 00:32:05.275
and don’t kill your machines by shouting
at them,

00:32:05.476 --> 00:32:11.150
by screaming at them and by putting them
down, making them diffident.

00:32:11.351 --> 00:32:14.301
We’ll have no place.

00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:25.427
We have to encourage them to do God’s work.

00:32:25.628 --> 00:32:28.870
You have to support them, look after them,
because they are the machines,

00:32:29.071 --> 00:32:34.613
they are the hands and you are the power.

00:32:42.709 --> 00:32:50.758
Of course if these hands go against
the power they will suffer.

00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:57.429
So there should be no competition between
children and you –

00:32:57.630 --> 00:33:01.389
my child, and his child, there should be
not such competition,

00:33:01.590 --> 00:33:05.747
take out your mind from there. There should
be complete sharing.

00:33:05.948 --> 00:33:08.777
So the competition should end in sharing.

00:33:08.978 --> 00:33:13.739
How much we share? How much can we share?

00:33:14.791 --> 00:33:21.854
See drunkards can’t sit and drink alone.
They have to have some people to share.

00:33:23.754 --> 00:33:27.749
The thieves must have ten people to thieve.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.718
But when it comes to the nectar
of God’s love

00:33:33.919 --> 00:33:40.025
how can we alone have it? Cannot enjoy.
There’s no enjoyment at all in it.

00:33:40.226 --> 00:33:44.734
So let us be gentle and kind with
each other.

00:33:52.233 --> 00:33:56.692
The people who are going to enjoy
the nectar

00:33:57.655 --> 00:34:00.793
should have competition in sharing
that nectar

00:34:01.003 --> 00:34:04.743
by which they get more and more of that.

00:34:04.944 --> 00:34:09.458
Who shares more? Who is more generous?

00:34:14.350 --> 00:34:18.938
Materialism should be taken to its beauty.

00:34:22.411 --> 00:34:26.350
You can have one thing done with your hand.

00:34:29.145 --> 00:34:35.105
That’s much more beautiful than running
after money, counting money,

00:34:35.306 --> 00:34:39.579
you’ll become crackpots really.

00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:44.880
Those who count their money morning
till evening are real crackpots.

00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:50.165
They always lose money, there’s something
wrong with their brains.

00:34:51.553 --> 00:34:54.602
Count your blessings.

00:35:00.816 --> 00:35:07.682
See life, the beauty in matter.
How life has worked.

00:35:07.883 --> 00:35:14.501
See a wood, I see, I see the pattern
it has created on that, the life.

00:35:14.702 --> 00:35:25.683
But it’s not morose, it’s not dead,
it’s not insipid, it’s bubbling.

00:35:30.958 --> 00:35:36.476
You can see in art, you can see in all
that is beautiful,

00:35:36.677 --> 00:35:41.338
the reflection of God’s creative power

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:44.431
and the joy that He wanted to emit
for your happiness.

00:35:44.632 --> 00:35:46.302
While you become slaves of matter.

00:35:46.503 --> 00:35:51.075
He never wanted you to do that.
You are the masters.

00:35:53.441 --> 00:35:58.965
Last of all is the attachment to your
children,

00:35:59.821 --> 00:36:04.641
to your wife, your, your, your…

00:36:04.842 --> 00:36:13.093
Whatever is mine is not ‘I’. My house,
that’s not ‘I’.

00:36:13.570 --> 00:36:19.883
My this, my, my, my, must be given up,
‘Mamatva’ is to be destroyed.

00:36:21.588 --> 00:36:26.760
Instead of that, you should say ‘we’.
‘We’ is a good word.

00:36:26.961 --> 00:36:32.190
I so many times say ‘we’. And then people
start wondering...

00:36:32.391 --> 00:36:37.376
One day, somebody asked me, “Mother,
when you say ‘we’, what do you mean?

00:36:37.577 --> 00:36:44.500
How can you make us feel that way, that we
are all one, the way you say ‘we’?”

00:36:44.701 --> 00:36:51.060
I said, “Why not? You are part and parcel
of My body. Aren’t we ‘we’?”

00:36:51.261 --> 00:36:56.375
Do I separate My finger from My heart?

00:36:57.665 --> 00:37:03.521
If you are part and parcel of My body
then I have to talk like ‘we’

00:37:03.722 --> 00:37:09.134
because I’m conscious of this collective
being sitting here.

00:37:10.683 --> 00:37:17.373
So we have to talk like ‘we’ and not
‘I, my’.

00:37:19.757 --> 00:37:26.199
And when you have to address about yourself
speak it in a third person.

00:37:26.957 --> 00:37:33.628
Like you can say: “This Nirmala is now
going to London.”

00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:40.920
Really, is true, because this body’s going
there but My heart is going to remain here.

00:37:43.491 --> 00:37:52.107
So to say that I am going is not true –
if I am Adi Shakti where am I going?

00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:56.513
I’m going nowhere, I’m everywhere.
Where can I go?

00:37:56.714 --> 00:38:01.570
There’s no place where I don’t reside
and if I have to go to such a place,

00:38:01.771 --> 00:38:05.835
it’s Hell only where I don’t want to go.

00:38:09.656 --> 00:38:16.369
So, what I say that, “This Nirmala
is going now.

00:38:17.808 --> 00:38:23.723
Leaving Australia.” Tomorrow I’ll be
leaving.

00:38:23.924 --> 00:38:27.511
So what happens?

00:38:29.684 --> 00:38:36.578
Just this body has to move – that’s all.

00:38:36.779 --> 00:38:43.527
Like that, you start saying about your
body.

00:38:43.728 --> 00:38:48.705
“This mind of mine, this mind of Mr.
So and So.”

00:38:48.906 --> 00:38:53.779
Is better to address yourself as Mr.
or Mrs. or Miss.

00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:58.961
“So Miss, will you please get up now?”
Better address yourself.

00:38:59.162 --> 00:39:04.183
Children talk like that. Like a third
person.

00:39:04.384 --> 00:39:11.378
You’ll be amazed, you will see the joke
behind the whole thing.

00:39:11.579 --> 00:39:13.760
You’ll know how to laugh at yourself.

00:39:13.961 --> 00:39:19.447
“Oh so Mr., come along, now he’s behaving
like this.”

00:39:20.885 --> 00:39:23.396
And you’ll really become a master
of yourself,

00:39:23.597 --> 00:39:27.637
because you know how to handle this baby.

00:39:34.947 --> 00:39:38.820
It will give you that sense of maturity.

00:39:44.039 --> 00:39:47.596
So to say, “This is my child, this is
my wife”;

00:39:47.797 --> 00:39:50.141
of course, you have to look after your wife
and your children

00:39:50.342 --> 00:39:54.088
because they’re your responsibility

00:39:54.289 --> 00:39:59.774
but do for other children more than you
would like to do for your own child.

00:40:00.747 --> 00:40:03.938
(There is somebody who has come.)

00:40:27.641 --> 00:40:35.740
So this complete identification with your
children, over protectiveness,

00:40:35.941 --> 00:40:39.699
will give you trouble. You have to believe

00:40:39.900 --> 00:40:49.408
that your family is the family of your
Father,

00:40:51.143 --> 00:40:54.776
and your Mother is looking after it.

00:40:54.977 --> 00:41:00.443
If you think you can look after your family
by yourself – go ahead!

00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:08.904
So don’t be overprotective, don’t be too
worried, too upset about your family.

00:41:11.831 --> 00:41:17.037
And keep a very sociable temperament

00:41:17.238 --> 00:41:21.745
so that your children also don’t become
like you.

00:41:21.946 --> 00:41:24.778
Tell them how to share.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:30.968
If one child has fallen off ask other
children to help.

00:41:31.169 --> 00:41:33.906
Form plays in which you should show,

00:41:34.107 --> 00:41:38.578
how a child who is coming, who cannot
walk properly,

00:41:38.779 --> 00:41:44.191
how other children go and try and find out
methods how to help him to come out.

00:41:44.382 --> 00:41:50.983
Teach them, through dramas, through
stories, through various things,

00:41:51.184 --> 00:41:54.611
what is goodness.

00:41:55.536 --> 00:41:58.783
You must help even without the idea
of help.

00:41:58.984 --> 00:42:07.719
It’s a pleasure, it’s a privilege.
It’s a great honour that you can do it.

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:12.058
We must change our ideas completely.

00:42:12.383 --> 00:42:14.800
Many people have a habit to serve
‘your’ child first –

00:42:15.001 --> 00:42:20.932
is absolutely very vulgar, shows bad
breeding.

00:42:21.227 --> 00:42:25.857
Must serve others first, and then your
own family.

00:42:28.332 --> 00:42:32.939
Keeping something back for your children,
hiding some food for your children –

00:42:33.140 --> 00:42:39.155
is all a sign of a person who is like
a ‘kupamanduka’,

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:45.576
means ‘a frog who lives in a small well’.

00:42:47.615 --> 00:42:49.931
Get over it.

00:42:52.087 --> 00:42:56.969
Try, men to form your own group of men

00:42:57.170 --> 00:43:01.098
and women should form their group of women.

00:43:01.299 --> 00:43:09.849
There should be no instruction to women
from men too much. Is not proper.

00:43:10.481 --> 00:43:14.119
I have discovered so many funny things,

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:19.508
I can’t understand, how these things
work out.

00:43:19.709 --> 00:43:26.018
But, it is because one side you feel your
family is too much,

00:43:26.219 --> 00:43:33.062
your husband is too much, you must be
absolutely secluded from all the rest,

00:43:33.263 --> 00:43:37.280
or on the other side it is that you give up
your husband completely -

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:41.642
he is no good, the marriage is
unsuccessful, stick on to something else

00:43:41.843 --> 00:43:47.492
which is supposed to be a something,
higher goal of destruction.

00:43:48.027 --> 00:43:51.661
So both things are not good.

00:43:53.616 --> 00:44:00.825
You must stand for your husband or wife
or for your children, when it is right.

00:44:01.026 --> 00:44:04.388
But obviously you should not do it,
apparently you should not do it.

00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:06.832
You should tell your child, “Alright,
I understand,

00:44:07.033 --> 00:44:10.874
but I don’t want to do it in the public.”

00:44:11.976 --> 00:44:15.163
People should not also know that he’s
your child.

00:44:15.364 --> 00:44:18.500
The way he mixes up with others, stays
with others,

00:44:18.701 --> 00:44:23.007
shares with others, that’s how a Sahaja
yogi should be.

00:44:26.637 --> 00:44:28.238
You know as for myself,

00:44:28.439 --> 00:44:33.740
I’ve not even given realisation
to my children so far.

00:44:35.047 --> 00:44:42.017
Can you believe it? Leave alone the
knowledge of Kundalini. You can teach them.

00:44:43.137 --> 00:44:47.071
I know I can give them any time I want to.

00:44:51.222 --> 00:44:55.384
I have not given them time at all,
no time to them.

00:44:55.585 --> 00:45:01.377
If you see, how much time do I spend with
My own daughters? Very little time.

00:45:01.578 --> 00:45:07.442
In the whole year, this year I was there
for three days with her.

00:45:09.928 --> 00:45:13.069
So the relationship at this time is
the most important,

00:45:13.270 --> 00:45:17.117
is of Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja yogis.

00:45:17.318 --> 00:45:20.716
I have seen some Sahaja yogis write
to their parents, to their mothers,

00:45:20.917 --> 00:45:26.239
to their brothers, much more than they
write to the other Sahaja yogis.

00:45:26.761 --> 00:45:29.704
Is very amazing.

00:45:31.049 --> 00:45:36.019
To their fathers but not to other
Sahaja yogis.

00:45:37.035 --> 00:45:38.834
You must start writing to other
Sahaja yogis.

00:45:39.035 --> 00:45:42.120
Those who have lived in London,
how many of them

00:45:42.321 --> 00:45:45.193
are writing to people in London? Have
they made any friends or anything? –

00:45:45.394 --> 00:45:49.592
Nothing of the kind. They are so busy
with their own problems,

00:45:49.793 --> 00:45:58.365
they’re not bothered, to create that
bondage of love.

00:46:00.759 --> 00:46:04.092
As if they have no interest in Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:04.293 --> 00:46:10.538
They stayed in the ashram, in London. How
many of you are writing letters to them?

00:46:10.768 --> 00:46:13.829
To London people. How many letters
do you write?

00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:16.519
Now you have met them in this programme,

00:46:16.720 --> 00:46:20.288
how many of you are writing letters
to them and keep in contact?

00:46:20.489 --> 00:46:24.663
How much does it take to write a letter?
Nothing.

00:46:28.082 --> 00:46:31.550
I hope as soon as you go back today you
all should write letters

00:46:31.751 --> 00:46:36.447
about today’s Birthday – how it was
celebrated, in a beautiful way.

00:46:36.648 --> 00:46:43.403
Not to your family, not to your people,
but to others.

00:46:43.604 --> 00:46:46.708
All of them are all over, you know how
they are.

00:46:46.909 --> 00:46:50.386
You write to them because you know
they are the heads of the thing.

00:46:50.587 --> 00:46:57.394
Like if you write to Gregoire or you can
write to Ruth in Italy,

00:46:57.595 --> 00:47:03.918
you can write to Genevieve in Geneva.

00:47:04.291 --> 00:47:08.326
You have met all of them – you should
write!

00:47:10.297 --> 00:47:13.996
Ladies must write to ladies and men must
write to men.

00:47:14.197 --> 00:47:18.149
Arneau is in Lausanne: why not write
to him?

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:23.739
He’s there; now do you know that his wife
has to go to America for a delivery?

00:47:23.940 --> 00:47:26.099
We should know about each other,
very intimately.

00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:32.131
About how many people I know so many
things, all the details.

00:47:37.649 --> 00:47:42.518
That’s how; you must flood yourself
with that love.

00:47:42.719 --> 00:47:47.639
Tomorrow you go to America or to any
one of these places,

00:47:47.840 --> 00:47:52.407
you have there your brothers and sisters
already established.

00:47:53.035 --> 00:47:56.919
Write to them about your Mother,
what you think.

00:47:58.313 --> 00:48:03.529
You only write to Me sometimes but never
to each other.

00:48:05.588 --> 00:48:10.823
Don’t write too big letters to Me
especially.

00:48:13.592 --> 00:48:17.839
But write nice, sweet letters, poetic
letters,

00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:21.930
they’ll feel happy, it’s like sending
flowers.

00:48:23.758 --> 00:48:29.153
Taking ideas from there it will be
a very good idea.

00:48:29.354 --> 00:48:31.797
(What’s the matter?)

00:48:44.631 --> 00:48:52.197
This will overcome these six enemies
and make them your slaves

00:48:52.398 --> 00:48:56.309
and use them for your purpose.

00:48:56.684 --> 00:49:02.805
Then they’ll become great things.
Then they’ll be your assistants,

00:49:04.453 --> 00:49:15.677
then they wlll be your commanders of your
army, they’ll be your decorations.

00:49:17.565 --> 00:49:22.667
It is all in your hands. With wisdom,
you have to do it.

00:49:24.526 --> 00:49:30.400
At this time, at the age where I’ve
reached –

00:49:34.995 --> 00:49:39.203
I was always there, same age,

00:49:40.271 --> 00:49:45.011
I’ve been always mature like this,
child like this,

00:49:46.068 --> 00:49:52.077
just like a young girl and an old woman,
all put together,

00:49:52.278 --> 00:49:55.610
every year, every time.

00:49:55.986 --> 00:50:00.297
But I’ve definitely matured in understanding
human beings.

00:50:03.851 --> 00:50:06.989
I’ve definitely got better understanding
and maturity

00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:11.532
as far as My knowledge about human beings
are concerned because they are...

00:50:11.733 --> 00:50:14.553
When I was born they were strangers
to Me – just strangers.

00:50:14.754 --> 00:50:18.598
Imagine that Adi Shakti should say this,
but it’s true!

00:50:18.799 --> 00:50:26.490
Despite I have created you, I was
absolutely a stranger.

00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:35.190
But now, I’ve grown, I’ve understood you
very well,

00:50:37.489 --> 00:50:43.875
I know you are My children, I know how much
you love Me

00:50:44.506 --> 00:50:47.099
and how much you are close to Me.

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:50.896
[Shri Mataji: Why is he crying so much?
Yogi: He wants to go to the toilet, Mother.

00:50:51.097 --> 00:50:53.894
Shri Mataji: Let him take away.
Yogi: He wants me to go with him

00:50:54.095 --> 00:50:57.409
but I’m trying to say he can go himself,
but...

00:50:57.630 --> 00:50:59.371
Shri Mataji: Let him go, this is the thing,
you see,

00:50:59.572 --> 00:51:01.375
these children are very obstinate,
I personally think.

00:51:01.576 --> 00:51:04.169
Yogi: Yeah. He wants me to go with him.
That’s the thing, that’s why.

00:51:04.370 --> 00:51:06.011
Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s bhootish,
isn’t it?

00:51:06.212 --> 00:51:08.964
Yogi: Yes, that’s what I’m saying.
Shri Mataji: We can think - let him go.

00:51:09.165 --> 00:51:12.036
He won’t listen.

00:51:12.546 --> 00:51:16.701
Better go. See.

00:51:21.436 --> 00:51:23.346
All right, take him down.

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:28.231
What to do, you see, they are very
obstinate. They are bhoots.

00:51:28.448 --> 00:51:32.282
Such a big boy can’t go to the toilet?
Yogi: Yes...

00:51:38.980 --> 00:51:42.429
Shri Mataji: Just to disturb him,
that’s all.

00:51:46.150 --> 00:51:48.824
May God bless you.

00:51:51.087 --> 00:51:52.595
You must really slap him now,

00:51:52.796 --> 00:51:56.179
if you give two slaps now, his bhoot
will go away.

00:51:56.379 --> 00:51:58.478
Two slaps are needed. Next time
he won’t do it.

00:51:58.680 --> 00:52:00.860
You see at this time you must slap,

00:52:01.061 --> 00:52:05.404
not very hard but let him know that
you don’t like it.

00:52:09.204 --> 00:52:11.688
Bhoots can sometimes can go away
only with slapping.

00:52:11.889 --> 00:52:14.808
I have seen especially with children
it happens.

00:52:15.009 --> 00:52:17.897
Two slaps on the face and they’re alright.

00:52:18.098 --> 00:52:21.850
Because they’re bhoots, you see, and they
have to go away.]

00:52:23.657 --> 00:52:28.371
Now whatever I have said to you yesterday
for children be careful.

00:52:28.572 --> 00:52:35.891
You have to make your children assets
and not liabilities, on Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:42.628 --> 00:52:45.232
So try to train them up properly.

00:52:45.433 --> 00:52:50.895
Bring them up, they deserve a good hand,
to handle.

00:52:51.312 --> 00:52:55.595
In the beginning you have to be very strict
and punish them if they do anything wrong,

00:52:55.796 --> 00:52:59.422
so they know what is right, what is wrong.

00:53:01.751 --> 00:53:06.581
And once they grow up you’ll be amazed
what an asset they are.

00:53:09.937 --> 00:53:13.340
Some of them are very good children

00:53:13.804 --> 00:53:17.161
but if the influence of the bad children
comes up too much,

00:53:17.362 --> 00:53:20.589
they might spoil the good children also.

00:53:20.790 --> 00:53:27.386
So better encourage children, who are good,
who have been very sweet.

00:53:29.616 --> 00:53:37.750
So I think of My young age, of My childhood

00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:41.949
and the dream, how it has come true.

00:53:45.626 --> 00:53:50.944
Whatever I have dreamt, is beyond
my imagination.

00:53:53.578 --> 00:54:00.813
It’s done now, as far as I’m concerned
you don’t need Me much, any more.

00:54:01.107 --> 00:54:05.430
I’ve told you whatever was needed
for your counselling.

00:54:05.630 --> 00:54:12.593
I have taught you the methods how to redeem
others, and comfort them.

00:54:12.794 --> 00:54:18.687
You know everything. Now just become
masters in this art.

00:54:19.865 --> 00:54:27.675
Forgetting your past. You are all great
people, all of you.

00:54:28.193 --> 00:54:35.189
So, even next year, I should see you

00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:42.531
sitting on this seat, not in My lap.

00:54:45.322 --> 00:54:50.977
On your own, teaching your children.

00:54:51.599 --> 00:54:57.225
Let the second generation start now.
The first generation is ready,

00:54:57.433 --> 00:55:00.077
now the second generation has to come
and you have to look after

00:55:00.278 --> 00:55:03.299
the second generation.

00:55:04.024 --> 00:55:11.435
I want to be a real grandmother of very
grand children,

00:55:16.642 --> 00:55:21.811
that’s a special privilege and real
promotion and maturity.

00:55:24.335 --> 00:55:27.005
Look at this (rain is pouring down).

00:55:27.380 --> 00:55:31.211
He’s going to flood your Parramatta
(river in Sydney).

00:55:32.999 --> 00:55:37.692
Because I have said now I’m the Holy Ghost,

00:55:40.949 --> 00:55:45.829
everybody seems to be over-happy and
joyous.

00:55:51.605 --> 00:55:56.584
So thank you very much, for having Me here

00:55:56.785 --> 00:56:01.948
and think of all the Sahaja yogis all
around the world, all of them.

00:56:02.149 --> 00:56:06.056
Today, I think we should send some
telegrams, about twelve telegrams

00:56:06.257 --> 00:56:11.240
if possible, to all the centres, saying

00:56:11.441 --> 00:56:16.779
60th Birthday of Mother was celebrated
with great joy.

00:56:16.980 --> 00:56:21.873
She sends blessings, or something.
They’ll be very happy.

00:56:24.799 --> 00:56:29.378
But according to Indian method it is 61st

00:56:29.579 --> 00:56:33.636
because the day I was born, that was also
a birthday.

00:56:33.837 --> 00:56:38.119
That was a real birthday. So they
call it 61,

00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:42.791
and we are going to have a big programme
in India also.

00:56:43.918 --> 00:56:49.872
You are specially favoured people,

00:56:50.073 --> 00:56:53.583
and I hope you’ll favour Me specially too.

00:56:53.768 --> 00:56:59.203
This year I hope, all of you are going
to take up a new role

00:56:59.404 --> 00:57:04.290
and a new style of life where you become
mild people,

00:57:04.616 --> 00:57:11.194
not docile men but mild people and docile
women.

00:57:16.415 --> 00:57:23.962
Women have to be more docile, domesticated.

00:57:24.507 --> 00:57:27.028
They’ll look nice.

00:57:27.782 --> 00:57:35.656
They’ll become gentle, they’ll smile
better, they(’ll) create such joy.

00:57:36.495 --> 00:57:42.136
We are here to create joy and not to enjoy
some rights, which are artificial,

00:57:42.337 --> 00:57:46.336
to create joy. How much joy do we create?

00:57:47.099 --> 00:57:55.249
How much joy do we give to others?
So today on this great occasion,

00:57:56.372 --> 00:58:02.278
we have to feel our joy, within our heart.

00:58:02.479 --> 00:58:08.467
Very deep down within us lies that source
of joy.

00:58:08.668 --> 00:58:12.073
So we have to go deep down within ourselves

00:58:12.274 --> 00:58:18.978
and feel the joy of this sixty-year old
Mother of yours, that I have within Myself.

00:58:19.186 --> 00:58:24.707
Go deep down, it’s there, enjoy it and then
give it to others.

00:58:24.908 --> 00:58:28.290
Like a fountain of joy you should give.

00:58:29.917 --> 00:58:32.319
May God bless you.

00:58:37.597 --> 00:58:41.871
Declare to all the nations now,
that I am the Holy Ghost

00:58:42.080 --> 00:58:49.091
and I have come for this special time,
that is the resurrection time.
