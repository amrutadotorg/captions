WEBVTT

04:06.559 --> 04:13.769
It is so great to be with you people
today on this auspicious day;

04:14.150 --> 04:23.212
to be with Australians who have proved
to be very good Sahaja yogis

04:25.307 --> 04:32.536
and who have progressed in a very
speedy manner

04:37.036 --> 04:40.093
in their spiritual life.

04:41.927 --> 04:48.868
It gives me greatest pleasure to be
with my children here.

04:59.001 --> 05:05.210
As you know I have so many children
all over the world

05:07.550 --> 05:13.346
apart from the ones whom I actually
physically gave birth.

05:13.572 --> 05:23.003
We have to think of all those today who
are away from us, thousands of miles,

05:27.604 --> 05:34.639
praying to God Almighty for their
spiritual ascent.

05:36.176 --> 05:40.491
One has to only pray for the spiritual
ascent.

05:40.692 --> 05:45.412
Because as you ascend you get all
the rest of it.

05:46.610 --> 05:53.071
Because you do not ascend you do not
get what is needed.

05:55.466 --> 05:58.520
That’s why there are problems.

05:59.677 --> 06:05.481
And even today I had to solve some
problems before I could come to puja.

06:06.903 --> 06:13.298
But if you decide that we have to ascend
spiritually within us

06:17.060 --> 06:21.990
then everything that you have to receive,

06:22.191 --> 06:26.755
all the blessings that God wants to shower
upon you,

06:26.956 --> 06:32.645
to make you the citizen of His great
Kingdom,

06:35.003 --> 06:38.857
where you are no more judged,

06:41.490 --> 06:44.903
you are no more chastised,

06:48.877 --> 06:52.895
you are no more put to any test,

06:53.268 --> 07:04.481
of where you reside in eternal love
of God and in His glory.

07:09.540 --> 07:14.642
I could not believe about ten years back,

07:14.843 --> 07:22.936
that within ten years I’ll be able
to achieve this result.

07:25.724 --> 07:28.985
We should not judge the progress
of Sahaja Yoga

07:29.186 --> 07:35.053
in relation to other plastic gurus.

07:35.870 --> 07:46.643
Even to create one saint will require
thousand lives to pass,

07:50.580 --> 07:58.171
and so many have become prophets,
it is a very big thing for you.

07:58.372 --> 08:05.687
Let us forget about what dents we have
within ourselves.

08:08.897 --> 08:13.592
We have to know that we are prophets.
This assumption

08:15.605 --> 08:18.369
has to be established – that we are
prophets.

08:18.570 --> 08:25.716
If you could just assume what you are,
what you have become,

08:28.766 --> 08:33.844
you’ll emit the glory of God!

08:38.518 --> 08:45.899
Like a flower when it blossoms,

08:47.146 --> 08:52.950
it has its fragrance which flows
automatically,

08:54.440 --> 09:00.916
but it’s only human being who have
freedom even not to assume,

09:01.117 --> 09:06.375
to dramatise or to assume what they are.

09:10.036 --> 09:12.819
Even if they have become prophets

09:13.020 --> 09:18.454
they still linger on with what they
are not, in imagination

09:18.655 --> 09:25.753
and are still frightened, are still
ego-oriented.

09:25.954 --> 09:30.396
Is falsehood. Is not your true nature.

09:31.398 --> 09:41.520
It’s like acting in a drama, becoming
the actor.

09:45.200 --> 09:51.792
Like somebody is acting like Shivaji,

09:55.326 --> 10:00.803
so he becomes as if he’s Shivaji.

10:01.004 --> 10:05.352
The whole lifestyle, everything changes –
he becomes like Shivaji.

10:05.553 --> 10:10.984
But the same person if he’s acting
like Hitler,

10:12.384 --> 10:17.095
he becomes like Hitler. Both are
artificial.

10:17.296 --> 10:21.480
But artificial they become.

10:22.380 --> 10:24.801
Now when you are really prophets

10:25.002 --> 10:29.769
you find it difficult to be the real person
what you are,

10:29.978 --> 10:36.616
but artificial which has gone back,
which is no more there, all finished.

10:36.817 --> 10:45.539
The sinner is dead, the egoistical
is not there,

10:46.582 --> 10:53.324
the frightened one is gone forever,
you are a prophet.

10:53.525 --> 10:59.330
Rise in the glory of that personality.

11:04.266 --> 11:12.278
People who are not prophets, who are
not Godly,

11:12.479 --> 11:18.181
who are doing anti-God activities can
assume to be prophets.

11:18.382 --> 11:20.911
But those who are really prophets

11:21.112 --> 11:25.776
do not want to assume the situation –
that they are.

11:25.977 --> 11:29.887
As soon as you assume, you become that.

11:30.545 --> 11:39.373
We must today get over this kind of a play
our mind has been doing so far.

11:43.342 --> 11:46.897
All falsehood has to drop out.

11:53.262 --> 11:55.179
Of course as I said,

11:55.380 --> 12:00.966
I could never have dreamt that in ten
years, I’ll achieve these results,

12:01.270 --> 12:06.807
with so many devils around us
to entice you.

12:08.346 --> 12:13.150
And credit (?) must go to you people also,

12:14.726 --> 12:24.993
that despite all hurdles and problems
you had, you have ascended,

12:27.875 --> 12:35.629
ascended so far, and have become
beautiful prophets.

12:35.830 --> 12:38.484
You are so transformed

12:38.685 --> 12:44.218
that little more – just to assume what
you are,

12:45.321 --> 12:49.558
will make you feel so sweet.

12:50.269 --> 12:55.008
I talked to my granddaughter, elder one,

12:55.222 --> 13:03.504
and she’s just a little girl, only 11 years
of age, but she told her mother:

13:03.705 --> 13:06.336
“Now I can’t talk to Nani (Grandmother)
because She’s a Goddess.

13:06.537 --> 13:11.681
How can I talk to Her! I feel shy.”
At that age!

13:18.510 --> 13:22.757
While in her own life as they are saying
she’s topped in all the class,

13:22.958 --> 13:30.289
she’s got the, she’s the editor
in a magazine in her school.

13:31.144 --> 13:35.205
She’s tremendous. And she’s so humble
that she told her mother,

13:35.406 --> 13:37.583
“I feel shy to talk to Nani, She’s
a Goddess,

13:37.784 --> 13:40.696
how can I talk to Her?”

13:42.556 --> 13:48.433
And Rustom told Me that she, there are
vibrations emitting from her.

13:53.853 --> 13:56.722
That’s how you have to grow.

14:05.249 --> 14:09.766
First of all you have to know you are
prophets

14:09.967 --> 14:17.090
and you must know that I am the Holy Ghost.
I am the Adi Shakti.

14:18.910 --> 14:23.417
I am the one who has come on this earth

14:23.664 --> 14:29.612
for the first time in this form to do
this tremendous task.

14:32.772 --> 14:36.773
The more you’ll understand this
the better it will be.

14:37.540 --> 14:42.316
You will change tremendously.

14:56.776 --> 15:02.978
I knew I’ll have to say that openly
one day and we have said it.

15:03.179 --> 15:09.742
But now it is you people who have
to prove it, that I’m that.

15:11.492 --> 15:18.891
Christ had disciples who were not even
realised souls

15:19.092 --> 15:22.867
and they have spread Christianity –
whatever it is.

15:23.068 --> 15:27.004
Under such circumstances that Christ
was crucified

15:27.205 --> 15:32.603
and they were left high and dry,
just twelve people struggling

15:32.804 --> 15:35.540
but they put it up.

15:41.718 --> 15:48.884
They were very humble people, their quality
was extremely humble

15:49.085 --> 15:56.029
and they knew the difference between
them and Christ and the Mother.

15:58.335 --> 16:05.381
Also they knew the difference between
them and the others

16:08.305 --> 16:18.394
and they took to lives which were pure,
illumined by the name of Christ.

16:18.595 --> 16:21.978
They were not realised souls.

16:25.582 --> 16:33.450
They cleansed themselves and kept
their lives beautiful.

16:35.564 --> 16:43.041
So Sahaja yogis can’t afford to have
these six enemies.

16:43.242 --> 16:47.647
First of all, the temper

16:50.104 --> 16:54.540
which really doesn’t behove.

16:54.741 --> 17:03.008
Compassion! Replace temper with compassion.

17:06.744 --> 17:12.269
Today is 60th birthday and we have
to just fight

17:12.470 --> 17:18.338
only six enemies within ourselves.

17:30.556 --> 17:34.769
Second is which you have, most of you
have done,

17:34.970 --> 17:40.402
is to retract your attention
from perversion.

17:43.728 --> 17:50.118
Most of you have done it. Your eyes
are better now, steady.

17:56.357 --> 18:03.871
But still you are egoistical.

18:05.036 --> 18:07.256
Vanity.

18:16.539 --> 18:21.659
Still people are jealous, competitive.

18:29.033 --> 18:35.389
You still have some lurking materialism.

18:39.071 --> 18:44.898
A new thing that is coming, you are getting
attached to your families.

18:59.233 --> 19:12.435
So we have to change it now,
in a different use.

19:12.636 --> 19:18.683
Same thing can be used for doing
God’s work.

19:21.652 --> 19:27.340
They can be used as the six hands
of Sahaja yogis.

19:30.759 --> 19:39.962
The first one is the anger. You have to be
angry with yourself

19:40.172 --> 19:43.763
when you do wrong things. And not
to feel guilty

19:43.964 --> 19:48.349
but angry with yourself for doing
wrong things.

19:49.474 --> 19:54.639
Guilty is the best way never to get rid
of it.

19:54.840 --> 20:00.701
It’s like a storehouse kept for personal
archives, locked up.

20:02.717 --> 20:07.683
I have suffered a lot because of your
guilty business very much.

20:11.072 --> 20:14.586
And they come out one by one.

20:15.682 --> 20:20.489
So you have to be angry with yourself
when you feel guilty:

20:20.690 --> 20:23.504
“How can I feel guilty? Why did I do
such a thing?

20:23.705 --> 20:26.648
I’m not going to do it.”

20:27.560 --> 20:33.418
So develop your anger against yourself
and not against others.

20:36.501 --> 20:42.371
And anger could be reserved for the day
of war.

20:44.485 --> 20:48.113
Otherwise when the war will break out

20:48.314 --> 20:57.698
all the Arjunas will drop their weapons
and it will be said that,

20:57.899 --> 21:02.519
“Arjuna was a great warrior – till the war
started.”

21:06.464 --> 21:12.552
So we are not going to waste our energy
in warring with things

21:12.753 --> 21:19.657
which are just like shadows. Not to fight
the shadows.

21:26.345 --> 21:32.252
Sex, perversion, has to be diverted

21:32.453 --> 21:36.308
towards your family, your wife

21:37.750 --> 21:40.223
and you have to respect your chastity now,

21:40.424 --> 21:45.641
the whole thing becomes nothing but
chastity, you lead a chaste life.

21:45.842 --> 21:51.046
Not to be like a dog, but like to be like
a human being.

21:54.169 --> 21:58.680
All that attention has to become chastity
which is your power,

21:58.881 --> 22:04.774
which is your protection, which is your
connection with the Divine.

22:05.619 --> 22:08.445
Not forced chastity

22:10.228 --> 22:16.929
but a chastity of balance and
understanding.

22:17.407 --> 22:25.250
With your family, with your wife, in a very
chaste way you can live.

22:27.448 --> 22:31.808
Same with women – is more for women,
I would say.

22:32.009 --> 22:37.650
That they should not join hands with other
men who talk against your husbands,

22:39.237 --> 22:42.887
or who teach you against your husbands.

22:45.923 --> 22:49.743
All such men should be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga,

22:49.944 --> 22:55.009
who try to tell women against their
husbands.

22:55.210 --> 22:57.955
This is a very sanctum sanctorum place

22:58.156 --> 23:02.986
where you should not interfere against
the husband.

23:04.400 --> 23:07.205
Nobody has a right.

23:13.346 --> 23:18.875
If there is any problem you should let
me know.

23:23.752 --> 23:27.147
It’s a sign of stupidity.

23:37.357 --> 23:42.223
Then the vanity must be made into pride.

23:42.433 --> 23:46.501
You should be proud that you are
Sahaja yogis, really proud.

23:46.702 --> 23:52.214
Raise your heads with pride that we are
Sahaja yogis.

23:52.817 --> 23:58.211
Pride is never oppressive, it’s a glorious
thing to be proud.

23:58.412 --> 24:01.430
But vanity is.

24:03.562 --> 24:08.977
Actually pride is nothing but
the expression of self-esteem.

24:10.022 --> 24:17.366
Begging, borrowing, mimicry, all these
things come

24:17.567 --> 24:26.251
from the less understanding of yourself.

24:26.809 --> 24:29.124
So vanity should be the pride,

24:29.325 --> 24:33.933
and the pride should be the expression
of self-esteem.

24:35.081 --> 24:38.063
Self esteem is very different from ego.

24:38.264 --> 24:43.567
One is reality, another is complete
artificiality.

24:45.058 --> 24:49.257
Men now should behave like men and not
like women,

24:49.458 --> 24:55.083
docile, like cows to be tied with a rope

24:55.284 --> 24:59.322
whenever their women want them to.

25:06.714 --> 25:10.249
They have to lead the society.

25:16.351 --> 25:19.264
For the women’s rights in India, the women
never fought:

25:19.465 --> 25:23.311
is the men. They never fought;

25:23.512 --> 25:29.772
is the men, because men are also
the fathers, the brothers,

25:29.973 --> 25:33.956
and they are concerned about the well-being
of women.

25:34.947 --> 25:39.049
Women seldom fought there because
they knew once they start politics

25:39.250 --> 25:42.115
of this fighting with men, there’s no end
to it.

25:42.316 --> 25:44.514
This is basically, they knew they have
to live with men,

25:44.715 --> 25:49.229
they can’t fight them. But men themselves
fought;

25:49.430 --> 25:51.571
even in America it was Abraham Lincoln
who fought

25:51.772 --> 25:57.314
for the liberation of women, not women.

26:06.515 --> 26:16.839
So you have to be not egoistical,
but proud.

26:17.040 --> 26:21.144
Proud that you are Sahaja yogis, proud that
you are born in such a time

26:21.345 --> 26:26.194
when you have to carry on the duties
of God’s work.

26:26.395 --> 26:34.026
That God has chosen you! So that you
should come up to that level.

26:34.391 --> 26:37.134
Like some people I find suddenly become

26:37.335 --> 26:40.449
morose recluses, in Sahaja Yoga.

26:40.650 --> 26:45.808
They will never be forgiven because God
has given you so much.

26:46.438 --> 26:49.377
Supposing somebody gives you a diamond.
You are proud,

26:49.578 --> 26:54.990
you put it on and show-off. But when you
have been given your Spirit

26:55.191 --> 26:59.116
you should be proud and not to behave
like recluses.

26:59.317 --> 27:03.747
Some people feel, “I should not take
any job now.

27:03.948 --> 27:06.421
I’ll not go out, I’ll sit at home and
meditate.”

27:06.603 --> 27:10.580
There’s no place for such people
in Sahaja Yoga.

27:11.690 --> 27:16.973
“I can’t do this.” The word “can’t”
should go away

27:17.174 --> 27:23.094
from the dictionary of people who are
supposed to be Sahaja yogis.

27:23.295 --> 27:26.716
You just can’t say, “I can’t do it.”

27:33.625 --> 27:37.632
So the self-esteem will give you

27:37.833 --> 27:40.515
that kind of a dynamism which is needed
for Sahaja Yoga,

27:40.716 --> 27:45.600
a discreet dynamism, a wise dynamism.

27:47.416 --> 27:51.319
I won’t have to solve your problems
any more.

27:55.664 --> 28:00.330
The quality of competition and jealousy

28:04.540 --> 28:07.266
should be brought round.

28:09.104 --> 28:11.700
There should be competition between
yourself,

28:11.901 --> 28:16.283
the one what you were and what you are.

28:17.556 --> 28:22.847
Who wins? Whether your past or present?

28:28.299 --> 28:31.809
Your present should go fast, faster
and faster,

28:32.010 --> 28:37.107
leaving this past behind as much as
you can.

28:39.159 --> 28:44.757
There should be no competition between
Sahaja yogis in acquisition.

28:44.958 --> 28:49.535
Sometimes I have seen also competition
in shouting, screaming

28:49.736 --> 28:54.999
and being harsh to others – there’s
a big competition on.

28:56.602 --> 29:03.207
Let us have competition in compassion,
in mildness, in sweetness,

29:05.699 --> 29:12.081
in beautiful behaviour.

29:12.303 --> 29:18.687
Who is more cultured, who is more
gentlemanly, who is deeper;

29:18.888 --> 29:23.026
keep somebody an ideal before you
like that,

29:23.227 --> 29:31.537
whom you think is a very gentlemanly person
or a lady who is really like a lady.

29:33.341 --> 29:41.833
But on the contrary if you have a lady
who behaves like a man as your ideal,

29:42.034 --> 29:45.088
that is also not alright.

29:50.767 --> 29:56.257
Or a man who behaves like a woman,
that’s also not ideal.

29:56.458 --> 29:59.065
Or the other way round.

29:59.266 --> 30:02.589
A woman who tries to show that women
are different from men

30:02.790 --> 30:04.291
and women must get this…

30:04.492 --> 30:07.329
In Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like
women and men,

30:07.530 --> 30:09.646
that women must get this and men
must get that.

30:09.847 --> 30:14.041
Because you are Spirit. But the cover
that you have,

30:14.242 --> 30:19.012
the body that you have, the light you have,
the lamp that you have,

30:19.213 --> 30:22.759
is a different thing, and to keep
the light on,

30:22.960 --> 30:27.216
a woman has to be a woman and man
has to be a man.

30:27.462 --> 30:31.760
As yesterday I told you, that an apple
should not try

30:31.960 --> 30:36.106
to be a mango and mango should not try
to be an apple.

30:40.390 --> 30:46.592
It looks nice to be the best apple and
looks nice to be the best mango.

30:46.793 --> 30:50.919
So the recluses, those who say, that you
have to get out of it,

30:51.119 --> 30:54.795
behave really not like human beings
but I think like –

30:54.996 --> 30:59.691
I don’t know what animals do that way.

31:01.863 --> 31:07.577
Like when you get your doles you cannot
become indolent, you cannot.

31:07.778 --> 31:12.876
As far as possible I don’t like people
taking doles.

31:13.169 --> 31:15.158
Not a sign of good Sahaja yogis.

31:15.359 --> 31:17.716
You all should be hard working, you must
have qualifications,

31:17.917 --> 31:22.640
you should be good people on top
of everything.

31:23.564 --> 31:30.710
Good students, good cooks, good mothers,
good fathers,

31:30.911 --> 31:36.420
good administrators – from where are we
going to get these people?

31:38.937 --> 31:42.625
We cannot be dishwashers, can we?

31:49.178 --> 31:53.619
So the competition between women and men
must be stopped.

31:53.820 --> 31:56.780
Women must have their own place and men
must have their own place.

31:56.981 --> 32:00.641
And women must know that men are
their hands.

32:00.842 --> 32:02.976
If you are the shakti, they are
the machines

32:03.177 --> 32:05.275
and don’t kill your machines by shouting
at them,

32:05.476 --> 32:11.150
by screaming at them and by putting them
down, making them diffident.

32:11.351 --> 32:14.301
We’ll have no place.

32:20.460 --> 32:25.427
We have to encourage them to do God’s work.

32:25.628 --> 32:28.870
You have to support them, look after them,
because they are the machines,

32:29.071 --> 32:34.613
they are the hands and you are the power.

32:42.709 --> 32:50.758
Of course if these hands go against
the power they will suffer.

32:53.900 --> 32:57.429
So there should be no competition between
children and you –

32:57.630 --> 33:01.389
my child, and his child, there should be
not such competition,

33:01.590 --> 33:05.747
take out your mind from there. There should
be complete sharing.

33:05.948 --> 33:08.777
So the competition should end in sharing.

33:08.978 --> 33:13.739
How much we share? How much can we share?

33:14.791 --> 33:21.854
See drunkards can’t sit and drink alone.
They have to have some people to share.

33:23.754 --> 33:27.749
The thieves must have ten people to thieve.

33:30.140 --> 33:33.718
But when it comes to the nectar
of God’s love

33:33.919 --> 33:40.025
how can we alone have it? Cannot enjoy.
There’s no enjoyment at all in it.

33:40.226 --> 33:44.734
So let us be gentle and kind with
each other.

33:52.233 --> 33:56.692
The people who are going to enjoy
the nectar

33:57.655 --> 34:00.793
should have competition in sharing
that nectar

34:01.003 --> 34:04.743
by which they get more and more of that.

34:04.944 --> 34:09.458
Who shares more? Who is more generous?

34:14.350 --> 34:18.938
Materialism should be taken to its beauty.

34:22.411 --> 34:26.350
You can have one thing done with your hand.

34:29.145 --> 34:35.105
That’s much more beautiful than running
after money, counting money,

34:35.306 --> 34:39.579
you’ll become crackpots really.

34:39.780 --> 34:44.880
Those who count their money morning
till evening are real crackpots.

34:45.081 --> 34:50.165
They always lose money, there’s something
wrong with their brains.

34:51.553 --> 34:54.602
Count your blessings.

35:00.816 --> 35:07.682
See life, the beauty in matter.
How life has worked.

35:07.883 --> 35:14.501
See a wood, I see, I see the pattern
it has created on that, the life.

35:14.702 --> 35:25.683
But it’s not morose, it’s not dead,
it’s not insipid, it’s bubbling.

35:30.958 --> 35:36.476
You can see in art, you can see in all
that is beautiful,

35:36.677 --> 35:41.338
the reflection of God’s creative power

35:41.539 --> 35:44.431
and the joy that He wanted to emit
for your happiness.

35:44.632 --> 35:46.302
While you become slaves of matter.

35:46.503 --> 35:51.075
He never wanted you to do that.
You are the masters.

35:53.441 --> 35:58.965
Last of all is the attachment to your
children,

35:59.821 --> 36:04.641
to your wife, your, your, your…

36:04.842 --> 36:13.093
Whatever is mine is not ‘I’. My house,
that’s not ‘I’.

36:13.570 --> 36:19.883
My this, my, my, my, must be given up,
‘Mamatva’ is to be destroyed.

36:21.588 --> 36:26.760
Instead of that, you should say ‘we’.
‘We’ is a good word.

36:26.961 --> 36:32.190
I so many times say ‘we’. And then people
start wondering...

36:32.391 --> 36:37.376
One day, somebody asked me, “Mother,
when you say ‘we’, what do you mean?

36:37.577 --> 36:44.500
How can you make us feel that way, that we
are all one, the way you say ‘we’?”

36:44.701 --> 36:51.060
I said, “Why not? You are part and parcel
of My body. Aren’t we ‘we’?”

36:51.261 --> 36:56.375
Do I separate My finger from My heart?

36:57.665 --> 37:03.521
If you are part and parcel of My body
then I have to talk like ‘we’

37:03.722 --> 37:09.134
because I’m conscious of this collective
being sitting here.

37:10.683 --> 37:17.373
So we have to talk like ‘we’ and not
‘I, my’.

37:19.757 --> 37:26.199
And when you have to address about yourself
speak it in a third person.

37:26.957 --> 37:33.628
Like you can say: “This Nirmala is now
going to London.”

37:33.829 --> 37:40.920
Really, is true, because this body’s going
there but My heart is going to remain here.

37:43.491 --> 37:52.107
So to say that I am going is not true –
if I am Adi Shakti where am I going?

37:52.420 --> 37:56.513
I’m going nowhere, I’m everywhere.
Where can I go?

37:56.714 --> 38:01.570
There’s no place where I don’t reside
and if I have to go to such a place,

38:01.771 --> 38:05.835
it’s Hell only where I don’t want to go.

38:09.656 --> 38:16.369
So, what I say that, “This Nirmala
is going now.

38:17.808 --> 38:23.723
Leaving Australia.” Tomorrow I’ll be
leaving.

38:23.924 --> 38:27.511
So what happens?

38:29.684 --> 38:36.578
Just this body has to move – that’s all.

38:36.779 --> 38:43.527
Like that, you start saying about your
body.

38:43.728 --> 38:48.705
“This mind of mine, this mind of Mr.
So and So.”

38:48.906 --> 38:53.779
Is better to address yourself as Mr.
or Mrs. or Miss.

38:53.980 --> 38:58.961
“So Miss, will you please get up now?”
Better address yourself.

38:59.162 --> 39:04.183
Children talk like that. Like a third
person.

39:04.384 --> 39:11.378
You’ll be amazed, you will see the joke
behind the whole thing.

39:11.579 --> 39:13.760
You’ll know how to laugh at yourself.

39:13.961 --> 39:19.447
“Oh so Mr., come along, now he’s behaving
like this.”

39:20.885 --> 39:23.396
And you’ll really become a master
of yourself,

39:23.597 --> 39:27.637
because you know how to handle this baby.

39:34.947 --> 39:38.820
It will give you that sense of maturity.

39:44.039 --> 39:47.596
So to say, “This is my child, this is
my wife”;

39:47.797 --> 39:50.141
of course, you have to look after your wife
and your children

39:50.342 --> 39:54.088
because they’re your responsibility

39:54.289 --> 39:59.774
but do for other children more than you
would like to do for your own child.

40:00.747 --> 40:03.938
(There is somebody who has come.)

40:27.641 --> 40:35.740
So this complete identification with your
children, over protectiveness,

40:35.941 --> 40:39.699
will give you trouble. You have to believe

40:39.900 --> 40:49.408
that your family is the family of your
Father,

40:51.143 --> 40:54.776
and your Mother is looking after it.

40:54.977 --> 41:00.443
If you think you can look after your family
by yourself – go ahead!

41:01.800 --> 41:08.904
So don’t be overprotective, don’t be too
worried, too upset about your family.

41:11.831 --> 41:17.037
And keep a very sociable temperament

41:17.238 --> 41:21.745
so that your children also don’t become
like you.

41:21.946 --> 41:24.778
Tell them how to share.

41:26.530 --> 41:30.968
If one child has fallen off ask other
children to help.

41:31.169 --> 41:33.906
Form plays in which you should show,

41:34.107 --> 41:38.578
how a child who is coming, who cannot
walk properly,

41:38.779 --> 41:44.191
how other children go and try and find out
methods how to help him to come out.

41:44.382 --> 41:50.983
Teach them, through dramas, through
stories, through various things,

41:51.184 --> 41:54.611
what is goodness.

41:55.536 --> 41:58.783
You must help even without the idea
of help.

41:58.984 --> 42:07.719
It’s a pleasure, it’s a privilege.
It’s a great honour that you can do it.

42:07.920 --> 42:12.058
We must change our ideas completely.

42:12.383 --> 42:14.800
Many people have a habit to serve
‘your’ child first –

42:15.001 --> 42:20.932
is absolutely very vulgar, shows bad
breeding.

42:21.227 --> 42:25.857
Must serve others first, and then your
own family.

42:28.332 --> 42:32.939
Keeping something back for your children,
hiding some food for your children –

42:33.140 --> 42:39.155
is all a sign of a person who is like
a ‘kupamanduka’,

42:39.356 --> 42:45.576
means ‘a frog who lives in a small well’.

42:47.615 --> 42:49.931
Get over it.

42:52.087 --> 42:56.969
Try, men to form your own group of men

42:57.170 --> 43:01.098
and women should form their group of women.

43:01.299 --> 43:09.849
There should be no instruction to women
from men too much. Is not proper.

43:10.481 --> 43:14.119
I have discovered so many funny things,

43:14.320 --> 43:19.508
I can’t understand, how these things
work out.

43:19.709 --> 43:26.018
But, it is because one side you feel your
family is too much,

43:26.219 --> 43:33.062
your husband is too much, you must be
absolutely secluded from all the rest,

43:33.263 --> 43:37.280
or on the other side it is that you give up
your husband completely -

43:37.480 --> 43:41.642
he is no good, the marriage is
unsuccessful, stick on to something else

43:41.843 --> 43:47.492
which is supposed to be a something,
higher goal of destruction.

43:48.027 --> 43:51.661
So both things are not good.

43:53.616 --> 44:00.825
You must stand for your husband or wife
or for your children, when it is right.

44:01.026 --> 44:04.388
But obviously you should not do it,
apparently you should not do it.

44:04.589 --> 44:06.832
You should tell your child, “Alright,
I understand,

44:07.033 --> 44:10.874
but I don’t want to do it in the public.”

44:11.976 --> 44:15.163
People should not also know that he’s
your child.

44:15.364 --> 44:18.500
The way he mixes up with others, stays
with others,

44:18.701 --> 44:23.007
shares with others, that’s how a Sahaja
yogi should be.

44:26.637 --> 44:28.238
You know as for myself,

44:28.439 --> 44:33.740
I’ve not even given realisation
to my children so far.

44:35.047 --> 44:42.017
Can you believe it? Leave alone the
knowledge of Kundalini. You can teach them.

44:43.137 --> 44:47.071
I know I can give them any time I want to.

44:51.222 --> 44:55.384
I have not given them time at all,
no time to them.

44:55.585 --> 45:01.377
If you see, how much time do I spend with
My own daughters? Very little time.

45:01.578 --> 45:07.442
In the whole year, this year I was there
for three days with her.

45:09.928 --> 45:13.069
So the relationship at this time is
the most important,

45:13.270 --> 45:17.117
is of Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja yogis.

45:17.318 --> 45:20.716
I have seen some Sahaja yogis write
to their parents, to their mothers,

45:20.917 --> 45:26.239
to their brothers, much more than they
write to the other Sahaja yogis.

45:26.761 --> 45:29.704
Is very amazing.

45:31.049 --> 45:36.019
To their fathers but not to other
Sahaja yogis.

45:37.035 --> 45:38.834
You must start writing to other
Sahaja yogis.

45:39.035 --> 45:42.120
Those who have lived in London,
how many of them

45:42.321 --> 45:45.193
are writing to people in London? Have
they made any friends or anything? –

45:45.394 --> 45:49.592
Nothing of the kind. They are so busy
with their own problems,

45:49.793 --> 45:58.365
they’re not bothered, to create that
bondage of love.

46:00.759 --> 46:04.092
As if they have no interest in Sahaja Yoga.

46:04.293 --> 46:10.538
They stayed in the ashram, in London. How
many of you are writing letters to them?

46:10.768 --> 46:13.829
To London people. How many letters
do you write?

46:14.030 --> 46:16.519
Now you have met them in this programme,

46:16.720 --> 46:20.288
how many of you are writing letters
to them and keep in contact?

46:20.489 --> 46:24.663
How much does it take to write a letter?
Nothing.

46:28.082 --> 46:31.550
I hope as soon as you go back today you
all should write letters

46:31.751 --> 46:36.447
about today’s Birthday – how it was
celebrated, in a beautiful way.

46:36.648 --> 46:43.403
Not to your family, not to your people,
but to others.

46:43.604 --> 46:46.708
All of them are all over, you know how
they are.

46:46.909 --> 46:50.386
You write to them because you know
they are the heads of the thing.

46:50.587 --> 46:57.394
Like if you write to Gregoire or you can
write to Ruth in Italy,

46:57.595 --> 47:03.918
you can write to Genevieve in Geneva.

47:04.291 --> 47:08.326
You have met all of them – you should
write!

47:10.297 --> 47:13.996
Ladies must write to ladies and men must
write to men.

47:14.197 --> 47:18.149
Arneau is in Lausanne: why not write
to him?

47:18.350 --> 47:23.739
He’s there; now do you know that his wife
has to go to America for a delivery?

47:23.940 --> 47:26.099
We should know about each other,
very intimately.

47:26.300 --> 47:32.131
About how many people I know so many
things, all the details.

47:37.649 --> 47:42.518
That’s how; you must flood yourself
with that love.

47:42.719 --> 47:47.639
Tomorrow you go to America or to any
one of these places,

47:47.840 --> 47:52.407
you have there your brothers and sisters
already established.

47:53.035 --> 47:56.919
Write to them about your Mother,
what you think.

47:58.313 --> 48:03.529
You only write to Me sometimes but never
to each other.

48:05.588 --> 48:10.823
Don’t write too big letters to Me
especially.

48:13.592 --> 48:17.839
But write nice, sweet letters, poetic
letters,

48:18.040 --> 48:21.930
they’ll feel happy, it’s like sending
flowers.

48:23.758 --> 48:29.153
Taking ideas from there it will be
a very good idea.

48:29.354 --> 48:31.797
(What’s the matter?)

48:44.631 --> 48:52.197
This will overcome these six enemies
and make them your slaves

48:52.398 --> 48:56.309
and use them for your purpose.

48:56.684 --> 49:02.805
Then they’ll become great things.
Then they’ll be your assistants,

49:04.453 --> 49:15.677
then they wlll be your commanders of your
army, they’ll be your decorations.

49:17.565 --> 49:22.667
It is all in your hands. With wisdom,
you have to do it.

49:24.526 --> 49:30.400
At this time, at the age where I’ve
reached –

49:34.995 --> 49:39.203
I was always there, same age,

49:40.271 --> 49:45.011
I’ve been always mature like this,
child like this,

49:46.068 --> 49:52.077
just like a young girl and an old woman,
all put together,

49:52.278 --> 49:55.610
every year, every time.

49:55.986 --> 50:00.297
But I’ve definitely matured in understanding
human beings.

50:03.851 --> 50:06.989
I’ve definitely got better understanding
and maturity

50:07.190 --> 50:11.532
as far as My knowledge about human beings
are concerned because they are...

50:11.733 --> 50:14.553
When I was born they were strangers
to Me – just strangers.

50:14.754 --> 50:18.598
Imagine that Adi Shakti should say this,
but it’s true!

50:18.799 --> 50:26.490
Despite I have created you, I was
absolutely a stranger.

50:30.410 --> 50:35.190
But now, I’ve grown, I’ve understood you
very well,

50:37.489 --> 50:43.875
I know you are My children, I know how much
you love Me

50:44.506 --> 50:47.099
and how much you are close to Me.

50:47.300 --> 50:50.896
[Shri Mataji: Why is he crying so much?
Yogi: He wants to go to the toilet, Mother.

50:51.097 --> 50:53.894
Shri Mataji: Let him take away.
Yogi: He wants me to go with him

50:54.095 --> 50:57.409
but I’m trying to say he can go himself,
but...

50:57.630 --> 50:59.371
Shri Mataji: Let him go, this is the thing,
you see,

50:59.572 --> 51:01.375
these children are very obstinate,
I personally think.

51:01.576 --> 51:04.169
Yogi: Yeah. He wants me to go with him.
That’s the thing, that’s why.

51:04.370 --> 51:06.011
Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s bhootish,
isn’t it?

51:06.212 --> 51:08.964
Yogi: Yes, that’s what I’m saying.
Shri Mataji: We can think - let him go.

51:09.165 --> 51:12.036
He won’t listen.

51:12.546 --> 51:16.701
Better go. See.

51:21.436 --> 51:23.346
All right, take him down.

51:23.547 --> 51:28.231
What to do, you see, they are very
obstinate. They are bhoots.

51:28.448 --> 51:32.282
Such a big boy can’t go to the toilet?
Yogi: Yes...

51:38.980 --> 51:42.429
Shri Mataji: Just to disturb him,
that’s all.

51:46.150 --> 51:48.824
May God bless you.

51:51.087 --> 51:52.595
You must really slap him now,

51:52.796 --> 51:56.179
if you give two slaps now, his bhoot
will go away.

51:56.379 --> 51:58.478
Two slaps are needed. Next time
he won’t do it.

51:58.680 --> 52:00.860
You see at this time you must slap,

52:01.061 --> 52:05.404
not very hard but let him know that
you don’t like it.

52:09.204 --> 52:11.688
Bhoots can sometimes can go away
only with slapping.

52:11.889 --> 52:14.808
I have seen especially with children
it happens.

52:15.009 --> 52:17.897
Two slaps on the face and they’re alright.

52:18.098 --> 52:21.850
Because they’re bhoots, you see, and they
have to go away.]

52:23.657 --> 52:28.371
Now whatever I have said to you yesterday
for children be careful.

52:28.572 --> 52:35.891
You have to make your children assets
and not liabilities, on Sahaja Yoga.

52:42.628 --> 52:45.232
So try to train them up properly.

52:45.433 --> 52:50.895
Bring them up, they deserve a good hand,
to handle.

52:51.312 --> 52:55.595
In the beginning you have to be very strict
and punish them if they do anything wrong,

52:55.796 --> 52:59.422
so they know what is right, what is wrong.

53:01.751 --> 53:06.581
And once they grow up you’ll be amazed
what an asset they are.

53:09.937 --> 53:13.340
Some of them are very good children

53:13.804 --> 53:17.161
but if the influence of the bad children
comes up too much,

53:17.362 --> 53:20.589
they might spoil the good children also.

53:20.790 --> 53:27.386
So better encourage children, who are good,
who have been very sweet.

53:29.616 --> 53:37.750
So I think of My young age, of My childhood

53:38.349 --> 53:41.949
and the dream, how it has come true.

53:45.626 --> 53:50.944
Whatever I have dreamt, is beyond
my imagination.

53:53.578 --> 54:00.813
It’s done now, as far as I’m concerned
you don’t need Me much, any more.

54:01.107 --> 54:05.430
I’ve told you whatever was needed
for your counselling.

54:05.630 --> 54:12.593
I have taught you the methods how to redeem
others, and comfort them.

54:12.794 --> 54:18.687
You know everything. Now just become
masters in this art.

54:19.865 --> 54:27.675
Forgetting your past. You are all great
people, all of you.

54:28.193 --> 54:35.189
So, even next year, I should see you

54:35.390 --> 54:42.531
sitting on this seat, not in My lap.

54:45.322 --> 54:50.977
On your own, teaching your children.

54:51.599 --> 54:57.225
Let the second generation start now.
The first generation is ready,

54:57.433 --> 55:00.077
now the second generation has to come
and you have to look after

55:00.278 --> 55:03.299
the second generation.

55:04.024 --> 55:11.435
I want to be a real grandmother of very
grand children,

55:16.642 --> 55:21.811
that’s a special privilege and real
promotion and maturity.

55:24.335 --> 55:27.005
Look at this (rain is pouring down).

55:27.380 --> 55:31.211
He’s going to flood your Parramatta
(river in Sydney).

55:32.999 --> 55:37.692
Because I have said now I’m the Holy Ghost,

55:40.949 --> 55:45.829
everybody seems to be over-happy and
joyous.

55:51.605 --> 55:56.584
So thank you very much, for having Me here

55:56.785 --> 56:01.948
and think of all the Sahaja yogis all
around the world, all of them.

56:02.149 --> 56:06.056
Today, I think we should send some
telegrams, about twelve telegrams

56:06.257 --> 56:11.240
if possible, to all the centres, saying

56:11.441 --> 56:16.779
60th Birthday of Mother was celebrated
with great joy.

56:16.980 --> 56:21.873
She sends blessings, or something.
They’ll be very happy.

56:24.799 --> 56:29.378
But according to Indian method it is 61st

56:29.579 --> 56:33.636
because the day I was born, that was also
a birthday.

56:33.837 --> 56:38.119
That was a real birthday. So they
call it 61,

56:38.320 --> 56:42.791
and we are going to have a big programme
in India also.

56:43.918 --> 56:49.872
You are specially favoured people,

56:50.073 --> 56:53.583
and I hope you’ll favour Me specially too.

56:53.768 --> 56:59.203
This year I hope, all of you are going
to take up a new role

56:59.404 --> 57:04.290
and a new style of life where you become
mild people,

57:04.616 --> 57:11.194
not docile men but mild people and docile
women.

57:16.415 --> 57:23.962
Women have to be more docile, domesticated.

57:24.507 --> 57:27.028
They’ll look nice.

57:27.782 --> 57:35.656
They’ll become gentle, they’ll smile
better, they(’ll) create such joy.

57:36.495 --> 57:42.136
We are here to create joy and not to enjoy
some rights, which are artificial,

57:42.337 --> 57:46.336
to create joy. How much joy do we create?

57:47.099 --> 57:55.249
How much joy do we give to others?
So today on this great occasion,

57:56.372 --> 58:02.278
we have to feel our joy, within our heart.

58:02.479 --> 58:08.467
Very deep down within us lies that source
of joy.

58:08.668 --> 58:12.073
So we have to go deep down within ourselves

58:12.274 --> 58:18.978
and feel the joy of this sixty-year old
Mother of yours, that I have within Myself.

58:19.186 --> 58:24.707
Go deep down, it’s there, enjoy it and then
give it to others.

58:24.908 --> 58:28.290
Like a fountain of joy you should give.

58:29.917 --> 58:32.319
May God bless you.

58:37.597 --> 58:41.871
Declare to all the nations now,
that I am the Holy Ghost

58:42.080 --> 58:49.091
and I have come for this special time,
that is the resurrection time.
