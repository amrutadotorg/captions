05:17.709 --> 05:21.083
Oh, I would suggest that first let them ask questions today.

05:21.667 --> 05:25.458
So I keep myself there…

05:25.709 --> 05:26.834
If you have any questions,

05:27.208 --> 05:28.834
it's better to ask me first.

05:29.125 --> 05:32.917
So that your mind is at rest.

05:38.250 --> 05:43.458
I'm glad to stand.…better to see people better.

05:52.999 --> 05:56.208
Am I better here or on the ground?

06:00.667 --> 06:02.917
Now, first of all it’s better to ask the questions

06:03.250 --> 06:09.583
because yesterday when we started this question session

06:09.917 --> 06:11.333
people got little deviated.

06:11.625 --> 06:13.583
It’s better to ask questions now, what you have,

06:13.834 --> 06:15.500
because you are all seekers.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.959
You are all seekers and you have been seeking

06:19.208 --> 06:21.834
so is best is to ask questions now, so I’ll be able

06:22.125 --> 06:29.959
to put the answer in between My lecture.

07:12.083 --> 07:13.625
No questions?

07:21.417 --> 07:23.959
That means Sahaja Yogis have become quite capable

07:24.291 --> 07:28.959
of explaining Sahaja Yoga and I’m very proud of them.

07:30.959 --> 07:33.625
When I went to Australia the newspaper people

07:33.875 --> 07:37.834
asked Me, “Mother, are all Your disciples scholars?”

07:38.041 --> 07:39.959
I said, “No, they are very common people.

07:40.250 --> 07:42.959
They have to be very common and normal people.”

07:43.500 --> 07:44.999
But they said, “The way they know things,

07:45.250 --> 07:48.500
surprisingly we feel they are all scholars.”

07:48.750 --> 07:51.291
I said, “All scholarship is within yourself.”

07:51.542 --> 07:53.875
All the knowledge is within yourself.

07:54.083 --> 07:58.709
If you only can get light there, you can see

07:58.875 --> 08:00.625
all that knowledge is within you.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.291
You don’t have to go anywhere for your knowledge.

08:03.625 --> 08:07.083
It’s all inside, everything is built in.

08:08.041 --> 08:15.375
You are built in so beautifully to become your Spirit

08:15.625 --> 08:18.875
that I don’t have to do much about it. It just works out.

08:19.083 --> 08:21.875
Only thing is that one has to know what

08:22.083 --> 08:25.375
we should expect; to be the Spirit,

08:25.750 --> 08:27.834
what should be our expectation.

08:28.166 --> 08:31.041
And that also logically you must understand.

08:31.291 --> 08:33.959
It should be a logical conclusion.

08:34.208 --> 08:36.959
Not just because I say something,

08:37.208 --> 08:39.667
because you have become a member of some group,

08:39.999 --> 08:41.750
because you have paid money somewhere.

08:41.959 --> 08:45.625
It’s not that way. Reality is what it is.

08:45.875 --> 08:49.166
And logically it has to be reality.

08:50.834 --> 08:58.208
The other day I told you about the left side, about the past,

08:58.417 --> 09:00.750
about the subconscious, about the collective subconscious

09:00.959 --> 09:05.750
and the problems of the subconscious and the conditionings

09:05.999 --> 09:09.542
we get from material things, from matter.

09:09.834 --> 09:14.291
Matter is always trying to overpower the Spirit.

09:15.041 --> 09:20.166
And this matter is overpowering us because

09:20.417 --> 09:23.375
we come from matter to begin with.

09:24.083 --> 09:27.875
But how does the Spirit come out of it?

09:28.542 --> 09:34.792
What happens that we become the Spirit?

09:36.041 --> 09:38.625
People have talked about Self Realization.

09:38.875 --> 09:43.041
So many people have talked about second birth.

09:43.417 --> 09:46.333
Everyone has said that you are to be born again.

09:46.542 --> 09:48.333
There are many people who go about saying,

09:48.625 --> 09:51.500
“I’m twice born,” self certified.

09:51.667 --> 09:54.417
You can find all kinds of people in this world,

09:54.625 --> 10:01.750
who are knowing that something has to happen,

10:01.999 --> 10:04.166
some breakthrough has to take place,

10:04.667 --> 10:06.208
something we have to seek.

10:06.500 --> 10:08.875
Imagine at the time of Christ there were not

10:09.041 --> 10:11.417
so many people who were seeking,

10:11.667 --> 10:14.166
nobody could talk to the disciples also much.

10:14.542 --> 10:18.417
They were just ordinary fishermen, very simple people.

10:18.667 --> 10:20.875
But today is the time when you find so many

10:21.083 --> 10:26.542
of seekers all over the world. Seeking what?

10:26.875 --> 10:33.875
What are you seeking? The seeking is of your Spirit.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.208
Now this is also a very vague term to say

10:36.542 --> 10:37.625
you are seeking your Spirit.

10:37.875 --> 10:40.166
Now what is this Spirit supposed to be?

10:40.333 --> 10:44.500
And why should we seek this Spirit?

10:44.750 --> 10:48.917
In our evolution we are human beings,

10:49.333 --> 10:54.083
our awareness is that of human beings and this awareness

10:54.333 --> 10:59.041
of human beings is not the ultimate.

11:00.625 --> 11:06.208
If it was we would not have been seeking.

11:07.083 --> 11:09.208
It’s not the end of it.

11:09.542 --> 11:12.417
We have to reach at a point where

11:12.750 --> 11:16.333
something more has to happen.

11:16.667 --> 11:19.792
Now how do we approach the subject logically?

11:20.041 --> 11:24.625
In our evolution, what has happened to us?

11:25.625 --> 11:30.417
We were animals, from there we became human beings.

11:30.792 --> 11:36.291
What is so special about human beings compared to animals?

11:37.083 --> 11:40.999
In the awareness of man there’s a new dimension.

11:41.208 --> 11:44.166
For example you can take a horse through a dirty lane,

11:44.417 --> 11:46.750
he doesn’t feel anything, the dirt or filth,

11:46.917 --> 11:50.625
or beauty, colors, nothing. Makes no difference.

11:50.875 --> 11:54.750
But if you take a human being through a dirty lane or a

11:54.999 --> 12:00.417
dirty house, immediately he understands, he doesn’t like it.

12:01.625 --> 12:06.667
So what has come into us is nothing but in our awareness

12:06.999 --> 12:11.083
a new dimension compared to animals,

12:11.333 --> 12:18.999
or we can say in very scientific way is that in our central

12:19.291 --> 12:25.291
nervous system we have developed a new awareness.

12:27.417 --> 12:29.291
Whatever is in our central nervous system,

12:29.667 --> 12:34.583
we are master of that. Supposing I feel this is hot,

12:34.917 --> 12:36.792
everybody will feel this is hot.

12:37.417 --> 12:44.291
If I say this is the color of this particular bird,

12:44.750 --> 12:47.875
everybody will say the same thing.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.667
So whatever is the awareness of one human being,

12:50.917 --> 12:53.750
awareness I am saying, not the myth, not the hallucination,

12:53.999 --> 13:02.583
but the reality as far as his organs are concerned,

13:02.875 --> 13:06.417
sensory organs are concerned is just the same.

13:06.667 --> 13:11.750
A person who feels hot does not say that he feels cold,

13:11.999 --> 13:14.125
nor the other one will come and say it is cold,

13:14.417 --> 13:19.875
they all will say it is hot. So one thing is there,

13:20.083 --> 13:24.917
the truth is one, it cannot be two,

13:25.208 --> 13:27.417
and that whatever has to happen now in our

13:27.917 --> 13:31.999
evolution has to be in our awareness.

13:32.291 --> 13:34.333
Like a fish became a turtle.

13:34.667 --> 13:38.208
If a fish became a turtle, what happened to her?

13:38.458 --> 13:41.917
It is in the awareness of the turtle,

13:46.458 --> 13:50.792
it started feeling the Mother Earth. It lost something

13:50.999 --> 13:54.667
that fish had and it started feeling something new.

13:54.917 --> 13:57.458
In the same way, in our evolution if something

13:57.667 --> 14:02.291
has to happen, we have to be something more

14:02.542 --> 14:07.999
in awareness, more dynamic. For this we can take

14:08.208 --> 14:14.542
help from the writings of so many people.

14:14.709 --> 14:17.083
For example we can consider Jung

14:17.250 --> 14:20.667
as one of them who has talked about it.

14:20.917 --> 14:31.250
Jung has said that when the breakthrough will take place,

14:32.999 --> 14:34.667
the human beings will become,

14:34.999 --> 14:39.792
will become collectively conscious, will become.

14:39.999 --> 14:44.125
He didn’t say that you’ll all start doing the same thing

14:44.417 --> 14:47.250
or you will start behaving in the same manner.

14:47.583 --> 14:51.125
No, he said you will become, you will be aware of it,

14:51.333 --> 14:55.583
not unawares. So when you are seeking the Spirit,

14:55.792 --> 15:01.333
if the Spirit has to enlighten you, in your awareness you are

15:01.542 --> 15:07.709
going to know something more than you have known so far.

15:08.999 --> 15:12.208
For example, you might feel it hot and cold today

15:12.250 --> 15:13.917
but maybe with that awareness you might

15:14.041 --> 15:17.458
feel something different about it.

15:19.125 --> 15:21.458
He has said it very clearly that you have

15:21.709 --> 15:24.667
to become collectively conscious.

15:24.834 --> 15:27.834
So the becoming is the point in our evolution,

15:27.999 --> 15:31.333
nothing else, we become something else.

15:31.583 --> 15:35.834
In Sanskrit language for example they say, for a realized

15:35.999 --> 15:39.041
Soul, for Indians it’s very common knowledge,

15:39.333 --> 15:42.709
it’s nothing so much difficult to understand,

15:43.125 --> 15:49.208
he’s called as a dwijaha, the one who is born again.

15:49.458 --> 15:52.792
And also a bird is called as a dwijaha,

15:52.999 --> 15:56.917
because a bird is born first as an egg and then it grows,

15:57.125 --> 16:01.917
matures and then suddenly it becomes a bird.

16:01.917 --> 16:05.333
And that is the parallel of Realization.

16:05.625 --> 16:08.834
You also know that on the Easter Day we give eggs.

16:09.041 --> 16:11.959
It has the same symbol, that we are eggs and

16:12.125 --> 16:14.792
we have to become the birds.

16:15.041 --> 16:17.917
So just now, at this stage when we are human beings

16:18.166 --> 16:26.250
we are just limited like an egg to grow up to a point

16:26.500 --> 16:28.917
where you can become the bird.

16:29.125 --> 16:35.250
All other sort of things people talk of is not the Realization.

16:35.500 --> 16:39.917
Like I may say that “All right, if I mesmerize you very well,

16:40.166 --> 16:42.625
I can give you bottles and you might start

16:42.834 --> 16:46.500
sucking the bottles just like children.”

16:46.834 --> 16:48.750
Even knowing that you are doing something funny,

16:48.999 --> 16:50.999
you are doing it.

16:51.333 --> 16:54.834
You’ll be compelled to do it because you are mesmerized.

16:54.999 --> 17:00.709
Any such activity that you fall into is not Realization

17:00.959 --> 17:04.583
because whatever has happened to you as human beings

17:04.750 --> 17:08.917
that you are, you have done no activity whatsoever.

17:09.125 --> 17:11.500
We didn’t cut our tails as monkeys to

17:11.834 --> 17:14.959
become human beings. It has happened spontaneously

17:15.166 --> 17:19.709
like a flower becoming a fruit. It’s a living process.

17:20.041 --> 17:23.250
One does not realize that whatever has to happen

17:23.500 --> 17:27.458
to you is a living process, is not a dead process.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.500
What we can do is all dead.

17:29.709 --> 17:32.125
For example we can stand on our heads, we can jump,

17:32.375 --> 17:35.625
we can run, we can do all kinds of things but

17:35.917 --> 17:38.125
that is not the living process.

17:38.375 --> 17:42.041
The living process is when you become something,

17:42.333 --> 17:46.500
and that becoming must be asked by all honest seekers.

17:46.709 --> 17:49.583
If you are not honest, then it’s difficult,

17:49.834 --> 17:52.375
or even if you are honest and you are misidentified

17:52.625 --> 17:54.917
with certain ideas you have read because you have paid

17:55.041 --> 17:56.750
for the book or you have paid for an organization

17:56.959 --> 18:00.041
or paid for someone, that’s not going to help you.

18:00.375 --> 18:03.291
What we have to see what we become,

18:03.625 --> 18:08.291
and that’s what yesterday I told that you become the master.

18:08.500 --> 18:10.959
You become the prophet as Blake has said that,

18:11.166 --> 18:12.750
“God of men [Shri Mataji may mean “Men of God”]

18:12.917 --> 18:14.875
will become prophets and they will have

18:15.125 --> 18:17.750
powers to make others prophets.”

18:17.999 --> 18:19.999
So to be very honest with yourself you should say,

18:20.291 --> 18:26.375
“Have I become a prophet and can I make others prophets?”

18:26.709 --> 18:30.375
This is a very simple way of looking at our Realization

18:30.625 --> 18:33.834
and this what you are capable of,

18:33.999 --> 18:36.959
that you become the prophet, because everything is within you,

18:37.125 --> 18:39.583
the whole machinery is within you, you are like a computer,

18:39.750 --> 18:42.250
you are just to be put to the mains, it will start working.

18:42.500 --> 18:45.834
You have to just become that.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.834
And if you do not become that, then all other things,

18:50.959 --> 18:55.125
forming an organization and any such thing, is of no use,

18:55.417 --> 19:04.834
is of no value, is all, I can say, misguidance.

19:05.041 --> 19:06.750
What have you got yourself?

19:06.959 --> 19:09.250
Supposing, I mean, if Ray has to say something:

19:09.500 --> 19:12.291
“Oh, Mother saw a light, and this happened and that happened;

19:12.583 --> 19:16.583
She has these powers, and those powers,” it’s all useless.

19:16.750 --> 19:17.999
What is it to you?

19:18.291 --> 19:21.500
I may be the king of anything, so what does it matter to you?

19:21.834 --> 19:25.625
What has become of you is the important thing and for that

19:25.875 --> 19:28.500
becoming if I say there is everything placed within you

19:28.834 --> 19:33.166
I have to prove it that’s all.

19:33.750 --> 19:38.125
This knowledge is not unknown to us, actually.

19:38.375 --> 19:41.166
Is all been described from the time of Moses.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.583
Like He says,

19:43.875 --> 19:46.583
“The tree of fire.” Now what is the tree of fire?

19:46.999 --> 19:50.041
Nobody knows, they just say there was tree of fire.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.166
But if you see the Kundalini completely enlightened,

19:52.417 --> 19:58.250
if you can see it really looks like a tree of fire.

19:58.959 --> 20:01.166
And then it is said also in the Bible that,

20:01.500 --> 20:04.750
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames.”

20:04.959 --> 20:07.834
Now what is that? No one explains, nobody knows,

20:08.166 --> 20:11.166
these tongues of flames are nothing but these centers when

20:11.500 --> 20:16.583
they are enlightened, you see them just like tongues of flames.

20:16.875 --> 20:20.250
But you need not see them because when you are outside

20:20.542 --> 20:22.750
the pavilion you can see the pavilion; when you are inside

20:23.041 --> 20:27.041
you don’t see, you just see the hall.

20:27.291 --> 20:34.041
And that is why one should understand that it is not what

20:34.542 --> 20:39.875
we think should happen, but it is what will

20:40.125 --> 20:43.166
happen actually we should accept.

20:43.625 --> 20:45.959
So first we should get rid of all misidentifications

20:46.291 --> 20:49.291
with our ideas that this will happen, that will happen,

20:49.625 --> 20:51.875
and this should happen, I should see a light,

20:52.041 --> 20:54.750
I should fly in the air.

20:55.083 --> 20:56.375
There are many people who are paying

20:56.625 --> 20:59.959
money to fly in the air. I mean it’s absurd.

21:00.166 --> 21:01.834
Why do you want to fly in the air? I don’t understand.

21:02.083 --> 21:05.417
Paying much more money for that than they would

21:05.834 --> 21:07.834
have to pay to go round the whole world.

21:08.041 --> 21:09.834
I really tell you by plane if you have to travel

21:10.041 --> 21:11.166
it won’t so expensive as you are paying

21:11.500 --> 21:14.625
for this flying business, this Flying Squad business.

21:14.959 --> 21:17.500
And what is that, we have to understand, what is that?

21:17.875 --> 21:21.417
When we go for this flying what are we getting into?

21:21.667 --> 21:25.250
And this method of mesmerism is so subtle

21:25.500 --> 21:29.542
that you cannot understand.  You just go on it.

21:29.999 --> 21:35.250
Like the same Flying Squad business, we had a gentleman

21:35.750 --> 21:39.291
who was the director of the academy,

21:39.542 --> 21:42.250
down with epilepsy, his wife down with epilepsy,

21:42.500 --> 21:46.291
the child down with epilepsy; and they all came down to Me,

21:46.625 --> 21:49.999
they lost their houses, they lost everything, penniless.

21:51.083 --> 21:55.208
This is what has happened to the flying of the whole joke.

21:55.500 --> 22:00.083
Now, one must realize that you cannot pay

22:01.625 --> 22:03.834
for your evolution, you cannot pay.

22:04.041 --> 22:05.375
It’s very simple to understand.

22:05.542 --> 22:07.625
As I told yesterday that if you pay to this

22:07.875 --> 22:10.083
flower will it become a fruit?

22:10.417 --> 22:13.959
It’s a living process for which we cannot pay,

22:14.166 --> 22:15.500
it doesn’t understand money.

22:15.834 --> 22:17.542
Living processes do not understand money.

22:17.834 --> 22:19.291
I’ve not known any human being,

22:19.542 --> 22:21.667
supposing he’s suffering from indigestion,

22:21.875 --> 22:23.750
he’ll put some money there saying that “Now I pay you,

22:23.875 --> 22:26.083
my stomach, now will you digest my food?”

22:26.417 --> 22:27.625
Do we do like that?

22:27.834 --> 22:32.041
In the same way it is the highest of highest living processes

22:32.375 --> 22:36.667
for which you cannot pay.

22:36.959 --> 22:39.667
It’s a very subtle thing to understand for human beings

22:39.875 --> 22:43.166
because they believe that for everything one has to pay,

22:43.375 --> 22:44.999
otherwise it doesn’t work out.

22:45.208 --> 22:48.625
You see you go to a machine, you want to have a good,

22:48.959 --> 22:50.792
say, machine, you must pay.

22:51.041 --> 22:53.625
Which works, you see. If doesn’t work, you can have free.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.417
But the one that works we have to pay.

22:56.667 --> 23:00.291
Any motorcar, it’s free, means it’s all a junk, you can’t have it.

23:00.500 --> 23:03.208
We have to pay to take it to the junk shop, so it is

23:03.667 --> 23:08.875
always in the minds of human beings that one has to pay.

23:09.166 --> 23:12.083
And this is very wrong, that you cannot pay.

23:12.291 --> 23:17.999
I’m talking of the processes, which are beyond human,

23:18.208 --> 23:20.208
the human beings are not doing it.

23:20.542 --> 23:23.333
For example we cannot transform a flower into fruit,

23:23.667 --> 23:26.959
the living process itself is beyond human reach.

23:27.083 --> 23:31.667
But when you become, when you become

23:31.875 --> 23:35.041
a superhuman you can handle them.

23:35.291 --> 23:36.542
And this should happen to you.

23:36.959 --> 23:38.959
If it has does not happen to you all the rest

23:39.166 --> 23:40.792
of the things are wrong.

23:41.083 --> 23:44.999
I’m telling you with great concern because the people who

23:45.166 --> 23:49.333
are in the market, who are selling goods,

23:49.625 --> 23:51.667
are doing it very well.

23:51.999 --> 23:54.792
They know how to entice you, they know how to put

23:55.083 --> 23:58.792
ideas through you, how to give you misidentifications, and you

23:59.083 --> 24:06.542
just get identified with them till they completely drop out.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.166
And then you are left high and dry.

24:08.417 --> 24:12.625
You say, “Oh, God, what has happened?”

24:12.875 --> 24:17.041
One thing is there, that your Spirit is not lost.

24:17.333 --> 24:20.166
It is there. Despite whatever the mistakes,

24:20.417 --> 24:25.625
whatever may be the seeking, but the Spirit resides within

24:25.875 --> 24:29.750
you despite everything, till you live.

24:30.083 --> 24:33.625
And this Spirit is to be brought into your conscious mind,

24:33.917 --> 24:37.208
means into your central nervous system,

24:37.458 --> 24:41.625
you should feel the powers of the Spirit in your being.

24:41.792 --> 24:43.999
This is what is Sahaja Yoga is. Sahaja,

24:44.208 --> 24:47.333
as he must have told you, means born with you.

24:47.625 --> 24:49.750
Now, yesterday I told you about the left side,

24:50.041 --> 24:53.291
which is the power of desire, and through this power

24:53.625 --> 24:58.041
we have our all conditionings and all the reception

24:58.291 --> 25:02.750
from the matter, materialistic things and also what you can

25:02.999 --> 25:07.291
say we collect all our past, the past then  extend up

25:07.542 --> 25:08.917
through the collective subconscious.

25:09.083 --> 25:12.041
I also told you yesterday that cancer is a disease caused

25:12.208 --> 25:15.875
by the left side extreme behavior of people.

25:16.041 --> 25:18.542
Those who go into the extreme behavior on the left side

25:18.792 --> 25:22.999
get the disease called cancer and it can be cured if you can

25:23.208 --> 25:26.166
bring such an extreme case in the center,

25:26.417 --> 25:29.333
it can be cured, no doubt about it.

25:29.667 --> 25:34.792
Now, the second part is the right side which today I have

25:34.999 --> 25:36.333
told that I will tell you about.

25:36.583 --> 25:38.667
The gentleman is not here who asked

25:38.999 --> 25:42.083
so many questions, is he here?

25:42.333 --> 25:44.667
He was just busy asking questions, that’s all, yesterday.

25:44.917 --> 25:46.999
He’s not interested in seeking, I think.

25:47.291 --> 25:49.792
All right, now the second side on the right hand side,

25:49.999 --> 25:52.917
is the power by which we act.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.333
First we desire and then we act.

25:55.667 --> 25:58.417
Now this power, right side power, is expressed within

25:58.667 --> 26:01.999
us as right sympathetic nervous system.

26:02.166 --> 26:04.750
Science has come from the same, science is in the gross,

26:05.083 --> 26:07.667
these are all subtle things that are within us.

26:07.917 --> 26:10.458
Now this right side power which exists within us,

26:10.750 --> 26:16.458
gives us the power for our mental and physical capacity to act.

26:16.792 --> 26:19.417
Now this action takes place when we desire something,

26:19.667 --> 26:23.999
we want to implement that desire then we go into action.

26:24.208 --> 26:27.542
One has to understand what sort of a power is this.

26:27.917 --> 26:31.083
This power is called as prana shakti in Sanskrit.

26:31.333 --> 26:34.917
Prana, and the another one, the left one as mana shakti

26:35.166 --> 26:39.417
is the power of the emotions or can say of the mind,

26:39.667 --> 26:42.999
but you see English language is not so clear-cut about it.

26:43.125 --> 26:46.125
So I would say mana shakti and the prana shakti,

26:46.417 --> 26:48.999
these are the two powers that exist within us and we start

26:49.166 --> 26:54.333
using them as left and right, we can say like a brake and an

26:54.542 --> 26:58.542
accelerator and then we become the master of driving.

26:58.750 --> 27:01.792
But while becoming that we make mistakes.

27:01.999 --> 27:05.458
The human mind has a speciality to go to extremes.

27:05.625 --> 27:08.583
Supposing I tell somebody, “Now, you have to meditate.”

27:08.750 --> 27:09.917
They’ll meditate for five hours.

27:10.041 --> 27:12.709
There is no need to meditate for five hours or anything.

27:12.959 --> 27:15.166
But if you tell them that you have to stand on your head,

27:15.458 --> 27:16.959
they’ll do it for ten hours.

27:17.166 --> 27:18.750
So there is no need to go to extremes,

27:18.999 --> 27:21.709
we have to be just in the center, be kind to our body,

27:22.041 --> 27:23.375
be kind to ourselves.

27:23.625 --> 27:26.709
There’s nothing to be frantic about; there’s nothing to be

27:26.999 --> 27:30.250
so much exasperated about it.

27:30.500 --> 27:34.375
It’s just very simple thing that has to happen to you.

27:34.583 --> 27:37.834
For example, think of a seed which is sown in a very

27:38.125 --> 27:42.500
loud music or, say, a place where everybody is rushing,

27:42.750 --> 27:45.625
shouting, screaming, what will happen to that seed,

27:45.834 --> 27:47.041
will never sprout.

27:47.250 --> 27:50.458
If it is in a peaceful place, is a properly placed one,

27:50.750 --> 27:56.250
or not in a tilted pot, then it will definitely develop into

27:56.583 --> 28:00.834
a beautiful tree or a beautiful shrub,

28:01.125 --> 28:02.917
whatever it has to develop into.

28:03.125 --> 28:06.375
In the same way if we are too much on the extremes,

28:06.625 --> 28:08.709
we go to the left and to the right.

28:08.959 --> 28:11.250
Now going to the left, I told you yesterday what happens

28:11.583 --> 28:16.458
that all these things like hypnosis, and ESP’s and most

28:16.709 --> 28:18.375
of these gurus try these tricks, you see,

28:18.625 --> 28:23.999
like they just make you hypnotized and people become

28:24.250 --> 28:28.041
absolutely mad towards the guru, “He’s our guru,” and

28:28.291 --> 28:32.625
they behave just like absolutely people without any brains.

28:32.917 --> 28:35.583
“Oh, I feel nice with that guru.” The reason is that

28:35.875 --> 28:39.291
you feel there’s a sort of a sense of security built-in in

28:39.500 --> 28:43.834
this gentleman and, “if I’m following him, you see,

28:44.041 --> 28:46.125
he is going to Heaven and I’m going with him to Heaven.”

28:46.375 --> 28:48.166
It doesn’t happen like that.

28:48.458 --> 28:51.041
You have to individually go into Heaven yourself and you

28:51.375 --> 28:53.041
have to become your own guru and you have

28:53.291 --> 28:54.709
to know everything about it.

28:54.959 --> 29:00.166
It’s not that anybody can put a trailer behind and put some

29:00.500 --> 29:01.583
people into it and say,

29:01.834 --> 29:02.999
“Now come along, I’m going to Heaven.”

29:03.291 --> 29:05.999
Most of these are people are really going to Hell and you

29:06.250 --> 29:09.041
will follow them very fast.

29:09.291 --> 29:13.166
So it is never so, believe Me, that anybody who says that

29:13.375 --> 29:14.959
following a certain guru you’ll go to

29:15.125 --> 29:17.583
Heaven is absolutely wrong.

29:17.875 --> 29:20.583
You must follow in the Principle and every guru who

29:20.834 --> 29:23.166
is a real guru will always tell you,

29:23.500 --> 29:26.709
will always tell you that you have to become something.

29:26.959 --> 29:29.291
He’ll never just say, “All right, you’ve given me the money,

29:29.583 --> 29:32.500
all right, you are the member, now you are my child,

29:32.750 --> 29:35.458
now you are my disciple and I give you my love.

29:35.750 --> 29:38.166
Let’s have love.” Where is the love? “

29:39.625 --> 29:41.500
And give more money, give me Rolls Royces,

29:41.959 --> 29:43.250
give me this, give me that.”

29:43.583 --> 29:46.375
And like mad we are doing it thinking that

29:46.625 --> 29:49.999
we can exchange these things.

29:50.250 --> 29:53.375
Now, as we are seekers we have every right to find

29:53.709 --> 29:56.750
our Spirits and we are not to be deluded by any such

29:56.999 --> 30:00.166
tricks and pranks of these people or I would say very

30:00.500 --> 30:02.375
sinister methods that they are employing.

30:02.709 --> 30:04.999
Not only to initiate you for money, I don’t mind

30:05.250 --> 30:06.583
they are smugglers, let them have money,

30:06.834 --> 30:08.583
what they want to have; but they spoil your chances

30:08.875 --> 30:10.959
of Realization which you do not realize.

30:11.166 --> 30:14.375
And once they are spoilt, it’s very difficult to give

30:14.709 --> 30:16.709
you Realization, and if you do not really,

30:16.875 --> 30:21.875
positively work it out it’s going to be impossible situation.

30:22.250 --> 30:25.959
I’ve seen people who have suffered on account of this.

30:26.250 --> 30:29.999
Now this action within us acts for our mental and physical

30:30.291 --> 30:32.999
capacities on the right hand side.

30:33.250 --> 30:35.875
Like we think of the future, now the planning will start,

30:36.166 --> 30:38.625
this planning, “Now we must do this tomorrow, or day after

30:38.875 --> 30:40.709
tomorrow we have to do it.” and we start sitting,

30:40.959 --> 30:43.500
“Now, I’ll go there and I’ll find this and then I’ll take

30:43.750 --> 30:45.834
a ticket and then I’ll go there.”

30:46.125 --> 30:48.125
I mean, our mind is working for the future.

30:48.375 --> 30:52.500
So much so, we, we become absolutely futuristic,

30:52.834 --> 30:55.750
to such an extent sometimes I’ve met people who are futuristic,

30:55.999 --> 30:58.625
they even forget their own names. Can you believe it?

30:58.875 --> 31:00.417
I mean they don’t even remember their father’s name.

31:00.709 --> 31:02.750
That’s all right, but even their own names they forget.

31:02.999 --> 31:05.875
I mean they are like mad people because they don’t remember

31:06.125 --> 31:07.417
their own names and they don’t know

31:07.709 --> 31:10.291
where are they, what are they doing.

31:10.542 --> 31:13.834
I have met people of that kind who are really sick people

31:14.041 --> 31:17.166
because they have become so futuristic now that they

31:17.417 --> 31:20.166
do not know anything about their past.

31:20.500 --> 31:25.250
Now this futuristic behavior starts in a society where

31:25.500 --> 31:27.542
people always think of the future.

31:27.834 --> 31:30.625
“What will I do, what am I to do tomorrow,

31:30.875 --> 31:32.083
what am I to achieve tomorrow?”

31:32.709 --> 31:34.709
And all these things, when they start doing

31:35.999 --> 31:38.083
their attention goes to the right extreme.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.999
Now, in this place we are very dangerously placed,

31:42.291 --> 31:45.041
very dangerously placed, when we start looking for the

31:45.291 --> 31:53.750
future and the future seeing is a imaginary stuff,

31:54.041 --> 31:58.542
is absolutely imaginary, because what you think

31:58.875 --> 32:02.875
of the future doesn’t exist. What exists is the present,

32:03.166 --> 32:05.875
you have to be in the present not in the future.

32:06.166 --> 32:09.959
But people will say you have to be in the present, but how?

32:11.250 --> 32:14.625
We cannot. Either we are in the past or in the future.

32:14.875 --> 32:18.250
Because when the thought wave rises, it comes up and goes down.

32:18.542 --> 32:22.291
Another thought wave rises, goes up and comes down.

32:22.625 --> 32:25.250
Now, this thought wave which comes up,

32:25.500 --> 32:27.875
we go with it but we don’t see it’s going down.

32:28.083 --> 32:30.999
Another thought wave that rises, we see that but

32:31.291 --> 32:32.834
don’t see where it goes out.

32:33.041 --> 32:35.250
And so we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts

32:35.500 --> 32:38.834
and we do not know, perhaps we are with the past

32:39.041 --> 32:42.375
or perhaps with the future. But in the center of these two

32:42.834 --> 32:45.375
thoughts there is the present and we don’t know

32:45.667 --> 32:48.667
how to take our attention there, which is a very difficult thing

32:48.959 --> 32:52.959
and just to say that you should be in the center is not possible.

32:53.208 --> 32:55.500
All these things, “You should do this, you should do that,”

32:55.750 --> 32:58.625
is not going to work out unless and until there is light.

32:58.875 --> 33:01.625
For example, there is no light in this room and you say,

33:01.875 --> 33:04.208
“Walk straight,” you cannot walk because you can’t see

33:04.542 --> 33:06.041
where is the passage, how to walk.

33:06.291 --> 33:08.041
Even if you order, do whatever you please,

33:08.291 --> 33:11.291
you cannot just walk straight without touching any of these

33:11.542 --> 33:14.375
chairs because there is no light, you can’t see.

33:14.792 --> 33:17.542
So one has to understand that in the

33:17.875 --> 33:20.417
futuristic life when we live and we plan too

33:20.667 --> 33:23.166
much for the future, actually what we are doing,

33:23.500 --> 33:25.750
we are living in an imaginary world.

33:26.500 --> 33:28.667
We have many stories of people who lived in imaginary

33:28.959 --> 33:33.375
worlds and how they found that everything was destroyed.

33:33.667 --> 33:37.792
And there are people who work it out through their

33:38.041 --> 33:40.542
physical efforts, and when they go into their physical

33:40.834 --> 33:44.333
efforts they create another problem for them because

33:44.625 --> 33:48.083
they just become physically oriented people.

33:48.417 --> 33:50.750
And if you are just physically oriented,

33:51.041 --> 33:53.417
the Spirit gets angry with you.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.625
So the right side movement is for the people who

33:56.875 --> 33:59.500
are very meticulous, you see, which you can call the people

33:59.750 --> 34:02.500
who are very particular about the time and who are very

34:02.750 --> 34:07.417
firm about things, who are very dry people and who are very

34:07.625 --> 34:10.750
straight and they won’t tolerate any nonsense.

34:10.999 --> 34:13.417
One sort of people, you see, that you find normally and

34:13.625 --> 34:17.542
that sort of people become a headache and

34:17.750 --> 34:19.917
they are very boring, you see.

34:20.291 --> 34:21.625
You can’t just bear their company,

34:21.875 --> 34:23.625
they can be very boring people.

34:23.875 --> 34:25.792
And they give you big lectures about how to be

34:26.041 --> 34:28.917
straightforward and how to walk straight absolutely.

34:29.291 --> 34:33.083
In the nature nothing is straight, it all moves so

34:33.333 --> 34:37.083
beautifully because the nature is created out of varieties,

34:37.333 --> 34:38.959
and variety brings the beauty.

34:39.166 --> 34:41.333
They don’t think of beauty, they don’t think of love,

34:41.625 --> 34:44.625
of compassion, nothing. For them it is a very meticulous

34:44.875 --> 34:46.917
world and that’s how they live.

34:47.166 --> 34:51.417
Such people are developing a big ego within themselves,

34:51.750 --> 34:57.333
as you see there, is a yellow stuff in the head called as ego.

34:57.750 --> 35:03.208
By the action of the left side, emotional side,

35:03.542 --> 35:06.166
we develop a superego, but by the action of the right side

35:06.542 --> 35:11.542
we develop a ego. Now this ego is not easy to be seen.

35:11.792 --> 35:14.667
Because if you have a superego you have pains

35:14.917 --> 35:18.208
in the body, you are a miserable person, you have wrinkles

35:18.458 --> 35:21.875
on the face and you look absolutely worn out.

35:22.083 --> 35:25.208
But if you have ego then you look so dynamic.

35:25.500 --> 35:29.458
We can say that Hitler was the extreme of this ego business.

35:29.750 --> 35:34.166
And he got into his head that he is some sort of a god

35:34.458 --> 35:37.083
incarnation and that he has to save the people,

35:37.417 --> 35:40.792
and he was the one who knows about races and everything

35:41.041 --> 35:44.917
and he is supposed to save some race.

35:45.166 --> 35:48.542
This kind of idea comes from these people who

35:48.875 --> 35:52.875
are right sided, they are very aggressive, they may be very

35:53.083 --> 35:56.875
good to talk to, they may be very humble to look at,

35:57.542 --> 36:00.166
could be very good business men, could be anything,

36:00.417 --> 36:03.208
but they do not know that they have this Mister Ego

36:03.542 --> 36:06.333
coming up on their heads just like a big balloon

36:06.625 --> 36:09.917
and they are floating in the air. The end of ego is stupidity.

36:10.166 --> 36:12.750
You’ll be surprised, the end of ego is stupidity.

36:12.999 --> 36:16.166
Such people indulge into all kinds of stupid things,

36:16.417 --> 36:18.417
and they say, “What’s wrong?”

36:18.667 --> 36:21.917
For example I’ve known old people behaving in so

36:22.208 --> 36:24.750
stupid ways, and they say, “What’s wrong?”

36:24.999 --> 36:26.917
You know, an old man, say of ninety years,

36:27.208 --> 36:30.999
Who can’t even walk without a stick, takes to these dances you

36:31.208 --> 36:33.999
do and then he falls down, you see, and

36:34.333 --> 36:36.999
he thinks, “what’s wrong?” Like a lady I knew, she was

36:37.291 --> 36:41.166
about eighty-five, she died from a horse falling down.

36:41.333 --> 36:44.208
Naturally I mean what else you expect at eighty-five,

36:44.458 --> 36:46.917
that’s what is evident, for a lady of eighty-five she should

36:47.166 --> 36:49.792
settle down at home, look after her grandchildren,

36:49.999 --> 36:51.999
maybe she might have great grandchildren, you see.

36:52.291 --> 36:54.291
Instead of that why does she want to be twenty-five-year-old

36:54.583 --> 36:57.333
lady to climb on a horse?

36:57.542 --> 37:01.083
So all such stupid things they do and then they will say,

37:01.291 --> 37:04.208
“What’s wrong?” Is nothing wrong in stupidity, what’s wrong?

37:04.542 --> 37:10.083
But such people are a nuisance to the society, to others.

37:10.417 --> 37:13.999
The people who are superego are troublesome to themselves,

37:14.291 --> 37:18.458
but those are egoistical are troublesome to others.

37:18.750 --> 37:21.750
They are all the time correcting others, torturing others,

37:21.999 --> 37:25.667
putting their ideas on to other people, and such people

37:25.917 --> 37:28.792
can be very, very successful because nothing

37:29.083 --> 37:30.583
succeeds like success.

37:30.875 --> 37:34.208
They go on hammering things into the heads of people,

37:34.458 --> 37:36.417
saying, “Now this is true, this is true,”

37:36.667 --> 37:38.875
and when you go on saying it, this you suddenly believe,

37:39.083 --> 37:42.583
“Yes, must be so.” And such people are much more dangerous

37:42.917 --> 37:44.792
I would say from the superego type.

37:44.999 --> 37:48.875
But for people who do not know the tricks of the

37:48.999 --> 37:55.917
superego they can be very, very, very dangerous because

37:56.458 --> 38:00.291
they are very subtle, you cannot see them, they mesmerize,

38:00.583 --> 38:06.083
and they can possess you and they can be very sly, and they can

38:06.333 --> 38:09.917
work out all sorts of methods which you are not aware.

38:10.125 --> 38:14.583
So it is not easy to choose which is better, which is not better.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.542
Both things are wrong to go to extremes,

38:17.709 --> 38:20.083
on the right or to the left.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.458
Now let’s see what happens physically.

38:22.917 --> 38:25.999
As I told about the cancer on the left hand side that we do,

38:26.291 --> 38:29.125
physically what happens to people who are futuristic?

38:29.333 --> 38:32.333
We have a center specially for futuristic behavior

38:32.583 --> 38:35.875
called as Swadhisthana Chakra which is in the gross

38:36.417 --> 38:41.125
manifesting the plexus called the aortic plexus within us.

38:41.458 --> 38:44.125
Now this Swadhisthana Chakra is very important for human

38:44.417 --> 38:48.250
beings, specially for people who are developed people.

38:48.542 --> 38:52.999
With this chakra actually we convert the fat of the stomach

38:53.208 --> 38:55.250
for the use of the brain.

38:55.542 --> 38:59.999
Now this is the center of the Surya, of the sun.

39:00.250 --> 39:04.333
Now when we start thinking, these cells are converted

39:04.999 --> 39:08.917
in such a way that they become useful to the brain.

39:09.125 --> 39:12.458
Now, if you are thinking all the time, all the time

39:12.667 --> 39:14.458
you are thinking, then what will happen?

39:14.999 --> 39:17.208
I mean the horns are not going to grow out of that.

39:17.458 --> 39:20.999
You are consuming all that, and then you are consuming

39:21.208 --> 39:24.458
all those cells, you have to have replacement,

39:24.709 --> 39:28.208
and for that replacement this Swadhisthana Chakra has to work

39:28.458 --> 39:33.709
very hard to convert the cells for the use of your brain.

39:33.999 --> 39:38.125
Now, when it is doing that there are other things which this

39:38.542 --> 39:41.917
Swadhisthana Chakra has to look after; for example your liver,

39:42.208 --> 39:47.792
your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys, all are to be looked

39:48.125 --> 39:53.417
after by this center, and also uterus for the ladies.

39:53.667 --> 39:56.709
Now, when there’s only one work is given to this

39:56.917 --> 40:00.458
Swadhisthan Chakra and it cannot do any other work,

40:00.709 --> 40:03.083
then other things are neglected, so you develop a

40:03.250 --> 40:06.583
terrible disease called liver trouble.

40:07.417 --> 40:10.542
Now liver trouble is another thing that you do not feel yourself.

40:10.792 --> 40:12.709
Others know that you are liverish the way you are

40:12.999 --> 40:18.583
hot tempered, the way you are fussy, the way you always

40:18.834 --> 40:25.667
snarl at people and the way you are never satisfied

40:25.917 --> 40:28.333
with anything, the way you criticize others;

40:28.583 --> 40:32.999
all this is liverish and such liverish people are never happy

40:33.208 --> 40:36.208
with themselves because liver looks after your attention.

40:36.458 --> 40:39.458
And those who have liver problems, their attention is horrid,

40:39.709 --> 40:41.458
that goes like this, you see, you cannot keep

40:41.709 --> 40:44.250
your attention straight. On the street you’ll walk straight

40:44.542 --> 40:46.709
into a car because you are looking at something which

40:46.959 --> 40:48.125
you are not supposed to look.

40:48.375 --> 40:49.834
But all the time you are looking at like this,

40:50.083 --> 40:52.333
you cannot walk, I mean you won’t find any animal like

40:52.583 --> 40:55.333
that who walks like this, but only human beings do it.

40:55.583 --> 40:57.083
If you see them on the street you’ll be amazed.

40:57.333 --> 40:59.375
Where are they walking? They don’t walk straight,

40:59.709 --> 41:01.792
they don’t look straight, but their eyes are going this way,

41:01.959 --> 41:03.709
that way, because the attention is wobbly,

41:03.959 --> 41:06.667
the attention is wobbly because of a bad liver.

41:06.917 --> 41:09.834
So this liver is a very, very important thing.

41:10.208 --> 41:15.667
Now, this liver has a special capacity to extract all the poisons

41:15.917 --> 41:20.125
from the body as heat, and the heat in the body is to be

41:20.375 --> 41:25.709
transformed or should be conveyed to the blood,

41:25.917 --> 41:28.834
or the water in the blood, and that has to be taken out

41:29.083 --> 41:33.250
of your body maybe as perspiration or in another forms.

41:33.583 --> 41:36.083
But what happens that when this liver is

41:36.333 --> 41:40.959
out of gear it cannot do it, it cannot pass this heat into

41:41.250 --> 41:43.709
the blood stream and the heat remains in the body

41:43.959 --> 41:47.458
and you really become heated and that

41:47.709 --> 41:51.792
heat makes all these problems for you.

41:52.083 --> 41:56.458
So in Sahaja Yoga what happens that when Kundalini rises,

41:56.709 --> 42:00.375
She changes the form of the blood.

42:01.458 --> 42:04.999
The hydrogen and oxygen which are placed because

42:05.250 --> 42:09.333
of this heat and all that in a very funny way, like this,

42:09.583 --> 42:12.709
get like that and they start receiving this heat within them.

42:12.959 --> 42:15.375
That’s why those people who have bad livers feel

42:15.667 --> 42:17.458
little heat when the Kundalini rises.

42:17.792 --> 42:20.500
But one can cure it by giving it that peace

42:20.792 --> 42:24.375
and comfort to that liver organ, and you can definitely

42:24.709 --> 42:26.959
cure your liver, no doubt about it.

42:27.250 --> 42:30.333
Then the second thing that happens to you is

42:30.709 --> 42:34.500
the pancreas which gives you diabetes.

42:34.792 --> 42:37.333
Only a person who thinks too much gets the diabetes.

42:37.583 --> 42:40.709
For example, an Indian farmer doesn’t know what diabetes is.

42:40.959 --> 42:42.917
But then you stop your sugar, but that’s not the

42:43.125 --> 42:45.792
way to stop your diabetes. Diabetes comes to you because

42:45.999 --> 42:47.999
you think, think, think, think, think, too much.

42:48.333 --> 42:50.375
The doctors won’t understand this, that’s why they say it

42:50.625 --> 42:52.959
is incurable, because they cannot connect

42:53.208 --> 42:54.834
thinking with the disease.

42:55.125 --> 42:57.125
And this is what happens when you are all the time

42:57.458 --> 43:00.250
thinking like mad, then diabetes takes place.

43:00.583 --> 43:05.166
And this diabetes is also curable if you get your enlightenment.

43:05.625 --> 43:08.041
You can cure also the diabetes of other people,

43:08.250 --> 43:11.583
but because this vital power, which is integrated of all

43:11.834 --> 43:16.125
these three powers flows through you and you can replenish,

43:16.333 --> 43:21.333
you can give more to other people who are exhausted of it,

43:21.709 --> 43:25.583
and sort of you can fill them up with this power and you can cure.

43:25.917 --> 43:27.999
But the third one is the worst of all that happens to people

43:28.333 --> 43:30.834
is blood cancer, because of spleen.

43:31.125 --> 43:33.125
Spleen is one thing very important,

43:33.375 --> 43:37.458
that it is the center of peace within us.

43:37.709 --> 43:39.792
The one who doesn’t have a proper spleen

43:40.041 --> 43:41.917
cannot be peaceful person.

43:42.166 --> 43:45.583
Now, it’s a very simple thing but doctors cannot connect it,

43:45.834 --> 43:48.792
nor all science-oriented people can connect it,

43:48.999 --> 43:51.166
to something very, very simple.

43:51.458 --> 43:54.959
And the simple thing is that when we eat our food,

43:55.166 --> 44:00.834
if we are frantic we are out to get trouble with the spleen,

44:01.375 --> 44:03.917
and we can get blood cancer.

44:04.250 --> 44:07.041
Now if the mother is of that temperament or a father is of that

44:07.333 --> 44:11.583
temperament, the children might be born with blood cancer.

44:11.917 --> 44:16.375
Now, we’ll be happy to tell you that in New York we had a case

44:16.583 --> 44:20.792
of blood cancer and when I was in India, in a village,

44:20.999 --> 44:23.583
somebody came and told Me that such and such boy is sick,

44:23.959 --> 44:26.125
he’s only sixteen years with blood cancer and doctors have

44:26.333 --> 44:28.999
declared that he’s going to die within two weeks’ time.

44:29.250 --> 44:32.041
They always declare, they are good at declaration only.

44:32.375 --> 44:35.999
And when this case came to Me, I told them that

44:36.166 --> 44:38.250
“I cannot do anything, I’m in a village, but you can

44:38.500 --> 44:40.375
telephone to one of the Sahaja Yoginis.

44:40.625 --> 44:43.709
She was in England, now she is in New York

44:43.999 --> 44:45.709
and she will look after this case.”

44:45.959 --> 44:48.625
You’ll be amazed that the boy was cured completely,

44:48.917 --> 44:50.834
he came out of the hospital, he came to see Me and now

44:51.125 --> 44:52.999
he’s gone back to his studies.

44:53.250 --> 44:55.375
I mean, it’s like this, we have cured many cases

44:55.709 --> 45:00.917
of blood cancer, but here we are not to cure people by any…

45:01.125 --> 45:03.166
or healing anyone, that’s not our job.

45:03.500 --> 45:06.125
It happens spontaneously as a by-product

45:06.375 --> 45:07.917
of the Kundalini awakening.

45:08.125 --> 45:09.999
Main thing is we have to make you doctors,

45:10.375 --> 45:12.250
we have to make you knowledgeable people,

45:12.500 --> 45:16.333
we have to make you collectively conscious human beings

45:16.709 --> 45:19.125
who have to enter into the Kingdom of God,

45:19.750 --> 45:22.834
to reside there in His peace, bliss and joy.

45:24.875 --> 45:28.999
Now this trouble of also of kidney, of high blood pressure,

45:29.250 --> 45:32.999
all that is due to this. People worry, they are frantic,

45:33.250 --> 45:35.291
you see, and this franticness comes to us

45:35.583 --> 45:37.375
just as a matter of habit. I’ve known people,

45:37.750 --> 45:39.250
as soon as you say,

45:39.500 --> 45:42.959
“Oh, you have to go by aeroplane somewhere,”

45:43.125 --> 45:46.166
suddenly the aeroplane word triggers that frantic, “Oh!”

45:46.500 --> 45:49.291
They get mad. They don’t know what they are up to.

45:49.542 --> 45:51.750
They’ll forget their passport, they will forget their luggage,

45:51.999 --> 45:53.834
they’ll forget this, they are frantic.

45:53.999 --> 45:56.959
At the airport if you go you’ll find this left Nabhi as we call

45:57.125 --> 46:00.959
this center is, the spleen goes frantic.

46:01.166 --> 46:06.041
Now, when you eat your food or do any such work there

46:06.291 --> 46:08.625
is an emergency created and more blood

46:08.875 --> 46:12.750
is needed to digest that food. So this spleen, poor thing,

46:12.959 --> 46:19.291
works very hard to create that extra amount of blood cells.

46:19.542 --> 46:22.625
But at the time you are eating, you are also, say,

46:22.834 --> 46:24.375
reading a newspaper, that’s the worst thing

46:24.542 --> 46:26.750
one should do in the morning. Horrible.

46:27.083 --> 46:29.500
You read the newspaper, you are eating the food,

46:29.834 --> 46:33.500
your spleen goes off because another emergency comes up.

46:33.750 --> 46:36.834
Then you get on to your bicycle with a sandwich in the hand,

46:37.083 --> 46:41.250
is even worse than that. And you are rushing to your work,

46:41.542 --> 46:43.500
suddenly you find a big jam on the way,

46:43.750 --> 46:47.041
then you are even very badly placed with the situation,

46:47.291 --> 46:49.291
and you get so frantic and you don’t understand.

46:49.625 --> 46:51.542
And the person who is in front of you go on saying,

46:51.834 --> 46:54.083
“What’s wrong with this fellow, why can’t he drive fast?”

46:54.375 --> 46:57.875
and the same fellow is saying something exactly the same

46:58.083 --> 47:00.625
to the another fellow who is going ahead.

47:00.834 --> 47:03.625
So this madness is on, this rat race is on and if you are

47:03.875 --> 47:08.709
eating your food in such a hurry and with such franticness,

47:09.166 --> 47:11.999
you develop this trouble which is very dangerous called

47:12.250 --> 47:17.083
as blood cancer, and among young people is very common.

47:17.667 --> 47:23.999
Now, the last and not the least is the trouble of the heart.

47:25.667 --> 47:29.500
When you pay too much attention to all these outward things,

47:30.250 --> 47:35.417
to material things, to your all material advancement,

47:35.875 --> 47:40.250
to your physical advancement and to so much of a

47:40.500 --> 47:42.875
computerization of your brain, then you neglect the

47:44.041 --> 47:47.417
necessary attention to your Spirit which resides

47:47.750 --> 47:53.083
in your heart; and so the Spirit recedes, and when the Spirit

47:53.375 --> 47:55.750
recedes you get a heart attack.

47:56.041 --> 47:58.750
Only a person who is right sided gets a heart attack,

47:58.999 --> 48:01.041
and never a person who is a left sided.

48:01.375 --> 48:06.083
I told this to a doctor and he told, surprisingly,

48:06.291 --> 48:11.500
that in a mental hospital you never need a cardiogram,

48:11.792 --> 48:14.500
you do not need it.  They never get a heart attack.

48:14.834 --> 48:17.041
A mad man never gets a heart attack, surprisingly.

48:17.417 --> 48:22.792
A person who is mad is using his heart, his left side,

48:23.083 --> 48:25.667
his emotions and his heart should go out, but no,

48:25.959 --> 48:27.750
his brain goes out. Can you imagine?

48:27.999 --> 48:30.875
And the one who uses the brain, his heart goes out.

48:31.083 --> 48:33.667
This is a balance created by the nature in us.

48:33.959 --> 48:37.291
See how cleverly the nature is trying to guide us

48:37.625 --> 48:40.792
in the center: don’t go to the extremes, keep to the center,

48:41.041 --> 48:45.500
keep to the center, and then when you are absolutely

48:45.792 --> 48:51.959
in the center, then you get your evolution very quickly.

48:52.208 --> 48:55.417
So this is the right side that we have, the futuristic side,

48:55.667 --> 48:59.959
and as you know we are all very futuristic by temperament.

49:00.667 --> 49:03.417
This futuristicness cannot be cured by telling,

49:03.667 --> 49:05.959
“Oh, now, don’t think,” you cannot do it,

49:06.166 --> 49:08.542
you just cannot do it. If I order you that

49:08.875 --> 49:12.041
“Now, you better stop planning,” you just can’t do it,

49:12.291 --> 49:15.208
you can’t help it. You have to do that kind of planning.

49:15.542 --> 49:18.291
And you find all these plans fail because these plans

49:18.625 --> 49:21.083
are not related to the plans of the Divine.

49:21.333 --> 49:24.542
Divine has some other plans while you have some other plans

49:24.792 --> 49:28.333
and they never combine together, and that’s how you find

49:28.625 --> 49:31.208
all your plans fail and you are just frustrated,

49:31.500 --> 49:32.542
left high and dry.

49:32.792 --> 49:35.208
You don’t understand how it has happened.

49:35.750 --> 49:39.625
For your understanding, one has to know that

49:39.792 --> 49:44.875
there is a Divine Power.  You may like it or not.

49:45.083 --> 49:47.875
All this living work that is done - millions and millions

49:48.083 --> 49:52.792
flowers which are becoming fruits, a seed becoming a tree,

49:53.041 --> 49:55.291
a particular seed becomes a particular tree,

49:55.542 --> 49:57.208
all the choices that are made, the whole organized way

49:58.917 --> 50:03.291
the chemical acts, the way the chemistry is made

50:03.500 --> 50:06.333
of periodic laws - everything you see in this world

50:06.667 --> 50:09.999
is all so well organized, there has to be somebody doing it.

50:10.291 --> 50:12.917
So there is a Divine Power which is surrounding us,

50:13.166 --> 50:16.667
no doubt about it. But we have not yet felt it, that’s all.

50:16.917 --> 50:19.291
If we have not felt it that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.

50:19.625 --> 50:23.208
It does exist and it works out. We have seen with our own

50:23.458 --> 50:25.917
experience that so many living things are happening.

50:26.166 --> 50:28.041
We just take it for granted, we are not bothered.

50:28.417 --> 50:32.166
See, in human life itself, a child is to be born,

50:32.417 --> 50:35.208
then a fetus is held in the body.

50:35.542 --> 50:38.875
Normally the law of medical science is this:

50:39.083 --> 50:41.166
that anything foreign, if it enters into the body,

50:41.333 --> 50:44.208
is thrown away immediately, all the forces

50:44.542 --> 50:45.792
are built up to throw it away.

50:46.083 --> 50:49.667
But what we find that when a fetus is built up the whole

50:50.041 --> 50:53.333
system works out to nourish it, to look after it,

50:53.750 --> 50:55.291
to really to bother about it.

50:55.625 --> 50:59.208
Very carefully the water is created around it so that

50:59.542 --> 51:02.208
it is not disturbed, and every sort of a care is taken

51:02.458 --> 51:04.291
by the body to look after the fetus,

51:04.625 --> 51:09.542
and when the fetus is ready, it is thrown out.

51:09.792 --> 51:12.333
Who does that? Who does that?

51:12.625 --> 51:14.542
We must ask these questions to ourselves sometimes.

51:14.875 --> 51:18.083
After all why have we become human beings?

51:18.417 --> 51:21.208
What was the need? What was the need?

51:21.458 --> 51:23.542
And if we haven’t got the answer that means we are still in

51:23.792 --> 51:27.999
transition, and we have to get there where we get the answer.

51:28.291 --> 51:33.999
We are made humans beings to feel that Divine Power,

51:34.875 --> 51:37.458
to maneuver that Divine Power and thus

51:37.750 --> 51:43.875
enjoy the bliss of divinity. That Divine Power is

51:44.166 --> 51:47.542
the Collective Being, that gives us collectivity.

51:47.792 --> 51:50.583
The Spirit in our heart is the one which is the

51:50.792 --> 51:53.291
Collective Being within us, which manifests that

51:53.542 --> 51:56.291
Divine Power to flow through us.

51:56.999 --> 51:59.583
And that’s how, once we are connected to the mains,

51:59.999 --> 52:04.917
we start becoming what we are for. Like a machine,

52:05.208 --> 52:08.917
once it is put to the mains it gets its meaning;

52:09.166 --> 52:11.083
but this machine, though it is put to the mains,

52:11.291 --> 52:15.458
is not aware of the electricity, about My voice, anything.

52:15.750 --> 52:19.999
But a human being, when he gets connected with the mains,

52:20.208 --> 52:23.917
then he becomes aware and this is what you must see.

52:24.166 --> 52:28.917
When you get realized you can raise the Kundalini of others,

52:29.291 --> 52:31.125
you can give Realization to others.

52:31.417 --> 52:34.417
Ray himself has done to so many. Even in Riyadh, he did it.

52:34.667 --> 52:36.542
He did it everywhere wherever he went.

52:36.709 --> 52:39.917
He’s just like you, he’s an engineer, he’s just like you,

52:40.166 --> 52:42.542
he was just like you, and now you’ll be amazed that

52:42.875 --> 52:46.333
how much he knows about himself and about others.

52:46.583 --> 52:50.417
And a complete change has come because once you get

52:50.709 --> 52:52.542
the Spirit, when you get the highest,

52:52.792 --> 52:54.750
all these mundane things drop out and you

52:55.083 --> 52:58.542
become a master of yourself. No more enslavement of any

52:58.792 --> 53:01.792
habits or anything, it just works out beautifully.

53:01.999 --> 53:03.917
But one must give a chance to oneself and one

53:04.125 --> 53:08.917
must have patience. The worst part of intelligence, so-called,

53:09.083 --> 53:12.750
is that you can make fun of everything. That’s the easiest way,

53:12.917 --> 53:16.125
to make fun of everything and get rid of it.

53:16.417 --> 53:19.250
In olden times when they wanted to face the reality,

53:19.458 --> 53:21.458
like when Christ came in, they didn’t make fun of Him.

53:21.709 --> 53:24.083
But they did at the time when He was crucified,

53:24.333 --> 53:28.709
but they just denied. But now it is not basically problem,

53:28.999 --> 53:32.417
that problem doesn’t exist because to deny, you see,

53:32.542 --> 53:35.542
it requires more effort, so is better to make fun.

53:35.792 --> 53:39.417
Is stupidity, again as I said, is stupidity to make fun

53:39.583 --> 53:43.792
of something because you are that, you are the Spirit.

53:43.999 --> 53:46.792
You are the one who has to get it and if you just know

53:46.999 --> 53:49.542
how to make fun, please go and play about with it.

53:49.792 --> 53:51.417
All your life you’ll go on, all your lives

53:51.583 --> 53:53.125
you’ll go on, what’s the use?

53:53.417 --> 53:57.083
And if you do not get your Realization,

53:57.583 --> 54:02.208
in the words of your judgment you have failed,

54:02.542 --> 54:05.834
you have failed and there is a chance given to you.

54:06.417 --> 54:10.458
You can be comforted and you can be counseled,

54:10.709 --> 54:14.208
you can be redeemed; but nobody can make you taste

54:14.458 --> 54:18.333
the beauty of your own being, that you have to do it yourself.

54:18.542 --> 54:22.250
If you do not want to do it, all right.  It’s perfectly all right.

54:22.542 --> 54:23.917
You are free to do it, do what you like.

54:24.125 --> 54:28.583
But if you want to do it, then please stop your guru-shopping

54:29.125 --> 54:32.999
and wobbling, stop and see for yourself what you need.

54:33.250 --> 54:35.125
It’s a serious thing, which should happen.

54:35.458 --> 54:37.999
Unless and until human beings are evolved,

54:38.250 --> 54:40.583
none of the problems of the world are going to be solved,

54:40.792 --> 54:42.333
none of the problems, take it from Me.

54:42.667 --> 54:44.792
Whatever they have done by their thinking - say they have

54:44.999 --> 54:49.999
created democracy, they have created communism, this,

54:50.208 --> 54:54.208
that, all this nonsense, has no meaning at all in reality,

54:54.583 --> 54:56.999
it has no meaning. Because, say for example you might say

54:57.333 --> 54:59.834
I’m very powerful so I’m a capitalist.

55:00.125 --> 55:03.125
But I can’t live without giving to others, so I’m a communist.

55:03.375 --> 55:06.999
I’m a complete capitalist and a complete communist.

55:07.208 --> 55:10.834
Everything exists within Me, and these ideas are all artificial

55:10.999 --> 55:13.375
that you make some set of people as democratic

55:13.667 --> 55:14.999
and some people as this thing.

55:15.250 --> 55:18.834
Because as long as they are attached to selfishness, to all

55:19.083 --> 55:22.792
these things, they are not going to do any good job out of it.

55:22.999 --> 55:26.083
Now, the detachment takes place because you become

55:26.333 --> 55:30.458
one with the Spirit, which is not attached,

55:30.792 --> 55:33.792
which gives you that light, that detachment from where

55:34.083 --> 55:37.125
you can see the whole thing just as a drama going on.

55:37.333 --> 55:40.083
And you work it out very well. You become so dynamic,

55:40.250 --> 55:42.667
so dynamic that you are amazed at your own dynamism.

55:43.542 --> 55:46.542
Apart from that, one has to realize if there is a Power,

55:46.917 --> 55:50.542
which is an all-pervading Power, that Power itself thinks,

55:50.792 --> 55:53.250
organizes and looks after you.

55:53.917 --> 55:57.458
So many things have happened to Sahaja Yogis that if

55:57.709 --> 56:00.375
I have to tell you all about it, you’ll be amazed.

56:00.667 --> 56:01.999
Amazing things have happened.

56:02.208 --> 56:05.792
But Krishna has said very clearly, “yogakshema vahamyaham,”

56:05.999 --> 56:10.375
means “When you get the yoga, you’ll get the well being.”

56:10.709 --> 56:14.208
After yoga. He said yoga first, first the union must take place,

56:14.458 --> 56:16.333
then you’ll get the well being.

56:16.583 --> 56:19.125
Now I’ve seen people who go to so-called gurus and things,

56:19.208 --> 56:23.667
sick, you see their faces pale, absolutely finished,

56:23.917 --> 56:26.500
they are good for nothing, absolutely miserable people.

56:26.667 --> 56:29.667
And how such people could be in yoga?

56:29.959 --> 56:32.959
Not only physically, mentally they are at peace,

56:33.083 --> 56:34.542
they are full of compassion and love.

56:34.667 --> 56:37.917
And the compassion that doesn’t talk, but just flows, it flows,

56:38.166 --> 56:41.375
it emits, you can give your compassion even to flowers.

56:41.625 --> 56:44.041
If the flowers are dying, you can give them this and

56:44.208 --> 56:46.417
they will live for a while.  If there are, say,

56:46.667 --> 56:49.291
trees which are dying, if you give them they will prosper.

56:49.500 --> 56:51.333
If you give it to animals, they’ll be different because

56:51.667 --> 56:55.208
first time, after getting this power only, you are giving

56:55.500 --> 56:57.166
back something to the nature.

56:57.417 --> 57:00.083
So far you have been always taking from the nature.

57:00.333 --> 57:01.667
Now it is the first time you start giving

57:01.875 --> 57:04.917
something to the nature. Because the compassion just flows,

57:05.208 --> 57:08.542
it doesn’t receive anything, it just flows to others

57:08.875 --> 57:10.291
and this should happen to you.

57:10.542 --> 57:13.500
Don’t be satisfied with cheap things, with something nonsensical,

57:13.875 --> 57:20.667
which is something sort of a mimicry or a mass ideas.

57:20.875 --> 57:24.792
I am talking of collectivity where every individual is aware.

57:25.083 --> 57:29.999
It’s not a mass activity, it is collectivity. May God bless you.

57:30.166 --> 57:33.917
I hope today many will get Realization and become one

57:34.208 --> 57:36.999
with their Spirits and will feel their collectivity.

57:37.208 --> 57:40.875
That’s only My hope is. Brighton I place very high up in

57:41.083 --> 57:43.917
England and I always said England is the heart of the universe.

57:44.166 --> 57:47.333
It is very important that it is the heart, no doubt,

57:47.625 --> 57:50.542
and that’s why Blake has said that it has to become Jerusalem.

57:50.792 --> 57:52.083
There’s lot of truth in what he has said.

57:52.333 --> 57:54.083
Lots of things he has said about Sahaja Yoga

57:54.333 --> 57:58.875
is absolutely proved. But the heart is sluggish.

57:59.166 --> 58:01.792
Heart is sleeping, is a sad thing.

58:02.083 --> 58:06.875
Like I say that Europe is the liver and it is drinking,

58:07.083 --> 58:09.458
can you imagine what will be the state of affairs of this,

58:09.667 --> 58:13.667
universe, if everything is going against one’s own essence?

58:13.875 --> 58:17.875
And the essence of English is that it is the heart.

58:18.083 --> 58:20.999
That means it articulates, it circulates.

58:21.333 --> 58:23.999
Whatever happens in England is taken up seriously.

58:24.208 --> 58:26.750
Supposing you become, all of you, stupid people,

58:26.999 --> 58:28.208
the whole world will become.

58:28.458 --> 58:30.333
The responsibility is such a lot on you,

58:30.625 --> 58:31.875
which you do not realize.

58:32.083 --> 58:34.333
It’s a very important thing that we are doing.

58:34.667 --> 58:38.208
It looks very small in this country because there are very

58:38.458 --> 58:41.208
few people who really come to Sahaja Yoga and settle down.

58:41.458 --> 58:44.625
Very few people, there are very few of that caliber I think.

58:44.875 --> 58:47.333
Young little children are there, many will come up

58:47.625 --> 58:49.417
by about, say, ten years or so.

58:49.625 --> 58:53.208
I’m sure there will be a very good quality of people

58:53.417 --> 58:55.291
who will be coming and the seekers who are here,

58:55.542 --> 58:58.333
are also sort of little nervous because they want to learn

58:58.583 --> 59:00.417
from Americans and from Europeans.

59:00.667 --> 59:01.917
There’s nothing to be learned from them.

59:02.166 --> 59:04.083
It is you who are going to circulate;

59:04.291 --> 59:05.667
you are going to carry the message.

59:05.917 --> 59:08.999
I know it’s a very important country, and somehow it was

59:09.166 --> 59:11.750
managed that My husband could get his election

59:11.999 --> 59:13.625
done in England and we are here now

59:13.792 --> 59:15.458
for last eight years, can you believe it?

59:15.792 --> 59:20.208
And I’ll be here maybe again four years more, at the most.

59:20.458 --> 59:23.208
So I hope something will happen and this Brighton,

59:23.542 --> 59:28.583
which is a very good place, I’m sure here also many will get

59:28.917 --> 59:31.208
their Realization and will help

59:31.458 --> 59:33.875
in the emancipation of human beings.

59:34.083 --> 59:37.166
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

59:37.417 --> 59:50.083
If you have any questions you must ask Me.

59:50.417 --> 59:53.125
In all frankness I must tell you I’m your Mother;

59:53.417 --> 59:56.583
I never feel offended you ask Me a question.

59:56.875 --> 59:59.291
Is important because, actually, I have no question.

59:59.542 --> 01:00:00.999
You have to ask Me, I have no question at all.
