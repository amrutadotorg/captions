00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:21.083
Oh, I would suggest that first let them ask questions today.

00:05:21.667 --> 00:05:25.458
So I keep myself there…

00:05:25.709 --> 00:05:26.834
If you have any questions,

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:28.834
it's better to ask me first.

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:32.917
So that your mind is at rest.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.458
I'm glad to stand.…better to see people better.

00:05:52.999 --> 00:05:56.208
Am I better here or on the ground?

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:02.917
Now, first of all it’s better to ask the questions

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:09.583
because yesterday when we started this question session

00:06:09.917 --> 00:06:11.333
people got little deviated.

00:06:11.625 --> 00:06:13.583
It’s better to ask questions now, what you have,

00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:15.500
because you are all seekers.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.959
You are all seekers and you have been seeking

00:06:19.208 --> 00:06:21.834
so is best is to ask questions now, so I’ll be able

00:06:22.125 --> 00:06:29.959
to put the answer in between My lecture.

00:07:12.083 --> 00:07:13.625
No questions?

00:07:21.417 --> 00:07:23.959
That means Sahaja Yogis have become quite capable

00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:28.959
of explaining Sahaja Yoga and I’m very proud of them.

00:07:30.959 --> 00:07:33.625
When I went to Australia the newspaper people

00:07:33.875 --> 00:07:37.834
asked Me, “Mother, are all Your disciples scholars?”

00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.959
I said, “No, they are very common people.

00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:42.959
They have to be very common and normal people.”

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.999
But they said, “The way they know things,

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:48.500
surprisingly we feel they are all scholars.”

00:07:48.750 --> 00:07:51.291
I said, “All scholarship is within yourself.”

00:07:51.542 --> 00:07:53.875
All the knowledge is within yourself.

00:07:54.083 --> 00:07:58.709
If you only can get light there, you can see

00:07:58.875 --> 00:08:00.625
all that knowledge is within you.

00:08:00.875 --> 00:08:03.291
You don’t have to go anywhere for your knowledge.

00:08:03.625 --> 00:08:07.083
It’s all inside, everything is built in.

00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:15.375
You are built in so beautifully to become your Spirit

00:08:15.625 --> 00:08:18.875
that I don’t have to do much about it. It just works out.

00:08:19.083 --> 00:08:21.875
Only thing is that one has to know what

00:08:22.083 --> 00:08:25.375
we should expect; to be the Spirit,

00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:27.834
what should be our expectation.

00:08:28.166 --> 00:08:31.041
And that also logically you must understand.

00:08:31.291 --> 00:08:33.959
It should be a logical conclusion.

00:08:34.208 --> 00:08:36.959
Not just because I say something,

00:08:37.208 --> 00:08:39.667
because you have become a member of some group,

00:08:39.999 --> 00:08:41.750
because you have paid money somewhere.

00:08:41.959 --> 00:08:45.625
It’s not that way. Reality is what it is.

00:08:45.875 --> 00:08:49.166
And logically it has to be reality.

00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:58.208
The other day I told you about the left side, about the past,

00:08:58.417 --> 00:09:00.750
about the subconscious, about the collective subconscious

00:09:00.959 --> 00:09:05.750
and the problems of the subconscious and the conditionings

00:09:05.999 --> 00:09:09.542
we get from material things, from matter.

00:09:09.834 --> 00:09:14.291
Matter is always trying to overpower the Spirit.

00:09:15.041 --> 00:09:20.166
And this matter is overpowering us because

00:09:20.417 --> 00:09:23.375
we come from matter to begin with.

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:27.875
But how does the Spirit come out of it?

00:09:28.542 --> 00:09:34.792
What happens that we become the Spirit?

00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:38.625
People have talked about Self Realization.

00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:43.041
So many people have talked about second birth.

00:09:43.417 --> 00:09:46.333
Everyone has said that you are to be born again.

00:09:46.542 --> 00:09:48.333
There are many people who go about saying,

00:09:48.625 --> 00:09:51.500
“I’m twice born,” self certified.

00:09:51.667 --> 00:09:54.417
You can find all kinds of people in this world,

00:09:54.625 --> 00:10:01.750
who are knowing that something has to happen,

00:10:01.999 --> 00:10:04.166
some breakthrough has to take place,

00:10:04.667 --> 00:10:06.208
something we have to seek.

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.875
Imagine at the time of Christ there were not

00:10:09.041 --> 00:10:11.417
so many people who were seeking,

00:10:11.667 --> 00:10:14.166
nobody could talk to the disciples also much.

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:18.417
They were just ordinary fishermen, very simple people.

00:10:18.667 --> 00:10:20.875
But today is the time when you find so many

00:10:21.083 --> 00:10:26.542
of seekers all over the world. Seeking what?

00:10:26.875 --> 00:10:33.875
What are you seeking? The seeking is of your Spirit.

00:10:34.083 --> 00:10:36.208
Now this is also a very vague term to say

00:10:36.542 --> 00:10:37.625
you are seeking your Spirit.

00:10:37.875 --> 00:10:40.166
Now what is this Spirit supposed to be?

00:10:40.333 --> 00:10:44.500
And why should we seek this Spirit?

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:48.917
In our evolution we are human beings,

00:10:49.333 --> 00:10:54.083
our awareness is that of human beings and this awareness

00:10:54.333 --> 00:10:59.041
of human beings is not the ultimate.

00:11:00.625 --> 00:11:06.208
If it was we would not have been seeking.

00:11:07.083 --> 00:11:09.208
It’s not the end of it.

00:11:09.542 --> 00:11:12.417
We have to reach at a point where

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:16.333
something more has to happen.

00:11:16.667 --> 00:11:19.792
Now how do we approach the subject logically?

00:11:20.041 --> 00:11:24.625
In our evolution, what has happened to us?

00:11:25.625 --> 00:11:30.417
We were animals, from there we became human beings.

00:11:30.792 --> 00:11:36.291
What is so special about human beings compared to animals?

00:11:37.083 --> 00:11:40.999
In the awareness of man there’s a new dimension.

00:11:41.208 --> 00:11:44.166
For example you can take a horse through a dirty lane,

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:46.750
he doesn’t feel anything, the dirt or filth,

00:11:46.917 --> 00:11:50.625
or beauty, colors, nothing. Makes no difference.

00:11:50.875 --> 00:11:54.750
But if you take a human being through a dirty lane or a

00:11:54.999 --> 00:12:00.417
dirty house, immediately he understands, he doesn’t like it.

00:12:01.625 --> 00:12:06.667
So what has come into us is nothing but in our awareness

00:12:06.999 --> 00:12:11.083
a new dimension compared to animals,

00:12:11.333 --> 00:12:18.999
or we can say in very scientific way is that in our central

00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:25.291
nervous system we have developed a new awareness.

00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:29.291
Whatever is in our central nervous system,

00:12:29.667 --> 00:12:34.583
we are master of that. Supposing I feel this is hot,

00:12:34.917 --> 00:12:36.792
everybody will feel this is hot.

00:12:37.417 --> 00:12:44.291
If I say this is the color of this particular bird,

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:47.875
everybody will say the same thing.

00:12:48.083 --> 00:12:50.667
So whatever is the awareness of one human being,

00:12:50.917 --> 00:12:53.750
awareness I am saying, not the myth, not the hallucination,

00:12:53.999 --> 00:13:02.583
but the reality as far as his organs are concerned,

00:13:02.875 --> 00:13:06.417
sensory organs are concerned is just the same.

00:13:06.667 --> 00:13:11.750
A person who feels hot does not say that he feels cold,

00:13:11.999 --> 00:13:14.125
nor the other one will come and say it is cold,

00:13:14.417 --> 00:13:19.875
they all will say it is hot. So one thing is there,

00:13:20.083 --> 00:13:24.917
the truth is one, it cannot be two,

00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:27.417
and that whatever has to happen now in our

00:13:27.917 --> 00:13:31.999
evolution has to be in our awareness.

00:13:32.291 --> 00:13:34.333
Like a fish became a turtle.

00:13:34.667 --> 00:13:38.208
If a fish became a turtle, what happened to her?

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:41.917
It is in the awareness of the turtle,

00:13:46.458 --> 00:13:50.792
it started feeling the Mother Earth. It lost something

00:13:50.999 --> 00:13:54.667
that fish had and it started feeling something new.

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:57.458
In the same way, in our evolution if something

00:13:57.667 --> 00:14:02.291
has to happen, we have to be something more

00:14:02.542 --> 00:14:07.999
in awareness, more dynamic. For this we can take

00:14:08.208 --> 00:14:14.542
help from the writings of so many people.

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:17.083
For example we can consider Jung

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:20.667
as one of them who has talked about it.

00:14:20.917 --> 00:14:31.250
Jung has said that when the breakthrough will take place,

00:14:32.999 --> 00:14:34.667
the human beings will become,

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:39.792
will become collectively conscious, will become.

00:14:39.999 --> 00:14:44.125
He didn’t say that you’ll all start doing the same thing

00:14:44.417 --> 00:14:47.250
or you will start behaving in the same manner.

00:14:47.583 --> 00:14:51.125
No, he said you will become, you will be aware of it,

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:55.583
not unawares. So when you are seeking the Spirit,

00:14:55.792 --> 00:15:01.333
if the Spirit has to enlighten you, in your awareness you are

00:15:01.542 --> 00:15:07.709
going to know something more than you have known so far.

00:15:08.999 --> 00:15:12.208
For example, you might feel it hot and cold today

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.917
but maybe with that awareness you might

00:15:14.041 --> 00:15:17.458
feel something different about it.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:21.458
He has said it very clearly that you have

00:15:21.709 --> 00:15:24.667
to become collectively conscious.

00:15:24.834 --> 00:15:27.834
So the becoming is the point in our evolution,

00:15:27.999 --> 00:15:31.333
nothing else, we become something else.

00:15:31.583 --> 00:15:35.834
In Sanskrit language for example they say, for a realized

00:15:35.999 --> 00:15:39.041
Soul, for Indians it’s very common knowledge,

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:42.709
it’s nothing so much difficult to understand,

00:15:43.125 --> 00:15:49.208
he’s called as a dwijaha, the one who is born again.

00:15:49.458 --> 00:15:52.792
And also a bird is called as a dwijaha,

00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:56.917
because a bird is born first as an egg and then it grows,

00:15:57.125 --> 00:16:01.917
matures and then suddenly it becomes a bird.

00:16:01.917 --> 00:16:05.333
And that is the parallel of Realization.

00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:08.834
You also know that on the Easter Day we give eggs.

00:16:09.041 --> 00:16:11.959
It has the same symbol, that we are eggs and

00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:14.792
we have to become the birds.

00:16:15.041 --> 00:16:17.917
So just now, at this stage when we are human beings

00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:26.250
we are just limited like an egg to grow up to a point

00:16:26.500 --> 00:16:28.917
where you can become the bird.

00:16:29.125 --> 00:16:35.250
All other sort of things people talk of is not the Realization.

00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.917
Like I may say that “All right, if I mesmerize you very well,

00:16:40.166 --> 00:16:42.625
I can give you bottles and you might start

00:16:42.834 --> 00:16:46.500
sucking the bottles just like children.”

00:16:46.834 --> 00:16:48.750
Even knowing that you are doing something funny,

00:16:48.999 --> 00:16:50.999
you are doing it.

00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:54.834
You’ll be compelled to do it because you are mesmerized.

00:16:54.999 --> 00:17:00.709
Any such activity that you fall into is not Realization

00:17:00.959 --> 00:17:04.583
because whatever has happened to you as human beings

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:08.917
that you are, you have done no activity whatsoever.

00:17:09.125 --> 00:17:11.500
We didn’t cut our tails as monkeys to

00:17:11.834 --> 00:17:14.959
become human beings. It has happened spontaneously

00:17:15.166 --> 00:17:19.709
like a flower becoming a fruit. It’s a living process.

00:17:20.041 --> 00:17:23.250
One does not realize that whatever has to happen

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.458
to you is a living process, is not a dead process.

00:17:27.709 --> 00:17:29.500
What we can do is all dead.

00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:32.125
For example we can stand on our heads, we can jump,

00:17:32.375 --> 00:17:35.625
we can run, we can do all kinds of things but

00:17:35.917 --> 00:17:38.125
that is not the living process.

00:17:38.375 --> 00:17:42.041
The living process is when you become something,

00:17:42.333 --> 00:17:46.500
and that becoming must be asked by all honest seekers.

00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:49.583
If you are not honest, then it’s difficult,

00:17:49.834 --> 00:17:52.375
or even if you are honest and you are misidentified

00:17:52.625 --> 00:17:54.917
with certain ideas you have read because you have paid

00:17:55.041 --> 00:17:56.750
for the book or you have paid for an organization

00:17:56.959 --> 00:18:00.041
or paid for someone, that’s not going to help you.

00:18:00.375 --> 00:18:03.291
What we have to see what we become,

00:18:03.625 --> 00:18:08.291
and that’s what yesterday I told that you become the master.

00:18:08.500 --> 00:18:10.959
You become the prophet as Blake has said that,

00:18:11.166 --> 00:18:12.750
“God of men [Shri Mataji may mean “Men of God”]

00:18:12.917 --> 00:18:14.875
will become prophets and they will have

00:18:15.125 --> 00:18:17.750
powers to make others prophets.”

00:18:17.999 --> 00:18:19.999
So to be very honest with yourself you should say,

00:18:20.291 --> 00:18:26.375
“Have I become a prophet and can I make others prophets?”

00:18:26.709 --> 00:18:30.375
This is a very simple way of looking at our Realization

00:18:30.625 --> 00:18:33.834
and this what you are capable of,

00:18:33.999 --> 00:18:36.959
that you become the prophet, because everything is within you,

00:18:37.125 --> 00:18:39.583
the whole machinery is within you, you are like a computer,

00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:42.250
you are just to be put to the mains, it will start working.

00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.834
You have to just become that.

00:18:46.041 --> 00:18:49.834
And if you do not become that, then all other things,

00:18:50.959 --> 00:18:55.125
forming an organization and any such thing, is of no use,

00:18:55.417 --> 00:19:04.834
is of no value, is all, I can say, misguidance.

00:19:05.041 --> 00:19:06.750
What have you got yourself?

00:19:06.959 --> 00:19:09.250
Supposing, I mean, if Ray has to say something:

00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:12.291
“Oh, Mother saw a light, and this happened and that happened;

00:19:12.583 --> 00:19:16.583
She has these powers, and those powers,” it’s all useless.

00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:17.999
What is it to you?

00:19:18.291 --> 00:19:21.500
I may be the king of anything, so what does it matter to you?

00:19:21.834 --> 00:19:25.625
What has become of you is the important thing and for that

00:19:25.875 --> 00:19:28.500
becoming if I say there is everything placed within you

00:19:28.834 --> 00:19:33.166
I have to prove it that’s all.

00:19:33.750 --> 00:19:38.125
This knowledge is not unknown to us, actually.

00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:41.166
Is all been described from the time of Moses.

00:19:41.500 --> 00:19:43.583
Like He says,

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:46.583
“The tree of fire.” Now what is the tree of fire?

00:19:46.999 --> 00:19:50.041
Nobody knows, they just say there was tree of fire.

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:52.166
But if you see the Kundalini completely enlightened,

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:58.250
if you can see it really looks like a tree of fire.

00:19:58.959 --> 00:20:01.166
And then it is said also in the Bible that,

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.750
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames.”

00:20:04.959 --> 00:20:07.834
Now what is that? No one explains, nobody knows,

00:20:08.166 --> 00:20:11.166
these tongues of flames are nothing but these centers when

00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:16.583
they are enlightened, you see them just like tongues of flames.

00:20:16.875 --> 00:20:20.250
But you need not see them because when you are outside

00:20:20.542 --> 00:20:22.750
the pavilion you can see the pavilion; when you are inside

00:20:23.041 --> 00:20:27.041
you don’t see, you just see the hall.

00:20:27.291 --> 00:20:34.041
And that is why one should understand that it is not what

00:20:34.542 --> 00:20:39.875
we think should happen, but it is what will

00:20:40.125 --> 00:20:43.166
happen actually we should accept.

00:20:43.625 --> 00:20:45.959
So first we should get rid of all misidentifications

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:49.291
with our ideas that this will happen, that will happen,

00:20:49.625 --> 00:20:51.875
and this should happen, I should see a light,

00:20:52.041 --> 00:20:54.750
I should fly in the air.

00:20:55.083 --> 00:20:56.375
There are many people who are paying

00:20:56.625 --> 00:20:59.959
money to fly in the air. I mean it’s absurd.

00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:01.834
Why do you want to fly in the air? I don’t understand.

00:21:02.083 --> 00:21:05.417
Paying much more money for that than they would

00:21:05.834 --> 00:21:07.834
have to pay to go round the whole world.

00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:09.834
I really tell you by plane if you have to travel

00:21:10.041 --> 00:21:11.166
it won’t so expensive as you are paying

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.625
for this flying business, this Flying Squad business.

00:21:14.959 --> 00:21:17.500
And what is that, we have to understand, what is that?

00:21:17.875 --> 00:21:21.417
When we go for this flying what are we getting into?

00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:25.250
And this method of mesmerism is so subtle

00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:29.542
that you cannot understand.  You just go on it.

00:21:29.999 --> 00:21:35.250
Like the same Flying Squad business, we had a gentleman

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.291
who was the director of the academy,

00:21:39.542 --> 00:21:42.250
down with epilepsy, his wife down with epilepsy,

00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:46.291
the child down with epilepsy; and they all came down to Me,

00:21:46.625 --> 00:21:49.999
they lost their houses, they lost everything, penniless.

00:21:51.083 --> 00:21:55.208
This is what has happened to the flying of the whole joke.

00:21:55.500 --> 00:22:00.083
Now, one must realize that you cannot pay

00:22:01.625 --> 00:22:03.834
for your evolution, you cannot pay.

00:22:04.041 --> 00:22:05.375
It’s very simple to understand.

00:22:05.542 --> 00:22:07.625
As I told yesterday that if you pay to this

00:22:07.875 --> 00:22:10.083
flower will it become a fruit?

00:22:10.417 --> 00:22:13.959
It’s a living process for which we cannot pay,

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.500
it doesn’t understand money.

00:22:15.834 --> 00:22:17.542
Living processes do not understand money.

00:22:17.834 --> 00:22:19.291
I’ve not known any human being,

00:22:19.542 --> 00:22:21.667
supposing he’s suffering from indigestion,

00:22:21.875 --> 00:22:23.750
he’ll put some money there saying that “Now I pay you,

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:26.083
my stomach, now will you digest my food?”

00:22:26.417 --> 00:22:27.625
Do we do like that?

00:22:27.834 --> 00:22:32.041
In the same way it is the highest of highest living processes

00:22:32.375 --> 00:22:36.667
for which you cannot pay.

00:22:36.959 --> 00:22:39.667
It’s a very subtle thing to understand for human beings

00:22:39.875 --> 00:22:43.166
because they believe that for everything one has to pay,

00:22:43.375 --> 00:22:44.999
otherwise it doesn’t work out.

00:22:45.208 --> 00:22:48.625
You see you go to a machine, you want to have a good,

00:22:48.959 --> 00:22:50.792
say, machine, you must pay.

00:22:51.041 --> 00:22:53.625
Which works, you see. If doesn’t work, you can have free.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:56.417
But the one that works we have to pay.

00:22:56.667 --> 00:23:00.291
Any motorcar, it’s free, means it’s all a junk, you can’t have it.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:03.208
We have to pay to take it to the junk shop, so it is

00:23:03.667 --> 00:23:08.875
always in the minds of human beings that one has to pay.

00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:12.083
And this is very wrong, that you cannot pay.

00:23:12.291 --> 00:23:17.999
I’m talking of the processes, which are beyond human,

00:23:18.208 --> 00:23:20.208
the human beings are not doing it.

00:23:20.542 --> 00:23:23.333
For example we cannot transform a flower into fruit,

00:23:23.667 --> 00:23:26.959
the living process itself is beyond human reach.

00:23:27.083 --> 00:23:31.667
But when you become, when you become

00:23:31.875 --> 00:23:35.041
a superhuman you can handle them.

00:23:35.291 --> 00:23:36.542
And this should happen to you.

00:23:36.959 --> 00:23:38.959
If it has does not happen to you all the rest

00:23:39.166 --> 00:23:40.792
of the things are wrong.

00:23:41.083 --> 00:23:44.999
I’m telling you with great concern because the people who

00:23:45.166 --> 00:23:49.333
are in the market, who are selling goods,

00:23:49.625 --> 00:23:51.667
are doing it very well.

00:23:51.999 --> 00:23:54.792
They know how to entice you, they know how to put

00:23:55.083 --> 00:23:58.792
ideas through you, how to give you misidentifications, and you

00:23:59.083 --> 00:24:06.542
just get identified with them till they completely drop out.

00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:08.166
And then you are left high and dry.

00:24:08.417 --> 00:24:12.625
You say, “Oh, God, what has happened?”

00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:17.041
One thing is there, that your Spirit is not lost.

00:24:17.333 --> 00:24:20.166
It is there. Despite whatever the mistakes,

00:24:20.417 --> 00:24:25.625
whatever may be the seeking, but the Spirit resides within

00:24:25.875 --> 00:24:29.750
you despite everything, till you live.

00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:33.625
And this Spirit is to be brought into your conscious mind,

00:24:33.917 --> 00:24:37.208
means into your central nervous system,

00:24:37.458 --> 00:24:41.625
you should feel the powers of the Spirit in your being.

00:24:41.792 --> 00:24:43.999
This is what is Sahaja Yoga is. Sahaja,

00:24:44.208 --> 00:24:47.333
as he must have told you, means born with you.

00:24:47.625 --> 00:24:49.750
Now, yesterday I told you about the left side,

00:24:50.041 --> 00:24:53.291
which is the power of desire, and through this power

00:24:53.625 --> 00:24:58.041
we have our all conditionings and all the reception

00:24:58.291 --> 00:25:02.750
from the matter, materialistic things and also what you can

00:25:02.999 --> 00:25:07.291
say we collect all our past, the past then  extend up

00:25:07.542 --> 00:25:08.917
through the collective subconscious.

00:25:09.083 --> 00:25:12.041
I also told you yesterday that cancer is a disease caused

00:25:12.208 --> 00:25:15.875
by the left side extreme behavior of people.

00:25:16.041 --> 00:25:18.542
Those who go into the extreme behavior on the left side

00:25:18.792 --> 00:25:22.999
get the disease called cancer and it can be cured if you can

00:25:23.208 --> 00:25:26.166
bring such an extreme case in the center,

00:25:26.417 --> 00:25:29.333
it can be cured, no doubt about it.

00:25:29.667 --> 00:25:34.792
Now, the second part is the right side which today I have

00:25:34.999 --> 00:25:36.333
told that I will tell you about.

00:25:36.583 --> 00:25:38.667
The gentleman is not here who asked

00:25:38.999 --> 00:25:42.083
so many questions, is he here?

00:25:42.333 --> 00:25:44.667
He was just busy asking questions, that’s all, yesterday.

00:25:44.917 --> 00:25:46.999
He’s not interested in seeking, I think.

00:25:47.291 --> 00:25:49.792
All right, now the second side on the right hand side,

00:25:49.999 --> 00:25:52.917
is the power by which we act.

00:25:53.166 --> 00:25:55.333
First we desire and then we act.

00:25:55.667 --> 00:25:58.417
Now this power, right side power, is expressed within

00:25:58.667 --> 00:26:01.999
us as right sympathetic nervous system.

00:26:02.166 --> 00:26:04.750
Science has come from the same, science is in the gross,

00:26:05.083 --> 00:26:07.667
these are all subtle things that are within us.

00:26:07.917 --> 00:26:10.458
Now this right side power which exists within us,

00:26:10.750 --> 00:26:16.458
gives us the power for our mental and physical capacity to act.

00:26:16.792 --> 00:26:19.417
Now this action takes place when we desire something,

00:26:19.667 --> 00:26:23.999
we want to implement that desire then we go into action.

00:26:24.208 --> 00:26:27.542
One has to understand what sort of a power is this.

00:26:27.917 --> 00:26:31.083
This power is called as prana shakti in Sanskrit.

00:26:31.333 --> 00:26:34.917
Prana, and the another one, the left one as mana shakti

00:26:35.166 --> 00:26:39.417
is the power of the emotions or can say of the mind,

00:26:39.667 --> 00:26:42.999
but you see English language is not so clear-cut about it.

00:26:43.125 --> 00:26:46.125
So I would say mana shakti and the prana shakti,

00:26:46.417 --> 00:26:48.999
these are the two powers that exist within us and we start

00:26:49.166 --> 00:26:54.333
using them as left and right, we can say like a brake and an

00:26:54.542 --> 00:26:58.542
accelerator and then we become the master of driving.

00:26:58.750 --> 00:27:01.792
But while becoming that we make mistakes.

00:27:01.999 --> 00:27:05.458
The human mind has a speciality to go to extremes.

00:27:05.625 --> 00:27:08.583
Supposing I tell somebody, “Now, you have to meditate.”

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:09.917
They’ll meditate for five hours.

00:27:10.041 --> 00:27:12.709
There is no need to meditate for five hours or anything.

00:27:12.959 --> 00:27:15.166
But if you tell them that you have to stand on your head,

00:27:15.458 --> 00:27:16.959
they’ll do it for ten hours.

00:27:17.166 --> 00:27:18.750
So there is no need to go to extremes,

00:27:18.999 --> 00:27:21.709
we have to be just in the center, be kind to our body,

00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:23.375
be kind to ourselves.

00:27:23.625 --> 00:27:26.709
There’s nothing to be frantic about; there’s nothing to be

00:27:26.999 --> 00:27:30.250
so much exasperated about it.

00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:34.375
It’s just very simple thing that has to happen to you.

00:27:34.583 --> 00:27:37.834
For example, think of a seed which is sown in a very

00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:42.500
loud music or, say, a place where everybody is rushing,

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:45.625
shouting, screaming, what will happen to that seed,

00:27:45.834 --> 00:27:47.041
will never sprout.

00:27:47.250 --> 00:27:50.458
If it is in a peaceful place, is a properly placed one,

00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:56.250
or not in a tilted pot, then it will definitely develop into

00:27:56.583 --> 00:28:00.834
a beautiful tree or a beautiful shrub,

00:28:01.125 --> 00:28:02.917
whatever it has to develop into.

00:28:03.125 --> 00:28:06.375
In the same way if we are too much on the extremes,

00:28:06.625 --> 00:28:08.709
we go to the left and to the right.

00:28:08.959 --> 00:28:11.250
Now going to the left, I told you yesterday what happens

00:28:11.583 --> 00:28:16.458
that all these things like hypnosis, and ESP’s and most

00:28:16.709 --> 00:28:18.375
of these gurus try these tricks, you see,

00:28:18.625 --> 00:28:23.999
like they just make you hypnotized and people become

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:28.041
absolutely mad towards the guru, “He’s our guru,” and

00:28:28.291 --> 00:28:32.625
they behave just like absolutely people without any brains.

00:28:32.917 --> 00:28:35.583
“Oh, I feel nice with that guru.” The reason is that

00:28:35.875 --> 00:28:39.291
you feel there’s a sort of a sense of security built-in in

00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:43.834
this gentleman and, “if I’m following him, you see,

00:28:44.041 --> 00:28:46.125
he is going to Heaven and I’m going with him to Heaven.”

00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:48.166
It doesn’t happen like that.

00:28:48.458 --> 00:28:51.041
You have to individually go into Heaven yourself and you

00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:53.041
have to become your own guru and you have

00:28:53.291 --> 00:28:54.709
to know everything about it.

00:28:54.959 --> 00:29:00.166
It’s not that anybody can put a trailer behind and put some

00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.583
people into it and say,

00:29:01.834 --> 00:29:02.999
“Now come along, I’m going to Heaven.”

00:29:03.291 --> 00:29:05.999
Most of these are people are really going to Hell and you

00:29:06.250 --> 00:29:09.041
will follow them very fast.

00:29:09.291 --> 00:29:13.166
So it is never so, believe Me, that anybody who says that

00:29:13.375 --> 00:29:14.959
following a certain guru you’ll go to

00:29:15.125 --> 00:29:17.583
Heaven is absolutely wrong.

00:29:17.875 --> 00:29:20.583
You must follow in the Principle and every guru who

00:29:20.834 --> 00:29:23.166
is a real guru will always tell you,

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:26.709
will always tell you that you have to become something.

00:29:26.959 --> 00:29:29.291
He’ll never just say, “All right, you’ve given me the money,

00:29:29.583 --> 00:29:32.500
all right, you are the member, now you are my child,

00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:35.458
now you are my disciple and I give you my love.

00:29:35.750 --> 00:29:38.166
Let’s have love.” Where is the love? “

00:29:39.625 --> 00:29:41.500
And give more money, give me Rolls Royces,

00:29:41.959 --> 00:29:43.250
give me this, give me that.”

00:29:43.583 --> 00:29:46.375
And like mad we are doing it thinking that

00:29:46.625 --> 00:29:49.999
we can exchange these things.

00:29:50.250 --> 00:29:53.375
Now, as we are seekers we have every right to find

00:29:53.709 --> 00:29:56.750
our Spirits and we are not to be deluded by any such

00:29:56.999 --> 00:30:00.166
tricks and pranks of these people or I would say very

00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:02.375
sinister methods that they are employing.

00:30:02.709 --> 00:30:04.999
Not only to initiate you for money, I don’t mind

00:30:05.250 --> 00:30:06.583
they are smugglers, let them have money,

00:30:06.834 --> 00:30:08.583
what they want to have; but they spoil your chances

00:30:08.875 --> 00:30:10.959
of Realization which you do not realize.

00:30:11.166 --> 00:30:14.375
And once they are spoilt, it’s very difficult to give

00:30:14.709 --> 00:30:16.709
you Realization, and if you do not really,

00:30:16.875 --> 00:30:21.875
positively work it out it’s going to be impossible situation.

00:30:22.250 --> 00:30:25.959
I’ve seen people who have suffered on account of this.

00:30:26.250 --> 00:30:29.999
Now this action within us acts for our mental and physical

00:30:30.291 --> 00:30:32.999
capacities on the right hand side.

00:30:33.250 --> 00:30:35.875
Like we think of the future, now the planning will start,

00:30:36.166 --> 00:30:38.625
this planning, “Now we must do this tomorrow, or day after

00:30:38.875 --> 00:30:40.709
tomorrow we have to do it.” and we start sitting,

00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:43.500
“Now, I’ll go there and I’ll find this and then I’ll take

00:30:43.750 --> 00:30:45.834
a ticket and then I’ll go there.”

00:30:46.125 --> 00:30:48.125
I mean, our mind is working for the future.

00:30:48.375 --> 00:30:52.500
So much so, we, we become absolutely futuristic,

00:30:52.834 --> 00:30:55.750
to such an extent sometimes I’ve met people who are futuristic,

00:30:55.999 --> 00:30:58.625
they even forget their own names. Can you believe it?

00:30:58.875 --> 00:31:00.417
I mean they don’t even remember their father’s name.

00:31:00.709 --> 00:31:02.750
That’s all right, but even their own names they forget.

00:31:02.999 --> 00:31:05.875
I mean they are like mad people because they don’t remember

00:31:06.125 --> 00:31:07.417
their own names and they don’t know

00:31:07.709 --> 00:31:10.291
where are they, what are they doing.

00:31:10.542 --> 00:31:13.834
I have met people of that kind who are really sick people

00:31:14.041 --> 00:31:17.166
because they have become so futuristic now that they

00:31:17.417 --> 00:31:20.166
do not know anything about their past.

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:25.250
Now this futuristic behavior starts in a society where

00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.542
people always think of the future.

00:31:27.834 --> 00:31:30.625
“What will I do, what am I to do tomorrow,

00:31:30.875 --> 00:31:32.083
what am I to achieve tomorrow?”

00:31:32.709 --> 00:31:34.709
And all these things, when they start doing

00:31:35.999 --> 00:31:38.083
their attention goes to the right extreme.

00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:41.999
Now, in this place we are very dangerously placed,

00:31:42.291 --> 00:31:45.041
very dangerously placed, when we start looking for the

00:31:45.291 --> 00:31:53.750
future and the future seeing is a imaginary stuff,

00:31:54.041 --> 00:31:58.542
is absolutely imaginary, because what you think

00:31:58.875 --> 00:32:02.875
of the future doesn’t exist. What exists is the present,

00:32:03.166 --> 00:32:05.875
you have to be in the present not in the future.

00:32:06.166 --> 00:32:09.959
But people will say you have to be in the present, but how?

00:32:11.250 --> 00:32:14.625
We cannot. Either we are in the past or in the future.

00:32:14.875 --> 00:32:18.250
Because when the thought wave rises, it comes up and goes down.

00:32:18.542 --> 00:32:22.291
Another thought wave rises, goes up and comes down.

00:32:22.625 --> 00:32:25.250
Now, this thought wave which comes up,

00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:27.875
we go with it but we don’t see it’s going down.

00:32:28.083 --> 00:32:30.999
Another thought wave that rises, we see that but

00:32:31.291 --> 00:32:32.834
don’t see where it goes out.

00:32:33.041 --> 00:32:35.250
And so we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:38.834
and we do not know, perhaps we are with the past

00:32:39.041 --> 00:32:42.375
or perhaps with the future. But in the center of these two

00:32:42.834 --> 00:32:45.375
thoughts there is the present and we don’t know

00:32:45.667 --> 00:32:48.667
how to take our attention there, which is a very difficult thing

00:32:48.959 --> 00:32:52.959
and just to say that you should be in the center is not possible.

00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:55.500
All these things, “You should do this, you should do that,”

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.625
is not going to work out unless and until there is light.

00:32:58.875 --> 00:33:01.625
For example, there is no light in this room and you say,

00:33:01.875 --> 00:33:04.208
“Walk straight,” you cannot walk because you can’t see

00:33:04.542 --> 00:33:06.041
where is the passage, how to walk.

00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:08.041
Even if you order, do whatever you please,

00:33:08.291 --> 00:33:11.291
you cannot just walk straight without touching any of these

00:33:11.542 --> 00:33:14.375
chairs because there is no light, you can’t see.

00:33:14.792 --> 00:33:17.542
So one has to understand that in the

00:33:17.875 --> 00:33:20.417
futuristic life when we live and we plan too

00:33:20.667 --> 00:33:23.166
much for the future, actually what we are doing,

00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:25.750
we are living in an imaginary world.

00:33:26.500 --> 00:33:28.667
We have many stories of people who lived in imaginary

00:33:28.959 --> 00:33:33.375
worlds and how they found that everything was destroyed.

00:33:33.667 --> 00:33:37.792
And there are people who work it out through their

00:33:38.041 --> 00:33:40.542
physical efforts, and when they go into their physical

00:33:40.834 --> 00:33:44.333
efforts they create another problem for them because

00:33:44.625 --> 00:33:48.083
they just become physically oriented people.

00:33:48.417 --> 00:33:50.750
And if you are just physically oriented,

00:33:51.041 --> 00:33:53.417
the Spirit gets angry with you.

00:33:53.667 --> 00:33:56.625
So the right side movement is for the people who

00:33:56.875 --> 00:33:59.500
are very meticulous, you see, which you can call the people

00:33:59.750 --> 00:34:02.500
who are very particular about the time and who are very

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:07.417
firm about things, who are very dry people and who are very

00:34:07.625 --> 00:34:10.750
straight and they won’t tolerate any nonsense.

00:34:10.999 --> 00:34:13.417
One sort of people, you see, that you find normally and

00:34:13.625 --> 00:34:17.542
that sort of people become a headache and

00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:19.917
they are very boring, you see.

00:34:20.291 --> 00:34:21.625
You can’t just bear their company,

00:34:21.875 --> 00:34:23.625
they can be very boring people.

00:34:23.875 --> 00:34:25.792
And they give you big lectures about how to be

00:34:26.041 --> 00:34:28.917
straightforward and how to walk straight absolutely.

00:34:29.291 --> 00:34:33.083
In the nature nothing is straight, it all moves so

00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:37.083
beautifully because the nature is created out of varieties,

00:34:37.333 --> 00:34:38.959
and variety brings the beauty.

00:34:39.166 --> 00:34:41.333
They don’t think of beauty, they don’t think of love,

00:34:41.625 --> 00:34:44.625
of compassion, nothing. For them it is a very meticulous

00:34:44.875 --> 00:34:46.917
world and that’s how they live.

00:34:47.166 --> 00:34:51.417
Such people are developing a big ego within themselves,

00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:57.333
as you see there, is a yellow stuff in the head called as ego.

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:03.208
By the action of the left side, emotional side,

00:35:03.542 --> 00:35:06.166
we develop a superego, but by the action of the right side

00:35:06.542 --> 00:35:11.542
we develop a ego. Now this ego is not easy to be seen.

00:35:11.792 --> 00:35:14.667
Because if you have a superego you have pains

00:35:14.917 --> 00:35:18.208
in the body, you are a miserable person, you have wrinkles

00:35:18.458 --> 00:35:21.875
on the face and you look absolutely worn out.

00:35:22.083 --> 00:35:25.208
But if you have ego then you look so dynamic.

00:35:25.500 --> 00:35:29.458
We can say that Hitler was the extreme of this ego business.

00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:34.166
And he got into his head that he is some sort of a god

00:35:34.458 --> 00:35:37.083
incarnation and that he has to save the people,

00:35:37.417 --> 00:35:40.792
and he was the one who knows about races and everything

00:35:41.041 --> 00:35:44.917
and he is supposed to save some race.

00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:48.542
This kind of idea comes from these people who

00:35:48.875 --> 00:35:52.875
are right sided, they are very aggressive, they may be very

00:35:53.083 --> 00:35:56.875
good to talk to, they may be very humble to look at,

00:35:57.542 --> 00:36:00.166
could be very good business men, could be anything,

00:36:00.417 --> 00:36:03.208
but they do not know that they have this Mister Ego

00:36:03.542 --> 00:36:06.333
coming up on their heads just like a big balloon

00:36:06.625 --> 00:36:09.917
and they are floating in the air. The end of ego is stupidity.

00:36:10.166 --> 00:36:12.750
You’ll be surprised, the end of ego is stupidity.

00:36:12.999 --> 00:36:16.166
Such people indulge into all kinds of stupid things,

00:36:16.417 --> 00:36:18.417
and they say, “What’s wrong?”

00:36:18.667 --> 00:36:21.917
For example I’ve known old people behaving in so

00:36:22.208 --> 00:36:24.750
stupid ways, and they say, “What’s wrong?”

00:36:24.999 --> 00:36:26.917
You know, an old man, say of ninety years,

00:36:27.208 --> 00:36:30.999
Who can’t even walk without a stick, takes to these dances you

00:36:31.208 --> 00:36:33.999
do and then he falls down, you see, and

00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:36.999
he thinks, “what’s wrong?” Like a lady I knew, she was

00:36:37.291 --> 00:36:41.166
about eighty-five, she died from a horse falling down.

00:36:41.333 --> 00:36:44.208
Naturally I mean what else you expect at eighty-five,

00:36:44.458 --> 00:36:46.917
that’s what is evident, for a lady of eighty-five she should

00:36:47.166 --> 00:36:49.792
settle down at home, look after her grandchildren,

00:36:49.999 --> 00:36:51.999
maybe she might have great grandchildren, you see.

00:36:52.291 --> 00:36:54.291
Instead of that why does she want to be twenty-five-year-old

00:36:54.583 --> 00:36:57.333
lady to climb on a horse?

00:36:57.542 --> 00:37:01.083
So all such stupid things they do and then they will say,

00:37:01.291 --> 00:37:04.208
“What’s wrong?” Is nothing wrong in stupidity, what’s wrong?

00:37:04.542 --> 00:37:10.083
But such people are a nuisance to the society, to others.

00:37:10.417 --> 00:37:13.999
The people who are superego are troublesome to themselves,

00:37:14.291 --> 00:37:18.458
but those are egoistical are troublesome to others.

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.750
They are all the time correcting others, torturing others,

00:37:21.999 --> 00:37:25.667
putting their ideas on to other people, and such people

00:37:25.917 --> 00:37:28.792
can be very, very successful because nothing

00:37:29.083 --> 00:37:30.583
succeeds like success.

00:37:30.875 --> 00:37:34.208
They go on hammering things into the heads of people,

00:37:34.458 --> 00:37:36.417
saying, “Now this is true, this is true,”

00:37:36.667 --> 00:37:38.875
and when you go on saying it, this you suddenly believe,

00:37:39.083 --> 00:37:42.583
“Yes, must be so.” And such people are much more dangerous

00:37:42.917 --> 00:37:44.792
I would say from the superego type.

00:37:44.999 --> 00:37:48.875
But for people who do not know the tricks of the

00:37:48.999 --> 00:37:55.917
superego they can be very, very, very dangerous because

00:37:56.458 --> 00:38:00.291
they are very subtle, you cannot see them, they mesmerize,

00:38:00.583 --> 00:38:06.083
and they can possess you and they can be very sly, and they can

00:38:06.333 --> 00:38:09.917
work out all sorts of methods which you are not aware.

00:38:10.125 --> 00:38:14.583
So it is not easy to choose which is better, which is not better.

00:38:14.917 --> 00:38:17.542
Both things are wrong to go to extremes,

00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:20.083
on the right or to the left.

00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:22.458
Now let’s see what happens physically.

00:38:22.917 --> 00:38:25.999
As I told about the cancer on the left hand side that we do,

00:38:26.291 --> 00:38:29.125
physically what happens to people who are futuristic?

00:38:29.333 --> 00:38:32.333
We have a center specially for futuristic behavior

00:38:32.583 --> 00:38:35.875
called as Swadhisthana Chakra which is in the gross

00:38:36.417 --> 00:38:41.125
manifesting the plexus called the aortic plexus within us.

00:38:41.458 --> 00:38:44.125
Now this Swadhisthana Chakra is very important for human

00:38:44.417 --> 00:38:48.250
beings, specially for people who are developed people.

00:38:48.542 --> 00:38:52.999
With this chakra actually we convert the fat of the stomach

00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:55.250
for the use of the brain.

00:38:55.542 --> 00:38:59.999
Now this is the center of the Surya, of the sun.

00:39:00.250 --> 00:39:04.333
Now when we start thinking, these cells are converted

00:39:04.999 --> 00:39:08.917
in such a way that they become useful to the brain.

00:39:09.125 --> 00:39:12.458
Now, if you are thinking all the time, all the time

00:39:12.667 --> 00:39:14.458
you are thinking, then what will happen?

00:39:14.999 --> 00:39:17.208
I mean the horns are not going to grow out of that.

00:39:17.458 --> 00:39:20.999
You are consuming all that, and then you are consuming

00:39:21.208 --> 00:39:24.458
all those cells, you have to have replacement,

00:39:24.709 --> 00:39:28.208
and for that replacement this Swadhisthana Chakra has to work

00:39:28.458 --> 00:39:33.709
very hard to convert the cells for the use of your brain.

00:39:33.999 --> 00:39:38.125
Now, when it is doing that there are other things which this

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:41.917
Swadhisthana Chakra has to look after; for example your liver,

00:39:42.208 --> 00:39:47.792
your pancreas, your spleen, your kidneys, all are to be looked

00:39:48.125 --> 00:39:53.417
after by this center, and also uterus for the ladies.

00:39:53.667 --> 00:39:56.709
Now, when there’s only one work is given to this

00:39:56.917 --> 00:40:00.458
Swadhisthan Chakra and it cannot do any other work,

00:40:00.709 --> 00:40:03.083
then other things are neglected, so you develop a

00:40:03.250 --> 00:40:06.583
terrible disease called liver trouble.

00:40:07.417 --> 00:40:10.542
Now liver trouble is another thing that you do not feel yourself.

00:40:10.792 --> 00:40:12.709
Others know that you are liverish the way you are

00:40:12.999 --> 00:40:18.583
hot tempered, the way you are fussy, the way you always

00:40:18.834 --> 00:40:25.667
snarl at people and the way you are never satisfied

00:40:25.917 --> 00:40:28.333
with anything, the way you criticize others;

00:40:28.583 --> 00:40:32.999
all this is liverish and such liverish people are never happy

00:40:33.208 --> 00:40:36.208
with themselves because liver looks after your attention.

00:40:36.458 --> 00:40:39.458
And those who have liver problems, their attention is horrid,

00:40:39.709 --> 00:40:41.458
that goes like this, you see, you cannot keep

00:40:41.709 --> 00:40:44.250
your attention straight. On the street you’ll walk straight

00:40:44.542 --> 00:40:46.709
into a car because you are looking at something which

00:40:46.959 --> 00:40:48.125
you are not supposed to look.

00:40:48.375 --> 00:40:49.834
But all the time you are looking at like this,

00:40:50.083 --> 00:40:52.333
you cannot walk, I mean you won’t find any animal like

00:40:52.583 --> 00:40:55.333
that who walks like this, but only human beings do it.

00:40:55.583 --> 00:40:57.083
If you see them on the street you’ll be amazed.

00:40:57.333 --> 00:40:59.375
Where are they walking? They don’t walk straight,

00:40:59.709 --> 00:41:01.792
they don’t look straight, but their eyes are going this way,

00:41:01.959 --> 00:41:03.709
that way, because the attention is wobbly,

00:41:03.959 --> 00:41:06.667
the attention is wobbly because of a bad liver.

00:41:06.917 --> 00:41:09.834
So this liver is a very, very important thing.

00:41:10.208 --> 00:41:15.667
Now, this liver has a special capacity to extract all the poisons

00:41:15.917 --> 00:41:20.125
from the body as heat, and the heat in the body is to be

00:41:20.375 --> 00:41:25.709
transformed or should be conveyed to the blood,

00:41:25.917 --> 00:41:28.834
or the water in the blood, and that has to be taken out

00:41:29.083 --> 00:41:33.250
of your body maybe as perspiration or in another forms.

00:41:33.583 --> 00:41:36.083
But what happens that when this liver is

00:41:36.333 --> 00:41:40.959
out of gear it cannot do it, it cannot pass this heat into

00:41:41.250 --> 00:41:43.709
the blood stream and the heat remains in the body

00:41:43.959 --> 00:41:47.458
and you really become heated and that

00:41:47.709 --> 00:41:51.792
heat makes all these problems for you.

00:41:52.083 --> 00:41:56.458
So in Sahaja Yoga what happens that when Kundalini rises,

00:41:56.709 --> 00:42:00.375
She changes the form of the blood.

00:42:01.458 --> 00:42:04.999
The hydrogen and oxygen which are placed because

00:42:05.250 --> 00:42:09.333
of this heat and all that in a very funny way, like this,

00:42:09.583 --> 00:42:12.709
get like that and they start receiving this heat within them.

00:42:12.959 --> 00:42:15.375
That’s why those people who have bad livers feel

00:42:15.667 --> 00:42:17.458
little heat when the Kundalini rises.

00:42:17.792 --> 00:42:20.500
But one can cure it by giving it that peace

00:42:20.792 --> 00:42:24.375
and comfort to that liver organ, and you can definitely

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:26.959
cure your liver, no doubt about it.

00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:30.333
Then the second thing that happens to you is

00:42:30.709 --> 00:42:34.500
the pancreas which gives you diabetes.

00:42:34.792 --> 00:42:37.333
Only a person who thinks too much gets the diabetes.

00:42:37.583 --> 00:42:40.709
For example, an Indian farmer doesn’t know what diabetes is.

00:42:40.959 --> 00:42:42.917
But then you stop your sugar, but that’s not the

00:42:43.125 --> 00:42:45.792
way to stop your diabetes. Diabetes comes to you because

00:42:45.999 --> 00:42:47.999
you think, think, think, think, think, too much.

00:42:48.333 --> 00:42:50.375
The doctors won’t understand this, that’s why they say it

00:42:50.625 --> 00:42:52.959
is incurable, because they cannot connect

00:42:53.208 --> 00:42:54.834
thinking with the disease.

00:42:55.125 --> 00:42:57.125
And this is what happens when you are all the time

00:42:57.458 --> 00:43:00.250
thinking like mad, then diabetes takes place.

00:43:00.583 --> 00:43:05.166
And this diabetes is also curable if you get your enlightenment.

00:43:05.625 --> 00:43:08.041
You can cure also the diabetes of other people,

00:43:08.250 --> 00:43:11.583
but because this vital power, which is integrated of all

00:43:11.834 --> 00:43:16.125
these three powers flows through you and you can replenish,

00:43:16.333 --> 00:43:21.333
you can give more to other people who are exhausted of it,

00:43:21.709 --> 00:43:25.583
and sort of you can fill them up with this power and you can cure.

00:43:25.917 --> 00:43:27.999
But the third one is the worst of all that happens to people

00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:30.834
is blood cancer, because of spleen.

00:43:31.125 --> 00:43:33.125
Spleen is one thing very important,

00:43:33.375 --> 00:43:37.458
that it is the center of peace within us.

00:43:37.709 --> 00:43:39.792
The one who doesn’t have a proper spleen

00:43:40.041 --> 00:43:41.917
cannot be peaceful person.

00:43:42.166 --> 00:43:45.583
Now, it’s a very simple thing but doctors cannot connect it,

00:43:45.834 --> 00:43:48.792
nor all science-oriented people can connect it,

00:43:48.999 --> 00:43:51.166
to something very, very simple.

00:43:51.458 --> 00:43:54.959
And the simple thing is that when we eat our food,

00:43:55.166 --> 00:44:00.834
if we are frantic we are out to get trouble with the spleen,

00:44:01.375 --> 00:44:03.917
and we can get blood cancer.

00:44:04.250 --> 00:44:07.041
Now if the mother is of that temperament or a father is of that

00:44:07.333 --> 00:44:11.583
temperament, the children might be born with blood cancer.

00:44:11.917 --> 00:44:16.375
Now, we’ll be happy to tell you that in New York we had a case

00:44:16.583 --> 00:44:20.792
of blood cancer and when I was in India, in a village,

00:44:20.999 --> 00:44:23.583
somebody came and told Me that such and such boy is sick,

00:44:23.959 --> 00:44:26.125
he’s only sixteen years with blood cancer and doctors have

00:44:26.333 --> 00:44:28.999
declared that he’s going to die within two weeks’ time.

00:44:29.250 --> 00:44:32.041
They always declare, they are good at declaration only.

00:44:32.375 --> 00:44:35.999
And when this case came to Me, I told them that

00:44:36.166 --> 00:44:38.250
“I cannot do anything, I’m in a village, but you can

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.375
telephone to one of the Sahaja Yoginis.

00:44:40.625 --> 00:44:43.709
She was in England, now she is in New York

00:44:43.999 --> 00:44:45.709
and she will look after this case.”

00:44:45.959 --> 00:44:48.625
You’ll be amazed that the boy was cured completely,

00:44:48.917 --> 00:44:50.834
he came out of the hospital, he came to see Me and now

00:44:51.125 --> 00:44:52.999
he’s gone back to his studies.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:55.375
I mean, it’s like this, we have cured many cases

00:44:55.709 --> 00:45:00.917
of blood cancer, but here we are not to cure people by any…

00:45:01.125 --> 00:45:03.166
or healing anyone, that’s not our job.

00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:06.125
It happens spontaneously as a by-product

00:45:06.375 --> 00:45:07.917
of the Kundalini awakening.

00:45:08.125 --> 00:45:09.999
Main thing is we have to make you doctors,

00:45:10.375 --> 00:45:12.250
we have to make you knowledgeable people,

00:45:12.500 --> 00:45:16.333
we have to make you collectively conscious human beings

00:45:16.709 --> 00:45:19.125
who have to enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:45:19.750 --> 00:45:22.834
to reside there in His peace, bliss and joy.

00:45:24.875 --> 00:45:28.999
Now this trouble of also of kidney, of high blood pressure,

00:45:29.250 --> 00:45:32.999
all that is due to this. People worry, they are frantic,

00:45:33.250 --> 00:45:35.291
you see, and this franticness comes to us

00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:37.375
just as a matter of habit. I’ve known people,

00:45:37.750 --> 00:45:39.250
as soon as you say,

00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.959
“Oh, you have to go by aeroplane somewhere,”

00:45:43.125 --> 00:45:46.166
suddenly the aeroplane word triggers that frantic, “Oh!”

00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:49.291
They get mad. They don’t know what they are up to.

00:45:49.542 --> 00:45:51.750
They’ll forget their passport, they will forget their luggage,

00:45:51.999 --> 00:45:53.834
they’ll forget this, they are frantic.

00:45:53.999 --> 00:45:56.959
At the airport if you go you’ll find this left Nabhi as we call

00:45:57.125 --> 00:46:00.959
this center is, the spleen goes frantic.

00:46:01.166 --> 00:46:06.041
Now, when you eat your food or do any such work there

00:46:06.291 --> 00:46:08.625
is an emergency created and more blood

00:46:08.875 --> 00:46:12.750
is needed to digest that food. So this spleen, poor thing,

00:46:12.959 --> 00:46:19.291
works very hard to create that extra amount of blood cells.

00:46:19.542 --> 00:46:22.625
But at the time you are eating, you are also, say,

00:46:22.834 --> 00:46:24.375
reading a newspaper, that’s the worst thing

00:46:24.542 --> 00:46:26.750
one should do in the morning. Horrible.

00:46:27.083 --> 00:46:29.500
You read the newspaper, you are eating the food,

00:46:29.834 --> 00:46:33.500
your spleen goes off because another emergency comes up.

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:36.834
Then you get on to your bicycle with a sandwich in the hand,

00:46:37.083 --> 00:46:41.250
is even worse than that. And you are rushing to your work,

00:46:41.542 --> 00:46:43.500
suddenly you find a big jam on the way,

00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:47.041
then you are even very badly placed with the situation,

00:46:47.291 --> 00:46:49.291
and you get so frantic and you don’t understand.

00:46:49.625 --> 00:46:51.542
And the person who is in front of you go on saying,

00:46:51.834 --> 00:46:54.083
“What’s wrong with this fellow, why can’t he drive fast?”

00:46:54.375 --> 00:46:57.875
and the same fellow is saying something exactly the same

00:46:58.083 --> 00:47:00.625
to the another fellow who is going ahead.

00:47:00.834 --> 00:47:03.625
So this madness is on, this rat race is on and if you are

00:47:03.875 --> 00:47:08.709
eating your food in such a hurry and with such franticness,

00:47:09.166 --> 00:47:11.999
you develop this trouble which is very dangerous called

00:47:12.250 --> 00:47:17.083
as blood cancer, and among young people is very common.

00:47:17.667 --> 00:47:23.999
Now, the last and not the least is the trouble of the heart.

00:47:25.667 --> 00:47:29.500
When you pay too much attention to all these outward things,

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:35.417
to material things, to your all material advancement,

00:47:35.875 --> 00:47:40.250
to your physical advancement and to so much of a

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.875
computerization of your brain, then you neglect the

00:47:44.041 --> 00:47:47.417
necessary attention to your Spirit which resides

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:53.083
in your heart; and so the Spirit recedes, and when the Spirit

00:47:53.375 --> 00:47:55.750
recedes you get a heart attack.

00:47:56.041 --> 00:47:58.750
Only a person who is right sided gets a heart attack,

00:47:58.999 --> 00:48:01.041
and never a person who is a left sided.

00:48:01.375 --> 00:48:06.083
I told this to a doctor and he told, surprisingly,

00:48:06.291 --> 00:48:11.500
that in a mental hospital you never need a cardiogram,

00:48:11.792 --> 00:48:14.500
you do not need it.  They never get a heart attack.

00:48:14.834 --> 00:48:17.041
A mad man never gets a heart attack, surprisingly.

00:48:17.417 --> 00:48:22.792
A person who is mad is using his heart, his left side,

00:48:23.083 --> 00:48:25.667
his emotions and his heart should go out, but no,

00:48:25.959 --> 00:48:27.750
his brain goes out. Can you imagine?

00:48:27.999 --> 00:48:30.875
And the one who uses the brain, his heart goes out.

00:48:31.083 --> 00:48:33.667
This is a balance created by the nature in us.

00:48:33.959 --> 00:48:37.291
See how cleverly the nature is trying to guide us

00:48:37.625 --> 00:48:40.792
in the center: don’t go to the extremes, keep to the center,

00:48:41.041 --> 00:48:45.500
keep to the center, and then when you are absolutely

00:48:45.792 --> 00:48:51.959
in the center, then you get your evolution very quickly.

00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:55.417
So this is the right side that we have, the futuristic side,

00:48:55.667 --> 00:48:59.959
and as you know we are all very futuristic by temperament.

00:49:00.667 --> 00:49:03.417
This futuristicness cannot be cured by telling,

00:49:03.667 --> 00:49:05.959
“Oh, now, don’t think,” you cannot do it,

00:49:06.166 --> 00:49:08.542
you just cannot do it. If I order you that

00:49:08.875 --> 00:49:12.041
“Now, you better stop planning,” you just can’t do it,

00:49:12.291 --> 00:49:15.208
you can’t help it. You have to do that kind of planning.

00:49:15.542 --> 00:49:18.291
And you find all these plans fail because these plans

00:49:18.625 --> 00:49:21.083
are not related to the plans of the Divine.

00:49:21.333 --> 00:49:24.542
Divine has some other plans while you have some other plans

00:49:24.792 --> 00:49:28.333
and they never combine together, and that’s how you find

00:49:28.625 --> 00:49:31.208
all your plans fail and you are just frustrated,

00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.542
left high and dry.

00:49:32.792 --> 00:49:35.208
You don’t understand how it has happened.

00:49:35.750 --> 00:49:39.625
For your understanding, one has to know that

00:49:39.792 --> 00:49:44.875
there is a Divine Power.  You may like it or not.

00:49:45.083 --> 00:49:47.875
All this living work that is done - millions and millions

00:49:48.083 --> 00:49:52.792
flowers which are becoming fruits, a seed becoming a tree,

00:49:53.041 --> 00:49:55.291
a particular seed becomes a particular tree,

00:49:55.542 --> 00:49:57.208
all the choices that are made, the whole organized way

00:49:58.917 --> 00:50:03.291
the chemical acts, the way the chemistry is made

00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:06.333
of periodic laws - everything you see in this world

00:50:06.667 --> 00:50:09.999
is all so well organized, there has to be somebody doing it.

00:50:10.291 --> 00:50:12.917
So there is a Divine Power which is surrounding us,

00:50:13.166 --> 00:50:16.667
no doubt about it. But we have not yet felt it, that’s all.

00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:19.291
If we have not felt it that doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist.

00:50:19.625 --> 00:50:23.208
It does exist and it works out. We have seen with our own

00:50:23.458 --> 00:50:25.917
experience that so many living things are happening.

00:50:26.166 --> 00:50:28.041
We just take it for granted, we are not bothered.

00:50:28.417 --> 00:50:32.166
See, in human life itself, a child is to be born,

00:50:32.417 --> 00:50:35.208
then a fetus is held in the body.

00:50:35.542 --> 00:50:38.875
Normally the law of medical science is this:

00:50:39.083 --> 00:50:41.166
that anything foreign, if it enters into the body,

00:50:41.333 --> 00:50:44.208
is thrown away immediately, all the forces

00:50:44.542 --> 00:50:45.792
are built up to throw it away.

00:50:46.083 --> 00:50:49.667
But what we find that when a fetus is built up the whole

00:50:50.041 --> 00:50:53.333
system works out to nourish it, to look after it,

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.291
to really to bother about it.

00:50:55.625 --> 00:50:59.208
Very carefully the water is created around it so that

00:50:59.542 --> 00:51:02.208
it is not disturbed, and every sort of a care is taken

00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:04.291
by the body to look after the fetus,

00:51:04.625 --> 00:51:09.542
and when the fetus is ready, it is thrown out.

00:51:09.792 --> 00:51:12.333
Who does that? Who does that?

00:51:12.625 --> 00:51:14.542
We must ask these questions to ourselves sometimes.

00:51:14.875 --> 00:51:18.083
After all why have we become human beings?

00:51:18.417 --> 00:51:21.208
What was the need? What was the need?

00:51:21.458 --> 00:51:23.542
And if we haven’t got the answer that means we are still in

00:51:23.792 --> 00:51:27.999
transition, and we have to get there where we get the answer.

00:51:28.291 --> 00:51:33.999
We are made humans beings to feel that Divine Power,

00:51:34.875 --> 00:51:37.458
to maneuver that Divine Power and thus

00:51:37.750 --> 00:51:43.875
enjoy the bliss of divinity. That Divine Power is

00:51:44.166 --> 00:51:47.542
the Collective Being, that gives us collectivity.

00:51:47.792 --> 00:51:50.583
The Spirit in our heart is the one which is the

00:51:50.792 --> 00:51:53.291
Collective Being within us, which manifests that

00:51:53.542 --> 00:51:56.291
Divine Power to flow through us.

00:51:56.999 --> 00:51:59.583
And that’s how, once we are connected to the mains,

00:51:59.999 --> 00:52:04.917
we start becoming what we are for. Like a machine,

00:52:05.208 --> 00:52:08.917
once it is put to the mains it gets its meaning;

00:52:09.166 --> 00:52:11.083
but this machine, though it is put to the mains,

00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:15.458
is not aware of the electricity, about My voice, anything.

00:52:15.750 --> 00:52:19.999
But a human being, when he gets connected with the mains,

00:52:20.208 --> 00:52:23.917
then he becomes aware and this is what you must see.

00:52:24.166 --> 00:52:28.917
When you get realized you can raise the Kundalini of others,

00:52:29.291 --> 00:52:31.125
you can give Realization to others.

00:52:31.417 --> 00:52:34.417
Ray himself has done to so many. Even in Riyadh, he did it.

00:52:34.667 --> 00:52:36.542
He did it everywhere wherever he went.

00:52:36.709 --> 00:52:39.917
He’s just like you, he’s an engineer, he’s just like you,

00:52:40.166 --> 00:52:42.542
he was just like you, and now you’ll be amazed that

00:52:42.875 --> 00:52:46.333
how much he knows about himself and about others.

00:52:46.583 --> 00:52:50.417
And a complete change has come because once you get

00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:52.542
the Spirit, when you get the highest,

00:52:52.792 --> 00:52:54.750
all these mundane things drop out and you

00:52:55.083 --> 00:52:58.542
become a master of yourself. No more enslavement of any

00:52:58.792 --> 00:53:01.792
habits or anything, it just works out beautifully.

00:53:01.999 --> 00:53:03.917
But one must give a chance to oneself and one

00:53:04.125 --> 00:53:08.917
must have patience. The worst part of intelligence, so-called,

00:53:09.083 --> 00:53:12.750
is that you can make fun of everything. That’s the easiest way,

00:53:12.917 --> 00:53:16.125
to make fun of everything and get rid of it.

00:53:16.417 --> 00:53:19.250
In olden times when they wanted to face the reality,

00:53:19.458 --> 00:53:21.458
like when Christ came in, they didn’t make fun of Him.

00:53:21.709 --> 00:53:24.083
But they did at the time when He was crucified,

00:53:24.333 --> 00:53:28.709
but they just denied. But now it is not basically problem,

00:53:28.999 --> 00:53:32.417
that problem doesn’t exist because to deny, you see,

00:53:32.542 --> 00:53:35.542
it requires more effort, so is better to make fun.

00:53:35.792 --> 00:53:39.417
Is stupidity, again as I said, is stupidity to make fun

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:43.792
of something because you are that, you are the Spirit.

00:53:43.999 --> 00:53:46.792
You are the one who has to get it and if you just know

00:53:46.999 --> 00:53:49.542
how to make fun, please go and play about with it.

00:53:49.792 --> 00:53:51.417
All your life you’ll go on, all your lives

00:53:51.583 --> 00:53:53.125
you’ll go on, what’s the use?

00:53:53.417 --> 00:53:57.083
And if you do not get your Realization,

00:53:57.583 --> 00:54:02.208
in the words of your judgment you have failed,

00:54:02.542 --> 00:54:05.834
you have failed and there is a chance given to you.

00:54:06.417 --> 00:54:10.458
You can be comforted and you can be counseled,

00:54:10.709 --> 00:54:14.208
you can be redeemed; but nobody can make you taste

00:54:14.458 --> 00:54:18.333
the beauty of your own being, that you have to do it yourself.

00:54:18.542 --> 00:54:22.250
If you do not want to do it, all right.  It’s perfectly all right.

00:54:22.542 --> 00:54:23.917
You are free to do it, do what you like.

00:54:24.125 --> 00:54:28.583
But if you want to do it, then please stop your guru-shopping

00:54:29.125 --> 00:54:32.999
and wobbling, stop and see for yourself what you need.

00:54:33.250 --> 00:54:35.125
It’s a serious thing, which should happen.

00:54:35.458 --> 00:54:37.999
Unless and until human beings are evolved,

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:40.583
none of the problems of the world are going to be solved,

00:54:40.792 --> 00:54:42.333
none of the problems, take it from Me.

00:54:42.667 --> 00:54:44.792
Whatever they have done by their thinking - say they have

00:54:44.999 --> 00:54:49.999
created democracy, they have created communism, this,

00:54:50.208 --> 00:54:54.208
that, all this nonsense, has no meaning at all in reality,

00:54:54.583 --> 00:54:56.999
it has no meaning. Because, say for example you might say

00:54:57.333 --> 00:54:59.834
I’m very powerful so I’m a capitalist.

00:55:00.125 --> 00:55:03.125
But I can’t live without giving to others, so I’m a communist.

00:55:03.375 --> 00:55:06.999
I’m a complete capitalist and a complete communist.

00:55:07.208 --> 00:55:10.834
Everything exists within Me, and these ideas are all artificial

00:55:10.999 --> 00:55:13.375
that you make some set of people as democratic

00:55:13.667 --> 00:55:14.999
and some people as this thing.

00:55:15.250 --> 00:55:18.834
Because as long as they are attached to selfishness, to all

00:55:19.083 --> 00:55:22.792
these things, they are not going to do any good job out of it.

00:55:22.999 --> 00:55:26.083
Now, the detachment takes place because you become

00:55:26.333 --> 00:55:30.458
one with the Spirit, which is not attached,

00:55:30.792 --> 00:55:33.792
which gives you that light, that detachment from where

00:55:34.083 --> 00:55:37.125
you can see the whole thing just as a drama going on.

00:55:37.333 --> 00:55:40.083
And you work it out very well. You become so dynamic,

00:55:40.250 --> 00:55:42.667
so dynamic that you are amazed at your own dynamism.

00:55:43.542 --> 00:55:46.542
Apart from that, one has to realize if there is a Power,

00:55:46.917 --> 00:55:50.542
which is an all-pervading Power, that Power itself thinks,

00:55:50.792 --> 00:55:53.250
organizes and looks after you.

00:55:53.917 --> 00:55:57.458
So many things have happened to Sahaja Yogis that if

00:55:57.709 --> 00:56:00.375
I have to tell you all about it, you’ll be amazed.

00:56:00.667 --> 00:56:01.999
Amazing things have happened.

00:56:02.208 --> 00:56:05.792
But Krishna has said very clearly, “yogakshema vahamyaham,”

00:56:05.999 --> 00:56:10.375
means “When you get the yoga, you’ll get the well being.”

00:56:10.709 --> 00:56:14.208
After yoga. He said yoga first, first the union must take place,

00:56:14.458 --> 00:56:16.333
then you’ll get the well being.

00:56:16.583 --> 00:56:19.125
Now I’ve seen people who go to so-called gurus and things,

00:56:19.208 --> 00:56:23.667
sick, you see their faces pale, absolutely finished,

00:56:23.917 --> 00:56:26.500
they are good for nothing, absolutely miserable people.

00:56:26.667 --> 00:56:29.667
And how such people could be in yoga?

00:56:29.959 --> 00:56:32.959
Not only physically, mentally they are at peace,

00:56:33.083 --> 00:56:34.542
they are full of compassion and love.

00:56:34.667 --> 00:56:37.917
And the compassion that doesn’t talk, but just flows, it flows,

00:56:38.166 --> 00:56:41.375
it emits, you can give your compassion even to flowers.

00:56:41.625 --> 00:56:44.041
If the flowers are dying, you can give them this and

00:56:44.208 --> 00:56:46.417
they will live for a while.  If there are, say,

00:56:46.667 --> 00:56:49.291
trees which are dying, if you give them they will prosper.

00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.333
If you give it to animals, they’ll be different because

00:56:51.667 --> 00:56:55.208
first time, after getting this power only, you are giving

00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:57.166
back something to the nature.

00:56:57.417 --> 00:57:00.083
So far you have been always taking from the nature.

00:57:00.333 --> 00:57:01.667
Now it is the first time you start giving

00:57:01.875 --> 00:57:04.917
something to the nature. Because the compassion just flows,

00:57:05.208 --> 00:57:08.542
it doesn’t receive anything, it just flows to others

00:57:08.875 --> 00:57:10.291
and this should happen to you.

00:57:10.542 --> 00:57:13.500
Don’t be satisfied with cheap things, with something nonsensical,

00:57:13.875 --> 00:57:20.667
which is something sort of a mimicry or a mass ideas.

00:57:20.875 --> 00:57:24.792
I am talking of collectivity where every individual is aware.

00:57:25.083 --> 00:57:29.999
It’s not a mass activity, it is collectivity. May God bless you.

00:57:30.166 --> 00:57:33.917
I hope today many will get Realization and become one

00:57:34.208 --> 00:57:36.999
with their Spirits and will feel their collectivity.

00:57:37.208 --> 00:57:40.875
That’s only My hope is. Brighton I place very high up in

00:57:41.083 --> 00:57:43.917
England and I always said England is the heart of the universe.

00:57:44.166 --> 00:57:47.333
It is very important that it is the heart, no doubt,

00:57:47.625 --> 00:57:50.542
and that’s why Blake has said that it has to become Jerusalem.

00:57:50.792 --> 00:57:52.083
There’s lot of truth in what he has said.

00:57:52.333 --> 00:57:54.083
Lots of things he has said about Sahaja Yoga

00:57:54.333 --> 00:57:58.875
is absolutely proved. But the heart is sluggish.

00:57:59.166 --> 00:58:01.792
Heart is sleeping, is a sad thing.

00:58:02.083 --> 00:58:06.875
Like I say that Europe is the liver and it is drinking,

00:58:07.083 --> 00:58:09.458
can you imagine what will be the state of affairs of this,

00:58:09.667 --> 00:58:13.667
universe, if everything is going against one’s own essence?

00:58:13.875 --> 00:58:17.875
And the essence of English is that it is the heart.

00:58:18.083 --> 00:58:20.999
That means it articulates, it circulates.

00:58:21.333 --> 00:58:23.999
Whatever happens in England is taken up seriously.

00:58:24.208 --> 00:58:26.750
Supposing you become, all of you, stupid people,

00:58:26.999 --> 00:58:28.208
the whole world will become.

00:58:28.458 --> 00:58:30.333
The responsibility is such a lot on you,

00:58:30.625 --> 00:58:31.875
which you do not realize.

00:58:32.083 --> 00:58:34.333
It’s a very important thing that we are doing.

00:58:34.667 --> 00:58:38.208
It looks very small in this country because there are very

00:58:38.458 --> 00:58:41.208
few people who really come to Sahaja Yoga and settle down.

00:58:41.458 --> 00:58:44.625
Very few people, there are very few of that caliber I think.

00:58:44.875 --> 00:58:47.333
Young little children are there, many will come up

00:58:47.625 --> 00:58:49.417
by about, say, ten years or so.

00:58:49.625 --> 00:58:53.208
I’m sure there will be a very good quality of people

00:58:53.417 --> 00:58:55.291
who will be coming and the seekers who are here,

00:58:55.542 --> 00:58:58.333
are also sort of little nervous because they want to learn

00:58:58.583 --> 00:59:00.417
from Americans and from Europeans.

00:59:00.667 --> 00:59:01.917
There’s nothing to be learned from them.

00:59:02.166 --> 00:59:04.083
It is you who are going to circulate;

00:59:04.291 --> 00:59:05.667
you are going to carry the message.

00:59:05.917 --> 00:59:08.999
I know it’s a very important country, and somehow it was

00:59:09.166 --> 00:59:11.750
managed that My husband could get his election

00:59:11.999 --> 00:59:13.625
done in England and we are here now

00:59:13.792 --> 00:59:15.458
for last eight years, can you believe it?

00:59:15.792 --> 00:59:20.208
And I’ll be here maybe again four years more, at the most.

00:59:20.458 --> 00:59:23.208
So I hope something will happen and this Brighton,

00:59:23.542 --> 00:59:28.583
which is a very good place, I’m sure here also many will get

00:59:28.917 --> 00:59:31.208
their Realization and will help

00:59:31.458 --> 00:59:33.875
in the emancipation of human beings.

00:59:34.083 --> 00:59:37.166
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

00:59:37.417 --> 00:59:50.083
If you have any questions you must ask Me.

00:59:50.417 --> 00:59:53.125
In all frankness I must tell you I’m your Mother;

00:59:53.417 --> 00:59:56.583
I never feel offended you ask Me a question.

00:59:56.875 --> 00:59:59.291
Is important because, actually, I have no question.

00:59:59.542 --> 01:00:00.999
You have to ask Me, I have no question at all.
