WEBVTT

00:14.251 --> 00:21.389
Face yourself for becoming.

00:27.002 --> 00:41.666
Then the preparation is done to become
something

00:43.835 --> 00:48.765
and on the whole, when you know that
it is your ego and superego

00:48.966 --> 00:52.567
which are loading you up,

00:53.281 --> 00:58.476
you have to scan them out with vibratory
awareness.

01:03.041 --> 01:15.686
Now there are two types of attention
we have to pay.

01:15.887 --> 01:22.518
First is a constant attention that is
a routine of a Sahaja Yogi,

01:22.719 --> 01:27.848
and the second one is the emergency
attention.

01:31.251 --> 01:38.009
I have been saying that all the Sahaja
Yogis must start writing their diaries:

01:39.259 --> 01:43.884
one with every day’s experiences,

01:44.085 --> 01:49.677
if you know that you have to write a diary,
you’ll keep your mind alert,

01:50.280 --> 01:52.223
and another one whenever you get

01:52.432 --> 01:57.487
any special idea of the past or
of the future, also to jot it down.

01:57.688 --> 02:00.886
So, like that, you should have two diaries.

02:01.087 --> 02:05.042
For your constant attention, you have
to fix up your mind

02:05.243 --> 02:12.604
on certain facts. The first one, as I
said, that if you keep a diary

02:12.805 --> 02:18.368
then you will know that you have to remember
what important things have happened.

02:18.569 --> 02:23.189
So your attention will be alert and you
will be looking out for such points,

02:23.390 --> 02:26.433
where, what is the thing you see.

02:26.634 --> 02:29.669
And you’ll be amazed, if you make
your attention alert,

02:29.870 --> 02:37.783
what new things come to you – very
brilliant ideas.

02:37.984 --> 02:45.902
And the miracles of life and the miracles
of God’s beauty and His auspiciousness,

02:46.103 --> 02:49.133
His greatness, His kindness, His
blessings –

02:49.334 --> 02:51.523
how they work out if you start writing
every day

02:51.724 --> 02:54.752
even two lines about it.

02:54.953 --> 02:59.742
It will make your mind constantly involved
with it.

02:59.943 --> 03:03.767
That’s a human style of doing things.

03:04.382 --> 03:09.645
Also you can mention in the diary

03:11.157 --> 03:13.864
what happened: did you, could you do
your meditation?

03:14.065 --> 03:16.625
Did you get your time for meditation
or not?

03:16.826 --> 03:23.674
A little bit as if you are appearing for
some sort of a examination or something,

03:23.875 --> 03:29.269
you prepare a little note like that: “Did I
get up in the morning? Did I?”

03:29.470 --> 03:33.719
Then any special path

03:33.942 --> 03:40.273
or any special movement in the centre
or left or right also should be mentioned

03:40.474 --> 03:42.839
so that you keep a watch on your mind.

03:43.075 --> 03:46.546
It’s a very good thing to maintain a diary.

03:46.760 --> 03:52.021
Also, you will see progressively how
your ideas are changing,

03:52.222 --> 03:54.817
how new priorities are settling down,

03:55.018 --> 03:59.212
how you give more importance to real things

03:59.413 --> 04:03.442
and very little to unreal things.

04:04.320 --> 04:07.604
I think this is a very, very practical side
of human beings

04:07.805 --> 04:10.143
that one should have a diary.

04:10.344 --> 04:15.374
[The] same diaries, after some times,
will become historical things

04:15.575 --> 04:19.216
and people would like to see what you
all have written.

04:19.417 --> 04:24.627
Not to be hypocritical about it or
deceptive about it,

04:24.828 --> 04:28.718
but quite truthful and understanding.

04:28.919 --> 04:34.758
You should jot down few lines just
before sleeping.

04:36.612 --> 04:44.638
Now we have to see that we have problems
for superego and ego.

04:44.839 --> 04:48.930
Now superego is the left side, is darkness,

04:49.131 --> 04:53.601
tamo guna and our past.

04:53.802 --> 04:57.996
Those who have left side problems should
think of the future,

04:58.197 --> 05:01.779
it gives them balancing if they think
of the future.

05:01.980 --> 05:11.229
For example, a person who is lethargic
should take to working.

05:11.430 --> 05:14.382
Put your mind into working for the future
planning:

05:14.583 --> 05:17.373
what to do, where to go, how to do.

05:17.574 --> 05:25.215
That will keep you away from [the] drag
of the left side

05:25.416 --> 05:31.543
and gradually then you can balance
yourself also.

05:35.132 --> 05:45.559
Now the right side of a person, when it is
activated very much,

05:46.625 --> 05:55.181
he has to balance it, not with the left
side but with the centre.

05:55.381 --> 06:00.175
That is, a person who is very hard-working

06:02.810 --> 06:06.833
must develop a witness state.

06:07.799 --> 06:12.323
You try to do a work, any work,

06:12.524 --> 06:19.841
indulge into work in thoughtless awareness,
as a witness.

06:20.321 --> 06:26.795
Whatever work you are doing you just say
that: “I am not doing it.”

06:26.996 --> 06:29.283
This you can do it after Realisation.

06:29.484 --> 06:34.080
You become thoughtlessly aware and start
doing your work.

06:34.281 --> 06:38.852
So the compensation of the left side is
done by movement to the right,

06:39.053 --> 06:41.624
and of the right side [by] movement
in the centre.

06:41.825 --> 06:45.168
Left side is the tamo guna, right side
is the rajo guna,

06:45.369 --> 06:50.161
and the centre is the sattwa guna. But
still these are three gunas.

06:50.362 --> 06:53.541
That’s not the state which you have
to achieve.

06:53.742 --> 06:58.538
About this I’ll tell you tomorrow more,
how to go further then.

06:59.157 --> 07:03.179
After scanning out which side is weak,

07:03.380 --> 07:07.170
you should plan out your style of life.

07:07.371 --> 07:11.671
For example, if you are extremely lethargic,
you cannot get up in the morning,

07:11.872 --> 07:15.748
you feel very sleepy in the night, you do
not feel alerted,

07:15.949 --> 07:19.846
then start planning as to what will you do,
how will you get up.

07:20.047 --> 07:22.498
Even puja is a good idea, hom [homa,
havan] is a good idea.

07:22.698 --> 07:26.133
Do something like that, you see, so that
you have to do something,

07:26.334 --> 07:29.865
what you call the kriya, is the action,
get into the action.

07:30.066 --> 07:34.498
Some sort of an action you go into
in Sahaja Yoga

07:34.699 --> 07:37.648
as well as in your daily life,

07:37.849 --> 07:41.931
[then] you’ll be able to change that mood
and come to the right side.

07:42.132 --> 07:46.899
And then you go to the, your movement
should be towards the sattwa guna,

07:47.100 --> 07:50.143
is to watch everything.

07:50.845 --> 07:55.567
Now at the sattwa guna point, where you
are in the centre,

07:56.948 --> 08:03.874
you have to see how much you are
misidentified.

08:04.075 --> 08:10.128
Say, supposing you are at the first stage
of left side,

08:10.329 --> 08:14.776
then you will just do daydreaming, “Oh!
This person is so much identified,

08:14.977 --> 08:17.645
that one is so much identified,” as if you
are the best.

08:17.860 --> 08:19.892
It’s just human nature, you see.

08:20.093 --> 08:22.176
“Oh, that person is like that, he is like
that,

08:22.377 --> 08:26.882
this is very bad in the society, that is
going bad in the society. It’s better…”

08:27.083 --> 08:30.334
Then we can also go to this limit is to,
“That guru is very bad

08:30.535 --> 08:34.120
and that one is another madcap.” Like that,
you see, is all daydreaming going on.

08:34.321 --> 08:37.604
How far it is affecting you, how far are
you improving by that is not…

08:37.805 --> 08:42.436
It’s just, you see, thinking, analysing.
See, it’s a lazy stuff,

08:42.637 --> 08:45.959
sitting down and just analysing, it’s
a lazy stuff.

08:46.160 --> 08:48.848
The second thing could be

08:49.049 --> 08:52.793
when you come to the second side of it,
is the kriya.

08:52.994 --> 08:56.520
Then what happens when you start doing it,

08:56.721 --> 08:59.813
then at least your attention is on what
you are doing.

09:00.014 --> 09:03.994
It’s not allowed to drift into something
and which goes into any nonsense and can -

09:04.195 --> 09:08.029
I mean, then you don’t know from where
the funny thoughts are coming.

09:08.230 --> 09:09.642
So, you start doing something.

09:09.843 --> 09:14.543
You can go and plant some trees, or you
can go and plant some flowers,

09:14.744 --> 09:17.238
or if you want you can do some cooking,
you can do some work.

09:17.439 --> 09:21.462
Take to work! That will help you. Any work.

09:21.663 --> 09:26.522
But while doing the work the problem
will be, you’ll develop ego.

09:26.723 --> 09:31.986
That’s why when you are developing the ego
you have to tell yourself,

09:32.187 --> 09:34.974
“You are not doing, mister. This you are
not doing,

09:35.175 --> 09:37.116
this is not doing, you are not doing.”

09:37.317 --> 09:39.148
If you go on suggesting to yourself
[like this],

09:39.349 --> 09:42.349
Mr. Ego will not come up. And then many
things, you see,

09:42.550 --> 09:44.568
which normally trouble you and trouble
others –

09:44.769 --> 09:47.527
like you have cleaned the room, all right.

09:47.728 --> 09:51.541
Then [if] somebody comes and spoils it,
you get angry with that person.

09:51.742 --> 09:54.914
Naturally! Because you think ‘you’ have
done.

09:55.115 --> 09:58.078
First of all, you don’t clean the room.
If you clean the room then you be prepared,

09:58.279 --> 10:02.273
it will be dirtied, otherwise why should
you clean?

10:02.957 --> 10:09.020
Now, if it is dirty, well and good; if it
is not dirtied, well and good.

10:09.480 --> 10:12.787
This type of an attitude you should take

10:12.988 --> 10:17.719
to jump on to sattwa guna. On sattwa
guna you start accepting it.

10:17.920 --> 10:22.890
You become extremely mild. You become
a mild personality.

10:23.091 --> 10:28.056
Then at that time you do not discuss as to,
“Oh, I don’t like it;

10:28.257 --> 10:30.280
this was wrong; this should not have been.”

10:30.480 --> 10:32.783
All these things do not come to you
in sattwa guna.

10:32.983 --> 10:36.529
You start seeing it. That time you see
[it] that,

10:36.731 --> 10:39.436
“All right, doesn’t matter. It’s done,
it’s done.”

10:39.650 --> 10:43.637
On the contrary, you feel hurt, if you are
a sattwa guni,

10:43.838 --> 10:50.419
that by any suggestion you have suggested
your ego.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.735
Can you get that point?

10:52.965 --> 10:56.522
You feel ashamed of your ego, I mean
to say, if you are a sattwa guni.

10:56.723 --> 11:00.217
For example, even to say that, “This is
my car,” you will feel shy.

11:00.418 --> 11:02.465
That’s a sattwa guni style.

11:02.666 --> 11:04.705
Or even to say, “Why did you spoil
my carpet?”

11:04.906 --> 11:07.058
I mean in India nobody will say, I can tell
you this [much].

11:07.259 --> 11:09.925
Is regarded [as] bad manners, absolute
bad manners.

11:10.126 --> 11:11.807
If anybody comes to your house and
the carpet is spoiled,

11:12.008 --> 11:13.072
they say, “Let it be, doesn’t matter.”

11:13.273 --> 11:17.335
Even it is burnt, “I don’t know. Let it be.
Are you burnt?”

11:17.536 --> 11:20.699
They’ll never say that, “You have burnt
my carpet, or done anything to my…”

11:20.900 --> 11:23.310
Is regarded [as] bad manners.

11:23.511 --> 11:28.050
Like here, you see, if somebody’s sleeping
[and] somebody makes the noise.

11:28.250 --> 11:29.922
The person who is sleeping will never
say that,

11:30.123 --> 11:32.845
“You are making noise, and let me get in”.

11:33.046 --> 11:36.898
He’ll just get up and ask, “Do you need
anything?”

11:37.859 --> 11:39.967
That’s difficult for people here
to understand

11:40.168 --> 11:44.881
because ego is just sitting on the head.
But is bad manners there.

11:45.082 --> 11:47.574
You will find when you’ll go to India,
you’ll find this.

11:47.784 --> 11:53.129
These are bad manners to say that. Or
to say, “Oh, I, I feel very comfortable.”

11:53.330 --> 11:55.795
I mean, to say “I feel comfortable” is bad
manners.

11:55.996 --> 11:59.090
I mean, they never say “I like it.”

11:59.291 --> 12:02.408
So what? All these words are not to be
said.

12:02.609 --> 12:05.552
If you are a sattwa guni then you just
don’t say.

12:05.753 --> 12:11.896
You will say, “Do you like it? Is it
comfortable? Would you like to have this?”

12:12.097 --> 12:20.174
The whole attention goes from your side.
Do you understand that?

12:20.730 --> 12:24.192
That is the style one has to develop.
Then you are a sattwa guni.

12:24.393 --> 12:27.284
Otherwise, you are still on an ego trip.
You see, whatever you may say:

12:27.485 --> 12:32.655
“I don’t like that, I don’t…” “I” - who are
you?

12:33.449 --> 12:36.206
First of all, ask the question, “Who are
you?”

12:36.407 --> 12:41.275
If God says, “I don’t like you,” I can
understand, He has the reasons,

12:41.476 --> 12:43.504
but for you to say, “I don’t like it” …

12:43.705 --> 12:47.622
After all, how did you come on this earth?

12:49.173 --> 12:52.262
How did you get a human birth?

12:52.463 --> 12:56.503
How did you get all these things? Now
think like that.

12:56.704 --> 12:59.351
“Who am I?

13:01.787 --> 13:04.316
I am nothing.”

13:04.674 --> 13:07.498
Anybody who thinks, “I am something,”
he should know

13:07.699 --> 13:09.797
that he’s nothing; makes no difference
to God

13:09.998 --> 13:16.091
whether he exists or does not exist,
you see, he’s nothing, he’s just a drop.

13:16.750 --> 13:20.694
So, this point if you understand, that even
if you do something,

13:20.895 --> 13:23.577
any work you do or anything you are doing:

13:23.778 --> 13:29.477
you are just doing it because you want
to do it.

13:31.538 --> 13:34.554
That is how you come on to sattwa guna.

13:34.755 --> 13:37.687
But normally it doesn’t happen. It happens
the other way round.

13:37.888 --> 13:46.862
For example a person is, say, doing
something;

13:47.063 --> 13:49.090
[if] by any chance he feels hurt

13:49.291 --> 13:51.590
or he thinks that whatever he has done
is no good,

13:51.791 --> 13:54.742
people don’t appreciate, or maybe he might
think that,

13:54.943 --> 13:58.800
“Oh, it’s not up to the point,” or whatever
it is.

13:59.001 --> 14:02.909
Then the reaction for him is not that he
does not try to rise to sattwa guna,

14:03.110 --> 14:08.121
but he goes back to tamo guna. “All right,
I’ll not do it.

14:08.322 --> 14:13.316
I’ll sleep over it. Let them do it, why
should I do it?”

14:13.517 --> 14:20.007
So the training that you have to have
through your rajo guna goes a-waste.

14:20.208 --> 14:25.608
It’s just a training period that you are
with rajo guna. You are doing something.

14:25.809 --> 14:33.014
Now in that training period you have to
learn only how to come in the centre.

14:33.215 --> 14:36.832
For example now, water is required for you
to swim.

14:37.033 --> 14:40.600
If there is no water you cannot swim.

14:40.801 --> 14:47.425
All right? In the same way, rajo guna is
required for you to come to sattwa guni.

14:47.626 --> 14:52.343
If you do not do any work, you cannot
come to sattwa guna.

14:52.551 --> 14:57.634
So you are just working just to train
yourself to be a witness.

14:57.835 --> 15:01.853
Now do you follow that point? You are not
doing it because you like particular thing,

15:02.054 --> 15:04.990
you are used to particular thing, because
you want to be this.

15:05.191 --> 15:08.248
This is not the way it is.

15:09.068 --> 15:13.479
You are just doing it to learn how to be
patient.

15:13.680 --> 15:19.944
To practice your patience. To see how
much patient you are.

15:20.145 --> 15:22.791
Once you start doing it, you’ll be amazed

15:22.992 --> 15:27.084
that you will never feel the burden
of the work.

15:28.291 --> 15:31.812
But it never happens. Most of the people,

15:32.013 --> 15:37.358
if they find their work is not effective,
they’ll go back to tamo guna.

15:37.559 --> 15:40.013
There are many attitudes. Say, somebody
is working,

15:40.222 --> 15:43.383
then he thinks, “Why should I do all
the work? Others are not doing!”

15:43.584 --> 15:47.529
He’ll go back to their stage. But those who
are not working will not think that,

15:47.730 --> 15:50.967
“This person is working, let me also work.”

15:51.168 --> 15:54.265
It’s other way round, you see.

15:54.466 --> 15:56.209
This can be an attitude of some people,
that:

15:56.410 --> 16:01.797
“If this person is working, let him work.”

16:01.998 --> 16:06.033
This is even a meaner stuff, [to] avoid,
just.

16:06.234 --> 16:08.936
You go to a restaurant and somebody
takes out the purse,

16:09.137 --> 16:12.204
others start looking this side – is very
mean,

16:12.405 --> 16:17.168
it’s a very mean thing to do. Everybody
should come forward

16:17.369 --> 16:19.339
and once you have paid, you have paid it,
finished.

16:19.540 --> 16:23.362
Then you just don’t start counting, “Why
did I pay?”

16:23.563 --> 16:27.817
Once you try [to do this]. Or any work has
to be done,

16:28.018 --> 16:31.011
go forward with it, do it with your heart.

16:31.212 --> 16:34.284
Don’t worry if others have not done it.

16:34.485 --> 16:37.688
Just do it for its pleasure, and
the pleasure only you will get

16:37.889 --> 16:41.748
when you will do it with the understanding
that it’s a training period,

16:41.949 --> 16:45.858
you are better trained than the other
one is.

16:46.455 --> 16:48.745
You are at a higher class than the other
one is.

16:48.946 --> 16:53.424
So we have to be at a higher class.

16:53.789 --> 16:56.911
For that, this is just a training on.

16:57.112 --> 17:00.164
And that’s how we can really put

17:00.365 --> 17:03.950
our preparation into practice, into
all details

17:04.151 --> 17:09.002
to see how we work out our ego and
superego..

17:09.203 --> 17:11.987
Today, in the morning, I have told you that
your intellect

17:12.188 --> 17:16.901
must imbibe this within itself, all right?

17:17.102 --> 17:24.936
And now I’m telling you that your action,
action that you do,

17:25.150 --> 17:29.926
must be every time branded by you

17:30.127 --> 17:39.059
as just your training – any action you do.

17:39.260 --> 17:44.028
Supposing you have to drive for miles
together, you are trying your patience.

17:44.229 --> 17:47.278
You see, they’ll do in everything. Say they
have to go for, say,

17:47.479 --> 17:51.309
helicopter, or say if they have to drop
from the…

17:51.510 --> 17:53.256
what you call them, they drop down?

17:53.419 --> 17:55.048
Sahaja Yogis: Parachutes.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

17:55.249 --> 17:57.142
Sahaja Yogis: Parachutes.
Shri Mataji: Parachuters.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.407
Or helicopter you take away or whatever
it is.

18:00.608 --> 18:04.880
You go on doing it again and again,
isn’t it? You practice it again and again.

18:05.081 --> 18:07.628
You drop many-a-times, you break your
legs, you break your hands,

18:07.829 --> 18:13.857
you do this and do that, till you become
a master. Do you understand My point?

18:14.058 --> 18:16.999
Driving – same way, till you become
a master, you go on.

18:17.200 --> 18:22.502
In the same way, you are doing this work
just to master your patience.

18:22.703 --> 18:29.501
And then your love, is your love – how
much you love really.

18:29.702 --> 18:34.688
If you really love someone, you are never
tired of working.

18:37.196 --> 18:39.733
You are never upset with work.

18:39.934 --> 18:42.566
But if you don’t love, you’ll start
counting,

18:42.767 --> 18:48.298
“How much money, how much work, how
many hours, how much to be paid?”

18:48.499 --> 18:54.193
All artificiality comes because there is
no love involved in your work.

18:54.394 --> 19:00.319
Whatever you don’t want to do, you don’t
do it, to begin with.

19:00.520 --> 19:05.896
To begin with, you just don’t do what
you don’t like – to begin with.

19:06.097 --> 19:09.745
But once you have mastered that, then
you have to master it

19:09.946 --> 19:13.632
that you do something that you don’t like.

19:13.833 --> 19:16.439
Like meeting some bhooties, for example.

19:16.640 --> 19:19.748
You don’t want to meet, you want to run
away,

19:19.949 --> 19:23.083
but you go little nearer it, you see.

19:23.284 --> 19:25.397
Then develop an immunity for these
bhooties.

19:25.598 --> 19:29.170
After some time, you’ll not catch them.

19:29.835 --> 19:32.227
You have to develop the immunity, isn’t it?

19:32.436 --> 19:37.336
Otherwise one person comes here and
everybody’s head goes out.

19:38.098 --> 19:41.800
Instead of the fellow improving, you all
go out.

19:42.001 --> 19:49.354
So all these things are, all these events
are for your training, your immunity.

19:49.555 --> 19:53.237
Your immunity is to be trained,

19:53.966 --> 19:59.860
and when it is so, when we are training
ourselves, we should take it as a job.

20:01.132 --> 20:06.758
But the attitude should be extremely
positive,

20:06.968 --> 20:09.760
extremely positive

20:09.961 --> 20:15.088
and all that should be expressed in your
notebook:

20:15.289 --> 20:20.858
whether you got dejected or you got upset
and disgusted,

20:21.058 --> 20:28.237
you want to run away from it – all sorts of
things. It’s just a training to your mind.

20:30.131 --> 20:34.725
Whatever is the situation, wherever one
has to live,

20:34.926 --> 20:40.877
whatever one has to do, we should do.

20:41.078 --> 20:46.147
Whatever may be the circumstances,
conditions, you’ll be amazed,

20:46.348 --> 20:48.553
you will not even know what you have
eaten in the morning,

20:48.754 --> 20:53.534
what you have eaten in the evening, whether
you have eaten or not you will not know.

20:53.735 --> 21:01.480
You’ll not fuss about it, you’ll not worry
about it, you’ll not think about it.

21:02.600 --> 21:10.365
But this being the aim, is to reach
to sattwa guna,

21:10.566 --> 21:14.667
every other thing becomes zero.

21:15.995 --> 21:19.192
It’s the greatest hurdle comes to Sahaja
Yogis I’ve seen,

21:19.393 --> 21:22.856
when they start organising.

21:23.057 --> 21:27.259
They start organising something. Now
somebody wants something,

21:27.460 --> 21:31.114
so they’ll run up to get the thing for that
person.

21:31.315 --> 21:34.924
Now, just now I’ve said that you must look
after the needs of others.

21:35.125 --> 21:37.289
But if I am sitting here and there’s
a lecture on,

21:37.490 --> 21:40.631
then you’d better be just listening to Me.

21:40.832 --> 21:44.495
You see, this also is there that: how
to have your priorities,

21:44.696 --> 21:49.354
at this time when something [is] working
on you,

21:49.555 --> 21:52.100
this is the first thing you have to do.

21:52.301 --> 21:57.220
Not that at this time you go and cook.

21:57.421 --> 22:03.465
You have known the story of two sisters
attending on Christ. All right?

22:03.666 --> 22:08.976
So at this time, what is your first job

22:09.177 --> 22:13.075
is to try to be more exposed to Me

22:13.305 --> 22:16.362
so that automatically you’ll go into your
sattwa guna.

22:16.563 --> 22:19.140
This is the best!

22:19.341 --> 22:21.591
But if I am not there,

22:21.792 --> 22:26.303
and when you are alone or when you are
with the other Sahaja Yogis,

22:26.504 --> 22:31.093
you must now compete in rising higher
and higher:

22:31.307 --> 22:35.571
from tamo guna to rajo guna and from rajo
guna to sattwa guna.

22:35.772 --> 22:40.656
But actually, by Realisation you have gone
beyond these three gunas.

22:40.857 --> 22:47.099
You have gone beyond it. Actually, that is
what has happened to you.

22:47.300 --> 22:52.644
But, like clouds, they cover you again
and again.

22:53.162 --> 22:57.197
And when the sky is covered with those
clouds,

22:57.398 --> 23:02.996
you cannot see the sun, you cannot see
the moon, you cannot see the stars.

23:03.197 --> 23:06.576
So we have to know how these clouds
are coming into us

23:06.777 --> 23:10.243
and that’s how we go into our complete
analysis.

23:10.444 --> 23:12.725
How these clouds are coming to us,

23:12.926 --> 23:16.764
we find out about our different chakras,

23:16.965 --> 23:20.596
what are the chakras we are catching.

23:20.985 --> 23:27.364
Here comes the another constant attention,
towards our chakras.

23:27.565 --> 23:33.338
Are our vibrations all right or not? Are we
getting our vibrations?

23:33.539 --> 23:37.858
If not, what chakra am I catching, what
must be the catch?

23:38.059 --> 23:42.269
I must raise my Kundalini, see for myself,
where is the catch.

23:42.470 --> 23:46.545
Do I do my meditation or not? If I do it,
am I doing it just dozingly

23:46.746 --> 23:49.220
or am I really in it?

23:49.421 --> 23:53.837
Am I really feeling it or not? Am I alert
or not?

23:54.038 --> 23:58.519
All this is to be assiduously, sincerely,

23:58.720 --> 24:01.995
absolutely, truthfully should be worked
out.

24:02.196 --> 24:07.009
Because it is a process between your self –

24:07.210 --> 24:09.400
‘Atmanyeva Atmana tushta’ [The Spirit
is satisfied with Itself].

24:09.601 --> 24:13.694
You see, it’s a very funny, it is so funny
relationship

24:13.895 --> 24:21.055
that it is the Atma is satisfied with Atma!

24:21.256 --> 24:24.495
You have to be satisfied with your Self.

24:24.696 --> 24:27.106
There’s nobody, Mataji is not concerned,
nobody is concerned.

24:27.307 --> 24:31.937
It is you who is concerned with your Self.
