1
00:00:07,718 --> 00:00:12,518
(...) God does look after all of us.

2
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:15,478
He is compassion, He is love, He has created us,

3
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:19,078
He has made a beautiful human being out of us,

4
00:00:19,158 --> 00:00:21,158
within us He has placed all these centres,

5
00:00:21,238 --> 00:00:24,478
He has placed the Kundalini within
us, and the Kundalini has to rise,

6
00:00:24,558 --> 00:00:28,798
you have to get realization, all that is so, no doubt.

7
00:00:28,878 --> 00:00:33,678
All this has to work out. That’s also the truth is.

8
00:00:33,758 --> 00:00:40,318
But still, one must know that He is not in your hand,

9
00:00:40,398 --> 00:00:43,278
you are in His hand.

10
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:48,118
There are many people who pray to God: “Give me promotion.

11
00:00:48,198 --> 00:00:51,718
O God, you have to give me promotion”.

12
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:56,718
And then if He doesn’t give, “This God is not helpful to me!

13
00:00:56,798 --> 00:01:02,438
Why has He not given me promotion?”
You should not cheapen God like that.

14
00:01:02,518 --> 00:01:07,678
God is the one Who is Almighty,
Who has created all this Universe.

15
00:01:07,758 --> 00:01:12,518
He has created you, and He has created you for a purpose.

16
00:01:12,598 --> 00:01:18,718
And that purpose is something
Supreme. That’s not ordinary purpose,

17
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:23,198
the way you think Him to be, He is not an ordinary person.

18
00:01:23,278 --> 00:01:27,198
He is Supreme and He will give you something that is Supreme.

19
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:34,838
Supposing you go to see some
king, he will not give you 1p, will he?

20
00:01:36,038 --> 00:01:39,078
He may give you a diamond.

21
00:01:39,158 --> 00:01:46,558
But if you want to ask anything from
God then you must ask for the Supreme!

22
00:01:46,638 --> 00:01:53,518
And what is the Supreme? The Supreme is to know Him.

23
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:59,318
Unless and until you know your
Self, you are not going to know Him.

24
00:01:59,398 --> 00:02:05,358
He has placed within you that instrument
by which you first know your Self.

25
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:11,358
Once you know your Self, through your Self you know Him.

26
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:16,998
But the first important thing is
that your attention has to be on Him.

27
00:02:17,078 --> 00:02:21,838
There’s a very different thing to have attention on God

28
00:02:21,918 --> 00:02:24,678
and to have a blind faith in God.

29
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:30,318
These two things are absolutely far apart.

30
00:02:30,398 --> 00:02:34,118
To have faith in God means – I’ve already told you

31
00:02:34,198 --> 00:02:38,878
all the silly things we do in the name of faith.

32
00:02:38,958 --> 00:02:43,478
But to have your attention on God is

33
00:02:43,558 --> 00:02:48,358
to ask: “When am I going to be my Self?

34
00:02:48,438 --> 00:02:54,078
When are You going to accept me as a citizen of Your Kingdom?

35
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,958
When are You going to use me as Your instrument, O Lord?”

36
00:02:58,038 --> 00:03:01,678
This should be your attention. If your attention is like that,

37
00:03:01,758 --> 00:03:06,318
and if you are really of pure nature about it,

38
00:03:06,398 --> 00:03:09,438
it will work out, it works out.

39
00:03:09,518 --> 00:03:12,198
This is the only thing that is needed in Sahaja Yoga,

40
00:03:12,278 --> 00:03:18,798
is a clean heart to ask for it, to desire for it.

41
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,318
(...) But today, we have to understand one thing:

42
00:03:21,398 --> 00:03:26,958
that the essences within us – for
example innocence – is absolutely pure.

43
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:33,198
Within us it is absolutely pure. In
its own form it is absolutely pure.

44
00:03:33,278 --> 00:03:40,078
But, when it is reflected through our medium, it gets soiled.

45
00:03:40,158 --> 00:03:44,638
The way you are, the way you express it, it gets spoiled.

46
00:03:44,718 --> 00:03:49,878
If you are a cunning person, the innocence cannot be manifested,

47
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:54,678
it cannot be manifested. Your innocence,
whatever God has placed within you

48
00:03:54,758 --> 00:03:59,358
is completely darkened because you cannot reflect it back.

49
00:03:59,438 --> 00:04:05,038
There is no manifestation about it. Why it happens?

50
00:04:05,118 --> 00:04:11,118
If you are pure, if you are all
right, the innocence is all right,

51
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:14,398
then why it is not manifested through you?

52
00:04:14,478 --> 00:04:18,798
Why this cunningness can stop
that innocence or any other essences

53
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:23,598
that are within you, which you
know which exist on different chakras?

54
00:04:23,678 --> 00:04:30,158
We must think about it, why it
happens. That even after realization,

55
00:04:30,238 --> 00:04:34,278
we cannot properly manifest our innocence,

56
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:39,638
our primordial powers

57
00:04:39,718 --> 00:04:43,038
which are within us in absolute purest form.

58
00:04:43,118 --> 00:04:50,318
Why? What happens within us? The trouble is with our attention.

59
00:04:50,398 --> 00:04:54,238
When you became human beings, you were given full freedom

60
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:58,478
to put your attention onto anything you wanted.

61
00:04:58,558 --> 00:05:05,398
Say, if you want, you can put your attention onto any subject.

62
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:09,638
Say I receive a telephone call. So I put my attention to it.

63
00:05:09,718 --> 00:05:12,238
Now, I can go on identifying with it, thinking about it;

64
00:05:12,318 --> 00:05:15,358
all my attention will be enveloped and I will not pay attention

65
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:19,198
to anything else that is happening.

66
00:05:20,478 --> 00:05:23,998
The attention is so mobile, it has no base

67
00:05:24,078 --> 00:05:28,878
as if the whole thing, like a jelly,
goes and gets attached to a thing.

68
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:32,398
(...) I mean if you waste your
attention on foolish nonsensical things,

69
00:05:32,478 --> 00:05:36,398
what’s going to happen?

70
00:05:36,478 --> 00:05:39,118
So this is how we put our attention

71
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:46,598
onto absolutely useless things;
sometimes onto very depraved things also.

72
00:05:46,678 --> 00:05:49,318
We may put our attention to anything

73
00:05:49,398 --> 00:05:57,518
that we think “requires our attention”.
But do you have your self-esteem?

74
00:05:57,598 --> 00:06:02,238
If you have, then where should be your attention?

75
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:07,798
It should be on your Self. Where is your Self now?

76
00:06:07,878 --> 00:06:15,638
It is God Almighty. Is a part of that Great Primordial Being.

77
00:06:15,718 --> 00:06:20,878
Your attention should be on That.

78
00:06:20,958 --> 00:06:26,398
After realization, your attention should be in your heart,

79
00:06:26,478 --> 00:06:32,518
on your Spirit, which is the part of God Almighty.

80
00:06:32,598 --> 00:06:39,838
If your attention is on your Spirit, you’ll
be amazed, how your attention will act.

81
00:06:39,918 --> 00:06:42,958
You see, like a jelly which is attached to a point.

82
00:06:43,038 --> 00:06:46,078
It may little bit get disturbed, again it will settle down.

83
00:06:46,158 --> 00:06:48,678
Again, it will get little bit disturbed, it will settle down.

84
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:54,798
It will not hang on to any point, and will not bother you.

85
00:06:54,878 --> 00:06:58,278
So to put all your essences properly, first of all,

86
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:03,198
put your attention to your heart and to your Spirit,

87
00:07:03,278 --> 00:07:06,958
because that’s your absolute point which you have discovered.

88
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,358
But it doesn’t happen with many people.

89
00:07:09,438 --> 00:07:14,838
The trouble is, when Kundalini rises,
She gives two kinds of experiences.

90
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:18,758
One is called as Shambhavi, another called as Shakti.

91
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:26,358
Shambhavi is the feeling of the Shambhu, is
the Shiva in the heart, means God Almighty.

92
00:07:26,438 --> 00:07:29,078
But the other is Shakti.

93
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:34,158
Now with western people it is the
other, because you know your problems.

94
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:40,718
You have used your powers for all
kinds of ramblings in your mental efforts.

95
00:07:40,798 --> 00:07:43,718
Everything [Everyone] will sit down.
“All right, let us discuss realization!”

96
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:46,958
What are you going to discuss?

97
00:07:48,558 --> 00:07:51,678
What are you going to discuss about realization?

98
00:07:51,758 --> 00:07:55,998
Did you get your realization by discussion?

99
00:07:56,078 --> 00:08:00,798
You have to meditate! You have to go within yourselves.

100
00:08:00,878 --> 00:08:04,038
See your growth, work out within!

101
00:08:04,118 --> 00:08:06,598
You cannot talk about it, you cannot discuss it,

102
00:08:06,678 --> 00:08:10,958
you cannot argue about it – it is within!

103
00:08:11,038 --> 00:08:14,638
Because of these ramblings, we go up to the shakti point.

104
00:08:14,718 --> 00:08:17,558
But Shambhu’s we do not reach.

105
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:20,878
But in the East where people are not that much intelligent,

106
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:26,558
that well-educated and sophisticated, I would say -

107
00:08:26,638 --> 00:08:32,918
simple people, it goes just there. And they just enjoy.

108
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:35,518
If you show them any book, written about Sahaja Yoga –

109
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:37,598
for example Gregoire’s book - they’ll say,

110
00:08:37,678 --> 00:08:41,878
“Mother, we don’t want it, to read, we don’t understand this”.

111
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:44,318
They are just there! They are now there. What is there now?

112
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:47,958
It’s flowing through our body, everything we know it’s there.

113
00:08:48,038 --> 00:08:52,158
Why should we bother about these
things and all the controversies and dogmas,

114
00:08:52,238 --> 00:08:55,558
and what all the Churches have told you, and why they have failed

115
00:08:55,638 --> 00:09:00,718
and why this religion has failed? Who is bothered?!

116
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:03,278
So these problems come up.

117
00:09:03,358 --> 00:09:09,278
Because their attention has been on the Spirit alone.

118
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:13,758
Simple people have that capacity.

119
00:09:13,838 --> 00:09:17,358
So now forgetting everything else, all your intelligence,

120
00:09:17,438 --> 00:09:22,758
all your books and education
and all that you have had – forget it.

121
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:25,678
And just put your attention to your heart,

122
00:09:25,758 --> 00:09:30,918
where lies the connection with God Almighty.

123
00:09:30,998 --> 00:09:33,518
If your attention is there,

124
00:09:33,598 --> 00:09:39,758
you will be surprised that your attention will be stabilised.

125
00:09:39,838 --> 00:09:47,038
Not only that it will be stabilised,
but the source of joy is that

126
00:09:47,118 --> 00:09:51,318
and you will start feeling that joy.

127
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:54,358
(...) But if you want to co-operate and help yourself,

128
00:09:54,438 --> 00:09:58,198
then you have to put your attention in such a way

129
00:09:58,278 --> 00:10:04,638
that – every problem comes in –
you go to your heart, not to your brain.

130
00:10:04,718 --> 00:10:07,118
Any question comes in, go to your heart.

131
00:10:07,198 --> 00:10:12,278
There resides the blessings of God. And
you will be surprised how it will be solved.

132
00:10:12,358 --> 00:10:15,078
That’s why I said “Go into thoughtless awareness.”

133
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:19,878
That is the quality of heart, because heart doesn’t think.

134
00:10:21,118 --> 00:10:27,038
You go to your heart, means
you put your attention to your Spirit.

135
00:10:27,118 --> 00:10:29,718
(...) You Sahaja Yogis have to be people

136
00:10:29,798 --> 00:10:37,118
of higher outward manifestation. Inside you are,

137
00:10:37,198 --> 00:10:41,278
but outward manifestation has to be higher.

138
00:10:41,358 --> 00:10:47,998
You have to be humbler people, kinder people, sweeter people,

139
00:10:48,078 --> 00:10:52,518
loving people, compassionate, understanding

140
00:10:52,598 --> 00:11:01,158
that you were there, where they are
today; joyous people and cheerful people.

141
00:11:01,238 --> 00:11:04,118
Otherwise nobody is going to believe what is happening

142
00:11:04,198 --> 00:11:06,838
in the Kundalini inside, because whatever is happening

143
00:11:06,918 --> 00:11:10,158
is happening, you cannot see that.

144
00:11:10,238 --> 00:11:13,678
It is important that it should be evident on your face,

145
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:18,918
in your behaviour, in everything. For that you have to understand

146
00:11:18,998 --> 00:11:25,678
that you have to stabilise your
attention at the lotus feet of God.

147
00:11:25,758 --> 00:11:28,278
This is called as ‘Sharanagati’ – surrendering.

148
00:11:28,358 --> 00:11:35,958
By surrendering, by worshipping, by bhakti, by singing songs,

149
00:11:36,038 --> 00:11:42,598
by absolutely settling yourself
at the lotus feet of God Almighty.

150
00:11:42,678 --> 00:11:45,318
That’s the only way you are going to achieve it.

151
00:11:45,398 --> 00:11:50,758
After realization only, you have
the entry into the Kingdom of God.

152
00:11:50,838 --> 00:11:53,718
Before that, whatever you try has no meaning.

153
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:58,438
Muslims do all the Namaz, morning
till evening – do not get anything!

154
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:00,558
But we had some Muslims, you know that.

155
00:12:00,638 --> 00:12:03,238
Once he started after realization, he said,

156
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:06,078
“Every time I bend I get vibrations. Every time I say

157
00:12:06,158 --> 00:12:10,078
Allah’s name I get vibration.” It has happened with all of them.

158
00:12:10,158 --> 00:12:16,758
Because God exists, He is there, it’s a fact.

159
00:12:16,838 --> 00:12:22,358
And the time has come for all of us to feel Him and know Him.

160
00:12:22,438 --> 00:12:26,318
(...) Please put your attention to your heart.

161
00:12:28,158 --> 00:12:31,478
(...) Yogini: Mother, when you
said ‘Put your attention on your heart’

162
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:35,478
do you mean the heart chakra? ”
Shri Mataji: You cannot feel heart.

163
00:12:35,558 --> 00:12:37,878
You cannot know heart chakra, nothing!

164
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:41,998
When I say that, just say that,
‘I’m putting My attention to My Spirit’,

165
00:12:42,078 --> 00:12:45,478
that’s all. Your saying is a mantra itself.

166
00:12:45,558 --> 00:12:48,318
You know now you are a realised soul.

167
00:12:48,398 --> 00:12:52,398
You are an enlightened person, your desire is enlightened.

168
00:12:52,478 --> 00:12:58,158
And if you just say that ‘My
attention is on my Spirit in my heart,

169
00:12:58,238 --> 00:13:01,638
in the organ of heart…’

170
00:13:07,758 --> 00:13:12,638
You see now, whatever you say has a meaning.

171
00:13:12,718 --> 00:13:18,118
Do you understand? Whatever you
say is enlightened now, there’s a light in it.

172
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,598
Only thing is, if your attention is not all right still,

173
00:13:21,678 --> 00:13:29,878
then the light is still dim. If in the dim
light, you see half things, but you do see.

174
00:13:29,958 --> 00:13:32,958
But if it is a bright light you can see it very clearly.

175
00:13:33,038 --> 00:13:39,798
So to brighten up the light, you
just say that, “Let me be in my heart.”

176
00:13:39,878 --> 00:13:43,958
It works out, settles down, you see?

177
00:13:44,038 --> 00:13:46,678
As if you order your attention to be there.

178
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:50,598
It just goes like a, like a sweet little baby, you see.

179
00:13:50,678 --> 00:13:53,518
Sits down there, “All right, Mother, whatever you say.”

180
00:13:53,598 --> 00:13:57,078
Just say like that. Just try to feel your powers.

181
00:13:57,158 --> 00:14:01,558
What you say, how it works out.

182
00:14:01,638 --> 00:14:06,718
Even when you say mantras, these mantras are also enlightened.
