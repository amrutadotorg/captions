03:18:10.183 --> 03:18:20.473
It is very difficult to describe this inner
joy.

03:18:20.682 --> 03:18:25.028
You can only enjoy it, you can only
feel it.

03:18:25.229 --> 03:18:36.964
It's something so innate to see that
so many of you

03:18:37.165 --> 03:18:41.405
have learnt this difficult music

03:18:41.606 --> 03:18:46.076
and all of you have been enjoying it.

03:18:48.787 --> 03:18:56.830
I went to various places in the West
and I felt that,

03:18:57.032 --> 03:19:01.719
“Why even small little children,

03:19:01.920 --> 03:19:08.254
boys and girls, take to something which is
self-destructive? Why?

03:19:08.455 --> 03:19:10.746
Why do they take to drugs? Why do they take

03:19:10.947 --> 03:19:14.770
Why do they take to all these things which
are self-destructive?”

03:19:14.972 --> 03:19:18.651
I mean, you could blame the parents
to some extent

03:19:18.852 --> 03:19:24.034
but on the whole, there was something
within them which was troubling them,

03:19:24.235 --> 03:19:29.857
which was trying to say that, “That's
not true.

03:19:30.058 --> 03:19:33.618
That's not the thing, that's not the thing
that you want.”

03:19:33.819 --> 03:19:41.079
And that's what made them go into all kinds
of various types of rebellion, I should say,

03:19:41.281 --> 03:19:44.731
against all the accepted truths

03:19:44.932 --> 03:19:49.829
or accepted goodness or value system.

03:19:50.158 --> 03:19:53.431
And I just thought that, of course,
in India

03:19:53.631 --> 03:19:56.365
the parents are rather strict, I must say
'right',

03:19:56.566 --> 03:19:58.966
but there's one more thing in India:

03:19:59.167 --> 03:20:02.543
there's a big outlet for them

03:20:02.745 --> 03:20:08.780
and I found that outlet was the talent
that they had.

03:20:08.981 --> 03:20:12.273
They had lots of talents, all of them,
I felt

03:20:12.474 --> 03:20:14.502
when I talked to them and this and that.

03:20:14.703 --> 03:20:20.373
I felt that they have lots of talent but
there is no way to express it.

03:20:20.574 --> 03:20:31.681
Certain people have been doing some sort
of an haphazard expression, I should say,

03:20:32.181 --> 03:20:38.749
and they could not understand themselves
why they were doing it.

03:20:38.950 --> 03:20:43.580
And this was the main thing that was
lacking, I think, in the West

03:20:43.781 --> 03:20:48.701
that the children had no way of expressing
themselves,

03:20:48.902 --> 03:20:51.376
of expressing their talent.

03:20:51.577 --> 03:20:55.430
And this talent was making them mad,
I think,

03:20:55.631 --> 03:21:01.978
that was making them absolutely rebellious.

03:21:02.179 --> 03:21:04.448
It was not their mistake by any chance,

03:21:04.649 --> 03:21:11.670
It was an energy within which was bubbling
and had no outlet.

03:21:13.233 --> 03:21:20.370
And whatever outlet they had was not
recognized, was not appreciated.

03:21:21.196 --> 03:21:26.044
And this made me feel that if these
children are given

03:21:26.245 --> 03:21:30.523
an outlet, a means of expressing
themselves,

03:21:30.724 --> 03:21:32.858
I am sure they’ll take to it.

03:21:33.083 --> 03:21:34.726
They'll forget all these things,

03:21:34.927 --> 03:21:41.106
they'll never take to all self-destructive
ideas

03:21:41.307 --> 03:21:44.689
because they were angry with them, I think.

03:21:44.890 --> 03:21:52.062
And it worked; it worked in the sense that
first I wanted

03:21:52.263 --> 03:21:58.183
Yogi (Mahajan) to start a school for small
children.

03:21:58.384 --> 03:22:02.616
And I was surprised how these children took

03:22:02.817 --> 03:22:06.778
to another kind of lifestyle, very
disciplined style

03:22:06.979 --> 03:22:12.861
and... they were very different children.

03:22:13.062 --> 03:22:19.201
Like in the West I found a child, supposing
you take him to the shop,

03:22:19.402 --> 03:22:23.987
he'll make you mad because he will say,
“Buy me this and buy me that and...”,

03:22:24.188 --> 03:22:28.665
not understanding that one cannot
afford it.

03:22:28.866 --> 03:22:37.006
And left to himself, I would say, that he
would go on buying the whole of the market.

03:22:37.207 --> 03:22:40.559
He was so mad about it.

03:22:40.783 --> 03:22:44.002
But I thought that there was some sort
of a thing

03:22:44.203 --> 03:22:47.936
that's lacking in him, in satisfaction.

03:22:48.143 --> 03:22:56.163
On the contrary, in India if you take one
boy or a girl to the market,

03:22:56.365 --> 03:22:58.425
they'll say, “Bas, bas - only one,

03:22:58.626 --> 03:23:01.795
one will do.” Big, very big problem.

03:23:01.996 --> 03:23:06.483
I had my own granddaughters, I took them
once to Delhi

03:23:06.684 --> 03:23:09.665
because they had broken their chappals
[slippers], you know,

03:23:09.866 --> 03:23:13.665
and they had only one pair. The parents
have else to do, no problem,

03:23:13.866 --> 03:23:17.614
but one chappal of that was broken, I said,
“All right, you come along.

03:23:17.815 --> 03:23:21.819
Now in Delhi you can get good ones,
we'll buy from them.”

03:23:22.021 --> 03:23:25.682
So they came and I bought for them.

03:23:25.884 --> 03:23:29.731
They said, “Nani, at any cost we'll not
take the second one.

03:23:29.932 --> 03:23:32.816
We'll just take one.”

03:23:33.017 --> 03:23:37.103
But I said, “Supposing this breaks. Then
what will happen?

03:23:37.304 --> 03:23:41.047
Then you will come back again to Delhi
to buy chappals?

03:23:41.248 --> 03:23:43.335
Have one spare at least.”

03:23:43.536 --> 03:23:48.494
They wouldn't listen and they ran away
into the car.

03:23:48.697 --> 03:23:52.757
I went there, I said, “What are you doing?
Why don't you buy chappals for yourselves?”

03:23:52.958 --> 03:23:55.994
“Why do you want to waste your money, Nani?

03:23:56.194 --> 03:24:00.181
You can use it for something else.”

03:24:00.383 --> 03:24:04.895
Now, I was surprised the way they were
so satisfied.

03:24:05.096 --> 03:24:07.061
Of course, they are born realized,
no doubt,

03:24:07.262 --> 03:24:11.115
but also the whole atmosphere.

03:24:11.513 --> 03:24:17.113
I felt that this atmosphere if the children
from the West can get,

03:24:17.314 --> 03:24:24.424
they will definitely prosper, they'll
definitely express themselves

03:24:24.625 --> 03:24:28.406
and they'll become excellent people.

03:24:28.607 --> 03:24:31.575
But I didn't know their energy was
so much, you see.

03:24:31.776 --> 03:24:38.502
After, my brother - your Babamama -
I asked him,

03:24:38.704 --> 03:24:41.714
“Why not start an Academy of music?”

03:24:41.876 --> 03:24:45.322
And when they came to music, I was
surprised.

03:24:45.523 --> 03:24:51.746
I was really surprised when we had not
expected anything from them,

03:24:51.947 --> 03:24:54.757
within three months, within four months,

03:24:54.958 --> 03:25:00.070
they picked up such a difficult music
style.

03:25:00.271 --> 03:25:06.764
It's impossible, it's impossible for
Indians to do that.

03:25:07.073 --> 03:25:10.161
They can never do [it] in four, four
months’ time.

03:25:10.362 --> 03:25:15.291
Oh baba, I've seen in my own family, there
were musicians

03:25:15.492 --> 03:25:20.731
and my sisters, my brothers, for hours
together...

03:25:20.932 --> 03:25:28.259
Every morning they used to get up at about
five o'clock and start their music.

03:25:29.221 --> 03:25:34.690
Every day rehearse for three, four hours,
every day.

03:25:34.891 --> 03:25:36.704
And I used to think, “Now, when will this
end?”

03:25:36.904 --> 03:25:41.913
I mean, after all, if somebody has to sleep
after 5:00, you can't, just can't sleep.

03:25:42.114 --> 03:25:46.557
But that's a custom in India to get up very
early in the morning.

03:25:46.758 --> 03:25:52.457
But the way these people are learning it
so fast, it is

03:25:52.658 --> 03:25:58.538
because that urge to express themselves
was inside very, very strong,

03:25:58.739 --> 03:26:03.490
much stronger than Indians. Just imagine!

03:26:03.691 --> 03:26:08.245
I can tell you very clearly, I have never
heard of anybody

03:26:08.446 --> 03:26:14.646
learning this difficult music in three
months and four months.

03:26:14.847 --> 03:26:18.557
For years together they would not learn.

03:26:18.758 --> 03:26:23.975
Same about you people: How you have
started appreciating it,

03:26:24.152 --> 03:26:27.252
I just don't know.

03:26:28.003 --> 03:26:32.671
I mean, it's a different atmosphere that
has started,

03:26:32.872 --> 03:26:38.504
so full of hope and joy.

03:26:38.706 --> 03:26:43.441
You see now, there was one fellow who
went to Belgium.

03:26:43.642 --> 03:26:48.510
He was an Italian, Italian Sahaja Yogi.

03:26:48.711 --> 03:26:50.652
He said, “Mother, I was surprised.

03:26:50.853 --> 03:26:54.119
There was a nice program with the Indians,

03:26:54.320 --> 03:26:58.781
and the Indian Consulate had arranged,
so I went to the program.

03:26:58.982 --> 03:27:03.106
And they were talking to each other and
some of them went out,

03:27:03.307 --> 03:27:06.809
some of them came in, these Indians.

03:27:07.010 --> 03:27:09.529
They never understood that it was Pilu rag,

03:27:09.729 --> 03:27:12.304
that one they couldn't recognize.

03:27:12.506 --> 03:27:16.491
Even an ordinary Pilu rag they cannot
recognize.”

03:27:16.693 --> 03:27:20.297
I was surprised that this Italian,
that he...

03:27:20.498 --> 03:27:24.094
What he's saying is really, I've seen it.

03:27:24.295 --> 03:27:32.580
The Indians when they go for this kind
of a very deep type of music,

03:27:32.781 --> 03:27:37.915
after 15 minutes they start slipping out.

03:27:39.401 --> 03:27:44.349
Also they told me that in England they went

03:27:44.550 --> 03:27:50.504
to a music centre or we can say for
the buying of the records or something.

03:27:50.705 --> 03:27:56.436
So, all the boys who were there, who were
Indians,

03:27:56.637 --> 03:28:01.561
were buying pop music, that music.

03:28:01.762 --> 03:28:05.466
And they looked at these Sahaja Yogis,
they said, “Are you stupid fools?

03:28:05.667 --> 03:28:10.655
Why are you buying this music, this Indian
music?

03:28:10.856 --> 03:28:12.961
What is there in this Indian music?”

03:28:13.162 --> 03:28:18.278
They said, “It's better not to talk to you
because you are gone cases.”

03:28:18.479 --> 03:28:22.386
Now, you see because, somehow or other,

03:28:22.587 --> 03:28:25.648
this is a Sahaj trick I think,

03:28:25.849 --> 03:28:27.941
that your energy's tuned up

03:28:28.142 --> 03:28:33.048
to a very subtle and deep understanding
of music.

03:28:33.249 --> 03:28:36.401
Otherwise, it would never have worked
like this.

03:28:36.602 --> 03:28:39.976
I mean, is the Kundalini, of course,
no doubt.

03:28:40.177 --> 03:28:47.533
But the way she has nourished you
to absorb, to understand, to enjoy.

03:28:47.734 --> 03:28:51.658
This is very subtle music.

03:28:52.508 --> 03:28:55.505
And it has happened more with the Western
people

03:28:55.705 --> 03:29:00.312
than with the Indians, I'm sorry to say.

03:29:00.513 --> 03:29:06.766
But Indians don't have that much of
understanding, nor that much of enjoyment.

03:29:06.967 --> 03:29:14.126
Westerners may not, may not understand
but they enjoy.

03:29:14.564 --> 03:29:21.142
Indians will, those who are, I mean,
a little bit educated in music,

03:29:21.343 --> 03:29:25.306
will start finding out faults,

03:29:25.507 --> 03:29:28.958
finding out ragas, “This was not good,
that...”.

03:29:29.159 --> 03:29:35.924
No, but not Westerners: Western people
are so humble about it.

03:29:36.125 --> 03:29:38.384
Isn't it remarkable?

03:29:38.585 --> 03:29:45.126
How is it they have picked up so quickly
and have understood?

03:29:45.328 --> 03:29:47.167
Because they have become subtler.

03:29:47.368 --> 03:29:50.872
This is the only thing I can say: they have
become subtler

03:29:51.073 --> 03:29:57.400
and their energies are flowing through
the subtler level.

03:29:58.218 --> 03:30:01.742
It's surprising for Babamama, also for me,
for everyone

03:30:01.950 --> 03:30:09.105
that in three, four months how can you
play Malkauns rag?

03:30:10.010 --> 03:30:15.943
First time I heard, I started wondering,
“How can that be?”

03:30:16.144 --> 03:30:24.239
And that gives such a hope to save this
music.

03:30:24.769 --> 03:30:29.033
It may be that in India it may be
declining,

03:30:29.234 --> 03:30:34.650
but in the West it's rising.

03:30:34.958 --> 03:30:41.137
Is the other way round: The Sun rises from
the East and sets on the West;

03:30:41.339 --> 03:30:46.694
here is the other way round now for music
and I would request all the Indians

03:30:46.895 --> 03:30:51.353
to develop that subtle understanding.

03:30:51.555 --> 03:31:02.929
You see, say if you are a honeybee, only
then you can suck in the honey.

03:31:04.698 --> 03:31:08.427
The flies cannot.

03:31:08.771 --> 03:31:12.177
So you have to develop that sensitivity.

03:31:12.378 --> 03:31:15.201
I would say to Indians, I'm sorry to say

03:31:15.402 --> 03:31:19.700
that you have to develop that sensitivity
within you,

03:31:19.901 --> 03:31:23.150
which is possible through meditation

03:31:23.351 --> 03:31:30.799
and through Kundalini awakening and
balancing

03:31:31.001 --> 03:31:37.770
and ultimately getting connected with this
all-pervading power of Chaitanya.

03:31:37.972 --> 03:31:41.733
Because Sound is the second stage.

03:31:41.935 --> 03:31:44.710
First was, of course, they said the Word.

03:31:44.911 --> 03:31:49.398
But it was silent, came into Sound

03:31:49.599 --> 03:31:57.124
and if you can understand the subtle
of the Sound within you,

03:31:58.107 --> 03:32:06.653
if you can get one with it, it gives you
that joy.

03:32:06.854 --> 03:32:13.616
But you will be surprised, I have never
studied music, never, all my life.

03:32:13.817 --> 03:32:21.821
Because, you see, I don't know why but
somehow I never studied

03:32:22.022 --> 03:32:26.718
because I could not have a guru, this is
the problem was.

03:32:28.830 --> 03:32:33.666
I couldn't have a guru, so somehow or
other, I never studied music.

03:32:33.867 --> 03:32:37.996
But what I have is the same as you have now

03:32:38.197 --> 03:32:46.341
is that subtle enjoyment sense of music.

03:32:46.542 --> 03:32:49.290
And that's why I say this is divine.

03:32:49.491 --> 03:32:51.821
Of course, I also enjoy some pop music,

03:32:52.022 --> 03:32:54.741
also enjoy western music very much

03:32:54.942 --> 03:32:58.813
and the Western great composers I enjoy,
no doubt.

03:32:59.014 --> 03:33:03.287
But this music has one speciality -

03:33:03.488 --> 03:33:11.760
that nothing is written down, there is
no composer.

03:33:11.961 --> 03:33:19.876
The musician is the composer, he is
the player and he is the book.

03:33:20.813 --> 03:33:24.124
It's so individualistic if you see that,

03:33:24.325 --> 03:33:27.141
but today I was happy to see all of them.

03:33:27.343 --> 03:33:32.922
This is the western side of it

03:33:33.123 --> 03:33:36.503
that so many of them put together were
singing, you see,

03:33:36.704 --> 03:33:41.219
like a choir but not so bad as that.

03:33:43.248 --> 03:33:48.930
And in the choir, you see, because I have
attended many choirs also,

03:33:49.131 --> 03:33:53.235
it was too systematic, too disciplined;

03:33:53.436 --> 03:33:58.169
this is not. Here it is complete freedom
within themselves.

03:33:58.370 --> 03:34:01.058
And the whole thing worked out so well,
I mean,

03:34:01.259 --> 03:34:04.940
it's such a good combination of both
the things:

03:34:05.141 --> 03:34:10.151
One side is the music, another side is
the collectivity.

03:34:10.389 --> 03:34:16.948
So I have never said a word about Baba's
University or Academy,

03:34:17.150 --> 03:34:21.946
but I told him that, “I'm very proud
of you.”

03:34:29.039 --> 03:34:35.222
He has very lovingly brought up this
Academy

03:34:35.432 --> 03:34:44.972
and has that character of our old guru
system which is very important.

03:34:45.173 --> 03:34:54.864
That keeps the whole place very holy,
as you call 'pavana'.

03:34:55.078 --> 03:34:57.398
And that is working out. He is working
very hard.

03:34:57.599 --> 03:34:59.802
I know Baba is working very hard,

03:35:00.003 --> 03:35:03.334
and all of you are working very hard
to help him.

03:35:03.535 --> 03:35:09.086
But this Academy will definitely, I'm sure,
one day will give

03:35:09.287 --> 03:35:15.680
that universal knowledge of that subtle
thing I am telling you about.

03:35:23.294 --> 03:35:31.466
I know it is late today and tonight, I
should say, but I am used to this more,

03:35:31.667 --> 03:35:35.871
because, you see, in our - when we were
young -

03:35:36.072 --> 03:35:39.951
my father was so fond of music and
musicians

03:35:40.152 --> 03:35:43.533
that so many times we have slept at about
five o'clock in the morning.

03:35:43.734 --> 03:35:46.054
So, [it] makes no difference to me.

03:35:46.255 --> 03:35:50.256
Same I find in you, people, that you are,
the way you are enjoying.

03:35:50.457 --> 03:35:53.951
So we have great hope of saving our young
people

03:35:54.152 --> 03:36:01.725
who are going astray, people who are
frustrated,

03:36:01.926 --> 03:36:09.012
people who are unhappy because they have
no satisfaction;

03:36:09.213 --> 03:36:16.554
people who are committing suicide
in the affluent countries.

03:36:16.755 --> 03:36:20.205
Also in our country people who are
becoming politicians,

03:36:20.406 --> 03:36:24.701
I think, that's the worst thing that can
happen to anyone.

03:36:25.549 --> 03:36:33.240
Also we have people who are doing all kinds
of criminal things,

03:36:33.454 --> 03:36:38.561
doing all kinds of violence and everything.

03:36:38.762 --> 03:36:47.402
All that can be completely covered with
the ocean of music.

03:36:47.951 --> 03:36:51.199
And if it is done by Sahaja Yogis,

03:36:51.400 --> 03:36:57.719
it would be such a great emancipation
for the whole world

03:36:57.920 --> 03:37:02.950
which is absolutely due and it is going
to work out.

03:37:03.151 --> 03:37:06.198
So I am thankful to Babamama

03:37:06.399 --> 03:37:10.988
and to all others who are supporting
him in this

03:37:11.189 --> 03:37:19.915
and I hope you all will enjoy this music
on a very subtle level.

03:37:20.116 --> 03:37:26.894
Because immediately with the mind which
reacts, one starts discussing,

03:37:27.095 --> 03:37:31.864
arguing, condemning also.

03:37:32.294 --> 03:37:38.345
That's not the way to understand this
music, but just to enjoy it.

03:37:38.547 --> 03:37:44.497
Enjoyment - it hasn't got two sides - is
only enjoyment, single,

03:37:44.698 --> 03:37:49.456
and that should happen to you, all of you.

03:37:49.657 --> 03:38:00.145
I am so much, so much overwhelmed really
by this beautiful renderings we have had.

03:38:00.346 --> 03:38:02.941
For example now we had from Aurangabad.

03:38:03.142 --> 03:38:06.108
I mean, I can't believe that in Aurangabad

03:38:06.309 --> 03:38:09.309
you could have such beautiful dancing.

03:38:09.511 --> 03:38:17.120
This Mr. Aurangzeb, after whom this name
is given - Aurangabad.

03:38:17.321 --> 03:38:19.882
[Marathi] -

03:38:20.083 --> 03:38:23.137
I don't know why it's called Aurangabad,
whatever it is.

03:38:23.338 --> 03:38:26.906
He was such a horribly fanatic man

03:38:27.107 --> 03:38:32.977
and every day he used to kill so many
Hindus.

03:38:33.178 --> 03:38:36.505
And when... Thank God he was a thin man.

03:38:36.706 --> 03:38:41.364
He was weaved in their thread, Janaeu
thread.

03:38:41.565 --> 03:38:45.629
How many were killed, you know. Imagine
what a cruel man he was,

03:38:45.830 --> 03:38:51.052
and under his name is this Aurangabad.
If you have to change any name

03:38:51.253 --> 03:38:55.545
in this country, it should be Aurangzeb
and Aurangabad.

03:38:57.932 --> 03:39:00.167
And he had no sense of music,

03:39:00.368 --> 03:39:03.427
he never used to listen to music, you know,

03:39:03.628 --> 03:39:08.660
but he was extremely honest; that's another
point about honesty.

03:39:08.861 --> 03:39:15.516
And he would not take any money for his
survival from the state.

03:39:15.717 --> 03:39:23.397
He used to stitch topis [hats] and sell
them. Can you imagine?

03:39:23.598 --> 03:39:26.452
If he had not done that and had been

03:39:26.653 --> 03:39:29.628
little bit loving person, would have been
much better.

03:39:29.829 --> 03:39:33.733
But from that Aurangabad comes this music
and dancing.

03:39:33.934 --> 03:39:38.285
I was amazed. I thought, “How can it be?”

03:39:38.486 --> 03:39:41.100
How did they call it Aurangabad, I don't
know,

03:39:41.301 --> 03:39:45.621
but he's the one who hated music.

03:39:47.047 --> 03:39:50.629
How could these people be born there?

03:39:50.830 --> 03:39:53.717
And what dancing they showed.

03:39:53.965 --> 03:39:56.014
Also you have seen the Kuchipudi

03:39:56.214 --> 03:40:02.340
from Baba’s Institute was another one –
I must – just eye-opener, I tell you.

03:40:02.548 --> 03:40:07.887
These are girls from, absolutely from
countries

03:40:08.088 --> 03:40:10.804
where they have never known all this.

03:40:11.005 --> 03:40:15.287
And in such a short time to learn such
a dance like Kuchipudi,

03:40:15.489 --> 03:40:19.939
is the most difficult dance, very fast.

03:40:20.140 --> 03:40:22.510
“My goodness!”, I thought that,

03:40:22.711 --> 03:40:25.895
“What has happened to them?”

03:40:26.316 --> 03:40:29.190
And you may say, “Mother, this is due
to Sahaj”,

03:40:29.391 --> 03:40:35.952
whatever it is, but Sahaj also is to be
borne by you people.

03:40:36.153 --> 03:40:42.541
Now if you have a very small little candle,
how much it can burn?

03:40:42.742 --> 03:40:49.080
But these are like the ocean of energies

03:40:49.281 --> 03:40:54.671
and the way they are expressing themselves
is remarkable.

03:40:54.872 --> 03:40:57.711
Of course, I love you very much

03:40:57.912 --> 03:41:02.191
and it is not out of that love and
admiration I am saying this,

03:41:02.392 --> 03:41:06.146
but it's a fact, is a reality.

03:41:06.905 --> 03:41:13.176
I, I had no idea that one day it will go
that well

03:41:14.200 --> 03:41:23.423
and this global movement is going to work
out wonders.

03:41:23.625 --> 03:41:28.953
You must spread also the music along
with the vibrations.

03:41:29.154 --> 03:41:32.155
I am sure it would be good.

03:41:32.356 --> 03:41:38.475
Really, for definite.
(Marathi)

03:41:39.786 --> 03:41:44.009
I - you can't believe, I asked Babamama,
“Who is, how is it?”

03:41:44.211 --> 03:41:49.497
He said, “Only four months’ time.”
Everybody four months.

03:41:51.445 --> 03:41:54.897
Very remarkable. Then we have one from
Spain.

03:41:55.098 --> 03:41:57.345
I saw him playing Spanish,

03:41:57.546 --> 03:42:00.774
but Spanish rhythm I don't understand much

03:42:00.975 --> 03:42:04.054
because it goes hectic, you know.

03:42:04.255 --> 03:42:09.812
It is very fast, sometimes very slow, but
it's very rhythmic, but is hectic.

03:42:10.013 --> 03:42:14.451
Ours is very much, I should say,
disciplined.

03:42:14.652 --> 03:42:18.815
Whatever it is, he also has played so well.

03:42:19.016 --> 03:42:23.038
So there are so many examples to show,

03:42:23.240 --> 03:42:27.321
that you may be from the Western country.

03:42:27.560 --> 03:42:33.609
It's better to be from the Western country
now for music than from this.

03:42:36.128 --> 03:42:39.860
I can't understand really, it's a, it's
a miracle,

03:42:40.061 --> 03:42:47.071
but why should this miracle work in the
West and not in India I don't understand.

03:42:47.272 --> 03:42:50.303
Though I am sure the Indians are enjoying
this music,

03:42:50.504 --> 03:42:52.802
no doubt, because they are all Sahaja
Yogis.

03:42:53.003 --> 03:42:55.859
But you go to any program -

03:42:56.060 --> 03:42:59.574
any other program where there are very
few Sahaja Yogis -

03:42:59.775 --> 03:43:05.439
you will see that the way they behave,
without any respect.

03:43:05.671 --> 03:43:09.872
The respect that is paid in India to
the musicians has to be

03:43:10.078 --> 03:43:16.202
of a very high level - or any talents -
say even art...

03:43:16.387 --> 03:43:22.129
See also people who make beautiful things
from their hands.

03:43:22.330 --> 03:43:28.204
All these people who are so talented, are
to be respected very much

03:43:28.405 --> 03:43:32.360
because it's a special gift God has given
them.

03:43:32.561 --> 03:43:36.485
Now in India, we have got a very big
problem also.

03:43:36.686 --> 03:43:47.824
All great artists got into the... I should
say, into the influence of the West,

03:43:48.025 --> 03:43:56.170
and so many of them take scotch whisky.
What do you say to that?

03:43:57.408 --> 03:44:03.767
So many; and their music is finished.

03:44:03.968 --> 03:44:06.511
You can't even play cricket with scotch
whisky,

03:44:06.711 --> 03:44:10.650
leave alone music.

03:44:10.850 --> 03:44:17.651
And this Western influence of taking drinks
and things like that

03:44:17.852 --> 03:44:22.027
has ruined our musicians and I don't know
what's going to happen.

03:44:22.228 --> 03:44:25.614
I was quite worried that how is it going
to be retained

03:44:25.815 --> 03:44:29.484
in this country, but now I have great hopes

03:44:29.685 --> 03:44:33.574
because if they see the Western people
doing so well...

03:44:33.775 --> 03:44:41.935
You see, for Indians, this goes into their
heads that, “How can they do it?”

03:44:42.136 --> 03:44:44.163
Oh, that goes very much...

03:44:44.364 --> 03:44:51.584
I mean if they see Western people doing
such good music,

03:44:51.785 --> 03:44:57.788
it's very influential. So, instead of
having any Indian artist

03:44:57.989 --> 03:45:01.962
on the stage, we should really bring
foreign.

03:45:02.164 --> 03:45:07.739
It will have a great effect, I tell you,
on Indians. (Marathi)

03:45:09.460 --> 03:45:12.497
It was very shameful the way sometimes
Indians behave

03:45:12.698 --> 03:45:19.160
in a classical music programs, very
shameful, for anybody.

03:45:19.361 --> 03:45:23.182
They have no sense, nothing and they go
on misbehaving.

03:45:23.384 --> 03:45:30.914
They come there for social, social affair,
I think, that's all.

03:45:31.501 --> 03:45:35.350
On this point, we Indians as Sahaja Yogis

03:45:35.551 --> 03:45:41.575
are to be responsible and to see for
yourself

03:45:41.776 --> 03:45:50.882
how much they have achieved, how much
they have understood.

03:45:51.643 --> 03:45:53.864
Somebody who saw them said,

03:45:54.066 --> 03:46:02.139
“Mother, now even in Indian music if they
go ahead of us, what will happen to us?”

03:46:03.868 --> 03:46:07.279
But still, we have very great musicians,

03:46:07.480 --> 03:46:11.401
as you have Arun Apte before you.

03:46:16.199 --> 03:46:21.517
I must tell you, we had a program in Puna,

03:46:21.718 --> 03:46:25.926
that's called as Shere, and I was very
tired.

03:46:26.127 --> 03:46:28.823
And so I told Yogi (Mahajan), “What is
in the program, next one?”

03:46:29.024 --> 03:46:35.718
He said, “Some musician has come. He wanted
to sing, so he has come.”

03:46:35.919 --> 03:46:38.812
I said, “Which musician?” “I don't know
his name...”

03:46:39.013 --> 03:46:40.934
But you see, Yogi (Mahajan), I think, was
that time

03:46:41.135 --> 03:46:46.525
not so much music-minded. Typical
Indian style.

03:46:46.726 --> 03:46:49.523
“So Mother, You go and sleep.”

03:46:49.725 --> 03:46:54.537
So I laid down and I heard his voice
and I heard his music.

03:46:54.738 --> 03:47:00.721
I said, “Who is this singing?” I came back,
I changed my sari,

03:47:00.923 --> 03:47:06.495
I asked Yogi, “Who is he?” They told me
the name.

03:47:06.696 --> 03:47:09.590
I said, “He's a great singer!

03:47:09.791 --> 03:47:13.844
What do you understand? How much are
you going to pay him?”

03:47:14.045 --> 03:47:19.967
He told me such a meagre thing, I said,
“Are you mad, Yogi?

03:47:21.597 --> 03:47:27.521
Then I went out and I heard his great
music.

03:47:27.730 --> 03:47:29.822
I've heard his guru also before

03:47:30.023 --> 03:47:32.565
who was also very great that time,

03:47:32.766 --> 03:47:37.461
and also Ajit Kadkade is his gurubandhu,
both of them are.

03:47:37.663 --> 03:47:42.947
But I was surprised that none of
the Indians could understand him,

03:47:43.148 --> 03:47:45.994
what he was singing.

03:47:46.534 --> 03:47:52.852
And this Maharashtra is known for music,
for classical music.

03:47:53.053 --> 03:47:59.140
But surprisingly, it's not that level now
that we had seen.

03:47:59.341 --> 03:48:07.689
I am happy to see this resurrection
of Indian music through you people.

03:48:07.890 --> 03:48:19.735
That was one of my greatest desire to get
the art, handicrafts and music -

03:48:19.936 --> 03:48:27.552
all kinds of things which are created
through this talent - should prosper.

03:48:27.753 --> 03:48:32.918
And I am very happy to see that despite
it's so late -

03:48:33.119 --> 03:48:36.812
I don't know what is the time, oh my God -

03:48:37.013 --> 03:48:41.506
you all are still alert and enjoying.

03:48:41.683 --> 03:48:49.742
I can't say about other artists who have
very much impressed you and impressed me.

03:48:49.943 --> 03:48:55.554
So this is a very good chance -
Ganapatipule - where we can have

03:48:55.755 --> 03:49:02.281
a very nice music, beautiful music,
so enjoyable.

03:49:02.482 --> 03:49:05.601
Thank you very much.
