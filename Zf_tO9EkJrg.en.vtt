00:02.090 --> 00:09.450
Today I am going to talk to you about attention.

00:09.450 --> 00:31.810
What is attention, what is the movement of
attention

00:31.810 --> 00:40.830
and what are the ways and methods of raising
our attention.

00:40.830 --> 00:44.690
Keep it in broad ways.

00:44.690 --> 00:47.219
Alright?

00:47.219 --> 00:48.890
But when I am saying all these things

00:48.890 --> 00:51.789
you must know that I am talking to you individually

00:51.789 --> 00:53.570
– it’s not about others.

00:53.570 --> 00:58.870
Always the first thing human beings do is,
when I am speaking to you,

00:58.870 --> 01:02.050
you try to find out about who Mataji is speaking!

01:02.050 --> 01:06.340
This is the best way of putting your attention
onto something else.

01:06.340 --> 01:12.999
If you put your attention to yourself that,
“This is for me and me and me alone,”

01:12.999 --> 01:17.590
then it will have an effect, because these
[words of mine] are mantras.

01:17.590 --> 01:20.009
And that’s why it is wasted

01:20.009 --> 01:25.069
because whatever is given to you is thrown
onto another person.

01:25.069 --> 01:34.509
So the attention, that you have, is the only
way to know the reality.

01:34.509 --> 01:39.859
Your own attention is important, not the attention
of others

01:39.859 --> 01:42.979
or your attention on others!

01:42.979 --> 01:44.670
This must be clearly understood.

01:44.670 --> 01:48.560
If you understand this point that the whole
thing

01:48.560 --> 01:50.090
is to be consumed by you,

01:50.090 --> 01:54.700
through your attention to raise yourself to
a higher situation,

01:54.700 --> 01:56.460
it will work out.

01:56.460 --> 01:58.459
Otherwise, it is like giving food to you

01:58.459 --> 02:00.209
and going to another person who is getting
nourished,

02:00.209 --> 02:02.209
while you are getting nothing.

02:02.209 --> 02:06.979
And that person also may not be able get nourished,

02:06.979 --> 02:09.709
because he doesn’t know that you are throwing
it to that person.

02:09.709 --> 02:14.590
So today, as I am going to speak to you about
attention,

02:14.590 --> 02:21.360
you should know that your attention should
absorb all that I am saying.

02:21.360 --> 02:24.750
It is not meant for anybody else.

02:24.750 --> 02:27.409
You better sit in thoughtless awareness, that’s
the best way,

02:27.409 --> 02:29.810
so that it goes into you.

02:29.810 --> 02:32.370
Otherwise it’s like a lecture, you know.

02:32.370 --> 02:34.640
That you listen to me has no effect.

02:34.640 --> 02:41.650
Every lecture will transform you because,
after all, I am speaking.

02:41.650 --> 02:45.390
But because you always think of others

02:45.390 --> 02:47.639
and you think of your problems all the time

02:47.639 --> 02:51.870
– something nonsensical is going on, about
which you are worried –

02:51.870 --> 02:53.840
and the attention is so overloaded

02:53.840 --> 02:56.819
that whatever is said to you doesn’t go
into you.

02:56.819 --> 03:01.390
So, just now, utilise it by being attentive
and knowing

03:01.390 --> 03:04.569
that all these nonsensical things have no
value.

03:04.569 --> 03:11.930
It’s your attention that has to come up
and has to grow.

03:11.930 --> 03:29.799
So, attention is the whole of the canvas of
your being

03:29.799 --> 03:34.040
– is a complete canvas, is the attention.

03:34.040 --> 03:38.430
Complete canvas of your being is the attention.

03:38.430 --> 03:42.139
How much you have gone into it, how much you
have discovered it,

03:42.139 --> 03:49.730
how far you have raised it is a different
point.

03:49.730 --> 03:54.900
Attention is Chitta and God is attention.

03:54.900 --> 04:01.739
How far your attention has been enlightened
is a different point.

04:01.739 --> 04:09.849
But your attention is God

04:09.849 --> 04:13.310
– if you become enlightened to that extent.

04:13.310 --> 04:18.910
It is like a canvas.

04:18.910 --> 04:24.340
You can say it is like a canvas which is spread
out for a film,

04:24.340 --> 04:33.949
and whatever aptitudes or, you can say, the
drags or movements, your attention has,

04:33.949 --> 04:36.569
shows on that canvas.

04:36.569 --> 04:43.720
I don’t know what is the word for ‘vritti’
in English language.

04:43.720 --> 04:51.659
It’s not aptitude, but a person gets prone
to, or his attention is dragged to

04:51.659 --> 04:55.410
– I don’t know [if] there is a word like
that in English language – vritti.

04:55.410 --> 05:01.880
Can you suggest any word?

05:01.880 --> 05:07.780
So our attention is just a pure, completely
pure canvas

05:07.780 --> 05:18.539
and is acted upon by the three gunas we have,
to begin with.

05:18.539 --> 05:21.210
And the three gunas come to you, as you know,

05:21.210 --> 05:26.710
one from your past, one from your future sense
and one from the present.

05:26.710 --> 05:40.379
Now, whatever have been your experiences about
a particular thing or a particular occasion,

05:40.379 --> 05:44.610
so far, is completely recorded in your memory.

05:44.610 --> 05:48.860
For example, if you see the black colour:

05:48.860 --> 05:56.840
all that goes with the black colour is recorded
in your memory.

05:56.840 --> 06:09.460
As soon as you see this black colour, quite
a lot of it comes up.

06:09.460 --> 06:16.110
That means, as soon as you see this with your
attention,

06:16.110 --> 06:21.020
the attention gets muddled up, or you can
say the attention gets coloured

06:21.020 --> 06:24.580
with all the memories about this black colour.

06:24.580 --> 06:36.120
And then your action takes place according
to the way your attention is affected.

06:36.120 --> 06:43.139
For example, just now something was burned
by these flames.

06:43.139 --> 06:48.599
Now, all of you became aware of it.

06:48.599 --> 06:53.370
Next time whenever you will see a flame,

06:53.370 --> 06:57.889
first thing [that] will happen will be that
you will be cautious about it.

06:57.889 --> 07:00.539
It is not going to happen again,

07:00.539 --> 07:03.860
but the whole memory will come to you

07:03.860 --> 07:07.740
and you will try to be cautious or warn others,

07:07.740 --> 07:14.509
because your attention will become aware of
that

07:14.509 --> 07:20.360
as soon as you will see that, because that
canvas of your attention

07:20.360 --> 07:26.760
itself will start throwing out these pictures,
out of itself,

07:26.760 --> 07:31.510
through your past experiences, on to the canvas.

07:31.510 --> 07:33.949
This is a living canvas.

07:33.949 --> 07:46.439
Or may be that
if you have got some ideas which you have

07:46.439 --> 07:47.439
premeditated,

07:47.439 --> 07:50.879
or thought of, of the future.

07:50.879 --> 07:55.400
For example, you must have thought of somebody
that,

07:55.400 --> 07:58.360
“If I meet that man I will tell him like
this.”

07:58.360 --> 08:01.560
As soon as you will meet that man,

08:01.560 --> 08:07.780
your attention will start bubbling out with
those ideas

08:07.780 --> 08:11.599
that are coming about this man, and you will
start addressing to him accordingly.

08:11.599 --> 08:13.659
It’s all stored up within you,

08:13.659 --> 08:17.080
whether it is about the future or about the
past.

08:17.080 --> 08:23.199
It’s given out of the attention through
that bubbling process

08:23.199 --> 08:30.539
which depends on your dragging nature, where
are you dragged.

08:30.539 --> 08:31.680
That’s called as vritti,

08:31.680 --> 08:34.130
but I don’t know what you call it in English
language.

08:34.130 --> 08:36.960
I do not know what is the, what you are prone
to (tendency).

08:36.960 --> 08:40.450
Vritti is a very neutral word.

08:40.450 --> 08:42.520
It doesn’t mean anything bad.

08:42.520 --> 08:45.110
It means where you are drawn to.

08:45.110 --> 08:48.730
Vritti means a temperament by which you are
drawn to.

08:48.730 --> 08:52.940
And whatever is your temperament, it acts
like that.

08:52.940 --> 09:00.110
For example, if you see a man walking, say,
blindly

09:00.110 --> 09:03.110
– he cannot see things –

09:03.110 --> 09:06.320
one person may get angry with that person,

09:06.320 --> 09:09.060
another may have pity for that person,

09:09.060 --> 09:12.440
third may come forward to help him out.

09:12.440 --> 09:14.990
It’s the vritti, it’s the temperament,

09:14.990 --> 09:19.600
that you have developed through your three
gunas.

09:19.600 --> 09:31.260
That’s why this attention becomes identified
with you.

09:31.260 --> 09:39.650
And when you are identified with this, your
vritti, your temperaments,

09:39.650 --> 09:45.380
then you are still in a misidentified area.

09:45.380 --> 09:51.780
Let us take a case of somebody who has been
possessed before.

09:51.780 --> 09:57.640
Now, coming to Sahaja Yoga his possession
goes away.

09:57.640 --> 10:03.170
But the memory remains in the brain that he
was possessed.

10:03.170 --> 10:09.330
And [if] the memory is stronger in a person,
left side is stronger,

10:09.330 --> 10:18.090
then that memory lingers on, and as soon as
that person comes in contact with anyone

10:18.090 --> 10:21.550
which has got something to do with the past
possession, it clicks.

10:21.550 --> 10:26.400
And the whole thing starts coming into you
bubbling out

10:26.400 --> 10:30.000
and you think you are again possessed.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.210
It is the memory which gives you [this reaction].

10:33.210 --> 10:34.560
It’s a myth.

10:34.560 --> 10:45.070
It’s the memory that tells you, “Oh, you
are again possessed!”

10:45.070 --> 10:47.150
Because your left side is weak, means you
always live in your memory.

10:47.150 --> 10:50.400
Your memory is stronger than yourself.

10:50.400 --> 10:54.670
If you could make yourself stronger than your
memory, nothing can possess you.

10:54.670 --> 11:05.550
But after you get your Realisation,

11:05.550 --> 11:12.930
you are not still identified with that state
of mind

11:12.930 --> 11:21.740
in which you see your ego and superego as
myths.

11:21.740 --> 11:29.620
Still you get caught up into your ego and
superego,

11:29.620 --> 11:33.860
and that’s why your attention is still in
a mess.

11:33.860 --> 11:42.600
In a pure simple way of attention in an innocent
child,

11:42.600 --> 11:47.860
he sees everything in pratyaksha,

11:47.860 --> 11:51.500
means in actual experiencing of something
– for a child –

11:51.500 --> 11:53.250
because he has no memory.

11:53.250 --> 11:59.560
So he’ll have to burn his hand to feel that
this burns.

11:59.560 --> 12:04.410
He has to touch something cold to know that
it is cold.

12:04.410 --> 12:08.520
His memory is not yet built up.

12:08.520 --> 12:16.980
So into the actual experiencing of it he lives.

12:16.980 --> 12:22.160
But that actual experiencing becomes memory.

12:22.160 --> 12:24.500
And once the memory is built up stronger,

12:24.500 --> 12:28.130
the whole personality is affected by memory.

12:28.130 --> 12:32.020
All the conditioning of all kinds come through
that;

12:32.020 --> 12:38.150
your reading, even the whole atmosphere can
come to you.

12:38.150 --> 12:42.530
You see, sometimes you smell a particular
soap,

12:42.530 --> 12:46.240
or say a rose, you smell it –

12:46.240 --> 12:51.140
then all the memories of smelling such a rose,
sometimes,

12:51.140 --> 12:53.270
comes to you and you may feel really elated
sometimes,

12:53.270 --> 12:55.880
maybe sometimes, maybe, or sometimes very
unhappy,

12:55.880 --> 12:59.190
whatever may be the situation.

12:59.190 --> 13:02.600
So you may feel happy or unhappy.

13:02.600 --> 13:07.830
Because, whatever experiences you have had,

13:07.830 --> 13:09.061
has given you a memory.

13:09.061 --> 13:13.780
This memory might have given you a superego,

13:13.780 --> 13:17.320
or might have given you a ego.

13:17.320 --> 13:21.060
This scanning might have taken place.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.850
If it has been a ego and a superego,

13:23.850 --> 13:27.010
then may be that, if it was ego you must have
felt happy.

13:27.010 --> 13:32.270
If it is satisfying to your ego you feel very
happy.

13:32.270 --> 13:37.640
If it is not, if it is superego, if you are
suppressed by this,

13:37.640 --> 13:39.630
then you feel very unhappy.

13:39.630 --> 13:42.370
So both things like happiness or unhappiness

13:42.370 --> 13:47.730
are the states where you are still in the
myth,

13:47.730 --> 13:51.120
still the myth exists.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.120
You have to still go beyond.

13:52.120 --> 13:55.720
So if you feel happy about some situation,
you should know you

13:55.720 --> 13:59.750
are only happy before Realisation,

13:59.750 --> 14:03.440
because it is giving some support to your
ego to bloat.

14:03.440 --> 14:10.990
And if you are unhappy, then you should know
that

14:10.990 --> 14:14.650
there is some sort of a suppression on your
ego

14:14.650 --> 14:17.180
and there’s a superego developing.

14:17.180 --> 14:24.060
So both the situations have been of no help
to you,

14:24.060 --> 14:29.230
of no help to you for your growth,

14:29.230 --> 14:32.740
except that both these institutions develop
so much

14:32.740 --> 14:42.040
that you are away from the real experiencing.

14:42.040 --> 14:44.940
The real experiencing stops

14:44.940 --> 14:51.050
because your attention is so much muddled
up.

14:51.050 --> 14:56.670
So on one side if you move – on the left
hand side –

14:56.670 --> 15:05.730
your attention is muddled up with fear, with
pain,

15:05.730 --> 15:14.800
with unhappiness, with hopelessness, dejection.

15:14.800 --> 15:20.029
The other side, if you indulge too much on
to the right hand side

15:20.029 --> 15:22.650
– little bit also –

15:22.650 --> 15:28.260
you start getting elated, excited, over-dominating.

15:28.260 --> 15:39.070
The colour of the left side is blue.

15:39.070 --> 15:42.280
And the blue colour starts changing to the
black.

15:42.280 --> 15:49.200
While on the right hand side it is, to begin
with, yellow,

15:49.200 --> 15:53.710
light yellow or you can say golden,

15:53.710 --> 15:57.970
then yellow, then orange and then red.

15:57.970 --> 16:01.380
So you go to aggression on the right hand
side.

16:01.380 --> 16:09.010
On the left hand side you go into a complete
state of

16:09.010 --> 16:12.510
entropy, you can call it,

16:12.510 --> 16:16.040
or a state where you are separated from yourself

16:16.040 --> 16:17.940
into a complete frozen state.

16:17.940 --> 16:21.390
So [on] one side you become completely frozen,

16:21.390 --> 16:25.050
on the other side you become completely heated
up.

16:25.050 --> 16:32.480
Both these things are, again, movement on
the wrong direction.

16:32.480 --> 16:37.790
Even in the centre when the attention is kept

16:37.790 --> 16:41.410
– that you keep your attention more in the
centre –

16:41.410 --> 16:44.800
there also, because it’s a very sensitive
point,

16:44.800 --> 16:46.860
it doesn’t stay there.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.020
For example,

16:48.020 --> 16:55.560
when we, say, use fire, we can use it for
burning the house.

16:55.560 --> 17:03.710
In the same way we can use it for creating
smoke.

17:03.710 --> 17:10.399
But we can also use this fire in its proper
way, if we use it,

17:10.399 --> 17:15.079
in its proper proportion, for cooking the
food [or] for giving us light.

17:15.079 --> 17:22.329
If it is too much, it can burn like a big
fire.

17:22.329 --> 17:24.980
If it is too little, it can burn like smoke.

17:24.980 --> 17:29.639
But in the center when you know how to balance
it,

17:29.639 --> 17:31.789
then you can use it for your own purpose

17:31.789 --> 17:40.149
– for cooking or for giving light, and then
for a puja too.

17:40.149 --> 17:49.429
So in the same way when we really balance
our gunas properly,

17:49.429 --> 17:59.090
then we become gradually the master of the
whole situation.

17:59.090 --> 18:05.330
The attention doesn’t get dragged

18:05.330 --> 18:06.730
into things that we have been doing

18:06.730 --> 18:10.490
or that we have understood through our memories

18:10.490 --> 18:13.650
or through our experiences or whatever it
is,

18:13.650 --> 18:17.000
and is not also dragged towards, too much,
on the right hand side

18:17.000 --> 18:21.429
that we try to overpower, or try to dominate
someone.

18:21.429 --> 18:25.049
Because if you move too much that side you
have seen [that]

18:25.049 --> 18:26.090
it becomes blood.

18:26.090 --> 18:30.210
It is difficult for people to understand how,

18:30.210 --> 18:35.269
when people become very religious-minded,
like now Iran,

18:35.269 --> 18:39.030
the movement is on the right

18:39.030 --> 18:42.970
– all the austerities, all that, everything
– now bloodshed.

18:42.970 --> 18:47.149
Christians also did the same.

18:47.149 --> 18:49.650
Brahmins did the same in India.

18:49.650 --> 18:55.100
Buddhists did the same, even [though] they
talked of nonviolence

18:55.100 --> 19:01.610
they got to bloodshed, because movement started
[on the] right hand side.

19:01.610 --> 19:07.690
Left hand side movement will take you to very
sly and dark methods.

19:07.690 --> 19:12.769
So right-handed sided people – like big
nations

19:12.769 --> 19:16.169
who are supposed to be developed nations –

19:16.169 --> 19:17.750
they justify war.

19:17.750 --> 19:22.940
“We must have weapons to face each other.”

19:22.940 --> 19:27.669
But you all, each other, are the same people
from God’s point of view!

19:27.669 --> 19:30.049
Why are you fighting?

19:30.049 --> 19:32.710
When God asks you, “Why are you fighting,
what is the need?

19:32.710 --> 19:35.960
Why don’t you sit down properly and listen
to each other?

19:35.960 --> 19:37.740
What are you fighting about?

19:37.740 --> 19:38.880
You are fighting about land.

19:38.880 --> 19:40.559
Is it your father’s land?

19:40.559 --> 19:42.059
It belongs to God!

19:42.059 --> 19:43.940
God has created this land.

19:43.940 --> 19:46.210
Why are you fighting?”

19:46.210 --> 19:49.169
But your attention is such that immediately
you think,

19:49.169 --> 19:50.899
“Oh, this is my land, this is my motherland,

19:50.899 --> 19:53.690
this is my fatherland, this is my brotherland.”

19:53.690 --> 19:56.420
But what about your land which is within you?

19:56.420 --> 19:58.100
It’s not your own!

19:58.100 --> 20:04.879
So if you go on telling these people that
we should have no war they will not listen.

20:04.879 --> 20:06.740
Realisation is the only way.

20:06.740 --> 20:10.879
By Realisation your attention gets higher

20:10.879 --> 20:15.289
and gets separated from that strata from where
these things bubble in.

20:15.289 --> 20:18.710
Do you understand my point now?

20:18.710 --> 20:20.360
The strata goes higher,

20:20.360 --> 20:25.730
the attention goes higher, at a higher state.

20:25.730 --> 20:32.950
By right side movement you get vikshepa, confusion.

20:32.950 --> 20:35.399
First you get confusion.

20:35.399 --> 20:38.860
Every intellectual, whatever brilliant he
may be, he is confused.

20:38.860 --> 20:42.440
And the more confused he is, the more he asserts
himself

20:42.440 --> 20:46.250
because he is confused, he’s not sure of
himself, so he asserts,

20:46.250 --> 20:48.799
“This is the thing; this is the thing.”

20:48.799 --> 20:51.030
I mean, if it is so, why should you assert
it?

20:51.030 --> 20:54.360
But he goes on asserting, “This is the thing!”

20:54.360 --> 20:57.139
Then understand that now he is going towards
lunatic asylum – absolutely!

20:57.139 --> 21:02.330
And the way he asserts, and goes on talking
about it,

21:02.330 --> 21:08.090
all the time, that means he is not sure.

21:08.090 --> 21:11.780
He becomes like a possessed personality.

21:11.780 --> 21:18.740
When he explains everything through his brains
that

21:18.740 --> 21:19.870
“This is the thing.

21:19.870 --> 21:20.870
This is correct.

21:20.870 --> 21:21.870
We must all do, this is what…”

21:21.870 --> 21:24.690
and he convinces many others who are confused
like him.

21:24.690 --> 21:25.920
They depend on him.

21:25.920 --> 21:27.659
He becomes a leader because, you see,

21:27.659 --> 21:29.779
they are much more confused

21:29.779 --> 21:32.730
and they find somebody who is not so much
confused outwardly

21:32.730 --> 21:35.679
[so] they stick on to him, and all of them
get to war

21:35.679 --> 21:41.840
or some sort of a bloodshed or some sort of
– they want to see blood.

21:41.840 --> 21:47.049
They become heartless, passionless, compassionless,

21:47.049 --> 21:53.480
you can say – compassionless, loveless people.

21:53.480 --> 21:57.480
The other movement is the blue side, is like
the blue moonlight.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.659
So, for the romanticism starts.

22:00.659 --> 22:02.789
Sitting in the moonlight, you see!

22:02.789 --> 22:09.750
The ideas start coming from Lord Byron (laughter).

22:09.750 --> 22:15.740
And they come into your attention

22:15.740 --> 22:18.561
– then it becomes very strong passion with
you.

22:18.561 --> 22:23.390
You think, “Oh, I am still, I have to find
out my loves!”

22:23.390 --> 22:28.629
And you go on in search of your loves and
this and that.

22:28.629 --> 22:32.160
These things are not really giving joy.

22:32.160 --> 22:38.169
That’s why so many poems have been written
that,

22:38.169 --> 22:43.980
“Love is the most painful thing, it’s
worse than death,”

22:43.980 --> 22:47.090
and all sorts of poems are written like that

22:47.090 --> 22:49.220
so why did you get into it?

22:49.220 --> 22:52.450
I mean, it’s already written down, books
after books,

22:52.450 --> 22:56.379
still why do you get into it? (laughing)

22:56.379 --> 22:59.940
You are already warned about it that,

22:59.940 --> 23:03.559
“Don’t go after love, love is deception,
love is this, that,

23:03.559 --> 23:08.039
it is very temporary, it is for the little
while you get that.”

23:08.039 --> 23:11.950
By chance, if somebody could stop at a point

23:11.950 --> 23:16.649
by marrying somebody who is sweet enough and
realise

23:16.649 --> 23:21.700
that love and marriage and all these things
are in the centre,

23:21.700 --> 23:25.169
are like the fire in the kitchen,

23:25.169 --> 23:27.740
are like the fire in the temple:

23:27.740 --> 23:34.860
looks after it and doesn’t overdo something
about it.

23:34.860 --> 23:39.499
Then maybe that this may be utilized.

23:39.499 --> 23:45.480
In the same way the right side movement of
the Sun line.

23:45.480 --> 23:49.190
If people think that, yes, the sun is important,

23:49.190 --> 23:52.360
we have to have sun in the house,

23:52.360 --> 23:57.649
but you are not to become naked and insult
the Sun and get your skin cancer!

23:57.649 --> 24:02.649
Sun is not for your skin cancer!

24:02.649 --> 24:07.529
But if you overdo it, also it is dangerous.

24:07.529 --> 24:13.970
A person who exposes himself too much to planning

24:13.970 --> 24:16.730
and doing that, and doing this, and doing
all this,

24:16.730 --> 24:20.440
can land up into very great difficulties.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.869
So you have to balance that side also

24:22.869 --> 24:28.179
and this side and you have to be in the centre,
in the equilibrium.

24:28.179 --> 24:33.049
Now this word ‘equilibrium’ doesn’t
exist in our day-to-day life.

24:33.049 --> 24:35.320
It exists only in the fiction

24:35.320 --> 24:40.390
or may be in the so-called scientific research.

24:40.390 --> 24:42.460
But as far as human beings are concerned,

24:42.460 --> 24:46.259
they do not know what is equilibrium is.

24:46.259 --> 24:50.190
Because of this, the attention, though after
Realisation

24:50.190 --> 24:54.990
comes up, still on the sides they just go
down,

24:54.990 --> 24:58.970
this side or that side according to your vrittis.

24:58.970 --> 25:02.830
And when these identifications still act in
them,

25:02.830 --> 25:07.659
they are prone to go down again in their attention

25:07.659 --> 25:16.960
and again start bubbling out the same thing
as they had.

25:16.960 --> 25:23.899
Now one has to become lighter in one’s own
mind

25:23.899 --> 25:26.010
and should think that,

25:26.010 --> 25:30.059
“We have dropped all that now why are we
there?”

25:30.059 --> 25:35.110
One should become lighter with all that load
flowing out,

25:35.110 --> 25:43.120
because you are here to raise your attention
higher and higher

25:43.120 --> 25:46.470
so that you come up to a point

25:46.470 --> 25:50.259
where you become one with the attention of
God.

25:50.259 --> 25:57.179
Already your attention is sparkled because
through your attention

25:57.179 --> 25:58.200
you can see what’s wrong with you,

25:58.200 --> 26:01.539
you can see what’s wrong with others

26:01.539 --> 26:05.980
and you can see how far you are going with
yourself.

26:05.980 --> 26:11.659
But the progress is retarded because you do
not know that this attention

26:11.659 --> 26:15.659
is pure form and all that you get into this
attention

26:15.659 --> 26:24.450
is a mythical stuff, is a myth.

26:24.450 --> 26:30.840
If you drop this myth gradually, treat everything
as a myth

26:30.840 --> 26:33.600
and not depend on becoming unhappy or happy

26:33.600 --> 26:36.621
– just seeing the thing –

26:36.621 --> 26:37.950
[then] your attention will take a flight

26:37.950 --> 26:42.700
and it will be at a much higher level residing
there.

26:42.700 --> 26:48.519
Instead of that, every moment you go this
way or that way

26:48.519 --> 26:50.210
– it goes on like that –

26:50.210 --> 26:52.940
and the movement upwards is much less.

26:52.940 --> 26:56.309
Even in Sattvoguna, when you rise,

26:56.309 --> 27:00.669
you can go much worse in that condition also.

27:00.669 --> 27:04.750
For example, if you say that, “I am trying
to be Sattwoguni.”

27:04.750 --> 27:14.610
In Sattwoguni it is that you start seeing
everything,

27:14.610 --> 27:17.039
discriminating through your understanding

27:17.039 --> 27:19.929
– not through vibrations – through understanding:

27:19.929 --> 27:20.929
“Oh!

27:20.929 --> 27:27.409
Should we not somehow or the other take out
our attention from here?”

27:27.409 --> 27:30.679
“Should we not give up this?”

27:30.679 --> 27:32.320
“Should we be charitable?”

27:32.320 --> 27:36.130
“Should we go and serve the people?”

27:36.130 --> 27:37.900
There are people who think,

27:37.900 --> 27:40.559
“Oh, we are going to do something great!”

27:40.559 --> 27:43.490
– like your Salvation Army.

27:43.490 --> 27:44.989
Let them be salvaged by themselves!

27:44.989 --> 27:48.340
I don’t know what salvation they are going
to do.

27:48.340 --> 27:52.080
So these ideas – ideas, I am saying – of
Sattvoguna,

27:52.080 --> 27:57.999
can also immobilise you and can really freeze
you down once for all,

27:57.999 --> 28:02.350
and that also can work in you in such a sly
manner,

28:02.350 --> 28:07.260
we can say, in such a secretive manner,

28:07.260 --> 28:08.610
that you won’t feel it.

28:08.610 --> 28:11.590
All these ideas of helping others, being charitable,

28:11.590 --> 28:13.429
“Let’s have a charity association!”

28:13.429 --> 28:14.429
– finished!

28:14.429 --> 28:16.789
Once you work in a charity association,

28:16.789 --> 28:18.879
your attention is finished there.

28:18.879 --> 28:23.399
But if your attention goes higher

28:23.399 --> 28:25.440
– say [as] my attention is.

28:25.440 --> 28:26.509
I am only nothing but charity!

28:26.509 --> 28:29.049
I mean what am I?

28:29.049 --> 28:31.899
It just flows.

28:31.899 --> 28:36.049
You just become the charity.

28:36.049 --> 28:39.330
So the difference between

28:39.330 --> 28:43.269
a person who is a realised and a not realised
is this

28:43.269 --> 28:51.679
that the attention which was giving myth as
reality to you

28:51.679 --> 28:53.789
is gone now, is gone higher.

28:53.789 --> 28:57.529
It can see that it is myth.

28:57.529 --> 29:00.909
Attention can clearly see that it is myth,

29:00.909 --> 29:03.659
and you can see that yourself

29:03.659 --> 29:08.100
and you can remove yourself from them.

29:08.100 --> 29:12.850
That, of course, I have to give you a push,
no doubt,

29:12.850 --> 29:15.450
and I am working hard on that to give you
a push.

29:15.450 --> 29:18.749
But you should also know that mythical things
must be dropped out,

29:18.749 --> 29:22.039
otherwise you will not grow.

29:22.039 --> 29:26.700
All mythical things must be dropped out.

29:26.700 --> 29:30.169
And the best way to do it is to be in thoughtless
awareness

29:30.169 --> 29:32.880
because as soon as you transcend these three
gunas

29:32.880 --> 29:34.639
you become thoughtlessly aware.

29:34.639 --> 29:36.029
You have to cross Agya.

29:36.029 --> 29:39.090
Once you cross Agya, these three gunas,

29:39.090 --> 29:42.919
absolutely you go into a state where you are
gunateet,

29:42.919 --> 29:44.659
you are beyond gunas.

29:44.659 --> 29:51.940
So you do not deliberately do anything,

29:51.940 --> 29:57.169
but it just works out.

29:57.169 --> 30:01.259
But analysis is one of the diseases of the
West.

30:01.259 --> 30:03.149
What are you analysing?

30:03.149 --> 30:04.149
What are you analysing?

30:04.149 --> 30:05.269
You ask yourself.

30:05.269 --> 30:08.620
I feel like laughing at the whole analysis
that goes on.

30:08.620 --> 30:13.809
See, they’ll sit down, take out a hair,
splitting the hair into hundred!

30:13.809 --> 30:17.700
And great analysers are sitting down there!

30:17.700 --> 30:22.210
They cannot even say how the chromosomes

30:22.210 --> 30:23.289
have that spindle action

30:23.289 --> 30:29.320
and, I mean at that minute level the things
are worked out.

30:29.320 --> 30:34.450
They cannot say how a cell divides.

30:34.450 --> 30:41.080
What are they analysing sitting down here?

30:41.080 --> 30:47.970
Now, they have analysed for a purpose – also
done for God.

30:47.970 --> 30:52.669
Through their analysis now my things are recorded.

30:52.669 --> 30:55.129
Through their analysis I can go to the TV,

30:55.129 --> 30:58.380
if they allow me any time, because of analysis
[it] doesn’t fit into me,

30:58.380 --> 31:05.350
they won’t allow, they may not, it might
be expedited.

31:05.350 --> 31:07.149
But say, for example, if you had not discovered
these things –

31:07.149 --> 31:09.460
for example take it like that –

31:09.460 --> 31:12.720
and the science was not discovered,

31:12.720 --> 31:20.889
your attention would have been at least better
off.

31:20.889 --> 31:24.659
Because of science, your attention is also
very much in confusion.

31:24.659 --> 31:33.359
So I don’t know which one to praise, whether
the science or the primitiveness.

31:33.359 --> 31:37.210
When you raised yourself to science also,

31:37.210 --> 31:38.580
you got to another extreme as usual.

31:38.580 --> 31:44.129
Till you burnt out your complete attention,
you were not satisfied.

31:44.129 --> 31:46.481
I mean if you had kept your balance in science
also

31:46.481 --> 31:47.481
it would have helped, but the balance was
lost there.

31:47.481 --> 31:56.360
Give anything to human beings and they know
how to make the worst out of it.

31:56.360 --> 31:57.490
They will go to the extreme.

31:57.490 --> 31:59.440
You give them a horse,

31:59.440 --> 32:02.190
they cannot go ordinary trotting or galloping,

32:02.190 --> 32:06.239
they must have a double gallop, till they
fall and die!

32:06.239 --> 32:12.210
Everything you see, they just are on the run
all the time.

32:12.210 --> 32:14.950
So first thing is needed is to steady down
yourself

32:14.950 --> 32:18.090
and tell yourself that, “Now all these mythical
things

32:18.090 --> 32:20.139
I am not going to allow to come to my attention.”

32:20.139 --> 32:26.389
All these things are nothing but myths.

32:26.389 --> 32:30.730
But you are giving too much importance to
myths.

32:30.730 --> 32:33.110
You are taking them bit so seriously.

32:33.110 --> 32:34.270
They are just mythical.

32:34.270 --> 32:38.299
Now, I mean, when you are realised now you
laugh at people

32:38.299 --> 32:42.470
who just go mad over say, a moonlit night.

32:42.470 --> 32:43.470
Alright?

32:43.470 --> 32:48.419
But ask the fellow who is doing that,

32:48.419 --> 32:54.513
he’ll say, “You are heartless, you have
no feelings!” (laughter)

32:54.513 --> 32:57.830
He’ll give you a big poetry out of it.

32:57.830 --> 33:00.989
You go and see anyone of these people who
are riding a high horse,

33:00.989 --> 33:02.590
who are at the helm of affairs,

33:02.590 --> 33:06.259
and you will feel like laughing at them.

33:06.259 --> 33:10.190
But they will think that, “You are useless,
you are doing no work,

33:10.190 --> 33:13.450
you are good for nothing, you are just wasters.”

33:13.450 --> 33:20.970
So now for you, because you are enlightened
now, is to understand

33:20.970 --> 33:29.100
that our attention has to move higher and
higher, at a higher space.

33:29.100 --> 33:32.730
Now actually what has happened in Realisation?

33:32.730 --> 33:37.879
Your Kundalini has risen and has come up,

33:37.879 --> 33:48.019
just like, you can say, a small, thin hair,
one hair,

33:48.019 --> 33:54.549
and that has broken your Sahastrara

33:54.549 --> 33:58.039
and now the grace is flowing into you.

33:58.039 --> 34:02.549
But it’s a very small movement that has
taken place, of course

34:02.549 --> 34:09.090
which is a very difficult movement no doubt,
but it has taken place.

34:09.090 --> 34:14.570
Now you have not expanded like this.

34:14.570 --> 34:17.250
Your chakras are only pierced in the centre,

34:17.250 --> 34:21.100
but the rest of the attention is still intact.

34:21.100 --> 34:26.510
Actually it is so intact, that you don’t
even feel that it is pierced.

34:26.510 --> 34:33.670
Now you have to expand that, open it out,

34:33.670 --> 34:42.700
so that more strands of Kundalini can rise
and your attention,

34:42.700 --> 34:49.320
which is in these centers, expands.

34:49.320 --> 34:54.000
By expansion it drives out all that is mythical
on the sides.

34:54.000 --> 34:59.880
On every centre we have our attention,

34:59.880 --> 35:02.880
which is being enlightened in the centre

35:02.880 --> 35:04.640
through this Light passing through.

35:04.640 --> 35:12.940
But the Light is too small for the darkness
that you have collected.

35:12.940 --> 35:16.650
Specially for the people of the West, I would
say,

35:16.650 --> 35:21.160
your confusions, you must get rid of them.

35:21.160 --> 35:23.070
But still you identify.

35:23.070 --> 35:26.590
Because if I ask you anything [like], “How
are you?”

35:26.590 --> 35:30.500
Means what?

35:30.500 --> 35:37.930
Means you are still confused.

35:37.930 --> 35:39.690
Alright?

35:39.690 --> 35:42.590
Confusion should go.

35:42.590 --> 35:44.930
One confusion was there that,

35:44.930 --> 35:47.270
“This is Realisation or not?”

35:47.270 --> 35:51.190
I hope that’s over now with you people.

35:51.190 --> 35:54.060
At least now you believe it is Self-realisation.

35:54.060 --> 35:56.280
I had to tell people, “No, you are self-realised
now, you are!”

35:56.280 --> 35:58.860
Still they would jump up like [a] jack-in-the-box,
you see.

35:58.860 --> 36:01.440
They’ll say, “No, we’re not Mother!

36:01.440 --> 36:02.950
How do you say this is Realisation?”

36:02.950 --> 36:08.130
“We expect this out of Realisation and that
out of Realisation

36:08.130 --> 36:10.940
– that we’ll be flying out of the door
if we are Realised,”

36:10.940 --> 36:12.870
or something nonsensical like that.

36:12.870 --> 36:15.350
Thank God, these ideas have gone away.

36:15.350 --> 36:20.970
But when we are Realised, there is Light that
has come in us,

36:20.970 --> 36:25.290
we have to grow it only by separating our
attention

36:25.290 --> 36:27.240
from the myths.

36:27.240 --> 36:32.010
It’s all mythical.

36:32.010 --> 36:33.840
I also play with you,

36:33.840 --> 36:39.550
because unless and until you are sure,

36:39.550 --> 36:47.840
I am not going to give you a wrong idea about
yourself.

36:47.840 --> 36:52.360
I want to see how far still your attention
is moving,

36:52.360 --> 36:56.910
and I know [that] still you are not sure,

36:56.910 --> 37:02.030
still you are not sure of yourself,

37:02.030 --> 37:09.170
that’s why the confidence is not there.

37:09.170 --> 37:16.940
First of all you have to learn how to drive,
then you are tested.

37:16.940 --> 37:21.160
There will be five stones put together,

37:21.160 --> 37:25.510
the distance will be only that hardly a car
can pass through

37:25.510 --> 37:28.810
and the fellow will say, “You bring it zigzag!”

37:28.810 --> 37:32.440
And you cannot do it.

37:32.440 --> 37:33.500
Why?

37:33.500 --> 37:39.960
That’s how he makes you a master.

37:39.960 --> 37:42.210
The mastery of your attention

37:42.210 --> 37:48.950
will come when you will start seeing that
it is all a myth that upsets you.

37:48.950 --> 37:52.830
It’s all a myth that upsets you.

37:52.830 --> 37:57.990
Just throw it away.

37:57.990 --> 38:02.340
Just throw it away and understand that you
are

38:02.340 --> 38:10.960
the eternal attention, that you are the eternal
life,

38:10.960 --> 38:19.730
that [the] only thing that keeps you away
from it is ignorance,

38:19.730 --> 38:24.150
and the ignorance is too simple to understand:

38:24.150 --> 38:29.650
that you have accepted myth as Truth.

38:29.650 --> 38:30.760
Just drop it!

38:30.760 --> 38:33.050
It’s all myth!

38:33.050 --> 38:40.360
You’ll be amazed how your attention will
rise

38:40.360 --> 38:44.520
and you’ll see all these nonsensical things

38:44.520 --> 38:48.350
which used to frighten you or to elate you,

38:48.350 --> 38:52.790
will drop out, and you will just smile at
it.

38:52.790 --> 38:57.730
And then only you are going to enjoy yourself
fully

38:57.730 --> 39:01.630
because your attention will be completely
drenched

39:01.630 --> 39:05.060
into the bliss of Self.

39:05.060 --> 39:14.110
I am saying you will, I say you are

39:14.110 --> 39:16.780
already drenched into that bliss.

39:16.780 --> 39:18.850
Keep it up.

39:18.850 --> 39:25.390
Now, how to do it?

39:25.390 --> 39:37.630
Actually, in every day-to-day life, how to
kill the memory of the past?

39:37.630 --> 39:45.050
To kill the memory of the past is to have
new memories.

39:45.050 --> 39:49.590
You must remember when you got your first
Realisation

39:49.590 --> 39:52.780
– always think of it.

39:52.780 --> 39:55.141
Whenever any such memory comes to you,

39:55.141 --> 40:01.530
you [should] try to think how you got your
Realisation.

40:01.530 --> 40:06.920
Any memory that is troublesome or even so-called
elating,

40:06.920 --> 40:15.510
you just try to remember how Realisation has
come to you.

40:15.510 --> 40:22.800
When you feel aggressive about something or
angry [about] something,

40:22.800 --> 40:31.080
just try to remember how you felt the joy
of surrendering.

40:31.080 --> 40:36.070
Just think of that joy of surrendering, of
dissolving yourself.

40:36.070 --> 40:41.090
So the new memories must be built up.

40:41.090 --> 40:43.860
If you start building up new memories,

40:43.860 --> 40:49.180
then you will start collecting moments

40:49.180 --> 40:57.990
to establish other moments which have such
memories.

40:57.990 --> 41:04.060
Like a memory when you tried to help somebody,

41:04.060 --> 41:06.380
you raised the Kundalini of someone.

41:06.380 --> 41:09.800
Now the problem would be

41:09.800 --> 41:11.830
when you will be raising the Kundalini of
others,

41:11.830 --> 41:14.220
you will be in thoughtless awareness – there
won’t be any thought –

41:14.220 --> 41:19.030
and thought is the only thing which impresses.

41:19.030 --> 41:24.950
But [at] that time you can record the joy
of raising the Kundalini.

41:24.950 --> 41:31.910
If you could record the joy of raising the
Kundalini

41:31.910 --> 41:42.650
of others, you will feel [that] a new wealth

41:42.650 --> 41:47.350
of these beautiful moments will be accumulated.

41:47.350 --> 41:54.440
And all those moments which were giving you
confusion

41:54.440 --> 42:00.540
or fear or so-called unhappiness and happiness
will drop out

42:00.540 --> 42:03.610
and pure joy will remain.

42:03.610 --> 42:07.260
Because now most of the experiences you have
had

42:07.260 --> 42:11.180
are more of joy.

42:11.180 --> 42:13.420
Joy has no thoughts.

42:13.420 --> 42:18.800
It’s just an experience, a pratyaksha.

42:18.800 --> 44:50.550
That’s why I said you keep your eyes open.

44:50.550 --> 47:40.840
I hope

47:40.840 --> 49:21.520
you will understand what

49:21.520 --> 49:39.900
I mean

49:39.900 --> 56:22.660
by that.

56:22.660 --> 57:03.760
May

57:03.760 --> 01:15:01.639
God bless you all.
