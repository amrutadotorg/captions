1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:17,087
In the nature, if you see, everything circulates in a very regular manner.

2
00:00:17,288 --> 00:00:23,390
For example in the winter time the leaves have to fall down,

3
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:32,461
because the nitrogen of the leaves 
has to go into the Mother Earth to nourish the trees.

4
00:00:32,630 --> 00:00:40,851
Moreover the Mother Earth must get sun’s rays.

5
00:00:41,052 --> 00:00:47,408
so there should be no leaves and the sun’s rays can penetrate

6
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:51,384
into the Mother Earth to nourish her.

7
00:00:52,575 --> 00:01:02,673
Then the trees when they are nourished 
they again become green and lush

8
00:01:02,874 --> 00:01:13,265
so that they receive the sun’s light and make chlorophyll out of them.

9
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:24,443
Also they suck in the water from the Mother Earth 
and throw them in the atmosphere

10
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:30,045
to act as catalyst for the rain to come.

11
00:01:30,246 --> 00:01:33,358
Then the rain comes during the rainy season,

12
00:01:33,559 --> 00:01:45,508
then again nourished with water the life again [starts].

13
00:01:45,709 --> 00:01:52,389
They lose all their leaves and the whole circle 
goes on in a beautiful manner.

14
00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:56,974
There is no reversion, it is just a continuous circle

15
00:01:57,175 --> 00:02:03,742
going in a very beautiful manner to create and recreate.

16
00:02:05,862 --> 00:02:14,977
But with the interference of man nature gets disturbed.

17
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:20,812
Also you can enhance the nature,

18
00:02:21,177 --> 00:02:27,916
you can save the nature’s destruction which could be natural also.

19
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:37,036
But when you get your realisation, when you get your realisation,

20
00:02:37,237 --> 00:02:43,816
then with your vibrations you can save all natural things

21
00:02:44,017 --> 00:02:49,237
that are decaying under the modern influence.

22
00:02:49,491 --> 00:02:56,128
So first of all, we see the effect of realisation

23
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:01,315
how it acts as Ekadasha Rudra.

24
00:03:01,516 --> 00:03:12,722
It destroys the negative forces which are trying to destroy the nature.

25
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:20,836
One day I am sure you all will evolve to such a state

26
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:29,362
that even your glance is sufficient to make the trees grow,

27
00:03:29,563 --> 00:03:37,384
to make the fruits sweet, to make the flowers fragrant.

28
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:45,966
That’s possible because our growth is showing results.

29
00:03:46,167 --> 00:03:49,349
Slowly, slowly it is showing results,

30
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,064
because you should not be stunned, you should not be shocked,

31
00:03:53,281 --> 00:04:00,320
so that you can see for yourself 
what you are and what you are achieving.

32
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:06,749
But to allow this force within us to grow,

33
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:12,066
first of all, we should be very introspective,

34
00:04:12,313 --> 00:04:19,309
we should try to see ourselves, what is happening to us?

35
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,909
We must watch our steps.

36
00:04:22,152 --> 00:04:29,665
Are we moving towards our construction
 or towards our destruction?

37
00:04:29,866 --> 00:04:32,717
What are we doing?
