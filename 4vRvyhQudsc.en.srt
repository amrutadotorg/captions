ETVD Unknown TC:BC 13-09-2015

3
00:04:22,045 --> 00:04:31,445
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Ganesha.

4
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:40,445
You all know what a powerful deity He is.

5
00:04:40,605 --> 00:04:45,784
His power comes from his innocence.

6
00:04:45,944 --> 00:04:50,586
When we see small children we are automatically

7
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:54,205
compelled towards them

8
00:04:54,365 --> 00:05:01,725
and also we want to love them, kiss them and be with them.

9
00:05:01,885 --> 00:05:06,645
And very innocent they are,

10
00:05:07,925 --> 00:05:10,245
extremely innocent,

11
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:16,765
and when we worship Shri Ganesha

12
00:05:16,925 --> 00:05:23,725
we have to know if we have been really innocent or not.

13
00:05:23,925 --> 00:05:30,605
These days people have become extremely cunning,

14
00:05:30,765 --> 00:05:34,405
and they don’t mind any amount of cunning.

15
00:05:34,565 --> 00:05:37,965
They play all kinds of cunning games on others

16
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:42,005
who are innocent and simple.

17
00:05:42,165 --> 00:05:45,405
They can justify themselves always

18
00:05:45,565 --> 00:05:50,485
that whatever they are doing is the right thing in these modern times

19
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:53,765
when everybody is so cunning.

20
00:05:53,925 --> 00:06:04,005
This cunningness can take you to the other extreme of right side,

21
00:06:04,205 --> 00:06:07,325
which is very much punishable,

22
00:06:07,605 --> 00:06:13,165
in the sense that some people develop all kinds of problems,

23
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:17,165
which are physical, you can say.

24
00:06:17,525 --> 00:06:25,485
Like their hands can get paralyzed or their leg can get paralyzed.

25
00:06:26,445 --> 00:06:29,685
Also, they can have other troubles

26
00:06:29,845 --> 00:06:33,365
with their liver treatments and all that.

27
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:39,405
All this comes up. Then to punish them

28
00:06:39,565 --> 00:06:45,085
a disease of psychosomatic nature might set in.

29
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:48,485
At this time, when you have these problems,

30
00:06:48,645 --> 00:06:51,885
all such people, who suffer from the right side,

31
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:54,925
should worship Shri Ganesha.

32
00:06:55,165 --> 00:07:02,485
For example these days, life is very much busy with all of you.

33
00:07:02,645 --> 00:07:07,965
You are extremely busy with your work and you are doing

34
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:12,165
extra work, I should say, than normal.

35
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:16,885
But you think you are doing a very great job of God.

36
00:07:17,045 --> 00:07:21,325
As a result Shri Ganesha is neglected

37
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:28,805
and such a man can become either very dry or very self indulgent.

38
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:31,605
One of the two things come up

39
00:07:31,765 --> 00:07:35,925
and he does not know where he is going.

40
00:07:36,085 --> 00:07:42,125
The only thing that keeps you in the middle,

41
00:07:42,285 --> 00:07:46,765
in Sahaja Yoga, is Shri Ganesha’s Puja,

42
00:07:46,925 --> 00:07:54,125
Shri Ganesha’s worship by which you can always be in the center.

43
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:57,482
All these diseases of the right side

44
00:07:57,642 --> 00:08:02,045
can be cured by Shri Ganesha’s Puja.

45
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:08,005
Now there are various ways people worship Shri Ganesha

46
00:08:09,005 --> 00:08:15,445
but there is a simple way to remember him

47
00:08:15,605 --> 00:08:21,005
and sit before his photograph and take vibrations from him.

48
00:08:21,165 --> 00:08:24,925
That’s the best way you can balance yourself.

49
00:08:25,085 --> 00:08:29,845
There are so many worries, there are so many struggles you have.

50
00:08:30,005 --> 00:08:33,685
All these can be neutralized by Shri Ganesha.

51
00:08:33,885 --> 00:08:38,565
Though innocent, He is extremely clever

52
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:43,405
and when he comes to your help you are amazed.

53
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:48,365
How he works it out and how he removes all the hurdles

54
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:51,045
and all the worries from you.

55
00:08:51,205 --> 00:08:55,125
So this is the most important deity we have.

56
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:58,485
Though its a very simple deity.

57
00:08:58,645 --> 00:09:02,165
This Mooladhara chakra is very very complicated.

58
00:09:02,325 --> 00:09:05,525
It is one of the most complicated, chakras I think,

59
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:14,205
because it has many waves, it has many compartments.

60
00:09:14,365 --> 00:09:21,205
We can say which all the time are vibrating and oscillating.

61
00:09:21,365 --> 00:09:24,085
So to steady down these

62
00:09:24,245 --> 00:09:31,285
you should try to be absolutely dedicated to Shri Ganesha.

63
00:09:31,525 --> 00:09:38,485
Shri Ganesha, as I told you, was incarnated as Jesus Christ,

64
00:09:38,685 --> 00:09:43,445
and Jesus was also a very innocent person.

65
00:09:43,605 --> 00:09:47,605
If he was not innocent, He would not have been crucified,

66
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:51,925
but he was not a cunning fellow to see the cunning of others.

67
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:57,325
His own disciple deceived him and still he knew who it was,

68
00:09:57,485 --> 00:09:59,445
he never said who it was.

69
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:04,405
If you see his life, its full of innocent beauty,

70
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:11,005
is such a simple hearted personality, such a good personality

71
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:13,885
and wherever he saw anything wrong done

72
00:10:14,045 --> 00:10:16,725
he used to go all out to fight it.

73
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,845
Same is Shri Ganesha.

74
00:10:19,005 --> 00:10:23,925
Shri Ganesha’s blessings are very important for all the people

75
00:10:24,085 --> 00:10:28,965
who are specially prone to some sort of a hurdle

76
00:10:29,125 --> 00:10:32,285
or ‘Sankata as they call it’. He is called as Sankata Vimochan,

77
00:10:32,445 --> 00:10:37,125
the one who takes you out of all the hurdles of life.

78
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:41,565
So many of you have experienced how he has helped you

79
00:10:41,725 --> 00:10:46,325
in different troubles and hurdles and also

80
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:49,965
different type of very very difficult times.

81
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:54,565
It is his style that he manages things so well

82
00:10:54,725 --> 00:10:57,405
because he is a Ganapati.

83
00:10:57,565 --> 00:11:03,525
Ganapati means the one who is the Lord of the Ganas.

84
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:08,285
As I have told you Ganas exist within us.

85
00:11:08,445 --> 00:11:16,445
Very nicely settled down as these bodies, small, small bodies

86
00:11:16,605 --> 00:11:20,525
who report if there is any problem.

87
00:11:20,685 --> 00:11:24,805
They report to the brain that there is a problem

88
00:11:24,965 --> 00:11:31,605
and on the sternum bone is the residence

89
00:11:31,765 --> 00:11:37,405
or you can say the throne of the Goddess Durga.

90
00:11:37,565 --> 00:11:46,405
So whenever there is any problem we are found into some trouble,

91
00:11:46,565 --> 00:11:50,125
sternum bone starts vibrating

92
00:11:50,285 --> 00:11:56,765
and these bodies which are Ganas get the information.

93
00:11:56,925 --> 00:12:00,925
Antibodies they are called in the medical terminology.

94
00:12:01,085 --> 00:12:06,045
Then these Ganas attack. They can target also.

95
00:12:06,205 --> 00:12:10,165
They know how to target the troubles and attack it,

96
00:12:10,325 --> 00:12:14,285
one may think that only the people who are suffering medically

97
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:17,085
are helped by Ganas is not true.

98
00:12:17,245 --> 00:12:20,565
Also the people who are mentally upset,

99
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:25,445
who are mentally suffering are also helped by the Ganas.

100
00:12:25,605 --> 00:12:30,725
These Ganas are so good at targeting their problems

101
00:12:30,885 --> 00:12:35,805
that sometimes we are surprised how things are worked out.

102
00:12:35,965 --> 00:12:42,445
For example say something happens to someone, some child, somewhere.

103
00:12:42,605 --> 00:12:47,245
Now his parents start crying for Mother

104
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:51,365
and the Mother is the Durga say, then what happens,

105
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:55,125
that they immediately rush to that place

106
00:12:55,285 --> 00:12:59,765
and miraculously they cure the boy, miraculously they say.

107
00:12:59,925 --> 00:13:03,525
So many miraculous thing that have happened in your life

108
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:10,325
you cannot explain, but they are all due to this Ganapati’s Ganas.

109
00:13:10,485 --> 00:13:14,085
They are also small like him

110
00:13:14,245 --> 00:13:17,845
and they are very active and very alert.

111
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:19,965
They never sleep.

112
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:24,165
Anytime there is any trouble these Ganas will go

113
00:13:24,325 --> 00:13:29,165
and attack the problem and find out solution for him.

114
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:35,485
It is something unbelievable how they act and how they inform.

115
00:13:36,245 --> 00:13:39,885
I can give you so many examples that have happened like this.

116
00:13:40,045 --> 00:13:44,205
For example there was a boy who got drowned

117
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:50,605
in one of our ashrams in America in the swimming pool.

118
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,685
They were all jumping in the swimming pool,

119
00:13:52,845 --> 00:13:55,405
I didn’t like the idea of swimming pool very much

120
00:13:55,565 --> 00:13:57,725
because there were children.

121
00:13:57,885 --> 00:14:00,445
So one boy fell down into that

122
00:14:00,605 --> 00:14:03,805
and was inside for about 15 to 20 minutes.

123
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:05,925
Nobody knew he was there.

124
00:14:06,085 --> 00:14:11,605
So then they tried to find out the body of the boy

125
00:14:11,765 --> 00:14:15,325
and then they found out he was not there. Where has he gone?

126
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:20,285
Then they discovered that he was in that swimming pool.

127
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:23,965
After that they got so frightened

128
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,725
and they said we just prayed to you, Mother to save this boy.

129
00:14:27,885 --> 00:14:30,405
Surprisingly, I never telephone to any Ashram,

130
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:32,835
I didn’t know even the address.

131
00:14:32,995 --> 00:14:37,405
But I asked to telephone to this number,

132
00:14:37,565 --> 00:14:40,485
on my own. I don’t know anybody’s numbers

133
00:14:40,645 --> 00:14:46,245
and, when I telephoned, one of the leaders came there

134
00:14:46,405 --> 00:14:49,485
and I told him I know the boy has fallen into the water

135
00:14:49,645 --> 00:14:51,205
and he will be saved.

136
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:53,365
Nobody had told me anything.

137
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,125
“Don’t worry he will be perfectly alright.”

138
00:14:56,285 --> 00:15:00,965
Then they brought out the boy and he was treated

139
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:05,005
by the doctors also but also with vibrations

140
00:15:05,165 --> 00:15:07,685
and today that boy is perfectly alright,

141
00:15:07,845 --> 00:15:10,725
while the doctors had said he can never survive.

142
00:15:10,885 --> 00:15:13,325
If there is one chance of his surviving,

143
00:15:13,485 --> 00:15:18,405
he will be like a dead body, in a coma all the time.

144
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:21,525
This boy, I have met him this time, when I went to America.

145
00:15:21,685 --> 00:15:23,605
So, like this, so many things happen

146
00:15:23,765 --> 00:15:29,725
and people tell me that Mother its your ‘kripa’,

147
00:15:29,885 --> 00:15:33,325
your blessings that this has happened.

148
00:15:33,485 --> 00:15:36,325
In a way, it is very distantly, I should say,

149
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,925
but because of Shri Ganesha.

150
00:15:39,085 --> 00:15:41,565
Now Shri Ganesha’s another quality is that

151
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:45,085
he is extremely obedient to Mother.

152
00:15:45,245 --> 00:15:51,085
He does not recognize even Shiva, Vihnu, any one.

153
00:15:51,245 --> 00:15:54,685
To him his Mother is everything.

154
00:15:54,845 --> 00:15:57,845
So he can fight with his father, Shiva,

155
00:15:58,005 --> 00:16:03,525
he can fight with anyone because to him is complete obedience

156
00:16:03,685 --> 00:16:11,045
and absolutely quick ‘Tatpar’, just quickly understands

157
00:16:11,205 --> 00:16:15,805
what is the desire of the Mother and he works it out.

158
00:16:15,965 --> 00:16:21,365
His style is otherwise very innocent, simple, child like

159
00:16:21,525 --> 00:16:24,685
but His work is tremendous.

160
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:29,565
Now these Ganas are also very innocent people, very innocent

161
00:16:29,725 --> 00:16:35,485
but when told that you have to attend to a particular problem,

162
00:16:35,645 --> 00:16:39,325
they are extremely quick and they are very fast.

163
00:16:39,485 --> 00:16:45,605
The another thing within is that he respects people who are chaste,

164
00:16:45,765 --> 00:16:50,285
who have chastity as the prime thing in their life.

165
00:16:50,445 --> 00:16:52,885
Chastity is very much worshipped by him.

166
00:16:53,045 --> 00:16:56,045
Its not only in women but also in men,

167
00:16:56,205 --> 00:16:59,365
he expects chastity to be present.

168
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:04,725
After getting realization you should be absolutely chaste people,

169
00:17:04,885 --> 00:17:08,125
you shouldn’t have your eyes rolling around every where

170
00:17:08,285 --> 00:17:14,205
and sort of what you can call a very bad method

171
00:17:14,365 --> 00:17:18,525
of communicating with young women and young men

172
00:17:18,685 --> 00:17:21,445
and spoiling your chastity.

173
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:24,445
Even your eyes should be clean,

174
00:17:24,605 --> 00:17:27,125
even your thoughts should be cleaned.

175
00:17:27,285 --> 00:17:31,205
For that you should introspect and see for yourself

176
00:17:31,365 --> 00:17:33,805
what mistakes you have committed

177
00:17:33,965 --> 00:17:40,805
and what kind of an unchaste behavior you have.

178
00:17:40,965 --> 00:17:46,245
You have to correct yourself and ask Shri Ganesha to forgive you.

179
00:17:46,405 --> 00:17:49,765
If you ask for forgiveness, he can forgive anything.

180
00:17:49,925 --> 00:17:54,165
He is so innocent and beautiful that he forgives you,

181
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:56,965
but that is a very important thing.

182
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:02,285
Our whole morality depends on our idea of chastity.

183
00:18:02,445 --> 00:18:04,005
We should be very chaste.

184
00:18:04,165 --> 00:18:08,205
So many religions have come and they have talked about chastity.

185
00:18:08,365 --> 00:18:12,005
But religions have become so useless now,

186
00:18:12,165 --> 00:18:15,445
have become without any basis,

187
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:26,125
without any proper execution, of what is written for them.

188
00:18:26,285 --> 00:18:29,685
They do all kinds of things and they call themselves

189
00:18:29,845 --> 00:18:34,045
Hindus, Muslims, Christians, all kinds of religions.

190
00:18:34,205 --> 00:18:37,245
Actually the religions have failed completely

191
00:18:37,405 --> 00:18:42,245
and that’s why Shri Ganesha gets after them.

192
00:18:42,405 --> 00:18:44,525
Another thing about Shri Ganesh

193
00:18:44,685 --> 00:18:47,885
is that he is created out of the Mother earth.

194
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,565
He is absolutely created out of the mother Earth.

195
00:18:51,725 --> 00:18:58,405
So if he doesn’t like people of some country,

196
00:18:58,565 --> 00:19:03,365
who are doing black magic, or who are doing fundamentalism

197
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:10,125
and where people are also having very bad morals.

198
00:19:10,285 --> 00:19:14,925
He creates problems for them. What happens that

199
00:19:15,085 --> 00:19:21,965
He tells the Mother earth to create the earthquakes.

200
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:24,509
Earthquake takes place in places where

201
00:19:24,669 --> 00:19:28,325
there is no respect of chastity,

202
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:32,325
also where there are fundamentalist

203
00:19:32,485 --> 00:19:39,325
and also where there are people who are worshipping the black magic.

204
00:19:39,485 --> 00:19:44,245
This kind of people are attacked by him through his Mother.

205
00:19:44,405 --> 00:19:46,685
So the Mother earth also understands.

206
00:19:46,845 --> 00:19:50,285
Now we have so many earthquakes,

207
00:19:50,445 --> 00:19:52,725
one in Turkey you know, one in Taiwan,

208
00:19:52,885 --> 00:19:55,885
but not a single Sahaja Yogi has died.

209
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,805
So he protects them.

210
00:19:57,965 --> 00:20:02,685
He has discrimination and only such people, who are of this kind,

211
00:20:02,845 --> 00:20:04,885
he tries to destroy them,

212
00:20:05,045 --> 00:20:09,005
and he has destroyed many like this even before.

213
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:19,925
Also, the Mother earth’s powers he has got, is that he is magnetic,

214
00:20:20,085 --> 00:20:22,805
he attracts people towards himself,

215
00:20:22,965 --> 00:20:27,805
people take to him very easily as we take to children very easily.

216
00:20:27,965 --> 00:20:32,605
So that is magnetic power that he has got within himself.

217
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:38,285
Now, you will be surprised this magnet exists also in the birds,

218
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,485
also in many animals but specially in the birds.

219
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:45,205
That’s how they can follow direction where they have to go.

220
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:49,965
They are flying from, say Siberia, all the way, flying to Australia.

221
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:53,685
How do they fly? And again they come back to the same place.

222
00:20:53,845 --> 00:21:00,365
It also is in the fishes. Fishes also are found say

223
00:21:00,525 --> 00:21:05,285
in the waters which are coming from some hills,

224
00:21:05,445 --> 00:21:09,845
so they come to the plains for some time and again God knows how,

225
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:12,165
they go back to their own place.

226
00:21:12,325 --> 00:21:15,525
So going back to the same place is only possible

227
00:21:15,685 --> 00:21:18,525
if there is a way of knowing the direction.

228
00:21:18,685 --> 00:21:22,965
But they know the direction, they have a sense of direction,

229
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:27,085
also they are bound by their own qualities.

230
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:32,125
For example a snake will be a snake, a dog will be a dog,

231
00:21:32,285 --> 00:21:34,525
and a lion will be a lion.

232
00:21:34,685 --> 00:21:38,285
But human beings have perhaps all the animals within them.

233
00:21:38,445 --> 00:21:40,565
So they could be anything, you can’t say

234
00:21:40,725 --> 00:21:44,605
and they are too cunning to admit that they can be anything.

235
00:21:44,765 --> 00:21:47,365
And once they become anything like that

236
00:21:47,525 --> 00:21:52,125
you are amazed how these people can be of such a low level

237
00:21:52,285 --> 00:21:54,685
when they are human beings.

238
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:59,445
But it is so because Ganesha has not been respected in their lives.

239
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:04,525
So they can go to any level, any place. Another example,

240
00:22:04,685 --> 00:22:09,005
I give you a very big earthquake we had in India, in Latur.

241
00:22:09,165 --> 00:22:14,005
In Latur this was the fourteenth day of Shri Ganesha

242
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,085
where they take Shri Ganesha and put it in the sea

243
00:22:17,245 --> 00:22:21,685
or in the water of a river. So there, in Latur,

244
00:22:21,845 --> 00:22:29,525
these people have been having a nice statue of Shri Ganesha.

245
00:22:29,685 --> 00:22:31,725
Before the statue they dance

246
00:22:31,885 --> 00:22:38,285
and they have now started playing very dirty, very bad,

247
00:22:38,445 --> 00:22:43,965
music from some very funny films or something.

248
00:22:44,125 --> 00:22:47,085
It’s so bad that you just can’t bear it.

249
00:22:47,245 --> 00:22:51,365
Very bad and that upsets Shri Ganesha.

250
00:22:51,525 --> 00:22:55,725
So like that they were doing to this one statue that they had

251
00:22:55,885 --> 00:22:58,165
and they were dancing before it.

252
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:03,925
But when they put the statue in the water and they came back home,

253
00:23:04,085 --> 00:23:08,365
they got drunk and when they got drunk, they started dancing

254
00:23:08,525 --> 00:23:12,885
with that drinking and saying Jai Ganesha, Jai Ganesha.

255
00:23:13,045 --> 00:23:16,525
At that time the earth moved

256
00:23:16,685 --> 00:23:26,285
and the earthquake took away all of them inside the earth itself.

257
00:23:26,445 --> 00:23:28,765
They all disappeared into earth.

258
00:23:28,925 --> 00:23:32,085
Apart from that there were many others also

259
00:23:32,245 --> 00:23:36,485
who were doing this kind of thing, were taken into the mother earth.

260
00:23:36,645 --> 00:23:40,325
And our Ashram was there, a kind of a center

261
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:48,085
and around the center there was a very beautiful land

262
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:54,165
but he did not touch that land. Around is about at least

263
00:23:54,325 --> 00:23:59,445
quite a long distance, a big gap came in

264
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:08,725
and there was a opening in the mother earth all around the center

265
00:24:08,885 --> 00:24:13,845
and nobody was harmed: They were all at home.

266
00:24:14,165 --> 00:24:16,325
They were all right.

267
00:24:16,485 --> 00:24:21,445
But this happened, that our Ashram was not at all touched

268
00:24:21,605 --> 00:24:24,121
and this is how they saved the Ashram

269
00:24:24,281 --> 00:24:27,085
and not a single Sahaja Yogi died.

270
00:24:27,245 --> 00:24:31,485
It is really very remarkable how the protection is given

271
00:24:31,645 --> 00:24:35,405
by Shri Ganesha and his Ganas.

272
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:38,045
So we must respect his Ganas,

273
00:24:38,205 --> 00:24:42,805
very important is to see that they are all around within us,

274
00:24:42,965 --> 00:24:45,005
they are acting within us.

275
00:24:45,165 --> 00:24:48,325
They see us what sort of person you are,

276
00:24:48,485 --> 00:24:53,245
and in case you try to dislodge Shri Ganesha

277
00:24:53,405 --> 00:24:55,408
by your misbehavior

278
00:24:55,568 --> 00:24:59,845
they try to see that you again go back to normal.

279
00:25:00,005 --> 00:25:02,005
They give you a chance many a times.

280
00:25:02,165 --> 00:25:09,645
But even then you go on with your cunning and ideas about your ego,

281
00:25:09,805 --> 00:25:16,365
you are very badly hit by him and that is the biggest,

282
00:25:16,525 --> 00:25:20,445
I should say, calamity for you people.

283
00:25:20,605 --> 00:25:23,205
So you must worship Shri Ganesha

284
00:25:23,365 --> 00:25:26,605
but I always say don’t worship every Shri Ganesha

285
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:32,165
which is being created by those, we can say, artisans.

286
00:25:32,325 --> 00:25:35,365
Because God knows what sort of Artisans they are.

287
00:25:35,525 --> 00:25:38,045
For money’s sake they might be making Ganesha

288
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:44,605
and they might not have got any idea of Chastity.

289
00:25:44,765 --> 00:25:49,565
Such people make these Ganesha and then you worship those Ganeshas,

290
00:25:49,725 --> 00:25:52,445
so we are not at all helped by this.

291
00:25:52,605 --> 00:25:55,325
That’s why Mohammad Saheb has said,

292
00:25:55,485 --> 00:25:59,245
don’t do any worship of any idol

293
00:25:59,405 --> 00:26:03,125
because these idols have been created by human beings

294
00:26:03,285 --> 00:26:07,925
who are not authorized to do that. They are not Swayambhus.

295
00:26:08,085 --> 00:26:10,405
They are not created by the mother earth

296
00:26:10,565 --> 00:26:13,324
but are copied by people

297
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:16,965
who are just wanting to make money out of them.

298
00:26:17,125 --> 00:26:20,765
So that’s, how any idol you get,

299
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:27,045
say, from the shops need not be worshiped,

300
00:26:27,205 --> 00:26:30,405
it is not to be worshiped, any idol whatsoever.

301
00:26:30,565 --> 00:26:33,245
So whatever is not there,

302
00:26:33,405 --> 00:26:37,445
we should not worship because it is made by somebody

303
00:26:37,605 --> 00:26:41,045
who has very bad vibrations, who is a cheat,

304
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:45,165
who is very cunning and thinks no end of himself.

305
00:26:45,325 --> 00:26:48,565
With such a person if you buy a Shri Ganesha

306
00:26:48,725 --> 00:26:51,605
it is going to harm you, is not going to help you.

307
00:26:51,765 --> 00:26:56,405
You can have it for decoration in the house but not for worship.

308
00:26:56,565 --> 00:27:00,445
There is no photograph of real Shri Ganesha, no photograph.

309
00:27:00,605 --> 00:27:06,925
There are eight Shri Ganeshas who came out of mother earth.

310
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:12,325
I have seen them. But in those places the pujaris,

311
00:27:12,485 --> 00:27:16,605
the people who are the priest are horrible, horrible people.

312
00:27:16,765 --> 00:27:21,285
I went to one of them and he said, “I am getting Asthama”,

313
00:27:21,445 --> 00:27:26,205
“I am getting paralysis, how is it I am worshipping Shri Ganesha,

314
00:27:26,365 --> 00:27:29,405
my forefathers have worshipped Shri Ganesha

315
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:32,605
and how he is doing this to us.”

316
00:27:32,765 --> 00:27:39,125
I said, you just introspect yourself, what kind of a life you lead,

317
00:27:39,285 --> 00:27:45,365
what do you do, are you really worthy of Shri Ganesha’s Pujari?

318
00:27:45,525 --> 00:27:46,885
And then he realized it.

319
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:49,725
I said, “I will cure you now. Its all right

320
00:27:49,885 --> 00:27:55,165
but afterwards you see to it that you become an innocent personality.

321
00:27:55,325 --> 00:27:59,605
Try to lead an innocent life, not of outwitting another

322
00:27:59,765 --> 00:28:02,285
and being very cunning and clever.

323
00:28:02,445 --> 00:28:07,005
Shri Ganesha’s troubles, are really, I can’t count them even,

324
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:14,445
how much it can hamper, or how much it can give you trouble,

325
00:28:14,605 --> 00:28:19,965
how much it can take you nearer to your death.

326
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:25,205
He is so powerful, because all his energy is

327
00:28:25,365 --> 00:28:28,485
for the divine work of his Mother, all his energy.

328
00:28:28,645 --> 00:28:31,405
He doesn’t do anything, he doesn’t want anything.

329
00:28:31,565 --> 00:28:37,805
Just all his energy is for that and he is asking for what is simple,

330
00:28:37,965 --> 00:28:41,045
what you can call Modaka, a kind of a thing

331
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:46,725
they make out of coconut. That’s what he eats.

332
00:28:46,885 --> 00:28:53,765
His body is so subtle and so, so powerful

333
00:28:53,925 --> 00:29:02,165
that he can move mountains after mountains.

334
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:08,725
With his simplicity, with his sweetness, and with his innocence

335
00:29:08,885 --> 00:29:16,045
he can really change people. People who are very harsh,

336
00:29:16,205 --> 00:29:19,325
can be changed.

337
00:29:20,245 --> 00:29:25,045
His symbol as we have seen is a Swastika,

338
00:29:25,205 --> 00:29:27,285
of the right direction.

339
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:33,325
But if it is the other way round Swastika, then that can destroy.

340
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:37,885
When It was used by Hitler in the beginning,

341
00:29:38,045 --> 00:29:41,405
it was the right type and he was successful.

342
00:29:41,565 --> 00:29:44,565
But then what happened, they had stencils

343
00:29:44,725 --> 00:29:47,325
and they started using it from the other side.

344
00:29:47,485 --> 00:29:50,605
So it was from the left side, they started other way round

345
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:53,885
and then they were all destroyed.

346
00:29:54,045 --> 00:29:58,005
How powerful is Shri Ganesha’s Swastika, you can say.

347
00:29:58,165 --> 00:30:00,253
Also we have proved now

348
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:04,365
that Swastika if you see from left to the right,

349
00:30:04,525 --> 00:30:08,085
is actually from the Carbon atom.

350
00:30:08,245 --> 00:30:10,805
The carbon atom has got Swastika

351
00:30:10,965 --> 00:30:17,765
and the whole of this chakra is made of Carbon atoms,

352
00:30:17,925 --> 00:30:19,805
all put in series.

353
00:30:19,965 --> 00:30:25,125
Now if you look at it from the left side, you have proved it now,

354
00:30:25,285 --> 00:30:27,845
look at it from the left side to right side,

355
00:30:28,005 --> 00:30:31,845
what you see is Omkar.

356
00:30:32,005 --> 00:30:34,645
If you see it from right side to left side,

357
00:30:34,805 --> 00:30:36,405
you see the Swastika,

358
00:30:36,565 --> 00:30:43,285
and if you see from down below upward then it looks like a Cross.

359
00:30:43,445 --> 00:30:48,645
So it proves that Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ

360
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:53,485
and he is the one who is worshipped all over the world,

361
00:30:53,645 --> 00:30:57,085
is already written in the Devi Mahatmayam if you read it,

362
00:30:57,245 --> 00:31:01,165
is all clearly written about him how he became an egg

363
00:31:01,325 --> 00:31:04,485
and out of the half of the egg became Christ

364
00:31:04,645 --> 00:31:09,245
and half of the egg was Shri Ganesha.

365
00:31:09,405 --> 00:31:13,445
All these things are there but we cannot understand it

366
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,205
because we are confused.

367
00:31:15,365 --> 00:31:17,485
We don’t want to see it in a proper sense

368
00:31:17,645 --> 00:31:19,525
that this is already written there.

369
00:31:19,685 --> 00:31:25,125
So those who worship Christ, also worship Shri Ganesha

370
00:31:25,285 --> 00:31:32,525
and whatever you say to Christ you are saying it to Shri Ganesha.

371
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:38,805
They are not two, they are one and absolutely one with each other.

372
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:41,805
All the things I have told you about Christ,

373
00:31:41,965 --> 00:31:48,285
you can try to find out and you will prove it.

374
00:31:48,445 --> 00:31:51,445
Like Christ had these two fingers,

375
00:31:51,605 --> 00:31:55,925
this means one finger is for the Vishudhi as we say Shri Krishna

376
00:31:56,085 --> 00:32:00,565
and this one is Vishnu’s means this is his father’s.

377
00:32:00,725 --> 00:32:04,445
That means his father was Vishnu or Shri Krishna.

378
00:32:04,605 --> 00:32:08,125
Very clearly he used to do, why didn’t he use other fingers,

379
00:32:08,285 --> 00:32:10,885
only these two fingers why did he use.

380
00:32:11,045 --> 00:32:13,710
Pointing out towards his father

381
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,785
who was Shri Vishnu and Shri Krishna.

382
00:32:18,125 --> 00:32:21,365
It is easy to understand what I am saying,

383
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,845
if you see the vibrations of Shri Ganesha.

384
00:32:25,005 --> 00:32:31,685
If you see his vibrations and think of him you will be amazed,

385
00:32:31,845 --> 00:32:37,245
that your Agnya will open out, you will become thoughtless,

386
00:32:37,405 --> 00:32:41,405
because he is the Jesus and he is on the Agnya.

387
00:32:41,565 --> 00:32:43,341
So it all opens out

388
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:48,917
and all the stupid ideas about wrecking the Agnya,

389
00:32:49,085 --> 00:32:53,045
this and that is all neutralized because you see for yourself,

390
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:58,325
just the name of Shri Ganesha can open your Agnya.

391
00:32:58,485 --> 00:33:02,485
The cunningness that comes from Agnya is absolutely finished.

392
00:33:02,645 --> 00:33:04,445
You are no more cunning.

393
00:33:04,605 --> 00:33:11,165
When you see this innocence on your forehead,

394
00:33:11,325 --> 00:33:16,405
you are amazed at yourself and all such ideas just disappear.

395
00:33:16,565 --> 00:33:21,565
You cannot think of something very cunning and harmful to others.

396
00:33:21,725 --> 00:33:28,525
You are completely changed when the Agnya is absolutely opened out.

397
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:33,405
This one is a very big blessing to us that we all have

398
00:33:33,565 --> 00:33:37,765
this Muladhara Chakra now put into proper thing.

399
00:33:37,925 --> 00:33:40,965
When you sit on the ground also it helps more

400
00:33:41,125 --> 00:33:47,176
because the mother of Shri Ganesha

401
00:33:47,336 --> 00:33:51,096
is this Prithvi, is this earth, the mother earth

402
00:33:51,256 --> 00:33:54,685
and that’s why we should look after the mother earth.

403
00:33:54,845 --> 00:33:56,845
We don’t look after the mother earth.

404
00:33:57,005 --> 00:34:00,325
We don’t understand the value of mother earth.

405
00:34:00,485 --> 00:34:04,445
Actually in Indian culture it is that

406
00:34:04,605 --> 00:34:07,605
when you are getting up in the morning,

407
00:34:07,765 --> 00:34:12,685
you must say Namaskar to the Mother earth

408
00:34:12,845 --> 00:34:17,125
because saying that I bow to you, O, Mother earth

409
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:20,365
because I am touching you with my feet.

410
00:34:20,525 --> 00:34:22,845
Such respect you should have for Mother earth,

411
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:24,725
then you won’t exploit it,

412
00:34:24,885 --> 00:34:28,485
you won’t have today’s problems of pollution and this and that.

413
00:34:28,645 --> 00:34:31,485
It all comes out of our ignorance

414
00:34:31,645 --> 00:34:36,045
that the Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha

415
00:34:36,205 --> 00:34:39,885
who’s chakra we have got as Mooladhara.

416
00:34:40,045 --> 00:34:44,525
If you understand this you will be able to understand,

417
00:34:44,685 --> 00:34:47,605
what is to be done.

418
00:34:47,765 --> 00:34:50,685
The mother earth itself we should look after,

419
00:34:50,845 --> 00:34:54,445
we can glorify her, we can beautify her,

420
00:34:54,605 --> 00:34:56,845
we can do all kinds of things

421
00:34:57,005 --> 00:35:02,525
but the way we are exploiting the mother earth is a wrong idea,

422
00:35:02,685 --> 00:35:07,365
is very wrong because it is harming us with pollution.

423
00:35:07,525 --> 00:35:10,605
To cut down the trees, to cut down every thing

424
00:35:10,765 --> 00:35:15,325
that mother has produced and just to use it for money

425
00:35:15,485 --> 00:35:17,365
is a very wrong thing.

426
00:35:17,525 --> 00:35:21,125
One should think about it and when you cut one tree also

427
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,285
you should put another one there.

428
00:35:23,445 --> 00:35:26,805
That is the beauty of the Mother earth,

429
00:35:26,965 --> 00:35:31,405
all the greenery, every thing is the beauty of the Mother earth.

430
00:35:31,565 --> 00:35:39,005
Many people have no interest in gardening or in nature, no interest.

431
00:35:39,165 --> 00:35:42,365
I don’t know how they live but they do

432
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:48,525
without taking any interest in gardening or in the nature.

433
00:35:48,685 --> 00:35:52,565
Nature is so beautiful, just look at the nature,

434
00:35:52,725 --> 00:35:58,605
it is never smelling, is never dirty, every leaf is so organized

435
00:35:58,765 --> 00:36:01,765
that it should get the sunrays.

436
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:03,485
There is no quarrel about it.

437
00:36:03,645 --> 00:36:07,285
They are so well organized, everything is so beautiful

438
00:36:07,445 --> 00:36:12,565
and it is never destroyed also by any animals. You will be amazed.

439
00:36:12,725 --> 00:36:14,925
The animals also don’t destroy,

440
00:36:15,085 --> 00:36:18,125
at the most they might eat some grass or something,

441
00:36:18,285 --> 00:36:21,965
but normally animals do not destroy any tree,

442
00:36:22,125 --> 00:36:24,605
do not destroy anything

443
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:30,645
as we destroy the Mother earth for our own use.

444
00:36:30,805 --> 00:36:33,925
Whatever may be the cry for this,

445
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:37,845
we have to understand that we have to respect to the Mother earth.

446
00:36:38,005 --> 00:36:40,845
Mother earth is the mother of Shri Ganesha,

447
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:44,965
who is our, you should say the eldest Sahaja Yogi.

448
00:36:45,125 --> 00:36:49,965
He never had to take to yoga but he is in Yoga all the time.

449
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,525
He is the greatest yogi we have

450
00:36:52,685 --> 00:36:56,125
and the way he is doing right things all the time.

451
00:36:56,285 --> 00:37:02,405
He never does anything wrong, never and he is so capable

452
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:10,925
of getting to the position of any great deity that is possible,

453
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:13,805
I would say. He is the greatest deity we have

454
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,925
and we should really worship him.

455
00:37:16,085 --> 00:37:18,735
Through him all deities are worshiped

456
00:37:18,895 --> 00:37:26,125
and are made happy and blissful.

457
00:37:26,285 --> 00:37:31,765
So this is today’s thing was that I was just thinking that

458
00:37:31,925 --> 00:37:37,045
nowadays, in modern times how we have become shameless,

459
00:37:37,205 --> 00:37:48,325
how we have tried to trouble our chastity, for kind of a honor.

460
00:37:48,485 --> 00:37:52,965
If we have any honor you will have the chastity

461
00:37:53,125 --> 00:37:56,125
but you are dishonoring yourself

462
00:37:56,285 --> 00:37:59,725
and you think you have been very very smart and modern

463
00:37:59,885 --> 00:38:05,565
by becoming so sinful.

464
00:38:05,725 --> 00:38:09,205
All the sinful act that is going on in these modern times

465
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:15,605
is absolutely wrong and it should be completely, we should abhor it.

466
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:19,245
You should go no way near because that’s all wrong

467
00:38:19,405 --> 00:38:22,925
and that’s how Shri Ganesha gets angry.

468
00:38:23,085 --> 00:38:27,005
Decency is very important in understanding,

469
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:33,165
what is our important basis, is our chastity.

470
00:38:33,325 --> 00:38:39,685
In India you know thirty two thousand women got themselves burnt

471
00:38:39,845 --> 00:38:43,925
for saving their chastity. I come from the same family

472
00:38:44,085 --> 00:38:47,845
and you can imagine what courage they must be having,

473
00:38:48,005 --> 00:38:52,243
what faith they must be having, in their chastity

474
00:38:52,403 --> 00:38:56,078
that if we lose our chastity what’s the use of our life.

475
00:38:56,238 --> 00:39:02,014
So they cared for their chastity, have done so much sacrifice

476
00:39:02,174 --> 00:39:06,565
to show that chastity is the most important thing, we all should have.

477
00:39:06,725 --> 00:39:11,468
Its not only for women but also for men, very much more for men.

478
00:39:11,628 --> 00:39:13,856
Shri Ganesha is very important thing

479
00:39:14,016 --> 00:39:16,478
because men can develop so many diseases

480
00:39:16,638 --> 00:39:20,286
if they do not respect Shri Ganesha.

481
00:39:21,127 --> 00:39:28,182
Our health would be the best if we look after Shri Ganesha

482
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:31,541
because he is all the time repairing our body.

483
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:35,386
He is all the time looking after, protecting us

484
00:39:35,546 --> 00:39:41,397
and our Shri Ganesha is in the Mooladhara.

485
00:39:41,557 --> 00:39:44,310
He is the one who is looking after our Kundalini,

486
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:46,845
he is protecting our Kundalini.

487
00:39:47,005 --> 00:39:53,584
If any thing happens to us the Kundalini comes up

488
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:59,342
but the one who supports her and, keeps her up,

489
00:39:59,502 --> 00:40:03,786
awakened and standing is Shri Ganesha. He works it out.

490
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:07,965
He is the one who is the protector of our Kundalini

491
00:40:08,125 --> 00:40:14,986
which is also a basis of your self realization.

492
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:18,584
So how much important is Shri Ganesha you should know,

493
00:40:18,744 --> 00:40:21,521
and you should find out about yourself,

494
00:40:21,681 --> 00:40:26,300
introspect that are we really dedicated to Shri Ganesha?

495
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,845
If we are; what are we doing about it?

496
00:40:29,005 --> 00:40:35,186
Then you will develop a real hatred for all these dirty things.

497
00:40:35,346 --> 00:40:38,108
You will not like them, will not like such people.

498
00:40:38,268 --> 00:40:41,390
That is how a Sahaja Yogi should work it out.

499
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:44,464
The children are the best as we know.

500
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:52,051
Children are so sweet and so kind, they are so loving, so beautiful.

501
00:40:52,211 --> 00:40:56,426
In the same way we should know Shri Ganesha is there.

502
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:59,921
He is the one who is really innocent

503
00:41:00,081 --> 00:41:04,329
but extremely, protective of you,

504
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:07,963
very much protective, with his innocence.

505
00:41:08,123 --> 00:41:10,699
So we should also try to cherish our innocence

506
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:14,605
and not to feel hurt because sometime such people are cheated,

507
00:41:14,765 --> 00:41:17,449
dominated, every thing happens, doesn’t matter.

508
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:20,899
They will all suffer who will dominate innocent people.

509
00:41:21,059 --> 00:41:26,120
As the whole world, you see, there is a big uproar about it,

510
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,445
people are talking about it that

511
00:41:28,605 --> 00:41:32,669
there should not be domination of the innocent simple people.

512
00:41:32,829 --> 00:41:36,024
It has happened but it all has to be changed,

513
00:41:36,184 --> 00:41:42,965
has to be brought to some last end otherwise people can not exist,

514
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:47,683
like everywhere they went and oppressed so many people.

515
00:41:47,843 --> 00:41:51,493
In America, I was surprised to see that

516
00:41:51,653 --> 00:41:54,405
there were so many Red Indians,

517
00:41:54,565 --> 00:41:58,405
who are called as Indian Americans.

518
00:41:58,565 --> 00:42:03,692
They were all oppressed so much that they had to run away

519
00:42:03,852 --> 00:42:08,003
to different places and then I went to this place Canajoharie.

520
00:42:08,163 --> 00:42:10,805
I found the vibrations were so good.

521
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:13,605
That means they were very innocent, simple people

522
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:16,784
and Americans that time, who went there,

523
00:42:16,944 --> 00:42:19,805
tried to completely finish them.

524
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:23,294
So they went and hid in places like Canajoharie

525
00:42:23,454 --> 00:42:27,045
but the Canajoharie has such tremendous vibrations

526
00:42:27,205 --> 00:42:30,055
that I said look at this, so many years have passed,

527
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,925
still the people who live there or worked about

528
00:42:34,085 --> 00:42:39,226
and were absolutely enjoying this place were Red Indians,

529
00:42:39,386 --> 00:42:43,959
the ones who were Indians, we call them American Indians.

530
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:46,294
But they are so simple and innocent

531
00:42:46,454 --> 00:42:49,405
and they were so, I think, spiritual people

532
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:52,205
because they used to worship the Mother.

533
00:42:52,365 --> 00:42:55,005
All the time they worship the Mother.

534
00:42:55,165 --> 00:42:58,765
Even I have seen in other countries it has happened

535
00:42:58,925 --> 00:43:04,025
but I was happy to see that in Australia they are very secular.

536
00:43:04,185 --> 00:43:06,985
They have many Maoris and all those people

537
00:43:07,145 --> 00:43:08,865
and they encourage all of them

538
00:43:09,025 --> 00:43:12,865
and its so surprising that they have so much talent

539
00:43:13,025 --> 00:43:20,108
and they are bringing them to this state to show

540
00:43:20,274 --> 00:43:24,981
that they are equal in their rights, political rights, in Australia.

541
00:43:25,141 --> 00:43:27,345
Its a very good venture.

542
00:43:27,505 --> 00:43:34,225
Now this Ganesha has appeared in Australia is as Uluru,

543
00:43:34,385 --> 00:43:39,044
is a very big mountain which looks like Shri Ganesha.

544
00:43:39,204 --> 00:43:44,123
It has also a very big trunk, going down.

545
00:43:44,283 --> 00:43:48,385
Vibrations itself will prove that it is Shri Ganesha,

546
00:43:48,545 --> 00:43:49,785
from the mother earth.

547
00:43:49,945 --> 00:43:53,705
He has appeared in many places, Shri Ganesha not only there.

548
00:43:53,865 --> 00:44:01,025
But there I felt is really the source, source of vibrations.

549
00:44:01,185 --> 00:44:02,821
That’s what it is.

550
00:44:02,981 --> 00:44:07,661
And in Australia I thank him that because of him only

551
00:44:07,821 --> 00:44:11,385
Sahaja Yoga has worked so well and so easily,

552
00:44:11,545 --> 00:44:13,886
and Government also has never troubled us

553
00:44:14,046 --> 00:44:16,501
or there has been no problem with them.

554
00:44:16,661 --> 00:44:19,206
I don’t know what’s this helping them

555
00:44:19,366 --> 00:44:23,726
but perhaps it is Shri Ganesha as Uluru

556
00:44:23,886 --> 00:44:28,175
which is protecting Sahaja Yoga there and is growing so much.

557
00:44:28,335 --> 00:44:32,226
In the same way every where, wherever you may be

558
00:44:32,386 --> 00:44:34,476
Shri Ganesha should be worshipped

559
00:44:34,636 --> 00:44:38,880
and you will be helped out and out miraculously.

560
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,164
You will be helped, miraculously

561
00:44:41,324 --> 00:44:46,535
but first do something about our chastity which is Shri Ganesha.

562
00:44:46,733 --> 00:44:48,558
May God Bless You.
