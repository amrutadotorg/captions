What do you say, he is better.

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:02.760

It's all right, could be corrected.

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.120
They are giving you some ideas against Me. Are they?

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:41.640

Once you becomes the spirit, you are the guru.

00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:06.480
You got the absolute, why should you have the guru?

00:23:13.760 --> 00:23:17.480
All right, better now. Y: hot.  SM, Hot, left side.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:20.000
Y: More, more is there on left side.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:22.360
You put your right hand like this, like this ya.

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.040
It's ventilating you see.

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:28.960
What about him, let him also put his right hand like this.

00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.520
Now who else is the new person here

00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:35.120
Isle, is this gentleman, what you we say?

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:40.880
He's from New York.Y: Australia.

00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:52.880

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.880
All various things.

00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:04.520
No one.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:08.360
But you have read books, something.

00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.320
And spiritualists  ESPs.

00:24:17.600 --> 00:24:18.800
Parapsychology?

00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.680
Anything like that, parapsychology, psychology also.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.640
Yogi: years ago, ten years ago. SM, Which where did you go.

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.960
Ten years ago, where did you go?

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.240
I I just read, just read.

00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:41.200
Just read, Yogi: Yes. Mother, About?

00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:43.480
Parapsychology.

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.600
No no, what was the thing you read? Just we want to know that.

00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:56.080
It will be better, it will help us.

00:24:57.800 --> 00:25:00.920
If you can remember something.

00:25:07.560 --> 00:25:08.720
carnesis.

00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.560
Y: Carnesis Mother. who is that one.

00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.760
Moving objects.

00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:22.720
With your mic.

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:26.480
Give him a bandhan.

00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:06.840
There is liver, his left side very caught up.

00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:21.480
Did you do Siddha course and all that?

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.480
Siddha course and all that you did.

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:28.200
Y:(...) You did? From where?

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:32.080
Which? where? Did you go to Scotland For that?

00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:33.800
Yogi: No in england.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:34.920
In England, where?

00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:40.240
In London, in ..... Where? Y: London.

00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.440
Y: I did it in London and also did ...

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.240
What?

00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:57.640
The name of the company in L....

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.400
SM: Poor thing. Y:(...)

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:07.200
We have a deputy director, Who, What is that?

00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.480
What is he talking about?

00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:19.240
Aah..Y:(...) SM: Poor thing.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:22.520
They have really.

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:29.680
Y: The flying technique ....

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.880
I have done the flying but could never fly.

00:27:39.280 --> 00:27:41.600
He was in charge of that , this one is sitting here.

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:44.680
He was in charge in Scott land.

00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:48.480
No its wrong,It's nonsense, It's not true.

00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.560
Y: I comes true, how did I swollen myself.

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.440
They were doing practicing of same techniques

00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:56.480
which I was but I didn't fly but they did.

00:27:56.840 --> 00:27:59.040
So they were just jumping like you can jump on a horse.

00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:01.280
I saw them going up.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:04.120
No. Can not.Y: (...)

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.320
It's only mesmerism.

00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.280
With that one can see anything, one feel like, but I

00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:13.200
Y: (...)

00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.360
They were not going up, you see what happens that

00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:19.440
They have foreman all that , they were made to jump and jump jump

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.600
So you develop a kind of a ...

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.080
They they were sitting, they couldn't jump.

00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:33.040
See the gentleman who was doing this, teaching this is here.

00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.880
Flying technique, and he end up with

00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.320
nothing but epilepsy

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:43.960
We have to recognise him

00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:47.120
He was deputy director of the technique.

00:28:48.320 --> 00:28:49.640
And it was all falls.

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.840
Y: But I don't see it.

00:28:56.560 --> 00:28:58.920
You see what happens that they are spirits.

00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.120
and they just give you a sought of a jump.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.680
That's all, we have people they came for My program

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.440
and suddenly they started jumping.Now I said,This is too much.

00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:11.440
Because you see everybody started running up.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.440
from that mad crowd.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:14.600
We had a Ashram.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:18.200
There they came just screaming you see, even looking at Me

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:20.920
They would just jump from here to there.

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.160
And screaming and shouting, you see there are people,

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.120
nearby said, we can't have this Ashram

00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.680
Some sought of a black magic is going on.

00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:31.920
They brought such a bad name poor.

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.240
See My point.

00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.960
Is not jumping, it's just a spirit that

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:38.400
throws you off for while, that's not jumping.

00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.640
That's what, what you call.

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:43.240
Beg a pardon, You this approve this.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.520
Now you just tell Me, you are a reasonable man

00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:53.240
How can I approve of such a non sense as that.

00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.480
We are going to become birds now or something high.

00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.400
Do you understand?

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:01.800
Not only disapprove but condemn it.

00:30:03.080 --> 00:30:05.320
Horrible thing they have done, money making proposition.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.960
And be fool.Y: Money making.SM: and be fooling, both thing.

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.760
How much money this man has made, do you know?

00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.160
You are too simple and naive to understand

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.960
And the treachery.... of these people.

00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.640
It's all money making.

00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.880
Simple as that and be fooled.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:32.360
Don't get upset but it is.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.640
Absolutely that.

00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:39.280
You reach no where, it's all telling lies.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.040
One after another,

00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:43.560
The director, who was here, now he has gone to Africa,

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:45.760
he told Me, not this, this is deputy director.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.960
The director was another fellow.

00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.560
And his wife is here out, so she has come?

00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:54.400
Linda. she isn't come today, all right.

00:30:55.520 --> 00:30:57.080
You should meet them and they will tell you all the stories,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.080
what there, they have been there, they are in charge

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.760
I mean, He was the one, who was running the academy.

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:04.760
His wife and he use to tell people

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:06.000
that I walk through the walls

00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:08.480
I said, "But why did you say such a thing?

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:15.280
Also that technique suitable for bare player.

00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:20.840
But that technique doesn't work out, it's falls hood.

00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:22.480
What I am trying to tell you,

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.240
I said, "Why did you tell them lies?They were asked to tell.

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.400
They said, "Unless and until you tell the people,

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:30.040
The people are not going to believe you and this won't run.

00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:32.560
Big money was involves of this man.

00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:35.720
So he started telling lies and he confessed it.

00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.680
Absolutely

00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.680
Y: Who is the in charge now? SM: is now Peter Peers.

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.640
And his wife is still there in England.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.360
I thing, she will come some, you will meet her some time.

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:48.640
All right, So you meet them and they will tell you all the,

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.920
They will tell you all the tricks, what they were trying to do.

00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:52.840
These are all the tricks.

00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.200
Now you want the real or not.

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.840
Or some tricks like that.

00:31:57.360 --> 00:32:02.240
Y: What are the is like here before hearing what they did.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:05.400
The way they charged money and all and

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:09.040
they deny to people who do enough for,

00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.960
You see, that is one of the thing one should think.

00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:14.360
always that you can't play for God.

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.040
If it is your ascent in spirituality

00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.680
It is a natural thing spontaneous.

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.480
It's within you, and you can't pay for God.

00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:26.800
But you see, People and human being can't understand God.

00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:30.080
It's beyond them to see this point

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.120
because they have seen Churches taking money,

00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.680
temples taking money, everybody taking money,

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.680
When they think these are another type, you see

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:40.120
But if you have to have an alternative for that

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.120
that should be at least

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.240
Free for you, it should be free for everyone.

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:47.960
That's not the only point,

00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.960
it's much worse then that you will know that.

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:52.760
On top of your head,

00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:55.080
just to, no no, on top of your head, all right

00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:58.320
tap it on. on top of your head.

00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.560
Just on your Sahasrara, Yes yes, just in front.

00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:05.240
It seems to be cool.

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.120
And look at your own condition

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:16.280
You see the, you should see the people, how they have become.

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:23.200
Just put it on his head, little bit,

00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.920
little bit with your own hand.

00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:26.680
Will be better

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:30.680
Just or let him do himself.

00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:32.800
Little bit,

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:35.960
already he has got cold, or let him drink that water.

00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:39.320
Water would be better, he is all void caught up,

00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.960
his left side caught up, he is very very left sided

00:33:47.880 --> 00:33:49.160
It's going to take time to get all right,

00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:51.200
All right, if you want you can drink it.

00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:58.320
Now it's better, better?

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.960
Burning is there but the rest is all right.

00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.560
They take advantage

00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.280
For icing now you just mix it up in there, little bit in that oil.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.040
Y: (...) SM: that is, all that,

00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.720
..with your finger.

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:48.960
Y: (...)

00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.960
They don't dissolve and it should become powder.

00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.880
They are becoming. Y: Yes.

00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:10.840
Yes, better now, how is he, Is he better now?

00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:13.960
Just very very hot in the left.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:17.160
Poor thing. Walter, where has he been?

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:18.920
He has been to everywhere.

00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.320
No wonder.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.640
Is he all right tor he has some problem.

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:37.160
Natural .....super natural

00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:42.400
Super natural and ES ESP astrology.

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:53.040
I mean whats the use of super natural

00:35:53.640 --> 00:35:55.680
that we can't even keep good health, minimum.

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.560
You see we should ask ourselves a question.

00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.720
At least our health should be all right, it's all right now.

00:36:04.760 --> 00:36:06.480
It's better, keep him his eyes open.

00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.160
You see getting vibrations on top of his head.

00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:14.040
We can move right to the left.

00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:17.320
He is all right. Are you all right now?

00:36:17.640 --> 00:36:20.760
Are you feeling cool breeze in the hand or not?

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.880
Now keep it up, you are all right. Give him a bandhan.

00:36:38.680 --> 00:36:40.960
So twenty one years of this so what is your age now.

00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:45.160

00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.560
My age has a secret.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.760
Secret? For What?

00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:52.720
I don't wa..a

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.760
I have ... to keep my age secret.

00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:58.800
All right.Y:(...)

00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.440
No it's all right, whatever you say.

00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.480
Because that's why I was thinking you were worried about time, why?

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:10.280
I found that to play this (mahari)

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.000
she's program takes  an awful lot of time

00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:14.760
But no one has gained anything.

00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:17.480
Y:, I beg a pardon. SM, But nobody has gained anything.

00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:22.080
Y: (...)

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.720
That's how they propagate.

00:37:25.960 --> 00:37:27.520
They have a very good propaganda.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:30.280
But they are caught up some times.

00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:33.000
One day they were saying that

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:36.360
they tried to take the X-ray of  people

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.800
of the brain and they found

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.640
there are theta rays coming out of it.

00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.800
So one of the Doctor who was there

00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:46.040
was a Sahaja Yogi, he caught up and he said,

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:49.120
Theta rays only shows that the person is epileptic.

00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:51.760
and they did not know, where to look?

00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:53.760
Really what they gave you epilepsy.

00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.440
That's the only thing, you end up with epilepsy.

00:37:58.320 --> 00:37:59.240
That's the end of TM.

00:38:03.520 --> 00:38:05.720
It's good, I must say but he is a great seeker.

00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:09.360
All right, now put your hand, now one thing is

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.240
that TM people ask too many questions and they take time.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:14.160
So just don't ask any question.

00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.240
First your realization, all right.

00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:19.320
Put some TM with him, that’s better.

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.080
Will you look after him? All right, come along.

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.720
you come this side, he will look after you, the deputy director.

00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:32.680
How is now? Ya, just come here.

00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:36.800
It's better that you you you stay with him.

00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:38.160
I mean you understand him,

00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:40.360
he will tell you better, he knows all things,

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.920
he has gone through. Can you ask?

00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:51.240
All right, now what you do is ask

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.120
this gentleman and that gentleman to put it here into, on this.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.280
into Yes, they have got all.

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:01.520
Y: (...) SM:, on to.

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:04.880
This spot, You can use this and put it here, just put it here.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.440
Not with your finger, Vishuddhi finger, Yes.

00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:13.120
Just there, May be it might  have.

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.320
Let's see, left Agnya.

00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.600
Now take a candle for him.

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:30.840
You can take him that side and work it out.You see better.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.440
Can you come this side a little bit please?

00:39:34.640 --> 00:39:36.080
Can you get up and sit on this side?

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:38.520
If he could  move a little bit this side then?

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.400
He can work out on both of them.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:43.800
Now , are you better now?

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:48.840
You are better now,You are feeling the cool breeze. Not yet.

00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:56.160
It's had the void, still.

00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.640
you say the mantras of the void and he will be all right. sit down.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.880
I  think yes most of them wanted, little bit.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:09.600
You see in Sahaja Yoga you are not given any mantra or anything.

00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:13.480
There is no, nothing like giving you into a big course.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:16.120
Like teaching you one after another any mantra or anything.

00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:17.840
It's not like this.

00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:21.400
What you have to know, where the Kundalini is, how it is moving?

00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.160
Where it is ? What is the Chakra catching?

00:40:24.680 --> 00:40:26.080
and what is the mantra for that?

00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.520
It doesn’t take anything, hardly takes about a week.

00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.560
For you to understand the whole thing.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.240
But gradually as you start moving it, you become proficient.

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.120
Then you can know, how to do it for yourself and for others.

00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:39.960
There is not much of a thing like a child,

00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.120
When he comes up a little age,

00:40:43.160 --> 00:40:44.480
It starts picking up language.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.920
Because he has built in capacity,

00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.800
to create sound.

00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.080
And he does it, in the same way,

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:52.440
Once you get it,

00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.120
when you get the cool breeze in your hand,

00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:56.960
you learn it by using it.

00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.200
You understand it, your self.

00:40:59.400 --> 00:41:03.000
You become yourself quite proficient

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:05.360
And you will be amazed, how fast you learn this.

00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.440
You don't have to learn it just like a

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:09.840
Science book or anything.

00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.320
Just start learning with

00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:12.840
This is the Chakra, it is catching, because now,

00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.880
for example this Chakra is catching.

00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.040
Right side, Now there is a mantra for this is of Shri Krishna.

00:41:19.560 --> 00:41:20.720
Say this Chakra is catching,

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:24.360
Here, then this the Mantra for Jesses Christ.

00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:27.160
Like that you must know,

00:41:27.400 --> 00:41:28.840
the Mantra's and the Chakras.

00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.400
But the Chakras you just know

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.920
as a absolutely a knowledge.

00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:35.840
Which is built in your nerves.

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.560
Just feel it,

00:41:38.200 --> 00:41:40.360
This is, now this gentleman is saying it's hot here.

00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:42.880
All right, what is that, hot here means what?

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.280
That the Sahasrara, at the left side.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:47.440
First it was the Sahasrara on the right.

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:49.360
Now on the left side,

00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.920
So that means, there is a Mantra for that,

00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400
and that one must be used.

00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:55.360
If you use that this will be cleared.

00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:59.720
All right, that is how you have to know.

00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:01.120
And that's why I said,

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:03.200
it takes time for people, sometimes.

00:42:03.920 --> 00:42:05.880
They establish because first you have to know it

00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:07.080
and then use it.

00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:10.880
Come along, are you come for the first time?

00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.920
All right, come along, come along this side.

00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.120
So it is not a difficult thing.

00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:22.920
It is not at all a difficult thing to learn it.

00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:25.280
It's very easy, you can pick it up in no time.

00:42:25.640 --> 00:42:28.080
As soon as you start using your hands on other people.

00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:30.000
Please be seated.

00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.880
Just see them some people come along.

00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200
Now these people say,

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.040
Who are the latest who have come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:41.560 --> 00:42:42.560
Let's say, the latest one.

00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:48.120
Say those who have come about a month back.

00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:53.520
Se he came back, she came back only one month.

00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:59.600
And, Y: This is the Sahasrara ...

00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:04.640
Monday. all right, he's got, but you see.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:06.840
Have you been giving vibrations now?

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.760
In one month, it starts, so you can imagine.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:16.040
And you know about the Chakras now.

00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:18.560
About the Mantras.

00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.440
Yes, see that's,  it's very simple.

00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:29.400
If you pay attention to it, you can do it much faster.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:32.560
There are many people who are here.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.280
With in a month one, one's style.

00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:36.160
They picked up so many things,

00:43:37.760 --> 00:43:40.000
many, within one month's time.

00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:46.320
It's all right, because you becomes the knowledge.

00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:48.640
You start feeling it one your fingers.

00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:49.960
Unless you know, this is the Chakra,

00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:51.960
If this finger is, say burning,

00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.960
that means your left heart is catching.

00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:55.880
If your left heart is catching

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.640
then you know then you know, because it's burning.

00:43:58.160 --> 00:43:59.160
There is nothing to go to the books or anything.

00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.120
anything to find out, the burning is there.

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.560
Isn't it, that is the left heart is catching.

00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:05.600
Now only you have to know,

00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.240
While, when Left heart is catching,

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:09.240
the decoding only, what does that mean?

00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:12.840
Your hands will speak, Christ has said. All right.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:14.960
They will speak, I am just decoding.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.160
Now you see for yourself, if it is true or not.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.800
What does that mean?

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:21.240
Left heart means, there is a problem on the heart.

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.960
May be the person is over hard working.

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:26.800
He has forgotten about the spirit.

00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:30.720
The Mantra is, you have to say I am the spirit.

00:44:33.200 --> 00:44:34.280
It's so simple.

00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.840
Because you have forgotten about your spirit.

00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.560
You are on the right side,

00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.360
in the sense you are more extro..

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:44.880
You are an extrovert.

00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:46.560
And more attention is outside.

00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:49.440
Not towards is your spirit, left heart is catching.

00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:54.480
You start understanding Sahaja Yoga so well.

00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.720
When your vibrations are sturdy.

00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:01.240
Now this finger this is catching.

00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.280
Now this is catching means

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.000
The person has been to somebody

00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:08.520
Who is an unauthorized in Spiritual life.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.960
Any thing say, ESP

00:45:11.600 --> 00:45:13.280
you call it EST, then you have got

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.000
but parapsychology, even psychology.

00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:18.000
Then you have other thing like all these guru.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.760
Fall gurus, then can say this aura business.

00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.680
What else is there, just now he was telling.

00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:26.320
Super natural and

00:45:26.920 --> 00:45:28.480
under natural and

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.160
all these things, you know.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.720
all alternative we can think of.

00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:36.360
Anything, you can think of all these things.

00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.240
And the books and the Lama and the Dhama' and everything.

00:45:42.480 --> 00:45:44.160
Even people who go, a sought of

00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.280
adhere to Church too much.

00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:48.480
or adhere to Catholicism.

00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:51.240
Because they are not connected with God

00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:52.680
and they are unauthorized.

00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.960
But if you have been to real guru,

00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.600
then immediately I will know.

00:45:57.840 --> 00:45:59.920
You won't have this problem and ascent will be fast.

00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:00.920
If you have been to real guru.

00:46:01.520 --> 00:46:02.640
But how many are real these days.

00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:06.080
In the market only those who are marketing guard there as it is.

00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.800
In the market only the buyers and the shop keepers.

00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:11.920
It's a market place now.

00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.680
So the real guru's are not to be seen.

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.760
There are of course I know, there are many real gurus also.

00:46:19.800 --> 00:46:20.560
But where ever they are

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:23.840
They are not in the market, I am the only person fighting them,

00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:25.520
And tell them off, you see,

00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:28.600
None of them are willing to come down or to conceive to anything

00:46:29.120 --> 00:46:30.560
they are saying these human beings are hopeless.

00:46:31.680 --> 00:46:33.800
They say twelve year you work Mother then we come down.

00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:35.760
They want Me alone to fight the thing.

00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:38.480
Poor thing, doesn't matter, so now,

00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.360
It's a market place, there are buyer.

00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.280
There simple naive customers.

00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:47.600
They just put such absurd things like

00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:51.360
somebody says alright, I want to sell

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:55.960
a big palace with this and that

00:46:56.440 --> 00:47:00.120
and all that. Only you have to deposit two thousand pounds.

00:47:00.600 --> 00:47:02.720
All right, people will be quite willing,

00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:05.680
Oh what a bargain? That's big, two thousand

00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:07.960
And the palace may belong to the Queen.

00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:11.400
If you go there and ask them, Which palace.

00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:12.920
Palace wants to say that this is the palace,

00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.920
and that belongs to the Queen.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:17.280
This is unauthorized.

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.440
Unauthorized people

00:47:21.280 --> 00:47:22.560
Who have nothing to do with God.

00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:24.960
Who claim that they have something to do with.

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:26.800
With God is falls.

00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:29.320
And that's why they catch on this finger.

00:47:30.360 --> 00:47:33.400
And what do they do, they use all these techniques.

00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:38.040
This techniques are called in Sanskrit language as Avidya.

00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.480
Avidya means, non knowledge.

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.600
You can say that is not knowledge.

00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.360
something anti knowledge, anti God.

00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.760
This is anti God, so for that,

00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:51.800
the mantra is Shuddha Vidya,

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.240
means the pure technique

00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.120
is the Mantra. Pure technique is the  Mantra. Pure!

00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:05.360
means, the one that comes from the spirit.

00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.520
Now, what they are doing is the pure technique

00:48:08.920 --> 00:48:10.560
because it is flowing in that.

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:12.760
If they are moving their hand, there is a power flowing,

00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.240
through them and they are working it out.

00:48:15.120 --> 00:48:18.520
It's not just a acrobatic thing, that's going on.

00:48:19.560 --> 00:48:22.440
So  the pure knowledge, for example, the way they are raising

00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.960
is can......now in My presence.

00:48:25.520 --> 00:48:27.800
And they themselves are realized souls, it's working out.

00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:31.680
So this all, is the pure Vidya.

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:34.280
is the pure knowledge and pure technique.

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.120
And those who have not done this

00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.720
have gone to such people

00:48:39.480 --> 00:48:41.840
Put their head before them, kneel before them

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:45.360
have done something, which should not have been done.

00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:49.240
So this is it, and that's how you catch on this.

00:48:49.880 --> 00:48:51.480
Thumb, left hand, that's means

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:53.440
a person has been to somebody like this.

00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:56.920
But with that if you have any catch on this void

00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:58.880
or this void here in the stomach one,

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:02.120
This is left Swadishthana, this placed here down below.

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:04.520
Which moves like that all over here,

00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:06.440
and this becomes right Swadisthana this.

00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.400
Now, supposing a person catches all around here,

00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:12.400
this Void and all around here.

00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.160
is called as the Void, We call it Void.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:17.560
Its not the Zen Void.

00:49:18.080 --> 00:49:19.680
But the Void is the crossing point,

00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.520
which is the Viscera, the stomach point

00:49:24.320 --> 00:49:27.800
where abdomen, you can abdomen

00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:32.120
and this part, if it is catching,that means, these are

00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:37.520
The ten Principles of the guru.

00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.440
If this is catching means,

00:49:40.880 --> 00:49:44.000
you have hurt, your principle of guru.your guru.

00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:46.920
Principle of a master.

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.120
That means you have gone to some very wrong man.

00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:53.000
If this is catching, that means that now

00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:55.120
Just now as they say, his Void is catching.

00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.280
The Kundalini will be wobbling there.

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.560
You can see with your own eyes also.

00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.600
You can see the Kundalini just,

00:50:01.040 --> 00:50:03.600
poor things pulsating there, you can see

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:05.200
the whole stomach going into trauma.

00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:09.320
and then you have to say the Mantra

00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:12.760
of the Primordial Master, anyone you can do it, you see.

00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.800
Guru Nanaka's name you can take.

00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.240
Mohammad's name you can take.

00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:18.760
All of them are Prophets, Moses name, Abraham

00:50:19.440 --> 00:50:21.440
All these are there, so if you take their name,

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.480
The Kundalini can be brought up.

00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.120
You can strengthen that part.

00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:27.760
Then the Kundalini is pushed up.

00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:31.400
So all these so called yoga's

00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.440
also like physical yoga.

00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:36.440
Now in the physical yoga, you will catch

00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:39.600
catch this finger(right Agaya) and this finger(left heart)

00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:44.760
This ring finger and this finger.

00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.960
This is heart,

00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:50.080
means you are paying too much attention to your physical thing.

00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:53.640
Anybody who is working is too much physically can catch this.

00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.640
Plus this (left Swadishthana)

00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.320
because when you go into action too much also,

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:01.800
as a result of that fume of your actions

00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:02.960
create your ego.

00:51:03.760 --> 00:51:05.680
This is one of the biggest problem of the West.

00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.400
You see, they are not aware of that they have ego.

00:51:08.280 --> 00:51:10.880
But after realization they start seeing the balloon bloating.

00:51:11.400 --> 00:51:13.400
They see and then come and tell Me.

00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:15.560
Mother I am catching on my right Agaya,

00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:18.120
It's a very delicate stuff,

00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.560
you can't tell anybody

00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.520
you have got ego, though you will have it.

00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:24.040
So you have to be very careful, when you are talking.

00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:28.840
But actually so many people felt there is ego in them.

00:51:29.440 --> 00:51:30.800
So they took to,even people

00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.320
When they feel they have too much ego,

00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:33.600
they will take to alcoholism.

00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:34.880
Because they are frighten of themselves,

00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.720
they can't just bear them,they want to escape that.

00:51:37.480 --> 00:51:38.960
So people are quite conscious.

00:51:39.320 --> 00:51:41.400
But after realization  it becomes a

00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.440
complete understanding

00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.480
Because you start feeling a little pain sometime.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:48.120
in this finger,and you feel a pain here.

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:50.960
and you know that you got this mystery, which is just coming up.

00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:53.560
So then you know that how to twist it and take it out.

00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.440
How to bring it out.

00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.920
So you start understanding yourself and you start understanding.

00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:03.520
I don't have to tell, you know yourself.

00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:10.040
Now we have certain things like we use vibrated water.

00:52:10.880 --> 00:52:13.520
For clearing your void, now what is vibrated water?

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.960
Water is nothing that but divine vibrations are put in.

00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:21.400
And they go and start bombarding

00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.000
that area and try to improve.

00:52:24.440 --> 00:52:27.440
We have cured so many people of stomach cancer and all those.

00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:30.240
Even we can cure

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.880
What you call blood cancer and things in Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:34.920
So many have been cured, you can cure.

00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:38.120
You can do. No problem, you can do.

00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:41.120
But what one has to do, to be steadily

00:52:42.480 --> 00:52:44.520
mo0ving about in SahajaYoga, not for example.

00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:47.960
You have a conception about Christ. Say for example.

00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:51.480
Now that conception may not be the real conception of Christ.

00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.640
May not be or may be so keep your eyes open.

00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.320
Now what I say in Sahaja Yoga, you can verify.

00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:02.000
But do not deny, first verify supposing you go as a

00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:04.960
Scientist, you have to go and see for yourself.

00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.920
Isn't it, you just don't deny at the gate door,

00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.000
this cannot be done not be true because whatever you know

00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:13.440
is your own conception, get inside, all right.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:17.640
Now when you get inside keep your  eyes open and see for yourself.

00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:23.800
And then once you start seeing it.

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:26.280
That's the best way is knowing because

00:53:26.680 --> 00:53:28.680
what you see is through your vibratory awareness.

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.480
For example now I want to ask you a question.

00:53:32.200 --> 00:53:35.320
say, Mother is the their God.

00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.560
Just ask Me question thrice

00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:42.920
and you will find the vibration will increase,it's a fact.

00:53:44.880 --> 00:53:47.040
But if you ask about TM, you may start burning.

00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:51.080
vibrations will stop, better ask about God,

00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.840
so that we have vibrations.

00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:58.680
Relatively you can understand it first.

00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:02.520
like we had people there in Pune

00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.600
and we had organized a program

00:54:05.720 --> 00:54:07.520
and they announced it in the paper

00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:10.480
and they suddenly discovered that I am not a Brahmin.

00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:12.080
and they got very upset

00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.600
and they said, you are not a Brahmin, I mean born Brahmin,

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.840
I mean, according to them, you can be realized soul born.

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.480
How can you be, You can be.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.800
But every Brahmin not a realized soul at all.

00:54:21.160 --> 00:54:22.840
on the contrary some are real devils.

00:54:24.040 --> 00:54:26.880
and so they wanted to cancel My program.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:28.800
I didn't know all this, nobody told Me,

00:54:29.480 --> 00:54:31.080
But then they said if you would canceled this now,

00:54:31.560 --> 00:54:33.400
It's out in the paper, everybody will know that you are,

00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.400
a sought of of a...

00:54:37.200 --> 00:54:38.120
Brahminic society.

00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.800
Which is very dangerous in India. You are a secular state.

00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.720
Say, we are also secular state.

00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.600
Can not proclaim that we are a Brahmanic society and all that.

00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:49.760
As we people cannot proclaim that we are racialist

00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:50.760
in the same way,

00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:56.920
I mean, under law you cannot, but I mean people can be, so

00:54:57.960 --> 00:54:59.480
When you see, I was

00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:04.480
They were meditating all of them, I gave a lecture there.

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:06.960
then these people, who were sitting there

00:55:07.360 --> 00:55:09.200
in front of Me started shaking like this.

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.360
So I said, "Now why are you shaking?

00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.720
They couldn't control themselves

00:55:13.200 --> 00:55:14.280
Why are you shaking, so what?

00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:16.600
So they said, Mother because you are the Shakti.

00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:18.560
You are the power, that's why we are shaking.

00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.560
I said, " Not that, others are not shaking, why are you shaking?

00:55:22.440 --> 00:55:24.840
They said we are very powerful that’s why we have special energies.

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:28.960
and see these are shaking, this side.

00:55:29.800 --> 00:55:31.080
I said, " Just go and ask, from where do they come.

00:55:31.920 --> 00:55:33.440
and they all have come from Lunatic Asylum.

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:36.960
Those who are shaking, so I said, now you understand.

00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:40.600
Why they are shaking haven, so they said,you mean say

00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:44.000
, we are lunatic, I said," You are fanatic if not lunatic"

00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:48.840
You see, so, then they started

00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.160
now they are very great disciple of out’s.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.520
in the sense they are Sahaja Yogis

00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.960
They  have got all the things  done  for us, they have given up

00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:59.080
that Brahmanic ideas, their fanaticism, but

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.600
A sought of thing you will see yourself, what I am saying.

00:56:03.800 --> 00:56:05.360
Now keep your brains intact,

00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.880
don;t give away to anything.

00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:09.360
Your brains are very important.

00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:14.600
They understand thing and you can see things clearly

00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.360
what's happening, keep your alertness

00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:19.320
and see for yourself whats happening

00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:23.360
But supposing if you use your brain all the time criticizing

00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:26.000
because people who go to various things, say for a person

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:28.080
who goes to this, fat fellow,

00:56:28.520 --> 00:56:30.600
who has taken fifty nine Rolls Royces now

00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:32.400
They never question him,

00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:34.640
They never asked him a question

00:56:35.320 --> 00:56:36.760
Why do you need Rolls Royce?

00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.760
when he sent about fifty lakhs, they starve themselves and sent,

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:42.800
They never questioned him.

00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.200
But to Me, when they come, they will question ten times.

00:56:47.680 --> 00:56:48.960
Why this, because you are free, I am happy,

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.520
you are free to question.

00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.760
But too much questioning is not good, it doesn't help you.

00:56:54.320 --> 00:56:56.720
Because I am not here for any Business.

00:56:58.800 --> 00:57:01.280
No business is involved, so they asked,

00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:03.120
question and questions and questions

00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:04.760
about this gentleman

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:08.440
who has taken Rolls Royces after Rolls Royces

00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.760
Can you imagine.?

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.960
English young people, can they afford all this?

00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:13.720
In one year they had to give,

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.520
one another Rolls Royce to him.

00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:18.960
Fifty nine thousand but, when they came from.

00:57:20.840 --> 00:57:22.560
Where he said," You must surrender yourself to me,

00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.680
you must do this, you must do that.

00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:25.920
They came here and we said

00:57:26.440 --> 00:57:27.960
that you are not to think too much.

00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:31.720
Immediately that whole ego, that was suppressed came upon.

00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.160
They said, "Oh you are doing the same thing to us.

00:57:35.720 --> 00:57:37.520
But I said, For what I don't want any Rolls Royce?

00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.200
Not even a bit of it.

00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:43.160
So why should I do it,

00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.680
The whole ego that was suppressed, you see.

00:57:47.320 --> 00:57:48.960
They were all mad after him

00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.160
One girl went to India.

00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.800
She use to wash his bathroom.

00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:58.640
with her tears, and clean with her hair.

00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.200
Can you believe?

00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:02.920
Just imagine!

00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:09.720
Not only one but all kinds of things they use to do with.

00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:13.000
and that one was, they were doing service to them.

00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.960
Their guru, this that, that was all right.

00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:17.440
Quite convinced, but when they came to Me

00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:19.880
They wasted all their energy in arguing with Me.

00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.440
And they started thinking,they are great SahajaYogis.

00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:24.160
They have to organize everything.

00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:26.160
They have to do this, they have to do that.

00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:28.040
So very difficult situation.

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:33.400
It happens with so many of them, one girl came to stay with Me

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:36.280
In Oxstead, where I was living, in My own house.

00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:38.920
Off she stayed, imagine, no payment, nothing

00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:44.360
and so argumentative, she ate My head off, I was fed up.

00:58:45.400 --> 00:58:47.480
I told her, I am sorry, I can't give you realization any more,

00:58:47.920 --> 00:58:49.920
because you are only interested in pestering Me.

00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.560
And had no patient, because I had to do something important.

00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:56.240
She became so important

00:58:57.080 --> 00:58:58.000
I asked her, "By the way tell Me,

00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.720
how to develop this ego, from where?

00:59:00.680 --> 00:59:02.920
She said, "I have no ego, I have surrendered it.

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:06.120
I said,"To whom?" She said, " She said we had a lama."

00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:08.680
Lama, from Tibet.

00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.600
And he sent a words, saying,

00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:13.120
that unless and until you have the flooring

00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:15.440
Marble flooring, I will not come.

00:59:17.600 --> 00:59:19.920
So poor thing, they starve themselves made marvel flooring

00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:23.000
for these parasites, they came down here.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.440
They never made any money, they never worked.

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:28.000
You see these Lamas, useless people,

00:59:28.800 --> 00:59:33.400
came down there and what was, they were told for one year,

00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.680
they have to do only one sadhu, one prat ice.

00:59:37.400 --> 00:59:38.320
They use to bow before

00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.200
that horrible Lama, for 1001 times.

00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.400
And they did it, after that.

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:47.600
Then she came to Me, naturally the whole ego that was

00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.560
oppress with in just came on Me.

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:53.480
I am sorry, I couldn't give her realization, I must say.

00:59:55.240 --> 00:59:58.840
couldn't, and I don't know, she is lost or what has happened.

00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:03.120
But this is what it is, that this kind of things can happen there,

01:00:03.600 --> 01:00:05.800
there are problems because of this wrong doings.

01:00:06.560 --> 01:00:10.160
They all leave very deep dents within us.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:12.800
So we must know that we have to get it all right.

01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:16.640
We have to be concern about ourselves because we are seekers.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:18.720
I have come here for yourself.

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.480
and the seeking has to be done, perfected

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.360
and we have to look after ourselves, we must love ourselves.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.040
and we must have self esteem.

01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:29.760
I say this, you should not have diffidence.

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:32.160
Oh God we have done all these things so whats going to happen

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.320
So you must have complete confidence, all right, first thing.

01:00:37.320 --> 01:00:39.320
And second thing, you must know that these were wrong thing.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:40.960
We are not going to do any more.

01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:43.240
and we are going to be all right

01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:45.560
so compromise yourself with yourself.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.320
Don't struggle with yourself, it is important.

01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:51.920
Because if you struggle with yourself, how are we to manage

01:00:53.240 --> 01:00:55.760
There will be a big tussle going on within you.

01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.560
So better compromise,

01:00:58.080 --> 01:00:59.920
that you are seekers and you must get realization

01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.520
There is very easy to make out a person, who is ego oriented.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.960
For us, it may not be for you, but we never say that.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:10.280
First of all your attention should be one one side.

01:01:10.680 --> 01:01:12.160
If it is moving too much, then be careful.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.040
Don't move your attention too much.

01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.920
Doesn't work out, attention has to be on one side.

01:01:18.520 --> 01:01:20.720
and try to put your attention one side, that's very important.

01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.040
If your all attention is moving here and there,

01:01:23.560 --> 01:01:24.400
that's our habit, you see

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:27.160
Somebody comes in, we must see, somebody goes out we must see.

01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:28.320
What's the need?

01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.960
Even the smallest thing happens, people will turn their eyes.

01:01:31.600 --> 01:01:33.840
Try to put your eyes  in proper attention.

01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:37.400
We are here, for our realization, for our emancipation.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:40.160
For the emancipation of all the humanity.

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:42.760
And then you your become enlightened light.

01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:46.560
You understand everything, this is your own power,which you use.

01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:50.800
And you try to help others, it's as simple as that.

01:01:54.360 --> 01:01:58.080
Now that's one point, which I told you, you cannot pay for it.

01:01:58.760 --> 01:02:01.960
No you can not, it's something beyond, it's not.

01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.440
The first you feel the all pervading power,

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:07.640
this cool breeze at your feeling is the.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:10.960
is the all pervading power.Now people have talked about it.

01:02:11.400 --> 01:02:14.480
Everybody even in Islamic religion if you see.

01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.120
It's described as a Rooh.

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.040
Every religion has talked of this all pervading power.

01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:24.200
Is the Brahama, In the sanskrit language is called as Brahama

01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:26.600
Now once you start feeling it,

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.560
Then, it's the first time you have felt it,

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:31.920
but unless and until you use it, you will know

01:02:32.520 --> 01:02:37.040
what it is like, for example a flower becomes a fruit.

01:02:37.560 --> 01:02:39.120
You take it for granted, who does all this?

01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:42.720
All the living work, imagine the tremendous kind,

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:48.400
of the choice that it manifest the way it works out.

01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.640
See there are tree and trees and trees.

01:02:51.640 --> 01:02:54.200
And how a particular tree gives a particular flower.

01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:58.400
How it gives a particular fruit, how grows to particular height.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:02.800
All this, who organize it, every moment.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:06.160
There are billion and billions of flowers becoming fruits.

01:03:07.400 --> 01:03:12.160
I will say, look at ourselves, our eyes how beautiful they are.

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.160
What a beautiful camera it is.

01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:15.680
all this is done by whom?

01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.760
There has to be some power who has done this. Isn't it?

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:21.920
We have become human beings, who has done this.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:25.640
This power, this Brahama and this Brahama power is

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.760
now you are feeling for the first time.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:33.280
But that makes your hands living

01:03:34.320 --> 01:03:35.280
The attention comes here,

01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.800
through your finger now, you will know everything.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:44.080
Because your central Nervous system your nerves

01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.280
have been enlighten by the spirit.

01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.960
That's how the knowledge is your own.

01:03:51.920 --> 01:03:54.800
You can verify within you, I asked this Peter Pears,

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.280
Who came as an Epileptic.

01:03:56.840 --> 01:03:58.640
Spoiling on the street in a horrible condition.

01:03:59.480 --> 01:04:00.920
He had to sell of his property everything.

01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.960
His wife was the Dukes grand daughter and all that.

01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.520
You should have seen in what condition he had come.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.200
Actually you won't believe it, if I tell you

01:04:08.800 --> 01:04:10.480
He had not a single pie left on him.

01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.440
And he had stay with Me to get along in that.

01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:17.880
And his wife, he is sitting here, he will tell you that.

01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.280
The fact that they were left without a single pie.

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.360
Health was horrible, they had all kinds of health problems.

01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.960
And still he never new that he was doing something wrong.

01:04:31.560 --> 01:04:33.120
So I asked him, "How is it, you did not discover?

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:35.720
His wife was epileptic.

01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:38.200
She use to get into epileptic things.

01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:42.160
For three hours, she would be just screaming and shouting.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.880
She would feel something is pulling her neck

01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:46.320
and could not petrified

01:04:47.160 --> 01:04:50.600
Three hours, such horrible state that reached.

01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:52.320
Daughter was in a big mess.

01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.880
She had become absolutely a lunatic personality.

01:04:57.200 --> 01:04:58.640
still he never realized, why?

01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:01.320
I asked him, "Why? with all your brains isn't it.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.160
The intelligent man, very intelligent man.

01:05:03.560 --> 01:05:04.600
She is a M.A, this that,

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.400
what's the use of all this intelligence.

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.920
If you cannot recognise these.

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:14.760
Till you finish every pie, every drop of your blood,

01:05:15.440 --> 01:05:16.800
Why were you continuing with that.

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:19.960
So he told Me that it was like a blanket.

01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.960
We did not know, which side we were moving.

01:05:23.200 --> 01:05:25.480
Every time he was trying some sought of trick on us.

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:28.720
You have to do better thing and you have to this course,

01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:31.560
that course and paying money for us.

01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:35.680
And that's how we collapsed and we did not know

01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.800
till we reach this stage, where we found we have nothing,

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.600
The other day somebody from Muktanand came,

01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:43.920
he was with him for sixteen years

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:45.680
and he said that, luckily  Mother

01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:48.480
I fell in love with an Indian girl in New York,

01:05:49.760 --> 01:05:51.960
And she told me that if you are a yogi

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.680
You don't look like a yogi at all,

01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:55.720
who is given you initiation and all that.

01:05:56.160 --> 01:05:57.280
If you have a Kundalini jagruti( Awakenning),

01:05:57.600 --> 01:05:58.840
if you are a realized soul.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:03.040
You should be blooming, you should have radiance on your face.

01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:04.120
It should be evident,

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.720
people should see that you are a person of that radiance.

01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:09.960
There is no radiance, you have such a sallow face.

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:13.360
Thin down absolutely, looks a sick man

01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:17.720
And how is it and she is the one, who told me this not possible.

01:06:18.600 --> 01:06:21.240
Now you just pray to God, God take me to right path.

01:06:22.280 --> 01:06:23.680
And you just won't believe into all these things,

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.680
she didn't know about Me or anything

01:06:26.040 --> 01:06:26.840
but she said, this is not the way.

01:06:27.480 --> 01:06:28.480
What we know of yogi is like that.

01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:30.920
Now you just don't believe into these crooks.

01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:32.600
Those who are taking money from you,

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:35.120
and look at your condition, sixteen years, what did you get.

01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:36.800
They have powers like this,

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.600
the people who are realized souls.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.960
Know about other people, they have collective consciousness.

01:06:41.600 --> 01:06:43.480
You don't have any collective consciousness or anything.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:45.240
She was just student a

01:06:45.720 --> 01:06:47.560
and she knew about it, these things in India

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.600
They are not naive, they know what it is.

01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.240
He say, he didn't even,

01:06:51.840 --> 01:06:54.760
he was told that I have awakened your Kundalini,

01:06:55.400 --> 01:06:56.320
he use to just jump.

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:58.680
And he use to take drugs, this and that

01:06:59.280 --> 01:07:00.880
he could not get over that drug business.

01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:04.240
She said, " How can you be a yogi, what are you talking?"

01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:07.000
How do you believe such nonsense, She said, "First get well."

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:10.120
You have no job, nothing, you are starving now.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.920
And he was thrown away from Ashram, when his money was finished.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.400
And you are living in the charities of the government.

01:07:18.120 --> 01:07:20.240
I don't want to marry such a man, who is a parasite....

01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:24.440
You just go away to India and find out the right answer, then

01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:30.280
He came to London, one of our Sahaja Yogi is a travel agent.

01:07:31.120 --> 01:07:33.080
He went there and saw My photograph.He said, "Who is this?"

01:07:33.960 --> 01:07:36.480
He said, It's Mother, He said, Mother I heard.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.400
There is one Anand Mayi Maa in India,

01:07:38.720 --> 01:07:39.880
where I am going to see her.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.600
He said, "Please don't go and see her

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:45.320
because my father and mother both ruined by her.

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.160
and we are absolutely, he was a very big man and

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:49.400
his father was really,

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.120
I don't know what happened to intelligent people in India.

01:07:52.600 --> 01:07:54.000
Because they are westernized you see,

01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.240
They don't want to know anything about God or anything,

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.080
The right way, they are so westernized

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.040
they want to know through English people.

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.120
So their knowledge is like this,

01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:04.040
all the plutocrat are that way

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:06.880
Built up that way, they will read all English books about Gita.

01:08:07.280 --> 01:08:10.520
Because they don't know Sanskrit, They don’t want to know directly

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.320
they want to know through some English Author.

01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.640
Who has written about Gita, because all are English biased, now

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.040
so he told that don't go this lady, but Mataji is here.

01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.680
But I don't know if you can meet her because she is very busy.

01:08:25.120 --> 01:08:26.280
May be, she may not meet up, but one thing,

01:08:26.840 --> 01:08:28.440
you can do it,  just dart into her house.

01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:31.320
And just tell her that Mother, I am a seeker

01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:34.440
and Dinesh has send me and sixteen years I have been with Muktanand

01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.480
She definitely will have compassion.

01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:42.320
I was about to go out somewhere.

01:08:42.920 --> 01:08:44.440
When suddenly I find him in the reception room,

01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:47.200
Just say, somebody stand, he  just said, Mother!

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:49.440
Please save me, I have been to Muktanand for sixteen years.

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.040
Then I said really! I canceled my going out.

01:08:52.600 --> 01:08:54.640
I said just a minute, sit down,

01:08:55.040 --> 01:08:56.360
We worked on him, he got his realization,

01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:58.840
And in Australia I hope to meet him sometime.

01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:00.960
He is in a big mess, because you see I told him

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.040
We told him, you cannot retain your things.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:05.480
Because he is booked he had to go away.

01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.760
I said, tomorrow if you wait, at least we can work it out.

01:09:09.280 --> 01:09:11.360
But he had to leave,hardly three hours left.

01:09:12.360 --> 01:09:13.800
So I said, Now it's all right we will see it,

01:09:14.240 --> 01:09:15.800
but that's what I am saying, it is like that.

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:21.680
We must have right understanding about God

01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:27.360
and right understanding about ourselves what should we have.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:32.160
and the ego should be controlled in a way that in sahaja yoga

01:09:34.520 --> 01:09:37.720
There is nothing that you have to give.

01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:42.840
Somebody said,"you have to surrender, they got a fright.

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.920
I said, What you surrender,what do you have?your ego.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.200
surrender your ego, that's all to God.

01:09:49.080 --> 01:09:51.920
Surrender your ego,ego is a stupid thing.

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:56.640
What do we do, what do we do, let's  see, at the most.

01:09:57.080 --> 01:09:59.040
Whatever is dead, convert it into something.

01:09:59.680 --> 01:10:02.120
Whatever is available, you make a mic this thing.

01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:07.480
This thing, this that but can we make even a particle of dust.

01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.720
Can we make ourselves, on our own.

01:10:11.800 --> 01:10:16.320
We don't do that, we do dead work, can we make?

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:20.600
A fruit out of a flower.

01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:24.840
What do we do? Why to have ego but rationally we understand

01:10:25.560 --> 01:10:28.480
but it is there you see existing, so we have to work it out.

01:10:29.080 --> 01:10:30.960
It's very simple in Sahaja Yoga, when are realized.

01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.200
How to put it down, the ego part.

01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:36.000
it is very simple.

01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.880
you have to just turn left side to your right and bring it down.

01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.360
You do it thrice it will go down, quite a bit.

01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:45.200
but you should be a realized soul, if you are not realized,

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:47.920
It won't work because your vibrations must flow

01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.000
and the vibrations just take it down

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.880
because they are subtle things.

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:53.880
They are subtle things, they go inside, they work it out

01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:56.880
with  subtlity subtely take it out that ego.

01:10:57.400 --> 01:10:58.680
because It's a subtle thing within your head ,

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.440
and they are even subtler then ego

01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:04.440
So take it down and push it out, You can do your self.

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.920
So you become the Doctor.

01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:10.000
You become the instrument, you become the Pathologist,

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:11.320
you become the medicine.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:16.960
For yourself and for others, that's what you should happen.

01:11:17.800 --> 01:11:20.160
You must have your own powers, if you go to a guru.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.440
You just won't paying him money.

01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:23.920
What powers have you got, just judge it on that one.

01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.200
What have you got? you have fought with your father,

01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:28.400
fought with mother, fought with wife,

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:31.040
everywhere you have created a problem for yourself.

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:33.760
There is no relationship with the whole society

01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:37.200
even these stair  people everyone even afraid of a garlic

01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:38.080
Do you know that?

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:40.720
You show them a garlic, they will start jumping.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:42.960
I mean, imagine to be afraid,

01:11:43.440 --> 01:11:45.040
of something of vegetable.

01:11:45.800 --> 01:11:48.560
You have to be a powerful personality.

01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:52.360
That doesn’t mean you aggress anybody, you do not aggress anybody.

01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.520
But you are a powerful person in your love.

01:11:57.080 --> 01:12:00.400
Love is the most powerful thing and most effective,

01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.440
but love also doesn’t mean the way

01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:03.400
this fellow talks of this your..

01:12:04.480 --> 01:12:06.760
fourteen year old fellow about love.

01:12:07.280 --> 01:12:09.720
Go mad after him,you see singing together,

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.560
What's this, he has created such a mess for?

01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.160
They are all getting mad,

01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.000
All will end up into lunatic asylum or in the hospital.

01:12:20.440 --> 01:12:22.480
All get either Cancers or

01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:25.240
multiple sclerosis, all sorts of diseases.

01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:29.280
When they come to Me at the last stage, when the discover, Oh God

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:33.280
For somebody got multiple psoriasis and he went to a Doctor

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.960
He was surprised, he was surfing this guru for so many years.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:38.520
And how did he get and then he comes to Me.

01:12:40.800 --> 01:12:42.160
Then he realizes for

01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:45.960
What to do, you see people must go through the whole,

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:47.880
the whole experiences are such extremist that

01:12:48.240 --> 01:12:50.640
unless until they are completely ripped off, all there.

01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.920
things, they don't come to Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:56.400
But some are, they were  intelligent, they understand.

01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.560
and at a point they just give up.

01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.280
Whatever be the state, doesn’t matter

01:13:01.960 --> 01:13:03.960
you are seeker, we have to work out.

01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.680
Everyone has to work out. All the Sahaja Yogi have to work out.

01:13:09.200 --> 01:13:11.640
But that help should not challenge your ego.It's a help.

01:13:12.160 --> 01:13:13.720
because you are part and parcel of us.

01:13:15.040 --> 01:13:16.960
If this finger is paining if I rub it.

01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.600
Then I am not trying to help you I am helping Myself.

01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:21.720
If I am helping you, I am helping myself.

01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:25.040
Because something of Me is paining.

01:13:25.960 --> 01:13:27.640
Which I have to help, nobody is there.

01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.880
In Sahaja Yoga there is nobody, who is the other.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.840
You are all one, just now you are not enlightened.

01:13:34.440 --> 01:13:35.760
doesn't matter, we get you enlightened.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.560
But we are all one, only thing what you have to become is

01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.360
enlightened one. Once you are enlightened,

01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:45.080
then you become collectively conscious,

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.280
then you realized that you are the one

01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:49.400
Of the whole, you become, its all again you become

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:52.840
You become a realized soul.

01:13:53.840 --> 01:13:56.120
and you become collectively conscious.

01:13:57.080 --> 01:13:59.040
You are become conscious that

01:13:59.360 --> 01:14:01.200
you are part and parcel of the whole.you become.

01:14:01.800 --> 01:14:03.760
Don't have to form a UN or some sorts of things.

01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:07.120
Just become, your awareness becomes.

01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:12.480
That should be so easy, so logically you understand Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:16.400
Because your brain, after coming from all these experience

01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:19.360
just starts judging Sahaja Yoga. So can understand it logic.

01:14:20.440 --> 01:14:21.480
After that you must know that

01:14:22.840 --> 01:14:25.480
When the Kundalini passes over Agaya Chakra,

01:14:25.800 --> 01:14:26.840
you become thoughtless.

01:14:27.240 --> 01:14:30.760
Means there is a space in between the thoughts, one thought rises

01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.680
another arises passes down, there is a space in between.

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.720
those two thoughts and that is place, where you have to reach.

01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:42.280
Once you are there, you are thoughtlessly aware.

01:14:43.440 --> 01:14:46.600
This is called as Nirvichar Samadhi, where you go and become

01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:49.680
thoughtlessly aware, Nirvichar Samadhi.

01:14:50.520 --> 01:14:52.560
And then when the Kundalini pears es through here.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:56.960
Absolutely pears es and comes out very well.

01:14:57.800 --> 01:15:00.160
You can give realization moving your hands just liken this,

01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:01.760
it flows from your hands.

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:05.840
It's true, It looks like testing, but you can give realization.

01:15:07.200 --> 01:15:09.160
Once the Kundalini has pears you can.

01:15:10.200 --> 01:15:12.320
but there are temptations, people have

01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:15.960
become egoistical,they think they are great all that, is not true.

01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:20.440
You have just become conscious of being part and parcel.

01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:26.200
If you understand that, that you have now become

01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:30.720
entitle to use this power of compassion of God

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:34.440
power of his love, through you, you can maneuver it.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:37.480
know how to handle it, you are the instrument which understands

01:15:38.800 --> 01:15:41.160
and that's how, you become the spirit now,

01:15:41.760 --> 01:15:43.240
because the spirit is the connection.

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:46.800
It's so wonderful afterward your health

01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:48.920
I mean your doctor's pills goes to zero.

01:15:50.480 --> 01:15:53.360
You never get bored, you are always employed

01:15:54.680 --> 01:15:57.160
You have no time, for anything, you are a very busy person.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.960
My little grand child was hardly five years,

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.480
once we went to the airport, very busy, like this, like this.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.720
so My daughter asked," What are you doing?"

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.680
Why are you so busy, so don't talk just now.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.560
She said, "What are you doing." She is a born realized child.

01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.680
Very much knowledgeable, she knows a lot about Sahaja Yoga,

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.400
from her childhood from her birth.

01:16:22.040 --> 01:16:25.960
Now done. What? I was tying the whole of

01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:30.720
Whole of airport, is very messy place.

01:16:33.480 --> 01:16:35.440
So they are busy people you see, you become busy too

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.040
because you know it, you know the problem, you are there.

01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:43.040
They start doing it. How are you? Better.

01:16:46.800 --> 01:16:50.800
Put him left to the right.

01:16:51.880 --> 01:16:54.160
Sound! you have sound in the ear.

01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:09.640
You got some oil here, Olive oil or something

01:17:12.960 --> 01:17:14.120
or some ghee, have you got?

01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.480
You can get some oil, I will vibrate.

01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:23.200
Now next time you all should bring your oil and your salt and sugar

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:25.440
I will vibrate for you. We have to look up.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:28.880
See our body everything we have to respect ourselves.

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.200
This is the temple of God and the temple has to be looked after.

01:17:32.760 --> 01:17:34.760
Get her this to, because you have jumped.

01:17:35.040 --> 01:17:37.520
into all kinds of things you know all thorns and things.

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.480
It's like that so better get it prepared completely

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:45.080
It's better, now are you all right? Still there.

01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.760
Let come, I will just work it, come here.

You just say, that forgive me if I have done anything wrong.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.640
Just say it in your heart.

01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:19.480
Olive oil. But you see how can you give it to everyone.

01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.280
They should bring of their own.You can give it to this gentleman.

01:18:25.640 --> 01:18:26.840
Now you must pay for this olive oil.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:28.440
Whatever it is to the gentleman.

01:18:28.920 --> 01:18:30.560
You shouldn't take anybody else's thing, all right.

01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.840
That's not done in Sahaja Yoga, we must pay for our oil

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.760
and sugar and all that. We shouldn't

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:46.600

This is sugar, Yogi: salt,salt.

01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:50.720
Take it out, how you take out salt here.

01:28:51.280 --> 01:28:53.640
You can't push it back.

01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:56.520
Can you open this? Yes you can, I think.

01:28:57.160 --> 01:29:01.120
Just take it out.

01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:04.600
I will do it for them, all of them one by one.It's all right.

01:29:05.080 --> 01:29:05.880
Can you open it.

01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:16.440
Not suppose to come out, is it?

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:24.960
All right, good idea.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:30.560
I vibrate it, use this for your dandruff

01:29:30.920 --> 01:29:33.240
Add this salt, anywhere you use salt, specially

01:29:33.680 --> 01:29:35.720
for your gargling and all that, this is very good.

01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:38.680
Keeps your throat all right to gargling.

01:29:39.680 --> 01:29:41.600
Every morning will be a good idea.

01:29:42.120 --> 01:29:43.080
And also good for your teeth,

01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:45.080
you see, you mix up little bit of that.

01:29:45.560 --> 01:29:47.640
Olive oil with this and you see you rub gums with.

01:29:48.200 --> 01:29:49.960
It's very good for your teeth, all right

01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.320
We have to look after our body very much

01:29:58.080 --> 01:29:59.520
but in such a way that it is

01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.320
attended to in a proper way, in a methodical way, all right.

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:09.520
never, see show you.

01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:12.560
Sugar is because

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.760
See we we have liver problems, most of us have liver problem.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:18.800
And that's why the sugar is vibrated.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:30.080
If you can open there thing I can give it to every one.

01:30:32.160 --> 01:30:33.640
This I am explaining for everyone.

01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:36.720
So you will ....,It's all right, now this

01:30:37.240 --> 01:30:40.240
Lemon add this, for sugar, any sugar.

01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.400
She take sugar, as much as she can

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.360
But if they Yer says, you have liver,

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:46.000
then you should take little extra sugar

01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.160
But you mix it up with other sugar.

01:30:49.000 --> 01:30:50.320
SM: Go on mixing that. Y: I see.

01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:51.960
SM: It can be added up. Y: Yes yes.

01:30:52.360 --> 01:30:54.200
These lemon, these lemons are

01:30:54.880 --> 01:30:57.440
something very good, they absorb My vibrations very fast.

01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:59.120
Y: Yes. SM:  Now these are very good.

01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:01.880
and the chillies are, for the, you see seven.

01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:03.800
right hand sided and the

01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:05.760
seven for the left hand side.

01:31:06.200 --> 01:31:08.320
You have to put them under your pillow or

01:31:09.280 --> 01:31:11.040
I mean the pillow side.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.680
under ground with this plastic bag

01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:17.120
opened up in the night and closed in the day time.

01:31:17.920 --> 01:31:20.680
You use it for seven nights, it sucks in all your negativity.

01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:22.320
surprising its wonderful.

01:31:23.080 --> 01:31:24.440
I have cure many mad people with this,

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:26.560
epilepsy and all that, it's wonderful thing.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:28.800
Lemons are very good you see.

01:31:31.120 --> 01:31:32.800
and morning time you close it.

01:31:33.600 --> 01:31:35.720
and then the whole thing should be thrown.

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:38.120
After using it for seven nights.

01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:41.160
into the river.

01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:43.920
or somewhere it goes out, that's all.

01:31:46.160 --> 01:31:48.360
This will take away all the negativity you have.

01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.880
take out that.

01:31:52.960 --> 01:31:56.760
Can you out this, now open that one.

01:31:58.040 --> 01:32:00.560
If you can open that one.

01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:03.880
This is a very wonderful thing.

01:32:10.840 --> 01:32:12.720
Try this, it will make you very light and nice

01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:15.600
You will feel very happy, just now you close it down.

01:32:16.160 --> 01:32:18.960
How will you take this, can you give her a plastic thing

01:32:22.480 --> 01:32:23.960
close it down

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:35.200
Its good for you to gargle

01:32:35.440 --> 01:32:37.160
because of Vishuddhi, you see,

01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:40.720
Vishuddhi is very bad, you have to gargle yourself,

01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:43.800
Now I would request somebody can, can anyone?

01:32:44.240 --> 01:32:46.680
Can any one fix his neck here.

01:32:48.080 --> 01:32:50.720
You can, all right, just fix that

01:32:51.840 --> 01:32:52.760
All right, Doctor you do it.

01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:55.560

01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:06.560

01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:11.320
Be kept here, just put  it, be relaxed.

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:18.080
Now this one is good for his gargling.

01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:23.400
They may need some plastic bags I think

01:33:43.800 --> 01:33:45.280
Put your hands towards Me.

01:33:47.080 --> 01:33:49.520

Good now, sit down, Check the vibrations.

01:34:38.160 --> 01:34:40.280
use a proper pillow for yourself, all right.

01:34:40.920 --> 01:34:43.280
Never twist the pillow, make the pillow nice one.

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:46.520
not too high, not too low, just in the center.

01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.200
You say about, should not be more then five inches.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.080
Yes, better.

01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:00.840
Five to six inches, that's all, better now, are you feeling?

01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:03.800

Anyone who will tell them,  Alm can you come down?

01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:30.520

He is Shiva's bhakta, that's why,

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:19.880
Put your right hand on your heart.

01:36:21.160 --> 01:36:23.280
And say Mother, I am the spirit.It will work out,

01:36:23.840 --> 01:36:25.280
because of that Saharara not opening.

01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:26.880
Shiva's place is here (Sahasrara) right one.

01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.920
Just see now, on the head, you

And also use it for your head, will be good.

01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:16.120
For the,for the shoulder you should bring actually.

01:37:16.520 --> 01:37:18.640

01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:20.440

01:37:20.960 --> 01:37:23.280
Or olive oil, but this one is good for hair.

01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:26.800

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.320
Oh My God, It's so hot.

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:46.640
Oh My God, so much heat is coming out.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.440
All the heat. Yogi: This is what my mother says.

01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:54.640
Now it is getting cooler.

01:37:56.840 --> 01:37:58.800
Such heat ! Oh

01:38:05.640 --> 01:38:08.600
Indians understand things so better

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:10.920
You don't have to tell them.

01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:14.480
They know what it is, they know the importance of feet.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:16.720
You see it's very simple to tell them

01:38:21.960 --> 01:38:24.800
with other people, one has to be carefully, interducing the subject.

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.800
This with Indians, go head long, they know everything.

01:38:35.240 --> 01:38:37.520
Are you all right now?

01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.480
It's too hot, it all happened due to this.

01:38:41.840 --> 01:38:44.440
Whatever you have done, It will pass off

01:38:46.320 --> 01:38:49.840
Take a photo from us and put one hand towards the photo.

01:38:50.400 --> 01:38:53.640
and the other hand outside, it will go out, it is much better.

01:38:54.640 --> 01:38:57.840
Are you feeling better, is it cooling, is it good?

01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:03.680
Void is also caught badly.

01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:16.200
Put your hand under the feet.

01:39:31.600 --> 01:39:32.680
All right.

01:39:36.560 --> 01:39:39.040
That his Kundalini wobbling absolutely down below.

01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.480

01:40:29.560 --> 01:40:30.960
Humm better

01:40:44.120 --> 01:40:48.360
Now see, feeling better, put your hand on your head.

01:40:57.320 --> 01:40:58.200

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:02.200
Not yet come? Y: No.

01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:08.600
Mother: It will come. Yogi: What is blocking, What is bl;blocking?

01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.040
Y : What is stopping. SM :In this you know.

you have gone to different places.These people mesmerize you.

01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:19.000
Put your hand behind, this side.

01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.880
Now ask a question, Mother, Are you Mataji Nirmala Devi?

01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.440
SM: Is it there. Yogi: Yes a little bit.

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:03.440
Left hand towards the photograph and the other hand outside.

01:42:04.680 --> 01:42:06.360
Left hand towards the photograph and right hand outside,

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:08.400
You have catch in your left side.

01:42:10.920 --> 01:42:15.440
Emotion, emotional thing, but it comes from horrible things

01:42:16.040 --> 01:42:18.000
you have been to, see they give you emotional problem.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:22.160
Left side, it is all impure knowledge.

01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:25.160
Better.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:34.080
Humm better.

01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:41.760
Are you unhappy with me?

01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.640
Haa ha, I am unhappy.

01:42:44.920 --> 01:42:46.400
I am not unhappy, but they are  stupid.

01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:48.280
Let everybody go there, thing may improve(sarcastically She says).

01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.000
Now it has come, it is all right.

01:42:58.360 --> 01:43:02.120
Improving, keep coming here, are you living near by?

01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.440
Now go, look after him, Y: OK. May God bless you.

01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:13.960
Y: Sted will export brown sugar

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:20.800
But it is all right for him, he has a right Nabhi.

01:43:21.440 --> 01:43:23.440
He is left, left, I am sorry

01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:26.280
He has a left liver, what you call that

01:43:26.880 --> 01:43:30.320
is a cold liver, so put, it's all right.

01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:34.040

All right, can you take out your coat, I will fix that.

01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:52.400
Another thing is, no guru works anything.

01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.840
They just sit down on this seventh floor.

01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:57.880
Just that, move that side.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:01.240

put a candle in front of it, put your left hand

01:45:06.720 --> 01:45:08.480
towards the photograph and right hand on the mother earth.

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.320
She will suck your problems.

01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:15.720
Arthritis can be cured, yes

01:45:16.600 --> 01:45:19.040
Lift your hand still frozen.

01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:22.520
up to what point, doesn't take

01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:28.640
put it on the ground.

01:45:38.680 --> 01:45:40.560
How is he? All right ?

01:45:41.480 --> 01:45:43.680
Feeling the cool breeze, how about this lady?

01:45:47.760 --> 01:45:48.480
What about the lady there?

01:45:49.120 --> 01:45:50.800
Y: Doesn't want it Mother. SM: she is all right.

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:53.000
Doesn't want it. SM, I could see that.

01:45:54.040 --> 01:45:57.400
You have too much ego My child in you? Why did you come here?

01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:01.800
If you didn't want it, why did you come here?

01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:06.120
Y: She understand. S M: Understand what?

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.720
Can you understand God? What is there to understand?

01:46:12.840 --> 01:46:15.600
You see your intelligence is limited.

01:46:16.920 --> 01:46:19.040
your rationality is limited, your mind is limited.

01:46:20.200 --> 01:46:21.680
We are talking about unlimited.

01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:25.640
It is like trying to understand

01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.280
Histology without getting seeing through the microscope.

01:46:31.400 --> 01:46:35.080
Can't understand anything, you don't want your self realization.

01:46:36.520 --> 01:46:37.480
Why?  you don't want it

01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:43.960
What is it

01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:48.480
What, more about what?

01:46:50.240 --> 01:46:51.400
But you should getting of first of all,

01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:53.640
otherwise how will you know.

01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:56.560
They just said Me, Isn't it absurd.

01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:59.400
Isn't it now

01:46:59.960 --> 01:47:01.160
Isn't it absurd, don't you think so?

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:03.480
Unless and until you will get it how will you know

01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:05.920
Because I can't tell you why are moving hands like this.

01:47:06.480 --> 01:47:08.200
you don't  can't feel anything, what can we do,

01:47:08.720 --> 01:47:10.200
you must get your realization, better get it.

01:47:11.480 --> 01:47:13.240
All right, there is no question of understanding it.

01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:15.520
That rationality how far can you go?

01:47:17.680 --> 01:47:19.320
SM :Yes. Y: She says she can feel it."

01:47:19.720 --> 01:47:21.720
you are feeling what cool breeze?

01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:23.920
Yes, what she says.

01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:29.160
She said, she is asking whether it's, whether it's

01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:32.480
inside already, why does she need to get it.

01:47:34.120 --> 01:47:35.720
What makes you think, it is inside.

01:47:38.920 --> 01:47:41.440
Is everybody has it but it is not manifesting, isn't it?

01:47:42.920 --> 01:47:45.600
Is it there you feel so?

01:47:47.840 --> 01:47:50.040
Do you feel you have got, you are all ready a realized soul?

01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.920
You think so, you think so?

01:47:55.760 --> 01:47:58.240
SM :What she says. This is thought particular when you born Mother.

01:47:58.600 --> 01:48:01.480
She is asking,  doesn't God put it there when you are born.

01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.320
Yes it is always there within you.

01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:06.560
All right as a human being you have it. but it's not manifesting.

01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:09.520
It has to manifest.

01:48:11.520 --> 01:48:14.760
SM: How did? Y: How can you give it to her Mother? SM: No I can't

01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:17.720
It's your own, it's not, you see like one light.

01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.280
which is enlighten

01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:21.280
Enlightens another light.

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:22.880
It nothing giving.

01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:25.520
You understand that.

01:48:26.880 --> 01:48:30.320
Then you can't, because can  a light, which is not enlightened

01:48:30.880 --> 01:48:32.560
can be enlightened and what's the harm if I give you.

01:48:33.120 --> 01:48:34.360
I am not hitting you hard.

01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:36.480
I am doing anything wrong thing, what's wrong.

01:48:37.080 --> 01:48:38.800
If I want to give you a present, won't you have it?

01:48:39.320 --> 01:48:40.440
You will definitely have.

01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.520
Where you have fought?

01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:50.560
Y : What exactly you are doing Mother?

01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:53.080
Because that's the trouble, you are wearing us

01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:55.560
we are wearing for all of us. Not only for,

01:48:56.320 --> 01:48:58.680
But you are wearing us all, means we are,

01:48:59.120 --> 01:49:02.720
we never likes  such people here, those who are egoistical.

01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:05.600
See if you have to get it, you better get

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:07.440
otherwise don't come here.

01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:17.080
She must be told that she has to get it first time Mother.

01:49:17.920 --> 01:49:20.400
Not first time but at least try, you can't say no.

01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:21.880
It's not, this is the place

01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.200
where we give self realization to people.

01:49:24.760 --> 01:49:27.320
Not because you style our vibrations by this way.

01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.560
It is not for argument or anything,

01:49:30.080 --> 01:49:31.600
if you don't at least  leave us alone.

01:49:32.000 --> 01:49:34.120
Everybody has to get it otherwise you go away.

01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:36.760
Why to waste our energy, every bodies energy

01:49:37.320 --> 01:49:39.240
You don't want to do it, you don't want to trouble us.

01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.920
You are, I am telling you that.

01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:45.360
It is for us to decide this, is it? Yes of course.

01:49:45.880 --> 01:49:49.000
These are our premises, we know which people are troubling us.

01:49:49.960 --> 01:49:51.560
Yes I invited you not to trouble Me,

01:49:52.120 --> 01:49:54.560
Because we asked you to put, what we want to do.

01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:55.920
You should do otherwise you should go away.

01:49:56.440 --> 01:49:58.520
Why are you here, I mean, supposing you go to a place

01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:02.160
You can not do what you like, you have to do

01:50:02.960 --> 01:50:05.520
You you if you don't understand

01:50:05.960 --> 01:50:07.080
After what I have talked,

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:09.080
you can never understand, we are sorry.

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:10.800
You can never understand,

01:50:11.280 --> 01:50:12.200
you are not the one, who wants to understand

01:50:13.600 --> 01:50:14.760
You are not the type to understand,

01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:16.440
what is so harming in putting your hands.

01:50:16.960 --> 01:50:18.240
You are not going to be killed, are you going to be killed,

01:50:19.320 --> 01:50:20.240
What's going to be happen?

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:22.600
I mean you enter any pub you want to,

01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:24.640
You want to talk to any man, you want to

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:26.840
What is the harm in putting your hands like this?

01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.840
What's the thing, that's going to happen?

01:50:30.320 --> 01:50:35.040
Beg a pardon.You didn't want. Y: Say there is  any harm in it.

01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:39.040
Then why didn't you do, why are telling no to people.

01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:44.600
All right, first time you may not have it, but we have to try.

01:50:45.320 --> 01:50:47.280
You see if you just don't do it now, when will you do it.

01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:52.040
We are not going to waste our time, all right, this is it.

01:50:53.320 --> 01:50:54.840
You are not so important to us

01:50:55.400 --> 01:50:56.760
that you must get your realization.

01:50:57.160 --> 01:50:58.960
But one thing if you are not taking your realization

01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:01.440
and you are just putting your force here

01:51:01.920 --> 01:51:04.880
You are spoiling, the energies of others, no doubts

01:51:06.280 --> 01:51:08.160
You will understand if get your realization.

01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:10.400
Otherwise you won't, that's the trouble with you.

01:51:11.040 --> 01:51:13.920
You don't want to get your realization how will you understand

01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:17.080
You see you cannot do like this, wherever you go,

01:51:17.640 --> 01:51:21.000
you have to according to the place you are going

01:51:21.560 --> 01:51:24.720
supposing you go to the Church and you take out your hat

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:27.040
if you are man, if you are lady, you have to wear your hats.

01:51:27.840 --> 01:51:29.960
You see that also you will do there but not here,

01:51:30.520 --> 01:51:32.600
Here you want to take your liberties for everything, how can you?

01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:35.400
What say?

01:51:38.240 --> 01:51:40.120
What do you want to understand, what do you want to understand.

01:51:40.600 --> 01:51:42.400
And so far you have been saying I am on twenty seven, what?

01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:51.200
You see that is true but it is not abandonment, it's not madness.

01:51:52.760 --> 01:51:55.240
It's too different from Church all together but it doesn't mean.

01:51:55.880 --> 01:51:58.240
It doesn't mean that you can just come here and sit and watch

01:51:58.880 --> 01:52:01.360
everyone like inspector general, it's not so.

01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:03.400
Then why why did you come?

01:52:03.920 --> 01:52:06.080
You see, you have come for this purpose for self realization,

01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:07.160
All right

01:52:10.320 --> 01:52:12.680
Who who, who, just a minute, who told you that?

01:52:13.680 --> 01:52:16.080
What, which one he what a sister?

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:19.280
I was very val...

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.000
What did you tell her that you here and watch?

01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:29.400
He said, He told too much, Mother, That's why she got ruined.

01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:32.680
That's what I say that with rationality see if you tell them

01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:35.440
they get off, don't tell them too much.

01:52:36.400 --> 01:52:38.600
They come, they think they are inspector general come here

01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.520
To see everyone.

01:52:40.880 --> 01:52:42.720
Too much you told, you should not.

01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:44.880
I told you many a times not to talk too much.

01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:47.840
Because ego is such it sits on your head

01:52:48.320 --> 01:52:51.000
They suddenly becomes inspector General, see

01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:54.480
That's the trouble with them.Now better, are you.

01:52:55.840 --> 01:52:58.240
It's much better now. Good, see

01:52:58.840 --> 01:53:01.520
Now see this, listen here, you are going, listen here.

01:53:02.360 --> 01:53:05.280
She this gentleman's hand is now better, did you see that.

01:53:07.040 --> 01:53:09.520
Now do you want to understand that, how it has happened.

01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:26.280
You see, in this country

01:53:27.320 --> 01:53:29.160
In this country the ego is so much.

01:53:30.040 --> 01:53:32.520
That you don't know, how to and what extent it can go.

01:53:33.480 --> 01:53:36.360
We had in our house the guest, who was the chairman

01:53:37.440 --> 01:53:40.000
of the High Court judges of  Hail.

01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:43.040
Now believe it, what a man he must be.

01:53:43.400 --> 01:53:46.000
And we had a garbage cleaner, who came to our house.

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:50.000
I asked in that, this little more you have to take.

01:53:50.560 --> 01:53:52.520
So I will give you some extra money, please take it today.

01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:56.640
So he said, "you don't understand the laws of this country

01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:59.000
You don't understand this, I need more money,

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:02.480
this  that he was shouting, so he came out, this gentleman

01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:04.200
He said, "why are you shouting, what is the matter?"

01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:06.400
You Indians, you don't understand any law at all

01:54:06.920 --> 01:54:08.480
He is the man who is international laws

01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:11.120
You see, he is the chairman of all the thing,

01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:12.920
he was looking at him.

01:54:13.240 --> 01:54:15.360
And I just reel into laughter, see I couldn't see this.

01:54:15.920 --> 01:54:19.160
Garbage cleaner talking to him, so much ego.

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:21.240
Ego, this is ego, you know this is stupidity,

01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:23.600
the edocity just see, so clear.

01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:26.960
The way she was talking to Me, at least she must be a

01:54:27.480 --> 01:54:29.760
Maha Yogi to talk like that.

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:31.720
Any one of it? Isn't it.

01:54:32.160 --> 01:54:34.400
But here in this country you see, nobody is shameful of it.

01:54:35.080 --> 01:54:36.320
There is no humility.

01:54:37.680 --> 01:54:40.680
Even the President of India will stand, when I go to see him.

01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:43.760
You will be amazed, he would not sit till I sit down.

01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.360
They have this innate humility, look at this boy,

01:54:48.760 --> 01:54:50.360
he came and just said, I must touch your feet.

01:54:53.040 --> 01:54:55.160
See this is the course of all western civilization.

01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:57.880
Then only the people,who mesmerize them, we bowed to them.

01:54:59.480 --> 01:55:02.240
Those who be fool us we bow to them. Isn't it.

01:55:02.880 --> 01:55:05.840
We should understand, " this is a course of our country, be careful.

01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:09.680
Be careful, look at her the way she was talking.

01:55:11.720 --> 01:55:13.080
She was not interested anything.

01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.120
she came just to see and understand

01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:17.160
Who is she to understand, I don't understand this.

01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:19.080
What does she think about herself.

01:55:22.640 --> 01:55:25.320
Where is her brother? US, PHD.

01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:27.520
Poor thing I am sorry.Where is he gone?

01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:39.120
I you are invited, you can not do what you laugh.

01:55:43.840 --> 01:55:48.440
Much better,now Lets see, hold My hand tight and that put down

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:58.120
Better, keep your right hand upwards.

01:55:58.760 --> 01:56:01.400
Like this, you have weakness in your left side.

01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:06.840
Better, left is weak.

01:56:09.760 --> 01:56:13.000
Mother: flowing  do you feel the energy flowing.Y: Much better.

01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:21.960
This is nothing, we had drunkard, you see, who are with Me.

01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:28.000
Much more then this.

01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:30.840
Very Road  chaap( very cheap), get the top his voice.

01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.000
But first I didn't know that he was a drunkard as person.

01:56:35.320 --> 01:56:36.640
They told Me, Mother he is a drunkard.

01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:38.520
I said," All right, let him talk."

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:40.280
It's a good certificate for Me.

01:56:42.360 --> 01:56:43.800
What's that, now it's all right,

01:56:44.240 --> 01:56:45.840
And how much time they waste of others, you see.

01:56:48.160 --> 01:56:49.800
As if she doesn't want to do, you can ask her to go.

01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:53.280
Please go away, why are you sitting here.

01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:55.520
Very humbly you should say, better go away, sorry, you go away.

01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:58.800
She has just waste every bodies energy, what  she thinks of herself.

01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:12.880
Y : She was a saint.SM: I don't know.

01:57:14.000 --> 01:57:16.960
Its nothing but simple ego, you cannot explain it.

01:57:17.480 --> 01:57:18.680
See that's very stupid thing

01:57:19.160 --> 01:57:20.920
.It's ego and that's leads you to edocity

01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:23.560
That's why the sensitivity is so low.

01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:25.560
You see can not  make out.

01:57:28.680 --> 01:57:30.920
See even from the face they cannot make out.

01:57:31.280 --> 01:57:35.160
anything it's insensitive, they don't understand beauty, nothing.

01:57:35.600 --> 01:57:38.120
Nothing they understand, if you are insensitive, it happens.

01:57:38.640 --> 01:57:40.840
How are you now? Now!

01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:43.080

Yogini :Yes. SM: Liver you have still.

01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:02.960
Now, what should we do? Did you get some sugar.

01:58:03.440 --> 01:58:05.560
Is that's the sugar there? .....

01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:08.160
Sugar is yes, sugar is more important now then anything.

01:58:08.680 --> 01:58:12.040
Liver is out, you have to work it out.

01:58:12.480 --> 01:58:14.320
All right, liver is very....

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:16.760
Yogini : What do I do with it?

01:58:17.200 --> 01:58:18.000
Less thinking.

01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:22.720
That's my problem, that's my problem.

01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:26.160
Come here I will fix it. Now there is only one way.

01:58:26.800 --> 01:58:29.880
is to believe in Christ, all right, now lets see, close your eyes.

01:58:30.200 --> 01:58:33.240
Just believe in Him, He did exists.

01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:36.200
Yogini: I believe, He exist yes. SM : that.

01:58:36.760 --> 01:58:37.440
Yogini :You clear them now.SM: All right.

01:58:37.840 --> 01:58:39.800
Mother," All right now still there is  an effect here.

01:58:42.760 --> 01:58:45.840
I am still have a lot of guilt and negativity.

01:58:46.480 --> 01:58:49.040
Unnecessarily why do you have a guilt.

01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:50.640
SM: Don't have any guilt.Yogini: I do.

01:58:51.160 --> 01:58:52.680
Yogini,"I do have I don't know why?"

01:58:53.080 --> 01:58:56.640
That's goes with the whole catch, conditioning.

01:58:58.080 --> 01:58:59.120
Now better.

01:59:09.440 --> 01:59:12.240
Is  your hand trembling? Y: Yes. SM: Give a jerk to it.

01:59:13.120 --> 01:59:15.360
This will start showing, shake also your hands will shake.

01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.280
Which ever is the weakness, you see it's come out.

01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:21.800
Take out your watch for a while.

01:59:26.200 --> 01:59:29.480
Better now, but still there.

01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:35.960
Sit comfortable, please comfortable, take time sometime.

01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:49.200
Yogini :I think now I had liver problem. SM: you have.

01:59:55.200 --> 02:00:00.760
SM : Eyes are steadied, you have a kataar or something.

02:00:05.720 --> 02:00:08.400
SM: Did you bring any oil? Yogini: Yes the little bottle."

02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:11.800

Mother, "Yes yes you can."

02:00:27.080 --> 02:00:31.240
Hamsa is very bad, did you give her camphor?

02:00:32.160 --> 02:00:34.120
SM: This lady. Yogi: Yes Mother, shall I give her more.

02:00:35.560 --> 02:00:37.320
Did you put some camphor here?Yogini: No.

02:00:38.120 --> 02:00:40.400
Better do it, she takes from him that camphor.

02:00:41.600 --> 02:00:44.920
will be good, put little bit in the nose, that oil.

02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:47.760
With little in the ears, camphor is good for ears.

02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:51.360

02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:53.320

How are you now better.

02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:12.880
You gargle yourself, add more salt, use it for gargle.

02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:45.200
they have such a small neck, I don't know.

02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:59.360
It's a complete medicine shop.

02:05:00.920 --> 02:05:02.600
All right just to be turn.

02:05:05.560 --> 02:05:06.680

If she serves like this.

02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:00.800
You can imagine.

02:06:03.680 --> 02:06:05.200
You should not have told her about this.

02:06:05.800 --> 02:06:07.240
You must see the person, how he is.

02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:10.080
Very much egoistical.

02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:13.840
Very ego oriented.

02:06:16.640 --> 02:06:18.600
And they don't feel it, you see in this country,

02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:20.960
you can carry on with this but in India you cannot.

02:06:21.480 --> 02:06:23.240
If you are like this they will all through you out.

02:06:23.680 --> 02:06:26.440
In the society you can't exist, is a person with a such strong

02:06:26.960 --> 02:06:28.680
tongue and all that. You have to be humble.Isn't it?

02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:31.360
You can't tolerate a man who talks like this

02:06:32.080 --> 02:06:34.520

What about your eyes? Is it low....

02:07:28.920 --> 02:07:30.360
Also use a candle.

02:07:33.200 --> 02:07:35.000
Ask somebody to give you a bandhan on your back.

02:07:35.560 --> 02:07:37.560
Someone on the back Agaya for your eyes

02:07:38.200 --> 02:07:41.040

02:07:55.320 --> 02:07:57.360

Y: get for me. SM: For you it's all right, sugar is all right.

02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:16.560
You never brought any sugar.

02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:20.760
Is there any sugar for him, give him some vibrated sugar.

02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:22.960
When he goes for America,  all right.

02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:28.600
This is a good one, this is a good idea.

02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:31.840
Yes, I mean I can put My fingers in.

02:08:47.560 --> 02:08:50.040
Is there somebody, who has to do.

02:08:54.040 --> 02:08:57.080
For him, you can tell him the photograph.

02:08:57.680 --> 02:08:59.240
You work out with the photograph?

02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:01.280
All of you should on the photograph yourself.

Seven days you are going to carry.

02:09:03.880 --> 02:09:06.480
because  for left it will be better off.

02:09:07.040 --> 02:09:08.720
You can give the photographs, all of you.

02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:10.760
and tell them how to use it.It should work out.

02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:13.360
For seven days let them work out with the photograph.

02:09:16.320 --> 02:09:19.000
You also take the photograph.

02:09:35.880 --> 02:09:38.680
Rosy Kroshan is another....

02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:45.240
All very avidya

02:09:48.680 --> 02:09:50.440
They talk on a mental level.

02:09:56.640 --> 02:09:59.520
They teach on a mental level.

02:10:00.040 --> 02:10:01.800
Y: Up bring themselves on a spiritual level.

02:10:02.200 --> 02:10:03.320
They don't think of that.

02:10:04.720 --> 02:10:06.400
They don't think, it's a money making proposition again.

02:10:07.240 --> 02:10:08.120
It's in a way.

02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:13.680
It is it is, it will end up like that.

02:10:14.320 --> 02:10:15.720
Y: this is it, it's right thing.

02:10:16.360 --> 02:10:17.440
SM: That's true but you should see yourself.

02:10:17.960 --> 02:10:20.760
You see that  if you somebody talks on a mental level

02:10:21.520 --> 02:10:23.600
gives no experience of respect.

02:10:24.120 --> 02:10:26.440
you have to be collectively conscious, Christ has said,one thing,

02:10:26.920 --> 02:10:29.760
Your hands must speak, just go and ask them, they talk of Christ.

02:10:30.560 --> 02:10:33.080
Are your hands speaking, Are their hands speaking.

02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:35.800
Christ has said, is it? And he said,

02:10:36.280 --> 02:10:37.200
that I will send you a comforter,

02:10:37.680 --> 02:10:39.240
who will make you know your father better.

02:10:40.160 --> 02:10:42.520
Not this knowledge, what is the use of knowing everything

02:10:43.040 --> 02:10:44.840
about everything but not about your own father.

02:10:46.560 --> 02:10:49.120
Not so sure shot to argue with,

02:10:49.680 --> 02:10:51.400
And then what about your own powers.

02:10:51.880 --> 02:10:53.840
Do they give you any powers? Do you feel anything.

02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:56.440
Can you understand anything, can you do anything?

02:10:56.960 --> 02:10:58.120
Can you give realization to any one.Y: I do understand.

02:11:01.560 --> 02:11:03.200
No no what do they develop?

02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:05.840
You see what I am saying, they don't develop anything.

02:11:06.360 --> 02:11:09.120
not a single person, who can say, I can give self realization.

02:11:09.720 --> 02:11:12.560
Isn't it, in the rusilation, not a single person.

02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:16.440
It's not a single guru, who says I will give you realization.

02:11:16.920 --> 02:11:18.800
Not a single guru, that one thing is sure.

02:11:19.640 --> 02:11:22.720
They talk of it but they never say we will give you realization.

02:11:25.680 --> 02:11:26.560
Beg a pardon.

02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:33.480
He says the guru, the guru will guide you.

02:11:33.960 --> 02:11:35.560
That you can find it yourself.

02:11:35.920 --> 02:11:37.680
You see, the question is  if

02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:40.160
we have to find it ourselves we don't need a guru.Why ?

02:11:46.280 --> 02:11:48.440
They are all using your naiveness, you see.

02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:50.680
Because, you don't know

02:11:51.240 --> 02:11:52.840
if you were an Indian you would have known

02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:54.880
that you have to have an enlighten soul.

02:11:55.960 --> 02:11:57.560
Who is a guru, to give you realization.

02:11:59.000 --> 02:12:00.880
But you, these people can also say that

02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:03.200
Oh see we are, we don't believe in guru,

02:12:03.800 --> 02:12:04.600
some say we believe in guru.

02:12:05.160 --> 02:12:07.080
Means you believe in the enlighten one.

02:12:07.480 --> 02:12:09.040
Who are not not in the point, what is an

02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:11.520
The interest of an enlighten one is to see that

02:12:12.120 --> 02:12:13.280
to get your realization.

02:12:13.800 --> 02:12:17.200
The guidance they give you is what? Nothing just talking about it.

02:12:17.720 --> 02:12:19.800
And talking about, it has been done since ages.

02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:22.920
Now your fore fathers and your fathers

02:12:23.520 --> 02:12:24.320
Fore father's and their fore fathers and fathers

02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:26.960
have talked and talked and talked.

02:12:27.760 --> 02:12:29.280
As time for your hand to talk.

02:12:29.840 --> 02:12:33.280
All right, this is what, your hands must

02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:35.840
Now see you come

02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:38.680
To ring, they feel it, so we say yet it's not done.

02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:41.880
We don't say you have got it, we don't say that.

02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:44.880
We say it's not done. It's not done, it's not done.

02:12:45.760 --> 02:12:47.160
When it is done ,it will be done.

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:49.160
You see we cannot see that.

02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:51.840
Because you have come here, you will have it.

02:12:52.360 --> 02:12:54.280
Isn't it, we can't just say, of course we will work it out.

02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:56.840
We will work it out, you will work it out, lets see.

02:12:57.640 --> 02:12:59.800
When it will work out, will work out, all right.

02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:03.560
It is like this, it is not that just you become a member something.

02:13:04.120 --> 02:13:06.480
or you go to a lecture you become Roosy Croosy

02:13:07.720 --> 02:13:08.760
How can you become?

02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:15.280
That's, that's what I am telling you.

02:13:15.760 --> 02:13:17.400
You must  know that you have not become anything.

02:13:17.880 --> 02:13:19.680
You have been just listening to their acrobats.

02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:24.000
intellectual acrobat, this is not there.

02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:27.040
Y: Vibration to everything.SM:  What you have to have

02:13:27.800 --> 02:13:32.120
is to get yourself the power."

02:13:32.640 --> 02:13:35.280
Your own power, your spirit must manifest.

02:13:36.280 --> 02:13:38.840
Are you manifesting? Not!  SM: Then finished.

02:13:40.240 --> 02:13:42.160
That should be their criteria, all right

02:13:42.760 --> 02:13:43.800
They may say I am true, I am true

02:13:44.240 --> 02:13:45.800
but who gives you the coffee is the one

02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:48.080
If they will say, I will give you coffee

02:13:48.560 --> 02:13:49.960
He just give you an empty cup.

02:13:50.480 --> 02:13:53.840
Then won't you, won't you think that oh God!

02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:55.960
This is an empty cup not a coffee.

02:13:56.600 --> 02:13:59.160
So the proof of the pudding is in the eating of it, as they say

02:13:59.680 --> 02:14:02.600
What powers did you get?

02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:05.160
You must express your powers.

02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:08.160
You must, while all these people are saying, we are manifesting.

02:14:10.880 --> 02:14:12.880
None of them would say because they are not.

02:14:14.720 --> 02:14:15.800
One gentleman came and told Me, Mother

02:14:16.400 --> 02:14:19.760
I am self realised person and I am a twice born.

02:14:20.320 --> 02:14:22.400
I said, " All right, just tell Me, where is your Kundalini?"

02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:25.760
He said, I don't know, where is the Kundalini of this person.

02:14:26.720 --> 02:14:29.160
Where is your blockage, where is the blockage of this person?

02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:32.200
That I don't know, Then you are suppose to be useful for what?

02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:35.200
See if I say there is light in this room,

02:14:35.560 --> 02:14:37.120
you should be able to see

02:14:42.960 --> 02:14:45.360
Y: Either all this is illusion, SM: all illusion.

02:14:46.200 --> 02:14:49.240
They are all illusions, all they, they are very illusive

02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:52.040
They live in the illusion, I don't know why?

02:14:52.600 --> 02:14:55.040
And the end of this ....is disastrous

02:14:56.960 --> 02:14:59.040
I don't mind if they carry on with the illusion only,

02:14:59.600 --> 02:15:01.920
it is disastrous, see now you have been there

02:15:02.400 --> 02:15:04.760
that's why your avoid caught up.

02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:06.960
I mean you would have been realized in no time

02:15:07.520 --> 02:15:08.400
because you are a seeker but

02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:10.680
because the void is caught you are taking time, isn't it?

02:15:11.240 --> 02:15:12.600
So in a way they have harmed you

02:15:14.680 --> 02:15:17.080
even if you won't get involved you will get harmed.

02:15:17.840 --> 02:15:20.560
This is it, that's why I am very up set them.

02:15:21.160 --> 02:15:22.600
They want to make money, they can

02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:24.640
They deceive,you see, they can be burglars.

02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:26.680
That's easier way to make money.

02:15:27.200 --> 02:15:29.600
Not very difficult, why to make all this fuss.

02:15:33.520 --> 02:15:36.920
All right, you keep it here, Now. Y: Somebody wants this.

02:15:37.480 --> 02:15:40.480
SM; Sugar.Y: There is extra sugar, somebody ?

02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:52.240
Y: Anybody else with. SM: What's your name?

02:15:53.120 --> 02:15:54.160
Y: Anything to vibrate.

02:15:55.840 --> 02:15:58.960
Better now, think before, that you have to decide about marriage.

02:15:59.240 --> 02:16:00.960
Marry now, thirty two, when will you marry?

02:16:03.320 --> 02:16:05.480
You have to have some great people being  born.

02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:08.720
on this earth, some great saint have to be born.

02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:10.960
Hum, all right.

02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:16.480
Yes, good news, Armu's wife is going to have a baby.

02:16:24.520 --> 02:16:25.760
How happy they feel you know.

02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:30.160
He is a swiss gentleman......

02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:51.640
I think she came to see here if you are brown...

02:16:52.240 --> 02:16:53.280
Y: it's clear not.

02:16:55.720 --> 02:16:56.520
How she came here your sister,

02:16:57.040 --> 02:17:00.240
you see like a great patroange angel.

02:17:10.080 --> 02:17:13.640
I don't know if that is so, how can she enjoy.

02:17:14.240 --> 02:17:15.280
If she has not touched My spirit.

02:17:16.320 --> 02:17:17.960
See she should be anxious to touch the spirit.

02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:20.000
But I think she is not a seeker at all.

02:17:20.560 --> 02:17:24.600
Y: She is. SM: She is, you think so.

02:17:25.640 --> 02:17:26.760
Try to bring her now.

02:17:27.360 --> 02:17:31.960
Put her left to the right.

02:17:36.200 --> 02:17:37.560
I wish you luck.

02:17:40.640 --> 02:17:42.600
She should, I mean she should really come and enjoy but

02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:44.480
But there is no, she was in a very arrogant mood,

02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:46.720
she came here and I can see her.

02:17:50.600 --> 02:17:53.800
So it's over, can I make a move.

02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:59.400
Still little more  more.

02:18:00.040 --> 02:18:03.760
What you do you get vibrated for everyone in a big way.

02:18:04.320 --> 02:18:06.280
and give it to them if they need it.You see, I will be moving now.

02:18:06.880 --> 02:18:07.720
Out of London.

02:18:16.200 --> 02:18:17.160
How are you now.

02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:21.760
Looking very much better.

02:18:22.800 --> 02:18:25.520
Very much better, that anemic look has gone now.

02:18:25.800 --> 02:18:27.680
You don't look anemic any more.

02:18:28.720 --> 02:18:31.920
You have left Nabhi.You have  left Nabhi problem.

02:18:35.080 --> 02:18:36.400
Also left Nabhi ....

02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:40.680
It's all.

02:18:51.680 --> 02:18:53.320
I don't feel guilty at all, do you?

02:19:00.400 --> 02:19:03.880
For what? if you had  done anything that great.

02:19:04.520 --> 02:19:06.680
Leave off, you could never have got realization.

02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:08.320
So why to feel guilty?

02:19:10.320 --> 02:19:11.480
Just come here, come!

02:19:48.800 --> 02:19:49.560
Better now?

02:19:53.800 --> 02:19:55.120
Yes, better?

02:20:00.520 --> 02:20:03.520
Happening, Much better.

02:20:09.120 --> 02:20:11.600
How are you? All right.

02:20:14.360 --> 02:20:15.760
These are the best lemons.

02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:17.920
You see, they suck your vibrations very fast.

02:20:19.000 --> 02:20:21.000
These are little high breed the other one are.

02:20:21.360 --> 02:20:23.920
These are normal, these are normal, I think.

02:20:24.360 --> 02:20:25.880
They are very good.

02:20:32.320 --> 02:20:35.160
I am sorry I have leave early because it's already quite late.

02:20:35.720 --> 02:20:37.360
They must be waiting

02:20:43.480 --> 02:20:45.240
Sunday morning, no

02:20:45.800 --> 02:20:48.080
saturday evening, we are going.

02:20:48.680 --> 02:20:51.240
Saturday morning I would like to go and buy some flowers for them.

02:20:52.040 --> 02:20:56.600
Or if somebody could go to the flower shop.

02:20:57.200 --> 02:20:58.520
You can take our three four boxes

02:20:59.000 --> 02:20:59.960
with  us in the plane.

02:21:03.080 --> 02:21:04.360

02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:22.440

All right, we have to work and you have to work.

Can have matka.

02:25:04.560 --> 02:25:05.320
All right.

02:25:16.560 --> 02:25:18.200
It's from both the Ashrams, we have got this.

02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:22.800
Now for our traveling as you know.

02:25:25.640 --> 02:25:28.600
You have got all the papers, how much, how much do we have.

02:25:29.600 --> 02:25:31.920
Y: I don't know how much was in before but.

02:25:32.520 --> 02:25:34.800
There was four hundred nineteen ideen... cash now,

02:25:35.360 --> 02:25:38.200
There is Cheque of five  hundred and eight.

02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:47.440
He told Me there is thousand five hundred.

02:25:48.040 --> 02:25:50.600
Y: Yes Mother all together, all together.

02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:52.320
Y: There is about four hundred.

02:25:56.600 --> 02:25:57.960
It is Kumkum will be vibrated.

02:25:59.280 --> 02:26:02.560
Just but they do it, you see, Indians are very plastic minded.

02:26:04.280 --> 02:26:06.560
Horrible, It's beyond Me.

02:26:27.160 --> 02:26:28.640
I wouldn't brought a pen or anything.

02:26:32.120 --> 02:26:34.560
All five minutes in the room, what had happened, How are you?

02:26:37.200 --> 02:26:38.400
SM: Better now.Y: Yes Mam.

02:26:43.720 --> 02:26:45.160
Put it in a proper thing you know.

02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:54.840
From plastic to plastic.

02:27:05.480 --> 02:27:08.600
But dust can disappear into dust but plastic cannot.

02:27:18.160 --> 02:27:21.040
I don't understand why should they put Kumkum in a plastic thing.

02:27:21.520 --> 02:27:23.120
It is just can't understand, stupid people

02:27:24.360 --> 02:27:26.920
Hum hum, very good peas.

02:27:27.520 --> 02:27:29.440
Who's done, you bought this

02:27:31.320 --> 02:27:33.880
Yogini, It was here in the Ashram, I don't know who got that.

02:27:35.280 --> 02:27:37.760
Is it, done beautifully.

02:27:39.640 --> 02:27:41.760
Nice thing they do, it's very nice.

02:27:44.160 --> 02:27:45.480
Its for pouring water or what?

02:27:48.440 --> 02:27:49.280
Y: Ya. SM: Is it?

02:27:54.200 --> 02:27:55.120
It was in the Ashram

02:28:00.960 --> 02:28:02.400
How are you, good, I am very happy.

02:28:03.440 --> 02:28:05.240
She is doing well, she is doing very well.

02:28:06.040 --> 02:28:09.400
Yogini: Mother I want one suggestion from you.

02:28:09.960 --> 02:28:15.720
I  have been actually, this was guru, who gave the mantra.

02:28:16.360 --> 02:28:18.960
So I want to just to say that, how what should I

02:28:19.440 --> 02:28:21.880
I don't actually chant the mantra now.

02:28:22.480 --> 02:28:24.640
Since I have SM: You don't.

02:28:25.560 --> 02:28:27.680
Now but... Mother: What is his name?

02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:32.200
Hari, Hari, Shri Hari Maharaj.

02:28:33.000 --> 02:28:34.560
Where does he live? Yogini: Jalandher.

02:28:38.560 --> 02:28:40.720
Does he take any money? Yogini: No, nothing.

02:28:41.440 --> 02:28:43.720
Yogini: No, it is not an institute, I mean it's just a...

02:28:44.320 --> 02:28:45.320
He lives in someone's house

02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:49.040
and everybody goes there and do meditation.

02:28:51.560 --> 02:28:53.600
It is coming but don't understand how come he gave you mantra.

02:28:54.280 --> 02:28:57.280
He shouldn't give you  mantra.Yogini: This is what he...

02:28:58.160 --> 02:29:01.520
Satnam, satnam, He only chants this day and night.

02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:03.960
He looks realized.

02:29:04.680 --> 02:29:07.600
SM: He seems to be realized. Yogini: Is he a great one?

02:29:08.520 --> 02:29:10.680
SM: He doesn't seem to be a great one but he is a realized soul.

02:29:11.480 --> 02:29:13.960
Yogini: OK, then me and my husband

02:29:14.640 --> 02:29:16.840
chant their mantra.

02:29:18.040 --> 02:29:20.480
Mantra is not right thing.OK, show him My photo.

02:29:20.960 --> 02:29:23.360
He will understand, he is realized.

02:29:26.680 --> 02:29:28.600
Just realized guru.

02:29:29.160 --> 02:29:31.280
At last, at long last.

02:29:33.240 --> 02:29:34.840
But he has no institution, takes no money.

02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:36.960
Fine, you see he doesn't take any money institutionally

02:29:37.440 --> 02:29:38.280
He lives in somebody's house.

02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:39.920
Very simple man, that's what she is saying

02:29:40.440 --> 02:29:42.320
but mantra he cannot should  not give,

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:44.320
Though whatever mantra he has given you

02:29:44.840 --> 02:29:46.760
is awaken mantra, no doubt because he is realized soul.

02:29:47.440 --> 02:29:49.840
He should not, because you stuck up with that.

02:29:50.520 --> 02:29:51.760
You see these realized soul also don't

02:29:52.440 --> 02:29:53.400
that you people are not even realized.

02:29:54.840 --> 02:29:55.960
Then they give you mantra.That's the problem.

02:29:59.640 --> 02:30:02.480
So I haven't since stop saying mantra. SM: You just

02:30:03.200 --> 02:30:04.880
SM: You don't need, now you become the guru,

02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:09.400
Isn't it, now you become the guru."

02:30:10.480 --> 02:30:11.320
You will know the mantras now.

02:30:11.840 --> 02:30:13.320
now you will know what mantra's to be done, for whom?

02:30:13.920 --> 02:30:15.960
Why should you take any mantra from anyone anymore?

02:30:17.040 --> 02:30:18.560
SM: To a unrealized soul you should, never give a manta

02:30:19.280 --> 02:30:21.080
to begin with and one mantra is not going to work it out.

02:30:21.600 --> 02:30:23.520
And now a days the Kundalini doesn't move.

02:30:25.440 --> 02:30:26.600
Satnam is only for Vishuddhi.

02:30:28.400 --> 02:30:31.040
What about, other Chakras.Yogini: It means Satnam can be recited

02:30:31.960 --> 02:30:34.080
. SM: Yes, You can say Twemev Sakshaat Satnam...

02:30:34.680 --> 02:30:37.240
if you say it is all right, that's a truthful name.

02:30:37.880 --> 02:30:40.360
You can say but that will open your Vishuddhi.

02:30:42.640 --> 02:30:44.440
Hum.. better vibrations.

02:30:48.840 --> 02:30:51.360
That's Satnam means true names

02:30:52.840 --> 02:30:54.840
SM: Yes. Y: Every where Satnam.

02:31:16.120 --> 02:31:18.040
Somebody will pick Me up on saturday.

02:31:22.040 --> 02:31:24.200
I mean, somebody has to just come, we have a car.

02:31:25.360 --> 02:31:27.160
But only problem is that somebody has to come.

02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:36.720
Buy flower, saturday is it open, the flower shop.

02:31:38.640 --> 02:31:39.800
The big play.

02:31:44.880 --> 02:31:49.080
You can go and buy, then pay you.
