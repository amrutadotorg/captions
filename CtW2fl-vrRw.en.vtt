2001-04-01

00:00:00.286 --> 00:00:04.772
Dear viewer, now there are the message of happiness
 from a guest coming from India.

00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:10.126
Indian Yoga Master Shri Mataji tells those who are 
suffering from the economic crisis to have patience.

00:00:10.142 --> 00:00:12.954
She gives good news that very soon Turkey
 will come out of the crisis

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:18.100
and adds, do not worry, 
after all you have a dervish guiding you.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.105
Dervish,

00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:22.751
 Dervish mean sufi.

00:00:23.307 --> 00:00:27.785
She is a world renowend Yoga Master,
 the founder of a tecnique called Sahaja.

00:00:27.805 --> 00:00:31.187
She introduce Herself with the word Sufi meaning Dervish

00:00:31.211 --> 00:00:33.975
and She has tens of thousands followers.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.113
Shri Mataji is now in Istanbul.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.634
I received an education in medicine in India.

00:00:39.659 --> 00:00:42.335
In 1970, I discovered Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.901
From that day on, I am travelling
 all over the world to explain it.

00:00:47.293 --> 00:00:50.431
She promeses endless happiness to the people,

00:00:50.456 --> 00:00:53.665
 going to every part of the world,
 She gives the message of self realization.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.799
Acoording to Her, realization means to awaken
 the hidden energy in the body

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:01.327
and to open the way to spirituel growth.

00:01:01.597 --> 00:01:04.296
People who seek the truth come to me.

00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:08.197
Gandhi was also a Sufi and 
jelaous people finished him.

00:01:08.222 --> 00:01:11.907
My mission is to find new sufis 
and to open the way for them.

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:16.330
The reason why Shri Mataji comes often  to  Turkey
 is that Turks are give importance to spirituel world

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:19.188
and She is even aware of the economical crisis in Turkey.

00:01:19.213 --> 00:01:22.453
She loves Ataturk whom 
She knows from Her childhood.

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:25.036
Ataturk was also very great leader,

00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:27.530
he removed all the nonsensical obstacles.

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:30.851
Thanks to him, you Turks are very talented

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:34.872
but he had too many enemies that is
 why he was very unhappy.

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:38.329
She says that the difficult days in Turkey 
will be finished soon

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:41.198
because there is someone like Dervish
 in the head of economy.

00:01:41.223 --> 00:01:45.168
Just looking his photo She understands
 that he will be succesful.

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:48.338
The word Dervish is coming from Sufism

00:01:48.363 --> 00:01:49.959
and that makes him amiable,

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:53.255
as far as I can see, he works 
very hard and from his heart

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.235
and he looks like a very good man

00:01:55.251 --> 00:01:57.364
but because of this extreme working pace,

00:01:57.389 --> 00:01:59.610
he may get heart problems or asthma.

00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:03.056
Because of that his heart center gets tired very much.

00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.092
Regarding the economic crisis,
She says, be patient,

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:07.317
accoding to Her, health is of primary importance.

00:02:07.334 --> 00:02:10.518
Don`t make yourself sick being
 affected by the crisis.

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:14.847
Only way out of the crisis you are in,
 is to love your country,

00:02:14.872 --> 00:02:18.169
besides there is a turmoil 
and thay may cause you a lot of harm.

00:02:18.194 --> 00:02:22.148
Only those who realy  love their country
 can prevent this turmoil.

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:25.718
When I was young, I also went out to the streets
 for the independence of India.

00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:27.019
I was imprisoned

00:02:27.044 --> 00:02:28.792
but I forgive everyone.

00:02:28.836 --> 00:02:32.120
Besides, too much running after 
money cannot make one happy,

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.750
it will only create problems.

00:02:34.832 --> 00:02:38.024
For those who believe in Shri Mataji, She is Holy

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.606
and those who live according to Her teachings are
 considered protected against evil.

00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:46.101
This is also true for all other religions.

00:02:46.137 --> 00:02:48.646
The essence of all religions are the same

00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:51.792
but mullahs and priests changed it.

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:54.635
There is one God we all believe in

00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:59.060
but He has different hands and 
we believe in the evolution of people.

00:02:59.085 --> 00:03:03.080
People ascend slowly and teachers
 show the way to them.

00:03:03.105 --> 00:03:07.269
Prophet Muhammad was such a Teacher.

00:03:07.548 --> 00:03:11.984
On Tuesday Shri Mataji will meet those who
 interested in Yoga  at Lutfi Kirdar hall.
