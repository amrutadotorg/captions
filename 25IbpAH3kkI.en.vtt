WEBVTT

00:04.530 --> 00:16.602
Today we all Sahaja Yogis are standing
on the brink of the ocean,

00:17.832 --> 00:22.164
ocean of humanity,

00:24.161 --> 00:32.643
where we have to face the problems
of human beings.

00:32.844 --> 00:38.983
Otherwise, in the nature there are no
problems, they are all already solved.

00:41.574 --> 00:44.738
So one has to understand that

00:44.939 --> 00:55.656
it’s not just a movement of few people,
chosen people,

00:55.857 --> 01:01.209
just to achieve Self-realisation,

01:01.409 --> 01:06.779
but it’s a big revolution

01:08.344 --> 01:14.268
which has to bring forth the beauties
of human beings,

01:14.448 --> 01:23.460
the glories of human beings, the proof
of divinity,

01:23.660 --> 01:30.017
of divine power and of God Almighty.

01:30.871 --> 01:35.602
We have to now face that multitude
of people

01:35.803 --> 01:39.988
who are absolutely ignorant compared
to you,

01:40.189 --> 01:43.856
who have not known the knowledge of God,

01:44.057 --> 01:53.608
who are either lost into the darkness
of ignorance

01:53.809 --> 02:00.625
or are burning in the fire of ego.

02:04.388 --> 02:09.386
We have to transform this world into
a new world,

02:09.587 --> 02:17.561
a beautiful world which you all are
enjoying,

02:17.773 --> 02:25.537
to establish it, to be established on this
earth,

02:25.738 --> 02:29.672
for which we have to prepare ourselves.

02:29.873 --> 02:33.497
So far Sahaj Yoga means blessings;

02:33.698 --> 02:38.993
if somebody is less blessed they ask Me
questions, “How is it, Mother,

02:39.194 --> 02:42.341
we haven’t got this when we are praying
to You?

02:42.542 --> 02:44.722
Why did it not work out?

02:44.923 --> 02:48.648
It should have happened, after all we
are worshipping You,

02:48.849 --> 02:54.850
so how is it that my son did not get
the job?”

02:58.141 --> 03:02.340
So, I mean, as if it’s sort of a, some
debts have to be paid

03:02.541 --> 03:06.115
to all the Sahaja Yogis by Sahaj Yoga.

03:06.316 --> 03:13.060
That sort of an attitude has been, so far,
towards Sahaj Yog.

03:13.672 --> 03:18.447
Of, not all of you, I must say,

03:19.085 --> 03:27.002
but in the minds there’s lurking always,
a desire to know

03:27.203 --> 03:32.989
why, when we are Sahaj Yogis, why should
it happen to us.

03:33.190 --> 03:37.162
You’ve seen that God has blessed you.

03:37.350 --> 03:43.349
Some people had very miserable married
life,

03:43.515 --> 03:48.700
they couldn’t understand why they had
to have a miserable married life.

03:48.900 --> 03:53.585
Some had some misfortunes

03:53.786 --> 04:00.351
and some had some diseases also after
coming to Sahaj Yoga.

04:00.508 --> 04:05.756
So there has to be understanding that
Sahaj Yoga is

04:05.957 --> 04:13.311
for correcting your life, for putting you
on solid basis,

04:13.488 --> 04:18.896
on proper foundations to make you
great people.

04:19.097 --> 04:24.088
As if it gets you immuned to all these
mishappenings,

04:24.281 --> 04:29.561
with blessings of course, so you don’t feel
the effects

04:29.785 --> 04:35.491
of those misfortunes so much as you would
normally feel.

04:35.692 --> 04:41.755
This creates beautiful human beings out
of you.

04:41.956 --> 04:45.879
Some people have hankering after money;

04:46.080 --> 04:50.043
some people think they can make money
by coming to Sahaj Yoga;

04:50.244 --> 04:56.070
some people think they will become leaders
or some think they will have fame,

04:56.271 --> 05:03.593
some think that they will achieve a kind
of a very dominant position;

05:03.793 --> 05:08.299
and some think that they can befool Me
also.

05:13.048 --> 05:17.969
It’s high time we realise that Sahaj Yoga
is not for this.

05:18.170 --> 05:21.952
Sahaj Yoga is for making you the wisest
person,

05:22.153 --> 05:29.449
the sanest person, the most generous and
the most confident person in the world,

05:29.649 --> 05:32.460
because you have to fight,

05:32.661 --> 05:36.978
you have to fight the dark ignorance
of Kali Yuga,

05:37.163 --> 05:44.612
of ages which is precipitated and today
we see all the bad effects of it.

05:45.452 --> 05:48.931
Whatever you may call it, you may call it
the fanaticism,

05:49.141 --> 05:54.549
you may call it the atheism, any isms
of any kinds,

05:54.750 --> 06:02.308
and all these human projections which
have created

06:02.509 --> 06:06.547
all those artificial webs have to be
broken.

06:06.782 --> 06:15.103
But human beings, on the whole, believe
that these artificial webs are real.

06:15.406 --> 06:17.933
So to break that,

06:18.134 --> 06:22.988
you have to be also be careful that you
don’t break the human beings.

06:23.188 --> 06:26.350
While you are breaking their false faiths,

06:26.533 --> 06:32.468
you have to remember that those people
who are carrying those false faiths

06:32.669 --> 06:38.127
are the ones who have to achieve
Self-realisation.

06:38.328 --> 06:44.346
It’s a very delicate work, it’s a very hard
work, it’s a very harsh work

06:44.547 --> 06:48.832
but it is the most detached work.

06:49.033 --> 06:53.281
And when we realise that we are
so important,

06:53.482 --> 06:58.804
that God has blessed us with this peace,

06:59.005 --> 07:03.757
with this understanding, with these
powers -

07:03.957 --> 07:07.917
it’s not only for our own gain,

07:08.117 --> 07:14.707
because God is not only for you, He is
for the whole world.

07:14.908 --> 07:18.089
So we have to utilise them, we have
to spread them,

07:18.290 --> 07:23.589
work it out at every level; we have
to become dynamic about it.

07:23.790 --> 07:26.142
But the most important thing is
the responsibility

07:26.343 --> 07:30.224
of Sahaj Yoga we have to take.

07:30.692 --> 07:36.101
We are Sahaj Yogis and we are responsible
for Sahaj Yoga.

07:36.302 --> 07:39.170
What have we done for Sahaj Yoga?

07:39.370 --> 07:42.473
We looked after our family, our children,
our jobs,

07:42.674 --> 07:49.561
our this, our that, motorcars, our horses,
our dogs, our cats.

07:50.352 --> 07:54.670
But who is responsible for Sahaj Yoga?

07:56.507 --> 07:59.659
When it comes to that point, we are
responsible

07:59.850 --> 08:04.951
of Sahaj Yoga, then it works out.

08:40.942 --> 08:48.440
But there is a deliberate action also
of the negative forces.

08:48.641 --> 08:54.183
And this negativity is acting through
ignorant people who believe,

08:54.383 --> 08:56.960
who believe that they are right.

08:57.160 --> 09:01.414
They don’t know what is waiting for their
destruction there.

09:01.614 --> 09:08.081
Specially among our young people
you’ll find

09:08.281 --> 09:14.631
they just join any party, join any club,

09:14.832 --> 09:18.849
join any methods, any trend, anything,

09:19.050 --> 09:28.830
just because they have no understanding
as to what they have to be.

09:29.923 --> 09:33.534
They have to be the Spirit.

09:33.734 --> 09:38.642
I asked the other day a president of
a young organisation,

09:38.842 --> 09:42.783
“What is your policy?” He said,
“We have no policy.”

09:42.984 --> 09:46.460
They started looking here and there, [and]
said, “We have no policy.”

09:46.661 --> 09:51.177
I was amazed that they have no policy.

09:51.377 --> 09:55.645
“No, whatever our leaders say, we do it.”

09:55.845 --> 10:00.594
So to get people out of this kind
of slavery

10:00.795 --> 10:05.997
that they have no brains of their own,
they can’t use their own understanding,

10:06.197 --> 10:10.336
they have to become the Spirit.

10:10.675 --> 10:16.325
Shivaji who was a great Atma Sakshatkari,
a realised soul,

10:16.526 --> 10:18.943
for the future he has given the message.

10:19.117 --> 10:28.423
He said, “Svadharma jagwawa,” means
enlighten your dharma of Spirit.

10:28.624 --> 10:35.528
“Svadharma,” the Spirit has to be
enlightened.

10:36.560 --> 10:40.455
Everybody has said that. I’m specially
quoting him

10:40.655 --> 10:46.308
because he comes from Maharashtra; apart
from that he was a political head.

10:46.509 --> 10:50.993
Though he was a political head but because
he was a realised soul,

10:51.193 --> 10:56.193
he said that your Spirit should be
awakened.

10:56.393 --> 11:00.259
He didn’t talk of all other nonsensical
things.

11:00.460 --> 11:04.374
And he knew that unless and until
the Spirit is awakened,

11:04.575 --> 11:09.379
people will be doing all kinds of wrong
things.

11:09.580 --> 11:12.854
And that is why today we find all over
the world

11:13.054 --> 11:15.692
the mess in which all political parties,

11:15.892 --> 11:22.714
all economic endeavours, all military
endeavours have fallen into.

11:23.293 --> 11:31.901
So, it is for us to take over and to show
them what is an integrated life,

11:32.107 --> 11:39.142
and what is the strength of a human being.

11:39.343 --> 11:43.067
Because this Shakti is within everyone.

11:43.267 --> 11:47.901
Just praying to Shakti, just talking about
Shakti, it doesn’t act.

11:48.102 --> 11:57.179
But this divine Shakti has to act, and
act through you people.

11:58.052 --> 12:00.796
Just try to realise

12:00.997 --> 12:08.112
that within these few years how much
knowledge you have got,

12:09.805 --> 12:14.506
how much you know, how deeply you know.

12:14.707 --> 12:17.535
You are not just passing slogans
or talking, you know -

12:17.736 --> 12:22.250
but you know it, you know
what it is.

12:22.415 --> 12:25.938
I don’t think I have attended to each
one of you individually,

12:26.139 --> 12:29.093
but through your Spirit only you have
come to know

12:29.294 --> 12:32.818
all the knowledge about yourself and
knowledge about others.

12:33.019 --> 12:38.045
You didn’t have to go to any library, you
didn’t have to go to any university.

12:38.246 --> 12:40.330
All the saints never went,

12:40.531 --> 12:44.553
none of the saints went to any university
or read any books,

12:44.754 --> 12:49.134
but how knowledgeable they were, because
they were the Spirit.

12:49.335 --> 12:53.486
So the first and foremost responsibility
of a Sahaj Yogi

12:53.687 --> 12:58.935
on this day is to be the Spirit, on the day
when we are celebrating

12:59.136 --> 13:04.243
the birthday of Christ, who was the Spirit.

13:05.705 --> 13:09.405
So, this is our greatest responsibility
first to see that,

13:09.606 --> 13:17.287
“Are we the Spirit, or we are this body,
this mind, this ego? What are we?”

13:17.968 --> 13:22.697
If you have achieved that state,

13:23.459 --> 13:27.565
if you have achieved that state,

13:27.766 --> 13:31.281
then you are, as they call in Marathi,
samarthya,

13:31.482 --> 13:41.527
means, you are equal to your name;
that you are the Spirit.

13:42.601 --> 13:45.908
If you cannot achieve that,

13:46.109 --> 13:49.815
then you are a half-baked Sahaj Yogi,
not yet done.

13:50.022 --> 13:54.881
As you know, we have no organisations,
no memberships, nothing.

13:55.082 --> 14:03.687
But we have one thing, that we know
we are realised souls,

14:04.179 --> 14:11.310
that we know more than all others know,
and that we are not proud of it.

14:11.511 --> 14:15.043
We are very humble people.

14:15.208 --> 14:22.079
But this humility should not become
a stagnation or a lethargy within us that,

14:22.280 --> 14:29.713
“Now we are realised souls, let us sit
on a tree and have our blessings.”

14:33.581 --> 14:37.375
You have to get to the roots

14:37.606 --> 14:41.551
and you all have to work it out
on your level.

14:41.752 --> 14:45.256
But first get rid of your own personal
problems,

14:45.457 --> 14:49.512
all petty things that you have.

14:50.694 --> 14:53.462
When we talk of sacrifice, as you know,

14:53.663 --> 14:59.301
in Sahaj Yoga I have not known what
sacrifice people have done.

14:59.502 --> 15:03.696
You have to sacrifice your ego,

15:03.897 --> 15:08.331
which is a headache to you and to Me.

15:08.531 --> 15:11.038
And you have to sacrifice your
conditioning,

15:11.239 --> 15:16.295
only two things, left and right.

15:17.189 --> 15:21.227
And that can be achieved and many
have achieved [it],

15:21.428 --> 15:28.703
but now put that detached personality
to a test.

15:28.904 --> 15:34.394
And then, once you are sure that you
are detached,

15:34.659 --> 15:39.522
then employ your energy in doing

15:39.723 --> 15:49.586
constructive improvement of this whole
world.

15:49.935 --> 15:55.042
It will work out for poverty, it will
work out for politics,

15:55.243 --> 16:04.210
it will work out for economics, it will
work out for every field of life.

16:05.061 --> 16:11.017
Sahaj Yoga is the only solution because
in this human beings are transformed.

16:11.218 --> 16:18.387
It’s not like this, that one person changes
the address

16:18.609 --> 16:24.614
or the badge that he is wearing, and he
becomes something else.

16:24.815 --> 16:30.309
Or from church to temple and temple
to church.

16:30.539 --> 16:36.380
It’s something within that transforms you,
makes you knowledgeable.

16:36.595 --> 16:42.385
So you are already Sat Chit Ananda; because
you know the truth,

16:42.586 --> 16:50.586
you are in joy and your attention
is enlightened.

16:51.937 --> 16:59.205
With all this that you have, what are we
to do now?

17:01.105 --> 17:05.147
If you enlighten the light, it
automatically knows

17:05.348 --> 17:09.418
that it has to give the light.

17:11.610 --> 17:16.908
In the same way, all the Sahaj Yogis
have to take the responsibility

17:17.109 --> 17:22.533
for this great war we have started.

17:22.734 --> 17:33.790
It’s not the war with swords or with
atomic energies,

17:34.115 --> 17:38.450
because they are all destructive.

17:38.607 --> 17:43.259
This is the war against all the destructive
powers

17:43.460 --> 17:47.541
through the power of love which is
constructive,

17:47.742 --> 17:52.092
which constructs human beings, which
constructs societies,

17:52.293 --> 17:58.472
which constructs countries and the whole
world.

18:01.940 --> 18:06.656
That is your own

18:08.235 --> 18:13.392
and also this decision has to be your own.

18:13.593 --> 18:17.835
Even if I give big lectures and say things,

18:18.036 --> 18:22.143
it may not have any effect whatsoever
on you.

18:22.344 --> 18:24.977
It might be just wasted,

18:25.178 --> 18:31.700
if you haven’t got the capacity to imbibe
what I am saying,

18:31.901 --> 18:39.219
so important, so imminent.

18:39.434 --> 18:41.765
Now give up all the worries you have about

18:41.966 --> 18:45.114
your small, small, little, little things
of your family,

18:45.315 --> 18:48.488
of your work, your factories,

18:48.689 --> 18:54.890
of your business, of your official
positions

18:55.091 --> 19:02.504
and just know that everything has to go
through Sahaj Yoga.

19:03.720 --> 19:10.422
Even the cooking I do, I do it through
Sahaj.

19:10.623 --> 19:15.895
If the fire is not working, just put your
hands to the fire, it becomes all right.

19:16.096 --> 19:22.004
If the rice is not cooking, put your hands
to the rice, it cooks.

19:22.205 --> 19:26.859
Anything going wrong anywhere, you can
use your vibrations.

19:27.060 --> 19:34.799
But I don’t know what to use to make you
feel responsible for Sahaj Yoga,

19:35.000 --> 19:39.087
that now we’ve got such a great thing
with us

19:39.288 --> 19:43.163
and what are we going to do about it.
