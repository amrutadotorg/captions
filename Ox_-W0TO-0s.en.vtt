1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560
a great blessing to you, then must know how to preserve it, must know how to enhance it,

2
00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.160
must know how to enjoy it.

3
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:20.160
You should not just get satisfied with one, you can say, one dance, drama or one this

4
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.640
thing, one that.

5
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:31.180
But you should have a full oneness with the Divine, full oneness and that is possible

6
00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.780
only if you really meditate, which is quite a easy thing to do, to meditate is.

7
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.560
Some people say, Mother we cannot get over time, we cannot think, we are all the time

8
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.320
thinking something or that time we want to see the watch.

9
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.240
In the beginning you may have a little problem, I am not saying you may not have, you may

10
00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:04.400
have, but that's only in the beginning, but gradually you will be all right, gradually

11
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:11.900
you will master it, gradually you will know it so well that you would not like to have

12
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.200
anything else of a cheaper time, you wouldn't care for such a thing.

13
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:26.480
You see, so to get to your beauty, to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality

14
00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:35.360
which is now exposed, only thing you have to do really religiously is to meditate.

15
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.080
That's not that tonight I came very late so I did not meditate, tomorrow you see I have

16
00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.720
to go for work so I cannot meditate.

17
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:51.320
Nobody wants to know the excuses, it's between you and yourself, it is your gain, nobody

18
00:01:51.320 --> 00:02:00.360
else's, it's for your gain everything is happening.

19
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:07.960
Now one has to know that we have achieved a certain height of evolution and from this

20
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:15.320
height you might go up to here, up to here, up to here, I am not saying it's not possible

21
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:22.560
to do that, but first and foremost thing that whatever you may be, may consider you to be

22
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:31.200
a very high class sahaja yogi, you have to be humble about meditation.

23
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.840
This meditative quality, even when I am talking to you, it's just I am getting into it because

24
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.760
it's so joy giving, you just jump into the ocean of joy.

25
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:51.640
First it will be difficult but after sometime you will know that this connection that you

26
00:02:51.640 --> 00:03:03.000
have with Shri Mataji is the only connection that you are looking out for and also there

27
00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:12.880
is another point people get lost with, which I have seen very common with some people who

28
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.560
get lost.

29
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.520
They meditate individually, very much, it is very correct, individually they will meditate

30
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:30.920
and they will sit down, meditate, eat a puja, but collectively they will not meditate.

31
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:37.760
So this is another point one has to remember that you have to be collectively meditate

32
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:44.280
because I am a collective being of all, and when you meditate collectively you are really

33
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.320
very close to Me.

34
00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.920
So even if you have a program or something you must do some meditation with it.

35
00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.720
Always have meditation as the priority for any program.

36
00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:04.360
You sing the songs, it's over, everything is done, then you meditate.

37
00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.760
If I am insisting on something you must know that this must be the truth I am telling,

38
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:21.800
absolutely the basis of it, though it looks rather mundane but it's very important.

39
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:37.160
Now for us to worship Adi Shakti, I don't know what's because there has been no prayers

40
00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.080
or anything about Adi Shakti.

41
00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.800
Up to Bhagavati they have gone, but beyond Bhagavati they have not gone.

42
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:57.160
So I don't know what sort of pujas we will have, but let's try something, maybe.

43
00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.640
I think the meditation is the best way we can really achieve something.

44
00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:08.640
So we can go into meditation for about five minutes.

45
00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:54.360
Can you increase the volume?

46
00:05:54.360 --> 00:06:15.080
Please close your eyes.

47
00:06:45.080 --> 00:07:14.800
Eleven Rudras are awakened and they will destroy all that is negative.

48
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:27.520
May God bless you all.

49
00:07:44.800 --> 00:08:14.040
If we now would like to start the evening, Manish, would you like to tell us what is

50
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.240
the purpose of this?

51
00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:24.360
Thank you all for being here and it's good to meet with everyone virtually.

52
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:33.040
So since we're talking about Kannada Johari, I'll tell you the story of how it all started.

53
00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:41.320
This was in October of 1994, the exact date I don't remember, but it was right after we

54
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.920
did the programs in Chicago.

55
00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:50.560
And then after that we came to New York and she was staying at the Holiday Inn right next

56
00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:53.560
to LaGuardia Airport.

57
00:08:53.560 --> 00:09:01.520
So it was in the morning and as usual, you know, got up, made her tea, offered her tea,

58
00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:07.760
got her the newspaper and just having some light conversation.

59
00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.280
And suddenly she looked at this little ad.

60
00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:18.680
It was really, I mean, very hard to find that ad, but she went straight to that advertisement

61
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.620
for the Kannada Johari land.

62
00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:29.800
And as I was talking to Joe earlier, she talked about the fact that she saw, you know, vibrations

63
00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:31.280
just coming from there.

64
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:35.480
Yes, she did say that she saw vibrations coming from there.

65
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:40.360
And so she told me, she said, call Minoj.

66
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.200
So I called Minoj.

67
00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:47.200
She talked to him, asked him to get hold of the realtor.

68
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:50.560
I don't remember the name of the realtor.

69
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:56.120
And so, you know, then he said, Shrimadi, he's available.

70
00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.280
Would you like to see the property?

71
00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.840
And she said, yes.

72
00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:05.600
So the next day we drove down from New York to Kannada Johari.

73
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:11.640
It took I think it was four hours plus that we took to get to the place and straight.

74
00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.280
We went to the land.

75
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.280
The realtor was there.

76
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.640
By the time we got there, it was kind of getting evening.

77
00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:24.240
I mean, there was still light, but, you know, it was kind of getting to dusk.

78
00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:31.720
And so he heard us talking to each other and, you know, speaking to Shrimadi or Shrimadi

79
00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.480
or mother.

80
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:36.900
So he turned to her and said, Mother, would you like to see the property?

81
00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:39.200
And she said, yes.

82
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:47.280
And so he had an SUV and she got onto an SUV and he drove Shrimadi all around the property.

83
00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.800
And she came back and she said, we're buying it.

84
00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:58.800
And then, of course, you know, whatever payment details had to be figured out, those were

85
00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.080
figured out.

86
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.680
And I know that we drove back to New York that evening.

87
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:13.600
And of course, next day the money was transferred and, you know, the purchase was put into process.

88
00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:20.140
But there is a McDonald's which is right off the road when you get onto the freeway.

89
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:26.060
And so as we were getting to the freeway, Shrimadi said, well, we have to celebrate.

90
00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:31.240
So we all went to McDonald's and we had hamburgers, fries and coke.

91
00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.300
She had a diet coke.

92
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:34.440
We had our cooks.

93
00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.760
So that is the story of how Kana Johari started.

94
00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.200
And then, of course, the rest of it, you're aware of it.

95
00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:47.580
You know, Shrimadi came there several times.

96
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:52.860
Next one I know was that she was we have to get the hangar.

97
00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:55.980
So that was worked on.

98
00:11:55.980 --> 00:12:00.060
But the beginning story is a very short one.

99
00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:08.220
But this one, if you if you go back and you look, I'm telling you, this ad was so teeny.

100
00:12:08.220 --> 00:12:15.100
You know, if you really had to go through the paper, you would have a hard time finding it.

101
00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:22.860
But she went straight to the advertisement and next Kana Johari was put on the chest.

102
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.700
So that's a short story.

103
00:12:25.700 --> 00:12:32.380
And, you know, I'm glad that one was able to share it with you.

104
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.500
Can you please add about the name of Kana Johari for everyone?

105
00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.700
Right. So I remember when we looked, you know, Kana Johari.

106
00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:45.740
So Kana is one of the names of Lord Krishna.

107
00:12:45.740 --> 00:12:54.740
That's Kana. His mother, she showed I used to call him Kana and hurry is, you know, the name of Vishnu.

108
00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:58.660
So Kana Johari is.

109
00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:10.260
Lord Krishna, who is hurry means he's Vishnu himself, and it's amazing that, you know, the place she finds in America has that name.

110
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:16.020
And it is the name given by the indigenous native people.

111
00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:19.700
So, you know, the divine always arranges things in our own way.

112
00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:29.940
Just telling Joe also in the property that she purchased in Los Angeles was in color, color basis.

113
00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:36.540
But if you say the Indian way, Kali Kali Basa, it is the place of the mother Kali.

114
00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:46.380
So, you know, she has her own way of doing things, even in a far fresh place like the U.S., you still find.

115
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:58.380
So, you know, if she used to say that the Indians knew about and these two talk of Adi Shakti as the great grandmother.

116
00:13:58.380 --> 00:14:10.300
And also, I think in Colombia, they talked of the blue colored guard who wrote this big bird, which is again, you know, Shri Krishna, Shri Vishnu on his guru.

117
00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:19.980
So. So that's my part.

118
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.860
That's the little part that I have to share.

119
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.620
And yet was very simple.

120
00:14:26.620 --> 00:14:31.820
Nothing. There was no great planning, no, none of this stuff.

121
00:14:31.820 --> 00:14:33.820
It was very straightforward.

122
00:14:33.820 --> 00:14:44.380
And that's how Kannada Johari came to become Sahaj Lad.

123
00:14:44.380 --> 00:14:48.860
Thank you, Manish. I'm sorry, Jeremy, I did get one more question, Manish, please.

124
00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:55.820
You had mentioned previously that Shrimataji purchased it with her own money.

125
00:14:55.820 --> 00:15:01.020
Yes. And later on, the collective decided to reimburse her.

126
00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:02.780
Can you tell us about that?

127
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:09.740
Yes. So I don't remember the exact amount, but it was somewhere around fifty thousand.

128
00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.780
That was the purchase price for the property.

129
00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:16.460
And like I said, you know, the second day Shrimati went saw the property.

130
00:15:16.460 --> 00:15:20.700
Third day, the money was transferred and the purchase was in process.

131
00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.380
Of course, you know, the paperwork and all that has to be done.

132
00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:32.460
But I think it was about a good year or two, two years, maybe three years that, you know,

133
00:15:32.460 --> 00:15:35.340
everybody said, no, we should pay for this land.

134
00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:36.620
You know, you found it for us.

135
00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:41.260
So then the money was collected and then given to Shrimati.

136
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.780
And yeah, that's the story of Kannada Johari.

137
00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:53.580
Thank you so much.

138
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.620
Any other questions?

139
00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:55.740
Any other questions for me?

140
00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.300
All right. Thank you, everyone.

141
00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:06.860
You've taken time out of hosting a party.

142
00:16:06.860 --> 00:16:09.660
Yes. I'm hosting my holiday party.

143
00:16:10.220 --> 00:16:13.500
So I'm sorry, but I'm going to have to log off.

144
00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:15.660
But thank you so much.

145
00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:16.060
Thank you.

146
00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:21.340
What happened next?

147
00:16:23.180 --> 00:16:24.140
That would be lovely.

148
00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:33.260
Yeah, actually, I was going to talk a little bit about what happened before during the 80s,

149
00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:43.580
because Kannada Johari was a fulfillment of discussions and hints that we had

150
00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.020
gotten on previous visits of Shrimati to New York.

151
00:16:49.420 --> 00:17:00.940
During the 80s, she had said that she, oh, am I, should I wait?

152
00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.020
No, no, sorry, do keep going, keep going.

153
00:17:09.740 --> 00:17:10.460
Yeah, okay.

154
00:17:10.460 --> 00:17:10.940
I didn't.

155
00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:24.620
Yeah, so early, early in during the 80s, there were some mentions that Shrimati would buy

156
00:17:24.620 --> 00:17:30.700
a land in New York and that the vibrations upstate New York very good.

157
00:17:31.660 --> 00:17:35.340
And there wasn't much discussion about it.

158
00:17:35.340 --> 00:17:37.500
And I didn't hear them directly.

159
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:45.180
I was hearing this through our leaders and nothing happened, but it was just that this

160
00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:52.940
would happen that we would this at some point or Shrimati had the interest in getting a

161
00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:54.540
property upstate New York.

162
00:17:54.540 --> 00:18:02.940
I know that during the 80s, we had a seminar upstate New York where people who were interested

163
00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:11.820
in getting a land in New York, where people who got their realization in New York, they

164
00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:15.500
were able to go the same weekend to a seminar with Shrimati.

165
00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:24.300
And so it was around that time where she said that if we had a place upstate of our own,

166
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:30.380
then people would go on retreats and they would be able to get much deeper than they

167
00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:38.380
would be able to just by coming to weekly meetings in a big city.

168
00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:45.980
So this is something that the reason I'm mentioning is because practically all of the things that

169
00:18:46.860 --> 00:18:53.100
Shrimati talked to us about that we could do with the land and what its purpose was

170
00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:58.460
were fulfillments of our desires.

171
00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:06.220
There was someone in the collective or more than probably more than one, we probably shared

172
00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:14.140
the same dreams, that desired the things that and there's a whole list of them and I have

173
00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:22.940
that I could share that with you and show you at some point I will if I may.

174
00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:30.380
But I wanted to step back a bit just to mention that this was

175
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.660
on the horizon, it was in our hearts.

176
00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:45.340
We had gone to seminars that we organized for our small collectives and

177
00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:52.540
the thought came up, the idea was discussed, why don't we have our own place?

178
00:19:53.180 --> 00:20:00.380
This was there and so then it was fulfilled later on.

179
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:07.180
Because you know yogis can talk about things for a long time but Shrimati ji propelled it

180
00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:14.860
in like as Manish said how it happened so quickly and pretty much for a long period of time

181
00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:21.900
after she purchased the land. It was like that, everything happened very quickly

182
00:20:23.900 --> 00:20:31.100
and I'll just add something to what Manish had mentioned was perhaps it was the day after she,

183
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:35.100
I don't remember the exact place in the timeline but perhaps it was the day after

184
00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.140
that Shrimati ji drove up and saw the land.

185
00:20:40.300 --> 00:20:46.220
Some yogis were sent up to look at the land maybe before the final purchase was made,

186
00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:53.580
before the signatures were made, you know just to double check in a sense.

187
00:20:54.220 --> 00:21:00.700
And I was amongst those who went up. There was an engineer primarily who had to come and I was his

188
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:09.180
his navigator, I sat next to him. And this is for me, this is one of the most significant

189
00:21:09.180 --> 00:21:17.900
things was at that time because whoever has driven to Kannada Hari from New York from the south,

190
00:21:17.900 --> 00:21:25.020
drives up and the car is on the road and the car is on the road and the car is on the road.

191
00:21:25.020 --> 00:21:39.820
And then goes west along this Mohawk River and it's a very striking view. It's unforgettable,

192
00:21:39.820 --> 00:21:45.260
especially if you're in the, well whether you're in the passenger or driver's seat, it's a very

193
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:51.980
very, it's an unforgettable view and you're driving along the Mohawk for you know half an hour

194
00:21:51.980 --> 00:21:59.660
or so before you get to the Kannada Hari exit. And I was sitting next to this engineer, Subash

195
00:21:59.660 --> 00:22:06.940
was his name, who Shrimati ji wanted him to or perhaps it was his desire, I don't remember the

196
00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:14.300
discussions because I wasn't in the hotel myself but I somehow got involved in coming up to see the

197
00:22:15.180 --> 00:22:22.300
property. And so anyway I was his navigator and I had the map of New York in my lap

198
00:22:23.100 --> 00:22:27.500
and I was looking down at it and then looking at the route that we were driving and also looking

199
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:33.980
at this view on the right hand side. So anyway we went up, we looked at the property, he talked to

200
00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.820
the realtor about something, I think he was trying to reduce the price or something. There was a lot

201
00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:49.820
of going back and forth and at some point, and he actually called Shrimati ji at one point and

202
00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:57.580
interesting, I think probably no one has heard this before, she said what about the other

203
00:22:57.580 --> 00:23:07.660
property? And there was some other property that the realtor had shown her or mentioned at one

204
00:23:07.660 --> 00:23:14.380
point. And this may have been just a drama, maybe it was just something to put the realtor on,

205
00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:24.860
you know, to make him, I don't know the reason why, but she did ask about another property and

206
00:23:24.860 --> 00:23:30.380
he was very surprised to hear why is she talking about that property. And so there's a bit of

207
00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:36.220
attention I could feel in the conversation. And then finally after looking at everything,

208
00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:43.500
and I think the realtor agreeing to another thousand dollars off that Yogi Aruzweth was very

209
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:48.780
proud of himself that he could make a contribution of reducing the price of it. Although it was

210
00:23:48.780 --> 00:23:57.340
extremely cheap as Manish said, it was extremely cheap, 114 acres for around 50,000. So anyway we

211
00:23:57.340 --> 00:24:02.540
drove back and we had to drive fairly quickly because Shrimati ji was leaving from the airport.

212
00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:11.500
So this is probably the next day after she went up and we wanted to bid her farewell and

213
00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:22.060
Subash probably had something to convey to her. So we drove back down and we saw her off. And this

214
00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:27.020
I have to tell you is that afterwards I went home and I sat down and I was feeling really good,

215
00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:37.180
after seeing Shrimati ji how you feel. You're just completely enveloped in vibrations like

216
00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:45.180
no meditation can ever make you feel. And so I just sat down on the couch and sounds a little,

217
00:24:47.820 --> 00:24:55.500
maybe doesn't sound so good, I switched on the TV. But what happened when I switched on the TV is

218
00:24:55.500 --> 00:25:03.500
the image that was there on the screen was the image, very striking image of a river.

219
00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:17.900
It was an aerial video moving above the river and it just like made me sit up straight in my chair.

220
00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:26.140
I've seen this before. I mean this is immediately after the same day that we came back from driving

221
00:25:26.140 --> 00:25:41.340
there. And the narrator starts talking and talks about Kanuja Hari. And then over the screen

222
00:25:42.300 --> 00:25:51.660
is superimposed fading in a map, a map of New York state. And it's zooming in to

223
00:25:53.820 --> 00:26:02.860
Kanuja Hari and the river. And it's just what I was looking at. And the time we were driving up,

224
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:10.460
the hours we were driving up, it was the same map I had in my hands as I was being the navigator for

225
00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:21.500
this yoki. And so for me it was like, I mean it just, you know, though she had left and I was

226
00:26:21.500 --> 00:26:29.580
back in the Bronx living with my mother. And it's kind of a dingy area where I lived, you know. But

227
00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:41.340
it just brought me so much closer. You know, it made a big point in my life. It just

228
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:53.020
drove the significance home of this. For some reason this incident, this coincidence was

229
00:26:53.820 --> 00:27:01.260
organized, you know, for my benefit to understand the significance, the importance of

230
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:13.900
what had happened today, that day. So I didn't know what it was. And it was the Mohawk Indians

231
00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:19.500
they were talking about. It was a documentary. And so I mean I didn't know, you know, what this,

232
00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:27.740
why this video was there at the time. Exactly, you know, as I probed a little bit into the

233
00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:33.500
the Native Americans and that sort of thing, which Shrimadaji at some point told us not to

234
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:39.980
probe too much into that. Although later when she had the public program in upstate, in Albany,

235
00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:46.540
the Mohawks came, those who had their reservation in Kanujahari.

236
00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:54.300
And by the way, our land isn't, maybe some of you don't know, our land isn't in Kanujahari. It's in

237
00:27:55.660 --> 00:28:02.940
Minden, which is in the village of Fort Plain. But you know, that's the exit you see. And that's how

238
00:28:02.940 --> 00:28:10.540
we've always referred it, referred to it. But anyway, the Mohawks came to her public program

239
00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:18.460
and they recognized her. They gave her some gifts and they said she was, I don't remember the exact

240
00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:27.340
words, but they recognized her as a divine person. We haven't seen them. I don't know if anyone else

241
00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:34.140
has. I don't remember having seen them since. But that was just an interesting,

242
00:28:36.380 --> 00:28:45.660
that was interesting for me. So I'm going to use, I have cheat notes here I'm going to look at,

243
00:28:45.660 --> 00:28:57.820
because it's a long period of time that, you know, we were, a lot of things have happened.

244
00:28:59.420 --> 00:29:05.020
And I haven't actually thought about it in a long time, but I started making notes the other day.

245
00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:14.380
Oh, there was one interesting thing when we went to the McDonald's with Sri Mataji.

246
00:29:15.980 --> 00:29:26.460
And she was waiting. Some people went to get the order. She looked at the yogis that were

247
00:29:27.580 --> 00:29:40.300
standing nearby. And she said, all of our cheeks were pink. And she then explained that they were

248
00:29:40.300 --> 00:29:48.460
pink because of the atmosphere, the air upstate, that it was, there's no pollution.

249
00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:04.380
So after that, we started having seminars on the land. Some yogis, Mark Sutherland,

250
00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:13.020
and some other yogis organized our first seminars. And though we didn't have anything on the land,

251
00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:27.260
we rented tents, hats, and we had caterers make food. And, you know, there was no electricity,

252
00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:34.700
road. It's just lands, just land. But yogis were very interested in being there.

253
00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:43.260
So there were these seminars and inevitably, you know, it would rain and people would get stuck.

254
00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:53.580
But they didn't stop people coming. People wanted to be there. And not only that, but we started

255
00:30:53.580 --> 00:31:00.780
thinking about how could we make these weekends more like the seminars we've had in other places.

256
00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:06.380
And so what do we need is we can cook for ourselves instead of having caterers because

257
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:11.420
the food wasn't plentiful enough or it was expensive. It was good, you know, though there

258
00:31:11.420 --> 00:31:18.460
was nothing there, we're just coming to stay. It was a little expensive. So the yogis who came,

259
00:31:18.460 --> 00:31:24.140
we started thinking, you know, how can we do this better? And we started bringing portable gas

260
00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:33.660
stoves. And we started talking to the neighbors. The neighbor had water and used to, the closest

261
00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:45.500
neighbor had water and would bring a hose for us so that we could have fresh water. And we started

262
00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:52.220
renting the porta potties. And people used to come, but the rain kept coming as well. And

263
00:31:52.220 --> 00:31:57.580
maybe you've heard these stories before. It used to rain so much and the neighbors, people around

264
00:31:57.580 --> 00:32:03.180
used to say, the yogis are coming, that's why it's raining. They actually said that.

265
00:32:05.180 --> 00:32:12.140
Some neighbors, several neighbors said that about us because it happened a lot.

266
00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:21.180
And so we were inevitably, you know, walking around in mud. Our feet were, our boots,

267
00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:29.180
our shoes, everything was in mud. And, you know, a lot of the arrangements were, you know,

268
00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:32.860
we're considering how we're going to manage the mud and that sort of thing. So I'm telling you

269
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:41.420
all this why, because whenever we have a situation where we're going to have a lot of mud,

270
00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:50.780
whenever we had these events, the leader, Manoj, he used to talk to Srimati ji and tell her what,

271
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:56.620
you know, what we've been doing with the land. He actually used to get up, he used to talk to

272
00:32:56.620 --> 00:33:01.260
her almost every day. These are the old days and used to get up like at four in the morning and

273
00:33:01.260 --> 00:33:06.540
talk to her about different things. And the land was, what we were doing with the land was

274
00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:15.900
something that was in her attention. And, you know, he told her things that we were doing,

275
00:33:15.900 --> 00:33:22.220
like the seminars, and we also built a little house or shed. It was actually,

276
00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.980
actually we intended to make a shed so we didn't have to carry things back and forth.

277
00:33:27.740 --> 00:33:34.540
And then we thought we'd make it into two stories because we heard Srimati ji might come,

278
00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:41.580
that she might come and there might be a puja here. And so we should have a place for her to

279
00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.500
stay because there's no place for her to stay in the land. So we put two stories on it. First,

280
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:51.500
we didn't have a big budget. It wasn't very well planned out. It was just very spontaneous,

281
00:33:51.500 --> 00:34:01.740
very innocently thought out that we could host Srimati ji in this little two-story shed, you know.

282
00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:09.980
Of course, it never happened. But, you know, the fact that we did that,

283
00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:17.820
and the fact that yogis from Canada and from mostly around the East Coast, but not only,

284
00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:22.620
there are yogis from the West Coast who came out who were excited about the fact that we had a land

285
00:34:22.620 --> 00:34:33.900
and were there for a lot of the development projects that came after this. But the attention

286
00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:43.820
we put on it, you know, it pleased Srimati ji. That's, I mean, this is the feedback we got from

287
00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:54.300
Manoj. So there was Manoj talking, one person talking to Srimati ji, and he talking to people

288
00:34:54.300 --> 00:35:02.380
on being there who were excited about being there, who had dreams about what this place could be for

289
00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:08.700
us. And everyone had a dream about, you know, what it could be. And I'll get to that in a minute.

290
00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:20.860
So that, I think this was why things grew and why things seemed to happen very quickly,

291
00:35:20.860 --> 00:35:28.700
because her attention was on, she really wanted us to use the land. She was so supportive

292
00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:35.660
of suggestions, and she would make, she'd hear a suggestion from a yogi and then she'd repeat it

293
00:35:35.660 --> 00:35:47.180
to others. So at one point she, some yogi said we should make cabins. So she said to Manoj,

294
00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:56.300
why don't you cut the trees there and make cabins out of them? So, you know, no,

295
00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:05.180
no one had any of that kind of knowledge to do that. So he asked, he asked me to go up and take

296
00:36:05.180 --> 00:36:12.380
a look and see how we could do that and find out how we could do that. So, so, but I'll tell you

297
00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:17.980
that what she said, she was, she gave like very specific directions. She said you cut the tree

298
00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:24.540
and then you pour tar on the base so that it won't grow back.

299
00:36:26.940 --> 00:36:34.220
And take the logs and store them someplace until they dry out and then you can make the

300
00:36:37.660 --> 00:36:43.020
log cabins out of it. So she put, this is only one example, there are many examples where she

301
00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:49.820
gave very specific instructions on how to do things because we didn't, I mean, though we had

302
00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:56.940
desires, we had interests, maybe we didn't have the knowledge or we, you know, we didn't know

303
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:03.340
what to do. So she, she helped us get unstuck and moving in a lot of cases. So anyway, I went up,

304
00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:09.420
it turned out that, I mean, the assessment was from someone I got a hold of there who knew about

305
00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:18.300
trees, that the trees weren't big enough to make log cabins out of it. And so it didn't go any

306
00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:24.300
further. You know, we would have done something, but I don't know what conversation and notion

307
00:37:24.300 --> 00:37:31.340
she had, but we didn't do anything about log cabins. Later on, she drew something. I'll show

308
00:37:31.340 --> 00:37:41.100
you that if I can. How a dwelling would look, how she drew a floor plan for a dwelling

309
00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:45.180
that yogis could live in. So

310
00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:59.420
later on, the hangar was on the horizon and it was something that was discussed. The,

311
00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:09.020
the, the leader, he would talk to Shri Mataji about it. It was something that yogis were talking

312
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:15.980
about prior to that. We knew that they had one in Kibela and there was a yogi in Australia who had

313
00:38:15.980 --> 00:38:23.740
helped them put it up. And we got hold of the video from that, from that yogi in Australia

314
00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:29.980
showed how it can be put up. And at some point we started looking at the availability and he,

315
00:38:29.980 --> 00:38:35.900
he suggested that Yogi says that we look at availability of hangers in in the U S and so

316
00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:43.260
we did that. And there were these plans that I'd send to Minoj and he would send to Shri Mataji.

317
00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:48.540
And, and then we're looking at different sizes and we're looking at quite big hangar, much than

318
00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:57.500
much bigger than the one we ended up getting. But, you know, it's been you know, our,

319
00:38:58.220 --> 00:39:06.140
I don't know what you call it, but it's like our characteristic. We have often not moved quick

320
00:39:06.140 --> 00:39:12.060
enough on suggestions and things like that. I think everyone knows the story. So it was

321
00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:17.820
three weeks before the puja that Shri Mataji was coming for Adishakti puja and was supposed to have

322
00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:24.540
hangar. And so she asked, so how's the construction going? You know, and nothing had been bought.

323
00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:32.140
So so then, I mean, we didn't get any of those that we looked at earlier. We ended up getting

324
00:39:32.140 --> 00:39:37.100
something, something smaller, which we have now. And the idea was to get that and expand it at some

325
00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:47.820
point. And miraculously though, someone found one and was able, you know, it was already

326
00:39:47.820 --> 00:39:51.500
constructed, you know, cause these things take time to put together. So we have to order them in

327
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:56.940
advance and somehow it got up in that short period of time. I mean, miraculously, all, I mean, so many

328
00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:04.060
yogis came together. So many yogis were excited about it. It was a big, big milestone that we

329
00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:09.100
would have this place, a hangar, you know, everybody knew about Kabbalah, the hangar and the gathering

330
00:40:09.820 --> 00:40:16.780
there. And this was, you know, a very significant development that we would have a place like that.

331
00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:26.540
There were rumors going around after we put it up that Shri Mataji would move there. I don't know

332
00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:33.820
where they came from, honestly, but even some Italians believed it. And they were, when they came

333
00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:39.580
to Adi Shaktipuja, some of them stayed afterwards and they were looking at properties nearby where

334
00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:46.940
they could live if she moved here. Cause they just, you know, they were that devoted

335
00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:55.100
that if she's moving, we're moving too. Some of them, yeah. So that rumor was there. And that also propelled

336
00:40:55.100 --> 00:41:00.540
us that we could, you know, those of us who were involved, that, you know, we were going to be a world,

337
00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:10.940
it could be a world center, a place where we would host people on a regular basis, yogis, and

338
00:41:10.940 --> 00:41:18.220
Shri Mataji would be spending a lot more time with us. So that propelled us. So when we built

339
00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:24.060
the hangar, the idea of a road came up because of all the mud and all that. The idea of we should do

340
00:41:24.060 --> 00:41:30.220
a proper road because how are we going to, and Shri Mataji didn't say to put the hangar by the

341
00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:36.700
main road. She said to put it up top, you know, so that's where we put it. And, you know, that's like

342
00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:42.620
more than a quarter of a mile, I think, up the road to the hangar. So we talked about there, but we, when

343
00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:48.060
we put the hangar and we didn't do a road, we just, I think Shri Mataji knew our limits. This was the other

344
00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:59.660
big, you know, thing about my big, what I learned, you know, what I gained from these

345
00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:08.460
interactions was she always proposed things within our limits. You know, they might be maybe a little

346
00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:14.140
bit beyond the limits, so we'd have to stretch a lot, but they were not like extraordinary steps. So like

347
00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:21.020
road was a big thing. We did that during the following year. So when we talked to her about road

348
00:42:21.020 --> 00:42:26.940
and she talked to us, she wanted to talk to the quote unquote builders, the people who were on the

349
00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:32.860
ground and who were interested in getting things going, who took time out. There were people who,

350
00:42:32.860 --> 00:42:38.540
on the West Coast and people on the East Coast, Francois and another Gary from the West Coast, who

351
00:42:39.260 --> 00:42:51.580
stayed on the land prior to the hangar's erection and helped coordinate the, you know, the work that

352
00:42:51.580 --> 00:43:02.460
had to be done. So when we asked her about the road, she didn't say we should do the

353
00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:06.620
gravel and all that because that was a big, big job, but we didn't realize it, you know.

354
00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:13.660
Just getting the hangar up was enough. So she said, she said, what you do is roll, roll the,

355
00:43:14.300 --> 00:43:22.060
get a roller and a big roller and one of those big construction vehicles that, you know, you use for

356
00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:28.140
paving heavy and she said that will pack down the earth, will make it hard, you know, so that you

357
00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:33.900
won't get stuck in the mud. I think we got one. It wasn't big enough, but we got one. She said also,

358
00:43:33.900 --> 00:43:38.060
don't worry. She didn't seem too worried about it. I mean, she knew that wasn't going to happen

359
00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:43.580
that year. We were concerned, but she was not. She said also the trucks coming up and down delivering

360
00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:50.060
they will pack down the road. So she wasn't concerned that year and that year when the

361
00:43:50.060 --> 00:43:57.020
hangar was put up wasn't really, we were pretty good, the weather wasn't, that wasn't the mud year

362
00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:03.820
poocha. We actually built the road in a mud year when it was so muddy.

363
00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:14.700
So yeah, so those are two things, two big things that this interaction

364
00:44:16.380 --> 00:44:19.900
of being associated with this

365
00:44:22.380 --> 00:44:30.060
Kannada Hari development or Nirmal Nagari, she called it Nirmal Nagari is what she called it then.

366
00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:40.460
So she was involved. She was very much supportive. She had all support and gave us so

367
00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:45.900
many suggestions about what we could do with the land. So the sky was the limit. And she even said

368
00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:52.140
at one point we could have a golf, she wanted to have a golf course there. So the thing is

369
00:44:52.140 --> 00:44:59.420
when yogis, you know, when the ideas came up, a lot of yogis deliberate over it, deliberate it.

370
00:44:59.420 --> 00:45:05.260
We did, you know, can we do this? How can we do it? How much will it cost? Who, you know, this and

371
00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:13.900
that kind of thing. She was so, she really pulled us through all that. And

372
00:45:15.580 --> 00:45:22.380
she didn't have like limitations on what we could do with it. And I will show you and I get a chance

373
00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:28.060
if we have enough time or I'll forward it later on. This, I have it open in a tab here somewhere.

374
00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:33.500
Like all these things that we consolidated into a document

375
00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:44.620
to, you know, about what the land use could be. And they include all things that, you know, even,

376
00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:52.460
you know, she even told what kinds of fruit you could grow. And she even said we could grow cattle,

377
00:45:52.460 --> 00:46:01.180
we could raise cattle and that sort of thing. So everything was there. I mean, what else?

378
00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:09.980
When we, before we put up the hangar, Shri Mataji had a meeting with all the yogis,

379
00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:17.740
handful of yogis. There were like maybe eight, six, eight of us. I don't know. And it was in

380
00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:27.180
New York where she was staying. And she showed where to put the road, where the parking lot will

381
00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:34.060
be. She showed where the hangar would be. She showed which side of the hangar the

382
00:46:35.580 --> 00:46:39.340
stage would go, how it should be oriented left and right.

383
00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:45.580
And, you know, things came up while we were there. And we're looking at the map of the land.

384
00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:51.740
And, you know, she's asking about what's on this air. And it's just fields of grass. And

385
00:46:52.380 --> 00:46:58.140
then someone said, the neighbors, they're cutting your grass, you know, something like that.

386
00:46:58.940 --> 00:47:04.380
And she responded, oh, that's all right. They'll help you. The neighbors will help you. And that

387
00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:11.980
was a mantra because there were so many troubles we got into, including getting stuck in the mud.

388
00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:21.340
So many problems that we had that didn't last long, the problems. But like hurdles we had in

389
00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:27.980
getting things done that talking to the neighbors got it resolved. It's, oh, yes, you just do this.

390
00:47:27.980 --> 00:47:32.940
Okay, right. And so we had to get it done. And we had to get it done. And so we had to get it

391
00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:37.820
done. And so, yes, you just do this. Okay, we're putting in the road and we had to put a culvert

392
00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:42.620
in. No one has ever put a culvert in. And the guy's just driving by. So what you doing? Oh,

393
00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:46.700
putting a cover. Okay, let me get on. He jumps on the tractor. And he says, you know, you dig out a

394
00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.740
little bit here, and you level it like this. And that was it. And then he drove away. So this kind

395
00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:59.580
of thing happened over and over again, whenever we had things that needed to be done, and we didn't

396
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:04.460
seem to have them. They seemed insurmountable. The neighbors, especially there were a couple of

397
00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:07.900
neighbors there. But there was the one set of neighbors that were McGovern's. They were

398
00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:14.220
very, very helpful. They were not real secret, but they were very good people. I mean, we tried

399
00:48:15.020 --> 00:48:19.820
invited them once to the Shrimataji's house, which became an ashram later on,

400
00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:25.340
and to give realization. But they were not interested. But they were very respectful to

401
00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:29.340
Shrimataji. And we used to invite them to the entertainment program, and they used to enjoy it.

402
00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:35.980
And, you know, they weren't seekers, but they were like good ganas, you know. They

403
00:48:38.300 --> 00:48:44.860
were good for us, and they were obeying, you know, the neighbors will help you, that she said that

404
00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:55.020
day. There was a property next to ours. I don't know if everybody knows, but there was this land

405
00:48:55.020 --> 00:49:05.180
that Shrimataji got is one of three parcels that was owned by, you can find out later,

406
00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:15.740
it's in the video, I think, it was owned by a drug dealer. They were distilling something in

407
00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:23.500
the property next to ours, which is all part, which is actually was all part of one property.

408
00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:26.460
So after that bust, and it was like the biggest bust in,

409
00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:36.940
isn't it amazing? Yeah, so there's nothing like the vibrations are bad, so let's avoid that place.

410
00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:42.140
No, no, nothing. I mean, the vibrations are pure, so these people were hanging out for a while

411
00:49:42.140 --> 00:49:50.460
there. That's all, you know. So, but any case, it was a bust, one of the biggest busts in history.

412
00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:54.540
And then the government took over the land, and then a realtor bought it and divided it into three

413
00:49:54.540 --> 00:50:02.860
pieces. So there was a property adjacent to us, which was part of ours, and originally one neighbor

414
00:50:02.860 --> 00:50:07.580
lived there, he used to help us, they told you they gave us to bring, let us use their water before we

415
00:50:07.580 --> 00:50:16.860
had our own well. And that property had a nice pond that you could see, and we can see from our land,

416
00:50:16.860 --> 00:50:21.340
a nice big pond. Our pond is nice and big too, but it was another nice pond and very close by. And

417
00:50:22.380 --> 00:50:30.380
I think we were talking about ponds to Sri Mataji, and she said, came up that the neighbor has a nice

418
00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:34.060
pond, and she said, why don't you go over there and see if he'll let us, you know, use the pond.

419
00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:39.580
So later on that house got bought by another person, and he wasn't, he wasn't very nice,

420
00:50:39.580 --> 00:50:47.580
and he wouldn't let us use the pond, and he wouldn't, yeah, he wasn't very friendly.

421
00:50:48.140 --> 00:50:54.940
But she, you know, she was at some point also, she asked us to see if we can try to get that

422
00:50:54.940 --> 00:51:02.860
house, and we tried to get it, but the price was never like what we thought was worth paying

423
00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:09.660
for, so we'd never bought that property. We did buy another property which was part of the,

424
00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:16.460
you know, original land. There was another 88 acres, and we don't, maybe nobody even,

425
00:51:16.460 --> 00:51:24.300
very few people know about it, because it's not adjacent. It's, let me see, one second, I think

426
00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:32.220
I can share my screen, right? Can I? And then I can show you, no it's disabled, never mind, okay.

427
00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:43.660
But the three properties, there's ours, and then there's this neighbor's, and then there's one

428
00:51:43.660 --> 00:51:50.540
other 88 acres, so the neighbor's is in between. So we bought that as well, BND owns that.

429
00:51:52.380 --> 00:52:01.740
I think we never, like no one really can, I don't know of any plans, yeah, how we use it or anything

430
00:52:01.740 --> 00:52:09.420
like that. So let me see.

431
00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:20.220
Sorry, I don't think we can do the screen share. That's okay, it's okay.

432
00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:24.460
Apologies for that. No problem at all, yeah, I won't try again.

433
00:52:24.460 --> 00:52:29.100
Yeah, we'll see if we can forward the information afterwards. Yeah, that might be worth doing it.

434
00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:34.060
Yeah, is it chat work? Can I like drop the link in the chat for people?

435
00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:36.540
Thanks, Ritu, I think the chat works, does it not?

436
00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:41.020
Yeah, I'll just drop. Yeah, the chat works.

437
00:52:41.820 --> 00:52:43.900
Oh, okay, let me drop that in. This is,

438
00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:52.140
If you share that, then I can probably, I can share to either, I can either send it to

439
00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:58.860
Katie or you. Yeah, if you could send it to me. Okay. And then I can share that.

440
00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:05.660
Okay. So that's, I mean, you can find that yourself also, but that's,

441
00:53:07.100 --> 00:53:13.180
that's the map. And while I'm here, I'll just see what else I can share.

442
00:53:14.540 --> 00:53:19.100
All right, when I get to it, there's something else I want to share as well.

443
00:53:22.700 --> 00:53:36.700
Yeah, I can share that. Yeah. Okay.

444
00:53:43.020 --> 00:53:46.700
I'm gonna give you another link as well.

445
00:53:47.100 --> 00:53:50.460
Okay, we'll just stick on this for now. Yeah.

446
00:53:54.300 --> 00:54:01.500
Yeah, so yeah, you can zoom in. And I think you see Starkville Road there

447
00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:08.460
towards the right hand, top right hand corner, you see Starkville Road. And then you can see

448
00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:15.260
our hangar. You see the hangar and it says Canada Harry School there. And then you can see

449
00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:21.740
the hangar. And right next to it on the right side, you see Chris Road. That's where this

450
00:54:21.740 --> 00:54:28.620
other property is. It's at the end of that road. And then on the right side of Chris Road,

451
00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:38.620
right side of Chris Road is the, so yeah, it will be on the lower part of the screen on the right.

452
00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:42.540
Yeah, you can see like some rectangles.

453
00:54:49.660 --> 00:55:03.260
Yeah, so you can see that it's 76. Yeah. Or you see that road that's running right diagonally from

454
00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:08.380
the bottom right hand corner to the top. That's Starkville Road. And then below that,

455
00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:15.980
on the right hand side, the dark green area with the rectangles, that's the other property. That's

456
00:55:15.980 --> 00:55:21.900
the 88 acres. There are two fields there or there were two fields. If you don't cut them regularly,

457
00:55:21.900 --> 00:55:26.060
and I don't know if they're getting cut, whether they're still fields, you know, brush starts to

458
00:55:26.060 --> 00:55:36.540
grow up. Yeah, so that's the whole property that the realtor had and sold to different people. And

459
00:55:36.540 --> 00:55:39.420
then we've got two of three of them.

460
00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:46.780
We've got two of three of them.

461
00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:54.140
Thanks.

462
00:56:03.020 --> 00:56:09.820
So I want to give you another link. Now, this is a document that some yogis

463
00:56:10.540 --> 00:56:16.380
put together. At one point, Shri Mataji asked yogis...

464
00:56:20.940 --> 00:56:26.940
She asked that she talked to the leader and asked for formation of a committee

465
00:56:28.060 --> 00:56:38.860
to kind of organize the work in Kannada Hari. And there was a cab driver and

466
00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:55.980
a construction person and a gardener. And the three of us put together this document

467
00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:06.540
of which would be the uses for the land. And these were, you know, these were all

468
00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:20.220
these things were discussed with Shri Mataji. I think Shri Mataji really encouraged us to dream.

469
00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:21.420
And

470
00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:31.020
Isn't it even with you share this document?

471
00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:37.900
Yeah, it's fine. You know, this is history. You can share it, you can do what you like.

472
00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:44.380
I mean, this is old. Yeah, this is like from the year 2000, something like that.

473
00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:52.060
Anyway, if you go further down, I think it shows like what things we can grow.

474
00:57:55.660 --> 00:58:02.860
So a lot of these things we've done, a lot of these things were basic things.

475
00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:07.900
It was kind of a big thing for us at the time. Maybe there's another document that I have.

476
00:58:09.580 --> 00:58:13.900
If I have more time to look on another time, I'll forward it to you.

477
00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:25.260
So did most of this get done?

478
00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.660
So did most of this get done?

479
00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:34.380
I would say a lot of this got done, you know, a lot of this got done.

480
00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:41.420
Some things didn't get done, you know. And I don't want to focus on that, you know.

481
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:45.980
But it's a very long list.

482
00:58:45.980 --> 00:58:50.700
Yeah, I don't want to I think a lot of this got done. I think the important things must

483
00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:55.260
have gotten done. Shrimataji, while she was talking with us,

484
00:58:57.820 --> 00:59:00.300
I think she made sure that the important things got done.

485
00:59:01.980 --> 00:59:05.820
And you say to us about how many yogis were working on this?

486
00:59:07.100 --> 00:59:12.220
Well, there were a lot of yogis who expressed interest in working on this.

487
00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:19.340
There were just three of us who like were in this committee to begin with. And it's actually,

488
00:59:19.340 --> 00:59:23.740
it seemed to work better that way when there were just, you know, there weren't many.

489
00:59:25.340 --> 00:59:32.780
And, you know, you could, and if there was a good rapport, and it worked fairly well.

490
00:59:32.780 --> 00:59:39.740
So that through this, you know, the work that we got done where, you know, the locations of

491
00:59:39.740 --> 00:59:47.100
the buildings, the first kitchens, the parking lot,

492
00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:53.740
the hangar actually was done before we had this committee.

493
01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:07.020
Can we bring Joe in a moment? Because I know Joe was really involved with a lot of this as well.

494
01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:17.260
Hi, everyone. Some of you know me very well. I started off in London.

495
01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:25.180
And mother sent me back to America to do the work here. So I've been here since 1993.

496
01:00:26.780 --> 01:00:30.140
And at some point in time, of course, when the land was purchased,

497
01:00:31.340 --> 01:00:38.700
as 94. So very soon after that I was living further away in Philadelphia and point south.

498
01:00:39.260 --> 01:00:44.220
But somehow managed to get the enthusiasm to travel up frequently to Kennejahari,

499
01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:48.860
which was quite the amazing place. And as Michael can attest, it was,

500
01:00:49.660 --> 01:00:56.140
we always felt rejuvenated and amazing after we got back and camping was very basic.

501
01:00:57.340 --> 01:01:03.500
We didn't have a lot of facilities. By the time I joined some of the poojas, there was maybe 25

502
01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:12.300
to 40 people maximum. And we cooked for ourselves and we swam in the ponds. And

503
01:01:12.300 --> 01:01:20.380
because there's two ponds, although we only use the one now. And we cooked for ourselves and

504
01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:26.380
cleaned up after ourselves and then miracle of miracles, they built the hangar. And shortly after

505
01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.620
the hangar, there was the first little kitchen which Michael starts to tell you about. But

506
01:01:30.620 --> 01:01:38.540
apparently it was not constructed in the right spot. So a second one was then developed and

507
01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:45.980
built. At the same time, they also built the bathhouse and adjacent. And in between,

508
01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:51.340
there was meant to be a children's playground because at some point in time, I was drawn into

509
01:01:51.340 --> 01:02:01.180
all of this enthusiasm, even though remotely through Michael. And they would talk to Sharmataji

510
01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:06.700
and then he would tell me things and then I would go back to my drawing table and draw things up,

511
01:02:06.700 --> 01:02:13.500
which I am going to give to Adrian to scan and make available for everyone. We have a plethora

512
01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:19.820
of ideas. So but those first ones were quite amazing. And there was a lot of rain and we

513
01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:25.900
did have wellingtons everybody wore boots. And we lost shoes in the mud as well. I mean,

514
01:02:25.900 --> 01:02:32.940
it was quite hilarious. I remember being in one small pen doll, maybe the size of I don't know.

515
01:02:33.820 --> 01:02:38.700
I don't know Michael, how long was it? Maybe it wasn't even 40 feet long. It's maybe 35 feet long,

516
01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:46.860
maybe 20 some feet wide rained all weekend. We cooked and we had havan and we had puja

517
01:02:46.860 --> 01:02:52.540
all under this and we slept all under the same pen doll because it was raining. We couldn't go

518
01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:59.980
out and do anything outside. But we all had a great time. And we all had we were so thankful

519
01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:03.340
that we had them McGovern's as our neighbors because they would pull us out of the mud

520
01:03:03.340 --> 01:03:11.180
regularly with the tractor. And it was quite the beginning for untold amount of adventures

521
01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:18.140
yet to happen in Kenan Johari. But when I came on the scene, it was I had moved to Rochester,

522
01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:25.820
New York from Philadelphia. And we were living about two hours away. And Michael said,

523
01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:31.100
Shama Chaji has expressed interest in buying a house because they had put her

524
01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:39.020
in rental units for the 1999 Adi Shakti puja and the 2000 Shakti puja 2000 Adi Shakti puja.

525
01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:44.700
They had rented houses for her and looked after her that way. And she expressed interest. And

526
01:03:44.700 --> 01:03:51.500
Michael described to me that we should find a house for her in the area. So as Michael can

527
01:03:51.500 --> 01:03:58.380
tell you, we went to all the different well, two or three different realtors. And we looked at as

528
01:03:58.380 --> 01:04:05.500
many properties as you can imagine, and scouted them out for Shama Chaji sending quick hand

529
01:04:05.500 --> 01:04:13.740
drawings to Manoj to show to Shama Chaji and Kabela. And she kept saying no, no, no, not this

530
01:04:13.740 --> 01:04:19.980
one, not this one and all the different areas around the land. Michael, how far away did we go?

531
01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:26.860
Not more than five miles, right? Not more than might have been more than five miles. I mean,

532
01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:33.740
we looked. But I mean, yeah, I mean, we, we didn't, I don't know if we really measured the miles.

533
01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:39.260
We were just, you know, we didn't know the area very well, but we thought this was in the,

534
01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:46.780
in a good direction from Kena Johari and around five, five miles, maybe more or less. Yeah.

535
01:04:48.220 --> 01:04:53.100
And inevitably Shama Chaji always said no. And then Michael, what did she say? She said to you,

536
01:04:53.900 --> 01:05:00.940
or she said to Manoj. Do you remember? Well, yeah, it, it just so happened. I don't

537
01:05:00.940 --> 01:05:11.340
remember who came across it, but when someone came across an advertisement for a, for a double wide,

538
01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:22.220
a manufactured home, it was like an unbelievable, it was a poster, you know, like an eight by 12

539
01:05:22.220 --> 01:05:30.220
sheet of paper that was displayed someplace. And it had a list of all the amenities that the

540
01:05:30.220 --> 01:05:34.940
house included. And it's a house that, you know, you could put down,

541
01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:43.420
I don't know what it was like 40,000, 50,000 dollars. And you could,

542
01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:48.540
you know, have it delivered and it looked just like a house.

543
01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:57.980
Shama Chaji said, she said, what? She said, why? Why look for houses?

544
01:05:58.700 --> 01:06:01.340
She said, she said, I'll take two of them.

545
01:06:06.460 --> 01:06:12.460
The house to be built on the land. Yes. And that was, that turned out to be a bit of a Maya,

546
01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:19.900
that two house thing, because we were going to put a house and we had to get a permit. So

547
01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:27.340
talk to the townspeople about that. And they said, okay, you're like a religious organization. You

548
01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:33.100
guys can, you know, normally it's one house, one piece of land, but you're a religious organization.

549
01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:38.460
You can have a house, you can have two houses, you can have a congregation building, you can have all

550
01:06:38.460 --> 01:06:44.300
kinds of things. All we want is you to tell us everything you're going to, you're planning to do,

551
01:06:44.300 --> 01:06:48.380
write it up in a, like a master plan. You can change it later on if you want.

552
01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:53.420
You give that to us. And then after that, you can apply for permits as you need them.

553
01:06:53.420 --> 01:06:55.180
So that's what they did.

554
01:06:55.180 --> 01:06:57.020
Oh, I got too busy. Yes.

555
01:06:57.020 --> 01:06:58.940
Yes. That's right.

556
01:06:58.940 --> 01:07:04.380
I got busy on the drafting table and I drove, I drew up three or four different proposals for

557
01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:09.820
houses in different locations, but it was really interesting how we found the location for

558
01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:15.340
Shamad Digi's house. We were walking around the land because the hangar was already there

559
01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.740
and it needed to be fairly close to the road because of the access problem with the mud.

560
01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:27.180
So we were cognizant of being careful to check the front part of the property closest to Starkville

561
01:07:27.180 --> 01:07:32.380
road for locations to put the house. And we walked around like this, right, Michael?

562
01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:38.300
We walked around the property in the front checking vibrations where this house should be.

563
01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:48.140
That's right. Someone, a team of yogi said that this was the coolest spot and it was a place where

564
01:07:48.220 --> 01:07:57.020
yogi had planted pine trees. His idea was that we'd have like Christmas trees to sell in the

565
01:07:57.020 --> 01:08:04.140
future, to do some agriculture there. But it was really was the best spot for a house. It was also

566
01:08:04.140 --> 01:08:12.300
somewhat hidden so that it's not right in the middle of the traffic and all the yogis going

567
01:08:12.300 --> 01:08:17.420
back and forth from the hangar. So, I mean, when you and I and others looked at it, it was very

568
01:08:17.420 --> 01:08:24.220
clear this was going to be the spot and that's where it ended up being. And then we had to worry

569
01:08:24.220 --> 01:08:29.180
about the infrastructure. We had to have a driveway and a slab and a place for the well

570
01:08:29.180 --> 01:08:33.900
and a place for the septic and electrical access and all those things. So all those things had to

571
01:08:33.900 --> 01:08:39.980
be permitted and done and all within two months. Yeah. In a very short period of time, very short

572
01:08:39.980 --> 01:08:44.620
period of time. And then she, she herself, she, she picked everything because isn't that correct?

573
01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:56.140
She chose all the finishes and, and, you know, I know that, I know that Manoj told us and I,

574
01:08:56.780 --> 01:09:01.100
I didn't have that conversation that she picked it, you know, and she might have, you know.

575
01:09:03.420 --> 01:09:08.780
Some things he decided. He was just being very practical. But she was very pleased with

576
01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:15.660
everything. Though it was a manufactured home that many people were skeptical about,

577
01:09:17.660 --> 01:09:21.100
you know, in terms of what it quality, what kind of quality it would be,

578
01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:28.140
she was very pleased with it. She, she really liked the home and especially it was built very

579
01:09:28.140 --> 01:09:35.100
quickly. During the same time, her, the house she was building for Cersei P in New Jersey,

580
01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:44.940
that was also going on. And there were times when there were two occasions when she was coming to

581
01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:55.260
visit and she stayed in Canada, Harry, because the because, you know, it's different building a house

582
01:09:55.260 --> 01:10:02.060
from scratch. The house in New Jersey wasn't built yet. So, but she stayed in CJ's. We were able to

583
01:10:02.060 --> 01:10:10.700
host her there. I wanted to mention a little Maya that is related to this house and the two houses

584
01:10:10.700 --> 01:10:17.980
that she requested. I don't know if I mentioned it to you before, but, you know, she asked for

585
01:10:17.980 --> 01:10:25.660
two houses and then this town's person said we can do what we want to do, you know, but I think

586
01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:33.980
I do know where it came from. It didn't come from Srimadaji. I'm sure it was from some yogis,

587
01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:39.500
I suppose, said that we, you know, let's just do one house now and we'll do the other house later.

588
01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:47.180
And so that's what we did. And so later on, after we built the house, she did want the other house.

589
01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:54.220
She talked about it again. She met with the salesman who, who get, who sold us that house.

590
01:10:54.220 --> 01:11:00.460
And he said he could make it any way we wanted. And, you know, he could have it to us quickly.

591
01:11:00.460 --> 01:11:05.900
And so she asked us to tell the town we were going to do another house. And so that's what we did.

592
01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:09.180
We did this special permit. We told him there was going to be another house. We told him,

593
01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:12.700
maybe you did some of the drawing where the second house would be. Yes, you did.

594
01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:17.180
There are two. It's a proposal B and proposal C. Yeah.

595
01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:21.740
Yeah. So we had picked out a location for the second house. I think one house was going to be

596
01:11:22.620 --> 01:11:30.700
for the yogis and one was going to be for her and her family. That was the idea in the beginning.

597
01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:38.220
And so that didn't happen right away, the second house for some reason or another.

598
01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:48.940
And later on some yogis came to, Shri Mataji was very interested in, in building,

599
01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:55.500
you know, the second house, but she always talked about residences. And, you know, there was the,

600
01:11:58.460 --> 01:12:02.860
the cabins that she talked about first of all. And then these, she thought it was a good idea

601
01:12:02.860 --> 01:12:09.420
to have these manufactured homes. And then with different yogis, she had this, this conversations

602
01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:15.740
about straw bale homes. I mean, not the same yogi, but like there were different yogis that

603
01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:22.700
she had conversations with some in Europe, some in America about. And then at that time,

604
01:12:22.700 --> 01:12:28.540
I think at that time in America, or maybe in the world, straw bale homes were a thing, you know,

605
01:12:28.540 --> 01:12:37.100
it was something that was, people were doing a lot of it was. And so anyway, she said, we should

606
01:12:37.100 --> 01:12:41.340
do that. And there were some yogis in Europe that were interested in that. And they came to the U S

607
01:12:42.220 --> 01:12:49.420
and their, their job was to help us get to the straw bale and make the straw bale home.

608
01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:57.260
And then eventually they designed something that was going, I'm going to share the concept

609
01:12:57.260 --> 01:13:06.620
drawing of it. It was designed to be like a school. And we've been, we've, I have plans for it,

610
01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:16.220
engineered plans for it. And yeah, we had learned everything that needed to be done

611
01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:24.540
about making this and we were ready and we even applied for the building permit to put it in place.

612
01:13:24.700 --> 01:13:33.820
But you know, you know, as things, as time progressed, Srimadaji talked less to

613
01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:44.140
the leader and then the leadership changed into a council. So it was less access. There wasn't this

614
01:13:44.140 --> 01:13:49.340
daily talk back and forth. We were more on our own, you know, like we were growing up, maybe,

615
01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:56.060
you know, we were not the babies anymore. We were maybe, that's the way I think about it. Like the

616
01:13:56.060 --> 01:14:01.500
early period was the baby chick period or magic period where there was a lot of back and forth

617
01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:08.780
between Srimadaji and what we were going to do and corrections and directions about how, how to do

618
01:14:08.780 --> 01:14:13.420
things. And then later on there were, there was more, you know, she talked less, I mean, to

619
01:14:13.420 --> 01:14:19.260
everyone. It was that period of time where she talked less about how to do things. And then

620
01:14:19.980 --> 01:14:24.780
there was a period of time where she was speaking less and that's when the councils were formed.

621
01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:32.140
And somehow, you know, the original plan didn't get communicated, that we were going to have two

622
01:14:32.140 --> 01:14:38.220
houses and there were going to be two manufactured houses that didn't get communicated. So we had a

623
01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:42.620
permit. They called this, they have to have two permits. One is a special permit. One special

624
01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:48.860
permit said that you're going to have manufactured homes and then you're applying for a building

625
01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.940
that wasn't a manufactured home. And that continuity was lost. So there's just more

626
01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:58.700
people were involved and different people were talking to the town at that point. And so they

627
01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:07.900
didn't approve of the permit. You know, we would have had to revise our original permit. But I want

628
01:15:07.900 --> 01:15:14.060
to show you, it's a pretty building. I'm not going to share the plans, but I'm going to share

629
01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:27.020
the concept drawing. It's a big building. It's a two-story and it's as much

630
01:15:29.900 --> 01:15:38.140
square footage of the hangar. And I shared that to read too, just now.

631
01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:47.740
If we could look at that, if it's appropriate, we can look at that.

632
01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:56.220
After that, we're going to run out of time. I just want to share one last story with you.

633
01:16:02.220 --> 01:16:03.020
See if it comes up.

634
01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:07.340
Do you want to go, Joan, if it comes up, we'll work around that.

635
01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.060
Okay, that's fine.

636
01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:10.380
If the right time is ticking.

637
01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:17.660
We had the two pujas with Srimataji, 1999 Adishakti. And then the following year,

638
01:16:17.660 --> 01:16:27.740
the rains of 2000 Adishakti puja. And that was the year Srimataji had asked us to also host

639
01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:35.980
weddings. And that was really a huge undertaking on many levels. Not just in preparing the land

640
01:16:35.980 --> 01:16:42.220
for Srimataji and her house and everything. Also modifications had to be made to the house. It had

641
01:16:42.220 --> 01:16:49.820
to be made enlarged because we needed an extra new room for source DP. And a few other changes were

642
01:16:49.980 --> 01:16:55.660
made in the house. Those were all done in the ensuing year. So that when she would come back

643
01:16:55.660 --> 01:17:02.460
in 2000, they were more comfortable. But we had gigantic pendants for everybody to sleep in,

644
01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:08.060
the ladies and the men. We didn't have any pole barn yet. And we still had the same

645
01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:16.060
bath house and the same, the second kitchen. And we had to manage to cook, not just for the yogis,

646
01:17:16.220 --> 01:17:21.980
but also for the weddings. And we had to somehow get all the brides ready and all the grooms ready

647
01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:28.220
and down to the hanger without getting covered with mud. So there was this battalion of people

648
01:17:28.220 --> 01:17:37.980
with wellies and umbrellas to escort each and every bride or groom down to the hanger in a

649
01:17:37.980 --> 01:17:45.900
procession of sorts so that they couldn't A, see each other and B, that they would stay dry

650
01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:51.500
and clean until they could get down to the marriage ceremony. So it was a huge undertaking.

651
01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:58.380
It was a lot of fun. It was a crazy time because it rained pretty much nonstop and the mud was very

652
01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:04.700
deep. And holding up these ladies' saris so we could get them down the hill was actually

653
01:18:04.700 --> 01:18:08.860
quite an undertaking, holding umbrellas over them because they were all beautiful, you know,

654
01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:13.980
with the decoration and the makeup and the jewelry and the beautiful heavy saris. So

655
01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:20.540
it was a quite an undertaking. And there are photographs from the weddings that have been

656
01:18:20.540 --> 01:18:27.980
posted by Adrienne on Eternal Moments, which are available for everyone. And you can enjoy the fact

657
01:18:27.980 --> 01:18:35.420
and you can enjoy the fact that how this got done, we don't know how we fed 1000 people,

658
01:18:35.420 --> 01:18:46.060
we don't know how we made the beautiful repast for the marriages. It just all got done. And I was on

659
01:18:46.060 --> 01:18:51.020
the kitchen team that year. So I was part of not just helping the brides, but actually actually

660
01:18:51.020 --> 01:18:58.540
cooking for the whole crowd. So it was a beautiful time. Quite amazing. The vibrations were incredible.

661
01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:06.620
And to see all of this unfold out of this very humble place, this beautiful land,

662
01:19:07.340 --> 01:19:13.340
to come together to have such an event was just spectacular. Spectacular. There's no other words.

663
01:19:14.060 --> 01:19:22.220
And everybody, you know, from the smallest child to the elder, the eldest adult, had the best time

664
01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:28.140
of their lives just to be there on the land just to be with Sharmataji, just to witness how

665
01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:33.820
how far we had come already, from the very humble beginning of this teeny tiny little

666
01:19:33.820 --> 01:19:39.980
advertisement in the New York Times. So I think that wraps it up for me. Michael, do you have that

667
01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:47.660
document? Yeah, I forwarded that. I sent that to you too. Yeah, that is just,

668
01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:53.740
yeah, would you like to say that? Yeah, that's the drawing Sharmataji made. Yeah,

669
01:19:53.740 --> 01:19:59.900
yeah, this one for a dwelling. I can share that. That's fine. And if any of you want to come to

670
01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:05.260
Kanet Johari, please do. I know some of you have already been there. But whoever of you have

671
01:20:05.260 --> 01:20:10.300
haven't yet had the opportunity, it is an experience you will never forget. It's completely

672
01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:22.140
vibrated and wonderful. And a lot of a lot of joy there. Please come. Okay, that I'm sorry, that's

673
01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:29.580
the that's the straw bale that was not built, but was designed. That was the concept drawing.

674
01:20:29.580 --> 01:20:39.020
So the walls are like of a kind of concrete, not quite concrete, it's using clay and lime.

675
01:20:40.620 --> 01:20:46.700
And then inside the walls are the straw, something Sharmataji showed a lot of interest in and asked

676
01:20:46.700 --> 01:20:55.500
some people come to come to us to do. And I think it's been forgotten. And like I said, I have the

677
01:20:55.500 --> 01:21:08.460
the stamped engineer drawing for that. I think we may have to wrap it up there. Thank you so so

678
01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:16.380
much, Michael and Joe. Just makes me want to go to Kaljahari now. Please. Wait, wait till the

679
01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:21.420
weather's nice. And then you can go swimming in the barn. There does seem to be a lot of mud in

680
01:21:21.420 --> 01:21:27.420
the history of this. But we're out of the mud. We're out of the mud. Now we have that. Yeah,

681
01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:34.060
we didn't get we didn't get to talk. We actually built the road and pathways and there's a hanger

682
01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:41.340
and there's a Yeah, I mean, you need it. You'll need a good tent. You know, there's the pole barn.

683
01:21:42.140 --> 01:21:47.100
Yeah, yeah. I mean, if it's very full, there are a lot of people there, you probably want to have

684
01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:54.780
your own tent and a good one that doesn't leak. Yeah. Oh, my God. It's just extraordinary,

685
01:21:54.780 --> 01:22:04.140
extraordinary what has been created over there. A real paradise, real paradise. And what vision.

686
01:22:04.140 --> 01:22:10.460
I love the creativity that has gone into it all from the beginning. Wonderful tales, wonderful

687
01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:16.300
stories. I'm sure there's lots more. There's lots more. Yes. We have a lot of stories.

688
01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:25.100
There's lots more time this evening. Yeah, I know. But thank you for having us. We are honored that

689
01:22:25.100 --> 01:22:31.660
we get to share some of this very fun stories. That's great. That's great. Maybe more for next

690
01:22:31.660 --> 01:22:36.780
time, which I'll see what happens in January. But thank you very, very much both for sharing

691
01:22:37.340 --> 01:22:40.220
and taking time out of your day because it's your day over there now.

692
01:22:40.540 --> 01:22:44.620
We've had a wonderful evening. Thank you, everyone.

693
01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:49.740
We shall leave it there for this evening. But thank you very, very much.

694
01:22:56.460 --> 01:23:00.860
Thank you, everyone, for joining us this evening as well. Thanks for inviting us.

695
01:23:03.580 --> 01:23:08.700
It's a real pleasure. It's a real pleasure. Thank you very much.

696
01:23:10.620 --> 01:23:10.780
Thank you.

697
01:23:13.660 --> 01:23:20.300
Saving these links and see if I can. Thank you. If you can. Michael, just a request if you can

698
01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:26.540
probably share it in early Yogi's group. Okay, I don't. I might have that. I think

699
01:23:26.540 --> 01:23:33.980
you sent that to me, Joe, the early Yogi's link. If you didn't, I'll check. I can try to save. But

700
01:23:33.980 --> 01:23:39.580
just to be sure. Sure, sure, sure. We'll get it to you somehow. Yeah. Thank you so much. Thank you.

701
01:23:39.980 --> 01:23:44.540
No problem. Bye bye. Bye, everyone. Thank you so much.

702
01:23:46.540 --> 01:23:53.420
And love from this side of the world. The Atlantic over to yours. Thank you.
