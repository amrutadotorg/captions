1
00:34:19,327 --> 00:34:25,975
I wanted to be with you people
on a Christmas day,

2
00:34:26,344 --> 00:34:29,888
but it never happened before.

3
00:34:30,088 --> 00:34:36,049
It has so chanced that I have to be here
with you today and on the New Year.

4
00:34:36,250 --> 00:34:39,221
Something good has to happen
I hope next year,

5
00:34:39,422 --> 00:34:43,125
some good luck has to come.

6
00:34:47,352 --> 00:34:55,236
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

7
00:34:55,437 --> 00:35:02,572
was planned in such a manner that
He was to be born

8
00:35:02,773 --> 00:35:09,299
in a place which was very humble,
very humble place.

9
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:15,346
Because He came to teach us humility.

10
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:23,421
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

11
00:35:25,108 --> 00:35:35,205
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
to activate this humility.

12
00:35:35,406 --> 00:35:42,194
Actually He came on this earth
first of all

13
00:35:44,155 --> 00:35:50,319
to create a space within us,
at the Agnya chakra,

14
00:35:51,636 --> 00:35:59,062
by removing the hurdles of the ego,
hurdles of the ego.

15
00:36:01,546 --> 00:36:05,662
He had to talk of humility that time,

16
00:36:05,862 --> 00:36:11,284
because Romans were ruling and they
were very arrogant,

17
00:36:11,484 --> 00:36:20,500
very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped,
we should say, not at all evolved.

18
00:36:20,722 --> 00:36:28,555
Like, you can say some of the animals,
which came into being

19
00:36:28,757 --> 00:36:33,883
and were thrown out of the evolutionary
process later on because they were useless,

20
00:36:34,084 --> 00:36:41,955
too aggressive or too big for their size
or some sort of a thing like that.

21
00:36:42,155 --> 00:36:45,358
In the same way Romans were.

22
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:52,357
If you see their body, even now,
painted sometimes,

23
00:36:52,557 --> 00:36:56,522
you’ll find that it was not like
a human body, it was like

24
00:36:56,723 --> 00:37:00,276
some animals you see, the muscles
and all that was very grotesque.

25
00:37:00,476 --> 00:37:07,920
There was no softness, no roundishness,
on their faces.

26
00:37:08,252 --> 00:37:15,519
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

27
00:37:15,719 --> 00:37:21,233
because when you have somebody
as an ideal before you,

28
00:37:21,433 --> 00:37:29,209
and always people see who dominates them,
and then such a person becomes their ideal.

29
00:37:29,409 --> 00:37:35,774
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

30
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:40,828
You see, somebody who is condescending,
you also become suddenly condescending.

31
00:37:41,028 --> 00:37:44,462
You see somebody who is very egoistical
and tries to show off,

32
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:50,204
you also put up air. You can see this
everyday happening,

33
00:37:50,405 --> 00:37:57,991
that a boss comes in who is a very,
very airy person,

34
00:37:58,192 --> 00:38:01,472
everybody in the office is like that.

35
00:38:02,787 --> 00:38:05,998
And that’s how Romans affected the people
in those days

36
00:38:06,198 --> 00:38:09,002
by creating their own ideals, people
thought they are the ideals,

37
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:17,155
they are the best, because they had
produced results according to them.

38
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:21,784
They were so powerful, they thought
this was the power.

39
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:27,555
And that’s why they followed their methods,
many people who were not even Romans.

40
00:38:27,755 --> 00:38:33,077
The another humbler group was
affected because

41
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:36,848
they were hurt, their ego was hurt.

42
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:41,147
So they became equally violent

43
00:38:41,348 --> 00:38:46,321
in the sense that they were so touchy
that you could not say anything to them,

44
00:38:46,522 --> 00:38:52,459
they would just come and bark on you,
frightened people.

45
00:38:54,186 --> 00:38:59,551
This kind of character is very dangerous
also,

46
00:38:59,813 --> 00:39:04,890
because that gives you some sort of very
bad diseases: can give you leprosy,

47
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:07,882
people develop leprosy with that kind
of character,

48
00:39:08,082 --> 00:39:10,505
if you develop a barking temperament

49
00:39:10,705 --> 00:39:15,034
of a nature by which you just jump
at people.

50
00:39:15,234 --> 00:39:21,626
Nerves become absolutely
sort of shattered by it,

51
00:39:21,827 --> 00:39:27,257
and the leprosy is the disease
of the nerves.

52
00:39:27,457 --> 00:39:33,512
Those people who always keep themselves
under such strain

53
00:39:33,972 --> 00:39:36,660
and jump at every person who comes
along

54
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:41,676
are very dangerously placed as far
as their nerves are concerned.

55
00:39:44,792 --> 00:39:50,442
And then a horrible type of virus
you know that which creates leprosy

56
00:39:50,643 --> 00:39:56,114
attacks these nerves, can attack because
they are very vulnerable,

57
00:39:56,315 --> 00:40:00,017
these kind of people who jump
on the others.

58
00:40:00,219 --> 00:40:03,055
That’s why there was so much leprosy,
in that small little place

59
00:40:03,256 --> 00:40:09,442
there were so many lepers, because
their nerves were shattered.

60
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:17,043
In those circumstances Christ was born.

61
00:40:17,243 --> 00:40:20,897
But He was not only born just for Romans
or for anyone,

62
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:23,873
but He was born for the whole world.

63
00:40:24,073 --> 00:40:29,405
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

64
00:40:29,606 --> 00:40:34,910
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

65
00:40:35,348 --> 00:40:41,242
And that demarcated the way human
beings were going on.

66
00:40:41,443 --> 00:40:47,912
So they had to be controlled first of all,

67
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:51,810
and Christ had to come at a time where

68
00:40:52,011 --> 00:40:57,641
a balance between ego and superego
was to be established.

69
00:41:01,269 --> 00:41:03,566
So the first thing that was said
about Christ throughout

70
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:10,520
in all these music and songs you have
heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth.’

71
00:41:13,379 --> 00:41:17,871
He came to create peace on earth.

72
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:25,517
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

73
00:41:25,717 --> 00:41:29,488
secondly when you are Realized.

74
00:41:29,689 --> 00:41:33,139
Both things should be there. If only you
get your Realization

75
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:38,520
and there is no balance in you,
there cannot be peace.

76
00:41:39,106 --> 00:41:47,369
But peace never means in any way,
is a personality that recedes back,

77
00:41:47,569 --> 00:41:52,102
runs away from situations,
escapist,

78
00:41:52,302 --> 00:41:57,477
who does not want to face the reality -
never means that.

79
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:05,192
Christ is pictured very differently
from what He was.

80
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:09,070
He was the healthiest personality
you could think of,

81
00:42:09,273 --> 00:42:13,659
and the humblest man you could
think of.

82
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:19,934
And He would not stand any nonsense,
nobody could take liberties with Him.

83
00:42:20,135 --> 00:42:24,570
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

84
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:31,278
Extremely compassionate, extremely
kind, but very powerful.

85
00:42:31,479 --> 00:42:34,590
This is the balance.

86
00:42:38,406 --> 00:42:42,569
So He came on this earth to create
peace within our minds.

87
00:42:42,770 --> 00:42:46,569
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

88
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,631
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

89
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:56,859
When this peace will be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

90
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,051
Human beings are violent to each other.

91
00:43:02,724 --> 00:43:07,327
Ego developed subtler ways and
subtler ways.

92
00:43:07,528 --> 00:43:14,784
Then, provocative ways started
coming up also from the superego,

93
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:21,114
sly methods from the superego.
The conflict started.

94
00:43:22,818 --> 00:43:29,200
And at that time, to overcome
that conflict,

95
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:35,763
the best thing was to create a space
in Agnya,

96
00:43:35,964 --> 00:43:40,082
in the center, in thoughtless awareness.

97
00:43:41,212 --> 00:43:45,309
That’s how Christ had to come
on this earth.

98
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:51,778
The birth is very, very symbolic.

99
00:43:53,146 --> 00:44:01,803
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya,
He’s nothing but the Word as you call it,

100
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:07,247
Logos – I don’t know what all words
you have got in language,

101
00:44:07,447 --> 00:44:11,881
the Shabda, as they call it,
is the Aumkara –

102
00:44:12,081 --> 00:44:18,910
He was to be born in this way, because
He had no body,

103
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,762
and the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

104
00:44:28,043 --> 00:44:36,436
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

105
00:44:36,676 --> 00:44:41,289
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger, for people,

106
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:50,645
that look at this: the King of Heaven
should…

107
00:44:51,911 --> 00:44:55,286
[Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Now she does
that to understand.

108
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:05,958
(To the little girl who wants again
something:) Don’t go near that.]

109
00:45:12,558 --> 00:45:25,692
So the story of His birth was very
interesting tale.

110
00:45:28,208 --> 00:45:35,207
It was very symbolic that He came
in a humble place,

111
00:45:36,612 --> 00:45:39,834
because people were so proud
of their money,

112
00:45:40,035 --> 00:45:44,483
so arrogant because of their power
that they had.

113
00:45:44,683 --> 00:45:49,129
Even today all the Christian nations
are like that.

114
00:45:49,473 --> 00:45:53,644
Surprisingly, Christian nations should be
so arrogant

115
00:45:53,807 --> 00:46:01,926
and so power-drunk and think no end
of themselves because they are affluent.

116
00:46:03,752 --> 00:46:08,249
Think of the Christian nations being
very poor,

117
00:46:08,450 --> 00:46:12,254
do you think they would have had
racial problem?

118
00:46:15,237 --> 00:46:21,801
They don’t have racial problems
with Arabs. Not at all.

119
00:46:23,598 --> 00:46:27,975
As simple as that. No problem with Arabs.

120
00:46:28,157 --> 00:46:33,613
They have no race, Arabs have no race,
they have money, money race.

121
00:46:33,917 --> 00:46:39,214
Those people who hanker after money
are only bowing down to money.

122
00:46:39,534 --> 00:46:43,800
They have no respect for anything
else but for money.

123
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:53,372
Those who have money and think
of money

124
00:46:53,573 --> 00:47:00,956
are another lot which is going to go out
of the circulation of evolution.

125
00:47:01,156 --> 00:47:04,581
They are going out already.

126
00:47:04,964 --> 00:47:09,263
The second lot is the one which was
like Romans.

127
00:47:09,464 --> 00:47:15,487
They had a fall, they were all finished
because they were power-drunk.

128
00:47:15,706 --> 00:47:24,299
They drank away, their civilization
completely finished off and they are out.

129
00:47:26,471 --> 00:47:29,849
You’ve seen Portugal, you’ll be amazed,
it’s happening there.

130
00:47:30,049 --> 00:47:34,251
The ego of Portuguese was so great,
you can’t believe

131
00:47:34,451 --> 00:47:38,998
that that country is a desolate country,
there’s nothing now,

132
00:47:39,199 --> 00:47:43,377
big-big, huge big buildings, which you see

133
00:47:43,577 --> 00:47:46,394
and you know they must have been rich
once upon a time.

134
00:47:46,594 --> 00:47:49,266
And there’s nothing left with them
except for their antique shops

135
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:52,499
which are never open.

136
00:47:53,508 --> 00:48:00,706
This kind of a ego is again revived

137
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:12,057
and that revival came up, imagine,
in the name of Christ. Imagine!

138
00:48:13,792 --> 00:48:18,893
They purchased people to be
converted as Christians.

139
00:48:19,286 --> 00:48:21,031
They gave them money,

140
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:27,534
is all money, money propositions,
money enterprise going on.

141
00:48:29,893 --> 00:48:34,725
Jews the same, then the Christians
the same.

142
00:48:34,926 --> 00:48:38,615
He was born in a manger.

143
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:49,917
For a little child to be put in a manger
by the Mahalakshmi, it’s too much.

144
00:48:50,323 --> 00:48:52,719
See how symbolic it is, Mahalakshmi,

145
00:48:52,919 --> 00:49:00,901
was not Lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi to put
the child in the manger.

146
00:49:02,284 --> 00:49:04,605
No place.

147
00:49:04,805 --> 00:49:12,739
We have at least Chelsham Road,
Warwick Road,

148
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:20,003
Bramham Gardens, Brompton Square.

149
00:49:22,784 --> 00:49:26,575
But the child was born and was put
in the manger,

150
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:31,440
the humblest thing in this world
is a manger.

151
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:37,503
The humblest of all, a crib,

152
00:49:37,831 --> 00:49:42,266
the Highest is put in the manger.

153
00:49:46,393 --> 00:49:49,339
So, what do we do?

154
00:49:50,061 --> 00:49:52,239
We think we should also sleep in a manger,

155
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:58,770
we’ll become like Christ. There are people
who believe in such nonsensical things.

156
00:49:58,971 --> 00:50:02,494
They think that, you see if they have
all the money,

157
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:06,628
they drink and do all kinds of things,
you see -

158
00:50:06,936 --> 00:50:10,425
I met one man one day,

159
00:50:11,186 --> 00:50:15,628
he was all drunk lying near a church.

160
00:50:16,370 --> 00:50:19,038
He was saying: “I’m Christ, I’m Christ.”

161
00:50:19,238 --> 00:50:25,011
He must have had got this idea that
he’s lying there because he’s very humble.

162
00:50:25,485 --> 00:50:29,883
This kind of ridiculous caricature

163
00:50:30,084 --> 00:50:36,234
of the whole beautiful symbol is followed
everywhere.

164
00:50:41,534 --> 00:50:46,440
So the arrogant and the egoistical might
say that: “Why, if He was the King,

165
00:50:46,641 --> 00:50:52,415
why was He born in the manger?
Why was He kept in the manger?”.

166
00:50:52,616 --> 00:50:56,698
Everybody will have their own concept.

167
00:50:59,178 --> 00:51:04,793
Even there are people in India, who are
stupid people, not wise,

168
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:10,675
who say that He must have done lots
of bad karmas to be born like that.

169
00:51:12,206 --> 00:51:20,669
Because to them, karmas give you more
money, I mean, God is not so unintelligent.

170
00:51:20,870 --> 00:51:27,487
If you do good karmas you become men
of God, you become seekers.

171
00:51:30,761 --> 00:51:35,636
You get the blessings of God by your good
karmas, you’ll become religious people,

172
00:51:35,836 --> 00:51:39,927
not moneyed people who can go to pubs
and waste their lives.

173
00:51:40,128 --> 00:51:45,524
 This is the idea they have got that
by doing good karmas you become rich,

174
00:51:45,725 --> 00:51:52,612
and become even worse for next life.
Some people may believe like that.

175
00:51:54,152 --> 00:51:58,793
But He never did any karmas.
He was in akarma Himself,

176
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:01,749
so no question of His punishment
and all that,

177
00:52:01,949 --> 00:52:06,200
because just a drama, but very
symbolic it is.

178
00:52:06,401 --> 00:52:12,866
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort.

179
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:18,584
Can there be any comfort in a manger?
Think like that.

180
00:52:18,785 --> 00:52:23,432
All the Christian nations are after
their comforts.

181
00:52:25,945 --> 00:52:28,440
Aren’t we?

182
00:52:29,221 --> 00:52:34,495
What we think is not comfortable,
it should be comfortable.

183
00:52:34,716 --> 00:52:42,198
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages of Christ’s birth.

184
00:52:45,234 --> 00:52:48,753
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ,

185
00:52:48,954 --> 00:52:52,706
because He was born in a manger.

186
00:52:53,266 --> 00:52:57,190
No comfort was provided for Him.

187
00:53:00,312 --> 00:53:05,531
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

188
00:53:05,731 --> 00:53:09,942
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

189
00:53:10,143 --> 00:53:14,652
Copying Him is not the way, is not
the way by copying Him

190
00:53:14,853 --> 00:53:20,621
that you will become Christ, but
by imbibing His qualities within you.

191
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:23,159
I’ve known people who live in a pigsty,

192
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:28,786
but once they get to a better life
they want everything else.

193
00:53:30,523 --> 00:53:40,284
So imbibing the quality of humility
and adjustment.

194
00:53:46,268 --> 00:53:49,815
Humility and adjustment.

195
00:53:52,721 --> 00:53:56,610
Anywhere you are put, anytime.

196
00:53:56,811 --> 00:54:02,638
Very particular about time. If somebody
has to come at ten o’clock,

197
00:54:02,839 --> 00:54:06,075
and if he has to do a job, if it is
[that] he’s delayed by five minutes,

198
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:12,104
he starts breaking all the heavens,
just can’t bear it,

199
00:54:13,246 --> 00:54:16,992
he can’t bear it, five minutes he has
to wait.

200
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:21,096
And if he has to wait ten minutes,
he’s out for a pub, finished.

201
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:26,427
He cannot be pacifying himself unless
and until he takes a drink.

202
00:54:26,628 --> 00:54:31,905
This is the situation of a volcanic
human mind.

203
00:54:35,818 --> 00:54:39,241
So the peace has to come.

204
00:54:43,046 --> 00:54:48,008
How? If you seek comfort you’ll become
lazy lumps.

205
00:54:48,209 --> 00:54:52,694
You’ll sleep off, you’ll be lotus-eaters.

206
00:54:53,792 --> 00:54:59,812
But if you not seek comfort, then
peace will come.

207
00:55:04,255 --> 00:55:07,564
Because for our own comfort, for our
selfish comfort

208
00:55:07,765 --> 00:55:10,825
of this body we torture everybody else.

209
00:55:11,025 --> 00:55:14,312
The other day only I was telling that
only in the Western countries it is so,

210
00:55:14,521 --> 00:55:16,999
not in India.

211
00:55:17,521 --> 00:55:19,818
If somebody’s sleeping even till twelve
o’clock

212
00:55:19,995 --> 00:55:25,123
you cannot wake up that person,
is a irreligious act.

213
00:55:25,324 --> 00:55:28,095
I mean in India anybody who sleeps
after six o’clock

214
00:55:28,296 --> 00:55:31,319
he’ll feel ashamed of himself to be
sleeping that time.

215
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:33,476
He’ll be apologetic the whole day

216
00:55:33,676 --> 00:55:35,248
and he’ll say that, “Oh, God, I’m sorry
I slept.”

217
00:55:35,448 --> 00:55:41,484
It’s regarded as sinful to sleep so late
as six o’clock in the morning.

218
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:45,452
I mean, any country like that.

219
00:55:51,914 --> 00:55:57,459
So comfort has no end. There’s no end
to it.

220
00:55:57,659 --> 00:56:03,781
Comfort crawls upon you, what is comfort?
Let us see, very simple.

221
00:56:03,982 --> 00:56:08,203
In Christ’s symbolic life, its very deep
significance is this:

222
00:56:08,404 --> 00:56:13,261
that comfort is nothing but the matter
overpowering the Spirit.

223
00:56:13,462 --> 00:56:16,143
Do you see that point?

224
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:19,704
If you are sitting on a chair, then
you can’t sit on the ground.

225
00:56:19,904 --> 00:56:22,831
If you are sitting on a sofa set you
can’t sit on a chair.

226
00:56:23,031 --> 00:56:27,228
If you are sitting on a velvet, then you
cannot sit you know on an ordinary thing.

227
00:56:27,429 --> 00:56:31,407
Is the matter always overpowering
the Spirit and He was the Spirit,

228
00:56:31,608 --> 00:56:36,398
what does it matter to Him? Whether
straw or anything?

229
00:56:42,663 --> 00:56:47,691
It is insurmountable, nothing can
displease the Spirit

230
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:53,054
of these material things, I mean the matter
otherwise will take over.

231
00:56:57,120 --> 00:57:01,191
That is the thing is, one has
to understand,

232
00:57:03,507 --> 00:57:06,056
that He was the Spirit and if you have
to become the Spirit,

233
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:10,967
first of all, try to give up your comforts,
lash your bodies a little bit,

234
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,736
I’m sorry on a Christmas day I have
to say that,

235
00:57:13,936 --> 00:57:16,444
because He was also lashed that way.

236
00:57:16,645 --> 00:57:21,345
If you see on the day He was born,
for a mother to put the child

237
00:57:21,546 --> 00:57:27,319
in a crip that was a manger is too much
of a sacrifice.

238
00:57:29,055 --> 00:57:31,227
How much you want to do for your
children, you see,

239
00:57:31,428 --> 00:57:35,384
dress them up properly, do this, do that.

240
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:40,445
But the child was to be put in a manger,
was put in a manger,

241
00:57:40,645 --> 00:57:49,030
just for you people to learn that comfort
crawls on the Spirit.

242
00:57:51,890 --> 00:57:58,299
We always seek the comfort. This one
thing is the message to all of us.

243
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:04,126
If you seek your room, “I must have
a bathroom attached to that.”

244
00:58:04,327 --> 00:58:10,632
Again comfort. “What about my wife,
where is she going to sleep?”

245
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:18,124
She’ll sleep as others are sleeping.
And you’ll sleep as others are sleeping.

246
00:58:19,601 --> 00:58:24,452
Nobody is going to die of that be sure,
I can assure you.

247
00:58:24,653 --> 00:58:27,045
Sahaj Yoga is very hard thing that way
you see,

248
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:31,101
very few people die once they come
to Sahaj Yoga.

249
00:58:32,784 --> 00:58:38,694
Some of them should. But they don’t.

250
00:58:39,257 --> 00:58:41,927
They continue, they go on giving
Realization,

251
00:58:42,127 --> 00:58:46,507
they go on doing everything, still
they continue.

252
00:58:48,228 --> 00:58:55,468
Escape all the accidents, escape
all the problems and they continue.

253
00:58:57,718 --> 00:59:02,226
But this is a short time which must
be used.

254
00:59:02,426 --> 00:59:06,632
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

255
00:59:06,832 --> 00:59:11,067
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth,
be happy about it, sing songs,

256
00:59:11,267 --> 00:59:14,473
go into a mood like that, but really
I tell you,

257
00:59:14,673 --> 00:59:25,812
it’s a very symbolic case for all of us
to know that He slept in a manger.

258
00:59:26,282 --> 00:59:32,218
And the another symbolicism is that,
what did we offer Him?

259
00:59:32,905 --> 00:59:36,826
What did this world offer Him at that time?

260
00:59:37,027 --> 00:59:43,048
The another symbolicism is that they
offered Him a manger.

261
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:50,372
Are we going to do the same to our Mother?

262
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:59,851
This is one thing one has to know.

263
01:00:01,952 --> 01:00:06,861
Manger is, after all, is all right,
it doesn’t catches anything,

264
01:00:07,062 --> 01:00:10,966
it has no left Nabhi, right Nabhi, nothing.

265
01:00:11,166 --> 01:00:15,499
It doesn’t have all these problems.
There are no thorns,

266
01:00:15,700 --> 01:00:22,568
there’s no Agnya, there’s nobody
screwing up into Your stomach,

267
01:00:22,769 --> 01:00:28,124
suddenly feel, “Oh God, don’t want
to see”.

268
01:00:28,831 --> 01:00:36,726
So you are the thistles in that manger
which have to be soft

269
01:00:37,038 --> 01:00:40,351
to give comfort to Christ.

270
01:00:40,703 --> 01:00:49,257
You have to become so soft and so sweet,
so clean and pure,

271
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:55,671
because a new babe is going to be put
in the manger.

272
01:00:59,347 --> 01:01:03,553
You are the kushas, is the thistle.

273
01:01:04,428 --> 01:01:08,365
And for a yogi the kushasana is the one
who sits on the kusha only.

274
01:01:08,589 --> 01:01:11,167
So He was a yogi, He came on the kusha,
all right.

275
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:19,269
But now, what about you? To receive
Him in the manger, this is the manger.

276
01:01:20,093 --> 01:01:23,654
The Mother is preparing the manger

277
01:01:23,855 --> 01:01:32,519
to make the child feel very happy
and comforted, the thistles.

278
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:43,095
Adamance, obstinacy, harshness, ugliness:

279
01:01:47,893 --> 01:01:51,452
all must be curbed down.

280
01:01:53,411 --> 01:01:57,664
It’s very symbolic, it’s very symbolic
I must say His birth;

281
01:01:57,864 --> 01:02:02,530
why, why, one should think, why was He
born like that?

282
01:02:04,882 --> 01:02:07,669
People might give any amount
of interpretations,

283
01:02:07,869 --> 01:02:11,382
but I know because I’ve done it.

284
01:02:13,742 --> 01:02:17,305
I’m trying to soften you, I’m trying
to mold you,

285
01:02:17,506 --> 01:02:20,640
sometimes I have to be harsh with you.

286
01:02:20,959 --> 01:02:26,824
Sometimes I have to be angry with you,
sometimes I have to tell you off.

287
01:02:27,024 --> 01:02:32,218
Just now there are some who are catching
so much on the Void,

288
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:35,874
that My stomach is screwing up.

289
01:02:37,451 --> 01:02:41,142
It’s all right with Me, cause I’m supposed
to be that,

290
01:02:41,342 --> 01:02:44,773
I’m so fortunate that I have to face
all that.

291
01:02:44,973 --> 01:02:48,708
But what about Christ within us?

292
01:02:50,249 --> 01:02:55,199
You are not going to be happy
with yourself,

293
01:02:55,832 --> 01:02:58,804
with your being, with your Spirit,

294
01:02:59,004 --> 01:03:05,752
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

295
01:03:10,175 --> 01:03:14,328
You yourself you are not going to enjoy.

296
01:03:14,552 --> 01:03:19,025
You think that by justifying your egos,
by justifying your arrogance,

297
01:03:19,225 --> 01:03:22,565
by justifying all that you are doing
to each other -

298
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:26,736
some people are busy making money
out of Sahaj Yoga, some people are busy

299
01:03:26,937 --> 01:03:30,333
deceiving others, some are telling lies,
some are creating problems,

300
01:03:30,533 --> 01:03:33,431
some are beating wives and some wives
are provocating husbands,

301
01:03:33,632 --> 01:03:36,769
what is all this going on?

302
01:03:37,408 --> 01:03:41,780
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

303
01:03:43,408 --> 01:03:49,819
to create the peace on earth.
We have to be peaceful!

304
01:03:51,025 --> 01:03:58,766
To be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

305
01:03:59,918 --> 01:04:04,413
If you become humble, peace will come.

306
01:04:04,750 --> 01:04:09,577
Humble is a good word, I don’t know
if it explains what it means.

307
01:04:11,060 --> 01:04:17,663
Humble means: “Not asking for your
own comfort, but comfort of others”.

308
01:04:19,207 --> 01:04:22,913
When others are before you,

309
01:04:26,551 --> 01:04:30,871
that is humility. It’s not: “Thank you
very much.”

310
01:04:31,072 --> 01:04:35,634
You kill somebody and then tell to the dead
person: “I’m sorry I killed you” – finished.

311
01:04:35,835 --> 01:04:40,728
In English language is over. Once
you have said: “I’m sorry,” finished.

312
01:04:40,928 --> 01:04:46,983
“Yes, I know,” and the another is “I know.”
“Why did you do it?” “I know”. Finished.

313
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:54,710
If he knows, then it’s all right.
Then there’s no punishment. No.

314
01:04:56,810 --> 01:05:00,257
You don’t know,

315
01:05:01,195 --> 01:05:05,616
you are all the Spirit, so beautiful.

316
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:11,069
You are to be chiseled out, all right,
that’s My job.

317
01:05:11,270 --> 01:05:14,247
You are to be cleaned out, that’s My job,
all right.

318
01:05:14,447 --> 01:05:22,679
Kundalini awakening is My job, agreed,
but maintenance is yours.

319
01:05:24,963 --> 01:05:28,968
On the contrary sometimes I feel,

320
01:05:30,116 --> 01:05:34,655
because I do all this, the maintenance
is poor, very, very poor.

321
01:05:34,855 --> 01:05:40,312
Like in India I see some people try
to help us, by giving us money, you see.

322
01:05:40,512 --> 01:05:43,431
 We didn’t earn the money ourselves,
you see, somebody donated money

323
01:05:43,632 --> 01:05:49,547
and they built some wells, all are
dilapidated and finished,

324
01:05:49,748 --> 01:05:56,138
free gift, nobody wants to look after it.
It’s human nature.

325
01:05:56,339 --> 01:05:59,993
If you don’t work hard for your
maintenance,

326
01:06:00,194 --> 01:06:02,416
and just leave it to Mother, “Oh,
She will cure us,

327
01:06:02,616 --> 01:06:06,799
let us continue what we want to do,
She’s coming after all,

328
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:10,468
She’s going to look after us”,
we’ll lag behind.

329
01:06:10,668 --> 01:06:17,560
That’s why My presence can be sometimes
in a way not so fruitful.

330
01:06:17,761 --> 01:06:21,265
My presence in England

331
01:06:23,807 --> 01:06:27,140
is good up to a point,

332
01:06:27,865 --> 01:06:33,179
and afterwards it should not be there
for some time.

333
01:06:35,444 --> 01:06:38,105
I love you very much, you know that,
very much.

334
01:06:38,305 --> 01:06:42,050
I - England is My heart, and I have
to be here,

335
01:06:42,250 --> 01:06:46,503
and this Christmas I wanted to celebrate
with you and the New Year with you

336
01:06:46,703 --> 01:06:51,384
just out of My own desire. But I have
to make you understand

337
01:06:51,585 --> 01:06:59,241
that you have to work harder and harder
to keep yourself clean.

338
01:07:00,427 --> 01:07:06,920
Get rid of your problems, come up,
do not say that,

339
01:07:07,121 --> 01:07:11,610
“Yes, it is like this Mother.” All the time
you are reporting to Me,

340
01:07:11,811 --> 01:07:14,158
“Still Mother I’m catching, see now
this is happening,”

341
01:07:14,359 --> 01:07:18,312
as if it’s a boastful thing to say.

342
01:07:19,541 --> 01:07:23,515
“I will get all right, I have to be
all right,

343
01:07:23,715 --> 01:07:28,429
now Mother has gone, let Me show Her
when I come back”.

344
01:07:31,741 --> 01:07:34,789
When I once went to Bombay, Raulbai
did not come to see Me

345
01:07:34,989 --> 01:07:38,349
for seven days and she was in Bombay,
she had arrived to see Me.

346
01:07:38,554 --> 01:07:42,182
So I asked them, “What’s the matter,
is she keeping all right, is she all right?

347
01:07:42,382 --> 01:07:47,796
Then why didn’t she come to see Me?”
I was thinking what’s the matter with her.

348
01:07:48,890 --> 01:07:51,890
She came to see Me after seven days.
She said, “Mother, I’m sorry

349
01:07:52,091 --> 01:07:54,737
I didn’t come to see You because
I was caught up this time,

350
01:07:54,937 --> 01:07:59,038
I wanted to cleanse myself before showing
My face to You.”

351
01:08:04,259 --> 01:08:09,771
So, cleansing is to be done, maintenance
is to be done,

352
01:08:09,971 --> 01:08:16,991
raising of the Kundalini, collectivity,
collectivity:

353
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:20,228
look after each other, you have to only
support Sahaj Yogis

354
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:24,311
and not others, outsiders, they are
outsiders, they are not us,

355
01:08:24,512 --> 01:08:27,248
we are Sahaj Yogis, and those who try
to support others

356
01:08:27,448 --> 01:08:33,135
are no more Sahaj Yogis, they get out
of Sahaj Yoga would be better for us.

357
01:08:33,336 --> 01:08:37,038
Whatever we are, we are among ourselves.

358
01:08:37,239 --> 01:08:40,057
Outsiders are outsiders, we have to love
each other,

359
01:08:40,257 --> 01:08:43,193
we have to respect each other as saints.

360
01:08:43,393 --> 01:08:47,596
Nobody has to say anything harsh things
to each other. No.

361
01:08:47,797 --> 01:08:51,507
Be kind, loving, affectionate.

362
01:08:52,343 --> 01:08:56,756
Curb down your tongues, be humble.

363
01:08:56,983 --> 01:09:02,731
Humility, humility is the thing one
has to be.

364
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:08,734
Write it down with big words, be humble,
be humble, be humble.

365
01:09:11,577 --> 01:09:18,851
And when you become humble, such peace
will reign,

366
01:09:21,364 --> 01:09:25,755
and you will feel so nice, being humble,
there’s nothing wrong.

367
01:09:25,955 --> 01:09:27,977
Christ has gone to this extent to say

368
01:09:28,177 --> 01:09:32,888
that somebody slaps on this face you turn
the other. Be humble.

369
01:09:33,088 --> 01:09:36,898
With Romans there was no other way out.

370
01:09:42,204 --> 01:09:46,364
There was no other way out. Also,
He preached humility,

371
01:09:46,564 --> 01:09:50,476
throughout He preached humility.

372
01:09:50,676 --> 01:09:53,189
You be humble to each other, that’s all.

373
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:55,827
You need not be humble to others, because

374
01:09:56,028 --> 01:09:59,823
no one can now torture the saints, is over,
that situation is over,

375
01:10:00,024 --> 01:10:03,124
but you be humble to each other.

376
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:11,476
Humble in your demands of life.

377
01:10:11,706 --> 01:10:14,776
That doesn’t mean that you should
become people

378
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:18,758
[Aside: Just keep it there.] Just that
you become people

379
01:10:18,959 --> 01:10:24,411
of a strange characters, you see,

380
01:10:24,612 --> 01:10:30,215
that doesn’t mean that, should be
decent, with decorum,

381
01:10:30,416 --> 01:10:38,069
as Christ was when He was born.
But you should be humble.

382
01:10:38,494 --> 01:10:42,384
Try to mould your bodies, make them
lighter

383
01:10:42,584 --> 01:10:46,033
in the sense that you can sit anywhere,
you can move anywhere,

384
01:10:46,234 --> 01:10:50,921
you can lie everywhere - you are all
young people,

385
01:10:51,826 --> 01:10:54,710
adjust yourself.

386
01:10:54,977 --> 01:10:56,852
If somebody has one room you should say,

387
01:10:57,062 --> 01:11:00,843
“All right, doesn’t matter, I can live
in the corridor, don’t worry.”

388
01:11:01,129 --> 01:11:04,020
But they will be first jumping,
I’ve seen that,

389
01:11:04,221 --> 01:11:08,215
to the room which has the attached bath.

390
01:11:08,448 --> 01:11:11,177
How many of you have rooms with
attached baths, let’s see?

391
01:11:11,377 --> 01:11:16,171
Raise the hands, living in the ashram.

392
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:24,343
Better give up. Better give up.

393
01:11:24,798 --> 01:11:28,091
See now? Better give up.

394
01:11:28,292 --> 01:11:33,117
All of you give up your rooms and stay
in rooms which are shared.

395
01:11:33,318 --> 01:11:36,569
Now it’s all right for you not to share
because you are husband and wife,

396
01:11:36,769 --> 01:11:40,218
but need not ask for attached bath.

397
01:11:46,467 --> 01:11:49,367
Comforts are to be given up for others,
not for you.

398
01:11:49,567 --> 01:11:54,413
You should make others comfortable,
not yourself.

399
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:02,417
Sometimes I’m surprised at human beings
how they allow others to eat anything,

400
01:12:02,617 --> 01:12:07,239
the way they are self-centered is
something surprising.

401
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:13,025
But after Sahaj Yoga you change!
You enjoy giving comfort to others,

402
01:12:13,226 --> 01:12:19,749
saying comforting words to others,
sweet things to others, you enjoy that!

403
01:12:20,094 --> 01:12:26,027
Christ was given the crib of a manger

404
01:12:26,227 --> 01:12:31,152
and He came to comfort you, to give
you peace

405
01:12:31,352 --> 01:12:37,736
and He came as a Saviour, can you
imagine the contrast?

406
01:12:37,936 --> 01:12:44,559
You are the saviours of the whole
universe now, as He was Saviour.

407
01:12:44,759 --> 01:12:51,289
But, you cannot be selfish, you cannot
be comfortable.

408
01:12:51,489 --> 01:12:53,978
You have to be like Christ, He used
to live wherever He liked:

409
01:12:54,178 --> 01:12:58,280
He lived in forest, He lived anywhere.

410
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:05,609
Just working hard for people, He would
never even have His food sometimes.

411
01:13:07,769 --> 01:13:14,180
He lived under all circumstances,
under all conditions;

412
01:13:14,381 --> 01:13:18,952
He never asked for any comfort, nothing.

413
01:13:20,234 --> 01:13:24,317
He was a carpenter, He never even
used a glove.

414
01:13:24,517 --> 01:13:27,874
Here you must have gloves.

415
01:13:29,097 --> 01:13:33,113
You must have socks, you must have shoes,

416
01:13:33,313 --> 01:13:36,931
you must have a shaving this, He never
shaved even,

417
01:13:37,132 --> 01:13:40,702
that doesn’t mean you grow your beard.

418
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:50,312
But He was a very clean person.

419
01:13:56,110 --> 01:14:02,038
He lived with the minimum of minimum, that’s
what one has to do, is to reduce things.

420
01:14:03,249 --> 01:14:05,756
You know, I have everything that one
can think of,

421
01:14:05,956 --> 01:14:11,163
but I can live with the minimum of minimum,
I can live with two saris,

422
01:14:11,392 --> 01:14:14,538
and sometimes with one.

423
01:14:15,921 --> 01:14:21,819
You should be able to live with minimum
of minimum, that’s the point is.

424
01:14:26,081 --> 01:14:30,218
And that is what one has to learn
from His life is

425
01:14:30,419 --> 01:14:34,205
that we are the saviours today,

426
01:14:34,406 --> 01:14:41,565
and Saviour lived just like a humble
person,

427
01:14:41,765 --> 01:14:47,228
very elite in His behavior, very dignified.

428
01:14:47,428 --> 01:14:49,888
He was not behaving like a beggar going,
“heh, heh, heh,” like that.

429
01:14:50,089 --> 01:14:52,977
some of them, you are like that also,
you see, you go about like this,

430
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:58,062
when you talk, like this you go about,
that’s not the way!

431
01:14:58,263 --> 01:15:05,099
With dignity, with your magnificence,
with your gravity, move about.

432
01:15:05,299 --> 01:15:12,273
Actually those who are really great,
those who are the real emperors,

433
01:15:12,473 --> 01:15:16,799
do not need anything. Ah, what can
dominate them, tell Me?

434
01:15:16,999 --> 01:15:19,435
If you are the emperor of this world,

435
01:15:19,635 --> 01:15:21,875
if you know you are the queen
of this world,

436
01:15:22,076 --> 01:15:26,683
what is more important, what comfort
can dominate?

437
01:15:26,884 --> 01:15:33,029
What material thing can charm such
a person?

438
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:37,945
Because that person is above, that’s
badshah, that’s the king,

439
01:15:38,145 --> 01:15:44,053
that’s the real sign of a king,
king of heaven,

440
01:15:44,254 --> 01:15:49,431
not of England, or of any place,
but of heaven.

441
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:55,012
And that’s what you are, you are
the citizens of that kingdom,

442
01:15:55,212 --> 01:16:01,937
to you these things should be absolutely
useless.

443
01:16:04,333 --> 01:16:11,351
The beauty of the matter should be seen,
not the possession of it.

444
01:16:13,829 --> 01:16:16,245
Beauty is the comfort,

445
01:16:16,445 --> 01:16:20,106
not what you feel in the body, like
having comfortable things.

446
01:16:20,306 --> 01:16:24,944
Beauty is so comforting, people do not know

447
01:16:25,282 --> 01:16:28,530
how comforting is the beauty.

448
01:16:30,799 --> 01:16:35,914
And that I’m sure while we are celebrating
His birth today,

449
01:16:36,114 --> 01:16:46,066
we glorify Him, by accepting a kind
of a martyr Spirit,

450
01:16:46,267 --> 01:16:50,163
a Spirit in which you are dedicated,

451
01:16:50,804 --> 01:16:54,687
in which you do not demand anything,
but you give.

452
01:16:54,888 --> 01:16:57,866
You do not ask for anything, but you give.

453
01:16:58,067 --> 01:17:01,897
Even today I received letter from people
saying that:

454
01:17:02,098 --> 01:17:09,655
“Please, I want a job, can you help Me,
will You bring?”.

455
01:17:10,602 --> 01:17:16,562
All sort of things like that. It can be
any sort of a nonsense.

456
01:17:16,763 --> 01:17:19,278
Of course, I mean, one can have
all that kind of thing,

457
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:25,034
but ask for one and that is the Spirit.

458
01:17:25,234 --> 01:17:28,507
And once you ask for that,

459
01:17:29,994 --> 01:17:34,864
nothing higher to what you’ve asked for.

460
01:17:35,065 --> 01:17:41,634
Then you don’t want anything else,
the enjoyment is complete.

461
01:17:41,835 --> 01:17:46,389
So to celebrate His birthday and to rejoice
in that,

462
01:17:46,589 --> 01:17:50,435
is to rejoice in our

463
01:17:52,657 --> 01:18:02,184
adequacies. If you are adequate you do not
hanker after your inadequacies, don’t you?

464
01:18:02,385 --> 01:18:06,499
If you are complete, if you are full,
if you are satisfied

465
01:18:06,699 --> 01:18:09,934
you do not hanker, do you?

466
01:18:10,527 --> 01:18:15,057
So enjoy your adequacies, your
completeness,

467
01:18:15,257 --> 01:18:25,512
your fullness, and your complete
satisfaction, enjoy that.

468
01:18:25,713 --> 01:18:29,116
Ultimately, all these things lead to some
sort of a satisfaction.

469
01:18:29,317 --> 01:18:32,724
Of course, I don’t know if you get
any satisfaction out of that,

470
01:18:32,924 --> 01:18:39,515
but the real satisfaction that is within
you is the Spirit, you enjoy that.

471
01:18:41,231 --> 01:18:47,128
This is for yourself, and for others
you are a comforter to others.

472
01:18:47,328 --> 01:18:50,999
It’s not that anybody who talks to you
will come and complain to Me:

473
01:18:51,200 --> 01:18:54,528
“Mother, he has bitten me.

474
01:18:55,786 --> 01:19:02,262
I had a meeting with another scorpion,
he bit me.

475
01:19:04,355 --> 01:19:08,770
I touched somebody and he hit me.”

476
01:19:11,072 --> 01:19:15,120
Comfort. You are a thing of comfort
to others,

477
01:19:15,321 --> 01:19:21,440
believe Me, you are. Comfort others.

478
01:19:24,203 --> 01:19:30,715
So those who comfort others do not
bother about their comfort.

479
01:19:30,916 --> 01:19:36,676
The shepherds, simple people,

480
01:19:36,877 --> 01:19:43,684
in this cold, imagine they were outside,
and they saw the vision of the angel.

481
01:19:43,885 --> 01:19:48,428
It can only be seen by people who
are humble,

482
01:19:48,676 --> 01:19:52,223
who are leading a humble life,

483
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:58,942
He appeared to them and the another
was, vision, to the Wise.

484
01:20:00,578 --> 01:20:03,461
So only the humble people and the wise
people -

485
01:20:03,661 --> 01:20:06,313
wisdom, common sense and wisdom.

486
01:20:06,513 --> 01:20:10,327
Those who are not wise can never
understand, can never understand,

487
01:20:10,527 --> 01:20:14,921
those who are intelligent and intellectuals
are not wise people at all,

488
01:20:15,122 --> 01:20:20,348
they are stupid, you know that they
are stupid people.

489
01:20:20,754 --> 01:20:27,985
Wisdom. So the three wise men and
the shepherd is another great symbolism,

490
01:20:28,185 --> 01:20:35,153
those who will understand Sahaja Yoga -
simple people, shepherds.

491
01:20:39,088 --> 01:20:42,598
And another are the wise.

492
01:20:44,395 --> 01:20:50,559
Only the wise can understand the star.

493
01:20:54,409 --> 01:20:57,661
So many must have seen the star.

494
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:01,689
Wise men from the East. It’s true.

495
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,934
Eastern people are much more wiser
than other people, no doubt about it.

496
01:21:06,134 --> 01:21:09,753
But why? Let’s see why they are wiser.

497
01:21:09,953 --> 01:21:16,637
Eastern are wiser, up to a point.

498
01:21:21,691 --> 01:21:26,684
In your body, there is East and West
if you see.

499
01:21:27,191 --> 01:21:35,669
East is left side and West is right side.

500
01:21:36,286 --> 01:21:45,247
Eastern are the left sided, nearer
the heart.

501
01:21:45,661 --> 01:21:49,421
But not the Eastern most are Japanese,
horrible people,

502
01:21:49,622 --> 01:21:55,796
Japanese, horrible, then the - all these
people who are selling you

503
01:21:55,997 --> 01:21:59,125
these drugs and all that, they are
worst of all.

504
01:21:59,325 --> 01:22:04,600
But those who know and are left-sided,

505
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:15,308
the combination of knowledge and love,
knowledge and compassion.

506
01:22:15,509 --> 01:22:19,542
If there is no love, if there is
no compassion,

507
01:22:19,742 --> 01:22:26,922
I mean you, just can’t talk to that
person. He’s like a stick!

508
01:22:27,122 --> 01:22:31,470
I mean, in a dried stick what vibrations
can I give, you just tell Me?

509
01:22:31,671 --> 01:22:36,825
A dried stick, straightforward dried stick,
you see.

510
01:22:37,230 --> 01:22:39,520
What vibrations I can give to a dried
stick?

511
01:22:39,720 --> 01:22:49,814
There should be some sort of a greenery
in it, isn’t it? Little bit at least.

512
01:22:50,015 --> 01:22:54,732
If it is too much of water also it is
spoiled, can be rotten.

513
01:22:54,932 --> 01:23:02,312
But if it is a dry stick straightforward,
you know what I mean, dry sticks are -

514
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:04,808
then how can you give vibrations
to such a person?

515
01:23:05,008 --> 01:23:07,208
You cannot. You cannot raise such a person.

516
01:23:07,409 --> 01:23:12,762
So, first thing is love, and wisdom
comes through love.

517
01:23:13,290 --> 01:23:19,169
Wisdom doesn’t come through intelligence,
it comes through love.

518
01:23:19,377 --> 01:23:25,866
When you love someone, you get the light
of wisdom.

519
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:28,827
By thinking you can never become wise,
you can become stupid,

520
01:23:29,028 --> 01:23:36,026
absolutely stupid, but by loving you can
become very wise.

521
01:23:36,227 --> 01:23:39,600
Then I see Sahaj Yogis suddenly they
say some things extremely wise,

522
01:23:39,801 --> 01:23:44,036
something great, suddenly say something
that’s so sweet

523
01:23:44,237 --> 01:23:48,210
and so nice, I said: “That’s it, the heart
has opened out”.

524
01:23:48,411 --> 01:23:51,187
The fragrance of wisdom comes from
the heart

525
01:23:51,387 --> 01:23:55,555
and that is symbolic now, that three
of them came,

526
01:23:55,755 --> 01:24:00,036
and they were who? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

527
01:24:03,285 --> 01:24:08,403
They came to see Christ – Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

528
01:24:12,509 --> 01:24:15,504
See the vibrations.

529
01:24:25,062 --> 01:24:28,965
Because They only can recognize,

530
01:24:32,051 --> 01:24:38,786
not ordinary people, Romans, no.

531
01:24:42,529 --> 01:24:45,442
So They came.

532
01:24:45,808 --> 01:24:50,676
So we have to be humble and we have
to be wise.

533
01:24:51,434 --> 01:24:57,645
Wisdom is such a, such a diamond,

534
01:24:57,846 --> 01:25:01,673
it has so many facets that I cannot
describe to you in a short time,

535
01:25:01,874 --> 01:25:04,989
one day I’ll talk about wisdom.

536
01:25:06,495 --> 01:25:11,472
But it’s all common sense, so sweet,
so beautiful,

537
01:25:11,672 --> 01:25:15,233
where to say what, how to change
the subject,

538
01:25:15,433 --> 01:25:23,448
where to assert more, where to handle
a situation in a strong way,

539
01:25:23,648 --> 01:25:32,403
is to, where to be a gentleman and where
to be uncouth,

540
01:25:33,475 --> 01:25:38,573
where to shout at people and where to be
quiet and humble and sweet.

541
01:25:38,774 --> 01:25:43,184
All such a judgment you see, is all
that is wisdom, you see.

542
01:25:43,574 --> 01:25:46,951
Is a center of gravity,

543
01:25:47,151 --> 01:25:50,510
and to achieve that you have to give up
your extreme behavior.

544
01:25:50,710 --> 01:25:57,856
Obstinacy is the first thing that should be
given up, for all wisdom, obstinacy.

545
01:26:06,377 --> 01:26:09,098
To have a son like Christ was such
a great boon

546
01:26:09,298 --> 01:26:16,491
I mean, so confident You know, feel,
“adhara”, the complete rapport is there,

547
01:26:16,692 --> 01:26:22,411
no problem of any kind, to have a son
like Him,

548
01:26:23,636 --> 01:26:28,794
completely obedient, absolutely 100%
obedience and humility

549
01:26:28,995 --> 01:26:33,945
and understanding of Your Being.

550
01:26:36,562 --> 01:26:39,692
No problems.

551
01:26:41,757 --> 01:26:45,951
You are all My sons too, and made
after Him,

552
01:26:46,152 --> 01:26:50,536
after the same pattern as I made Christ.

553
01:26:51,129 --> 01:26:55,872
I’m proud of you, you are My children,

554
01:26:56,484 --> 01:27:02,255
come up to it, and you have an example
already created for you.

555
01:27:04,436 --> 01:27:08,929
Before you is Christ, you see Him,
what a support it was,

556
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:12,232
I never had any complaints of any kind,
no upset,

557
01:27:12,432 --> 01:27:16,452
He would never be upset, no question!

558
01:27:16,652 --> 01:27:18,090
He would never tell Me, “I’m upset,” never,

559
01:27:18,291 --> 01:27:25,442
this word doesn’t exist in the dictionary
of wise.

560
01:27:29,484 --> 01:27:35,114
You are never - how can you be upset,
when you are set once for all?

561
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,187
This word must go from the dictionary
of many Sahaj Yogis who use it,

562
01:27:41,388 --> 01:27:44,619
problems and upset.

563
01:27:49,193 --> 01:27:52,963
You solve the problem, give the solutions.

564
01:27:53,164 --> 01:27:57,153
No problems, only solutions.

565
01:28:00,848 --> 01:28:04,364
That’s the way a son should be to a mother,

566
01:28:04,564 --> 01:28:10,341
that she can depend on him, absolutely,
no problems there, nothing,

567
01:28:10,541 --> 01:28:16,395
I mean, you have a son born like Christ,
what is there to worry about anything?

568
01:28:19,851 --> 01:28:28,965
Even the one word He said: “Behold
the Mother”, is a mantra,

569
01:28:29,166 --> 01:28:34,356
is the greatest mantra that I use.

570
01:28:35,164 --> 01:28:39,830
When your attention is here and there,
I just say that mantra to you,

571
01:28:40,030 --> 01:28:47,451
as a command it is! And so humble,
so confident: “Behold”.

572
01:28:47,651 --> 01:28:53,669
“Behold” doesn’t mean look, no, it’s a very
humble way of addressing,

573
01:28:53,869 --> 01:28:56,804
‘behold,’ it’s something glorious,
something great,

574
01:28:57,004 --> 01:29:01,343
behold it, accept it, understand.

575
01:29:01,543 --> 01:29:05,245
It was such a mutual understanding
of support and love

576
01:29:05,445 --> 01:29:08,559
that should exist between us.

577
01:29:09,276 --> 01:29:14,887
No secretiveness, no formalities,
no exclusiveness.

578
01:29:17,662 --> 01:29:20,460
No exclusiveness, all enjoyments must
be together.

579
01:29:20,661 --> 01:29:26,929
Now all your ideas of having separate
enjoyments

580
01:29:27,130 --> 01:29:30,846
must be given up for a change.

581
01:29:31,046 --> 01:29:38,852
Holiday is when you are in the company
of your, no more holidays, Sahaj Yogis.

582
01:29:39,053 --> 01:29:41,569
All these things must be given up.

583
01:29:41,769 --> 01:29:45,569
This is all against Christ’s behavior.

584
01:29:45,769 --> 01:29:50,122
He never had a holiday, never.

585
01:29:53,520 --> 01:29:56,692
This is holidaying.

586
01:30:00,162 --> 01:30:03,905
Holiday comes from the word holy day.

587
01:30:04,105 --> 01:30:08,214
Every day that is spent, every minute
that is spent

588
01:30:08,415 --> 01:30:13,569
in the company of Christ is a holy day.

589
01:30:16,425 --> 01:30:17,619
So they must have brought it down,

590
01:30:17,819 --> 01:30:26,866
Christ to Spirit and Spirit to spirits
and spirits to other things. I’m sure.

591
01:30:27,066 --> 01:30:34,493
I mean, that way, human beings are very
great at deriving at right points, you see,

592
01:30:34,693 --> 01:30:37,394
and jumping into ditches directly.

593
01:30:37,594 --> 01:30:42,018
So they must have done it so sweetly,
beautifully,

594
01:30:42,218 --> 01:30:51,401
that’s what it is wisdom, wisdom,
all the time, wisdom.

595
01:30:51,601 --> 01:30:58,374
Wise man is never cunning, never sharp.
Is something I cannot describe also.

596
01:30:58,574 --> 01:31:03,274
And who is the wisest of all is Shri
Ganesha, who is the embodiment of wisdom.

597
01:31:03,474 --> 01:31:06,211
Ask Him for wisdom.

598
01:31:06,412 --> 01:31:11,653
He gives you the wisdom to do anything,
ask Him for wisdom.

599
01:31:13,173 --> 01:31:17,638
Today I just think of how many Christmas
I must have passed,

600
01:31:17,839 --> 01:31:20,350
I’ve never talked about Christ so much,

601
01:31:20,551 --> 01:31:25,889
with that intimacy. Such a relationship,

602
01:31:26,090 --> 01:31:34,453
such a relationship of, so near and
so far - because He knew who I was.

603
01:31:36,148 --> 01:31:41,560
That awe, that respect, that humility,

604
01:31:41,760 --> 01:31:47,311
is hard to find in any disciple, even
in a disciple, in your own son!

605
01:31:47,512 --> 01:31:52,176
Is so close, but complete understanding.

606
01:31:55,715 --> 01:32:01,266
That oneness has to be developed.

607
01:32:01,466 --> 01:32:05,006
Gradually we are all developing it, I know,

608
01:32:05,206 --> 01:32:08,791
but these are the days of speed and
we have to speed up a little more

609
01:32:08,991 --> 01:32:11,942
in the right direction.

610
01:32:13,122 --> 01:32:19,643
So now, as desired by you, we have
a white Christmas outside.

611
01:32:19,844 --> 01:32:21,228
[Some yogis say: “Jai Shri Mataji”].

612
01:32:21,429 --> 01:32:29,403
Then as you have desired that “Wash me
and I shall be whiter than snow”

613
01:32:30,619 --> 01:32:33,598
is been blessed,

614
01:32:35,830 --> 01:32:40,455
think of all the nice things we have
done together

615
01:32:40,656 --> 01:32:45,374
and that we are going together to do it
later on:

616
01:32:45,575 --> 01:32:49,107
that’s how you solve your past and future
problem.

617
01:32:49,308 --> 01:32:55,551
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

618
01:32:55,785 --> 01:32:59,932
So Christ who is the present Christ,

619
01:33:00,817 --> 01:33:07,457
today, who is born in you, is to be
looked after.

620
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:13,312
He’s not the Christ of the Bible, but
the Christ of your heart,

621
01:33:13,513 --> 01:33:18,036
which is born within you is to be
looked after.

622
01:33:21,190 --> 01:33:26,949
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

623
01:33:27,150 --> 01:33:31,693
for people to understand it,
it’s too symbolic.

624
01:33:31,893 --> 01:33:40,122
But at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand.

625
01:33:41,357 --> 01:33:44,663
So one has to only understand through
your own Spirit,

626
01:33:44,864 --> 01:33:50,306
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

627
01:33:50,506 --> 01:33:55,723
Put Him in a very soft heart, if you
have thistles,

628
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:59,864
He’s a collective being.

629
01:34:00,064 --> 01:34:08,411
If you affect the collectivity,
then He’s affected. Look after Him.

630
01:34:12,971 --> 01:34:17,921
So they say Merry Christmas is enjoyment
for joy.

631
01:34:18,122 --> 01:34:23,301
Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy,
happiness.

632
01:34:23,501 --> 01:34:28,811
I wish peace for the whole world,
for the whole nations,

633
01:34:29,012 --> 01:34:33,250
to understand to give up all the strives,

634
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:40,028
all the false battles, for money and
for power,

635
01:34:40,805 --> 01:34:46,145
all wrong ideas that they are different
from each other,

636
01:34:46,346 --> 01:34:51,842
and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

637
01:34:52,042 --> 01:34:56,747
and enter into the Kingdom of God,

638
01:34:57,512 --> 01:35:02,494
where they are invited with all respect
and love.

639
01:35:02,694 --> 01:35:06,620
I wish peace to all of them, to all
the countries,

640
01:35:06,820 --> 01:35:15,958
all the human beings, in their families,
in their hearts, with their children.

641
01:35:17,912 --> 01:35:26,475
With all of them, let there be peace,
let their heart emit peace,

642
01:35:26,676 --> 01:35:36,403
their tongues speak with peace,
their eyes see nothing but peace.

643
01:35:40,523 --> 01:35:45,664
All this has to change, tremendous change
has to take place,

644
01:35:45,864 --> 01:35:49,468
the whole universe has to take
a different turn.

645
01:35:49,668 --> 01:35:55,138
All that is hatred, hateful, ugly,
has to vanish,

646
01:35:55,338 --> 01:35:59,483
and the peace has to prevail, which is
not the peace of the dead

647
01:35:59,684 --> 01:36:05,153
but peace of the living, that has to come,
of the wise.

648
01:36:05,874 --> 01:36:10,059
I bless all of you to be the channels
of that peace,

649
01:36:10,260 --> 01:36:16,584
to be beautiful channels of that peace,
to be glorious channels of that peace,

650
01:36:16,784 --> 01:36:23,369
to be great children of your Mother,
who is so proud of you.

651
01:36:23,570 --> 01:36:26,567
May God bless you.

652
01:37:48,682 --> 01:37:50,379
There’s a mantra for the Goddess:

653
01:37:50,579 --> 01:37:55,093
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita":

654
01:37:55,294 --> 01:38:01,936
Oh Goddess who resides through all
this creation created,

655
01:38:02,137 --> 01:38:06,635
all that is created, as peace.

656
01:38:07,478 --> 01:38:13,749
So you have to seek peace that is
your Mother.

657
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:22,255
We all say that mantra. Gavin, you say it:

658
01:38:22,456 --> 01:38:25,834
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

659
01:38:26,035 --> 01:38:28,877
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

660
01:38:29,058 --> 01:38:35,346
You say it once and then they should
say it thrice. It’s a prayer.

661
01:38:35,547 --> 01:38:42,006
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

662
01:38:42,207 --> 01:38:49,631
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

663
01:38:49,832 --> 01:38:56,680
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

664
01:38:56,881 --> 01:39:03,923
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

665
01:39:04,124 --> 01:39:10,527
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

666
01:39:10,743 --> 01:39:18,271
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

667
01:39:28,335 --> 01:39:33,971
And then another one is kshama rupena
samsthita, this is the mantra  because

668
01:39:34,172 --> 01:39:38,707
the peace can come only through
humility and forgiveness, “kshama”.

669
01:39:38,908 --> 01:39:44,532
That’s why Christ is kshama. You say
that for Christ.

670
01:39:44,812 --> 01:39:50,973
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

671
01:39:51,174 --> 01:39:57,426
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

672
01:39:57,627 --> 01:40:03,756
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

673
01:40:03,957 --> 01:40:09,564
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

674
01:40:09,765 --> 01:40:15,702
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

675
01:40:15,903 --> 01:40:23,022
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

676
01:40:31,149 --> 01:40:35,009
Despite that, Agnyas are catching.

677
01:40:38,390 --> 01:40:41,653
Now can you take out Agnya? Those
who are feeling hurt,

678
01:40:41,854 --> 01:40:45,934
please give up your Agnyas now,
can you put your finger

679
01:40:46,181 --> 01:40:52,570
here for Agnya? Here. Good for the Jews.

680
01:41:26,448 --> 01:41:29,611
Hmm. Better?

681
01:41:47,159 --> 01:41:50,736
So now all this is too much for Christmas,

682
01:41:50,937 --> 01:41:53,694
at the most you can wash My hands
and this and that,

683
01:41:53,895 --> 01:41:58,007
you can sing something and you can
have little puja, that’s all.

684
01:41:58,208 --> 01:42:00,089
For Me the puja is over, if you can get a…

685
01:42:00,290 --> 01:42:04,605
you could just wash My hands
[and that’s it? Not clearly audible].

686
01:42:14,379 --> 01:42:20,947
Now. All these presents are to be
opened near the tree or something,

687
01:42:21,148 --> 01:42:25,463
this is the tree, tree of life. Present.

688
01:42:25,664 --> 01:42:28,460
Is giver of everything, giver of all
the gifts,

689
01:42:28,661 --> 01:42:32,344
is this tree of life, is the Kundalini,

690
01:42:32,545 --> 01:42:35,998
so symbolic, you see? So symbolic.

691
01:42:36,199 --> 01:42:41,368
The egg of Easter, this tree of, I mean
it’s so symbolic.

692
01:42:41,569 --> 01:42:46,484
I wish your Kundalinis were as beautiful
as that tree.

693
01:42:50,700 --> 01:42:53,755
Giver of all the gifts.

694
01:42:55,129 --> 01:42:59,006
Is called as Kalpataru, in Sanskrit.

695
01:43:01,047 --> 01:43:05,343
Alright, so, we can do that washing…
Gavin: Just getting water.

696
01:43:05,544 --> 01:43:10,159
Shri Mataji: Of the hands.
Sahaja Yogi: He’s just bringing the water.

697
01:43:10,389 --> 01:43:13,652
Shri Mataji: Is there a towel, or…?

698
01:43:17,665 --> 01:43:20,310
Shri Mataji: … way, isn’t it?

699
01:43:20,516 --> 01:43:23,956
I mean, if you tell somebody “Don’t put
your fingers there”, they won’t listen.

700
01:43:24,157 --> 01:43:30,467
But once it is burnt, then they know,
wisdom comes in, through experience.

701
01:43:30,668 --> 01:43:35,226
But now [they don’t have?] innate.
[Unclear]

702
01:43:40,430 --> 01:43:44,176
[Aside to Gavin] Yes, just wash first
of all.

703
01:43:59,178 --> 01:44:03,725
Look at that. Hm. Ganges.

704
01:44:03,926 --> 01:44:07,625
River Thames has behaved so far,
so far.

705
01:44:07,826 --> 01:44:12,319
I hope so, she behaves even when
I go away.

706
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:17,112
Should we put it somewhere?
[Yogi: Put it in that…]

707
01:44:17,313 --> 01:44:23,402
She was very furious, you know?
Very furious she was.

708
01:44:24,794 --> 01:44:33,857
She is a standing danger. I must say.
For the sinful, be careful.

709
01:44:36,359 --> 01:44:40,739
All the polish of the house and everything
like that .

710
01:44:40,940 --> 01:44:45,554
Today I was polishing symbolically.

711
01:44:46,120 --> 01:44:51,971
Ah, now. First of all we’ll wash and then
we’ll do it, all right?

712
01:44:53,008 --> 01:44:59,471
All right. Bring it, the… no, I think
I’ll have now the ghee.

713
01:45:04,853 --> 01:45:08,212
Should take this quite a lot, keep it
with them

714
01:45:08,413 --> 01:45:13,748
and take it at least seven days,
as a medicine. This is very good.

715
01:45:13,949 --> 01:45:19,269
For all those who have Void problems,
specially for [voiders?].

716
01:45:25,316 --> 01:45:30,949
Linda, I’ll have time now, once this is
over then you can come and see Me,

717
01:45:31,150 --> 01:45:34,516
and then we’ll discuss about other things,
all right?

718
01:45:36,249 --> 01:45:40,514
Now, what should we do?
Gavin: He’s just getting ghee now.

719
01:45:40,873 --> 01:45:43,233
It’s been warmed.

720
01:45:49,837 --> 01:45:51,791
Shri Mataji: You don’t have anything
for Aarti and all that,

721
01:45:51,992 --> 01:45:55,015
I’ll bring this time when I go there.

722
01:45:56,508 --> 01:46:00,742
If I save some money. Yes.

723
01:46:01,592 --> 01:46:06,357
You know, the letter was not shown
to Modi.

724
01:46:11,120 --> 01:46:14,376
Letter you give up.

725
01:46:34,629 --> 01:46:38,058
This is ghee?
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

726
01:46:38,259 --> 01:46:43,242
Shri Mataji: This is ghee! So much! 
Out of proportion it is, I mean.

727
01:46:43,443 --> 01:46:46,888
It’s too much softening.

728
01:46:49,319 --> 01:46:54,085
All right, give Me little bit now, some.
Just a wee bit.

729
01:46:54,286 --> 01:46:59,290
As it is you all have liver, so you don’t
need ghee.

730
01:47:02,323 --> 01:47:04,644
It’s all right.

731
01:47:07,010 --> 01:47:09,904
Now pour some water.

732
01:47:14,722 --> 01:47:18,834
Good for cleaning the nose of all
the people who have sinus…

733
01:47:19,035 --> 01:47:23,463
the ghee, but not for eating, eh?

734
01:47:35,143 --> 01:47:38,827
Now. Little bit now of another thing,
whatever it is.

735
01:47:54,868 --> 01:47:57,719
Put the whole thing.

736
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:07,127
Again some water.

737
01:48:19,841 --> 01:48:22,032
Now.

738
01:48:25,594 --> 01:48:28,858
Milk has to be more. Madhu,
madhu,

739
01:48:29,059 --> 01:48:32,305
you get madhu first, madhu means…

740
01:48:32,720 --> 01:48:36,245
Milk will be more than this. Yes.

741
01:49:03,274 --> 01:49:06,443
Gavin: Shall I put milk next?

742
01:49:06,644 --> 01:49:10,559
Shri Mataji: Yes, milk, then. And more
milk than…

743
01:49:16,186 --> 01:49:20,404
Gavin: …sugar.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

744
01:49:31,618 --> 01:49:34,719
Milk. Need for more milk, I think.

745
01:49:54,470 --> 01:49:59,173
More. Here.

746
01:50:01,526 --> 01:50:04,534
Yes, it’s all right.

747
01:50:20,992 --> 01:50:23,994
Not too much sugar.

748
01:50:45,247 --> 01:50:49,115
Not to feel guilty, for Heaven’s sake.

749
01:50:51,172 --> 01:50:54,956
Not to feel guilty at all, left -
left Vishuddhi catching.

750
01:50:55,157 --> 01:50:58,510
Don’t think! In My presence you are
not supposed to think at all.

751
01:50:58,711 --> 01:51:03,593
Just don’t think. Don’t feel guilty.

752
01:51:04,920 --> 01:51:10,965
Catching, still.
[Aside] Good, thank you.

753
01:51:18,414 --> 01:51:22,193
Yogi: She’s posing! 
Shri Mataji: She’s posing!

754
01:51:32,520 --> 01:51:38,355
Look at her. Wrapped up in the sari.

755
01:51:39,444 --> 01:51:42,392
Fitting in great, herself [unclear].

756
01:51:43,306 --> 01:51:46,659
Gavin: Just matches her eyes.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

757
01:51:46,860 --> 01:51:52,226
Gavin: The sari just matches her eyes.
Shri Mataji: You see? Just see [indistinct].

758
01:51:55,260 --> 01:51:58,720
It’s a dignified thing, you know,
sari is very dignified.

759
01:51:58,921 --> 01:52:02,446
Now. All right.

760
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:27,209
Very nice people. Very sensible.

761
01:52:31,901 --> 01:52:36,091
Gavin, in your list you must put this also.

762
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:42,537
If you tell this list to Me, there,
who is coming gives you.

763
01:52:42,738 --> 01:52:46,336
Who are coming to India out of you?

764
01:52:49,948 --> 01:52:52,214
Here?

765
01:53:01,262 --> 01:53:06,354
Now, those who are coming should
get this list

766
01:53:06,555 --> 01:53:13,130
of a few things that you need,
essential ones.

767
01:53:13,331 --> 01:53:18,127
I don’t find that thing with which you used
to give Me water, is it here or not?

768
01:53:18,328 --> 01:53:20,624
With the spoon and all that.

769
01:53:20,825 --> 01:53:22,959
Gavin: I must check it with Marcus
afterwards. Shri Mataji: Marcus?

770
01:53:23,160 --> 01:53:25,668
Marcus: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You’ve got that spoon and…

771
01:53:25,869 --> 01:53:28,948
Marcus: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: That
you have got. Marcus: Yes.

772
01:53:30,094 --> 01:53:34,715
Shri Mataji: All right [speaks aside in a
low voice. Sounds like: there’s the spoon].

773
01:53:46,281 --> 01:53:51,019
This one is very good because it is not
hard wood.

774
01:55:50,938 --> 01:55:54,432
Yogi: Christmas… [indistinct].

775
01:56:18,906 --> 01:56:25,797
Shri Mataji: Now, just put some red
on my hand. Red [Kumkum? Unclear]

776
01:56:30,781 --> 01:56:35,633
Shri Mataji: I will. Gavin: Our Mother,
You are the Counsellor

777
01:56:35,834 --> 01:56:40,291
who was promised by Christ.
Shri Mataji: I am.

778
01:56:40,492 --> 01:56:44,646
Gavin: You make us become our
own knowledge.

779
01:56:47,647 --> 01:56:52,742
Our Mother, You are the Redeemer,
who was promised by Christ.

780
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:57,763
You have given us our second birth.

781
01:57:00,985 --> 01:57:08,352
Our Mother, You are the fulfillment
of every prophecy and every prayer.

782
01:57:10,720 --> 01:57:13,510
Our Mother, You are the wholesomeness,

783
01:57:13,711 --> 01:57:17,984
by which all wrongs are cleansed.

784
01:57:21,238 --> 01:57:25,426
Our Mother, You are the right
discrimination

785
01:57:25,627 --> 01:57:30,021
by which we have received enlightenment.

786
01:57:33,396 --> 01:57:36,585
Our Mother, You are the integration,

787
01:57:36,786 --> 01:57:42,049
by You God’s whole creation has been
threaded together.

788
01:57:47,558 --> 01:57:51,653
We bow to You who are auspiciousness;

789
01:57:56,527 --> 01:57:59,980
we praise You who are Love;

790
01:58:02,339 --> 01:58:06,873
we give thanks to You who are compassion;

791
01:58:08,993 --> 01:58:18,964
we prostrate before You who are all-knowing,
all-seeing and all-forgiving.

792
01:58:20,860 --> 01:58:23,699
We are Your children:

793
01:58:25,614 --> 01:58:29,175
let us never be separated from You,

794
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:35,014
whether by Your illusion, or by our
own limitations.

795
01:58:36,967 --> 01:58:40,424
Give us strength of Spirit

796
01:58:43,735 --> 01:58:50,146
and to the world give peace. Aum.

797
01:58:51,180 --> 01:58:53,644
Yogis: Amen.

798
01:59:20,778 --> 01:59:26,929
Shri Mataji: Let your life be fragrant
by My blessings,

799
01:59:30,693 --> 01:59:33,564
by My love,

800
01:59:36,532 --> 01:59:39,888
by My concern,

801
01:59:40,699 --> 01:59:44,605
and the pride that I have for you all.

802
02:00:11,387 --> 02:00:14,216
May God bless you.

803
02:00:20,343 --> 02:00:24,020
Yogini: … and it’s called “Mother God”.
Shri Mataji: Who?

804
02:00:24,221 --> 02:00:29,934
Yogini: It’s called “Mother God”. Shri
Mataji: “Mother God”. Yogini: “Mother God”.

805
02:03:33,590 --> 02:03:35,844
Shri Mataji: Oh.

806
02:03:55,572 --> 02:04:01,389
Sang [you?] with such a heart. Everybody
was, everybody’s heart was singing with you.

807
02:04:01,590 --> 02:04:05,994
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

808
02:04:12,626 --> 02:04:15,259
These songs should be recorded
and should be sent to India.

809
02:04:15,460 --> 02:04:19,890
They would be very happy, you see,
to have these songs.

810
02:04:28,865 --> 02:04:31,094
Very beautiful. Who wrote it?
Yogini: Hugo wrote it, Mother.

811
02:04:31,335 --> 02:04:34,343
Shri Mataji: Eh? Yogini: Hugo wrote it.
Shri Mataji: Hugo. Yogini: Hugo did that.

812
02:04:34,544 --> 02:04:38,432
Shri Mataji: Congratulations.
Give him a hand.

813
02:04:53,897 --> 02:04:56,659
Beautiful.

814
02:04:57,596 --> 02:04:59,886
Integration is so important, you see.

815
02:05:00,087 --> 02:05:02,705
Somebody has to write, somebody
has to compose,

816
02:05:02,906 --> 02:05:06,491
somebody has to sing and somebody
has to listen.
