00:00:20.333 --> 00:00:26.667
Shri Raja Rajeshwari Puja

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:35.250
December 6th, 1991, Madras, India

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.792
Today we’ll be having Shri Ganesha Puja,

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:47.375
followed by Raja Rajeshwari.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:56.083
So many names have been described of the Goddess:

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.834
specially Adi Shankaracharya called Her Raja

00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:04.999
Rajeshwari, meaning She’s the Queen of all the Queens.

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:20.208
Also for Mother Mary they have used this title in the West.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.750
These ideas have come from the pagan religion,

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:38.041
as I have told you before, and that they didn’t come by

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.375
the description of Mother Mary in the Bible.

00:01:45.917 --> 00:01:54.250
That shows that there has been lot of changes into the

00:01:54.917 --> 00:01:59.125
script of holy Bible.

00:01:59.834 --> 00:02:05.959
Also there has been lot of changes in the script of

00:02:06.458 --> 00:02:09.000
Indian scriptures, even Gita.

00:02:13.166 --> 00:02:20.166
And that’s how the derailment in every religion started.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:25.250
And the intellectuals took advantage of it

00:02:26.542 --> 00:02:30.291
and started projecting their own idea,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.208
saying things, describing things

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.542
which were absolutely against divine Power.

00:02:43.834 --> 00:02:48.917
You are all very fortunate people on this Earth

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.208
that you have discovered the reality,

00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:56.083
and you see that all these things

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:59.750
which were mythological are true;

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.208
all the things that are intellectual is not true;

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:14.250
also whatever are used for the purpose of dividing people

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.709
from each other are not true.

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:22.375
Because we believe in all the religions,

00:03:22.917 --> 00:03:27.166
that’s why every religious person, so-called,

00:03:27.667 --> 00:03:29.083
is against us;

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.333
because you are supposed to believe only in one religion

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.000
and fight all the rest.

00:03:34.583 --> 00:03:36.333
If you believe in all religions, that means you are

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.834
absolutely not religious – this is the concept.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.458
And that shocked them, that we believe in all the religions

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.166
and we respect all the incarnations, and that we believe in

00:03:49.417 --> 00:03:55.166
the integration of all these deities.

00:03:56.458 --> 00:04:01.333
Regarding Ganesha, it must have been a big revelation for

00:04:01.792 --> 00:04:04.625
you people who are from the Western countries.

00:04:04.917 --> 00:04:07.125
Even in the north I don’t find Ganesha is so much

00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:11.667
worshipped as worshipped in the south, specially in this

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:16.750
area, and also in Maharashtra; because in Maharashtra

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:20.208
we have eight swayambhu Ganeshas,

00:04:20.625 --> 00:04:22.667
and they all believe in it.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:27.375
It is now said that it is all blind faith, and this and that.

00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:32.542
But now you have seen Ganesha standing behind Me,

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:34.583
within Me:

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.417
it’s just to prove that there is a deity called Ganesha.

00:04:41.625 --> 00:04:44.417
You’ll be given those photographs where Ganesha is

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.083
halfway sitting here, and the rest is My sari and all that.

00:04:54.417 --> 00:04:58.792
But all this is to convince you

00:04:59.667 --> 00:05:05.625
that there is a deity which is Shri Ganesh,

00:05:05.792 --> 00:05:10.333
and that He acts, works through Mooladhara.

00:05:10.959 --> 00:05:15.208
This knowledge was known to Indian people

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:18.333
thousands of years back.

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:24.291
This kuchipudi dancing started seven centuries before Christ,

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:28.458
so you can imagine, the concept of Ganesha must

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.792
have been thousands of years back.

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:37.583
So the people were very much evolved spiritually in this

00:05:37.917 --> 00:05:42.083
country, and they knew what are the deities are, how they

00:05:42.458 --> 00:05:47.542
look like, what are their functions are – though it was a

00:05:47.834 --> 00:05:50.333
secret knowledge for the general public.

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:53.792
But whatever the saints said was accepted,

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:58.166
because there was no ego about it.

00:05:59.917 --> 00:06:02.000
I have been trying to locate why

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:05.709
in the West people develop so much of ego.

00:06:06.125 --> 00:06:10.041
Still I have not been able to find out the basic reason,

00:06:10.542 --> 00:06:17.792
why this kind of aggressiveness comes in through the ego part.

00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:22.959
One can say that competitiveness and all that, but this has

00:06:23.333 --> 00:06:30.125
been the history in the West that even the people who

00:06:30.458 --> 00:06:37.041
followed Christ, which was nothing but humility absolutely

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.375
absolutely writ large everywhere,

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:43.417
still those people were so aggressive.

00:06:43.875 --> 00:06:48.208
Now the humility is the main thing one has to understand.

00:06:48.834 --> 00:06:52.208
And you’ll be surprised, the humility is called as vinay,

00:06:52.583 --> 00:06:56.542
which is the quality of Shri Ganesha – Vinayaka.

00:06:56.917 --> 00:07:01.500
“Vidya vinayen shobhate.” “Vidya” means “The knowledge

00:07:01.834 --> 00:07:05.959
is only decorated with humility.”

00:07:06.583 --> 00:07:10.375
So the humility you saw yesterday of these great artists,

00:07:10.875 --> 00:07:13.417
and the great gurus who were there.

00:07:13.542 --> 00:07:16.250
And the guru invited Me to his academy,

00:07:16.917 --> 00:07:24.583
and he made all kinds of offerings as they would do

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:26.583
to a Goddess.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.250
I was so much touched, the ready acceptance

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:37.500
of Me and of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.000
Even this Kalakshetra, which was dominated by

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.834
Theosophical Society – though this lady

00:07:43.166 --> 00:07:46.250
didn’t bother so much about Theosophical Society –

00:07:46.667 --> 00:07:51.500
and she had created this big auditorium and all that,

00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:53.959
and everything she dedicated to art.

00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:58.583
She didn’t allow Theosophical Society enter into it.

00:08:00.375 --> 00:08:04.417
Despite all that, how they accepted Me, all of them,

00:08:04.667 --> 00:08:12.417
you can see so clearly their devotion and understanding.

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:18.291
To be humble with a saint is absolutely

00:08:18.709 --> 00:08:21.750
an unwritten law of this country.

00:08:22.458 --> 00:08:27.792
And a saint is not to be challenged, not to be dominated.

00:08:28.250 --> 00:08:32.125
Whatever the saint says must be accepted.

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:37.792
So the first quality that Ganesha should give us is vinay –

00:08:38.083 --> 00:08:41.250
“vinay” meaning the humility.

00:08:43.333 --> 00:08:47.667
The humility is not superficial, like you go on saying

00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:51.875
“sorry” or “excuse me”, “I’m afraid” -

00:08:52.125 --> 00:08:54.417
not that way. It’s not watchik,

00:08:54.959 --> 00:08:58.917
it’s not just lip-service, but from within

00:08:59.208 --> 00:09:02.500
the humility has to come.

00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:07.417
Now the humility is, of course, is always marred by ego

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:11.583
and the ego just keeps you afloat, and you never

00:09:11.917 --> 00:09:15.709
understand that you have been egoistical.

00:09:15.834 --> 00:09:18.000
Even when I talk about ego, people think that

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:20.500
Mother is saying about somebody else there,

00:09:20.834 --> 00:09:23.750
they never think “it’s me who has this ego.”

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:27.417
So Ganesha is the killer of ego,

00:09:27.875 --> 00:09:31.291
because humility is the only thing that really

00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:34.166
can neutralize your ego.

00:09:34.709 --> 00:09:38.959
To humble down yourself, you have to see what?

00:09:39.583 --> 00:09:41.999
For example in this country you have come, very simple

00:09:42.417 --> 00:09:46.542
people, you see, living very simply, they don’t have all

00:09:46.625 --> 00:09:52.250
these sophisticated things around them; eating

00:09:52.625 --> 00:09:56.333
with their hands, eating on the plant and leaves, you see.

00:09:56.875 --> 00:09:59.458
And according to certain ladies who have lived here,

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:05.750
the Westerners, they think they are all primitive.

00:10:06.999 --> 00:10:13.500
But see the way they have developed this art.

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:19.208
This kind of swiftness and this kind of, even jumping

00:10:19.999 --> 00:10:24.542
this kind, you cannot achieve.

00:10:25.458 --> 00:10:30.083
Now, what is the reason for this kind of working,

00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:34.041
is humility towards art.

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:37.333
Art is to be respected.

00:10:37.792 --> 00:10:39.417
A guru is to be respected.

00:10:39.917 --> 00:10:45.208
Respect is the only way to learning anything.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:49.500
That is sort of ingrained in an Indian blood, I think,

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:57.458
that you must obey your guru implicitly, implicitly.

00:10:57.999 --> 00:10:59.917
And this guru is training so many people,

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:02.583
there are so many girls there,

00:11:05.917 --> 00:11:11.458
not for anything but just to express his art.

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:14.166
He doesn’t get much money, I could see that.

00:11:14.208 --> 00:11:16.959
They have very little provision,

00:11:18.125 --> 00:11:21.125
and also he doesn’t charge too much.

00:11:22.166 --> 00:11:26.500
But the dedication he has is like

00:11:26.917 --> 00:11:30.667
the dedication of Shri Ganesha to His Mother.

00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:37.333
And the way he is completely drawn into it:

00:11:37.667 --> 00:11:41.417
all other things are not important.

00:11:43.083 --> 00:11:46.625
So for humility you have to withdraw your attention

00:11:46.959 --> 00:11:48.834
from other things.

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:53.166
This is an extremely important thing.

00:11:54.583 --> 00:11:59.458
If your attention is going to your other problems,

00:11:59.959 --> 00:12:03.417
this, that, or if you are trying to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:12:03.834 --> 00:12:10.667
through other channels, it’s not going to work out.

00:12:10.667 --> 00:12:15.667
You have to humble down in your heart,

00:12:16.125 --> 00:12:18.417
absolutely humble down.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.250
He's innocent, that’s why He’s humble.

00:12:24.709 --> 00:12:29.041
If you are not innocent, then you cannot be humble.

00:12:29.959 --> 00:12:36.583
Sign of innocence is humility.

00:12:37.083 --> 00:12:42.625
A good child, a nice innocent child is extremely obedient.

00:12:43.458 --> 00:12:47.291
Whatever you tell them, they just obey.

00:12:47.792 --> 00:12:52.000
I know My grandchildren – once we were going to Nepal,

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:54.583
and it was very cold there.

00:12:54.959 --> 00:12:56.083
And their mother said,

00:12:56.458 --> 00:12:58.125
“They won’t take anything on their heads.”

00:12:58.375 --> 00:13:00.709
I said, “I’ll do it in one, one minute.”

00:13:00.999 --> 00:13:03.999
I just called them, gave them pieces of ordinary cloth.

00:13:03.999 --> 00:13:06.959
I said, “You have to cover your head”. “All right.”

00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:08.375
They put it on their head,

00:13:08.667 --> 00:13:09.999
put it properly, fixed it up.

00:13:10.208 --> 00:13:14.458
They were looking a little weird, but they didn’t mind.

00:13:16.542 --> 00:13:18.959
This is what

00:13:20.917 --> 00:13:23.834
is missing,

00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:28.875
and that’s why we find the depth is less.

00:13:33.375 --> 00:13:35.291
Not just only the conditionings –

00:13:35.709 --> 00:13:37.542
I would not say the conditioning.

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:40.375
People are out of conditioning;

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:43.999
even Indians have become like that.

00:13:44.999 --> 00:13:51.750
It’s difficult for them to be humble, very difficult.

00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:54.250
You may call Western influence, or maybe that they have

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.041
forgotten their past.

00:13:57.542 --> 00:13:59.750
But humility is so important.

00:14:00.208 --> 00:14:02.875
Like I must tell you, from our childhood, though I was born

00:14:03.083 --> 00:14:06.583
in a Christian family, we had to touch the Mother Earth

00:14:06.917 --> 00:14:09.417
and ask for forgiveness first,

00:14:09.625 --> 00:14:12.542
so you put it to your head.

00:14:12.875 --> 00:14:15.291
And touch the feet of your parents,

00:14:15.542 --> 00:14:18.875
and all the elders of the family – isn’t it so?

00:14:19.166 --> 00:14:23.291
Touch everybody’s feet who are elder in the family.

00:14:23.583 --> 00:14:26.291
Even some old servants, you see, who had looked after our

00:14:26.583 --> 00:14:31.458
elder brothers and all that – touch their feet also.

00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:35.750
But that humility is lacking.

00:14:36.291 --> 00:14:41.417
And that dignity that elders should have is also not there.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:46.792
But whatever it is, it was our duty to touch everybody’s feet,

00:14:47.291 --> 00:14:51.250
and not to discuss the elders.

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:57.041
So this will create such a beautiful atmosphere in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:03.250
if you insist that “Am I humble in doing this?”

00:15:03.709 --> 00:15:05.000
Just ask a question,

00:15:05.375 --> 00:15:10.166
“Have I been humble in doing this, or in saying this?”

00:15:10.583 --> 00:15:16.542
Now the problems are criticizing the leaders.

00:15:18.625 --> 00:15:22.875
They are leaders because they deserve it.

00:15:23.458 --> 00:15:25.834
The day I find they are no good, I’ll throw them out –

00:15:26.125 --> 00:15:28.458
also you know that very well.

00:15:28.959 --> 00:15:31.000
But there is no humility.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.250
Then the humility is replaced by ego, and that ego creates

00:15:38.667 --> 00:15:41.500
an ego in the leaders.

00:15:41.834 --> 00:15:44.917
The leaders become egoistical, and so many leaders

00:15:44.917 --> 00:15:46.083
are thrown out.

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.125
I mean I just don’t know, when the balance has to come,

00:15:49.583 --> 00:15:55.417
whether I should blame the members or the leaders.

00:15:55.875 --> 00:15:58.583
So Mother has appointed them as leaders,

00:15:58.959 --> 00:16:00.959
so let us be humble.

00:16:01.375 --> 00:16:04.542
After all, there must be some reason why Mother has asked

00:16:04.959 --> 00:16:07.083
them to be the leaders.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:10.000
Why should we try to quarrel with them, find faults?

00:16:10.291 --> 00:16:15.625
Like a union we form.

00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:22.959
So Shri Ganesha, who is so humble, and His ganas

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:26.458
are even more humble in a way,

00:16:26.458 --> 00:16:28.500
because He won’t tolerate any gana

00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:32.458
who is not humble to Mother.

00:16:32.875 --> 00:16:38.417
With a little movement of the eyes they are there to fight,

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:41.875
and to do whatever it is they are suggested.

00:16:42.125 --> 00:16:46.000
And they understand every angle of the eye of their Mother,

00:16:46.333 --> 00:16:48.667
what is to be done.

00:16:48.750 --> 00:16:50.999
So this kind of dedication only

00:16:51.458 --> 00:16:54.792
can make you deeper and deeper.

00:16:55.417 --> 00:17:00.999
Now may be that the way we know about that in the West,

00:17:01.375 --> 00:17:05.500
we have to spread out more, we have to advertise more,

00:17:05.917 --> 00:17:08.041
we have to talk about ourselves more,

00:17:08.333 --> 00:17:10.959
we have to boast about ourselves more.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.959
The more you do it, the more successful you’ll be.

00:17:15.375 --> 00:17:17.250
That’s what you see it every day.

00:17:17.333 --> 00:17:19.166
They boast “I believe” – you see,

00:17:19.458 --> 00:17:22.166
who are you to believe or not to believe?

00:17:22.417 --> 00:17:24.208
Who are you to say this?

00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:27.083
But sort of, see your image has to go like that –

00:17:27.208 --> 00:17:36.375
a man of great personality, or some sort of a big profile.

00:17:36.917 --> 00:17:42.375
You create a profile; absolutely artificial, nonsensical.

00:17:43.083 --> 00:17:46.125
And very surprising, to such a profile which is so

00:17:46.417 --> 00:17:51.375
artificial, people bow.

00:17:51.875 --> 00:17:56.792
Maybe they are also artificial, that’s why they bow to

00:17:57.083 --> 00:17:58.999
these artificial people.

00:17:59.333 --> 00:18:02.417
I’m surprised. I mean, these are well-known crooks,

00:18:02.667 --> 00:18:05.834
so people know they are crooks, they have done all kinds,

00:18:06.083 --> 00:18:09.709
but still they will prostrate before them.

00:18:09.999 --> 00:18:13.000
Because maybe that they want some sort of a material

00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:16.542
advantage out of it, or I don’t know,

00:18:16.792 --> 00:18:20.208
some sort of an artificial advantage.

00:18:20.458 --> 00:18:22.750
Even a taking a photograph with such a man is regarded

00:18:22.959 --> 00:18:26.750
as something very great.

00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:37.792
So all these ideas must be seen through by Sahaja yogis.

00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:41.333
They have to see through this joke, this drama, what’s

00:18:41.583 --> 00:18:46.083
going on, and also reflect it back and introspect and see,

00:18:46.333 --> 00:18:50.083
“I hope I don’t have this in me.”

00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:55.917
Sometimes we laugh at others but we ourselves are in it.

00:18:56.250 --> 00:19:00.542
So once we start introspecting, we see within ourselves,

00:19:01.125 --> 00:19:05.917
“Yes, this is there.”

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:10.291
There are certain Sahaja yogis in certain countries,

00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:13.959
I’m always being reported as, suddenly they say,

00:19:14.125 --> 00:19:17.959
“Mother has given me special powers.” Or they say,

00:19:18.166 --> 00:19:20.500
“I am Maha Mataji” – also there was one like that,

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:25.250
Maha Mataji.

00:19:27.166 --> 00:19:30.542
I’ve never said I am Mataji even.

00:19:30.917 --> 00:19:33.250
You people call Me that, I’ve never said that.

00:19:33.667 --> 00:19:36.792
But he said, “I am Maha Mataji.”

00:19:37.041 --> 00:19:39.542
You can call him mad, you can call him anything,

00:19:39.834 --> 00:19:44.125
but it is definitely his arrogance

00:19:45.125 --> 00:19:49.041
has prospered in such a way that

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:52.500
he doesn’t see what he’s talking about.

00:19:56.834 --> 00:20:02.625
This is how also you pamper the ego of your leaders,

00:20:02.999 --> 00:20:05.542
by attacking him.

00:20:05.917 --> 00:20:08.709
The more you attack him, he reacts and when he reacts,

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:12.667
his ego goes on pumping like that.

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:22.834
As I told you, today we are going to do

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:25.208
the worship of Raja Rajeshwari.

00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:28.291
I have never said this to you before.

00:20:28.792 --> 00:20:30.417
I’ve never asked you to read Guru Gita,

00:20:30.959 --> 00:20:32.291
for the same reason.

00:20:32.667 --> 00:20:35.917
I’ve never told you that She is Raja Rajeshwari,

00:20:36.709 --> 00:20:41.000
because again that might little bit go into your ego,

00:20:41.375 --> 00:20:44.000
“How can She be the Queen of all the Queens?”

00:20:44.041 --> 00:20:45.792
Of course, Christ’s Mother is all right,

00:20:46.166 --> 00:20:49.208
but not Mataji – it’s too much!

00:20:51.125 --> 00:20:53.667
So I never told you this.

00:20:54.125 --> 00:20:56.166
I said, “Baba, I’m a humble Mother, that’s all,

00:20:56.875 --> 00:20:59.999
Holy Mother” – finished.

00:21:00.375 --> 00:21:04.792
Creates holes here, that’s why it may, may be!

00:21:05.125 --> 00:21:12.041
Whatever it is, I could understand what was the problem,

00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.583
and in a very humorous way we have managed many things.

00:21:15.959 --> 00:21:21.417
But still I feel that, see the way these artists are,

00:21:21.667 --> 00:21:25.959
the way these people are, the way they are creating things –

00:21:26.458 --> 00:21:30.792
may not be according to your ideas about decorativeness,

00:21:31.083 --> 00:21:32.041
or all that.

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:35.125
You might say it’s rather loud, or maybe this, that,

00:21:35.417 --> 00:21:39.333
as it is, you see, always in the brain.

00:21:39.667 --> 00:21:41.667
“It could have been much less, there should be some

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000
spaced-out thing,” and all that.

00:21:45.291 --> 00:21:49.250
You might start criticizing, because that‘s one of

00:21:49.542 --> 00:21:52.875
the qualities of people who are not humble,

00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:56.583
that they think they have a capacity to criticize anything.

00:21:56.959 --> 00:21:59.792
“Oh, I don’t like this color, it’s no good.”

00:22:00.125 --> 00:22:07.250
But the artist has made it with his heart – appreciate it!

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.959
So the second point is to appreciate.

00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:18.250
Appreciate your life; whatever it is, appreciate,

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:21.208
accept it.

00:22:21.959 --> 00:22:23.999
But not with reluctance.

00:22:24.375 --> 00:22:28.458
All these mental ideas in the head that art means this

00:22:28.834 --> 00:22:32.917
and art means that, has led us to this situation that

00:22:33.291 --> 00:22:36.291
we are not going to have any more Rembrandts nor

00:22:36.667 --> 00:22:39.583
Michelangelo – finished.

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:42.750
It’s not mental, art is never mental.

00:22:43.041 --> 00:22:45.625
It’s coming from inside, and whatever is coming from

00:22:45.999 --> 00:22:53.458
inside cannot be compared with outside our ideas.

00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:58.333
So the appreciation part – I mean, you can say South

00:22:58.709 --> 00:23:03.625
Indians wear very, very loud dresses in our own style.

00:23:03.834 --> 00:23:07.999
But to Me they do not.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:12.917
Some might say something else.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:16.792
Also I’ve noticed the North Indians must criticize

00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:19.834
the South Indians, the South Indians must criticize

00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:22.166
the North Indians.

00:23:22.500 --> 00:23:26.291
But whatever it is, what is – nobody’s getting

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.083
good out of anyone. It’s stupidity, it is stupidity.

00:23:31.375 --> 00:23:34.208
But to appreciate

00:23:36.333 --> 00:23:41.709
and to accept, you imbibe that.

00:23:42.083 --> 00:23:47.625
North Indians cannot like South Indian food, whatever it is.

00:23:48.083 --> 00:23:49.875
Whatever you may try, they cannot.

00:23:50.208 --> 00:23:51.792
They cannot like their music also.

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.208
Now, can you imagine the whole of India divided

00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.875
into two parts,

00:23:57.291 --> 00:24:00.083
and the South Indians cannot like North Indian food nor

00:24:00.417 --> 00:24:02.458
the North Indian dancing –

00:24:02.792 --> 00:24:05.166
I mean, even in our country.

00:24:07.041 --> 00:24:10.917
We’re so divisible, is this country is, that a person

00:24:11.333 --> 00:24:15.000
from Rameshwaram won’t like food from Madras,

00:24:15.333 --> 00:24:19.166
a person from Madras won’t like the food from Delhi.

00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:26.000
So these divisive methods have come through

00:24:26.834 --> 00:24:30.834
the innate humility not being you.

00:24:31.583 --> 00:24:34.667
If you can enjoy each and everything,

00:24:35.125 --> 00:24:37.917
then you are humble.

00:24:39.709 --> 00:24:44.834
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

00:24:45.417 --> 00:24:50.750
then you are humble.

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:57.542
This humility is a very deep-down character,

00:24:57.959 --> 00:25:01.875
because from Mooladhara it comes.

00:25:05.041 --> 00:25:08.166
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

00:25:08.709 --> 00:25:12.667
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

00:25:12.959 --> 00:25:19.417
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:22.875
He just moves, with all His big stomach

00:25:23.083 --> 00:25:26.875
He moves on a little rat.

00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:35.583
No assertion of His powers – He’s so humble,

00:25:36.041 --> 00:25:39.375
He’s so sweet.

00:25:40.083 --> 00:25:42.709
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and

00:25:42.959 --> 00:25:44.999
things and vibrations.

00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:50.959
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

00:25:51.667 --> 00:25:57.834
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

00:25:58.542 --> 00:26:00.041
instead of denouncing this, that.

00:26:00.792 --> 00:26:04.417
I mean, like even the color of this room you may not like,

00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:05.625
this you may not like.

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.375
I mean, there are so many things you don’t like.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:11.875
Then I have to ask, “What do you like?”

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:15.750
“Baked beans” – all right!

00:26:24.333 --> 00:26:26.333
We have to open out ourselves.

00:26:26.667 --> 00:26:31.417
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

00:26:31.917 --> 00:26:35.250
Without humility you cannot, because you are objecting

00:26:35.458 --> 00:26:39.458
to everything, creating a wall.

00:26:39.999 --> 00:26:45.166
Only the humility will make you spread out.

00:26:45.875 --> 00:26:49.375
Today, the first day of our tour,

00:26:50.542 --> 00:26:58.208
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

00:26:58.625 --> 00:27:04.291
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

00:27:04.792 --> 00:27:07.166
and is beautiful.

00:27:07.625 --> 00:27:10.750
You saw that little girl playing veena, such a difficult

00:27:11.041 --> 00:27:16.000
Adi Vadyam, primordial instrument, playing with such

00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:19.625
sweetness, with such deftness, and so humble.

00:27:20.125 --> 00:27:21.500
And she came to Me and she said,

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.792
“Mother, what a privilege it was that I got

00:27:25.083 --> 00:27:28.959
the opportunity to play before You.”

00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:33.959
Just imagine – such a genius.

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:37.750
Another one who met Me last time was a mandolin player

00:27:38.125 --> 00:27:41.000
about the same age, maybe younger.

00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.792
I mean, he is now world-renowned, but when he played

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.709
before Me, wouldn’t accept any money, nothing,

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.750
he just went into ecstasy.

00:27:50.083 --> 00:27:53.542
Even the dancer, she told Me she went into ecstasy

00:27:53.625 --> 00:27:54.875
when she saw Me,

00:27:55.375 --> 00:27:57.709
and she just danced so well with such vigor.

00:27:58.041 --> 00:28:00.333
And she – she had temperature.

00:28:00.542 --> 00:28:01.959
She said, “My temperature is gone, everything,

00:28:01.959 --> 00:28:05.542
I am perfectly all right.”

00:28:06.291 --> 00:28:09.458
Look at those artists. I mean, they have never known Me,

00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:11.792
they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:16.041
But what a humble understanding of Divinity –

00:28:16.291 --> 00:28:20.500
because they are humble.

00:28:20.875 --> 00:28:23.834
Divinity never asserts itself, doesn’t propagate itself,

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:27.083
doesn’t make a big sound.

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.041
So now they are here. Come along.

00:28:30.333 --> 00:28:32.917
Is that Guido?

00:28:33.875 --> 00:28:35.917
Italians have come.

00:28:38.375 --> 00:28:42.750
That’s why I delayed the puja today.

00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:50.375
Is that Guido? Just call him.

00:28:55.542 --> 00:28:59.458
Guido is too humble to come forward.

00:29:11.375 --> 00:29:15.667
Come in, come in.

00:29:18.333 --> 00:29:27.208
Just move forward a little bit.

00:29:36.458 --> 00:29:40.125
May God bless you.

00:29:41.750 --> 00:29:44.959
I’ve been waiting for you!

00:29:50.917 --> 00:29:55.333
Please, please be seated.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.500
No, no, come! Come along.

00:30:10.875 --> 00:30:13.750
Can you – you can all sit in front, there is space.

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:17.125
Just come …. you can all sit there.

00:30:17.417 --> 00:30:18.583
I have to keep them pleased, you see,

00:30:18.917 --> 00:30:23.542
because I am living in Italy!

00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:26.333
Just come on ….

00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:35.667
It’s all right, so they might get a part of it.

00:30:35.999 --> 00:30:37.583
Just come in front, there.

00:30:37.834 --> 00:30:40.667
Or you can sit in the middle, doesn’t matter.

00:30:40.959 --> 00:30:46.000
You can sit there wherever you are, yes, you can.

00:30:52.583 --> 00:30:57.999
Come forward, come forward, there’s space here.

00:31:10.041 --> 00:31:12.750
So I was telling them about Shri Ganesha,

00:31:12.999 --> 00:31:17.667
that His essential power comes through His humility;

00:31:17.917 --> 00:31:22.083
and that we all have to be extremely humble,

00:31:22.458 --> 00:31:26.542
extremely humble, appreciating everything.

00:31:26.875 --> 00:31:30.083
Of course, you must make them hear My lecture –

00:31:30.375 --> 00:31:32.500
they have already taped it – so they will know

00:31:32.875 --> 00:31:35.041
what I am saying today.

00:31:35.291 --> 00:31:37.083
But now we can have the puja.

00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:42.792
May God bless you.
