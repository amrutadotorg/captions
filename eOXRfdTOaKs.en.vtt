WEBVTT

00:20.333 --> 00:26.667
Shri Raja Rajeshwari Puja

00:28.667 --> 00:35.250
December 6th, 1991, Madras, India

00:38.750 --> 00:41.792
Today we’ll be having Shri Ganesha Puja,

00:42.542 --> 00:47.375
followed by Raja Rajeshwari.

00:49.125 --> 00:56.083
So many names have been described of the Goddess:

00:57.750 --> 00:59.834
specially Adi Shankaracharya called Her Raja

01:00.041 --> 01:04.999
Rajeshwari, meaning She’s the Queen of all the Queens.

01:05.667 --> 01:20.208
Also for Mother Mary they have used this title in the West.

01:24.500 --> 01:29.750
These ideas have come from the pagan religion,

01:30.208 --> 01:38.041
as I have told you before, and that they didn’t come by

01:40.000 --> 01:45.375
the description of Mother Mary in the Bible.

01:45.917 --> 01:54.250
That shows that there has been lot of changes into the

01:54.917 --> 01:59.125
script of holy Bible.

01:59.834 --> 02:05.959
Also there has been lot of changes in the script of

02:06.458 --> 02:09.000
Indian scriptures, even Gita.

02:13.166 --> 02:20.166
And that’s how the derailment in every religion started.

02:21.375 --> 02:25.250
And the intellectuals took advantage of it

02:26.542 --> 02:30.291
and started projecting their own idea,

02:33.000 --> 02:37.208
saying things, describing things

02:37.959 --> 02:42.542
which were absolutely against divine Power.

02:43.834 --> 02:48.917
You are all very fortunate people on this Earth

02:49.500 --> 02:52.208
that you have discovered the reality,

02:52.291 --> 02:56.083
and you see that all these things

02:56.458 --> 02:59.750
which were mythological are true;

03:00.250 --> 03:04.208
all the things that are intellectual is not true;

03:04.709 --> 03:14.250
also whatever are used for the purpose of dividing people

03:14.750 --> 03:18.709
from each other are not true.

03:18.999 --> 03:22.375
Because we believe in all the religions,

03:22.917 --> 03:27.166
that’s why every religious person, so-called,

03:27.667 --> 03:29.083
is against us;

03:29.709 --> 03:31.333
because you are supposed to believe only in one religion

03:31.709 --> 03:34.000
and fight all the rest.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.333
If you believe in all religions, that means you are

03:37.000 --> 03:41.834
absolutely not religious – this is the concept.

03:42.250 --> 03:44.458
And that shocked them, that we believe in all the religions

03:44.959 --> 03:49.166
and we respect all the incarnations, and that we believe in

03:49.417 --> 03:55.166
the integration of all these deities.

03:56.458 --> 04:01.333
Regarding Ganesha, it must have been a big revelation for

04:01.792 --> 04:04.625
you people who are from the Western countries.

04:04.917 --> 04:07.125
Even in the north I don’t find Ganesha is so much

04:07.458 --> 04:11.667
worshipped as worshipped in the south, specially in this

04:12.083 --> 04:16.750
area, and also in Maharashtra; because in Maharashtra

04:17.166 --> 04:20.208
we have eight swayambhu Ganeshas,

04:20.625 --> 04:22.667
and they all believe in it.

04:23.834 --> 04:27.375
It is now said that it is all blind faith, and this and that.

04:28.291 --> 04:32.542
But now you have seen Ganesha standing behind Me,

04:32.959 --> 04:34.583
within Me:

04:35.000 --> 04:40.417
it’s just to prove that there is a deity called Ganesha.

04:41.625 --> 04:44.417
You’ll be given those photographs where Ganesha is

04:44.750 --> 04:50.083
halfway sitting here, and the rest is My sari and all that.

04:54.417 --> 04:58.792
But all this is to convince you

04:59.667 --> 05:05.625
that there is a deity which is Shri Ganesh,

05:05.792 --> 05:10.333
and that He acts, works through Mooladhara.

05:10.959 --> 05:15.208
This knowledge was known to Indian people

05:15.667 --> 05:18.333
thousands of years back.

05:18.333 --> 05:24.291
This kuchipudi dancing started seven centuries before Christ,

05:24.792 --> 05:28.458
so you can imagine, the concept of Ganesha must

05:29.000 --> 05:32.792
have been thousands of years back.

05:33.999 --> 05:37.583
So the people were very much evolved spiritually in this

05:37.917 --> 05:42.083
country, and they knew what are the deities are, how they

05:42.458 --> 05:47.542
look like, what are their functions are – though it was a

05:47.834 --> 05:50.333
secret knowledge for the general public.

05:50.375 --> 05:53.792
But whatever the saints said was accepted,

05:54.291 --> 05:58.166
because there was no ego about it.

05:59.917 --> 06:02.000
I have been trying to locate why

06:02.500 --> 06:05.709
in the West people develop so much of ego.

06:06.125 --> 06:10.041
Still I have not been able to find out the basic reason,

06:10.542 --> 06:17.792
why this kind of aggressiveness comes in through the ego part.

06:18.417 --> 06:22.959
One can say that competitiveness and all that, but this has

06:23.333 --> 06:30.125
been the history in the West that even the people who

06:30.458 --> 06:37.041
followed Christ, which was nothing but humility absolutely

06:37.500 --> 06:39.375
absolutely writ large everywhere,

06:39.999 --> 06:43.417
still those people were so aggressive.

06:43.875 --> 06:48.208
Now the humility is the main thing one has to understand.

06:48.834 --> 06:52.208
And you’ll be surprised, the humility is called as vinay,

06:52.583 --> 06:56.542
which is the quality of Shri Ganesha – Vinayaka.

06:56.917 --> 07:01.500
“Vidya vinayen shobhate.” “Vidya” means “The knowledge

07:01.834 --> 07:05.959
is only decorated with humility.”

07:06.583 --> 07:10.375
So the humility you saw yesterday of these great artists,

07:10.875 --> 07:13.417
and the great gurus who were there.

07:13.542 --> 07:16.250
And the guru invited Me to his academy,

07:16.917 --> 07:24.583
and he made all kinds of offerings as they would do

07:24.959 --> 07:26.583
to a Goddess.

07:27.000 --> 07:32.250
I was so much touched, the ready acceptance

07:33.500 --> 07:37.500
of Me and of Sahaja Yoga.

07:37.500 --> 07:40.000
Even this Kalakshetra, which was dominated by

07:40.500 --> 07:42.834
Theosophical Society – though this lady

07:43.166 --> 07:46.250
didn’t bother so much about Theosophical Society –

07:46.667 --> 07:51.500
and she had created this big auditorium and all that,

07:51.999 --> 07:53.959
and everything she dedicated to art.

07:54.291 --> 07:58.583
She didn’t allow Theosophical Society enter into it.

08:00.375 --> 08:04.417
Despite all that, how they accepted Me, all of them,

08:04.667 --> 08:12.417
you can see so clearly their devotion and understanding.

08:13.500 --> 08:18.291
To be humble with a saint is absolutely

08:18.709 --> 08:21.750
an unwritten law of this country.

08:22.458 --> 08:27.792
And a saint is not to be challenged, not to be dominated.

08:28.250 --> 08:32.125
Whatever the saint says must be accepted.

08:32.625 --> 08:37.792
So the first quality that Ganesha should give us is vinay –

08:38.083 --> 08:41.250
“vinay” meaning the humility.

08:43.333 --> 08:47.667
The humility is not superficial, like you go on saying

08:48.041 --> 08:51.875
“sorry” or “excuse me”, “I’m afraid” -

08:52.125 --> 08:54.417
not that way. It’s not watchik,

08:54.959 --> 08:58.917
it’s not just lip-service, but from within

08:59.208 --> 09:02.500
the humility has to come.

09:03.166 --> 09:07.417
Now the humility is, of course, is always marred by ego

09:07.959 --> 09:11.583
and the ego just keeps you afloat, and you never

09:11.917 --> 09:15.709
understand that you have been egoistical.

09:15.834 --> 09:18.000
Even when I talk about ego, people think that

09:18.333 --> 09:20.500
Mother is saying about somebody else there,

09:20.834 --> 09:23.750
they never think “it’s me who has this ego.”

09:24.500 --> 09:27.417
So Ganesha is the killer of ego,

09:27.875 --> 09:31.291
because humility is the only thing that really

09:31.709 --> 09:34.166
can neutralize your ego.

09:34.709 --> 09:38.959
To humble down yourself, you have to see what?

09:39.583 --> 09:41.999
For example in this country you have come, very simple

09:42.417 --> 09:46.542
people, you see, living very simply, they don’t have all

09:46.625 --> 09:52.250
these sophisticated things around them; eating

09:52.625 --> 09:56.333
with their hands, eating on the plant and leaves, you see.

09:56.875 --> 09:59.458
And according to certain ladies who have lived here,

10:00.000 --> 10:05.750
the Westerners, they think they are all primitive.

10:06.999 --> 10:13.500
But see the way they have developed this art.

10:15.500 --> 10:19.208
This kind of swiftness and this kind of, even jumping

10:19.999 --> 10:24.542
this kind, you cannot achieve.

10:25.458 --> 10:30.083
Now, what is the reason for this kind of working,

10:30.208 --> 10:34.041
is humility towards art.

10:34.667 --> 10:37.333
Art is to be respected.

10:37.792 --> 10:39.417
A guru is to be respected.

10:39.917 --> 10:45.208
Respect is the only way to learning anything.

10:45.750 --> 10:49.500
That is sort of ingrained in an Indian blood, I think,

10:49.917 --> 10:57.458
that you must obey your guru implicitly, implicitly.

10:57.999 --> 10:59.917
And this guru is training so many people,

10:59.959 --> 11:02.583
there are so many girls there,

11:05.917 --> 11:11.458
not for anything but just to express his art.

11:11.999 --> 11:14.166
He doesn’t get much money, I could see that.

11:14.208 --> 11:16.959
They have very little provision,

11:18.125 --> 11:21.125
and also he doesn’t charge too much.

11:22.166 --> 11:26.500
But the dedication he has is like

11:26.917 --> 11:30.667
the dedication of Shri Ganesha to His Mother.

11:31.500 --> 11:37.333
And the way he is completely drawn into it:

11:37.667 --> 11:41.417
all other things are not important.

11:43.083 --> 11:46.625
So for humility you have to withdraw your attention

11:46.959 --> 11:48.834
from other things.

11:49.333 --> 11:53.166
This is an extremely important thing.

11:54.583 --> 11:59.458
If your attention is going to your other problems,

11:59.959 --> 12:03.417
this, that, or if you are trying to come to Sahaja Yoga

12:03.834 --> 12:10.667
through other channels, it’s not going to work out.

12:10.667 --> 12:15.667
You have to humble down in your heart,

12:16.125 --> 12:18.417
absolutely humble down.

12:19.000 --> 12:24.250
He's innocent, that’s why He’s humble.

12:24.709 --> 12:29.041
If you are not innocent, then you cannot be humble.

12:29.959 --> 12:36.583
Sign of innocence is humility.

12:37.083 --> 12:42.625
A good child, a nice innocent child is extremely obedient.

12:43.458 --> 12:47.291
Whatever you tell them, they just obey.

12:47.792 --> 12:52.000
I know My grandchildren – once we were going to Nepal,

12:52.333 --> 12:54.583
and it was very cold there.

12:54.959 --> 12:56.083
And their mother said,

12:56.458 --> 12:58.125
“They won’t take anything on their heads.”

12:58.375 --> 13:00.709
I said, “I’ll do it in one, one minute.”

13:00.999 --> 13:03.999
I just called them, gave them pieces of ordinary cloth.

13:03.999 --> 13:06.959
I said, “You have to cover your head”. “All right.”

13:07.166 --> 13:08.375
They put it on their head,

13:08.667 --> 13:09.999
put it properly, fixed it up.

13:10.208 --> 13:14.458
They were looking a little weird, but they didn’t mind.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.959
This is what

13:20.917 --> 13:23.834
is missing,

13:24.291 --> 13:28.875
and that’s why we find the depth is less.

13:33.375 --> 13:35.291
Not just only the conditionings –

13:35.709 --> 13:37.542
I would not say the conditioning.

13:37.875 --> 13:40.375
People are out of conditioning;

13:40.750 --> 13:43.999
even Indians have become like that.

13:44.999 --> 13:51.750
It’s difficult for them to be humble, very difficult.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.250
You may call Western influence, or maybe that they have

13:54.500 --> 13:57.041
forgotten their past.

13:57.542 --> 13:59.750
But humility is so important.

14:00.208 --> 14:02.875
Like I must tell you, from our childhood, though I was born

14:03.083 --> 14:06.583
in a Christian family, we had to touch the Mother Earth

14:06.917 --> 14:09.417
and ask for forgiveness first,

14:09.625 --> 14:12.542
so you put it to your head.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.291
And touch the feet of your parents,

14:15.542 --> 14:18.875
and all the elders of the family – isn’t it so?

14:19.166 --> 14:23.291
Touch everybody’s feet who are elder in the family.

14:23.583 --> 14:26.291
Even some old servants, you see, who had looked after our

14:26.583 --> 14:31.458
elder brothers and all that – touch their feet also.

14:32.041 --> 14:35.750
But that humility is lacking.

14:36.291 --> 14:41.417
And that dignity that elders should have is also not there.

14:41.750 --> 14:46.792
But whatever it is, it was our duty to touch everybody’s feet,

14:47.291 --> 14:51.250
and not to discuss the elders.

14:53.333 --> 14:57.041
So this will create such a beautiful atmosphere in Sahaja Yoga

14:57.375 --> 15:03.250
if you insist that “Am I humble in doing this?”

15:03.709 --> 15:05.000
Just ask a question,

15:05.375 --> 15:10.166
“Have I been humble in doing this, or in saying this?”

15:10.583 --> 15:16.542
Now the problems are criticizing the leaders.

15:18.625 --> 15:22.875
They are leaders because they deserve it.

15:23.458 --> 15:25.834
The day I find they are no good, I’ll throw them out –

15:26.125 --> 15:28.458
also you know that very well.

15:28.959 --> 15:31.000
But there is no humility.

15:32.000 --> 15:38.250
Then the humility is replaced by ego, and that ego creates

15:38.667 --> 15:41.500
an ego in the leaders.

15:41.834 --> 15:44.917
The leaders become egoistical, and so many leaders

15:44.917 --> 15:46.083
are thrown out.

15:46.500 --> 15:49.125
I mean I just don’t know, when the balance has to come,

15:49.583 --> 15:55.417
whether I should blame the members or the leaders.

15:55.875 --> 15:58.583
So Mother has appointed them as leaders,

15:58.959 --> 16:00.959
so let us be humble.

16:01.375 --> 16:04.542
After all, there must be some reason why Mother has asked

16:04.959 --> 16:07.083
them to be the leaders.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.000
Why should we try to quarrel with them, find faults?

16:10.291 --> 16:15.625
Like a union we form.

16:18.542 --> 16:22.959
So Shri Ganesha, who is so humble, and His ganas

16:23.417 --> 16:26.458
are even more humble in a way,

16:26.458 --> 16:28.500
because He won’t tolerate any gana

16:29.417 --> 16:32.458
who is not humble to Mother.

16:32.875 --> 16:38.417
With a little movement of the eyes they are there to fight,

16:38.750 --> 16:41.875
and to do whatever it is they are suggested.

16:42.125 --> 16:46.000
And they understand every angle of the eye of their Mother,

16:46.333 --> 16:48.667
what is to be done.

16:48.750 --> 16:50.999
So this kind of dedication only

16:51.458 --> 16:54.792
can make you deeper and deeper.

16:55.417 --> 17:00.999
Now may be that the way we know about that in the West,

17:01.375 --> 17:05.500
we have to spread out more, we have to advertise more,

17:05.917 --> 17:08.041
we have to talk about ourselves more,

17:08.333 --> 17:10.959
we have to boast about ourselves more.

17:11.250 --> 17:14.959
The more you do it, the more successful you’ll be.

17:15.375 --> 17:17.250
That’s what you see it every day.

17:17.333 --> 17:19.166
They boast “I believe” – you see,

17:19.458 --> 17:22.166
who are you to believe or not to believe?

17:22.417 --> 17:24.208
Who are you to say this?

17:24.583 --> 17:27.083
But sort of, see your image has to go like that –

17:27.208 --> 17:36.375
a man of great personality, or some sort of a big profile.

17:36.917 --> 17:42.375
You create a profile; absolutely artificial, nonsensical.

17:43.083 --> 17:46.125
And very surprising, to such a profile which is so

17:46.417 --> 17:51.375
artificial, people bow.

17:51.875 --> 17:56.792
Maybe they are also artificial, that’s why they bow to

17:57.083 --> 17:58.999
these artificial people.

17:59.333 --> 18:02.417
I’m surprised. I mean, these are well-known crooks,

18:02.667 --> 18:05.834
so people know they are crooks, they have done all kinds,

18:06.083 --> 18:09.709
but still they will prostrate before them.

18:09.999 --> 18:13.000
Because maybe that they want some sort of a material

18:13.250 --> 18:16.542
advantage out of it, or I don’t know,

18:16.792 --> 18:20.208
some sort of an artificial advantage.

18:20.458 --> 18:22.750
Even a taking a photograph with such a man is regarded

18:22.959 --> 18:26.750
as something very great.

18:28.500 --> 18:37.792
So all these ideas must be seen through by Sahaja yogis.

18:38.458 --> 18:41.333
They have to see through this joke, this drama, what’s

18:41.583 --> 18:46.083
going on, and also reflect it back and introspect and see,

18:46.333 --> 18:50.083
“I hope I don’t have this in me.”

18:50.458 --> 18:55.917
Sometimes we laugh at others but we ourselves are in it.

18:56.250 --> 19:00.542
So once we start introspecting, we see within ourselves,

19:01.125 --> 19:05.917
“Yes, this is there.”

19:06.250 --> 19:10.291
There are certain Sahaja yogis in certain countries,

19:10.583 --> 19:13.959
I’m always being reported as, suddenly they say,

19:14.125 --> 19:17.959
“Mother has given me special powers.” Or they say,

19:18.166 --> 19:20.500
“I am Maha Mataji” – also there was one like that,

19:20.500 --> 19:25.250
Maha Mataji.

19:27.166 --> 19:30.542
I’ve never said I am Mataji even.

19:30.917 --> 19:33.250
You people call Me that, I’ve never said that.

19:33.667 --> 19:36.792
But he said, “I am Maha Mataji.”

19:37.041 --> 19:39.542
You can call him mad, you can call him anything,

19:39.834 --> 19:44.125
but it is definitely his arrogance

19:45.125 --> 19:49.041
has prospered in such a way that

19:49.375 --> 19:52.500
he doesn’t see what he’s talking about.

19:56.834 --> 20:02.625
This is how also you pamper the ego of your leaders,

20:02.999 --> 20:05.542
by attacking him.

20:05.917 --> 20:08.709
The more you attack him, he reacts and when he reacts,

20:09.041 --> 20:12.667
his ego goes on pumping like that.

20:17.500 --> 20:22.834
As I told you, today we are going to do

20:23.250 --> 20:25.208
the worship of Raja Rajeshwari.

20:25.834 --> 20:28.291
I have never said this to you before.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.417
I’ve never asked you to read Guru Gita,

20:30.959 --> 20:32.291
for the same reason.

20:32.667 --> 20:35.917
I’ve never told you that She is Raja Rajeshwari,

20:36.709 --> 20:41.000
because again that might little bit go into your ego,

20:41.375 --> 20:44.000
“How can She be the Queen of all the Queens?”

20:44.041 --> 20:45.792
Of course, Christ’s Mother is all right,

20:46.166 --> 20:49.208
but not Mataji – it’s too much!

20:51.125 --> 20:53.667
So I never told you this.

20:54.125 --> 20:56.166
I said, “Baba, I’m a humble Mother, that’s all,

20:56.875 --> 20:59.999
Holy Mother” – finished.

21:00.375 --> 21:04.792
Creates holes here, that’s why it may, may be!

21:05.125 --> 21:12.041
Whatever it is, I could understand what was the problem,

21:12.500 --> 21:15.583
and in a very humorous way we have managed many things.

21:15.959 --> 21:21.417
But still I feel that, see the way these artists are,

21:21.667 --> 21:25.959
the way these people are, the way they are creating things –

21:26.458 --> 21:30.792
may not be according to your ideas about decorativeness,

21:31.083 --> 21:32.041
or all that.

21:32.458 --> 21:35.125
You might say it’s rather loud, or maybe this, that,

21:35.417 --> 21:39.333
as it is, you see, always in the brain.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.667
“It could have been much less, there should be some

21:42.000 --> 21:45.000
spaced-out thing,” and all that.

21:45.291 --> 21:49.250
You might start criticizing, because that‘s one of

21:49.542 --> 21:52.875
the qualities of people who are not humble,

21:53.041 --> 21:56.583
that they think they have a capacity to criticize anything.

21:56.959 --> 21:59.792
“Oh, I don’t like this color, it’s no good.”

22:00.125 --> 22:07.250
But the artist has made it with his heart – appreciate it!

22:09.250 --> 22:12.959
So the second point is to appreciate.

22:13.250 --> 22:18.250
Appreciate your life; whatever it is, appreciate,

22:18.667 --> 22:21.208
accept it.

22:21.959 --> 22:23.999
But not with reluctance.

22:24.375 --> 22:28.458
All these mental ideas in the head that art means this

22:28.834 --> 22:32.917
and art means that, has led us to this situation that

22:33.291 --> 22:36.291
we are not going to have any more Rembrandts nor

22:36.667 --> 22:39.583
Michelangelo – finished.

22:39.999 --> 22:42.750
It’s not mental, art is never mental.

22:43.041 --> 22:45.625
It’s coming from inside, and whatever is coming from

22:45.999 --> 22:53.458
inside cannot be compared with outside our ideas.

22:54.166 --> 22:58.333
So the appreciation part – I mean, you can say South

22:58.709 --> 23:03.625
Indians wear very, very loud dresses in our own style.

23:03.834 --> 23:07.999
But to Me they do not.

23:10.250 --> 23:12.917
Some might say something else.

23:13.250 --> 23:16.792
Also I’ve noticed the North Indians must criticize

23:17.083 --> 23:19.834
the South Indians, the South Indians must criticize

23:20.166 --> 23:22.166
the North Indians.

23:22.500 --> 23:26.291
But whatever it is, what is – nobody’s getting

23:26.500 --> 23:31.083
good out of anyone. It’s stupidity, it is stupidity.

23:31.375 --> 23:34.208
But to appreciate

23:36.333 --> 23:41.709
and to accept, you imbibe that.

23:42.083 --> 23:47.625
North Indians cannot like South Indian food, whatever it is.

23:48.083 --> 23:49.875
Whatever you may try, they cannot.

23:50.208 --> 23:51.792
They cannot like their music also.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.208
Now, can you imagine the whole of India divided

23:55.500 --> 23:56.875
into two parts,

23:57.291 --> 24:00.083
and the South Indians cannot like North Indian food nor

24:00.417 --> 24:02.458
the North Indian dancing –

24:02.792 --> 24:05.166
I mean, even in our country.

24:07.041 --> 24:10.917
We’re so divisible, is this country is, that a person

24:11.333 --> 24:15.000
from Rameshwaram won’t like food from Madras,

24:15.333 --> 24:19.166
a person from Madras won’t like the food from Delhi.

24:20.750 --> 24:26.000
So these divisive methods have come through

24:26.834 --> 24:30.834
the innate humility not being you.

24:31.583 --> 24:34.667
If you can enjoy each and everything,

24:35.125 --> 24:37.917
then you are humble.

24:39.709 --> 24:44.834
If you can appreciate each and every expression,

24:45.417 --> 24:50.750
then you are humble.

24:53.000 --> 24:57.542
This humility is a very deep-down character,

24:57.959 --> 25:01.875
because from Mooladhara it comes.

25:05.041 --> 25:08.166
And that is what is Shri Ganesha.

25:08.709 --> 25:12.667
Just imagine, He has a little rat on which He moves about,

25:12.959 --> 25:19.417
He doesn’t have Impala cars or Rolls Royces.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.875
He just moves, with all His big stomach

25:23.083 --> 25:26.875
He moves on a little rat.

25:27.500 --> 25:35.583
No assertion of His powers – He’s so humble,

25:36.041 --> 25:39.375
He’s so sweet.

25:40.083 --> 25:42.709
And He’s the creator of all the rhythms and

25:42.959 --> 25:44.999
things and vibrations.

25:45.375 --> 25:50.959
Without Him, I don’t know what would be this world.

25:51.667 --> 25:57.834
And that’s what we have to really appreciate everywhere,

25:58.542 --> 26:00.041
instead of denouncing this, that.

26:00.792 --> 26:04.417
I mean, like even the color of this room you may not like,

26:04.834 --> 26:05.625
this you may not like.

26:06.000 --> 26:07.375
I mean, there are so many things you don’t like.

26:07.750 --> 26:11.875
Then I have to ask, “What do you like?”

26:12.250 --> 26:15.750
“Baked beans” – all right!

26:24.333 --> 26:26.333
We have to open out ourselves.

26:26.667 --> 26:31.417
With humility you open out, you penetrate, you spread.

26:31.917 --> 26:35.250
Without humility you cannot, because you are objecting

26:35.458 --> 26:39.458
to everything, creating a wall.

26:39.999 --> 26:45.166
Only the humility will make you spread out.

26:45.875 --> 26:49.375
Today, the first day of our tour,

26:50.542 --> 26:58.208
I would request you that you have to be very, very humble.

26:58.625 --> 27:04.291
Understand that humility is extremely simple,

27:04.792 --> 27:07.166
and is beautiful.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.750
You saw that little girl playing veena, such a difficult

27:11.041 --> 27:16.000
Adi Vadyam, primordial instrument, playing with such

27:16.250 --> 27:19.625
sweetness, with such deftness, and so humble.

27:20.125 --> 27:21.500
And she came to Me and she said,

27:21.750 --> 27:24.792
“Mother, what a privilege it was that I got

27:25.083 --> 27:28.959
the opportunity to play before You.”

27:29.500 --> 27:33.959
Just imagine – such a genius.

27:34.250 --> 27:37.750
Another one who met Me last time was a mandolin player

27:38.125 --> 27:41.000
about the same age, maybe younger.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.792
I mean, he is now world-renowned, but when he played

27:45.000 --> 27:47.709
before Me, wouldn’t accept any money, nothing,

27:48.041 --> 27:49.750
he just went into ecstasy.

27:50.083 --> 27:53.542
Even the dancer, she told Me she went into ecstasy

27:53.625 --> 27:54.875
when she saw Me,

27:55.375 --> 27:57.709
and she just danced so well with such vigor.

27:58.041 --> 28:00.333
And she – she had temperature.

28:00.542 --> 28:01.959
She said, “My temperature is gone, everything,

28:01.959 --> 28:05.542
I am perfectly all right.”

28:06.291 --> 28:09.458
Look at those artists. I mean, they have never known Me,

28:09.750 --> 28:11.792
they don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

28:12.208 --> 28:16.041
But what a humble understanding of Divinity –

28:16.291 --> 28:20.500
because they are humble.

28:20.875 --> 28:23.834
Divinity never asserts itself, doesn’t propagate itself,

28:24.250 --> 28:27.083
doesn’t make a big sound.

28:27.500 --> 28:30.041
So now they are here. Come along.

28:30.333 --> 28:32.917
Is that Guido?

28:33.875 --> 28:35.917
Italians have come.

28:38.375 --> 28:42.750
That’s why I delayed the puja today.

28:47.500 --> 28:50.375
Is that Guido? Just call him.

28:55.542 --> 28:59.458
Guido is too humble to come forward.

29:11.375 --> 29:15.667
Come in, come in.

29:18.333 --> 29:27.208
Just move forward a little bit.

29:36.458 --> 29:40.125
May God bless you.

29:41.750 --> 29:44.959
I’ve been waiting for you!

29:50.917 --> 29:55.333
Please, please be seated.

30:09.000 --> 30:10.500
No, no, come! Come along.

30:10.875 --> 30:13.750
Can you – you can all sit in front, there is space.

30:14.125 --> 30:17.125
Just come …. you can all sit there.

30:17.417 --> 30:18.583
I have to keep them pleased, you see,

30:18.917 --> 30:23.542
because I am living in Italy!

30:23.834 --> 30:26.333
Just come on ….

30:32.500 --> 30:35.667
It’s all right, so they might get a part of it.

30:35.999 --> 30:37.583
Just come in front, there.

30:37.834 --> 30:40.667
Or you can sit in the middle, doesn’t matter.

30:40.959 --> 30:46.000
You can sit there wherever you are, yes, you can.

30:52.583 --> 30:57.999
Come forward, come forward, there’s space here.

31:10.041 --> 31:12.750
So I was telling them about Shri Ganesha,

31:12.999 --> 31:17.667
that His essential power comes through His humility;

31:17.917 --> 31:22.083
and that we all have to be extremely humble,

31:22.458 --> 31:26.542
extremely humble, appreciating everything.

31:26.875 --> 31:30.083
Of course, you must make them hear My lecture –

31:30.375 --> 31:32.500
they have already taped it – so they will know

31:32.875 --> 31:35.041
what I am saying today.

31:35.291 --> 31:37.083
But now we can have the puja.

31:37.583 --> 31:42.792
May God bless you.
