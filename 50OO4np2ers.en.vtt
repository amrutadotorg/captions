00:02:50.369 --> 00:02:59.694
It is such a great pleasure to see you all
assembled here,

00:02:59.895 --> 00:03:10.762
and which is such a far-fetched place, away
from the madding crowd.

00:03:11.526 --> 00:03:19.404
It's such a beautiful place, and which has
vibrations.

00:03:21.548 --> 00:03:25.281
They can't hear you.

00:03:26.493 --> 00:03:32.422
Now can you hear Me? All right.

00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:37.874
It's all right now.

00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:44.621
I selected this place suddenly

00:03:44.822 --> 00:03:51.469
from a very thick newspaper, American
newspaper.

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:55.571
The vibrations were just shooting out

00:03:55.771 --> 00:03:59.299
and I said, "What is this, coming from
where?"

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.737
And there was a little advertisement,

00:04:02.938 --> 00:04:08.289
and I said, "This is the place where we
have to go."

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:16.038
This place has so many vibrations, even
in the advertisement."

00:04:16.482 --> 00:04:22.834
So you can imagine how the guidance comes.

00:04:23.034 --> 00:04:30.682
It comes from vibrations, and that's how
I was here

00:04:30.882 --> 00:04:38.428
and this place was selected by the divine
Force,

00:04:38.628 --> 00:04:42.555
and it happened only in one day.

00:04:42.755 --> 00:04:47.441
Such a miraculous thing to happen in one
day!

00:04:48.545 --> 00:04:54.707
It was taking so much time for them even
to get this,

00:04:54.924 --> 00:04:59.861
and suddenly I told them, "Better get it."

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:10.327
It all worked out, and we are now here
in the most beautiful atmosphere.

00:05:13.469 --> 00:05:20.400
Of course, you know that Red Indians were
driven out

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:29.189
and they came here to hide themselves. They
were hiding themselves in this place

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:38.802
so that they should not be crushed and
destroyed forever.

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:46.634
That era is over now, that era
of domination,

00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:52.917
of entering into somebody else's land and
occupying it,

00:05:53.117 --> 00:05:57.272
and considering it to be a great revelry,

00:05:57.473 --> 00:06:04.017
all that is over now, the human
understanding has gone much beyond;

00:06:04.217 --> 00:06:11.078
and they understand that this is sinful,
this is wrong,

00:06:11.278 --> 00:06:14.643
whatever we have done was wrong.

00:06:14.843 --> 00:06:18.003
But those people are no more.

00:06:18.203 --> 00:06:23.689
And the children and the grandchildren
of those children

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:29.037
of these people who were the children
of God, they used to think,

00:06:29.238 --> 00:06:32.686
do not like all that;

00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:39.795
because you have no right

00:06:39.995 --> 00:06:47.981
to take somebody's land like that and
occupy it as your own.

00:06:48.693 --> 00:06:52.255
Of course, the land doesn't belong
to anyone,

00:06:52.456 --> 00:06:58.903
but still wherever you are born, that's
your land,

00:06:59.103 --> 00:07:08.052
and that land has to be kept with those
who are born here, who own it.

00:07:08.252 --> 00:07:14.852
But this kind of aggression has been going
on for ages now.

00:07:15.052 --> 00:07:19.633
Now the time has come to finish this,

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:24.783
once for all give up this kind
of adventure,

00:07:24.991 --> 00:07:33.306
is to enter into somebody's land or
somebody's house and occupy it.

00:07:33.507 --> 00:07:37.077
But there's another kind of aggression
I see now,

00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:42.627
is that they enter into the minds
of the people now

00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:52.333
through their talk, through their all kinds
of aggressive attitude,

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:57.704
and the mind, mind itself becomes a slave.

00:07:57.904 --> 00:08:06.166
The present times are like that, I think,
where people have no freedom

00:08:06.367 --> 00:08:14.083
to think what is right, what is wrong, and
also to take to right things.

00:08:14.284 --> 00:08:20.555
They have to accept whatever is happening
around,

00:08:21.079 --> 00:08:27.701
whatever is immoral, whatever is
destructive.

00:08:27.902 --> 00:08:34.421
One has to accept because still, I think,

00:08:34.622 --> 00:08:38.622
we do not have sufficient number of Sahaja
yogis

00:08:38.822 --> 00:08:48.558
who can oppose all these adventures
of modern times.

00:08:48.758 --> 00:08:52.722
We have another kind where we find

00:08:52.922 --> 00:09:01.124
these false gurus who aggress - specially
America.

00:09:01.783 --> 00:09:08.310
America is really cursed that way because
it had money,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:13.689
so all the crooks of the world came here -
just imagine.

00:09:13.889 --> 00:09:17.347
To have money itself is not a blessing.

00:09:17.547 --> 00:09:23.167
They all came here and looted rich people

00:09:23.443 --> 00:09:27.939
and have made so much money for themself.

00:09:30.244 --> 00:09:34.317
This kind of exploitation

00:09:34.518 --> 00:09:40.274
is very much dangerous, much more,

00:09:40.475 --> 00:09:46.016
because the mind gets ruined. I have seen
many people were ruined,

00:09:46.217 --> 00:09:52.166
specially many seekers were ruined
completely.

00:09:53.862 --> 00:10:00.203
I hope they are born again and get their
Self-realization.

00:10:00.403 --> 00:10:03.458
The seeking is there, no doubt,

00:10:03.658 --> 00:10:10.148
but all kinds of obstacles have come,
all kinds of temptations are there.

00:10:10.349 --> 00:10:20.729
And so, despite all that seeking, earnest
seeking, honest seeking,

00:10:20.929 --> 00:10:27.169
they have fallen into traps, which I cannot
explain

00:10:27.370 --> 00:10:33.218
why should it have happened, but it has
happened - one has to see.

00:10:33.419 --> 00:10:40.303
It's a - makes you very miserable, unhappy.

00:10:41.331 --> 00:10:47.074
But still so many are there, you are there,
saved now.

00:10:47.274 --> 00:10:54.186
And in this Last Judgment you have risen
from that level

00:10:54.387 --> 00:10:58.580
to this new level, where I am sure

00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:04.342
you will be able to salvage many more.

00:11:04.543 --> 00:11:11.040
Each person can salvage at least thousand
people, and so many of you,

00:11:11.241 --> 00:11:17.982
if you try that, it would be of a very,
very great,

00:11:18.182 --> 00:11:27.028
very great emancipation for this world
which we are all to save.

00:11:27.229 --> 00:11:36.777
So one must know the first, first duty
of every Sahaja yogi now

00:11:36.978 --> 00:11:42.874
is to save others, to talk about Sahaja
Yoga,

00:11:43.075 --> 00:11:51.092
to work out Sahaja Yoga in different
places.

00:11:51.293 --> 00:11:55.669
For example now, I was surprised that they
are working out

00:11:55.869 --> 00:12:03.746
on children who are abused. They are also
in India, we are working out

00:12:03.947 --> 00:12:09.601
on various places like prisons, armies.

00:12:09.802 --> 00:12:14.456
So you can enter into all kinds
of activities,

00:12:14.656 --> 00:12:26.107
you can enter into all kinds of aggressed
places and save people.

00:12:26.308 --> 00:12:32.615
But worst of all, I think, is the innocence
is under attack

00:12:32.815 --> 00:12:36.244
in these Western countries, specially
in America.

00:12:36.445 --> 00:12:44.219
The innocence is under attack and this is
something is very dangerous,

00:12:44.419 --> 00:12:54.158
because the children get this mutation
at a very young age,

00:12:54.359 --> 00:12:57.601
and what will happen to them?

00:12:57.792 --> 00:13:04.447
So we have to think of all those innocent
children,

00:13:04.647 --> 00:13:10.710
what we can do for them, how we can save
them,

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.823
how we can work it out.

00:13:14.024 --> 00:13:19.491
The concern has to now go from yourself
to others.

00:13:19.691 --> 00:13:24.825
You got your realization alright; you
corrected yourself,

00:13:25.025 --> 00:13:32.096
you are absolutely perfecting yourself;
all this is there,

00:13:32.296 --> 00:13:37.036
but now what is to be done?

00:13:37.237 --> 00:13:44.583
For what is this light enlightened here?
It is for others.

00:13:44.783 --> 00:13:51.242
So now Sahaja yogis have to live for others,
and not for themselves.

00:13:51.442 --> 00:13:55.278
They'll have all the energy, they'll have
all the support

00:13:55.455 --> 00:14:00.453
and they'll have all the blessings. So we
have to live for others.

00:14:00.654 --> 00:14:05.444
And how do we live for others - is very
simple,

00:14:05.644 --> 00:14:10.842
is to have concern, concern about
everything.

00:14:11.043 --> 00:14:17.259
You have concern about the Mother
Earth, concern about your neighbors,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:24.688
concern about the people who's suffering
all over the world.

00:14:24.888 --> 00:14:30.751
If you read the newspaper you will be
amazed how

00:14:30.951 --> 00:14:36.513
things are happening, how people are
suffering.

00:14:36.714 --> 00:14:39.675
We have to understand fundamentally

00:14:39.875 --> 00:14:43.984
that unless and until transformation takes
place,

00:14:44.184 --> 00:14:49.708
we cannot change this world. And you all
can transform others,

00:14:49.908 --> 00:14:55.496
so it's your duty, it's your job
to transform other people

00:14:55.697 --> 00:15:01.243
and tell them what is divine love.

00:15:01.443 --> 00:15:05.764
Love is the only way now we can work out.

00:15:05.965 --> 00:15:14.588
It is something like a big, big hole which
should go into this darkness of aggression,

00:15:14.789 --> 00:15:22.527
and which will clarify many places, many
hearts, many people.

00:15:22.727 --> 00:15:33.626
It is a ocean, we should say, ocean
of greatness.

00:15:33.826 --> 00:15:39.610
This divine love is so great

00:15:39.810 --> 00:15:48.001
and so powerful, at the same time so very
gentle

00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:53.704
that you can see the nature, how, how
the trees grow:

00:15:53.904 --> 00:16:03.142
every leaf gets the sunshine, every tree
has its own position.

00:16:03.342 --> 00:16:06.564
We have to learn so much from the nature,

00:16:06.765 --> 00:16:12.653
because nature is bound with that love.

00:16:13.066 --> 00:16:18.505
Nature has no aggressiveness.

00:16:18.705 --> 00:16:26.057
It is just under the complete control
of the divine love.

00:16:26.258 --> 00:16:31.861
With this understanding you should also
know

00:16:32.062 --> 00:16:38.132
that when you are getting to Sahaja yogis

00:16:38.332 --> 00:16:43.996
what should be your attitude: how you
should move,

00:16:44.197 --> 00:16:49.610
how you should talk to them, how you should
understand them,

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:53.190
how you should express your love.

00:16:53.390 --> 00:17:01.167
This is quite possible now, it's not
difficult.

00:17:01.368 --> 00:17:06.155
You should not be afraid, not feel shy.

00:17:06.355 --> 00:17:15.046
But in a sweet manner you can talk to them,

00:17:15.247 --> 00:17:21.182
you can communicate with them, you can
tell them;

00:17:21.773 --> 00:17:30.043
because this was the time, this was
to happen,

00:17:30.244 --> 00:17:33.921
that's the reason Adi Shakti had to come.

00:17:34.122 --> 00:17:38.247
Without Her, it would not have been
possible.

00:17:38.448 --> 00:17:42.914
All other incarnations were there,

00:17:43.114 --> 00:17:47.553
but firstly, they were only on one chakras,

00:17:47.753 --> 00:17:51.497
and another one was they had to establish
themselves

00:17:51.697 --> 00:17:56.095
with other people, with the people around.

00:17:56.295 --> 00:17:59.464
They did try and they worked it out,

00:17:59.664 --> 00:18:05.618
but it didn't really work in the real sense
of the word.

00:18:05.819 --> 00:18:13.404
So Adi Shakti had to come, who has all
of them with Her.

00:18:13.604 --> 00:18:20.480
They're all with us, all the time wanting
to help you

00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:29.500
to do everything that you want to achieve.
It is there with -

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:38.713
these holy vibrations are with you

00:18:38.913 --> 00:18:43.557
for every kind of good work you want to do,

00:18:43.758 --> 00:18:47.764
any kind of Sahaj work you want to do,

00:18:47.965 --> 00:18:53.926
these vibrations will definitely be there
to guide you,

00:18:54.127 --> 00:19:02.139
to help you, to support you and to love
you. You will be amazed how

00:19:02.339 --> 00:19:06.737
people, once they start working for Sahaja
Yoga,

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:11.804
how they are blessed from every angle.

00:19:13.738 --> 00:19:20.719
So, one has to decide in their own minds

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:28.623
that all your dreams have to come true.

00:19:28.823 --> 00:19:35.431
So only thing what you have to do is
to know only that

00:19:35.632 --> 00:19:43.933
your purpose of life is to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

00:19:44.869 --> 00:19:48.256
Even now many Sahaja yogis write to Me,

00:19:48.457 --> 00:19:50.904
"Mother, this is happening to me, that is
happening,

00:19:51.104 --> 00:19:57.681
my father like that, mother like that" -
but very few.

00:19:57.881 --> 00:20:01.898
Practically this is over now.

00:20:02.373 --> 00:20:09.288
They used to write, I should say, all such
letters,

00:20:09.488 --> 00:20:14.987
but now I think they are all been perfected,
I don't know what has happened.

00:20:15.188 --> 00:20:24.792
It's a very unique time where there's light
everywhere,

00:20:27.444 --> 00:20:36.042
the nature is absolutely with you. You can
see how nature acts,

00:20:36.243 --> 00:20:40.338
how it is trying to help you and support
you,

00:20:40.539 --> 00:20:44.759
and how it wants to work out everything
for you.

00:20:44.959 --> 00:20:52.174
It is to be just understood and felt

00:20:52.770 --> 00:21:02.239
that you are something very special, and
that you have all the help,

00:21:02.439 --> 00:21:09.859
everyone of you. It's not one person,
two persons,

00:21:10.059 --> 00:21:17.382
it's not ten persons who - it's the whole
lot, as if the whole ocean

00:21:17.583 --> 00:21:27.079
is there to help you, help you to swim over
to save so many.

00:21:27.279 --> 00:21:35.895
You haven't seen such an ocean where there
is so much depth,

00:21:36.096 --> 00:21:41.438
and all the waves try to save you,

00:21:41.638 --> 00:21:51.148
to make you float in the realm of joy.

00:21:51.926 --> 00:21:59.328
All this has happened to you because there
is a purpose.

00:21:59.529 --> 00:22:04.441
It's not just because you have done poorva
punyas and all that.

00:22:04.642 --> 00:22:10.973
Many people say, "Because of previous life
we have got it".

00:22:12.938 --> 00:22:16.731
That is true. The cause may be that,

00:22:16.932 --> 00:22:24.181
but the result is that now you are capable
of giving realization to people,

00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:26.987
and this is what you have to do.

00:22:27.187 --> 00:22:33.316
All the way you have come here in this
wilderness.

00:22:34.235 --> 00:22:40.349
From this wilderness only, you will rise

00:22:40.550 --> 00:22:44.987
and you will bless all the people
of the world.

00:22:45.187 --> 00:22:49.345
Specially America should be blessed again
and again,

00:22:49.545 --> 00:23:01.890
because it's the Virat, it is Shri
Krishna's land,

00:23:02.319 --> 00:23:10.357
because people will always try to follow,
to copy you.

00:23:10.903 --> 00:23:16.152
Things will improve

00:23:17.041 --> 00:23:25.823
if you get the, we can say the blessings

00:23:26.024 --> 00:23:31.481
of the various lotuses you have within
yourself, no doubt.

00:23:31.681 --> 00:23:37.478
But what about you doing something,

00:23:38.391 --> 00:23:46.339
what about you doing something about it?
And this is what is very important.

00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:51.958
Now only thing what you have to do about
yourself

00:23:52.337 --> 00:24:02.356
is to find out about your own activities,

00:24:02.601 --> 00:24:06.458
what activities you have been doing.

00:24:06.631 --> 00:24:13.985
You have to find out what have you done,
and what you can do.

00:24:14.185 --> 00:24:22.149
When you meditate you think about yourself,
how much you have grown,

00:24:22.350 --> 00:24:28.191
what have you done, what have you given
to others.

00:24:28.391 --> 00:24:33.516
Whatever you've got, unless and until you
distribute it, it won't increase.

00:24:33.716 --> 00:24:39.032
That is the fundamental law, and that
works. I've seen people

00:24:39.232 --> 00:24:45.335
who are realized souls, who are very good,

00:24:45.535 --> 00:24:48.623
who know everything about Sahaja Yog

00:24:48.824 --> 00:24:58.316
but are not yet that much confident,
I should say, or that much deep.

00:24:58.517 --> 00:25:05.885
All this is only possible if you yourself

00:25:06.086 --> 00:25:14.133
get into creating new Sahaja yogis,

00:25:15.339 --> 00:25:20.089
and more Sahaja yogis - not for popularity,

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:26.591
but for their good and for the good
of the whole.

00:25:28.227 --> 00:25:33.007
I was asked that I should come and stay
in America

00:25:33.208 --> 00:25:38.968
so America will improve very much. So now
here I am.

00:25:39.168 --> 00:25:42.340
I came here, I stayed here,

00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:50.039
and I am definitely putting all My
attention,

00:25:50.239 --> 00:25:57.736
because it's a very important, very, very
important chakra

00:25:57.937 --> 00:26:04.976
which is this, which is America.

00:26:05.219 --> 00:26:18.835
And this very important country is doing
sometimes very stupid things.

00:26:19.036 --> 00:26:22.939
I would not say that you enter into
politics - no.

00:26:23.140 --> 00:26:28.757
I would not say you get into any opposition
and form a group - no.

00:26:28.957 --> 00:26:32.891
But you also know that you have powers.

00:26:33.091 --> 00:26:38.817
Even your thought, your desire has powers.

00:26:39.017 --> 00:26:45.254
Try to experiment with it. Once you
experiment, you will find out

00:26:45.454 --> 00:26:51.607
that only the attention that you put
to these things, it will work out,

00:26:51.892 --> 00:26:55.642
I am sure it will work out.

00:26:57.162 --> 00:27:04.623
It is a country which can definitely help

00:27:06.003 --> 00:27:10.396
for the emancipation of the whole human
beings.

00:27:10.596 --> 00:27:16.427
But on the contrary, it is going
on the other way round.

00:27:17.125 --> 00:27:20.349
I mean, American culture, I don't
understand at all

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:28.740
what is American culture is. Is something -

00:27:29.518 --> 00:27:33.840
they say something, do something else.

00:27:34.475 --> 00:27:43.834
They've no proper value system which is
accepted by everyone,

00:27:44.034 --> 00:27:49.038
which is built traditionally from days
together.

00:27:49.294 --> 00:27:56.675
The value system is so convoluted,
so twisted

00:27:56.876 --> 00:28:03.087
that it's only a Sahaja yogi by his
nobility, by his greatness

00:28:03.288 --> 00:28:07.503
can disentangle these people.

00:28:08.456 --> 00:28:15.232
They have funny ideas, and those funny
ideas should not

00:28:15.433 --> 00:28:21.726
deter you, should not stop you; for you
know that they are stupid,

00:28:21.926 --> 00:28:31.217
they are destructive and they will destroy
all the, all the good qualities.

00:28:31.765 --> 00:28:37.818
You should know that the responsibility
of Americans

00:28:38.019 --> 00:28:44.401
is much greater than the responsibility
of any other Sahaja yogis,

00:28:44.602 --> 00:28:51.871
because they are accepted and regarded

00:28:53.253 --> 00:29:09.542
as the most competent people, as the most
effective people by the divine Power.

00:29:09.743 --> 00:29:16.973
Divine Power thinks that now you can go
all ahead,

00:29:17.174 --> 00:29:21.504
you can do so much, and let us see.

00:29:21.704 --> 00:29:26.614
Like we have the power and the machinery,

00:29:26.815 --> 00:29:34.432
but the machinery if it doesn't work, what's
the use of the power? It is useless.

00:29:34.633 --> 00:29:41.931
So the machinery has to work, and it is
working, it is spreading,

00:29:42.132 --> 00:29:45.877
but we have to double our efforts.

00:29:46.077 --> 00:29:50.989
I was thinking of doing some sort
of a social work here

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:57.367
so that it will go, it will be caught
in the eyes of many people.

00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:03.433
On a subtler level we have worked,

00:30:26.396 --> 00:30:32.878
but now we have to work it on the surface.

00:30:33.078 --> 00:30:42.244
Subtler level we are there, we have
achieved and we can achieve much more.

00:30:42.445 --> 00:30:50.177
But we should come out of it and think
what can we do on the surface,

00:30:50.378 --> 00:30:58.540
so that people see what is Sahaja Yoga is,
and what it can do to people.

00:30:59.552 --> 00:31:09.041
It's your personal behavior, your collective
behavior, your national behavior,

00:31:09.242 --> 00:31:17.790
all are going to change the atmosphere
which is supposed to be superficial,

00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:22.204
so that that also becomes subtler.

00:31:22.404 --> 00:31:28.915
I've been saying this in many places, but
at this puja I think it is important to say

00:31:29.116 --> 00:31:32.778
that if you are really facing the Adi
Shakti,

00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:38.468
then you must know your powers are
boundless.

00:31:40.052 --> 00:31:45.604
You have to just assert those powers.

00:31:45.908 --> 00:31:51.800
It is not a stationary power. It’s, there's
a movement in it,

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.434
and there's a right type of a movement.

00:31:55.634 --> 00:32:00.221
It knows where to enter, how to work it
out. Now look at this place.

00:32:00.421 --> 00:32:05.955
Can you imagine Me thinking about a place
like this?

00:32:06.156 --> 00:32:09.893
But I was just had in mind of course,
I must say,

00:32:10.093 --> 00:32:13.809
that we should have some place here,
because

00:32:14.010 --> 00:32:20.713
the American Sahaja yogis didn't have any
place to meet - that's all.

00:32:20.914 --> 00:32:23.882
And see how I got it!

00:32:24.082 --> 00:32:29.836
But the desire to do all this

00:32:30.036 --> 00:32:36.463
should be there within your subtler level,
and then it works.

00:32:36.664 --> 00:32:40.244
It works, it's like a magic, I tell you.

00:32:40.444 --> 00:32:46.440
Now you have faith in yourself and decide
about it.

00:32:46.641 --> 00:32:54.510
I am so very happy that it has been
achieved

00:32:54.710 --> 00:33:01.022
with such ease - unbelievable, with such
ease.

00:33:01.223 --> 00:33:07.259
Absolutely, nothing great was done.

00:33:07.459 --> 00:33:12.492
The way we got this was so simple,

00:33:12.692 --> 00:33:18.200
that just like another Sahaja yogi
the person was to sell us

00:33:18.401 --> 00:33:25.737
came down so excited, and he just sold it
to us, finished.

00:33:26.285 --> 00:33:31.829
We didn't have to do anything to convince
him

00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:39.293
or to talk to him or reduce the price -
nothing. And he sold it out to us.

00:33:39.494 --> 00:33:45.079
In the same way whatever on a subtler level
you desire,

00:33:45.279 --> 00:33:51.547
it becomes a terrific force which moves
by itself,

00:33:51.747 --> 00:34:02.848
which knows where to go, how to enter, into
which area, and it gets the thing done.

00:34:03.079 --> 00:34:12.138
It's something we all should experience,
and work it out with full confidence.

00:34:12.338 --> 00:34:17.993
It is the love that we have, the concern
we have.

00:34:18.193 --> 00:34:24.768
This is the power that has given us
Self-realization, and this is the power

00:34:24.968 --> 00:34:30.746
that has given us this enrichment
of achievements.

00:34:30.947 --> 00:34:35.972
I am sure all of you who are here will
realize

00:34:36.172 --> 00:34:41.235
how it was done - I mean, so quickly.
This is one of the things

00:34:41.435 --> 00:34:49.954
that should just tell you what we are
capable of doing,

00:34:51.292 --> 00:34:54.281
what we are capable of achieving.

00:34:54.482 --> 00:35:03.634
And when you think of so many people who
are lost in the mire of ignorance,

00:35:03.834 --> 00:35:08.633
we should really feel from inside that
concern

00:35:08.834 --> 00:35:19.034
and that hankering, "How can I help these
people?"

00:35:19.359 --> 00:35:23.600
And you'll be amazed, once you think like
that,

00:35:23.801 --> 00:35:28.093
how this divine Power, this Force, will
come in.

00:35:28.293 --> 00:35:36.939
Forget about petty things and petty
problems, they're nothing.

00:35:37.139 --> 00:35:41.434
You have such a powerful thing behind you.

00:35:41.634 --> 00:35:47.306
It's true that all this universe was
created, everything was created

00:35:47.506 --> 00:35:50.599
and then you were created, and all that
is done.

00:35:50.799 --> 00:35:55.145
But the greatest thing this Power has done
is to create

00:35:55.345 --> 00:35:59.457
Sahaja yogis. This is the greatest thing.

00:35:59.657 --> 00:36:07.784
Those who have knowledge, those who have
the pure knowledge

00:36:07.985 --> 00:36:15.571
and those who have the divine love in their
heart,

00:36:15.772 --> 00:36:21.139
what a tremendous personality it is. Just
think of that,

00:36:21.339 --> 00:36:29.792
and you will get all the opportunities
to express that love.

00:36:29.992 --> 00:36:33.350
So may God bless you.
