02:14.360 --> 02:17.402
You can sit here also, some of you, it’s good...

03:05.277 --> 03:07.402
I think you can come here, there is room.

03:07.526 --> 03:11.484
Some of you can move here so that they can also come here,

03:12.277 --> 03:13.818
so it won’t be a problem.

03:19.277 --> 03:21.860
You sit in front here.

03:27.734 --> 03:29.985
You are better, you see.

03:31.693 --> 03:33.484
Good.

03:43.068 --> 03:46.277
Open this door, would be all right.

04:08.484 --> 04:11.026
It’s all right, you can open the door if you like.

04:11.277 --> 04:13.152
It’s all right.

04:15.568 --> 04:18.277
Better open – these doors cannot be opened?

04:21.442 --> 04:23.277
They don’t open?

04:24.193 --> 04:28.277
Oh, my God! You need a tall person.

04:31.609 --> 04:32.943
You need Hanumana!

04:33.277 --> 04:35.818
Take His name and He’ll open!

04:47.277 --> 04:51.609
Keep a chair in front of that.

05:18.026 --> 05:22.402
Today we have come here

05:25.326 --> 05:27.617
to do Hanumana’s Puja.

05:28.277 --> 05:34.734
Shri Hanumana is a great character in our being,

05:36.152 --> 05:41.734
and He runs all the way from Swadisthana to your brain.

05:44.443 --> 05:49.693
And He supplies all the necessary guidance we need

05:50.026 --> 05:52.526
in our futuristic planning,

05:52.901 --> 05:58.818
or in our mental activities;

05:59.568 --> 06:04.568
He gives us guidance and protection.

06:10.943 --> 06:15.068
As you know that Germany is a place where

06:15.818 --> 06:20.193
people are very active, very right-sided,

06:20.818 --> 06:25.068
use their brain too much,

06:25.526 --> 06:29.442
and they are very machine-oriented also.

06:30.693 --> 06:35.318
It is very surprising how a deity like Shri Hanumana,

06:36.026 --> 06:39.026
who is an eternal child

06:39.402 --> 06:43.443
– because He was like a monkey,

06:43.693 --> 06:45.402
His head was that of a monkey,

06:45.609 --> 06:49.568
if not of an elephant – so He was an eternal child,

06:49.818 --> 06:54.734
and He was the one who was used

06:55.026 --> 06:58.402
to run the right side of human beings.

07:01.609 --> 07:04.818
He was told that “You must control the sun.”

07:05.442 --> 07:07.609
To begin with He has to control the sun,

07:07.776 --> 07:10.651
that the sun in the people,

07:10.943 --> 07:12.235
if there is too much sun

07:12.442 --> 07:13.985
then He must try to control it

07:14.235 --> 07:19.734
and make it cooler, or smoother.

07:20.776 --> 07:26.360
So – He was a child after all, so as soon He was born,

07:26.609 --> 07:30.235
when He knew that He has to look after the sun,

07:30.484 --> 07:31.943
He said, “Why not eat it off?”

07:32.193 --> 07:38.318
So He went, ran up the Virata’s body and ate up the Surya.

07:39.693 --> 07:40.818
There He had to be told,

07:40.985 --> 07:42.442
“No, no, no, no, You have to control Him.

07:42.526 --> 07:44.985
You don’t have to put Him inside your stomach!”

07:45.277 --> 07:49.734
– because He thought that this sun

07:50.068 --> 07:53.568
will be controlled better if He has it in His own stomach.

07:54.068 --> 08:00.402
So the beauty of His character is that

08:00.609 --> 08:06.484
He’s a child, and the child like behavior of Shri Hanumana

08:06.901 --> 08:11.568
has to control the right side,

08:12.693 --> 08:16.568
if there’s a right-sided mother or a right-sided father.

08:17.026 --> 08:21.152
Normally right-sided people don’t get children, normally.

08:21.734 --> 08:23.943
They’re over-right-sided,

08:24.277 --> 08:25.568
then even they get children,

08:25.776 --> 08:28.026
but they are really not liked by the children

08:28.277 --> 08:30.277
because they have no time for children,

08:30.443 --> 08:32.776
they all the time are very strict with the children,

08:32.985 --> 08:35.152
they shout them, shout at them,

08:35.360 --> 08:37.402
they don’t know how to handle the children.

08:37.776 --> 08:40.443
Or they’re over-indulgent,

08:40.901 --> 08:44.235
because they always think that “I never got this,

08:44.443 --> 08:46.568
so let me give it to the child.”

08:47.235 --> 08:49.277
So these extreme type of people

08:49.526 --> 08:54.026
who are right-sided

08:55.693 --> 09:00.360
have got this Hanumana, who is nothing but a child.

09:01.568 --> 09:08.152
He is very anxious, very anxious

09:08.360 --> 09:10.443
to do the work of Shri Rama.

09:10.776 --> 09:14.152
Now Shri Rama is a character, I would say,

09:14.402 --> 09:18.693
which is full of balance, absolutely.

09:18.985 --> 09:22.443
He’s the benevolent king which Socrates has described.

09:23.152 --> 09:27.193
So He needed somebody with Him all the time

09:28.068 --> 09:33.693
to do the work,

09:34.402 --> 09:40.318
or to supply Him or to help Him

09:40.734 --> 09:43.568
– like a secretary you can call Him;

09:44.860 --> 09:47.442
and Shri Hanumana was the one

09:47.693 --> 09:50.152
who was created for this purpose.

09:51.193 --> 09:53.360
Now Shri Rama (Shri Mataji may mean Shri Hanumana)

09:53.609 --> 09:58.152
was such a assistant;

09:58.402 --> 10:01.193
I mean, you cannot have such a word for Him.

10:01.402 --> 10:03.943
We can say He was such a servant of Shri Rama

10:04.193 --> 10:06.152
– even the servants, you see,

10:06.360 --> 10:10.484
don’t have that much of dedication for their master.

10:12.568 --> 10:14.901
We can say like a dog or a horse,

10:15.152 --> 10:22.068
but that also doesn’t have – such dedication for Shri Rama,

10:22.443 --> 10:30.360
that by the time He grew up He got “nau” nine siddhis,

10:30.568 --> 10:32.402
navadha siddhis.

10:32.609 --> 10:34.609
Nine siddhis He got.

10:35.776 --> 10:41.484
These siddhis are like this, that He could become big,

10:42.152 --> 10:45.693
He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him;

10:46.901 --> 10:50.068
He could become so sukshma that nobody could see Him,

10:50.277 --> 10:53.068
He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.568
There are nine siddhis that He got.

10:58.193 --> 11:05.068
So a person who has got the right side too much in him,

11:05.360 --> 11:08.776
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

11:12.484 --> 11:18.360
Now, how will He control a man who is running very fast

11:18.818 --> 11:19.943
in his life?

11:20.360 --> 11:24.402
What He does is to control his movement,

11:24.693 --> 11:26.443
He makes him in such a way

11:26.776 --> 11:31.402
that he has to put down his speed.

11:31.776 --> 11:34.443
He makes his feet very heavy;

11:35.026 --> 11:37.443
now he can’t do that much.

11:37.609 --> 11:41.026
Or He makes his hands very heavy,

11:41.277 --> 11:45.026
so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

11:45.360 --> 11:56.068
So He can give a tremendous kind of a lethargic heaviness

11:56.360 --> 12:02.152
to a person who is a very right-sided person.

12:05.152 --> 12:09.484
He has got another siddhis which are very interesting, is

12:09.693 --> 12:17.277
that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons,

12:17.443 --> 12:19.776
He has only one gadaa in His hand

12:20.277 --> 12:27.484
– and He can extend His tail to any extent,

12:27.818 --> 12:32.026
and He can handle people with His tails,

12:32.277 --> 12:33.901
He does not have to use His hand.

12:34.068 --> 12:37.901
Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.

12:38.193 --> 12:43.068
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail

12:43.402 --> 12:44.402
and sit on that.

12:44.693 --> 12:47.110
Like He has all these monkey-tricks

12:47.360 --> 12:48.943
as you’re to call them, you see,

12:49.318 --> 12:52.943
and all these things He has within Himself

12:53.318 --> 12:56.193
is to control a person

12:56.484 --> 13:00.110
who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.

13:00.360 --> 13:02.985
Then He can fly in the air.

13:03.235 --> 13:09.860
Just, He doesn’t have any wings,

13:10.110 --> 13:12.193
but He can just fly in the air.

13:12.526 --> 13:16.360
That means He can become so big

13:16.860 --> 13:20.318
that the amount of air He displaces

13:20.609 --> 13:24.985
has a much more weight than His own weight

13:25.193 --> 13:27.068
– just the same principle Archimedes,

13:27.318 --> 13:29.110
if you know the Archimedes principle

13:29.442 --> 13:32.943
– that He becomes so big that His body

13:33.193 --> 13:38.442
starts floating in the air, like a boat, you see, you can call it.

13:38.734 --> 13:41.402
And He can fly in the air,

13:41.609 --> 13:49.860
and by flying in the air He can carry the messages

13:50.110 --> 13:53.860
from one to another, through the ether.

13:54.193 --> 13:57.943
Now the subtle of the ether that we have

13:58.360 --> 14:04.776
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

14:05.068 --> 14:07.235
He is the one who controls,

14:07.651 --> 14:11.193
or He’s the Lord of this ether, the subtle of the ether

14:11.651 --> 14:14.734
or say, the causal of the ether; and through it,

14:14.943 --> 14:16.110
it communicates.

14:16.442 --> 14:18.734
All the communications that you find,

14:18.943 --> 14:23.442
like we have within ourselves also ductless glands

14:23.734 --> 14:27.068
which the pituitary is using, ductless glands,

14:27.235 --> 14:30.860
is through Hanumana’s movement;

14:31.402 --> 14:34.318
because He can go into a nirakar,

14:34.526 --> 14:36.651
He can go into a formless state.

14:36.860 --> 14:38.193
Also the communications,

14:38.402 --> 14:40.402
we use it for this communication that we have,

14:40.985 --> 14:46.068
maybe we can say that there’s a, we have got a loudspeaker,

14:46.402 --> 14:49.985
but we have a television, we have got radios

14:50.318 --> 14:51.734
and all those things.

14:51.985 --> 14:54.193
Where we catch on to the ether,

14:54.442 --> 14:59.776
anything is all the blessings of Hanumana,

15:00.068 --> 15:03.651
and are available to people who are right-sided.

15:04.068 --> 15:09.818
Only the right-sided people discover these things

15:09.985 --> 15:14.484
of the space, which we call as a cordless telephone

15:14.651 --> 15:19.068
or a thing without – we have also telegraphs and,

15:19.277 --> 15:24.152
where we don’t use any wires.

15:24.734 --> 15:27.734
So without any connection through the ether,

15:27.943 --> 15:29.110
He can manage.

15:29.318 --> 15:35.734
So all the ethereal connections has been done

15:35.985 --> 15:38.860
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

15:39.110 --> 15:42.609
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

15:42.860 --> 15:45.068
that you cannot challenge it,

15:45.318 --> 15:46.860
and you cannot find faults with it.

15:47.110 --> 15:49.484
Maybe your instruments may not be all right,

15:49.818 --> 15:53.193
but as far as His ethereal work is concerned,

15:53.442 --> 15:54.985
He’s perfectly there.

15:55.318 --> 15:58.193
Now the scientists discover it and think that

15:58.402 --> 16:03.985
it is in the nature, but they never think, how can it be?

16:04.402 --> 16:06.318
We say something in the ether

16:06.526 --> 16:09.484
and how is it, it is received on the other end?

16:09.734 --> 16:12.443
They just take it for granted that it is so, that

16:12.609 --> 16:16.526
we say something here or we relay something

16:16.860 --> 16:20.318
on the television and it is seen the other side.

16:20.443 --> 16:25.734
But they never even think or search out how it is done,

16:26.068 --> 16:27.026
what is the way.

16:27.318 --> 16:32.318
And this is what is the work of Shri Hanumana,

16:32.526 --> 16:39.526
who has done such a beautiful network,

16:40.068 --> 16:43.860
and through that network all these things work out.

16:44.318 --> 16:47.734
So even on the right side

16:48.235 --> 16:54.901
the vibrations we get in the molecules,

16:56.318 --> 16:59.609
as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide,

16:59.860 --> 17:02.068
if you have the sulfur, has two oxygen,

17:02.235 --> 17:06.651
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

17:06.901 --> 17:09.360
They are asymmetric, symmetric type of vibrations,

17:09.526 --> 17:10.985
you all must be knowing about it.

17:11.235 --> 17:14.360
So all these things, symmetric and asymmetric vibrations

17:14.651 --> 17:17.443
are created by whom? Nobody wants to know,

17:17.734 --> 17:18.985
nobody wants to find out,

17:19.193 --> 17:20.901
because after all in an atom or...

17:21.110 --> 17:25.734
So imagine, in a molecule, that deep, who does that job?

17:25.985 --> 17:30.110
It’s done by Shri Hanuman, in His subtle ways.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.443
So He has another great,

17:32.651 --> 17:40.193
great siddhi which we call as anima.

17:40.484 --> 17:43.860
Anima, anu – “anu” means a molecule,

17:44.402 --> 17:47.068
and that means it can enter into a molecule,

17:47.277 --> 17:51.277
or “renu” is the atom.

17:51.484 --> 17:54.277
It can enter into molecule or into atom.

17:54.402 --> 17:55.985
Now, many scientists think that they have,

17:56.193 --> 17:58.693
in the modern times they discovered the molecules.

17:58.860 --> 18:03.193
It’s not so, because it’s already in our oldest scriptures,

18:03.442 --> 18:07.860
description of anima is there, is of anu, renu is there,

18:08.068 --> 18:10.818
so is already described there.

18:11.402 --> 18:16.318
Now, then whatever, wherever you see

18:16.818 --> 18:20.693
the electromagnetic forces working,

18:20.860 --> 18:24.818
it is worked through Hanumana’s blessings.

18:25.068 --> 18:29.943
He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces.

18:30.277 --> 18:34.068
So now we can see that as Ganesha

18:34.318 --> 18:37.734
has got the magnetic force in Him – He’s the magnet,

18:38.068 --> 18:40.442
He’s the, He has got the magnetic force

18:40.818 --> 18:44.693
– then we can say the electromagnetic is,

18:45.693 --> 18:49.526
is the one which we call as Hanumana’s force,

18:49.818 --> 18:51.818
on the material side of it.

18:52.277 --> 18:59.068
But from the matter He goes up to the brain.

18:59.318 --> 19:05.442
So He rises from Swadisthana up to the brain,

19:05.693 --> 19:12.526
so in the brain also He creates the co-relationships

19:12.985 --> 19:18.152
of the different sides of our brain.

19:18.484 --> 19:20.277
So how much He gives us.

19:20.442 --> 19:25.609
I mean, we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

19:25.860 --> 19:29.193
then He gives us the power to think.

19:29.484 --> 19:33.985
He protects us also, that we should not think of bad things.

19:34.277 --> 19:36.277
That is, we can say that,

19:36.484 --> 19:41.484
that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

19:41.943 --> 19:47.818
then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.

19:49.193 --> 19:51.943
I hope you understand the difference between the two.

19:52.193 --> 19:55.943
Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much

19:56.193 --> 19:58.985
because you are wise, you know what is good, what is bad.

19:59.277 --> 20:01.818
But conscience is needed in a personality

20:02.193 --> 20:05.277
where he is to be controlled,

20:05.484 --> 20:09.860
and that control comes from Shri Hanumana,

20:10.152 --> 20:12.484
which is the conscience in the human being.

20:13.193 --> 20:15.734
Now this conscience which is Shri Hanumana

20:15.943 --> 20:21.860
is the subtle form of Him which gives us

20:22.152 --> 20:24.734
– is in Sanskrit called as “satasat vivekabuddhi”:

20:24.943 --> 20:28.277
means, “sat” means truth,

20:28.568 --> 20:30.734
“asat” means untruth,

20:30.985 --> 20:34.193
and “viveka” means the discrimination,

20:34.442 --> 20:38.277
and “buddhi” means the intelligence.

20:38.484 --> 20:44.609
So, intelligence to discriminate between

20:44.943 --> 20:51.277
the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.235
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

20:56.651 --> 21:01.651
if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us,

21:01.985 --> 21:03.193
He’s the adhyaksha,

21:03.442 --> 21:05.318
means He is the – I call Him

21:05.443 --> 21:07.776
as the chancellor of the university.

21:08.110 --> 21:10.443
He is the one who goes on degree to us,

21:10.734 --> 21:15.235
“Now you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.”

21:15.985 --> 21:22.443
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.

21:23.442 --> 21:25.609
So the Ganesha gives us, say,

21:25.901 --> 21:27.318
nirvichara samadhi

21:27.526 --> 21:30.526
which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness,

21:30.734 --> 21:32.526
and nirvikalpa samadhi.

21:32.985 --> 21:36.776
He gives all that, and also He gives us joy.

21:38.442 --> 21:50.776
But the understanding that this is good,

21:51.526 --> 21:54.110
this is for our benevolence,

21:55.985 --> 22:02.442
mental understanding, comes to us from Shri Hanumana.

22:02.734 --> 22:06.651
And it’s very important for Western people

22:06.901 --> 22:08.526
because it has to be mental,

22:08.776 --> 22:10.860
otherwise they won’t understand.

22:11.442 --> 22:14.443
If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract.

22:14.776 --> 22:15.985
It has to be mental.

22:16.360 --> 22:21.318
And so the mental understanding of whether it is good or bad

22:21.609 --> 22:24.360
is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

22:24.609 --> 22:29.318
Without Him, even if you become a saint

22:29.734 --> 22:32.443
you will be – of course, you are a saint

22:32.734 --> 22:35.360
and you will enjoy the saintliness;

22:35.651 --> 22:39.985
but whether this saintliness is

22:40.526 --> 22:42.526
all right if you live on Himalayas,

22:42.734 --> 22:46.609
or is all right when you go across to people

22:46.776 --> 22:49.734
to give them realization – all this scanning,

22:49.985 --> 22:52.360
this vivekabuddhi, all this scanning,

22:52.526 --> 22:56.526
all this discrimination, all this guidance,

22:56.860 --> 23:01.360
all this protection is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

23:02.442 --> 23:05.484
Germany being a country which is very, very much,

23:05.651 --> 23:08.318
I should say, an essence of right side;

23:08.860 --> 23:12.651
and because of it being such an essence of right side,

23:12.860 --> 23:16.734
is important to get the protector of right side

23:17.442 --> 23:19.443
here worshipped.

23:19.985 --> 23:24.110
But in all that vivekabuddhi,

23:24.360 --> 23:27.443
in that discrimination He knows one thing,

23:27.860 --> 23:32.443
that He’s absolutely subservient to Shri Rama.

23:33.026 --> 23:34.442
Now what is Shri Rama?

23:34.568 --> 23:36.734
Shri Rama is the benevolent king,

23:36.901 --> 23:39.110
He works for the benevolence.

23:39.442 --> 23:44.110
And Shri Rama Himself is a formal king,

23:44.318 --> 23:45.651
like sankocha, we call it – I mean,

23:45.776 --> 23:47.985
the English words are not so good to explain this,

23:48.193 --> 23:52.318
but Shri Rama is the one who is,

23:53.609 --> 23:55.734
who will not push forward Himself.

23:56.318 --> 23:58.860
He keeps back. He’s very balanced,

23:59.026 --> 24:01.651
He is a very poised person.

24:02.110 --> 24:04.526
So the Hanumana, you see,

24:04.860 --> 24:09.235
He, He is the one who is always anxious

24:09.443 --> 24:11.609
to do the work of Shri Rama, always.

24:11.901 --> 24:14.651
If Shri Rama says, “All right, you go and get the...”

24:14.985 --> 24:18.901
He told Him, “go and get the...” – sanjeevani

24:19.152 --> 24:23.026
is the kind of a herb that was needed

24:23.360 --> 24:26.110
to bring Lakshmana to life

24:26.442 --> 24:29.985
– He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him,

24:30.152 --> 24:32.901
“Now, better have it.” It’s like that sort of a person,

24:33.235 --> 24:36.776
you see, so He brought the – that’s childlike behavior of His.

24:37.026 --> 24:42.360
And the discrimination in this is that,

24:42.651 --> 24:44.776
that “If Shri Rama has asked for,

24:44.985 --> 24:46.776
whatever He asks for, I’ll do it.”

24:47.026 --> 24:50.360
So is a relationship of a, I would say,

24:50.651 --> 24:52.526
like a guru and [*]shishya.

24:52.776 --> 24:55.443
But even more than that, that the shishya

24:55.776 --> 24:59.693
is just like a subservient servant,

24:59.901 --> 25:03.026
absolutely surrendered to God,

25:05.442 --> 25:07.526
absolutely surrendered to God,

25:07.776 --> 25:09.985
and His main thing is surrender.

25:10.235 --> 25:13.985
Now see, this surrender itself

25:14.568 --> 25:17.651
shows that all those who are right-sided people

25:17.860 --> 25:22.901
are surrendered to God, not surrendered to their bosses.

25:23.152 --> 25:25.026
Mostly all those right-sided people

25:25.235 --> 25:26.776
are very surrendered to their bosses,

25:27.026 --> 25:28.985
surrendered to their jobs,

25:29.277 --> 25:31.693
sometimes surrendered to their wives also.

25:32.235 --> 25:35.901
But they are subservient to wrong people,

25:36.152 --> 25:38.277
they have no discretion.

25:38.693 --> 25:41.110
You’ll always find that, they have no discretion.

25:41.360 --> 25:44.152
But if you take the help of Hanumana,

25:44.360 --> 25:46.901
then He tells you that you have to be

25:47.152 --> 25:50.526
surrendered to God Almighty and not to anybody else,

25:50.693 --> 25:53.026
or to your Guru like Rama.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.443
Otherwise you are not to be surrendered to anybody else.

25:56.776 --> 25:58.526
And then you are a free bird,

25:58.693 --> 26:02.152
and you have all the nine powers within yourself.

26:02.442 --> 26:10.443
Hanumana’s whole thing is to antidote your overactivity,

26:10.693 --> 26:15.568
to antidote your too-much thinking,

26:15.901 --> 26:18.318
to antidote your ego.

26:18.568 --> 26:22.901
Now, how He finishes the ego of people

26:23.110 --> 26:27.443
is very sweetly shown when He burnt the whole of Lanka

26:27.776 --> 26:34.776
– is the capital of Ravana

26:35.443 --> 26:37.526
– and the way He made fun of him.

26:37.860 --> 26:41.360
Because you see, anybody who is egoistical,

26:41.693 --> 26:44.693
one must make fun of him, then he’s all right.

26:44.985 --> 26:50.110
Like first He went and when Ravana saw Him,

26:50.235 --> 26:53.526
he said, “Who are You? Who are You, the monkey?”

26:53.860 --> 26:57.152
So He just pushed His tail towards him,

26:57.443 --> 27:00.860
and tickled his nose with His tail.

27:03.693 --> 27:08.693
So He’s the one who makes fun of egoistical people.

27:08.985 --> 27:11.360
Now, if somebody egoistical tries to trouble you,

27:11.651 --> 27:14.651
He’s the one; He’ll make such fun out of him

27:14.901 --> 27:17.442
that you’ll be amazed how this fellow was jumping,

27:17.568 --> 27:19.442
like a Humpty-Dumpty has fallen down

27:19.651 --> 27:20.693
and has broken his crown.

27:20.985 --> 27:23.901
So you see, it is the job of Hanumana

27:24.110 --> 27:27.860
to protect you from egoistical people.

27:28.110 --> 27:30.651
And also He protects the egoistical people

27:30.985 --> 27:35.442
by showing them down – like, say, Saddam.

27:35.734 --> 27:39.484
In the case of Saddam I just asked Hanumana to do the job,

27:39.734 --> 27:41.193
because I know He’ll do it.

27:41.484 --> 27:44.818
Now, how He has put this Saddam

27:45.068 --> 27:47.152
into different circumstances,

27:47.443 --> 27:49.734
that he doesn’t know what to do,

27:50.026 --> 27:52.360
he doesn’t know how to go.

27:52.443 --> 27:55.568
Because supposing he says, “All right, I’ll have war”;

27:55.901 --> 27:58.818
so the whole of Iraq will be finished,

27:59.277 --> 28:00.277
he’ll be finished,

28:00.443 --> 28:03.360
Kuwait will be finished, all petrol will be finished, all right.

28:03.568 --> 28:04.943
Everybody will be in trouble.

28:05.193 --> 28:08.026
But what about him? – he won’t be there, too.

28:08.443 --> 28:10.193
Because if the Americans have to fight,

28:10.402 --> 28:12.443
they will go in his place and fight.

28:12.734 --> 28:14.068
They won’t fight in America,

28:14.318 --> 28:16.277
he’s not going to go to America to fight them.

28:16.402 --> 28:17.734
Few Americans may be dead.

28:18.152 --> 28:21.943
So now, in this Saddam’s brain

28:22.152 --> 28:24.068
also Hanumana is working and telling him,

28:24.277 --> 28:29.693
“Now see, Mister, if you do like this, then this will happen.”

28:32.776 --> 28:35.152
He works into the brains of all the politicians,

28:35.443 --> 28:37.360
all these egoistical people.

28:37.776 --> 28:41.776
And then, then they get sometimes stunned,

28:42.026 --> 28:43.693
sometimes they change their policies,

28:43.943 --> 28:47.943
they come round and that’s how they manage.

28:48.235 --> 28:53.943
Also another great quality of Hanumana is that He makes,

28:54.609 --> 28:59.568
makes people – sort of an arbitrator He is

28:59.901 --> 29:02.484
– He makes people meet each other.

29:03.152 --> 29:05.068
And two egoistical people,

29:05.277 --> 29:06.568
He will make them meet,

29:06.776 --> 29:08.818
and then He’ll create such situation

29:09.068 --> 29:11.776
that they both become friends and become mild.

29:12.026 --> 29:19.235
So His whole character within us acts us to see our ego,

29:19.568 --> 29:23.360
discriminate that “Oh, this is my ego that is working,”

29:23.484 --> 29:29.068
and then to become childlike and sweet,

29:29.360 --> 29:30.901
mirthful and happy.

29:31.152 --> 29:32.776
He’s always in a dancing mood,

29:33.026 --> 29:34.568
all the time He’s dancing,

29:34.776 --> 29:38.277
and before Rama He’s always bowed down,

29:38.609 --> 29:43.943
and always wants to do whatever is the desire of Shri Ram.

29:44.277 --> 29:47.235
So if Ganesha stands behind Me,

29:47.360 --> 29:49.609
Hanumana stands here at My feet,

29:49.943 --> 29:51.068
and He’s there.

29:51.402 --> 29:55.693
In the same way I would say, if Germany – as Philip,

29:55.943 --> 30:00.277
he has asked Me that if

30:00.776 --> 30:03.609
Germany can become like Hanumana

30:04.152 --> 30:06.152
– then what a dynamic force we have,

30:06.568 --> 30:08.818
if they become so subservient.

30:09.277 --> 30:14.068
And the subservient nature of Hanumana

30:14.484 --> 30:16.360
is seen to such an extent that,

30:16.818 --> 30:18.402
as you know the story of Sita

30:18.651 --> 30:21.277
when She gave a necklace to Him

30:21.484 --> 30:25.402
and He wouldn’t wear it, because inside there was no Ram.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.860
Once, Sita felt that all the time He is around,

30:30.110 --> 30:34.901
and so He’s sort of cutting out Her privacy.

30:35.235 --> 30:40.235
So She said, “Now, You can be there only for one work.

30:40.443 --> 30:41.901
You need not to do every work.”

30:42.026 --> 30:43.443
He used to do every work of Shri Rama.

30:43.734 --> 30:45.568
She said, “For one work You should be there.

30:45.776 --> 30:47.026
Choose whichever work You want to do.”

30:47.235 --> 30:52.442
He said, “Only, you see, I would like to be with Shri Ram,

30:52.568 --> 30:55.860
that whenever He sneezes I should do like this.”

30:56.026 --> 30:57.318
You see, in India when we sneeze,

30:57.443 --> 30:58.651
we have to do like this with this;

30:58.901 --> 31:01.152
because the sneezing is, you see, avoids,

31:01.442 --> 31:05.443
to avoid all the negativity to go out.

31:05.651 --> 31:07.318
So we do like this if you sneeze.

31:07.651 --> 31:13.651
Or if you feel sleepy

31:15.026 --> 31:19.235
and you yawn, then also we do like that, mostly.

31:19.484 --> 31:24.068
So He said, “Whenever He’ll yawn, You allow Me just to...”

31:24.442 --> 31:25.526
– this we call as chutki,

31:25.734 --> 31:28.110
I don’t know what you call this, chutki –

31:28.318 --> 31:30.110
“allow Me to do this.”

31:30.609 --> 31:32.734
Sita said, “This is something very little work,

31:32.943 --> 31:34.943
you see, this fellow then will be out of sight.”

31:35.360 --> 31:36.484
So He stood there.

31:36.943 --> 31:38.860
So She said, “Now, why are You standing here?”

31:39.068 --> 31:41.235
“I am waiting for that.

31:45.860 --> 31:47.985
So how can I go?”

31:48.609 --> 31:51.484
And that’s how – She granted, first She granted,

31:51.651 --> 31:52.943
“All right, given to You this job,”

31:53.193 --> 31:55.943
now She can’t take it back because She’s granted this job.

31:56.110 --> 31:59.818
So He’s always there like this standing,

31:59.985 --> 32:02.402
just to do this to Shri Ram.

32:02.609 --> 32:05.068
So I mean, the sweetness of the whole thing

32:05.318 --> 32:10.651
is that every time, every minute He is subservient,

32:10.985 --> 32:13.943
He’s attentive, He’s there.

32:14.651 --> 32:19.068
Also in Sahaja Yoga

32:21.068 --> 32:27.442
I have relationships with you as a Guru, as a Mother

32:32.484 --> 32:34.818
and, I don’t know, unlimited.

32:35.068 --> 32:38.110
But still these two relationships we know of,

32:38.318 --> 32:40.609
that I’m your Mother and I’m your Guru.

32:40.943 --> 32:43.734
Now My – as a Guru,

32:44.068 --> 32:47.193
My main concern is that

32:47.609 --> 32:50.526
you should learn all about Sahaja Yog,

32:50.943 --> 32:54.318
you should become experts of Sahaja Yoga,

32:54.484 --> 32:57.068
and you should become yourself the gurus.

32:57.277 --> 32:59.235
It’s the only concern I have.

32:59.484 --> 33:02.068
But for that, complete surrender is required.

33:02.318 --> 33:03.985
“Islam” means surrender.

33:04.318 --> 33:05.609
So you have to surrender.

33:05.860 --> 33:07.277
If you are surrendered,

33:07.484 --> 33:10.526
then only you can learn what is the,

33:10.818 --> 33:17.526
what is the way you will handle Sahaja Yoga.

33:17.818 --> 33:20.402
Now, even this surrendering

33:20.734 --> 33:23.110
is done by Shri Hanumana.

33:23.443 --> 33:26.568
He’s the one who teaches you how to surrender now

33:26.860 --> 33:28.985
or makes you surrender,

33:29.360 --> 33:32.235
because egoistical people don’t surrender.

33:32.442 --> 33:36.318
Then He puts some sort of hurdles

33:36.443 --> 33:40.318
or some sort of miracles or some tricks,

33:40.776 --> 33:48.443
by which then a disciple surrenders himself to the Guru.

33:48.776 --> 33:50.235
Otherwise he’s not surrendered,

33:50.443 --> 33:52.442
he finds it difficult to surrender,

33:52.776 --> 33:59.235
and the force that acts to make him surrender to the Guru

33:59.360 --> 34:02.026
is also that of Hanumana.

34:03.776 --> 34:05.901
So not that He is only surrendered,

34:06.110 --> 34:08.860
but He makes others also to be surrendered.

34:09.026 --> 34:11.985
Because only the – because of ego you cannot surrender,

34:12.442 --> 34:15.235
so He’s the one who fights your ego,

34:15.568 --> 34:20.360
and He puts it down and makes you surrender.

34:20.776 --> 34:23.651
So in His own expression,

34:23.860 --> 34:30.442
I would say that what He has shown that

34:31.152 --> 34:35.901
there’s a very beautiful area of right side.

34:36.152 --> 34:40.360
If it is to be perfectly enjoyed

34:40.568 --> 34:44.651
then you should be completely surrendered to your Guru,

34:45.693 --> 34:48.443
as if you are the servant of that Guru.

34:48.609 --> 34:53.484
Whatever you have to do for that Guru,

34:53.651 --> 34:54.651
you have to do it.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.651
Of course, you must know that your Guru

34:56.860 --> 34:59.193
has to give you realization, minimum,

34:59.402 --> 35:01.402
otherwise that’s not a guru.

35:01.651 --> 35:04.609
But anybody who has given you the realization,

35:04.943 --> 35:06.943
you have to be so surrendered

35:07.193 --> 35:09.442
that you should be just like a servant,

35:09.609 --> 35:11.402
not to feel shy about it.

35:11.609 --> 35:12.985
Like I would now sometimes,

35:13.193 --> 35:15.068
you know, I am going by, say,

35:15.277 --> 35:18.110
I’m going by aeroplane,

35:18.609 --> 35:22.818
and sometimes I cannot wear My shoes

35:22.985 --> 35:25.193
because they’re so swollen up.

35:25.609 --> 35:28.068
So normally I would take the shoes in My hands

35:28.277 --> 35:29.651
and walk about.

35:29.818 --> 35:31.442
But I have seen Sahaja yogis,

35:31.609 --> 35:33.609
they pick up My shoes also and walk with it,

35:33.985 --> 35:35.985
and they don’t feel shy about it.

35:36.110 --> 35:39.402
They just feel so proud that they are carrying My shoes.

35:39.943 --> 35:41.318
So there is not

35:41.484 --> 35:44.860
– one should feel proud that you are doing all these things,

35:45.068 --> 35:48.609
that you have a chance to do all these things for your Guru,

35:48.860 --> 35:52.193
and that you are surrendering to that Guru;

35:52.318 --> 35:55.110
you are absolutely only bothered

35:55.318 --> 35:57.402
as to how you can serve the Guru,

35:57.526 --> 35:59.110
how you can please the Guru,

35:59.442 --> 36:03.318
and how you could be closer to that Guru.

36:03.651 --> 36:06.193
It doesn’t mean physical closeness

36:06.402 --> 36:10.609
but a kind of a rapport, a kind of an understanding.

36:10.860 --> 36:14.484
Even those who are away from Me can feel Me in their heart.

36:14.818 --> 36:16.651
And this is what it is, that

36:16.943 --> 36:23.442
we have to get this power from Shri Hanumana.

36:23.943 --> 36:28.402
Now, He’s the one who protects also all the deities.

36:28.609 --> 36:30.818
He protects. Now, there’s a difference

36:31.110 --> 36:34.068
between Shri Ganesha and Him.

36:34.318 --> 36:39.235
The Shri Ganesha gives energy shakti,

36:39.609 --> 36:42.442
but the one who protects is Shri Hanumana.

36:42.734 --> 36:45.402
So you’ll find that when Shri Krishna

36:45.526 --> 36:48.860
was the chariot of Arjuna,

36:49.860 --> 36:53.318
then on top of the chariot was sitting Hanumana,

36:53.484 --> 36:55.068
not Shri Ganesh.

36:55.402 --> 36:58.734
Hanumana was sitting there looking after Him.

37:00.068 --> 37:04.526
Also in a way that Shri Rama Himself becomes Shri Vishnu,

37:04.734 --> 37:07.193
so He has to look after Him.

37:08.734 --> 37:10.484
He is an angel, as you know:

37:10.734 --> 37:14.985
according to Christian, we should say according to Bible,

37:15.402 --> 37:18.526
that He is the angel called Gabriel.

37:20.734 --> 37:24.484
Now Gabriel is the one who brought the message,

37:24.734 --> 37:28.985
because He’s always a messenger, to Maria,

37:29.318 --> 37:32.609
and it’s surprisingly the words He used were

37:32.818 --> 37:37.651
“Immaculata Salve” – that’s My name.

37:37.943 --> 37:39.318
My first name is Nirmala,

37:39.526 --> 37:41.818
means “Immaculata” and surname is Salve.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.943
He said those words to Her.

37:44.318 --> 37:46.985
And today also I was surprised

37:47.484 --> 37:50.943
when it came to giving Me a present,

37:51.235 --> 37:54.985
they found a tea-set and dinner-set

37:55.318 --> 37:57.193
which is called as “Maria.”

37:57.484 --> 38:02.193
So Maria has to do quite a lot with Hanumana all Her life.

38:02.484 --> 38:05.068
That means Maria is the Mahalakshmi.

38:05.318 --> 38:10.068
Mahalakshmi being the Sita, Sita then Radha,

38:10.609 --> 38:13.484
Hanumana has to be there to serve Her.

38:13.818 --> 38:17.235
And that is why, you see, sometimes

38:17.651 --> 38:20.860
people say, “Mother, how did You know?

38:21.110 --> 38:23.193
Mother, how did You come to know?

38:23.609 --> 38:27.110
Mother, how did You send a message?

38:27.442 --> 38:30.110
Mother, how did You work it out?” Can you imagine?

38:30.402 --> 38:34.651
This is Shri Hanumana’s headache, He does it.

38:34.985 --> 38:37.068
Anything passes through My mind,

38:37.235 --> 38:38.860
He just takes it up and it’s done.

38:39.110 --> 38:42.318
Because as I told you that His whole organization

38:42.526 --> 38:44.193
is so well planned;

38:44.442 --> 38:46.526
all these messages, from where do they get them?

38:46.734 --> 38:48.734
Many people say, “Mother, I just prayed to You.”

38:49.402 --> 38:51.068
There was a gentleman

38:51.318 --> 38:52.734
whose mother was very sick

38:53.068 --> 38:54.442
and he went to see her,

38:54.734 --> 38:58.484
and she was just going to die with cancer.

38:58.818 --> 39:00.402
So he said, “I didn’t know what to do,

39:00.526 --> 39:01.484
so I just prayed to You,

39:01.651 --> 39:03.484
"Mother, please save my mother.”

39:03.734 --> 39:06.442
Now the sincerity of that person,

39:06.818 --> 39:10.609
the depth of that person as a Sahaja yogi Hanumana knows.

39:10.943 --> 39:13.818
He knows what is the weight of this person is.

39:14.734 --> 39:16.734
And immediately, you’ll be surprised,

39:16.943 --> 39:20.402
within three days the woman who was going to die survived,

39:20.609 --> 39:21.526
she got all right.

39:21.734 --> 39:24.110
He brought her to Bombay and the doctor said,

39:24.277 --> 39:26.193
“She has no cancer.”

39:27.484 --> 39:29.318
Many things which you call miracles

39:29.609 --> 39:31.860
are done by Shri Hanuman.

39:32.402 --> 39:35.860
He’s the one who is the doer of miracles.

39:36.110 --> 39:41.402
He does miracles also to show how stupid you are,

39:43.110 --> 39:44.277
how foolish you are,

39:44.526 --> 39:47.442
because He is on the right side,

39:47.609 --> 39:49.442
see He goes to the ego side.

39:49.734 --> 39:52.277
Now with the ego a human being

39:52.442 --> 39:56.442
is always becomes stupid – that’s, I mean, inevitable.

39:56.734 --> 39:59.943
With ego they become so stupid, “Oh, what’s wrong?”

40:00.402 --> 40:02.110
And that’s why you will find

40:02.402 --> 40:03.943
many people doing such stupid things,

40:04.193 --> 40:05.484
we can’t understand why they do it.

40:05.818 --> 40:07.693
They say, “What’s wrong?”

40:07.943 --> 40:12.110
What’s wrong is that Hanumana doesn’t like it is the point,

40:12.402 --> 40:15.484
and then it recoils.

40:15.985 --> 40:18.402
When they act stupidly it recoils

40:18.526 --> 40:22.402
and then they know that we have done such a big mistake,

40:22.609 --> 40:24.442
or it was all stupid.

40:24.734 --> 40:28.693
But sometimes it could be extremely, extremely

40:29.609 --> 40:32.734
difficult to retrace back;

40:32.985 --> 40:37.402
like the diseases, as I call it the yuppies disease,

40:37.609 --> 40:38.860
which is now impossible

40:39.068 --> 40:40.860
because Hanumana has taken away

40:41.068 --> 40:42.277
the electromagnetic force

40:42.442 --> 40:44.484
from these people and it doesn’t work,

40:44.734 --> 40:46.402
it doesn’t relate to your conscious mind.

40:46.609 --> 40:49.277
So your conscious mind cannot act, it just goes off.

40:49.693 --> 40:52.402
Only these people, if they worship Hanumana

40:52.693 --> 40:56.985
with the same devotion, then maybe they might be saved.

40:57.318 --> 40:59.985
But it’s not a easy thing to convince these stupid yuppies,

41:00.277 --> 41:01.442
you see, about anything.

41:01.651 --> 41:03.860
They say, “We don’t believe. So what?”

41:04.068 --> 41:05.609
So what, you die – what else?

41:05.860 --> 41:10.943
That’s the only limit, that’s the only life left for you,

41:11.110 --> 41:12.860
and you do that.

41:14.110 --> 41:16.484
There are so many aspects of Hanumana

41:16.734 --> 41:19.484
which I could have told you;

41:19.818 --> 41:23.526
but for example, for His body,

41:23.818 --> 41:27.068
you see, like Shiva is covered with the gheru.

41:27.277 --> 41:29.818
What you call gheru is a,

41:30.484 --> 41:32.693
that’s a kind of a, you know that gheru is,

41:32.943 --> 41:38.484
it’s a red-colored stone which is very, very, it is very hot.

41:38.734 --> 41:41.526
And supposing with the cold

41:41.818 --> 41:45.442
sometimes you develop those rashes,

41:45.693 --> 41:48.402
so if you put gheru those rashes are corrected.

41:48.609 --> 41:50.943
Or you get, due to badha sometimes,

41:51.193 --> 41:54.402
some sort of skin-diseases which are cured with gheru;

41:54.609 --> 41:57.068
because it is the one which is very hot,

41:57.360 --> 41:58.651
and it soothes you down.

41:58.901 --> 42:01.235
On the contrary Shri Ganesha

42:01.443 --> 42:04.360
is covered with lead oxide,

42:04.568 --> 42:07.860
with the red lead oxide which is,

42:08.110 --> 42:11.693
which is extremely cold.

42:11.985 --> 42:14.693
Lead oxide is a very cold thing.

42:14.901 --> 42:17.443
If you touch lead, you see, it’s a very cold thing.

42:17.651 --> 42:21.651
So that lead oxide is used to cover all His body,

42:22.901 --> 42:28.026
is there to balance the heat that He has,

42:28.318 --> 42:30.360
or the effects of heat He has.

42:30.568 --> 42:35.152
So we call this in Sanskrit language is called as sindhura,

42:35.526 --> 42:38.152
and also in Marathi or Hindi called shindhura.

42:38.442 --> 42:41.693
So they must find always this is the color of that thing;

42:41.901 --> 42:47.901
so luckily I got this sari in Vienna,

42:48.152 --> 42:52.693
and I have it very nice for this occasion.

42:52.985 --> 42:56.235
So He’s always covered with that color,

42:56.526 --> 42:59.442
what you call this sindhur color.

43:00.235 --> 43:05.235
And lead oxide, though they say it causes cancer,

43:05.568 --> 43:08.360
people say that lead oxide can cause you cancer;

43:08.651 --> 43:11.901
but it is the lead oxide which is very cold,

43:12.152 --> 43:13.693
it can cool you down so much

43:13.985 --> 43:15.776
that you can go to the left side.

43:16.026 --> 43:18.152
And cancer is a psychosomatic disease,

43:18.443 --> 43:21.235
and that might be the reason it might cause,

43:21.443 --> 43:23.651
in a very far-fetched way we can say,

43:23.901 --> 43:26.110
can cause cancer to you.

43:26.318 --> 43:28.651
Because if it is too cold and all that

43:29.110 --> 43:30.901
and then you go to the left side,

43:31.235 --> 43:33.860
and the left side you can catch the viruses,

43:34.152 --> 43:36.693
by which you can get into troubles.

43:37.068 --> 43:41.110
So, but the same lead oxide is all right for people

43:41.402 --> 43:44.734
who are very right-sided.

43:44.985 --> 43:48.943
For them if it is put on their Agnya it cools them down,

43:49.193 --> 43:50.402
they are cooled down.

43:50.651 --> 43:53.818
And it’s very good for them to put on their Agnya,

43:54.068 --> 43:55.318
so that they are cooled down.

43:55.526 --> 43:58.235
Their anger goes down, their temper goes down,

43:58.526 --> 44:00.442
and it’s a very good thing.

44:01.110 --> 44:03.442
So He’s the one who cures our anger,

44:03.651 --> 44:09.110
He’s the one who cures our hastiness,

44:09.526 --> 44:12.484
our speediness,

44:13.484 --> 44:15.235
our aggressiveness.

44:15.609 --> 44:17.402
He’s the one who does it.

44:17.609 --> 44:20.068
Now, He played a trick on Hitler. How?

44:20.318 --> 44:25.193
Hitler was using Shri Ganesha as a symbol,

44:25.442 --> 44:30.193
so this swastika was made in a clockwise manner.

44:30.609 --> 44:32.651
Then Hanumana played a trick on him.

44:33.110 --> 44:35.193
What He did, He made the

44:37.277 --> 44:42.193
stencil which they were using for making the,

44:43.985 --> 44:47.277
what you call the, making the swastika.

44:47.609 --> 44:52.152
He put it, somehow or other, lot of – I mean,

44:52.318 --> 44:54.860
He made it in such a way that they said,

44:54.985 --> 44:56.277
“We should use the other side.”

44:56.484 --> 45:00.442
As soon as they used the other side – it’s Hanumana’s trick;

45:00.860 --> 45:03.734
I suggested to Him, but I mean, He played the trick

45:04.152 --> 45:08.442
– they started using Ganesha from the other side.

45:08.609 --> 45:11.152
The same Ganesha about whom

45:12.860 --> 45:15.609
Shri Hanumana was worried how will He,

45:15.985 --> 45:18.068
how can He surpass Shri Ganesha,

45:18.318 --> 45:22.068
because He is the eldest, and how can you go beyond Him?

45:22.734 --> 45:26.235
And He is the deity, but Hanumana is an angel.

45:26.526 --> 45:29.860
So as soon as the trick was played,

45:30.110 --> 45:35.068
then both of them put together stopped Hitler from winning.

45:35.318 --> 45:37.651
This is how the trick was played.

45:37.901 --> 45:41.443
So all these little, little tricks, you see, are there.

45:41.776 --> 45:45.609
Once I remember I had My Puja in Germany;

45:45.985 --> 45:50.110
and Germany is the place where these tricks are played

45:50.443 --> 45:51.985
very much by Hanumana,

45:52.235 --> 45:54.860
because I have told you that they are the ones

45:55.110 --> 45:56.442
who require Him the most.

45:56.860 --> 45:59.484
So there was in Germany, there was a puja,

45:59.651 --> 46:03.360
and in the puja by mistake they put it the other way round

46:03.734 --> 46:05.068
– by mistake.

46:05.609 --> 46:08.609
I didn’t see. I, normally I always watch very carefully,

46:08.860 --> 46:10.985
but I don’t know why, that day I didn’t see it:

46:11.235 --> 46:13.068
it must be also Hanumana’s trick.

46:13.318 --> 46:15.193
And when I saw, I said,

46:15.442 --> 46:18.360
“Oh God, where is it going to now hurt?

46:18.651 --> 46:20.442
Where is it going to work out?

46:20.776 --> 46:22.734
Which country it is going to hit?”

46:22.985 --> 46:29.110
It did not hit Germany, it hit England.

46:29.360 --> 46:32.442
Because England, I have worked so hard there

46:32.609 --> 46:35.110
and they have been so negligent about Sahaja Yoga,

46:35.318 --> 46:39.110
so lethargic about it, that it just went and hit there.

46:39.442 --> 46:44.651
So He is the one who goes like a torrential rain,

46:44.943 --> 46:47.443
or can go like a speedy, very speedy

46:49.193 --> 46:51.734
tempest and destroy things.

46:51.943 --> 46:53.734
So He works out all these things

46:53.985 --> 46:56.068
through His electromagnetic forces.

46:56.318 --> 47:01.193
So all the matter, all the matter

47:02.402 --> 47:03.734
is under His control.

47:03.985 --> 47:06.193
All the matter is under His control,

47:06.484 --> 47:09.860
and He’s the one who creates rain for you,

47:10.110 --> 47:11.776
who creates sun for you,

47:12.068 --> 47:13.818
He creates breeze for you.

47:14.068 --> 47:16.484
He’s the one who does all these things

47:16.776 --> 47:19.484
just to have a proper puja,

47:19.734 --> 47:21.526
to have a proper meeting,

47:21.943 --> 47:24.442
everything He works out so beautifully.

47:24.651 --> 47:27.651
And nobody even knows that it is Shri Hanumana

47:27.818 --> 47:28.526
who has done it,

47:28.734 --> 47:32.402
and we should thank Shri Hanumana all the time.

47:33.026 --> 47:34.901
For the today’s thing, I mean, there are

47:35.235 --> 47:38.443
– I, if I have to talk about Him I’ll take hours together.

47:38.901 --> 47:43.318
But only thing I have to say that it’s a,

47:43.526 --> 47:47.651
such a blessing, I feel, that we have this in this palace,

47:48.026 --> 47:50.318
Shri Hanumana’s Puja.

47:50.443 --> 48:01.360
Because He was always a very majestic deity or a angel,

48:01.776 --> 48:06.734
and that in a place where it is so majestic

48:07.026 --> 48:09.360
and beautifully done, everything is there,

48:09.734 --> 48:11.318
and He would like that.

48:11.526 --> 48:15.734
He is not a sanyasi type of a person,

48:15.901 --> 48:16.860
He’s not an ascetic.

48:17.068 --> 48:19.277
Normally right-sided people are ascetic,

48:19.442 --> 48:23.318
they become..., they’ll make right-sided people,

48:23.609 --> 48:26.442
they’ll only have everything simple.

48:26.818 --> 48:29.152
They would like to shave off their nose also if possible,

48:29.443 --> 48:31.360
on the faces!

48:32.526 --> 48:36.026
So you see, the other way round, Hanumana is not doing.

48:36.318 --> 48:40.568
Hanumana likes beauty, He likes decorativeness,

48:41.026 --> 48:44.693
and He makes people non-ascetic,

48:44.985 --> 48:48.776
so Hanumana gives you this kind of a thing.

48:49.110 --> 48:51.693
But many people who are worshippers of Hanumana

48:52.026 --> 48:55.443
always say that those ladies should never go

48:55.651 --> 48:58.026
and take the darshan of Hanuman,

48:58.442 --> 49:00.776
because Hanumana is a brahmachari

49:01.318 --> 49:05.360
– is the one who is, who doesn’t want women to see him

49:05.860 --> 49:08.110
because he doesn’t wear full clothes

49:08.443 --> 49:11.026
– and He has very little clothes on Himself,

49:11.360 --> 49:13.110
so He doesn’t want women to see Him.

49:13.443 --> 49:15.985
But if women think He is just a child,

49:16.152 --> 49:17.443
then it’s just the same.

49:17.776 --> 49:21.235
But this idea I think the people don’t have,

49:21.442 --> 49:22.443
that He’s a child.

49:22.860 --> 49:25.026
What is for a child how many clothes he wear

49:25.235 --> 49:25.901
or doesn’t wear?

49:26.026 --> 49:27.026
And then He’s a monkey,

49:27.235 --> 49:28.693
and the monkeys are not supposed to wear clothes.

49:28.985 --> 49:30.985
So whatever He wears is quite a lot,

49:31.152 --> 49:33.693
and it doesn’t give you even the feeling at all that

49:33.901 --> 49:35.901
He’s in any way nude or anything,

49:36.110 --> 49:38.568
but you just see such a sweet form of Him,

49:38.860 --> 49:40.152
such a sweet form.

49:41.318 --> 49:44.068
I wish sometimes you’d get His photograph also,

49:44.442 --> 49:49.235
as you have got the photographs of Shri Ganesha.

49:49.484 --> 49:51.526
Then you’ll really fall in love with Him,

49:51.818 --> 49:52.609
He’s such a sweet thing.

49:52.860 --> 49:55.402
And though He is so huge and so big

49:55.818 --> 49:58.609
and though He has nails,

49:58.860 --> 50:02.318
but when He caresses My feet He pulls back His nails.

50:02.526 --> 50:05.734
He is so gentle, extremely gentle,

50:05.985 --> 50:08.943
and very beautifully He caresses My feet.

50:09.193 --> 50:12.318
And I have seen Him the way He handles everything,

50:12.526 --> 50:14.526
it’s extremely gentle ways.

50:14.818 --> 50:15.985
So that’s what I feel,

50:16.277 --> 50:18.193
that now Germans are becoming very gentle

50:18.402 --> 50:21.402
in handling things, in handling people.

50:21.651 --> 50:23.985
This change is coming, and I think

50:24.193 --> 50:26.442
is the blessing of Hanumana on them.

50:26.734 --> 50:29.818
So may God bless you.

50:34.901 --> 50:40.443
Now, so today we need not do Ganesh Puja,

50:40.776 --> 50:45.693
though a … once you can wash My feet with some song;

50:46.068 --> 50:47.818
because always before every puja

50:48.068 --> 50:52.402
one has to do Ganesha Puja, but need not be that elaborate.

51:28.398 --> 51:30.398
Just – where is Barbara?

51:30.572 --> 51:32.530
Ask her to get some hot water bottle,

51:32.689 --> 51:34.689
because Ganesha is cooling Me,

51:34.898 --> 51:37.940
the – and Hanumana is cooling Me down completely.

51:39.658 --> 51:40.658
It’s Hanumana, you see,

51:40.825 --> 51:43.033
is cooling Me down completely here from the back,

51:43.366 --> 51:46.817
and just now see how cool it’s becoming, the whole place,

51:47.135 --> 51:49.509
talking about Him.

02:56:47.781 --> 02:56:52.198
This is the present from Russia

02:56:52.656 --> 02:56:56.531
and here, see now, the color of Hanumana

02:56:56.781 --> 02:56:58.656
is exactly like My sari.

02:56:59.531 --> 02:57:02.531
And this is Hanumana, the Gabriel, just imagine:

02:57:02.781 --> 02:57:05.448
this is a Russian folk story,

02:57:05.740 --> 02:57:11.115
so Russians knew that He used to wear clothes of this color

02:57:11.406 --> 02:57:12.781
– just imagine.

02:57:13.198 --> 02:57:17.573
And He’s sitting on a horse,

02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:22.531
and also it is said that it is Gabriel

02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:28.990
who told Mohammed Sahib about the seven...

02:57:33.198 --> 02:57:36.990
He gave a horse to Mohammed Sahib

02:57:37.198 --> 02:57:42.614
to see to seven Heavens, you see, He gave.

02:57:43.573 --> 02:57:47.282
Yes, to see God Almighty on His greatness,

02:57:47.573 --> 02:57:48.906
that is the seven chakras,

02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:50.990
so Hanumana gave Him.

02:57:51.906 --> 02:57:53.448
It’s correct.

02:57:53.823 --> 02:57:56.157
Because Mohammed Sahib was on the left-hand side,

02:57:56.364 --> 02:58:00.323
He had a Chandra Ma; so He gave Him.

02:58:01.448 --> 02:58:03.823
So this is a beautiful piece.

02:58:04.531 --> 02:58:06.906
You should keep it there...

02:58:07.323 --> 02:58:11.781
But it’s made in Germany, made in Germany.
