00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.402
You can sit here also, some of you, it’s good...

00:03:05.277 --> 00:03:07.402
I think you can come here, there is room.

00:03:07.526 --> 00:03:11.484
Some of you can move here so that they can also come here,

00:03:12.277 --> 00:03:13.818
so it won’t be a problem.

00:03:19.277 --> 00:03:21.860
You sit in front here.

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:29.985
You are better, you see.

00:03:31.693 --> 00:03:33.484
Good.

00:03:43.068 --> 00:03:46.277
Open this door, would be all right.

00:04:08.484 --> 00:04:11.026
It’s all right, you can open the door if you like.

00:04:11.277 --> 00:04:13.152
It’s all right.

00:04:15.568 --> 00:04:18.277
Better open – these doors cannot be opened?

00:04:21.442 --> 00:04:23.277
They don’t open?

00:04:24.193 --> 00:04:28.277
Oh, my God! You need a tall person.

00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:32.943
You need Hanumana!

00:04:33.277 --> 00:04:35.818
Take His name and He’ll open!

00:04:47.277 --> 00:04:51.609
Keep a chair in front of that.

00:05:18.026 --> 00:05:22.402
Today we have come here

00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:27.617
to do Hanumana’s Puja.

00:05:28.277 --> 00:05:34.734
Shri Hanumana is a great character in our being,

00:05:36.152 --> 00:05:41.734
and He runs all the way from Swadisthana to your brain.

00:05:44.443 --> 00:05:49.693
And He supplies all the necessary guidance we need

00:05:50.026 --> 00:05:52.526
in our futuristic planning,

00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:58.818
or in our mental activities;

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:04.568
He gives us guidance and protection.

00:06:10.943 --> 00:06:15.068
As you know that Germany is a place where

00:06:15.818 --> 00:06:20.193
people are very active, very right-sided,

00:06:20.818 --> 00:06:25.068
use their brain too much,

00:06:25.526 --> 00:06:29.442
and they are very machine-oriented also.

00:06:30.693 --> 00:06:35.318
It is very surprising how a deity like Shri Hanumana,

00:06:36.026 --> 00:06:39.026
who is an eternal child

00:06:39.402 --> 00:06:43.443
– because He was like a monkey,

00:06:43.693 --> 00:06:45.402
His head was that of a monkey,

00:06:45.609 --> 00:06:49.568
if not of an elephant – so He was an eternal child,

00:06:49.818 --> 00:06:54.734
and He was the one who was used

00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:58.402
to run the right side of human beings.

00:07:01.609 --> 00:07:04.818
He was told that “You must control the sun.”

00:07:05.442 --> 00:07:07.609
To begin with He has to control the sun,

00:07:07.776 --> 00:07:10.651
that the sun in the people,

00:07:10.943 --> 00:07:12.235
if there is too much sun

00:07:12.442 --> 00:07:13.985
then He must try to control it

00:07:14.235 --> 00:07:19.734
and make it cooler, or smoother.

00:07:20.776 --> 00:07:26.360
So – He was a child after all, so as soon He was born,

00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:30.235
when He knew that He has to look after the sun,

00:07:30.484 --> 00:07:31.943
He said, “Why not eat it off?”

00:07:32.193 --> 00:07:38.318
So He went, ran up the Virata’s body and ate up the Surya.

00:07:39.693 --> 00:07:40.818
There He had to be told,

00:07:40.985 --> 00:07:42.442
“No, no, no, no, You have to control Him.

00:07:42.526 --> 00:07:44.985
You don’t have to put Him inside your stomach!”

00:07:45.277 --> 00:07:49.734
– because He thought that this sun

00:07:50.068 --> 00:07:53.568
will be controlled better if He has it in His own stomach.

00:07:54.068 --> 00:08:00.402
So the beauty of His character is that

00:08:00.609 --> 00:08:06.484
He’s a child, and the child like behavior of Shri Hanumana

00:08:06.901 --> 00:08:11.568
has to control the right side,

00:08:12.693 --> 00:08:16.568
if there’s a right-sided mother or a right-sided father.

00:08:17.026 --> 00:08:21.152
Normally right-sided people don’t get children, normally.

00:08:21.734 --> 00:08:23.943
They’re over-right-sided,

00:08:24.277 --> 00:08:25.568
then even they get children,

00:08:25.776 --> 00:08:28.026
but they are really not liked by the children

00:08:28.277 --> 00:08:30.277
because they have no time for children,

00:08:30.443 --> 00:08:32.776
they all the time are very strict with the children,

00:08:32.985 --> 00:08:35.152
they shout them, shout at them,

00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:37.402
they don’t know how to handle the children.

00:08:37.776 --> 00:08:40.443
Or they’re over-indulgent,

00:08:40.901 --> 00:08:44.235
because they always think that “I never got this,

00:08:44.443 --> 00:08:46.568
so let me give it to the child.”

00:08:47.235 --> 00:08:49.277
So these extreme type of people

00:08:49.526 --> 00:08:54.026
who are right-sided

00:08:55.693 --> 00:09:00.360
have got this Hanumana, who is nothing but a child.

00:09:01.568 --> 00:09:08.152
He is very anxious, very anxious

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:10.443
to do the work of Shri Rama.

00:09:10.776 --> 00:09:14.152
Now Shri Rama is a character, I would say,

00:09:14.402 --> 00:09:18.693
which is full of balance, absolutely.

00:09:18.985 --> 00:09:22.443
He’s the benevolent king which Socrates has described.

00:09:23.152 --> 00:09:27.193
So He needed somebody with Him all the time

00:09:28.068 --> 00:09:33.693
to do the work,

00:09:34.402 --> 00:09:40.318
or to supply Him or to help Him

00:09:40.734 --> 00:09:43.568
– like a secretary you can call Him;

00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.442
and Shri Hanumana was the one

00:09:47.693 --> 00:09:50.152
who was created for this purpose.

00:09:51.193 --> 00:09:53.360
Now Shri Rama (Shri Mataji may mean Shri Hanumana)

00:09:53.609 --> 00:09:58.152
was such a assistant;

00:09:58.402 --> 00:10:01.193
I mean, you cannot have such a word for Him.

00:10:01.402 --> 00:10:03.943
We can say He was such a servant of Shri Rama

00:10:04.193 --> 00:10:06.152
– even the servants, you see,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:10.484
don’t have that much of dedication for their master.

00:10:12.568 --> 00:10:14.901
We can say like a dog or a horse,

00:10:15.152 --> 00:10:22.068
but that also doesn’t have – such dedication for Shri Rama,

00:10:22.443 --> 00:10:30.360
that by the time He grew up He got “nau” nine siddhis,

00:10:30.568 --> 00:10:32.402
navadha siddhis.

00:10:32.609 --> 00:10:34.609
Nine siddhis He got.

00:10:35.776 --> 00:10:41.484
These siddhis are like this, that He could become big,

00:10:42.152 --> 00:10:45.693
He could become so heavy that nobody could lift Him;

00:10:46.901 --> 00:10:50.068
He could become so sukshma that nobody could see Him,

00:10:50.277 --> 00:10:53.068
He could become so subtle that nobody could see Him.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.568
There are nine siddhis that He got.

00:10:58.193 --> 00:11:05.068
So a person who has got the right side too much in him,

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.776
He controls him with these nine siddhis.

00:11:12.484 --> 00:11:18.360
Now, how will He control a man who is running very fast

00:11:18.818 --> 00:11:19.943
in his life?

00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.402
What He does is to control his movement,

00:11:24.693 --> 00:11:26.443
He makes him in such a way

00:11:26.776 --> 00:11:31.402
that he has to put down his speed.

00:11:31.776 --> 00:11:34.443
He makes his feet very heavy;

00:11:35.026 --> 00:11:37.443
now he can’t do that much.

00:11:37.609 --> 00:11:41.026
Or He makes his hands very heavy,

00:11:41.277 --> 00:11:45.026
so the person cannot work very much with his hands.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:56.068
So He can give a tremendous kind of a lethargic heaviness

00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:02.152
to a person who is a very right-sided person.

00:12:05.152 --> 00:12:09.484
He has got another siddhis which are very interesting, is

00:12:09.693 --> 00:12:17.277
that He can extend His – He doesn’t have many weapons,

00:12:17.443 --> 00:12:19.776
He has only one gadaa in His hand

00:12:20.277 --> 00:12:27.484
– and He can extend His tail to any extent,

00:12:27.818 --> 00:12:32.026
and He can handle people with His tails,

00:12:32.277 --> 00:12:33.901
He does not have to use His hand.

00:12:34.068 --> 00:12:37.901
Sitting down here, He can put the tail around anywhere.

00:12:38.193 --> 00:12:43.068
If He wants He can just make a mountain of His tail

00:12:43.402 --> 00:12:44.402
and sit on that.

00:12:44.693 --> 00:12:47.110
Like He has all these monkey-tricks

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:48.943
as you’re to call them, you see,

00:12:49.318 --> 00:12:52.943
and all these things He has within Himself

00:12:53.318 --> 00:12:56.193
is to control a person

00:12:56.484 --> 00:13:00.110
who is extremely right-sided, to begin with.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:02.985
Then He can fly in the air.

00:13:03.235 --> 00:13:09.860
Just, He doesn’t have any wings,

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:12.193
but He can just fly in the air.

00:13:12.526 --> 00:13:16.360
That means He can become so big

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.318
that the amount of air He displaces

00:13:20.609 --> 00:13:24.985
has a much more weight than His own weight

00:13:25.193 --> 00:13:27.068
– just the same principle Archimedes,

00:13:27.318 --> 00:13:29.110
if you know the Archimedes principle

00:13:29.442 --> 00:13:32.943
– that He becomes so big that His body

00:13:33.193 --> 00:13:38.442
starts floating in the air, like a boat, you see, you can call it.

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:41.402
And He can fly in the air,

00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:49.860
and by flying in the air He can carry the messages

00:13:50.110 --> 00:13:53.860
from one to another, through the ether.

00:13:54.193 --> 00:13:57.943
Now the subtle of the ether that we have

00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:04.776
is under the command of Shri Hanumana.

00:14:05.068 --> 00:14:07.235
He is the one who controls,

00:14:07.651 --> 00:14:11.193
or He’s the Lord of this ether, the subtle of the ether

00:14:11.651 --> 00:14:14.734
or say, the causal of the ether; and through it,

00:14:14.943 --> 00:14:16.110
it communicates.

00:14:16.442 --> 00:14:18.734
All the communications that you find,

00:14:18.943 --> 00:14:23.442
like we have within ourselves also ductless glands

00:14:23.734 --> 00:14:27.068
which the pituitary is using, ductless glands,

00:14:27.235 --> 00:14:30.860
is through Hanumana’s movement;

00:14:31.402 --> 00:14:34.318
because He can go into a nirakar,

00:14:34.526 --> 00:14:36.651
He can go into a formless state.

00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:38.193
Also the communications,

00:14:38.402 --> 00:14:40.402
we use it for this communication that we have,

00:14:40.985 --> 00:14:46.068
maybe we can say that there’s a, we have got a loudspeaker,

00:14:46.402 --> 00:14:49.985
but we have a television, we have got radios

00:14:50.318 --> 00:14:51.734
and all those things.

00:14:51.985 --> 00:14:54.193
Where we catch on to the ether,

00:14:54.442 --> 00:14:59.776
anything is all the blessings of Hanumana,

00:15:00.068 --> 00:15:03.651
and are available to people who are right-sided.

00:15:04.068 --> 00:15:09.818
Only the right-sided people discover these things

00:15:09.985 --> 00:15:14.484
of the space, which we call as a cordless telephone

00:15:14.651 --> 00:15:19.068
or a thing without – we have also telegraphs and,

00:15:19.277 --> 00:15:24.152
where we don’t use any wires.

00:15:24.734 --> 00:15:27.734
So without any connection through the ether,

00:15:27.943 --> 00:15:29.110
He can manage.

00:15:29.318 --> 00:15:35.734
So all the ethereal connections has been done

00:15:35.985 --> 00:15:38.860
by this great engineer, Shri Hanumana.

00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:42.609
And it is so perfect, it’s so perfect

00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:45.068
that you cannot challenge it,

00:15:45.318 --> 00:15:46.860
and you cannot find faults with it.

00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.484
Maybe your instruments may not be all right,

00:15:49.818 --> 00:15:53.193
but as far as His ethereal work is concerned,

00:15:53.442 --> 00:15:54.985
He’s perfectly there.

00:15:55.318 --> 00:15:58.193
Now the scientists discover it and think that

00:15:58.402 --> 00:16:03.985
it is in the nature, but they never think, how can it be?

00:16:04.402 --> 00:16:06.318
We say something in the ether

00:16:06.526 --> 00:16:09.484
and how is it, it is received on the other end?

00:16:09.734 --> 00:16:12.443
They just take it for granted that it is so, that

00:16:12.609 --> 00:16:16.526
we say something here or we relay something

00:16:16.860 --> 00:16:20.318
on the television and it is seen the other side.

00:16:20.443 --> 00:16:25.734
But they never even think or search out how it is done,

00:16:26.068 --> 00:16:27.026
what is the way.

00:16:27.318 --> 00:16:32.318
And this is what is the work of Shri Hanumana,

00:16:32.526 --> 00:16:39.526
who has done such a beautiful network,

00:16:40.068 --> 00:16:43.860
and through that network all these things work out.

00:16:44.318 --> 00:16:47.734
So even on the right side

00:16:48.235 --> 00:16:54.901
the vibrations we get in the molecules,

00:16:56.318 --> 00:16:59.609
as you know that we get molecules like sulfur dioxide,

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.068
if you have the sulfur, has two oxygen,

00:17:02.235 --> 00:17:06.651
and the oxygen goes on pulsating like that.

00:17:06.901 --> 00:17:09.360
They are asymmetric, symmetric type of vibrations,

00:17:09.526 --> 00:17:10.985
you all must be knowing about it.

00:17:11.235 --> 00:17:14.360
So all these things, symmetric and asymmetric vibrations

00:17:14.651 --> 00:17:17.443
are created by whom? Nobody wants to know,

00:17:17.734 --> 00:17:18.985
nobody wants to find out,

00:17:19.193 --> 00:17:20.901
because after all in an atom or...

00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:25.734
So imagine, in a molecule, that deep, who does that job?

00:17:25.985 --> 00:17:30.110
It’s done by Shri Hanuman, in His subtle ways.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.443
So He has another great,

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:40.193
great siddhi which we call as anima.

00:17:40.484 --> 00:17:43.860
Anima, anu – “anu” means a molecule,

00:17:44.402 --> 00:17:47.068
and that means it can enter into a molecule,

00:17:47.277 --> 00:17:51.277
or “renu” is the atom.

00:17:51.484 --> 00:17:54.277
It can enter into molecule or into atom.

00:17:54.402 --> 00:17:55.985
Now, many scientists think that they have,

00:17:56.193 --> 00:17:58.693
in the modern times they discovered the molecules.

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:03.193
It’s not so, because it’s already in our oldest scriptures,

00:18:03.442 --> 00:18:07.860
description of anima is there, is of anu, renu is there,

00:18:08.068 --> 00:18:10.818
so is already described there.

00:18:11.402 --> 00:18:16.318
Now, then whatever, wherever you see

00:18:16.818 --> 00:18:20.693
the electromagnetic forces working,

00:18:20.860 --> 00:18:24.818
it is worked through Hanumana’s blessings.

00:18:25.068 --> 00:18:29.943
He is the one who creates electromagnetic forces.

00:18:30.277 --> 00:18:34.068
So now we can see that as Ganesha

00:18:34.318 --> 00:18:37.734
has got the magnetic force in Him – He’s the magnet,

00:18:38.068 --> 00:18:40.442
He’s the, He has got the magnetic force

00:18:40.818 --> 00:18:44.693
– then we can say the electromagnetic is,

00:18:45.693 --> 00:18:49.526
is the one which we call as Hanumana’s force,

00:18:49.818 --> 00:18:51.818
on the material side of it.

00:18:52.277 --> 00:18:59.068
But from the matter He goes up to the brain.

00:18:59.318 --> 00:19:05.442
So He rises from Swadisthana up to the brain,

00:19:05.693 --> 00:19:12.526
so in the brain also He creates the co-relationships

00:19:12.985 --> 00:19:18.152
of the different sides of our brain.

00:19:18.484 --> 00:19:20.277
So how much He gives us.

00:19:20.442 --> 00:19:25.609
I mean, we can say if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:29.193
then He gives us the power to think.

00:19:29.484 --> 00:19:33.985
He protects us also, that we should not think of bad things.

00:19:34.277 --> 00:19:36.277
That is, we can say that,

00:19:36.484 --> 00:19:41.484
that if Ganesha gives us the wisdom,

00:19:41.943 --> 00:19:47.818
then Shri Hanumana gives us the conscience.

00:19:49.193 --> 00:19:51.943
I hope you understand the difference between the two.

00:19:52.193 --> 00:19:55.943
Wisdom is where you do not need conscience so much

00:19:56.193 --> 00:19:58.985
because you are wise, you know what is good, what is bad.

00:19:59.277 --> 00:20:01.818
But conscience is needed in a personality

00:20:02.193 --> 00:20:05.277
where he is to be controlled,

00:20:05.484 --> 00:20:09.860
and that control comes from Shri Hanumana,

00:20:10.152 --> 00:20:12.484
which is the conscience in the human being.

00:20:13.193 --> 00:20:15.734
Now this conscience which is Shri Hanumana

00:20:15.943 --> 00:20:21.860
is the subtle form of Him which gives us

00:20:22.152 --> 00:20:24.734
– is in Sanskrit called as “satasat vivekabuddhi”:

00:20:24.943 --> 00:20:28.277
means, “sat” means truth,

00:20:28.568 --> 00:20:30.734
“asat” means untruth,

00:20:30.985 --> 00:20:34.193
and “viveka” means the discrimination,

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:38.277
and “buddhi” means the intelligence.

00:20:38.484 --> 00:20:44.609
So, intelligence to discriminate between

00:20:44.943 --> 00:20:51.277
the truth and untruth is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

00:20:52.651 --> 00:20:55.235
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

00:20:56.651 --> 00:21:01.651
if we say that Ganesha is the one who gives us,

00:21:01.985 --> 00:21:03.193
He’s the adhyaksha,

00:21:03.442 --> 00:21:05.318
means He is the – I call Him

00:21:05.443 --> 00:21:07.776
as the chancellor of the university.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:10.443
He is the one who goes on degree to us,

00:21:10.734 --> 00:21:15.235
“Now you have crossed this chakra, that chakra, that chakra.”

00:21:15.985 --> 00:21:22.443
And He helps us to know that what state we are in.

00:21:23.442 --> 00:21:25.609
So the Ganesha gives us, say,

00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:27.318
nirvichara samadhi

00:21:27.526 --> 00:21:30.526
which we can call it as the thoughtless awareness,

00:21:30.734 --> 00:21:32.526
and nirvikalpa samadhi.

00:21:32.985 --> 00:21:36.776
He gives all that, and also He gives us joy.

00:21:38.442 --> 00:21:50.776
But the understanding that this is good,

00:21:51.526 --> 00:21:54.110
this is for our benevolence,

00:21:55.985 --> 00:22:02.442
mental understanding, comes to us from Shri Hanumana.

00:22:02.734 --> 00:22:06.651
And it’s very important for Western people

00:22:06.901 --> 00:22:08.526
because it has to be mental,

00:22:08.776 --> 00:22:10.860
otherwise they won’t understand.

00:22:11.442 --> 00:22:14.443
If it is not mental they cannot come into abstract.

00:22:14.776 --> 00:22:15.985
It has to be mental.

00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:21.318
And so the mental understanding of whether it is good or bad

00:22:21.609 --> 00:22:24.360
is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

00:22:24.609 --> 00:22:29.318
Without Him, even if you become a saint

00:22:29.734 --> 00:22:32.443
you will be – of course, you are a saint

00:22:32.734 --> 00:22:35.360
and you will enjoy the saintliness;

00:22:35.651 --> 00:22:39.985
but whether this saintliness is

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.526
all right if you live on Himalayas,

00:22:42.734 --> 00:22:46.609
or is all right when you go across to people

00:22:46.776 --> 00:22:49.734
to give them realization – all this scanning,

00:22:49.985 --> 00:22:52.360
this vivekabuddhi, all this scanning,

00:22:52.526 --> 00:22:56.526
all this discrimination, all this guidance,

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:01.360
all this protection is given to us by Shri Hanumana.

00:23:02.442 --> 00:23:05.484
Germany being a country which is very, very much,

00:23:05.651 --> 00:23:08.318
I should say, an essence of right side;

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:12.651
and because of it being such an essence of right side,

00:23:12.860 --> 00:23:16.734
is important to get the protector of right side

00:23:17.442 --> 00:23:19.443
here worshipped.

00:23:19.985 --> 00:23:24.110
But in all that vivekabuddhi,

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:27.443
in that discrimination He knows one thing,

00:23:27.860 --> 00:23:32.443
that He’s absolutely subservient to Shri Rama.

00:23:33.026 --> 00:23:34.442
Now what is Shri Rama?

00:23:34.568 --> 00:23:36.734
Shri Rama is the benevolent king,

00:23:36.901 --> 00:23:39.110
He works for the benevolence.

00:23:39.442 --> 00:23:44.110
And Shri Rama Himself is a formal king,

00:23:44.318 --> 00:23:45.651
like sankocha, we call it – I mean,

00:23:45.776 --> 00:23:47.985
the English words are not so good to explain this,

00:23:48.193 --> 00:23:52.318
but Shri Rama is the one who is,

00:23:53.609 --> 00:23:55.734
who will not push forward Himself.

00:23:56.318 --> 00:23:58.860
He keeps back. He’s very balanced,

00:23:59.026 --> 00:24:01.651
He is a very poised person.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:04.526
So the Hanumana, you see,

00:24:04.860 --> 00:24:09.235
He, He is the one who is always anxious

00:24:09.443 --> 00:24:11.609
to do the work of Shri Rama, always.

00:24:11.901 --> 00:24:14.651
If Shri Rama says, “All right, you go and get the...”

00:24:14.985 --> 00:24:18.901
He told Him, “go and get the...” – sanjeevani

00:24:19.152 --> 00:24:23.026
is the kind of a herb that was needed

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:26.110
to bring Lakshmana to life

00:24:26.442 --> 00:24:29.985
– He went there and He brought the whole mountain with Him,

00:24:30.152 --> 00:24:32.901
“Now, better have it.” It’s like that sort of a person,

00:24:33.235 --> 00:24:36.776
you see, so He brought the – that’s childlike behavior of His.

00:24:37.026 --> 00:24:42.360
And the discrimination in this is that,

00:24:42.651 --> 00:24:44.776
that “If Shri Rama has asked for,

00:24:44.985 --> 00:24:46.776
whatever He asks for, I’ll do it.”

00:24:47.026 --> 00:24:50.360
So is a relationship of a, I would say,

00:24:50.651 --> 00:24:52.526
like a guru and [*]shishya.

00:24:52.776 --> 00:24:55.443
But even more than that, that the shishya

00:24:55.776 --> 00:24:59.693
is just like a subservient servant,

00:24:59.901 --> 00:25:03.026
absolutely surrendered to God,

00:25:05.442 --> 00:25:07.526
absolutely surrendered to God,

00:25:07.776 --> 00:25:09.985
and His main thing is surrender.

00:25:10.235 --> 00:25:13.985
Now see, this surrender itself

00:25:14.568 --> 00:25:17.651
shows that all those who are right-sided people

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.901
are surrendered to God, not surrendered to their bosses.

00:25:23.152 --> 00:25:25.026
Mostly all those right-sided people

00:25:25.235 --> 00:25:26.776
are very surrendered to their bosses,

00:25:27.026 --> 00:25:28.985
surrendered to their jobs,

00:25:29.277 --> 00:25:31.693
sometimes surrendered to their wives also.

00:25:32.235 --> 00:25:35.901
But they are subservient to wrong people,

00:25:36.152 --> 00:25:38.277
they have no discretion.

00:25:38.693 --> 00:25:41.110
You’ll always find that, they have no discretion.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:44.152
But if you take the help of Hanumana,

00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:46.901
then He tells you that you have to be

00:25:47.152 --> 00:25:50.526
surrendered to God Almighty and not to anybody else,

00:25:50.693 --> 00:25:53.026
or to your Guru like Rama.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:56.443
Otherwise you are not to be surrendered to anybody else.

00:25:56.776 --> 00:25:58.526
And then you are a free bird,

00:25:58.693 --> 00:26:02.152
and you have all the nine powers within yourself.

00:26:02.442 --> 00:26:10.443
Hanumana’s whole thing is to antidote your overactivity,

00:26:10.693 --> 00:26:15.568
to antidote your too-much thinking,

00:26:15.901 --> 00:26:18.318
to antidote your ego.

00:26:18.568 --> 00:26:22.901
Now, how He finishes the ego of people

00:26:23.110 --> 00:26:27.443
is very sweetly shown when He burnt the whole of Lanka

00:26:27.776 --> 00:26:34.776
– is the capital of Ravana

00:26:35.443 --> 00:26:37.526
– and the way He made fun of him.

00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:41.360
Because you see, anybody who is egoistical,

00:26:41.693 --> 00:26:44.693
one must make fun of him, then he’s all right.

00:26:44.985 --> 00:26:50.110
Like first He went and when Ravana saw Him,

00:26:50.235 --> 00:26:53.526
he said, “Who are You? Who are You, the monkey?”

00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:57.152
So He just pushed His tail towards him,

00:26:57.443 --> 00:27:00.860
and tickled his nose with His tail.

00:27:03.693 --> 00:27:08.693
So He’s the one who makes fun of egoistical people.

00:27:08.985 --> 00:27:11.360
Now, if somebody egoistical tries to trouble you,

00:27:11.651 --> 00:27:14.651
He’s the one; He’ll make such fun out of him

00:27:14.901 --> 00:27:17.442
that you’ll be amazed how this fellow was jumping,

00:27:17.568 --> 00:27:19.442
like a Humpty-Dumpty has fallen down

00:27:19.651 --> 00:27:20.693
and has broken his crown.

00:27:20.985 --> 00:27:23.901
So you see, it is the job of Hanumana

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:27.860
to protect you from egoistical people.

00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:30.651
And also He protects the egoistical people

00:27:30.985 --> 00:27:35.442
by showing them down – like, say, Saddam.

00:27:35.734 --> 00:27:39.484
In the case of Saddam I just asked Hanumana to do the job,

00:27:39.734 --> 00:27:41.193
because I know He’ll do it.

00:27:41.484 --> 00:27:44.818
Now, how He has put this Saddam

00:27:45.068 --> 00:27:47.152
into different circumstances,

00:27:47.443 --> 00:27:49.734
that he doesn’t know what to do,

00:27:50.026 --> 00:27:52.360
he doesn’t know how to go.

00:27:52.443 --> 00:27:55.568
Because supposing he says, “All right, I’ll have war”;

00:27:55.901 --> 00:27:58.818
so the whole of Iraq will be finished,

00:27:59.277 --> 00:28:00.277
he’ll be finished,

00:28:00.443 --> 00:28:03.360
Kuwait will be finished, all petrol will be finished, all right.

00:28:03.568 --> 00:28:04.943
Everybody will be in trouble.

00:28:05.193 --> 00:28:08.026
But what about him? – he won’t be there, too.

00:28:08.443 --> 00:28:10.193
Because if the Americans have to fight,

00:28:10.402 --> 00:28:12.443
they will go in his place and fight.

00:28:12.734 --> 00:28:14.068
They won’t fight in America,

00:28:14.318 --> 00:28:16.277
he’s not going to go to America to fight them.

00:28:16.402 --> 00:28:17.734
Few Americans may be dead.

00:28:18.152 --> 00:28:21.943
So now, in this Saddam’s brain

00:28:22.152 --> 00:28:24.068
also Hanumana is working and telling him,

00:28:24.277 --> 00:28:29.693
“Now see, Mister, if you do like this, then this will happen.”

00:28:32.776 --> 00:28:35.152
He works into the brains of all the politicians,

00:28:35.443 --> 00:28:37.360
all these egoistical people.

00:28:37.776 --> 00:28:41.776
And then, then they get sometimes stunned,

00:28:42.026 --> 00:28:43.693
sometimes they change their policies,

00:28:43.943 --> 00:28:47.943
they come round and that’s how they manage.

00:28:48.235 --> 00:28:53.943
Also another great quality of Hanumana is that He makes,

00:28:54.609 --> 00:28:59.568
makes people – sort of an arbitrator He is

00:28:59.901 --> 00:29:02.484
– He makes people meet each other.

00:29:03.152 --> 00:29:05.068
And two egoistical people,

00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:06.568
He will make them meet,

00:29:06.776 --> 00:29:08.818
and then He’ll create such situation

00:29:09.068 --> 00:29:11.776
that they both become friends and become mild.

00:29:12.026 --> 00:29:19.235
So His whole character within us acts us to see our ego,

00:29:19.568 --> 00:29:23.360
discriminate that “Oh, this is my ego that is working,”

00:29:23.484 --> 00:29:29.068
and then to become childlike and sweet,

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.901
mirthful and happy.

00:29:31.152 --> 00:29:32.776
He’s always in a dancing mood,

00:29:33.026 --> 00:29:34.568
all the time He’s dancing,

00:29:34.776 --> 00:29:38.277
and before Rama He’s always bowed down,

00:29:38.609 --> 00:29:43.943
and always wants to do whatever is the desire of Shri Ram.

00:29:44.277 --> 00:29:47.235
So if Ganesha stands behind Me,

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.609
Hanumana stands here at My feet,

00:29:49.943 --> 00:29:51.068
and He’s there.

00:29:51.402 --> 00:29:55.693
In the same way I would say, if Germany – as Philip,

00:29:55.943 --> 00:30:00.277
he has asked Me that if

00:30:00.776 --> 00:30:03.609
Germany can become like Hanumana

00:30:04.152 --> 00:30:06.152
– then what a dynamic force we have,

00:30:06.568 --> 00:30:08.818
if they become so subservient.

00:30:09.277 --> 00:30:14.068
And the subservient nature of Hanumana

00:30:14.484 --> 00:30:16.360
is seen to such an extent that,

00:30:16.818 --> 00:30:18.402
as you know the story of Sita

00:30:18.651 --> 00:30:21.277
when She gave a necklace to Him

00:30:21.484 --> 00:30:25.402
and He wouldn’t wear it, because inside there was no Ram.

00:30:26.360 --> 00:30:29.860
Once, Sita felt that all the time He is around,

00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:34.901
and so He’s sort of cutting out Her privacy.

00:30:35.235 --> 00:30:40.235
So She said, “Now, You can be there only for one work.

00:30:40.443 --> 00:30:41.901
You need not to do every work.”

00:30:42.026 --> 00:30:43.443
He used to do every work of Shri Rama.

00:30:43.734 --> 00:30:45.568
She said, “For one work You should be there.

00:30:45.776 --> 00:30:47.026
Choose whichever work You want to do.”

00:30:47.235 --> 00:30:52.442
He said, “Only, you see, I would like to be with Shri Ram,

00:30:52.568 --> 00:30:55.860
that whenever He sneezes I should do like this.”

00:30:56.026 --> 00:30:57.318
You see, in India when we sneeze,

00:30:57.443 --> 00:30:58.651
we have to do like this with this;

00:30:58.901 --> 00:31:01.152
because the sneezing is, you see, avoids,

00:31:01.442 --> 00:31:05.443
to avoid all the negativity to go out.

00:31:05.651 --> 00:31:07.318
So we do like this if you sneeze.

00:31:07.651 --> 00:31:13.651
Or if you feel sleepy

00:31:15.026 --> 00:31:19.235
and you yawn, then also we do like that, mostly.

00:31:19.484 --> 00:31:24.068
So He said, “Whenever He’ll yawn, You allow Me just to...”

00:31:24.442 --> 00:31:25.526
– this we call as chutki,

00:31:25.734 --> 00:31:28.110
I don’t know what you call this, chutki –

00:31:28.318 --> 00:31:30.110
“allow Me to do this.”

00:31:30.609 --> 00:31:32.734
Sita said, “This is something very little work,

00:31:32.943 --> 00:31:34.943
you see, this fellow then will be out of sight.”

00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.484
So He stood there.

00:31:36.943 --> 00:31:38.860
So She said, “Now, why are You standing here?”

00:31:39.068 --> 00:31:41.235
“I am waiting for that.

00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:47.985
So how can I go?”

00:31:48.609 --> 00:31:51.484
And that’s how – She granted, first She granted,

00:31:51.651 --> 00:31:52.943
“All right, given to You this job,”

00:31:53.193 --> 00:31:55.943
now She can’t take it back because She’s granted this job.

00:31:56.110 --> 00:31:59.818
So He’s always there like this standing,

00:31:59.985 --> 00:32:02.402
just to do this to Shri Ram.

00:32:02.609 --> 00:32:05.068
So I mean, the sweetness of the whole thing

00:32:05.318 --> 00:32:10.651
is that every time, every minute He is subservient,

00:32:10.985 --> 00:32:13.943
He’s attentive, He’s there.

00:32:14.651 --> 00:32:19.068
Also in Sahaja Yoga

00:32:21.068 --> 00:32:27.442
I have relationships with you as a Guru, as a Mother

00:32:32.484 --> 00:32:34.818
and, I don’t know, unlimited.

00:32:35.068 --> 00:32:38.110
But still these two relationships we know of,

00:32:38.318 --> 00:32:40.609
that I’m your Mother and I’m your Guru.

00:32:40.943 --> 00:32:43.734
Now My – as a Guru,

00:32:44.068 --> 00:32:47.193
My main concern is that

00:32:47.609 --> 00:32:50.526
you should learn all about Sahaja Yog,

00:32:50.943 --> 00:32:54.318
you should become experts of Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:54.484 --> 00:32:57.068
and you should become yourself the gurus.

00:32:57.277 --> 00:32:59.235
It’s the only concern I have.

00:32:59.484 --> 00:33:02.068
But for that, complete surrender is required.

00:33:02.318 --> 00:33:03.985
“Islam” means surrender.

00:33:04.318 --> 00:33:05.609
So you have to surrender.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:07.277
If you are surrendered,

00:33:07.484 --> 00:33:10.526
then only you can learn what is the,

00:33:10.818 --> 00:33:17.526
what is the way you will handle Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:17.818 --> 00:33:20.402
Now, even this surrendering

00:33:20.734 --> 00:33:23.110
is done by Shri Hanumana.

00:33:23.443 --> 00:33:26.568
He’s the one who teaches you how to surrender now

00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:28.985
or makes you surrender,

00:33:29.360 --> 00:33:32.235
because egoistical people don’t surrender.

00:33:32.442 --> 00:33:36.318
Then He puts some sort of hurdles

00:33:36.443 --> 00:33:40.318
or some sort of miracles or some tricks,

00:33:40.776 --> 00:33:48.443
by which then a disciple surrenders himself to the Guru.

00:33:48.776 --> 00:33:50.235
Otherwise he’s not surrendered,

00:33:50.443 --> 00:33:52.442
he finds it difficult to surrender,

00:33:52.776 --> 00:33:59.235
and the force that acts to make him surrender to the Guru

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:02.026
is also that of Hanumana.

00:34:03.776 --> 00:34:05.901
So not that He is only surrendered,

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.860
but He makes others also to be surrendered.

00:34:09.026 --> 00:34:11.985
Because only the – because of ego you cannot surrender,

00:34:12.442 --> 00:34:15.235
so He’s the one who fights your ego,

00:34:15.568 --> 00:34:20.360
and He puts it down and makes you surrender.

00:34:20.776 --> 00:34:23.651
So in His own expression,

00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:30.442
I would say that what He has shown that

00:34:31.152 --> 00:34:35.901
there’s a very beautiful area of right side.

00:34:36.152 --> 00:34:40.360
If it is to be perfectly enjoyed

00:34:40.568 --> 00:34:44.651
then you should be completely surrendered to your Guru,

00:34:45.693 --> 00:34:48.443
as if you are the servant of that Guru.

00:34:48.609 --> 00:34:53.484
Whatever you have to do for that Guru,

00:34:53.651 --> 00:34:54.651
you have to do it.

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:56.651
Of course, you must know that your Guru

00:34:56.860 --> 00:34:59.193
has to give you realization, minimum,

00:34:59.402 --> 00:35:01.402
otherwise that’s not a guru.

00:35:01.651 --> 00:35:04.609
But anybody who has given you the realization,

00:35:04.943 --> 00:35:06.943
you have to be so surrendered

00:35:07.193 --> 00:35:09.442
that you should be just like a servant,

00:35:09.609 --> 00:35:11.402
not to feel shy about it.

00:35:11.609 --> 00:35:12.985
Like I would now sometimes,

00:35:13.193 --> 00:35:15.068
you know, I am going by, say,

00:35:15.277 --> 00:35:18.110
I’m going by aeroplane,

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:22.818
and sometimes I cannot wear My shoes

00:35:22.985 --> 00:35:25.193
because they’re so swollen up.

00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:28.068
So normally I would take the shoes in My hands

00:35:28.277 --> 00:35:29.651
and walk about.

00:35:29.818 --> 00:35:31.442
But I have seen Sahaja yogis,

00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:33.609
they pick up My shoes also and walk with it,

00:35:33.985 --> 00:35:35.985
and they don’t feel shy about it.

00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:39.402
They just feel so proud that they are carrying My shoes.

00:35:39.943 --> 00:35:41.318
So there is not

00:35:41.484 --> 00:35:44.860
– one should feel proud that you are doing all these things,

00:35:45.068 --> 00:35:48.609
that you have a chance to do all these things for your Guru,

00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:52.193
and that you are surrendering to that Guru;

00:35:52.318 --> 00:35:55.110
you are absolutely only bothered

00:35:55.318 --> 00:35:57.402
as to how you can serve the Guru,

00:35:57.526 --> 00:35:59.110
how you can please the Guru,

00:35:59.442 --> 00:36:03.318
and how you could be closer to that Guru.

00:36:03.651 --> 00:36:06.193
It doesn’t mean physical closeness

00:36:06.402 --> 00:36:10.609
but a kind of a rapport, a kind of an understanding.

00:36:10.860 --> 00:36:14.484
Even those who are away from Me can feel Me in their heart.

00:36:14.818 --> 00:36:16.651
And this is what it is, that

00:36:16.943 --> 00:36:23.442
we have to get this power from Shri Hanumana.

00:36:23.943 --> 00:36:28.402
Now, He’s the one who protects also all the deities.

00:36:28.609 --> 00:36:30.818
He protects. Now, there’s a difference

00:36:31.110 --> 00:36:34.068
between Shri Ganesha and Him.

00:36:34.318 --> 00:36:39.235
The Shri Ganesha gives energy shakti,

00:36:39.609 --> 00:36:42.442
but the one who protects is Shri Hanumana.

00:36:42.734 --> 00:36:45.402
So you’ll find that when Shri Krishna

00:36:45.526 --> 00:36:48.860
was the chariot of Arjuna,

00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:53.318
then on top of the chariot was sitting Hanumana,

00:36:53.484 --> 00:36:55.068
not Shri Ganesh.

00:36:55.402 --> 00:36:58.734
Hanumana was sitting there looking after Him.

00:37:00.068 --> 00:37:04.526
Also in a way that Shri Rama Himself becomes Shri Vishnu,

00:37:04.734 --> 00:37:07.193
so He has to look after Him.

00:37:08.734 --> 00:37:10.484
He is an angel, as you know:

00:37:10.734 --> 00:37:14.985
according to Christian, we should say according to Bible,

00:37:15.402 --> 00:37:18.526
that He is the angel called Gabriel.

00:37:20.734 --> 00:37:24.484
Now Gabriel is the one who brought the message,

00:37:24.734 --> 00:37:28.985
because He’s always a messenger, to Maria,

00:37:29.318 --> 00:37:32.609
and it’s surprisingly the words He used were

00:37:32.818 --> 00:37:37.651
“Immaculata Salve” – that’s My name.

00:37:37.943 --> 00:37:39.318
My first name is Nirmala,

00:37:39.526 --> 00:37:41.818
means “Immaculata” and surname is Salve.

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.943
He said those words to Her.

00:37:44.318 --> 00:37:46.985
And today also I was surprised

00:37:47.484 --> 00:37:50.943
when it came to giving Me a present,

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:54.985
they found a tea-set and dinner-set

00:37:55.318 --> 00:37:57.193
which is called as “Maria.”

00:37:57.484 --> 00:38:02.193
So Maria has to do quite a lot with Hanumana all Her life.

00:38:02.484 --> 00:38:05.068
That means Maria is the Mahalakshmi.

00:38:05.318 --> 00:38:10.068
Mahalakshmi being the Sita, Sita then Radha,

00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:13.484
Hanumana has to be there to serve Her.

00:38:13.818 --> 00:38:17.235
And that is why, you see, sometimes

00:38:17.651 --> 00:38:20.860
people say, “Mother, how did You know?

00:38:21.110 --> 00:38:23.193
Mother, how did You come to know?

00:38:23.609 --> 00:38:27.110
Mother, how did You send a message?

00:38:27.442 --> 00:38:30.110
Mother, how did You work it out?” Can you imagine?

00:38:30.402 --> 00:38:34.651
This is Shri Hanumana’s headache, He does it.

00:38:34.985 --> 00:38:37.068
Anything passes through My mind,

00:38:37.235 --> 00:38:38.860
He just takes it up and it’s done.

00:38:39.110 --> 00:38:42.318
Because as I told you that His whole organization

00:38:42.526 --> 00:38:44.193
is so well planned;

00:38:44.442 --> 00:38:46.526
all these messages, from where do they get them?

00:38:46.734 --> 00:38:48.734
Many people say, “Mother, I just prayed to You.”

00:38:49.402 --> 00:38:51.068
There was a gentleman

00:38:51.318 --> 00:38:52.734
whose mother was very sick

00:38:53.068 --> 00:38:54.442
and he went to see her,

00:38:54.734 --> 00:38:58.484
and she was just going to die with cancer.

00:38:58.818 --> 00:39:00.402
So he said, “I didn’t know what to do,

00:39:00.526 --> 00:39:01.484
so I just prayed to You,

00:39:01.651 --> 00:39:03.484
"Mother, please save my mother.”

00:39:03.734 --> 00:39:06.442
Now the sincerity of that person,

00:39:06.818 --> 00:39:10.609
the depth of that person as a Sahaja yogi Hanumana knows.

00:39:10.943 --> 00:39:13.818
He knows what is the weight of this person is.

00:39:14.734 --> 00:39:16.734
And immediately, you’ll be surprised,

00:39:16.943 --> 00:39:20.402
within three days the woman who was going to die survived,

00:39:20.609 --> 00:39:21.526
she got all right.

00:39:21.734 --> 00:39:24.110
He brought her to Bombay and the doctor said,

00:39:24.277 --> 00:39:26.193
“She has no cancer.”

00:39:27.484 --> 00:39:29.318
Many things which you call miracles

00:39:29.609 --> 00:39:31.860
are done by Shri Hanuman.

00:39:32.402 --> 00:39:35.860
He’s the one who is the doer of miracles.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:41.402
He does miracles also to show how stupid you are,

00:39:43.110 --> 00:39:44.277
how foolish you are,

00:39:44.526 --> 00:39:47.442
because He is on the right side,

00:39:47.609 --> 00:39:49.442
see He goes to the ego side.

00:39:49.734 --> 00:39:52.277
Now with the ego a human being

00:39:52.442 --> 00:39:56.442
is always becomes stupid – that’s, I mean, inevitable.

00:39:56.734 --> 00:39:59.943
With ego they become so stupid, “Oh, what’s wrong?”

00:40:00.402 --> 00:40:02.110
And that’s why you will find

00:40:02.402 --> 00:40:03.943
many people doing such stupid things,

00:40:04.193 --> 00:40:05.484
we can’t understand why they do it.

00:40:05.818 --> 00:40:07.693
They say, “What’s wrong?”

00:40:07.943 --> 00:40:12.110
What’s wrong is that Hanumana doesn’t like it is the point,

00:40:12.402 --> 00:40:15.484
and then it recoils.

00:40:15.985 --> 00:40:18.402
When they act stupidly it recoils

00:40:18.526 --> 00:40:22.402
and then they know that we have done such a big mistake,

00:40:22.609 --> 00:40:24.442
or it was all stupid.

00:40:24.734 --> 00:40:28.693
But sometimes it could be extremely, extremely

00:40:29.609 --> 00:40:32.734
difficult to retrace back;

00:40:32.985 --> 00:40:37.402
like the diseases, as I call it the yuppies disease,

00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:38.860
which is now impossible

00:40:39.068 --> 00:40:40.860
because Hanumana has taken away

00:40:41.068 --> 00:40:42.277
the electromagnetic force

00:40:42.442 --> 00:40:44.484
from these people and it doesn’t work,

00:40:44.734 --> 00:40:46.402
it doesn’t relate to your conscious mind.

00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:49.277
So your conscious mind cannot act, it just goes off.

00:40:49.693 --> 00:40:52.402
Only these people, if they worship Hanumana

00:40:52.693 --> 00:40:56.985
with the same devotion, then maybe they might be saved.

00:40:57.318 --> 00:40:59.985
But it’s not a easy thing to convince these stupid yuppies,

00:41:00.277 --> 00:41:01.442
you see, about anything.

00:41:01.651 --> 00:41:03.860
They say, “We don’t believe. So what?”

00:41:04.068 --> 00:41:05.609
So what, you die – what else?

00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:10.943
That’s the only limit, that’s the only life left for you,

00:41:11.110 --> 00:41:12.860
and you do that.

00:41:14.110 --> 00:41:16.484
There are so many aspects of Hanumana

00:41:16.734 --> 00:41:19.484
which I could have told you;

00:41:19.818 --> 00:41:23.526
but for example, for His body,

00:41:23.818 --> 00:41:27.068
you see, like Shiva is covered with the gheru.

00:41:27.277 --> 00:41:29.818
What you call gheru is a,

00:41:30.484 --> 00:41:32.693
that’s a kind of a, you know that gheru is,

00:41:32.943 --> 00:41:38.484
it’s a red-colored stone which is very, very, it is very hot.

00:41:38.734 --> 00:41:41.526
And supposing with the cold

00:41:41.818 --> 00:41:45.442
sometimes you develop those rashes,

00:41:45.693 --> 00:41:48.402
so if you put gheru those rashes are corrected.

00:41:48.609 --> 00:41:50.943
Or you get, due to badha sometimes,

00:41:51.193 --> 00:41:54.402
some sort of skin-diseases which are cured with gheru;

00:41:54.609 --> 00:41:57.068
because it is the one which is very hot,

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.651
and it soothes you down.

00:41:58.901 --> 00:42:01.235
On the contrary Shri Ganesha

00:42:01.443 --> 00:42:04.360
is covered with lead oxide,

00:42:04.568 --> 00:42:07.860
with the red lead oxide which is,

00:42:08.110 --> 00:42:11.693
which is extremely cold.

00:42:11.985 --> 00:42:14.693
Lead oxide is a very cold thing.

00:42:14.901 --> 00:42:17.443
If you touch lead, you see, it’s a very cold thing.

00:42:17.651 --> 00:42:21.651
So that lead oxide is used to cover all His body,

00:42:22.901 --> 00:42:28.026
is there to balance the heat that He has,

00:42:28.318 --> 00:42:30.360
or the effects of heat He has.

00:42:30.568 --> 00:42:35.152
So we call this in Sanskrit language is called as sindhura,

00:42:35.526 --> 00:42:38.152
and also in Marathi or Hindi called shindhura.

00:42:38.442 --> 00:42:41.693
So they must find always this is the color of that thing;

00:42:41.901 --> 00:42:47.901
so luckily I got this sari in Vienna,

00:42:48.152 --> 00:42:52.693
and I have it very nice for this occasion.

00:42:52.985 --> 00:42:56.235
So He’s always covered with that color,

00:42:56.526 --> 00:42:59.442
what you call this sindhur color.

00:43:00.235 --> 00:43:05.235
And lead oxide, though they say it causes cancer,

00:43:05.568 --> 00:43:08.360
people say that lead oxide can cause you cancer;

00:43:08.651 --> 00:43:11.901
but it is the lead oxide which is very cold,

00:43:12.152 --> 00:43:13.693
it can cool you down so much

00:43:13.985 --> 00:43:15.776
that you can go to the left side.

00:43:16.026 --> 00:43:18.152
And cancer is a psychosomatic disease,

00:43:18.443 --> 00:43:21.235
and that might be the reason it might cause,

00:43:21.443 --> 00:43:23.651
in a very far-fetched way we can say,

00:43:23.901 --> 00:43:26.110
can cause cancer to you.

00:43:26.318 --> 00:43:28.651
Because if it is too cold and all that

00:43:29.110 --> 00:43:30.901
and then you go to the left side,

00:43:31.235 --> 00:43:33.860
and the left side you can catch the viruses,

00:43:34.152 --> 00:43:36.693
by which you can get into troubles.

00:43:37.068 --> 00:43:41.110
So, but the same lead oxide is all right for people

00:43:41.402 --> 00:43:44.734
who are very right-sided.

00:43:44.985 --> 00:43:48.943
For them if it is put on their Agnya it cools them down,

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.402
they are cooled down.

00:43:50.651 --> 00:43:53.818
And it’s very good for them to put on their Agnya,

00:43:54.068 --> 00:43:55.318
so that they are cooled down.

00:43:55.526 --> 00:43:58.235
Their anger goes down, their temper goes down,

00:43:58.526 --> 00:44:00.442
and it’s a very good thing.

00:44:01.110 --> 00:44:03.442
So He’s the one who cures our anger,

00:44:03.651 --> 00:44:09.110
He’s the one who cures our hastiness,

00:44:09.526 --> 00:44:12.484
our speediness,

00:44:13.484 --> 00:44:15.235
our aggressiveness.

00:44:15.609 --> 00:44:17.402
He’s the one who does it.

00:44:17.609 --> 00:44:20.068
Now, He played a trick on Hitler. How?

00:44:20.318 --> 00:44:25.193
Hitler was using Shri Ganesha as a symbol,

00:44:25.442 --> 00:44:30.193
so this swastika was made in a clockwise manner.

00:44:30.609 --> 00:44:32.651
Then Hanumana played a trick on him.

00:44:33.110 --> 00:44:35.193
What He did, He made the

00:44:37.277 --> 00:44:42.193
stencil which they were using for making the,

00:44:43.985 --> 00:44:47.277
what you call the, making the swastika.

00:44:47.609 --> 00:44:52.152
He put it, somehow or other, lot of – I mean,

00:44:52.318 --> 00:44:54.860
He made it in such a way that they said,

00:44:54.985 --> 00:44:56.277
“We should use the other side.”

00:44:56.484 --> 00:45:00.442
As soon as they used the other side – it’s Hanumana’s trick;

00:45:00.860 --> 00:45:03.734
I suggested to Him, but I mean, He played the trick

00:45:04.152 --> 00:45:08.442
– they started using Ganesha from the other side.

00:45:08.609 --> 00:45:11.152
The same Ganesha about whom

00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:15.609
Shri Hanumana was worried how will He,

00:45:15.985 --> 00:45:18.068
how can He surpass Shri Ganesha,

00:45:18.318 --> 00:45:22.068
because He is the eldest, and how can you go beyond Him?

00:45:22.734 --> 00:45:26.235
And He is the deity, but Hanumana is an angel.

00:45:26.526 --> 00:45:29.860
So as soon as the trick was played,

00:45:30.110 --> 00:45:35.068
then both of them put together stopped Hitler from winning.

00:45:35.318 --> 00:45:37.651
This is how the trick was played.

00:45:37.901 --> 00:45:41.443
So all these little, little tricks, you see, are there.

00:45:41.776 --> 00:45:45.609
Once I remember I had My Puja in Germany;

00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:50.110
and Germany is the place where these tricks are played

00:45:50.443 --> 00:45:51.985
very much by Hanumana,

00:45:52.235 --> 00:45:54.860
because I have told you that they are the ones

00:45:55.110 --> 00:45:56.442
who require Him the most.

00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.484
So there was in Germany, there was a puja,

00:45:59.651 --> 00:46:03.360
and in the puja by mistake they put it the other way round

00:46:03.734 --> 00:46:05.068
– by mistake.

00:46:05.609 --> 00:46:08.609
I didn’t see. I, normally I always watch very carefully,

00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:10.985
but I don’t know why, that day I didn’t see it:

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:13.068
it must be also Hanumana’s trick.

00:46:13.318 --> 00:46:15.193
And when I saw, I said,

00:46:15.442 --> 00:46:18.360
“Oh God, where is it going to now hurt?

00:46:18.651 --> 00:46:20.442
Where is it going to work out?

00:46:20.776 --> 00:46:22.734
Which country it is going to hit?”

00:46:22.985 --> 00:46:29.110
It did not hit Germany, it hit England.

00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:32.442
Because England, I have worked so hard there

00:46:32.609 --> 00:46:35.110
and they have been so negligent about Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:35.318 --> 00:46:39.110
so lethargic about it, that it just went and hit there.

00:46:39.442 --> 00:46:44.651
So He is the one who goes like a torrential rain,

00:46:44.943 --> 00:46:47.443
or can go like a speedy, very speedy

00:46:49.193 --> 00:46:51.734
tempest and destroy things.

00:46:51.943 --> 00:46:53.734
So He works out all these things

00:46:53.985 --> 00:46:56.068
through His electromagnetic forces.

00:46:56.318 --> 00:47:01.193
So all the matter, all the matter

00:47:02.402 --> 00:47:03.734
is under His control.

00:47:03.985 --> 00:47:06.193
All the matter is under His control,

00:47:06.484 --> 00:47:09.860
and He’s the one who creates rain for you,

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:11.776
who creates sun for you,

00:47:12.068 --> 00:47:13.818
He creates breeze for you.

00:47:14.068 --> 00:47:16.484
He’s the one who does all these things

00:47:16.776 --> 00:47:19.484
just to have a proper puja,

00:47:19.734 --> 00:47:21.526
to have a proper meeting,

00:47:21.943 --> 00:47:24.442
everything He works out so beautifully.

00:47:24.651 --> 00:47:27.651
And nobody even knows that it is Shri Hanumana

00:47:27.818 --> 00:47:28.526
who has done it,

00:47:28.734 --> 00:47:32.402
and we should thank Shri Hanumana all the time.

00:47:33.026 --> 00:47:34.901
For the today’s thing, I mean, there are

00:47:35.235 --> 00:47:38.443
– I, if I have to talk about Him I’ll take hours together.

00:47:38.901 --> 00:47:43.318
But only thing I have to say that it’s a,

00:47:43.526 --> 00:47:47.651
such a blessing, I feel, that we have this in this palace,

00:47:48.026 --> 00:47:50.318
Shri Hanumana’s Puja.

00:47:50.443 --> 00:48:01.360
Because He was always a very majestic deity or a angel,

00:48:01.776 --> 00:48:06.734
and that in a place where it is so majestic

00:48:07.026 --> 00:48:09.360
and beautifully done, everything is there,

00:48:09.734 --> 00:48:11.318
and He would like that.

00:48:11.526 --> 00:48:15.734
He is not a sanyasi type of a person,

00:48:15.901 --> 00:48:16.860
He’s not an ascetic.

00:48:17.068 --> 00:48:19.277
Normally right-sided people are ascetic,

00:48:19.442 --> 00:48:23.318
they become..., they’ll make right-sided people,

00:48:23.609 --> 00:48:26.442
they’ll only have everything simple.

00:48:26.818 --> 00:48:29.152
They would like to shave off their nose also if possible,

00:48:29.443 --> 00:48:31.360
on the faces!

00:48:32.526 --> 00:48:36.026
So you see, the other way round, Hanumana is not doing.

00:48:36.318 --> 00:48:40.568
Hanumana likes beauty, He likes decorativeness,

00:48:41.026 --> 00:48:44.693
and He makes people non-ascetic,

00:48:44.985 --> 00:48:48.776
so Hanumana gives you this kind of a thing.

00:48:49.110 --> 00:48:51.693
But many people who are worshippers of Hanumana

00:48:52.026 --> 00:48:55.443
always say that those ladies should never go

00:48:55.651 --> 00:48:58.026
and take the darshan of Hanuman,

00:48:58.442 --> 00:49:00.776
because Hanumana is a brahmachari

00:49:01.318 --> 00:49:05.360
– is the one who is, who doesn’t want women to see him

00:49:05.860 --> 00:49:08.110
because he doesn’t wear full clothes

00:49:08.443 --> 00:49:11.026
– and He has very little clothes on Himself,

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:13.110
so He doesn’t want women to see Him.

00:49:13.443 --> 00:49:15.985
But if women think He is just a child,

00:49:16.152 --> 00:49:17.443
then it’s just the same.

00:49:17.776 --> 00:49:21.235
But this idea I think the people don’t have,

00:49:21.442 --> 00:49:22.443
that He’s a child.

00:49:22.860 --> 00:49:25.026
What is for a child how many clothes he wear

00:49:25.235 --> 00:49:25.901
or doesn’t wear?

00:49:26.026 --> 00:49:27.026
And then He’s a monkey,

00:49:27.235 --> 00:49:28.693
and the monkeys are not supposed to wear clothes.

00:49:28.985 --> 00:49:30.985
So whatever He wears is quite a lot,

00:49:31.152 --> 00:49:33.693
and it doesn’t give you even the feeling at all that

00:49:33.901 --> 00:49:35.901
He’s in any way nude or anything,

00:49:36.110 --> 00:49:38.568
but you just see such a sweet form of Him,

00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:40.152
such a sweet form.

00:49:41.318 --> 00:49:44.068
I wish sometimes you’d get His photograph also,

00:49:44.442 --> 00:49:49.235
as you have got the photographs of Shri Ganesha.

00:49:49.484 --> 00:49:51.526
Then you’ll really fall in love with Him,

00:49:51.818 --> 00:49:52.609
He’s such a sweet thing.

00:49:52.860 --> 00:49:55.402
And though He is so huge and so big

00:49:55.818 --> 00:49:58.609
and though He has nails,

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:02.318
but when He caresses My feet He pulls back His nails.

00:50:02.526 --> 00:50:05.734
He is so gentle, extremely gentle,

00:50:05.985 --> 00:50:08.943
and very beautifully He caresses My feet.

00:50:09.193 --> 00:50:12.318
And I have seen Him the way He handles everything,

00:50:12.526 --> 00:50:14.526
it’s extremely gentle ways.

00:50:14.818 --> 00:50:15.985
So that’s what I feel,

00:50:16.277 --> 00:50:18.193
that now Germans are becoming very gentle

00:50:18.402 --> 00:50:21.402
in handling things, in handling people.

00:50:21.651 --> 00:50:23.985
This change is coming, and I think

00:50:24.193 --> 00:50:26.442
is the blessing of Hanumana on them.

00:50:26.734 --> 00:50:29.818
So may God bless you.

00:50:34.901 --> 00:50:40.443
Now, so today we need not do Ganesh Puja,

00:50:40.776 --> 00:50:45.693
though a … once you can wash My feet with some song;

00:50:46.068 --> 00:50:47.818
because always before every puja

00:50:48.068 --> 00:50:52.402
one has to do Ganesha Puja, but need not be that elaborate.

00:51:28.398 --> 00:51:30.398
Just – where is Barbara?

00:51:30.572 --> 00:51:32.530
Ask her to get some hot water bottle,

00:51:32.689 --> 00:51:34.689
because Ganesha is cooling Me,

00:51:34.898 --> 00:51:37.940
the – and Hanumana is cooling Me down completely.

00:51:39.658 --> 00:51:40.658
It’s Hanumana, you see,

00:51:40.825 --> 00:51:43.033
is cooling Me down completely here from the back,

00:51:43.366 --> 00:51:46.817
and just now see how cool it’s becoming, the whole place,

00:51:47.135 --> 00:51:49.509
talking about Him.

02:56:47.781 --> 02:56:52.198
This is the present from Russia

02:56:52.656 --> 02:56:56.531
and here, see now, the color of Hanumana

02:56:56.781 --> 02:56:58.656
is exactly like My sari.

02:56:59.531 --> 02:57:02.531
And this is Hanumana, the Gabriel, just imagine:

02:57:02.781 --> 02:57:05.448
this is a Russian folk story,

02:57:05.740 --> 02:57:11.115
so Russians knew that He used to wear clothes of this color

02:57:11.406 --> 02:57:12.781
– just imagine.

02:57:13.198 --> 02:57:17.573
And He’s sitting on a horse,

02:57:18.240 --> 02:57:22.531
and also it is said that it is Gabriel

02:57:22.740 --> 02:57:28.990
who told Mohammed Sahib about the seven...

02:57:33.198 --> 02:57:36.990
He gave a horse to Mohammed Sahib

02:57:37.198 --> 02:57:42.614
to see to seven Heavens, you see, He gave.

02:57:43.573 --> 02:57:47.282
Yes, to see God Almighty on His greatness,

02:57:47.573 --> 02:57:48.906
that is the seven chakras,

02:57:49.240 --> 02:57:50.990
so Hanumana gave Him.

02:57:51.906 --> 02:57:53.448
It’s correct.

02:57:53.823 --> 02:57:56.157
Because Mohammed Sahib was on the left-hand side,

02:57:56.364 --> 02:58:00.323
He had a Chandra Ma; so He gave Him.

02:58:01.448 --> 02:58:03.823
So this is a beautiful piece.

02:58:04.531 --> 02:58:06.906
You should keep it there...

02:58:07.323 --> 02:58:11.781
But it’s made in Germany, made in Germany.
