00:07:28.388 --> 00:07:34.380
Talks to Brides and to Grooms.  Delhi (India), 23 March 2000.

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:39.505
Talk to Grooms.

00:07:39.806 --> 00:07:44.387
I am very happy to see you all here,

00:07:44.587 --> 00:07:47.610
and you should know you are

00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:51.272
going for a little different life,

00:07:51.473 --> 00:07:56.676
that you are getting married in Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:57.567 --> 00:08:00.289
Thereâ€™s a difference between

00:08:00.489 --> 00:08:03.976
the other marriages and Sahaja Yoga marriage

00:08:04.176 --> 00:08:10.468
in which we understand that marriage has to be

00:08:10.668 --> 00:08:16.292
a special, as they call yagnya,

00:08:16.492 --> 00:08:23.255
means a special type of a holy alliance

00:08:23.455 --> 00:08:32.935
in which you have to lead a very Sahaj life with your wife

00:08:33.135 --> 00:08:37.835
and to understand her. She is also Sahaja Yogini.

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:42.522
So you must respect her and you must love her,

00:08:42.722 --> 00:08:46.410
and she should really understand

00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:53.813
that you are her caring, loving, gentle husband.

00:08:54.013 --> 00:08:57.461
You must show all concern about her

00:08:57.661 --> 00:09:00.157
because she is a Sahaja Yogini.

00:09:00.357 --> 00:09:05.897
She is not an ordinary woman,
and with that respect I am sure

00:09:06.097 --> 00:09:12.354
youll be able to lead a very beautiful Sahaj married life.

00:09:12.554 --> 00:09:16.104
As it is, in Sahaja Yoga, as you know

00:09:16.304 --> 00:09:20.214
we dont criticize each other.

00:09:20.414 --> 00:09:24.604
We see the good points of another person

00:09:24.804 --> 00:09:28.963
and we have a great capacity to forgive.

00:09:29.163 --> 00:09:34.017
So to forgive is not to tolerate or to suffer,

00:09:34.217 --> 00:09:39.095
but you forgive just because you are very noble,

00:09:39.295 --> 00:09:41.564
you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:09:41.764 --> 00:09:47.141
So dont try to find faults with your wife all the time.

00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:50.672
Also you shouldnt give her all the time

00:09:50.872 --> 00:09:55.786
orders this, do this, do that - but join hands with her.

00:09:55.986 --> 00:09:59.075
Because in Sahaja Yoga we dont believe

00:09:59.275 --> 00:10:04.389
in an individuals rights as to dominate another person.

00:10:04.589 --> 00:10:09.210
So what you should see the need to help her,

00:10:09.410 --> 00:10:15.810
to understand her and to share all the problems.

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.615
Not to put problems on to her,

00:10:18.815 --> 00:10:24.553
but to give her all the helping hand that is needed.

00:10:24.753 --> 00:10:27.404
Shes your companion. Shes not your slave.

00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:29.748
Shes not your servant,

00:10:29.948 --> 00:10:34.741
neither you are sort of, I should say, a boss of her.

00:10:34.941 --> 00:10:40.038
So all those qualities are not to be seen in a Sahaja Yogi,

00:10:40.238 --> 00:10:42.772
and understanding is the best part.

00:10:42.972 --> 00:10:48.390
Try to understand her side also.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:52.507
Sometimes they are coming from another country

00:10:52.707 --> 00:10:56.453
and are of a different culture.

00:10:56.653 --> 00:11:00.764
So try to understand. This is how youll understand

00:11:00.964 --> 00:11:05.944
what is the culture of that country from where she comes.

00:11:06.144 --> 00:11:09.816
Also its good for children that you must always respect,

00:11:10.016 --> 00:11:13.176
always respect your wife.

00:11:13.376 --> 00:11:17.269
You shouldnt have some sort of a ideal about your wife.

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:21.803
And, forget about all the other conditionings you have had

00:11:22.003 --> 00:11:24.248
or you have seen in the society.

00:11:24.448 --> 00:11:26.522
You are a very different people.

00:11:26.722 --> 00:11:31.509
You are absolutely chosen people

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:34.978
for a very special work of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:35.178 --> 00:11:38.845
So once you start understanding this point

00:11:39.045 --> 00:11:45.764
that you are here to marry girls who are Sahaja Yoginis

00:11:45.964 --> 00:11:48.225
and who will look after you.

00:11:48.425 --> 00:11:51.250
I will also tell them what they have to do.

00:11:51.450 --> 00:11:56.219
But I would request you that do not have domination of a man

00:11:56.419 --> 00:11:58.570
or thinking that you are

00:11:58.770 --> 00:12:03.967
the head of the family to trouble the wife.

00:12:04.167 --> 00:12:07.404
Share with her. Please understand that

00:12:07.604 --> 00:12:10.951
and once you start doing that, you will enjoy

00:12:11.151 --> 00:12:14.154
helping her and understanding her.

00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:17.586
I hope your marriages are very, very successful

00:12:17.786 --> 00:12:21.040
and that you get very beautiful, sweet children

00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.578
who are born realized souls.

00:12:23.778 --> 00:12:27.557
I am sure you will have a very happy life ahead of you.

00:12:27.757 --> 00:12:34.596
So go for that, go for a happy life by making her happy,

00:12:34.796 --> 00:12:41.185
by making every one happy and looking
after everything in a Sahaj way.

00:12:41.385 --> 00:12:45.060
So may God bless you all.

00:12:45.260 --> 00:12:49.291
I am sorry, you have to wait...

00:14:25.714 --> 00:14:32.284
Talk to Brides

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:37.495
Very nice to see all of you so beautifully dressed

00:14:37.695 --> 00:14:41.938
and looking so nice.

00:14:43.248 --> 00:14:47.352
I want to tell you one thing,

00:14:47.552 --> 00:14:52.995
that you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga to Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:53.195 --> 00:14:55.932
Always remember this point.

00:14:56.132 --> 00:15:00.010
As it is, we see there are so many marriages breaking

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.256
and all kinds of things happening in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:04.456 --> 00:15:10.163
Also, we get sometimes one percent. Only one percent! Why?

00:15:10.363 --> 00:15:15.054
Because they understand the responsibility as Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:15.254 --> 00:15:19.046
So, I want all of you to remember

00:15:19.246 --> 00:15:23.570
that you are getting married to a Sahaja Yogi,

00:15:23.770 --> 00:15:27.445
and you must always remember this fact.

00:15:27.645 --> 00:15:30.101
You must respect him,

00:15:30.301 --> 00:15:34.994
you must look after him and care for him.

00:15:35.194 --> 00:15:40.533
Sometimes he may lose little bit of his balance.

00:15:40.733 --> 00:15:45.696
It is you who has to bring him back to balance

00:15:45.896 --> 00:15:50.289
with very gentle ways.

00:15:50.489 --> 00:16:00.450
It is your duty to preserve the society of Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:00.650 --> 00:16:05.064
People will come to your house. If they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:16:05.264 --> 00:16:09.923
their wives, their children, you must look after them

00:16:10.123 --> 00:16:15.975
because you are in charge of the society of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:16.175 --> 00:16:20.057
You may be earning a lot, you may be very well equipped,

00:16:20.269 --> 00:16:24.669
must be that, but you must always be humble

00:16:24.869 --> 00:16:28.583
and understand that

00:16:28.783 --> 00:16:33.349
you have to carry all the work of Sahaja Yoga

00:16:33.549 --> 00:16:36.044
through your marriage.

00:16:36.244 --> 00:16:39.021
This is a very big responsibility.

00:16:39.221 --> 00:16:44.911
In your case it is the preservation of the society

00:16:45.111 --> 00:16:50.098
that is of Sahaja Yoga people, their children.

00:16:50.298 --> 00:16:55.680
So you have to love all of them.

00:16:55.880 --> 00:16:58.130
You must care for them.

00:16:58.331 --> 00:17:04.932
Never think this is your own house and
that you are the queen of the house.

00:17:05.132 --> 00:17:11.354
But you are the mother, you are the sister,

00:17:11.554 --> 00:17:20.797
you are the complete relation of
these people who are Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:20.997 --> 00:17:23.320
So when they come to your house

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:26.294
you must show all respect and regard.

00:17:26.494 --> 00:17:31.231
Never complain about them to your husband. He wont like it.

00:17:31.431 --> 00:17:37.032
And also you must remember that your patience

00:17:37.232 --> 00:17:41.821
and your love and your guidance

00:17:42.021 --> 00:17:47.310
will definitely help to build your married life.

00:17:47.510 --> 00:17:49.802
If you want to be happy, you must know

00:17:50.002 --> 00:17:52.513
how to make others happy also.

00:17:52.713 --> 00:17:56.622
If you do not know how to make others happy,

00:17:56.822 --> 00:17:58.822
you can never be happy.

00:17:59.023 --> 00:18:02.153
So, you should not think about your own demands,

00:18:02.353 --> 00:18:05.697
your own needs,

00:18:05.898 --> 00:18:11.606
your own, you can say, ideas or anything.

00:18:11.806 --> 00:18:14.385
Whatever is there you have to do it

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:20.057
in a very gentle manner because you are the women,

00:18:20.258 --> 00:18:22.313
you are the ladies.

00:18:22.514 --> 00:18:27.383
So your style should be gentle, should not shout,

00:18:27.583 --> 00:18:30.649
you should not get angry,

00:18:30.849 --> 00:18:35.243
you should not treat anyone sharply.

00:18:35.443 --> 00:18:40.524
I will immediately know who is an unkind hostess.

00:18:40.724 --> 00:18:45.313
That people will tell Me that, Mother she is a funny woman,

00:18:45.513 --> 00:18:50.085
she doesnt know how to behave. So I dont want to hear that.

00:18:50.285 --> 00:18:56.176
I want to hear that you are very sweet, nice wives

00:18:56.376 --> 00:19:02.887
who will look after the husband, who will
look after the family of Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:03.087 --> 00:19:07.172
Thats your job. Theres nothing to feel degraded in that

00:19:07.372 --> 00:19:12.407
or less in that. Thats what is you have to do in Sahaja Yoga. n.

00:19:12.607 --> 00:19:15.782
Thats why you are so important.

00:19:15.982 --> 00:19:19.022
You dont know the role of woman is so important,

00:19:19.222 --> 00:19:25.428
so very important that she can change the whole family

00:19:25.628 --> 00:19:28.350
into a beautiful garden.

00:19:28.550 --> 00:19:36.670
It is her own sweetness, her own creative mind of love

00:19:36.870 --> 00:19:42.758
that can work it out. Must find out the art of love

00:19:42.958 --> 00:19:48.445
and work it out on anybody who is disturbed,

00:19:48.645 --> 00:19:54.615
or who is unhappy, or who is crossed. You can do it.

00:19:54.816 --> 00:19:59.898
You should know how to pacify that person and how to impress.

00:20:00.098 --> 00:20:04.414
First quality you must have is the generosity of character.

00:20:04.614 --> 00:20:08.716
You should not mind giving up anything to anyone

00:20:08.916 --> 00:20:12.857
if they want. You will enjoy your generosity now

00:20:13.057 --> 00:20:17.256
and in that you should be generous when you forgive others.

00:20:17.456 --> 00:20:20.149
Forgiveness is very important,

00:20:20.349 --> 00:20:25.250
and then you will never feel the brunt of your married life.

00:20:25.450 --> 00:20:27.622
Forgive.

00:20:27.823 --> 00:20:31.492
Also you have to forgive yourself. Not to feel guilty,

00:20:31.692 --> 00:20:34.709
not to feel guilty at all about anything,

00:20:34.909 --> 00:20:38.061
because after all you are also Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:38.261 --> 00:20:43.514
and if you have done anything wrong,
its all right, doesnt matter.

00:20:43.714 --> 00:20:51.933
But you should have the sweetness, the sweetness of a wife

00:20:52.133 --> 00:20:58.534
who will emit love and peace to others.

00:20:58.734 --> 00:21:02.089
You should not be source of some sort of a

00:21:02.289 --> 00:21:06.219
dominating personality or a person who is aggressive,

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:10.891
not at all. On the contrary you are the one who can bear

00:21:11.091 --> 00:21:16.594
lots of things and make a fun out
of every nonsense that you see.

00:21:16.794 --> 00:21:23.634
Nothing is so serious to fight it,
but to make a fun out of all that

00:21:23.834 --> 00:21:26.298
and make a fun for every one.

00:21:26.498 --> 00:21:29.861
Thats what you have to be, always smiling and happy.

00:21:30.061 --> 00:21:33.814
You will be amazed, you can make beautiful marriages

00:21:34.014 --> 00:21:38.835
for yourself, for your husband and all for Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:39.035 --> 00:21:43.866
So I am also very sure, if you make a successful marriage,

00:21:44.066 --> 00:21:46.608
you will have very, very good children

00:21:46.808 --> 00:21:51.069
who will be born realized. So you should be good mothers.

00:21:51.269 --> 00:21:55.943
Mothers who can really do good to the children

00:21:56.143 --> 00:21:59.373
and to other children also.

00:21:59.573 --> 00:22:03.568
All that is stored for you in future.

00:22:03.768 --> 00:22:08.776
I know youll all be enjoying very much your future life

00:22:08.976 --> 00:22:12.932
and make it so beautiful that everybody should talk,

00:22:13.132 --> 00:22:15.825
that look at these Sahaja Yoginis,

00:22:16.025 --> 00:22:18.315
how they have made their lives happy!

00:22:18.515 --> 00:22:20.776
Its a very, very important thing

00:22:20.976 --> 00:22:25.955
that we should pay attention to our own mistakes

00:22:26.155 --> 00:22:31.150
than to the mistakes of others, and try to correct them.

00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:36.583
See, they are themselves capable of looking after themselves.

00:22:36.783 --> 00:22:38.966
Only you should care for them

00:22:39.166 --> 00:22:43.765
and also you should in every way be very kind and gentle.

00:22:43.965 --> 00:22:46.273
I am sure you all can make

00:22:46.474 --> 00:22:52.691
very, very good families which
nowadays are not available.

00:22:52.891 --> 00:22:56.003
You dont see people who are happy in the family.

00:22:56.203 --> 00:22:58.909
So no complaints about the husband,

00:22:59.109 --> 00:23:02.414
no complaints about anybody to the husband,

00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:06.016
but you make yourself so sweet

00:23:06.216 --> 00:23:14.789
that everybody wants to take your guidance, your love

00:23:14.989 --> 00:23:18.906
and theyll come to you. I am sure this you can work it out.

00:23:19.106 --> 00:23:22.733
There are so many Sahaja Yoginis who have brought such credit

00:23:22.933 --> 00:23:25.702
to Me and have done such good work.

00:23:25.902 --> 00:23:28.217
I expect the same from you.

00:23:28.417 --> 00:23:32.386
May God bless you.

00:23:36.589 --> 00:23:38.941
This ceremony is called as Gauri Puja,

00:23:39.142 --> 00:23:42.362
means you are still Gauris. You are the

00:23:42.563 --> 00:23:45.261
Gauris and that the virgins,

00:23:45.462 --> 00:23:48.590
and you have to worship the Mother

00:23:48.790 --> 00:23:55.545
for your future life as married women.
