07:28.388 --> 07:34.380
Talks to Brides and to Grooms.  Delhi (India), 23 March 2000.

07:35.029 --> 07:39.505
Talk to Grooms.

07:39.806 --> 07:44.387
I am very happy to see you all here,

07:44.587 --> 07:47.610
and you should know you are

07:47.811 --> 07:51.272
going for a little different life,

07:51.473 --> 07:56.676
that you are getting married in Sahaja Yoga.

07:57.567 --> 08:00.289
There’s a difference between

08:00.489 --> 08:03.976
the other marriages and Sahaja Yoga marriage

08:04.176 --> 08:10.468
in which we understand that marriage has to be

08:10.668 --> 08:16.292
a special, as they call yagnya,

08:16.492 --> 08:23.255
means a special type of a holy alliance

08:23.455 --> 08:32.935
in which you have to lead a very Sahaj life with your wife

08:33.135 --> 08:37.835
and to understand her. She is also Sahaja Yogini.

08:38.035 --> 08:42.522
So you must respect her and you must love her,

08:42.722 --> 08:46.410
and she should really understand

08:46.611 --> 08:53.813
that you are her caring, loving, gentle husband.

08:54.013 --> 08:57.461
You must show all concern about her

08:57.661 --> 09:00.157
because she is a Sahaja Yogini.

09:00.357 --> 09:05.897
She is not an ordinary woman,
and with that respect I am sure

09:06.097 --> 09:12.354
youll be able to lead a very beautiful Sahaj married life.

09:12.554 --> 09:16.104
As it is, in Sahaja Yoga, as you know

09:16.304 --> 09:20.214
we dont criticize each other.

09:20.414 --> 09:24.604
We see the good points of another person

09:24.804 --> 09:28.963
and we have a great capacity to forgive.

09:29.163 --> 09:34.017
So to forgive is not to tolerate or to suffer,

09:34.217 --> 09:39.095
but you forgive just because you are very noble,

09:39.295 --> 09:41.564
you are a Sahaja Yogi.

09:41.764 --> 09:47.141
So dont try to find faults with your wife all the time.

09:47.341 --> 09:50.672
Also you shouldnt give her all the time

09:50.872 --> 09:55.786
orders this, do this, do that - but join hands with her.

09:55.986 --> 09:59.075
Because in Sahaja Yoga we dont believe

09:59.275 --> 10:04.389
in an individuals rights as to dominate another person.

10:04.589 --> 10:09.210
So what you should see the need to help her,

10:09.410 --> 10:15.810
to understand her and to share all the problems.

10:16.010 --> 10:18.615
Not to put problems on to her,

10:18.815 --> 10:24.553
but to give her all the helping hand that is needed.

10:24.753 --> 10:27.404
Shes your companion. Shes not your slave.

10:27.604 --> 10:29.748
Shes not your servant,

10:29.948 --> 10:34.741
neither you are sort of, I should say, a boss of her.

10:34.941 --> 10:40.038
So all those qualities are not to be seen in a Sahaja Yogi,

10:40.238 --> 10:42.772
and understanding is the best part.

10:42.972 --> 10:48.390
Try to understand her side also.

10:48.590 --> 10:52.507
Sometimes they are coming from another country

10:52.707 --> 10:56.453
and are of a different culture.

10:56.653 --> 11:00.764
So try to understand. This is how youll understand

11:00.964 --> 11:05.944
what is the culture of that country from where she comes.

11:06.144 --> 11:09.816
Also its good for children that you must always respect,

11:10.016 --> 11:13.176
always respect your wife.

11:13.376 --> 11:17.269
You shouldnt have some sort of a ideal about your wife.

11:17.469 --> 11:21.803
And, forget about all the other conditionings you have had

11:22.003 --> 11:24.248
or you have seen in the society.

11:24.448 --> 11:26.522
You are a very different people.

11:26.722 --> 11:31.509
You are absolutely chosen people

11:31.709 --> 11:34.978
for a very special work of Sahaja Yoga.

11:35.178 --> 11:38.845
So once you start understanding this point

11:39.045 --> 11:45.764
that you are here to marry girls who are Sahaja Yoginis

11:45.964 --> 11:48.225
and who will look after you.

11:48.425 --> 11:51.250
I will also tell them what they have to do.

11:51.450 --> 11:56.219
But I would request you that do not have domination of a man

11:56.419 --> 11:58.570
or thinking that you are

11:58.770 --> 12:03.967
the head of the family to trouble the wife.

12:04.167 --> 12:07.404
Share with her. Please understand that

12:07.604 --> 12:10.951
and once you start doing that, you will enjoy

12:11.151 --> 12:14.154
helping her and understanding her.

12:14.354 --> 12:17.586
I hope your marriages are very, very successful

12:17.786 --> 12:21.040
and that you get very beautiful, sweet children

12:21.240 --> 12:23.578
who are born realized souls.

12:23.778 --> 12:27.557
I am sure you will have a very happy life ahead of you.

12:27.757 --> 12:34.596
So go for that, go for a happy life by making her happy,

12:34.796 --> 12:41.185
by making every one happy and looking
after everything in a Sahaj way.

12:41.385 --> 12:45.060
So may God bless you all.

12:45.260 --> 12:49.291
I am sorry, you have to wait...

14:25.714 --> 14:32.284
Talk to Brides

14:33.250 --> 14:37.495
Very nice to see all of you so beautifully dressed

14:37.695 --> 14:41.938
and looking so nice.

14:43.248 --> 14:47.352
I want to tell you one thing,

14:47.552 --> 14:52.995
that you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga to Sahaja Yogis.

14:53.195 --> 14:55.932
Always remember this point.

14:56.132 --> 15:00.010
As it is, we see there are so many marriages breaking

15:00.210 --> 15:04.256
and all kinds of things happening in Sahaja Yoga.

15:04.456 --> 15:10.163
Also, we get sometimes one percent. Only one percent! Why?

15:10.363 --> 15:15.054
Because they understand the responsibility as Sahaja Yogis.

15:15.254 --> 15:19.046
So, I want all of you to remember

15:19.246 --> 15:23.570
that you are getting married to a Sahaja Yogi,

15:23.770 --> 15:27.445
and you must always remember this fact.

15:27.645 --> 15:30.101
You must respect him,

15:30.301 --> 15:34.994
you must look after him and care for him.

15:35.194 --> 15:40.533
Sometimes he may lose little bit of his balance.

15:40.733 --> 15:45.696
It is you who has to bring him back to balance

15:45.896 --> 15:50.289
with very gentle ways.

15:50.489 --> 16:00.450
It is your duty to preserve the society of Sahaja Yogis.

16:00.650 --> 16:05.064
People will come to your house. If they are Sahaja Yogis,

16:05.264 --> 16:09.923
their wives, their children, you must look after them

16:10.123 --> 16:15.975
because you are in charge of the society of Sahaja Yoga.

16:16.175 --> 16:20.057
You may be earning a lot, you may be very well equipped,

16:20.269 --> 16:24.669
must be that, but you must always be humble

16:24.869 --> 16:28.583
and understand that

16:28.783 --> 16:33.349
you have to carry all the work of Sahaja Yoga

16:33.549 --> 16:36.044
through your marriage.

16:36.244 --> 16:39.021
This is a very big responsibility.

16:39.221 --> 16:44.911
In your case it is the preservation of the society

16:45.111 --> 16:50.098
that is of Sahaja Yoga people, their children.

16:50.298 --> 16:55.680
So you have to love all of them.

16:55.880 --> 16:58.130
You must care for them.

16:58.331 --> 17:04.932
Never think this is your own house and
that you are the queen of the house.

17:05.132 --> 17:11.354
But you are the mother, you are the sister,

17:11.554 --> 17:20.797
you are the complete relation of
these people who are Sahaja Yogis.

17:20.997 --> 17:23.320
So when they come to your house

17:23.520 --> 17:26.294
you must show all respect and regard.

17:26.494 --> 17:31.231
Never complain about them to your husband. He wont like it.

17:31.431 --> 17:37.032
And also you must remember that your patience

17:37.232 --> 17:41.821
and your love and your guidance

17:42.021 --> 17:47.310
will definitely help to build your married life.

17:47.510 --> 17:49.802
If you want to be happy, you must know

17:50.002 --> 17:52.513
how to make others happy also.

17:52.713 --> 17:56.622
If you do not know how to make others happy,

17:56.822 --> 17:58.822
you can never be happy.

17:59.023 --> 18:02.153
So, you should not think about your own demands,

18:02.353 --> 18:05.697
your own needs,

18:05.898 --> 18:11.606
your own, you can say, ideas or anything.

18:11.806 --> 18:14.385
Whatever is there you have to do it

18:14.385 --> 18:20.057
in a very gentle manner because you are the women,

18:20.258 --> 18:22.313
you are the ladies.

18:22.514 --> 18:27.383
So your style should be gentle, should not shout,

18:27.583 --> 18:30.649
you should not get angry,

18:30.849 --> 18:35.243
you should not treat anyone sharply.

18:35.443 --> 18:40.524
I will immediately know who is an unkind hostess.

18:40.724 --> 18:45.313
That people will tell Me that, Mother she is a funny woman,

18:45.513 --> 18:50.085
she doesnt know how to behave. So I dont want to hear that.

18:50.285 --> 18:56.176
I want to hear that you are very sweet, nice wives

18:56.376 --> 19:02.887
who will look after the husband, who will
look after the family of Sahaja Yogis.

19:03.087 --> 19:07.172
Thats your job. Theres nothing to feel degraded in that

19:07.372 --> 19:12.407
or less in that. Thats what is you have to do in Sahaja Yoga. n.

19:12.607 --> 19:15.782
Thats why you are so important.

19:15.982 --> 19:19.022
You dont know the role of woman is so important,

19:19.222 --> 19:25.428
so very important that she can change the whole family

19:25.628 --> 19:28.350
into a beautiful garden.

19:28.550 --> 19:36.670
It is her own sweetness, her own creative mind of love

19:36.870 --> 19:42.758
that can work it out. Must find out the art of love

19:42.958 --> 19:48.445
and work it out on anybody who is disturbed,

19:48.645 --> 19:54.615
or who is unhappy, or who is crossed. You can do it.

19:54.816 --> 19:59.898
You should know how to pacify that person and how to impress.

20:00.098 --> 20:04.414
First quality you must have is the generosity of character.

20:04.614 --> 20:08.716
You should not mind giving up anything to anyone

20:08.916 --> 20:12.857
if they want. You will enjoy your generosity now

20:13.057 --> 20:17.256
and in that you should be generous when you forgive others.

20:17.456 --> 20:20.149
Forgiveness is very important,

20:20.349 --> 20:25.250
and then you will never feel the brunt of your married life.

20:25.450 --> 20:27.622
Forgive.

20:27.823 --> 20:31.492
Also you have to forgive yourself. Not to feel guilty,

20:31.692 --> 20:34.709
not to feel guilty at all about anything,

20:34.909 --> 20:38.061
because after all you are also Sahaja Yogis,

20:38.261 --> 20:43.514
and if you have done anything wrong,
its all right, doesnt matter.

20:43.714 --> 20:51.933
But you should have the sweetness, the sweetness of a wife

20:52.133 --> 20:58.534
who will emit love and peace to others.

20:58.734 --> 21:02.089
You should not be source of some sort of a

21:02.289 --> 21:06.219
dominating personality or a person who is aggressive,

21:06.419 --> 21:10.891
not at all. On the contrary you are the one who can bear

21:11.091 --> 21:16.594
lots of things and make a fun out
of every nonsense that you see.

21:16.794 --> 21:23.634
Nothing is so serious to fight it,
but to make a fun out of all that

21:23.834 --> 21:26.298
and make a fun for every one.

21:26.498 --> 21:29.861
Thats what you have to be, always smiling and happy.

21:30.061 --> 21:33.814
You will be amazed, you can make beautiful marriages

21:34.014 --> 21:38.835
for yourself, for your husband and all for Sahaja Yoga.

21:39.035 --> 21:43.866
So I am also very sure, if you make a successful marriage,

21:44.066 --> 21:46.608
you will have very, very good children

21:46.808 --> 21:51.069
who will be born realized. So you should be good mothers.

21:51.269 --> 21:55.943
Mothers who can really do good to the children

21:56.143 --> 21:59.373
and to other children also.

21:59.573 --> 22:03.568
All that is stored for you in future.

22:03.768 --> 22:08.776
I know youll all be enjoying very much your future life

22:08.976 --> 22:12.932
and make it so beautiful that everybody should talk,

22:13.132 --> 22:15.825
that look at these Sahaja Yoginis,

22:16.025 --> 22:18.315
how they have made their lives happy!

22:18.515 --> 22:20.776
Its a very, very important thing

22:20.976 --> 22:25.955
that we should pay attention to our own mistakes

22:26.155 --> 22:31.150
than to the mistakes of others, and try to correct them.

22:31.350 --> 22:36.583
See, they are themselves capable of looking after themselves.

22:36.783 --> 22:38.966
Only you should care for them

22:39.166 --> 22:43.765
and also you should in every way be very kind and gentle.

22:43.965 --> 22:46.273
I am sure you all can make

22:46.474 --> 22:52.691
very, very good families which
nowadays are not available.

22:52.891 --> 22:56.003
You dont see people who are happy in the family.

22:56.203 --> 22:58.909
So no complaints about the husband,

22:59.109 --> 23:02.414
no complaints about anybody to the husband,

23:02.614 --> 23:06.016
but you make yourself so sweet

23:06.216 --> 23:14.789
that everybody wants to take your guidance, your love

23:14.989 --> 23:18.906
and theyll come to you. I am sure this you can work it out.

23:19.106 --> 23:22.733
There are so many Sahaja Yoginis who have brought such credit

23:22.933 --> 23:25.702
to Me and have done such good work.

23:25.902 --> 23:28.217
I expect the same from you.

23:28.417 --> 23:32.386
May God bless you.

23:36.589 --> 23:38.941
This ceremony is called as Gauri Puja,

23:39.142 --> 23:42.362
means you are still Gauris. You are the

23:42.563 --> 23:45.261
Gauris and that the virgins,

23:45.462 --> 23:48.590
and you have to worship the Mother

23:48.790 --> 23:55.545
for your future life as married women.
