[Music]

00:28.320 --> 00:37.629
this understanding of what you have

00:33.700 --> 00:41.860
achieved in sahaja yoga should

00:37.629 --> 00:50.580
immediately make you realize what you

00:41.860 --> 00:53.980
are and when it all has happened to us

00:50.580 --> 01:01.120
automatically you should be very sincere

00:53.980 --> 01:04.720
about it you must feel that something

01:01.120 --> 01:10.450
really we have achieved or something so

01:04.720 --> 01:15.250
great so we have to be sincere mentally

01:10.450 --> 01:18.600
also we should feel that so this is

01:15.250 --> 01:23.710
first thing you do is to mentally feel

01:18.600 --> 01:30.869
to maintain you feel that it's so

01:23.710 --> 01:38.740
important but the second part is

01:30.869 --> 01:43.030
different where you see something you

01:38.740 --> 01:47.109
know something and you start opening

01:43.030 --> 01:51.509
your heart about it in the second part

01:47.109 --> 01:54.579
you have to open your heart

01:51.509 --> 01:59.950
so the sincerity comes from an open

01:54.579 --> 02:03.100
heart if your heart is not open you

01:59.950 --> 02:07.469
cannot be sincere now what does it mean

02:03.100 --> 02:07.469
that your heart is not open let us see

02:10.390 --> 02:17.900
we are born again you have got your

02:14.599 --> 02:24.769
realization also it is your birthday in

02:17.900 --> 02:28.609
a way but in the growth of your

02:24.769 --> 02:33.620
knowledge and understanding you have not

02:28.609 --> 02:36.799
kept pace with your heart but what is

02:33.620 --> 02:43.879
the reason for that what is it that

02:36.799 --> 02:47.840
keeps your heart like you can discover

02:43.879 --> 02:54.159
very easily that your heart moves the

02:47.840 --> 03:01.159
body moves your brain everything because

02:54.159 --> 03:04.849
if your heart stops everything stops but

03:01.159 --> 03:07.010
if your brain stops hardcore stuff so

03:04.849 --> 03:12.200
heart is the most important thing and it

03:07.010 --> 03:19.609
governs the whole being within you now

03:12.200 --> 03:29.629
this special instrument which is very

03:19.609 --> 03:30.909
delicate which circulates also is like a

03:29.629 --> 03:34.840
stone

03:30.909 --> 03:34.840
how will it pulsate

03:36.910 --> 03:46.090
so when we say enlarge your heart it

03:42.370 --> 03:49.090
means that the stone enos of your heart

03:46.090 --> 03:55.230
has to be melted away how does it become

03:49.090 --> 03:55.230
stony we have to go to the roots of that

03:55.440 --> 04:05.500
it becomes like a stone because the

04:00.010 --> 04:08.470
heart controls the brain as there are

04:05.500 --> 04:10.870
seven auras on your brain in the same

04:08.470 --> 04:16.390
way there are seven auras on your heart

04:10.870 --> 04:25.090
and all those are us and the ones which

04:16.390 --> 04:28.210
control them on us of the wave now on

04:25.090 --> 04:32.470
the brain as you know there are two

04:28.210 --> 04:36.160
institutions of ego and conditionings we

04:32.470 --> 04:39.960
start pressing the brain too much as a

04:36.160 --> 04:39.960
result of all these auras get dressed

04:40.860 --> 04:47.410
so the auras which are surrounding the

04:43.930 --> 04:58.870
heart also the treasure so this

04:47.410 --> 05:04.210
conditioning makes the brain pervert but

04:58.870 --> 05:12.310
it doesn't make it a stone only what

05:04.210 --> 05:14.460
makes it a stone is that if he is born

05:12.310 --> 05:18.580
with some sort of a mental derangement

05:14.460 --> 05:20.650
that he cannot think otherwise the brain

05:18.580 --> 05:22.780
goes on thinking whether with

05:20.650 --> 05:29.550
conditionings or with it it goes on

05:22.780 --> 05:29.550
thinking such a brain

05:31.870 --> 05:39.760
should not affect the heart because

05:34.520 --> 05:43.000
heart affects a brain but the auras

05:39.760 --> 05:50.330
which are manifested from the heart

05:43.000 --> 05:53.090
start becoming dull or disappear so the

05:50.330 --> 05:57.350
auras around the heart are very

05:53.090 --> 06:03.010
sensitive and they feel no use throwing

05:57.350 --> 06:05.900
light on the brain they start becoming

06:03.010 --> 06:10.910
smaller and smaller and that's how the

06:05.900 --> 06:13.970
heart becomes small because they have no

06:10.910 --> 06:16.940
purpose in life them so they start

06:13.970 --> 06:19.790
becoming smaller and smaller as a result

06:16.940 --> 06:22.220
the heart becomes small we call somebody

06:19.790 --> 06:25.010
is really small hearted fellow is a

06:22.220 --> 06:29.270
chicken hearted you know we always say

06:25.010 --> 06:34.130
such a man is a stone hearted person all

06:29.270 --> 06:36.980
these happens because of the

06:34.130 --> 06:46.220
conditionings and the ego of the human

06:36.980 --> 06:50.090
mind and the result is felt but the

06:46.220 --> 06:55.400
heart becoming a stone because heart is

06:50.090 --> 06:59.870
a sensitive thing brain is not that that

06:55.400 --> 07:02.080
is how we do not know how to be kind to

06:59.870 --> 07:06.880
others how to be nice how to be helpful

07:02.080 --> 07:18.410
how to be gentle and how to be

07:06.880 --> 07:21.260
reassuring protecting others all this we

07:18.410 --> 07:23.540
have inherited already we have already

07:21.260 --> 07:25.970
got a stone art when we come to sahaja

07:23.540 --> 07:29.570
yoga and we have a brain either full of

07:25.970 --> 07:32.870
ego or super-ego so now with your

07:29.570 --> 07:36.530
Kundalini rising you can clear out your

07:32.870 --> 07:40.150
head first of all so the sincerity will

07:36.530 --> 07:41.710
come when the Kundalini will move and

07:40.150 --> 07:44.270
touch

07:41.710 --> 07:48.589
Ramananda which is the seat of your

07:44.270 --> 07:50.990
heart and will expand then the heart

07:48.589 --> 07:55.369
just comes back like a king returns back

07:50.990 --> 07:58.129
and start dominating the brain so the

07:55.369 --> 07:59.389
relationship between the truth has to be

07:58.129 --> 08:01.520
fully understood

07:59.389 --> 08:04.189
at first the domination of the heart

08:01.520 --> 08:08.779
although we can say the king hood of

08:04.189 --> 08:11.449
heart is cherished is put down not to

08:08.779 --> 08:17.770
zero and then this brain becomes the

08:11.449 --> 08:25.189
king and he starts ruling us I think I

08:17.770 --> 08:33.169
feel means the brain the even if you

08:25.189 --> 08:36.800
could give up I think I want everything

08:33.169 --> 08:41.509
with your eyes you should say I want

08:36.800 --> 08:43.729
another point this body wants you

08:41.509 --> 08:46.880
separate yourself gradually you start

08:43.729 --> 08:49.399
separating yourself from all such

08:46.880 --> 08:51.860
situations by never saying I want you

08:49.399 --> 08:57.139
say this body this heart

08:51.860 --> 09:00.139
they said you start separating and once

08:57.139 --> 09:04.519
you are separated all these barriers of

09:00.139 --> 09:08.149
ego and super-ego will disappear but as

09:04.519 --> 09:11.329
it is also it's very easy to get rid of

09:08.149 --> 09:14.209
these two it's very easy to get rid of

09:11.329 --> 09:19.490
these two only by raising your kundalini

09:14.209 --> 09:22.009
and breaking here Ramanathan this is the

09:19.490 --> 09:24.560
greatest achievement that you know that

09:22.009 --> 09:27.410
you can break your brahmarandra

09:24.560 --> 09:29.269
make your kundalini get connected with

09:27.410 --> 09:31.250
the all-pervading power that's why I

09:29.269 --> 09:33.560
always say you must meditate and you

09:31.250 --> 09:36.319
must be in thoughtless awareness then it

09:33.560 --> 09:37.939
works out don't pay attention to outside

09:36.319 --> 09:40.910
things so much tasting you should

09:37.939 --> 09:43.040
decorate yourself within yours with

09:40.910 --> 09:46.699
sincerity it nice thoughts about

09:43.040 --> 09:51.250
yourself that you are capable absolutely

09:46.699 --> 09:54.840
capable people and you can use your

09:51.250 --> 09:56.820
imagination you are

09:54.840 --> 10:01.560
intelligence rationality whatever you

09:56.820 --> 10:04.770
think you have to find the way to find

10:01.560 --> 10:07.430
the way again I say to keep your heart

10:04.770 --> 10:07.430
large
