34:19.327 --> 34:25.975
I wanted to be with you people
on a Christmas day,

34:26.344 --> 34:29.888
but it never happened before.

34:30.088 --> 34:36.049
It has so chanced that I have to be here
with you today and on the New Year.

34:36.250 --> 34:39.221
Something good has to happen
I hope next year,

34:39.422 --> 34:43.125
some good luck has to come.

34:47.352 --> 34:55.236
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

34:55.437 --> 35:02.572
was planned in such a manner that
He was to be born

35:02.773 --> 35:09.299
in a place which was very humble,
very humble place.

35:09.500 --> 35:15.346
Because He came to teach us humility.

35:15.546 --> 35:23.421
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

35:25.108 --> 35:35.205
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
to activate this humility.

35:35.406 --> 35:42.194
Actually He came on this earth
first of all

35:44.155 --> 35:50.319
to create a space within us,
at the Agnya chakra,

35:51.636 --> 35:59.062
by removing the hurdles of the ego,
hurdles of the ego.

36:01.546 --> 36:05.662
He had to talk of humility that time,

36:05.862 --> 36:11.284
because Romans were ruling and they
were very arrogant,

36:11.484 --> 36:20.500
very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped,
we should say, not at all evolved.

36:20.722 --> 36:28.555
Like, you can say some of the animals,
which came into being

36:28.757 --> 36:33.883
and were thrown out of the evolutionary
process later on because they were useless,

36:34.084 --> 36:41.955
too aggressive or too big for their size
or some sort of a thing like that.

36:42.155 --> 36:45.358
In the same way Romans were.

36:46.702 --> 36:52.357
If you see their body, even now,
painted sometimes,

36:52.557 --> 36:56.522
you’ll find that it was not like
a human body, it was like

36:56.723 --> 37:00.276
some animals you see, the muscles
and all that was very grotesque.

37:00.476 --> 37:07.920
There was no softness, no roundishness,
on their faces.

37:08.252 --> 37:15.519
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

37:15.719 --> 37:21.233
because when you have somebody
as an ideal before you,

37:21.433 --> 37:29.209
and always people see who dominates them,
and then such a person becomes their ideal.

37:29.409 --> 37:35.774
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

37:35.975 --> 37:40.828
You see, somebody who is condescending,
you also become suddenly condescending.

37:41.028 --> 37:44.462
You see somebody who is very egoistical
and tries to show off,

37:44.663 --> 37:50.204
you also put up air. You can see this
everyday happening,

37:50.405 --> 37:57.991
that a boss comes in who is a very,
very airy person,

37:58.192 --> 38:01.472
everybody in the office is like that.

38:02.787 --> 38:05.998
And that’s how Romans affected the people
in those days

38:06.198 --> 38:09.002
by creating their own ideals, people
thought they are the ideals,

38:09.203 --> 38:17.155
they are the best, because they had
produced results according to them.

38:17.713 --> 38:21.784
They were so powerful, they thought
this was the power.

38:21.984 --> 38:27.555
And that’s why they followed their methods,
many people who were not even Romans.

38:27.755 --> 38:33.077
The another humbler group was
affected because

38:33.277 --> 38:36.848
they were hurt, their ego was hurt.

38:37.048 --> 38:41.147
So they became equally violent

38:41.348 --> 38:46.321
in the sense that they were so touchy
that you could not say anything to them,

38:46.522 --> 38:52.459
they would just come and bark on you,
frightened people.

38:54.186 --> 38:59.551
This kind of character is very dangerous
also,

38:59.813 --> 39:04.890
because that gives you some sort of very
bad diseases: can give you leprosy,

39:05.090 --> 39:07.882
people develop leprosy with that kind
of character,

39:08.082 --> 39:10.505
if you develop a barking temperament

39:10.705 --> 39:15.034
of a nature by which you just jump
at people.

39:15.234 --> 39:21.626
Nerves become absolutely
sort of shattered by it,

39:21.827 --> 39:27.257
and the leprosy is the disease
of the nerves.

39:27.457 --> 39:33.512
Those people who always keep themselves
under such strain

39:33.972 --> 39:36.660
and jump at every person who comes
along

39:36.860 --> 39:41.676
are very dangerously placed as far
as their nerves are concerned.

39:44.792 --> 39:50.442
And then a horrible type of virus
you know that which creates leprosy

39:50.643 --> 39:56.114
attacks these nerves, can attack because
they are very vulnerable,

39:56.315 --> 40:00.017
these kind of people who jump
on the others.

40:00.219 --> 40:03.055
That’s why there was so much leprosy,
in that small little place

40:03.256 --> 40:09.442
there were so many lepers, because
their nerves were shattered.

40:13.978 --> 40:17.043
In those circumstances Christ was born.

40:17.243 --> 40:20.897
But He was not only born just for Romans
or for anyone,

40:21.098 --> 40:23.873
but He was born for the whole world.

40:24.073 --> 40:29.405
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

40:29.606 --> 40:34.910
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

40:35.348 --> 40:41.242
And that demarcated the way human
beings were going on.

40:41.443 --> 40:47.912
So they had to be controlled first of all,

40:48.113 --> 40:51.810
and Christ had to come at a time where

40:52.011 --> 40:57.641
a balance between ego and superego
was to be established.

41:01.269 --> 41:03.566
So the first thing that was said
about Christ throughout

41:03.767 --> 41:10.520
in all these music and songs you have
heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth.’

41:13.379 --> 41:17.871
He came to create peace on earth.

41:19.550 --> 41:25.517
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

41:25.717 --> 41:29.488
secondly when you are Realized.

41:29.689 --> 41:33.139
Both things should be there. If only you
get your Realization

41:33.340 --> 41:38.520
and there is no balance in you,
there cannot be peace.

41:39.106 --> 41:47.369
But peace never means in any way,
is a personality that recedes back,

41:47.569 --> 41:52.102
runs away from situations,
escapist,

41:52.302 --> 41:57.477
who does not want to face the reality -
never means that.

41:57.950 --> 42:05.192
Christ is pictured very differently
from what He was.

42:05.820 --> 42:09.070
He was the healthiest personality
you could think of,

42:09.273 --> 42:13.659
and the humblest man you could
think of.

42:13.860 --> 42:19.934
And He would not stand any nonsense,
nobody could take liberties with Him.

42:20.135 --> 42:24.570
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

42:24.770 --> 42:31.278
Extremely compassionate, extremely
kind, but very powerful.

42:31.479 --> 42:34.590
This is the balance.

42:38.406 --> 42:42.569
So He came on this earth to create
peace within our minds.

42:42.770 --> 42:46.569
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

42:46.770 --> 42:49.631
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

42:49.832 --> 42:56.859
When this peace will be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

42:57.060 --> 43:01.051
Human beings are violent to each other.

43:02.724 --> 43:07.327
Ego developed subtler ways and
subtler ways.

43:07.528 --> 43:14.784
Then, provocative ways started
coming up also from the superego,

43:14.985 --> 43:21.114
sly methods from the superego.
The conflict started.

43:22.818 --> 43:29.200
And at that time, to overcome
that conflict,

43:30.738 --> 43:35.763
the best thing was to create a space
in Agnya,

43:35.964 --> 43:40.082
in the center, in thoughtless awareness.

43:41.212 --> 43:45.309
That’s how Christ had to come
on this earth.

43:45.869 --> 43:51.778
The birth is very, very symbolic.

43:53.146 --> 44:01.803
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya,
He’s nothing but the Word as you call it,

44:02.004 --> 44:07.247
Logos – I don’t know what all words
you have got in language,

44:07.447 --> 44:11.881
the Shabda, as they call it,
is the Aumkara –

44:12.081 --> 44:18.910
He was to be born in this way, because
He had no body,

44:24.028 --> 44:27.762
and the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

44:28.043 --> 44:36.436
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

44:36.676 --> 44:41.289
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger, for people,

44:41.528 --> 44:50.645
that look at this: the King of Heaven
should…

44:51.911 --> 44:55.286
[Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Now she does
that to understand.

45:02.333 --> 45:05.958
(To the little girl who wants again
something:) Don’t go near that.]

45:12.558 --> 45:25.692
So the story of His birth was very
interesting tale.

45:28.208 --> 45:35.207
It was very symbolic that He came
in a humble place,

45:36.612 --> 45:39.834
because people were so proud
of their money,

45:40.035 --> 45:44.483
so arrogant because of their power
that they had.

45:44.683 --> 45:49.129
Even today all the Christian nations
are like that.

45:49.473 --> 45:53.644
Surprisingly, Christian nations should be
so arrogant

45:53.807 --> 46:01.926
and so power-drunk and think no end
of themselves because they are affluent.

46:03.752 --> 46:08.249
Think of the Christian nations being
very poor,

46:08.450 --> 46:12.254
do you think they would have had
racial problem?

46:15.237 --> 46:21.801
They don’t have racial problems
with Arabs. Not at all.

46:23.598 --> 46:27.975
As simple as that. No problem with Arabs.

46:28.157 --> 46:33.613
They have no race, Arabs have no race,
they have money, money race.

46:33.917 --> 46:39.214
Those people who hanker after money
are only bowing down to money.

46:39.534 --> 46:43.800
They have no respect for anything
else but for money.

46:47.920 --> 46:53.372
Those who have money and think
of money

46:53.573 --> 47:00.956
are another lot which is going to go out
of the circulation of evolution.

47:01.156 --> 47:04.581
They are going out already.

47:04.964 --> 47:09.263
The second lot is the one which was
like Romans.

47:09.464 --> 47:15.487
They had a fall, they were all finished
because they were power-drunk.

47:15.706 --> 47:24.299
They drank away, their civilization
completely finished off and they are out.

47:26.471 --> 47:29.849
You’ve seen Portugal, you’ll be amazed,
it’s happening there.

47:30.049 --> 47:34.251
The ego of Portuguese was so great,
you can’t believe

47:34.451 --> 47:38.998
that that country is a desolate country,
there’s nothing now,

47:39.199 --> 47:43.377
big-big, huge big buildings, which you see

47:43.577 --> 47:46.394
and you know they must have been rich
once upon a time.

47:46.594 --> 47:49.266
And there’s nothing left with them
except for their antique shops

47:49.467 --> 47:52.499
which are never open.

47:53.508 --> 48:00.706
This kind of a ego is again revived

48:02.643 --> 48:12.057
and that revival came up, imagine,
in the name of Christ. Imagine!

48:13.792 --> 48:18.893
They purchased people to be
converted as Christians.

48:19.286 --> 48:21.031
They gave them money,

48:21.231 --> 48:27.534
is all money, money propositions,
money enterprise going on.

48:29.893 --> 48:34.725
Jews the same, then the Christians
the same.

48:34.926 --> 48:38.615
He was born in a manger.

48:39.322 --> 48:49.917
For a little child to be put in a manger
by the Mahalakshmi, it’s too much.

48:50.323 --> 48:52.719
See how symbolic it is, Mahalakshmi,

48:52.919 --> 49:00.901
was not Lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi to put
the child in the manger.

49:02.284 --> 49:04.605
No place.

49:04.805 --> 49:12.739
We have at least Chelsham Road,
Warwick Road,

49:12.940 --> 49:20.003
Bramham Gardens, Brompton Square.

49:22.784 --> 49:26.575
But the child was born and was put
in the manger,

49:26.780 --> 49:31.440
the humblest thing in this world
is a manger.

49:33.070 --> 49:37.503
The humblest of all, a crib,

49:37.831 --> 49:42.266
the Highest is put in the manger.

49:46.393 --> 49:49.339
So, what do we do?

49:50.061 --> 49:52.239
We think we should also sleep in a manger,

49:52.440 --> 49:58.770
we’ll become like Christ. There are people
who believe in such nonsensical things.

49:58.971 --> 50:02.494
They think that, you see if they have
all the money,

50:02.695 --> 50:06.628
they drink and do all kinds of things,
you see -

50:06.936 --> 50:10.425
I met one man one day,

50:11.186 --> 50:15.628
he was all drunk lying near a church.

50:16.370 --> 50:19.038
He was saying: “I’m Christ, I’m Christ.”

50:19.238 --> 50:25.011
He must have had got this idea that
he’s lying there because he’s very humble.

50:25.485 --> 50:29.883
This kind of ridiculous caricature

50:30.084 --> 50:36.234
of the whole beautiful symbol is followed
everywhere.

50:41.534 --> 50:46.440
So the arrogant and the egoistical might
say that: “Why, if He was the King,

50:46.641 --> 50:52.415
why was He born in the manger?
Why was He kept in the manger?”.

50:52.616 --> 50:56.698
Everybody will have their own concept.

50:59.178 --> 51:04.793
Even there are people in India, who are
stupid people, not wise,

51:04.994 --> 51:10.675
who say that He must have done lots
of bad karmas to be born like that.

51:12.206 --> 51:20.669
Because to them, karmas give you more
money, I mean, God is not so unintelligent.

51:20.870 --> 51:27.487
If you do good karmas you become men
of God, you become seekers.

51:30.761 --> 51:35.636
You get the blessings of God by your good
karmas, you’ll become religious people,

51:35.836 --> 51:39.927
not moneyed people who can go to pubs
and waste their lives.

51:40.128 --> 51:45.524
This is the idea they have got that
by doing good karmas you become rich,

51:45.725 --> 51:52.612
and become even worse for next life.
Some people may believe like that.

51:54.152 --> 51:58.793
But He never did any karmas.
He was in akarma Himself,

51:58.994 --> 52:01.749
so no question of His punishment
and all that,

52:01.949 --> 52:06.200
because just a drama, but very
symbolic it is.

52:06.401 --> 52:12.866
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort.

52:13.143 --> 52:18.584
Can there be any comfort in a manger?
Think like that.

52:18.785 --> 52:23.432
All the Christian nations are after
their comforts.

52:25.945 --> 52:28.440
Aren’t we?

52:29.221 --> 52:34.495
What we think is not comfortable,
it should be comfortable.

52:34.716 --> 52:42.198
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages of Christ’s birth.

52:45.234 --> 52:48.753
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ,

52:48.954 --> 52:52.706
because He was born in a manger.

52:53.266 --> 52:57.190
No comfort was provided for Him.

53:00.312 --> 53:05.531
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

53:05.731 --> 53:09.942
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

53:10.143 --> 53:14.652
Copying Him is not the way, is not
the way by copying Him

53:14.853 --> 53:20.621
that you will become Christ, but
by imbibing His qualities within you.

53:20.822 --> 53:23.159
I’ve known people who live in a pigsty,

53:23.366 --> 53:28.786
but once they get to a better life
they want everything else.

53:30.523 --> 53:40.284
So imbibing the quality of humility
and adjustment.

53:46.268 --> 53:49.815
Humility and adjustment.

53:52.721 --> 53:56.610
Anywhere you are put, anytime.

53:56.811 --> 54:02.638
Very particular about time. If somebody
has to come at ten o’clock,

54:02.839 --> 54:06.075
and if he has to do a job, if it is
[that] he’s delayed by five minutes,

54:06.276 --> 54:12.104
he starts breaking all the heavens,
just can’t bear it,

54:13.246 --> 54:16.992
he can’t bear it, five minutes he has
to wait.

54:17.192 --> 54:21.096
And if he has to wait ten minutes,
he’s out for a pub, finished.

54:21.297 --> 54:26.427
He cannot be pacifying himself unless
and until he takes a drink.

54:26.628 --> 54:31.905
This is the situation of a volcanic
human mind.

54:35.818 --> 54:39.241
So the peace has to come.

54:43.046 --> 54:48.008
How? If you seek comfort you’ll become
lazy lumps.

54:48.209 --> 54:52.694
You’ll sleep off, you’ll be lotus-eaters.

54:53.792 --> 54:59.812
But if you not seek comfort, then
peace will come.

55:04.255 --> 55:07.564
Because for our own comfort, for our
selfish comfort

55:07.765 --> 55:10.825
of this body we torture everybody else.

55:11.025 --> 55:14.312
The other day only I was telling that
only in the Western countries it is so,

55:14.521 --> 55:16.999
not in India.

55:17.521 --> 55:19.818
If somebody’s sleeping even till twelve
o’clock

55:19.995 --> 55:25.123
you cannot wake up that person,
is a irreligious act.

55:25.324 --> 55:28.095
I mean in India anybody who sleeps
after six o’clock

55:28.296 --> 55:31.319
he’ll feel ashamed of himself to be
sleeping that time.

55:31.520 --> 55:33.476
He’ll be apologetic the whole day

55:33.676 --> 55:35.248
and he’ll say that, “Oh, God, I’m sorry
I slept.”

55:35.448 --> 55:41.484
It’s regarded as sinful to sleep so late
as six o’clock in the morning.

55:41.921 --> 55:45.452
I mean, any country like that.

55:51.914 --> 55:57.459
So comfort has no end. There’s no end
to it.

55:57.659 --> 56:03.781
Comfort crawls upon you, what is comfort?
Let us see, very simple.

56:03.982 --> 56:08.203
In Christ’s symbolic life, its very deep
significance is this:

56:08.404 --> 56:13.261
that comfort is nothing but the matter
overpowering the Spirit.

56:13.462 --> 56:16.143
Do you see that point?

56:16.343 --> 56:19.704
If you are sitting on a chair, then
you can’t sit on the ground.

56:19.904 --> 56:22.831
If you are sitting on a sofa set you
can’t sit on a chair.

56:23.031 --> 56:27.228
If you are sitting on a velvet, then you
cannot sit you know on an ordinary thing.

56:27.429 --> 56:31.407
Is the matter always overpowering
the Spirit and He was the Spirit,

56:31.608 --> 56:36.398
what does it matter to Him? Whether
straw or anything?

56:42.663 --> 56:47.691
It is insurmountable, nothing can
displease the Spirit

56:47.891 --> 56:53.054
of these material things, I mean the matter
otherwise will take over.

56:57.120 --> 57:01.191
That is the thing is, one has
to understand,

57:03.507 --> 57:06.056
that He was the Spirit and if you have
to become the Spirit,

57:06.257 --> 57:10.967
first of all, try to give up your comforts,
lash your bodies a little bit,

57:11.167 --> 57:13.736
I’m sorry on a Christmas day I have
to say that,

57:13.936 --> 57:16.444
because He was also lashed that way.

57:16.645 --> 57:21.345
If you see on the day He was born,
for a mother to put the child

57:21.546 --> 57:27.319
in a crip that was a manger is too much
of a sacrifice.

57:29.055 --> 57:31.227
How much you want to do for your
children, you see,

57:31.428 --> 57:35.384
dress them up properly, do this, do that.

57:35.585 --> 57:40.445
But the child was to be put in a manger,
was put in a manger,

57:40.645 --> 57:49.030
just for you people to learn that comfort
crawls on the Spirit.

57:51.890 --> 57:58.299
We always seek the comfort. This one
thing is the message to all of us.

57:58.500 --> 58:04.126
If you seek your room, “I must have
a bathroom attached to that.”

58:04.327 --> 58:10.632
Again comfort. “What about my wife,
where is she going to sleep?”

58:10.832 --> 58:18.124
She’ll sleep as others are sleeping.
And you’ll sleep as others are sleeping.

58:19.601 --> 58:24.452
Nobody is going to die of that be sure,
I can assure you.

58:24.653 --> 58:27.045
Sahaj Yoga is very hard thing that way
you see,

58:27.245 --> 58:31.101
very few people die once they come
to Sahaj Yoga.

58:32.784 --> 58:38.694
Some of them should. But they don’t.

58:39.257 --> 58:41.927
They continue, they go on giving
Realization,

58:42.127 --> 58:46.507
they go on doing everything, still
they continue.

58:48.228 --> 58:55.468
Escape all the accidents, escape
all the problems and they continue.

58:57.718 --> 59:02.226
But this is a short time which must
be used.

59:02.426 --> 59:06.632
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

59:06.832 --> 59:11.067
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth,
be happy about it, sing songs,

59:11.267 --> 59:14.473
go into a mood like that, but really
I tell you,

59:14.673 --> 59:25.812
it’s a very symbolic case for all of us
to know that He slept in a manger.

59:26.282 --> 59:32.218
And the another symbolicism is that,
what did we offer Him?

59:32.905 --> 59:36.826
What did this world offer Him at that time?

59:37.027 --> 59:43.048
The another symbolicism is that they
offered Him a manger.

59:45.515 --> 59:50.372
Are we going to do the same to our Mother?

59:56.433 --> 59:59.851
This is one thing one has to know.

01:00:01.952 --> 01:00:06.861
Manger is, after all, is all right,
it doesn’t catches anything,

01:00:07.062 --> 01:00:10.966
it has no left Nabhi, right Nabhi, nothing.

01:00:11.166 --> 01:00:15.499
It doesn’t have all these problems.
There are no thorns,

01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:22.568
there’s no Agnya, there’s nobody
screwing up into Your stomach,

01:00:22.769 --> 01:00:28.124
suddenly feel, “Oh God, don’t want
to see”.

01:00:28.831 --> 01:00:36.726
So you are the thistles in that manger
which have to be soft

01:00:37.038 --> 01:00:40.351
to give comfort to Christ.

01:00:40.703 --> 01:00:49.257
You have to become so soft and so sweet,
so clean and pure,

01:00:49.458 --> 01:00:55.671
because a new babe is going to be put
in the manger.

01:00:59.347 --> 01:01:03.553
You are the kushas, is the thistle.

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:08.365
And for a yogi the kushasana is the one
who sits on the kusha only.

01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:11.167
So He was a yogi, He came on the kusha,
all right.

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:19.269
But now, what about you? To receive
Him in the manger, this is the manger.

01:01:20.093 --> 01:01:23.654
The Mother is preparing the manger

01:01:23.855 --> 01:01:32.519
to make the child feel very happy
and comforted, the thistles.

01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:43.095
Adamance, obstinacy, harshness, ugliness:

01:01:47.893 --> 01:01:51.452
all must be curbed down.

01:01:53.411 --> 01:01:57.664
It’s very symbolic, it’s very symbolic
I must say His birth;

01:01:57.864 --> 01:02:02.530
why, why, one should think, why was He
born like that?

01:02:04.882 --> 01:02:07.669
People might give any amount
of interpretations,

01:02:07.869 --> 01:02:11.382
but I know because I’ve done it.

01:02:13.742 --> 01:02:17.305
I’m trying to soften you, I’m trying
to mold you,

01:02:17.506 --> 01:02:20.640
sometimes I have to be harsh with you.

01:02:20.959 --> 01:02:26.824
Sometimes I have to be angry with you,
sometimes I have to tell you off.

01:02:27.024 --> 01:02:32.218
Just now there are some who are catching
so much on the Void,

01:02:32.419 --> 01:02:35.874
that My stomach is screwing up.

01:02:37.451 --> 01:02:41.142
It’s all right with Me, cause I’m supposed
to be that,

01:02:41.342 --> 01:02:44.773
I’m so fortunate that I have to face
all that.

01:02:44.973 --> 01:02:48.708
But what about Christ within us?

01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:55.199
You are not going to be happy
with yourself,

01:02:55.832 --> 01:02:58.804
with your being, with your Spirit,

01:02:59.004 --> 01:03:05.752
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

01:03:10.175 --> 01:03:14.328
You yourself you are not going to enjoy.

01:03:14.552 --> 01:03:19.025
You think that by justifying your egos,
by justifying your arrogance,

01:03:19.225 --> 01:03:22.565
by justifying all that you are doing
to each other -

01:03:22.765 --> 01:03:26.736
some people are busy making money
out of Sahaj Yoga, some people are busy

01:03:26.937 --> 01:03:30.333
deceiving others, some are telling lies,
some are creating problems,

01:03:30.533 --> 01:03:33.431
some are beating wives and some wives
are provocating husbands,

01:03:33.632 --> 01:03:36.769
what is all this going on?

01:03:37.408 --> 01:03:41.780
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

01:03:43.408 --> 01:03:49.819
to create the peace on earth.
We have to be peaceful!

01:03:51.025 --> 01:03:58.766
To be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

01:03:59.918 --> 01:04:04.413
If you become humble, peace will come.

01:04:04.750 --> 01:04:09.577
Humble is a good word, I don’t know
if it explains what it means.

01:04:11.060 --> 01:04:17.663
Humble means: “Not asking for your
own comfort, but comfort of others”.

01:04:19.207 --> 01:04:22.913
When others are before you,

01:04:26.551 --> 01:04:30.871
that is humility. It’s not: “Thank you
very much.”

01:04:31.072 --> 01:04:35.634
You kill somebody and then tell to the dead
person: “I’m sorry I killed you” – finished.

01:04:35.835 --> 01:04:40.728
In English language is over. Once
you have said: “I’m sorry,” finished.

01:04:40.928 --> 01:04:46.983
“Yes, I know,” and the another is “I know.”
“Why did you do it?” “I know”. Finished.

01:04:47.184 --> 01:04:54.710
If he knows, then it’s all right.
Then there’s no punishment. No.

01:04:56.810 --> 01:05:00.257
You don’t know,

01:05:01.195 --> 01:05:05.616
you are all the Spirit, so beautiful.

01:05:06.467 --> 01:05:11.069
You are to be chiseled out, all right,
that’s My job.

01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:14.247
You are to be cleaned out, that’s My job,
all right.

01:05:14.447 --> 01:05:22.679
Kundalini awakening is My job, agreed,
but maintenance is yours.

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:28.968
On the contrary sometimes I feel,

01:05:30.116 --> 01:05:34.655
because I do all this, the maintenance
is poor, very, very poor.

01:05:34.855 --> 01:05:40.312
Like in India I see some people try
to help us, by giving us money, you see.

01:05:40.512 --> 01:05:43.431
We didn’t earn the money ourselves,
you see, somebody donated money

01:05:43.632 --> 01:05:49.547
and they built some wells, all are
dilapidated and finished,

01:05:49.748 --> 01:05:56.138
free gift, nobody wants to look after it.
It’s human nature.

01:05:56.339 --> 01:05:59.993
If you don’t work hard for your
maintenance,

01:06:00.194 --> 01:06:02.416
and just leave it to Mother, “Oh,
She will cure us,

01:06:02.616 --> 01:06:06.799
let us continue what we want to do,
She’s coming after all,

01:06:06.999 --> 01:06:10.468
She’s going to look after us”,
we’ll lag behind.

01:06:10.668 --> 01:06:17.560
That’s why My presence can be sometimes
in a way not so fruitful.

01:06:17.761 --> 01:06:21.265
My presence in England

01:06:23.807 --> 01:06:27.140
is good up to a point,

01:06:27.865 --> 01:06:33.179
and afterwards it should not be there
for some time.

01:06:35.444 --> 01:06:38.105
I love you very much, you know that,
very much.

01:06:38.305 --> 01:06:42.050
I - England is My heart, and I have
to be here,

01:06:42.250 --> 01:06:46.503
and this Christmas I wanted to celebrate
with you and the New Year with you

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:51.384
just out of My own desire. But I have
to make you understand

01:06:51.585 --> 01:06:59.241
that you have to work harder and harder
to keep yourself clean.

01:07:00.427 --> 01:07:06.920
Get rid of your problems, come up,
do not say that,

01:07:07.121 --> 01:07:11.610
“Yes, it is like this Mother.” All the time
you are reporting to Me,

01:07:11.811 --> 01:07:14.158
“Still Mother I’m catching, see now
this is happening,”

01:07:14.359 --> 01:07:18.312
as if it’s a boastful thing to say.

01:07:19.541 --> 01:07:23.515
“I will get all right, I have to be
all right,

01:07:23.715 --> 01:07:28.429
now Mother has gone, let Me show Her
when I come back”.

01:07:31.741 --> 01:07:34.789
When I once went to Bombay, Raulbai
did not come to see Me

01:07:34.989 --> 01:07:38.349
for seven days and she was in Bombay,
she had arrived to see Me.

01:07:38.554 --> 01:07:42.182
So I asked them, “What’s the matter,
is she keeping all right, is she all right?

01:07:42.382 --> 01:07:47.796
Then why didn’t she come to see Me?”
I was thinking what’s the matter with her.

01:07:48.890 --> 01:07:51.890
She came to see Me after seven days.
She said, “Mother, I’m sorry

01:07:52.091 --> 01:07:54.737
I didn’t come to see You because
I was caught up this time,

01:07:54.937 --> 01:07:59.038
I wanted to cleanse myself before showing
My face to You.”

01:08:04.259 --> 01:08:09.771
So, cleansing is to be done, maintenance
is to be done,

01:08:09.971 --> 01:08:16.991
raising of the Kundalini, collectivity,
collectivity:

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:20.228
look after each other, you have to only
support Sahaj Yogis

01:08:20.429 --> 01:08:24.311
and not others, outsiders, they are
outsiders, they are not us,

01:08:24.512 --> 01:08:27.248
we are Sahaj Yogis, and those who try
to support others

01:08:27.448 --> 01:08:33.135
are no more Sahaj Yogis, they get out
of Sahaj Yoga would be better for us.

01:08:33.336 --> 01:08:37.038
Whatever we are, we are among ourselves.

01:08:37.239 --> 01:08:40.057
Outsiders are outsiders, we have to love
each other,

01:08:40.257 --> 01:08:43.193
we have to respect each other as saints.

01:08:43.393 --> 01:08:47.596
Nobody has to say anything harsh things
to each other. No.

01:08:47.797 --> 01:08:51.507
Be kind, loving, affectionate.

01:08:52.343 --> 01:08:56.756
Curb down your tongues, be humble.

01:08:56.983 --> 01:09:02.731
Humility, humility is the thing one
has to be.

01:09:02.931 --> 01:09:08.734
Write it down with big words, be humble,
be humble, be humble.

01:09:11.577 --> 01:09:18.851
And when you become humble, such peace
will reign,

01:09:21.364 --> 01:09:25.755
and you will feel so nice, being humble,
there’s nothing wrong.

01:09:25.955 --> 01:09:27.977
Christ has gone to this extent to say

01:09:28.177 --> 01:09:32.888
that somebody slaps on this face you turn
the other. Be humble.

01:09:33.088 --> 01:09:36.898
With Romans there was no other way out.

01:09:42.204 --> 01:09:46.364
There was no other way out. Also,
He preached humility,

01:09:46.564 --> 01:09:50.476
throughout He preached humility.

01:09:50.676 --> 01:09:53.189
You be humble to each other, that’s all.

01:09:53.390 --> 01:09:55.827
You need not be humble to others, because

01:09:56.028 --> 01:09:59.823
no one can now torture the saints, is over,
that situation is over,

01:10:00.024 --> 01:10:03.124
but you be humble to each other.

01:10:06.288 --> 01:10:11.476
Humble in your demands of life.

01:10:11.706 --> 01:10:14.776
That doesn’t mean that you should
become people

01:10:14.977 --> 01:10:18.758
[Aside: Just keep it there.] Just that
you become people

01:10:18.959 --> 01:10:24.411
of a strange characters, you see,

01:10:24.612 --> 01:10:30.215
that doesn’t mean that, should be
decent, with decorum,

01:10:30.416 --> 01:10:38.069
as Christ was when He was born.
But you should be humble.

01:10:38.494 --> 01:10:42.384
Try to mould your bodies, make them
lighter

01:10:42.584 --> 01:10:46.033
in the sense that you can sit anywhere,
you can move anywhere,

01:10:46.234 --> 01:10:50.921
you can lie everywhere - you are all
young people,

01:10:51.826 --> 01:10:54.710
adjust yourself.

01:10:54.977 --> 01:10:56.852
If somebody has one room you should say,

01:10:57.062 --> 01:11:00.843
“All right, doesn’t matter, I can live
in the corridor, don’t worry.”

01:11:01.129 --> 01:11:04.020
But they will be first jumping,
I’ve seen that,

01:11:04.221 --> 01:11:08.215
to the room which has the attached bath.

01:11:08.448 --> 01:11:11.177
How many of you have rooms with
attached baths, let’s see?

01:11:11.377 --> 01:11:16.171
Raise the hands, living in the ashram.

01:11:18.566 --> 01:11:24.343
Better give up. Better give up.

01:11:24.798 --> 01:11:28.091
See now? Better give up.

01:11:28.292 --> 01:11:33.117
All of you give up your rooms and stay
in rooms which are shared.

01:11:33.318 --> 01:11:36.569
Now it’s all right for you not to share
because you are husband and wife,

01:11:36.769 --> 01:11:40.218
but need not ask for attached bath.

01:11:46.467 --> 01:11:49.367
Comforts are to be given up for others,
not for you.

01:11:49.567 --> 01:11:54.413
You should make others comfortable,
not yourself.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:12:02.417
Sometimes I’m surprised at human beings
how they allow others to eat anything,

01:12:02.617 --> 01:12:07.239
the way they are self-centered is
something surprising.

01:12:07.440 --> 01:12:13.025
But after Sahaj Yoga you change!
You enjoy giving comfort to others,

01:12:13.226 --> 01:12:19.749
saying comforting words to others,
sweet things to others, you enjoy that!

01:12:20.094 --> 01:12:26.027
Christ was given the crib of a manger

01:12:26.227 --> 01:12:31.152
and He came to comfort you, to give
you peace

01:12:31.352 --> 01:12:37.736
and He came as a Saviour, can you
imagine the contrast?

01:12:37.936 --> 01:12:44.559
You are the saviours of the whole
universe now, as He was Saviour.

01:12:44.759 --> 01:12:51.289
But, you cannot be selfish, you cannot
be comfortable.

01:12:51.489 --> 01:12:53.978
You have to be like Christ, He used
to live wherever He liked:

01:12:54.178 --> 01:12:58.280
He lived in forest, He lived anywhere.

01:12:58.607 --> 01:13:05.609
Just working hard for people, He would
never even have His food sometimes.

01:13:07.769 --> 01:13:14.180
He lived under all circumstances,
under all conditions;

01:13:14.381 --> 01:13:18.952
He never asked for any comfort, nothing.

01:13:20.234 --> 01:13:24.317
He was a carpenter, He never even
used a glove.

01:13:24.517 --> 01:13:27.874
Here you must have gloves.

01:13:29.097 --> 01:13:33.113
You must have socks, you must have shoes,

01:13:33.313 --> 01:13:36.931
you must have a shaving this, He never
shaved even,

01:13:37.132 --> 01:13:40.702
that doesn’t mean you grow your beard.

01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:50.312
But He was a very clean person.

01:13:56.110 --> 01:14:02.038
He lived with the minimum of minimum, that’s
what one has to do, is to reduce things.

01:14:03.249 --> 01:14:05.756
You know, I have everything that one
can think of,

01:14:05.956 --> 01:14:11.163
but I can live with the minimum of minimum,
I can live with two saris,

01:14:11.392 --> 01:14:14.538
and sometimes with one.

01:14:15.921 --> 01:14:21.819
You should be able to live with minimum
of minimum, that’s the point is.

01:14:26.081 --> 01:14:30.218
And that is what one has to learn
from His life is

01:14:30.419 --> 01:14:34.205
that we are the saviours today,

01:14:34.406 --> 01:14:41.565
and Saviour lived just like a humble
person,

01:14:41.765 --> 01:14:47.228
very elite in His behavior, very dignified.

01:14:47.428 --> 01:14:49.888
He was not behaving like a beggar going,
“heh, heh, heh,” like that.

01:14:50.089 --> 01:14:52.977
some of them, you are like that also,
you see, you go about like this,

01:14:53.178 --> 01:14:58.062
when you talk, like this you go about,
that’s not the way!

01:14:58.263 --> 01:15:05.099
With dignity, with your magnificence,
with your gravity, move about.

01:15:05.299 --> 01:15:12.273
Actually those who are really great,
those who are the real emperors,

01:15:12.473 --> 01:15:16.799
do not need anything. Ah, what can
dominate them, tell Me?

01:15:16.999 --> 01:15:19.435
If you are the emperor of this world,

01:15:19.635 --> 01:15:21.875
if you know you are the queen
of this world,

01:15:22.076 --> 01:15:26.683
what is more important, what comfort
can dominate?

01:15:26.884 --> 01:15:33.029
What material thing can charm such
a person?

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:37.945
Because that person is above, that’s
badshah, that’s the king,

01:15:38.145 --> 01:15:44.053
that’s the real sign of a king,
king of heaven,

01:15:44.254 --> 01:15:49.431
not of England, or of any place,
but of heaven.

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:55.012
And that’s what you are, you are
the citizens of that kingdom,

01:15:55.212 --> 01:16:01.937
to you these things should be absolutely
useless.

01:16:04.333 --> 01:16:11.351
The beauty of the matter should be seen,
not the possession of it.

01:16:13.829 --> 01:16:16.245
Beauty is the comfort,

01:16:16.445 --> 01:16:20.106
not what you feel in the body, like
having comfortable things.

01:16:20.306 --> 01:16:24.944
Beauty is so comforting, people do not know

01:16:25.282 --> 01:16:28.530
how comforting is the beauty.

01:16:30.799 --> 01:16:35.914
And that I’m sure while we are celebrating
His birth today,

01:16:36.114 --> 01:16:46.066
we glorify Him, by accepting a kind
of a martyr Spirit,

01:16:46.267 --> 01:16:50.163
a Spirit in which you are dedicated,

01:16:50.804 --> 01:16:54.687
in which you do not demand anything,
but you give.

01:16:54.888 --> 01:16:57.866
You do not ask for anything, but you give.

01:16:58.067 --> 01:17:01.897
Even today I received letter from people
saying that:

01:17:02.098 --> 01:17:09.655
“Please, I want a job, can you help Me,
will You bring?”.

01:17:10.602 --> 01:17:16.562
All sort of things like that. It can be
any sort of a nonsense.

01:17:16.763 --> 01:17:19.278
Of course, I mean, one can have
all that kind of thing,

01:17:19.478 --> 01:17:25.034
but ask for one and that is the Spirit.

01:17:25.234 --> 01:17:28.507
And once you ask for that,

01:17:29.994 --> 01:17:34.864
nothing higher to what you’ve asked for.

01:17:35.065 --> 01:17:41.634
Then you don’t want anything else,
the enjoyment is complete.

01:17:41.835 --> 01:17:46.389
So to celebrate His birthday and to rejoice
in that,

01:17:46.589 --> 01:17:50.435
is to rejoice in our

01:17:52.657 --> 01:18:02.184
adequacies. If you are adequate you do not
hanker after your inadequacies, don’t you?

01:18:02.385 --> 01:18:06.499
If you are complete, if you are full,
if you are satisfied

01:18:06.699 --> 01:18:09.934
you do not hanker, do you?

01:18:10.527 --> 01:18:15.057
So enjoy your adequacies, your
completeness,

01:18:15.257 --> 01:18:25.512
your fullness, and your complete
satisfaction, enjoy that.

01:18:25.713 --> 01:18:29.116
Ultimately, all these things lead to some
sort of a satisfaction.

01:18:29.317 --> 01:18:32.724
Of course, I don’t know if you get
any satisfaction out of that,

01:18:32.924 --> 01:18:39.515
but the real satisfaction that is within
you is the Spirit, you enjoy that.

01:18:41.231 --> 01:18:47.128
This is for yourself, and for others
you are a comforter to others.

01:18:47.328 --> 01:18:50.999
It’s not that anybody who talks to you
will come and complain to Me:

01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:54.528
“Mother, he has bitten me.

01:18:55.786 --> 01:19:02.262
I had a meeting with another scorpion,
he bit me.

01:19:04.355 --> 01:19:08.770
I touched somebody and he hit me.”

01:19:11.072 --> 01:19:15.120
Comfort. You are a thing of comfort
to others,

01:19:15.321 --> 01:19:21.440
believe Me, you are. Comfort others.

01:19:24.203 --> 01:19:30.715
So those who comfort others do not
bother about their comfort.

01:19:30.916 --> 01:19:36.676
The shepherds, simple people,

01:19:36.877 --> 01:19:43.684
in this cold, imagine they were outside,
and they saw the vision of the angel.

01:19:43.885 --> 01:19:48.428
It can only be seen by people who
are humble,

01:19:48.676 --> 01:19:52.223
who are leading a humble life,

01:19:52.611 --> 01:19:58.942
He appeared to them and the another
was, vision, to the Wise.

01:20:00.578 --> 01:20:03.461
So only the humble people and the wise
people -

01:20:03.661 --> 01:20:06.313
wisdom, common sense and wisdom.

01:20:06.513 --> 01:20:10.327
Those who are not wise can never
understand, can never understand,

01:20:10.527 --> 01:20:14.921
those who are intelligent and intellectuals
are not wise people at all,

01:20:15.122 --> 01:20:20.348
they are stupid, you know that they
are stupid people.

01:20:20.754 --> 01:20:27.985
Wisdom. So the three wise men and
the shepherd is another great symbolism,

01:20:28.185 --> 01:20:35.153
those who will understand Sahaja Yoga -
simple people, shepherds.

01:20:39.088 --> 01:20:42.598
And another are the wise.

01:20:44.395 --> 01:20:50.559
Only the wise can understand the star.

01:20:54.409 --> 01:20:57.661
So many must have seen the star.

01:20:59.337 --> 01:21:01.689
Wise men from the East. It’s true.

01:21:01.890 --> 01:21:05.934
Eastern people are much more wiser
than other people, no doubt about it.

01:21:06.134 --> 01:21:09.753
But why? Let’s see why they are wiser.

01:21:09.953 --> 01:21:16.637
Eastern are wiser, up to a point.

01:21:21.691 --> 01:21:26.684
In your body, there is East and West
if you see.

01:21:27.191 --> 01:21:35.669
East is left side and West is right side.

01:21:36.286 --> 01:21:45.247
Eastern are the left sided, nearer
the heart.

01:21:45.661 --> 01:21:49.421
But not the Eastern most are Japanese,
horrible people,

01:21:49.622 --> 01:21:55.796
Japanese, horrible, then the - all these
people who are selling you

01:21:55.997 --> 01:21:59.125
these drugs and all that, they are
worst of all.

01:21:59.325 --> 01:22:04.600
But those who know and are left-sided,

01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:15.308
the combination of knowledge and love,
knowledge and compassion.

01:22:15.509 --> 01:22:19.542
If there is no love, if there is
no compassion,

01:22:19.742 --> 01:22:26.922
I mean you, just can’t talk to that
person. He’s like a stick!

01:22:27.122 --> 01:22:31.470
I mean, in a dried stick what vibrations
can I give, you just tell Me?

01:22:31.671 --> 01:22:36.825
A dried stick, straightforward dried stick,
you see.

01:22:37.230 --> 01:22:39.520
What vibrations I can give to a dried
stick?

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:49.814
There should be some sort of a greenery
in it, isn’t it? Little bit at least.

01:22:50.015 --> 01:22:54.732
If it is too much of water also it is
spoiled, can be rotten.

01:22:54.932 --> 01:23:02.312
But if it is a dry stick straightforward,
you know what I mean, dry sticks are -

01:23:02.479 --> 01:23:04.808
then how can you give vibrations
to such a person?

01:23:05.008 --> 01:23:07.208
You cannot. You cannot raise such a person.

01:23:07.409 --> 01:23:12.762
So, first thing is love, and wisdom
comes through love.

01:23:13.290 --> 01:23:19.169
Wisdom doesn’t come through intelligence,
it comes through love.

01:23:19.377 --> 01:23:25.866
When you love someone, you get the light
of wisdom.

01:23:26.067 --> 01:23:28.827
By thinking you can never become wise,
you can become stupid,

01:23:29.028 --> 01:23:36.026
absolutely stupid, but by loving you can
become very wise.

01:23:36.227 --> 01:23:39.600
Then I see Sahaj Yogis suddenly they
say some things extremely wise,

01:23:39.801 --> 01:23:44.036
something great, suddenly say something
that’s so sweet

01:23:44.237 --> 01:23:48.210
and so nice, I said: “That’s it, the heart
has opened out”.

01:23:48.411 --> 01:23:51.187
The fragrance of wisdom comes from
the heart

01:23:51.387 --> 01:23:55.555
and that is symbolic now, that three
of them came,

01:23:55.755 --> 01:24:00.036
and they were who? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

01:24:03.285 --> 01:24:08.403
They came to see Christ – Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

01:24:12.509 --> 01:24:15.504
See the vibrations.

01:24:25.062 --> 01:24:28.965
Because They only can recognize,

01:24:32.051 --> 01:24:38.786
not ordinary people, Romans, no.

01:24:42.529 --> 01:24:45.442
So They came.

01:24:45.808 --> 01:24:50.676
So we have to be humble and we have
to be wise.

01:24:51.434 --> 01:24:57.645
Wisdom is such a, such a diamond,

01:24:57.846 --> 01:25:01.673
it has so many facets that I cannot
describe to you in a short time,

01:25:01.874 --> 01:25:04.989
one day I’ll talk about wisdom.

01:25:06.495 --> 01:25:11.472
But it’s all common sense, so sweet,
so beautiful,

01:25:11.672 --> 01:25:15.233
where to say what, how to change
the subject,

01:25:15.433 --> 01:25:23.448
where to assert more, where to handle
a situation in a strong way,

01:25:23.648 --> 01:25:32.403
is to, where to be a gentleman and where
to be uncouth,

01:25:33.475 --> 01:25:38.573
where to shout at people and where to be
quiet and humble and sweet.

01:25:38.774 --> 01:25:43.184
All such a judgment you see, is all
that is wisdom, you see.

01:25:43.574 --> 01:25:46.951
Is a center of gravity,

01:25:47.151 --> 01:25:50.510
and to achieve that you have to give up
your extreme behavior.

01:25:50.710 --> 01:25:57.856
Obstinacy is the first thing that should be
given up, for all wisdom, obstinacy.

01:26:06.377 --> 01:26:09.098
To have a son like Christ was such
a great boon

01:26:09.298 --> 01:26:16.491
I mean, so confident You know, feel,
“adhara”, the complete rapport is there,

01:26:16.692 --> 01:26:22.411
no problem of any kind, to have a son
like Him,

01:26:23.636 --> 01:26:28.794
completely obedient, absolutely 100%
obedience and humility

01:26:28.995 --> 01:26:33.945
and understanding of Your Being.

01:26:36.562 --> 01:26:39.692
No problems.

01:26:41.757 --> 01:26:45.951
You are all My sons too, and made
after Him,

01:26:46.152 --> 01:26:50.536
after the same pattern as I made Christ.

01:26:51.129 --> 01:26:55.872
I’m proud of you, you are My children,

01:26:56.484 --> 01:27:02.255
come up to it, and you have an example
already created for you.

01:27:04.436 --> 01:27:08.929
Before you is Christ, you see Him,
what a support it was,

01:27:09.130 --> 01:27:12.232
I never had any complaints of any kind,
no upset,

01:27:12.432 --> 01:27:16.452
He would never be upset, no question!

01:27:16.652 --> 01:27:18.090
He would never tell Me, “I’m upset,” never,

01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:25.442
this word doesn’t exist in the dictionary
of wise.

01:27:29.484 --> 01:27:35.114
You are never - how can you be upset,
when you are set once for all?

01:27:37.585 --> 01:27:41.187
This word must go from the dictionary
of many Sahaj Yogis who use it,

01:27:41.388 --> 01:27:44.619
problems and upset.

01:27:49.193 --> 01:27:52.963
You solve the problem, give the solutions.

01:27:53.164 --> 01:27:57.153
No problems, only solutions.

01:28:00.848 --> 01:28:04.364
That’s the way a son should be to a mother,

01:28:04.564 --> 01:28:10.341
that she can depend on him, absolutely,
no problems there, nothing,

01:28:10.541 --> 01:28:16.395
I mean, you have a son born like Christ,
what is there to worry about anything?

01:28:19.851 --> 01:28:28.965
Even the one word He said: “Behold
the Mother”, is a mantra,

01:28:29.166 --> 01:28:34.356
is the greatest mantra that I use.

01:28:35.164 --> 01:28:39.830
When your attention is here and there,
I just say that mantra to you,

01:28:40.030 --> 01:28:47.451
as a command it is! And so humble,
so confident: “Behold”.

01:28:47.651 --> 01:28:53.669
“Behold” doesn’t mean look, no, it’s a very
humble way of addressing,

01:28:53.869 --> 01:28:56.804
‘behold,’ it’s something glorious,
something great,

01:28:57.004 --> 01:29:01.343
behold it, accept it, understand.

01:29:01.543 --> 01:29:05.245
It was such a mutual understanding
of support and love

01:29:05.445 --> 01:29:08.559
that should exist between us.

01:29:09.276 --> 01:29:14.887
No secretiveness, no formalities,
no exclusiveness.

01:29:17.662 --> 01:29:20.460
No exclusiveness, all enjoyments must
be together.

01:29:20.661 --> 01:29:26.929
Now all your ideas of having separate
enjoyments

01:29:27.130 --> 01:29:30.846
must be given up for a change.

01:29:31.046 --> 01:29:38.852
Holiday is when you are in the company
of your, no more holidays, Sahaj Yogis.

01:29:39.053 --> 01:29:41.569
All these things must be given up.

01:29:41.769 --> 01:29:45.569
This is all against Christ’s behavior.

01:29:45.769 --> 01:29:50.122
He never had a holiday, never.

01:29:53.520 --> 01:29:56.692
This is holidaying.

01:30:00.162 --> 01:30:03.905
Holiday comes from the word holy day.

01:30:04.105 --> 01:30:08.214
Every day that is spent, every minute
that is spent

01:30:08.415 --> 01:30:13.569
in the company of Christ is a holy day.

01:30:16.425 --> 01:30:17.619
So they must have brought it down,

01:30:17.819 --> 01:30:26.866
Christ to Spirit and Spirit to spirits
and spirits to other things. I’m sure.

01:30:27.066 --> 01:30:34.493
I mean, that way, human beings are very
great at deriving at right points, you see,

01:30:34.693 --> 01:30:37.394
and jumping into ditches directly.

01:30:37.594 --> 01:30:42.018
So they must have done it so sweetly,
beautifully,

01:30:42.218 --> 01:30:51.401
that’s what it is wisdom, wisdom,
all the time, wisdom.

01:30:51.601 --> 01:30:58.374
Wise man is never cunning, never sharp.
Is something I cannot describe also.

01:30:58.574 --> 01:31:03.274
And who is the wisest of all is Shri
Ganesha, who is the embodiment of wisdom.

01:31:03.474 --> 01:31:06.211
Ask Him for wisdom.

01:31:06.412 --> 01:31:11.653
He gives you the wisdom to do anything,
ask Him for wisdom.

01:31:13.173 --> 01:31:17.638
Today I just think of how many Christmas
I must have passed,

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:20.350
I’ve never talked about Christ so much,

01:31:20.551 --> 01:31:25.889
with that intimacy. Such a relationship,

01:31:26.090 --> 01:31:34.453
such a relationship of, so near and
so far - because He knew who I was.

01:31:36.148 --> 01:31:41.560
That awe, that respect, that humility,

01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:47.311
is hard to find in any disciple, even
in a disciple, in your own son!

01:31:47.512 --> 01:31:52.176
Is so close, but complete understanding.

01:31:55.715 --> 01:32:01.266
That oneness has to be developed.

01:32:01.466 --> 01:32:05.006
Gradually we are all developing it, I know,

01:32:05.206 --> 01:32:08.791
but these are the days of speed and
we have to speed up a little more

01:32:08.991 --> 01:32:11.942
in the right direction.

01:32:13.122 --> 01:32:19.643
So now, as desired by you, we have
a white Christmas outside.

01:32:19.844 --> 01:32:21.228
[Some yogis say: “Jai Shri Mataji”].

01:32:21.429 --> 01:32:29.403
Then as you have desired that “Wash me
and I shall be whiter than snow”

01:32:30.619 --> 01:32:33.598
is been blessed,

01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:40.455
think of all the nice things we have
done together

01:32:40.656 --> 01:32:45.374
and that we are going together to do it
later on:

01:32:45.575 --> 01:32:49.107
that’s how you solve your past and future
problem.

01:32:49.308 --> 01:32:55.551
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

01:32:55.785 --> 01:32:59.932
So Christ who is the present Christ,

01:33:00.817 --> 01:33:07.457
today, who is born in you, is to be
looked after.

01:33:08.166 --> 01:33:13.312
He’s not the Christ of the Bible, but
the Christ of your heart,

01:33:13.513 --> 01:33:18.036
which is born within you is to be
looked after.

01:33:21.190 --> 01:33:26.949
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

01:33:27.150 --> 01:33:31.693
for people to understand it,
it’s too symbolic.

01:33:31.893 --> 01:33:40.122
But at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand.

01:33:41.357 --> 01:33:44.663
So one has to only understand through
your own Spirit,

01:33:44.864 --> 01:33:50.306
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

01:33:50.506 --> 01:33:55.723
Put Him in a very soft heart, if you
have thistles,

01:33:57.083 --> 01:33:59.864
He’s a collective being.

01:34:00.064 --> 01:34:08.411
If you affect the collectivity,
then He’s affected. Look after Him.

01:34:12.971 --> 01:34:17.921
So they say Merry Christmas is enjoyment
for joy.

01:34:18.122 --> 01:34:23.301
Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy,
happiness.

01:34:23.501 --> 01:34:28.811
I wish peace for the whole world,
for the whole nations,

01:34:29.012 --> 01:34:33.250
to understand to give up all the strives,

01:34:33.450 --> 01:34:40.028
all the false battles, for money and
for power,

01:34:40.805 --> 01:34:46.145
all wrong ideas that they are different
from each other,

01:34:46.346 --> 01:34:51.842
and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

01:34:52.042 --> 01:34:56.747
and enter into the Kingdom of God,

01:34:57.512 --> 01:35:02.494
where they are invited with all respect
and love.

01:35:02.694 --> 01:35:06.620
I wish peace to all of them, to all
the countries,

01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:15.958
all the human beings, in their families,
in their hearts, with their children.

01:35:17.912 --> 01:35:26.475
With all of them, let there be peace,
let their heart emit peace,

01:35:26.676 --> 01:35:36.403
their tongues speak with peace,
their eyes see nothing but peace.

01:35:40.523 --> 01:35:45.664
All this has to change, tremendous change
has to take place,

01:35:45.864 --> 01:35:49.468
the whole universe has to take
a different turn.

01:35:49.668 --> 01:35:55.138
All that is hatred, hateful, ugly,
has to vanish,

01:35:55.338 --> 01:35:59.483
and the peace has to prevail, which is
not the peace of the dead

01:35:59.684 --> 01:36:05.153
but peace of the living, that has to come,
of the wise.

01:36:05.874 --> 01:36:10.059
I bless all of you to be the channels
of that peace,

01:36:10.260 --> 01:36:16.584
to be beautiful channels of that peace,
to be glorious channels of that peace,

01:36:16.784 --> 01:36:23.369
to be great children of your Mother,
who is so proud of you.

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:26.567
May God bless you.

01:37:48.682 --> 01:37:50.379
There’s a mantra for the Goddess:

01:37:50.579 --> 01:37:55.093
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita":

01:37:55.294 --> 01:38:01.936
Oh Goddess who resides through all
this creation created,

01:38:02.137 --> 01:38:06.635
all that is created, as peace.

01:38:07.478 --> 01:38:13.749
So you have to seek peace that is
your Mother.

01:38:16.192 --> 01:38:22.255
We all say that mantra. Gavin, you say it:

01:38:22.456 --> 01:38:25.834
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

01:38:26.035 --> 01:38:28.877
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:38:29.058 --> 01:38:35.346
You say it once and then they should
say it thrice. It’s a prayer.

01:38:35.547 --> 01:38:42.006
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

01:38:42.207 --> 01:38:49.631
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:38:49.832 --> 01:38:56.680
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

01:38:56.881 --> 01:39:03.923
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:39:04.124 --> 01:39:10.527
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

01:39:10.743 --> 01:39:18.271
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:39:28.335 --> 01:39:33.971
And then another one is kshama rupena
samsthita, this is the mantra  because

01:39:34.172 --> 01:39:38.707
the peace can come only through
humility and forgiveness, “kshama”.

01:39:38.908 --> 01:39:44.532
That’s why Christ is kshama. You say
that for Christ.

01:39:44.812 --> 01:39:50.973
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

01:39:51.174 --> 01:39:57.426
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:39:57.627 --> 01:40:03.756
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

01:40:03.957 --> 01:40:09.564
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:40:09.765 --> 01:40:15.702
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

01:40:15.903 --> 01:40:23.022
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:40:31.149 --> 01:40:35.009
Despite that, Agnyas are catching.

01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:41.653
Now can you take out Agnya? Those
who are feeling hurt,

01:40:41.854 --> 01:40:45.934
please give up your Agnyas now,
can you put your finger

01:40:46.181 --> 01:40:52.570
here for Agnya? Here. Good for the Jews.

01:41:26.448 --> 01:41:29.611
Hmm. Better?

01:41:47.159 --> 01:41:50.736
So now all this is too much for Christmas,

01:41:50.937 --> 01:41:53.694
at the most you can wash My hands
and this and that,

01:41:53.895 --> 01:41:58.007
you can sing something and you can
have little puja, that’s all.

01:41:58.208 --> 01:42:00.089
For Me the puja is over, if you can get a…

01:42:00.290 --> 01:42:04.605
you could just wash My hands
[and that’s it? Not clearly audible].

01:42:14.379 --> 01:42:20.947
Now. All these presents are to be
opened near the tree or something,

01:42:21.148 --> 01:42:25.463
this is the tree, tree of life. Present.

01:42:25.664 --> 01:42:28.460
Is giver of everything, giver of all
the gifts,

01:42:28.661 --> 01:42:32.344
is this tree of life, is the Kundalini,

01:42:32.545 --> 01:42:35.998
so symbolic, you see? So symbolic.

01:42:36.199 --> 01:42:41.368
The egg of Easter, this tree of, I mean
it’s so symbolic.

01:42:41.569 --> 01:42:46.484
I wish your Kundalinis were as beautiful
as that tree.

01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:53.755
Giver of all the gifts.

01:42:55.129 --> 01:42:59.006
Is called as Kalpataru, in Sanskrit.

01:43:01.047 --> 01:43:05.343
Alright, so, we can do that washing…
Gavin: Just getting water.

01:43:05.544 --> 01:43:10.159
Shri Mataji: Of the hands.
Sahaja Yogi: He’s just bringing the water.

01:43:10.389 --> 01:43:13.652
Shri Mataji: Is there a towel, or…?

01:43:17.665 --> 01:43:20.310
Shri Mataji: … way, isn’t it?

01:43:20.516 --> 01:43:23.956
I mean, if you tell somebody “Don’t put
your fingers there”, they won’t listen.

01:43:24.157 --> 01:43:30.467
But once it is burnt, then they know,
wisdom comes in, through experience.

01:43:30.668 --> 01:43:35.226
But now [they don’t have?] innate.
[Unclear]

01:43:40.430 --> 01:43:44.176
[Aside to Gavin] Yes, just wash first
of all.

01:43:59.178 --> 01:44:03.725
Look at that. Hm. Ganges.

01:44:03.926 --> 01:44:07.625
River Thames has behaved so far,
so far.

01:44:07.826 --> 01:44:12.319
I hope so, she behaves even when
I go away.

01:44:12.700 --> 01:44:17.112
Should we put it somewhere?
[Yogi: Put it in that…]

01:44:17.313 --> 01:44:23.402
She was very furious, you know?
Very furious she was.

01:44:24.794 --> 01:44:33.857
She is a standing danger. I must say.
For the sinful, be careful.

01:44:36.359 --> 01:44:40.739
All the polish of the house and everything
like that .

01:44:40.940 --> 01:44:45.554
Today I was polishing symbolically.

01:44:46.120 --> 01:44:51.971
Ah, now. First of all we’ll wash and then
we’ll do it, all right?

01:44:53.008 --> 01:44:59.471
All right. Bring it, the… no, I think
I’ll have now the ghee.

01:45:04.853 --> 01:45:08.212
Should take this quite a lot, keep it
with them

01:45:08.413 --> 01:45:13.748
and take it at least seven days,
as a medicine. This is very good.

01:45:13.949 --> 01:45:19.269
For all those who have Void problems,
specially for [voiders?].

01:45:25.316 --> 01:45:30.949
Linda, I’ll have time now, once this is
over then you can come and see Me,

01:45:31.150 --> 01:45:34.516
and then we’ll discuss about other things,
all right?

01:45:36.249 --> 01:45:40.514
Now, what should we do?
Gavin: He’s just getting ghee now.

01:45:40.873 --> 01:45:43.233
It’s been warmed.

01:45:49.837 --> 01:45:51.791
Shri Mataji: You don’t have anything
for Aarti and all that,

01:45:51.992 --> 01:45:55.015
I’ll bring this time when I go there.

01:45:56.508 --> 01:46:00.742
If I save some money. Yes.

01:46:01.592 --> 01:46:06.357
You know, the letter was not shown
to Modi.

01:46:11.120 --> 01:46:14.376
Letter you give up.

01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:38.058
This is ghee?
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

01:46:38.259 --> 01:46:43.242
Shri Mataji: This is ghee! So much!
Out of proportion it is, I mean.

01:46:43.443 --> 01:46:46.888
It’s too much softening.

01:46:49.319 --> 01:46:54.085
All right, give Me little bit now, some.
Just a wee bit.

01:46:54.286 --> 01:46:59.290
As it is you all have liver, so you don’t
need ghee.

01:47:02.323 --> 01:47:04.644
It’s all right.

01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:09.904
Now pour some water.

01:47:14.722 --> 01:47:18.834
Good for cleaning the nose of all
the people who have sinus…

01:47:19.035 --> 01:47:23.463
the ghee, but not for eating, eh?

01:47:35.143 --> 01:47:38.827
Now. Little bit now of another thing,
whatever it is.

01:47:54.868 --> 01:47:57.719
Put the whole thing.

01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:07.127
Again some water.

01:48:19.841 --> 01:48:22.032
Now.

01:48:25.594 --> 01:48:28.858
Milk has to be more. Madhu,
madhu,

01:48:29.059 --> 01:48:32.305
you get madhu first, madhu means…

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:36.245
Milk will be more than this. Yes.

01:49:03.274 --> 01:49:06.443
Gavin: Shall I put milk next?

01:49:06.644 --> 01:49:10.559
Shri Mataji: Yes, milk, then. And more
milk than…

01:49:16.186 --> 01:49:20.404
Gavin: …sugar.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:49:31.618 --> 01:49:34.719
Milk. Need for more milk, I think.

01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:59.173
More. Here.

01:50:01.526 --> 01:50:04.534
Yes, it’s all right.

01:50:20.992 --> 01:50:23.994
Not too much sugar.

01:50:45.247 --> 01:50:49.115
Not to feel guilty, for Heaven’s sake.

01:50:51.172 --> 01:50:54.956
Not to feel guilty at all, left -
left Vishuddhi catching.

01:50:55.157 --> 01:50:58.510
Don’t think! In My presence you are
not supposed to think at all.

01:50:58.711 --> 01:51:03.593
Just don’t think. Don’t feel guilty.

01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:10.965
Catching, still.
[Aside] Good, thank you.

01:51:18.414 --> 01:51:22.193
Yogi: She’s posing!
Shri Mataji: She’s posing!

01:51:32.520 --> 01:51:38.355
Look at her. Wrapped up in the sari.

01:51:39.444 --> 01:51:42.392
Fitting in great, herself [unclear].

01:51:43.306 --> 01:51:46.659
Gavin: Just matches her eyes.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:51:46.860 --> 01:51:52.226
Gavin: The sari just matches her eyes.
Shri Mataji: You see? Just see [indistinct].

01:51:55.260 --> 01:51:58.720
It’s a dignified thing, you know,
sari is very dignified.

01:51:58.921 --> 01:52:02.446
Now. All right.

01:52:22.652 --> 01:52:27.209
Very nice people. Very sensible.

01:52:31.901 --> 01:52:36.091
Gavin, in your list you must put this also.

01:52:37.958 --> 01:52:42.537
If you tell this list to Me, there,
who is coming gives you.

01:52:42.738 --> 01:52:46.336
Who are coming to India out of you?

01:52:49.948 --> 01:52:52.214
Here?

01:53:01.262 --> 01:53:06.354
Now, those who are coming should
get this list

01:53:06.555 --> 01:53:13.130
of a few things that you need,
essential ones.

01:53:13.331 --> 01:53:18.127
I don’t find that thing with which you used
to give Me water, is it here or not?

01:53:18.328 --> 01:53:20.624
With the spoon and all that.

01:53:20.825 --> 01:53:22.959
Gavin: I must check it with Marcus
afterwards. Shri Mataji: Marcus?

01:53:23.160 --> 01:53:25.668
Marcus: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You’ve got that spoon and…

01:53:25.869 --> 01:53:28.948
Marcus: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: That
you have got. Marcus: Yes.

01:53:30.094 --> 01:53:34.715
Shri Mataji: All right [speaks aside in a
low voice. Sounds like: there’s the spoon].

01:53:46.281 --> 01:53:51.019
This one is very good because it is not
hard wood.

01:55:50.938 --> 01:55:54.432
Yogi: Christmas… [indistinct].

01:56:18.906 --> 01:56:25.797
Shri Mataji: Now, just put some red
on my hand. Red [Kumkum? Unclear]

01:56:30.781 --> 01:56:35.633
Shri Mataji: I will. Gavin: Our Mother,
You are the Counsellor

01:56:35.834 --> 01:56:40.291
who was promised by Christ.
Shri Mataji: I am.

01:56:40.492 --> 01:56:44.646
Gavin: You make us become our
own knowledge.

01:56:47.647 --> 01:56:52.742
Our Mother, You are the Redeemer,
who was promised by Christ.

01:56:54.340 --> 01:56:57.763
You have given us our second birth.

01:57:00.985 --> 01:57:08.352
Our Mother, You are the fulfillment
of every prophecy and every prayer.

01:57:10.720 --> 01:57:13.510
Our Mother, You are the wholesomeness,

01:57:13.711 --> 01:57:17.984
by which all wrongs are cleansed.

01:57:21.238 --> 01:57:25.426
Our Mother, You are the right
discrimination

01:57:25.627 --> 01:57:30.021
by which we have received enlightenment.

01:57:33.396 --> 01:57:36.585
Our Mother, You are the integration,

01:57:36.786 --> 01:57:42.049
by You God’s whole creation has been
threaded together.

01:57:47.558 --> 01:57:51.653
We bow to You who are auspiciousness;

01:57:56.527 --> 01:57:59.980
we praise You who are Love;

01:58:02.339 --> 01:58:06.873
we give thanks to You who are compassion;

01:58:08.993 --> 01:58:18.964
we prostrate before You who are all-knowing,
all-seeing and all-forgiving.

01:58:20.860 --> 01:58:23.699
We are Your children:

01:58:25.614 --> 01:58:29.175
let us never be separated from You,

01:58:29.376 --> 01:58:35.014
whether by Your illusion, or by our
own limitations.

01:58:36.967 --> 01:58:40.424
Give us strength of Spirit

01:58:43.735 --> 01:58:50.146
and to the world give peace. Aum.

01:58:51.180 --> 01:58:53.644
Yogis: Amen.

01:59:20.778 --> 01:59:26.929
Shri Mataji: Let your life be fragrant
by My blessings,

01:59:30.693 --> 01:59:33.564
by My love,

01:59:36.532 --> 01:59:39.888
by My concern,

01:59:40.699 --> 01:59:44.605
and the pride that I have for you all.

02:00:11.387 --> 02:00:14.216
May God bless you.

02:00:20.343 --> 02:00:24.020
Yogini: … and it’s called “Mother God”.
Shri Mataji: Who?

02:00:24.221 --> 02:00:29.934
Yogini: It’s called “Mother God”. Shri
Mataji: “Mother God”. Yogini: “Mother God”.

02:03:33.590 --> 02:03:35.844
Shri Mataji: Oh.

02:03:55.572 --> 02:04:01.389
Sang [you?] with such a heart. Everybody
was, everybody’s heart was singing with you.

02:04:01.590 --> 02:04:05.994
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

02:04:12.626 --> 02:04:15.259
These songs should be recorded
and should be sent to India.

02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:19.890
They would be very happy, you see,
to have these songs.

02:04:28.865 --> 02:04:31.094
Very beautiful. Who wrote it?
Yogini: Hugo wrote it, Mother.

02:04:31.335 --> 02:04:34.343
Shri Mataji: Eh? Yogini: Hugo wrote it.
Shri Mataji: Hugo. Yogini: Hugo did that.

02:04:34.544 --> 02:04:38.432
Shri Mataji: Congratulations.
Give him a hand.

02:04:53.897 --> 02:04:56.659
Beautiful.

02:04:57.596 --> 02:04:59.886
Integration is so important, you see.

02:05:00.087 --> 02:05:02.705
Somebody has to write, somebody
has to compose,

02:05:02.906 --> 02:05:06.491
somebody has to sing and somebody
has to listen.
