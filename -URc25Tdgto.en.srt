1
00:00:01,810 --> 00:00:10,900
The purpose of these marriages is this, that 
we should have international understanding

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:22,490
about human beings that after coming to Sahaja 
Yoga we transcend all the barriers, all the

3
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:31,460
barriers of race, religion, ?? and nationality.

4
00:00:31,460 --> 00:00:45,480
We have to create this homogenous world and 
make it peaceful by removing this disease

5
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:51,700
of national identification or racial identification.

6
00:00:51,700 --> 00:00:56,410
We are all created by God Almighty.

7
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,570
Our differences are only skin deep.

8
00:00:58,570 --> 00:01:06,039
Culturally we are different little bit here 
and there but basically in ourselves we are

9
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:07,039
all spiritual.

10
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:23,619
And the religion that you have is innate built 
in within us which is an part and parcel of

11
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:24,619
us.

12
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:32,189
By these marriages we want to achieve a very 
happy and a very enjoyable married life.

13
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:42,560
In the marriage one has to know, nobody should 
dominate anyone… that’s a wrong idea.

14
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:50,000
But we have two wheels of the chariot, one 
is big and one is small, then the chariot

15
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,420
will never move forward, it will go round 
and round.

16
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:02,439
Both are equally the same, equal sized, but 
they are not similar.

17
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:06,759
The left cannot be the right and the right 
cannot be the left.

18
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,099
So men and women have to be men and women 
in Sahaja Yoga.

19
00:02:12,099 --> 00:02:15,420
They cannot be unisex people.

20
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,420
They cannot be.

21
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,620
That’s very important.

22
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:22,540
The man has to protect the wife, love her, 
give her all the security that is needed.

23
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:29,010
And woman has to nourish the husband and give 
him all the love and affection she has.

24
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:37,239
So here we are on the threshold of entering 
into a new life where you have a companion

25
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:38,820
of your own.

26
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:42,390
She will be your wife.

27
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,989
Not because only she is in Sahaja Yoga that 
you have married her but she’s your own.

28
00:02:48,989 --> 00:02:57,870
So try to prove it to her that you love her 
very much and that she is your wife and you

29
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:00,829
have all that is yours is for her.

30
00:03:00,829 --> 00:03:04,260
This is very important in the very beginning 
of it.

31
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:10,599
Now there’s another thing I have found out 
in my experience sometimes that they get married,

32
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:16,160
I don’t know what happens, they are swayed 
into it and they get married.

33
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:19,549
And after they go back to their own country 
they start saying “Mother we know we cannot

34
00:03:19,549 --> 00:03:21,970
manage, we have to work it out.

35
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:25,390
This, that” Marriages are now worked out.

36
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,850
Spontaneously it happens.

37
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:31,900
But in India you see we are all the time prepared 
for a good married life.

38
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,459
The wife is told, the husband is told all 
the time.

39
00:03:33,459 --> 00:03:35,819
So normally when they get married they think 
this is what it is for us.

40
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,880
They don’t have love affairs before hand; 
they don’t have friends and things.

41
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:44,500
But even if you had your past, now it’s 
finished.

42
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,030
You don’t discuss, don’t tell, don’t 
talk about it, do your best.

43
00:03:52,030 --> 00:04:02,569
That’s absolutely wrong because the past 
doesn’t exist, what exists is the present.

44
00:04:02,569 --> 00:04:05,709
So enjoy the present, forget it, forgive yourself.

45
00:04:05,709 --> 00:04:12,359
Many people also have this big problem that 
they cannot forget their past and go on telling

46
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,049
their wives that I was like this.

47
00:04:15,049 --> 00:04:17,020
There is no need to confess anything.

48
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,419
They think it is honest.

49
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:29,880
There is no question of honesty or dishonesty 
at that time is but to enjoy full joyous mood

50
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,190
of marriage.

51
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:33,880
That’s in the head.

52
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,380
Otherwise what’s the use of marrying and 
then telling stories.

53
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:42,690
Or some people have very bad habit of telling 
him how bad the mother was, the father was

54
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:48,320
or may be that how miserable he is or how 
he has gone through struggle… there’s

55
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,490
no need to talk of this.

56
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:54,120
At this moment you are married, she is your 
wife, and you have to express all your love

57
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:05,960
and all your attention to her so she feels 
secure and happy.

58
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,770
This point please try to note.

59
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,350
Nothing has to be talked about your past.

60
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:13,000
Then we are Sahaja Yogis.

61
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:21,479
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis, very great 
Sahaja Yogis who are married, very very ordinary

62
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:24,660
men, very ordinary, ordinary looking superficially.

63
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:28,449
Or can say some of them could be called as 
ugly.

64
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:34,270
Some girls are like that, some men are like 
that.

65
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:40,199
I mean from these norms that you have about 
beauty and all this nonsense.

66
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:48,220
But when you see a person full of vibrations, 
she gives you such tranquility, such joy.

67
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:55,449
Don’t disturb it by having your pre-married 
ideas about your wife you see.

68
00:05:55,449 --> 00:06:02,070
The reality is this is your wife and you are 
her husband.

69
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:05,490
Take the reality into consideration.

70
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,650
Not some imaginary image you have about your 
wife.

71
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:10,910
Your wife is before you, she’s your wife.

72
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,810
What’s the use of having imaginary ideas 
you will never enjoy your married life, I

73
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:21,610
mean if you have imagination, then you should 
not even marry: marry your imagination is

74
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,370
a better way.

75
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:26,250
Why to ruin somebody’s life, why to make 
somebody miserable?

76
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:32,449
They are all intelligent and good Sahaja yoginis.

77
00:06:32,449 --> 00:06:39,250
We have seen to it they are all very good 
Sahaja Yoginis.

78
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:44,600
But once you try to misbehave with your wife 
or try to create problems for us, naturally

79
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:50,340
we don’t want you any more in Sahaja Yoga, 
because it is getting too much and you know

80
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,750
as it is not easy to marry you, to get your 
visas, to take you down there its quite a

81
00:06:56,750 --> 00:07:00,610
lot of work one has to go into it.

82
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:07,340
So now don’t think that you have been forced 
into any marriage, you have been asked into

83
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,780
any marriage, please.

84
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:23,680
If you give up this kind of an imaginary ideas 
about this marriage, again and again I am

85
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,290
telling to you today now and this time also, 
this present moment, all those who feel that

86
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,599
way should immediately tell me, I will be 
extremely happy.

87
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,900
There is another third thing that I have seen 
about the western people is that they are

88
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,900
literally frightened of marriage, literally 
frightened.

89
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:45,509
First is they may live with a woman for 10 
days or 20 days or 10 years, but as soon as

90
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:53,979
they get married they go for a divorce, very 
funny(??).

91
00:07:53,979 --> 00:08:03,069
For this I think the law is responsible, because 
the women think they will get money out of

92
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:10,039
their husbands may be or the husbands think 
that they will get money out of their wives.

93
00:08:10,039 --> 00:08:29,220
In Sahaja Yoga if you want to take the divorce 
later on, which I don’t like at all.

94
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,979
We have only 1 % divorces, then I would not 
allow you to extract money from the other,

95
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:39,180
never, and nor the girl should extract money 
from you.

96
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:52,980
Last but not the least is important that, 
once you are married, now the girls may not

97
00:08:52,980 --> 00:09:02,670
be able to go immediately from their various 
places because of visa problems, but don’t

98
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:13,190
give them money to be sent to their families, 
that is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

99
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:19,940
The girl should not send their money to their 
parents that’s not allowed and trouble the

100
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,570
husband for that.

101
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:27,100
Sometimes if you want to send is alright, 
but there should not be regular remittance

102
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:35,890
all the time and this is sometimes comes to 
my notice which I do not want to encourage.

103
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:45,300
As far as that part is concerned you should 
not give any money for sending it to the relations

104
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:57,510
of your wife otherwise it will become a money 
oriented marriage and people would marry because

105
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,510
they can extract some money from it.

106
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,510
All these things should be kept in to it, 
that we are now married, we are stupid if

107
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:13,339
we want to have a divorce, stupid. and I don’t 
like divorce at all.

108
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:21,389
Though I allow because sometimes I find horrible 
things happening.

109
00:10:21,389 --> 00:10:33,160
But rarely I would allow anybody to have a 
divorce, rarely, so this idea should be given

110
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,720
up and one should not be selfish…

111
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:42,339
But from the very beginning if you try to 
be very kind and nice, I am sure things will

112
00:10:42,339 --> 00:10:43,339
work out.

113
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:53,200
We have to prove to the world that marriage 
is a divine institution and by this divine

114
00:10:53,200 --> 00:11:00,260
institution if you have been put together 
it’s also a divine plan.

115
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:03,700
And through this divine plan many things are 
going to work out.

116
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,350
So those who are getting married today are 
helping Sahaja Yoga very much.

117
00:11:06,350 --> 00:11:13,279
I have already told you there are many saints 
who want to be married.

118
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:16,360
And nowadays that you see this world full 
of horrible people.

119
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:34,500
We need so many saints to be born and so the 
saints will be born in case you have good

120
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,410
married time, happy married life and enjoyable 
life.

121
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:42,380
I think all this lecturing is of no use unless 
and until you start enjoying your married

122
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:43,380
life.

123
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,380
There are such sweet things I need not tell 
you.

124
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:48,240
I was surprised that there is no book in English 
language which describes the romance after

125
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,710
marriage, I was surprised, no book, can you 
imagine? and in India you won’t find any

126
00:11:55,710 --> 00:11:59,209
books which describe the romance before the 
marriage.

127
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:10,410
Nowadays they have started doing some sort 
of stupid things but normally no question.

128
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:17,850
So now it is for you, enjoy your married life 
much more than you have enjoyed your childhood,

129
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,810
your youth or any other times in college, 
schools, anywhere.

130
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,790
So be prepared.

131
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:30,060
Make yourself friendly, ??open it, open your 
heart.

132
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,709
Don’t try to find faults in your wife.

133
00:12:32,709 --> 00:12:35,810
I mean some things she doesn’t know, some 
things you don’t know.

134
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:36,810
Doesn’t matter.

135
00:12:36,810 --> 00:12:39,579
All the time trying to find faults makes you 
faulty.

136
00:12:39,579 --> 00:12:41,079
Don’t find faults.

137
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:49,699
If you see somebody doing something wrong, 
suppose if you find that person is trying

138
00:12:49,699 --> 00:12:51,949
to do something.

139
00:12:51,949 --> 00:12:58,610
All right, you just do it your self or don’t 
tell.

140
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:04,829
Gradually she will learn from you what is 
the right way is.

141
00:13:04,829 --> 00:13:08,590
And one should make fun of these moments, 
for example I don’t know how to do any banking,

142
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:09,590
write a cheque.

143
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:16,589
I am very bad at many things you see, can’t 
even open a television, I can’t even the

144
00:13:16,589 --> 00:13:17,970
air conditioner.

145
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:20,810
So many things I just can’t do.

146
00:13:20,810 --> 00:13:21,810
Doesn’t matter.

147
00:13:21,810 --> 00:13:22,839
My husband also equally the same.

148
00:13:22,839 --> 00:13:24,110
So we enjoy each other.

149
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:26,650
All part and parcel of Sahaja Yoga.

150
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:30,240
One unit here, one unit there, one unit there.

151
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,709
But they are in the same ocean of spirituality.

152
00:13:36,709 --> 00:13:44,380
So any Sahaja Yogi who comes to your house 
or any one, especially Indian women you will

153
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:45,420
find, they will look after the guests very 
well.

154
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:51,360
And then there is some sort of a thing called 
jealousy comes out… it’s very absurd.

155
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:56,830
Indian women will not have anybody else as 
their husbands but their own.

156
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:57,830
It is then worked out.

157
00:13:57,830 --> 00:13:59,760
So don’t have these funny ideas that she 
is very friendly, she is looking after other

158
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,760
people, this and that.

159
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:05,620
This kind of a nonsense should not be there.

160
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:14,139
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have those things, 
we have become very pure, their eyes are pure.

161
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,960
So don’t have any doubts about your wives.

162
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:23,250
Same with the wives I will tell you.

163
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:28,279
This will make your life very much more happier 
and confident.

164
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:36,389
If you have any problem you can always write 
to me directly, need not even.

165
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:45,460
tell through your leaders you can directly 
write to me if you really have problem.

166
00:14:45,460 --> 00:15:00,930
But I think you are all intelligent people, 
you should be able to sort out everything.
