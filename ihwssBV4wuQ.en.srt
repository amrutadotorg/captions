1
00:00:02,920 --> 00:00:06,947
But first of all, people do not understand that
you have to work it

2
00:00:07,027 --> 00:00:09,710
through your heart and not\hthrough your brain.

3
00:00:09,826 --> 00:00:14,057
When we have to work out
things through our brain, we try to develop\h\hour brain,

4
00:00:14,236 --> 00:00:15,764
isn’t it?

5
00:00:15,844 --> 00:00:19,265
By memorizing, by practising\hsomething,

6
00:00:19,345 --> 00:00:23,280
teaching our brain how to think, how to go this way that way.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:25,685
We try to train our brain.

8
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:29,084
Now, we have to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga.

9
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,052
And to train our heart in Sahaja Yoga,

10
00:00:33,602 --> 00:00:35,761
one has to\hknow, first of all,

11
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:41,500
that it is enveloped either by ego or by superego.

12
00:00:41,919 --> 00:00:45,309
The limbic
area actually represents the heart.

13
00:00:46,789 --> 00:00:53,319
And if there is ego, heart will always be
so-called,

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:57,513
it will not be the real heart that\hwill be working, but it’s only mental,

15
00:00:57,593 --> 00:00:58,987
mental\hprojection.

16
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:02,040
And you will feel that, “I’m doing\h\hit from my heart.”

17
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,682
But it’s not true.

18
00:01:04,451 --> 00:01:08,281
Now then,\hsupposing,
 what should we do if we have ego?

19
00:01:09,381 --> 00:01:14,318
You might say, you should try to sort of tell yourself
that, "That’s not good and this and that

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:18,532
and all\hkinds of mental suggestions"

21
00:01:18,677 --> 00:01:20,668
or autosuggestions\hor this –

22
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:24,368
the way psychiatrists know that give you suggestions.

23
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:27,595
That’s again mental.

24
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:30,656
So,\hthat’s not the way it is going to work out.

25
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,016
We must understand that for that what we have to
do is to

26
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:37,507
raise the left side and put it to the right side.

27
00:01:37,588 --> 00:01:39,294
There’s no other way out.

28
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:43,256
You have to just work it out with your hands, your hands are working it out

29
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:47,747
and not your brain.\hSo use your hands

30
00:01:47,921 --> 00:01:49,963
and the methods of Sahaja Yoga.

31
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:57,484
Now, everyone must have a regular sitting
in the water

32
00:01:57,564 --> 00:01:59,732
every day, that’s important.

33
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,830
Every morning you must do your meditation.

34
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:09,807
You have to know that Sahaja Yoga is to
be worked out, it‘s not to be thought out.

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:16,842
You just cannot think about it. Whatever
you may try to do through your thought,

36
00:02:17,082 --> 00:02:21,842
you cannot achieve any results in Sahaja Yoga. You\hhave to use your hands, you have to use your feet,

37
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:26,500
\h\hyou have to soak your feet in the water because
water is the ocean.

38
00:02:26,585 --> 00:02:31,856
All these five chakras – or,\h\hsay, six chakras

39
00:02:32,387 --> 00:02:35,979
which are — I say five
because the…

40
00:02:36,106 --> 00:02:40,748
one is the Mooladhara Chakra, which is the seven

41
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:44,636
and the topmost is the brain.

42
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:48,887
So, in between five chakras which
are there —

43
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,587
are to be handled fully

44
00:02:51,667 --> 00:02:57,735
with the\hidea that they are basically made of matter.

45
00:03:00,032 --> 00:03:03,632
And these five elements constitute

46
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:08,370
the body of these chakras.

47
00:03:09,314 --> 00:03:13,523
Now, these chakras, if\hthey are to be corrected,

48
00:03:13,603 --> 00:03:19,232
we have to correct them by taking out all the problems of these chakras

49
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:23,860
into the elements from which they’re coming.

50
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:29,364
For example, a person who is
a very right-sided person,

51
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:34,436
so, he has to give a balance by the left-side.

52
00:03:35,698 --> 00:03:40,397
Of course, raising with the hand is
all right. But what about the element?

53
00:03:40,732 --> 00:03:45,680
Right-sided person has all the elements\hwhich give heat:

54
00:03:45,905 --> 00:03:47,842
we can say, the light,

55
00:03:48,068 --> 00:03:50,596
we can say, the fire.

56
00:03:50,676 --> 00:03:53,989
So, for people who are\hright-sided,

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,429
the light is not going to help much.

58
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:04,077
Like, if you put the light before the photograph,
and those who are ego-oriented people

59
00:04:04,317 --> 00:04:07,582
— if you just use the light, it’s not going to work out.

60
00:04:07,892 --> 00:04:11,581
So, what is going to work out is the Mother Earth

61
00:04:11,715 --> 00:04:17,568
and the water element, which is cooling.

62
00:04:17,963 --> 00:04:23,975
Even ice\his very helpful to people who are right-sided.

63
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:36,798
So, all cooling effects should be used
for correcting your right-sidedness,

64
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:39,345
so that you cool it down.

65
00:04:39,486 --> 00:04:41,228
Same about food.

66
00:04:41,726 --> 00:04:47,577
In food, those who are right-sided people should
take to foods

67
00:04:47,657 --> 00:04:52,834
which are left-sided, that is carbohydrates, means they should become partly\hvegetarians,

68
00:04:52,914 --> 00:04:55,665
or quite a lot of vegetarians.

69
00:04:56,736 --> 00:05:01,251
And should eat things at the most like chicken,

70
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:06,842
but\hnot fishes, not seafoods because they are all hot.

71
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:12,766
That’s how you treat your material side of your
chakras.

72
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:17,195
Now, the left-sided people should use, again,

73
00:05:17,294 --> 00:05:20,450
the "deepam" is the light or the fire

74
00:05:20,614 --> 00:05:24,788
to\hcorrect their left-side.

75
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:31,651
Also, in food such people should take more to nitrogenous, means protein

76
00:05:31,949 --> 00:05:36,953
and\hfoods like that. They should take more proteins.

77
00:05:37,727 --> 00:05:43,230
Now, as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

78
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:46,388
the basic\hthing is Kundalini.

79
00:05:46,543 --> 00:05:52,621
And the Kundalini, as I have told you, is the pure desire.

80
00:05:52,825 --> 00:05:57,425
Again, listen\hto it carefully: pure desire.

81
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:01,050
That means all other desires are impure.

82
00:06:01,206 --> 00:06:03,100
There’s only one pure\hdesire.

83
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,362
And that is to be one with the Divine,

84
00:06:06,527 --> 00:06:11,981
one with the Brahma, one with God — that’s the
only pure desire.

85
00:06:12,531 --> 00:06:15,888
All other desires are impure.
