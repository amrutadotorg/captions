00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:09.560
So one should marry with a very open heart
because you are marrying in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:18.010
Is no other binding force for you but your
love and affection and care for each other.

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.500
Now as you have got a bride and you have got
a husband I will tell you one thing that Sahaja

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:36.530
Yoga will grow much more now because of you
being there as couples who follow Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.210
and who will have children of very great spiritual
character.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.890
There are many saints who want to be born
on this Earth.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:52.089
All these saints will be born to you because
you are Sahaja Yogis and you are at a level

00:00:52.089 --> 00:01:00.940
of that great consciousness which we call
as Atma Sakshatkar (Self-realisation).

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:09.540
I wish you all very great love, prosperity
and joy and that you all develop in Sahaja

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:16.240
Yoga in a very great love and understanding;
forgetting what is what was your past what

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.580
was your religion, what was your caste, what
was your country.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.580
Forget everything!

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:31.579
We are all really human beings and now we
are realised souls so there is no difference

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.790
like this.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:38.649
And all of you should prosper in such a manner
that other people should see you and try to

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:39.810
follow you.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.310
It’s a big, very big responsibility.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.310
I hope you understand and realise.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:56.189
Thank you, may God bless you.

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:04.289
Now, first thing you have to do is to accept
the the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:12.530
This is the religion which is a universal
religion which encompasses all the religions,

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.340
respects all the great incarnations, knows
about them and all the good things that are

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.099
told in all the religions it accepts.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:28.460
It’s one religion which is not outside.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.180
Outside religions have created problems.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.510
You know they just create differences and
divides people, it’s divisiveness, divides

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:39.590
people.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.260
But this is one religion.

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.269
But this one religion was there amongst sufis
among all the saints.

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:54.989
All those people who were born realised souls,
they had the same religion and that religion

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.860
of humanity we follow.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.420
This religion is not outside it is inside.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.550
It’s inside, within yourself; is awakened.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.749
And here we respect all the great incarnations.

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:13.349
All the great religions we respect, not only
that [but] we follow [them].

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:17.590
But we do not believe in any differentiation
or superiority.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.940
So, first, we have to accept that you belong
to this religion then there won’t be any

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:32.360
fights about small things, like, “I belong
to this caste, this community, this religion,

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.190
this country,” nothing.

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:41.319
You are beyond that, and thats what we have
to establish if you want to have real peace

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:44.379
and joy and blessings of the Divine.

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.249
So this is the first thing that we have to
do [in the marriage vows], is to accept.
