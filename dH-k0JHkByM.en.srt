1
00:00:08,024 --> 00:00:15,854
Today, we have to know something about the connection

2
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:20,713
of Sahaja Yoga with this Mother Earth.

3
00:00:20,914 --> 00:00:22,713
It is very important,

4
00:00:22,914 --> 00:00:28,023
that we must understand the value of the Mother Earth.

5
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,877
She has been very kind to all of you,

6
00:00:31,078 --> 00:00:33,674
She has been sucking your vibrations.

7
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,554
She has been, otherwise also,

8
00:00:36,755 --> 00:00:41,874
She has given you everything that you see around.

9
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:49,397
So today, we have to understand the connection,

10
00:00:49,598 --> 00:00:54,920
and the symbolic expression of the Mother Earth within ourselves.

11
00:00:55,121 --> 00:00:58,764
I have told you before also that

12
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:02,366
Kundalini, which is in three and a half coils

13
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:09,348
is placed within a triangular bone.

14
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:16,342
Now this abode of the Kundalini is called as Mooladhara,

15
00:01:16,543 --> 00:01:23,764
and is represented in the universe as this Mother Earth.

16
00:01:25,801 --> 00:01:28,819
Or in the puja, it is represented as the Kumbha.

17
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,020
I don’t know if you have made the Kumbha or not? Have you?

18
00:01:32,221 --> 00:01:36,746
Yes. The Kumbha is it here.

19
00:01:44,467 --> 00:01:50,875
So far, in the movement of our consciousness,

20
00:01:51,076 --> 00:02:00,499
we have been trying to understand the God Almighty

21
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:07,562
and all other five elements that we call as important.

22
00:02:17,652 --> 00:02:21,911
And also,

23
00:02:22,112 --> 00:02:25,864
the consciousness has been moving

24
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:32,481
towards the understanding of

25
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:38,291
all the other four elements but the Mother Earth.

26
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:43,536
That had to be such, because unless and until

27
00:02:43,737 --> 00:02:49,270
the understanding of all these four other elements

28
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:52,801
are brought to a certain degree,

29
00:02:53,002 --> 00:02:55,707
the Mother Earth cannot express itself.

30
00:02:55,908 --> 00:03:00,262
Like if all your chakras, four chakras, are caught up,

31
00:03:00,463 --> 00:03:03,246
you cannot raise the Kundalini,

32
00:03:03,447 --> 00:03:06,238
you cannot give Self-Realization.

33
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:10,652
You cannot have a mass evolutionary process done.

34
00:03:10,853 --> 00:03:15,261
That’s why we had yagyas,

35
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:20,870
all other methods of exciting the four elements.

36
00:03:21,071 --> 00:03:23,893
They worshipped the water

37
00:03:24,094 --> 00:03:30,922
and they worshipped air, the sky, the firmament, the light.

38
00:03:33,627 --> 00:03:36,945
And that’s how they came up to the time of Christ

39
00:03:37,146 --> 00:03:42,356
where light was worshipped.

40
00:03:44,373 --> 00:03:50,008
But today when we are in this modern Sahaja Yoga,

41
00:03:50,209 --> 00:03:53,321
we are actually at the level of the Mother Earth,

42
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:56,110
because this is the age of the Aquarius.

43
00:03:56,311 --> 00:04:00,977
And Aquarius is the same as the Kumbha—

44
00:04:01,178 --> 00:04:03,852
is the Mother Earth.

45
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:09,021
So we are at the level of the Mother Earth.

46
00:04:10,186 --> 00:04:15,313
You can also see in the consciousness of human beings;

47
00:04:15,514 --> 00:04:19,532
I’m saying not only men, but women also and men.

48
00:04:19,733 --> 00:04:22,962
The consciousness is moving more towards

49
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:28,564
the feminine expression of life.

50
00:04:28,765 --> 00:04:31,212
But as stupid as human beings are,

51
00:04:31,413 --> 00:04:35,470
the feminists also have been very stupid,

52
00:04:35,671 --> 00:04:40,403
that they are fighting on the level of rationality,

53
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:45,239
of economics, of politics—all useless things.

54
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,356
Equality on all these things if they are to be sought,

55
00:04:48,557 --> 00:04:52,614
you become men, you just become like men.

56
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:55,421
 If you are argumentative, if you are rational,

57
00:04:55,622 --> 00:04:59,741
if you talk like man, it’s a masculine development.

58
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:03,062
But the Mothers development, the feminine development,

59
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:08,351
is not equality in the way the men have been stupid.

60
00:05:08,552 --> 00:05:11,273
No use competing with men in their stupidity,

61
00:05:11,474 --> 00:05:14,240
the amount of stupidity has been created already for us

62
00:05:14,441 --> 00:05:16,842
quite sufficiently.

63
00:05:17,043 --> 00:05:20,733
The whole world is today, is expressing that nonsense

64
00:05:20,934 --> 00:05:25,866
that they have—the competition, the aggression, the oppression.

65
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:29,264
So the other side of the woman, which was called as the

66
00:05:29,465 --> 00:05:34,794
dominated one, the dark side, the oppressed and all that

67
00:05:34,995 --> 00:05:37,424
 has to express itself in a different way.

68
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:41,768
The whole mode, the style, has to change.

69
00:05:41,969 --> 00:05:44,635
See now, in Christianity one should understand;

70
00:05:44,836 --> 00:05:47,658
why Christianity, even Judaism, any religion,

71
00:05:47,859 --> 00:05:51,150
even Hinduism and all that

72
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,101
but its more in Christianity, surprisingly

73
00:05:54,302 --> 00:06:00,476
they just had no place for Mary.

74
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:06,617
And Muslims even crowned it by completely canceling Fatima.

75
00:06:06,818 --> 00:06:12,515
And on top of that,

76
00:06:12,716 --> 00:06:16,999
you will see that among Christians, I think that ordination,

77
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:20,782
or what you call that, is not given to the lady to women,

78
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:26,061
while Christ was not born of a man.

79
00:06:27,811 --> 00:06:31,227
But that does not in any way mean that you compete men

80
00:06:31,428 --> 00:06:36,792
in their foolish enterprises by which they have practically

81
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:40,597
brought this world to such a ruinous state.

82
00:06:40,798 --> 00:06:46,824
So today we have to understand that it is the time for

83
00:06:47,025 --> 00:06:50,680
the motherly qualities to develop. Even a man,

84
00:06:50,881 --> 00:06:54,274
when he becomes motherly only, becomes a great man.

85
00:06:54,475 --> 00:07:01,360
Like Christ, when he had compassion, he was called as a saint.

86
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:06,008
So the quality of a woman as a Mother—

87
00:07:06,209 --> 00:07:09,594
Goddess is always as a Mother—

88
00:07:09,795 --> 00:07:13,908
and She is the power most important to ignite Sahaja Yoga.

89
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:17,002
Now how She ignites, I’ll tell you.

90
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,611
I’ll give an analogy, but analogy should not be carried too far—

91
00:07:20,812 --> 00:07:25,213
as wise Sahaja Yogis you should not carry it too far.

92
00:07:25,414 --> 00:07:28,557
Say there is a zero, it has no meaning.

93
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:32,284
In the same way God Almighty has no meaning,

94
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:37,284
till you put some sort of one or two before it.

95
00:07:37,485 --> 00:07:40,331
It’s a zero. It has an existence

96
00:07:40,532 --> 00:07:44,831
but it has no capacity or a power to express itself.

97
00:07:45,032 --> 00:07:46,425
So it’s a zero.

98
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:51,113
Like that we should say the masculine growth is a zero.

99
00:07:51,314 --> 00:07:53,863
Another analogy I will give you to understand it.

100
00:07:54,064 --> 00:07:59,301
That if you see

101
00:07:59,502 --> 00:08:05,504
very high power wires, going over your heads,

102
00:08:05,705 --> 00:08:09,304
they are absolutely harmless, there’s no trouble.

103
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:13,365
In Delhi there was a suggestion that there is a very big plot of

104
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:18,655
available where there are high power wires are going

105
00:08:18,856 --> 00:08:22,999
and we can have it for free. I asked "What is the problem?"

106
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:26,717
They said only, if earth gets connected with that

107
00:08:26,918 --> 00:08:30,342
then you will have problem.

108
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:33,932
So till these-this high power thing, whatever it is—

109
00:08:34,133 --> 00:08:38,612
is not connected with the earth, it has no meaning at all.

110
00:08:38,813 --> 00:08:44,105
But earth is very different from this dynamic power

111
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:49,855
that is flowing through those wires, which are zero,

112
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:53,337
which mean nothing.

113
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:57,401
In the same way, in a woman,

114
00:08:57,602 --> 00:09:03,117
the womb of a woman is the Kundalini.

115
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:07,175
Now what is a womb? Now, if that is the Kundalini,

116
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:09,800
that expresses the Kundalini in the gross;

117
00:09:10,001 --> 00:09:14,214
that means the Mother Earth is also like the womb.

118
00:09:14,415 --> 00:09:17,722
Now what does a womb do?

119
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:22,542
It receives the sperm,

120
00:09:22,743 --> 00:09:26,760
which is just a frivolous act of man

121
00:09:26,961 --> 00:09:30,244
or you can say just an aggression,

122
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,213
and she then nourishes -

123
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:38,752
looks after it, corrects it

124
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:43,299
and allows it to grow, not in an aggressive way

125
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,752
but in a very compassionate and a sensible way,

126
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:54,171
till it is expelled out of the womb when it is grown up.

127
00:09:55,453 --> 00:09:59,752
So the idea of womb is that the expression has to be

128
00:09:59,953 --> 00:10:05,190
in such a manner that it does not dominate.

129
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:09,362
It does not dominate the embryo.

130
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:12,003
If it dominates, how can it grow?

131
00:10:12,204 --> 00:10:16,011
So it nourishes it and makes it grow.

132
00:10:16,212 --> 00:10:18,706
This is what today’s Sahaja Yoga is.

133
00:10:18,907 --> 00:10:21,987
That now the Mother Earth is the one,

134
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:27,378
who is symbolized within you as the Mooladhara,

135
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:31,292
as symbolized as the AdiShakti here-

136
00:10:31,493 --> 00:10:35,097
is sitting down before you to nourish you,

137
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:38,269
to make you grow into new personalities—

138
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,102
into mature personalities.

139
00:10:43,423 --> 00:10:47,524
This concept we must understand.

140
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:50,886
So the women of the West must understand

141
00:10:51,087 --> 00:10:53,630
that the nonsensical ideas they have taken from men

142
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:59,075
must be completely discarded. They have to become women first.

143
00:10:59,276 --> 00:11:02,864
Those women who just are talking like men,

144
00:11:03,065 --> 00:11:06,841
can never help in Sahaja Yoga.

145
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:12,263
They have to be like this Mother Earth who allows you

146
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:14,716
to do what you like with Her.

147
00:11:14,917 --> 00:11:17,553
I mean you human beings have been so stupid

148
00:11:17,754 --> 00:11:20,483
to exploit Her to the maximum,

149
00:11:20,684 --> 00:11:26,075
not onlyt hat but also She

150
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:29,232
bears lot of nonsense upon Herself.

151
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:33,912
But then a time reaches where She becomes explosive,

152
00:11:34,113 --> 00:11:39,170
then She starts consuming people inside Herself.

153
00:11:39,371 --> 00:11:42,350
And when She is consuming people

154
00:11:42,551 --> 00:11:46,608
then you see the earthquakes and droughts and this and that,

155
00:11:46,809 --> 00:11:51,663
all these things start coming in and people get engulfed

156
00:11:51,864 --> 00:11:56,538
into these problems

157
00:11:56,739 --> 00:12:01,324
which they blame Mother Earth for that.

158
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:10,541
The problems that human beings have created

159
00:12:10,742 --> 00:12:15,549
out of aggressive nature—even aggression towards the Mother Earth,

160
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:20,377
they have to pay dividend for that. And they are paying.

161
00:12:20,578 --> 00:12:24,572
Now, to stop this kind of a movement of aggressiveness

162
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:27,416
which brings all kinds of disturbances,

163
00:12:27,617 --> 00:12:31,549
one has to recede back and should develop

164
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:36,463
the sense of totality, of compassion.

165
00:12:36,664 --> 00:12:41,065
Unless and until, you understand totality,

166
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:43,393
the total, the complete, the whole—

167
00:12:43,594 --> 00:12:48,721
that’s the womb that’s your Mother.

168
00:12:48,922 --> 00:12:51,916
As long as you try to be individualistic

169
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:56,611
you cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi.

170
00:12:56,812 --> 00:13:01,119
You have to become one with the whole.

171
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,865
Now we have to face ourselves for that, very important it is.

172
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:08,545
Specially in the west, I would say we have to face ourselves

173
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,733
very clearly—what are we up to?

174
00:13:11,934 --> 00:13:15,863
That’s a very important thing.

175
00:13:17,926 --> 00:13:22,863
First of all let us see where is our attention.

176
00:13:23,551 --> 00:13:28,811
Ask a question. We are Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yogis

177
00:13:29,012 --> 00:13:33,475
within our fold

178
00:13:33,676 --> 00:13:38,733
and I am sometimes surprised that even now,

179
00:13:38,934 --> 00:13:43,121
the attention can be very funny.

180
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:48,241
Like, simple thing, like we can have attention

181
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:52,098
on material things:

182
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:58,593
"this is mine-this is yours;

183
00:13:58,794 --> 00:14:01,835
that I should have my privacy." Then you are gone into

184
00:14:02,036 --> 00:14:05,741
the another realm of aggressiveness.

185
00:14:05,942 --> 00:14:08,061
If you try to have your own privacy,

186
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:15,769
then you are depriving others of their privacy.

187
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:19,680
It was all right when you were not Sahaja Yogis,

188
00:14:19,881 --> 00:14:22,227
to have your privacy, because you had to grow

189
00:14:22,428 --> 00:14:26,758
in your privacy at that time. But after Sahaja Yoga

190
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:33,899
you have to become one with everyone else—

191
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,235
that is very important. Before Sahaja Yoga

192
00:14:37,436 --> 00:14:43,118
you were different and after Sahaja Yoga you are different.

193
00:14:43,319 --> 00:14:48,259
The whole concept must change after Sahaja Yoga.

194
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,392
That now you have become one with the whole

195
00:14:51,593 --> 00:14:54,697
and to feel that you are one with the whole,

196
00:14:54,898 --> 00:15:00,111
you should try to give up all your individualistic attitudes.

197
00:15:00,312 --> 00:15:07,330
That’s very common now to hear "Yes, I like this, I like that."

198
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:12,463
It’s very common: "I like it." Very common.

199
00:15:12,664 --> 00:15:17,960
But doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to say such a thing.

200
00:15:19,031 --> 00:15:24,072
You see, how can I say that I like some thing?

201
00:15:24,273 --> 00:15:29,588
Think of a mother who has to bear the child,

202
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:34,822
has to give birth to a child, has to look after the child,

203
00:15:35,023 --> 00:15:39,197
the needs of the child, protect the child,

204
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:41,603
train the child. How can she say:

205
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:46,108
"I like this" and "I like that"! Where is the time?

206
00:15:46,578 --> 00:15:49,697
To think what you like and what you don’t like,

207
00:15:49,898 --> 00:15:55,244
"I like this food, I like that food". Where is the time?

208
00:15:55,445 --> 00:15:58,744
Where is the energy left for that? Where is the attention?

209
00:15:58,945 --> 00:16:05,463
The attention is on the upbringing of the child.

210
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:11,244
Now in the same way a Sahaja Yogi must know that

211
00:16:11,445 --> 00:16:16,517
the child within him is born—

212
00:16:16,718 --> 00:16:19,080
the Spirit.

213
00:16:19,281 --> 00:16:22,908
Spirit is the child

214
00:16:23,109 --> 00:16:25,728
which has been born within him,

215
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:30,884
now he has to nourish, through the Kundalini.

216
00:16:31,085 --> 00:16:35,181
He has to water it, he has to look after it.

217
00:16:35,382 --> 00:16:38,884
It has to make it grow. Now where is the time

218
00:16:39,085 --> 00:16:42,173
for other nonsensical things? You have a child in hand.

219
00:16:42,374 --> 00:16:47,517
You are all mothers looking after your child—that’s your Spirit.

220
00:16:47,718 --> 00:16:51,509
So where do you have time for all these things?

221
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,478
What attention should be:

222
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,861
"What can I do to make this child happy,

223
00:16:57,062 --> 00:17:01,080
to make this child grow, to make this child

224
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:03,932
completely manifest my self."

225
00:17:04,133 --> 00:17:07,471
The mother replaces herself

226
00:17:07,672 --> 00:17:11,416
as soon as the child becomes a mature child.

227
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:13,971
So now in you, the Motherhood

228
00:17:14,172 --> 00:17:18,159
must take over than the Fatherhood.

229
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:21,518
Motherhood towards yourself. The attitude should be

230
00:17:21,719 --> 00:17:24,354
 like a Mother towards the child.

231
00:17:24,555 --> 00:17:27,018
How her attention is towards the child?

232
00:17:27,219 --> 00:17:32,057
You can see in every day-to-day life how we behave.

233
00:17:32,258 --> 00:17:36,784
I have seen people very much interested even now, in food.

234
00:17:36,985 --> 00:17:39,495
I mean, where is the time? Where is the attention?

235
00:17:39,696 --> 00:17:42,433
How can you be so much worried about your food?

236
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:45,503
Worried about your sleep. Worried about your health;

237
00:17:45,704 --> 00:17:49,737
worried about this-that? I mean, here you are to worry about your child

238
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:52,268
which you have got now within.

239
00:17:52,469 --> 00:17:56,015
And that’s why the child is neglected and sometimes you find

240
00:17:56,040 --> 00:18:01,055
the child becomes sick or sometimes goes into a coma

241
00:18:01,256 --> 00:18:04,844
or may die away also.

242
00:18:05,045 --> 00:18:09,055
So the situation is very different now for Sahaja Yogis:

243
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:13,313
"how to treat themselves?"

244
00:18:13,514 --> 00:18:16,454
Those who are running after still food

245
00:18:16,655 --> 00:18:19,665
and all these nonsensical things. I mean have seen Sahaja Yogis,

246
00:18:19,866 --> 00:18:24,412
all their attention is on food all the time.

247
00:18:25,155 --> 00:18:27,673
How dedication can come in a person

248
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:33,233
who is so much dedicated to food habits?

249
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:38,165
Like, we have seen,

250
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:41,774
you might have also seen—some of you—Ajanta caves were built.

251
00:18:41,975 --> 00:18:45,563
In ten generations they built Ajanta caves,

252
00:18:45,764 --> 00:18:49,969
ten generations! And

253
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:54,578
they built it in a place where there was not even water available—

254
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:57,586
to begin with.

255
00:18:57,787 --> 00:19:00,680
And day in and day out thousands of people,

256
00:19:00,881 --> 00:19:05,219
without getting any payment, without getting anything, built it.

257
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,321
No food—no question!

258
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:10,477
They used to eat some fruits somewhere here, there,

259
00:19:10,678 --> 00:19:15,420
but their dedication gave them power to do it.

260
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:19,532
But this dedication can only be developed

261
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:25,404
if you realize that you have to Mother your child.

262
00:19:27,943 --> 00:19:32,802
Now if the mother is ugly, the child will be ugly too.

263
00:19:33,003 --> 00:19:36,919
Because it is the mother who is expressed in the child.

264
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,239
She doesn’t dominate the child all right,

265
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:45,244
but she definitely can corrupt the image of the child.

266
00:19:46,448 --> 00:19:52,083
And that’s what exactly happens when we, the Sahaja Yogis,

267
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:55,286
are not bothered as to look after our Spirit

268
00:19:55,487 --> 00:20:00,111
and our spiritual growth. Even now, you will be surprised,

269
00:20:00,312 --> 00:20:03,900
fifty percent people write letters to Me:

270
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:06,978
"Mother I am still possessed,

271
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:10,376
I have worked with lemons and chilies,

272
00:20:10,577 --> 00:20:13,790
I am coming to you for this and that."

273
00:20:13,991 --> 00:20:17,811
It is a very low-grade business. I think even after so many years

274
00:20:17,836 --> 00:20:21,124
if you are possessed, then I think you should beat yourself

275
00:20:21,149 --> 00:20:23,153
every day hundred and eight times.

276
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:29,481
It’s a very low grade behavior, I personally think,

277
00:20:29,682 --> 00:20:33,396
that after your Mother has worked so hard with you;

278
00:20:33,421 --> 00:20:37,283
you are still just the same, coming back with the

279
00:20:37,308 --> 00:20:43,127
horrible idea of bringing

280
00:20:43,152 --> 00:20:47,440
all kinds of problems to your Mother.

281
00:20:49,019 --> 00:20:53,756
That means you have not looking after your child.

282
00:20:53,957 --> 00:20:57,029
Now in Sahaja Yoga it’s not a child

283
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:00,404
which is an individual child you have to look after.

284
00:21:00,605 --> 00:21:05,342
This is, one should understand. This is where we miss very much,

285
00:21:05,543 --> 00:21:08,545
especially by the intellectuals.

286
00:21:08,746 --> 00:21:12,717
They think it is their own child which should be all right,

287
00:21:12,918 --> 00:21:16,941
doesn’t matter about others’ children. Or, doesn’t matter

288
00:21:16,966 --> 00:21:21,118
if you have connection with others or not. It’s very common.

289
00:21:21,319 --> 00:21:23,109
Because, in the rationality gives them that sense,

290
00:21:23,310 --> 00:21:26,164
"Oh my spirits are all right, my vibrations are all right,

291
00:21:26,365 --> 00:21:28,997
so it is all right if I do not go to puja

292
00:21:29,198 --> 00:21:31,560
or if I do not go to any collective thing

293
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,640
or if I do not support in any collective work

294
00:21:34,665 --> 00:21:38,661
or if I do not take any responsibility of Sahaja Yoga.

295
00:21:38,862 --> 00:21:43,302
Because once you become collective you take responsibilities.

296
00:21:43,503 --> 00:21:47,888
So you are over satisfied with yourself that is good,

297
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:52,068
that I need not take up any responsibility.

298
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:55,443
All the Sahaja Yogis are bad, or some of them are bad.

299
00:21:55,644 --> 00:22:00,920
I have nothing to do with them and this is that and that and that.

300
00:22:01,121 --> 00:22:07,300
But in Sahaja Yoga as it is, the Motherhood is universal.

301
00:22:08,371 --> 00:22:16,372
Because if you are the nose, say then somebody is the eye;

302
00:22:16,573 --> 00:22:22,705
 if you are the ears, somebody is the lips.

303
00:22:23,386 --> 00:22:28,287
So, it is essential for you to understand

304
00:22:28,488 --> 00:22:35,029
that anybody who is a Sahaja Yogi is in trouble,

305
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:39,373
you are in trouble. Is threat to your growth;

306
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:43,090
it is a threat to your growth, because it is the Whole that is growing.

307
00:22:43,115 --> 00:22:45,766
Of course, those who are absolutely useless

308
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:50,696
will be thrown away, gradually. That’s what Mother does.

309
00:22:50,897 --> 00:22:56,673
They can be thrown away absolutely,

310
00:22:56,874 --> 00:22:59,743
so much far away that they will never return.

311
00:22:59,944 --> 00:23:02,571
But you don’t have to worry about such people,

312
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:06,657
they will be thrown away. They will be given some chances,

313
00:23:06,858 --> 00:23:12,516
some more credits will be given, some graces will be given,

314
00:23:12,717 --> 00:23:15,446
but ultimately they will be thrown away. So you don’t have to worry.

315
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:18,055
But you must worry about the Whole.

316
00:23:18,256 --> 00:23:22,227
And you have to take up the responsibility.

317
00:23:22,428 --> 00:23:26,625
Those who do not take up the responsibility

318
00:23:26,826 --> 00:23:32,211
are not the people who are yet matured their child—

319
00:23:32,412 --> 00:23:35,031
that’s the Spirit.

320
00:23:35,232 --> 00:23:38,367
Every type of responsibility that you can take,

321
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:41,851
think of what responsibilities you can take.

322
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:44,812
That is why most of us have bad Vishuddhis,

323
00:23:45,013 --> 00:23:47,718
because we do not take the responsibilities,

324
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,765
and whatever responsibility we do take

325
00:23:50,966 --> 00:23:55,249
we have to be much, much, much more responsible

326
00:23:55,450 --> 00:24:00,879
than ordinary government servants are.

327
00:24:03,164 --> 00:24:07,432
Sometimes we hear from one ear and throw it away from the same—

328
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:11,750
don’t even allow it to come into the head.

329
00:24:15,047 --> 00:24:21,760
So, one has to understand that the child is your responsibility,

330
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:24,073
you have to look after the child.

331
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:29,656
And the Whole is also your responsibility.

332
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:36,808
Now, how to establish the connection between your Spirit,

333
00:24:37,009 --> 00:24:41,691
or keep the connection on between the Spirit and the womb,

334
00:24:41,892 --> 00:24:45,515
or the Kundalini,

335
00:24:45,716 --> 00:24:48,382
is the biggest problem that we all face:

336
00:24:48,583 --> 00:24:51,374
that our connections are very loose

337
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:58,700
and that’s why this Kundalini cannot look after the Spirit.

338
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:02,858
I wonder if you have noticed one thing in Sahaja Yoga,

339
00:25:03,059 --> 00:25:08,699
that you can maneuver the Kundalini, but not the Spirit.

340
00:25:10,794 --> 00:25:13,674
You can raise your hand; the Kundalini will move.

341
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,830
You can maneuver it.

342
00:25:16,031 --> 00:25:19,596
You can give it a bandhan, it will go around and round and round.

343
00:25:19,797 --> 00:25:23,299
But what about the Spirit?

344
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,822
You cannot maneuver it.

345
00:25:26,023 --> 00:25:28,824
There is only one mantra to awaken the Spirit,

346
00:25:29,025 --> 00:25:33,238
in the sense that to please him you have to say you are the Spirit.

347
00:25:33,439 --> 00:25:36,581
But you cannot maneuver it. You have to bring in Kundalini

348
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:40,472
to look after it, you have to take Kundalini there,

349
00:25:40,673 --> 00:25:46,027
to the heart, so that this child

350
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:50,027
which is the little offspring just now

351
00:25:50,228 --> 00:25:56,837
has to be carefully developed and matured.

352
00:25:59,277 --> 00:26:03,679
So on both the sides, of men or women,

353
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,710
we have to understand, that if you are a man,

354
00:26:09,911 --> 00:26:14,898
and if you are dominating man, it’s all right.

355
00:26:15,099 --> 00:26:17,453
But if you are a woman and if you are dominating,

356
00:26:17,654 --> 00:26:20,641
then it’s a difficult thing for Sahaja Yoga to cure you,

357
00:26:20,842 --> 00:26:23,329
because you have lost your quality of being a woman.

358
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:26,360
At least you have to be a woman to begin with.

359
00:26:26,561 --> 00:26:29,203
If you are not even a woman, then what can you do with

360
00:26:29,404 --> 00:26:34,341
this third persons who are neither man nor woman?

361
00:26:34,943 --> 00:26:38,114
Now the men, when they are dominating, they have to understand,

362
00:26:38,315 --> 00:26:41,786
that they have to be compassionate.

363
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:46,075
They have to be kind,

364
00:26:46,276 --> 00:26:52,286
they have to be considerate, but never subservient,

365
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:56,342
never subservient. This is one should understand,

366
00:26:56,543 --> 00:26:59,725
that you should not be subservient.

367
00:26:59,926 --> 00:27:02,858
Now the women, what they have to be;

368
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:07,671
is to be great, large, receptive;

369
00:27:07,872 --> 00:27:10,710
receiving

370
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:14,082
and nourishing all that.

371
00:27:15,567 --> 00:27:19,037
Now the way husbands are told sometimes in this West—

372
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:22,370
I am shocked.

373
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,740
Wife says this to Mr. X, "X you haven’t done this,

374
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,115
X you haven’t done that. How have you put this?

375
00:27:29,316 --> 00:27:33,224
Do this, do that, do that." It’s not woman’s way of doing it,

376
00:27:33,425 --> 00:27:37,751
it’s absolutely wrong that to do it.

377
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:41,340
To tell him to do something.

378
00:27:41,541 --> 00:27:45,129
You are becoming a manly, and then we lose completely

379
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:53,672
that power of giving that nourishment of a woman’s love,

380
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:56,539
which is the power of a woman,

381
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,469
which women don’t understand. I’ll tell you a simple example;

382
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:04,484
My own grand daughter. She wants to be an air hostess all the time, she wants.

383
00:28:04,685 --> 00:28:07,062
She says, "You must have also thought of being an air hostess."

384
00:28:07,263 --> 00:28:09,515
I said, "Why? What is so great about air hostess?"

385
00:28:09,716 --> 00:28:15,184
She says, “That’s the only time you can give food to someone.”

386
00:28:16,732 --> 00:28:22,414
You see a natural instinct of a Mother that let me see them eat, you see.

387
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:27,521
They don’t eat themselves, they want others to eat.

388
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:32,407
But this is not in the conception of the western women, I tell you.

389
00:28:32,608 --> 00:28:34,345
They can’t understand this.

390
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:37,540
"Why? I have done this, so why not he does this, this."

391
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:41,267
It’s your privilege to do these things properly,

392
00:28:41,468 --> 00:28:42,861
in a proper way.

393
00:28:43,062 --> 00:28:46,009
But supposing somebody is a very good mechanic,

394
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:49,267
the woman will also become a mechanic, "I’ll do the mechanical things".

395
00:28:49,468 --> 00:28:51,462
She is not there for doing mechanical work.

396
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:57,600
She is there for the mechanics of the emotions.

397
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:01,055
On the contrary she just does the other way round.

398
00:29:01,256 --> 00:29:03,118
Like a man comes home; she goes on ordering,

399
00:29:03,319 --> 00:29:06,227
"You have to put that right, why did you spoil my carpet?

400
00:29:06,428 --> 00:29:10,641
Why did you do this? Clean it up, get that thing, do that."

401
00:29:10,842 --> 00:29:15,992
All his mechanics of emotions are finished.

402
00:29:16,193 --> 00:29:18,848
Once his mechanics of emotions are finished,

403
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:22,523
he is useless and you are useless as it is.

404
00:29:22,724 --> 00:29:27,692
And men also should not do their jobs. Let them do their own jobs.

405
00:29:28,279 --> 00:29:33,008
I think this is one of the biggest problems of the West today.

406
00:29:33,209 --> 00:29:39,336
That men are neither men, and women are not women.

407
00:29:39,537 --> 00:29:42,477
I find the quality so horrid,

408
00:29:42,678 --> 00:29:46,102
that I don’t know how to deal with the mixtures.

409
00:29:46,303 --> 00:29:50,797
You must understand this very simple thing in life

410
00:29:50,998 --> 00:29:54,102
that if you are a hybrid stuff,

411
00:29:54,303 --> 00:29:57,797
you can’t have the quality of a Sahaja Yogi.

412
00:29:57,998 --> 00:30:00,961
If you mix it up, it’s a very funny thing, isn’t it?

413
00:30:01,162 --> 00:30:04,809
So a woman must try to be a woman

414
00:30:05,010 --> 00:30:07,332
and a man must try to be a man.

415
00:30:07,533 --> 00:30:14,276
Now see, what is the situation, of a man,

416
00:30:14,477 --> 00:30:23,252
as a masculine effect on the development of consciousness?

417
00:30:23,453 --> 00:30:27,385
So, as the manliness was expressed

418
00:30:27,586 --> 00:30:31,328
we have developed science.

419
00:30:32,141 --> 00:30:35,588
We have developed all this knowledge,

420
00:30:35,789 --> 00:30:39,440
all these things which are outside.

421
00:30:39,641 --> 00:30:42,620
Now everything is ready.

422
00:30:42,821 --> 00:30:45,413
Now the woman has to come up.

423
00:30:45,614 --> 00:30:48,397
I mean, I am saying in the very abstract way; don’t think of woman,

424
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:50,670
but you can say the feminine.

425
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:54,748
The feminine nature has to rise now.

426
00:30:54,972 --> 00:30:59,091
Now everything is ready, it has to just spark.

427
00:30:59,669 --> 00:31:03,928
All the chakras are ready, now awaken the Kundalini.

428
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:09,576
Kundalini is as important as the other chakras are.

429
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,857
So now awaken the Kundalini. Now Kundalini’s behavior

430
00:31:13,058 --> 00:31:15,568
and mode of action is very different

431
00:31:15,769 --> 00:31:20,573
from the mode of action of the chakras.

432
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,475
If the Kundalini becomes the chakras and the chakras become the Kundalini,

433
00:31:27,676 --> 00:31:32,570
how will you manage Sahaja Yoga? But we must assume

434
00:31:32,771 --> 00:31:37,871
our own nature in all dignity and in all pride;

435
00:31:38,057 --> 00:31:41,958
not to feel any way low down. Because a man sits on a horse,

436
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:45,403
the woman wants to sit on a horse.

437
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,880
What is the need for a woman to sit on a horse,

438
00:31:49,081 --> 00:31:51,771
I can’t understand. Here all the women are sitting on a horse.

439
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:54,185
They’ll become like horses.

440
00:31:54,386 --> 00:31:58,974
Already I think half of your royal family looks like horses,

441
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:01,919
don’t they?

442
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:05,411
I think so. Their faces look like horses.

443
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:09,072
See, so there is no need for women to do

444
00:32:09,097 --> 00:32:12,489
all the things that man have already done. Say, for example,

445
00:32:12,690 --> 00:32:16,989
there’s one personality of masculine personality that has to come

446
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,606
and do a certain job. Now you’ve done it.

447
00:32:20,807 --> 00:32:23,370
All right now the another personality has to do this job.

448
00:32:23,571 --> 00:32:27,511
Now see the situation of the Divine also.

449
00:32:28,525 --> 00:32:31,388
Now the whole complication comes in that

450
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:34,306
once a kind of a thing has been done,

451
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:38,462
the another one that comes wants to do the same.

452
00:32:38,663 --> 00:32:40,782
Do you follow My point?

453
00:32:40,983 --> 00:32:45,850
So the whole energy is completely wasted.

454
00:32:46,801 --> 00:32:49,182
The whole preparation has been made

455
00:32:49,207 --> 00:32:51,920
for this Aquarius age to come in

456
00:32:52,297 --> 00:32:54,764
to bring in the Kundalini upward

457
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:56,990
and to make the whole work out

458
00:32:57,191 --> 00:32:59,810
in such way that the left and right meet

459
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:06,193
and you all become ignited enlightened

460
00:33:06,394 --> 00:33:13,529
It was a question of our being sharing the whole job

461
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,545
in a proper understanding

462
00:33:15,746 --> 00:33:17,733
Now see how Mother Earth Herself was created,

463
00:33:17,934 --> 00:33:20,421
it is also a very simple thing

464
00:33:20,622 --> 00:33:28,873
First, the movement of the energy started flowing.

465
00:33:29,074 --> 00:33:32,139
Now this is a combined energy all right?

466
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:36,748
Then the combined energy went round and round and round like that.

467
00:33:36,949 --> 00:33:41,732
And when it consolidated there was a-this big bang.

468
00:33:41,933 --> 00:33:45,349
When big bang took place—now this is the manly work,

469
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,896
I should say in a way; manly style,

470
00:33:48,097 --> 00:33:51,459
because still the Mother earth is not produced—

471
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:56,920
so then these little fragments again went round and round.

472
00:33:57,121 --> 00:33:59,217
With the momentum, they became roundish.

473
00:33:59,418 --> 00:34:02,561
Out of them the Mother Earth was selected for one job.

474
00:34:02,762 --> 00:34:05,358
Not to do anything - you keep quiet now.

475
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:13,334
Alright. On the Mother Earth out of the water came the life—

476
00:34:13,535 --> 00:34:16,272
the carbon came in.

477
00:34:16,473 --> 00:34:20,592
Everybody helped there and a human being was created.

478
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,869
Then the men went round, to improve their societies

479
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:26,525
and whatever they have done to it, whatever was possible

480
00:34:26,726 --> 00:34:29,414
with their ego is done, finished now.

481
00:34:29,615 --> 00:34:34,899
Now they have done their job, you see. Now they are on dole,

482
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:37,352
you can say.

483
00:34:37,553 --> 00:34:42,399
Now the womb, or we can say the Kundalini

484
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,235
which has been waiting all these years, was resting,

485
00:34:45,436 --> 00:34:47,868
waiting for that time, isn’t it? So we call it:

486
00:34:48,069 --> 00:34:50,220
"the blossom time has now come".

487
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:56,392
At that time the Kundalini has to rise and ignite,

488
00:34:56,593 --> 00:35:00,945
in such a way that the completion of the whole work takes place—

489
00:35:01,146 --> 00:35:05,200
it is simple. Do you understand now?

490
00:35:05,834 --> 00:35:10,235
So there’s no competition between men or women,

491
00:35:10,436 --> 00:35:14,227
but the style of work is different.

492
00:35:14,428 --> 00:35:18,719
If you understand that, then only this kind of revolution

493
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,219
will take place and not turn out a rebellion.

494
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,453
Actually women are rebelling against men, and a nonsense it is.

495
00:35:24,654 --> 00:35:28,070
It is such a headache, that you create something,

496
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:30,912
allow them to grow, and the another party comes

497
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:35,193
which has to complete the job starts rebelling.

498
00:35:35,394 --> 00:35:39,354
So the revolution has to take place and this revolution is only possible

499
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:46,242
when we understand that what part is left out now to be done.

500
00:35:48,567 --> 00:35:51,655
Are you getting Me all right?

501
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:55,803
So that part is now Realization,

502
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:59,326
our awakening of the Kundalini.

503
00:35:59,527 --> 00:36:04,795
For that your feminine qualities are going to help you,

504
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,349
not your masculine qualities.

505
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:11,029
So aggressiveness must be given up by men.

506
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:13,482
Also, because they are Sahaja Yogis now,

507
00:36:13,683 --> 00:36:16,654
they have to take feminine qualities. Not of fighting.

508
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:19,545
If women fight they are not women.

509
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:22,850
You see, women are told that

510
00:36:23,051 --> 00:36:29,702
"you are useless, you are good for nothing",

511
00:36:29,903 --> 00:36:34,350
so now they are trying to show, ‘no’, we are also all right.

512
00:36:34,551 --> 00:36:39,457
If you have eaten one crow we will eat three."

513
00:36:41,417 --> 00:36:52,761
Now, this understanding and the wise perception would be such that

514
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,988
"what do we have to do now to change the mode

515
00:36:56,189 --> 00:36:58,519
and the style of our lives?"

516
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:01,222
What’s wrong here?

517
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:03,613
A turning point has come.

518
00:37:03,814 --> 00:37:10,769
Now the evolution is not rebellion, at all by any chance.

519
00:37:10,970 --> 00:37:14,566
It’s a wrong idea people have. It’s not rebellion,

520
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:17,099
that you hit me and I hit you—go on hitting each other,

521
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,982
like a pendulum you move; you see the movement of a pendulum.

522
00:37:20,183 --> 00:37:23,755
It’s not like a boom, this thing—that today you are born as a Muslim,

523
00:37:23,956 --> 00:37:26,496
tomorrow you are born as a Jew, then you are born as a Jew,

524
00:37:26,697 --> 00:37:28,871
then you are born as a Hindu, then you are born as—

525
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:33,184
it’s not pendulum. It is spiral movement.

526
00:37:33,385 --> 00:37:38,043
So every time you achieve an evolution

527
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:40,231
you are at a higher level than before.

528
00:37:40,432 --> 00:37:44,309
So the movement is spiral—see My point?

529
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:51,590
Now to achieve the higher position in our whole being

530
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,746
what should we do?

531
00:37:53,947 --> 00:37:57,637
Is to understand that from this point to that point we have to rise—

532
00:37:57,838 --> 00:38:05,714
we have to rise in a way that we move in such a way

533
00:38:05,915 --> 00:38:14,122
that it is not in a pendulum way but in a spiral way.

534
00:38:14,506 --> 00:38:21,485
And to move spirally, you have to use another kind of force.

535
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:26,305
Whatever you have used so far has to be endowed

536
00:38:26,506 --> 00:38:28,300
with another kind of force

537
00:38:28,501 --> 00:38:31,308
and that’s the feminine qualities of women.

538
00:38:31,509 --> 00:38:34,894
But where are the feminine women?

539
00:38:35,095 --> 00:38:39,050
They dress up like women, they will try to be feminine

540
00:38:39,251 --> 00:38:43,519
and all that. That’s not the way. From inside, from the heart.

541
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:49,386
A feminine heart. Christ showed that in His life—

542
00:38:49,587 --> 00:38:52,972
He forgave. Only a woman can forgive, man cannot,

543
00:38:53,173 --> 00:38:56,863
because he is aggressive. How can he forgive?

544
00:38:57,064 --> 00:39:00,886
Krishna never forgave anyone. He used to kill.

545
00:39:01,087 --> 00:39:08,540
Right royal fashion, go, all right? if you are so, all right. Done.

546
00:39:08,997 --> 00:39:12,007
He forgave to such an extent to show that

547
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:16,890
He is now giving a turn to the spiral

548
00:39:17,091 --> 00:39:22,023
and now a feminine quality has to be developed among human beings.

549
00:39:22,224 --> 00:39:25,211
But that doesn’t mean that you start walking like women

550
00:39:25,412 --> 00:39:30,162
or developing waistlines.

551
00:39:32,662 --> 00:39:35,727
Because that’s another stupidity.

552
00:39:35,928 --> 00:39:39,227
But to be Motherly.

553
00:39:39,428 --> 00:39:43,383
Not to be fatherly, but to be Motherly.

554
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:47,188
That kindness, that gentleness

555
00:39:47,389 --> 00:39:51,258
should be in your behavior towards each other.

556
00:39:51,459 --> 00:39:55,774
Of course this force also corrects, sometimes also gets angry also.

557
00:39:55,975 --> 00:39:58,540
Mother also has to get angry sometimes,

558
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:02,298
especially with people who never get all right with their behavior,

559
00:40:02,499 --> 00:40:04,837
She has to be shouting, punishing,

560
00:40:05,038 --> 00:40:09,321
and sometimes She also destroys; it’s all right.

561
00:40:09,522 --> 00:40:14,397
But that is sometimes, not all the time.

562
00:40:15,350 --> 00:40:20,766
So just now one has to accept that to be like the Mother Earth

563
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:24,282
we have to be forbearing—Dhara.

564
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:29,509
Daharaitey sadara. She is the sustenance of everything.

565
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:34,665
She takes everything, the vibrations are sucked in; see, talk about it.

566
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:37,431
And now for the first time after Realization,

567
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:42,251
you can give Her back what you have got it, from Her.

568
00:40:42,452 --> 00:40:44,695
You can give vibrations to Her trees that are created, y

569
00:40:44,896 --> 00:40:49,708
ou can make them beautiful. You can transform a flower

570
00:40:49,936 --> 00:40:53,001
into a more beautiful flower.

571
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:55,587
Now whatever you have got from the Mother Earth

572
00:40:55,788 --> 00:41:00,767
you can give because your Mother Earth is awakened within you now.

573
00:41:00,968 --> 00:41:01,968
So you return Her back everything that you got from Her

574
00:41:04,261 --> 00:41:08,826
and give it to others. Generosity, the greatness of heart,

575
00:41:09,027 --> 00:41:16,006
nobility, forgiveness, love, affection, bearing everything for love.

576
00:41:16,207 --> 00:41:20,467
And for the mother, to save her child, she’ll starve herself,

577
00:41:20,668 --> 00:41:24,303
she’ll do everything to save her child,

578
00:41:24,504 --> 00:41:28,287
complete dedication she has for her child.

579
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:31,874
That’s a real mother—I mean the kind of mothers you see these days,

580
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,818
neither they are mothers nor women. But what I am saying,

581
00:41:35,019 --> 00:41:41,050
that’s the real image of a mother, and you have a image before you.

582
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,387
So, this is what one has to develop now,

583
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:49,371
whether you are men or women as Sahaja Yogis

584
00:41:49,572 --> 00:41:53,551
you must develop a new consciousness of affection,

585
00:41:53,752 --> 00:41:56,676
love and compassion.

586
00:41:56,877 --> 00:42:01,481
Getting angry, getting into a temper, shouting at people,

587
00:42:01,682 --> 00:42:06,137
screaming at people—is not going to help you much.

588
00:42:06,338 --> 00:42:08,926
If you have to help the whole, the growth of the whole,

589
00:42:09,127 --> 00:42:13,434
try to make yourself a milder person—

590
00:42:13,635 --> 00:42:16,707
be angry with yourself that you are losing tempers

591
00:42:16,908 --> 00:42:21,387
and you are so unkind to others.

592
00:42:21,588 --> 00:42:26,278
All the problems have come out of the over-growth of the masculinity—

593
00:42:26,479 --> 00:42:28,841
over-growth. It reaches a certain point, you see,

594
00:42:29,042 --> 00:42:34,346
it’s reached such a wretched point now, that it has to come down.

595
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:42,046
But also femininity, at a lower level, without Realization

596
00:42:42,247 --> 00:42:46,819
could be very, very small hearted, chicken hearted,

597
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:51,645
could be all the time worried about her own child.

598
00:42:52,043 --> 00:42:55,600
That’s what one has to change—

599
00:42:55,801 --> 00:43:00,663
is to have love and affection for every Sahaja Yogi,

600
00:43:00,864 --> 00:43:04,338
for every person. When it comes to fighting others

601
00:43:04,539 --> 00:43:08,940
you are all one but among yourselves you can look after each other,

602
00:43:09,141 --> 00:43:12,534
tell them—say for example, something is paining in my nose here,

603
00:43:12,735 --> 00:43:15,292
I will just try to rub it in the same way.

604
00:43:15,493 --> 00:43:20,698
But I won’t try to cut my nose will I? Or bang my nose, I won’t?

605
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:25,843
So the feeling that the other is myself; be kind and gentle—

606
00:43:26,044 --> 00:43:29,374
try to improve and help in that manner.

607
00:43:29,575 --> 00:43:32,140
I hope you have understood the whole thing.

608
00:43:32,341 --> 00:43:36,029
In a nutshell is that: we have to change the whole mode—

609
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:41,131
a radical change has to come in the society of Sahaja Yogis.

610
00:43:41,332 --> 00:43:46,613
Now, if there is any question you ask Me, before we start the puja.

611
00:43:48,832 --> 00:43:53,823
Now the problem of divorce and all that, you can see this respect.

612
00:44:04,931 --> 00:44:10,188
Left Nabhi problem, we can talk to.

613
00:44:37,687 --> 00:44:40,988
What is it?

614
00:44:46,282 --> 00:44:48,602
See.

615
00:44:50,180 --> 00:44:55,292
This problem comes in where you are not the whole.

616
00:44:55,493 --> 00:44:57,292
All right?

617
00:44:57,493 --> 00:45:01,440
Now supposing, as I told you, if you are the whole,

618
00:45:01,641 --> 00:45:05,391
then who is the other?

619
00:45:06,594 --> 00:45:09,666
Then you will, even if you have to hurt. Say, for example,

620
00:45:09,867 --> 00:45:13,854
if there is blood coming out of my thumb,

621
00:45:14,055 --> 00:45:18,260
I press it hard to stop the blood. It will hurt the thumb, thing.

622
00:45:18,461 --> 00:45:21,462
But the discrimination must be used, that I'm loosing my blood

623
00:45:21,663 --> 00:45:23,961
which is precious, much more precious than this finger

624
00:45:24,162 --> 00:45:27,380
it will hurt.

625
00:45:28,904 --> 00:45:30,937
But that discretion must be achieved, you see.

626
00:45:31,138 --> 00:45:33,031
In Sahaja Yoga, you're all free to develop

627
00:45:33,232 --> 00:45:35,203
your sense of discretion.

628
00:45:35,404 --> 00:45:37,292
And once you develop your sense of discretion,

629
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:39,847
gradually you will know what to do. In the beginning you will hurt,

630
00:45:40,048 --> 00:45:42,488
no doubt, because you are used to that.

631
00:45:42,689 --> 00:45:45,105
I've seen people here, just barking at each other,

632
00:45:45,306 --> 00:45:48,300
as soon as they see each other they start barking.

633
00:45:48,501 --> 00:45:50,691
You go anywhere in the whole country you go anywhere,

634
00:45:50,892 --> 00:45:52,910
they start barking for nothing at all. I was surprised.

635
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:54,332
In a school, I went there,

636
00:45:54,533 --> 00:45:56,777
there also everybody is barking at each other, you know.

637
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:59,582
Whether they are drunk or not drunk, makes no difference-

638
00:45:59,783 --> 00:46:04,425
is the same state. But after Realization, you do say.

639
00:46:04,626 --> 00:46:09,269
Because you feel concerned, you're worried.

640
00:46:09,470 --> 00:46:14,308
But you say in such a way that you achieve the result.

641
00:46:14,509 --> 00:46:17,347
See My point is-that is the criteria:

642
00:46:17,548 --> 00:46:21,407
that you should achieve the results.

643
00:46:22,251 --> 00:46:24,652
But, supposing a man has come for the first time, and tell him

644
00:46:24,853 --> 00:46:27,386
that "you are a bhoot",

645
00:46:27,587 --> 00:46:31,714
then naturally he will be hurt;

646
00:46:31,915 --> 00:46:35,415
very common.

647
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:40,730
First day, somebody walks in and you say "you are a bhoot".

648
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,764
I mean, thank God if he doesn't understand the meaning

649
00:46:42,965 --> 00:46:47,300
of the word bhoot -then it's all right.

650
00:46:51,268 --> 00:46:56,395
But first you think of being gentle, nice,

651
00:46:56,596 --> 00:47:01,653
embalming, sweet. Let's see, find out ways and methods;

652
00:47:01,854 --> 00:47:04,755
there's a very good way-in the evening, to write down

653
00:47:04,956 --> 00:47:09,323
"how many sweet things I've said today."

654
00:47:14,401 --> 00:47:16,708
Not like this, sweet things we say,

655
00:47:16,909 --> 00:47:20,028
"You're looking beautiful" all that.

656
00:47:20,229 --> 00:47:25,260
Not the superficial ones. That may pamper the ego.

657
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:28,567
But they're so sweet you know, things are.

658
00:47:28,768 --> 00:47:35,114
Let's say

659
00:47:35,315 --> 00:47:37,934
there are some very good words,

660
00:47:38,135 --> 00:47:42,486
you can say, like-"Are you warm enough?"

661
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:47,184
-very sweet way of asking a question. Then, it's very simple;

662
00:47:47,385 --> 00:47:49,144
but you can say like that.

663
00:47:49,345 --> 00:47:52,839
Just-it's very difficult for people to say that even, I've seen.

664
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:56,386
Looking after others comforts. Somebody is sitting, he wants water.

665
00:47:56,587 --> 00:48:00,330
Awkwardly sitting. You just go rush and given him water.

666
00:48:00,531 --> 00:48:06,190
Oh that's too much to expect. That, Oh God you gave water,

667
00:48:06,391 --> 00:48:10,393
"I'm not his servant"-immediately the question comes into the head.

668
00:48:10,594 --> 00:48:14,557
Little bit trying to do something here and there.

669
00:48:14,758 --> 00:48:19,440
Or sometimes thinking-going in the market,

670
00:48:19,641 --> 00:48:23,174
you find something. "Oh let me take it for him".

671
00:48:23,375 --> 00:48:25,507
Children do. I've seen children all the time;

672
00:48:25,708 --> 00:48:32,583
they think of their friends-what they can buy for others.

673
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:36,824
"This is good for my friend, this is good for..."

674
00:48:37,025 --> 00:48:38,660
She's very fond of things, she "likes. . ."

675
00:48:38,861 --> 00:48:41,207
All these little-little things, you know.

676
00:48:41,408 --> 00:48:43,340
Sometimes even a small thing

677
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:44,942
like; early in the morning you get up,

678
00:48:45,143 --> 00:48:47,677
you find the another person is sleeping on one side,

679
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:52,505
his blanket on the third side and his pillow in the fourth side.

680
00:48:52,706 --> 00:48:54,464
So you just put his head on the pillow

681
00:48:54,665 --> 00:48:58,956
and cover him with the blanket. That's mother's job.

682
00:49:02,299 --> 00:49:07,252
Not out of fear, but out of sheer love.

683
00:49:09,226 --> 00:49:12,017
Like even if it is cold and buttons are open,

684
00:49:12,218 --> 00:49:16,431
you can button up a person you like. Little-little things you know.

685
00:49:16,632 --> 00:49:19,244
Women have very little-sweet things which they do,

686
00:49:19,445 --> 00:49:25,359
which makes men very happy. But women have lost now, that sense.

687
00:49:29,839 --> 00:49:32,003
Not the fighting, but thinking of

688
00:49:32,204 --> 00:49:34,511
what sweet things you can do for him.

689
00:49:34,712 --> 00:49:38,844
And also, sometimes teasing is all right.

690
00:49:40,446 --> 00:49:43,815
Sometimes tickling is all right.

691
00:49:44,016 --> 00:49:50,307
But a kind of a sweet you see rapport between each other;

692
00:49:50,508 --> 00:49:56,281
even the feeling, that we can do that. It's a master's job.

693
00:49:56,985 --> 00:49:59,943
Is a master's job. The one who is a master can do it,

694
00:50:00,144 --> 00:50:02,290
those who are not, will not be able to.

695
00:50:02,491 --> 00:50:06,031
They'll again come back to hurt. Ultimately, they'll land up

696
00:50:06,056 --> 00:50:09,115
with hurting or biting or coming to blows.

697
00:50:09,140 --> 00:50:12,088
But those who are masters will be so beautifully doing

698
00:50:12,289 --> 00:50:18,158
the whole job that you see a kind of a very sweet relationship-

699
00:50:18,359 --> 00:50:21,044
it's called Madhurya. Without any lust,

700
00:50:21,069 --> 00:50:24,980
without any money-business, anything. Such sweet relationships.

701
00:50:25,181 --> 00:50:29,485
And the joy would be bubbling.

702
00:50:30,634 --> 00:50:33,363
All these perversions, all these things will drop off.

703
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:38,064
But a very sweet relationship-

704
00:50:43,142 --> 00:50:49,009
all right? Even saying that, you are feeling happy.
