1
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,580
﻿So today we have come here to Spain,

2
00:00:09,517 --> 00:00:16,056
and there are so many
other Spanish Sahaja Yogis here,

3
00:00:30,277 --> 00:00:36,771
and you all have met them. By that,
they are very much strengthened in Sahaja Yoga,

4
00:00:42,602 --> 00:00:47,360
that they feel that
they have brothers and sisters all over the world.

5
00:00:52,732 --> 00:00:56,732
Because in Spain there are very few Sahaja Yogis

6
00:00:57,790 --> 00:01:04,618
and they feel quite lost because they are so few.

7
00:01:14,707 --> 00:01:17,553
But by your coming here,

8
00:01:17,754 --> 00:01:23,460
it is a kind of a one hand helping another hand.

9
00:01:33,378 --> 00:01:39,748
Now Spain is developing materially,

10
00:01:45,904 --> 00:01:49,640
and it is . . .

11
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:53,681
this time they have to be careful:

12
00:01:58,665 --> 00:02:06,280
They need not go all the
way to the overdeveloped state

13
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,730
and then suffer,

14
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:21,998
and that suffering should not

15
00:02:22,888 --> 00:02:28,640
become a kind of a punishment to
them like in many affluent countries.

16
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:45,000
Because as materialism grows,

17
00:02:46,896 --> 00:02:50,010
it tries to overpower human beings.

18
00:02:56,995 --> 00:03:00,840
But if after realization,

19
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:08,000
the materialism starts growing,
you master the matter.

20
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:21,370
Then matter doesn’t sit on your head,

21
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,150
because with realization you have discretion.

22
00:03:32,484 --> 00:03:36,118
And actually, materialism is,

23
00:03:36,374 --> 00:03:40,874
to be understood through
Lakshmi Tattwa, Lakshmi principal.

24
00:03:51,629 --> 00:03:57,379
If you develop the wisdom in Sahaj Yoga,

25
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:06,440
then you understand how
far to go with materialism.

26
00:04:12,374 --> 00:04:16,374
Matter is for you, you are not for the matter.

27
00:04:21,145 --> 00:04:25,240
Now I’ll tell you, gradually
how matter sits on our head.

28
00:04:31,182 --> 00:04:33,767
Before realization,

29
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:40,640
first we start using the matter for our comfort.

30
00:04:46,004 --> 00:04:49,223
Through science, we develop ways and methods

31
00:04:49,423 --> 00:04:54,016
by which we develop a,

32
00:04:55,735 --> 00:05:00,208
life which gives you more comfort.

33
00:05:07,345 --> 00:05:14,280
In the beginning, it is all right that we
get sufficient food, a proper house to live in;

34
00:05:23,377 --> 00:05:28,220
but by that time we have already
become the slave of the matter.

35
00:05:34,696 --> 00:05:37,696
But matter is a dead thing.

36
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:43,430
We just change the forms of matter –

37
00:05:46,517 --> 00:05:49,017
from dead to dead –

38
00:05:51,750 --> 00:05:54,750
but we cannot do any living work.

39
00:05:57,636 --> 00:06:01,040
Now, this matter starts giving us habits,

40
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:08,873
then we cannot get out of those habits,

41
00:06:12,018 --> 00:06:15,800
and gradually we start becoming slave of matter.

42
00:06:19,882 --> 00:06:22,694
It does not go that far.

43
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:28,960
Now, if you have too many machineries,

44
00:06:32,174 --> 00:06:36,520
you produce things out of proportion.

45
00:06:42,392 --> 00:06:45,290
Like you have so many cars.

46
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,240
In Paris, everybody is on the road only.

47
00:06:54,283 --> 00:06:57,920
As soon as you are on the road,
you are on the road all the time.

48
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,275
Better to be in the house.

49
00:07:06,216 --> 00:07:09,320
And you spend hours together.

50
00:07:13,168 --> 00:07:16,168
Then you start producing other things.

51
00:07:18,992 --> 00:07:24,360
Like, supposing they are producing clothes:

52
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:31,145
the factories have to run –

53
00:07:34,585 --> 00:07:37,428
you cannot stop the factory.

54
00:07:39,075 --> 00:07:43,633
So then they start producing things such a lot,

55
00:07:43,833 --> 00:07:46,512
they don’t know how to sell it.

56
00:07:50,884 --> 00:07:54,600
Then they say that,
“All right, let us have fashions.”

57
00:07:59,378 --> 00:08:03,400
Then these manufacturers float fashion houses.

58
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:11,185
Now the fashion starts.

59
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:16,160
With that, everybody
changes their clothes every year.

60
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:22,120
They have to be according to the fashion,

61
00:08:24,085 --> 00:08:26,850
such a lot of money is wasted,

62
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,019
but we also lose our individuality.

63
00:08:37,703 --> 00:08:43,120
In America, they play another trick,
also here I think – must be everywhere.

64
00:08:47,846 --> 00:08:52,371
Every year they produce a new type of handles,

65
00:08:52,571 --> 00:08:57,400
new type of tiles, new type of bathrooms.

66
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:08,959
If you go to an American house,
better ask about the bathroom,

67
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:17,535
otherwise when you enter in, maybe,

68
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:22,431
you may be just drenched with
water with some showers falling on you.

69
00:09:26,991 --> 00:09:32,120
Or you may sit in the tub, and you may
press it and the whole tub might come like that.

70
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:41,725
Their beds are also funny; you may press
on some button and the whole bed may come up.

71
00:09:47,884 --> 00:09:52,558
They have beds where they just
can fold on this part, or that part –

72
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:58,960
it is terrible, I mean if you press some buttons,
you might be going into acrobats all the time.

73
00:10:05,379 --> 00:10:08,168
There is no need to do all that.

74
00:10:10,334 --> 00:10:14,960
But when you have out-of-proportion
machineries, then you have to do it,

75
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:26,197
but that is how you become
slaves of these entrepreneurs.

76
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:35,281
But in Sahaja Yoga, when you come in,

77
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,480
you know how to do living work.

78
00:10:45,257 --> 00:10:49,454
Like in the affluent countries,

79
00:10:49,654 --> 00:10:53,720
they use seeds which are hybrid.

80
00:10:59,631 --> 00:11:01,724
Hybrid.

81
00:11:07,417 --> 00:11:12,106
These hybrid seeds are of no nourishment to us,

82
00:11:12,307 --> 00:11:15,120
they are no good for our brains, they confuse us.

83
00:11:22,671 --> 00:11:28,200
Especially the hybrid animals,
their milk confuses us.

84
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:38,320
Hybrid animals themselves are very confused.

85
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,685
But in Sahaja Yoga,

86
00:11:45,886 --> 00:11:49,629
you take the ordinary seeds

87
00:11:54,149 --> 00:11:56,695
and you vibrate them.

88
00:11:57,806 --> 00:12:01,274
If you vibrate them, then what happens,

89
00:12:01,475 --> 00:12:09,475
that you start getting seeds
which are even better than hybrid.

90
00:12:17,489 --> 00:12:22,720
I tried an experiment with a sunflower.

91
00:12:27,395 --> 00:12:31,720
So, I developed a sunflower about 2 kilos weight,

92
00:12:35,287 --> 00:12:38,520
about one foot diameter,

93
00:12:42,813 --> 00:12:47,560
and such big, big seeds that you can’t
make them out to be sunflower seeds.

94
00:12:54,269 --> 00:12:58,440
So the collective was so amazed at it,

95
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:06,720
and they felt that this
kind of seed will solve all our oil problem.

96
00:13:11,521 --> 00:13:14,623
Same thing happens with the animals.

97
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:21,040
You take an ordinary cow, Indian ordinary cow,

98
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:28,960
and you give her vibrated water to drink,

99
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:38,080
and she gives
about the same milk as an Australian cow.

100
00:13:44,388 --> 00:13:49,400
But the Australian cow’s milk
can make you confused and mad

101
00:13:56,302 --> 00:14:01,400
because we have seen that the Australian cows,

102
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:07,731
when they are in India, they don’t know
where they stand, they just run amok,

103
00:14:16,057 --> 00:14:18,892
so what must be their milk?

104
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:27,480
But an Indian cow, if she gets
realization through this vibrated water,

105
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:31,480
she gives milk which is very good for the brain.

106
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:48,958
So that is how we improve the
quality of our animals by Sahaja Yoga.

107
00:14:56,852 --> 00:15:00,229
Now regarding matter, we have to understand

108
00:15:00,429 --> 00:15:04,320
that matter is only good for giving it to others,

109
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:16,480
but if it is given by a realized soul,

110
00:15:19,579 --> 00:15:22,079
it has tremendous effects.

111
00:15:25,979 --> 00:15:30,400
Before Gregoire wanted to write
his book, I gave him a fountain pen,

112
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,600
and he said, “I never
wrote a book,” and he started writing so well.

113
00:15:50,752 --> 00:15:54,440
Same with Rustom; he became a scholar.

114
00:15:59,029 --> 00:16:02,880
So, Sahaja Yoga gives you

115
00:16:14,086 --> 00:16:17,250
an additional power

116
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:28,288
by which you can neutralize
the bad effects of materialism.

117
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:41,040
Now, say, supposing in India, in England,

118
00:16:41,545 --> 00:16:44,920
you have to offer drinks to people.

119
00:16:51,007 --> 00:16:54,320
So there are ten types of
glasses you have to have.

120
00:17:00,348 --> 00:17:02,996
Only one is sufficient

121
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:07,760
to drink anything;
why to have ten? It’s a headache.

122
00:17:13,124 --> 00:17:17,582
Now if you have to use spoons and
forks, then you have all elaborations,

123
00:17:17,782 --> 00:17:21,480
and you can have a ten-place setting.

124
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,920
But if you can use your
hands, they are very clean—

125
00:17:36,570 --> 00:17:39,749
need not have so many elaborations.

126
00:17:42,167 --> 00:17:45,755
But these elaborations we
have not because we want them,

127
00:17:45,955 --> 00:17:50,280
but because of these
entrepreneurs – they force on us.

128
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:01,658
But there is a deeper influence:

129
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:08,115
how people control you through matter.

130
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:16,280
Now, supposing they go to somebody’s house,

131
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:26,629
and they find a kind of a spoon missing –
because there could be a spoon for avocado,

132
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:29,720
say, a special spoon for avocado.

133
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:38,435
Now if that spoon is not there, they will say,

134
00:18:38,635 --> 00:18:42,993
“Oh, these people have no sense,”

135
00:18:48,692 --> 00:18:53,040
and they will ask:
“Have you got a spoon for avocado?”

136
00:18:59,232 --> 00:19:03,048
So it is very shameless and it is very arrogant,

137
00:19:06,651 --> 00:19:09,486
to insult another person.

138
00:19:11,928 --> 00:19:17,016
A housewife, supposing you are a guest,

139
00:19:17,216 --> 00:19:21,200
she will be more worried about
her carpet than about her guests.

140
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:34,920
And this kind of a thing can go too
far, and a person can become very dry.

141
00:19:41,016 --> 00:19:45,584
Such people are very disgusting

142
00:19:48,573 --> 00:19:53,283
and insulting type, an insulting.

143
00:19:57,535 --> 00:20:01,850
There is another way they
control you through matter,

144
00:20:05,957 --> 00:20:10,908
that they will say that

145
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:16,563
now you have to say, for a husband,

146
00:20:16,763 --> 00:20:21,160
“You must get me this,
otherwise I will be very angry.”

147
00:20:27,874 --> 00:20:32,560
If the husband breaks one
cup, the wife will be on his head,

148
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:42,840
as if the cup is more important than the husband.

149
00:20:46,173 --> 00:20:50,487
She can get another husband,
she can also get another cup.

150
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:59,520
See, the whole human dignity is reduced to matter,

151
00:21:05,275 --> 00:21:08,480
and this kind of controlling goes on.

152
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,186
Children also control parents.

153
00:21:17,473 --> 00:21:23,360
They see on the television some
sort of a toy, and they ask the parents.

154
00:21:29,278 --> 00:21:33,121
Now if the parents don’t give
the toy, they will not eat their food.

155
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:42,200
They’ll cry and weep and trouble the parents.

156
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:48,920
So then the parents: “All right,
get them the toy, let them have it.”

157
00:21:51,869 --> 00:21:55,869
And the child plays with
the toy, not with the parents.

158
00:22:00,383 --> 00:22:05,706
Now two friends will meet, and they’ll
say, “We must go and see a film together.”

159
00:22:09,062 --> 00:22:13,320
They don’t talk to each other,
there’s no rapport, there’s no friendship.

160
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,240
They must have something in between them.

161
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:26,910
There is no direct rapport between
the children, between the friends,

162
00:22:27,111 --> 00:22:29,753
between husband and wife.

163
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:39,360
Matter is to beautify your life,

164
00:22:42,317 --> 00:22:45,012
not to make it ugly

165
00:22:47,473 --> 00:22:50,600
and create problems between each other.

166
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:57,636
Now the French will not like the English

167
00:22:57,837 --> 00:23:02,880
because they use their fork
and knives in a different way.

168
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:14,041
And the English think no end of themselves

169
00:23:14,242 --> 00:23:17,275
because they know the English language.

170
00:23:23,305 --> 00:23:29,360
All this kind of nonsensical feelings
come in through this kind of materialism,

171
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:38,880
and we are no more collective,

172
00:23:40,759 --> 00:23:43,720
and the collectivity gets lost.

173
00:23:45,494 --> 00:23:51,053
But then we find out wrong
methods to get into collectivity.

174
00:23:57,821 --> 00:24:00,569
Like, we take to alcoholism,

175
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:06,285
because after alcohol we feel abandoned
and we can laugh and enjoy together.

176
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,400
So, otherwise, if not, we go for holiday.

177
00:24:21,811 --> 00:24:24,680
All the women must show off their body

178
00:24:27,309 --> 00:24:29,920
to attract the attention of men.

179
00:24:32,909 --> 00:24:37,520
Men must show off their bodies
to attract the attention of women,

180
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:43,891
but no one knows, no one

181
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:50,976
– it’s a joyless pursuit.

182
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:59,000
And the way they quarrel among
themselves for all these small, small things,

183
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,871
they are really joy-killers.

184
00:25:09,014 --> 00:25:13,480
As a result of all these
things, we have lost the art,

185
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:17,624
we have lost the art,

186
00:25:21,671 --> 00:25:26,765
we have lost the deftness, the deftness;

187
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:34,861
and now wherever you go, what you find ugly things

188
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:41,687
like the airport of Charles de Gaulle

189
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:54,670
— it looks like a factory, and I don’t
know how you feel in that place.

190
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:02,120
There is no cosiness in the household;

191
00:26:07,195 --> 00:26:11,040
the house is so bare and so insipid,

192
00:26:13,481 --> 00:26:16,527
and the people are so dry and stupid.

193
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:23,116
There’s no joy in the family, so also
the children run away from the houses

194
00:26:23,316 --> 00:26:28,385
at the age of eighteen,
or sixteen, whatever may be the case.

195
00:26:34,158 --> 00:26:38,320
So instead of human beings,
we start creating robots, you see,

196
00:26:42,387 --> 00:26:45,000
controlled by entrepreneurs.

197
00:26:47,629 --> 00:26:52,076
This is the situation.
That’s why you play into the hands

198
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:57,800
of all kinds of things like
psychologists, like Freud.

199
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,880
Any new idea comes in, they jump at it,

200
00:27:12,751 --> 00:27:18,120
and that’s how they suffer – the
result is they have got AIDS now.

201
00:27:23,452 --> 00:27:26,600
There’s no logic in their heads.

202
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:33,721
They don’t understand
that this is just exploitation.

203
00:27:36,461 --> 00:27:40,920
After Sahaja Yoga, you do
understand this is exploitation.

204
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:49,040
Now they have plastics and nylons,

205
00:27:52,185 --> 00:27:57,960
and they don’t know what to do
with the plastic, how to get rid of it.

206
00:28:01,823 --> 00:28:06,360
Then they have acid rains, acid rains

207
00:28:10,177 --> 00:28:16,760
and the trees are affected by that.

208
00:28:24,018 --> 00:28:29,920
Now in Switzerland—which is
such a corrupt country, I should say,

209
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,920
it is taking the money, corrupt
money, from every country

210
00:28:41,078 --> 00:28:44,390
—who are absolute materialists

211
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:50,080
are suffering from this acid rain.

212
00:28:54,604 --> 00:28:57,480
Most of their trees are destroyed

213
00:29:00,404 --> 00:29:07,036
and they have avalanches. All these
big, big mountains that they have,

214
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:12,753
the ice starts flowing downward
because nobody can hold it,

215
00:29:18,897 --> 00:29:21,490
and now there are floods.

216
00:29:24,446 --> 00:29:28,079
The nature starts acting.

217
00:29:32,684 --> 00:29:38,680
So, whether they progress
outward in this wrong direction,

218
00:29:39,316 --> 00:29:45,960
or they try things inwards like Freudian methods

219
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:49,120
– both are dangerous

220
00:30:01,296 --> 00:30:03,841
and are destructive,

221
00:30:05,048 --> 00:30:07,558
and in this destruction,

222
00:30:07,759 --> 00:30:12,634
who are lost are the people who are innocent.

223
00:30:19,634 --> 00:30:24,040
So, one has to develop that wisdom within oneself,

224
00:30:27,423 --> 00:30:33,120
that we are human beings here,
part and parcel of one whole,

225
00:30:40,804 --> 00:30:46,800
and only the human beings can get
Self-Realization and can feel that oneness.

226
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,320
And such a personality is a satisfied personality.

227
00:31:02,786 --> 00:31:06,200
They do not try to exploit other countries,

228
00:31:08,509 --> 00:31:11,240
other people;

229
00:31:11,588 --> 00:31:14,088
they live satisfied with themselves.

230
00:31:17,041 --> 00:31:20,920
They enjoy their compassion and their generosity.

231
00:31:23,713 --> 00:31:26,720
They open their houses to everyone,

232
00:31:29,146 --> 00:31:32,440
they open their hearts to everyone.

233
00:31:34,255 --> 00:31:38,535
They make their houses beautiful
for others, not for themselves.

234
00:31:43,879 --> 00:31:47,880
We were first in London in a country house,

235
00:31:50,311 --> 00:31:53,040
and there were six other houses;

236
00:31:55,311 --> 00:31:58,330
there were quite rich people living there.

237
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:05,097
Every Saturday, Sunday, the
poor husband had to mow the lawn,

238
00:32:05,297 --> 00:32:10,320
and the wife would stand
up, telling him, “Do it better,”

239
00:32:18,207 --> 00:32:24,040
and used to polish all the brass, you see.

240
00:32:29,005 --> 00:32:31,505
Same with his wife.

241
00:32:33,161 --> 00:32:39,040
And not even a rat would enter that house.

242
00:32:42,365 --> 00:32:46,040
And they were surprised that in our house

243
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:54,080
there were so many people coming.

244
00:32:56,061 --> 00:33:01,880
And they came and saw our house and
were surprised that our house was so beautiful

245
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:05,040
and so neat and clean.

246
00:33:12,427 --> 00:33:16,760
I told them that if you
really have a beautiful house,

247
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,600
even children don’t want to disturb it;

248
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:29,560
they treat the house like a temple.

249
00:33:31,962 --> 00:33:38,440
But if you do not make the house
beautiful and acceptable to others,

250
00:33:43,795 --> 00:33:49,133
then you are only busy
cleaning for yourself all the brass,

251
00:33:49,333 --> 00:33:54,320
all the crystal, all the
glass, everything yourself.

252
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,280
And what is the purpose?

253
00:34:08,299 --> 00:34:12,000
Then Monday you are
again tired, sitting very tired,

254
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:20,560
but if you had kept the doors open
to others, they would have enjoyed.

255
00:34:25,251 --> 00:34:28,251
Then it had some purpose.

256
00:34:30,041 --> 00:34:34,000
So purposeless life is absolutely joyless.

257
00:34:39,254 --> 00:34:45,600
That is the problem, is that people
get exhausted for nonsensical things.

258
00:34:53,245 --> 00:34:58,400
If one spoon is lost,
they will just die ten times.

259
00:35:04,279 --> 00:35:08,999
Thank God, in India, we are not
such materialists—yet, we might.

260
00:35:12,302 --> 00:35:15,800
We might become but can't say.

261
00:35:16,062 --> 00:35:21,520
but we have now a short circuit: we are
coming to Sahaja Yoga before we are developing.

262
00:35:28,805 --> 00:35:32,875
Now the culture is also very
different and is an ancient culture.

263
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:43,013
That should be the culture of
Sahaja Yogis – will be that culture.

264
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:56,080
Like, now, if somebody spills any coffee say,

265
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,868
nobody will say anything—“Oh it’s all right,
it’s all right, no, no, no it doesn’t matter”

266
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:03,720
—even if it’s a Persian carpet.

267
00:36:11,279 --> 00:36:14,960
Until the guest is in the
house, you will not wipe it.

268
00:36:19,419 --> 00:36:22,577
Even if children break
something, we don’t punish them,

269
00:36:22,777 --> 00:36:27,280
that: “You have broken this and it’s
very wrong, you have broken that.”

270
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,920
Nothing of the kind. “It’s all
right, you be careful” – that’s all.

271
00:36:36,698 --> 00:36:38,960
We don’t scold them for that,

272
00:36:42,432 --> 00:36:46,680
but we tell them that, “You
be careful, you might get hurt.”

273
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:52,150
No importance is given to things.

274
00:36:54,476 --> 00:36:58,800
Also, in language, we cannot
say to somebody: “I hate you.”

275
00:37:03,906 --> 00:37:06,560
That’s not allowed.

276
00:37:07,072 --> 00:37:10,000
Or “I don’t like you,”

277
00:37:11,473 --> 00:37:13,973
or “I believe in this.”

278
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:17,819
They will say: “Who are you?

279
00:37:19,378 --> 00:37:21,880
What do you think of yourself?”

280
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:25,480
The parents will immediately correct,

281
00:37:29,749 --> 00:37:33,765
and that is the correcting point
which helps throughout the life.

282
00:37:33,966 --> 00:37:38,600
You don’t say harsh things like:
“I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

283
00:37:47,026 --> 00:37:49,893
We have to appreciate everything:

284
00:37:53,115 --> 00:37:55,760
learn to appreciate other human beings,

285
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:01,670
to enjoy other people,

286
00:38:03,907 --> 00:38:06,407
to see to their good points.

287
00:38:08,584 --> 00:38:14,160
If you see only their bad points, you will
get all their bad points. Where is your attention?

288
00:38:20,485 --> 00:38:26,160
Instead of getting too many plastics,
you have one little nice thing with you.

289
00:38:32,422 --> 00:38:35,240
That is something joy-giving.

290
00:38:38,713 --> 00:38:41,360
Keep your houses open to others.

291
00:38:44,474 --> 00:38:47,800
Don’t get worried how your door is

292
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,835
– if somebody touches the door it
might spoil its polish or something like that.

293
00:38:59,016 --> 00:39:03,453
Enjoy looking after others,
having concern for them.

294
00:39:08,217 --> 00:39:13,800
They always say, “Mother, You look so
young despite Your age and You work so hard.”

295
00:39:20,093 --> 00:39:24,414
It is because I love everyone
much more than I care for Myself

296
00:39:30,082 --> 00:39:33,320
because I have so much concern for everyone.

297
00:39:35,785 --> 00:39:38,285
That keeps Me very happy.

298
00:39:40,195 --> 00:39:44,080
If I could give something to
others, that makes Me very happy.

299
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:53,240
If I can cook for everyone, that’s very good.

300
00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:03,017
Only, I think, two years back, I went to

301
00:40:05,218 --> 00:40:07,595
– that’s about three years back

302
00:40:07,795 --> 00:40:13,101
– I went to Australia and cooked for
five hundred people in two places

303
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:24,880
and enjoyed really seeing them enjoy My food.

304
00:40:27,978 --> 00:40:30,560
It was such a joy-giving thing.

305
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:36,280
The greatest joy is in giving others.

306
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:42,172
As soon as this attitude changes,

307
00:40:42,372 --> 00:40:47,402
you’ll be amazed the
materialism will be at your feet

308
00:40:54,101 --> 00:40:58,956
because in Sahaja Yoga it works that way.

309
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:05,280
I’ll give you an example.

310
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:09,263
Once I was going for a Guru Puja,

311
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:14,854
and I wanted to take some
presents for all the leaders.

312
00:41:21,684 --> 00:41:28,045
In London, I don’t go out shopping, but I went
out, and I was exhausted. I couldn’t get anything,

313
00:41:33,776 --> 00:41:39,240
and I came in the evening very
tired and there was nothing I could find,

314
00:41:43,955 --> 00:41:50,160
and I thought that, I better now open My
storeroom and try to find out something there.

315
00:41:55,766 --> 00:42:02,000
And at that time, a Sahaja Yogi just said, “Mother
there’s some boy who wants to sell his paintings.”

316
00:42:09,582 --> 00:42:12,680
I just came rushing down,

317
00:42:15,044 --> 00:42:18,800
and he had beautiful paintings with him

318
00:42:20,875 --> 00:42:24,760
at a very reasonable price that I could afford,

319
00:42:28,335 --> 00:42:31,400
and they were exactly the number I wanted.

320
00:42:34,943 --> 00:42:41,080
So I bought them, and you know in one of the
Guru pujas I gave beautiful paintings to everyone.

321
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:51,840
This time I had no time to buy any presents

322
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:56,320
for the leaders; I was going to France and here.

323
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:07,400
I thought, I must have
something and now what to do?

324
00:43:12,115 --> 00:43:18,880
I have to take something for
Jose Antonio and also for Patrick.

325
00:43:23,223 --> 00:43:25,920
So, our plane was delayed,

326
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:33,000
and I got beautiful
fountain pens for both of them.

327
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:41,418
I was so very happy I could buy them there.

328
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,550
It’s so nice, you see, to buy for others.

329
00:43:49,617 --> 00:43:52,840
I find it difficult to buy anything for Myself.

330
00:43:57,095 --> 00:44:03,840
It is so many times I have seen how
suddenly you get the things that you want,

331
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,520
as the matter is at your feet.

332
00:44:16,710 --> 00:44:19,662
I had bought some chocolates for the children

333
00:44:19,863 --> 00:44:26,400
for the puja in – not puja, but visit to Paris,

334
00:44:31,427 --> 00:44:36,160
and when they came in the
evening for music, we forgot about it.

335
00:44:41,875 --> 00:44:44,840
But at the airport we suddenly found them,

336
00:44:48,234 --> 00:44:53,360
so I gave all that to small
children and to big children also,

337
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:00,720
and we had a nice time at the airport.

338
00:45:02,576 --> 00:45:07,880
All these small, small things give
so much of joy, such an ocean of joy!

339
00:45:12,681 --> 00:45:15,410
You just try these things.

340
00:45:19,215 --> 00:45:22,360
In the beginning of Sahaj Yoga,

341
00:45:23,136 --> 00:45:28,805
I had gone for a program to meet
the Sahaja Yogis at Gavin’s place,

342
00:45:36,254 --> 00:45:38,386
At Gavin's place.

343
00:45:40,341 --> 00:45:44,358
and his wife was no good for
– she was cooking and all that,

344
00:45:44,558 --> 00:45:47,411
she was schizophrenic type,

345
00:45:52,177 --> 00:45:56,080
but Gavin said, “Mother, will you
please have Your dinner with us?”

346
00:46:00,397 --> 00:46:03,643
So I thought, he has cooked only for Me,

347
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:10,720
so I allowed everybody to go away,

348
00:46:13,881 --> 00:46:16,480
and he was in the kitchen.

349
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:20,643
He came out and said, “Mother, where are they?”

350
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:29,080
I said, “Why? They have gone away.”

351
00:46:31,569 --> 00:46:35,120
He said, “See, Mother,
I have cooked for all of them,

352
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,820
and why did they go away?”

353
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:46,733
You see, his sweetness filled my heart with joy;

354
00:46:52,511 --> 00:46:56,443
I felt what a sweet man he is.

355
00:46:59,603 --> 00:47:04,206
He’s from Scotland, and they say
that Scottish people are very miserly,

356
00:47:04,415 --> 00:47:08,200
but I found Gavin to be a very generous person.

357
00:47:15,493 --> 00:47:19,516
Like that, I like when the
Sahaja Yogis talk good of others,

358
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:23,843
try to help them, and try
to be nice to each other.

359
00:47:24,043 --> 00:47:26,960
That is the most joy-giving thing.

360
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:38,299
All these things will cut out
the domination of matter upon us.

361
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:45,920
We should not care for the matter.

362
00:47:48,291 --> 00:47:53,502
Of course, one should care for
something that is given to you with love.

363
00:47:58,680 --> 00:48:04,160
One day Gregoire had
given Me two little, little horses.

364
00:48:08,532 --> 00:48:11,640
Then I came home, I saw they were missing,

365
00:48:15,277 --> 00:48:19,800
and I went round the whole house seeing them:
“Where are they?” I said, “Where are they gone?”

366
00:48:22,273 --> 00:48:25,462
So I had My servants,
My domestics; they were surprised,

367
00:48:25,662 --> 00:48:30,360
that: “There are so many things in the house,
why is She worried about these two little horses?”

368
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,733
So, My husband came back in the evening.

369
00:48:40,933 --> 00:48:45,160
I said, “Have you seen those two little
horses that Gregoire had given Me?”

370
00:48:51,201 --> 00:48:57,359
“Yes, yes,” he said. “I have kept them properly
in my cupboard because children were there,

371
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,145
they would have broken and
You would have felt bad about them.”

372
00:49:06,523 --> 00:49:11,360
I had so much silver, so many
expensive things—he didn’t bother about that,

373
00:49:15,833 --> 00:49:19,640
because it had an expression of love in that,

374
00:49:23,683 --> 00:49:28,355
which is much more than all the
gold and all the silver put together.

375
00:49:34,235 --> 00:49:39,400
This is what we have to understand,
that love is more important than anything else.

376
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:47,360
You must compete in loving each other more,

377
00:49:51,693 --> 00:49:55,600
compete in being kind to each other,

378
00:49:59,831 --> 00:50:03,472
and compete in being humbler to each other,

379
00:50:07,039 --> 00:50:12,400
compete in doing something for others,

380
00:50:17,381 --> 00:50:21,000
and in saying very sweet things to others.

381
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:30,240
Try to think of doing something very sweet.

382
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:39,573
Like once I went to buy a
sari for Myself and then I found

383
00:50:39,774 --> 00:50:42,086
– you see, for Myself I am quite miserly;

384
00:50:42,287 --> 00:50:46,312
I thought it was rather
expensive and I didn’t buy it.

385
00:50:58,369 --> 00:51:02,051
And another Sahaja Yogi was there,

386
00:51:02,251 --> 00:51:06,458
with Me, I didn’t know, but he bought that sari,

387
00:51:12,127 --> 00:51:15,760
and the next day he brought it to Me as a present.

388
00:51:19,663 --> 00:51:22,360
You don’t know the joy I felt

389
00:51:24,255 --> 00:51:27,720
because I know I’m very miserly about Myself,

390
00:51:33,481 --> 00:51:37,800
and then that sari was so
much appreciated by everyone.

391
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:44,680
Maybe it had that love.

392
00:51:48,234 --> 00:51:53,840
This is what it is: we
have to feel the power of love,

393
00:51:58,688 --> 00:52:02,120
then everything vibrates, the matter vibrates,

394
00:52:05,913 --> 00:52:10,155
and you can feel the vibrations from a distance.

395
00:52:14,579 --> 00:52:18,667
If you come and open My cupboard

396
00:52:18,868 --> 00:52:23,158
and try to arrange My saris,
you will be all filled with vibrations.

397
00:52:35,744 --> 00:52:38,920
Anything that you touch will have vibrations.

398
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:48,720
So, it is important that we should
learn to love and improve our vibrations

399
00:52:54,599 --> 00:52:58,320
so that we can spread love all over

400
00:53:02,152 --> 00:53:08,080
and remove the people from
the shackles of materialism.

401
00:53:14,942 --> 00:53:21,080
I wanted to talk to people in Spain
about this, and for all the other people,

402
00:53:21,551 --> 00:53:26,418
I would say that they should come back

403
00:53:26,863 --> 00:53:29,766
because they have gone too far into it,

404
00:53:40,461 --> 00:53:43,040
because matter complicates you.

405
00:53:45,615 --> 00:53:48,400
It reacts and makes you think more.

406
00:53:51,701 --> 00:53:54,951
It doesn’t allow your
attention to be steady.

407
00:53:57,535 --> 00:54:01,800
If you see anything beautiful,
you just look at it without thinking,

408
00:54:06,891 --> 00:54:13,906
then you will realize
what beauty lies in the matter.

409
00:54:20,287 --> 00:54:23,840
In the Zen system of meditation,

410
00:54:24,164 --> 00:54:30,520
Vidhitama, the one who was
the founder of Zen system, tried it.

411
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,217
I think I’ve talked about it in some other lecture.

412
00:54:47,389 --> 00:54:53,560
With all My love to you, I
would say that try to love each other.

413
00:55:00,266 --> 00:55:05,425
And you have seen that, in India
when you travel, it’s not so comfortable

414
00:55:10,221 --> 00:55:14,512
and we cannot give that
comfort in the small places we go to,

415
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,640
but still, you all enjoy it so much.

416
00:55:26,987 --> 00:55:30,279
You don’t want comfort,
you want the comfort of love.

417
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:37,178
You enjoy each other’s company so much

418
00:55:39,248 --> 00:55:46,160
and that overflowing love of your
host country that is India, Indians.

419
00:55:52,422 --> 00:55:55,800
That is the sign of good Sahaja Yogis.

420
00:56:01,469 --> 00:56:04,360
Because there is a big purpose in our lives

421
00:56:08,590 --> 00:56:11,090
– greatest of all.

422
00:56:13,130 --> 00:56:17,880
What Abraham Lincoln did,
or what Mahatma Gandhi did,

423
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:21,920
your work is much greater and subtler,

424
00:56:31,392 --> 00:56:33,960
because you can do living work.

425
00:56:36,642 --> 00:56:39,600
So, we don’t have to become sanyasis,

426
00:56:41,299 --> 00:56:43,799
we don’t have to give up anything,

427
00:56:45,866 --> 00:56:49,080
but we have to change our attitude.

428
00:56:51,951 --> 00:56:54,951
We have to develop that detachment.

429
00:56:57,415 --> 00:57:00,107
May God bless you all.
