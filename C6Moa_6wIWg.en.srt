1
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:25,620
Today is the first day we are having this puja

2
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:29,040
in this country of Austria.

3
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,700
This country is

4
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:46,290
an historical country with different upheavals

5
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:48,540
it has gone through

6
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,290
to learn so many lessons in life.

7
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:02,910
But human beings are such that

8
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:07,580
they do not relate the calamities with their mistakes.

9
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,910
That's how they go on repeating

10
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:13,370
the same mistakes again and again.

11
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:20,540
The visit to Vienna was overdue

12
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,790
and I came on a day when we had

13
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:29,370
to celebrate the birthday of Machindranath.

14
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:40,370
It's very auspicious for all of you that he should

15
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,950
be today complete his one year of life.

16
00:18:56,250 --> 00:19:00,370
I bless him with all the flowers,

17
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:03,790
the choicest flowers, of beauty

18
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,660
and bliss on him, and his family,

19
00:19:08,290 --> 00:19:10,620
all his relations and his family.

20
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,660
There are so many things which have been done for the first time.

21
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,000
I should say, for the first time I've come to Vienna,

22
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:31,000
to Austria,

23
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:39,740
and the first time I've come to the birthday of a child,

24
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,580
on his first birthday.

25
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,620
And on an Ashtami, that is today,

26
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,120
is the eighth day of the moon,

27
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:57,450
"of the moon which is increasing, Shukla Pakshi"

28
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:04,370
that first time all the weapons of the Goddess

29
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,040
are to be worshipped.

30
00:20:11,370 --> 00:20:15,660
This was a great idea because these weapons

31
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:19,910
who work all the time,

32
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:25,910
not only to kill the evil

33
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:28,250
but to protect the good,

34
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,790
"were never worshipped before

35
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,250
and that today,"

36
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,870
if human beings realise

37
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:40,740
their importance and significance,

38
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:48,580
then lots of problems of atomic bombs

39
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:51,740
and all these things that have been created

40
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,000
could be solved by diverting them

41
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,870
to the right direction,

42
00:20:57,540 --> 00:21:00,830
using them for the destructions

43
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:07,620
"of the evil forces and not the good;"

44
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,200
also for protecting human life,

45
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,410
nourishing human life.

46
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:28,410
The same weapons can be used in a wrong direction,

47
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,870
but, rightly used,

48
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:41,000
they can be dedicated for the use of God's work.

49
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,540
All that is created by human beings,

50
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:53,540
which looks apparently

51
00:21:55,410 --> 00:22:00,950
an instrument of destruction,

52
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:06,290
but if human beings use their wisdom

53
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,200
they will find out

54
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:16,000
that all these inventions that have come to them

55
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:23,120
from the prompting of the Unconscious,

56
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:27,160
are for the work of God.

57
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,290
All scientific research,

58
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,740
everything that has been done,

59
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:36,200
all these instruments that you have produced,

60
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,740
are for the use of God.

61
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,620
In a way we can say

62
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:46,500
that human beings have worked

63
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:53,740
to create methods as instruments,

64
00:22:56,870 --> 00:23:02,660
as social, economic, political institutions

65
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:12,580
to advance the mechanism of God's work.

66
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:17,160
The Unconscious has worked through human beings.

67
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,830
All these institutions,

68
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,410
if they are put to the right side

69
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:32,790
of their activity and not to the hellish activity,

70
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:39,160
they all can join together

71
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:46,200
to complete the work of the Divine.

72
00:23:48,790 --> 00:23:55,580
Like, in the East people believe

73
00:23:56,290 --> 00:24:01,000
that God has created this beautiful body of human beings

74
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,160
and it is for human beings

75
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:13,700
to create beautiful artistic clothes to enhance the beauty

76
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,200
of what God has created,

77
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:19,740
to glorify the beauty of what God has created,

78
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:25,910
to respect the beauty that God has created.

79
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:32,910
And that's what has happened

80
00:24:33,910 --> 00:24:37,290
in many spheres of life, of human activities,

81
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,500
and should have happened in all of them

82
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:43,290
if they had used their wisdom.

83
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,290
The question of knowledge

84
00:24:56,250 --> 00:24:58,410
that I discussed before

85
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,370
is very important to understand.

86
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:06,910
The knowledge that was forbidden

87
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,000
once upon a time, such as Adam and Eve,

88
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:14,120
has been a big problem for human beings to understand.

89
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:19,080
It was the case when

90
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:22,950
God created human beings first time,

91
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:27,950
apart from the celestial beings, who were perfect,

92
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,080
that He wanted to see

93
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,620
if these human beings could grow

94
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:39,950
in their population and in their awareness,

95
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:42,410
in their innocence,

96
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:50,410
they would become Self Realized.

97
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:56,540
But it was an experiment,

98
00:25:57,410 --> 00:26:00,620
and the human beings failed God at that time,

99
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:05,620
because they listened to baser promotions

100
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:06,790
or baser prompting.

101
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:18,410
That's how they failed

102
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,660
and they lost their innocence.

103
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:28,330
And the loss of innocence is the sin

104
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,620
which was first committed,

105
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:36,540
and that sin took a different turn

106
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:40,540
for human beings.

107
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:44,620
Now, that knowledge, what I've said,

108
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,250
is not this real knowledge.

109
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,080
That was the avidya, the artificial knowledge,

110
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:53,870
the knowledge that "I am something,"

111
00:26:54,450 --> 00:27:00,330
that "I am the doer", the ego."

112
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:05,870
Till the animal stage there was no ego,

113
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:09,330
and then the ego started growing.

114
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:12,080
We can say that's the beginning

115
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,740
of the original sin:

116
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,870
that "I am something.

117
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:17,870
I am doing something."

118
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,740
"It's I who can do it". All right?"

119
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,910
So God said,

120
00:27:21,910 --> 00:27:25,410
"Let's see. Let's see their little courage,

121
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,580
and let them decide."

122
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,540
So the plans were changed,

123
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:35,910
one had to think now that we should

124
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,790
get incarnations on this earth

125
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,910
to help these people, to guide them,

126
00:27:41,910 --> 00:27:44,410
to put them into a balance,

127
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,910
to put them into proper understanding of dharma,

128
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,700
so they keep to that balance.

129
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,330
But every time this "I" refused to accept the balance.

130
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,740
And this "I" goes very far from reality.

131
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:14,870
Today also, when we come to Sahaja Yoga,

132
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,330
I see people,

133
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:20,120
they don't grow very fast.

134
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:23,740
Because of this "I" they have questions,

135
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,580
they have doubts, they have problems.

136
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,200
Because of this original sin

137
00:28:32,450 --> 00:28:36,200
people cannot grow very fast.

138
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:40,870
That, "I am the one, I am free.

139
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:44,330
Why that? Why this?"

140
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,450
Who are you to ask questions?

141
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,250
Who has made you?

142
00:28:49,250 --> 00:28:51,620
Have you made yourself?

143
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:54,450
What did you do to become a human being?

144
00:28:54,450 --> 00:28:58,790
Why this kind of egoistical behavior towards God?

145
00:28:59,250 --> 00:29:01,620
"Why God has made us? Why this thing?"

146
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:04,330
Who are you to ask any question?

147
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:08,200
But it is so, the questioning goes on,

148
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:10,200
and such people are very dangerous

149
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,330
for Sahaja Yoga.

150
00:29:13,410 --> 00:29:18,870
If they have to come for puja, I'm worried,

151
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:21,870
not because anything will happen to puja,

152
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:24,830
but because we may lose them completely.

153
00:29:24,830 --> 00:29:28,410
Such egoistical stupid people get lost.

154
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:32,700
As a mother I have simple compassion and love for them,

155
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:38,500
and I feel sad that they could have been saved.

156
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:41,160
But this questioning mind of theirs

157
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,040
can drown them.

158
00:29:43,410 --> 00:29:45,160
This is the basic original sin

159
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,830
that human beings have created.

160
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,950
Apart from that,

161
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:53,160
we had the problem that we have come

162
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,830
from the animal stage to this stage.

163
00:29:56,160 --> 00:30:03,040
So there are animal brutal conditionings within you.

164
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:07,830
Then we have gone through other conditionings,

165
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:13,200
which were created in the history

166
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,700
by the same mister "I"

167
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,200
who has started institutions,

168
00:30:19,330 --> 00:30:21,830
who started organizing religions.

169
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,500
For example, take Christianity.

170
00:30:25,410 --> 00:30:28,080
Christ came here to break your ego.

171
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:32,040
On the contrary, people built a big ego out of it.

172
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:35,000
Now, there are some Sahaja Yogis

173
00:30:35,250 --> 00:30:37,000
who believe that

174
00:30:37,370 --> 00:30:39,660
Sahaja Yoga is a Christian Sahaja Yoga

175
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,620
or a Hindu Sahaja Yoga.

176
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,910
Still that lingers on, that lingers on,

177
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,790
that it is a Christian Sahaja Yoga.

178
00:30:48,790 --> 00:30:51,620
"For Christians it has to be Christian Sahaja Yoga"

179
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:55,120
for Hindus it should be a Hindu Sahaja Yoga.

180
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,660
"For Muslims it is a Muslim Sahaja Yoga;

181
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:00,250
it must relate to Islam,"

182
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,500
because they can't get out of their own conditioning,

183
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,120
so it must relate to that,

184
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:06,330
it must explain everything that is there.

185
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,500
They can't get out, you see?

186
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,000
It could be also a Catholic Sahaja Yoga

187
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,000
or a Protestant Sahaja Yoga.

188
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,620
Could be even deeper than that.

189
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:17,620
Like that, you see, it goes on.

190
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,540
So, you pull Sahaja Yoga

191
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,080
into your own categories,

192
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,660
into your own small little cups.

193
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:26,500
But it's just the other way round.

194
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:30,740
Sahaja Yoga is the ocean, is a universal thing,

195
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,330
it is a MahaYoga.

196
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,910
"It is not meant for Christians, Hindus, Muslims" or anything;

197
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:39,540
it is meant for human beings as they were.

198
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,250
Have you got animals who are Christians,

199
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:45,200
Hindus or Muslims?

200
00:31:45,450 --> 00:31:48,200
This all comes because of the original sin only,

201
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:50,620
that we are something, we are Christians,

202
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,910
we are Hindus, we are Muslims.

203
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:55,660
In Sahaja Yoga, one has to understand

204
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:59,080
that all the rivers, whether it is the River Ganges

205
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,370
or the River Yamuna

206
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,540
or it is the River Thames

207
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,620
or River Danube, any river,

208
00:32:05,870 --> 00:32:09,580
that all of them flow into the same ocean and become the ocean.

209
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,040
They say that when all the rivers

210
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,790
flow in the River Ganges,

211
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:17,870
they are all called as Surasari, means "the River of the Gods."

212
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:20,580
No more people call them by the different names

213
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:24,040
of the tributaries that are there.

214
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,910
In the same way, Sahaja Yoga is the ocean.

215
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,370
You cannot name it.

216
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:33,000
Do not try to find its identity with other things.

217
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,250
If you start doing that, then your mind

218
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:40,250
will start becoming that small little cup.

219
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:44,540
And moreover, if you are coming from some organized religion,

220
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:47,450
it is very important to understand that organized religions

221
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,410
make your cup even stronger, it doesn't dissolve.

222
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,040
If it is a disorganised religion,

223
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:55,200
then it is a cup of earthenware,

224
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,040
which can dissolve into this ocean.

225
00:32:57,290 --> 00:32:59,740
But if it is a solid, nice porcelain,

226
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,450
Meisonn, there is no possibility.

227
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,620
Then you are adhering to all that conditioning,

228
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:11,870
all that solidness, and then it's very difficult.

229
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,450
All the time you have to bring in Christ

230
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:16,700
or you have to bring in Mohammad

231
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:18,580
or you have to bring in Zoroaster,

232
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:22,700
or someone like that who should be there to guide you.

233
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:25,740
Now your guidance is your Spirit,

234
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,330
which is unlimited,

235
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:29,540
so you don't have to bring any one of Them.

236
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:30,950
They are all within you.

237
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,000
They are all part and parcel of you.

238
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:36,120
But to stick on to one person is again

239
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:39,120
a sign that you are not expanding.

240
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,950
You know that you are all.

241
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:44,330
You have got Shri Krishna within you, who is awakened,

242
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,040
you have got Christ within you,

243
00:33:46,410 --> 00:33:48,740
you have got Ganesha within you,

244
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,950
you have got Brahmadeva within you,

245
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,290
and you have got Mohammad within you.

246
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,910
"And you have got all of Them:

247
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,040
Moses, everyone, within you"

248
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:00,080
so how can you be identified with one person?

249
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,950
The reason is, you are still conditioned,

250
00:34:03,290 --> 00:34:06,910
and you want to drag it into your own conditioning.

251
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:14,500
So try to bring it at a position where there is no conditioning.

252
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:17,330
We can see our conditioning worse works so much

253
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,540
with our style because,

254
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:30,790
as human beings, we have a habit of forming a closed sect,

255
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,370
"whether it is ourselves,

256
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:36,660
first we close ourselves as "I." "I am XYZ."

257
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,790
Then we can club together as,

258
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,790
say, "We are, say, people who use forks and knives".

259
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:48,330
There could be people who just use

260
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,700
the fork and knives this way can be clubbed together,

261
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:53,870
and the others who use this way can be another way.

262
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,580
See, it goes on like that,

263
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:57,410
all kinds of stupidity

264
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,330
that human beings have to club together.

265
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,910
All right, use the way you like, it makes no difference.

266
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:05,700
You eat the same food, it digests the same way, and it works the same.

267
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:08,080
But as far as the outside is concerned,

268
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:09,950
when it comes to human activity,

269
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:12,000
they will use the fork and spoon in a different way,

270
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,200
somebody will use their hands, fingers,

271
00:35:14,450 --> 00:35:17,410
and somebody will, I don't know, may use daggers.

272
00:35:17,410 --> 00:35:20,540
I don't know how they can manage to go to what limit.

273
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:22,200
So, this is what it is.

274
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,250
In doing something, in doing any activity,

275
00:35:27,580 --> 00:35:31,620
then only human beings make it a closed circuit,

276
00:35:31,910 --> 00:35:34,450
that "This is how we do it. This is how they do it,"

277
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:41,080
how it is, the method of another party or people.

278
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,740
This groupism is the worst of all

279
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,580
and is against the laws of nature.

280
00:35:47,580 --> 00:35:52,700
You can be individual, as far as your appearance is concerned,

281
00:35:52,950 --> 00:36:00,580
as far as your hair colour is concerned,

282
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:02,620
or your eye colour is concerned

283
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:04,950
that's that God has created you that way.

284
00:36:04,950 --> 00:36:09,580
But all other things that you have created are dead.

285
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:13,580
All other clubbing methods you have created

286
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:17,250
are absolute of no value.

287
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:18,950
They are just mythical.

288
00:36:19,290 --> 00:36:21,290
There's nothing truth in it,

289
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:23,790
nothing that should be worth of considering.

290
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:25,830
It is just a myth!

291
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:30,080
So one has to understand that there is nothing

292
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:33,160
like a Sahaja Yoga which is a Christian Sahaja Yoga,

293
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,160
Sahaja Yoga which is a Protestant Sahaja Yoga

294
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,080
or a Catholic Sahaja Yoga.

295
00:36:38,370 --> 00:36:41,790
I find this at a very subtle point,

296
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:44,290
where people talk of collectivity,

297
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,450
that they don't understand that we are not collective,

298
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,250
because we have so many tags,

299
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:52,120
you see, attached to us,

300
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:58,580
like the conditionings of our own doings.

301
00:36:58,790 --> 00:37:00,580
It could be in Switzerland,

302
00:37:00,830 --> 00:37:02,250
it could be in Austria,

303
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:06,290
it could be in Rome, or it could be in India, anywhere.

304
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:08,580
These conditionings, we have to get rid of these.

305
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:11,450
We should know we are human beings, created by God,

306
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:17,290
and whatever is within us that is real, created by Him,

307
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:21,740
is the only thing that we have to be

308
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,700
and all the rest of the conditionings

309
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,580
we should try to get rid.

310
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,540
Everything is complementary.

311
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:30,870
From this place you have to learn something,

312
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,950
from that place you have to learn something.

313
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:36,830
Every place has something to learn

314
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,000
and to understand.

315
00:37:39,450 --> 00:37:43,660
And there is nothing that can be retained

316
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:47,500
by some people as something higher or lower.

317
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,080
But of course, where this ego has developed more,

318
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,000
this original sin has developed more,

319
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:56,330
there is a possibility

320
00:37:56,330 --> 00:38:02,660
that such human beings must have created more conditioning.

321
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,290
Naturally the conditioning is much more.

322
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:09,700
Or where they have been not at all moving

323
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:11,740
about religion,

324
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,830
about God, and have been sticking on,

325
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,580
like, you can say, in Africa and all these places,

326
00:38:17,910 --> 00:38:20,830
could be that the conditioning

327
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:24,290
could have been by the other forces,

328
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,580
called as Adibhautik,

329
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:31,160
means the ones which are created

330
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:34,160
out of what God has created.

331
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,040
Like, if they see the moon,

332
00:38:36,290 --> 00:38:38,040
they are afraid of the moon,

333
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,370
if they see the trees,

334
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:41,370
they are afraid of the trees.

335
00:38:41,660 --> 00:38:46,290
Sort of a mythical ideas about the nature itself.

336
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:49,160
See, so there are two styles,

337
00:38:49,450 --> 00:38:50,700
as you always know.

338
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:55,410
One is where they create mythical ideas

339
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,040
about the nature,

340
00:38:57,290 --> 00:38:59,410
the mythical side of nature,

341
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:01,660
that is Adibhautik

342
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,500
and Adidaivik are the mythical ideas

343
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,580
about what you can produce,

344
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:12,660
you are God, you are the devas,

345
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,290
and you want to create this.

346
00:39:14,290 --> 00:39:15,910
"I'm this, I'm that."

347
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,660
So there are two types of conditionings which work out,

348
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,000
and in modern times it is such a confused thing

349
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:25,080
that both these sides,

350
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,120
I don't know where they act.

351
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,660
For example, the other day I was coming

352
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:35,950
near the cemetery in Vienna,

353
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:38,580
and I was amazed that it was a cemetery

354
00:39:38,830 --> 00:39:41,740
but it was catching on right Swadisthana.

355
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:44,410
So I said, "All the bhoots must be acting now,

356
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:46,870
because I can't understand how can

357
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:51,160
a cemetery have a right Swadisthana?"

358
00:39:51,950 --> 00:39:53,700
This is how it can be explained,

359
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:55,870
that all the bhoots are now active,

360
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,200
or maybe they are again born, you see.

361
00:39:58,450 --> 00:40:00,290
They must have been dead hundreds of times,

362
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:02,160
they must have created graves after graves

363
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,330
and only there are empty graves, and they are active now.

364
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:07,620
Or maybe that the bhoots themselves are active,

365
00:40:07,620 --> 00:40:08,660
they are no more there,

366
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:11,330
they have all disappeared from there. It could be that.

367
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:13,870
So we have to judge now on vibrations

368
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,580
and not on our understanding

369
00:40:15,870 --> 00:40:19,620
or what we think or what we understand

370
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:20,870
through this brain.

371
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:25,000
By asking questions and by talking too much about it,

372
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,870
you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

373
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,580
For Sahaja Yoga you have to have

374
00:40:28,790 --> 00:40:30,370
that super state of mind,

375
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:32,370
where you can receive vibrations,

376
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:35,000
can feel vibrations and have to be

377
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:37,870
absolutely compromised on them.

378
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:42,950
If there is still the tag of that ego so much

379
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,910
that you still question Sahaja Yoga

380
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:47,040
and think no end of yourself,

381
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:48,620
it is better that such a person

382
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:50,540
should not attend the pujas,

383
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:53,370
not attend the pujas. It is kind to himself.

384
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,410
It is being nice to himself that

385
00:40:55,410 --> 00:40:58,410
such a person who has doubts should not attend a puja,

386
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,500
because puja is only meant for people

387
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:03,200
who have achieved and received that state of mind

388
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,410
which is called as Nirvikalpa,

389
00:41:05,410 --> 00:41:08,250
where there is no vikalpa, where there is no doubt in your mind.

390
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,120
If there are still doubts in your mind,

391
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,160
your mind is still very powerful,

392
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,120
and it is going to put you down.

393
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:18,330
So either before the puja you tell your mind to keep quiet.

394
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,620
"Tell him not to talk now,

395
00:41:20,910 --> 00:41:24,200
Better keep quiet, now I have to ascend"

396
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,290
and I have to receive the blessings of the Divine.

397
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,620
"So just keep quiet, and if you cannot keep quiet

398
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,870
then I cannot ascend."

399
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,950
I have told you many a times it is like a donkey, 

400
00:41:37,330 --> 00:41:39,700
the mind is just like a donkey.

401
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,950
If you go behind the donkey, it kicks you,

402
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,580
it will tell you,

403
00:41:44,830 --> 00:41:47,580
"that you are the bad man, you are the worst man"

404
00:41:47,830 --> 00:41:49,580
all the self-pity will come into you.

405
00:41:49,830 --> 00:41:52,370
If you go ahead with the donkey,

406
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:56,080
then he'll put his ears to you, you can hold him like an ego, you see.

407
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:59,040
You can go wherever you want, and do what you like, "What's wrong?"

408
00:41:59,370 --> 00:42:00,910
It will not control you.

409
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,000
If you sit on top of the donkey

410
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:07,000
it will still play about with you, to see how you work out.

411
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:11,830
So if you allow the mind to go here and there,

412
00:42:12,290 --> 00:42:15,290
through your eyes or through your attention, or anywhere,

413
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:18,700
or through your tongue or your senses, it will say, "All right."

414
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:20,950
It will eat the grass on the sides, it won't move.

415
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:23,370
It will move to this side, eat some grass, that side.

416
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:25,290
Gregoire: At this stage, as You speak about it,

417
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:27,330
should I quickly translate for the French

418
00:42:27,330 --> 00:42:28,660
who don't understand English?

419
00:42:28,660 --> 00:42:30,120
Oh, you want to translate the whole thing?

420
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,620
Gregoire: I can in two minutes.

421
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:33,830
I think later on, Gregoire, would be better,

422
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:38,290
if you could translate, because the flow is better now all right?

423
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:46,740
So this donkey, the donkey wants to eat the grass.

424
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,410
He knows that you don't mind him eating the grass.

425
00:42:49,410 --> 00:42:51,200
All right, it goes round, eats grass,

426
00:42:51,450 --> 00:42:53,540
all sorts of dirt, filth, whatever it is.

427
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:56,330
Whatever you allow he eats, goes on eating,

428
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,200
all filthy things, all filthy thoughts,

429
00:42:58,450 --> 00:43:00,370
all dirty thoughts and every sort of thing,

430
00:43:00,370 --> 00:43:02,000
without questioning, you see?

431
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,120
Only in Sahaja Yoga they come here and question,

432
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:06,870
but not when they have to eat filth and dirt and all kinds

433
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:11,540
of unholy things and sinful things, they never question.

434
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,740
Then they'll say, "What's wrong?"

435
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:16,660
But when it comes to Sahaja Yoga they will question it.

436
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,950
Which is the holiest of holy?

437
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:21,660
Which is the greatest of greatest?

438
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:23,660
Only these gates are open to you.

439
00:43:23,660 --> 00:43:26,740
That's how you get it otherwise it is not,

440
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:30,250
it's prohibited to all the people to achieve this.

441
00:43:33,370 --> 00:43:39,540
The water that washes My feet is the ambrosia,

442
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,740
is the tirtha,

443
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,580
which was even prohibited to doctors in the olden days.

444
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:49,790
Vaidyas were not allowed, and they had to fight for.

445
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,120
Only the Gods were allowed to drink it.

446
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:54,790
Only the Gods were allowed to drink it.

447
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,200
Today you are placed at the position of Gods.

448
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,660
But are you capable of that?

449
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,620
Are you deserving that?

450
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,330
Or you are still questioning,

451
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,740
you have still problems?

452
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:09,660
Then it is better you are prohibited.

453
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:14,200
It's a rare thing that you should take that ambrosia.

454
00:44:15,290 --> 00:44:17,040
It's in the Devi Purana Bhagavatam,

455
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,160
if you read, that they were prohibited to take it.

456
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,540
So this is what it is,

457
00:44:21,790 --> 00:44:24,660
that the mind goes like a donkey.

458
00:44:24,910 --> 00:44:30,080
But if the donkey knows the one who is the rider,

459
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,830
knows his ways,

460
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,790
and he knows how to control the mind

461
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:38,450
and he knows where it has to work,

462
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:41,540
the same donkey, the same instruments,

463
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,740
the same institutions,

464
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,620
the same things you have got around you,

465
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,660
will take you there with a faster speed,

466
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,000
with a very comfortable thing.

467
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:55,740
So tell your mind today,

468
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:58,740
that we have had enough of it,

469
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:00,080
playing with the mind.

470
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:05,540
Now we want to be there in the realm of God.

471
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,950
Tell your mind, fully, tell your mind.

472
00:45:40,950 --> 00:45:42,080
It is important.

473
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:44,620
This is the mind which has taken you to all kinds of things

474
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,540
it has given you all the filth and dirt and all that.

475
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:50,160
So just tell your mind.

476
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,740
May God bless you!

477
00:46:12,700 --> 00:46:14,500
So for today's theme,

478
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:17,080
we should say that we have to achieve

479
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:20,290
our innocence within ourselves,

480
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:23,740
and feel the innocence of the Virata.

481
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:27,700
The question of Ganesha Virata,

482
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:29,580
we can say, or Virata Ganesha,

483
00:46:29,830 --> 00:46:33,700
where, in the Virata, the innocence we have to feel,

484
00:46:33,950 --> 00:46:38,620
so that we become innocent, our sins are washed out,

485
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:44,700
that we are cleansed by that innocence,

486
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:49,080
"so that this "I-ness" is lost from you,"

487
00:46:49,330 --> 00:46:53,620
this original sin is washed away from us,

488
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:58,330
and we become that beautiful being

489
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,080
who is the proud child of God,

490
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:11,740
and who is the prize of this creation.

491
00:47:15,830 --> 00:47:16,740
May God bless you!

492
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:18,330
Now you can translate, Gregoire.

493
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,160
It's all right. You can translate.

494
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:22,080
I know it is long, but sometimes

495
00:47:22,330 --> 00:47:24,080
I find that if the flow is not kept...

496
00:47:24,080 --> 00:47:26,700
Gregoire: I'm sorry, Mother, I should not have interrupted.

497
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,700
No, it's all right, it's all right.

498
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:38,410
You can replay, and in that background

499
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:40,620
you will be able to, keep it low,

500
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,830
so that you can spontaneously

501
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:44,910
go on saying something.

502
00:47:44,910 --> 00:47:48,410
Will it be all right? To replay?

503
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,500
That will give you a proper...

504
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:56,450
Gregoire: I was just thinking three minutes for the French,

505
00:47:56,450 --> 00:47:57,740
and three minutes for the Italian,

506
00:47:58,000 --> 00:47:59,040
in a very condensed manner.

507
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:00,000
You can?

508
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,000
Gregoire: I can, yes.

509
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:02,370
All right.

510
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,160
Many people ask Me, before also, that,

511
00:53:54,410 --> 00:53:56,740
"Mother, why we became like this?"

512
00:53:57,080 --> 00:54:00,700
Why didn't God just made us aware of ourselves,

513
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,200
without committing all these mistakes?

514
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:08,580
"And why we had to go through this all vicious circle?"

515
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:11,830
At that time, I didn't want to say that

516
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:14,200
you have committed the original sin,

517
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,950
that you have disobeyed God.

518
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,500
Otherwise things would have worked out in a different way,

519
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,950
not have been so lengthy.

520
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,830
Because if you tell them that, then there is another thing

521
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:26,080
that happens to them is that they become left-sided

522
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:27,870
that they start feeling guilty about the original sin, you see.

523
00:54:29,290 --> 00:54:32,540
So we have to jump from ego to the original sin part of it.

524
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:37,540
But that part of you avoid it, only one can say, in the beginning,

525
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:41,200
that evolution could not take place

526
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:43,740
without this freedom being given to you, you see,

527
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:45,740
because freedom was first tested,

528
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:47,290
that you were given a freedom.

529
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,950
You had a nice place to live in,

530
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:53,290
you lived in the complete protection of God,

531
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,700
in the garden of Eden, you can say,

532
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:58,000
in the beautiful... everything was wonderful.

533
00:54:58,290 --> 00:54:59,870
Nothing was missing there.

534
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:02,080
But, despite that, human beings, you see,

535
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,450
when they had the freedom,

536
00:55:03,450 --> 00:55:06,830
just the freedom was going to be tested,

537
00:55:07,080 --> 00:55:10,620
immediately they took to these baser things, you see.

538
00:55:10,870 --> 00:55:13,450
And that is the way God had

539
00:55:13,450 --> 00:55:15,450
to then change the whole plans,

540
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:19,830
because the baser things of life were attractive,

541
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,540
even with all the blessings that they had.

542
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:27,080
All the animosity and the, we can say,

543
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:29,450
all the animal feelings, we can say,

544
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,830
were still attractive to human beings,

545
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:35,450
and that's what was most surprising.

546
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:37,450
And when these things happened,

547
00:55:37,700 --> 00:55:39,540
naturally the freedom itself

548
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:42,290
had to go through the test of improvement.

549
00:55:42,580 --> 00:55:48,330
And that test was all this whole creation of human beings

550
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:49,580
that took place.

551
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,500
But to tell them all that

552
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:54,160
"That it is only the original sin which has created a problem."

553
00:55:54,450 --> 00:55:55,250
Then they feel then,

554
00:55:55,250 --> 00:55:57,910
"Oh, God, why did You create the original sin?"

555
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:00,580
So it is better to tell them that it is inevitable,

556
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,700
for your evolutionary process,

557
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,700
that your freedom must be tested,

558
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:08,290
because if you have to enter

559
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,500
into the supreme freedom,

560
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:11,830
you must first know

561
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:13,580
whether you can bear it or not.

562
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:15,290
And in seeing that ...

563
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,660
So, it took so many years

564
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:22,830
for human beings to grow into it, to understand that

565
00:56:23,120 --> 00:56:25,290
the man cannot bear anything. He cannot bear freedom,

566
00:56:25,580 --> 00:56:27,790
he cannot bear money, he cannot bear position,

567
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:30,450
he cannot bear comfort, he cannot bear anything.

568
00:56:30,790 --> 00:56:32,830
And that's what now we are seeing in Sahaja Yoga also:

569
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,580
when they get comfort, they they are just sitting down again.

570
00:56:36,580 --> 00:56:39,120
When they get any blessings of material wealth,

571
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:42,160
it will happen which it was, again the same,

572
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:45,040
that Garden of Eden is coming back to you,

573
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:46,910
and when it starts coming back to you,

574
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:49,910
again you go back to the same stage. It's not good.

575
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:53,790
Now you must understand that you have to be supreme,

576
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,450
so you must master all this.

577
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,120
Nothing is important, nothing is important,

578
00:56:57,450 --> 00:56:58,910
only the Spirit is important.

579
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,450
Then only you can get out of ...

580
00:57:00,450 --> 00:57:03,660
This is also can act as a temptation for you, you see.

581
00:57:04,250 --> 00:57:07,330
All the blessings that are coming to you are temptations.

582
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,540
So you should be prepared.

583
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:12,580
Nothing is more important than the Spirit, you see.

584
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:16,330
We are prepared for any kind of thing to achieve the Spirit.

585
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:19,660
We are not bothered as to what blessings we get or anything.

586
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:22,200
But what we want is the freedom of Spirit

587
00:57:22,450 --> 00:57:24,450
which is not hankering after anything,

588
00:57:24,870 --> 00:57:26,830
hankering after material things,

589
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,950
so that you will be like a lamp

590
00:57:30,410 --> 00:57:32,250
which is giving light,

591
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:34,580
without getting involved into the lamp itself.

592
00:57:34,830 --> 00:57:37,120
Whether it is of gold or silver or anything,

593
00:57:38,330 --> 00:57:42,330
it can burn, the light, even if it is made of mud.

594
00:57:42,330 --> 00:57:44,660
That's what is to be achieved by Sahaja Yogis,

595
00:57:44,910 --> 00:57:48,290
to be understood because this is a very precarious stage where,

596
00:57:48,580 --> 00:57:51,250
I find, people are again drifting down.

597
01:02:02,620 --> 01:02:05,410
So now we have to humble down ourselves,

598
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:09,330
to say, "I have not known anything, Mother, so far, I have to know."

599
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,740
Because, this is the knowledge of the root,

600
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,080
which you do not know.

601
01:02:13,410 --> 01:02:14,540
This is a new knowledge for you. What can you question about it?

602
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:16,950
You don't know anything.

603
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,580
You have to know about the knowledge of the root.

604
01:02:19,830 --> 01:02:21,080
So humble down yourself,

605
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:25,040
and then only, you will receive the blessings of this new growth.

606
01:02:25,370 --> 01:02:30,790
That is the growth that is inward, inside, the Antar Yoga.

607
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:34,040
Unless and until you humble down, it won't work out.

608
01:02:34,290 --> 01:02:35,290
You have to humble down,

609
01:02:35,540 --> 01:02:38,290
because as soon as you start asking questions,

610
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:40,290
it's your ego that is asking questions.

611
01:02:40,540 --> 01:02:42,830
So humble down and to grow into it,

612
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:48,410
and to go further with the knowledge of the roots.

613
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:54,910
It is surprising that in India only this knowledge

614
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:57,040
has been really sought after,

615
01:02:57,290 --> 01:02:59,200
and people have gone very deep down.

616
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:02,250
That's why every one of them had to come to India.

617
01:03:02,500 --> 01:03:04,910
Even Christ came to India to know about

618
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:10,160
how people are searching it out, to support them, to help them.

619
01:03:10,410 --> 01:03:16,040
So it is important that the knowledge of the root has to be done

620
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:20,080
in the area where it is more possible.

621
01:03:20,580 --> 01:03:23,250
"It is easier to do where the roots are not disturbed"

622
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,700
and that's what was the country, India,

623
01:03:25,950 --> 01:03:27,500
where people searched it out.

624
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,500
"But when they started growing out again,

625
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:31,200
they became stupid and foolish"

626
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,830
and when we see them, we see them, they're outside.

627
01:03:34,250 --> 01:03:37,910
But we don't see what a tremendous work

628
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:41,040
the seers have put in India, tremendous.

629
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,910
I mean, you take one of them and it is sufficient

630
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:45,620
to give you a full idea of Sahaja Yoga.

631
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:50,160
You take a simple person, a very simple person like,

632
01:03:50,540 --> 01:03:55,910
say, Sai Nath, who was, to look at, very simple,

633
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,500
but what tremendous ocean of knowledge he had.

634
01:03:58,910 --> 01:04:00,950
Who was not educated or anything.

635
01:04:01,250 --> 01:04:03,370
Nobody knows where He was born, what happened,

636
01:04:03,370 --> 01:04:06,040
from where He came and where He lived,

637
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:08,160
and how He came up to that age.

638
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:11,950
No one knows about His background.

639
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:15,160
Or you take Adi Sankaracharya,

640
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:18,910
or you can take Kabira, or anyone.

641
01:04:19,250 --> 01:04:21,290
For example, you take Machindranath.

642
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:24,910
If you read about Machindranath, you won't know,

643
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:29,540
you'll think it's some sort of a mysterious knowledge he's giving.

644
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:32,080
It's a tremendous work they did!

645
01:04:32,370 --> 01:04:35,500
They went into all the left and the right, and everything they did,

646
01:04:36,700 --> 01:04:38,540
all kinds of experimentations.

647
01:04:38,790 --> 01:04:41,540
If you see the books they have written about the Nav Naths,

648
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:44,040
the Nine Nathas, and about Machindra's life.

649
01:04:44,370 --> 01:04:49,040
Machindranath went into such depth, and he found out so much

650
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,700
about the places where women were rulers.

651
01:04:51,950 --> 01:04:55,540
I think it must be the Belgian place he must have been,

652
01:04:56,370 --> 01:04:57,620
"where women were the rulers and

653
01:04:57,910 --> 01:04:59,500
husbands were just like cabbages"

654
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,740
and this and that and all kinds of things He discovered and then,

655
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,290
what happened and how he tried to cure that.

656
01:05:05,700 --> 01:05:07,700
It's the movement in another direction, you see,

657
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:09,540
in the root direction, that how

658
01:05:09,740 --> 01:05:12,290
these roots have gone and given rise

659
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:16,620
to such horrible trees here and there and that's how he worked out.

660
01:05:16,620 --> 01:05:21,740
And it's such a symbolic thing that you to understand their work,

661
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,330
you have to be really very deep

662
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:28,740
and very penetrating for which

663
01:05:29,580 --> 01:05:33,700
the human mind so far is not able to see

664
01:05:33,950 --> 01:05:35,540
the amount of work they have done.

665
01:05:35,740 --> 01:05:37,290
It's not possible to see.

666
01:05:37,580 --> 01:05:40,740
Like, if you see Adi Shankaracharya's descriptions

667
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:43,410
or that even Markandeya's description about your Mother,

668
01:05:44,370 --> 01:05:48,500
it's remarkable how little-little things He could see.

669
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:50,200
From where, from what angles.

670
01:05:50,580 --> 01:05:55,580
And every little bit of Mother he could see,

671
01:05:55,580 --> 01:05:57,330
as a child would see,

672
01:05:57,580 --> 01:05:59,740
you see, absolutely close to the Mother.

673
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:03,870
That means the innocence was complete and perfected.

674
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:06,620
Otherwise you can't see these points that they have seen,

675
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:09,370
all the little things like the three folds of the Mother.

676
01:06:09,660 --> 01:06:10,790
How can anyone see,

677
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,250
but a child can see that three folds of the mothers are there,

678
01:06:14,580 --> 01:06:16,580
that she has three folds in her body.

679
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:18,660
Only a child can see.

680
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,740
It's tremendous, I tell you,

681
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:22,870
it's tremendous that innocence

682
01:06:22,870 --> 01:06:26,120
their penetration and their courage.

683
01:06:26,370 --> 01:06:29,580
Need real courage to grow into that penetration.

684
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:34,000
So innocence is the thing which one has to achieve first of all,

685
01:06:34,450 --> 01:06:38,040
but it should not be like this through Christ or through Ganesha,

686
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:40,450
it should be you who should have it.

687
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:43,660
Means you are, you are the innocence.

688
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:45,500
You don't have to say that,

689
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:47,790
you don't have to come through someone.

690
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:53,370
You are that, you just directly can have.

691
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:57,450
That business is meant for people who are not realized,

692
01:06:57,660 --> 01:06:59,330
meant for people who are stupid,

693
01:06:59,620 --> 01:07:02,250
meant for people who can not directly attain.

694
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,200
You all can directly attain it.

695
01:07:04,200 --> 01:07:06,330
That is your blessing, that's the greatest thing

696
01:07:06,580 --> 01:07:08,870
that you can directly achieve all that.

697
01:07:09,200 --> 01:07:12,250
But you have to get to that position of innocence

698
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:15,370
by which you become so subtle, so sukshma,

699
01:07:15,620 --> 01:07:18,660
because innocence is the subtlest thing that you enter into

700
01:07:18,660 --> 01:07:23,250
all the areas to know the knowledge of the roots,

701
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,870
knowledge of the Tree of Life.

702
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:31,120
And it's not meant for the stupid egoistical nonsensical people.

703
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:33,500
They become rakshasas I tell you, they are rakshasas.

704
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:35,660
So we are not going to go their way,

705
01:07:36,040 --> 01:07:37,580
we have to go the other way round.

706
01:07:37,580 --> 01:07:40,000
So we have to humble down within ourselves

707
01:07:40,370 --> 01:07:42,870
and try to awaken your innocence,

708
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:46,120
once that is the holy innocence,

709
01:07:46,500 --> 01:07:48,160
that pavitra innocence within you.

710
01:07:56,000 --> 01:08:01,200
In Sanskrit language there's no word for innocence, to the surprise.

711
01:08:01,910 --> 01:08:05,370
Because for them whatever is the holy, auspicious, everything,

712
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,790
there's no word, separated from innocence,

713
01:08:08,790 --> 01:08:13,580
because they can't think that there can be innocence

714
01:08:13,790 --> 01:08:15,500
existing in the air like that.

715
01:08:15,740 --> 01:08:18,620
It has to be inside something, you see,

716
01:08:18,870 --> 01:08:23,620
it is always sort of a cup that can only contain the water like that.

717
01:08:23,870 --> 01:08:25,000
So they can not think,

718
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:28,740
can not think of water hanging in the air like that, you see.

719
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,580
It has to have some cup.

720
01:08:30,910 --> 01:08:32,620
"So they will say "auspicious time,"

721
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:36,120
"auspicious person" or

722
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:40,330
"auspicious thing", "auspicious night",

723
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:41,870
"auspicious day."

724
01:08:42,120 --> 01:08:47,040
Everything is contained,

725
01:08:47,330 --> 01:08:49,040
container, like a container.

726
01:08:49,450 --> 01:08:52,000
The container that can have innocence, you see.

727
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:56,250
So the auspiciosness. Again, auspicious. It's an adjective.

728
01:08:57,870 --> 01:09:03,250
There is nothing like saying that this is

729
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,450
a solid innocence, the shubbha.

730
01:09:05,660 --> 01:09:07,660
Shubbha itself is an adjective,

731
01:09:07,910 --> 01:09:10,910
there's no noun for innocence.

732
01:09:10,910 --> 01:09:13,910
Innocent it can be, but innocence itself

733
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:16,500
doesn't exist for them

734
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:19,660
Because it exists everywhere that is innocent.

735
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,200
It's such a wider idea,

736
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:26,370
it's a wider idea of the Virat Ganesha.

737
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:30,580
When He is in the whole of Virata,

738
01:09:31,040 --> 01:09:33,910
how can you put Him down as вЂ˜innocence'?

739
01:09:35,870 --> 01:09:38,330
Is so much subtle,

740
01:09:38,580 --> 01:09:42,450
too subtle to be made into a noun.

741
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:45,740
too subtle a thing,

742
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,450
and we have to become that subtle.

743
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:53,000
May God bless you all!

744
01:10:22,370 --> 01:10:25,250
You can start washing My Feet.

745
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:28,950
First, what we can do, is

746
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:32,120
that those who have not washed My Feet

747
01:10:32,370 --> 01:10:44,290
please raise your hands so far. He has not washed?

748
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:49,250
All right, come.

749
01:32:05,000 --> 01:32:07,250
These are the twenty-one names,

750
01:32:07,870 --> 01:32:09,830
these are the Twenty-One Names

751
01:32:10,160 --> 01:32:16,000
of Shri Vishnu which is the aspect of your evolution,

752
01:32:16,580 --> 01:32:17,910
of your dharma.

753
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:21,120
First the sustenance and then evolution.

754
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:26,500
That's the Father within you.

755
01:32:26,910 --> 01:32:32,120
And so first because you are all seeking your evolution

756
01:32:33,290 --> 01:32:37,500
we invoke the twenty-one powers,

757
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:44,790
twenty-one powers of this Father aspect of God.

758
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:46,580
Twenty-one powers.

759
01:32:47,700 --> 01:32:52,160
These are the twenty-one names which represent

760
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:55,870
the twenty-one powers of evolution within us.

761
01:32:58,370 --> 01:33:01,120
Sushumna Channel has got

762
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:03,790
twenty-one powers.

763
01:33:07,120 --> 01:33:10,580
You can translate, in French it's better.

764
01:33:14,160 --> 01:33:17,410
Vishnu, Vishnu, it's the Vishnu power or,

765
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:19,580
we can say, the Narayana.

766
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:21,450
Vishnu is the Father.

767
01:38:49,830 --> 01:38:51,740
Krita Yuga. This is the Krita Yuga.

768
01:38:51,740 --> 01:38:55,000
Krita means when where it will be effective,

769
01:38:56,450 --> 01:38:58,290
when where it is going to be effective.

770
01:38:58,540 --> 01:39:00,450
The work will be done. This is the Yuga,

771
01:39:00,450 --> 01:39:02,000
the times where it will be done.

772
01:39:02,290 --> 01:39:03,580
Krita Yuga.

773
01:39:03,830 --> 01:39:06,200
This is the special time which is in between

774
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:07,620
Kali Yuga and Satya Yuga,

775
01:39:07,870 --> 01:39:10,580
is the Krita Yuga where things will be done,

776
01:39:10,830 --> 01:39:12,540
work will be done.

777
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:13,830
Resurrection time

778
01:39:13,830 --> 01:39:15,080
where your hands will speak.

779
01:39:15,330 --> 01:39:18,950
This is the thing. You see. Translate it.

780
01:39:19,950 --> 01:39:22,740
"Krita Yuga. "Kri" means "to do."

781
01:51:35,040 --> 01:51:38,410
See, svatojayte, means the principle,

782
01:51:38,660 --> 01:51:42,410
you awaken the principle of the whole universe,

783
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:46,500
the principle of the universe and Pratye

784
01:51:46,700 --> 01:51:51,950
means you give also the experience of that,

785
01:51:52,500 --> 01:51:56,370
so that he is the one who generates the principle

786
01:51:56,790 --> 01:51:59,370
and also he gives you the experience.

787
01:52:11,790 --> 01:52:15,120
pratye, pratye is the experience that proves,

788
01:52:18,200 --> 01:52:21,370
that proves your existence, you see.

789
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:24,910
You give your own pratye, means you give your experience

790
01:52:25,330 --> 01:52:27,790
by which it proves that you exist.

791
02:02:54,790 --> 02:02:57,620
It should be "You are God in man", it would be better.

792
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,200
God in man.

793
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:06,200
He is not man, by any chance,

794
02:03:06,870 --> 02:03:08,870
how can you call Him?
