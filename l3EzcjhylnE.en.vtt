00:04:34.298 --> 00:04:47.147
Today we have decided to celebrate the Buddha
Jayanti, it's the day of Buddha's birth.

00:04:50.035 --> 00:05:06.755
In the whole
map of time, Buddha came to this earth at

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:13.015
a time when it was so important for Him to
come.

00:05:13.015 --> 00:05:34.935
That time, especially in India, we had two
types of people: one, who were very ritualistic,

00:05:34.935 --> 00:05:55.955
trying to be extremely strict and disciplined;
and the another were the people who were

00:05:55.955 --> 00:06:07.514
too much conditioned and were full of so-called
devotion to God.

00:06:07.514 --> 00:06:24.305
So these two types of people were occupying
the area of seekers.

00:06:24.305 --> 00:06:35.574
So it was necessary to neutralize these two
styles of seekings.

00:06:35.574 --> 00:06:52.945
Buddha and Mahavira are, in essence, supported
by Hanumana and Bhairava - that is, as you

00:06:52.945 --> 00:06:57.485
know, Gabriel and Saint Michael.

00:06:57.485 --> 00:07:10.585
The principle that took birth is the principle
of a disciple, and this principle was born

00:07:10.585 --> 00:07:18.165
much earlier as the two sons of Shri Rama.

00:07:18.165 --> 00:07:31.085
This principle was brought on this earth and
incarnated: one, to conquer the ego of human

00:07:31.085 --> 00:07:39.574
beings; another one, to conquer the superego
of human beings.

00:07:39.574 --> 00:07:49.634
Buddha, when He was born, He found that there
was misery everywhere.

00:07:49.634 --> 00:07:58.665
And the misery, according to Him, was due
to the desires we have.

00:07:58.665 --> 00:08:05.685
So to be desireless is the best way to achieve
Nirvana.

00:08:05.685 --> 00:08:10.355
That's what He came to conclusion.

00:08:10.355 --> 00:08:12.505
But how to become desireless?

00:08:12.505 --> 00:08:22.685
You are sitting in the sand, and if you see,
the sand doesn't get attached to anything.

00:08:22.685 --> 00:08:26.665
You put anything on it, it will not spoil
anything.

00:08:26.665 --> 00:08:35.285
You put water, it will stick on, and as soon
as you try to throw it away the whole thing

00:08:35.285 --> 00:08:39.795
will disappear into thin air.

00:08:39.795 --> 00:08:59.545
So to develop that kind of detachment, or
to develop a life which was desireless was

00:08:59.746 --> 00:09:01.174
His aim.

00:09:01.382 --> 00:09:05.635
And that's why I say He was a Disciple Principles.

00:09:05.635 --> 00:09:17.975
So, the Disciple Principle has to find out
the way and method, while the Guru Principle

00:09:17.975 --> 00:09:22.424
are the people who have already found out.

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:25.635
Because He has to create a way and path.

00:09:25.635 --> 00:09:32.365
So, He studied all kinds of books, went to
many places.

00:09:32.365 --> 00:09:34.555
He read Upanishadas.

00:09:34.555 --> 00:09:41.584
Then He saw the people who are busy with Vedas
and were doing all kinds of ritualism.

00:09:41.584 --> 00:09:54.225
With the rituals, they never got the Realization,
which is actually the first verse of Veda

00:09:54.225 --> 00:10:02.264
is that, "By reading the Vedas and by doing
all the rituals of the Vedas, if you do not

00:10:02.264 --> 00:10:10.924
become vida, means self-realized, vida word
means "to know", if you don't know the Divine

00:10:10.924 --> 00:10:19.834
on your central nervous system, then you are
just missing the point.

00:10:19.834 --> 00:10:23.295
It is all useless for you to read Vedas.

00:10:23.295 --> 00:10:30.674
So He went into various areas of search.

00:10:30.674 --> 00:10:42.415
As today we find many seekers have been going
to many people to find out the truth.

00:10:42.415 --> 00:10:46.505
And He was tired, very tired.

00:10:46.505 --> 00:10:56.855
He thought all His seeking, all His working
hard, all His efforts, everything had just

00:10:56.855 --> 00:10:58.155
made Him tired.

00:10:58.155 --> 00:11:03.555
And He thought it was all fruitless.

00:11:03.555 --> 00:11:18.644
So, He was lying under a Banyan tree, and
there the Adi Shakti gave Him Realization.

00:11:18.644 --> 00:11:30.955
When all your searches are over - people search
in money, in power, in love, and all kinds

00:11:30.955 --> 00:11:31.955
of things.

00:11:31.955 --> 00:11:41.065
Ultimately people start searching in various
groups, cults, gurus, all kinds of things

00:11:41.065 --> 00:11:47.245
- drugs, alcohol's, whichever way are possible
they try to search.

00:11:47.245 --> 00:11:53.725
But when human beings try to search something,
then in their movement they either go to the

00:11:53.725 --> 00:11:57.375
left or to the right.

00:11:57.375 --> 00:12:06.924
And He, being such an ardent seeker, and such
a truthful seeker, He could see very clearly

00:12:06.924 --> 00:12:11.375
that this is not the point of going left or
right.

00:12:11.375 --> 00:12:15.465
But there has to be some ascent, but how to
achieve it?

00:12:15.465 --> 00:12:19.455
Who is going to give Him Self-Realization?

00:12:19.455 --> 00:12:28.795
All that tiredness He laid down Himself under
the tree and suddenly He got His Realization.

00:12:28.795 --> 00:12:42.445
When He got His Realization, He started understanding
why this problem of conditioning and ego is

00:12:42.445 --> 00:12:43.445
there.

00:12:43.445 --> 00:12:53.245
He found out one thing: that people when they
read too much, and try to understand - through

00:12:53.245 --> 00:12:56.385
ritualism - God, then they develop their ego.

00:12:56.385 --> 00:13:04.725
The other side, He found out, that when people
just with some desires, go on praying to God,

00:13:04.725 --> 00:13:11.145
"Give me this, give me that", they become
mad.

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:19.715
And when He realized it, then only at that
moment when He was tired, He got His Realization.

00:13:19.715 --> 00:13:25.695
This is exactly what is happening today in
the modern times.

00:13:25.695 --> 00:13:35.395
That those who were seekers have been seeking
the Divine on the left and right hand side.

00:13:35.395 --> 00:13:39.015
Nowadays they are jogging.

00:13:39.015 --> 00:13:42.245
I don't know what they're going to achieve
through jogging.

00:13:42.245 --> 00:13:44.755
They're jogging like mad.

00:13:44.755 --> 00:13:51.975
Then there are ardent Christians, ardent Muslims,
fighting the whole world for their religion,

00:13:51.975 --> 00:13:58.395
for their God, for in the name of Mohammed
Sahib, in the name of Krishna, in the name

00:13:58.395 --> 00:14:02.555
of everything.

00:14:02.555 --> 00:14:07.505
Then they think their religion is in danger.

00:14:07.505 --> 00:14:09.295
I mean it is not.

00:14:09.295 --> 00:14:16.695
Neither the prophets nor the incarnations,
nobody is in danger, not at all.

00:14:16.695 --> 00:14:20.795
How can they be?

00:14:20.795 --> 00:14:25.155
And no religion if it is true religion can
be in danger.

00:14:25.155 --> 00:14:30.215
But this He only realized after His Realization.

00:14:30.215 --> 00:14:39.585
But His followers who came did not see the
point that ultimately it is Self-Realization

00:14:39.585 --> 00:14:41.725
He is talking.

00:14:41.725 --> 00:14:47.365
Actually he took all the care to see that
people should get their Self-Realization first.

00:14:47.365 --> 00:14:48.655
Then anything else.

00:14:48.655 --> 00:14:53.125
First of all He said, "You are not going to
worship Me."

00:14:53.125 --> 00:15:04.325
As you know we don't allow people to come
for My Puja unless and until they are fully

00:15:04.325 --> 00:15:07.115
established in Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:13.935
So He first said that, "You should be fully
established in your Self-Realization, that's

00:15:13.935 --> 00:15:15.375
all."

00:15:15.375 --> 00:15:24.605
He would not talk about God, because once
you start talking about God, then He saw all

00:15:24.605 --> 00:15:28.135
these horrible religions coming up in the
name of God.

00:15:28.135 --> 00:15:35.615
When I first came to America, you will be
surprised, I did not talk of God, I did not

00:15:35.615 --> 00:15:41.785
talk of bhoots, I did not talk of any religion.

00:15:41.785 --> 00:15:45.355
I just talked about Self-Realization.

00:15:45.355 --> 00:15:52.695
The reason was, I thought, if you get your
Self-Realization then you'll understand the

00:15:52.695 --> 00:16:06.205
rest of it, but no use talking to you -

00:16:06.205 --> 00:16:15.885
about God or about Divine because first thing
is you must have your eyes, you must have

00:16:15.885 --> 00:16:20.335
the light, otherwise what's the use of talking
about these things.

00:16:20.335 --> 00:16:25.655
But it so happened that Buddha did not give
anybody Realization.

00:16:25.655 --> 00:16:32.675
So it was all right for Him to talk about
the Spirit and not about God or any religion,

00:16:32.675 --> 00:16:38.885
to such an extent that people say that Buddha
was an atheist - He did not believe in God.

00:16:38.885 --> 00:16:47.755
No, it was a matter of His policy that He
did not want to talk about God.

00:16:47.755 --> 00:16:57.375
But what I found when I came to America that
this world is full of all kinds of things.

00:16:57.375 --> 00:17:02.375
Firstly the tremendous ego that they have.

00:17:02.375 --> 00:17:06.565
And secondly they are so much conditioned.

00:17:06.565 --> 00:17:18.085
There were so many witchcrafts and forces,
I mean openly they are saying, "This is a

00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:19.285
witchcraft's school."

00:17:19.285 --> 00:17:20.285
Openly.

00:17:20.285 --> 00:17:24.105
Or, "This is a satanic powers school."

00:17:24.105 --> 00:17:27.855
All kinds, I was surprised, openly saying
like that.

00:17:27.855 --> 00:17:35.195
And when I came to San Diego first, because
I came on My own, and the people who invited

00:17:35.195 --> 00:17:42.305
Me had an organization called "parapsychology"
- is all bhoots.

00:17:42.305 --> 00:17:49.445
So they took Me round in a huge, big hall
and there were lots of people sitting down

00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:51.965
and I saw all the bhoots.

00:17:51.965 --> 00:17:54.835
(Shri Mataji laughing) I said, "Now what should
I do?

00:17:54.835 --> 00:17:55.835
Should I say the truth or not?

00:17:55.835 --> 00:17:58.855
They might start getting angry with Me."

00:17:58.855 --> 00:18:05.615
But I said, "Better to tell them, because
once they are lost in the bhoots, then what

00:18:05.615 --> 00:18:07.355
will I do with them?"

00:18:07.355 --> 00:18:10.765
So I told them, "This is all wrong, this is
all bhootish, it is all nonsense, you just

00:18:10.765 --> 00:18:18.655
don't fall a prey to all these things, this
is not correct, you better get your Realization!"

00:18:18.655 --> 00:18:23.915
And see, some people did get Realization,
and some people did leave that organization.

00:18:23.915 --> 00:18:35.855
Now, last time when I came I discovered in
'83 that the lady who was in charge sort of

00:18:35.855 --> 00:18:47.335
a person, has become mad and the gentleman
who was organizing all that has become bankrupt

00:18:47.536 --> 00:18:51.634
and has gone to Australia and the building
has collapsed.

00:18:51.835 --> 00:18:55.715
The bhoots must have done the job.

00:18:55.715 --> 00:19:05.405
It was such a problem for Me in those days
to talk against all this nonsense.

00:19:05.405 --> 00:19:06.405
Then I went to some churches, they invited
Me.

00:19:06.405 --> 00:19:13.535
Now, in the church suddenly I found eight
or ten bhootish people got up and started

00:19:13.535 --> 00:19:14.535
dancing.

00:19:14.535 --> 00:19:17.395
I said, "Where am I now?"

00:19:17.395 --> 00:19:25.075
(Shri Mataji laughing &amp; laughter) I am here to
tell them about the Spirit and see the condition

00:19:25.075 --> 00:19:26.075
here.

00:19:26.075 --> 00:19:32.875
What am I to tell them and they ardently
believed that I was an agent of God, of course,

00:19:32.875 --> 00:19:35.135
but God meaning bhoot.

00:19:35.135 --> 00:19:42.615
It was impossible to understand how far people
have gone.

00:19:42.615 --> 00:19:50.655
At the same time there was an onslaught of
all the fake gurus at that time and when I

00:19:50.655 --> 00:19:56.115
said, "You cannot pay for it" they said, "You
better go back.

00:19:56.115 --> 00:19:57.935
We don't want you."

00:19:57.935 --> 00:20:04.685
So I went away and then came back after nine
years.

00:20:04.685 --> 00:20:14.525
So Buddha tried to talk only about Self-Realization
and not about God at all.

00:20:14.525 --> 00:20:23.855
But His followers as they are always one better
than the other, tried to create a Buddhism

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:28.075
of their own style.

00:20:28.276 --> 00:20:32.544
And in this Buddhism, whatever He had told,
they did not observe it.

00:20:32.745 --> 00:20:38.835
Firstly He thought if there is ritualism and
puja an all that, before Realization where

00:20:38.835 --> 00:20:42.295
will they land up?

00:20:42.295 --> 00:20:49.975
So He said, "All right, you do not do any
puja to Me!

00:20:49.975 --> 00:20:53.374
Do not built any monument in My name!

00:20:53.374 --> 00:20:58.205
You should not worship anything!"

00:20:58.205 --> 00:20:59.505
So what did they do?

00:20:59.505 --> 00:21:07.035
They are worshipping His teeth, they are worshipping
His nails, they are worshipping His hair.

00:21:07.035 --> 00:21:18.425
Now say, for example, if you get My hair and
you are not a Realized Soul, what is the difference

00:21:18.425 --> 00:21:20.625
between My hair or anybody's hair?

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:23.315
Just the same.

00:21:23.315 --> 00:21:29.645
Without Realization all this worship took
them to very bhootish area.

00:21:29.645 --> 00:21:35.765
That's how we find the Buddhists who are nowhere
near Buddha.

00:21:35.765 --> 00:21:41.445
Like if you go to Japan, you can't believe
they can be Buddhist.

00:21:41.445 --> 00:21:46.795
They are supposed to be Buddhist - Buddha
who is the compassionate.

00:21:46.795 --> 00:21:54.045
Then we have got Chinese who followed Buddhism.

00:21:54.045 --> 00:21:57.345
They couldn't understand Buddhism either.

00:21:57.345 --> 00:22:05.005
And we have Tibetans where we had these horrible
lamas and we had other people in Ladakh and

00:22:05.005 --> 00:22:06.005
all that.

00:22:06.005 --> 00:22:12.755
They are all doing nothing else but bhoot-vidya,
prita-vidya, smashaan vidya.

00:22:12.755 --> 00:22:18.585
So even His advent amounted to the same thing
as everybody's.

00:22:18.585 --> 00:22:28.965
Now Buddha told three things which are very
important, which are very useful for Sahaja

00:22:28.965 --> 00:22:31.575
Yogis to follow.

00:22:31.575 --> 00:22:40.455
He said, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami.

00:22:40.455 --> 00:22:46.615
- I surrender myself to the enlightened one."

00:22:46.615 --> 00:22:47.685
Means what?

00:22:47.685 --> 00:22:52.595
I surrender myself to the one who is enlightened.

00:22:52.595 --> 00:22:56.285
In this case one can say it was Buddha.

00:22:56.285 --> 00:23:00.045
In your case it is your Spirit.

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:04.235
You surrender yourself to your Spirit.

00:23:04.235 --> 00:23:05.955
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:23:05.955 --> 00:23:10.465
Buddha means the one which knows.

00:23:10.465 --> 00:23:19.715
Then He says another thing, "Dhammam Sharanam
Gachami" means surrender yourself to the religion,

00:23:19.715 --> 00:23:23.805
which is true religion, which is the balance.

00:23:23.805 --> 00:23:33.515
Now as you see, all these man-made religions
are so funny and you can't make much out of

00:23:33.515 --> 00:23:34.515
them.

00:23:34.515 --> 00:23:40.675
You can't explain if these are religions or these
are Mafias.

00:23:40.675 --> 00:23:52.385
The reason is, Buddha said, "You surrender
yourselves to Dharma."

00:23:52.385 --> 00:23:58.735
So the Buddhist thought, "surrender to Dharma"
means what you have to do is to become like

00:23:58.735 --> 00:24:06.485
Buddhist - means wear a dress like a Buddhist,
like Buddha used to wear.

00:24:06.485 --> 00:24:12.175
You don't become by wearing that dress Buddha,
do you?

00:24:12.175 --> 00:24:14.745
Or then they thought, "We should do something
more."

00:24:14.745 --> 00:24:24.655
So some Buddhist got hold of a wheel, because
He talked of a wheel-of-life and all that.

00:24:24.655 --> 00:24:32.234
Absolutely, I should say, very unintelligent
way of understanding Buddha.

00:24:32.234 --> 00:24:36.295
And they would go on, you see, moving that
wheel like mad.

00:24:36.295 --> 00:24:38.785
You can't talk to them.

00:24:38.785 --> 00:24:41.705
You say, "Now, where is that road?"

00:24:41.705 --> 00:24:42.705
"Buddha."

00:24:42.705 --> 00:24:46.195
(Laughter) "How do we go there?"

00:24:46.195 --> 00:24:49.405
(Laughter) Everything has an answer.

00:24:49.405 --> 00:24:53.255
So I said, "Please answer Me."

00:24:53.255 --> 00:24:55.825
"This is the answer."

00:24:55.825 --> 00:25:02.915
So what is this answer going on?

00:25:02.915 --> 00:25:07.685
Then these people thought we should find out
new methods.

00:25:07.685 --> 00:25:16.975
So some of them took to again Upanishadas
and started using also from there, making

00:25:16.975 --> 00:25:25.735
jataka kathas like the stories which are very
absurd, funny stories, mysterious stories,

00:25:25.735 --> 00:25:28.975
this story, that story.

00:25:28.975 --> 00:25:41.845
At the same time Hinduism took another funny
role and they had a big assault of tantrikas.

00:25:41.845 --> 00:25:52.295
And when the tantrikas came in they brought
all kinds of ugly, horrible things in the

00:25:52.295 --> 00:25:59.475
- say about the sixth century it started.

00:25:59.475 --> 00:26:12.065
And a complete belt starting beyond Calcutta
going towards Dwarika, complete belt got involved

00:26:12.065 --> 00:26:14.105
into tantrism.

00:26:14.105 --> 00:26:19.815
So the same Buddhist later on, followed the
same tantric methods.

00:26:19.815 --> 00:26:27.715
So they tried to bring in everything from
this place, that place and a mixture, so now

00:26:27.715 --> 00:26:34.445
if you ask, "Now what's your religion?" they
say, "I'm Buddhist."

00:26:34.445 --> 00:26:35.665
"What Buddhist?"

00:26:35.665 --> 00:26:37.495
- "Dinayan, hinayan,

00:26:37.495 --> 00:26:42.995
I'm Zen - this, that, all kinds of Buddhism is
there.

00:26:42.995 --> 00:26:48.415
Is impossible to understand really where is
Buddhism there.

00:26:48.415 --> 00:26:49.525
So what do these do?

00:26:49.525 --> 00:26:51.585
One will shave their hair.

00:26:51.585 --> 00:26:53.645
One will shave their moustache.

00:26:53.645 --> 00:26:56.035
Another one will wear this kind of a dress.

00:26:56.035 --> 00:27:00.325
(Shri Mataji laughing) This is the only difference
between from one to another.

00:27:00.325 --> 00:27:07.125
But the common point is that they are all
cheats, they all can deceive you, they can

00:27:07.125 --> 00:27:09.125
tell lies without feeling funny.

00:27:09.125 --> 00:27:13.345
They are very sly, very cunning and suicidal.

00:27:13.345 --> 00:27:22.505
They can be very violent and the only desire
they have is to kill everybody who comes across.

00:27:22.505 --> 00:27:30.375
This is where Buddha's Buddhism has ended
up.

00:27:30.375 --> 00:27:36.225
So now we are face to face with Buddha.

00:27:36.225 --> 00:27:43.175
But what He talked about was a spontaneous
happening of Self-Realization.

00:27:43.175 --> 00:27:46.135
And He said, "You prepare yourself."

00:27:46.135 --> 00:27:52.754
All the time He said, "You prepare yourself
for Self-Realization and try to watch everything

00:27:52.754 --> 00:27:53.754
without desire."

00:27:53.754 --> 00:27:58.925
This was just preparation for Sahaja Yoga
He was talking about.

00:27:58.925 --> 00:28:13.675
But as you see, all the Buddhists today, if
you see them you'll be amazed that they are

00:28:13.675 --> 00:28:15.315
neither here nor there.

00:28:15.315 --> 00:28:20.765
You just don't know how to place them, how
to understand them, how to make them feel

00:28:20.765 --> 00:28:23.445
what Buddha taught or Zen has taught.

00:28:23.445 --> 00:28:27.835
They are not in a condition to understand
anything.

00:28:27.835 --> 00:28:37.385
It's like, you see, the brain of a person
who is having all kinds of thoughts, like

00:28:37.385 --> 00:28:42.225
all the pebbles in one little pot, making
noise.

00:28:42.225 --> 00:28:45.965
God knows which one is making which noise.

00:28:45.965 --> 00:28:52.695
And that's why today you find here is one
Lama, who was a guru of Hitler.

00:28:52.695 --> 00:28:56.185
Imagine: Hitler's guru was Lama!

00:28:56.185 --> 00:29:01.795
Now this mister Lama is going round the whole
world with his wrinkles which can be counted

00:29:01.795 --> 00:29:05.415
one by one and asking for money.

00:29:05.415 --> 00:29:06.965
Why does he want money for?

00:29:06.965 --> 00:29:17.075
He is the one who ran away from Tibet, from
Lhasa.

00:29:17.075 --> 00:29:21.285
And while running away he carried such a lot
of gold with him that he could not carry.

00:29:21.285 --> 00:29:26.425
So half of it he dropped it in the river and
with the half of it he reached India.

00:29:26.425 --> 00:29:32.935
With the half of it already he has made a
huge, big Buddha of gold, he has too much

00:29:32.935 --> 00:29:34.135
gold with him.

00:29:34.135 --> 00:29:43.665
And the rest of the gold that was salvaged,
was taken to Russia - to China, where I've

00:29:43.665 --> 00:29:45.295
seen it Myself.

00:29:45.295 --> 00:29:46.295
Amazed.

00:29:46.496 --> 00:29:54.014
He had gold, beer mugs, what you call
them, the huge, big things, like that.

00:29:54.215 --> 00:29:55.375
Real gold.

00:29:55.375 --> 00:30:00.385
And such big plates of real gold for eating
food.

00:30:00.385 --> 00:30:01.385
Imagine!

00:30:01.385 --> 00:30:10.435
Buddha talked of detachment, and they had
everything in gold or silver of a very expensive

00:30:10.435 --> 00:30:12.155
quality.

00:30:12.155 --> 00:30:15.625
If you see their robe, clothes and all that
you'd be amazed.

00:30:15.625 --> 00:30:23.945
Though they wore all those things as robes
of renunciation, but whenever they sat in

00:30:23.744 --> 00:30:32.224
their own courtyard - courts and things like
that, inside all that they wore - inside wore

00:30:32.425 --> 00:30:40.615
all those dresses which were very heavily
done with real gold, with pearls and things,

00:30:40.615 --> 00:30:46.095
because I've seen with My own eyes.

00:30:46.095 --> 00:30:49.245
I was amazed.

00:30:49.245 --> 00:30:53.065
So it is like somebody who says, "Oh, I must
get detached.

00:30:53.065 --> 00:30:54.925
Now I'm going to the seashore.

00:30:54.925 --> 00:30:58.165
I'm going to sit there and meditate."

00:30:58.165 --> 00:31:01.585
There he goes, and makes a compound round
himself.

00:31:01.585 --> 00:31:06.245
So I ask him, "Why have you made a compound?", "You
know, maybe thieves might come in."

00:31:06.245 --> 00:31:10.925
I mean you are detached what does it matter
if a thief comes, he will take you away, so

00:31:10.925 --> 00:31:11.925
what?

00:31:11.925 --> 00:31:15.305
You are there, doesn't matter, you can go
with a thief, you can go with anyone.

00:31:15.305 --> 00:31:17.065
Why are you worried about the thief?

00:31:17.065 --> 00:31:18.375
You are detached.

00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:22.075
"Oh, you see, I am also worried that there
might be pick-pockets."

00:31:22.075 --> 00:31:25.625
"So why are you worried about pick-pockets?"

00:31:25.625 --> 00:31:32.405
"Because maybe I have some money with me here,
and I have my bank account and I have my other, other

00:31:32.204 --> 00:31:36.744
things with me, so I am rather worried, see,
that a thief might come."

00:31:36.945 --> 00:31:40.015
So why do you talk of detachment?

00:31:40.015 --> 00:31:42.315
Why do you talk of sanyasa?

00:31:42.315 --> 00:31:52.275
So this kind of a nonsensical sanyasa started
after Buddha died, which was so very shocking.

00:31:52.275 --> 00:32:01.275
This led people to think that you can wear
any time an orange dress and then you are

00:32:01.275 --> 00:32:02.275
a sanyasi.

00:32:02.275 --> 00:32:06.635
If you wear an orange dress you become Buddha,
and you become a detached personality.

00:32:06.635 --> 00:32:13.935
Now you can announce to the whole world that,
"I'm a detached personality" and what is your

00:32:13.935 --> 00:32:14.935
background?

00:32:14.935 --> 00:32:20.374
"Nothing, I just was born out of this Mother
Earth and I'm sitting here nicely like Buddha."

00:32:20.374 --> 00:32:24.135
So people stupidly start giving them money.

00:32:24.135 --> 00:32:26.504
So they get the money.

00:32:26.504 --> 00:32:31.765
But actually, the background is that the fellow
might have come out of the jail in India for

00:32:31.765 --> 00:32:38.595
burglary or something like that, and now sitting
down here as Buddha.

00:32:38.595 --> 00:32:40.955
How will you make out?

00:32:40.955 --> 00:32:46.235
"Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:32:46.235 --> 00:32:52.265
So what we have to do is to establish ourselves
in Buddha.

00:32:52.265 --> 00:32:56.945
That is to establish within ourselves in our
Spirit.

00:32:56.945 --> 00:33:05.655
Unless and until we are established in our
Spirit, we cannot understand the intricacies

00:33:05.655 --> 00:33:11.495
of all the ignorance that we have around.

00:33:11.495 --> 00:33:18.225
So the best way to understand Sahaja Yoga
is to establish yourself in the Spirit.

00:33:18.225 --> 00:33:26.985
But those who are not intelligent, those who
are stupid, those who are selfish and greedy

00:33:26.985 --> 00:33:30.485
do not see this point.

00:33:30.485 --> 00:33:37.805
And they do not like it if a leader tells
them that, "You must establish in Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:37.805 --> 00:33:40.945
that you should have your Spirit manifested."

00:33:40.945 --> 00:33:42.965
They don't want to listen to it.

00:33:42.965 --> 00:33:48.885
They want to be in the group of Sahaja Yogis
because they don't want to be lonely.

00:33:48.885 --> 00:33:57.645
They would like to sing songs, music, everything
in Sahaja Yoga because they want somewhere

00:33:57.645 --> 00:34:03.845
to fit in, because they want an identity,
they call themselves Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:03.845 --> 00:34:08.895
But this identity is a false identity.

00:34:08.895 --> 00:34:13.645
You have to be identified with your Spirit.

00:34:13.645 --> 00:34:18.275
That is the part is, "Buddham Sharanam Gachami."

00:34:18.275 --> 00:34:22.755
The second is, "Dhammam Sharanam Gachami."

00:34:22.755 --> 00:34:25.025
What is "Dhammam", is Dharma.

00:34:25.025 --> 00:34:29.395
What is our Dharma, is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:34:29.395 --> 00:34:33.254
That means now we have become universal beings.

00:34:33.254 --> 00:34:42.825
We are no more Indians, no more Africans,
no more English, no more French.

00:34:42.825 --> 00:34:57.655
We all have become now Sahaja Yogis who are
the citizens of the Kingdom of God.

00:34:57.655 --> 00:35:00.865
We have no other identification.

00:35:00.865 --> 00:35:03.475
This is our Dharma.

00:35:03.475 --> 00:35:10.615
We are now leading a universal life.

00:35:10.615 --> 00:35:17.765
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

00:35:17.765 --> 00:35:24.835
Still, so many of them still identify themselves
with some localized stuff.

00:35:24.835 --> 00:35:34.325
Now when we think of universality we have
to understand, that it's not only the religion

00:35:34.325 --> 00:35:40.745
or a country that separates us, but also a
kind of a quality.

00:35:40.745 --> 00:35:48.045
For example, if there are people who are Rajo-gunis
who are very active, right-sided people, they'll

00:35:48.045 --> 00:35:49.285
combine together.

00:35:49.285 --> 00:35:51.885
They may fight later but they combine.

00:35:51.885 --> 00:36:00.244
Then the people who are left-sided will combine
together, but both of these should cling onto

00:36:00.043 --> 00:36:08.654
those who are trying to ascend, who are in
the center.

00:36:08.855 --> 00:36:12.515
And there where we fail very much.

00:36:12.515 --> 00:36:24.525
Our associations and our understandings of
each other is deluded by our ignorance and

00:36:24.525 --> 00:36:37.895
we cannot understand who is for our ascent
and who is for our benevolence.

00:36:37.895 --> 00:36:41.715
This happens with us in so many ways.

00:36:41.715 --> 00:36:48.265
We are universal beings and our culture is
"Sahaja Culture."

00:36:48.265 --> 00:36:51.385
We have given up all our nonsensical cultures.

00:36:51.385 --> 00:36:59.345
In every religion, in every country we have
seen the nonsense of our culture, so we believe

00:36:59.345 --> 00:37:03.624
in the spontaneous culture of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:03.624 --> 00:37:06.555
So we are universal beings.

00:37:06.555 --> 00:37:15.805
And in this state of being universal being
you have to develop your collective consciousness.

00:37:15.805 --> 00:37:27.685
As first one is for individual, "Buddham Sharanam
Gacchami" - I surrender myself to Buddha.

00:37:27.685 --> 00:37:34.995
The second one is the one, I surrender myself
to the collective - in the sense, into the

00:37:34.995 --> 00:37:38.555
Dharma, the essence of the collective.

00:37:38.555 --> 00:37:41.725
Now what is the essence of our collective?

00:37:41.725 --> 00:37:48.695
What binds us together is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,
the Pure Religion of the Universe.

00:37:48.695 --> 00:37:56.814
So once you understand that this is the thing
that binds you to each other, you must understand

00:37:56.814 --> 00:38:02.015
how important it is to keep to Vishwa Nirmala
Dharma.

00:38:02.015 --> 00:38:09.805
In so many ways I have been able to tell you
what is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

00:38:09.805 --> 00:38:21.104
So we have to understand the full content
of the Dharma that we are following and also

00:38:21.104 --> 00:38:27.795
to reflect it back to see, "Are we really
following this religion?"

00:38:27.795 --> 00:38:31.785
But in falsehood I have seen like somebody's
a Christian.

00:38:31.785 --> 00:38:38.345
Every Sunday he'll get up, dress up nicely,
go to the church, get up three times, four

00:38:38.345 --> 00:38:43.665
times, sing songs, this thing, do everything,
pay the money to the priest, pay to the church,

00:38:43.665 --> 00:38:52.125
pay to that, and then he thinks he has done
the job.

00:38:52.125 --> 00:38:55.165
Very religiously he'll go and confess.

00:38:55.165 --> 00:39:00.335
Muslims, very religiously will do some things
which we cannot really understand.

00:39:00.335 --> 00:39:07.855
As in Spain I was told that people try
to crucify themselves, as a drama of course,

00:39:07.855 --> 00:39:16.585
but they do it just to protect Christianity
I think, and to crucify - God knows what!

00:39:16.585 --> 00:39:24.405
Then there are people in India who are following
Hinduism and the first principle, the basic

00:39:24.405 --> 00:39:28.605
principle of Hinduism, that there is Spirit
in everyone.

00:39:28.605 --> 00:39:33.585
So how can you have caste and subcaste and this and that?

00:39:33.585 --> 00:39:37.455
If everybody has the Spirit you can't have
caste, subcaste.

00:39:37.455 --> 00:39:41.305
You cannot have division like that.

00:39:41.305 --> 00:39:48.345
So what we find in every religion, there are
problematic things but once you come to this

00:39:48.345 --> 00:39:55.064
pure religion, then you see the essence of
it and the essence of it is that, that we

00:39:55.064 --> 00:40:01.935
are all Spirit and we are all related to each
other, we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:40:01.935 --> 00:40:03.795
So you go to the collective.

00:40:03.795 --> 00:40:08.305
So at the end He said, "Sangham Sharanam Gachami."

00:40:08.305 --> 00:40:12.075
This is the very important point also.

00:40:12.075 --> 00:40:20.465
It's the most important thing is this "Sangham
Sharanam Gachami."

00:40:20.465 --> 00:40:27.895
For example, we say that you surrender yourself
to collectivity.

00:40:27.895 --> 00:40:28.915
What does that mean?

00:40:28.915 --> 00:40:30.375
What does that entail (it is)?

00:40:30.375 --> 00:40:40.925
As I was talking to your leaders here, I said,
"All of you should form one collective unit,

00:40:40.925 --> 00:40:42.635
a 'Sangham'."

00:40:42.635 --> 00:40:49.715
All the leaders have to know that they love
Mother from their heart, and they should never

00:40:49.715 --> 00:41:01.105
try to cut each other because somebody's trying
to tell them against them.

00:41:01.105 --> 00:41:04.097
They should have love for each other.

00:41:04.097 --> 00:41:05.985
For example there's one Mr. X, who's a leader.

00:41:05.985 --> 00:41:15.115
Now a negative force incarnates and comes
and tells the leader that, "See the other

00:41:15.115 --> 00:41:16.365
leader is my supporter."

00:41:16.365 --> 00:41:23.205
So this fellow has a bad feeling, the another
leader has another bad feeling.

00:41:23.205 --> 00:41:24.915
This is going against "Sangha."

00:41:24.915 --> 00:41:31.965
First the Sangha of the collectivity of the
leaders has to be fully appreciated.

00:41:31.965 --> 00:41:37.085
I enjoy the way when all these leaders meet
and beat each other nicely and enjoy each

00:41:37.085 --> 00:41:46.005
other, pull each other's legs and love each
other and patronize the younger ones and look

00:41:46.005 --> 00:41:47.005
after.

00:41:47.005 --> 00:41:48.165
That's the beginning of Sangha.

00:41:48.165 --> 00:41:53.325
If the leaders are not in Sangha, what other
Sangha we can form?

00:41:53.325 --> 00:41:56.685
So the first is the Sangha of the leaders
is there.

00:41:56.685 --> 00:42:02.805
All those who try to break that Sangha must
know that they are negative people and they

00:42:02.604 --> 00:42:05.364
are going to stab us.

00:42:05.565 --> 00:42:09.955
Anybody who tries that, you should be very
careful.

00:42:09.955 --> 00:42:15.185
The second Sangha, collectivity, is among
the Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:15.185 --> 00:42:23.985
Now we are not, as I told you, Indians, or
we are not English or Americans or anything,

00:42:23.985 --> 00:42:26.475
so we should not form groups.

00:42:26.475 --> 00:42:32.925
What you'll find always, if there are five
Americans they'll stick on to each other as

00:42:32.724 --> 00:42:36.694
if they have been glued, and they can't move
away from each other.

00:42:36.895 --> 00:42:38.285
All of them will be together.

00:42:38.285 --> 00:42:43.064
If there are Indians, they will stick on together.

00:42:43.064 --> 00:42:48.385
If there are other kinds, they'll all stick
on together.

00:42:48.385 --> 00:42:51.155
Now we are no more that.

00:42:51.155 --> 00:42:52.554
It's finished!

00:42:52.554 --> 00:42:54.775
So what is there to glue to each other?

00:42:54.775 --> 00:42:56.125
But it happens.

00:42:56.125 --> 00:42:58.605
We always glue to each other.

00:42:58.605 --> 00:43:00.995
I don't know why.

00:43:00.995 --> 00:43:02.825
What is the need to do that?

00:43:02.825 --> 00:43:10.315
And very commonly we see that in India people
are behaving in a very funny manner.

00:43:10.315 --> 00:43:16.425
Last year I did not know, but people told
Me that some group came and they were all

00:43:16.425 --> 00:43:24.085
the time saying, "We are a great nation, we
are a great nation."

00:43:24.085 --> 00:43:28.035
They are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:28.035 --> 00:43:38.755
Our nation is Kingdom of God and our King
is God Almighty and we have no other King

00:43:38.755 --> 00:43:41.425
and no other nation.

00:43:41.425 --> 00:43:52.085
If you cannot transcend those barriers of
stupid limitations you cannot become Sahaja

00:43:52.085 --> 00:43:53.285
Yogis.

00:43:53.285 --> 00:43:56.415
But this is in a very gross way.

00:43:56.415 --> 00:44:06.395
But in a very subtle way, I see a lady who
is catching or who has badha will immediately

00:44:06.395 --> 00:44:08.525
crawl into another one - somehow.

00:44:08.525 --> 00:44:11.955
She may belong to any country, doesn't matter.

00:44:11.955 --> 00:44:21.815
You see, a bhootish woman, say, coming from
India, will crawl up to another one in Australia.

00:44:21.614 --> 00:44:23.354
Straight forward, march!

00:44:23.555 --> 00:44:27.055
Just start watching, "Where is she going?

00:44:27.055 --> 00:44:29.405
Oh God, that's it!"

00:44:29.405 --> 00:44:35.885
So the bhoots are very collective, a big fraternity,
great fraternity.

00:44:35.885 --> 00:44:41.585
If they see somebody who is possessed, this
bhootish person will immediately go to her.

00:44:41.585 --> 00:44:48.765
It is very surprising that the bhoots are
so collective.

00:44:48.765 --> 00:44:52.965
Apart from that, they know Me very well.

00:44:52.965 --> 00:44:54.905
They understand Me very well.

00:44:54.905 --> 00:45:01.885
Even a little child if he is caught up will
start crying before Me, shaking before Me,

00:45:01.885 --> 00:45:03.675
not coming before Me.

00:45:03.675 --> 00:45:10.515
But when they are realized, they don't understand
and moreover they don't understand a simple

00:45:10.515 --> 00:45:15.925
principle that we are now possessed by our
own Spirit and we are one.

00:45:15.925 --> 00:45:27.165
So they should stick on more to the person
who is a spiritually evolved personality.

00:45:27.165 --> 00:45:35.185
But instead of that, for them some "third-rater"
something is much more important than a person

00:45:35.185 --> 00:45:39.175
who is such a highly developed person.

00:45:39.175 --> 00:45:42.025
This is where we fail in our collective.

00:45:42.025 --> 00:45:47.314
A very subtle method of these negative people.

00:45:47.314 --> 00:45:51.855
Just finding out how to form a big formidable
group to attack.

00:45:51.855 --> 00:45:57.415
With that you lose your vibrations.

00:45:57.415 --> 00:46:04.755
Once you lose your vibrations then you say,
"Oh, this is too much.

00:46:04.755 --> 00:46:06.675
We must have compassion.

00:46:06.675 --> 00:46:08.645
We must have love.

00:46:08.645 --> 00:46:12.495
After all we are all Sahaja Yogis."

00:46:12.495 --> 00:46:17.895
So it's the compassion and love of bhoots
among themselves.

00:46:17.895 --> 00:46:22.625
They are talking of compassion to each other.

00:46:22.625 --> 00:46:28.355
Even with Me they said, "Mother, you have
to be kind."

00:46:28.355 --> 00:46:35.695
I said, "Are you more compassionate than Me
that you are teaching Me?"

00:46:35.695 --> 00:46:45.525
If I'm saying anything to this lady taking
all My breath and all My energy on her, then

00:46:45.324 --> 00:46:50.354
I'm doing it for her benevolence and it's
My compassion that is [why/working], but what you

00:46:50.555 --> 00:46:58.765
are doing is not for the benevolence but for
the destruction of that person.

00:46:58.765 --> 00:47:04.865
So no use supporting someone who is negative.

00:47:04.865 --> 00:47:10.165
Many negative persons who have been asked
to get out of Sahaja Yoga sometimes create

00:47:10.165 --> 00:47:17.125
this problem of coming, "Oh Mother, you know,
I'm so good, but they tortured me, they troubled

00:47:17.125 --> 00:47:18.275
me so much."

00:47:18.275 --> 00:47:20.265
Now I'm seeing a bhoot in the person.

00:47:20.265 --> 00:47:22.585
I can clearly see.

00:47:22.585 --> 00:47:29.505
I can see the negativity, but if you do not
see, you will immediately start taking sides,

00:47:29.505 --> 00:47:34.445
"Oh God, look at this, poor thing is tortured."

00:47:34.445 --> 00:47:40.265
You lose your vibrations, you won't be able
to find out!

00:47:40.265 --> 00:47:45.155
So don't come under the spell of these murmuring
souls, as Christ has called.

00:47:45.155 --> 00:47:50.305
He said, "Murmuring souls are the greatest
danger."

00:47:50.305 --> 00:47:52.215
That I've seen in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:52.215 --> 00:48:00.575
Those who murmur, talk at the back, go on
complaining are the greatest danger to Sahaja

00:48:00.575 --> 00:48:03.555
Yoga and ultimately to themselves.

00:48:03.555 --> 00:48:06.544
Because they'll be found out.

00:48:06.544 --> 00:48:16.105
So this is the another situation into which
we are not collective and when we are collective,

00:48:16.105 --> 00:48:24.445
we are collective for something which is not
ascending force.

00:48:24.445 --> 00:48:37.685
It is something surprising how we see people
in this world are inviting their destruction

00:48:37.685 --> 00:48:47.695
and we too, in a way, when we don't understand
what is collectivity, try to destroy our body

00:48:47.695 --> 00:48:52.505
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:52.505 --> 00:48:59.545
Today I'm telling you this because all these
things must be stopped now on the day of Buddha's

00:48:59.545 --> 00:49:00.814
birth.

00:49:00.814 --> 00:49:07.385
Buddha is the one who is in charge of your
ego.

00:49:07.385 --> 00:49:15.705
If you go beyond Buddha and start showing
off too much, then He pushes your ego into

00:49:15.705 --> 00:49:17.335
your left Vishuddhi.

00:49:17.335 --> 00:49:23.015
So you develop your left Vishuddhi and when
you develop your left Vishuddhi, what happens?

00:49:23.015 --> 00:49:28.615
That you start feeling guilty, meaning you
do not want to face the situation at all,

00:49:28.615 --> 00:49:31.525
but you say "Oh, I'm very guilty.

00:49:31.525 --> 00:49:36.085
I've killed you, all right, I've killed you,
I'm feeling guilty."

00:49:36.085 --> 00:49:38.715
We never face the situation.

00:49:38.715 --> 00:49:44.625
This is the ego which goes into the left and
creates this problem of left Vishuddhi.

00:49:44.625 --> 00:49:51.975
It's not by any chance your style of bearing
up things, or you are being suppressed.

00:49:51.975 --> 00:50:03.015
But no, you have been oppressing others, you
have been egoistical and it has been so much

00:50:03.015 --> 00:50:11.375
that it has gone into the left Vishuddhi.

00:50:11.375 --> 00:50:13.485
So you are trying to justify.

00:50:13.485 --> 00:50:21.515
Now I would suggest that if you really want
to understand Sahaja Yoga, first try to understand

00:50:21.515 --> 00:50:23.085
yourself.

00:50:23.085 --> 00:50:29.585
Then you see, "Where is my mind going now?"

00:50:29.585 --> 00:50:34.294
Some ladies who are used to, say gossip, they
come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:34.294 --> 00:50:41.225
They are all right, but sometimes that thing
comes, "Let's go and gossip about this lady".

00:50:41.024 --> 00:50:47.384
They'll just get up, walk on to another one who
must have been gossiped in last life, maybe.

00:50:47.585 --> 00:50:53.055
So go and talk to that person and tell something
against that person.

00:50:53.055 --> 00:51:01.075
(Shri Mataji laughing) Then they find out
another gossiper or they get another gossiper.

00:51:01.075 --> 00:51:05.675
Now, what I find is three great Sahaja Yoginis
are sitting and gossiping there.

00:51:05.675 --> 00:51:06.675
I say, "What are you talking?"

00:51:06.675 --> 00:51:11.775
"Oh, no Mother, we were discussing Sahaja
Yoga."

00:51:11.775 --> 00:51:13.705
I said, "Really?"

00:51:13.705 --> 00:51:23.895
(Laughter) Discussing Sahaja Yogis is never
discussion on Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:23.895 --> 00:51:29.685
If you are discussing people you are not discussing
Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:29.685 --> 00:51:37.855
Discussing Sahaja Yoga has nothing to do with
human beings or with Realized souls.

00:51:37.855 --> 00:51:46.544
Thank God, you don't discuss Me, because I
must be making lots of mistakes.

00:51:46.544 --> 00:51:53.105
In relation to your culture, in relation to
your styles, in relation to the human style.

00:51:53.105 --> 00:51:56.515
For example, you have to say, "Thank you"
ten times.

00:51:56.515 --> 00:52:00.275
I might be saying it only three times or four
times.

00:52:00.275 --> 00:52:03.005
Or you have to say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry."

00:52:03.005 --> 00:52:08.105
On the telephone even now, I never say sorry,
I say, "I beg your pardon?"

00:52:08.105 --> 00:52:11.395
But you see, people will say, "Sorry, sorry,
sorry."

00:52:11.395 --> 00:52:17.065
I start thinking, "Am I in the wrong or they
are in the wrong?"

00:52:17.065 --> 00:52:18.065
(Laughter)

00:52:18.065 --> 00:52:31.875
So when we start discussing others, what we
really do is to confront or to face someone

00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:33.935
with your own limitations.

00:52:33.935 --> 00:52:42.135
And we start thinking, "He should have done
like this, he should have ..." What about

00:52:42.135 --> 00:52:43.135
you?

00:52:43.135 --> 00:52:51.855
So best is, you discuss yourself with yourself
and you discuss Sahaja Yoga with others.

00:52:51.855 --> 00:52:56.975
This is the best way to get rid of one of
the greatest enemies of collectivity, is gossip.

00:52:56.975 --> 00:53:04.205
Is a human nature, you know, I think, to gossip.

00:53:04.205 --> 00:53:14.605
Another horrible thing we have, which Buddha
has tried to control, is a very subtle type

00:53:14.605 --> 00:53:16.974
of aggressiveness.

00:53:16.974 --> 00:53:22.205
That one of the games I play is of making
somebody a leader.

00:53:22.205 --> 00:53:23.965
It's a game, please remember.

00:53:23.965 --> 00:53:27.095
Even if I tell you, "I'm Mahamaya", you forget
it.

00:53:27.095 --> 00:53:31.855
Even if I tell you, "I'm playing a game",
still you forget it.

00:53:31.855 --> 00:53:34.335
You become so seriously leaders, you see.

00:53:34.335 --> 00:53:38.195
It's nothing to feel that you are leaders,
there's nothing like leaders, there's nothing

00:53:38.195 --> 00:53:40.645
like that in Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:40.645 --> 00:53:43.925
But then I praise some.

00:53:43.925 --> 00:53:50.005
Now I had a mind to praise people today for
yesterday's program.

00:53:50.005 --> 00:53:55.665
The way it was arranged, the way it was done
beautifully, so many people came, is remarkable.

00:53:55.665 --> 00:54:00.295
But then I was thinking, "Should I say or
not?"

00:54:00.295 --> 00:54:08.975
(Laughter) If I say, next time, God knows
what I will see.

00:54:08.975 --> 00:54:17.095
(Laughter) So encouraging like this, will
it help or not?

00:54:17.095 --> 00:54:20.065
So I've been still discreet about it.

00:54:20.065 --> 00:54:26.544
Of course, I must say, yesterday's program
was very remarkable and we must really give

00:54:26.544 --> 00:54:35.825
a hand to Dave and to the leader, our Karan.

00:54:35.825 --> 00:54:37.755
(Applause)

00:54:37.755 --> 00:54:56.875
Despite all stupid opposition and nonsense,
they have shown how they have brought in so

00:54:56.875 --> 00:55:04.045
many people to Sahaja Yoga and how with complete
concentration they have been able to establish

00:55:04.045 --> 00:55:10.314
so many in Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:10.314 --> 00:55:18.795
So it is for you to learn from it, that despite
all problems and anything, without feeling

00:55:18.795 --> 00:55:28.635
bad about it, just see that you move like
a big elephant towards giving Realization

00:55:28.635 --> 00:55:39.335
to others, creating more Sahaja Yogis and
more Sahaja Yogis in America.

00:55:39.335 --> 00:55:46.564
Those who had this aim in life that we have
to give Realization to people, we have to

00:55:46.564 --> 00:55:57.075
achieve establishment of Sahaja Yoga, they
never will have any problems of any kind.

00:55:57.075 --> 00:56:04.435
So never bring down yourself to the level
where you think that, "See, the food was not

00:56:04.435 --> 00:56:10.865
good, that was not good, this one was not
good, this fellow was torturing, that fellow

00:56:10.664 --> 00:56:12.494
was doing this."

00:56:12.695 --> 00:56:13.695
Nothing.

00:56:13.695 --> 00:56:16.365
This is not going to help you, help anyone.

00:56:16.365 --> 00:56:20.855
Not going to give you any marks, as they say.

00:56:20.855 --> 00:56:26.375
After all if you have to enter into the Kingdom
of God, one has to know that you have to have

00:56:26.375 --> 00:56:27.385
certain marks.

00:56:27.385 --> 00:56:33.975
Otherwise God will say, "You failed", (Laughter)
and you'll be surprised why the entrance is

00:56:33.975 --> 00:56:35.255
not allowed.

00:56:35.255 --> 00:56:41.595
You are thinking you are so intelligent, so
great, you see, how much gossip you have created,

00:56:41.595 --> 00:56:46.515
how much problems you have created, how many
leaders you have pulled down, how much you

00:56:46.515 --> 00:56:49.005
have befooled Mother and all that.

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:53.205
(Laughter) And there suddenly you find, "I've
failed.

00:56:53.205 --> 00:56:56.625
(Laughter) What has happened?"

00:56:56.625 --> 00:57:00.015
So don't deceive your Self.

00:57:00.015 --> 00:57:03.225
Self is the Spirit.

00:57:03.225 --> 00:57:06.105
Don't deceive your Self.

00:57:06.105 --> 00:57:12.125
If you deceive yourself, ultimately you will
be deceived and despite the fact you have

00:57:12.125 --> 00:57:18.064
been Sahaja Yogis, you have been to My Puja,
you have been here and you have been certified

00:57:17.863 --> 00:57:22.274
as Sahaja Yogis, there's light on your head,
still they will say, "Take another life,

00:57:22.475 --> 00:57:23.735
and then come back.

00:57:23.735 --> 00:57:33.075
Take another as, you see, failed, you have
to go through one year more.

00:57:33.075 --> 00:57:35.875
Try another one."

00:57:35.875 --> 00:57:36.875
(Laughter)

00:57:36.875 --> 00:57:42.015
So the easiest way to be a good Sahaja Yogi,
not to deceive your Self.

00:57:42.015 --> 00:57:43.695
Watch yourself!

00:57:43.695 --> 00:57:48.405
Where is this mind going?

00:57:48.405 --> 00:57:49.405
What am I thinking?

00:57:49.405 --> 00:57:51.175
What is my mind working now?

00:57:51.175 --> 00:57:59.405
Can I, this man is coming, can I give him
Realization?

00:57:59.204 --> 00:58:00.968
Should I start talking to him about Sahaja Yoga?

00:58:01.169 --> 00:58:04.075
Sitting in the train, you watch a person.

00:58:04.075 --> 00:58:07.465
"Ah, this is all right!

00:58:07.465 --> 00:58:10.175
Let's manage this fellow."

00:58:10.175 --> 00:58:17.554
All the time you have to catch human beings
like fishes are caught.

00:58:17.554 --> 00:58:22.455
I've taught you how to do it.

00:58:22.455 --> 00:58:26.865
To go on catching them, one by one, and create
a greater collectivity.

00:58:26.865 --> 00:58:40.435
If your attention is on that, then I will
say, "You have acted like Buddha", because

00:58:40.435 --> 00:58:43.825
Buddha just did that.

00:58:43.825 --> 00:58:49.825
From everywhere He collected people, told
them to follow a path of detachment and He

00:58:49.825 --> 00:58:55.475
asked them to wear clothes and things which
are for detachment.

00:58:55.475 --> 00:59:01.205
And He asked that you should detach yourself
from your families, everything.

00:59:01.205 --> 00:59:08.565
This, all this, He did for one thing, that
they should be prepared for today's life.

00:59:08.565 --> 00:59:15.125
That they've done all these things, but we
don't want you to wear orange dresses, we

00:59:15.125 --> 00:59:23.555
don't want you to do all these wrong things,
which are not needed today.

00:59:23.555 --> 00:59:29.075
They were all right in those days, but today
they are wrong because they are not needed.

00:59:29.075 --> 00:59:35.495
When it is not needed, why should you carry
on your head?

00:59:35.495 --> 00:59:39.655
Like the other day, I saw somebody carrying
a big boat on his head.

00:59:39.655 --> 00:59:41.345
I said, "What are you doing?"

00:59:41.345 --> 00:59:42.835
He said, "I'm carrying the boat."

00:59:42.835 --> 00:59:43.835
"For what?

00:59:43.835 --> 00:59:46.395
Why are you carrying the boat?"

00:59:46.395 --> 00:59:52.495
Said, "You see, I know there is no need to
carry the boat here because there is no sea,

00:59:52.495 --> 00:59:55.015
no water, nothing, but I'm just carrying."

00:59:55.015 --> 01:00:01.885
(Laughter) "But why are you carrying this
load upon your head?"

01:00:01.885 --> 01:00:08.345
"Ah, because I'm carrying, you know."

01:00:08.345 --> 01:00:09.425
(Laughter)

01:00:09.425 --> 01:00:11.505
That is how we are.

01:00:11.505 --> 01:00:15.544
We are carrying on with things which are not
needed.

01:00:15.544 --> 01:00:20.485
Like, "Mother, now I've been doing Hatha Yoga,
should I do some Hatha Yoga?"

01:00:20.485 --> 01:00:24.155
"But why do you want to do it?

01:00:24.155 --> 01:00:26.115
There is no need for you."

01:00:25.914 --> 01:00:31.254
"No, no, Mother, but I've been doing it."

01:00:31.455 --> 01:00:34.955
(Laughter) "So do it now, what to do?"

01:00:34.955 --> 01:00:41.515
It's as stupid as this carrying a boat on
your head, that whatever is not needed unnecessarily

01:00:41.515 --> 01:00:43.955
wasting your time.

01:00:43.955 --> 01:00:51.845
"I'm used to this, Mother, I used to do this,
so I must do it."

01:00:51.845 --> 01:00:55.765
Everything is made very easy for you in Sahaja
Yoga.

01:00:55.765 --> 01:00:56.765
Very simple.

01:00:56.765 --> 01:01:02.475
You don't have to starve, you don't have to
fast, you don't have to become vegetarians,

01:01:02.475 --> 01:01:08.054
you don't have to go and sit in the sun or
meditate on Himalayas.

01:01:08.054 --> 01:01:09.855
Nothing of the kind.

01:01:09.855 --> 01:01:14.885
Comfortably you can sit down wherever you
like and you can meditate.

01:01:14.885 --> 01:01:18.625
Everything made easy.

01:01:18.625 --> 01:01:25.845
And once you've found out your Spirit, you
can enjoy everything that's beautiful.

01:01:25.845 --> 01:01:31.595
Now on the whole, maybe for some people this
is really too much.

01:01:31.595 --> 01:01:36.845
In a Sahara Desert you are sitting, everything
blowing on your head.

01:01:36.845 --> 01:01:37.845
"What is this?

01:01:37.845 --> 01:01:38.915
How can we live here?

01:01:38.915 --> 01:01:42.355
Such a rough life!"

01:01:42.355 --> 01:01:47.225
But you don't feel that way, because you have
the comfort of the Spirit within you.

01:01:47.225 --> 01:01:50.625
It's the comfort of the Spirit.

01:01:50.625 --> 01:01:57.015
And for the comfort of Spirit you don't need
anything, that's what you have.

01:01:57.015 --> 01:02:01.745
So do not carry on with nonsensical things.

01:02:01.745 --> 01:02:03.695
Because Buddha went round and round.

01:02:03.695 --> 01:02:08.685
As we came today to this program, I was just
thinking like Buddha.

01:02:08.685 --> 01:02:13.005
Going from this end, again coming from this
end, then I couldn't find it, then that end,

01:02:13.005 --> 01:02:14.005
then coming this way.

01:02:13.804 --> 01:02:15.784
Ultimately we reached here, they said it's blocked!

01:02:15.784 --> 01:02:21.124
I said, "Give him a bandhan."

01:02:21.325 --> 01:02:23.105
Finished, open!

01:02:23.105 --> 01:02:26.195
So this was blocked, that was blocked, go
this way, that way.

01:02:26.195 --> 01:02:28.435
All right, it was blocked for Him.

01:02:28.435 --> 01:02:31.135
So He went round and round.

01:02:31.135 --> 01:02:32.775
But it's not blocked for you.

01:02:32.775 --> 01:02:35.875
Why do you want to go round and round again?

01:02:35.875 --> 01:02:37.975
But that is what today everybody wants to
do the same way.

01:02:37.975 --> 01:02:41.485
"We must sacrifice, we must give up this,
we must do that."

01:02:41.485 --> 01:02:42.955
What are you going to sacrifice?

01:02:42.955 --> 01:02:46.015
What is there to sacrifice?

01:02:46.015 --> 01:02:56.105
I would like to know in Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:56.105 --> 01:03:04.655
Of course, mostly people sacrifice their brains,
I think.

01:03:04.655 --> 01:03:12.655
(Laughter) When nothing is to be sacrificed,
why do you want to become a goat of sacrifice?

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:21.784
So from Buddha's life, you don't have to learn
that He went in the jungles and He went, He

01:03:21.784 --> 01:03:25.605
did this and He did also renunciation.

01:03:25.605 --> 01:03:28.355
He gave up his wife.

01:03:28.355 --> 01:03:29.355
No!

01:03:29.355 --> 01:03:36.985
That's not needed now, that's over.

01:03:36.985 --> 01:03:44.314
This is where we fail and we cannot explain
to people that those who say, "But we must

01:03:44.314 --> 01:03:45.445
have renunciation."

01:03:45.445 --> 01:03:51.285
Renunciation we have from within, like the
sand, as I told you.

01:03:51.285 --> 01:03:54.475
Detachment we have from within.

01:03:54.475 --> 01:04:03.085
But this is compassion, pure compassion is
the most detached thing.

01:04:03.085 --> 01:04:14.355
Is the most detached thing is the pure compassion,
or anything pure is pure because it is detached.

01:04:14.355 --> 01:04:18.165
It's a proper mathematics.

01:04:18.165 --> 01:04:20.605
Anything that is pure has to be detached.

01:04:20.605 --> 01:04:25.595
If it is attached it is contaminated.

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:26.775
See the logic.

01:04:26.775 --> 01:04:31.044
Absolute mathematics is there.

01:04:31.044 --> 01:04:34.505
If you have pure love then you are detached.

01:04:34.505 --> 01:04:38.995
Now supposing you love Mother - all right,
take that.

01:04:38.995 --> 01:04:47.215
Now you have say, pure love for Me, then you
won't get angry if I don't come to your house.

01:04:47.215 --> 01:04:51.705
You won't feel disappointed if I can't sit
in your car.

01:04:51.705 --> 01:04:56.485
You won't feel unhappy because I could not
touch your sari.

01:04:56.485 --> 01:04:58.935
Because, "I just love Mother, finished."

01:04:58.935 --> 01:05:01.575
It ends up there.

01:05:01.575 --> 01:05:04.215
Just pure love.

01:05:04.215 --> 01:05:09.185
Of course, I know these weaknesses, so I try
to please you, all right, all right.

01:05:09.185 --> 01:05:16.665
But actually, if you really love Me, "It's
all right, I love Her, and She loves me, finished.

01:05:16.665 --> 01:05:22.845
Whether She comes to my house or not, whether
She gives me a present or not, whether She

01:05:22.845 --> 01:05:28.925
pats me or not, whether I can see Her or not,
whether I can meet Her or not.

01:05:28.724 --> 01:05:30.814
Makes no difference, I love Her."

01:05:31.015 --> 01:05:32.755
That's the purity of love.

01:05:32.755 --> 01:05:39.365
Where there's no expectation of any kind,
except that I love and that love is the ocean

01:05:39.365 --> 01:05:46.115
of enjoyment and the ocean of bliss, finished.

01:05:46.115 --> 01:05:52.705
Is the easiest thing to do, is to love.

01:05:52.705 --> 01:05:57.315
Just love.

01:05:57.315 --> 01:06:05.355
How your heart increases like an ocean - I
just love.

01:06:05.355 --> 01:06:08.825
The sea is not attached to any shore.

01:06:08.825 --> 01:06:14.285
When it has to come, it comes out, when it
has to go back, it goes back.

01:06:14.285 --> 01:06:17.675
When it has to give water for the rain, it
gives.

01:06:17.675 --> 01:06:23.825
The water goes as the clouds are formed, then
the water falls as rain, again it comes back

01:06:23.825 --> 01:06:25.165
to the sea.

01:06:25.165 --> 01:06:29.465
It doesn't stop anywhere.

01:06:29.465 --> 01:06:38.185
In the same way, if we just think, "Is the feeling
I have that I love Mother.

01:06:38.185 --> 01:06:39.415
What a feeling it is."

01:06:39.415 --> 01:06:48.465
That should be the end of everything, absolutely.

01:06:48.465 --> 01:06:55.215
I feel the same way; otherwise I would be
feeling every day guilty, "Oh, I didn't smile

01:06:55.215 --> 01:06:58.465
at that, I didn't give a present to this one.

01:06:58.465 --> 01:07:02.185
I should have brought something special for
that person.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:04.185
I was late for the program."

01:07:04.185 --> 01:07:15.445
(Laughter) But I
don't feel guilty because it's all managed.

01:07:15.445 --> 01:07:21.145
If I had come earlier, all these hecklers
would have been there to trouble us.

01:07:21.145 --> 01:07:24.205
So all the horrible people disappeared and
we had the right people.

01:07:24.205 --> 01:07:27.355
Then I set down through.

01:07:27.355 --> 01:07:30.185
I didn't say, "I'm going back."

01:07:30.185 --> 01:07:31.225
There is no need to be nervous.

01:07:31.225 --> 01:07:36.115
If Mother is late, there must be some plan.

01:07:36.115 --> 01:07:39.235
If She is early, there must be some plan.

01:07:39.235 --> 01:07:44.985
If She's going by this plane and not by the
other, there must be some plan.

01:07:44.985 --> 01:07:47.034
Not to doubt it.

01:07:47.034 --> 01:07:49.655
If She's doing something, must be some plan.

01:07:49.655 --> 01:07:52.725
You know, Mother has Her own plans.

01:07:52.725 --> 01:07:55.945
Is a nice idea to think like that.

01:07:55.945 --> 01:08:00.495
"She has Her own plans, you know."

01:08:00.495 --> 01:08:08.685
Once you start feeling that way, such security
and such beautiful peace will spread in your

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:09.685
being.

01:08:09.685 --> 01:08:12.054
And you will be quite satisfied.

01:08:12.054 --> 01:08:16.175
Now, everybody brings food for Me, look at
that.

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:22.445
I mean, when I see that I get a fright, baba.

01:08:22.445 --> 01:08:27.675
(Laughter) I mean, look at that!

01:08:27.675 --> 01:08:35.285
I'm supposed to taste it, but even tasting
will be so much.

01:08:35.285 --> 01:08:43.925
(Laughter) But I've to eat, you know, because
if I don't touch one of them, then they will

01:08:43.925 --> 01:08:45.405
think, "Why didn't Mother touch?

01:08:45.405 --> 01:08:46.405
Must be something wrong."

01:08:46.405 --> 01:08:58.725
(Laughter) This is a very big problem for
Me, to keep you happy and to assure you.

01:08:58.725 --> 01:09:02.665
But I assure you that I love you all very
much!!

01:09:02.665 --> 01:09:07.814
Whether you bring food for Me, or flowers
for Me or anything.

01:09:07.814 --> 01:09:09.855
Does not matter.

01:09:09.654 --> 01:09:17.083
When I'm leaving Bogota, My heart is wrenching
out, I've seen the wrench of My heart, I've

01:09:17.284 --> 01:09:18.284
seen.

01:09:18.284 --> 01:09:22.205
Because I'm leaving all the new babes there,
that's all.

01:09:22.004 --> 01:09:28.974
Then I just don't want to face, I mean, the
thing, I feel, "Oh God, just see I'm leaving

01:09:29.175 --> 01:09:30.175
them."

01:09:30.175 --> 01:09:34.205
But, because I love them.

01:09:34.004 --> 01:09:42.294
So I see, because I love them I feel it, so
it's all right, even this pain is all right, because

01:09:42.495 --> 01:09:44.245
I love them.

01:09:44.245 --> 01:09:48.895
I enjoy that pain because I love them.

01:09:48.895 --> 01:09:52.665
And then I come here and see all of you standing
at the airport.

01:09:52.665 --> 01:09:55.415
Whole thing is fulfilled again.

01:09:55.415 --> 01:10:04.215
Just not because you have come - because I
have come to love you.

01:10:04.215 --> 01:10:10.135
All this is such a beautiful rapport and such
a beautiful feeling.

01:10:10.135 --> 01:10:16.935
I want you all to enjoy this and not petty
things and small things which spoil your joy.

01:10:16.935 --> 01:10:23.715
These are all joy killers and that's why the
greatest joy killer is the ego nonsensical,

01:10:23.715 --> 01:10:28.534
which tells you, "Oh, why didn't Mother do
this or do that?"

01:10:28.534 --> 01:10:30.695
It's the ego part of it.

01:10:30.695 --> 01:10:35.075
That's why we have to think of Buddha and
celebrate his Jayanti within ourselves to

01:10:35.075 --> 01:10:45.565
establish Him to say that, "This ego cannot
take away our joy."

01:10:45.565 --> 01:10:51.275
Anywhere such idea just comes into your head
tell them, "Now Mister ego, I know you very

01:10:51.275 --> 01:10:52.275
well!"

01:10:52.275 --> 01:10:58.415
(Laughter) In the light of Buddha you can
see your ego very clearly.

01:10:58.415 --> 01:11:02.314
And He's the killer of your ego, He's the
one who finishes off your ego.

01:11:02.314 --> 01:11:11.175
So today we have to pray for the whole of
America which is really suffering from this

01:11:11.175 --> 01:11:15.745
nonsensical, mythical ego, which is being
exploited by everyone.

01:11:15.745 --> 01:11:21.024
People are befooling them, the media is befooling,
all the doctors are befooling, all the psychologists

01:11:21.024 --> 01:11:25.165
are befooling, all the governments are befooling.

01:11:25.165 --> 01:11:29.325
I mean, I don't know, everybody is befooled,
because they've got ego.

01:11:29.325 --> 01:11:31.915
If they had no ego, they could not have been
befooled.

01:11:31.915 --> 01:11:40.145
All these advertisements and all this hocus-pocus
that's going on, is because human beings have

01:11:40.145 --> 01:11:44.304
ego and they can't see it.

01:11:44.304 --> 01:11:52.605
So we have to say, "Mother, please take away
this curse of ego from Americans and America."

01:11:52.605 --> 01:11:57.925
That's why it is nice today we have this Buddha
Puja.

01:11:57.925 --> 01:11:59.974
May God bless you!
