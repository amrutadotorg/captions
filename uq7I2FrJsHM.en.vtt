00:00.195 --> 00:04.075
Sant Eknath comes from Pratishthana.

00:04.075 --> 00:08.435
Pratishthana is called as Paithan.

00:09.695 --> 00:14.395
And he is the one, who has written this "Jogava",

00:14.855 --> 00:16.855
means the Yoga

00:17.995 --> 00:25.635
and at that time he sang this in a very village language

00:26.395 --> 00:29.955
and it is sung by so many people all over the Maharastra.

00:30.255 --> 00:34.555
You can imagine that this song was written so many years back .

00:34.555 --> 00:39.455
Now they have converted into a kind of a –

00:40.815 --> 00:42.835
I mean for Sahaja Yoga

00:42.835 --> 00:46.875
but it is a very -

00:48.555 --> 00:54.075
and actually, it is precisely described - what they wanted at that time.

00:54.795 --> 00:58.735
[Marathi]

00:58.735 --> 01:01.115
Now, in the beginning he says,

01:01.295 --> 01:05.275
the Goddess of Maharasthra was called as "Baya".

01:05.275 --> 01:08.795
You will be amazed, in my childhood my name was Baya.

01:08.795 --> 01:10.795
They used to call me in my family as Baya.

01:13.455 --> 01:20.835
So, he is saying that, "I will ask Mother to give me the Yoga".

01:22.835 --> 01:26.095
In the villages, this is said "Jog awa"

01:27.495 --> 01:30.135
Again, he says, "aicha Jogawa"

01:30.135 --> 01:33.615
means the "jogowa" from the Goddess Baya

01:33.615 --> 01:35.615
and he is asking the "jogowa".

01:37.435 --> 01:40.355
Now '"Anadi nirguni"

01:40.355 --> 01:43.875
the one which is primordial,

01:43.875 --> 01:46.335
"Adi" beyond guna,

01:46.735 --> 01:50.881
is the one which is without any gunas

01:50.881 --> 01:54.915
has manifested as "Bhawani" on this earth.

01:57.235 --> 02:01.595
And She has come to kill this Mahishasura.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.975
Also, she has come,

02:05.975 --> 02:08.475
"Prividh. Tapanzi Karavaya Zharani"

02:08.475 --> 02:10.475
[Marathi]

02:10.475 --> 02:12.475
Five types of-

02:12.475 --> 02:14.475
[Marathi]

02:14.475 --> 02:17.355
Pains. Only devils.

02:17.355 --> 02:19.355
Heating pains.

02:19.535 --> 02:22.315
Three types of heating pains

02:25.035 --> 02:31.835
"And now She is going to come for our 'Nirvana" that time he had said.

02:32.575 --> 02:38.355
He says that, "What I will I do when she will come for my Nirvana?"

02:39.095 --> 02:44.035
"This 'dvaita' I have got." Means I am thinking about myself separated from God.

02:44.095 --> 02:47.615
'Dvaita' is that you think this world is separate from God.

02:47.615 --> 02:51.475
"When we think that this is that way that
we are all one with God,

02:51.475 --> 02:54.655
then I will remove this dvaita

02:54.655 --> 02:59.575
and I will put a garland in her- I'll put a garland to her

02:59.715 --> 03:10.115
and in my hand I will take the flag of enlightened knowledge."

03:12.635 --> 03:14.955
It’s already described in this.

03:18.175 --> 03:30.055
"And without any discrimination about cast or religion or anything,

03:30.215 --> 03:33.335
I will go visit her".

03:35.535 --> 03:38.215
"Then what I will do?

03:38.215 --> 03:44.155
For nine days I will do nine types of Bhakti of this Goddess.

03:47.695 --> 03:56.135
And then I will give up all other asking or anything

03:56.475 --> 04:01.835
and I will ask for a son who is knowledge."

04:03.295 --> 04:07.774
"Then what will I do?" You see, the lady's singing, he sings like a lady.

04:07.775 --> 04:14.835
So, he says, "This world is full of ego". The 'dambha' is false pride.

04:16.115 --> 04:20.894
"So, I will give up that kind of a bad son".

04:20.895 --> 04:23.615
It's a bad son.

04:23.615 --> 04:27.535
"And what will I do in the paradi?"

04:27.535 --> 04:30.595
It’s the place in which you carry flowers for the God.

04:30.955 --> 04:34.415
"So, in that paradi [basket], I will put

04:34.755 --> 04:39.055
complete enlightened knowledge.

04:43.295 --> 04:47.755
And all the "Asha manishanchya", means all the desires

04:47.755 --> 04:49.755
and all the aspirations

04:50.655 --> 04:55.555
"I will finish them.

04:55.555 --> 04:58.835
[Marathi]

05:00.335 --> 05:02.335
Break them.

05:02.335 --> 05:04.015
"Completely break them".

05:04.195 --> 05:06.855
"Mano vikara karin. kurvandi".

05:06.855 --> 05:10.315
And all my "mano vikaras", you see all the mind

05:10.315 --> 05:12.315
which is so much conditioned

05:13.255 --> 05:18.715
[Marathi]

05:18.715 --> 05:21.995
"So, I 'll take it out and slappe it."

05:25.355 --> 05:29.135
"Amrut rasachi bharin mi duradi"

05:33.415 --> 05:35.415
'Duradi' is a basket

05:36.515 --> 05:40.015
"Basket I will be filling with the

05:40.015 --> 05:45.355
'Amrut rasa" that is the ambrosia.

05:47.715 --> 05:49.855
"Ata sazani". She is telling her friend,

05:49.855 --> 05:53.515
, "O my friend, now I have become completely detached,

05:53.515 --> 05:55.515
‘nihsang’,

05:55.515 --> 06:01.495
and my husband who was a doubtful, who was a doubt,

06:01.495 --> 06:03.495
my husband who was a doubt,

06:04.495 --> 06:08.655
I have given up living with that husband of mine",

06:08.655 --> 06:11.875
means the doubt has disappeared from me.

06:11.995 --> 06:16.535
And she says that,

06:16.535 --> 06:22.635
"The Kama and Krodha these are two 'mang"

06:22.635 --> 06:27.935
is the one, scheduled caste people who burn the bodies.

06:27.935 --> 06:29.575
"And I have given them up

06:29.575 --> 06:35.295
and what have I done? I’ve made my

06:35.295 --> 06:37.295
[Marathi]

06:37.295 --> 06:41.115
channel and opened out my tunnel.

06:41.115 --> 06:44.115
that is of Sushumna, you see now.

06:45.475 --> 06:51.555
"Such a Yoga I have asked and kept it with me.

06:52.255 --> 06:57.375
And when I got it, I went to the great door

06:57.375 --> 07:03.615
and I thanked the God Almighty

07:05.135 --> 07:10.575
and I have now come out of this life and death problems".

07:11.935 --> 07:16.155
At that time, he wrote all this and today you are getting all the results.

07:16.155 --> 07:22.035
Just that, so clearly and the lady singing this.

07:46.755 --> 07:48.755
Take some vow,

07:49.895 --> 07:55.215
something about yourself and about others.

07:59.775 --> 08:04.975
We have to remember one great thing,

08:05.595 --> 08:07.835
that we are Yogis now,

08:08.815 --> 08:11.615
that too we are Sahaja Yogis.

08:12.495 --> 08:18.835
And as Sahaja Yogis, we have to be 'par excellence'

08:21.475 --> 08:26.014
in our behaviour, in our temperament,

08:26.014 --> 08:30.894
in our dealing with others, in tackling any situation

08:30.894 --> 08:35.934
or getting any solution out of some problems

08:35.934 --> 08:38.975
You have to be balancing.

08:39.135 --> 08:45.895
Now some of you find that you have very good brain,

08:45.895 --> 08:51.675
I mean intelligent; but you lack in your heart.

08:52.375 --> 08:57.195
Some of you have got very large heart, but you lack in your brains.

08:58.935 --> 09:01.595
So, the balance must be brought.

09:03.735 --> 09:08.715
But the greatest knowledge, greatest of all the greatest knowledge is

09:08.715 --> 09:12.435
to know that God is love.

09:14.895 --> 09:19.595
He is love and if you cannot even love a Sahaja Yogi,

09:20.375 --> 09:24.215
then also you must know that there is something very wrong with you,

09:24.215 --> 09:26.215
which must go out.

09:28.175 --> 09:30.835
The love has to be there.

09:31.715 --> 09:34.835
And this love is what we call as 'Nirvajya'

09:34.895 --> 09:37.775
means there is no interest on you, just the capital,

09:38.715 --> 09:42.795
meaning you love each other in such a manner

09:44.655 --> 09:49.855
that you just give and don't expect anything.

09:50.095 --> 09:55.815
Just give and enjoyment of giving is the highest.

09:56.135 --> 09:58.355
I tell you from my experience.

09:58.355 --> 10:03.235
To me the greatest joy is when I can give Realisation,

10:07.415 --> 10:10.835
Second one is when I can give away things.

10:13.115 --> 10:16.935
Or the third one could be that I can give it to others.

10:17.735 --> 10:23.195
So now, as you are not the people who are sitting at the receiving end,

10:23.895 --> 10:26.435
but at the giving end

10:26.435 --> 10:30.435
you must know what you have given to others.

10:30.535 --> 10:33.575
On the contrary, even now, if you just give your tempers,

10:33.575 --> 10:38.095
you show your greed and all kinds of things

10:38.095 --> 10:41.515
that does not behoove a Sahaja Yogi,

10:42.015 --> 10:47.054
then you have to know there's something
still left behind.

10:47.055 --> 10:52.815
Or else if you are so particular about small things like clothes

10:53.535 --> 10:56.275
like food, like comforts

10:56.415 --> 11:00.655
then know that there is something is missing, the personality is not full.

11:03.135 --> 11:06.915
And also remember one sentence always,

11:06.915 --> 11:12.255
"Ask a question to yourself: have I fulfilled my destiny?".

11:14.655 --> 11:18.055
This is one question you should ask,

11:18.055 --> 11:21.035
"Have I fulfilled my destiny?"

11:21.035 --> 11:24.335
And that will clarify the situation for you

11:24.335 --> 11:26.335
because now you are a guru of your own,

11:26.415 --> 11:28.415
you know you understand.

11:28.495 --> 11:32.255
You know so much about Sahaja Yoga mentally.

11:32.255 --> 11:34.995
But when it penetrates into your being

11:34.995 --> 11:39.455
and the whole knowledge becomes a part and parcel of your being

11:39.455 --> 11:42.814
then it's a very different thing.

11:44.655 --> 11:53.055
The whole attitude about facing anything is very different for a Realised soul

11:54.455 --> 11:59.635
Like me, I would say, if I see a problem,

11:59.935 --> 12:03.455
immediately I go into meditation, immediately,

12:07.695 --> 12:09.635
and the problem is solved.

12:09.635 --> 12:11.635
Because that’s my power.

12:11.855 --> 12:16.575
In the same way if you see a problem and
if you go into meditation

12:16.575 --> 12:19.875
the problem will be solved by me.

12:20.715 --> 12:24.555
That means in meditation you surrender to me, then it’s my job.

12:27.615 --> 12:34.655
But if you start solving it mentally or orally, you will fall into traps.

12:34.655 --> 12:38.494
The best thing is any such problem that
bothers you,

12:38.495 --> 12:40.955
you should just go into meditation,

12:41.175 --> 12:46.135
don't have to even pray just go into meditation with that problem

12:46.515 --> 12:48.835
and you will come out victorious.

12:49.955 --> 12:52.815
What today you have been asking me for the victory,

12:52.815 --> 12:57.355
I have to tell you that you are very safe in the fort

12:57.355 --> 13:00.375
of your meditative state.

13:01.195 --> 13:04.655
And when you are in meditation only you can grow.

13:04.655 --> 13:07.775
You cannot grow otherwise.

13:07.775 --> 13:11.655
It's like the sunshine for any tree

13:12.335 --> 13:16.175
So, you have to be in meditation, in Nirvichara.

13:16.175 --> 13:19.315
You don’t have to oppose anybody, you don’t have to aggress anybody,

13:19.315 --> 13:21.795
you don’t have to say anything.

13:22.575 --> 13:27.335
Specially for other Sahaja Yogis, you don’t have to worry.

13:27.615 --> 13:32.155
Anybody whom you find to be funny,

13:32.155 --> 13:34.155
just go into meditation.

13:35.935 --> 13:41.215
And you will be amazed how things will change, that is your power

13:41.215 --> 13:45.375
How many people have got Realisation in this world?

13:45.375 --> 13:47.255
Very few.

13:47.255 --> 13:51.315
They are growing up, all right, they are working it out.

13:51.315 --> 13:55.155
But what is lacking in them is the Meditative Force.

13:55.695 --> 13:57.555
The best way is to surrender.

13:57.555 --> 13:59.555
And the surrendering is easier,

13:59.635 --> 14:02.975
you just put me in your heart all the time

14:02.975 --> 14:04.975
the simplest way.

14:06.735 --> 14:11.755
Then you cannot live without it

14:11.755 --> 14:14.635
You cannot exist without it.

14:14.735 --> 14:20.655
You feel completely lost. It’s a kind of a very detached love.

14:20.655 --> 14:25.895
You just feel absolutely rested, blissful, and content.

14:25.895 --> 14:27.934
Then  you don't want anything,

14:27.934 --> 14:31.054
you don't need anything.

14:31.615 --> 14:34.515
That is the state one has to establish.

14:34.515 --> 14:38.455
It’s so easy for you because I am in person here.

14:38.455 --> 14:42.155
Only problem that is there, as I told you, in Sahaja Yoga,

14:42.155 --> 14:45.075
that you have to recognize me to begin with.

14:45.435 --> 14:49.375
But to recognize me is rather difficult ecause I am a Mahamaya.

14:50.695 --> 15:00.035
And so normally you might come into that mess created by the Mahamaya.

15:00.335 --> 15:05.215
But as I told you, the other day, that you could not have faced me in my

15:05.215 --> 15:06.555
other forms

15:06.555 --> 15:10.215
Imagine a person with a sword in the hand sitting on a lion!

15:10.335 --> 15:13.695
You could not have faced it. So, I had to be Mahamaya.

15:13.695 --> 15:17.215
And this is what it is, that in this form,

15:17.215 --> 15:20.254
you can come close to me,  you can talk to me

15:20.255 --> 15:22.495
you can tell me your problems,

15:22.495 --> 15:28.295
you can also take my advice, if you want.

15:28.495 --> 15:30.835
So, this counselling can be done better.

15:30.835 --> 15:32.655
I could decode everything to you.

15:32.655 --> 15:36.495
I could tell everything about it.

15:36.495 --> 15:43.395
But to know that you are sitting before Mahamaya,

15:45.975 --> 15:48.255
itself is very helpful.

15:49.595 --> 15:55.095
So, don't get lost into the garb of Mahamaya.

15:57.135 --> 16:02.395
In your protocol, in your understanding, in everything

16:02.915 --> 16:07.035
you have to remember that we should not make mistakes

16:08.075 --> 16:13.375
or we should try to surrender, to be surrendered.

16:14.055 --> 16:18.015
Automatically you will learn everything automatically.

16:19.215 --> 16:22.254
There's nothing to be taught to you.

16:22.415 --> 16:27.374
That state is such - like a tree when it comes to its full bloom

16:27.375 --> 16:28.935
it gives flowers.

16:29.195 --> 16:32.175
And the flower comes to its own maturity,

16:32.175 --> 16:33.955
it gives fruits.

16:33.955 --> 16:37.055
That is how you are built in, that is how you grow.

16:37.055 --> 16:39.235
When that happens,

16:39.695 --> 16:42.895
you yourself feel your own growth and enjoy it

16:42.895 --> 16:45.315
and just live happily with it.

16:45.315 --> 16:52.555
So, ultimately my destiny is one that I should make you all very happy and joyous.

16:52.555 --> 16:54.155
That's my destiny.

16:54.195 --> 16:56.815
That is why all this struggle is going on.

16:56.995 --> 17:00.435
I hope I fulfilled my destiny and your destiny too.

17:00.935 --> 17:02.575
May God bless you.
