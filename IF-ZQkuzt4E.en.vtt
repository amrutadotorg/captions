00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:07.320
I'm very happy that so many people have been able to come down.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.360
It's really a joyous moment to see so many people from Melbourne are here

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.400
to establish their realization.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.720
There are three types of people who

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.720
come to seeking.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.320
The lowest type are the ones who have some sort of physical ailments

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.800
or some torture some diseases or who are on the verge of dying or something like that, an emergency

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.220
in their mind so they come to sahaja yoga.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:57.600
All right, even if they come, they can be helped - that's not our top priority.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:07.840
Then there are second type of sahaja yogies or we can say the people who come to sahaja yoga

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.300
are the people who are seeking other things in life

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.320
like jobs, money, this, that all nonsensical things.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:24.700
But, among them there are some people

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.720
who want to know the cause of the problem why they are like that.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:38.500
The third type are the people who can be divided into two

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:46.320
one the type that seeks balance, dharma, righteousness

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:52.640
because they find in the world people are so horrible,

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.200
so mischievous, so dangerous, so restless

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.400
- they get worried about all the worldly

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:11.840
turmoils that are on, they get shocked

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.380
and then they want to find a solution why have I come on this earth?

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.740
This is one type as we call bahirmukhis -

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.280
the ones, whose attention is outside but in a very subtler way, in a very Divine way.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:37.480
The second ones, in the same category, are the ones who are seekers

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.800
who have been seeking in ages. They have been seeking in many lives

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:52.020
they have been seekers of truth. They have been on hills and dales - Himalayas, everywhere -

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.600
have done everything else and now born again here to be, to be able to find out the truth.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.520
These are called as Antarmukhis - these are the people who are

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:16.260
inward. So the first priority we have to have

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:21.240
of the third category, both the types are equally important.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.940
But after becoming realized, when you get your realization, then you achieve both the qualities simultaneously.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.720
You become a yogi inside and connected with the whole world.

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:43.620
Your attention starts going outward because first the light is to be enlightened

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.280
and the when light is enlightened, it gives the light.

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.500
Now this Kundalini, the force within you, as is said, is pure desire.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.940
It's not only pure desire but it is a purification desire.

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.760
It has a power to purify - tremendous power it is.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.580
And this Kundalini thinks, organizes,

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:23.680
knows, co-ordinates, blesses and ultimately guides.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.260
So to go beyond the cause

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.240
we must understand that this Kundalini is the pure form.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.520
That means it is detached. Anything that gets attached is not pure.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.680
Anything that gets spoilt is not pure.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.160
What we say gold is pure because it is untarnishable -

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.980
untarnishable, that's the quality of gold. So it is immaculate.

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:15.620
It cannot be ruined, spoiled by anything except that

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.060
there could be khand, as they call it, could be broken in between and thus weak.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.420
So now, something that has a purifying quality like a

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:36.060
purifying agent, say, take a simple thing like soap. So the soap,

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:43.120
wherever you apply, will clean. Kundalini wherever it will go it will clean, it will nourish.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:51.800
This is one quality that we must understand that it is not tarnishable, it cannot be spoiled,

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:58.500
it cannot be ruined, moreover it cleanses, it nourishes

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.100
but because it thinks, it knows how to nourish you up to what point

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.580
how to go, how far to go or it stops.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.980
But thinking is not vocal, it doesn't say anything

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.420
but when it goes round these chakras it makes a sound.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.660
And these sounds are made because the movement

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.680
of Kundalini through these chakras creates

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.520
a non- percussion sound pass through these

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.680
creating sounds and these sounds are then

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:48.920
jotted down or heard by great saints and used in the phonetic language of Sanskrit.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.260
That's why Sanskrit is supposed to be the purest language.

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:58.000
But you need not know Sanskrit now - there's no need

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.800
because the deities know that you don't know the Sanskrit language.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:13.900
Now, this purifying fire within you or the purifying force within you or the power within you

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:21.580
goes and first of all enlightens our attention which is in this part

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.000
as you see the green part - this is the attention is.

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:29.200
But the movement of attention then starts moving in all directions.

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:34.620
Now when your  attention is enlightened what we call we become collectively conscious.

00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:39.620
But still how do you go beyond cause and effect is the point?

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:48.000
Now, this Kundalini being pure no cause can be attached to it - no cause, whatsoever.

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:53.520
So, if you can enter into the Kundalini on the principle of it

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.540
no cause can get attached to it.

00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:02.320
That's how you go beyond cause and effect.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:07.640
But how do you enter into the Kundalini, that's the main point?

00:08:07.860 --> 00:08:14.820
Main problem is how do we enter into the Kundalini? Supposing you are paying attention to Me and I say pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

00:08:16.340 --> 00:08:21.760
Even if Kundalini rises your attention is attracted inside still you cannot pay attention inside.

00:08:22.220 --> 00:08:28.040
So how do you pay attention inside is through this enlightened attention.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:35.260
This attention which is enlightened has a power to take your attention inside

00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:43.940
to the Kundalini and that's how you enter into the realm which is detached - that [UNCLEAR -LIKE?] fortress.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:52.220
Nobody can enter in there. So, when you're in thoughtless awareness, when you're not thinking, you are in your fortress no body can

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:56.300
jump at you, nobody can trouble you - all the causes drop off.

00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:01.960
That is why it is necessary first to practice to be in that thoughtless awareness

00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:08.220
through the practice of sahaja yoga to begin with so that you learn how to enter into that state -

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:14.700
how to enter into that state. But first and foremost thing is that your Kundalini must be awakened,

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:20.440
then it must be allowed to move properly - you must co-operate, you must know how to do it

00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.720
and raise it so that you keep it

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.820
at least if not above, at least in the brain.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:37.600
But best thing is if it comes out then you have no tensions, no worries

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:43.980
because everything that you have passes into your attention,

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:48.000
attention touches the Kundalini because you are a realized soul

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:55.720
and leaves it in the force of the Kundalini, in the current of Kundalini

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:01.860
and this current takes away everything that is out and that's how you are cleared away.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:08.980
This is a very, very simple way of explaining how you go beyond cause and effect.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:14.580
And this is what happens but for that it is necessary that you must learn

00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:20.100
how to enter into your Kundalini, how to keep your attention

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:28.400
enlightened. Now it's very easy - your attention gets involved in to anything through your thoughts.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.680
Because when your consciousness entered into you -

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:38.560
- being the prismatic brain - like a prism - your attention has gone out.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:44.740
Now, to keep this attention detached you have to make it a pure attention.

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.320
to begin with you must try to put attention inside

00:10:50.620 --> 00:10:55.100
to be a witness, try to be a witness. But how, how will you know that you are a witness?

00:10:55.540 --> 00:11:00.320
You have to be in thoughtless awareness. When you are in thoughtless awareness

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:05.020
then what happens that you're detached, you're seeing everything.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.580
There're many people who talk about thoughtless awareness - you'll be surprised - I've heard some gurus -

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.300
they might have, I don't know because I went to America long time back

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.820
and they must have recorded it or whatever it is, they talk of it

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:25.560
but there isn't anything way of doing it. Kundalini is the only way you can go into thoughtless awareness your attention can go.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:31.740
So, these people are also using words of sahaja yoga, I've seen that,

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.260
has no meaning because they cannot reach the Kundalini but

00:11:35.540 --> 00:11:41.920
there makes no difference because now you have become your own guru and you find out for yourself. So, throw away all these

00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:48.280
fake gurus away from you. The problems, the barriers, the worst of all

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:56.160
in sahaja yoga comes from people who have been to other gurus - it's a headache, I tell you, for you and for us.

00:11:56.760 --> 00:12:03.080
First of all that you should realize that whatever you have been doing with other gurus has been all false and fake, is difficult

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:06.240
because you're so conditioned - I must tell you very frankly.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:10.500
So, the growth doesn't take place because you have to become the guru.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:17.060
You cannot depend on anybody as guru but you have to become the guru. I can only guide you as a Mother, I can only tell you what it is,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:23.160
I can only take your Kundalini there but it is you who has to become. Like I would say, I can cook for you

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:27.900
but you have to eat and you have to enjoy the taste of it - I can't enjoy for you.

00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:35.880
So then, you have to give up those things which you have been following which are wrong.

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:41.220
There may be some guru who might have been a good guru but I don't think anybody has come on the Western side.

00:12:41.460 --> 00:12:47.400
I haven't known of anyone who has come on the Western side because I sent one fellow, he ran away in three days from New York.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:52.860
He wouldn't settle down there, he ran up to the Himalayas and he said, " I don't want to come, Mother, don't send me anywhere."

00:12:53.160 --> 00:13:00.860
He couldn't bear the people, he didn't have the patience [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. So,

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:06.780
though they did not crucify him [WISELY OR FIRSTLY?] he ran away, you see [SHRI  MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:13.200
He said, " Whatever you may say, Mother I cannot face these people are terrible. They are just Dollars, nothing else but moving Dollars."

00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.440
[ALL LAUGH]

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.620
All right, so, with this kind of barrier it's very difficult to convince people.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:30.520
Still they'll go on fighting, "This my guru says so, my guru..." Then you go to your guru is the best way we take it because how can we go on convincing.

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:36.140
You also get a headache, you see, if you take some horrible guru's name you get a headache - really, you get a catch.

00:13:36.460 --> 00:13:42.760
You get a catch on this finger, you get a catch on this finger, you get catch everywhere, so you don't want to hear about any guru.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:47.220
Even discussing these gurus you feel terrible - so disgusting.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:53.220
Whether fake, horrible, money makers, you don't know when you see them you don't know whether to laugh or to cry -

00:13:53.900 --> 00:13:59.480
- this is the situation. So, best is to find out for yourself

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:03.960
if you're willing to give up the gurus then only trouble the sahaja yogies - you see, they get fed up with it.

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:10.020
They don't want to fight that. Now, even if you want to give up they won't give you up because they have possessed you.

00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:18.800
They're like leeches, you see, so, you still have catches of the guru. This is the worst catch that we have so far seen.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:25.220
Now in the beginning of course, they had patience but now, I think, they have exhausted the patience

00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:30.360
so, when yesterday I told them there were lots of people in Melbourne, I think, lot of people will come to sahaja yogies

00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:36.720
But they asked Me one question, "But how many from other gurus, God alone knows," - because it's a big headache.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:44.120
So, I would request you to put your guru on somewhere else and come here and see that you become the
guru to understand that another fellow.

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:53.480
And then when they discover about the guru they go on saying, "That chap, that guy"

00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:59.260
and all kinds of things they say about him but before that they'll fight for that guru.

00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:04.060
So, that is one thing you must understand that don't play into the hands of these

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:10.820
people because, " I paid for it Mother, I paid six thousand pounds." All right, so what, must you have more of that?

00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:17.100
Because they suffer, they have Epilepsies, they have all kinds of problems. We've had people of gurus who had Epilepsies.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:22.220
Horrible! This is TM people having Epilepsies - I've cured so many of them, I openly say that.

00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:28.320
Some doctor, is Dr. Frenic, he's publishing article about it - nobody listens.

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:34.320
There's a competition going on like a horse racing, "Oh, have you been to TM?" "No, it's expensive. All right I'll try that."

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.660
There's a sale on - Guru shopping sale.

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:42.440
So, there's a competition [UNCLEAR - SETTING OR SET IN?]. "Have you been to that sale, have you been to that sale?"

00:15:42.740 --> 00:15:47.960
It's like that. So, you must know it's frivolous, it's cheapish, it's useless.

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:54.760
Come to the,  "Brass Tacks'," the Americans say. Come to reality

00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.160
and see for yourself that these are all fake things, this is not the way you can raise the Kundalini.

00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:05.740
The greatest criteria, of course, is money but another one is that

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.720
that whatever they tell you you can do it yourself. Why do you need a guru for that?

00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:13.340
Like somebody said, " My guru gave me a name."  I mean anybody can give you a name,.

00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:16.700
you can give yourself a name, whatever you want. Why do you need a guru for that?

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:24.640
Or, "He gave me these clothes or he gave me this mala or he made me jump or he made me take out the clothes

00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:29.780
or somebody, you see, another fellow is eh... giving me drugs,

00:16:30.100 --> 00:16:36.780
third person allows me to do that."  I mean, as if these gurus allow you, you think that God will allow you also?

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.440
"He allows us to have mass sex, so he's a very good guru because he allows us."

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:49.500
Why don't you go to some other places where you can do it without taking an allowance and payment to the guru?

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:57.280
But the guru is waiting in the Hell and you will be there soon. This is fact.

00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.400
So, don't go after such horrible gurus who teach you all wrong things.

00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.920
Now, what is it, is that we, as soon as we get our realization

00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:14.460
we also realize about ourselves that, "This part of ours is lost, that part of ours is lost, this is not there,"

00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.720
we realize and when we realize that we don't mind correcting it because we see ourselves.

00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:25.760
We don't have to ask anybody we just see this thing within us happening. We see this part is not there,

00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:33.280
our attention is not all right, we cannot concentrate on anything. We understand so many things about ourselves after realization.

00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:39.860
Now, for that, supposing Mr. X has some problem - he tries to solve his problem, he cannot

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.240
because he has his own problem so he comes to the collective, he comes to the whole

00:17:45.420 --> 00:17:50.980
then what happens somebody else has got that point stronger and some other point weaker

00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:56.900
as a result the strength of one person helps  another person's weakness to be cured.

00:17:57.180 --> 00:18:03.620
And that's how there is a mutual curing system process which builds in and that's how people get

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:08.480
themselves all right perfected. And that is why it's a collective happening.

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:15.040
And when you become collective, you'll be surprised your heart opens out and you're amazed that human beings are so good,

00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:22.300
so beautiful, they're all such beautiful creation of God. You start enjoying each other really feeling the expansion of your being -

00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:26.200
that you are the other, that they are you. Such a great feeling!

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.860
I don't know if you can feel it at this stage or not but just to think they are all yours

00:18:31.580 --> 00:18:38.660
and you are theirs - no problem remains between relationships, nothing. No, no problems of any kind.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:44.780
But also no problems that would affect you remains because everybody's there to fight for you,

00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:50.900
to work for you, to help you out. It's very surprising how it works out. Even relations

00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:58.160
of sahaja yogies are helped so much that they're amazed how so many come forward to help.

00:18:58.420 --> 00:19:03.580
Normally people gather only for festivals or good things but when there is difficulty nobody gathers.

00:19:03.780 --> 00:19:09.280
And this is something great about sahaja yogies that when there is a difficulty in a sahaja yogi -

00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:16.080
supposing, a sahaja yogi has a mother who's sick and she's not a sahaja yogini, they'll go and help her.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:23.220
But she has to be a relation, somebody close to the sahaja yogi. The attention has to be there that a sahaja yogi

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:29.420
is there in trouble we must help our brother. You really become pure brothers and sisters after coming to sahaja yoga.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:37.980
This is what happens very easily to you so you must be collective being. That's how you start correcting each other.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:46.360
Also you develop all the knowledge, everything about sahaja yoga you understand - it's very knowledgeable.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.260
Because once you know all about it you're amazed. There are people who have never spoken in the public

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:58.660
I find, after realization, after a month they're great speakers - suddenly you see them - can't believe it.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:05.700
The other day, I was in a village travelling by a bullock-cart and the bullock-cart driver - I talked to him and I said, 'What

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:11.480
this is Nanaka or is it Kabira speaking!' Such a great saintly sayings -

00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:17.020
I was amazed. I said, 'From where did you get it?' He said, "Mother, from you." I said, 'From Me? I'm quite amazed,

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.420
it's coming from where?' He said, "It's all coming from my brain only."

00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:27.340
So, your brain gets that kind of an enlightenment - not that you become a saint you talk like a saint, you walk like a saint,

00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:34.420
all your behavior is saintly. Nobody has to tell you - just become. The whole countenance, temperament,

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:42.280
the stateliness all comes to you once for all. It's beautiful! Sacrifice doesn't become a sacrifice anymore, it's joy.

00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:47.700
Sacrifice means a joyous thing that you should be able to sacrifice. But that doesn't mean you give

00:20:47.940 --> 00:20:52.420
all your money to your guru or something like that - never. Sacrifice doesn't mean that nonsense.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:57.240
So, you don't give. What you give is the sacrifice of the time.

00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:03.340
You have to sacrifice so-called time that is so important to you. Like these days people have watches.

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:10.880
In modern times people have watches - they must see watch, they must know about time - saving time, saving time, saving time for what?

00:21:11.260 --> 00:21:16.780
For spending in your meditation, spending in doing God's work - it is for that.

00:21:17.060 --> 00:21:20.680
People are unemployed for doing God's work - simple as that. .

00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:25.400
If you get unemployed, you do God's work and you get employment as well as do God's work.

00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:32.820
In London which is, I mean England is you know, full of unemployment but not a single sahaja yogi is unemployed

00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:38.520
and he's also doing God's work. And God's work is nothing to be done much, nothing to be done much

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:42.100
but to be one with God is the point. If you're one with God -

00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:47.740
[UNCLEAR - BUT?] then the work is done by God. Now what is it doing? This is doing nothing. It's just in between

00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:54.760
but it is doing a work. If it is not there, you may not hear Me. So, in a way it is doing the work but it is not doing - it is a hollow thing.

00:21:54.980 --> 00:22:02.040
That's how you become hollow personality and you start working for God - it's so enjoyable, life is so enjoyable.

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:07.660
Life is for you for enjoyment and not for becoming miserable or unhappy.

00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:14.900
But you become, first of all you have to become that. Unless and until you become that all My promises are false. To become

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.440
is a desire must come from you - we cannot force you - I've told you many a times.

00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:24.400
And again I request you, the desire has to pulled up. Because of your conditionings,

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:29.460
because of other lethargies that you have, because of many other books you have read

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:36.140
or maybe I don't know what you have done but some people are really lethargic towards their ascent, they're really very sluggish.

00:22:36.340 --> 00:22:40.340
That's how they do not rise while some people rise very fast

00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:46.620
and they come up very fast and they do very well. So, one has to take advantage of the time.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:52.160
so that you are used for the rest of the world and that you're helpful to everyone.

00:22:52.380 --> 00:22:59.600
Sahaja yoga is not for one person. It is for the whole society, for the whole world and for the emancipation of humanity.

00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:07.140
This is what is already described in so many books, in scriptures but for that you are chosen,

00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:13.400
you are the one who's doing it. So, understand your own responsibility, understand your own powers

00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:20.740
and don't come now for, "Treat me this and Mother treat me for that. My mother's, mother's father's uncle's this thing

00:23:20.980 --> 00:23:26.720
is sick there." Don't worry on this point. First you get all right - get all right means you meditate.

00:23:26.980 --> 00:23:30.680
Now those who are sick here need not come out with their sickness at all.

00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:35.820
They will be told how to get their sickness all right. They themselves can treat it - I don't have to treat you.

00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.860
But once you are treated keep to certain limits. If you go beyond limits then you're caught up.

00:23:41.200 --> 00:23:48.320
Say you are in the limit of this hall, you're sitting here and there are all negativities all around, all right.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:55.000
Now, if you leave this, you catch it. So, keep your limits. not that you become a sort of a rabid

00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.220
sahaja yogi - not, doesn't mean that, but keep your limits, [UNCLEAR] don't do wrong things.

00:23:59.580 --> 00:24:05.220
As I told you, there was a fellow, who was suffering from AIDS, was cured by sahaja yoga - actually I never touched him.

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:12.880
But he did come to see Me, that's all - was sitting with a hands towards Me, My photograph and all that. He was completely cured but again he did the same thing.

00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:18.640
He didn't do any work for sahaja yoga, in the sense he never came to see people, nothing of the kind - again he got it.

00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:23.880
There are many people who got realization and then they get cancer. So they said, "Mother, how did we get cancer?"

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.840
Because you never tried to look after your self.

00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:36.760
So, you're just the same and you're not helped nor - sometimes you can be even worse, you see, because the Divine doesn't like this.

00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:43.920
It has spent some time on you, it has worked on you - it's not easy to raise the Kundalini of so many people with such complications.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.820
It's like a mountain you have to raise - you get so tired sometimes. So, one has to understand

00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:54.620
that somebody who respects our personality, respects our ascent, loves us so much

00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:58.820
we should also show some interest in ourselves. So, that is the wisdom

00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.860
one has to have and one has to work hard because you are all sages of the ancient times you're not sages today.

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:09.620
Only thing God of men have to become prophets and have to give

00:25:10.220 --> 00:25:15.420
realizations to others so that they become prophets as said by William Blake.

00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:21.160
Now, I think, today I've spoken quite a lot. I would like to have some questions from the new people

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:27.380
but sensible questions not aggressive questions because this place is not for aggression - is for love.

00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:30.540
May God bless you!

00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:38.100
Any questions?

00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:44.460
[INAUDIBLE]
- Yes, yes I'll pass it on to Her.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:50.060
- Can any mentally ill person be helped?
- Can a mentally ill person be helped?

00:25:50.300 --> 00:25:55.020
Again, you will start making list of all kinds of patients of the world.

00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:01.520
It's typical. When you come to sahaja yoga think of yourself. Do you think are you all right - you're not.

00:26:03.380 --> 00:26:09.660
See, we're not to open a hospital - that's one thing. Of course mentally, can be all right - retarded.

00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:14.600
But first you be all right. First you pay attention to yourself - that's the point I'm trying to make.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:21.860
Do you see? Don't miss the point. First you get well yourself, you become equipped then you can cure a mental

00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:25.760
equipped person, mentally retarded person - now how?

00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:33.440
Our attitude is like this, you see, that we have somebody in mind

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:41.420
say, somebody very close my child or someone - [UNCLEAR] so we come to sahaja yoga

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:49.780
So we think that, "Will the mentally be this thing, then I will get my ascent - if the child could be cured."

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.840
Now, the child is sick all right but you are all right. It's your life that's important.

00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.840
First see that you get to it and then you cure your child.

00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:06.340
But if you come in a circuitous way, Divine also finds devious ways of running away from you.

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:10.760
Take a straightforward thing - I want realization for myself.

00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:15.280
How many children we have had in previous lives, how many husbands, how many wives?

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:19.420
Why worry about these? First of all worry about yourself, "What am I?"

00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:27.340
But when, you'll be surprised, when you become established yourself, you become the citizen

00:27:27.540 --> 00:27:33.200
and your dependents are looked after by Divine, no doubt, they are looked after, they're blessed by the Divine.

00:27:33.300 --> 00:27:37.540
Is a fact you will see yourself but first of all you enter into it.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:44.880
So, don't worry about all kinds of problems and things I tell you 99% diseases can be cured, 99%

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:50.000
But that's not important - just now, you should be all right, you should be the light, all right.

00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:58.860
-Yes.
- Can I ask a personal question about myself [UNCLEAR] and I have  a

00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:07.000
nerve pinched on the [UNCLEAR] of the skull [UNCLEAR] going down

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:12.080
the neck one to the arm and [UNCLEAR] to the hand

00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:16.760
therefore is making the hand tremor. Tremors can be cured?

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:20.840
Yes, it can be. All right, done.

00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:27.220
[LAUGHTER] It can be but you have to come here to know how to get yourself cured.

00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:32.180
As you go to a doctor you come here and whatever they say you do it - it can be cured.

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:37.680
It has been cured, it will be cured so you just don't have to worry, it can be done

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:43.540
but it does not mean that you come for that. Your Kundalini has to be raised and then the Kundalini will do it.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:47.760
So you come here as you go to any doctor. Now the trouble is

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.120
when they go to a doctor they pay so much money - I'm just telling a general, not for you but general -

00:28:52.560 --> 00:28:57.100
they'll have to wait outside, for three hours they'll wait there, pay the doctor

00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:02.360
but here, if they have to wait even for five minutes, they start shouting. See you have no right

00:29:02.940 --> 00:29:09.320
that you should ask for the blessings but it is the Grace of God that it is going to bless you, all right.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:15.100
So, come with a humble mind that you should be cured and it can be easily cured. What else?

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:20.100
Can anyone [UNCLEAR] ?

00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:23.720
Can anyone be realized without knowing about Kundalini?

00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.100
About mentally need not know much, it can be realized, of course you can be.

00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:34.980
But, then you have to tell them what it is, this thing is better to do that way.

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.400
But there will be very few who will accept such a situation because they want to know about everything.

00:29:40.760 --> 00:29:47.700
But they need not know all that, you can little bit say, tell them that there is a way of getting realization

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:53.120
and then it's like this that when you come to Me, you want to have the lights, I'll say all right,

00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:58.140
go there's a switch you put on and you put on the switch, you get the lights without telling about it.

00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:04.780
But you would like to know how this light is done and then that helps you to create other lights.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:10.780
That's why, it is important to know about Kundalini. I would, I can do it without telling you anything

00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:16.260
about Kundalini, I can raise your Kundalini but you would not know anything about and you would not know what it is

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:21.360
It has happened with many who were born realized - they did not know they were realized souls

00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:25.660
and they got lost. Like I would say, greatest example, Leonardo da Vinci.

00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:32.000
Leonardo da Vinci  was a realized soul  and he got lost because he didn't know he was a

00:30:32.220 --> 00:30:37.240
realized soul, he was a higher personality than others, he got lost. So many got lost like that.

00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:46.600
Excuse me, if your Kundalini was arisen and that happened to be lost, I mean, you have it and it happened to be lost

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:50.200
How can you get lost if the Kundalini has been awakened?

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:56.820
It is, because, you see, it is, you're not yet fully developed matured person.

00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:04.180
When you are in an immature state it does happen. Kundalini is, when it rises, you'll be surprised, in some people it is just a wee bit,

00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:09.440
just like a hair, just comes up a little bit because it's so difficult, you see, the passage is so blocked

00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:16.580
so a little bit comes up. This is what it is. It is, a complete realization takes place only when you are Nirvikalpa samadhi -

00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:21.200
- that's a higher state. So in the beginning it's just a little wee bit opens up and

00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:29.180
one percent people do get lost, they do, because they have egos, they have superegos or all kinds of things - they do get lost - so be careful.

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:36.200
- Whatever is the fact.
- Can we all become fully realized in this life?

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.660
I wish everybody could but how many would be there - see in Melbourne how many people there are

00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:44.100
but how many come to the program and how many come here.

00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:49.320
- In this lifetime
- Can it be done in this life?
- Of course can be done but

00:31:49.520 --> 00:31:53.540
without their knowledge to give them realization is not possible. They have to know it

00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:58.440
that they are in for realization, they have to ask for it  - you cannot mesmerize.

00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.060
You have to tell them this is , I'm going to give you realization - this you have to tell them -

00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.080
you have to take their permission, cannot just do without their permission -

00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:12.800
But he's saying can we achieve it.  Once we get the hair's breadth can it be something that we could ...[INAUDIBLE]

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:19.760
Oh I see, you're saying, yes of course, of course that's what I'm saying, doesn't matter hair's breadth. In some people it is hair breadth

00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:26.980
in some people it's quite a lot. It can, everybody can achieve it, no doubt that's what I'm saying but in the beginning sometimes it can be

00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:31.800
very small and then people lose it. See now, yesterday

00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:39.060
at least I think, at least two hundred people got realization, at least two hundred, out of which about hundred are here.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:45.720
So you can imagine how they get lost, you see. You see they, they want some sort of a circus

00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:50.060
some sort of a nonsense before them - they're used to that na.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:57.420
They got realization - no doubt they got it - but no they didn't come. Hmm..

00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:07.380
- Now, what is it?
- I was at your tonight when I got realization but

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:12.200
when I was born on the family of my mother, I was born a clairvoyant

00:33:12.580 --> 00:33:18.340
- Boy, what?
- He was born a clairvoyant. He said he felt his realization the other night

00:33:18.560 --> 00:33:22.340
- I [UNCLEAR] want to be a clairvoyant
- He doesn't want to be a clairvoyant

00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:31.260
[LAUGHTER N CLAPS]

00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:35.580
You see, clairvoyant is also two types of things -

00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:41.740
you see, there's one who could be a realized soul, born realized soul. He's not clairvoyant but

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:47.620
such a person can heal, such a person knows more than other's know, can be more creative,

00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:54.240
may be more successful. So many things are there with a person who is a born realized as I told you - many were like that.

00:33:56.200 --> 00:34:02.700
But, or could be the other way, that those who are born and trying to be something artificially

00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:08.020
then these spirits come in and they make them clairvoyant. So forget it whatever has happened.

00:34:08.200 --> 00:34:13.800
There's no need to have any clairvoyance any more. You become the owner of that power

00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:20.200
which you know how to maneuver, what it is, how it comes, how it works, everything, so you become a knowledgeable person - an expert.

00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:28.260
Actually I was the same, I had the same ability. As soon as Mother worked on this chakra I lost that thing

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.160
- It happened within days of [UNCLEAR]
- It's a very

00:34:34.060 --> 00:34:37.340
Ah.. stro..  Hmm,

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:45.460
If a person gets realization does he [UNCLEAR - DEPICT?] his karma and the [UNCLEAR - INCARNATION?]

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:53.260
Oh! Now the, when the Kundalini rises above the Agnya chakra, as I told you, it sucks your ego and superego

00:34:53.680 --> 00:35:01.380
so by, by this it sucks in your karmas, it sucks in your kusanskaras,

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:08.820
it sucks in your so called sins. So there is no one. You see, for an animal there is nothing like karma.

00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:19.340
Say a lion has to eat a cow, it eats - it has to eat.

00:35:20.160 --> 00:35:26.740
It doesn't feel it has done some, committed some sin. Have you seen any dog feeling that he's committed some sins

00:35:26.940 --> 00:35:35.480
or sulking? Maybe a dog because he lives with human beings so might [LAUGHTER]

00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:42.260
But animals do what they have to do, they don't carry on with it, they don't commit any sins - nothing.

00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:47.720
The idea of sin has come to us, is because of our ignorance

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:53.480
and because people have said that if you do like this

00:35:53.720 --> 00:36:00.680
then you are crossing your limits, you're going to adharma. That why this idea has come to us.

00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:09.020
But that's what Kundalini is. When she touches this chakra of Mahavishnu, she sucks in all that is

00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:18.180
there - that's the beauty of Kundalini is and you're no more, no more, with your ego or superego -

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.540
so how can you be any more sinful or the karmas are finished.

00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:33.320
On the contrary if you try to cleanse your karmas - you see, I've done bad karmas so I should do this and do that - you build up your ego

00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:39.820
because ego is there. Whatever you do in the name of God, in the name of anything, what you do is to

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.620
just pamper your ego. Even if you're not

00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:55.620
aware of it, it is there. Those people who do missionary work, you must go and see them how they live. They're extremely

00:36:55.880 --> 00:37:01.780
hot tempered ladies, hot tempered men - I know of somebody who has got a peace prize but if you see the person heat,

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:06.400
terrible heat - all the wrinkles you can count one by one on the face.

00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:12.900
Because you think, you see, you're conscious that it is done by me.

00:37:18.980 --> 00:37:22.080
All right! Any other question? [UNCLEAR - WHAT?]

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:30.220
I also [UNCLEAR] your lecture on Friday night [UNCLEAR] sometime

00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:35.840
- All right [UNCLEAR]
- since Friday [UNCLEAR] question to my family [UNCLEAR]

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:42.000
I had heard a lot but it's also [UNCLEAR] and I'm worried about this [UNCLEAR]

00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:48.740
Good, I'm glad you raised that question. She came to your program, she felt tremendous [UNCLEAR]

00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:55.160
awareness and growth and she felt a great deal of love for her family

00:37:55.380 --> 00:38:00.320
but she's also aware that maybe she's going to feel apart  from them

00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:07.680
- or they perhaps apart from her.
- No, you don't get involved into them, that's the point.

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:12.480
You're not apart, you're part and parcel but you're not involved. Say, supposing your child is sick,

00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:18.540
take it like this, and if you're involved with the child then you cannot treat the child.

00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:26.700
You get so upset, you see, if you have to go to the hospital that side you'll take your car the other side

00:38:27.020 --> 00:38:31.580
because you're so upset. But when you're detached you see the whole thing very well

00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:37.900
and you enjoy their love much more because you are in a position to see that love

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:43.520
otherwise you don't see love. When you're involved you don't see anything.

00:38:45.580 --> 00:38:52.300
- Maybe we feel as though we may drift away from...
- No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all.

00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:58.340
on the contrary so many families have come round, so many. You see, we had some people in

00:38:58.820 --> 00:39:06.300
England they were mostly hippies and had left their parents, this, that - they all went back to their parents -

00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:13.080
they brought their parents to sahaja yoga also. Yes, it's not like that but

00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:19.280
you do not take unnecessary burdens. Now supposing, somebody's father is a drunkard - we had one hippy

00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.180
who got alright and then he became very good. Now he's doing very well in life, he's very good fellow

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:31.540
- so he went home and his father used to drink, drink, drink and he was worried this fellow is going to die after about alcoholism -

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:38.800
so he didn't know what to do. So he told him, "Don't drink better take to sahaja yoga, if your Kundalini is raised you will not drink."

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:45.080
"But I like it," he said. "All right." So next he went he broke all his glasses and bottles.

00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:51.580
So when he came home he got very angry. He just kept quiet,this... just laughed. He said, " You go and get some bottle from outside."

00:39:51.820 --> 00:39:56.040
Then, he was already so drunk he couldn't go out anywhere, you see,

00:39:56.300 --> 00:40:01.420
and gradually he found that there's a kind of a protest from the family, they don't like it.

00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:05.380
the way he's drinking - he gave up and he himself is a sahaja yogi today.

00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:12.440
So you correct. When we're involved we don't even want to correct because we're frightened we'll lose our children, lose our love and all that.

00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:20.660
This is no love. Love must prune a person, love must correct a person but in a way that is not so aggressive - in a simple way.

00:40:20.900 --> 00:40:25.240
And the fellow is saved, he would have been dead  with alcoholism, he was about to die.

00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:31.040
So the real love comes, is not indulgences by seeing the person as he is.

00:40:31.240 --> 00:40:35.580
Then you enjoy all the beauties, little, little things that are done how it's bubbling with joy

00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:39.680
and happiness - you see the other person better. But if you're involved

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:46.360
then you can be also selfish, it could be some sort of a possessiveness, can be anything

00:40:46.580 --> 00:40:50.920
but if you're not, you see yourself and you see them - the love is much more.

00:40:51.180 --> 00:40:55.140
There should be some distance for the love to work out, isn't it.

00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:59.560
If you're involved, they are doomed and you are doomed - sort of a position is there.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:06.620
So, it's very good that has happened to you - now you can love them better, much better, in a much more sensible way.

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:15.180
Love has to be nourishing not destroying. Mostly you find when you love your children, so called those who love,

00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:23.140
spoil them. If you love your wife beyond certain limits she becomes a shrew, if you love your husband he becomes alcoholic - like that.

00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:28.740
Love always, in the right sense, means correction.

00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:32.920
But if not, some people say, "All right my husband likes this, doesn't matter."

00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:37.340
Even in England some women say, "All right if he wants to have a keep let him have, I love him."

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:42.040
Can you imagine? "Because I love him let him do what he likes."

00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:47.340
Losing all your self respect, everything,  in the name of love, is nonsense.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:53.520
Any other question? Annh..

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:57.320
[UNCLEAR AND INAUDIBLE] one should eat to help realization

00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:03.320
Other certain foods you should eat to help the self- realization - other certain foods.

00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:10.720
No, no, certain foods hain ? Hun.. [LAUGHTER] I heard

00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:18.200
[LAUGHTER] I'm sorry, I misheard - the foods.

00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:23.300
Ah..no,  you see it is like this, I'll tell you.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:31.000
It's very simple to understand that food is for our body we are not for the food.

00:42:31.880 --> 00:42:37.160
Now some people require some type of food, some people require some type of food.

00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:44.340
For example, a person, who requires more proteins, must eat meat, no doubt, must eat fish.

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.380
What's the use of saving all the chickens, am I going to give them realization?

00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:56.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:02.260
But do you know, that in evolution when you eat the chicken, the chicken has a higher possibility.

00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:10.000
[LAUGHTER]

00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:16.100
So, not such facts but for some people it suits them

00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:22.580
vegetarian food because they have eaten too much of protein, just too much of it, they have certain problems

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:28.880
so they should take to vegetarian for the time being till they correct - there is no fixed food for anyone.

00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:35.760
But for liver patients, now example, here now another fad is nobody should take sugar

00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:42.360
now for liver patients that's the only solution - if you don't take sugar you're going to go out

00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:49.380
absolutely very soon, so then you have to take sugar for liver who are active - those who are, whose liver is active.

00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:54.940
It is depend on what sort of a personality you are, what sort of a food will correct.

00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:00.660
Till you get a balanced personality you have to balance yourself out. But there's no hard and fast rule about it.

00:44:00.900 --> 00:44:04.220
You can eat everything but you don't eat the meat of a bigger animal

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:12.680
because the muscles of a bigger animal are bigger than our muscular system our, annh we can say the

00:44:13.600 --> 00:44:21.100
microscopically if you see your muscle system, your muscles are much smaller than that of, say for, a horse

00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:28.380
but people like to eat horse, elephants, all those things - there is no need to eat all that because it is

00:44:28.800 --> 00:44:34.380
Then, then you will have, there will be no evolution for you neither for them.

00:44:34.540 --> 00:44:37.960
So is not to eat because that makes your muscles odd, funny

00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:42.600
so, that's why you have to eat something that is smaller than you, is all right,

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:49.060
no difference but that doesn't also mean that I'm saying you must eat - may have to eat, may not have to eat.

00:44:49.300 --> 00:44:55.300
We have a community in India which is called Jains, they, some of them have gone to such absurd limit

00:44:55.500 --> 00:45:02.660
that in vegetarianism, if I tell you you will be shocked, that in a village they collect all the bugs,

00:45:02.900 --> 00:45:09.540
all the bugs of the village and get a Brahmin because Brahmin is never a Jain, he's a Hindu, so they put him

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:15.700
in a hut, put all the bugs there - the bugs have to suck in the blood of that Brahmin

00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:22.280
and they're rich people, Jains are, so when the bugs are all dropped out of the body then they give money to the

00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:28.760
Brahmin so they have saved so many bugs - that's what it is, so this is absurd.

00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:36.960
We don't go to any absurdities in sahaja yoga. We have to be extremely normal, simple, pleasant, loving people.

00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:41.400
Now, yes.

00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:48.460
Mother, you mentioned before people going to hell. I'm sorry I asked this question, it's negative,

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.780
quite don't understand the concept of Hell. Can somebody be..?

00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:59.080
- Umm, health, Hell?
- You mentioned in your lecture about people going to Hell

00:45:59.300 --> 00:46:03.960
He doesn't understand this concept - how can people go to Hell - he just doesn't understand.

00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:09.140
Oh, it is something in the house you have something for like a bathroom, isn't it?

00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:17.280
In the same way people have to go to Hell - you must read books to understand - all the great scriptures have described it.

00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:23.000
Mahavira has described it at length what Hell is. People have to go to Hell, they have to ,

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:27.660
they're so troublesome. Do you think Hitler has to enter into the Kingdom of God, should he?

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:34.940
There's no sympathy for such people - God is wrathful. He sends such people to Hell, no doubt, He there is a Hell.

00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:41.040
If you think there is no Hell then you're living in a Paradise which doesn't exist, believe Me.

00:46:41.240 --> 00:46:47.340
There is a Hell. If you do wrong things, if you try to torture others, if you try to extract

00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:53.100
all that what God has given to this world, then, you're to be punished and God punishes.

00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:57.820
Or anybody who says there is no Hell, know that that person Himself is from Hell.

00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:02.240
Believe Me, it is not so, I must warn you - there is Hell. there are people who say

00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:07.720
nobody is bad, everybody is good, everybody could be good - it's not true, is not true.

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:14.680
There are so many devils already existing - what do you think of so many these fake gurus what are they?

00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:25.100
They're all devils, they're all punished in their own ways and devils are devils, no doubt about it.

00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:28.980
[UNCLEAR] eternal Hell?

00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.940
Well is a concept, I mean, do you believe in eternal Hell? I wish there was one.

00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:39.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:47.060
There should be one for such people they again and again come back. [LAUGHTER]

00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:55.180
[LAUGHTER] One gets fed up with them [LAUGHTER]

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:59.620
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Yes?

00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:06.700
- Does Arthritis in the Sacrum hinder the rising of the[UNCLEAR] Kundalini?

00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:09.960
- Sorry, does..
- Arthritis on the..

00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:15.400
- Sacrum
- [UNCLEAR] Yeah
- Does arthritis in the Sacrum hinder the rising of the Kundalini?

00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:20.100
Should not. Arthritis is absolutely curable. Anybody who has arthritis we can cure.

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:26.380
The other day I saw one sahaja yogi with arthritis, why don't you cure him, it's very simple? You know how to cure arthritis, it's very simple.

00:48:26.580 --> 00:48:32.780
It's very, very simple. Actually a person who has arthritis is a good person, normally, is a good person

00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:39.560
has vibrations but is triggered by some sort of a possession or something or kill, chill or some neglect of the body

00:48:39.740 --> 00:48:44.880
can be easily cured - arthritis is absolutely curable. Arthritis doesn't stop the Kundalini rising but

00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:51.940
supposing if you had a bad accident, you are just laid down in bed, I mean you are absolutely a gone case and all that then naturally,

00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:59.620
it is better to take another life, you see, than to make My hands pain, everybody's hands pain working on a case like that.

00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:05.980
You must know that God has got common sense, has lots of common sense.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:11.760
I mean, get common sense from Him. Like the light which is not going to give any light,

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.960
any lamp that is not going to be of any use we just don't - we put it in the junk.

00:49:17.300 --> 00:49:24.020
So is better for such a person to take birth again but arthritis is not a disease, it's not a disease at all.

00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:30.500
It can be cured - have you got arthritis? It can be cured, absolutely curable.

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:36.040
You take out your shoes, put your hands towards Me, just now, take out your shoes.

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:42.200
Put something for her, some sort of a warm thing. Can you put this, can you put this under her feet?

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:49.860
The one, no, on which you are sitting. Hmm. It is curable.

00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:58.820
It's all right - need not take out that. Let it be, let her not take out socks.

00:49:59.600 --> 00:50:05.740
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand out and don't write anything anymore now, just

00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:10.780
just - the arthritis is here, where do you have arthritis?

00:50:13.220 --> 00:50:16.720
- [INAUDIBLE]
- In the Sacrum

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.260
- All right, now put your left hand towards Me
- Lumbar, Lumbar

00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:26.880
All right,  now you just sit down right hand like this towards the Mother Earth, no, left. Just tell her how to do it.

00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:30.360
- Left hand towards Mother and right hand on Mother Earth.
- Yes.

00:50:30.620 --> 00:50:35.720
And one sahaja yogi should put your hand on her Sacrum and put the other on the Mother Earth - finished.

00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.960
You can take it out, anybody.

00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:45.260
Haan. That's better

00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:55.500
Simple as that. Any other question?

00:50:56.960 --> 00:51:04.740
[UNCLEAR] I cannot [UNCLEAR]

00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:10.700
He finds he can't sleep very well, he lies there, he can't turn his brain off, he tosses and turns.

00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:18.980
All right, there's a screw here [LAUGHTER] Just come I'll put it right. Come along

00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:22.640
[UNCLEAR] here now.

00:51:22.860 --> 00:51:27.120
[LAUGHTER] Actually there is

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:40.260
- Just sit down in front of Her.
- What do you do? You are a.. physical work

00:51:40.500 --> 00:51:43.780
- Yeah, I'm a shift worker.
- Annh?
- shift worker, used to be a weight lifter

00:51:43.980 --> 00:51:47.780
- He used to be a weight lifter now he's a shift worker.
- Weight lifting

00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:53.740
[LAUGHTER] So very right sided person, all right  come forward.

00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:59.480
- [UNCLEAR] so She can touch [UNCLEAR]
- Put your right hand towards Me and left hand on the Mother Earth, as it is it will work out

00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:05.000
then maybe, I'll see the screw, all right. Now, what else?

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:14.120
Main bahut saal se [UNCLEAR] Ma ki sirf prarthana karta rehta huun but ekagrata se nahin hoti.

00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:18.640
Achcha ab poocho tum, Ma ko kaunsi, Durga ko maante ho?

00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:23.920
- Nahin, main Gayatri Ma ki puja karta huun
- Achcha to Gayatri sirf ek side hai na, saari Ma ko maana chahiye

00:52:24.260 --> 00:52:31.300
Ma aisi baat hai aise main kisi Ma ko neglect nahin karta par ek baat hai ki hamesha do ghanta karta rehta huun

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:35.420
- par jitni lagan se aur jitni ekagrata se
- Gayatri bahut zyada bhi karna theek nahin hai na

00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:40.960
Achcha aap right hand Meri ore karo aur left hand zameen pe karke. Right hand Meri taraf karo, aise haath rakho zameen par rakho, aise

00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:46.600
nahin aise rakho apni god mein. Aaram se god mein rakho, aaram se jisse aaaram se baith sako, aaram se.

00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:52.720
Aur poora haath aap zameen par rakho, left hand. Achcha ab tum sawaal poocho, "Ma aap swayam sakshat Gayatri ho kya?" Aisa sawaal poocho Mujhse.

00:52:53.220 --> 00:52:57.200
Ma Aap saakshat Gayatri, Aap sakshat  swayam Gayatri ho kya?

00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:01.880
- Again, poocho teen baar
-  Aap saakshat  swayam Gayatri ho kya?

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:05.780
- Hmm.
-  Aap saakshat swayam Gayatri ho kya?

00:53:06.980 --> 00:53:09.420
- Aaya?
-Nahin Ma

00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.100
Dekho bahut zyada tumne istemaal kiya right side.

00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:18.900
Yahi tumhare liye mantra hai ki, "Ma Aap swayam saakshat Gayatri hain?" Woh kada zara nikaal lo ek minute haath se aur kaho

00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:24.160
"Ma Aap swayam saakshat Gayatri," mann mein kaho, abhi shuru ho jayega. Mann mein kehte raho.

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:30.120
- Can anything be done for right hand [UNCLEAR]
- What's it?

00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:35.100
[LAUGHTER] It's the same one that asked the question before.

00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:40.080
- Can anything be done to the numbness in his right hand?
- Yes, yes right hand or left hand?

00:53:40.320 --> 00:53:45.520
All right, come along [LAUGHTER]

00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:51.760
Yes, sit down, sit down anywhere - anywhere you can sit down.

00:53:51.980 --> 00:53:54.920
Now, where have you been, to which guru?

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:58.300
- Not a guru uhh...
- Someone like that

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:04.460
[UNCLEAR] the doctors [UNCLEAR]

00:54:04.860 --> 00:54:11.700
[LAUGHTER] That's how you got it. All right, so put left hand towards Me right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:54:11.900 --> 00:54:15.700
Left hand towards Me right hand.. Can you put a light for him? Just arrange

00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:23.080
You can, you can go at the back and they'll arrange it for you. All right how to sit down. Give him, give him something like that to sit down - same style. Hmm..

00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:26.920
All right, anybody else?

00:54:27.820 --> 00:54:34.300
Better is now. All right, better - see, no more weight lifting.

00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:37.900
[LAUGHTER] - Hann, aa raha hai? Aise haath rakho.

00:54:38.160 --> 00:54:42.800
- Ma aaya, aaya ka matlab main nahin samjha.
- Haath mein thandak si aayegi

00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:46.180
- Haan.
- Aa rahi hai? Bas theek hai. Kaam ban raha hai.

00:54:51.740 --> 00:54:55.340
Everybody should put their hands out towards Mother.

00:54:55.560 --> 00:55:01.500
Now, you do one thing. First of all you put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:06.440
Like this, flat on the earth put your right hand left hand towards Mother.

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:13.660
Those who are sitting at a higher level can do this way, is to put left hand towards Me and like that towards the Mother Earth.

00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:17.780
If you're on a chair just put your right hand towards the earth.

00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:21.740
Are you getting a cool breeze in the hand? Not yet.

00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:25.440
- [UNCLEAR]
- Little bit
- Light, very vague, I'm not sure if it's cool

00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:31.200
- Now, are you getting cool breeze?
- [INAUDIBLE]
- That's it, let it work out

00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:37.960
- On this finger
- Yeah, [UNCLEAR]
- All right.

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:42.680
- Mataji mere haath bahut bhaari lagte hain.
- Hot aa raha hai?

00:55:42.920 --> 00:55:46.160
- Hot nahin, bahut bhaari hai
- Left hand?
- Left hand

00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.160
- Kisi guru uru ke pass gaye the kya?
- Nahi ji

00:55:49.340 --> 00:55:53.920
Kya karte hain ghar mein? Aap joote Meri taraf karke baithe hain, aap Hindustani hain, samajh lijiye

00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:59.040
to aur kya hoga.Haan aise nahi baith sakte Ma ki taraf. Haan seedhe se baithiye

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.880
Can't sit like that, you see, haan. Ab nahi lag raha bhaari?

00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:11.360
Dekha? Gaya bhaaripan - Ma ki taraf pair nahi karke baith sakte.

00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:16.000
You can't sit with the feet towards Me.

00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:23.540
You see, it really showed to the Indian girls because Indians know this but you don't know so it didn't show but you're not supposed to do that.

00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:28.360
But I don't tell anybody if I tell anybody they'll say, " Oh, this lady thinks no end of Herself."

00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:35.020
Typical, that's a fact - theek hai na ab? Gaya bhaaripan - dekho.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:42.200
When You mentioned [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE] my mother thinks that she suffers very badly, I'm trying to

00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:48.260
- In fact I write her to come here tonight. She said [UNCLEAR]
- All right

00:56:48.540 --> 00:56:54.920
All right you get her here, you get her cured, arthritis is curable but first you should be all right yourself.

00:56:55.140 --> 00:57:01.620
You see because you take over. You see, you become a doctor and you treat your mother you can be 24 hours available to her, isn't it?

00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:06.180
It's better that you do it than anybody else does that.

00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:11.420
- If we go to this organization last week, is it all right? I mean is it
- Which organization?

00:57:11.660 --> 00:57:15.920
- the spiritualist [UNCLEAR]
- Oh, is it all right if they continue to go to the spiritualist union?

00:57:16.420 --> 00:57:21.900
Of course not [LAUGHTER]. That's how she got it - your mother used to go there?

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:26.880
Ah, that's it, that's it, that's it.

00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:33.320
I mean if you go to spirits, who are dead spirits, who enter into us through the collective sub-conscious

00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:39.360
I mean one can end up with cancer minimum - horrible!

00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:46.640
It's like, sitting in a boat trying to save yourself and putting your foot in the mouth of a crocodile.

00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:52.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:57.300
- What if she [UNCLEAR] sake of learning?
- Unnh?

00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:01.940
- What if she got of the Victorians [UNCLEAR] union to the sake of learning?

00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:07.160
- I didn't follow.
- What if you to these spiritualists people for the sake of learning?

00:58:07.460 --> 00:58:14.060
What do you learn, all their vidyas, bhoot vidya - What they know is - [ ASIDE - JUST PUT THAT THING THERE]

00:58:14.720 --> 00:58:19.920
What do you learn - nothing. You learn nothing but you get all the bhoots in yourself like this.

00:58:20.140 --> 00:58:25.320
- Umm, you learn, ah..
- No, no, no don't talk. [LAUGHTER]

00:58:25.520 --> 00:58:31.140
You don't learn anything, you get into troubles like this and then it becomes a trouble for others.

00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:38.080
- I got, I got this love in music. I got it [UNCLEAR] Victorian spiritualist
- But, but all right you didn't get because of that

00:58:38.300 --> 00:58:44.860
but you can get. What I said was the words you must understand that if you go to such things you get into trouble like this.

00:58:45.120 --> 00:58:49.840
And now, it is going to be not very easy for us to cure, for the same reason

00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:54.640
because if you go to spirits it's like the one, your foot is in the crocodile's mouth, you see,

00:58:54.980 --> 00:59:01.940
and then how are we to cure you? You want you to be completely in the boat. All right, that's the point.

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:06.500
I didn't say, it could be earlier you might have got it, I'm not saying

00:59:06.700 --> 00:59:12.240
because you got possessed somebody must have done it - there're so many things by which you get this. But, then,

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:20.400
if you have been to these people, it is difficult, we can't work, our hands don't work - see the vibrations return back, they don't act.

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:25.840
See the point is like that - it takes more time. Better now?

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:29.020
Theek hai chalne do. What else?

00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:37.340
[INAUDIBLE] the whole body is very [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:37.440 --> 00:59:42.980
- She's got a , she's got a problem of not been able to raise her arms.
- Diabetic

00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:47.000
- and she's diabetic. But this is small healing, you , you have, you

00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:54.220
All right, now all of you who have been here for healing, that's not good. I must have somebody sensible also here, isn't it? Someone,

00:59:54.460 --> 01:00:01.300
- To now ask some sensible questions
- No, no, that is all right, that is curable, Diabetes is curable, you come to the center they will tell you. Now, who else?

01:00:01.620 --> 01:00:06.740
If you achieve Self-realization in the life what becomes  of you when you die?

01:00:06.940 --> 01:00:11.180
If you achieve Self-realization in your life what happens when you die?

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:17.020
Actually, we shouldn't think of the future we should be in the present but even if you ask the question the thing is then you become

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:22.700
empowered to decide if you want to be born again you can be born again, if you don't want you need not be.

01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:30.560
you can take your Nirvana but mostly all those who are great people want to take birth to save the world.

01:00:30.800 --> 01:00:34.100
So, you become empowered, you can decide for yourself.

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:44.900
- Mother,
- Yes
- what is the easiest way to counteract negativity of other people around you.

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:50.340
What's the easiest way to counteract negativity of other people around you?

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:57.340
You see there are many ways by which - first of all you get your realization, all right? Once you're realized try to keep in thoughtless awareness.

01:00:57.500 --> 01:01:01.160
When you think of those people, if the thought comes to you, you should say,

01:01:01.320 --> 01:01:05.100
"I forgive, I forgive," that's the mantra for that - one of them in the thought process.

01:01:05.320 --> 01:01:11.200
But otherwise it can harmful to you - you write down their names in your hands and just move your hand like this -

01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:17.760
once, twice and thrice - it works. They don't trouble you any more.

01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:21.860
So many things will work out with this - you try this principle, it's very good.

01:01:22.100 --> 01:01:26.020
Uh.. I mean anything - this is we call as bandhan, we call it as the protection.

01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:33.020
So you write anything that you want to do, just put your hands like this - it works out, it's wonderful because the power is flowing through your finger -tips

01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:38.060
and you can manage it, anything, like that or so there are other ways by

01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:42.900
you can avoid but when you'll come next they will tell you how to do it. Now is better now?

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:47.760
- I'm getting uncomfortable.
- Uncomfortable, give him a this thing

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:53.920
- Now, much better now.
- That's what it is - the Victoria has done

01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:59.700
[LAUGHTER] The Victoria Institute of Spirits - Poor Victoria queen, why to call her name, I don't know.

01:02:02.220 --> 01:02:08.060
- Any other question?
- [INAUDIBLE]
- They are all right, not you - Are you better, madam?

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:14.520
Have you been to anybody like that - clairvoyant or someone, annh?

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:20.440
- Take a candle for her
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:20.740 --> 01:02:24.620
- Mother,
- Hmm
- one question is said how do you get this Self- realization?

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.880
- I don't think  he came to the program
- You didn't come to the program -

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:31.380
- Put your hand up.
- through Kundalini awakening.

01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:35.560
- [INAUDIBLE]
- What process is it?

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:43.060
The process is living process, spontaneous process of sprouting - just like a seed sprouts, the Kundalini sprouts out.

01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.560
- [INAUDIBLE]
- How do you sprout a seed?

01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:57.440
It just works out. Haan better, see? Better.

01:02:57.680 --> 01:03:05.380
Thank God you did only weight lifting, but you had gone to an Institute like that, I would never have helped you so fast. [LAUGHTER]

01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:11.640
All right, now put your right hand towards Me all of you.

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:18.840
and left hand like this, like this at the back - put it at the back.

01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:33.340
- Hmm,
- It's flowing.
- see the cool breeze coming in! It's there.

01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.800
See now! That's shaking before Me - that's Victoria Institution.

01:03:41.360 --> 01:03:47.760
- [LAUGHTER]
- I may try
- Haan all right, put your left hand

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:53.680
- It's a possession
- It's a possession
- Just place it

01:03:54.600 --> 01:04:01.480
That has to go first and then you will be all right. Hmm, all right?

01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.360
It'll clear out, it'll clear out, just do that way. It's like just the connection

01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:17.060
Now, if you are a right sided person, you're just putting like this - now you're connected. So what happens

01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:23.240
the vibrations start flowing through here clear your right side  completely and it goes into the

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:27.820
atmosphere, into the Ether - we use the Ether, the Akaasha.

01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:35.940
And if you want to have better results, better use also the water.

01:04:36.220 --> 01:04:43.580
Such people who have right sided problems should sit in the water with a little salt. Those who have left sided problems should use the light.

01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:48.760
They'll tell you all about it you have to come back again. All right! if you don't mind!

01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:55.780
Good! Now you'll sleep like a log of wood, come along, now let Me [LAUGHTER]. Come forward.

01:04:56.560 --> 01:05:03.020
Put your right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me. Close your eyes

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:11.640
Forgive everyone. Theek hai aap. Ab Gayatri bund kariye - abhi yahan aake sahaja yoga seekho pehle phir samajh lo Gayatri kya cheez hai.

01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:19.180
Samyak gyan hona chahiye - must know integrated knowledge not just Gayatri somewhere something, all right! You come and know about it what is Gayatri

01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:27.800
what is what, everything must be known - and you just start doing something with your own ideas, is not proper - you have to know.

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:34.460
- Ma [INAUDIBLE]
- Haan, wohi to, Brahmano ka dimaag issi se kharaab ho gaya hai.

01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:42.880
Pehle Brahman ho jaao, pehle Brahm ko jaano - bada one sided mamla hai [UNCLEAR - SAAB?], hai na?

01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:51.340
- [INAUDIBLE] Ma samajh ke maine shuru kiya
- Theek hai bete, bas Ma samajh ke hi ho jayega - thoda sa imbalance aa gaya na.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:57.500
Samajh lena chahiye, kuch to dosh aa hi gaya hai. Uss dosh ko theek nahi karne ka kya - apne ko kya karne ka hai?

01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:04.520
Bhai Gayatri bhi to hamare liye hai na? Sab cheez hamare liye hai, agar humme usse labh hota hai to lena hai, nahi hota to nahi.

01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:11.820
Hmm, better now - relaxed? Hmm

01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:18.140
[LAUGHTER]

01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:24.420
Now how are you? Better, you see!

01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:33.420
- Sort of it
- Yes, you are better. How are you? Is there a light on her Sacrum?

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:40.220
Are you better now? Just see, stand up -

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:47.220
All right!

01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:53.400
Aap bhi aayiye - Diabetes hai aapko?

01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:58.860
Yahan aayiye - ab put both the hands towards Me.

01:07:00.820 --> 01:07:07.080
- Aap kyaa karte hain - you know Hindi?
- Tamil
- Annh, Tamil - all right, sit down.

01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:12.800
You don't know Hindi at all? All right, sit down. So what do you do, what work do you do?

01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:15.980
- Now, I'm a housewife, now.
- Only housewife?

01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:19.120
- [INAUDIBLE] teacher
- Annh, that's why
- Teacher

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:26.480
Only a teacher can get diabetes not a housewife. [LAUGHTER] because you think too much.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:34.880
You think too much, isn't it? Think too much, all right. Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand like this.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:42.600
Sindur nahi lagate hain - aao, kumkum lagao. Haan now, you're all right? Fine - ab theek ho tum?

01:07:42.800 --> 01:07:45.720
Aao tumhara bhi screw zara dheela ho gaya usse

01:07:47.020 --> 01:07:53.580
- Ma aapke saamne [UNCLEAR]
- Bete ab uspe zyada soch vichar nahi karo, soch vichar se aur badh jaata hai yeh problem.

01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:59.080
Tumhara aur right sided hai. Tum ab aake yahan seekho dhyan kaise karne ka - apne ko shaant kar lo pehle.

01:08:00.640 --> 01:08:08.640
Baat ye Hindustani log padhte zaroorat se zyada hain aur asliyat pe nahi utarte. Yeh log badi jaldi utar jaate hain. Tum log jaante zyada ho maante kam.

01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:12.400
- Ma kuch anubhav nahi hota na
- Abhi dekho, haath mein aa raha hai thanda?

01:08:12.680 --> 01:08:16.800
Ab aa raha hai na, ab to anubhav aa raha hai. Anubhav nahi bhi ho to bhi padhne ki ek hadh hoti hai.

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:23.720
Kabirdasji ne kaha hai, "Padhi, padhi pandit moorakh bhaye." Hamare Marathi mein kehte hain 'Padhat moorkh'

01:08:26.200 --> 01:08:30.700
You see, we Indians know a lot - have no experience.

01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:35.860
So first of all we have to neutralize all that is known.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:43.800
Surdasji, Surdas who was a great poet, he wrote the whole of Sursagar - means the ocean of sur.

01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.120
And there afterwards he says, "O Lord, take away my avidya ," - nonknowledge.

01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:55.900
"Surdas ki sabhi avidya door karo Nandlal." - Haan, ab dekho, aaya kehte hi saath.

01:08:56.180 --> 01:09:03.040
Kabir ne diya - leo, haan dekho, hai na? Abhi aap. May God bless you!

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:08.200
Theek hai.  Aap kisko, Raj Rajeswari ko maante hain?

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:14.140
- Annh?
- I don't understand Hindi.
- Whom, whom do you uh.. Krishna, all right?

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:19.140
- Now, put your hand
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Haan, just let her ask the question

01:09:21.360 --> 01:09:28.540
- Ask the question,
- See your fingers
- "Shri Mataji, are You the avtaar of Adishakti," - look at Her and say, "Shri Mataji, are You the avtaar of Adishakti?"

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.900
- Radha Krishna, haan
- Radha Krishna
- ask.

01:09:32.120 --> 01:09:35.120
- Shri Mataji, yes
- Getting the cool?

01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:40.080
- Yes, it's coming
- Ask the question, "Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?"

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:43.240
- Look at
- Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?

01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:52.920
- Ask
- Ask again
- Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna, Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?

01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:59.060
Ab pehchano - itne din jiski seva ki woh agar saamne  khada jo jaaye to bhi use pehchan nahi sakte

01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:06.980
- Hindi, Hindi nahi
- The One who is standing before, you must recognize

01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:12.040
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Haan
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Now, are you all right?

01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:18.380
- I'm feeling very much better now
- Hmm
- But did you hear what She said? The One who is standing before you, you must recognize.

01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:24.020
Indians have a greater capacity because they know what it is - you must understand that.

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:29.160
You see I - but they understand more than you do - that's surprising.

01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:36.500
Not in India - India is different, of course. We have a tradition,

01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:40.300
we have a tradition of seeking in India.

01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:48.340
It's written down from childhood - everything is worked out for your seeking - you have to get your Self-realization.

01:10:48.540 --> 01:10:52.320
- South Africa
- We have
- South, South Africa
- South Africa

01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:57.680
Oh, to South Africa has lost all the vibrations,  or everything of Indian - uprooted

01:10:57.920 --> 01:11:04.760
- [INAUDIBLE]
- Uh, so what, even in South Africa, if you are an Indian, you must carry your traditions there, you see.

01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:12.780
But it happens, like a mango tree if you bring it, bring it to England it will never prosper, it's like that - they get uprooted, I think.

01:11:15.480 --> 01:11:21.200
- Haan better, see, better?
- Thank You.
- Are you all right? Shakal badal gayi aapki.

01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:25.920
You're all right, now sleep like a log of wood. How is this gentleman? Put your hand

01:11:28.920 --> 01:11:32.820
- Better, not shaking so much
- Not
- Not
- not so much but

01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.860
- Yes, just put your
- sometimes it comes and goes
- Yes, that's the spirit

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:45.080
[LAUGHTER][ Send it back to that Victoria [LAUGHTER] Institute.

01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:52.800
Now, on the left Swadhishthana, work it on the left.

01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:58.900
All right, so now, I'll take your leave. May God bless you all!

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:03.100
Please come, you have got a beautiful center here, we have got a beautiful school

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:10.720
though it's only meant for 20 children, we already have got 20 children - so we can't admit your children here, agreed, but we can start another school

01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:16.940
if you all people help us we can start another place, you can have an ashram nearby your place, somewhere you're living

01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:21.980
we can manage all that but it's to be done by you and is to be arranged and organized.

01:12:22.180 --> 01:12:28.360
You, whatever it is now here, all of them live, they earn, they have this ashram, they run the ashram -

01:12:28.660 --> 01:12:34.320
I don't know what they do with their money - I've nothing to do with it. They know all the accounts, they know among themselves, they live well,

01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:40.420
they live happily, they help each other, they help others. In the same way you all are new people, you can come here

01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:45.920
and then we are going to start ashrams all over Melbourne as we have got in Sydney five ashrams

01:12:46.060 --> 01:12:51.040
and they're doing very well. So, we have to have some places but in the beginning you will have to come here, establish yourself

01:12:51.260 --> 01:12:55.540
and if you say you want to establish some ashram they will look into it and they'll manage. But

01:12:55.740 --> 01:13:00.520
those who have been in sahaja yoga for so many days they know about it - don't try to challenge them,

01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:06.560
don't try to be aggressive, try to listen to them. Understand that I know them and through them I'll know you.

01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:11.260
So, please don't try to be aggressive. There is nothing like uh..

01:13:12.180 --> 01:13:19.000
what you call a one sided life in sahaja yoga. So nobody is going uh.. to be

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:24.360
one sided for you or partial to you or nothing. If they say this is wrong with you please believe them

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:29.240
and just do what they're telling you because they know what is to be done in what case, how to

01:13:29.480 --> 01:13:34.700
uh.. refrain from, how to indulge, how to work it out -

01:13:34.920 --> 01:13:39.100
they know, they have gone through it now, they have been here for four years so they know about it.

01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:46.180
But that doesn't mean in any way you're less, you're in no way less - some of them have just come about a month back, I find them very good

01:13:46.460 --> 01:13:52.840
So, it is for you to learn, to have that humility, to learn more and more and know about it

01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.380
not mentally but through your experiences, different experiences how it works out.

01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:02.080
- Now
- Mother, on Friday you asked us to bring sugar and salt

01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.600
- Yes, that I'm going to say - yes, that's a good idea. So now for that sugar and salt

01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:13.320
we'll be sending you some sugar and salt which is vibrated and you, they'll put it in that. Now don't use your hands

01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:21.260
you use a spoon to stir it and use that - it is vibrated. But those people who have active life should take to sugar more

01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:28.580
and those who have, say this lady has  Diabetes or anything - for her sugar is not good but salt -

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:34.220
so she has to take salt. So that is how it is. So, I'll come inside and vibrate it and then you can bring it here.

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:41.560
All right! So abhi theek hain aap? Kaise lag raha, dard kam hai? Are you better madam, are you feeling better now?

01:14:49.140 --> 01:14:52.300
Good, all right, so done!

01:14:54.420 --> 01:14:57.980
Don't get all the sick people.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:06.440
[CLAPPING]

01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:14.640
- [CLAPPING]
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:15:20.200 --> 01:15:26.700
Good-bye, good-bye. I'll be back again and you all can come to India also

01:15:47.420 --> 01:15:51.680
No, no you do it, you just see that and they will tell you what is to happen

01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:57.080
-  Get somebody to explain to her [UNCLEAR] left hand
- and also tell her husband not to bother her.

01:15:58.420 --> 01:16:01.400
- Tell
- Thank you!
- her husband [UNCLEAR] Shri Mataji

01:16:01.740 --> 01:16:05.400
Thank you, thank you all!

01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:08.800
Excuse me, if you all could sit down for a minute

01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:24.900
Come everyone and try, at the center here every Tuesday, Thursday nights at 7o'clock

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:29.560
On Sundays at 2P.M. we have an evening here, meditation evening

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:35.800
where the committed sahaja yogies [UNCLEAR] about sahaja yoga, you start establishing yourself.

01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:41.820
That's really important to come along. We've had very good response over this last three days

01:16:42.020 --> 01:16:48.120
with people. There must be over thousand people come to the programs. That's really [UNCLEAR] people come to-night

01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:54.060
That's really important that you all come and on this Tuesday normally have a special workshop evening

01:16:54.460 --> 01:17:00.900
[UNCLEAR] can ask you questions, we'll be talking about one of the chakras, first chakra Mooladhara chakra

01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:07.820
So, thanks for all coming. We have a cup of tea while at the back if you wish to stay.

01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:14.200
[UNCLEAR] May I suggest that when you are here in

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:22.240
Victoria, to all the sahaja yogies who are here, that when you discuss the base chakra, you also explain in general the practices

01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:26.900
of sahaja yoga. We don't limit ourselves just to the one chakra each week.

01:17:27.200 --> 01:17:33.520
We learn more about the chakra but in general we'll explain to you the sorts of things that were happening here -

01:17:33.780 --> 01:17:38.640
how to clear out the chakras, how to work it out so that you can get on with it but a concentration

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:44.760
will be made on one particular aspect each week. But you learn all about the various methods of balancing,

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:51.200
clearing out the blockages, removing possessions that have crept in over our life time, love,

01:17:51.480 --> 01:17:57.240
diminishing the ego whatever it is. That can be worked out in a very practical way and that's what they want to show you.

01:17:58.040 --> 01:18:03.640
Center will be every Tuesday and Thursday night at  70'clock and 2 P.M. on Sundays

01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.240
At the back we have some [UNCLEAR] which is a photograph of Shri Mataji

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:17.340
It will explain how to meditate at home, how to clear yourself out at bedtime and also has a program [UNCLEAR]

01:18:19.020 --> 01:18:25.700
Could the, the sahaja yoginies please just partly [UNCLEAR] inside quickly please.

01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.600
Just the ladies, just move inside quickly.
