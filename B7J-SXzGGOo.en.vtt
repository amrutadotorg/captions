00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:06.078
1989-0527 Public Program Hotel Hilton, Istanbul, Turkey

00:00:06.358 --> 00:00:11.320
This morning I saw the beautiful sea

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.560
that is surrounding this beautiful place of Istanbul

00:00:24.005 --> 00:00:27.544
and the nature so beautiful all around.

00:00:31.883 --> 00:00:37.662
But problem is with human beings only.

00:00:41.443 --> 00:00:43.956
If you go in the forest

00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:48.046
you’ll find forest is a very, very clean place.

00:00:53.094 --> 00:00:55.270
There are tigers.

00:00:55.491 --> 00:00:57.467
There are other animals

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:03.657
but it’s absolutely clean

00:01:03.682 --> 00:01:07.607
and there is no bad smell or anything anywhere.

00:01:14.036 --> 00:01:17.033
But if some human being go and live there

00:01:17.047 --> 00:01:19.663
then you will immediately know.

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.492
The reason lies with us that

00:01:29.758 --> 00:01:34.559
we have not yet achieved our absolute  being

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:46.732
which is so glorifying and so beautiful.

00:01:51.385 --> 00:01:55.653
As it is we have evolved much more than animals.

00:02:04.817 --> 00:02:09.524
You can see if you ask a dog

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:12.628
to pass through any dirty lane

00:02:12.642 --> 00:02:15.820
he can do it very easily, no problem.

00:02:26.242 --> 00:02:29.177
And you see even a horse doing the same thing.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.985
But human beings cannot.

00:02:37.892 --> 00:02:41.087
They cannot bear the dirt  and filth.

00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:46.443
So we have evolved.

00:02:49.547 --> 00:02:52.085
We have evolved to the state

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.383
where we are human beings.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.989
But still l may tell you

00:03:01.014 --> 00:03:05.508
whatever we may believe into,
whatever faith we may have,

00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:08.285
still we are not powerful people

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:19.920
because we give way to wrong things very easily.

00:03:23.743 --> 00:03:25.533
Now it was said,

00:03:25.553 --> 00:03:30.385
Mohammed Sahib had said that
one should not drink alcohol.

00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:38.020
It was for our good

00:03:39.951 --> 00:03:44.159
because it goes against our human awareness.

00:03:49.986 --> 00:03:52.098
But I don’t blame people who

00:03:52.123 --> 00:03:55.442
drink because they are not saints.

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:02.873
Say if they are in  the yard

00:04:02.898 --> 00:04:05.259
they don’t drink at all  I’ve seen them,

00:04:05.284 --> 00:04:09.730
but if they come to London they drink more than any Scotch man

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:22.919
because we have not achieved our absolute nature.

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:31.548
We can become slave of anything.

00:04:35.446 --> 00:04:38.903
We may not believe in slavery.

00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:44.683
For example I see in the West now

00:04:44.692 --> 00:04:47.504
people think they are living free.

00:04:51.288 --> 00:04:53.316
But they are not.

00:04:55.251 --> 00:04:59.759
Now they are getting entrapped into drugs

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.954
and even a twelve year old child you will find taking drugs.

00:05:13.592 --> 00:05:16.760
Worst in England I’ve heard that

00:05:16.785 --> 00:05:21.426
children are killed by parents every week too,

00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:23.146
[unclear]

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.287
So what sort of a progress have we made

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.058
that this one war is over?

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:41.930
Are you are preparing for another war?

00:05:46.329 --> 00:05:48.409
Apart from that,

00:05:48.463 --> 00:05:50.404
whenever you see

00:05:50.424 --> 00:05:53.823
you do not feel that anybody is doing

00:05:54.163 --> 00:05:56.869
absolutely right things.

00:06:03.643 --> 00:06:06.468
Somebody will be a great friend today.

00:06:06.493 --> 00:06:10.090
Tomorrow he’ll turn out to be your greatest enemy.

00:06:16.608 --> 00:06:21.946
So there is the understanding

00:06:22.227 --> 00:06:27.839
of  we all being part and parcel of one personality,

00:06:27.864 --> 00:06:32.391
the macrocosm becoming the microcosm is not there.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.159
We are still very individualistic

00:06:45.723 --> 00:06:49.015
and extremely prone to slavery.

00:06:53.098 --> 00:06:56.450
Now for example a entrepreneur starts a fashion,

00:06:56.475 --> 00:07:02.379
say tomorrow that you can put a little tin on your head

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:04.099
and tie up your hair.

00:07:04.124 --> 00:07:07.045
All the ladies will start doing that.

00:07:18.605 --> 00:07:22.921
Any fashion they start it works.

00:07:25.556 --> 00:07:30.105
For example in London people were making the hair into red,

00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:36.049
yellow, all colours, they call it puncs [unclear] .

00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:46.781
It is over because now it makes them blind.

00:07:50.934 --> 00:07:54.679
So the human being today, modern times wants to

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:57.516
try everything that is new.

00:08:02.584 --> 00:08:05.601
This is our modern trend

00:08:09.883 --> 00:08:12.241
and if you ask them why you are doing?,

00:08:12.254 --> 00:08:14.594
they say, “What’s wrong”?

00:08:21.294 --> 00:08:24.186
Like Me  I one day I had dinner

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:26.661
once with the ambassador of Mexico

00:08:26.679 --> 00:08:30.131
and he told Me that why you don’t like Freud

00:08:30.156 --> 00:08:32.548
and why you like Jung?

00:08:41.572 --> 00:08:45.605
I said because Freud has brought forth Aids

00:08:51.007 --> 00:08:53.940
and Jung is traditional.

00:08:57.683 --> 00:09:04.719
He based his discoveries  on something that is very  traditional.

00:09:09.649 --> 00:09:12.606
He did put his own ideas

00:09:12.631 --> 00:09:16.664
but he went round the world to see what is relevant.

00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:27.537
But what about Freud?

00:09:29.689 --> 00:09:32.217
He starts some new ideas.

00:09:34.597 --> 00:09:36.900
So he said,  “I’d like to do something new.

00:09:36.925 --> 00:09:39.398
Because a very modern man”.

00:09:44.464 --> 00:09:47.038
I said then we have eaten the food

00:09:47.063 --> 00:09:48.906
all the time why not eat the table.

00:09:48.931 --> 00:09:49.993
It’s a new thing.

00:09:58.383 --> 00:10:01.823
This is what’s wrong with us that we have a lack

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.453
that absolute logic.

00:10:12.565 --> 00:10:18.842
Now his absolute logic is lost in the modern times,

00:10:20.164 --> 00:10:22.436
most intensively,

00:10:28.348 --> 00:10:31.008
and people are confused.

00:10:35.422 --> 00:10:37.509
I was very angry with Rashneed

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:40.533
for saying things against Mohammed Sahib.

00:10:40.582 --> 00:10:42.721
He had no business

00:10:53.038 --> 00:10:57.709
because he doesn’t know anything about Mohammed Sahib.

00:11:01.247 --> 00:11:05.246
It’s very nice way of making money, that’s all.

00:11:14.448 --> 00:11:18.327
Because in modern times such a man people like.

00:11:22.988 --> 00:11:24.767
But what was his education?

00:11:24.792 --> 00:11:27.615
What was his understanding?

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:34.837
He’s not a spiritual man.

00:11:38.363 --> 00:11:42.262
He doesn’t have  ilmi ruhani
(spiritual knowledge).

00:11:45.172 --> 00:11:50.080
How many told about somebody such a great incarnation

00:11:50.105 --> 00:11:53.902
of a primordial master like Mohammed Sahib?

00:12:01.073 --> 00:12:03.720
So one has to realise that

00:12:03.745 --> 00:12:05.806
in these modern times there are

00:12:05.831 --> 00:12:08.632
many people who are trying to mislead us

00:12:08.657 --> 00:12:12.287
and taking us away from the spiritual,

00:12:12.312 --> 00:12:16.519
real spiritual life and real spiritual leaders.

00:12:30.137 --> 00:12:33.525
Yesterday I told you quite a lot about the false gurus

00:12:33.550 --> 00:12:36.167
from India and all over the world

00:12:41.363 --> 00:12:43.877
and also warn you be careful,

00:12:48.212 --> 00:12:52.760
because in the modern times

00:12:52.944 --> 00:12:55.380
we have become quite frustrated

00:12:55.405 --> 00:12:58.164
and we are seeking the truth.

00:13:03.700 --> 00:13:09.741
And when such a market is there people have full idea

00:13:09.768 --> 00:13:12.196
how to make money out of you.

00:13:21.962 --> 00:13:26.692
Unless and until you get your self realisation

00:13:26.716 --> 00:13:30.786
you will not find out who is false and who is real.

00:13:38.421 --> 00:13:42.360
Because then only your fingers speak,

00:13:43.226 --> 00:13:46.819
hands will speak, I say [unclear]

00:13:52.087 --> 00:13:55.634
and your feet will be witness against  too

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:03.180
that means you become like a divine computer yourself.

00:14:08.042 --> 00:14:12.172
Koran is a very deep knowledge, very deep.

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:22.040
My father translated Koran into Hindi language

00:14:22.065 --> 00:14:24.450
because he knew fourteen languages

00:14:30.982 --> 00:14:35.023
and he told Me by translation they cannot understand.

00:14:35.068 --> 00:14:37.608
They have to have self realisation otherwise

00:14:37.622 --> 00:14:39.922
they cannot understand Koran.

00:14:48.696 --> 00:14:53.382
That means you are have direct connection with God with the Ruh,

00:14:53.393 --> 00:14:55.974
with the all pervading power.

00:15:03.445 --> 00:15:06.765
So you are endowed with this power.

00:15:09.168 --> 00:15:15.159
So you become powerful and knowledgeable.

00:15:21.911 --> 00:15:24.972
All this knowledge is within you already.

00:15:27.613 --> 00:15:30.546
All this divine love is in your heart

00:15:33.319 --> 00:15:37.813
and all that divine attention is in your gener.

00:15:43.421 --> 00:15:47.431
Only thing you have to have the last breakthrough

00:15:47.777 --> 00:15:49.652
as Jung has said.

00:15:55.531 --> 00:16:00.665
There was a poet in England many years back called William Blake

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:03.779
and all English thought that he was a mad man,

00:16:03.804 --> 00:16:08.133
he talked about these modern times.

00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:25.760
People like somebody

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:28.540
who will support their weaknesses and leave them

00:16:28.554 --> 00:16:31.877
more weak and more weak and more weak

00:16:37.913 --> 00:16:40.006
and ruin them.

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.759
But all the strength is in your spirit.

00:16:51.997 --> 00:16:55.364
All this understanding is within you.

00:16:59.092 --> 00:17:05.099
You are after all the highest,
the epitome of evolution.

00:17:05.125 --> 00:17:07.164
Nobody’s higher than you,

00:17:14.052 --> 00:17:17.328
except for the God Almighty

00:17:17.368 --> 00:17:22.929
and the prophets and saints.

00:17:31.573 --> 00:17:34.159
So now we have to  understand

00:17:34.184 --> 00:17:36.403
that the time has come,

00:17:36.437 --> 00:17:37.758
the Kiyama (to stand up),

00:17:37.779 --> 00:17:40.722
Kiyama described in the Koran,

00:17:40.742 --> 00:17:43.210
Kiyama is the resurrection time.

00:17:45.139 --> 00:17:49.500
We have to ascend to that stage where we become the Spirit, the Ruh.

00:17:55.765 --> 00:17:59.871
It’s more for the people who read Koran

00:18:00.003 --> 00:18:01.876
than for anybody else

00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.758
because Mohammed Sahib is the biggest that we have.

00:18:13.084 --> 00:18:16.524
So it is for you to get your realisation.

00:18:21.766 --> 00:18:25.545
It will give you greater faith in Mohammed Sahib

00:18:25.569 --> 00:18:28.157
and his teachings and his life

00:18:28.184 --> 00:18:31.744
and you’ll understand him much more.

00:18:39.157 --> 00:18:42.377
You'll understand why he had to marriage [unclear]

00:18:42.402 --> 00:18:44.849
who were his wives.

00:18:50.307 --> 00:18:53.084
You’ll understand what was his nature.

00:18:53.109 --> 00:18:55.388
What was his divine nature.

00:18:55.869 --> 00:18:58.715
Who he was before he became Mohammed Sahib.

00:19:11.498 --> 00:19:15.277
He was very humble and he never talked about himself,

00:19:19.889 --> 00:19:23.758
and the whole life people just fought with him.

00:19:27.683 --> 00:19:30.462
In modern times, thank God there are no more swords

00:19:30.487 --> 00:19:33.632
left for the people to fight with.

00:19:38.238 --> 00:19:41.691
But people are wiser.

00:19:45.938 --> 00:19:47.684
They are seekers.

00:19:48.858 --> 00:19:50.231
They are honest

00:19:51.078 --> 00:19:52.853
and they are seekers of truth.

00:19:55.448 --> 00:19:58.553
Sahaja Yoga is made for such people,

00:20:01.983 --> 00:20:04.590
not for the frivolous

00:20:08.093 --> 00:20:12.403
or not for the people who are giving you some conditionings.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:17.890
Actually I was surprised the other day.

00:20:17.905 --> 00:20:22.246
I was looking at the top boys

00:20:22.254 --> 00:20:24.628
and girls we have in Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:24.637 --> 00:20:28.698
Never surprised that they are all top of universities,

00:20:36.142 --> 00:20:40.457
that means there is a peak of intelligence if needed.

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.968
Intelligence it doesn’t teach itself

00:20:53.047 --> 00:20:56.002
but sees the variety

00:20:57.591 --> 00:21:02.081
and understands that it is for your benevolence.

00:21:06.547 --> 00:21:09.038
The importance of that is

00:21:10.476 --> 00:21:12.986
that you know yourself and you know

00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.346
what is the meaning of your life.

00:21:21.113 --> 00:21:23.869
It’s all within you. It’s your own.

00:21:27.801 --> 00:21:31.988
It is nothing that I am going to do much about.

00:21:35.338 --> 00:21:39.230
It’s your own power which you are going to get.

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:43.172
It’s your own power.

00:21:45.553 --> 00:21:51.853
It is we can say it is your own property which has to be manifest.

00:21:57.931 --> 00:22:00.516
As a result is you may

00:22:00.627 --> 00:22:04.934
get completely cured of health.

00:22:05.141 --> 00:22:08.456
Mentally you feel very relaxed

00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:12.162
and you feel the peace within.

00:22:19.155 --> 00:22:25.401
This transformation creates a new type of race.

00:22:30.714 --> 00:22:34.736
Those who understand the essence of all the religions

00:22:41.607 --> 00:22:43.859
and respect themselves

00:22:46.308 --> 00:22:50.501
because they have self knowledge; they have self respect

00:22:55.518 --> 00:23:01.309
And those who have self respect, respect others also.

00:23:05.462 --> 00:23:07.950
But its not an educate

00:23:07.966 --> 00:23:10.879
or some sort of an outward behaviour.

00:23:10.894 --> 00:23:13.471
It is innate

00:23:20.785 --> 00:23:25.562
and it should work out for all of you.

00:23:32.129 --> 00:23:34.321
It should.

00:23:39.462 --> 00:23:44.050
I think we should have now the experience of self realisation

00:23:48.888 --> 00:23:51.999
because yesterday I was very happy,

00:23:52.016 --> 00:23:56.834
a gentleman said that a misunderstanding about a yogi

00:23:56.849 --> 00:24:00.175
and that’s why they asked questions.

00:24:16.376 --> 00:24:19.511
And he thought that the yogi

00:24:19.526 --> 00:24:23.259
there is a person who has  skewers in the body.

00:24:32.183 --> 00:24:33.664
It’s not so.

00:24:34.736 --> 00:24:36.893
It is nothing outside.

00:24:40.725 --> 00:24:43.898
You have to lead a very normal life.

00:24:47.783 --> 00:24:51.316
You have to be married as you are

00:24:54.992 --> 00:24:57.825
and you have beautiful children.

00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:03.663
But you lead a very righteous and beautiful life

00:25:03.688 --> 00:25:06.234
of friendship and love.

00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:15.875
May God bless you.

00:25:20.198 --> 00:25:22.791
So should we have the experience now?

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:52.870
Where are you going?

00:26:14.792 --> 00:26:16.279
Hello,

00:26:16.343 --> 00:26:19.096
You see before taking my photograph

00:26:19.110 --> 00:26:21.997
please ask permission. All right?

00:26:22.017 --> 00:26:24.777
You can see, he didn’t ask permission

00:26:24.787 --> 00:26:27.560
so  these boys have an objection

00:26:28.153 --> 00:26:32.059
that he should have taken My permission before.

00:26:35.814 --> 00:26:38.026
It’s all right.  It’s all right.

00:26:38.156 --> 00:26:39.589
It’s all right.

00:26:39.603 --> 00:26:41.617
No, no they will .

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.819
No, no they will have now.

00:26:43.846 --> 00:26:47.760
It’s all right I don’t mind,
I don’t mind. It’s all right.

00:26:48.407 --> 00:26:49.768
Now,

00:26:52.752 --> 00:26:56.262
as you are newspaper people

00:26:56.489 --> 00:27:00.603
you have to become absolute witnesses

00:27:09.054 --> 00:27:11.777
and should not be biased.

00:27:12.075 --> 00:27:14.714
and should not be biased.

00:27:17.274 --> 00:27:19.633
And have to be fair.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:25.791
You see in every country they

00:27:25.816 --> 00:27:29.170
reveal lots of things so much.

00:27:29.481 --> 00:27:35.135
The young are exposed to so many dangerous things

00:27:41.967 --> 00:27:44.306
and nothing can protect them.

00:27:46.629 --> 00:27:51.172
Any amount of military or putting you cannot stop

00:27:51.197 --> 00:27:53.632
these dangerous things that are walking

00:27:53.643 --> 00:27:56.542
into our societies everywhere.

00:28:01.943 --> 00:28:06.051
So these young people have to be

00:28:06.076 --> 00:28:08.650
powerful  withstand that.

00:28:14.493 --> 00:28:16.676
They must be helped,

00:28:18.455 --> 00:28:22.165
and that is why I am travelling

00:28:22.206 --> 00:28:25.569
and telling them what is to be done.

00:28:30.671 --> 00:28:34.841
Now we have thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis

00:28:34.912 --> 00:28:39.165
out of which at least fifty percent were drug addicts.

00:28:50.807 --> 00:28:52.687
All of them have given up.

00:28:55.585 --> 00:28:58.246
They don’t touch it now.
They don’t want it now.

00:29:00.252 --> 00:29:05.693
Like the dog could go in the dirty lane,

00:29:12.390 --> 00:29:15.476
in the same way when we are not realised

00:29:15.501 --> 00:29:19.133
we can accept any sinful thing,

00:29:19.158 --> 00:29:21.878
which is destructive for ourselves

00:29:30.947 --> 00:29:34.379
but once you are self realised

00:29:37.243 --> 00:29:39.949
you think its a filth.

00:29:42.047 --> 00:29:43.777
It is dirt

00:29:45.447 --> 00:29:47.904
and you just don’t accept it.

00:29:49.761 --> 00:29:52.514
You just don’t feel tempted about it.

00:29:57.112 --> 00:29:59.985
So please I would request you young newspaper people

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:02.700
and I know sometimes newspaper people

00:30:02.734 --> 00:30:06.393
try to make something very interesting

00:30:15.403 --> 00:30:23.265
but try, try to make things which will help.

00:30:28.728 --> 00:30:34.131
As you know my husband is Secretary General of International Maritime Organisation

00:30:40.593 --> 00:30:43.361
and he has visited temple many a times.

00:30:46.177 --> 00:30:48.277
Yesterday he told Me that

00:30:48.302 --> 00:30:50.697
Turkish people are very kabil.

00:30:50.715 --> 00:30:53.722
Kabil's means capable,

00:30:57.582 --> 00:30:59.848
and he is very much in impressed by it.

00:31:03.187 --> 00:31:09.137
My husband himself is so surprised at My work,

00:31:09.682 --> 00:31:12.884
that I have transformed [unclear].

00:31:21.622 --> 00:31:24.357
Of course he’s a very religious man

00:31:24.382 --> 00:31:28.745
but he always said that you are an [unclear audia]

00:31:28.755 --> 00:31:31.048
[unclear audia] means a worry to Me.

00:31:31.317 --> 00:31:34.884
My husband used to say [unclear audia], means a worry.

00:31:42.650 --> 00:31:45.152
You are above every temptation.

00:31:48.292 --> 00:31:51.738
But you cannot make others like, this I can tell you,

00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:57.441
whatever you may try.

00:31:59.098 --> 00:32:02.495
But now he has openly said

00:32:02.517 --> 00:32:08.051
that this is the emancipation everything.

00:32:15.869 --> 00:32:20.485
And he said My honesty now compels him to say

00:32:20.510 --> 00:32:23.673
that this is going to save humanity.

00:32:31.704 --> 00:32:35.450
He said, “You are making angels out of these people”.

00:32:45.232 --> 00:32:47.439
It is really

00:32:47.623 --> 00:32:52.276
is  hard going bureaucrat my husband

00:32:58.571 --> 00:33:04.361
extremely honest and very brave.

00:33:07.007 --> 00:33:09.948
But the way he has now seen it.

00:33:09.973 --> 00:33:14.264
And he saw the newspaper people who proceed with honesty,

00:33:25.771 --> 00:33:29.398
the brotherhood of all the nations.

00:33:32.139 --> 00:33:35.292
The respect of all the nations.

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:41.694
The respect of all the religions and the brave prophets.

00:33:45.861 --> 00:33:49.034
It will all  descend on us

00:33:52.344 --> 00:33:55.337
in  this  knowledge, the self knowledge.

00:34:01.723 --> 00:34:03.730
Thank you.

00:34:18.549 --> 00:34:22.415
Now we have to take out our shoes

00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:24.272
as I told you yesterday

00:34:24.296 --> 00:34:27.340
because it can be tight on our feet first of all

00:34:27.365 --> 00:34:31.234
and secondly it’s nice to take the help of Mother Earth.

00:34:50.048 --> 00:34:51.041
You also try.

00:34:51.066 --> 00:34:51.949
You also try

00:34:51.974 --> 00:34:55.460
what will you become great newspaper piece, dynamic.

00:35:06.589 --> 00:35:10.130
Question: The gentleman wonders to know if he can photograph

00:35:10.155 --> 00:35:13.187
during the experience?

00:35:13.212 --> 00:35:15.717
Shri Mataji:  No, that time will disturb you see it.

00:35:15.738 --> 00:35:17.477
It's Namaz.

00:35:18.249 --> 00:35:19.675
That is  like namaz.

00:35:19.682 --> 00:35:22.647
and you can’t disturb at that time.

00:35:27.941 --> 00:35:30.622
I’m sorry that time please don’t disturb.

00:35:30.647 --> 00:35:33.962
It’s not civil. It’s not civil.

00:35:36.523 --> 00:35:38.429
Best thing is you get your realisation,

00:35:38.454 --> 00:35:42.751
take your photograph later, before and after.

00:35:49.477 --> 00:35:51.970
And you feel very peaceful.

00:35:52.054 --> 00:35:55.060
Say I am 67 years of age

00:35:57.073 --> 00:36:00.899
and I am travelling all the time.

00:36:10.317 --> 00:36:13.356
On last night to slept three or more.

00:36:15.295 --> 00:36:18.822
The whole day I [UNCLEAR] walking here and there.

00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:28.089
[UNCLEAR]

00:36:33.059 --> 00:36:34.059
All right.

00:36:35.716 --> 00:36:38.137
It’s very simple.  It’s your own.

00:36:38.150 --> 00:36:40.937
You don’t have to do anything about it.

00:36:46.101 --> 00:36:50.020
There’s a group of people, why are they laughing so much? I don’t know.

00:36:57.198 --> 00:36:58.865
There’s nothing to laugh.

00:37:00.198 --> 00:37:02.931
Of course nothing to serious also

00:37:07.611 --> 00:37:11.805
but one has to have the open mind of a scientist.

00:37:18.065 --> 00:37:19.812
If you want you can come in front

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:22.231
instead of standing there is space for you to sit down.

00:37:25.906 --> 00:37:29.038
Please come forward. There is place.

00:37:29.236 --> 00:37:30.915
You have to be seated.

00:37:30.936 --> 00:37:32.790
You have to be comfortable.

00:37:37.133 --> 00:37:38.906
You have to be comfortable.

00:37:49.074 --> 00:37:50.580
Now.

00:38:00.666 --> 00:38:03.430
You don't have to excess at all.

00:38:03.451 --> 00:38:08.235
Nothing excited, sahaja means easy, simple also.

00:38:13.421 --> 00:38:17.220
On the contrary you should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself

00:38:17.249 --> 00:38:19.182
to begin with.

00:38:19.196 --> 00:38:21.526
You should have no guilt.

00:38:28.048 --> 00:38:32.189
After all we are human beings and if we have committed mistakes

00:38:32.223 --> 00:38:34.255
it’s not important.

00:38:40.411 --> 00:38:42.217
We are not God.

00:38:43.446 --> 00:38:44.585
We are not God.

00:38:44.605 --> 00:38:46.998
God does not commit mistakes you see.

00:38:52.898 --> 00:38:56.066
So we have to be absolutely

00:38:56.091 --> 00:38:57.984
forgiving ourselves

00:38:58.006 --> 00:39:01.132
and loving yourself, I'm sure.

00:39:07.781 --> 00:39:10.120
It’s very simple. I tell you first

00:39:10.145 --> 00:39:13.644
when you keep your eyes open and later on

00:39:13.669 --> 00:39:16.478
I will tell you when you have to close your eyes.

00:39:25.003 --> 00:39:27.046
Marcus from Austria will show you.

00:39:27.071 --> 00:39:32.585
He is an engineer.

00:39:32.592 --> 00:39:36.398
But, [UNCLEAR] yourself engineering on the self also.

00:39:46.408 --> 00:39:47.895
So you please

00:39:47.916 --> 00:39:50.856
put your left hand towards Me

00:39:55.091 --> 00:39:59.684
which means you desire to have realisation, that’s all.

00:40:05.490 --> 00:40:06.490
as you have to use the right hand for releasing.

00:40:06.962 --> 00:40:09.942
as you have to use the right hand for releasing.

00:40:09.967 --> 00:40:11.913
You can keep it on your lap.
It’s all right.

00:40:11.937 --> 00:40:14.814
You need not put it like that because it will hurt.

00:40:18.898 --> 00:40:20.624
Can you put it down.  Its better

00:40:20.649 --> 00:40:21.897
Stand up please.

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:02.330
Now left hand towards Me

00:41:03.703 --> 00:41:06.429
arm apart from each other

00:41:07.446 --> 00:41:11.872
There are two different powers within us.

00:41:19.249 --> 00:41:20.822
Can you hear Me?

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:28.209
Now the one power is the power of desire

00:41:28.234 --> 00:41:31.104
and another is the power of action.

00:41:38.429 --> 00:41:41.572
Now you put the left hand towards Me meaning

00:41:41.597 --> 00:41:44.125
that have a desire get our realisation.

00:41:49.692 --> 00:41:53.706
All right. So we put our left hand like this

00:41:53.731 --> 00:41:57.100
and right hand on our different centres.

00:42:04.284 --> 00:42:06.876
We work only on the left hand side.

00:42:09.631 --> 00:42:13.170
So first we put it on our heart,

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:20.124
where resides the Kundalini and
where resides the Spirit.

00:42:24.842 --> 00:42:27.321
Then we put our right hand

00:42:27.337 --> 00:42:30.636
on the upper portion of our abdomen.

00:42:36.294 --> 00:42:40.247
This is the centre of our mastery.

00:42:48.331 --> 00:42:51.377
Is created by own masters.

00:42:55.655 --> 00:42:57.701
Now we put our right hand

00:42:57.728 --> 00:43:00.214
on the lower portion of our abdomen.

00:43:06.105 --> 00:43:09.578
This is the centre of pure knowledge

00:43:09.605 --> 00:43:13.568
which manifests in our central nervous system

00:43:23.776 --> 00:43:27.509
and gives us the  knowledge of the divine laws.

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:40.129
Now we raise our right hand in to be  upper portion of abdomen.

00:43:46.416 --> 00:43:49.135
Then we raise it again on the heart.

00:43:52.869 --> 00:43:56.775
Then we raise in the corner of your neck

00:43:56.800 --> 00:44:01.032
and your shoulder and

00:44:01.052 --> 00:44:03.512
turn your face to your right.

00:44:14.685 --> 00:44:17.972
This is the centre will catch when you feel guilty.

00:44:23.311 --> 00:44:24.804
It is a very dangerous thing

00:44:24.845 --> 00:44:28.337
because it gives you diseases like angina,

00:44:28.362 --> 00:44:31.598
heart diseases and also spondylitis.

00:44:42.925 --> 00:44:45.911
Now we raise, put our hand

00:44:45.932 --> 00:44:48.537
on top of our forehead and press it hard

00:44:53.162 --> 00:44:54.908
on both the sides.

00:44:56.342 --> 00:44:59.093
This is the centre of forgiving.

00:45:01.719 --> 00:45:04.659
We bend our head like this so it’s easier.

00:45:09.366 --> 00:45:12.686
Now we put our hand on the backside of our head

00:45:12.713 --> 00:45:15.143
and put our head on top of that.

00:45:21.885 --> 00:45:27.141
This is the centre for asking forgiveness

00:45:32.552 --> 00:45:34.488
without feeling guilty.

00:45:38.186 --> 00:45:41.873
Now please stretch your hand

00:45:43.584 --> 00:45:46.220
and the centre of your palm

00:45:48.085 --> 00:45:50.407
is to be put on top of your

00:45:52.235 --> 00:45:55.618
fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:01.993
Press back your fingers.

00:46:04.424 --> 00:46:05.538
Press it hard

00:46:07.791 --> 00:46:11.621
and move your scalp seven times clockwise.

00:46:23.078 --> 00:46:24.078
Slowly.

00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.080
That’s all we have to do all together.

00:46:38.433 --> 00:46:40.223
Now you have to close your eyes.

00:46:40.248 --> 00:46:42.417
You can take out your spectacles also,

00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:50.803
and please don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

00:46:56.651 --> 00:46:57.611
All right.

00:46:57.639 --> 00:47:00.671
Now close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart.

00:47:05.765 --> 00:47:10.773
Now here you have to ask Me a very fundamental question,

00:47:10.813 --> 00:47:13.532
Mother am I the spirit?

00:47:13.556 --> 00:47:16.476
Please ask this in your heart.

00:47:32.677 --> 00:47:37.947
Now if you are your spirit

00:47:39.046 --> 00:47:43.314
and nothing else then you are your master.

00:47:51.058 --> 00:47:57.359
So please take this hand on the lower portion,

00:47:57.498 --> 00:48:01.902
upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

00:48:07.031 --> 00:48:09.197
and press it hard.

00:48:11.034 --> 00:48:13.527
Now here

00:48:15.569 --> 00:48:21.934
you have to say a question again to Me.

00:48:22.921 --> 00:48:26.328
Mother am I my own master?

00:48:26.354 --> 00:48:28.534
Ask this question three times.

00:48:47.677 --> 00:48:51.683
Now I must confess that I cannot

00:48:52.329 --> 00:48:57.286
come over your freedom.

00:48:57.476 --> 00:48:59.463
I respect your freedom

00:49:08.921 --> 00:49:12.921
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

00:49:18.032 --> 00:49:22.718
So put your right hand on the lower portion of your abdomen

00:49:25.776 --> 00:49:27.483
and press it

00:49:28.371 --> 00:49:35.279
and here you will have to say yourself in your freedom,

00:49:39.631 --> 00:49:45.090
Mother please give me pure knowledge.

00:49:45.124 --> 00:49:49.660
Please say it six times because this centre has got six petals.

00:50:19.205 --> 00:50:21.317
Now when you say that

00:50:21.358 --> 00:50:25.995
your kundalini has started rising

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:30.067
and you have to open your higher centres with your confidence.

00:50:44.539 --> 00:50:48.892
So you put your right hand on the upper portion of your abdomen.

00:50:53.275 --> 00:50:55.334
upper portion of your abdomen.

00:50:58.445 --> 00:51:00.752
Now here

00:51:01.708 --> 00:51:06.682
you have to say with full confidence ten times,

00:51:08.095 --> 00:51:12.689
Mother I am my own master.

00:51:26.329 --> 00:51:29.495
Now one has to realise

00:51:29.889 --> 00:51:34.980
that the most important truth

00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:38.246
about you is that you are the spirit.

00:51:45.725 --> 00:51:48.598
You are not this body.

00:51:51.615 --> 00:51:54.321
You are not this mind.

00:51:56.236 --> 00:52:00.195
You are not these imaginations and emotions.

00:52:03.263 --> 00:52:06.335
You are not your conditionings.

00:52:08.810 --> 00:52:11.136
You are not your ego

00:52:13.027 --> 00:52:15.666
but you are pure spirit.

00:52:19.227 --> 00:52:22.380
So please put your right hand on your heart

00:52:25.751 --> 00:52:30.059
and here with full confidence say, twelve times,

00:52:30.073 --> 00:52:33.770
“Mother I am the Spirit”.

00:52:48.548 --> 00:52:51.794
Now one has to know that Divine

00:52:52.310 --> 00:52:58.724
is the power of bliss and joy.

00:53:06.543 --> 00:53:08.989
It is the power of love,

00:53:11.817 --> 00:53:15.984
but above all it is the power of forgiveness

00:53:20.712 --> 00:53:24.725
and what mistakes can you commit

00:53:24.779 --> 00:53:29.737
that this great power of forgiveness cannot dissolve it.

00:53:48.682 --> 00:53:53.175
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck

00:53:53.200 --> 00:53:58.182
and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.

00:54:06.708 --> 00:54:09.647
Here with full confidence say,

00:54:09.663 --> 00:54:11.955
“Mother I am not guilty”.

00:54:11.980 --> 00:54:13.955
Please say this sixteen times.

00:54:28.476 --> 00:54:31.547
Please say it from your heart.

00:54:35.244 --> 00:54:38.703
Believe Me that you are not guilty.

00:54:41.140 --> 00:54:43.877
Let your kundalini judge.
Let God judge you.

00:54:43.891 --> 00:54:45.964
Don’t judge yourself.

00:54:56.520 --> 00:55:03.016
Now put your right hand on your forehead

00:55:03.061 --> 00:55:07.031
and left hand towards Me and put down your head.

00:55:14.511 --> 00:55:16.372
Press it on both the sides.

00:55:18.967 --> 00:55:24.073
Here you have to say Mother I forgive everyone.

00:55:30.562 --> 00:55:34.340
Some may say that it is very difficult

00:55:34.365 --> 00:55:37.905
but whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

00:55:37.932 --> 00:55:40.288
you don’t do anything.

00:55:50.785 --> 00:55:54.437
So please don’t play into wrong hands

00:55:57.125 --> 00:56:02.506
and say with full heart,
“Mother I forgive everyone”.

00:56:11.858 --> 00:56:15.298
Now take back your hand

00:56:15.307 --> 00:56:17.592
on backside of your head

00:56:17.617 --> 00:56:20.019
and put the head backwards on it.

00:56:27.705 --> 00:56:30.364
Here now you say

00:56:32.066 --> 00:56:37.117
without counting your mistakes,
without feeling guilty,

00:56:41.978 --> 00:56:44.104
just for your satisfaction

00:56:44.131 --> 00:56:46.137
you say O Divine

00:56:46.164 --> 00:56:49.792
if I have done any mistakes please forgive me.

00:57:03.927 --> 00:57:08.060
Now stretch your hand

00:57:10.528 --> 00:57:14.160
and put the centre of your palm

00:57:14.185 --> 00:57:16.035
on top of your head

00:57:20.776 --> 00:57:22.589
and press it hard.

00:57:24.257 --> 00:57:26.876
Push back your fingers please

00:57:29.595 --> 00:57:31.468
and bend your head.

00:57:33.432 --> 00:57:38.697
Now move it seven times very slowly clockwise.

00:57:45.553 --> 00:57:50.312
Here again I cannot force self realisation on you all.

00:57:55.490 --> 00:57:58.098
So you have to say seven times,

00:57:58.123 --> 00:58:02.143
“Mother please give  me my realisation”.

00:59:07.859 --> 00:59:10.259
Now take down your hands

00:59:11.122 --> 00:59:12.182
and watch Me.

00:59:13.522 --> 00:59:15.928
Without thoughts you can watch Me.

00:59:16.452 --> 00:59:18.478
You can watch Me without thoughts.

00:59:22.206 --> 00:59:25.779
Now put your right hand towards Me

00:59:27.864 --> 00:59:30.984
and bend your head and see

00:59:31.048 --> 00:59:34.469
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:59:41.472 --> 00:59:44.986
Some people get it hot.
Doesn’t matter we’ll correct it.

00:59:52.073 --> 00:59:54.846
Now put the left hand towards Me

00:59:54.873 --> 00:59:57.974
and put the right hand to see if there’s a cool breeze coming.

01:00:06.002 --> 01:00:10.188
Now put the right hand once again

01:00:11.032 --> 01:00:13.451
and put the left hand and see bend your head.

01:00:19.850 --> 01:00:24.064
Now you push back your hands and ask a question,

01:00:27.809 --> 01:00:32.468
“Mother is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

01:00:38.930 --> 01:00:44.524
“Mother is this the power of God’s love?"

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:52.806
Ask this question three times.

01:00:54.417 --> 01:00:56.903
You can ask, “Is this the ruh (spirit)

01:00:57.307 --> 01:00:59.906
which is all pervading?”

01:01:09.523 --> 01:01:11.549
Put down your hands please.

01:01:15.277 --> 01:01:18.669
All those who have felt

01:01:18.712 --> 01:01:22.971
cool breeze in their hands or on their head, cool or hot

01:01:26.159 --> 01:01:28.532
please raise both your hands.

01:01:28.708 --> 01:01:30.108
Both your hands.

01:01:32.515 --> 01:01:33.854
Can you feel?

01:01:34.283 --> 01:01:35.749
Just feel on his head.

01:01:35.767 --> 01:01:39.968
Some sahaja yogis just feel [UNCLEAR]

01:01:39.993 --> 01:01:42.110
where is the other one cold.

01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:44.160
disappear

01:01:47.632 --> 01:01:49.056
He says simply heat.

01:01:49.477 --> 01:01:51.716
Simply heat, yeah [UNCLEAR] because of liver

01:01:51.743 --> 01:01:52.880
I knew he had.

01:01:52.905 --> 01:01:57.737
You put your left hand on your liver, this side.

01:01:58.494 --> 01:02:00.622
More on the liver side.

01:02:01.542 --> 01:02:02.592
on this side.

01:02:02.626 --> 01:02:04.299
more on the left, right.

01:02:07.752 --> 01:02:09.572
Now it will cool down.

01:02:09.588 --> 01:02:11.234
It’s because of  liver.

01:02:11.250 --> 01:02:14.536
Again can I see those who have felt the cool breeze.

01:02:14.540 --> 01:02:17.586
Both the hands, those who have felt the cool breeze.

01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:24.448
[UNCLEAR]

01:02:24.462 --> 01:02:27.393
It’s true. You people are really great.

01:02:27.481 --> 01:02:30.614
Most of you have felt it.
May God bless you.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.213
Those who have not felt also can feel it.

01:02:40.570 --> 01:02:42.683
Come this side,

01:02:42.708 --> 01:02:45.194
and we’ll work it out from there.

01:02:45.304 --> 01:02:46.770
Have you got it now?

01:02:46.777 --> 01:02:48.236
You feel it now?

01:02:48.277 --> 01:02:50.224
Are you feeling cool?

01:02:50.249 --> 01:02:52.428
Put it left to right is all right.

01:02:52.453 --> 01:02:55.117
Too much of thinking.
