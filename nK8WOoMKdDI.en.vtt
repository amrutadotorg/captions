00:00:06.584 --> 00:00:16.004
And to understand also in a very gross way,
we can say, to have Ganesha tattva (Principle)

00:00:16.084 --> 00:00:21.850
developed in you, you must eat things which
are emitting Ganesha Principle.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.728
Like the Chana, like, I have found out, the
Hazelnut.

00:00:25.809 --> 00:00:32.543
Then you can see that you should use a lot
of these lemons, is a good idea.

00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:36.760
All these give you a good Ganesha Tattva.

00:00:55.088 --> 00:01:01.217
So all these things should be used, and
there are many other things one can see that,

00:01:01.297 --> 00:01:05.022
which help you to develop your Ganesha Tattva.

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:08.596
But the highest of all is to control your
eyes.

00:01:08.596 --> 00:01:13.764
Not to see anything that is tempting.

00:01:26.269 --> 00:01:28.800
So put your eyes on the ground.

00:01:31.634 --> 00:01:36.154
Just watch your eyes when another sex arrives,

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:41.390
how do you look at that person, with greed, with lust.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.765
And if you understand that, then you will start
clearing your eyes very well.

00:02:06.398 --> 00:02:11.774
Another thing is physically you
should try to do one or two exercises

00:02:11.854 --> 00:02:18.200
to be able to put yourself flat on
the Mother Earth, because that helps.

00:02:27.148 --> 00:02:32.331
So before doing the meditation to Shri
Ganesha, you must first do that exercise,

00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:39.911
to loosen the muscles so that you should
touch the Mother Earth in a more flat way.

00:02:52.778 --> 00:02:54.586
It will help.
