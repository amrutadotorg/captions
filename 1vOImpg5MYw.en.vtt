00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:43.409
It is a very unique opportunity, I think,

00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:46.867
for Me to meet you again in Bombay

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.533
when you are all leaving this country,

00:03:54.075 --> 00:03:57.825
and this kind of a special type of a puja

00:03:57.825 --> 00:03:59.825
that we are having today.

00:04:00.533 --> 00:04:05.451
This is the puja done to the sun,

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:10.075
and is called as Makar Sankrant.

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:17.867
"Makar" is the tropic of Capricorn,

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:19.825
Capricorn is Makar.

00:04:20.742 --> 00:04:24.492
So now the sun is moving from the tropic of Capricorn

00:04:25.992 --> 00:04:29.034
towards the tropic of Cancer,

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.617
and is always a fixed date because it's a,

00:04:33.075 --> 00:04:34.700
it has something to do with the sun.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.825
This is the only date which is fixed in the Indian calendar,

00:04:37.825 --> 00:04:40.992
because they have to deal with the sun.

00:04:41.034 --> 00:04:42.867
But this time, I don't know why, what has happened

00:04:42.867 --> 00:04:44.867
that they have put it on the fifteenth

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.617
of this month - it's always the fourteenth.

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:52.909
Now today is, they are changing,

00:04:54.284 --> 00:04:58.409
I would say that the seasons are going to be changed.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:04.950
We've got six months when this moves,

00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.326
sun moves towards the southern hemisphere

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.950
and makes it warm, and it comes to the northern hemisphere

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:16.825
from tomorrow.

00:05:17.075 --> 00:05:21.909
So today is the last day, which we say that

00:05:22.201 --> 00:05:24.575
is the day which is the coldest day,

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:28.617
according to Indian understanding.

00:05:29.075 --> 00:05:31.909
After this the heat will start growing

00:05:32.491 --> 00:05:36.825
and all the - we can do anything that is auspicious,

00:05:36.825 --> 00:05:41.700
any auspicious things can be done after this puja is over,

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:44.034
during the summer-time.

00:05:44.034 --> 00:05:46.533
Though it's very hot in summer,

00:05:46.783 --> 00:05:50.367
still people wants the sun to rule us

00:05:50.658 --> 00:05:52.284
and to give us warmth because,

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:58.409
because of him only all the fields and all the vegetables,

00:05:58.409 --> 00:06:01.201
all the fruits, everything grows.

00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:06.284
And that's why when the six months the sun is not here,

00:06:06.492 --> 00:06:08.159
we call it as "Sankrant,"

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:10.451
meaning a "calamity" in a way.

00:06:11.201 --> 00:06:13.326
That is when of course in the,

00:06:13.326 --> 00:06:19.201
in the European countries or say in England or America,

00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:24.533
it is a calamity at that time when the sun is not there.

00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:29.867
But even here it is regarded as a time today,

00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:33.451
it's the day that the end of the Sankrant,

00:06:33.658 --> 00:06:35.992
means the end of the calamity is over.

00:06:37.617 --> 00:06:40.075
And they give something sweet to eat

00:06:40.451 --> 00:06:44.201
which is also mixed with sesame seeds,

00:06:44.992 --> 00:06:47.491
because sesame seed is heat-giving.

00:06:47.783 --> 00:06:52.367
So today being the coldest day they want to give sesame seed,

00:06:52.617 --> 00:06:56.117
also want you to retain the heat

00:06:56.367 --> 00:06:59.533
and to adjust yourself to the heat that's coming up.

00:06:59.825 --> 00:07:02.533
This is all thought of in a way,

00:07:02.533 --> 00:07:03.867
in a very gross level,

00:07:03.867 --> 00:07:05.326
on a very gross level,

00:07:05.326 --> 00:07:08.867
that we should keep the people warm enough.

00:07:09.117 --> 00:07:11.075
Also it is said that

00:07:11.326 --> 00:07:17.409
the warmth of love should be expressed at this time

00:07:17.409 --> 00:07:20.617
for people, because it is the coldest day.

00:07:20.617 --> 00:07:24.451
So they say that "We give you this special thing for you

00:07:24.658 --> 00:07:27.533
to say something sweet" - that is "goad goad bola"

00:07:27.533 --> 00:07:29.409
- means "you say something sweet to us."

00:07:30.492 --> 00:07:34.117
And the people who live in warm countries are sweeter people

00:07:34.367 --> 00:07:37.201
than the people who live in colder places,

00:07:37.533 --> 00:07:41.075
because the nature is rather very unkind to them.

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:43.326
I don't blame them for their temperament,

00:07:43.658 --> 00:07:46.075
because the nature is so unkind.

00:07:46.491 --> 00:07:48.409
In India you can live anywhere:

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:50.242
you can live under a tree,

00:07:50.825 --> 00:07:53.409
you can live in a forest,

00:07:53.409 --> 00:07:55.658
anywhere you can live quite happily,

00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:59.658
as long as there is water to drink and water to bathe.

00:08:00.034 --> 00:08:03.783
And there's not such a problem as

00:08:04.034 --> 00:08:06.700
we have to face in the other parts of the world,

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:08.825
where if you have to go out of the house

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:12.491
you take about fifteen, twenty minutes to dress yourself up.

00:08:12.491 --> 00:08:14.409
Here you just can walk out of the house,

00:08:14.409 --> 00:08:17.409
you can keep your houses open during the summer-time,

00:08:17.783 --> 00:08:20.242
and there's no problem of any kind

00:08:20.491 --> 00:08:22.409
as far as the nature is concerned.

00:08:22.409 --> 00:08:27.117
Nature becomes very kind during summer-time here because

00:08:27.367 --> 00:08:31.950
the trees are lush and lot of greenery,

00:08:32.242 --> 00:08:35.242
people feel very happy during that time,

00:08:35.575 --> 00:08:44.284
and all the activity becomes more with the sun's energy.

00:08:46.409 --> 00:08:50.075
But in the West as you have seen that the sun is much less.

00:08:50.491 --> 00:08:51.658
Because of that,

00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:53.575
people keep more to their houses,

00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:56.159
to artificial heating or other heatings,

00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:58.492
and the doors are closed,

00:08:58.950 --> 00:09:00.409
the hearts are closed,

00:09:01.075 --> 00:09:04.491
and it's difficult for them to

00:09:06.575 --> 00:09:08.492
communicate with other people.

00:09:09.451 --> 00:09:13.825
As you go down south more in your countries also,

00:09:14.075 --> 00:09:16.075
you'll find people are warmer,

00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:18.284
simpler,

00:09:21.326 --> 00:09:24.159
very hospitable.

00:09:24.867 --> 00:09:29.533
With the sun you get the heart which is very open heart,

00:09:29.867 --> 00:09:33.533
and a kind of a inviting heart.

00:09:33.909 --> 00:09:37.242
Now if you see on the Sahaja Yoga style,

00:09:37.491 --> 00:09:39.825
the sun line is the right side

00:09:39.825 --> 00:09:43.326
and the moon, moon is the left side.

00:09:43.992 --> 00:09:45.491
On the moon line

00:09:45.742 --> 00:09:49.034
one can desire but cannot act.

00:09:50.117 --> 00:09:52.284
Apart from that, on the moon line

00:09:52.284 --> 00:09:55.242
if you go too far it can be destructive.

00:09:55.658 --> 00:09:58.367
Because if you sit in the house doing nothing

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.409
- and also these days there's unemployment, say for example,

00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:08.242
no work - then you start thinking too much,

00:10:08.242 --> 00:10:13.909
and this thinking is just the desire energy working out,

00:10:13.909 --> 00:10:15.367
no action.

00:10:15.575 --> 00:10:17.367
And without the action

00:10:17.367 --> 00:10:19.950
this energy can become very destructive.

00:10:20.409 --> 00:10:22.909
That is why we find that people,

00:10:22.909 --> 00:10:24.909
they say that "empty mind,

00:10:25.159 --> 00:10:30.909
empty mind is the devil's workshop."

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.117
Where people have, do not act,

00:10:34.783 --> 00:10:36.783
when the action doesn't take place,

00:10:36.783 --> 00:10:39.159
then it can be quite destructive...

00:10:47.409 --> 00:10:51.658
So the whole situation is different

00:10:51.658 --> 00:10:53.367
in a country which is warm,

00:10:53.367 --> 00:10:55.700
and a country which is not warm.

00:10:56.491 --> 00:10:59.909
But in a country where it is very warm also,

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.284
like Africa,

00:11:01.284 --> 00:11:04.700
there are complications due to too much of heat.

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.825
Like we have the tropic of -

00:11:11.658 --> 00:11:14.117
mean the equator passing through,

00:11:14.367 --> 00:11:17.242
and it heats up that area so much

00:11:17.242 --> 00:11:21.533
that it becomes full of jungles,

00:11:21.533 --> 00:11:24.491
very high trees and tall trees;

00:11:24.491 --> 00:11:28.491
and the whole place is covered with foliage so much

00:11:29.034 --> 00:11:30.909
that there's no possibility

00:11:31.825 --> 00:11:37.242
for any sunshine to penetrate through,

00:11:38.451 --> 00:11:40.117
and it's quite dark,

00:11:40.409 --> 00:11:41.783
it's full of darkness.

00:11:42.326 --> 00:11:46.201
So that extreme also comes in the same category

00:11:46.451 --> 00:11:48.992
as the extreme of the cold season.

00:11:49.326 --> 00:11:51.201
Now such people live there

00:11:51.451 --> 00:11:55.950
and they, naturally because the sun is less,

00:11:56.242 --> 00:11:58.242
so they do not grow much;

00:11:58.492 --> 00:12:01.326
and they can be primitive people

00:12:01.658 --> 00:12:03.867
and they can be quite aggressive,

00:12:03.867 --> 00:12:06.617
like they learn things from the animals

00:12:06.617 --> 00:12:09.451
and they could be quite aggressive.

00:12:09.950 --> 00:12:12.533
So the balance has to be struck,

00:12:13.117 --> 00:12:14.783
and the balance is that,

00:12:15.117 --> 00:12:22.242
that we should desire and act.

00:12:22.617 --> 00:12:27.950
But the trouble is in human atmosphere

00:12:28.242 --> 00:12:31.451
there is a division of labor, I think,

00:12:31.867 --> 00:12:36.742
that one part of the country is thinking,

00:12:36.742 --> 00:12:40.492
another part of the country is acting.

00:12:41.451 --> 00:12:44.326
Under these circumstances nothing works out.

00:12:44.783 --> 00:12:48.867
So a balance has to be struck where

00:12:49.201 --> 00:12:52.409
you have the Sushumna working out.

00:12:52.409 --> 00:12:55.867
Now the Sushumna Nadi is the one where

00:12:57.409 --> 00:13:00.242
one would say is the equator - it's not,

00:13:00.242 --> 00:13:01.617
is not the equator,

00:13:01.617 --> 00:13:05.326
but is the axis of the Mother Earth.

00:13:05.658 --> 00:13:08.658
Axis of the Mother Earth is the Sushumna,

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:10.658
and that has to act;

00:13:10.658 --> 00:13:13.742
and when it comes to that axis then we should understand that we have to be on our axis.

00:13:15.783 --> 00:13:19.658
So we are on the axis,it is the one that balances.

00:13:19.909 --> 00:13:24.367
Actually there is, there is, there is nothing

00:13:24.367 --> 00:13:26.242
like a big pole

00:13:26.242 --> 00:13:29.367
inside the Mother Earth which we can call it as an axis.

00:13:29.825 --> 00:13:33.575
There is nothing that is material

00:13:33.575 --> 00:13:36.950
inside the Mother Earth that we can call it as an axis,

00:13:36.950 --> 00:13:38.575
but it's the energy force

00:13:38.575 --> 00:13:41.159
which acts in such a manner

00:13:41.159 --> 00:13:45.909
that the Earth moves with such tremendous speed

00:13:45.909 --> 00:13:49.242
when the cosmos is all spread out so much.

00:13:49.575 --> 00:13:55.097
It not only moves but it creates day and night for us,

00:13:55.191 --> 00:13:58.775
so that day-time we can work and night-time we can sleep,

00:13:58.775 --> 00:14:00.441
to give us a balance.

00:14:00.983 --> 00:14:04.982
Only also it moves in such a manner round the sun

00:14:05.191 --> 00:14:11.525
that half of the countries get the sun

00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.441
during the summer-time,

00:14:13.441 --> 00:14:17.858
and half of them get it during the winter-time.

00:14:18.316 --> 00:14:21.733
That's the axis that acts and works out everything.

00:14:21.982 --> 00:14:22.900
Apart from that,

00:14:22.900 --> 00:14:27.650
this axis keeps all the distances necessary

00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:32.274
from other planets and other moving bodies in the cosmos.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:36.983
This axis is the intelligence of the Mother Earth.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:43.066
It is not only the intelligence but it is the fragrance,

00:14:43.525 --> 00:14:47.900
and apart from, it is the Sushumna Nadi,

00:14:47.900 --> 00:14:49.983
you can say, of the Mother Earth.

00:14:50.441 --> 00:14:54.441
Now through this axis only all these swayambhus

00:14:54.775 --> 00:14:59.525
and all these great happenings of earthquakes

00:14:59.525 --> 00:15:01.441
and all that takes place.

00:15:01.775 --> 00:15:04.191
This axis is the one which moves.

00:15:04.441 --> 00:15:07.274
It's an energy, we can call it axis as the energy,

00:15:07.858 --> 00:15:12.149
moves the lava into different directions

00:15:12.817 --> 00:15:20.191
and pierces through different areas to create earthquakes,

00:15:20.483 --> 00:15:23.024
and also to have

00:15:27.817 --> 00:15:30.692
... volcanoes, volcanoes.

00:15:31.024 --> 00:15:36.692
And all these things happen because the axis has sense

00:15:36.692 --> 00:15:37.942
what is to be done.

00:15:38.274 --> 00:15:41.024
This axis is the one that loves us.

00:15:41.483 --> 00:15:44.483
Because of this axis we,

00:15:44.817 --> 00:15:46.692
we have seasons.

00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:50.358
The seasons are created beautifully to give us

00:15:50.358 --> 00:15:53.441
different, different varieties of food

00:15:53.441 --> 00:15:55.942
and varieties of things.

00:15:56.733 --> 00:16:00.942
The heat of the Mother Earth if it is lost,

00:16:01.149 --> 00:16:04.483
then we'll have nothing on this Earth,

00:16:04.483 --> 00:16:09.149
it'll be all frozen and there will be all snow,

00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:12.024
and we'll have no food, nothing,

00:16:12.316 --> 00:16:14.983
and it will be like moon living here.

00:16:15.817 --> 00:16:18.149
Now it has been specially created:

00:16:19.024 --> 00:16:22.108
first the Mother Earth when it was created

00:16:22.608 --> 00:16:25.024
through the heat of the sun,

00:16:26.358 --> 00:16:29.817
so we can say that the sun is the father of the Mother Earth.

00:16:30.233 --> 00:16:34.024
Then she was brought very close to the moon

00:16:34.566 --> 00:16:37.108
so it cooled down, absolutely it cooled down,

00:16:37.108 --> 00:16:38.692
it was all snow.

00:16:38.942 --> 00:16:42.608
Then it was brought closer to the sun

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:45.483
and moved at a point where

00:16:45.483 --> 00:16:48.233
life could start working,

00:16:48.483 --> 00:16:51.692
and that's how the whole thing was organized beautifully

00:16:51.983 --> 00:16:54.900
to make life grow in that area.

00:16:55.108 --> 00:16:57.108
Now when the life started growing,

00:16:57.108 --> 00:17:01.817
gradually we know that how the carbon was formed.

00:17:01.982 --> 00:17:05.400
Now the carbon is formed by the same axis,

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.608
because there's heat in the axis,

00:17:07.608 --> 00:17:10.733
the energy of heat that converts

00:17:14.608 --> 00:17:18.982
the plants into carbon.

00:17:19.358 --> 00:17:21.858
Now this carbon is, later on

00:17:22.108 --> 00:17:24.692
forms the basis for,

00:17:24.692 --> 00:17:27.400
we can say,

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:33.982
for the production of carbohydrates,

00:17:33.982 --> 00:17:35.233
you can say,

00:17:35.233 --> 00:17:37.817
or all organic matter.

00:17:38.274 --> 00:17:42.149
But to create life we had to have another help,

00:17:42.149 --> 00:17:43.733
is the nitrogen;

00:17:43.982 --> 00:17:47.274
and this nitrogen was also, you'll be surprised to know,

00:17:47.274 --> 00:17:51.400
that was created by the same axis, by its movement.

00:17:51.817 --> 00:17:54.274
And when it created this nitrogen,

00:17:54.274 --> 00:17:56.983
the nitrogen gave us the amino acids;

00:17:57.274 --> 00:18:00.692
and when the amino acids were created within us,

00:18:01.108 --> 00:18:08.024
then we started our lives from amoeba and all that.

00:18:08.024 --> 00:18:12.525
Of course this was done in the ocean,

00:18:12.817 --> 00:18:15.566
because in the ocean with the movement,

00:18:15.858 --> 00:18:18.982
nitrogen was created and life was created,

00:18:19.233 --> 00:18:22.149
and then through the ocean it's emitted out,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.400
and that's how we have amino acids.

00:18:25.733 --> 00:18:29.108
With the amino acids, the formation of amino acids

00:18:29.483 --> 00:18:32.108
gave us the combinations and permutations,

00:18:32.358 --> 00:18:33.400
different lives.

00:18:34.149 --> 00:18:36.692
So in the whole evolutionary process

00:18:36.692 --> 00:18:40.692
the Mother Earth has played a very big part through her axis.

00:18:41.024 --> 00:18:43.149
In the same way in human beings,

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:46.274
the axis is the most important thing.

00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:50.733
That's the main principle of life we have got, is our axis.

00:18:51.024 --> 00:18:53.400
We have to stand on our axis.

00:18:53.817 --> 00:18:56.233
Those who do not stand on their axis,

00:18:56.233 --> 00:18:59.608
stand more towards the left or towards the right,

00:18:59.858 --> 00:19:04.149
are capable of complete destruction;

00:19:04.566 --> 00:19:07.274
because either they will be destroyed by

00:19:07.274 --> 00:19:11.024
too much of right side or too much of left side.

00:19:11.274 --> 00:19:15.858
So our axis has to be properly dealt with.

00:19:16.149 --> 00:19:19.108
Now those people who do not have a proper axis

00:19:19.692 --> 00:19:22.483
can have problems of different chakras,

00:19:22.858 --> 00:19:28.233
of different kind of quality in a person.

00:19:29.483 --> 00:19:32.441
A person who stretches his axis too much,

00:19:32.441 --> 00:19:34.483
puts back his head like this,

00:19:34.483 --> 00:19:36.733
is a person who is very right-sided

00:19:36.733 --> 00:19:39.441
and creates problem with his ego;

00:19:39.441 --> 00:19:41.817
and the one who absolutely bends down

00:19:41.817 --> 00:19:46.733
like a slavish person also is a person

00:19:46.733 --> 00:19:49.274
who goes towards his destructiveness.

00:19:49.274 --> 00:19:54.149
Now there's a big problem between these two types of people,

00:19:54.483 --> 00:19:56.483
one trying to dominate another,

00:19:56.483 --> 00:20:00.733
and when they start dominating another person

00:20:00.733 --> 00:20:02.858
they actually destroy themselves,

00:20:02.858 --> 00:20:05.900
as well as destroy the ones whom they are dominating.

00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:07.233
For example now,

00:20:07.233 --> 00:20:11.733
we have seen that we had

00:20:12.483 --> 00:20:14.817
Britishers who came here and ruled us.

00:20:15.024 --> 00:20:18.358
We have seen the French went and ruled some other people,

00:20:18.525 --> 00:20:20.191
then there are Portuguese who went and ruled

00:20:20.191 --> 00:20:21.441
some other people.

00:20:21.942 --> 00:20:24.358
But everything that they did to dominate

00:20:24.358 --> 00:20:26.441
and all that has double reactions.

00:20:26.692 --> 00:20:29.024
First of all by their domination, say,

00:20:29.024 --> 00:20:31.108
Indians became very slavish,

00:20:31.608 --> 00:20:34.692
Indians became - even today they are extremely slavish,

00:20:34.983 --> 00:20:37.566
and they do not have that independent axis

00:20:37.566 --> 00:20:38.817
as they should have.

00:20:38.817 --> 00:20:41.108
Extremely slavish people they are.

00:20:41.358 --> 00:20:43.316
I mean, especially I've seen in the West,

00:20:43.316 --> 00:20:45.608
I am surprised when the Indians go from here,

00:20:45.608 --> 00:20:47.692
I find they are so very slavish.

00:20:47.692 --> 00:20:52.149
They try to sort of do all kinds of slavish acts

00:20:52.149 --> 00:20:54.900
to please the white-skinned people.

00:20:56.024 --> 00:21:00.983
The white skin became sort of a very adorable stuff in India.

00:21:02.483 --> 00:21:06.358
That added to the ego of the whites,

00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.692
added to the ego of the whites,

00:21:08.692 --> 00:21:10.900
and today you see what's happening is

00:21:11.108 --> 00:21:12.983
all that ego is destroying them.

00:21:13.441 --> 00:21:16.441
They are on the verge of destruction because of their ego.

00:21:16.692 --> 00:21:20.024
So it is so unnatural and it is so superficial.

00:21:20.358 --> 00:21:23.608
One has to understand that what is the best

00:21:23.608 --> 00:21:25.983
within a human being is his axis,

00:21:25.983 --> 00:21:27.942
and everybody has an axis,

00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:31.608
and one must respect the axis of every person.

00:21:32.024 --> 00:21:35.983
In Sahaja Yoga I don't know you by your faces so much;

00:21:36.483 --> 00:21:38.692
I know you by your chakras,

00:21:38.692 --> 00:21:39.942
by your Sushumna,

00:21:39.942 --> 00:21:41.566
what sort of a Sushumna you have.

00:21:41.817 --> 00:21:44.942
If you have a deep Sushumna, I know you as a deep person.

00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:47.358
If you have a superficial Sushumna,

00:21:47.358 --> 00:21:50.775
I know you as a person with a very superficial

00:21:50.775 --> 00:21:52.983
type of a Sushumna.

00:21:53.483 --> 00:21:57.441
And even if you make up something

00:21:57.441 --> 00:22:00.900
by sort of being very nice or good,

00:22:01.149 --> 00:22:03.108
or talking about Sahaja Yoga

00:22:03.108 --> 00:22:05.358
or knowing too much about Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:05.358 --> 00:22:09.566
and saying things which will baffle normally anyone

00:22:09.817 --> 00:22:11.942
as if you are masters of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:11.942 --> 00:22:13.983
I know how deep you are.

00:22:15.358 --> 00:22:17.024
So the depth on the axis

00:22:17.024 --> 00:22:19.358
is more important than anything else.

00:22:19.608 --> 00:22:23.108
Your axis has to be very deep.

00:22:23.274 --> 00:22:24.858
Now you will say that "Mother,

00:22:24.858 --> 00:22:29.149
the axis is the same as it is, so how can it be deep?"

00:22:29.441 --> 00:22:33.608
So the, in the axis as you see is made in human beings,

00:22:33.858 --> 00:22:39.358
is like a three-and-a-half coiled paper-like thing,

00:22:40.024 --> 00:22:43.483
and the inside of it is the Brahma Nadi.

00:22:44.483 --> 00:22:46.983
The Brahma Nadi is a very, very small little,

00:22:47.274 --> 00:22:51.358
we can call a very, very hair-like thing

00:22:51.358 --> 00:22:56.358
where only a hair-like Kundalini can pass through.

00:22:56.608 --> 00:23:00.441
But when the person is deep this Brahma Nadi is bigger,

00:23:00.692 --> 00:23:02.149
and all the rest of them

00:23:02.149 --> 00:23:07.108
which are coiled into each otherare smaller;

00:23:07.108 --> 00:23:10.024
while the people who are not deep, their outside

00:23:12.692 --> 00:23:16.149
what you call the foldings are bigger

00:23:16.149 --> 00:23:19.024
than the inside small thing.

00:23:19.274 --> 00:23:22.942
Now such people could be apparently very dynamic,

00:23:22.942 --> 00:23:25.817
may look very intelligent, may look very smart,

00:23:26.024 --> 00:23:27.983
may look to be very good-looking

00:23:27.983 --> 00:23:30.233
or whatever it may be outwardly,

00:23:31.024 --> 00:23:33.608
but inwardly they are not deep.

00:23:34.024 --> 00:23:35.983
Inwardly if they are deep,

00:23:36.233 --> 00:23:39.858
their whole attitude is beautiful.

00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:42.149
They are very joy-giving people,

00:23:42.692 --> 00:23:44.274
they are very joy-giving.

00:23:44.566 --> 00:23:48.983
And the more if you meet a person of another kind

00:23:49.358 --> 00:23:52.441
he may look joyous, he may try to give you joy,

00:23:52.441 --> 00:23:55.817
but the joy won't be really that deep;

00:23:56.024 --> 00:23:58.566
it would be like a joy-killing.

00:24:00.566 --> 00:24:04.983
So it is important for us to make our axis deeper,

00:24:05.441 --> 00:24:09.817
and that is where we lack the proper assiduity,

00:24:10.024 --> 00:24:14.483
the proper effort we have to put in.

00:24:15.149 --> 00:24:20.149
Now some people have automatically a very deep axis,

00:24:20.733 --> 00:24:25.817
and some people have very, very what you should say,

00:24:26.108 --> 00:24:30.817
a very constricted type of the axis.

00:24:31.233 --> 00:24:33.483
This axis has to be grown.

00:24:33.483 --> 00:24:35.858
Now when you come for My puja and all that

00:24:35.858 --> 00:24:37.733
I do expand it, I agree,

00:24:37.733 --> 00:24:41.483
but it is temporary thing.

00:24:41.817 --> 00:24:46.566
To retain it at that point one has to work at home,

00:24:46.817 --> 00:24:48.817
in the collective also.

00:24:48.817 --> 00:24:54.024
One has to work very much at home with meditation.

00:24:54.733 --> 00:24:57.024
But it should be done seriously.

00:24:57.274 --> 00:24:59.233
It should not be just a joke,

00:24:59.608 --> 00:25:00.817
to be frivolous,

00:25:01.024 --> 00:25:03.483
to be stupid - that's not the way.

00:25:03.483 --> 00:25:07.358
It should be done very seriously, in the meaning

00:25:07.358 --> 00:25:10.149
that it is a devoted task you have taken,

00:25:10.566 --> 00:25:13.358
it's a meditative thing;

00:25:13.733 --> 00:25:16.608
it's a prayer to God we can call it,

00:25:16.858 --> 00:25:18.608
it's a puja to God.

00:25:20.274 --> 00:25:22.983
Is to be done with that reverence,

00:25:23.566 --> 00:25:30.233
because reverence is the key of achievement.

00:25:31.441 --> 00:25:34.483
If you have no reverence about yourself

00:25:34.483 --> 00:25:36.274
and no reverence of others,

00:25:36.274 --> 00:25:38.233
then it cannot be done.

00:25:38.233 --> 00:25:41.733
But first you must have reverence for your own life.

00:25:41.983 --> 00:25:43.566
"What am I doing with my life?

00:25:43.566 --> 00:25:44.858
Where am I wasting it?

00:25:44.858 --> 00:25:45.983
Why should I waste it?

00:25:45.983 --> 00:25:48.149
Why shouldn't I be deep?

00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:50.233
After all, there must be some purpose of my life.

00:25:50.233 --> 00:25:52.983
Am I serving my purpose, am I doing that?"

00:25:53.358 --> 00:25:56.775
All these things if they pop into your head,

00:25:56.775 --> 00:26:00.775
then you will understand it's very easy to fight out your ego,

00:26:00.983 --> 00:26:04.191
because normally on small, small things people fight.

00:26:04.191 --> 00:26:08.358
I've seen that in Sahaja Yoga also people fight on things

00:26:08.358 --> 00:26:12.108
like, I mean which are so useless, absolutely useless.

00:26:12.108 --> 00:26:16.066
To Me it sounds stupid to even mention

00:26:16.066 --> 00:26:18.983
the way people fight over small things and quarrel.

00:26:19.358 --> 00:26:22.775
But a deep person, even if he doesn't speak much,

00:26:22.983 --> 00:26:25.942
even if he doesn't show off much,

00:26:26.191 --> 00:26:28.775
even if he doesn't sit in the front line,

00:26:29.108 --> 00:26:31.650
he expresses himself through his depth,

00:26:31.650 --> 00:26:34.566
because I can work out better through that.

00:26:36.608 --> 00:26:38.983
So to develop this one must meditate,

00:26:38.983 --> 00:26:40.983
important thing is to meditate;

00:26:40.983 --> 00:26:43.733
every day, every day, every day.

00:26:43.733 --> 00:26:45.733
You may not eat your food one day,

00:26:45.733 --> 00:26:47.233
you may not sleep one day,

00:26:47.233 --> 00:26:50.274
you may not go to your office one day,

00:26:50.566 --> 00:26:53.441
you may not do anything that you are doing every day

00:26:53.441 --> 00:26:55.608
- but you must meditate every day.

00:26:55.608 --> 00:26:57.233
That's an important point,

00:26:57.233 --> 00:27:03.942
to develop the central constricted part into a bigger area.

00:27:05.733 --> 00:27:12.233
Now when that happens that you start developing it,

00:27:12.566 --> 00:27:14.900
the first thing you will notice about yourself

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:17.983
that you do not care for any comfort,

00:27:18.942 --> 00:27:21.358
you're not bothered about any,

00:27:23.525 --> 00:27:25.400
any material thing.

00:27:25.858 --> 00:27:28.149
Whatever it is you are above it,

00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:30.400
you just don't bother your head - let it be.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:33.024
You just don't want to put your neck

00:27:33.024 --> 00:27:36.274
into a thing where you do not belong.

00:27:36.858 --> 00:27:38.108
You just get out of it,

00:27:38.108 --> 00:27:39.650
and you think that

00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:43.900
"Oh God, this is too much for me, I just don't care for it."

00:27:44.316 --> 00:27:47.441
So your whole attention now moves inward.

00:27:47.692 --> 00:27:49.858
When the attention starts moving inward

00:27:50.066 --> 00:27:51.858
then it expands more.

00:27:52.066 --> 00:27:55.316
It's the inner part which is called as the Brahma Nadi,

00:27:56.525 --> 00:28:00.191
and starts expanding and expanding.

00:28:00.775 --> 00:28:02.983
Now in small, small things also:

00:28:03.441 --> 00:28:04.900
say for example

00:28:05.817 --> 00:28:09.024
if I have not mentioned somebody

00:28:09.942 --> 00:28:11.942
and mentioned somebody else,

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:14.483
then they feel,

00:28:14.483 --> 00:28:16.858
"Oh, why didn't Mother mention my name?"

00:28:16.858 --> 00:28:20.483
It's too small a thing that it doesn't matter.

00:28:21.483 --> 00:28:25.692
As long as you have a deep axis you are with Me,

00:28:25.692 --> 00:28:29.024
I am with you, absolutely one with each other.

00:28:29.316 --> 00:28:31.650
But these outward things are,

00:28:31.650 --> 00:28:33.900
"Oh, She gave a nice sari to another one,

00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:36.233
She never gave us a sari, She didn't do this,

00:28:36.233 --> 00:28:37.483
didn't do that."

00:28:37.483 --> 00:28:39.983
All those things if it comes to your head,

00:28:39.983 --> 00:28:42.817
that means absolutely it's true

00:28:43.066 --> 00:28:46.483
that there is something lacking in you.

00:28:47.233 --> 00:28:49.066
Or if you try to complain,

00:28:49.066 --> 00:28:51.775
"Oh, I went there, I had to go by a bus

00:28:51.775 --> 00:28:53.775
and I had to stand on this thing,"

00:28:53.775 --> 00:28:56.441
that shows that you are not comforted at all.

00:28:58.775 --> 00:29:01.233
This widening comforts you.

00:29:01.692 --> 00:29:03.900
That's the comforting thing,

00:29:04.316 --> 00:29:07.441
and that really makes you feel so comfortable

00:29:07.441 --> 00:29:12.900
in any circumstance, in any position, in any lifestyle,

00:29:13.358 --> 00:29:19.108
and you do not want to have any other comfort.

00:29:21.817 --> 00:29:24.316
And this one has to develop,

00:29:24.566 --> 00:29:26.316
through meditative effort.

00:29:26.692 --> 00:29:30.525
Secondly is, we have to know that Sahaja Yoga

00:29:30.525 --> 00:29:33.108
as it is today is a collective happening.

00:29:33.942 --> 00:29:36.817
I find especially among Indian men,

00:29:36.817 --> 00:29:39.024
they never do any work with their hands,

00:29:39.024 --> 00:29:40.441
which is a wrong thing.

00:29:40.441 --> 00:29:43.233
Because they don't use their hands at all

00:29:43.483 --> 00:29:45.483
their collectivity is poor, very poor.

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:47.817
Indians have the worst collectivity.

00:29:48.692 --> 00:29:49.983
If you have an ashram,

00:29:49.983 --> 00:29:51.650
I don't know why should we build the ashram,

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:53.316
nobody is going to stay there.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:56.650
They want to have their own houses,

00:29:56.900 --> 00:29:57.982
their own families,

00:29:57.982 --> 00:29:59.566
their own children;

00:29:59.817 --> 00:30:02.316
they are the worst of all for collectivity.

00:30:02.316 --> 00:30:06.316
The reason is, Indian men never do any work with their hands.

00:30:06.775 --> 00:30:10.775
They cannot nail one nail - there are many like that

00:30:11.233 --> 00:30:13.525
- leave alone repairing anything.

00:30:13.817 --> 00:30:17.650
They will stand with their hands on their hips

00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:21.650
and would just tell work to other people, you see.

00:30:21.983 --> 00:30:23.566
There's a Marathi saying,

00:30:23.817 --> 00:30:26.358
a very interesting ....

00:30:26.942 --> 00:30:33.942
that is, "To sit on a camel and to drive the goats."

00:30:35.692 --> 00:30:38.024
So that is very typical of Indian men.

00:30:38.274 --> 00:30:39.692
They cannot repair anything,

00:30:39.692 --> 00:30:41.233
they cannot do anything.

00:30:41.233 --> 00:30:43.817
Now if supposing somebody is spreading something,

00:30:43.817 --> 00:30:45.358
they'll just stand like this, watch,

00:30:45.358 --> 00:30:47.358
they'll never put their hands to it.

00:30:47.358 --> 00:30:50.608
So for every Sahaja yogi it is important

00:30:50.608 --> 00:30:53.149
what we call as shramadaan.

00:30:54.608 --> 00:30:56.817
They have to do some shramadaan.

00:30:57.024 --> 00:31:00.858
"Shramadaan" means the giving of some labor,

00:31:02.817 --> 00:31:05.358
and that is what we lack.

00:31:05.733 --> 00:31:10.982
That even if it comes to that you'd better clean your house,

00:31:10.982 --> 00:31:13.149
you'd better clean the outside of your house,

00:31:13.149 --> 00:31:15.608
try to put some garden around your house,

00:31:15.858 --> 00:31:17.400
try to paint your house,

00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:19.858
do some sort of a work with your hand

00:31:20.066 --> 00:31:23.024
which even if you don't have anything,

00:31:23.024 --> 00:31:27.149
you can even brush your hair or something like that.

00:31:27.149 --> 00:31:31.608
Whatever you think is the easiest you can start with,

00:31:31.608 --> 00:31:33.733
because I don't think people even do that.

00:31:34.233 --> 00:31:35.858
Even they don't shave themselves,

00:31:35.858 --> 00:31:38.358
they get the person to shave them - I mean,

00:31:38.358 --> 00:31:41.274
absolutely lazy lumps as they are.

00:31:41.525 --> 00:31:44.274
Now, but on the contrary

00:31:44.274 --> 00:31:47.233
we see in the West people use their hands.

00:31:47.525 --> 00:31:49.733
Because of that, you see,

00:31:49.982 --> 00:31:52.483
because they can use their hands, they are very collective.

00:31:52.775 --> 00:31:55.733
So they score a point on being collective,

00:31:56.066 --> 00:31:57.858
while the Indians score a point because

00:31:57.858 --> 00:31:59.775
they are Indians and they have a heritage

00:31:59.775 --> 00:32:00.982
and they know what is Kundalini,

00:32:00.982 --> 00:32:03.316
they know about Ganesha, they know everything.

00:32:03.733 --> 00:32:05.525
So they score a point this side.

00:32:05.525 --> 00:32:07.441
So it's the left side is the desire,

00:32:07.441 --> 00:32:08.982
the right side is the action;

00:32:08.982 --> 00:32:11.858
again we come back to the same position where

00:32:11.858 --> 00:32:13.274
we have an imbalance,

00:32:13.274 --> 00:32:15.650
that the action takes place in the West,

00:32:15.982 --> 00:32:20.566
and here is only thinking - "all right, we'll do this"

00:32:20.858 --> 00:32:23.441
- planning. Everything is a planning point.

00:32:23.858 --> 00:32:27.066
Nothing works out. You go on planning, planning, planning.

00:32:27.066 --> 00:32:29.733
Now we are building one single ashram

00:32:29.983 --> 00:32:33.400
in Delhi for the last, I think, ten years.

00:32:35.775 --> 00:32:38.817
It is like Taj Mahal, I tell you!

00:32:42.692 --> 00:32:45.483
And it's so difficult, you see,

00:32:45.900 --> 00:32:48.024
to understand why they have taken so much time

00:32:48.024 --> 00:32:50.483
when it's not a very big place, nothing.

00:32:50.942 --> 00:32:54.692
But it is not only the Sahaja yogis but other factors also,

00:32:54.983 --> 00:32:57.817
because everybody is like that, everything is postponed,

00:32:58.191 --> 00:33:00.483
everything is to be done tomorrow.

00:33:00.483 --> 00:33:01.817
"This we will do tomorrow."

00:33:01.817 --> 00:33:04.817
Then one person will come, another person won't come.

00:33:05.024 --> 00:33:09.483
Like we used to have in the school,

00:33:09.775 --> 00:33:15.775
we would get a sum like that or something to solve that,

00:33:15.775 --> 00:33:18.983
see, there were: one house was built,

00:33:18.983 --> 00:33:22.233
three persons came to work and one ran away.

00:33:22.692 --> 00:33:26.441
Then two persons came to work and one stayed

00:33:26.441 --> 00:33:27.775
and two ran away;

00:33:28.191 --> 00:33:32.024
and then five persons came to work and two persons ran away.

00:33:32.358 --> 00:33:34.650
So how, when will the house be finished?

00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.483
Never!

00:33:37.024 --> 00:33:42.316
With such runaways it can never be finished.

00:33:42.316 --> 00:33:43.483
It's like that.

00:33:43.483 --> 00:33:46.650
So this is what, where we lack collectivity.

00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:49.358
I was saying that all Indians must find out

00:33:49.775 --> 00:33:53.566
some place where they could go and plant something.

00:33:54.024 --> 00:33:56.066
Get hold of some sort of a place

00:33:56.358 --> 00:34:00.191
where they could go and plant some nice banyan trees,

00:34:00.650 --> 00:34:03.441
water it together, work it out together.

00:34:03.775 --> 00:34:05.983
Now the Indian women are that way better.

00:34:05.983 --> 00:34:09.024
They do lot of work as far as the cooking is concerned

00:34:09.024 --> 00:34:10.441
and all that,

00:34:10.441 --> 00:34:12.483
but the other part is missing.

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:14.692
The other part is intelligence,

00:34:14.942 --> 00:34:16.942
it's the other part is to think.

00:34:16.942 --> 00:34:19.566
Now if all the time what they are thinking,

00:34:19.566 --> 00:34:22.775
"Oh, my husband likes this, I must cook this for him,"

00:34:22.775 --> 00:34:26.983
and now if the husband has to have a, say,

00:34:26.983 --> 00:34:28.358
a lemon with his food.

00:34:28.358 --> 00:34:29.775
Now there's no lemon in the house.

00:34:29.775 --> 00:34:32.024
This woman would run up and down all over the place

00:34:32.024 --> 00:34:33.900
to get the lemon for the husband,

00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:35.775
otherwise he will not eat the food.

00:34:35.775 --> 00:34:36.483
Doesn't matter,

00:34:36.483 --> 00:34:38.358
once in a while if he doesn't eat it's all right.

00:34:42.441 --> 00:34:43.817
But the women will try,

00:34:43.817 --> 00:34:46.024
because you see they must keep their,

00:34:46.316 --> 00:34:47.483
they understand one thing

00:34:47.483 --> 00:34:49.316
that you must keep their palate all right.

00:34:49.316 --> 00:34:51.775
Then they are quite sensible in India

00:34:51.983 --> 00:34:53.982
because here they're real tigers,

00:34:53.982 --> 00:34:55.775
all the husbands are like tigers,

00:34:55.775 --> 00:34:58.066
so you have to keep them feeding; otherwise you see,

00:34:58.066 --> 00:35:00.692
God knows when the tiger will jump on you.

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:04.441
The other way round in England or America I've seen,

00:35:04.441 --> 00:35:05.900
the husbands are like,

00:35:05.900 --> 00:35:09.191
just like goats and the women are like tigers!

00:35:16.858 --> 00:35:19.692
And the Westernized Indian women also are like that,

00:35:20.066 --> 00:35:21.525
and when they go to West,

00:35:21.525 --> 00:35:24.775
even simple women I've seen they become like tigresses.

00:35:24.983 --> 00:35:27.858
Something surprising how they change immediately

00:35:28.066 --> 00:35:30.650
to the position, even if they may not wear the jeans

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:31.900
and all those things,

00:35:31.900 --> 00:35:33.525
but they become like that.

00:35:33.775 --> 00:35:37.233
So this imbalancing starts in a human being

00:35:37.233 --> 00:35:39.191
when he doesn't understand

00:35:39.191 --> 00:35:41.525
that you have to be a axis of the Mother Earth,

00:35:41.525 --> 00:35:45.274
and neither the Capricorn or the Cancer.

00:35:47.316 --> 00:35:50.108
This balance comes through our depth,

00:35:50.108 --> 00:35:52.316
and that depth has to be improved.

00:35:52.942 --> 00:35:57.858
Not through just by talking about it,

00:35:58.149 --> 00:36:00.024
by talking about Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:00.024 --> 00:36:03.400
but actually seriously doing meditation,

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.149
actually seriously doing meditation.

00:36:10.108 --> 00:36:13.274
Secondly, we must do some collective work.

00:36:13.692 --> 00:36:16.525
Now we have in India, say, architects.

00:36:17.483 --> 00:36:20.149
They have never touched anything with their own hands.

00:36:20.149 --> 00:36:24.274
They are sitting and drawing, you see, that's all - finished.

00:36:24.733 --> 00:36:26.483
Now after the drawing, do what you like.

00:36:26.483 --> 00:36:29.149
And now they have problems, practical problems,

00:36:29.483 --> 00:36:31.650
they cannot nail one nail.

00:36:32.233 --> 00:36:36.692
All are what you call them as white-collar...

00:36:37.233 --> 00:36:40.191
Absolutely useless for any handwork.

00:36:40.525 --> 00:36:42.983
They cannot do any handwork whatsoever.

00:36:43.316 --> 00:36:45.982
Even if they have to lift, say, one of these chairs

00:36:46.233 --> 00:36:49.233
and stretch them, they cannot do it, normally.

00:36:50.191 --> 00:36:53.733
So under these circumstances one has to understand

00:36:53.733 --> 00:36:58.191
that we come from a society which is absolutely ruinous

00:36:58.525 --> 00:37:01.316
as far as collectivity is concerned,

00:37:01.316 --> 00:37:02.983
so let us be collective.

00:37:03.316 --> 00:37:05.566
Let us try to do something collective.

00:37:05.982 --> 00:37:08.983
But the collectivity is so poor in India,

00:37:08.983 --> 00:37:14.400
so poor that even they do not treat their wives nicely.

00:37:15.566 --> 00:37:17.566
They'll not talk to their wife nicely,

00:37:17.566 --> 00:37:19.066
to their children nicely;

00:37:19.066 --> 00:37:23.400
to them it is absolutely adharmic to be kind to their wives.

00:37:26.775 --> 00:37:29.775
Now the other side is that the Western people

00:37:29.775 --> 00:37:32.316
care so much for collectivity that

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:34.650
whatever it is they try to compromise,

00:37:34.982 --> 00:37:37.733
and try to keep the family life all right.

00:37:37.733 --> 00:37:40.525
So it's the two extremes as we have.

00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:45.900
Despite that somehow, thanks to the wisdom of Indian women,

00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:47.982
the family life is going strong.

00:37:48.191 --> 00:37:52.274
But if you see such men in England,

00:37:52.274 --> 00:37:55.108
I can tell you nobody will stand the nonsense

00:37:55.108 --> 00:37:57.858
that Indian men do to their women here.

00:37:57.858 --> 00:38:03.733
Absolutely, it cannot be forgiven the way they behave.

00:38:04.066 --> 00:38:07.274
So the balance between the women and men:

00:38:07.566 --> 00:38:09.692
what is the axis, is the home.

00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:12.233
Home is the axis.

00:38:12.525 --> 00:38:15.316
In the home, what sort of talks you have?

00:38:15.316 --> 00:38:17.066
What do you think about,

00:38:17.066 --> 00:38:18.566
what is your problem?

00:38:18.858 --> 00:38:20.441
Where is your attention,

00:38:20.775 --> 00:38:22.233
what do you discuss?

00:38:22.982 --> 00:38:24.775
That's very important to see.

00:38:25.191 --> 00:38:26.858
In that you'll find out

00:38:27.066 --> 00:38:29.066
what is going on in the family.

00:38:29.066 --> 00:38:31.733
Say you are talking ill of each other,

00:38:32.191 --> 00:38:35.441
if you are telling your child against your husband,

00:38:35.733 --> 00:38:37.733
husband is telling the wife against,

00:38:38.066 --> 00:38:41.316
telling the children about, against the,

00:38:43.858 --> 00:38:46.108
against the husband, like that.

00:38:46.108 --> 00:38:47.817
If it is going on like that,

00:38:48.024 --> 00:38:49.108
then what happens,

00:38:49.108 --> 00:38:52.608
that there cannot be the axis which is all right.

00:38:52.608 --> 00:38:54.817
The axis is love,

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.233
axis is love,

00:38:57.233 --> 00:39:00.942
but not exploitation nor spoiling - it's love.

00:39:01.358 --> 00:39:05.024
In country like ours, you see, what is the axis we have?

00:39:05.483 --> 00:39:07.983
The axis of our country is adhyatma.

00:39:10.233 --> 00:39:15.983
We have to now get over this hankering after money,

00:39:15.983 --> 00:39:19.191
development, this, that. First take to adhyatma.

00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:24.775
If people get realization before they are developed,

00:39:24.775 --> 00:39:28.817
there won't be the problem of creating another America here.

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:31.149
We don't have to become communist,

00:39:31.149 --> 00:39:32.817
we don't have to do anything like that,

00:39:32.817 --> 00:39:34.982
because communists are just the same as Americans,

00:39:34.982 --> 00:39:37.733
there's no difference at all in temperament.

00:39:38.608 --> 00:39:42.149
If an American is allowed to stay in Russia

00:39:42.149 --> 00:39:44.358
he'll behave the same way as a Russian behaves,

00:39:44.358 --> 00:39:46.024
and if a Russian is sent to America

00:39:46.024 --> 00:39:48.733
he behaves the same way as the Americans behave.

00:39:49.483 --> 00:39:51.149
There's no change at all.

00:39:51.149 --> 00:39:56.733
Now if the axis of adhyatma in any country

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.024
where a person achieves his spiritual ascent

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:07.982
is, becomes the most important thing and is achieved,

00:40:08.233 --> 00:40:10.274
then any amount of development,

00:40:10.525 --> 00:40:12.525
any amount of all these things

00:40:13.024 --> 00:40:16.608
cannot destroy that country,

00:40:16.608 --> 00:40:18.233
cannot create wars.

00:40:18.233 --> 00:40:20.149
There will be peace everywhere,

00:40:20.149 --> 00:40:22.149
there will be enjoyment everywhere.

00:40:22.149 --> 00:40:24.817
So on this day of Makar Sankrant

00:40:25.024 --> 00:40:27.733
let us say now the Sankrant is over,

00:40:27.982 --> 00:40:31.149
and we have to look forward to the new age

00:40:31.149 --> 00:40:38.733
of a new moon blessing us,

00:40:38.982 --> 00:40:42.024
and the great sun coming over

00:40:42.733 --> 00:40:45.525
to give us all the energy we need,

00:40:46.274 --> 00:40:51.858
to celebrate the advent of the golden age of Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:52.108 --> 00:40:53.982
May God bless you all.

00:41:02.441 --> 00:41:03.650
Now for the puja,

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:05.692
the Makar Sankrant Puja is very little,

00:41:05.692 --> 00:41:09.525
it's the puja of the Surya Devata, I don't know ...

00:42:37.858 --> 00:42:39.441
From the foreign country,

00:42:39.441 --> 00:42:43.274
who is going to stay after the

00:42:47.066 --> 00:42:53.441
11th, that is on the 12th? On the 12th - after the 12th.

00:42:54.441 --> 00:43:00.358
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten ...

00:43:01.441 --> 00:43:06.316
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

00:43:06.983 --> 00:43:08.608
All right, let's put it,

00:43:08.608 --> 00:43:12.692
who is going to stay in Bombay after the 11th?

00:43:20.733 --> 00:43:22.900
When are these people going?

00:43:23.483 --> 00:43:26.358
Those who are going to stay in Bombay after the 11th,

00:43:26.942 --> 00:43:30.316
when are they going, when are you going?

00:43:32.358 --> 00:43:35.983
You are coming to Pratishthan. All right.

00:43:36.358 --> 00:43:38.983
What about you, John?

00:43:52.983 --> 00:43:56.983
Do you want to stay here in Bombay,

00:43:56.983 --> 00:43:59.149
or you want to stay in Pratishthan?

00:44:03.942 --> 00:44:05.942
I mean, there's no arrangements here,

00:44:05.942 --> 00:44:10.316
so all those who are not going on the 11th or 12th,

00:44:11.441 --> 00:44:13.233
like that, in the near future,

00:44:14.566 --> 00:44:17.441
how many are those who are going to stay longer?

00:44:26.942 --> 00:44:30.108
About thirty-four. How many men and how many ladies?

00:44:36.942 --> 00:44:41.024
So we have decided that the men can come to Pratishthan,

00:44:41.358 --> 00:44:44.358
and the rest of the ladies can go to Alibagh.

00:44:44.358 --> 00:44:47.608
The reason is Pratishthan is still extremely spartan.

00:44:48.149 --> 00:44:49.692
It's not meant for ladies at all,

00:44:49.692 --> 00:44:52.108
and I have only one room where I live.

00:44:52.108 --> 00:44:55.108
So best thing would be to send all the ladies...

00:45:03.441 --> 00:45:05.233
Let them go to Alibagh,

00:45:05.608 --> 00:45:08.566
and let them pay for their stay in Alibagh

00:45:08.942 --> 00:45:12.775
to people who will be looking after them.

00:45:13.149 --> 00:45:15.108
Those who are coming to Pratishthan,

00:45:15.358 --> 00:45:18.900
how many there are? The rest of the men, about fifty.

00:45:20.483 --> 00:45:21.817
Fifty, all right.

00:45:22.692 --> 00:45:26.316
So when are you going back with the whole thing?

00:45:30.441 --> 00:45:33.441
You see, because it's such a liability, this work.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.024
You can come to Pratishthan

00:45:35.024 --> 00:45:37.024
if you want to take some photographs or things,

00:45:37.441 --> 00:45:39.608
but it's a liability for us because,

00:45:39.608 --> 00:45:41.942
you see, unless and until you go back,

00:45:42.149 --> 00:45:44.441
it will be a liability on our head all the time.

00:45:44.733 --> 00:45:46.566
So best thing is that you come to Pratishthan,

00:45:46.817 --> 00:45:49.149
do a little photography or whatever you want to do.

00:45:49.608 --> 00:45:51.775
And then you'd better book yourself,

00:45:52.024 --> 00:45:54.566
because this must go out of our country,

00:45:54.900 --> 00:45:56.692
otherwise they're always on our head,

00:45:58.441 --> 00:45:59.983
and they are following us.

00:46:00.650 --> 00:46:03.316
So I am sorry, but you'll have to go with this ...

00:46:03.858 --> 00:46:05.608
stuff that you are carrying.

00:46:05.982 --> 00:46:08.733
So we will have to do it in three, four days' time.

00:46:09.983 --> 00:46:12.733
You can finish the photography there,

00:46:12.982 --> 00:46:14.441
and you fix up your going.

00:46:14.983 --> 00:46:17.650
So for all the ladies who are going to stay on,

00:46:18.149 --> 00:46:22.525
can go in Washi or can go to Alibagh.

00:46:22.982 --> 00:46:24.316
Alibagh is better...

00:46:27.233 --> 00:46:30.775
They can go to Alibagh and stay there in Alibagh,

00:46:30.983 --> 00:46:33.108
about thirteen or fourteen ladies...

00:46:45.483 --> 00:46:46.942
All right, so done.

00:46:46.942 --> 00:46:50.191
Now let's ... Atharv, Ganesha ...

00:46:52.441 --> 00:46:54.775
Twenty-one people from America have to go,

00:46:54.775 --> 00:46:57.316
so we'll try to finish the puja as soon as possible,

00:46:57.692 --> 00:46:59.566
and they can leave.
