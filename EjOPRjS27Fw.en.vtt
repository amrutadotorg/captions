00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.940
[UNCLEAR]  has really nothing to do with ultimately the process of Self-realization.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.240
It is a manifestation and it is that to tell our egos shut up.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.480
That's the end of it. We needed some physical manifestation in our central nervous system

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.720
consciously, to know that the process has started, so that,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:32.580
this rational thinking, mechanic, mechanistic brain would start to quieten down - start to quieten down.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.140
And then the process of continuing to quieten down, takes place.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.580
And when it continues to quieten down more and more of the vibrations can be

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.320
taken in, more and more of these chakras can open,  more and more of the Kundalini can rise and

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.740
so the whole thing becomes a beautifully

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:59.340
expanding process of awareness and so you start to feel more of the silence.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.240
Your thoughts don't dominate you completely as much as they used to.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.500
You find that your awareness of yourself and of others changes.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.180
You find that the illnesses that you had often miraculously get better overnight.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.960
Others, which have been chronic in their onset, take time to be dissolved and to be neutralized.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.360
But, whatever it is, it works out. So, tonight I want to start with the Mooladhara Chakra and work up

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.780
and just show you a little bit of the practicality that is involved in Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.640
We have seven centers. They are made of five elements so combinations of those elements

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.580
and in Sahaja Yoga to deal with the blockages and to remove them so that more and more  of this experience can be felt

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.120
we have to use those elements. We have to move the energy, we have to raise the Kundalini, we have to allow

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.800
the energy to work it out in such a way that the whole process is one, as I said, of expansion.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:08.020
Expansion of the space within our Spiritual being, for the first time, consciously felt in our Nervous system

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.240
Now, we doctors don't know very much at all about the whole process.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.040
We're very limited in our understanding, in fact we absolutely blinking, quite often, to the whole process.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.600
We tend to think of health in terms of cause and effect - mostly effect.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:32.280
Sometimes we get to the causes. But we never even go, very often beyond the effect.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.960
And sometimes we can identify the cause. Actually the real cause is the blockage in the chakra.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.100
If the Chakra is blocked, if there is some sort of obstacle in the nadis - these channels,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.080
if there is any obstruction there, that in a way is the cause. Because if the chakra or the channel is blocked

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.700
that in turn transfers itself into the gross body, through the plexuses of  nerves

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.920
through the glands, through the circulatory system or through some combination of the neuro-physiological body

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:13.240
We don't understand the thing about the body beyond what we can see under a microscope or what we can

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.300
or what we can open up in surgery or what we can analyze through rational processes.

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:23.040
But that doesn't mean that we're blind completely. That doesn't mean that modern science is useless.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.540
In fact, to me, in my Self-realization modern medicine is a very useful adjunct

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:35.120
to Self-realization. So, I'm not here to absolutely decry modern medicine

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:42.540
but I'm here to say we have to open the blinkers and see that there is something beyond the physical and the emotional and the mental.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:49.160
And when, we see  that point then we can open ourselves to the room of the spirit and see that

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.480
when we become the spirit it becomes the one that rules the show.

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.400
It becomes the one that enlightens everything physical, mental and emotional.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.000
If everything is controlled from the highest automatically it bathes the lower with all its vibrations.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.880
and when that happens emotional health, mental health and physical health takes place.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.120
But that's an improvement of our recognizable parameters within our own physical being.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:29.040
But spiritually we become more integrated people - we become whole people. We become people who  become mild-mannered.

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:36.980
We start, as I told you, to become people who express the qualities - both men and women I'm talking about - of the mother.

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.500
We become therefore very loving -  but loving with a compassionate ring to it.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:50.620
But compassion  doesn't always mean goody goody business. It doesn't mean social work. It doesn't mean only concepts that

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:56.800
a lot of us have about improving the lot of the world or doing thing for society.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:03.400
Compassion means something which acts. Now, it can either act in a way which brings about your ascent

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:12.020
and it improves and nourishes and you start to feel the blessings of God in your awareness or it can remove

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:19.700
and throw out things which are useless. So compassion is something that acts either in

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:27.940
allowing you to appreciate your ascent or in removing obstacles, removing blockages

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:35.320
removing impediments which are in some way blocking you. Now, the all of this sounds like good theory.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:41.980
But in practice what happens. If, for example, in the Mooladhara chakra, in this red dot

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:49.380
which is located very near to the anal area, very near to the Pelvic plexus,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.980
very near to the Prostrate gland, very near to our whole aggregation of

00:05:56.220 --> 00:06:02.480
physiological phenomena within the body, that chakra controls

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:10.520
not just the physical manifestation but it controls the expression of  Holiness

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:16.880
and the expression of innocence within us because there is a God in potential there.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.060
And after realization that God doesn't potential anymore - that God becomes manifest.

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.720
Now, when those expressions of the Divine start taking place within you

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:35.240
automatically the badha - the blockages - start standing out sharply - in sharp relief

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:42.200
and you know exactly what's happening within you. You feel it it on your hand - here, right here - this is the place -

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:48.980
you can see on the hand on the chart. You feel it as a little pain just above the wrist of the base of the hand

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:53.440
This is the place of the Mooladhara chakra, it's the place on the heel.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:01.580
You feel a burning or a stinging or a pricking or a pain or some abnormal sensation and you know the reason obstruction in that center

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.200
and you know without judging yourself or without feeling guilty

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:12.380
that in someway you have offended the quality of innocence and purity and holiness within yourself.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:19.180
And that means that we have to be honest, we have to be sincere and yet we don't feel guilty about it we don't judge.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.780
[Pardon me] we don't judge ourselves, we just get on with the job of saying okay

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.480
"I have been damaged, O mighty God has blessed me with the chance of Self-realization, I'm going to face it,

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:38.700
I'm going to deal with it, I'm going to clear it out because I want, as a seeker, that holiness.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:46.280
I want to be rooted in holiness."  Rooted means Mooladhara.

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:54.760
Mooladhara means the support of the root. So, if the foundations are not absolutely strong

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:01.440
the whole tree will topple. Mother often says that we in the West have been so badly damaged in this chakra

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.960
because of our attitudes towards this chakra, because of our freedom

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:15.920
loving approach towards sex, because of the whole nature of the breakdown in righteousness in drama

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.220
we have damaged this chakra most. So, what have we done. Actually we've done the worst thing of all in a way.

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.180
We've committed a sin against the Mother. In India they do another thing. They commit a sin against the Father

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:31.700
because they don't trust that Almighty God will look after them

00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:38.340
They don't trust that God, the Father, is going to take care so they get problems in this chakra.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:46.160
But, we in the West get problems in the Mooladhara chakra, so the very root itself either has not penetrated deep

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.300
or, the roots themselves have been badly damaged. Now, we have to get to the knowledge of the roots.

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:59.980
and this is how in the West we have to go about repairing the damage. So, Mooladhara chakra is about our innocence,

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:07.180
it's about our holiness and we have to restore it because it's on that basis that the whole tree will grow.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:15.340
It's on that basis that the whole blossoming will take place. The Kundalini will not come up strongly anywhere

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:22.620
above that chakra if the base is weak, if the base is not repaired, if the negativity is not neutralized.

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:29.220
So, we have to face us all. We have to see honestly that there is a problem but without guilt.

00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:36.280
In Australia, perhaps more than anywhere else in the world, this problem of guilt is extraordinarily bad -

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:41.660
it's particularly bad in Melbourne because of what we've done in the past.

00:09:42.020 --> 00:09:47.820
Because we suddenly see in the light of day this is what it is all of a sudden we feel bad

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:55.840
And yet, quite often guilt, specially in the Catholic church and areas where  guilt is almost a mode of life

00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:05.280
we use it  as a way of excusing ourselves. If we feel guilty we can keep on doing the same thing again and again - that's the philosophy.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:13.120
And that has to stop. Neither it should be an escape, whereby, in a pouch we can tuck our,

00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:19.320
our guilt, so called, as a means of not facing up to the fact that

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:24.140
okay, the time has come to face it - we don't do this again.

00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:32.000
Or it's a way of expressing our lack of self-esteem, it's a way of expressing all sorts of

00:10:32.360 --> 00:10:36.560
funny feelings that go on within us which don't allow us to ascend.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:43.240
So this Mooladhara chakra, therefore, will be associated with purity and holiness in it's blossoming.

00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:51.560
But in it's blocked condition it will be associated with all sorts of damage which relates to

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:56.660
immoral acts, licentious attitudes towards sex,

00:10:57.140 --> 00:11:03.160
it relates to Tantric practices if you've been to a false guru such as Rajneesh or any of these people

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:08.680
you will be very, very badly damaged in that chakra and it will take months, if not years

00:11:08.900 --> 00:11:15.080
to repair. I'm telling you this very frankly because we know from experience if this is happened.

00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:23.060
If you use the name of God to express sex, if you use the whole process

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:29.320
of licentious attitudes as a means of ascend, so called,

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:34.900
then you are going to be quite badly damaged in that chakra. But it doesn't matter.

00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:42.800
The Kundalini will rise and it can be repaired. So, if you apply Tantric practices, as I said, which come from Tibet, incidentally

00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:49.500
the Lamas have brought it - it's nicely settled down in the foothills of the Himalayas and it's coming to the West

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:56.720
there are ashrams and it has many other ashrams all over Victoria. There are places where you can be very badly possessed

00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:02.200
by spirits of the dead which directly enter into the Mooladhara chakra.

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:08.980
If anybody has ever seen an initiation by, for example the Rajneesh people, you will see precisely

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:13.100
what I mean. It is directly an example of spirit possession.

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:17.620
And the nonsense they get up to, in the name of God, is deplorable.

00:12:17.880 --> 00:12:23.800
Now I'm being extremely frank with you because I've seen dozens and dozens of my patients who talk like

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:31.620
Bhagwan came into my aura and I love Bhagwan and how can I drop him and he's the wonderful man

00:12:31.980 --> 00:12:38.040
and they're still performing these dirty things. They're doing their Kundalini meditation, getting their clothes off

00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:43.120
and dancing nude until they're exhausted to rock and roll music - can you imagine?

00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:48.780
It is absurd, it's [ABSANE OR OBSCENE?] and it is anti- God. Now, we have to face these things.

00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:53.200
Mother apologizes for these horrible people that have come from India.

00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:01.920
But they've come to make money out of you, they've come to use us for their own pleasures, they've come to corrupt us

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:10.280
because they're anti- God in their activity and Mother is anti these fake gurus and She says it openly.

00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:18.460
She's repaired thousands of people who've damaged this chakra whether through false gurus or through our attitudes towards sex

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:28.220
and it's been a remarkable process. It's not only the example I gave you of one such false guru there are dozens of other

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:35.440
false pathways of psycho-sexual analysts' and so on. Doctors can quite often be false gurus.

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:40.400
Psychiatrists are the worst false gurus, quite often.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:45.420
They go into your mind and they start playing with this left side, regressing you

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:51.320
going back over your past, re-examining stuff, ideal conditions for spirit possession.

00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:58.060
Hypnosis is another one which is very damaging. You down the psyche to a point where you can put a suggestion in

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.020
- what you're doing is you're putting a spirit of the dead which is stronger than the one you've already got.

00:14:04.300 --> 00:14:11.640
So, if you want to stop smoking you can go to a somebody - I used to do it, I know - you can go to somebody

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:17.720
who will help you to stop smoking and you probably will stop smoking but what you're doing is you're putting an anti

00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:24.380
smoking spirit of the dead into the psyche which is more powerful than the one that wants to drag on a smoke all the time.

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:30.900
It is a very seditious process and be extremely careful of it, be careful of psychiatrists -

00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:36.900
I'm talking about your friends now because this is an area where you have to be very, very clear.

00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:44.280
Getting back to the Mooladhara chakra - it's our innocence and it's our holiness and it's controlled by the Earth itself.

00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:50.220
You're sitting on the Earth and we use the Earth as the means of sucking out this negativity.

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:57.500
If there is any indication of pain here, if we've got any of the diseases relating to that area of our body,

00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:03.860
if we've got burning or heat in that area, if we have any indications of pain in the heel even

00:15:04.140 --> 00:15:12.420
spurs on the heel, calcifications of the heels - they're all indications from the unconscious - that we have a problem in this chakra.

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:18.840
Every part of our body now becomes enlightened. This is a representation of this chakra

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:23.880
Here is equally represented by here.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:30.820
Here is represented by our right ankle. There are all sorts of co-relations within our body.

00:15:31.220 --> 00:15:37.840
If we start feeling pains in our head all of the chakras have got their place in the head and so you start to know

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.620
"I'm getting a pain on this part of my head"  - this relates to

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.740
an expression of the Swadhishthan chakra - you've got to start to learn of all this

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.640
and you start to know. When you're meditating if there is any interruption to your meditation

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:57.640
you will find, "Ah! That's what it is." You put your hand there, you take the vibrations in through the left hand

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:05.000
and you clear it out until the heat goes or the expression of pain or wringing or burning or tingling or whatever it might be disappears.

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:13.200
In a very dynamic way you sort it out for yourself. It becomes absolutely clear what to do but you have to

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:19.020
learn a little bit of knowledge. A little bit you have to learn this is the Nabhi, this is the Vishudhdhi,

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:24.980
this finger, this finger relates to that chakra - that's all. You have to know left side relates to

00:16:25.460 --> 00:16:32.920
your past, the emotions; the right side relates to your future, it relates to your pre-conscious mind. That's all, very simple stuff.

00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:38.200
You have to know which way to move your hands to give a balance. If you are a very, very

00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:43.500
right-sided person, which means that you're a person who lives principally in the future

00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:47.580
futuristic person who's always thinking about or worrying about the future

00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:54.320
then you have to raise the left side because you'll probably be emotionless, you'll be dried out

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:59.300
and you have to lower your right side to cool down and overheated condition in the body.

00:16:59.540 --> 00:17:05.220
You probably have a liver problem, you probably have a little bit of heat in your liver - that has to be cooled down.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:09.580
Therefore you have to know what type of food to eat if you've got a liver problem.

00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:15.580
But you raise the left side you lower the right - that means you awaken the left side and you

00:17:15.780 --> 00:17:22.560
cool down the right side. But if you're a very, very depressive person - not an egoistical person but a person who's very much

00:17:22.760 --> 00:17:29.640
very much reflective and thinking about the past - always living in a state of left side

00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:35.780
you raise the right side because you have to awaken the action part and you lower the left side.

00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:42.720
It all sounds so simple that you're probably saying, "No, no, no, this is too much,

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:46.320
what is he putting on me?" But it is simple.

00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.440
The quality of Almighty God's expression in mankind has to be simple.

00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:55.640
If there was some highly complicated mechanism that we had to understand

00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:59.280
or we had to go on some course - I once read a book

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:05.420
in my seeking called "A Course in Miracles." I mean it was a volume and volumes of books -

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:12.640
it's useless, if you have to do a course in it, forget it. Almighty God is going to take us to the next step

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:18.860
in Evolution in a very, very simple way. Sahaja yoga is simple. You just have to learn

00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:24.520
how to maneuver the energy, how to clear your chakras, how to go into thoughtless awareness,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:31.940
how to express the collective consciousness in a such a way that you can give vibrations to yourself and awaken

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:39.220
the vibrations in others, but not only that, but how you can let them become their own masters so that you  don't

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:46.260
become a doctor and patient relationship - that's what I do. I don't treat seekers any more as patients

00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:53.880
I give them their realization and I say, " Okay, it's over to you," and they become sahaja yogies and they become doctors themselves and they give

00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:01.640
others their Self-realization. But that's only for seekers. It, in 90% of people at this stage

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:09.240
people are not interested. They just want, "Fix my neck, fix my back, fix my heart, fix my headaches." That's basically what they want. So,

00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:16.200
still there's room for the doctors. The doctors are not going to get broke. But, there are seekers.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:23.440
There is a category of people who are looking for an answer beyond and they're the people to whom you can give realization.

00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:31.440
They're the people who you can share your blessing with. They're the people who will become the doctors of the future

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:39.000
because first they fix themselves then they start giving others the blessing whereby they can fix themselves.

00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:42.700
So, it is that we have to awaken the base chakra.

00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:50.400
We have to open that center of purity which becomes the root and in which the tree is embedded because

00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:57.620
if it's embedded in strong deep penetrating roots which are rich in

00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.000
purity and holiness and innocence and wisdom

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:09.880
- all of these things which are qualities there - then the whole tree will be strong. So, the first thing we've got to get right

00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:15.440
is the very thing which we, in Australia perhaps, have damaged most. And I say Australia

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:22.580
because Australia is the Mooladhara chakra of this Earth. Each major country or major area of the countries

00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:28.720
has a place in this chart and Australia is at the root. Australia is this

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:35.980
spot at the bottom. India is the Kundalini itself - the 31/2 coils.

00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:43.280
So, you got the Mother India sitting on - in Her place of holiness -

00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.480
sitting there with that purity despite all

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:55.320
the dirt outside, despite all the poverty, despite all the apparent unclean conditions which is where

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.740
She's located in our physical body and beneath Her is the most

00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:03.940
innocent of all Her son Shri Ganesha.

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:12.840
And Australia is that place. Australia is the Shri Ganesha of this Earth and as the Shri Ganesha of this Earth

00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:18.720
we have to express that innocence that we are. And if there's one thing that

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:24.660
you will notice of a sahaja yogi, after he gets his Self-realization, he becomes a very innocent person.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:31.820
He starts to take on the quality of innocence. Now, I'm not going to explain what that means to each and everyone of you

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:40.000
you will know. But, I believe, since realization that Australia is the most innocent place. We've got a crust of materialism,

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:45.600
Americanism, we've got a crust of all sorts of social nonsense on top,

00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:49.700
we've been hurted quite often some of the worst aspects from Britain -

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:56.920
whatever it might be, underneath there is the essential innocence of Australia which is there to maintain

00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:01.360
the strength of this great tree of humankind that has to grow.

00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:07.600
Now we have got our part to play in this great Universe in the next millennia that lies ahead.

00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:13.840
So we've got to get our act together without guilt and the way to do it is by purifying this chakra,

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:21.780
by awakening it, by letting the Mother Earth suck it out so we meditate on the earth, we use salt in the water in which we put our feet

00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:27.220
when we meditate. Salt representing the Earth - so simple.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:35.000
Whenever we can, if we've got damage to that chakra, we work it out. We observe the diseases disappearing.

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:42.960
We observe them disap ..... Prostatitis, all the different diseases, the Venereal diseases and so on disappear.

00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:50.100
All the problems relating to that area -  sciatica is one such - get better.

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:56.340
All the problems relating to our excretion, at the anal area, get better.

00:22:56.520 --> 00:23:02.600
All of these things work out in a miraculous way once this chakra starts improving. And so,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:09.800
that is the first one to become  enlightened because that's where the Kundalini is - she unwinds herself and she rises

00:23:10.060 --> 00:23:16.780
to the second center which is the Swadhishtana. Now Swadhishthana is related to a plexus

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.220
down in this area just above the Pelvic bone but towards the spinal column at the back.

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:31.040
That plexus relates to the organs such as the uterus, the kidneys, the various other organs

00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:37.840
in the lower part of the stomach and the other organs which are not part of the digestion system.

00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:46.620
So, it is that, if there is  problems in these organs we have to look to the Swadhishthana chakra

00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:53.140
for their correction. It's that center that gives us in the subtle body

00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.740
our creativity. It gives us the creative power - I talked to you about that the last night I'm not going to go into it.

00:23:59.220 --> 00:24:06.100
What I do want to say that is how we correct it. We use the two elements which are light and water

00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:13.180
It is made on the left of - I beg your pardon - fire and water not light - there's a subtle difference.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:20.620
On the left-hand side we use fire and on the right-hand side we use water. If it's both

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:25.860
catching - this is the finger that represents that chakra - the thumb, if you've got pain

00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:33.480
pricking, burning in this thumb you know you've got a problem in one or the other or both of these chakras. If it's on the left we correct it with

00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:39.860
fire. We use a candle, usually, and we just do a little bandhan or a circle in that way which

00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:48.860
clears it out and you start to observe my goodness the pain is disappearing - the blockage is being removed, the whole thing is mellowing and

00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:54.760
after the treatment - it might be 10 or 15 minutes - if I'm, my goodness that chakra is getting better.

00:24:55.100 --> 00:25:02.100
On the right-hand side we use water, we put our feet in the bowl of salty water - water element [UNCLEAR] things. [Come in]

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:10.140
So, it is that we work it out with the elements. This Nabhi chakra we use the water element only.

00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:17.920
We use the water element because the process which is most responsive

00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:24.720
to the water element is the digestive center and the whole area within us

00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:30.260
which relates to the water element that lies within us. And yet this is not some nebulous theory

00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:34.500
relating to Astrology or something like this it's downright practical stuff.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:42.700
If you've got a pain in the tummy, if you've got a gut ulcer, if you've got problems in this area, then, you will in fact

00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:49.520
immediately start benefiting from problems, from being treated by the water element.

00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:53.760
I'll give you an example. I had in my practice in Sydney

00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:00.360
a nun, a Mother Superior in fact, of a [UNCLEAR -  NOVITIATE?] college of young nuns.

00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:07.960
who used to come to me as a patient and she had a severe duodenal ulcer bleeding badly and a [UNCLEAR] in the stones and everything else.

00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:16.280
and she was being treated and I was getting a little success with orthodox treatment but

00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:23.420
because I felt her vibrations that she's a seeker I gave her Self-realization, I explained to her, I was very careful

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:29.120
not to say very much about Shri Mataji, because this was the just kind of be too much but

00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:37.760
I very carefully said 'The energy of the Holy Spirit' or some such generalized term and talked about it in that way

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:43.000
and I said if you just meditate, if you put your hand on the stomach each day

00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:50.700
and work on it for 20 minutes with your feet in a bowl of salt water or better still if you sit in a bath up to here using the water element

00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:58.500
I'm sure that this problem will disappear. She really was a seeker, she love, she had the love of God expressed in her heart,

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:04.660
she was a beaming, radiant person but she had so many worries. She was in charge of a novitiate, she had money problems

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:12.020
with running it, she had problems with the staff - she was a very sensitive person and so she was picking up on a lot of the rubbish of that place.

00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:19.680
And she got a gut ulcer because she's a sensitive seeker. And so as a result of that sensitivity,

00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:27.180
she was in trouble. Now, the miraculous thing that happened was that in 10 days - she came to me 2 or 3 times over the 10 day period -

00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:34.180
I was able to observe - but more particularly she was able to observe - that the bleeding got less, the pain got less and she was

00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:41.760
taking less and less of the medication. By 10 days she was healed. Now that was incredible

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.420
because there she was with living proof that she was healed.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:54.760
I talked to her about Shri Mataji after 10 days, I explained to her a little more about Her and now I'm sure,

00:27:55.060 --> 00:28:01.000
she's a very well person and in her own quiet way, probably not professing it publicly, because

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:08.280
let's face it, she's been an institutional framework of the church and it would be very difficult to go about talking about these things.

00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:16.080
But she is healed and she understands where the healing has come from. These miracles happen every moment

00:28:16.340 --> 00:28:20.200
not just in the physical sense but in the most wide sense.

00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:28.680
Shri Mataji's told you about a few of the miracles and possibly She'll tell you of some of the others. Quite miraculous things happen in Sahaja yoga.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:36.880
So, this chakra is made of the water element and we use it. We give vibrations here. We work on this chakra

00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:41.920
We take out the negativity and at the same time as we're taking out the negativity

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:49.200
the vibrations of the Unconscious are flowing into that center to neutralize and therefore, take out

00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:57.180
and to allow to flow in the positive vibrations which are going to enhance that spiritual space which has to

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:03.820
come and express it's own divinity. Then at the heart chakra we're made principally of the air element.

00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:08.900
I say principally of the air because there's always the combination of one or others.

00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:16.460
Actually the combination here is as you might expect, air and water. Water for circulation, water for breathing

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:22.640
as well as air. So you've got principally air element at this point. Shri Mataji is here.

00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.900
Please be seated.

00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:53.240
So, when we have heart problems, when we have breathing problems,

00:29:53.740 --> 00:30:00.180
when we have problems relating to the lungs, to the heart, to the cardiac plexus area

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:06.900
or even to the Thymus gland, which controls the production of white blood cells, when we've got any of these things

00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:14.480
troubling our physical body, or if we've got insecurities, if we've got problems relating to relationships

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.880
between say mother and daughter, father and son, husband and wife,

00:30:20.100 --> 00:30:27.260
because this is the expression of security within us - if we treat this chakra with the vibrations

00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:32.800
that are flowing through us - things get better. The insecurity disappears -

00:30:32.980 --> 00:30:40.080
that irrational insecurity that sometimes we feel, which we can't explain, is often a catch on the center heart chakra.

00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:48.500
If we've got a problem between ourselves and our brother or our father or our son - if in other words there's a problem on the

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:56.280
father side or the side of the male aspect - then, we will often feel it as pain in the right heart.

00:30:56.540 --> 00:31:03.260
We may feel it in the right little finger. But more than anything we'll start to express disease processes

00:31:03.660 --> 00:31:09.980
which cause problems. You may start to feel some blood pressure although that's not the prime cause.

00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:17.680
You may start to feel the onset of bronchial asthma. You may start to feel all sorts of

00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:24.880
pulmonary problems relating to the whole structure of either the lungs or the heart on the right side.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:31.540
But there're very different of problems on the left side. On the left side is the side of the mother.

00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:37.720
It's the side in which the spirit, itself, resides in the core of the heart.

00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:45.480
So, if there's a problem with, within us within our relationships with our mother - if our mother is not loving,

00:31:46.820 --> 00:31:54.100
if there is a breakdown in say us as a mother to our children - we may catch in this center.

00:31:54.360 --> 00:32:02.260
Either way there is going to be a disturbance, the chakra is going to squeezed or twisted or even somewhat

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:07.460
detached from itself and there's going to be a problem. We might even have had a heart attack,

00:32:08.060 --> 00:32:15.560
we might even be suffering angina. Whatever it might be things go wrong and we start to observe it.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:23.840
And in sahaja yoga, by giving vibrations to those chakras, we can neutralize,  we can neutralize even the cause.

00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.620
Because we're going beyond the cause as Shri Mataji has told you and will probably  explain again.

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.240
Because we doctors at best are dealing with the cause - at best. But we go beyond the cause because the Kundalini itself,

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:45.440
being the purest of energy, being the pure desire to be one with God, takes us beyond that. And if you use the highest energy

00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:51.860
then naturally it will neutralize the distortions and abnormalities in the lower.

00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:59.360
Then we have the Vishudhi chakra. Vishudhi  is made of the Ether - that material of the matrix of the Universe -

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:06.620
it's like the architecture, it's like the bones of the building upon which hang all the others.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:13.660
And through which passes, for example, radio waves, television  pictures, newspaper,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:20.940
photographs that are transmitted through the airways - it's that etheric material

00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:28.860
which is in every cell, every particle of our body and which is vital to the transmission

00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:36.240
of the prana-shakti, the Chi energy - the energy of the life force itself which helps with the sustenance of life

00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:43.580
it's the vital force, if you like, which is not our spirit but which is the energy which gives us this physical body's

00:33:43.780 --> 00:33:51.440
vital strength. So, this etheric material is important. But once that chakra becomes blocked,

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:57.920
once we lose that power of being the witness of the drama of life, once we don't see the point

00:33:58.380 --> 00:34:01.800
that, "My God there is an All- pervading power,

00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:08.460
there is a great God beyond which is controlling the whole show." If we lose that vision

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:16.480
then this chakra becomes ill. If you become angry, if we become guilty, if we start getting involved in the drama

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:22.900
we lose the quality of this chakra and we have to restore it - we give vibrations, we awaken

00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:29.720
the positive qualities of that chakra, we allow it to be nurtured again. As spondylitis disappears

00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:37.060
our thyroid gland gets better, our shoulder pain gets less, our facial tension disappears.

00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:44.020
All the problems of the face, the skin, the nose, the eyes, the hearing, get better.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:51.560
These are the blessings of the Kundalini reaching this center, awakening it, nourishing it and neutralizing

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:56.420
and bringing us back into the space which is the center, which is the Vishuddhi.

00:34:56.660 --> 00:35:03.920
Then at the Agnya, as I said, that center is made of the light. It's made of the light element itself

00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:10.920
and we use light to purify and to remove the blockages. Christ said, "I am the light."

00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:18.360
Christ said that, "I have died for your sins," so we don't have to suffer.

00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:24.160
So that, at the time of Self-realization, when the Kundalini starts nourishing this chakra,

00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:30.880
you start to know what is an egoless person, you start to know, you start to watch your ego.

00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:35.740
You start to say, "Hello there, Mr. Warren, you're standing up in front of the crowd,

00:35:36.540 --> 00:35:44.220
now, are you being a bit of an egoist standing up here talking to them like this or are you getting more to the center?

00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:51.440
Are you watching yourself or are you getting involved in some sort of drama which is there to blow up your own ego?"

00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:57.520
And you start watching it as a third person. So you become a person who

00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:03.700
starts to take on an egoless condition. You don't respond to all that is dead in you,

00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:10.800
you don't respond to all that is past, you don't live in a sub-conscious condition in which you are constantly dragged

00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:18.040
into the past where you're reflective, where you're constantly in a  sort of semi-dream state about the past.

00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:22.760
So neither you suffer the pains of the past

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:30.100
nor do you constantly get dragged into the future with the pre-conscious mind, the Pitutary gland opens,

00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:37.140
the two hemispheres of the brain start to become enlightened by the vibrations of the Unconscious,

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:43.780
and those two hemispheres, themselves, take on a new dimension which is enlightened awareness.

00:36:44.980 --> 00:36:52.300
And when that happens the Kundalini can pass above that center into the next space which is the limbic area of the brain

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:59.480
which is that part which starts to feel that oneness with Almighty God.

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:06.220
It starts to feel and enjoy itself. So the real you, the Atma,

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:14.360
the spirit which Christ talked about, starts to enjoy itself. You start to enter into the kingdom of God in a way

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:19.120
in which you start to know the peace. You know the silence.

00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:28.220
The love of God is not a concept anymore because you start to become love and you start to share it with others.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:36.540
Sometimes you become angry with negativity and that anger dissolves the negativity too.

00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.840
That's the compassion which is acting sometimes.

00:37:41.940 --> 00:37:47.920
But the love that acts as compassion of the Mother starts to express itself at this center

00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:55.860
because the Kundalini comes to this center, it opens, it nourishes - this chakra starts to become like a catchment

00:37:56.220 --> 00:38:03.800
for the Unconscious. All knowledge, all power starts to flow in through this center because the Kundalini has risen

00:38:04.180 --> 00:38:10.100
it's connected you and the Grace or the Brahma shakti starts flowing down doing the job.

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:18.100
So you start to feel a peaceful person. You become a very knowledgeable person. Shri Mataji has told me much of this

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:26.340
but I have never spoken in public before I came to sahaja yoga. I'd never as much as given a public lecture.

00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:34.300
And yet, I know with confidence that what I'm saying is correct and if I say something which is incorrect

00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:42.180
I get heat in my body or I get burning or I get some sort of prickling going inside my body, "No, no Warren, you're off, you're off center. Stop."

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:48.340
Then you correct yourself and you can speak clearly again, in the center, in the center.

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:55.320
It works out like that, it's self corrective. There's a homeostatic in built mechanism that brings you back to the center.

00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:59.340
That's the parasympathetic which we doctors know nothing about.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:07.020
So, this last chakra opens, it gets nourished all the

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:13.040
qualities within you start taking up their place in the head because they're all resident there.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:21.420
This chakra is here - yes - then we have this the Vishudhhi takes it's place here, then we have the others taking their place in the head.

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:29.760
And you start to feel the awareness of Almighty God's greatness within your own

00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:37.660
being. You start to feel a realized soul. You start to feel that confidence, you feel that love,

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:43.340
you feel that desire to share it with others. And it works out in that way.

00:39:43.800 --> 00:39:51.240
So we use the elements. We don't put attention to the negativity, we put attention to opening the space of

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:56.900
spiritual awareness. We give ourselves a balance.

00:39:57.660 --> 00:40:01.080
We work it out so that all the nadis get purified.

00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:08.780
And you start to allow the Brahmashakti, you allow the Grace to flow, flow. and so you become like an instrument,

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:14.420
everyday a better instrument, so that everything around you gets purified.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:20.780
You get purified and everything around you gets purified. You transform your families, you work situations.

00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:27.580
And it really does work out that way and you become an extraordinarily beautiful personality

00:40:27.900 --> 00:40:33.000
in which you really feel the quality of sainthood. Yeah, that's not an ego trip to say it.

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:39.260
You feel the quality of sainthood, you want to share that saintliness with others

00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:45.280
because saintliness is not something which is a mental concept. Saintliness is a state of being.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:51.460
Either you are a connected being to God or you're not. Now, if you are connected to God

00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:58.620
jolly well you have to become a saint and you have to face that point without any false modesty.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:02.880
You have to give realization to others, you have to make them doctors.

00:41:04.820 --> 00:41:11.980
It's a tremendous work and to the people of Melbourne all I want to say is that now that Mother has blessed you

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:16.400
you have got this responsibility to take others

00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:24.020
into that state of awareness and to bring them in to this collective evolution that has to take place

00:41:24.260 --> 00:41:31.200
on this Universe, this great Universe, which Mother is not going to allow to be destroyed which is not going to

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:37.560
suffer any more injury, which is going to

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:43.920
bless each and everyone of the seekers and if they're not seekers now, you are going to make them the seekers.

00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:50.100
I'm really happy, again, to introduce Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi to all of you.

00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:57.320
[CLAPS] - Somebody lady who is tired ask her to sit down on the chair.

00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:00.720
- Yes, who is that? 
- Somebody is tired, somebody who is tired

00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:05.280
- Somebody who is very tired can sit there 
- can come, sit down. There's a comfortable seat for

00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:11.120
- [UNCLEAR] No? That's what I'm saying. Please come and sit comfortably on the seat. 
- There's a comfortable seat for you here. Can you put it there?

00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:14.660
- Come and sit. 
- Be comfortable, all right. 
-  Be comfortable in this seat.

00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:19.100
- Tired means you may be suffering pain. 
- What is it? 
- She's got pain.

00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:25.840
Pain in the body? Please help her, help her. Sahaja yogies, go and help her. Yes.

00:42:28.100 --> 00:42:31.400
You can only put up with pain for so long

00:42:43.380 --> 00:42:49.240
Yes, but it is cold from there, is it? Close the, close the thing so the breeze doesn't come in.

00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:58.260
Are you comfortable now? All right.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:02.600
Please move forward, I think.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.500
Just keep a circle around this electronic equipment

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:22.760
I would say that sahaja yogies should go at the back and let the people who have come for the first time sit in front.

00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:36.240
Annh... [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:43.540
I know you. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. All right, doesn't matter.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:59.980
- What's that? There's a gunshot. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] 
- You're a films

00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:04.840
- You're a T.V. personality now, Mother. 
- Is it?

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:13.120
Eh.. It's worse than that, I think, just now - It's too much. All right, doesn't matter. Please be seated. Please be seated.

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:34.200
I'm very happy that so many people have been able to come down.

00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:39.240
It's really a joyous moment to see so many people from Melbourne are here

00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:44.280
to establish their realization.

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:51.600
There are three types of people who

00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:56.600
come to seeking.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:05.200
The lowest type are the ones who have some sort of physical ailments

00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:12.680
or some torture some diseases or who are on the verge of dying or something like that, an emergency

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:16.100
in their mind so they come to sahaja yoga.

00:45:18.740 --> 00:45:24.480
All right, even if they come, they can be helped - that's not our top priority.

00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:34.720
Then there are second type of sahaja yogies or we can say the people who come to sahaja yoga

00:45:35.620 --> 00:45:41.180
are the people who are seeking other things in life

00:45:41.420 --> 00:45:45.200
like jobs, money, this, that all nonsensical things.

00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:51.580
But, among them there are some people

00:45:52.680 --> 00:45:56.600
who want to know the cause of the problem why they are like that.

00:45:59.440 --> 00:46:05.380
The third type are the people who can be divided into two

00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:13.200
one the type that seeks balance, dharma, righteousness

00:46:14.140 --> 00:46:19.520
because they find in the world people are so horrible,

00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:25.080
so mischievous, so dangerous, so restless

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.280
- they get worried about all the worldly

00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:38.720
turmoils that are on, they get shocked

00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.260
and then they want to find a solution why have I come on this earth?

00:46:45.580 --> 00:46:48.620
This is one type as we call bahirmukhis -

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:56.160
the ones, whose attention is outside but in a very subtler way, in a very Divine way.

00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:04.360
The second ones, in the same category, are the ones who are seekers

00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:11.680
who have been seeking in ages. They have been seeking in many lives

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:18.900
they have been seekers of truth. They have been on hills and dales - Himalayas, everywhere -

00:47:19.100 --> 00:47:26.480
have done everything else and now born again here to be, to be able to find out the truth.

00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:33.400
These are called as Antarmukhis - these are the people who are

00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:43.140
inward. So the first priority we have to have

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.120
of the third category, both the types are equally important.

00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:57.820
But after becoming realized, when you get your realization, then you achieve both the qualities simultaneously.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:05.600
You become a yogi inside and connected with the whole world.

00:48:05.800 --> 00:48:10.500
Your attention starts going outward because first the light is to be enlightened

00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:14.160
and the when light is enlightened, it gives the light.

00:48:15.860 --> 00:48:21.380
Now this Kundalini, the force within you, as is said, is pure desire.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:28.820
It's not only pure desire but it is a purification desire.

00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:33.640
It has a power to purify - tremendous power it is.

00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:41.460
And this Kundalini thinks, organizes,

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:50.560
knows, co-ordinates, blesses and ultimately guides.

00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:59.140
So to go beyond the cause

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:06.120
we must understand that this Kundalini is the pure form.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:11.400
That means it is detached. Anything that gets attached is not pure.

00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:19.560
Anything that gets spoilt is not pure.

00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:27.040
What we say gold is pure because it is untarnishable -

00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:34.860
untarnishable, that's the quality of gold. So it is immaculate.

00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:42.500
It cannot be ruined, spoiled by anything except that

00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:48.940
there could be khand, as they call it, could be broken in between and thus weak.

00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:57.300
So now, something that has a purifying quality like a

00:49:57.520 --> 00:50:02.940
purifying agent, say, take a simple thing like soap. So the soap,

00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:10.000
wherever you apply, will clean. Kundalini wherever it will go it will clean, it will nourish.

00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:18.680
This is one quality that we must understand that it is not tarnishable, it cannot be spoiled,

00:50:18.920 --> 00:50:25.380
it cannot be ruined, moreover it cleanses, it nourishes

00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:31.980
but because it thinks, it knows how to nourish you up to what point

00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:35.460
how to go, how far to go or it stops.

00:50:37.580 --> 00:50:41.860
But thinking is not vocal, it doesn't say anything

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:46.300
but when it goes round these chakras it makes a sound.

00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:51.540
And these sounds are made because the movement

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:56.560
of Kundalini through these chakras creates

00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:03.400
a non- percussion sound pass through these

00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:07.560
creating sounds and these sounds are then

00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:15.800
jotted down or heard by great saints and used in the phonetic language of Sanskrit.

00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.140
That's why Sanskrit is supposed to be the purest language.

00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.880
But you need not know Sanskrit now - there's no need

00:51:26.140 --> 00:51:31.680
because the deities know that you don't know the Sanskrit language.

00:51:33.200 --> 00:51:40.780
Now, this purifying fire within you or the purifying force within you or the power within you

00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:48.460
goes and first of all enlightens our attention which is in this part

00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:51.880
as you see the green part - this is the attention is.

00:51:52.140 --> 00:51:56.080
But the movement of attention then starts moving in all directions.

00:51:56.580 --> 00:52:01.500
Now when your  attention is enlightened what we call we become collectively conscious.

00:52:02.300 --> 00:52:06.500
But still how do you go beyond cause and effect is the point?

00:52:07.100 --> 00:52:14.880
Now, this Kundalini being pure no cause can be attached to it - no cause, whatsoever.

00:52:15.540 --> 00:52:20.400
So, if you can enter into the Kundalini on the principle of it

00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:24.420
no cause can get attached to it.

00:52:25.320 --> 00:52:29.200
That's how you go beyond cause and effect.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:34.520
But how do you enter into the Kundalini, that's the main point?

00:52:34.740 --> 00:52:41.700
Main problem is how do we enter into the Kundalini? Supposing you are paying attention to Me and I say pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:48.640
Even if Kundalini rises your attention is attracted inside still you cannot pay attention inside.

00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:54.920
So how do you pay attention inside is through this enlightened attention.

00:52:55.180 --> 00:53:02.140
This attention which is enlightened has a power to take your attention inside

00:53:02.900 --> 00:53:10.820
to the Kundalini and that's how you enter into the realm which is detached - that [UNCLEAR -LIKE?] fortress.

00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:19.100
Nobody can enter in there. So, when you're in thoughtless awareness, when you're not thinking, you are in your fortress no body can

00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.180
jump at you, nobody can trouble you - all the causes drop off.

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:28.840
That is why it is necessary first to practice to be in that thoughtless awareness

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:35.100
through the practice of sahaja yoga to begin with so that you learn how to enter into that state -

00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:41.580
how to enter into that state. But first and foremost thing is that your Kundalini must be awakened,

00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:47.320
then it must be allowed to move properly - you must co-operate, you must know how to do it

00:53:47.520 --> 00:53:50.600
and raise it so that you keep it

00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:57.700
at least if not above, at least in the brain.

00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:04.480
But best thing is if it comes out then you have no tensions, no worries

00:54:04.700 --> 00:54:10.860
because everything that you have passes into your attention,

00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:14.880
attention touches the Kundalini because you are a realized soul

00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:22.600
and leaves it in the force of the Kundalini, in the current of Kundalini

00:54:22.820 --> 00:54:28.740
and this current takes away everything that is out and that's how you are cleared away.

00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:35.860
This is a very, very simple way of explaining how you go beyond cause and effect.

00:54:36.420 --> 00:54:41.460
And this is what happens but for that it is necessary that you must learn

00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:46.980
how to enter into your Kundalini, how to keep your attention

00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:55.280
enlightened. Now it's very easy - your attention gets involved in to anything through your thoughts.

00:54:56.960 --> 00:55:00.560
Because when your consciousness entered into you -

00:55:00.780 --> 00:55:05.440
- being the prismatic brain - like a prism - your attention has gone out.

00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:11.620
Now, to keep this attention detached you have to make it a pure attention.

00:55:12.240 --> 00:55:17.200
to begin with you must try to put attention inside

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:21.980
to be a witness, try to be a witness. But how, how will you know that you are a witness?

00:55:22.420 --> 00:55:27.200
You have to be in thoughtless awareness. When you are in thoughtless awareness

00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.900
then what happens that you're detached, you're seeing everything.

00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:37.460
There're many people who talk about thoughtless awareness - you'll be surprised - I've heard some gurus -

00:55:37.660 --> 00:55:41.180
they might have, I don't know because I went to America long time back

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:45.700
and they must have recorded it or whatever it is, they talk of it

00:55:45.980 --> 00:55:52.440
but there isn't anything way of doing it. Kundalini is the only way you can go into thoughtless awareness your attention can go.

00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:58.620
So, these people are also using words of sahaja yoga, I've seen that,

00:55:58.920 --> 00:56:02.140
has no meaning because they cannot reach the Kundalini but

00:56:02.420 --> 00:56:08.800
there makes no difference because now you have become your own guru and you find out for yourself. So, throw away all these

00:56:09.060 --> 00:56:15.160
fake gurus away from you. The problems, the barriers, the worst of all

00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:23.040
in sahaja yoga comes from people who have been to other gurus - it's a headache, I tell you, for you and for us.

00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:29.960
First of all that you should realize that whatever you have been doing with other gurus has been all false and fake, is difficult

00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:33.120
because you're so conditioned - I must tell you very frankly.

00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.380
So, the growth doesn't take place because you have to become the guru.

00:56:37.600 --> 00:56:43.940
You cannot depend on anybody as guru but you have to become the guru. I can only guide you as a Mother, I can only tell you what it is,

00:56:44.160 --> 00:56:50.040
I can only take your Kundalini there but it is you who has to become. Like I would say, I can cook for you

00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:54.780
but you have to eat and you have to enjoy the taste of it - I can't enjoy for you.

00:56:56.800 --> 00:57:02.760
So then, you have to give up those things which you have been following which are wrong.

00:57:02.980 --> 00:57:08.100
There may be some guru who might have been a good guru but I don't think anybody has come on the Western side.

00:57:08.340 --> 00:57:14.280
I haven't known of anyone who has come on the Western side because I sent one fellow, he ran away in three days from New York.

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:19.740
He wouldn't settle down there, he ran up to the Himalayas and he said, " I don't want to come, Mother, don't send me anywhere."

00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:27.740
He couldn't bear the people, he didn't have the patience [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]. So,

00:57:27.980 --> 00:57:33.660
though they did not crucify him [WISELY OR FIRSTLY?] he ran away, you see [SHRI  MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:40.080
He said, " Whatever you may say, Mother I cannot face these people are terrible. They are just Dollars, nothing else but moving Dollars."

00:57:40.340 --> 00:57:43.320
[ALL LAUGH]

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:49.500
All right, so, with this kind of barrier it's very difficult to convince people.

00:57:49.740 --> 00:57:57.400
Still they'll go on fighting, "This my guru says so, my guru..." Then you go to your guru is the best way we take it because how can we go on convincing.

00:57:57.620 --> 00:58:03.020
You also get a headache, you see, if you take some horrible guru's name you get a headache - really, you get a catch.

00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:09.640
You get a catch on this finger, you get a catch on this finger, you get catch everywhere, so you don't want to hear about any guru.

00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:14.100
Even discussing these gurus you feel terrible - so disgusting.

00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:20.100
Whether fake, horrible, money makers, you don't know when you see them you don't know whether to laugh or to cry -

00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:26.360
- this is the situation. So, best is to find out for yourself

00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:30.840
if you're willing to give up the gurus then only trouble the sahaja yogies - you see, they get fed up with it.

00:58:31.120 --> 00:58:36.900
They don't want to fight that. Now, even if you want to give up they won't give you up because they have possessed you.

00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:45.680
They're like leeches, you see, so, you still have catches of the guru. This is the worst catch that we have so far seen.

00:58:46.420 --> 00:58:52.100
Now in the beginning of course, they had patience but now, I think, they have exhausted the patience

00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:57.240
so, when yesterday I told them there were lots of people in Melbourne, I think, lot of people will come to sahaja yogies

00:58:57.460 --> 00:59:03.600
But they asked Me one question, "But how many from other gurus, God alone knows," - because it's a big headache.

00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:11.000
So, I would request you to put your guru on somewhere else and come here and see that you become the 
guru to understand that another fellow.

00:59:12.820 --> 00:59:20.360
And then when they discover about the guru they go on saying, "That chap, that guy"

00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:26.140
and all kinds of things they say about him but before that they'll fight for that guru.

00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:30.940
So, that is one thing you must understand that don't play into the hands of these

00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:37.700
people because, " I paid for it Mother, I paid six thousand pounds." All right, so what, must you have more of that?

00:59:37.960 --> 00:59:43.980
Because they suffer, they have Epilepsies, they have all kinds of problems. We've had people of gurus who had Epilepsies.

00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:49.100
Horrible! This is TM people having Epilepsies - I've cured so many of them, I openly say that.

00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:55.200
Some doctor, is Dr. Frenic, he's publishing article about it - nobody listens.

00:59:55.580 --> 01:00:01.200
There's a competition going on like a horse racing, "Oh, have you been to TM?" "No, it's expensive. All right I'll try that."

01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:04.540
There's a sale on - Guru shopping sale.

01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:09.320
So, there's a competition [UNCLEAR - SETTING OR SET IN?]. "Have you been to that sale, have you been to that sale?"

01:00:09.620 --> 01:00:14.840
It's like that. So, you must know it's frivolous, it's cheapish, it's useless.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:21.640
Come to the,  "Brass Tacks'," the Americans say. Come to reality

01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:28.040
and see for yourself that these are all fake things, this is not the way you can raise the Kundalini.

01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:32.620
The greatest criteria, of course, is money but another one is that

01:00:32.840 --> 01:00:36.600
that whatever they tell you you can do it yourself. Why do you need a guru for that?

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:40.220
Like somebody said, " My guru gave me a name."  I mean anybody can give you a name,.

01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:43.580
you can give yourself a name, whatever you want. Why do you need a guru for that?

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:51.520
Or, "He gave me these clothes or he gave me this mala or he made me jump or he made me take out the clothes

01:00:51.740 --> 01:00:56.660
or somebody, you see, another fellow is eh... giving me drugs,

01:00:56.980 --> 01:01:03.660
third person allows me to do that."  I mean, as if these gurus allow you, you think that God will allow you also?

01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:10.320
"He allows us to have mass sex, so he's a very good guru because he allows us."

01:01:10.460 --> 01:01:16.380
Why don't you go to some other places where you can do it without taking an allowance and payment to the guru?

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:24.160
But the guru is waiting in the Hell and you will be there soon. This is fact.

01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:28.280
So, don't go after such horrible gurus who teach you all wrong things.

01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:33.800
Now, what is it, is that we, as soon as we get our realization

01:01:34.020 --> 01:01:41.340
we also realize about ourselves that, "This part of ours is lost, that part of ours is lost, this is not there,"

01:01:41.560 --> 01:01:46.600
we realize and when we realize that we don't mind correcting it because we see ourselves.

01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:52.640
We don't have to ask anybody we just see this thing within us happening. We see this part is not there,

01:01:52.840 --> 01:02:00.160
our attention is not all right, we cannot concentrate on anything. We understand so many things about ourselves after realization.

01:02:00.580 --> 01:02:06.740
Now, for that, supposing Mr. X has some problem - he tries to solve his problem, he cannot

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.120
because he has his own problem so he comes to the collective, he comes to the whole

01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:17.860
then what happens somebody else has got that point stronger and some other point weaker

01:02:18.160 --> 01:02:23.780
as a result the strength of one person helps  another person's weakness to be cured.

01:02:24.060 --> 01:02:30.500
And that's how there is a mutual curing system process which builds in and that's how people get

01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:35.360
themselves all right perfected. And that is why it's a collective happening.

01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:41.920
And when you become collective, you'll be surprised your heart opens out and you're amazed that human beings are so good,

01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:49.180
so beautiful, they're all such beautiful creation of God. You start enjoying each other really feeling the expansion of your being -

01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:53.080
that you are the other, that they are you. Such a great feeling!

01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:57.740
I don't know if you can feel it at this stage or not but just to think they are all yours

01:02:58.460 --> 01:03:05.540
and you are theirs - no problem remains between relationships, nothing. No, no problems of any kind.

01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:11.660
But also no problems that would affect you remains because everybody's there to fight for you,

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:17.780
to work for you, to help you out. It's very surprising how it works out. Even relations

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:25.040
of sahaja yogies are helped so much that they're amazed how so many come forward to help.

01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:30.460
Normally people gather only for festivals or good things but when there is difficulty nobody gathers.

01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:36.160
And this is something great about sahaja yogies that when there is a difficulty in a sahaja yogi -

01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.960
supposing, a sahaja yogi has a mother who's sick and she's not a sahaja yogini, they'll go and help her.

01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:50.100
But she has to be a relation, somebody close to the sahaja yogi. The attention has to be there that a sahaja yogi

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:56.300
is there in trouble we must help our brother. You really become pure brothers and sisters after coming to sahaja yoga.

01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:04.860
This is what happens very easily to you so you must be collective being. That's how you start correcting each other.

01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:13.240
Also you develop all the knowledge, everything about sahaja yoga you understand - it's very knowledgeable.

01:04:13.500 --> 01:04:19.140
Because once you know all about it you're amazed. There are people who have never spoken in the public

01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:25.540
I find, after realization, after a month they're great speakers - suddenly you see them - can't believe it.

01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:32.580
The other day, I was in a village travelling by a bullock-cart and the bullock-cart driver - I talked to him and I said, 'What

01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.360
this is Nanaka or is it Kabira speaking!' Such a great saintly sayings -

01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:43.900
I was amazed. I said, 'From where did you get it?' He said, "Mother, from you." I said, 'From Me? I'm quite amazed,

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:47.300
it's coming from where?' He said, "It's all coming from my brain only."

01:04:47.560 --> 01:04:54.220
So, your brain gets that kind of an enlightenment - not that you become a saint you talk like a saint, you walk like a saint,

01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:01.300
all your behavior is saintly. Nobody has to tell you - just become. The whole countenance, temperament,

01:05:01.560 --> 01:05:09.160
the stateliness all comes to you once for all. It's beautiful! Sacrifice doesn't become a sacrifice anymore, it's joy.

01:05:09.380 --> 01:05:14.580
Sacrifice means a joyous thing that you should be able to sacrifice. But that doesn't mean you give

01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:19.300
all your money to your guru or something like that - never. Sacrifice doesn't mean that nonsense.

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:24.120
So, you don't give. What you give is the sacrifice of the time.

01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:30.220
You have to sacrifice so-called time that is so important to you. Like these days people have watches.

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:37.760
In modern times people have watches - they must see watch, they must know about time - saving time, saving time, saving time for what?

01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:43.660
For spending in your meditation, spending in doing God's work - it is for that.

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.560
People are unemployed for doing God's work - simple as that. .

01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:52.280
If you get unemployed, you do God's work and you get employment as well as do God's work.

01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:59.700
In London which is, I mean England is you know, full of unemployment but not a single sahaja yogi is unemployed

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:05.400
and he's also doing God's work. And God's work is nothing to be done much, nothing to be done much

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.980
but to be one with God is the point. If you're one with God -

01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:14.620
[UNCLEAR - BUT?] then the work is done by God. Now what is it doing? This is doing nothing. It's just in between

01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:21.640
but it is doing a work. If it is not there, you may not hear Me. So, in a way it is doing the work but it is not doing - it is a hollow thing.

01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:28.920
That's how you become hollow personality and you start working for God - it's so enjoyable, life is so enjoyable.

01:06:29.120 --> 01:06:34.540
Life is for you for enjoyment and not for becoming miserable or unhappy.

01:06:34.800 --> 01:06:41.780
But you become, first of all you have to become that. Unless and until you become that all My promises are false. To become

01:06:41.980 --> 01:06:46.320
is a desire must come from you - we cannot force you - I've told you many a times.

01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.280
And again I request you, the desire has to pulled up. Because of your conditionings,

01:06:51.480 --> 01:06:56.340
because of other lethargies that you have, because of many other books you have read

01:06:56.540 --> 01:07:03.020
or maybe I don't know what you have done but some people are really lethargic towards their ascent, they're really very sluggish.

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.220
That's how they do not rise while some people rise very fast

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:13.500
and they come up very fast and they do very well. So, one has to take advantage of the time.

01:07:13.900 --> 01:07:19.040
so that you are used for the rest of the world and that you're helpful to everyone.

01:07:19.260 --> 01:07:26.480
Sahaja yoga is not for one person. It is for the whole society, for the whole world and for the emancipation of humanity.

01:07:26.720 --> 01:07:34.020
This is what is already described in so many books, in scriptures but for that you are chosen,

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:40.280
you are the one who's doing it. So, understand your own responsibility, understand your own powers

01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:47.620
and don't come now for, "Treat me this and Mother treat me for that. My mother's, mother's father's uncle's this thing

01:07:47.860 --> 01:07:53.600
is sick there." Don't worry on this point. First you get all right - get all right means you meditate.

01:07:53.860 --> 01:07:57.560
Now those who are sick here need not come out with their sickness at all.

01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:02.700
They will be told how to get their sickness all right. They themselves can treat it - I don't have to treat you.

01:08:03.160 --> 01:08:07.740
But once you are treated keep to certain limits. If you go beyond limits then you're caught up.

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:15.200
Say you are in the limit of this hall, you're sitting here and there are all negativities all around, all right.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:21.880
Now, if you leave this, you catch it. So, keep your limits. not that you become a sort of a rabid

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:26.100
sahaja yogi - not, doesn't mean that, but keep your limits, [UNCLEAR] don't do wrong things.

01:08:26.460 --> 01:08:32.100
As I told you, there was a fellow, who was suffering from AIDS, was cured by sahaja yoga - actually I never touched him.

01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:39.760
But he did come to see Me, that's all - was sitting with a hands towards Me, My photograph and all that. He was completely cured but again he did the same thing.

01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:45.520
He didn't do any work for sahaja yoga, in the sense he never came to see people, nothing of the kind - again he got it.

01:08:45.980 --> 01:08:50.760
There are many people who got realization and then they get cancer. So they said, "Mother, how did we get cancer?"

01:08:50.980 --> 01:08:54.720
Because you never tried to look after your self.

01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:03.640
So, you're just the same and you're not helped nor - sometimes you can be even worse, you see, because the Divine doesn't like this.

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:10.800
It has spent some time on you, it has worked on you - it's not easy to raise the Kundalini of so many people with such complications.

01:09:11.120 --> 01:09:15.700
It's like a mountain you have to raise - you get so tired sometimes. So, one has to understand

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:21.500
that somebody who respects our personality, respects our ascent, loves us so much

01:09:21.780 --> 01:09:25.700
we should also show some interest in ourselves. So, that is the wisdom

01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:31.740
one has to have and one has to work hard because you are all sages of the ancient times you're not sages today.

01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:36.500
Only thing God of men have to become prophets and have to give

01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:42.300
realizations to others so that they become prophets as said by William Blake.

01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:48.040
Now, I think, today I've spoken quite a lot. I would like to have some questions from the new people

01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:54.260
but sensible questions not aggressive questions because this place is not for aggression - is for love.

01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:57.420
May God bless you!

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:04.980
Any questions?

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:11.340
[INAUDIBLE] 
- Yes, yes I'll pass it on to Her.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:16.940
- Can any mentally ill person be helped? 
- Can a mentally ill person be helped?

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:21.900
Again, you will start making list of all kinds of patients of the world.

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:28.400
It's typical. When you come to sahaja yoga think of yourself. Do you think are you all right - you're not.

01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:36.540
See, we're not to open a hospital - that's one thing. Of course mentally, can be all right - retarded.

01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:41.480
But first you be all right. First you pay attention to yourself - that's the point I'm trying to make.

01:10:41.740 --> 01:10:48.740
Do you see? Don't miss the point. First you get well yourself, you become equipped then you can cure a mental

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:52.640
equipped person, mentally retarded person - now how?

01:10:53.580 --> 01:11:00.320
Our attitude is like this, you see, that we have somebody in mind

01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:08.300
say, somebody very close my child or someone - [UNCLEAR] so we come to sahaja yoga

01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:16.660
So we think that, "Will the mentally be this thing, then I will get my ascent - if the child could be cured."

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:22.720
Now, the child is sick all right but you are all right. It's your life that's important.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:26.720
First see that you get to it and then you cure your child.

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:33.220
But if you come in a circuitous way, Divine also finds devious ways of running away from you.

01:11:33.480 --> 01:11:37.640
Take a straightforward thing - I want realization for myself.

01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:42.160
How many children we have had in previous lives, how many husbands, how many wives?

01:11:42.380 --> 01:11:46.300
Why worry about these? First of all worry about yourself, "What am I?"

01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:54.220
But when, you'll be surprised, when you become established yourself, you become the citizen

01:11:54.420 --> 01:12:00.080
and your dependents are looked after by Divine, no doubt, they are looked after, they're blessed by the Divine.

01:12:00.180 --> 01:12:04.420
Is a fact you will see yourself but first of all you enter into it.

01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:11.760
So, don't worry about all kinds of problems and things I tell you 99% diseases can be cured, 99%

01:12:11.980 --> 01:12:16.880
But that's not important - just now, you should be all right, you should be the light, all right.

01:12:18.200 --> 01:12:25.740
-Yes. 
- Can I ask a personal question about myself [UNCLEAR] and I have  a

01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:33.880
nerve pinched on the [UNCLEAR] of the skull [UNCLEAR] going down

01:12:34.100 --> 01:12:38.960
the neck one to the arm and [UNCLEAR] to the hand

01:12:39.180 --> 01:12:43.640
therefore is making the hand tremor. Tremors can be cured?

01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:47.720
Yes, it can be. All right, done.

01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:54.100
[LAUGHTER] It can be but you have to come here to know how to get yourself cured.

01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:59.060
As you go to a doctor you come here and whatever they say you do it - it can be cured.

01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:04.560
It has been cured, it will be cured so you just don't have to worry, it can be done

01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:10.420
but it does not mean that you come for that. Your Kundalini has to be raised and then the Kundalini will do it.

01:13:10.600 --> 01:13:14.640
So you come here as you go to any doctor. Now the trouble is

01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:19.000
when they go to a doctor they pay so much money - I'm just telling a general, not for you but general -

01:13:19.440 --> 01:13:23.980
they'll have to wait outside, for three hours they'll wait there, pay the doctor

01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:29.240
but here, if they have to wait even for five minutes, they start shouting. See you have no right

01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:36.200
that you should ask for the blessings but it is the Grace of God that it is going to bless you, all right.

01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:41.980
So, come with a humble mind that you should be cured and it can be easily cured. What else?

01:13:42.220 --> 01:13:46.980
Can anyone [UNCLEAR] ?

01:13:47.140 --> 01:13:50.600
Can anyone be realized without knowing about Kundalini?

01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:56.980
About mentally need not know much, it can be realized, of course you can be.

01:13:57.160 --> 01:14:01.860
But, then you have to tell them what it is, this thing is better to do that way.

01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:07.280
But there will be very few who will accept such a situation because they want to know about everything.

01:14:07.640 --> 01:14:14.580
But they need not know all that, you can little bit say, tell them that there is a way of getting realization

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:20.000
and then it's like this that when you come to Me, you want to have the lights, I'll say all right,

01:14:20.180 --> 01:14:25.020
go there's a switch you put on and you put on the switch, you get the lights without telling about it.

01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:31.660
But you would like to know how this light is done and then that helps you to create other lights.

01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:37.660
That's why, it is important to know about Kundalini. I would, I can do it without telling you anything

01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:43.140
about Kundalini, I can raise your Kundalini but you would not know anything about and you would not know what it is

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:48.240
It has happened with many who were born realized - they did not know they were realized souls

01:14:48.440 --> 01:14:52.540
and they got lost. Like I would say, greatest example, Leonardo da Vinci.

01:14:53.920 --> 01:14:58.880
Leonardo da Vinci  was a realized soul  and he got lost because he didn't know he was a

01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:04.120
realized soul, he was a higher personality than others, he got lost. So many got lost like that.

01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:13.480
Excuse me, if your Kundalini was arisen and that happened to be lost, I mean, you have it and it happened to be lost

01:15:13.700 --> 01:15:17.080
How can you get lost if the Kundalini has been awakened?

01:15:17.280 --> 01:15:23.700
It is, because, you see, it is, you're not yet fully developed matured person.

01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:31.060
When you are in an immature state it does happen. Kundalini is, when it rises, you'll be surprised, in some people it is just a wee bit,

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:36.320
just like a hair, just comes up a little bit because it's so difficult, you see, the passage is so blocked

01:15:36.460 --> 01:15:43.460
so a little bit comes up. This is what it is. It is, a complete realization takes place only when you are Nirvikalpa samadhi -

01:15:43.660 --> 01:15:48.080
- that's a higher state. So in the beginning it's just a little wee bit opens up and

01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:56.060
one percent people do get lost, they do, because they have egos, they have superegos or all kinds of things - they do get lost - so be careful.

01:15:58.360 --> 01:16:03.080
- Whatever is the fact. 
- Can we all become fully realized in this life?

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:07.540
I wish everybody could but how many would be there - see in Melbourne how many people there are

01:16:07.780 --> 01:16:10.980
but how many come to the program and how many come here.

01:16:11.240 --> 01:16:16.200
- In this lifetime 
- Can it be done in this life? 
- Of course can be done but

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.420
without their knowledge to give them realization is not possible. They have to know it

01:16:20.620 --> 01:16:25.320
that they are in for realization, they have to ask for it  - you cannot mesmerize.

01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:30.940
You have to tell them this is , I'm going to give you realization - this you have to tell them -

01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.960
you have to take their permission, cannot just do without their permission -

01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:39.680
But he's saying can we achieve it.  Once we get the hair's breadth can it be something that we could ...[INAUDIBLE]

01:16:39.860 --> 01:16:46.640
Oh I see, you're saying, yes of course, of course that's what I'm saying, doesn't matter hair's breadth. In some people it is hair breadth

01:16:46.860 --> 01:16:53.860
in some people it's quite a lot. It can, everybody can achieve it, no doubt that's what I'm saying but in the beginning sometimes it can be

01:16:54.060 --> 01:16:58.680
very small and then people lose it. See now, yesterday

01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:05.940
at least I think, at least two hundred people got realization, at least two hundred, out of which about hundred are here.

01:17:06.740 --> 01:17:12.600
So you can imagine how they get lost, you see. You see they, they want some sort of a circus

01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:16.940
some sort of a nonsense before them - they're used to that na.

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:24.300
They got realization - no doubt they got it - but no they didn't come. Hmm..

01:17:26.380 --> 01:17:34.260
- Now, what is it? 
- I was at your tonight when I got realization but

01:17:34.480 --> 01:17:39.080
when I was born on the family of my mother, I was born a clairvoyant

01:17:39.460 --> 01:17:45.220
- Boy, what? 
- He was born a clairvoyant. He said he felt his realization the other night

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:49.220
- I [UNCLEAR] want to be a clairvoyant 
- He doesn't want to be a clairvoyant

01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:58.140
[LAUGHTER N CLAPS]

01:17:59.180 --> 01:18:02.460
You see, clairvoyant is also two types of things -

01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:08.620
you see, there's one who could be a realized soul, born realized soul. He's not clairvoyant but

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:14.500
such a person can heal, such a person knows more than other's know, can be more creative,

01:18:14.680 --> 01:18:21.120
may be more successful. So many things are there with a person who is a born realized as I told you - many were like that.

01:18:23.080 --> 01:18:29.580
But, or could be the other way, that those who are born and trying to be something artificially

01:18:29.820 --> 01:18:34.900
then these spirits come in and they make them clairvoyant. So forget it whatever has happened.

01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:40.680
There's no need to have any clairvoyance any more. You become the owner of that power

01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:47.080
which you know how to maneuver, what it is, how it comes, how it works, everything, so you become a knowledgeable person - an expert.

01:18:48.340 --> 01:18:55.140
Actually I was the same, I had the same ability. As soon as Mother worked on this chakra I lost that thing

01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:59.040
- It happened within days of [UNCLEAR] 
- It's a very

01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:04.220
Ah.. stro..  Hmm,

01:19:06.260 --> 01:19:12.340
If a person gets realization does he [UNCLEAR - DEPICT?] his karma and the [UNCLEAR - INCARNATION?]

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:20.140
Oh! Now the, when the Kundalini rises above the Agnya chakra, as I told you, it sucks your ego and superego

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:28.260
so by, by this it sucks in your karmas, it sucks in your kusanskaras,

01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:35.700
it sucks in your so called sins. So there is no one. You see, for an animal there is nothing like karma.

01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:46.220
Say a lion has to eat a cow, it eats - it has to eat.

01:19:47.040 --> 01:19:53.620
It doesn't feel it has done some, committed some sin. Have you seen any dog feeling that he's committed some sins

01:19:53.820 --> 01:20:02.360
or sulking? Maybe a dog because he lives with human beings so might [LAUGHTER]

01:20:02.940 --> 01:20:09.140
But animals do what they have to do, they don't carry on with it, they don't commit any sins - nothing.

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:14.600
The idea of sin has come to us, is because of our ignorance

01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:20.360
and because people have said that if you do like this

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:27.560
then you are crossing your limits, you're going to adharma. That why this idea has come to us.

01:20:27.900 --> 01:20:35.900
But that's what Kundalini is. When she touches this chakra of Mahavishnu, she sucks in all that is

01:20:37.500 --> 01:20:45.060
there - that's the beauty of Kundalini is and you're no more, no more, with your ego or superego -

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:49.420
so how can you be any more sinful or the karmas are finished.

01:20:51.640 --> 01:21:00.200
On the contrary if you try to cleanse your karmas - you see, I've done bad karmas so I should do this and do that - you build up your ego

01:21:00.500 --> 01:21:06.700
because ego is there. Whatever you do in the name of God, in the name of anything, what you do is to

01:21:09.400 --> 01:21:14.500
just pamper your ego. Even if you're not

01:21:16.700 --> 01:21:22.500
aware of it, it is there. Those people who do missionary work, you must go and see them how they live. They're extremely

01:21:22.760 --> 01:21:28.660
hot tempered ladies, hot tempered men - I know of somebody who has got a peace prize but if you see the person heat,

01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:33.280
terrible heat - all the wrinkles you can count one by one on the face.

01:21:34.820 --> 01:21:39.780
Because you think, you see, you're conscious that it is done by me.

01:21:45.860 --> 01:21:48.960
All right! Any other question? [UNCLEAR - WHAT?]

01:21:49.240 --> 01:21:57.100
I also [UNCLEAR] your lecture on Friday night [UNCLEAR] sometime

01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:02.720
- All right [UNCLEAR] 
- since Friday [UNCLEAR] question to my family [UNCLEAR]

01:22:03.060 --> 01:22:08.880
I had heard a lot but it's also [UNCLEAR] and I'm worried about this [UNCLEAR]

01:22:09.080 --> 01:22:15.620
Good, I'm glad you raised that question. She came to your program, she felt tremendous [UNCLEAR]

01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:22.040
awareness and growth and she felt a great deal of love for her family

01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:27.200
but she's also aware that maybe she's going to feel apart  from them

01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:34.560
- or they perhaps apart from her. 
- No, you don't get involved into them, that's the point.

01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:39.360
You're not apart, you're part and parcel but you're not involved. Say, supposing your child is sick,

01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:45.420
take it like this, and if you're involved with the child then you cannot treat the child.

01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:53.580
You get so upset, you see, if you have to go to the hospital that side you'll take your car the other side

01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:58.460
because you're so upset. But when you're detached you see the whole thing very well

01:22:58.740 --> 01:23:04.780
and you enjoy their love much more because you are in a position to see that love

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:10.400
otherwise you don't see love. When you're involved you don't see anything.

01:23:12.460 --> 01:23:19.180
- Maybe we feel as though we may drift away from... 
- No, no, not at all, not at all, not at all.

01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:25.220
on the contrary so many families have come round, so many. You see, we had some people in

01:23:25.700 --> 01:23:33.180
England they were mostly hippies and had left their parents, this, that - they all went back to their parents -

01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:39.960
they brought their parents to sahaja yoga also. Yes, it's not like that but

01:23:40.180 --> 01:23:46.160
you do not take unnecessary burdens. Now supposing, somebody's father is a drunkard - we had one hippy

01:23:46.340 --> 01:23:51.060
who got alright and then he became very good. Now he's doing very well in life, he's very good fellow

01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:58.420
- so he went home and his father used to drink, drink, drink and he was worried this fellow is going to die after about alcoholism -

01:23:58.620 --> 01:24:05.680
so he didn't know what to do. So he told him, "Don't drink better take to sahaja yoga, if your Kundalini is raised you will not drink."

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:11.960
"But I like it," he said. "All right." So next he went he broke all his glasses and bottles.

01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:18.460
So when he came home he got very angry. He just kept quiet,this... just laughed. He said, " You go and get some bottle from outside."

01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:22.920
Then, he was already so drunk he couldn't go out anywhere, you see,

01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:28.300
and gradually he found that there's a kind of a protest from the family, they don't like it.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:32.260
the way he's drinking - he gave up and he himself is a sahaja yogi today.

01:24:32.620 --> 01:24:39.320
So you correct. When we're involved we don't even want to correct because we're frightened we'll lose our children, lose our love and all that.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:47.540
This is no love. Love must prune a person, love must correct a person but in a way that is not so aggressive - in a simple way.

01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:52.120
And the fellow is saved, he would have been dead  with alcoholism, he was about to die.

01:24:52.380 --> 01:24:57.920
So the real love comes, is not indulgences by seeing the person as he is.

01:24:58.120 --> 01:25:02.460
Then you enjoy all the beauties, little, little things that are done how it's bubbling with joy

01:25:02.580 --> 01:25:06.560
and happiness - you see the other person better. But if you're involved

01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:13.240
then you can be also selfish, it could be some sort of a possessiveness, can be anything

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:17.800
but if you're not, you see yourself and you see them - the love is much more.

01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:22.020
There should be some distance for the love to work out, isn't it.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:26.440
If you're involved, they are doomed and you are doomed - sort of a position is there.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:33.500
So, it's very good that has happened to you - now you can love them better, much better, in a much more sensible way.

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:42.060
Love has to be nourishing not destroying. Mostly you find when you love your children, so called those who love,

01:25:42.260 --> 01:25:50.020
spoil them. If you love your wife beyond certain limits she becomes a shrew, if you love your husband he becomes alcoholic - like that.

01:25:50.580 --> 01:25:55.620
Love always, in the right sense, means correction.

01:25:55.880 --> 01:25:59.800
But if not, some people say, "All right my husband likes this, doesn't matter."

01:25:59.980 --> 01:26:04.220
Even in England some women say, "All right if he wants to have a keep let him have, I love him."

01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.920
Can you imagine? "Because I love him let him do what he likes."

01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.220
Losing all your self respect, everything,  in the name of love, is nonsense.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:20.400
Any other question? Annh..

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:24.200
[UNCLEAR AND INAUDIBLE] one should eat to help realization

01:26:24.460 --> 01:26:30.200
Other certain foods you should eat to help the self- realization - other certain foods.

01:26:30.440 --> 01:26:37.600
No, no, certain foods hain ? Hun.. [LAUGHTER] I heard

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:45.080
[LAUGHTER] I'm sorry, I misheard - the foods.

01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:50.180
Ah..no,  you see it is like this, I'll tell you.

01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:57.880
It's very simple to understand that food is for our body we are not for the food.

01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:04.040
Now some people require some type of food, some people require some type of food.

01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:11.220
For example, a person, who requires more proteins, must eat meat, no doubt, must eat fish.

01:27:11.720 --> 01:27:15.260
What's the use of saving all the chickens, am I going to give them realization?

01:27:15.460 --> 01:27:23.160
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.140
But do you know, that in evolution when you eat the chicken, the chicken has a higher possibility.

01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:36.880
[LAUGHTER]

01:27:37.080 --> 01:27:42.980
So, not such facts but for some people it suits them

01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:49.460
vegetarian food because they have eaten too much of protein, just too much of it, they have certain problems

01:27:49.620 --> 01:27:55.760
so they should take to vegetarian for the time being till they correct - there is no fixed food for anyone.

01:27:56.180 --> 01:28:02.640
But for liver patients, now example, here now another fad is nobody should take sugar

01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:09.240
now for liver patients that's the only solution - if you don't take sugar you're going to go out

01:28:09.460 --> 01:28:16.260
absolutely very soon, so then you have to take sugar for liver who are active - those who are, whose liver is active.

01:28:16.460 --> 01:28:21.820
It is depend on what sort of a personality you are, what sort of a food will correct.

01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:27.540
Till you get a balanced personality you have to balance yourself out. But there's no hard and fast rule about it.

01:28:27.780 --> 01:28:31.100
You can eat everything but you don't eat the meat of a bigger animal

01:28:31.340 --> 01:28:39.560
because the muscles of a bigger animal are bigger than our muscular system our, annh we can say the

01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:47.980
microscopically if you see your muscle system, your muscles are much smaller than that of, say for, a horse

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:55.260
but people like to eat horse, elephants, all those things - there is no need to eat all that because it is

01:28:55.680 --> 01:29:01.260
Then, then you will have, there will be no evolution for you neither for them.

01:29:01.420 --> 01:29:04.840
So is not to eat because that makes your muscles odd, funny

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:09.480
so, that's why you have to eat something that is smaller than you, is all right,

01:29:09.700 --> 01:29:15.940
no difference but that doesn't also mean that I'm saying you must eat - may have to eat, may not have to eat.

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:22.180
We have a community in India which is called Jains, they, some of them have gone to such absurd limit

01:29:22.380 --> 01:29:29.540
that in vegetarianism, if I tell you you will be shocked, that in a village they collect all the bugs,

01:29:29.780 --> 01:29:36.420
all the bugs of the village and get a Brahmin because Brahmin is never a Jain, he's a Hindu, so they put him

01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:42.580
in a hut, put all the bugs there - the bugs have to suck in the blood of that Brahmin

01:29:42.780 --> 01:29:49.160
and they're rich people, Jains are, so when the bugs are all dropped out of the body then they give money to the

01:29:49.340 --> 01:29:55.640
Brahmin so they have saved so many bugs - that's what it is, so this is absurd.

01:29:55.800 --> 01:30:03.840
We don't go to any absurdities in sahaja yoga. We have to be extremely normal, simple, pleasant, loving people.

01:30:05.280 --> 01:30:08.280
Now, yes.

01:30:08.500 --> 01:30:15.340
Mother, you mentioned before people going to hell. I'm sorry I asked this question, it's negative,

01:30:15.720 --> 01:30:20.660
quite don't understand the concept of Hell. Can somebody be..?

01:30:20.920 --> 01:30:25.960
- Umm, health, Hell? 
- You mentioned in your lecture about people going to Hell

01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:30.840
He doesn't understand this concept - how can people go to Hell - he just doesn't understand.

01:30:31.040 --> 01:30:36.020
Oh, it is something in the house you have something for like a bathroom, isn't it?

01:30:36.880 --> 01:30:44.160
In the same way people have to go to Hell - you must read books to understand - all the great scriptures have described it.

01:30:44.400 --> 01:30:49.880
Mahavira has described it at length what Hell is. People have to go to Hell, they have to ,

01:30:50.060 --> 01:30:54.540
they're so troublesome. Do you think Hitler has to enter into the Kingdom of God, should he?

01:30:54.760 --> 01:31:01.820
There's no sympathy for such people - God is wrathful. He sends such people to Hell, no doubt, He there is a Hell.

01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:07.920
If you think there is no Hell then you're living in a Paradise which doesn't exist, believe Me.

01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:14.220
There is a Hell. If you do wrong things, if you try to torture others, if you try to extract

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:19.980
all that what God has given to this world, then, you're to be punished and God punishes.

01:31:20.160 --> 01:31:24.700
Or anybody who says there is no Hell, know that that person Himself is from Hell.

01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:29.120
Believe Me, it is not so, I must warn you - there is Hell. there are people who say

01:31:29.120 --> 01:31:34.600
nobody is bad, everybody is good, everybody could be good - it's not true, is not true.

01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:41.560
There are so many devils already existing - what do you think of so many these fake gurus what are they?

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:51.980
They're all devils, they're all punished in their own ways and devils are devils, no doubt about it.

01:31:52.800 --> 01:31:55.860
[UNCLEAR] eternal Hell?

01:31:56.720 --> 01:32:01.820
Well is a concept, I mean, do you believe in eternal Hell? I wish there was one.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:06.820
[LAUGHTER]

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:13.940
There should be one for such people they again and again come back. [LAUGHTER]

01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:22.060
[LAUGHTER] One gets fed up with them [LAUGHTER]

01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:26.500
- [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] Yes?

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:33.580
- Does Arthritis in the Sacrum hinder the rising of the[UNCLEAR] Kundalini?

01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:36.840
- Sorry, does.. 
- Arthritis on the..

01:32:36.980 --> 01:32:42.280
- Sacrum 
- [UNCLEAR] Yeah 
- Does arthritis in the Sacrum hinder the rising of the Kundalini?

01:32:42.500 --> 01:32:46.980
Should not. Arthritis is absolutely curable. Anybody who has arthritis we can cure.

01:32:47.240 --> 01:32:53.260
The other day I saw one sahaja yogi with arthritis, why don't you cure him, it's very simple? You know how to cure arthritis, it's very simple.

01:32:53.460 --> 01:32:59.660
It's very, very simple. Actually a person who has arthritis is a good person, normally, is a good person

01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:06.440
has vibrations but is triggered by some sort of a possession or something or kill, chill or some neglect of the body

01:33:06.620 --> 01:33:11.760
can be easily cured - arthritis is absolutely curable. Arthritis doesn't stop the Kundalini rising but

01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:18.820
supposing if you had a bad accident, you are just laid down in bed, I mean you are absolutely a gone case and all that then naturally,

01:33:19.020 --> 01:33:26.500
it is better to take another life, you see, than to make My hands pain, everybody's hands pain working on a case like that.

01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:32.860
You must know that God has got common sense, has lots of common sense.

01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:38.640
I mean, get common sense from Him. Like the light which is not going to give any light,

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:43.840
any lamp that is not going to be of any use we just don't - we put it in the junk.

01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:50.900
So is better for such a person to take birth again but arthritis is not a disease, it's not a disease at all.

01:33:51.220 --> 01:33:57.380
It can be cured - have you got arthritis? It can be cured, absolutely curable.

01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:02.920
You take out your shoes, put your hands towards Me, just now, take out your shoes.

01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:09.080
Put something for her, some sort of a warm thing. Can you put this, can you put this under her feet?

01:34:09.580 --> 01:34:16.740
The one, no, on which you are sitting. Hmm. It is curable.

01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:25.700
It's all right - need not take out that. Let it be, let her not take out socks.

01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:32.620
Put your left hand towards Me and right hand out and don't write anything anymore now, just

01:34:33.040 --> 01:34:37.660
just - the arthritis is here, where do you have arthritis?

01:34:40.100 --> 01:34:43.600
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- In the Sacrum

01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:47.140
- All right, now put your left hand towards Me 
- Lumbar, Lumbar

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:53.760
All right,  now you just sit down right hand like this towards the Mother Earth, no, left. Just tell her how to do it.

01:34:53.960 --> 01:34:57.240
- Left hand towards Mother and right hand on Mother Earth. 
- Yes.

01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:02.600
And one sahaja yogi should put your hand on her Sacrum and put the other on the Mother Earth - finished.

01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:05.840
You can take it out, anybody.

01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:12.140
Haan. That's better

01:35:16.800 --> 01:35:22.380
Simple as that. Any other question?

01:35:23.840 --> 01:35:31.620
[UNCLEAR] I cannot [UNCLEAR]

01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:37.580
He finds he can't sleep very well, he lies there, he can't turn his brain off, he tosses and turns.

01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:45.860
All right, there's a screw here [LAUGHTER] Just come I'll put it right. Come along

01:35:46.540 --> 01:35:49.520
[UNCLEAR] here now.

01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:54.000
[LAUGHTER] Actually there is

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:07.140
- Just sit down in front of Her. 
- What do you do? You are a.. physical work

01:36:07.380 --> 01:36:10.660
- Yeah, I'm a shift worker. 
- Annh? 
- shift worker, used to be a weight lifter

01:36:10.860 --> 01:36:14.660
- He used to be a weight lifter now he's a shift worker. 
- Weight lifting

01:36:14.900 --> 01:36:20.620
[LAUGHTER] So very right sided person, all right  come forward.

01:36:20.860 --> 01:36:26.360
- [UNCLEAR] so She can touch [UNCLEAR] 
- Put your right hand towards Me and left hand on the Mother Earth, as it is it will work out

01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.880
then maybe, I'll see the screw, all right. Now, what else?

01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:41.000
Main bahut saal se [UNCLEAR] Ma ki sirf prarthana karta rehta huun but ekagrata se nahin hoti.

01:36:41.260 --> 01:36:45.520
Achcha ab poocho tum, Ma ko kaunsi, Durga ko maante ho?

01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:50.800
- Nahin, main Gayatri Ma ki puja karta huun 
- Achcha to Gayatri sirf ek side hai na, saari Ma ko maana chahiye

01:36:51.140 --> 01:36:58.180
Ma aisi baat hai aise main kisi Ma ko neglect nahin karta par ek baat hai ki hamesha do ghanta karta rehta huun

01:36:58.360 --> 01:37:02.300
- par jitni lagan se aur jitni ekagrata se 
- Gayatri bahut zyada bhi karna theek nahin hai na

01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:07.840
Achcha aap right hand Meri ore karo aur left hand zameen pe karke. Right hand Meri taraf karo, aise haath rakho zameen par rakho, aise

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:13.480
nahin aise rakho apni god mein. Aaram se god mein rakho, aaram se jisse aaaram se baith sako, aaram se.

01:37:13.720 --> 01:37:19.600
Aur poora haath aap zameen par rakho, left hand. Achcha ab tum sawaal poocho, "Ma aap swayam sakshat Gayatri ho kya?" Aisa sawaal poocho Mujhse.

01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:24.080
Ma Aap saakshat Gayatri, Aap sakshat  swayam Gayatri ho kya?

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.760
- Again, poocho teen baar 
-  Aap saakshat  swayam Gayatri ho kya?

01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:32.660
- Hmm. 
-  Aap saakshat swayam Gayatri ho kya?

01:37:33.860 --> 01:37:36.300
- Aaya? 
-Nahin Ma

01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.980
Dekho bahut zyada tumne istemaal kiya right side.

01:37:40.180 --> 01:37:45.780
Yahi tumhare liye mantra hai ki, "Ma Aap swayam saakshat Gayatri hain?" Woh kada zara nikaal lo ek minute haath se aur kaho

01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:51.040
"Ma Aap swayam saakshat Gayatri," mann mein kaho, abhi shuru ho jayega. Mann mein kehte raho.

01:37:52.840 --> 01:37:57.000
- Can anything be done for right hand [UNCLEAR] 
- What's it?

01:37:57.320 --> 01:38:01.980
[LAUGHTER] It's the same one that asked the question before.

01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.960
- Can anything be done to the numbness in his right hand? 
- Yes, yes right hand or left hand?

01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:12.400
All right, come along [LAUGHTER]

01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:18.640
Yes, sit down, sit down anywhere - anywhere you can sit down.

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.800
Now, where have you been, to which guru?

01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.180
- Not a guru uhh... 
- Someone like that

01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:31.340
[UNCLEAR] the doctors [UNCLEAR]

01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:38.580
[LAUGHTER] That's how you got it. All right, so put left hand towards Me right hand on the Mother Earth.

01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:42.580
Left hand towards Me right hand.. Can you put a light for him? Just arrange

01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:49.960
You can, you can go at the back and they'll arrange it for you. All right how to sit down. Give him, give him something like that to sit down - same style. Hmm..

01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:53.800
All right, anybody else?

01:38:54.700 --> 01:39:01.180
Better is now. All right, better - see, no more weight lifting.

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:04.780
[LAUGHTER] - Hann, aa raha hai? Aise haath rakho.

01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:09.680
- Ma aaya, aaya ka matlab main nahin samjha. 
- Haath mein thandak si aayegi

01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:13.060
- Haan. 
- Aa rahi hai? Bas theek hai. Kaam ban raha hai.

01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:22.220
Everybody should put their hands out towards Mother.

01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:28.380
Now, you do one thing. First of all you put your left hand towards Me and right hand on the Mother Earth.

01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.320
Like this, flat on the earth put your right hand left hand towards Mother.

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:40.540
Those who are sitting at a higher level can do this way, is to put left hand towards Me and like that towards the Mother Earth.

01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:44.660
If you're on a chair just put your right hand towards the earth.

01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:48.620
Are you getting a cool breeze in the hand? Not yet.

01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:52.320
- [UNCLEAR] 
- Little bit 
- Light, very vague, I'm not sure if it's cool

01:39:52.580 --> 01:39:58.080
- Now, are you getting cool breeze? 
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- That's it, let it work out

01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:04.840
- On this finger 
- Yeah, [UNCLEAR] 
- All right.

01:40:05.060 --> 01:40:09.560
- Mataji mere haath bahut bhaari lagte hain. 
- Hot aa raha hai?

01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.040
- Hot nahin, bahut bhaari hai 
- Left hand? 
- Left hand

01:40:13.260 --> 01:40:16.040
- Kisi guru uru ke pass gaye the kya? 
- Nahi ji

01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:20.800
Kya karte hain ghar mein? Aap joote Meri taraf karke baithe hain, aap Hindustani hain, samajh lijiye

01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:25.920
to aur kya hoga.Haan aise nahi baith sakte Ma ki taraf. Haan seedhe se baithiye

01:40:26.240 --> 01:40:30.760
Can't sit like that, you see, haan. Ab nahi lag raha bhaari?

01:40:32.400 --> 01:40:38.240
Dekha? Gaya bhaaripan - Ma ki taraf pair nahi karke baith sakte.

01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.880
You can't sit with the feet towards Me.

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:50.420
You see, it really showed to the Indian girls because Indians know this but you don't know so it didn't show but you're not supposed to do that.

01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:55.240
But I don't tell anybody if I tell anybody they'll say, " Oh, this lady thinks no end of Herself."

01:40:55.740 --> 01:41:01.900
Typical, that's a fact - theek hai na ab? Gaya bhaaripan - dekho.

01:41:04.040 --> 01:41:09.080
When You mentioned [UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE] my mother thinks that she suffers very badly, I'm trying to

01:41:09.380 --> 01:41:15.140
- In fact I write her to come here tonight. She said [UNCLEAR] 
- All right

01:41:15.420 --> 01:41:21.800
All right you get her here, you get her cured, arthritis is curable but first you should be all right yourself.

01:41:22.020 --> 01:41:28.500
You see because you take over. You see, you become a doctor and you treat your mother you can be 24 hours available to her, isn't it?

01:41:29.040 --> 01:41:33.060
It's better that you do it than anybody else does that.

01:41:33.280 --> 01:41:38.300
- If we go to this organization last week, is it all right? I mean is it 
- Which organization?

01:41:38.540 --> 01:41:42.800
- the spiritualist [UNCLEAR] 
- Oh, is it all right if they continue to go to the spiritualist union?

01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:48.780
Of course not [LAUGHTER]. That's how she got it - your mother used to go there?

01:41:49.020 --> 01:41:53.760
Ah, that's it, that's it, that's it.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:42:00.200
I mean if you go to spirits, who are dead spirits, who enter into us through the collective sub-conscious

01:42:00.440 --> 01:42:06.240
I mean one can end up with cancer minimum - horrible!

01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:13.520
It's like, sitting in a boat trying to save yourself and putting your foot in the mouth of a crocodile.

01:42:13.860 --> 01:42:19.600
[LAUGHTER]

01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:24.180
- What if she [UNCLEAR] sake of learning? 
- Unnh?

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:28.820
- What if she got of the Victorians [UNCLEAR] union to the sake of learning?

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:34.040
- I didn't follow. 
- What if you to these spiritualists people for the sake of learning?

01:42:34.340 --> 01:42:40.940
What do you learn, all their vidyas, bhoot vidya - What they know is - [ ASIDE - JUST PUT THAT THING THERE]

01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:46.800
What do you learn - nothing. You learn nothing but you get all the bhoots in yourself like this.

01:42:47.020 --> 01:42:52.200
- Umm, you learn, ah.. 
- No, no, no don't talk. [LAUGHTER]

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:58.020
You don't learn anything, you get into troubles like this and then it becomes a trouble for others.

01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:04.960
- I got, I got this love in music. I got it [UNCLEAR] Victorian spiritualist 
- But, but all right you didn't get because of that

01:43:05.180 --> 01:43:11.740
but you can get. What I said was the words you must understand that if you go to such things you get into trouble like this.

01:43:12.000 --> 01:43:16.720
And now, it is going to be not very easy for us to cure, for the same reason

01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:21.520
because if you go to spirits it's like the one, your foot is in the crocodile's mouth, you see,

01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:28.820
and then how are we to cure you? You want you to be completely in the boat. All right, that's the point.

01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:33.380
I didn't say, it could be earlier you might have got it, I'm not saying

01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:39.120
because you got possessed somebody must have done it - there're so many things by which you get this. But, then,

01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:47.280
if you have been to these people, it is difficult, we can't work, our hands don't work - see the vibrations return back, they don't act.

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:52.720
See the point is like that - it takes more time. Better now?

01:43:52.920 --> 01:43:55.900
Theek hai chalne do. What else?

01:43:56.160 --> 01:44:04.220
[INAUDIBLE] the whole body is very [INAUDIBLE]

01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:09.860
- She's got a , she's got a problem of not been able to raise her arms. 
- Diabetic

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:13.880
- and she's diabetic. But this is small healing, you , you have, you

01:44:14.100 --> 01:44:21.100
All right, now all of you who have been here for healing, that's not good. I must have somebody sensible also here, isn't it? Someone,

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:28.180
- To now ask some sensible questions 
- No, no, that is all right, that is curable, Diabetes is curable, you come to the center they will tell you. Now, who else?

01:44:28.500 --> 01:44:33.620
If you achieve Self-realization in the life what becomes  of you when you die?

01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:38.060
If you achieve Self-realization in your life what happens when you die?

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:43.900
Actually, we shouldn't think of the future we should be in the present but even if you ask the question the thing is then you become

01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:49.580
empowered to decide if you want to be born again you can be born again, if you don't want you need not be.

01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:57.440
you can take your Nirvana but mostly all those who are great people want to take birth to save the world.

01:44:57.680 --> 01:45:00.980
So, you become empowered, you can decide for yourself.

01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:11.780
- Mother, 
- Yes 
- what is the easiest way to counteract negativity of other people around you.

01:45:12.100 --> 01:45:17.220
What's the easiest way to counteract negativity of other people around you?

01:45:17.440 --> 01:45:24.220
You see there are many ways by which - first of all you get your realization, all right? Once you're realized try to keep in thoughtless awareness.

01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:28.040
When you think of those people, if the thought comes to you, you should say,

01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:31.980
"I forgive, I forgive," that's the mantra for that - one of them in the thought process.

01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:38.080
But otherwise it can harmful to you - you write down their names in your hands and just move your hand like this -

01:45:38.460 --> 01:45:44.640
once, twice and thrice - it works. They don't trouble you any more.

01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:48.740
So many things will work out with this - you try this principle, it's very good.

01:45:48.980 --> 01:45:52.900
Uh.. I mean anything - this is we call as bandhan, we call it as the protection.

01:45:53.100 --> 01:45:59.900
So you write anything that you want to do, just put your hands like this - it works out, it's wonderful because the power is flowing through your finger -tips

01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:04.940
and you can manage it, anything, like that or so there are other ways by

01:46:05.120 --> 01:46:09.780
you can avoid but when you'll come next they will tell you how to do it. Now is better now?

01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:14.640
- I'm getting uncomfortable. 
- Uncomfortable, give him a this thing

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.800
- Now, much better now. 
- That's what it is - the Victoria has done

01:46:21.020 --> 01:46:26.580
[LAUGHTER] The Victoria Institute of Spirits - Poor Victoria queen, why to call her name, I don't know.

01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:34.940
- Any other question? 
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- They are all right, not you - Are you better, madam?

01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:41.400
Have you been to anybody like that - clairvoyant or someone, annh?

01:46:42.980 --> 01:46:47.320
- Take a candle for her 
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:46:47.620 --> 01:46:51.500
- Mother, 
- Hmm 
- one question is said how do you get this Self- realization?

01:46:51.680 --> 01:46:54.760
- I don't think  he came to the program 
- You didn't come to the program -

01:46:55.120 --> 01:46:58.260
- Put your hand up. 
- through Kundalini awakening.

01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:02.440
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- What process is it?

01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:09.940
The process is living process, spontaneous process of sprouting - just like a seed sprouts, the Kundalini sprouts out.

01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:13.440
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- How do you sprout a seed?

01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:24.320
It just works out. Haan better, see? Better.

01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:32.260
Thank God you did only weight lifting, but you had gone to an Institute like that, I would never have helped you so fast. [LAUGHTER]

01:47:32.500 --> 01:47:38.520
All right, now put your right hand towards Me all of you.

01:47:40.180 --> 01:47:45.720
and left hand like this, like this at the back - put it at the back.

01:47:53.160 --> 01:48:00.220
- Hmm, 
- It's flowing. 
- see the cool breeze coming in! It's there.

01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.680
See now! That's shaking before Me - that's Victoria Institution.

01:48:08.240 --> 01:48:14.640
- [LAUGHTER] 
- I may try 
- Haan all right, put your left hand

01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:20.560
- It's a possession 
- It's a possession 
- Just place it

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:28.360
That has to go first and then you will be all right. Hmm, all right?

01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:38.240
It'll clear out, it'll clear out, just do that way. It's like just the connection

01:48:38.520 --> 01:48:43.940
Now, if you are a right sided person, you're just putting like this - now you're connected. So what happens

01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:50.120
the vibrations start flowing through here clear your right side  completely and it goes into the

01:48:50.380 --> 01:48:54.700
atmosphere, into the Ether - we use the Ether, the Akaasha.

01:48:56.060 --> 01:49:02.820
And if you want to have better results, better use also the water.

01:49:03.100 --> 01:49:10.460
Such people who have right sided problems should sit in the water with a little salt. Those who have left sided problems should use the light.

01:49:10.740 --> 01:49:15.640
They'll tell you all about it you have to come back again. All right! if you don't mind!

01:49:16.040 --> 01:49:22.660
Good! Now you'll sleep like a log of wood, come along, now let Me [LAUGHTER]. Come forward.

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:29.900
Put your right hand towards Me, right hand towards Me. Close your eyes

01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:38.520
Forgive everyone. Theek hai aap. Ab Gayatri bund kariye - abhi yahan aake sahaja yoga seekho pehle phir samajh lo Gayatri kya cheez hai.

01:49:38.780 --> 01:49:46.060
Samyak gyan hona chahiye - must know integrated knowledge not just Gayatri somewhere something, all right! You come and know about it what is Gayatri

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:54.680
what is what, everything must be known - and you just start doing something with your own ideas, is not proper - you have to know.

01:49:56.060 --> 01:50:01.340
- Ma [INAUDIBLE] 
- Haan, wohi to, Brahmano ka dimaag issi se kharaab ho gaya hai.

01:50:02.720 --> 01:50:09.760
Pehle Brahman ho jaao, pehle Brahm ko jaano - bada one sided mamla hai [UNCLEAR - SAAB?], hai na?

01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:18.220
- [INAUDIBLE] Ma samajh ke maine shuru kiya 
- Theek hai bete, bas Ma samajh ke hi ho jayega - thoda sa imbalance aa gaya na.

01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:24.380
Samajh lena chahiye, kuch to dosh aa hi gaya hai. Uss dosh ko theek nahi karne ka kya - apne ko kya karne ka hai?

01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:31.400
Bhai Gayatri bhi to hamare liye hai na? Sab cheez hamare liye hai, agar humme usse labh hota hai to lena hai, nahi hota to nahi.

01:50:33.220 --> 01:50:38.700
Hmm, better now - relaxed? Hmm

01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:45.020
[LAUGHTER]

01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:51.300
Now how are you? Better, you see!

01:50:52.000 --> 01:51:00.300
- Sort of it 
- Yes, you are better. How are you? Is there a light on her Sacrum?

01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:07.100
Are you better now? Just see, stand up -

01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:14.100
All right!

01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:20.280
Aap bhi aayiye - Diabetes hai aapko?

01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:25.740
Yahan aayiye - ab put both the hands towards Me.

01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:33.960
- Aap kyaa karte hain - you know Hindi? 
- Tamil 
- Annh, Tamil - all right, sit down.

01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:39.680
You don't know Hindi at all? All right, sit down. So what do you do, what work do you do?

01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:42.860
- Now, I'm a housewife, now. 
- Only housewife?

01:51:43.060 --> 01:51:46.000
- [INAUDIBLE] teacher 
- Annh, that's why 
- Teacher

01:51:46.240 --> 01:51:53.360
Only a teacher can get diabetes not a housewife. [LAUGHTER] because you think too much.

01:51:54.040 --> 01:52:01.760
You think too much, isn't it? Think too much, all right. Now put your right hand towards Me and left hand like this.

01:52:02.880 --> 01:52:09.480
Sindur nahi lagate hain - aao, kumkum lagao. Haan now, you're all right? Fine - ab theek ho tum?

01:52:09.680 --> 01:52:12.600
Aao tumhara bhi screw zara dheela ho gaya usse

01:52:13.900 --> 01:52:20.460
- Ma aapke saamne [UNCLEAR] 
- Bete ab uspe zyada soch vichar nahi karo, soch vichar se aur badh jaata hai yeh problem.

01:52:20.700 --> 01:52:25.960
Tumhara aur right sided hai. Tum ab aake yahan seekho dhyan kaise karne ka - apne ko shaant kar lo pehle.

01:52:27.520 --> 01:52:35.520
Baat ye Hindustani log padhte zaroorat se zyada hain aur asliyat pe nahi utarte. Yeh log badi jaldi utar jaate hain. Tum log jaante zyada ho maante kam.

01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:39.280
- Ma kuch anubhav nahi hota na 
- Abhi dekho, haath mein aa raha hai thanda?

01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:43.680
Ab aa raha hai na, ab to anubhav aa raha hai. Anubhav nahi bhi ho to bhi padhne ki ek hadh hoti hai.

01:52:43.920 --> 01:52:50.600
Kabirdasji ne kaha hai, "Padhi, padhi pandit moorakh bhaye." Hamare Marathi mein kehte hain 'Padhat moorkh'

01:52:53.080 --> 01:52:57.580
You see, we Indians know a lot - have no experience.

01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:02.740
So first of all we have to neutralize all that is known.

01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:10.680
Surdasji, Surdas who was a great poet, he wrote the whole of Sursagar - means the ocean of sur.

01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:16.000
And there afterwards he says, "O Lord, take away my avidya ," - nonknowledge.

01:53:16.420 --> 01:53:22.780
"Surdas ki sabhi avidya door karo Nandlal." - Haan, ab dekho, aaya kehte hi saath.

01:53:23.060 --> 01:53:29.920
Kabir ne diya - leo, haan dekho, hai na? Abhi aap. May God bless you!

01:53:31.020 --> 01:53:35.080
Theek hai.  Aap kisko, Raj Rajeswari ko maante hain?

01:53:35.820 --> 01:53:41.020
- Annh? 
- I don't understand Hindi. 
- Whom, whom do you uh.. Krishna, all right?

01:53:41.300 --> 01:53:46.020
- Now, put your hand 
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- Haan, just let her ask the question

01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:55.420
- Ask the question, 
- See your fingers 
- "Shri Mataji, are You the avtaar of Adishakti," - look at Her and say, "Shri Mataji, are You the avtaar of Adishakti?"

01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:58.780
- Radha Krishna, haan 
- Radha Krishna 
- ask.

01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:02.000
- Shri Mataji, yes 
- Getting the cool?

01:54:02.220 --> 01:54:06.960
- Yes, it's coming 
- Ask the question, "Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?"

01:54:07.160 --> 01:54:10.120
- Look at 
- Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:19.800
- Ask 
- Ask again 
- Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna, Shri Mataji, are You Shri Krishna?

01:54:20.060 --> 01:54:25.940
Ab pehchano - itne din jiski seva ki woh agar saamne  khada jo jaaye to bhi use pehchan nahi sakte

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:33.860
- Hindi, Hindi nahi 
- The One who is standing before, you must recognize

01:54:34.100 --> 01:54:38.920
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- Haan 
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- Now, are you all right?

01:54:39.120 --> 01:54:45.260
- I'm feeling very much better now 
- Hmm 
- But did you hear what She said? The One who is standing before you, you must recognize.

01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:50.900
Indians have a greater capacity because they know what it is - you must understand that.

01:54:51.400 --> 01:54:56.040
You see I - but they understand more than you do - that's surprising.

01:54:58.500 --> 01:55:03.380
Not in India - India is different, of course. We have a tradition,

01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:07.180
we have a tradition of seeking in India.

01:55:08.220 --> 01:55:15.220
It's written down from childhood - everything is worked out for your seeking - you have to get your Self-realization.

01:55:15.420 --> 01:55:19.200
- South Africa 
- We have 
- South, South Africa 
- South Africa

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:24.560
Oh, to South Africa has lost all the vibrations,  or everything of Indian - uprooted

01:55:24.800 --> 01:55:31.640
- [INAUDIBLE] 
- Uh, so what, even in South Africa, if you are an Indian, you must carry your traditions there, you see.

01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:39.660
But it happens, like a mango tree if you bring it, bring it to England it will never prosper, it's like that - they get uprooted, I think.

01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:48.080
- Haan better, see, better? 
- Thank You. 
- Are you all right? Shakal badal gayi aapki.

01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:52.800
You're all right, now sleep like a log of wood. How is this gentleman? Put your hand

01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:59.700
- Better, not shaking so much 
- Not 
- Not 
- not so much but

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:04.740
- Yes, just put your 
- sometimes it comes and goes 
- Yes, that's the spirit

01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:11.960
[LAUGHTER][ Send it back to that Victoria [LAUGHTER] Institute.

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:19.680
Now, on the left Swadhishthana, work it on the left.

01:56:21.260 --> 01:56:25.780
All right, so now, I'll take your leave. May God bless you all!

01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:29.980
Please come, you have got a beautiful center here, we have got a beautiful school

01:56:30.200 --> 01:56:37.600
though it's only meant for 20 children, we already have got 20 children - so we can't admit your children here, agreed, but we can start another school

01:56:37.820 --> 01:56:43.820
if you all people help us we can start another place, you can have an ashram nearby your place, somewhere you're living

01:56:44.020 --> 01:56:48.860
we can manage all that but it's to be done by you and is to be arranged and organized.

01:56:49.060 --> 01:56:55.240
You, whatever it is now here, all of them live, they earn, they have this ashram, they run the ashram -

01:56:55.540 --> 01:57:01.200
I don't know what they do with their money - I've nothing to do with it. They know all the accounts, they know among themselves, they live well,

01:57:01.580 --> 01:57:07.300
they live happily, they help each other, they help others. In the same way you all are new people, you can come here

01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:12.800
and then we are going to start ashrams all over Melbourne as we have got in Sydney five ashrams

01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:17.920
and they're doing very well. So, we have to have some places but in the beginning you will have to come here, establish yourself

01:57:18.140 --> 01:57:22.420
and if you say you want to establish some ashram they will look into it and they'll manage. But

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:27.400
those who have been in sahaja yoga for so many days they know about it - don't try to challenge them,

01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:33.440
don't try to be aggressive, try to listen to them. Understand that I know them and through them I'll know you.

01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:38.140
So, please don't try to be aggressive. There is nothing like uh..

01:57:39.060 --> 01:57:45.880
what you call a one sided life in sahaja yoga. So nobody is going uh.. to be

01:57:46.120 --> 01:57:51.240
one sided for you or partial to you or nothing. If they say this is wrong with you please believe them

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:56.120
and just do what they're telling you because they know what is to be done in what case, how to

01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:01.580
uh.. refrain from, how to indulge, how to work it out -

01:58:01.800 --> 01:58:05.980
they know, they have gone through it now, they have been here for four years so they know about it.

01:58:06.220 --> 01:58:13.060
But that doesn't mean in any way you're less, you're in no way less - some of them have just come about a month back, I find them very good

01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:19.720
So, it is for you to learn, to have that humility, to learn more and more and know about it

01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:25.260
not mentally but through your experiences, different experiences how it works out.

01:58:25.480 --> 01:58:28.960
- Now 
- Mother, on Friday you asked us to bring sugar and salt

01:58:29.100 --> 01:58:33.480
- Yes, that I'm going to say - yes, that's a good idea. So now for that sugar and salt

01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:40.200
we'll be sending you some sugar and salt which is vibrated and you, they'll put it in that. Now don't use your hands

01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:48.140
you use a spoon to stir it and use that - it is vibrated. But those people who have active life should take to sugar more

01:58:48.460 --> 01:58:55.460
and those who have, say this lady has  Diabetes or anything - for her sugar is not good but salt -

01:58:55.760 --> 01:59:01.100
so she has to take salt. So that is how it is. So, I'll come inside and vibrate it and then you can bring it here.

01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:08.440
All right! So abhi theek hain aap? Kaise lag raha, dard kam hai? Are you better madam, are you feeling better now?

01:59:16.020 --> 01:59:19.180
Good, all right, so done!

01:59:21.300 --> 01:59:24.860
Don't get all the sick people.

01:59:26.400 --> 01:59:33.320
[CLAPPING]

01:59:33.600 --> 01:59:41.520
- [CLAPPING] 
- [INAUDIBLE]

01:59:47.080 --> 01:59:53.580
Good-bye, good-bye. I'll be back again and you all can come to India also

02:00:14.300 --> 02:00:18.560
No, no you do it, you just see that and they will tell you what is to happen

02:00:18.880 --> 02:00:23.960
-  Get somebody to explain to her [UNCLEAR] left hand 
- and also tell her husband not to bother her.

02:00:25.300 --> 02:00:28.280
- Tell 
- Thank you!

02:00:28.620 --> 02:00:32.280
Thank you, thank you all!

02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:35.680
Excuse me, if you all could sit down for a minute

02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:51.780
Come everyone and try, at the center here every Tuesday, Thursday nights at 7o'clock

02:00:51.980 --> 02:00:56.440
On Sundays at 2P.M. we have an evening here, meditation evening

02:00:56.840 --> 02:01:02.680
where the committed sahaja yogies [UNCLEAR] about sahaja yoga, you start establishing yourself.

02:01:02.920 --> 02:01:08.700
That's really important to come along. We've had very good response over this last three days

02:01:08.900 --> 02:01:15.000
with people. There must be over thousand people come to the programs. That's really [UNCLEAR] people come to-night

02:01:15.220 --> 02:01:20.940
That's really important that you all come and on this Tuesday normally have a special workshop evening

02:01:21.340 --> 02:01:27.780
[UNCLEAR] can ask you questions, we'll be talking about one of the chakras, first chakra Mooladhara chakra

02:01:28.760 --> 02:01:34.700
So, thanks for all coming. We have a cup of tea while at the back if you wish to stay.

02:01:35.220 --> 02:01:41.080
[UNCLEAR] May I suggest that when you are here in

02:01:41.380 --> 02:01:49.120
Victoria, to all the sahaja yogies who are here, that when you discuss the base chakra, you also explain in general the practices

02:01:49.380 --> 02:01:53.780
of sahaja yoga. We don't limit ourselves just to the one chakra each week.

02:01:54.080 --> 02:02:00.400
We learn more about the chakra but in general we'll explain to you the sorts of things that were happening here -

02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:05.520
how to clear out the chakras, how to work it out so that you can get on with it but a concentration

02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:11.640
will be made on one particular aspect each week. But you learn all about the various methods of balancing,

02:02:11.880 --> 02:02:18.080
clearing out the blockages, removing possessions that have crept in over our life time, love,

02:02:18.360 --> 02:02:24.120
diminishing the ego whatever it is. That can be worked out in a very practical way and that's what they want to show you.

02:02:24.920 --> 02:02:30.520
Center will be every Tuesday and Thursday night at  70'clock and 2 P.M. on Sundays

02:02:30.760 --> 02:02:35.120
At the back we have some [UNCLEAR] which is a photograph of Shri Mataji

02:02:35.360 --> 02:02:44.220
It will explain how to meditate at home, how to clear yourself out at bedtime and also has a program [UNCLEAR]

02:02:45.900 --> 02:02:52.580
Could the, the sahaja yoginies please just partly [UNCLEAR] inside quickly please.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:56.480
Just the ladies, just move inside quickly.
