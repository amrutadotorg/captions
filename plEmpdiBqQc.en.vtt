00:00:07.251 --> 00:00:11.977
Yogi: (in Marathi): Where is the Hamsa Chakra?

00:00:17.156 --> 00:00:21.659
Shri Mataji: Hamsa. This is the Hamsa chakra.

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:26.808
It’s a very, very material thing, I think, 
this chakra, is very material.

00:00:26.888 --> 00:00:30.707
And it has to be worked on material level only.

00:00:30.787 --> 00:00:37.599
It’s the centre here where most of the left and right sides,

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:41.654
in a way, cross on a material level here, 
‘material level’ again I say.

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:44.781
On a material level they cross over here.

00:00:46.222 --> 00:00:53.006
And when it gets spoilt, you get troubles like sinus

00:00:53.086 --> 00:00:58.503
and troubles like colds and coughs and all that.

00:00:58.583 --> 00:01:03.626
So, I myself have tried to get this into trouble 
and to find out

00:01:03.706 --> 00:01:07.296
what I should do, because if I live as I am,

00:01:07.376 --> 00:01:12.823
I will never be able to help you. So, I said, 
“I better get sick myself to see what happens.”

00:01:12.904 --> 00:01:16.404
And actually, what happens with this centre catching,

00:01:16.485 --> 00:01:23.746
the same thing, the drying up of the nose, of 
the humidity because of central heating is there.

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:28.205
For Indians, and Maharashtrians especially 
take a kadak bath,

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:30.325
means a very hot water.

00:01:30.405 --> 00:01:33.722
They use tremendously hot water to take their bath.

00:01:33.802 --> 00:01:37.216
For them it is very relaxing, 
which is an absolutely a wrong idea.

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:44.089
Normally a cold bath is the best. 
If not possible, take a tepid,

00:01:44.169 --> 00:01:50.722
can take little hot and then tepid, absolutely tepid water.

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:55.696
That will solve one of the problems that you do 
not expose yourself to too much cold or heat

00:01:55.776 --> 00:01:58.946
[and] the temperature is kept the same 
as the room temperature.

00:01:59.026 --> 00:02:02.096
Because you take a very hot bath and then you come out.

00:02:02.176 --> 00:02:06.510
In London people have died, Indians have died out 
of their lung cancer because

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:12.680
they can’t get out of their habit, bad habit, 
of taking bath in the morning.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.896
I call it bad habit for Indians, not for English, eh?

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.015
Because they’ll take their bath and immediately go to work.

00:02:24.095 --> 00:02:28.706
And so many Indians I have seen they have got 
lung cancer and they died there.

00:02:28.792 --> 00:02:32.221
And if you ask them, “Why?” “We don’t feel all right.”

00:02:32.301 --> 00:02:36.340
Then take your bath at four o‘clock in the morning,

00:02:36.421 --> 00:02:40.302
stay in the house, get used to the climate and then go.

00:02:40.382 --> 00:02:43.999
Or take your bath in the night.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:53.954
All extreme behaviours, from left to right, 
create the problems of Hamsa.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.125
Now what do you do?

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:14.246
Actually, is to neglect certain laws of nature.

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:20.803
Like in London or anywhere it’s all heated up
inside the rooms,

00:03:20.883 --> 00:03:23.727
too much heated up, and it’s very dry.

00:03:23.807 --> 00:03:28.533
And we all know that in England that 
you have to have a humidifier, isn’t it?

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:35.005
You must keep some water or something 
or fill a tub in the bath,

00:03:35.085 --> 00:03:39.272
and keep it open so that there is humidity in the room.

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:50.936
To compensate for all that [what] one can do 
is to take some water and sip in the nose.

00:03:51.029 --> 00:03:56.099
I would say, after brushing your teeth, 
sip it thrice and thrice you take it out.

00:03:56.185 --> 00:04:02.814
By putting these fingers, these thumbs 
in your ears and take it out.

00:04:02.894 --> 00:04:09.530
By that you’ll clear out your sinuses, 
you will make it humid.

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:15.298
Or for these parched mucus membranes, you can put some oil,

00:04:15.384 --> 00:04:19.673
or some ghee, is very good.

00:04:19.753 --> 00:04:25.026
If this water can have little salt, little salt, 
is a good idea.

00:04:25.106 --> 00:04:29.726
But that should not be very cold, should not be 
very hot, should be tepid.
