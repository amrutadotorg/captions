00:00:00.027 --> 00:00:00.843
1998-1214 Public Program, The Revival of Indian Spirituality

00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.939
Now you are coming from different countries.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.039
I am very happy to see you all.

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:10.347
Here also we have sahaja yogis from different countries who have come.

00:00:10.687 --> 00:00:15.007
Lucky that, that this time they are here and you are here.

00:00:17.568 --> 00:00:19.919
Many people come to India,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.729
all the time, from all over the world.

00:00:24.205 --> 00:00:27.992
And if you ask them they’d say we are seeking the truth.

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:31.793
So why are you coming to India of all the places?

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.641
They say that they have learned that the truth is in India,

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:41.182
that we have to find out the truth.

00:00:41.303 --> 00:00:45.583
I must say that in our country also we have lots of falsehood

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:48.710
and lots of false gurus have come up

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.767
just to make money, to befool people

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:56.400
and to some another to destroy our relationships.

00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:03.250
 But I must tell you that India is a very deep country

00:01:03.444 --> 00:01:08.294
and the knowledge of this country is not easy

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:12.405
for a western mind to grab.  Really to begin with

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.896
because the reason is,

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:19.997
the style of seeking knowledge in India is different,

00:01:20.178 --> 00:01:24.040
absolutely opposite of what you have in the West.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.308
First of all, in India,

00:01:27.746 --> 00:01:32.056
I mean those who are real seekers and those who want to know the reality

00:01:33.176 --> 00:01:40.269
they are the ones who see one point that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:45.019
this is  relation written in our ancient books,

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.558
described by great saints as you have also Sufis

00:01:50.583 --> 00:01:54.656
and all these people there and also prophets

00:01:54.681 --> 00:01:59.335
in the same way they believe that what they have written is the truth

00:01:59.382 --> 00:02:01.123
But

00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:12.756
But they, Indians, don’t challenge it.

00:02:13.213 --> 00:02:16.741
They don’t use rationality to find out

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:21.384
as in the West that [UNCLEAR and] think everything they start rationalizing.

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:24.214
They don’t rationalize.

00:02:24.248 --> 00:02:26.249
What they do, they believe

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.270
because it is told by the saints who are,

00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:30.908
who are above us.

00:02:30.922 --> 00:02:35.118
Who have reached a state which is much higher than (us).

00:02:35.142 --> 00:02:38.362
So now how to tally it, is the problem?

00:02:38.396 --> 00:02:42.964
So to tally it it is said that you have to get your self-realization

00:02:43.124 --> 00:02:47.180
or the second birth, as Mohammad sahib has talked about it

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.957
that you have to have kiyama means you have to have your second birth.

00:02:50.981 --> 00:02:55.229
If you don’t have your second birth you are not yet a complete person.

00:02:55.403 --> 00:02:57.719
Once you have your second birth

00:02:57.721 --> 00:03:03.600
then you must become also a complete spiritual personality.

00:03:03.927 --> 00:03:06.561
Unless and until you are a complete personality

00:03:06.586 --> 00:03:11.205
you cannot judge these people or have experiments within.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.992
So when you reach that state of,

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:18.260
I must say, the highest evolution within you

00:03:18.281 --> 00:03:22.464
then you can test it what they have said is the truth or not.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.634
But not at this human level.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.015
Because at this human level we are at the most what we are, mental.

00:03:29.235 --> 00:03:31.838
We are physical, emotional or mental.

00:03:31.863 --> 00:03:33.758
But we are not yet spiritual.

00:03:33.772 --> 00:03:38.199
Unless and until you are spiritual you cannot judge

00:03:38.345 --> 00:03:41.420
whether something is spiritual or not.

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:46.150
All this kind of understanding,

00:03:46.163 --> 00:03:51.323
all this kind of basically built-with-in-us

00:03:51.596 --> 00:03:54.002
for thousands of years you see.

00:03:54.027 --> 00:03:57.381
Indians are not the people who can be

00:03:57.406 --> 00:04:03.215
taken to rationality which they think is very low type of judgment.

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.775
They have to be in the spiritual realm,

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:15.644
in the spiritual personality, to understand spirituality.

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:19.339
Now from all over the world the spirituality is coming as you see

00:04:23.055 --> 00:04:29.175
but reality you can only find in India, I must say very humbly.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.605
The reason is, it has been a country for spirituality.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.483
Not for materialism.

00:04:38.046 --> 00:04:41.097
So the materialism has not grown so much.

00:04:41.122 --> 00:04:44.368
All other things have grown in this country.

00:04:44.393 --> 00:04:49.635
But for spirituality which it should have been.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.575
So people start thinking they are very superficial.  They are.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.486
The modern generation is very superficial

00:04:56.511 --> 00:04:59.403
and they take to all western ideas,

00:04:59.428 --> 00:05:03.195
western things and western culture.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.455
But our culture is very, very much in the foundation of human beings, foundation.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:17.395
Like as you see now things are happening in the west.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.655
We start wondering how these things have happened.

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.033
Is not allowed in any religion,

00:05:23.058 --> 00:05:27.875
is not allowed in any books or anything.

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.355
Why people are behaving like this?

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.516
The reason is they have no faith, actual faith.

00:05:34.541 --> 00:05:36.801
What they do is to just show off or to make a group.

00:05:36.826 --> 00:05:41.820
They make a what you can call, a group to say

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:45.704
that we belong to this religion, that religion, that religion.

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:53.290
But if you see the Indian philosophy you will find all the religions are exalted.

00:05:53.315 --> 00:06:01.938
All this, you can say, all the principles of this great religions are there.

00:06:01.963 --> 00:06:08.503
You cannot challenge it because it is so basically true.

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:13.435
So basically true that when you see what is written say in Kuran

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.006
we have a book here.  I don’t know if

00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:19.575
I gave you that one.  We have a very nice book Light of Kuran.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.975
So when they read kuran also they do not read it.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.938
When they read bible also they don’t read it.

00:06:25.963 --> 00:06:30.743
Because they are lost in the words and same things happening to Indians.

00:06:30.768 --> 00:06:35.560
Their, all their philosophies and all that they get lost into the words you see.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:39.415
So in the web of words everything is lost.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.135
As a result they do not reach to the principle that is described.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.084
That’s why we have problems with every other religion

00:06:48.109 --> 00:06:50.931
but there should be no problem, no problem.

00:06:50.956 --> 00:06:54.751
Because all religions are based on the same principle

00:06:54.776 --> 00:06:58.635
that we have to achieve our spiritual ascent.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:02.796
There’s no other goal.  But according to time, you see, they had to put things

00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:05.715
this should not be done, that should not be done.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.662
All this is due to the time factor which came in their time

00:07:11.687 --> 00:07:16.051
and they had to tell about it according to the society in which they lived,

00:07:16.076 --> 00:07:21.743
according to the behavior of the people of that time.

00:07:22.268 --> 00:07:26.865
In India because it’s an ancient country, very ancient,

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:30.898
somebody told me, Mother why don’t you write a book on Indian culture?

00:07:30.923 --> 00:07:35.409
No, I said, it’s an ocean.  It’s not easy to describe and ocean.

00:07:35.434 --> 00:07:38.443
It’s an ocean and is very deep.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.616
But when imbibed and when understood

00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:46.621
and when you become spiritual within

00:07:46.646 --> 00:07:50.007
then it just sieves into you,

00:07:50.173 --> 00:07:54.193
just comes into you and it shows that

00:07:54.217 --> 00:07:58.454
every culture of every country is the same.

00:07:58.479 --> 00:08:04.217
But in Indian culture it’s very very clearly described.

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.770
That’s the only thing is the same thing is described.

00:08:07.795 --> 00:08:15.175
I mean now say there’s, ah, say Clinton is now in trouble.

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.923
In India he would have been thrown out long time back.

00:08:19.277 --> 00:08:25.980
You see, because the value system of morality is very well described in Indian culture.

00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.652
This is not moral and this is moral.

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:34.774
And the ruler has to be absolutely a moral person.

00:08:34.799 --> 00:08:37.850
But in America, you see, is different.

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:42.886
There as I said is perversion has come into the brains of people.

00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:47.720
And because they have money materialistic people try to follow American life,

00:08:48.273 --> 00:08:51.986
which is not congenial.  If you go to America

00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:55.835
you will find it’s not congenial to human beings.  It’s very destructive.

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:59.195
People are very destructive.  They have no love.

00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:02.069
They try to dominate.  They have racialism.

00:09:02.094 --> 00:09:04.455
I mean they have all kinds of things.

00:09:04.673 --> 00:09:09.060
While we too have in our country lots of bad things have come

00:09:09.085 --> 00:09:11.806
because of the British rule which came here.

00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:16.022
Most of our bureaucrats are nothing but British.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.915
They dress up like British, their behavior is like British.

00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.271
I don’t say something wrong with the British also.

00:09:24.296 --> 00:09:29.069
But one thing is there, this country has evolved for so many years

00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:31.689
and they tried to dominate us so much

00:09:31.714 --> 00:09:37.695
that none of our, I should say, literature could come up.

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.454
So much has gone into darkness.

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.688
The other day I had an ambassador here from Mexico,

00:09:46.713 --> 00:09:50.255
and he told Me, what is the problem of Mexico?

00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:55.763
I said, it's the problem of Zakat, psychological.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.170
He said, what do you mean?

00:09:57.195 --> 00:10:00.643
I said, in Sanskrit language we call it Bhuta Bada,

00:10:00.836 --> 00:10:04.443
means the obstruction from the past.

00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:11.484
Now they don't believe in a sort of a dead body

00:10:11.509 --> 00:10:14.360
or a dead person can invade human beings.

00:10:14.385 --> 00:10:18.882
They don't believe, though Christ removed the,

00:10:18.907 --> 00:10:22.097
what you call, the devils from the people like that,

00:10:22.104 --> 00:10:23.335
but they don't believe.

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.775
Even in kuran there's a mention like that,

00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.716
but that is all right in Quran, that is all right in Bible,

00:10:29.741 --> 00:10:33.388
but as far as the belief in the human beings there is,

00:10:33.413 --> 00:10:34.975
they don't believe.

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.742
Now if I tell them that the psychosomatic troubles come

00:10:39.767 --> 00:10:46.843
from the left side attack, left side attack, that is from the past,

00:10:46.926 --> 00:10:52.485
from the things that have gone out of circulation from evolution,

00:10:52.510 --> 00:10:58.357
or you can say dead body, dead person, dead personality,

00:10:58.382 --> 00:11:01.083
they'll just refuse it to listen to it.

00:11:01.108 --> 00:11:03.571
But if, unless and until you believe in it

00:11:03.596 --> 00:11:05.316
and you experiment with it,

00:11:05.341 --> 00:11:08.296
how will you be able to eradicate this bad thing?

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:12.144
So that is not only there, every country has this problem,

00:11:12.169 --> 00:11:15.636
every country, even England is full of it.

00:11:15.661 --> 00:11:19.767
I mean advanced country like America is much worse.

00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:22.576
To add up to that lots of false gurus went to America

00:11:22.601 --> 00:11:24.515
and have done this one.

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:29.158
So on this point also people don't want to agree,

00:11:29.183 --> 00:11:31.385
but whether you agree or not,

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.730
tomorrow you'll have to come to it,

00:11:33.755 --> 00:11:37.730
because if you want to get cured of your psychosomatic trouble,

00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:39.856
even cancer, even AIDS,

00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.461
all these diseases come only by the attack

00:11:43.486 --> 00:11:46.175
of these small small particles

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:49.366
of these viruses which were left

00:11:49.606 --> 00:11:54.015
out of our circulation through evolution.

00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:58.755
That will be seen, that is the knowledge to be seen very clearly.

00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:03.683
Now in Sahaja Yoga many people have been cured of cancer, no doubt,

00:12:03.708 --> 00:12:06.235
also of AIDS they have cured.

00:12:06.473 --> 00:12:08.213
So many people have been cured, it's not,

00:12:08.238 --> 00:12:10.906
I'm not telling you something false,

00:12:10.931 --> 00:12:14.606
but for that one has to understand that

00:12:14.971 --> 00:12:18.637
there is some power beyond us, something much beyond,

00:12:18.662 --> 00:12:21.656
like Einstein himself has said that

00:12:21.681 --> 00:12:26.945
there is a kind of area which he calls as torsion area,

00:12:26.970 --> 00:12:29.985
which you will see in one of these things,

00:12:30.010 --> 00:12:37.778
torsion area, which is beyond our human personality,

00:12:37.803 --> 00:12:43.805
he calls it, we have to be a vacuum ourselves,

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:49.275
we should not exist anymore as physical, emotional or a mental being.

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.151
When you go beyond that, if there's a vacuum,

00:12:52.176 --> 00:12:55.905
then only you can feel the torsion area, he's clearly said it,

00:12:55.930 --> 00:12:58.663
but he was a realized soul himself,

00:12:58.688 --> 00:13:02.818
so whatever he says people want to doubt, you see, whether it is,

00:13:02.843 --> 00:13:05.508
so with rationality we start doubting,

00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:10.345
but not to believe in Einstein shows how arrogant we are,

00:13:10.370 --> 00:13:13.736
after all Einstein is saying there must be some in it,

00:13:13.761 --> 00:13:19.555
like that the whole world is going on, on a very superficial basis.

00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:23.858
Now our Sahaja Yoga is a very different thing,

00:13:23.883 --> 00:13:29.211
it is that we all human beings

00:13:29.236 --> 00:13:34.504
have a special power, a residual power within us called Kundalini,

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:37.629
which resides in the triangular bone,

00:13:39.403 --> 00:13:42.063
which is called as sacrum.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:45.869
Now the sacrum bone means it's a sacred bone,

00:13:46.416 --> 00:13:49.924
that means Greeks knew about it, that's a sacred bone,

00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:59.103
and this power when it rises from here goes through the,

00:13:59.275 --> 00:14:03.264
we call it as Sushumna Nadi, the central path of a gent,

00:14:03.289 --> 00:14:07.312
and pierces through the fontanel bone area,

00:14:07.337 --> 00:14:10.436
then you get the actualization of baptism,

00:14:10.809 --> 00:14:14.538
then you become a Muslim, then you become a Hindu,

00:14:14.563 --> 00:14:16.383
otherwise you are not,

00:14:16.433 --> 00:14:20.412
so it has to come out of your fontanel bone area

00:14:20.556 --> 00:14:25.849
and has to go through that torsion area.

00:14:43.316 --> 00:14:45.635
Can you all see this one?

00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:48.390
We should raise it a little more.

00:14:52.630 --> 00:14:57.685
Now it is said in our books that such and such power exists

00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:02.670
and it has to rise, it exists in every human being,

00:15:02.695 --> 00:15:07.923
whether he is Indian or Egyptian,

00:15:08.123 --> 00:15:11.156
black or white, anything,

00:15:11.181 --> 00:15:17.489
as long as he's a human being he has this in the triangular bone down.

00:15:18.343 --> 00:15:24.409
So it rises through these six centers, the seventh center is down,

00:15:24.823 --> 00:15:31.271
and when it rises to six centers it pierces through the fontanel bone area,

00:15:31.296 --> 00:15:36.946
which we call as thousand petaled center,

00:15:38.086 --> 00:15:41.560
and becomes one with the subtler energy which is surrounding us,

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:45.589
which does all living work.

00:15:45.623 --> 00:15:47.963
Now you see the beautiful flowers,

00:15:47.988 --> 00:15:50.995
these flowers are made by whom?

00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:54.335
You'll say the Mother Earth, but how is it Mother Earth does that,

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:58.040
from where does she get the power, how do you run your heart?

00:15:58.065 --> 00:15:59.726
Ask a simple question,

00:15:59.860 --> 00:16:04.089
it is you run your heart because of the same power

00:16:04.114 --> 00:16:08.656
that is all-pervading divine power of love,

00:16:08.886 --> 00:16:12.063
it's a power of compassion and love.

00:16:13.233 --> 00:16:16.829
One should understand the basic, it's not hatred,

00:16:17.213 --> 00:16:20.775
it's not violence, it is love, it's compassion,

00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:24.436
and this power works out in everything.

00:16:25.193 --> 00:16:28.529
It works out in such a manner

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:33.357
that once you get that you can feel it on your fingers all these centers,

00:16:33.382 --> 00:16:35.997
you can see clearly there are shown

00:16:36.022 --> 00:16:38.577
that on the fingertips you can feel

00:16:38.602 --> 00:16:43.143
what is the center that is catching, you can feel your own.

00:16:43.168 --> 00:16:49.148
Mohammad Sahab has said it very clearly,

00:16:49.173 --> 00:16:52.850
your hands will speak at the time of kıyama,

00:16:53.183 --> 00:16:55.360
at the time of last judgment, we can

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.403
call it or the last resurrection,

00:16:58.030 --> 00:17:02.650
your, your hands will speak,

00:17:03.550 --> 00:17:07.329
your hands will speak, that means they will show,

00:17:07.354 --> 00:17:10.636
your hands will show what center you are catching.

00:17:11.050 --> 00:17:14.530
Can you imagine when he said that nobody tries to analyze

00:17:14.537 --> 00:17:16.258
how can our hands speak

00:17:16.283 --> 00:17:20.196
but your hands will speak, he has clearly said it

00:17:20.256 --> 00:17:22.545
and that is what happens to you

00:17:22.570 --> 00:17:26.516
that you see your fingers showing you

00:17:26.541 --> 00:17:30.656
whether you are catching this center or this center or this.

00:17:31.556 --> 00:17:35.480
This is actualization, this is not just talking,

00:17:35.505 --> 00:17:39.176
it's not only just describing something

00:17:39.201 --> 00:17:43.143
but it happens to everyone and should happen.

00:17:43.816 --> 00:17:46.043
As a result what happens,

00:17:46.068 --> 00:17:50.516
all these centers are responsible for our

00:17:51.417 --> 00:17:55.743
physical, mental, emotional and spiritual being,

00:17:56.103 --> 00:17:58.510
so they all get enlightened,

00:17:58.541 --> 00:18:02.736
they get integrated, also they are nourished,

00:18:02.761 --> 00:18:07.303
so all our physical, mental, emotional problems get solved

00:18:07.328 --> 00:18:09.669
and we become spiritual.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:14.326
Now whatever country you may belong to,

00:18:14.767 --> 00:18:17.366
whatever religion you may belong to,

00:18:17.391 --> 00:18:21.210
you have every right to become spiritual

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:25.003
and when you become that you'll be amazed to see

00:18:25.028 --> 00:18:29.183
that so many qualities within us start showing.

00:18:29.330 --> 00:18:33.118
The first and foremost quality that comes to you

00:18:33.143 --> 00:18:38.176
is you get a new dimension in your awareness

00:18:38.736 --> 00:18:42.283
and what is that is collective consciousness.

00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:46.310
You become collectively conscious,

00:18:46.335 --> 00:18:48.496
means you can feel another person.

00:18:48.521 --> 00:18:51.496
You know what's the problem with that? With love,

00:18:52.803 --> 00:18:55.538
not with anger but with love

00:18:55.563 --> 00:18:57.978
you feel one with another person.

00:18:58.003 --> 00:19:02.330
Once it happens all quarrels, some things will disappear.

00:19:02.537 --> 00:19:05.831
The whole world can be changed and transformed

00:19:05.856 --> 00:19:13.124
and you as people who are responsible for the media

00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:18.378
can do a lot but for people it's very difficult because they have got

00:19:18.403 --> 00:19:21.804
on top of them other bosses sitting, this, that

00:19:21.829 --> 00:19:24.444
and if they write anything like that maybe

00:19:24.469 --> 00:19:28.942
that it may not be liked, it may not be appreciated

00:19:29.466 --> 00:19:33.311
but you have to have courage and you must write about the truth.

00:19:33.336 --> 00:19:35.755
If you find it, if you get it,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.563
you must write about it.

00:19:37.813 --> 00:19:39.903
As a result what happens?

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:48.082
Actually what happens is that we are made of subtler energy.

00:19:49.500 --> 00:19:52.389
When we talk that this Mother Earth,

00:19:52.414 --> 00:19:54.620
there are five elements which are made

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:58.527
but these elements are made of subtler energies.

00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:03.576
Once you become that your subtler energies start manifesting

00:20:04.003 --> 00:20:09.335
and with that subtler energy you start getting different types of things.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:14.354
For example, they say it is the word

00:20:14.379 --> 00:20:18.320
or we call it shabd and from there it is

00:20:18.345 --> 00:20:22.025
the another thing comes is naad, is a sound.

00:20:22.181 --> 00:20:24.335
This is the beginning I am talking about

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.100
and with that sound once you have

00:20:27.125 --> 00:20:30.583
the sound then from the sound

00:20:30.828 --> 00:20:34.357
all these five elements come one after another

00:20:34.382 --> 00:20:37.916
but the first one that comes out is light.

00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.549
So such a person starts showing light.

00:20:40.574 --> 00:20:44.190
You have seen there, see how the light is all over.

00:20:45.544 --> 00:20:46.843
That is the first thing.  Tejaswa

00:20:46.857 --> 00:20:50.130
What is Tejasva called? Tejaswa is called? Take it out(in Hindi language)

00:20:50.156 --> 00:20:50.770
Yogi: Radiance.

00:20:50.795 --> 00:20:52.083
Huh? Yogi: Radiance.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:55.263
Radiance of light, radiance of light,

00:20:55.543 --> 00:20:57.136
radiance of light.

00:20:57.148 --> 00:20:59.567
So that....

00:20:59.614 --> 00:21:05.483
that starts showing radiance of light around a person.

00:21:05.508 --> 00:21:08.851
As they have shown auras and all that you must have seen

00:21:08.876 --> 00:21:11.120
in so many people they show auras also.

00:21:11.145 --> 00:21:15.663
The artists have seen auras around realized souls.

00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:26.698
Then that from the same comes the second subtle thing is vayu.

00:21:26.722 --> 00:21:31.945
Vayu is air.

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:36.205
Vayu is air, cool breeze.

00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:40.223
So you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost as they say.

00:21:40.450 --> 00:21:42.164
This is the second thing.

00:21:42.189 --> 00:21:43.930
These are all subtle things.

00:21:43.955 --> 00:21:46.845
Of the air subtler is vayu.

00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:48.045
So it starts.

00:21:48.070 --> 00:21:52.898
So all subtler energy starts showing from a jala.

00:21:52.923 --> 00:21:55.056
Jala ka bhi subtler.

00:22:00.313 --> 00:22:07.532
So from water also you get a subtler thing of jala.

00:22:07.660 --> 00:22:10.575
Jala is we can call it moisture.

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:13.266
But moisture is not subtle.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.615
But a moisture person.

00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:19.360
What happens with the moisture that your body becomes softer.

00:22:19.385 --> 00:22:23.355
You know if you put moisturizing things your body becomes softer.

00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:26.880
Your face becomes subtler and the dryness doesn't come

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.199
and your youth is preserved.

00:22:30.224 --> 00:22:32.297
At least you look young.

00:22:32.322 --> 00:22:34.990
Your aging doesn't come.

00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:38.849
Like that everything starts showing.

00:22:38.874 --> 00:22:45.856
Then agni is what?

00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:48.545
Fire.

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:49.905
Then the fire.

00:22:49.930 --> 00:22:54.897
See such a person is fire

00:22:54.922 --> 00:22:58.797
but he doesn't use because of love does very much.

00:22:58.822 --> 00:23:01.423
But fire can be used for two purposes.

00:23:01.448 --> 00:23:03.901
One is for burning out something

00:23:03.926 --> 00:23:07.094
and one for cooking food and doing things.

00:23:07.119 --> 00:23:11.774
So such a person can create wonderful types

00:23:11.799 --> 00:23:15.370
of foods and interested in giving good food

00:23:15.395 --> 00:23:19.263
to people and that food has vibrations.

00:23:19.723 --> 00:23:24.184
The food of such a person has vibrations

00:23:24.209 --> 00:23:30.570
because it has cooked with that love and passion, compassion.

00:23:30.856 --> 00:23:37.296
So that you take that food and

00:23:37.397 --> 00:23:44.705
you become a, it can call a very tranquil person, satisfied.

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:47.543
You get with that very much satisfied.

00:23:47.690 --> 00:23:52.803
Now once you people become satisfied materialism will be finished.

00:23:52.922 --> 00:23:55.169
Materialism will have no sense because

00:23:55.194 --> 00:24:00.325
what is it today you buy something then you go and buy another thing.

00:24:00.350 --> 00:24:01.285
Isn't it?

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:07.177
It is all the time you are dissatisfied.

00:24:07.410 --> 00:24:09.010
Today you want to have a table then

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:10.490
tomorrow you want to have a sofa then

00:24:10.490 --> 00:24:13.845
you want to have a car, want to have endless.

00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:14.823
That finishes.

00:24:14.848 --> 00:24:16.856
You become very much satisfied.

00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:20.165
If you buy a table you'll enjoy it.

00:24:20.190 --> 00:24:22.250
You buy a sofa you'll enjoy it.

00:24:22.330 --> 00:24:24.416
You meet somebody you'll enjoy it.

00:24:24.510 --> 00:24:30.658
So this particular nature that human beings have

00:24:30.683 --> 00:24:33.763
is what you call the greed finishes.

00:24:34.530 --> 00:24:37.920
And he is a satisfied soul, he is a happy soul

00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:40.656
and he enjoys himself.

00:24:41.076 --> 00:24:44.062
This is happening with the Agni Tattvas.

00:24:44.302 --> 00:24:50.165
Because this fire becomes a very silent, beautiful,

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:55.136
satisfying fire in the subtle form when you get it.

00:24:55.610 --> 00:24:59.409
Then Jala Tattva hai is the water.

00:24:59.750 --> 00:25:02.623
Water which is being vibrated,

00:25:02.648 --> 00:25:06.290
which has got vibrations can cure you.

00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.415
But normally you take any water it's not going to cure you.

00:25:10.440 --> 00:25:12.436
But water which is being vibrated

00:25:12.461 --> 00:25:15.701
by some saint or something can cure you

00:25:15.726 --> 00:25:18.611
and also you must have heard of many places where

00:25:18.636 --> 00:25:22.316
they have waterfalls which waterfalls

00:25:22.341 --> 00:25:26.415
which what you can call are curative type.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.095
All this is the subtler side of these five elements.

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:32.636
Then the Mother Earth.

00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:38.983
Certain places are we call it as very sacred.

00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:40.857
For example Mecca.

00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:42.360
Now what is so special of Mecca?

00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.135
It's a stone there that's all.

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.893
What is so special?

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.793
The special according to our Puranas,

00:25:48.818 --> 00:25:52.786
our old literature it's Makeshwar Shiva itself.

00:25:53.726 --> 00:25:56.588
God has come in the form of that stone

00:25:56.613 --> 00:26:00.135
according to Indian descriptions.

00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.294
You can imagine

00:26:01.318 --> 00:26:04.656
we have many Shiva's out of them one is in Mecca.

00:26:04.681 --> 00:26:08.816
So but to prohibit Hindus to go there is wrong.

00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:13.890
Because they believe in Shiva and there is a Shiva there sitting down.

00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:20.923
Like that we have all the all the elements

00:26:21.103 --> 00:26:24.838
go into transformation and they become such

00:26:24.863 --> 00:26:27.623
and human beings also become such.

00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:31.161
So they understand that there is no difference

00:26:31.186 --> 00:26:36.295
between a person living in this country or that country or that country.

00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.793
So all your political problems can be solved.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:43.200
Supposing you give realization to Arafat

00:26:43.225 --> 00:26:49.770
and to this new president of Israel no problem.

00:26:52.186 --> 00:26:57.552
If Israelis and Palestinians are given realization no problem.

00:26:58.392 --> 00:27:01.165
They all can live very happily

00:27:01.793 --> 00:27:05.439
and there will be no problem because they'll see the oneness.

00:27:05.464 --> 00:27:09.475
The subtlety that comes is that you feel the collectiveness.

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:12.183
You feel one with everyone

00:27:14.976 --> 00:27:21.816
and this is the new we should say transformation we are waiting for.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:28.026
That way Sahaja Yoga is working very fast all over

00:27:28.326 --> 00:27:33.201
but it's not very advertising type I must admit

00:27:33.226 --> 00:27:36.080
because I don't like too much of advertisement myself.

00:27:37.660 --> 00:27:43.440
But it advertises by itself by itself

00:27:43.713 --> 00:27:50.526
and the truth about it is that people have experimented and experienced.

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.454
Now in a place far-fetched place like Leningrad in Russia

00:27:56.479 --> 00:28:01.058
when I went there I was surprised that

00:28:01.083 --> 00:28:03.931
we had put one or two photographs here

00:28:03.956 --> 00:28:08.330
and there I think may not be even in the newspaper

00:28:08.355 --> 00:28:12.083
and they were two thousand people who filled the hall.

00:28:12.108 --> 00:28:17.363
They have limited capacity you have to pay for the hall people.

00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:21.720
So outside there were two thousand sitting I said how is it?

00:28:21.745 --> 00:28:22.615
How do you?

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.595
You are all here for what?

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.255
They said Mother to listen to them.

00:28:26.280 --> 00:28:31.578
Then I went inside I said all right let me finish

00:28:31.603 --> 00:28:34.535
these people and let me finish my lecture.

00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.975
When I came out you'll be amazed they were still sitting.

00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:39.895
I said what is it?

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:42.433
He said Mother we are waiting for our self-realization.

00:28:42.580 --> 00:28:44.995
I said all right you come tomorrow all of you

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:46.701
and I'll give you self-realization.

00:28:46.726 --> 00:28:49.854
You won't believe all these two thousand inside

00:28:49.879 --> 00:28:51.765
out two thousand outside

00:28:51.790 --> 00:28:57.669
there's a very big this is one thing about Russia they have huge big compounds.

00:28:57.980 --> 00:29:01.256
So many came and also one thousand more perhaps.

00:29:01.281 --> 00:29:03.943
They all came and we all sat down.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:06.798
They sat on the grass and I sat on the steps

00:29:06.823 --> 00:29:09.936
and I talked to them and pin drop

00:29:09.961 --> 00:29:14.465
and all of them are still Sahaja Yogis growing very much.

00:29:14.490 --> 00:29:20.230
I was amazed at how these people are attracted.

00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.929
What has made them come?

00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:27.456
So they said Mother so obvious your face.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:31.614
My face I did not think it was that much.

00:29:31.639 --> 00:29:36.110
Yes we just saw your photograph finished we know.

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:39.445
Now what has happened with them is that with communism

00:29:39.470 --> 00:29:41.595
they are very much suppressed.

00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:43.760
They couldn't express themselves too much.

00:29:43.785 --> 00:29:45.337
They didn't have that freedom.

00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.995
So they sought their freedom inside.

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:49.655
They grew inside

00:29:49.679 --> 00:29:52.358
but when we have so-called freedom you go

00:29:52.383 --> 00:29:56.875
you see into abandonment  you do all kinds of things in the name of freedom.

00:29:56.885 --> 00:29:58.898
Human beings have too much freedom.

00:29:58.923 --> 00:30:03.115
When they are in the so-called democracy.

00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.355
So they can become even demons.

00:30:05.380 --> 00:30:08.795
You see in a democracy you can become also demonic.

00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:12.877
So that can happen, but in Russia I was surprised

00:30:12.902 --> 00:30:15.236
and so many we have now sahaja yogis.

00:30:15.261 --> 00:30:17.155
I mean I have, I don’t know countless.

00:30:17.180 --> 00:30:19.485
You cannot count them as such.

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:22.359
Surprising that  country has got so many.

00:30:22.384 --> 00:30:24.746
And they are very satisfied souls.

00:30:24.771 --> 00:30:27.131
Whatever has happened I told them aren’t you

00:30:27.156 --> 00:30:29.072
worried about your political problems.

00:30:29.097 --> 00:30:30.399
No Mother.

00:30:30.424 --> 00:30:31.458
Why?

00:30:31.483 --> 00:30:33.027
We are in the kingdom of God.

00:30:33.052 --> 00:30:35.517
Why should we worry?

00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:38.129
See this satisfaction.

00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:39.815
In the kingdom of God we are.

00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.671
See this kind of a mind of thousands of people.

00:30:44.090 --> 00:30:48.240
See this kind of a mind of thousands of people.

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:52.867
See it’s not just a false satisfaction.

00:30:52.874 --> 00:30:55.115
But factual I think…

00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:59.224
They are having lots of other things with them.

00:30:59.249 --> 00:31:02.989
For example, the vegetable growth has gone up.

00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:07.389
They have everything in that country.

00:31:07.414 --> 00:31:10.805
But the management is so bad that they are poor supposed to be.

00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:11.935
But they are not.

00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:15.837
Actually they have lots of things that many countries don’t have.

00:31:15.968 --> 00:31:19.586
But inside I was surprised that

00:31:19.739 --> 00:31:23.455
people in Russia are the most sensitive.

00:31:23.759 --> 00:31:27.517
May be they were so oppressed and so troubled.

00:31:27.753 --> 00:31:32.165
So this oppression has gone in the proper way

00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:37.662
there that they developed this kind of a sensitivity to spirituality.

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.691
In our country also we were very much suppressed

00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:48.420
but instead of getting into the same mode as the Russians have

00:31:48.613 --> 00:31:50.995
we have tried to become Britishers you know.

00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:51.980
We are very slavish.

00:31:52.700 --> 00:31:56.288
Because one women comes from there who is very fair from Italy

00:31:56.313 --> 00:31:58.113
and we are all surrendered to her.

00:31:59.490 --> 00:32:03.101
Such slavery of fair complexion

00:32:03.115 --> 00:32:04.965
I have never seen before.

00:32:04.990 --> 00:32:09.702
But it shows our basic slavish mentality.

00:32:09.823 --> 00:32:15.724
And that’s why we have closed all our old books our knowledge into seed.

00:32:15.749 --> 00:32:18.325
We are not bothered to see that.

00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:22.751
And we are incapable of going into it and finding out

00:32:22.937 --> 00:32:26.259
what is so great about our country.

00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:31.392
It’s so much encompassing the whole universe.

00:32:31.975 --> 00:32:36.662
And what we can give them the highest that is the spirituality

00:32:36.843 --> 00:32:38.185
which they don’t have.

00:32:38.210 --> 00:32:41.565
Now because they have gone into materialism fully.

00:32:41.590 --> 00:32:45.837
But all our books all our literature has gone into waste.

00:32:45.923 --> 00:32:49.770
Nobody wants to read about it, nobody wants to know about it.

00:32:50.036 --> 00:32:53.188
Now with sahaja yog there is a revival in a way

00:32:53.213 --> 00:32:56.949
because we have a hospital now, regular hospital,

00:32:57.110 --> 00:33:04.945
where people are treating all kinds of incurable diseases.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:14.282
But is so simple no medicine nothing, raising your kundalini, finished.

00:33:14.533 --> 00:33:18.681
You raise the kundalini and you get it.

00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.169
You don’t have to waste money on medicines

00:33:22.194 --> 00:33:23.575
because what is medicine today.

00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:26.094
When I was studying medicine,

00:33:26.119 --> 00:33:31.521
they had to learn each and every medicine

00:33:31.640 --> 00:33:33.542
and we had to write a proper

00:33:33.567 --> 00:33:37.385
what you call a complete serial number of all these

00:33:37.410 --> 00:33:40.032
and a compounder had to make it.

00:33:40.057 --> 00:33:45.395
But now you see this, all these companies are making what you call antibiotics.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.195
For everything happens to there’s an antibiotic.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.462
They are not bothered as to how it affects you

00:33:50.487 --> 00:33:52.968
what if it bothers you.

00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:55.036
And it has become like that now.

00:33:55.061 --> 00:33:58.695
We have become so industrialized you see, doctors…

00:33:58.720 --> 00:34:03.120
that it is difficult for people to get out of it.

00:34:03.145 --> 00:34:06.147
Sahaja yoga we don’t give any antibiotics.

00:34:06.172 --> 00:34:08.702
We don’t give any antibiotics.  Not at all.

00:34:08.727 --> 00:34:09.654
We don’t give any.

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:14.159
Only kundalini rising and vibrated water and all that.

00:34:17.019 --> 00:34:19.236
Diagnosis also is such a rigmarole.

00:34:19.261 --> 00:34:21.364
I mean if you go for diagnosis

00:34:21.389 --> 00:34:25.001
you come out half dead out of that diagnosis.

00:34:25.065 --> 00:34:29.275
Such a person… In sahaja yoga you can get it on the finger tips.

00:34:29.300 --> 00:34:32.616
Even children can tell you what’s wrong with you,

00:34:32.686 --> 00:34:34.694
if you are a realized soul.

00:34:34.719 --> 00:34:38.738
So such a great science is lost in this country

00:34:38.763 --> 00:34:42.618
because of a British rule we had.

00:34:42.727 --> 00:34:45.356
They never bothered to find out

00:34:45.381 --> 00:34:48.991
what was deep down into this country, such a knowledge,

00:34:49.016 --> 00:34:51.415
such a treasure of knowledge.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:55.300
So it happens also such that I met him

00:34:55.325 --> 00:35:01.853
in a very…. different circumstances

00:35:01.857 --> 00:35:03.557
and he was very helpful

00:35:03.582 --> 00:35:07.315
and he only told me. “How is he here?”, I said.

00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.765
He said, “We are, so many of us are here..

00:35:09.790 --> 00:35:14.130
and who are…who have come for this conference

00:35:14.155 --> 00:35:15.695
and..”  So I was very happy.

00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:17.487
And he said, “They would like to meet you Mother.”

00:35:17.512 --> 00:35:19.622
So I said,” Alright I would love to meet them

00:35:19.647 --> 00:35:21.722
and talk to them about it.”

00:35:21.747 --> 00:35:25.794
Now as you are all, what you can call, journalists

00:35:25.819 --> 00:35:28.915
used to questions, I would like you to ask me questions.

00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:31.833
Doesn’t matter.  I mean, sit here, Sit here.

00:35:46.216 --> 00:35:51.390
Man: Hi, I have already seen Mataji at Kathmandu.

00:35:51.422 --> 00:35:53.314
Because I am from Nepal.

00:35:53.335 --> 00:35:56.761
And I would like to ask Matajii

00:35:56.786 --> 00:36:01.859
how do you find the..about religion..

00:36:01.884 --> 00:36:04.644
how they treat upon religion.

00:36:04.664 --> 00:36:06.130
What’s your views?

00:36:06.137 --> 00:36:07.312
How do you treat upon..?

00:36:07.337 --> 00:36:09.777
Man: Yeah upon religion. Yeah

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:18.199
You see reasoning is done by your brain isn’t it..so called.

00:36:18.380 --> 00:36:21.560
But actually it’s not brain so much I should say

00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:25.499
but your conditioning and your ego.

00:36:25.706 --> 00:36:28.100
They give you the reasoning.

00:36:28.125 --> 00:36:30.870
This is the reason, this is the reason this is..

00:36:30.878 --> 00:36:32.764
but you reach nowhere.

00:36:34.168 --> 00:36:37.365
You reach nowhere.  You go on reasoning, reasoning, reasoning.

00:36:37.390 --> 00:36:40.714
You will go mad but you cannot reach to the point.

00:36:40.900 --> 00:36:45.056
So  if you can stop reasoning and try to see

00:36:45.081 --> 00:36:49.342
if there’s another way out without reasoning,

00:36:49.367 --> 00:36:53.209
then this kundalini rises in an ancient way

00:36:53.234 --> 00:36:56.557
and can happen to all of you.  There’s no problem.

00:36:56.666 --> 00:37:01.029
And ones you get it then you start understanding

00:37:01.054 --> 00:37:05.194
that there’s a..another system beyond us

00:37:05.219 --> 00:37:07.842
which guides us, which helps us.

00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:10.274
So the reasoning takes you nowhere.

00:37:10.299 --> 00:37:14.583
All the problem of today is because of reasoning.

00:37:21.350 --> 00:37:30.196
Lady: You speak of a hospital where people are not given medication.

00:37:30.221 --> 00:37:32.485
But they are healed.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:34.874
Can you tell me more about that?

00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:36.982
You are healed?

00:37:37.386 --> 00:37:38.102
Saying what?

00:37:38.126 --> 00:37:41.135
Yogi: Asking how are people healed in hospital?

00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.191
I told you just now.  You see,

00:37:43.216 --> 00:37:49.065
these are the centers which look after our material side

00:37:49.090 --> 00:37:52.695
and also our physical welfare.

00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:55.800
So once it rises, this kundalini

00:37:55.825 --> 00:37:57.843
She nourishes those centers.

00:37:57.868 --> 00:38:00.878
Now I’ll tell you example you say of cancer.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.106
Yogi: Hello, Hello, Hello

00:38:25.026 --> 00:38:30.869
Now..say, these centers are formed,

00:38:30.894 --> 00:38:35.224
as you know, within us we have autonomous nervous system.

00:38:35.239 --> 00:38:40.787
And autonomous nervous system has got three channels,

00:38:40.812 --> 00:38:44.830
the center one and the two others.

00:38:45.104 --> 00:38:51.581
So very little is known about this parasympathetic nervous system.

00:38:51.606 --> 00:38:55.051
About the medical science they know very little.

00:38:55.214 --> 00:38:58.893
From the left and the right, say for example,

00:38:58.939 --> 00:39:03.322
these two forces coming and form the central path.

00:39:03.459 --> 00:39:06.113
In this resides the,

00:39:06.138 --> 00:39:10.295
we should say, the energy for the particular area, alright?

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.095
Now what happens we start using this either on the right or the left,

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:17.478
say for the journalist it’s more the right side they use.

00:39:17.503 --> 00:39:22.015
Because they have to think, futuristic you see all that.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.695
Now you start using them too much on this side.

00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.795
So you start moving like this.

00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:30.374
And there is exhaustion of the energy also.

00:39:30.399 --> 00:39:33.638
So what happens suddenly, something happens in life,

00:39:33.663 --> 00:39:36.879
some accident, something, some emotional problem

00:39:36.904 --> 00:39:41.640
so the left side which is the emotional side just gets out.

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.094
So as a result you lose your connection with the whole.

00:39:46.227 --> 00:39:48.017
With the whole you lose.

00:39:48.343 --> 00:39:52.198
So you become working on your own.

00:39:52.223 --> 00:39:54.535
So you become malignant.

00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:58.395
This malignancy is the thing that works as cancer.

00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:01.888
With kundalini what She does, She goes here just like a tread

00:40:01.913 --> 00:40:04.706
and then She goes here, She brings them together.

00:40:04.731 --> 00:40:06.781
And then she nourishes them.

00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.911
So you get cured.

00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:14.840
Lady: So how do you personally reach that stage.

00:40:14.865 --> 00:40:16.960
You talked about the spirituality.

00:40:17.298 --> 00:40:22.638
Yeah, That’s why I am saying that your kundalini has to be awakened.

00:40:22.860 --> 00:40:24.764
First that has to happen.

00:40:24.893 --> 00:40:28.546
Then you must have faith in yourself that you can work it out.

00:40:28.571 --> 00:40:30.724
If you are diffident or oh I am …

00:40:30.738 --> 00:40:32.915
See all there are all kinds of people there.

00:40:33.199 --> 00:40:36.099
They are people who are very guilty.

00:40:36.124 --> 00:40:37.835
Like, how can I get it?

00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:40.938
I have done this thing, I have done that thing.

00:40:40.963 --> 00:40:44.130
That’s one type which catches this centre.

00:40:44.155 --> 00:40:47.155
Another kind are very arrogant.

00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.715
They catch on this side you see.

00:40:49.898 --> 00:40:52.397
So this has to be corrected.

00:40:59.223 --> 00:41:02.324
Man: The vibrated water.

00:41:02.350 --> 00:41:03.710
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:41:03.882 --> 00:41:09.273
Man: The vibrated water.  You spoke about vibrated water.

00:41:09.298 --> 00:41:11.235
Where does it come from?

00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:14.762
It comes from people who have vibrations.

00:41:14.787 --> 00:41:17.678
Those who are realized their souls have vibrations.

00:41:17.703 --> 00:41:20.813
They can feel the cool breeze in their hands.

00:41:20.838 --> 00:41:24.648
Even if they put hand in the water it is vibrated.

00:41:27.318 --> 00:41:30.872
All such people, saints and all that,

00:41:30.897 --> 00:41:33.595
whatever water comes from them is vibrated.

00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:38.463
For example the river, Ganga here, Ganges is, has got vibrations.

00:41:38.566 --> 00:41:42.595
I mean, you have to become that then you can feel it, right?

00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:46.161
Unless and until you have that, subtle within you,

00:41:46.186 --> 00:41:47.315
you cannot feel it.

00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:49.151
To you everybody is just the same.

00:41:49.158 --> 00:41:51.304
Every bottle is just the same.

00:41:51.633 --> 00:41:53.148
I’ll give you an example.

00:41:53.173 --> 00:41:54.940
I went to Kashmir

00:41:56.461 --> 00:42:00.526
and suddenly I felt.  We were going out somewhere actually [UNCLEAR Nibwel].

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:02.185
Lots of vibration.

00:42:02.210 --> 00:42:06.365
So I asked the driver, What do you have a temple here, something?

00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:08.269
How do I feel the vibrations?

00:42:08.630 --> 00:42:10.471
He said we don’t have any temple here.

00:42:10.496 --> 00:42:12.946
I said, “Alright, I will tell you, go this way.”

00:42:12.971 --> 00:42:15.625
That’s the (side) vibrations were coming.  We went that way.

00:42:15.650 --> 00:42:19.025
There were some Muslim houses some very poor people.

00:42:19.322 --> 00:42:22.429
So I asked them, “What do you have here?”

00:42:23.540 --> 00:42:26.075
So he said, “It’s the Hazrat Bal.”

00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:30.414
One hair of Mohammad Sahab was kept.

00:42:30.773 --> 00:42:34.475
[UNCLEAR]…I get vibration.

00:42:35.780 --> 00:42:39.115
But these stupid people, they did not know anything, what it was.

00:42:39.140 --> 00:42:43.140
They are fighting for it and they..also the driver didn’t know what it was.

00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:50.689
So whatever I say has to be tested on vibration

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.475
So whatever I say has to be tested on vibration,

00:42:55.500 --> 00:43:01.049
which is your own, which is your own testing capacity.

00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.549
The capacity otherwise is blunt,

00:43:04.574 --> 00:43:06.535
it doesn’t give you the real picture.

00:43:06.560 --> 00:43:09.361
But supposing have vibrations you can feel it.

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:11.510
Who has got it?

00:43:11.760 --> 00:43:14.067
Where you have it?

00:43:15.293 --> 00:43:20.528
It’s a very subtle thing but once it is there it works.

00:43:28.344 --> 00:43:31.263
Man: How does one attain such a state where you can?

00:43:31.277 --> 00:43:33.795
Yogi: How can one attain this state.

00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.235
It’s very simple.  You can all attain it here only.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:38.370
It's very simple.

00:43:38.395 --> 00:43:42.955
Now what has happened is that, I would say, that

00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:49.370
in the 12th century [1200s] in this country,

00:43:50.023 --> 00:43:54.605
up to that time we had a group of people called as Nathpanthis.

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:57.825
I mean we had all this all over the world.

00:43:57.850 --> 00:44:00.069
There have been so many Nabis.

00:44:00.094 --> 00:44:02.582
But in this country we had.

00:44:03.730 --> 00:44:06.585
And there it was a law I would say,

00:44:06.610 --> 00:44:10.890
traditional, that one person could give realization to another person,

00:44:10.915 --> 00:44:13.203
only one, one to one.

00:44:14.110 --> 00:44:20.305
Then, you see, there was a great poet called Gyanadeva,
Gyaneshwara.

00:44:20.330 --> 00:44:22.475
He wrote all this at the age of 23

00:44:22.500 --> 00:44:24.997
you can imagine, what he must be.

00:44:25.022 --> 00:44:29.098
And he asked his guru that he should permit him

00:44:29.123 --> 00:44:31.863
to at least write about it.

00:44:31.990 --> 00:44:35.489
So in his book Gyaneshwari he wrote.

00:44:35.516 --> 00:44:38.330
On the sixth chapter he wrote about it,

00:44:38.355 --> 00:44:41.381
that such and such energy he sees and all that.

00:44:41.406 --> 00:44:43.798
But nobody used to give realization.

00:44:43.990 --> 00:44:48.090
Then in the sixteenth century there were many poets who wrote about it.

00:44:48.115 --> 00:44:50.480
I mean Guru Nanaka wrote about it,

00:44:50.854 --> 00:44:52.925
 Kabira wrote about it, everybody.

00:44:52.950 --> 00:44:55.610
But nobody understood what they wrote because

00:44:55.635 --> 00:44:59.685
see normally people didn’t know what they were talking about.

00:44:59.710 --> 00:45:05.789
And after that sixteenth century it became yet still the same problem

00:45:05.814 --> 00:45:09.238
that one guru would give it to another.

00:45:10.189 --> 00:45:16.656
So when I was born…I was born I was myself a realized soul

00:45:16.930 --> 00:45:22.685
and my father himself was a saint.

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:26.046
He told me as you know that is your mission is,

00:45:26.071 --> 00:45:31.844
to find out a way to give self realization am masse.

00:45:32.323 --> 00:45:35.575
So I worked it out myself.

00:45:35.749 --> 00:45:42.374
I by chance or I should…by luck my father was a very social person

00:45:42.399 --> 00:45:48.010
and I met many of his people.

00:45:48.035 --> 00:45:50.225
My husband too very social

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:53.225
and I used to study human beings what’s the matter.

00:45:53.250 --> 00:45:55.725
Why can’t they get realization?

00:45:55.750 --> 00:46:00.583
So if I’ve done anything it is this that I’ve discovered a method by which

00:46:00.608 --> 00:46:03.754
am mass realization can be (done).

00:46:04.030 --> 00:46:08.752
And that’s how thousands can get realization at a time.

00:46:16.897 --> 00:46:18.775
Man: [UNCLEAR So]….can we experience that?

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:19.830
Alright.

00:46:20.798 --> 00:46:25.633
they can all have it. You see so many sahaja yogis sitting here, no problem.

00:46:31.707 --> 00:46:32.886
Alright,

00:46:33.959 --> 00:46:36.820
Only thing you have to do is take out the shoes.

00:46:36.845 --> 00:46:38.349
Not the socks but the shoes.

00:46:38.374 --> 00:46:40.475
Will be better that way.

00:46:44.232 --> 00:46:47.840
Alright put both the feet apart from each other.

00:46:55.225 --> 00:47:01.943
Now just put your both the hands towards me like that.

00:47:13.013 --> 00:47:17.875
It is not mesmerism because I close my eyes you see.

00:47:17.900 --> 00:47:20.881
They mesmerize with the eyes.

00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:22.295
And don’t doubt.

00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.426
Just now don’t doubt yourself.  It’s the main thing.

00:47:25.860 --> 00:47:27.675
How can I get it?

00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:30.555
I have done this wrong.  I have done that wrong.

00:47:30.580 --> 00:47:34.939
So as first of all you should not have any guilt.

00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:38.125
You must forgive yourself.

00:47:38.310 --> 00:47:42.045
At the same time you should also forgive others.

00:47:42.070 --> 00:47:44.137
Is very important.

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:47.806
Because if you don’t forgive others you play into their hands

00:47:47.831 --> 00:47:51.865
and bother yourself for their sake.

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:54.685
So best thing is to forgive.

00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:57.085
Forgive them all, one and all.

00:47:57.110 --> 00:47:59.584
Now many say we can’t forgive.

00:48:00.030 --> 00:48:01.685
Actually you don’t do anything.

00:48:01.710 --> 00:48:03.625
What do you do if you don’t forgive?

00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:05.745
You are just torturing yourself.

00:48:05.770 --> 00:48:08.914
So best thing is you just feel within yourself,

00:48:08.939 --> 00:48:13.451
just say that I forgive every one of them,

00:48:23.926 --> 00:48:28.560
which will open out your throat chakra which is very important.

00:48:28.585 --> 00:48:32.189
That will open out completely your, also your Agnya chakra

00:48:32.214 --> 00:48:38.815
which is very important is the…within the optic chiasma you have this

00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:46.615
so this chakras are to be opened out by your saying only.

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.348
It’s like a we can call it a mantra.

00:48:49.372 --> 00:48:55.642
Just by saying that I am forgiving everyone

00:48:55.667 --> 00:48:56.988
I want to forgive everyone.

00:48:57.013 --> 00:48:59.665
And I’ve forgiven everyone.

00:49:10.669 --> 00:49:13.659
Now you have to ask for it in your heart,

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:17.129
”Mother please give me my self-realization.”

00:49:17.230 --> 00:49:18.305
That’s all.

00:49:18.330 --> 00:49:21.906
You have to ask three times that’s all.

00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:40.176
Now keep your right hand towards me and left hand on top of your head.

00:49:40.201 --> 00:49:41.755
Now close your eyes.

00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:45.412
Top of your head over the fontanel bone area

00:49:45.437 --> 00:49:48.300
and don’t touch your head on top.

00:49:49.226 --> 00:49:51.700
Bend your head.  Bend your head.

00:49:51.900 --> 00:49:55.900
Please bend your head.  And see if there’s a cool

00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:01.387
or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area

00:50:01.412 --> 00:50:04.513
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

00:50:04.538 --> 00:50:06.575
Close your eyes and bend your head.

00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:08.017
See for yourself.

00:50:10.006 --> 00:50:12.738
You can move your hand and see.

00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:16.235
If it’s hot then means you have not yet forgiven.

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:17.815
That’s important.

00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:18.789
But doesn’t matter.

00:50:18.814 --> 00:50:20.955
Even if it is hot it is alright.

00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:25.475
It’s throwing away all that ill feelings within you.

00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:27.627
So it’s hot.

00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.804
Now put the left hand towards…

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:37.397
Now with the right hand…please bend your head.

00:50:39.066 --> 00:50:43.964
With the right hand you bend your head and see for yourself.

00:50:51.620 --> 00:50:58.612
You can move your hand up on the sides and see for yourself

00:50:58.637 --> 00:51:05.287
that there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming on you, in you, through you.

00:51:05.312 --> 00:51:06.724
But don’t doubt yourself.

00:51:06.749 --> 00:51:07.931
You all can get it.

00:51:07.956 --> 00:51:10.332
You all are quite capable of getting it.

00:51:10.357 --> 00:51:12.787
So don’t doubt yourself.

00:51:40.255 --> 00:51:42.774
Now raise your hands little higher.

00:51:42.799 --> 00:51:44.600
Open your eyes.

00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:52.095
Some of you are getting here and here.

00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:54.377
So you have to turn it upwards like this.

00:51:54.402 --> 00:51:59.036
If you are getting that way.  From here to here.

00:51:59.869 --> 00:52:00.775
Doesn’t matter.

00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:07.898
Now see for yourself.  Hands up..

00:52:09.072 --> 00:52:16.299
Now all those who are getting cool or hot breeze on their fingers

00:52:16.324 --> 00:52:20.755
or on their palms or out of their heads anywhere,

00:52:20.780 --> 00:52:22.776
please raise your hands.

00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:35.095
All the journalists have got.

00:52:35.120 --> 00:52:37.512
Now, it should work out.

00:52:37.537 --> 00:52:38.540
Work it out.

00:52:38.565 --> 00:52:40.155
They'll work it out.

00:52:41.890 --> 00:52:42.485
That’s it.

00:52:42.510 --> 00:52:45.332
That’s it you have to admit.

00:52:46.539 --> 00:52:48.277
He has got.

00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:49.859
You haven’t got?

00:52:49.884 --> 00:52:53.588
Now see.  Just put on your hand.

00:52:54.502 --> 00:52:56.048
Journalism!..

00:53:14.967 --> 00:53:15.782
Doesn't matter.

00:53:15.813 --> 00:53:18.713
You are now getting.  but you are doubting.

00:53:23.239 --> 00:53:25.254
Come along.

00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:42.548
Just see this.

00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:45.753
He's got it. He's got it.

00:53:45.778 --> 00:53:47.518
What about you?

00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:49.459
No?

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:50.935
Now don’t doubt.

00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:54.304
Don’t doubt yourself is the main point.

00:54:01.030 --> 00:54:03.166
he’s brought all of them.

00:54:17.705 --> 00:54:19.725
He’s got it. Now believe in it. Believe in it.

00:54:19.750 --> 00:54:21.416
It is there.

00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.760
He too has got it.

00:54:44.990 --> 00:54:46.810
What about you? You got it. What about you?

00:54:48.090 --> 00:54:49.355
Not yet?

00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:55.975
You think …do his right and left.

00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:58.570
Do his right to the left.

00:55:02.110 --> 00:55:04.108
How are you?
