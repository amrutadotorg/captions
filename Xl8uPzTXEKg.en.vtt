00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:00.880
Public Program  25 April 2001
Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey)

00:00:57.146 --> 00:01:01.873
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.222
I have been coming to Turkey in the last ten years.

00:01:19.087 --> 00:01:27.012
And I found this place is so much filled with spirituality.

00:01:32.775 --> 00:01:36.622
Perhaps we have had so many Sufis here,

00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:44.598
must be something in this country
is that there were so many Sufis were created.

00:01:51.367 --> 00:01:56.316
And I have read about them and
I have read about Rumi and all others.

00:01:56.506 --> 00:02:02.690
And I find they described the qualities of a Sufi

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:07.069
the state of his mind, very beautiful.

00:02:26.373 --> 00:02:31.001
But they didn't say how created, how to became Sufis.

00:02:36.702 --> 00:02:42.214
They described of course  very well
and absolutely  truthfully

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:46.375
whatever was the achievement.

00:02:55.524 --> 00:03:00.098
But nobody could say that how they achieved it.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.512
Even in the Kuran you see how Muhammed Sahab has described

00:03:14.703 --> 00:03:21.092
that he went through seventh heavens  on a white horse.

00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:34.502
He was a poet and the whole thing was so poetic.

00:03:39.756 --> 00:03:42.749
The white horse was this Kundalini.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.178
The more you will know about Kundalini
you will see how poetically

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.147
He had described all these seven heavens he crossed over.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.904
So, unless and until you are self realized soul

00:04:17.246 --> 00:04:19.912
as he has said "know thy self".

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:25.863
Unless and until you know your self
you can not understand any one of this scriptures.

00:04:42.124 --> 00:04:48.351
They say, all of them say the same thing
in different ways and also in poetry.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.413
And it is difficult for common people to understand.

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:18.956
In no way there is difference in the
explanations of all these scriptures,

00:05:19.076 --> 00:05:21.734
they are just the same.

00:05:32.304 --> 00:05:35.896
Then there is no question of people fighting

00:05:36.236 --> 00:05:39.935
because there is no difference  what they are fighting for.

00:05:50.122 --> 00:05:56.944
But  problem was one individual gets the self realization

00:05:57.188 --> 00:06:01.652
and the others don’t understand
they torture that person.

00:06:14.408 --> 00:06:16.843
As you know Christ was crucified

00:06:16.956 --> 00:06:21.244
and all the saints, all the sages were tortured.

00:06:32.078 --> 00:06:36.619
Even in China there was this Tao.

00:06:36.762 --> 00:06:39.620
It was the same thing as Sahaja Yoga

00:06:39.756 --> 00:06:43.425
but it was written in such a manner

00:06:43.492 --> 00:06:49.606
that people could not understand it or
I think couldn't take it what it was written.

00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:10.786
Also I find in Japan,Vidittama is a deciple of
(mahatma welcome book.Gautam Budda)

00:07:11.153 --> 00:07:14.051
He said the same things,

00:07:14.187 --> 00:07:18.830
he tried to practice Sahaja Yoga through
various methods

00:07:18.975 --> 00:07:23.320
all was nothing but Kundalini awakening.

00:07:48.090 --> 00:07:55.606
Now the thing is of understanding
then go to any limit of stupitidies.

00:08:04.712 --> 00:08:09.952
There was a great poet called Kabir in India

00:08:16.174 --> 00:08:21.417
and whatever he told was so much
misunderstood by people

00:08:21.579 --> 00:08:27.700
that you can not imagine
what interpretations they do.

00:08:39.907 --> 00:08:48.051
He says in one  poetry that my beloved
went away and  I  did not  cry.

00:08:57.605 --> 00:09:01.706
Now people think beloved means a lover.

00:09:02.029 --> 00:09:06.638
It is what he was meaning was a life  life went away.

00:09:06.741 --> 00:09:09.598
But, I did not cry,   I didn't say anything.

00:09:21.193 --> 00:09:24.254
So he was saying about the death

00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:30.237
while people all these thinks it is some sort of
a beloved he is talking about.

00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:45.921
Thus you see, we have problems, of people fighting

00:09:45.946 --> 00:09:50.882
who said they are fighting is a name of religion.

00:10:00.612 --> 00:10:06.554
To understand they have  first you take your self realization.

00:10:12.705 --> 00:10:15.223
You have to know yourself.

00:10:15.953 --> 00:10:18.997
Unless and until you know yourself

00:10:19.022 --> 00:10:24.082
how will you understand the subtle ideas they want to look forward.

00:10:37.379 --> 00:10:43.066
So whatever they have told you about
the Kundalini it is a fact,

00:10:43.626 --> 00:10:47.844
it is a fact and  resides within you in the triangular bone.

00:10:59.251 --> 00:11:04.959
You could be a Muslim you could be a Hindu
you could be a Christian anything.

00:11:05.571 --> 00:11:09.001
Even people from Africa came.

00:11:09.039 --> 00:11:13.198
They were black, some were white, some were yellow,

00:11:13.243 --> 00:11:17.584
all of them have got this Kundalini within them.

00:11:32.169 --> 00:11:35.478
As  God has created us the same.

00:11:35.521 --> 00:11:42.833
we all have noses, hands everything,
everywhere whatever languages we may speak.

00:11:52.681 --> 00:11:57.921
Now, Sahaja means, saha means "with" and ja  "born with you".

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:03.582
The right to get this yoga, union with the divine, the ruh.

00:12:16.779 --> 00:12:19.787
You all have this right

00:12:19.908 --> 00:12:22.571
and now it is going to work out

00:12:22.596 --> 00:12:27.142
that you have to know yourself through the Kundalini awakening.

00:12:39.334 --> 00:12:43.802
All this may be not written in those books.

00:12:43.827 --> 00:12:46.429
Perhaps that was not the time to write

00:12:46.468 --> 00:12:51.340
or maybe these books were written after long time

00:12:51.438 --> 00:12:54.915
after the prophet went away, Christ die in all that.

00:12:54.935 --> 00:12:58.451
So there are certain sacrifice you see.

00:13:14.516 --> 00:13:21.526
But it is a fact that, you whole have,
all of you have this power within you,

00:13:21.551 --> 00:13:26.150
this energy within you which we call as Kundalini.

00:13:35.988 --> 00:13:37.812
It has been proved now

00:13:37.851 --> 00:13:41.242
because wherever I have gone many countries

00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:46.232
various type of people were there
and they all got their realization.

00:13:55.814 --> 00:14:00.459
Especially in Turkey is a very dear country to me

00:14:00.494 --> 00:14:04.757
because of so many people who were here

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:09.489
and  who  were  spiritually so equipped

00:14:09.638 --> 00:14:14.123
they might call themselves  as Sufis,
I mean Sufi means [UNCLEAR].

00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:30.840
So it cleanses, means this Kundalini rising

00:14:30.915 --> 00:14:35.710
cleanses you of your problems, of your enemies.

00:14:48.911 --> 00:14:51.331
Because it connects you

00:14:51.585 --> 00:14:55.550
to the all pervading power which we call as Ruh

00:14:55.621 --> 00:15:01.926
and all your personality absolutely
get absorbed with the truth.

00:15:17.977 --> 00:15:22.894
The first thing that happens to you when she rises,

00:15:22.963 --> 00:15:28.978
sometimes it is you just  become thoughtlessly aware.

00:15:40.396 --> 00:15:44.713
The thoughts come to us because we react.

00:15:44.973 --> 00:15:49.020
We see something immediately we react.

00:15:59.039 --> 00:16:06.094
We react according to our ego or maybe
according to our conditioning.

00:16:14.568 --> 00:16:19.822
But when the Kundalini she rises and
crosses this center upward

00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:22.563
then your thoughts stop.

00:16:35.547 --> 00:16:38.003
Then you become a witness.

00:16:38.051 --> 00:16:41.227
You witness without thinking.

00:16:50.245 --> 00:16:53.166
Thought  rises then falls

00:16:53.191 --> 00:16:57.027
then another thought comes up, rises and falls.

00:17:06.157 --> 00:17:09.746
There is a space, very little space in between

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:12.393
but we cannot see that space,

00:17:12.426 --> 00:17:15.100
we can not in there  that space.

00:17:26.204 --> 00:17:32.000
Now these thoughts who are all the time [UNCLEAR]
hoovering  in your head

00:17:32.025 --> 00:17:34.962
and our  mind cruise or jumping on them

00:17:35.005 --> 00:17:38.292
doesn’t allow us to be in the present

00:17:38.317 --> 00:17:42.201
because they come from the past and from the future.

00:18:02.236 --> 00:18:06.521
So we cannot be in the present.

00:18:10.729 --> 00:18:15.539
Past is finished it does not exist
and the future is no more,

00:18:15.702 --> 00:18:20.537
so what we have to do is to stay in the present.

00:18:32.787 --> 00:18:36.554
And in the present is the reality, is the truth.

00:18:42.441 --> 00:18:45.538
That is how we can not enjoying.

00:18:50.617 --> 00:18:55.180
For example, I see a very beautiful carpet here,
very beautiful

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.589
and I start reacting on it

00:18:57.622 --> 00:19:03.071
and then I start thinking of how much is that  cost,

00:19:03.177 --> 00:19:06.004
can I have it, all things is possible.

00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:20.557
but I can not watch it.

00:19:23.468 --> 00:19:25.507
Because I can not watch it

00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:30.193
the joy that  is put by the artist  in the sight
I can not enjoy it.

00:19:41.795 --> 00:19:43.965
So when this Kundalini rises

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:50.124
what she does,  she elongates those toughts
there is a space   between a  thought.

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:06.976
So we can see everything without thinking and enjoy fully.

00:20:17.178 --> 00:20:20.556
And with this enjoyment we get peace,

00:20:20.581 --> 00:20:22.591
complete peace.

00:20:31.545 --> 00:20:35.227
We do not agress others, we enjoy others.

00:20:44.468 --> 00:20:47.152
They have  many peace conferences

00:20:47.177 --> 00:20:51.273
but those who are having the conference have no peace within –

00:20:51.298 --> 00:20:54.196
then what is the use of having the conference?

00:21:05.702 --> 00:21:09.387
We have six enemies within us at least

00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:12.008
which are all the time torturing us.

00:21:20.366 --> 00:21:24.373
They are described in the Sanskrit language very beautifully

00:21:24.439 --> 00:21:26.806
but I will tell them, that's now [UNCLEAR].

00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:39.185
First is the anger.

00:21:41.996 --> 00:21:44.436
That is so common,

00:21:44.461 --> 00:21:47.478
comes out of  so much of conditioning

00:21:47.503 --> 00:21:49.830
may be so much of ego.

00:21:59.144 --> 00:22:01.415
Then the perversion,

00:22:01.447 --> 00:22:08.189
perversion of sex or
all kinds of dirty things people do it.

00:22:16.921 --> 00:22:19.921
Then we have false pride,

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:30.527
now we have jealousy

00:22:32.413 --> 00:22:34.661
we have attachments.

00:22:38.414 --> 00:22:41.906
People are corrupt because
they are attached to their children,

00:22:41.961 --> 00:22:45.719
they want to make money for them,
so  they are corrupt.

00:22:58.532 --> 00:23:00.285
And we have  also attraction.

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:04.239
We are attracted supposing somebody is attracted,

00:23:04.256 --> 00:23:09.291
say towards good clothes somebody attracted or good house

00:23:09.355 --> 00:23:11.467
attractions.

00:23:29.241 --> 00:23:31.368
We cannot explain.

00:23:31.433 --> 00:23:34.400
We cannot explain why we do that.

00:23:39.492 --> 00:23:43.423
Why we suffer from all these enemies we don't know.

00:23:49.022 --> 00:23:53.554
Once you become the spirit,

00:23:53.579 --> 00:23:57.080
spirit drops out everything,

00:23:57.093 --> 00:23:59.960
it is so clear, so clean,

00:23:59.985 --> 00:24:04.538
and  what is the spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

00:24:20.623 --> 00:24:23.551
The spirit , that is within you.

00:24:23.576 --> 00:24:29.557
once it  enlightens you, you become such a wonderful person,

00:24:29.589 --> 00:24:34.502
such a nice person and you develop this spirituality.

00:24:47.525 --> 00:24:51.429
What, actually what happens is

00:24:51.456 --> 00:24:53.979
that when  Kundalini rises

00:24:54.006 --> 00:24:58.755
your spirit starts emitting vibrations

00:24:58.811 --> 00:25:03.503
spiritual vibrations on your central nervous system.

00:25:15.767 --> 00:25:21.284
And you start feeling cool breeze on your hands

00:25:21.366 --> 00:25:24.153
out of your fontanel bone area.

00:25:37.865 --> 00:25:42.336
And then this  fingers which represent

00:25:42.447 --> 00:25:47.249
the centers within you  starts speaking telling you
what's wrong and what's kind.

00:26:03.616 --> 00:26:09.031
Also they tell you about others,
what is wrong with the others.

00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:21.965
This connection with the divine
gives you this blessing

00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:25.633
that you  know what is wrong with you
and what is wrong with others.

00:26:40.112 --> 00:26:42.663
Even the doctors will not tell you,

00:26:42.710 --> 00:26:47.014
nobody can tell you, just now on your fingertips

00:26:57.925 --> 00:27:03.568
So in the Kuran it says at the time of kıyam
your hands will speak.

00:27:11.393 --> 00:27:15.345
So this is the kiyam time, kiyamat is different.

00:27:15.370 --> 00:27:17.594
[UNCLEAR]

00:27:17.635 --> 00:27:19.182
Kıyamat and kıyama

00:27:24.150 --> 00:27:28.705
Kyam because this is the last judgement.

00:27:33.436 --> 00:27:39.080
Those who do not accept their self realisation,

00:27:39.173 --> 00:27:45.825
and who don't get into the heavenly bliss of divinity,

00:27:45.906 --> 00:27:50.472
they go to hell – that is the wisdom.

00:28:00.888 --> 00:28:05.255
So, for you it is important that your hands must speak

00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:08.059
and tell you about you and others.

00:28:18.421 --> 00:28:22.058
That is how you are mussulman, otherwise you are not.

00:28:28.496 --> 00:28:31.220
If your hands do not speak

00:28:31.245 --> 00:28:34.311
than you are not a mussulman in surrendering.

00:28:41.527 --> 00:28:44.594
It`s all said, it is all written in the Quran

00:28:44.614 --> 00:28:49.417
but once you be  able to read it after
you have got your realization.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:03.020
It is high time that you should realize

00:29:03.052 --> 00:29:06.625
that we  have been following something so much

00:29:06.658 --> 00:29:09.111
and why is it we are in trouble,

00:29:09.151 --> 00:29:14.230
why we have not been able to achieve whatever is promised.

00:29:27.641 --> 00:29:31.179
It is something missing

00:29:31.212 --> 00:29:34.858
that so far we have not been able to

00:29:34.890 --> 00:29:37.352
achieve what is doing promised.

00:30:01.816 --> 00:30:05.197
You all can have your self realization.

00:30:09.054 --> 00:30:13.403
Don’t have any fear about it and some

00:30:13.444 --> 00:30:16.382
sort of funny ideas about it.

00:30:23.867 --> 00:30:28.215
Because whatever will happen, you will feel it.

00:30:34.872 --> 00:30:37.324
It`s not something imaginary.

00:30:41.709 --> 00:30:43.812
It’s the actualization.

00:30:47.706 --> 00:30:52.105
To the Christians I say this actualization of  baptism.

00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:05.713
So, it's your chance now all of you so many have  come

00:31:05.785 --> 00:31:08.158
to have that self realization.

00:31:17.742 --> 00:31:21.805
It was prophesied that it will happen collectively.

00:31:28.073 --> 00:31:30.461
And so, you all deserve it.

00:31:30.486 --> 00:31:32.152
And you should have it.

00:31:32.191 --> 00:31:35.214
Because İt is what  is promised.

00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:46.325
So ultimately what happens

00:31:46.350 --> 00:31:49.320
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

00:31:55.842 --> 00:31:58.739
You become powerfull.

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.736
But you don't have ego.

00:32:05.856 --> 00:32:10.454
And you know how you get help others

00:32:10.487 --> 00:32:13.740
and yourself and help the family.

00:32:22.693 --> 00:32:24.494
All of you can get  it.

00:32:28.215 --> 00:32:34.741
I mean those who want can all get it ,
it can't be forced [UNCLEAR].

00:32:42.813 --> 00:32:49.943
Thus you will know what you are and also what othes are.

00:32:58.485 --> 00:33:02.119
Many people have  been cured in sahaja yoga, no doubt.

00:33:02.207 --> 00:33:05.262
We also have a hospital in India.

00:33:15.503 --> 00:33:20.844
Where people are cured without any medicine
with their own vibrations.

00:33:30.403 --> 00:33:35.879
Moreover mentally there are so many people
who have been cured.

00:33:43.192 --> 00:33:45.725
And your problems are solved.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:50.352
Because you get out  of your problems.

00:33:57.771 --> 00:34:03.842
Will be amazed how miraculously
you achieve such small small things

00:34:03.867 --> 00:34:06.901
which really look great [UNCLEAR] to begin with.

00:34:17.011 --> 00:34:21.828
Every human being has a right  to get self realization.

00:34:27.469 --> 00:34:33.080
All negative forces and energies  just
drop out and run away.

00:34:41.235 --> 00:34:46.520
Just like whether light comes in all darkness goes away.

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:54.843
It sometimes  people don't believe.

00:34:54.868 --> 00:34:59.585
Because, they don't think they are
capable of getting self realization.

00:35:10.165 --> 00:35:14.633
But, I am sure tonight you will learn what you are.

00:35:21.454 --> 00:35:26.501
Will be absolutely relaxed person and

00:35:26.533 --> 00:35:31.453
the whole being  will be filled with joy and divine love.

00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:46.525
It's not because of me, it's because of you.

00:35:51.604 --> 00:36:00.408
You have once you have what only
I have to open the window here.

00:36:07.822 --> 00:36:11.211
That to you do because It is your desire,

00:36:11.251 --> 00:36:15.046
to become your pure desire to be.

00:36:24.048 --> 00:36:27.460
Otherwise no other desire is pure.

00:36:32.527 --> 00:36:39.177
All economics is based on one point
that no human desire is complete.

00:36:49.761 --> 00:36:54.443
Today you want  to have one thing then
you want to have another thing.

00:36:59.604 --> 00:37:03.286
And you are never satisfied.

00:37:06.710 --> 00:37:09.059
But this  is pure desire.

00:37:09.324 --> 00:37:15.126
Kundalini is the energy of pure desire
because the desire of our Almighty

00:37:23.654 --> 00:37:27.466
So, when you get your realization,

00:37:27.526 --> 00:37:33.319
you feel absolutely satisfied and
enjoy whatever you have.

00:37:43.888 --> 00:37:48.484
And also you enjoy others and their things

00:37:48.708 --> 00:37:52.700
without thinking that they don't belong to you.

00:38:06.276 --> 00:38:08.887
The whole panorama changes

00:38:08.895 --> 00:38:14.950
and you become a very universal personality.

00:38:22.364 --> 00:38:25.110
You really become global

00:38:25.198 --> 00:38:30.547
and everybody who is in sahaja yoga are such great friends.

00:38:41.552 --> 00:38:49.389
I'll give an example that
Palestinians were fighting Israelis

00:38:49.542 --> 00:38:54.211
and one of the Israeli fellow, telephoned  to me

00:38:54.272 --> 00:39:01.518
that Mother we have some Sahaja Yogis
in  the  one of the villages of  Palestine.

00:39:14.235 --> 00:39:19.804
They were friends,  despite the fact that
[UNCLEAR] is fighting, countries were fighting.

00:39:19.845 --> 00:39:23.548
But they were Sahaja Yogis,
so they were friends they are friends.

00:39:38.522 --> 00:39:44.730
So this Israilian knew that
they are going to drop a big bomb

00:39:44.794 --> 00:39:49.376
in a particular village and he told me that
please pay  attention Mother

00:39:49.417 --> 00:39:52.094
I don't want  people to be killed  there.

00:40:06.078 --> 00:40:11.284
I give pay attention and they never drop the bomb.

00:40:16.948 --> 00:40:21.122
Love is the most powerful thing human beings have all.

00:40:27.335 --> 00:40:29.763
We have never used it.

00:40:29.888 --> 00:40:35.034
We have always use hatred to over power others.

00:40:42.998 --> 00:40:46.775
We have never used love.

00:40:50.452 --> 00:40:56.191
There is divine love allover  allover the world
that's why we are existing .

00:41:02.663 --> 00:41:06.408
You have to just become one within that's all.

00:41:12.512 --> 00:41:16.972
It's allover, it is called Ruh , It's allover.

00:41:16.997 --> 00:41:19.450
But we have not yet felt.

00:41:27.419 --> 00:41:31.879
But today is now, you have the time to feel it.

00:41:37.631 --> 00:41:41.099
For that you don’t have to concentrate or do anything,

00:41:41.132 --> 00:41:43.639
it will  just work automatically.

00:41:53.644 --> 00:41:56.381
Have faith in yourself.

00:41:59.007 --> 00:42:01.769
Do not condemn yourself.

00:42:06.992 --> 00:42:09.341
This will change the whole world.

00:42:09.420 --> 00:42:13.594
Once they realize that there is divine love
which [UNCLEAR] us.

00:42:25.616 --> 00:42:29.290
So, the first state is thoughtless awareness

00:42:29.323 --> 00:42:36.787
and the second state  is what we called
as the doubtless awareness.

00:42:52.351 --> 00:42:55.818
That state comes to people automatically

00:42:55.827 --> 00:43:00.196
sometimes together and they have no doubts about it.

00:43:09.558 --> 00:43:11.645
It works that way.

00:43:11.670 --> 00:43:17.338
It doesn't give you any doubts anymore
you are sure this is what it is.

00:43:28.671 --> 00:43:31.179
Today somebody came to see me

00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:33.698
he used to perspire and hot.

00:43:33.723 --> 00:43:37.783
And I saw him, he had  problem with his heart,

00:43:37.808 --> 00:43:40.418
to  look working very hard.

00:43:54.300 --> 00:43:57.723
I raised his Kundalini,  he got his realization

00:43:57.748 --> 00:43:59.549
his perspiration stopped.

00:44:08.911 --> 00:44:14.037
So I told him that you should forgive,

00:44:14.046 --> 00:44:17.700
forgive others and that worked.

00:44:25.950 --> 00:44:31.378
And this young fellow would have been very seriously ill

00:44:31.403 --> 00:44:34.948
or dead by that kind of a  heart.

00:44:45.011 --> 00:44:49.807
So you get an awareness which is doubtless.

00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:04.926
So all those who want to have their self realization

00:45:04.951 --> 00:45:06.125
please stay on.

00:45:06.150 --> 00:45:09.157
If you don't want to have
should live the hall.

00:45:19.392 --> 00:45:25.121
One thing, you should not, you cannot pay for spirituality.

00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:34.842
There are many false people
who are doing all  kinds of nonsense,

00:45:34.891 --> 00:45:38.640
only thing is you must take  to your self realization.

00:45:51.084 --> 00:45:54.195
So that you all become Sufis.

00:45:58.037 --> 00:46:00.362
You don't have to give up everything.

00:46:00.387 --> 00:46:03.872
Or you don’t have to become an ascetic,

00:46:10.652 --> 00:46:12.702
and I am a married  woman,

00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:17.420
I have for  children, I have for  grandchildren
and I have got  their grandchildren .

00:46:24.292 --> 00:46:28.682
But I am what I am.

00:46:32.468 --> 00:46:35.110
That’s what should happen to you.

00:46:39.810 --> 00:46:41.722
So again I would request

00:46:41.747 --> 00:46:46.003
those who don’t want have  their
self realization to  leave the hall.

00:46:50.041 --> 00:46:53.556
Like this, like this, just like this. Yes.

00:46:58.978 --> 00:47:01.303
Now  close your eyes.

00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:05.062
Please close.

00:47:10.213 --> 00:47:14.913
See If you are feeling cool breeze on your fingertips

00:47:36.972 --> 00:47:40.941
Now please open your eyes,

00:47:40.959 --> 00:47:42.834
put your left hand towards me

00:47:42.850 --> 00:47:45.707
and put the right hand

00:47:45.757 --> 00:47:52.167
bend your head and put the right hand
against the fontenella bone area

00:47:52.183 --> 00:47:55.050
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

00:48:09.751 --> 00:48:13.136
See if you this coming  on the left hand,

00:48:16.423 --> 00:48:20.687
little it should be above the head not on  top,

00:48:24.079 --> 00:48:26.239
bend your head and see for yourself.

00:48:26.479 --> 00:48:28.472
Move your hand and see for yourself.

00:48:39.057 --> 00:48:41.987
Now please put your right hand towards me,

00:48:44.674 --> 00:48:47.190
not touching the head above

00:48:47.375 --> 00:48:49.835
left hand on the top of your head.

00:48:49.933 --> 00:48:56.875
All those who have felt cool or
hot breeze on their fingertips

00:48:56.877 --> 00:49:01.668
or in the palm or upper to fontanel bone area,

00:49:01.708 --> 00:49:04.120
please raise both your hands.

00:49:20.546 --> 00:49:24.831
All of you got realisation, congratulations.
May God bless you.
