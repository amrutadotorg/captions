00:00.001 --> 00:00.880
Public Program  25 April 2001
Lütfi Kirdar Congress Palace, Istanbul (Turkey)

00:57.146 --> 01:01.873
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

01:11.450 --> 01:15.222
I have been coming to Turkey in the last ten years.

01:19.087 --> 01:27.012
And I found this place is so much filled with spirituality.

01:32.775 --> 01:36.622
Perhaps we have had so many Sufis here,

01:38.711 --> 01:44.598
must be something in this country
is that there were so many Sufis were created.

01:51.367 --> 01:56.316
And I have read about them and
I have read about Rumi and all others.

01:56.506 --> 02:02.690
And I find they described the qualities of a Sufi

02:02.834 --> 02:07.069
the state of his mind, very beautiful.

02:26.373 --> 02:31.001
But they didn't say how created, how to became Sufis.

02:36.702 --> 02:42.214
They described of course  very well
and absolutely  truthfully

02:42.476 --> 02:46.375
whatever was the achievement.

02:55.524 --> 03:00.098
But nobody could say that how they achieved it.

03:06.150 --> 03:14.512
Even in the Kuran you see how Muhammed Sahab has described

03:14.703 --> 03:21.092
that he went through seventh heavens  on a white horse.

03:30.851 --> 03:34.502
He was a poet and the whole thing was so poetic.

03:39.756 --> 03:42.749
The white horse was this Kundalini.

03:46.080 --> 03:51.178
The more you will know about Kundalini
you will see how poetically

03:51.250 --> 03:56.147
He had described all these seven heavens he crossed over.

04:11.400 --> 04:16.904
So, unless and until you are self realized soul

04:17.246 --> 04:19.912
as he has said "know thy self".

04:20.062 --> 04:25.863
Unless and until you know your self
you can not understand any one of this scriptures.

04:42.124 --> 04:48.351
They say, all of them say the same thing
in different ways and also in poetry.

04:58.380 --> 05:03.413
And it is difficult for common people to understand.

05:10.679 --> 05:18.956
In no way there is difference in the
explanations of all these scriptures,

05:19.076 --> 05:21.734
they are just the same.

05:32.304 --> 05:35.896
Then there is no question of people fighting

05:36.236 --> 05:39.935
because there is no difference  what they are fighting for.

05:50.122 --> 05:56.944
But  problem was one individual gets the self realization

05:57.188 --> 06:01.652
and the others don’t understand
they torture that person.

06:14.408 --> 06:16.843
As you know Christ was crucified

06:16.956 --> 06:21.244
and all the saints, all the sages were tortured.

06:32.078 --> 06:36.619
Even in China there was this Tao.

06:36.762 --> 06:39.620
It was the same thing as Sahaja Yoga

06:39.756 --> 06:43.425
but it was written in such a manner

06:43.492 --> 06:49.606
that people could not understand it or
I think couldn't take it what it was written.

07:00.406 --> 07:10.786
Also I find in Japan,Vidittama is a deciple of
(mahatma welcome book.Gautam Budda)

07:11.153 --> 07:14.051
He said the same things,

07:14.187 --> 07:18.830
he tried to practice Sahaja Yoga through
various methods

07:18.975 --> 07:23.320
all was nothing but Kundalini awakening.

07:48.090 --> 07:55.606
Now the thing is of understanding
then go to any limit of stupitidies.

08:04.712 --> 08:09.952
There was a great poet called Kabir in India

08:16.174 --> 08:21.417
and whatever he told was so much
misunderstood by people

08:21.579 --> 08:27.700
that you can not imagine
what interpretations they do.

08:39.907 --> 08:48.051
He says in one  poetry that my beloved
went away and  I  did not  cry.

08:57.605 --> 09:01.706
Now people think beloved means a lover.

09:02.029 --> 09:06.638
It is what he was meaning was a life  life went away.

09:06.741 --> 09:09.598
But, I did not cry,   I didn't say anything.

09:21.193 --> 09:24.254
So he was saying about the death

09:24.460 --> 09:30.237
while people all these thinks it is some sort of
a beloved he is talking about.

09:41.580 --> 09:45.921
Thus you see, we have problems, of people fighting

09:45.946 --> 09:50.882
who said they are fighting is a name of religion.

10:00.612 --> 10:06.554
To understand they have  first you take your self realization.

10:12.705 --> 10:15.223
You have to know yourself.

10:15.953 --> 10:18.997
Unless and until you know yourself

10:19.022 --> 10:24.082
how will you understand the subtle ideas they want to look forward.

10:37.379 --> 10:43.066
So whatever they have told you about
the Kundalini it is a fact,

10:43.626 --> 10:47.844
it is a fact and  resides within you in the triangular bone.

10:59.251 --> 11:04.959
You could be a Muslim you could be a Hindu
you could be a Christian anything.

11:05.571 --> 11:09.001
Even people from Africa came.

11:09.039 --> 11:13.198
They were black, some were white, some were yellow,

11:13.243 --> 11:17.584
all of them have got this Kundalini within them.

11:32.169 --> 11:35.478
As  God has created us the same.

11:35.521 --> 11:42.833
we all have noses, hands everything,
everywhere whatever languages we may speak.

11:52.681 --> 11:57.921
Now, Sahaja means, saha means "with" and ja  "born with you".

11:58.310 --> 12:03.582
The right to get this yoga, union with the divine, the ruh.

12:16.779 --> 12:19.787
You all have this right

12:19.908 --> 12:22.571
and now it is going to work out

12:22.596 --> 12:27.142
that you have to know yourself through the Kundalini awakening.

12:39.334 --> 12:43.802
All this may be not written in those books.

12:43.827 --> 12:46.429
Perhaps that was not the time to write

12:46.468 --> 12:51.340
or maybe these books were written after long time

12:51.438 --> 12:54.915
after the prophet went away, Christ die in all that.

12:54.935 --> 12:58.451
So there are certain sacrifice you see.

13:14.516 --> 13:21.526
But it is a fact that, you whole have,
all of you have this power within you,

13:21.551 --> 13:26.150
this energy within you which we call as Kundalini.

13:35.988 --> 13:37.812
It has been proved now

13:37.851 --> 13:41.242
because wherever I have gone many countries

13:41.269 --> 13:46.232
various type of people were there
and they all got their realization.

13:55.814 --> 14:00.459
Especially in Turkey is a very dear country to me

14:00.494 --> 14:04.757
because of so many people who were here

14:04.789 --> 14:09.489
and  who  were  spiritually so equipped

14:09.638 --> 14:14.123
they might call themselves  as Sufis,
I mean Sufi means [UNCLEAR].

14:25.960 --> 14:30.840
So it cleanses, means this Kundalini rising

14:30.915 --> 14:35.710
cleanses you of your problems, of your enemies.

14:48.911 --> 14:51.331
Because it connects you

14:51.585 --> 14:55.550
to the all pervading power which we call as Ruh

14:55.621 --> 15:01.926
and all your personality absolutely
get absorbed with the truth.

15:17.977 --> 15:22.894
The first thing that happens to you when she rises,

15:22.963 --> 15:28.978
sometimes it is you just  become thoughtlessly aware.

15:40.396 --> 15:44.713
The thoughts come to us because we react.

15:44.973 --> 15:49.020
We see something immediately we react.

15:59.039 --> 16:06.094
We react according to our ego or maybe
according to our conditioning.

16:14.568 --> 16:19.822
But when the Kundalini she rises and
crosses this center upward

16:19.833 --> 16:22.563
then your thoughts stop.

16:35.547 --> 16:38.003
Then you become a witness.

16:38.051 --> 16:41.227
You witness without thinking.

16:50.245 --> 16:53.166
Thought  rises then falls

16:53.191 --> 16:57.027
then another thought comes up, rises and falls.

17:06.157 --> 17:09.746
There is a space, very little space in between

17:09.770 --> 17:12.393
but we cannot see that space,

17:12.426 --> 17:15.100
we can not in there  that space.

17:26.204 --> 17:32.000
Now these thoughts who are all the time [UNCLEAR]
hoovering  in your head

17:32.025 --> 17:34.962
and our  mind cruise or jumping on them

17:35.005 --> 17:38.292
doesn’t allow us to be in the present

17:38.317 --> 17:42.201
because they come from the past and from the future.

18:02.236 --> 18:06.521
So we cannot be in the present.

18:10.729 --> 18:15.539
Past is finished it does not exist
and the future is no more,

18:15.702 --> 18:20.537
so what we have to do is to stay in the present.

18:32.787 --> 18:36.554
And in the present is the reality, is the truth.

18:42.441 --> 18:45.538
That is how we can not enjoying.

18:50.617 --> 18:55.180
For example, I see a very beautiful carpet here,
very beautiful

18:55.220 --> 18:57.589
and I start reacting on it

18:57.622 --> 19:03.071
and then I start thinking of how much is that  cost,

19:03.177 --> 19:06.004
can I have it, all things is possible.

19:18.010 --> 19:20.557
but I can not watch it.

19:23.468 --> 19:25.507
Because I can not watch it

19:25.540 --> 19:30.193
the joy that  is put by the artist  in the sight
I can not enjoy it.

19:41.795 --> 19:43.965
So when this Kundalini rises

19:43.990 --> 19:50.124
what she does,  she elongates those toughts
there is a space   between a  thought.

20:01.159 --> 20:06.976
So we can see everything without thinking and enjoy fully.

20:17.178 --> 20:20.556
And with this enjoyment we get peace,

20:20.581 --> 20:22.591
complete peace.

20:31.545 --> 20:35.227
We do not agress others, we enjoy others.

20:44.468 --> 20:47.152
They have  many peace conferences

20:47.177 --> 20:51.273
but those who are having the conference have no peace within –

20:51.298 --> 20:54.196
then what is the use of having the conference?

21:05.702 --> 21:09.387
We have six enemies within us at least

21:09.460 --> 21:12.008
which are all the time torturing us.

21:20.366 --> 21:24.373
They are described in the Sanskrit language very beautifully

21:24.439 --> 21:26.806
but I will tell them, that's now [UNCLEAR].

21:36.940 --> 21:39.185
First is the anger.

21:41.996 --> 21:44.436
That is so common,

21:44.461 --> 21:47.478
comes out of  so much of conditioning

21:47.503 --> 21:49.830
may be so much of ego.

21:59.144 --> 22:01.415
Then the perversion,

22:01.447 --> 22:08.189
perversion of sex or
all kinds of dirty things people do it.

22:16.921 --> 22:19.921
Then we have false pride,

22:28.060 --> 22:30.527
now we have jealousy

22:32.413 --> 22:34.661
we have attachments.

22:38.414 --> 22:41.906
People are corrupt because
they are attached to their children,

22:41.961 --> 22:45.719
they want to make money for them,
so  they are corrupt.

22:58.532 --> 23:00.285
And we have  also attraction.

23:00.310 --> 23:04.239
We are attracted supposing somebody is attracted,

23:04.256 --> 23:09.291
say towards good clothes somebody attracted or good house

23:09.355 --> 23:11.467
attractions.

23:29.241 --> 23:31.368
We cannot explain.

23:31.433 --> 23:34.400
We cannot explain why we do that.

23:39.492 --> 23:43.423
Why we suffer from all these enemies we don't know.

23:49.022 --> 23:53.554
Once you become the spirit,

23:53.579 --> 23:57.080
spirit drops out everything,

23:57.093 --> 23:59.960
it is so clear, so clean,

23:59.985 --> 24:04.538
and  what is the spirit is the reflection of God in our heart.

24:20.623 --> 24:23.551
The spirit , that is within you.

24:23.576 --> 24:29.557
once it  enlightens you, you become such a wonderful person,

24:29.589 --> 24:34.502
such a nice person and you develop this spirituality.

24:47.525 --> 24:51.429
What, actually what happens is

24:51.456 --> 24:53.979
that when  Kundalini rises

24:54.006 --> 24:58.755
your spirit starts emitting vibrations

24:58.811 --> 25:03.503
spiritual vibrations on your central nervous system.

25:15.767 --> 25:21.284
And you start feeling cool breeze on your hands

25:21.366 --> 25:24.153
out of your fontanel bone area.

25:37.865 --> 25:42.336
And then this  fingers which represent

25:42.447 --> 25:47.249
the centers within you  starts speaking telling you
what's wrong and what's kind.

26:03.616 --> 26:09.031
Also they tell you about others,
what is wrong with the others.

26:18.220 --> 26:21.965
This connection with the divine
gives you this blessing

26:21.990 --> 26:25.633
that you  know what is wrong with you
and what is wrong with others.

26:40.112 --> 26:42.663
Even the doctors will not tell you,

26:42.710 --> 26:47.014
nobody can tell you, just now on your fingertips

26:57.925 --> 27:03.568
So in the Kuran it says at the time of kıyam
your hands will speak.

27:11.393 --> 27:15.345
So this is the kiyam time, kiyamat is different.

27:15.370 --> 27:17.594
[UNCLEAR]

27:17.635 --> 27:19.182
Kıyamat and kıyama

27:24.150 --> 27:28.705
Kyam because this is the last judgement.

27:33.436 --> 27:39.080
Those who do not accept their self realisation,

27:39.173 --> 27:45.825
and who don't get into the heavenly bliss of divinity,

27:45.906 --> 27:50.472
they go to hell – that is the wisdom.

28:00.888 --> 28:05.255
So, for you it is important that your hands must speak

28:05.280 --> 28:08.059
and tell you about you and others.

28:18.421 --> 28:22.058
That is how you are mussulman, otherwise you are not.

28:28.496 --> 28:31.220
If your hands do not speak

28:31.245 --> 28:34.311
than you are not a mussulman in surrendering.

28:41.527 --> 28:44.594
It`s all said, it is all written in the Quran

28:44.614 --> 28:49.417
but once you be  able to read it after
you have got your realization.

29:00.020 --> 29:03.020
It is high time that you should realize

29:03.052 --> 29:06.625
that we  have been following something so much

29:06.658 --> 29:09.111
and why is it we are in trouble,

29:09.151 --> 29:14.230
why we have not been able to achieve whatever is promised.

29:27.641 --> 29:31.179
It is something missing

29:31.212 --> 29:34.858
that so far we have not been able to

29:34.890 --> 29:37.352
achieve what is doing promised.

30:01.816 --> 30:05.197
You all can have your self realization.

30:09.054 --> 30:13.403
Don’t have any fear about it and some

30:13.444 --> 30:16.382
sort of funny ideas about it.

30:23.867 --> 30:28.215
Because whatever will happen, you will feel it.

30:34.872 --> 30:37.324
It`s not something imaginary.

30:41.709 --> 30:43.812
It’s the actualization.

30:47.706 --> 30:52.105
To the Christians I say this actualization of  baptism.

31:01.110 --> 31:05.713
So, it's your chance now all of you so many have  come

31:05.785 --> 31:08.158
to have that self realization.

31:17.742 --> 31:21.805
It was prophesied that it will happen collectively.

31:28.073 --> 31:30.461
And so, you all deserve it.

31:30.486 --> 31:32.152
And you should have it.

31:32.191 --> 31:35.214
Because İt is what  is promised.

31:43.985 --> 31:46.325
So ultimately what happens

31:46.350 --> 31:49.320
that you jump in the ocean of joy.

31:55.842 --> 31:58.739
You become powerfull.

32:01.880 --> 32:03.736
But you don't have ego.

32:05.856 --> 32:10.454
And you know how you get help others

32:10.487 --> 32:13.740
and yourself and help the family.

32:22.693 --> 32:24.494
All of you can get  it.

32:28.215 --> 32:34.741
I mean those who want can all get it ,
it can't be forced [UNCLEAR].

32:42.813 --> 32:49.943
Thus you will know what you are and also what othes are.

32:58.485 --> 33:02.119
Many people have  been cured in sahaja yoga, no doubt.

33:02.207 --> 33:05.262
We also have a hospital in India.

33:15.503 --> 33:20.844
Where people are cured without any medicine
with their own vibrations.

33:30.403 --> 33:35.879
Moreover mentally there are so many people
who have been cured.

33:43.192 --> 33:45.725
And your problems are solved.

33:45.750 --> 33:50.352
Because you get out  of your problems.

33:57.771 --> 34:03.842
Will be amazed how miraculously
you achieve such small small things

34:03.867 --> 34:06.901
which really look great [UNCLEAR] to begin with.

34:17.011 --> 34:21.828
Every human being has a right  to get self realization.

34:27.469 --> 34:33.080
All negative forces and energies  just
drop out and run away.

34:41.235 --> 34:46.520
Just like whether light comes in all darkness goes away.

34:52.557 --> 34:54.843
It sometimes  people don't believe.

34:54.868 --> 34:59.585
Because, they don't think they are
capable of getting self realization.

35:10.165 --> 35:14.633
But, I am sure tonight you will learn what you are.

35:21.454 --> 35:26.501
Will be absolutely relaxed person and

35:26.533 --> 35:31.453
the whole being  will be filled with joy and divine love.

35:42.200 --> 35:46.525
It's not because of me, it's because of you.

35:51.604 --> 36:00.408
You have once you have what only
I have to open the window here.

36:07.822 --> 36:11.211
That to you do because It is your desire,

36:11.251 --> 36:15.046
to become your pure desire to be.

36:24.048 --> 36:27.460
Otherwise no other desire is pure.

36:32.527 --> 36:39.177
All economics is based on one point
that no human desire is complete.

36:49.761 --> 36:54.443
Today you want  to have one thing then
you want to have another thing.

36:59.604 --> 37:03.286
And you are never satisfied.

37:06.710 --> 37:09.059
But this  is pure desire.

37:09.324 --> 37:15.126
Kundalini is the energy of pure desire
because the desire of our Almighty

37:23.654 --> 37:27.466
So, when you get your realization,

37:27.526 --> 37:33.319
you feel absolutely satisfied and
enjoy whatever you have.

37:43.888 --> 37:48.484
And also you enjoy others and their things

37:48.708 --> 37:52.700
without thinking that they don't belong to you.

38:06.276 --> 38:08.887
The whole panorama changes

38:08.895 --> 38:14.950
and you become a very universal personality.

38:22.364 --> 38:25.110
You really become global

38:25.198 --> 38:30.547
and everybody who is in sahaja yoga are such great friends.

38:41.552 --> 38:49.389
I'll give an example that
Palestinians were fighting Israelis

38:49.542 --> 38:54.211
and one of the Israeli fellow, telephoned  to me

38:54.272 --> 39:01.518
that Mother we have some Sahaja Yogis
in  the  one of the villages of  Palestine.

39:14.235 --> 39:19.804
They were friends,  despite the fact that
[UNCLEAR] is fighting, countries were fighting.

39:19.845 --> 39:23.548
But they were Sahaja Yogis,
so they were friends they are friends.

39:38.522 --> 39:44.730
So this Israilian knew that
they are going to drop a big bomb

39:44.794 --> 39:49.376
in a particular village and he told me that
please pay  attention Mother

39:49.417 --> 39:52.094
I don't want  people to be killed  there.

40:06.078 --> 40:11.284
I give pay attention and they never drop the bomb.

40:16.948 --> 40:21.122
Love is the most powerful thing human beings have all.

40:27.335 --> 40:29.763
We have never used it.

40:29.888 --> 40:35.034
We have always use hatred to over power others.

40:42.998 --> 40:46.775
We have never used love.

40:50.452 --> 40:56.191
There is divine love allover  allover the world
that's why we are existing .

41:02.663 --> 41:06.408
You have to just become one within that's all.

41:12.512 --> 41:16.972
It's allover, it is called Ruh , It's allover.

41:16.997 --> 41:19.450
But we have not yet felt.

41:27.419 --> 41:31.879
But today is now, you have the time to feel it.

41:37.631 --> 41:41.099
For that you don’t have to concentrate or do anything,

41:41.132 --> 41:43.639
it will  just work automatically.

41:53.644 --> 41:56.381
Have faith in yourself.

41:59.007 --> 42:01.769
Do not condemn yourself.

42:06.992 --> 42:09.341
This will change the whole world.

42:09.420 --> 42:13.594
Once they realize that there is divine love
which [UNCLEAR] us.

42:25.616 --> 42:29.290
So, the first state is thoughtless awareness

42:29.323 --> 42:36.787
and the second state  is what we called
as the doubtless awareness.

42:52.351 --> 42:55.818
That state comes to people automatically

42:55.827 --> 43:00.196
sometimes together and they have no doubts about it.

43:09.558 --> 43:11.645
It works that way.

43:11.670 --> 43:17.338
It doesn't give you any doubts anymore
you are sure this is what it is.

43:28.671 --> 43:31.179
Today somebody came to see me

43:31.220 --> 43:33.698
he used to perspire and hot.

43:33.723 --> 43:37.783
And I saw him, he had  problem with his heart,

43:37.808 --> 43:40.418
to  look working very hard.

43:54.300 --> 43:57.723
I raised his Kundalini,  he got his realization

43:57.748 --> 43:59.549
his perspiration stopped.

44:08.911 --> 44:14.037
So I told him that you should forgive,

44:14.046 --> 44:17.700
forgive others and that worked.

44:25.950 --> 44:31.378
And this young fellow would have been very seriously ill

44:31.403 --> 44:34.948
or dead by that kind of a  heart.

44:45.011 --> 44:49.807
So you get an awareness which is doubtless.

45:00.060 --> 45:04.926
So all those who want to have their self realization

45:04.951 --> 45:06.125
please stay on.

45:06.150 --> 45:09.157
If you don't want to have
should live the hall.

45:19.392 --> 45:25.121
One thing, you should not, you cannot pay for spirituality.

45:30.040 --> 45:34.842
There are many false people
who are doing all  kinds of nonsense,

45:34.891 --> 45:38.640
only thing is you must take  to your self realization.

45:51.084 --> 45:54.195
So that you all become Sufis.

45:58.037 --> 46:00.362
You don't have to give up everything.

46:00.387 --> 46:03.872
Or you don’t have to become an ascetic,

46:10.652 --> 46:12.702
and I am a married  woman,

46:12.751 --> 46:17.420
I have for  children, I have for  grandchildren
and I have got  their grandchildren .

46:24.292 --> 46:28.682
But I am what I am.

46:32.468 --> 46:35.110
That’s what should happen to you.

46:39.810 --> 46:41.722
So again I would request

46:41.747 --> 46:46.003
those who don’t want have  their
self realization to  leave the hall.

46:50.041 --> 46:53.556
Like this, like this, just like this. Yes.

46:58.978 --> 47:01.303
Now  close your eyes.

47:03.460 --> 47:05.062
Please close.

47:10.213 --> 47:14.913
See If you are feeling cool breeze on your fingertips

47:36.972 --> 47:40.941
Now please open your eyes,

47:40.959 --> 47:42.834
put your left hand towards me

47:42.850 --> 47:45.707
and put the right hand

47:45.757 --> 47:52.167
bend your head and put the right hand
against the fontenella bone area

47:52.183 --> 47:55.050
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

48:09.751 --> 48:13.136
See if you this coming  on the left hand,

48:16.423 --> 48:20.687
little it should be above the head not on  top,

48:24.079 --> 48:26.239
bend your head and see for yourself.

48:26.479 --> 48:28.472
Move your hand and see for yourself.

48:39.057 --> 48:41.987
Now please put your right hand towards me,

48:44.674 --> 48:47.190
not touching the head above

48:47.375 --> 48:49.835
left hand on the top of your head.

48:49.933 --> 48:56.875
All those who have felt cool or
hot breeze on their fingertips

48:56.877 --> 49:01.668
or in the palm or upper to fontanel bone area,

49:01.708 --> 49:04.120
