00:08.160 --> 00:11.680
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

00:12.400 --> 00:14.480
They had planned everything.

00:14.600 --> 00:18.960
They had all the arrangements made

00:19.080 --> 00:21.640
and the sari was missing.

00:21.760 --> 00:27.480
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

00:27.600 --> 00:29.240
so now what to do?

00:29.360 --> 00:33.600
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

00:33.720 --> 00:36.800
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

00:36.920 --> 00:39.160
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

00:39.280 --> 00:42.120
otherwise we can have it later.

00:42.280 --> 00:46.200
But I was least disturbed,

00:46.760 --> 00:49.320
least upset.

00:49.440 --> 00:53.800
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.400
But if you have a mental conception,

00:57.520 --> 01:00.560
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

01:00.720 --> 01:03.800
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

01:03.920 --> 01:09.720
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

01:12.920 --> 01:14.880
But that is what we cannot do.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.880
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

01:18.000 --> 01:20.680
This is what it is.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.440
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

01:27.560 --> 01:29.880
That’s one of the things.

01:30.120 --> 01:33.720
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

01:33.840 --> 01:39.360
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

01:39.960 --> 01:42.960
because we make a mental projection.

01:43.080 --> 01:45.360
Mentally we calculate something.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.680
This has to be.

01:46.800 --> 01:52.200
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

01:52.480 --> 01:58.840
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

01:58.960 --> 02:01.560
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

02:01.680 --> 02:06.400
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

02:06.520 --> 02:08.520
only about two o’clock.

02:08.640 --> 02:13.720
He said, “Why not in the morning?” “I don’t think it will be feasible.”

02:15.960 --> 02:20.120
So this is how you become avyagra.

02:20.240 --> 02:24.680
Vyagra means person who is worried.

02:24.800 --> 02:28.080
The one who is not worried.

02:28.200 --> 02:30.640
So we worry because of two things.

02:30.760 --> 02:38.760
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

02:41.440 --> 02:43.680
Future doesn’t exist.

02:43.800 --> 02:47.080
If you have made up your mind that this should happen in the future,

02:47.200 --> 02:50.840
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.440
But you have not made any mental picture,

02:54.560 --> 02:56.760
you will see what comes on the scene.

02:56.880 --> 03:01.480
You’ll watch whatever appears.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.280
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

03:04.360 --> 03:06.920
what’s going to happen.

03:07.040 --> 03:12.520
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

03:12.640 --> 03:16.240
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

03:16.360 --> 03:23.320
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

03:23.480 --> 03:25.560
and we are not having it.”

03:25.680 --> 03:27.360
So you are upset.

03:27.480 --> 03:31.240
What difference does it make?

03:31.360 --> 03:36.600
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

03:36.720 --> 03:38.880
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

03:39.000 --> 03:43.560
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

03:43.720 --> 03:45.880
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

03:46.000 --> 03:50.200
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

03:51.800 --> 03:54.840
We really decorated ourselves well.

03:54.960 --> 03:56.640
We were all ready for the puja,

03:56.760 --> 03:58.400
we were sitting here for the puja,

03:58.520 --> 04:01.920
and now what has happened!

04:04.040 --> 04:08.520
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

04:09.120 --> 04:12.320
I knew what was coming.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.120
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.000
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

04:26.120 --> 04:27.760
I’m busy with Myself.

04:27.880 --> 04:33.200
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

04:36.120 --> 04:41.920
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

04:42.280 --> 04:45.920
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.200
In India people come.

04:48.320 --> 04:51.360
They keep so much money for buying things.

04:51.480 --> 04:55.200
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

04:55.400 --> 04:57.240
what you call traders.

04:57.360 --> 04:59.280
The customs are so kind, I mean

04:59.400 --> 05:01.480
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

05:01.600 --> 05:03.920
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

05:04.040 --> 05:05.920
And then they have a mental picture,

05:06.040 --> 05:10.640
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

05:11.280 --> 05:13.480
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

05:13.600 --> 05:17.760
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

05:17.960 --> 05:20.600
So then they might go to spend some money.

05:20.720 --> 05:24.440
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

05:25.000 --> 05:29.120
It has happened with all of you.

05:29.240 --> 05:30.960
So they go and buy something.

05:31.080 --> 05:34.960
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

05:35.080 --> 05:38.480
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

05:38.600 --> 05:41.680
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.600
How many pounds you paid for that?

05:43.720 --> 05:45.560
Gavin: Forty pounds.

05:45.680 --> 05:49.640
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

05:49.760 --> 05:53.280
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

05:54.640 --> 05:57.440
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

05:57.560 --> 06:00.040
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

06:00.160 --> 06:03.280
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

06:03.400 --> 06:07.680
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

06:07.800 --> 06:10.400
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

06:10.520 --> 06:12.840
They thought they’ve bought something great.

06:12.960 --> 06:16.080
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.040
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

06:18.160 --> 06:20.480
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.360
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

06:23.480 --> 06:27.920
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

06:31.040 --> 06:33.440
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

06:33.560 --> 06:36.800
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

06:36.920 --> 06:40.200
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.400
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

06:42.520 --> 06:44.840
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

06:44.960 --> 06:47.960
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

06:48.080 --> 06:50.920
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

06:51.040 --> 06:55.240
He said, “What is the price?” I said, “Forty pounds.”

06:56.120 --> 06:59.320
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

06:59.440 --> 07:01.960
And he bought it for forty pounds.

07:02.080 --> 07:04.480
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

07:04.600 --> 07:08.240
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

07:10.200 --> 07:13.920
And I found it out that,

07:14.040 --> 07:18.880
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

07:19.240 --> 07:23.600
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

07:23.720 --> 07:28.840
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

07:28.960 --> 07:31.560
And if you start making it flexible then

07:31.680 --> 07:35.160
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

07:35.280 --> 07:37.760
very early. Now he’s different.

07:37.880 --> 07:40.840
So if you become flexible,

07:40.960 --> 07:44.720
then what happens you see the joy of it.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.400
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

07:48.520 --> 07:51.720
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

07:51.840 --> 07:54.560
And you can never enjoy it,

07:54.680 --> 07:59.600
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

07:59.760 --> 08:02.000
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

08:02.120 --> 08:04.840
You see it is all your own creation.

08:04.960 --> 08:08.880
The mental projection is your creation,

08:09.000 --> 08:14.840
and also the destruction is your creation.

08:15.400 --> 08:19.480
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.920
But who does that is Mahamaya,

08:24.040 --> 08:27.840
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

08:27.960 --> 08:32.080
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

08:32.200 --> 08:34.080
I have to go to Birmingham.

08:34.200 --> 08:39.520
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

08:39.640 --> 08:44.320
After some time you will find that it’s impossible to do something,

08:44.440 --> 08:47.840
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

08:47.960 --> 08:50.400
Because whenever you will try to do something,

08:50.560 --> 08:54.520
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

08:54.640 --> 08:58.400
If not, then it will make you realize

08:58.520 --> 09:01.640
what is important, what you’ve missed.

09:02.840 --> 09:07.120
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

09:07.240 --> 09:10.400
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

09:10.520 --> 09:13.640
What to do? Now where to go?”

09:16.720 --> 09:19.840
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.240
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

09:22.360 --> 09:25.800
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

09:25.920 --> 09:31.880
for days together. I just see that there.

09:34.920 --> 09:43.360
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

09:44.920 --> 09:48.120
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

09:48.240 --> 09:50.680
at any cost.

09:51.400 --> 09:56.560
Then that acts as a guide

09:57.080 --> 10:03.120
and you understand the flexibility

10:03.240 --> 10:07.120
of all these worldly, transitory things.

10:08.160 --> 10:10.120
They are all changeable,

10:10.240 --> 10:14.880
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.
