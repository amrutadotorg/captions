00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.680
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.480
They had planned everything.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.960
They had all the arrangements made

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.640
and the sari was missing.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.480
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.240
so now what to do?

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.600
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.800
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.160
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.120
otherwise we can have it later.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.200
But I was least disturbed,

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.320
least upset.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.800
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.400
But if you have a mental conception,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.560
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.800
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.720
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.880
But that is what we cannot do.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.880
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.680
This is what it is.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.440
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.880
That’s one of the things.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:33.720
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.360
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.960
because we make a mental projection.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.360
Mentally we calculate something.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.680
This has to be.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.200
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.840
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.560
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.400
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.520
only about two o’clock.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.720
He said, “Why not in the morning?” “I don’t think it will be feasible.”

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.120
So this is how you become avyagra.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.680
Vyagra means person who is worried.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.080
The one who is not worried.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.640
So we worry because of two things.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.760
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.680
Future doesn’t exist.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.080
If you have made up your mind that this should happen in the future,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.840
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.440
But you have not made any mental picture,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.760
you will see what comes on the scene.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:01.480
You’ll watch whatever appears.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.280
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.920
what’s going to happen.

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.520
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.240
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:23.320
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.560
and we are not having it.”

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.360
So you are upset.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.240
What difference does it make?

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.600
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.880
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.560
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.880
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.200
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.840
We really decorated ourselves well.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.640
We were all ready for the puja,

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.400
we were sitting here for the puja,

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.920
and now what has happened!

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.520
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.320
I knew what was coming.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.120
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.000
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.760
I’m busy with Myself.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.200
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:41.920
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:45.920
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.200
In India people come.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.360
They keep so much money for buying things.

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.200
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.240
what you call traders.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.280
The customs are so kind, I mean

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.480
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.920
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.920
And then they have a mental picture,

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:10.640
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.480
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.760
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.600
So then they might go to spend some money.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.440
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.120
It has happened with all of you.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.960
So they go and buy something.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:34.960
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.480
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.680
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.600
How many pounds you paid for that?

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.560
Gavin: Forty pounds.

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.640
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:53.280
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:57.440
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.040
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.280
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.680
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.400
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.840
They thought they’ve bought something great.

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:16.080
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.040
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.480
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.360
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.920
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.440
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.800
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.200
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.400
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:44.840
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.960
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.920
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.240
He said, “What is the price?” I said, “Forty pounds.”

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.320
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.960
And he bought it for forty pounds.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.480
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:08.240
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:13.920
And I found it out that,

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:18.880
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:23.600
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.840
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.560
And if you start making it flexible then

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.160
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.760
very early. Now he’s different.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:40.840
So if you become flexible,

00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.720
then what happens you see the joy of it.

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:48.400
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.720
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.560
And you can never enjoy it,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:59.600
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.000
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:04.840
You see it is all your own creation.

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.880
The mental projection is your creation,

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:14.840
and also the destruction is your creation.

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:19.480
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:23.920
But who does that is Mahamaya,

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.840
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.080
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.080
I have to go to Birmingham.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:39.520
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.320
After some time you will find that it’s impossible to do something,

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.840
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:50.400
Because whenever you will try to do something,

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:54.520
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:58.400
If not, then it will make you realize

00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:01.640
what is important, what you’ve missed.

00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:07.120
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:10.400
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.640
What to do? Now where to go?”

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.840
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.240
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:25.800
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:31.880
for days together. I just see that there.

00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:43.360
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.120
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.680
at any cost.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.560
Then that acts as a guide

00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:03.120
and you understand the flexibility

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.120
of all these worldly, transitory things.

00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:10.120
They are all changeable,

00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:14.880
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.
