00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.560
These mixtures, now think of it.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.590
This is only because I have given you birth.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.990
Nobody could have done before this, I tell you.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.110
You can cure others; you can
give speeches on Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.090
You can know your own problems;
you can cure your own parents.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.510
You can cure your own surroundings.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:33.030
You can clean yourself and others.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.240
Only with Realization it starts.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.220
It’s all in a bundle.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.760
What a jump it is from the first awareness
where it was just a desire and here you started.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:55.140
But all these things that were looking quite
funny in the first one when you had desire,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.380
form a very subtler beautiful
forms and they come into you.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:08.850
At this time, you do feel
your chakras, their problems.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.580
You start again analysing them.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.460
The biggest problem in the
West is they start analysing.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.725
You give them a cake, they’ll analyse it.

00:01:16.725 --> 00:01:20.220
Give them anything, they’ll analyse it.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.120
Analysis they think is the
biggest thing and that’s how

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.160
this analysis business is so maddening for them.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.340
Here it is they’re clinging
on to their Realization,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.780
the other side is everything analysing.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.830
You see, the legs are analyzed, feet
are analysed, nails are analysed,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.560
then they’re taken in the microscope and seen to.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.770
Here the legs are to be used for climbing up,
and here you’re analysing the legs and the feet.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:02:00.000
See, the whole purpose is lost when you start
identifying with whatever was hanging on to you.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.185
So now you should say, “Now finished,
done! Now I’m another person."

00:02:07.185 --> 00:02:12.780
The greatest thing is, in this awareness
of yours when you are realized,

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.140
you must accept that, that person who
was there is dead and finished and gone.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.900
“I’m a different person."

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.620
Even that acceptance, people find it
difficult because shri Ego is there.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.140
It doesn’t allow you.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.800
It says, “Oh God, how can that be?

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.780
I mean to say that ‘I’m absolutely
transformed.’ ” You are transformed absolutely.

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:50.490
Can you imagine you can give
Realization to people! You

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.716
tell somebody, they’ll say, “Oh, I know this."

00:02:53.716 --> 00:03:01.140
They’ll all run away! Nobody will believe.

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.970
But you know you can give Realization.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.890
Nobody will believe.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.180
That Mahajan Yogi who gave you
Realization, first he said,

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:16.290
“Mother, how can it be?” He couldn’t
believe that he could give Realization.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:21.825
Poor fellow has been working as a ‘yogi’ for so
many years, he couldn’t believe it to begin with.

00:03:21.825 --> 00:03:23.760
Same fellow who has given Realization.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:36.090
Even if, I mean to believe that you can
give Realization, it takes time for people.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:41.010
They cannot believe it.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.430
So, what have you to do about becoming?

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.750
That is to at least believe – yes,
you are giving Realization after all.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:03.490
You see it like a white cloth before you,
still you say it is black Hurst Blue! So,

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.180
these dealings with these
‘Hurst Blues’ is the worst case.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.980
You are giving Realization.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:19.180
See now, Ian, who is supposed to be going to a
psychiatrist, he can give Realization to that

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:25.840
psychiatrist! The doctor who is going
to treat you, can give him Realization.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.640
Believe it, you can.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.640
But when he says this to him, he thinks, “Oh, he’s

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.000
one of these!” But at least
you believe into yourself.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.460
This is the place where you must have faith,

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:47.740
this faith that you have got
Realization through Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:56.320
That it’s a tremendous power, and that there is
All-Pervading Power which is absolutely dynamic,

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.850
and that you have that power flowing through you,

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:05.680
and that you are giving Realization, and
that’s your Mother is something special.

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:16.140
Faith, not faith because I’m saying
because it’s blind, but you have seen it.

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.430
But this is what it is! When you see it, also
you don’t believe it, then what should I call it?

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.340
You know for definite that this is happening but
you don’t believe into it then what should I say?

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.550
If you believe that it is so, that is faith.

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.360
Imagine, faith means blindness.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:42.060
It’s opening your eyes much more to
what it is and accepting that it is so.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:48.930
And then the faith must grow.

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:57.390
At this stage, is the power of faith that
helps you, nothing but power of faith.

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:04.290
And power of faith is the greatest
becoming power, I should say,

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:13.500
because then you realize that whatever
you had known so far has been of no value.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.060
This is something so great and
so gigantic and so dynamic.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.990
It is something so much out of the
blue which you have never known before,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:36.910
that you get really bewildered
and then you start having faith.

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.650
Now, then, when I say that you just put your hands

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:48.820
like this and put a bandhan
– it works, it does work.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:56.830
Then also you start seeing that when Mother
does like this just to herself, we all feel it.

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:11.440
When she blows on her hand then we
start feeling it that we are in her and

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.670
she is in us – and that we are aware of her
wholesomeness and she is our wholesomeness.

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.080
Then the faith starts growing.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.040
You cannot analyse it because this
is beyond analysis, beyond thought.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.670
So, the surrendering starts.

00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:33.220
If you analyse now, you cannot.

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.980
You cannot analyse it anymore.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.180
Only dead things you can
analyse, living you cannot.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:41.710
And this is beyond living.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:46.000
The thing that gives life to
living – this is what it is.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.400
So, you cannot analyse it.

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.470
So, you start surrendering.

00:07:50.470 --> 00:08:03.340
When you start surrendering and the faith comes
in then your awareness rises higher than this.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:11.170
And these small, small, little, little things
which have become subtler, they start departing.

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:24.210
This is the third state where your trigunas
you can see, but they do not affect you.

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:29.550
So, in the first state you have desire.

00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:32.370
In the second state, which is a very big thing,

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:41.370
you see the desire being fulfilled but
all these subtle things are mixed up.

00:08:41.370 --> 00:08:50.820
In the third state you see them, third
stage, but they do not affect you.

00:08:50.820 --> 00:09:00.810
This is the third stage when one has
to see that they do not affect you.

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:09.746
You do see catching, but then you do not
call ‘catching’, you say ‘recording’.

00:09:09.746 --> 00:09:10.470
You think you are an instrument,
you are just recording.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:19.830
The effect of that becomes very small, very small.

00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:28.976
You become so powerful within that the
effect of this catching is very little.

00:09:28.976 --> 00:09:32.700
You just record as an effect.

00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:40.890
This is the third state of your
ascent aside yes keep it for a

00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:42.790
while, doesn’t matter, keep it with you.

00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:43.750
It’s alright.

00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:47.020
It’s alright keep it.
Now this, at this third state.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:52.420
To rise up to this third state,
the only way is complete faith.

00:09:52.420 --> 00:10:04.810
Faith is, first of all you have to learn certain
things about faith: one of them is the protocol.

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:15.130
But with faith, if you learn protocol,
then you will not feel bad about it.

00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:21.490
But if you are forced onto it, you’ll feel bad.

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.200
You see, the mixture state is still on.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:30.760
So to develop faith you have to first of all

00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:43.050
tell yourself rationally, clearly,
“Don’t you see this is happening?

00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:43.890
Can’t you see this?

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.380
Can’t you see it is rising?

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:50.190
Can’t you understand?” Tell yourself.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:54.660
Isn’t it dynamic.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:59.940
Just sit down, think how
wonderful it is, how great it is.

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:09.810
Just talk to the trees, talk to the ocean,
talk to flowers, talk to these walls,

00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:17.430
they are better than many human beings! And
tell them, “Don’t you think so?” Go in the

00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:25.110
museum and tell all the statues, “I’ve
found it, I’ve got it!” Tell yourself.

00:11:25.110 --> 00:11:27.930
You see, telling yourself,
you’ll develop this faith.

00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:30.240
There’s no way out.

00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:32.730
Many people have asked me this question:

00:11:32.730 --> 00:11:37.620
“How to develop the faith?”
Now, it is such a absurd thing.

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:43.170
Here you are moving the Kundalini, you are
giving Realization and turn round and ask,

00:11:43.170 --> 00:11:57.720
“Mother, how do we develop faith?” It is beyond me
to understand that…I mean, what is happening here?

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.830
Now what are you doing?

00:12:04.140 --> 00:12:12.180
This faith then starts encompassing
also what I say: means absorbing,

00:12:12.180 --> 00:12:19.530
not criticizing, not repelling
back, but absorbing it.

00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:24.480
This absorption can be hindered
by many other ways also.

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:28.410
Absorption is the only way you grow.

00:12:28.410 --> 00:12:32.175
How does a tree grow?

00:12:32.175 --> 00:12:34.800
By absorption.

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:39.300
What is the mouth of absorption?

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:40.680
Is Nirvichara.

00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.230
What is Nirvichara?

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:46.620
Where you do not think about it.

00:12:46.620 --> 00:12:55.415
Now when I say you are not to think, at a
lower stage, people will say, “Oh, you know,

00:12:55.415 --> 00:13:02.730
she’s very dominating, she’s very dominating,
I must say!” This is the idea will come in.

00:13:02.730 --> 00:13:08.430
But absorption is only possible
when you have the faith.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:12.390
And the whole thing goes into you.

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:14.880
You just go on sucking it like a child.

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.400
The whole thing goes into.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:23.070
Just like a lake which is without any ripple,

00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:26.880
it reflects the complete,
entire creation in it, complete.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:33.960
If there are ripples, then there’s
diffusion, there’s confusion.

00:13:36.170 --> 00:13:46.880
So this is the stage of faith which
starts from the second to go to the third.

00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:52.280
For example now, we’ll take a
simple case of my photograph.

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.840
There were no photographs before.

00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:06.650
Only in My lifetime the photographs
have started, for your information.

00:14:06.650 --> 00:14:10.399
This photography also you have
developed yourself on your own.

00:14:10.399 --> 00:14:10.490
Of course, with the help of the Holy Ghost,
no doubt, of course, that goes without saying.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:17.120
But, you have developed it.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:22.520
I myself did not know that, that this
photograph will catch me so much.

00:14:22.520 --> 00:14:25.070
I did not know myself.

00:14:25.070 --> 00:14:33.350
You’ll be amazed, that I started
seeing that these photographs are

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:41.660
more powerful than a statue which is
made according to what I was before.

00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:45.050
Because this is the present thing.

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:49.100
This is how I’m existing.

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:59.270
I was amazed myself that it is emitting vibrations
and light, and that my photograph can act so well.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:06.320
You see the main problem was that,
how to approach so many people?

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:12.230
You can have, say, hundred Sahaja
Yogis, you can have two hundred,

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:15.635
you can have at the most two thousand.

00:15:15.635 --> 00:15:19.700
You see for these thugs it is very
easy – you just have a registration,

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:20.600
you fill the money and you’re there.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:28.640
But Sahaja Yoga is becoming,
is awakening and Realization.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:31.295
How is it going to work out?

00:15:31.295 --> 00:15:33.080
It was a very big problem for me.

00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.880
It’s not that I can just give you a book
and just sit and read it and say that,

00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.320
“Yes, I have got it, I have become."

00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:46.400
It’s real becoming, ripening,
maturing, living process.

00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:48.335
Now how am I to do it?

00:15:48.335 --> 00:15:52.250
And here is the answer – is a photograph.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:56.840
Then your TV, that’s also modern.

00:15:56.840 --> 00:16:01.550
Of course, the TV people have not
allowed me to go on the screen,

00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:04.730
so far, but I’ve gone on the screen in India.

00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:09.620
Only in Poona, not here – rather difficult.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:16.220
First, let them have all the thugs,
then I’ll go, that always has been.

00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:26.330
So this is what it is, that all your
Medias can be used through my photograph.

00:16:26.330 --> 00:16:30.770
What a blessing it is! And the photograph,

00:16:30.770 --> 00:16:35.720
if you think, is representing Me, I
think you are not expressing it fully.

00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:45.740
I was amazed that my photographs are much more
powerful than any statues put together – even

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:56.160
produced by Mother Earth! Because
photograph has got so many elements in it.

00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.070
For example, you see, it has got light element,

00:17:02.070 --> 00:17:12.780
it has got water element, it has got earth
element, it has got also air element.

00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:17.550
If the air is not all right,
you cannot get a photograph.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:24.840
And also it has got the ether element.

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:34.600
With all these five elements,
you cannot produce a statue.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:43.750
Ether element it has got because if you have a

00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:44.559
photograph here, you can transcend it to any
other place you can – what do you call that?

00:17:44.559 --> 00:17:44.620
– transmit it to any place.
Photograph can be transmitted.

00:17:44.620 --> 00:18:02.080
But you cannot transmit the statue as it is
anywhere, only the photograph of a statue you can.

00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.260
So it has also got ether element.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:14.140
So photograph is much more
powerful than any other statue.

00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:25.930
Moreover, it is a reproduction, no doubt, but
reproduction of reality, with five elements.

00:18:25.930 --> 00:18:33.850
So I shouldn’t call it just a
representative, it’s quite me.

00:18:33.850 --> 00:18:36.910
Because my attention is there.

00:18:36.910 --> 00:18:41.980
We have experimented with this.

00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:50.087
The Sharayu Gadkary had a photograph of
mine and her relation came to her and she

00:18:50.087 --> 00:18:52.420
used to mock at the photograph
and say all kinds of things.

00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:58.150
She brought the photograph to me showing
that it had become all dark, black.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:05.260
So I said, “Who was there?” She said, “It’s my,

00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:07.720
some relation who had come
she used to do like this.

00:19:07.720 --> 00:19:08.560
It has become black."

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.405
I said, “You’d better put it in the sea now.

00:19:10.405 --> 00:19:11.710
My attention is not there, no vibrations.

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:17.500
My attention has come away,
receded from there, I can see that.

00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:20.260
You should not have put the photograph like that."

00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:31.480
So there’s a very big difference between a statue
and a photograph, because my attention is there.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:40.810
Of course, even the statues which are, I mean the
ones which are Swayambhu, which are created by

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:56.140
Mother Earth, also has vibrations and they also
show that they have vibrations, but they cannot

00:19:56.140 --> 00:20:08.770
give you awakening of the Kundalini, because
My photograph has got My desire, also, in it.

00:20:08.770 --> 00:20:13.570
They cannot.

00:20:13.570 --> 00:20:15.460
If they could have, Stonehenge would have.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:26.170
If you go to these statues, and if I am
standing there, they emit no vibrations.

00:20:26.170 --> 00:20:29.470
Only you have to put one hand
towards me and towards them,

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.180
then they start emitting and then it starts.

00:20:31.180 --> 00:20:33.160
But you have to accept my permission.

00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:39.190
Even the statue you have got of Ganesha,
now it’s all right, but in the beginning,

00:20:39.190 --> 00:20:42.340
it never used to give vibrations
till it was worked out this way.

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:46.660
But they do not lack authority.

00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:58.150
So the protocol of these photographs also
is important to start developing that faith.

00:20:58.150 --> 00:21:03.880
You should keep one photograph with
you all the time in your pocket.

00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:12.320
Respect it.
As many as possible, respect them.

00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:16.250
Not for decoration, but to be respected.

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:17.840
In the morning you see the photograph.

00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:20.030
Now I’m telling you because of faith problem.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:22.400
I have to tell it myself, the whole thing,

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.310
that’s the worst part of this Incarnation
is! Because other things you have done,

00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:34.070
for example, those who follow Christ, they
will have His photograph in the morning.

00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:36.699
Especially if they are Hindus, then
they’ll touch the feet morning time,

00:21:36.699 --> 00:21:36.770
evening time, before singing, going
out, coming in, they’ll do that.

00:21:36.770 --> 00:21:49.760
In the same way, when you have
a photograph, you work on that

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.670
with that understanding, “It’s Mother’s with us."

00:21:58.990 --> 00:22:01.210
You’ll be amazed how things work out.

00:22:01.210 --> 00:22:05.650
One of My nephews, Sarvesh, you know him.

00:22:05.650 --> 00:22:12.700
He is a great believer of Mother, that’s me,
and he always carries a photograph with him.

00:22:12.700 --> 00:22:23.890
He lost his diamond ring in our train
here in London and he came back.

00:22:23.890 --> 00:22:29.110
He said, “I know I’ll get it back because I had
your photograph in my thing, it cannot be lost."

00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:32.230
And he found it.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:38.020
Somebody deposited it in the police
station and he found it, he got it.

00:22:38.020 --> 00:22:49.720
The credit goes to the honesty of
British people, doesn’t matter.

00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:57.040
But what I’m saying, that that’s how you
have to develop your faith and that love.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:15.290
Faith will help you, to just act
as ointment on all these catches.

00:23:15.290 --> 00:23:18.380
You won’t be such a person all
the time going like this “Oh,

00:23:18.380 --> 00:23:24.140
I’m catching, oooh, weeeaa, ooooh,
weeeaa” You’ll be just seeing, you see,

00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:34.030
like an elephant walking and all the
dogs barking at it, it just goes on.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:35.140
It’s like that.

00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:44.410
So the third awareness comes in where
you start seeing all these, recording it.

00:23:49.890 --> 00:23:51.390
This is the third state.

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.700
Then the fourth state comes in.

00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:04.250
In the fourth state, is called as
the Turya Dasha, is the fourth state.

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:10.884
Yogi: Can you repeat that Mother?

00:24:10.884 --> 00:24:10.927
Shri Mataji: pardon?
Yogi: What did you say?

00:24:10.927 --> 00:24:15.020
Shri Mataji: Turya – is the fourth state.

00:24:15.020 --> 00:24:24.290
In the fourth state you
dominate these three gunas.

00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:33.450
You control all the elements.

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:43.540
At this stage, you just say and it works.

00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:46.000
You have seen yesterday what happened with me.

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.900
It just works.

00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:55.570
You become master of these three gunas.

00:24:59.970 --> 00:25:06.825
Like I used to describe that: first you are
sitting in the car and somebody’s driving you.

00:25:06.825 --> 00:25:16.170
He uses your left and right side, or you can say,
the brake and accelerator, and the car is driven.

00:25:16.170 --> 00:25:19.920
Then he starts teaching you how to drive.

00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:29.550
Then you start learning by using your left
and right – accelerator and your brake.

00:25:29.550 --> 00:25:44.070
Then the third stage comes in where you become
a driver but still you are worried about the

00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:47.520
master who is sitting behind, that still you
are doing a mistake, you are doing wrong.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:55.290
But then the fourth stage come, you
become the master, you make others drive.

00:25:55.290 --> 00:26:02.790
Order here, anyone, order the
Sun, order the Moon, order.

00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:06.960
Order means just tell them, I mean not
question of any domination is there.

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:11.430
Just desire it, just say it, it works out.

00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:17.880
Now this fourth stage is called as Turya Dasha.

00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:26.460
Then comes the fifth stage in which, I don’t
want to give you names you’ll stick on to those.

00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:33.720
They are not so clear cut, they mingle from
each other you see, and they are mixtures.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:43.080
But in Turya state when you mature properly then
you jump into the fifth state, in which you do

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.640
not even, you do ‘sankalpa’ [act by will],
you do not even determine or say anything.

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:58.920
You just, anything slips out of your
mouth, may not even slip out, it works.

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:01.450
Is a state.

00:27:05.590 --> 00:27:08.680
Where you handle the whole
situation, sitting down here.

00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:13.030
Sitting down here, you know each and every thing.

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:21.970
Then not only you mastered it but
in that you can enter into it.

00:27:21.970 --> 00:27:28.630
Now, for example, I’ll tell you what: I can enter
into your subconscious, into your collective

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:44.870
subconscious, into your supraconscious, into
all the areas, you see, I can go, if I want to.

00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:50.300
This is when you have mastered it
completely, then you enter into it.

00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.190
When you are the master then you enter into it.

00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:55.250
When you are master of this house
you can enter into any place.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:28:12.080
Then comes the seventh state and that
is the state where you, just you are.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:18.770
Your being there is sufficient.

00:28:19.410 --> 00:28:20.790
Just being there.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:24.690
Nothing exists but you – for yourself.

00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:38.320
Now all these seven states you
can reach because I stand beyond

00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:43.960
them and I have come down to the first
state and I’m trying to pull you out.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:47.320
If you do not drag me down
I can pull you up very fast.

00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:51.130
So only request is don’t drag me down.

00:28:58.290 --> 00:29:00.720
That’s how the becoming is going to be.

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:06.840
Now this is the basics, you
can call the basic structure.

00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:11.655
Now you are filling all the beautiful
things in between – how to do it.

00:29:11.655 --> 00:29:18.570
And all the things can be nicely, again, arranged
and re-decorated and can be done properly.

00:29:18.570 --> 00:29:26.400
But this is the basic structure of becoming.

00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:32.490
Now do not try to fix up yourself
at this stage or that stage because

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:37.050
that’s very common with people
who are still thinking about it.

00:29:37.050 --> 00:29:44.580
Then, “Mother, at what stage I am?”
It is, you see, it’s common in you.

00:29:44.580 --> 00:29:50.580
When you grow yourself, it will happen to you.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.885
You don’t have to determine anything.

00:29:51.885 --> 00:29:54.300
It should happen to you, that’s all.

00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:55.993
Allow it to grow.

00:29:55.993 --> 00:29:56.010
Allow it to grow.

00:29:56.010 --> 00:30:08.560
But at least you are at a place where
you are doubtlessly aware, most of you.

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:16.300
But still I would say the basic
desire is still not that strong.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:22.975
The force of Kundalini is not that
strong, the basic desire is not.

00:30:22.975 --> 00:30:24.580
That should be cleared out.

00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:31.270
You see, sometimes it happens the house can be
demolished because basics are not all right.

00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:35.980
Sometimes in the basics there are mistakes.

00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:39.218
So you go down into yourself,
dive down, and find out.

00:30:39.218 --> 00:30:42.790
“Oh, this is the still there."
Take it out.

00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:44.350
You have to weed out these things.

00:30:44.350 --> 00:30:49.660
And that weeding out requires real alertness.

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:57.220
But don’t get into self-pity or don’t get
into, what you call this ‘guilt’ business.

00:30:57.220 --> 00:31:02.050
But a very positive attitude
towards yourself that, “All right,

00:31:02.050 --> 00:31:04.990
that’s my car, I have to put it right."

00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:10.360
Even if you become the master of the car
and the car is useless, what’s the use?

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.570
Desire is the car.

00:31:13.570 --> 00:31:22.240
Kundalini, Kundalini is that desire.

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:33.040
If your Kundalini is weak, try to sustain it,
try to improve it, try to raise it, Feed it.

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:37.256
Feed your Kundalini with desires of becoming.

00:31:37.256 --> 00:31:44.550
You neutralize all other desires with one desire.

00:31:44.550 --> 00:31:48.570
Before you say something, think
of it, what are you saying?

00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:50.490
Are you saying of one desire?

00:31:50.490 --> 00:31:59.340
You have the greatest fortune
that you have someone here who

00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:03.540
loves you very much and who can give you all this.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.890
You are extremely fortunate people.

00:32:07.890 --> 00:32:10.260
So make use of it.

00:32:11.750 --> 00:32:12.980
May God bless you.

00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:18.140
But at this stage, where you
are, you have to develop faith.

00:32:18.140 --> 00:32:26.810
All of you require more faith
and more faith, that’s all.

00:32:26.810 --> 00:32:33.260
And as soon as this faith – this is
the source, this is how you absorb,

00:32:33.260 --> 00:32:38.270
this is the sap in you which
is going to grow this tree.

00:32:38.270 --> 00:32:42.050
More faith and more faith and more faith.

00:32:42.050 --> 00:32:50.836
Because you have crossed the limit of doubts
now, so the faith is going to work it out.

00:32:50.836 --> 00:32:54.704
We have time for mantras.

00:33:15.199 --> 00:33:21.405
Shri Mataji: If you see the bhoots sitting
there, just get rid of them – very simple.

00:33:21.405 --> 00:33:27.308
You just tell them, “In the name
of Mataji, get out!” All right?

00:33:27.308 --> 00:33:30.000
And they’ll all take a flight.

00:33:31.289 --> 00:33:39.001
But when you say that “in the name,” what
is the strength of your faith in that name?

00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.919
What is your authority?

00:33:49.967 --> 00:33:54.411
Do you see my point?

00:34:42.339 --> 00:34:46.166
Shri Mataji: It’s also your desire.

00:34:46.562 --> 00:34:49.008
You see, it’s only your desire.

00:34:49.008 --> 00:34:50.307
I have no desire.

00:34:50.307 --> 00:34:57.938
It’s your desire; it is like your good
will has come as your Mother, all right?

00:34:57.938 --> 00:35:00.686
Your highest Self has come as your Mother.

00:35:00.686 --> 00:35:02.686
That’s also your own.

00:35:06.249 --> 00:35:13.889
When I say that, “I want to pull you out”,
I mean that’s your desire is, that’s why.

00:35:14.285 --> 00:35:22.311
If you do not have this desire,
I’ll not do it, all right?

00:35:24.775 --> 00:35:30.921
If you don’t want, I’ll not do it.
Sahaja Yogini: No, I do!

00:35:38.223 --> 00:35:44.725
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, what did you
mean when you said, “Please don’t

00:35:44.725 --> 00:35:49.629
pull me down” or something like that?
Shri Mataji: No, no you drag me down

00:35:49.629 --> 00:35:57.304
in the sense, that you see the pressure I
have to put in to bring you up, you see?

00:35:57.304 --> 00:36:00.888
And while you have still your
attention into something old.

00:36:00.888 --> 00:36:10.454
So, when somebody’s trying to take you
out of that, try to disentangle yourself.

00:36:10.454 --> 00:36:14.741
Because then you drag down the effort of
the person who’s trying to take you out.

00:36:14.741 --> 00:36:16.741
Do you see my point?

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:25.735
Because I’m attached to you and you
have loads, so drop them! All right?

00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.773
Are you better now Ian?

00:36:36.937 --> 00:36:42.008
It is only going to work
out how much faith you have.

00:36:42.756 --> 00:36:49.336
Faith is the only word you have
which is not good as ‘Shraddha’ is.

00:36:49.512 --> 00:36:54.097
So, I must use the word ‘faith’.

00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:03.022
Faith is the recognition – that’s why.

00:37:11.777 --> 00:37:14.269
Give them also one paper.

00:37:14.269 --> 00:37:16.269
You all share it.

00:37:16.269 --> 00:37:25.105
Come along what about you share it
