00:01:00.403 --> 00:01:04.717
Dr. Warren has already talked to you

00:01:04.742 --> 00:01:12.897
about the different centers that we have within
ourselves, and you can see how beautifully

00:01:12.922 --> 00:01:23.427
they are placed and how gradually when the
Kundalini rises, how She enlightens the innermost

00:01:23.452 --> 00:01:39.097
core of the centers. There are three channels
in the central channel, and the innermost

00:01:39.122 --> 00:01:51.691
channel is used by Kundalini to pierce through
for the first time. You can imagine Kundalini

00:01:51.782 --> 00:02:06.767
to be made of many strands of energy twine
together just like a rope, and as the chakras

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:20.244
start opening more strands start getting awakened
and they pierce through these six centers;

00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:31.026
but if a person after Realization just thinks
that he has got the Realization, then he doesn't

00:02:31.051 --> 00:02:37.400
have to bother about it, may lose it for the
time being, for quite some time I should say,

00:02:38.503 --> 00:02:46.081
and he'll have to work much harder to re-establish
his Self Realization.

00:02:47.861 --> 00:02:56.206
I've seen many-a-times when we give Realization
to people they say, “Yes, we have felt it.”

00:02:56.231 --> 00:03:06.167
They did feel it, everything happens, and
then they loose it because they have not established

00:03:06.192 --> 00:03:14.637
their Realization properly, for which luckily
in every place wherever I go I see to it that

00:03:14.662 --> 00:03:24.896
we already have a center established, then
you can go to that center and you can learn

00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:33.922
from them how to establish your Realization.
That is a very, very important time which

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:36.102
must be taken into consideration.

00:03:36.102 --> 00:03:45.230
There was a lady who had cancer, she was cured
of her cancer, she was perfectly all right

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:57.206
and she went back to her family, she was doing
very well, and after some time - a year or

00:03:57.231 --> 00:04:04.231
so - she came back with another disease of
a very serious nature.

00:04:04.562 --> 00:04:10.362
So I asked her, “How is it that you are
cured of cancer, now you get another disease?

00:04:10.362 --> 00:04:12.852
Did you do anything about it?”

00:04:12.852 --> 00:04:18.541
“No, Mother, I went back from here, everybody
says, ‘You are looking very fine.’ They

00:04:18.541 --> 00:04:24.782
are all right, they were all quite surprised
how I was cured, and I never bothered to do

00:04:24.782 --> 00:04:26.902
anything about it.”

00:04:26.902 --> 00:04:36.266
So she got another trouble. You go on like
this, you cure one thing then you again cure

00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:43.291
another thing. Like little children, you clean
them, then again they get out and soil their

00:04:43.362 --> 00:04:49.372
clothes, again they are back in the bathroom,
then again you clean them, again they do the

00:04:49.372 --> 00:04:57.687
same thing. So you have to mature, after Realization
you must in all wisdom and sensible behavior,

00:04:57.712 --> 00:05:04.342
you must mature of it, otherwise it is a big
headache to Me and big headache to you, and

00:05:04.342 --> 00:05:11.157
you can be quite lost also with it, because
if a seed is half-sprouted it is of no use

00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:12.612
at all.

00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:22.303
So if you want that you should really have
the complete bliss of Self Realization, you

00:05:22.328 --> 00:05:29.082
have to become a little serious person about
it. Shallow temperament is not going to help

00:05:29.082 --> 00:05:34.312
you, or looking at it as if like another guru
shopping business it is not going to work

00:05:34.312 --> 00:05:41.022
out. You have to work to see that you establish
yourself, till you have established you are

00:05:41.022 --> 00:05:46.791
not to work on other people but once you are
established you can start working on other

00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:53.791
people, giving them Realization. There is
no need then for you to bother that you will

00:05:53.862 --> 00:06:01.106
catch from others, or anything; but before
that you should not try to help others. First

00:06:01.131 --> 00:06:07.511
help yourself, selfishness to begin with.
Unless and until you are all right and you

00:06:07.511 --> 00:06:15.192
know all the methods of protecting yourself,
you are not to indulge into Sahaja Yoga practices

00:06:15.217 --> 00:06:23.606
which helps others. But when you become an
expert, when you have an expertise then you

00:06:23.631 --> 00:06:29.691
should do it. Like a mechanic who doesn’t
know how to repair a car, they spoil it more.

00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:34.552
So better become an expert for which you don't
have to pay anything, you don't have to do

00:06:34.552 --> 00:06:40.821
much about it but only to understand how you
have to move the Kundalini within you, how

00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:50.067
you have to establish it back, what problems
you have and how you have to cure. You will

00:06:50.092 --> 00:06:54.325
be surprised you won't be aware of problems
that you have.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.701
One gentleman came and told Me, “Mother
everyone is coming and asking me, ‘what

00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:02.131
about your father, what's the problem?’”

00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:04.691
I said, “Everybody said the same?”

00:07:04.691 --> 00:07:06.011
He said, “Yes.”

00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:08.501
I said, “I also want to know, what about
your father?”

00:07:08.501 --> 00:07:14.821
He said, “My father died very early in life,
and I always had a feeling that I had no father.”

00:07:14.821 --> 00:07:21.821
That can be cured, and he developed asthma
with it, so everybody knows, those who know

00:07:21.832 --> 00:07:28.582
one thing that is the truth about you. All
of them will say the same thing, even if it

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:33.881
is a small child, he will also come and ask
you that “Is your father all right?” Because

00:07:33.881 --> 00:07:39.501
if he knows that this center, this center
on the right hand side means the father. So

00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:46.451
he will also say the same and then he will
come and ask you, “what about your father?”

00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:53.451
It is so remarkable sometimes the way people
see these things that they can't believe it,

00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:58.631
but this is nothing, what you get is just
a wee bit of it.

00:07:58.631 --> 00:08:06.674
But as Kundalini rises, on every center you
start getting the light of that center. At

00:08:06.944 --> 00:08:17.381
the first center you get back your innocence,
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes

00:08:17.412 --> 00:08:23.952
innocent, you are not filled with lust and
greed, you don't look at things with lust

00:08:23.952 --> 00:08:30.912
and greed, but you look at things with innocence,
which is a very big thing that people have

00:08:30.912 --> 00:08:38.144
lost and that you get back and such a person
develops many qualities. One of them is that

00:08:38.169 --> 00:08:47.198
such a person is full of fragrance, such a
person has a tremendous gravity, tremendous

00:08:47.992 --> 00:08:57.487
gravity, and such a person has tremendous
dynamism, and attraction is a bad word so

00:08:57.622 --> 00:09:01.432
I don't want to use it, but magnetical.

00:09:01.432 --> 00:09:09.272
His magnets is awakened within him, this is
the center of your magnet of the earth. Such

00:09:10.161 --> 00:09:19.186
a person develops a tremendous sense of roots
and sense of direction, you place him anywhere

00:09:19.211 --> 00:09:25.141
he will know where to go. Like birds, you
place birds anywhere they know which side

00:09:25.141 --> 00:09:33.405
is north, south, east, west. In the same way
you also develop your lost innocence and your

00:09:33.809 --> 00:09:40.382
magnet within you by which you have proper
direction; but the highest of all you develop

00:09:40.382 --> 00:09:48.227
the proper direction to wisdom which is the
wise thing to do. You just don't do stupid

00:09:48.252 --> 00:09:55.252
things, you just don't do, even if you ever
try to do it, you will not do it, because

00:09:55.271 --> 00:10:04.417
you know it is so stupid, just you don't do
it. I mean it is so simple to be wise than

00:10:04.442 --> 00:10:10.841
to be stupid, because if you have to be stupid
you have to go out of the way to be stupid

00:10:10.841 --> 00:10:18.217
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal
and wise is the easiest thing to do. But what

00:10:18.242 --> 00:10:27.816
people do is to do things that would make
them more and more stupid, nonsensical, because

00:10:27.841 --> 00:10:36.573
also some people told Me they do it, the reason
being they think they have a nuisance value.

00:10:36.598 --> 00:10:42.232
Like in London now we have one funny stuff
going on, they call it what? “Punk rock.”

00:10:42.232 --> 00:10:47.692
You see, it's a funny stuff. Now poor things
they don't know what they are doing it, and

00:10:47.692 --> 00:11:00.277
I think the only value of that punk rock system
is this: that they try to sort of make a nuisance

00:11:00.302 --> 00:11:05.562
out of them so that people feel attracted
towards them or sort of a significance out

00:11:05.562 --> 00:11:12.391
of them. But when you become a realized soul
you realize your significance, because you

00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:19.391
understand you are part and parcel of the
whole and that your significance is to give

00:11:19.581 --> 00:11:26.581
Realization to others, the highest of highest,
that's what you have to do now you are a saint,

00:11:26.868 --> 00:11:36.087
and that’s how the whole attitude of cheapiness,
of outward shallowness finishes and you become

00:11:36.112 --> 00:11:43.112
a serene, dignified personality. This is not
possible through any sermon, any lecture,

00:11:43.271 --> 00:11:51.806
it's only possible when the Kundalini rises
you become like a very dignified child, very

00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:54.062
dignified child.

00:11:54.062 --> 00:12:04.412
I've seen one beautiful painting done of Mother
Mary being taught first time. You see Her

00:12:04.461 --> 00:12:10.331
as a child, She is a very dignified personality,
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:17.436
I've seen My own grandchildren who are not
very old but extremely dignified. They walk

00:12:17.461 --> 00:12:23.831
like kings, behave like kings. In every behavior
you find there's such a dignity, they'll never

00:12:23.831 --> 00:12:29.091
do something shallow, they never ask for anything,
they never weep for anything, they never cry

00:12:29.091 --> 00:12:35.141
for anything, they are so dignified and they
understand it so well what is dignity is.

00:12:35.141 --> 00:12:40.813
I don't have to tell them, because they are
born realized, in the same way you become,

00:12:40.838 --> 00:12:45.742
nobody has to tell you that “do this, or
do that,” but you understand that you must

00:12:45.742 --> 00:12:53.267
have self-respect. This happens to you automatically,
this is actualization, nobody has to tell

00:12:53.292 --> 00:12:57.932
you that “you be dignified,” you just
become. I've seen people who were absolutely

00:12:57.932 --> 00:13:03.821
absurd, even from this punk rock we got some
people and they were so changed that people

00:13:03.821 --> 00:13:08.942
could not recognize them, but one thing bad
has happened with this punk rock that they

00:13:08.942 --> 00:13:15.062
put some sort of dye in their head and since
then their eyes became very weak, because

00:13:15.062 --> 00:13:23.092
these dyes I think made the optic globe covered
with some sort of a color and you can't see

00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:28.782
properly, and the eyes became very weak and
it took some time for us to remove the effect

00:13:28.782 --> 00:13:31.282
of those dyes from their head.

00:13:31.282 --> 00:13:36.422
We go headlong, “what's wrong?” There
is nothing wrong in this world if it is a

00:13:36.422 --> 00:13:42.732
stupid fool, but for a wise man there are
very many things which are absolutely wrong,

00:13:42.732 --> 00:13:49.732
and there are very many things which are absolutely
correct, so you develop your wisdom by this

00:13:49.862 --> 00:13:51.232
first center.

00:13:51.232 --> 00:13:58.767
Now as the Kundalini rises She enlightens
your second center which we can call as the

00:13:58.792 --> 00:14:03.552
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though
it is the third center. But second center,

00:14:03.552 --> 00:14:11.457
you become extremely creative, extremely creative.
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had

00:14:11.482 --> 00:14:13.071
no job.

00:14:13.071 --> 00:14:15.711
And he said, “Mother, I have no job and
what should I do?”

00:14:15.711 --> 00:14:18.292
I said, “All right, what do you want to
do?”

00:14:18.292 --> 00:14:19.912
He said, “Whatever you say.”

00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:23.622
I said, “All right, why don't you become
an interior decorator?”

00:14:23.622 --> 00:14:28.812
He said, “Me? I don't know what is a teak
wood, I don’t know what is a rose wood,

00:14:28.812 --> 00:14:30.732
how am I to become an interior decorator?”

00:14:30.732 --> 00:14:33.422
I said, “You just use your vibrations.”

00:14:33.422 --> 00:14:38.542
And you'll be surprised he earned million
of rupees out of that profession because you

00:14:38.542 --> 00:14:47.046
become extremely creative, your sense of creation
becomes so subtle and so beautiful that you

00:14:47.071 --> 00:14:53.222
start understanding art at such a high level
that people don't know how, when you are not

00:14:53.222 --> 00:15:00.172
educated in art, how you can do it. I went
to Japan once, and they were having an Ikebana

00:15:00.172 --> 00:15:05.021
competition or something, so I went to see
the Ikebana class and they requested Me, “Why

00:15:05.021 --> 00:15:06.631
don't you do some flower arrangements?”

00:15:06.631 --> 00:15:08.752
I said, “All right, I'll do.”

00:15:08.752 --> 00:15:15.131
I did it and I got the highest marks without
knowing a word about Ikebana, just surprise

00:15:15.131 --> 00:15:21.242
Me, I got the highest mark. I can do lots
of things which I've never done before like

00:15:21.242 --> 00:15:26.472
architecture. I have built houses without
doing any architecture, I've done decorations

00:15:26.472 --> 00:15:33.757
of the houses, I've done all kinds of things
without knowing how to it, because you become

00:15:33.782 --> 00:15:35.182
you so creative.

00:15:35.182 --> 00:15:40.372
Music you start understanding so much better.
There are people now in America, there's a

00:15:40.372 --> 00:15:46.372
girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice, absolutely
hoarse voice, and she always used to go out

00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:47.622
of tune.

00:15:47.622 --> 00:15:51.222
So I told her, “You shouldn’t sing songs
before Me because it’s rather funny.”

00:15:51.222 --> 00:15:54.341
She said, “Mother, why don't You give me
a good voice?”

00:15:54.341 --> 00:15:59.341
I said, “You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll

00:15:59.341 --> 00:16:01.451
be all right.”

00:16:01.451 --> 00:16:07.802
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don’t you
sit down.]

00:16:07.802 --> 00:16:14.232
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was … she tried
on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations, and

00:16:14.232 --> 00:16:21.232
she sings so melodiously now that I tell you
she can be a great singer. So the creativity,

00:16:21.232 --> 00:16:30.106
that also is a blessing of your power of the
Goddess of learning. Boys who could not study

00:16:30.131 --> 00:16:35.792
in the schools were absolutely duffers. Some
people brought this boy, recently I’ve received

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:36.842
a letter from him.

00:16:36.842 --> 00:16:40.622
When he came to Me, his father said that “He
is going to be taken out of school because

00:16:40.622 --> 00:16:44.612
he's good for nothing, he can not remember
anything, he's absolutely finished.”

00:16:44.612 --> 00:16:49.202
I said, “All right, doesn't matter, let
him take to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:16:49.202 --> 00:16:55.422
He got his Realization. Not only that he passed
with first class, but he got a scholarship.

00:16:55.422 --> 00:17:02.987
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young

00:17:03.012 --> 00:17:08.452
age. He wrote to Me, “Mother no one can
believe that a duffer like me has been so

00:17:08.452 --> 00:17:14.622
much highly placed.” All the boys who got
scholarships in Maharashtra in schools, in

00:17:14.622 --> 00:17:18.912
colleges and universities are Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:18.912 --> 00:17:25.502
It is such a tremendous force that starts
working in you, if you try to give vibrations

00:17:25.502 --> 00:17:37.977
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat
and such things which are very important for

00:17:38.002 --> 00:17:46.727
life, any food, you will be amazed that the
food also grows so much more and the taste

00:17:46.752 --> 00:17:53.522
is so good and it lasts you so longer. Like
one gentleman tried, a university professor

00:17:53.522 --> 00:18:01.177
in agricultural college on some wheat, some
vibrations and he was amazed that when they

00:18:01.202 --> 00:18:07.412
collected this wheat it was at least six times
more than normal, and when this wheat was

00:18:07.412 --> 00:18:17.710
stored in a big hall like this, there were
so many other things, the rats who are always

00:18:17.782 --> 00:18:22.832
a menace in India never touched that wheat.
They ate all the rest of it but never touched

00:18:22.832 --> 00:18:24.162
the wheat.

00:18:24.162 --> 00:18:32.587
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers,
of course the dogs and the cats - understand

00:18:32.612 --> 00:18:38.642
it much more, they understand you, they know
that you are a saint. They'll never touch

00:18:38.642 --> 00:18:43.362
you, they will never trouble you. Even a tiger
sees a saint, he never attacks. You can handle

00:18:43.362 --> 00:18:48.832
a tiger very easily; this is the power of
a saint. So you develop a tremendous capacity

00:18:48.832 --> 00:18:59.027
of creativity. The greatest capacity you have
then is of creating a new human being out

00:18:59.052 --> 00:19:05.872
of a ordinary human being. This is the greatest
blessing that you have, that you transform

00:19:05.872 --> 00:19:13.097
an egg into a bird and that is the epitome,
that is the spiritual power you have, by which

00:19:13.122 --> 00:19:21.657
you can transform the whole human race into
a new race which has this fifth dimension

00:19:21.682 --> 00:19:24.382
within yourself.

00:19:24.382 --> 00:19:29.692
You can start talking on science now, we have
a scientist here and he's a done his science,

00:19:29.692 --> 00:19:35.232
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that,
in chemistry and I explained to him about

00:19:35.232 --> 00:19:39.752
this - where is the hydrogen and oxygen and
nitrogen and all that within us and he was

00:19:39.752 --> 00:19:40.052
amazed.

00:19:40.052 --> 00:19:43.042
He said, “Mother, how do you know all these
things?”

00:19:43.042 --> 00:19:48.032
I said, “I don't know how I know, but I
know. That’s what it is, you just have a

00:19:48.032 --> 00:19:49.092
look at this.”

00:19:49.092 --> 00:19:55.032
And he was amazed how I was telling him about
spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

00:19:55.032 --> 00:19:57.172
He said that “For this I had to study so
much.”

00:19:57.172 --> 00:20:01.132
I said, “For Sahaja Yog you don't have to
study.” A little bit you know and immediately

00:20:01.132 --> 00:20:06.372
you click the point. Now this is the second
thing that you know in your learnings, in

00:20:06.372 --> 00:20:11.732
your education you are all right, but the
mastery of this center comes, the mastery

00:20:11.732 --> 00:20:18.732
of this center comes when you know the pure
knowledge, the pure knowledge of handling

00:20:18.812 --> 00:20:26.137
the Kundalini, the pure knowledge of Spirit,
the pure knowledge of the blessings of God,

00:20:26.162 --> 00:20:32.962
of Ritambhara Pragya. If you know that, that
is the highest that you achieve gradually

00:20:32.962 --> 00:20:40.177
as you grow, because when these centers starts
expanding on the sides, you start expanding

00:20:40.202 --> 00:20:47.602
in your personality, in your sensitivity and
in your evolutionary ascent, so that is how

00:20:47.642 --> 00:20:52.772
you start growing from one to another to another
to another.

00:20:52.772 --> 00:20:58.522
Now the third center that we have actually,
this is the second center because the third

00:20:58.522 --> 00:21:05.716
center arises, this Swadishthana arises out
of the Nabhi, is a very, very important center,

00:21:06.082 --> 00:21:13.042
is the center of your seeking as he has told
you. Your compete priorities change, complete

00:21:13.042 --> 00:21:19.592
priorities change, because the joy that you
get out of Sahaja Yoga, the joy you get out

00:21:19.592 --> 00:21:29.336
of this meditation, out of the feeling that
grows in you all the time, like a beautiful

00:21:29.392 --> 00:21:38.157
torrential rain of joy that fills you, your
life and everybody's life, you don't care

00:21:38.182 --> 00:21:47.447
for cheap type of entertainment. You feel,
you seek other Sahaja Yogi, you want to meet

00:21:47.472 --> 00:21:51.192
another Sahaja Yogi, you don't want to meet
anybody else. If there is an actor coming,

00:21:51.192 --> 00:21:55.472
or some big man is coming, “All right, let
him come, I'm going to see such and such person.”

00:21:55.472 --> 00:22:03.177
It is such a different personality that one
day - I will tell you how it happens - there

00:22:03.202 --> 00:22:08.342
was a girl, a diplomat, she's a diplomat who
is a realized soul and she happened to go

00:22:08.342 --> 00:22:13.652
to Sicily. And she was eating her food, suddenly
she felt there is some vibrations coming down,

00:22:13.652 --> 00:22:20.082
she looked around, the other one was also
looking at her, she said, “Are you Mataji's

00:22:20.082 --> 00:22:21.390
disciple?”

00:22:21.415 --> 00:22:24.002
And she said, “Yes, I am Mataji's child.”

00:22:24.002 --> 00:22:30.422
They both got up and just hugged and said,
“Such joy Mother in that far-fetched place

00:22:30.422 --> 00:22:32.852
of Sicily to find a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:22:32.852 --> 00:22:37.862
And then they stayed together and they wouldn’t
go anywhere else but they said, “Now this

00:22:37.862 --> 00:22:42.412
is the enjoyment.” Just the company of a
Sahaja Yogi is such an enjoyment.

00:22:42.412 --> 00:22:48.162
I've seen these people when they go to India,
the people are not so rich, poor people - they

00:22:48.162 --> 00:22:52.152
have little, little huts - but when they go
they go there, you should see the love, the

00:22:52.152 --> 00:22:59.152
rapport, and that makes Me so happy, so happy,
the way they love each other, the way they

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:05.842
understand each other, the way they help each
other and the only the company, for the first

00:23:05.842 --> 00:23:13.387
time they start enjoying. We were once in
a hotel staying in Calcutta and with two Sahaja

00:23:13.412 --> 00:23:17.142
Yogi with Me. They were in the other room,
quite far away, they could not get a room

00:23:17.142 --> 00:23:23.092
close to Me, and one gentleman came for his
Realization, he came to My feet, when he got

00:23:23.092 --> 00:23:27.812
his Realization it was a tremendous happening
and they came rushing from there.

00:23:27.812 --> 00:23:29.172
I said, “What happened?”

00:23:29.172 --> 00:23:34.172
They said, “We felt the vibrations, we felt
the vibrations from there, Mother, so we have

00:23:34.172 --> 00:23:36.552
come to receive the vibrations.”

00:23:36.552 --> 00:23:43.807
And they came and they felt the vibrations.
So this man was so great that his vibrations

00:23:43.832 --> 00:23:49.812
attracted them and they came down. They were
just enjoying that as if they were enjoying

00:23:49.812 --> 00:23:53.812
a big flower with lots of fragrance. What
vibrations, what vibrations! The fellow got

00:23:53.812 --> 00:23:58.748
up and said, “Very nice. They are enjoying
my vibrations. Now I'm going to enjoy your

00:23:58.773 --> 00:24:00.582
vibrations.”

00:24:00.796 --> 00:24:10.127
For the first time you start enjoying your
fellow man because everyone is a beautiful

00:24:10.152 --> 00:24:18.417
personality, a glorious, fragrant, joyful
personality; but because you cannot feel the

00:24:18.442 --> 00:24:23.712
other person, and because the other person
does not emit, you are all the time quarreling.

00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:28.012
Even husband-wife quarreling, father-mother
quarreling, this one quarreling, that quarreling.

00:24:28.012 --> 00:24:33.172
In Sahaja Yoga there is hardly any time for
people to quarrel. The other day I had a lady

00:24:33.172 --> 00:24:38.002
who came to see Me, and she was trying to
put her point and there were about five-six

00:24:38.002 --> 00:24:43.702
Sahaja Yogis, and everybody was putting the
same point and she was amazed.

00:24:43.702 --> 00:24:49.762
She said, “I've never seen such concord,
such friendship, such understanding, all of

00:24:49.762 --> 00:24:55.042
them supporting each other, nobody is cutting
anyone.”

00:24:55.042 --> 00:25:01.662
Such a society has to develop. It’s such
a nourishing, soothing, invigorating society,

00:25:01.662 --> 00:25:08.662
and you forget about getting bored, boredom
goes out of life, you never get bored, you

00:25:08.832 --> 00:25:14.392
enjoy yourself or you enjoy the company of
Sahaja Yogis and it is very different level

00:25:14.392 --> 00:25:20.672
that you come of - that is what, that land
you have to reach within yourself.

00:25:20.672 --> 00:25:28.057
Now the greatest thing that happens as a result
of this center seeking, that you start seeking

00:25:28.082 --> 00:25:34.892
other seekers, you try to find out “where
is the seeker?” If you hear somebody is

00:25:34.892 --> 00:25:40.622
a seeker, you go and see. If you hear about
someone that some people are lost there, they

00:25:40.622 --> 00:25:46.792
were seekers, but they went there lost, you
all rush there. It is like a person who is

00:25:46.792 --> 00:25:54.487
like a, what you call a guard on the seashore
you know, there are guards kept for salvaging

00:25:54.512 --> 00:26:02.027
people, and that is how you become. You suddenly
see somebody sinking, you just go. In Bombay

00:26:02.052 --> 00:26:06.382
there was a case they announce that “there’s
a lady who is going to die, if somebody can

00:26:06.382 --> 00:26:11.912
come and help her, it will be a great thing.”
They all rushed there; they saved her.

00:26:11.912 --> 00:26:18.072
Now the interests changes completely, and
you start really helping people and not feeling

00:26:18.072 --> 00:26:26.317
that you are helping them, not at all. But
the surrounding portion of that, which is

00:26:26.342 --> 00:26:33.697
the void, is the best, which is affected by
your awakening, that you become the virtue

00:26:33.722 --> 00:26:41.921
itself. Nobody has to tell you that you be
virtuous, when you are awakened you become

00:26:41.972 --> 00:26:53.267
a virtuous person, you enjoy your virtues,
you enjoy being good, you enjoy being nice,

00:26:53.292 --> 00:27:00.597
you really enjoy it. And that enjoyment comes
to you as a blessing because the virtue itself

00:27:00.622 --> 00:27:11.727
is so strengthening, so powerful that anyone
who is harmed or troubled or tortured or put

00:27:11.752 --> 00:27:20.137
down, you stand up, you are not afraid of
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

00:27:20.162 --> 00:27:27.587
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

00:27:27.612 --> 00:27:34.382
I'm just a lady and single-handed I told them
who these people are, how they are going to

00:27:34.382 --> 00:27:40.242
loot you, and what they are going to do; but
in this country nobody can think of one genuine

00:27:40.242 --> 00:27:47.677
person who could be really genuine. It was
the problem that time, but with this awakening

00:27:47.702 --> 00:27:53.402
within you of the virtuous nature, you just
know what is virtue and what is not virtue.

00:27:53.402 --> 00:27:59.752
I don't have to tell you; I don't say “don't
do this, don't do that.” I never say that,

00:27:59.752 --> 00:28:06.857
it just happens, because when the virtue starts
developing, the vibrations improve and you

00:28:06.882 --> 00:28:18.211
feel extremely joyous. We have lost our virtues
because there is no joy out of it, no reward.

00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:23.852
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer; if
somebody's good, he has to suffer; is somebody's

00:28:23.852 --> 00:28:31.428
kind, he thinks he has to suffer; but after
getting Realization you are rewarded for your

00:28:31.453 --> 00:28:32.585
virtues.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:37.962
You are amazed how you are paid for it, it’s
so surprising, like once there was a lady

00:28:37.962 --> 00:28:43.082
who came to see Me, she was a refugee, and
I had a big house.

00:28:43.082 --> 00:28:45.482
So I said, “All right come and stay with
Me.”

00:28:45.482 --> 00:28:49.082
So My husband, My brother they came, they
said, “What's this? You don't know her,

00:28:49.082 --> 00:28:52.762
who she is, her husband, whether he is her
husband or not, just given her two rooms.

00:28:52.762 --> 00:28:53.532
It's not good!”

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:57.692
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter. I
know for nothing is going to happen, let her

00:28:57.692 --> 00:28:58.392
be here.”

00:28:58.392 --> 00:29:00.912
So they wouldn't also go against Me. They
said, “All right, if you say so.”

00:29:00.912 --> 00:29:07.232
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.
Then she become a very well-known actress

00:29:07.232 --> 00:29:11.632
in India, I didn't know she was the same lady,
but somebody told Me that she is the same

00:29:11.632 --> 00:29:12.782
lady. I said, “Maybe.”

00:29:12.782 --> 00:29:18.192
Then one day you see, they wanted to make
a film for our Sahaja Yoga, so they said,

00:29:18.192 --> 00:29:21.642
“We can ask this lady to act, because she
is a good actress.”

00:29:21.642 --> 00:29:25.972
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don't
tell her I am here, otherwise she will have

00:29:25.972 --> 00:29:28.932
no choice. I will not go and see her. You
just ask her.”

00:29:28.932 --> 00:29:32.642
They went and ask her, they said, “Will
you be actress?” and all that.

00:29:32.642 --> 00:29:34.634
She said, “I'll try.” This, that she was
saying.

00:29:34.659 --> 00:29:39.312
But on the day on when they were going to
open the film I went there, she saw Me, she

00:29:39.312 --> 00:29:44.152
was so amazed, she said, “Oh God, You are
the One, You are the One Who is sponsoring

00:29:44.152 --> 00:29:46.902
this, Oh, I’ll give my life for Her!”
She just came forward, she said, “Have anything

00:29:46.902 --> 00:29:53.782
you like, I have nothing to say, I am so sorry
that you never told me that She's there.”

00:29:53.782 --> 00:29:59.402
Thousand times more she rewarded a little
thing I did for her.

00:29:59.402 --> 00:30:05.682
No more cheating, no more troubling, you become
a wonderful person and so many people become

00:30:05.682 --> 00:30:10.692
your friends in this world. Your have to just
tell you are coming, there will hundred people

00:30:10.692 --> 00:30:15.282
at the airport to receive you. There will
be so many friends all over the world for

00:30:15.282 --> 00:30:21.172
you, you will be amazed. It's such a tremendous
thing happens, because now you all are awakened

00:30:21.172 --> 00:30:27.302
in that Primordial Being and you have become
one with each other. You can feel it, that

00:30:27.302 --> 00:30:32.802
oneness, that unison that we are all not only
human beings but we are yogis, we are super

00:30:32.802 --> 00:30:38.782
human beings, and we have to look after the
whole world. That feeling of compassion is

00:30:38.782 --> 00:30:46.267
so overwhelming that all little, little stupid
things just fall off, there's no place for

00:30:46.292 --> 00:30:49.942
that. This actually happens and has happened
with many.

00:30:49.942 --> 00:30:54.452
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories, but

00:30:54.452 --> 00:31:00.252
there are many, some of them were so hot tempered,
some of them were so quarrelsome, some them

00:31:00.252 --> 00:31:04.292
used to fight so much in the beginning that
I thought, “How are they going to be all

00:31:04.292 --> 00:31:11.162
right?” But today I find them as great friends
and very great yogis. So this is the center

00:31:11.162 --> 00:31:16.672
where your religion is awakened. And what
is a religion? Word comes from “religo,”

00:31:16.672 --> 00:31:22.202
in Sanskrit it means dharma, “Dhariyatisa
Dharma,” the sustenance, your sustenance,

00:31:22.202 --> 00:31:28.592
your valances is your religion. As every atom,
carbon has four valances, and in the same

00:31:28.592 --> 00:31:34.462
way you have ten valances, these are the ten
commandments that were told to you and you

00:31:34.462 --> 00:31:42.137
become that, you just become. I don't have
to tell you as commandments but they become

00:31:42.162 --> 00:31:48.932
your beautiful ornaments within yourself.
This happens automatically, so spontaneously

00:31:48.932 --> 00:31:50.082
you become that.

00:31:50.082 --> 00:31:55.982
A bishop came to see Me the other day, he
is a relation of Mine, My brother. He came

00:31:55.982 --> 00:32:01.592
to see Me, and he was rather adamant and little
angry when he came to see Me because he thought,

00:32:01.592 --> 00:32:04.142
“Why am I trying to do this kind of thing?”

00:32:04.142 --> 00:32:08.562
But when he saw the Sahaja Yogis he said,
“I'm amazed, you know, I've been giving

00:32:08.562 --> 00:32:14.812
lectures in the church for years together,
but I could not achieve anything. How have

00:32:14.812 --> 00:32:21.042
You transformed these people? The drug addicts
have suddenly become such good people that

00:32:21.042 --> 00:32:25.670
they have given up drugs, alcoholics have
given up alcohol. How is it without telling

00:32:25.695 --> 00:32:26.709
them anything?”

00:32:26.734 --> 00:32:32.512
I said, “Everything is within them. As soon
as the light comes you can see everything.

00:32:32.512 --> 00:32:35.882
You know that this is on your way, this is
against your progress, this is anti-life,

00:32:35.882 --> 00:32:40.632
you just give up. Only thing you have to have
the light within you.”

00:32:40.632 --> 00:32:47.342
So he himself was surprised at this and then
he said, “Really, that should be done, is

00:32:47.342 --> 00:32:48.402
to transform them.”

00:32:48.402 --> 00:32:53.292
But I said, “You do not transform them by
giving them big sermons, you transform them

00:32:53.292 --> 00:33:00.647
by giving them the real second birth, real
baptism.” And I must say that Calvinist,

00:33:00.672 --> 00:33:06.302
of all the persons, Calvinist in Geneva have
accepted Me and they think that this is the

00:33:06.302 --> 00:33:08.232
only way they can transform you.

00:33:08.257 --> 00:33:15.317
You will be amazed the Calvinist of all the
persons who are such I should say one-sided

00:33:15.342 --> 00:33:23.037
people, they have accepted to see the result
of everybody who is open-minded person, who

00:33:23.062 --> 00:33:28.462
thinks for the good of others and not for
money-making and for selfish ends. We'll see

00:33:28.462 --> 00:33:34.162
one day that this is the way it has to be.
God has given us this power, we have got a

00:33:34.162 --> 00:33:39.252
Spirit within us, we should try to awaken
that and we should accept it, not because

00:33:39.252 --> 00:33:45.931
I'm doing it, you can do it also. So this
thing happens to you with this chakra.

00:33:45.931 --> 00:33:50.911
Now with the another chakra on top, that is
one - as he has told the diseases, I'm telling

00:33:50.911 --> 00:33:57.082
you the positive side of it - when this chakra
is caught up he must have told you, you develop

00:33:57.082 --> 00:34:04.082
breast cancer and all that. But when it is
awakened, you get all the security of the

00:34:04.792 --> 00:34:11.792
world, you are never insecure, you are never
bothered, you have no fear of anyone. You

00:34:13.721 --> 00:34:17.651
do not have to suggest yourself that “you
should not have fear or anything,” you just

00:34:17.651 --> 00:34:25.427
become fearless, there is no nothing like
fear, there's no reaction to any threat or

00:34:25.452 --> 00:34:30.351
anything. Like the gentleman who came here,
just to beat Me now, I was just looking at

00:34:30.351 --> 00:34:35.192
the drama, and the fellow was getting frightened
of Me, he was going backwards, backwards,

00:34:35.192 --> 00:34:41.502
he would not come forward. But you don't develop
any fear of at all about anyone, because you

00:34:41.502 --> 00:34:48.212
are standing on truth, like Christ. At the
time when He was challenged, you must know

00:34:48.212 --> 00:34:55.212
when Mary Magdalene was beaten up, He stood
up. He had nothing to do with the prostitute,

00:34:55.282 --> 00:35:00.282
such a virtuous man, He was virtue personified,
He stood up, He said, “Those who have not

00:35:00.282 --> 00:35:05.772
committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me.”
He was sure nobody can do it because He was

00:35:05.772 --> 00:35:07.012
an authority of virtue.

00:35:07.012 --> 00:35:14.757
I, as I told you, I am just a woman and I
spoke openly with the names of these people

00:35:14.782 --> 00:35:20.552
and told of what they are going to do, and
how they are going to possess you. And people

00:35:20.552 --> 00:35:22.542
came, they were frightened, they said, “What
are You doing?”

00:35:22.542 --> 00:35:29.542
So you get rid of all your fear, but you do
not dominate anyone, you love, in your love

00:35:30.722 --> 00:35:41.316
you are secured. It is not by domination but
the security that you are love, you are compassion.

00:35:41.341 --> 00:35:50.079
And the power of love is the highest of all,
that you stand in complete peace and bliss.

00:35:50.792 --> 00:35:55.431
This happens to you when the central thing
comes up. There are many other things happen,

00:35:55.431 --> 00:36:00.312
you can become a poet, I mean so many things
happen with this, because you become such

00:36:00.312 --> 00:36:08.037
a compassion, such a compassion. And when
this compassion starts working you are given

00:36:08.062 --> 00:36:12.062
all the help that is needed.

00:36:12.062 --> 00:36:16.161
Then the another chakra - I am going a little
fast because after all you understand that

00:36:16.161 --> 00:36:22.171
there isn't much time today, I've been speaking,
and speaking every day, it’s a marathon

00:36:22.171 --> 00:36:29.437
race for Me, so I'll try to make it short
now - it's the Vishuddhi Chakra as he told

00:36:29.462 --> 00:36:39.500
you is very important, this is America. Vishuddhi
Chakra is America in the Universe. America

00:36:39.525 --> 00:36:50.007
is the Vishuddhi Chakra and the star is the
Saturn. There are seventeen of them, sixteen

00:36:50.032 --> 00:36:56.792
is the planet moving round, there are sixteen
centers there and the seventeenth is the Vishuddhi

00:36:56.792 --> 00:37:05.606
itself. Is a very important thing that this
center is America, so America has the responsibility

00:37:05.631 --> 00:37:14.866
of transformation. They have to take up the
responsibility of transforming the whole world.

00:37:14.891 --> 00:37:21.953
Instead of that they themselves are getting
ruined, they are killing themselves. There

00:37:21.978 --> 00:37:30.927
is no fear from outside I tell you, we are
going to be ruined from inside. What a responsibility

00:37:30.952 --> 00:37:36.861
you have and what we are doing you should
see to that. That’s why so many seekers

00:37:36.861 --> 00:37:46.410
are born here, but they do not feel the responsibility
of transformation. They will, one day it will

00:37:46.542 --> 00:37:53.806
come, they will have to feel it, once they
are awakened I'm sure they will feel that

00:37:53.831 --> 00:37:54.571
responsibility.

00:37:54.571 --> 00:38:04.626
This very important center as he must have
told you, by the virtue of this on the gross

00:38:04.651 --> 00:38:14.346
we develop a face which is very relaxed and
attractive and good looking. We develop eyes

00:38:14.371 --> 00:38:25.477
which are full of compassion; we develop a
face which is innocent, which is very smooth

00:38:25.502 --> 00:38:34.406
and which has got a capacity to express its
feeling. The smallest of feelings can be expressed

00:38:34.431 --> 00:38:40.921
through this center. It looks after your nose,
yours ears, everything improves with this.

00:38:40.921 --> 00:38:47.921
You develop - now I can't hear anything if
a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me. It is a very

00:38:47.958 --> 00:38:53.591
funny thing, unless and until that person
is very close I just can't hear what he is

00:38:53.591 --> 00:38:59.431
saying, to Me, it is all what you call “blah,
blah, blah.” But a Sahaja Yogi, if he speaks

00:38:59.431 --> 00:39:02.081
to Me I can hear very well.

00:39:02.081 --> 00:39:10.997
The whole thing changes, the whole sensitivity
changes, you start understanding what music

00:39:11.022 --> 00:39:21.306
is good for your Spirit; you start understanding
what is good for your eyes to see, because

00:39:21.331 --> 00:39:26.381
you don't want like to see that is something
that is horrid, you just don't enjoy it. You

00:39:26.381 --> 00:39:30.062
feel like vomiting - you see something horrid,
you just feel like vomiting. You become so

00:39:30.062 --> 00:39:35.012
sensitive you can't imagine, to virtue and
to goodness.

00:39:35.012 --> 00:39:41.742
Automatically it happens to you, I don't have
to tell you. I've seen people have changed

00:39:41.742 --> 00:39:48.742
overnight. The whole idea is that the light
has to be brought in for you to see for yourself,

00:39:48.752 --> 00:39:54.831
and when it happens you'll be amazed, you
become such a different, wonderful person.

00:39:54.831 --> 00:40:01.831
There's everyone in America has Abraham Lincoln
within them, which has to be just awakened

00:40:01.856 --> 00:40:10.302
and you'll find that that great personality
can be shown in you, when it happens to you.

00:40:10.327 --> 00:40:17.492
It has to happen to all of you to feel that
greatness that lies hidden within.

00:40:17.931 --> 00:40:23.272
I cannot elaborately tell you about Vishuddhi
Chakra what they call the Krishna consciousness,

00:40:23.272 --> 00:40:29.512
but not this Krishna consciousness which has
made people actual beggars, they are begging

00:40:29.512 --> 00:40:34.762
on the streets. You go in India in the villages,
about they were going to beat these people.

00:40:34.762 --> 00:40:38.811
They thought they are Krishna consciousness,
they wouldn’t get places in the hotels because

00:40:38.811 --> 00:40:42.732
they thought they are Krishna consciousness,
because these people were lost, they had no

00:40:42.732 --> 00:40:48.331
money left with them. Now they are begging
in India, imagine. How can we afford to have

00:40:48.331 --> 00:40:52.341
these beggars there? They have no money with
them, they can not come back, they don't know

00:40:52.341 --> 00:40:59.881
what to do with them, so many you will find
in the villages just begging. So this kind

00:41:00.061 --> 00:41:10.406
of thing that - imagine a person who is being
blessed by Shri Krishna Who is the Deity on

00:41:10.431 --> 00:41:12.891
this center, should beg!

00:41:12.891 --> 00:41:19.131
He's the One Who is the giver of complete
wealth, why should we beg? This is the thing

00:41:19.131 --> 00:41:25.071
they don't understand, just the opposite of
what they are suppose to be. There are lots

00:41:25.071 --> 00:41:31.492
of stories of Krishna how He blessed people
with wealth. It is to be seen sometimes, if

00:41:31.492 --> 00:41:36.641
you have time, I may have time then we might
be able to see all those beautiful things

00:41:36.641 --> 00:41:39.321
that He did.

00:41:39.321 --> 00:41:47.027
So the other chakra is important, is the Chakra
of Christ. This center is very important because

00:41:47.052 --> 00:41:52.742
this is the gate through this you have to
pass to your destination which is the limbic

00:41:52.742 --> 00:41:58.302
area. So Christ is the gate, many people are
shouting, “it's only He can save.” Where

00:41:58.302 --> 00:42:04.431
is He now? Is He here? When He was living,
they talked of Ibrahim, when He came then

00:42:04.431 --> 00:42:09.702
they said, “You are not the One. It was
Moses. You are not the One.”

00:42:09.702 --> 00:42:15.212
They denied Him, defied Him. Now when He's
dead, then we think, “It is Christ.” Now

00:42:15.212 --> 00:42:21.222
I have come, He's talked about Me, if you
read Bible you'll find He’s talked about

00:42:21.222 --> 00:42:26.272
Me very clearly there and I have to do My
job and I have come. You are going to say

00:42:26.272 --> 00:42:32.222
that it was Christ Who has to do it. If Christ
could do it, why did He say that “I'm going

00:42:32.222 --> 00:42:36.871
to send you a comforter”? He talked of future,
didn’t He? Why did He say such a thing?

00:42:36.871 --> 00:42:41.321
We should find out why did He say that “I
will send you the Holy Ghost and the Comforter

00:42:41.321 --> 00:42:46.321
and the Redeemer and a Counselor”? Why did
He say that? Why not look forward to that?

00:42:46.321 --> 00:42:51.762
Because we are today after Christ. People
don't want to see this point, they want to

00:42:51.762 --> 00:42:56.361
depend on Christ because He's in their pocket,
they can use Him the way they like.

00:42:56.361 --> 00:43:05.902
When He has talked, He has said, “Why not
see the point?” If this is what Christ is,

00:43:05.927 --> 00:43:13.589
then it is such a bad thing because people
say, “Christ was no good.” They say, “What

00:43:13.614 --> 00:43:18.532
has Christ given us?” Christians nations,
what have they done, what have they achieved?

00:43:18.532 --> 00:43:25.532
It's a bad name to Him if you do not see completion
of His work. I'm here to complete His work

00:43:26.407 --> 00:43:32.821
and when you do not complete His work, His
half-work done in a very half-way will bring

00:43:32.821 --> 00:43:33.962
bad name to Him.

00:43:33.962 --> 00:43:39.192
Why not people who claim about Christ understand
that what others have to say about it? If

00:43:39.192 --> 00:43:43.022
you want to know about Christians, go and
ask the Jews; and if you want to know about

00:43:43.022 --> 00:43:47.881
the Jews, go and ask the Muslims; and if you
want to know about the Muslims, go and ask

00:43:47.881 --> 00:43:55.136
the Hindus. There are all in a doldrum. Nobody
has any understanding that they are worshiping

00:43:55.161 --> 00:44:02.987
or they are admiring or advocating a flower
which belongs to one tree of life. They have

00:44:03.012 --> 00:44:09.811
all plucked those flowers, “This is mine,
this is mine, in my pocket,” and fighting.

00:44:09.811 --> 00:44:17.606
If religion means fighting and quarreling,
it is not a religion at all. If it is integration,

00:44:17.631 --> 00:44:19.931
then it is a religion.

00:44:19.931 --> 00:44:26.252
In Sahaja Yoga you'll find that they are all
together. Christ has said, very clearly, “Those

00:44:26.252 --> 00:44:34.106
who are not against Me are with Me.” Who
are those people? Try to find out. For that

00:44:34.131 --> 00:44:40.192
you have to little bit go out of Bible. In
the Bible how much do you have Christ there,

00:44:40.192 --> 00:44:44.959
for three years? Nobody allowed Him to live
for three years, and if they could, they would

00:44:44.984 --> 00:44:46.998
also kill Me.

00:44:47.023 --> 00:44:53.232
Not easy, He wanted to play the drama, otherwise
He would have finished all of them, in no

00:44:53.232 --> 00:45:00.636
time. So He has said that “You are to be
resurrected first, and then that's how you

00:45:00.661 --> 00:45:01.431
will be judged.”

00:45:01.431 --> 00:45:08.032
And the Day of Judgment is today, this is
the Day of Judgment, that's why you are confused,

00:45:08.032 --> 00:45:11.881
this is the Day of Judgment where you will
be judged and how are you going to be judged?

00:45:11.881 --> 00:45:18.792
Through your Kundalini. Your Kundalini is
going to be awakened and you'll be judged

00:45:18.792 --> 00:45:23.736
where you are. That's what it is, and those
who will be calling Me, “Christ, Christ”

00:45:23.761 --> 00:45:29.442
I will not look at them, that's what it is.
By calling Him “Christ, Christ” you do

00:45:29.442 --> 00:45:36.391
not become Christians, you have to get your
Realization, your baptism in the actual sense.

00:45:36.391 --> 00:45:41.321
It has to be an actualization. I'm telling
you that if you miss the point, you have missed

00:45:41.321 --> 00:45:49.457
it for ever and ever. Be careful on that point.
It's very important. Don't run after things

00:45:49.482 --> 00:45:56.977
which have no meaning to your consciousness.
Try to raise yourself up to this point and

00:45:57.002 --> 00:46:02.631
understand that the time has come for you
to transform, this is the time of your judgment

00:46:02.631 --> 00:46:08.972
and you have to get to it in a very big way.
The shallow things and all this will be finished.

00:46:08.972 --> 00:46:15.962
What is America or what is any country in
the eyes of God? Nothing. If they do not take

00:46:15.962 --> 00:46:22.962
to His ways, all will be treated like waste,
thoroughly waste, it's a wasteland. But if

00:46:22.987 --> 00:46:31.497
you rise, thousands and thousands and millions
and millions can be saved. Try to rise, try

00:46:31.522 --> 00:46:36.492
to understand your own responsibilities, that
is very important.

00:46:36.492 --> 00:46:43.492
Today is the last day and the last center
which is the Sahasrara, is the integration,

00:46:43.532 --> 00:46:51.846
integration of your being, of physical, mental,
emotional being, it takes place. Is integration

00:46:51.871 --> 00:46:58.071
of all the Deities, of all the Prophets, all
the great works that they have done, integration

00:46:58.071 --> 00:47:05.136
of all the scriptures, everything takes places
when this Sahasrara is opened out, when you

00:47:05.161 --> 00:47:06.821
become the Spirit.

00:47:06.821 --> 00:47:11.891
This is a much more difficult job, I know,
because if you don't have to transform people

00:47:11.891 --> 00:47:18.472
it is very easy to talk about it and get away.
But I have to transform, not only transform

00:47:18.472 --> 00:47:25.866
but you have to become, you cannot become
a Sahaji Yogi by paying Me, by saying things,

00:47:25.891 --> 00:47:31.242
by arguing, by showing up, you can only become
Sahaji Yogi by going within yourself, face

00:47:31.242 --> 00:47:40.526
up to it, see for yourself. I am here to help
you in every way possible. Whatever is possible

00:47:40.551 --> 00:47:44.851
we'll try to do it, but you all should also
understand your responsibility.

00:47:44.851 --> 00:47:51.782
It is not a joke now, it’s no more a joke.
It's not like Sunday morning you get up and

00:47:51.782 --> 00:47:57.522
go to church, or Monday morning you go somewhere
else in the temple, and Tuesday morning you

00:47:57.522 --> 00:48:04.522
go to see Siddhivinayaka [Temple of Shri Ganesha
- SG] and another day you go to a mosque.

00:48:04.631 --> 00:48:09.061
It is not like that. It is a very serious
thing which we must understand. We are at

00:48:09.061 --> 00:48:15.462
the brink of destruction, be careful about
it. We must do things so that the blessings

00:48:15.462 --> 00:48:21.141
of God comes to upon us and that we are saved.
It is a very serious thing, and the responsibility

00:48:21.141 --> 00:48:29.306
is much more on all the people who are getting
Realization, so do not treat it lightly. You

00:48:29.331 --> 00:48:31.561
all, I hope, will take it seriously.

00:48:31.561 --> 00:48:38.977
Thank God there is a nice seminar we are having
after this for three days, you can come down

00:48:39.002 --> 00:48:44.212
there, they have charged you very little,
we don't have to make any profit of out you,

00:48:44.212 --> 00:48:49.292
the only profit I can make is that you get
your profits, that's all. So please take it

00:48:49.292 --> 00:48:55.061
up seriously, work it out seriously, and I
tell you, out of you will come out those people

00:48:55.061 --> 00:49:01.792
who will build that foundations of that construction
which is going to come. Please don't waste

00:49:01.792 --> 00:49:05.202
your time in useless things, get to it.

00:49:05.202 --> 00:49:12.202
Any one of you can do it. I bless you with
My whole heart and know that I love you very

00:49:12.222 --> 00:49:17.442
much. If you have any problems, you can write
to Me, but don't write to Me about your family

00:49:17.442 --> 00:49:21.512
problems and this and that, it's a headache
to Me, there is no need to write. Of course

00:49:21.512 --> 00:49:25.651
I'm a mother, if you have problems you can
write but some people write ten pages saying,

00:49:25.651 --> 00:49:31.101
“my wife is fighting me.” It's bit too
much. You should write to Me about the problems

00:49:31.101 --> 00:49:37.091
which concern the whole country, concern the
whole world. Widen yourself and that’s how,

00:49:37.091 --> 00:49:43.621
though you may think that you are very unassuming
simple people, you are the ones who are going

00:49:43.621 --> 00:49:48.141
to be, not those who are successful, they
are blinded by their success; not those who

00:49:48.141 --> 00:49:52.772
are rich, they are not going to enter into
the Kingdom of God; not those who have a big

00:49:52.797 --> 00:49:58.196
name, no. It's you, you are going to enter
into the Kingdom of God

00:49:58.221 --> 00:50:00.648
May God bless you.

00:51:14.692 --> 00:51:21.692
[Self Realization]

00:53:09.329 --> 00:53:16.329
Now, all the angels have a seat, now, put
your hands towards Me like this, and close

00:53:16.472 --> 00:53:20.962
your eyes, the vibrations are so much today,
nothing to do. Just so much vibrations tonight,

00:53:20.962 --> 00:53:27.792
it's tremendous. Just close your eyes, you'll
feel the cool breeze, most of you, close your

00:53:27.801 --> 00:53:31.581
eyes please.

00:53:43.311 --> 00:53:50.311
You just put your right hand on the head and
see if there is a cool breeze coming out,

00:53:51.765 --> 00:53:56.992
little higher, on top of your head.

00:53:57.017 --> 00:54:04.017
Hmm, it’s there. Now put your right hand
towards Me and put the left hand and see,

00:54:04.042 --> 00:54:37.754
little higher, about six inches higher, six
inches higher, change over, again, now put

00:54:37.779 --> 00:54:43.748
your hands up like this absolutely, close
the eyes and ask, “Is this the breeze of

00:54:43.773 --> 00:54:54.741
the Holy Ghost” or ask the question “Mother,
are You the Holy Ghost?

00:55:06.689 --> 00:55:16.706
You feel the cool breeze? Good, it's tremendous
today. May God bless you all.

00:55:17.184 --> 00:55:33.808
Those who have not felt any cool breeze, please
raise your hands. One, two and three. Are

00:55:33.833 --> 00:55:43.509
keeping all right? You are not well? All right,
doesn't matter, if you are not well maybe

00:55:43.534 --> 00:55:49.033
you may not feel today but you'll get well
and then you'll feel it, so it doesn't matter.

00:55:49.058 --> 00:55:54.260
There's one or two persons who have not felt
it, it’s so tremendous today, May God bless

00:55:54.285 --> 00:55:56.223
you.

00:55:57.093 --> 00:56:03.134
You may give your addresses to these people,
let them know where you are, also you can

00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:09.481
take address for the seminar, if you want
to come, they are going to arrange a transport

00:56:09.506 --> 00:56:17.240
for you to go to Santa Cruz. Thank you very
much.

00:56:17.265 --> 00:56:22.912
I say goodbye to you, after a year I’ll
definitely will come to Los Angeles again,

00:56:22.937 --> 00:56:28.748
those who haven't cool breeze should keep
their hands raised. These boys will come and

00:56:28.773 --> 00:56:32.254
see you. All right, those people who haven't
got it, please keep your hands slightly raised

00:56:32.279 --> 00:56:37.334
so some people will come and see you, little
higher so that they'll come and see you. Here

00:56:37.359 --> 00:56:39.088
just have a look.

00:56:39.113 --> 00:56:43.338
Man in the Audience: I didn’t hear Your
last question. I didn’t understand what

00:56:43.363 --> 00:56:44.719
You asked about the Holy Ghost.

00:56:44.744 --> 00:56:49.874
Shri Mataji: Just to know that I am the Holy
Ghost.

00:56:49.899 --> 00:56:52.895
Man in the Audience: You are Holy Ghost?

00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.265
Shri Mataji: Yes. Otherwise how will you recognize?

00:56:55.290 --> 00:56:57.267
Man in the Audience: The Bible says that God
is the Holy Ghost.

00:56:57.292 --> 00:57:04.319
Shri Mataji: Bible never says that. You don’t
understand that. You don’t teach Me Bible.

00:57:04.344 --> 00:57:11.344
[Man keeps interrupting Shri Mataji] It doesn’t
say. You don’t tell Me. You have no knowledge.

00:57:14.603 --> 00:57:19.903
Don’t disturb others. If you are such a
good person you ...
