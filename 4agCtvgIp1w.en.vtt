00:00:21.186 --> 00:00:28.776
Yogi Mahajan: Today's heinous(Dark Age) Kaliyuga
can also be the era of a new Yoga.

00:00:29.052 --> 00:00:38.852
This was predicted five thousand years
ago by Bhrigu Muni in the Nadi Grantha

00:00:39.075 --> 00:00:52.685
that a great Incarnation will be coming
in the year 1970, through which a very
simple yoga will come.

00:00:53.332 --> 00:01:00.932
And the meditation(sadhana) of all the
seekers will be completed through it.

00:01:01.123 --> 00:01:08.843
This is evident from the life of
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi,

00:01:08.848 --> 00:01:19.238
That She is that Incarnation, and Her
Sahaja Yoga, is what Bhrigu Muni
must have told about.

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:30.166
In 1970, Shri Mataji started the
work of Sahaja Yoga and now it
has spread all over the world.

00:01:31.648 --> 00:01:39.558
In countries like Russia, thousands
have become Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:39.711 --> 00:01:44.107
And it is spreading from place to place.

00:01:44.515 --> 00:01:52.225
This Sahaja Yoga is very simple;
every householder can practice it.

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:59.179
It doesn't cost any money and doesn't
require leaving the home.

00:02:00.078 --> 00:02:09.718
This new yoga that has come, has come
for this terrible Kaliyuga, when
amidst so many difficulties

00:02:10.111 --> 00:02:14.591
man can attain a self-realization.

00:02:14.694 --> 00:02:26.614
As it is Shri Mataji is a homemaker
and has children too, but to get to
know Shri Mataji,

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:38.536
we have to attain Self-realization,
and when we feel this cool breeze
in our hands,

00:02:38.871 --> 00:02:44.731
then we will understand who Shri Mataji is.

00:02:44.731 --> 00:02:53.853
Come, let's know the Power from Whom
this cool breeze is blowing.

00:02:53.853 --> 00:03:03.142
Your Holiness Shri Mataji, on December
the 20th, there was a huge Sahaja Yoga
program at Shivaji Park,

00:03:03.142 --> 00:03:13.458
in which fifty thousand people had
an experience of cool breeze on
their hands and heads.

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:20.738
And later they told that they felt
very peaceful and light.

00:03:21.045 --> 00:03:30.425
It is quite surprising that a crowd of
50,000 people could have such an
experience instantly.

00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:39.248
This has never happened in the history
of spirituality, so was this Your miracle?

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:51.559
Shri Mataji: Ordinarily people would
call this a miracle, but otherwise
it is something special.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.100
Because this is going to happen in
Kaliyuga, was described by Bhrigu
Muni thousands of years ago.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.593
In his book Nadi Granth, he wrote that
the Kundalini of thousands of people
would awaken spontaneously.

00:04:07.083 --> 00:04:12.953
And even that if you completely
translate the dates he gave

00:04:12.958 --> 00:04:20.088
into your own dates, it is clearly
written that Sahaja Yoga will start
from the year 1970.

00:04:20.645 --> 00:04:29.415
And according to that, Sahaja Yoga
actually started in the year 1970.

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:38.639
Now it is like this that it is the dark
age of Kaliyuga and this is going to
happen in the dark age of Kaliyuga,

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:45.550
He had predicted this, but even more
than that prediction, I think that

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.785
he didn't say anything about it
happening all over the world.

00:04:49.785 --> 00:04:56.841
So I see this happening everywhere,
and this thing certainly seems amazing

00:04:56.841 --> 00:05:03.195
that those people who have never even
heard the name of God, who have always
been deprived of their culture,

00:05:03.195 --> 00:05:09.229
in this state also these people attain
Sahaja so easily.

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:16.178
Many people have described this, that
is, all the saints and sages in our
Maharashtra have described it.

00:05:16.178 --> 00:05:24.820
Gyaneshwarji has done it. And it has
been described in Punjab by Guru Nanak
Sahib and Guru Govind Sahib.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.460
Similarly, Kabir has spoken about
it very openly.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:34.533
But because he said in poetry, is
why people don't understand.

00:05:34.692 --> 00:05:40.932
And especially Guru Nanak Sahib has
told us that such a time will come.

00:05:41.006 --> 00:05:51.456
Similarly, it is written in the Quran
that when the time of Qiyamah comes,
thousands of people will become saints
in this way.

00:05:51.848 --> 00:06:02.248
Then Christ has also said, because the
Revelation of John, he has written that
such an event will happen.

00:06:02.591 --> 00:06:08.321
Then if seen, because of all the
religions, I am not surprised.

00:06:08.423 --> 00:06:12.413
Yogi Mahajan: Shri Mataji, please
tell how does one get this power.

00:06:12.413 --> 00:06:15.568
Shri Mataji: It may please be understood
that the One who created us,

00:06:15.609 --> 00:06:19.579
call Him by whatever name you like
—call Him by the name of God,

00:06:20.053 --> 00:06:24.713
He has already made all these
arrangements within us.

00:06:24.796 --> 00:06:31.146
And in medical terms, it can be said
that it is the Parasympathetic Nervous
System, which becomes activated.

00:06:31.248 --> 00:06:35.808
Because these seven chakras that
have been told about, mainly

00:06:35.808 --> 00:06:44.442
These seven chakras operate the
plexuses within us

00:06:44.442 --> 00:06:50.178
only on the part of the body. But in
the mind, in the intellect, they are
manifested(implemented) in every way.

00:06:50.178 --> 00:07:00.454
You can know that these chakras are
within us when you are completely
in that state in Sahaj.

00:07:00.488 --> 00:07:04.068
Then you can also recognize on
your fingers

00:07:04.068 --> 00:07:10.075
that which of your chakras are bad
and which chakras are not functioning
properly in others.

00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:19.181
Now the point is that whatever is
Indian is useless, and whatever is
foreign is good.

00:07:19.181 --> 00:07:23.438
It's very wrong to think that only
they have complete knowledge.

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:31.854
Because now Western scientists have
said that having an IQ won't suffice -

00:07:31.854 --> 00:07:36.450
should have EQ too. Meaning that
there should also be emotional
coefficence in balance.

00:07:36.450 --> 00:07:41.075
So it is believed in Sahaja Yoga that
first balance should come within you.

00:07:41.075 --> 00:07:48.236
And after that, whatever benefits come
from the awakening of Kundalini, those
are your birthright.

00:07:48.236 --> 00:07:52.894
Yogi Mahajan: Shri Mataji many of the
people who came there, didn't know
about Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:52.894 --> 00:07:58.263
or didn't know anything about spirituality.
So can everyone get this thing?

00:07:58.263 --> 00:08:05.203
Shri Mataji: Why not? What such sins
did human beings commit, and what
is their plight,

00:08:05.203 --> 00:08:07.322
that we think such is not the condition.

00:08:07.322 --> 00:08:11.936
Because I see, wherever I go,
whether in India or abroad,

00:08:12.231 --> 00:08:20.551
this thing we think we have sinned,
or this and that, is also a way of
torturing ourselves.

00:08:20.551 --> 00:08:27.895
The other is, a way of torturing others.
But if you look at it realistically, then
within this Kundalini is fully formed.

00:08:27.895 --> 00:08:32.454
Yogi Mahajan: Shri Mataji there came from
(UNCLEAR) and among them

00:08:32.454 --> 00:08:38.233
about 200 Russians were also there,
where there was no knowledge of God.

00:08:38.233 --> 00:08:42.083
So how are such people told about
Sahaja Yoga?

00:08:42.083 --> 00:08:44.524
Shri Mataji: No one has known much
about God.

00:08:44.524 --> 00:08:50.479
But here religion is a hypocrisy.
Elsewhere also religion is a hypocrisy,

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:56.109
like Catholics, or you see people of
other castes, there are Muslims,

00:08:56.109 --> 00:09:00.476
they're all just ostentatious. What have
they achieved? No one has achieved anything.

00:09:00.804 --> 00:09:07.824
And these Russian people are absolutely
clean plates, absolutely clean people.

00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:13.790
It's good they didn't know anything.
That's why sometimes I think atheists
are better than these believers.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:21.640
Yogi Mahajan: It has been reported
that Sahaja Yoga is spreading in
80-90 countries and

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:27.195
no money is charged for such a large
event which is happening.

00:09:27.195 --> 00:09:30.113
So how does this work happen?

00:09:30.595 --> 00:09:34.825
Shri Mataji: May not be 80-90, but
yes, I have never ever counted.

00:09:34.825 --> 00:09:41.339
But one thing is there, that in the
beginning, I used to travel to nearby
countries using My own money.

00:09:41.915 --> 00:09:47.105
Had some money, My husband also
gave Me money, but I used to go.

00:09:47.105 --> 00:09:50.950
I Myself used to book the halls and
do the work – in the beginning.

00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:56.109
After that, these people started
feeling embarassed, that, "Mother
comes to give us Self-realization,"

00:09:56.109 --> 00:10:00.967
"And we get Self-realization at Her
expense, so that is not proper."

00:10:01.397 --> 00:10:08.497
Then they said, "No, we ourselves
will pay money to whichever
country You go to."

00:10:08.497 --> 00:10:14.230
So only Sahaja Yogis used to collect
money. Money is not collected from
anywhere else outside.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:20.997
Yogi Mahajan: Have come to know from
many people that many diseases can
be cured through Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:20.997 --> 00:10:26.068
So is it true that all this work
can be done without any medicine?

00:10:26.068 --> 00:10:31.544
Shri Mataji: Yes, absolutely through
this Power because this Power is the
One which is spread all around.

00:10:31.544 --> 00:10:39.287
This is the Power of God's infinite
love. This Power is a reflection
of that within us.

00:10:39.287 --> 00:10:44.766
And when This achieves oneness with It,
then as if a connection is made,
yoga takes place.

00:10:44.937 --> 00:10:52.697
Then as many kinds of various energies
that are, flow through it within.

00:10:52.697 --> 00:10:56.963
She corrects these chakras because
due to the chakras being spoilt,

00:10:56.963 --> 00:11:03.565
All diseases, mental problems, and
not only these, even intellectual
problems such as

00:11:03.565 --> 00:11:08.640
what should be called ego and
beyond that, spiritual problems,

00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:13.473
which have come because of false
people, all those are destroyed.

00:11:13.473 --> 00:11:19.627
Because this Kundalini that is, when
It rises from Its place, then while
passing through these chakras,

00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:24.673
It illuminates them and fills them,
meaning, nourishes them.

00:11:24.673 --> 00:11:28.566
And it connects them together
—it integrates the human being.

00:11:28.566 --> 00:11:32.195
There is no confusion in him that
his mind is thinking one thing,

00:11:32.195 --> 00:11:37.117
his heart is thinking about something else;
it doesn't happen that way. Many, many
things are obtained from this.

00:11:37.117 --> 00:11:45.909
The greatest thing I think is that
your attention that is, it becomes
connected to God.

00:11:45.909 --> 00:11:51.117
Because of it being enlightened,
wherever you put your attention,
that work gets done.

00:11:51.117 --> 00:11:54.419
And because of this attention being
absolutely calm,

00:11:54.419 --> 00:12:00.652
this talk of yours about world peace from
the outside, that takes place (from) within.

00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:08.875
Yogi Mahajan: Through this power, can
the problem of food etc in our country
be solved?

00:12:08.875 --> 00:12:12.057
Shri Mataji: It has a huge impact, a
huge impact can come

00:12:12.057 --> 00:12:16.230
Because everything works out due to this
consciousness. We people don't even think

00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:21.228
that from where does this Mother Earth
produce these different kinds of flowers
and fruits?

00:12:21.228 --> 00:12:23.132
We don't even think about this.

00:12:23.132 --> 00:12:27.939
We just think that all this is our right-
not that it's coming from the Mother Earth.

00:12:27.939 --> 00:12:34.987
But when you put these vibrations
on a seed or a tree,

00:12:34.987 --> 00:12:41.893
or if you put on flowers, I've seen it
produces ten times more.

00:12:41.893 --> 00:12:44.140
Ten times more and better stuff.

00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.627
People told Me that basmati couldn't
be grown here. I said, "Okay, bring
basmati."

00:12:48.627 --> 00:12:56.741
When I put vibrations on to the Basmati,
then it produced ten times more.
Such huge sunflowers bloomed.

00:12:56.741 --> 00:13:00.603
The sunflower turned out to be so huge.
Showed it to the collector and was
published in the newspaper.

00:13:00.603 --> 00:13:03.569
You should go and see at the homes
of our Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:03.569 --> 00:13:07.837
go and see their fields, so their
fields are lush green.

00:13:07.837 --> 00:13:11.202
Not only that, the vegetables that
are grown at their places are
completely different.

00:13:11.202 --> 00:13:15.278
And then they don't take hybrid seeds -
non-hybrid.

00:13:15.278 --> 00:13:22.654
By purchasing hybrid seeds, you
become a slave to any hybrid seed
manufacturing company.

00:13:22.654 --> 00:13:25.273
But these are non-hybrid seeds.

00:13:25.273 --> 00:13:32.966
Not only this, when we experimented
on the cows here, we saw that they

00:13:32.966 --> 00:13:40.871
give no less milk than the cows from
abroad, but their milk is very pure.

00:13:40.871 --> 00:13:46.787
Those who drink milk of cows from
abroad - then, an experiment was done
on foreign cows also and it was seen,

00:13:46.787 --> 00:13:52.274
that they are absentminded. They
don't understand anything. They
are somewhat strange.

00:13:52.274 --> 00:13:55.424
If they are walking on the road, they
don't even realize that a car is
coming from the front.

00:13:55.424 --> 00:13:58.747
They continue giving milk even if
their child dies.

00:13:58.747 --> 00:14:02.326
They have no feelings from within at all.
The meaning is that

00:14:02.326 --> 00:14:06.154
Their EQ is absolutely zero.
And their IQ is also zero.

00:14:06.154 --> 00:14:12.135
By drinking the milk of such people,
such cows, our condition is the same
– what's the benefit?

00:14:12.382 --> 00:14:18.892
So all these things can change, and
this Divine thing, Its blessings,

00:14:18.892 --> 00:14:25.833
can be had for this country in a
special way, because this country
is the land of Yoga.

00:14:25.833 --> 00:14:31.235
Many great people have lived here
and they have shed their blood here.

00:14:31.235 --> 00:14:33.780
We are going to get the blessings
of all that today.

00:14:35.431 --> 00:14:39.511
Yogi Mahajan: Shri Mataji, by Your
Grace we are going to receive
Its blessings,

00:14:39.828 --> 00:14:50.138
but seeing the deteriorating situation
of the country, can these politicians
also be set right through this?

00:14:50.138 --> 00:14:55.585
Shri Mataji: Yes, if there is a change
in them. If they come to Sahaja, then
there is absolutely a solution.

00:14:55.714 --> 00:15:04.664
And either those people who have been
transformed, who are now established in
this, you should put them in politics.

00:15:04.664 --> 00:15:09.126
I have no interest in, no concern with
politics, and neither does Sahaja Yoga have.

00:15:09.126 --> 00:15:15.983
But those who have become Sahaja Yogis
are a special kind of people, you
should put them in politics.

00:15:15.983 --> 00:15:22.764
And I can claim that whatever they do
will be a wonderfully special experience.

00:15:22.764 --> 00:15:29.947
They have patriotism, they are absolutely
(UNCLEAR) for the country and the Truth,
they are very (UNCLEAR)

00:15:29.947 --> 00:15:36.361
They are old PEOPLE who know their country
(UNCLEAR - boundary of?) and they keep
drawing My attention,

00:15:36.361 --> 00:15:41.329
"Mother, look at this, the plight of
the children here, the plight of the
women here,"

00:15:41.329 --> 00:15:44.646
"Something must be done for this,
something must be done for the poor."

00:15:44.646 --> 00:15:51.034
According to caste here, this is wrong.
This is why all the problem has arisen
- based on caste.

00:15:51.034 --> 00:15:58.001
It should have been that attention
should have been paid where there are
the poor. Like, as we say, the have-nots.

00:15:58.001 --> 00:16:00.070
First should have looked towards
(paid attention to) them.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:04.525
They have created castes uselessly
and divided the country.

00:16:04.525 --> 00:16:11.723
Similarly, Gandhiji's secularism,
'Sarva Dharma Samanatvam'(Equality of
All Religions) which Gandhiji believed in,

00:16:11.723 --> 00:16:18.816
the approach was different. He said
that all people should believe in
all religions.

00:16:18.816 --> 00:16:26.757
And just as we believe in the people of
our place similarly we should believe
in the great people of other places.

00:16:26.757 --> 00:16:32.178
If you read his prayers, they are
all written on the Kundalini.

00:16:32.178 --> 00:16:38.286
And there are Christian prayers in it,
and Buddhist prayers.

00:16:38.286 --> 00:16:44.402
He also quoted verses from the Quran
of Muslims - so he used to say that
you will have to do all this.

00:16:44.402 --> 00:16:49.679
It's not that you believe in one religion,
but you believe in all religions. And
that's what happens in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:49.679 --> 00:16:54.841
You come from any religion and then
you start believing in all the
religions in reality.

00:16:54.841 --> 00:16:59.289
You start believing in reality,
not in falsehood.

00:16:59.289 --> 00:17:01.567
When this will happen, then who
will fight?

00:17:01.567 --> 00:17:07.133
And the greatest thing is that you
automatically develop a sense of
collectivity, 'collective consciousness'.

00:17:07.133 --> 00:17:10.639
When this collectivity comes into you,
then who is the other?

00:17:10.639 --> 00:17:14.156
With whom will you fight when
everyone knows the same thing?

00:17:14.156 --> 00:17:18.982
Because you know the Absolute Truth;
Not that you have created from your mind -
Absolute Truth.

00:17:18.982 --> 00:17:23.327
After knowing the Only Truth, why
would you fight?

00:17:23.327 --> 00:17:26.182
Everyone is seeing the same thing,
then why would there be a fight,
why would there be a quarrel?

00:17:26.451 --> 00:17:34.861
As it is the time has come for
everything to end, but people
should have recognition of this.

00:17:34.861 --> 00:17:40.420
I've seen in many places that those were
people saying, "No, no, we don't believe
in one religion, we don't believe in one
world religion."

00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.458
"This shouldn't happen. We want
different religions." Because then
how will the fighting happen?

00:17:44.835 --> 00:17:51.355
If the general public becomes aware of
this, then all this is bound to change.

00:17:51.355 --> 00:17:57.048
And the gift of this God Who has
created this entire universe also
has to be made golden.

00:17:57.048 --> 00:18:02.143
Because He only says that, "Just
come into My kingdom" - He doesn't
want anything else.

00:18:02.143 --> 00:18:06.212
(UNCLEAR) Hasn't told any such thing.
- There is no need for this.

00:18:06.212 --> 00:18:11.712
You have this power within you. You've
already done all this. It's over. There's
no need to do it again in this lifetime.

00:18:12.401 --> 00:18:16.431
Yogi Mahajan: Shri Mataji, many people
say that this is blind faith.

00:18:17.206 --> 00:18:24.116
Shri Mataji: Not of many, but a few.
Because they themselves are blind
and unscriptural, are unscientific.

00:18:24.116 --> 00:18:28.971
If you say anything about anything,

00:18:28.971 --> 00:18:34.700
So we should search for it first. We
must find out that what is this thing.

00:18:34.753 --> 00:18:40.183
It's not like that, 'We'll give You
two lakh rupees if You prove it.'

00:18:40.183 --> 00:18:45.568
Then I can never awaken your Kundalini
even if you give Me not just two lakhs
but thousands of lakhs.

00:18:45.568 --> 00:18:48.022
The Kundalini will not be awakened
by that.

00:18:48.022 --> 00:18:52.131
If there's humility in you and if you
desire it, then only can it happen.

00:18:52.131 --> 00:18:59.722
What will happen by talking like
this is, that what is the Truth,
will move away from people.

00:18:59.722 --> 00:19:06.673
Like this, even believing in God
is blind faith. Even loving in one's
country is blind faith.

00:19:06.673 --> 00:19:12.937
All these kinds of emotions are present
within us. Just as we have the Kundalini
within us, so too

00:19:12.937 --> 00:19:19.696
love for the country, love for one's
mother, love for one's father, all
these are religions within oneself.

00:19:19.696 --> 00:19:25.645
And man acts according to this dharma.
Why do we love our parents so much?

00:19:25.645 --> 00:19:31.823
Why do we? It's a belief—not because
they've done something for us or done
good for us.

00:19:31.823 --> 00:19:39.780
In all this there's a dharma and in
the same way, loving the country is
also a religion within us.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.083
And the biggest religion is that we
have to achieve ourselves, we have
to attain Self-realization.

00:19:45.083 --> 00:19:49.746
So people come for this - after all
why do I need to do this?

00:19:49.746 --> 00:19:56.994
Well, look, I don't need anything.
By God's Grace, I am very happy.

00:19:56.994 --> 00:20:01.097
I have children, have everything, so
by this blind faith what do I get?

00:20:01.097 --> 00:20:04.920
I don't want to go into politics.
What's the benefit of doing this?

00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:11.603
This they should think, at the age of 73,
I travel around the world, so is there
benefit in doing this?

00:20:11.603 --> 00:20:15.654
Do people pay Me, give nothing.
I am doing all the work for free.

00:20:15.654 --> 00:20:20.532
As for example I'll tell you something,
I said there are so many chakras
inside you – come on –

00:20:20.532 --> 00:20:27.521
and the roots of these chakras is in
your brain. Immediately they -
there's a huge place of Science,

00:20:27.521 --> 00:20:31.655
as Novashipir, the scientists there
immediately put it on their machines.

00:20:31.655 --> 00:20:38.287
And he told people who were Sahaja Yogis,
"Okay, you pay attention to each chakra,"

00:20:38.287 --> 00:20:43.388
Meaning, we give such bandhan like this,
give bandhan. The chakra on which they
gave bandhan,

00:20:43.388 --> 00:20:48.279
Light appeared where I had told.
Therefore, you should know that

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:52.490
even doctors in America have started
to believe that Sahaja Yoga is
something special.

00:20:52.490 --> 00:20:57.603
And in Australia they have created
a chamber for Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:57.603 --> 00:21:00.760
Yogi Mahajan: Shri Mataji, thank You very,
very much.

00:21:01.509 --> 00:21:08.959
Please give our audience the knowledge
of Sahaja Yoga and Self-Realization
if You think it's okay.

00:21:08.959 --> 00:21:13.036
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, why not. I did
it once in Hong Kong, and it benefitted
a lot of people.

00:21:13.036 --> 00:21:15.104
Many people should benefit from
Self-realization.

00:21:15.104 --> 00:21:17.416
First of all, there can be no compulsion
in this.

00:21:17.416 --> 00:21:20.861
If someone says, "Give me to Self-Realization
compulsurily," then it cannot happen.

00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:25.526
Those who are seeking Self-realization,
they should humbly have this pure desire
within them,

00:21:25.526 --> 00:21:29.286
That I may get realization. Understood,
it doesn't cost anything.

00:21:29.286 --> 00:21:31.367
You can't sell this, nothing.

00:21:31.367 --> 00:21:36.939
But the other thing is that those of you
who consider yourselves sinners,

00:21:36.939 --> 00:21:39.992
and you are fasting and doing penance,
stop all this.

00:21:39.992 --> 00:21:44.447
I don't believe you are sinners. A Mother
never considers her children sinners.

00:21:44.584 --> 00:21:54.204
So it's a thing that you forgive yourself.
And the other thing is that you forgive
others too.

00:21:54.204 --> 00:21:56.876
Because you forgive, (or) you don't,
you don't do anything.

00:21:56.876 --> 00:22:00.153
Except that you are torturing yourself
and playing into the hands of others.

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:02.631
So you forgive others as well, it's
very important, because this chakra
of Agnya is,

00:22:02.631 --> 00:22:08.987
it's (stuck)in place like this and it's very
difficult to open it.

00:22:08.987 --> 00:22:14.077
If you forgive everyone and forgive
yourself, then it will open up like this.

00:22:14.077 --> 00:22:17.496
By forgiving yourself, the chakra
of this place,

00:22:17.496 --> 00:22:22.089
due to which angina and many other diseases
are caused, they will be cured.

00:22:22.313 --> 00:22:26.093
So those who are watching at this time,
they may place their hands towards
Me like this.

00:22:26.093 --> 00:22:28.381
Believe Me, then it happens in a moment.

00:22:28.381 --> 00:22:34.975
Just as you put a seed in the womb of
Mother Earth, then it sprouts on its own.

00:22:34.975 --> 00:22:38.964
In the same way, your Kundalini awakens.
Now you don't have to make any effort.

00:22:38.964 --> 00:22:41.788
Don't have to say any mantra, place both
your hands towards Me in absolute silence.

00:22:42.481 --> 00:22:47.441
Now you bend your neck and put
your left hand towards Me.

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:54.630
And right hand you keep on your palate,
because there's a soft, soft bone in
your childhood.

00:22:55.187 --> 00:22:59.877
On top of it a little above, keep
it raised, not touching the head.

00:22:59.887 --> 00:23:07.287
And see whether from within you, some,
or from the fontanel bone area,
which is called the Brahmarandhra,

00:23:07.833 --> 00:23:16.667
some cool like or warm air is coming
out of your palate?

00:23:16.667 --> 00:23:21.554
For some far away, some spread out,
some closeby,

00:23:21.554 --> 00:23:27.482
In this way, this power, which is
the Kundalini within you, that
has awakened.

00:23:27.482 --> 00:23:29.845
Kabir Das ji has described it
very beautifully.

00:23:29.845 --> 00:23:33.025
Now place both your hands towards
Me and look at Me.

00:23:33.291 --> 00:23:38.121
And try to become thoughtless, because
the first state is thoughtless samadhi
(awareness).

00:23:38.121 --> 00:23:42.448
Because whenever thoughts arise, they
are limited; have to go beyond them,
rise above them.

00:23:43.183 --> 00:23:46.423
Now raise both hands above your
head and tilt your head back.

00:23:46.423 --> 00:23:48.922
Ask the question, "Mother, is this
the Paramchaitanya?"

00:23:48.922 --> 00:23:52.402
If you are a Christian ask, "Is this
the cool breeze of the Holy ghost?

00:23:52.572 --> 00:23:54.472
(UNCLEAR)

00:23:54.472 --> 00:23:59.661
And ask that, "Is this the All-Pervading
Power of God's love?"

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:02.260
Ask. First of all you feel it.

00:24:02.338 --> 00:24:10.118
A cool wave will emerge. You will feel
it. Now, you please lower your hands.

00:24:10.704 --> 00:24:14.654
Those who have it in their hands or
[UNCLEAR - Head?] (UNCLEAR) they
should inform.

00:24:14.655 --> 00:24:17.595
This for you (UNCLEAR) your troubles
will go away

00:24:17.595 --> 00:24:22.675
And a day should come when the world
comes to you seeking this spirituality.

00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:27.280
Infinite blessings to all of you.
With love, I bless you all!
