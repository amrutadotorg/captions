1
00:00:06,509 --> 00:00:09,416
Shakti Puja, Togliatti (Russia), 3 August 1993.

2
00:00:09,617 --> 00:00:15,730
Today it is such a great day for our Being,

3
00:00:15,930 --> 00:00:22,145
to be with you all again this year.

4
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:43,701
It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance.

5
00:00:53,267 --> 00:01:00,853
Today we have decided to have a Puja of Shakti that is the power,

6
00:01:01,053 --> 00:01:05,201
that is the Devi.

7
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:27,575
You know within us there are many powers

8
00:01:27,775 --> 00:01:35,689
of Maha Kali, Maha Saraswati, Maha Lakshmi, Kundalini.

9
00:01:46,572 --> 00:01:54,223
All these powers are there for us to ascent.

10
00:02:23,115 --> 00:02:32,512
If these powers are properly used and understood,

11
00:02:32,712 --> 00:02:39,572
then your ascent can be permanent.

12
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:51,688
Once you achieve your ascent

13
00:02:51,888 --> 00:02:55,461
and enter into the kingdom of God,

14
00:02:55,661 --> 00:03:00,294
all these powers get enlightened.

15
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:15,732
And these powers which are enlightened

16
00:03:15,932 --> 00:03:24,096
are absolutely filled with Love.

17
00:03:34,182 --> 00:03:38,722
Enlightenment, we have to understand that

18
00:03:38,922 --> 00:03:44,086
we get completely enlightened by Love.

19
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:55,385
So after enlightenment, after realisation,

20
00:03:55,585 --> 00:04:01,679
we use only one power which is of Love.

21
00:04:10,138 --> 00:04:16,872
Shri Rama had two sons: one was Lav and one was Kush.

22
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:26,742
One of them, Lav, came to Russia.

23
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:34,265
That’s why you are called as Slavs, means ‘with love’.

24
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:50,241
So Russian people are already quite full of their heart with love.

25
00:04:55,645 --> 00:05:01,258
But once you get your enlightenment

26
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:06,430
you realise that your love becomes

27
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:13,559
a beautiful ocean of joy for yourself.

28
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:31,400
This love is not the same which you had before enlightenment.

29
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:46,386
It’s transformed into a new dimension, into a new form.

30
00:05:48,707 --> 00:05:53,640
Before enlightenment you are attached to yourself,

31
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,765
first of all, very much: to your body, to your mind,

32
00:05:57,965 --> 00:06:04,077
to your conditionings, to your intellect, to your ego.

33
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:16,757
And that is how you develop

34
00:06:16,957 --> 00:06:24,978
darkness of many horrible things within yourself.

35
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:32,513
If you are too much attached to your body,

36
00:06:32,713 --> 00:06:35,760
then you may eat too much or you may not eat at all

37
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:38,899
or you may exercise too much

38
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:46,913
or you may work it out for a particular form of your figure.

39
00:06:57,996 --> 00:07:02,632
And you will use your body for absolutely wrong things

40
00:07:02,832 --> 00:07:07,035
or sinful things also.

41
00:07:11,638 --> 00:07:15,032
But then you become enlightened

42
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:21,301
and you understand that your body is the temple of God.

43
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:34,442
Then you keep your body clean and also you try to avoid

44
00:07:34,642 --> 00:07:39,892
all that is destructive for your body.

45
00:07:48,255 --> 00:07:53,014
The another attachment we have is very limited,

46
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:57,515
say for your own family, for your children, for your wife,

47
00:07:57,715 --> 00:08:02,361
for your husband, something like that.

48
00:08:10,736 --> 00:08:15,501
Despite that a human being can be extremely selfish

49
00:08:15,702 --> 00:08:18,294
and could only bother about himself

50
00:08:18,494 --> 00:08:23,759
and first of all him and then the rest.

51
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:37,563
Also he may spoil his children or spoil her husband

52
00:08:37,763 --> 00:08:46,914
or his wife in any way just to pamper their ego.

53
00:08:58,857 --> 00:09:03,891
Some people might indulge into alcoholism

54
00:09:04,091 --> 00:09:08,340
or drugs or all kinds of things.

55
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:21,441
Also to help their families they may draw other people,

56
00:09:28,392 --> 00:09:34,712
because they are very self-centered and their vision is very narrow.

57
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:43,430
Sometimes they discover that for those people for whom

58
00:09:43,631 --> 00:09:50,818
they are doing wrong things, are not actually bother about them.

59
00:09:59,340 --> 00:10:04,218
Then there’s enlightenment and they see for themselves

60
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:07,452
that whatever I’m doing is neither good for me

61
00:10:07,652 --> 00:10:12,200
nor for my family, nor my relations.

62
00:10:22,127 --> 00:10:27,174
After enlightenment you think collectively.

63
00:10:29,845 --> 00:10:33,809
Also when you think about your wife and your children,

64
00:10:34,009 --> 00:10:39,689
your family, you think what is the right thing for them to do.

65
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:52,891
Immediately you become attentive to their problems

66
00:10:53,091 --> 00:10:57,177
and to their destructiveness.

67
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:11,802
Then this power of love changes the whole atmosphere.

68
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:19,653
In the family people see how sacrificing you are

69
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:23,977
and how noble you are.

70
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:38,084
This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis.

71
00:11:42,834 --> 00:11:47,706
In that noble understanding of life

72
00:11:47,906 --> 00:11:56,669
they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family

73
00:11:56,869 --> 00:12:02,220
and try to bring them to the right path.

74
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:19,358
At the same time when they are helping their families

75
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:25,359
and try to improve their understanding,

76
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,704
they can be also very particular as to see that

77
00:12:31,928 --> 00:12:41,655
they do not allow over indulgence into their family.

78
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:55,391
Because of the enlightenment, there’s detachment.

79
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:04,764
And the power of detached love is the greatest.

80
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:12,202
It’s like the sap in the trees which rises from the Mother Earth,

81
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:17,429
goes up into the smallest of leaves

82
00:13:17,629 --> 00:13:24,272
and then it is either evaporated or goes back to the Mother Earth.

83
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:38,184
It doesn’t stay in one flower

84
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:45,770
because it likes it or in one leaf because it likes it.

85
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:56,586
It nourishes every part of the tree, whatever is need,

86
00:13:56,786 --> 00:14:01,107
and is not attached.

87
00:14:05,969 --> 00:14:12,996
But supposing it gets entangled or involved in one flower

88
00:14:13,196 --> 00:14:16,684
or in one leaf, the tree will die

89
00:14:16,884 --> 00:14:21,712
and that leaf and that flower will also die.

90
00:14:29,673 --> 00:14:37,501
So detached love only gives, doesn’t expect anything back.

91
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:47,384
If it expects anything is complete prosperity

92
00:14:47,584 --> 00:14:54,873
and the goodness of the tree.

93
00:14:59,818 --> 00:15:04,485
In the same way a saintly person, who is a Sahaja Yogi,

94
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:08,384
behaves towards his family, towards his friends,

95
00:15:08,584 --> 00:15:12,614
towards everything.

96
00:15:19,663 --> 00:15:25,132
We have used only the power of hatred so far.

97
00:15:28,241 --> 00:15:31,658
In the politics, especially, one country believes that

98
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:36,913
they must hate another country, they are born for that.

99
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:44,833
Because hundred years back

100
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:48,672
some quarrel took place or a war took place,

101
00:15:48,872 --> 00:15:53,593
so the children are still fighting among themselves.

102
00:15:59,749 --> 00:16:03,636
You’ll be amazed that when I first came to Russia,

103
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:10,851
25 German Sahaja Yogis rushed to help Me here.

104
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:22,905
Instead of bearing that malice in their hearts,

105
00:16:23,105 --> 00:16:26,655
as their forefathers had killed so many of Russians,

106
00:16:26,855 --> 00:16:32,613
they felt it was their greatest wishes to go

107
00:16:32,813 --> 00:16:37,785
and do some service for the Russians.

108
00:16:49,863 --> 00:16:56,427
So all the hatred changes into this powerful Love.

109
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:08,043
This power of Love is the greatest power and after Sahaja Yoga,

110
00:17:08,243 --> 00:17:13,422
we have to use only our power of Love.

111
00:17:18,842 --> 00:17:26,921
It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have.

112
00:17:30,835 --> 00:17:35,116
Because this is Divine Love.

113
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,848
We are getting the source of Divine Love

114
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:45,501
from the all pervading power of God’s Love.

115
00:17:50,906 --> 00:17:54,914
They say that God is Almighty.

116
00:17:57,369 --> 00:18:01,986
Then who can be more powerful than God?

117
00:18:04,603 --> 00:18:07,877
And if we are connected with God Almighty,

118
00:18:08,077 --> 00:18:12,304
who could be mightier than us?

119
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:23,511
In His Love He protects us, He gives us whatever we want,

120
00:18:23,711 --> 00:18:29,752
He blesses us and He makes us enjoy ourselves.

121
00:18:37,486 --> 00:18:44,751
His government is the most efficient
one and is very quick and very fast.

122
00:18:48,397 --> 00:18:52,939
Today only when I was coming, one
of the Sahaja Yogis came and said,

123
00:18:53,139 --> 00:18:57,850
“Mother it is very cloudy, it may rain.”

124
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:06,812
And when I came out after five minutes

125
00:19:07,013 --> 00:19:11,125
I found the whole sky is cleared out.

126
00:19:14,852 --> 00:19:23,376
So all these five elements also are at
the disposal of the children of God.

127
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:31,537
Even the cruellest of the cruel person melts down

128
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:40,899
and comes to the humble understanding of this power.

129
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:50,815
No one can harm you.

130
00:19:51,612 --> 00:19:57,104
And anybody who tries to harm you becomes melted away.

131
00:20:01,761 --> 00:20:05,238
It is so many miracles that in this short speech

132
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:07,732
I won’t be able to tell you all of them.

133
00:20:07,932 --> 00:20:13,099
But you’ll find it in your life itself, how this power of Love,

134
00:20:13,299 --> 00:20:18,843
that you have within your heart, has protected you.

135
00:20:28,005 --> 00:20:30,648
I have seen people who are very hot tempered,

136
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:35,918
who are angry type, who are all the
time making other’s life miserable,

137
00:20:36,119 --> 00:20:41,336
become extremely beautiful, nice people.

138
00:20:51,924 --> 00:20:57,404
With this Light of Love, you love yourself in the right way

139
00:20:57,604 --> 00:21:03,765
and give up all that is wrong, all that is immoral.

140
00:21:12,254 --> 00:21:17,022
This Love is eternal, is very powerful

141
00:21:17,222 --> 00:21:24,846
and gives you a confidence in the collectivity of human beings.

142
00:21:29,665 --> 00:21:37,813
Because it’s the Spirit which enlightens all your power.

143
00:21:41,215 --> 00:21:48,895
And the Spirit is the source of collectivity and love

144
00:21:49,095 --> 00:21:53,189
for every human being in the world.

145
00:21:58,239 --> 00:22:02,102
Then your attention goes to all the people who are in trouble,

146
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:07,953
who are suffering, who need help.

147
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:16,833
And with this attention, which is so enlightened,

148
00:22:17,033 --> 00:22:22,300
you can solve their problems sitting down here.

149
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:33,862
With such people there’s no need to have any wars,

150
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:40,696
no need to have any weapons, no need to have any boundaries.

151
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:52,719
If Russians go to India, they feel India as their country,

152
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:58,848
if Indians come to Russia they think Russia their own country.

153
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:10,151
So who will fight?

154
00:23:10,351 --> 00:23:14,753
There’s no one to whom you can really say: “He is my enemy” ,

155
00:23:14,953 --> 00:23:20,552
because everybody is part and parcel of your being.

156
00:23:29,696 --> 00:23:35,601
These are the special times, I call them the Blossom time

157
00:23:35,801 --> 00:23:42,239
when too many flowers are there who are seeking the Truth.

158
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:57,954
And their fragrance is their Love.

159
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:05,536
And they have all to become fruits now.

160
00:24:07,646 --> 00:24:10,624
And this is what is going to happen

161
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:15,680
as these times are very, very important.

162
00:24:20,383 --> 00:24:24,758
In all the religions they are described.

163
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:31,021
We don’t hate anyone because we believe in one religion

164
00:24:31,221 --> 00:24:38,068
or another religion. On the contrary,
we believe in all the religions.

165
00:24:46,884 --> 00:24:50,723
This is the power by which a drop becomes the ocean

166
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:55,197
and individual becomes the collective.

167
00:25:02,091 --> 00:25:05,591
So all your powers that are there are enlightened

168
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:09,924
by the all pervading power.

169
00:25:15,057 --> 00:25:23,281
It transforms you and it has such a beautiful, delicate way

170
00:25:23,481 --> 00:25:27,739
of handling everything.

171
00:25:35,082 --> 00:25:41,526
The only thing that is needed is faith in this power,

172
00:25:44,566 --> 00:25:49,249
that only by having Love for others,

173
00:25:49,449 --> 00:25:53,405
and this enlightened Love

174
00:25:53,605 --> 00:25:59,346
is going to give you whatever you want.

175
00:26:07,169 --> 00:26:12,075
And there is such a power, All-pervading power.

176
00:26:18,448 --> 00:26:22,663
There is no doubt about it.

177
00:26:22,863 --> 00:26:27,118
And we have to just accept it with our open heart

178
00:26:27,318 --> 00:26:32,982
that it fills it and makes us a great personality.

179
00:26:39,244 --> 00:26:43,099
So there’s no competition, there’s no ambition,

180
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:49,239
there’s no jealousy, nothing of the kind.

181
00:26:55,180 --> 00:27:00,308
The only desire then left is that "I am enjoying myself,

182
00:27:00,508 --> 00:27:04,539
let others also enjoy."

183
00:27:11,118 --> 00:27:16,672
People go out of the way to spread Sahaja Yoga.

184
00:27:20,211 --> 00:27:26,232
They work very hard, travel with very little money,

185
00:27:26,432 --> 00:27:29,607
they try to convince people,

186
00:27:29,807 --> 00:27:35,599
do all kinds of things for no material gain.

187
00:27:43,497 --> 00:27:46,536
But the greatest joy is when you see that

188
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:49,911
you have raised the Kundalini of another person

189
00:27:50,111 --> 00:27:54,791
and given him self-realisation.

190
00:28:01,663 --> 00:28:06,852
That lits up your faces I have seen many times.

191
00:28:12,456 --> 00:28:17,894
Let this Love grow more and more.

192
00:28:21,142 --> 00:28:26,556
They asked me, why of all places I came to Togliatti.

193
00:28:30,126 --> 00:28:38,508
Not for Volga, not for these beautiful houses you have

194
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:43,289
but for My children who are here.

195
00:28:50,054 --> 00:28:54,450
May God bless you.
