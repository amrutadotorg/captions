1975-0219 Public program day 3, Mumbai, India,Pasq

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:35.892
Yesterday  I explained to you the position of the kundalini in our spinal cord

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.892
and why it exists there, and what are its functions.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:56.892
God has created human beings in his own image and all these things that I have told you yesterday

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:15.892
are first built up in the body of the Virata that is the aspect of God in which all that is created exists.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:33.892
But let us see in the human being in what way this kundalini came.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.892
As I have told you yesterday that there are three powers that exist in the body

00:01:41.000 --> 00:02:00.892
and the most important one is the central one which is incarnated as Mahalakshmi which helped us to evolve into a superhuman being.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.892
That channel is known as Sushumna which I have shown you in the centre.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.892
And there is a gap between the navel point and the abode of the kundalini.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.892
This portion of that channel or you can say of that energy is settled down here and kundalini,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.892
which is not used till you get the chance of meeting somebody who can give you self-realization and that is the only time the kundalini rises.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:47.892
These two exist within us psychological. One has the constructive power by which we think,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.892
or we can say the preconscious mind , the Mana the postman

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.892
which is every moment receiving something from the conscious mind and putting it into the subconscious mind.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.892
For example, you are listening to me, you are paying attention to me. I am talking something,

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.892
you are receiving it from me and it is going into your past.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.892
Again you are receiving from me and it is going into the past.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:36.892
So this represents the preconscious mind while the other is the storing of all your experiences is the subconscious mind.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.892
We have two minds, lying vertically parallel on both the sides of the Sushumna.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:57.892
This is one of the greatest facts most of the people who have been searching God have not understood.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.892
That to go to your Sushumna Nadi or to go to your present moment.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.892
And this moment when you are listening to me moment to moment you are living, this conscious mind,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.892
to approach that conscious mind and stay there at that point one need not go to the subconscious or to the preconscious.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.892
One need not to control the preconscious mind. That is the Mana,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.892
neither it is necessary for you to go to the subconscious mind as have these siddhis and things like that and go to the bhootvidya and pretavidya.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.892
Both things are not at all necessary, on the contrary, those who go on these lines

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:47.892
might be able to see the kundalini, they might be able to see all the chakras from the backdoor,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.892
while in the centre when you rise in the Sushumna Nadi then you do not see anything whatsoever

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:04.892
but you just jump out. Later on you can come down and see all this.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:13.892
For example, I live in London. In my house, is about ten miles drive from the station.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.892
Some people, visitors are coming to see me, so I have to receive them at the station.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:26.892
I go there, receive them and they come to my house, direct.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.892
You know about London that nobody is seen on the streets.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.892
It’s a very small village so there is nobody on the streets. You can’t meet  anybody.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.892
You just come straight to your own house, and then you enter inside the  house.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.892
You stay there, then you know your neighbours gradually.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:52.892
But supposing somebody arrives without telling me, and he has to find out my house.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.892
So he goes from places to places to the backdoors, because front door nobody is willing to open in England,

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.892
especially in London, people are afraid. So he goes from the backdoor.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:13.892
Goes from one house to another house inquiring as to where is this house, where I have to go?

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:25.892
And the people call him inside, give him tea, offering something and the person is lost there.

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.892
He never reaches the real house.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.892
In the same way, those people who go on the sides either by preconscious method,

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.892
or by the subconscious method both of them jump into something else

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:51.892
which has nothing to do with the central path and are thrown sideways either to the right or to the left to the resonance.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:09.892
And there are some people who want you to be deluded, to be stopped, to be sponged, exploited so they stop you going that side.

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:17.892
That is what enticement is,  that is what we call as the hypnosis.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:26.892
When you hypnotize a person what happens is that his attention immediately goes into his subconscious mind and he is  hypnotized.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:35.892
But we do not understand that by hypnosis it is not only our subconscious in which we are existing.

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.892
While we sleep we are in our subconscious, but there is no hypnosis.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.892
Actually in the subconscious mind, beyond  the subconscious mind,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.892
is the connection to the collective subconscious which we call the Paralok. The complete dead exist there.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:57.892
All those who died exist there. So these people enter into your psyche,

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:07.892
become one with your psyche, and they dominate your  personality in your head and you become absolutely hypnotized.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.892
Then you can do whatever you like with that person. The thinking power is completely finished,

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.892
your brain is completely washed off. You may call it conditioning, I think it is much worse than that.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:33.892
Conditioning is a very very mild word. Actually, we never get conditioned if we are left to ourselves.

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.892
But we get conditioned when we start reading other people.

00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:51.892
When we start attending to such people, meeting them, taking prasad from them, food from them.

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:57.892
You have seen such people with dhoras and dandhas and things like that.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:06.892
All these things carry the germ of conditionings and hypnosis. The dead sit in that.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.892
They exist whether you like it or not, whether you accept it or not.

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.892
Even the psychologists, I have some very great psychologists as my disciples,

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.892
they were arguing with me “Why do you call it the Spirit?” then I said what do you call it ?

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:25.892
They said it can be because you know the person, it might be your father or your mother.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.892
You must have seen the pictures I have shown you, where he was trying to copy his mother.

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:36.892
I said what about the people who you have never seen, you have not known?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.892
You talk like that person, and if you verify it you will find it’s true.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.892
In London, I visited one lunatic asylum, where I found there were patients they could not understand.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.892
When I talked to them, they started talking as if somebody said that “I do not belong to this place,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.892
I belong to Paris, and I live there and this thing happened, and there was an accident and I died.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:03.892
And this lady had come to Paris and I got off - oh over”

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.892
I asked this lady what happened and she would not say anything. She didn’t know she was doing.....[UNCLEAR].

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:18.892
Then we inquired. I told them to find out. And there was such and such person who died at such and such point, with an accident.

00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.892
And this lady had gone there and had a shock because her husband was lost somewhere

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:30.892
and she was in a shock condition and this shock identity went into her.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.892
But all such identities that enter into your psyche are one of the most deprived people,

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:43.892
absolutely depravity personified. They are the worst type of people you could think.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.892
They can tell all kinds of lies. They can do whatever is possible under the sun.

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.892
I mean even the animals won’t do the things they can do.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:03.892
Those who are good people never enter into the body but sometimes they hover around.

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.892
For example, somebody has died, or the wife has died or the mother dies, especially the mother.

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.892
If the mother dies in very small childhood, then the mother doesn’t want to leave the son or the daughter

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.892
because she wants to protect it. She is with the child all the time, but she doesn’t harm.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.892
But of course, that affects the child’s personality too

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:37.892
and the child’s manifestation to become himself because of the hovering of the mother.

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.892
I have found out during these  6-7 years of my experiments with people,

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:50.892
that on your hands you can feel it if there is such an affectation on a  person.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.892
It can happen to anybody, even to the most religious, to the nicest person.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:12.892
And sometimes it can happen to a person who is shocked, who is under some kind of a mental strain.

00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:18.892
In London, there is an organization known as the Universal Curative Centre or something like that by Dr.Lang.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.892
This doctor doesn’t exist, he died a long time back. There are many organizations like that.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.892
I am giving you an example. He died long time back. Of course, they are honest people, they tell the truth, they don’t tell lies,

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:37.892
but they don’t know the effects of this kind of thing. This fellow died in London

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:48.892
and he said that his manifestation or whatever he wanted to do was not complete and he was dissatisfied.

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:54.892
So when one soldier was fighting in Vietnam, he was shocked with something.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.892
This doctor entered into his being and told him that

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.892
“You go to my son and ask him to open his dispensary and I will talk to him. You just don’t worry.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:14.892
And he drove this man mad, so that he could not help it and he had to go to London.

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:21.892
He was an uneducated soldier. He went and talked to this son of his, and told him that

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.892
“I am such and such and that you’d better open your dispensary, I want to start my work and also my operations.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:31.892
He was amazed, this soldier was such an uncouth person and he never seen what is surgery.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:39.892
How is he going to operate? So, the person inside him told him “No, I am your father, believe me”.

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.892
And he told him lots of secrets which passed between the son and the father.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:51.892
And he was quite convinced and  they opened this universal curative centre or whatever you may call it.

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.892
You can give it any name. And they started curing people.

00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:00.892
They said at about 5 o’clock at this time you will feel something.

00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:07.892
And 5 o’clock anywhere in the world when they sent you the letter, that at 5 O’clock in your place I will appear,

00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.892
the person felt shivering. The person felt terrible shivering in the body

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.892
and the person felt alright and better and many things get cured.

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.892
But later on after one year or two years that person would start be suffering from neurosis.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:27.892
All kinds of trouble came to him and his family lost all fortunes and all kinds of problems

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.892
and his body started aching and everything happened.

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:44.892
All these things are absolute truth. We have patients from that centre whom I have treated myself.

00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:53.892
These are the spirits which enter into your body and cure you. And don’t believe in all such cures.

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.892
You should be cured by your own powers that is your kundalini which is lying here.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:05.892
Which is is going to recharge your batteries. Don’t depend on all these cures which people are giving you that

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:14.892
“Oh, I will give you some mantras, you put it here”. Those mantras mean nothing else but a spirit. I can prove it to you.

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.892
Many people who have been with me in the beginning were very against me, when I told them about it,

00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.892
but gradually they realized that this is a thing in us. It is working.

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.892
There is a very big war on between the evil forces and the Divine forces.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:43.892
You cannot see that. They are having a strategy now, a wonderful strategy, as all clever, cunning, worthless people have;

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:52.892
is to come on this Earth as human beings, take the name of God, and act as fifth column.

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:59.892
Supposing,  Russians want to invade America, or  Americans want to invade Russia.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:07.892
They take the name of Americans, go there live like Americans, or they may take the name of the Russians, and live like Russians.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:12.892
They call them God, incarnations, all kinds of things.

00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.892
In London, somebody told me that Christ has come.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.892
I said “Really? I never knew that. How do you believe he is Christ?” “Because he says he is Christ”.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.892
I said everybody can say that. What is so great in that?

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.892
“No Christ has come. He says ‘I am Christ’”. I said there is a very simple test of Christ. You go find out.

00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:32.892
“You tell him to control the elements. Can he control the elements?”

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:41.892
Christ used to control the elements. If someone says “I am the Adishakti”. You ask him “Can you control the kundalini of people?”.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:49.892
If you cannot, then you are not Adishakti. All these signs and symptoms are already given in our books.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:54.892
We have not to believe these people, what they tell us, these fake people.

00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.892
We have to understand that this is all given in our books.

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.892
The problem is this modern generation is most uneducated.

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.892
If you read the Devi Mahatmyam, a simple book written by Markandeya Swami,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.892
you will know that all these things given in that, like how to make out a person,

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:18.892
who is an incarnation, who is not an incarnation.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:28.892
Of course, there is an incarnating power which has incarnated which I have told you about yesterday and is going to incarnate

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:36.892
But you must know that if these people have taken some garb,

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:45.892
the incarnation is also going to take some  garb to hide and work secretly.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:53.892
You are the people who should know how to judge a person who is real and who is unreal.

00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.892
Who are the people who have come into this world to destroy all the good forces,

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:08.892
all the constructive forces, and establish complete destruction . You have to  judge.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:17.892
You have to find out and that is the force I am talking about which is the we call the negative forces.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:25.892
That is at work. Believe me, you may not like it because you just refuse it, whatever is new to you.

00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:34.892
It exists.  In this city of Bombay you will be surprised  there are many centres like that which are working secretly to harm other people.

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:46.892
You go and pay some money to that person. He will take some money from you and he can put a spell on the enemies of that person.

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:57.892
Even for five rupees these dirty people can put a spell on another person, and they do not know that what are they up to.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.892
You can live without food in this world, but with such sinful lives,

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.892
God knows what is going to happen to these people. I always say forgive them.

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.892
It is a tremendous profession which these people are working at.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.892
They will show you miracles. You will feel it is a very great thing that has happened.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.892
It all works out through these negative forces. You beware of them.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:34.892
They will show you chamatkaras. All kinds of chamatkaras can be shown.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.892
And you may start believing them, thinking that they are very great people.

00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.892
The Sahaja Yoga has come at the time when you people do not know much about it.

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:59.892
Your forefathers knew better. That time Sahaja Yoga did not come where they would never believe in a sadhu who.... [UNCLEAR]

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.892
Never, never, never.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:09.892
In my own family we had once a very interesting incident when there was a wedding on,

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:18.892
and the people who came were very fussy people. You know in U.P people can fuss a lot about things.

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:25.892
They said we will have dahi vadas. You cannot make it so quickly and they said it is very difficult to make it.

00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.892
But there is one Bhigad Baba who was sitting outside the city. “We  can call him and he will  do it”

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:35.892
So they called that Bhigad Baba and Bhigad Baba came and said that

00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:45.892
“There is no dahi vada in the city just now, but I will get you dahi vada, no doubt, but you should allow me to go away next moment.”

00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.892
He closed all the doors,  one window he left it open and he sat down.

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.892
After sometime he opened the door and they saw the dahi vada lying there.

00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.892
Naturally everybody was so worried, that they took the dahi vada and started distributing it.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.892
But when they returned back to see the Bhigad baba had disappeared, nicely from there. From the window he has run away.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.892
Next day, Mahar you know we have got these Mahar people. Of course,

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.892
still we are continuing with that  dirty method of having some people as untouchables.

00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:32.892
They came over to me and they saw these utensils, what we call as kulad.

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.892
And they said who has brought these dahi vadas from our place?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:40.892
We were having dinner there and suddenly all disappeared. Who has brought this here?

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:44.892
And all the  barathis got so annoyed and angry they said “What, is this.

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:53.892
These Maharis have brought Dahi vadas and you have given us Mahari dahi vadas” and then they realized why Bhigad baba had ran away.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.892
They take a subtle form. They first of all, control them. They go in the smashanas.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:05.892
They go everywhere Most of these vibhutis that is coming, are coming from smashanas. Don’t eat it.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:13.892
For heaven’s sake never eat these vibuthis. Your this chakra will be completely ruined.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:25.892
Open your head. Which god gave vibhuti for people to eat?

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:31.892
This Bhigad baba had run away. I wish all of them run away. That is the best way to solve a problem.

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.892
But it is you who believe in all these things.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.892
There is a very rich man who came to me and he said certain gentleman had given me,

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.892
some babaji had given me a very big diamond ring. I knew the gentleman very well.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.892
I said how many rings you have got? He said I don’t know.

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:52.892
Then I said why did you ask for the ring. He said “Mataji, I never asked for the ring.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:23:02.892
But the gentleman gave me. And I thought it was ashirvad I took it.” I said “why didn’t he give it to your driver who is a poor man.”

00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.892
Then I said but why have you come to me now.  Your baba has given you anguti. You sit down at home.

00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:16.892
You do his bhajans raat din sing his bhajan Praise him, praise the lord who has given you anguti.

00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.892
So the fellow got very upset and he said “Then I must tell you something that I have come for.” I said what is it?

00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.892
He said from my house many diamonds are missing. I said very nice.

00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.892
I said you please call your wife next time, I’ll have a talk with her.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:34.892
The wife came and  I took out her badha from her and I said now talk.

00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.892
I said what is it happening to you? She said there is somebody in my head embedded in this ring I think?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.892
who is telling me this all worldly things are useless. You give them to baba, give all this to baba.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.892
And I am giving it to baba. That lady is a lady doctor you see.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:59.892
She is not an ordinary woman. She is an educated lady, a lady doctor of very great eminence.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:06.892
I was amazed, I said what has happened to your brain? Have you sold them out?

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.892
Just think about one thing, that the thing that are stones that are useless things, worthless things for you,

00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.892
why are they so important to Sri Babaji?

00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:25.892
Why is he taking them and why are you giving him the stones. That struck her mind.

00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:34.892
She came to her senses. She said “Oh I never thought of it. And every time I go he asks me how many have  you brought?”

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.892
This is what happens to your brain. You are washed out. People will tell you you to take a sanyas.

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:47.892
Very nicely you all take a sanyas and give your money up. I  will manage your income tax, come along.

00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:52.892
Very good way of taking sanyas. This is what these people are doing to you

00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.892
and that is one of the greatest impediments I am facing in this country and abroad.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.892
When I find people and when I try to give them kundalini, they say “Mataji, we have just went for his lecture”

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.892
“ And then?” “No once I danced there.” “And what else?” “No, I just didn’t do much I only paid one thousand rupees.

00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:13.892
I said “Very nice you have paid one thousand rupees for five or six of them sitting on your head.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.892
You have no freedom at all left. From one conditioning to another conditioning you are willing to go,

00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.892
but not to a person who will tell you to be free. You will stay with one person who will condition you with something.

00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:31.892
It is a very nice thing that only by dancing you get God. Very wonderful thing of doing things.

00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:39.892
There is one gentleman who goes to America very often. He has made lots of money also. He puts you into Trance.

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:44.892
One of his disciples came to India and he discovered about me and then he came to London to see me.

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.892
His name is Mr. Jean. He told me that “Mataji, I have a very funny thing that is happening to me. I said what happened. ?

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.892
“He said that I am the disciple of such and such person”. And then what happened? What is wrong with you?

00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:03.892
He said the problem is when I started meditating according to him. I got into trance.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:11.892
And when I came down from trance, I felt that I must kill my parents.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:18.892
They are good for nothing, why should I have my parents? I must kill them. Who are they to me?

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:24.892
“But I started judging. This is not religion. This nobody has done.

00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.892
Rama obeyed his parents. Who has killed his parents? I started thinking about it.

00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.892
So when I went again into a trance, I came back and I felt I must kill myself.”

00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.892
And he said I have tried to kill myself many a times. Many a times I have tried to kill.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:47.892
He is the son of a rich man. And my father sent me to India to meet you. You were not there so I have come here.

00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:56.892
I asked him “Jean what did your master tell you, what mantra?”

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:09.892
So he told me one name of a very great  rishi. Shringa was a very great rishi who was responsible for the yagnya done by Dashrata for having a son.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.892
I said how can such a great man enter into the psychic it’s impossible?

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:19.892
So I said to take the name of Shringa. How do you do it?

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.892
So he closed his eyes and started taking the name Shringa, Shringa.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.892
Immediately that fellow, a horrible one came on his face, I could see.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:38.892
He had two horrible eyes and very big teeth and he had one, only one unicorn.

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.892
That also you know, is known as Shringa. Shringa also means the horn.

00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:52.892
And it was this fellow with one horn. So I know all these tricks very well.

00:27:53.000 --> 00:28:01.892
I tied this Mr.Sringa, I brought him home, and I tied him on to one of the, don’t get frightened. centre.

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:07.892
Nothing to be serious about. When the mother is there she has to tell you everything.

00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:13.892
I tied him  to a tree and I said Mr. Shringa please tell me what you are up to.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.892
Otherwise I will never relieve you. I must know what is he up to.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.892
As you catch some spies and you take out all that has happened on the other side of the earth.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:34.892
Mr. Shringa came out with the reality. He told me that we are-on the other side

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:40.892
on the negative side are trying to build up our empire of destruction,

00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:53.892
of depravity and for that we few rakshasas are working for one of this gentlemen who is a rakshas.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.892
And he told me the name of the rakshas who was once upon a time killed by the Devi Durga.

00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.892
And this fellow is in contact with about thousands of rakshasas

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.892
but there are few who can enter into the psyche of human beings.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.892
So I am trained that whenever I am called because there are subtle bodies.

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.892
I come to those people, I enter into their psyche, guide them,

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:33.892
and through me I put these other rakshasas into other people’s psyche. So the thing start expanding.

00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.892
You get surprised thousands of people thronging for what introduction for that spirit in you.

00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.892
They introduce this spiritual .........[UNCLEAR]. They do not know that they do not care for it.

00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:54.892
Like it is the introduction of the spirit they do not believe in it. They will never accept it. They will go on with it and go on with it.

00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.892
But then I said “Why is it? Why is it that you made this fellow kill himself?”

00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:06.892
He said “It is because we want more dead people. We want more dead people to come in

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:10.892
to help us to enter into the psyche of human beings”.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.892
And then because he refused to kill his parents, we wanted him to kill him.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:26.892
“And then what do you want ultimately?” He said that “There will be an epidemic of criminality in the United States”.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.892
And that’s the fact. They work when there are drugs on.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.892
You take the drugs, your awareness goes out and immediately they enter in.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:50.892
This is a very wonderful way of doing things. Here I am alone standing with my  half hearted disciples.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:56.892
Because I do not entice them. They are free, absolutely free in their own freedom.

00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:05.892
In their entire awareness they have to accept it and take it

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.892
and to practice it and to go ahead with the war of love.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:18.892
We on one side  are preaching love the other side is hatred, but they will take the name of love and hit at it.

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:25.892
That’s why you will find they are always contradicting  themselves. There is no other proof.

00:31:26.000 --> 00:31:31.892
But you will find in their minds a tormenting soul.

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:43.892
A person who talks of religion has to be a very peace-loving, affectionate, kind, helpful person.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:47.892
While these dharmic people-if you find them-they will beat their wives,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:52.892
beat their children, beat everyone that is possible. If it is possible, they can kill  also.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:32:02.892
Because there is a depraved personality inside. And ultimately they will have a senile. They will die of insanity.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:09.892
At this moment in kali yuga we are standing so precariously on this verge of destruction.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:20.892
I am not telling you stories. Believe me, it is. If you want the complete transformation, of this age,

00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:26.892
into a beautiful age of reality, of truth and love and bliss.

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.892
It is in your hands to choose today in your own freedom.

00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.892
You have to gather courage and know that you are the chosen ones who have to do this job.

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:52.892
Nothing is needed much. Nothing is to be done but to accept the bliss of God. Do not play into their hands.

00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:59.892
Yesterday as I told you, that when you get self-realization,

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.892
then you jump into your unconscious mind. Then you find these are vibrations flowing from your fingers,

00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:11.892
you can when I am speaking put your hands towards me, doesn’t matter. It helps.

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:16.892
You will find there are vibrations, cool vibrations flowing towards you.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.892
Please put your hands. There is nothing wrong. Don’t be obstinate.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:30.892
You will find very cool breeze flowing into your being. I am cooling you down, making you tranquil and peaceful.

00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:38.892
It is not a trance, you are aware. Absolutely aware. You are listening to me, what I am talking.

00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:47.892
And on your hands, you will find that there are these chakras represented.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:53.892
These chakras are the centers I talked to you about. They are absolutely there.

00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:01.892
For example if you have ten people and blindfolded, if they had to test one man,

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:07.892
you put them together-all of them together-put also five children

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:13.892
and when you ask them what is the matter they will all raise one finger.

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.892
That means on the right hand side the vishuddhi chakra is caught up.

00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.892
You ask the person “Are you suffering from any trouble of the throat?” He says

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:34.892
“I have been suffering for many years” If you put your vibrations on his vishuddhi chakra at the back from far,

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:43.892
this chakra will open out and you will find he will start  getting the vibrations.

00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:49.892
Here we have shown you, but I don’t know if you can see, I will show you on my own hand

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:55.892
that these are the two hands of right and left. I have told you on the left hand side is the negative side

00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:02.892
or we can say is the side that belongs to the Chandra nadi. And this belongs to the Surya nadi.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:10.892
Where they meet in the center are the deities. Now this hand has got five fingers.

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:15.892
This is the Mooladhara chakra, you can see, and these are the three channels

00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:26.892
which we know which side is the heart and which side is the aortic plexus which you can say as the Swadishthana chakra.

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.892
This is the Hriday chakra and this is the Swadishthana chakra which is guided by Brahmadeva and this is guided by Shiva.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:41.892
Now if this finger is burning then you must know on the left hand side, on the Heart, means on the heart organ itself there is a problem.

00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.892
If you take the name of Shiva or if you say ‘Om namah Shiva’ if you are realized, otherwise not.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:52.892
Then you will find the problem will go away and the person will be alright.

00:35:53.000 --> 00:36:00.892
It is absolutely automatic. You don’t have to get education for this, to understand this nothing.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.892
For small children I have seen, they find a little burning, they go on rubbing.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.892
They go on rubbing their fingers you find the person is cured.

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:16.892
Children are very simple, are very simple and it works very fast with them.

00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:22.892
Now in the centre is the Nabhi chakra which is controlling the solar plexus.

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:30.892
Here this finger in the centre. This is the Nabhi chakra.

00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:43.892
Now, this centre when you start getting burning in your hand, all the problems of the Nabhi chakra are denoted through this.

00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:52.892
This finger, I have already told you , the vishuddhi chakra is here.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.892
For this there is no education needed nothing. Only thing you need to do is raise your finger if you do it like this.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:08.892
Even the most uneducated can do it. You just jolly well have to do it. It is the truth and a fact and a science.

00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:14.892
I am not telling you stories. You come find out for yourself.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:24.892
This portion of the hand, if it starts burning or these portions if they start burning here,

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:33.892
then it is an inheritance in you. So you have to ask your parents in your heart to depart.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.892
Maybe your mother or your father is hovering, or something is happening on this chakra

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:47.892
or this part, or the inheritance. This finger is now very important because it is here.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:57.892
You must have known that anytime you have to apply to left to God, you have to use this finger,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.892
and on this finger, is the Agnya chakra, which is like one rod moving.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:10.892
Here in the front is Christ, and here, this side is Shri Ganesh, Bhairav and Hanuman.

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:18.892
Two of them join here but actually Christ is controlling. If this chakra is caught up,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:23.892
you have to take the name of Christ and it works out. It opens up.

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:29.892
These devils that are working out their satanic forces are working through this chakra or Nabhi chakra

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.892
because these are the two places where they hit.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:43.892
The turn this in the opposite direction and throw something inside so that you become ascetic.

00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.892
The other day I had some gentleman who came to see, started arguing with me too much

00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:52.892
because he thought he was all very knowledgeable. I asked, “Who is your guru?”

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.892
and he gave me some name of somebody in Puna. I said “Alright put your hands” and he started shaking.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.892
And afterwards he said “I am getting frozen now, Mataji” I said “I am not freezing you, I assure you I am not freezing you.

00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:09.892
It is somebody inside you that is freezing you. It will go away” He said “ What is to be done?”

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:16.892
I said “Can you beat your guru with shoes?” He said “That’s too much” I said you have to do it. You try. You try.

00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.892
So I told him how to beat. This is Quran-e-Sharief has written.

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:25.892
These things are given in Quran-e-Sharief. I said “You take out your shoes from your feet,

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.892
and beat him there. I will tell you how to do it with a parabola around it.”

00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.892
And this fellow couldn’t bear it, he could not do anything. He said “How can I beat?”

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.892
I asked somebody else to do it and he immediately became normal.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.892
I said “How much money have you given to your guru to begin with?” He said “

00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:49.892
Only seven thousand rupees”. I said “Only? And what else?”

00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:57.892
He said “For sixteen years, Mataji, I have suffered like that. I have lost my job, I have no money, I given also whatever I had to him”.

00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.892
In London I meet so many boys, young boys, english boys, and american boys, and german boys,

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:06.892
who do not even have shoes to wear because they have given away all their money to these gurus,

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:13.892
and the gurus are moving in big Rolls Royce . They should be ashamed of themselves.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:21.892
Their parents have drained out all their property to satisfy these children.

00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:28.892
And then gaanja, all these things are available with these gurus, in a secret manner.

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.892
To them religion means nothing, no holiness nothing. They will flirt with women. They are gurus after all,

00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:40.892
yes they are all Krishna. They are all Shri Krishna’s Avatar  they tell me.

00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:46.892
That’s why they are flirting with women. There was one gentleman like that who told me he was Krishna’s avatar.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.892
I told him that if I catch hold of your dadi you’ll be shaking. The one who at five years of age who killed Kalia.

00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.892
What are you talking about? And you’ll be surprised, I didn’t curse him but after a day somebody caught hold of his dadi,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:06.892
and he was dancing for half an hour. That’s what I heard from people.

00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.892
There is Shri Krishna. There is Shri Rama. These are all the enemies.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:25.892
The Kansa has taken, the Ravan has taken birth and are calling themselves by the name of God.

00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:32.892
So in this hands, you can see for yourself in these two hands these are the temples of God.

00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:42.892
These two hands are the temples of God. In bhakti, if genuinely you ask Him, your bhakti becomes aakaar.

00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:50.892
It becomes avatar, and it comes on this earth to save you, and give you salvation.

00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:59.892
These two hands are not to be spoiled by doing wrong things. There are the deities sitting.

00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:05.892
When you talk of doing seva to others, remember you are not doing any seva to anybody else

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:16.892
but yourself. Sahaja Yoga is the only method by which you do this collective seva without doing any karma.

00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:22.892
You are curing people automatically. You are improving their conditions,

00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.892
you are improving their minds, you are giving them peace, their family life is improved.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:36.892
They are chaste people. They are wiser people, they are healthier people, they are beautiful people.

00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:43.892
What other kinds of social work you are doing?

00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:51.892
This is the greatest social work you can do to others. is to just stand and give vibrations, which is pouring through you.

00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.892
You just keep on the medium of that Divine power. And not only that you are giving

00:42:57.000 --> 00:43:05.892
but it gives you the joy, the complete joy. How does it gives you the complete joy? I will tell you. It is very short.

00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.892
We have three beings :emotional, mental and also physical beings.

00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:17.892
These three beings exist within us that we know of and at least you believe in.

00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:22.892
The fourth one we do not believe in is the religious being, doesn’t matter.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:33.892
But when we think of our physical being, we want to enjoy the body by giving it comfort.

00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:43.892
But while trying all that we form habits, we become slaves of this life. Why be the slaves of this life while we can be the king.

00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:53.892
Then we start possessing things. For example, the myth of possession works onto you like a headache

00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:58.892
and you develop tension and tension and tension. Because when I look at this all I think

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.892
“Oh God how will I take this home?, how will I get money? Where will I go, how will do it?”

00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:10.892
All ideas come into you. You listen to music, you start thinking who is the musician, who is singing,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:15.892
what is he singing, is he correct or wrong. All the thoughts in between.

00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:20.892
But if you are listening to that music, absolutely in thoughtless awareness,

00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:28.892
in silence when there is not a ripple of thought in complete freedom.

00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.892
The artist is pouring his heart before you. All the joy that great artist is pouring through that,

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.892
you feel a wave of enjoyment falling on to you from top. The bliss coming on to you.

00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:53.892
You don’t say anything. The silent, the silent joy of creation becomes one, identified with yourself.

00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:00.892
And you feel the joy. In mental pursuits also we  are searching out.

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.892
In the science we find out this, in science we find out that, this we found. Are we happy with what  we found?

00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:16.892
You are not. It doesn’t give you happiness. And spirit is out.  You find out one theory, it is thrown out. You find out another, it is thrown out.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:26.892
But this just responds to the absolute knowledge. Then the whole thing becomes open like a book.

00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:31.892
And the greatest knowledge: you feel it that we are all one.

00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:39.892
There is only one thread passing through all these beads of beautiful pearls. Only one thread.

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.892
And Once you jump onto that thread, you become one with God.

00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:53.892
his knowledge is the greatest knowledge of all. And then all the knowledge pours in

00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:59.892
Because now you are at that point from where the knowledge sprung out.

00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:06.892
The whole dictionary the whole library of knowledge is open to you.

00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:16.892
Whenever you want to know something, just dip a little handkerchief in that ocean and you know it.

00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:23.892
You become one with that knowledge, so you get the complete enjoyment,

00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:29.892
in the emotional side also. Your emotional being, you love your husband.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:36.892
Husband dies means you are finished. You love your wife. Wife dies means you are finished your own children

00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:42.892
The idea of conviction of your husband and children. If the husband dies you will be crying for the husband

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.892
but you will never do what he wanted all his life. See the conflict.

00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:54.892
This is the thinking and the knowledge and the love. There is no integration between the three.

00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.892
Even if you rationally understand, “Yes, my husband said so, that I should have done this, I should have done it,

00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.892
and he was very much wanting to do it” But still physically, you will say ‘Oh I can’t.’

00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:15.892
There is no integration between these three things. And the love that is bound in one’s love,

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:25.892
the sap of love, it is finished in one flower, can kill the whole tree and the flower dies automatically.

00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:42.892
All such love is the death of love. But the love that just pours, the love that flows without any ask,

00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:56.892
like the sunshine, the love that just gives, and the joy that it is filled

00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:11.892
with flows and flows to pour the joy-that infinite love of God can be yours at this moment-

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:19.892
that is what is flowing, this pranava, this omkar, this roop, this unhalak.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:28.892
This is flowing through you which is controlling on one side-the gross of all the masses,

00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:38.892
the creative part-the other side, all the storing of the dead and the third side  your evolution.

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:44.892
The same pranava is acting in three forms, the powers of Adishakti.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:56.892
The mother is the primordial mother, the spouse of our father.

00:48:57.000 --> 00:49:00.892
May God Bless You.

00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:06.892
I would request you to stay on for meditation for sometime. Yesterday,

00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:13.892
some people did get vibrations and it was very good. I saw them this morning, I was overjoyed.

00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:19.892
Today also I hope that you get it and do come for meditation tomorrow morning.

00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.892
Try to come because there we can find out. Give little time to yourself.

00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.892
I know you all are very busy people doing very important work, but little time you can give to yourself.

00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:38.892
You should try to give a little time to yourself. You are the people who should first become doctors,

00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:45.892
and then you can treat other people. You can treat and you can improve them.

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:50.892
You can give them awakening and also realization. In these three days,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.892
I could not cover up the whole thing. It is impossible even if you give me the whole year.

00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.892
And people have been with me for five years and every time they say

00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:03.892
“ Mataji, this we did not know, that we did not know.” Now, the trouble is that I want you to subject yourself

00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:09.892
to be the knowledge yourself so that you will know what I am talking about. I will not tell you.

00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.892
You are your own guru. I am only a mother who looks after the child when the child is born,

00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:20.892
for sometime. Then when you are grown, you are matured, nobody can affect you.

00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:26.892
You are prophets. Then that is the glory of the mother to see her children grow.
