00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.029
Now then there, we have another center on top,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.379
which we call as the heart center.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.490
It is in the center.

00:00:14.571 --> 00:00:16.829
Now in the sternum bone, 
behind the sternum bone

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.190
this center is there,

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:21.916
and thymus produces the antibodies

00:00:22.164 --> 00:00:23.729
in your sternum bone.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:27.601
These antibodies, later on, fight your diseases.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:30.489
When you are about twelve years of age

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.148
they go into the whole body, and waiting there,

00:00:33.349 --> 00:00:39.256
for a signal from your sternum bone.

00:00:39.443 --> 00:00:42.168
That means supposing you see something, 
you get frightened,

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:44.135
this bone starts pulsating.

00:00:44.216 --> 00:00:47.450
When it pulsates, the antibodies know 
there’s some emergency,

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:49.689
and they get prepared for it.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.158
Now this is such a normal thing 
to happen to people.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.020
But the insecurities can be of the worst type,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.750
and when these insecurities develop,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.750
people can develop all kinds 
of diseases of the lungs;

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.500
specially the women develop

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.950
what you call as the breast cancer.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.780
Mostly these women are insecure:

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.710
maybe their husbands are not good, 
or they feel

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:15.700
that the husband may leave them alone 
or something like that.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.620
There are certain insecurities that are built in.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:21.730
They might be quite frightened people, 
personalities.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.929
I have seen most of the air-hostesses

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.029
have this center heart catching,

00:01:26.156 --> 00:01:29.186
because they are afraid they may 
miss the plane or I don’t know,

00:01:29.267 --> 00:01:31.750
they have to be on the job and run and do.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.649
Mostly these time-bound jobs

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:38.229
cause you a trouble here of the center heart,

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.949
and this center heart is very important,

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.869
because for women specially, 
they have to be secured.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.189
If their motherhood is challenged 
then they are even worse.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.494
And this is how one has to understand,

00:01:49.575 --> 00:01:51.939
a woman should be very much respected

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.440
if she is your wife, she’s 
your child or anything.

00:01:55.521 --> 00:01:58.859
She has to be respected 
and given all the security.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.979
It’s the woman who makes the society,

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.889
it's the woman who creates the children,

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.209
it's the woman who looks after the children.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.139
So the men have to give 
all the security and the protection

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.489
to the womenhood and understand 
that is a very important factor,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.169
which if we neglect we can have 
lots of problems with our society;

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.749
and the women will start competing with men

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.150
and then the society will be all dislocated.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.499
So the center on the left side and the right side

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.859
are the centers of your father, 
of your mother and your father.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.979
If there’s any problem with your father,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.209
then the right side catches 
and it gives you asthma.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.516
First of all you are, we can say,

00:02:41.597 --> 00:02:43.701
vulnerable to asthma, due to bad liver.

00:02:43.782 --> 00:02:45.729
Plus if you have problems with your father

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.549
or if with your fatherhood -

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:49.469
supposing you are an unhappy father,

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.379
or maybe that you are not looking 
after your children,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.179
then you get this center caught up very badly.

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:57.251
Then on the left side is the mother’s,

00:02:57.332 --> 00:03:00.035
and the mother’s thing is that when some mothers

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.187
are not good mothers; also children can get this.

00:03:03.268 --> 00:03:09.309
Or when the children are not nice 
to the mother, they also get it.

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.829
So mother and father are very 
important factors in Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.035
and you have to understand

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:19.106
that if your parents have been unkind to you,

00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:21.585
you must forgive them. Just forget about them.

00:03:21.666 --> 00:03:24.391
Because they have given you birth, 
you should be thankful,

00:03:24.472 --> 00:03:25.939
and just forget about them.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.740
That’s the best way to get over the problem 
of left and right heart.
