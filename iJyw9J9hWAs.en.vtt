ADVICE ON VIBRATORY PERCEPTION

00:15.927 --> 00:18.684
Question: Some Sahaja Yogis who have been
in Sahaja Yoga

00:18.885 --> 00:21.051
for a long time, they don't feel the cool
breeze,

00:21.252 --> 00:24.996
they don't feel any catches. Some people
feel burning or (...).

00:25.212 --> 00:29.195
Some people feel (...) in their heads,
in their body or in the hands.

00:29.396 --> 00:35.794
Is there a way we can develop to feel
things, all of us

00:35.995 --> 00:40.546
all over or it is just some people feel...

00:41.189 --> 00:43.909
Shri Mataji: No, no. You see, to begin
with, you see,

00:44.110 --> 00:46.962
it has something to do with your nervous
system, all right?

00:47.163 --> 00:50.707
So if your nervous system is disturbed,
you may not feel, at all.

00:50.908 --> 00:53.176
For the nervous system, best thing is to do
massage.

00:53.377 --> 00:56.083
You see, somebody should massage their
back, hands.

00:56.284 --> 01:00.598
Also I have told many a times that you rub
your hands with vibrated olive oil

01:00.799 --> 01:03.919
quite a lot, and rub these things so they
become sensitive.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.811
Could be with insensitivity;

01:06.012 --> 01:09.191
but if they can feel the catches
in the body,

01:09.392 --> 01:12.179
that means they’re all right, only their
Vishuddhi is not all right.

01:12.380 --> 01:15.874
Rub the thing on the Vishuddhi. Work
on Vishuddhi, clear it out.

01:16.075 --> 01:19.732
And for Vishuddhi, if you can use, say,
butter,

01:19.933 --> 01:24.394
to rub on the here and rub all these
muscles, you see, with that,

01:24.595 --> 01:26.731
all these things will work out for your
hand.

01:26.932 --> 01:31.619
But supposing there’s no cool breeze coming
out of the head, possibly,

01:31.820 --> 01:34.003
then the Realization is not yet
established.

01:34.204 --> 01:36.700
See, other people should say whether
there’s a cool breeze coming,

01:36.901 --> 01:38.927
because the person who is not realized
may not feel it.

01:39.128 --> 01:42.172
Supposing he does not feel it and you feel
it, then he is realized;

01:42.373 --> 01:44.183
only thing, his chakras are to be cleared
out.

01:44.384 --> 01:48.310
It’s a different, different category
of people. Then there are some people

01:48.503 --> 01:51.252
whose Kundalini has not risen, there are
still Sahaja Yogis like that.

01:51.453 --> 01:53.855
Maybe, I don’t know if there are any.

01:54.056 --> 01:58.157
Those people who are unmarried for long,
they are very difficult people,

01:58.358 --> 02:02.069
because they never feel the cool breeze
in the hand, quite a lot, like that.

02:02.270 --> 02:05.353
But it is not so, they are realized souls.
In any case, they may not feel it,

02:05.554 --> 02:08.793
but they are realized souls, you see,
because a kind of a softness,

02:08.994 --> 02:13.094
a kind of a balance is developed after
marriage which is not there.

02:13.295 --> 02:15.800
And that’s how some people don’t feel it.

02:16.001 --> 02:19.931
There are various reasons. Some people who
are ego-oriented more,

02:20.132 --> 02:23.672
they should turn their left to the right
many a times. They should find out,

02:23.873 --> 02:27.022
from the hands, you see. One hand is
bigger, one hand is smaller –

02:27.223 --> 02:29.270
that means the left hand, if it is smaller,

02:29.471 --> 02:31.374
that means you have to raise left
to the right.

02:31.575 --> 02:34.980
You see, from the size of the hands and all
that you can see. Putting one hand

02:35.181 --> 02:38.763
towards the photograph, another hand
outside. Work it out in so many ways,

02:38.964 --> 02:42.473
because you have permutations and
combinations of certain mistakes.

02:42.674 --> 02:45.521
But that doesn’t mean you develop this
left Vishuddhi by any chance,

02:45.722 --> 02:47.286
because that’s the worst thing that can
happen.

02:47.487 --> 02:52.480
If you develop the left Vishuddhi, then it’s
a very difficult situation for you people.

02:55.281 --> 03:00.379
Now, for this kind of a thing I think

03:00.580 --> 03:04.667
I'll give you a complete lecture on one
day, complete,

03:04.868 --> 03:08.532
as to see what permutations and
combinations of different chakras

03:08.733 --> 03:12.419
can create. All right?

03:15.391 --> 03:19.821
But symptoms are outside. The symptoms
are mostly outside. There’s no need to…

03:20.022 --> 03:24.330
from a personality you can see what it is
he is catching, you see.

03:26.565 --> 03:31.819
Is a very great problem with people, that
they don’t feel the vibrations.

03:32.020 --> 03:34.164
Some people just don’t feel.

03:34.365 --> 03:38.033
How many there are like that, who never
feel any vibrations,

03:38.234 --> 03:42.498
never felt? Never. Raise your hands. I know
Kevin. Kevin: Not never.

03:42.699 --> 03:45.571
Shri Mataji: You never – you have felt it
sometimes? Kevin: Oh, yes.

03:45.772 --> 03:49.629
Shri Mataji: All right. Yogi: Mother, since
I’ve been to the ashram, I mean,

03:49.830 --> 03:52.173
my hands feel very hot all the time.

03:52.374 --> 03:54.651
Shri Mataji: Which one?
Yogi: But I feel the catches inside.

03:54.852 --> 04:00.268
Shri Mataji: Both the hands are. What work
you’re doing in the ashram?

04:01.321 --> 04:03.621
Yogi: Not very much, Mother.
Shri Mataji: All right,

04:03.822 --> 04:06.153
you had a left side catch. All right?
You can see it clearly,

04:06.354 --> 04:10.172
your right hand is very shiny. The left,
there is a problem.

04:10.373 --> 04:13.678
You see, these fingers are not so shiny
as the things are.

04:13.879 --> 04:18.384
You had a left side problem, if you remember
it. All right? So, that’s fighting.

04:18.585 --> 04:20.970
In the ashram the vibrations are fighting,
that’s why you feel hot.

04:21.171 --> 04:23.925
There’s nothing wrong with it. It will
correct; it will have cool breeze.

04:24.126 --> 04:27.271
Put your right hand always up and left hand
towards Me.

04:27.472 --> 04:30.522
It will correct.
