00:29.820 --> 00:34.200
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:37.200 --> 00:41.690
Speaking before the doctors,

00:42.360 --> 00:44.320
I think of My college days,

00:44.530 --> 00:47.360
while I was also studying medicine

00:47.610 --> 00:54.400
but luckily or unluckily our college stopped completely,

00:55.950 --> 00:59.530
in Lahore and I had to give up My studies.

01:01.360 --> 01:07.030
Not that I had no faith in this western education of medicine

01:07.450 --> 01:12.450
but it was a good chance by connecting this to that

01:12.780 --> 01:19.740
and understanding what is missing in the western medical education.

01:24.070 --> 01:29.990
The missing point is this,

01:30.690 --> 01:37.610
that human beings are considered in the medical science

01:37.900 --> 01:40.950
as something very individual

01:41.200 --> 01:44.690
and not connected with the whole.

01:45.110 --> 01:48.150
We are all connected with the whole.

01:48.490 --> 01:51.240
But how to convince people

01:51.490 --> 01:54.650
that you are all connected with the whole

01:57.320 --> 02:03.360
and that you are not singled out?

02:03.820 --> 02:07.240
As we are connected with the whole

02:07.490 --> 02:12.450
all our problems are connected with the whole.

02:12.860 --> 02:17.860
You cannot just consider somebody as the patient of one thing

02:18.110 --> 02:21.280
and another patient of another thing,

02:21.690 --> 02:26.110
could be that one person who has one trouble,

02:26.360 --> 02:29.820
could be having so many other troubles,

02:30.200 --> 02:32.280
so many other connections

02:32.530 --> 02:37.950
which we do not locate in the western medical sience.

02:39.280 --> 02:45.820
For example, to see a person

02:46.360 --> 02:51.570
medically very sick, may be,

02:51.950 --> 02:55.690
but you don't know, what is his mental condition?

02:55.990 --> 02:57.950
What is he doing mentally?

02:58.200 --> 02:59.950
Is he all right mentally

03:00.150 --> 03:06.650
or only he is physically something wrong with him?

03:07.400 --> 03:13.030
Now absolutely we know about so many things, like say,

03:16.320 --> 03:19.780
medically we have names for that,

03:20.030 --> 03:24.320
that this is a psychosomatic problem

03:24.570 --> 03:28.280
or this is a somatic problem,

03:28.530 --> 03:34.320
but what is the relationship between the two that we don't know.

03:34.820 --> 03:41.070
You'll be amazed most of our diseases come from psychosomatic,

03:41.690 --> 03:47.320
like cancer, which are incurable mostly, cancer

03:47.570 --> 03:51.070
and we can say AIDS,

03:51.820 --> 03:57.320
all such which are supposed to be absolutely incurable

03:57.820 --> 03:59.450
and difficult,

03:59.650 --> 04:04.110
all that come with our connection, with our connection,

04:04.400 --> 04:05.950
which we are not sure of,

04:06.200 --> 04:10.490
with the left side. As we, you have seen here  in picture, left side,

04:10.700 --> 04:12.860
I don't know.

04:13.360 --> 04:16.530
We know only the right side medical science

04:16.740 --> 04:20.110
and that too in such details,

04:21.570 --> 04:24.400
it is not necessary,

04:25.950 --> 04:30.360
you must also know the left side of a human being

04:30.650 --> 04:35.740
and about left side we are absolutely not aware.

04:36.860 --> 04:42.360
For example, a person who is mad,

04:43.200 --> 04:47.530
lunatic, he is in the lunatic asylum.

04:49.780 --> 04:53.570
He doesn't get heart trouble, why?

04:59.320 --> 05:05.570
How has he got mad? What is his connection

05:06.030 --> 05:09.320
with ourselves?

05:09.900 --> 05:15.530
For example, you take a patient

05:15.740 --> 05:18.860
who is suffering, say, from cancer.

05:20.530 --> 05:24.070
We know a lot about cancer, no doubt,

05:24.450 --> 05:28.820
how virus is started and all that, that we know.

05:29.070 --> 05:32.740
But how cancer is caused no one knows

05:32.950 --> 05:37.530
and to what type of people cancer comes in, you don't know.

05:38.740 --> 05:45.740
Now these are two, as you see, there are two channels within us,

05:46.110 --> 05:51.200
one looks after the right side and one looks after the left side.

05:51.650 --> 05:55.990
Now if you have a problem in the left side

05:56.280 --> 06:03.280
then problems psychosomatic can come in.

06:03.860 --> 06:07.900
Supposing, your hand is broken or

06:08.110 --> 06:13.650
is there some sort of a physical problem then it's all right.

06:13.860 --> 06:18.490
But when it is the complicated psychosomatic trouble

06:18.740 --> 06:21.990
then doctors cannot cure it, I am sorry to say.

06:22.240 --> 06:26.780
Because you don't know the other side of side of it,

06:27.110 --> 06:33.240
what is affecting the patient to get this cancer, you don't know.

06:34.690 --> 06:38.150
You will be happy to know in Sahaja Yoga

06:39.070 --> 06:42.200
cancer is curable,

06:43.610 --> 06:46.070
curable if it is at a very early stage

06:46.320 --> 06:49.860
it's very easy but otherwise also.

06:50.320 --> 06:53.450
Specially blood cancer

06:54.400 --> 06:58.070
is absolutely curable.

06:58.570 --> 07:02.400
You will be amazed that it is

07:02.650 --> 07:08.780
such a combination of these two sides of our life,

07:09.070 --> 07:13.240
that we get into these diseases which are incurable.

07:13.490 --> 07:16.530
There is a big list of these incurable diseases

07:16.700 --> 07:18.360
which I don't want to tell you

07:18.650 --> 07:20.650
which you know very well.

07:20.820 --> 07:26.240
So in all of them there is a complication of the left side.

07:26.650 --> 07:29.280
Of course you know about right side very much,

07:29.530 --> 07:34.400
Gray's anatomy and after that all you know, but

07:34.690 --> 07:39.610
you don't know how you get affected by the left side.

07:40.320 --> 07:45.950
So in this lecture, I would like to tell you something about the left side,

07:46.240 --> 07:52.450
which you have never heard of maybe, and you don't believe into.

07:53.150 --> 07:57.820
The left side belongs to our past,

07:58.530 --> 08:02.820
to our past in the sense that

08:03.530 --> 08:09.650
those people who are futuristic do not get affected by left side,

08:10.030 --> 08:12.690
but those people who live in the left side,

08:12.950 --> 08:14.780
are worried about their left side,

08:14.990 --> 08:18.690
are sorry for themselves, whatever it is,

08:19.070 --> 08:22.900
they are the ones who get affected.

08:25.320 --> 08:30.030
Left sided person if I tell you, you will be shocked to hear,

08:30.240 --> 08:33.700
is actually possessed.

08:33.950 --> 08:40.150
Possessed by some dead spirit which must be a knowledge to you.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.280
You may not be believing in it but it is.

08:45.650 --> 08:50.570
It can happen to anyone who gets

08:50.820 --> 08:56.820
sad or gets into the left sided temperament,

08:57.400 --> 09:02.280
Also there are so many other things like these false gurus,

09:02.530 --> 09:05.200
what they do, they mesmerize,

09:05.490 --> 09:07.320
mesmerize you with

09:07.570 --> 09:10.780
dead  spirits which they have to control.

09:11.110 --> 09:13.490
This side

09:14.070 --> 09:17.530
of, I should say, not medicine non-medicine,

09:17.740 --> 09:22.150
but whatever it is, should be known to the doctors;

09:22.450 --> 09:26.490
otherwise you cannot do any curing.

09:26.820 --> 09:29.650
You can, maybe, diagnosis you might do.

09:29.860 --> 09:31.990
But you cannot cure people

09:32.200 --> 09:35.490
who are suffering from psychosomatic troubles.

09:35.700 --> 09:39.110
Today's medical problem is that

09:39.360 --> 09:45.570
they cannot cure psychosomatic diseases.

09:45.950 --> 09:47.740
For that you don't have to spend so many years,

09:47.990 --> 09:50.280
as we do for MBBS.

09:50.490 --> 09:55.280
It's a very, very short course, if you can do that.

09:55.860 --> 10:01.740
Firstly, you should be connected to the divine force,

10:02.070 --> 10:06.240
that's very important, that's not difficult at all,

10:06.490 --> 10:13.490
but after that you have to maintain your spiritual abilities.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.780
One of the spiritual ability is innocence,

10:19.490 --> 10:23.070
the first chakra that you see

10:23.570 --> 10:26.650
is innocence.

10:27.450 --> 10:29.700
If you are a innocent person,

10:29.950 --> 10:35.490
you can easily cure all such people who are suffering

10:35.700 --> 10:39.690
from such incurable diseases.

10:41.400 --> 10:46.700
I would say that one should first of all

10:47.030 --> 10:50.900
try to get self realization, that's important.

10:51.150 --> 10:55.610
When the Kundalini rises, She pierces through your fontanel bone area

10:55.820 --> 11:00.110
and you are connected with the divine force which is all over.

11:00.450 --> 11:05.360
You need not believe Me, but you get your selfrealization

11:05.650 --> 11:08.530
If you have your self realization,

11:08.740 --> 11:11.360
then you will be capable to understand

11:11.570 --> 11:17.610
what sort of combination your patient has.

11:18.610 --> 11:21.150
Is he only physically suffering

11:21.400 --> 11:26.780
or he has this combination of left side?

11:29.150 --> 11:33.490
The other day I was surprised, a child came to Me,

11:33.780 --> 11:37.650
he was suffering from meningitis.

11:38.610 --> 11:40.610
He got cured

11:41.950 --> 11:46.950
and the parents didn't understand how did he get cured.

11:47.360 --> 11:50.740
Then when the boy got cured I asked him:

11:51.200 --> 11:53.610
"Who is your friend?"

11:54.110 --> 11:59.320
He said, this particular boy, who has a particular guru.

11:59.610 --> 12:00.820
All right.

12:01.070 --> 12:03.570
And I go in his house

12:03.780 --> 12:08.740
and go on watching that guru all the time, can you imagine?

12:10.110 --> 12:12.990
There are many doctors also

12:13.320 --> 12:17.320
who get involved with these bad gurus.

12:17.740 --> 12:22.070
You must know, unless and until you are realized,

12:22.400 --> 12:29.320
you will not know who is truthful and who is correct.

12:30.450 --> 12:33.860
An innocent boy suffering from meningitis

12:34.070 --> 12:37.400
and overnight he got cured.

12:38.570 --> 12:41.280
You'll be amazed at

12:43.360 --> 12:47.360
the great experience of Sahaja Yoga

12:47.690 --> 12:51.150
and it is too great a surprise,

12:51.400 --> 12:54.030
that's why people don't accept it.

12:54.280 --> 12:57.990
But we have many cases by which we can show,

12:58.240 --> 13:03.070
that people who were supposed to be incurable are cured.

13:06.030 --> 13:12.650
So many people, especially with serious diseases, like cancer.

13:13.690 --> 13:16.320
I mean in the medical science for cancer,

13:16.530 --> 13:18.690
they will go on like this, like that,

13:18.900 --> 13:21.950
till they shave you off completely.

13:22.860 --> 13:24.690
But not in Sahaja Yoga,

13:24.900 --> 13:28.950
immediately you will know that this man is possessed.

13:29.240 --> 13:33.570
Now this line to Medical Science is absolutely not there,

13:33.780 --> 13:37.610
but in our country we always believed in that.

13:38.030 --> 13:40.280
We have certain rules and regulations

13:40.530 --> 13:44.280
about people who are dead. How to behave?

13:44.530 --> 13:47.240
How to go to Shamshan (MEANS Cremation ground)

13:47.490 --> 13:52.450
and all that. There is a particular type of

13:53.400 --> 13:55.900
understanding

13:56.450 --> 14:00.530
of all these dead bodies,

14:00.780 --> 14:02.860
how they behave, Where do they go?

14:03.110 --> 14:06.650
And is I think a very big part

14:06.860 --> 14:10.990
of your knowledge, very big part.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.490
So many diseases, incurable, you cannot cure,

14:15.700 --> 14:18.950
which are mostly coming from the left side.

14:19.200 --> 14:21.650
Medical science can cure the right side.

14:21.860 --> 14:24.400
I know that, that they can do it.

14:24.690 --> 14:28.820
But cancer they will go on postponing from one to another,

14:29.070 --> 14:33.950
they'll operate, then it will spread, this and that.

14:34.240 --> 14:38.990
Operation is not the way to cure, it's not.

14:39.650 --> 14:44.990
If you are expert  in Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to operate.

14:45.280 --> 14:49.110
Overnight you can cure, overnight you can cure

14:49.360 --> 14:51.360
cancer patient, believe Me.

14:51.570 --> 14:55.360
You are quite capable of doing that. Especially Indians,

14:55.650 --> 14:59.110
because Indians have a special capacity.

14:59.360 --> 15:04.150
I should say what special blessing of this country.

15:04.400 --> 15:08.200
We don't know this country how great it is,

15:08.490 --> 15:12.860
but we are only dealing with the western education,

15:13.240 --> 15:18.530
where have they reached, these western people in their experiments,

15:18.740 --> 15:20.690
I just don't understand.

15:20.900 --> 15:23.900
Their children are taking to drugs,

15:24.490 --> 15:27.200
their families are disturbed,

15:27.450 --> 15:30.030
everything is so upset.

15:30.240 --> 15:34.450
Not that I decry this education, not at all.

15:34.690 --> 15:37.690
But it is not complete

15:37.950 --> 15:40.950
and you should have the other side of it.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.150
Otherwise, don't have a cancer altogether.

15:45.400 --> 15:50.740
Only have physical things

15:50.990 --> 15:53.610
by which you will work it out

15:53.820 --> 15:56.860
but if you want to have

15:57.150 --> 16:00.200
patients of all types,

16:00.570 --> 16:03.530
then you must know the other side.

16:03.740 --> 16:08.240
There is nothing to be frightened, nothing to be upset,

16:08.450 --> 16:12.030
but it's a knowledge which you should have as doctors,

16:12.280 --> 16:16.950
because I think the medical science  is still not complete

16:17.150 --> 16:21.150
that as Doctor Aggarwal himself has said it.

16:21.400 --> 16:27.690
But what is lacking in it, the know- ledge of the left side that we have.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.650
Now if I should say that

16:31.820 --> 16:34.530
I didn't read it in any book,

16:34.740 --> 16:36.780
I didn't get it from any book,

16:37.030 --> 16:39.400
but only when I was

16:39.610 --> 16:43.860
working with Sahaja Yoga, with people, I discovered

16:44.320 --> 16:46.530
that compared to India, western people

16:46.740 --> 16:50.150
are much more affected by the left side, much more.

16:52.030 --> 16:55.740
much more. And they cannot understand

16:55.950 --> 17:00.690
how they are sick, what has happened to them.

17:00.990 --> 17:05.950
Even if you take a very limited area of treatment

17:06.240 --> 17:10.150
of a human welfare

17:10.570 --> 17:16.320
then is a very important part is the left side

17:16.900 --> 17:20.030
Supposing a lady who is all the time crying

17:20.280 --> 17:23.490
and weeping and unhappy,

17:23.740 --> 17:26.690
she can get cancer.

17:29.990 --> 17:32.110
Now there are two types,

17:32.360 --> 17:34.740
one also right sided diseases,

17:35.030 --> 17:37.320
one is of course the left side.

17:37.530 --> 17:39.650
In the right sided people,

17:39.820 --> 17:44.070
who are extremely, I should say, aggressive,

17:44.360 --> 17:49.240
extremely overpowering, controlling type,

17:49.450 --> 17:52.610
of course they have a very bad liver, I must say.

17:52.860 --> 17:55.690
They have a very bad liver

17:55.900 --> 18:02.070
and when they get like that they cross all the limits

18:02.530 --> 18:04.860
and when they cross all the limits

18:05.110 --> 18:11.280
they get such diseases which you cannot find out, you cannot cure.

18:12.690 --> 18:15.990
One of them is the disease of the liver,

18:16.280 --> 18:20.690
I think doctors can't cure liver. They may try,

18:20.950 --> 18:25.990
but can't cure liver as Sahaja Yoga can cure.

18:27.820 --> 18:31.490
And such a person  whose temperament, he's so hot tempered

18:31.740 --> 18:35.280
and he's  so aggressive and this and that,

18:35.700 --> 18:41.610
he suffers from that horrible liver

18:41.860 --> 18:46.110
and develops all kinds of complications.

18:48.610 --> 18:50.570
There are so many other diseases also

18:50.740 --> 18:53.320
on the right side, so many other.

18:53.570 --> 18:57.610
But mainly I think is a disease of the liver.

18:57.780 --> 19:00.780
Liver is lived with.

19:01.150 --> 19:06.400
And if your liver is out, there is no solution in the allopathy.

19:06.610 --> 19:10.570
May be little bit here and little bit there.

19:11.610 --> 19:14.400
But at the climax of it,

19:14.740 --> 19:20.360
with the liver one can faint, one can even die.

19:23.700 --> 19:27.820
In the West, liver problem is very common

19:29.780 --> 19:33.860
and there is no solution for them for that.

19:34.780 --> 19:36.610
They go on living with it

19:36.780 --> 19:41.780
and doctors just admit them in the hospital.

19:43.610 --> 19:47.030
These are not incurable, they are absolutely curable.

19:47.280 --> 19:50.650
Because we haven't got that knowledge

19:50.900 --> 19:57.570
and that's why we call them incurable. No, they're not.

19:58.450 --> 20:00.860
I do not want to blame other diseases,

20:01.110 --> 20:06.690
but there are so many of them, which cannot be even diagnosed

20:06.900 --> 20:11.070
and which cannot be cured by the medical science.

20:11.360 --> 20:14.490
Which we must accept first of all,

20:14.740 --> 20:16.820
that that is the situation.

20:17.070 --> 20:21.320
We may go on trying doing anything

20:21.570 --> 20:23.450
but we cannot cure.

20:23.690 --> 20:27.820
So many types of medicines will come out, we cannot cure.

20:28.150 --> 20:30.450
Because what I am trying to tell you

20:30.650 --> 20:32.110
that's only half part

20:32.320 --> 20:37.070
of your being is discussed.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.400
In that also so many things are not there.

20:41.690 --> 20:44.450
Take it for example asthma,

20:44.690 --> 20:49.110
asthma cannot be cured by doctors, is a fact

20:49.450 --> 20:53.690
but Sahaja Yoga can absolutely cure

20:53.990 --> 20:57.280
Allergies also can be cured by us.

20:57.530 --> 21:02.070
Because if you have the roots of all the troubles,

21:02.400 --> 21:04.690
if you know about the roots,

21:04.900 --> 21:08.530
not pharmaceutical and all that but real roots,

21:08.740 --> 21:12.990
then you  can handle the situation and you can cure.

21:13.280 --> 21:18.360
We haven't got any yet a college or anything so far in Sahaja Yoga.

21:18.610 --> 21:22.950
I wish we could. But hospital we have.

21:23.280 --> 21:28.400
We have a hospital in Belapur, they call it

21:28.950 --> 21:33.320
New Bombay, where they are treating people.

21:33.570 --> 21:36.280
Only they have to pay for their stay

21:36.530 --> 21:40.490
and it's hardly I think 300 rupees per day

21:40.690 --> 21:46.700
for poor people. But you don't need any medicine,

21:47.070 --> 21:49.650
you don't have to pay for anything.

21:49.860 --> 21:52.690
For our country which is so poor,

21:52.950 --> 21:55.490
don't you think, it's very important?

21:55.740 --> 21:59.070
Otherwise you go for X-ray,

21:59.320 --> 22:02.690
then you go for another test,

22:02.900 --> 22:07.900
then for another test and nothing comes out of it.

22:09.690 --> 22:14.990
One should only know how to deal with it.

22:16.700 --> 22:21.200
Now supposing somebody's leg is broken - finished,

22:21.450 --> 22:26.900
cut his leg, put another leg. No need,

22:27.450 --> 22:30.650
I assure you there is no need.

22:31.280 --> 22:36.240
Now we have some doctors in Sahaja Yoga, very good.

22:36.530 --> 22:40.030
Some of them are in America, some of them are in Italy

22:40.320 --> 22:43.530
and some of them are in Russia.

22:43.740 --> 22:45.690
Russian doctors are very good.

22:45.900 --> 22:48.240
I don't know how they think

22:48.450 --> 22:51.650
that there is something beyond this education

22:51.900 --> 22:54.530
and they are trying to learn it.

22:55.320 --> 22:57.530
If you can make any facility,

22:57.740 --> 22:59.950
I will be very happy but in any case

23:00.150 --> 23:02.150
I am thinking of starting

23:02.360 --> 23:06.610
a Sahaja Yoga hospital in your country

23:06.820 --> 23:09.280
specially in Delhi,

23:09.610 --> 23:12.150
in Greater Noida

23:13.900 --> 23:18.610
and if some of your doctors can join us

23:18.820 --> 23:21.320
help us a lot.

23:21.740 --> 23:25.950
In Greater Noida I am thinking of starting

23:26.200 --> 23:29.360
a college or we can call it a school

23:29.610 --> 23:33.780
we'll get the students as well as doctors

23:34.030 --> 23:38.690
who can cure people. And there will be...

23:40.150 --> 23:42.490
And there will be no charges for treatment.

23:42.690 --> 23:46.200
Of course, where they stay, if they come and stay there

23:46.450 --> 23:49.570
then they might have to pay for  their food, that's all.

23:49.860 --> 23:52.650
Otherwise this is an arrangement I am having

23:52.860 --> 23:57.570
and anybody who wants to join as a doctor, also

23:57.820 --> 24:01.530
we'll like to accept their services.

24:02.070 --> 24:05.820
How much will be the pay I don't now, but not much I would say,

24:06.070 --> 24:10.690
we'll pay about 6000 to 7000 per month to a doctor.

24:10.990 --> 24:12.780
But he has to be a Sahaja yogi

24:13.030 --> 24:16.400
and he should know the method of Sahaja Yoga.

24:16.700 --> 24:19.700
I think, it is one of

24:20.200 --> 24:23.860
the very generous feeling

24:24.150 --> 24:27.570
that in our country so many die

24:27.740 --> 24:32.200
because they cannot get into the hospital, they cannot get treated.

24:33.740 --> 24:39.360
If you can give some time to this project of Mine,

24:39.610 --> 24:45.320
I am sure I'll be able to organize a good hospital

24:45.610 --> 24:48.860
for those people. In that we'll have

24:49.110 --> 24:52.820
somatic patients as well as psychosomatic patients

24:53.240 --> 24:55.610
all kinds of patients we'll have.

24:55.820 --> 24:58.530
And you will learn so much

24:58.700 --> 25:02.950
because it's a very subtle and deep knowledge.

25:03.150 --> 25:08.690
Just cannot learn it on the book, you have to have experiment

25:08.860 --> 25:12.070
with the patient. You will be amazed,

25:12.280 --> 25:14.490
how you will be curing people.

25:14.690 --> 25:19.320
It´s not book of knowledge, it's a very, very practical knowledge

25:19.570 --> 25:25.610
and those who have that charitable temperament

25:25.820 --> 25:28.950
can do very well and learn a lot.

25:29.200 --> 25:31.690
One thing I must tell you

25:31.860 --> 25:35.400
Sahaja Yoga has one bad point also,

25:35.650 --> 25:39.950
that you cannot make money, you cannot.

25:40.200 --> 25:43.990
If you try making money out of it, you fail.

25:44.280 --> 25:48.780
Some or other this money business is little higher

25:48.990 --> 25:52.530
for Sahaja Yogis, they cannot manage with it.

25:52.860 --> 25:55.900
But you can give service.

25:56.360 --> 26:03.400
Now we had a very nice retired doctor in this Belapur hospital

26:03.690 --> 26:05.860
and he did very well,

26:06.070 --> 26:09.070
now he is no more. He worked very hard

26:09.280 --> 26:13.070
but his daughter in law is now looking after that.

26:14.070 --> 26:17.570
If you want, if you are retired people,

26:17.780 --> 26:20.070
if you are not in need of money

26:20.280 --> 26:24.570
much money then it's a very good thing.

26:25.400 --> 26:30.900
Also we provide, say, a residence,

26:31.280 --> 26:36.070
food, everything, can be managed, it's not so difficult,

26:36.280 --> 26:40.150
but it's not a very money oriented

26:40.450 --> 26:44.150
I must say since I was studying medical,

26:44.400 --> 26:49.320
now medical line has become very money oriented,

26:49.530 --> 26:51.950
I am surprised. I am sorry to say,

26:52.150 --> 26:54.280
but they have become very money oriented

26:54.450 --> 26:56.990
and some of your doctors have gone to America

26:57.200 --> 26:59.860
and have befooled people so much

27:00.070 --> 27:04.400
and have made so much money that you feel ashamed to be an Indian,

27:04.610 --> 27:05.450
it's like that.

27:05.650 --> 27:07.280
You can't make much money

27:07.490 --> 27:11.780
but as retired people you can join us and help us

27:12.030 --> 27:15.030
and some of you can come to learn Sahaja Yoga.

27:15.280 --> 27:19.150
Hardly within say months time you will be experts.

27:19.400 --> 27:23.530
You can diagnose the thing without any delay.

27:23.740 --> 27:26.900
You don't have to go to any laboratory or anything,

27:27.150 --> 27:30.240
immediately you will know what's the trouble.

27:30.490 --> 27:34.900
And all sorts of incurable diseases you can try.

27:35.150 --> 27:41.070
I am amazed Myself as to how it is working with people.

27:42.070 --> 27:44.740
Now all these awards and all that they have given Me

27:44.990 --> 27:47.860
because I have cured people and done that

27:48.070 --> 27:50.610
but I don't have a hospital there.

27:50.780 --> 27:55.740
First hospital I want to have in Delhi and here I want to work it out.

27:55.950 --> 28:00.610
Let us think of working it out ourselves.

28:00.780 --> 28:06.320
It's a charitable hospital and it's very sensible,

28:06.490 --> 28:09.320
I have already got money to build,

28:09.530 --> 28:14.280
but only thing I need some doctors who can help Me,

28:14.530 --> 28:16.570
it´s a very stunning thing Sahaja Yoga,

28:16.740 --> 28:19.530
if you come you will be amazed how it works.

28:19.700 --> 28:21.110
I know

28:21.450 --> 28:24.900
never been that, we have never been connected to the divine.

28:25.200 --> 28:27.990
We have never used that forces of the divine

28:28.240 --> 28:33.860
and once you start using those forces you will be amazed at yourself.

28:34.610 --> 28:38.650
It is said that you should find out who you are,

28:39.950 --> 28:45.240
that's not possible unless and until you have your selfrealization.

28:45.490 --> 28:48.990
Today in our country we need self realized people

28:49.240 --> 28:52.650
all kinds of problems can be solved.

28:52.860 --> 28:55.690
Every type of,

28:55.990 --> 28:59.530
I should say, quarrelling is going on.

28:59.700 --> 29:03.360
Because you become a collective person,

29:04.280 --> 29:09.110
you become a personality of a collective nature,

29:09.320 --> 29:12.780
no more fighting no more is needed. I have many

29:12.990 --> 29:15.360
Muslim countries who have got realization,

29:15.610 --> 29:22.320
Turkey, this Benin, there is another one called as Ivory Coast.

29:22.530 --> 29:25.240
There are seven countries that side,

29:25.450 --> 29:28.070
they are all Muslims converted,

29:28.320 --> 29:31.950
or rather transformed into Sahaja Yoga.

29:32.200 --> 29:36.110
In this all the integration of all the religions take place,

29:36.400 --> 29:39.280
understanding of the

29:39.490 --> 29:43.860
human abilities,

29:44.240 --> 29:47.690
human personality and respect.

29:47.860 --> 29:52.400
I mean it's a very different atmosphere into which you get,

29:53.070 --> 29:57.200
it's a very different level of awareness, as you were saying,

29:57.450 --> 30:02.490
where you become so peaceful, silent,

30:02.740 --> 30:06.110
yet so sweet.

30:06.690 --> 30:08.400
So I don't know in this short lecture

30:08.690 --> 30:10.820
how much can I tell you about Sahaja Yoga

30:11.070 --> 30:14.360
bur it is a very miraculous thing.

30:14.570 --> 30:17.950
And please try to get your self realization,

30:18.200 --> 30:22.780
he has Me, I think, I will try if I can do that.

30:26.820 --> 30:31.400
There is one small thing; you have to take out your shoes.

30:33.450 --> 30:38.240
In England first time I asked them to take out your shoes they walked off.

30:38.860 --> 30:42.240
English cannot live without their shoes, I think.

30:44.030 --> 30:46.610
Please take out your shoes.

30:49.860 --> 30:55.200
Those who don't want to have can leave. There's no force on anyone.

30:58.860 --> 31:03.570
First of all, have faith in yourself

31:06.990 --> 31:10.280
that you can get self realization.

31:10.610 --> 31:16.690
Please put both the feet on the ground.

31:31.280 --> 31:35.780
Can you put both the hands towards Me like this?

31:44.570 --> 31:48.030
And now please close your eyes, please.

31:56.240 --> 31:59.030
You know a lot about Kundalini,

31:59.240 --> 32:03.320
but now you will find, out what She is.

32:43.950 --> 32:49.450
Please put right hand on top of your fontanel bone area,

32:50.490 --> 32:54.490
which was a soft bone in your childhood, please.

32:59.860 --> 33:03.240
Not touching the head, away from the head.

33:05.740 --> 33:09.280
Now, please put your left hand

33:21.400 --> 33:23.740
on top of your head;

33:30.860 --> 33:33.450
again the right hand.

34:03.740 --> 34:09.860
Now see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area,

34:10.110 --> 34:12.490
could be hot also.

34:15.900 --> 34:19.650
Just see if there is cool breeze,

34:22.820 --> 34:28.610
it could be hot as I told you, doesn't matter.

34:42.320 --> 34:45.900
Now try with the left hand and right hand towards Me.

34:46.450 --> 34:51.240
If there is a cool breeze coming out of...please put down your head.

35:09.780 --> 35:11.200
Haan (MEANS Yes)

35:15.450 --> 35:21.320
There are some left sided people I must tell you, there are some,

35:22.240 --> 35:27.400
but you will find out very soon. Now please open your eyes.

35:28.400 --> 35:33.150
Again put both the hands towards Me, please, like this.

36:02.110 --> 36:05.450
Now in your hands you will feel the cool breeze

36:06.950 --> 36:09.570
or may be the hot.

36:31.070 --> 36:32.820
Both the hands.

36:34.690 --> 36:37.900
Saare doctor ho gaye paar. (All Doctors have achieved their self-realization).

36:38.240 --> 36:40.280
They are Saints or what!

36:40.490 --> 36:45.450
So many have got realization. May God bless you.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.950
May God bless you.

36:53.070 --> 36:56.360
We have some books, I hope, of Sahaja Yoga.

36:56.820 --> 36:59.950
You all can take it and see for yourself

37:00.200 --> 37:06.150
and master this art. It's very good and very simple

37:06.400 --> 37:10.780
and very much necessary in modern times.

37:12.400 --> 37:15.900
As I told you for diagnosis, you  don't have to do anything.

37:16.200 --> 37:18.450
You just will know on your fingertips

37:18.650 --> 37:21.150
what chakras are catching.

37:21.690 --> 37:24.150
Also you'll know how to cure them.

37:24.360 --> 37:27.320
Very simple it is, very simple.

37:30.360 --> 37:31.950
May God bless you!
