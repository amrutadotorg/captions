00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.200
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.690
Speaking before the doctors,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.320
I think of My college days,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.360
while I was also studying medicine

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.400
but luckily or unluckily our college stopped completely,

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:59.530
in Lahore and I had to give up My studies.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:07.030
Not that I had no faith in this western education of medicine

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.450
but it was a good chance by connecting this to that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.740
and understanding what is missing in the western medical education.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.990
The missing point is this,

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:37.610
that human beings are considered in the medical science

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.950
as something very individual

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.690
and not connected with the whole.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.150
We are all connected with the whole.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.240
But how to convince people

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.650
that you are all connected with the whole

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.360
and that you are not singled out?

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.240
As we are connected with the whole

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.450
all our problems are connected with the whole.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.860
You cannot just consider somebody as the patient of one thing

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.280
and another patient of another thing,

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.110
could be that one person who has one trouble,

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.820
could be having so many other troubles,

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.280
so many other connections

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.950
which we do not locate in the western medical sience.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.820
For example, to see a person

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.570
medically very sick, may be,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.690
but you don't know, what is his mental condition?

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:57.950
What is he doing mentally?

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.950
Is he all right mentally

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:06.650
or only he is physically something wrong with him?

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.030
Now absolutely we know about so many things, like say,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.780
medically we have names for that,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.320
that this is a psychosomatic problem

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.280
or this is a somatic problem,

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.320
but what is the relationship between the two that we don't know.

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:41.070
You'll be amazed most of our diseases come from psychosomatic,

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.320
like cancer, which are incurable mostly, cancer

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.070
and we can say AIDS,

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.320
all such which are supposed to be absolutely incurable

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.450
and difficult,

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.110
all that come with our connection, with our connection,

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.950
which we are not sure of,

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.490
with the left side. As we, you have seen here  in picture, left side,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.860
I don't know.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.530
We know only the right side medical science

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:20.110
and that too in such details,

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:24.400
it is not necessary,

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:30.360
you must also know the left side of a human being

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.740
and about left side we are absolutely not aware.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:42.360
For example, a person who is mad,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.530
lunatic, he is in the lunatic asylum.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.570
He doesn't get heart trouble, why?

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:05.570
How has he got mad? What is his connection

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:09.320
with ourselves?

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:15.530
For example, you take a patient

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:18.860
who is suffering, say, from cancer.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:24.070
We know a lot about cancer, no doubt,

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.820
how virus is started and all that, that we know.

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:32.740
But how cancer is caused no one knows

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.530
and to what type of people cancer comes in, you don't know.

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:45.740
Now these are two, as you see, there are two channels within us,

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:51.200
one looks after the right side and one looks after the left side.

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:55.990
Now if you have a problem in the left side

00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.280
then problems psychosomatic can come in.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:07.900
Supposing, your hand is broken or

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.650
is there some sort of a physical problem then it's all right.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.490
But when it is the complicated psychosomatic trouble

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:21.990
then doctors cannot cure it, I am sorry to say.

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:26.780
Because you don't know the other side of side of it,

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.240
what is affecting the patient to get this cancer, you don't know.

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:38.150
You will be happy to know in Sahaja Yoga

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:42.200
cancer is curable,

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.070
curable if it is at a very early stage

00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:49.860
it's very easy but otherwise also.

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.450
Specially blood cancer

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:58.070
is absolutely curable.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.400
You will be amazed that it is

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.780
such a combination of these two sides of our life,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:13.240
that we get into these diseases which are incurable.

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:16.530
There is a big list of these incurable diseases

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:18.360
which I don't want to tell you

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:20.650
which you know very well.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.240
So in all of them there is a complication of the left side.

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.280
Of course you know about right side very much,

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:34.400
Gray's anatomy and after that all you know, but

00:07:34.690 --> 00:07:39.610
you don't know how you get affected by the left side.

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:45.950
So in this lecture, I would like to tell you something about the left side,

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:52.450
which you have never heard of maybe, and you don't believe into.

00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:57.820
The left side belongs to our past,

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:02.820
to our past in the sense that

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:09.650
those people who are futuristic do not get affected by left side,

00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:12.690
but those people who live in the left side,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:14.780
are worried about their left side,

00:08:14.990 --> 00:08:18.690
are sorry for themselves, whatever it is,

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:22.900
they are the ones who get affected.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:30.030
Left sided person if I tell you, you will be shocked to hear,

00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:33.700
is actually possessed.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:40.150
Possessed by some dead spirit which must be a knowledge to you.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:44.280
You may not be believing in it but it is.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.570
It can happen to anyone who gets

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:56.820
sad or gets into the left sided temperament,

00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.280
Also there are so many other things like these false gurus,

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.200
what they do, they mesmerize,

00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.320
mesmerize you with

00:09:07.570 --> 00:09:10.780
dead  spirits which they have to control.

00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:13.490
This side

00:09:14.070 --> 00:09:17.530
of, I should say, not medicine non-medicine,

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:22.150
but whatever it is, should be known to the doctors;

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.490
otherwise you cannot do any curing.

00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.650
You can, maybe, diagnosis you might do.

00:09:29.860 --> 00:09:31.990
But you cannot cure people

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.490
who are suffering from psychosomatic troubles.

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:39.110
Today's medical problem is that

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:45.570
they cannot cure psychosomatic diseases.

00:09:45.950 --> 00:09:47.740
For that you don't have to spend so many years,

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.280
as we do for MBBS.

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:55.280
It's a very, very short course, if you can do that.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:10:01.740
Firstly, you should be connected to the divine force,

00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.240
that's very important, that's not difficult at all,

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:13.490
but after that you have to maintain your spiritual abilities.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.780
One of the spiritual ability is innocence,

00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:23.070
the first chakra that you see

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.650
is innocence.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:29.700
If you are a innocent person,

00:10:29.950 --> 00:10:35.490
you can easily cure all such people who are suffering

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.690
from such incurable diseases.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:46.700
I would say that one should first of all

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:50.900
try to get self realization, that's important.

00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:55.610
When the Kundalini rises, She pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.110
and you are connected with the divine force which is all over.

00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:05.360
You need not believe Me, but you get your selfrealization

00:11:05.650 --> 00:11:08.530
If you have your self realization,

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:11.360
then you will be capable to understand

00:11:11.570 --> 00:11:17.610
what sort of combination your patient has.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:21.150
Is he only physically suffering

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:26.780
or he has this combination of left side?

00:11:29.150 --> 00:11:33.490
The other day I was surprised, a child came to Me,

00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.650
he was suffering from meningitis.

00:11:38.610 --> 00:11:40.610
He got cured

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:46.950
and the parents didn't understand how did he get cured.

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.740
Then when the boy got cured I asked him:

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:53.610
"Who is your friend?"

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.320
He said, this particular boy, who has a particular guru.

00:11:59.610 --> 00:12:00.820
All right.

00:12:01.070 --> 00:12:03.570
And I go in his house

00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.740
and go on watching that guru all the time, can you imagine?

00:12:10.110 --> 00:12:12.990
There are many doctors also

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:17.320
who get involved with these bad gurus.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.070
You must know, unless and until you are realized,

00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:29.320
you will not know who is truthful and who is correct.

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:33.860
An innocent boy suffering from meningitis

00:12:34.070 --> 00:12:37.400
and overnight he got cured.

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:41.280
You'll be amazed at

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.360
the great experience of Sahaja Yoga

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:51.150
and it is too great a surprise,

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:54.030
that's why people don't accept it.

00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.990
But we have many cases by which we can show,

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:03.070
that people who were supposed to be incurable are cured.

00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:12.650
So many people, especially with serious diseases, like cancer.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.320
I mean in the medical science for cancer,

00:13:16.530 --> 00:13:18.690
they will go on like this, like that,

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.950
till they shave you off completely.

00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.690
But not in Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:28.950
immediately you will know that this man is possessed.

00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:33.570
Now this line to Medical Science is absolutely not there,

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:37.610
but in our country we always believed in that.

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.280
We have certain rules and regulations

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:44.280
about people who are dead. How to behave?

00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.240
How to go to Shamshan (MEANS Cremation ground)

00:13:47.490 --> 00:13:52.450
and all that. There is a particular type of

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.900
understanding

00:13:56.450 --> 00:14:00.530
of all these dead bodies,

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.860
how they behave, Where do they go?

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:06.650
And is I think a very big part

00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:10.990
of your knowledge, very big part.

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:15.490
So many diseases, incurable, you cannot cure,

00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.950
which are mostly coming from the left side.

00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.650
Medical science can cure the right side.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.400
I know that, that they can do it.

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:28.820
But cancer they will go on postponing from one to another,

00:14:29.070 --> 00:14:33.950
they'll operate, then it will spread, this and that.

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:38.990
Operation is not the way to cure, it's not.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:44.990
If you are expert  in Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to operate.

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.110
Overnight you can cure, overnight you can cure

00:14:49.360 --> 00:14:51.360
cancer patient, believe Me.

00:14:51.570 --> 00:14:55.360
You are quite capable of doing that. Especially Indians,

00:14:55.650 --> 00:14:59.110
because Indians have a special capacity.

00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:04.150
I should say what special blessing of this country.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:08.200
We don't know this country how great it is,

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:12.860
but we are only dealing with the western education,

00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:18.530
where have they reached, these western people in their experiments,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:20.690
I just don't understand.

00:15:20.900 --> 00:15:23.900
Their children are taking to drugs,

00:15:24.490 --> 00:15:27.200
their families are disturbed,

00:15:27.450 --> 00:15:30.030
everything is so upset.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.450
Not that I decry this education, not at all.

00:15:34.690 --> 00:15:37.690
But it is not complete

00:15:37.950 --> 00:15:40.950
and you should have the other side of it.

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:45.150
Otherwise, don't have a cancer altogether.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.740
Only have physical things

00:15:50.990 --> 00:15:53.610
by which you will work it out

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.860
but if you want to have

00:15:57.150 --> 00:16:00.200
patients of all types,

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:03.530
then you must know the other side.

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.240
There is nothing to be frightened, nothing to be upset,

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:12.030
but it's a knowledge which you should have as doctors,

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:16.950
because I think the medical science  is still not complete

00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:21.150
that as Doctor Aggarwal himself has said it.

00:16:21.400 --> 00:16:27.690
But what is lacking in it, the know- ledge of the left side that we have.

00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:31.650
Now if I should say that

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:34.530
I didn't read it in any book,

00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:36.780
I didn't get it from any book,

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:39.400
but only when I was

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:43.860
working with Sahaja Yoga, with people, I discovered

00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.530
that compared to India, western people

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:50.150
are much more affected by the left side, much more.

00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:55.740
much more. And they cannot understand

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:00.690
how they are sick, what has happened to them.

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:05.950
Even if you take a very limited area of treatment

00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:10.150
of a human welfare

00:17:10.570 --> 00:17:16.320
then is a very important part is the left side

00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:20.030
Supposing a lady who is all the time crying

00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:23.490
and weeping and unhappy,

00:17:23.740 --> 00:17:26.690
she can get cancer.

00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:32.110
Now there are two types,

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.740
one also right sided diseases,

00:17:35.030 --> 00:17:37.320
one is of course the left side.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:39.650
In the right sided people,

00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:44.070
who are extremely, I should say, aggressive,

00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.240
extremely overpowering, controlling type,

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:52.610
of course they have a very bad liver, I must say.

00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:55.690
They have a very bad liver

00:17:55.900 --> 00:18:02.070
and when they get like that they cross all the limits

00:18:02.530 --> 00:18:04.860
and when they cross all the limits

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:11.280
they get such diseases which you cannot find out, you cannot cure.

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:15.990
One of them is the disease of the liver,

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:20.690
I think doctors can't cure liver. They may try,

00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:25.990
but can't cure liver as Sahaja Yoga can cure.

00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:31.490
And such a person  whose temperament, he's so hot tempered

00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.280
and he's  so aggressive and this and that,

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:41.610
he suffers from that horrible liver

00:18:41.860 --> 00:18:46.110
and develops all kinds of complications.

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.570
There are so many other diseases also

00:18:50.740 --> 00:18:53.320
on the right side, so many other.

00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:57.610
But mainly I think is a disease of the liver.

00:18:57.780 --> 00:19:00.780
Liver is lived with.

00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:06.400
And if your liver is out, there is no solution in the allopathy.

00:19:06.610 --> 00:19:10.570
May be little bit here and little bit there.

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.400
But at the climax of it,

00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:20.360
with the liver one can faint, one can even die.

00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:27.820
In the West, liver problem is very common

00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:33.860
and there is no solution for them for that.

00:19:34.780 --> 00:19:36.610
They go on living with it

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:41.780
and doctors just admit them in the hospital.

00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:47.030
These are not incurable, they are absolutely curable.

00:19:47.280 --> 00:19:50.650
Because we haven't got that knowledge

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:57.570
and that's why we call them incurable. No, they're not.

00:19:58.450 --> 00:20:00.860
I do not want to blame other diseases,

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:06.690
but there are so many of them, which cannot be even diagnosed

00:20:06.900 --> 00:20:11.070
and which cannot be cured by the medical science.

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:14.490
Which we must accept first of all,

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.820
that that is the situation.

00:20:17.070 --> 00:20:21.320
We may go on trying doing anything

00:20:21.570 --> 00:20:23.450
but we cannot cure.

00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:27.820
So many types of medicines will come out, we cannot cure.

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:30.450
Because what I am trying to tell you

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:32.110
that's only half part

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:37.070
of your being is discussed.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:41.400
In that also so many things are not there.

00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.450
Take it for example asthma,

00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.110
asthma cannot be cured by doctors, is a fact

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:53.690
but Sahaja Yoga can absolutely cure

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.280
Allergies also can be cured by us.

00:20:57.530 --> 00:21:02.070
Because if you have the roots of all the troubles,

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.690
if you know about the roots,

00:21:04.900 --> 00:21:08.530
not pharmaceutical and all that but real roots,

00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:12.990
then you  can handle the situation and you can cure.

00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:18.360
We haven't got any yet a college or anything so far in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:22.950
I wish we could. But hospital we have.

00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:28.400
We have a hospital in Belapur, they call it

00:21:28.950 --> 00:21:33.320
New Bombay, where they are treating people.

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:36.280
Only they have to pay for their stay

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:40.490
and it's hardly I think 300 rupees per day

00:21:40.690 --> 00:21:46.700
for poor people. But you don't need any medicine,

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.650
you don't have to pay for anything.

00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:52.690
For our country which is so poor,

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:55.490
don't you think, it's very important?

00:21:55.740 --> 00:21:59.070
Otherwise you go for X-ray,

00:21:59.320 --> 00:22:02.690
then you go for another test,

00:22:02.900 --> 00:22:07.900
then for another test and nothing comes out of it.

00:22:09.690 --> 00:22:14.990
One should only know how to deal with it.

00:22:16.700 --> 00:22:21.200
Now supposing somebody's leg is broken - finished,

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:26.900
cut his leg, put another leg. No need,

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:30.650
I assure you there is no need.

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.240
Now we have some doctors in Sahaja Yoga, very good.

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.030
Some of them are in America, some of them are in Italy

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:43.530
and some of them are in Russia.

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:45.690
Russian doctors are very good.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.240
I don't know how they think

00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.650
that there is something beyond this education

00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.530
and they are trying to learn it.

00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.530
If you can make any facility,

00:22:57.740 --> 00:22:59.950
I will be very happy but in any case

00:23:00.150 --> 00:23:02.150
I am thinking of starting

00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:06.610
a Sahaja Yoga hospital in your country

00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:09.280
specially in Delhi,

00:23:09.610 --> 00:23:12.150
in Greater Noida

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.610
and if some of your doctors can join us

00:23:18.820 --> 00:23:21.320
help us a lot.

00:23:21.740 --> 00:23:25.950
In Greater Noida I am thinking of starting

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:29.360
a college or we can call it a school

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:33.780
we'll get the students as well as doctors

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:38.690
who can cure people. And there will be...

00:23:40.150 --> 00:23:42.490
And there will be no charges for treatment.

00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.200
Of course, where they stay, if they come and stay there

00:23:46.450 --> 00:23:49.570
then they might have to pay for  their food, that's all.

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.650
Otherwise this is an arrangement I am having

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:57.570
and anybody who wants to join as a doctor, also

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:01.530
we'll like to accept their services.

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:05.820
How much will be the pay I don't now, but not much I would say,

00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:10.690
we'll pay about 6000 to 7000 per month to a doctor.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:12.780
But he has to be a Sahaja yogi

00:24:13.030 --> 00:24:16.400
and he should know the method of Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:19.700
I think, it is one of

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:23.860
the very generous feeling

00:24:24.150 --> 00:24:27.570
that in our country so many die

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:32.200
because they cannot get into the hospital, they cannot get treated.

00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:39.360
If you can give some time to this project of Mine,

00:24:39.610 --> 00:24:45.320
I am sure I'll be able to organize a good hospital

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:48.860
for those people. In that we'll have

00:24:49.110 --> 00:24:52.820
somatic patients as well as psychosomatic patients

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.610
all kinds of patients we'll have.

00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:58.530
And you will learn so much

00:24:58.700 --> 00:25:02.950
because it's a very subtle and deep knowledge.

00:25:03.150 --> 00:25:08.690
Just cannot learn it on the book, you have to have experiment

00:25:08.860 --> 00:25:12.070
with the patient. You will be amazed,

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.490
how you will be curing people.

00:25:14.690 --> 00:25:19.320
It´s not book of knowledge, it's a very, very practical knowledge

00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:25.610
and those who have that charitable temperament

00:25:25.820 --> 00:25:28.950
can do very well and learn a lot.

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:31.690
One thing I must tell you

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.400
Sahaja Yoga has one bad point also,

00:25:35.650 --> 00:25:39.950
that you cannot make money, you cannot.

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.990
If you try making money out of it, you fail.

00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:48.780
Some or other this money business is little higher

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:52.530
for Sahaja Yogis, they cannot manage with it.

00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:55.900
But you can give service.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:03.400
Now we had a very nice retired doctor in this Belapur hospital

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.860
and he did very well,

00:26:06.070 --> 00:26:09.070
now he is no more. He worked very hard

00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:13.070
but his daughter in law is now looking after that.

00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:17.570
If you want, if you are retired people,

00:26:17.780 --> 00:26:20.070
if you are not in need of money

00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:24.570
much money then it's a very good thing.

00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:30.900
Also we provide, say, a residence,

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:36.070
food, everything, can be managed, it's not so difficult,

00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:40.150
but it's not a very money oriented

00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:44.150
I must say since I was studying medical,

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:49.320
now medical line has become very money oriented,

00:26:49.530 --> 00:26:51.950
I am surprised. I am sorry to say,

00:26:52.150 --> 00:26:54.280
but they have become very money oriented

00:26:54.450 --> 00:26:56.990
and some of your doctors have gone to America

00:26:57.200 --> 00:26:59.860
and have befooled people so much

00:27:00.070 --> 00:27:04.400
and have made so much money that you feel ashamed to be an Indian,

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:05.450
it's like that.

00:27:05.650 --> 00:27:07.280
You can't make much money

00:27:07.490 --> 00:27:11.780
but as retired people you can join us and help us

00:27:12.030 --> 00:27:15.030
and some of you can come to learn Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:19.150
Hardly within say months time you will be experts.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:23.530
You can diagnose the thing without any delay.

00:27:23.740 --> 00:27:26.900
You don't have to go to any laboratory or anything,

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:30.240
immediately you will know what's the trouble.

00:27:30.490 --> 00:27:34.900
And all sorts of incurable diseases you can try.

00:27:35.150 --> 00:27:41.070
I am amazed Myself as to how it is working with people.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:44.740
Now all these awards and all that they have given Me

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:47.860
because I have cured people and done that

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:50.610
but I don't have a hospital there.

00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:55.740
First hospital I want to have in Delhi and here I want to work it out.

00:27:55.950 --> 00:28:00.610
Let us think of working it out ourselves.

00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:06.320
It's a charitable hospital and it's very sensible,

00:28:06.490 --> 00:28:09.320
I have already got money to build,

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:14.280
but only thing I need some doctors who can help Me,

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:16.570
it´s a very stunning thing Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:19.530
if you come you will be amazed how it works.

00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:21.110
I know

00:28:21.450 --> 00:28:24.900
never been that, we have never been connected to the divine.

00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:27.990
We have never used that forces of the divine

00:28:28.240 --> 00:28:33.860
and once you start using those forces you will be amazed at yourself.

00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:38.650
It is said that you should find out who you are,

00:28:39.950 --> 00:28:45.240
that's not possible unless and until you have your selfrealization.

00:28:45.490 --> 00:28:48.990
Today in our country we need self realized people

00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:52.650
all kinds of problems can be solved.

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:55.690
Every type of,

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:59.530
I should say, quarrelling is going on.

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:03.360
Because you become a collective person,

00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:09.110
you become a personality of a collective nature,

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.780
no more fighting no more is needed. I have many

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:15.360
Muslim countries who have got realization,

00:29:15.610 --> 00:29:22.320
Turkey, this Benin, there is another one called as Ivory Coast.

00:29:22.530 --> 00:29:25.240
There are seven countries that side,

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.070
they are all Muslims converted,

00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.950
or rather transformed into Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:36.110
In this all the integration of all the religions take place,

00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:39.280
understanding of the

00:29:39.490 --> 00:29:43.860
human abilities,

00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:47.690
human personality and respect.

00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:52.400
I mean it's a very different atmosphere into which you get,

00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:57.200
it's a very different level of awareness, as you were saying,

00:29:57.450 --> 00:30:02.490
where you become so peaceful, silent,

00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:06.110
yet so sweet.

00:30:06.690 --> 00:30:08.400
So I don't know in this short lecture

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:10.820
how much can I tell you about Sahaja Yoga

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:14.360
bur it is a very miraculous thing.

00:30:14.570 --> 00:30:17.950
And please try to get your self realization,

00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:22.780
he has Me, I think, I will try if I can do that.

00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:31.400
There is one small thing; you have to take out your shoes.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:38.240
In England first time I asked them to take out your shoes they walked off.

00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:42.240
English cannot live without their shoes, I think.

00:30:44.030 --> 00:30:46.610
Please take out your shoes.

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:55.200
Those who don't want to have can leave. There's no force on anyone.

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:03.570
First of all, have faith in yourself

00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:10.280
that you can get self realization.

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:16.690
Please put both the feet on the ground.

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.780
Can you put both the hands towards Me like this?

00:31:44.570 --> 00:31:48.030
And now please close your eyes, please.

00:31:56.240 --> 00:31:59.030
You know a lot about Kundalini,

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:03.320
but now you will find, out what She is.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:49.450
Please put right hand on top of your fontanel bone area,

00:32:50.490 --> 00:32:54.490
which was a soft bone in your childhood, please.

00:32:59.860 --> 00:33:03.240
Not touching the head, away from the head.

00:33:05.740 --> 00:33:09.280
Now, please put your left hand

00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.740
on top of your head;

00:33:30.860 --> 00:33:33.450
again the right hand.

00:34:03.740 --> 00:34:09.860
Now see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area,

00:34:10.110 --> 00:34:12.490
could be hot also.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:19.650
Just see if there is cool breeze,

00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:28.610
it could be hot as I told you, doesn't matter.

00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:45.900
Now try with the left hand and right hand towards Me.

00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:51.240
If there is a cool breeze coming out of...please put down your head.

00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:11.200
Haan (MEANS Yes)

00:35:15.450 --> 00:35:21.320
There are some left sided people I must tell you, there are some,

00:35:22.240 --> 00:35:27.400
but you will find out very soon. Now please open your eyes.

00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:33.150
Again put both the hands towards Me, please, like this.

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:05.450
Now in your hands you will feel the cool breeze

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:09.570
or may be the hot.

00:36:31.070 --> 00:36:32.820
Both the hands.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:37.900
Saare doctor ho gaye paar. (All Doctors have achieved their self-realization).

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:40.280
They are Saints or what!

00:36:40.490 --> 00:36:45.450
So many have got realization. May God bless you.

00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.950
May God bless you.

00:36:53.070 --> 00:36:56.360
We have some books, I hope, of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:59.950
You all can take it and see for yourself

00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:06.150
and master this art. It's very good and very simple

00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:10.780
and very much necessary in modern times.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:15.900
As I told you for diagnosis, you  don't have to do anything.

00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:18.450
You just will know on your fingertips

00:37:18.650 --> 00:37:21.150
what chakras are catching.

00:37:21.690 --> 00:37:24.150
Also you'll know how to cure them.

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.320
Very simple it is, very simple.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.950
May God bless you!
