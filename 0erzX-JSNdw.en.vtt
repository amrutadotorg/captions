00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.980
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.720
One has to realize that Truth is what it is.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.020
You cannot conceptualize it.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.740
You cannot organize it.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.980
And you cannot maneuver it.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.520
It is self-supporting.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.700
Now before you I have to put the theory, you can call it,

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.160
or a hypothesis about what is within ourselves.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.520
In a subtle form, what we have inside and outside.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.680
We see everything - like these flowers,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.180
all that is living - and we take it for granted.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.940
But who does this miraculous work, this living work?

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.220
Now you have to have an open mind of a scientist

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.520
to see if this hypothesis is working or not.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.320
And if it works, then you have to accept it in your honesty.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:00.060
There is an all-pervading power, a subtle power, all over,

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.700
that does all these miraculous living things.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.080
We have come from ameba to human stage.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.500
From ameba to human stage we have come.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.940
But still we have not reached the absolute Truth.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.280
We live in a relative world.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:02.080
So there are difference of opinions and difference of believes.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.540
But there is within us a power,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.560
which can connect us to this all-pervading power.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.600
And this union is a real yoga.

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.220
Otherwise, all kinds of yogas are there, but they are unjust

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.920
or physical or maybe little mental projections.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.620
Now as everything is living work,

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:05.380
our evolution is also a living work.

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.100
And at a human level now, with our human awareness,

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.300
there is a little breakthrough needed.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.040
This breakthrough will give us

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:45.120
a new awareness, a new dimension.

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:57.080
This power, which is within us, is called as Kundalini

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.240
in Sanskrit language.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:11.840
Now in the West you have the knowledge of the trivial.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:22.000
But this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:28.800
And if you do not have the knowledge of the roots,

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.160
we can destroy ourselves completely.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.100
So this knowledge has to be understood.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:55.080
This power rests in a triangular bone called as Sacrum.

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.620
Sacrum means "sacred". That means Greeks knew

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:12.020
that there is a sacred power inside this triangular bone.

00:07:22.660 --> 00:07:27.540
So this power has to rise within us

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.800
and has to break through our fontanel bone area,

00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:35.560
which was a soft bone in our childhood.

00:07:48.420 --> 00:07:52.580
Like this instrument, if it is not connected to the means,

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:56.440
it is of no use, it has no meaning.

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:09.260
In the same way, unless and until we are connected to the means,

00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:13.620
we too do not know the meaning of our life.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:32.520
When this power rises, just like a seed is sprouting,

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.700
it is your mother power.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.920
It is the power of pure desire.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.940
All other desires are in general not satiable.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:05.080
Not satiable. Not generally satiable.

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.580
Because you want to have today supposing you want to have food,

00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.760
tomorrow you want to have a house, the day after tomorrow a car,

00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:20.840
I don't know, then a helicopter, still you are not satisfied.

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.540
And ultimately, I found, where there is too much money,

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:37.840
then they commit suicide.

00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:53.320
So there must be something, which is a pure desire within us.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:03.780
We may not be aware of that power,

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:07.280
but it exist within us.

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:18.400
And that desire is to be one with this all-pervading power.

00:10:18.600 --> 00:10:21.660
It's subtle power.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.320
What human beings can do is, that if there is a dead tree,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.520
we can make a furniture. From death to death.

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.840
But we cannot create even the wood ourselves.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.280
[Sahaja yogi: Sorry Mother, we cannot...?]

00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.500
We cannot even create the wood ourselves.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.580
[Sahaja yogi: The wood?]
Wood, I mean the tree or anything ourselves,

00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:00.880
not even the clay.

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:09.580
But we feel we are great, because we've done

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:13.240
some atom bombs and nitrogen bombs.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:21.260
That's only for our destruction.

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:26.880
So we go into imbalances. Anything we want to have,

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.020
we go into imbalances.

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:39.500
Like, they wanted to have science; with science, it's atom bomb.

00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:47.380
Now they are having ecological problems, this problem,

00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.460
problems, problems, problems.

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:56.180
The problems have increased much more

00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.260
than they were about hundred years back.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.000
Now we have machines and then we want to have run the machines

00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.380
and we run machines to such extend that we don't know what to do

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.980
with them. Because you have to go on producing!

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.180
Now in America, they have produced so much of plastic,

00:12:26.360 --> 00:12:29.600
they don't know what to do with it.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:44.420
So machines are for us, we are not for the machines.

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:52.060
So we have lost ourselves somewhere.

00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:58.000
Because we haven't got the Truth with us.

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:04.000
And it is very easy

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.560
to get Self-realization.

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.680
To get Self-knowledge.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:19.860
Because it's a living process. It is so vital.

00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.880
It works so spontaneously.

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.100
And all of you can become

00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.600
those super human beings, who know the Absolute.

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:50.960
When you are connected with the Divine power,

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:56.460
it starts flowing through you like cool breeze, from your hands.

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:08.440
And you feel the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:11.700
Yourself you feel it.

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:23.020
It is a fantastic thing that is a human being.

00:14:26.780 --> 00:14:31.960
You are at the epitome of evolution. Epitome of evolution!

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:53.620
Only you are still to be connected to the means.

00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:06.060
The first thing that happens to you, when this Kundalini rises

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:11.320
within you, that you get back your innocence.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:27.040
You get your purity of your innocence.

00:15:31.380 --> 00:15:38.300
Then, second thing that's so easy to happen is that

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:41.880
suddenly you become very creative.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.140
It is very surprising, I have seen,

00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:58.080
people who could not even sing have become great musicians.

00:16:04.100 --> 00:16:08.780
There are very great artists, who have come out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:17.300
Also your brain opens out and you become extremely dynamic.

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:28.140
At the same time, you are very compassionate.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.660
And you are completely at peace with yourself.

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:50.280
As a result of this happening, the first thing that happens to you

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:57.060
really, is that you get cure of your elements, physical.

00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:08.760
And you know how to cure yourself and cure others.

00:17:13.620 --> 00:17:16.580
In a medical terminology we can see that

00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:20.940
we become in charge of the parasympathetic nervous system.

00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:40.820
And all so-called incurable diseases are being cured.

00:17:46.020 --> 00:17:49.620
We have got some doctors in India, who have got MD on Sahaja Yoga

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.440
[Doctor of Medicine, ed.] for curing diseases.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.240
Mentally you become so strong that

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:11.500
all your bad habits drop out automatically.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.600
Supposing you are holding onto a snake

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:26.860
and somebody says, "You have a snake in your hand."

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:30.480
But in darkness you say, "No, I think it's a rope."

00:18:30.660 --> 00:18:33.200
[Shri Mataji repeating for the translator:] It's a rope.

00:18:33.380 --> 00:18:36.360
In the darkness, you see, if you are holding a snake.

00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:39.580
Snake. And somebody says it's a...

00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:48.380
But if the light comes in, he drops the snake.

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:51.520
All right. And snakes run away.

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:12.160
So, whatever we agree in our ignorance,

00:19:12.340 --> 00:19:15.600
just runs away from us

00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:19.340
and we become really free people.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.620
Many people, who has schizophrenia, say, also lunatics,

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.840
have been cured with Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:47.300
And also the absurd habits people have developed

00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:51.620
in their own ego, they get all right.

00:20:00.040 --> 00:20:03.220
I have seen many children, many students,

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:06.940
who could'n get through in their exams, have got

00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.200
first class and are doing very well in India.

00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:28.920
Emotionally you become so balanced,

00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:35.620
that you have very happy married life.

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:42.720
And you have beautiful children.

00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:53.120
All these things happen because of your transformation.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.220
Because the Spirit, which is in your heart,

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.140
comes into your attention now.

00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:16.500
And then your attention becomes very powerful.

00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:23.280
When you pay your attention to someone, you immediately know,

00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:26.880
what's wrong with that person.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.680
And once you are established fully, properly,

00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:47.120
then even a glance can do the work.

00:21:55.260 --> 00:21:59.540
But, highest of all, you become

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:03.620
extremely peaceful and very joyous.

00:22:09.100 --> 00:22:11.800
You enjoy the comfort of the Spirit, you don't bother about

00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:14.980
other comforts.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:30.980
All this looks very fantastic, again, I would say.

00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:38.360
But say for a television, if you take it to a remote village

00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.980
in India to who have never seen it, and if you tell them that,

00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:46.520
"In this box you can see everything from different places,"

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:50.300
they'll say, "No, how can it be? It's just a box."

00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.860
But once you put to the mains, you see the dynamism

00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:09.380
and the beauty of that television.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:22.360
That is how we are.

00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:29.280
We are great,

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.820
we are glorious.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.740
But we have to be connected with the mains.

00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:51.740
That is our right, as human beings, to have it.

00:23:58.300 --> 00:24:01.300
I would, of course, like you to ask me few questions,

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.220
but there are so many people.

00:24:05.600 --> 00:24:10.000
You can ask me some questions and if you have some more,

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:13.140
you can write them down, I'll answer them tomorrow.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.120
But there should not be any aggression, because I have not come here

00:24:16.300 --> 00:24:19.760
to take anything from you.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:40.120
These are your own powers.

00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.440
And you will be endowed with powers to give others Realization.

00:24:48.620 --> 00:24:50.420
To...

00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.300
So I would request you to ask me questions, few questions,

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.440
and then if you want, we can have the session of meditation,

00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:10.260
in which you can feel your all-pervading power.

00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:28.060
But should be questions,

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:31.580
which are related to the subject.

00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.740
[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, there is a question. Is there any effect of:

00:25:56.920 --> 00:26:01.520
If you feel the diseased person and you take the disease on you

00:26:01.700 --> 00:26:05.320
and then you, being the healthy man,

00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:10.000
can you transfer this health onto him?]

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:21.140
Now, you don't take any diseases.
[Sahaja yogi: Sorry?]

00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:24.140
You don't take any diseases. You are an instrument,

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:27.340
you just note it down.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:12.080
[Shri Mataji is speaking about Her drink:]

00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:15.960
This s very sour, she is not understanding.

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:21.120
First get [UNCLEAR] water. This is too sour.

00:27:22.540 --> 00:27:25.620
This is very sour for the throat.

00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:28.280
[Sahaja yogi: So shall we continue? Or shall I translate the question,

00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:31.780
the another question?]
Read it, the question.

00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:50.680
[Sahaja yogi: Mother, second question is: How to get rid of insomnia,

00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:54.420
lack of sleep? And the other question is: How to get the energy,

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:59.020
if you do not have the sufficient quantity of it for you?]

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.740
I'll answer the second first.

00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:09.100
That, you don't have to decide.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:15.620
Your Kundalini knows everything, she is like a tape recorder,

00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:20.040
she knows you very well, she is your individual Mother.

00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:29.340
What is the first question was?

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.540
[Sahaja yogi: There was a question of: How to get rid of insomnia?

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.740
And the second question was: If you don't have the sufficient

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.080
quantity of energy, where to get?]
That I have said. So,

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:42.880
the first question was "insomnia". Is curable by Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:43.060 --> 00:28:47.000
Now, we'll be having a center here in Leningrad,

00:28:47.180 --> 00:28:51.740
where you will come and we'll solve the problem for you.

00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:04.800
But in any case - maybe today - you might get your Realization

00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:07.300
maybe.

00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:14.800
You may get rid of your problems.

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:32.880
Now, will you please write it down? It's better, systematic.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:06.940
What is the gentleman saying?

00:30:45.940 --> 00:30:50.140
Yes. Please. You have to be kind and civil.

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:58.000
I am not here to get anything.

00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:28.940
[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, there is a question:

00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.520
If Kali shakti is the same as Kundalini.

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:34.780
The question is: If Kali shakti, Mahakali shakti

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.980
is the same as Kundalini shakti, and can I address this...]

00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:41.080
No. I'll tell you tomorrow all about the chakras and the shaktis.

00:31:41.260 --> 00:31:44.940
All right? Tomorrow, in a complete lecture.

00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.020
I'll tell you everything.

00:32:01.700 --> 00:32:04.740
But this knowledge is Love.

00:32:11.140 --> 00:32:15.220
And even if you know everything about it by your brain, mentally,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.580
is not going to work out.

00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:24.320
It has to work out, is the point.

00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:32.460
The problem is the actualization.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:41.920
So by arguments and all these things

00:32:42.100 --> 00:32:46.720
you are in the web of words.

00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:08.480
[Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, the question is: Who is your teacher?]

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:11.940
I am myself my own teacher.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.960
And I'll make you your own teacher too.

00:33:26.060 --> 00:33:30.400
Once you have your Spirit, once have your enlightenment,

00:33:30.580 --> 00:33:33.680
you don't need a teacher at all.

00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:47.320
And you have to know that this is a living process,

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:50.240
and anybody who takes money from you

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:53.560
is a false master.

00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:09.220
And you cannot pay for it.

00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.040
Or it is also not outside, like you go on chanting

00:34:14.220 --> 00:34:17.300
or saying something.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:23.800
It's a happening within.

00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.380
[Sahaja yogi: Mataji, there is a question.

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:14.040
The question is: Our attitude towards

00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:17.720
Sri Aurobindo and his teaching.]

00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:22.100
Now... You see, teachings are teachings, has no meaning to me.

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:25.240
They must act.

00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:33.140
All mental.

00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.400
[Sahaja yogi: Mataji, there is few questions.]

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:53.820
We'll answer you tomorrow, don't you worry.

00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:00.520
All right?

00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:06.680
Is all mental activity again.

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:14.520
But I wanted you to ask me questions to know

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:21.100
that your mind should not suddenly start

00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:24.760
bothering you too much.

00:36:35.540 --> 00:36:39.940
Because this mind is like a monkey, you know.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:55.960
It just makes you dance all the time.

00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.640
It's a joyless pursuit.

00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.820
Tomorrow I'll explain to you all these chakras

00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000
and all the left and right side,

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.520
sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic.

00:37:30.780 --> 00:37:36.180
And everything that you want to know about it.

00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.000
Now, see, there are so many lights here.

00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:58.340
And you have to, if put them on,

00:37:58.520 --> 00:38:02.440
you have to just switch on one switch.

00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:11.500
But supposing I have to give you a lecture about the

00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:14.680
electricity, how it was discovered and brought

00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:17.720
here to Leningrad and what is the source and all.

00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:21.200
It will be just a headache to you.

00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.200
Better to have the light!

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.200
Because it is already built-in.

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:43.760
In the same way it's all built-in within you.

00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:49.280
So why not have your own powers?

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.640
As simple as that.

00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:01.120
All right?

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:10.340
[Aside:] You could get somebody to stand here to show.

00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:13.400
You can get somebody to show that how to do it. To raise

00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:16.860
the Kundalini, all right? If you can get somebody, as to show.

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:20.080
Just one of the Sahaja yogis.

00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:26.140
Someone. Some man.

00:39:29.340 --> 00:39:32.860
All right. Anyone up. You can come.

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:37.640
Now, you can show.

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:41.240
Is here.

00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:46.340
Now, one simple thing we have to know.

00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:50.340
That

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.700
there are two conditions

00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:59.780
for your Realization.

00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:10.580
First condition is that you have to forget the past

00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:15.640
and you are not to feel guilty for anything.

00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:33.580
Because after all, we are human beings and if you make mistakes,

00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:37.660
there is nothing to feel guilty.

00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:48.480
And this all-pervading power, which I am talking about,

00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.800
is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:05.580
Now, whatever

00:41:07.560 --> 00:41:10.840
you think you have done wrong

00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:15.760
can be easily dissolved by this powerful ocean.

00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:29.560
So first you have to forgive yourself

00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:33.320
and forget your past completely.

00:41:43.660 --> 00:41:48.100
The past is finished and the future doesn't exist,

00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.660
so present is reality.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:05.080
Now the second condition is that

00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.560
you have to forgive everyone.

00:42:15.420 --> 00:42:19.740
Some of you may think that it's difficult to forgive.

00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.200
But it is just a mental activity.

00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:36.980
If you forgive or you don't forgive, what do you do?

00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.940
You just play into wrong hands.

00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:52.600
So you have to forgive.

00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:57.800
Forgive everyone. Forget the wars.

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:01.980
Forgive the Germans.

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:11.360
Because they are dead and gone now. Finished.

00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:19.080
[Repeating for the translator:] Germans are... they are dead.

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:30.420
Now, if you meet the new Germans who are Sahaja yogis,

00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:36.140
they are so gentle, so kind, so beautiful.

00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:03.980
And I asked them, "How is it that the British are still very arrogant

00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:08.020
and you people are so gentle?"

00:44:22.360 --> 00:44:25.660
And they said that their forefathers never lost any war

00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:30.240
and God we lost the war, so we are in our senses.

00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.660
Look at the wisdom now.

00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:48.400
So forget the past and forgive everyone.

00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:53.420
That's all you have to do.

00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.460
It's very important. Otherwise I cannot give you Realization.

00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:02.600
I am sorry.

00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:07.440
From your heart, please, do it.

00:45:09.140 --> 00:45:12.020
All right. Now we have to take out your shoes,

00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.680
because you have to take the help of the Mother Earth.

00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.860
[To a Sahaja yogi:] Floran, Floran, you get all the [UNCLEAR].

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:55.560
So now we have to know,

00:45:55.780 --> 00:46:00.580
that we have to be very pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

00:46:09.960 --> 00:46:12.440
To be...

00:46:12.660 --> 00:46:17.320
actually to love yourself and to respect.

00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:27.960
Only after Realization you will know how great you are,

00:46:28.140 --> 00:46:32.960
and how great are other people who have got Realization.

00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:43.760
The most beautiful things in this world to be enjoyed,

00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:47.780
more than flowers, are human beings.

00:46:58.220 --> 00:47:01.580
So now we have

00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:06.560
a simple nourishment

00:47:06.920 --> 00:47:12.260
of our centers, which I will show you before,

00:47:12.460 --> 00:47:15.480
and then you can close your eyes.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.540
Later on.

00:47:25.800 --> 00:47:30.060
It takes about ten to fifteen minutes. That's all.

00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:42.220
Now, you have to put both your feet apart from each other,

00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:46.780
because these are two powers, left and right.

00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.240
You have to be comfortably seated, not

00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.300
too much slouching or too much straight like that, but

00:47:58.480 --> 00:48:01.820
in a comfortable state of body.

00:48:11.940 --> 00:48:14.980
In a very pleasant mood.

00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:24.500
Now, you have to put your left hand towards me, like this.

00:48:30.120 --> 00:48:33.180
Very comfortably.

00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:38.780
And this symbolizes

00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:43.840
your desire to have Self-realization.

00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:54.860
Now, I cannot force it on you.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:02.320
You have to ask for it.

00:49:03.220 --> 00:49:06.520
I respect your freedom, because

00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:10.060
ultimately you have to get the complete freedom.

00:49:10.260 --> 00:49:13.680
So I cannot force on you.

00:49:23.640 --> 00:49:26.780
Now, the right hand is to be used for nourishing

00:49:26.980 --> 00:49:30.260
your centers on the left-hand side.

00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:41.580
So first we put our right hand on our heart.

00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:51.720
If you have anything in the pocket, please take out.

00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:54.980
Will be better, it is good for you.

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.160
Those, who don't want to do it, should go away.

00:50:00.340 --> 00:50:03.640
Should not disturb others by...

00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:12.280
Everyone of you have to do it.

00:50:12.480 --> 00:50:16.780
Otherwise you can leave the hall. If you don't want to do it,

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:20.100
I cannot force on you.

00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:36.660
And it will not be civil to watch others.

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.560
[For the translator:] It's not civil.

00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:46.440
So now, put left hand towards me

00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.640
and right hand on your heart, please.

00:50:59.300 --> 00:51:04.540
Now, in the heart resides the Spirit.

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:15.420
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:51:16.680 --> 00:51:21.260
And if you are the Spirit, you become your master.

00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:33.500
So now you put your hand on the left-hand side of your abdomen,

00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:36.740
in the upper part.

00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.560
This is the center of your mastery.

00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:54.600
Now you have to put your hand on the lower part of your abdomen,

00:51:54.800 --> 00:51:59.040
on the left-hand side. And press it hard.

00:52:07.180 --> 00:52:13.060
Now, this is the center of your...

00:52:13.260 --> 00:52:16.480
the knowledge of the purity,

00:52:16.640 --> 00:52:20.560
or you can say the pure knowledge.

00:52:24.020 --> 00:52:27.940
Which manifests on your fingertips.

00:52:30.660 --> 00:52:34.740
As if you become a spiritual computer.

00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:41.740
Now, raise your hand again on the upper portion

00:52:41.920 --> 00:52:45.560
of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

00:52:52.860 --> 00:52:56.640
Then raise it again to your heart.

00:52:58.180 --> 00:53:02.100
Then raise it in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

00:53:02.300 --> 00:53:07.820
as far as possible, and turn your head to your right.

00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:24.060
Put it here, nicely.

00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:30.740
Now, this center catches, when we are guilty.

00:53:37.540 --> 00:53:42.040
As a result of that, you get diseases, very dangerous diseases like

00:53:42.220 --> 00:53:45.640
angina, spondylitis.

00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:59.380
Now, you put your right hand on top of your forehead across,

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:02.580
and put down your head.

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.780
And press it on both the sides.

00:54:15.740 --> 00:54:19.520
This is the center for forgiveness.

00:54:22.440 --> 00:54:26.320
Now, you have to take back your hand on the back side of your head.

00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:29.560
Back side of your head. And push back your head

00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:32.940
as far as possible backward.

00:54:40.360 --> 00:54:43.660
This is the center for asking forgiveness

00:54:43.840 --> 00:54:47.620
of this all-pervading power.

00:54:53.820 --> 00:54:59.020
But you are not to feel guilty, or to count your mistakes.

00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:09.960
Now, you have to stretch your hand fully like this,

00:55:10.160 --> 00:55:15.220
and put the center of your palm on top of your fontanel bone area,

00:55:15.400 --> 00:55:18.540
where it was soft bone.

00:55:27.660 --> 00:55:31.100
Now, you have to press it hard.

00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:35.800
And move it, seven times your scalp, slowly.

00:55:35.980 --> 00:55:39.520
You can push back your fingers.

00:55:45.500 --> 00:55:50.420
Put down your head and push back your fingers.

00:56:00.660 --> 00:56:03.120
Seven times.

00:56:03.300 --> 00:56:06.380
That's what we have to do.

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.480
You have to press it hard.

00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:14.080
With the fingers outward.

00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:20.060
Now, you will have to close your eyes.

00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:28.680
You can take out your spectacles. Until I tell you, please,

00:56:31.480 --> 00:56:34.480
don't open your eyes.

00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:42.300
Put your both the hands, feet, on the sides

00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:48.000
and one hand towards me like this, and close your eyes.

00:56:58.940 --> 00:57:03.360
Now, take the right hand on your heart.

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:11.080
Now, here you ask a question to me, three times,

00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:15.080
which is very important. In your heart.

00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:18.960
You can call me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like.

00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:22.120
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

00:57:22.300 --> 00:57:27.540
Ask this question three times, as you would ask a computer.

00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:54.040
Now, if you are the Spirit,

00:57:54.220 --> 00:58:00.120
you are your guide, your own master.

00:58:06.820 --> 00:58:10.680
So please, take your right hand to the upper portion of your abdomen

00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:14.860
and press it hard. On the left-hand side.

00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:34.360
So now, here you ask me another question three times.

00:58:37.260 --> 00:58:41.800
Mother, am I my own master?

00:59:07.740 --> 00:59:13.760
As I've told you, that I cannot force the pure knowledge on you.

00:59:18.860 --> 00:59:22.040
You have ask for it.

00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.460
So now, please, put your right hand in the

00:59:26.660 --> 00:59:31.040
lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

00:59:36.540 --> 00:59:42.000
Now, here you ask six times.

00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:47.980
"Mother, please, give me pure knowledge."

00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:52.620
Because this center has got six petals.

01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:16.840
As soon as you ask this question, this residual power

01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:20.240
of Kundalini starts rising.

01:00:27.020 --> 01:00:33.000
So you have to open the upper centers

01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:37.700
by your self-confidence.

01:00:42.580 --> 01:00:45.900
So now, raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:49.080
on the left-hand side.

01:00:56.620 --> 01:01:00.520
Here now, with full confidence

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:06.020
we have to say ten times:

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:11.540
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:27.300
Now, one has to know that you are not this body,

01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:32.620
you are not this mind, you are not this intellect.

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:46.660
You are not your conditioning or your ego

01:01:50.460 --> 01:01:53.480
nor your intellect.

01:01:54.720 --> 01:02:00.000
Because you say, "my emotions, my body."

01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:03.300
You don't say, "I body."

01:02:08.440 --> 01:02:13.300
So you are the pure Spirit.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:23.780
Now, raise our hand to your heart on the left-hand side

01:02:26.020 --> 01:02:29.620
and here again with full confidence,

01:02:30.900 --> 01:02:37.180
please, say twelve times: "Mother, I am the Spirit."

01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:53.240
Now, again I have to tell you

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:59.280
that this great all-pervading power

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:08.000
is the ocean of love and compassion.

01:03:09.460 --> 01:03:13.740
It is the ocean of bliss and joy.

01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:21.580
But above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:29.380
So please, know that

01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.600
whatever mistakes you have committed, can be easily dissolved

01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:40.980
by this great ocean of forgiveness.

01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:48.780
So now, raise your hand in the corner of your neck

01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.360
and your shoulder and turn your head to the right.

01:04:03.200 --> 01:04:06.100
Turn your head to the right.

01:04:06.300 --> 01:04:11.020
And you have to say with full confidence again

01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.660
sixteen times:

01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:19.020
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:04:23.680 --> 01:04:26.680
Sixteen times.

01:04:33.700 --> 01:04:36.860
I have already told you

01:04:39.220 --> 01:04:42.680
that it's a mental activity,

01:04:42.860 --> 01:04:46.540
when we say we cannot forgive someone.

01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:56.240
And whether we forgive, or we don't forgive, we don't do anything.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.040
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:12.400
Mentally, mentally you suffer.

01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:17.900
So now, just take your hand

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:21.840
on your forehead across and put down your head

01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:25.540
as much as your can on that hand.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:34.500
And press it, press it on both the sides.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:40.600
Press it on both the sides and here...

01:05:43.320 --> 01:05:46.340
and here you have to say:

01:05:47.220 --> 01:05:53.840
"Mother, I forgive all the people, everyone."

01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:03.300
Do not count whom you have to forgive.

01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:14.800
Now, take back your hand on the back side of your head

01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:20.000
and push back your head upward.

01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:34.060
Here you have to say, without counting your mistakes,

01:06:34.240 --> 01:06:37.400
without counting your guilt,

01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:40.900
just you have to say for your own satisfaction,

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:52.720
from your heart, not how many times,

01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.820
your have to say that, "Oh, all-pervading power,

01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:02.580
if I have done anything wrong, please forgive me."

01:07:17.880 --> 01:07:20.260
Now,

01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:24.160
stretch your hand

01:07:29.040 --> 01:07:32.540
and take your hand on top

01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.960
of the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone.

01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.820
Push back your fingers, put down your head.

01:07:47.640 --> 01:07:51.380
And - put down your head.

01:07:51.540 --> 01:07:57.420
Here again, I cannot cross over your freedom. You have to ask for...

01:08:02.140 --> 01:08:06.640
You have to ask for your Self-realization.

01:08:10.080 --> 01:08:16.080
So move your scalp so many times, slowly, saying:

01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:20.640
"Mother, please, give me Self-realization."

01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:17.660
Now, please, take down your both the hands

01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:20.820
and slowly open your eyes.

01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:30.700
Put both of your hands towards me like this.

01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:36.320
Watch me without thinking, you can do it now.

01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:50.380
Now, bend your head and see for yourself with your left hand,

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:53.060
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:56.700
There might be some hot, doesn't matter.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:24.160
Now, put your left hand towards me, put down your right hand

01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:27.280
and see for yourselves.

01:10:37.060 --> 01:10:41.500
Again once more, please, put down your head and see for yourself,

01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:45.280
if there is a cool breeze.

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:01.880
Now,

01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:07.220
you take both your hands up like that, push back your head.

01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.740
And ask me a question:

01:11:15.360 --> 01:11:20.920
"Is this the cool breeze of the all-pervading power of Love?"

01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.040
Please, ask this question three times.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:46.060
Now, take down your hands please.

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.140
All those, who have felt cool breeze

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:58.500
out of their heads or in their hands,

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:04.240
or even hot breeze coming out, please raise your both the hands.

01:12:13.240 --> 01:12:15.720
Both the hands. [My God!]

01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:18.620
Both the hands.

01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:24.060
The whole of Russia has got Realization!

01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:42.160
Now, just put your hands like this and ask the question:

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:49.600
"Mother, is Russia going to be the greatest spiritual country?"

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:58.100
It is true. It is true, I know that.

01:12:58.460 --> 01:13:01.220
And best - if it's true, the vibrations will increase,

01:13:01.400 --> 01:13:03.660
the cool breeze is here.

01:13:03.860 --> 01:13:07.000
Ask this question three times.

01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:23.540
All right?

01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:28.240
It's true.

01:13:30.060 --> 01:13:33.620
May all of you be blessed.

01:13:33.780 --> 01:13:39.460
And I'll come again tomorrow to explain to you.

01:13:43.900 --> 01:13:48.640
But now, now you should go in peace and silence

01:13:48.820 --> 01:13:51.140
and don't discuss it, don't think about it.

01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:54.340
Otherwise you'll loose it.

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:11.880
Those who haven't got it will get it tomorrow,

01:14:12.060 --> 01:14:17.380
and those who have got it, their connections will be fixed.

01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:28.140
Thank you very much.

01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:48.960
And now you all know yourself and enjoy!

01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.900
This is our religion: To know ourselves and to enjoy.
