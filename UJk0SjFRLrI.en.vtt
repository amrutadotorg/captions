00:08:04.825 --> 00:08:07.925
So today is a very happy and a

00:08:08.145 --> 00:08:12.145
very very auspicious day for all of us.

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:19.265
That we have to offer a just a thread

00:08:20.085 --> 00:08:25.025
to our brothers for their protection.

00:08:25.965 --> 00:08:31.245
I've already told you the story of Alexander the Great.

00:08:31.445 --> 00:08:35.185
How many of you have not heard it? Raise our hands.

00:08:35.425 --> 00:08:39.325
Look at that! Ha ha ha ha. Can't be! All right.

00:08:39.545 --> 00:08:42.265
So I'll tell you the story of Alexander.

00:08:42.465 --> 00:08:46.905
Ha ha ha. You're very clever, I know. Ha ha ha.

00:08:47.105 --> 00:08:48.445
All right.

00:08:48.645 --> 00:08:53.405
So the story of Alexander is like this.

00:08:53.605 --> 00:08:59.065
That Alexander the Great invaded India, you know,

00:08:59.265 --> 00:09:03.285
much before Buddha was born. Or we can say...

00:09:03.465 --> 00:09:07.225
No, we can say after Buddha was born.

00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:13.825
And he went with the idea of conquering the whole of India.

00:09:14.025 --> 00:09:16.945
He was very powerful man.

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:23.325
But God did not want that perhaps,

00:09:23.505 --> 00:09:26.985
so he was once defeated

00:09:27.185 --> 00:09:31.745
and one king called Puru arrested him.

00:09:31.965 --> 00:09:35.765
Alexander had married an Indian lady.

00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:40.185
And when he was under the arrest of this king,

00:09:40.365 --> 00:09:44.165
that was the day of this Raksha Bandhan. Same day.

00:09:44.485 --> 00:09:48.725
So, she was a clever lady,

00:09:48.905 --> 00:09:53.585
she put one thread like this in a small little plate

00:09:53.785 --> 00:09:58.005
and covered it nicely with some nice cloth

00:09:58.205 --> 00:10:02.445
and sent it to the king Puru in his court.

00:10:03.485 --> 00:10:06.625
When he took it to the court,

00:10:06.805 --> 00:10:10.425
somebody, and gave it to him,

00:10:10.605 --> 00:10:14.705
he had to wear it. Because that was the day of Raksha Bandhan.

00:10:14.905 --> 00:10:19.345
And that day anybody who sends you this thread is...

00:10:19.545 --> 00:10:21.585
you become the brother.

00:10:21.765 --> 00:10:25.565
So then he asked, "Who is my sister?"

00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:30.245
So they said, "She is the wife of Alexander."

00:10:30.445 --> 00:10:34.225
And he got really upset with him, because a sister's husband

00:10:34.425 --> 00:10:36.885
is something very great in India.

00:10:37.085 --> 00:10:44.625
So he rushed to the jail and fell straight on his knees

00:10:44.825 --> 00:10:47.885
and begged off his pardon. He said, "I am sorry sir,

00:10:48.085 --> 00:10:51.385
I didn't know you were the husband of my sister."

00:10:51.565 --> 00:10:54.345
He said, "What?"
[King Puru:] "Ya, you are.

00:10:54.525 --> 00:10:58.445
And I am sorry! I am very sorry for this thing,

00:10:58.645 --> 00:11:04.705
that I have jailed you this way and I put you here behind the bars.

00:11:04.905 --> 00:11:08.205
This was very wrong on my part."

00:11:08.405 --> 00:11:11.325
And he was so apologetic,

00:11:11.525 --> 00:11:14.325
that Alexander could not understand the whole thing.

00:11:14.525 --> 00:11:16.625
Not only that! He brought him back

00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:19.285
and put him on the throne, his own throne.

00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:22.345
And he said, "Now you rule here, I cannot say anything.

00:11:22.525 --> 00:11:24.965
Now you'll become the real king

00:11:25.145 --> 00:11:28.685
and I have to become sort of your subject."

00:11:28.885 --> 00:11:31.785
So Alexander started looking at him.

00:11:31.965 --> 00:11:34.725
He said, "I... I can't understand this."

00:11:34.905 --> 00:11:37.505
So then he went to his house.

00:11:37.685 --> 00:11:41.305
Then he went to his house with

00:11:45.785 --> 00:11:48.905
so many things that the king had given him.

00:11:49.105 --> 00:11:52.845
He gave jewelry, he gave saris, clothes for him

00:11:53.025 --> 00:11:57.345
and all kinds of things plus horses and elephants.

00:11:57.545 --> 00:12:01.805
And then, when he reached home, he found

00:12:01.985 --> 00:12:05.505
that his wife was smiling behind the doors.

00:12:05.705 --> 00:12:08.305
He said, "What's the matter?"
She said, "Don't you understand?"

00:12:08.485 --> 00:12:12.685
He said, "No, I don't understand, these Indians are funny people.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:16.665
I mean, I am such a dangerous man, he had put me in the jail

00:12:16.845 --> 00:12:20.045
and now he has released me. I just can't understand these Indians.

00:12:20.225 --> 00:12:26.365
How can this happen to a person who is so dangerous?"

00:12:26.765 --> 00:12:29.785
So, then she smiled and she said,

00:12:29.985 --> 00:12:32.285
"See, today is a day of Raksha Bandhan

00:12:32.485 --> 00:12:34.765
and this is the thread I sent him.

00:12:34.965 --> 00:12:38.305
And because this thread was tied to him, he became my brother

00:12:38.485 --> 00:12:41.705
and he had to release you.

00:12:41.905 --> 00:12:44.265
Because you are my brother." [Shri Mataji probably means "husband", ed.]

00:12:44.465 --> 00:12:49.105
He was so frightened. He said, "That settles it. I am going home!

00:12:49.285 --> 00:12:53.125
Because with this Indians who can leave a prisoner only on a thread,

00:12:53.325 --> 00:12:55.345
you can't manage these people, are very difficult."

00:12:55.525 --> 00:12:58.525
He could not understand.

00:12:59.485 --> 00:13:04.305
Somebody can translate it in Italian,

00:13:04.485 --> 00:13:07.965
because there are some Italian people here.

00:13:08.165 --> 00:13:11.665
You can do it later on. The story can be told to them

00:13:11.865 --> 00:13:14.345
in Italian language.

00:13:14.545 --> 00:13:17.565
So this is what it is. Is so important,

00:13:17.765 --> 00:13:22.525
that on this day if this is tied on your wrist,

00:13:22.725 --> 00:13:26.645
then you become brothers and sisters.

00:13:26.845 --> 00:13:32.265
Now, in Sahaja Yoga brotherhood is the most important.

00:13:33.365 --> 00:13:36.845
That is the friendliness among ourselves.

00:13:37.045 --> 00:13:39.745
When you are very good brothers and sisters,

00:13:39.945 --> 00:13:44.365
first of all, your left vishuddhi improves. This left vishuddhi.

00:13:44.565 --> 00:13:46.685
You get this left vishuddhi, because

00:13:46.885 --> 00:13:50.365
we don't have proper brother and sister relationship.

00:13:50.565 --> 00:13:53.505
Is not that we should have our own sister,

00:13:53.685 --> 00:13:58.705
but any woman who is a Sahaja Yogini is your sister.

00:13:58.885 --> 00:14:02.925
Except for your own wife. And this is the feeling.

00:14:03.105 --> 00:14:06.585
Unless and until we develop that pure feeling within ourselves,

00:14:06.765 --> 00:14:08.725
we cannot work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:08.905 --> 00:14:10.785
Sahaja Yoga cannot be worked out.

00:14:10.985 --> 00:14:15.585
I know it's rather difficult to digest, but is a fact.

00:14:15.785 --> 00:14:20.645
You have to feel clean and pure within your heart.

00:14:20.805 --> 00:14:23.585
Now see, we are so many Sahaja Yogis together,

00:14:23.765 --> 00:14:26.065
live in ashrams. We have no problems.

00:14:26.245 --> 00:14:28.645
But supposing, if you had these problems,

00:14:28.845 --> 00:14:30.525
this girl is running away with that boy,

00:14:30.705 --> 00:14:32.185
that boy is running with that girl,

00:14:32.365 --> 00:14:35.845
could not have known with whom she is living today.

00:14:36.025 --> 00:14:38.565
And those problems can only be solved,

00:14:38.745 --> 00:14:45.245
if you have the proper sense of a sister and a brother.

00:14:47.025 --> 00:14:51.505
And that is our dharma. That is our valence.

00:14:51.705 --> 00:14:55.585
That we should know that we have a brother,

00:14:55.745 --> 00:14:59.885
who is our Rakhi brother, and all others are also our brothers.

00:15:00.085 --> 00:15:05.785
A pure relationship must exist between brothers and sisters

00:15:05.985 --> 00:15:11.505
and of course you have your own wife, which is your private thing.

00:15:11.705 --> 00:15:14.525
There should be something like private in Sahaja Yoga

00:15:14.705 --> 00:15:17.805
and that is the only thing that is private for you,

00:15:18.005 --> 00:15:20.345
that you are husband and wife.

00:15:20.525 --> 00:15:22.725
The rest of it is all collective.

00:15:22.905 --> 00:15:26.725
And we have to live in a collective way among ourselves

00:15:26.905 --> 00:15:30.485
in very pure relationships.

00:15:30.685 --> 00:15:37.285
Now, as it is, we have to be in a collective way.

00:15:37.465 --> 00:15:43.765
At a slightest provocation people become non-collective.

00:15:43.945 --> 00:15:46.505
They cannot have rapport with other Sahaja Yogis,

00:15:46.705 --> 00:15:48.785
they cannot talk to other Sahaja Yogis,

00:15:48.985 --> 00:15:50.685
they cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis,

00:15:50.865 --> 00:15:53.685
then something wrong with them.

00:15:53.865 --> 00:15:56.025
They must understand something wrong with them

00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:57.985
and nothing wrong with others.

00:15:58.165 --> 00:16:01.105
I know of a Sahaja Yogi who came and told me, "Mother,

00:16:01.285 --> 00:16:04.725
they are very unkind to me, they are very suspicious of me,

00:16:04.925 --> 00:16:08.585
they do this and do that." Nothing of the kind! It was his own mind

00:16:08.765 --> 00:16:11.645
that was working like that and giving him ideas

00:16:11.845 --> 00:16:13.905
against other Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:14.085 --> 00:16:17.045
So never criticize your brothers and sisters.

00:16:17.245 --> 00:16:18.545
There is no need to criticize.

00:16:18.725 --> 00:16:21.325
If you have to criticize, criticize yourself.

00:16:21.485 --> 00:16:25.585
Best way is to criticize yourself and see for yourself,

00:16:25.785 --> 00:16:29.885
what's wrong with you that you cannot fit into the collective.

00:16:30.065 --> 00:16:32.785
As you know, it's a tremendous task

00:16:32.965 --> 00:16:35.665
and so important today, so vital,

00:16:35.865 --> 00:16:39.665
that we all should establish Sahaja Yoga properly.

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:44.105
Without Sahaja Yoga, do you see any, any other remedy,

00:16:44.305 --> 00:16:49.785
any other solution for today's chaos? We do not see any.

00:16:49.965 --> 00:16:54.745
Now, what do we have to do? I don't say you must

00:16:54.945 --> 00:16:58.285
bring Himalayas here, nor do I say

00:16:58.465 --> 00:17:01.605
that you must swim for seven miles together,

00:17:01.805 --> 00:17:06.645
nor do I say that you must take a plane

00:17:06.845 --> 00:17:09.705
which will take you round the world in one night.

00:17:09.905 --> 00:17:12.705
Nothing of the kind. These feats are not needed.

00:17:12.905 --> 00:17:16.605
A simple feat of rapport,

00:17:16.805 --> 00:17:20.965
of love being communicated to others.

00:17:21.165 --> 00:17:23.965
Just a simple thing it is, it's the simplest.

00:17:24.145 --> 00:17:28.145
You see the children; how they are so simple,

00:17:28.325 --> 00:17:32.965
how they are so natural, that they immediately feel the love

00:17:33.165 --> 00:17:36.545
and immediately react. But we cannot.

00:17:36.725 --> 00:17:40.405
The why... what is the reason? Why can't we react in that way?

00:17:40.585 --> 00:17:43.565
Why our attention is not on that point

00:17:43.765 --> 00:17:46.585
where we should react in such a manner

00:17:46.785 --> 00:17:51.585
that we should be absolutely congenial,

00:17:51.805 --> 00:17:55.205
enjoying each other's company.

00:17:55.425 --> 00:17:57.905
The reason is, our attention is outside.

00:17:58.085 --> 00:18:01.885
And the attention is outside in the West, as you have seen it,

00:18:02.085 --> 00:18:06.085
on something wrong, because there is no brother-and-sisterly feeling.

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:09.605
Supposing, a brother and sister are walking,

00:18:09.785 --> 00:18:12.865
they won't look at each other, will they?

00:18:14.105 --> 00:18:18.125
Will they be watching each other? No.

00:18:19.505 --> 00:18:24.465
But the attention that goes outside all the time towards

00:18:24.665 --> 00:18:29.605
all kinds of funny things, because there is no pure relationship.

00:18:29.805 --> 00:18:33.825
Purity helps you to understand the beauty of others.

00:18:34.025 --> 00:18:37.445
Otherwise there's a thought in between, always a thought.

00:18:37.645 --> 00:18:40.565
If it's a dirty thought, of course the purity is not there at all.

00:18:40.745 --> 00:18:45.745
But even other thoughts like possessiveness, of criticism,

00:18:45.925 --> 00:18:51.545
say, of repulsion, anything like that can kill the joy.

00:18:51.725 --> 00:18:55.665
So try to understand that there is something wrong with you,

00:18:55.865 --> 00:18:59.625
that's why you cannot get truly collective.

00:18:59.825 --> 00:19:05.845
We are one homogeneous big huge family.

00:19:06.145 --> 00:19:08.805
And for any mother,

00:19:09.005 --> 00:19:12.485
what is the greatest pleasure, which I have told you many times, is that

00:19:12.685 --> 00:19:15.505
to see her children enjoying each other,

00:19:15.725 --> 00:19:20.825
loving each other. And when I see all of you

00:19:21.025 --> 00:19:25.145
loving each other and pulling each other's legs

00:19:25.365 --> 00:19:29.285
and pinching everyone and enjoying each other's company,

00:19:29.485 --> 00:19:32.525
I really enjoy. And when you shout at each other

00:19:32.745 --> 00:19:38.185
and also sometimes box each other, I like it. (Laughter.)

00:19:38.405 --> 00:19:40.825
Because there is an expression of love in it.

00:19:41.025 --> 00:19:44.645
And that is what we have to learn, how to express ourselves.

00:19:44.865 --> 00:19:48.645
First, express yourself to your fellow being that are

00:19:48.865 --> 00:19:51.845
your kith and kin, are Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:52.065 --> 00:19:55.625
They are your brothers and they are your sisters.

00:19:55.825 --> 00:19:59.185
Like once Christ was told, "Your brother and sisters have come."

00:19:59.365 --> 00:20:02.885
He said, "Who are My brothers and who are My sisters?"

00:20:03.065 --> 00:20:06.245
These are His brothers and these are His sisters!

00:20:06.425 --> 00:20:08.265
He is the eldest brother you have

00:20:08.465 --> 00:20:11.465
and you are all His brothers and sisters.

00:20:11.665 --> 00:20:13.485
That is how one should understand

00:20:13.665 --> 00:20:17.385
that this is a relationship of brother and sister.

00:20:17.585 --> 00:20:20.265
And that's such a pure relationship.

00:20:20.445 --> 00:20:23.905
Now, when this relationship goes off,

00:20:24.125 --> 00:20:28.405
you get into troubles. Very much into troubles.

00:20:28.745 --> 00:20:32.445
Whenever I went to Cambridge, I found the Vishnumaya

00:20:32.645 --> 00:20:34.485
would just go on bombarding there.

00:20:34.685 --> 00:20:37.965
Every time there used to be lightening, lightening, lightening.

00:20:38.165 --> 00:20:40.805
This time it was at least hundred and eight times,

00:20:41.005 --> 00:20:43.045
there was bombardment when I was there.

00:20:43.225 --> 00:20:45.445
Whole night I couldn't sleep, I was wondering.

00:20:45.645 --> 00:20:47.945
But now I realized what was the reason is

00:20:48.145 --> 00:20:49.965
that in Cambridge University,

00:20:50.165 --> 00:20:52.965
it's a university just like Oxford, any other university,

00:20:53.165 --> 00:20:56.525
but Cambridge University is one of the most important universities.

00:20:56.705 --> 00:20:58.905
In that university there are young people,

00:20:59.085 --> 00:21:01.305
young boys, young girls studying.

00:21:01.505 --> 00:21:04.345
In an university the relationship between

00:21:04.545 --> 00:21:07.565
brother and sister should be absolutely pure.

00:21:07.785 --> 00:21:13.405
So pure that generations together we cannot marry.

00:21:13.625 --> 00:21:16.445
As we have in our country, the gotras.

00:21:16.665 --> 00:21:18.845
What are the gotras? Are the universities.

00:21:19.045 --> 00:21:23.465
And people cannot marry in the same gotra for generations together.

00:21:23.685 --> 00:21:25.885
Even now supposing my gotra is Shandilya,

00:21:26.045 --> 00:21:28.845
which was, must be, thirteen fourteen thousands years back.

00:21:29.045 --> 00:21:33.405
And even today I cannot marry a person who is from the same gotra.

00:21:33.605 --> 00:21:37.105
So imagine, such purity was maintained and that is what it is.

00:21:37.305 --> 00:21:40.585
In a university, there is no purity maintained.

00:21:40.765 --> 00:21:42.985
That's the reason in Cambridge, I found, that

00:21:43.165 --> 00:21:46.025
whenever I go there, Vishnumaya goes on just...

00:21:46.225 --> 00:21:48.845
I don't know, She could just goes mad.

00:21:49.065 --> 00:21:52.265
And every time we have had this experience.

00:21:52.445 --> 00:21:54.105
And now I know the reason,

00:21:54.285 --> 00:21:57.705
so I am sure next time She won't do that.

00:22:00.385 --> 00:22:04.525
Is very important, specially in young age, to understand

00:22:04.705 --> 00:22:07.125
that we have to keep our attention very still.

00:22:07.325 --> 00:22:09.625
If you do not gather wisdom in young age,

00:22:09.845 --> 00:22:12.925
you can never have wisdom in old age.

00:22:13.125 --> 00:22:16.585
In young age you must try to gather wisdom. Is very important.

00:22:16.785 --> 00:22:19.865
And this wisdom comes from Shri Ganesha, as you know.

00:22:20.065 --> 00:22:23.245
And what is Shri Ganesha? Is innocence,

00:22:23.445 --> 00:22:28.185
is purity and also is knowledge.

00:22:28.385 --> 00:22:31.885
From that it comes to you and that purity

00:22:32.105 --> 00:22:35.625
has to be kept the way Shri Ganesha had kept

00:22:35.845 --> 00:22:39.785
in His own incarnation as Christ.

00:22:40.005 --> 00:22:43.565
So we have to understand that our attention has to be

00:22:43.785 --> 00:22:48.105
so pure, so pure that it should not waste

00:22:48.305 --> 00:22:50.445
anyone of our energies.

00:22:50.625 --> 00:22:54.005
You know that with purity in your eyes,

00:22:54.185 --> 00:22:57.185
even a glance, even a glance

00:22:57.385 --> 00:23:01.805
can create such a beautiful life for others. Even a glance.

00:23:02.005 --> 00:23:06.785
So, one has to try, is to get very pure eyes.

00:23:06.985 --> 00:23:09.605
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:23:09.825 --> 00:23:12.365
This is what we have to follow, all of us,

00:23:12.565 --> 00:23:14.825
and our attention has to be all right.

00:23:15.025 --> 00:23:18.345
For that this Raksha Bandhan is a very good thing.

00:23:18.565 --> 00:23:21.365
Is a very good thing in which you create

00:23:21.585 --> 00:23:24.445
such personality of your own that

00:23:24.645 --> 00:23:29.665
you do not anymore try to put your attention on the wrong thing.

00:23:29.885 --> 00:23:32.885
Now, this attention goes out with many other things also,

00:23:33.105 --> 00:23:36.885
like aggressiveness, can be possessiveness.

00:23:37.065 --> 00:23:42.365
But the main thing is this, that if you do not have

00:23:42.565 --> 00:23:46.385
lust in your eyes, fifty percent you are all right.

00:23:46.565 --> 00:23:49.185
And half or fifty percent is greed,

00:23:49.385 --> 00:23:51.525
for which you have to work on the Nabhi chakra

00:23:51.725 --> 00:23:54.485
and which we'll work it out on Diwali day.

00:23:54.685 --> 00:23:57.285
So for today, I think we have to remember

00:23:57.485 --> 00:24:01.785
that to get rid of all the lust from our eyes,

00:24:01.985 --> 00:24:07.765
we are celebrating today this beautiful auspicious day

00:24:07.985 --> 00:24:13.105
to celebrate the love between brothers and sisters.

00:24:13.305 --> 00:24:16.665
Now, I don't know whom you have chosen to be your new sister today.

00:24:16.865 --> 00:24:22.045
But it should not be just a thing of a lip service.

00:24:22.265 --> 00:24:24.965
Sister is a sister and all your life

00:24:25.145 --> 00:24:27.205
you have to remember she is your sister.

00:24:27.405 --> 00:24:33.265
You have to look after her benevolence and her good life

00:24:33.485 --> 00:24:38.585
and she has to bless you or she has to pray to God

00:24:38.785 --> 00:24:41.705
that you should be always protected.

00:24:41.905 --> 00:24:44.885
May God bless you all.

00:24:45.405 --> 00:24:51.445
So now, if you have anybody between yourselves...

00:24:51.645 --> 00:24:54.685
Now, have you got the Rakhis?

00:24:56.425 --> 00:24:58.865
Aah, we must... today I must say

00:24:59.065 --> 00:25:01.205
that poor Warren had to go back to Shudy Camps,

00:25:01.405 --> 00:25:04.045
because nobody is there and Shudy Camp is alone,

00:25:04.245 --> 00:25:07.045
so somebody has to go and tie Rakhi to him.

00:25:07.265 --> 00:25:09.405
But he tied a Rakhi to me, a first of all, you see,

00:25:09.585 --> 00:25:11.385
is very clever fellow.

00:25:11.565 --> 00:25:14.605
And taken away my watch.

00:25:22.825 --> 00:25:25.165
Alright.

00:25:25.385 --> 00:25:29.725
In such a big group it's not easy to do all the

00:25:29.925 --> 00:25:35.225
rituals we did last time, alright? But -, now.

00:25:40.365 --> 00:25:44.085
[INAUDIBLE]

00:25:51.845 --> 00:25:54.385
Now, first of all,

00:25:54.585 --> 00:25:58.885
the girls who want to tie Rakhi

00:25:59.065 --> 00:26:01.305
should take it from here, one each,

00:26:01.485 --> 00:26:04.605
and go and tie to anyone you feel like.

00:26:04.785 --> 00:26:06.825
But tie to one person.

00:26:07.005 --> 00:26:11.105
And one person should tie to one person.

00:26:11.325 --> 00:26:15.805
Not that only everybody tying to one person, is not good.

00:26:16.285 --> 00:26:21.165
All right. So here it is. Now, who it is, who will give it to you?

00:26:24.785 --> 00:26:29.925
So these are here, you can take anyone you like. Now.

00:26:33.945 --> 00:26:39.425
[Shri Mataji speaking in Indian language.]

00:26:41.585 --> 00:26:46.625
So what you can do is to tie one to your...

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:50.905
one each, everybody should have. And should tie... exchange it.

00:26:51.125 --> 00:26:53.385
Is it alright?

00:26:53.605 --> 00:26:56.745
This is to be tied to the brother only, but

00:26:56.945 --> 00:27:01.745
in North India they also tie to their sister.

00:27:01.965 --> 00:27:06.325
So that's here now. [?] So the sister's is on the left hand

00:27:06.545 --> 00:27:08.485
and the brother's is on the right hand.

00:27:08.705 --> 00:27:12.645
Now, how do you do it. Pass it on, to everyone.

00:27:16.085 --> 00:27:19.325
Now, don't run for one person.

00:27:26.425 --> 00:27:29.285
You can tie it... [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:29.865 --> 00:27:32.865
From Australia.

00:27:48.025 --> 00:27:51.645
Somebody else should come here to distribute.

00:27:52.765 --> 00:27:56.985
Antonio, just take it. Take it, from here.

00:27:58.125 --> 00:28:00.785
They are only two, we can give it to the leaders

00:28:00.985 --> 00:28:04.505
or something, here, separately.

00:28:09.385 --> 00:28:14.105
I'm sorry for delay, but I was cooking for all of you well...

00:28:30.545 --> 00:28:33.285
You should read this after.

00:28:33.465 --> 00:28:36.885
It's alright. So I'll take this?

00:28:37.085 --> 00:28:43.425
Now, should we... we can sing some songs also, while distributing.

00:28:52.185 --> 00:28:55.205
Perhaps some music?

00:28:59.005 --> 00:29:03.185
Today I am sorry, we'll not have any pujas because I am really...

00:29:03.385 --> 00:29:05.665
I'll have three pujas now, one after another.

00:29:05.885 --> 00:29:08.005
It will be too much. We had Bhoomi Puja

00:29:08.185 --> 00:29:10.865
and now we are going to have, I mean, alright?

00:29:11.065 --> 00:29:14.225
Krishna Puja, then Ganesha Puja, then Devi Puja,

00:29:14.405 --> 00:29:17.905
so it's going to be too much. So I would request you that this is...

00:29:18.085 --> 00:29:22.145
Today it's just like a puja after all, isn't it?

00:29:23.625 --> 00:29:26.925
Very good. This one.

00:29:27.165 --> 00:29:30.025
Helen will take all my things.

00:29:31.105 --> 00:29:35.125
This is a... I don't think we'll need that.

00:29:38.465 --> 00:29:41.505
Come along, come along!
