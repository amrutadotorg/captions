00:00:00.031 --> 00:00:25.026
Today I was thinking of talking, telling you
about the Sahaja Culture.

00:00:25.105 --> 00:00:31.636
Now we are formed in dharma, Vishwa Dharma.

00:00:32.221 --> 00:00:35.291
But it must have a culture.

00:00:35.291 --> 00:00:42.890
So far in all the religions there is no combination
of religion and culture.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.420
No religion has.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.810
That's why everywhere you find different cultures.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:54.560
Say in India, people who follow Hindu religion
have different cultures in different places.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.191
They are living in Lucknow, or say in U.P.,
they have a Muslim culture.

00:01:00.191 --> 00:01:02.471
More Islamic style.

00:01:02.471 --> 00:01:07.761
They'll eat in one plate, do all kinds of
things which normally a South Indian won't

00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:13.441
do, and the South Indians have a different
culture from Maharashtrians.

00:01:13.441 --> 00:01:19.771
So even in a religion like Hindu religion
where culture is important, very important,

00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:22.191
we find varieties.

00:01:22.191 --> 00:01:28.180
So the cultures get influenced by the neighboring
cultures or surrounding cultures, and that's

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.341
how people get lost.

00:01:33.341 --> 00:01:38.391
When you establish a religion like this, Vishwa
Dharma, it's not like any other religion.

00:01:38.391 --> 00:01:45.091
It's the real religion within us, and this
reality comes to us because now we are one

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:46.571
with the Spirit.

00:01:46.571 --> 00:01:52.871
So when we talk of Sahaja Culture, it is the
culture of the Spirit.

00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:53.871
Now what is a culture?

00:01:53.871 --> 00:01:56.421
First of all let us see what is a culture
is.

00:01:56.421 --> 00:02:02.151
So the culture is the pattern of behavior
we have with others.

00:02:02.151 --> 00:02:07.211
Is a common pattern of behavior we are supposed
to have with others.

00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:11.551
Like in English language, for example, we'll
say "Thank you".

00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:15.911
Even if somebody murders, you may say, "Thank
you".

00:02:15.911 --> 00:02:22.931
Or the person who murders you can say, "Sorry".

00:02:22.931 --> 00:02:27.811
On the phone one may say, just if they say
something you can't hear, "Sorry?"

00:02:27.811 --> 00:02:28.811
Every time, "Sorry".

00:02:28.811 --> 00:02:31.082
As if "sorry" is a word so easily to be used.

00:02:31.082 --> 00:02:33.781
I mean if you are sorry, why are you sorry
for that?

00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:34.781
"Sorry?"

00:02:34.781 --> 00:02:38.631
On the phone they used to first say, "I beg
your pardon?", was sensible; but now I find

00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:41.851
everybody, A to Z, says, "Sorry?"

00:02:41.851 --> 00:02:45.591
I mean, it has no meaning, because what are
you sorry about?

00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:47.071
Says "Sorry?"

00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:48.682
For everything they are sorry.

00:02:48.682 --> 00:02:50.781
Or we can say in English language, when we
speak, "I'm afraid".

00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:53.241
You see, it's very common, "I'm afraid".

00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.381
What are you afraid of?

00:02:55.381 --> 00:02:56.981
The whole world is afraid of you.

00:02:56.981 --> 00:03:06.061
So this is the culture, what we talk of, any
culture as such, becomes artificial, is not

00:03:06.061 --> 00:03:08.241
spontaneous, doesn't come from reality.

00:03:08.241 --> 00:03:15.431
It has no meaning; sometimes it is pointless,
absolutely pointless to stick to certain cultures.

00:03:15.431 --> 00:03:18.841
So the culture of the Spirit doesn't change.

00:03:18.841 --> 00:03:24.961
It's universal, and is higher than any other
culture.

00:03:24.961 --> 00:03:27.461
Apart from that it integrates all the essences
of all the cultures.

00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:36.261
So
it emanates from the spirit.

00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:39.611
Now, spirit has two sides.

00:03:39.611 --> 00:03:44.293
One side which you see, the another you don't
see, like the moon.

00:03:44.293 --> 00:03:50.241
The side you see is outside with other people,
other Sahaja Yogis, other people, other societies,

00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:58.021
which are not yourself, absolutely.

00:03:58.021 --> 00:04:05.571
The other side you don't see is the relationship
with God Almighty, relationship with your

00:04:05.571 --> 00:04:06.741
Mother.

00:04:06.741 --> 00:04:16.321
If the other side is not all right, the behavioral
side outside could become artificial, could

00:04:16.321 --> 00:04:19.861
become crooked and not Sahaj.

00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:24.131
So it's the other way round than any other
culture.

00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:25.881
To know any other culture what do we go?

00:04:25.881 --> 00:04:31.421
We see how they talk, what is their language,
how they speak, how they behave: all the outside

00:04:31.421 --> 00:04:32.801
things we get.

00:04:32.801 --> 00:04:39.041
We must know "thank you" if we want to know
English language, must know "thank you", "please",

00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:40.661
all that.

00:04:40.661 --> 00:04:46.831
But if you want to know the Sahaja culture,
you have to know your Mother, and you have

00:04:46.831 --> 00:04:48.181
to know God Almighty.

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:55.641
And the relationship between your Mother and
the God Almighty has to be absolutely perfect.

00:04:55.641 --> 00:04:59.151
Then there's no problem.

00:04:59.151 --> 00:05:07.191
But that, the relationship, if it is not all
right, you cannot have artificial Sahaj culture.

00:05:07.191 --> 00:05:09.161
That is one thing for sure.

00:05:09.161 --> 00:05:13.941
Artificial Sahaj culture is not all right.

00:05:13.941 --> 00:05:20.762
I would say that India has, in its basics,
the culture of the spirit, India has; because

00:05:20.762 --> 00:05:33.831
for traditions and traditions in India, and
for ages, people have been seeking the truth.

00:05:33.831 --> 00:05:40.891
Spiritually they are endowed, because of the
saints.

00:05:40.891 --> 00:05:49.061
They are blessed specially because they have
been seekers, not of material things, but

00:05:49.061 --> 00:05:50.951
of the spirit.

00:05:50.951 --> 00:05:58.881
Specially in Maharashtra, we should say, because
the Kundalini is there always like a magnet.

00:05:58.881 --> 00:06:04.581
People are attracted because Shri Ganesha
being the magnet, attracted towards God and

00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:05.581
spirit.

00:06:05.581 --> 00:06:10.291
So they form a pattern, but there is lot of
artificiality in that also has grown.

00:06:10.291 --> 00:06:19.411
We must admit that there is lot, lot of artificiality,
falsehood, nonsense that has grown into it,

00:06:19.411 --> 00:06:25.061
because the religion fell into the hands of,
spiritual religion fell into the hands of

00:06:25.061 --> 00:06:29.851
gross, horrible so-called Brahmins who were
not realized souls.

00:06:29.851 --> 00:06:36.071
So the whole culture has become so nonsensical
sometimes that you don't know where to look.

00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:47.031
But to have the culture, first of all, culture
is developed through meditation, by facing

00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:50.180
yourself.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:07:02.561
First of all you should face yourself, how
you feel about your Mother and about God Almighty.

00:07:02.561 --> 00:07:09.471
First of all, how much liberty you take of
your Mother?

00:07:09.471 --> 00:07:14.801
How much granted, take for granted your Mother?

00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:20.161
She's a Mahamaya.

00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:24.171
Even the first "M" is difficult to understand.

00:07:24.171 --> 00:07:32.441
So when you start taking liberties, all the
time putting your pressure on Her, all the

00:07:32.441 --> 00:07:42.210
time trying to attract Her attention, Her
time, or writing letters eleven pages, all

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.111
that, is one side.

00:07:44.111 --> 00:07:49.451
Another side is complete indifference to your
Mother.

00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:51.990
So it is to be known through your heart.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.740
You don't have to talk to Me.

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:59.380
I know whose heart is pulsating.

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:05.131
Perhaps I'm the only person who knows really
what you are.

00:08:05.131 --> 00:08:07.701
You may not be knowing yourself also.

00:08:07.701 --> 00:08:16.501
I may not say, but I know you in all details,
out of which I may say little bit, because

00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:21.311
I am too gentle to say things.

00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:23.711
Because again of Sahaj culture.

00:08:23.711 --> 00:08:29.211
Because of Sahaj culture, I cannot say everything
to you on your face.

00:08:29.211 --> 00:08:34.841
I'm correcting it, trying to correct it, correct
it; if not possible, then I say to you.

00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:38.491
Then in that you have to also see how much
worshipful you are.

00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:45.821
Some people, though they spend more time with
Me, remain with Me, want to be with Me, it

00:08:45.821 --> 00:08:51.051
is only when they feel surrendered, also.

00:08:51.051 --> 00:08:54.332
So it should not be confused: if somebody
is spending more time with Me, you should

00:08:54.332 --> 00:08:56.161
not condemn yourself for that.

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.451
It's all right.

00:08:57.451 --> 00:09:01.031
But how far you are surrendered is the point.

00:09:01.031 --> 00:09:05.841
Now, if you are surrendered, how do you see
the surrendering in a person?

00:09:05.841 --> 00:09:12.221
You see it has one side and the another is
the expression.

00:09:12.221 --> 00:09:21.791
Say a person who is surrendered doesn't talk
much to Me, doesn't talk, he listens, doesn't

00:09:21.791 --> 00:09:22.791
talk.

00:09:22.791 --> 00:09:28.161
Common sense, he listens.

00:09:28.161 --> 00:09:34.341
Even people who are very good, I've seen when
I'm talking, they'll put in their own words

00:09:34.341 --> 00:09:36.751
in between.

00:09:36.751 --> 00:09:39.230
People who are very good, I should say.

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:41.941
So the surrendering is not full.

00:09:41.941 --> 00:09:44.201
Then the time, they become very conscious
of the time.

00:09:44.201 --> 00:09:49.051
Who has made the time?

00:09:49.051 --> 00:09:52.561
But the person won't come directly and tell
Me, but tell somebody else, "Go and tell Mother,

00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:54.941
She has to go at this time."

00:09:54.941 --> 00:10:03.671
I know everything, who tells whom, who goes
to whom, who is telling someone, who is time-bound.

00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:07.211
And then I flout it.

00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:13.671
I know what time to reach, what is the auspicious
time, how it will work out.

00:10:13.671 --> 00:10:17.401
Surrendering has to be to that point, that
you shouldn't worry.

00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:21.581
I would say Dumahl is one of them who is a
very great surrendered fellow.

00:10:21.581 --> 00:10:24.781
When I went there I was very tired, and he
said.

00:10:24.781 --> 00:10:27.061
"Mother, if You want to rest You can rest."

00:10:27.061 --> 00:10:28.230
I said, "Yes, I want to rest."

00:10:28.230 --> 00:10:29.591
So he just left Me alone.

00:10:29.591 --> 00:10:35.401
I was really very tired because I had a very
long journey, and then this and that, and

00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:38.660
then I went down all the way there.

00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:41.981
I thought, "I'll lie down, and sleep off.

00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:49.251
" Of course, as I know that everything has
to be done at right time, I just went down.

00:10:49.251 --> 00:10:59.651
And we had a program of My reception at one
place in a village, and they were all waiting

00:10:59.651 --> 00:11:02.621
for Me there.

00:11:02.621 --> 00:11:03.621
And I was sleeping; he wouldn't wake Me up.

00:11:03.621 --> 00:11:04.621
He wouldn't wake Me up.

00:11:04.621 --> 00:11:08.101
He said, "Everything will be all right.

00:11:08.101 --> 00:11:11.251
Tell them when Mother will come."

00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:15.871
So there was sun on, they were all sitting
under the tree, sun was scorchingly hot.

00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:20.781
They were nicely having a nice nap under the
tree and all that.

00:11:20.781 --> 00:11:25.790
All the villagers arrived, everybody arrived,
everything worked out.

00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:30.341
And when I got up it was about five-thirty,
then he told Me that, "Mother, I didn't tell

00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:31.441
You the program."

00:11:31.441 --> 00:11:32.681
He never tells Me.

00:11:32.681 --> 00:11:36.611
If I get something written, well and good,
but, "You were sleeping, I didn't want to

00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:37.611
disturb You."

00:11:37.611 --> 00:11:38.611
"What's the program?"

00:11:38.611 --> 00:11:39.611
"It was at three o'clock."

00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:40.611
I said, "Three o'clock.

00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:41.611
Why didn't you tell Me?

00:11:41.611 --> 00:11:43.801
Why didn't you wake Me?"

00:11:43.801 --> 00:11:46.981
He said, "You were awake, I knew You were
awake, Mother.

00:11:46.981 --> 00:11:47.981
It's all right."

00:11:47.981 --> 00:11:56.291
So we started off at six o'clock.

00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.401
Sun had gone down.

00:11:57.401 --> 00:12:04.281
By that time they arranged beautiful lights
and fireworks and everything, and all the

00:12:04.281 --> 00:12:08.061
rushing about was finished, they're very well
settled.

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:13.201
And the people from distant villages had also
arrived, and they had organized them so well,

00:12:13.201 --> 00:12:18.311
and they had a proper time, and are very happy
that I came late because sun was not there,

00:12:18.311 --> 00:12:19.661
so scorchingly hot.

00:12:19.661 --> 00:12:26.451
By the time we reached about seven o'clock
it was night and they illumined the lights,

00:12:26.451 --> 00:12:32.461
and the diwali like this was put up everywhere,
and they got everything, they had sufficient

00:12:32.461 --> 00:12:34.350
time to do everything.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:43.441
Then Dumahl said, "I knew, Mother, You are
awake, and You were managing."

00:12:43.441 --> 00:12:47.431
If one can understand that, then you will
not try to organize Me.

00:12:47.431 --> 00:12:51.001
You can just tell Me, "We have to leave at
this time."

00:12:51.001 --> 00:12:57.181
But if I don't have to leave, I will not leave
whatever you may do.

00:12:57.181 --> 00:13:05.831
In My own sweet way; you will never find Me
obstinate, but I am.

00:13:05.831 --> 00:13:09.161
Because I know what is right is what is right,
and has to be done that way.

00:13:09.161 --> 00:13:12.801
But otherwise I'm very calm, I am not bothered.

00:13:12.801 --> 00:13:18.571
I never organize you, I never hurry you, I
never do anything that should upset you.

00:13:18.571 --> 00:13:28.381
Spirit is never upset, never excited, never
hurries, and never is what you call that "go-go"

00:13:28.381 --> 00:13:30.501
business.

00:13:30.501 --> 00:13:32.331
Like now, we have to go to the airport.

00:13:32.331 --> 00:13:37.351
You'll find everybody was like an aeroplane
- round, round, round, round.

00:13:37.351 --> 00:13:38.351
What has happened?

00:13:38.351 --> 00:13:39.351
"Oh, we had to go?

00:13:39.351 --> 00:13:40.351
We'd.."

00:13:40.351 --> 00:13:41.351
"We have to go, all right.

00:13:41.351 --> 00:13:42.351
So what?"

00:13:42.351 --> 00:13:48.530
The whole thing is, all these excitements
and all these things come to us because we

00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:49.850
are outside.

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.761
But if you are one with your spirit you're
absolutely calm, absolutely calm, "All right,

00:13:51.761 --> 00:13:56.361
we have to go, all right, we'll reach there.

00:13:56.361 --> 00:13:57.771
Doesn't matter."

00:13:57.771 --> 00:14:03.131
The other day we had to go for some shopping,
I was trying to buy some saris for Indian

00:14:03.131 --> 00:14:04.131
ladies.

00:14:04.131 --> 00:14:05.341
We got lost.

00:14:05.341 --> 00:14:06.831
I never bothered them at all.

00:14:06.831 --> 00:14:09.691
They were going round and round, and round
and round.

00:14:09.691 --> 00:14:13.751
And then Danny realized and said, "I think
perhaps we had to leave vibrations in all

00:14:13.751 --> 00:14:14.751
these places."

00:14:14.751 --> 00:14:16.271
I said, "Correct."

00:14:16.271 --> 00:14:19.221
And for about two hours I think, we were roaming
about.

00:14:19.221 --> 00:14:21.220
Anybody else would be saying, "What's this?

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:24.071
You can't find the place, what's the matter
with you?”

00:14:24.071 --> 00:14:25.071
Calm.

00:14:25.071 --> 00:14:30.290
We reached the shop at the right time, got
everything at the right time, did everything,

00:14:30.290 --> 00:14:31.581
came back at right time.

00:14:31.581 --> 00:14:34.821
Everything was first class, nothing went wrong.

00:14:34.821 --> 00:14:39.321
But anybody in My place, I tell you, that
time would have been, "Oh God, this, that."

00:14:39.321 --> 00:14:40.321
Why are you saving time?

00:14:40.321 --> 00:14:45.331
For what are you saving time?

00:14:45.331 --> 00:14:49.371
So we miss the present, and that's one thing
spirit never misses.

00:14:49.371 --> 00:14:52.321
It's always in the present.

00:14:52.321 --> 00:14:56.081
That's the reality.

00:14:56.081 --> 00:15:02.331
Now in the West people are very futuristic,
extremely futuristic, and their futuristicness

00:15:02.331 --> 00:15:08.231
sometimes takes them to points, say for example
if they have to go by train.

00:15:08.231 --> 00:15:11.551
So instead of arriving at the right station,
they'll go to the station which is further

00:15:11.551 --> 00:15:13.551
on.

00:15:13.551 --> 00:15:15.241
And then again they'll arrive at the further
on.

00:15:15.241 --> 00:15:17.771
The train will never reach them.

00:15:17.771 --> 00:15:21.391
Sort of temperament they have.

00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:28.071
So one should not plan at all anything like
that, that fixes you.

00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:33.021
But at this moment, if I have to be told that
we have to go at this time, is all right,

00:15:33.021 --> 00:15:34.021
finished now.

00:15:34.021 --> 00:15:36.171
At this moment I've told, is recorded, finished.

00:15:36.171 --> 00:15:37.171
All right?

00:15:37.171 --> 00:15:39.611
So it's gone into the memory.

00:15:39.611 --> 00:15:41.281
There's nothing to worry about it now.

00:15:41.281 --> 00:15:43.761
Now, present moment, what are we doing?

00:15:43.761 --> 00:15:47.611
In a very calm way, witness it.

00:15:47.611 --> 00:15:50.361
Witness yourself, now, witness yourself.

00:15:50.361 --> 00:15:53.901
"Where is my mind going?"

00:15:53.901 --> 00:15:59.371
Now somebody who has to cook must be thinking,
"Oh, I have to get this, I have to get that."

00:15:59.371 --> 00:16:04.401
Once you start saying that "I have to do it",
you'll never be able to do it that way.

00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:11.111
But you said, "All right, just now I'm in
meditation."

00:16:11.111 --> 00:16:14.711
Every moment, "I am in meditation."

00:16:14.711 --> 00:16:21.131
Everything will walk up to you, even matter,
and you'll get the right things at the right

00:16:21.131 --> 00:16:23.701
place.

00:16:23.701 --> 00:16:28.260
You'll meet right people at the right place.

00:16:28.260 --> 00:16:31.671
The other day we were just walking, strolling
around.

00:16:31.671 --> 00:16:33.671
Whom do we find there?

00:16:33.671 --> 00:16:34.671
Carolyn.

00:16:34.671 --> 00:16:36.461
She just walked out.

00:16:36.461 --> 00:16:40.921
There is she, I mean I met her.

00:16:40.921 --> 00:16:42.820
She said, "Christine is just next door."

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:47.031
I said, "Let's go," and you should have seen
the joy on her face when she came down, and

00:16:47.031 --> 00:16:48.701
she saw Me.

00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:53.221
Beautiful experience for Me and her, she was
so happy.

00:16:53.221 --> 00:16:55.981
Then we went together.

00:16:55.981 --> 00:17:02.981
So when you have so much tied down with your
watch, that means you are not tied down with

00:17:02.981 --> 00:17:05.351
your spirit.

00:17:05.351 --> 00:17:13.230
So a Sahaja yogi, if he sees watch, then he's
not a Sahaja yogi.

00:17:13.230 --> 00:17:18.401
But the other side could be that the Sahaja
yogis are never in time where they have to

00:17:18.401 --> 00:17:20.021
be.

00:17:20.021 --> 00:17:22.421
Very common in England.

00:17:22.421 --> 00:17:26.331
I reach always first, to open the door.

00:17:26.331 --> 00:17:33.511
And to clean it also sometimes.

00:17:33.511 --> 00:17:41.510
Now, to take for granted things, as you say,
take for granted, that's not the way Sahaja

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:42.510
Yoga is.

00:17:42.510 --> 00:17:45.380
You have to be alert, alert, absolutely alert.

00:17:45.380 --> 00:17:49.331
If you are alert, immediately you'll know
"I have to go now at this time.

00:17:49.331 --> 00:17:51.591
I have to do it.

00:17:51.591 --> 00:17:55.461
I have to get this thing now."

00:17:55.461 --> 00:17:59.221
If you have to miss something, you are supposed
to miss it.

00:17:59.221 --> 00:18:00.771
That's what it is.

00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:06.010
So, there's a beautiful thing written down,
like they say, "Jai sei rakhahu tase hi rahun"

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:11.411
- "The way You keep me, the way I am, will
be happy."

00:18:11.411 --> 00:18:16.010
So, satisfaction towards yourself, your spirit,
is important.

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:24.051
Because ego will plan out, "Oh, we'll go there,
we must get for Mother, say, daisies", we

00:18:24.051 --> 00:18:25.051
decide.

00:18:25.051 --> 00:18:26.051
"Must get daisies."

00:18:26.051 --> 00:18:27.251
You don't find daisies, you're disappointed.

00:18:27.251 --> 00:18:28.251
Why not?

00:18:28.251 --> 00:18:32.471
These are all My flowers, whether they are
daisies or not, they look so nice.

00:18:32.471 --> 00:18:36.021
Whatever you get, you get it.

00:18:36.021 --> 00:18:37.921
That's the thing wanted.

00:18:37.921 --> 00:18:44.171
You know that, that the Divine is working
out everything for you.

00:18:44.171 --> 00:18:48.821
When you are supposed to get something else,
better have it.

00:18:48.821 --> 00:18:56.531
Even by mistake, if I lay My hand upon some
things, like a book or something, immediately

00:18:56.531 --> 00:19:00.841
I'll open it out and see why this book has
come in My attention; why this fellow has

00:19:00.841 --> 00:19:05.120
come in My attention; why this is happening.

00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:11.102
And immediately I find that there’s some
connection, something has to be done, something

00:19:11.102 --> 00:19:14.591
has to be said, something has to be worked
out.

00:19:14.591 --> 00:19:25.971
So for a person who is imbibed with the culture
of spirit, the Sahaj culture, impresses others

00:19:25.971 --> 00:19:30.051
by his calmness and relaxed attitude.

00:19:30.051 --> 00:19:34.321
Relaxation never means lethargy, by any chance.

00:19:34.321 --> 00:19:36.380
It doesn't mean lethargy.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.331
Lethargy is against relaxation.

00:19:39.331 --> 00:19:42.401
A person who is relaxed cannot become lethargic.

00:19:42.401 --> 00:19:47.911
"Relaxed" means a person who’s alert and
calm.

00:19:47.911 --> 00:20:00.031
These two things for human beings is an impossibility,
because if they are alert, if they are alert

00:20:00.031 --> 00:20:02.281
then they're not calm.

00:20:02.281 --> 00:20:08.451
If they're unhappy, sad, then they think they
are very, very calm.

00:20:08.451 --> 00:20:13.231
So this is one of the things one has to remember,
that you have to witness yourself all the

00:20:13.231 --> 00:20:15.141
time.

00:20:15.141 --> 00:20:17.211
Not to condemn yourself, but witness.

00:20:17.211 --> 00:20:20.750
Now I said the word "witness" means "detached".

00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:26.232
Now what happens with this, when you start
condemning yourself, you miss every good point.

00:20:26.232 --> 00:20:37.721
For example, you have some experience of a
sudden height being achieved.

00:20:37.721 --> 00:20:39.130
All right?

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:46.041
At that point you should catch hold of it,
hold on to it, keep doing, but don't forget

00:20:46.041 --> 00:20:49.820
that you may go back, no.

00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.911
And then wait for another higher moment to
come, hold on to it.

00:20:53.911 --> 00:20:56.620
That's how you climb Himalayas.

00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:58.951
But not that, "Oh Ma.

00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:02.421
Now it's all right, but what will happen next?"

00:21:02.421 --> 00:21:09.711
Then you are gone down, because you have to
face yourself in the way, knowing what are

00:21:09.711 --> 00:21:10.711
your powers.

00:21:10.711 --> 00:21:15.351
You are a spirit now, you are no more an ordinary
human being, so you have no business to condemn

00:21:15.351 --> 00:21:21.510
yourself, or to degrade yourself, or in any
way to feel unhappy.

00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:22.521
No way.

00:21:22.521 --> 00:21:24.051
Past is past.

00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:26.591
What happened a moment before is finished.

00:21:26.591 --> 00:21:27.591
"Now I am going to rise.

00:21:27.591 --> 00:21:32.971
Now I am going to rise."

00:21:32.971 --> 00:21:45.301
So a person who has a Sahaja culture is not
only spontaneous, but is inspired, is a inspired

00:21:45.301 --> 00:21:47.291
personality.

00:21:47.291 --> 00:21:57.931
A person who is of that kind, an inspired
visionary, then other people get impressed

00:21:57.931 --> 00:22:05.021
by such a person that, "See, there's a man
who's inspired, who talks in an inspired way,

00:22:05.021 --> 00:22:09.531
in a way that is something very different
from others."

00:22:09.531 --> 00:22:15.571
Something new he says, new that is nourishing.

00:22:15.571 --> 00:22:22.651
Such a personality - like the other day, you
see, we heard the lectures of so many people,

00:22:22.651 --> 00:22:29.120
and when the New Zealand Prime Minister was
coming C.P. said, "Now let's go back, because

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:30.541
we'll have a little tea or something."

00:22:30.541 --> 00:22:32.370
I said: "No, you listen to this man.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:33.370
He's a realized soul."

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:34.370
He said, "Really?"

00:22:34.370 --> 00:22:35.681
I said, "Yes, you listen to him."

00:22:35.681 --> 00:22:39.641
First everybody was, "He's sitting in New
Zealand, such a little titwit of a country,

00:22:39.641 --> 00:22:41.561
what is he going to speak?"

00:22:41.561 --> 00:22:43.531
You see, they were moving about, making a…

00:22:43.531 --> 00:22:48.321
Within two minutes he captured everybody's
attention, you see, and he was bubbling with

00:22:48.321 --> 00:22:55.010
everything, so beautifully, and he spoke all
the points so much different, and so much

00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:56.521
new and so much better.

00:22:56.521 --> 00:22:57.521
C.P. was amazed.

00:22:57.521 --> 00:22:59.231
He said, "How do You know?"

00:22:59.231 --> 00:23:04.481
I said, "I know, because when I was in New
Zealand I told them he's a realized soul."

00:23:04.481 --> 00:23:08.620
And our own Prime Minister is also a realized
soul.

00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:12.191
You'll be surprised, after our Prime Minister
finished his lecture and all that, after two

00:23:12.191 --> 00:23:18.110
or three lectures he was to go; then he turned
round and went to this Australian [Shri Mataji

00:23:18.110 --> 00:23:22.971
may have meant New Zealand] Prime Minister,
only him, went and congratulated him, congratulated

00:23:22.971 --> 00:23:23.971
him.

00:23:23.971 --> 00:23:26.781
Congratulated and said something very close
to him.

00:23:26.781 --> 00:23:30.471
And the fellow again, you see, flew up into
joy.

00:23:30.471 --> 00:23:32.250
We see it's all there.

00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:34.151
And then he came away.

00:23:34.151 --> 00:23:35.151
Why?

00:23:35.151 --> 00:23:40.261
Because one realized soul understands another
realized soul, and everybody was amazed: why

00:23:40.261 --> 00:23:44.401
did he turn to this man alone, and went and
congratulated him?

00:23:44.401 --> 00:23:51.531
So such a large country like India represented
by our Prime Minister, goes down all the way

00:23:51.531 --> 00:23:57.221
to a little country like New Zealand which
is nothing compared to India, and congratulates.

00:23:57.221 --> 00:23:59.951
And that's a developed country, this is a
developing country.

00:23:59.951 --> 00:24:02.501
Is something people did not understand.

00:24:02.501 --> 00:24:06.151
And the whole joyous atmosphere both of them
shaking hands created.

00:24:06.151 --> 00:24:15.731
This is Sahaja culture, in which you recognize
a realized soul, the dignity of a realized

00:24:15.731 --> 00:24:17.001
soul.

00:24:17.001 --> 00:24:23.221
So when it comes to relating to others, first
and foremost are Sahaja yogis.

00:24:23.221 --> 00:24:30.620
But I've seen most of the people are more
congenial with others, and less congenial

00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.431
with Sahaja yogis.

00:24:33.431 --> 00:24:39.781
They try to criticize Sahaja yogis all the
time, and I test them.

00:24:39.781 --> 00:24:41.151
I sometimes say, "All right.

00:24:41.151 --> 00:24:44.481
I don't think this fellow is very good" and
all that.

00:24:44.481 --> 00:24:48.821
But when the other person turns round and
shows compassion and says, "No, Mother, I

00:24:48.821 --> 00:24:53.240
think it will work out" then I like it.

00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:54.951
I like that.

00:24:54.951 --> 00:24:58.291
Or else sometimes I say, "Oh, let them go
away.

00:24:58.291 --> 00:25:01.591
There should be no more food for them, it's
all right."

00:25:01.591 --> 00:25:05.271
No, Mother, we've made food for them."

00:25:05.271 --> 00:25:09.641
So the culture of Sahaj is to give.

00:25:09.641 --> 00:25:15.931
Give, and give, and give, and never ask for
a reward.

00:25:15.931 --> 00:25:18.380
Never thinks, "What I have to get".

00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:25.061
After all, you have got the highest that anybody
could get.

00:25:25.061 --> 00:25:30.621
They said the three heights a human being
can achieve in spirituality, which you all

00:25:30.621 --> 00:25:32.891
got in no time.

00:25:32.891 --> 00:25:40.120
It's called as salokya, samipya, sanidya.

00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.401
Salokya is that you should be able to see
God.

00:25:45.401 --> 00:25:49.051
That you got.

00:25:49.051 --> 00:25:56.231
Samipya is the closeness with God.

00:25:56.231 --> 00:26:01.311
Sanidya is the togetherness, togetherness.

00:26:01.311 --> 00:26:09.481
You have got all these three.

00:26:09.481 --> 00:26:12.990
In one incarnation you've got it.

00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:26.251
When Gods incarnated before, nobody knew that
they were Gods.

00:26:26.251 --> 00:26:29.971
So even they got it, they never knew.

00:26:29.971 --> 00:26:35.721
Very few people knew about them.

00:26:35.721 --> 00:26:45.051
But even when Christ said He was the Son of
God, who, how many believed Him?

00:26:45.051 --> 00:26:47.481
They crucified Him.

00:26:47.481 --> 00:26:50.781
Because they were not realized souls.

00:26:50.781 --> 00:26:56.431
But by giving you realization I have given
you that capacity to get all these three blessings

00:26:56.431 --> 00:26:58.431
at one shot.

00:26:58.431 --> 00:27:03.391
I speak your language, I speak your style,
I live with your style, and you understand

00:27:03.391 --> 00:27:04.391
Me.

00:27:04.391 --> 00:27:05.601
There is no problem.

00:27:05.601 --> 00:27:11.161
But with other Gods, imagine if I were Mahakali
today, what would have happened.

00:27:11.161 --> 00:27:18.321
You would be all upside-down there hanging,
seeing Me from the other way round.

00:27:18.321 --> 00:27:22.801
I don't know what would have happened - or
any one of them.

00:27:22.801 --> 00:27:33.510
So the three blessings that a saint is promised,
you've got all of them.

00:27:33.510 --> 00:27:40.011
But because you've got them, you don't understand.

00:27:40.011 --> 00:27:41.490
You take it for granted.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.500
There's no shraddha.

00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:53.211
With this experience there should be tremendous
faith.

00:27:53.211 --> 00:28:01.120
Faith is a thing that resides between Me and
you, in between.

00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:05.241
Is we can say, the ocean of joy that is in
between.

00:28:05.241 --> 00:28:17.500
Whatever I emit to you is that shraddha, and
when you are drenched into it, the joy of

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:26.391
that shraddha makes everything so sahaj.

00:28:26.391 --> 00:28:33.421
But for that you must open your hearts.

00:28:33.421 --> 00:28:43.141
A Sahaja yogi who is secretive, who is insular,
who is jealous, who separates himself from

00:28:43.141 --> 00:28:46.120
others is no good.

00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:49.171
Open your heart.

00:28:49.171 --> 00:28:55.271
Give away your things, doesn't matter.

00:28:55.271 --> 00:29:01.740
Matter has only one value, that it can communicate
your Sahaj culture.

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:16.821
Little things, you see, I see something that
you have got beautiful, and in My Mahamaya

00:29:16.821 --> 00:29:21.181
acting on Myself I say, "Oh, that's very beautiful."

00:29:21.181 --> 00:29:30.221
and then they say, "Mother, You gave us this."

00:29:30.221 --> 00:29:33.091
"Ah, sorry."

00:29:33.091 --> 00:29:38.471
And then I feel very ashamed of Myself, that
this is not Sahaj culture, you see.

00:29:38.471 --> 00:29:42.271
But the joy is so much that I can't help it
sometimes I say, "Oh, I - it's so beautiful,

00:29:42.271 --> 00:29:43.531
this one."

00:29:43.531 --> 00:29:47.671
"You gave us, Mother."

00:29:47.671 --> 00:29:52.711
And the whole rapport and the whole feeling;
I feeling a little shy about it, and all,

00:29:52.711 --> 00:30:00.041
they're so beautiful, so dramatic; so dramatic
it is, so poetic.

00:30:00.041 --> 00:30:03.321
Only at that point I feel ashamed of Myself.

00:30:03.321 --> 00:30:09.891
Of course to be human being you should be
ashamed of yourself sometimes.

00:30:09.891 --> 00:30:11.281
Otherwise the drama is not complete.

00:30:11.281 --> 00:30:17.941
So the whole thing is so beautiful and so
joyous.

00:30:17.941 --> 00:30:23.051
But that gentleness towards others and yourself
should be there.

00:30:23.051 --> 00:30:29.271
Now if you become unhappy and serious, you
are very unkind to yourself and to others.

00:30:29.271 --> 00:30:35.161
Anybody who is a serious person, sits with
a serious face, know that he is not a Sahaja

00:30:35.161 --> 00:30:36.721
yogi at all.

00:30:36.721 --> 00:30:40.110
They should be bubbling with laughter, joy
all the time.

00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:45.271
I cannot be serious for more than, I think,
five seconds perhaps.

00:30:45.271 --> 00:30:47.681
I don't know.

00:30:47.681 --> 00:30:52.081
I try, because lectures should be serious
to go into the hearts of the people.

00:30:52.081 --> 00:30:58.951
But there's not, and you can see that even
when I'm getting angry, My eyes betray Me,

00:30:58.951 --> 00:31:04.611
and there's a twinkle of laughter in the eyes.

00:31:04.611 --> 00:31:10.031
That's how a person should be, and don't worry
what others have to say.

00:31:10.031 --> 00:31:16.380
You see, the culture where people are just
glum like this, is the same as the people

00:31:16.380 --> 00:31:17.801
where they are frivolous.

00:31:17.801 --> 00:31:26.380
Now as we can say American culture is to be
frivolous, stupid, you see, I won't be surprised

00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:28.621
supposing your Prime Minister tomorrow starts
wearing a sari, just to amuse you.

00:31:28.621 --> 00:31:38.260
Anything is possible with them, just to amuse
you, you see, too - for cheap popularity.

00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:40.401
Anything frivolous, stupid, they will do.

00:31:40.401 --> 00:31:47.941
But supposing, you see, it is say an English
old conservative personality, then a lady

00:31:47.941 --> 00:31:56.821
might wear a very official dress with the
lines and this and that, and like a man she

00:31:56.821 --> 00:32:02.471
might become very soon, like that, develop
a very serious face.

00:32:02.471 --> 00:32:06.281
But both things are nonsensical, has no meaning.

00:32:06.281 --> 00:32:13.831
You have to be natural, and natural everything
is always bubbling with joy.

00:32:13.831 --> 00:32:15.561
And a message.

00:32:15.561 --> 00:32:16.561
And a message.

00:32:16.561 --> 00:32:24.421
These flowers are the message of My coming,
writ large on them.

00:32:24.421 --> 00:32:31.651
So a person who is a Sahaj culture man should
emit that message to others, people should

00:32:31.651 --> 00:32:33.490
see, "Oh, this is the man.

00:32:33.490 --> 00:32:36.021
He is the sahaja fellow."

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:37.021
You can see that clearly.

00:32:37.021 --> 00:32:38.571
There's no seriousness, there's no unhappiness,
nothing.

00:32:38.571 --> 00:32:44.651
Supposing I have said something that might
be upsetting you, forget it.

00:32:44.651 --> 00:32:51.031
If you cannot forget that, then you have not
listened to Me.

00:32:51.031 --> 00:32:53.961
But "forget" doesn't mean that you do not
act upon it.

00:32:53.961 --> 00:32:59.870
"Acting upon it" means that you face yourself
and see for yourself how you have ascended

00:32:59.870 --> 00:33:03.071
and how far you have to go, not how you'll
fall down.

00:33:03.071 --> 00:33:08.831
So it is all the time acting on both sides,
as I'm telling you in My lecture, that on

00:33:08.831 --> 00:33:15.141
one side you'll see to yourself as relationship
with Me, and relationship with others.

00:33:15.141 --> 00:33:28.761
For a Sahaja yogi it should not matter whether
you are in a palace or on the street.

00:33:28.761 --> 00:33:32.750
The first encounter with the first Sahaja
yogis - we have only one surviving, now here

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:40.260
sitting down - they couldn't bear, for them
it was difficult to be in the beautiful atmosphere

00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:41.260
of India.

00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:47.211
The reason is, they were analyzing: they have
no good bathrooms, no showers.

00:33:47.211 --> 00:33:50.610
But you have the whole sky.

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:53.250
You have all the mountains.

00:33:53.250 --> 00:33:54.570
You have all the trees.

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:57.580
You have got all the waters flowing.

00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:04.330
But you want to have a little shower, in which
you can't even move.

00:34:04.330 --> 00:34:11.010
Just an idea, just an idea of comfort.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:16.931
You have no comforts, if you ask Me, compared
to what we have in India.

00:34:16.931 --> 00:34:18.560
No comforts at all.

00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:24.680
I mean, ask any Indian girl to come and stay,
she will cry.

00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:30.670
Even I think here the President, the President
has to wash his utensils perhaps, maybe.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:32.831
What a comfort.

00:34:32.831 --> 00:34:36.450
There's no division of labor.

00:34:36.450 --> 00:34:41.151
Now in our country we have servants, but "servants"
doesn't mean that we cheat them anything else.

00:34:41.151 --> 00:34:43.770
They eat the same food as we eat.

00:34:43.770 --> 00:34:45.651
They live the same way we live.

00:34:45.651 --> 00:34:49.631
But they do different type of work, because
they don't have the same mental capacity to

00:34:49.631 --> 00:34:51.891
be the President.

00:34:51.891 --> 00:34:56.520
The President does some other work.

00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:59.891
You have no comfort of any kind, you take
it from Me.

00:34:59.891 --> 00:35:02.941
Food matter, you get everything processed
food.

00:35:02.941 --> 00:35:07.940
Imagine, any time you might be developing
cancer due to processed food.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:10.550
What is your speciality then?

00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:12.290
Try to understand.

00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:17.451
What is the kind of food: it's not fresh,
God knows how it is processed, how it is preserved,

00:35:17.451 --> 00:35:18.540
from where it is coming.

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:24.631
Suddenly in London they said that, "Don't
eat this kind of food," you see, "because

00:35:24.631 --> 00:35:26.980
it has got something contaminated."

00:35:26.980 --> 00:35:31.371
So everybody rushes, you see, to the store
room, because we have to store up all these

00:35:31.371 --> 00:35:32.371
things.

00:35:32.371 --> 00:35:33.371
You can't get at the right….

00:35:33.371 --> 00:35:36.891
"Oh it's there"; then you start throwing them
out.

00:35:36.891 --> 00:35:46.931
It's a mad racing because people think that,
"God knows what we are eating today, is it

00:35:46.931 --> 00:35:48.121
correct or not?"

00:35:48.121 --> 00:35:51.960
So food-wise you are zero.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:58.941
Best thing is to live in the villages or in
the forests, to get the fresh fruits, wash

00:35:58.941 --> 00:36:08.980
them in clean flowing water of a river, eat
it nicely and sit down enjoying the sun.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:15.871
The comfort of the spirit is the thing we
have lost, and those who seek the comfort

00:36:15.871 --> 00:36:21.800
of the spirit are Sahaja yogis, not otherwise.

00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.700
Comfort of the spirit comes in giving.

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:32.980
Say I've borrowed some money from you, I won't
be comfortable till I've paid you back.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:39.510
Going further with it, supposing you are caught
up into something, you have got some problems.

00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:44.181
I'll somehow or other manage that you'll come
close to Me somewhere, and work it out on

00:36:44.181 --> 00:36:45.891
you, clear you out, finished.

00:36:45.891 --> 00:36:50.950
Till then I won't be comfortable; though I'll
suffer, I'll have pains, I'll have this, that.

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:54.750
As soon as I came here, left Nabhi was like
this going on.

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:55.750
Corrected it.

00:36:55.750 --> 00:36:59.091
I took it upon Myself, I sucked it into Me.

00:36:59.091 --> 00:37:02.381
So they are adventurous.

00:37:02.381 --> 00:37:07.780
"Oh I will not touch, I am catching, he's
catching."

00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:08.780
Finished.

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:13.371
But now the compassion can only work out if
you have that kind of a spirit, otherwise

00:37:13.371 --> 00:37:14.520
you cannot.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.240
It becomes sympathy.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:21.861
For example there's one person, Mr. A. or
Miss A. or Mrs. A., whatever it is.

00:37:21.861 --> 00:37:27.290
I mean, I'm just talking of a common personality,
and that person is catching.

00:37:27.290 --> 00:37:31.251
I would say in an ashram, that person should
clear out.

00:37:31.251 --> 00:37:36.550
But all the ashramites will catch from that
person, and that person will never be all

00:37:36.550 --> 00:37:37.820
right.

00:37:37.820 --> 00:37:40.661
There's a very nice joke about it.

00:37:40.661 --> 00:37:44.141
There was a lady, she wanted to reduce herself.

00:37:44.141 --> 00:37:46.480
So there was a machine like a rolling-pin.

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.550
They said, "If you rub it, then you will reduce."

00:37:50.550 --> 00:37:55.300
So she brought, poor thing, she brought the
machine and she started rolling it.

00:37:55.300 --> 00:38:06.160
She found that the rolling-pin became fat,
instead of she reducing.

00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.510
Same thing is in Sahaja yoga.

00:38:10.510 --> 00:38:13.770
Instead of Sahaja yogis correcting the others,
they get contaminated.

00:38:13.770 --> 00:38:15.611
That's why I said, "Don't have anybody in
the ashram."

00:38:15.611 --> 00:38:19.300
Because you sympathize.

00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:24.480
You do not try to correct that person, in
a way that you can correct within yourselves,

00:38:24.480 --> 00:38:26.940
suck it within yourself as your Mother does,
and do it.

00:38:26.940 --> 00:38:32.111
I do it for thousands and thousands and thousands;
you have to do it for one or two, so you are

00:38:32.111 --> 00:38:33.111
never bothered.

00:38:33.111 --> 00:38:34.720
And that's how you become strong.

00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:39.160
Not by shunning them, running away from them
or condemning yourself, or saying that: "We

00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.480
must save ourselves on the boat."

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:44.480
No.

00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:45.941
Through adventure.

00:38:45.941 --> 00:38:47.831
"Let's see what happens".

00:38:47.831 --> 00:38:50.680
Tamara was telling Me, "Nothing catches me,
Mother, what is it?"

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:53.310
I said: "But who will catch you?

00:38:53.310 --> 00:38:59.000
Those who will catch will be hurt themselves."

00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.481
So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established.

00:39:02.481 --> 00:39:09.201
Sidha kala mane Bhairav' - as you have to
establish Shri Ganesha, you have to establish

00:39:09.201 --> 00:39:11.960
also Bhairava, and Hanumana on the right side.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:17.891
If these three deities you establish within
yourself, nothing, nothing on this earth can

00:39:17.891 --> 00:39:18.891
catch you.

00:39:18.891 --> 00:39:22.451
You'll catch it for a while.

00:39:22.451 --> 00:39:26.160
But what I find now, I came to this ashram,
everybody's left Nabhi caught up.

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.700
Everybody's left Agnya caught up.

00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.240
So then I get the pain.

00:39:32.240 --> 00:39:33.240
Everyone.

00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:36.101
I mean, I have put you inside My body, do
you know that?

00:39:36.101 --> 00:39:41.810
You are part and parcel of My body, you are
the cells in My body.

00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:50.690
And when you catch, I also catch; not catch,
but I really get the pain, but I clear it.

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:53.621
In the same way, I have given you powers.

00:39:53.621 --> 00:40:01.141
Every power I have, I have given you.

00:40:01.141 --> 00:40:08.540
But you have to develop it and you have to
be adventurous.

00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:13.900
But on the contrary, once we have ashrams,
everybody settles down, "Oh, now, very comfortable,

00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:14.900
very cheap."

00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.081
Very economical, that's the first comfort.

00:40:18.081 --> 00:40:28.591
It's surprising, for a Western person, it
is very important that it should be economical,

00:40:28.591 --> 00:40:36.960
surprising, affluent people think more of
saving money than the people who are poor.

00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:46.210
And English are the last word, save pounds,
at the cost of others.

00:40:46.210 --> 00:40:49.891
On the contrary if you go to India, where
they’ll be very happy, they'll invite you

00:40:49.891 --> 00:40:51.131
in their house.

00:40:51.131 --> 00:40:54.730
Whatever they have they will give it to you,
"Eat, eat, eat."

00:40:54.730 --> 00:40:55.730
They'll force you.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:40:57.480
They'll be very happy to give.

00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:01.081
But in England it's very dangerous, you see.

00:41:01.081 --> 00:41:04.500
Sometimes in the ashram they may not even
have food for Me.

00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.190
Really.

00:41:06.190 --> 00:41:08.930
And if you tell them, "I know.

00:41:08.930 --> 00:41:09.930
I know."

00:41:09.930 --> 00:41:10.930
You know.

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:11.930
Finished.

00:41:11.930 --> 00:41:12.930
Then what do you say?

00:41:12.930 --> 00:41:14.480
They already know it, now what to do?

00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.611
They know.

00:41:15.611 --> 00:41:23.780
So with the affluence miserliness grows, and
money-orientation.

00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:29.200
In India also I've seen people who get little
more money than the rest become very money-oriented.

00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:34.070
Money becomes everything, money becomes the
power, money becomes their life.

00:41:34.070 --> 00:41:37.871
Sahaja yogi doesn't care for money.

00:41:37.871 --> 00:41:42.960
Just.. is the dust of our Mother's feet.

00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:45.921
What is money, what is wealth?

00:41:45.921 --> 00:41:51.201
And when they do like that, then their money
problems are solved.

00:41:51.201 --> 00:41:54.150
If you have a money problem, know that there's
a problem.

00:41:54.150 --> 00:42:00.180
If you are very particular about money.

00:42:00.180 --> 00:42:04.800
I am, in a way, because if I have to give
somebody, I remember it.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.780
But I've seen people who are very anxious
to tell Me that, "You have to pay this man

00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:09.780
so much, that man so much."

00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:10.780
That's wrong.

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:13.121
That's not your look-out.

00:42:13.121 --> 00:42:18.320
That's very, very wrong to tell Me that, "You
have to pay this man or that man."

00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:20.181
It's not important.

00:42:20.181 --> 00:42:23.930
Even if I don't pay, I pay him.

00:42:23.930 --> 00:42:29.851
So in relationship with Me, you are not to
tell Me that, "You have to pay so much money

00:42:29.851 --> 00:42:33.911
to him, this much money should be paid, this
is what he owes You."

00:42:33.911 --> 00:42:34.990
Nothing of the kind.

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:37.510
Let the person come and tell Me.

00:42:37.510 --> 00:42:38.861
Why are you telling?

00:42:38.861 --> 00:42:43.520
That kind of a message if you give Me, you
are lost.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:48.911
Or if you come and tell Me for somebody else
that, "Mother, time is up, we have to go.

00:42:48.911 --> 00:42:51.160
Somebody is hurrying You up."

00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:57.520
If somebody is hurrying Me, tell him, "Don't
hurry Mother."

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:09.550
You must know that your kundalinis were not
raised with just your own kundalini, but something

00:43:09.550 --> 00:43:11.320
that is working it out.

00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:16.181
Something very tremendous, a big organization.

00:43:16.181 --> 00:43:20.070
You can't see it, it is microscopic.

00:43:20.070 --> 00:43:24.250
You must know, nobody got realization like
that, did they?

00:43:24.250 --> 00:43:26.450
Thousands getting realization, what's happening?

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:28.820
There must be something about…

00:43:28.820 --> 00:43:34.040
Now how can you tell anything to such an organization?

00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:35.040
They don't like it.

00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:36.460
They know it.

00:43:36.460 --> 00:43:40.471
Actually they are the ones who know, not the
English.

00:43:40.471 --> 00:43:43.470
They know what is to be done.

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:50.300
So your relationship with Me acts as your
culture.

00:43:50.300 --> 00:43:56.750
So it is a Mother's cult, you can call it,
the Mother's culture.

00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:59.412
How we are connected with our Mother.

00:43:59.412 --> 00:44:06.210
I have seen people, if somebody is rude to
them, they get very angry.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.621
But if somebody is rude to Me they don't feel
angry.

00:44:09.621 --> 00:44:13.671
It should be the other way round.

00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:16.831
Now I'll give you an example.

00:44:16.831 --> 00:44:23.230
This Merv Griffin was funny, and both our
PRO’s were very angry.

00:44:23.230 --> 00:44:24.930
It was natural and very…

00:44:24.930 --> 00:44:28.070
I mean, I liked it, but I calmed them down.

00:44:28.070 --> 00:44:30.220
And Worlikar of course was on top of this
thing.

00:44:30.220 --> 00:44:33.191
But the other fellow would not.

00:44:33.191 --> 00:44:36.460
He was giving arguments.

00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:37.990
I was just watching.

00:44:37.990 --> 00:44:41.621
I mean, if somebody had said this to his mother...

00:44:41.621 --> 00:44:49.671
There's another one there, he never came to
receive Me at the airport.

00:44:49.671 --> 00:45:00.050
So Worlikar said, "If your own mother had
come, you would not have gone?"

00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:03.970
Then one can give explanation, "Oh, but our
Mother is Adi Shakti.

00:45:03.970 --> 00:45:06.190
My mother is not, she's helpless."

00:45:06.190 --> 00:45:07.190
It's not.

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:12.331
To show your respect, to show your love, you
have to go; for your own gain, not for Her

00:45:12.331 --> 00:45:13.331
gain.

00:45:13.331 --> 00:45:17.000
For your own gain.

00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.641
This relationship is for your own gain.

00:45:20.641 --> 00:45:30.260
Supposing if you strike oil, is it for your
gain or for the gain of the oil?

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:36.820
If you get to the Source, is it for the Source
to gain anything, or it is for you to gain

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.820
anything?

00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:40.601
Logic, simple logic.

00:45:40.601 --> 00:45:49.760
So in that culture, you see, you really thrive
and you become extremely a happy person, a

00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:52.280
joyous person.

00:45:52.280 --> 00:46:01.621
And the expression of such a person is so
different, because such a person, as I told

00:46:01.621 --> 00:46:08.400
you, rises above and sees the problems of
others, the decadence of the society, sees

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:13.710
all the problems of the world.

00:46:13.710 --> 00:46:17.451
Not only that, but knows the solutions.

00:46:17.451 --> 00:46:27.260
We are not like these ordinary people who
have racialism, this.. other diseases, I don't

00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:30.211
know what sort of diseases they have, I also
forget.

00:46:30.211 --> 00:46:32.941
Racialism now, it's another stupid nonsense,
you know.

00:46:32.941 --> 00:46:34.480
What is racialism?

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:40.050
God has made somebody's color like this and
somebody's color like that, and those same

00:46:40.050 --> 00:46:51.601
racists are trying to tan their faces.

00:46:51.601 --> 00:46:58.530
So in this culture of ours we are not bothered
about superficial things.

00:46:58.530 --> 00:47:07.510
What we are bothered about is our inner cleanliness,
inner beauty, but that doesn't mean that you

00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:13.310
should move about like primitive people, no.

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:16.331
But if there is inner beauty, then outer beauty
comes.

00:47:16.331 --> 00:47:18.910
You will never find Me dirtily dressed.

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:24.530
You will never find Me without a sari on,
even when I sleep I wear a sari, because in

00:47:24.530 --> 00:47:35.611
the night also I have to work, so how can
I go in My dressing-gown to the other world?

00:47:35.611 --> 00:47:42.810
So a person who is a Sahaja yogi has to be
an extremely neat and a clean person, but

00:47:42.810 --> 00:47:46.440
not to tell others, but should be himself
or herself.

00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:51.220
That's one of the things are very important,
because others will see you, like loonies,

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:53.570
who's going to believe you?

00:47:53.570 --> 00:47:59.780
So the one effect is from the Mother, you
take from the Source, for what?

00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:08.631
To be that illuminated quality, in you, so
that others see you as something great and

00:48:08.631 --> 00:48:12.680
adore you, worship you.

00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:17.770
This is this far we have come, now, how your
personality should be.

00:48:17.770 --> 00:48:23.710
But now, when you are dealing with others,
know that they are human beings made by God,

00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:28.800
not by Sahaja yogis by any chance.

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:33.651
And they will be tomorrow's Sahaja yogis,
may be higher Sahaja yogis than you.

00:48:33.651 --> 00:48:40.500
So when we are dealing with others also, talk
to them in a gentle way.

00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:41.520
Be kind to them.

00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:45.391
Of course we are against gurus, against cults,
against all these people.

00:48:45.391 --> 00:48:52.930
But as soon as they come, if you say: "Oh,
you are a bhoot", the person will do right-about-turn

00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:56.820
and go away.

00:48:56.820 --> 00:49:07.601
So you are not given this power to be abrupt
or to be arrogant with others, not given.

00:49:07.601 --> 00:49:15.310
Now all such people are coming down, calming
down because they see that what helps is your

00:49:15.310 --> 00:49:20.081
gentle, kindly, firm attitude.

00:49:20.081 --> 00:49:23.060
Only after Sahaja Yoga you can combine all
these qualities.

00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:32.010
You'll be firm, you'll be alert, you'll be
gentle and compassionate, smiling, but not

00:49:32.010 --> 00:49:33.810
making fun of others.

00:49:33.810 --> 00:49:43.810
So then you become a personality who is alert:
to see what is the reaction they're having

00:49:43.810 --> 00:49:46.770
on others, this is very important to be seen.

00:49:46.770 --> 00:49:50.140
So now you start witnessing others.

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:52.290
What is your reaction on others?

00:49:52.290 --> 00:49:57.910
I have seen many a times, a new Sahaja yogi
comes in.

00:49:57.910 --> 00:50:04.980
The person is trying to say something, and
the girl starts giggling or laughing.

00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:09.871
One should not, at that time, because the
person might think that, "They're making fool

00:50:09.871 --> 00:50:15.101
of me, or they're thinking that I'm a stupid
person, or something wrong with me."

00:50:15.101 --> 00:50:18.900
That person will become self-conscious, I
won't be able to give realization to that

00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:20.060
person.

00:50:20.060 --> 00:50:27.050
But if somebody is sitting before Me and I'm
trying to help that person, know that it's

00:50:27.050 --> 00:50:33.560
a very important moment of this gentleman's
life.

00:50:33.560 --> 00:50:35.621
We have got it, so what?

00:50:35.621 --> 00:50:42.710
When we are pulling out somebody, when we
are helping out somebody, do we laugh?

00:50:42.710 --> 00:50:51.621
That's the time you have to be very concerned
and very much serious, to do the job.

00:50:51.621 --> 00:50:57.030
Every quality and mood has its own place,
like nose is at its own place, eyes at its

00:50:57.030 --> 00:50:58.030
own place.

00:50:58.030 --> 00:51:07.730
In the same way, all these moods that we have,
have their own places.

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:13.430
And that is what is lost in modern society.

00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:20.550
So when I am trying to help somebody, you
should be all concern about that person.

00:51:20.550 --> 00:51:24.230
How does this come in to us from the Source?

00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:27.361
How much you are concerned about Me?

00:51:27.361 --> 00:51:33.900
Supposing I am thirsty, you will feel thirsty.

00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.601
You'll immediately say, "Mother, I'll get
You some water."

00:51:36.601 --> 00:51:40.670
But you may not even ask Me, just bring it
here, keep it there.

00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:43.631
Or just make some tea for Me or look after
Me.

00:51:43.631 --> 00:51:47.040
Do this or do that.

00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:50.220
In little, little things you should watch.

00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:53.861
The concern is not in saying something, asking
something.

00:51:53.861 --> 00:51:55.331
You don't ask.

00:51:55.331 --> 00:52:04.700
Don't ask Mother, you just do it.

00:52:04.700 --> 00:52:09.060
That's how, when you start doing it, you will
understand what you are doing to others.

00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:16.852
So the reflection on others, how they reflect
about you also is very important, and you

00:52:16.852 --> 00:52:20.900
have to be alert.

00:52:20.900 --> 00:52:23.940
Suddenly you say something, and everybody
disappears.

00:52:23.940 --> 00:52:27.911
You must know they are not yet Sahaja yogis,
they are to be brought in, so you have to

00:52:27.911 --> 00:52:34.241
very carefully bring them around.

00:52:34.241 --> 00:52:41.260
Then with Sahaja yogis, among yourselves how
you behave is extremely important for others

00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:43.220
to see.

00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:51.111
We must cherish each other's company, we must
cherish.

00:52:51.111 --> 00:52:55.901
To meet some Sahaja yogi somewhere, "Ah, what
a joy it is to see someone, to talk to someone

00:52:55.901 --> 00:52:57.180
on the phone."

00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:04.351
But because we are so insular, so selfish,
so greedy, and sometimes very circumcised

00:53:04.351 --> 00:53:13.230
[should read 'circumscribed'] I should say,
or absolutely engulfed into our past, we cannot

00:53:13.230 --> 00:53:19.930
do that, we do not feel that joy, we cannot
adore another Sahaja yogi, we do not enjoy

00:53:19.930 --> 00:53:25.520
another Sahaja yogi, we cannot cherish his
company.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:30.290
That means this finger cannot feel this finger.

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:35.241
It's like a developing, what you call, a disease
called leprosy.

00:53:35.241 --> 00:53:37.851
Nerves are finished.

00:53:37.851 --> 00:53:40.240
Nerve endings are not there.

00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:49.190
You cannot feel the joy of other Sahaja yogis.

00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:56.111
And this is only possible if you get over
your personal interests.

00:53:56.111 --> 00:54:04.310
When people come in Sahaja Yoga in the beginning,
they have personal interests, like say somebody

00:54:04.310 --> 00:54:11.540
is trying to sell something, so they would
like to sell it to Sahaja yogis.

00:54:11.540 --> 00:54:16.131
Or they are arranging something, they would
like Sahaja yogis to do it.

00:54:16.131 --> 00:54:20.081
See, personal interest, to use Sahaja yogis
for their own purposes.

00:54:20.081 --> 00:54:28.950
As a result of that I've seen some people
become so insular that nobody helps them,

00:54:28.950 --> 00:54:33.270
no work is done by them; if there's a telephone,
nobody will say, "I'll get it."

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.060
That's American quality, they'll say, "I'll
get it."

00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.831
Is regarded good.

00:54:37.831 --> 00:54:44.500
Not in England, they'll be all sitting, quiet.

00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:49.690
Even when they have eaten the food, they have
to pay the money, they'll look this side,

00:54:49.690 --> 00:54:54.190
and some poor Indian student will pay for
all of them.

00:54:54.190 --> 00:54:55.730
"I won't look", they say.

00:54:55.730 --> 00:54:56.730
"Now paid."

00:54:56.730 --> 00:54:58.010
Now they are normal.

00:54:58.010 --> 00:55:02.200
It's very low-level.

00:55:02.200 --> 00:55:07.800
Is extremely low-level behavior.

00:55:07.800 --> 00:55:19.510
And this is what one has to learn, that you
have to cherish others, give presents to others.

00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:28.500
"You're going there; “Oh, now…"; like
the other day I met a lady, she had liked

00:55:28.500 --> 00:55:33.210
one of My rings of emerald.

00:55:33.210 --> 00:55:39.670
That's My family ring so I can't give away,
you see, I'll have to ask C.P. and he may

00:55:39.670 --> 00:55:44.550
not like it, because after all I have no right
on it, I have to give it to My children, all

00:55:44.550 --> 00:55:45.550
right?

00:55:45.550 --> 00:55:49.640
But I found an emerald somewhere, beautiful,
so I kept it with Me.

00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:51.800
The other day when I gave her, she was so
enamored.

00:55:51.800 --> 00:55:55.630
I said, "You liked My ring, I couldn't give
you My ring, so.."

00:55:55.630 --> 00:55:59.150
She said to Me, "You mean to say, I would
have taken Your ring?"

00:55:59.150 --> 00:56:03.460
I said, "I would have forced it on you, but
I couldn't give you, so I thought of it.

00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.331
I just saw it somewhere so I got it for you."

00:56:06.331 --> 00:56:07.331
She said, "How thoughtful."

00:56:07.331 --> 00:56:10.660
But it's all in My head.

00:56:10.660 --> 00:56:20.170
I, whenever I get it, a chance, you see, so
somebody says, "Oh, I like it", keep it in

00:56:20.170 --> 00:56:21.170
mind.

00:56:21.170 --> 00:56:24.160
Next time, even a flower.

00:56:24.160 --> 00:56:29.050
You must cherish their companies, because
it's such a great thing to have somebody who

00:56:29.050 --> 00:56:32.341
understands you, your spirit, and they have
the spirit.

00:56:32.341 --> 00:56:34.081
Such a great thing.

00:56:34.081 --> 00:56:39.280
How can you be unkind to each other?

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.460
That hurts Me the most of all.

00:56:41.460 --> 00:56:50.941
And the first thing and the foremost thing
you have to give Me is congenial, beautiful,

00:56:50.941 --> 00:56:59.331
loving group, that they love each other.

00:56:59.331 --> 00:57:03.650
If that's achieved, that you really love,
beyond your personal considerations.

00:57:03.650 --> 00:57:11.180
I mean, of course, in Sahaja Yoga there are
now not many people who try to make money,

00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:13.310
but try to make comfort for themselves.

00:57:13.310 --> 00:57:16.770
They must have the best room, they must have
the best place, they must have...

00:57:16.770 --> 00:57:19.871
"I didn't get this, I should have it, this,
that."

00:57:19.871 --> 00:57:21.240
Try to do more than others.

00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:27.431
I know sometimes people take advantage of
you, but they will go out of Sahaja Yoga very

00:57:27.431 --> 00:57:28.431
soon.

00:57:28.431 --> 00:57:32.871
So be sure that you become generous about
it, very generous.

00:57:32.871 --> 00:57:44.331
And generosity should start from your own
Sahaja yogi brothers and sisters.

00:57:44.331 --> 00:57:53.680
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have
a full imbibement bubbling through our nerves,

00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:57.581
the sense of chastity.

00:57:57.581 --> 00:58:03.250
That is a must, whether you like it or not.

00:58:03.250 --> 00:58:15.091
There should be no bad intentions about any
other person, of relationships which are not

00:58:15.091 --> 00:58:16.091
pure.

00:58:16.091 --> 00:58:28.510
Absolutely pure relationships, pure eyes without
any adultery, adulteration I would call it.

00:58:28.510 --> 00:58:38.091
Clean eyes is the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:38.091 --> 00:58:44.940
Steadfast clean eyes, because your eyes are
very powerful.

00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:50.440
You don't know how powerful they are.

00:58:50.440 --> 00:59:02.121
So to make it that way, to practice, move
your attention inward and towards the Sahasrara.

00:59:02.121 --> 00:59:03.121
You can.

00:59:03.121 --> 00:59:07.670
With your eyes you suck in.

00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:15.000
Even by looking at Me with the shraddha, with
the joy, you just suck it inside, My image.

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:22.871
Put it on your Sahasrara, put it in your heart,
you can do it.

00:59:22.871 --> 00:59:25.170
It's very joy giving.

00:59:25.170 --> 00:59:30.960
When you put it in the Sahasrara, then you
get the knowledge.

00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:38.150
When you put it in your heart, you get the
joy; and when you put it on your liver, then

00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:43.500
you get the power of action.

00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:49.740
From the photograph also you can do it, suck
in, move it.

00:59:49.740 --> 01:00:00.700
But that is shown in the way you behave towards
others, completely confident, gentle; no arrogance.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:13.420
Neither the neck up like that or like that,
but in the center in a very dignified manner.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:27.770
So in the culture of Sahaj, because the spirit
is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:31.470
of God, you have to judge yourself.

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:37.780
"Did I say something which is not respecting
my spirit?

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:44.660
Did I do something that is not glorious?"

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:48.940
Like I've seen people, when I'm there, they'll
go on asking Me hundred questions.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.980
"Should it be white towel?

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.980
Green towel?

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.790
Should I do this, should I do that?"

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.190
Why?

01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:00.430
Because we don't live with choices.

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:05.490
We live with whatever we get it, and there
is dignity in that.

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:11.920
If you start doing choices, it's stupid.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.671
In a group of Sahaja yogis, the food, "What
will you have?"

01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:20.790
They'll take forty-five minutes to decide,
if you go in a restaurant, because the first,

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:25.570
the consciousness, "We are paying for it",
and somebody will have this, somebody will

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:26.570
have that.

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:28.910
The poor waiter will run away.

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:32.081
But why should we have different?

01:01:32.081 --> 01:01:36.391
It's just the same.

01:01:36.391 --> 01:01:43.800
Whatever Mother is having we'll have, finished.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.150
But if not that, at least whatever everybody
is having, "Why have separately?"

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:51.601
Choices are not there in Sahaja Yoga, remember
this word very clearly.

01:01:51.601 --> 01:01:55.351
Choices of this, choices of that, I don't
like it, I like that.

01:01:55.351 --> 01:02:00.121
This is not good, that is not good.

01:02:00.121 --> 01:02:08.240
Because we need everything on the level of
vibrations, then the choice is coming.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:18.000
Like, if the vibrations are not good we'll
not say it, but we'll not have it.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.010
But not question of whether green or red or
yellow or white.

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:26.891
And that is what they are making fool out
of you.

01:02:26.891 --> 01:02:32.530
They will put one name, Cartier, finished.

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:36.060
People will pay any amount for that Cartier.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.410
Is any ordinary stuff, it is nothing special.

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.510
But you see that ego, "I've got the Cartier.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:48.780
I paid more to show that I've paid more, that
I've been a fool."

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:56.910
To pay more for something that's so cheapish;
that's what they're playing upon - remember

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:57.910
that.

01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:06.040
So you have to understand that when you are
a Sahaj personality, you have your own dignity.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.431
These things do not give dignity to you.

01:03:09.431 --> 01:03:15.871
You give them dignity.

01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:24.820
But that doesn't mean tomorrow you come like
a clown, or like a limbo on your nose.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:30.341
Of course I must see the other point always,
because it just slips out that side.

01:03:30.341 --> 01:03:37.701
When you become dignified, you will wear always
something that is dignified.

01:03:37.701 --> 01:03:39.490
You will do all that is dignified.

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:42.151
Is automatically you become dignified.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:45.540
It's nothing artificial.

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:53.160
So dignity that comes, as you see your Mother.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:59.490
Whatever you give Me in Puja I take it, all
right, but otherwise you cannot give Me anything

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:00.490
else.

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:06.730
If you give Me, I'll return it, somehow.

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:09.940
Somehow I'll return it.

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:16.371
A person who is money-oriented cannot have
dignity, because you see him like a beggar.

01:04:16.371 --> 01:04:19.491
See, if there’s money-orientation is too
much, he comes down to that level, you can

01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:21.961
see it, there cannot be dignity there.

01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:26.460
A man who is power-oriented is an idiot.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.151
He looks like an idiot.

01:04:29.151 --> 01:04:30.620
So we cannot become idiots.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.620
All right.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.230
So we cannot be power-oriented.

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:42.421
The one who is sort of a romantic or a love-oriented,
is a stupid fellow.

01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:44.710
He behaves like a stupid fellow.

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:48.050
On the street they go on kissing each other
all the time.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.611
"Where are you going?"

01:04:49.611 --> 01:04:56.530
"To the divorce case, but last bit we are
thinking of having some kisses."

01:04:56.530 --> 01:05:00.421
Self-respect is the thing.

01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:01.820
Self is your spirit.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.040
The respect of the spirit should give you
that dignity.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:11.160
But in privacy you are gentle with your husband,
you are gentle with your wife.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:18.400
You must learn how to be gentle with her in
privacy, not in public.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.120
That's horrible.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.280
Specially in India.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.101
I am told that people go round with that romanticism
and all that.

01:05:25.101 --> 01:05:31.440
So please, don't do all those romantic stuff
in India, it's very embarrassing for Me, very

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.591
embarrassing.

01:05:32.591 --> 01:05:37.591
So we cannot do things which embarrasses our
Mother.

01:05:37.591 --> 01:05:42.370
Once you start knowing that, "This will embarrass
Mother, we can't do this", automatically you

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.370
are helping.

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:49.851
So when it is related with Me, immediately,
"What will Mother think of in me?

01:05:49.851 --> 01:05:51.970
Is this the way to behave towards Mother?"

01:05:51.970 --> 01:06:03.720
Immediately you will get the reward, as that
thing working through you, as if you become

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.841
that nature.

01:06:04.841 --> 01:06:08.240
Sahaja culture is a sahaja nature.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.390
Automatically you will do it.

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:18.361
You'll talk in that manner, you will speak
in that manner, you’ll live in that manner.

01:06:18.361 --> 01:06:24.641
I mean, I have seen people who have never
known Me, on a trunk call or a telephone,

01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:25.841
they recognize.

01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:30.670
They know I am something special; if they
are sensitive enough.

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:35.210
From My photograph, the way I sit, the way
I talk, immediately everyone asks.

01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:39.040
The other day where I went for the meeting
with My husband, everybody was asking, "Who

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040
is this lady?"

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040
"Who is this lady?"

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.111
"Who is this lady?"

01:06:45.111 --> 01:06:46.460
There's something in the personality.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:53.181
I talk to everyone nicely, I'm very sweet.

01:06:53.181 --> 01:06:56.760
We cannot be slavish, and we cannot enslave
anyone.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:04.731
We have to cherish, even human beings we have
to cherish, because they are us.

01:07:04.731 --> 01:07:10.591
Not to despise anyone, not to laugh at anyone.

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:17.171
In the culture of Sahaj, you have to become
an expert: expertise.

01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:25.050
Expertise comes through your adherence to
your Mother.

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:29.730
Expertise: you all should be an expert, and
who will give you the certificate is your

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:32.260
Mother only - who else?

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:41.331
I may not say so, but your spirit will say
that, and not your ego.

01:07:41.331 --> 01:07:47.609
In this short time whatever was possible,
it's such a big subject, culture is; you cannot.

01:07:47.609 --> 01:07:54.399
But I've talked to you, I would not say in
a very analytical way, but in a very synthetic

01:07:54.399 --> 01:07:56.569
manner.

01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:59.370
So I've given you very synthesis of the whole
thing.

01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:06.230
"Analytical" would be one, two, three, four,
five - cut short - two, three, four, five,

01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:07.260
like that.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.340
It's not like that.

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.701
And that is how you have to speak to people.

01:08:11.701 --> 01:08:16.649
One, this is so; two, this is so; three, this
is so; finished.

01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:18.549
You are not Sahaja yogis.

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:25.680
In your speeches if you talk like that, finished.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:31.749
But before saying something or doing something,
give a little idea where you are leading the

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:38.029
people, so they are not frittered away, attention
is not frittered away.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:49.919
Give a little idea, as I say, or else while
talking, bring them to a point which is important,

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.801
so that they wait in the sentence to come
to that point.

01:08:55.801 --> 01:09:02.460
But make the whole sentence look so, that
it is going towards certain points, so always

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:11.951
a Sahaja yogi must make a point out of what
they talk, not just babbling, talking.

01:09:11.951 --> 01:09:15.940
What is the point you are going to make?

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:21.451
Whatever they do, they have to know, "What
are we going to achieve out of it?"

01:09:21.451 --> 01:09:22.630
Now, marriage.

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:25.320
"What are we going to achieve out of marriage?"

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.161
A family, house, everybody has, even a donkey
has that.

01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:31.300
What's so great?

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:37.021
We are going to achieve a family unit where
realized souls are to be born, we're going

01:09:37.021 --> 01:09:48.791
to look after them in a proper way, and then
we are going to emit that unit into this world,

01:09:48.791 --> 01:09:56.630
like a sparkling diamond set in the beautiful
setting of a family, giving light to the whole

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:59.670
world.

01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:09.931
So one's life should not be pointless, and
talk should not be pointless, and every moment

01:10:09.931 --> 01:10:20.820
should be filled with achievements of your
visions and dreams, slowly and steadily, which

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:26.661
is not at all difficult.

01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:32.920
If you can get rid of ego and superego, finished,
that's all - simple as that.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:43.021
May God bless you all.

01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:53.110
Mm.. good.. nice.. relaxed, eh?

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:55.130
Relaxed.

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:57.150
Witness.

01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:06.701
Everyone cleared out, I think.

01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:12.951
And no more… one more thing I must say last,
as I've said it before, which I've not said

01:11:12.951 --> 01:11:18.351
here, no-one is going to say that bhoot did
it, because such a person will be sent away

01:11:18.351 --> 01:11:22.481
to the bhoot clan, not to Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:22.481 --> 01:11:27.440
Don't put your responsibility on the bhoots.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:32.311
Either you are a bhoot or you are a Sahaja
yogi, one of the two, you can't be both.
