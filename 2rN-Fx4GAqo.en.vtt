00:00.031 --> 00:25.026
Today I was thinking of talking, telling you
about the Sahaja Culture.

00:25.105 --> 00:31.636
Now we are formed in dharma, Vishwa Dharma.

00:32.221 --> 00:35.291
But it must have a culture.

00:35.291 --> 00:42.890
So far in all the religions there is no combination
of religion and culture.

00:42.890 --> 00:45.420
No religion has.

00:45.420 --> 00:48.810
That's why everywhere you find different cultures.

00:48.810 --> 00:54.560
Say in India, people who follow Hindu religion
have different cultures in different places.

00:54.560 --> 01:00.191
They are living in Lucknow, or say in U.P.,
they have a Muslim culture.

01:00.191 --> 01:02.471
More Islamic style.

01:02.471 --> 01:07.761
They'll eat in one plate, do all kinds of
things which normally a South Indian won't

01:07.761 --> 01:13.441
do, and the South Indians have a different
culture from Maharashtrians.

01:13.441 --> 01:19.771
So even in a religion like Hindu religion
where culture is important, very important,

01:19.771 --> 01:22.191
we find varieties.

01:22.191 --> 01:28.180
So the cultures get influenced by the neighboring
cultures or surrounding cultures, and that's

01:28.180 --> 01:33.341
how people get lost.

01:33.341 --> 01:38.391
When you establish a religion like this, Vishwa
Dharma, it's not like any other religion.

01:38.391 --> 01:45.091
It's the real religion within us, and this
reality comes to us because now we are one

01:45.091 --> 01:46.571
with the Spirit.

01:46.571 --> 01:52.871
So when we talk of Sahaja Culture, it is the
culture of the Spirit.

01:52.871 --> 01:53.871
Now what is a culture?

01:53.871 --> 01:56.421
First of all let us see what is a culture
is.

01:56.421 --> 02:02.151
So the culture is the pattern of behavior
we have with others.

02:02.151 --> 02:07.211
Is a common pattern of behavior we are supposed
to have with others.

02:07.211 --> 02:11.551
Like in English language, for example, we'll
say "Thank you".

02:11.551 --> 02:15.911
Even if somebody murders, you may say, "Thank
you".

02:15.911 --> 02:22.931
Or the person who murders you can say, "Sorry".

02:22.931 --> 02:27.811
On the phone one may say, just if they say
something you can't hear, "Sorry?"

02:27.811 --> 02:28.811
Every time, "Sorry".

02:28.811 --> 02:31.082
As if "sorry" is a word so easily to be used.

02:31.082 --> 02:33.781
I mean if you are sorry, why are you sorry
for that?

02:33.781 --> 02:34.781
"Sorry?"

02:34.781 --> 02:38.631
On the phone they used to first say, "I beg
your pardon?", was sensible; but now I find

02:38.631 --> 02:41.851
everybody, A to Z, says, "Sorry?"

02:41.851 --> 02:45.591
I mean, it has no meaning, because what are
you sorry about?

02:45.591 --> 02:47.071
Says "Sorry?"

02:47.071 --> 02:48.682
For everything they are sorry.

02:48.682 --> 02:50.781
Or we can say in English language, when we
speak, "I'm afraid".

02:50.781 --> 02:53.241
You see, it's very common, "I'm afraid".

02:53.241 --> 02:55.381
What are you afraid of?

02:55.381 --> 02:56.981
The whole world is afraid of you.

02:56.981 --> 03:06.061
So this is the culture, what we talk of, any
culture as such, becomes artificial, is not

03:06.061 --> 03:08.241
spontaneous, doesn't come from reality.

03:08.241 --> 03:15.431
It has no meaning; sometimes it is pointless,
absolutely pointless to stick to certain cultures.

03:15.431 --> 03:18.841
So the culture of the Spirit doesn't change.

03:18.841 --> 03:24.961
It's universal, and is higher than any other
culture.

03:24.961 --> 03:27.461
Apart from that it integrates all the essences
of all the cultures.

03:27.461 --> 03:36.261
So
it emanates from the spirit.

03:36.261 --> 03:39.611
Now, spirit has two sides.

03:39.611 --> 03:44.293
One side which you see, the another you don't
see, like the moon.

03:44.293 --> 03:50.241
The side you see is outside with other people,
other Sahaja Yogis, other people, other societies,

03:50.241 --> 03:58.021
which are not yourself, absolutely.

03:58.021 --> 04:05.571
The other side you don't see is the relationship
with God Almighty, relationship with your

04:05.571 --> 04:06.741
Mother.

04:06.741 --> 04:16.321
If the other side is not all right, the behavioral
side outside could become artificial, could

04:16.321 --> 04:19.861
become crooked and not Sahaj.

04:19.861 --> 04:24.131
So it's the other way round than any other
culture.

04:24.131 --> 04:25.881
To know any other culture what do we go?

04:25.881 --> 04:31.421
We see how they talk, what is their language,
how they speak, how they behave: all the outside

04:31.421 --> 04:32.801
things we get.

04:32.801 --> 04:39.041
We must know "thank you" if we want to know
English language, must know "thank you", "please",

04:39.041 --> 04:40.661
all that.

04:40.661 --> 04:46.831
But if you want to know the Sahaja culture,
you have to know your Mother, and you have

04:46.831 --> 04:48.181
to know God Almighty.

04:48.181 --> 04:55.641
And the relationship between your Mother and
the God Almighty has to be absolutely perfect.

04:55.641 --> 04:59.151
Then there's no problem.

04:59.151 --> 05:07.191
But that, the relationship, if it is not all
right, you cannot have artificial Sahaj culture.

05:07.191 --> 05:09.161
That is one thing for sure.

05:09.161 --> 05:13.941
Artificial Sahaj culture is not all right.

05:13.941 --> 05:20.762
I would say that India has, in its basics,
the culture of the spirit, India has; because

05:20.762 --> 05:33.831
for traditions and traditions in India, and
for ages, people have been seeking the truth.

05:33.831 --> 05:40.891
Spiritually they are endowed, because of the
saints.

05:40.891 --> 05:49.061
They are blessed specially because they have
been seekers, not of material things, but

05:49.061 --> 05:50.951
of the spirit.

05:50.951 --> 05:58.881
Specially in Maharashtra, we should say, because
the Kundalini is there always like a magnet.

05:58.881 --> 06:04.581
People are attracted because Shri Ganesha
being the magnet, attracted towards God and

06:04.581 --> 06:05.581
spirit.

06:05.581 --> 06:10.291
So they form a pattern, but there is lot of
artificiality in that also has grown.

06:10.291 --> 06:19.411
We must admit that there is lot, lot of artificiality,
falsehood, nonsense that has grown into it,

06:19.411 --> 06:25.061
because the religion fell into the hands of,
spiritual religion fell into the hands of

06:25.061 --> 06:29.851
gross, horrible so-called Brahmins who were
not realized souls.

06:29.851 --> 06:36.071
So the whole culture has become so nonsensical
sometimes that you don't know where to look.

06:36.071 --> 06:47.031
But to have the culture, first of all, culture
is developed through meditation, by facing

06:47.031 --> 06:50.180
yourself.

06:50.180 --> 07:02.561
First of all you should face yourself, how
you feel about your Mother and about God Almighty.

07:02.561 --> 07:09.471
First of all, how much liberty you take of
your Mother?

07:09.471 --> 07:14.801
How much granted, take for granted your Mother?

07:14.801 --> 07:20.161
She's a Mahamaya.

07:20.161 --> 07:24.171
Even the first "M" is difficult to understand.

07:24.171 --> 07:32.441
So when you start taking liberties, all the
time putting your pressure on Her, all the

07:32.441 --> 07:42.210
time trying to attract Her attention, Her
time, or writing letters eleven pages, all

07:42.210 --> 07:44.111
that, is one side.

07:44.111 --> 07:49.451
Another side is complete indifference to your
Mother.

07:49.451 --> 07:51.990
So it is to be known through your heart.

07:51.990 --> 07:54.740
You don't have to talk to Me.

07:54.740 --> 07:59.380
I know whose heart is pulsating.

07:59.380 --> 08:05.131
Perhaps I'm the only person who knows really
what you are.

08:05.131 --> 08:07.701
You may not be knowing yourself also.

08:07.701 --> 08:16.501
I may not say, but I know you in all details,
out of which I may say little bit, because

08:16.501 --> 08:21.311
I am too gentle to say things.

08:21.311 --> 08:23.711
Because again of Sahaj culture.

08:23.711 --> 08:29.211
Because of Sahaj culture, I cannot say everything
to you on your face.

08:29.211 --> 08:34.841
I'm correcting it, trying to correct it, correct
it; if not possible, then I say to you.

08:34.841 --> 08:38.491
Then in that you have to also see how much
worshipful you are.

08:38.491 --> 08:45.821
Some people, though they spend more time with
Me, remain with Me, want to be with Me, it

08:45.821 --> 08:51.051
is only when they feel surrendered, also.

08:51.051 --> 08:54.332
So it should not be confused: if somebody
is spending more time with Me, you should

08:54.332 --> 08:56.161
not condemn yourself for that.

08:56.161 --> 08:57.451
It's all right.

08:57.451 --> 09:01.031
But how far you are surrendered is the point.

09:01.031 --> 09:05.841
Now, if you are surrendered, how do you see
the surrendering in a person?

09:05.841 --> 09:12.221
You see it has one side and the another is
the expression.

09:12.221 --> 09:21.791
Say a person who is surrendered doesn't talk
much to Me, doesn't talk, he listens, doesn't

09:21.791 --> 09:22.791
talk.

09:22.791 --> 09:28.161
Common sense, he listens.

09:28.161 --> 09:34.341
Even people who are very good, I've seen when
I'm talking, they'll put in their own words

09:34.341 --> 09:36.751
in between.

09:36.751 --> 09:39.230
People who are very good, I should say.

09:39.230 --> 09:41.941
So the surrendering is not full.

09:41.941 --> 09:44.201
Then the time, they become very conscious
of the time.

09:44.201 --> 09:49.051
Who has made the time?

09:49.051 --> 09:52.561
But the person won't come directly and tell
Me, but tell somebody else, "Go and tell Mother,

09:52.561 --> 09:54.941
She has to go at this time."

09:54.941 --> 10:03.671
I know everything, who tells whom, who goes
to whom, who is telling someone, who is time-bound.

10:03.671 --> 10:07.211
And then I flout it.

10:07.211 --> 10:13.671
I know what time to reach, what is the auspicious
time, how it will work out.

10:13.671 --> 10:17.401
Surrendering has to be to that point, that
you shouldn't worry.

10:17.401 --> 10:21.581
I would say Dumahl is one of them who is a
very great surrendered fellow.

10:21.581 --> 10:24.781
When I went there I was very tired, and he
said.

10:24.781 --> 10:27.061
"Mother, if You want to rest You can rest."

10:27.061 --> 10:28.230
I said, "Yes, I want to rest."

10:28.230 --> 10:29.591
So he just left Me alone.

10:29.591 --> 10:35.401
I was really very tired because I had a very
long journey, and then this and that, and

10:35.401 --> 10:38.660
then I went down all the way there.

10:38.660 --> 10:41.981
I thought, "I'll lie down, and sleep off.

10:41.981 --> 10:49.251
" Of course, as I know that everything has
to be done at right time, I just went down.

10:49.251 --> 10:59.651
And we had a program of My reception at one
place in a village, and they were all waiting

10:59.651 --> 11:02.621
for Me there.

11:02.621 --> 11:03.621
And I was sleeping; he wouldn't wake Me up.

11:03.621 --> 11:04.621
He wouldn't wake Me up.

11:04.621 --> 11:08.101
He said, "Everything will be all right.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.251
Tell them when Mother will come."

11:11.251 --> 11:15.871
So there was sun on, they were all sitting
under the tree, sun was scorchingly hot.

11:15.871 --> 11:20.781
They were nicely having a nice nap under the
tree and all that.

11:20.781 --> 11:25.790
All the villagers arrived, everybody arrived,
everything worked out.

11:25.790 --> 11:30.341
And when I got up it was about five-thirty,
then he told Me that, "Mother, I didn't tell

11:30.341 --> 11:31.441
You the program."

11:31.441 --> 11:32.681
He never tells Me.

11:32.681 --> 11:36.611
If I get something written, well and good,
but, "You were sleeping, I didn't want to

11:36.611 --> 11:37.611
disturb You."

11:37.611 --> 11:38.611
"What's the program?"

11:38.611 --> 11:39.611
"It was at three o'clock."

11:39.611 --> 11:40.611
I said, "Three o'clock.

11:40.611 --> 11:41.611
Why didn't you tell Me?

11:41.611 --> 11:43.801
Why didn't you wake Me?"

11:43.801 --> 11:46.981
He said, "You were awake, I knew You were
awake, Mother.

11:46.981 --> 11:47.981
It's all right."

11:47.981 --> 11:56.291
So we started off at six o'clock.

11:56.291 --> 11:57.401
Sun had gone down.

11:57.401 --> 12:04.281
By that time they arranged beautiful lights
and fireworks and everything, and all the

12:04.281 --> 12:08.061
rushing about was finished, they're very well
settled.

12:08.061 --> 12:13.201
And the people from distant villages had also
arrived, and they had organized them so well,

12:13.201 --> 12:18.311
and they had a proper time, and are very happy
that I came late because sun was not there,

12:18.311 --> 12:19.661
so scorchingly hot.

12:19.661 --> 12:26.451
By the time we reached about seven o'clock
it was night and they illumined the lights,

12:26.451 --> 12:32.461
and the diwali like this was put up everywhere,
and they got everything, they had sufficient

12:32.461 --> 12:34.350
time to do everything.

12:34.350 --> 12:43.441
Then Dumahl said, "I knew, Mother, You are
awake, and You were managing."

12:43.441 --> 12:47.431
If one can understand that, then you will
not try to organize Me.

12:47.431 --> 12:51.001
You can just tell Me, "We have to leave at
this time."

12:51.001 --> 12:57.181
But if I don't have to leave, I will not leave
whatever you may do.

12:57.181 --> 13:05.831
In My own sweet way; you will never find Me
obstinate, but I am.

13:05.831 --> 13:09.161
Because I know what is right is what is right,
and has to be done that way.

13:09.161 --> 13:12.801
But otherwise I'm very calm, I am not bothered.

13:12.801 --> 13:18.571
I never organize you, I never hurry you, I
never do anything that should upset you.

13:18.571 --> 13:28.381
Spirit is never upset, never excited, never
hurries, and never is what you call that "go-go"

13:28.381 --> 13:30.501
business.

13:30.501 --> 13:32.331
Like now, we have to go to the airport.

13:32.331 --> 13:37.351
You'll find everybody was like an aeroplane
- round, round, round, round.

13:37.351 --> 13:38.351
What has happened?

13:38.351 --> 13:39.351
"Oh, we had to go?

13:39.351 --> 13:40.351
We'd.."

13:40.351 --> 13:41.351
"We have to go, all right.

13:41.351 --> 13:42.351
So what?"

13:42.351 --> 13:48.530
The whole thing is, all these excitements
and all these things come to us because we

13:48.530 --> 13:49.850
are outside.

13:49.850 --> 13:51.761
But if you are one with your spirit you're
absolutely calm, absolutely calm, "All right,

13:51.761 --> 13:56.361
we have to go, all right, we'll reach there.

13:56.361 --> 13:57.771
Doesn't matter."

13:57.771 --> 14:03.131
The other day we had to go for some shopping,
I was trying to buy some saris for Indian

14:03.131 --> 14:04.131
ladies.

14:04.131 --> 14:05.341
We got lost.

14:05.341 --> 14:06.831
I never bothered them at all.

14:06.831 --> 14:09.691
They were going round and round, and round
and round.

14:09.691 --> 14:13.751
And then Danny realized and said, "I think
perhaps we had to leave vibrations in all

14:13.751 --> 14:14.751
these places."

14:14.751 --> 14:16.271
I said, "Correct."

14:16.271 --> 14:19.221
And for about two hours I think, we were roaming
about.

14:19.221 --> 14:21.220
Anybody else would be saying, "What's this?

14:21.220 --> 14:24.071
You can't find the place, what's the matter
with you?”

14:24.071 --> 14:25.071
Calm.

14:25.071 --> 14:30.290
We reached the shop at the right time, got
everything at the right time, did everything,

14:30.290 --> 14:31.581
came back at right time.

14:31.581 --> 14:34.821
Everything was first class, nothing went wrong.

14:34.821 --> 14:39.321
But anybody in My place, I tell you, that
time would have been, "Oh God, this, that."

14:39.321 --> 14:40.321
Why are you saving time?

14:40.321 --> 14:45.331
For what are you saving time?

14:45.331 --> 14:49.371
So we miss the present, and that's one thing
spirit never misses.

14:49.371 --> 14:52.321
It's always in the present.

14:52.321 --> 14:56.081
That's the reality.

14:56.081 --> 15:02.331
Now in the West people are very futuristic,
extremely futuristic, and their futuristicness

15:02.331 --> 15:08.231
sometimes takes them to points, say for example
if they have to go by train.

15:08.231 --> 15:11.551
So instead of arriving at the right station,
they'll go to the station which is further

15:11.551 --> 15:13.551
on.

15:13.551 --> 15:15.241
And then again they'll arrive at the further
on.

15:15.241 --> 15:17.771
The train will never reach them.

15:17.771 --> 15:21.391
Sort of temperament they have.

15:21.391 --> 15:28.071
So one should not plan at all anything like
that, that fixes you.

15:28.071 --> 15:33.021
But at this moment, if I have to be told that
we have to go at this time, is all right,

15:33.021 --> 15:34.021
finished now.

15:34.021 --> 15:36.171
At this moment I've told, is recorded, finished.

15:36.171 --> 15:37.171
All right?

15:37.171 --> 15:39.611
So it's gone into the memory.

15:39.611 --> 15:41.281
There's nothing to worry about it now.

15:41.281 --> 15:43.761
Now, present moment, what are we doing?

15:43.761 --> 15:47.611
In a very calm way, witness it.

15:47.611 --> 15:50.361
Witness yourself, now, witness yourself.

15:50.361 --> 15:53.901
"Where is my mind going?"

15:53.901 --> 15:59.371
Now somebody who has to cook must be thinking,
"Oh, I have to get this, I have to get that."

15:59.371 --> 16:04.401
Once you start saying that "I have to do it",
you'll never be able to do it that way.

16:04.401 --> 16:11.111
But you said, "All right, just now I'm in
meditation."

16:11.111 --> 16:14.711
Every moment, "I am in meditation."

16:14.711 --> 16:21.131
Everything will walk up to you, even matter,
and you'll get the right things at the right

16:21.131 --> 16:23.701
place.

16:23.701 --> 16:28.260
You'll meet right people at the right place.

16:28.260 --> 16:31.671
The other day we were just walking, strolling
around.

16:31.671 --> 16:33.671
Whom do we find there?

16:33.671 --> 16:34.671
Carolyn.

16:34.671 --> 16:36.461
She just walked out.

16:36.461 --> 16:40.921
There is she, I mean I met her.

16:40.921 --> 16:42.820
She said, "Christine is just next door."

16:42.820 --> 16:47.031
I said, "Let's go," and you should have seen
the joy on her face when she came down, and

16:47.031 --> 16:48.701
she saw Me.

16:48.701 --> 16:53.221
Beautiful experience for Me and her, she was
so happy.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.981
Then we went together.

16:55.981 --> 17:02.981
So when you have so much tied down with your
watch, that means you are not tied down with

17:02.981 --> 17:05.351
your spirit.

17:05.351 --> 17:13.230
So a Sahaja yogi, if he sees watch, then he's
not a Sahaja yogi.

17:13.230 --> 17:18.401
But the other side could be that the Sahaja
yogis are never in time where they have to

17:18.401 --> 17:20.021
be.

17:20.021 --> 17:22.421
Very common in England.

17:22.421 --> 17:26.331
I reach always first, to open the door.

17:26.331 --> 17:33.511
And to clean it also sometimes.

17:33.511 --> 17:41.510
Now, to take for granted things, as you say,
take for granted, that's not the way Sahaja

17:41.510 --> 17:42.510
Yoga is.

17:42.510 --> 17:45.380
You have to be alert, alert, absolutely alert.

17:45.380 --> 17:49.331
If you are alert, immediately you'll know
"I have to go now at this time.

17:49.331 --> 17:51.591
I have to do it.

17:51.591 --> 17:55.461
I have to get this thing now."

17:55.461 --> 17:59.221
If you have to miss something, you are supposed
to miss it.

17:59.221 --> 18:00.771
That's what it is.

18:00.771 --> 18:06.010
So, there's a beautiful thing written down,
like they say, "Jai sei rakhahu tase hi rahun"

18:06.010 --> 18:11.411
- "The way You keep me, the way I am, will
be happy."

18:11.411 --> 18:16.010
So, satisfaction towards yourself, your spirit,
is important.

18:16.010 --> 18:24.051
Because ego will plan out, "Oh, we'll go there,
we must get for Mother, say, daisies", we

18:24.051 --> 18:25.051
decide.

18:25.051 --> 18:26.051
"Must get daisies."

18:26.051 --> 18:27.251
You don't find daisies, you're disappointed.

18:27.251 --> 18:28.251
Why not?

18:28.251 --> 18:32.471
These are all My flowers, whether they are
daisies or not, they look so nice.

18:32.471 --> 18:36.021
Whatever you get, you get it.

18:36.021 --> 18:37.921
That's the thing wanted.

18:37.921 --> 18:44.171
You know that, that the Divine is working
out everything for you.

18:44.171 --> 18:48.821
When you are supposed to get something else,
better have it.

18:48.821 --> 18:56.531
Even by mistake, if I lay My hand upon some
things, like a book or something, immediately

18:56.531 --> 19:00.841
I'll open it out and see why this book has
come in My attention; why this fellow has

19:00.841 --> 19:05.120
come in My attention; why this is happening.

19:05.120 --> 19:11.102
And immediately I find that there’s some
connection, something has to be done, something

19:11.102 --> 19:14.591
has to be said, something has to be worked
out.

19:14.591 --> 19:25.971
So for a person who is imbibed with the culture
of spirit, the Sahaj culture, impresses others

19:25.971 --> 19:30.051
by his calmness and relaxed attitude.

19:30.051 --> 19:34.321
Relaxation never means lethargy, by any chance.

19:34.321 --> 19:36.380
It doesn't mean lethargy.

19:36.380 --> 19:39.331
Lethargy is against relaxation.

19:39.331 --> 19:42.401
A person who is relaxed cannot become lethargic.

19:42.401 --> 19:47.911
"Relaxed" means a person who’s alert and
calm.

19:47.911 --> 20:00.031
These two things for human beings is an impossibility,
because if they are alert, if they are alert

20:00.031 --> 20:02.281
then they're not calm.

20:02.281 --> 20:08.451
If they're unhappy, sad, then they think they
are very, very calm.

20:08.451 --> 20:13.231
So this is one of the things one has to remember,
that you have to witness yourself all the

20:13.231 --> 20:15.141
time.

20:15.141 --> 20:17.211
Not to condemn yourself, but witness.

20:17.211 --> 20:20.750
Now I said the word "witness" means "detached".

20:20.750 --> 20:26.232
Now what happens with this, when you start
condemning yourself, you miss every good point.

20:26.232 --> 20:37.721
For example, you have some experience of a
sudden height being achieved.

20:37.721 --> 20:39.130
All right?

20:39.130 --> 20:46.041
At that point you should catch hold of it,
hold on to it, keep doing, but don't forget

20:46.041 --> 20:49.820
that you may go back, no.

20:49.820 --> 20:53.911
And then wait for another higher moment to
come, hold on to it.

20:53.911 --> 20:56.620
That's how you climb Himalayas.

20:56.620 --> 20:58.951
But not that, "Oh Ma.

20:58.951 --> 21:02.421
Now it's all right, but what will happen next?"

21:02.421 --> 21:09.711
Then you are gone down, because you have to
face yourself in the way, knowing what are

21:09.711 --> 21:10.711
your powers.

21:10.711 --> 21:15.351
You are a spirit now, you are no more an ordinary
human being, so you have no business to condemn

21:15.351 --> 21:21.510
yourself, or to degrade yourself, or in any
way to feel unhappy.

21:21.510 --> 21:22.521
No way.

21:22.521 --> 21:24.051
Past is past.

21:24.051 --> 21:26.591
What happened a moment before is finished.

21:26.591 --> 21:27.591
"Now I am going to rise.

21:27.591 --> 21:32.971
Now I am going to rise."

21:32.971 --> 21:45.301
So a person who has a Sahaja culture is not
only spontaneous, but is inspired, is a inspired

21:45.301 --> 21:47.291
personality.

21:47.291 --> 21:57.931
A person who is of that kind, an inspired
visionary, then other people get impressed

21:57.931 --> 22:05.021
by such a person that, "See, there's a man
who's inspired, who talks in an inspired way,

22:05.021 --> 22:09.531
in a way that is something very different
from others."

22:09.531 --> 22:15.571
Something new he says, new that is nourishing.

22:15.571 --> 22:22.651
Such a personality - like the other day, you
see, we heard the lectures of so many people,

22:22.651 --> 22:29.120
and when the New Zealand Prime Minister was
coming C.P. said, "Now let's go back, because

22:29.120 --> 22:30.541
we'll have a little tea or something."

22:30.541 --> 22:32.370
I said: "No, you listen to this man.

22:32.370 --> 22:33.370
He's a realized soul."

22:33.370 --> 22:34.370
He said, "Really?"

22:34.370 --> 22:35.681
I said, "Yes, you listen to him."

22:35.681 --> 22:39.641
First everybody was, "He's sitting in New
Zealand, such a little titwit of a country,

22:39.641 --> 22:41.561
what is he going to speak?"

22:41.561 --> 22:43.531
You see, they were moving about, making a…

22:43.531 --> 22:48.321
Within two minutes he captured everybody's
attention, you see, and he was bubbling with

22:48.321 --> 22:55.010
everything, so beautifully, and he spoke all
the points so much different, and so much

22:55.010 --> 22:56.521
new and so much better.

22:56.521 --> 22:57.521
C.P. was amazed.

22:57.521 --> 22:59.231
He said, "How do You know?"

22:59.231 --> 23:04.481
I said, "I know, because when I was in New
Zealand I told them he's a realized soul."

23:04.481 --> 23:08.620
And our own Prime Minister is also a realized
soul.

23:08.620 --> 23:12.191
You'll be surprised, after our Prime Minister
finished his lecture and all that, after two

23:12.191 --> 23:18.110
or three lectures he was to go; then he turned
round and went to this Australian [Shri Mataji

23:18.110 --> 23:22.971
may have meant New Zealand] Prime Minister,
only him, went and congratulated him, congratulated

23:22.971 --> 23:23.971
him.

23:23.971 --> 23:26.781
Congratulated and said something very close
to him.

23:26.781 --> 23:30.471
And the fellow again, you see, flew up into
joy.

23:30.471 --> 23:32.250
We see it's all there.

23:32.250 --> 23:34.151
And then he came away.

23:34.151 --> 23:35.151
Why?

23:35.151 --> 23:40.261
Because one realized soul understands another
realized soul, and everybody was amazed: why

23:40.261 --> 23:44.401
did he turn to this man alone, and went and
congratulated him?

23:44.401 --> 23:51.531
So such a large country like India represented
by our Prime Minister, goes down all the way

23:51.531 --> 23:57.221
to a little country like New Zealand which
is nothing compared to India, and congratulates.

23:57.221 --> 23:59.951
And that's a developed country, this is a
developing country.

23:59.951 --> 24:02.501
Is something people did not understand.

24:02.501 --> 24:06.151
And the whole joyous atmosphere both of them
shaking hands created.

24:06.151 --> 24:15.731
This is Sahaja culture, in which you recognize
a realized soul, the dignity of a realized

24:15.731 --> 24:17.001
soul.

24:17.001 --> 24:23.221
So when it comes to relating to others, first
and foremost are Sahaja yogis.

24:23.221 --> 24:30.620
But I've seen most of the people are more
congenial with others, and less congenial

24:30.620 --> 24:33.431
with Sahaja yogis.

24:33.431 --> 24:39.781
They try to criticize Sahaja yogis all the
time, and I test them.

24:39.781 --> 24:41.151
I sometimes say, "All right.

24:41.151 --> 24:44.481
I don't think this fellow is very good" and
all that.

24:44.481 --> 24:48.821
But when the other person turns round and
shows compassion and says, "No, Mother, I

24:48.821 --> 24:53.240
think it will work out" then I like it.

24:53.240 --> 24:54.951
I like that.

24:54.951 --> 24:58.291
Or else sometimes I say, "Oh, let them go
away.

24:58.291 --> 25:01.591
There should be no more food for them, it's
all right."

25:01.591 --> 25:05.271
No, Mother, we've made food for them."

25:05.271 --> 25:09.641
So the culture of Sahaj is to give.

25:09.641 --> 25:15.931
Give, and give, and give, and never ask for
a reward.

25:15.931 --> 25:18.380
Never thinks, "What I have to get".

25:18.380 --> 25:25.061
After all, you have got the highest that anybody
could get.

25:25.061 --> 25:30.621
They said the three heights a human being
can achieve in spirituality, which you all

25:30.621 --> 25:32.891
got in no time.

25:32.891 --> 25:40.120
It's called as salokya, samipya, sanidya.

25:40.120 --> 25:45.401
Salokya is that you should be able to see
God.

25:45.401 --> 25:49.051
That you got.

25:49.051 --> 25:56.231
Samipya is the closeness with God.

25:56.231 --> 26:01.311
Sanidya is the togetherness, togetherness.

26:01.311 --> 26:09.481
You have got all these three.

26:09.481 --> 26:12.990
In one incarnation you've got it.

26:12.990 --> 26:26.251
When Gods incarnated before, nobody knew that
they were Gods.

26:26.251 --> 26:29.971
So even they got it, they never knew.

26:29.971 --> 26:35.721
Very few people knew about them.

26:35.721 --> 26:45.051
But even when Christ said He was the Son of
God, who, how many believed Him?

26:45.051 --> 26:47.481
They crucified Him.

26:47.481 --> 26:50.781
Because they were not realized souls.

26:50.781 --> 26:56.431
But by giving you realization I have given
you that capacity to get all these three blessings

26:56.431 --> 26:58.431
at one shot.

26:58.431 --> 27:03.391
I speak your language, I speak your style,
I live with your style, and you understand

27:03.391 --> 27:04.391
Me.

27:04.391 --> 27:05.601
There is no problem.

27:05.601 --> 27:11.161
But with other Gods, imagine if I were Mahakali
today, what would have happened.

27:11.161 --> 27:18.321
You would be all upside-down there hanging,
seeing Me from the other way round.

27:18.321 --> 27:22.801
I don't know what would have happened - or
any one of them.

27:22.801 --> 27:33.510
So the three blessings that a saint is promised,
you've got all of them.

27:33.510 --> 27:40.011
But because you've got them, you don't understand.

27:40.011 --> 27:41.490
You take it for granted.

27:41.490 --> 27:44.500
There's no shraddha.

27:44.500 --> 27:53.211
With this experience there should be tremendous
faith.

27:53.211 --> 28:01.120
Faith is a thing that resides between Me and
you, in between.

28:01.120 --> 28:05.241
Is we can say, the ocean of joy that is in
between.

28:05.241 --> 28:17.500
Whatever I emit to you is that shraddha, and
when you are drenched into it, the joy of

28:17.500 --> 28:26.391
that shraddha makes everything so sahaj.

28:26.391 --> 28:33.421
But for that you must open your hearts.

28:33.421 --> 28:43.141
A Sahaja yogi who is secretive, who is insular,
who is jealous, who separates himself from

28:43.141 --> 28:46.120
others is no good.

28:46.120 --> 28:49.171
Open your heart.

28:49.171 --> 28:55.271
Give away your things, doesn't matter.

28:55.271 --> 29:01.740
Matter has only one value, that it can communicate
your Sahaj culture.

29:01.740 --> 29:16.821
Little things, you see, I see something that
you have got beautiful, and in My Mahamaya

29:16.821 --> 29:21.181
acting on Myself I say, "Oh, that's very beautiful."

29:21.181 --> 29:30.221
and then they say, "Mother, You gave us this."

29:30.221 --> 29:33.091
"Ah, sorry."

29:33.091 --> 29:38.471
And then I feel very ashamed of Myself, that
this is not Sahaj culture, you see.

29:38.471 --> 29:42.271
But the joy is so much that I can't help it
sometimes I say, "Oh, I - it's so beautiful,

29:42.271 --> 29:43.531
this one."

29:43.531 --> 29:47.671
"You gave us, Mother."

29:47.671 --> 29:52.711
And the whole rapport and the whole feeling;
I feeling a little shy about it, and all,

29:52.711 --> 30:00.041
they're so beautiful, so dramatic; so dramatic
it is, so poetic.

30:00.041 --> 30:03.321
Only at that point I feel ashamed of Myself.

30:03.321 --> 30:09.891
Of course to be human being you should be
ashamed of yourself sometimes.

30:09.891 --> 30:11.281
Otherwise the drama is not complete.

30:11.281 --> 30:17.941
So the whole thing is so beautiful and so
joyous.

30:17.941 --> 30:23.051
But that gentleness towards others and yourself
should be there.

30:23.051 --> 30:29.271
Now if you become unhappy and serious, you
are very unkind to yourself and to others.

30:29.271 --> 30:35.161
Anybody who is a serious person, sits with
a serious face, know that he is not a Sahaja

30:35.161 --> 30:36.721
yogi at all.

30:36.721 --> 30:40.110
They should be bubbling with laughter, joy
all the time.

30:40.110 --> 30:45.271
I cannot be serious for more than, I think,
five seconds perhaps.

30:45.271 --> 30:47.681
I don't know.

30:47.681 --> 30:52.081
I try, because lectures should be serious
to go into the hearts of the people.

30:52.081 --> 30:58.951
But there's not, and you can see that even
when I'm getting angry, My eyes betray Me,

30:58.951 --> 31:04.611
and there's a twinkle of laughter in the eyes.

31:04.611 --> 31:10.031
That's how a person should be, and don't worry
what others have to say.

31:10.031 --> 31:16.380
You see, the culture where people are just
glum like this, is the same as the people

31:16.380 --> 31:17.801
where they are frivolous.

31:17.801 --> 31:26.380
Now as we can say American culture is to be
frivolous, stupid, you see, I won't be surprised

31:26.380 --> 31:28.621
supposing your Prime Minister tomorrow starts
wearing a sari, just to amuse you.

31:28.621 --> 31:38.260
Anything is possible with them, just to amuse
you, you see, too - for cheap popularity.

31:38.260 --> 31:40.401
Anything frivolous, stupid, they will do.

31:40.401 --> 31:47.941
But supposing, you see, it is say an English
old conservative personality, then a lady

31:47.941 --> 31:56.821
might wear a very official dress with the
lines and this and that, and like a man she

31:56.821 --> 32:02.471
might become very soon, like that, develop
a very serious face.

32:02.471 --> 32:06.281
But both things are nonsensical, has no meaning.

32:06.281 --> 32:13.831
You have to be natural, and natural everything
is always bubbling with joy.

32:13.831 --> 32:15.561
And a message.

32:15.561 --> 32:16.561
And a message.

32:16.561 --> 32:24.421
These flowers are the message of My coming,
writ large on them.

32:24.421 --> 32:31.651
So a person who is a Sahaj culture man should
emit that message to others, people should

32:31.651 --> 32:33.490
see, "Oh, this is the man.

32:33.490 --> 32:36.021
He is the sahaja fellow."

32:36.021 --> 32:37.021
You can see that clearly.

32:37.021 --> 32:38.571
There's no seriousness, there's no unhappiness,
nothing.

32:38.571 --> 32:44.651
Supposing I have said something that might
be upsetting you, forget it.

32:44.651 --> 32:51.031
If you cannot forget that, then you have not
listened to Me.

32:51.031 --> 32:53.961
But "forget" doesn't mean that you do not
act upon it.

32:53.961 --> 32:59.870
"Acting upon it" means that you face yourself
and see for yourself how you have ascended

32:59.870 --> 33:03.071
and how far you have to go, not how you'll
fall down.

33:03.071 --> 33:08.831
So it is all the time acting on both sides,
as I'm telling you in My lecture, that on

33:08.831 --> 33:15.141
one side you'll see to yourself as relationship
with Me, and relationship with others.

33:15.141 --> 33:28.761
For a Sahaja yogi it should not matter whether
you are in a palace or on the street.

33:28.761 --> 33:32.750
The first encounter with the first Sahaja
yogis - we have only one surviving, now here

33:32.750 --> 33:40.260
sitting down - they couldn't bear, for them
it was difficult to be in the beautiful atmosphere

33:40.260 --> 33:41.260
of India.

33:41.260 --> 33:47.211
The reason is, they were analyzing: they have
no good bathrooms, no showers.

33:47.211 --> 33:50.610
But you have the whole sky.

33:50.610 --> 33:53.250
You have all the mountains.

33:53.250 --> 33:54.570
You have all the trees.

33:54.570 --> 33:57.580
You have got all the waters flowing.

33:57.580 --> 34:04.330
But you want to have a little shower, in which
you can't even move.

34:04.330 --> 34:11.010
Just an idea, just an idea of comfort.

34:11.010 --> 34:16.931
You have no comforts, if you ask Me, compared
to what we have in India.

34:16.931 --> 34:18.560
No comforts at all.

34:18.560 --> 34:24.680
I mean, ask any Indian girl to come and stay,
she will cry.

34:24.680 --> 34:30.670
Even I think here the President, the President
has to wash his utensils perhaps, maybe.

34:30.670 --> 34:32.831
What a comfort.

34:32.831 --> 34:36.450
There's no division of labor.

34:36.450 --> 34:41.151
Now in our country we have servants, but "servants"
doesn't mean that we cheat them anything else.

34:41.151 --> 34:43.770
They eat the same food as we eat.

34:43.770 --> 34:45.651
They live the same way we live.

34:45.651 --> 34:49.631
But they do different type of work, because
they don't have the same mental capacity to

34:49.631 --> 34:51.891
be the President.

34:51.891 --> 34:56.520
The President does some other work.

34:56.520 --> 34:59.891
You have no comfort of any kind, you take
it from Me.

34:59.891 --> 35:02.941
Food matter, you get everything processed
food.

35:02.941 --> 35:07.940
Imagine, any time you might be developing
cancer due to processed food.

35:07.940 --> 35:10.550
What is your speciality then?

35:10.550 --> 35:12.290
Try to understand.

35:12.290 --> 35:17.451
What is the kind of food: it's not fresh,
God knows how it is processed, how it is preserved,

35:17.451 --> 35:18.540
from where it is coming.

35:18.540 --> 35:24.631
Suddenly in London they said that, "Don't
eat this kind of food," you see, "because

35:24.631 --> 35:26.980
it has got something contaminated."

35:26.980 --> 35:31.371
So everybody rushes, you see, to the store
room, because we have to store up all these

35:31.371 --> 35:32.371
things.

35:32.371 --> 35:33.371
You can't get at the right….

35:33.371 --> 35:36.891
"Oh it's there"; then you start throwing them
out.

35:36.891 --> 35:46.931
It's a mad racing because people think that,
"God knows what we are eating today, is it

35:46.931 --> 35:48.121
correct or not?"

35:48.121 --> 35:51.960
So food-wise you are zero.

35:51.960 --> 35:58.941
Best thing is to live in the villages or in
the forests, to get the fresh fruits, wash

35:58.941 --> 36:08.980
them in clean flowing water of a river, eat
it nicely and sit down enjoying the sun.

36:08.980 --> 36:15.871
The comfort of the spirit is the thing we
have lost, and those who seek the comfort

36:15.871 --> 36:21.800
of the spirit are Sahaja yogis, not otherwise.

36:21.800 --> 36:25.700
Comfort of the spirit comes in giving.

36:25.700 --> 36:32.980
Say I've borrowed some money from you, I won't
be comfortable till I've paid you back.

36:32.980 --> 36:39.510
Going further with it, supposing you are caught
up into something, you have got some problems.

36:39.510 --> 36:44.181
I'll somehow or other manage that you'll come
close to Me somewhere, and work it out on

36:44.181 --> 36:45.891
you, clear you out, finished.

36:45.891 --> 36:50.950
Till then I won't be comfortable; though I'll
suffer, I'll have pains, I'll have this, that.

36:50.950 --> 36:54.750
As soon as I came here, left Nabhi was like
this going on.

36:54.750 --> 36:55.750
Corrected it.

36:55.750 --> 36:59.091
I took it upon Myself, I sucked it into Me.

36:59.091 --> 37:02.381
So they are adventurous.

37:02.381 --> 37:07.780
"Oh I will not touch, I am catching, he's
catching."

37:07.780 --> 37:08.780
Finished.

37:08.780 --> 37:13.371
But now the compassion can only work out if
you have that kind of a spirit, otherwise

37:13.371 --> 37:14.520
you cannot.

37:14.520 --> 37:16.240
It becomes sympathy.

37:16.240 --> 37:21.861
For example there's one person, Mr. A. or
Miss A. or Mrs. A., whatever it is.

37:21.861 --> 37:27.290
I mean, I'm just talking of a common personality,
and that person is catching.

37:27.290 --> 37:31.251
I would say in an ashram, that person should
clear out.

37:31.251 --> 37:36.550
But all the ashramites will catch from that
person, and that person will never be all

37:36.550 --> 37:37.820
right.

37:37.820 --> 37:40.661
There's a very nice joke about it.

37:40.661 --> 37:44.141
There was a lady, she wanted to reduce herself.

37:44.141 --> 37:46.480
So there was a machine like a rolling-pin.

37:46.480 --> 37:50.550
They said, "If you rub it, then you will reduce."

37:50.550 --> 37:55.300
So she brought, poor thing, she brought the
machine and she started rolling it.

37:55.300 --> 38:06.160
She found that the rolling-pin became fat,
instead of she reducing.

38:06.160 --> 38:10.510
Same thing is in Sahaja yoga.

38:10.510 --> 38:13.770
Instead of Sahaja yogis correcting the others,
they get contaminated.

38:13.770 --> 38:15.611
That's why I said, "Don't have anybody in
the ashram."

38:15.611 --> 38:19.300
Because you sympathize.

38:19.300 --> 38:24.480
You do not try to correct that person, in
a way that you can correct within yourselves,

38:24.480 --> 38:26.940
suck it within yourself as your Mother does,
and do it.

38:26.940 --> 38:32.111
I do it for thousands and thousands and thousands;
you have to do it for one or two, so you are

38:32.111 --> 38:33.111
never bothered.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.720
And that's how you become strong.

38:34.720 --> 38:39.160
Not by shunning them, running away from them
or condemning yourself, or saying that: "We

38:39.160 --> 38:43.480
must save ourselves on the boat."

38:43.480 --> 38:44.480
No.

38:44.480 --> 38:45.941
Through adventure.

38:45.941 --> 38:47.831
"Let's see what happens".

38:47.831 --> 38:50.680
Tamara was telling Me, "Nothing catches me,
Mother, what is it?"

38:50.680 --> 38:53.310
I said: "But who will catch you?

38:53.310 --> 38:59.000
Those who will catch will be hurt themselves."

38:59.000 --> 39:02.481
So what is it, that Bhairava is to be established.

39:02.481 --> 39:09.201
Sidha kala mane Bhairav' - as you have to
establish Shri Ganesha, you have to establish

39:09.201 --> 39:11.960
also Bhairava, and Hanumana on the right side.

39:11.960 --> 39:17.891
If these three deities you establish within
yourself, nothing, nothing on this earth can

39:17.891 --> 39:18.891
catch you.

39:18.891 --> 39:22.451
You'll catch it for a while.

39:22.451 --> 39:26.160
But what I find now, I came to this ashram,
everybody's left Nabhi caught up.

39:26.160 --> 39:30.700
Everybody's left Agnya caught up.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.240
So then I get the pain.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.240
Everyone.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.101
I mean, I have put you inside My body, do
you know that?

39:36.101 --> 39:41.810
You are part and parcel of My body, you are
the cells in My body.

39:41.810 --> 39:50.690
And when you catch, I also catch; not catch,
but I really get the pain, but I clear it.

39:50.690 --> 39:53.621
In the same way, I have given you powers.

39:53.621 --> 40:01.141
Every power I have, I have given you.

40:01.141 --> 40:08.540
But you have to develop it and you have to
be adventurous.

40:08.540 --> 40:13.900
But on the contrary, once we have ashrams,
everybody settles down, "Oh, now, very comfortable,

40:13.900 --> 40:14.900
very cheap."

40:14.900 --> 40:18.081
Very economical, that's the first comfort.

40:18.081 --> 40:28.591
It's surprising, for a Western person, it
is very important that it should be economical,

40:28.591 --> 40:36.960
surprising, affluent people think more of
saving money than the people who are poor.

40:36.960 --> 40:46.210
And English are the last word, save pounds,
at the cost of others.

40:46.210 --> 40:49.891
On the contrary if you go to India, where
they’ll be very happy, they'll invite you

40:49.891 --> 40:51.131
in their house.

40:51.131 --> 40:54.730
Whatever they have they will give it to you,
"Eat, eat, eat."

40:54.730 --> 40:55.730
They'll force you.

40:55.730 --> 40:57.480
They'll be very happy to give.

40:57.480 --> 41:01.081
But in England it's very dangerous, you see.

41:01.081 --> 41:04.500
Sometimes in the ashram they may not even
have food for Me.

41:04.500 --> 41:06.190
Really.

41:06.190 --> 41:08.930
And if you tell them, "I know.

41:08.930 --> 41:09.930
I know."

41:09.930 --> 41:10.930
You know.

41:10.930 --> 41:11.930
Finished.

41:11.930 --> 41:12.930
Then what do you say?

41:12.930 --> 41:14.480
They already know it, now what to do?

41:14.480 --> 41:15.611
They know.

41:15.611 --> 41:23.780
So with the affluence miserliness grows, and
money-orientation.

41:23.780 --> 41:29.200
In India also I've seen people who get little
more money than the rest become very money-oriented.

41:29.200 --> 41:34.070
Money becomes everything, money becomes the
power, money becomes their life.

41:34.070 --> 41:37.871
Sahaja yogi doesn't care for money.

41:37.871 --> 41:42.960
Just.. is the dust of our Mother's feet.

41:42.960 --> 41:45.921
What is money, what is wealth?

41:45.921 --> 41:51.201
And when they do like that, then their money
problems are solved.

41:51.201 --> 41:54.150
If you have a money problem, know that there's
a problem.

41:54.150 --> 42:00.180
If you are very particular about money.

42:00.180 --> 42:04.800
I am, in a way, because if I have to give
somebody, I remember it.

42:04.800 --> 42:08.780
But I've seen people who are very anxious
to tell Me that, "You have to pay this man

42:08.780 --> 42:09.780
so much, that man so much."

42:09.780 --> 42:10.780
That's wrong.

42:10.780 --> 42:13.121
That's not your look-out.

42:13.121 --> 42:18.320
That's very, very wrong to tell Me that, "You
have to pay this man or that man."

42:18.320 --> 42:20.181
It's not important.

42:20.181 --> 42:23.930
Even if I don't pay, I pay him.

42:23.930 --> 42:29.851
So in relationship with Me, you are not to
tell Me that, "You have to pay so much money

42:29.851 --> 42:33.911
to him, this much money should be paid, this
is what he owes You."

42:33.911 --> 42:34.990
Nothing of the kind.

42:34.990 --> 42:37.510
Let the person come and tell Me.

42:37.510 --> 42:38.861
Why are you telling?

42:38.861 --> 42:43.520
That kind of a message if you give Me, you
are lost.

42:43.520 --> 42:48.911
Or if you come and tell Me for somebody else
that, "Mother, time is up, we have to go.

42:48.911 --> 42:51.160
Somebody is hurrying You up."

42:51.160 --> 42:57.520
If somebody is hurrying Me, tell him, "Don't
hurry Mother."

42:57.520 --> 43:09.550
You must know that your kundalinis were not
raised with just your own kundalini, but something

43:09.550 --> 43:11.320
that is working it out.

43:11.320 --> 43:16.181
Something very tremendous, a big organization.

43:16.181 --> 43:20.070
You can't see it, it is microscopic.

43:20.070 --> 43:24.250
You must know, nobody got realization like
that, did they?

43:24.250 --> 43:26.450
Thousands getting realization, what's happening?

43:26.450 --> 43:28.820
There must be something about…

43:28.820 --> 43:34.040
Now how can you tell anything to such an organization?

43:34.040 --> 43:35.040
They don't like it.

43:35.040 --> 43:36.460
They know it.

43:36.460 --> 43:40.471
Actually they are the ones who know, not the
English.

43:40.471 --> 43:43.470
They know what is to be done.

43:43.470 --> 43:50.300
So your relationship with Me acts as your
culture.

43:50.300 --> 43:56.750
So it is a Mother's cult, you can call it,
the Mother's culture.

43:56.750 --> 43:59.412
How we are connected with our Mother.

43:59.412 --> 44:06.210
I have seen people, if somebody is rude to
them, they get very angry.

44:06.210 --> 44:09.621
But if somebody is rude to Me they don't feel
angry.

44:09.621 --> 44:13.671
It should be the other way round.

44:13.671 --> 44:16.831
Now I'll give you an example.

44:16.831 --> 44:23.230
This Merv Griffin was funny, and both our
PRO’s were very angry.

44:23.230 --> 44:24.930
It was natural and very…

44:24.930 --> 44:28.070
I mean, I liked it, but I calmed them down.

44:28.070 --> 44:30.220
And Worlikar of course was on top of this
thing.

44:30.220 --> 44:33.191
But the other fellow would not.

44:33.191 --> 44:36.460
He was giving arguments.

44:36.460 --> 44:37.990
I was just watching.

44:37.990 --> 44:41.621
I mean, if somebody had said this to his mother...

44:41.621 --> 44:49.671
There's another one there, he never came to
receive Me at the airport.

44:49.671 --> 45:00.050
So Worlikar said, "If your own mother had
come, you would not have gone?"

45:00.050 --> 45:03.970
Then one can give explanation, "Oh, but our
Mother is Adi Shakti.

45:03.970 --> 45:06.190
My mother is not, she's helpless."

45:06.190 --> 45:07.190
It's not.

45:07.190 --> 45:12.331
To show your respect, to show your love, you
have to go; for your own gain, not for Her

45:12.331 --> 45:13.331
gain.

45:13.331 --> 45:17.000
For your own gain.

45:17.000 --> 45:20.641
This relationship is for your own gain.

45:20.641 --> 45:30.260
Supposing if you strike oil, is it for your
gain or for the gain of the oil?

45:30.260 --> 45:36.820
If you get to the Source, is it for the Source
to gain anything, or it is for you to gain

45:36.820 --> 45:37.820
anything?

45:37.820 --> 45:40.601
Logic, simple logic.

45:40.601 --> 45:49.760
So in that culture, you see, you really thrive
and you become extremely a happy person, a

45:49.760 --> 45:52.280
joyous person.

45:52.280 --> 46:01.621
And the expression of such a person is so
different, because such a person, as I told

46:01.621 --> 46:08.400
you, rises above and sees the problems of
others, the decadence of the society, sees

46:08.400 --> 46:13.710
all the problems of the world.

46:13.710 --> 46:17.451
Not only that, but knows the solutions.

46:17.451 --> 46:27.260
We are not like these ordinary people who
have racialism, this.. other diseases, I don't

46:27.260 --> 46:30.211
know what sort of diseases they have, I also
forget.

46:30.211 --> 46:32.941
Racialism now, it's another stupid nonsense,
you know.

46:32.941 --> 46:34.480
What is racialism?

46:34.480 --> 46:40.050
God has made somebody's color like this and
somebody's color like that, and those same

46:40.050 --> 46:51.601
racists are trying to tan their faces.

46:51.601 --> 46:58.530
So in this culture of ours we are not bothered
about superficial things.

46:58.530 --> 47:07.510
What we are bothered about is our inner cleanliness,
inner beauty, but that doesn't mean that you

47:07.510 --> 47:13.310
should move about like primitive people, no.

47:13.310 --> 47:16.331
But if there is inner beauty, then outer beauty
comes.

47:16.331 --> 47:18.910
You will never find Me dirtily dressed.

47:18.910 --> 47:24.530
You will never find Me without a sari on,
even when I sleep I wear a sari, because in

47:24.530 --> 47:35.611
the night also I have to work, so how can
I go in My dressing-gown to the other world?

47:35.611 --> 47:42.810
So a person who is a Sahaja yogi has to be
an extremely neat and a clean person, but

47:42.810 --> 47:46.440
not to tell others, but should be himself
or herself.

47:46.440 --> 47:51.220
That's one of the things are very important,
because others will see you, like loonies,

47:51.220 --> 47:53.570
who's going to believe you?

47:53.570 --> 47:59.780
So the one effect is from the Mother, you
take from the Source, for what?

47:59.780 --> 48:08.631
To be that illuminated quality, in you, so
that others see you as something great and

48:08.631 --> 48:12.680
adore you, worship you.

48:12.680 --> 48:17.770
This is this far we have come, now, how your
personality should be.

48:17.770 --> 48:23.710
But now, when you are dealing with others,
know that they are human beings made by God,

48:23.710 --> 48:28.800
not by Sahaja yogis by any chance.

48:28.800 --> 48:33.651
And they will be tomorrow's Sahaja yogis,
may be higher Sahaja yogis than you.

48:33.651 --> 48:40.500
So when we are dealing with others also, talk
to them in a gentle way.

48:40.500 --> 48:41.520
Be kind to them.

48:41.520 --> 48:45.391
Of course we are against gurus, against cults,
against all these people.

48:45.391 --> 48:52.930
But as soon as they come, if you say: "Oh,
you are a bhoot", the person will do right-about-turn

48:52.930 --> 48:56.820
and go away.

48:56.820 --> 49:07.601
So you are not given this power to be abrupt
or to be arrogant with others, not given.

49:07.601 --> 49:15.310
Now all such people are coming down, calming
down because they see that what helps is your

49:15.310 --> 49:20.081
gentle, kindly, firm attitude.

49:20.081 --> 49:23.060
Only after Sahaja Yoga you can combine all
these qualities.

49:23.060 --> 49:32.010
You'll be firm, you'll be alert, you'll be
gentle and compassionate, smiling, but not

49:32.010 --> 49:33.810
making fun of others.

49:33.810 --> 49:43.810
So then you become a personality who is alert:
to see what is the reaction they're having

49:43.810 --> 49:46.770
on others, this is very important to be seen.

49:46.770 --> 49:50.140
So now you start witnessing others.

49:50.140 --> 49:52.290
What is your reaction on others?

49:52.290 --> 49:57.910
I have seen many a times, a new Sahaja yogi
comes in.

49:57.910 --> 50:04.980
The person is trying to say something, and
the girl starts giggling or laughing.

50:04.980 --> 50:09.871
One should not, at that time, because the
person might think that, "They're making fool

50:09.871 --> 50:15.101
of me, or they're thinking that I'm a stupid
person, or something wrong with me."

50:15.101 --> 50:18.900
That person will become self-conscious, I
won't be able to give realization to that

50:18.900 --> 50:20.060
person.

50:20.060 --> 50:27.050
But if somebody is sitting before Me and I'm
trying to help that person, know that it's

50:27.050 --> 50:33.560
a very important moment of this gentleman's
life.

50:33.560 --> 50:35.621
We have got it, so what?

50:35.621 --> 50:42.710
When we are pulling out somebody, when we
are helping out somebody, do we laugh?

50:42.710 --> 50:51.621
That's the time you have to be very concerned
and very much serious, to do the job.

50:51.621 --> 50:57.030
Every quality and mood has its own place,
like nose is at its own place, eyes at its

50:57.030 --> 50:58.030
own place.

50:58.030 --> 51:07.730
In the same way, all these moods that we have,
have their own places.

51:07.730 --> 51:13.430
And that is what is lost in modern society.

51:13.430 --> 51:20.550
So when I am trying to help somebody, you
should be all concern about that person.

51:20.550 --> 51:24.230
How does this come in to us from the Source?

51:24.230 --> 51:27.361
How much you are concerned about Me?

51:27.361 --> 51:33.900
Supposing I am thirsty, you will feel thirsty.

51:33.900 --> 51:36.601
You'll immediately say, "Mother, I'll get
You some water."

51:36.601 --> 51:40.670
But you may not even ask Me, just bring it
here, keep it there.

51:40.670 --> 51:43.631
Or just make some tea for Me or look after
Me.

51:43.631 --> 51:47.040
Do this or do that.

51:47.040 --> 51:50.220
In little, little things you should watch.

51:50.220 --> 51:53.861
The concern is not in saying something, asking
something.

51:53.861 --> 51:55.331
You don't ask.

51:55.331 --> 52:04.700
Don't ask Mother, you just do it.

52:04.700 --> 52:09.060
That's how, when you start doing it, you will
understand what you are doing to others.

52:09.060 --> 52:16.852
So the reflection on others, how they reflect
about you also is very important, and you

52:16.852 --> 52:20.900
have to be alert.

52:20.900 --> 52:23.940
Suddenly you say something, and everybody
disappears.

52:23.940 --> 52:27.911
You must know they are not yet Sahaja yogis,
they are to be brought in, so you have to

52:27.911 --> 52:34.241
very carefully bring them around.

52:34.241 --> 52:41.260
Then with Sahaja yogis, among yourselves how
you behave is extremely important for others

52:41.260 --> 52:43.220
to see.

52:43.220 --> 52:51.111
We must cherish each other's company, we must
cherish.

52:51.111 --> 52:55.901
To meet some Sahaja yogi somewhere, "Ah, what
a joy it is to see someone, to talk to someone

52:55.901 --> 52:57.180
on the phone."

52:57.180 --> 53:04.351
But because we are so insular, so selfish,
so greedy, and sometimes very circumcised

53:04.351 --> 53:13.230
[should read 'circumscribed'] I should say,
or absolutely engulfed into our past, we cannot

53:13.230 --> 53:19.930
do that, we do not feel that joy, we cannot
adore another Sahaja yogi, we do not enjoy

53:19.930 --> 53:25.520
another Sahaja yogi, we cannot cherish his
company.

53:25.520 --> 53:30.290
That means this finger cannot feel this finger.

53:30.290 --> 53:35.241
It's like a developing, what you call, a disease
called leprosy.

53:35.241 --> 53:37.851
Nerves are finished.

53:37.851 --> 53:40.240
Nerve endings are not there.

53:40.240 --> 53:49.190
You cannot feel the joy of other Sahaja yogis.

53:49.190 --> 53:56.111
And this is only possible if you get over
your personal interests.

53:56.111 --> 54:04.310
When people come in Sahaja Yoga in the beginning,
they have personal interests, like say somebody

54:04.310 --> 54:11.540
is trying to sell something, so they would
like to sell it to Sahaja yogis.

54:11.540 --> 54:16.131
Or they are arranging something, they would
like Sahaja yogis to do it.

54:16.131 --> 54:20.081
See, personal interest, to use Sahaja yogis
for their own purposes.

54:20.081 --> 54:28.950
As a result of that I've seen some people
become so insular that nobody helps them,

54:28.950 --> 54:33.270
no work is done by them; if there's a telephone,
nobody will say, "I'll get it."

54:33.270 --> 54:36.060
That's American quality, they'll say, "I'll
get it."

54:36.060 --> 54:37.831
Is regarded good.

54:37.831 --> 54:44.500
Not in England, they'll be all sitting, quiet.

54:44.500 --> 54:49.690
Even when they have eaten the food, they have
to pay the money, they'll look this side,

54:49.690 --> 54:54.190
and some poor Indian student will pay for
all of them.

54:54.190 --> 54:55.730
"I won't look", they say.

54:55.730 --> 54:56.730
"Now paid."

54:56.730 --> 54:58.010
Now they are normal.

54:58.010 --> 55:02.200
It's very low-level.

55:02.200 --> 55:07.800
Is extremely low-level behavior.

55:07.800 --> 55:19.510
And this is what one has to learn, that you
have to cherish others, give presents to others.

55:19.510 --> 55:28.500
"You're going there; “Oh, now…"; like
the other day I met a lady, she had liked

55:28.500 --> 55:33.210
one of My rings of emerald.

55:33.210 --> 55:39.670
That's My family ring so I can't give away,
you see, I'll have to ask C.P. and he may

55:39.670 --> 55:44.550
not like it, because after all I have no right
on it, I have to give it to My children, all

55:44.550 --> 55:45.550
right?

55:45.550 --> 55:49.640
But I found an emerald somewhere, beautiful,
so I kept it with Me.

55:49.640 --> 55:51.800
The other day when I gave her, she was so
enamored.

55:51.800 --> 55:55.630
I said, "You liked My ring, I couldn't give
you My ring, so.."

55:55.630 --> 55:59.150
She said to Me, "You mean to say, I would
have taken Your ring?"

55:59.150 --> 56:03.460
I said, "I would have forced it on you, but
I couldn't give you, so I thought of it.

56:03.460 --> 56:06.331
I just saw it somewhere so I got it for you."

56:06.331 --> 56:07.331
She said, "How thoughtful."

56:07.331 --> 56:10.660
But it's all in My head.

56:10.660 --> 56:20.170
I, whenever I get it, a chance, you see, so
somebody says, "Oh, I like it", keep it in

56:20.170 --> 56:21.170
mind.

56:21.170 --> 56:24.160
Next time, even a flower.

56:24.160 --> 56:29.050
You must cherish their companies, because
it's such a great thing to have somebody who

56:29.050 --> 56:32.341
understands you, your spirit, and they have
the spirit.

56:32.341 --> 56:34.081
Such a great thing.

56:34.081 --> 56:39.280
How can you be unkind to each other?

56:39.280 --> 56:41.460
That hurts Me the most of all.

56:41.460 --> 56:50.941
And the first thing and the foremost thing
you have to give Me is congenial, beautiful,

56:50.941 --> 56:59.331
loving group, that they love each other.

56:59.331 --> 57:03.650
If that's achieved, that you really love,
beyond your personal considerations.

57:03.650 --> 57:11.180
I mean, of course, in Sahaja Yoga there are
now not many people who try to make money,

57:11.180 --> 57:13.310
but try to make comfort for themselves.

57:13.310 --> 57:16.770
They must have the best room, they must have
the best place, they must have...

57:16.770 --> 57:19.871
"I didn't get this, I should have it, this,
that."

57:19.871 --> 57:21.240
Try to do more than others.

57:21.240 --> 57:27.431
I know sometimes people take advantage of
you, but they will go out of Sahaja Yoga very

57:27.431 --> 57:28.431
soon.

57:28.431 --> 57:32.871
So be sure that you become generous about
it, very generous.

57:32.871 --> 57:44.331
And generosity should start from your own
Sahaja yogi brothers and sisters.

57:44.331 --> 57:53.680
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have
a full imbibement bubbling through our nerves,

57:53.680 --> 57:57.581
the sense of chastity.

57:57.581 --> 58:03.250
That is a must, whether you like it or not.

58:03.250 --> 58:15.091
There should be no bad intentions about any
other person, of relationships which are not

58:15.091 --> 58:16.091
pure.

58:16.091 --> 58:28.510
Absolutely pure relationships, pure eyes without
any adultery, adulteration I would call it.

58:28.510 --> 58:38.091
Clean eyes is the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

58:38.091 --> 58:44.940
Steadfast clean eyes, because your eyes are
very powerful.

58:44.940 --> 58:50.440
You don't know how powerful they are.

58:50.440 --> 59:02.121
So to make it that way, to practice, move
your attention inward and towards the Sahasrara.

59:02.121 --> 59:03.121
You can.

59:03.121 --> 59:07.670
With your eyes you suck in.

59:07.670 --> 59:15.000
Even by looking at Me with the shraddha, with
the joy, you just suck it inside, My image.

59:15.000 --> 59:22.871
Put it on your Sahasrara, put it in your heart,
you can do it.

59:22.871 --> 59:25.170
It's very joy giving.

59:25.170 --> 59:30.960
When you put it in the Sahasrara, then you
get the knowledge.

59:30.960 --> 59:38.150
When you put it in your heart, you get the
joy; and when you put it on your liver, then

59:38.150 --> 59:43.500
you get the power of action.

59:43.500 --> 59:49.740
From the photograph also you can do it, suck
in, move it.

59:49.740 --> 01:00:00.700
But that is shown in the way you behave towards
others, completely confident, gentle; no arrogance.

01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:13.420
Neither the neck up like that or like that,
but in the center in a very dignified manner.

01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:27.770
So in the culture of Sahaj, because the spirit
is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:31.470
of God, you have to judge yourself.

01:00:31.470 --> 01:00:37.780
"Did I say something which is not respecting
my spirit?

01:00:37.780 --> 01:00:44.660
Did I do something that is not glorious?"

01:00:44.660 --> 01:00:48.940
Like I've seen people, when I'm there, they'll
go on asking Me hundred questions.

01:00:48.940 --> 01:00:50.980
"Should it be white towel?

01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:51.980
Green towel?

01:00:51.980 --> 01:00:56.790
Should I do this, should I do that?"

01:00:56.790 --> 01:00:58.190
Why?

01:00:58.190 --> 01:01:00.430
Because we don't live with choices.

01:01:00.430 --> 01:01:05.490
We live with whatever we get it, and there
is dignity in that.

01:01:05.490 --> 01:01:11.920
If you start doing choices, it's stupid.

01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:16.671
In a group of Sahaja yogis, the food, "What
will you have?"

01:01:16.671 --> 01:01:20.790
They'll take forty-five minutes to decide,
if you go in a restaurant, because the first,

01:01:20.790 --> 01:01:25.570
the consciousness, "We are paying for it",
and somebody will have this, somebody will

01:01:25.570 --> 01:01:26.570
have that.

01:01:26.570 --> 01:01:28.910
The poor waiter will run away.

01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:32.081
But why should we have different?

01:01:32.081 --> 01:01:36.391
It's just the same.

01:01:36.391 --> 01:01:43.800
Whatever Mother is having we'll have, finished.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:47.150
But if not that, at least whatever everybody
is having, "Why have separately?"

01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:51.601
Choices are not there in Sahaja Yoga, remember
this word very clearly.

01:01:51.601 --> 01:01:55.351
Choices of this, choices of that, I don't
like it, I like that.

01:01:55.351 --> 01:02:00.121
This is not good, that is not good.

01:02:00.121 --> 01:02:08.240
Because we need everything on the level of
vibrations, then the choice is coming.

01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:18.000
Like, if the vibrations are not good we'll
not say it, but we'll not have it.

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.010
But not question of whether green or red or
yellow or white.

01:02:23.010 --> 01:02:26.891
And that is what they are making fool out
of you.

01:02:26.891 --> 01:02:32.530
They will put one name, Cartier, finished.

01:02:32.530 --> 01:02:36.060
People will pay any amount for that Cartier.

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:41.410
Is any ordinary stuff, it is nothing special.

01:02:41.410 --> 01:02:43.510
But you see that ego, "I've got the Cartier.

01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:48.780
I paid more to show that I've paid more, that
I've been a fool."

01:02:48.780 --> 01:02:56.910
To pay more for something that's so cheapish;
that's what they're playing upon - remember

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:57.910
that.

01:02:57.910 --> 01:03:06.040
So you have to understand that when you are
a Sahaj personality, you have your own dignity.

01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:09.431
These things do not give dignity to you.

01:03:09.431 --> 01:03:15.871
You give them dignity.

01:03:15.871 --> 01:03:24.820
But that doesn't mean tomorrow you come like
a clown, or like a limbo on your nose.

01:03:24.820 --> 01:03:30.341
Of course I must see the other point always,
because it just slips out that side.

01:03:30.341 --> 01:03:37.701
When you become dignified, you will wear always
something that is dignified.

01:03:37.701 --> 01:03:39.490
You will do all that is dignified.

01:03:39.490 --> 01:03:42.151
Is automatically you become dignified.

01:03:42.151 --> 01:03:45.540
It's nothing artificial.

01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:53.160
So dignity that comes, as you see your Mother.

01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:59.490
Whatever you give Me in Puja I take it, all
right, but otherwise you cannot give Me anything

01:03:59.490 --> 01:04:00.490
else.

01:04:00.490 --> 01:04:06.730
If you give Me, I'll return it, somehow.

01:04:06.730 --> 01:04:09.940
Somehow I'll return it.

01:04:09.940 --> 01:04:16.371
A person who is money-oriented cannot have
dignity, because you see him like a beggar.

01:04:16.371 --> 01:04:19.491
See, if there’s money-orientation is too
much, he comes down to that level, you can

01:04:19.491 --> 01:04:21.961
see it, there cannot be dignity there.

01:04:21.961 --> 01:04:26.460
A man who is power-oriented is an idiot.

01:04:26.460 --> 01:04:29.151
He looks like an idiot.

01:04:29.151 --> 01:04:30.620
So we cannot become idiots.

01:04:30.620 --> 01:04:31.620
All right.

01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.230
So we cannot be power-oriented.

01:04:34.230 --> 01:04:42.421
The one who is sort of a romantic or a love-oriented,
is a stupid fellow.

01:04:42.421 --> 01:04:44.710
He behaves like a stupid fellow.

01:04:44.710 --> 01:04:48.050
On the street they go on kissing each other
all the time.

01:04:48.050 --> 01:04:49.611
"Where are you going?"

01:04:49.611 --> 01:04:56.530
"To the divorce case, but last bit we are
thinking of having some kisses."

01:04:56.530 --> 01:05:00.421
Self-respect is the thing.

01:05:00.421 --> 01:05:01.820
Self is your spirit.

01:05:01.820 --> 01:05:05.040
The respect of the spirit should give you
that dignity.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:11.160
But in privacy you are gentle with your husband,
you are gentle with your wife.

01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:18.400
You must learn how to be gentle with her in
privacy, not in public.

01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.120
That's horrible.

01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.280
Specially in India.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:25.101
I am told that people go round with that romanticism
and all that.

01:05:25.101 --> 01:05:31.440
So please, don't do all those romantic stuff
in India, it's very embarrassing for Me, very

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:32.591
embarrassing.

01:05:32.591 --> 01:05:37.591
So we cannot do things which embarrasses our
Mother.

01:05:37.591 --> 01:05:42.370
Once you start knowing that, "This will embarrass
Mother, we can't do this", automatically you

01:05:42.370 --> 01:05:43.370
are helping.

01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:49.851
So when it is related with Me, immediately,
"What will Mother think of in me?

01:05:49.851 --> 01:05:51.970
Is this the way to behave towards Mother?"

01:05:51.970 --> 01:06:03.720
Immediately you will get the reward, as that
thing working through you, as if you become

01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:04.841
that nature.

01:06:04.841 --> 01:06:08.240
Sahaja culture is a sahaja nature.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.390
Automatically you will do it.

01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:18.361
You'll talk in that manner, you will speak
in that manner, you’ll live in that manner.

01:06:18.361 --> 01:06:24.641
I mean, I have seen people who have never
known Me, on a trunk call or a telephone,

01:06:24.641 --> 01:06:25.841
they recognize.

01:06:25.841 --> 01:06:30.670
They know I am something special; if they
are sensitive enough.

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:35.210
From My photograph, the way I sit, the way
I talk, immediately everyone asks.

01:06:35.210 --> 01:06:39.040
The other day where I went for the meeting
with My husband, everybody was asking, "Who

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.040
is this lady?"

01:06:40.040 --> 01:06:41.040
"Who is this lady?"

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:45.111
"Who is this lady?"

01:06:45.111 --> 01:06:46.460
There's something in the personality.

01:06:46.460 --> 01:06:53.181
I talk to everyone nicely, I'm very sweet.

01:06:53.181 --> 01:06:56.760
We cannot be slavish, and we cannot enslave
anyone.

01:06:56.760 --> 01:07:04.731
We have to cherish, even human beings we have
to cherish, because they are us.

01:07:04.731 --> 01:07:10.591
Not to despise anyone, not to laugh at anyone.

01:07:10.591 --> 01:07:17.171
In the culture of Sahaj, you have to become
an expert: expertise.

01:07:17.171 --> 01:07:25.050
Expertise comes through your adherence to
your Mother.

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:29.730
Expertise: you all should be an expert, and
who will give you the certificate is your

01:07:29.730 --> 01:07:32.260
Mother only - who else?

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:41.331
I may not say so, but your spirit will say
that, and not your ego.

01:07:41.331 --> 01:07:47.609
In this short time whatever was possible,
it's such a big subject, culture is; you cannot.

01:07:47.609 --> 01:07:54.399
But I've talked to you, I would not say in
a very analytical way, but in a very synthetic

01:07:54.399 --> 01:07:56.569
manner.

01:07:56.569 --> 01:07:59.370
So I've given you very synthesis of the whole
thing.

01:07:59.371 --> 01:08:06.230
"Analytical" would be one, two, three, four,
five - cut short - two, three, four, five,

01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:07.260
like that.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.340
It's not like that.

01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:11.701
And that is how you have to speak to people.

01:08:11.701 --> 01:08:16.649
One, this is so; two, this is so; three, this
is so; finished.

01:08:16.649 --> 01:08:18.549
You are not Sahaja yogis.

01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:25.680
In your speeches if you talk like that, finished.

01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:31.749
But before saying something or doing something,
give a little idea where you are leading the

01:08:31.750 --> 01:08:38.029
people, so they are not frittered away, attention
is not frittered away.

01:08:38.029 --> 01:08:49.919
Give a little idea, as I say, or else while
talking, bring them to a point which is important,

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.801
so that they wait in the sentence to come
to that point.

01:08:55.801 --> 01:09:02.460
But make the whole sentence look so, that
it is going towards certain points, so always

01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:11.951
a Sahaja yogi must make a point out of what
they talk, not just babbling, talking.

01:09:11.951 --> 01:09:15.940
What is the point you are going to make?

01:09:15.940 --> 01:09:21.451
Whatever they do, they have to know, "What
are we going to achieve out of it?"

01:09:21.451 --> 01:09:22.630
Now, marriage.

01:09:22.630 --> 01:09:25.320
"What are we going to achieve out of marriage?"

01:09:25.320 --> 01:09:29.161
A family, house, everybody has, even a donkey
has that.

01:09:29.161 --> 01:09:31.300
What's so great?

01:09:31.300 --> 01:09:37.021
We are going to achieve a family unit where
realized souls are to be born, we're going

01:09:37.021 --> 01:09:48.791
to look after them in a proper way, and then
we are going to emit that unit into this world,

01:09:48.791 --> 01:09:56.630
like a sparkling diamond set in the beautiful
setting of a family, giving light to the whole

01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:59.670
world.

01:09:59.670 --> 01:10:09.931
So one's life should not be pointless, and
talk should not be pointless, and every moment

01:10:09.931 --> 01:10:20.820
should be filled with achievements of your
visions and dreams, slowly and steadily, which

01:10:20.820 --> 01:10:26.661
is not at all difficult.

01:10:26.661 --> 01:10:32.920
If you can get rid of ego and superego, finished,
that's all - simple as that.

01:10:32.920 --> 01:10:43.021
May God bless you all.

01:10:43.021 --> 01:10:53.110
Mm.. good.. nice.. relaxed, eh?

01:10:53.110 --> 01:10:55.130
Relaxed.

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:57.150
Witness.

01:10:57.150 --> 01:11:06.701
Everyone cleared out, I think.

01:11:06.701 --> 01:11:12.951
And no more… one more thing I must say last,
as I've said it before, which I've not said

01:11:12.951 --> 01:11:18.351
here, no-one is going to say that bhoot did
it, because such a person will be sent away

01:11:18.351 --> 01:11:22.481
to the bhoot clan, not to Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:22.481 --> 01:11:27.440
Don't put your responsibility on the bhoots.

01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:32.311
Either you are a bhoot or you are a Sahaja
yogi, one of the two, you can't be both.
