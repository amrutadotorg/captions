Birthday Puja
March 21, 1996
New Delhi, India

00:09:59.092 --> 00:10:04.756
Today, I'm going to talk about the mind.

00:10:05.092 --> 00:10:09.047
People don't know what is this mind is.

00:10:09.248 --> 00:10:13.094
It is very easy to understand for Sahaja Yogis

00:10:13.295 --> 00:10:19.407
that we are the ones who react,

00:10:19.608 --> 00:10:25.272
react to everything that is outside.

00:10:26.475 --> 00:10:32.133
The reason is we have two horrible tendencies,

00:10:32.334 --> 00:10:35.664
one which is an ego,

00:10:35.865 --> 00:10:40.922
and another tendency is that

00:10:41.123 --> 00:10:47.070
we are being trained that way,

00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:51.406
or we can call it the superego or the conditionings.

00:10:51.607 --> 00:10:55.578
So, both the things, our ego and conditionings,

00:10:55.779 --> 00:10:59.328
are all the time acting outside.

00:10:59.529 --> 00:11:02.957
This reaction, which is built-in within us,

00:11:03.158 --> 00:11:08.004
is just like bubbles in the ocean.

00:11:08.205 --> 00:11:13.668
And these bubbles keep us away from reality.

00:11:13.869 --> 00:11:16.051
These bubbles are of thoughts,

00:11:16.252 --> 00:11:20.153
and they just blast you all the time in your head,

00:11:20.354 --> 00:11:22.989
and you don't know why they are coming.

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:27.630
When you depend on this artificial mind of yours

00:11:27.831 --> 00:11:30.068
then you have no discretion

00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:34.662
as to understand what is good and what is bad.

00:11:34.863 --> 00:11:40.607
This mind is the one where all kinds of evil things start,

00:11:40.808 --> 00:11:46.380
all kinds of quarrels, fights and possessiveness,

00:11:46.581 --> 00:11:49.497
lastly the war also comes there.

00:11:49.698 --> 00:11:55.989
It is in this mind only, which is nothing but a myth,

00:11:56.190 --> 00:12:01.677
all these concrete, destructive ideas,

00:12:01.878 --> 00:12:05.474
somehow or other come up,

00:12:05.675 --> 00:12:09.560
and then they start growing and growing.

00:12:09.761 --> 00:12:13.826
Then you find people whom you can impress also,

00:12:14.027 --> 00:12:19.006
put ideas into their heads - by reading,

00:12:19.207 --> 00:12:22.569
they learn, or by their lectures, or by mesmerism,

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:24.882
whatever kinds of things they can do.

00:12:25.083 --> 00:12:27.866
They put your mind into such a frame

00:12:28.067 --> 00:12:32.936
that you accept these destructive ideas,

00:12:33.137 --> 00:12:37.842
for yourself individually, or maybe for the collective.

00:12:38.043 --> 00:12:40.858
So this mind is just a myth

00:12:41.059 --> 00:12:44.983
and we are working through this mind.

00:12:45.184 --> 00:12:48.850
We are all the time satisfying ourselves by saying,

00:12:49.051 --> 00:12:53.459
“Oh, that's my mind, my mind wants it.”

00:12:53.660 --> 00:13:00.764
You see, like one Indian Sahaja Yogi went to America,

00:13:00.988 --> 00:13:04.201
and he told Me that, “Americans are maneuvering.”

00:13:04.402 --> 00:13:07.670
Maneuver means they are mad after their mind.

00:13:07.871 --> 00:13:09.871
I said, “What do you mean?” He said,

00:13:10.072 --> 00:13:14.551
“I gave money to my wife to buy one bush shirt for me.

00:13:14.752 --> 00:13:17.504
She went and bought some skirts.

00:13:17.705 --> 00:13:21.051
And she has many skirts, but she bought some skirts.

00:13:21.252 --> 00:13:23.965
So I asked her, 'Why did you buy the skirts?'

00:13:24.166 --> 00:13:26.824
So she said, 'My mind said that,

00:13:27.025 --> 00:13:30.254
"you should buy the skirts", so I bought skirts’.”

00:13:30.455 --> 00:13:34.257
So, this is what it is, that the mind

00:13:34.458 --> 00:13:37.171
can take you to all kinds of wrong things

00:13:37.372 --> 00:13:40.788
because it has no connection with reality, firstly,

00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:47.382
and secondly it is a mythical thing,

00:13:47.583 --> 00:13:50.741
absolutely mythical.

00:13:50.942 --> 00:13:53.633
You see, people think that whatever they have created,

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:58.992
it is out of their mind. Is a wrong idea, absolutely wrong idea.

00:13:59.193 --> 00:14:02.931
All great scientists, say - Einstein has said that,

00:14:03.132 --> 00:14:09.611
“I was tired trying to find out the Theory of Relativity,

00:14:09.812 --> 00:14:12.944
very tired.” He had some concept,

00:14:13.145 --> 00:14:15.960
like all scientists take up some sort of a concept,

00:14:16.161 --> 00:14:18.944
and they tried to build up their research on that,

00:14:19.145 --> 00:14:23.921
“And then I thought, it’s a wrong concept that I have taken up.

00:14:24.122 --> 00:14:26.921
Suddenly”, he said, “I went into the garden,

00:14:27.122 --> 00:14:31.843
I said let’s try and play with the soap bubbles.”

00:14:32.044 --> 00:14:34.960
He was playing with the soap bubbles like a small child,

00:14:35.161 --> 00:14:40.312
“and suddenly, from somewhere unknown”, he says,

00:14:40.513 --> 00:14:45.765
the Theory of Relativity dawned upon him.

00:14:45.966 --> 00:14:47.966
Many scientists have said that -

00:14:48.167 --> 00:14:51.974
that they don't know from where they get this idea.

00:14:52.175 --> 00:14:56.747
From where did they get it? It has a special study now

00:14:56.948 --> 00:14:58.948
people are doing to find out

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:02.011
how these scientists got these things.

00:15:02.212 --> 00:15:04.753
And in a very Sahaj manner,

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:08.058
even the way penicillin was discovered,

00:15:08.259 --> 00:15:11.206
or anything was discovered by these people,

00:15:11.407 --> 00:15:15.839
was not through the probing or manipulation of the mind,

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:20.206
but through some unknown force it came into their mind,

00:15:20.407 --> 00:15:22.996
and that's what they thought, that

00:15:23.197 --> 00:15:25.980
this was from their mind, some, some.

00:15:26.181 --> 00:15:28.683
But most of them realized, even Newton realized

00:15:28.884 --> 00:15:31.691
that, “It is coming from something,

00:15:31.892 --> 00:15:34.347
some source which I am not aware of.”

00:15:34.548 --> 00:15:39.769
As Sahaja Yogis you know it is the Source of the Divine Power,

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.933
which is all-pervading, the Paramchaitanya.

00:15:44.134 --> 00:15:47.472
You know, because you can feel it, you know it is there.

00:15:47.673 --> 00:15:51.699
But, even when you know, you must know you have to go

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:56.199
beyond your mind into thoughtless awareness, minimum.

00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:58.707
Always I tell you, “Meditate, meditate”,

00:15:58.908 --> 00:16:01.879
because you should be in thoughtless awareness,

00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.879
where you do not react.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.332
So, what happens, you become a witness,

00:16:07.533 --> 00:16:11.175
you become the witness of the whole drama, of the whole scene,

00:16:11.376 --> 00:16:16.027
and you are absolutely at ease with yourself, no problem.

00:16:16.228 --> 00:16:19.738
And what you are doing that you become an instrument

00:16:19.939 --> 00:16:23.105
of this Paramachaitanya, of this all-pervading power.

00:16:23.306 --> 00:16:25.660
You are just watching, you are a witness,

00:16:25.861 --> 00:16:28.426
and as watching everything,

00:16:28.627 --> 00:16:34.754
you realize that whatever you watch cannot react on you.

00:16:34.955 --> 00:16:37.481
But you know what it is,

00:16:37.682 --> 00:16:41.387
and this is what is the state in which you understand

00:16:41.588 --> 00:16:44.840
the reality of the whole situation.

00:16:45.041 --> 00:16:49.242
I've told you many a times that,
if you are standing in the water

00:16:49.443 --> 00:16:57.241
you are afraid that the waves will - might kill you.

00:16:57.442 --> 00:17:00.921
But supposing you get into a boat,

00:17:01.122 --> 00:17:09.253
then you can watch those waves as something beautiful, maybe.

00:17:09.454 --> 00:17:12.792
If you learn how to swim, you can jump

00:17:12.993 --> 00:17:16.823
and bring back people who are getting drowned.

00:17:17.024 --> 00:17:22.855
This is exactly what happens when you are

00:17:23.056 --> 00:17:28.855
in that state that you can give Realizations to others.

00:17:29.056 --> 00:17:33.824
You can put them in connection with the Divine Power.

00:17:34.025 --> 00:17:39.910
But first of all you must know how to become

00:17:40.111 --> 00:17:43.098
thoughtlessly aware. Some people say,

00:17:43.299 --> 00:17:47.418
“Mother, for a second only we become, for two seconds we become”,

00:17:47.619 --> 00:17:52.517
because, you see, in our mind,
even if you come to Sahaja Yog,

00:17:52.718 --> 00:17:55.800
you have so many conditionings to begin with.

00:17:56.001 --> 00:17:59.066
First of all, if you are born an Indian

00:17:59.267 --> 00:18:01.933
then you are identified with India.

00:18:02.134 --> 00:18:05.589
If you are born in England, you are identified with England.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.166
One thing I've noticed about Sahaja Yogis,

00:18:08.367 --> 00:18:12.908
once they get out of this nonsense of this mind,

00:18:13.109 --> 00:18:15.109
first thing they start criticizing

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:21.187
the way they have been living in atmosphere,

00:18:21.388 --> 00:18:23.678
for example they’ll say, “Ah, this is Indian,

00:18:23.879 --> 00:18:28.186
now, this is what the Indians are.” Then you'll say, “This is”,

00:18:28.387 --> 00:18:31.788
if they are British, they'll say, “These are the British, you see.”

00:18:31.989 --> 00:18:34.468
They will be the best to criticize.

00:18:34.669 --> 00:18:37.398
Even others cannot criticize as they criticize,

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:41.801
for example, Europeans will criticize Europeans, saying that,

00:18:42.002 --> 00:18:46.433
“Ah – Europeans, all right, I know Europeans very well”, like that.

00:18:46.634 --> 00:18:51.261
The mind itself, you see, starts seeing, then,

00:18:51.462 --> 00:18:56.379
what you can say, that mind itself sees that it's a myth.

00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:59.660
And then the cheating that takes place all the time,

00:18:59.861 --> 00:19:04.715
that the intelligence that cheats itself, stops.

00:19:04.916 --> 00:19:11.770
You start seeing the thing in a proper, full manner,

00:19:11.971 --> 00:19:14.590
because you don't react.

00:19:14.791 --> 00:19:22.103
To react is a sign of a person who is very conditioned.

00:19:22.468 --> 00:19:24.623
You can be conditioned by many other things, like

00:19:24.824 --> 00:19:26.824
you are born in a particular religion.

00:19:27.025 --> 00:19:30.014
Now, as you know, what has religion to do nowadays

00:19:30.215 --> 00:19:34.811
with human beings? There's no real religion anywhere,

00:19:35.012 --> 00:19:37.983
it has become like a money-orientation,

00:19:38.184 --> 00:19:41.858
or you can say, power orientation.

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:44.178
That's why they are all fighting among themselves,

00:19:44.379 --> 00:19:48.764
and you know for definite that no religion is exclusive.

00:19:48.965 --> 00:19:53.342
But they fight. The reason is, the mind is conditioned

00:19:53.543 --> 00:19:56.045
that, 'you must fight for your religion'.

00:19:56.246 --> 00:19:59.006
Now, they have no religion within;

00:19:59.207 --> 00:20:02.951
there's no religion that is working out in their lives.

00:20:03.152 --> 00:20:09.029
They might be the most corrupt, most immoral people,

00:20:09.230 --> 00:20:13.474
but they belong to a particular religion, like a club.

00:20:13.675 --> 00:20:19.146
And then they start, you see, identifying themselves as something,

00:20:19.347 --> 00:20:21.787
and they have a right to do these things,

00:20:21.988 --> 00:20:25.935
because they belong to a particular religion or to cult,

00:20:26.136 --> 00:20:28.136
and this and that.

00:20:28.511 --> 00:20:33.208
Now, there are people who can really use this mind,

00:20:33.409 --> 00:20:35.416
though it is artificial.

00:20:35.617 --> 00:20:38.700
In modern times, we are using so many artificial things

00:20:38.901 --> 00:20:43.739
and this artificiality can creep into everything, like plastic.

00:20:43.940 --> 00:20:47.575
So, this mind can penetrate into anything

00:20:47.776 --> 00:20:50.247
and it penetrates into the minds of people.

00:20:50.448 --> 00:20:55.536
That's how Hitler managed all the young people of Germany.

00:20:55.737 --> 00:21:01.169
All these people who have been able to destroy.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:09.055
The reasoning which is logical, not through the mind.

00:21:09.256 --> 00:21:12.899
If it is through the mind it's no logic.

00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:20.389
It is just a reasoning that we can see clearly stupidity.

00:21:21.319 --> 00:21:27.720
Because this mind, which is just a bubble, as I told you,

00:21:27.921 --> 00:21:33.158
and is so limited, that it cannot comprehend

00:21:33.359 --> 00:21:39.187
the beauty, the glory, the expanse of reality.

00:21:40.062 --> 00:21:44.924
This mind is just a collection of all the garbage, we should say,

00:21:45.125 --> 00:21:48.682
which we have to, somehow or other, deny

00:21:48.883 --> 00:21:53.471
and tell ourselves that, “I have to go beyond my mind.

00:21:53.672 --> 00:21:59.375
So-called mind of mine has done no good for me.

00:22:03.641 --> 00:22:11.478
And this mind of mine, which has been all the time controlling me,

00:22:11.679 --> 00:22:15.239
is just like the watch we have made and it is controlling us,

00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:19.713
or like the computer that controls us.”

00:22:20.479 --> 00:22:23.059
So we have to be careful

00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:25.895
that we are the ones who have created this mind,

00:22:26.096 --> 00:22:30.408
and this mind has no business to control us.

00:22:30.955 --> 00:22:33.902
Many people try to control the mind.

00:22:34.103 --> 00:22:37.988
There's a way of doing it that, “I’ll control my mind now.”

00:22:38.189 --> 00:22:41.808
Now, try to understand, how will you control the mind?

00:22:42.009 --> 00:22:44.292
Only through mind.

00:22:44.493 --> 00:22:47.159
Either by ego or by your conditioning.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:50.948
You have no means of controlling your mind,

00:22:51.149 --> 00:22:54.886
because it is the mind which you have created,

00:22:55.087 --> 00:23:00.215
and that is just existing there, which you cannot control,

00:23:00.416 --> 00:23:04.462
though you might think, 'I can control.'

00:23:05.986 --> 00:23:11.808
You have to go beyond this mind.
And to go beyond this mind

00:23:12.009 --> 00:23:17.355
the most helpful thing is Kundalini awakening.

00:23:17.556 --> 00:23:20.457
Because She passes through your limbic area,

00:23:20.658 --> 00:23:25.168
pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:23:25.369 --> 00:23:33.074
and just takes you away, out into the realm of reality

00:23:33.275 --> 00:23:41.738
and the Yoga takes place between your brain, I should say,

00:23:41.939 --> 00:23:45.918
your heart, with this All-pervading Power.

00:23:46.119 --> 00:23:50.316
She's the one which connects, She's the one who does it.

00:23:50.517 --> 00:23:53.277
Many people are doing Sahaja Yog, I know that,

00:23:53.478 --> 00:23:58.691
but it's difficult for them, sometimes to get to meditation,

00:23:58.892 --> 00:24:02.746
to establish this thoughtless awareness,

00:24:02.947 --> 00:24:07.230
which is an extremely important state

00:24:07.431 --> 00:24:10.316
which you all should achieve.

00:24:10.517 --> 00:24:14.339
So many Sahaja Yogis are there, and I'm happy to know that

00:24:14.540 --> 00:24:16.540
they are getting deeper and deeper,

00:24:16.741 --> 00:24:21.009
but as long as they are in the turmoil of their mind

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:23.743
they cannot progress.

00:24:23.944 --> 00:24:31.243
Whatever is created out of their mind has no reality in it,

00:24:31.444 --> 00:24:39.220
is very limited, and is also, sometimes very repulsive,

00:24:39.421 --> 00:24:41.421
because with this mind people start thinking,

00:24:41.622 --> 00:24:43.622
“I am such and such”, you know.

00:24:43.823 --> 00:24:46.673
Now you become, supposing, I don't know what, position,

00:24:46.874 --> 00:24:50.939
but supposing you become the Governor,

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:53.140
then you think you can do what you like,

00:24:53.341 --> 00:24:55.044
because you have become the Governor.

00:24:55.245 --> 00:24:58.169
This mind doesn't know that you have become the Governor,

00:24:58.370 --> 00:25:00.825
you are not the Governor.

00:25:01.026 --> 00:25:03.026
This governorship is ruling you,

00:25:03.227 --> 00:25:06.323
not that you are ruling the governorship.

00:25:06.524 --> 00:25:09.776
Once these ideas come into your head,

00:25:09.977 --> 00:25:13.893
you start behaving in a manner in which you should not behave.

00:25:14.094 --> 00:25:17.198
Even among Sahaja Yogis there are leaders.

00:25:17.399 --> 00:25:20.628
Leaders also start sometimes thinking, 'Ah, I'm a leader'.

00:25:20.829 --> 00:25:22.829
It's a myth, absolute myth,

00:25:23.030 --> 00:25:25.392
leadership in Sahaja Yoga is an absolute myth,

00:25:25.593 --> 00:25:29.150
which you should know. But once they know they are leaders, see,

00:25:29.351 --> 00:25:38.605
they become, sort of absolutely mindful

00:25:38.806 --> 00:25:41.449
and full of thoughts.

00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:49.235
Thoughts how to dominate, how to control.

00:25:49.436 --> 00:25:53.454
When they start controlling others, then you must know that

00:25:53.655 --> 00:25:57.251
it is the mind which is telling them to control.

00:25:57.452 --> 00:26:01.079
Why to control anyone? If you are a real Sahaja Yogi,

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.258
there is no need to control.

00:26:04.459 --> 00:26:07.539
There is no need to maneuver, to manipulate.

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.469
Now, once your attention goes beyond the mind,

00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:18.508
only the Sahaj Yogis will understand this point very clearly,

00:26:18.709 --> 00:26:23.360
when this mind goes beyond the thoughts

00:26:23.561 --> 00:26:29.904
then the manipulation of the attention is very important.

00:26:30.475 --> 00:26:33.180
Then whatever you manipulate,

00:26:33.381 --> 00:26:38.857
means you take this attention to this or to that or to that.

00:26:39.225 --> 00:26:42.712
You’ll be surprised how dynamic you become,

00:26:42.913 --> 00:26:48.811
how effective you become, and how knowledgeable you become.

00:26:49.202 --> 00:26:51.462
Because, once

00:26:51.663 --> 00:26:56.251
you can take this attention to anything you want,

00:26:56.452 --> 00:27:00.331
immediately there is light on that issue, on that person,

00:27:00.532 --> 00:27:02.831
on that problem,

00:27:03.032 --> 00:27:09.214
and you see how it works out, how it helps.

00:27:09.415 --> 00:27:11.415
In Sahaja Yoga you have said, “Mother,

00:27:11.616 --> 00:27:14.993
there have been lots of miracles with Your Attention”,

00:27:15.194 --> 00:27:17.563
or something like that. I agree,

00:27:17.764 --> 00:27:22.180
but your attention also is quite capable of doing things

00:27:22.381 --> 00:27:24.664
which normal people can't do,

00:27:24.865 --> 00:27:27.773
because now your attention is purified, firstly,

00:27:27.974 --> 00:27:33.367
and secondly it is manipulated with the Divine Power,

00:27:33.568 --> 00:27:39.036
and is manifesting its powers.

00:27:39.966 --> 00:27:43.484
But, before that I have seen people who come to Sahaja Yog,

00:27:43.685 --> 00:27:46.828
they send me letters of crying, 'Mother, this is happening,

00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:51.805
that is happening, my father is sick and my leg is paining,

00:27:52.006 --> 00:27:54.344
my hands are paining', all kinds of things,

00:27:54.545 --> 00:27:57.034
not only at the physical level, but also on mental level,

00:27:57.235 --> 00:27:59.235
and all sorts of things, they go on.

00:27:59.436 --> 00:28:01.649
They sometimes write to Me such long letters,

00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:03.969
I don't know how to write it back.

00:28:04.170 --> 00:28:08.000
There's nothing to write so much.

00:28:08.201 --> 00:28:12.414
But they do, because at that stage they are still reacting,

00:28:12.615 --> 00:28:15.220
and they don't know what to do. They go to such a limit,

00:28:15.421 --> 00:28:17.829
that they think that Sahaja Yoga is like a contract.

00:28:18.030 --> 00:28:20.923
'Now I've come to Sahaja Yog, I must get this.

00:28:21.124 --> 00:28:23.124
This must happen. Only they come to Sahaja Yog,

00:28:23.325 --> 00:28:26.335
then they think it's a contract, and they must get this,

00:28:26.536 --> 00:28:28.536
and they must get that help.

00:28:28.737 --> 00:28:34.763
All this kind of behavior is not that of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:34.972 --> 00:28:38.974
Sahaj Yogi, in Sanskrit, is a very good word, Datasta.

00:28:39.175 --> 00:28:41.833
Is a very good word, which I'll try to explain,

00:28:42.034 --> 00:28:48.411
but cannot be really translated.

00:28:48.612 --> 00:28:53.716
Datasta means the one who is standing on the shore,

00:28:53.917 --> 00:28:57.614
on the shore and watching.

00:28:57.815 --> 00:29:01.247
That is the state in which you have to be.

00:29:01.448 --> 00:29:07.244
But, as a result, you do not become a person who is not effective.

00:29:07.698 --> 00:29:10.661
You become extremely effective.

00:29:10.862 --> 00:29:13.310
If such people are there,

00:29:13.511 --> 00:29:17.123
you won't believe so many things can happen.

00:29:17.324 --> 00:29:19.982
Wars can stop,

00:29:20.183 --> 00:29:23.052
peace can spread,

00:29:23.253 --> 00:29:27.372
people who are evil will be exposed.

00:29:27.573 --> 00:29:34.044
Now, because it's such an en-masse working out of Sahaja Yog,

00:29:34.245 --> 00:29:38.521
Sahaja Yogis should not, in any way,

00:29:38.722 --> 00:29:42.380
find themselves in conflict with each other.

00:29:42.581 --> 00:29:45.997
Still, I find sometimes. And I'm amazed,

00:29:46.198 --> 00:29:49.544
how people criticize other Sahaja Yogis, or other leaders,

00:29:49.745 --> 00:29:52.607
while they themselves have problems.

00:29:52.808 --> 00:29:56.982
The reason is that once you start going beyond the mind,

00:29:57.183 --> 00:30:00.841
you automatically become introspective.

00:30:01.042 --> 00:30:03.091
And you start seeing, 'What's wrong with me,

00:30:03.292 --> 00:30:06.185
this mind of mine, now?'

00:30:06.386 --> 00:30:08.386
So, better stand before the mirror,

00:30:08.587 --> 00:30:11.784
or can even close your eyes and say, “Now, Mr. Mind,

00:30:11.985 --> 00:30:14.479
what are you doing?

00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.680
What are you up to?”

00:30:16.881 --> 00:30:20.354
You face yourself, you stand out from yourself,

00:30:20.555 --> 00:30:26.695
and see for yourself and ask the mind, “What are you up to?"

00:30:26.977 --> 00:30:31.339
That's the way, once you are out of it you can control it.

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.847
I'm happy you are celebrating My Birthday.

00:30:34.048 --> 00:30:37.206
Now I'm supposed to be quite old, though I don't think like that,

00:30:37.407 --> 00:30:39.407
because I don't think.

00:30:39.608 --> 00:30:44.626
One has to be beyond, beyond the mind.

00:30:44.827 --> 00:30:47.251
To think about yourself all the time

00:30:47.452 --> 00:30:50.829
or to think about things

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.852
which do not concern you sometimes, you know.

00:30:54.053 --> 00:30:57.532
And just try to put your mind into a turmoil,

00:30:57.733 --> 00:31:02.436
It is very dangerous these days.

00:31:03.108 --> 00:31:05.108
To stop your thought, first of all,

00:31:05.309 --> 00:31:08.577
I think in Sahaja Yoga you should stop reading anything.

00:31:08.778 --> 00:31:12.311
Because if you start reading, then what happens again,

00:31:12.512 --> 00:31:15.288
you start collecting thoughts from that book.

00:31:15.489 --> 00:31:17.489
I've seen many people

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:20.544
whose mind is nothing but the books from others,

00:31:20.745 --> 00:31:24.060
or the words of others, or quotation of others.

00:31:24.261 --> 00:31:26.498
They are nowhere. You cannot find them.

00:31:26.699 --> 00:31:31.178
They are all lost people, “He says so and that one say so."

00:31:31.379 --> 00:31:33.379
When I was writing this book,

00:31:33.596 --> 00:31:36.676
which you know that I have written down, they were saying,

00:31:36.877 --> 00:31:42.949
“Mother, but Plato said like this, and Rousseau said like that.”

00:31:43.150 --> 00:31:45.574
I said, “Let them say whatever they wanted to,

00:31:45.775 --> 00:31:48.991
I'll say what I know. Why should I refer to them.

00:31:49.192 --> 00:31:51.194
I don't have to go to the libraries and read

00:31:51.395 --> 00:31:55.857
what Rousseau said, what Plato said, what - nothing.”

00:31:56.058 --> 00:31:59.646
What I know, whatever I have witnessed in My life,

00:31:59.847 --> 00:32:02.576
I should write it.

00:32:02.777 --> 00:32:06.654
Clearly, without thinking about what others have to say,

00:32:06.855 --> 00:32:09.310
what others have described.

00:32:09.511 --> 00:32:13.388
And also another, this mind has another big, big problem,

00:32:13.589 --> 00:32:18.716
that whatever is written down in black and white becomes Bible.

00:32:18.917 --> 00:32:24.161
Then, whatever is done before

00:32:24.362 --> 00:32:29.317
is something great. Like, now there is no Christ,

00:32:29.518 --> 00:32:34.809
there is no Mohammed Sahib, and there is no Abraham.

00:32:35.010 --> 00:32:38.762
There's no Krishna, there's no Ram today.

00:32:38.963 --> 00:32:43.145
But they will think of what Rama said, what Krishna said,

00:32:43.346 --> 00:32:46.934
then in Gita, this He said, in Gita He has not said a word

00:32:47.135 --> 00:32:51.814
about Kundalini, so why Mother is talking about Kundalini?

00:32:52.237 --> 00:32:55.317
He might have said – can't say – who wrote Gita?

00:32:55.518 --> 00:32:59.379
Never Sri Krishna. Christ never wrote Bible.

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.411
Koran was not written by Mohammed Sahib.

00:33:02.612 --> 00:33:07.315
So, what they have said – why should you worry about that?

00:33:07.628 --> 00:33:11.661
Instead of that, you take the experience that everybody has said.

00:33:11.862 --> 00:33:14.880
That, “You are to be born again”, everybody has said.

00:33:15.081 --> 00:33:18.450
That, “You have to go beyond the mind”, also everyone has said.

00:33:18.651 --> 00:33:22.239
Why not do that and then see for yourself?

00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.458
But people like, and they're identified.

00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:27.263
Now, if they are Christians, who are coming to Sahaj Yoga,

00:33:27.464 --> 00:33:31.990
still they are happy if it is Christ, very identified,

00:33:32.191 --> 00:33:36.123
if they are Hindus should be Krishna, or Rama maybe.

00:33:36.324 --> 00:33:39.803
If they are Muslims, it should be Mohammed Sahib, Fatima or someone.

00:33:40.004 --> 00:33:42.803
Otherwise, they can't get out of it, this is very difficult.

00:33:43.004 --> 00:33:47.224
Their mind is such that is so much made, from childhood,

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:48.876
you are told, “You are a Muslim, you are a Muslim,

00:33:49.077 --> 00:33:52.030
you are a Christian, you are a Christian”, so they believe it.

00:33:52.231 --> 00:33:54.849
Supposing you are born in some other religion

00:33:55.050 --> 00:33:58.474
then what would have happened?

00:33:58.675 --> 00:34:00.771
You would have believed something different,

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:05.310
but this mind has been injected with the ideas

00:34:05.511 --> 00:34:07.511
which has gone into your head

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:13.917
and that's how you are so much without any freedom.

00:34:14.118 --> 00:34:17.269
You are tied down with these conditionings.

00:34:17.470 --> 00:34:21.980
And that's what I find among Sahaja Yogis also,

00:34:22.181 --> 00:34:26.605
a very big conditioning that

00:34:26.806 --> 00:34:34.546
such and such thing is good or bad, they decide.

00:34:34.747 --> 00:34:39.507
You see for yourself. For example, if I talk on Guru Nanak,

00:34:39.708 --> 00:34:42.320
then the Sikhs will be very happy,

00:34:42.521 --> 00:34:45.929
but I talk on Christ, they won't be happy.

00:34:46.130 --> 00:34:49.124
I talked on Christ in Poona, so they said,

00:34:49.325 --> 00:34:51.929
“She's trying to convert everybody to Christianity”,

00:34:52.130 --> 00:34:56.304
and when I was talking about Shri Krishna in London,

00:34:56.505 --> 00:35:00.632
they said, “She's making everybody a Hindu.”

00:35:00.833 --> 00:35:05.280
So this identification that we have

00:35:05.481 --> 00:35:10.785
is coming to us when so intensely, from,

00:35:10.986 --> 00:35:13.741
we should say, it's like from the birth.

00:35:13.942 --> 00:35:17.679
All these ideas still are there and we are not free.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:21.515
That doesn't mean that you should not have faith in all of these people.

00:35:21.716 --> 00:35:25.710
They were all great, we have great respect for them and understanding.

00:35:25.911 --> 00:35:32.218
But first you be free, you be free to know them.

00:35:32.419 --> 00:35:35.577
Your mind should be free. It should not be the injections

00:35:35.778 --> 00:35:39.632
that are put into your heads, that you cannot see the point.

00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:41.982
That's why they don't enjoy also, I've seen,

00:35:42.183 --> 00:35:46.295
partly they enjoy, partly they don't.

00:35:46.496 --> 00:35:48.647
So, to become a free person,

00:35:48.848 --> 00:35:53.170
because Sahaj Yoga is to give you complete freedom,

00:35:53.371 --> 00:35:57.490
and also complete sense of freedom,

00:35:57.691 --> 00:36:00.420
so you respect the freedom of others,

00:36:00.621 --> 00:36:03.936
on the whole you understand what freedom is.

00:36:04.137 --> 00:36:10.871
If that doesn't work out, then I would
say that Sahaja Yoga is of no use,

00:36:11.072 --> 00:36:14.144
because it should work out in such a manner that

00:36:14.345 --> 00:36:20.191
you should get rid of all these conditionings you have had.

00:36:20.392 --> 00:36:25.832
Now, take the second enemy of ours – is Mr. Ego,

00:36:26.033 --> 00:36:28.033
which is another headache,

00:36:28.234 --> 00:36:32.346
and which works very fast in many countries

00:36:32.547 --> 00:36:36.838
where already ego has been bloated.

00:36:37.039 --> 00:36:39.925
See these balloons.

00:36:40.126 --> 00:36:42.331
If they were bloated, all right,

00:36:42.532 --> 00:36:46.558
it’s very easy to again make them big,

00:36:46.759 --> 00:36:49.876
but if they were never done that, then it's difficult,

00:36:50.077 --> 00:36:52.673
you have to pull it out, you have to put it to the pumps,

00:36:52.874 --> 00:36:55.345
otherwise it won't be bloated.

00:36:55.546 --> 00:36:59.962
Now, this ego comes to us from different, different angles,

00:37:00.163 --> 00:37:03.275
and it - actually, you'll be surprised,

00:37:03.476 --> 00:37:06.322
from the deformity of our chakras.

00:37:06.523 --> 00:37:11.205
For some people, money is very important.

00:37:11.406 --> 00:37:13.406
We must get money, somehow or other.

00:37:13.607 --> 00:37:15.984
If I don't get money, what's the use of being in Sahaja Yoga?

00:37:16.185 --> 00:37:18.812
Money is very important.

00:37:19.013 --> 00:37:22.460
We are living in a money-oriented world, no doubt.

00:37:22.661 --> 00:37:26.085
But I have told you that what's the use of having money

00:37:26.286 --> 00:37:29.724
that makes you a fool, which takes you –

00:37:29.925 --> 00:37:35.021
now, see the countries which are very much money- oriented,

00:37:35.222 --> 00:37:37.599
who are supposed to be very rich,

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:41.310
all the Scandinavian countries and Switzerland,

00:37:41.511 --> 00:37:44.696
whatever may be have, they might have done to get that money,

00:37:44.897 --> 00:37:47.759
doesn't matter, but they are people with money.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.863
People are committing suicide, young people are committing suicide,

00:37:51.064 --> 00:37:54.402
there's a competition going on, they're very unhappy. Why?

00:37:54.603 --> 00:37:58.113
That means money cannot bring happiness.

00:37:58.314 --> 00:38:02.769
Money, money, money, money, if that goes into your head also,

00:38:02.970 --> 00:38:06.105
then you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:38:06.306 --> 00:38:12.691
But the money is there just for you to use it

00:38:12.892 --> 00:38:16.696
to express your love.

00:38:16.978 --> 00:38:23.488
Now, you go to the shop.

00:38:23.689 --> 00:38:26.222
Then you see something, "Aaaah!

00:38:26.423 --> 00:38:33.399
This is very nice to be given to such and such person."

00:38:33.861 --> 00:38:37.027
You think like that. It's a very sweet feeling you get there.

00:38:37.228 --> 00:38:41.294
Ah - you can give this to this one, eh? He needs it very much.

00:38:41.495 --> 00:38:45.778
When your mind becomes the other way round,

00:38:45.979 --> 00:38:48.262
I mean, when it is thoughtlessly aware,

00:38:48.463 --> 00:38:53.856
then you will buy something that is joy giving,

00:38:54.057 --> 00:38:58.676
something artistic, something beautiful,

00:38:58.877 --> 00:39:03.892
something useful to that person.

00:39:04.588 --> 00:39:11.942
It will be a kind of a mind that will be extremely full of generosity,

00:39:12.143 --> 00:39:14.723
enjoying its generosity.

00:39:14.924 --> 00:39:18.778
And all the time it will guide you

00:39:18.979 --> 00:39:26.659
to the projection of your attention to things

00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:32.211
by which you can give happiness to others.

00:39:32.868 --> 00:39:37.599
Small, small things, not necessarily expensive things.

00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:41.638
If you have money better spend money in buying things

00:39:41.839 --> 00:39:49.216
that you can give to others, that you can express your love,

00:39:49.417 --> 00:39:53.713
your gratitude, your Shraddha.

00:39:54.245 --> 00:40:01.489
It is very remarkable how people give money to these sadhus and babas

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.690
in thousands and thousands and crores of it.

00:40:05.354 --> 00:40:09.317
Because, I think in them it has come that

00:40:09.518 --> 00:40:11.971
to satisfy their Shraddha

00:40:12.172 --> 00:40:15.176
they must give it, and so they give.

00:40:15.377 --> 00:40:19.699
And they have amassed and amassed so much money,

00:40:19.900 --> 00:40:24.056
they have no sense of it. They don't understand the value of that.

00:40:24.257 --> 00:40:26.814
To them it is nothing but money.

00:40:27.015 --> 00:40:33.103
So, in the modern times I think the worst thing of ego is money.

00:40:33.304 --> 00:40:35.570
I have seen people who are very rich,

00:40:35.771 --> 00:40:39.695
supposed to be great business walahs and something like that,

00:40:39.896 --> 00:40:42.018
they must meet Me separately,

00:40:42.219 --> 00:40:47.172
“We must come, Mother, and see You.”

00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:52.081
But they're useless people, absolutely useless.

00:40:52.282 --> 00:40:55.242
So they'll come and tell Me, “You know, I’m having a loss in this,

00:40:55.443 --> 00:40:57.443
I'm having a loss in that,

00:40:57.690 --> 00:41:02.033
can you help us in this way or that way?”

00:41:02.318 --> 00:41:04.992
I just don't say anything to them, but they have said,

00:41:05.193 --> 00:41:07.294
“Mother we have recovered because of Your blessings.” Maybe.

00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:12.336
But it’s stupid.

00:41:12.537 --> 00:41:18.102
Like Lao-Tse described that you are going through the Yangtse river,

00:41:18.303 --> 00:41:22.954
it's beautiful. On the sides you see beautiful scenes,

00:41:23.155 --> 00:41:28.087
but you better be on the boat and reach the ocean.

00:41:28.288 --> 00:41:31.126
In the same way, supposing we have to catch a plane,

00:41:31.327 --> 00:41:33.353
and we see something very nice on the road

00:41:33.554 --> 00:41:38.400
and get down there, how can we catch the plane?

00:41:38.601 --> 00:41:43.775
So these side-effects of this mind are these,

00:41:43.976 --> 00:41:48.525
that we divert our attention to wrong things

00:41:48.726 --> 00:41:52.213
and waste our energy into it. Ultimately we are not happy,

00:41:52.414 --> 00:41:57.197
as you know that the - in general - wants are not satiable.

00:41:57.398 --> 00:42:05.369
It’s the love that you give and the love that you receive,

00:42:05.570 --> 00:42:09.650
which is not a love which is entangled into anything

00:42:09.851 --> 00:42:12.658
with any purpose, with any idea,

00:42:12.859 --> 00:42:17.791
but just to feel that love,

00:42:17.992 --> 00:42:25.307
pure love within yourself and within others.

00:42:25.508 --> 00:42:29.588
Is the greatest gift of the Divine.

00:42:29.789 --> 00:42:33.619
All other things are useless, you'll find it.

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.603
You find it every day. Today you want to have a car,

00:42:36.804 --> 00:42:38.990
all right, have it. Then you want to have a house, have it,

00:42:39.191 --> 00:42:41.191
but you are not bothered about the car,

00:42:41.392 --> 00:42:43.392
now you want to have a house. Now you get the house,

00:42:43.593 --> 00:42:45.593
then you are not satisfied.

00:42:45.794 --> 00:42:50.348
Then you want to have something else and something else.

00:42:50.857 --> 00:42:56.015
So then, which is that 'want' which is satisfying?

00:42:56.216 --> 00:43:02.335
It’s this pure love, genuine love
that you feel for the others,

00:43:02.536 --> 00:43:06.348
and others feel for you.

00:43:07.145 --> 00:43:10.921
We have others, lots of conditionings of ego.

00:43:11.122 --> 00:43:16.210
In our country specially, this Indian country, India - so-called. ”

00:43:16.411 --> 00:43:20.648
You see, to dominate the wife is one of the greatest ego.

00:43:20.849 --> 00:43:24.875
I have seen people, how they tortured women,

00:43:25.076 --> 00:43:28.945
their wives and the children of others,

00:43:29.146 --> 00:43:33.466
just because they think, “I am a man."

00:43:34.521 --> 00:43:36.661
What do you get? You don't get any joy,

00:43:36.862 --> 00:43:38.945
you can never be joyous.

00:43:39.146 --> 00:43:44.375
If you try to dominate another person you can never be joyous.

00:43:44.576 --> 00:43:49.391
Never be joyous. It's only through loving and affection

00:43:49.592 --> 00:43:53.993
and care that you can feel the joy,

00:43:54.194 --> 00:43:58.040
because joy has these symptoms,

00:43:58.241 --> 00:44:02.681
joy is not domination, or demanding, or asking.

00:44:02.882 --> 00:44:06.533
These are not the signs of a person who is joyous.

00:44:06.734 --> 00:44:13.346
The joyous person is that who just enjoys the caring,

00:44:13.547 --> 00:44:21.070
the loving, the gentle relationship.

00:44:21.499 --> 00:44:24.882
And this is another point where I think

00:44:25.084 --> 00:44:27.930
Indian men specially, especially in the North,

00:44:28.131 --> 00:44:30.993
because of, they say Muslim influence, whatever it is,

00:44:31.194 --> 00:44:36.751
in the North the men are extremely dominating to their wives.

00:44:36.952 --> 00:44:39.181
And they insult the wife also very much.

00:44:39.398 --> 00:44:43.064
So now the women here have become extremely dominating also,

00:44:43.265 --> 00:44:45.353
naturally action has a reaction.

00:44:45.554 --> 00:44:49.056
This reaction itself is a wrong idea,

00:44:49.257 --> 00:44:52.751
and this reaction should be just dissolved

00:44:52.952 --> 00:45:00.162
into the feeling of pure love, the Ocean of Compassion.

00:45:00.655 --> 00:45:03.095
For example, I see on the streets of Delhi,

00:45:03.296 --> 00:45:06.079
so many people begging, small children are there,

00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:13.688
and all that. And now the feeling that I get is not of

00:45:13.889 --> 00:45:16.219
scolding them or getting angry with them.

00:45:16.420 --> 00:45:18.977
Maybe they are cheating, maybe anything they're after.

00:45:19.178 --> 00:45:21.178
Everybody's cheating you, and those who have lots of money

00:45:21.435 --> 00:45:23.435
are cheating you, so what is there

00:45:23.636 --> 00:45:25.636
if these poor people are cheating, doesn't matter.

00:45:25.837 --> 00:45:29.169
But the compassion is built-in within Me like this that,

00:45:29.370 --> 00:45:35.364
“Let Me somehow get a plot of land somewhere,

00:45:35.565 --> 00:45:41.005
let Me organize some sort of a place

00:45:41.206 --> 00:45:46.239
where all these people who are orphans can be put there,

00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:52.057
and given all the...

00:45:54.971 --> 00:46:01.981
all the help. And maybe from this pond of misery and poverty

00:46:02.182 --> 00:46:05.403
you might get lots of lotuses coming out.

00:46:05.604 --> 00:46:08.692
But the feeling has to be collective.

00:46:08.893 --> 00:46:13.419
I feel that way, that we'll solve the problem of Delhi,

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:16.767
but that doesn't mean that, like other social workers,

00:46:16.968 --> 00:46:20.361
like I have been connected with some social workers

00:46:20.562 --> 00:46:22.562
and I was amazed that it was nothing but

00:46:22.763 --> 00:46:24.812
a ego-pampering business.

00:46:25.013 --> 00:46:27.328
It has nothing to do with social workers.

00:46:27.529 --> 00:46:36.164
Haphazard and nothing deep in their attention

00:46:36.365 --> 00:46:38.365
to look after these people.

00:46:38.566 --> 00:46:43.224
So with the great feeling of love and compassion we can do it,

00:46:43.425 --> 00:46:46.607
we all can do it, and can work it out.

00:46:46.808 --> 00:46:53.029
One of My desires is this. If it is a desire of you all,

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.763
it will work out. It's very important

00:46:55.964 --> 00:47:01.005
that they are also human beings and we have to look after them.

00:47:01.206 --> 00:47:03.206
But for that, one should not think that,

00:47:03.407 --> 00:47:07.815
“I will be the treasurer or I'll be the president, and I'll be this.”

00:47:08.016 --> 00:47:11.674
All this clergy-ship should go away

00:47:11.875 --> 00:47:16.518
from the mind itself, otherwise you are not free.

00:47:16.719 --> 00:47:21.416
You are not free, you know, like there's a nice joke about it,

00:47:21.617 --> 00:47:26.994
that – one - somebody went to see the minister

00:47:27.195 --> 00:47:32.877
and the private secretary was there, attending to the people.

00:47:33.078 --> 00:47:36.315
And he was getting very angry with them and all that,

00:47:36.516 --> 00:47:39.487
so some villagers said to him, “Who are you?”

00:47:39.688 --> 00:47:46.268
He said, “Don't you know, I'm P.A.?” “Ah, P.A.”

00:47:46.469 --> 00:47:51.229
That means you are drunk, all right, we have nothing to say.

00:47:51.430 --> 00:47:56.987
So, a person with ego behaves like a person who has ego,

00:47:57.188 --> 00:48:02.589
is a person like a - you can say, a drunkard,

00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:06.277
or sometimes like a lunatic also, really like a lunatic.

00:48:06.478 --> 00:48:09.347
Sometimes you have to meet them with a bargepole, I told you.

00:48:09.548 --> 00:48:12.722
Some of these people who have got awards for peace,

00:48:12.923 --> 00:48:15.425
we have to talk to them with a bargepole,

00:48:15.626 --> 00:48:18.730
because they might just jump on you, just like a cat,

00:48:18.931 --> 00:48:21.253
or could be like a leopard,

00:48:21.454 --> 00:48:23.454
you don't know how they are built up.

00:48:23.655 --> 00:48:26.126
I don’t know how they got these awards for peace, but they have.

00:48:26.327 --> 00:48:28.915
So, the peace is within ourselves

00:48:29.116 --> 00:48:32.712
and this peace has to be retained

00:48:32.913 --> 00:48:36.689
and introspected and seen.

00:48:36.890 --> 00:48:40.580
Are we peaceful or we are reacting?

00:48:40.781 --> 00:48:44.330
If we are reacting, then we are not peaceful.

00:48:44.531 --> 00:48:48.164
But people will say, 'Yes, yes, I am very peaceful, but I have to react'.

00:48:48.365 --> 00:48:54.078
Then you are not peaceful. Just face yourself,

00:48:54.279 --> 00:48:56.672
straightforward and see for yourself

00:48:56.873 --> 00:49:03.289
that if you are peaceful then this peace will spread all over,

00:49:03.490 --> 00:49:06.781
it will help others. It give them physical, mental,

00:49:06.982 --> 00:49:09.953
emotional and spiritual peace.

00:49:10.154 --> 00:49:13.039
So, you people have a great responsibility

00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:16.766
of coming to Sahaja Yoga. It is not just a certificate,

00:49:16.967 --> 00:49:21.256
or My badge, that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:49:21.623 --> 00:49:24.758
I would like also women to see to this point,

00:49:24.959 --> 00:49:27.446
because what I have seen about women is that

00:49:27.654 --> 00:49:29.654
they are mostly worried about their children,

00:49:29.855 --> 00:49:32.529
about their husbands, jobs and things like that.

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.201
But they are not worried about others,

00:49:35.402 --> 00:49:38.060
about people who are around them,

00:49:38.261 --> 00:49:42.388
so they have to also take to Sahaja style of life,

00:49:42.589 --> 00:49:46.826
in which they expand their love,

00:49:47.027 --> 00:49:50.982
expand their attention to other people,

00:49:51.183 --> 00:49:54.834
and see how they can please others.

00:49:55.035 --> 00:49:57.568
This situation is –

00:49:57.769 --> 00:50:01.942
used to be non-existent in the western countries.

00:50:02.143 --> 00:50:05.973
I think they never knew that you should please somebody

00:50:06.174 --> 00:50:09.332
for no reward, or for no purpose.

00:50:09.533 --> 00:50:12.105
If you give any present to somebody, they'll say,

00:50:12.306 --> 00:50:14.306
'Oh. What do you want?'.

00:50:14.507 --> 00:50:17.611
'Do you want coffee, or', immediately.

00:50:17.812 --> 00:50:20.002
To them they cannot understand that

00:50:20.203 --> 00:50:24.354
somebody wants to express one's love, no, they can't.

00:50:24.555 --> 00:50:27.862
So, this – now mind has changed, because Sahaja Yogis are there

00:50:28.063 --> 00:50:30.063
and they are different people,

00:50:30.264 --> 00:50:33.751
but what I have seen before was so remarkable,

00:50:33.952 --> 00:50:36.800
that they thought it was a weakness that they are giving

00:50:37.001 --> 00:50:40.081
those presents because they feel they're weak.

00:50:40.282 --> 00:50:44.261
All these ideas have changing in the West,

00:50:44.462 --> 00:50:49.284
and also we should not adopt their stupid ideas that

00:50:49.485 --> 00:50:53.886
we can control people by giving them things

00:50:54.087 --> 00:51:00.449
or by giving them some sort of promises.

00:51:00.650 --> 00:51:04.517
We have, actually, to control ourselves

00:51:04.718 --> 00:51:10.730
and that control can come if you do
not allow your mind to control you.

00:51:10.938 --> 00:51:14.425
That control is the complete freedom.

00:51:14.626 --> 00:51:20.698
For example now, take an aeroplane which is perfectly built,

00:51:20.899 --> 00:51:26.167
which is absolutely all right. Then only it can fly.

00:51:26.368 --> 00:51:31.089
In the same way, if you are a perfect Sahaja Yogi

00:51:31.290 --> 00:51:36.362
then you will have no problems in dealing with any problem,

00:51:36.563 --> 00:51:42.815
with any circumstances, with any person whatsoever.

00:51:43.016 --> 00:51:45.677
There are many Sahaja Yogis in the West I’ve seen, they’ve said,

00:51:45.878 --> 00:51:48.518
“Mother, we don’t want to take any active work

00:51:48.719 --> 00:51:50.854
because we’ll develop our ego."

00:51:51.055 --> 00:51:53.213
They think their balloon is already bloated out

00:51:53.414 --> 00:51:56.002
and if they do some work their ego will go up,

00:51:56.203 --> 00:52:00.525
so they say, “We don’t want to do.” It’s not so.

00:52:00.726 --> 00:52:03.861
Is their love. You’re working for Love.

00:52:04.062 --> 00:52:07.650
Such an Ocean of Love is within you.

00:52:07.851 --> 00:52:10.994
How can you do without that?

00:52:11.195 --> 00:52:15.025
And this has to work out at every level,

00:52:15.226 --> 00:52:21.283
whether it is your family, whether it is your city,

00:52:21.484 --> 00:52:27.096
whether it is your country or the whole world.

00:52:27.297 --> 00:52:31.674
This is the new generation we have to create of people

00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:34.877
who believe in Love which is Truth.

00:52:35.078 --> 00:52:39.049
Which is Truth. Without Love you cannot have Truth,

00:52:39.250 --> 00:52:42.010
because when you love somebody you know everything

00:52:42.211 --> 00:52:44.299
about that person. In the same way,

00:52:44.500 --> 00:52:47.658
when you love your country you know everything about that country.

00:52:47.859 --> 00:52:49.859
But first you must love.

00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.060
Why people are now having problems?

00:52:52.261 --> 00:52:54.630
Because they don’t love their country.

00:52:54.831 --> 00:52:58.396
If you love your country you will know what is the essence

00:52:58.597 --> 00:53:02.404
of your country, what is the problems of your country,

00:53:02.605 --> 00:53:07.255
what it is going through. And that intense feeling of oneness

00:53:07.456 --> 00:53:09.456
itself will work out,

00:53:09.657 --> 00:53:12.565
because after all you are connected to the Divine.

00:53:12.766 --> 00:53:17.713
But with intensity you should feel for all these things

00:53:17.914 --> 00:53:19.914
that are really so destructive

00:53:20.115 --> 00:53:24.075
and troublesome in these modern times.

00:53:24.396 --> 00:53:28.054
I again want to thank you for celebrating this birthday

00:53:28.255 --> 00:53:32.773
and for all the sweetness you have showered upon Me.

00:53:32.974 --> 00:53:36.789
You are just like these beautiful flowers for Me,

00:53:36.990 --> 00:53:42.516
which are anxious all the time to make you happy,

00:53:42.717 --> 00:53:45.360
to please you.

00:53:45.561 --> 00:53:48.313
Just like that I find you before Me,

00:53:48.522 --> 00:53:51.438
beautiful flowers, fragrant with divinity.

00:53:51.639 --> 00:53:57.553
I hope you all will understand your own value and work it out.

00:53:57.754 --> 00:53:59.754
May God bless you.
