WEBVTT

00:00.470 --> 00:07.470
I bow to

00:49.580 --> 00:56.580
all the seekers of truth. I’ve been many
a times in Birmingham before and today I find

03:42.260 --> 03:49.260
there are so many people whom I know very
well, and gradually we are all increasing

03:53.209 --> 03:57.709
in size, understanding our Spirit.

03:57.709 --> 04:04.709
Now, the seeking of the Spirit is not a new
thing. It’s a very ancient pursuit of human

04:10.530 --> 04:17.530
beings. They have been seeking the Spirit
and many a times many prophets, many great

04:22.810 --> 04:29.810
incarnations came on this Earth to help the
people in their pursuit. The seeking of the

04:36.520 --> 04:43.520
Spirit is a inner urge, a very compelling
urge within ourselves. But we don’t know

04:48.669 --> 04:55.669
what we have to seek; we don’t know what
it means to be twice born.

05:03.300 --> 05:10.300
I come from India and suddenly I feel I belong
to Britain. I’ve become British and I feel

05:21.030 --> 05:28.030
the shock that we are all facing. Where are
we going? The other day I saw some program

05:35.590 --> 05:42.590
about cocaine smuggling in England and I was
shocked. All self-destructive things sometimes

05:52.290 --> 05:57.500
can be misunderstood as Spirit seeking. One
can misunderstand. But they lead us nowhere

05:57.500 --> 06:04.500
- is a fact. Then why do we do it? We do it
- I know that we do it only because we are

06:21.639 --> 06:28.639
seeking the Spirit. It’s very misleading,
though. We seek the Spirit in wrong things.

06:30.350 --> 06:37.350
This urge we think will be fulfilled by wrong
things, by doing wrong to ourselves, by harming

06:41.070 --> 06:44.009
ourselves, by torturing ourselves.

06:44.009 --> 06:51.009
We get bored. Why? Why do we get bored of
life? Life should be bubbling with joy. Because

06:55.210 --> 07:02.180
we think life is worth nothing, we have to
seek. And what do we seek there? It’s a

07:02.180 --> 07:09.180
amazing thing how many seekers are born in
the West – so many seekers! Even I talk

07:14.930 --> 07:21.930
to little children and I am surprised that
there is seeking within them. They are seeking

07:24.180 --> 07:31.180
something and they don’t understand the
mystery of seeking. They don’t even understand

07:36.440 --> 07:43.199
what they are seeking, but they think there’s
something wrong. They feel frustrated, angered,

07:43.199 --> 07:49.000
and they feel that life has not given them
what they wanted. They’re bored stiff; they

07:49.000 --> 07:56.000
don’t know what to do so they take to vandalism,
some sort of a sensation. They try to destroy

07:56.590 --> 08:02.849
others or themselves.

08:02.849 --> 08:09.849
So the human mind today is at a different
level, we must understand, especially in the

08:12.470 --> 08:16.910
West. Of course East has its own problems,
but it has traditional understanding about

08:16.910 --> 08:23.910
seeking and it understands what to seek. But
in the West such intense seekers are there

08:25.400 --> 08:32.400
and they don’t know what to seek, what to
achieve, what is Spirit. It’s a big problem.

08:33.349 --> 08:40.349
But today one has to realize that the category
of people that are born in these modern times

08:43.259 --> 08:50.259
are very different from the people who were
born about say, I would say fifty years back.

08:51.149 --> 08:58.149
They had political ambitions, economic ambitions;
they wanted to achieve political freedom,

09:01.759 --> 09:08.759
power. That generation is practically over
now. They have realized that in this power

09:11.040 --> 09:18.040
game they’re not going to gain anything.
It’s a subject finished now for them; it’s

09:18.679 --> 09:25.679
something absurd. They find the whole thing
is a joke - same with the economic problem.

09:25.769 --> 09:32.769
Like there was once upon a time a gold rush.
So everybody rushed to find the gold. Today

09:34.589 --> 09:41.589
if anybody wants to do that, people will think,
“Are you mad? Must be joking.”

09:43.100 --> 09:50.100
So the category of people today are of a different
level, we must be aware of that. We must understand

09:51.600 --> 09:57.929
that the category is very different which
perhaps media people don’t understand so

09:57.929 --> 10:04.540
much. I don’t think they have any idea as
to what is the level of awareness of human

10:04.540 --> 10:11.540
beings today in the West. They are still of
that old school which was busy fighting elections

10:12.860 --> 10:19.860
or strikes and this and that - all nonsensical
things. But the people who are aware are many,

10:24.689 --> 10:31.689
many more than yet what we know of, that they
are seeking something very different that

10:33.529 --> 10:40.529
their fathers and forefathers did not seek,
because the times are such. Today, it’s

10:40.949 --> 10:47.949
a special time – special time where many
people have to get their Spirit. But then

10:49.739 --> 10:56.739
again we are misled because people who are
trying to exploit this have found a good market,

11:01.040 --> 11:08.040
and they come down to find out how they can
market their goods in this new awareness of

11:11.910 --> 11:13.389
people.

11:13.389 --> 11:20.389
We get enamored because we are still not fully
conscious or knowledgeable about what to expect

11:24.449 --> 11:31.449
in your spiritual pursuit. And that’s how
they come and befool us. We have cults and

11:32.239 --> 11:39.239
we have sects, but one must understand that
as you have grown through amoeba in your evolutionary

11:43.059 --> 11:50.059
process, gradually, from that to this level,
the awareness has to also grow the same way,

11:51.809 --> 11:58.259
in a traditional way. It cannot be somebody
like Freud coming up and saying something

11:58.259 --> 12:05.259
new, that we accept. Suddenly, how can we
deviate from all those who talked of something

12:10.459 --> 12:17.459
very different from what Freud has been talking?
Because it’s a mind which is of course very

12:19.660 --> 12:26.660
aware, but also it is what we call very right-sided
mind, as is described in the Gita they are

12:27.189 --> 12:34.189
called as the people who are rajasikas, the
people who are in action. They live with the

12:37.019 --> 12:40.480
power of action.

12:40.480 --> 12:47.480
So the people who live with the power of their
action live with their egos, and ego likes

12:48.569 --> 12:54.709
something new, some sort of a new stuff comes
in they think, “Oh, why not do that? Try

12:54.709 --> 13:01.709
this, try that.” It’s like a horse which
wants to go into every new direction and fails.

13:05.449 --> 13:12.449
It’s a very venturesome horse, I think,
and that’s how something new somebody says,

13:13.959 --> 13:20.959
everybody jumps to it. We are not new ourselves,
we are ancient. And when we take to some new

13:25.489 --> 13:32.489
idea suddenly we find after some time that
we have to recoil back, because these are

13:34.569 --> 13:41.569
all mental projections and that’s how in
every religion there have been sects formed.

13:42.609 --> 13:49.609
Because, say Catholicism - Martin Luther who
was himself a realized soul saw that Pope

13:52.379 --> 13:59.379
was doing all kinds of wrong things, so he
started a new sect. But it’s a mental projection

13:59.449 --> 14:06.449
still, I would say, though he was a realized
soul. Then out of that came out I don’t

14:07.689 --> 14:13.079
know how many churches. So now we have one
Unification Church which turned out to be

14:13.079 --> 14:19.029
another horrible stuff, then we have Unity
Church where they unite all these sects – is

14:19.029 --> 14:26.029
all projections, all branches of that mental
movement. But the essence is lost. In the

14:28.859 --> 14:35.859
first case it was lost, and it was completely
forgotten in the last case.

14:38.209 --> 14:45.009
So that’s how the sects were born. Now we
find Pentecostals. The other day I was reading

14:45.009 --> 14:52.009
the harm it has done to people. We have all
kinds of faiths - Seventh Day Adventists.

14:52.419 --> 14:59.419
What does it matter what was the seventh day,
the Sabbath? Supposing you have your Sabbath

15:00.259 --> 15:07.259
day, say, on the seventh day, will you become
righteous? Will you become virtuous? Will

15:09.220 --> 15:16.220
you become your Spirit? By changing a particular
type of ideology or thought, will you be transformed,

15:31.720 --> 15:38.529
will you become great, will you become a super
human being? No. Then what? You think that

15:38.529 --> 15:43.129
by going from one sect to another sect you’ll
achieve something great, you will just form

15:43.129 --> 15:50.129
different social orders, that’s all.

15:50.379 --> 15:57.379
Then you have anti-culture, another sect formed
as a reaction. That also is another problem.

15:59.579 --> 16:06.439
All these venturesome ideas of this horse
takes you from places to places, and you think,

16:06.439 --> 16:11.600
“Why whenever we try to do something why
we are committing the mistake?” Because

16:11.600 --> 16:18.600
we have forgotten the fundamental, and the
fundamental is very simple, that you have

16:20.379 --> 16:27.379
to seek your Spirit, and when you seek your
Spirit it is a spontaneous happening, it’s

16:28.139 --> 16:35.139
a living process in your evolutionary process
by which you become the Spirit. By mental

16:37.160 --> 16:39.739
projection you cannot.

16:39.739 --> 16:46.739
Then the people who took advantage of the
situation that there are so many seekers on

16:47.889 --> 16:54.889
this Earth, they started all kinds of cults,
also. I’ve been talking against them since

16:58.389 --> 17:05.389
1970 that “Don’t go to these cults. These
are another ego-pampering stuffs.” Suddenly

17:07.199 --> 17:14.199
they start a new idea – it appeals to you.
Suddenly someone says that “No, by leading

17:14.819 --> 17:21.819
this kind of a life you’ll achieve God.”
You accept it. Why not find out? Since ages

17:23.669 --> 17:30.669
people have been writing about the spiritual
life. What does that mean? How to achieve

17:32.340 --> 17:39.340
it? Why do you take to anyone who just says
that “This is so, this is so”? Because

17:40.370 --> 17:47.370
perhaps they have a nice circus or a publicity.
There must be something that is so attractive

17:51.919 --> 17:57.970
that people take to it. Or maybe it is some
sort of a ego-pampering that you want to join

17:57.970 --> 18:01.419
these cults and get destroyed.

18:01.419 --> 18:08.419
There cannot be a cult for your assent. What
cults did you follow to become human beings?

18:14.710 --> 18:21.710
The nature itself works it out. It is a spontaneous
happening. But for a person who lives only

18:23.990 --> 18:28.960
with mental projections, morning till evening
you see television or listen to radio, it’s

18:28.960 --> 18:33.720
nothing but mental projection all the time,
you see, hovering on your head. You cannot

18:33.720 --> 18:39.139
think that there is something beyond that
mental projection which is the reality.

18:39.139 --> 18:46.139
So you find reality horrifying, absolutely
horrifying. You have to pay the tax; you have

18:47.559 --> 18:51.059
to pay the rates; you have to pay this. You
have to be like this; you have to be dressed

18:51.059 --> 18:57.029
up like this; you have to have clothes like
this. All kinds of pressures on your head.

18:57.029 --> 19:03.389
So now what to do? How to get out of this?
This is reality for people.

19:03.389 --> 19:10.389
So then we accept the drugs and the alcohols
and things because we want to get out of it.

19:13.539 --> 19:20.539
That gives definitely a sensation, hallucination;
but reality in itself is so beautiful, is

19:24.909 --> 19:31.909
so surmounting all this, that we have to honestly
understand that if it is reality, it cannot

19:36.679 --> 19:43.679
be hallucination. It cannot. You cannot pay
for it. You cannot follow somebody who says

19:45.389 --> 19:52.389
something against the tradition of evolution.
It has to be fundamental, what it has been

20:00.950 --> 20:07.950
and will be. It has to be something that is
integrating everything, integrating all the

20:09.240 --> 20:14.710
religions, integrating all the religious leaders,
all the great prophets and all the great incarnations,

20:14.710 --> 20:21.710
otherwise it cannot be reality because reality
has to be one. It should unite everything.

20:24.830 --> 20:31.830
It cannot create a separate identity on mental
level. It may create on a spiritual level,

20:37.700 --> 20:44.700
maybe, that people who get Realization, who
have got Self Realization, maybe the people

20:47.519 --> 20:54.519
form a more coordinated concord among themselves,
but they’re all the time worried about the

20:58.789 --> 21:05.789
other people who are not yet in there – not
for money, not for lust, not for greed, but

21:06.330 --> 21:13.330
only because they want to share the joy of
reality.

21:14.279 --> 21:20.230
This has to be first of all understood by
all those who are seeking that reality cannot

21:20.230 --> 21:27.230
be a mental projection, neither can it be
a emotional projection which we can manage

21:28.379 --> 21:33.330
ourselves. One moment we are in love, another
moment we are walking to the divorce cases.

21:33.330 --> 21:40.330
Why? If there was some truth in that kind
of a love, why? It is something beyond, which

21:42.009 --> 21:49.009
is eternal, which doesn’t change, which
overflows, is promised. What about that? Why

21:51.169 --> 21:53.620
not seek that?

21:53.620 --> 22:00.620
Then you turn your eyes to find out where
it is described. Vedas were written thousand

22:05.279 --> 22:12.279
of years back and every Veda, whichever you
read, the Upanishads as they are called as

22:15.149 --> 22:22.149
the people where they have described about
human beings have talked that you have to

22:23.320 --> 22:30.320
worry about your Spirit, it’s the Spirit
that is important. Then you have other people,

22:32.269 --> 22:37.639
in India we had fourteen thousand years back
some great poets. All of them have said the

22:37.639 --> 22:44.639
same. Then we have people in other countries
like Abraham, like Moses, we have Confucius,

22:51.389 --> 22:58.389
Lao Tse. We have Krishna, Rama. All of them
have said one thing, and one thing that “You

23:02.450 --> 23:05.750
seek your Spirit.”

23:05.750 --> 23:12.750
If so, then how? We should again look back.
It is described how to seek it. It is described

23:20.710 --> 23:27.710
in Gita, but much before that it is described
in the Vedas very clearly about the Kundalini

23:29.129 --> 23:36.129
and the seven Chakras. Nobody says in any
book that when the Kundalini awakens you become

23:36.860 --> 23:42.970
mad or you start jumping like a frog.

23:42.970 --> 23:49.970
Recently I went to Pune, and there I was surprised
that the Brahmins of Pune, who are supposed

23:50.350 --> 23:57.350
to be very learned people, were all suffering
from high blood pressure, from kidney troubles,

23:58.110 --> 24:05.110
from insanity. I mean name any disease, they
had it. I said, “Why are they suffering

24:06.120 --> 24:09.899
like this?” So there was one fellow called
[Gumani, Gurumani, or Gulumani ???] Maharaj

24:09.899 --> 24:15.629
who really came as the killer of all these
Brahmins, I think, that they followed him.

24:15.629 --> 24:22.629
And their main person came to discuss with
Me about his religion, so-called.

24:24.440 --> 24:29.049
And he started asking Me, “Do you know about
“terno pai, erno pai”

24:29.049 --> 24:36.049
I said, “What is that? I’ve never heard.
Where is it described?”

24:37.190 --> 24:39.200
‘Oh, You have never heard about it?”

24:39.200 --> 24:39.860
I said, “No.”

24:39.860 --> 24:41.409
“Do You know about shaktipath?”

24:41.409 --> 24:47.090
I said, “I’ve never heard about this.
From where does it come? Which book?”

24:47.090 --> 24:48.509
“Oh, it’s from one book.”

24:48.509 --> 24:49.990
I said, “Which book?”

24:49.990 --> 24:55.690
“About sixty years back there was one Vishnutirth,
Swami Vishnutirth who wrote this book.”

24:55.690 --> 24:57.279
I said, “Really?”

24:57.279 --> 25:02.330
He’s the only one. Only sixty years back
this fellow comes up from somewhere, writes

25:02.330 --> 25:08.809
down something new, “erno pai, terno pai.”
All the Vedas, all the Shastras are all finished.

25:08.809 --> 25:13.460
Bible is finished. Everything is finished.
Only this fellow sixty years back comes up

25:13.460 --> 25:19.309
from somewhere and talks about shaktipath
and you believe it. All of you, the Brahmins,

25:19.309 --> 25:21.440
the educated, the learned.

25:21.440 --> 25:28.440
I said, “Where do you see these words in
the Vedas? Show Me. Where do you see them

25:28.549 --> 25:29.850
in the Patanjali Yoga Shastra? Show Me. Is
it written anywhere? “

25:29.850 --> 25:30.710
He said, “We haven’t read them.”

25:30.710 --> 25:31.639
I said, “What did you read?”

25:31.639 --> 25:32.450
“This Vishnutirtha’s book.”

25:32.450 --> 25:39.450
I said, “You are supposed to be learned
people in Sanskit. You read only this Vishnutirth

25:39.450 --> 25:42.610
who came only sixty years back?”

25:42.610 --> 25:49.610
How can it be? And all of them are so sick
you won’t believe it, and in My presence

25:53.899 --> 25:59.669
when they came they were in a very bad shape,
absolutely in a very bad shape as if they

25:59.669 --> 26:05.389
had taken cocaine or something worse than
that. Eyes were going up, their hands were

26:05.389 --> 26:08.720
moving like this, all kinds of things.

26:08.720 --> 26:12.950
And I told them, “Please forgive Me. Go
to Vishnutirth or to his disciple, this [Gumani,

26:12.950 --> 26:13.200
Gurumani, or Gulumani ???] Maharaj.”

26:12.950 --> 26:19.950
And the only thing they did was not to eat
this, not to eat that, not to have relationship

26:22.759 --> 26:29.759
with your wife, become like a dry bean, live
on a shoe string and then you become godly,

26:34.440 --> 26:39.499
is it? It’s very simple. In India so many
are like that already.

26:39.499 --> 26:46.499
Use your brains! They are very brainy people.

26:46.559 --> 26:51.820
I said, “How could this man dominate you?”

26:51.820 --> 26:57.340
So they came out with very intelligent answer
that “In the Vedas, you see, when we followed

26:57.340 --> 27:00.799
the Vedas and what did we get?”

27:00.799 --> 27:05.570
“All right.” I said, “You didn’t get
anything. But there’s something promised

27:05.570 --> 27:11.370
in the Vedas, in the ancient books, that in
Kali Yuga, at these modern times, you will

27:11.370 --> 27:17.120
get your Realization. Why didn’t you go
for that?”

27:17.120 --> 27:23.559
But this fellow says that through erno pai,
karuno pai - God knows all kinds of nonsensical

27:23.559 --> 27:30.330
words, it has no meaning at all in Sanskrit
language - that you will get your Realization.

27:30.330 --> 27:36.460
All right, anybody says so, must you join
him? You should have asked, “How do you

27:36.460 --> 27:38.549
get these words? From where did you find them?”

27:38.549 --> 27:43.690
You should have asked Mr. Freud, “From where
do you get your knowledge?” He, himself,

27:43.690 --> 27:49.519
was a drug addict. He, himself, was a horrible
man. He had bad relations with his mother.

27:49.519 --> 27:56.519
He had a cancer, and he becomes your guru
instead of Christ? Suddenly, and you accept

27:58.129 --> 27:58.769
him.

27:58.769 --> 28:05.769
Those people who deal on mental level cannot
talk of God. They cannot understand God. God

28:07.999 --> 28:14.999
can be only understood through your Spirit.
Like your theologians here – theologians

28:15.540 --> 28:22.540
– what do they understand about Christ?
They haven’t got power to talk about Christ.

28:26.899 --> 28:33.179
Just because they are elected, they are just
paid servants of the people to look after

28:33.179 --> 28:40.019
the churches, that’s all. They don’t deserve
to be saints. Why are they so important? At

28:40.019 --> 28:47.019
least in India nobody treats them as something
great. They are just priests, finished.

28:47.580 --> 28:54.580
You have to be a saint to understand God.
You have to be a realized soul to understand

28:55.759 --> 29:02.759
His miracles. You cannot just become a theologian
in a theology school or somewhere and start

29:04.249 --> 29:11.249
talking about God. It’s blasphemous the
way these people talk about God and Christ.

29:14.990 --> 29:19.909
I don’t know how you tolerate it. In India
they would have been stoned and finished long

29:19.909 --> 29:26.909
time back. They don’t know what God is,
how can they know about Christ? It has been

29:30.220 --> 29:36.590
on and on from this Augustine time and this
Paul also another horrid fellow. I don’t

29:36.590 --> 29:43.590
know how they call him as Christian, from
where he becomes Christian. And that now they

29:43.629 --> 29:49.110
are not following Christ, they are following
Paul.

29:49.110 --> 29:56.110
Theologians, intellectuals cannot understand
God. He’s beyond your limited intellect;

29:56.860 --> 30:02.869
He’s an unlimited personality. You have
to jump into that. With your limited knowledge

30:02.869 --> 30:09.869
you can play your horses of your politics,
not of God. Such arrogance, such ego! You

30:13.779 --> 30:20.779
are challenging the wrath of God on your countries
when you go about like this.

30:21.879 --> 30:28.879
Please humble down yourself and understand
that God is beyond your petty intellect. First

30:29.659 --> 30:36.659
become your Spirit. You have to become your
Spirit. By reading if you understand God,

30:43.299 --> 30:50.299
then he’s not God. It’s clearly said “Atmanave
Atmana Tattwa”. You see, through the Spirit

30:51.610 --> 30:58.610
you will know God. Christ has said it so clearly
to Nicodemas that “You are to be born of

30:59.440 --> 31:04.090
the Holy Ghost.” And Who is the Holy Ghost?
These people who go to theological colleges,

31:04.090 --> 31:11.090
are they Holy Ghosts or what are they? They
are nothing but ghosts of intellect.

31:11.850 --> 31:18.850
Beware of them. This is another very subtle
attack on reality. And they all will have

31:20.989 --> 31:27.989
to suffer for it, they must understand. You,
those who are seeking, should seek your Spirit

31:31.230 --> 31:38.230
and should understand that you are invited
in the Kingdom of God. The time has come;

31:38.379 --> 31:45.379
this is the judgment time. This is the judgment
and you can see it so clearly.

31:48.929 --> 31:55.929
So there is attack on the seekers. One, from
ignorance because they don’t know what to

31:56.639 --> 32:03.639
seek, how to seek, what to expect; and there
is attack also from outside because they think

32:06.629 --> 32:13.629
you are ignorant, because they think they
know more than what you know. They don’t

32:15.169 --> 32:22.169
know anything about Christ, believe Me - Who
He was, why He came on this Earth, and how

32:24.559 --> 32:31.559
He plays His role so perfectly within ourselves.

32:31.720 --> 32:38.720
I would request you all to receive your Realization
first. There’s no argument about it; there’s

32:40.049 --> 32:47.049
no discussion about it. Even if you try to
argue it out – I may be able to answer you,

32:48.100 --> 32:54.799
but that won’t give you your Realization,
your Kundalini has to rise. Humble down in

32:54.799 --> 32:56.669
your heart.

32:56.669 --> 33:03.669
I went to a village where about three thousand
people came from all hills of Himalayas, very

33:10.659 --> 33:15.419
simple people. And they were waiting for this.

33:15.419 --> 33:20.379
I asked them, “How is it you were waiting?”

33:20.379 --> 33:27.379
“Oh, it is said. It’s said it, that Devi
Jagaran will be there in modern times. We

33:28.710 --> 33:34.759
were waiting for You to come, Mother. Devi
Jagaran is the awakening of the Goddess, of

33:34.759 --> 33:36.309
the Kundalini.

33:36.309 --> 33:43.309
The villages know about it. On the foothill
of Himalayas they are waiting. In one day

33:44.320 --> 33:49.110
I got three thousand people realized. In this
Birmingham, how many people there are today

33:49.110 --> 33:54.239
who are new, who have come to receive their
Realization? Very few. But theologians get

33:54.239 --> 33:59.200
all these lectures. They like to play with
their mental projections.

33:59.200 --> 34:06.200
But beware, time is very short. Better get
your Realization. Become the Spirit and then

34:10.720 --> 34:17.720
you will know that God is not intellect, It
is love. And love which is not limited – unlimited

34:18.770 --> 34:25.770
love which is the most powerful thing in this
universe which you can become aware of and

34:34.970 --> 34:41.889
you can become empowered with that great,
unlimited love which just flows, acts, coordinates,

34:41.889 --> 34:46.869
thinks, plans, works out everything. This
All-Pervading Power about which you have heard,

34:46.869 --> 34:53.869
you have to know That and get It. You can’t
pay for It. You can’t organize It. It has

34:58.700 --> 35:05.700
to work out like a living process within you.

35:09.369 --> 35:14.109
May God bless you.

35:14.109 --> 35:21.109
I would like to know if you have any questions.
[Shri Mataji says aside, “Ice, I don’t

35:30.190 --> 35:37.190
take ice. It is very cold water.]

35:39.569 --> 35:46.569
Come along, come forward. There are lots of
seats here. Who are sitting at the back, come

35:51.670 --> 35:54.040
along. Sit at here.

35:54.040 --> 36:01.040
Can you hear Me? Is it all right? Have you
any questions? Come along, this side. There’s

36:08.020 --> 36:15.020
room this side. Don’t sit on the ground.
There’s room here this side. Any questions?

36:33.099 --> 36:40.099
Question: A man asks if it helps to be a vegetarian.

36:46.780 --> 36:53.780
Shri Mataji: No, no. It has nothing to do
with vegetarianism or not. Christ was not

36:55.270 --> 36:57.569
a vegetarian. It’s all absurdity. Of course
you have to eat whatever suits you. I would

36:57.569 --> 37:04.569
say that – whatever suits you. This vegetarianism
is a fad. It’s just a fad. To believe that

37:06.950 --> 37:13.950
by eating some food you’ll go to God is
a wrong idea. But, of course, alcohol goes

37:16.210 --> 37:20.869
against your awareness, you know that. But
I don’t say, “Don’t take alcohol.”

37:20.869 --> 37:26.410
You will just not take it, that’s all, because
you get the alcohol of God within you and

37:26.410 --> 37:30.010
then you don’t want to take it. That’s
a different point. But I won’t say just

37:30.010 --> 37:31.440
now that “Don’t take it.”

37:31.440 --> 37:38.190
But food has to be seen whatever’s suitable
for your body. I would say that Indians should

37:38.190 --> 37:42.369
take to meat. It would be better. And the
Western people should take to vegetables,

37:42.369 --> 37:49.369
it would be better for them, just to balance.

37:55.450 --> 38:02.450
Question: How do you become your Spirit?

38:16.020 --> 38:23.020
Shri Mataji: That’s a very good question.
That’s the question is - I’m saying it

38:35.200 --> 38:41.490
is a spontaneous happening and that within
us is placed, if you see here in the triangular

38:41.490 --> 38:48.490
bone, is the power of Holy Ghost within us,
which we call in Sanskit language as Kundalini.

38:49.460 --> 38:56.460
In Koran it is called as Assas. In every scripture
it is described. And this Kundalini has to

38:59.890 --> 39:06.890
rise, this power which is the desire power,
which is the pure desire power, because all

39:09.119 --> 39:14.920
other desires are not pure. If they were pure,
then you would have been satisfied. But you’re

39:14.920 --> 39:16.750
not satisfied.

39:16.750 --> 39:23.750
So this pure desire is the desire to become
one with the Spirit. And this is within you,

39:24.690 --> 39:31.230
this force is within you dormantly placed
in the triangular bone called as sacrum. That

39:31.230 --> 39:38.230
means the Greeks also knew the word sacrum
means “sacred.” And this power has to

39:39.319 --> 39:46.319
rise within you, and there are subtle centers
above it, six centers above and one center

39:46.770 --> 39:53.770
below through which it pierces and you feel
the Holy Ghost, which is described by Christ

39:54.770 --> 40:01.770
and you feel the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost
coming out of your fontanel bone area which

40:02.200 --> 40:09.200
is the real baptism. And as a result of that
you start feeling your Spirit in your consciousness,

40:16.280 --> 40:21.710
means in your central nervous system. You,
yourself, feel it.

40:21.710 --> 40:28.710
That’s how you become the Spirit. That’s
the only way it is sprouted. It’s a living

40:35.049 --> 40:42.049
process like if you want to sprout a seed,
you have to embed it into this Mother Earth

40:45.349 --> 40:51.690
and spontaneously with the power what Mother
Earth has, it sprouts. In the same way it

40:51.690 --> 40:58.690
happens, and that’s how I have to work it
out. But later on when you get it and you

40:59.619 --> 41:03.480
become established, you can do it yourself
to others. Like one enlightened light can

41:03.480 --> 41:10.480
enlighten another light. But the first light
has to be enlightened.

41:11.230 --> 41:18.230
For that you can get some books from here,
but once you start reading books also I find

41:18.849 --> 41:25.710
you become more bookish, so it’s better
to postpone the reading for some time. Better

41:25.710 --> 41:32.150
get your Realization first. Like I would say
that when you want to put lights on you say,

41:32.150 --> 41:36.380
“All right, switch on.” It’s all built
in there; it’s all done. Only thing you

41:36.380 --> 41:43.380
have to switch on. And the whole thing becomes
enlightened. But I could first of all tell

41:44.000 --> 41:50.200
you all the details about the history of electricity,
then all the organization that has worked

41:50.200 --> 41:57.200
it out - would be a headache. Better have
your light first.

41:58.890 --> 42:05.890
And then you’ll know all about it. And this
is not I’m saying that is today. Has been

42:10.030 --> 42:17.030
said for thousands of years. That is how we
become the Spirit. Christ didn’t tell us

42:18.069 --> 42:25.069
lies when He said that “You are to be born
of the Holy Ghost.”

42:26.240 --> 42:31.400
He never said that any priest can put his
hand on your head and say, “Now you are

42:31.400 --> 42:38.400
a Christian.” Did He say so? He did not.
That’s all artificial. That’s why children

42:40.250 --> 42:47.130
cry such a lot when they’re baptized, I
think. Like William Blake has said that “A

42:47.130 --> 42:49.220
priest cursed me on my head.”

42:49.220 --> 42:56.220
Any other question, please?

43:09.640 --> 43:16.640
Now we have to work it out. It’s very simple
and it will work out in no time. It works

43:31.750 --> 43:38.750
out. It will happen to you in no time but
the problem is, it’s a new experience and

43:43.230 --> 43:50.230
people actually think that when you get an
experience you must jump or you should become

43:52.190 --> 43:57.859
like a mad person. I don’t know what things
are expected.

43:57.859 --> 44:04.859
You become empowered, and unless and until
you use this power how will you know you’re

44:05.480 --> 44:11.559
empowered or not? So to establish that power
you take some time. Once you have established

44:11.559 --> 44:18.559
that power then you can see yourself how you
are blessed, that how this power is flowing

44:20.650 --> 44:27.650
through you of God’s compassion, that how
you are blessed in every way and how you,

44:31.230 --> 44:38.230
yourself, become the source of joy – to
yourself and to others. How you jump into

44:38.349 --> 44:44.740
a new awareness of collective consciousness
by which you can feel the problems of others

44:44.740 --> 44:50.549
and your own problems, how you can cure your
problems and cure the problems of others.

44:50.549 --> 44:57.549
For this you have to have patience with yourself
for a little while and once you’re established

44:58.809 --> 45:05.809
you will see that you, yourself, become your
own master, your own guru.

45:09.910 --> 45:16.910
So to achieve it, we have to do few things
is to understand that we have to have, first

45:22.020 --> 45:29.020
of all, desire. You and your freedom cannot
be challenged. So you have to have intense

45:30.740 --> 45:37.740
desire to be the Spirit. If you have that
desire in your heart, it works much faster.

45:39.470 --> 45:46.470
To express that symbolically we put the left
hand like this which represents the power

45:47.420 --> 45:54.400
of desire and the right hand is the power
of action. We have to take out our shoes because

45:54.400 --> 45:55.839
the Mother Earth helps us a lot. We have to
take out our shoes to take some help from

45:55.839 --> 45:56.089
Mother Earth. Thank God here it’s not concrete,
slightly better than that.

45:55.839 --> 45:56.950
To put both the feet on the Mother Earth in
a parallel manner, and be comfortable - you

45:56.950 --> 45:57.200
have to be comfortable. Now supposing somebody
is feeling uncomfortable because of something

45:57.170 --> 45:59.760
that’s tight on the neck or on the waist,
please loosen it a little bit if you find

45:59.760 --> 46:00.520
that. But if you’re comfortable, it’s
all right. Or somebody has got a coat which

46:00.520 --> 46:00.980
is making one uncomfortable, you can take
it out.

46:00.980 --> 46:02.849
Attention should not be distracted towards
some discomfort to the body. That is important.

46:02.849 --> 46:09.849
Secondly, if you can take out your spectacles
will be better because here you don’t have

46:11.180 --> 46:17.240
to see anything, you have to keep your eyes
shut.

46:17.240 --> 46:22.250
So please put both your feet on the Mother
Earth, your left hand towards Me like this,

46:22.250 --> 46:22.500
with the desire in the mind that we have to
be the Spirit. We are not yet complete till

46:22.280 --> 46:22.530
we become the Spirit; we are not complete
to understand God Who is absolutely complete.

46:22.299 --> 46:24.170
Now the right hand is to be used for the action.
That is on the different centers we have certain

46:24.170 --> 46:26.780
problems. In a village I don’t have to do
all this. You’ll be surprised, it’s just

46:26.780 --> 46:27.130
like this, (Shri Mataji clicks Her fingers)
just like that. I don’t have to do anything

46:27.130 --> 46:27.420
whatsoever. But we are little complicated
so doesn’t’ matter. We have to remove

46:27.420 --> 46:27.730
our own hurdles by putting our hands into
different things. [Shri Mataji speaks aside

46:27.730 --> 46:28.760
in Hindi] Please put your shoes at the back.
Now, you have to keep your eyes shut, but

46:28.760 --> 46:29.880
before that I’ll tell you the different
centers we’ll try to clear out. One is on

46:29.880 --> 46:30.650
the heart because heart reflects the Spirit.
So that’s why one.

46:30.650 --> 46:33.730
Then secondly we’ll have to put our hand
on the upper part of the abdomen on the left

46:33.730 --> 46:34.480
hand side. The whole thing we are working
out on the left hand side because here resides

46:34.480 --> 46:35.000
the center that governs the mastery. Then
below that is the center that governs the

46:35.000 --> 46:35.250
true knowledge, the pure knowledge.

46:35.170 --> 46:35.579
Then here is the center on the left hand side
which is very important, because this is the

46:35.579 --> 46:35.829
center where when we feel guilty, condemn
ourselves, try to show that we are sinners,

46:35.720 --> 46:35.970
we are good for nothing, a blocket is built
up. And that blocket is very common in the

46:35.890 --> 46:36.140
Western people, surprisingly. Whatever you
may say there is ego, this blocket of feeling

46:36.030 --> 46:36.280
guilty is too much. They all the time feel
guilty for everything that is nonsensical,

46:36.170 --> 46:36.420
or maybe little sensible also, but mostly
nonsensical. So a blocket is built. That’s

46:36.299 --> 46:36.549
how you develop this angina troubles and you
develop other troubles like spondylitis and

46:36.440 --> 46:36.690
all that. So this is a very important point.

46:36.520 --> 46:41.109
At the very outset you must know that you
are not guilty of anything, and God’s power

46:41.109 --> 46:42.619
of forgiveness is so great that He can wash
up whatever wrong you have done. He’s quite

46:42.619 --> 46:42.869
capable. So don’t try to condemn yourself.
Know that you are the temple of God and the

46:42.690 --> 46:42.940
Light has to come within you. That’s all.

46:42.809 --> 46:43.059
So the hand has to be here, push back when
I tell you. Then the hand goes here - is the

46:42.809 --> 46:43.059
center here is very important of Christ which
is in the center of optic chiasma. The center

46:42.809 --> 46:43.059
of Christ is there where you have to forgive
others. At the back is the center where you

46:42.809 --> 46:43.059
have to ask for forgiveness, just to get over
your guilt. And then you have to put your

46:42.950 --> 46:43.200
hand on top of the fontanel bone area which
is the soft bone in your childhood. Put your

46:43.079 --> 46:43.329
palm, just please put it just on top of that.
Stick out your fingers, press it hard and

46:43.079 --> 46:43.329
move it seven times clockwise when I tell
you.

46:43.079 --> 46:43.329
So this is what we have to do ultimately and
then you will see that the Cool Breeze will

46:43.079 --> 46:43.329
be coming out of this fontanel bone area.
You have to certify yourself and then you

46:43.079 --> 46:43.329
start feeling the All Pervading Power of God’s
Love as Cool Breeze around you, on your fingertips.

46:43.079 --> 46:43.329
You have to know on your fingertips. Nobody
else has to certify. You have to certify yourself.

46:43.079 --> 46:43.900
So now first of all we close our eyes. At
the very outset we have to tell ourselves

46:43.900 --> 46:44.289
that we are not guilty.

46:44.289 --> 46:45.059
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi] These
are uprooted people from India so you shouldn’t

46:45.059 --> 46:45.309
worry about them.

46:45.220 --> 46:46.039
Please have your right hand on your heart.
Keep your eyes shut. Please have your right

46:46.039 --> 46:48.039
hand on your heart. On the heart is on the
left hand side above the stomach. Heart. Higher,

46:48.039 --> 46:48.309
it’s higher. Now, at this point you have
to say, or you have to ask Me a question,

46:48.309 --> 46:48.559
in your heart.

46:48.359 --> 46:49.400
“Mother am I the Spirit?” Ask this question
three times. If you want you can call Me “Shri

46:49.400 --> 46:49.650
Mataji” or you can call Me “Mother”,
whatever suits you.

46:49.500 --> 46:49.750
“Mother am I the Spirit? Mother am I the
Spirit?” Ask the question three times.

46:49.670 --> 46:49.920
Now, put this right hand on the left hand
side in the upper part of your abdomen. Please

46:49.859 --> 46:50.109
put this right hand, your fingers, press them
in, on the left hand side, in the upper part

46:50.049 --> 46:50.299
of your abdomen, that is stomach. Now , this
is the center of the mastery. Keep your eyes

46:50.240 --> 46:50.490
shut. Now as you are the Spirit, you are your
own guide.

46:50.359 --> 46:50.609
So now ask the second question, “Mother,
am I my own master?” Three times. “Mother,

46:50.530 --> 46:50.780
am I my own guide?” “Mother, am I my own
guru?” Ask a question within yourselves.

46:50.700 --> 46:50.950
Three times.

46:50.720 --> 46:50.970
After asking this question please don’t
open your eyes, and put your right hand – left

46:50.880 --> 46:52.589
hand to be all the time towards Me and the
right hand in the lower part of your abdomen

46:52.589 --> 46:52.920
on the left hand side. Please put your right
hand in the lower part of your abdomen, your

46:52.920 --> 46:54.339
stomach, on the left side, on the left side.
Press it hard.

46:54.339 --> 46:54.589
Now this is the center of our true knowledge.
As I told you, you are free, I cannot force

46:54.589 --> 46:54.839
things upon you. So please, you have to ask
for it. The true knowledge of Divine Power,

46:54.589 --> 46:54.839
how it works, here you have to ask six times,
“Mother, please may I have the true knowledge,

46:54.589 --> 46:54.839
the true technique? May I have the pure knowledge?”
Ask the question six times, please.

46:54.589 --> 46:54.839
Keep your eyes shut, please. Don’t open
your eyes. Ask this question with full confidence,

46:54.589 --> 46:54.839
please. Keep your eyes shut, please, all of
you.

46:54.589 --> 46:54.839
Now, with your asking the Kundalini starts
getting alert. The Power of Desire wants to

46:54.589 --> 46:54.839
ascend. So you have to make proper seats or
arrangements for the Kundalini’s rise. So

46:54.589 --> 46:54.940
what do you do is to put your hand now on
the upper center that is placed on the left

46:54.940 --> 46:55.190
hand side of your abdomen, in the upper part.
Now, in the upper part of your stomach, on

46:55.000 --> 46:55.250
the left hand side you place your fingers.
Now press them.

46:55.030 --> 46:55.280
Now here you have to say with full confidence,
that the Kundalini wants to rise but you show

46:55.089 --> 46:55.339
your full confidence by saying ten times,
because this center has got ten petals, ten

46:55.140 --> 46:55.390
times. “Mother, I am my master. Mother,
I am my guide. Mother, I am my own guru.”

46:55.190 --> 46:55.440
Please say it with full confidence.

46:55.210 --> 46:55.460
This is the place is created by all the great
masters, satgurus as they are called, within

46:55.260 --> 46:55.510
us. They have to be awakened by this confidence
that you say. Ah. Ten times, please.

46:55.319 --> 46:55.569
[Shri Mataji rubs Her hands together and blows
on Her palms]

46:55.349 --> 46:55.599
Now raise your right hand on to your heart.
On the left hand side it is. Please raise

46:55.410 --> 46:55.660
your right hand on to your heart. Now here,
with full confidence again in yourself, you

46:55.460 --> 46:55.710
have to say, “Mother, I am the Spirit.”
Twelve times. “Mother, I am the Spirit.”

46:55.510 --> 46:55.760
Twelve times. “Mother, I am the Spirit.”
Twelve times. Because you are, but have confidence.

46:55.549 --> 46:55.799
Don’t feel guilty.

46:55.559 --> 46:55.809
As I told you, God is the Ocean of Love. He’s
the Ocean of Compassion, but above all He’s

46:55.619 --> 46:55.869
the Ocean of Forgiveness. With full confidence,
please say, “Mother I am the Spirit” twelve

46:55.670 --> 46:55.920
times.

46:55.670 --> 46:55.920
Now, with full confidence again, put your
hand on your neck on the left hand side from

46:55.730 --> 46:55.980
the front, from the front. Don’t take it
backwards because is easier from the front.

46:55.780 --> 46:56.030
And push it towards the back. Hold it tight,
hold it tight. Here is the problem where you

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
have to know that you are not guilty at all.
Here with full confidence please say sixteen

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
times, “Mother, I am not guilty.” Please
say it sixteen times with full confidence

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
in Me, yourself. You’re not guilty at all.
Believe Me, you’re not guilty of anything

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
– is all conditionings and all kinds of
things, the norms that people have created,

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
is all their mental projections. You’re
not guilty at all. Believe Me. But if you

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
still think you are guilty, you better have
punishment of saying it hundred and eight

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
times.

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
You have to be pleasantly placed because you
have to enter into the Kingdom of God. You

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
have to be pleasant about it. Not to be disgusted.
Now, sixteen times please say, “Mother,

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
I am not guilty at all.” Believe Me you
are not guilty.

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
From your heart please say, “I am not guilty.”
Believe Me. Believe Me.

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
Now, now raise your hand to your forehead
across and press it on both the sides as we

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
do when we have headaches. Now here you have
to say from your heart, from your heart, “Mother,

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
I forgive everyone.” But this is from your
heart. How many times is not the point.

46:56.000 --> 46:56.250
Now some people say that’s difficult to
forgive. But it is again a mental idea that

46:56.210 --> 46:56.460
we forgive someone, or we don’t forgive
someone. Actually, we don’t do anything.

46:56.250 --> 46:56.500
But when we don’t forgive, then we play
into the hands of people who want to do us

46:56.309 --> 46:56.559
harm.

46:56.309 --> 46:56.559
So put your hand on top of your forehead across,
forehead across and say, “Mother, I forgive

46:56.369 --> 46:56.619
everyone” from your heart. Please say it.
You wanted to have your Realization, isn’t

46:56.410 --> 46:56.660
it? Please, go ahead with it. Otherwise then
you’ll say “We didn’t feel it.” Come

46:56.460 --> 46:56.710
along. As you asked the question, please go
ahead. Everybody’s doing it. What’s so

46:56.500 --> 46:56.750
special about you? Just do it. Otherwise you’ll
say, “We didn’t get Realization.” Then

46:56.549 --> 46:56.799
I’m not responsible. You are here to get
your Realization. Be sensible. What are you

46:56.589 --> 46:56.839
going to lose?

46:56.599 --> 46:56.849
If you are seekers, please do it. [Shri Mataji
rubs Her hands together] It’s not proper

46:56.650 --> 46:56.900
that you should watch others. It’s not civil.

46:56.680 --> 46:56.930
Now put your hand on top of your head. Here
– we have missed one center because I don’t

46:56.740 --> 46:56.990
think you need to do that one where you have
to ask for forgiveness – but just put your

46:56.789 --> 46:57.039
hand on top of your head and press it hard
on the fontanel bone area and move it in a

46:56.859 --> 46:57.109
clockwise manner. Here now, again, I cannot
cross your freedom, so you have to say, “Mother,

46:56.910 --> 46:57.160
please give me my Realization.” Seven times.
“Please give me my Realization, I want it.”

46:56.960 --> 46:57.210
I cannot force it.

46:56.970 --> 46:57.220
Place your hand on top of your head, top of
your head, on the top, and press it hard,

46:57.030 --> 46:57.280
and move it. Now, seven times. Now, bring
down your hand, please. Slowly open your eyes.

46:57.079 --> 46:57.329
Slowly open your eyes. Now see, there are
no thoughts in the mind. Just see for yourself.

46:57.130 --> 46:57.380
Watch Me without any thought. Just watch Me.

46:57.160 --> 46:57.410
Put your left hand on top of your head. Left
hand. And right hand towards Me, and see if

46:57.220 --> 46:57.470
there’s a Cool Breeze coming in. Just move
it up and down. It’s very subtle. Here,

46:57.270 --> 46:57.520
here. Here, the fontanel bone is here. All
right? It’s very subtle.

46:57.309 --> 46:57.559
Now, change your hand. Put your left hand
towards Me. See with the right hand. [Shri

46:57.359 --> 46:57.609
Mataji blows into the microphone]

46:57.369 --> 46:57.619
Now change, see it with the other hand. Carefully.
Without thinking. [Shri Mataji blows into

46:57.420 --> 46:57.670
the microphone] Feeling it? There’s a little
breeze coming out. Are you? Little bit here

46:57.470 --> 46:57.720
in front.  
Now, those who are feeling the Cool Breeze,

46:57.500 --> 46:57.750
raise both the hands. Let Me see. Those who
have not felt, should not. You should be honest

46:57.559 --> 46:57.809
about it. All right.

46:57.569 --> 46:57.819
Now, all of you raise your hands and ask a
question, “Is this the Breeze of the Holy

46:57.630 --> 46:57.880
Ghost?’’ Ask a question three times. “Is
this the Breeze of the Holy Ghost?” Now,

46:57.680 --> 46:57.930
put your hands like this. See if It is coming
in your hands also. It’s a very subtle thing.

46:57.740 --> 46:57.990
It’s very subtle. Now, put down your hands
and see are you feeling It in your hands,

46:57.789 --> 46:58.039
some sort of a cool breeze. If you are not
feeling, doesn’t matter. We’ll work it

46:57.839 --> 46:58.089
out. Doesn’t matter. Don’t get upset.
All right?

46:57.869 --> 46:58.119
Now those who have come for the first time,
please raise your hands because people will

46:57.920 --> 46:58.170
come and see you if you are feeling the cool.
First time. Please raise your hands. Are you

46:57.970 --> 46:58.220
feeling the Cool Breeze. No? You are? All
right. Now those who have come for the first

46:58.030 --> 46:58.280
time, please raise your hands because people
would like to see you. All right. Just see.

46:58.079 --> 46:58.329
Now, we have here people who have got Realization,
who are established people and they would

46:58.130 --> 46:58.380
like to see if your chakras are all right
because they’ll just feel your Cool Breeze.

46:58.180 --> 46:58.430
Now the thing is, this is what, exactly what
happened to Christ’s disciples. When they

46:58.230 --> 46:58.480
felt the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, they
started using their hands because the chakras

46:58.280 --> 46:58.530
and all that, they could feel raising of the
Kundalini and they started talking in the

46:58.329 --> 46:58.579
terms of the centers. So people thought they
were mad. Because this is a new language,

46:58.380 --> 46:58.630
a new subject for them. So people thought
they were mad. Exactly the same way you will

46:58.430 --> 46:58.680
also feel everything on your fingertips.

46:58.450 --> 46:58.700
Now, don’t think about it. Again, I would
request you to raise your both the hands those

46:58.510 --> 46:58.760
who have come for the first time so others
could come and feel it, if there is a Cool

46:58.569 --> 46:58.819
Breeze coming out of your head or not. If
it is not coming, doesn’t matter. All of

46:58.619 --> 46:58.869
you who have come for the first time, who
have come for the first time, please raise

46:58.680 --> 46:58.930
your hands. Is important because they will
all take over.

46:58.710 --> 46:58.960
Come along. Forward. You have? You have come
for the first time? All right. You’ve come

46:58.760 --> 46:59.010
before? All right. Doesn’t matter. You raise
your hand. Raise your hand. Also, those who

46:58.809 --> 46:59.059
have not felt the Cool Breeze, raise your
hands. All right.

46:58.839 --> 46:59.089
Can you have a look now? Some of you should
go and see. Now the lady who asked Me a question,

46:58.910 --> 46:59.160
Adita can you see her? She didn’t do anything
and she had neighbors who didn’t do anything

46:58.960 --> 46:59.210
at all. So just see if she’s felt the Cool
Breeze. She has felt it. This lady has come

46:59.020 --> 46:59.270
for the second time, she said. Just see her,
Danny. Liver. Liver. Let her put her right

46:59.079 --> 46:59.329
hand, left hand on the liver.

46:59.089 --> 46:59.339
Now don’t think about it. You cannot think
about it. You try to remain in thoughtless

46:59.150 --> 46:59.400
awareness. [Shri Mataji says aside “ May
God bless you.”] Just see this gentleman

46:59.190 --> 46:59.440
who came for the first time, this gentleman.
Yes. See him, if he’s felt the Cool Breeze

46:59.240 --> 46:59.490
on his head. Now I have to request you one
thing – that, though you have felt it, you

46:59.299 --> 46:59.549
have to establish it. Now don’t waste your
Realization. See these people, all of them,

46:59.349 --> 46:59.599
they have got their Realization, they’re
helping people, that’s how we have to save

46:59.390 --> 46:59.640
this world. And now you will know that what’s
the meaning of your life, why are you here,

46:59.450 --> 46:59.700
what’s the purpose.

46:59.460 --> 46:59.710
Did this gentleman come? You felt it? Still
see him. They have got? He’s got it, you

46:59.510 --> 46:59.760
can see so clearly. Eyes start sparkling.
Hah. Is it better? It’s better now. You

46:59.559 --> 46:59.809
think too much. Don’t you? All right. For
that what is to be done she’ll tell you.

46:59.609 --> 46:59.859
It’s very simple to get rid of it. [Shri
Mataji speaks in Marathi and Hindi]

46:59.660 --> 46:59.910
Just see. Kalab [not sure how to spell this
name], just see him.

46:59.700 --> 46:59.950
There are some new people here? Are there?
Some Sahaj Yogis should come and see this

46:59.750 --> 47:00.000
side. Have you come for the first time? No.
No. You are Sahaj Yogis. Just see here. Some

46:59.809 --> 47:00.059
Sahaj Yogis should come and see there. Come
along. Um. Better? Better. Don’t think.

46:59.849 --> 47:00.099
Just don’t think for awhile. Ah. Is he all
right? Ask him to keep his eyes open. More

46:59.910 --> 47:00.160
on the left. More on the left. Right to the
left you should put it. Right to the left.

46:59.970 --> 47:00.220
Yah. Better. These two ladies here. All right?
Good. How many beautiful people there are

47:00.020 --> 47:00.270
in this world, just see. You have to just
find them. Hah. It’s better with that, very

47:00.069 --> 47:00.319
beautiful, isn’t it? That’s the fact.
That’s the fact. They are beautiful. Ah.

47:00.109 --> 47:00.359
Better. Flowing better. [Shri Mataji talks
in Marathi and Hindi] All right? It’s good.

47:00.160 --> 47:00.410
[more Hindi]

47:00.160 --> 47:00.410
Down below, little. Pat, there’s a gentleman
in front of you here. Just see what about

47:00.220 --> 47:00.470
him. One ahead. Here. No, in there all right.
Yes, this gentleman. Just find out about him.

47:00.270 --> 47:00.520
Yes, please find out. Next to that one.

47:00.289 --> 47:00.539
Did you feel the Cool Breeze? Beg pardon?
What did he say? He didn’t feel it? Should

47:00.349 --> 47:00.599
feel it. What do you say? It’s all right.
Next to that one also. He’s got it. He’s

47:00.410 --> 47:00.660
got it. Keep your eyes open, please. Just
watch Me without thinking. Just watch Me without

47:00.460 --> 47:00.710
thinking. Hah. Better. [Shri Mataji laughs]
Don’t think. Don’t think. With thinking

47:00.490 --> 47:00.740
you cannot be there. This is the first mantra,
first chanting, “Don’t think, don’t

47:00.539 --> 47:00.789
think.” By thinking we reach nowhere. [Shri
Mataji laughs again] It’s maddening, I tell

47:00.579 --> 47:00.829
you.

47:00.589 --> 47:00.839
The lady who asked the question, how is she?
She’s what? Hah. Good? That’s very good,

47:00.640 --> 47:00.890
Ian.

47:00.640 --> 47:00.890
Those who have come today and are not yet
attended to, please raise your hands. Anyone.

47:00.690 --> 47:00.940
Hah. Great. You’ll knock down ten years
at least. Ten years younger, minimum. I am

47:00.740 --> 47:00.990
sixty-three years of age, Myself. I might
be the oldest among all of you. Good? It has

47:00.789 --> 47:01.039
nothing to do with age or anything. Good,
he’s got it, you can see.

47:00.839 --> 47:01.089
These ladies also, they have got it. All right?
Good. Thank you very much, all of you. May

47:00.890 --> 47:01.140
God bless you.
