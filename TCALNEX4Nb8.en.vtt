00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00.310 --> 00:07.143
27th September, 1992

00:31.060 --> 00:36.185
Today is the first day of Navaratri.

00:38.060 --> 00:42.560
And when I found that the rain was there

00:42.893 --> 00:46.560
and all kinds of problems,

00:46.976 --> 00:49.435
and Vishnumaya was suggesting some things,

00:50.477 --> 00:53.560
I just consulted the calendar,

00:54.352 --> 00:58.352
and you will be amazed to know that in the calendar

00:58.727 --> 01:03.602
it is written that till five forty-five it’s not auspicious –

01:04.018 --> 01:05.602
it’s inauspicious.

01:06.185 --> 01:08.393
After five forty-five only

01:13.060 --> 01:15.519
the right thing starts,

01:15.976 --> 01:21.685
so just imagine, by calculation how it was correct

01:22.227 --> 01:29.101
that five forty-five we had to have this puja,

01:29.435 --> 01:31.560
after five forty-five.

01:31.810 --> 01:35.727
That is, the first day of Navaratri starts in Italy

01:35.727 --> 01:39.727
or in Europe after five forty-five.

01:40.143 --> 01:42.602
So it is something one must understand that

01:43.143 --> 01:46.769
the Chaitanya is working out everything,

01:47.060 --> 01:48.810
and it is giving all the suggestions;

01:49.393 --> 01:51.935
because I had not at all seen the, what you call the

01:51.935 --> 01:53.644
tithi (auspicious time),

01:53.644 --> 01:55.602
but I just felt that, I said that we’ll have it

01:55.810 --> 01:57.060
in the evening.

01:57.393 --> 01:59.060
And when I said it, I said “Let’s see this,”

01:59.060 --> 02:01.101
and there it was.

02:01.769 --> 02:04.227
There’s so many things we have to see,

02:05.809 --> 02:12.018
that whatever has been revealed to you, you can verify it.

02:12.809 --> 02:15.809
For example, I had said long time back

02:16.602 --> 02:21.268
that Mooladhara Chakra is made out of carbon,

02:21.602 --> 02:23.227
carbon atom,

02:23.893 --> 02:31.477
and if you see it from left to the right – right to the left,

02:32.018 --> 02:38.060
left side you see nothing but a swastika.

02:39.060 --> 02:42.809
So, now you see from left to the right,

02:43.352 --> 02:46.185
then you see Omkara;

02:46.560 --> 02:49.477
and once you see from down below upward,

02:50.435 --> 02:54.976
you see the alpha and omega.

02:55.602 --> 02:57.810
Now see, Christ has said that

02:58.227 --> 03:03.018
“I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

03:03.352 --> 03:06.893
So this swastika becomes Omkara,

03:07.268 --> 03:12.060
also becomes Christ.

03:13.727 --> 03:14.935
You can see it very clearly.

03:15.185 --> 03:19.685
Now we have got a beautiful picture of that,

03:20.310 --> 03:23.185
we have a tape, and I wanted to see you all that,

03:23.519 --> 03:25.769
but I don’t know how we can manage here.

03:25.769 --> 03:29.227
But I wish you all could see it, it’s so clear-cut.

03:29.477 --> 03:34.976
So alpha and omega, also these mathematical things

03:35.976 --> 03:39.268
have come to us from

03:41.810 --> 03:45.060
inside, from the Divine.

03:45.477 --> 03:47.393
This is not we have created.

03:47.810 --> 03:53.851
This was found out by some mathematicians

03:54.268 --> 03:56.268
who were realized souls,

03:56.727 --> 04:00.310
and they used this alpha and omega.

04:00.810 --> 04:04.644
It’s surprising how it shows so clearly that

04:04.976 --> 04:07.018
swastika becoming Omkar,

04:07.310 --> 04:12.018
and Omkar then becoming alpha and omega.

04:12.435 --> 04:18.268
So everything in Sahaja Yoga is tangible and

04:18.602 --> 04:21.143
can be verified.

04:21.810 --> 04:28.310
Now you are worshipping today the Durga,

04:28.810 --> 04:32.976
or all the nine forms of the Goddess.

04:33.851 --> 04:38.769
She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that

04:39.810 --> 04:44.435
She fought all the people who were destroying

04:45.060 --> 04:47.435
the seekers,

04:47.769 --> 04:53.268
who were trying to make a mess of their lives.

04:54.101 --> 04:59.602
And these tortured saints,

05:00.060 --> 05:03.393
when they prayed to the Goddess – because none of the

05:03.809 --> 05:11.435
gods could do anything, and Sadashiva is never interfering

05:11.727 --> 05:14.268
with what the Goddess is doing –

05:14.644 --> 05:17.685
so they worshipped the Bhagawati,

05:18.227 --> 05:22.352
and then the incarnation of Hers came nine times,

05:22.685 --> 05:26.769
according to the need of the time.

05:28.018 --> 05:31.101
So every time you find Her confronting people who are

05:31.435 --> 05:34.727
extremely arrogant, self-opinionated,

05:35.227 --> 05:38.602
thinking no end of themselves;

05:39.060 --> 05:44.185
and the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated

05:44.727 --> 05:48.018
horrible rakshasas.

05:48.310 --> 05:51.644
Now, in India when we cast the horoscope of a person,

05:51.644 --> 05:53.810
we have three categories of people:

05:54.101 --> 05:56.851
one are the devas, they’re called dev;

05:58.310 --> 06:02.560
the second ones are the ones which are manavas,

06:02.893 --> 06:04.851
means human beings;

06:05.101 --> 06:07.018
and the third ones are rakshasas.

06:08.143 --> 06:13.560
So I think I have got all of you from the dev categories,

06:13.809 --> 06:15.685
because you could not have taken to Sahaja Yoga

06:16.143 --> 06:18.810
that seriously unless and until you were there.

06:19.143 --> 06:22.185
After all, why should you believe Me also that

06:22.477 --> 06:25.143
when I say that there was the Durga, and there was

06:25.477 --> 06:29.519
this thing, and She did this and did that?

06:29.935 --> 06:33.935
It’s not that from one faith you have come out and now

06:34.185 --> 06:36.935
you are jumping onto another faith; it’s not like that.

06:37.185 --> 06:42.769
It is actually been proved – you can feel.

06:43.018 --> 06:45.893
For example, when you are raising the Kundalini

06:46.185 --> 06:48.602
on the center Heart,

06:49.143 --> 06:51.976
you can feel

06:52.352 --> 06:55.477
that on the center Heart if there is a catch,

06:55.809 --> 06:59.143
you have to take name of the Jagadamba.

06:59.935 --> 07:03.477
Unless and until you take Her name it won’t open out.

07:03.727 --> 07:06.769
Also when I am clearing out your center Heart,

07:07.143 --> 07:12.769
I have to also say, “Now I am in reality Jagadamba,”

07:13.060 --> 07:17.685
and then the Jagadamba within you awakens.

07:17.935 --> 07:20.352
So now you have verified it much more

07:20.685 --> 07:22.769
than the scientists have done.

07:22.769 --> 07:26.018
The scientists are going from outside,

07:26.435 --> 07:28.101
and they are not conclusive at all.

07:28.435 --> 07:30.976
Now if you have one problem, they will work it out;

07:31.435 --> 07:33.352
another problem – they work out problems,

07:33.685 --> 07:36.477
but they don’t know the basics,

07:36.809 --> 07:40.935
what the problems are, and where lies the solution.

07:41.352 --> 07:48.644
While you can see that once the Amba, this Kundalini

07:49.268 --> 07:53.101
who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

07:53.519 --> 07:56.185
of the Adi Shakti within you,

07:56.644 --> 08:01.477
when She rises through these different chakras,

08:02.018 --> 08:05.101
She gives them power because She’s the Power,

08:05.477 --> 08:07.101
She’s the Shakti.

08:07.560 --> 08:12.227
She is the desire power of Sadashiva.

08:13.809 --> 08:17.477
She is the complete power of Sadashiva.

08:18.018 --> 08:21.727
And so She gives the power totally to every chakra,

08:22.018 --> 08:25.393
by which all these chakras are enlightened

08:25.769 --> 08:28.060
and all the deities are awakened.

08:28.519 --> 08:32.185
Supposing we have no power of life,

08:32.519 --> 08:34.809
we’ll be like dead people.

08:35.644 --> 08:38.976
So these centers when they receive this power,

08:39.310 --> 08:42.101
this Shakti, then they are awakened.

08:42.352 --> 08:45.310
Now you have seen it, you can do it yourself.

08:45.602 --> 08:47.435
It’s all tangible,

08:47.851 --> 08:50.893
you can verify it.

08:51.685 --> 08:57.602
I have told you that She resides on the Heart center.

08:57.893 --> 09:00.519
Now see how Heart center is placed –

09:00.519 --> 09:02.519
also very interesting to see.

09:03.268 --> 09:08.976
While She is Jagadamba; but the Amba, means the pure

09:09.310 --> 09:15.769
form of power, resides in the triangular bone,

09:16.060 --> 09:18.101
like Kundalini.

09:18.519 --> 09:21.560
But Her form which is Jagadamba,

09:22.018 --> 09:26.352
where She is the Mother of the Universe,

09:26.727 --> 09:30.727
She resides on the Heart center.

09:31.352 --> 09:35.352
Now this Heart center is very important.

09:36.227 --> 09:40.602
When – I have already told you this, that when a child

09:40.935 --> 09:45.435
is about, till the twelve years of age,

09:45.851 --> 09:51.310
this center produces the ganas.

09:52.185 --> 09:57.685
Ganas are the workers on the left-hand side.

09:58.060 --> 10:03.227
They are like, we can say St. Michael is their leader,

10:03.769 --> 10:12.477
but their king is Ganapati, Ganesha.

10:14.727 --> 10:19.310
So first She has done is the ghatasthapana.

10:19.602 --> 10:22.644
“Ghatasthapana” means – you have done here now,

10:22.851 --> 10:26.143
this is the ghatasthapana (pot with coconut)

10:26.143 --> 10:28.185
This is the kumbha.

10:28.727 --> 10:31.143
Now this kumbha She has established first:

10:31.393 --> 10:33.018
that is the triangular bone.

10:33.018 --> 10:37.143
Now this is Her first work, that to establish this,

10:37.769 --> 10:39.769
your Mooladhara.

10:40.185 --> 10:44.060
So She established within you is innocence.

10:44.393 --> 10:47.769
She established innocence within you to begin with.

10:48.060 --> 10:53.185
So She has put this ghata in which She is staying

10:53.477 --> 10:55.227
as Kundalini now.

10:55.602 --> 11:00.685
So the first is that to establish the Kundalini

11:01.060 --> 11:05.809
in the triangular bone, and then to establish Shri Ganesha.

11:06.060 --> 11:11.352
This is the first work, by which whatever She is going

11:11.769 --> 11:15.560
to create now –

11:15.893 --> 11:20.685
all the Universes, the Earth, everything –

11:21.101 --> 11:24.893
whatever She is going to create has to be filled with

11:25.268 --> 11:27.810
innocence.

11:28.060 --> 11:32.602
Now if you see the stones,

11:32.935 --> 11:35.393
they’re innocent.

11:36.268 --> 11:37.976
If you hit the stone you’ll get the hit,

11:38.268 --> 11:41.060
otherwise it doesn’t come up and hit you.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.519
They’re innocent.

11:44.393 --> 11:51.227
If you see the rivers, they’re innocent.

11:52.851 --> 11:57.560
Everything that has been created as matter is innocent.

11:58.143 --> 12:02.560
It is not cunning, it is not manipulating,

12:02.935 --> 12:05.810
it is not aggressive – nothing of the kind.

12:06.268 --> 12:07.352
They’re innocent,

12:07.727 --> 12:12.268
means they’re under the complete order of God Almighty.

12:12.519 --> 12:14.519
They do not have their own free will to do what they like.

12:17.851 --> 12:23.685
Whatever is done is with the absolutely under complete

12:24.060 --> 12:27.060
command of God Almighty,

12:27.393 --> 12:31.310
and so they are, we can say they’re innocent,

12:31.769 --> 12:36.893
because they have no free will to do what they like.

12:37.310 --> 12:42.101
So then if you see the animals also,

12:42.435 --> 12:47.143
they also are innocent, except for very few.

12:47.477 --> 12:50.727
Most of them are innocent, innocent in the sense that

12:51.143 --> 12:55.018
they are called as “pashu”– means they are completely

12:55.310 --> 12:58.727
under the control, pasha, of God Almighty.

12:58.976 --> 13:02.268
A tiger will behave like a tiger,

13:02.976 --> 13:05.393
and a snake will behave like a snake.

13:05.769 --> 13:09.519
But in human beings somebody will behave like a tiger,

13:09.893 --> 13:13.851
tomorrow like a snake and third day like a worm.

13:14.227 --> 13:16.227
There’s no steadiness.

13:16.602 --> 13:19.560
For this you cannot say that this gentleman is today tiger,

13:19.810 --> 13:21.976
so tomorrow he will not be a snake.

13:22.352 --> 13:27.935
They have no free will to change their individuality.

13:28.727 --> 13:30.769
They are left alone.

13:31.185 --> 13:34.519
So that is not the job of the Shakti to bother.

13:34.810 --> 13:37.185
That’s already been created, they are there,

13:37.519 --> 13:40.393
and they are existing.

13:41.060 --> 13:44.101
They have a purpose, that’s why they are there;

13:44.519 --> 13:48.519
and the purpose is only one, is to support human beings,

13:48.851 --> 13:51.809
because you are at the epitome of evolution.

13:52.227 --> 13:57.560
So She has created all these things just for you

13:57.851 --> 14:04.268
to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization;

14:04.602 --> 14:06.477
to have meaning for your life,

14:06.727 --> 14:08.602
to get connected to this all-pervading Power,

14:09.018 --> 14:12.060
to enter into the Kingdom of God.

14:12.477 --> 14:14.060
All is Her work.

14:14.644 --> 14:18.644
So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time

14:18.935 --> 14:22.769
She is supposed to give Realization to all of you.

14:23.560 --> 14:27.935
But at the tenth time, all these three powers are

14:28.268 --> 14:31.393
joined together – that’s why it’s called Trigunatmika.

14:31.685 --> 14:33.352
That’s why Buddha has said “Matreya”–

14:33.644 --> 14:37.519
means three Mothers put together.

14:38.060 --> 14:43.310
So this Power when it starts acting, it has the complete

14:43.727 --> 14:50.809
control over all your three channels and seven centers –

14:51.185 --> 14:53.227
complete control,

14:53.851 --> 14:59.352
as if without the permission or without the taking

14:59.602 --> 15:05.809
the name of this Power, you cannot achieve anything.

15:07.519 --> 15:09.227
Is a fact,

15:09.602 --> 15:12.477
and that is where human beings fail,

15:12.727 --> 15:14.644
because they have a free will,

15:14.935 --> 15:18.268
and they don’t know why to obey anyone or why to listen

15:18.602 --> 15:21.935
to anyone, and why to accept anyone.

15:22.519 --> 15:27.769
That’s why, though you have to be given Self-realization,

15:28.060 --> 15:30.185
the task is very difficult;

15:31.101 --> 15:34.809
because you are not used to

15:35.352 --> 15:38.809
a way where you don’t have to use your free will.

15:39.769 --> 15:41.769
Specially in the Western countries,

15:41.976 --> 15:46.310
people have choices even for their cereals.

15:46.560 --> 15:52.727
I was told that in America there are 126 types of cereals.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.268
This kind of nonsense if you are doing,

15:56.519 --> 16:01.477
your ego definitely bloats out, and you think

16:01.809 --> 16:07.268
that “We have a right to decide for ourself.”

16:07.644 --> 16:10.560
And you cannot accept somebody who can tell you that

16:11.101 --> 16:13.851
this is not right, and this is not right.

16:14.268 --> 16:22.352
So the same Power has now been awakened in

16:22.809 --> 16:24.769
the Paramachaitanya.

16:25.352 --> 16:28.227
Now, this awakening into the Paramachaitanya is doing

16:28.602 --> 16:32.602
marvellous work, which you can see clearly.

16:33.018 --> 16:36.685
Firstly, you have seen My photographs.

16:37.268 --> 16:39.268
You see My photographs, you are stunned,

16:39.519 --> 16:42.352
you are surprised. I mean,

16:42.602 --> 16:45.644
I Myself don’t know what is this Paramachaitanya

16:45.935 --> 16:47.602
is busy with.

16:47.851 --> 16:51.810
It is so activated that all the time it is working out

16:52.185 --> 16:58.185
to convince you people about the truth.

16:58.519 --> 17:02.060
If it was so active at the time of Christ,

17:02.310 --> 17:04.352
would have been much better.

17:04.352 --> 17:07.101
But it had to be this way, because human beings are

17:07.352 --> 17:11.393
the most difficult things to manage.

17:11.727 --> 17:15.268
They have been given freedom; that too,

17:15.519 --> 17:16.809
you’d be amazed,

17:17.143 --> 17:20.935
that the freedom was given to Adam and Eve,

17:21.185 --> 17:22.519
but how it was achieved,

17:22.519 --> 17:24.143
we should understand this.

17:24.519 --> 17:26.851
In the Gnostics Bible it has come out what I’ve been

17:27.143 --> 17:33.685
saying, that Adam and Eve, both of them

17:34.935 --> 17:40.310
were like pashus, under the complete control of God –

17:40.644 --> 17:42.018
no free will.

17:42.352 --> 17:48.809
They would have lived in the nude in the garden of Eden,

17:49.101 --> 17:53.893
would not have even thought of knowing anything

17:54.143 --> 17:58.143
more than that, but to eat, live like animals.

17:58.393 --> 18:00.893
They were just like animals.

18:01.185 --> 18:06.435
Then it is the Shakti itself took the form of a snake,

18:06.810 --> 18:08.060
and went and told them that

18:08.393 --> 18:11.435
“You must have the fruit of Knowledge.”

18:11.810 --> 18:14.101
She wanted to evolve.

18:14.101 --> 18:17.519
That was not the idea of God Almighty,

18:17.810 --> 18:19.519
because it’s quite a headache, you know,

18:19.769 --> 18:22.310
to do such a thing.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.352
He thought, “What is the need to have

18:24.602 --> 18:27.101
such headaches around Me?”

18:27.602 --> 18:30.685
But Shakti knew Her own style.

18:30.893 --> 18:35.935
She knew that She is capable of lots of miracles,

18:36.352 --> 18:40.143
and She can make these human beings understand

18:40.393 --> 18:43.435
the Knowledge, and She can really make them

18:43.810 --> 18:46.644
knowledgeable.

18:46.976 --> 18:49.185
So She said, “You must eat this fruit,

18:49.560 --> 18:56.685
and you must try to know the Knowledge.”

18:57.809 --> 19:04.018
So a new type of human race started,

19:04.685 --> 19:09.477
which wanted to know what is the Knowledge.

19:09.727 --> 19:12.810
You have seen that we had all kinds

19:13.143 --> 19:15.727
of primitive people before.

19:16.060 --> 19:19.143
Then they started evolving, evolving.

19:19.519 --> 19:23.143
Now, I have to say that

19:23.810 --> 19:29.685
the first creation which took place before that,

19:31.227 --> 19:34.893
there were other higher creations

19:40.185 --> 19:44.644
which were planned by Adi Shakti

19:45.101 --> 19:48.893
to plan out the whole thing.

19:49.227 --> 19:51.893
So She created Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha,

19:52.227 --> 19:58.560
and She created their lokas, their atmospheres or you can

19:58.810 --> 20:02.477
say their areas.

20:02.727 --> 20:04.143
In that all the planning was done,

20:04.477 --> 20:08.935
how we can achieve this to make these animals realized

20:09.185 --> 20:12.143
souls, from animal to human beings,

20:12.435 --> 20:15.810
and from human beings to realized souls.

20:16.185 --> 20:18.810
It was a very big problem.

20:19.101 --> 20:22.809
That’s how they created, you see – as you know that

20:23.101 --> 20:24.685
Vishnu had His own loka,

20:24.893 --> 20:26.435
Mahesha had His own loka,

20:26.685 --> 20:29.310
and Brahmadeva had His own loka.

20:29.560 --> 20:33.602
And they decided among themselves how best we can do it.

20:33.602 --> 20:37.101
Because these three channels were created in human

20:37.352 --> 20:39.268
beings later on.

20:39.268 --> 20:43.519
Out of the three channels came out these three Shaktis:

20:43.809 --> 20:45.769
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

20:46.060 --> 20:49.185
They produced two children,

20:49.477 --> 20:51.644
one shakti and one the brother,

20:52.018 --> 20:54.143
and then intermarriage and all that took place,

20:54.393 --> 20:58.435
in a way – marriage not in the human way,

20:58.769 --> 21:01.769
not in the human way we should say, but they were,

21:02.227 --> 21:07.477
the energy was given to the potential man.

21:07.851 --> 21:11.143
So the woman, who was the energy representing,

21:11.560 --> 21:14.018
was given to a man.

21:15.935 --> 21:17.810
All these things happened,

21:18.519 --> 21:24.644
and they chose to work it out in human beings.

21:25.101 --> 21:29.018
It happened like this, that the first working

21:29.435 --> 21:33.727
somehow or other was very effective in India.

21:34.143 --> 21:36.893
Or maybe they chose India because Indian climate

21:37.352 --> 21:38.393
is so good.

21:39.018 --> 21:40.644
I mean, you know definitely there are six seasons.

21:40.644 --> 21:42.018
It’s not like this anytime,

21:42.352 --> 21:46.227
like this irrational rain comes in, like London

21:46.602 --> 21:47.809
you have to play football also with

21:47.809 --> 21:50.393
an umbrella on your head!

21:52.393 --> 21:55.769
So there are exactly six seasons in India,

21:56.060 --> 21:58.143
and they are so well balanced.

21:58.519 --> 22:04.769
That’s why this Paramachaitanya is also called as

22:04.769 --> 22:08.393
“Ritambhara pragya” in India – not here,

22:08.727 --> 22:10.519
we cannot say.

22:10.769 --> 22:12.435
“Ritambhara pragya” means the one

22:12.727 --> 22:15.935
which is the Knowledge, pragya,

22:16.310 --> 22:20.560
means the one enlightened Knowledge,

22:20.809 --> 22:24.310
of the one which makes seasons.

22:24.935 --> 22:29.477
Because here ritambhara pragya is in a doldrum.

22:29.810 --> 22:31.893
It’s not at all understanding,

22:32.352 --> 22:34.644
because of the human beings as they are.

22:35.060 --> 22:38.976
They are so much scatterbrain, I should say,

22:39.435 --> 22:42.727
that even the nature has become scatterbrain here,

22:43.060 --> 22:45.227
and cannot understand how to deal with such human

22:45.769 --> 22:47.560
beings – is a fact.

22:47.976 --> 22:50.685
But in India it is the six seasons are there,

22:51.060 --> 22:54.809
and these six seasons are absolutely known.

22:56.560 --> 23:01.268
One has not studied the astrology of India,

23:01.602 --> 23:03.935
but they have their own astrology –

23:04.268 --> 23:05.935
of course, I don’t believe in it.

23:06.352 --> 23:10.893
But the, at the level of a human level

23:11.227 --> 23:13.477
you can see how they depict

23:13.893 --> 23:16.810
and how they can exactly say when it will rain,

23:17.268 --> 23:21.060
when it will not rain; what will happen, that will happen.

23:21.602 --> 23:24.477
Even about the stars, that such a star will be coming.

23:24.477 --> 23:27.101
Now this has been done in thousands of years back.

23:27.435 --> 23:28.644
They will exactly say

23:28.644 --> 23:30.809
what time which star will be coming nearer,

23:31.060 --> 23:32.809
what star are today governing,

23:33.477 --> 23:35.143
tomorrow what will be the star there.

23:35.685 --> 23:39.976
In those olden days they had studied all these things.

23:40.477 --> 23:43.352
When I see here, I don’t know what was the situation

23:43.727 --> 23:46.477
at that time in these Western countries,

23:46.935 --> 23:50.018
whether there were human beings or not I don’t know;

23:50.393 --> 23:56.435
but historically I think it was not such a developed place.

23:57.644 --> 24:03.185
So then all this arrangement was made,

24:03.185 --> 24:08.018
and human beings were made to understand

24:08.352 --> 24:11.893
that there is God.

24:13.268 --> 24:17.477
The saints were respected – I’m telling you in India –

24:17.810 --> 24:19.644
real saints were respected,

24:20.018 --> 24:24.602
and they made different observations.

24:24.935 --> 24:28.602
Now when I read say, Adi Shankaracharya,

24:28.976 --> 24:32.727
I am amazed how he knows so many things about Me.

24:33.101 --> 24:35.935
He knows how My knee looks like,

24:36.227 --> 24:39.519
he knows how many lines I have on My back,

24:39.851 --> 24:42.851
how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man

24:43.185 --> 24:46.352
knows everything about Me.

24:46.602 --> 24:48.602
That means through his meditative power he could

24:49.018 --> 24:51.602
envisage Me – he never saw Me.

24:52.018 --> 24:55.393
The description and everything is so clear-cut.

24:55.809 --> 24:59.352
Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess,

24:59.809 --> 25:04.393
thousand names of the Goddess are so precise.

25:04.727 --> 25:08.060
I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that.

25:08.393 --> 25:11.560
Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me

25:11.810 --> 25:14.393
is there, is a fact.

25:14.935 --> 25:18.185
And it is the Knowledge of these people

25:18.519 --> 25:21.893
is most remarkable: how did they know that

25:22.227 --> 25:24.809
a Goddess is like that?

25:25.101 --> 25:28.143
Certain of My things which I also don’t know,

25:28.143 --> 25:32.851
but they are there, and they have described.

25:33.519 --> 25:34.976
It’s very surprising.

25:35.435 --> 25:37.976
So their meditative power in India was great.

25:38.352 --> 25:43.310
The reason was, our seasons were disciplined,

25:43.769 --> 25:46.101
people are disciplined.

25:46.560 --> 25:48.602
In India most of the people get up early in the morning,

25:48.851 --> 25:51.435
do their pujas, everything, take their baths,

25:51.893 --> 25:56.352
and they go for work, come home, be with the family, have

25:56.685 --> 26:01.060
their food, and then sing some songs and bhajans,

26:01.352 --> 26:05.018
and then sleep off – normally.

26:05.644 --> 26:07.393
Very disciplined.

26:07.727 --> 26:09.809
They don’t go on holidays,

26:10.143 --> 26:12.727
they don’t get into drinking and things like that.

26:13.018 --> 26:16.352
Normally in the family, no question, if somebody drinks

26:16.644 --> 26:18.769
he’s thrown out of the house.

26:19.185 --> 26:22.143
He’s condemned as a leper.

26:22.519 --> 26:26.435
He’s called as a daruda, means he is a drunkard.

26:27.435 --> 26:30.310
And even nowadays some people are drinking,

26:30.935 --> 26:35.477
but they too, they hide their drinking.

26:35.851 --> 26:38.310
Nobody drinks in the presence of others.

26:38.809 --> 26:41.893
I mean, I don’t know, their influence might increase

26:42.143 --> 26:44.477
and people will start openly drinking,

26:44.810 --> 26:47.809
but normally they don’t.

26:48.727 --> 26:51.893
So because of these six seasons being absolutely in

26:52.227 --> 26:58.185
discipline, we knew what to do when, and how to do it.

26:58.602 --> 27:03.268
Now, people could live in the jungles.

27:03.644 --> 27:06.268
Like in England, if you have to go out it takes fifteen,

27:06.519 --> 27:09.060
twenty minutes: you have to wear your shoes, socks,

27:09.519 --> 27:12.809
your coat, your under- this thing, that thing;

27:13.101 --> 27:15.851
otherwise you can’t get out.

27:16.185 --> 27:18.227
And you start from one place; reaching another place

27:18.602 --> 27:21.268
you’ll find it is raining heavily, you have nothing,

27:21.560 --> 27:23.685
you get drenched.

27:24.268 --> 27:27.143
But this is not so in India.

27:27.393 --> 27:30.268
It’s so balanced that when you come, all of you come

27:30.519 --> 27:32.644
in winter-time, you have seen it.

27:33.018 --> 27:35.893
It doesn’t rain suddenly, it doesn’t happen like that

27:36.185 --> 27:37.810
at a wrong time.

27:38.060 --> 27:40.935
You can stay outside as long as you want.

27:41.560 --> 27:44.101
So these people could live in the jungles,

27:44.393 --> 27:48.851
in the sense we didn’t have so much idea of comfort at all.

27:48.851 --> 27:52.227
In a simple little hut they could live:

27:52.602 --> 27:54.268
a little protection from the sun,

27:54.685 --> 27:58.602
and protection from the rain for rainy season,

27:58.893 --> 28:00.185
that’s all.

28:01.602 --> 28:04.893
And they had very little needs of life.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.143
And we didn’t use plastics – I mean,

28:07.393 --> 28:09.602
there were no plastics that time, or even now

28:09.810 --> 28:12.268
we don’t use plastics.

28:12.644 --> 28:16.810
And we used to have few thalis and things.

28:17.143 --> 28:20.310
In a small family also they’ll have just thalis,

28:20.644 --> 28:24.976
which were just permanently with the family.

28:25.393 --> 28:28.769
Now I find that such a difference there is.

28:28.769 --> 28:31.935
You see, in simple living what happens,

28:32.477 --> 28:37.727
that you do not take out

28:38.018 --> 28:40.268
all the wealth from the Mother Earth.

28:40.644 --> 28:42.769
There’s no ecological problem there.

28:43.268 --> 28:47.185
But by having as you are saying so many glasses for this,

28:47.560 --> 28:50.227
so many glasses for that, all this kind of thing that you

28:50.519 --> 28:56.560
produce has no aesthetic value, and has no durability.

28:56.893 --> 28:59.809
So then you have mountains and mountains of these huge

29:00.185 --> 29:03.352
big plastics which cannot be burnt, which cannot be

29:03.602 --> 29:07.976
thrown away, if you throw away in the sea it floats,

29:08.352 --> 29:11.018
and such problems are there.

29:11.519 --> 29:15.268
So this Shakti that was working in those days

29:15.519 --> 29:20.851
was in them to make them seekers;

29:21.477 --> 29:24.268
because they didn’t have to do anything else, you know.

29:24.268 --> 29:26.519
It’s all right, you have food to eat,

29:26.809 --> 29:28.060
you have place to sleep,

29:28.060 --> 29:31.685
finished – not much to be done,

29:31.976 --> 29:34.310
living so happily.

29:34.685 --> 29:37.435
With all these

29:38.477 --> 29:43.393
comforts in the way that so little a demand on your time,

29:43.809 --> 29:45.644
they had time, lot of time.

29:46.143 --> 29:50.935
And with that time, what did they do?

29:51.310 --> 29:55.727
They didn’t go, say, for that, for a swimming or

29:56.143 --> 29:59.393
ballroom dancing, or nothing of the kind.

29:59.769 --> 30:02.769
With that time they meditated.

30:03.101 --> 30:05.809
And when that time meditation started,

30:06.352 --> 30:11.560
then they started realizing what is the divine Power,

30:11.893 --> 30:15.018
what is Divinity, what is God.

30:15.560 --> 30:18.352
For example I’ll tell you, here people discuss even

30:18.685 --> 30:22.227
the private life of Christ, and say all kinds of things;

30:22.519 --> 30:25.602
I mean, it’s impossible in India, nobody does that.

30:25.935 --> 30:28.935
It never comes to their head that

30:29.352 --> 30:31.644
how Krishna had sixteen thousand wives –

30:31.851 --> 30:34.310
must be some reason, He is God after all. God is God,

30:34.644 --> 30:38.185
youare a human being – how can you know about God,

30:38.435 --> 30:40.268
because you have come through Him?

30:40.644 --> 30:42.644
They don’t discuss such nonsensical things,

30:42.851 --> 30:43.685
must be that.

30:44.435 --> 30:46.352
And now when I told them these are His powers,

30:46.644 --> 30:48.352
sixteen thousand, they said, “Yes.”

30:49.185 --> 30:51.435
Then, the five wives were the five elements – “Yes.”

30:51.769 --> 30:53.976
They are God.

30:54.227 --> 30:55.809
Nobody discusses these things.

30:55.809 --> 30:58.477
God is – how can you understand God?

30:58.727 --> 31:01.143
Can you understand Me? You can’t.

31:01.393 --> 31:04.727
Try – you can’t understand Me.

31:04.727 --> 31:06.809
Very difficult.

31:07.185 --> 31:09.477
So you can’t understand,

31:09.893 --> 31:11.310
you can’t understand God.

31:11.769 --> 31:13.268
Please understand one thing,

31:13.644 --> 31:16.727
that for to understand God is an impossibility.

31:17.101 --> 31:18.769
But you can be in connection with God,

31:19.310 --> 31:20.851
you can be in the company of God,

31:21.519 --> 31:22.809
you can be blessed by God,

31:23.310 --> 31:25.185
you can be looked after by God,

31:25.644 --> 31:27.976
you can know lots of things about God;

31:28.352 --> 31:32.352
but you cannot understand.

31:33.602 --> 31:37.101
This is another thing one has to know,

31:37.560 --> 31:41.143
that you cannot understand why God does these things,

31:41.519 --> 31:44.018
why He does this, why He does that.

31:44.352 --> 31:47.060
You cannot understand, you cannot explain it.

31:47.602 --> 31:49.143
I mean, somebody can even say here,

31:49.143 --> 31:51.143
“Why did He make swastika?”

31:51.477 --> 31:53.060
Then, “Why did He make Omkara?”

31:53.435 --> 31:55.769
I mean here the people are so arrogant that they can even

31:56.185 --> 32:00.185
ask God, “Why did You exist?”

32:00.519 --> 32:02.060
They can go to that limit, you know,

32:02.685 --> 32:05.976
there’s nothing surprising.

32:06.352 --> 32:09.976
So this arrogance, this ego has blinded us from God.

32:10.310 --> 32:12.310
We think no end of ourselves,

32:12.560 --> 32:14.268
we are very self-opinionated,

32:14.685 --> 32:17.268
and we do not know much about it.

32:17.810 --> 32:22.602
So this Power, this Shakti is the one which has given you

32:22.893 --> 32:25.727
Self-realization, will also give you God-realization;

32:26.185 --> 32:27.769
but still you will not understand God.

32:28.185 --> 32:31.727
You have to go above God to understand Him.

32:33.060 --> 32:34.769
How will you understand?

32:34.769 --> 32:36.477
Supposing there’s something below you,

32:36.477 --> 32:37.810
you can understand;

32:38.101 --> 32:39.727
but something above you, how will you understand?

32:40.101 --> 32:42.727
Supposing somebody is down below in Cabella

32:43.268 --> 32:44.727
and wants to understand about My house,

32:45.393 --> 32:48.143
will he understand?

32:48.519 --> 32:53.851
He has to go above the Cabella to see My house.

32:54.560 --> 32:56.976
So the Source from which we have come,

32:57.519 --> 32:59.769
we cannot understand that.

33:00.101 --> 33:01.560
We cannot judge, we cannot say why;

33:02.685 --> 33:08.809
that is God’s wish, God’s desire, whatever He does.

33:09.018 --> 33:10.893
So what we have to say: whatever His wish,

33:11.310 --> 33:14.101
we’ll be happy with that.

33:14.602 --> 33:17.727
And the power that is within you is Amba,

33:18.268 --> 33:20.685
is the desire power of God itself.

33:21.018 --> 33:22.393
So whatever your wish is, means that

33:23.227 --> 33:28.018
His wish is that you should enter into His Kingdom.

33:28.519 --> 33:31.185
Now you enter into the Kingdom of God.

33:31.851 --> 33:33.976
Then the Shakti makes you

33:34.519 --> 33:39.393
sit on different beautiful positions,

33:40.935 --> 33:43.227
and some are sitting in the Heart of God,

33:43.851 --> 33:46.809
some are sitting in the Sahasrara of God,

33:47.310 --> 33:49.893
in the Kingdom of God.

33:50.435 --> 33:53.227
Now you should assume your power.

33:53.727 --> 33:56.227
On Navaratri now, you should understand that it has now

33:56.685 --> 34:01.519
crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position,

34:01.809 --> 34:03.060
where you must assume.

34:03.352 --> 34:05.352
I have told you many a times, now believe that

34:05.352 --> 34:07.602
you are Sahaja yogis.

34:07.602 --> 34:10.769
Believe that you are,

34:11.018 --> 34:13.727
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

34:14.060 --> 34:16.644
You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that,

34:16.644 --> 34:18.685
why She does that, why He does that.

34:19.101 --> 34:21.809
You cannot say that – that’s different.

34:22.101 --> 34:26.435
But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly,

34:26.769 --> 34:30.018
it is not like a politician fighting, no;

34:30.435 --> 34:33.685
it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

34:34.101 --> 34:38.477
blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished,

34:38.893 --> 34:42.352
and made knowledgeable.

34:42.727 --> 34:45.935
But still this arrogance has to go down,

34:46.185 --> 34:49.935
that we can understand why it happens.

34:50.519 --> 34:54.310
That humility is very important for us;

34:54.644 --> 34:57.976
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

34:58.644 --> 35:01.101
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

35:01.519 --> 35:04.769
now this power has to go higher and higher.

35:05.018 --> 35:09.809
For that, first you should be humble.

35:10.227 --> 35:12.685
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

35:12.893 --> 35:17.560
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

35:17.935 --> 35:21.519
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

35:22.018 --> 35:25.727
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

35:26.060 --> 35:28.268
You are too great.

35:28.644 --> 35:33.644
But let us know ourselves.”

35:34.268 --> 35:36.685
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

35:37.185 --> 35:39.435
like His own image.

35:39.935 --> 35:42.976
That means He has given you all the powers.

35:43.560 --> 35:44.644
He has made you.

35:45.018 --> 35:49.477
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

35:49.893 --> 35:52.602
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

35:53.268 --> 35:56.143
He has made you in His own image.

35:56.519 --> 36:02.644
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

36:03.060 --> 36:05.185
These powers are with you.

36:05.809 --> 36:07.018
But the first thing you have to have,

36:07.393 --> 36:09.227
the discipline within yourself,

36:09.809 --> 36:11.143
that is missing.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.143
People cannot discipline themselves – means

36:13.519 --> 36:15.268
if they cannot control themselves,

36:15.602 --> 36:18.935
how can they control anyone?

36:20.976 --> 36:24.519
No discipline means you cannot control yourself.

36:24.976 --> 36:26.685
So the discipline should be that first

36:27.101 --> 36:29.809
you must see that you control yourself,

36:30.227 --> 36:34.352
because now you are in the Kingdom of God.

36:34.809 --> 36:37.893
Have you seen a film called “Mr. Bean”

36:38.227 --> 36:41.602
where they show a stupid man, you see?

36:42.477 --> 36:46.685
So what happens that when you are now come to the court

36:47.143 --> 36:48.685
of the Goddess,

36:49.018 --> 36:51.060
when you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

36:51.477 --> 36:54.893
you are made to sit on your throne in a dignified way.

36:55.310 --> 36:59.143
But you start behaving like Mr. Bean, you see.

36:59.435 --> 37:01.976
You don’t know how to sit on your seat,

37:02.310 --> 37:04.560
you want to sit on the sides,

37:04.851 --> 37:08.519
you want to sit on the wall or do all kinds of things.

37:08.769 --> 37:10.435
There’s no discipline.

37:10.893 --> 37:12.560
You have to have the discipline.

37:13.101 --> 37:14.352
Where are you sitting?

37:14.851 --> 37:16.893
You are sitting in the Kingdom of God.

37:17.352 --> 37:18.809
So you should have that dignity,

37:19.352 --> 37:20.809
you should have that affection,

37:21.435 --> 37:22.809
you should have that compassion,

37:23.143 --> 37:27.477
you must have that love, and the dedication.

37:27.809 --> 37:30.352
But if it is not there, then this power is useless,

37:30.727 --> 37:33.893
because you are the vehicle of that power.

37:34.185 --> 37:38.060
Supposing I have to take water, I have to have glass

37:38.519 --> 37:40.976
which is emptied inside.

37:41.268 --> 37:42.769
If it is already full with ego,

37:43.185 --> 37:45.310
what can you put inside that?

37:45.560 --> 37:48.227
Or if it is a stone, you can’t drink water out of that,

37:48.644 --> 37:56.310
you’ll have to dig in the space for putting the water.

37:56.685 --> 37:59.018
So if you are already filled with your own ideas,

37:59.560 --> 38:05.809
with your own conveniences, with your own progress

38:06.060 --> 38:09.727
or whatever it is, only that,

38:10.018 --> 38:13.060
then you cannot rise very high.

38:13.519 --> 38:15.727
You have to surrender fully there, to say that

38:16.393 --> 38:19.976
“Mother, whatever is Your desire,

38:20.519 --> 38:26.352
that we do not want to have any our individual desire.”

38:26.851 --> 38:28.893
Then the desire of God will work.

38:29.310 --> 38:31.893
You want Kundalini to work for you which is the desire

38:32.310 --> 38:33.560
of God,

38:34.018 --> 38:37.435
not your desire, which is independent of your desire,

38:38.018 --> 38:43.018
but is the one which will fulfill your

38:43.352 --> 38:45.352
complete so-called desires,

38:46.018 --> 38:48.018
without even your Knowledge.

38:48.519 --> 38:51.352
Miracles after miracles will happen, so many miracles

38:51.644 --> 38:54.393
that now we do not know how to compile the book

38:54.727 --> 38:55.935
even on miracles.

38:56.393 --> 38:58.185
But these miracles are coming to you because you are

38:58.727 --> 39:00.101
realized souls.

39:00.851 --> 39:03.976
Your attention should be all right, you must see and

39:04.519 --> 39:07.893
introspect yourself. “I am sitting in the Kingdom of God,

39:08.352 --> 39:09.976
now what is my situation?

39:10.435 --> 39:13.477
Is it worth it, am I worth it, am I behaving in the same

39:13.809 --> 39:18.976
manner, or still I don’t believe?”

39:19.560 --> 39:21.560
If you don’t believe, how can you rise?

39:21.935 --> 39:24.268
“Believe” means that you have seen something,

39:24.685 --> 39:26.519
you have known something which is tangible,

39:26.935 --> 39:29.018
you have got the experience of it.

39:29.393 --> 39:33.769
Still you are not surrendered.

39:34.143 --> 39:36.310
If you surrender to the will of God,

39:36.644 --> 39:39.060
then everything is taken charge.

39:39.435 --> 39:41.976
It will never let you down, no question;

39:42.560 --> 39:44.976
and everything, all things which look like

39:45.352 --> 39:48.685
mountains of difficulties and obstructions

39:49.310 --> 39:53.560
you will surpass, just like an aeroplane goes over it.

39:53.976 --> 39:56.893
You won’t have any problem whatsoever.

39:57.268 --> 40:00.101
So one thing today, I am very happy that this puja is done

40:00.727 --> 40:06.810
by the people from a country which is discipline

40:07.143 --> 40:12.185
is very important – that is, Switzerland.

40:12.519 --> 40:18.935
But their discipline is for bad things, not for good.

40:22.310 --> 40:25.519
For example, they have a military:

40:25.851 --> 40:29.435
who is going to go to that far-fetched place, you see,

40:29.685 --> 40:30.769
to attack?

40:31.352 --> 40:32.477
No one.

40:32.851 --> 40:34.227
Why do they have military?

40:34.685 --> 40:36.435
And compulsory military, do you know that?

40:36.727 --> 40:38.435
Because they have looted other people’s money and

40:38.809 --> 40:41.727
kept them there, like thugs.

40:42.018 --> 40:43.810
So all that money is in their banks, and they are worried

40:44.143 --> 40:47.185
that any time, you see, any person can come up and

40:47.477 --> 40:56.393
demand the money, and may start using the power

40:56.644 --> 40:58.185
of destruction on us.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.310
So, because they are doing wrong, that’s why they

41:00.851 --> 41:05.352
have a military – out of fear, just out of fear.

41:05.769 --> 41:07.644
There is no need to have any military there.

41:07.644 --> 41:10.018
But everybody has to go to military

41:10.310 --> 41:12.685
and join the military,

41:13.018 --> 41:19.727
because they are thieves of the worst type.

41:20.602 --> 41:24.268
Then secondly, they have also very much slavery

41:24.727 --> 41:26.519
of the watch, which human beings have made,

41:26.893 --> 41:29.060
God has not made.

41:29.602 --> 41:31.851
So the watch is important, because they are

41:32.310 --> 41:34.851
making watches.

41:35.268 --> 41:38.185
If they are making watches and if they do not slave

41:38.435 --> 41:43.393
under the watches, who will buy their watches?

41:43.769 --> 41:45.893
They will say, “What’s the use of you all have watches,

41:46.352 --> 41:47.644
and the way you are?”

41:47.893 --> 41:49.685
So they are very disciplined.

41:50.435 --> 41:53.185
Not only, they also are, I mean extremely

41:53.560 --> 41:55.560
as they’ve shown yesterday, they’re really

41:55.893 --> 42:00.809
too much of cleanliness in them.

42:02.060 --> 42:03.935
Some of the girls who were married – I must say

42:04.393 --> 42:07.519
I’m sorry to say this, but it is a fact –

42:07.851 --> 42:09.851
were married from Switzerland,

42:10.310 --> 42:11.519
and the reports have come that

42:11.810 --> 42:13.519
“Mother, they must have been maid-servants

42:13.810 --> 42:15.435
or bar-maids.”

42:15.810 --> 42:17.227
So I said, “Why?”

42:17.560 --> 42:19.060
“If something falls down somewhere, immediately

42:19.435 --> 42:21.101
they’ll pick it up and keep there.

42:21.685 --> 42:24.018
If something even – it’s just like, like in the guests,

42:24.352 --> 42:26.435
you see the guests are sitting

42:26.435 --> 42:27.809
and they have no time to talk.

42:28.101 --> 42:29.685
There’s no question of talking to each other,

42:30.101 --> 42:30.893
there’s nothing;

42:31.685 --> 42:32.935
all the time they are worried about

42:33.393 --> 42:34.602
this thing, this is getting dirty,

42:35.143 --> 42:37.893
that is getting dirty, like maid-servants.”

42:38.310 --> 42:39.185
Can you imagine?

42:39.644 --> 42:42.602
This has also come from the same horrible disciplining

42:42.851 --> 42:43.976
that they have.

42:44.519 --> 42:48.851
This disciplining is not divine disciplining.

42:49.310 --> 42:50.976
Nature is not like that.

42:51.352 --> 42:53.560
If you see the nature, see how the nature is beautiful,

42:54.101 --> 42:57.560
the – you’ll never find any smell there.

42:57.851 --> 42:59.851
Ha, but if human beings go and live there,

43:00.227 --> 43:04.101
then all smells start. But there is no smell.

43:04.477 --> 43:07.727
Nature looks after itself, it cleanses itself, it does everything.

43:08.227 --> 43:11.143
So for everything there’s a time, it must be done with

43:11.519 --> 43:12.809
a little leisure.

43:13.268 --> 43:14.893
I mean, once if you have to clean the house,

43:15.185 --> 43:16.519
so clean the house.

43:16.893 --> 43:18.018
But all the time if your attention is cleaning this,

43:18.310 --> 43:20.976
cleaning this, make this clean, put this right –

43:21.435 --> 43:27.435
you are good for nothing, you are like a Hoover machine!

43:28.435 --> 43:30.310
And who can love such a woman

43:30.685 --> 43:36.560
who’s just a Hoover machine all the time?

43:42.477 --> 43:46.935
But again as the, you know the Devi has the,

43:47.352 --> 43:50.143
all the extremes, so this is one extreme.

43:50.519 --> 43:55.060
And the another extreme is that absolutely lousiest people,

43:55.519 --> 43:57.519
that in England –

43:58.143 --> 44:00.769
absolutely lousy, very lousy.

44:01.268 --> 44:03.644
They can live with all kinds of lousiness,

44:04.060 --> 44:08.060
and that is going too far.

44:08.393 --> 44:12.060
So this is in between one has to be.

44:12.519 --> 44:16.809
Cleanliness is for us, we are not for cleanliness.

44:17.018 --> 44:20.727
You are not paid for that, you are not maid-servants.

44:21.227 --> 44:22.976
So cleanliness has to be there.

44:23.393 --> 44:24.268
We like it so we’ll make it clean,

44:24.769 --> 44:25.810
but it should not be that

44:26.185 --> 44:29.060
everybody should be panicked about it;

44:29.560 --> 44:33.644
to be in a situation that you have no time to talk to

44:34.018 --> 44:37.227
anyone, to be nice to anyone, also no time even

44:37.685 --> 44:39.851
to meditate.

44:39.851 --> 44:42.060
Even meditating they will be seeing round

44:42.435 --> 44:44.560
if something is falling here, “Oh my God!”

44:44.976 --> 44:46.809
and they will go and pick up.

44:47.310 --> 44:49.769
I wouldn’t be surprised that even in the church they

44:49.976 --> 44:50.893
start doing that!

44:52.185 --> 44:56.352
There’s no discipline of meditation,

44:56.769 --> 45:00.809
discipline of meditation, of divine work,

45:00.809 --> 45:06.769
discipline of following the will of God –

45:07.101 --> 45:09.227
that’s not there.

45:09.809 --> 45:12.101
Unless and that discipline comes many,

45:12.477 --> 45:16.227
what you are doing is something so mundane and stupid,

45:16.685 --> 45:22.809
useless wastage of your life, have no dignity for yourself.

45:23.143 --> 45:27.727
So now as Sahaja yogis we have to have that discipline

45:28.185 --> 45:30.644
of meditation.

45:31.060 --> 45:36.060
Then the Power, this Amba, She knows you so well:

45:36.435 --> 45:37.644
She knows your past,

45:38.435 --> 45:40.685
and She knows what sort of a person you are.

45:40.685 --> 45:43.935
Once you start introspecting

45:44.268 --> 45:46.185
and seeing it within yourself,

45:46.560 --> 45:49.310
“what is wrong with me?”

45:49.809 --> 45:53.185
and to reach that state of complete equilibrium,

45:53.644 --> 45:55.018
“what have I to do?” –

45:55.477 --> 45:59.352
is to first of all, you have to meditate.

46:00.018 --> 46:04.352
There is no way out, I must tell you, there is no way.

46:04.727 --> 46:06.727
Somebody said, “Mother, I have given up eating this,

46:07.101 --> 46:09.893
I have given up eating that” – nothing.

46:10.393 --> 46:14.310
“Mother, I do this and I stand on my head” – nothing.

46:14.935 --> 46:17.810
You must meditate, and the meditation

46:18.185 --> 46:20.393
should be little bit in the morning

46:20.727 --> 46:22.560
and little bit in the evening.

46:22.976 --> 46:26.602
And don’t see your watch when you are meditating.

46:30.810 --> 46:34.477
The time has to be kept for meditation, whatever it is.

46:34.893 --> 46:36.477
It takes hardly any time.

46:36.477 --> 46:38.018
I mean, even I have seen women take so much time

46:38.435 --> 46:41.809
to get ready that even one tenth of that time

46:42.143 --> 46:45.352
if you can give for your meditation,

46:45.727 --> 46:48.477
you will be, you’ll not need much make-up.

46:48.976 --> 46:51.602
Your skin will improve, your hair will improve, your face

46:51.935 --> 46:54.809
will improve, everything will work out.

46:55.018 --> 46:57.602
You don’t have to use anything, don’t have to use any

46:58.060 --> 47:00.644
perfumes or anything whatsoever,

47:01.268 --> 47:04.310
your body itself will be full of perfume.

47:04.769 --> 47:06.310
Everything will be supplied.

47:06.727 --> 47:10.644
So what we have to do is to first of all see

47:10.851 --> 47:14.101
a surrender to the will of the God.

47:14.435 --> 47:17.560
For Sahaja yogis it’s very important.

47:17.809 --> 47:20.769
Once you surrender, all your problems will be solved.

47:20.976 --> 47:23.143
You surrender your problems also.

47:23.435 --> 47:25.851
“I leave it to You. God, You solve the problem.

47:26.227 --> 47:29.810
You do this.”

47:30.268 --> 47:34.060
It is such a precise, such an effective,

47:34.393 --> 47:40.143
such an efficient Power.

47:41.185 --> 47:47.519
And above all it loves you, cares for you, it forgives you.

47:47.851 --> 47:49.060
Even if you make mistakes it forgives,

47:49.560 --> 47:51.060
“All right, it will be all right.”

47:51.435 --> 47:53.935
It is wanting you all to be properly seated

47:54.310 --> 47:59.060
in your thrones, enjoying your power.

47:59.560 --> 48:03.809
So whatever is needed is done with great care.

48:04.352 --> 48:08.268
So Navaratri is now the tenth day of Navaratri,

48:08.727 --> 48:11.227
which is the most important for all of you,

48:12.018 --> 48:18.602
is where this Paramchaitanya has become active.

48:19.060 --> 48:21.810
And by its activity you should know it is become

48:22.310 --> 48:23.935
very powerful,

48:24.644 --> 48:29.769
and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you,

48:30.435 --> 48:34.185
tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.”

48:34.769 --> 48:37.060
It will take care of it.

48:37.976 --> 48:40.644
All wrong things you have done,

48:41.185 --> 48:43.101
all bad karmas you have done,

48:43.685 --> 48:47.727
you will be rewarded for that, no doubt.

48:48.143 --> 48:50.393
But if you are a realized soul, finished;

48:50.810 --> 48:52.519
you are not on that level.

48:52.519 --> 48:55.101
Like we can say that ordinary people

48:55.477 --> 48:57.727
can be charged with criminality,

48:58.101 --> 49:02.352
but supposing you rise to a higher status of kinghood,

49:02.727 --> 49:04.893
then nobody can charge you.

49:05.393 --> 49:07.227
You are above the law.

49:07.809 --> 49:10.477
In the same way, it has happened with you that nobody

49:10.810 --> 49:14.018
can touch you, nobody can destroy you, and

49:14.644 --> 49:17.935
nobody can hamper your progress.

49:18.310 --> 49:22.060
Only it is you who can do it.

49:22.560 --> 49:24.435
And nobody can harm Me,

49:24.769 --> 49:27.185
no rakshasa can harm Me and has never done so.

49:27.685 --> 49:31.851
But it is you who can harm Me;

49:32.435 --> 49:36.769
because in this life I have taken you into My body,

49:37.101 --> 49:40.893
and I am working it out in My body,

49:41.352 --> 49:44.685
everything, your cleansing, everything,

49:45.101 --> 49:46.935
which is a difficult task.

49:47.268 --> 49:48.893
But in the beginning only,

49:49.185 --> 49:52.018
this Power went to Adam and Eve and told them that

49:52.477 --> 49:54.477
“you must have the Knowledge.”

49:54.477 --> 49:58.143
So that promise has to be fulfilled

49:58.477 --> 49:59.727
and that has to be done,

50:00.060 --> 50:01.644
though it’s a very hazardous task.

50:02.060 --> 50:04.727
Specially in the West I find it is very hazardous

50:05.143 --> 50:08.644
to make people understand

50:09.310 --> 50:13.393
that they are the part and parcel of the whole;

50:13.851 --> 50:15.810
it’s a very difficult task.

50:16.227 --> 50:17.644
They talk of big, big things.

50:18.101 --> 50:19.310
I have seen people write articles nowadays

50:20.060 --> 50:21.809
that nothing is substantial,

50:22.352 --> 50:27.477
this science is so limited, it has not solved our problem.

50:27.851 --> 50:30.685
All these big, big books they are writing.

50:31.227 --> 50:33.227
But if you write to them now that we have found out

50:33.560 --> 50:36.143
something, they don’t want to see you.

50:36.602 --> 50:37.893
They don’t want to meet you.

50:38.393 --> 50:39.893
They have nothing to do with it.

50:40.477 --> 50:41.810
So I don’t know what sort of seekers they are,

50:42.352 --> 50:46.018
with such a big ego balloon in front, and they are seekers.

50:46.602 --> 50:48.935
What are they seeking?

50:49.310 --> 50:51.268
The ego, the balloon – supposing you have a big balloon

50:51.560 --> 50:53.185
and you drop in the water, what will happen,

50:53.644 --> 50:56.310
the balloon will take here and there and there and here,

50:56.644 --> 50:58.935
you have no destination.

50:59.560 --> 51:02.101
In the same way they are without any destination,

51:02.685 --> 51:04.477
saying that “we are seeking, we are doing this,

51:04.769 --> 51:09.976
we are doing that” – without any destination,

51:10.685 --> 51:10.893
without any understanding,

51:11.268 --> 51:12.560
without any meaning to their life,

51:12.935 --> 51:14.809
absolutely useless people.

51:15.227 --> 51:16.727
They are worth nothing.

51:17.060 --> 51:18.809
We have to try as much as possible

51:19.185 --> 51:20.602
how many we can save;

51:20.935 --> 51:22.435
but those who do not want to come,

51:22.810 --> 51:25.519
there’s no need,

51:25.644 --> 51:27.227
there's no need for us.

51:27.560 --> 51:30.393
They have to ask for it, they have to humble down and

51:30.851 --> 51:33.310
they have to say that “We want to come to you” –

51:33.644 --> 51:35.018
then only we’ll have.

51:35.893 --> 51:37.101
I never write any letter to anyone,

51:37.477 --> 51:39.101
“Please come to My program.”

51:39.560 --> 51:41.602
All these gurus used to write to all the actors and

51:41.893 --> 51:45.685
musicians and all that; I never write.

51:46.018 --> 51:47.685
It’s just I am advertising Myself,

51:48.143 --> 51:50.352
if you want to come you can come.

51:50.685 --> 51:54.143
This advertisement also I was not willing.

51:55.935 --> 51:59.727
So you can imagine that

52:00.310 --> 52:06.310
we have now brought to the fruitfulness of the promise

52:06.727 --> 52:11.310
given long time back, that you will have the Knowledge.

52:11.809 --> 52:14.185
And you have the Knowledge.

52:14.809 --> 52:16.809
But with this Knowledge you should be identified,

52:17.310 --> 52:19.976
and you should know that you have this Knowledge,

52:20.477 --> 52:22.809
and that this Knowledge can be given to others.

52:23.602 --> 52:27.227
And we can transform this world into a beautiful world,

52:27.727 --> 52:31.810
and fulfill the vision of Adi Shakti.

52:32.602 --> 52:35.809
She created you for this purpose,

52:36.268 --> 52:38.769
brought you out from human level to the superhuman

52:39.268 --> 52:41.769
level for this purpose,

52:42.268 --> 52:44.393
and that is what you have to do it.

52:44.393 --> 52:50.560
And if you are today worshipping Me as the Jagadamba,

52:50.851 --> 52:52.101
then know that

52:52.560 --> 52:58.519
the Jagadamba itself is nothing else but Adi Shakti.

52:59.018 --> 53:04.393
And unless and until you people rise to that level

53:04.769 --> 53:07.644
of disciplining yourself in divine way –

53:08.018 --> 53:10.268
like some people are still smoking,

53:10.519 --> 53:13.310
“Oh, it’s all right, you know, we are ordinary people,

53:13.644 --> 53:15.644
we can’t do it.” All right, get out.

53:15.851 --> 53:19.809
Don’t worry about such people. They’ll be left behind,

53:20.185 --> 53:22.685
useless people, where will they go?

53:23.227 --> 53:25.435
They’ll be, I think, hanging in the limbo,

53:25.851 --> 53:29.727
because there isn’t much place now left even in the hell,

53:30.227 --> 53:32.143
so what is going to happen to them?

53:32.477 --> 53:33.560
But all this is available to you;

53:33.893 --> 53:34.810
only thing you must know

53:35.227 --> 53:38.893
how to control yourself, control your senses.

53:39.268 --> 53:42.810
In small, small things also we cannot control ourselves.

53:43.185 --> 53:45.810
If we cannot control our own horses,

53:46.185 --> 53:51.727
how can we reach that stage where we have to reach?

53:52.101 --> 53:55.060
So in all these small things don’t waste your energies.

53:55.435 --> 53:59.310
Just think, you have to meditate, you have to rise,

53:59.769 --> 54:02.685
and you have to give it to others.

54:03.101 --> 54:07.727
This is very much possible if you really love yourself.

54:08.143 --> 54:10.602
If you love yourself, then you have to understand that

54:11.227 --> 54:16.477
“See my body, see my mind, everything is given to me by

54:16.809 --> 54:19.519
God. How beautiful it is.

54:20.018 --> 54:22.935
And now it’s such a beautiful one, and it will be used by

54:23.268 --> 54:28.143
God for such a great purpose.”

54:28.519 --> 54:30.810
You are molded, you are made like that

54:31.268 --> 54:34.519
up to this point; but now it is your free will,

54:34.935 --> 54:38.809
and with this free will you have to rise.

54:39.101 --> 54:41.352
With this free will you have to understand

54:41.809 --> 54:47.435
what is to be done, and how to achieve that state.

54:48.602 --> 54:58.477
It is nature’s reaction to things.

54:59.018 --> 55:01.769
Always nature reacts to human beings.

55:02.185 --> 55:06.060
Nature has no free will but God reacts,

55:06.393 --> 55:08.935
and when the reaction of the God comes in

55:09.519 --> 55:12.435
then we find all these things happening.

55:12.810 --> 55:15.809
And I wish you could listen to My tape on Vishnumaya,

55:16.227 --> 55:20.435
which is very, very well explaining why all these

55:20.769 --> 55:25.851
calamities come, why people die of these calamities.

55:26.227 --> 55:29.227
It was a very good lecture, I hope you all will listen to it,

55:29.727 --> 55:32.227
and listen to it again and again.

55:32.602 --> 55:36.018
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

55:36.352 --> 55:38.644
but should be something you should try to understand.

55:39.018 --> 55:41.851
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

55:42.268 --> 55:44.519
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

55:44.935 --> 55:47.560
which none of them have said so far.

55:48.143 --> 55:49.976
Because you have got your realization,

55:50.560 --> 55:55.310
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

55:55.685 --> 56:04.435
May God bless you.
