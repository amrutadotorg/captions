00:10.300 --> 00:13.500
Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Eve of Birthday Puja

00:13.500 --> 00:15.510
Sydney, Australia
March 20th, 1990

00:15.510 --> 00:19.180
So My tour of Australia has come to an end.

00:19.180 --> 00:23.970
Today is a day I can say it’s all very well
done.

00:23.970 --> 00:31.150
We have had very good response; I didn’t
expect that much everywhere.

00:31.150 --> 00:38.030
It was tremendous and very great things have
happened, some miracles also, during this

00:38.030 --> 00:39.810
visit.

00:39.810 --> 00:50.740
And one has to know that Sahaja yogis have
to be with great potential manifesting.

00:50.740 --> 00:58.660
If they are, then it triggers very well; otherwise
I cannot work out.

00:58.660 --> 01:05.720
For that we have to understand that in Sahaja
Yoga there’s no sacrifice of any kind.

01:05.720 --> 01:09.360
Don’t have to sacrifice anything, it’s
all the time blessings throughout.

01:09.360 --> 01:14.210
You don’t have to sacrifice anything, and
you don’t have to suffer also anything – nothing

01:14.210 --> 01:16.570
of the kind.

01:16.570 --> 01:22.160
I have told you about how My father was in
jail, My mother was in jail and how many times,

01:22.160 --> 01:29.090
and how we suffered during the war of independence.

01:29.090 --> 01:35.380
We lost everything, all our properties, everything,
for the war of independence only.

01:35.380 --> 01:43.000
But this is the independence, the freedom
of an absolute nature: not only for you but

01:43.000 --> 01:46.320
for the whole world, for your children, for
everyone.

01:46.320 --> 01:48.080
It’s a tremendous work.

01:48.080 --> 01:52.000
It’s a very great achievement.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.030
In the history of spirituality, in the history
of the world this is the greatest thing that

01:58.030 --> 02:03.100
has happened, is that people are transformed
into a new awareness.

02:03.100 --> 02:05.810
Perhaps you are not aware of it.

02:05.810 --> 02:11.640
And we take it for granted, we don’t understand
the importance of it; and we get lost into

02:11.640 --> 02:16.930
smaller, smaller things and very wasteful
things which are of no value.

02:16.930 --> 02:22.060
How are these things will be going into the
history, you must understand that.

02:22.060 --> 02:25.860
And where do you stand in that history?

02:25.860 --> 02:29.730
What will you be called?

02:29.730 --> 02:32.280
So now first of all there were problems with
the leaders.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.410
All right.

02:33.410 --> 02:35.700
But there were some who stuck on to it.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.600
They didn’t give it up.

02:38.600 --> 02:43.560
They did not give it up because the leaders
were bad.

02:43.560 --> 02:46.930
Nobody wrote to Me, all right, but they stuck
on.

02:46.930 --> 02:55.790
But those who went away, why didn’t they
write to Me why they went away?

02:55.790 --> 02:57.640
This is an escape from reality.

02:57.640 --> 03:04.150
This is an escape, to say that there was something
wrong with the the ashram people, there was

03:04.150 --> 03:08.680
something wrong with the leaders – of course,
it was.

03:08.680 --> 03:10.710
But you should have written to Me – why
didn’t you write to Me?

03:10.710 --> 03:21.100
Why did you take such decisions on your own,
and just left the Sahaja Yoga into lurch?

03:21.100 --> 03:26.410
We have to be people of quality, otherwise
Sahaja Yoga won’t work out.

03:26.410 --> 03:34.030
It’s not meant for people who are mediocres.

03:34.030 --> 03:38.080
If there are few, doesn’t matter; but there
have to be people of quality, that is one

03:38.080 --> 03:39.520
thing for sure.

03:39.520 --> 03:44.570
Now I have seen that everywhere people have
taken here a view that it’s better to have

03:44.570 --> 03:45.570
separate houses.

03:45.570 --> 03:52.520
I mean, this is another absurd view: from
where it has come into your heads, I don’t

03:52.520 --> 03:53.520
know.

03:53.520 --> 03:59.200
Absolutely absurd, against Sahaj, it’s most
asahaj view.

03:59.200 --> 04:02.030
Today only I was reading, five old ladies
were killed by one man, because they were

04:02.030 --> 04:07.540
living alone in every house.

04:07.540 --> 04:14.350
Such violence, such horrible atmosphere everywhere.

04:14.350 --> 04:18.880
Even for security it’s better that you live
together, at least eight people, ten people

04:18.880 --> 04:20.220
together.

04:20.220 --> 04:27.370
There’s no sacrifice in it, there’s no
sacrifice.

04:27.370 --> 04:31.680
On the contrary if you live together as I’ve
told you, you save money, your children are

04:31.680 --> 04:36.669
looked after; if somebody’s pregnant she’s
looked after, there’s somebody to look after

04:36.669 --> 04:39.349
you.

04:39.349 --> 04:41.159
But what is the gain of having another house,
I don’t understand.

04:41.159 --> 04:51.590
You have to work much harder, pay much more,
but a kind of a ego satisfaction is there.

04:51.590 --> 04:56.919
And then they develop problems, I have seen:
we’ve got cancer, we’ve got heart attacks,

04:56.919 --> 05:00.499
we’ve got this, “my son has run away”,
that has happened, that has happened.

05:00.499 --> 05:06.020
All this arbitrary behavior, and I am supposed
to be sort of responsible for everything.

05:06.020 --> 05:11.220
It’s a complete liability, once somebody
comes to Sahaja Yoga, then he is a liability

05:11.220 --> 05:12.220
on us.

05:12.220 --> 05:18.460
But he has no responsibilities and he has
no duties – only I have.

05:18.460 --> 05:20.589
That’s not proper.

05:20.589 --> 05:27.789
So now I have to tell you today very frankly
that you all have to live together, at least

05:27.789 --> 05:31.990
eight to ten people in a place.

05:31.990 --> 05:36.419
And don’t fight, and don’t create groups.

05:36.419 --> 05:40.699
Group-making is a very wrong thing.

05:40.699 --> 05:45.419
Before making any group you write to Me.

05:45.419 --> 05:51.110
You are all welcome to write to Me, and I’ll
attend to that letter if it is worth attending,

05:51.110 --> 05:54.800
because I know everything through vibrations.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.860
Don’t talk against each other.

05:56.860 --> 06:00.819
It’s a murmuring souls, and Christ has said
such people will go to hell.

06:00.819 --> 06:04.919
It’s not hell outside, I tell you, it will
be the hell here.

06:04.919 --> 06:07.409
It’s hell here.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.810
I have seen people suffering.

06:08.810 --> 06:12.270
I have been so frightened, you have no idea.

06:12.270 --> 06:16.039
Don’t play about with Sahaja Yoga at all.

06:16.039 --> 06:19.759
I’m just warning you, it’s a very serious
thing.

06:19.759 --> 06:25.560
People have got heart attacks, have got accidents,
have got cancers, all kinds of things, and

06:25.560 --> 06:30.089
really I am quite frightened that you people
don’t realize that there is another force

06:30.089 --> 06:31.639
working it out.

06:31.639 --> 06:33.379
Don’t take arbitrary decisions.

06:33.379 --> 06:36.119
You are very safe in Sahaja Yoga.

06:36.119 --> 06:40.150
Stay in Sahaja Yoga, grow in Sahaja Yog, enjoy
in Sahaja Yog.

06:40.150 --> 06:43.240
Everything is there available for you.

06:43.240 --> 06:48.740
And you don’t have to do anything else except
that keep together: it’s a collective happening.

06:48.740 --> 06:50.750
It’s a collective.

06:50.750 --> 06:59.300
If you are not in the collective, the Divine
is not interested in you at all – you are

06:59.300 --> 07:02.389
out of it.

07:02.389 --> 07:09.449
Only the collective gets the power, only the
collective is magnetic.

07:09.449 --> 07:14.789
Single person who lives away from collective
all the time, is something wrong with that

07:14.789 --> 07:15.789
person.

07:15.789 --> 07:18.740
If you cannot be collective, there’s something
wrong.

07:18.740 --> 07:22.819
Such a person should sit down and find out
what’s wrong with that person, must get

07:22.819 --> 07:26.719
it corrected, absolutely corrected.

07:26.719 --> 07:31.610
And see to it that you are all right; because
this is for your benevolence.

07:31.610 --> 07:39.060
You want to lead a happy, healthy, good life,
then be sensible, have some wisdom about it.

07:39.060 --> 07:43.979
And so some people who have been negative
are still negative, and just thinking on the

07:43.979 --> 07:45.839
same lines.

07:45.839 --> 07:53.110
So it’s high time all of you have to work
it out sensibly, and understanding.

07:53.110 --> 08:04.139
There are leaders because I have to have communication,
that’s all.

08:04.139 --> 08:06.009
And they will communicate to Me about you
people.

08:06.009 --> 08:08.180
If there are problems, they will try to solve
you.

08:08.180 --> 08:13.539
If they cannot solve it, they’ll write to
Me and I’ll have to see to it.

08:13.539 --> 08:19.569
There’s not going to be any regimentation
in Sahaja Yoga at all; it is a thing of love.

08:19.569 --> 08:21.150
But you must have love for yourself.

08:21.150 --> 08:23.939
I mean, you should be self-disciplined.

08:23.939 --> 08:28.919
Now imagine how I must have felt: I have come
here, I’ve worked so hard for so many times

08:28.919 --> 08:32.520
I have been here, and when I come here what
I find, everything is broken down.

08:32.520 --> 08:36.640
It’s so sad – I’ve worked so hard.

08:36.640 --> 08:43.269
But next time I am going to see you all settled
down in proper ashrams, in different place.

08:43.269 --> 08:47.800
Not for your own comfort you should think,
but if you have an ashram you put a center

08:47.800 --> 08:48.800
there.

08:48.800 --> 08:51.220
Every place you can have a center.

08:51.220 --> 08:56.120
In Bombay, I don’t know, we have eighteen
or twenty-one centers, in Bombay.

08:56.120 --> 09:00.790
That’s how it increases, and improves it.

09:00.790 --> 09:04.490
You have centers everywhere, so it’s available
to people all the time.

09:04.490 --> 09:09.430
You would talk about it, meet every day, evening
time you all can meet, talk to each other;

09:09.430 --> 09:13.279
and you have one day in a week somewhere,
in a school or something, big place where

09:13.279 --> 09:14.699
you all meet.

09:14.699 --> 09:18.839
The more you meet, the more there is rapport,
the more there is collectivity, the more there

09:18.839 --> 09:23.449
are blessings for each one of you, and for
all of you.

09:23.449 --> 09:29.730
It absolutely simultaneously works out; whilst
when there is no collectivity – no.

09:29.730 --> 09:33.700
When there is collectivity, everything works
out.

09:33.700 --> 09:36.650
Everything is available to you.

09:36.650 --> 09:41.589
So don’t try to break the collectivity by
forming any groups or anything – nothing

09:41.589 --> 09:44.850
of the kind.

09:44.850 --> 09:47.700
If you find anything wrong you have to write
to Me.

09:47.700 --> 09:54.110
But it’s everybody’s responsibility is
to sustain the collectivity, to support it,

09:54.110 --> 09:55.779
to help it.

09:55.779 --> 10:01.490
If you find that somebody is talking about
somebody else, then you say, “No, no, he

10:01.490 --> 10:03.550
was talking very good about you.

10:03.550 --> 10:08.870
Why are you talking ill about that person?”

10:08.870 --> 10:13.990
This is what, this is what Christ has said,
that these are peacemakers.

10:13.990 --> 10:18.350
But somebody says something about someone
– oh, then you go into, “Ho, ho, ho, that

10:18.350 --> 10:21.400
one is like this,” then another one.

10:21.400 --> 10:28.589
We are not like common people, we are not
ordinary people, we are saints.

10:28.589 --> 10:35.800
We are to respect each other, to love each
other, to understand and enjoy each other.

10:35.800 --> 10:39.149
What will the children say tomorrow?

10:39.149 --> 10:43.000
So nobody should get away with this idea that
we can have separate houses, live separately

10:43.000 --> 10:44.660
and we are all right.

10:44.660 --> 10:48.470
Better take out all My photographs from them;
they have no business.

10:48.470 --> 10:52.630
At least eight persons should be there in
one household, at least, minimum.

10:52.630 --> 10:54.839
Eight to ten people is a good idea.

10:54.839 --> 10:59.300
There’s no safety, there’s no progress,
there’s nothing in such houses where they

10:59.300 --> 11:00.900
live alone very nicely.

11:00.900 --> 11:06.350
Morning till evening they are cooking, cleaning,
sweeping, swabbing, looking after the car,

11:06.350 --> 11:13.899
locking the house – what else are they doing?

11:13.899 --> 11:19.500
It’s so boring to be alone, it’s extremely
boring.

11:19.500 --> 11:23.740
Now I have already told you very clearly that
we have to live together.

11:23.740 --> 11:29.470
And let the children know each other, know
everyone, they should know about their friendship.

11:29.470 --> 11:35.250
And you know, it is so nice the way they love
each other and the way they talk to each other,

11:35.250 --> 11:39.230
and about their aunties and uncles they talk
so sweetly.

11:39.230 --> 11:44.290
So many aunties and uncles to have is something
so remarkable; to have so many nephews and

11:44.290 --> 11:49.779
nieces all over.

11:49.779 --> 11:53.509
And unless and until you have that kind of
a feeling, it won’t work out.

11:53.509 --> 11:56.959
Then if somebody finds something wrong with
your child and tells you, don’t get angry

11:56.959 --> 11:59.629
for that – thank him.

11:59.629 --> 12:00.629
Try to improve your child.

12:00.629 --> 12:03.850
The improvement of your child is for the benevolence
of the child.

12:03.850 --> 12:04.850
Not to feel bad: “this is my child.”

12:04.850 --> 12:06.230
This “my” business has to go a little
bit; then I will come.

12:06.230 --> 12:14.280
If there is “my house”, “my children”,
“my car”, “my” this, this has to go

12:14.280 --> 12:15.560
away.

12:15.560 --> 12:29.089
Let us see how we start diverting our energies
to a collective beauty, collective love, collective

12:29.089 --> 12:30.730
understanding.

12:30.730 --> 12:34.520
And if it is not, there’s something wrong
with you, take it from Me, something wrong.

12:34.520 --> 12:40.399
So either you are right-sided or left-sided:
find out and just get yourself cleared out.

12:40.399 --> 12:46.960
Treat it out yourself, and you will understand
that there was something wrong with you, nothing

12:46.960 --> 12:52.319
wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

12:52.319 --> 12:59.010
All such ideas are going to completely blast
Sahaja Yoga and finish it off.

12:59.010 --> 13:07.259
They are selfish, self-oriented, absolutely
out-of-date ideas for Sahaja Yoga.

13:07.259 --> 13:14.149
You can have one room each other, for each
one of them and you can stay together, and

13:14.149 --> 13:17.209
you can have somebody as a leader, whomsoever
you want.

13:17.209 --> 13:22.209
If you want we can do rotation of leaders
later on if you like that, can be done also.

13:22.209 --> 13:25.720
But still I would say that unless and until
there is something wrong with the leader,

13:25.720 --> 13:31.709
it’s not proper to remove such a leader.

13:31.709 --> 13:34.000
But whatever you suggest, I don’t mind,
but we have to have someone who is looking

13:34.000 --> 13:41.560
after you, and informing Me about it.

13:41.560 --> 13:47.690
But the wife of the leader is never a leader,
understand that, it’s only the leader is

13:47.690 --> 13:48.690
the leader.

13:48.690 --> 13:51.550
Whether it’s the husband or a wife of a
leader is not a leader, and she should never

13:51.550 --> 13:52.980
behave like that.

13:52.980 --> 14:00.300
She has to be very motherly, kindly, and all
the time looking after all the people in a

14:00.300 --> 14:04.569
more gentler way than the husband himself.

14:04.569 --> 14:09.029
That’s the sign of a good wife of a leader.

14:09.029 --> 14:17.440
We have some, we have such women, and wherever
there have been good ashrams, Sahaja Yoga

14:17.440 --> 14:19.240
has prospered.

14:19.240 --> 14:22.879
It has gone up to the governments, it has
gone up to the intellectuals, it has gone

14:22.879 --> 14:29.490
up to such areas where we would never expect
it, anywhere there has been.

14:29.490 --> 14:41.350
And most of the people now are in the ashrams,
in the whole world.

14:41.350 --> 14:48.620
I hope you all understand the importance of
it.

14:48.620 --> 14:54.920
Anything goes wrong with anyone here, immediately
the telephone comes, that something has gone

14:54.920 --> 14:56.490
wrong with such and such person is sick.

14:56.490 --> 14:59.149
Then I can tell you what is to be done, how
to get that person cured.

14:59.149 --> 15:04.379
But supposing you are in some other house
…. It happened like this, one fellow was

15:04.379 --> 15:06.959
like that and he met with an accident.

15:06.959 --> 15:08.490
Met with an accident, nobody knew.

15:08.490 --> 15:13.740
He was lying in the hospital – when he came
to his consciousness he called for somebody,

15:13.740 --> 15:18.999
then they told Me.

15:18.999 --> 15:23.709
It’s like one family, it’s like one body.

15:23.709 --> 15:26.110
If something hurts here, every – the whole
body knows.

15:26.110 --> 15:29.310
You must know how many there are with us.

15:29.310 --> 15:32.480
You feel so strong and happy.

15:32.480 --> 15:38.029
But first of all you must develop that rapport,
you must develop that love, must develop that

15:38.029 --> 15:39.199
personality.

15:39.199 --> 15:43.990
Now those who are left-sided, I’ve already
told them what treatment they have to take,

15:43.990 --> 15:45.889
and take it seriously.

15:45.889 --> 15:50.540
Left-sidedness should not be allowed to grow
at all – I tell you, it’s very dangerous.

15:50.540 --> 15:55.420
All these horrible diseases that you have
heard of, all of them, one and all – say

15:55.420 --> 16:04.519
epilepsy, mental derangements, you can say
cancer, all psychosomatic, this myelitis,

16:04.519 --> 16:12.029
then there are other diseases like AIDS, all
that – attack only left-sided people.

16:12.029 --> 16:16.010
Anybody who has left side, immediately try
to get rid of that left side.

16:16.010 --> 16:20.990
The right side shows so everybody knows, and
you can throw away such a person, or you can

16:20.990 --> 16:21.990
correct it.

16:21.990 --> 16:25.089
But the left side be very careful, don’t
play about with the left side.

16:25.089 --> 16:29.620
Left side is very dangerous.

16:29.620 --> 16:35.509
To avoid that, don’t mix up with people
who are mentally deranged, don’t go to the

16:35.509 --> 16:42.160
hospitals where such people live, don’t
try to cure people who are left-sided – they

16:42.160 --> 16:45.470
can be all cured on My photograph.

16:45.470 --> 16:52.709
And if somebody starts telling too much about
their woes and all that, just shut your ears.

16:52.709 --> 17:01.240
All this left side comes from a kind of a
self-indulgence, in the sense that you start

17:01.240 --> 17:06.800
thinking you are so miserable, you are so
unhappy, you are no good, and all that.

17:06.800 --> 17:12.490
So the right-sided are over-confident, the
left-sided are diffident.

17:12.490 --> 17:16.790
But they’re, because they’re diffident,
you see, all kinds of viruses can attack.

17:16.790 --> 17:21.740
And these viruses are the thing which bring
forth diseases which cannot be cured.

17:21.740 --> 17:23.750
So be careful on that point.

17:23.750 --> 17:27.930
The right-sided people trouble others.

17:27.930 --> 17:33.280
The left-sided trouble themselves, and the
right-sided trouble others.

17:33.280 --> 17:39.200
They try to show off, they want to – just
think they’re too much.

17:39.200 --> 17:45.520
First sign of a right-sided is that he starts
suddenly shouting, or giving lectures also,

17:45.520 --> 17:47.810
that’s another one.

17:47.810 --> 17:53.350
Thirdly, he tries to show off that he’s
a very big, great Sahaja yogi.

17:53.350 --> 17:56.560
There’s nobody great in Sahaja Yoga, everybody
is just the same.

17:56.560 --> 18:02.600
Just like all fingers are the same, every
cell is the same, everybody is the same.

18:02.600 --> 18:09.440
So nobody higher and lower, there’s no hierarchy
in Sahaja Yoga.

18:09.440 --> 18:15.530
Everybody must understand that we are all
one, part and parcel of one body, and we don’t

18:15.530 --> 18:20.100
have to consider ourself higher or lower.

18:20.100 --> 18:27.380
So there are so many ways of expression of
these boastful, right-sided people.

18:27.380 --> 18:32.810
And we can pull their legs – all right,
allowed!

18:32.810 --> 18:38.010
If somebody boasts too much you just pull
their legs, that’s allowed.

18:38.010 --> 18:43.490
That’s how in India nobody can have ego,
because from very childhood if somebody tries

18:43.490 --> 18:47.570
to show off, pull their legs.

18:47.570 --> 18:50.710
If somebody talks loudly, pull their legs.

18:50.710 --> 18:53.080
If somebody laughs loudly, pull their legs.

18:53.080 --> 19:00.650
I mean, anything somebody tries to do, overdo,
just pull their legs.

19:00.650 --> 19:06.200
So it doesn’t behoove for a Sahaja yogi
to be like that.

19:06.200 --> 19:13.930
Sahaja yogi has to be very dignified; otherwise
why will people come to Sahaja Yoga, if we

19:13.930 --> 19:17.000
are just like them?

19:17.000 --> 19:23.160
We have to be exceptional, isn’t it?

19:23.160 --> 19:34.510
And that’s what is what I call dignified,
loving, affectionate, kind, sweet – that’s

19:34.510 --> 19:40.130
what is the beauty.

19:40.130 --> 19:47.580
So anybody who shouts, screams, gets angry,
full of anger, this thing, bring one pin and

19:47.580 --> 19:53.250
just prick it – allowed!

19:53.250 --> 19:56.090
And if he says anything, it’s to prick your
ego.

19:56.090 --> 19:58.900
Show the pins, you see, like this.

19:58.900 --> 20:08.620
He’ll understand, “All right, this is
what I have.”

20:08.620 --> 20:15.910
So when you make a fun of a person who is
egoist he may not like it; but you show him

20:15.910 --> 20:19.340
a pin, he’ll understand, “Oh God, I have
got it!”

20:19.340 --> 20:21.840
They are quite aware of their ego, they don’t
want to have it.

20:21.840 --> 20:28.830
There was a gentleman from Delhi, his son
wrote to Me saying that “My father says

20:28.830 --> 20:34.720
that he’s not allowed to speak at all, and
he’s feeling very sad about it.”

20:34.720 --> 20:40.040
So in the lecture I said that nobody is allowed
to speak.

20:40.040 --> 20:48.630
After My tape, meditate, stay in that meditative
mood, and go home.

20:48.630 --> 20:53.120
Not that just after meditation, “Oh, what
cake I am going to have?” – all rush to

20:53.120 --> 20:54.120
the kitchen.

20:54.120 --> 20:57.500
So it’s surprising, even Indians are surprised
at it.

20:57.500 --> 21:01.420
India, people don’t get so much to eat,
but they are not hankering so much after food.

21:01.420 --> 21:05.410
Here the first attention is in the kitchen,
all the time they are in the kitchen.

21:05.410 --> 21:10.520
How many times you take your tea is important.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.380
You should count how many times you are in
the kitchen.

21:12.380 --> 21:17.650
I mean, you are still little babies, I tell
you, in that respect.

21:17.650 --> 21:22.630
I don’t think I have ever opened a fridge
to take out even water for Myself – I mean,

21:22.630 --> 21:29.600
since I remember My life, never.

21:29.600 --> 21:34.250
So this hankering after food is also another
funny thing that is.

21:34.250 --> 21:38.190
After meditation people just get up and go
to eat.

21:38.190 --> 21:40.710
You must sit down, meditate.

21:40.710 --> 21:46.740
Now after meditation if people start giving
speeches, then the people are anxious to go

21:46.740 --> 21:54.450
to the kitchen, here’s somebody giving lectures,
so big problem starts between the two.

21:54.450 --> 21:58.260
They don’t like it, because they think,
“Oh, there’s a cake there, there’s something

21:58.260 --> 22:03.790
biryani kept, and here it is this gentleman
is trying to give us a lecture.”

22:03.790 --> 22:05.350
No one likes it.

22:05.350 --> 22:10.000
But it should be something very different,
that we are in meditative mood, how can we

22:10.000 --> 22:12.300
come out of it?

22:12.300 --> 22:15.930
So I’d better tell you a story of Janaka,
which is very important.

22:15.930 --> 22:21.320
He was the one, in the beginning at the time
of Shri Rama, He was the father-in-law of

22:21.320 --> 22:23.549
Shri Rama, His name was Raja Janaka.

22:23.549 --> 22:26.230
And He was a king.

22:26.230 --> 22:28.760
So all the saints used to come and bow to
Him.

22:28.760 --> 22:34.140
And He was a king, He used to live like a
king.

22:34.140 --> 22:39.210
So one fellow, Nachiketa asked his guru, he
said, “What is this, you bow to this Raja?

22:39.210 --> 22:44.310
He has got all the wealth, He has got everything,
wears all the ornaments, He has all pomp and

22:44.310 --> 22:45.310
show.

22:45.310 --> 22:48.020
Why should you, a saint like you, go and bow
to Him?”

22:48.020 --> 22:49.380
He said “He’s videhi.

22:49.380 --> 22:51.090
He’s so detached, He’s videhi.

22:51.090 --> 22:53.140
He doesn’t exist in His body.”

22:53.140 --> 22:54.170
He couldn’t understand.

22:54.170 --> 22:57.230
He said, “All right, I’ll go and see Him.”

22:57.230 --> 23:02.460
So he went and told Him that “I want to
become self-realized, as You are.”

23:02.460 --> 23:05.750
He said, “You ask Me everything; I can give
you, but no self-realization.”

23:05.750 --> 23:10.640
“All right, we’ll see about it,” he
said.

23:10.640 --> 23:12.300
So one day they were having a bath.

23:12.300 --> 23:16.930
He said, “Let’s go to the river, we’ll
have our bath.”

23:16.930 --> 23:22.270
So He took this boy, they were sitting and
having the bath, when some people came and

23:22.270 --> 23:29.640
told that “Your palace is burning, and everybody
is running away.”

23:29.640 --> 23:33.750
So He was still in meditative mood, He wouldn’t
listen.

23:33.750 --> 23:38.240
Then they came back again, shouted, “See
now, Your wife and children all are, have

23:38.240 --> 23:43.730
come out of it and they are all running away,
because the whole thing is getting burned.”

23:43.730 --> 23:46.310
Still He was in meditative mood, least bothered.

23:46.310 --> 23:54.980
Then they said, “Now the fire is coming
this side, and what are You doing?”

23:54.980 --> 23:57.220
So Nachiketa got up and he caught hold of
his clothes.

23:57.220 --> 24:00.400
He thought, “I should wear my clothes at
least, they’ll be burnt.”

24:00.400 --> 24:03.650
He was still meditating.

24:03.650 --> 24:07.190
Then Nachiketa realized that He is videhi.

24:07.190 --> 24:12.580
That’s why Sitaji is called as Vaidehi,
because She is the daughter of a videhi.

24:12.580 --> 24:14.360
And that’s what we have to be.

24:14.360 --> 24:16.690
“Where is our attention?” we should say.

24:16.690 --> 24:20.270
You are meditating, take it deep down into
yourself.

24:20.270 --> 24:23.390
That’s a meditative mood.

24:23.390 --> 24:26.380
Keep yourself there.

24:26.380 --> 24:30.950
And after meditation you just get up silently,
sit for a while.

24:30.950 --> 24:37.361
I think best thing will be to have your food
first and then meditate, if that is so, if

24:37.361 --> 24:38.920
you think that is proper.

24:38.920 --> 24:50.350
But I think if you have to get now into that
new triggering, as I told you, into that new

24:50.350 --> 24:55.740
jumping that we have to do in Sahaja Yoga:
if you have to catch that train, then you

24:55.740 --> 24:57.700
hurry up.

24:57.700 --> 25:00.000
You have to change all these ideas.

25:00.000 --> 25:04.110
You have had many houses, you have had many
wives and many children in your previous life.

25:04.110 --> 25:08.130
You never had your realization – now you
have got it.

25:08.130 --> 25:14.910
So now just every individual, every one of
you should not think of others, think of yourself,

25:14.910 --> 25:21.170
“I have to do it, I have to get it, I have
to work it out.”

25:21.170 --> 25:23.290
This is what you have to do.

25:23.290 --> 25:25.130
“Why should I miss it?”

25:25.130 --> 25:30.720
This is a chance of many lives, the chance
of many lives.

25:30.720 --> 25:37.110
And that’s how you can jump over, and work
it out.

25:37.110 --> 25:44.970
We had lots of people in Australia, and if
they had worried about themselves as to “what

25:44.970 --> 25:46.630
I have done for Sahaja Yoga.”

25:46.630 --> 25:50.790
So in the morning you just decide, what I
am going to do for Sahaja Yog and myself;

25:50.790 --> 25:56.080
in the evening, what have I done for myself,
and what have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

25:56.080 --> 26:00.110
“Myself” doesn’t mean selfishness, but
“for my ascent.”

26:00.110 --> 26:01.110
Every day.

26:01.110 --> 26:04.300
You start a diary to write it down.

26:04.300 --> 26:05.590
You face yourself.

26:05.590 --> 26:06.890
No excuses, nothing.

26:06.890 --> 26:12.330
If you are left behind, what we can do?

26:12.330 --> 26:16.610
We can’t help it.

26:16.610 --> 26:21.230
And that is how you’ll find all kinds of
blessings will come to you.

26:21.230 --> 26:26.350
You’ll be able to save money, you’ll be
able to save time, you’ll get good jobs.

26:26.350 --> 26:33.200
All your problems can be solved if you really
surrender yourself to that Paramachaitanya.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.640
Everything can be done.

26:35.640 --> 26:41.620
But as long as you have this narrow-mindedness
and these narrow ideas about yourself, till

26:41.620 --> 26:43.800
then it won’t work out.

26:43.800 --> 26:49.510
This drop has to become one with the ocean,
then ocean takes over.

26:49.510 --> 26:53.020
And I am sure that can work out.

26:53.020 --> 27:01.860
And you are basically a very good point here,
because you are born on the land of Shri Ganesha.

27:01.860 --> 27:07.660
Basically it’s such an advantage for you,
much more than Russians have.

27:07.660 --> 27:12.340
But Russians, I don’t know how, they have
shot up so well.

27:12.340 --> 27:18.230
It’s an Agnya, it’s a right Agnya where
they have denied Christ, they have denied

27:18.230 --> 27:25.480
all religions, everything, and still they’re
prospering.

27:25.480 --> 27:28.090
So you are very well placed.

27:28.090 --> 27:32.890
And innocence can never be lost, can never
be lost, whatever you may try.

27:32.890 --> 27:42.910
Of course, there could be clouds, but they
get just into nothing, they just disappear.

27:42.910 --> 27:50.570
If you just try to clean off your innocence
and simplicity.

27:50.570 --> 27:54.501
And don’t think too much, “We should do
like this, we should organize like this, we

27:54.501 --> 27:56.630
should have this thing” – nothing of the
kind.

27:56.630 --> 27:58.860
Wherever you are, why to think?

27:58.860 --> 28:00.870
I never think, “Where I will sit?

28:00.870 --> 28:02.220
What will be My chair?

28:02.220 --> 28:03.250
How will I sleep?

28:03.250 --> 28:04.850
How will I go there?”

28:04.850 --> 28:05.850
Nothing.

28:05.850 --> 28:09.360
Just exist.

28:09.360 --> 28:11.600
Just exist.

28:11.600 --> 28:14.280
Everything works out for good, you should
know.

28:14.280 --> 28:18.920
Now, if you redden too much on your faces,
you should know you have left Vishuddhis.

28:18.920 --> 28:21.510
So first of all know that you are forgiven
for everything.

28:21.510 --> 28:24.890
Whatever you have done you are forgiven, just
remember.

28:24.890 --> 28:28.270
You are forgiven completely, absolutely hundred
percent.

28:28.270 --> 28:31.610
There’s nothing to feel guilty about, nothing
to feel guilty.

28:31.610 --> 28:37.830
And you are loved, you’re looked after,
you’re cared for.

28:37.830 --> 28:44.480
Paramchaitanya cares, it’s a caring, caring
government, I should say.

28:44.480 --> 28:49.040
It cares for you, looks after you, it manages
so many things.

28:49.040 --> 28:51.360
Unbelievable, it is.

28:51.360 --> 28:54.360
It manages, it works out.

28:54.360 --> 28:58.720
You must have heard about the story about
Cairns, what miracle has taken place, have

28:58.720 --> 28:59.720
you heard?

28:59.720 --> 29:00.720
No?

29:00.720 --> 29:01.720
So … Kay.

29:01.720 --> 29:03.010
Where is Kay?

29:03.010 --> 29:18.170
I was – Kay, can you tell them?

29:18.170 --> 29:31.180
Please come here.

29:31.180 --> 29:39.850
Just come.

29:39.850 --> 29:52.860
It’s too much!

29:52.860 --> 30:03.480
[Kay: It was a great blessing for Shri Mataji
to come to Cairns for us, and we had the opportunity

30:03.480 --> 30:08.160
of taking Shri Mataji out to the Great Barrier
Reef.]

30:08.160 --> 30:11.280
Just we decided spontaneously.

30:11.280 --> 30:13.630
[Kay: Very spontaneously!

30:13.630 --> 30:17.900
We delayed Her flight and kept Her from the
Brisbane people for a few hours, just to keep

30:17.900 --> 30:22.910
Her a little more time with us; but we thought
it was important that She put Her attention

30:22.910 --> 30:28.460
on the reef, because there was a lot of problems
happening with this great natural phenomena

30:28.460 --> 30:31.090
off the coast of Cairns.

30:31.090 --> 30:37.120
And we took a fast boat out to the reef, and
Shri Mataji graciously agreed to go down into

30:37.120 --> 30:41.730
a semi-submersible and had a look at the reef.

30:41.730 --> 30:44.470
And just looking at it, all the fish came
around.

30:44.470 --> 30:50.320
It was just a miracle to be in the reef with
Her, while She was looking at all this wonderful

30:50.320 --> 30:52.250
natural phenomena.

30:52.250 --> 30:59.150
But within the next day the attention of the
people who had been researching the reef and

30:59.150 --> 31:04.590
been worried about the Crown-of-Thorns starfish
eating the reef, and all the pollution, suddenly

31:04.590 --> 31:07.970
they started to realize the reef was regenerating.

31:07.970 --> 31:13.240
And all the Crown-of-Thorns starfish were
dying and they didn’t know why, they didn’t

31:13.240 --> 31:17.600
know where they’d come from, and now they
don’t know where they’ve gone!]

31:17.600 --> 31:19.990
They have written, it’s a mystery!

31:19.990 --> 31:22.780
[Kay: And they said it’s a mystery.

31:22.780 --> 31:28.130
But just a glance from our Mother has just
made everything right.

31:28.130 --> 31:30.790
Jai Shri Mataji!]

31:30.790 --> 31:40.480
But you are not a coral reef, you see, you
are not that; because you see, I cannot, I

31:40.480 --> 31:42.280
cannot transform you that way.

31:42.280 --> 31:44.690
You have to use your will power.

31:44.690 --> 31:50.160
They are all animals, you see, and animals
are under the control of God, that’s why

31:50.160 --> 31:51.470
they are called as “pashu”.

31:51.470 --> 31:54.020
This “pash” means all the bandhan.

31:54.020 --> 31:59.330
Under the bandhan of God: is whatever God
wants can do with them, with the, all the

31:59.330 --> 32:03.940
plants, of animals, everyone.

32:03.940 --> 32:09.230
But with human beings you can’t do everything.

32:09.230 --> 32:12.830
And also to understand human beings is another
problem.

32:12.830 --> 32:15.970
I don’t know how suddenly they become so
funny.

32:15.970 --> 32:20.690
They are all right, going straight, and suddenly
you don’t know what happens to them.

32:20.690 --> 32:29.340
So it’s a thing that God has created, and
then adding to that, man has created himself

32:29.340 --> 32:35.000
a little bit more – which is quite a difficult
thing to understand.

32:35.000 --> 32:39.691
So you better understand yourself, why you
do like that; and you have to with your free

32:39.691 --> 32:41.990
will accept that “I have to do it.”

32:41.990 --> 32:46.960
It is self disciplining and you’ll work
it out, and I’m sure one day you will show

32:46.960 --> 32:53.850
that in Australia we have really achieved
a great height.

32:53.850 --> 32:57.350
Children are wonderful here, no doubt.

32:57.350 --> 33:05.660
Then another thing is that we have started
a school in India, with the idea that the

33:05.660 --> 33:12.330
amount you pay only for their food and clothes
per month, that much is about to be charged

33:12.330 --> 33:15.200
for them.

33:15.200 --> 33:19.800
And they’ll have the best education of a
private school, with all other facilities

33:19.800 --> 33:22.950
like horse-riding, swimming and every sort
of thing.

33:22.950 --> 33:25.370
Music, dancing, everything can be taught to
them.

33:25.370 --> 33:30.800
And the amount will be the same, practically
as much as you’ll be spending on one child

33:30.800 --> 33:34.460
per month here, only for keeping them in the
house.

33:34.460 --> 33:39.450
So it would be like going to a general school.

33:39.450 --> 33:42.550
Of course, the transport and everything we’ll
look after.

33:42.550 --> 33:48.850
Now for this we have – as it is, you have
paid some money, and others have also paid

33:48.850 --> 33:51.780
– and we have made a good arrangement now.

33:51.780 --> 33:53.850
The school has started.

33:53.850 --> 33:58.621
With this kind of a school, the parents can
go and see their children for a month, two

33:58.621 --> 34:01.660
months, whichever way you like, and stay there
with them.

34:01.660 --> 34:07.210
Or if you want you can take them out to Himalayas,
whichever way you want to do.

34:07.210 --> 34:11.659
But till the age of sixteen years I am thinking
the children should not be exposed to this

34:11.659 --> 34:17.520
funny type of a country where they are just
trying to destroy them, because we have tried

34:17.520 --> 34:18.520
that also.

34:18.520 --> 34:24.160
When the children go back to parents, they
come back with great problems, so it’s difficult.

34:24.160 --> 34:27.550
So now to think “they are my children”
– if you really think they are your children,

34:27.550 --> 34:31.960
for their benevolence you must sacrifice.

34:31.960 --> 34:37.490
Maybe a little money you might have to sacrifice,
but more this feeling that “they are my

34:37.490 --> 34:38.490
children.”

34:38.490 --> 34:40.169
They’re actually Mine.

34:40.169 --> 34:45.530
And this will really help you a lot.

34:45.530 --> 34:51.700
You will be free here to do what you like,
you have more time for meditation, spreading

34:51.700 --> 34:56.090
Sahaja Yoga – because we are now on sort
of a warpath.

34:56.090 --> 35:02.970
And we have to make these children so good
that wherever they go they will not take to

35:02.970 --> 35:04.510
drugs, they will not take to bad things.

35:04.510 --> 35:07.370
On the contrary, they’ll be very great Sahaja
yogis.

35:07.370 --> 35:10.220
Maybe we might start a university later.

35:10.220 --> 35:12.990
But just up to sixteen years, it’s guaranteed.

35:12.990 --> 35:17.300
So now we have started for only, I think,
seven-year-old children a school now near

35:17.300 --> 35:22.020
Himalaya; and also now we are going to bring
it down.

35:22.020 --> 35:26.100
But now after three years or so we’ll be
starting school for all classes.

35:26.100 --> 35:31.210
For all classes we’ll be starting in a big
way, and we’ll be having best teachers and

35:31.210 --> 35:34.020
best timings, and we’ll look after them.

35:34.020 --> 35:39.430
Only thing is that if the Cambridge University
accepts then we’ll have the Cambridge University

35:39.430 --> 35:43.590
affiliation, because Indian standards are
too high, very high.

35:43.590 --> 35:45.860
They have to work really very hard for that.

35:45.860 --> 35:48.120
I would prefer Cambridge better.

35:48.120 --> 35:50.290
So they might agree to do that for us.

35:50.290 --> 35:55.940
That’s how our children can achieve a better
understanding of things, and they have more

35:55.940 --> 35:57.630
time for other things to do.

35:57.630 --> 36:00.930
So, so many things we are going to combine
there.

36:00.930 --> 36:05.310
Basic education of Gandhiji I am going to
introduce into that, where children know so

36:05.310 --> 36:12.650
much about the trees, about the plants, about
animals, about fishes, about the surroundings

36:12.650 --> 36:16.730
in which they live, about the Mother Earth,
about ecological problems and things like

36:16.730 --> 36:17.730
that.

36:17.730 --> 36:19.850
And we have to create really great leaders
out of them.

36:19.850 --> 36:24.500
So it is for you to decide now the children
that you want to send there.

36:24.500 --> 36:30.410
You can have children up to seven years here,
or six years here for your primary classes,

36:30.410 --> 36:32.150
but not for your high schools.

36:32.150 --> 36:34.840
But primary classes also we have.

36:34.840 --> 36:39.840
If you want to send your children for primary
classes we have that also, that we can look

36:39.840 --> 36:42.010
after those children who are for primary classes.

36:42.010 --> 36:46.970
And there will be leave for the children for
two months or three months, I think, for which

36:46.970 --> 36:51.100
you can come there, or you can take them anywhere
you feel like.

36:51.100 --> 36:54.900
But I would not advise you to bring them back
here because it’s too much of an exposure,

36:54.900 --> 36:57.290
and you know what’s happening to your children.

36:57.290 --> 37:02.000
They’ll have to learn how to respect parents,
respect everything; and to get the intrinsic

37:02.000 --> 37:07.600
value of everything properly evaluated in
their minds, so that they do not become stupid.

37:07.600 --> 37:10.730
I’m sure this will work out very well.

37:10.730 --> 37:22.710
I have seen some children in Rome: they have
become so sensible, so developed, so beautiful.

37:22.710 --> 37:26.740
So money-wise also we might have to cut down
little expenses of yours, doesn’t matter;

37:26.740 --> 37:29.910
for your children you have to do something.

37:29.910 --> 37:32.761
That’s the minimum they have worked it out.

37:32.761 --> 37:38.180
They said that per month it will be about
three hundred dollars for a child, inclusive

37:38.180 --> 37:42.090
of clothes, food, transport, everything, books,
everything.

37:42.090 --> 37:46.650
You don’t have to worry for their expenses
at all.

37:46.650 --> 37:52.370
You could give them some other clothes, but
they’ll have all their uniforms done by

37:52.370 --> 37:58.850
them, books, shoes, everything will be done
in that amount, and education of every kind.

37:58.850 --> 38:03.350
All kinds of arts, crafts, depending on the
aptitude of the child.

38:03.350 --> 38:07.060
And you’ll see, they will be something very
unique children.

38:07.060 --> 38:08.480
So think it over.

38:08.480 --> 38:13.730
And in that there is a lot of work entailed,
and some people are working it out.

38:13.730 --> 38:16.900
I’ll be getting some people from here also.

38:16.900 --> 38:28.170
And the whole process will be under My control,
so you don’t have to worry.

38:28.170 --> 38:48.810
So now, I hope I’ll be coming next year
again.

38:48.810 --> 38:53.300
But for next year – I mean of course, not
this year – but next year we have decided

38:53.300 --> 38:58.200
that it would be better to come here in the
month of April or May; because May is a better

38:58.200 --> 39:02.000
month here than March, and April is quite
hot.

39:02.000 --> 39:05.190
So what do you say, April or May?

39:05.190 --> 39:06.190
May.

39:06.190 --> 39:07.190
May, all right.

39:07.190 --> 39:15.900
But May, I can only come of fifth of May.

39:15.900 --> 39:28.030
After, I said, fifth of May, because we’ll
have one Sahasrara Day there and one here.

39:28.030 --> 39:34.760
And we can work it out that way to come by
May, so we can have one month of May spent

39:34.760 --> 39:35.760
here.

39:35.760 --> 39:36.760
I would like to spend more time.

39:36.760 --> 39:42.600
But you must not have any more groups, quarrels,
fighting, problems with husband and wife.

39:42.600 --> 39:46.800
I mean sometimes I feel, why did I marry them
to create these problems?

39:46.800 --> 39:51.840
They were all right without marriages!

39:51.840 --> 39:56.310
So all these petty things should not be there.

39:56.310 --> 39:58.770
You should all be big, great people.

39:58.770 --> 40:03.850
I would like to come and see you here in your
ashrams and things; I would like to know what

40:03.850 --> 40:06.660
you have been doing, what creative work you
have been doing.

40:06.660 --> 40:08.630
It’s beautiful things you can do.

40:08.630 --> 40:09.630
All right?

40:09.630 --> 40:13.210
So with that hope, tomorrow we’ll have this
Birthday Puja.

40:13.210 --> 40:16.369
And everybody is quite jealous of you that
I’m having My birthday here!

40:16.369 --> 40:34.850
I love you Australians very much, and you
have to also love yourself and have proper

40:34.850 --> 40:36.230
value about yourself.

40:36.230 --> 40:43.670
Don’t fritter away your lives, don’t waste
them on nonsensical things, that’s very

40:43.670 --> 40:44.670
precious.

40:44.670 --> 40:49.730
If you were not precious, you would not have
come to Sahaja Yoga, remember that.

40:49.730 --> 40:51.430
You would have been by now in some pub!

40:51.430 --> 40:54.390
All right.

40:54.390 --> 40:58.800
Now, so few things we have here.

40:58.800 --> 41:09.070
Now, can you read out the lists …? [Hindi]
Come along.

41:09.070 --> 41:10.930
This ….

41:10.930 --> 41:33.070
You see, they told Me not to bring anything,
and because there is Customs, I think that

41:33.070 --> 41:40.160
the Customs torture My life for nothing at
all.

41:40.160 --> 41:43.330
There are Customs, this thing, that thing.

41:43.330 --> 41:48.750
So I’m thankful to Mr Gupta that he could
manage to bring some things for you.

41:48.750 --> 41:55.390
And I could only buy something in the duty-free
shop for you.

41:55.390 --> 41:56.990
[Hindi]

41:56.990 --> 42:16.360
So first of all there’s a present for [Hindi]
… One for Stephen.

42:16.360 --> 42:37.310
These fountain pens are given to the leaders
so that they should write a letter to Me!

42:37.310 --> 42:52.130
Brian, Mr Brian.

42:52.130 --> 43:22.380
Now, others .… Cairns …. It’s all right,
I don’t read it.

43:22.380 --> 43:34.770
It’s all right … Melbourne … It’s
all right.

43:34.770 --> 43:39.890
So this is Perth.

43:39.890 --> 43:45.970
[Hindi] Brisbane.

43:45.970 --> 43:51.410
Brisbane is not here.

43:51.410 --> 43:58.300
We’ll keep it for Brisbane.What else?

43:58.300 --> 44:00.290
Canberra is not here?

44:00.290 --> 44:02.190
All right, keep it.

44:02.190 --> 44:03.720
Who else?

44:03.720 --> 44:04.720
Adelaide.

44:04.720 --> 44:09.070
For Adelaide, we should try still.

44:09.070 --> 44:14.980
I think it will work out now, things are better.

44:14.980 --> 44:16.360
Things are much better.

44:16.360 --> 44:25.380
It will work out.

44:25.380 --> 44:32.900
[Yogi: We have given You fifty-four macadamia
nut trees, for Your house in Prathisthan … for

44:32.900 --> 44:37.910
You to take back to India.]

44:37.910 --> 44:39.790
With Me?

44:39.790 --> 44:48.250
[Yogi: Yes, from the Adelaide collective,
for Your birthday.]

44:48.250 --> 44:53.890
Ah, I don’t think I can.

44:53.890 --> 44:58.820
But what you can do is to send them with these
people when they come.

44:58.820 --> 45:06.720
They can be kept here waiting?

45:06.720 --> 45:32.960
There’s somewhere here, and they can bring
it when they come for the Ganapatipule, all

45:32.960 --> 45:33.960
right?

45:33.960 --> 45:36.390
For the tour.

45:36.390 --> 45:38.110
All right?

45:38.110 --> 45:41.540
May God bless you.

45:41.540 --> 45:43.260
Thank you.

45:43.260 --> 45:44.970
All right.

45:44.970 --> 45:45.970
[Hindi]

45:45.970 --> 46:03.010
So we start giving saris to ladies who looked
after Me ... Canberra.

46:03.010 --> 46:16.510
So she’s not come as yet?

46:16.510 --> 46:21.020
All right.

46:21.020 --> 46:27.180
Lyn, is she here?

46:27.180 --> 46:34.910
Lyn from Brisbane … Cheryl?

46:34.910 --> 46:43.360
… Sandya Sapate … Jo?

46:43.360 --> 46:54.620
Jo from Perth … Kay.

46:54.620 --> 47:03.060
Kay from Canberra.

47:03.060 --> 47:32.170
Now we have shirts for the boys, of leaders
of all the – what do you call it? – ashrams;

47:32.170 --> 47:43.190
so you read the name.

47:43.190 --> 48:05.080
And now you all

48:05.080 --> 48:44.890
should try it, whichever fits you, and I don’t
know!

48:44.890 --> 49:38.080
First do it, first you people do it, all right.

49:38.080 --> 50:29.100
Come along, Cairns, come along.

50:29.100 --> 50:39.300
Select.

50:39.300 --> 51:09.910
Whichever fits you.

51:09.910 --> 51:33.820
These are all loose ones, so they’ll fit
anyone … Good … All right, take any one.

51:33.820 --> 51:36.860
Looks nice – beautiful!

51:36.860 --> 51:38.880
All right ….

51:38.880 --> 51:40.900
With embroidery!

51:40.900 --> 51:44.950
... May God bless you.

51:44.950 --> 51:49.000
Take whichever you like.

51:49.000 --> 51:56.510
That’s a good one!

51:56.510 --> 52:06.240
… Of course, Burwood.

52:06.240 --> 52:26.750
What about the New Zealand people?

52:26.750 --> 52:39.910
Auckland ... All right.

52:39.910 --> 53:04.320
That’s fine ... All right, take it up …

53:04.320 --> 53:07.730
Oh, blue?

53:07.730 --> 53:25.820
You like green … So Melbourne has no, because
– Melbourne has no ashram so far.

53:25.820 --> 53:26.820
Yes.

53:26.820 --> 53:32.340
So they have to have ashram.

53:32.340 --> 53:47.480
This is a special gift for Mr Stephen from
the leader of Hariyana, Mr Gupta, who has

53:47.480 --> 53:59.580
been so kind to bring all these things through
your Customs.

53:59.580 --> 54:18.630
So now we should disperse, I think, and tomorrow
is there’s puja.

54:18.630 --> 54:28.140
If we want to start it’s about eleven o’clock,
but try to be there, make preparations, I’ll

54:28.140 --> 54:30.430
be ready here to come.

54:30.430 --> 54:36.280
I’ll be ready, very ready to come there,
but the problem is sometimes it’s not ready.

54:36.280 --> 54:39.380
So we have told everybody eleven o’clock
we are starting the puja.

54:39.380 --> 54:46.250
But let’s see how you do it, because the
preparation takes so much time.

54:46.250 --> 54:49.260
All right?

54:49.260 --> 54:53.770
May God bless.

54:53.770 --> 54:56.930
I gave it today because tomorrow is My birthday;
I’m not supposed to give any presents on

54:56.930 --> 54:57.930
My birthday!

54:57.930 --> 55:01.770
(So finish it off now?)

55:01.770 --> 55:08.870
Good night, everybody.

55:08.870 --> 55:13.600
Sleep early!

55:13.600 --> 55:25.440
Hello, hello, how are you?

55:25.440 --> 55:32.780
[Child: My father’s here.]

55:32.780 --> 55:37.760
Which one?

55:37.760 --> 55:50.190
… Deep, deep, deep sleep, eh?

55:50.190 --> 55:57.660
What’s your name?

55:57.660 --> 56:00.140
[Shridhara.]

56:00.140 --> 56:05.119
Shridhara, eh?

56:05.119 --> 56:10.810
And you are really Shridhara!

56:10.810 --> 56:13.040
He’s very good at acting!

56:13.040 --> 56:19.520
All these children can be really trained up
so well, as they are born-realized.

56:19.520 --> 56:30.410
So you will come to India to study?

56:30.410 --> 56:34.490
To ride horses?

56:34.490 --> 56:37.210
…. Yes, yes.

56:37.210 --> 56:57.220
You don’t have to wear in India, there is
no need, but we can get you some hats also

56:57.220 --> 57:02.660
… They’ll fit you all right.

57:02.660 --> 57:15.610
They make hats for every size of head!

57:15.610 --> 57:20.360
All right.

57:20.360 --> 57:29.859
May God bless you.
