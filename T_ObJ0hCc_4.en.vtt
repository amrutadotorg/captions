Talk to Sahaja Yogis
Eve of Birthday Puja

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.510
Sydney, Australia
March 20th, 1990

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.180
So My tour of Australia has come to an end.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.970
Today is a day I can say it’s all very well
done.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.150
We have had very good response; I didn’t
expect that much everywhere.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:38.030
It was tremendous and very great things have
happened, some miracles also, during this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.810
visit.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:50.740
And one has to know that Sahaja yogis have
to be with great potential manifesting.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:58.660
If they are, then it triggers very well; otherwise
I cannot work out.

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:05.720
For that we have to understand that in Sahaja
Yoga there’s no sacrifice of any kind.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.360
Don’t have to sacrifice anything, it’s
all the time blessings throughout.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.210
You don’t have to sacrifice anything, and
you don’t have to suffer also anything – nothing

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.570
of the kind.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:22.160
I have told you about how My father was in
jail, My mother was in jail and how many times,

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:29.090
and how we suffered during the war of independence.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.380
We lost everything, all our properties, everything,
for the war of independence only.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:43.000
But this is the independence, the freedom
of an absolute nature: not only for you but

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.320
for the whole world, for your children, for
everyone.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.080
It’s a tremendous work.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.000
It’s a very great achievement.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.030
In the history of spirituality, in the history
of the world this is the greatest thing that

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.100
has happened, is that people are transformed
into a new awareness.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.810
Perhaps you are not aware of it.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.640
And we take it for granted, we don’t understand
the importance of it; and we get lost into

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.930
smaller, smaller things and very wasteful
things which are of no value.

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.060
How are these things will be going into the
history, you must understand that.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.860
And where do you stand in that history?

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.730
What will you be called?

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.280
So now first of all there were problems with
the leaders.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.410
All right.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.700
But there were some who stuck on to it.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.600
They didn’t give it up.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.560
They did not give it up because the leaders
were bad.

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.930
Nobody wrote to Me, all right, but they stuck
on.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:55.790
But those who went away, why didn’t they
write to Me why they went away?

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.640
This is an escape from reality.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.150
This is an escape, to say that there was something
wrong with the the ashram people, there was

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.680
something wrong with the leaders – of course,
it was.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.710
But you should have written to Me – why
didn’t you write to Me?

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:21.100
Why did you take such decisions on your own,
and just left the Sahaja Yoga into lurch?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.410
We have to be people of quality, otherwise
Sahaja Yoga won’t work out.

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:34.030
It’s not meant for people who are mediocres.

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.080
If there are few, doesn’t matter; but there
have to be people of quality, that is one

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.520
thing for sure.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:44.570
Now I have seen that everywhere people have
taken here a view that it’s better to have

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.570
separate houses.

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:52.520
I mean, this is another absurd view: from
where it has come into your heads, I don’t

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.520
know.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.200
Absolutely absurd, against Sahaj, it’s most
asahaj view.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.030
Today only I was reading, five old ladies
were killed by one man, because they were

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.540
living alone in every house.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:14.350
Such violence, such horrible atmosphere everywhere.

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.880
Even for security it’s better that you live
together, at least eight people, ten people

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.220
together.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:27.370
There’s no sacrifice in it, there’s no
sacrifice.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.680
On the contrary if you live together as I’ve
told you, you save money, your children are

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.669
looked after; if somebody’s pregnant she’s
looked after, there’s somebody to look after

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.349
you.

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:41.159
But what is the gain of having another house,
I don’t understand.

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:51.590
You have to work much harder, pay much more,
but a kind of a ego satisfaction is there.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.919
And then they develop problems, I have seen:
we’ve got cancer, we’ve got heart attacks,

00:04:56.919 --> 00:05:00.499
we’ve got this, “my son has run away”,
that has happened, that has happened.

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:06.020
All this arbitrary behavior, and I am supposed
to be sort of responsible for everything.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.220
It’s a complete liability, once somebody
comes to Sahaja Yoga, then he is a liability

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:12.220
on us.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.460
But he has no responsibilities and he has
no duties – only I have.

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:20.589
That’s not proper.

00:05:20.589 --> 00:05:27.789
So now I have to tell you today very frankly
that you all have to live together, at least

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:31.990
eight to ten people in a place.

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:36.419
And don’t fight, and don’t create groups.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:40.699
Group-making is a very wrong thing.

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.419
Before making any group you write to Me.

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:51.110
You are all welcome to write to Me, and I’ll
attend to that letter if it is worth attending,

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.800
because I know everything through vibrations.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.860
Don’t talk against each other.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.819
It’s a murmuring souls, and Christ has said
such people will go to hell.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:04.919
It’s not hell outside, I tell you, it will
be the hell here.

00:06:04.919 --> 00:06:07.409
It’s hell here.

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:08.810
I have seen people suffering.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.270
I have been so frightened, you have no idea.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.039
Don’t play about with Sahaja Yoga at all.

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:19.759
I’m just warning you, it’s a very serious
thing.

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:25.560
People have got heart attacks, have got accidents,
have got cancers, all kinds of things, and

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:30.089
really I am quite frightened that you people
don’t realize that there is another force

00:06:30.089 --> 00:06:31.639
working it out.

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:33.379
Don’t take arbitrary decisions.

00:06:33.379 --> 00:06:36.119
You are very safe in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:36.119 --> 00:06:40.150
Stay in Sahaja Yoga, grow in Sahaja Yog, enjoy
in Sahaja Yog.

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.240
Everything is there available for you.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:48.740
And you don’t have to do anything else except
that keep together: it’s a collective happening.

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:50.750
It’s a collective.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:59.300
If you are not in the collective, the Divine
is not interested in you at all – you are

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:02.389
out of it.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:09.449
Only the collective gets the power, only the
collective is magnetic.

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:14.789
Single person who lives away from collective
all the time, is something wrong with that

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:15.789
person.

00:07:15.789 --> 00:07:18.740
If you cannot be collective, there’s something
wrong.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.819
Such a person should sit down and find out
what’s wrong with that person, must get

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:26.719
it corrected, absolutely corrected.

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:31.610
And see to it that you are all right; because
this is for your benevolence.

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:39.060
You want to lead a happy, healthy, good life,
then be sensible, have some wisdom about it.

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:43.979
And so some people who have been negative
are still negative, and just thinking on the

00:07:43.979 --> 00:07:45.839
same lines.

00:07:45.839 --> 00:07:53.110
So it’s high time all of you have to work
it out sensibly, and understanding.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:08:04.139
There are leaders because I have to have communication,
that’s all.

00:08:04.139 --> 00:08:06.009
And they will communicate to Me about you
people.

00:08:06.009 --> 00:08:08.180
If there are problems, they will try to solve
you.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.539
If they cannot solve it, they’ll write to
Me and I’ll have to see to it.

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:19.569
There’s not going to be any regimentation
in Sahaja Yoga at all; it is a thing of love.

00:08:19.569 --> 00:08:21.150
But you must have love for yourself.

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:23.939
I mean, you should be self-disciplined.

00:08:23.939 --> 00:08:28.919
Now imagine how I must have felt: I have come
here, I’ve worked so hard for so many times

00:08:28.919 --> 00:08:32.520
I have been here, and when I come here what
I find, everything is broken down.

00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:36.640
It’s so sad – I’ve worked so hard.

00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:43.269
But next time I am going to see you all settled
down in proper ashrams, in different place.

00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:47.800
Not for your own comfort you should think,
but if you have an ashram you put a center

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.800
there.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:51.220
Every place you can have a center.

00:08:51.220 --> 00:08:56.120
In Bombay, I don’t know, we have eighteen
or twenty-one centers, in Bombay.

00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.790
That’s how it increases, and improves it.

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:04.490
You have centers everywhere, so it’s available
to people all the time.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:09.430
You would talk about it, meet every day, evening
time you all can meet, talk to each other;

00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:13.279
and you have one day in a week somewhere,
in a school or something, big place where

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.699
you all meet.

00:09:14.699 --> 00:09:18.839
The more you meet, the more there is rapport,
the more there is collectivity, the more there

00:09:18.839 --> 00:09:23.449
are blessings for each one of you, and for
all of you.

00:09:23.449 --> 00:09:29.730
It absolutely simultaneously works out; whilst
when there is no collectivity – no.

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:33.700
When there is collectivity, everything works
out.

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.650
Everything is available to you.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:41.589
So don’t try to break the collectivity by
forming any groups or anything – nothing

00:09:41.589 --> 00:09:44.850
of the kind.

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.700
If you find anything wrong you have to write
to Me.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:54.110
But it’s everybody’s responsibility is
to sustain the collectivity, to support it,

00:09:54.110 --> 00:09:55.779
to help it.

00:09:55.779 --> 00:10:01.490
If you find that somebody is talking about
somebody else, then you say, “No, no, he

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:03.550
was talking very good about you.

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:08.870
Why are you talking ill about that person?”

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:13.990
This is what, this is what Christ has said,
that these are peacemakers.

00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:18.350
But somebody says something about someone
– oh, then you go into, “Ho, ho, ho, that

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:21.400
one is like this,” then another one.

00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:28.589
We are not like common people, we are not
ordinary people, we are saints.

00:10:28.589 --> 00:10:35.800
We are to respect each other, to love each
other, to understand and enjoy each other.

00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:39.149
What will the children say tomorrow?

00:10:39.149 --> 00:10:43.000
So nobody should get away with this idea that
we can have separate houses, live separately

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.660
and we are all right.

00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:48.470
Better take out all My photographs from them;
they have no business.

00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:52.630
At least eight persons should be there in
one household, at least, minimum.

00:10:52.630 --> 00:10:54.839
Eight to ten people is a good idea.

00:10:54.839 --> 00:10:59.300
There’s no safety, there’s no progress,
there’s nothing in such houses where they

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:00.900
live alone very nicely.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:06.350
Morning till evening they are cooking, cleaning,
sweeping, swabbing, looking after the car,

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:13.899
locking the house – what else are they doing?

00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:19.500
It’s so boring to be alone, it’s extremely
boring.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.740
Now I have already told you very clearly that
we have to live together.

00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:29.470
And let the children know each other, know
everyone, they should know about their friendship.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:35.250
And you know, it is so nice the way they love
each other and the way they talk to each other,

00:11:35.250 --> 00:11:39.230
and about their aunties and uncles they talk
so sweetly.

00:11:39.230 --> 00:11:44.290
So many aunties and uncles to have is something
so remarkable; to have so many nephews and

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:49.779
nieces all over.

00:11:49.779 --> 00:11:53.509
And unless and until you have that kind of
a feeling, it won’t work out.

00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:56.959
Then if somebody finds something wrong with
your child and tells you, don’t get angry

00:11:56.959 --> 00:11:59.629
for that – thank him.

00:11:59.629 --> 00:12:00.629
Try to improve your child.

00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:03.850
The improvement of your child is for the benevolence
of the child.

00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:04.850
Not to feel bad: “this is my child.”

00:12:04.850 --> 00:12:06.230
This “my” business has to go a little
bit; then I will come.

00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:14.280
If there is “my house”, “my children”,
“my car”, “my” this, this has to go

00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.560
away.

00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:29.089
Let us see how we start diverting our energies
to a collective beauty, collective love, collective

00:12:29.089 --> 00:12:30.730
understanding.

00:12:30.730 --> 00:12:34.520
And if it is not, there’s something wrong
with you, take it from Me, something wrong.

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:40.399
So either you are right-sided or left-sided:
find out and just get yourself cleared out.

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:46.960
Treat it out yourself, and you will understand
that there was something wrong with you, nothing

00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:52.319
wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:52.319 --> 00:12:59.010
All such ideas are going to completely blast
Sahaja Yoga and finish it off.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:07.259
They are selfish, self-oriented, absolutely
out-of-date ideas for Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:07.259 --> 00:13:14.149
You can have one room each other, for each
one of them and you can stay together, and

00:13:14.149 --> 00:13:17.209
you can have somebody as a leader, whomsoever
you want.

00:13:17.209 --> 00:13:22.209
If you want we can do rotation of leaders
later on if you like that, can be done also.

00:13:22.209 --> 00:13:25.720
But still I would say that unless and until
there is something wrong with the leader,

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:31.709
it’s not proper to remove such a leader.

00:13:31.709 --> 00:13:34.000
But whatever you suggest, I don’t mind,
but we have to have someone who is looking

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.560
after you, and informing Me about it.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:47.690
But the wife of the leader is never a leader,
understand that, it’s only the leader is

00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:48.690
the leader.

00:13:48.690 --> 00:13:51.550
Whether it’s the husband or a wife of a
leader is not a leader, and she should never

00:13:51.550 --> 00:13:52.980
behave like that.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:14:00.300
She has to be very motherly, kindly, and all
the time looking after all the people in a

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.569
more gentler way than the husband himself.

00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:09.029
That’s the sign of a good wife of a leader.

00:14:09.029 --> 00:14:17.440
We have some, we have such women, and wherever
there have been good ashrams, Sahaja Yoga

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.240
has prospered.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:22.879
It has gone up to the governments, it has
gone up to the intellectuals, it has gone

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:29.490
up to such areas where we would never expect
it, anywhere there has been.

00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:41.350
And most of the people now are in the ashrams,
in the whole world.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:48.620
I hope you all understand the importance of
it.

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:54.920
Anything goes wrong with anyone here, immediately
the telephone comes, that something has gone

00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:56.490
wrong with such and such person is sick.

00:14:56.490 --> 00:14:59.149
Then I can tell you what is to be done, how
to get that person cured.

00:14:59.149 --> 00:15:04.379
But supposing you are in some other house
…. It happened like this, one fellow was

00:15:04.379 --> 00:15:06.959
like that and he met with an accident.

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:08.490
Met with an accident, nobody knew.

00:15:08.490 --> 00:15:13.740
He was lying in the hospital – when he came
to his consciousness he called for somebody,

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.999
then they told Me.

00:15:18.999 --> 00:15:23.709
It’s like one family, it’s like one body.

00:15:23.709 --> 00:15:26.110
If something hurts here, every – the whole
body knows.

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:29.310
You must know how many there are with us.

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:32.480
You feel so strong and happy.

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:38.029
But first of all you must develop that rapport,
you must develop that love, must develop that

00:15:38.029 --> 00:15:39.199
personality.

00:15:39.199 --> 00:15:43.990
Now those who are left-sided, I’ve already
told them what treatment they have to take,

00:15:43.990 --> 00:15:45.889
and take it seriously.

00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:50.540
Left-sidedness should not be allowed to grow
at all – I tell you, it’s very dangerous.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:55.420
All these horrible diseases that you have
heard of, all of them, one and all – say

00:15:55.420 --> 00:16:04.519
epilepsy, mental derangements, you can say
cancer, all psychosomatic, this myelitis,

00:16:04.519 --> 00:16:12.029
then there are other diseases like AIDS, all
that – attack only left-sided people.

00:16:12.029 --> 00:16:16.010
Anybody who has left side, immediately try
to get rid of that left side.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:20.990
The right side shows so everybody knows, and
you can throw away such a person, or you can

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.990
correct it.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:25.089
But the left side be very careful, don’t
play about with the left side.

00:16:25.089 --> 00:16:29.620
Left side is very dangerous.

00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:35.509
To avoid that, don’t mix up with people
who are mentally deranged, don’t go to the

00:16:35.509 --> 00:16:42.160
hospitals where such people live, don’t
try to cure people who are left-sided – they

00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.470
can be all cured on My photograph.

00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:52.709
And if somebody starts telling too much about
their woes and all that, just shut your ears.

00:16:52.709 --> 00:17:01.240
All this left side comes from a kind of a
self-indulgence, in the sense that you start

00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:06.800
thinking you are so miserable, you are so
unhappy, you are no good, and all that.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:12.490
So the right-sided are over-confident, the
left-sided are diffident.

00:17:12.490 --> 00:17:16.790
But they’re, because they’re diffident,
you see, all kinds of viruses can attack.

00:17:16.790 --> 00:17:21.740
And these viruses are the thing which bring
forth diseases which cannot be cured.

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.750
So be careful on that point.

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:27.930
The right-sided people trouble others.

00:17:27.930 --> 00:17:33.280
The left-sided trouble themselves, and the
right-sided trouble others.

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:39.200
They try to show off, they want to – just
think they’re too much.

00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:45.520
First sign of a right-sided is that he starts
suddenly shouting, or giving lectures also,

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:47.810
that’s another one.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:53.350
Thirdly, he tries to show off that he’s
a very big, great Sahaja yogi.

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:56.560
There’s nobody great in Sahaja Yoga, everybody
is just the same.

00:17:56.560 --> 00:18:02.600
Just like all fingers are the same, every
cell is the same, everybody is the same.

00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:09.440
So nobody higher and lower, there’s no hierarchy
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:15.530
Everybody must understand that we are all
one, part and parcel of one body, and we don’t

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:20.100
have to consider ourself higher or lower.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:27.380
So there are so many ways of expression of
these boastful, right-sided people.

00:18:27.380 --> 00:18:32.810
And we can pull their legs – all right,
allowed!

00:18:32.810 --> 00:18:38.010
If somebody boasts too much you just pull
their legs, that’s allowed.

00:18:38.010 --> 00:18:43.490
That’s how in India nobody can have ego,
because from very childhood if somebody tries

00:18:43.490 --> 00:18:47.570
to show off, pull their legs.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.710
If somebody talks loudly, pull their legs.

00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:53.080
If somebody laughs loudly, pull their legs.

00:18:53.080 --> 00:19:00.650
I mean, anything somebody tries to do, overdo,
just pull their legs.

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:06.200
So it doesn’t behoove for a Sahaja yogi
to be like that.

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:13.930
Sahaja yogi has to be very dignified; otherwise
why will people come to Sahaja Yoga, if we

00:19:13.930 --> 00:19:17.000
are just like them?

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:23.160
We have to be exceptional, isn’t it?

00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:34.510
And that’s what is what I call dignified,
loving, affectionate, kind, sweet – that’s

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:40.130
what is the beauty.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:47.580
So anybody who shouts, screams, gets angry,
full of anger, this thing, bring one pin and

00:19:47.580 --> 00:19:53.250
just prick it – allowed!

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:56.090
And if he says anything, it’s to prick your
ego.

00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:58.900
Show the pins, you see, like this.

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:08.620
He’ll understand, “All right, this is
what I have.”

00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:15.910
So when you make a fun of a person who is
egoist he may not like it; but you show him

00:20:15.910 --> 00:20:19.340
a pin, he’ll understand, “Oh God, I have
got it!”

00:20:19.340 --> 00:20:21.840
They are quite aware of their ego, they don’t
want to have it.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:28.830
There was a gentleman from Delhi, his son
wrote to Me saying that “My father says

00:20:28.830 --> 00:20:34.720
that he’s not allowed to speak at all, and
he’s feeling very sad about it.”

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.040
So in the lecture I said that nobody is allowed
to speak.

00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:48.630
After My tape, meditate, stay in that meditative
mood, and go home.

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:53.120
Not that just after meditation, “Oh, what
cake I am going to have?” – all rush to

00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:54.120
the kitchen.

00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:57.500
So it’s surprising, even Indians are surprised
at it.

00:20:57.500 --> 00:21:01.420
India, people don’t get so much to eat,
but they are not hankering so much after food.

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:05.410
Here the first attention is in the kitchen,
all the time they are in the kitchen.

00:21:05.410 --> 00:21:10.520
How many times you take your tea is important.

00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:12.380
You should count how many times you are in
the kitchen.

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:17.650
I mean, you are still little babies, I tell
you, in that respect.

00:21:17.650 --> 00:21:22.630
I don’t think I have ever opened a fridge
to take out even water for Myself – I mean,

00:21:22.630 --> 00:21:29.600
since I remember My life, never.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:34.250
So this hankering after food is also another
funny thing that is.

00:21:34.250 --> 00:21:38.190
After meditation people just get up and go
to eat.

00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:40.710
You must sit down, meditate.

00:21:40.710 --> 00:21:46.740
Now after meditation if people start giving
speeches, then the people are anxious to go

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:54.450
to the kitchen, here’s somebody giving lectures,
so big problem starts between the two.

00:21:54.450 --> 00:21:58.260
They don’t like it, because they think,
“Oh, there’s a cake there, there’s something

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:03.790
biryani kept, and here it is this gentleman
is trying to give us a lecture.”

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:05.350
No one likes it.

00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:10.000
But it should be something very different,
that we are in meditative mood, how can we

00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.300
come out of it?

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:15.930
So I’d better tell you a story of Janaka,
which is very important.

00:22:15.930 --> 00:22:21.320
He was the one, in the beginning at the time
of Shri Rama, He was the father-in-law of

00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.549
Shri Rama, His name was Raja Janaka.

00:22:23.549 --> 00:22:26.230
And He was a king.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:28.760
So all the saints used to come and bow to
Him.

00:22:28.760 --> 00:22:34.140
And He was a king, He used to live like a
king.

00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:39.210
So one fellow, Nachiketa asked his guru, he
said, “What is this, you bow to this Raja?

00:22:39.210 --> 00:22:44.310
He has got all the wealth, He has got everything,
wears all the ornaments, He has all pomp and

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:45.310
show.

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:48.020
Why should you, a saint like you, go and bow
to Him?”

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:49.380
He said “He’s videhi.

00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:51.090
He’s so detached, He’s videhi.

00:22:51.090 --> 00:22:53.140
He doesn’t exist in His body.”

00:22:53.140 --> 00:22:54.170
He couldn’t understand.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:57.230
He said, “All right, I’ll go and see Him.”

00:22:57.230 --> 00:23:02.460
So he went and told Him that “I want to
become self-realized, as You are.”

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:05.750
He said, “You ask Me everything; I can give
you, but no self-realization.”

00:23:05.750 --> 00:23:10.640
“All right, we’ll see about it,” he
said.

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.300
So one day they were having a bath.

00:23:12.300 --> 00:23:16.930
He said, “Let’s go to the river, we’ll
have our bath.”

00:23:16.930 --> 00:23:22.270
So He took this boy, they were sitting and
having the bath, when some people came and

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:29.640
told that “Your palace is burning, and everybody
is running away.”

00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:33.750
So He was still in meditative mood, He wouldn’t
listen.

00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:38.240
Then they came back again, shouted, “See
now, Your wife and children all are, have

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:43.730
come out of it and they are all running away,
because the whole thing is getting burned.”

00:23:43.730 --> 00:23:46.310
Still He was in meditative mood, least bothered.

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:54.980
Then they said, “Now the fire is coming
this side, and what are You doing?”

00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:57.220
So Nachiketa got up and he caught hold of
his clothes.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.400
He thought, “I should wear my clothes at
least, they’ll be burnt.”

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:03.650
He was still meditating.

00:24:03.650 --> 00:24:07.190
Then Nachiketa realized that He is videhi.

00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:12.580
That’s why Sitaji is called as Vaidehi,
because She is the daughter of a videhi.

00:24:12.580 --> 00:24:14.360
And that’s what we have to be.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.690
“Where is our attention?” we should say.

00:24:16.690 --> 00:24:20.270
You are meditating, take it deep down into
yourself.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:23.390
That’s a meditative mood.

00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:26.380
Keep yourself there.

00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.950
And after meditation you just get up silently,
sit for a while.

00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:37.361
I think best thing will be to have your food
first and then meditate, if that is so, if

00:24:37.361 --> 00:24:38.920
you think that is proper.

00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:50.350
But I think if you have to get now into that
new triggering, as I told you, into that new

00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:55.740
jumping that we have to do in Sahaja Yoga:
if you have to catch that train, then you

00:24:55.740 --> 00:24:57.700
hurry up.

00:24:57.700 --> 00:25:00.000
You have to change all these ideas.

00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:04.110
You have had many houses, you have had many
wives and many children in your previous life.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:08.130
You never had your realization – now you
have got it.

00:25:08.130 --> 00:25:14.910
So now just every individual, every one of
you should not think of others, think of yourself,

00:25:14.910 --> 00:25:21.170
“I have to do it, I have to get it, I have
to work it out.”

00:25:21.170 --> 00:25:23.290
This is what you have to do.

00:25:23.290 --> 00:25:25.130
“Why should I miss it?”

00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:30.720
This is a chance of many lives, the chance
of many lives.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:37.110
And that’s how you can jump over, and work
it out.

00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:44.970
We had lots of people in Australia, and if
they had worried about themselves as to “what

00:25:44.970 --> 00:25:46.630
I have done for Sahaja Yoga.”

00:25:46.630 --> 00:25:50.790
So in the morning you just decide, what I
am going to do for Sahaja Yog and myself;

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:56.080
in the evening, what have I done for myself,
and what have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:00.110
“Myself” doesn’t mean selfishness, but
“for my ascent.”

00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:01.110
Every day.

00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:04.300
You start a diary to write it down.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.590
You face yourself.

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.890
No excuses, nothing.

00:26:06.890 --> 00:26:12.330
If you are left behind, what we can do?

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:16.610
We can’t help it.

00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:21.230
And that is how you’ll find all kinds of
blessings will come to you.

00:26:21.230 --> 00:26:26.350
You’ll be able to save money, you’ll be
able to save time, you’ll get good jobs.

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:33.200
All your problems can be solved if you really
surrender yourself to that Paramachaitanya.

00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.640
Everything can be done.

00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:41.620
But as long as you have this narrow-mindedness
and these narrow ideas about yourself, till

00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:43.800
then it won’t work out.

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:49.510
This drop has to become one with the ocean,
then ocean takes over.

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:53.020
And I am sure that can work out.

00:26:53.020 --> 00:27:01.860
And you are basically a very good point here,
because you are born on the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:07.660
Basically it’s such an advantage for you,
much more than Russians have.

00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:12.340
But Russians, I don’t know how, they have
shot up so well.

00:27:12.340 --> 00:27:18.230
It’s an Agnya, it’s a right Agnya where
they have denied Christ, they have denied

00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:25.480
all religions, everything, and still they’re
prospering.

00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.090
So you are very well placed.

00:27:28.090 --> 00:27:32.890
And innocence can never be lost, can never
be lost, whatever you may try.

00:27:32.890 --> 00:27:42.910
Of course, there could be clouds, but they
get just into nothing, they just disappear.

00:27:42.910 --> 00:27:50.570
If you just try to clean off your innocence
and simplicity.

00:27:50.570 --> 00:27:54.501
And don’t think too much, “We should do
like this, we should organize like this, we

00:27:54.501 --> 00:27:56.630
should have this thing” – nothing of the
kind.

00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:58.860
Wherever you are, why to think?

00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.870
I never think, “Where I will sit?

00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:02.220
What will be My chair?

00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:03.250
How will I sleep?

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:04.850
How will I go there?”

00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:05.850
Nothing.

00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:09.360
Just exist.

00:28:09.360 --> 00:28:11.600
Just exist.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.280
Everything works out for good, you should
know.

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.920
Now, if you redden too much on your faces,
you should know you have left Vishuddhis.

00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.510
So first of all know that you are forgiven
for everything.

00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:24.890
Whatever you have done you are forgiven, just
remember.

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.270
You are forgiven completely, absolutely hundred
percent.

00:28:28.270 --> 00:28:31.610
There’s nothing to feel guilty about, nothing
to feel guilty.

00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:37.830
And you are loved, you’re looked after,
you’re cared for.

00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:44.480
Paramchaitanya cares, it’s a caring, caring
government, I should say.

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:49.040
It cares for you, looks after you, it manages
so many things.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:51.360
Unbelievable, it is.

00:28:51.360 --> 00:28:54.360
It manages, it works out.

00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.720
You must have heard about the story about
Cairns, what miracle has taken place, have

00:28:58.720 --> 00:28:59.720
you heard?

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.720
No?

00:29:00.720 --> 00:29:01.720
So … Kay.

00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:03.010
Where is Kay?

00:29:03.010 --> 00:29:18.170
I was – Kay, can you tell them?

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:31.180
Please come here.

00:29:31.180 --> 00:29:39.850
Just come.

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:52.860
It’s too much!

00:29:52.860 --> 00:30:03.480
[Kay: It was a great blessing for Shri Mataji
to come to Cairns for us, and we had the opportunity

00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:08.160
of taking Shri Mataji out to the Great Barrier
Reef.]

00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:11.280
Just we decided spontaneously.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:13.630
[Kay: Very spontaneously!

00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:17.900
We delayed Her flight and kept Her from the
Brisbane people for a few hours, just to keep

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:22.910
Her a little more time with us; but we thought
it was important that She put Her attention

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:28.460
on the reef, because there was a lot of problems
happening with this great natural phenomena

00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:31.090
off the coast of Cairns.

00:30:31.090 --> 00:30:37.120
And we took a fast boat out to the reef, and
Shri Mataji graciously agreed to go down into

00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.730
a semi-submersible and had a look at the reef.

00:30:41.730 --> 00:30:44.470
And just looking at it, all the fish came
around.

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:50.320
It was just a miracle to be in the reef with
Her, while She was looking at all this wonderful

00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:52.250
natural phenomena.

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:59.150
But within the next day the attention of the
people who had been researching the reef and

00:30:59.150 --> 00:31:04.590
been worried about the Crown-of-Thorns starfish
eating the reef, and all the pollution, suddenly

00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.970
they started to realize the reef was regenerating.

00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:13.240
And all the Crown-of-Thorns starfish were
dying and they didn’t know why, they didn’t

00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:17.600
know where they’d come from, and now they
don’t know where they’ve gone!]

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.990
They have written, it’s a mystery!

00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:22.780
[Kay: And they said it’s a mystery.

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:28.130
But just a glance from our Mother has just
made everything right.

00:31:28.130 --> 00:31:30.790
Jai Shri Mataji!]

00:31:30.790 --> 00:31:40.480
But you are not a coral reef, you see, you
are not that; because you see, I cannot, I

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.280
cannot transform you that way.

00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:44.690
You have to use your will power.

00:31:44.690 --> 00:31:50.160
They are all animals, you see, and animals
are under the control of God, that’s why

00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.470
they are called as “pashu”.

00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:54.020
This “pash” means all the bandhan.

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:59.330
Under the bandhan of God: is whatever God
wants can do with them, with the, all the

00:31:59.330 --> 00:32:03.940
plants, of animals, everyone.

00:32:03.940 --> 00:32:09.230
But with human beings you can’t do everything.

00:32:09.230 --> 00:32:12.830
And also to understand human beings is another
problem.

00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:15.970
I don’t know how suddenly they become so
funny.

00:32:15.970 --> 00:32:20.690
They are all right, going straight, and suddenly
you don’t know what happens to them.

00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:29.340
So it’s a thing that God has created, and
then adding to that, man has created himself

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:35.000
a little bit more – which is quite a difficult
thing to understand.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:39.691
So you better understand yourself, why you
do like that; and you have to with your free

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:41.990
will accept that “I have to do it.”

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:46.960
It is self disciplining and you’ll work
it out, and I’m sure one day you will show

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:53.850
that in Australia we have really achieved
a great height.

00:32:53.850 --> 00:32:57.350
Children are wonderful here, no doubt.

00:32:57.350 --> 00:33:05.660
Then another thing is that we have started
a school in India, with the idea that the

00:33:05.660 --> 00:33:12.330
amount you pay only for their food and clothes
per month, that much is about to be charged

00:33:12.330 --> 00:33:15.200
for them.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.800
And they’ll have the best education of a
private school, with all other facilities

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:22.950
like horse-riding, swimming and every sort
of thing.

00:33:22.950 --> 00:33:25.370
Music, dancing, everything can be taught to
them.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:30.800
And the amount will be the same, practically
as much as you’ll be spending on one child

00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:34.460
per month here, only for keeping them in the
house.

00:33:34.460 --> 00:33:39.450
So it would be like going to a general school.

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:42.550
Of course, the transport and everything we’ll
look after.

00:33:42.550 --> 00:33:48.850
Now for this we have – as it is, you have
paid some money, and others have also paid

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:51.780
– and we have made a good arrangement now.

00:33:51.780 --> 00:33:53.850
The school has started.

00:33:53.850 --> 00:33:58.621
With this kind of a school, the parents can
go and see their children for a month, two

00:33:58.621 --> 00:34:01.660
months, whichever way you like, and stay there
with them.

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:07.210
Or if you want you can take them out to Himalayas,
whichever way you want to do.

00:34:07.210 --> 00:34:11.659
But till the age of sixteen years I am thinking
the children should not be exposed to this

00:34:11.659 --> 00:34:17.520
funny type of a country where they are just
trying to destroy them, because we have tried

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.520
that also.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:24.160
When the children go back to parents, they
come back with great problems, so it’s difficult.

00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:27.550
So now to think “they are my children”
– if you really think they are your children,

00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:31.960
for their benevolence you must sacrifice.

00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:37.490
Maybe a little money you might have to sacrifice,
but more this feeling that “they are my

00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:38.490
children.”

00:34:38.490 --> 00:34:40.169
They’re actually Mine.

00:34:40.169 --> 00:34:45.530
And this will really help you a lot.

00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:51.700
You will be free here to do what you like,
you have more time for meditation, spreading

00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:56.090
Sahaja Yoga – because we are now on sort
of a warpath.

00:34:56.090 --> 00:35:02.970
And we have to make these children so good
that wherever they go they will not take to

00:35:02.970 --> 00:35:04.510
drugs, they will not take to bad things.

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:07.370
On the contrary, they’ll be very great Sahaja
yogis.

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:10.220
Maybe we might start a university later.

00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:12.990
But just up to sixteen years, it’s guaranteed.

00:35:12.990 --> 00:35:17.300
So now we have started for only, I think,
seven-year-old children a school now near

00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:22.020
Himalaya; and also now we are going to bring
it down.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:26.100
But now after three years or so we’ll be
starting school for all classes.

00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:31.210
For all classes we’ll be starting in a big
way, and we’ll be having best teachers and

00:35:31.210 --> 00:35:34.020
best timings, and we’ll look after them.

00:35:34.020 --> 00:35:39.430
Only thing is that if the Cambridge University
accepts then we’ll have the Cambridge University

00:35:39.430 --> 00:35:43.590
affiliation, because Indian standards are
too high, very high.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:45.860
They have to work really very hard for that.

00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:48.120
I would prefer Cambridge better.

00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.290
So they might agree to do that for us.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:55.940
That’s how our children can achieve a better
understanding of things, and they have more

00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:57.630
time for other things to do.

00:35:57.630 --> 00:36:00.930
So, so many things we are going to combine
there.

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:05.310
Basic education of Gandhiji I am going to
introduce into that, where children know so

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:12.650
much about the trees, about the plants, about
animals, about fishes, about the surroundings

00:36:12.650 --> 00:36:16.730
in which they live, about the Mother Earth,
about ecological problems and things like

00:36:16.730 --> 00:36:17.730
that.

00:36:17.730 --> 00:36:19.850
And we have to create really great leaders
out of them.

00:36:19.850 --> 00:36:24.500
So it is for you to decide now the children
that you want to send there.

00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:30.410
You can have children up to seven years here,
or six years here for your primary classes,

00:36:30.410 --> 00:36:32.150
but not for your high schools.

00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:34.840
But primary classes also we have.

00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:39.840
If you want to send your children for primary
classes we have that also, that we can look

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.010
after those children who are for primary classes.

00:36:42.010 --> 00:36:46.970
And there will be leave for the children for
two months or three months, I think, for which

00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:51.100
you can come there, or you can take them anywhere
you feel like.

00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.900
But I would not advise you to bring them back
here because it’s too much of an exposure,

00:36:54.900 --> 00:36:57.290
and you know what’s happening to your children.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:02.000
They’ll have to learn how to respect parents,
respect everything; and to get the intrinsic

00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:07.600
value of everything properly evaluated in
their minds, so that they do not become stupid.

00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:10.730
I’m sure this will work out very well.

00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:22.710
I have seen some children in Rome: they have
become so sensible, so developed, so beautiful.

00:37:22.710 --> 00:37:26.740
So money-wise also we might have to cut down
little expenses of yours, doesn’t matter;

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:29.910
for your children you have to do something.

00:37:29.910 --> 00:37:32.761
That’s the minimum they have worked it out.

00:37:32.761 --> 00:37:38.180
They said that per month it will be about
three hundred dollars for a child, inclusive

00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:42.090
of clothes, food, transport, everything, books,
everything.

00:37:42.090 --> 00:37:46.650
You don’t have to worry for their expenses
at all.

00:37:46.650 --> 00:37:52.370
You could give them some other clothes, but
they’ll have all their uniforms done by

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:58.850
them, books, shoes, everything will be done
in that amount, and education of every kind.

00:37:58.850 --> 00:38:03.350
All kinds of arts, crafts, depending on the
aptitude of the child.

00:38:03.350 --> 00:38:07.060
And you’ll see, they will be something very
unique children.

00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.480
So think it over.

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:13.730
And in that there is a lot of work entailed,
and some people are working it out.

00:38:13.730 --> 00:38:16.900
I’ll be getting some people from here also.

00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:28.170
And the whole process will be under My control,
so you don’t have to worry.

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:48.810
So now, I hope I’ll be coming next year
again.

00:38:48.810 --> 00:38:53.300
But for next year – I mean of course, not
this year – but next year we have decided

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:58.200
that it would be better to come here in the
month of April or May; because May is a better

00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:02.000
month here than March, and April is quite
hot.

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.190
So what do you say, April or May?

00:39:05.190 --> 00:39:06.190
May.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:07.190
May, all right.

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:15.900
But May, I can only come of fifth of May.

00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:28.030
After, I said, fifth of May, because we’ll
have one Sahasrara Day there and one here.

00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:34.760
And we can work it out that way to come by
May, so we can have one month of May spent

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760
here.

00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760
I would like to spend more time.

00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:42.600
But you must not have any more groups, quarrels,
fighting, problems with husband and wife.

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:46.800
I mean sometimes I feel, why did I marry them
to create these problems?

00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:51.840
They were all right without marriages!

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:56.310
So all these petty things should not be there.

00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:58.770
You should all be big, great people.

00:39:58.770 --> 00:40:03.850
I would like to come and see you here in your
ashrams and things; I would like to know what

00:40:03.850 --> 00:40:06.660
you have been doing, what creative work you
have been doing.

00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:08.630
It’s beautiful things you can do.

00:40:08.630 --> 00:40:09.630
All right?

00:40:09.630 --> 00:40:13.210
So with that hope, tomorrow we’ll have this
Birthday Puja.

00:40:13.210 --> 00:40:16.369
And everybody is quite jealous of you that
I’m having My birthday here!

00:40:16.369 --> 00:40:34.850
I love you Australians very much, and you
have to also love yourself and have proper

00:40:34.850 --> 00:40:36.230
value about yourself.

00:40:36.230 --> 00:40:43.670
Don’t fritter away your lives, don’t waste
them on nonsensical things, that’s very

00:40:43.670 --> 00:40:44.670
precious.

00:40:44.670 --> 00:40:49.730
If you were not precious, you would not have
come to Sahaja Yoga, remember that.

00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:51.430
You would have been by now in some pub!

00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:54.390
All right.

00:40:54.390 --> 00:40:58.800
Now, so few things we have here.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:09.070
Now, can you read out the lists …? [Hindi]
Come along.

00:41:09.070 --> 00:41:10.930
This ….

00:41:10.930 --> 00:41:33.070
You see, they told Me not to bring anything,
and because there is Customs, I think that

00:41:33.070 --> 00:41:40.160
the Customs torture My life for nothing at
all.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:43.330
There are Customs, this thing, that thing.

00:41:43.330 --> 00:41:48.750
So I’m thankful to Mr Gupta that he could
manage to bring some things for you.

00:41:48.750 --> 00:41:55.390
And I could only buy something in the duty-free
shop for you.

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:56.990
[Hindi]

00:41:56.990 --> 00:42:16.360
So first of all there’s a present for [Hindi]
… One for Stephen.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:37.310
These fountain pens are given to the leaders
so that they should write a letter to Me!

00:42:37.310 --> 00:42:52.130
Brian, Mr Brian.

00:42:52.130 --> 00:43:22.380
Now, others .… Cairns …. It’s all right,
I don’t read it.

00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:34.770
It’s all right … Melbourne … It’s
all right.

00:43:34.770 --> 00:43:39.890
So this is Perth.

00:43:39.890 --> 00:43:45.970
[Hindi] Brisbane.

00:43:45.970 --> 00:43:51.410
Brisbane is not here.

00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:58.300
We’ll keep it for Brisbane.What else?

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.290
Canberra is not here?

00:44:00.290 --> 00:44:02.190
All right, keep it.

00:44:02.190 --> 00:44:03.720
Who else?

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.720
Adelaide.

00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:09.070
For Adelaide, we should try still.

00:44:09.070 --> 00:44:14.980
I think it will work out now, things are better.

00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:16.360
Things are much better.

00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:25.380
It will work out.

00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:32.900
[Yogi: We have given You fifty-four macadamia
nut trees, for Your house in Prathisthan … for

00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:37.910
You to take back to India.]

00:44:37.910 --> 00:44:39.790
With Me?

00:44:39.790 --> 00:44:48.250
[Yogi: Yes, from the Adelaide collective,
for Your birthday.]

00:44:48.250 --> 00:44:53.890
Ah, I don’t think I can.

00:44:53.890 --> 00:44:58.820
But what you can do is to send them with these
people when they come.

00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:06.720
They can be kept here waiting?

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:32.960
There’s somewhere here, and they can bring
it when they come for the Ganapatipule, all

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.960
right?

00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.390
For the tour.

00:45:36.390 --> 00:45:38.110
All right?

00:45:38.110 --> 00:45:41.540
May God bless you.

00:45:41.540 --> 00:45:43.260
Thank you.

00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:44.970
All right.

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:45.970
[Hindi]

00:45:45.970 --> 00:46:03.010
So we start giving saris to ladies who looked
after Me ... Canberra.

00:46:03.010 --> 00:46:16.510
So she’s not come as yet?

00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:21.020
All right.

00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:27.180
Lyn, is she here?

00:46:27.180 --> 00:46:34.910
Lyn from Brisbane … Cheryl?

00:46:34.910 --> 00:46:43.360
… Sandya Sapate … Jo?

00:46:43.360 --> 00:46:54.620
Jo from Perth … Kay.

00:46:54.620 --> 00:47:03.060
Kay from Canberra.

00:47:03.060 --> 00:47:32.170
Now we have shirts for the boys, of leaders
of all the – what do you call it? – ashrams;

00:47:32.170 --> 00:47:43.190
so you read the name.

00:47:43.190 --> 00:48:05.080
And now you all

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:44.890
should try it, whichever fits you, and I don’t
know!

00:48:44.890 --> 00:49:38.080
First do it, first you people do it, all right.

00:49:38.080 --> 00:50:29.100
Come along, Cairns, come along.

00:50:29.100 --> 00:50:39.300
Select.

00:50:39.300 --> 00:51:09.910
Whichever fits you.

00:51:09.910 --> 00:51:33.820
These are all loose ones, so they’ll fit
anyone … Good … All right, take any one.

00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:36.860
Looks nice – beautiful!

00:51:36.860 --> 00:51:38.880
All right ….

00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.900
With embroidery!

00:51:40.900 --> 00:51:44.950
... May God bless you.

00:51:44.950 --> 00:51:49.000
Take whichever you like.

00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:56.510
That’s a good one!

00:51:56.510 --> 00:52:06.240
… Of course, Burwood.

00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:26.750
What about the New Zealand people?

00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:39.910
Auckland ... All right.

00:52:39.910 --> 00:53:04.320
That’s fine ... All right, take it up …

00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:07.730
Oh, blue?

00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:25.820
You like green … So Melbourne has no, because
– Melbourne has no ashram so far.

00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:26.820
Yes.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:32.340
So they have to have ashram.

00:53:32.340 --> 00:53:47.480
This is a special gift for Mr Stephen from
the leader of Hariyana, Mr Gupta, who has

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:59.580
been so kind to bring all these things through
your Customs.

00:53:59.580 --> 00:54:18.630
So now we should disperse, I think, and tomorrow
is there’s puja.

00:54:18.630 --> 00:54:28.140
If we want to start it’s about eleven o’clock,
but try to be there, make preparations, I’ll

00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:30.430
be ready here to come.

00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:36.280
I’ll be ready, very ready to come there,
but the problem is sometimes it’s not ready.

00:54:36.280 --> 00:54:39.380
So we have told everybody eleven o’clock
we are starting the puja.

00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:46.250
But let’s see how you do it, because the
preparation takes so much time.

00:54:46.250 --> 00:54:49.260
All right?

00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:53.770
May God bless.

00:54:53.770 --> 00:54:56.930
I gave it today because tomorrow is My birthday;
I’m not supposed to give any presents on

00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:57.930
My birthday!

00:54:57.930 --> 00:55:01.770
(So finish it off now?)

00:55:01.770 --> 00:55:08.870
Good night, everybody.

00:55:08.870 --> 00:55:13.600
Sleep early!

00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:25.440
Hello, hello, how are you?

00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:32.780
[Child: My father’s here.]

00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:37.760
Which one?

00:55:37.760 --> 00:55:50.190
… Deep, deep, deep sleep, eh?

00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:57.660
What’s your name?

00:55:57.660 --> 00:56:00.140
[Shridhara.]

00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:05.119
Shridhara, eh?

00:56:05.119 --> 00:56:10.810
And you are really Shridhara!

00:56:10.810 --> 00:56:13.040
He’s very good at acting!

00:56:13.040 --> 00:56:19.520
All these children can be really trained up
so well, as they are born-realized.

00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:30.410
So you will come to India to study?

00:56:30.410 --> 00:56:34.490
To ride horses?

00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:37.210
…. Yes, yes.

00:56:37.210 --> 00:56:57.220
You don’t have to wear in India, there is
no need, but we can get you some hats also

00:56:57.220 --> 00:57:02.660
… They’ll fit you all right.

00:57:02.660 --> 00:57:15.610
They make hats for every size of head!

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:20.360
All right.

00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:29.859
May God bless you.
