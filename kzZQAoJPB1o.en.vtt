Buddhism and Shri Buddha
(Questions &amp; Answers)

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:14.716
Shri Mataji: Have you done yoga very much?
Seeker: Sorry?

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:20.541
Shri Mataji: Have you done lot of yoga?
Seeker: Reasonable...

00:00:20.742 --> 00:00:25.739
I do follow a Buddhist practice which is
based upon the…

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:30.864
Shri Mataji: Now Buddhist also! Now
I’ll tell you about Buddhi, all right?

00:00:31.377 --> 00:00:36.819
What are Buddhists doing? It's true about
everyone Christians, Hindus, everybody.

00:00:37.028 --> 00:00:39.810
Just because you asked about Buddhist
I must tell you.

00:00:40.018 --> 00:00:43.699
Where is Buddha placed within us do
they know?

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:45.952
Where is Buddha?
Seeker: I’m sorry to say...

00:00:46.153 --> 00:00:49.574
Shri Mataji: Buddha is placed within us
at a point…

00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:55.743
Seeker: Well, yes… Shri Mataji: And what
does He control within us?

00:00:55.944 --> 00:01:01.266
We have to know this knowledge
of the roots.

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:04.342
Unless and until you know the knowledge
of the roots,

00:01:04.543 --> 00:01:06.477
how will you know about the tree?

00:01:06.678 --> 00:01:10.302
You cannot treat the tree on its leaves
or branches,

00:01:10.503 --> 00:01:15.255
you have to go to the roots. And first
you find out the roots within you.

00:01:15.456 --> 00:01:18.810
Buddhism is so superficial now, that I’m
Myself amazed

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:23.810
and Buddha must be thinking, “Oh God,
from where it has come?”.

00:01:24.486 --> 00:01:30.933
He said: “Buddham Sharanam Gachami.”
What is a Buddha? Is an enlightened soul.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:35.878
Buddham means the one who is enlightened.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.003
“Sangham sharanam gachami”, means
to the collective being.

00:01:39.204 --> 00:01:42.775
Sangham means the collective being.
“Dhammam sharanam gachami.”

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.043
Dhammam is the balance within you.
How many Buddhists know about it?

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.448
They don’t know even where Buddha
is sitting on their heads.

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:52.992
 And what I find most of the Buddhists

00:01:53.193 --> 00:01:56.162
that their center of Buddha is finished.

00:01:56.363 --> 00:01:59.663
Buddha has disappeared from there
once for all.

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:03.044
He controls our ego,

00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.881
and He is settled down here on the head
on the left hand side.

00:02:07.082 --> 00:02:13.132
We can prove it on Kundalini. Supposing
somebody is following Buddha

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:18.984
immediately people will know that you are
a Buddhist because there’s a catch here.

00:02:19.341 --> 00:02:22.265
And then some methods are there
to awaken Him.

00:02:22.466 --> 00:02:28.788
If you awaken Him your Kundalini will rise,
otherwise it won’t, all right?

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:34.578
So you must know the knowledge
of the roots.

00:02:36.206 --> 00:02:41.609
We should not just depend on Buddhism
or any “ism.”

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.726
Seeker: I know, yes, I agree...
Shri Mataji: That’s what I’m saying.

00:02:43.927 --> 00:02:46.820
Seeker: It’s just that the thing that You
said at the beginning,

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:50.202
I mean I agree with that…
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see we have to have

00:02:50.403 --> 00:02:56.374
the complete integrated knowledge
of the roots, which nourishes, you see?

00:02:56.575 --> 00:03:03.473
Seeker: I mean, are you advocating a system
or practice whereby one can

00:03:03.674 --> 00:03:14.296
get closer to these roots...?

00:03:14.497 --> 00:03:16.976
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. There is
no system about this.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.491
There is no system, no practice,
no courses. Actually it is spontaneous.

00:03:22.692 --> 00:03:25.492
I’m talking of your evolution.

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:31.226
Your evolution comes through a living force
of the living God.

00:03:31.388 --> 00:03:35.984
You cannot have a course in that,
can you have?

00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:39.038
How do you sprout a seed? You have to
just put it

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.765
in the Mother Earth it sprouts by itself,
is built in.

00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:45.632
In the same way within you it is built in

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:51.078
and it sprouts, that’s all. There’s
no course.

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:53.882
Maybe you may not get it today, you’ll
get it tomorrow,

00:03:54.083 --> 00:03:56.562
some seed sprouts faster.

00:03:56.763 --> 00:04:02.491
Seeker: ...what I see is this, the Buddhist
tradition anyway,

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:10.109
I mean, I see the Buddhist tradition
as growing out of a ancient yogic insight.

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:13.367
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no. You are sadly
mistaken about Buddhism.

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:17.140
The trouble is with the western people
they are so fed up with Christianity

00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:19.476
that they think Buddhism is going to solve
the problem.

00:04:19.677 --> 00:04:23.637
They are just like any other Christian
church, take it from Me.

00:04:23.838 --> 00:04:27.559
All these lamas should be hanged
by the nearest tree, I tell you.

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.650
Horrible people they are, horrible.
You should see their vibrations.

00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:34.236
You know this Dalai Lama when they’re
sitting next to Me,

00:04:34.437 --> 00:04:37.869
I was invited to the Prime Minister’s place,
I just couldn’t bear him.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:40.595
And the Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri
himself was a realized soul

00:04:40.796 --> 00:04:42.768
and he could feel it and he said,
“Is he very hot?”I said, “Yes.”

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:45.064
Is in Hindi he said, “He is an extremely
hot fellow.”

00:04:45.265 --> 00:04:46.792
He said, “All right, you get on the other
side,”

00:04:46.993 --> 00:04:50.590
he made the foreign minister sit there
with Me.

00:04:53.859 --> 00:04:56.267
You won’t understand now, just now you
don’t understand.

00:04:56.468 --> 00:05:00.158
Even a little child who’s a realized soul
will understand, but you won’t

00:05:00.359 --> 00:05:02.275
because you’re not yet realized, this is
the point.

00:05:02.476 --> 00:05:04.798
The difference is you are mentally
understanding.

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.986
I have a granddaughter, she was hardly
five years of age

00:05:08.187 --> 00:05:13.540
when My daughter and the son-in-law went
to Ladakh, it’s an interesting story.

00:05:13.741 --> 00:05:17.900
And there was a lama sitting you see like
this, and everybody was touching his feet.

00:05:18.101 --> 00:05:21.298
This little child, who is a realized soul,
she couldn’t bear it any more.

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:26.220
When the father went and touched his foot
she just stood back and she said,

00:05:26.421 --> 00:05:29.509
“What do you mean, by shaving your head
and wearing this big stuff

00:05:29.716 --> 00:05:31.760
you think you are a realized soul? Why are
you making everybody

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:35.720
touch your feet?” Just she stood up.

00:05:35.921 --> 00:05:38.917
And My son-in-law felt quite embarrassed
and he told that

00:05:39.118 --> 00:05:42.321
he’s not even a realized soul, why do you
touch his feet.

00:05:42.522 --> 00:05:43.845
You won’t understand,

00:05:44.046 --> 00:05:47.095
even a little child will understand,
you won’t understand.

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:51.001
Realized soul is a person who can feel it.

00:05:51.202 --> 00:05:54.376
This is what Buddha has said, that’s
the traditional thing, He has said,

00:05:54.577 --> 00:05:58.656
“First of all seek yourself.” Buddha didn’t
talk about God. Why?

00:05:58.857 --> 00:06:00.712
Because He thought if you talk about God
again

00:06:00.913 --> 00:06:04.212
another religion will start. He just said,
”First of all - as I say -

00:06:04.413 --> 00:06:08.431
first of all seek yourself, get your
Self-Realization.

00:06:10.177 --> 00:06:12.224
Nothing else but get your Realization.”

00:06:12.425 --> 00:06:14.605
Seeker: Oh yes, I mean…
Shri Mataji: All right, that’s it.

00:06:14.806 --> 00:06:17.337
So better have it, better have it.

00:06:17.538 --> 00:06:21.056
You see, to have Buddhism - there’s nothing
like “ism” about Buddha;

00:06:21.257 --> 00:06:26.352
you see, these people are mental -
to have it means to get Realization.

00:06:26.553 --> 00:06:30.002
What tradition are they following? Carrying
that ring like this, like that,

00:06:30.203 --> 00:06:33.056
mad kip (sick) people, horrible.

00:06:33.257 --> 00:06:37.331
Is that what Buddha did? He has sought
His Realization.

00:06:37.532 --> 00:06:40.259
He didn’t do all these nonsensical things
these lamas.

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.908
And they even beat people and do all kinds
of things,

00:06:43.109 --> 00:06:46.915
horrible cruel people. Thank God they are
out of that Lhasa.

00:06:47.116 --> 00:06:50.679
You should see the Tibetans, now they’re
sitting on our heads like parasites

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:55.790
in India and we had a parliament question
on them. You see, they look very attractive

00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:59.595
because you are fed up with your
Christianity, that’s what.

00:06:59.796 --> 00:07:02.351
Don’t believe in all these priests, whether
they are Hindus, Christians or Muslim,

00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:07.630
all are just the same. There’s
no difference.

00:07:07.831 --> 00:07:11.499
You become the realized soul first of all.

00:07:12.926 --> 00:07:19.071
You have to be the Buddha, all right?
That’s what I am saying as a Mother.

00:07:20.244 --> 00:07:23.266
And then they started another one Shambhala
business, you see?

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:27.399
This is another new thing. Taking everybody
to Gobi Desert

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:31.057
to get samadhi. Walk in that Gobi Desert
even one mile

00:07:31.258 --> 00:07:34.501
you will get a samadhi permanently.

00:07:34.702 --> 00:07:38.837
You can’t even get a glass of water there
to drink, My child.

00:07:39.038 --> 00:07:43.743
What things they are preaching, you don’t
know, all nonsense.

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:51.462
In Spain some Spanish people have started
this nonsense.

00:07:51.663 --> 00:07:54.884
They are recruiting people to go to Gobi
Desert.

00:07:55.085 --> 00:07:58.016
I mean, what is going to happen to them?
Think of the Gobi Desert,

00:07:58.209 --> 00:08:01.907
is one of the worst deserts of the world.

00:08:02.108 --> 00:08:06.820
Can you imagine going to a desert, how will
you reach God?

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:12.485
You have to seek Him within yourself.
He is within, all right?

00:08:18.168 --> 00:08:21.261
Is there any other question now?

00:08:22.119 --> 00:08:27.371
Put attention to that, that is important.

00:08:33.797 --> 00:08:38.269
But one thing more, when you follow them
you never ask questions.

00:08:38.470 --> 00:08:42.293
I had one lady from a lama, she came down
from Norway,

00:08:42.494 --> 00:08:45.550
she was horrid, absolutely horrid.

00:08:45.751 --> 00:08:49.044
Her vibrations were, what was her name,
Gavin? Gavin: Pia.

00:08:49.245 --> 00:08:54.316
Shri Mataji: Mia. Gavin: Pia. Yogi: Pia.
Shri Mataji: Pia. Pia.

00:08:54.517 --> 00:09:00.097
She came to My house, I said, “Baba! How
to raise her Kundalini, baba, dreadful.”

00:09:00.313 --> 00:09:01.800
And she was thinking no end of herself

00:09:02.001 --> 00:09:05.113
and arguing, arguing with Me throughout,
and all that.

00:09:05.314 --> 00:09:08.230
I said, “How did you happen,” I mean,
she has been to this lama.

00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:11.732
I said, “What happened?” She said, “No,
he wrote to us that I can’t live

00:09:11.933 --> 00:09:15.050
in an ordinary house, you have to make
a marble floor.

00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:17.839
So first we all starved ourselves,
within one year

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:21.105
we collected money, made a marble floor
for the fellow. So he came

00:09:21.306 --> 00:09:24.966
and was sitting on the seventh step,
and we were first one year

00:09:25.167 --> 00:09:28.419
we had to just go and bow to him just
like this.”

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:35.567
One thousand and one time, can you imagine,
every day. And “I’ve done that course.”

00:09:36.384 --> 00:09:38.519
But I said, “Didn’t you argue with him?”
She said, “No.”

00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.858
Then I said, “Why are you arguing
with Me?”.

00:09:42.572 --> 00:09:46.300
Of course, I like that you argue because
that shows you are free to argue,

00:09:46.501 --> 00:09:51.659
I’ve not mesmerized you, but you must
see the sense.

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:58.792
How do we accept Buddha, let’s see.
Have you seen Buddha?

00:10:01.507 --> 00:10:06.721
Have you met Him? Have you met anybody
who is a Buddhist

00:10:06.954 --> 00:10:10.957
who says he can give Realization?

00:10:12.899 --> 00:10:19.595
But then why are we the pleaders of Buddha
whom we have never seen,

00:10:19.796 --> 00:10:23.539
who has gone away, we don’t know anything
about Him. Why?

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:26.359
Because I’m living, He is not.
When He was living,

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:30.630
there were people who were asking about
other people to Him.

00:10:30.831 --> 00:10:32.799
So better be in the present

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:36.921
and get it your Realization, all right?
That’s what it is.
