WEBVTT

00:04.820 --> 00:10.780
This year we won’t be having, I think,

00:12.300 --> 00:17.300
public programs in UK,

00:18.341 --> 00:21.701
because also there are certain circumstances.

00:22.220 --> 00:25.540
But whenever there is a circumstance

00:25.740 --> 00:31.940
which, somehow or other, changes our programs,

00:32.220 --> 00:34.540
we must immediately know

00:34.740 --> 00:41.140
that there is a purpose behind all that change,

00:41.340 --> 00:44.780
and we must immediately accept it

00:45.100 --> 00:49.980
with an open heart – that Divine wants us to change.

00:50.180 --> 00:53.180
Supposing I am going on a road

00:53.380 --> 00:55.460
and people say, “You are lost your way Mother.”

00:55.660 --> 00:59.660
That’s all right. I am never lost, because I am with myself!

01:00.420 --> 01:05.700
But I had to go by that particular road, is the point.

01:05.940 --> 01:12.300
I had to do it, and that’s why I have…supposed to be,

01:12.780 --> 01:17.300
not on that road and I have lost my way.

01:17.740 --> 01:26.380
If you have that kind of a understanding,

01:26.940 --> 01:32.100
and if you have that satisfaction in your heart,

01:32.660 --> 01:37.460
then you’ll find life is worth much more than what you think it to be.

01:37.660 --> 01:44.660
Now, as it is, what was the reason, I thought,

01:44.940 --> 01:52.020
that we have decided to have public programs

01:53.300 --> 01:58.260
this year definitely, and we could not have public programs?

01:58.460 --> 02:03.580
So the reason is that we have to consolidate.

02:05.020 --> 02:11.540
In the growth of a tree, which is a living tree,

02:14.620 --> 02:23.100
it happens that it moves in a particular direction up to a point,

02:23.300 --> 02:26.420
till it has to change,

02:26.620 --> 02:30.940
because there is no sun coming that side,

02:31.140 --> 02:37.100
maybe there is no water levels arriving,

02:37.300 --> 02:40.060
so, they start changing.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.620
In the same way, one has to understand that,

02:42.820 --> 02:45.180
we are in the hands of the Divine,

02:45.380 --> 02:48.460
and if some plans are changed,

02:48.660 --> 02:54.700
it is reflecting back on us, and we have to see why.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.980
And the why of it is that we have to consolidate.

02:59.180 --> 03:04.540
Consolidation of Sahaja Yogis is very important.

03:05.580 --> 03:12.580
The first thing to consolidate yourself, you must do introspection.

03:12.780 --> 03:18.860
You must do introspection, is to reflect the light within

03:19.060 --> 03:22.540
and see for yourself:

03:22.780 --> 03:26.780
what have you done so far in Sahaja Yoga?

03:26.980 --> 03:30.220
Where were you, How far you have gone,

03:30.420 --> 03:33.940
and how far have you to go.

03:34.460 --> 03:38.940
What is the thing that is lacking in you?

03:40.540 --> 03:43.900
You’ll be surprised when you start seeing yourself,

03:44.100 --> 03:47.740
in a very unbiased manner, not justifying yourself

03:47.940 --> 03:49.780
not blaming any bhoots,

03:49.980 --> 03:56.420
or need not blame any badhas within you, or somebody else.

03:56.620 --> 04:00.140
If you start yourself [seeing] what has gone wrong with you

04:00.340 --> 04:04.700
that you could not consolidate yourself properly,

04:04.900 --> 04:08.260
you’ll be amazed that there has been problems

04:08.460 --> 04:12.340
still lingering on which must be corrected.

04:12.540 --> 04:16.380
Now these problems you can see very clearly.

04:16.580 --> 04:19.780
In the light of the Spirit you can see them very clearly

04:19.980 --> 04:25.220
that, “This has gone wrong with me.”

04:25.660 --> 04:29.460
One of the most interesting things I’ve noticed is that

04:29.660 --> 04:35.660
Sahaja Yoga is all the time covered with some sort of a maya.

04:35.860 --> 04:41.060
And this maya is ignorance, complete ignorance sometimes,

04:41.260 --> 04:43.660
sometimes partially.

04:43.860 --> 04:48.820
Now when you get into Sahaja Yoga you get blessed.

04:49.020 --> 04:53.260
You get blessed maybe,

04:53.780 --> 04:59.380
your family gets blessed, your children get blessed.

04:59.580 --> 05:04.100
You get some sort of a blessing for your physical being.

05:04.300 --> 05:10.220
Also for financial [side], you get jobs, you get money,

05:10.420 --> 05:16.420
you get something exceptional, which is really miraculous.

05:16.620 --> 05:22.460
Now people get very much lost in those achievements

05:22.660 --> 05:26.460
and start drifting, thinking that,

05:26.660 --> 05:29.100
“Oh, this is the blessing we have got now.

05:29.420 --> 05:31.260
We don’t have to do anything anymore,”

05:31.460 --> 05:33.540
that you are being rewarded sufficiently

05:33.740 --> 05:38.220
for whatever you have done so far. That’s not so!

05:38.420 --> 05:44.540
Is just a sort of a support to you comes

05:44.740 --> 05:50.140
so that your faith should be fully established in Sahaja Yoga.

05:50.460 --> 05:54.820
And specially, you should know Me, what I am.

05:55.540 --> 06:02.180
But, if you go on still drifting,

06:02.380 --> 06:08.020
then maybe some of these blessings may turn out to be curses,

06:08.220 --> 06:12.780
and you might feel that what a curse it has fallen upon us

06:12.980 --> 06:18.020
and how it has gone in the wrong way.

06:18.220 --> 06:21.940
For some people it takes time to feel,

06:22.140 --> 06:26.700
to get to the feel of the blessings.

06:26.900 --> 06:31.380
For example, mostly, according to the modern ideas,

06:31.580 --> 06:36.140
we think that to get more money is the biggest blessing.

06:36.340 --> 06:38.220
So, so many get that also.

06:38.420 --> 06:40.420
But actually, it is not.

06:40.620 --> 06:43.300
To get your peace within,

06:43.500 --> 06:45.740
to get to your witness state,

06:45.940 --> 06:48.620
and to feel your vibrations all right,

06:48.820 --> 06:51.620
and to be in the center, all the time ascending,

06:51.820 --> 06:53.620
is the real blessing.

06:53.820 --> 06:58.620
Because with that, you get everything else.

06:59.140 --> 07:01.020
The completion is only possible

07:01.220 --> 07:07.420
when you have the complete joy bubbling within yourself.

07:07.620 --> 07:15.140
After all, everything is just a means to achieve joy,

07:15.340 --> 07:18.500
to feel the joy.

07:18.700 --> 07:21.100
It is not the end.

07:21.300 --> 07:24.700
If it was, those people who have money,

07:24.900 --> 07:26.820
those people who have good health,

07:27.020 --> 07:31.300
those people who have all the success, so-called, with them,

07:31.500 --> 07:33.980
they should have had been happy and peaceful,

07:34.180 --> 07:37.380
but they are not, they are suffering,

07:37.580 --> 07:46.180
they are suffering too much, and they are, in a way,

07:46.380 --> 07:49.540
destroying themselves, day by day,

07:49.740 --> 07:52.900
because they hate their lives, they can’t bear it.

07:53.100 --> 07:56.580
They cannot understand why they are on this Earth.

07:56.780 --> 08:02.500
So all these blessings that come to you,

08:02.700 --> 08:05.340
all these changes that come to you,

08:05.540 --> 08:10.500
all these new venues that open to you,

08:10.700 --> 08:17.100
one has to know that it is for your benevolence,

08:17.300 --> 08:19.180
everything for your benevolence,

08:19.380 --> 08:22.340
and your benevolence is your ascent,

08:22.540 --> 08:25.380
nothing else but your ascent.

08:25.580 --> 08:32.380
The rest of it is all useless and fruitless.

08:33.940 --> 08:36.260
Once you understand that this is

08:36.460 --> 08:38.620
what you have to achieve in life,

08:38.820 --> 08:43.100
that is what you have to enjoy, then it works out.

08:43.300 --> 08:48.140
But in Sahaja Yoga as you see, it’s compassion and love.

08:48.340 --> 08:51.220
It is not so much restrictions.

08:51.420 --> 08:54.300
You are left to yourself to develop yourself.

08:54.500 --> 08:57.100
Is your Spirit which has to guide you.

08:57.300 --> 09:02.820
There’s no coaxing or correction going on all the time.

09:03.020 --> 09:08.860
But it is left to you to understand yourself,

09:09.060 --> 09:12.540
to see for yourself, and work it out.

09:12.740 --> 09:15.500
But one of the criteria should be

09:15.700 --> 09:20.380
that “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

09:20.580 --> 09:24.740
Now what have I done for Mother?”

09:24.940 --> 09:28.300
These two things are very important to understand.

09:28.500 --> 09:32.700
Whatever small thing I could do for Sahaja Yoga

09:32.900 --> 09:35.100
is important because

09:35.300 --> 09:37.940
if you are intelligent, you can see

09:38.140 --> 09:41.340
that this is the greatest thing you have to do

09:41.540 --> 09:44.820
is to work for God.

09:45.140 --> 09:49.660
This is the most important thing so far

09:49.860 --> 09:54.340
human beings have indulged into,

09:54.540 --> 09:59.100
is the highest type of enterprise

09:59.300 --> 10:06.980
that human beings have ever had a chance to indulge into

10:07.180 --> 10:10.060
and what a chance it is too!

10:10.260 --> 10:12.260
You may say that, “Mother we are mediocres,

10:12.460 --> 10:14.940
we are no good, we are useless,”

10:15.140 --> 10:18.460
but you are chosen.

10:18.980 --> 10:22.420
You are the one chosen so there must be something about you.

10:22.620 --> 10:25.740
You might not have seen that part within yourself

10:25.940 --> 10:32.100
which is going to work out this great work of God.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.180
So you have to locate and find out:

10:34.380 --> 10:37.100
“Why am I selected for Sahaja Yoga?

10:37.300 --> 10:40.100
What can I do in Sahaja Yoga?

10:40.300 --> 10:43.100
What can I work it out in Sahaja Yoga?”

10:43.300 --> 10:49.900
This should be a constant reminder to you that,

10:50.100 --> 10:52.340
“I have been chosen for Sahaja Yoga.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.380
I want to take full advantage of Sahaja Yoga.”

10:55.580 --> 10:57.620
Supposing somebody doesn’t have money,

10:57.820 --> 10:59.620
he expects that Sahaja Yoga should give money,

10:59.820 --> 11:02.620
must give jobs, must give this, must give that,

11:02.820 --> 11:05.940
must have children, must give good health,

11:06.140 --> 11:08.100
all that. Expectations are all right.

11:08.300 --> 11:13.060
But “What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?”

11:15.060 --> 11:18.620
This is another point of introspection.

11:18.820 --> 11:23.100
Very important to see that

11:23.300 --> 11:27.740
we have to do something for Sahaja Yoga.

11:27.940 --> 11:30.340
It’s not money, it’s not work,

11:30.540 --> 11:36.540
it’s not thinking, it’s not any kind of a support.

11:36.740 --> 11:39.820
But one of them, the most important thing is,

11:40.020 --> 11:44.140
how many people you have given Realization to?

11:46.620 --> 11:49.140
You have to count.

11:49.340 --> 11:53.780
How many people you have been able to give Realization to,

11:55.020 --> 11:59.100
how many people you have talked about Sahaja Yoga.

12:00.340 --> 12:03.940
You may think that you give Realization to some people,

12:04.140 --> 12:07.700
they come, they disappear – doesn’t matter.

12:07.900 --> 12:09.900
They will ultimately come to you.

12:10.100 --> 12:13.420
Today you try on some, they’ll be lost.

12:13.620 --> 12:18.740
Again tomorrow. You have to relentlessly work for it.

12:18.940 --> 12:21.540
As you know I’ve worked very hard in UK.

12:21.740 --> 12:26.100
My coming to UK itself was all predetermined.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.620
There was a need for Me to come here,

12:29.820 --> 12:33.780
to make the heart work better.

12:33.980 --> 12:37.500
But heart is lethargic, you know that,

12:37.700 --> 12:42.740
and lethargic heart gets all kinds of problems.

12:42.940 --> 12:46.220
But all these years I have been working,

12:46.420 --> 12:50.740
every year, whatever time I could give for Sahaja Yogis,

12:50.940 --> 12:53.380
for their problems, for Sahaja Yoga,

12:53.580 --> 12:56.540
for their minutest problem,

12:56.740 --> 12:58.740
for any kind of help they needed,

12:58.940 --> 13:02.300
every sort, I have tried to work it out.

13:02.620 --> 13:06.900
Directly, indirectly, you are all blessed.

13:07.100 --> 13:11.620
Still, what about you people who are now yogis?

13:11.820 --> 13:13.300
You are saints.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.060
You must see a photograph that I have,

13:15.260 --> 13:20.780
very interesting photograph, where you are all certified saints!

13:21.140 --> 13:22.900
Have you seen that photograph?

13:23.100 --> 13:27.020
Not yet? You better see it, let’s have it!

13:27.220 --> 13:30.820
The photograph is in My box, I think, yes.

13:31.020 --> 13:33.900
You are all certified saints!

13:34.100 --> 13:39.940
By the Divine, not by any cardinal or by any pope.

13:41.460 --> 13:44.020
So, what are all these saints doing?

13:44.220 --> 13:48.620
One saint which is certified by pope,

13:48.820 --> 13:51.220
who is artificially certified,

13:51.420 --> 13:53.740
is such a big thing, you know.

13:53.940 --> 13:57.620
What about you, who have been certified by God Almighty?

13:57.820 --> 14:00.420
You are still busy with your work,

14:00.620 --> 14:03.740
you are still busy with your little, little things,

14:03.940 --> 14:12.460
you are still busy with your small lives and small families.

14:12.740 --> 14:15.420
For a saint, it’s said in Sanskrit,

14:15.620 --> 14:18.740
“Udara charitanam vasudhaiva kutumbakam,”

14:18.940 --> 14:23.740
for a person who is of a generous nature,

14:23.940 --> 14:26.500
means a person who is a saint,

14:26.700 --> 14:30.500
the whole world is his own family.

14:30.820 --> 14:33.500
Are you still only worried about your own family?

14:33.700 --> 14:38.260
Then you are not yet aware of your saintliness.

14:38.460 --> 14:41.420
And a saint doesn’t only worry about his own wife,

14:41.620 --> 14:46.100
about his own child, about his own house,

14:46.300 --> 14:50.940
he worries about the whole world.

14:51.140 --> 14:55.540
Now, as Sahaja Yogis, you are powerful entities.

14:55.740 --> 14:58.940
You are very powerful people.

14:59.140 --> 15:03.620
We have got problems in the whole world. You know that very well.

15:03.820 --> 15:07.220
It’s not necessary you have to be great intellectuals,

15:07.420 --> 15:11.860
or you have to be people who are

15:12.060 --> 15:14.620
some sort of politicians, or something.

15:14.820 --> 15:18.940
But you must be on the lookout for the problems

15:19.140 --> 15:24.820
which are troubling this world. You have to be.

15:25.438 --> 15:28.480
You cannot live in your own world, that you are a saint,

15:28.680 --> 15:31.940
“Now I am in Niranand!” that’s not possible.

15:32.140 --> 15:34.340
You can’t just be in Niranand.

15:34.540 --> 15:39.260
You have to know that you have to live in this world,

15:39.460 --> 15:42.340
and you have to know all the problems of this world.

15:42.540 --> 15:44.020
And you have to think about them,

15:44.220 --> 15:46.820
not only your problems that, “Mother

15:47.020 --> 15:51.260
how will I be able to do this and how will I be able to do that?”

15:51.460 --> 15:54.020
But you have to worry about the whole world.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.020
You have to think, what’s happening in the world,

15:56.220 --> 15:58.340
what are the problems of the world.

15:58.540 --> 16:00.340
You are responsible for that.

16:00.540 --> 16:03.620
Not only that, but you have to pray.

16:03.820 --> 16:07.180
In your prayers you have to say, “Mother solve this problem.”

16:07.380 --> 16:11.340
Collectively, individually, you have to take your attention

16:11.540 --> 16:14.420
from yourself, from your smaller life,

16:14.620 --> 16:19.140
to a much wider thing – then you are a saint.

16:19.340 --> 16:27.100
And you have to think that it is your duty to ask for Divine help,

16:27.300 --> 16:31.100
that all these problems should be solved.

16:31.300 --> 16:35.740
This is your job for which you are selected.

16:35.940 --> 16:38.100
Your asking is going to work out

16:38.300 --> 16:40.380
because as you know, I am desire-less.

16:40.580 --> 16:45.700
You have to desire for it. Whatever you desire will work out.

16:45.900 --> 16:51.460
The protection, the affection, the compassion

16:51.660 --> 16:53.620
of Mother is with you.

16:53.820 --> 16:56.420
But you have to look after this world

16:56.620 --> 16:59.180
and show the concern that you have,

16:59.380 --> 17:02.420
not to live with a very limited areas,

17:02.620 --> 17:04.980
and with a very limited ways.

17:05.180 --> 17:09.020
Like now the British think, British are here, all right.

17:09.220 --> 17:12.060
“UK problems are our problems.” No.

17:12.260 --> 17:14.220
Your problems extend to

17:14.420 --> 17:17.420
all the places wherever there is Sahaja Yoga.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.500
And you have to worry about all of them.

17:19.700 --> 17:23.340
Now we are having, say, problems in Australia.

17:23.540 --> 17:26.180
And there’s somebody who is very troublesome.

17:26.380 --> 17:31.300
So, you have to see to it that

17:31.500 --> 17:35.900
you beat that person with shoes and put that right.

17:36.100 --> 17:39.700
Your leader has to tell whom to beat with the shoes.

17:39.900 --> 17:42.660
And work it out, whether it is in Australia,

17:42.860 --> 17:46.900
whether it is in America, whether it is in India,

17:47.100 --> 17:51.100
anywhere you see that there’s a problem on Sahaja Yoga,

17:51.300 --> 17:52.700
there’s an assault on Sahaja Yoga,

17:52.900 --> 17:56.820
all of you should put your attention to it and work it out.

17:57.020 --> 18:00.340
Then there are general problems as you see.

18:00.540 --> 18:04.900
You see, we see that America is now becoming idiotic,

18:05.100 --> 18:06.820
or whatever you may say,

18:07.020 --> 18:11.540
so you have to put your attention to America.

18:12.020 --> 18:15.420
You have to stretch your attention outside,

18:15.620 --> 18:16.980
not inside

18:17.180 --> 18:19.900
just worried about yourself, about your family,

18:20.100 --> 18:23.460
about your house, about your children.

18:23.660 --> 18:27.580
As soon as you spread your attention outside,

18:27.780 --> 18:31.420
your problems are solved in the house,

18:31.620 --> 18:34.820
in the smaller circle they are solved.

18:35.020 --> 18:36.980
You have to pay attention outside!

18:37.180 --> 18:39.020
Now these days there are televisions,

18:39.220 --> 18:41.900
where, first, we had said, “Don’t see any televisions!“,

18:42.100 --> 18:45.460
because there was no use seeing television by Sahaja Yogis.

18:45.660 --> 18:48.100
When they saw the television they only got caught up.

18:48.300 --> 18:51.620
But now there are important things that are happening

18:51.820 --> 18:54.660
which you can see for yourself. You can scan it out,

18:54.860 --> 18:57.660
what are the world problems, and you can see for yourself

18:57.860 --> 18:59.940
where you have to put your attention.

19:00.140 --> 19:03.580
You should become aware of your personality,

19:03.780 --> 19:08.180
it’s not a personality that can be

19:08.380 --> 19:13.340
completely involved into a very small area.

19:13.540 --> 19:16.180
Your personality, as such, should get involved

19:16.380 --> 19:21.020
into all the problems of the universe,

19:21.220 --> 19:23.260
all the problems there are.

19:23.460 --> 19:26.980
And you’ll be amazed that everything can work out

19:27.180 --> 19:28.420
in a very collective way.

19:28.620 --> 19:32.340
And at this stage, when you are, you can see for yourself now,

19:32.540 --> 19:36.420
all the Sahaja Yogis have got vibrations on top of their heads.

19:36.620 --> 19:38.980
Would you like to have a look, all of you?

19:39.180 --> 19:43.540
Just see! All of you, sitting in Ganapatipule.

19:44.900 --> 19:48.820
So stretch out your vibrations. Stretch out your attentions.

19:49.020 --> 19:51.180
And you’ll be amazed that

19:51.380 --> 19:56.580
all other stupid problems that you have will be finished.

19:56.780 --> 19:59.820
Now have a look. Let the children see first of all.

20:00.020 --> 20:05.220
Just see. You all have vibrations on top of your head.

20:18.935 --> 20:23.108
Please, pick-up the child who is crying, you see, just.

20:30.890 --> 20:37.461
What’s the matter? She’s tired, I think.

20:38.386 --> 20:42.014
Let’s sit down.

20:43.864 --> 20:49.263
Sit down, sit down, come along, sit down.

20:55.068 --> 21:00.328
Stand on. Hello, Stunia?

21:00.328 --> 21:03.954
Please put your face this side. Hello?

21:03.954 --> 21:06.443
Ah. Sit down.

21:07.209 --> 21:10.653
Now, sit down all of you, be sensible. Ah!

21:24.380 --> 21:30.460
Let them grow, I tell you, I’m just waiting for them to grow!

21:34.940 --> 21:41.420
So, the attitude toward ourselves should be

21:41.620 --> 21:46.620
to be aware of our own glory, of our own position,

21:46.820 --> 21:48.900
to know that we are saints,

21:49.100 --> 21:54.420
that we have reached a stage where we are at the highest,

21:54.620 --> 21:57.180
and that, now, we have become the light

21:57.380 --> 22:00.500
and we have to give light to others.

22:00.700 --> 22:04.580
If you see, in the Bible, Christ has said something,

22:04.780 --> 22:10.220
which is very important, that you
don’t put the light under the table.

22:12.500 --> 22:18.620
That’s what it is. You have to put the light on a pedestal.

22:18.820 --> 22:20.620
And that’s what it is that

22:20.820 --> 22:25.620
you have to put your light on the citadel,

22:25.820 --> 22:29.180
at a very highest point to give light to others.

22:29.380 --> 22:32.740
And this is working both ways

22:32.940 --> 22:35.660
if you start understanding what you are,

22:35.860 --> 22:40.020
what you have to be aware of, what is your situation,

22:40.220 --> 22:46.020
what is your powers, what you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga,

22:46.220 --> 22:54.020
what is the debt you have towards Sahaja Yoga,

22:54.220 --> 22:58.340
and what you have to give for Sahaja Yoga.

22:58.540 --> 23:01.580
How Sahaja Yoga has made you so capable,

23:01.780 --> 23:04.140
so good, so nice.

23:04.340 --> 23:07.620
Are you righteous enough? Are you behaving properly?

23:07.820 --> 23:10.500
Are you doing all the rightful things,

23:10.700 --> 23:13.300
which are necessary?

23:13.500 --> 23:17.420
Because it is only you who can do it.

23:17.620 --> 23:23.260
You are the people with a very very special energies

23:23.460 --> 23:29.100
and special contacts with the spiritual life,

23:29.300 --> 23:33.620
and if you start behaving like all other mundane, nonsensical people,

23:33.820 --> 23:35.900
limiting yourself to your family, your children,

23:36.100 --> 23:42.220
your nonsensical previous lives,

23:42.420 --> 23:44.700
you’ll be lost.

23:44.900 --> 23:48.020
Lost to yourself and lost to everyone.

23:48.220 --> 23:53.140
The problems are much more than what you know about.

23:53.340 --> 23:59.100
That is the understanding you have to reach,

23:59.300 --> 24:01.820
that Mother has made us yogis.

24:02.020 --> 24:03.700
We are saints.

24:03.900 --> 24:07.420
And we have to show to the world the right path.

24:07.620 --> 24:11.180
She has told us that we are the light

24:11.380 --> 24:15.180
and we have to show to people which way to go,

24:15.380 --> 24:16.740
how to go further.

24:16.940 --> 24:19.740
Instead of that everybody seems to be a problem,

24:19.940 --> 24:24.700
seems to be in a very small little whirlpool,

24:24.900 --> 24:26.980
going round and round and round.

24:27.180 --> 24:30.260
How can that be?

24:30.460 --> 24:32.980
I’ve told you many a times, look at these false gurus.

24:33.180 --> 24:35.340
They have no vibrations, they don’t know anything

24:35.540 --> 24:37.900
about Kundalini, nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

24:38.100 --> 24:42.100
But how much they are doing!

24:42.300 --> 24:44.580
While what are we doing?

24:44.780 --> 24:47.620
We’re struggling still with ourselves and with our problems,

24:47.820 --> 24:51.180
with our own ideas, with our very small-mindedness

24:51.380 --> 24:54.220
and chicken-heartedness.

24:54.820 --> 24:58.300
Now it is for you to understand.

24:58.500 --> 25:01.940
It is for you to decide about yourself.

25:02.140 --> 25:08.620
It is your own desire, it is your own bigness,

25:08.820 --> 25:12.020
your own magnanimity, which has to come forward.

25:12.220 --> 25:14.820
To see for yourself what you are capable of,

25:15.020 --> 25:16.420
what you can do.

25:16.620 --> 25:19.380
It’s very easy for people to say that,

25:19.580 --> 25:22.620
“Oh Mother, it’s too much. I can’t do anything about it.”

25:22.820 --> 25:26.220
Or somebody to say that, “Mother, I’m busy with my family.”

25:26.420 --> 25:29.500
Or somebody to say, “I’m busy with my children.”

25:29.740 --> 25:33.660
You have come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

25:33.860 --> 25:36.980
I have given you Realization for that?

25:37.180 --> 25:41.380
All these blessings have come to you for that?

25:41.780 --> 25:46.180
So the consolidation that you have to do is very important.

25:46.380 --> 25:48.100
You can see it clearly that’s why

25:48.300 --> 25:50.180
we could not have any public programs,

25:50.380 --> 25:55.100
because we really need consolidation in UK.

25:55.300 --> 25:57.220
Though I have lived in UK for so many years,

25:57.420 --> 26:01.300
people take me for granted here.

26:01.540 --> 26:03.740
Because I am here, because I am staying here,

26:03.940 --> 26:06.420
they think if we go to the airport, finished!

26:06.620 --> 26:09.340
We have done all the haj, everything.

26:09.540 --> 26:12.420
“We’ve been to the airport; we’ve seen Mother, finished!”

26:12.620 --> 26:14.420
What’s the use of seeing Me?

26:14.620 --> 26:16.980
What have I given you?

26:17.980 --> 26:20.060
Is your light spreading?

26:20.260 --> 26:22.780
How many people have got Realization from you?

26:22.980 --> 26:25.340
Just find out, how many people

26:25.540 --> 26:27.340
have learned Sahaja Yoga from you?

26:27.540 --> 26:30.100
Or from your lives, or from your wisdom,

26:30.300 --> 26:33.580
or from your behavior?

26:33.780 --> 26:36.740
That is the way, that is the criteria.

26:36.940 --> 26:37.900
It’s not that

26:38.100 --> 26:42.420
“All right, I have sent Mother her money for her travel.”

26:42.620 --> 26:43.820
That’s not sufficient.

26:44.020 --> 26:48.900
At my age, from India, if you see any lady at my age,

26:49.100 --> 26:53.460
she walks with a stick, she can’t climb even one step.

26:53.660 --> 26:57.700
Indian women can’t, because of the heat that they have- sort of.

26:57.900 --> 27:00.340
But I’m traveling, you know how I’m traveling,

27:00.540 --> 27:05.540
how much I am doing. What about my family?

27:05.740 --> 27:10.180
I deprive them of my company, I deprive my husband of my company,

27:10.380 --> 27:14.260
everybody is just without Me.

27:14.460 --> 27:16.980
I am traveling traveling every day,

27:17.180 --> 27:20.780
you know that very well, and I’m working so very hard.

27:20.980 --> 27:25.300
Sometimes I sleep at two o’clock, sometimes at three o’clock.

27:25.500 --> 27:28.100
This time Harsh was with Me,

27:28.300 --> 27:31.500
and I saw him, he was fagged out!

27:31.700 --> 27:35.700
So, I was saying you people do only relay race.

27:35.900 --> 27:39.540
I am in Australia, all right, Australians are working.

27:39.740 --> 27:41.980
Then I’m in Austria, then Austrians are working,

27:42.180 --> 27:46.060
then they are having a nice time there!

27:46.260 --> 27:49.660
I’m in UK, all right, little bit in UK, little work done.

27:49.860 --> 27:52.140
Then they all sit down nicely, enjoy.

27:52.340 --> 27:56.500
What about Me? I am having a marathon!

27:57.500 --> 27:59.500
In the same way you have to feel,

27:59.700 --> 28:03.500
after all, what is my gain in it?

28:03.700 --> 28:06.980
What do I gain out of it?

28:08.700 --> 28:11.060
I gain something:

28:11.260 --> 28:15.980
I have brought my children back to normal conditions,

28:16.180 --> 28:21.260
I have taken them to the Kingdom of God.

28:21.540 --> 28:23.820
You have to do the same.

28:24.020 --> 28:26.340
You have to take them to the Kingdom of God.

28:26.540 --> 28:30.100
But if you, yourself, are involved into your own mayas,

28:30.300 --> 28:33.420
you’ll be everyday going down and down and down and down.

28:33.620 --> 28:37.820
I may shout, I may say anything, it will not go into your heads,

28:38.020 --> 28:41.060
it will never click with you.

28:41.260 --> 28:43.500
You’ll be all stranded wherever you are,

28:43.700 --> 28:46.060
because you don’t want to see.

28:46.260 --> 28:49.340
For that I would say, you have one advantage,

28:49.540 --> 28:53.500
especially in UK. You are all very intelligent people.

28:53.700 --> 28:55.980
You have intelligence, no doubt,

28:56.180 --> 28:58.980
you are not idiots like Americans.

28:59.180 --> 29:00.860
You are intelligent.

29:01.060 --> 29:04.060
This intelligence became cunningness once upon a time,

29:04.260 --> 29:06.420
and now you are tired of your cunning.

29:06.620 --> 29:08.700
Indians have learned the cunning from you,

29:08.900 --> 29:11.660
they have become really very cunning.

29:11.860 --> 29:14.700
But you are tired of your cunningness,

29:14.900 --> 29:21.700
so now you are tired, fed up, fagged out, and lethargic.

29:22.420 --> 29:24.700
But with your intelligence you can understand

29:24.900 --> 29:28.060
that this is such an important work our Mother is doing.

29:28.260 --> 29:30.340
You’ll go down in the history!

29:30.540 --> 29:33.580
Every word you say, everything you say,

29:33.780 --> 29:35.100
every way you behave,

29:35.300 --> 29:38.060
everything is going to go down in the history!

29:38.260 --> 29:40.180
Not how many children you produced,

29:40.380 --> 29:42.900
or what sort of a wife you have,

29:43.100 --> 29:45.300
but what you did for Sahaja Yoga.

29:45.500 --> 29:46.780
Remember that.

29:46.980 --> 29:49.340
History is going to record everything,

29:49.540 --> 29:50.780
whatever you have done

29:50.980 --> 29:55.580
and whatever you have achieved in Sahaja Yoga.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.780
It’s not showing off.

29:59.980 --> 30:05.340
It’s not just a demonstration.

30:05.540 --> 30:07.100
It’s not talking big.

30:07.300 --> 30:09.780
It’s nothing of the kind.

30:09.980 --> 30:16.340
It’s actually, really, totally what you have achieved,

30:16.540 --> 30:20.180
is the point, will be recorded.

30:22.900 --> 30:26.980
At least God knows hypocrisy, and God knows bombastic temperaments.

30:27.180 --> 30:30.900
It’s God who knows where you are,

30:31.100 --> 30:32.780
and what you are up to.

30:32.980 --> 30:36.980
You cannot befool God, one thing you must realize.

30:37.180 --> 30:41.340
But when you are befooling God, you are befooling your Self,

30:41.540 --> 30:46.300
your Spirit, your Realization, your own ascent!

30:49.540 --> 30:52.300
So, we have to be careful.

30:52.500 --> 30:57.900
As a Mother, I would say try to be

30:58.100 --> 31:01.980
introspecting yourself very carefully:

31:02.180 --> 31:05.380
what have we done for Sahaja Yoga?

31:05.580 --> 31:10.980
What have we done for other people who are drifting?

31:11.180 --> 31:15.460
What has been our behavior towards other Sahaja Yogis?

31:15.660 --> 31:20.060
How much peace and love and compassion we have given to others?

31:20.260 --> 31:23.780
How much understanding and tolerance we have shown to others?

31:23.980 --> 31:26.580
If somebody gets here a little more money,

31:26.780 --> 31:30.100
he becomes so bombastic, he becomes so aggressive,

31:30.300 --> 31:32.340
he becomes so rude.

31:32.540 --> 31:34.420
I can’t believe it!

31:34.620 --> 31:40.220
How can money lure you into these vices?

31:41.020 --> 31:44.900
You are not ordinary people, you are the saints

31:45.100 --> 31:49.940
whose feet were washed by the River Ganges.

31:50.900 --> 31:55.340
Try to understand your glory. Try to understand your own powers,

31:55.540 --> 32:00.260
your own position as saintly people, Sahaja Yogis,

32:00.460 --> 32:02.060
which are above all the saints

32:02.260 --> 32:04.180
because you know how to give Realization,

32:04.380 --> 32:06.140
you know everything about Kundalini,

32:06.340 --> 32:09.380
you know everything about Realization.

32:09.580 --> 32:12.300
How many people knew about it?

32:14.780 --> 32:17.180
Otherwise, I’ll start thinking

32:17.380 --> 32:21.340
I have given all this knowledge to some bunch of fools

32:21.540 --> 32:24.860
who do not know what is the value.

32:25.060 --> 32:28.980
As Christ has said, “Don’t throw pearls before the swines.”

32:29.180 --> 32:31.420
But I don’t think I have done that mistake.

32:31.620 --> 32:33.420
I cannot believe I have done that mistake,

32:33.620 --> 32:35.700
that I have thrown pearls before swines.

32:35.900 --> 32:39.020
I have not done it.

32:39.300 --> 32:46.260
But, it is for you to decide where you stand, in what category.

32:46.900 --> 32:50.340
It is so obvious that

32:50.540 --> 32:55.540
it’s a very precarious time we are passing through.

32:55.740 --> 32:58.420
It’s very important, we have to fight it out.

32:58.620 --> 33:01.580
It’s much more than any wars you have fought.

33:01.780 --> 33:05.060
It’s much more than any struggle human beings ever had.

33:05.260 --> 33:10.700
It’s such a horrible world that is being created,

33:10.900 --> 33:13.060
and we have to transform it.

33:13.260 --> 33:15.180
It’s a tremendous task.

33:15.380 --> 33:18.180
For that you have to work out

33:18.380 --> 33:23.260
in a very sincere and a innate manner.

33:23.460 --> 33:27.060
And I’m sure one day will come

33:27.260 --> 33:32.300
that in the history of this world

33:32.540 --> 33:36.900
Sahaja Yogis will have their names written with golden letters.

33:37.100 --> 33:38.580
I am sure this will work out.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.980
I am sure this has to work out,

33:41.180 --> 33:45.580
and that you all have to achieve it,

33:45.780 --> 33:49.980
collectively, with one mind, with one heart.

33:50.180 --> 33:51.580
What should I sacrifice?

33:51.780 --> 33:53.100
What should I do?

33:53.300 --> 33:55.340
How should I help?

33:55.540 --> 33:58.780
What is my contribution?

33:58.980 --> 34:05.020
I wish I could see those days in my lifetime.
