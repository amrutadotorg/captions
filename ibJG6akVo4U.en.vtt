Shivaratri Puja, Pratisthan, India, 2003-0228

13:20.279 --> 13:28.999
Lord Shiva's biggest quality is forgiveness.

13:29.199 --> 13:36.752
If he doesn’t forgive, then nothing will be spared.

13:36.952 --> 13:39.840
He is very forgiving

13:40.041 --> 13:45.984
and because of his forgiving nature, we are surviving.

13:46.185 --> 13:49.665
otherwise we would have been finished.

13:49.865 --> 13:53.508
from such great god (Mahadev)

13:53.709 --> 14:02.376
we should ask him such qualities as forgiving nature

14:03.713 --> 14:13.351
like his character, like his powers. Despite such qualities he is full forgiveness,

14:13.552 --> 14:19.500
he takes into consideration that we are humans and he forgives.

14:19.700 --> 14:23.800
We should take his quality (guna) of forgiveness.

14:24.000 --> 14:29.303
We do not have such behaviour in which we forgive

14:29.503 --> 14:35.865
We cling to small petty things and fight.

14:36.065 --> 14:48.686
This is not Mahadev’s puja, those who follow him should forgive everyone.

14:48.886 --> 14:52.002
Anyone can commit mistake

14:52.947 --> 14:56.847
Everyone has some faults,

14:57.047 --> 15:00.410
Instead of looking at their faults you look at your own.

15:00.610 --> 15:03.879
and forgive the faults of others.

15:04.080 --> 15:07.394
This is very great quality of his to forgive

15:07.594 --> 15:14.580
and that quality in human race is very rare.

15:14.780 --> 15:18.244
There was time when there were many forgiving people

15:18.444 --> 15:29.591
but now don’t know how people consider anger as a big thing

15:29.844 --> 15:33.364
and they are not even ashamed of it.

15:33.564 --> 15:37.116
But if you are a worshiper of Mahadev(Shiva)

15:37.316 --> 15:47.114
and if you consider Shankar (Shiva) as your Guru

15:47.314 --> 15:56.831
then you have to be forgiving in nature like him.

15:57.031 --> 16:04.118
And despite such powers, if he wants he can destroy anyone.

16:04.318 --> 16:16.604
This is how his power of forgiveness (audio not clear)

16:21.572 --> 16:30.065
Many people worship Shivji to seek his forgiveness.

16:30.265 --> 16:33.611
“ Oh! God Forgive us”

16:33.811 --> 16:37.899
but he is all-forgiving in nature.

16:38.099 --> 16:44.667
And his forgiveness has magnanimity.

16:44.867 --> 16:50.308
Those who cannot forgive cannot be Sahaj yogis.

16:50.508 --> 16:54.520
The first proof of a Sahaj Yogi is that

16:54.720 --> 16:58.495
he is forgiving in nature from the heart.

16:58.695 --> 17:03.471
and he does not calculate what wrong has been done to him.

17:03.814 --> 17:07.345
Forgiveness is like ocean

17:07.545 --> 17:11.885
and to we have to settle in this forgiveness in ourselves.

17:12.085 --> 17:21.070
Then only Mahadev will be established inside us.

17:21.270 --> 17:30.695
But I still see that see that we get angry first instead of forgiving.

17:30.895 --> 17:32.828
forgiveness should come.

17:33.028 --> 17:36.086
and if you do not know how to forgive,

17:36.286 --> 17:39.688
then you wont be able to live in this world.

17:39.888 --> 17:44.591
You will live but you will be always angry with someone

17:44.791 --> 17:52.696
you will be always unhappy with others.

17:53.591 --> 17:56.028
Shivji always lives in bliss.

17:56.228 --> 18:07.732
But when he sees that someone is becoming like Rakshasa

18:07.932 --> 18:16.267
then even with the opening of his one eye that person is destroyed.

18:16.467 --> 18:18.211
That much power he has !

18:18.411 --> 18:23.278
and because he has so many powers that is why

18:23.478 --> 18:26.677
that is why he can forgive.

18:27.433 --> 18:31.929
So in all the powers he has

18:32.129 --> 18:40.723
their essence is that he uses them to forgive.

18:40.923 --> 18:48.055
Those who worship Shivji they have to measure for themselves

18:48.255 --> 18:54.523
that how much can we be forgiving ,how many can we forgive.

18:54.723 --> 19:00.036
In reality this is only the real criteria.

19:00.236 --> 19:03.585
But the anger which resides in us

19:03.785 --> 19:13.767
makes us feel that should correct this person or that person.

19:13.967 --> 19:16.118
This is not a right thing.

19:16.318 --> 19:18.830
Who are you to correct people?

19:19.030 --> 19:22.657
If Shivji is not even correcting them then who are you to do that!

19:22.857 --> 19:29.399
In this way, imagining anything about yourself is wrong.

19:29.599 --> 19:35.757
And by forgiving our heart becomes big

19:35.957 --> 19:41.406
and we can ascend to higher position.

19:41.606 --> 19:44.811
There are various things in life and amongst them

19:45.011 --> 19:51.899
I think that for a human to forgive is a big thing.

19:52.099 --> 19:55.089
Because that is very difficult for him.

19:55.289 --> 20:02.673
He gets angry on any issue and unhappy with anything.

20:02.873 --> 20:07.034
And there is no meaning in becoming unhappy

20:07.430 --> 20:12.327
there is no substance in it.

20:15.318 --> 20:21.838
Either you should have the power of Prem (love) through which

20:22.038 --> 20:28.571
you can understand others or the power of Anand (Happiness/Enjoyment)

20:29.472 --> 20:36.080
I find it difficult that humans are still on the same level

20:36.280 --> 20:43.366
despite realization,feeling vibrations and becoming stable in all aspects.

20:43.566 --> 20:47.706
but the capacity of forgiveness is very less.

20:48.048 --> 20:49.589
so this is wrong.

20:49.789 --> 20:55.471
Getting angry and upset on small things

20:55.671 --> 20:59.963
is not the feature of bhakta (worshiper) of Mahadev.

21:00.163 --> 21:08.663
and those who do his bhakti, their behaviour is full of Shanti (Calm)

21:08.863 --> 21:15.700
because they don’t get angry, such a person cannot remain upset.

21:15.900 --> 21:25.818
so such type of person has higher power of forgiveness.

21:26.018 --> 21:31.985
There are many things in which you should not get entangled.

21:32.185 --> 21:38.573
And you should try as much as possible to forgive (Kshama)

21:38.773 --> 21:44.352
This is the essence of Mahadev’s life.

21:44.552 --> 21:50.061
In our country, we had many great saints and

21:50.261 --> 22:02.892
here,in my opinion generally, we also had big incarnations (Avtarans).

22:03.092 --> 22:07.362
But today, the whole world believes in Shiv.

22:07.562 --> 22:12.118
It is because he can forgive.

22:12.318 --> 22:15.589
And this his special quality.

22:15.789 --> 22:20.952
The remaining other powers he has

22:21.152 --> 22:26.413
we can only achieve it if we learn to forgive.

22:26.613 --> 22:29.486
If we do not know how to forgive anyone then

22:29.686 --> 22:35.319
we can't even reach near his feet.

22:35.519 --> 22:40.202
In this world, mistakes always happen, after all it is human.

22:40.402 --> 22:44.550
But to trouble any human

22:44.750 --> 22:49.611
means distancing ourselves away from Mahadeva

22:49.811 --> 22:54.929
He has forgiven great Sins and Rakshasas

22:55.129 --> 23:00.713
From this he has learned what is love.

23:00.913 --> 23:12.009
And in love, a human should forgive.

23:12.209 --> 23:19.248
So the people who have forgiving nature, they do not develop anger.

23:19.448 --> 23:23.981
In any case they have to forgive,so why to develop anger.

23:24.181 --> 23:27.899
And it is reflected on their face.

23:28.099 --> 23:33.944
They are very simple and loving people.

23:34.144 --> 23:40.918
So we have to measure,how much can we forgive.

23:41.118 --> 23:45.600
And how many people can we forgive.

23:45.800 --> 23:50.394
You have the example of Isa Masi (Jesus Christ)

23:50.594 --> 23:53.139
When they were crucifying him, he said to the God

23:53.339 --> 23:57.401
"They don’t know what they are doing. So forgive them"

23:57.601 --> 24:00.813
He was saying it to Mahadev

24:01.013 --> 24:08.654
They were doing such a big sin, yet he asked for forgiving them.

24:08.854 --> 24:15.523
Based on our health, our heart,this quality (guna)

24:15.723 --> 24:19.465
of forgiveness manifests proportionally.

24:19.665 --> 24:23.578
But I see that as time is passing this quality is decreasing.

24:23.778 --> 24:32.250
Mostly……. Somebody is angry

24:32.450 --> 24:42.037
In this way, many people take to the wrong path and call it Dharma.

24:42.237 --> 24:45.775
Where there is no Shiv, there is no Dharma.

24:45.975 --> 24:52.234
That is why, today we have to promise that,

24:52.434 --> 25:00.029
if we have complications or anger against anyone we must forgive them.

25:00.229 --> 25:13.401
I do agree that, there are many sins from which we cannot be saved.

25:13.601 --> 25:22.695
But if you believe in Shivji, you will be surprised

25:22.895 --> 25:26.203
that you will not be touched by any sin,as your heart is so big

25:26.403 --> 25:32.232
because your heart is full of Shivji

25:32.432 --> 25:36.285
and it will realize it and act on it.

25:36.485 --> 25:44.736
So insulting anyone, underestimating others is wrong.

25:44.936 --> 25:49.083
Who are we to insult others?

25:49.283 --> 25:57.338
Humans due to ego do things like that, this is all the shadow of ego.

25:57.538 --> 26:05.751
And Shiv is such that, he has no ego at all.

26:05.951 --> 26:16.669
He has powers (shakti),despite being aware of them, he doesn’t gets angry.

26:16.869 --> 26:23.754
Because he is aware of his powers and that he can destroy anyone into ashes(Bhasm)

26:23.954 --> 26:33.938
That is why he maintains control, and is very much forgiving in nature.

26:34.146 --> 26:41.117
So we also have to decide today that we will not get angry on anyone,

26:41.309 --> 26:45.895
we will not look for shortcomings in others but ours.

26:46.095 --> 26:48.877
And getting angry on others it is a great sin

26:49.077 --> 26:52.686
because you are Sahaj Yogis.

26:52.886 --> 26:55.782
Hope now onwards you will become

26:55.982 --> 27:00.246
real followers (Bhaktas) of Shiv.Eternal Blessings.
