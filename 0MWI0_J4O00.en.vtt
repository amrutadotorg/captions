00:00:32.496 --> 00:00:36.660
﻿I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:51.226 --> 00:00:55.106
At the very outset we have to know

00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:58.805
that Truth is what it is.

00:01:07.623 --> 00:01:12.700
We cannot organize it, we cannot order it.

00:01:22.043 --> 00:01:27.460
And at the human level we cannot achieve it.

00:01:36.572 --> 00:01:39.864
We have become from ameba

00:01:40.065 --> 00:01:43.380
to this stage of the human beings.

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:57.300
But still we have not reached our absolute Truth.

00:02:05.106 --> 00:02:10.140
Some people believe
this is good, some people believe that is good.

00:02:16.359 --> 00:02:22.580
So under we can decide
something or on emotional basis

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.340
or on rational basis.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.820
And both are limited.

00:02:41.086 --> 00:02:44.860
Anything can be justified with rationality.

00:02:48.926 --> 00:02:52.420
Also emotionally we can justify;

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.820
might be our emotional oughts.

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:05.973
So everyone can think differently

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:10.180
according to their own projections.

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:25.340
So you have to go to a stage,

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.500
a state where you can all
say the same to this, is the Truth.

00:03:41.172 --> 00:03:44.613
The whole humanity has to come to that state

00:03:44.813 --> 00:03:47.972
where they know this is Absolute.

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:01.660
So we have to understand
that our evolution is not yet complete.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:12.700
There is one more break-through in it.

00:04:13.606 --> 00:04:15.606
One more break-through in it.

00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:27.980
This break-through is Self-Realization.

00:04:32.646 --> 00:04:35.300
Is to know your Self.

00:04:40.352 --> 00:04:44.940
To know your Self is not possible
if you work it out mentally,

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:47.700
physically, or emotionally.

00:04:59.713 --> 00:05:03.713
After all, when we became from ameba to this stage

00:05:03.913 --> 00:05:05.913
we did not do anything.

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:18.353
It is through the living process

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:24.100
of evolution we have
spontaneously become human beings.

00:05:35.313 --> 00:05:40.620
So, if anything has to happen
it has to happen spontaneously.

00:05:46.226 --> 00:05:51.700
Like a seed, if you put it in the
Mother Earth it sprouts by itself.

00:05:57.246 --> 00:06:00.580
So the seed has got a built-in quality

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:05.020
and the Mother Earth also has
contributive quality to sprout it.

00:06:21.273 --> 00:06:26.453
In the same way within us is placed the power

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.340
of pure desire,

00:06:29.666 --> 00:06:33.580
which gives you that break-through.

00:06:49.493 --> 00:06:52.760
It is the power of pure desire.

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.380
Whatever desires we have

00:06:59.993 --> 00:07:04.300
we do not get satisfied once they are fulfilled.

00:07:14.233 --> 00:07:18.260
We want to have food, when we
get the food we want to have clothes,

00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:22.820
when we have the clothes we want to 
have a house, then we want to have a car,

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:27.013
then we want to have an airplane, 
and I don’t know; it goes on like that.

00:07:44.712 --> 00:07:49.220
That means in general our wants are not satiable.

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:05.260
Then we have very dormant state,
we have a desire within us,

00:08:05.460 --> 00:08:07.590
which is a pure desire.

00:08:13.503 --> 00:08:15.700
This pure desire

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:20.620
is to become one with the
All Pervading Subtle Power

00:08:20.820 --> 00:08:23.050
of Love.

00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:40.140
Now whatever I’m telling you, you
have to accept it as a hypothesis.

00:08:45.846 --> 00:08:50.100
And as a scientist you must keep your minds open.

00:08:58.726 --> 00:09:04.180
And if it works then we have
to believe as honest people.

00:09:11.693 --> 00:09:17.780
So this power within us lies in
a triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:30.420
Sacrum is a Greek word meaning sacred,

00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.700
and it means, it means Greek people
knew that there is sacred power in it.

00:09:51.185 --> 00:09:56.060
So this power is placed in this triangular bone

00:09:56.390 --> 00:10:02.340
and is awakened as a germ

00:10:02.540 --> 00:10:07.020
or a primula in a seed, spontaneously.

00:10:20.936 --> 00:10:27.260
It pierces through six centers, ultimately
through the fontanel bone area

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:31.980
and you start feeling a cool
breeze coming out of your head.

00:10:46.442 --> 00:10:51.390
If this center is all right then
you start feeling in your hands

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:56.339
a kind of a beautiful soothing
cool breeze all around us.

00:11:05.293 --> 00:11:12.060
This power in the sacrum bone is
called as Kundalini in Sanskrit language.

00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:23.593
And many people in India thousands of years back

00:11:23.793 --> 00:11:28.860
have discovered about
this Kundalini in our country.

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:40.427
The word Kundalini comes from the coils,

00:11:40.627 --> 00:11:44.906
Kundalini is the coils because
it is in three and half coil.

00:11:53.940 --> 00:11:56.220
Now She is your mother.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:04.780
And She takes up all the troubles
to give you your second birth.

00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:14.620
So you don’t get any troubles.

00:12:19.059 --> 00:12:23.460
In Sanskrit language we call a person who

00:12:23.660 --> 00:12:29.660
knows about this All Pervading
Power of Brahma as, as dvijaha.

00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:49.780
Also a bird is called as dvidjaha.

00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:56.820
Dvi-jaha means born twice.

00:13:02.793 --> 00:13:06.460
Like a bird is first born at the egg

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.980
and then it becomes like a bird.

00:13:18.946 --> 00:13:25.100
In the same way a human being is born in a closed

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:32.860
way of ego and superego on his
brain, is the closed personality.

00:13:52.253 --> 00:13:57.980
But when Kundalini rises
and he becomes the Spirit,

00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:04.780
he becomes as different dynamic personality.

00:14:14.093 --> 00:14:17.300
He becomes that free personality.

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.540
No habits can overpower him.

00:14:29.293 --> 00:14:32.380
He does not overpower anyone.

00:14:34.426 --> 00:14:37.540
And nobody can overpower him.

00:14:40.706 --> 00:14:45.420
He becomes a very
compassionate, confident personality.

00:14:51.966 --> 00:14:57.446
And he can feel the All
Pervading Power on his fingertips.

00:15:04.466 --> 00:15:09.946
Now this All Pervading Power organizes,

00:15:10.333 --> 00:15:16.300
thinks, above all it loves.

00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:30.260
So, when this connection is established,

00:15:30.699 --> 00:15:36.740
your physical problems, your emotional
problems, your mental problems,

00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:40.460
and your spiritual problems all get solved.

00:15:51.906 --> 00:15:56.060
It is not an artificial thing, it’s reality.

00:16:01.626 --> 00:16:05.460
The problem with the religion was that

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.380
the essence of every religion was to seek

00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:18.860
the eternal and to treat the
transitory in its own limitations.

00:16:39.173 --> 00:16:42.260
But all the religions failed

00:16:43.066 --> 00:16:46.380
and they now are only mundane.

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.020
Either they have become power
orientated, money orientated,

00:16:59.220 --> 00:17:03.540
or emotional farces.

00:17:18.466 --> 00:17:22.300
So we have to seek this eternal power.

00:17:27.826 --> 00:17:31.860
And thus we become our Spirit.

00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:43.527
You can feel on your fingertips
what’s wrong with your centers

00:17:43.727 --> 00:17:46.940
and what’s wrong with the centre of others.

00:18:01.113 --> 00:18:05.700
So a small little drop, which is limited,

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:10.540
becomes one with the ocean and becomes the ocean.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:25.900
Then you become the instrument of that Power.

00:18:32.726 --> 00:18:35.940
That Power starts flowing through you.

00:18:40.319 --> 00:18:43.100
You become powerful.

00:18:45.206 --> 00:18:49.300
And you scientifically know what is this power

00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:52.300
of parasympathetic nervous system.

00:19:00.519 --> 00:19:05.340
You become a complete in control with yourself

00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:13.853
and in complete balance,

00:19:16.739 --> 00:19:21.900
very dynamic and compassionate at the same time.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:30.340
All the time this energy flows through you.

00:19:34.066 --> 00:19:36.820
So this is the power,

00:19:37.021 --> 00:19:40.220
which has got integrated [UNCLEAR within you]

00:19:41.679 --> 00:19:43.939
physical power,

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:48.060
the mental power, the emotional power,

00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.860
and the spiritual power of love.

00:20:04.906 --> 00:20:10.900
This is how the emancipation
of human beings is going to take place.

00:20:18.033 --> 00:20:22.260
This is how the
whole world is going to become one.

00:20:30.346 --> 00:20:33.860
Because your Spirit is the collective being.

00:20:39.259 --> 00:20:42.140
It’s not forced collectivity,

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.440
It's not forced collectivity,

00:20:49.133 --> 00:20:51.620
it is innate.

00:20:53.653 --> 00:20:59.580
For example, I would say, if I have all
the powers, I’m the greatest capitalist,

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:06.020
but I cannot live without sharing it with
others, so I’m the greatest communist.

00:21:20.653 --> 00:21:25.580
That’s how all these
theories become really actualized.

00:21:31.913 --> 00:21:34.393
The time has come today,

00:21:34.593 --> 00:21:36.980
this is the blossom time.

00:21:41.813 --> 00:21:45.620
So many flowers have to become the fruit.

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:56.167
Thus we are all here

00:21:56.367 --> 00:22:01.700
to get to that state where you all become Spirits.

00:22:10.346 --> 00:22:13.260
Which is the knowledge,

00:22:13.520 --> 00:22:18.020
which is the beauty, which is the goal.

00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:32.560
May you all be blessed.

00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:41.952
I would like you to ask
Me any questions if you have,

00:22:42.453 --> 00:22:49.260
because I’m here for the first time and
if you have any sensible questions please ask Me.

00:23:00.466 --> 00:23:05.100
I’m here to give you what
you have, your own property,

00:23:10.159 --> 00:23:12.780
not to take anything from you.

00:23:14.606 --> 00:23:18.260
So please ask Me questions, which are relevant.

00:23:22.019 --> 00:23:24.273
Thank you very much.

00:24:34.993 --> 00:24:38.513
Q: Is this Power like that 
of extrasensory individuals?

00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:43.873
Shri Mataji: ESP is a power
comes from dead spirits.

00:24:50.439 --> 00:24:57.393
And I told you that either you
can move to the left side or to the right side,

00:24:57.593 --> 00:25:04.060
you can move to the emotional side
or to the right side, also mental side.

00:25:21.206 --> 00:25:25.740
That is the sympathetic nervous system,
if you are doctors you can understand

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:30.200
that only the sympathetic nervous
system human beings can work.

00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.820
For example, if you are running

00:25:44.219 --> 00:25:49.100
you can increase the beat of your heart
through sympathetic nervous system.

00:25:57.053 --> 00:26:00.180
But in order to reduce the beat

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:05.060
that’s only possible through the
activity of the parasympathetic.

00:26:16.159 --> 00:26:22.380
So now when you get this power
you know exactly what it is.

00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:31.860
You know how it works.

00:26:36.067 --> 00:26:42.380
And those who work can give it to others also.

00:26:48.479 --> 00:26:52.713
ESP and all these things
can cause horrible diseases.

00:26:52.913 --> 00:26:59.378
I can tell you from My own experience,
it can cause a disease called epilepsy.

00:26:59.579 --> 00:27:05.153
There is a reception of prime
in India, by Sahaj Yogi has done it,

00:27:05.354 --> 00:27:08.607
he’s a doctor, he’s got his MD with epilepsy.

00:27:08.807 --> 00:27:12.020
That’s one of the things
you get – epilepsy with ESP.

00:27:20.073 --> 00:27:24.380
You get into the power
of somebody else; it’s not your power.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:34.260
Also cancer and many incurable psychosomatic

00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:38.060
troubles can come from this kind of reach.

00:27:44.866 --> 00:27:48.800
While you can cure many people

00:27:49.726 --> 00:27:53.580
by raising the Kundalini, you
can see with your naked eyes

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.980
the movement of a Kundalini in some people.

00:28:11.733 --> 00:28:15.420
And in some people you can see the throbbing

00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:18.747
here reaching on your head.

00:28:18.947 --> 00:28:23.380
And when the throbbing stops you feel
the cool breeze coming out of your own head

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:27.700
and then you see, feel the cool breeze around you.

00:28:45.618 --> 00:28:49.459
This is the power of love, of pure love.

00:28:54.946 --> 00:29:00.940
We have never used the power of love; we have
only used the power of hatred all over the world.

00:29:14.453 --> 00:29:17.660
Tomorrow I’ll explain more as to

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:22.733
how people can go on the
left side or to the right side.

00:30:43.599 --> 00:30:48.213
Q: Self-Realization can be harmful for children?
(Misheard as; Self-Realization can become for children?)

00:30:48.414 --> 00:30:52.744
Shri Mataji: Of course, they
are the best, they are the fairest.

00:31:25.853 --> 00:31:31.860
Q: Really, could it be possible that all
the people who are sitting here in our room

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:36.420
would be able to feel this Realization,

00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:39.586
maybe it is not for the first time
but for the second, third, fourth?

00:31:39.787 --> 00:31:43.580
Shri Mataji: Now, maybe first time most of you.

00:31:48.246 --> 00:31:50.660
Have faith in yourself.

00:31:51.713 --> 00:31:57.606
Just say, have faith in yourself.
Tell them have faith in yourself.

00:32:30.779 --> 00:32:40.379
(Question simplified): I have felt coolness coming out from my palms right now, like wind, and my breathing became more frequent. Could this be possible?

00:32:40.613 --> 00:32:44.740
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, why not?
That means you are very receptive.

00:32:45.753 --> 00:32:47.799
Good, good.

00:33:19.800 --> 00:33:24.700
Q: Is the Self Realization 
for the awakening of Kundalini

00:33:24.900 --> 00:33:29.733
the only way to [get] the Realization?

00:33:29.993 --> 00:33:32.980
Shri Mataji: That’s only way.
Because it’s a living process.

00:33:33.180 --> 00:33:38.140
Like a seed has to sprout to become
the tree, there’s no other way out.

00:33:50.132 --> 00:33:52.132
It’s natural.

00:34:42.667 --> 00:34:54.626
(Question simplified): Did Indira Gandhi and Nickolas Roerich possess that power?

00:34:54.833 --> 00:34:59.300
Shri Mataji: No, but don’t ask the
personal questions. This was not,

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:05.860
but to Mahatma Gandhi it was, to
Lenin it was, and to Maxim Gorky it was.

00:35:15.926 --> 00:35:18.820
To Gorbachev it is.

00:35:25.733 --> 00:35:31.420
I don’t asked it, you see, because I’ll
have to tell you the truth, you see,

00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.560
and some people will not like it.

00:35:42.146 --> 00:35:47.100
Of course, you will know about that,

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:52.727
and you’ll know all about them – Lord
Krishna, and also Rama, everybody

00:35:52.927 --> 00:35:56.460
and all these things you will
know, everything about Them,

00:35:56.660 --> 00:36:02.580
once you come to Sahaja Yoga, every
knowledge. There will be no secret.

00:36:55.867 --> 00:37:00.840
Q: I couldn't understand [what is]
Kundalini – is it a Spirit or an energy?

00:37:01.107 --> 00:37:03.413
Shri Mataji: It’s an energy.

00:37:04.526 --> 00:37:07.147
Spirit is in the heart.

00:37:09.793 --> 00:37:12.660
And the seat of the Spirit is here.

00:37:21.559 --> 00:37:26.060
I’ve told you there’s
the integration of four energies within us.

00:37:26.999 --> 00:37:30.900
Tell them there are four energies,
in addition of four energies.

00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:33.300
One that comforts,

00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.420
one that counsels, one that redeems.

00:37:55.412 --> 00:38:01.900
And also the fourth one is that it gives you the
new dimension on your central nervous system,

00:38:02.999 --> 00:38:05.139
collective consciousness.

00:38:25.787 --> 00:38:28.780
If you have personal problems

00:38:28.980 --> 00:38:34.620
tomorrow I will be here again
and I’ll meet all of you, personally.

00:38:59.287 --> 00:39:02.013
Interpreter: Today, they ask today.
Shri Mataji: No tomorrow,

00:39:02.213 --> 00:39:07.100
tomorrow, because today we have
got some dancers, I want to see their dancing.

00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:19.340
I will greet this every day,
now let’s see [UNCLEAR] the dance.

00:39:29.100 --> 00:39:31.953
All right? Thank you. Spasibo.

00:39:42.807 --> 00:39:48.340
Now, Chernobyl has been a great, great problem.

00:39:48.540 --> 00:39:51.900
All My attention was there.

00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:57.180
And it was a lesson to us

00:39:57.866 --> 00:40:02.153
that we should not indulge
too much with atomic energy.

00:40:22.213 --> 00:40:25.660
We should now care more for peace.

00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:35.407
And the All Pervading Power

00:40:35.607 --> 00:40:38.460
will give us everything that you want.

00:40:44.593 --> 00:40:48.620
And we should not play
with such terrible energies,

00:40:48.820 --> 00:40:51.580
which can be very dangerous.

00:41:01.353 --> 00:41:06.860
I feel sorry that Ukraine
people have been suffered,

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.020
but this a lesson for the whole world.

00:41:17.353 --> 00:41:23.060
Moreover, it’s like they were the ones
who are crucified for the whole world.

00:41:23.261 --> 00:41:26.620
I’m sorry for that, very much sorry.

00:41:35.893 --> 00:41:38.633
But the Spirit does not die.

00:41:38.833 --> 00:41:44.706
For the people have died, their Spirits
are still there and they may come once again.

00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:55.153
Q: Respected Mistress, there
are many Yogas in India –

00:41:55.353 --> 00:42:01.106
Hatha Yoga, Raja Yoga, Karma Yoga,
etc. What is the peculiarity of Sahaja Yoga?

00:42:01.853 --> 00:42:09.380
Shri Mataji: In a… all kinds of
Yoga's they have got this talk about.

00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:14.860
Now if you, if these people
read the Patanjali Yoga,

00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.260
which is Patanjali who has
written it, they set a big book.

00:42:30.413 --> 00:42:35.573
In that this asanas and
all that is not even this much.

00:42:43.853 --> 00:42:47.700
Sahaja Yoga is described
in this book very clearly,

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:51.780
that you have to reach the
state of thoughtless awareness

00:42:51.980 --> 00:42:54.980
and then undoubted awareness.

00:43:08.293 --> 00:43:14.740
And he had also called this All Pervading
Power as [UNCLEAR Rutambhara Pragia].

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:25.107
But some of that people who
went to Himalayas and all that

00:43:25.308 --> 00:43:30.641
and they were useless, so they just
knew little bit about this Yoga asanas.

00:43:42.613 --> 00:43:46.013
And those who were teachers threw them away

00:43:46.214 --> 00:43:49.701
so they started teaching asanas.

00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:02.367
Leading the attention of
people only to the physical side.

00:44:07.465 --> 00:44:11.119
But even physically it’s very dangerous to this,

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.847
to do this asanas without explanation.

00:44:23.926 --> 00:44:29.760
It is like taking all the medicines
from a medicine box without knowing.

00:44:37.940 --> 00:44:44.446
In Sahaja Yoga also if somebody has some
physical problem on the spinal cord we use there,

00:44:44.647 --> 00:44:50.287
the one that’s required
any asan. If it’s necessary.

00:45:01.259 --> 00:45:06.979
But Sahaja Yogis are masters,
they know what to be used.

00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:12.800
It’s not absurd that’s you go on
turning that body into [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:30.932 --> 00:45:35.606
The other day I met a very
important minister, counselor-minister.

00:45:35.807 --> 00:45:40.160
Poor man, he was complaining
to Me that he did Hatha Yoga.

00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:44.000
Now the situation is such that all
his muscles have become tense

00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:47.593
and one of this shoulder joints, the socket,

00:45:47.794 --> 00:45:51.394
from the socket the bones
come out and they have to again...

00:46:11.173 --> 00:46:16.200
Because he said that his guru, his teacher,
make wanted to make him an expert

00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:20.432
and made him first to stand on
his head and all these [UNCLEAR].

00:46:20.633 --> 00:46:24.400
[INAUDIBLE] gets a 
horrible self-destructive things.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.279
In the beginning he said, “I felt better,

00:46:42.480 --> 00:46:46.040
but now at this age of mine 
I’ve become a very weak person,

00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.000
and so many of us who had learnt
this man have become very weak.”

00:47:04.826 --> 00:47:08.400
And I found they have a very weak heart also.

00:47:12.573 --> 00:47:16.280
In Sahaja Yoga you will know why it happens.

00:47:20.906 --> 00:47:24.453
Because he developed a very one-sided personality.

00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:33.120
Actually, Ha-Tha, Ha means
the Sun, Tha means the Moon.

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:37.040
Ha-Tha Yoga, means that both the naris to be used.

00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:40.160
But they only use the right nari.

00:47:55.666 --> 00:48:01.380
They just use that Sun nari
by that they become very dry,

00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:05.440
absolutely dry, because they get liver problems

00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:08.560
and very hot temper, the really hot temper.

00:48:26.592 --> 00:48:29.666
They are so aggressive that to go near them

00:48:29.867 --> 00:48:34.413
you have to use a barge pole 
in between. Barge Pole in between.

00:48:41.286 --> 00:48:44.720
They divorce very easily, they
can not carry on with their wives.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:48.600
It’s very funny, even the wives 
become like men; it’s horrible.

00:48:56.693 --> 00:48:59.453
Now the other word is Raja Yoga.

00:49:02.800 --> 00:49:07.217
Raja Yoga has come from the
idea that when the Kundalini rises

00:49:07.418 --> 00:49:11.445
there are lots of things happen,
like when She rises there’s upon Nabhi,

00:49:11.646 --> 00:49:16.013
there’s a constriction in the chakras,

00:49:16.214 --> 00:49:19.720
till doesn’t fall down or when
it comes to here (Vishuddhi)

00:49:19.920 --> 00:49:24.280
they call it that we have to
the tongue is fallen inside.

00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:27.280
It’s a fact, little bit 
happens, little bit happens.

00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:30.200
But you don’t have to worry.

00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.453
Tell them that.

00:49:57.661 --> 00:50:01.628
Now it happens that it’s like you see

00:50:01.829 --> 00:50:06.242
supposing if your car is
ignited, started, your car started,

00:50:06.443 --> 00:50:08.897
then all the machine starts working by itself.

00:50:09.098 --> 00:50:14.791
But supposing you take out the wheel
and start moving it without igniting that thing,

00:50:14.992 --> 00:50:19.352
like without rising the Kundalini
if you start moving your charkas,

00:50:19.553 --> 00:50:22.939
this, that, what will happen? It will be spoiled.

00:50:24.072 --> 00:50:26.072
Artificially.

00:50:57.933 --> 00:51:03.340
Unless and until you start your car
what’s the use of moving the wheel or [INAUDIBLE].

00:51:21.778 --> 00:51:27.460
And to such an extend, to such an extend
that they cut that thread under the tongue,

00:51:27.660 --> 00:51:31.060
and the tongues are hanging just like the dog’s tongues.

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:34.933
You see, they can’t talk. I know
some doctors from India was doing it,

00:51:35.133 --> 00:51:41.060
because they say you have to down your tongue inside just for the [INAUDIBLE], horrible.

00:52:07.132 --> 00:52:12.620
This I saw in California, so the first
idea that you have to suffer to enter

00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:18.180
into this great Kingdom
of love is absolutely wrong.

00:53:06.200 --> 00:53:13.940
Q: Could be natural powers,
like water, like earth, like air

00:53:14.547 --> 00:53:17.860
help to raise Kundalini?

00:53:18.547 --> 00:53:22.293
Shri Mataji: Yes, they do. We‘ll take their help.

00:53:24.752 --> 00:53:29.180
But first of all there should
be somebody who knows the job.

00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:53.140
Q: What could be a main
problem in raise Kundalini?

00:53:53.340 --> 00:53:57.806
Could it be a collective
problem or individual problem?

00:53:58.293 --> 00:54:02.720
Shri Mataji: There could be any, but
you don’t worry about it, you forget it.

00:54:15.013 --> 00:54:21.060
That’s My headache, that’s My
headache, I’ll find out, you don’t worry.

00:54:27.173 --> 00:54:29.767
These were collective, collective vision,

00:54:29.967 --> 00:54:34.513
but we have hundred, hundred
things, one need not bother it.

00:54:38.733 --> 00:54:42.106
Q: The power of practical Realization? They want Realization.

00:54:42.307 --> 00:54:46.300
Shri Mataji: Practice! Practice! He is a seeker!

00:54:48.126 --> 00:54:50.819
After, after I will do it, I will, I will.

00:55:02.939 --> 00:55:07.931
Q: When this power has come out,
what should we do with it, please?

00:55:12.333 --> 00:55:17.580
Shri Mataji: We’ll tell you everything,
we’ll tell you how to use it.

00:55:23.752 --> 00:55:26.013
That’s all is free.

00:55:40.305 --> 00:55:42.985
Q: Where [does the] Kundalini go when we [INAUDIBLE]?

00:55:43.186 --> 00:55:45.180
Shri Mataji: Now he’s asking about death.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.653
We need not talk about death, 
nobody’s going to die here now.

00:55:53.700 --> 00:55:56.220
You will know everything about it, later on.

00:55:58.739 --> 00:56:02.220
And we will answer it, you’ll see.

00:56:04.153 --> 00:56:10.233
See now, we have beautiful life we did
saw, and not sought to beautiful life.

00:56:10.434 --> 00:56:15.286
Now, when you come in the room

00:56:15.813 --> 00:56:20.300
you ask what switch you have to put

00:56:21.007 --> 00:56:24.940
and you put on one switch
and all the lights come in.

00:56:43.537 --> 00:56:47.340
Because it’s all built in, it is all built in.

00:56:51.206 --> 00:56:57.060
Now, if I have to tell you the history
of electricity, the source of electricity,

00:56:57.260 --> 00:57:02.060
a name of the engineer who
did it, you, say, will be bored.

00:57:18.465 --> 00:57:24.093
So the first thing is to get the light and
then know about it, it’s much better, isn’t it?

00:57:47.468 --> 00:57:51.700
Now, we have lots of literature.

00:57:52.493 --> 00:57:56.660
But, you see, reading it is not going to help you.

00:58:10.673 --> 00:58:15.473
Reading too much can be also
headache, I tell you, one of [INAUDIBLE].

00:58:24.253 --> 00:58:26.900
There’s a very great saint in India, Paritta,

00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.866
he said that by reading
too much people have become stupid.

00:58:41.753 --> 00:58:45.100
So I could not understand, how can that be?

00:58:45.893 --> 00:58:50.460
I did not understand, how can that be.
But I’ve seen that people are over read,

00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:55.860
they will go on asking
questions from the poor man, just wasting times.

00:59:14.126 --> 00:59:17.126
Second question this lady has.

00:59:22.579 --> 00:59:29.440
Q: Is high radiation affecting
our energetic ability in our body?

00:59:41.053 --> 00:59:43.660
Shri Mataji: Once you are Realized soul,

00:59:44.453 --> 00:59:49.140
if there are many Realized souls in
your place no accidents can take place.

00:59:59.853 --> 01:00:01.853
God protects.

01:00:04.793 --> 01:00:06.860
You are protected

01:00:07.592 --> 01:00:11.020
and also all radiation,

01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:16.780
all evil forces are killed and neutralized.

01:00:29.666 --> 01:00:34.740
And like the Statue that
you have here, of The Mother,

01:00:34.940 --> 01:00:38.093
She makes a Kundalini who protects you

01:00:38.293 --> 01:00:42.020
and also She kills all that is negative.

01:00:54.313 --> 01:00:57.493
Also She challenges the church.

01:01:02.633 --> 01:01:06.860
Imagine, the churches, I don’t
know, what your church is,

01:01:07.060 --> 01:01:11.500
but Roman Catholic Church doesn’t ordain a woman,

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.793
as a priest.

01:01:24.493 --> 01:01:28.940
And the Kundalini is the Primordial Mother.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:41.340
Can you imagine, they have got God the Father,

01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:45.620
God the Son and no Mother.

01:01:55.345 --> 01:01:57.379
How can you say that?

01:01:57.580 --> 01:02:01.740
And to Indian a woman is Goddess,

01:02:01.940 --> 01:02:04.340
Goddess is a woman.

01:02:13.726 --> 01:02:17.960
So is very different that you put down

01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:22.020
50-60% people as something lower.

01:02:35.012 --> 01:02:38.020
In Sahaja Yoga if you are a woman or a man,

01:02:38.220 --> 01:02:43.020
whatever you are, you can all become
masters, you can all become yogis.

01:02:43.220 --> 01:02:49.140
So Me, there is no such differentiation
for men or women, it’s nonsense.

01:03:16.685 --> 01:03:21.406
Interpreter: Questions about Jesus
Christ; what kind of powers Jesus Christ had?

01:03:21.607 --> 01:03:26.220
Shri Mataji: Ah, you will know about
Jesus Christ also, everything about Him.

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:31.740
Who He was,

01:03:33.466 --> 01:03:35.740
what were His powers,

01:03:37.266 --> 01:03:39.273
everything.

01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:43.180
About all of those Divine Incarnations,

01:03:46.133 --> 01:03:48.500
you will know all about Them.

01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:52.220
But it won’t be just a sermon,

01:03:52.421 --> 01:03:55.260
actually on your fingertips you will know.

01:04:01.999 --> 01:04:05.260
You’ll know on the Kundalini itself

01:04:05.906 --> 01:04:09.100
when it moves you will know Their importance.

01:04:18.433 --> 01:04:22.680
Do not judge Them by the
way people start these religions,

01:04:22.881 --> 01:04:25.413
they are all [UNCLEAR] side.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:42.453
Q: What is the purpose of
the candle that is near You?

01:04:44.426 --> 01:04:47.740
Shri Mataji: I don’t know why that
is put, this could work other side,

01:04:47.940 --> 01:04:54.300
but candle is good, if there’s any negative
force here that can show on the candle also.

01:05:09.506 --> 01:05:12.506
It drives out all [UNCLEAR].

01:05:16.613 --> 01:05:21.720
Q: When was born the first Self-Realized person?

01:05:26.858 --> 01:05:28.858
Shri Mataji: In Sahaja Yoga?

01:05:29.059 --> 01:05:30.893
Interpreter: No, no, no. Just?

01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:35.733
Shri Mataji: In the World?
Interpreter: Yes. In the world like...

01:05:47.286 --> 01:05:49.800
Eight thousand years back

01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:55.980
we have the father-in-low of Rama, Raja Janaka,

01:06:04.906 --> 01:06:09.380
who was the incarnation of Brahmadeva Master.

01:06:16.526 --> 01:06:23.900
And a disciple called Nachiketa went
to him to ask for Self-Realization.

01:06:24.100 --> 01:06:27.140
One, one, Nachiketa.

01:06:33.633 --> 01:06:39.100
And He told him that, “You can ask for
anything, but not ask for Self-Realization”.

01:06:48.286 --> 01:06:51.460
And He tested him, and tested him, and tested him.

01:06:55.859 --> 01:07:02.300
So it is difficult to give the history about
the Realized soul, but it’s an eternal process.

01:07:13.733 --> 01:07:19.260
On the Tree of life first there were only
one or two flowers to become fruits.

01:07:19.666 --> 01:07:22.520
But today it’s a blossom time.

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.588
All right now, should we have our Realization?

01:07:55.746 --> 01:07:59.820
So there are two conditions,

01:08:01.319 --> 01:08:03.340
two conditions.

01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:11.060
One is to

01:08:12.053 --> 01:08:17.206
forgive yourself and forget the past.

01:08:31.426 --> 01:08:34.380
Not to feel guilty at all.

01:08:38.373 --> 01:08:41.900
After all, you are human beings

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.660
and only human beings can make mistakes,

01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:48.580
so what is there to feel so guilty?

01:08:56.953 --> 01:09:02.740
And the All Pervading Power
is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:09:08.739 --> 01:09:12.700
So what mistake can you commit

01:09:12.900 --> 01:09:15.799
that can not be dissolved in that ocean?

01:09:24.853 --> 01:09:31.820
The second condition is that
please forgive everyone whatsoever.

01:09:41.466 --> 01:09:45.180
You may say that is difficult to forgive.

01:09:48.139 --> 01:09:53.820
But whether is it forgiven or you don’t
forgive logically you don’t do anything.

01:10:02.166 --> 01:10:05.980
But if you don’t forgive then you
are playing into wrong hands.

01:10:10.633 --> 01:10:15.200
So the best thing is to forgive
everyone from your heart, forgive.

01:10:21.206 --> 01:10:23.206
Prostite.

01:10:26.026 --> 01:10:32.820
Thirdly, we have to know we
are going to enter in the beauty of love.

01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.060
Into the kingdom of enjoyment, joy.

01:10:48.913 --> 01:10:52.660
Into the garden of purity and bliss.

01:10:58.752 --> 01:11:03.460
And we are going to know how we are glorious.

01:11:09.199 --> 01:11:13.780
So we have to be very
pleasantly placed towards ourselves.

01:11:20.711 --> 01:11:24.400
Not to be angry with yourself, maybe

01:11:24.613 --> 01:11:28.420
you might have done anything before, forget it.

01:11:36.305 --> 01:11:40.260
In your seeking you might have 
done anything, doesn’t matter.

01:11:48.618 --> 01:11:52.620
Don’t judge yourself, your 
Kundalini will itself judge you.

01:11:58.405 --> 01:12:02.580
And have
complete faith in yourself and confidence.

01:12:10.366 --> 01:12:13.860
Already some people have 
filled a cool breeze in the hands.

01:12:21.206 --> 01:12:24.293
All right, the second of these things that

01:12:24.493 --> 01:12:28.606
we have to take out our shoes 
to take the help of the Mother Earth.

01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:05.600
All right.

01:13:13.146 --> 01:13:16.980
You have to sit in a relaxed manner,

01:13:17.419 --> 01:13:22.620
not which allows you like that 
or not too much straight like that.

01:13:22.821 --> 01:13:24.821
Relax straight.

01:13:42.712 --> 01:13:44.712
Now,

01:13:44.913 --> 01:13:49.820
first I’ll show you how we 
are going to use our left hand

01:13:50.020 --> 01:13:55.180
symbolically to suggest that 
we want Self-Realization,

01:13:55.380 --> 01:14:01.060
because left hand or the 
left side is the power of desire.

01:14:14.886 --> 01:14:21.460
And the right hand to give energy to our chakras

01:14:22.780 --> 01:14:26.060
in a way that the Kundalini rises.

01:14:35.185 --> 01:14:39.140
It is spontaneous but by this 
you will know later on also

01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:42.820
whenever you want to 
raise your Kundalini afterwards.

01:14:57.518 --> 01:15:00.020
Now please put your…

01:15:01.712 --> 01:15:03.980
I’ll tell you everything, all right.

01:15:38.731 --> 01:15:41.420
He will show you, he will show you.

01:15:49.403 --> 01:15:52.020
You cannot see Me?

01:15:55.819 --> 01:16:00.820
Now, please put your left hand 
towards Me like this on your lap.

01:16:10.879 --> 01:16:13.660
And right hand on your heart.

01:16:17.427 --> 01:16:20.820
And in the heart resides the Spirit.

01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:29.633
Now you have to take your hand like that,

01:16:29.833 --> 01:16:32.580
you are working only on the left hand side.

01:16:36.513 --> 01:16:41.340
And this hand is steady and the 
right hand then moves from this

01:16:41.540 --> 01:16:45.060
to the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:16:54.239 --> 01:16:58.860
So this is the center of your mastery,

01:16:59.060 --> 01:17:04.980
so that you know how to control yourself.

01:17:11.393 --> 01:17:15.820
Then you have to put your 
hand on the lower portion

01:17:16.020 --> 01:17:18.660
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

01:17:25.973 --> 01:17:29.580
Now this is the center of the pure knowledge,

01:17:33.333 --> 01:17:35.333
pure knowledge,

01:17:37.733 --> 01:17:41.580
knowledge of all the laws

01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:45.420
of this Power.

01:17:51.012 --> 01:17:54.940
Now, then you have to put again your
hand in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:17:55.140 --> 01:17:57.300
on the left hand side.

01:18:04.112 --> 01:18:07.500
Now on your heart again.

01:18:11.480 --> 01:18:16.853
Now you have to take your right hand
in the corner of your neck and your head

01:18:17.053 --> 01:18:19.620
and turn your head to your right.

01:18:28.945 --> 01:18:32.380
This center catches when you feel guilty.

01:18:36.053 --> 01:18:40.460
And gives you a horrible 
diseases like spondylitis and angina.

01:18:47.086 --> 01:18:52.740
Now you have to place your right hand
on top of your forehead across, like this.

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:00.900
You have to bend your head

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:04.980
as much as you can.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:12.860
Now this hand has to go on the 
back side and push back your head.

01:19:17.919 --> 01:19:20.980
This is the center of forgiveness.

01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:26.100
Now you have to stretch your hand.

01:19:29.759 --> 01:19:33.580
And put the center of your palm

01:19:34.019 --> 01:19:38.860
on top of the soft bone that you had
in your childhood, this fontanel bone,

01:19:39.060 --> 01:19:45.020
and push it down, press it 
down with your fingers outward.

01:19:55.292 --> 01:19:59.100
Now, move your scalp slowly seven times,

01:20:05.006 --> 01:20:07.380
pushing back your fingers.

01:20:18.926 --> 01:20:22.340
That’s all we’ll have to do. Now please...

01:20:24.193 --> 01:20:27.500
You have to put both your 
feet apart from each other.

01:20:34.352 --> 01:20:38.620
You can loosen your neck tie.

01:20:38.820 --> 01:20:42.540
Loosen it a little bit here and here, if
it's very tight.

01:20:49.372 --> 01:20:53.220
You can take out your spectacles 
because you close your eyes

01:20:53.420 --> 01:20:56.780
as until I’ll tell you, 
you should not open your eyes.

01:21:02.678 --> 01:21:06.660
Now those who don’t want 
to do it should leave the hall

01:21:12.720 --> 01:21:15.060
because they will disturb others.

01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:25.100
It will hardly take ten minutes, hardly.

01:21:27.798 --> 01:21:31.260
Now, please close your eyes, slowly.

01:21:35.598 --> 01:21:39.060
Now put your right hand on your heart.

01:21:45.139 --> 01:21:48.260
Put your right hand on your heart.

01:21:50.873 --> 01:21:54.553
Here you ask Me a very fundamental question,

01:21:54.754 --> 01:21:59.100
you can call Me, Shri Mataji 
or Mother, whatever you like.

01:22:08.466 --> 01:22:10.620
Here you have to say,

01:22:11.106 --> 01:22:16.020
ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”.

01:22:16.220 --> 01:22:18.660
Ask this question three times.

01:22:26.286 --> 01:22:28.340
Ask in your heart.

01:22:37.905 --> 01:22:43.140
If you are the Spirit you are your 
master, you are in control of yourself.

01:22:52.100 --> 01:22:55.660
So now you put down your right hand

01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:59.060
in the upper portion of your 
abdomen on the left hand side.

01:23:05.867 --> 01:23:08.380
Ask Me another question,

01:23:12.806 --> 01:23:18.420
“Mother, am I my own master?” 
Ask this question three times, please.

01:23:30.753 --> 01:23:34.980
You have to know that I respect your freedom

01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:39.260
and I can not force pure knowledge on you.

01:23:45.999 --> 01:23:51.580
So please put your right hand in 
the lower portion of your abdomen.

01:23:59.006 --> 01:24:02.780
And please ask Me six times,

01:24:02.980 --> 01:24:08.420
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge”.

01:24:22.853 --> 01:24:25.060
Six times,

01:24:26.200 --> 01:24:29.540
because this center has got six petals.

01:24:34.067 --> 01:24:38.580
As soon as you ask, the Kundalini starts rising,

01:24:39.926 --> 01:24:42.580
as soon as you ask pure knowledge.

01:24:51.612 --> 01:24:55.380
So, raise your right hand

01:24:55.873 --> 01:24:59.980
in the upper portion of your 
abdomen on the left hand side

01:25:06.973 --> 01:25:13.180
to open this center for the Kundalini to rise.

01:25:19.899 --> 01:25:24.500
So please say ten times with full confidence,

01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:30.700
“Mother, I am my own master”, 
say with full confidence.

01:25:46.851 --> 01:25:51.380
Now, the greatest truth about you is

01:25:51.580 --> 01:25:54.740
that you are not this body,

01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:59.580
you are not this mind, 
you are not these emotions,

01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:06.460
and you are not ego or conditioning,

01:26:06.833 --> 01:26:10.860
but you are pure Spirit.

01:26:25.231 --> 01:26:28.340
So now raise your right hand

01:26:28.713 --> 01:26:33.486
onto your heart and with 
full confidence please say,

01:26:33.687 --> 01:26:36.940
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

01:27:01.723 --> 01:27:05.653
As I’ve told you that this Divine Power,

01:27:05.853 --> 01:27:08.853
or we may call it the All Pervading Power,

01:27:09.054 --> 01:27:13.060
is the ocean of love and compassion.

01:27:19.553 --> 01:27:23.700
It is the ocean of bliss and joy.

01:27:28.619 --> 01:27:32.700
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:27:37.053 --> 01:27:42.860
So all your mistakes are completely 
dissolved by this great ocean.

01:27:49.906 --> 01:27:54.200
So now raise your right hand 
in the corner of your neck

01:27:54.446 --> 01:28:00.020
and your shoulder and put your head to your right.

01:28:10.999 --> 01:28:16.540
Here you have to say with full confidence,

01:28:16.740 --> 01:28:21.460
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all”, 
please say it twelve times.

01:28:23.192 --> 01:28:26.700
[UNCLEAR] Sixteen times.

01:28:48.099 --> 01:28:51.540
As I’ve told you that

01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:55.340
whether you forgive or don’t 
forgive you don’t do anything.

01:28:55.540 --> 01:28:59.440
But if we don’t
forgive then we play into wrong hands.

01:28:59.641 --> 01:29:02.740
So we have to forgive everyone.

01:29:20.402 --> 01:29:25.660
So now please put your right 
hand on your forehead across

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.740
and bend your head slowly on it.

01:29:35.952 --> 01:29:38.287
Here you have to say,

01:29:38.487 --> 01:29:42.900
with full understanding,

01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:45.460
not how many times,

01:29:46.553 --> 01:29:51.300
“Mother, I forgive everyone”, from your heart.

01:30:10.584 --> 01:30:13.580
Now for your own satisfaction

01:30:14.800 --> 01:30:20.340
you have to ask forgiveness, for your
own satisfaction, without feeling guilty,

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:23.940
without counting your mistakes.

01:30:41.925 --> 01:30:46.180
Now, so for that you put your 
hand on the back side of your head

01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:49.460
and push back your head as much as you can do.

01:30:59.478 --> 01:31:03.700
You have to say, “Oh, All Pervading Power of Love,

01:31:03.906 --> 01:31:07.240
if we have done any mistakes, please forgive us”.

01:31:20.253 --> 01:31:22.820
Now stretch your hand

01:31:28.999 --> 01:31:34.380
and put the center of your palm 
on top of your fontanel bone area.

01:31:41.712 --> 01:31:46.140
This is important, so press it 
hard, push back your fingers,

01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:49.940
and you have to move your scalp seven times.

01:31:54.878 --> 01:31:59.060
Put down your head and very slowly move.

01:32:06.527 --> 01:32:10.220
Here again I cannot take your freedom,

01:32:10.420 --> 01:32:13.527
so you have to ask for Self-Realization.

01:32:13.727 --> 01:32:19.100
You have to say seven times, 
“Mother please give me my Self-Realization”.

01:33:11.519 --> 01:33:14.980
Now please take down your hands.

01:33:18.606 --> 01:33:21.700
Please open your eyes.

01:33:25.905 --> 01:33:29.300
Now, put both the hands like this towards Me.

01:33:33.872 --> 01:33:37.100
Now, put the right hand towards Me like that.

01:33:45.065 --> 01:33:48.940
Now bend your head and see for yourself

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:54.020
if there’s any cool breeze coming 
out of your head, with your left hand.

01:34:04.406 --> 01:34:06.780
Some people get it little hot

01:34:06.980 --> 01:34:10.020
and some people get it little far away.

01:34:18.639 --> 01:34:20.740
Now bend your…

01:34:21.966 --> 01:34:25.500
Put your left hand towards Me, 
but must bend your head.

01:34:32.293 --> 01:34:37.946
Now see from your head if there’s a
cool breeze coming with right hand.
