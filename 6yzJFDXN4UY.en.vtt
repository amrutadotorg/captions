00:07.100 --> 00:11.500
I would say that your attention becomes enlightened.

00:12.267 --> 00:14.767
That means if this room is enlightened

00:15.233 --> 00:18.267
you can see what’s wrong with this room,

00:18.400 --> 00:20.400
what’s the color of this room.

00:20.734 --> 00:24.316
In the same way you start feeling your own chakras.

00:24.472 --> 00:26.581
You start feeling your own centers

00:26.800 --> 00:30.133
and then you don’t feel bad because you are out of yourself,

00:30.400 --> 00:33.634
you can see yourself, you see the whole drama of yourself.

00:33.767 --> 00:37.600
And then you say,
“Oh, I see now, Mr. ego is coming up on you,

00:37.634 --> 00:41.334
alright, go ahead.” You just address yourself

00:41.500 --> 00:45.567
in quite a humorous manner that you have been doing all this.

00:45.734 --> 00:48.500
Go ahead for a while and then you will know.

00:48.801 --> 00:51.567
Like one gentleman asked me very seriously,

00:51.567 --> 00:55.300
“Mother, if I was Napoleon in last life don’t tell me.”

00:55.767 --> 01:01.834
I said, “But what makes you think that you were Napoleon?

01:02.133 --> 01:04.467
He said, “Because my ego is too big.

01:04.467 --> 01:06.534
I can see it and I can draw very well.

01:06.534 --> 01:09.233
I have a very good hand for drawing. He too had it.”

01:09.567 --> 01:12.167
I said, “Now rest assured you were not Napoleon.”

01:12.300 --> 01:15.300
He said, “Thank God, otherwise I would have thought how much

01:15.400 --> 01:19.500
I’d have to fight with my ego
if I was Napoleon in last life.”

01:19.767 --> 01:25.667
If I tell somebody you have ego then you will be punched.

01:25.701 --> 01:27.434
You cannot get out of it.

01:27.567 --> 01:30.334
But when you start seeing your own problems,

01:30.415 --> 01:32.652
then you know you’d better get rid of it.

01:32.733 --> 01:37.300
For example, if I have some black spot on my shawl.

01:38.367 --> 01:41.334
If you tell me, I would like to take it out.

01:41.600 --> 01:44.400
But if I am identified with that one,

01:44.567 --> 01:47.200
I will not like it and I will never take it out.

01:47.534 --> 01:52.467
So the identification with,
or we can call the misidentification

01:52.701 --> 01:56.567
with yourself, your name, your all that it is artificial

01:56.701 --> 01:59.400
drops out and you become an independent,

01:59.567 --> 02:01.867
free personality to judge yourself.

02:02.334 --> 02:05.634
That’s how the last judgement is going to work out

02:05.634 --> 02:07.767
that you will judge yourself.

02:07.834 --> 02:09.999
You don’t need anybody else to judge you.

02:10.080 --> 02:12.111
And people come and tell me that,

02:12.166 --> 02:15.938
“Mother, my Agnya chakra is catching.”
means my ego has gone up.

02:16.063 --> 02:17.632
Who will say like that?

02:17.632 --> 02:21.141
Have you heard anybody in normal conditions saying like that,

02:21.196 --> 02:22.833
that my ego has gone up?

02:23.013 --> 02:27.646
But you start seeing it so clearly and you laugh at yourself,

02:27.755 --> 02:31.921
“Oh, this Mister Ego was with me and now he is showing his results.”

02:32.296 --> 02:35.593
So that is how you start seeing your own problems.

02:36.109 --> 02:38.694
You know how to cure your own problems;

02:38.851 --> 02:44.093
that’s how you cure your diseases, you cure your mental conditions;

02:44.257 --> 02:47.559
you come to a balanced part. I don’t tell you;

02:48.005 --> 02:51.840
All 10 commandments are after realization, not before that.

02:51.921 --> 02:54.655
I don’t tell you don’t do, nothing of the kind,

02:54.736 --> 02:57.230
because human beings are such that if you tell them

02:57.311 --> 02:59.779
don’t do it, they will do it.

03:00.538 --> 03:03.017
So best thing is not to tell them don’t do it.

03:03.282 --> 03:07.037
But when the light comes in, the Sahaja Yoga today

03:07.118 --> 03:10.264
is so wonderful that first the light comes in.

03:10.345 --> 03:12.678
There’s no question of cleansing, nothing.

03:12.759 --> 03:14.503
First the light comes into you

03:14.584 --> 03:17.514
and then you start seeing yourself in that light

03:17.601 --> 03:19.848
and correcting yourself.
