00:18.849 --> 00:24.800
now then we have another Center on top

00:22.070 --> 00:27.770
which we called as the heart center it

00:24.800 --> 00:29.930
is in the center now in the sternum bone

00:27.770 --> 00:33.200
behind the sternum bone this Center is

00:29.930 --> 00:36.559
there and time time us produces the

00:33.200 --> 00:40.120
antibodies in your sternum bone these

00:36.559 --> 00:42.829
antibodies later on fight your diseases

00:40.120 --> 00:45.110
when you are about 12 years of age did

00:42.829 --> 00:50.720
they go into the whole body and waiting

00:45.110 --> 00:53.329
there for a signal from your sternum

00:50.720 --> 00:54.950
bone that means supposing you see

00:53.329 --> 00:57.649
something you get frightened this bone

00:54.950 --> 00:59.420
starts pulsating when it pulsates the

00:57.649 --> 01:03.460
antibodies know there's some emergency

00:59.420 --> 01:06.469
and they get prepared for it now this is

01:03.460 --> 01:09.590
such a normal thing to happen to people

01:06.469 --> 01:12.320
but insecurities car can be of the worst

01:09.590 --> 01:14.450
time and when these insecurities they

01:12.320 --> 01:15.829
were developed people can develop all

01:14.450 --> 01:18.319
kinds of diseases of the lungs

01:15.829 --> 01:21.200
especially the women develop what you

01:18.319 --> 01:23.179
call as the breast cancer mostly these

01:21.200 --> 01:25.670
women are insecure maybe their husbands

01:23.179 --> 01:26.990
are not good or they feel that the

01:25.670 --> 01:28.159
husband may leave them alone or

01:26.990 --> 01:29.869
something like that

01:28.159 --> 01:31.909
there are certainly insecurities that

01:29.869 --> 01:35.060
are built in they might be quite

01:31.909 --> 01:37.490
frightening personalities I've seen most

01:35.060 --> 01:39.439
of the air hostesses have this central

01:37.490 --> 01:41.389
heart catch it because they are afraid

01:39.439 --> 01:43.369
they may miss the play you know I don't

01:41.389 --> 01:47.299
know they have to be on the job and run

01:43.369 --> 01:50.270
and do mostly this time-bound jobs cause

01:47.299 --> 01:52.999
you a trouble here of the center heart

01:50.270 --> 01:55.340
and this Center heart is very important

01:52.999 --> 01:57.439
because for women specially they have to

01:55.340 --> 01:59.329
be secured if their motherhood is

01:57.439 --> 02:01.909
challenged then they are even worse and

01:59.329 --> 02:04.340
this is how one has to understand a

02:01.909 --> 02:07.039
woman should be very much respected if

02:04.340 --> 02:09.289
she is your wife is your child or

02:07.039 --> 02:12.080
anything she has to be respected and

02:09.289 --> 02:14.120
given all the security is the woman who

02:12.080 --> 02:16.400
makes the society is the movement who

02:14.120 --> 02:19.340
creates the children the woman who looks

02:16.400 --> 02:20.980
after this so the men have to give all

02:19.340 --> 02:24.129
the security and the protection

02:20.980 --> 02:26.379
- the women hood and understand that is

02:24.129 --> 02:28.810
a very important factor which we

02:26.379 --> 02:31.599
phenolate we can have lots of problems

02:28.810 --> 02:33.910
with our society and the women will

02:31.599 --> 02:37.590
start competing with men and then the

02:33.910 --> 02:37.590
society will be all dislocated

02:40.570 --> 02:46.230
[Music]

02:43.950 --> 02:49.440
if there's any problem with your father

02:46.230 --> 02:53.069
in the right side caches and it gives

02:49.440 --> 02:54.720
you ask them first of all you are we can

02:53.069 --> 02:56.790
save vulnerable to ask them are you too

02:54.720 --> 02:59.069
bad liver plus if you have problems with

02:56.790 --> 03:01.140
your father or eat with your father

02:59.069 --> 03:03.300
supposing you are unhappy father or

03:01.140 --> 03:05.250
maybe that you are not looking after

03:03.300 --> 03:08.310
your children then you get the center

03:05.250 --> 03:10.739
got a very bad thing it can happen to

03:08.310 --> 03:14.910
any one of us if a man is unkind to

03:10.739 --> 03:17.489
assume it's a father principle if the

03:14.910 --> 03:20.819
son is unkind to the father so the

03:17.489 --> 03:24.090
father is hurt it's the father principle

03:20.819 --> 03:26.880
if it is disturbed by any chance or a

03:24.090 --> 03:30.959
suddenly father dies and you feel the

03:26.880 --> 03:33.000
pinch of that all your life all that can

03:30.959 --> 03:37.410
work out here and you get this right

03:33.000 --> 03:39.959
heart catch with that you get a stoma it

03:37.410 --> 03:41.730
is said that in homeopathic they believe

03:39.959 --> 03:43.830
that with more tension you get because

03:41.730 --> 03:46.319
when if you have more tense you see you

03:43.830 --> 03:47.970
remember your father if he was yet he

03:46.319 --> 03:51.209
would have met you in the subconscious

03:47.970 --> 03:57.870
some time signals and that's how it adds

03:51.209 --> 04:01.140
to the it is so simple to work out that

03:57.870 --> 04:04.049
could be amazed that if you have to just

04:01.140 --> 04:06.180
raise the principle of father in a

04:04.049 --> 04:08.670
person like that who might be dejected

04:06.180 --> 04:10.380
father who might be a cruel father who

04:08.670 --> 04:13.829
might be a son who has lost the father

04:10.380 --> 04:17.239
can be anything that you have to just

04:13.829 --> 04:17.239
put your hand on that part

04:19.490 --> 04:30.350
[Music]

04:23.260 --> 04:33.490
left-hand side of this is the essence of

04:30.350 --> 04:33.490
Mother Nature

04:34.090 --> 04:44.260
if in your childhood your mother had

04:39.110 --> 04:49.490
played a role which has given you fear

04:44.260 --> 04:52.370
or kind of a frightening experience then

04:49.490 --> 04:57.410
this Center goes out we say the left

04:52.370 --> 05:01.070
heart attack but damn if you are a bad

04:57.410 --> 05:03.440
mother all through youth like that the

05:01.070 --> 05:07.640
center is very important on the left

05:03.440 --> 05:09.170
hand side is the mother's side and the

05:07.640 --> 05:11.960
mother itself

05:09.170 --> 05:14.870
the mother is a lunatic you get a

05:11.960 --> 05:17.000
problem there you might get it we find a

05:14.870 --> 05:18.680
heart there are two hearts one is the

05:17.000 --> 05:23.060
heart of the spirit and one is the heart

05:18.680 --> 05:25.850
chakra if a mother is affinity is she's

05:23.060 --> 05:27.860
a woman who is very fanatic about her

05:25.850 --> 05:30.560
food things like that when the children

05:27.860 --> 05:32.810
get it it's a dangerous thing to play

05:30.560 --> 05:35.150
with children like that to have complete

05:32.810 --> 05:37.670
discipline on the children and just give

05:35.150 --> 05:40.370
them must walk straight like a horse for

05:37.670 --> 05:42.080
two things children should be allowed to

05:40.370 --> 05:44.000
have their freedom actually when we

05:42.080 --> 05:46.040
suppress them too much they become

05:44.000 --> 05:47.800
Milligan's that way Indians are better

05:46.040 --> 05:50.330
they know how to bring up their children

05:47.800 --> 05:53.090
with this cruelty towards children I

05:50.330 --> 05:55.010
don't know what women are up to we're

05:53.090 --> 05:57.830
not going to take their figures and

05:55.010 --> 06:03.550
their duties and everything in front of

05:57.830 --> 06:07.040
God such cruelty exists such

06:03.550 --> 06:08.960
self-centeredness then with all this the

06:07.040 --> 06:10.310
children develop this trouble and they

06:08.960 --> 06:16.550
have palpitations

06:10.310 --> 06:18.470
they have very weak hearts or when the

06:16.550 --> 06:19.250
children are not nice to the mother they

06:18.470 --> 06:22.010
also get it

06:19.250 --> 06:25.030
so mother and father are very important

06:22.010 --> 06:27.290
factors in sahaja yoga and you have to

06:25.030 --> 06:30.140
understand that if your parents have

06:27.290 --> 06:32.330
been unkind to you you must forgive them

06:30.140 --> 06:33.569
just forget about them because they have

06:32.330 --> 06:35.279
given you birth

06:33.569 --> 06:38.460
should be thankful and just forget about

06:35.279 --> 06:42.229
them that's the best way to get over the

06:38.460 --> 06:42.229
problem of left and right heart

06:48.259 --> 06:51.929
so I've explained to you all these

06:50.490 --> 06:56.939
things now this is the heart in the

06:51.929 --> 07:02.539
heart resides the spirit the spirit is

06:56.939 --> 07:02.539
watching the game of this creation

07:02.659 --> 07:11.189
it is watching what is happening to this

07:07.949 --> 07:12.860
person this person to this person to

07:11.189 --> 07:17.159
this person

07:12.860 --> 07:22.289
everybody has got in their heart the

07:17.159 --> 07:24.389
spirit which is watching is called as

07:22.289 --> 07:31.169
the shaker you mean the one the knower

07:24.389 --> 07:34.050
of the field you know what where you go

07:31.169 --> 07:37.499
what we states to create you watch he

07:34.050 --> 07:40.580
doesn't interfere if you only the

07:37.499 --> 07:43.169
interference comes from here from that

07:40.580 --> 07:47.069
which tries to give you conscience which

07:43.169 --> 07:50.189
tries to improve you from here sometimes

07:47.069 --> 07:52.319
to become part it tries to tell you be

07:50.189 --> 07:56.519
in the center by punishing you by

07:52.319 --> 07:59.639
showing it is wrong but he is that

07:56.519 --> 08:04.849
watching the game let's see how far it

07:59.639 --> 08:10.559
goes he is the knower of your teeth

08:04.849 --> 08:12.689
he is the universal green video he the

08:10.559 --> 08:18.809
reflection of that God Almighty is a

08:12.689 --> 08:22.499
spectator within and his power is this

08:18.809 --> 08:28.669
all-pervading power which has created

08:22.499 --> 08:33.659
all so to fill this all-pervading power

08:28.669 --> 08:35.579
you have to become the spirit all this

08:33.659 --> 08:39.209
creation has no meaning if you do not

08:35.579 --> 08:42.539
become listed in the Vegas of first the

08:39.209 --> 08:44.709
very first anger says that by reading

08:42.539 --> 08:47.630
Vedas if you do not be

08:44.709 --> 08:50.390
we believe with waiting what comes on

08:47.630 --> 08:53.060
whether we the means to know if you do

08:50.390 --> 08:57.649
not become the knowledge that it has

08:53.060 --> 08:59.839
don't that's the question you are

08:57.649 --> 09:02.500
talking about the spirit being in the

08:59.839 --> 09:05.120
heart chakra there over on the left side

09:02.500 --> 09:07.670
I'd like to know why it's on the left

09:05.120 --> 09:10.010
instead of in the middle because if the

09:07.670 --> 09:11.870
spirit is has to do with realization why

09:10.010 --> 09:14.390
isn't it in the middle and central

09:11.870 --> 09:15.730
Kundalini instead of on inside like that

09:14.390 --> 09:19.190
and why is it

09:15.730 --> 09:23.029
whining that much yeah I guess the main

09:19.190 --> 09:25.070
thing they not that's the last one's

09:23.029 --> 09:29.570
heart stops we don't exist

09:25.070 --> 09:32.140
she exists that's the most important of

09:29.570 --> 09:32.140
my god

09:32.250 --> 09:43.379
once the spirit is angry in any way

09:35.279 --> 09:45.990
strange anyway despaired then we don't

09:43.379 --> 09:49.940
there's nothing left heart is very

09:45.990 --> 09:56.169
important that's fine
