00:08.667 --> 00:12.867
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

00:12.948 --> 00:15.268
Don’t do anything

00:15.428 --> 00:19.108
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

00:19.268 --> 00:22.028
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

00:22.188 --> 00:28.068
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

00:28.228 --> 00:30.508
you’ve done your job.

00:30.668 --> 00:33.108
Because that’s the point where

00:33.268 --> 00:37.788
you are with the truth, with the reality,

00:37.948 --> 00:39.348
with the joy,

00:39.508 --> 00:43.708
with everything that is so fundamental.

00:43.868 --> 00:47.908
When you meditate, try not to,

00:48.068 --> 00:54.828
not to make some sort of a function out of it, no.

00:54.988 --> 00:59.228
Meditation is something silencing your Self,

00:59.388 --> 01:04.428
silencing your thoughts and the going

01:04.588 --> 01:08.828
to that deep ocean which is within you itself.

01:08.988 --> 01:12.988
But supposing you don’t do that.

01:13.148 --> 01:15.108
If you don’t meditate,

01:15.268 --> 01:17.788
I can make out immediately

01:17.948 --> 01:20.868
those who are meditating and those who are not

01:21.028 --> 01:23.588
It’s not difficult for Me.

01:23.748 --> 01:28.388
Those who do not meditate are always hesitating,

01:29.308 --> 01:34.588
they are confused, they can’t understand.

01:34.748 --> 01:38.668
And that’s why meditation

01:38.828 --> 01:43.068
is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

01:43.228 --> 01:46.948
Just like a light burns,

01:47.108 --> 01:50.268
in the electricity flowing in it, you can say,

01:50.428 --> 01:54.308
or by, because of the candles,

01:54.468 --> 01:57.868
in the same way meditation

01:58.028 --> 02:06.948
is a ‘continuous’ availability of the Divine Force.

02:07.148 --> 02:11.268
That will reduce all your apprehensions.

02:11.428 --> 02:13.308
Not only that,

02:13.468 --> 02:17.828
but takes out all the negative thoughts,

02:17.988 --> 02:24.068
it takes out all the discouraging things.

02:24.228 --> 02:28.268
And when you are meditating like that,

02:28.428 --> 02:31.308
thoughtless awareness,

02:31.468 --> 02:35.908
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

02:36.068 --> 02:40.228
from within and without.

02:40.388 --> 02:43.348
It’s a terrible power that works,

02:43.508 --> 02:46.028
this thoughtless awareness.

02:46.188 --> 02:50.508
So those who do not meditate

02:50.668 --> 02:53.268
cannot go very much far

02:53.428 --> 02:56.948
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

02:57.108 --> 03:00.268
One should try to meditate

03:00.428 --> 03:04.988
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.988
So, what happens to you?

03:09.148 --> 03:12.348
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

03:12.508 --> 03:15.028
what happens to you?

03:15.188 --> 03:23.028
Is that you get the confidence,

03:23.188 --> 03:28.388
complete confidence of Divinity,

03:29.548 --> 03:33.828
you know you have that.

03:33.988 --> 03:38.148
I’ve seen children coming from our school in Dharamsala:

03:38.308 --> 03:44.348
extremely confident and extremely humble.

03:44.508 --> 03:47.028
And I asked them: “What do you do?”

03:47.188 --> 03:51.628
They said: “Mother, we meditate.

03:51.788 --> 03:59.428
We meditate in the school in the evening

03:59.588 --> 04:02.508
and that meditation helps.”

04:02.668 --> 04:05.948
Imagine these small children can say that,

04:06.108 --> 04:09.548
so why not you also understand

04:09.708 --> 04:13.428
that meditation will give you security,

04:13.588 --> 04:17.548
it will give you real enlightenment

04:17.748 --> 04:22.508
and a complete connection with the Divine.

04:22.668 --> 04:27.028
Without the connection of the Divine,

04:27.188 --> 04:30.788
what’s the use of doing Sahaj Yoga?

04:39.628 --> 04:46.588
I know the people who are meditating,

04:47.188 --> 04:50.548
who have gone down into their being

04:50.668 --> 04:53.788
and who are very developed.

04:53.948 --> 04:58.108
Also I know people who are little superficial.

04:58.308 --> 05:02.068
Your depth is in thoughtless awareness.

05:02.228 --> 05:07.188
Is a very important point which you should reach.

05:07.348 --> 05:13.108
Looking at anything, if you are thoughtlessly aware,

05:13.268 --> 05:17.228
then you really become reflective about it,

05:17.388 --> 05:22.428
just works out that way.

05:22.588 --> 05:27.868
I don’t know how far you can remain in that condition.

05:28.028 --> 05:32.148
But even for a second you can achieve it,

05:32.308 --> 05:35.788
you’ll start achieving it more and more.

05:35.948 --> 05:39.148
I’ve talked so much about meditation before,

05:39.308 --> 05:44.748
but today when I see all these candles burning,

05:44.908 --> 05:48.228
I think they are all meditative,

05:48.388 --> 05:51.068
they are all in meditation

05:51.228 --> 05:54.428
and that’s how they are burning.

05:54.588 --> 06:00.188
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who meditate, I know,

06:00.348 --> 06:02.708
and those who don’t, I know.

06:02.868 --> 06:04.708
And if they have problems,

06:04.868 --> 06:07.988
I know why the problems are there.

06:08.148 --> 06:11.268
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

06:11.428 --> 06:15.388
is only possible when you meditate

06:15.548 --> 06:18.908
and become thoughtlessly aware.

06:19.068 --> 06:25.188
That’s the point where Divine works.

06:25.348 --> 06:27.468
It helps you.

06:27.628 --> 06:32.908
It comes to your help in such a way

06:33.068 --> 06:38.068
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

06:38.228 --> 06:42.508
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

06:42.668 --> 06:45.468
all of you should achieve.

06:45.628 --> 06:47.828
Very important.

06:47.988 --> 06:52.948
After that you can achieve something else,

06:53.108 --> 06:57.028
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

06:57.188 --> 07:04.028
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

07:04.188 --> 07:07.668
because then there are no thoughts coming

07:07.828 --> 07:13.148
from the left or right, from the present or the future.

07:13.308 --> 07:18.148
Just in the present you are there.

07:18.308 --> 07:22.668
Is something you all have, is not that

07:22.828 --> 07:24.988
Me, I’m saying that to you,

07:25.148 --> 07:27.228
but all of you have this.

07:27.388 --> 07:29.188
But ‘steady yourself’!

07:29.348 --> 07:33.868
You have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness.

07:34.028 --> 07:36.508
How long, that’s not the point.

07:36.668 --> 07:39.228
The point is once you touched it,

07:39.388 --> 07:41.748
you’ll go on touching it.

07:41.908 --> 07:48.708
Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on,

07:48.868 --> 07:54.268
they are not thoughtlessly silent.

07:54.428 --> 07:59.188
Now this is the one point which is very important.

07:59.348 --> 08:01.828
If you have to grow,

08:01.988 --> 08:05.468
you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine

08:05.628 --> 08:07.988
through thoughtless awareness.

08:08.148 --> 08:09.988
You don’t have to pray,

08:10.148 --> 08:12.588
you don’t have to call anyone, nothing,

08:12.748 --> 08:15.628
it just works because it is within you.

08:15.788 --> 08:17.948
All these thoughts are bombarding

08:18.108 --> 08:21.028
from both the sides in your mind.

08:21.188 --> 08:23.828
These thoughts that are coming to you

08:23.988 --> 08:26.668
have no meaning with you,

08:26.828 --> 08:29.748
they do not substantiate.

08:29.908 --> 08:33.068
Yourself you are an ocean

08:33.228 --> 08:39.668
and you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness.

08:39.828 --> 08:44.788
It is always described in all the great books,

08:44.948 --> 08:48.508
but not so clearly as I am telling you.

08:48.668 --> 08:53.028
I don’t say that some of you do not get thoughtless awareness,

08:53.188 --> 08:55.308
so they are good for nothing, no.

08:55.468 --> 09:00.788
But, please try, you can all get into that state

09:00.948 --> 09:02.828
of thoughtless awareness.

09:02.988 --> 09:06.148
Even for a second if you get it,

09:06.308 --> 09:08.188
it’s a very good idea.

09:08.348 --> 09:14.028
Then you go on increasing that second.

09:15.308 --> 09:21.708
I think is a reflecting mind.

09:21.868 --> 09:25.268
When you look at something,

09:26.788 --> 09:30.628
you will become thoughtlessly aware.

09:31.268 --> 09:36.388
And then this mind reflects

09:36.828 --> 09:42.268
to the depth of what you see.

09:42.428 --> 09:45.428
That’s how you all will become really

09:45.588 --> 09:48.668
very creative Sahaja Yogis.

09:48.828 --> 09:57.508
What I find, that this state of thoughtless awareness

09:57.668 --> 10:01.828
is not established by many, which is not good.

10:01.988 --> 10:05.708
Today on this day of Diwali, I would say that:

10:05.868 --> 10:11.228
“You enlighten your Self with thoughtless awareness!”

10:11.388 --> 10:14.748
It is not difficult, is within you.

10:14.908 --> 10:18.788
Because thoughts are coming from this side and that side.

10:18.948 --> 10:23.468
And they are not the waves of your brain, no,

10:23.628 --> 10:26.228
just your own reactions.

10:26.388 --> 10:33.388
But, in case you meditate in the real sense of the word,

10:33.548 --> 10:37.068
then you will get into that thoughtless awareness.

10:37.228 --> 10:40.588
Which is a very important point

10:40.748 --> 10:44.068
and all these nonsensical thoughts,

10:44.228 --> 10:49.468
which are of no use to you, will disappear.

10:49.628 --> 10:55.188
They won’t be there and then your growth is possible

10:55.348 --> 10:58.628
and you’ll grow very well.

10:58.788 --> 11:01.948
Many people are here, who will say:

11:02.108 --> 11:04.348
“Mother, we don’t get that state.”

11:04.508 --> 11:06.668
Try,

11:06.828 --> 11:08.668
try that!

11:08.868 --> 11:12.068
I don’t believe you cannot get it.

11:12.228 --> 11:15.908
All of you can get that thought

11:16.068 --> 11:19.428
that “I can get it”, and you will get it.

11:19.588 --> 11:27.348
In that you don’t have to discard anything,

11:27.508 --> 11:34.388
you don’t have to see anything, just go into meditation

11:34.548 --> 11:38.508
and you’ll be amazed how it will work.

11:38.668 --> 11:42.268
Of course you are very much there, most of you,

11:42.428 --> 11:44.908
but still, I would say,

11:45.068 --> 11:52.028
increase that thoughtless awareness, that area!

11:52.188 --> 11:58.268
Today is very important because of this day of Diwali.

11:58.428 --> 12:03.948
Diwali is supposed to be enlightenment day.

12:04.108 --> 12:09.068
But enlightenment within is:

12:09.228 --> 12:13.628
how much you are in thoughtless awareness?

12:13.788 --> 12:16.148
And the everything works out,

12:16.308 --> 12:20.188
because you are the ocean of it,

12:20.348 --> 12:22.748
you have it within yourself.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.508
Only you have to tap it.

12:25.668 --> 12:28.268
If you don’t tap it,

12:28.428 --> 12:31.388
then it doesn’t work out.

12:31.548 --> 12:33.988
You have to just tap it

12:34.148 --> 12:39.668
and you’ll be amazed that you are a source of such joy,

12:39.868 --> 12:45.228
source of such happiness,

12:45.388 --> 12:49.988
I should say, source of real enlightenment.

12:50.148 --> 12:53.668
So, today’s message is that:

12:53.868 --> 12:59.428
“While meditating, go into thoughtless awareness.”

12:59.588 --> 13:03.028
No thought is important,

13:03.188 --> 13:06.348
because it’s your own creation.

13:06.508 --> 13:10.868
But if you have to become with the Divine Creation,

13:11.028 --> 13:15.268
you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness,

13:15.428 --> 13:17.948
minimum of minimum.

13:18.108 --> 13:21.628
Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow

13:21.788 --> 13:24.628
and you’ll be amazed how

13:24.788 --> 13:29.828
you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way.

13:30.028 --> 13:32.628
Thank you very much!
