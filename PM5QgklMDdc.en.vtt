Easter Puja. Istanbul - Turkey
22 April 2001.

00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:20.083
Today we have gathered here

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.542
to do the puja of Easter.

00:00:27.458 --> 00:00:31.458
In the history of spirituality,

00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:34.333
it is one of the greatest days

00:00:35.083 --> 00:00:41.500
when we find Christ rose from the dead.

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:47.166
It is very significant and symbolic

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.458
that in Sahaja Yoga, also

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.250
what we have done,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.333
is to rise from the dead – into life.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.500
It is to be understood

00:01:03.083 --> 00:01:07.083
that resurrection is the message for all of us,

00:01:08.041 --> 00:01:09.542
for the whole world.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.291
We have to resurrect ourselves.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:20.417
There was no need for Jesus to do that.

00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:25.208
But He was a model, model of a saint,

00:01:25.417 --> 00:01:28.208
model of a realised soul,

00:01:28.375 --> 00:01:32.375
model of a person who came all the way

00:01:32.625 --> 00:01:34.625
from the heavens to save us.

00:01:36.083 --> 00:01:38.125
So this resurrection is also

00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:41.125
part and parcel of our lives.

00:01:43.083 --> 00:01:47.083
It is so symbolic, so very symbolic,

00:01:48.083 --> 00:01:50.125
that we were,

00:01:53.041 --> 00:01:56.083
in our consciousness, lost people.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.083
We had no control over ourselves

00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:04.041
as to know the way our mind told us to go.

00:02:04.208 --> 00:02:07.083
We had no balance with the mind

00:02:07.208 --> 00:02:09.208
and our physical being,

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:13.083
no more balance of any kind in life

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.250
and used to go at random,

00:02:16.083 --> 00:02:18.166
whichever way we thought was good.

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:21.250
There was no wisdom about it.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:28.250
As it is, Jesus was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:02:30.083 --> 00:02:33.083
It’s a very difficult task He has performed.

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:35.250
He used to convince people

00:02:36.041 --> 00:02:39.041
who were absolutely ignorant about spirituality,

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:44.166
who just knew about money and nothing else.

00:02:45.041 --> 00:02:47.041
He came in those days

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:53.041
when people had no idea about spirituality at all, at all.

00:02:53.125 --> 00:02:56.041
But, somehow,

00:02:56.125 --> 00:02:58.125
it all worked out

00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:01.083
in such a beautiful manner

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:05.125
that people have started understanding

00:03:05.166 --> 00:03:10.250
that He communicated that resurrection is the important point.

00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:15.083
He knew when the resurrection takes place,

00:03:16.125 --> 00:03:18.125
the kundalini rises

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:22.125
and connects you to the Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:25.125
Then you start understanding

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:27.166
that there’s a life beyond

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.041
the life that you have made.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:32.208
There’s another type of life,

00:03:33.041 --> 00:03:38.208
a higher type of life, which connects you to the Divine Power.

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.250
And then this Divine Power gives you the Absolute Truth.

00:03:45.333 --> 00:03:48.125
If you grow more and more,

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.041
you will know Absolute Truth

00:03:51.166 --> 00:03:53.125
because so far you don’t know.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.166
So we have been doing wrong things,

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.166
doing in the wrong way, getting lost.

00:03:59.041 --> 00:04:02.208
Also with listening to people who were just boasting

00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.041
and were saying they know about the Truth.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:09.041
But when you yourself discover the Truth,

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:11.083
you are a different person.

00:04:12.041 --> 00:04:17.000
You discovery is so innate and so real

00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:20.041
that you discard all that is unreal.

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:22.083
Very easily you can discard it

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:26.041
and you don’t find it difficult to get rid of it.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.041
In this conference, as you know, we have more of Muslim people,

00:04:33.041 --> 00:04:38.041
Islamic people, who have been so much misguided all over the world.

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:41.166
They have been told all kinds of stories

00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:45.041
and hatred among people or others.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.041
This Islamic bhoots

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:50.125
is going from bad to worse

00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:53.041
and people want to believe in it.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:57.083
Especially in my country there’s a very, very big problem

00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:01.125
with these Islamic influence

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.041
because they are nowhere near Islam

00:05:04.125 --> 00:05:06.166
and nothing to do with Mohammed-sahib,

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:09.333
but they are thinking

00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:12.250
that they’re correct and what they’re doing is correct.

00:05:13.125 --> 00:05:17.166
They’re trying to spread Muslim religion.

00:05:18.166 --> 00:05:21.166
What’s the use? What’s the purpose? I can’t understand.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.250
Unless and until you get your realisation,

00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:28.041
you are a useless human being, good for nothing.

00:05:28.166 --> 00:05:31.166
You can hate others, you can beat others,

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.250
you can kill others and it’s going on all over the place.

00:05:36.083 --> 00:05:39.250
Surprising thing that all this nonsense is going on

00:05:40.083 --> 00:05:43.083
everywhere in the world in the name of Mohammed-sahib.

00:05:44.083 --> 00:05:48.166
So in one shot, one side you put Christ

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.208
for another crucifixion,

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.125
on the other side Mohammed-sahib for his crucifixion.

00:05:54.166 --> 00:05:56.041
They cannot fight, you see.

00:05:56.125 --> 00:06:02.041
They’re on the same line. They’re on the same understanding.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:04.041
How can they fight if

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:07.083
their disciples are fighting so badly  all over

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:10.041
that sometimes it really brings you,

00:06:10.125 --> 00:06:15.041
when you only hear about how people are fighting for nonsense.

00:06:20.208 --> 00:06:25.125
In His life, Christ did not marry.

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:31.041
He did not and He never needed also.

00:06:31.125 --> 00:06:33.041
He did not marry.

00:06:33.125 --> 00:06:36.166
And at a very young age He was crucified.

00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:42.125
That crucifixion shows that He was not afraid of death

00:06:43.125 --> 00:06:46.000
and He knew that He would resurrect.

00:06:46.083 --> 00:06:50.083
This He had to do through the Agnya Chakra.

00:06:50.166 --> 00:06:52.208
Agnya Chakra is, as you know, is very constricted.

00:06:53.041 --> 00:06:56.083
And through that constriction He had to go through,

00:06:56.125 --> 00:06:59.166
for which He had to get killed.

00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:04.041
And He accepted that. He accepted

00:07:05.125 --> 00:07:10.041
with full heart that that’s the ordeal He has to go through.

00:07:11.041 --> 00:07:13.250
In the same way, your Sahasrara

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:16.041
can be only achieved through the Agnya

00:07:16.125 --> 00:07:18.125
and the Agnya has to be opened.

00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:23.041
But for that, you don’t have to get hanged,

00:07:23.166 --> 00:07:26.041
you don’t have to be crucified,

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:30.041
but you have to crucify your ego.

00:07:30.125 --> 00:07:32.125
The first point is ego.

00:07:33.041 --> 00:07:37.166
We have such ego that you cannot get rid of it.

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:41.208
We have subtle and subtle ways of having egos

00:07:42.041 --> 00:07:45.041
like “I have come from this country, I must have ego,”

00:07:45.041 --> 00:07:49.041
“I come from this kind of family, I must have ego.”

00:07:49.125 --> 00:07:52.041
All kinds of stupid things they do,

00:07:52.083 --> 00:07:54.208
which are really sinful and they think

00:07:54.291 --> 00:07:56.291
they’re very great if they have ego.

00:07:57.250 --> 00:08:00.041
This ego, you have to fight,

00:08:00.083 --> 00:08:03.083
otherwise your resurrection is not possible,

00:08:03.208 --> 00:08:09.041
your attention cannot pass through the Agnya Chakra.

00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:12.250
As long as they have given us satanic identifications,

00:08:12.333 --> 00:08:16.083
it will not work out. It’s a very subtle happening

00:08:16.166 --> 00:08:21.208
— very, very subtle happening — that you should see your own ego.

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:25.041
After Realisation I said, 'You know yourself.’

00:08:25.166 --> 00:08:28.250
The first thing you will know is that you have too much of

00:08:29.041 --> 00:08:31.125
conditioning and too much of ego.

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.041
Like in India, I find people have so much conditioning

00:08:36.125 --> 00:08:40.166
of their so-called rituals — very ritualistic.

00:08:41.083 --> 00:08:45.083
Everything is a ritual with them and they cannot get out of it.

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.166
That’s all the conditioning is,

00:08:47.291 --> 00:08:51.166
but ego is the worst part in the West, more in the West,

00:08:51.250 --> 00:08:54.041
where I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:57.000
In that ego they get lost.

00:08:58.041 --> 00:09:00.250
And they cannot see what’s wrong with them,

00:09:01.041 --> 00:09:04.250
with their own community, with their own people,

00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:07.041
who claim to be such and such a thing.

00:09:08.083 --> 00:09:11.125
So this ego has really dominated so much.

00:09:12.125 --> 00:09:17.000
So far in the history, so many countries, nations, have been

00:09:17.083 --> 00:09:20.333
really tortured and butchered because of the ego of some people.

00:09:22.041 --> 00:09:27.041
Once they will realise

00:09:27.166 --> 00:09:30.250
how horrible they have been, how satanic they have been,

00:09:31.125 --> 00:09:34.166
how aggressive they have been, they’ll give it up.

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:37.250
But they have to realise and, for that, I said,

00:09:38.041 --> 00:09:39.291
'You have to have your resurrection.’

00:09:40.125 --> 00:09:43.166
Without the resurrection, you will not know at all,

00:09:44.041 --> 00:09:47.166
you’ll not be conscious of what wrong you have been doing.

00:09:48.083 --> 00:09:52.250
It is very, very surprising how people go on doing wrong things,

00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:56.166
advertise them and come out as egos.

00:09:57.333 --> 00:10:01.000
When I read the newspapers, I say,

00:10:01.083 --> 00:10:03.125
'They’re all stupid people all around.’

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.250
— absolutely very, very

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:12.166
stupid in the sense that they have no understanding

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.166
of what they are doing. They are just killing people,

00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:21.041
enjoying the killing and they’re so violent it is impossible

00:10:21.125 --> 00:10:25.250
to understand what sort of life they are going to have

00:10:26.041 --> 00:10:28.083
after death – even before death.

00:10:29.208 --> 00:10:32.250
In this whole thing, you see the whole picture of the world.

00:10:33.041 --> 00:10:37.083
You’ll find all such countries who are still fighting for nonsense

00:10:37.208 --> 00:10:39.166
are very, very poor,

00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:42.041
are having very bad time

00:10:42.166 --> 00:10:47.166
and they are about to be completely finished.

00:10:48.125 --> 00:10:50.125
But they don’t want to see why they are suffering,

00:10:50.250 --> 00:10:52.250
why what’s happening, what is the problem.

00:10:54.083 --> 00:10:58.125
In the countries where there are affluence, lots of affluence,

00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:04.125
they also got lost. They too need resurrection.

00:11:05.166 --> 00:11:08.083
They have to rise above materialism

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:11.166
and see for themselves what they’re doing is wrong.

00:11:13.083 --> 00:11:14.250
They are like, actually, cheats.

00:11:15.041 --> 00:11:17.250
They are cheating the society all the time.

00:11:18.041 --> 00:11:20.041
I think the whole economics is based

00:11:20.125 --> 00:11:24.041
on cheating, how you can cheat people. And in that cheating,

00:11:24.208 --> 00:11:26.333
you don’t even realise that you are doing something

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:29.166
to make people so insecure.

00:11:30.041 --> 00:11:36.000
So this money business, also, is such that

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:39.166
it makes you very greedy and you start giving too much importance to money.

00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:48.041
This is one thing to be understood from the life of Christ.

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:54.250
He was a very simple, poor man, son of a carpenter.

00:11:56.083 --> 00:12:01.041
And to Him, money was nothing but an absolutely useless thing.

00:12:01.250 --> 00:12:03.250
To Him, Spirit was everything.

00:12:04.083 --> 00:12:06.333
And He was preaching and telling people

00:12:07.041 --> 00:12:10.375
that You must have spiritual awakening. Very important.

00:12:11.041 --> 00:12:14.000
Try to understand that there is life

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:17.208
beyond all this and then you should get

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:23.166
the best results out of this life,

00:12:23.333 --> 00:12:25.250
which you are just wasting.’

00:12:26.083 --> 00:12:28.250
He was so intelligent and

00:12:28.375 --> 00:12:34.000
the way He discussed with all those great fathers from the Church

00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:36.166
about the religion and all that,

00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:39.458
it’s amazing how a little boy

00:12:39.542 --> 00:12:44.041
could understand so deeply about religion.

00:12:45.417 --> 00:12:48.333
He was a small boy at that time, no doubt,

00:12:49.125 --> 00:12:55.041
but He was a person from the Divine, created by the Divine.

00:12:55.417 --> 00:12:59.333
He was Shri Ganesha. He’s Aum. He’s knowledge, everything.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.333
Despite that, nobody people recognised Him

00:13:04.333 --> 00:13:06.333
because they cannot recognise the Truth.

00:13:07.166 --> 00:13:09.166
They cannot understand the Truth.

00:13:10.125 --> 00:13:14.000
They are so stupid that they can only

00:13:14.083 --> 00:13:17.208
take to something that is falsehood, that is bad.

00:13:17.375 --> 00:13:20.333
And ultimately they crucified Him.

00:13:21.291 --> 00:13:25.041
This is a funny world where saints are crucified

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:29.000
and the devils are given so much importance.

00:13:30.041 --> 00:13:31.375
But now the time has come

00:13:32.166 --> 00:13:36.166
for all these people who are doing wrong,

00:13:37.041 --> 00:13:41.041
who are trying to strangle others, will be strangled.

00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:46.166
They will be all exposed.I’ve told you this is the year of exposure.

00:13:46.375 --> 00:13:50.333
They’ll be all exposed if they are doing all such things

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.208
of aggression and of greed.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:57.041
All their greed will be completely exposed

00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:59.083
and they will be thrown into hell.

00:13:59.208 --> 00:14:03.041
This is what I felt for this year especially.

00:14:03.333 --> 00:14:07.333
This has to happen, so best thing is to take to your resurrection,

00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:11.208
take to your higher life

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:14.041
and see for yourself 'What are you doing?’

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:16.333
What is the greatest thing to have?

00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:21.166
Money? Power? It doesn’t help anyone.

00:14:22.041 --> 00:14:24.125
People don’t have great name with that.

00:14:24.291 --> 00:14:27.250
Nobody remembers anybody who’s a drunkard.

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:30.208
They don’t have statues of the drunkard people.

00:14:34.041 --> 00:14:37.041
So who achieves something higher?

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:42.375
Who achieves great name like Christ?

00:14:43.291 --> 00:14:46.250
Those who have sacrificed their lives

00:14:47.041 --> 00:14:51.125
for the betterment of humanity, for helping them.

00:14:51.333 --> 00:14:53.291
Why did they do it?

00:14:54.125 --> 00:14:57.166
Because they loved human beings.

00:14:57.375 --> 00:15:00.041
They loved human being.

00:15:00.166 --> 00:15:04.041
When you love others, then you start thinking about

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:08.291
‘what is the best, what can you do the best for them?’

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:11.166
Now there are parents who are ignorant.

00:15:11.291 --> 00:15:14.166
They don’t know what to do for their children,

00:15:15.041 --> 00:15:20.333
so they try to dazzle the children  with

00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.333
lots of things and food and this and that.

00:15:25.041 --> 00:15:28.041
But children, if they are not brought up with love,

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:32.333
they’ll have no consideration whatsoever.They’ll go astray.

00:15:34.166 --> 00:15:37.333
But, in case they know somebody loves,

00:15:38.041 --> 00:15:40.458
for that love’s sake they will not go astray.

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:42.250
They will not do wrong things.

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:44.417
So the greatest thing about

00:15:45.125 --> 00:15:49.208
Christ or anyone of these great people is that they loved.

00:15:50.125 --> 00:15:54.125
They loved the people. They loved all human beings.

00:15:55.333 --> 00:15:57.291
That is what we have to do.

00:15:58.041 --> 00:16:01.333
Do we love ourselves, only our families,

00:16:02.083 --> 00:16:06.166
only our country? Or [do] we love the whole world?

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:12.166
Do we live for the whole world or we live only for our limited circles.

00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:16.041
We should find out 'What are our aspirations?

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:20.291
What are our desires? What do we want to have?’

00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:25.125
If you are really thinking of other people

00:16:26.291 --> 00:16:28.333
as your own, with love,

00:16:29.166 --> 00:16:34.166
it’s so joy giving. You may have any amount of ornaments,

00:16:34.291 --> 00:16:38.166
may have any amount of houses, any property, any money,

00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:40.166
you may have any power,

00:16:40.291 --> 00:16:43.041
you might be the prime minister of this

00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:45.125
or the prime minister of another,

00:16:45.417 --> 00:16:48.375
but if you have no love for others,

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.333
you cannot enjoy yourself.

00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:54.125
Your enjoyment only comes through love,

00:16:54.333 --> 00:16:56.375
that your capacity to love.

00:16:57.166 --> 00:17:00.041
There’s no other way you can enjoy yourself.

00:17:00.250 --> 00:17:03.375
You may have television, you may have music

00:17:04.041 --> 00:17:06.208
you may go for dinner parties, everything,

00:17:06.333 --> 00:17:09.250
but still nothing penetrates.

00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:14.166
Nothing is there to give you real joy.

00:17:14.333 --> 00:17:16.333
That’s what Christ has taught us,

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000
that He had love for all the human beings

00:17:20.333 --> 00:17:24.333
and He wanted to prepare them for the Resurrection.

00:17:25.417 --> 00:17:28.375
He came before Sahaja Yoga came in.

00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:32.333
If He had not done that job,

00:17:33.041 --> 00:17:36.041
it would have been difficult for Me to achieve it.

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:39.166
So He had prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:39.333 --> 00:17:42.041
That now your Agnyas are opened

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:48.250
and through the Agnya you can take the kundalini upward

00:17:48.417 --> 00:17:53.417
through the Sahasrara and open the fontanel bone area.

00:17:54.166 --> 00:18:00.166
All this He thought of was a part and parcel of His love for people.

00:18:00.417 --> 00:18:04.125
And that’s what He did. And He cared for so many people.

00:18:04.333 --> 00:18:07.041
He’s such a help to us in Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:09.083
Without Him, I don’t know

00:18:07.208 --> 00:18:09.166
how could I have really broken the Agnya Chakra.

00:18:14.083 --> 00:18:17.083
Because, as you know, Agnya is such a horrible thing.

00:18:18.250 --> 00:18:20.500
People go on doing wrong things through Agnya

00:18:21.083 --> 00:18:23.291
and they never feel bad about it,

00:18:24.166 --> 00:18:26.250
never think they have done anything wrong,

00:18:26.458 --> 00:18:29.500
they have harmed anyone, they have tortured anybody

00:18:30.083 --> 00:18:31.417
or they have made others cry.

00:18:32.083 --> 00:18:36.333
They go on with their Agnya, but they have no heart

00:18:37.041 --> 00:18:39.291
to feel what they have been up to.

00:18:40.166 --> 00:18:44.083
It’s Christ only. He shows us that you break your Agnya,

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:46.333
pass through your Agnya.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.500
Here they call it as a third eye.

00:18:49.041 --> 00:18:51.333
The other day one lady came with a magazine of 'Third Eye’

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.208
and when I told her what it is she was surprised.

00:18:55.083 --> 00:18:57.333
If your third eye is to be opened means

00:18:57.542 --> 00:19:01.291
Christ is to be awakened within you, on your Agnya.

00:19:02.083 --> 00:19:05.166
That’s the third eye. Now what He does by —

00:19:06.083 --> 00:19:08.125
He creates a witness state within you.

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:11.291
You become the witness of the whole drama.

00:19:12.125 --> 00:19:14.166
You start seeing the whole drama

00:19:14.417 --> 00:19:18.333
and you are amazed how you are silent,

00:19:19.041 --> 00:19:21.041
thoughtlessly aware

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.250
and how you are seeing everything without reacting.

00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:29.208
This is where we have to believe that Christ has taken

00:19:29.375 --> 00:19:32.333
His form in our Agnya.

00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:34.166
His birth is there.

00:19:34.333 --> 00:19:36.166
His resurrection is there,

00:19:36.250 --> 00:19:39.333
all that we have got it already worked out.

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:44.041
Like a machinery, the whole being’s made

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.250
and we have different, different chakras and centres.

00:19:47.417 --> 00:19:50.166
This is the last, most difficult centre,

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:56.333
which was really opened out by Jesus Christ.

00:19:57.041 --> 00:20:01.125
He’s the one who dared it and who did it so beautifully

00:20:01.291 --> 00:20:06.083
that we too have now capacity to look at our ego,

00:20:06.250 --> 00:20:09.083
to see for ourselves, ‡What are we doing?

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:13.208
Why do we think we are something very exceptional?’

00:20:14.083 --> 00:20:17.083
Once you start seeing the ego, you will be amazed.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:21.166
Whatever work you may do, whatever you may do, you’ll never be tired

00:20:22.166 --> 00:20:25.041
We get tired because all the time ego is saying,

00:20:25.125 --> 00:20:27.083
'Oh, you are so great.

00:20:27.333 --> 00:20:30.125
You are doing so much work for others.

00:20:30.333 --> 00:20:33.041
You have achieved so much,’ all that.

00:20:33.166 --> 00:20:37.125
So then the ego goes on all the time

00:20:37.208 --> 00:20:41.208
pointing out all this false greatness about us

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:45.125
and we get tired that 'We are so great and why should we work?

00:20:45.333 --> 00:20:47.041
Why should we help others?’

00:20:47.166 --> 00:20:51.375
Like that, funny ideas start falling in our mind

00:20:52.041 --> 00:20:56.166
and what we do is that we feel very tired out.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:21:00.208
Fighting with those ideas, we feel very tired.

00:21:00.333 --> 00:21:03.250
Now, our whole situation

00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:08.291
is made much simpler by the life of Christ.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.041
But look at the Christian nations. They are juxtaposition.

00:21:13.375 --> 00:21:17.333
They are on the other side of Christ’s teachings.

00:21:18.041 --> 00:21:20.041
They are the most aggressive countries.

00:21:21.125 --> 00:21:24.333
They aggress people so much

00:21:25.166 --> 00:21:28.250
that in the whole world they are regarded as something

00:21:28.333 --> 00:21:33.041
very great and like they’re the kings or something.

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:37.041
I know this because we were in slavery in India

00:21:37.333 --> 00:21:41.417
and I was surprised that these people came from outside

00:21:42.125 --> 00:21:44.041
and were nicely become master.

00:21:44.417 --> 00:21:48.291
They were masters and used to treat us so badly,

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:53.041
used to really make slaves out of us.

00:21:54.041 --> 00:22:00.250
So the slavery started and then all such things started in India,

00:22:00.417 --> 00:22:02.333
as well as abroad.

00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:05.041
Everywhere people started thinking

00:22:05.166 --> 00:22:07.250
that they are great – and they were Christians.

00:22:08.083 --> 00:22:12.041
They used to go to church and from the church what did you learn?

00:22:12.125 --> 00:22:15.041
How to dominate others, how to show them down,

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.333
how to take away all that belongs

00:22:20.125 --> 00:22:23.333
to the poorer people or to the less stronger people.

00:22:25.125 --> 00:22:27.125
It’s a thing we have seen ourselves.

00:22:27.417 --> 00:22:32.375
So this happens to people who have this ego, very, very powerful.

00:22:33.041 --> 00:22:35.375
And they try to take over

00:22:37.166 --> 00:22:39.166
things that belong to other countries.

00:22:39.291 --> 00:22:42.166
What right have they got to take somebody’s country,

00:22:42.291 --> 00:22:44.250
I can’t understand.

00:22:45.333 --> 00:22:50.375
All these complications are there.

00:22:51.208 --> 00:22:54.208
In the modern time they’re the worst.

00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:57.291
It was never so bad as it is today.

00:22:58.041 --> 00:23:03.041
We had Hitler. We had people of that kind once in a while.

00:23:03.166 --> 00:23:06.125
But the whole world was together on one side.

00:23:06.208 --> 00:23:08.208
Nobody was confused.

00:23:09.166 --> 00:23:14.041
Nobody knew that we have to fight all the time.

00:23:14.166 --> 00:23:17.333
Now, maybe because of newspapers, I don’t know why,

00:23:18.166 --> 00:23:21.125
nobody knows which side is correct, which is not correct.

00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:24.333
It’s being such a dispute about everything

00:23:25.083 --> 00:23:28.166
and people don’t try to understand the reality of the problem.

00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:32.417
And they’re killing left and right all kinds of people.

00:23:33.125 --> 00:23:35.166
It is very surprising how,

00:23:36.166 --> 00:23:39.083
in this world, human beings are killing

00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:41.208
each other much more than the animals do.

00:23:43.041 --> 00:23:46.333
We are the worst, worse than the animals,

00:23:47.208 --> 00:23:54.166
that we are killing ourselves, our own clan, our own people.

00:23:55.041 --> 00:23:57.333
In India also we are surprised how

00:23:58.125 --> 00:24:01.041
they are killing — Kashmiris are killing Kashmiris.

00:24:04.083 --> 00:24:06.291
In the same way, everywhere you go, you find

00:24:06.333 --> 00:24:08.333
they are fighting among themselves.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.000
If you go to Africa, you will be surprised how

00:24:11.125 --> 00:24:12.333
they are fighting among themselves.

00:24:13.083 --> 00:24:17.166
I mean, now the principle of fighting has come up very strong

00:24:18.041 --> 00:24:21.291
and people think fighting is a very important part of human beings.

00:24:22.125 --> 00:24:25.166
Anything you say, immediately fighting will start.

00:24:26.166 --> 00:24:29.333
Now look at Christ and His life.

00:24:30.083 --> 00:24:33.250
He didn’t fight anyone. He didn’t argue with anyone

00:24:34.083 --> 00:24:39.166
and He accepted, accepted the death on the cross.

00:24:40.333 --> 00:24:43.125
He accepted it because He knew

00:24:43.291 --> 00:24:45.250
that it is for the resurrection,

00:24:46.041 --> 00:24:48.375
for not only His, [but] for the resurrection of the whole world.

00:24:49.333 --> 00:24:51.291
And this is what we have to learn.

00:24:51.417 --> 00:24:54.333
We have to be the models of resurrection.

00:24:55.166 --> 00:24:57.166
We see all these things happening.

00:24:57.333 --> 00:24:59.333
We’re upset also about it

00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:03.166
and when after Realisation

00:25:03.375 --> 00:25:06.333
people see that surroundings are full of this,

00:25:07.041 --> 00:25:09.333
their own people are like this, they start fighting

00:25:10.041 --> 00:25:13.250
for nothing at all and they realise

00:25:14.041 --> 00:25:17.125
that 'These are my own people who are doing this nonsense.’

00:25:17.333 --> 00:25:19.333
You can’t correct it. You can’t do anything.

00:25:20.333 --> 00:25:25.083
But if your Agnya is clear, if your ego is finished,

00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:31.417
if there is no domination of any kind in your mind

00:25:32.333 --> 00:25:35.083
– and also [if] your conditioning is finished,

00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:40.041
then you become the channel of creating peace.

00:25:41.041 --> 00:25:45.041
You are the one, wherever you are, you can create peace.

00:25:45.375 --> 00:25:50.041
This is something, a special thing for Sahaja Yogis to know,

00:25:50.208 --> 00:25:54.291
that if you have no Agnya, you may look like you are suffering,

00:25:54.417 --> 00:25:57.333
but you are not. You are doing it for others,

00:25:58.041 --> 00:26:02.333
for surroundings, for your friends, for your neighbours,

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:05.333
you can say for your countrymen, for all of them.

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:08.250
When you have no Agnya

00:26:09.041 --> 00:26:13.333
you become such a big source of Divine Force

00:26:14.041 --> 00:26:16.041
that it can work out anything.

00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:20.208
It can change, transform people.

00:26:22.166 --> 00:26:25.250
It can happen like that and

00:26:26.041 --> 00:26:28.417
it has happened to many people before, individually.

00:26:29.166 --> 00:26:33.125
But now collectively I’m sure all this anger,

00:26:33.250 --> 00:26:36.166
all this temperament of aggression

00:26:36.333 --> 00:26:38.333
and all these challenges

00:26:39.166 --> 00:26:43.083
from all these nasty people can be brought to an end.

00:26:43.417 --> 00:26:47.041
With the people who have no ego,

00:26:48.083 --> 00:26:52.125
with the people who are not justifying their wrong things,

00:26:53.166 --> 00:26:59.166
with the people who have a clear cut idea as to what is the Truth.

00:27:00.333 --> 00:27:03.250
They may speak. They may not speak. It makes no difference.

00:27:04.083 --> 00:27:07.166
Whatever they are, but they are such a big shield

00:27:08.125 --> 00:27:10.125
against those aggressive forces,

00:27:10.333 --> 00:27:12.375
which are ruining the peace of the world.

00:27:13.333 --> 00:27:15.375
So Christ did it for the peace,

00:27:16.208 --> 00:27:18.166
to bring peace on this Earth.

00:27:18.333 --> 00:27:21.333
It’s very important there should be peace,

00:27:22.041 --> 00:27:24.333
but if there is no peace within, how can you have peace outside.

00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:28.291
It’s very surprising how so many countries

00:27:28.333 --> 00:27:32.333
who talk of peace are engaged in wars and fighting.

00:27:33.041 --> 00:27:34.250
How can you have like that?

00:27:35.125 --> 00:27:37.250
They have no solution. They don’t understand.

00:27:38.041 --> 00:27:44.125
The only solution I find is to transform them in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:44.250 --> 00:27:45.333
That’s the only one.

00:27:46.041 --> 00:27:48.041
You have to take out their ego.

00:27:48.125 --> 00:27:51.000
You can see in many people, it resists.

00:27:51.333 --> 00:27:53.291
It is there and working.

00:27:53.417 --> 00:27:58.000
This ego is a very, very dangerous thing people have.

00:27:58.250 --> 00:28:01.208
So this one was the one

00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:07.041
which was really handled by Jesus.

00:28:07.375 --> 00:28:11.375
He tried to neutralise your ego.

00:28:14.208 --> 00:28:20.333
He tried to take out the problems of the ego

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:24.291
to make you a humble, mild personality.

00:28:25.083 --> 00:28:28.041
To say that a humble and mild person

00:28:28.166 --> 00:28:32.166
is always intra [into] danger is a wrong thing to say.

00:28:33.166 --> 00:28:38.166
See them. When the people are aggressive

00:28:39.083 --> 00:28:41.125
and people are trying to dominate,

00:28:42.333 --> 00:28:46.375
the humble man is the winner, not the one who dominates.

00:28:47.125 --> 00:28:54.041
So main thing is now to watch out for

00:28:54.333 --> 00:28:57.375
your Mr. Ego, how it works. It’s very interesting,

00:28:58.333 --> 00:29:01.375
very interesting to see how it makes a drama.

00:29:02.125 --> 00:29:04.166
how it tries to cover up things,

00:29:04.333 --> 00:29:08.208
how he tries to show that you are superior to others.

00:29:08.333 --> 00:29:12.333
It is to be seen. It is to be seen very clearly

00:29:13.041 --> 00:29:16.166
what this Agnya is up to.

00:29:17.375 --> 00:29:20.458
It’s a very, very mischievous thing,

00:29:21.041 --> 00:29:25.041
very harmful thing and most embarrassing also.

00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:28.125
So these egoistical people are

00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:31.333
like that and ultimately they become nervous people

00:29:32.333 --> 00:29:35.333
— very nervous and think no end of themselves.

00:29:36.041 --> 00:29:38.041
First they try to control others.

00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:43.208
But then they are needed to be controlled. They are like that

00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:47.458
because they are all the time trying to control others

00:29:48.041 --> 00:29:50.250
and they don’t know how to control themselves.

00:29:53.250 --> 00:29:55.291
Who is the child crying so much?

00:29:56.417 --> 00:29:58.375
Why is he crying?

00:30:08.458 --> 00:30:10.458
Must be something wrong.

00:30:14.166 --> 00:30:17.166
Normally children keep very quiet in my lecture.

00:30:31.208 --> 00:30:34.250
Now this ego is also like this child.

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:38.250
It doesn’t hear anything, doesn’t understand anything.

00:30:38.458 --> 00:30:41.500
It just goes on disturbing everything.

00:30:42.333 --> 00:30:44.417
In the same way, our ego also behaves,

00:30:45.083 --> 00:30:48.125
without having any collective knowledge, without having

00:30:48.291 --> 00:30:51.375
'What are you up to? What you are doing?

00:30:52.041 --> 00:30:55.542
Who, are you harming?’ — nothing, just a satisfaction,

00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:59.375
such a blind satisfaction that you are doing something

00:31:00.041 --> 00:31:01.333
to assert your personality.

00:31:02.291 --> 00:31:05.125
You see, if you just watch your ego, you’ll laugh

00:31:05.375 --> 00:31:08.375
and enjoy the buffoon, you’ll see what a thing it is.

00:31:08.542 --> 00:31:10.458
‘It has been befooling me so much,

00:31:11.041 --> 00:31:14.500
what a horrible thing this ego was.’

00:31:15.250 --> 00:31:17.250
At the time when Christ was there,

00:31:17.458 --> 00:31:19.500
the people have such a lot of ego.

00:31:20.041 --> 00:31:23.000
Nobody talked about it. Nobody said anything.

00:31:24.250 --> 00:31:27.083
So this was the best way that He could show us

00:31:27.458 --> 00:31:31.542
that you can break your Agnya by sacrificing your life

00:31:32.166 --> 00:31:34.166
— not in Sahaja Yoga, not in Sahaj Yoga.

00:31:35.041 --> 00:31:37.041
But in a way, in Sahaja Yoga also,

00:31:37.583 --> 00:31:41.375
if you have an ego you should first of all the witness state.

00:31:42.041 --> 00:31:44.542
It’s the other way round. If you have ego,

00:31:44.709 --> 00:31:48.333
you cannot have witness state. If you cannot have witness state,

00:31:48.542 --> 00:31:53.417
you can have improve your ego. It’s a very confusing thing.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.041
Now supposing you develop a very big ego,

00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.542
then you go on justifying it all the time.

00:32:02.542 --> 00:32:04.667
You think, ‘Whatever I have done is good. After all,

00:32:05.208 --> 00:32:08.291
it’s very good for everyone, good for me.’

00:32:08.625 --> 00:32:10.542
Self certification starts.

00:32:11.166 --> 00:32:13.250
With that, you can never see

00:32:13.458 --> 00:32:15.458
what you are doing to yourself,

00:32:16.125 --> 00:32:17.417
what you are doing to others.

00:32:18.083 --> 00:32:21.208
It’s something, such a blind-folded nonsense.

00:32:22.166 --> 00:32:25.417
When this ego comes up in that way,

00:32:26.166 --> 00:32:30.667
then, I mean, we can have Hitlers, we can have all kinds of things.

00:32:31.208 --> 00:32:35.417
Any small point they take and form a group of people

00:32:35.667 --> 00:32:38.500
doing this kind of thing – anything.

00:32:38.709 --> 00:32:42.500
They will say that ‘Now, we are people who are spiritual.

00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:46.000
So we have a group and we are spiritual people

00:32:46.250 --> 00:32:48.458
and whatever we do is the right.’

00:32:49.250 --> 00:32:54.208
But who says it is right? By what law is it right?

00:32:54.458 --> 00:32:58.083
And we have had so many cults and this like that,

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:01.417
everywhere, where people joined them, kill themselves,

00:33:01.625 --> 00:33:05.583
had all kinds of problems. How can that be spiritual?

00:33:06.291 --> 00:33:10.250
In spirituality the first and foremost thing is

00:33:10.500 --> 00:33:15.291
that the person becomes very meek, very humble,

00:33:17.041 --> 00:33:22.041
very humble. His heart — humility is the power.

00:33:23.166 --> 00:33:25.500
His humility is the one that works

00:33:26.625 --> 00:33:29.625
and his humility is the one that glorifies.

00:33:30.458 --> 00:33:32.417
It is not the aggression.

00:33:33.208 --> 00:33:37.208
See, Hitler came and died. Who worships him?

00:33:38.083 --> 00:33:42.083
Others also came. Like Mussolini came, died. Who worships?

00:33:42.709 --> 00:33:45.667
There are so many like that who came and went away.

00:33:46.125 --> 00:33:51.166
They don’t even want to have their statue, so bad as they were.

00:33:51.625 --> 00:33:56.458
So those who have this ego are really very stupid people

00:33:56.667 --> 00:33:59.375
in the sense that they do all wrong,

00:33:59.542 --> 00:34:01.458
thinking it is the right thing to do.

00:34:01.667 --> 00:34:05.667
Ultimately, they are recognised as absolutely

00:34:06.625 --> 00:34:09.542
very, very wrong type of people.

00:34:11.166 --> 00:34:13.291
People don’t want to take their names even.

00:34:14.333 --> 00:34:18.417
So the time can prove what are they and what they’re doing.

00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:25.291
It’s a very, very calculated work of the Divine.

00:34:27.083 --> 00:34:29.542
You shouldn’t play into the hands of their ego.

00:34:30.208 --> 00:34:33.375
Try to see yourself. ‘Oh, Mr Ego, so you are there.’

00:34:34.125 --> 00:34:39.125
Try to watch. And that time, if you take the name of Jesus,

00:34:39.500 --> 00:34:43.000
ego will go away. Just say

00:34:44.583 --> 00:34:50.333
the mantra of Jesus and ego will disappear.

00:34:53.291 --> 00:35:00.375
Another side of this horrible ego is the conditioning.

00:35:01.291 --> 00:35:05.291
That also has a very, very, very subtle —

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:11.000
for example, supposing if somebody comes to your house

00:35:12.083 --> 00:35:16.542
and starts saying that ‘Ah, what a dirty carpet.

00:35:17.125 --> 00:35:20.166
I don’t like this colour. That thing I don’t like’

00:35:20.583 --> 00:35:23.583
without understanding that you are hurting another person.

00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:26.542
Talking like that, he comes inside.

00:35:27.542 --> 00:35:32.208
And then, you see how stupid he has been

00:35:32.542 --> 00:35:36.208
because nobody likes such a person who is talking like that.

00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.250
But to him, it is very important

00:35:39.458 --> 00:35:43.500
that he should correct because he has a conditioning

00:35:44.291 --> 00:35:47.125
that a particular type of carpet is good

00:35:47.375 --> 00:35:51.208
and another is not. That conditioning works.

00:35:51.375 --> 00:35:53.375
And he goes on talking nonsense

00:35:53.542 --> 00:35:55.583
that ‘This is not good, that is not good.’

00:35:56.041 --> 00:35:57.458
You cannot enjoy anything.

00:35:58.500 --> 00:36:00.417
You cannot enjoy anything.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.041
You go to any home, you don’t like it because there’s conditioning.

00:36:05.208 --> 00:36:07.166
You know of something else which is good.

00:36:07.667 --> 00:36:10.083
No – so they can’t enjoy.

00:36:10.458 --> 00:36:14.417
Everything they decide on their conditioning.

00:36:14.625 --> 00:36:16.583
[There] Is nothing independent.

00:36:17.333 --> 00:36:21.250
It has nothing to do with the intrinsic personality.

00:36:21.542 --> 00:36:24.458
Intrinsic value of that thing.

00:36:25.333 --> 00:36:29.375
Just like that, 'Oh, I don’t like it.’ It’s not good.

00:36:29.709 --> 00:36:32.667
It should not be said by Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:33.125 --> 00:36:35.125
Never use this word.

00:36:35.417 --> 00:36:38.417
You can find out from Me. I never do that.

00:36:39.500 --> 00:36:42.291
Whatever it is I say, it’s all right.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.458
I never criticize it.

00:36:45.125 --> 00:36:48.625
This criticism business comes from this conditioning

00:36:49.208 --> 00:36:51.125
because you have had such conditioning.

00:36:51.291 --> 00:36:54.333
Supposing you are an Englishman you have English conditioning.

00:36:55.125 --> 00:36:59.583
Now, correction comes.

00:37:00.375 --> 00:37:04.333
Their cows got this disease.

00:37:05.083 --> 00:37:08.625
How did they get the disease when you are such perfect people?

00:37:10.417 --> 00:37:14.375
Then in Europe the animals got one disease.

00:37:14.583 --> 00:37:16.250
How is it they got

00:37:16.458 --> 00:37:20.417
this disease when you think you are the cleanest people living ever?

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.417
Just watch out why?

00:37:24.166 --> 00:37:26.291
It’s all their own conditioning

00:37:27.041 --> 00:37:30.667
that ‘We know everything. We are the best in the whole world

00:37:31.166 --> 00:37:35.041
and we have a right to rule everyone.’ Now have it.

00:37:35.542 --> 00:37:39.625
Now those who are very rich people, like America and all that,

00:37:40.542 --> 00:37:43.083
used to think no end of themselves.

00:37:43.375 --> 00:37:45.125
Now what has happened?

00:37:45.667 --> 00:37:50.625
Suddenly it has become a country where everybody has to pity.

00:37:51.250 --> 00:37:54.208
Why? What is the reason? Why suddenly it has happened?

00:37:54.625 --> 00:37:58.166
It’s always the nature which corrects you

00:37:58.583 --> 00:38:00.625
by giving the other side of it.

00:38:02.041 --> 00:38:04.250
Anything you try to boast of

00:38:04.542 --> 00:38:07.542
or you try to put your conditioning of others, you keep it

00:38:08.250 --> 00:38:09.458
it comes up.

00:38:10.709 --> 00:38:14.583
It works in such a great manner that you can’t imagine.

00:38:15.542 --> 00:38:19.125
And then it does not work out,

00:38:19.333 --> 00:38:24.250
then there are earthquakes. All kinds of calamities come.

00:38:25.583 --> 00:38:29.166
There were a group of people who were white-skinned

00:38:30.291 --> 00:38:35.500
near the River Mississippi and they were called as rednecks

00:38:36.041 --> 00:38:39.041
because it was always hot, their necks were always hot,

00:38:39.291 --> 00:38:42.166
they were such angry, hot-tempered people.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:47.000
And these rednecks were known to be very cruel.

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:51.125
They used to kill people and put the blame on some other

00:38:51.333 --> 00:38:56.333
people from aboriginal people and arrest them and destroy them.

00:38:57.375 --> 00:38:59.458
It went on and on and on.

00:39:00.125 --> 00:39:03.125
But one day this Mississippi got flooded,

00:39:03.709 --> 00:39:09.166
so much flooded it entered all the houses of these rednecks, you see

00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:11.583
and I saw them running away

00:39:12.083 --> 00:39:15.083
with all their belongings which they could not carry also.

00:39:15.333 --> 00:39:18.333
Some of  they were leaving behind, some they were running

00:39:18.542 --> 00:39:20.625
and, while running also, they were losing it.

00:39:21.083 --> 00:39:24.083
Like that, the whole chaos took place of these rednecks.

00:39:24.417 --> 00:39:27.125
And now, I am told, they are much better.

00:39:27.667 --> 00:39:32.250
All that nonsense they had of killing all the black people and

00:39:32.458 --> 00:39:35.041
torturing them, now has come on their heads.

00:39:35.250 --> 00:39:37.500
Mississippi has taught them a lesson.

00:39:38.125 --> 00:39:42.125
So how the nature also doesn’t like conditioned people

00:39:43.041 --> 00:39:47.667
— conditioning is creating a big problem now, even now,

00:39:48.125 --> 00:39:50.166
in all the countries, like racialism.

00:39:51.625 --> 00:39:54.583
Racialism is a very bad conditioning.

00:39:55.417 --> 00:39:59.125
I mean, if somebody’s black or white or red, what does it matter?

00:39:59.667 --> 00:40:01.625
God has made that person.

00:40:02.458 --> 00:40:04.458
I always say that in America,

00:40:05.041 --> 00:40:07.667
if they removed all the people who are not white-skinned,

00:40:08.166 --> 00:40:09.625
what would be left there?

00:40:10.458 --> 00:40:13.458
They don’t know how to sing,. They don’t know how to play.

00:40:14.125 --> 00:40:16.500
They don’t know how to operate.

00:40:17.083 --> 00:40:20.166
All the Indian doctors and Indian nurses will come away

00:40:20.375 --> 00:40:22.333
and what will they do?

00:40:23.125 --> 00:40:26.667
Imagine, thinking no end of themselves, they are great racists.

00:40:27.166 --> 00:40:30.291
Even now, they are, but gradually they’ll definitely improve

00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.458
because they should know their deficiencies.

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:37.041
This world is one and you need people from every country

00:40:37.250 --> 00:40:40.000
to help each other. But this conditioning of

00:40:40.250 --> 00:40:42.333
thinking themselves to be something great

00:40:42.625 --> 00:40:46.583
the very bad conditioning. It is a mixture of ego

00:40:47.041 --> 00:40:50.583
with conditioning, conditioning giving the ego

00:40:51.458 --> 00:40:53.417
that ‘we are the best.’

00:40:53.709 --> 00:40:57.625
But I am very happy to know that after Realisation,

00:40:58.375 --> 00:41:02.333
it so happens that this resurrection,

00:41:02.625 --> 00:41:07.625
Sahaja Yogis start thinking, understanding

00:41:08.291 --> 00:41:11.291
what is wrong in their own community,

00:41:12.417 --> 00:41:16.458
what is the mistake they have been committing.

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:20.083
They just become like that — alert.

00:41:20.291 --> 00:41:22.083
And they start telling

00:41:22.208 --> 00:41:25.208
they are the ones who are doing this kind of nonsense.

00:41:25.333 --> 00:41:27.458
Imagine. It is very surprising

00:41:28.125 --> 00:41:32.125
how you become conscious of the defects of your own country.

00:41:32.417 --> 00:41:34.375
It is so important, is Agnya.

00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:37.583
That’s what I think Christ had realised,

00:41:38.041 --> 00:41:41.041
that Agnya should break. Unless and until Agnya breaks,

00:41:41.208 --> 00:41:45.625
people cannot go further and that’s why He crucified himself

00:41:46.041 --> 00:41:49.625
and then resurrected because without killing the Agnya,

00:41:50.083 --> 00:41:51.500
you cannot resurrect.

00:41:52.375 --> 00:41:56.250
All these things have worked out so well now

00:41:56.667 --> 00:42:01.417
that the whole world is seeing you like a panoramic view,

00:42:02.125 --> 00:42:06.166
of complete destruction of the nonsense.

00:42:07.625 --> 00:42:09.625
They are seeing this very clearly

00:42:10.041 --> 00:42:13.083
and you see now these people who would not even look at us,

00:42:14.208 --> 00:42:19.583
who had a very stiff nose and stiff lips and stiff neck

00:42:20.291 --> 00:42:25.041
— all is relaxed. They are wondering why this is happening.

00:42:25.583 --> 00:42:27.583
‘From when did we get this curse?’

00:42:28.417 --> 00:42:30.417
So for the Europeans specially,

00:42:31.291 --> 00:42:34.375
they have to understand the beauty

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.417
and the love and the greatness of other human beings

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:43.208
and then that will so much satisfy them.

00:42:44.041 --> 00:42:48.709
Why there is so much problem now of this recession, how it is come.

00:42:49.458 --> 00:42:53.166
Recession is nothing. It is the same Mr. Ego.

00:42:53.583 --> 00:42:59.583
It is the same conditioning, which was like a snake was eating up.

00:43:00.291 --> 00:43:02.333
Now it has receded. It is full.

00:43:03.291 --> 00:43:05.333
It doesn’t need any more. It’s quite full.

00:43:05.667 --> 00:43:11.458
And maybe it is now in danger of getting indigestion, I think.

00:43:12.125 --> 00:43:16.291
So that these two snakes that were eating human beings are receded.

00:43:17.667 --> 00:43:21.083
It’s the best time where you can see the drama.

00:43:21.625 --> 00:43:25.583
Drama of ego and your conditioning.

00:43:26.166 --> 00:43:29.542
How these two things have eaten up human beings.

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:32.250
One should feel shy.

00:43:32.583 --> 00:43:36.542
One should feel a little bit modest about it.

00:43:37.375 --> 00:43:41.458
When you are full of ego, you don’t even see anything.

00:43:42.333 --> 00:43:47.417
Or putting a conditioning on others, it’s horrible, I tell you.

00:43:48.041 --> 00:43:51.375
I can’t understand how can they put a conditioning on others.

00:43:53.417 --> 00:43:58.417
It is now, you people all enjoy, say, for Indian music.

00:43:59.208 --> 00:44:01.041
But when the British were ruling us,

00:44:01.250 --> 00:44:04.250
they used to think it was a horrible noise going on.

00:44:05.625 --> 00:44:07.583
They could never understand.

00:44:08.083 --> 00:44:12.083
Now they are paying such a lot to attend the program for music.

00:44:12.709 --> 00:44:15.709
That is also a kind of a rebuff, but

00:44:16.250 --> 00:44:19.417
also they don’t understand. Still they will go

00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:24.041
because it’s regarded as a very big fashion

00:44:24.667 --> 00:44:26.458
to listen to Indian music.

00:44:27.041 --> 00:44:31.250
So it is your ego also is so stupid

00:44:31.458 --> 00:44:33.500
that God knows when it will give in.

00:44:34.125 --> 00:44:36.458
Today it will say, ‘This is the best thing.’

00:44:36.625 --> 00:44:38.417
Tomorrow it will say, 'No, no, no, no.

00:44:38.542 --> 00:44:40.625
We should take the other one. That’s much better.’

00:44:41.291 --> 00:44:44.291
In this, I see, they have no discrimination.

00:44:44.583 --> 00:44:47.583
Basically, people have no discrimination.

00:44:48.291 --> 00:44:51.250
Those who have ego are indiscriminate.

00:44:51.709 --> 00:44:55.583
They cannot discriminate between evil and good.

00:44:56.041 --> 00:44:59.000
And such people have been now,

00:44:59.458 --> 00:45:02.417
thank God, have been punished quite a lot.

00:45:02.625 --> 00:45:06.542
But it is the life of Christ, His model,

00:45:07.083 --> 00:45:13.458
proves that your resurrection is so essential,

00:45:13.709 --> 00:45:19.500
which is so innate, that unless and until you get it, you are lost.

00:45:20.250 --> 00:45:23.500
Whether it’s a country, whether it’s a person

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.709
or any organisation. This ego that you have

00:45:28.208 --> 00:45:31.083
can ruin, ultimately, is now been proved,

00:45:32.166 --> 00:45:35.250
can completely take you away from reality.

00:45:36.208 --> 00:45:38.250
That is the thing that blinds you,

00:45:39.166 --> 00:45:41.417
which can — another ego can blind you also.

00:45:42.125 --> 00:45:44.625
Like we have those priests, we have those mullahs

00:45:45.041 --> 00:45:48.375
and all these people. They are the ones who have this

00:45:50.125 --> 00:45:54.125
tremendous power to misguide

00:45:54.625 --> 00:45:58.625
you because your ego has no discretion sense.

00:45:59.208 --> 00:46:01.250
It doesn’t even think like that.

00:46:02.208 --> 00:46:04.250
And when they are specially,

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:07.500
not so much on the ego side, but on the conditioning side,

00:46:08.041 --> 00:46:10.625
it’s even much worse – much worse.

00:46:11.542 --> 00:46:14.250
Because when you are conditioned,

00:46:14.458 --> 00:46:17.208
you start believing into all kinds of nonsense.

00:46:17.542 --> 00:46:20.166
And you start ruining your health with that.

00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:25.625
It is a very, very surprising thing how people understand

00:46:26.250 --> 00:46:29.291
and like things which are very destructive.

00:46:30.709 --> 00:46:32.291
But you can manage.

00:46:32.458 --> 00:46:35.500
These are the modern times, where you can advertise,

00:46:36.041 --> 00:46:38.667
you can do all kinds of enticement, everything

00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:42.166
and you can manage this Mr. Ego very well,

00:46:42.583 --> 00:46:45.625
which pampers you. In this pampering,

00:46:46.083 --> 00:46:50.083
ego gets completely drowned and

00:46:50.333 --> 00:46:53.375
it loses its control over its own personality.

00:46:54.125 --> 00:46:56.291
Thus, many by people get lost into it.

00:46:57.458 --> 00:46:59.709
Now Christ has sacrificed His life

00:47:00.375 --> 00:47:02.291
and then He resurrected.

00:47:02.667 --> 00:47:04.709
In the same way, all such people

00:47:05.166 --> 00:47:08.166
who have ruined their lives have to come up

00:47:09.250 --> 00:47:13.125
through resurrection. there’s no other way out  through Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:18.291
When you understand your own value, you’ll understand everything.

00:47:19.333 --> 00:47:22.083
Otherwise, what is it? You are looking through your eyes

00:47:22.250 --> 00:47:24.125
or somebody else’s eyes?

00:47:24.333 --> 00:47:27.333
You’re hearing through your ears or somebody else’s ear?

00:47:28.583 --> 00:47:32.208
It should be your own, so know thyself.

00:47:33.208 --> 00:47:36.667
When you know thyself, everything will work out very well.

00:47:37.625 --> 00:47:42.333
Out of this only, out of this category of people who know themselves

00:47:42.542 --> 00:47:44.583
Sahaja Yoga can be built up —

00:47:45.041 --> 00:47:47.583
not by people who do not know themselves.

00:47:49.041 --> 00:47:54.083
It’s a very, very long subject. I could go on on these two subjects,

00:47:54.291 --> 00:47:57.333
but the main thing is we have to be thankful

00:47:57.625 --> 00:48:03.083
to Christ for bringing this resurrection

00:48:03.333 --> 00:48:06.458
into play so that we get our discretion.

00:48:07.333 --> 00:48:09.333
Divine discretion, we’ll get it.

00:48:09.542 --> 00:48:14.583
It’s such a struggle, such a path He created,

00:48:15.083 --> 00:48:20.542
that we could go through this ordeal very easily,

00:48:21.458 --> 00:48:25.417
which will kill our ego and our conditioning.

00:48:27.208 --> 00:48:30.041
I am happy Sahaja Yogis will realise it

00:48:30.417 --> 00:48:33.125
and respect it within yourself,

00:48:33.333 --> 00:48:37.291
that you are seeing your ego and superego

00:48:37.583 --> 00:48:40.583
so clearly and that you could be above it.

00:48:42.125 --> 00:48:44.166
May God bless you all.
