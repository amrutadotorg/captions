00:00.041 --> 00:05.041
Easter Puja. Istanbul - Turkey
22 April 2001.

00:16.083 --> 00:20.083
Today we have gathered here

00:21.542 --> 00:25.542
to do the puja of Easter.

00:27.458 --> 00:31.458
In the history of spirituality,

00:32.125 --> 00:34.333
it is one of the greatest days

00:35.083 --> 00:41.500
when we find Christ rose from the dead.

00:44.208 --> 00:47.166
It is very significant and symbolic

00:47.500 --> 00:50.458
that in Sahaja Yoga, also

00:51.333 --> 00:53.250
what we have done,

00:53.500 --> 00:59.333
is to rise from the dead – into life.

01:00.500 --> 01:02.500
It is to be understood

01:03.083 --> 01:07.083
that resurrection is the message for all of us,

01:08.041 --> 01:09.542
for the whole world.

01:10.250 --> 01:12.291
We have to resurrect ourselves.

01:13.333 --> 01:20.417
There was no need for Jesus to do that.

01:21.291 --> 01:25.208
But He was a model, model of a saint,

01:25.417 --> 01:28.208
model of a realised soul,

01:28.375 --> 01:32.375
model of a person who came all the way

01:32.625 --> 01:34.625
from the heavens to save us.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.125
So this resurrection is also

01:38.208 --> 01:41.125
part and parcel of our lives.

01:43.083 --> 01:47.083
It is so symbolic, so very symbolic,

01:48.083 --> 01:50.125
that we were,

01:53.041 --> 01:56.083
in our consciousness, lost people.

01:57.250 --> 02:00.083
We had no control over ourselves

02:01.041 --> 02:04.041
as to know the way our mind told us to go.

02:04.208 --> 02:07.083
We had no balance with the mind

02:07.208 --> 02:09.208
and our physical being,

02:10.166 --> 02:13.083
no more balance of any kind in life

02:13.250 --> 02:15.250
and used to go at random,

02:16.083 --> 02:18.166
whichever way we thought was good.

02:19.166 --> 02:21.250
There was no wisdom about it.

02:22.250 --> 02:28.250
As it is, Jesus was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

02:30.083 --> 02:33.083
It’s a very difficult task He has performed.

02:34.041 --> 02:35.250
He used to convince people

02:36.041 --> 02:39.041
who were absolutely ignorant about spirituality,

02:40.166 --> 02:44.166
who just knew about money and nothing else.

02:45.041 --> 02:47.041
He came in those days

02:47.166 --> 02:53.041
when people had no idea about spirituality at all, at all.

02:53.125 --> 02:56.041
But, somehow,

02:56.125 --> 02:58.125
it all worked out

02:59.041 --> 03:01.083
in such a beautiful manner

03:02.041 --> 03:05.125
that people have started understanding

03:05.166 --> 03:10.250
that He communicated that resurrection is the important point.

03:13.041 --> 03:15.083
He knew when the resurrection takes place,

03:16.125 --> 03:18.125
the kundalini rises

03:18.208 --> 03:22.125
and connects you to the Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

03:23.083 --> 03:25.125
Then you start understanding

03:25.166 --> 03:27.166
that there’s a life beyond

03:28.041 --> 03:30.041
the life that you have made.

03:30.208 --> 03:32.208
There’s another type of life,

03:33.041 --> 03:38.208
a higher type of life, which connects you to the Divine Power.

03:39.250 --> 03:44.250
And then this Divine Power gives you the Absolute Truth.

03:45.333 --> 03:48.125
If you grow more and more,

03:48.250 --> 03:51.041
you will know Absolute Truth

03:51.166 --> 03:53.125
because so far you don’t know.

03:53.250 --> 03:55.166
So we have been doing wrong things,

03:55.250 --> 03:58.166
doing in the wrong way, getting lost.

03:59.041 --> 04:02.208
Also with listening to people who were just boasting

04:03.041 --> 04:06.041
and were saying they know about the Truth.

04:06.166 --> 04:09.041
But when you yourself discover the Truth,

04:09.083 --> 04:11.083
you are a different person.

04:12.041 --> 04:17.000
You discovery is so innate and so real

04:17.041 --> 04:20.041
that you discard all that is unreal.

04:20.125 --> 04:22.083
Very easily you can discard it

04:22.166 --> 04:26.041
and you don’t find it difficult to get rid of it.

04:27.250 --> 04:32.041
In this conference, as you know, we have more of Muslim people,

04:33.041 --> 04:38.041
Islamic people, who have been so much misguided all over the world.

04:38.166 --> 04:41.166
They have been told all kinds of stories

04:42.041 --> 04:45.041
and hatred among people or others.

04:45.250 --> 04:48.041
This Islamic bhoots

04:48.125 --> 04:50.125
is going from bad to worse

04:50.291 --> 04:53.041
and people want to believe in it.

04:53.250 --> 04:57.083
Especially in my country there’s a very, very big problem

04:58.041 --> 05:01.125
with these Islamic influence

05:01.250 --> 05:04.041
because they are nowhere near Islam

05:04.125 --> 05:06.166
and nothing to do with Mohammed-sahib,

05:07.333 --> 05:09.333
but they are thinking

05:10.041 --> 05:12.250
that they’re correct and what they’re doing is correct.

05:13.125 --> 05:17.166
They’re trying to spread Muslim religion.

05:18.166 --> 05:21.166
What’s the use? What’s the purpose? I can’t understand.

05:21.250 --> 05:24.250
Unless and until you get your realisation,

05:25.041 --> 05:28.041
you are a useless human being, good for nothing.

05:28.166 --> 05:31.166
You can hate others, you can beat others,

05:31.250 --> 05:35.250
you can kill others and it’s going on all over the place.

05:36.083 --> 05:39.250
Surprising thing that all this nonsense is going on

05:40.083 --> 05:43.083
everywhere in the world in the name of Mohammed-sahib.

05:44.083 --> 05:48.166
So in one shot, one side you put Christ

05:49.000 --> 05:50.208
for another crucifixion,

05:51.041 --> 05:54.125
on the other side Mohammed-sahib for his crucifixion.

05:54.166 --> 05:56.041
They cannot fight, you see.

05:56.125 --> 06:02.041
They’re on the same line. They’re on the same understanding.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.041
How can they fight if

06:04.125 --> 06:07.083
their disciples are fighting so badly  all over

06:07.166 --> 06:10.041
that sometimes it really brings you,

06:10.125 --> 06:15.041
when you only hear about how people are fighting for nonsense.

06:20.208 --> 06:25.125
In His life, Christ did not marry.

06:26.250 --> 06:31.041
He did not and He never needed also.

06:31.125 --> 06:33.041
He did not marry.

06:33.125 --> 06:36.166
And at a very young age He was crucified.

06:38.041 --> 06:42.125
That crucifixion shows that He was not afraid of death

06:43.125 --> 06:46.000
and He knew that He would resurrect.

06:46.083 --> 06:50.083
This He had to do through the Agnya Chakra.

06:50.166 --> 06:52.208
Agnya Chakra is, as you know, is very constricted.

06:53.041 --> 06:56.083
And through that constriction He had to go through,

06:56.125 --> 06:59.166
for which He had to get killed.

07:00.041 --> 07:04.041
And He accepted that. He accepted

07:05.125 --> 07:10.041
with full heart that that’s the ordeal He has to go through.

07:11.041 --> 07:13.250
In the same way, your Sahasrara

07:13.333 --> 07:16.041
can be only achieved through the Agnya

07:16.125 --> 07:18.125
and the Agnya has to be opened.

07:19.041 --> 07:23.041
But for that, you don’t have to get hanged,

07:23.166 --> 07:26.041
you don’t have to be crucified,

07:26.166 --> 07:30.041
but you have to crucify your ego.

07:30.125 --> 07:32.125
The first point is ego.

07:33.041 --> 07:37.166
We have such ego that you cannot get rid of it.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.208
We have subtle and subtle ways of having egos

07:42.041 --> 07:45.041
like “I have come from this country, I must have ego,”

07:45.041 --> 07:49.041
“I come from this kind of family, I must have ego.”

07:49.125 --> 07:52.041
All kinds of stupid things they do,

07:52.083 --> 07:54.208
which are really sinful and they think

07:54.291 --> 07:56.291
they’re very great if they have ego.

07:57.250 --> 08:00.041
This ego, you have to fight,

08:00.083 --> 08:03.083
otherwise your resurrection is not possible,

08:03.208 --> 08:09.041
your attention cannot pass through the Agnya Chakra.

08:09.250 --> 08:12.250
As long as they have given us satanic identifications,

08:12.333 --> 08:16.083
it will not work out. It’s a very subtle happening

08:16.166 --> 08:21.208
— very, very subtle happening — that you should see your own ego.

08:22.041 --> 08:25.041
After Realisation I said, 'You know yourself.’

08:25.166 --> 08:28.250
The first thing you will know is that you have too much of

08:29.041 --> 08:31.125
conditioning and too much of ego.

08:32.250 --> 08:36.041
Like in India, I find people have so much conditioning

08:36.125 --> 08:40.166
of their so-called rituals — very ritualistic.

08:41.083 --> 08:45.083
Everything is a ritual with them and they cannot get out of it.

08:45.250 --> 08:47.166
That’s all the conditioning is,

08:47.291 --> 08:51.166
but ego is the worst part in the West, more in the West,

08:51.250 --> 08:54.041
where I don’t know what they think of themselves.

08:54.250 --> 08:57.000
In that ego they get lost.

08:58.041 --> 09:00.250
And they cannot see what’s wrong with them,

09:01.041 --> 09:04.250
with their own community, with their own people,

09:04.333 --> 09:07.041
who claim to be such and such a thing.

09:08.083 --> 09:11.125
So this ego has really dominated so much.

09:12.125 --> 09:17.000
So far in the history, so many countries, nations, have been

09:17.083 --> 09:20.333
really tortured and butchered because of the ego of some people.

09:22.041 --> 09:27.041
Once they will realise

09:27.166 --> 09:30.250
how horrible they have been, how satanic they have been,

09:31.125 --> 09:34.166
how aggressive they have been, they’ll give it up.

09:34.250 --> 09:37.250
But they have to realise and, for that, I said,

09:38.041 --> 09:39.291
'You have to have your resurrection.’

09:40.125 --> 09:43.166
Without the resurrection, you will not know at all,

09:44.041 --> 09:47.166
you’ll not be conscious of what wrong you have been doing.

09:48.083 --> 09:52.250
It is very, very surprising how people go on doing wrong things,

09:53.041 --> 09:56.166
advertise them and come out as egos.

09:57.333 --> 10:01.000
When I read the newspapers, I say,

10:01.083 --> 10:03.125
'They’re all stupid people all around.’

10:04.000 --> 10:07.250
— absolutely very, very

10:09.166 --> 10:12.166
stupid in the sense that they have no understanding

10:12.250 --> 10:16.166
of what they are doing. They are just killing people,

10:16.291 --> 10:21.041
enjoying the killing and they’re so violent it is impossible

10:21.125 --> 10:25.250
to understand what sort of life they are going to have

10:26.041 --> 10:28.083
after death – even before death.

10:29.208 --> 10:32.250
In this whole thing, you see the whole picture of the world.

10:33.041 --> 10:37.083
You’ll find all such countries who are still fighting for nonsense

10:37.208 --> 10:39.166
are very, very poor,

10:40.041 --> 10:42.041
are having very bad time

10:42.166 --> 10:47.166
and they are about to be completely finished.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.125
But they don’t want to see why they are suffering,

10:50.250 --> 10:52.250
why what’s happening, what is the problem.

10:54.083 --> 10:58.125
In the countries where there are affluence, lots of affluence,

10:59.083 --> 11:04.125
they also got lost. They too need resurrection.

11:05.166 --> 11:08.083
They have to rise above materialism

11:08.166 --> 11:11.166
and see for themselves what they’re doing is wrong.

11:13.083 --> 11:14.250
They are like, actually, cheats.

11:15.041 --> 11:17.250
They are cheating the society all the time.

11:18.041 --> 11:20.041
I think the whole economics is based

11:20.125 --> 11:24.041
on cheating, how you can cheat people. And in that cheating,

11:24.208 --> 11:26.333
you don’t even realise that you are doing something

11:27.125 --> 11:29.166
to make people so insecure.

11:30.041 --> 11:36.000
So this money business, also, is such that

11:36.125 --> 11:39.166
it makes you very greedy and you start giving too much importance to money.

11:44.041 --> 11:48.041
This is one thing to be understood from the life of Christ.

11:48.250 --> 11:54.250
He was a very simple, poor man, son of a carpenter.

11:56.083 --> 12:01.041
And to Him, money was nothing but an absolutely useless thing.

12:01.250 --> 12:03.250
To Him, Spirit was everything.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.333
And He was preaching and telling people

12:07.041 --> 12:10.375
that You must have spiritual awakening. Very important.

12:11.041 --> 12:14.000
Try to understand that there is life

12:14.166 --> 12:17.208
beyond all this and then you should get

12:18.041 --> 12:23.166
the best results out of this life,

12:23.333 --> 12:25.250
which you are just wasting.’

12:26.083 --> 12:28.250
He was so intelligent and

12:28.375 --> 12:34.000
the way He discussed with all those great fathers from the Church

12:34.125 --> 12:36.166
about the religion and all that,

12:37.250 --> 12:39.458
it’s amazing how a little boy

12:39.542 --> 12:44.041
could understand so deeply about religion.

12:45.417 --> 12:48.333
He was a small boy at that time, no doubt,

12:49.125 --> 12:55.041
but He was a person from the Divine, created by the Divine.

12:55.417 --> 12:59.333
He was Shri Ganesha. He’s Aum. He’s knowledge, everything.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.333
Despite that, nobody people recognised Him

13:04.333 --> 13:06.333
because they cannot recognise the Truth.

13:07.166 --> 13:09.166
They cannot understand the Truth.

13:10.125 --> 13:14.000
They are so stupid that they can only

13:14.083 --> 13:17.208
take to something that is falsehood, that is bad.

13:17.375 --> 13:20.333
And ultimately they crucified Him.

13:21.291 --> 13:25.041
This is a funny world where saints are crucified

13:25.250 --> 13:29.000
and the devils are given so much importance.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.375
But now the time has come

13:32.166 --> 13:36.166
for all these people who are doing wrong,

13:37.041 --> 13:41.041
who are trying to strangle others, will be strangled.

13:42.166 --> 13:46.166
They will be all exposed.I’ve told you this is the year of exposure.

13:46.375 --> 13:50.333
They’ll be all exposed if they are doing all such things

13:51.000 --> 13:53.208
of aggression and of greed.

13:53.375 --> 13:57.041
All their greed will be completely exposed

13:57.166 --> 13:59.083
and they will be thrown into hell.

13:59.208 --> 14:03.041
This is what I felt for this year especially.

14:03.333 --> 14:07.333
This has to happen, so best thing is to take to your resurrection,

14:08.041 --> 14:11.208
take to your higher life

14:11.333 --> 14:14.041
and see for yourself 'What are you doing?’

14:14.333 --> 14:16.333
What is the greatest thing to have?

14:17.166 --> 14:21.166
Money? Power? It doesn’t help anyone.

14:22.041 --> 14:24.125
People don’t have great name with that.

14:24.291 --> 14:27.250
Nobody remembers anybody who’s a drunkard.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.208
They don’t have statues of the drunkard people.

14:34.041 --> 14:37.041
So who achieves something higher?

14:37.375 --> 14:42.375
Who achieves great name like Christ?

14:43.291 --> 14:46.250
Those who have sacrificed their lives

14:47.041 --> 14:51.125
for the betterment of humanity, for helping them.

14:51.333 --> 14:53.291
Why did they do it?

14:54.125 --> 14:57.166
Because they loved human beings.

14:57.375 --> 15:00.041
They loved human being.

15:00.166 --> 15:04.041
When you love others, then you start thinking about

15:04.250 --> 15:08.291
‘what is the best, what can you do the best for them?’

15:09.041 --> 15:11.166
Now there are parents who are ignorant.

15:11.291 --> 15:14.166
They don’t know what to do for their children,

15:15.041 --> 15:20.333
so they try to dazzle the children  with

15:20.500 --> 15:24.333
lots of things and food and this and that.

15:25.041 --> 15:28.041
But children, if they are not brought up with love,

15:28.375 --> 15:32.333
they’ll have no consideration whatsoever.They’ll go astray.

15:34.166 --> 15:37.333
But, in case they know somebody loves,

15:38.041 --> 15:40.458
for that love’s sake they will not go astray.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.250
They will not do wrong things.

15:42.375 --> 15:44.417
So the greatest thing about

15:45.125 --> 15:49.208
Christ or anyone of these great people is that they loved.

15:50.125 --> 15:54.125
They loved the people. They loved all human beings.

15:55.333 --> 15:57.291
That is what we have to do.

15:58.041 --> 16:01.333
Do we love ourselves, only our families,

16:02.083 --> 16:06.166
only our country? Or [do] we love the whole world?

16:07.166 --> 16:12.166
Do we live for the whole world or we live only for our limited circles.

16:13.041 --> 16:16.041
We should find out 'What are our aspirations?

16:16.333 --> 16:20.291
What are our desires? What do we want to have?’

16:21.125 --> 16:25.125
If you are really thinking of other people

16:26.291 --> 16:28.333
as your own, with love,

16:29.166 --> 16:34.166
it’s so joy giving. You may have any amount of ornaments,

16:34.291 --> 16:38.166
may have any amount of houses, any property, any money,

16:38.333 --> 16:40.166
you may have any power,

16:40.291 --> 16:43.041
you might be the prime minister of this

16:43.166 --> 16:45.125
or the prime minister of another,

16:45.417 --> 16:48.375
but if you have no love for others,

16:49.041 --> 16:50.333
you cannot enjoy yourself.

16:51.166 --> 16:54.125
Your enjoyment only comes through love,

16:54.333 --> 16:56.375
that your capacity to love.

16:57.166 --> 17:00.041
There’s no other way you can enjoy yourself.

17:00.250 --> 17:03.375
You may have television, you may have music

17:04.041 --> 17:06.208
you may go for dinner parties, everything,

17:06.333 --> 17:09.250
but still nothing penetrates.

17:10.166 --> 17:14.166
Nothing is there to give you real joy.

17:14.333 --> 17:16.333
That’s what Christ has taught us,

17:17.000 --> 17:20.000
that He had love for all the human beings

17:20.333 --> 17:24.333
and He wanted to prepare them for the Resurrection.

17:25.417 --> 17:28.375
He came before Sahaja Yoga came in.

17:29.250 --> 17:32.333
If He had not done that job,

17:33.041 --> 17:36.041
it would have been difficult for Me to achieve it.

17:36.250 --> 17:39.166
So He had prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga.

17:39.333 --> 17:42.041
That now your Agnyas are opened

17:43.250 --> 17:48.250
and through the Agnya you can take the kundalini upward

17:48.417 --> 17:53.417
through the Sahasrara and open the fontanel bone area.

17:54.166 --> 18:00.166
All this He thought of was a part and parcel of His love for people.

18:00.417 --> 18:04.125
And that’s what He did. And He cared for so many people.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.041
He’s such a help to us in Sahaja Yoga.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.083
Without Him, I don’t know

18:07.208 --> 18:09.166
how could I have really broken the Agnya Chakra.

18:14.083 --> 18:17.083
Because, as you know, Agnya is such a horrible thing.

18:18.250 --> 18:20.500
People go on doing wrong things through Agnya

18:21.083 --> 18:23.291
and they never feel bad about it,

18:24.166 --> 18:26.250
never think they have done anything wrong,

18:26.458 --> 18:29.500
they have harmed anyone, they have tortured anybody

18:30.083 --> 18:31.417
or they have made others cry.

18:32.083 --> 18:36.333
They go on with their Agnya, but they have no heart

18:37.041 --> 18:39.291
to feel what they have been up to.

18:40.166 --> 18:44.083
It’s Christ only. He shows us that you break your Agnya,

18:44.458 --> 18:46.333
pass through your Agnya.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.500
Here they call it as a third eye.

18:49.041 --> 18:51.333
The other day one lady came with a magazine of 'Third Eye’

18:52.000 --> 18:54.208
and when I told her what it is she was surprised.

18:55.083 --> 18:57.333
If your third eye is to be opened means

18:57.542 --> 19:01.291
Christ is to be awakened within you, on your Agnya.

19:02.083 --> 19:05.166
That’s the third eye. Now what He does by —

19:06.083 --> 19:08.125
He creates a witness state within you.

19:09.250 --> 19:11.291
You become the witness of the whole drama.

19:12.125 --> 19:14.166
You start seeing the whole drama

19:14.417 --> 19:18.333
and you are amazed how you are silent,

19:19.041 --> 19:21.041
thoughtlessly aware

19:21.250 --> 19:24.250
and how you are seeing everything without reacting.

19:25.250 --> 19:29.208
This is where we have to believe that Christ has taken

19:29.375 --> 19:32.333
His form in our Agnya.

19:33.041 --> 19:34.166
His birth is there.

19:34.333 --> 19:36.166
His resurrection is there,

19:36.250 --> 19:39.333
all that we have got it already worked out.

19:40.125 --> 19:44.041
Like a machinery, the whole being’s made

19:44.250 --> 19:47.250
and we have different, different chakras and centres.

19:47.417 --> 19:50.166
This is the last, most difficult centre,

19:50.333 --> 19:56.333
which was really opened out by Jesus Christ.

19:57.041 --> 20:01.125
He’s the one who dared it and who did it so beautifully

20:01.291 --> 20:06.083
that we too have now capacity to look at our ego,

20:06.250 --> 20:09.083
to see for ourselves, ‡What are we doing?

20:09.333 --> 20:13.208
Why do we think we are something very exceptional?’

20:14.083 --> 20:17.083
Once you start seeing the ego, you will be amazed.

20:17.250 --> 20:21.166
Whatever work you may do, whatever you may do, you’ll never be tired

20:22.166 --> 20:25.041
We get tired because all the time ego is saying,

20:25.125 --> 20:27.083
'Oh, you are so great.

20:27.333 --> 20:30.125
You are doing so much work for others.

20:30.333 --> 20:33.041
You have achieved so much,’ all that.

20:33.166 --> 20:37.125
So then the ego goes on all the time

20:37.208 --> 20:41.208
pointing out all this false greatness about us

20:41.333 --> 20:45.125
and we get tired that 'We are so great and why should we work?

20:45.333 --> 20:47.041
Why should we help others?’

20:47.166 --> 20:51.375
Like that, funny ideas start falling in our mind

20:52.041 --> 20:56.166
and what we do is that we feel very tired out.

20:57.250 --> 21:00.208
Fighting with those ideas, we feel very tired.

21:00.333 --> 21:03.250
Now, our whole situation

21:04.333 --> 21:08.291
is made much simpler by the life of Christ.

21:09.000 --> 21:13.041
But look at the Christian nations. They are juxtaposition.

21:13.375 --> 21:17.333
They are on the other side of Christ’s teachings.

21:18.041 --> 21:20.041
They are the most aggressive countries.

21:21.125 --> 21:24.333
They aggress people so much

21:25.166 --> 21:28.250
that in the whole world they are regarded as something

21:28.333 --> 21:33.041
very great and like they’re the kings or something.

21:33.166 --> 21:37.041
I know this because we were in slavery in India

21:37.333 --> 21:41.417
and I was surprised that these people came from outside

21:42.125 --> 21:44.041
and were nicely become master.

21:44.417 --> 21:48.291
They were masters and used to treat us so badly,

21:49.041 --> 21:53.041
used to really make slaves out of us.

21:54.041 --> 22:00.250
So the slavery started and then all such things started in India,

22:00.417 --> 22:02.333
as well as abroad.

22:03.041 --> 22:05.041
Everywhere people started thinking

22:05.166 --> 22:07.250
that they are great – and they were Christians.

22:08.083 --> 22:12.041
They used to go to church and from the church what did you learn?

22:12.125 --> 22:15.041
How to dominate others, how to show them down,

22:15.250 --> 22:19.333
how to take away all that belongs

22:20.125 --> 22:23.333
to the poorer people or to the less stronger people.

22:25.125 --> 22:27.125
It’s a thing we have seen ourselves.

22:27.417 --> 22:32.375
So this happens to people who have this ego, very, very powerful.

22:33.041 --> 22:35.375
And they try to take over

22:37.166 --> 22:39.166
things that belong to other countries.

22:39.291 --> 22:42.166
What right have they got to take somebody’s country,

22:42.291 --> 22:44.250
I can’t understand.

22:45.333 --> 22:50.375
All these complications are there.

22:51.208 --> 22:54.208
In the modern time they’re the worst.

22:54.375 --> 22:57.291
It was never so bad as it is today.

22:58.041 --> 23:03.041
We had Hitler. We had people of that kind once in a while.

23:03.166 --> 23:06.125
But the whole world was together on one side.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.208
Nobody was confused.

23:09.166 --> 23:14.041
Nobody knew that we have to fight all the time.

23:14.166 --> 23:17.333
Now, maybe because of newspapers, I don’t know why,

23:18.166 --> 23:21.125
nobody knows which side is correct, which is not correct.

23:21.417 --> 23:24.333
It’s being such a dispute about everything

23:25.083 --> 23:28.166
and people don’t try to understand the reality of the problem.

23:29.250 --> 23:32.417
And they’re killing left and right all kinds of people.

23:33.125 --> 23:35.166
It is very surprising how,

23:36.166 --> 23:39.083
in this world, human beings are killing

23:39.208 --> 23:41.208
each other much more than the animals do.

23:43.041 --> 23:46.333
We are the worst, worse than the animals,

23:47.208 --> 23:54.166
that we are killing ourselves, our own clan, our own people.

23:55.041 --> 23:57.333
In India also we are surprised how

23:58.125 --> 24:01.041
they are killing — Kashmiris are killing Kashmiris.

24:04.083 --> 24:06.291
In the same way, everywhere you go, you find

24:06.333 --> 24:08.333
they are fighting among themselves.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.000
If you go to Africa, you will be surprised how

24:11.125 --> 24:12.333
they are fighting among themselves.

24:13.083 --> 24:17.166
I mean, now the principle of fighting has come up very strong

24:18.041 --> 24:21.291
and people think fighting is a very important part of human beings.

24:22.125 --> 24:25.166
Anything you say, immediately fighting will start.

24:26.166 --> 24:29.333
Now look at Christ and His life.

24:30.083 --> 24:33.250
He didn’t fight anyone. He didn’t argue with anyone

24:34.083 --> 24:39.166
and He accepted, accepted the death on the cross.

24:40.333 --> 24:43.125
He accepted it because He knew

24:43.291 --> 24:45.250
that it is for the resurrection,

24:46.041 --> 24:48.375
for not only His, [but] for the resurrection of the whole world.

24:49.333 --> 24:51.291
And this is what we have to learn.

24:51.417 --> 24:54.333
We have to be the models of resurrection.

24:55.166 --> 24:57.166
We see all these things happening.

24:57.333 --> 24:59.333
We’re upset also about it

25:00.166 --> 25:03.166
and when after Realisation

25:03.375 --> 25:06.333
people see that surroundings are full of this,

25:07.041 --> 25:09.333
their own people are like this, they start fighting

25:10.041 --> 25:13.250
for nothing at all and they realise

25:14.041 --> 25:17.125
that 'These are my own people who are doing this nonsense.’

25:17.333 --> 25:19.333
You can’t correct it. You can’t do anything.

25:20.333 --> 25:25.083
But if your Agnya is clear, if your ego is finished,

25:25.166 --> 25:31.417
if there is no domination of any kind in your mind

25:32.333 --> 25:35.083
– and also [if] your conditioning is finished,

25:35.333 --> 25:40.041
then you become the channel of creating peace.

25:41.041 --> 25:45.041
You are the one, wherever you are, you can create peace.

25:45.375 --> 25:50.041
This is something, a special thing for Sahaja Yogis to know,

25:50.208 --> 25:54.291
that if you have no Agnya, you may look like you are suffering,

25:54.417 --> 25:57.333
but you are not. You are doing it for others,

25:58.041 --> 26:02.333
for surroundings, for your friends, for your neighbours,

26:03.125 --> 26:05.333
you can say for your countrymen, for all of them.

26:06.250 --> 26:08.250
When you have no Agnya

26:09.041 --> 26:13.333
you become such a big source of Divine Force

26:14.041 --> 26:16.041
that it can work out anything.

26:17.208 --> 26:20.208
It can change, transform people.

26:22.166 --> 26:25.250
It can happen like that and

26:26.041 --> 26:28.417
it has happened to many people before, individually.

26:29.166 --> 26:33.125
But now collectively I’m sure all this anger,

26:33.250 --> 26:36.166
all this temperament of aggression

26:36.333 --> 26:38.333
and all these challenges

26:39.166 --> 26:43.083
from all these nasty people can be brought to an end.

26:43.417 --> 26:47.041
With the people who have no ego,

26:48.083 --> 26:52.125
with the people who are not justifying their wrong things,

26:53.166 --> 26:59.166
with the people who have a clear cut idea as to what is the Truth.

27:00.333 --> 27:03.250
They may speak. They may not speak. It makes no difference.

27:04.083 --> 27:07.166
Whatever they are, but they are such a big shield

27:08.125 --> 27:10.125
against those aggressive forces,

27:10.333 --> 27:12.375
which are ruining the peace of the world.

27:13.333 --> 27:15.375
So Christ did it for the peace,

27:16.208 --> 27:18.166
to bring peace on this Earth.

27:18.333 --> 27:21.333
It’s very important there should be peace,

27:22.041 --> 27:24.333
but if there is no peace within, how can you have peace outside.

27:25.250 --> 27:28.291
It’s very surprising how so many countries

27:28.333 --> 27:32.333
who talk of peace are engaged in wars and fighting.

27:33.041 --> 27:34.250
How can you have like that?

27:35.125 --> 27:37.250
They have no solution. They don’t understand.

27:38.041 --> 27:44.125
The only solution I find is to transform them in Sahaja Yoga.

27:44.250 --> 27:45.333
That’s the only one.

27:46.041 --> 27:48.041
You have to take out their ego.

27:48.125 --> 27:51.000
You can see in many people, it resists.

27:51.333 --> 27:53.291
It is there and working.

27:53.417 --> 27:58.000
This ego is a very, very dangerous thing people have.

27:58.250 --> 28:01.208
So this one was the one

28:02.041 --> 28:07.041
which was really handled by Jesus.

28:07.375 --> 28:11.375
He tried to neutralise your ego.

28:14.208 --> 28:20.333
He tried to take out the problems of the ego

28:21.250 --> 28:24.291
to make you a humble, mild personality.

28:25.083 --> 28:28.041
To say that a humble and mild person

28:28.166 --> 28:32.166
is always intra [into] danger is a wrong thing to say.

28:33.166 --> 28:38.166
See them. When the people are aggressive

28:39.083 --> 28:41.125
and people are trying to dominate,

28:42.333 --> 28:46.375
the humble man is the winner, not the one who dominates.

28:47.125 --> 28:54.041
So main thing is now to watch out for

28:54.333 --> 28:57.375
your Mr. Ego, how it works. It’s very interesting,

28:58.333 --> 29:01.375
very interesting to see how it makes a drama.

29:02.125 --> 29:04.166
how it tries to cover up things,

29:04.333 --> 29:08.208
how he tries to show that you are superior to others.

29:08.333 --> 29:12.333
It is to be seen. It is to be seen very clearly

29:13.041 --> 29:16.166
what this Agnya is up to.

29:17.375 --> 29:20.458
It’s a very, very mischievous thing,

29:21.041 --> 29:25.041
very harmful thing and most embarrassing also.

29:25.458 --> 29:28.125
So these egoistical people are

29:28.291 --> 29:31.333
like that and ultimately they become nervous people

29:32.333 --> 29:35.333
— very nervous and think no end of themselves.

29:36.041 --> 29:38.041
First they try to control others.

29:38.500 --> 29:43.208
But then they are needed to be controlled. They are like that

29:43.333 --> 29:47.458
because they are all the time trying to control others

29:48.041 --> 29:50.250
and they don’t know how to control themselves.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.291
Who is the child crying so much?

29:56.417 --> 29:58.375
Why is he crying?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.458
Must be something wrong.

30:14.166 --> 30:17.166
Normally children keep very quiet in my lecture.

30:31.208 --> 30:34.250
Now this ego is also like this child.

30:35.250 --> 30:38.250
It doesn’t hear anything, doesn’t understand anything.

30:38.458 --> 30:41.500
It just goes on disturbing everything.

30:42.333 --> 30:44.417
In the same way, our ego also behaves,

30:45.083 --> 30:48.125
without having any collective knowledge, without having

30:48.291 --> 30:51.375
'What are you up to? What you are doing?

30:52.041 --> 30:55.542
Who, are you harming?’ — nothing, just a satisfaction,

30:56.125 --> 30:59.375
such a blind satisfaction that you are doing something

31:00.041 --> 31:01.333
to assert your personality.

31:02.291 --> 31:05.125
You see, if you just watch your ego, you’ll laugh

31:05.375 --> 31:08.375
and enjoy the buffoon, you’ll see what a thing it is.

31:08.542 --> 31:10.458
‘It has been befooling me so much,

31:11.041 --> 31:14.500
what a horrible thing this ego was.’

31:15.250 --> 31:17.250
At the time when Christ was there,

31:17.458 --> 31:19.500
the people have such a lot of ego.

31:20.041 --> 31:23.000
Nobody talked about it. Nobody said anything.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.083
So this was the best way that He could show us

31:27.458 --> 31:31.542
that you can break your Agnya by sacrificing your life

31:32.166 --> 31:34.166
— not in Sahaja Yoga, not in Sahaj Yoga.

31:35.041 --> 31:37.041
But in a way, in Sahaja Yoga also,

31:37.583 --> 31:41.375
if you have an ego you should first of all the witness state.

31:42.041 --> 31:44.542
It’s the other way round. If you have ego,

31:44.709 --> 31:48.333
you cannot have witness state. If you cannot have witness state,

31:48.542 --> 31:53.417
you can have improve your ego. It’s a very confusing thing.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.041
Now supposing you develop a very big ego,

31:59.500 --> 32:01.542
then you go on justifying it all the time.

32:02.542 --> 32:04.667
You think, ‘Whatever I have done is good. After all,

32:05.208 --> 32:08.291
it’s very good for everyone, good for me.’

32:08.625 --> 32:10.542
Self certification starts.

32:11.166 --> 32:13.250
With that, you can never see

32:13.458 --> 32:15.458
what you are doing to yourself,

32:16.125 --> 32:17.417
what you are doing to others.

32:18.083 --> 32:21.208
It’s something, such a blind-folded nonsense.

32:22.166 --> 32:25.417
When this ego comes up in that way,

32:26.166 --> 32:30.667
then, I mean, we can have Hitlers, we can have all kinds of things.

32:31.208 --> 32:35.417
Any small point they take and form a group of people

32:35.667 --> 32:38.500
doing this kind of thing – anything.

32:38.709 --> 32:42.500
They will say that ‘Now, we are people who are spiritual.

32:43.125 --> 32:46.000
So we have a group and we are spiritual people

32:46.250 --> 32:48.458
and whatever we do is the right.’

32:49.250 --> 32:54.208
But who says it is right? By what law is it right?

32:54.458 --> 32:58.083
And we have had so many cults and this like that,

32:58.250 --> 33:01.417
everywhere, where people joined them, kill themselves,

33:01.625 --> 33:05.583
had all kinds of problems. How can that be spiritual?

33:06.291 --> 33:10.250
In spirituality the first and foremost thing is

33:10.500 --> 33:15.291
that the person becomes very meek, very humble,

33:17.041 --> 33:22.041
very humble. His heart — humility is the power.

33:23.166 --> 33:25.500
His humility is the one that works

33:26.625 --> 33:29.625
and his humility is the one that glorifies.

33:30.458 --> 33:32.417
It is not the aggression.

33:33.208 --> 33:37.208
See, Hitler came and died. Who worships him?

33:38.083 --> 33:42.083
Others also came. Like Mussolini came, died. Who worships?

33:42.709 --> 33:45.667
There are so many like that who came and went away.

33:46.125 --> 33:51.166
They don’t even want to have their statue, so bad as they were.

33:51.625 --> 33:56.458
So those who have this ego are really very stupid people

33:56.667 --> 33:59.375
in the sense that they do all wrong,

33:59.542 --> 34:01.458
thinking it is the right thing to do.

34:01.667 --> 34:05.667
Ultimately, they are recognised as absolutely

34:06.625 --> 34:09.542
very, very wrong type of people.

34:11.166 --> 34:13.291
People don’t want to take their names even.

34:14.333 --> 34:18.417
So the time can prove what are they and what they’re doing.

34:19.500 --> 34:25.291
It’s a very, very calculated work of the Divine.

34:27.083 --> 34:29.542
You shouldn’t play into the hands of their ego.

34:30.208 --> 34:33.375
Try to see yourself. ‘Oh, Mr Ego, so you are there.’

34:34.125 --> 34:39.125
Try to watch. And that time, if you take the name of Jesus,

34:39.500 --> 34:43.000
ego will go away. Just say

34:44.583 --> 34:50.333
the mantra of Jesus and ego will disappear.

34:53.291 --> 35:00.375
Another side of this horrible ego is the conditioning.

35:01.291 --> 35:05.291
That also has a very, very, very subtle —

35:06.000 --> 35:11.000
for example, supposing if somebody comes to your house

35:12.083 --> 35:16.542
and starts saying that ‘Ah, what a dirty carpet.

35:17.125 --> 35:20.166
I don’t like this colour. That thing I don’t like’

35:20.583 --> 35:23.583
without understanding that you are hurting another person.

35:24.500 --> 35:26.542
Talking like that, he comes inside.

35:27.542 --> 35:32.208
And then, you see how stupid he has been

35:32.542 --> 35:36.208
because nobody likes such a person who is talking like that.

35:36.500 --> 35:39.250
But to him, it is very important

35:39.458 --> 35:43.500
that he should correct because he has a conditioning

35:44.291 --> 35:47.125
that a particular type of carpet is good

35:47.375 --> 35:51.208
and another is not. That conditioning works.

35:51.375 --> 35:53.375
And he goes on talking nonsense

35:53.542 --> 35:55.583
that ‘This is not good, that is not good.’

35:56.041 --> 35:57.458
You cannot enjoy anything.

35:58.500 --> 36:00.417
You cannot enjoy anything.

36:01.000 --> 36:05.041
You go to any home, you don’t like it because there’s conditioning.

36:05.208 --> 36:07.166
You know of something else which is good.

36:07.667 --> 36:10.083
No – so they can’t enjoy.

36:10.458 --> 36:14.417
Everything they decide on their conditioning.

36:14.625 --> 36:16.583
[There] Is nothing independent.

36:17.333 --> 36:21.250
It has nothing to do with the intrinsic personality.

36:21.542 --> 36:24.458
Intrinsic value of that thing.

36:25.333 --> 36:29.375
Just like that, 'Oh, I don’t like it.’ It’s not good.

36:29.709 --> 36:32.667
It should not be said by Sahaja Yogis.

36:33.125 --> 36:35.125
Never use this word.

36:35.417 --> 36:38.417
You can find out from Me. I never do that.

36:39.500 --> 36:42.291
Whatever it is I say, it’s all right.

36:42.500 --> 36:44.458
I never criticize it.

36:45.125 --> 36:48.625
This criticism business comes from this conditioning

36:49.208 --> 36:51.125
because you have had such conditioning.

36:51.291 --> 36:54.333
Supposing you are an Englishman you have English conditioning.

36:55.125 --> 36:59.583
Now, correction comes.

37:00.375 --> 37:04.333
Their cows got this disease.

37:05.083 --> 37:08.625
How did they get the disease when you are such perfect people?

37:10.417 --> 37:14.375
Then in Europe the animals got one disease.

37:14.583 --> 37:16.250
How is it they got

37:16.458 --> 37:20.417
this disease when you think you are the cleanest people living ever?

37:22.000 --> 37:23.417
Just watch out why?

37:24.166 --> 37:26.291
It’s all their own conditioning

37:27.041 --> 37:30.667
that ‘We know everything. We are the best in the whole world

37:31.166 --> 37:35.041
and we have a right to rule everyone.’ Now have it.

37:35.542 --> 37:39.625
Now those who are very rich people, like America and all that,

37:40.542 --> 37:43.083
used to think no end of themselves.

37:43.375 --> 37:45.125
Now what has happened?

37:45.667 --> 37:50.625
Suddenly it has become a country where everybody has to pity.

37:51.250 --> 37:54.208
Why? What is the reason? Why suddenly it has happened?

37:54.625 --> 37:58.166
It’s always the nature which corrects you

37:58.583 --> 38:00.625
by giving the other side of it.

38:02.041 --> 38:04.250
Anything you try to boast of

38:04.542 --> 38:07.542
or you try to put your conditioning of others, you keep it

38:08.250 --> 38:09.458
it comes up.

38:10.709 --> 38:14.583
It works in such a great manner that you can’t imagine.

38:15.542 --> 38:19.125
And then it does not work out,

38:19.333 --> 38:24.250
then there are earthquakes. All kinds of calamities come.

38:25.583 --> 38:29.166
There were a group of people who were white-skinned

38:30.291 --> 38:35.500
near the River Mississippi and they were called as rednecks

38:36.041 --> 38:39.041
because it was always hot, their necks were always hot,

38:39.291 --> 38:42.166
they were such angry, hot-tempered people.

38:43.000 --> 38:47.000
And these rednecks were known to be very cruel.

38:47.291 --> 38:51.125
They used to kill people and put the blame on some other

38:51.333 --> 38:56.333
people from aboriginal people and arrest them and destroy them.

38:57.375 --> 38:59.458
It went on and on and on.

39:00.125 --> 39:03.125
But one day this Mississippi got flooded,

39:03.709 --> 39:09.166
so much flooded it entered all the houses of these rednecks, you see

39:09.667 --> 39:11.583
and I saw them running away

39:12.083 --> 39:15.083
with all their belongings which they could not carry also.

39:15.333 --> 39:18.333
Some of  they were leaving behind, some they were running

39:18.542 --> 39:20.625
and, while running also, they were losing it.

39:21.083 --> 39:24.083
Like that, the whole chaos took place of these rednecks.

39:24.417 --> 39:27.125
And now, I am told, they are much better.

39:27.667 --> 39:32.250
All that nonsense they had of killing all the black people and

39:32.458 --> 39:35.041
torturing them, now has come on their heads.

39:35.250 --> 39:37.500
Mississippi has taught them a lesson.

39:38.125 --> 39:42.125
So how the nature also doesn’t like conditioned people

39:43.041 --> 39:47.667
— conditioning is creating a big problem now, even now,

39:48.125 --> 39:50.166
in all the countries, like racialism.

39:51.625 --> 39:54.583
Racialism is a very bad conditioning.

39:55.417 --> 39:59.125
I mean, if somebody’s black or white or red, what does it matter?

39:59.667 --> 40:01.625
God has made that person.

40:02.458 --> 40:04.458
I always say that in America,

40:05.041 --> 40:07.667
if they removed all the people who are not white-skinned,

40:08.166 --> 40:09.625
what would be left there?

40:10.458 --> 40:13.458
They don’t know how to sing,. They don’t know how to play.

40:14.125 --> 40:16.500
They don’t know how to operate.

40:17.083 --> 40:20.166
All the Indian doctors and Indian nurses will come away

40:20.375 --> 40:22.333
and what will they do?

40:23.125 --> 40:26.667
Imagine, thinking no end of themselves, they are great racists.

40:27.166 --> 40:30.291
Even now, they are, but gradually they’ll definitely improve

40:30.500 --> 40:32.458
because they should know their deficiencies.

40:33.000 --> 40:37.041
This world is one and you need people from every country

40:37.250 --> 40:40.000
to help each other. But this conditioning of

40:40.250 --> 40:42.333
thinking themselves to be something great

40:42.625 --> 40:46.583
the very bad conditioning. It is a mixture of ego

40:47.041 --> 40:50.583
with conditioning, conditioning giving the ego

40:51.458 --> 40:53.417
that ‘we are the best.’

40:53.709 --> 40:57.625
But I am very happy to know that after Realisation,

40:58.375 --> 41:02.333
it so happens that this resurrection,

41:02.625 --> 41:07.625
Sahaja Yogis start thinking, understanding

41:08.291 --> 41:11.291
what is wrong in their own community,

41:12.417 --> 41:16.458
what is the mistake they have been committing.

41:17.041 --> 41:20.083
They just become like that — alert.

41:20.291 --> 41:22.083
And they start telling

41:22.208 --> 41:25.208
they are the ones who are doing this kind of nonsense.

41:25.333 --> 41:27.458
Imagine. It is very surprising

41:28.125 --> 41:32.125
how you become conscious of the defects of your own country.

41:32.417 --> 41:34.375
It is so important, is Agnya.

41:34.542 --> 41:37.583
That’s what I think Christ had realised,

41:38.041 --> 41:41.041
that Agnya should break. Unless and until Agnya breaks,

41:41.208 --> 41:45.625
people cannot go further and that’s why He crucified himself

41:46.041 --> 41:49.625
and then resurrected because without killing the Agnya,

41:50.083 --> 41:51.500
you cannot resurrect.

41:52.375 --> 41:56.250
All these things have worked out so well now

41:56.667 --> 42:01.417
that the whole world is seeing you like a panoramic view,

42:02.125 --> 42:06.166
of complete destruction of the nonsense.

42:07.625 --> 42:09.625
They are seeing this very clearly

42:10.041 --> 42:13.083
and you see now these people who would not even look at us,

42:14.208 --> 42:19.583
who had a very stiff nose and stiff lips and stiff neck

42:20.291 --> 42:25.041
— all is relaxed. They are wondering why this is happening.

42:25.583 --> 42:27.583
‘From when did we get this curse?’

42:28.417 --> 42:30.417
So for the Europeans specially,

42:31.291 --> 42:34.375
they have to understand the beauty

42:35.000 --> 42:38.417
and the love and the greatness of other human beings

42:39.250 --> 42:43.208
and then that will so much satisfy them.

42:44.041 --> 42:48.709
Why there is so much problem now of this recession, how it is come.

42:49.458 --> 42:53.166
Recession is nothing. It is the same Mr. Ego.

42:53.583 --> 42:59.583
It is the same conditioning, which was like a snake was eating up.

43:00.291 --> 43:02.333
Now it has receded. It is full.

43:03.291 --> 43:05.333
It doesn’t need any more. It’s quite full.

43:05.667 --> 43:11.458
And maybe it is now in danger of getting indigestion, I think.

43:12.125 --> 43:16.291
So that these two snakes that were eating human beings are receded.

43:17.667 --> 43:21.083
It’s the best time where you can see the drama.

43:21.625 --> 43:25.583
Drama of ego and your conditioning.

43:26.166 --> 43:29.542
How these two things have eaten up human beings.

43:30.250 --> 43:32.250
One should feel shy.

43:32.583 --> 43:36.542
One should feel a little bit modest about it.

43:37.375 --> 43:41.458
When you are full of ego, you don’t even see anything.

43:42.333 --> 43:47.417
Or putting a conditioning on others, it’s horrible, I tell you.

43:48.041 --> 43:51.375
I can’t understand how can they put a conditioning on others.

43:53.417 --> 43:58.417
It is now, you people all enjoy, say, for Indian music.

43:59.208 --> 44:01.041
But when the British were ruling us,

44:01.250 --> 44:04.250
they used to think it was a horrible noise going on.

44:05.625 --> 44:07.583
They could never understand.

44:08.083 --> 44:12.083
Now they are paying such a lot to attend the program for music.

44:12.709 --> 44:15.709
That is also a kind of a rebuff, but

44:16.250 --> 44:19.417
also they don’t understand. Still they will go

44:20.000 --> 44:24.041
because it’s regarded as a very big fashion

44:24.667 --> 44:26.458
to listen to Indian music.

44:27.041 --> 44:31.250
So it is your ego also is so stupid

44:31.458 --> 44:33.500
that God knows when it will give in.

44:34.125 --> 44:36.458
Today it will say, ‘This is the best thing.’

44:36.625 --> 44:38.417
Tomorrow it will say, 'No, no, no, no.

44:38.542 --> 44:40.625
We should take the other one. That’s much better.’

44:41.291 --> 44:44.291
In this, I see, they have no discrimination.

44:44.583 --> 44:47.583
Basically, people have no discrimination.

44:48.291 --> 44:51.250
Those who have ego are indiscriminate.

44:51.709 --> 44:55.583
They cannot discriminate between evil and good.

44:56.041 --> 44:59.000
And such people have been now,

44:59.458 --> 45:02.417
thank God, have been punished quite a lot.

45:02.625 --> 45:06.542
But it is the life of Christ, His model,

45:07.083 --> 45:13.458
proves that your resurrection is so essential,

45:13.709 --> 45:19.500
which is so innate, that unless and until you get it, you are lost.

45:20.250 --> 45:23.500
Whether it’s a country, whether it’s a person

45:24.000 --> 45:27.709
or any organisation. This ego that you have

45:28.208 --> 45:31.083
can ruin, ultimately, is now been proved,

45:32.166 --> 45:35.250
can completely take you away from reality.

45:36.208 --> 45:38.250
That is the thing that blinds you,

45:39.166 --> 45:41.417
which can — another ego can blind you also.

45:42.125 --> 45:44.625
Like we have those priests, we have those mullahs

45:45.041 --> 45:48.375
and all these people. They are the ones who have this

45:50.125 --> 45:54.125
tremendous power to misguide

45:54.625 --> 45:58.625
you because your ego has no discretion sense.

45:59.208 --> 46:01.250
It doesn’t even think like that.

46:02.208 --> 46:04.250
And when they are specially,

46:04.500 --> 46:07.500
not so much on the ego side, but on the conditioning side,

46:08.041 --> 46:10.625
it’s even much worse – much worse.

46:11.542 --> 46:14.250
Because when you are conditioned,

46:14.458 --> 46:17.208
you start believing into all kinds of nonsense.

46:17.542 --> 46:20.166
And you start ruining your health with that.

46:20.500 --> 46:25.625
It is a very, very surprising thing how people understand

46:26.250 --> 46:29.291
and like things which are very destructive.

46:30.709 --> 46:32.291
But you can manage.

46:32.458 --> 46:35.500
These are the modern times, where you can advertise,

46:36.041 --> 46:38.667
you can do all kinds of enticement, everything

46:39.166 --> 46:42.166
and you can manage this Mr. Ego very well,

46:42.583 --> 46:45.625
which pampers you. In this pampering,

46:46.083 --> 46:50.083
ego gets completely drowned and

46:50.333 --> 46:53.375
it loses its control over its own personality.

46:54.125 --> 46:56.291
Thus, many by people get lost into it.

46:57.458 --> 46:59.709
Now Christ has sacrificed His life

47:00.375 --> 47:02.291
and then He resurrected.

47:02.667 --> 47:04.709
In the same way, all such people

47:05.166 --> 47:08.166
who have ruined their lives have to come up

47:09.250 --> 47:13.125
through resurrection. there’s no other way out  through Sahaja Yoga.

47:13.500 --> 47:18.291
When you understand your own value, you’ll understand everything.

47:19.333 --> 47:22.083
Otherwise, what is it? You are looking through your eyes

47:22.250 --> 47:24.125
or somebody else’s eyes?

47:24.333 --> 47:27.333
You’re hearing through your ears or somebody else’s ear?

47:28.583 --> 47:32.208
It should be your own, so know thyself.

47:33.208 --> 47:36.667
When you know thyself, everything will work out very well.

47:37.625 --> 47:42.333
Out of this only, out of this category of people who know themselves

47:42.542 --> 47:44.583
Sahaja Yoga can be built up —

47:45.041 --> 47:47.583
not by people who do not know themselves.

47:49.041 --> 47:54.083
It’s a very, very long subject. I could go on on these two subjects,

47:54.291 --> 47:57.333
but the main thing is we have to be thankful

47:57.625 --> 48:03.083
to Christ for bringing this resurrection

48:03.333 --> 48:06.458
into play so that we get our discretion.

48:07.333 --> 48:09.333
Divine discretion, we’ll get it.

48:09.542 --> 48:14.583
It’s such a struggle, such a path He created,

48:15.083 --> 48:20.542
that we could go through this ordeal very easily,

48:21.458 --> 48:25.417
which will kill our ego and our conditioning.

48:27.208 --> 48:30.041
I am happy Sahaja Yogis will realise it

48:30.417 --> 48:33.125
and respect it within yourself,

48:33.333 --> 48:37.291
that you are seeing your ego and superego

48:37.583 --> 48:40.583
so clearly and that you could be above it.

48:42.125 --> 48:44.166
May God bless you all.
