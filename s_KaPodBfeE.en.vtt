00:09.933 --> 00:13.254
So, once you start going to the subtler side

00:13.334 --> 00:18.455
of the physical things – not only aesthetics

00:18.535 --> 00:22.571
aesthetics are also saleable –

00:24.044 --> 00:30.281
but things that cannot be sold: you cannot sell your spirit.

00:31.307 --> 00:36.749
They should be the most precious things for you,

00:37.556 --> 00:41.553
which is the most precious energy for you.

00:42.546 --> 00:46.116
Our values are changed. We are different people.

00:47.576 --> 00:50.781
Which is the most precious energy for us?

00:50.861 --> 00:54.122
Is the living energy.

00:54.936 --> 01:00.654
The synthesized energy of all the energies
is the living energy.

01:00.734 --> 01:06.494
But we believe in money energy or destructive energies

01:06.574 --> 01:12.897
or atomic energies, electrical energies, now petrol energies

01:12.977 --> 01:16.497
and all these points will be hit,

01:16.577 --> 01:20.858
to understand that you have to do without them.

01:22.208 --> 01:31.616
So, the greatest thing for a Sahaja yogi
is the living energy,

01:32.196 --> 01:36.621
and the sign of living energy is that it grows

01:36.701 --> 01:40.456
and discards all that is useless for it.

01:41.790 --> 01:45.056
It knows how to work it out.

01:45.160 --> 01:49.821
In the same way, a Sahaja yogi
should know what is important,

01:49.901 --> 01:56.584
what is unimportant. You are judged every moment, naturally,

01:56.664 --> 02:02.214
because you have entered into the judgment of God.

02:08.965 --> 02:16.987
This understanding of becoming subtler comes through love.

02:25.005 --> 02:34.658
What is love, is hard to describe. You can only enjoy it.

02:34.738 --> 02:39.638
I enjoy it, when a villager brings something so simple,

02:39.718 --> 02:42.151
and makes Me eat that.

02:43.316 --> 02:50.753
Like the small little fruits called ber
were given to Shri Rama.

02:51.145 --> 02:55.478
Shri Rama Himself was born on the right side.

02:55.604 --> 02:58.252
Great example for all of you is Shri Ram

02:58.332 --> 03:03.031
who was on the right side, who works the right side.

03:03.111 --> 03:08.266
When He was born and He was a child… He is a Suryavanshi,

03:08.346 --> 03:12.841
He is the son of Surya. I mean Surya,

03:12.921 --> 03:16.307
everything comes from the Sun to Him.

03:16.661 --> 03:20.576
When He was born and was a little child,

03:20.656 --> 03:26.332
He asked His mother that “I would like to have the Moon.”

03:26.413 --> 03:31.219
He started crying, and nobody knew how to satisfy.

03:31.300 --> 03:33.915
He said “I want to have the Moon.”

03:34.275 --> 03:36.685
They gave him any toys – he’d throw away.

03:36.765 --> 03:40.251
They said, “What a child it is, funny thing…

03:40.331 --> 03:46.189
He wants to have the moon, now how to get Him the moon?”

03:48.849 --> 03:50.985
They did not know how to solve the problem.

03:51.066 --> 03:52.818
He said, “Somehow you get Me the moon.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.545
I don’t want to eat or anything, I want to have the moon.”

03:55.625 --> 04:01.709
Here the moon represents the Atma, the cooling capacity.

04:03.722 --> 04:05.961
He asked for the moon.

04:07.069 --> 04:12.188
You are all on the right side, so ask for the moon.

04:12.540 --> 04:15.069
Ask for the Spirit.

04:15.149 --> 04:17.757
And they didn’t know how to satisfy this Shri Rama,

04:17.837 --> 04:21.628
who was the incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

04:22.658 --> 04:28.776
asking for the moon of all the things,
not for anything else.

04:28.856 --> 04:31.461
What is so important?

04:31.542 --> 04:38.554
So, the mother has always a intuition.

04:38.634 --> 04:43.290
She brought a… it’s a, it’s a maya, it is a beautiful drama.

04:43.370 --> 04:46.914
She brought a mirror and showed Him the moon in the mirror.

04:46.995 --> 04:50.256
He said, “Now you can get the moon here.”

04:51.654 --> 04:56.755
So sweet! And He was satisfied.

04:57.061 --> 05:00.690
Even the reflection of that can satisfy.

05:00.975 --> 05:02.735
You are like the mirrors

05:02.816 --> 05:07.933
and I want to see the reflection of moon in you.

05:10.866 --> 05:17.276
The love we talk of, is to be subtler.

05:19.866 --> 05:25.103
It becomes really subtler when you really enjoy.

05:28.036 --> 05:31.691
Like giving something to someone

05:33.898 --> 05:36.439
is one of the ways of judging it.

05:36.519 --> 05:39.244
When you start to enjoy giving

05:39.324 --> 05:44.144
– not taking, just giving –

05:44.377 --> 05:48.413
then you should know on material level you have felt,

05:48.526 --> 05:51.293
you have touched that shore of subtlety

05:51.373 --> 05:53.864
on material level only.

05:57.143 --> 06:02.934
On emotional level you can

06:03.014 --> 06:05.703
– in India, I mean, everybody loves their children,

06:05.783 --> 06:08.547
I mean it’s a bit too much, going too far.

06:08.628 --> 06:10.668
I mean, they can even sell their country

06:10.748 --> 06:13.822
in the name of their children.
It is going too far,

06:13.902 --> 06:18.657
their wives – I mean, it is a trip – their husbands,

06:18.738 --> 06:23.292
is a bit too much. The other side is in the West,

06:23.372 --> 06:28.612
where they don’t believe in all this nonsensical love.

06:30.338 --> 06:35.888
In between, the subtlety of love is that:

06:35.968 --> 06:48.019
love a person, not with any reasoning, with any way of gain

06:48.099 --> 06:56.571
or any relationship whatsoever, just emit love.

07:00.428 --> 07:04.256
Whether you are recognized or not,

07:04.643 --> 07:08.961
just emit love is the subtler way of loving.

07:09.041 --> 07:12.543
That love cures people,

07:16.464 --> 07:20.231
that love comforts

07:20.851 --> 07:24.439
– that’s the comforting side, it comforts.

07:24.538 --> 07:27.711
To begin with, we should see to the comforts of others.

07:28.390 --> 07:32.016
Self-indulgence is against that love.
