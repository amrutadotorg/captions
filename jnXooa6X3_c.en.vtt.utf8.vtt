00:01:21.990 --> 00:04:57.050
Today we 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:09.390
have gathered here to do the Kundalini Puja
or the Adishakti Puja.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:18.300
There's a difference between the two.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:42.210
Adishakti is the total power of God, of His
desire; while Kundalini 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:06:00.710
is the one that is reflected, part, which
is reflected in the human beings as Kundalini.

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:07.790
So there's a difference between the Adi Kundalini
and the Adishakti.

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:26.590
Adishakti is the Parashakti, is the power,
which is beyond all the powers, which controls

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:45.259
all the powers and one of the powers of Adishakti
is Kundalini.

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:56.710
For example the Kundalini which is placed
within Me in the triangular bone is not totality

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:59.699
of Me.

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:07.780
In the same way the Kundalini, which is placed
within you, is not the totality.

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:17.809
Of course it is the power, which is there
to give you your self-realization.

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:30.050
Is the power that redeems you, that nourishes
you, that enlightens your centers.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:39.559
But there are two other powers as you know
very powerful, which are working through Ida

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:51.710
and Pingala and the third one is Mahalakshmi
which is in the center.

00:07:51.710 --> 00:08:10.389
Now Kundalini's main job is to give you your
self-realization because She is your individual

00:08:10.389 --> 00:08:13.340
Mother.

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:23.580
Everyone has the Kundalini within himself
or herself reflected whatever maybe the quality

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:29.090
of that person.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.110
Now as you see reflections fall on everything.

00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:40.990
Say, the reflection of the Moon falls on the
stone; you don't see any reflection.

00:08:40.990 --> 00:08:53.490
It then falls on a better reflector - say
the water, then we can see the reflection.

00:08:53.490 --> 00:09:06.980
But when it falls on a mirror, which is very
nicely made, say in Belgium, it reflects better.

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:12.820
So that is how the reflection gradually goes
on improving.

00:09:12.820 --> 00:09:24.779
In the same way we have human beings who have
different reflectors but they can be improved

00:09:24.779 --> 00:09:32.060
and they can be made absolutely top class,
its possible.

00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:38.210
It depends now here it comes into other powers
that are within.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:43.880
One power which is the desire.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:51.680
Though the Kundalini as you see is the power
of pure desire that it doesn't want anything.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:56.430
But it wants to give you self-realization.

00:09:56.430 --> 00:10:05.880
The other two powers - one of them is the
mundane desire.

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:17.170
This mundane desire if it becomes nothing
but pure desire, then Kundalini has no problems

00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:21.149
from the left side.

00:10:21.149 --> 00:10:34.880
But if it is not a pure desire, but full of
other desires - for example: the first desire

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:43.130
of human beings, which comes from animals
I think, is food.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.610
He wants food to nourish himself.

00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:56.740
But human being don't only take food to nourish,
also for the taste of it, or for the beauty

00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:03.710
of it, which is innately working in them.

00:11:03.710 --> 00:11:22.240
That's why we run after food, which is very
good, very tasty, all kinds of ideas we have

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:25.490
and there's no standard.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:35.769
Somebody can like this, somebody can like
that, but the one who understands that the

00:11:35.769 --> 00:11:49.810
taste of the food is not important and can
practice it, then it works.

00:11:49.810 --> 00:12:11.300
It works wonders because the lowest desire,
which is of food, comes under your control.

00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:20.420
If you can sometimes go without food, of course
not for God but for yourself, God doesn't

00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:22.870
want you to starve.

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:39.000
If you can live without food, if you can enjoy
every type of food, then you have done a lot

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.579
to improve the path of Shushumna for the Kundalini.

00:12:47.579 --> 00:13:01.060
I've seen in many cases that Kundalini just
doesn't rise, She doesn't rise, even if She

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:05.480
rises, She falls back.

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:17.630
This happens when a person is very self-indulgent
- is all the time thinking of things, which

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:25.459
are not of very great importance for Spirituality.

00:13:25.459 --> 00:13:42.550
Apart from this there's another horrible one
desire we have is to grab as much money as

00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:47.269
possible, to think about money.

00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:53.870
This time I had a bad experience because Sahaja
Yogis came down to Me and told Me, "Mother

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:59.630
they are asking if I, if we should reduce
the puja money or something?"

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:03.199
I was shocked because I never decide about
it.

00:14:03.199 --> 00:14:05.589
It's all decided by the leaders.

00:14:05.589 --> 00:14:07.860
I said, "I am not concerned."

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:17.820
Then they would like to have a bargain as
you have in the shop you see or maybe some

00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:21.110
sort of a sale or some sort of a thing.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:27.949
This is one of the greatest dangers in your
ascent.

00:14:27.949 --> 00:14:31.129
For a guru people pay millions and millions.

00:14:31.129 --> 00:14:36.670
Where you know I am working it out for your
projects, I am buying lands for you, I am

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:41.350
doing things for you and for which you need
money.

00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:48.480
But nobody comes forward with any donations
as such.

00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:56.129
They won't, they don't understand that it
is for you I have to have all these things

00:14:56.129 --> 00:15:04.990
not for Me and they pestered people many a
times like this.

00:15:04.990 --> 00:15:10.980
Once suddenly they decided that we could have
fifty percent payment.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:16.570
Immediately so many telephone - "Ah are you
going to have fifty percent less the bargain

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.570
price?

00:15:17.570 --> 00:15:20.259
We are coming for the bargain".

00:15:20.259 --> 00:15:23.680
Is the sale programming.

00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.389
For example in the sale what do they do?

00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:41.389
They offer you something, so that they can
get a lot more customers or things like that.

00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:45.750
Sahaja yoga is just the opposite of that.

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:50.370
You don't have to give anything but you get
lot.

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:57.060
But this is not for sale; this is not for
sale by any chance.

00:15:57.060 --> 00:16:05.061
It is a thing where you have to pay because
we have to have all these things and I have

00:16:05.061 --> 00:16:11.180
to pay so many things which you do not know
- like last time we had about I think fifty

00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:16.910
people who came just free.

00:16:16.910 --> 00:16:18.350
Some of the leaders know.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:25.949
But some of the leaders, they just go on asking
like this because I don't know perhaps they

00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:31.820
want to save money or they want to popularize
themselves among the disciples maybe, that

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:37.579
is the reason.

00:16:37.579 --> 00:16:48.660
So this thinking about money itself is a very
detrimental force for your spirituality.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.800
Otherwise what others are doing is the same.

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:55.769
All the time they are thinking of money, thinking
of money.

00:16:55.769 --> 00:17:04.520
Now if you are thinking of money and thinking
of earning more, for Sahaja Yoga to help Sahaja

00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:07.270
Yoga it's all right.

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.290
But it is for yours own ideas.

00:17:09.290 --> 00:17:13.120
In the West it's very common.

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:21.750
Not in India I must tell you, we; India is
the poor country but one day Yogi told Me,

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:25.180
"Mother I need some money for the school".

00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:27.320
I said, "All right I'll give you".

00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:29.150
"No, no", he said, "I'll collect".

00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:32.470
And he collected in one meeting eighteen lakhs
of Rupees.

00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:40.790
Of course I told him, "Now don't take it,
I've got money to pay, don't collect".

00:17:40.790 --> 00:17:45.600
But so much of money orientation all the time.

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:56.620
Thinking about money, saving money, these
things are absolutely against Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:56.620 --> 00:17:59.390
You can ask anyone how much I understand about
money.

00:17:59.390 --> 00:18:06.340
I don't understand banking, I cannot count,
even thousand pounds I cannot count.

00:18:06.340 --> 00:18:10.690
I'll count them two thousand or three thousand;
I don't know what I do?

00:18:10.690 --> 00:18:15.020
My brain goes off when it comes to money.

00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:16.020
I don't know how to count.

00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:22.150
I am not worried about what money we have,
what we have, what we have to do is this money

00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:30.059
is here let us do something about it.

00:18:30.059 --> 00:18:35.270
Today I don't know why I have to tell about
this gross subject.

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:40.490
But it has been pointed out to Me, "Mother
you never say anything about it and the people

00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:44.100
are getting really materialistic".

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.820
That's a very sad affair.

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:52.740
Even one person, who is materialistic, will
have to go out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:52.740 --> 00:19:05.470
Gradually it will work that way and you'll
be surprised that you are out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:16.470
It is very amazing how after getting realization
also, getting on top of the world, we still

00:19:16.470 --> 00:19:26.919
live in small little holes like rats of this
money business.

00:19:26.919 --> 00:19:38.309
This money has brought so much problems to
our world, you can see it clearly.

00:19:38.309 --> 00:19:45.159
All this Economics and all this knowledge
of Economics where it has gone?

00:19:45.159 --> 00:19:47.919
Is the world better by it?

00:19:47.919 --> 00:19:54.720
There's recession going on everywhere, everybody
is unemployed.

00:19:54.720 --> 00:20:00.030
In every country you go there's unemployment
so much; this is so much.

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:09.510
That shows that this Economics is also a very
artificial science and dealing with the weakness

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:15.660
of human being, not with their strength.

00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:23.950
If they could know the strength of human beings,
they would have done much better than they

00:20:23.950 --> 00:20:28.470
have done so far.

00:20:28.470 --> 00:20:41.929
I'll give a simple example: Now, we have very
sophisticated places in the West, very sophisticated.

00:20:41.929 --> 00:20:50.539
You know they have everything electrical,
you push the button and everything is there.

00:20:50.539 --> 00:20:55.020
Specially in these modern planes when I travel,
I don't know which one to push because they

00:20:55.020 --> 00:21:04.679
are so slim and so delicate you see, need
a special artist to do that.

00:21:04.679 --> 00:21:11.559
All this is for what for getting more money,
and more money and impressing people.

00:21:11.559 --> 00:21:18.990
But at the same time people are fed up; when
all these sophistications are on.

00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:23.850
They are fed up with computers, they are fed
up with electricity, they are fed up with

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:29.450
cement, they are fed up all kinds of artificial
thing, is a fact.

00:21:29.450 --> 00:21:35.640
More, more, much more in the West than in
the developing countries.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:37.460
They are just fed up.

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:44.100
Now this is the force, this is the strength.

00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.510
Why are they fed up?

00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:55.870
They are fed up because they have realized
it doesn't give you joy.

00:21:55.870 --> 00:21:59.399
It doesn't give you soothing feeling.

00:21:59.399 --> 00:22:03.110
It irritates them.

00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:17.600
So it is against human mind, human character
or human civilization, something inhuman.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:19.080
So now what to do?

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:28.940
I went to America once, and went to see a
friend of ours and all the houses were covered

00:22:28.940 --> 00:22:32.770
with the cow dung color you see.

00:22:32.770 --> 00:22:39.440
I said, "Why do they have these cow dung all
over these houses you know?

00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.510
What is the matter with them?

00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:46.029
Why don't they have nice white or another
people like very much is this sand color?

00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:51.690
He said, "Now a days these Americans want
to have cow dung."

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.049
I said, "Cow dung!

00:22:54.049 --> 00:22:55.230
For what?"

00:22:55.230 --> 00:22:57.440
"Because they are fed up of cement.

00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.770
Now they can't get so much cow dung here.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:10.700
So they have a special way of making cement
look like cow dung.

00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:16.909
They mix up things so the color comes out
like cow dung".

00:23:16.909 --> 00:23:21.789
I said, "Why the cow dung of all the things
you see?"

00:23:21.789 --> 00:23:28.970
So they said that some of them went to India
and they had to sleep in some huts, which

00:23:28.970 --> 00:23:32.340
were covered with cow dung.

00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:41.630
So they found out logically that cow dung
if we have, it will be the most soothing color

00:23:41.630 --> 00:23:43.720
for us.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:50.750
And so there were articles about it and people
have started using cow dung.

00:23:50.750 --> 00:23:54.150
So what is the force now behind?

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.049
What is the strength?

00:23:56.049 --> 00:24:05.860
The strength is that they want to live in
natural way; they don't want to have artificial

00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:08.670
things.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:12.429
So they go to another extreme to have cow
dung.

00:24:12.429 --> 00:24:18.169
Sahaja Yoga is in between.

00:24:18.169 --> 00:24:25.789
Now one has to understand that whether you
put cow dung or you put cement or anything,

00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:29.590
it's not going to give you joy.

00:24:29.590 --> 00:24:42.920
Say for India people who have got cement houses
are great, you know?

00:24:42.920 --> 00:24:50.510
According to them cement represents luxury
and also rank.

00:24:50.510 --> 00:25:01.580
But in the West if people see cement, my goodness,
cement means to them it is something like

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:02.580
a grave.

00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:11.760
So now the positive thing that is in with
them is that they now want to live with a

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.460
natural things.

00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.490
They want to use natural material.

00:25:17.490 --> 00:25:19.500
Natural life.

00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:30.230
But to the extreme if they go you see we had
anti culture like hippyism and all that.

00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:33.269
It brought no luck.

00:25:33.269 --> 00:25:47.540
So to get from one end to another extreme
it also not conducive to a human life because;

00:25:47.540 --> 00:25:53.130
and you see a human being cannot become primitive.

00:25:53.130 --> 00:25:59.070
Even if he tries to dress up like a primitive
person his brain is modern.

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:08.779
So when they get fed up from one to another,
they don't realize that what is the missing

00:26:08.779 --> 00:26:12.309
point?

00:26:12.309 --> 00:26:23.049
In both the things whether you live like a
rustic person or a very cementy person, any

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:35.559
type you might live, the missing point is
that in everything there is a competition.

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:43.620
Once it starts the fashion all right everybody
will have cane chairs; everybody is having

00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:45.590
cane chairs.

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:54.679
Now in this competition, they miss the point
is the joy.

00:26:54.679 --> 00:27:05.620
A person who is a realized soul will not desire
whether it is cement or anything or anything

00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:10.470
doesn't matter its just the same.

00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:20.919
But it will come to his mind that all these
artificial things are ruining human beings.

00:27:20.919 --> 00:27:23.899
So he'll say no.

00:27:23.899 --> 00:27:35.690
But he will not have hair like the primitive
people; he'll not behave like primitive people

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:42.580
and lead a very normal, natural life.

00:27:42.580 --> 00:27:48.549
So when the mind starts thinking something
about it, it will never get to the point of

00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:54.880
joy, from one end to another.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:02.970
So they think that they are going into a balance,
they are going into dharma.

00:28:02.970 --> 00:28:07.450
My experience is different.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:13.970
Even those who were hippies I know them, they
used to eat like real gluttons and they are

00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:20.860
very much interested in their comforts and
they would go to any extent of snatching anything

00:28:20.860 --> 00:28:22.860
of that belongs to somebody else.

00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:30.480
They thought they now become hippies so they're
already the landlords, because they have given

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:34.320
up this, they have given up that.

00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:44.940
So the mind that suggest that to overcome
your money orientation, your competition and

00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:51.750
all these artificial things you should change
your life style.

00:28:51.750 --> 00:28:56.460
But that doesn't help, never.

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:05.280
It's just a play of the mind from one to another.

00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:14.429
So how to detach yourself from this idea of
money orientation?

00:29:14.429 --> 00:29:26.450
Whether you wear a sanyasi's dress or you
wear a wonderful - some very expensive dress,

00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:30.639
is the same to the body.

00:29:30.639 --> 00:29:33.669
You can't even see your own dress.

00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:39.730
So is the same to the eyes.

00:29:39.730 --> 00:29:49.779
But with the mind you start convincing yourself
that now I've become a big sanyasi because

00:29:49.779 --> 00:29:54.960
I am wearing a saffron dress.

00:29:54.960 --> 00:30:02.110
By wearing that kind of a dress you can never
get rid of this nonsense.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:05.110
So first thing you have to be a normal person.

00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:10.020
There is no need to be abnormal outside.

00:30:10.020 --> 00:30:23.360
That you are deceiving yourself.

00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:32.320
If you think by changing your dress, attire,
your lifestyle you have become a great sanyasi

00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:39.380
or a great, detached person from this money
orientation then I must say, 'don't deceive

00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:42.070
yourself'.

00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:59.570
A person who is detached from within helps
the Kundalini to rise constantly without any

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:04.850
catches.

00:31:04.850 --> 00:31:16.960
So for a Sahaja Yogi it is important to introspect
and see for himself what is your level?

00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:25.779
As I told you about the reflector what sort
of a reflector you are?

00:31:25.779 --> 00:31:32.529
No use deceiving yourself because Sahaja Yoga
is for you, for your benevolence and your

00:31:32.529 --> 00:31:37.850
Kundalini is for your benevolence.

00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:48.490
The ascent is the aim of your life and to
perfect it is your job.

00:31:48.490 --> 00:31:58.039
So you don't have to take to anything outside.

00:31:58.039 --> 00:32:08.870
It is inside you have to see yourself what
sort of attachments you have.

00:32:08.870 --> 00:32:18.080
The second force which is, I am surprised
how has suddenly come up among Sahaja Yogis

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:21.140
that they don't have immorality problems.

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:25.160
They have just become moral, most of them.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:30.820
Ninety-nine point nine, nine, nine, I think
are moral people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:38.480
There may be here and there because they enjoy
their morality.

00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:44.860
Because they enjoy their morality they want
to be that.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:50.010
Not only that they want their children to
be moral, their families to be moral.

00:32:50.010 --> 00:32:56.140
And that is how morality is spreading in Sahaja
Yoga very fast.

00:32:56.140 --> 00:33:05.360
In that also one has to understand that it
is the innocence, which is the force.

00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:11.210
Not the morality like some people write to
Me, "Mother I get up in the morning, I sit

00:33:11.210 --> 00:33:17.850
before the photograph, I do this, I do that,
then I take my bath and then I do this."

00:33:17.850 --> 00:33:24.919
I don't, I cant understand this, no not necessary.

00:33:24.919 --> 00:33:31.909
You have to cleanse yourself once in the night
as you cleanse yourself - your body.

00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:37.299
And once in the morning you have to pray,
that's all.

00:33:37.299 --> 00:33:42.190
Is not necessary to have this ritualism, this
kind of a rigmarole.

00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:45.940
Oh all the time you go in.

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:53.259
Everyday morning till evening nonsensical
these things and they become fanatic.

00:33:53.259 --> 00:33:59.980
They start becoming absolutely fanatic about
Sahaja yoga and this fanaticism can be very

00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:09.120
dangerous because they try to remember everything
by heart this and that.

00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:12.000
No, not necessary.

00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:19.100
It should be in the heart because it amounts
to the lip service there and with the lip

00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:25.220
service gradually you start feeling you are
great, your father is great, you this and

00:34:25.220 --> 00:34:26.220
that.

00:34:26.220 --> 00:34:28.260
So you are thrown away.

00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:34.409
You yourself throw yourself out like a, I
can say like a - you hit a ball and it comes

00:34:34.409 --> 00:34:40.639
back like, I've seen people - many who try
to thrust themselves in Sahaja Yoga just are

00:34:40.639 --> 00:34:46.230
repelled back by themselves, not by Sahaja
Yoga.

00:34:46.230 --> 00:34:50.429
Sahaja Yoga attracts you, no doubt.

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.740
But you must have gravity.

00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:58.660
If you don't have gravity how can you be attracted?

00:34:58.660 --> 00:35:07.390
The seriousness about it is only this - that
you should introspect, seriously.

00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:10.410
Find out what's wrong with you.

00:35:10.410 --> 00:35:14.890
Because this is a great chance for you to
ascend.

00:35:14.890 --> 00:35:25.230
With this kind of a mind, which becomes fanatic
in Sahaja Yoga, starts saying harsh things

00:35:25.230 --> 00:35:39.400
to other and disturbing the peace of others
because they think they are very great Sahaja

00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.720
Yogis.

00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:48.460
Then I think one should introspect and find
out why am I doing it?

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:53.790
So many people have the same defects but for
that they'll scold others.

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:57.220
Perhaps maybe they think by correcting another
person they might be corrected.

00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:01.369
I don't know what is the idea of their procedure
is?

00:36:01.369 --> 00:36:12.010
But it is very absurd sometimes; the way people
look at their, look at their problems as if

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.010
these are the problems of others.

00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:20.430
Now, if I am saying this to you somebody must
be counting - "Ah I know this one Mother is

00:36:20.430 --> 00:36:21.970
saying about that one".

00:36:21.970 --> 00:36:29.510
Never will say that it's for me and I have
to see myself and introspect and find out

00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:36.290
what is dragging me down.

00:36:36.290 --> 00:36:43.420
So this is one of the most important things
is that you cannot be harsh, you cannot hurt

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:50.339
people, you cannot misbehave in that manner,
and if you can't do that then you are thrown

00:36:50.339 --> 00:36:55.940
out of Sahaja Yoga by yourself, nobody has
to throw you.

00:36:55.940 --> 00:37:02.280
You have to correct you, people have to like
you and you have to be one of them.

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:08.030
If the collectivity is not there, your Kundalini
will never rise.

00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:14.400
Because She's rising, She's trying to give
you a second birth so that you become one

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.060
with the whole.

00:37:16.060 --> 00:37:17.579
The drop becomes the ocean.

00:37:17.579 --> 00:37:20.069
That's Her job, She'll never rise.

00:37:20.069 --> 00:37:29.400
A person who thinks he's very exclusive, special
should not come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:39.530
This is another great hurdle in raising the
Kundalini when people think that they are

00:37:39.530 --> 00:37:42.310
something special.

00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:47.930
We have no priesthood.

00:37:47.930 --> 00:37:57.950
And leadership is also is a myth I think,
people whom I think are better off with their

00:37:57.950 --> 00:38:02.160
Kundalini I can communicate better.

00:38:02.160 --> 00:38:06.390
But sometimes they too behave in such a manner
that one is shocked.

00:38:06.390 --> 00:38:09.730
How could they behave like this?

00:38:09.730 --> 00:38:14.690
And these serpents you see just suddenly come
up and you see them.

00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:20.460
You are shocked what are they doing, where
is their attention?

00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:27.990
What are they worried about?

00:38:27.990 --> 00:38:34.650
So such stupid ideas if they walk into your
mind tell them, shut up now I know myself

00:38:34.650 --> 00:38:35.650
very well.

00:38:35.650 --> 00:38:42.060
That's the best way to keep you out of it
all these nonsensical things that are working.

00:38:42.060 --> 00:38:46.710
First of all you must remember that you are
seekers of truth.

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:55.330
Have been seeking truth for ages, for years
together and now, I would say for many lives

00:38:55.330 --> 00:38:56.990
and now you have found it.

00:38:56.990 --> 00:39:09.140
So grab it and hold it fast by understanding
that this is what you wanted you've got it

00:39:09.140 --> 00:39:11.060
now.

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:18.181
The another big problem that comes in the
awakening of the Kundalini which I feel is

00:39:18.181 --> 00:39:25.900
very important to be told to you is that some
of you think that you are very close to Me.

00:39:25.900 --> 00:39:34.810
That you have a special right on Me.

00:39:34.810 --> 00:39:39.310
You don't know your Mother is a Mahamaya,
be careful.

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:43.200
I am telling you again and again.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.859
Never think that way.

00:39:46.859 --> 00:39:52.520
Nobody can be My favorite, I assure you, cannot
be.

00:39:52.520 --> 00:40:05.069
It is like a mercury if you put it on another
metal or something doesn't stick you know.

00:40:05.069 --> 00:40:09.510
My mind never sticks to anyone, never sticks.

00:40:09.510 --> 00:40:14.970
Now supposing somebody is in trouble, somebody
has written to Me, there's some problem, then

00:40:14.970 --> 00:40:18.250
the thought comes in.

00:40:18.250 --> 00:40:29.160
But I don't stick to that, I don't stick to
anyone nor do I have any attachment to anyone

00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:33.069
because that will be against the principle
of pure love.

00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:38.970
I cannot be attached, of course I see your
problems very intimately.

00:40:38.970 --> 00:40:49.230
I would love to solve them, I get worried
sometimes, you can call it worried, but the

00:40:49.230 --> 00:40:55.839
thought - attention is going towards that
person.

00:40:55.839 --> 00:41:09.770
You've seen when there's a tide, the Moon
when it is full Moon the tide is much bigger.

00:41:09.770 --> 00:41:19.859
Does the ocean think what about the Moon?

00:41:19.859 --> 00:41:29.630
Does he think that it has to attract the particular
ocean or someone?

00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:35.400
It's just the nature - the swabhava, the nature
itself that acts.

00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:48.440
That's the nature, you can't help it and this
nature is the one you should also try to adopt

00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.559
and adore because it's very helpful.

00:41:53.559 --> 00:42:01.980
This gives you a great relief from your mind,
which is always thinking, thinking, thinking

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:06.670
and doesn't allow you to have thoughtless
awareness.

00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:14.329
Get attached to someone, you are worried about
some problems, even your problems sometimes,

00:42:14.329 --> 00:42:16.400
all the time your problem.

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:22.760
Thinking about your problem or about somebody
whom you are attached to.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.650
Then this mind starts working.

00:42:24.650 --> 00:42:29.359
How to solve the problem, what to do, this
and that?

00:42:29.359 --> 00:42:36.180
But then you stop your Agnya completely, how
will the Kundalini rise?

00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:44.330
In any walk of life for a Sahaja Yogi, it
is the best way to stop thinking is to think

00:42:44.330 --> 00:42:48.220
how he's going to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:48.220 --> 00:42:52.250
Just divert your attention.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:59.579
This is the greatest pleasure for you, for
which you don't have to pay or anything; just

00:42:59.579 --> 00:43:01.790
know what powers you have got.

00:43:01.790 --> 00:43:11.109
At this point I find many people are not at
all aware of their powers and not using them.

00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:15.859
When you don't use your powers also Kundalini
falls down.

00:43:15.859 --> 00:43:19.089
Why should She work?

00:43:19.089 --> 00:43:30.530
She's not stupid; if you don't want to use
Her for what She has to achieve then why should

00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:32.880
She worry about you?

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:36.570
So She just drops down, She has nothing to
do with you.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.981
Then suddenly you come out, "Mother I got
this trouble, I've got that trouble, this

00:43:40.981 --> 00:43:42.420
happened".

00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:52.630
Especially troubles like arthritis and all
such troubles come from people who don't use

00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:54.140
their vibrations.

00:43:54.140 --> 00:44:03.020
Give it to the flowers, give it to the trees,
give it to anything that is living but don't

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:07.150
shirk it.

00:44:07.150 --> 00:44:12.810
You need not touch the person but the desire
should be 'whom should I give vibrations?'

00:44:12.810 --> 00:44:19.980
Only worry should be 'whom should I put attention
to?

00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.160
Where should I put this energy of mine?'

00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:29.900
Once you start using, this Divine Power it
starts flowing much more, much more and your

00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:36.280
Mother - the Kundalini is very happy.

00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:40.800
And then you start seeing wonders what's happening.

00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:52.020
For that you have to have first of all attention
on compassion and love; but compassion and

00:44:52.020 --> 00:44:57.260
love of God - God Almighty.

00:44:57.260 --> 00:45:03.531
But when I talk of compassion I find people
are more interested in the people who are,

00:45:03.531 --> 00:45:11.390
Sahaja Yogis who are suffering, who have problems,
who are thrown away from Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:15.930
They will write to Me, "Mother please, please
some or other take them back".

00:45:15.930 --> 00:45:19.540
That's My job not yours.

00:45:19.540 --> 00:45:30.410
But those who don't love God, they are not
going to achieve much.

00:45:30.410 --> 00:45:37.840
They have loose tongues, they talk funnily,
they don't understand they are dealing with

00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:48.350
God Almighty and this kind of frivolous talking
and frivolous behavior; you must understand

00:45:48.350 --> 00:45:54.869
that angels are around you all the time, all
the time they are with you.

00:45:54.869 --> 00:45:55.910
They watch you.

00:45:55.910 --> 00:46:07.300
They will help you, they'll support you, they'll
elevate you, they'll cross all kinds of hurdles

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:20.809
but you have to love God from all your heart
and all your soul.

00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:36.580
You can't say things, which are not full of
protocol.

00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:43.150
All this is only possible when you surrender
your ego.

00:46:43.150 --> 00:46:47.450
God doesn't want anything from you.

00:46:47.450 --> 00:46:50.290
What can you give to God?

00:46:50.290 --> 00:46:53.339
It's a funny idea people have.

00:46:53.339 --> 00:46:57.500
But its all right you can give anything to
God.

00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:06.190
Krishna has said that you can give Me flowers,
you can give Me water, you can give Me this

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:11.849
presents, this / that, I'll accept.

00:47:11.849 --> 00:47:16.440
But what does He say?

00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:29.660
That only thing that you have to do is to
be one with Me.

00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:36.150
You have to be one with Me, you have to connect,
be connected with Me.

00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:45.190
And this feeling of connection is so satisfying,
is so joy giving, so nice, which cannot be

00:47:45.190 --> 00:47:49.140
described in words.

00:47:49.140 --> 00:48:00.420
Thus you find your Kundalini is just flowing
out with joy for yourself and for others.

00:48:00.420 --> 00:48:17.090
Also the right side - ambitiousness, domination,
showing off, harshness, cruelties.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:20.819
I don't know how many things there are on
the right side.

00:48:20.819 --> 00:48:22.980
But they can be unlimited.

00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:26.410
I mean the limit is Hitler you can say, so
far.

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:33.650
God knows some other may come to compete with
him, but so far he's the last word.

00:48:33.650 --> 00:48:44.330
So all these also start destroying this Kundalini.

00:48:44.330 --> 00:48:55.460
I've seen also Kundalini of people which is
hurt, wounded, just can't rise, finished.

00:48:55.460 --> 00:49:05.930
Then I feel that let them take a second birth;
only then one can work it out because is impossible

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:11.450
for such a Kundalini to make Her rise.

00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:23.230
If you are selfish and you are cruel then
this Kundalini becomes hurt.

00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:27.640
A good mother feels hurt when her child misbehaves.

00:49:27.640 --> 00:49:36.450
So this Kundalini gets very hurt because She
wants you to have your second birth and She

00:49:36.450 --> 00:49:42.700
cant just bear it and this makes Her absolutely
incapable of rising.

00:49:42.700 --> 00:49:48.280
She becomes sick, ill and wounded.

00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:55.170
So all kinds of aggressiveness should be given
up.

00:49:55.170 --> 00:50:02.150
That's not going to help because you have
come to Sahaja Yoga not for saving money or

00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:03.640
bargaining or anything.

00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:08.540
You have come here because you are seekers.

00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:15.480
I've seen invariably people who have been
to false gurus always have this kind of a

00:50:15.480 --> 00:50:19.359
money orientation because they must have been
lynched completely by the previous gurus,

00:50:19.359 --> 00:50:25.650
maybe, I don't know what to say.

00:50:25.650 --> 00:50:34.260
So it is we who can rise through our own goodness
and beauty.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:44.860
And it is we who can come up to a level of
great Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:46.780
Don't keep this power with yourself.

00:50:46.780 --> 00:50:56.020
It is to be distributed and given to others
and make others also very happy and joyous.

00:50:56.020 --> 00:51:00.370
Is a duty of every Sahaja Yogi to do it.

00:51:00.370 --> 00:51:09.280
Also thinking about Sahaja Yoga, not about
yourself is the best way to avoid many problems.

00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:13.839
But once they start thinking about Sahaja
Yoga, they start thinking about the defects

00:51:13.839 --> 00:51:20.510
of Sahaja Yogis; that's not going to help.

00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:26.559
You have to develop that peace of mind within
yourself by which you can become the witness

00:51:26.559 --> 00:51:30.360
of yourself first.

00:51:30.360 --> 00:51:35.369
You should be able to witness yourself and
see what are the things, which are putting

00:51:35.369 --> 00:51:36.369
you down.

00:51:36.369 --> 00:51:42.450
Because today the world is absolutely chaotic,
from this chaotic world you have to rise into

00:51:42.450 --> 00:51:48.869
a very peaceful, beautiful world and you have
to take many to that.

00:51:48.869 --> 00:51:51.660
For that you have to have the quality.

00:51:51.660 --> 00:52:00.249
It's not just you become Sahaja Yogis, put
My badge here and all that.

00:52:00.249 --> 00:52:04.500
In every way you can spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:04.500 --> 00:52:10.580
But be careful because one should not feel
that you've done a great job.

00:52:10.580 --> 00:52:19.990
Whatever you are doing is for your own good
not for others.

00:52:19.990 --> 00:52:30.799
Now we have to see what a great thing that
has happened because Kundalini was a big mystery

00:52:30.799 --> 00:52:31.799
before.

00:52:31.799 --> 00:52:35.599
But now it is not anymore, it's all open.

00:52:35.599 --> 00:52:38.710
You all know about it.

00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:48.530
You know about its powers, you know how you
can achieve your highest goal.

00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:58.099
So just to balance, just to lead a mediocre
life is not the way a real true seeker of

00:52:58.099 --> 00:52:59.350
truth should do.

00:52:59.350 --> 00:53:05.390
But if you are the real seeker of truth, then
you should see what's wrong with what I've

00:53:05.390 --> 00:53:11.839
been doing, whatever I've been following and
what I have to achieve.

00:53:11.839 --> 00:53:16.430
All the scriptures have said that you have
to be the Spirit.

00:53:16.430 --> 00:53:21.180
All the scriptures had said that you have
to be born again, I am not saying that anymore.

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:30.140
Only thing what I am doing it what they have
said I am trying to do it and requesting that

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:31.140
you should do.

00:53:31.140 --> 00:53:38.190
Sahaja Yoga is not going to be like other
religions where people abuse children, do

00:53:38.190 --> 00:53:43.359
what they like, make money, this/ that, all
nonsense - like a mafia.

00:53:43.359 --> 01:02:29.760
You are people who are chosen and are special
people who believe in a good moral life and

01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:40.500
a peaceful life.

01:02:40.500 --> 01:39:36.400
May God bless you.

01:39:36.400 --> 01:58:01.810
