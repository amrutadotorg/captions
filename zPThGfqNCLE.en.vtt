00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
First, I will talk in Hindi 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.390
and then in Marathi language.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:21.010
All of you should try to learn Hindi as it is our national language.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:36.073
The name of Pune is famous in the Vedas, Puranas and many other such places.

00:00:36.073 --> 00:00:39.309
It is called as Punyapatnam.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:48.022
The river which flows in this place is called as Mula river. 

00:00:48.022 --> 00:01:00.946
 It has been flowing here for thousands of years and is making this place full of punyas.

00:01:00.946 --> 00:01:09.609
We do not have a complete knowledge about punyas.

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:21.232
Many people feel that if we give something to the poor, distribute some things,

00:01:21.232 --> 00:01:29.778
tell the truth or have certain desires then we get punyas.

00:01:29.778 --> 00:01:35.795
Maybe this collection of punyas takes place

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:41.377
but it is like filling up a lake drop by drop.

00:01:41.377 --> 00:01:56.878
The meaning of punyas that is known is doing the work by which God is satisfied and becomes happy.

00:01:56.878 --> 00:02:00.186
We should do such works. 

00:02:00.186 --> 00:02:06.047
A person who does this kind of work is really Punyavaan (one who has punyas)

00:02:06.047 --> 00:02:14.866
 because when he pleases God, then God’s blessings fall upon him and he gets punyas. 

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:19.409
The powers of God which flow into such a person

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:26.469
create something like a new consciousness

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:34.158
or a new personality or a new status in him.

00:02:34.158 --> 00:02:42.840
This new status is such that when this person goes to any house, 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:53.492
 any country, any place, there the blessings of God start raining down. 

00:02:53.492 --> 00:02:59.925
It is as if he has an umbrella and those who come under it are blessed by God.

00:02:59.925 --> 00:03:08.369
Wherever such a person lives, if there is an imminent problem in that place then it gets solved. 

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:16.909
If such people move about in cities or forests

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:20.732
then any accidents that would have taken place don’t do so.

00:03:20.732 --> 00:03:28.187
So, those who have taken birth in Pune are special people with lot of punyas 

00:03:28.187 --> 00:03:35.210
and now they have to earn more benefits through these punyas.

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:41.110
But when a person with punyas is born in Punya nagari,

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:44.935
he starts comparing himself with others.

00:03:44.935 --> 00:03:51.846
 He says that as I have done so many punyas I am born here

00:03:51.846 --> 00:03:59.163
but those people over here who have riches and money over here are different.

00:03:59.163 --> 00:04:09.625
They don’t know God, they don’t believe in God yet they are so rich and happy.

00:04:09.625 --> 00:04:14.970
So why am I unhappy if I have done punyas?

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.310
Such thoughts come into his mind.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:27.667
Once these thoughts come into his mind either he says,’ So I have not understood this thing, but no problem’

00:04:27.667 --> 00:04:34.120
and continues with his dharma or he changes himself.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:45.226
 He changes himself by saying that making money and having material possessions is the greatest thing

00:04:45.226 --> 00:04:50.212
 So he starts running in this new race.

00:04:50.212 --> 00:04:55.270
At this point, all his punyas get destroyed.

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:06.408
It is very surprising to see that a person with punyas gets a desire for money.

00:05:06.408 --> 00:05:07.971
Anything can happen in Kaliyuga.

00:05:07.971 --> 00:05:14.597
 It is surprising to see that in Kaliyuga, even if a Realized Soul is born then

00:05:14.597 --> 00:05:20.720
 he can drink alcohol, take drugs or take to violence. 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:28.587
 It is astonishing that a Realised Soul who is full of punyas can do such things. 

00:05:28.587 --> 00:05:35.019
This is a kind of a pull of Kaliyuga, its effect and its environment. 

00:05:35.019 --> 00:05:44.654
Once a punyavaan person’s sees something, then his attention goes to that thing 

00:05:44.654 --> 00:05:47.923
and develops a weakness for it.

00:05:47.923 --> 00:05:56.683
This is a great tyranny of the Kaliyuga upon us.

00:05:56.683 --> 00:06:01.871
But there is a bright side to it also. 

00:06:01.871 --> 00:06:11.824
 If you ask that what was the need for this tyranny of Kaliyuga to come upon this earth? 

00:06:11.824 --> 00:06:19.427
If Kaliyuga has come then it too must have a reason.

00:06:19.427 --> 00:06:23.047
 On this matter there is something written in Damayanti Akhyaan. 

00:06:23.047 --> 00:06:29.320
Once Kali came into the hands of Nala, Damayanti’s husband.

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:40.139
Nala said,’ You separated me from my wife and caused me great pain so I am going to kill you now!’

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:48.510
Kali said,’ It is alright if you kill me but I too have some importance.’

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:51.038
Nala asked, ‘What importance can you have?

00:06:51.038 --> 00:06:57.705
You put everyone into illusions and people take to the wrong path because of you.’

00:06:57.705 --> 00:07:01.171
Kali replied, ‘There is a great importance. 

00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:07.810
When such a time comes then it will be an Agni Pariksha for man.

00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:12.455
Only then he will know who is true and who is false. 

00:07:12.455 --> 00:07:18.811
This is the only way to judge how much punyas a person has. 

00:07:18.811 --> 00:07:24.615
A person cannot be judged until he goes through this Agni Pariksha.’ 

00:07:24.615 --> 00:07:32.126
It is also written in the Bible, that the person born in the Kaliyuga, 

00:07:32.126 --> 00:07:34.273
his Last Judgement will take place. 

00:07:34.273 --> 00:07:39.289
It will be seen how much punyas and apunyas he has. 

00:07:39.289 --> 00:07:45.040
So, the importance of the Kali Yuga is that our Agni Pariksha takes place in this time. 

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.431
Apart from this Agni Pariksha, there is also a great blessing in this time.

00:07:49.431 --> 00:08:02.560
{Shree Mataji speaking in marathi .not to take photographs during speech}

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:14.011
 Apart from this Agni Pariksha, there is also a great blessing in this time.

00:08:14.011 --> 00:08:24.592
Nala was told that when this time comes, thousands of people will get their Realization, 

00:08:24.592 --> 00:08:39.640
 they will be emancipated, they will transform.

00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:46.949
Kali said,’ Those who are seeking God now in the hills and valleys, will ultimately find Him in Kaliyuga.’ This is the blessing.

00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:52.819
In the middle of this time, we have come to this Punyapatnam

00:08:52.819 --> 00:08:58.056
where a person can understand the effect of punyas.

00:08:58.056 --> 00:09:04.826
But you may feel that here too the same Kaliyuga is present as everywhere else. 

00:09:04.826 --> 00:09:17.811
It should be agreed upon that it is useless to talk about those things which are hidden and which are not seen.

00:09:17.811 --> 00:09:24.518
But now your awareness has opened up and when you use that awareness to know about things,

00:09:24.518 --> 00:09:33.579
 then you will be surprised that in this Pune there have been works of such a depth 

00:09:33.579 --> 00:09:38.115
 as many saints have done penance and meditation over here.

00:09:38.115 --> 00:09:45.441
A great man like Tukaram came and lived near Pune. 

00:09:45.441 --> 00:09:53.611
So this place attracts those people who seek punyas

00:09:53.611 --> 00:09:55.442
and who want to immerse themselves in punyas.

00:09:55.442 --> 00:09:59.915
It is not for those people who are seeking money or other material wealth.

00:09:59.915 --> 00:10:20.920
That is because when we collect money, power or fame, we are collecting it for ourselves.

00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:23.433
But punyas have an effect on others.

00:10:23.433 --> 00:10:36.560
For example if you have a lamp, you can polish it, make it out of gold or silver or anything else, 

00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:44.782
but all that is useless if there is no flame in it. 

00:10:44.782 --> 00:10:48.691
Only when the flame is lit, the lamp is useful.

00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:56.605
In the same way, man is useless, whatever he is, until the light of the Spirit is present in him.

00:10:56.605 --> 00:11:01.024
When the flame is lit in him, he becomes a punyavaan atma

00:11:01.024 --> 00:11:05.258
and the light emanating from him can enlighten thousands of lamps in the world.

00:11:05.258 --> 00:11:12.357
That’s why, the call for this puja in this punya nagari today is a very great thing.

00:11:12.357 --> 00:11:20.372
When the Shakti is distributed through punyas, then punyas get multiplied by thousands and become extremely powerful. 

00:11:20.372 --> 00:11:26.582
Punyas have many powers but if the Shakti Herself is distributed through punyas then what a great thing it is! 

00:11:26.582 --> 00:11:34.735
Until now people have seen that those who are full of punyas, are troubled by others,

00:11:34.735 --> 00:11:43.029
they don’t have any wealth, they don’t have any form of protection, 

00:11:43.029 --> 00:11:46.107
 they are always oppressed by others, 

00:11:46.107 --> 00:11:52.111
any person can take them away, any person can fool him. 

00:11:52.111 --> 00:12:01.480
But when the Shakti is distributed through punyas, then a tremendous energy flows from these punyas

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:05.480
that none can dare to touch a punyavaan person.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.310
If someone touches then he will know that there is some tremendous thing.

00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:18.054
In the same way, if a person feels that he can snatch money, cheat or trouble such a punyavaan person then he can’t do so.

00:12:18.054 --> 00:12:24.379
This is a very great blessing of Kaliyuga that this light can come

00:12:24.379 --> 00:12:30.476
and as soon as this light comes then no one can even touch you with the wrong intentions, no one can trouble you,

00:12:30.476 --> 00:12:37.547
no one can kill you, no one can snatch anything from you.

00:12:37.547 --> 00:12:39.802
You are completely protected.

00:12:39.802 --> 00:12:50.663
You will see that you will become so powerful that you can end any form of terror or problems just by standing up to it.

00:12:50.663 --> 00:12:59.388
So, the vehicle of today is the distribution of Shakti in punyas and this is what has to be achieved in today’s puja.

00:12:59.388 --> 00:13:05.456
Now everyone would have understood what I have told in Hindi.

00:13:05.456 --> 00:13:12.840
Who didn’t understand? 

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:25.640
Among languages, Marathi is quite good because it does not have…. (speech unclear). 

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.111
Especially, I can explain Sahaja Yoga properly only in Marathi language. 

00:13:29.111 --> 00:13:38.105
I told all those things in Hindi because, you will be surprised to know,

00:13:38.105 --> 00:13:40.572
Hindi people know quite less about our culture. 

00:13:40.572 --> 00:13:42.523
 It is not there in their language itself. 

00:13:42.523 --> 00:13:45.061
They don’t know anything;

00:13:45.061 --> 00:13:46.624
 they don’t know what punyas are. 

00:13:46.624 --> 00:13:51.004
So, I talked a little in Hindi as you all know a lot about this. 

00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:59.720
proverb in marathi ...

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:13.092
One thing I must say that the great teachings of the saints that we have got over here, is a very great blessing.

00:14:13.092 --> 00:14:17.859
Due to this blessing, we know what culture is,

00:14:17.859 --> 00:14:20.645
we know the meaning of punyas,

00:14:20.645 --> 00:14:27.120
we know what is good and what is bad, we know. 

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.252
We understand but do not recognize.

00:14:29.252 --> 00:14:33.698
Everyone understands that this is good and that is bad.

00:14:33.698 --> 00:14:36.594
We have done many punyas because of this. 

00:14:36.594 --> 00:14:41.920
That’s why from those punyas, this punya nagari was born.

00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:52.023
But when we see others we feel that we Pune people are not as rich as the Mumbai people.

00:14:52.023 --> 00:14:58.376
Then we feel that Delhi people are richer than Mumbai people.

00:14:58.376 --> 00:15:11.201
As Delhi is the capital, we see that the people are more respectable. But all this is on the outside.

00:15:11.201 --> 00:15:17.465
 We feel that they are very great people in comparison to us.

00:15:17.465 --> 00:15:20.620
But you are Punyavaan.

00:15:20.620 --> 00:15:26.016
However, I have seen many people in Pune who don’t believe in God. 

00:15:26.016 --> 00:15:31.156
I have seen great intellectuals and vidvaans who don’t believe in God. 

00:15:31.156 --> 00:15:39.935
These people have become so sophisticated and their minds are so spoilt that they say God does not exist.

00:15:39.935 --> 00:15:45.964
But if you have not seen God, you have not known Him, then how can you say so confidently that there is no God?

00:15:45.964 --> 00:15:48.060
First try to see. 

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:53.800
What are you going to lose? Nothing.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:16:00.183
 So many people have talked about Him before you, were they all foolish and you are the only clever one? 

00:16:00.183 --> 00:16:02.293
Without knowing Him, how can you conclude that He is not there?

00:16:02.293 --> 00:16:07.850
It is alright if someone says, ‘If you can prove that God exists then I am ready to believe in Him.’ 

00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:16.814
But if someone says, ‘I don’t believe in God at all!’ then it is very difficult to make him understand.

00:16:16.814 --> 00:16:21.091
Many people of this sort are present in this Pune city.

00:16:21.091 --> 00:16:29.433
Nowhere else there are so many people who deny God so openly. 

00:16:29.433 --> 00:16:35.194
You have so many Ganpatis, so many Marutis (Hanuman) but these people are the Maha-Marutis sitting on top! 

00:16:35.194 --> 00:16:37.581
Oversmart people!

00:16:37.581 --> 00:16:44.215
These people feel that whatever they say is correct and that they are extremely clever people. 

00:16:44.215 --> 00:16:49.113
They think that they know all the Shaastras and they conclude that all of it is false and meaningless. 

00:16:49.113 --> 00:17:06.013
So, where this punyas are spread like the fragrance of a lotus, there this ugliness has taken root. 

00:17:06.013 --> 00:17:11.184
Due to this, people’s minds are full of illusions (Bhranti) in Pune.

00:17:11.184 --> 00:17:19.622
The people who don’t understand whether Dharma exists or not, God exists or not call themselves great leaders over here. 

00:17:19.622 --> 00:17:23.793
They eat money all the same and do all the wrong things. 

00:17:23.793 --> 00:17:28.416
But they have an excuse. They say that if we don’t have faith in God and in dharma,

00:17:28.416 --> 00:17:30.100
why should we take to righteousness? 

00:17:30.100 --> 00:17:32.689
We have become ‘modern.’

00:17:32.689 --> 00:17:36.078
Such people are seen more in Pune than in Mumbai. 

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:55.800
There are many people here who make fun of God, who deny God’s existence and who ridicule the people who believe in God.

00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:03.737
Now, a boat drowns if there is just one hole but if there are so many holes like this then what will happen to Pune?

00:18:03.737 --> 00:18:09.887
Some of the holes are caused by people who have a beggarly attitude. 

00:18:09.887 --> 00:18:14.877
This beggarly attitude is seen in Sahaja Yoga also. Sometimes people are afraid of it.

00:18:14.877 --> 00:18:19.203
If Pune people have to be called then they say, ‘ Mataji, many people of this type will come, you see to it.’

00:18:19.203 --> 00:18:21.903
They are afraid of this beggarly nature.

00:18:21.903 --> 00:18:25.261
I have experienced only this attitude.

00:18:25.261 --> 00:18:31.556
When we come here then people enjoy eating for free saying ‘Mother is doing everything, She is giving the money, why should we?’

00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:36.170
This attitude shows that the heart is not rich. 

00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:49.259
The reason for this is that those who teach about punyas, who ask us to do punyas, who give big lectures are themselves after money. 

00:18:49.259 --> 00:18:55.166
So the rest of the people feel that this person is sitting here to teach me ‘BrahmAgnyaan’ but himself is beggarly by nature. 

00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:59.745
So, all the citizens bear the results of both these things.

00:18:59.745 --> 00:19:04.523
The first is that those people who talk about Dharma are eating your money.

00:19:04.523 --> 00:19:13.812
They ask, ‘What do you want? A boy? Alright, pay me 100 rupees. 

00:19:13.812 --> 00:19:16.876
But if you give 50 rupees, then you will get a girl child!’ 

00:19:16.876 --> 00:19:22.378
Then the ‘customer’ gives 108 rupees saying that he wants a boy. 

00:19:22.378 --> 00:19:25.680
Why does he want a boy? 

00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.992
That’s because tomorrow he will earn money. 

00:19:27.992 --> 00:19:30.661
Nobody sees the contribution of the daughter-in-law. 

00:19:30.661 --> 00:19:35.605
They want a son just to get more money.

00:19:35.605 --> 00:19:40.432
Actually, the poverty increases because of that and people become poor by nature.

00:19:40.432 --> 00:19:47.762
Even then, now there are thousands of temples, and in every temple you have to give money to God? 

00:19:47.762 --> 00:19:49.713
But does God understand money?

00:19:49.713 --> 00:19:56.240
Has He even seen money?

00:19:56.240 --> 00:20:01.197
The priests say, ‘give four rupees to this God’, ‘give one rupee to that God.’

00:20:01.197 --> 00:20:08.476
‘If you want to do Puja, then you bring a big coconut out of which we will give you this small piece and the rest goes into our stomach!’

00:20:08.476 --> 00:20:21.199
By seeing these two sides, the faith in man’s mind, which should have depth, purity and trust,

00:20:21.199 --> 00:20:26.535
only has the feeling that ‘Oh now I have done this thing in the temple and that is enough. There’s nothing more to it.’

00:20:26.535 --> 00:20:31.956
So because of this nature and this desire for money, man feels that it is alright to get money in any possible manner.

00:20:31.956 --> 00:20:38.557
 Nobody thinks of self-respect. 

00:20:38.557 --> 00:20:42.540
They think ‘what do we get out of self-respect? Why should we take to it?’

00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:53.733
So because of this strange situation,

00:20:53.733 --> 00:21:06.571
we see from the nature of the people that in such a place full of punyas, we cannot see the saints.

00:21:06.571 --> 00:21:08.607
We cannot see the qualities of a saint. 

00:21:08.607 --> 00:21:11.329
We cannot see a person living like a saint.

00:21:11.329 --> 00:21:13.205
A saint has so much respect! 

00:21:13.205 --> 00:21:19.777
Even to invite a saint to your house needs your penance of lives together. 

00:21:19.777 --> 00:21:23.820
 Otherwise, he won’t even come to your door.

00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:26.798
But this is for a true saint and not for the false ones. 

00:21:26.798 --> 00:21:35.960
 In order for him to come to your door, you should have some punyas.

00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:40.896
But the so-called saints who are roaming in the streets nowadays do not have the sainthood.

00:21:40.896 --> 00:21:48.730
This Punya Nagari is not called so because of its temples but because of its people. 

00:21:48.730 --> 00:21:55.200
How many people have the qualities of a saint here?

00:21:55.200 --> 00:22:09.000
So the punyas come here based on the qualities and character of the people living here.

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:14.190
So, if we earn the punyas of self-respect 

00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:20.135
and self-realization 

00:22:20.135 --> 00:22:31.457
and if we grow in it then there is no difficulty over here. 

00:22:31.457 --> 00:22:42.920
The land in Pune is very fertile and there is no land like it in the entire universe.

00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:47.368
But if there is land then plastic trees won’t come up. 

00:22:47.368 --> 00:22:51.573
What is the use of planting plastic seeds? 

00:22:51.573 --> 00:22:54.372
It is a very fertile land.

00:22:54.372 --> 00:22:57.651
Also, the heads of people are very fertile!

00:22:57.651 --> 00:23:01.159
It is so fertile that you don’t know what has gone out of it and you have to be told about it.

00:23:01.159 --> 00:23:04.326
People say, ‘don’t believe in God’, ‘who is God?’ etc. 

00:23:04.326 --> 00:23:12.787
All such extremely nonsensical things have come up over here.

00:23:12.787 --> 00:23:15.980
Some people make fun of God as if they are very great.

00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:20.480
They don’t have any respect for Him. 

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:27.392
The second kind of people is of those who have earned so much money in the name of dharma

00:23:27.392 --> 00:23:31.665
and who have misled so many people.

00:23:31.665 --> 00:23:36.221
I have seen many varieties of people over here.

00:23:36.221 --> 00:23:43.160
The first time I came to Pune, there were many people and this woman was also there. 

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:45.886
 A bhoot came into her and immediately she started shouting.

00:23:45.886 --> 00:23:48.245
Immediately, all the women ran to apply kumkum on her.

00:23:48.245 --> 00:23:53.529
It was the first time I saw ladies running to put kumkum on a woman in whom a bhoot had come.

00:23:53.529 --> 00:23:55.695
They then started falling at her feet. 

00:23:55.695 --> 00:23:59.056
Luckily, the lights went out at that time

00:23:59.056 --> 00:24:00.893
and I came out from the back door. 

00:24:00.893 --> 00:24:02.284
What could I have explained to them?

00:24:02.284 --> 00:24:07.070
 So this is a greater stupidity than the other kinds. 

00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:15.560
 People see that something has come into her body and assume that it is the Devi. 

00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:18.702
Let me ask you, is it so easy for the Devi to come into anyone’s body? It is extremely difficult. 

00:24:18.702 --> 00:24:21.501
Is there any kind of body that can bear the Devi?

00:24:21.501 --> 00:24:31.814
They say that the Devi has come in her body and later if you see then this ‘devi’ is washing utensils, washing clothes and stealing money!

00:24:31.814 --> 00:24:34.584
How can Devi come into the body of such a person?

00:24:34.584 --> 00:24:40.620
You can call this ignorance or innocence but I would call this extreme stupidity.

00:24:40.620 --> 00:24:51.327
Due to this, the people are not only misled but they are under an illusion.

00:24:51.327 --> 00:25:02.471
There are many people here in whose body the Devi comes and they faint when they come in front of Me.

00:25:02.471 --> 00:25:05.268
 It had become difficult to conduct programs.

00:25:05.268 --> 00:25:08.189
I said,’ How did so many bhoots come into this Punya Nagari?’

00:25:08.189 --> 00:25:15.300
so an so fellow ..and then what did that fellow do ..?

00:25:15.300 --> 00:25:16.478
No, just gave me embers

00:25:16.478 --> 00:25:20.360
What you did, I ate it

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:27.846
That is, the chance of what is called women's behavior and Brahmin behavior has been drowned in Pune.

00:25:27.846 --> 00:25:31.535
Then you made this decision about religion

00:25:31.535 --> 00:25:35.800
And do not talk about the god. 

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:41.957
Because being very wise about the things of God, one cannot say that God does not exist

00:25:41.957 --> 00:25:43.510
science is everything. 

00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:50.622
Now Nardikar is from Pune

00:25:50.622 --> 00:26:00.470
He said that there is intelligence in the relationship that Shrushti works with

00:26:00.470 --> 00:26:07.440
He told the first thing  that he has a head.He is a scientist

00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:09.209
When he is from Pune, thats why this thing came to his head.

00:26:09.209 --> 00:26:14.359
But how far will the scientist go?

00:26:14.359 --> 00:26:24.088
If you want to save a tree from the outside, if you water it, will the water go inside?

00:26:24.088 --> 00:26:28.440
 If water is given to a flower, will it go inside? will not go

00:26:28.440 --> 00:26:31.438
You should water it at the root.

00:26:31.438 --> 00:26:37.003
And you have to get down to add water to its term

00:26:37.003 --> 00:26:39.725
And for that you have to go subtle too.

00:26:39.725 --> 00:26:44.535
Anything you do without that subtlety is out there.

00:26:44.535 --> 00:26:46.177
everything will be for outside. 

00:26:46.177 --> 00:26:51.283
But it is so out of place that the virtuous cannot be found.

00:26:51.283 --> 00:27:00.961
Then it happened that it should be said in some arrangement that even if the relationship is said to be the kingdom of bhoots, it can be arranged.

00:27:00.961 --> 00:27:06.120
If it is said of Satan, it can happen to arranged. It can  be easily. 

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:13.120
But still this land is so hard that if anyone comes it will drive them away, throws them, and crushes them.

00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:15.795
This is the characteristic of this land.

00:27:15.795 --> 00:27:30.865
But despite this, if we remember that we are born in a great land that is virtuous in the universe. 

00:27:30.865 --> 00:27:36.720
Then what can be richer than this?What will be the magnitude on this?

00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:38.510
What can be more respect than this?

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:46.604
your soil of Pune is so important, people have taken the  Pune soil, you don't know.

00:27:46.604 --> 00:27:53.451
When we built that ashram in London, they brought soil there, I asked, where did they bring this soil from? Said,we brought soil from Pune.

00:27:53.451 --> 00:27:57.274
They have such a wisdom  and there is no God here like the Most Wise. 

00:27:57.274 --> 00:28:03.190
And they put that soil.

00:28:03.190 --> 00:28:13.027
No matter how much I explain, no matter how much I say, you will say, Mother, give me the revelation, then given the revelation.

00:28:13.027 --> 00:28:17.774
Because this is what you see in the middle of these things, because these are lies

00:28:17.774 --> 00:28:20.581
Is this outside  or its gross?

00:28:20.581 --> 00:28:22.694
Subtlety is needed to see subtlety.

00:28:22.694 --> 00:28:27.560
If you are subtle you will know what I mean.Therefore, should be subtle.

00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:32.225
That's when I said that chaitanya must flow in this holy city.

00:28:32.225 --> 00:28:39.569
Now the question of money, that thought should be left.

00:28:39.569 --> 00:28:44.840
Lakshmi coves with Shakti. Will get for sure. 

00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:51.600
But if you say that we have come to worship for Lakshmi (money), you will not get anything.

00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:58.440
Lakshmi's prasad is easily available to you automatically and many have got it.

00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.240
many have Got this.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:05.480
But, it should be noted that ,what we came here to get?

00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:11.227
I came to take shakti, in shakti  there is shakti of all kinds. 

00:29:11.227 --> 00:29:21.273
Not just lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi, Not just Sarawati,but Mahasaraswati, not just kali but Mahakali. 

00:29:21.273 --> 00:29:23.521
You have come here to get all this.

00:29:23.521 --> 00:29:35.920
When the form of Atma manifests in these three forces, these three superpowers also awaken in you.

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:41.862
Vibrations of consciousness are flowing through your hands.

00:29:41.862 --> 00:29:45.483
Just raising your hand like this  you give realisation to people.

00:29:45.483 --> 00:29:53.149
What will people say? Not possible 
How can you raise your hand like this, and you give realisation , it is not possible. 

00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:57.233
Then you also start to feel this disbelief.

00:29:57.233 --> 00:30:02.309
Really, we raised our hands like this, what is happening with our hands,this  is special.

00:30:02.309 --> 00:30:04.495
It means you don't value yourself yet.

00:30:04.495 --> 00:30:09.014
You don't understand what you got.

00:30:09.014 --> 00:30:11.119
How great  are you?

00:30:11.119 --> 00:30:23.908
Kundalini in your hand Just like Ganapati has this power in your hand, you have this power in your hand that just by raising your hand, the Kundalini is awakened.

00:30:23.908 --> 00:30:30.160
So who are we?This should be noted first.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:35.272
If you realize who we are and we are yogis,

00:30:35.272 --> 00:30:49.400
We have a power that people never had before. Look how many yogis are there in the world today? Have you heard of anyone awakening Kundalini somewhere? 

00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.520
but you do wake up the kundalini. you are giving the realisation to people. 

00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:58.400
So how is it happening?

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:06.668
But if we give priority to one point that we are yogis, the rest of the points automatically fit in. 

00:31:06.668 --> 00:31:11.040
But the priority is on other things.This is a hassle.

00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:23.111
If you leave it and prefer only one that we are yogis, we should live like a yogi and act like a saints. 

00:31:23.111 --> 00:31:29.974
In such a heart, if a thought is kept, the Kundalini Shakti that is there will take you anywhere.

00:31:29.974 --> 00:31:41.826
Because you have got it easily 
Other people have to work hard to get it.

00:31:41.826 --> 00:31:50.880
If a person walks on the road with special attention, one glance at him awakens his kundalini.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:59.680
This is true but as easy as it gets,It is not valued as much.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:09.120
don't know the vaue of it. You don't know the value because you get the thing without paying for it, without effort.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:10.559
And you don't know the value of yourself.

00:32:10.559 --> 00:32:19.738
If we know your own worth and know your own responsibility, you will realize that you are yogis.

00:32:19.738 --> 00:32:26.358
Mother has gone to spear the whole world and you are my hands.

00:32:26.358 --> 00:32:29.035
This work should be done by You. 

00:32:29.035 --> 00:32:32.742
And how are you doing?

00:32:32.742 --> 00:32:39.677
So first of all we need loyalty, we need sincerity,

00:32:39.677 --> 00:32:45.436
How can a person who has no loyalty and is superstitious get into Sahaja Yoga?

00:32:45.436 --> 00:32:55.560
Loyalty is needed that we are yogis,with full loyalty we believe in ourselves we can do this work.

00:32:55.560 --> 00:33:00.560
There is nothing egoistic about Kundalini flowing through our hands

00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:03.685
If you say we are Hindu,Muslims, Christians then this is a lie.

00:33:03.685 --> 00:33:07.741
It is a certificate affixed to something external.

00:33:07.741 --> 00:33:10.143
You can be anyone.

00:33:10.143 --> 00:33:15.280
But what is true is that you are a yogi and that is your true caste.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:17.736
This is your true religion.

00:33:17.736 --> 00:33:19.610
This is your true personality.

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:29.195
And having complete faith in it, we should sincerely think that we do not want anything beyond this.

00:33:29.195 --> 00:33:34.097
We don't want anything beyond what we want to get.

00:33:34.097 --> 00:33:39.773
Then you get everything in it, you are deep in it, in its depthness, you get everything in its answer.

00:33:39.773 --> 00:33:46.825
But still, my mother is like this,my sister is like this,this happened to my son. 

00:33:46.825 --> 00:33:54.691
Otherwise, if we want this property, please fix it for my brother, mother, and for my uncle.

00:33:54.691 --> 00:33:56.663
That is the question of complexity.

00:33:56.663 --> 00:33:58.466
Well the old sahaja yogis is  little better now.

00:33:58.466 --> 00:34:02.120
Then the second wave came again and they started the same way.

00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:09.318
My mother is not well, my father is not well, everyone has a mother and father,but that is fine in a sense.

00:34:09.318 --> 00:34:12.197
But for Sahaja Yoga sometimes creates many drawbacks.

00:34:12.197 --> 00:34:14.379
Because all goals are different.

00:34:14.379 --> 00:34:17.330
If you get well, your parents will all get well.

00:34:17.330 --> 00:34:24.179
But you are not ready to heal yourself and you want Mother to heal everyone.

00:34:24.179 --> 00:34:32.890
That is, these things are so deep that we should remember that we are deep or not?

00:34:32.890 --> 00:34:35.227
Do you have any depth or not?

00:34:35.227 --> 00:34:37.256
Otherwise we are going to perish.

00:34:37.256 --> 00:34:49.820
If you want to descend into a well, you should also know its full extent.

00:34:49.820 --> 00:34:54.066
If you can't reach, why go to the well, you will run out.

00:34:54.066 --> 00:35:06.682
Am I the kind of person I need to get down to that depth?

00:35:06.682 --> 00:35:09.948
Have I got it?

00:35:09.948 --> 00:35:11.993
Have I earned it?

00:35:11.993 --> 00:35:17.102
But no, heal your mother, oh, what will you gain by healing your mother?

00:35:17.102 --> 00:35:18.740
We only understand selfishness.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.260
What did you get? If your mother does well, she will be angry again as soon as she wakes up.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:26.107
Take a cover over your head or else do this and do that.

00:35:26.107 --> 00:35:32.400
If there is something for the women, why not treat the father?

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.975
Will hurt you again.

00:35:33.975 --> 00:35:45.530
I don't mean to give, but what I have to say is that it is very superficial and if you look at it, it becomes such a problem

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:53.623
But deep down It should be that I am my own father, I am my own mother, I am everything.

00:35:53.623 --> 00:35:56.557
If everyone is in you, everyone will be fine.

00:35:56.557 --> 00:36:04.651
Everyone lives in your body. If you get well, will it get well or not?

00:36:04.651 --> 00:36:13.993
So don't lose so much by setting your mind on such a superficial things.

00:36:13.993 --> 00:36:18.796
For one, being born in the city of Pune must have earned so much of punya. 

00:36:18.796 --> 00:36:26.633
After earning so much punya, you were born in this virtuous city and want to spend it now after being born here?

00:36:26.633 --> 00:36:33.164
And in the matter of this religion also the head should be kept in mind

00:36:33.164 --> 00:36:34.765
what religion do you call this?All his superficial things.  

00:36:34.765 --> 00:36:41.853
That religion is true in which man finds peace.

00:36:41.853 --> 00:36:44.624
That religion is true in which man finds truth.

00:36:44.624 --> 00:36:52.720
That religion is true in which man becomes a virtuous soul and spreads love everywhere.That is true religion

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:57.840
The rest of the religions are false and all the religions of today are better than one another.

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:02.163
Even till today I have never met a Dharma Guru who is self-realized.

00:37:02.163 --> 00:37:09.160
Say we are religious gurus, why? And the Kundalini is sitting down there what kind of religious guru are you?

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:15.522
In which religion it is said that you can become guru  without self-realization?

00:37:15.522 --> 00:37:19.829
Such unrighteous people today have come above religion and call themselves righteous.

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:21.794
That righteousness is of no use.

00:37:21.794 --> 00:37:29.739
They just made a human being a cruel monstrosity.

00:37:29.739 --> 00:37:35.920
I can see that goodness will never come out of it.

00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:38.235
This is the type of religious people these days.

00:37:38.235 --> 00:37:44.961
Look here, you see the people of England drinking alcohol.

00:37:44.961 --> 00:37:49.481
why say,We drank alcohol because we wanted to go to church. what is that?

00:37:49.481 --> 00:37:56.879
Why look at others, look at your own form of Hinduism,

00:37:56.879 --> 00:38:01.065
Later, there are more Christian people who have gone out completely.

00:38:01.065 --> 00:38:07.108
Muslims, they were fighting, all over the world they are fighting.

00:38:07.108 --> 00:38:09.347
Sikh people, nonsense there too. 

00:38:09.347 --> 00:38:16.040
In whose religion tell me people are perfectly fine.

00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:18.026
Why do you want to join those fools?

00:38:18.026 --> 00:38:21.644
Has anyone given peace to your heart?

00:38:21.644 --> 00:38:31.560
If this is the case in all religions, it is said that all religion is the refuge of the mother of all religions, only for this.( धर्म सर्वधर्मान्परित्यज्य मामेकं शरण व्रज )

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:36.686
One should take that , which is true religion.

00:38:36.686 --> 00:38:46.120
Krishna was no less that he had grown now, you all know that. and what was Ram ? 

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:50.252
All such incarnation took place.

00:38:50.252 --> 00:38:53.927
Mohammad Saheb was not less?
Nanak Saheb was not less?

00:38:53.927 --> 00:39:00.437
But their place is kept somewhere by all, all and only, I am not ready to support any religion.

00:39:00.437 --> 00:39:02.398
Everyone is watched.

00:39:02.398 --> 00:39:05.240
Everyone is a fool.

00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:14.188
They do foolish things in the name of God and they are going to get such share at birth, no need to go far for it.

00:39:14.188 --> 00:39:18.533
That,Jewish is another example.

00:39:18.533 --> 00:39:19.909
A Muslim is the third pattern.

00:39:19.909 --> 00:39:21.631
Christians are the fourth pattern.

00:39:21.631 --> 00:39:27.684
Hindus are the second pattern, one by one, that Jains, don't ask what it is.

00:39:27.684 --> 00:39:38.910
All this religion has spread and monetized so much lies and falsehoods.

00:39:38.910 --> 00:39:51.760
And something else, now among the Muslims is that you have to pray five times, just pray.

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.876
And do whatever business you want after that.

00:39:53.876 --> 00:40:00.991
They are fighting among themselves, this country is fighting with him, that country is fighting with him.Not easy to say.

00:40:00.991 --> 00:40:09.874
Mohammad Saheb has said that such a time will come and he calls it Qayama.

00:40:09.874 --> 00:40:14.655
Qayama means a time when man will be resurrected.

00:40:14.655 --> 00:40:20.960
When the time of the resurrection comes, their hands and feet will speak and testify when the time of the resurrection comes.

00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:24.112
This Sahaj Yoga has explained everything  but to all  these fools.

00:40:24.112 --> 00:40:28.440
Which Muslim will come to you? have came now a few.

00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:32.152
This is the kind of religion we have screwed up.

00:40:32.152 --> 00:40:41.800
Go to the temple and see these days, there was a boy who used to take drugs for months. Where did you get this drugs in India? 

00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:43.056
In the temple of Mahalakshmi, there is a priest he is giving drugs to that boy.What is this? 

00:40:43.056 --> 00:40:52.760
This is truth.yes , this is truth.

00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:54.890
In the temple of Mahalakshmi , just imagine.

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:59.523
Now tell where to keep this priest, where to keep?

00:40:59.523 --> 00:41:05.680
There is no place for such people in hell, something else has to be made for them

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:12.300
Sitting in Mahalakshmi's temple, smoking drugs and selling it.
No police will go to the temple of Mahalakshmi, he knows that.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:17.688
If he goes, then they will say against him that you have come to our temple.

00:41:17.688 --> 00:41:21.149
But by sitting in the temple, taking drugs is all right for them. 

00:41:21.149 --> 00:41:26.720
Many people said that God is not the source of all such devoutness

00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:30.600
There is no religion for anyone because of  unreligiousmess of others.

00:41:30.600 --> 00:41:35.370
If anyone earns money in the name of God, then there is no God?

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:42.395
So,you, sahaja yogis  have to get down very deep in your ascent.

00:41:42.395 --> 00:41:48.838
Your life should be such that people should say that this is the true religion among the true religious.

00:41:48.838 --> 00:41:53.672
We have understood Dharma in this sahaja yoga.

00:41:53.672 --> 00:41:57.823
In Sahaja Yoga we understood what religion is?

00:41:57.823 --> 00:42:05.120
Self realisation is an event that has happened in us, there is nothing false,

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:10.847
But even for to say that, you have to go deep in your ascent.

00:42:10.847 --> 00:42:13.727
You must deepen.

00:42:13.727 --> 00:42:24.896
If you don't bring that depth, then people will say in front of people, let it be, we have seen how your Sahaj Yogis are.

00:42:24.896 --> 00:42:37.924
So everyone should aim at those key points, don't show off at all.

00:42:37.924 --> 00:42:40.878
I understand everyone.

00:42:40.878 --> 00:42:45.335
Puja should be attended by pure hearted people. If not, don't sit.

00:42:45.335 --> 00:42:46.845
Sit with a pure heart.

00:42:46.845 --> 00:42:50.272
what is the use of working so hard?

00:42:50.272 --> 00:42:53.258
 If you have a clouded heart, what will be my reflection in it?

00:42:53.258 --> 00:42:56.729
Cleanse your heart.

00:42:56.729 --> 00:43:03.240
Just purify the heart and sit in love and get it.

00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.960
You are here to get what you want.

00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:09.560
Remember that you have not come here to waste your time anywhere

00:43:09.560 --> 00:43:18.342
You have come here to awaken the true religion among us and to advance the truth among us.

00:43:18.342 --> 00:43:24.754
Today's worship of Shakti is special because what we call Shakti at this time is Gauri Swaroop.

00:43:24.754 --> 00:43:31.800
Gauri is literally Kundalini in virginity.

00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:38.320
You have worshiped her in the state of virginity, and virginity means innocence.

00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.729
Her awakening is like Ganapati, Shakti's virgin state is the boon of Ganapati.

00:43:44.729 --> 00:43:58.328
Then, thinking like this in your heart, say how pure it is, or let it be completely rooted in us.

00:43:58.328 --> 00:44:01.180
We must be clean from the inside out.

00:44:01.180 --> 00:44:04.469
Let us worship in that deep state today.
