00:00:17.958 --> 00:00:21.545
Yesterday I told you about the physical side

00:00:23.695 --> 00:00:29.787
how to physically achieve the balance

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:36.799
by doing all these movements and all that
and there is also raising your Kundalini like that

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.623
and how to put certain chakras in places.

00:00:40.703 --> 00:00:44.251
Like first of all the Mooladhara,
which is very important,

00:00:44.331 --> 00:00:50.078
Mooladhara Chakra – for that the exercise,
as I told you, has to be with both the feet …

00:00:50.158 --> 00:00:55.965
Can We try that again? Just
to put both the feet together …

00:00:56.045 --> 00:01:00.687
Now I tried to pull it towards yourself.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:05.811
No, no – with this, now, holding it, yes,

00:01:05.891 --> 00:01:10.145
towards yourself and push the thing down …

00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:19.367
Yes … Now, the other way round, the other
way round you can do it, is to push it downward

00:01:19.447 --> 00:01:22.842
and pull your – with the hands – you push it down.

00:01:22.922 --> 00:01:26.959
Yes now, push it up – the,
the heels –

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.629
yes, now, push it towards yourself, again, again.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.052
Now put it down on the sides.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.420
It is stiff, I must say. All right, again.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.532
Now I tell you one, you may try another thing for this.

00:01:54.612 --> 00:02:00.927
Is to put your, one foot across
and one foot like this, that’s it.

00:02:01.007 --> 00:02:05.862
Push it, ha … now it’s better,
that way … now push it up.

00:02:05.942 --> 00:02:12.605
It is this one, upward, just push it how
much you can, push that down … yes …

00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:16.384
push one down and one push up, it is better …

00:02:16.464 --> 00:02:20.132
now the other one you do the same way …

00:02:23.372 --> 00:02:29.528
push that down at the center, ha … now push that up …

00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:36.213
with one hand you can push that up, with one hand
you can push that down … would be a better idea …

00:02:36.293 --> 00:02:41.652
now like this, like this,
like this … just try, now ah …

00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:45.787
hold it from the sides, hold it
from the sides, like he is holding …

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:48.981
no, no, that ha-, that, put it down, your hand, yes.

00:02:49.061 --> 00:02:52.582
Now hold it this foot with the left hand,

00:02:52.662 --> 00:02:57.142
with the left hand, it doesn’t go that side,

00:02:57.222 --> 00:03:02.553
it’s like the way he is
sitting … all right, it’s all right.

00:03:02.633 --> 00:03:06.409
Now push it, push it down, this one and push that up,

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.630
push that up and push
this down.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:15.052
Now the other one you try,
now the other one you try, again.

00:03:20.382 --> 00:03:21.882
Hmm.

00:03:23.322 --> 00:03:25.998
Can you? No, no, no – that one down now.

00:03:26.078 --> 00:03:28.972
Which one was, yes, correct, correct, now.

00:03:29.052 --> 00:03:36.507
This is the other way – ha. Just push that
one down, as much as you can. Push this down.

00:03:36.587 --> 00:03:41.783
Now you will see it will little bit opened
out. Now see yourself, is it opening out?

00:03:41.863 --> 00:03:48.292
Now put it, put it down again.
See, is it better now for sitting.

00:03:48.372 --> 00:03:53.215
Better?

00:03:53.295 --> 00:03:55.599
Now see now, is it better?

00:03:55.679 --> 00:04:00.625
Like it! It’s better now.

00:04:00.706 --> 00:04:01.818
Yogi: Now here.

00:04:01.898 --> 00:04:05.391
Shri Mataji: Try it. Yeah. You
see, gradually it will work out,

00:04:05.471 --> 00:04:09.103
gradually it will work out for you people,
because you are not used to it, not,

00:04:09.184 --> 00:04:13.236
so at this age also it’s rather
difficult, but it will work out,

00:04:13.316 --> 00:04:17.351
gradually that – … You sit like
that!

00:04:17.431 --> 00:04:22.449
From now, if she sits like this, you see, from
the very childhood, than she can never sit like that.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.623
Can you sit like that? Let’s
see. Let’s see. If – can see? Ah?

00:04:28.703 --> 00:04:33.397
Ha good, you can do it, you
are good, excellent, she is good.

00:04:33.477 --> 00:04:35.866
Ah, that’s better.
