00:08.099 --> 00:09.099
Shri Krishna Puja Talk
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:09.099 --> 00:10.099
August 16, 1998

00:10.099 --> 00:13.119
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

00:13.119 --> 00:33.149
It is a very important thing about the power
of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state.

00:33.149 --> 00:49.469
This is very important also because, in these
days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of

00:49.469 --> 01:09.210
value system, all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

01:09.210 --> 01:25.670
The state of witnessing is only possible through
meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless

01:25.670 --> 01:26.670
awareness.

01:26.670 --> 01:31.229
It’s combined together.

01:31.229 --> 01:38.650
Now the witness state is such a state where
you just do not react.

01:38.650 --> 01:51.049
If you react, then the problem starts.

01:51.049 --> 02:06.590
It’s a very simple thing to understand that
we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

02:06.590 --> 02:18.280
Otherwise there is no way to react.

02:18.280 --> 02:22.800
Anything, now for example there is a beautiful
carpet here.

02:22.800 --> 02:36.900
As soon as I look at it, if I use My ego I’ll
start thinking, “Now from where did they

02:36.900 --> 02:38.670
get it?

02:38.670 --> 02:43.090
How much they paid it?”

02:43.090 --> 02:47.170
This is the first reaction.

02:47.170 --> 02:50.880
Then you can even go further with it, anger
can come in, “Why did they bring such a

02:50.880 --> 02:52.300
nice carpet?

02:52.300 --> 02:57.980
What was the need to put it here?”

02:57.980 --> 03:04.030
It goes on like that, one after another.

03:04.030 --> 03:11.540
Now in My conditioning if I see these things,
I would say that “This color is not suited

03:11.540 --> 03:21.390
for Krishna Puja, they should have had another
color for this Krishna Puja.”

03:21.390 --> 03:27.250
So this kind goes on from one to another,
to another.

03:27.250 --> 03:33.330
But that means this conditioning is built
up within us.

03:33.330 --> 03:41.600
All our problems of our conditioning are really
horrible.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.140
For example, racialism.

03:45.140 --> 03:47.120
We have racialism.

03:47.120 --> 04:01.410
In America it’s very much more, you can
feel it though they don’t say; but if you

04:01.410 --> 04:08.870
go, say, from Italy you feel it, if you go
from India also you can feel it.

04:08.870 --> 04:14.190
Now why this racialism is there?

04:14.190 --> 04:16.880
What is the reason?

04:16.880 --> 04:32.960
Why do we react to this kind of horrible hatred
for another community or another color which

04:32.960 --> 04:38.340
is only skin-deep?

04:38.340 --> 04:46.600
Now with rationality you might be able to
explain, “O God, these people, they are

04:46.600 --> 04:56.750
absolutely useless,” or “They have come
to our country and are just troubling us.”

04:56.750 --> 04:59.880
All these conditionings are there.

04:59.880 --> 05:07.580
But if you see when they talk of immigrants,
the Americans must know they are immigrants,

05:07.580 --> 05:09.060
all of them.

05:09.060 --> 05:13.570
America never was their country.

05:13.570 --> 05:19.810
And they threw away all the other Red Indians,
took away their land and very nicely they

05:19.810 --> 05:22.350
are governors of America.

05:22.350 --> 05:35.030
But the reaction is, “Those who are not
white complexion, they are all to be condemned,

05:35.030 --> 05:36.220
tortured.”

05:36.220 --> 05:45.990
Now if they are by nature violent, then also
this conditioning of violence comes in.

05:45.990 --> 05:50.120
Then they start killing each other.

05:50.120 --> 06:00.190
They have killed ruthlessly so many people,
thinking that they have a right to go into

06:00.190 --> 06:09.640
any country and kill everyone and take the
land that is not their own.

06:09.640 --> 06:14.080
Actually, land doesn’t belong to anybody
as such.

06:14.080 --> 06:21.900
But nobody has a right to go to some land
and try to occupy it, and throw away the people

06:21.900 --> 06:24.950
who do not belong to that country.

06:24.950 --> 06:38.060
Yesterday was the Independence Day of India,
and I have seen the flag going up, our national

06:38.060 --> 06:49.040
flag, and the British flag going down.

06:49.040 --> 06:59.800
All that has happened after so much of struggle,
so much of sufferings of the people, because

06:59.800 --> 07:07.870
they came to India, landed nicely there and
became the masters.

07:07.870 --> 07:17.060
So this is also a kind of a conditioning that
comes in a collective way, that you go into

07:17.060 --> 07:24.520
anybody’s country, throw away the people
from there or sort of occupy that place, and

07:24.520 --> 07:25.760
become the masters.

07:25.760 --> 07:33.790
It’s like going into somebody’s house
that belongs to somebody, and throw away the

07:33.790 --> 07:44.050
people who are inside and nicely settle there
as the owners and the masters, because they

07:44.050 --> 07:48.960
have better intelligence, perhaps the cunning
more in them.

07:48.960 --> 08:00.930
With that cunning, if the white people think
they can rule the black people, is not where

08:00.930 --> 08:34.729
you can develop a witness state.

08:34.729 --> 08:43.490
So this kind of conditioning is like a plague
and moves from one country to another country,

08:43.490 --> 08:49.870
where some people think they are superior
and make people look inferior.

08:49.870 --> 08:55.970
And the people also are there who accept this
kind of a situation, accept this kind of a

08:55.970 --> 09:04.029
position, where they are supposed to be equal.

09:04.029 --> 09:11.240
I would say take the example of America, because
this has been celebrated by Americans and

09:11.240 --> 09:17.839
because Krishna is the Ruler, Krishna is the
Ruler of America.

09:17.839 --> 09:25.470
He Himself was a dark person, Himself was
on the black side.

09:25.470 --> 09:37.149
And in the same country where He rules, the
another great thing is that they don’t realize

09:37.149 --> 09:47.529
that if all the black or the Asians get out
of that country now, I don’t know what will

09:47.529 --> 09:48.759
happen to them.

09:48.759 --> 09:53.430
All their sports are managed by the blacks.

09:53.430 --> 10:02.720
If you want to see any American sport, ninety-nine
per cent are black people.

10:02.720 --> 10:10.829
Then if you want to also see the music, because
these black people, though they have black

10:10.829 --> 10:20.929
color - which is all right: as you have white,
they have black color - but they have a voice

10:20.929 --> 10:24.540
which the white people don’t have.

10:24.540 --> 10:30.600
They can sing so well that no white people
can compete with them.

10:30.600 --> 10:37.119
It’s a full justice done to the color.

10:37.119 --> 10:47.360
Now if you take out the Asians, all doctors,
all nurses, all architects, all accountants,

10:47.360 --> 10:51.619
all of them will disappear.

10:51.619 --> 10:55.029
Now what will remain?

10:55.029 --> 11:05.819
You have to understand that it is color which
is nothing to do, nothing to do with your

11:05.819 --> 11:11.910
intelligence, with your value system, with
your Spirit.

11:11.910 --> 11:18.190
We are here to achieve our spirituality.

11:18.190 --> 11:30.579
The Spirit doesn’t understand color because
it is so superficial, and it is so very cruel

11:30.579 --> 11:36.829
to condemn someone for the color.

11:36.829 --> 11:40.269
Same now is happening as the reaction.

11:40.269 --> 11:45.100
Every action has a reaction.

11:45.100 --> 11:51.569
So what happens is that you find the blacks
are reacting.

11:51.569 --> 11:57.499
They are reacting, and their reaction can
be very dangerous.

11:57.499 --> 12:10.829
Every day I read their reactions are coming
up so badly; not in America but all over,

12:10.829 --> 12:15.509
they are now thinking they must rise and oppose
this domination.

12:15.509 --> 12:25.519
But in their own country where they have people
of different colors, little variation I think,

12:25.519 --> 12:34.420
they are all black people but little variation
maybe, so they form groups and they start

12:34.420 --> 12:38.339
cutting each other’s throats.

12:38.339 --> 12:43.690
I’ve seen on the television how ruthlessly
they kill.

12:43.690 --> 12:51.819
I don’t know what is the difference of color
is, but somehow they have formed groups and

12:51.819 --> 12:56.449
this group will go and kill that, and that
group will come and kill.

12:56.449 --> 13:01.529
It’s not like Kaurava and Pandava.

13:01.529 --> 13:08.019
It’s not two types of people absolutely
opposite, it’s not that the negative and

13:08.019 --> 13:10.499
the positive is there, it’s not.

13:10.499 --> 13:18.189
They are all negative, whether they are white
or black, and they start quarreling and fighting

13:18.189 --> 13:21.319
with each other.

13:21.319 --> 13:23.790
Now this violence is growing so much.

13:23.790 --> 13:31.290
I think violence is the only weapon they use
now to express themselves.

13:31.290 --> 13:41.759
You see here something happens, so somewhere
there you find they explode bombs and kill

13:41.759 --> 13:43.410
so many innocent people.

13:43.410 --> 13:49.139
It’s very, very sinful to do like that.

13:49.139 --> 13:56.190
Even the slightest violence is sinful, and
this kind of a violence, in the eyes of Shri

13:56.190 --> 14:06.360
Krishna, are absolutely to be punished very
well.

14:06.360 --> 14:09.779
Now this comes through ego.

14:09.779 --> 14:17.510
You think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill, or something like

14:17.510 --> 14:18.510
that.

14:18.510 --> 14:26.579
A funny idea into human mind comes in, and
you decide that you have a right to kill another

14:26.579 --> 14:27.589
person.

14:27.589 --> 14:35.029
Or one may say this comes from hatred, but
hatred is an outcome of ego.

14:35.029 --> 14:45.829
When the ego starts acting, it collects all
these things like hatred, also possessiveness,

14:45.829 --> 14:57.189
anger, violence, all these starts coming out
of the ego, which actually blinds the person.

14:57.189 --> 15:03.689
You become blind to the fact that there is
no need to have violence, no need to hate

15:03.689 --> 15:11.660
someone, no need to kill anyone because of
this ego that is there.

15:11.660 --> 15:17.350
Now one may say, “Mother, how does this
ego build up in a people?”

15:17.350 --> 15:24.690
Of course, mostly it is due to reactions,
also it is due to the conditioning.

15:24.690 --> 15:32.540
If the child is told from the childhood that
“You should hate these people, they are

15:32.540 --> 15:33.929
to be hated.

15:33.929 --> 15:41.059
They are wrong people, they are bad people,”
they just start doing that.

15:41.059 --> 15:49.959
When they grow up they start showing that
hatred is now like a cactus growing very big,

15:49.959 --> 15:52.589
and is killing others.

15:52.589 --> 15:59.929
There’s no justification for this kind of
a behavior by human beings.

15:59.929 --> 16:08.779
If they are human beings they have to have
human qualities, and that is what is possible

16:08.779 --> 16:17.699
only if you learn how to just witness and
not to react.

16:17.699 --> 16:23.329
For example you see two cocks are fighting.

16:23.329 --> 16:25.999
You enjoy that.

16:25.999 --> 16:30.959
Two cocks are fighting, people are enjoying.

16:30.959 --> 16:37.209
One cock dies, they are very happy, as if
the one which died had killed his parents

16:37.209 --> 16:39.120
or did something like that.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.040
Very surprising!

16:41.040 --> 16:45.790
Now in Spain even now there are these bull-fights
going on.

16:45.790 --> 16:52.970
Every year six bull-fights, every year, and
the hall contains more than ten times more

16:52.970 --> 16:58.420
than we have here, and is always full.

16:58.420 --> 17:02.980
And now the women have taken to fight the
bulls.

17:02.980 --> 17:08.530
Now if the bull is not killed, they allow
the bulls to go on the street and kill people.

17:08.530 --> 17:22.809
This kind of a violent enjoyment is still
lingering into the minds of the people.

17:22.809 --> 17:33.650
It is so sad to see people who are now talking
of humanity, talking of peace, talking of

17:33.650 --> 17:40.419
joy, are still enjoying these violent acts.

17:40.419 --> 17:46.100
Either they are doing or they want to watch.

17:46.100 --> 17:53.250
So then you go to these films and things that
have been created of a horrible violence,

17:53.250 --> 17:59.890
and people enjoy it, enjoy such films, and
such films are again created.

17:59.890 --> 18:07.800
Now if you really become a witness state,
if you are in a witness state, then what will

18:07.800 --> 18:08.800
happen?

18:08.800 --> 18:16.580
If you watch any such things that are happening,
it will subside.

18:16.580 --> 18:27.080
If you are in a witness state and if that
level, then no accident will take place in

18:27.080 --> 18:29.080
your sight.

18:29.080 --> 18:37.990
Even if there is an accident, then you can
save the person, you can help the person very

18:37.990 --> 18:38.990
actively.

18:38.990 --> 18:45.710
That’s in a very small scale, but even in
a very large scale you can do it, something

18:45.710 --> 18:46.710
wonderful.

18:46.710 --> 18:53.809
I remember I was not very old at that time,
but we were living in a house very close to

18:53.809 --> 18:58.500
the Secretariat, where they had a strike.

18:58.500 --> 19:05.000
And they were asking for a separate Maharashtra
or something.

19:05.000 --> 19:12.430
So the police was standing there and by the
order of the Chief Minister they were shooting

19:12.430 --> 19:19.490
at everyone who was coming, anyone who passed
through that road they were shooting, they

19:19.490 --> 19:22.289
were enjoying their shooting game, all of
them.

19:22.289 --> 19:25.960
I saw all this and I just couldn’t bear
it.

19:25.960 --> 19:30.190
I just went down, went down and asked the
police to stop it.

19:30.190 --> 19:34.260
They stopped, you’d be amazed, they stopped.

19:34.260 --> 19:40.220
Then I carried those people who were wounded
up in My house, took out their bullets and

19:40.220 --> 19:43.690
all that, called the ambulance and saved them.

19:43.690 --> 19:50.230
But for that one thing was there: I was in
a state of witnessing, so you become fearless.

19:50.230 --> 19:58.990
There is no fear at all, once you learn how
to have the state of witnessing.

19:58.990 --> 20:07.130
Because when you are not witnessing you get
disturbed, you get upset, you get excited,

20:07.130 --> 20:10.090
you may join also these wrong type of people.

20:10.090 --> 20:17.990
But if you are in a state of witnessing, that
itself is a power.

20:17.990 --> 20:27.350
And that witnessing state helps you to win
over so many difficulties of other people.

20:27.350 --> 20:34.750
There’s this Chinese story about a saint.

20:34.750 --> 20:42.360
So one king brought his cock to him and said,
“You train my cock in such a way that he

20:42.360 --> 20:43.360
should win.”

20:43.360 --> 20:44.570
He said, “All right.”

20:44.570 --> 20:56.220
So he kept the cock of the king for one month
and when the show started, different cocks

20:56.220 --> 21:02.019
came from different places and they all started
fighting.

21:02.019 --> 21:08.420
This cock just stood up and was watching,
just watching.

21:08.420 --> 21:14.179
And other cocks got such a fright, they couldn’t
understand how this fellow is not disturbed,

21:14.179 --> 21:17.539
he’s just watching, he’s standing, he’s
doing nothing.

21:17.539 --> 21:24.200
So all they disappeared from the arena and
he was declared as the successful one.

21:24.200 --> 21:28.630
So this is the best way to bring non-violence.

21:28.630 --> 21:38.519
In violent places you go and stand steadily
there, facing all the things that are happening,

21:38.519 --> 21:52.389
and that witness state acts, acts and stops
that kind of a violence that is going on.

21:52.389 --> 22:02.269
But witness state is not a mental state, it
is a state of a spiritual ascent where you

22:02.269 --> 22:06.009
become a witness.

22:06.009 --> 22:14.549
Best way to practice witness state is not
to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

22:14.549 --> 22:19.450
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing
others.

22:19.450 --> 22:23.340
They cannot criticize themselves, so they
start criticizing other.

22:23.340 --> 22:28.500
So much so that they don’t even see what’s
wrong with them.

22:28.500 --> 22:34.450
They don’t even see what wrong they have
done to others, because they think they have

22:34.450 --> 22:40.480
a right to criticize others, and they enjoy
this criticism very well.

22:40.480 --> 22:44.150
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

22:44.150 --> 22:47.259
You just watch and see for yourself.

22:47.259 --> 22:49.740
That’s all is your right.

22:49.740 --> 22:53.940
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

22:53.940 --> 23:00.870
But some people think if you do not criticize,
then it will go on like this and it will never

23:00.870 --> 23:01.870
stop.

23:01.870 --> 23:02.870
It’s not that!

23:02.870 --> 23:06.649
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just
watch.

23:06.649 --> 23:14.990
Your attention itself is enlightened now,
with that enlightened attention you can just

23:14.990 --> 23:20.100
watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

23:20.100 --> 23:25.840
But we are always conscious that we are something
great, and we have to do this and we have

23:25.840 --> 23:28.769
to do that.

23:28.769 --> 23:38.380
Under these circumstances what happens is
that you become another problem.

23:38.380 --> 23:41.009
Because what can you do?

23:41.009 --> 23:43.649
You can’t do anything.

23:43.649 --> 23:47.940
But what you can do is to watch.

23:47.940 --> 23:57.960
By watching and by just seeing things as they
are, you really develop a very different state

23:57.960 --> 24:00.169
of being.

24:00.169 --> 24:11.879
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,
what happens to them is very interesting,

24:11.879 --> 24:18.240
that their memory loss is much less, because
whatever they see becomes like a picture to

24:18.240 --> 24:19.240
them.

24:19.240 --> 24:24.980
Like you can say, they can tell you even the
color, the folding, everything.

24:24.980 --> 24:31.800
Whatever they see is so much in their mind
like a photo, and they can tell you exactly

24:31.800 --> 24:39.570
what they have seen, and your memory is not
lost.

24:39.570 --> 24:46.900
While if you react onto everything, your memory
becomes horrible.

24:46.900 --> 24:52.019
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

24:52.019 --> 25:00.570
Like I know of one gentleman, he had a habit
of reacting, and I was going with him in the

25:00.570 --> 25:01.570
car.

25:01.570 --> 25:14.690
So he was reading every advertisement, every
name of every shop, every person, everything.

25:14.690 --> 25:16.990
He was just telling, “Who is that?

25:16.990 --> 25:18.100
What is that?”

25:18.100 --> 25:19.100
- this, that.

25:19.100 --> 25:24.879
I was wondering, “Look at this gentleman,
he’s talking so much, what will happen to

25:24.879 --> 25:25.879
him?”

25:25.879 --> 25:33.340
But ultimately I’ve found that all such
people who are all the time reacting become,

25:33.340 --> 25:39.770
actually they have, I think, senile decay
or maybe they become forgetful, very forgetful.

25:39.770 --> 25:45.629
But this is not the only loss we have.

25:45.629 --> 25:53.129
With this kind of people, when they are formed
into a collective they can be very dangerous

25:53.129 --> 25:58.879
people, because with that kind of a nature
they have to do something.

25:58.879 --> 26:05.230
They must do something because, after all,
they are combined together for a purpose or,

26:05.230 --> 26:09.899
we can say, for some reactions which all of
them have built up.

26:09.899 --> 26:15.659
In small things, in big things, you’ll find
people do like that.

26:15.659 --> 26:24.139
And some people who are very much, very much
developed in this kind of behavior can collect

26:24.139 --> 26:28.799
lots of people, and do any amount of harm
to others.

26:28.799 --> 26:32.049
I would look at the picture of Hitler.

26:32.049 --> 26:37.210
For nine years this fellow was watching what
wrongs Jews are doing.

26:37.210 --> 26:47.009
He wouldn’t watch what Germans are doing,
what wrong they are doing to the society.

26:47.009 --> 26:53.630
And that time the society also was very bad,
because they were having all kinds of licentiousness.

26:53.630 --> 27:00.679
Now he was noting down, “These Jews are
like this, they do this, they take money,

27:00.679 --> 27:05.460
they - lending money,” all kinds of things
he got into his head.

27:05.460 --> 27:12.210
As a result of that he built up a reaction
into him that “We must somehow or another

27:12.210 --> 27:17.570
see that these people go away from Germany.”

27:17.570 --> 27:23.580
But then he thought, “Even if they go away
from Germany, they’ll prosper again.

27:23.580 --> 27:25.039
So why not kill them?”

27:25.039 --> 27:33.200
I mean, to such an extent that even, you know,
you cannot see such films, you cannot see

27:33.200 --> 27:36.669
anything of that nature that Hitler did.

27:36.669 --> 27:44.669
But he did it, and people who followed him
also did it without feeling any hitch, as

27:44.669 --> 27:52.110
if it was a matter of great pleasure or a
joy, or maybe it’s a duty.

27:52.110 --> 27:58.279
How could they get duty bound to such a horrible
thing like killing thousands and thousands

27:58.279 --> 28:01.470
of Jews?

28:01.470 --> 28:05.720
What Jews had done to them, they could have
corrected it.

28:05.720 --> 28:08.980
But why did they indulge into such violence?

28:08.980 --> 28:12.990
And they wanted to finish all the Jews of
the world.

28:12.990 --> 28:21.259
It can be very, very dangerous, because once
you start losing your witness state you can

28:21.259 --> 28:26.169
fall into negative collectivity.

28:26.169 --> 28:33.269
And thus this negative collectivity acts,
acts in such a bad manner that all the conflicts

28:33.269 --> 28:40.539
of the world, all the problems of the world
perhaps are related with this.

28:40.539 --> 28:51.129
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

28:51.129 --> 29:02.009
We should not react, we should not react.

29:02.009 --> 29:11.399
If you see something wrong, all right, you
meditate on that point, you meditate.

29:11.399 --> 29:20.269
If you find anything wrong happening, all
right, meditate on that.

29:20.269 --> 29:25.399
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment
do not react.

29:25.399 --> 29:34.669
Afterwards when that person is quietened,
you tell him or tell her, because at that

29:34.669 --> 29:40.390
time when he’s so volatile or she’s volatile
if you tell, nothing will happen.

29:40.390 --> 29:47.789
Gradually, I don’t say always you can win
over such people, but gradually you may be

29:47.789 --> 29:56.600
able to make them understand that it’s wrong,
it’s wrong to do things which they have

29:56.600 --> 29:58.320
been doing.

29:58.320 --> 30:10.379
In a way, you see, the reaction to anything
which is stupid also can be very self-destroying.

30:10.379 --> 30:15.190
Like some people have built-in reactions,
like you have seen this Mr. Clinton behaving.

30:15.190 --> 30:22.350
I mean, you can’t understand a man of his
stature, of his level should have such reactions,

30:22.350 --> 30:29.350
but must be from his childhood or I don’t
know how he built it up.

30:29.350 --> 30:33.419
Now he is in trouble, and very shameful.

30:33.419 --> 30:45.340
This also is, I think perhaps comes from a
very great indulgence into reactions.

30:45.340 --> 30:52.659
Why should you react to a woman, I can’t
understand, or to a man?

30:52.659 --> 30:59.590
And this is one of the biggest problems of
today’s culture, specially in all the developed

30:59.590 --> 31:06.039
countries, that all the time men are looking
at women, women are looking at men.

31:06.039 --> 31:07.820
For what?

31:07.820 --> 31:12.730
Perhaps they look at women because they want
to see how many women are looking at them.

31:12.730 --> 31:20.620
Or they look at men perhaps may be that how
many men are looking at them.

31:20.620 --> 31:23.049
Why, why is this happening?

31:23.049 --> 31:29.460
Because they have some inferiority complex
in them, or that they want to attract the

31:29.460 --> 31:30.600
attention of everyone.

31:30.600 --> 31:36.169
I mean, horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others, to get

31:36.169 --> 31:37.700
the sympathy of others.

31:37.700 --> 31:43.090
I mean, if you see the level of your awareness
where it goes, you’ll be amazed.

31:43.090 --> 31:49.889
Like they say one lady killed her eight children
just to get sympathy from others.

31:49.889 --> 31:56.649
But think of such horrible things people are
doing.

31:56.649 --> 32:10.141
Now if you want others to have reaction you
do this, that they want others to see you

32:10.141 --> 32:19.999
or to react to you, I don’t know, to give
you importance, you can say.

32:19.999 --> 32:21.990
But what is the use of such an empty importance?

32:21.990 --> 32:33.370
But people are seeking, and is a very common
disease of modern life: all the time how you

32:33.370 --> 32:39.220
should look, how you should appear, how you
should walk.

32:39.220 --> 32:44.520
Everything is so stupid and wastage of energy.

32:44.520 --> 32:56.369
God has created human beings very, very different,
none of them are copies, none of them.

32:56.369 --> 33:05.379
Even in the nature you find the leaves of
trees, they are so unique, you cannot match

33:05.379 --> 33:08.880
them with another leaf.

33:08.880 --> 33:12.750
So that’s how human beings are created,
differently.

33:12.750 --> 33:16.630
They are made like that.

33:16.630 --> 33:20.220
One has to accept.

33:20.220 --> 33:22.259
Whatever you are, it’s all right.

33:22.259 --> 33:26.450
Why do you want to look like another person?

33:26.450 --> 33:33.290
This kind of reaction is extremely stupid,
I think, that we are spoiling our energy and

33:33.290 --> 33:39.649
life for something absolutely worthless.

33:39.649 --> 33:43.529
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is
great.

33:43.529 --> 33:54.919
You have come here to emancipate human beings
from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the

33:54.919 --> 33:58.640
way people are behaving.

33:58.640 --> 34:04.980
I don’t know whom to blame, but suddenly
our attention has become very diversified,

34:04.980 --> 34:09.110
our reactions have become very, very funny.

34:09.110 --> 34:17.240
One doesn’t know why people react like that,
and then why do we worry about what people

34:17.240 --> 34:18.240
react?

34:18.240 --> 34:26.760
All these things are not only on individual
level, but also on a collective level.

34:26.760 --> 34:32.890
As a result, you see, new kinds of value system
has been created.

34:32.890 --> 34:43.320
Now for a mother, say for example, she’ll
boast of how many men are running after her.

34:43.320 --> 34:48.030
Or she would think she is a great actress
- I don’t know what they think of themselves.

34:48.030 --> 34:51.429
And the way they talk about themselves is
something surprising.

34:51.429 --> 34:59.430
If she’s a mother, she has to be a good
mother and she has to look like a mother.

34:59.430 --> 35:13.520
But they are so much engrossed or they are
so much standing on the basis that they have

35:13.520 --> 35:24.670
to be extremely attractive, they have to be
the queens or I don’t know what, what a

35:24.670 --> 35:26.370
position they want to have.

35:26.370 --> 35:28.590
Same with the men.

35:28.590 --> 35:38.690
You see, if you have something within you,
if there is any quality within you, is there

35:38.690 --> 35:45.190
anything that can qualify you as a great man,
it will be showing.

35:45.190 --> 35:53.460
You don’t have to advertise, you don’t
have to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing.

35:53.460 --> 36:02.910
So that indifference if you have towards the
public opinion, I think you can achieve a

36:02.910 --> 36:04.100
lot.

36:04.100 --> 36:06.430
Most of the frustrations will disappear.

36:06.430 --> 36:14.670
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want
to show off a lot.

36:14.670 --> 36:17.030
I know who does that.

36:17.030 --> 36:25.660
But they should know, once you do not react
to outside you start reacting to inside, and

36:25.660 --> 36:31.880
introspection will start properly.

36:31.880 --> 36:46.890
When you see yourself you’ll be amazed how
admiring you are, how happy you are.

36:46.890 --> 36:55.640
Now if you go beyond that a little more, then
you don’t think of all these things.

36:55.640 --> 37:06.700
You just become thoughtless and you just stand
up as a person who is respected, whose company

37:06.700 --> 37:15.510
is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for.

37:15.510 --> 37:21.030
So one should not worry as to what people
react, what they say about you, what they

37:21.030 --> 37:23.530
think about you.

37:23.530 --> 37:28.220
You should just introspect and see for yourself.

37:28.220 --> 37:41.750
After some time you don’t need even introspection.

37:41.750 --> 37:51.350
It is a kind of a state I am talking about,
where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “I will

37:51.350 --> 37:55.820
not fight.

37:55.820 --> 38:06.340
So in between Me and the army, My army, you
have to select.”

38:06.340 --> 38:10.040
So Kauravas said, “No, we’ll take Your
army, Your army.

38:10.040 --> 38:17.010
You give us Your army and we’ll strengthen
our army.”

38:17.010 --> 38:24.530
But Arjuna said, “I don’t want army, I
want You.

38:24.530 --> 38:30.000
You don’t want to fight, it’s all right.”

38:30.000 --> 38:39.760
Because though He will be there in a witness
state only, He won’t be fighting but His

38:39.760 --> 38:42.640
power will act.

38:42.640 --> 38:52.360
He doesn’t have to fight, He doesn’t have
to do anything, but His own power which is

38:52.360 --> 39:01.570
outwardly is silent but will act, and that
is how we will win the war.

39:01.570 --> 39:04.580
So this power of witnessing you all should
develop.

39:04.580 --> 39:21.830
Try to develop it that when you are reacting,
stop reaction, stop reaction about everything.

39:21.830 --> 39:27.820
You will be amazed, you will find yourself
a very, very powerful person in the sense

39:27.820 --> 39:36.740
you’ll have no ambitions, you’ll have
no desires, you’ll have no special fondness

39:36.740 --> 39:39.200
or anything.

39:39.200 --> 39:42.780
But just you are witnessing the drama.

39:42.780 --> 39:50.511
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

39:50.511 --> 39:55.840
you understand the stupidity behind everything.

39:55.840 --> 40:08.180
You understand also how people have been so
violent, and you just laugh at it; you don’t

40:08.180 --> 40:14.070
get upset, excited, nothing, just laugh at
it.

40:14.070 --> 40:21.220
After some time you’ll be amazed, your witness
state will increase, and when in the collective

40:21.220 --> 40:32.441
all of you have that witness state, you can
do wonders without doing anything, without

40:32.441 --> 40:39.780
saying anything, without acting - only your
presence itself can work it out.

40:39.780 --> 40:45.630
I don’t say that it will have effect on
everyone, no, can’t say; but most of the

40:45.630 --> 40:48.980
people.

40:48.980 --> 41:00.140
Any person who is in that state, he is the
one who brings peace, he brings joy.

41:00.140 --> 41:09.980
I’ll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi who
was going to another island - he was living

41:09.980 --> 41:18.740
in an island - for Sahaja Yoga work, and he
found the whole sky was covered with very

41:18.740 --> 41:21.510
black clouds, thundering clouds.

41:21.510 --> 41:29.670
So he just looked at them like this and he
said, “Wait till I come back.

41:29.670 --> 41:34.160
I am going to do Mother’s work.”

41:34.160 --> 41:44.980
He went to another island, he did the program,
everything happened and when he came back

41:44.980 --> 41:54.680
he wanted to sleep, and suddenly it started
raining and thundering.

41:54.680 --> 41:57.380
Even the nature understands.

41:57.380 --> 42:04.140
Nature understands that you are in that great
state of witnessing.

42:04.140 --> 42:11.380
But if you are very ambitious - even in Sahaja
Yoga I have known people who are very ambitious,

42:11.380 --> 42:15.490
they want to become leaders, I don’t know
what else.

42:15.490 --> 42:17.520
Actually, it’s all a myth.

42:17.520 --> 42:24.900
All mythical things they want to get to, and
worry their heads about mythical things.

42:24.900 --> 42:31.790
Once you learn how to witness you will know
the myth, you will know the absurdity, you

42:31.790 --> 42:34.060
will know the maya.

42:34.060 --> 42:46.360
So to overcome the problems of personality
the best thing is to witness, practice witnessing

42:46.360 --> 42:56.480
everything: before talking, practice witnessing,
before giving any comments, just start witnessing.

42:56.480 --> 43:00.560
It’s a very, very satisfying attitude.

43:00.560 --> 43:15.650
In Shri Krishna’s life the greatest power
He was, a witnessing personality.

43:15.650 --> 43:26.830
Without doing anything, without taking a sword
in His hands, without talking about fighting,

43:26.830 --> 43:37.570
He is the One who has helped Pandavas to win
the war.

43:37.570 --> 43:47.320
Not only, but through His “Gita” He has
tried to tell us what we have to do to win

43:47.320 --> 43:50.400
the war over evil.

43:50.400 --> 43:58.670
Whole “Gita” is the witness state He’s
described about.

43:58.670 --> 44:05.030
If you read it “Gita” now from this angle,
you’ll be amazed to find that everywhere

44:05.030 --> 44:11.400
He is like a witness describing everything,
whatever He sees.

44:11.400 --> 44:22.870
And He will tell you how, how this witness
state has helped Him to understand also human

44:22.870 --> 44:23.870
beings.

44:23.870 --> 44:33.270
He is a man who was, we should say, was not
such a big businessman; because first He told

44:33.270 --> 44:36.320
you that how to become sthita pragnya.

44:36.320 --> 44:42.650
“Sthita pragnya” is the one who is in
the witness state.

44:42.650 --> 44:50.240
If you see all these verses on sthita pragnya,
is nothing but a person who is in a witness

44:50.240 --> 44:57.680
state: how he lives, how he is happy, how
he looks at things.

44:57.680 --> 45:00.610
It’s interesting, very interesting.

45:00.610 --> 45:06.820
First He describes that, not like the sharp
people who will describe first the bad things,

45:06.820 --> 45:09.360
but He starts with the best.

45:09.360 --> 45:20.110
Then He goes down to other things and tell
you that whatever are the three aspects.

45:20.110 --> 45:26.760
The first He talks about karma, and many people
get stuck at that point, that “Whatever

45:26.760 --> 45:30.750
karmas we are doing, we’ll get the punyas
out of it.”

45:30.750 --> 45:33.940
But He is not.

45:33.940 --> 45:37.140
He didn’t say that.

45:37.140 --> 45:41.160
If you know Him, then you will know He never
meant that.

45:41.160 --> 45:52.040
What He says, that “Whatever karmas you
have to do, you can do it, but leave the results

45:52.040 --> 45:54.890
to the Divine Power.”

45:54.890 --> 46:02.040
Results are from the Divine Power.

46:02.040 --> 46:10.770
Now may be that some people think that they
have got money because they have done good

46:10.770 --> 46:18.160
karmas, and start doing all kinds of bad karmas
with that money.

46:18.160 --> 46:19.490
He didn’t say that.

46:19.490 --> 46:24.180
He said, “Leave the results to the Divine
Power.”

46:24.180 --> 46:30.240
Because Divine Power knows best what is for
you.

46:30.240 --> 46:36.330
And so if you think you have done something
good, you have served somewhere to the poor,

46:36.330 --> 46:45.810
you have done something really good for the
women or anything; the result of that, you

46:45.810 --> 46:56.980
leave it at the feet of the Divine Power - means
that you don’t build up an ego for whatever

46:56.980 --> 46:59.300
you have done.

46:59.300 --> 47:05.490
Though very well He has written this, but
to understand Him one should have again the

47:05.490 --> 47:11.750
witness state to see what He has written about
karma.

47:11.750 --> 47:13.960
Then He has written about gnyana.

47:13.960 --> 47:18.330
Gnyana means “where you know.”

47:18.330 --> 47:24.910
But that doesn’t mean you go on reading
books, never.

47:24.910 --> 47:33.400
Gnyana means to know what you are.

47:33.400 --> 47:46.890
That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi, by
which you know so many things through vibrations.

47:46.890 --> 47:52.850
Gnyana doesn’t mean reading books.

47:52.850 --> 47:58.170
By reading books you become more ignorant.

47:58.170 --> 48:06.810
So gnyana means that you must know yourself.

48:06.810 --> 48:10.970
If you do not know yourself, you do not know
anything.

48:10.970 --> 48:16.930
So it comes to, that you must get your Self
Realization.

48:16.930 --> 48:18.380
You must know yourself.

48:18.380 --> 48:20.770
It’s the second thing He has said.

48:20.770 --> 48:24.000
Lastly, He talks about bhakti.

48:24.000 --> 48:29.600
Bhakti is devotion.

48:29.600 --> 48:33.780
That too is another trick of Shri Krishna,
the way He describes bhakti.

48:33.780 --> 48:40.680
Now you find people on the street, “Hare
Rama, Hare Krishna” singing.

48:40.680 --> 48:46.500
In one word He is concluded: He says, “You
must do ananya bhakti.”

48:46.500 --> 48:50.800
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

48:50.800 --> 48:58.080
That means when you have submerged yourself
into the Divine, you are one with the Divine,

48:58.080 --> 49:03.310
then you should do bhakti, otherwise I do
not accept.

49:03.310 --> 49:17.310
He says that “If you give Me some leaves
or some fruits or some flowers, I will accept,

49:17.310 --> 49:27.280
I will accept,” but for Him the real bhakti
is only possible when you become one with

49:27.280 --> 49:34.480
the Divine; otherwise it’s just a show.

49:34.480 --> 49:39.610
So the third bhakti part also comes after
Self Realization.

49:39.610 --> 49:52.170
Now in the bhakti you see there is no “what
is the value is and how much you’ve paid

49:52.170 --> 49:55.630
for it, and how you bought it”- it’s not
important.

49:55.630 --> 50:05.680
For that, a great example is of Shri Rama
when He went in the jungles.

50:05.680 --> 50:17.800
There was a old lady from the schedules caste,
means she was one of the Bhilini as they call

50:17.800 --> 50:21.850
it, these people live in the jungles.

50:21.850 --> 50:29.490
So she brought some berries and offered it
to Shri Ram.

50:29.490 --> 50:38.320
And she said that “I have tasted all of
them and they are not sour, all of them I

50:38.320 --> 50:39.900
have tasted.”

50:39.900 --> 50:48.480
Now after tasting something in India, people
call it, is become not to be eaten.

50:48.480 --> 50:53.440
I mean, we cannot taste something and give
it to somebody else, it’s not done according

50:53.440 --> 50:54.890
to Indian culture.

50:54.890 --> 50:57.300
But Shri Rama took it.

50:57.300 --> 51:01.150
He took it and said, “What beautiful fruits!

51:01.150 --> 51:06.750
I’ve never eaten such fruits!”

51:06.750 --> 51:08.390
So Lakshmana got very angry.

51:08.390 --> 51:13.820
He said, “You stupid woman, you have eaten
these fruits and that’s what you are giving

51:13.820 --> 51:15.010
to Shri Ram.

51:15.010 --> 51:18.730
Why did you do that?”

51:18.730 --> 51:25.250
So Sita was watching, so She asked Him, “Why
don’t You give Me some of these fruits?”

51:25.250 --> 51:26.600
He gave.

51:26.600 --> 51:31.060
She said, “My God, what nice fruits these
are!

51:31.060 --> 51:34.100
I have never eaten such good fruits.”

51:34.100 --> 51:39.040
So then Lakshmana also, His temper came down
and He said, “Can You not give Me some?”

51:39.040 --> 51:40.150
She said, “Why?

51:40.150 --> 51:43.470
You were so angry, why should I give You?”

51:43.470 --> 51:45.830
Ultimately She gives Him that fruit.

51:45.830 --> 51:47.380
So what did He see in those fruits?

51:47.380 --> 52:00.550
It was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was important.

52:00.550 --> 52:06.980
So when you want to give something also it
is your love which is important, not how much

52:06.980 --> 52:09.970
you paid, what value you have spent, nothing.

52:09.970 --> 52:17.350
It’s the love with which you do it, and
that love should be evident.

52:17.350 --> 52:26.420
If such things can happen, even with Shri
Krishna the same thing happened.

52:26.420 --> 52:36.130
He went to - they called it Hastinapur in
those days, where these Kauravas were ruling.

52:36.130 --> 52:40.761
And the king was Duryodhana, and he asked
Him, “You come and stay with us and have

52:40.761 --> 52:41.761
food.”

52:41.761 --> 52:44.690
He said, “No, no, I won’t be able to come.”

52:44.690 --> 52:52.100
He goes to another person, Vidhura, who was
the son of a maidservant; Vidhura, because

52:52.100 --> 52:55.690
Vidhura was a realized soul.

52:55.690 --> 53:02.870
He was a realized soul, so He went and ate
in his house, where he had cooked very simple

53:02.870 --> 53:03.870
food.

53:03.870 --> 53:09.930
Because he was a realized soul, to Him he
was the best to have food with.

53:09.930 --> 53:18.200
So your value system should be based on such
things like love.

53:18.200 --> 53:23.540
Where you can get love, you should be attached
to that person.

53:23.540 --> 53:29.940
Where you get a realized soul, you should
be attached to them and not to worldly people

53:29.940 --> 53:33.660
who think no end of themselves, and think
that they are great.

53:33.660 --> 53:42.900
They may be, but to you as Sahaja Yogis it’s
the love of people which should be respected,

53:42.900 --> 53:47.510
should be understood and to be felt.

53:47.510 --> 53:52.690
But if you have no witness state, then you
will see how much money this man has got,

53:52.690 --> 54:01.340
how many cars he has got, what clothes he’s
wearing, all these considerations will be

54:01.340 --> 54:02.340
there.

54:02.340 --> 54:07.510
But in a witness state, you will understand
that you will get vibrations from this person,

54:07.510 --> 54:10.560
you will understand that person is spiritual.

54:10.560 --> 54:19.600
And that’s how you will stick to such a
person, you will not go for artificial things,

54:19.600 --> 54:20.600
but the genuine personalities that are there.

54:20.600 --> 54:21.600
May God bless you all.

54:21.600 --> 54:22.600
Thank you.

54:22.600 --> 54:23.600
Today they have decided to read some of the
names Sahaja Yogis have got with them, and

54:23.600 --> 54:24.600
they want to distribute, they have distributed
these names to you.

54:24.600 --> 54:25.600
So somebody will read those names of Shri
Krishna.

54:25.600 --> 54:26.600
Now just imagine with witness state all these
powers that are described of Shri Krishna,

54:26.600 --> 54:27.600
how they will act and how they will work through
you.

54:27.600 --> 54:28.600
(After the Puja):
Hello!

54:28.600 --> 54:29.600
I would say that after this Puja I expected
all of you to keep quiet.

54:29.600 --> 54:30.600
But everybody was talking, I don’t know
why, what had happened to you.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.600
You must enjoy the silence within yourself.

54:31.600 --> 54:32.600
I hope you will understand that.

54:32.600 --> 54:32.602
Thank you.
