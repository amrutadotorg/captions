00:00.310 --> 00:15.380
Today we are here, all of us, to celebrate
a four day festival called as Diwali.

00:15.380 --> 00:18.980
Diwali comes from the word ‘dipali’; ‘dipali’
in Sanskrit.

00:18.980 --> 00:26.220
The word ‘deepa’ means ‘the lights’,
and ‘ali’ means the ‘line’, the ‘rows’.

00:26.220 --> 00:33.980
Now, there are many things that have happened
during these four days and that’s how it

00:33.980 --> 00:45.360
is celebrated with such a great enthusiasm.

00:45.360 --> 00:50.520
The first thing is the day of the Lakshmi’s
birth.

00:50.520 --> 00:54.570
That is the thirteenth day of the moon, “dhanteras’
they call it.

00:54.570 --> 01:05.239
[Which] is the real day when Lakshmi was born
out of the sea; that’s why She is called

01:05.239 --> 01:08.500
as Miriam or Maryam.

01:08.500 --> 01:20.009
The word ‘Marie’ or ‘Marine’, also
comes from the word ‘sea’.

01:20.009 --> 01:31.289
So, She’s born out of the sea, She’s created
out of the sea.

01:31.289 --> 01:41.090
And the wealth of the sea, so far, thank God,
human beings have not yet exploited.

01:41.090 --> 01:45.020
But they may, one day, start doing that also.

01:45.020 --> 01:51.130
And a lot of wealth is still there, so when
people start getting worried about exhausting

01:51.130 --> 02:00.170
the Mother Earth, we must know that sea is
much more than the Earth is, so nothing is

02:00.170 --> 02:01.170
exhausted.

02:01.170 --> 02:10.709
Still there is such a lot in reserve for you,
and one should not worry as to the supply

02:10.709 --> 02:16.120
of wealth that can come from the sea.

02:16.120 --> 02:26.140
Now, this Lakshmi is the goddess who stands
on the lotus.

02:26.140 --> 02:51.770
She represents all the well-being, the wealth,
the glory of wealth, the decoration of wealth;

02:51.770 --> 02:55.910
whichever is auspicious.

02:55.910 --> 03:01.870
Whatever is not auspicious is not wealth according
to Sahaja Yoga, or according to any scripture.

03:01.870 --> 03:03.890
It is not wealth at all.

03:03.890 --> 03:14.980
So She is a lady who stands on a lotus: showing
that a person, who has got wealth, has to

03:14.980 --> 03:23.730
be a person who doesn’t assert his pressures
on people, who doesn’t push people around,

03:23.730 --> 03:26.500
who doesn’t pressurise.

03:26.500 --> 03:31.500
And then She’s a lady, She’s a mother.

03:31.500 --> 03:45.609
So wealth, is the first opening to our seeking.

03:45.609 --> 03:49.719
But when you start seeking the wealth, you
realise that the superficial wealth that you

03:49.719 --> 03:54.969
are seeking is not sufficient, is not going
to give you complete joy.

03:54.969 --> 03:58.590
So you start seeking the deeper wealth.

03:58.590 --> 04:02.689
As I said that: on the Mother Earth you have
exploited all that is possible [but] still

04:02.689 --> 04:06.219
there, deep down in the sea, a lot of wealth
is still there.

04:06.219 --> 04:13.099
So then the seeking moves towards the deeper
seeking.

04:13.099 --> 04:17.419
So the same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

04:17.419 --> 04:26.610
When you start expanding yourself to higher
and deeper, valuable things then this Lakshmi

04:26.610 --> 04:36.560
doesn’t lure you much: She’s just there
for your glory, but not for your satisfaction.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.890
The wealth is there for distribution only.

04:40.890 --> 04:48.220
You enjoy the…there’s no word for ‘dhan’
[in English] I think?

04:48.220 --> 04:49.780
Yogi: Generosity.

04:49.780 --> 04:52.900
Shri Mataji: Oh, “generosity’!

04:52.900 --> 04:56.009
But generosity is different.

04:56.009 --> 05:01.470
But what I’m saying [is] generous fondness.

05:01.470 --> 05:04.669
It’s a fondness that you should be generous.

05:04.669 --> 05:18.750
Sometimes it’s a very great

05:18.750 --> 05:25.060
happiness and joy that you feel — that is
the greatest — when you are generous, when

05:25.060 --> 05:26.199
you give away.

05:26.199 --> 05:32.889
That’s a fondness, that’s a kind of a
human expression of one’s own being: that

05:32.889 --> 05:35.210
you want to be generous.

05:35.210 --> 05:39.699
And this generosity only can come when Mahalakshmi
principle is born in you.

05:39.699 --> 05:49.880
But at Lakshmi principle also She stands like
this; Her hand is like this one: as giving.

05:49.880 --> 05:51.400
And the other is like this.

05:51.400 --> 05:52.820
So miserliness is not a sign of wealth.

05:52.820 --> 05:56.470
I mean, if you are miserly that means you
are not wealthy.

05:56.470 --> 06:00.680
If you are really wealthy, why will you be
miserly?

06:00.680 --> 06:05.730
This simple question is there.

06:05.730 --> 06:11.240
That means if you are really wealthy, you
will just give away.

06:11.240 --> 06:13.780
If you cannot give away, then you are poor,
you are a beggar.

06:13.780 --> 06:19.129
[If] you are still hankering after that, that
means you are still a beggar, and you are

06:19.129 --> 06:20.129
hankering for it.

06:20.129 --> 06:25.690
So [with] this left hand She is giving all
the time, and with the right hand She protects

06:25.690 --> 06:26.720
people.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.979
She gives protection to people.

06:30.979 --> 06:40.900
The wealth must give protection to people,
in the way [that] it must look after the well

06:40.900 --> 06:49.080
being of others, not your own self-indulgence:
like having all the best things to yourself

06:49.080 --> 06:50.970
while others are starving.

06:50.970 --> 06:54.080
That’s not a sign of a wealthy man.

06:54.080 --> 07:01.780
A wealthy man is a person who knows that,
unless and until he shares his things with

07:01.780 --> 07:03.690
others, he is not going to be happy, ultimately.

07:03.690 --> 07:08.210
For the time being he may be.

07:08.210 --> 07:09.639
People live with imbalances, they live with
wrong ideas.

07:09.639 --> 07:14.099
But ultimately they have to correct it.

07:14.099 --> 07:18.780
If they do not correct this, there are problems.

07:18.780 --> 07:22.810
Then there’s upheaval, lots of changes come
in.

07:22.810 --> 07:27.789
People start seeing that, “Oh, this doesn’t
work out, that doesn’t work out."

07:27.789 --> 07:34.790
The children run away from the houses, the
family goes into problems.

07:34.790 --> 07:39.430
All sorts of things happen, and then they
realise, “This is the reason: I have been

07:39.430 --> 07:40.430
very miserly.

07:40.430 --> 07:41.680
I have not been generous.

07:41.680 --> 07:46.090
I have not been using money for the sake of
others."

07:46.090 --> 07:50.419
Now, after coming to Sahaja Yoga, you become
a Divine person.

07:50.419 --> 07:51.600
Definitely you become Divine.

07:51.600 --> 07:55.159
You are now a Divine personality, you are
not a human personality.

07:55.159 --> 07:59.689
So you have to give up all that is human within
you, then only you will be fully Divine.

07:59.689 --> 08:01.250
But it’s very difficult.

08:01.250 --> 08:07.199
That’s [what] the problem is: that it is
very difficult to really accept that you are

08:07.199 --> 08:12.639
Divine, and that you have to take to Divine
policies and Divine attitudes, and Divine

08:12.639 --> 08:13.639
temperament.

08:13.639 --> 08:16.100
Now, the Divine temperament is generous.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.630
It is not bothered, as to what happens next.

08:19.630 --> 08:23.949
It’s not bothered, because it is connected
with the Source.

08:23.949 --> 08:25.669
If you give one you will get a hundred.

08:25.669 --> 08:31.900
It is sure about it.

08:31.900 --> 08:36.010
And to a Divine person, worldly things have
no meaning, if they cannot give pleasures

08:36.010 --> 08:37.010
to others.

08:37.010 --> 08:41.950
A person who is very self-indulgent, always
bothered about himself, is not a Divine person

08:41.950 --> 08:42.950
at all.

08:42.950 --> 08:45.380
In no way he’s Divine.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.850
It’s very common.

08:46.850 --> 08:47.850
It’s human.

08:47.850 --> 08:49.410
Everybody does that.

08:49.410 --> 08:50.730
Everybody is self-preserving.

08:50.730 --> 08:55.079
But after Sahaja Yoga, you do not start all
this nonsense again; you give it up.

08:55.079 --> 08:59.170
And who looks after you?

08:59.170 --> 09:02.130
Who looks after your self-preservation?

09:02.130 --> 09:04.980
Is God Almighty.

09:04.980 --> 09:10.209
You are now completely dedicated to Him, and
He looks after you.

09:10.209 --> 09:17.670
You don’t have to worry as to how to look
after yourself, how to do this, how to do

09:17.670 --> 09:18.670
that.

09:18.670 --> 09:19.670
It is His work.

09:19.670 --> 09:22.680
The more you go on worrying about yourself,
the worse it will be.

09:22.680 --> 09:26.170
The moment you give it up, it is looked after.

09:26.170 --> 09:30.840
Many Sahaja Yogis must have experienced this
in their lifetime: that when they try to give

09:30.840 --> 09:36.360
it up, they get all the help from God; but
whenever they try to assert, and worry about

09:36.360 --> 09:40.420
their well-being and things like that, then
there is a problem.

09:40.420 --> 09:43.540
You don’t know from where the help comes
in.

09:43.540 --> 09:50.030
And we have had so many examples, so many
so-called miracles, where people wanted to

09:50.030 --> 09:55.709
do something, and suddenly they got the money
from somewhere they least expected.

09:55.709 --> 10:08.940
So for a Divine person, the attitude should
be of giving and of protection: protect.

10:08.940 --> 10:18.700
Now, we are very good at protecting our bhoots,
and protecting others who are bhoots.

10:18.700 --> 10:24.370
You see, the sympathies always go to bhoots,
because they have a way of creating a sympathetic

10:24.370 --> 10:26.050
attitude in your heart.

10:26.050 --> 10:34.300
So you start looking after that person because
that person looks so much miserable.

10:34.300 --> 10:37.120
You have to protect the saints.

10:37.120 --> 10:44.090
You have to protect the principle of God,
the Divinity in others, and not the bhoots.

10:44.090 --> 10:48.930
You are not here to care for all the bhoots
of the world.

10:48.930 --> 10:52.420
So the idea of Lakshmi must be understood
in a proper way.

10:52.420 --> 11:02.120
In Sahaja Yoga it’s a very different thing
from all other people know about; like charity.

11:02.120 --> 11:05.960
Like, people say now, “We must be charitable,
start a charitable organisation."

11:05.960 --> 11:11.740
In that, you look after this kind of people,
that kind of people.

11:11.740 --> 11:12.740
We are not bothered.

11:12.740 --> 11:17.300
That’s not [what] you are given Realisation
for: to look after every sort of a person.

11:17.300 --> 11:24.000
You are here to look after all the saints
and all born-realised children.

11:24.000 --> 11:28.730
And you are not to bother about people who
do not matter to God and Divine.

11:28.730 --> 11:32.820
When they came to Realisation, if they get
Realisation, if they become saints, all right.

11:32.820 --> 11:39.080
But you don’t worry about every Dick, Tom
and Harry, on the street: “Oh Mother, he’s

11:39.080 --> 11:42.620
so miserable!” and this and that.

11:42.620 --> 11:46.910
So the charity must be understood in a Divine
light.

11:46.910 --> 11:53.029
And the Divine light will give you discretion,
to understand whom to be charitable [to].

11:53.029 --> 11:57.339
You have to be charitable to your brothers
and sisters.

11:57.339 --> 11:58.760
You have to be kind to them.

11:58.760 --> 12:03.790
Now you will say: “What about worrying about,
Mother, people who are starving?

12:03.790 --> 12:04.870
Who are this?”

12:04.870 --> 12:06.240
That’s not your headache!

12:06.240 --> 12:08.019
Why should you do their jobs?

12:08.019 --> 12:11.510
You are all good at doing others’ jobs.

12:11.510 --> 12:16.740
For example, you are driving in the car: “Oh,
look at this!

12:16.740 --> 12:19.420
There should have been this properly done!

12:19.420 --> 12:25.019
That they should have done properly!” but
that’s not your job!Why should you waste

12:25.019 --> 12:28.290
your energy in finding out what the others
should have done?

12:28.290 --> 12:30.899
You should do what you have to do.

12:30.899 --> 12:33.100
And don’t waste your energy in these things.

12:33.100 --> 12:37.950
You see, [in] all these charitable institutions,
I have seen [that] those people who work there

12:37.950 --> 12:39.850
are very difficult for Realisation.

12:39.850 --> 12:43.740
This is the proof of the pudding.

12:43.740 --> 12:45.730
Because to whom to do the charity?

12:45.730 --> 12:49.839
If there is no other person, you do not do
charity to anyone!

12:49.839 --> 12:55.260
I mean, sitting down here, I can do charities
to people, so-called, which are not charities,

12:55.260 --> 12:56.699
they are part and parcel of my being.

12:56.699 --> 12:59.990
I just do it, because they are part and parcel
of my being.

12:59.990 --> 13:06.880
I don’t have to go all out to sacrifice
something to do charity, because that’s

13:06.880 --> 13:15.149
nothing but ego pampering and ego-oriented:
“Oh, I have helped this man, and how dare

13:15.149 --> 13:19.490
he say such a thing!”

13:19.490 --> 13:23.589
So this is one quality of the Divine, one
should know, that It is generous.

13:23.589 --> 13:33.300
It is generous to a fault, to a fault.

13:33.300 --> 13:35.890
It is generous because It is generous.

13:35.890 --> 13:36.890
It is not bothered.

13:36.890 --> 13:39.710
It doesn’t reason out Itself: “Why should
I be generous?”

13:39.710 --> 13:44.839
It is generous because It is; because it’s
the whim, it’s a fondness.

13:44.839 --> 13:49.589
The fondness of generosity is such, as you
have fondness, say, people have fondness to

13:49.589 --> 13:51.790
drink, for example let’s say.

13:51.790 --> 13:54.190
That’s not fondness, that’s a habit, I
think.

13:54.190 --> 13:58.029
But you can say some fondness people have.

13:58.029 --> 14:01.580
What kind of a fondness you have, without
forming a habit, I don’t know.

14:01.580 --> 14:04.850
Because you always have a habit and then you
form the fondness.

14:04.850 --> 14:09.980
But supposing you just have a fondness.

14:09.980 --> 14:20.699
For example, you are fond of, say, good food,
let us take it.

14:20.699 --> 14:27.190
Now, if you have fondness of good food, then
you will just do it because you are fond of

14:27.190 --> 14:28.190
it.

14:28.190 --> 14:31.230
Now if somebody says, “Why are you fond
of good food?”

14:31.230 --> 14:33.660
You said, “I am just fond – finished!

14:33.660 --> 14:35.509
Who are you to ask me such a question?”

14:35.509 --> 14:41.339
If somebody is fond of generosity, he will
be generous whether you like it or not.

14:41.339 --> 14:47.930
And it is sometimes, to a reasonable man,
may look to be a bit too much.

14:47.930 --> 14:51.339
The greatest generosity a human being can
do is to forgive.

14:51.339 --> 14:58.070
I mean, it’s not generosity to others but
to yourself.

14:58.070 --> 15:00.690
If you forgive others you are generous to
yourself.

15:00.690 --> 15:05.450
First of all be generous to yourself, that
is you forgive everybody else.

15:05.450 --> 15:14.430
If you forgive everybody else, then you are
not tortured by them; you spare yourself from

15:14.430 --> 15:15.730
their tortures.

15:15.730 --> 15:19.610
This is a generosity towards yourself.

15:19.610 --> 15:26.410
Towards yourself, the greatest generosity
is that you do not bear any malice or bitterness

15:26.410 --> 15:27.470
about anyone.

15:27.470 --> 15:30.959
But clear-cut ideas that, “He’s like this
and he is like this."

15:30.959 --> 15:36.020
Just a clear-cut idea, but no reaction out
of it.

15:36.020 --> 15:41.250
If somebody is a man, say, he’s bhootish:
all right he’s a bhootish fellow, we know

15:41.250 --> 15:46.889
he’s a bhootish, keep yourself in bandhan,
but don’t have a reaction out of that.

15:46.889 --> 15:51.399
Then you have really forgiven everyone.

15:51.399 --> 15:57.640
Forgiveness gives you a big kavacha; is a
big bandhan, is a big protection, we can say,

15:57.640 --> 16:04.040
a shield, from all kinds of evil that other’s
can put on you.

16:04.040 --> 16:08.170
Just forgive them, and then you see what happens
to them.

16:08.170 --> 16:15.910
You just try this trick: just forgive, and
see what happens to others who try to torture

16:15.910 --> 16:16.910
you.

16:16.910 --> 16:20.730
Of course, the Divine never wants to torture
anyone; that is definite.

16:20.730 --> 16:23.240
It never wants to torture.

16:23.240 --> 16:26.290
It is extremely generous, It likes to forgive.

16:26.290 --> 16:27.410
It enjoys Its forgiveness, It really enjoys.

16:27.410 --> 16:34.790
Generosity is to be enjoyed in the same way
forgiveness is to be enjoyed.

16:34.790 --> 16:36.589
It’s very enjoyable.

16:36.589 --> 16:43.510
When you forgive others it’s the most enjoyable
thing, that you see the play, you become the

16:43.510 --> 16:44.510
witness.

16:44.510 --> 16:50.490
So the Mahalakshmi tattwa, when it develops
into you: first of all you have to forgive

16:50.490 --> 16:57.460
if somebody has borrowed money from you and
has not returned — it doesn’t matter.

16:57.460 --> 17:04.360
It’s difficult for people to forgive people
who borrow money and don’t give.

17:04.360 --> 17:12.170
(laughter) And beyond that is also another
problem I have seen (laughing) that: if you

17:12.170 --> 17:16.130
lend some money to somebody, then run away
from that person.

17:16.130 --> 17:19.690
Because even to give is easier, but [to] take
is even worse.

17:19.690 --> 17:25.990
A person who takes money from you, will never
forgive you all your life, because you have

17:25.990 --> 17:29.150
lent money to him!

17:29.150 --> 17:34.420
So, one has to understand that, when you become
Divine, you just give.

17:34.420 --> 17:36.210
You just give.

17:36.210 --> 17:39.470
This is Mahalakshmi tattwa.

17:39.470 --> 17:43.540
Mahalakshmi tattwa is that you give.

17:43.540 --> 17:50.550
Don’t worry about what is the result, how
others react to it, what happens to it, what

17:50.550 --> 17:54.790
is the ultimate result, and what you achieve
out of it, and how the person has taken.

17:54.790 --> 17:55.790
Just give!

17:55.790 --> 17:57.190
That is Mahalakshmi tattwa.

17:57.190 --> 18:04.170
But when I say give, also you must use discretion.

18:04.170 --> 18:07.020
That is the part we always forget.

18:07.020 --> 18:14.510
Sahaja Yoga must teach you discretion, that
is the Divine truth.

18:14.510 --> 18:16.580
Divine is the most discreet thing.

18:16.580 --> 18:22.670
Now, when I say, “Give,” I know people
will just start running on the street, finding

18:22.670 --> 18:27.960
out somebody where you can give something!

18:27.960 --> 18:34.760
You don’t have to run about to find out
somebody that you should give something to

18:34.760 --> 18:36.850
someone: there’s no need.

18:36.850 --> 18:38.420
It’s just flowing.

18:38.420 --> 18:39.980
It’s just flowing.

18:39.980 --> 18:51.000
Whenever the chance is, just try to give:
material things, something kind words, sweetness,

18:51.000 --> 18:52.500
comfort.

18:52.500 --> 19:00.690
But never give one thing, which I sometimes
do by mistake: never give advice! (laughter)

19:00.690 --> 19:14.530
That’s a very dangerous thing.

19:14.530 --> 19:20.559
You can give bandhan, you can beat the person
at his back with shoes.

19:20.559 --> 19:25.280
But never give an advice in words.

19:25.280 --> 19:30.670
That is one of the principles of Sahaja Yoga,
for the time being.

19:30.670 --> 19:34.430
Because giving advice, you know what it means.

19:34.430 --> 19:36.990
You may have a boxed nose or something!

19:36.990 --> 19:40.410
It’s a very dangerous thing.

19:40.410 --> 19:46.880
So best is, on that part I would say, as far
as advice is concerned: you have so many ways

19:46.880 --> 19:49.280
and methods of handling a situation.

19:49.280 --> 19:54.350
So better not speak about it, just handle
it in complete silence.

19:54.350 --> 20:02.220
Whatever you have to do about a person, just
handle him without talking to that person.

20:02.220 --> 20:06.370
The more you try to convince the person, the
worse he will get.

20:06.370 --> 20:08.260
Because they are not Divine.

20:08.260 --> 20:11.200
They haven’t reached that Divinity.

20:11.200 --> 20:19.100
They are a special type of people who cannot
become Divine, and do not break your necks

20:19.100 --> 20:20.100
with them.

20:20.100 --> 20:23.370
Also don’t give advice to other Sahaja yogis.

20:23.370 --> 20:28.400
Everybody at this stage thinks that they know
all about Sahaja Yoga.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.840
It’s all right, good idea!

20:31.840 --> 20:33.900
Very good idea!

20:33.900 --> 20:40.820
But never try to tell them what they should
do, what is good for them, unless and until

20:40.820 --> 20:42.740
they come and ask.

20:42.740 --> 20:52.661
Now, this Mahalakshmi tattwa, when it grows
into collectivity: what happens [is] that

20:52.661 --> 20:57.270
you learn that you have to just give, and
you don’t worry about the receiving.

20:57.270 --> 21:01.500
As Krishna has said, “Karmanye vadhikaraste
phaleshou Ma kadachana” (meaning) “Our

21:01.500 --> 21:07.870
job is to do the karmas (the work) and we
are not to worry about the phalas (fruits)."

21:07.870 --> 21:16.360
Just try to give whatever is possible to everyone:
vibrations, Realisation.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.810
I know it is wasted so many times — you
give Realisation and it is wasted.

21:20.810 --> 21:23.330
It’s like the seeds that are thrown on the
rocks.

21:23.330 --> 21:26.020
Yes, I know, it is.

21:26.020 --> 21:31.820
So many times I have wasted thousands of them,
but doesn’t matter, you give them.

21:31.820 --> 21:35.950
It is not [that] you are giving them for their
sake, but for your sake.

21:35.950 --> 21:42.630
It is for your satisfaction you are doing
it, for your fondness you are doing it.

21:42.630 --> 21:49.130
So just try to give Realisation to everyone,
anyone who asks for it.

21:49.130 --> 21:54.290
But, as Christ has rightly said that, “Don’t
throw pearls before the swines."

21:54.290 --> 22:01.460
I mean, I shouldn’t use this word today,
on such an auspicious day, but doesn’t matter.

22:01.460 --> 22:03.770
So, this, He has said it.

22:03.770 --> 22:05.880
Now, this kind of people, who are they?

22:05.880 --> 22:09.880
They are the people who don’t deserve it.

22:09.880 --> 22:16.770
So there is no need to give Realisation to
every person you come across [or] talk to

22:16.770 --> 22:17.770
everyone.

22:17.770 --> 22:22.870
Gradually you will meet such people who will
ask for Sahaja Yoga, for Realisation: you’ll

22:22.870 --> 22:24.440
give it to them.

22:24.440 --> 22:33.530
Gradually those pigs, or what you call them,
whatever Christ has called them, they will

22:33.530 --> 22:38.210
evolve, I am sure, one day, and they’ll
come to you.

22:38.210 --> 22:47.470
So, let us try on the first level, where there
are genuine seekers of a high level, and you

22:47.470 --> 22:52.010
will be amazed how they are sorted out.

22:52.010 --> 22:57.430
You see, there isn’t much space in the Kingdom
of God, to be very frank.

22:57.430 --> 23:03.590
And we should not worry if we don’t have
many people over there.

23:03.590 --> 23:10.290
For us, it is a responsibility we must have
all the population of this world going up

23:10.290 --> 23:12.500
there: is a wrong idea.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.720
That’s not needed at all.

23:14.720 --> 23:16.300
We should not crowd them there.

23:16.300 --> 23:21.130
Here only, we can’t sit all of us you see,
we’ll have to have a bigger place.

23:21.130 --> 23:28.150
So we should not bother so much as to the
quantity, that the quantity is not much.

23:28.150 --> 23:32.750
Of course we should try our level best to
pass the message; Because they should not

23:32.750 --> 23:34.670
say that, “We didn’t get the message."

23:34.670 --> 23:36.230
To pass the message is all right.

23:36.230 --> 23:44.690
But we need not in any way force people or
ask them to come to Sahaja Yoga or make them

23:44.690 --> 23:45.690
Sahaja Yogis.

23:45.690 --> 23:46.690
It’s a difficult thing.

23:46.690 --> 23:49.650
The more you will try, the worse they will
be.

23:49.650 --> 23:56.560
They will be so troublesome that it’s going
to be an impossible task.

23:56.560 --> 24:04.640
So in your generosity you must have discretion:
how far to go with people, how far to work

24:04.640 --> 24:05.640
it out.

24:05.640 --> 24:13.280
This is the Mahalakshmi tattwa which comes
to you as a result of Shri Ganesha, who blesses

24:13.280 --> 24:20.210
you with wisdom as to how to be generous with
others, where to give, what to give.

24:20.210 --> 24:21.210
The discretion starts working.

24:21.210 --> 24:26.700
You don’t have to think about it, it just
works out.

24:26.700 --> 24:27.980
It will just work out.

24:27.980 --> 24:33.640
Discretion in Sahaja Yoga doesn’t mean,
at all, thinking or rationally coming to a

24:33.640 --> 24:39.301
conclusion, but it means that it just works
out that way: in the sense that you feel it

24:39.301 --> 24:40.400
in your vibratory awareness.

24:40.400 --> 24:54.130
Once such a discretion is developed, you will
be amazed that those who are not to enter

24:54.130 --> 24:59.650
into the Kingdom of God will just shun it,
will not come close to you.

24:59.650 --> 25:03.590
And it’s better for us, less headache, you
see.

25:03.590 --> 25:09.040
Because they think that we need them, while
they don’t know [that] they need Realisation,

25:09.040 --> 25:10.040
not we.

25:10.040 --> 25:11.750
We have got our Realisation.

25:11.750 --> 25:19.010
So this is about generosity, today, I wanted
to tell you; about being generous to Sahaja

25:19.010 --> 25:20.010
Yogis.

25:20.010 --> 25:25.300
Now, I’m not going to tell you that you
go on giving presents to Sahaja Yogis and

25:25.300 --> 25:29.560
all that, because, as you know that, these
material things have no value except they

25:29.560 --> 25:30.560
have symbolic value.

25:30.560 --> 25:38.680
And symbolically if you work for them, and
if symbolically if you try to express yourself,

25:38.680 --> 25:46.020
it is going to work out much better than in
a material way: that it should be so expensive,

25:46.020 --> 25:47.330
it should be so much.

25:47.330 --> 25:49.090
That’s not good.

25:49.090 --> 25:55.190
Symbolically you should work out material
gifts and things among yourselves.

25:55.190 --> 26:00.750
But the main thing one should understand [is]
that collectivity will only grow when you

26:00.750 --> 26:05.870
do not, by any of your attitude or behaviour,
suggest that others are lower than you or

26:05.870 --> 26:08.040
others are higher than you.

26:08.040 --> 26:17.760
For example, you see something straight, you
see quite far away; I see much more than what

26:17.760 --> 26:19.070
you can see.

26:19.070 --> 26:20.900
It’s a fact.

26:20.900 --> 26:21.900
You know that.

26:21.900 --> 26:22.900
But I don’t tell you.

26:22.900 --> 26:25.320
I just say, “I don’t know, maybe try this,
try that."

26:25.320 --> 26:27.030
I keep quiet.

26:27.030 --> 26:30.280
I just try to play about.

26:30.280 --> 26:31.280
I say, “All right.

26:31.280 --> 26:32.280
Let’s see."

26:32.280 --> 26:35.760
I’ll consult you, I’ll consult him, everybody
I’ll consult: “All right, try this."

26:35.760 --> 26:40.040
Or I’ll do all these tricks, because I don’t
want you to feel that, “Mother knows everything,

26:40.040 --> 26:41.620
so why should I know?”

26:41.620 --> 26:43.800
First of all you can say that.

26:43.800 --> 26:47.540
Or you may say that, “Mother knows so much,
and I know nothing.

26:47.540 --> 26:50.090
I can never reach Her."

26:50.090 --> 26:56.480
So, what you have to do is to make another
person see as much as you see.

26:56.480 --> 26:58.510
How will you do that?

26:58.510 --> 27:03.470
By being with him all the time, by being in
such a relationship that the other doesn’t

27:03.470 --> 27:14.030
feel the oppression: oppression of that personality,
as if that person [thinks], “Oh, he is so

27:14.030 --> 27:18.460
great, he is so great, he knows so many things,
and he’s so evolved.

27:18.460 --> 27:19.460
What are we?

27:19.460 --> 27:22.150
We are nothing!”

27:22.150 --> 27:29.860
If you develop such an attitude towards a
person, then the other person can also develop

27:29.860 --> 27:32.560
another attitude, just the other way round.

27:32.560 --> 27:36.670
That he’ll oppose such a person, he’ll
stand out, he’ll be angry all the time.

27:36.670 --> 27:41.480
At the slightest pretext, he’ll be off and
he’ll feel hurt and he’ll be miserable.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.520
All these things can come up.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.880
So it is not going to help you, nor the other
person.

27:46.880 --> 27:52.960
But to tell another person, if you want to
raise that person higher, the best thing is

27:52.960 --> 28:03.000
to make him your friend, your dearest person,
and let him see as much as you can see, together.

28:03.000 --> 28:07.420
Then the vision is broader.

28:07.420 --> 28:15.360
It’s not that one person sees something
more and others do not see, and the person

28:15.360 --> 28:19.630
who can see, thinks no end of himself.

28:19.630 --> 28:25.320
You should behave in such a manner as if you
don’t know anything, it’s better.

28:25.320 --> 28:27.830
You should see me, how I behave.

28:27.830 --> 28:31.530
I don’t tell you anything, I just say, “All
right, go ahead.

28:31.530 --> 28:33.250
Whatever you think proper, do it."

28:33.250 --> 28:34.570
Then you come round and you say, “Mother
but it happened like this, and you had told

28:34.570 --> 28:35.570
us this way!”

28:35.570 --> 28:41.280
So I say, “I told you, all right, but I
didn’t say, “All right, this is going

28:41.280 --> 28:42.280
to happen!’

28:42.280 --> 28:43.770
” But it happens.

28:43.770 --> 28:49.201
So it’s better that you should also develop
that kind of an attitude that, all of us have

28:49.201 --> 28:50.560
to go together.

28:50.560 --> 28:53.810
There’s nobody who can just pull out oneself
ahead.

28:53.810 --> 28:58.880
We all have to go together, even me.

28:58.880 --> 29:00.790
Even if I maybe anything, what does it matter?

29:00.790 --> 29:03.990
What does it matter if God is great?

29:03.990 --> 29:04.990
So what?

29:04.990 --> 29:08.450
He may be great in His own play.

29:08.450 --> 29:14.630
But what do we gain out of Him is the point
that, His greatness should be seen through

29:14.630 --> 29:15.630
us.

29:15.630 --> 29:19.170
If we cannot move up to that point, what’s
the use of His greatness?

29:19.170 --> 29:21.540
It’s better that He’s away.

29:21.540 --> 29:25.250
He’s too great for us.

29:25.250 --> 29:26.820
So He has to come down.

29:26.820 --> 29:33.150
He has to come down to this level to make
everybody feel that they are part and parcel

29:33.150 --> 29:34.470
of His own ignorance.

29:34.470 --> 29:37.440
He may be the most knowledgeable person, so
what?

29:37.440 --> 29:44.470
You have to take the cover of the ignorance
upon yourself and go on slowly exposing yourself.

29:44.470 --> 29:52.120
In the same way, if you can do it with other
Sahaja Yogis.

29:52.120 --> 29:59.690
Then only you could be good leaders, and you
have been really generous with a full discretion.

29:59.690 --> 30:08.190
So today’s day is, as I told you, the thirteenth
day is the Goddess.

30:08.190 --> 30:10.550
Dhanteras it is called as.

30:10.550 --> 30:13.580
That is the day of the Gruha Lakshmi; She
came as Gruha Lakshmi.

30:13.580 --> 30:23.840
In the household, the lady is the one who
is the symbol of that Lakshmi, to begin with.

30:23.840 --> 30:28.110
Because she’s the one who looks after your
food, looks after your comfort, she protects

30:28.110 --> 30:33.990
you, she nourishes you, she gives you joy.

30:33.990 --> 30:37.840
And the women who cannot do that are not Gruhalakshmis.

30:37.840 --> 30:42.670
They are not the…’housewife’ is a very
poor word for that.

30:42.670 --> 30:48.560
They are the Gruhalakshmis; means they are
the goddesses of the family.

30:48.560 --> 30:50.610
So, the other day we were in America.

30:50.610 --> 30:54.080
I told the girls, I said, “Let us wait.

30:54.080 --> 30:58.180
And what we can do: it’s all right, I am
the Mother; you can give me food if you want.

30:58.180 --> 31:01.160
But I don’t mind, give the boys first, and
then the girls should eat."

31:01.160 --> 31:03.560
And one of them got very angry with me.

31:03.560 --> 31:05.980
She said, “Mother what is this?

31:05.980 --> 31:07.090
They are dominating us!”

31:07.090 --> 31:10.260
If somebody eats before or later, what is
the domination?

31:10.260 --> 31:14.080
I mean, in any case you are going to eat before
or after!

31:14.080 --> 31:16.520
I don’t understand the portion of domination.

31:16.520 --> 31:18.690
But you are privileged!

31:18.690 --> 31:27.050
You are privileged that you can look after
so many people!

31:27.050 --> 31:28.710
What is so wrong in it?

31:28.710 --> 31:36.350
You see the whole atmosphere is so funny that
if the men eat first, then women should feel

31:36.350 --> 31:39.460
that we are put down.

31:39.460 --> 31:44.710
It’s absurd, because it’s a privilege:
you are like a mother.

31:44.710 --> 31:48.780
You are the person who has to look after them,
and you have to feed them.

31:48.780 --> 31:54.100
It’s a privilege that a Gruhalakshmi should
do that: look after everybody, give them food

31:54.100 --> 32:00.290
to eat and treat them just like their protégés
you can say, something like that.

32:00.290 --> 32:02.450
It’s such a privilege.

32:02.450 --> 32:05.740
It’s a sign of complete maturity.

32:05.740 --> 32:10.550
Even little, little girls, you have seen,
if they are brought up properly, otherwise

32:10.550 --> 32:11.580
they can be horrifying.

32:11.580 --> 32:15.790
But normally little girls are very generous,
more generous than men are.

32:15.790 --> 32:20.490
And they always try to make you very happy.

32:20.490 --> 32:23.690
They have great sense.

32:23.690 --> 32:27.280
If somebody is sitting down they’ll come
and give you food and look after you.

32:27.280 --> 32:31.750
I mean, I have seen my all three granddaughters,
do that.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.900
Even once a washerwoman came in the house.

32:33.900 --> 32:34.900
They said, “You must sit on the sofa."

32:34.900 --> 32:35.900
She said, “But no, I can’t.

32:35.900 --> 32:36.900
I can’t sit on the sofa."

32:36.900 --> 32:39.270
“No, you must sit on the sofa!” they said.

32:39.270 --> 32:44.530
They opened the fan for her and they brought
all the things that were in the kitchen for

32:44.530 --> 32:49.020
her to eat, now, and they brought some plate
and this and that.

32:49.020 --> 32:51.610
And the elder one, I told her, “What do
you want to be?”

32:51.610 --> 32:58.160
She said, “I can only be a nurse or an air
hostess."

32:58.160 --> 32:59.590
I said, “Why?

32:59.590 --> 33:01.980
Air hostess and nurse, why?”

33:01.980 --> 33:08.650
“Because these are the only two professions
where one can give, isn’t it, food."

33:08.650 --> 33:11.820
I mean it’s a privilege.

33:11.820 --> 33:15.860
Other professions you can’t do this great
job, this noble job, of giving food.

33:15.860 --> 33:22.980
“So that’s why I want to be either the
nurse or the air hostess."

33:22.980 --> 33:27.480
And they play, I have seen these girls play,
“Now I’m the air hostess, now.

33:27.480 --> 33:28.920
You must eat this!”

33:28.920 --> 33:34.080
They bring food in small, little things.

33:34.080 --> 33:37.300
They make their own things, “Now I’m the
air hostess,” and they’ll bring it.

33:37.300 --> 33:40.730
Now, there may not be any food in it, maybe
some stones they have put, or whatever it

33:40.730 --> 33:41.730
is.

33:41.730 --> 33:42.730
“You must eat!

33:42.730 --> 33:43.730
You must look after yourself!

33:43.730 --> 33:44.730
You are thinning down.

33:44.730 --> 33:45.730
You’d better."

33:45.730 --> 33:46.730
Like that: so sweet.

33:46.730 --> 33:50.460
And then they’ll bring some pillows, “Now
you must lie down."

33:50.460 --> 33:54.690
Like the air hostesses they are working, you
see, “Ah, are you feeling cold?

33:54.690 --> 33:56.530
Would you like to have a blanket or something?”

33:56.530 --> 33:58.510
I said, “What game is this?”

33:58.510 --> 34:01.330
“Now we are air hostesses!” (laughter)

34:01.330 --> 34:04.620
It’s such a privilege, an innocent privilege.

34:04.620 --> 34:11.830
And that’s what, if we develop, this nonsense
of a right that, “We are higher, they are

34:11.830 --> 34:14.490
lower,” all this nonsense will go away.

34:14.490 --> 34:16.170
Who is higher and lower?

34:16.170 --> 34:20.210
Like some hairs are here and some are here;
are they higher or lower?

34:20.210 --> 34:23.530
You can’t do without this or this!

34:23.530 --> 34:28.990
It is an absurd idea that has come into our
heads that we are higher or lower.

34:28.990 --> 34:36.370
So a gruhalakshmi is the one who has to be
a noble woman, has to be an example in the

34:36.370 --> 34:37.370
family.

34:37.370 --> 34:43.389
Like, if a housewife herself is a drunkard,
marries ten times, what will happen to her

34:43.389 --> 34:44.389
children?

34:44.389 --> 34:46.520
Just think of it, such a woman.

34:46.520 --> 34:56.159
A woman who has no sense of chastity, no sense
of auspiciousness, no sense of protection

34:56.159 --> 35:00.230
for them, what can she talk?

35:00.230 --> 35:01.760
Who is she?

35:01.760 --> 35:02.910
What does it matter?

35:02.910 --> 35:05.030
I mean what comfort can anybody give to a
housewife?

35:05.030 --> 35:09.840
She is the one who is the source of comfort;
what comfort can you give her?

35:09.840 --> 35:12.980
To her the greatest comfort is that you eat
your food properly, you sleep well, you keep

35:12.980 --> 35:15.580
well; that is the greatest comfort.

35:15.580 --> 35:28.000
So this is what one has to know: that gruhalakshmi
is the woman in the family, she is the gruhalakshmi.

35:28.000 --> 35:30.190
But the man should not be a wolf also.

35:30.190 --> 35:32.190
A gruhalakshmi cannot marry a wolf, you must
understand.

35:32.190 --> 35:40.300
If the man is a wolf, then he doesn’t deserve
to have a gruhalakshmi, but he can have a

35:40.300 --> 35:42.910
she-wolf as his wife; that’s a good idea.

35:42.910 --> 35:47.310
Then they can fight, quarrel, have all kinds
of divorces, this thing.

35:47.310 --> 35:50.950
But it’s the responsibility of the gruhalakshmi,
to begin with I must tell you.

35:50.950 --> 35:53.760
To keep the balance it is her duty.

35:53.760 --> 35:59.190
It is not the duty of the other people in
the family.

35:59.190 --> 36:01.100
It is she who keeps.

36:01.100 --> 36:02.280
She doesn’t give up at any cost.

36:02.280 --> 36:05.150
Of course, if he’s a wolf: all right, he
can go to the forest.

36:05.150 --> 36:07.250
She’s not bothered.

36:07.250 --> 36:14.220
But the men must understand [that] the more
you start respecting the housewife, the gruhalakshmi,

36:14.220 --> 36:21.180
in the family, the more there is respect,
the more there will be settling of these women

36:21.180 --> 36:28.460
in their proper places, becoming proud of
their houses and families and their own set

36:28.460 --> 36:29.630
up that they have put in.

36:29.630 --> 36:34.870
They’ll feel they’ll have a meaning, and
the whole society will change.

36:34.870 --> 36:39.510
But if the men run after dirty women and cheap
and street women, then the same housewives

36:39.510 --> 36:41.500
can take to that.

36:41.500 --> 36:51.990
So that is very important, that they must
be respected, because they are gruhalakshmis.

36:51.990 --> 36:53.590
That is one thing.

36:53.590 --> 37:00.390
The second thing is, they are also rajalakshmis.

37:00.390 --> 37:09.460
Rajalakshmis are the goddesses who are looking
after the country.

37:09.460 --> 37:12.980
Like England has a Rajalakshmi too.

37:12.980 --> 37:20.560
Now, we say, we can say, the princess now
(Princess Diana) is, she’s a rajalakshmi.

37:20.560 --> 37:23.770
She is a woman with dignity.

37:23.770 --> 37:26.380
She carries herself with that bashful sweetness
and all that, she’s a rajalakshmi.

37:26.380 --> 37:28.100
Our Queen is very good too.

37:28.100 --> 37:34.250
But, we can say, other people in the same
family are funny.

37:34.250 --> 37:39.480
They belong to Royal family [but] they haven’t
got that strength of character to belong to

37:39.480 --> 37:40.480
that.

37:40.480 --> 37:44.490
They have all the privileges, but they think
they have all the rights, but no duties.

37:44.490 --> 37:48.140
And as that also the rajalakshmi can be very
funny.

37:48.140 --> 37:53.550
Like in this country there has been curses
on curses, because of seven queens were murdered

37:53.550 --> 37:54.800
in this country.

37:54.800 --> 38:01.220
I mean, I can’t think of any country where
even one queen can be murdered by the king.

38:01.220 --> 38:05.320
This country has a very funny curse of these
seven women who were killed like this.

38:05.320 --> 38:11.700
I mean, what sort of women they must have
been, and what sort of queens they must have

38:11.700 --> 38:12.700
been?

38:12.700 --> 38:15.250
I mean, there’s nothing of a rajalakshmi.

38:15.250 --> 38:17.110
A rajalakshmi is a dignified woman.

38:17.110 --> 38:20.360
She is the one who is the glory of the country.

38:20.360 --> 38:22.630
She has to be a glorious woman.

38:22.630 --> 38:30.350
She has to be a woman with all the attributes
of a queen.

38:30.350 --> 38:35.330
And that is the Rajalakshmi: is the, is the
queen, or the goddess, that is the queen;

38:35.330 --> 38:40.180
and She resides in every country.

38:40.180 --> 38:46.040
Every country has a Gruhalakshmi, and if that
is insulted, then the people suffer.

38:46.040 --> 38:52.160
They will suffer in so many ways, like they
will have money problems, they’ll have financial

38:52.160 --> 38:55.700
problems, they’ll have also have problems
of society; all kinds.

38:55.700 --> 39:02.230
Because whatever the queen does, whatever
the king does, it is done by others; but specially

39:02.230 --> 39:03.230
the queen.

39:03.230 --> 39:08.780
Most of the fashions in England have come
because the queen started it.

39:08.780 --> 39:14.100
So whatever she does, she’s so important
and she has to have that idea in her that

39:14.100 --> 39:15.100
she’s the goddess.

39:15.100 --> 39:20.050
She has to represent that goddess which resides
in every country.

39:20.050 --> 39:21.380
So that is the Rajalakshmi.

39:21.380 --> 39:29.710
Now, in countries where there is no [monarch],
in democratic countries, then all right, then

39:29.710 --> 39:31.980
the first lady of the country should behave.

39:31.980 --> 39:38.240
Not like the American lady (Jackie Kennedy)
who married a tycoon somewhere, an old man,

39:38.240 --> 39:39.240
and is now a photographer!

39:39.240 --> 39:40.240
What is this?

39:40.240 --> 39:41.340
So cheap, it is so cheap!

39:41.340 --> 39:44.040
She doesn’t deserve to be there.

39:44.040 --> 39:46.280
There’s no dignity about her.

39:46.280 --> 39:49.430
She’s competing herself with cheap street
women.

39:49.430 --> 39:52.660
She should know that she is the first lady.

39:52.660 --> 39:59.510
In the countries where there is even, say,
not democracy, and other sorts of governments

39:59.510 --> 40:01.380
are there, there is also a first lady.

40:01.380 --> 40:06.380
And why now these first ladies also have become
competitors and they compete there with their

40:06.380 --> 40:07.580
husbands and try.

40:07.580 --> 40:12.120
Wherever they have tried such a trick: Even
Bandaranaike tried these things; she failed.

40:12.120 --> 40:17.670
Anywhere they tried to outwit their husbands
by this, they will failed, because God is

40:17.670 --> 40:19.210
not with them.

40:19.210 --> 40:23.500
They are there because they are first ladies,
and they should take all pride within themselves.

40:23.500 --> 40:26.330
Even if they feel they are a little bit let
down by people, not respected.

40:26.330 --> 40:29.940
But if she respects herself, nobody can be
disrespectful to her.

40:29.940 --> 40:32.740
She should keep her respect and everybody
will respect her.

40:32.740 --> 40:37.391
But just to punish people, if she has to behave
like this, that means she has no value of

40:37.391 --> 40:39.180
her own.

40:39.180 --> 40:43.740
So the first thing that one, Lakshmi, gives
you [is] the value system.

40:43.740 --> 40:46.780
Your value system is corrected.

40:46.780 --> 40:48.790
You evaluate yourself properly.

40:48.790 --> 40:53.920
Like, you know the value of this and value
of that and value of this.

40:53.920 --> 41:00.310
But the value system for a divine person is
not based on the amount of money or amount

41:00.310 --> 41:05.570
of matter it has, but it depends on what vibrations
it has.

41:05.570 --> 41:11.810
So the whole evaluation system changes when
you get into Divine temperament, that you

41:11.810 --> 41:13.520
start seeing things.

41:13.520 --> 41:20.130
What is precious is what has the maximum vibrations.

41:20.130 --> 41:32.280
Whatever has vibrations is the precious thing
for a realised-soul, and not what is not Divine.

41:32.280 --> 41:36.280
What is not Divine, we have nothing to do
with.

41:36.280 --> 41:45.840
But you will be amazed, whatever is Divine
is all very precious, also, otherwise.

41:45.840 --> 41:50.790
Like the paintings, which are done with Divinity
—means the realised-souls have done — are

41:50.790 --> 41:51.790
today very expensive.

41:51.790 --> 41:54.310
May not be in those days, but now, today.

41:54.310 --> 41:59.510
Actually all the truth comes up gradually,
and people can see that clearly, that there

41:59.510 --> 42:03.170
is something special about these things.

42:03.170 --> 42:06.920
So your value system changes as your Mahalakshmi
essence starts growing and manifesting.

42:06.920 --> 42:19.390
You stand absolutely open, and you find that
new things, new ideas, a new valuation of

42:19.390 --> 42:24.380
everything starts coming to you.

42:24.380 --> 42:34.690
Once this happens to you, know that you are
growing.

42:34.690 --> 42:40.790
You must know how to judge whether you are
growing or not.

42:40.790 --> 42:47.880
And that is how you will know that you are
growing in the right direction, if your value

42:47.880 --> 42:50.010
system is improving.

42:50.010 --> 42:54.250
Today’s day is the Lakshmi’s day.

42:54.250 --> 43:04.270
I bless you with all the Lakshmi’s powers.

43:04.270 --> 43:13.670
And specially the discretion to improve your
value system: what is more valuable to you,

43:13.670 --> 43:19.680
what is the most valuable thing to you; you
must try to revise that.

43:19.680 --> 43:30.730
Then there is, after this day, when they worship
the first day is, they say that, that is the

43:30.730 --> 43:32.890
day when Diwali was celebrated when Rama was
made the king.

43:32.890 --> 43:34.790
He killed Ravana on Dashera.

43:34.790 --> 43:40.990
And [it was] on this day that Rama was crowned,
and that’s why they celebrate it.

43:40.990 --> 43:45.160
Now, Rama is the person — at that time He
was crowned — He represents the Benevolent

43:45.160 --> 43:46.160
King.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.160
And the benevolence of a king is being crowned.

43:47.160 --> 43:48.160
So that’s why they celebrate Diwali.

43:48.160 --> 43:53.290
But we have a special significance of Diwali,
it’s a very special significance, I think:

43:53.290 --> 44:03.130
that the light, that we see here, you will
see it always goes upward.

44:03.130 --> 44:10.360
The fire is the element that always goes upward.

44:10.360 --> 44:17.120
It’s always against the gravity, and it
is against all that pulls you down.

44:17.120 --> 44:24.400
And the light of the Spirit is also like that,
it always takes you upward.

44:24.400 --> 44:33.190
And the person who is a realised-soul is called
as an enlightened person, because he has the

44:33.190 --> 44:34.610
light.

44:34.610 --> 44:40.770
And the light has a capacity to give you a
full idea, to see what is what, to relate

44:40.770 --> 44:45.910
to each other, to find out the distances,
and the differences, and to discriminate.

44:45.910 --> 44:50.529
So the light represents discrimination.

44:50.529 --> 44:58.740
And when you are enlightened, the Spirit is
enlightened: in the sense [that] Spirit is

44:58.740 --> 45:05.310
the light, but which starts expressing itself
in the atmosphere, manifesting in the attention

45:05.310 --> 45:07.610
of yours.

45:07.610 --> 45:12.170
Now, what we have done, in Sahaja Yoga, is
nothing but this is Diwali.

45:12.170 --> 45:19.131
First one light was enlightened, then that
light enlightened another light, and now we

45:19.131 --> 45:20.520
have so many lights.

45:20.520 --> 45:23.220
This is the Diwali that I have.

45:23.220 --> 45:26.000
I enjoy this Diwali [more] than anything else.

45:26.000 --> 45:29.120
Now some lights are really sometimes flickering,
I know that.

45:29.120 --> 45:30.120
Doesn’t matter.

45:30.120 --> 45:40.740
Some lights are afraid of the wind that might
affect it, so I have to look after them.

45:40.740 --> 45:45.930
In India you see this part is called as ‘achal
of the mother’, you see, where she keeps

45:45.930 --> 45:47.010
her child hidden.

45:47.010 --> 45:52.660
And this is where she looks after the candle
also, the light that she has kindled.

45:52.660 --> 45:58.050
And very carefully she looks after it and
tries to see again and again if it is burning

45:58.050 --> 45:59.050
or not.

45:59.050 --> 46:07.270
And when she is sure that it is burning nicely,
then she puts it on a higher place where it

46:07.270 --> 46:10.470
burns; not for itself but for others.

46:10.470 --> 46:17.370
It enlightens others and enlightens the path
of the people who are going in the darkness.

46:17.370 --> 46:22.890
So, for us, Sahaja Yoga today, is a Mahayoga,
because it is the Deepavali.

46:22.890 --> 46:29.770
It’s not only one deepa of your Mother burning,
but it’s so many lights all over the world.

46:29.770 --> 46:34.450
You know they have taken their light and they
are burning.

46:34.450 --> 46:36.380
Even small children are giving Realisation.

46:36.380 --> 46:43.590
It has spread to the villages now, and is
spreading slowly as the Diwali.

46:43.590 --> 46:47.900
And every day we celebrate Diwali we have
more and more lights.

46:47.900 --> 46:51.860
And I am sure these lights are going to grow.

46:51.860 --> 46:57.570
Those people, who still have flickering lights,
have problems, they always have problems,

46:57.570 --> 47:02.970
and they must know that their light is to
be brought in properly, into proper shape.

47:02.970 --> 47:09.420
They must put all attention to put their lights
in order.

47:09.420 --> 47:15.170
If your lights are ordered there cannot be
a problem, there cannot be a problem.

47:15.170 --> 47:22.180
So the correction is also a Divine quality
in you, which should work inward, by which

47:22.180 --> 47:23.830
you correct yourself.

47:23.830 --> 47:27.190
And the other day I was explaining how you
don’t have to think.

47:27.190 --> 47:28.190
It’s very simple.

47:28.190 --> 47:34.010
It’s a machinery, which is a Divine machinery,
which you have found out now, within yourself.

47:34.010 --> 47:38.980
Now at this time when you have got a machinery,
you don’t have to think about it.

47:38.980 --> 47:44.230
Because the machinery that is Divine, is just
like any other machinery.

47:44.230 --> 47:47.100
For example, you know the machinery of the
car, you don’t have to think.

47:47.100 --> 47:49.710
You don’t think, “I have to put a brake,”
you just put it.

47:49.710 --> 47:52.810
When you are a master driver, you just do
it, you don’t think.

47:52.810 --> 47:53.810
Do you think?

47:53.810 --> 47:56.950
If you start thinking, you will kill so many
people by that thinking!

47:56.950 --> 48:01.850
So in the same way, if you have mastered this
machinery: if you know which one to move,

48:01.850 --> 48:06.630
how to move, how to work it out, if you have
mastered it you don’t think about it and

48:06.630 --> 48:07.630
it just works.

48:07.630 --> 48:12.630
And that is what it is and we have to understand
that, after developing Mahalakshmi tattwa,

48:12.630 --> 48:19.370
which is the main tattwa, which is the evolutionary
principle by which you have evolved.

48:19.370 --> 48:26.110
It’s the ultimate, the Sushumna, the central
path, which is the most important.

48:26.110 --> 48:32.170
If the Sushumna is not all right, then you
cannot do anything, because there is the flow,

48:32.170 --> 48:40.890
there is the opening, which is important,
which makes you wider, which makes you deeper,

48:40.890 --> 48:44.240
which makes you greater.

48:44.240 --> 48:49.030
That is the path of Sushumna which must be
always kept open.

48:49.030 --> 48:57.470
You must try to keep it open: by balancing
yourself, by this generous attitude, and by

48:57.470 --> 49:01.360
seeing everything through your discretion.

49:01.360 --> 49:03.690
Keep it open.

49:03.690 --> 49:06.280
Keep your Sushumna open.

49:06.280 --> 49:09.290
And that is the path of Mahalakshmi.

49:09.290 --> 49:16.420
If you keep your Sushumna open there will
be no physical problems, no emotional problems,

49:16.420 --> 49:19.700
and of course no spiritual problems.

49:19.700 --> 49:22.910
That is how one has to understand today’s
Mahalakshmi tattwa.

49:22.910 --> 49:29.700
Now at this position when you reach, you see:
this position is very important at Mahalakshmi’s

49:29.700 --> 49:33.300
principle, is that it gives you the witness
state, no doubt.

49:33.300 --> 49:40.510
But as I have told you before, just after
this first day’s puja of the Lakshmi, when

49:40.510 --> 49:46.530
Rama was crowned, next day they have the second
day.

49:46.530 --> 49:55.230
And on this second day, you see the thirteenth
day, as I told you, is the day when the Lakshmi

49:55.230 --> 49:56.230
was born.

49:56.230 --> 49:59.570
Fourteenth day is a horrible thing, which
I do not want to tell you much about, because

49:59.570 --> 50:03.770
that is the day the Goddess had to fight all
the horrible rakshasas.

50:03.770 --> 50:09.600
So I don’t want to talk about it much because
you know all that.

50:09.600 --> 50:12.100
That is the fourteenth day.

50:12.100 --> 50:15.560
Then the fifteenth day is the day when the
moon is absolutely missing from everything.

50:15.560 --> 50:21.620
It’s absolute darkness, where you put these
lights to suggest that: there are lights now,

50:21.620 --> 50:24.570
let Lakshmi come within us.

50:24.570 --> 50:28.120
So there is no spot that should be left which
is dark.

50:28.120 --> 50:33.410
So everywhere the Lakshmi resides, and give
us the glory of Her blessings.

50:33.410 --> 50:42.710
Then it is the night when you have the dark
night, as you call it, amavasya.

50:42.710 --> 50:53.190
Then the first night after that, is the first
moon that the, you say the new moon.

50:53.190 --> 50:58.530
[When] the new moon comes up, the first day,
is the day when the New Year starts for Shalivahana.

50:58.530 --> 51:04.890
As you know, Shalivahanas are my ancestors,
or whatever you call it, the same Dynasty.

51:04.890 --> 51:06.990
That is the day.

51:06.990 --> 51:16.830
That day, they take a shawl, shawl of the
Mother, like this, and put this water carrier

51:16.830 --> 51:20.200
on top, to suggest the Aquarius time.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.550
The Aquarius time has started according to
them.

51:22.550 --> 51:29.490
They put that on top of that, and put it,
like a flag, on top of their houses to suggest

51:29.490 --> 51:31.330
now the Aquarius time is there.

51:31.330 --> 51:36.560
With the Mother’s shawl they made the flag.

51:36.560 --> 51:43.900
And on top of the flag is the water carrier,
is put upside down to suggest that the Aquarius

51:43.900 --> 51:50.360
time has started, that the time of Kundalini
has started, and that this awakening has to

51:50.360 --> 51:51.550
take place.

51:51.550 --> 51:56.520
That’s the first day of the year they start.

51:56.520 --> 52:02.970
Then after that, the second day is..so it
is five days actually; but why I said four

52:02.970 --> 52:07.210
days celebration is because one day is a horrid
day in between.

52:07.210 --> 52:12.220
But also there’s a celebration because,
after killing all these rakshasas, there were

52:12.220 --> 52:13.220
Diwali.

52:13.220 --> 52:18.950
Many a times these things happened, and every
time She killed all these rakshasas they celebrated

52:18.950 --> 52:21.330
it by putting lights all around.

52:21.330 --> 52:28.180
So after that is the second day, is very important,
which is here: is the brother and sister’s

52:28.180 --> 52:32.210
special day, where the sister invites the
brother to her house for food.

52:32.210 --> 52:36.740
And if he’s a small boy she will give him
a bath.

52:36.740 --> 52:44.630
Even if he is a big boy he sits with all his
clothes on and she puts water on him and puts

52:44.630 --> 52:47.590
something, very fragrant things, on his body
and gives him a bath nicely and gives him

52:47.590 --> 52:48.590
a protection.

52:48.590 --> 52:58.060
It’s a purity of relationship between
a sister and a brother.

52:58.060 --> 53:04.890
And then the brother gives her something as
a present at that time.

53:04.890 --> 53:07.840
And he may give anything: it’s just symbolic.

53:07.840 --> 53:15.920
It’s the love and affection of a brother
and sister [which] is expressed at that time.

53:15.920 --> 53:18.090
It’s very important.

53:18.090 --> 53:21.510
And then the sister, actually gives him a
bandhan, with actual light, which we call

53:21.510 --> 53:23.440
as the aarti they do for the brother.

53:23.440 --> 53:24.440
And that’s how they try to give a big protection
to their brother.

53:24.440 --> 53:27.420
So this is the day, they call it in Marathi
‘Bhaubeej’ or ‘Bhaiyadweej’: that

53:27.420 --> 53:28.420
is the dwitya, the second day of the moon.

53:28.420 --> 53:29.650
That is done in India.

53:29.650 --> 53:41.930
Now it has significance because it is very
important that our relationship as a brother

53:41.930 --> 53:47.100
and a sister must be strengthened, must be
purified, must be looked after.

53:47.100 --> 53:52.000
In India, even if somebody calls you a sister
or a brother, then he is a sister or a brother.

53:52.000 --> 53:53.000
It’s a very difficult situation.

53:53.000 --> 53:57.410
If somebody calls you a sister, then you have
to accept that situation.

53:57.410 --> 54:02.550
And if you accept that situation, all your
life you have to carry on that relationship

54:02.550 --> 54:03.550
of that nobility.

54:03.550 --> 54:05.810
Whether he may be your brother or not, doesn’t
matter.

54:05.810 --> 54:07.900
She may your sister or not, does not matter.

54:07.900 --> 54:10.600
But once you have said she is your sister,
then all that purity is there, all her chastity

54:10.600 --> 54:14.890
is to be protected, and she is to be looked
after.

54:14.890 --> 54:19.270
So this is how it is.

54:19.270 --> 54:23.290
These are the five days they celebrate.

54:23.290 --> 54:25.560
In short I have told you, how we Sahaja yogis
should understand, these five days are days

54:25.560 --> 54:32.790
of real festival for us because we have overcome
death now, we have overcome that degradation

54:32.790 --> 54:34.640
that would have followed after it.

54:34.640 --> 54:38.820
Now we are people who are victorious.

54:38.820 --> 54:47.140
So this is to celebrate our victory over evil,
our victory over our weaknesses, and our victory

54:47.140 --> 54:53.560
towards the goal of our achievement — that
is full Self-realisation.

54:53.560 --> 54:56.900
And that’s how it’s a great day of celebration,
and may God bless you all.

54:56.900 --> 55:04.670
And in this jubilation I join you all, and
I am very happy that we are so many today

55:04.670 --> 55:14.770
in this country, and a day will come when
we, our righteousness and our greatness will

55:14.770 --> 55:28.470
definitely enhance the path of darkness with
this light, and improve the conditions, to

55:28.470 --> 55:29.990
such an extent that people won’t believe
that they were living in this wretched world,

55:29.990 --> 55:30.990
and today they are in such a beautiful world.

55:30.990 --> 55:31.990
They won’t believe.

55:31.990 --> 55:32.990
It will happen.

55:32.990 --> 55:33.990
As it has happened within yourself it will
happen without.

55:33.990 --> 55:36.040
And that’s what is the day I am waiting
for, when such things will happen.

55:36.040 --> 55:41.400
And all these things we are doing here, leading
a very righteous and a good life now, with

55:41.400 --> 55:44.130
forgiveness for others and with all the generosity:
it will became a universal truth for people.

55:44.130 --> 55:50.240
And when this will become a universal happening,
and when people will universally accept Sahaja

55:50.240 --> 55:54.910
Yoga, then will be the real days of Diwali’s
celebration.

55:54.910 --> 55:56.480
May God bless you all.

55:56.480 --> 55:58.680
So I must say, for Christmas I won’t be
here.

55:58.680 --> 55:59.680
I’ll be in India.

55:59.680 --> 56:03.630
It’s nice way, you know, because I’ll
escape all your presents! (laughter) You gave

56:03.630 --> 56:11.220
me so many presents last time that it was
too much for me.

56:11.220 --> 56:29.070
Of course if you say that, I gave you, because
that’s of course is nothing great because,

56:29.070 --> 56:37.070
you see, if you give to one person, it is
too much to carry.

56:37.070 --> 56:47.030
They say you have to have a shipload.

56:47.030 --> 56:51.520
And if one person gives to so many, it’s
not such a difficult thing, isn’t it.

56:51.520 --> 56:54.450
But if everybody gives to one person it’s
too much.

56:54.450 --> 56:59.630
And if one person gives to many it’s very
good because the load is lessened on everyone

56:59.630 --> 57:03.140
and also shared, of that one person.

57:03.140 --> 57:08.850
So my giving was a better thing than your
giving to me, because I was really thinking

57:08.850 --> 57:16.630
of taking a ship, to put all the nice presents
you gave me.

57:16.630 --> 57:32.130
So, do you have any questions?

57:32.130 --> 58:14.020
So, now, just, this is your ring.

58:14.020 --> 58:27.100
Kay, here’s the ring.

58:27.100 --> 58:29.880
Simon, come along!

58:29.880 --> 58:39.500
So, you see, today’s puja is more sort of
asking for the expansion, expansion of your

58:39.500 --> 58:41.530
Sushumna; more that.

58:41.530 --> 58:50.960
So as it is, when we are doing this puja,
first of all you must develop a mood of forgiving

58:50.960 --> 58:57.950
others, and forgiving yourself also; just
that mood, first of all, to improve your Sushumna

58:57.950 --> 59:00.770
further to grow, first of all.

59:00.770 --> 59:06.260
So there’s a mantra for that, “Ya Devi
Sarvabhuteshu kshama rupena samsthitah."

59:06.260 --> 59:07.600
All right?

59:07.600 --> 59:10.280
And, “Shanti ripen samstitah."

59:10.280 --> 59:22.920
All these mantras, if you say, all of you,
if you say these mantras: one you can say

59:22.920 --> 59:27.220
and they can repeat you.

59:27.220 --> 59:35.900
And then that will definitely improve.

59:35.900 --> 59:39.140
These are all mantras for the Sushumna.

59:39.140 --> 59:50.740
I think you people don’t have any machine,
a grinding machine in the thing.

59:50.740 --> 59:51.740
So I had better pay for that machine.

59:51.740 --> 59:54.920
Because I would like to give some present
to the ashram.

59:54.920 --> 59:57.930
And what do you call that machine for grinding
something?

59:57.930 --> 59:58.960
Yogi: A grinder, Shri Mataji.

59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.410
Shri Mataji: Become something greater and
higher.

01:00:00.410 --> 01:00:00.990
That’s the point is.
