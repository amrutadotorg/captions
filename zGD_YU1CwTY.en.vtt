WEBVTT

08:41.760 --> 08:44.480
Please be seated.

09:07.960 --> 09:12.360
Hello, so we were waiting for you to come.

09:12.560 --> 09:13.800
So, I think, get My sweater.

09:14.000 --> 09:18.840
Hello, we were waiting for you to come, for Christopher to come here.

09:19.080 --> 09:24.160
How is he? Very good. What's happened to his head?

09:25.920 --> 09:29.000
Changing of milk Shri Mother.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.760
So Christopher you are back, here?

09:41.160 --> 09:45.760
You must cover his head. It's very cold still.

09:46.200 --> 09:50.320
All right. All right. All right.

09:52.280 --> 09:55.640
What's the matter?

10:10.760 --> 10:14.960
He is in meditation.

10:22.040 --> 10:25.200
You must keep him close, all the time.

10:25.400 --> 10:27.920
Better cover him more.

10:28.160 --> 10:30.240
No, get something more from inside.

10:30.440 --> 10:32.720
I think you also wear your sweater or something.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.720
It's rather cold outside.

10:34.920 --> 10:38.000
Cover him much more on the head.

10:38.480 --> 10:42.480
SY: This is a present from the Austrian Sahaja Yogis.

10:42.680 --> 10:48.280
Austrian Sahaja Yogis to the French Sahaja Yogis.

10:56.080 --> 10:59.720
It's beautiful.

11:05.760 --> 11:10.920
“And I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse”.

11:11.120 --> 11:14.480
SM: Translate in French.

11:21.160 --> 11:24.080
At last I also bring My sweater. Jenny you can bring.

11:24.320 --> 11:27.800
Sweater for Shri Mataji.

11:32.640 --> 11:36.680
SY: Mother I have a gift, two gifts for you.

11:39.120 --> 11:42.520
First from Rouen we offer You the [unclear]

11:42.720 --> 11:45.880
where You meet us Saturday.

11:46.760 --> 11:49.480
And the armour of the town.

11:49.760 --> 11:52.440
SM: Oh, I see.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.680
SY: The blazon of the town of Rouen.

11:56.960 --> 12:01.040
SM: What's that? SY: The blazon of the city, of Rouen.

12:01.240 --> 12:02.760
SM: And what are these marks about?

12:02.960 --> 12:06.880
SY: Three lilies. SM: Lilies?

12:07.120 --> 12:12.640
SY: I think it's like a lotus in France, in old kingdom.

12:12.840 --> 12:17.000
SM: Beautiful. Thank you very much.

12:21.960 --> 12:24.840
Can you keep it?

12:29.560 --> 12:35.160
It's quite cold today. The wind will blow away the clouds.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.480
As soon as I came out here.

12:38.720 --> 12:43.000
It plays, you see it plays some tricks with you all the time.

12:47.920 --> 12:52.680
Yes, better have him covered. And you too wear something warm.

12:53.440 --> 12:56.720
I hope you are all warm enough.

13:42.560 --> 13:48.200
I am so happy and joyous

13:48.400 --> 13:52.640
to be here with so many Sahaja Yogis,

13:52.840 --> 13:56.880
and so many of them are very new...

13:57.520 --> 13:59.680
not very new to Me,

13:59.880 --> 14:03.120
perhaps I have known all of you,

14:03.920 --> 14:06.920
thousands of years back.

15:06.080 --> 15:09.080
You are sitting in the sun.

15:21.440 --> 15:29.840
In Sahaja Yoga you all have to understand one simple thing —

15:33.560 --> 15:37.560
that you are the spirit.

15:41.400 --> 15:45.160
And whatever is not the spirit

15:45.360 --> 15:48.360
is not yourself.

15:53.680 --> 15:57.440
We can compare spirit with the sun.

15:59.560 --> 16:04.520
The sun can be covered with the clouds,

16:07.080 --> 16:13.480
there could be superimpositions on the sun,

16:16.040 --> 16:21.160
but sun remains as it is, at its point.

16:24.120 --> 16:28.120
You cannot enlighten the sun.

16:30.080 --> 16:33.520
It is illumined by itself.

16:36.480 --> 16:40.000
Now, when the clouds are removed,

16:40.200 --> 16:43.640
the superimpositions are removed,

16:48.880 --> 16:53.120
the sun shines through the atmosphere.

16:55.560 --> 17:00.160
So, our spirit is also

17:00.720 --> 17:10.880
is superimposed by ignorance.

17:20.200 --> 17:24.240
As long as there is superimposition,

17:24.440 --> 17:27.440
you can't see the spirit.

17:31.360 --> 17:35.560
And even when few clouds disappear

17:40.640 --> 17:45.520
the superimposition exists.

17:47.560 --> 17:50.000
One has to have a clear sky

17:50.200 --> 17:56.720
to see the light of the spirit shining through.

18:01.240 --> 18:08.920
There are many ways by which we can try to remove the clouds.

18:16.240 --> 18:21.600
The first and the foremost thing is the assumption, the faith

18:21.800 --> 18:25.080
that you are the spirit

18:32.160 --> 18:36.640
and that the rest is superimposition.

18:38.640 --> 18:43.360
You have to assume that within yourself —

18:46.720 --> 18:51.000
after Realization it should become very easy —

18:53.560 --> 18:57.040
that you are something much more,

18:59.840 --> 19:02.880
something very different

19:03.880 --> 19:07.480
from what you have known so far.

19:11.800 --> 19:20.160
So, now the new situation arises —

19:26.160 --> 19:30.000
that you do not have a blind faith,

19:32.560 --> 19:40.160
but you have a faith that has come out of an experience.

19:43.360 --> 19:47.400
So your intellect should not fight it.

19:51.600 --> 19:54.760
It should not try to challenge it.

19:59.200 --> 20:03.040
If it challenges and if you're ill to your intellect,

20:03.240 --> 20:06.240
you'll again go down.

20:14.720 --> 20:21.400
Even if you get the glimpse of a star in the sky,

20:27.920 --> 20:33.480
then the scientists believe that there is a star.

20:39.800 --> 20:41.480
So, in the same manner,

20:41.680 --> 20:46.560
even if you get the glimpse of your Realization,

20:53.120 --> 20:58.800
you have to at least believe that you are also a spirit.

21:02.800 --> 21:09.440
You go on sticking on to that experience

21:11.720 --> 21:15.600
and keeping your attention on the fact

21:15.800 --> 21:19.400
that you are the spirit.

21:23.360 --> 21:28.280
Tell your intellect not to cheat you anymore.

21:36.240 --> 21:42.280
You can turn the face of your intellect by this.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.920
Now your intellect will start working

21:49.160 --> 21:54.200
for the pursuit of the spirit.

21:57.680 --> 22:01.040
This is what faith means.

22:02.600 --> 22:07.520
Faith gives rise to pure intelligence.

22:13.560 --> 22:22.920
Now, when you are seeing clouds removed to a great extent,

22:23.160 --> 22:26.440
still there are clouds.

22:37.160 --> 22:40.560
So you have to use the wind

22:42.400 --> 22:46.160
to remove the clouds.

22:46.480 --> 22:49.560
Wind of the Holy Ghost.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.280
And that... you know,

22:52.480 --> 22:59.640
there are many ways of taking advantage of the wind.

23:17.280 --> 23:20.680
I hope the Italians understand.

23:34.560 --> 23:40.840
So the wind comes from some other source,

23:50.440 --> 23:54.920
that is the source of the Holy Ghost, your own Kundalini.

23:59.760 --> 24:07.320
And also you have in person the Primordial Kundalini before you.

24:17.920 --> 24:22.720
Compared to many other seekers who came before you,

24:22.920 --> 24:26.400
I must say, you are very fortunate.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.000
Because worshipping any vigraha,

24:39.200 --> 24:48.000
any... even a statue of

24:49.480 --> 24:54.320
self-created vibrations from the Mother Earth,

24:54.520 --> 24:57.640
people had big problems.

25:12.320 --> 25:16.920
They had to, first of all, do a meditation

25:17.160 --> 25:21.280
which was called as Savikalpa Samadhi.

25:26.760 --> 25:28.920
That means, in that state

25:29.160 --> 25:34.600
you had to concentrate on such a statue, vigraha.

25:34.800 --> 25:40.440
Vigraha means the one which is a vibrating statue.

25:45.240 --> 25:49.280
And then, go on looking at that statue

25:49.480 --> 25:54.240
and trying to raise your Kundalini.

26:00.880 --> 26:05.920
And Kundalini used to come up to Agnya.

26:09.240 --> 26:16.320
But the jumping beyond the Sahasrara was an impossible task,

26:21.880 --> 26:27.080
because one had to go from form to formless,

26:32.080 --> 26:37.880
and it was so difficult, to get out of form to formless.

26:43.400 --> 26:50.000
And even to concentrate on abstract or formless

26:50.200 --> 26:52.080
was another impossible task

26:52.280 --> 26:57.160
as the Muslim did, or many other people tried to do.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.520
Under these circumstances

27:16.360 --> 27:21.680
it was necessary that the formless had to take a form,

27:26.360 --> 27:29.880
so there was no more complication to you.

27:31.240 --> 27:38.480
As soon as you concentrated on the form,

27:38.680 --> 27:41.680
you became formless.

27:46.880 --> 27:51.760
Like if you have ice before you,

27:55.240 --> 28:00.240
and as soon as you start touching the ice, it melts away,

28:03.840 --> 28:06.920
and you start feeling the cool.

28:08.680 --> 28:12.800
So the problem is very easily solved now.

28:16.840 --> 28:18.560
Puja is one of the things

28:18.760 --> 28:26.600
by which you can excite the forms into formless.

28:37.920 --> 28:42.560
Now, your centers are the centers of energies.

28:45.200 --> 28:52.880
But they, too, have a guiding deity sitting on all these chakras.

29:00.280 --> 29:04.680
They are also the formless made into forms.

29:08.840 --> 29:11.360
And when you do the puja,

29:11.560 --> 29:16.360
the forms melt into formless energy,

29:23.400 --> 29:27.720
and this formless energy then starts flowing,

29:34.440 --> 29:38.440
and that, then blows the wind.

29:42.280 --> 29:45.240
And that's how this misidentification,

29:45.440 --> 29:50.000
superimpositions on the spirit are removed.

30:01.160 --> 30:04.920
Now, you cannot think about the puja.

30:07.560 --> 30:13.320
The whole thing happens in a realm which is beyond thinking.

30:18.120 --> 30:21.240
So, you have to understand

30:21.440 --> 30:26.120
that you cannot rationalize the puja.

30:29.800 --> 30:35.880
You should have the maximum advantage

30:41.160 --> 30:44.160
on your chakras.

30:46.680 --> 30:54.640
For that you must fully just concentrate on the puja

30:54.840 --> 30:59.240
and how the wind is blowing.

31:04.640 --> 31:07.080
And the wind will see to it,

31:07.280 --> 31:11.600
that they drive out all the clouds.

31:18.000 --> 31:22.760
So your only work is,

31:23.000 --> 31:25.640
or your only method is —

31:25.840 --> 31:31.320
just to concentrate on the puja, and witness.

31:37.400 --> 31:40.480
You are a seer.

31:42.080 --> 31:45.120
Seer has double meaning.

31:47.200 --> 31:50.520
The one who sees only,

31:52.280 --> 31:55.280
just sees,

31:56.560 --> 31:59.880
and is only knowledge —

32:01.080 --> 32:04.080
is a seer.

32:04.760 --> 32:08.720
Without any thought, without any reaction,

32:10.920 --> 32:14.200
just sees and absorb,

32:14.680 --> 32:18.280
automatically, spontaneously —

32:20.200 --> 32:23.600
is the seer.

32:25.400 --> 32:32.480
And so, that is the best way to perform a puja.

32:35.840 --> 32:42.080
For Me sometimes it's burdensome,

32:46.840 --> 32:54.040
because there should be some parity between you and the deities.

32:58.720 --> 33:01.720
Some balance must be there.

33:03.560 --> 33:07.120
Here you are saying all the mantras and the deities are awakened,

33:07.320 --> 33:08.840
and there you are,

33:09.080 --> 33:14.080
who do not want to receive anything within your heart.

33:29.200 --> 33:32.040
So I am the one who has to store up

33:32.240 --> 33:36.800
all the extra energy that is produced in the body.

33:45.320 --> 33:50.920
So it would be better if you all keep your hearts open

33:51.160 --> 33:55.800
and watch the puja without thinking about it.

34:07.680 --> 34:12.680
Today we'll reverse the method of puja.

34:15.200 --> 34:19.680
First we'll do the havana and then the puja, will be better.

34:23.320 --> 34:30.240
Because by that we'll evoke the fire element,

34:34.720 --> 34:41.480
which burns away all the evils.

34:45.680 --> 34:49.680
When you wash My feet, you do the same thing.

34:51.760 --> 34:58.120
And even when you evoke the fire, you do the same thing.

35:00.600 --> 35:03.520
So today first we'll have the havana

35:03.720 --> 35:07.320
and then we'll have the puja.

35:11.520 --> 35:14.520
Both are just the same.

35:15.720 --> 35:20.320
You can worship Me with water or with fire.

35:22.480 --> 35:27.840
The essence of fire is the glow, tejas.

35:32.800 --> 35:37.120
All that is wrong, all that is evil is burned out,

35:37.320 --> 35:46.800
and then the glow shows on the faces and the body of the seekers.

36:02.600 --> 36:06.160
And also atmosphere is charged

36:06.360 --> 36:10.760
with the beautiful vibrations

36:11.000 --> 36:14.480
when you have the havana.

36:19.680 --> 36:24.000
So I think best thing will be to do the havan first

36:24.200 --> 36:28.600
and then the puja.

36:32.680 --> 36:35.680
May God bless you all!

36:43.640 --> 36:49.400
Of course always we have to praise Ganesha before starting any puja,

36:49.600 --> 36:54.320
so you start praising Shri Ganesha.

37:08.360 --> 37:13.400
SY: Mother, we have learned the Ganesha Atharva Shersha.

37:13.600 --> 37:17.200
Atharva... Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.

37:17.400 --> 37:20.280
YOGI: Then we'll say [UNCLEAR] in French, or in English [UNCLEAR], as You like.

37:20.480 --> 37:23.520
All right, say it in French.

37:26.880 --> 37:30.320
Or better to translate it because there are other people.

37:30.520 --> 37:32.920
First English and then French.

37:33.120 --> 37:35.360
And first, Sanskrit we can say, Mother.

37:35.560 --> 37:39.480
It's all right, I can understand English all right.

37:39.680 --> 37:43.680
Is all mantras for Me to understand.

38:06.440 --> 38:10.840
The holy mantras of Shri Mataji.

50:47.440 --> 50:52.160
Beautiful. [UNCLEAR] beautiful.

50:52.360 --> 50:54.160
It’s good.

50:54.440 --> 50:59.560
All right. And now we'll be having the fire. It's all right.

51:14.280 --> 51:18.560
Come along. You can look after the fire.

51:18.760 --> 51:22.160
Let others see the fire.

51:35.400 --> 51:41.520
SY: Mother, [first should] we recite Your names or names of Shri Vishnu?

51:45.040 --> 51:46.640
SY: Vishnu, Vishnu’s names?SM: Yes, Vishnu’s names.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.720
SY: 108 names of Vishnu?

51:48.920 --> 51:52.480
SM: It would be better I think His names.Have you got 1000 names?

51:52.680 --> 51:55.720
SY: Not, 108 names.

52:01.880 --> 52:04.480
SY: 108. Mother is asking for 1000.

52:04.680 --> 52:07.520
We have LalitaSahasranama.

52:07.720 --> 52:11.200
SM: But who knows Sanskrit?It’s in Hindi?SY: It’s written in French.

52:11.400 --> 52:14.440
SM: All right, then it’s all right.

52:14.640 --> 52:16.360
SY: The vibrated coconut.

52:16.560 --> 52:22.320
Now you put some water in it and [PUT?] it to all the people, now.

52:23.160 --> 52:31.160
Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me,

52:31.360 --> 52:34.360
from all these places,

52:34.560 --> 52:40.560
one from each center should come forward.

53:16.400 --> 53:18.800
One from Bretagne.

53:22.640 --> 53:25.640
These are too big, I think.

53:29.120 --> 53:35.040
You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, around it.
00:53:38:14 The bigger ones. Maria?

53:44.400 --> 53:47.600
The triangle [ON] the three sides.

53:59.200 --> 54:02.720
One on top of another, this be better.

54:03.880 --> 54:07.600
Yes, it’s closer, yes, that’s why.

54:08.320 --> 54:12.560
SY: Would You like some tea? Or… Mother, water. You don’t want water?

54:13.120 --> 54:14.160
Yes, Mother.

54:14.360 --> 54:19.560
[UNCLEAR]. Something like a...

54:20.040 --> 54:25.080
[UNCLEAR] paper like a... thing, something lighter...

54:27.840 --> 54:30.840
Is that the light thing?

54:31.160 --> 54:35.000
And have you got camphor with you?

54:39.000 --> 54:43.000
Something lighter to be, underneath.

54:43.280 --> 54:47.280
Do you have anything [UNCLEAR]?

54:47.760 --> 54:50.640
Make it smaller, smaller. Yes.

54:50.840 --> 54:54.040
Put it on top of this thing, not underneath.

54:54.240 --> 54:57.440
Not underneath, put it on top. Covering this.

54:57.640 --> 55:01.480
Yes, put these... on top.

55:01.880 --> 55:05.360
Yes, like that, yes, that's the right thing.

55:18.760 --> 55:22.880
You have to keep a hole in between.

55:23.760 --> 55:28.600
Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the center.

55:31.760 --> 55:33.840
Now arrange on top of this.

55:34.080 --> 55:38.120
No, this is all right. Please cover with this thing.

55:59.240 --> 56:03.360
I think there should be a platform first.

56:03.560 --> 56:05.520
There should be a platform first — and then.

56:05.720 --> 56:08.920
In the center there should be a platform.

56:14.480 --> 56:18.600
Yes, make a platform there, yes, down here.

56:20.280 --> 56:22.360
And on the platform,... just wait...

56:22.560 --> 56:26.200
Marcus, on the platform you put another thing.

56:27.320 --> 56:30.320
That's better, yeah.

56:31.840 --> 56:34.840
Do you have some more with you?

56:38.440 --> 56:41.440
[UNCLEAR]

56:44.560 --> 56:47.640
To begin with that's sufficient.

57:15.040 --> 57:18.880
SY: Mother we have Vishnu SahasranamaStotram and Shri Lalita.

57:19.080 --> 57:20.200
SM: But it should be in Sanskrit.

57:20.400 --> 57:24.920
SY: Now there is, also here it’s written in…

57:25.120 --> 57:28.520
SM: You can read that. SY: Yes.

57:28.720 --> 57:31.800
This is Vishnu’s names?

57:32.360 --> 57:34.560
You'd like to do 108 names, would you?

57:34.760 --> 57:38.360
What we do, we can do 108 of the Goddess

57:38.560 --> 57:40.280
and 108 of Shri Vishnu, that's the best.

57:40.480 --> 57:43.240
SY: All right, Mother. All right.

57:54.800 --> 57:57.240
SM: And one from Paris also.

57:57.680 --> 58:00.560
A new person.

58:01.560 --> 58:05.200
SY: Patrice, Patrice is from Paris.

58:33.280 --> 58:37.160
SM: Children, please... Keep the children outside.

58:38.560 --> 58:45.000
Mother, we read the 108 names translated in French in the form of a poem.

58:56.640 --> 58:58.960
Now, can you put something for Me there?

58:59.160 --> 59:03.640
SY: You want to sit here, on the chair?

59:08.480 --> 59:11.800
SM: Some chair.

59:21.160 --> 59:24.880
Vanessa you come here. You come and sit here,this side.

59:28.720 --> 59:32.560
You come this side. All the children can sit next to Me.

59:52.520 --> 59:56.480
Shall we say the mantra for the fire, Mother?

59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.680
We have to say together Shri Agni Devata, who is the Devi...

01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:04.560
Be careful about it. Don’t be too near. Little far away.

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:08.600
It’s moving in all the directions.

01:00:09.840 --> 01:00:10.960
Now say the mantra.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.840
Shri Agni Devata who is a Devi,

01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:16.360
the aspect of fire in Shri Mataji.

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:46.800
Shri SwahaSwamini who is a principle of...

01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:55.480
SM: I don’t know. How? What is the...? SY: SwahaSwamini.

01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.840
Swa-ha. Swaha is the quality of the... of the fire

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:01.080
which consumes everything. Swa-ha.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:39.440
Now, after every name that he takes

01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.480
you have to take the thing from your hand like this,

01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.720
and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire.

01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:52.360
But those who haven't got these things in the hand

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.440
should take up just their hand like that,

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.920
thinking that they have it in their hand,

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:03.200
and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:19.480
And you all should say "Swaha".

01:02:23.920 --> 01:02:28.760
Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name.

01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:36.520
SY: The 108 names of Shri Vishnu. Yes, Mother, it’s all right?

01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:40.920
SM: First the Devi. SY: First the Devi.

01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:18.880
Now we'll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight.

01:18:19.120 --> 01:18:23.480
Again you distribute the [nuclear], distribute it.

01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:45.920
What’s the time now?

01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:49.360
SY: The time? It’s 2o’clock.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:57.160
We have only to be at6.30 here to[entice] later on.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.880
But You don’t need to be there as early. We can arrive before you and give a practical session to the people.

01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.120
SM: You see these people who want to meet are always[barking], always.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:20.320
SY: Yes, that’s true.SM: One fellow has got back pain.

01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.040
SY: Yes, that thing like that. SM: He’s the only one who had.

01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:26.920
You bring the oil and all that and you can massage him.

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.760
SY: Yes, all right. We’ll give him a treatment.

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:33.120
No problem. I think we can manage.

01:19:43.720 --> 01:19:46.680
Some people can go there and give them a practical session Mother.

01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:50.840
how to meditate in Sahaja Yoga, how to work on themselves...

01:19:51.040 --> 01:19:53.440
SM: So I said, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient..

01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:56.120
SY: It’s all right, Mother. O.k.

01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:49.760
Now the... first you [UNCLEAR] this, finish it [INAUDIBLE].

01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:53.040
For that you have to use some sort of a fruit.

01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:56.080
Last thing. Do you have something?

01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:59.040
What is the special fruit of France?

01:23:59.240 --> 01:24:01.840
YOGI: The special fruit of France? Apples!

01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.560
SHRI MATAJI: Apples, or you should have...

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:07.560
YOGI: Stem berries... cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother!

01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:10.520
SHRI MATAJI: Grape is the best.

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.400
YOGI: [UNCLEAR] just to bless it, Mother.

01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:15.360
SY: Just to bless it, Mother. SM: That’s the reason.

01:24:34.400 --> 01:24:37.480
SM: You bring it here, bring it here.

01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:46.680
SHRI MATAJI: So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now.

01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:56.040
This is the end of the puja, is finished, throw all that in there.

01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:00.120
All the... all the remaining things are to be thrown.

01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.920
Yes, put it.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:26.400
Now, we have put today the grapes in it.

01:25:28.400 --> 01:25:33.800
That means the grapes will loose their capacity to ferment.

01:25:53.560 --> 01:25:56.560
That's the best.

01:26:04.240 --> 01:26:05.800
It's a big wind blowing!

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:12.800
So let’s then have our lunch and do the Puja inside as outside it’s very cold.

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:26.040
The main thing [UNCLEAR].

01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.840
[UNCLEAR] [Hindi].

01:26:38.080 --> 01:26:41.120
YOGI: Mother, the dinner is not ready... the lunch is not ready.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:42.200
SHRI MATAJI: Not ready, is it?

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.120
YOGI: Not, yes. In one hour, in one hour.

01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.320
SHRI MATAJI: So, we'll finish the puja?
