00:00.450 --> 00:05.640
Please sit very comfortably that’s very
important.

00:05.640 --> 00:11.219
There should be no strain on a particular
part of the body.

00:11.219 --> 00:17.500
For example, when you are sitting sometimes
your feet might feel little bit numbed down,

00:17.500 --> 00:19.540
you can change the posture.

00:19.540 --> 00:25.930
You need not carry on with any extreme effort
or any discomfort to yourself, that’s first

00:25.930 --> 00:27.230
thing you must remember.

00:27.230 --> 00:35.140
Moreover some of the people go into tense
postures also by stretching their hands too

00:35.140 --> 00:41.990
straight or sometimes going very straight
or pushing their head behind.

00:41.990 --> 00:48.210
Sometimes they bend their heads also bit too
much also.

00:48.210 --> 00:53.329
Sit very comfortably with both the hands on
your lap in a very comfortable way.

00:53.329 --> 01:01.010
There should be nothing extreme to be done
from outside.

01:01.010 --> 01:07.549
We have to understand the principle of this
living process.

01:07.549 --> 01:15.979
Then you will know that why I say: “No use
doing any such extreme thing to achieve your

01:15.979 --> 01:17.469
goal”.

01:17.469 --> 01:29.579
The principle is like this: that this room
is all dirty supposing or it’s in a chaos,

01:29.579 --> 01:33.570
or maybe it’s in darkness completely, you
can’t see anything.

01:33.570 --> 01:36.109
So you enter inside the room.

01:36.109 --> 01:42.310
Your goal is to achieve the enlightenment.

01:42.310 --> 01:51.079
Some people will say that: “Let us clean
the room in darkness with blindness”.

01:51.079 --> 01:58.920
You start cleaning your body you don’t know
what you are cleaning!

01:58.920 --> 02:03.009
So there is no need to bother about cleaning
when you are blind.

02:03.009 --> 02:11.510
Some people think: “If you clear your mind
before Realization you will be better off."

02:11.510 --> 02:17.490
You have tried all those things, but in doing
so, you have gone to extremes.

02:17.490 --> 02:24.799
It’s all blindness, all your work is done
in darkness, there is no enlightenment.

02:24.799 --> 02:32.000
You have to get your enlightenment first,
this is what I have realized that unless and

02:32.000 --> 02:36.910
until human beings are enlightened they cannot
cleanse themselves properly, they cannot understand

02:36.910 --> 02:43.730
Sahaja Yoga, they cannot understand God, they
cannot understand feel their Spirit, nothing

02:43.730 --> 02:46.239
is possible unless and until they are enlightened.

02:46.239 --> 02:54.629
It is possible then, when you get the enlightenment,
you might find that the light is not coming

02:54.629 --> 03:01.359
through properly, there is some shaking in
the bulb or may be there is some shaking in

03:01.359 --> 03:08.189
the shade or maybe that the room is dirty,
that you cannot see things clearly, that you

03:08.189 --> 03:11.709
cannot see your image in the mirror, your
eyes are weak.

03:11.709 --> 03:15.379
For all this you need a bright light.

03:15.379 --> 03:23.900
But without getting the light itself, without
knowing something about what you have got

03:23.900 --> 03:28.739
within yourself, how are you going to cleanse
yourself?

03:28.739 --> 03:35.220
Of course the light may be dim but still you
can see what is the problem, what is to be

03:35.220 --> 03:38.630
done, what is to be cleared out.

03:38.630 --> 03:41.010
That’s why enlightenment is the first thing.

03:41.010 --> 03:44.930
Now for this, even if you clean the whole
room, even if you do all that, you have not

03:44.930 --> 03:46.799
done the perfect job.

03:46.799 --> 03:51.769
On the contrary you might break some things,
you might spoil some things, you may slip

03:51.769 --> 03:58.109
down, anything can happen in darkness that’s
what happens to people when they do any sadhana

03:58.109 --> 03:59.109
blindly.

03:59.109 --> 04:04.209
After your enlightenment you know your way
through, you know how to go about it and you

04:04.209 --> 04:05.319
understand everything.

04:05.319 --> 04:13.920
Then another myth we have is that if we cleanse
our mind, we can achieve our spirituality,

04:13.920 --> 04:14.920
you can’t.

04:14.920 --> 04:18.412
Even if this room may be clean unless and
until there is light there cannot be enlightenment.

04:18.412 --> 04:22.370
So the main thing is you have to have an enlightenment.

04:22.370 --> 04:26.530
I have known people who lead very clean and
a good life.

04:26.530 --> 04:33.352
When they get enlightenment they get it very
fast and have it nicely established, very

04:33.352 --> 04:34.640
easily and it is there.

04:34.640 --> 04:42.010
But some of the people who lead a very clean
and a good life have overdone it to such an

04:42.010 --> 04:44.860
extent that they have an ego about it, they
think: “I don’t want anything, I am perfect,

04:44.860 --> 04:50.370
I do no wrong, I am committing no problem,
I am a very happy person”.

04:50.370 --> 04:55.570
Such people also get stuck because they do
not want the higher things of life.

04:55.570 --> 05:02.030
They do not want their Spirit to be enlightened
so that also sometimes become a very sticky

05:02.030 --> 05:03.030
point.

05:03.030 --> 05:10.250
Now in Sahaja Yoga, you have to know that
you have the power within yourself.

05:10.250 --> 05:15.690
It is there, it exists there, and it is to
be just awakened.

05:15.690 --> 05:19.860
In some people, it takes time to be awakened.

05:19.860 --> 05:24.030
In thousands I have seen it takes no time.

05:24.030 --> 05:29.590
The only thing that I would suggest is to
keep your mind open, not to become obstinate

05:29.590 --> 05:30.590
about things.

05:30.590 --> 05:34.810
If you are an obstinate person, the Kundalini
is even a greater obstinate thing.

05:34.810 --> 05:42.100
Do not be obstinate, just keep yourself open,
do not argue it out by argument or by thinking

05:42.100 --> 05:44.310
about it, the Kundalini is not going to be
awakened.

05:44.310 --> 05:49.290
On the contrary when the Kundalini is awakened
your thoughts settle down to such an extent

05:49.290 --> 05:54.160
that you feel there is no thought coming to
you from your subconscious or from your supraconscious.

05:54.160 --> 06:03.210
So try to keep yourself absolutely open and
don’t worry even if your vibrations are

06:03.210 --> 06:04.560
not felt.

06:04.560 --> 06:09.690
The principle is that light is light and the
room is room.

06:09.690 --> 06:12.530
The light has nothing to do with the room.

06:12.530 --> 06:18.910
Only thing, when the light is enlightened,
it enlightens the room.

06:18.910 --> 06:23.620
The room has something to do with the light,
but the light has nothing to do: whether the

06:23.620 --> 06:25.850
room is there or not, light exists.

06:25.850 --> 06:31.970
In the same way, we must understand that the
relationship with the atman and our body our

06:31.970 --> 06:35.360
Spirit and our this body, mind, and our ego,
superego.

06:35.360 --> 06:44.170
So many of
you must have done lot of tapasyas and lot

06:44.170 --> 06:50.340
of things which were not really wanted, thinking
that you have done such a lot, you have been

06:50.340 --> 06:53.530
to so many places, you have done so much “tirtha
yatra” [acetic; journey] you have been to

06:53.530 --> 06:58.750
so many pilgrimages and those pilgrimages
and all these places, you think according

06:58.750 --> 07:02.100
to you, it should be blissful to you.

07:02.100 --> 07:09.220
But actually, while going there, you did not
know how to get the bliss from those temple

07:09.220 --> 07:15.320
and those places which are holy actually in
nature but are surrounded by people who are

07:15.320 --> 07:16.320
extremely negative.

07:16.320 --> 07:20.630
Because of that, that mixture was there and
sometimes instead of getting the bliss you

07:20.630 --> 07:23.470
get the headaches.

07:23.470 --> 07:26.120
7:23

07:26.120 --> 07:43.780
Today we are going to discuss the Void what
we call Void in Sahaja Yoga is different from

07:43.780 --> 07:45.490
the way people talk of void.

07:45.490 --> 07:54.310
Void is the complete visceral cavity which
is called in Sahaja Yoga language as Bhavasagara.

07:54.310 --> 08:06.500
Many a times, you must have heard people singing
songs poets singing songs saying “Bhavasagara

08:06.500 --> 08:10.640
se para utaru”
What is this Bhavasagara?

08:10.640 --> 08:23.500
This is the symbol or this is the reflection
of the whole entire universe that is created.

08:23.500 --> 08:29.540
This all universe is created by Brahmadeva.

08:29.540 --> 08:37.530
He is the one who is the creator, who is a
“raksna yeta” [unsure] of this world,

08:37.530 --> 08:42.780
who created this beautiful universe, in that
especially he created the Mother earth.

08:42.780 --> 08:51.820
He has placed the Moon and the Sun on both
the sides of this Mother earth and the representatives

08:51.820 --> 08:57.030
of the Mother earth within us is the Kundalini,
the Mooladhara.

08:57.030 --> 09:12.260
Now this universe exists within us, that
is the Bhavasagara.

09:12.260 --> 09:17.730
This Bhavasagara exists in many stages in
its evolutionary form and today it is Kali

09:17.730 --> 09:21.570
Yuga in this Bhavasagara.

09:21.570 --> 09:28.060
I would say it is the dawn of Satya Yuga and
the end of Kali Yuga.

09:28.060 --> 09:37.170
And this Bhavasagara is placed in the centre-
is the center of Nabhi, Nabhi charka.

09:37.170 --> 09:41.240
And around it, moves the center of Swadhisthana.

09:41.240 --> 09:51.980
Nabhi chakra as you know is governed by Shri
Lakshmi as the power of Shri Vishnu and the

09:51.980 --> 10:03.240
Swadhisthana moves around it, which delimits
our own personality, and which creates all

10:03.240 --> 10:09.370
these different stars within us or the planets
within us.

10:09.370 --> 10:29.490
In these spaces, Void, are born the incarnations
of the Primordial Master who is called as

10:29.490 --> 10:30.490
Dattatreya.

10:30.490 --> 10:40.220
Dattatreya is the innocence of Shiva of – “Vibrations
itni hai ikura” [Vibrations are so cool]-

10:40.220 --> 10:45.710
of Brahmadeva and of Shri Vishnu.

10:45.710 --> 10:58.680
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, the essence of these,
the innocence of these is embodied in the

10:58.680 --> 11:03.650
form of Dattatreya, who is the Primordial
Master.

11:03.650 --> 11:18.450
So these masters who are born on this Earth
are innocence at its best, all integrated

11:18.450 --> 11:19.450
together.

11:19.450 --> 11:24.920
These masters have incarnated on this Earth
mainly ten times, but there have been many

11:24.920 --> 11:28.960
others incarnations also, there have been
repetitions just to correct themselves.

11:28.960 --> 11:36.310
As I told you yesterday that Mohammad Saab
and Nanaka are both the same personalities

11:36.310 --> 11:37.370
of Dattatreya.

11:37.370 --> 11:46.840
The instance is given, in the life of Guru
Nanaka, when he was sleeping people told him

11:46.840 --> 11:49.960
that your feet are towards Mecca, Kaaba towards
Kaaba.

11:49.960 --> 11:54.020
He said: “Alright I’ll remove my feet
and put wherever you say”.

11:54.020 --> 12:01.750
Then they put his feet towards the other side
and again they found that his feet were facing

12:01.750 --> 12:02.750
towards Kaaba.

12:02.750 --> 12:07.050
Then he said: “Tell me the place where there
is no Kaaba I’ll put my feet!”

12:07.050 --> 12:13.430
But they couldn’t arrange it at all, because
wherever he placed his feet, it was such a

12:13.430 --> 12:17.130
Maya, that always they found that the feet
were towards Kaaba.

12:17.130 --> 12:26.100
Now Kaaba is a place where you have a beautiful
Shiva linga, which is called as Macceshwarshiv

12:26.100 --> 12:28.000
Shiva in our Puranas.

12:28.000 --> 12:36.180
From ancient times it is mentioned that, there
is a pinda which is absolutely Vibrating and

12:36.180 --> 12:37.690
which is there.

12:37.690 --> 12:42.020
Now Mohammad Saab religiously avoided talking
about that.

12:42.020 --> 12:47.089
He only said: “If this stone can be so godly,
why not human beings be?”

12:47.089 --> 12:54.370
But he did not explained much as it is whatever
he tried to explain, the people were so insensitive

12:54.370 --> 13:00.770
and so cruel that they tried to kill him many
a times, they to gave him poison, ultimately

13:00.770 --> 13:03.760
he died in a very, very bad state.

13:03.760 --> 13:09.830
They tortured his life, they were lunatic
people, they used to live in tribes and very

13:09.830 --> 13:11.089
tribal by nature.

13:11.089 --> 13:17.779
And they- he tried his level best to propagate
that there is God and God is above all and

13:17.779 --> 13:22.770
I am the messenger of God, but they would
not listen to him.

13:22.770 --> 13:32.110
Then came, you know Nanaka who preached that
there should be no enmity between Hindus and

13:32.110 --> 13:36.810
Muslims, he preached that, because he saw
the Muslims behaving in such a manner, they

13:36.810 --> 13:40.130
were such fanatics and they had become so
funny that he could not understand how is

13:40.130 --> 13:41.130
it?

13:41.130 --> 13:44.410
These are the people whom I have made Muslims
and what are they doing here?

13:44.410 --> 13:51.510
Actually Musalman means the person who is
realized and Peer is a person whose realization

13:51.510 --> 13:57.050
is established so much so that he said that
those who have become Musalman should be buried

13:57.050 --> 14:02.160
and not burnt, because he thought they are
all realized souls, but realization finished

14:02.160 --> 14:08.820
off with his son in law and his daughter,
after that he had two sons who were great

14:08.820 --> 14:11.310
souls who are really the reincarnations of
Lov and Kush.

14:11.310 --> 14:15.560
Now perhaps we do not know what happened to
Luv and Kush when they were born.

14:15.560 --> 14:20.960
Luv and Kush when their mother disappeared
in the Mother Earth and the father, they were

14:20.960 --> 14:28.230
little annoyed with them, went in the North
one went to Caucasus and another went to China.

14:28.230 --> 14:35.230
Luv went to Caucasus and from there he became
a very powerful king in Russia.

14:35.230 --> 14:40.110
Russians always use Sanskrit language; we
do not know how much Sanskrit they use; for

14:40.110 --> 14:46.990
example they will say kharoshou means Harushivaye
the Pravada itself the word Pravada vda is

14:46.990 --> 14:51.470
to say pra means enlightened.

14:51.470 --> 14:55.480
You see their language, it’s full of Sanskrit
words, practically it is absolutely based

14:55.480 --> 15:00.750
on Sanskrit and you’d say slaws people…slaws,
so lov sla…

15:00.750 --> 15:08.010
Luv ruled there for years together and about
four hundred years back, his very descendants

15:08.010 --> 15:15.740
flew away from there, went to Iran, where
there is a Goddess, Goddess Hindolika’s

15:15.740 --> 15:20.500
temple is there which is all described in
the Puranas, where they used to worship Goddess

15:20.500 --> 15:25.730
Hindolika, from there they came down and spread
all over, it’s a big story.

15:25.730 --> 15:31.360
Then Kush went to China, that’s how you
have Kushan in China and Chinese language

15:31.360 --> 15:37.860
is very much near Sanskrit and quite close
to Marathi language, it’s more surprising

15:37.860 --> 15:43.899
if you hear them talking, for example they
say; Ma tza tum , tza is only there in Marathi

15:43.899 --> 15:48.000
language they use this word tza, we never
say in Hindi tza or in any other language

15:48.000 --> 15:52.959
you wont find it tza but only in Chinese and
in Marathi language they have this word, tza.

15:52.959 --> 16:00.100
It’s very interesting to see, how the spirituality
has spread into these countries and then how

16:00.100 --> 16:01.290
it died out.

16:01.290 --> 16:10.520
All these things happened, but then they were
born again and again, they were born as Mahavira

16:10.520 --> 16:19.370
and Buddha, they are the same, they are born
as Markendeya, they are born as Kabira, as

16:19.370 --> 16:24.990
Adishankaracharya, it was Buddha who was born
as Adishankaracharya just to correct himself,

16:24.990 --> 16:30.810
Buddha was shocked the way people were going,
there was Nirakara that he had be born as

16:30.810 --> 16:33.760
Shankaracharaya to tell people, oh God, what
are you doing?

16:33.760 --> 16:39.930
It was only Buddha who came to correct himself
as Shankaracharaya, it is so surprising, that

16:39.930 --> 16:47.740
people are fighting, Buddhist and Hindus are
great enemies of each other, but they do not

16:47.740 --> 16:54.640
know that the person who really re-established
Hinduism was the same who established Buddhism.

16:54.640 --> 17:01.300
So imagine the same personality coming again
and again on this Earth tries to correct his

17:01.300 --> 17:08.789
disciples again finds that there are two groups
he has created, it’s a big problem.

17:08.789 --> 17:16.149
Now Mahavira also was one of them, who was
born again and again and he was Markendeya

17:16.149 --> 17:22.699
and he was Kabira, the way Kabira lashes people
you can see that he is tremendous, he is like

17:22.699 --> 17:27.999
Bhairava and the power of Bhairava, Kabira
has used in his language, but for Hindi poets

17:27.999 --> 17:30.080
it is Sadhukadi and they have made fun of
it.

17:30.080 --> 17:36.059
The best thing of a person who doesn’t want
to face reality, is to make fun of everyone,

17:36.059 --> 17:39.220
that is the best way, they said what is this
talk Ida, Pingla, Sushumna?

17:39.220 --> 17:40.220
Who is he?

17:40.220 --> 17:41.330
What does he think of himself?

17:41.330 --> 17:46.650
But he was appreciated very much, by the saints
and especially by Guru Nanaka, who included

17:46.650 --> 17:51.669
all his poetry in his Grantha sahib; he’s
included so many of these poetry from all

17:51.669 --> 17:54.330
the realized souls from Maharashtra, also.

17:54.330 --> 18:00.389
But I wonder how many Sikhs know that this
was for getting realization, he thought, if

18:00.389 --> 18:03.980
you write an Upanishad, [not clear_] they
try to correct everything just to make people

18:03.980 --> 18:06.749
understand that you have to get to it.

18:06.749 --> 18:10.669
First, they thought that if you write Gita,
they go on remembering Gita by heart.

18:10.669 --> 18:15.519
Then, they thought it is better, that you
write something from the realized souls only

18:15.519 --> 18:19.460
together, so that it is a powerful Grantha
by which people when they read it they get

18:19.460 --> 18:24.119
Vibrations and they’ll stick to it, but
it is not so, even there people are just reading

18:24.119 --> 18:25.119
it.

18:25.119 --> 18:26.119
I don’t know how?

18:26.119 --> 18:29.210
Gradually as we were revolving, we were losing
our sensitivity.

18:29.210 --> 18:33.210
At least in the time of Rama, people knew
he was an incarnation.

18:33.210 --> 18:36.789
At the time of Krishna they knew he was an
incarnation.

18:36.789 --> 18:40.940
Many people know, of course, Raksasha knew
also that they were incarnations; raksasha’s

18:40.940 --> 18:46.309
even today know who the incarnation they are
very sure of it and they are just frightened

18:46.309 --> 18:51.029
of, but in those days, even common people
knew who is an incarnation.

18:51.029 --> 18:57.899
Now the sensitivity among human beings started
getting reduced and reduced as they got involved

18:57.899 --> 19:04.030
into fanaticism, all kinds of tantrism that
developed in this country of ours, in other

19:04.030 --> 19:09.200
countries also, tremendous movement was there
to create fanatics and these fanatics are

19:09.200 --> 19:14.980
diseased people, they are diseased, they are
actually the people who are possessed absolutely

19:14.980 --> 19:19.399
possessed, they are not normal people when
they talk, you are surprised, how can they

19:19.399 --> 19:20.990
talk like that?

19:20.990 --> 19:25.860
When they do not know anything about it, but
thank God today, fanaticism has reached such

19:25.860 --> 19:30.789
a stage that the younger people are understanding
the nonsense of it.

19:30.789 --> 19:34.999
It’s a very good chance for Sahaja Yoga
to come up.

19:34.999 --> 19:42.019
In Sahaja Yoga, the beauty is this, that you
cannot now form a cult as soon as you try

19:42.019 --> 19:48.259
to do such a thing, you loose your vibrations,
you try any such tricks, you try to be fanatic

19:48.259 --> 19:56.980
you will be losing all your vibrations, any
tricks you try with Sahaja Yoga first thing

19:56.980 --> 20:00.860
you will loose your vibrations, you wont like
it, you won’t be happy with it, you would

20:00.860 --> 20:08.279
like to keep your vibrations going, smooth,
smoothly and nicely so that you feel absolutely

20:08.279 --> 20:14.000
happy about it and joyous, but anybody who
tries any tricks with Sahaja Yoga, you get

20:14.000 --> 20:15.000
into problem.

20:15.000 --> 20:21.730
Now these Gurus came on this Earth to remove
fanaticism, the last of them came as Shirdi

20:21.730 --> 20:28.900
Sai Nath, he was the one who had said very
clearly, in Marathi he had said it, that to

20:28.900 --> 20:36.970
speak ill of any other religion is sin, is
sin, nothing can be more powerful than that.

20:36.970 --> 20:40.600
There are many people who worship Sai Nath,
many people, but they drink, he was against

20:40.600 --> 20:45.980
drinking, all of them were against drinking,
why were they against drinking because the

20:45.980 --> 20:48.570
awareness is spread in your void.

20:48.570 --> 20:57.720
The awareness, the Chitta, the attention is
in your void and is nourished by your liver.

20:57.720 --> 21:03.200
The liver takes out all the poison from your
awareness, due to bad health, due to bad mind,

21:03.200 --> 21:09.359
due to anything from bad effects or negativity
and then it clears out as I told you yesterday.

21:09.359 --> 21:15.119
So this awareness within us gets, you know
that our awareness, human awareness goes down

21:15.119 --> 21:18.809
through drinking, these people preach that
you should not drink.

21:18.809 --> 21:22.549
I mean that the one thing that they all preached
together, that you should not drink.

21:22.549 --> 21:27.019
At the time of Mohammad Saab there was no
smoking, so Guru Nanaka also [not clear] this

21:27.019 --> 21:32.139
time you found people smoking with big big
hookah’s, he said that now for heaven sake

21:32.139 --> 21:37.830
do not smoke, because they said that you just
said that don’t drink, so we will smoke

21:37.830 --> 21:38.830
now.

21:38.830 --> 21:42.109
Like in England, people say what’s wrong
in drugs?

21:42.109 --> 21:49.539
Drugs were not approached by saints, so we
can take drugs, so it is in my lot, to tell

21:49.539 --> 21:54.190
them, now drugs are the same; anything that
goes against awareness is not good.

21:54.190 --> 21:59.909
I mean, it is not something that you have
said no because they were mad people, whatever

21:59.909 --> 22:03.940
they said, they said because it was the truth.

22:03.940 --> 22:09.929
If you take drinks of any kind, alcoholics
or any these kinds, anything that takes you

22:09.929 --> 22:16.639
away from your awareness is wrong because
your awareness is to be enlightened as it

22:16.639 --> 22:24.049
is your awareness is like that and on top
of that if this awareness is to be enlightened

22:24.049 --> 22:27.000
and is full of alcoholism, how to raise it?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.009
How to do it?

22:28.009 --> 22:32.679
But these days to talk against alcoholism,
one person asked Me, “Mother are you going

22:32.679 --> 22:34.859
to be minister of permission?”

22:34.859 --> 22:41.580
I mean, it is impossible to talk to people
about anything sensible.

22:41.580 --> 22:45.169
Even in a party you go, they say why don’t
you drink?

22:45.169 --> 22:48.749
You should drink, you are missing such a great
thing, you have missed such a lot in your

22:48.749 --> 22:53.299
life, I said I have drunk from my childhood,
don’t give Me anything I don’t need it,

22:53.299 --> 22:56.230
no, they’ll go on forcing, you must drink.

22:56.230 --> 22:59.390
You see, this is a special thing, that is
thing and all that.

22:59.390 --> 23:01.760
They have no shame about it, no shame.

23:01.760 --> 23:07.059
They think they are trying to be nice and
you tell them even once if you say.

23:07.059 --> 23:08.830
Why do you drink?

23:08.830 --> 23:11.650
Gone, you are the gone case, you have no manners.

23:11.650 --> 23:12.669
You are the most unmannerly person.

23:12.669 --> 23:14.480
How dare you say such a thing to anyone?

23:14.480 --> 23:20.890
Look at these human beings, such [not clear_],
I don’t know how to deal with them?

23:20.890 --> 23:26.710
They think that they should be told, “alright
go ahead drink, kill your self”.

23:26.710 --> 23:28.730
How can you be saints allowed you to drink?

23:28.730 --> 23:32.720
Tell Me, when they know that it goes against
your awareness, of course these thugs will

23:32.720 --> 23:37.240
say “alright drink as much as you like,
do what you please, you have ten wives or

23:37.240 --> 23:43.460
you do what you please, only give me your
purse to me”, because that is their interest

23:43.460 --> 23:44.460
in you.

23:44.460 --> 23:47.529
They are only interested in your purse, how
much money you have got in your purse?

23:47.529 --> 23:49.190
What job you are doing?

23:49.190 --> 23:57.929
Or at times they can be, officers, saying
that, give job to my son or give job to someone.

23:57.929 --> 24:07.249
One has to understand that saint is not afraid
of anyone, he cannot be, it’s a fearless

24:07.249 --> 24:13.519
entity absolutely fearless, it’s not afraid
of anyone because it is standing on truth,

24:13.519 --> 24:20.789
truth itself gives you that strength to say
the truth, but I have learnt certain lessons,

24:20.789 --> 24:25.090
in my past lives that human beings don’t
like truth, don’t tell them, if you tell

24:25.090 --> 24:26.090
them they will crucify you, immediately.

24:26.090 --> 24:31.629
You have to go round and round and put them
into problem so that they come along.

24:31.629 --> 24:36.700
If you tell them straight forward don’t
do something, they will put you, I mean, people

24:36.700 --> 24:41.649
may crucify Me after sometime, if I tell them
don’t drink, it is that bad these days.

24:41.649 --> 24:48.320
The drinking in England is so bad now that
English, who used to drink so little, is now

24:48.320 --> 24:51.190
nothing but a bottle, since morning he starts
it.

24:51.190 --> 24:55.090
In third generation you go down, what about
our Indians who have gone there?

24:55.090 --> 24:59.720
Even the Sikhs, who are told not to drink,
drink more than Scotch people can drink.

24:59.720 --> 25:03.700
It’s a shameful thing and they will fight
that we’ll not put a helmet on our head,

25:03.700 --> 25:06.090
to save our head from going on a motorbike.

25:06.090 --> 25:10.019
Is it written in any Grantha Sahib like this
to be foolish and stupid?

25:10.019 --> 25:14.799
But they will fight for that, but not fight
for this, that no Sikh should drink.

25:14.799 --> 25:19.419
If you are wearing that pagadi, you have no
business to drink.

25:19.419 --> 25:24.239
They don’t think that the essence of religion
is more important, than all these nonsensical

25:24.239 --> 25:26.559
things that you think you are doing.

25:26.559 --> 25:33.779
Such a great religion, Islam, such a great
religion is Sikhism, such a great religion

25:33.779 --> 25:36.720
is Hinduism, such a great religion is Christianity.

25:36.720 --> 25:41.119
Everything gone to dogs because the dogs have
come into it.

25:41.119 --> 25:45.690
They have no sense of proportion; they do
not know how to respect their Guru’s…

25:45.690 --> 25:50.539
in the right way putting their guru’s in
their heart and in their behavior.

25:50.539 --> 25:53.070
That’s all they should have done.

25:53.070 --> 25:54.529
They should have just obeyed their Guru’s.

25:54.529 --> 25:59.039
There was no need to stand on your heads and
take mantras from these thugs paying them.

25:59.039 --> 26:03.789
There was no need at all to do all these things,
but no they thought that here we are doing

26:03.789 --> 26:07.749
black market money, let us make some big temples
so there are great Hindus, big temples are

26:07.749 --> 26:09.149
built, black market money going on.

26:09.149 --> 26:16.629
Here they are killing so many people the Muslims,
so they must say that we are doing it in the

26:16.629 --> 26:18.889
name of God, very nice.

26:18.889 --> 26:24.649
Where Mohammad Saab has talked of nothing
but Rehmat and Rahim, all the time Rehmat

26:24.649 --> 26:29.889
and Rahim he has talked of, see they were
about to kill him every moment wherever he

26:29.889 --> 26:36.549
went, it was such a dangerous situation, so
vicariously he was living and he had to defend

26:36.549 --> 26:38.019
himself.

26:38.019 --> 26:44.929
So now we have to defend ourselves from these
people, instead of these people defending

26:44.929 --> 26:45.929
themselves.

26:45.929 --> 26:51.369
It’s not in defense; it is in aggression,
these people are killing others and they think

26:51.369 --> 26:56.080
they are doing a great very great service
to the people.

26:56.080 --> 27:01.369
Then the Christians, they are one of the worst
fanatics worst fanatics are the Christians

27:01.369 --> 27:05.820
There cannot be worst fanatics than Christianity.

27:05.820 --> 27:10.680
Christianity is one religion which is very
clever and cunning, nobody can beat them all.

27:10.680 --> 27:11.680
For example they will do all missionary work.

27:11.680 --> 27:15.210
You’ll say ha a ha a ha what nice people.

27:15.210 --> 27:23.369
The missionary work, they are looking after
our poor people here, very nice people very

27:23.369 --> 27:27.799
great generous people and they will be converting
people.

27:27.799 --> 27:29.779
What are you converting them for?

27:29.779 --> 27:31.860
Have you got the power of realization?

27:31.860 --> 27:35.440
Have you got the power to call yourself Christian?

27:35.440 --> 27:38.220
Are you baptized in the real sense?

27:38.220 --> 27:41.629
That is how the Christians have been behaving
throughout.

27:41.629 --> 27:46.470
They have put up such a big show, this is
not God’s work, to get some people from

27:46.470 --> 27:49.179
the street who are dying put them in the room
and look after them.

27:49.179 --> 27:51.080
Is this the work of God?

27:51.080 --> 27:53.980
This the work of human beings?

27:53.980 --> 27:59.389
Work of God is just to raise the Kundalini
that is the work of God.

27:59.389 --> 28:02.999
Not the work of God is to have Hospitals and
Schools and things.

28:02.999 --> 28:09.909
This is not the work of God, this is your
job, this is you are doing it, but they are

28:09.992 --> 28:12.451
taking the name of God to earn money.

28:12.451 --> 28:14.869
In the name of God give me money.

28:14.969 --> 28:18.989
Such beggars I tell you of the first waters.

28:18.989 --> 28:23.818
Begging a man, who believes in God, will never
do.

28:23.818 --> 28:25.258
Why to beg?

28:25.258 --> 28:27.289
Why to ask for money?

28:27.329 --> 28:32.499
On the streets they will stand, nowadays our
Hare Rama and Hare Krishna in Oxford Street

28:32.518 --> 28:36.149
and beg money, in the name of God.

28:36.309 --> 28:42.580
Can there be greater sinners than these who
beg in the name of God and get money from

28:42.580 --> 28:46.926
others and live on other people’s money?

28:46.920 --> 28:48.816
All the time like parasites.

28:49.019 --> 28:54.129
This is they have done out of religion, or
ritualism go to the temples, there’s a priest

28:54.129 --> 28:57.379
standing there he gives you ghanta, he makes
something, puts something on your head, God

28:57.488 --> 29:00.548
knows he spoils the Agnya charka or what he
does?

29:00.638 --> 29:05.408
and you think “oh I have been to this temple,
I have been to that temple, I have been to

29:05.408 --> 29:11.739
this Teerath and that teerath and that teerath
and I have been a very religious man”.

29:11.772 --> 29:19.092
I tell you these extreme ideas about God has
really blinded us completely from reality.

29:19.092 --> 29:24.312
If you want the reality, you must know that
God is to be found within your heart and not

29:24.312 --> 29:25.312
in those places.

29:25.312 --> 29:29.292
Once you have found it in your heart then
you will know that where is the real God in

29:29.292 --> 29:31.873
which temple and how to approach.

29:31.873 --> 29:42.432
Now if I ask you, In Delhi how many temples
are really jaagrut, except for Sahaja yogis

29:42.432 --> 29:49.442
nobody can say, you see a stone namaste another
stone might have been brought from some bathroom

29:49.442 --> 29:50.442
namaste.

29:50.992 --> 29:58.412
Is that a real jaagrut one?

29:58.442 --> 30:06.132
It is said in the Bible that whatever is produced,
created by mother Earth and by the Sky should

30:06.192 --> 30:09.493
not be reproduced, now what is that is created?

30:09.583 --> 30:12.672
What is that is created by Mother Earth?

30:12.752 --> 30:22.691
We Indians know these are the jaagrut deities
which are created by Mother Earth, these are

30:22.691 --> 30:31.852
the jaagrut deities and that is to be worshipped
and not to get a Ganapati somewhere for 2

30:31.852 --> 30:35.281
rupees, my forefathers have given me so I
am carrying on.

30:35.281 --> 30:39.901
I must do their Puja, maybe the forefathers
are sitting on that.

30:41.653 --> 30:44.604
You won’t believe, there is a gentleman
in Bombay, who came to Me, to meet Me, his

30:44.604 --> 30:45.604
name is Mr.

30:45.604 --> 30:49.374
Shah, he said “Mother Lot’s of things
are happening, I don’t know how?”

30:49.374 --> 30:51.063
I said what happened?

30:51.063 --> 30:57.273
“In my house I am getting some old deities
from somewhere, just coming into my house

30:57.273 --> 31:00.575
from somewhere, I don’t know where from
where it comes?

31:00.935 --> 31:06.325
Sometimes I keep my windows open in the night
and I find in the morning there is a deity

31:06.325 --> 31:10.585
of silver sometimes diamonds are there in
the nose of the Lakshmi and I am surprised

31:10.585 --> 31:12.106
how am I getting it?”

31:12.106 --> 31:16.445
And the man is not so rich to have all these
things; he showed me and said now what to

31:16.445 --> 31:17.445
do?

31:17.445 --> 31:20.159
I told him; throw them all of them in the
sea, that’s what they deserve.

31:20.246 --> 31:22.819
He said from where have they come?

31:22.899 --> 31:28.028
These are the people who have habit of very
seriously worshipping those deities, without

31:28.028 --> 31:31.588
understanding that these deities have got
vibrations or not, whether they are jaagrut

31:31.588 --> 31:32.879
or not, they are alright or not.

31:32.879 --> 31:36.759
Even a plastic they’ll make, they’ll make
of aluminum.

31:36.759 --> 31:41.518
I don’t know now what they are going to
use next to make a deity and they will be

31:41.518 --> 31:46.208
carrying it on, have no value, have no understanding,
have no respect.

31:46.208 --> 31:52.869
So the people who own those, they must be
bringing it, the old people and putting in

31:52.869 --> 31:56.899
your house, so better put them in the sea,
otherwise they will not have their Mukti and

31:56.899 --> 31:58.629
this fellow is having greediness.

31:58.629 --> 32:01.911
He is always having a chakkar with these things.

32:01.941 --> 32:03.911
He said “what is happening to me?”

32:03.927 --> 32:08.311
His child is getting into problem; his wife
has run away from the house.

32:08.571 --> 32:13.740
All kinds of problems coming up, lost all
his money, every sort of problem coming up

32:13.740 --> 32:17.734
and this deity is coming in he said, should
I sell them and get some money.

32:18.284 --> 32:22.183
I said please don’t do it, to whomsoever
you will sell, you will sell asubah.

32:22.183 --> 32:27.203
These are coming by some dead person using
this bhanawati; they are bringing this down

32:27.203 --> 32:28.203
here.

32:28.203 --> 32:33.404
But there where he told Me thousands of people
wanting just to touch the feet of these bhootas.

32:33.404 --> 32:39.924
They thought such a bhoot cannot bring these
deities and that must be God who is coming

32:39.924 --> 32:41.204
in the form.

32:41.204 --> 32:47.093
If in the thing was written also, made in
near Mumbadevi and this and that.

32:47.093 --> 32:53.703
You mean God is sitting there and making those
statues?

32:53.703 --> 32:58.443
We don’t use our brains also, when it comes
to God.

32:58.443 --> 33:03.733
I mean faith is necessary no doubt, but this
is after realization, before realization it’s

33:03.733 --> 33:06.553
a blind faith, which can be any nonsense.

33:06.553 --> 33:11.014
I have seen such mad people that they just
go on pulling out their hair and they say

33:11.004 --> 33:15.449
that we are doing it in the name of God, really?

33:15.789 --> 33:18.260
Why did God give you these hairs?

33:18.260 --> 33:21.859
If he wanted you to pull it out like that
morning till evening sitting and pulling it

33:21.859 --> 33:27.270
out and they develop such nervousness that
if they are not properly aware they will start

33:27.270 --> 33:30.339
pulling out from your hair also.

33:30.339 --> 33:36.770
It is such a dangerous situation in this blind
faith, that you form some habits.

33:36.770 --> 33:43.659
You know people have an idea of using the
mala, that’s why Kabira has said “kar

33:43.659 --> 33:49.149
kamana ka chade de manna ka manna ka pher”
So they will also say, they will have it “kar

33:49.149 --> 33:53.291
kamana man ka chade de manna ka manna ka pher”
finished.

33:54.551 --> 34:02.112
Even the children have understood the joke,
this is what we are doing, that when it is

34:02.112 --> 34:08.801
told that you have to have God in your heart
and don’t do these rituals, you will find

34:08.801 --> 34:14.801
these people using that rosary to such an
extent, that if they are talking they don’t

34:14.801 --> 34:19.582
have that, they cannot sit tight, it’s like
a nervousness in them, it’s a nervousness

34:19.582 --> 34:25.142
by which they must go on (aur main to hamesha
mala jappti houn 108 and falaana) and you

34:25.142 --> 34:33.021
feel that the person is about to land up in
some lunatic asylum with the number 108.

34:33.021 --> 34:39.821
The way people are mad in religion makes people
really atheist they see these mad people what

34:39.821 --> 34:41.672
are they doing is the religion?

34:41.672 --> 34:45.791
Is this the religion, where people sell it,
you go to any temple?

34:45.791 --> 34:54.302
Once we had bought some Am rood, Guavas and
we went to the temple we were thinking that

34:54.302 --> 34:59.531
we will get out of, then we were very young,
[not clear_], and we were lots of brothers

34:59.531 --> 35:09.161
and sisters we went down to a temple and we
thought that after seeing the temple we will

35:09.233 --> 35:13.923
go outside behind the temple and we will eat
the thing as soon as we reached there, the

35:13.913 --> 35:17.972
Pujari took out the packets from our hands,
you know, all the children poor things were

35:17.972 --> 35:20.853
carrying three, four packets we had and they
took out everything from [not clear_], we

35:20.853 --> 35:27.563
were looking at them why did they took out
everything and gave us one each you see, wah

35:27.563 --> 35:33.662
wah !! and we were about to cry, but my younger
sister couldn’t bare it, she said “why

35:33.662 --> 35:36.226
did you take away my, all my Guavas?

35:36.276 --> 35:41.016
please return it to me”, but this is sort
of a right they have got to live on your money,

35:41.016 --> 35:43.008
these parasites.

35:43.142 --> 35:48.972
In the name of God these parasites, you are
the people who are nurturing them, you just

35:48.972 --> 35:54.392
giving them money, it is better to give to
a beggar, then to give to these horrible sophisticated

35:54.392 --> 35:59.052
beggars sitting on the temples and churches.

35:59.052 --> 36:04.882
You are the people who are responsible for
creating such a mess because half of the people

36:04.882 --> 36:11.601
are indifferent; those who are not indifferent
bhagvaan ke naam pe, half of them are like

36:11.601 --> 36:17.772
that who go to one Sidhhi Vinayak mandir and
Mangalwaar day (Tuesday), you will find that

36:17.762 --> 36:24.309
queue of sometimes two miles in that Bombay,
where people have no time for anything.

36:24.431 --> 36:31.615
People are moving with the pace of an Ant,
one inch in one hour, there are some people

36:31.615 --> 36:36.496
who start in the night and they move on, they
go with their naariyal and the naariyals,

36:36.496 --> 36:40.128
come from the other side and sold again next
month.

36:40.228 --> 36:47.328
They know this; still they say we have done
it with bhakti and Ganesha will give us what

36:47.328 --> 36:48.328
we like.

36:48.368 --> 36:51.434
Ganesha will only give you wisdom, I wish
he could, I wish he could give you wisdom

36:51.484 --> 36:53.924
and understanding about religion.

36:53.994 --> 37:01.204
This is a mess we have done out of our religion,
every religion, every religion is not only

37:01.204 --> 37:04.974
Hinduism, Islam or Christianity or Sikhism.

37:04.974 --> 37:09.494
We have really killed the religion by our
indifference, or by too much of indulgence,

37:09.494 --> 37:14.544
blind fold, faith in all these horrible people,
who claim that they are religious people,

37:14.634 --> 37:16.454
by what means are they?

37:16.492 --> 37:18.582
Go and see their lifestyle.

37:18.582 --> 37:21.802
Go and see what sort of a people they are.

37:21.892 --> 37:26.622
They are raksasha’s some of them I can tell
you, when I went to Vrindavan I felt all the

37:26.622 --> 37:29.712
anucharaas of Kansa are their fundas.

37:29.712 --> 37:36.282
All of them not one I found as a human being,
they are such horrible people and the way

37:36.282 --> 37:40.531
they torture you still you go about religion.

37:40.531 --> 37:50.543
One has to understand that God stands in His
purity He is a pure being and He likes our

37:50.531 --> 37:51.531
wisdom.

37:51.683 --> 37:54.944
He doesn’t like people who are stupid and
foolish.

37:54.944 --> 38:05.065
He likes wise people, wise people… like,
Prahllad, Prahllad was an eight year old boy,

38:05.139 --> 38:14.599
when his father Hiranyakashyup challenged
him, Shri Vishnu appeared in a pillar, you

38:14.609 --> 38:26.379
know in a Narsimha avatar and he killed his
father and then he asked this little boy of

38:26.389 --> 38:29.264
eight years Prahllad, he said, “my child,
my devotee, what do you want?”

38:29.358 --> 38:39.077
He could have asked for anything, Sakshaat
Vishnu was there, but what does he say, “Tav

38:39.077 --> 38:43.557
charna arvinde pritii” Give me love at your
lotus feet, oh my lord that’s all what I

38:43.557 --> 38:44.557
want.

38:44.557 --> 38:46.735
To love you at your lotus feet.

38:46.927 --> 38:51.735
If you have your pure love for God He will
give you wisdom.

38:51.805 --> 38:58.584
If you do not have your purity you go there
to ask for this thing and that thing; Give

38:58.584 --> 39:05.965
me a transfer, specially government servants,
they are never satisfied, they want to have

39:05.965 --> 39:12.641
transfers all the time, Give me a promotion,
Give me a son, when you get a son, give me

39:12.655 --> 39:14.255
a job for my son.

39:14.341 --> 39:19.081
When he gets a job, get him a wife, poor Ganesha
must be tired.

39:19.631 --> 39:24.581
This is what it is, this is not religion,
this is not God, this has nothing to do with

39:24.581 --> 39:30.461
spirituality, you have to ask for one thing,
“Tav charna arvinde pritii."

39:30.461 --> 39:38.431
Oh lord let me be at your lotus feet so that
one day my Kundalini would be awakened and

39:38.431 --> 39:44.158
that my atma would be enlightened within my
awareness.

39:44.728 --> 39:51.668
Let me keep my life so beautiful, “Ye chaadar
rishi muni jann odhi, Odhi ke meli kini chadariya,Daas

39:51.668 --> 39:55.529
Kabir jatan se odhi, Jaisi ki taisi rakh dini
chadariya."

39:55.529 --> 40:07.398
This is what we should have done, instead
of that we go to this Tan trick, that bhajji,

40:07.398 --> 40:15.010
that Pundit ji, that Pandey ji, or some other
Paadri ji or what you call them other sorts

40:15.010 --> 40:19.958
of people those Mullah ji’s and all sorts
of Mau Lana ji’s and Pir’s and all sorts

40:19.958 --> 40:22.188
of things and what do you get?

40:22.188 --> 40:23.539
A bad Agnya.

40:23.539 --> 40:29.769
They have no right to be there, they are there
because they want to make a business out of

40:29.769 --> 40:30.769
God.

40:30.769 --> 40:36.619
Today I spoke about it, because it is important
to understand, what is religion?

40:36.619 --> 40:45.978
In India especially I have seen people go
out of the way to do penances in the name

40:45.978 --> 40:54.939
of God, which is a great thing, but why do
you do penance, what is there to suffer?

40:54.939 --> 41:00.249
Why do you make your body suffer so much?

41:00.259 --> 41:04.519
Keep your body alright, don’t overdo things,
keep a moderate life, lead a normal life,

41:04.599 --> 41:08.738
that’s what Buddha has told you, there is
no need to go to extremes for anything, but

41:08.738 --> 41:16.349
even Buddhist, they have gone to another extreme
so he had to come on this Earth as Shankaracharaya

41:16.349 --> 41:18.323
to tell people what are you doing?

41:18.358 --> 41:20.083
When did I say this?

41:22.273 --> 41:27.013
Then they were born as the son of Fatimabai
[editor’s note to verifier: John Noyce has

41:27.024 --> 41:34.623
verified that this is the correct spelling]
who was herself nothing else but Janaki and

41:34.676 --> 41:41.536
they were her sons Hassan and Hussein, who
had preached non-violence and they saw that

41:41.536 --> 41:47.706
people were trying to save bugs and mosquitoes.

41:48.497 --> 41:54.258
You know there are some funny cults where
we are so particular of bugs mosquitoes and

41:54.258 --> 42:00.438
all the worms, we are not at all particular
about human beings, they, I don’t know what

42:00.438 --> 42:02.417
am I going to do with bugs?

42:02.409 --> 42:04.357
Am I going to give them realization?

42:04.439 --> 42:07.307
Even chicken’s… am I going to give them
realization?

42:07.625 --> 42:10.756
I have to give realization to human beings.

42:10.756 --> 42:13.815
What is the need to pay so much attention
to these nonsensical things?

42:13.895 --> 42:22.005
To save the bugs and save the mosquitoes and
make them bite the Brahmin and pay them money,

42:22.006 --> 42:25.206
because they think they have done a great
kalyana on the bugs.

42:25.246 --> 42:29.376
Perhaps they might have been bugs, in last
lives, the way they are interested in all

42:29.466 --> 42:30.806
these mosquitoes.

42:34.566 --> 42:42.106
Now, these two were born as Hassan and Hussein
and to get rid of these ideas of non-violence

42:42.106 --> 42:51.336
they had this Karbala, in which they fought
and died like great shuras (great warriors).

42:51.336 --> 42:54.476
This is a story of great incarnations on this
Earth.

42:54.476 --> 43:02.316
There are so many of them who were born, I
have no time to tell you, but Socrates was

43:02.316 --> 43:05.486
the same, his disciple was one of these two.

43:05.486 --> 43:14.215
Abraham, Moses, who are propagating Jews their
religion, [not clear] people are another mad,

43:14.215 --> 43:20.226
another mad people I can tell you, these Jews,
God save them from their madness, they will

43:20.226 --> 43:26.326
make a sum that their books are, say called
as, todhat [not clear], they make it microscopic,

43:26.326 --> 43:33.877
the more microscopic it is, the more spiritual
you are and they tie it up here you see, you

43:33.877 --> 43:40.032
can’t even read it, you have to use a nice
magnifying glass to read that, they never

43:40.067 --> 43:42.362
read, its tied up here.

43:42.506 --> 43:47.827
According to them, if it is studded with diamonds,
then you are a greater spiritual person, they

43:47.827 --> 43:55.917
are very rich people you see, so they tie
it up there and before a wailing wall they

43:55.917 --> 44:03.147
go and like mad they are beating their heads
there and weeping for what they have done.

44:03.147 --> 44:06.907
I mean there is no end to the madness of people.

44:06.907 --> 44:11.097
You can understand that this is not religion.

44:11.097 --> 44:16.187
Now the other day there was one Arya samaji
fellow who came to Me, he could not get his

44:16.187 --> 44:21.637
realization; I must tell you these are another
fanatic types we have, Arya samaji, have they

44:21.637 --> 44:24.677
been able to get to their spirit?

44:24.677 --> 44:30.127
They are only bothered about re-converting
the people, marrying the people or building

44:30.127 --> 44:34.167
the buildings and saying that, no we don’t
believe in God, we don’t believe in this

44:34.167 --> 44:35.167
kind of a God.

44:35.167 --> 44:36.167
We don’t believe in.

44:36.167 --> 44:39.024
Who cares whether you believe or not, who
are you?

44:39.037 --> 44:41.784
What right have you got to say anything?

44:41.814 --> 44:45.234
It’s like any monkey standing up and saying,
“I don’t believe in this government, I

44:45.234 --> 44:47.644
don’t believe in that government”.

44:48.984 --> 44:52.514
Who is bothered about these people who talk
like this.

44:52.514 --> 44:53.585
Who are they?

44:53.593 --> 44:56.735
What authority have they got to say what is
good and what is bad.

44:56.747 --> 44:59.725
Do they know what is good and what is bad?

44:59.809 --> 45:05.439
To say like these things about, we don’t
believe in this and we don’t believe in

45:05.439 --> 45:06.439
that.

45:06.439 --> 45:13.028
For us it is essential to know that, first
let us know ourselves, let us get our light

45:13.028 --> 45:21.288
enlightened and in that light let us see the
truth as it is you cannot ask the truth to

45:21.288 --> 45:23.248
be like this.

45:23.248 --> 45:24.874
You cannot organize God.

45:24.888 --> 45:30.304
He is what He is, He remain as He is, you
cannot transform Him.

45:30.424 --> 45:34.533
Only thing you can do is become one with Him.

45:34.533 --> 45:41.124
What you can do is to perceive Him, to feel
Him, to be, that is the thing you can be,

45:41.124 --> 45:46.313
but you cannot make God as you like Him, He
is what He is as I have told you.

45:46.313 --> 45:51.744
and the best thing will be that you be humble
like Prahllad, to say, “Tav charna arvinde

45:51.744 --> 45:56.083
pritii” Who are we to criticize these incarnations
of Primordial master?

45:56.083 --> 45:57.993
What have we done?

45:57.993 --> 46:03.184
Like, once somebody started criticizing Me,
so one of my disciples, Bardarf [not clear]

46:03.184 --> 46:08.234
called him, come here, come here, how many
people have you given realization to?

46:08.234 --> 46:12.224
He said “none”, He said, How many people
have you cured?

46:12.224 --> 46:13.293
What good have you done to people?

46:13.293 --> 46:14.674
He said none, what do you do?

46:14.674 --> 46:19.164
He said I am a barber, he said you better
become a barber.

46:19.164 --> 46:20.684
What are you talking here?

46:20.684 --> 46:21.783
What right have you got?

46:21.783 --> 46:23.693
What is your position to talk?

46:23.703 --> 46:31.313
But in this kalyuga, even a person who does
not even know a word about religion, about

46:31.313 --> 46:36.153
God, who is not awakened, who is not realized,
then talk about God.

46:36.183 --> 46:41.003
This is ghour kalyuga, they are not afraid,
they are not afraid, to make money in the

46:41.076 --> 46:49.607
name of God is the greatest sin, is the greatest
sin, I tell you, to make money like that in

46:49.708 --> 46:52.927
the name of God and to spoil somebody’s
Kundalini, as these, all these fake Guru’s

46:52.949 --> 46:53.949
are doing.

46:54.071 --> 46:58.210
Using there bhoot vidya, they do not know
they will go to hell permanently; absolutely

46:58.210 --> 47:04.320
permanently they will be there and there will
be no return from there.

47:04.929 --> 47:10.429
They have been given many chances before,
but no more chances for them.

47:10.429 --> 47:17.179
We are the people who have to correct them,
we have to stand together and tell them, nothing

47:17.179 --> 47:23.519
doing, we had some people in Bombay who are
Brahmins, who are Brahmins, who are Brahmins

47:23.519 --> 47:28.993
of the high order as we can call, [not clear]
they are called as and they got their realization.

47:29.023 --> 47:33.513
Now they had to be taken up upon yourself
to put down all these horrible fake people

47:33.547 --> 47:36.413
who are making money out of the public.

47:36.487 --> 47:42.730
So one of them is a teacher and he told a
Brahmin in his family, because he was permanently

47:42.770 --> 47:46.090
stuck, you see us Brahmins stuck to the families.

47:46.151 --> 47:54.301
He said that, “my”, “I have to do the
Shard of my father, when can you come, within

47:54.301 --> 47:55.301
the Pitrupaksh?

47:55.301 --> 47:58.381
He said I can only come on Wednesday or something
like that.

47:58.381 --> 48:01.311
He said are you sure that there is a Muhrata
for that?

48:01.311 --> 48:03.470
Yes, he said, yes very I am sure of it.

48:03.470 --> 48:08.121
So he went to another fellow, got the Panchanga,
Maharashtrians, that way know a lot about

48:08.121 --> 48:12.001
these things like Panchanga and all that and
he opened the Panchanga he studied there and

48:12.001 --> 48:14.271
he found out that there was no muhrata, in
any Panchanga whatsoever.

48:14.271 --> 48:19.001
There are three Panchangas which we use, I
don’t know if we know here about it, he

48:19.001 --> 48:26.628
saw all of them, then accordingly the muhrata
was on Tuesday, he celebrated it.

48:27.368 --> 48:34.198
Then the fellow came, “rehne dijiye, rehne
dijiye, baad mein le lenge rehne do”.

48:34.198 --> 48:38.510
Then the fellow came and he said that “I
have come now come along let us have the shard”,

48:38.630 --> 48:41.519
He said that “I will not even give you a
cup of tea to you today” He said how?

48:41.519 --> 48:46.240
You call me for the Shard I am suppose to
eat at your place, he says no, we have not

48:46.240 --> 48:49.969
cooked anything and I am not going to give
you a cup of tea, if there is no muhrata today,

48:49.969 --> 48:53.540
he said according to Tilak Panchanga it is,
he said I have studied also Tilak Panchanga,

48:53.622 --> 48:56.474
I have studied all this, you get out of here.

48:56.626 --> 49:01.305
The mother was poor thing you know, she said
“how you can this, he is our old thing”,

49:01.305 --> 49:04.055
he said “this is the only chance I have
to get rid of this old fool” and he just

49:04.055 --> 49:10.746
told him, get out you will not stay in this
house and I am not going to give a cup of

49:10.746 --> 49:11.746
tea.

49:11.746 --> 49:20.696
Then in Panduranga’s temple, in…, Panduranga’s
temple is there you know about Vitthhalla’s

49:20.696 --> 49:31.386
in Panderpur [not clear] we have people going
down there and when I saw these people I was

49:31.386 --> 49:35.186
surprised, they were all crazy people for
a month poor things are singing songs eat

49:35.186 --> 49:38.555
little take that nasha of tambacco and go
singing songs for months together they go

49:38.555 --> 49:45.476
to see Panduranga there and these people who
live there are called as Badwe, their names

49:45.850 --> 49:52.387
are absolutely suited you see, like in Kolapur
they are called as Bhootis, can you imagine?

49:52.417 --> 49:55.597
The Brahmins are called as Bhootis and these
are called as Badwe’s.

49:55.727 --> 50:01.308
and these people ask them, “How is it, you
have got cracks in your heads?” he said

50:01.308 --> 50:06.048
that this Naral, this naariyal or you can
call the coconut was broken at the lotus feet

50:06.048 --> 50:07.858
of Panduranga, I said, how?

50:07.858 --> 50:11.908
I couldn’t understand, these Badwe’s were
doing this job and when I said that these

50:11.918 --> 50:16.218
Badwe’s should know if they don’t behave,
they are going to have a very bad time, you

50:16.268 --> 50:19.079
see everybody was shocked but you’ll be
amazed within eight days the government took

50:19.079 --> 50:24.681
over that place and its working out, but now
their language has changed, but this is how

50:24.690 --> 50:28.691
these people have been troubling us, but now
we have got four Brahmins, four Brahmins living

50:28.760 --> 50:33.249
in Panderpur who are after their throat and
they go to the temple and tell people that

50:33.249 --> 50:38.409
don’t listen to the [unclear] and they are
propagating and they said that if you want

50:38.409 --> 50:44.969
anything you ask us, but don’t give a single
Pai to these Badwa’s, good for nothing,

50:44.969 --> 50:49.969
useless, whatever you want to do, you do it
to the deity and don’t touch these people,

50:49.969 --> 50:53.760
treat them as untouchables and these are the
people who have started it.

50:53.760 --> 50:55.739
It is we who can change the people.

50:55.739 --> 51:00.770
Once we get realization, the transformation
starts taking place within us.

51:00.770 --> 51:05.520
When the transformation takes place a person
becomes fearless.

51:05.520 --> 51:11.010
He is not tempted easily by things, for example
I have known people, who use to take a lot

51:11.010 --> 51:16.659
of bribes, have given up taking up bribe,
because their financial condition also improves,

51:16.659 --> 51:21.350
their Lakshmi tatwa is awakened and they do
not take any bribes, their Dharma is jaagrut,

51:21.350 --> 51:26.159
they do not drink, many people who were drunkards
have given up drinking, because the Dharma

51:26.159 --> 51:27.159
is awakened within us, you just can’t bare
it.

51:27.159 --> 51:31.435
Just like a human being cannot bear dirt but
an animal can.

51:31.585 --> 51:35.625
In the same way, it happens to you, you just
don’t bear it, you don’t want to have

51:35.696 --> 51:36.696
it anymore.

51:37.365 --> 51:41.475
In the same way, your political situation
will improve, because what is the problem

51:41.475 --> 51:43.755
today, what is the problem?

51:43.755 --> 51:48.224
if you have went down to Maharashtra and there
the people said that we have a problem of

51:48.224 --> 51:52.585
sugar, I said why, you produce a lot of sugar,
he said there is one fellow known as Sugar

51:52.585 --> 51:54.385
king, he has hoarded all the Sugar.

51:54.385 --> 51:55.945
I said really, then why don’t you inform
the police about it?

51:55.945 --> 51:59.745
They said, when Janta government was there
he gave them money, now this government is

51:59.745 --> 52:02.935
here, he gives them money, he gives money
to all police officers, he is driving all

52:02.935 --> 52:08.345
of them and he also bribed us and made us
vote for certain people, who are under his

52:08.345 --> 52:09.345
control.

52:09.345 --> 52:12.566
I said, then you are responsible for this.

52:12.646 --> 52:18.566
You get your realization and next time only
vote for or stand with a realized soul .Do

52:18.635 --> 52:24.385
not vote for anyone who is not a realized
soul and you will see this country will change

52:24.385 --> 52:29.485
just like this, the whole situation will change
.It is you who are misusing your votes, in

52:29.485 --> 52:34.290
the villages even for one time need they give
votes.

52:34.380 --> 52:36.590
How are you going to improve your people?

52:36.590 --> 52:42.781
How this deterioration is going to stop by
only, by your parivartan, by your transformation,

52:42.851 --> 52:46.121
that’s only possible through Kundalini awakening.

52:46.244 --> 52:50.174
When the Kundalini awakening takes place the
man knows his esteem, he stands up like a

52:50.174 --> 52:57.108
human being and he doesn’t behave like a
dog, who runs after every position you get,

52:57.144 --> 52:59.988
every money you get, “give me, give me”.

53:00.004 --> 53:02.334
It’s not like that.

53:02.408 --> 53:10.850
He stands in his dignity and in his [not clear
] and nobody can put him down.

53:10.900 --> 53:17.020
This is what it is; the Sahaja Yoga is such
a blessing, for all of us, in all the world,

53:17.080 --> 53:23.174
wherever there is a chaos, it is everywhere
now and so many angles it is going to it,

53:23.264 --> 53:29.264
for Samaj Karya also, now in Samaj specially
in the north, you see the condition is very

53:29.264 --> 53:32.954
bad, the woman are treated very shabbily,
they say it’s the influence of the Muslim

53:32.954 --> 53:34.604
religion and whatever it is.

53:34.604 --> 53:42.583
But if you go to Turkey, you will be surprised
that the people treat woman with such respect

53:42.583 --> 53:44.277
and such understanding.

53:44.337 --> 53:48.548
In our own scriptures it is written that:
“Yatra naryastu pujyante ramante tatra Devata”[Manu

53:48.548 --> 53:54.418
smriti 3-56] Means, where the woman is respected,
there resides the Gods, but the woman has

53:54.418 --> 53:58.288
to be respectable also, if she is not a respectable,
no use respecting her.

53:58.288 --> 54:03.678
It is both ways, but the way we treat our
woman, in the villages, specially in the North,

54:03.678 --> 54:09.988
like Bihar, U.P, Punjab, Punjab is now better,
woman have taken over quite a lot.

54:09.988 --> 54:14.738
But that should not be the case, woman should
remain woman but men must respect them.

54:14.738 --> 54:19.728
What I mean, that woman must be respected
as they are and men must be respected as they

54:19.728 --> 54:20.728
are.

54:20.728 --> 54:24.908
They don’t have to change their places but
in these places, all Bengal all of them you

54:24.908 --> 54:27.548
now how [unclear].

54:27.596 --> 54:31.038
Women commit suicides in that country because
they cannot get married and they are put down.

54:31.048 --> 54:33.918
If you cannot get married what does it matter?

54:33.942 --> 54:36.942
You have to give dowry, if you don’t give
dowry you cannot get married.

54:36.942 --> 54:41.373
All kinds of problems a husband will come
drunkard, he will beat his wife because he

54:41.373 --> 54:44.973
is fallen in love with another woman, he is
going to some other person .The wife has to

54:44.963 --> 54:48.369
come as out and she becomes a woman who has
no husband, everybody ill treats the woman.

54:48.539 --> 54:51.329
All sorts of things are here, why?

54:51.329 --> 54:53.410
Because we do not understand that woman is
the Shakti.

54:53.410 --> 54:57.940
In her lies the Shakti we have to respect
the women.

54:57.940 --> 55:03.200
When the women are not respected that country
goes to dogs and the women must know that

55:03.200 --> 55:08.491
they are Shakti and they are to be respectable
and not to be frivolous and cheap the way

55:08.601 --> 55:13.481
Indian women are now taking to western life
I am really shocked that means that our tradition

55:13.546 --> 55:14.821
has no depth in it.

55:14.924 --> 55:19.353
That the way we have accepted all these nonsensical
values of the West, where the West has gone

55:19.353 --> 55:24.944
to dogs and we are going to dogs for this
I will hold the woman responsible who behave

55:24.944 --> 55:31.093
so cheaply on the streets and in the offices
and in the houses.

55:31.093 --> 55:35.613
It is the women who have to keep the Dharma
going.

55:35.613 --> 55:36.613
Now with this.

55:36.613 --> 55:39.393
It is very remarkable, what is happening,
if the mother of the house is not respected,

55:39.393 --> 55:44.274
is treated like a servant, she has no place
in the family, husband comes from the office

55:44.274 --> 55:52.475
and shouts at her, children cannot respect
her, they cannot be disciplined, if the mother

55:52.474 --> 55:53.823
is not respected.

55:55.435 --> 55:58.276
Your children can never be disciplined.

55:58.459 --> 56:01.468
You see now, you talk of indiscipline, indiscipline
everywhere.

56:01.468 --> 56:08.589
I remember, when I was young, we could not
do even a thing without asking our mother.

56:08.589 --> 56:14.958
If we had our father we wanted to, he’d
say, “Did you ask your mother?

56:14.958 --> 56:19.672
Go and ask your mother” In the family, in
the house she was the Grahalakshmi, she was

56:19.672 --> 56:25.878
given all the keys all the money, not a single
pie was spent without asking her.

56:25.948 --> 56:30.988
But these days, the woman have become so either
very miserly or so extra wagon that men do

56:30.988 --> 56:33.448
not know what to do with them.

56:33.448 --> 56:41.097
It was both ways, women have to be wise, they
are the axis the Dhuri of the society, that’s

56:41.097 --> 56:47.208
only possible when they are realized, suddenly
I find very rebellious woman become so, so

56:47.208 --> 56:54.278
beautiful, so beautiful and so women like,
so sweet, their, their tongue, their whole

56:54.278 --> 56:59.907
behavior everything changes so beautifully,
it’s surprising, even western women I have

56:59.907 --> 57:03.058
seen, who walk like horses normally.

57:03.058 --> 57:09.128
If you see them they really walk like horses,
but they change their dresses and their whole

57:09.128 --> 57:15.991
thing they become so feminine, so sweet, in
their talks and everything, then what will

57:16.006 --> 57:18.471
happen to Indian women?

57:18.896 --> 57:23.985
But men must know they have to respect women,
if they try to dominate their women, they

57:23.985 --> 57:28.495
will become the same as the western woman
and you will not know what to do with yourself.

57:28.495 --> 57:34.196
If the woman decides to be bad, there’s
no end to miseries that should not be done.

57:34.196 --> 57:40.670
So, please make it a short circuit and let
us understand that for Sahaja yogi it is important

57:40.655 --> 57:42.370
to respect the wife.

57:42.380 --> 57:49.949
So, that there is discipline, still I must
give all my respect to the Indian women, despite

57:49.949 --> 57:54.090
all these things, despite the, all the men
have changed their dresses, all the men have

57:54.090 --> 57:59.509
become English, Indian women have still kept
their dresses and their discipline.

57:59.509 --> 58:04.170
Our men still think, they are great English
people, but our Indian women are not willing

58:04.170 --> 58:05.170
to accept that situation.

58:05.170 --> 58:10.840
I am not saying that there is something wrong
with English, but if we are Indians we should

58:10.840 --> 58:13.860
be Indians, if they are English they should
be English and in the same way with our life,

58:13.860 --> 58:18.190
when there is realization, a woman becomes
a complete woman and a man becomes a complete

58:18.190 --> 58:26.509
man and a complete man we have before us is
Shri Rama, how he loved his wife, in separation

58:26.509 --> 58:32.769
and in meeting, how he loved and how they
despite all their love, how they suffered.

58:32.769 --> 58:37.750
We have before us Shri Rama where he respected
his wife.

58:37.750 --> 58:41.660
It is a Seashell for men to understand that
you are Indians and you have to behave like

58:41.660 --> 58:42.660
them.

58:42.660 --> 58:46.933
You do not know the greatness of our Indian
women.

58:47.203 --> 58:53.322
If you do not treat them well I can assure
you a day will come only very cheap and nasty

58:53.322 --> 58:57.352
and what you call demonic women will be born
here and you will be able to enter even your

58:57.352 --> 58:58.352
homes.

58:58.352 --> 59:01.724
You will be standing outside on your streets.

59:01.872 --> 59:08.343
So be careful about it and also you has brought
us before , the way you treat your wife the

59:08.344 --> 59:13.324
same way your daughters will be treated even
worse, then you will know what you did, so

59:13.324 --> 59:17.183
be kind to her because she has married to
you she is not your slave.

59:17.183 --> 59:18.654
Its is very important.

59:18.654 --> 59:23.174
In northern India more because they think
that southern India, Maharashtra and southern

59:23.174 --> 59:30.084
India women, men are henpecked unless and
until they beat their wives they are henpecked

59:30.084 --> 59:31.824
according to them.

59:31.824 --> 59:40.333
These ideas must be given up but this is only
possible when you get your realization real

59:40.333 --> 59:47.703
joy of leading a very happy married life extremely
beautiful married life of mutual love and

59:47.703 --> 59:52.024
mutual understanding develops I have seen
this happening to so many people the relationship

59:52.024 --> 59:58.044
improving the relationship between parents
and children improving the whole thing becoming

59:58.044 --> 01:00:03.953
so joyous and so beautiful and the children
becoming so obedient and so sweet, it’s

01:00:03.953 --> 01:00:09.214
a beautiful thing so when the atmosphere is
fragrant with your spirituality the whole

01:00:09.214 --> 01:00:16.534
aroma , the whole atmosphere we can say completely
charmed ,absolutely charmed by your peaceful

01:00:16.534 --> 01:00:17.534
life.

01:00:17.534 --> 01:00:21.672
This is the bliss we have to see .

01:00:22.592 --> 01:00:27.342
Today I talked about these things because
void is very important thing for us where

01:00:27.342 --> 01:00:35.755
all our social, samajic, political, rajkiya
and also our spiritual problems can be solved.

01:00:35.835 --> 01:00:39.511
Apart from that I had told you yesterday about
our physical problems tomorrow I will talk

01:00:39.511 --> 01:00:45.951
about other charkas to you I hope you have
understood today’s lecture.

01:00:46.832 --> 01:00:53.701
I spoke in a very entertaining manner but
you have to know that all this entertainment

01:00:53.724 --> 01:00:59.793
has to go within yourself, you have to take
within your self, it’s not meant for others

01:01:00.103 --> 01:01:04.234
as soon as you say it is for other, the women
will look at the husbands and the husbands

01:01:04.234 --> 01:01:05.623
will look at the wives.

01:01:05.623 --> 01:01:09.389
They do not know it is meant for you and not
for others.

01:01:09.479 --> 01:01:16.118
All of you should take it up, that am I doing
this, am I doing this, try to correct yourself,

01:01:16.118 --> 01:01:21.789
you have to be decent husbands and decent
wives and I would like to see very happy married

01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:26.098
couples amongst Sahaja Yogis, when this will
happen then the great souls will take birth

01:01:26.098 --> 01:01:31.090
on this earth, you will see great people will
be born.

01:01:31.190 --> 01:01:35.499
Already so many Sahaja Yogis have given birth
to very, very great souls.

01:01:35.499 --> 01:01:39.806
You will be amazed they know Kundalini from
their very childhood this will happen I am

01:01:39.888 --> 01:01:45.038
sure one day it will come and that all the
souls who want to take birth will be born

01:01:45.048 --> 01:01:47.538
on this earth, especially in India.

01:01:47.782 --> 01:01:53.292
Already lots of great souls I have seen also
in England, let me go I see in Australia I

01:01:53.292 --> 01:01:55.708
am sure it’s happening everywhere.

01:01:55.748 --> 01:02:01.298
But if you are realized souls you really become
perfect parents and you really invite great

01:02:01.298 --> 01:02:03.828
souls on this earth to work it out.

01:02:03.898 --> 01:02:06.398
May God bless you
