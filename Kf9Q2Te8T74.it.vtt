[Shri Mataji parla con uno yogi]

00:00:12.991 --> 00:00:15.924
Yogi: “Shri Mataji ha appena detto 
molto chiaramente

00:00:15.979 --> 00:00:18.871
che dovremmo smetterla 
di preoccuparci degli aerei.

00:00:18.926 --> 00:00:21.507
È tutto organizzato, tutto predisposto,

00:00:21.562 --> 00:00:24.961
non c’è da preoccuparsi 
né per i biglietti, né per i voli”.

00:00:25.081 --> 00:00:27.015
Per favore, smettete di preoccuparvi, 
se ne occupa Dio

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.735
– questo ferisce veramente Shri Mataji.

00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:32.654
Shri Mataji ha appena detto che la ferisce

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:36.737
quando pensiamo e continuiamo 
a preoccuparci dei nostri aerei.

00:00:39.057 --> 00:00:44.773
Tutto è stato organizzato, 
non cè niente di cui preoccuparsi.

00:00:57.143 --> 00:01:00.236
I sahaja yogi non dovrebbero
scadere al livello

00:01:00.336 --> 00:01:05.045
della gente comune: in fin dei conti
che cosa vi accadrà?

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.232
Direi che coloro che si sono preoccupati

00:01:09.287 --> 00:01:10.773
dovrebbero entrare
in meditazione profonda,

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:14.672
e capire che stanno insultando se stessi.

00:01:14.727 --> 00:01:17.867
Voi siete santi. Perché dovreste
preoccuparvi di quale aereo prenderete

00:01:17.922 --> 00:01:19.955
o non prenderete?

00:01:20.181 --> 00:01:23.067
Questo dimostra che il vostro livello
è molto basso,decisamente;

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:25.691
quello di tutti coloro
che si sono preoccupati.

00:01:25.766 --> 00:01:28.459
Siete venuti qui

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:33.496
sotto la mia protezione e tornerete
indietro sotto la mia protezione.

00:01:42.312 --> 00:01:46.472
Sono stata così male questa mattina che
pensavo che non avremmo celebrato il puja.

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:49.703
Dovete capire che siete
parte integrante del mio essere;

00:01:49.758 --> 00:01:53.109
io vi ho messi nel mio corpo
e dovete comportarvi correttamente.

00:02:01.148 --> 00:02:03.747
In un giorno così propizio

00:02:03.802 --> 00:02:08.463
ci siamo riuniti tutti qui

00:02:10.366 --> 00:02:13.432
per celebrare questo puja speciale.

00:02:15.372 --> 00:02:20.790
Direi che si dovrebbe definire
un Mahalakshmi Puja, poiché

00:02:20.936 --> 00:02:26.997
ha a che vedere con l’industria
di questo paese e del mondo intero.

00:02:32.294 --> 00:02:37.143
Tutte le imprese umane,
se non sono connesse con Dio,

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:43.156
non possono raggiungere un livello
e una condizione di perfezione.

00:02:43.576 --> 00:02:46.623
Ecco perché adesso ci sono problemi
in Occidente: nonostante (lì)

00:02:46.683 --> 00:02:49.405
la gente sia considerata
molto intelligente, molto brillante,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.393
molto dotata e ben istruita,

00:02:52.448 --> 00:02:57.296
abbiamo la recessione e altro
poiché mancano di equilibrio.

00:02:57.351 --> 00:03:02.671
Non si rendono conto che esiste il potere
di Dio che fa funzionare tutto e che,

00:03:02.731 --> 00:03:08.110
quando lo si trascura,
questo è quel che vi accade.

00:03:09.056 --> 00:03:17.834
Ora, per ogni impresa di questo tipo che intraprendiamo, per prima cosa dobbiamo prelevare una grande quantità di materia (prima) dalla Madre Terra.

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:23.166
first of all we have to use a lot of material from the Mother Earth,

00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:30.709
but if it is taken for a proper purpose, for constructive things

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.625
and for helping others, with a balance,

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:43.291
then Mother Earth can think, She can produce, more and more,

00:03:43.291 --> 00:03:45.750
all this She has produced before.

00:03:45.792 --> 00:03:48.542
She can produce for people who are sensible,

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:58.250
who are in tune with God, not just making money for themselves,

00:03:58.291 --> 00:04:09.750
or for their own purpose, but are thinking in totality,

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:15.291
thinking as to what we can achieve by doing this.

00:04:15.333 --> 00:04:21.792
And that is how an industry can grow.

00:04:21.834 --> 00:04:25.291
Now we see in Japan so much industry has grown,

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:30.333
but no spirituality. They are not at all happy people.

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:36.500
Their children are suffering, families are suffering.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:44.667
Money cannot get the total well being of a human being.

00:04:44.709 --> 00:04:48.875
So a balance has to be drawn.

00:04:48.875 --> 00:04:53.792
Especially in our country, thank God, we didn’t have

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:59.542
such a fast industrialization, and that’s why we are saved

00:04:59.542 --> 00:05:02.250
of lots of problems that the Western people are suffering,

00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:04.875
about which the Indians are not aware.

00:05:04.917 --> 00:05:09.583
They think you are all living in a very comfortable life there.

00:05:09.625 --> 00:05:17.792
Industry has to go hand-in-hand with the handicrafts,

00:05:17.792 --> 00:05:24.792
and the industrialists have to also look after the artists,

00:05:24.834 --> 00:05:28.542
because otherwise who will look after them?

00:05:28.583 --> 00:05:32.500
How will they bring forth the balance between the art and the industry?

00:05:32.542 --> 00:05:37.875
And art is such a soothing thing for these hard-working people.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:41.792
They work the whole day, then there is some sort of a music,

00:05:41.792 --> 00:05:51.750
art, to console them, to give them peace, to relax them,

00:05:51.792 --> 00:05:59.250
and a balance. So I would say that all industries

00:05:59.291 --> 00:06:06.250
must take to some artistic ventures also, or they should also produce things.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.667
After I was telling Rajesh many a times that you should try to produce

00:06:10.709 --> 00:06:16.208
something artistic out of the steel scrap that is left over, will be a good idea.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:18.083
They have tried something like that.

00:06:18.125 --> 00:06:25.458
But industry should not be looked down upon

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.917
as it is looked down upon in our country.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.500
I mean, as if industrialists are the greatest thieves

00:06:30.542 --> 00:06:35.750
and all the politicians are saints in this country. It’s the other way around I think.

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.500
It should be treated with respect,

00:06:38.542 --> 00:06:40.667
and should be understood that it’s very important.

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:46.250
And the industrialists, if they become also enlightened,

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:52.625
they can do a lot, not only to their own country,

00:06:52.667 --> 00:06:55.500
but also to the people whom they are looking after.

00:06:56.922 --> 00:06:59.838
Nel principio di Mahalakshmi,

00:06:59.902 --> 00:07:04.449
Mahalakshmi ha diversi mudra
(posizioni delle mani).

00:07:04.796 --> 00:07:11.782
Un mudra è quello
con la mano destra messa così.

00:07:11.889 --> 00:07:15.665
Ora, la mano destra è per proteggere

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:23.934
chi sia sotto la tutela
o al servizio di un ricco

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:26.785
o, diciamo, di un industriale.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.417
In India if you call somebody a rich man it’s like abusing him.

00:07:29.458 --> 00:07:33.208
Nobody likes it, because the rich are always shown

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:35.709
to be the worst people, which is not so.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:40.000
In My own experience it’s not so. If there’s a poor man also he could be terrible.

00:07:40.041 --> 00:07:43.333
We have had very bad experiences now, in Ganapatipule,

00:07:43.375 --> 00:07:45.500
of very poor people how they behaved

00:07:45.542 --> 00:07:49.166
in a very funny manner - supposed to be poor.

00:07:52.074 --> 00:07:57.252
Dovrebbe dunque esserci
un giusto equilibrio.

00:07:57.391 --> 00:08:02.723
Si dovrebbe creare un giusto equilibrio

00:08:02.785 --> 00:08:06.942
nella comprensione tra poveri e ricchi,
e tra ricchi e poveri.

00:08:07.137 --> 00:08:12.590
Dopo un po’ si vedrà che la gente

00:08:12.677 --> 00:08:17.909
non considererà più la ricchezza
e la povertà così importanti,

00:08:18.016 --> 00:08:22.875
ma sarà la ricchezza dello Spirito
a diventare importante.

00:08:23.069 --> 00:08:26.876
Così saranno le nazioni sahaj,

00:08:27.076 --> 00:08:32.002
dove la ricchezza del cuore,
la spiritualità,

00:08:32.069 --> 00:08:38.282
l’unione con il Divino diverranno
la più grande benedizione per tutti.

00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:45.393
Ma stiamo ancora lottando per arrivare
a questo stato – per molti è così –

00:08:45.448 --> 00:08:49.841
e ancora cadiamo
in capricci materialistici

00:08:49.896 --> 00:08:56.782
o in qualche stupida preoccupazione.

00:08:57.051 --> 00:08:59.676
Occorre fare attenzione
a tutte queste cose.

00:08:59.731 --> 00:09:02.793
Se riuscirete a mantenere così,

00:09:02.994 --> 00:09:09.308
e a far avanzare più rapidamente
questo carro di un nuovo progresso,

00:09:09.363 --> 00:09:17.248
creeremo un nuovo mondo di armonia,
pace, gioia, amore totali.

00:09:17.385 --> 00:09:20.518
Ma siete solo voi che dovete farlo.

00:09:23.378 --> 00:09:27.784
Io non posso; se avessi potuto farlo io non
vi avrei chiesto di unirvi a Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:31.649
È come per i cavalli e l’auriga:

00:09:33.509 --> 00:09:39.730
i cavalli devono essere guidati;
non è l’auriga a tirare il carro.

00:09:40.016 --> 00:09:43.010
Allo stesso modo voi dovete comprendere
la vostra responsabilità:

00:09:43.103 --> 00:09:46.796
quello che stiamo facendo noi
è il lavoro più importante.

00:09:46.896 --> 00:09:55.316
Non sto parlando solo di industria
o di lavoro e capitale,

00:09:55.371 --> 00:09:59.656
ma del benessere complessivo.

00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:04.448
Certo, tutte queste cose ne sono
parte integrante, non c’è dubbio;

00:10:04.503 --> 00:10:08.963
ma l’equilibrio dovrebbe essere
con la totalità,

00:10:09.370 --> 00:10:13.243
quindi dobbiamo pensare
ad un benessere totale.

00:10:13.377 --> 00:10:16.383
Quando si inizia a pensare
al benessere globale,

00:10:16.438 --> 00:10:18.643
la prima cosa che dovrebbe
venirci in mente è:

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:23.894
“Siamo capaci di realizzarlo? Lo siamo?

00:10:23.949 --> 00:10:29.670
Abbiamo noi il totale benessere interiore
oppure no? Lo abbiamo?”.

00:10:29.756 --> 00:10:32.274
Noi ci preoccupiamo ancora
se l’aereo arriva o meno.

00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:36.656
Insomma, siamo ancora così terra terra,
così piccoli, così limitati.

00:10:39.676 --> 00:10:44.563
Con un bandhan potete controllare
qualunque aereo, qualunque atmosfera;

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:49.263
(mentre), insomma, eccovi ancora qui
a preoccuparvi di cose che

00:10:49.343 --> 00:10:52.617
sono completamente
sotto il vostro controllo.

00:10:53.723 --> 00:10:56.602
Questa totalità è dunque
qualcosa su cui riflettere:

00:10:56.657 --> 00:11:01.530
“Cos’è questa totalità
di cui parla Madre?”.

00:11:03.016 --> 00:11:07.834
In questa totalità deve essere creato
un mondo fatto di gente,

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:21.750
e creato da gente, che sia senza paura.
Questa paura deve scomparire.

00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:25.291
Dietro tanto assurdo nervosismo
c’è la paura.

00:11:25.291 --> 00:11:33.208
Per questo ciò che Lei fa è concederci
"abhayadan", sicurezza.

00:11:34.436 --> 00:11:41.077
Sotto la Sua protezione siete
al di là della paura, siete protetti.

00:11:41.178 --> 00:11:43.842
Ma se non volete credere in voi stessi

00:11:43.897 --> 00:11:50.141
e non volete credere nella Sua protezione,
nessuno può aiutarvi

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.714
perché per voi è tutto illusorio.

00:11:57.213 --> 00:12:03.155
Qualunque impresa si intraprenda
non si dovrebbe avere paura,

00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:08.128
perché Dio è con voi.
È un fatto, è la verità.

00:12:08.195 --> 00:12:09.935
Provateci.

00:12:10.075 --> 00:12:15.070
Quando però ci provate attraverso il vostro
ego, cadete nella trappola della paura.

00:12:15.125 --> 00:12:19.181
Ho constatato che le persone egoiste
sono le più impaurite

00:12:19.236 --> 00:12:22.608
e allarmate perché
creano panico negli altri

00:12:22.663 --> 00:12:26.643
e quindi pensano che un giorno
possa accadere anche a loro.

00:12:27.330 --> 00:12:30.810
When the English were here, first of all, in India,

00:12:30.865 --> 00:12:34.667
we were all frightened of them. Now I see

00:12:34.709 --> 00:12:38.750
that in England every English family is frightened of others.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.375
They’ll only open a chink of the door to see who is there,

00:12:42.417 --> 00:12:46.709
and shut it. They’re so frightened. I’m surprised,

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:48.750
they are the same English who ruled us here.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:51.375
And we were so bewitched before them and now

00:12:51.417 --> 00:12:53.667
they are the ones who are frightened of us;

00:12:53.709 --> 00:12:57.041
because when a person who is egoistical tries to dominate others

00:12:57.083 --> 00:13:01.250
he sees himself in the mirror and thinks

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:03.583
that the other person will dominate him.

00:13:03.625 --> 00:13:07.375
That’s how this fear creeps in, into our minds,

00:13:07.375 --> 00:13:11.583
and we start getting all kinds of these stupid tantrums

00:13:11.625 --> 00:13:14.875
out of this mythical fear.

00:13:16.630 --> 00:13:21.103
La paura è creata soltanto dal nostro ego.

00:13:23.236 --> 00:13:26.248
Chi non ha ego non avrà paura:

00:13:26.303 --> 00:13:29.863
non ha fatto male a nessuno, perché
quindi dovrebbe avere qualche paura?

00:13:29.996 --> 00:13:34.180
Un uomo o una donna così
saranno protetti da Dio

00:13:34.268 --> 00:13:36.474
perché ci pensa Dio.

00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:41.355
Quando arrendete il vostro ego a Dio,
assume Lui il controllo.

00:13:41.422 --> 00:13:45.035
Ma a chi ha ego, Lui dice:
“Va bene, fai pure,

00:13:45.090 --> 00:13:48.148
usa il tuo ego, prova a proteggerti
da solo, sbattici la testa!”.

00:13:48.203 --> 00:13:49.868
Così stanno le cose.

00:13:52.442 --> 00:13:56.180
Pertanto, quando parlo
di benessere totale,

00:13:56.235 --> 00:14:01.396
parlo del vostro proprio benessere totale.

00:14:01.476 --> 00:14:03.756
Quindi, per prima cosa, la paura

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:06.776
dovrebbe uscire completamente
dalle vostre menti,

00:14:06.843 --> 00:14:10.470
se credete in Dio Onnipotente.

00:14:10.563 --> 00:14:15.548
Dite: “Tu sei Dio Onnipotente, Tu sei
Onnipotente…”, ma sono soltanto parole.

00:14:15.628 --> 00:14:19.445
Se credete che Dio è onnipotente
e siete connessi con Lui,

00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:22.698
perché dovreste aver paura di qualcosa?

00:14:23.258 --> 00:14:27.285
Ma quando si dice di non aver paura,
viene fuori un altro estremo:

00:14:27.678 --> 00:14:30.221
“Noi non abbiamo paura,
possiamo fare quel che vogliamo,

00:14:30.276 --> 00:14:35.963
possiamo far tutto da soli,
non dobbiamo informarne nessuno”.

00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:40.503
Dovete dire a Dio tutto ciò che fate,

00:14:40.616 --> 00:14:43.367
dovete chiedere il Suo permesso,
dovete informarlo

00:14:43.434 --> 00:14:48.189
nel Suo darbar, alla Sua corte,

00:14:48.244 --> 00:14:53.282
dicendo: “Signore, noi stiamo pensando
di fare questo e questo…”.

00:14:54.236 --> 00:15:00.243
Invece pensate di essere voi Dio.
Non lo siete.

00:15:00.383 --> 00:15:03.047
Ecco perché l’altra faccia
dell’assenza di paura

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:05.953
è questa sorta di comportamento arbitrario

00:15:06.008 --> 00:15:08.755
che è molto pericoloso per Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:08.810 --> 00:15:11.616
per voi stessi e per chiunque altro.

00:15:15.935 --> 00:15:20.336
La seconda paura, insomma, che ho io ...

00:15:20.443 --> 00:15:23.356
è che, se vi dico qualcosa,

00:15:23.956 --> 00:15:28.816
il novantanove per cento di voi capisce che
è per il vostro bene, a vostro vantaggio;

00:15:28.883 --> 00:15:33.973
però c’è l’uno per cento di gente
che può reagire

00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:36.487
perché ha troppo ego e non lo accetterà,

00:15:36.542 --> 00:15:40.523
perché non pensa al proprio bene.

00:15:41.056 --> 00:15:44.645
Non capiscono che se io dico loro qualcosa

00:15:44.705 --> 00:15:51.935
è solo per dare completezza e totalità.

00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:55.236
Al contrario assumono
un atteggiamento molto sbagliato

00:15:55.291 --> 00:15:58.042
e questa è un’altra cosa senza senso.

00:15:58.176 --> 00:16:00.831
Quindi ormai si deve sviluppare

00:16:00.938 --> 00:16:04.556
una specie di indifferenza
verso questo tipo di persone

00:16:04.611 --> 00:16:10.260
che, senza motivo, vanno
all’altro limite dell’autodistruzione

00:16:10.333 --> 00:16:15.048
e non vogliono vedere il punto essenziale
di tutto ciò che vi dico.

00:16:15.134 --> 00:16:17.439
Soltanto io posso dirvelo; chi altri?

00:16:17.513 --> 00:16:20.603
Io devo dirvi ciò che non va in voi,

00:16:20.658 --> 00:16:24.204
ciò che avete fatto di sbagliato,
e allora dovete correggerlo.

00:16:25.524 --> 00:16:29.468
Questo è un altro tipo
di reazione che si ha.

00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:32.717
Significa che costoro non
sono interessati al proprio bene,

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:35.435
non sono interessati
al bene dei loro figli,

00:16:35.490 --> 00:16:40.343
non sono interessati al bene
del loro paese o del mondo intero.

00:16:40.410 --> 00:16:43.770
Perché allora siete venuti in Sahaja Yoga?
Ponetevi questa domanda.

00:16:44.443 --> 00:16:48.630
Certo, per ascendere.
Ma ascendere per cosa?

00:16:49.070 --> 00:16:52.196
Supponiamo di prendere una lampadina:

00:16:52.523 --> 00:16:55.796
a quale scopo? Dobbiamo prendere
la lampadina, ma a quale scopo?

00:16:55.896 --> 00:16:57.578
Dobbiamo accendere la luce.

00:16:57.718 --> 00:17:00.650
Se però questa lampadina
non dà luce di nessun tipo,

00:17:00.705 --> 00:17:03.443
a che serve averla?

00:17:04.408 --> 00:17:08.115
Allo stesso modo,
a che serve venire in Sahaja Yoga

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:15.795
se non riuscite a diventare
la luce del Divino?

00:17:19.468 --> 00:17:24.500
So all of you, each one of you, is not at all a small person;

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:27.709
no one; but you don’t realize what you are;

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:32.542
still have those funny conditionings by which you think

00:17:32.542 --> 00:17:35.125
you are no good. All of you can come up,

00:17:35.125 --> 00:17:39.417
and see so many people. If they take to total benevolence

00:17:39.458 --> 00:17:47.125
within themselves it will manifest itself outside; absolutely; it’s a fact.

00:17:47.125 --> 00:17:52.875
Then the attention is very important.

00:17:52.917 --> 00:17:57.333
The attention should be on your own perfection

00:17:57.375 --> 00:18:03.917
and on your total benevolence. This is also another point people miss,

00:18:03.959 --> 00:18:06.500
that they start finding faults with others

00:18:06.542 --> 00:18:10.125
instead of finding faults with themselves.

00:18:10.166 --> 00:18:15.834
As a result, if you look at others, what will you get out of it?

00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:21.417
I just don’t understand. If somebody is wrong,

00:18:21.458 --> 00:18:24.959
he’s doing something evil, he's bad, even if you put attention to him,

00:18:24.959 --> 00:18:31.667
what will you do about it? But if you have something wrong,

00:18:31.709 --> 00:18:34.166
you have every right, you have every control,

00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:42.834
and you can correct yourself. This is especially Indian quality,

00:18:42.834 --> 00:18:44.999
is to find faults with others.

00:18:44.999 --> 00:18:49.417
They’ll never see that what’s wrong with us.

00:18:49.458 --> 00:18:55.375
All the time the attention is involved in finding with faults with others.

00:18:55.417 --> 00:19:02.333
Then how can we improve? On the contrary,

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:06.291
if you start seeing faults, you get faulty much more.

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:10.750
It’s a copycat nature of human beings.

00:19:10.792 --> 00:19:13.250
They see somebody doing like this,

00:19:13.291 --> 00:19:16.208
“Oh Mother, he’s a Sahaja yogi, he does like this,

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.417
so what’s the harm if I do?”

00:19:18.417 --> 00:19:20.667
But who says he’s a Sahaja yogi?

00:19:20.667 --> 00:19:24.625
So ‘Sahaja yogi’ is not a brand, it's not a certificate,

00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:31.417
it’s not a kind of a organization, but it is your own status

00:19:31.458 --> 00:19:34.917
that you have achieved. Anybody can say,

00:19:34.959 --> 00:19:37.792
“I’m a Sahaja Yogi.” After all I cannot stop him from saying.

00:19:37.834 --> 00:19:40.792
I’m not such a ...(unclear). Even I have seen some mad people,

00:19:40.792 --> 00:19:43.417
they are Sahaja yogis, for years together they’re mad,

00:19:43.458 --> 00:19:49.417
but they’re Sahaja yogis. But you have to see for yourself,

00:19:49.417 --> 00:19:52.500
am I a Sahaja yogi or not? Before certifying yourself,

00:19:52.542 --> 00:19:58.750
why don’t you find out? But despite that, I must say,

00:19:58.792 --> 00:20:04.208
it's such a satisfaction. I never expected that so many people

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:07.041
will get their realization to begin with, never.

00:20:07.083 --> 00:20:13.834
I mean, I knew that it was en masse modus operandi I have developed,

00:20:13.834 --> 00:20:19.166
but I never expected. But it has happened,

00:20:19.208 --> 00:20:24.875
and even now I have to expect that all of you

00:20:24.917 --> 00:20:29.750
will achieve the highest, highest positions, the paramapada (Sanskrit word),

00:20:29.750 --> 00:20:35.166
as I said, like the North Pole, or like the Meru; absolutely atala (Indian word)

00:20:35.208 --> 00:20:38.333
‘which cannot be disturbed’. So that’s My hope,

00:20:38.375 --> 00:20:41.166
and I’m sure you will all comply with it.

00:20:41.208 --> 00:21:09.999
(Talk continues in Marathi then returns to English)

00:31:55.542 --> 00:31:57.208
I’ll tell you in English. I have told you many a times

00:31:57.208 --> 00:32:00.291
about Namadeva and Gorakumbhar, how Gorakumbhar,

00:32:00.291 --> 00:32:03.583
when he saw Namadeva, Namadeva saw Gorakumbhar

00:32:03.625 --> 00:32:08.041
was kneading the clay for his pottery,

00:32:08.083 --> 00:32:11.834
he just went and stood before him stunned.

00:32:11.834 --> 00:32:20.041
And what he says that, “I have come to see here the formless”

00:32:20.083 --> 00:32:25.041
(that’s the vibrations). “But the Formless is in a form”

00:32:25.083 --> 00:32:28.750
This is the appreciation one should have,

00:32:28.792 --> 00:32:30.792
one Sahaja yogi should have for another.

00:32:30.834 --> 00:32:34.750
Every Sahaja yogi is a gem.

00:32:34.792 --> 00:32:40.208
Even the thought of a gem should bring joy to you.

00:32:40.250 --> 00:32:45.792
In every life, every style, in every areas, every dimensions,

00:32:45.834 --> 00:32:53.291
one should have this kind of a feeling. Muslims, Hindus, Christians,

00:32:53.333 --> 00:32:56.875
we do not accept. For us we are all Sahaja yogis,

00:32:56.917 --> 00:33:00.999
and we have faith in all the religions, not some above.

00:33:00.999 --> 00:33:04.999
We have faith in every thing. As well as we worship Rama

00:33:04.999 --> 00:33:09.500
we worship Muhammad Sahib also, same way, no less.

00:33:09.542 --> 00:33:13.333
As we worship Brahmadeva, or as we worship,

00:33:13.333 --> 00:33:18.166
we say, Dattatreya, we worship Zoroaster, there’s no difference at all,

00:33:18.208 --> 00:33:23.291
same way. There’s a big difference in having just a same,

00:33:23.291 --> 00:33:28.333
what you call, the same respect; it’s not that;

00:33:28.375 --> 00:33:32.834
but we worship the same way, so there’s no question

00:33:32.834 --> 00:33:37.333
of differentiating each other; nor on country-wise, nothing.

00:33:37.333 --> 00:33:40.750
And whatever defects we have, we see to it

00:33:40.792 --> 00:33:42.917
that this has come from our country;

00:33:42.959 --> 00:33:46.333
which I see many Sahaja yogis tell Me, “This is typical English,

00:33:46.375 --> 00:33:49.917
this is typically French, this is typically Italian.”

00:33:49.959 --> 00:33:56.041
They themselves tell Me. But main thing one has to understand is this,

00:33:56.083 --> 00:34:00.875
that in Sahaja Yoga we have lost all these boundaries; nothing is there.

00:34:00.917 --> 00:34:03.999
We have reached that state where we are all one.

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:09.458
And the idea of any Sahaja yogi whatsoever,

00:34:09.458 --> 00:34:12.291
and any individual Sahaja yogi, or a group of Sahaja yogis,

00:34:12.291 --> 00:34:21.208
should fill you up with joy and a kind of a wave of joy

00:34:21.208 --> 00:34:27.375
which is continuously coming, because they are in the form of joy,

00:34:27.417 --> 00:34:33.000
peace. If this appreciation is reached, then only one can say

00:34:33.041 --> 00:34:38.291
that you are Sahaja yogis, and that is one of the tests I have seen.

00:34:38.333 --> 00:34:40.834
You love Me very much I know, all of you,

00:34:40.834 --> 00:34:44.917
but unless and until you love each other how am I going to be happy?

00:34:44.917 --> 00:34:49.834
So today specially, this Mahalakshmi principle,

00:34:49.875 --> 00:34:55.000
when it is awakened within you, then you get out of a Lakshmi principle,

00:34:55.041 --> 00:34:57.999
which makes you a little selfish maybe, self-centered,

00:34:57.999 --> 00:35:01.875
and you get into a new dimension of searching,

00:35:01.917 --> 00:35:08.166
of searching the higher value system, something beyond,

00:35:08.208 --> 00:35:14.250
without any limitations. And that Mahalakshmi principle

00:35:14.291 --> 00:35:19.667
is really nothing, in essence, if you see, is nothing but you are seeking the universal love,

00:35:19.667 --> 00:35:26.667
in the essence it is that. We don’t love people

00:35:26.709 --> 00:35:30.041
because they belong to some country, because they look like this,

00:35:30.083 --> 00:35:32.875
that this is this; nothing; we love them

00:35:32.917 --> 00:35:38.875
only because they are our part and parcel, we are one with them.

00:35:38.917 --> 00:35:43.667
So those who are today worshipping Mahalakshmi should feel

00:35:43.667 --> 00:35:46.041
how many worshippers of Mahalakshmi are there,

00:35:46.041 --> 00:35:49.917
and they are all our own. It’s such a great feeling.

00:35:49.959 --> 00:35:56.792
Otherwise, in Maharashtra especially, I must say, it was horrible,

00:35:56.834 --> 00:36:01.000
one Sahaja yogi goes to preach in another Sahaj, another district.

00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:09.083
(Background noise) The district leader starts fighting, just like this sound,

00:36:09.083 --> 00:36:14.250
“Who are you to come here? I’m the leader”

00:36:14.291 --> 00:36:22.000
Instead of respecting him, and making him a welcome guest,

00:36:22.041 --> 00:36:26.917
asking him what can you help, there’s a big fight.

00:36:26.959 --> 00:36:32.999
It’s really surprising. How can it happen?

00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:38.291
When Namadeva went to Punjab, Guru Nanak Sahib respected him;

00:36:38.291 --> 00:36:40.709
not only that, but he told him that,

00:36:40.750 --> 00:36:43.458
“You write now in Punjabi language also.”

00:36:43.500 --> 00:36:47.041
I have seen such a big book written by Namadeva. Can you imagine?

00:36:47.041 --> 00:36:52.166
He included all the great saints of Maharashtra in his Granth Sahib,

00:36:52.208 --> 00:36:57.875
because he knew that these are realized souls, they are higher souls.

00:36:57.917 --> 00:37:01.917
But these Sikhs are only reading it; nothing goes into their heads.

00:37:01.959 --> 00:37:07.542
What can you do? So at that time,

00:37:07.542 --> 00:37:10.709
if these saints could love each other,

00:37:10.750 --> 00:37:16.375
could express themselves in such a manner, why not we,

00:37:16.375 --> 00:37:18.792
the Sahaja yogis from all over the world?

00:37:18.834 --> 00:37:23.834
So I would say now, that, let us see, it’s a very nice program of Ras

00:37:23.875 --> 00:37:28.959
(Indian word) we’ll be having, where all the Indian and foreign Sahaja yogis are going to be together,

00:37:28.999 --> 00:37:32.500
and are going to dance together. All such things are there.

00:37:32.542 --> 00:37:37.375
So don’t sit in groups, but mix up with others, know them,

00:37:37.417 --> 00:37:40.542
and this is what we are going to know;

00:37:40.583 --> 00:37:45.500
each and every Sahaja yogi of the whole world.

00:37:45.542 --> 00:37:51.125
Is very important for Me that you should love each other.

00:37:51.166 --> 00:37:55.917
It will really soothe Me the most, it will give Me the greatest joy,

00:37:55.959 --> 00:38:03.792
the greatest achievement, and the fulfillment of My life.

00:38:03.834 --> 00:38:11.542
If somebody is really, definitely wrong, you just write to Me

00:38:11.542 --> 00:38:15.208
and I will know, because immediately I’ll know from vibrations.

00:38:15.250 --> 00:38:17.375
Nobody can befool Me, that’s one thing for sure.

00:38:17.417 --> 00:38:19.667
Some people say that, “Somebody has told this to Mother.

00:38:19.709 --> 00:38:21.959
” Nothing can be told to Mother, you don’t know;

00:38:21.999 --> 00:38:25.625
I am too cunning for all this. Nobody can tell Me anything;

00:38:25.667 --> 00:38:28.041
I know each and every... I play around a little bit,

00:38:28.083 --> 00:38:31.667
but I know each and every person. I give them a chance

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:33.834
to hang themselves for a time being.

00:38:33.834 --> 00:38:38.125
But never believe that anybody can befool Me, and tell anything.

00:38:38.125 --> 00:38:47.709
I listen to everyone, and you can try that.

00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:52.333
If you love another Sahaja yogi,

00:38:52.333 --> 00:38:57.458
this loving process itself is so joy giving.

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:04.625
When you first saw Me this time on the stage, you felt that way,

00:39:04.667 --> 00:39:11.166
because this process of loving is the greatest joy-giving thing.

00:39:11.208 --> 00:39:16.999
So be happy, be joyous. If some people are missing the plane,

00:39:16.999 --> 00:39:19.917
well and good, you will live with other Sahaja yogis,

00:39:19.959 --> 00:39:23.375
you are after all, you are somewhere in the world, you are not lost.

00:39:23.375 --> 00:39:26.750
Even if you are in the sea, you are there, on the plane you are there.

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:32.500
What does it matter? Why is it so important

00:39:32.542 --> 00:39:36.417
that this plane must be reserved, and you must worry about this plane,

00:39:36.458 --> 00:39:39.291
“I must get out at this time” There’s no need.

00:39:39.291 --> 00:39:43.083
Wherever you are you are with Sahaja yogis,

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:44.959
so why worry?

00:39:44.959 --> 00:39:50.750
You are, that’s the point. Like many people ask Me,

00:39:50.750 --> 00:39:53.291
“Mother You travel so much, how is it You don’t get tired?”

00:39:53.291 --> 00:39:55.917
Because I never think I am travelling, I just think, “I am,”

00:39:55.959 --> 00:39:58.917
that’s all. Whether in the plane or here, or there,

00:39:58.917 --> 00:40:03.375
I am just there. I have to tell Me I am traveling,

00:40:03.375 --> 00:40:09.041
then again I forget. So you are,

00:40:09.083 --> 00:40:12.792
whether you are here or in England, or anywhere,

00:40:12.834 --> 00:40:18.667
or you are here or you are there. So why to worry?

00:40:18.667 --> 00:40:21.458
Specially with the plane - I think there is something wrong

00:40:21.458 --> 00:40:27.625
with the Western genetics - the plane enters into their Kundalini,

00:40:27.667 --> 00:40:31.999
I think, and they go so bizarre with the airplanes.

00:40:31.999 --> 00:40:35.500
Something I’ve never been able to understand it.

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:38.959
I’ve given them so many lessons to show that don’t do all this nonsense,

00:40:38.999 --> 00:40:41.083
but still they go on doing like this.

00:40:41.125 --> 00:40:44.375
But if I tell them they feel guilty,but again they do it.

00:40:44.417 --> 00:40:47.834
Next time if your plane is eight o’clock,

00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:52.500
go at nine o’clock, the plane will wait for you till ten o’clock,

00:40:52.542 --> 00:40:57.125
take it from Me. It has happened; so many can tell this.

00:40:57.166 --> 00:41:03.208
So many experiences are there. I mean, we haven’t written them down,

00:41:03.250 --> 00:41:07.208
but people know how planes have been delayed for us.

00:41:07.208 --> 00:41:11.375
I have never missed a plane all My life, and when I missed it,

00:41:11.375 --> 00:41:13.917
it was with a purpose; these big things happened.

00:41:13.917 --> 00:41:17.125
So it is important, it’s a drama.

00:41:17.166 --> 00:41:24.917
The worry should be one:

00:41:24.959 --> 00:41:32.542
“Why can’t I love everyone as I love myself?”

00:41:32.542 --> 00:41:39.750
I tell you only this universal love will give you

00:41:39.792 --> 00:41:45.041
that confidence and that higher status.

00:41:45.083 --> 00:41:47.750
Why these saints suffered for you?

00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:52.125
Why did Christ suffer for you?

00:41:52.125 --> 00:41:53.750
Why Muhammad Sahib suffered for you?

00:41:53.792 --> 00:41:56.166
Why anybody talked to you about Dharma?

00:41:56.208 --> 00:42:01.125
Why Gnaneshwara wrote Gnaneshwari? Why?

00:42:01.166 --> 00:42:03.250
What did they get?

00:42:03.291 --> 00:42:10.500
This satisfaction of their expression of universal love.

00:42:10.542 --> 00:42:14.959
All the great poets, William Blake or anyone,

00:42:14.959 --> 00:42:17.208
whatever they have done, it’s just

00:42:17.208 --> 00:42:21.250
because they have this universal love and they want to express it.

00:42:21.291 --> 00:42:22.959
Why not you do it?

00:42:22.999 --> 00:42:27.999
So if you want your Mahalakshmi principle

00:42:28.041 --> 00:42:31.667
to be all the time burning, then please

00:42:31.709 --> 00:42:35.792
see that you love each and every Sahaja yogi.

00:42:35.834 --> 00:42:38.542
That’s the message today. I hope you’ll understand that.

00:42:38.583 --> 00:42:41.417
May God bless you.
