WEBVTT

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:18.909
Every time I face the new people, I have to
give an introductory talk and Sahaj Yogis

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:26.570
get sometimes impatient about it.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:37.090
But we have to understand that this is the
knowledge of the Divine

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.250
and those who have not known about it are
to be told.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.350
And those who have known should know that
there are many things they have not known,

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.279
which they have to know.

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:57.790
Still there is a lot to be known.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:06.700
Supposing I tell you all about it and you
do not get your Realisation, you do not get

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.960
your yoga, you do not get your connection
with the Divine then it is useless.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.420
Talk will remain talk.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.220
You may verify it; you may find it the same
written in many scriptures.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.720
Many saints have told you the same thing [but]
it has no use.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:41.800
The knowledge, gyana, is useless without yoga,
without the union with the Divine.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:48.700
When you get the yoga, also, when you are
realised, you get your Realisation, and I

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.700
do not give you the knowledge, then your Realisation is also useless.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.970
I have seen in this great country many realised-souls
are born.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:06.930
They live as realised-souls, they don’t
know what are they; they act as spiritualists,

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.110
they call themselves, whatever people call
them.

00:02:11.477 --> 00:02:17.117
But they are not aware that they are realised-souls!

00:02:17.117 --> 00:02:32.796
They commit mistakes, they go onto wrong paths,
get confused about their Realisation.

00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:45.766
So, it is necessary also to know what have
they got, what does it mean, how to use it,

00:02:45.766 --> 00:02:54.889
how to go ahead with it and how to develop.

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:58.708
Many people who have been here in this hall
have got Realisation.

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:07.438
Once they get Realisation, they feel so satisfied
about it that they just don’t come next time.

00:03:08.398 --> 00:03:14.708
And sometimes, after a year or two years they appear saying that, “Mother, we are again lost."

00:03:15.429 --> 00:03:27.729
So, to get Realisation is the most important
thing, absolutely important because if you

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.029
do not start your car, you do not move.

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:35.979
You [may] go on describing everything that,
“Now here we are on Leicester Square.

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:38.347
Now we are here!”

00:03:38.547 --> 00:03:42.398
But you are not there, you’re just talking.

00:03:42.398 --> 00:03:50.447
The car has to move first, has to start and
when the car has started then you must also

00:03:50.447 --> 00:03:54.477
know the roads, how to go.

00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:59.187
Then the car starts and bumps into something,
then you feel that, “What has happened?

00:03:59.187 --> 00:04:00.367
Our car has started!”

00:04:00.367 --> 00:04:09.008
So, these are two things: one is the yoga
– is the Realisation, through awakening

00:04:09.008 --> 00:04:19.568
of your Kundalini and the other is the gyana
(knowledge), which is the part which gives

00:04:19.568 --> 00:04:26.327
you complete knowledge and mastery over your
powers.

00:04:26.327 --> 00:04:34.588
For example, you go to a house and the lady
gives you the keys, “All right this is your

00:04:34.588 --> 00:04:35.588
house.

00:04:35.588 --> 00:04:36.927
You use it as you like it."

00:04:36.927 --> 00:04:40.658
Say, I come to England and somebody gives
me the keys.

00:04:40.658 --> 00:04:44.987
I don’t know how to use a washing machine!

00:04:44.987 --> 00:04:47.688
And I don’t know how to use the oven!

00:04:47.688 --> 00:04:54.588
Though she has given me the keys, I have entered
into it, I should know how to use it.

00:04:54.588 --> 00:05:04.218
I should know also what are the don’ts and
what are the dos.

00:05:04.218 --> 00:05:11.068
Before entering into the house, what’s the
use of knowing, also?

00:05:11.068 --> 00:05:17.228
Of course, it may help you, if you have a
little knowledge about it.

00:05:17.228 --> 00:05:23.598
But you cannot practise anything because you
have not entered inside it.

00:05:23.598 --> 00:05:28.647
The machinery is not before you, you are not
facing it.

00:05:28.647 --> 00:05:40.918
So, in Sahaj Yoga one has to first get into
[the] Self-realised state and then should

00:05:40.918 --> 00:05:53.328
know thoroughly how to use that state, or
how to be in that state, how to manifest it,

00:05:53.328 --> 00:05:58.078
improve it and stabilise it.

00:05:58.078 --> 00:06:04.107
For this you cannot go into courses – that
is for definite.

00:06:04.107 --> 00:06:08.463
“Should we do fourteen courses outside?”

00:06:08.467 --> 00:06:11.723
Has nothing to do with Sahaj Yoga.

00:06:12.983 --> 00:06:18.933
You have to get the keys.

00:06:19.103 --> 00:06:26.173
Secondly, you cannot pay any money for it,
you cannot purchase it.

00:06:26.173 --> 00:06:34.653
It is very difficult for human beings to understand
this part: that you cannot pay for it.

00:06:34.803 --> 00:06:41.544
That is one place where you cannot pay and
purchase.

00:06:41.544 --> 00:06:50.474
It is not that you are going to judge the
Sahaj Yoga, but Sahaj Yoga is going to judge you.

00:06:50.664 --> 00:06:53.754
It’s just the other way around.

00:06:53.754 --> 00:07:01.224
It is not that you are going to purchase Sahaj
Yoga, but Sahaj Yoga has to purchase you and

00:07:01.224 --> 00:07:04.963
has to accept you.

00:07:04.963 --> 00:07:12.213
It is very easy to do any other nonsense:
just you pay the money and you are there enrolled,

00:07:12.213 --> 00:07:13.213
permanently.

00:07:13.213 --> 00:07:17.804
You become the member of any group, very easy.

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:21.803
And you can club together and be satisfied,
“Oh, we are this and that!”

00:07:21.803 --> 00:07:27.034
You can brand yourself as anything but not
as Sahaj Yogis, unless and until you have

00:07:27.034 --> 00:07:30.623
got it.

00:07:30.623 --> 00:07:49.774
It is that essential, that authentic, that
intrinsic, that innate, that you have to be

00:07:49.774 --> 00:07:50.774
that.

00:07:50.774 --> 00:07:57.794
You can be an Englishman if you get a British
passport.

00:07:57.794 --> 00:08:03.414
You can be a director anywhere if you can
qualify for that.

00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:14.683
But you cannot be a Sahaj Yogi by doing anything
that you have been doing to achieve for worldly

00:08:14.683 --> 00:08:22.373
things or worldly positions, worldly possessions.

00:08:22.373 --> 00:08:31.013
We see so many such phenomena in our life
that we cannot see or cannot manoeuvre, cannot

00:08:31.083 --> 00:08:42.253
do  a flower manifest into a fruit.

00:08:42.736 --> 00:08:53.907
As we cannot germinate a seed, we cannot do
this living thing, which has to be done by

00:08:53.907 --> 00:09:02.246
Divine power and not by human power.

00:09:02.246 --> 00:09:12.917
Once you get it, the Divine power starts flowing through you, then you can also charge the dynamo.

00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:15.844
There is no false certificate that can be
given.

00:09:15.934 --> 00:09:21.604
You may be having a son who is not realised:
you may stand on your head or do whatever

00:09:21.604 --> 00:09:26.874
you please, you just cannot certify unless
and until he has got it.

00:09:26.874 --> 00:09:30.125
It is such a strange thing, so unique.

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:36.204
But do you know: this is what you are seeking.

00:09:36.204 --> 00:09:44.783
The rest of the things can be sought.

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:57.914
This is the thing which can only be requested
for, to be prayed for, to be asked for.

00:09:57.914 --> 00:09:59.413
You cannot demand it.

00:09:59.413 --> 00:10:04.784
Only the grace of God can work it out.

00:10:04.784 --> 00:10:13.744
Today I happened to read Bible, part of it,
and I was amazed how John has revealed so

00:10:13.744 --> 00:10:20.434
many things about chakras and this; but of
course, in a very mystic language.

00:10:20.434 --> 00:10:33.204
He calls chakras as the plug/plaque in his
dream he saw, and the deities as the angels.

00:10:33.204 --> 00:10:41.264
He has also described the Realisation.

00:10:41.264 --> 00:10:43.774
It is so wonderful to read it.

00:10:43.774 --> 00:10:53.594
But only after Realisation you’ll understand,
because it’s a very, very deep writing and

00:10:53.594 --> 00:11:05.454
you cannot read much from it – mystical
sounding, vague words.

00:11:05.454 --> 00:11:15.854
Now, we are here to seek ourselves.

00:11:15.854 --> 00:11:20.184
Everybody is floating an enterprise like that,
everybody is saying, “Oh, we are here to

00:11:20.184 --> 00:11:22.984
help you to seek yourself."

00:11:22.984 --> 00:11:25.504
I may be one of them, too.

00:11:25.504 --> 00:11:27.674
Why should you believe me, in any case?

00:11:27.674 --> 00:11:35.374
The first thought that will come into your
mind is, “Why should we believe Mataji?”

00:11:35.374 --> 00:11:41.533
If you believe in me blindly, it is not going
to help me at all.

00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:47.874
Neither it is going to help me, if you are
going to deny.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:56.153
Like a scientist just keep your eyes open,
keep your mind open, because this is what

00:11:56.153 --> 00:11:59.775
you are seeking, not just in this lifetime.

00:11:59.865 --> 00:12:07.574
You have been seeking for ages and unless
and until you get it you are not going to

00:12:07.574 --> 00:12:12.774
be satisfied, you are not going to find your
fulfilment.

00:12:12.774 --> 00:12:14.565
This has to happen to you.

00:12:14.595 --> 00:12:18.805
I don’t know how far Gavin has been able to explain to you

00:12:18.837 --> 00:12:25.675
 what to expect out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:26.435 --> 00:12:35.985
But it is the actualisation of this experience
I’m talking about, which has to work out.

00:12:35.985 --> 00:12:51.105
Here you see they have drawn a human being,
as he exists, with his Divine instrument within

00:12:51.105 --> 00:12:52.105
himself.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:13:02.324
These are the patterns of the energies which
are undercurrent of the sympathetic and parasympathetic

00:13:02.324 --> 00:13:06.204
nervous system.

00:13:06.204 --> 00:13:14.264
The sympathetic nervous system is managed
by two channels within us.

00:13:14.264 --> 00:13:25.315
One, on the left hand side that you see with the blue line, is the power to desire: 

00:13:25.315 --> 00:13:28.905
is called as kriya shakti.

00:13:28.905 --> 00:13:40.435
And the other one, on the right hand side,
with the yellow line, is the power to act,

00:13:40.435 --> 00:13:42.905
which is called as the kriya shakti.

00:13:42.905 --> 00:13:47.725
The first one is called as the ichcha shakti.

00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:52.944
First one has to desire and then he acts.

00:13:52.944 --> 00:14:01.415
And these two powers exist within us as left
and right sympathetic nervous system, which

00:14:01.415 --> 00:14:07.705
doctors can see outside the spinal cord, but
this is inside the spinal cord and inside

00:14:07.705 --> 00:14:11.465
the cranial bones, inside the brain as you
can see there.

00:14:11.465 --> 00:14:21.545
These all can be related to the gross nervous
system that doctors can see.

00:14:21.545 --> 00:14:25.785
But they are subtle energies within us.

00:14:25.785 --> 00:14:33.765
The one which runs on the left hand side is
connected with the seventh chakras down below;

00:14:33.765 --> 00:14:41.545
or you can call it the first chakra.

00:14:41.545 --> 00:14:49.002
This gives us desire to live and also desire
to die.

00:14:49.032 --> 00:15:02.225
All desires give us emotions, it gives us
existence and when we deny our existence,

00:15:02.255 --> 00:15:05.093
then it gives us death.

00:15:05.183 --> 00:15:14.844
The other one is the power of action for which
we use our physical being and our mental being.

00:15:14.844 --> 00:15:20.334
So, this represents our physical and mental being.

00:15:20.334 --> 00:15:29.454
The central one is called as the path of knowledge: gyana shakti.

00:15:29.454 --> 00:15:37.204
But the knowledge we know of is very different
from the knowledge I am talking about.

00:15:37.204 --> 00:15:44.623
I mean the subjective knowledge that we have
achieved as human beings through our evolution.

00:15:44.623 --> 00:15:57.294
For example, a human being is much higher
in his awareness than the animal.

00:15:57.294 --> 00:16:02.644
His awareness is the thing that he has achieved
through his evolution, which is built in him,

00:16:02.644 --> 00:16:04.034
which acts subjectively.

00:16:07.834 --> 00:16:18.904
For example, supposing you take a rose flower:

00:16:18.935 --> 00:16:25.243
 you know it is a rose flower and you enjoy it.

00:16:25.243 --> 00:16:31.534
But for an animal, it makes no difference
whether it is filth or a garden, it can pass

00:16:31.534 --> 00:16:34.734
through it most unawares.

00:16:34.734 --> 00:16:45.894
So, your gyana shakti means your awareness or your knowledge – knowledge that is awareness,

00:16:45.884 --> 00:16:52.113
human awareness – is developed to a point and 

00:16:52.149 --> 00:16:56.849
still has to develop more, has to manifest more.

00:16:56.861 --> 00:17:00.001
It has to have another dimension.

00:17:00.001 --> 00:17:12.731
Because of a certain gap in between – you
can see the central line; this green gap gives

00:17:12.731 --> 00:17:26.540
you the Void – gives you an awareness which is not yet complete.

00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:36.280
The completion of human awareness can only be achieved if he reaches the absolute point.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:45.650
Supposing you have not reached the absolute point then whatever you are talking is relative.

00:17:45.650 --> 00:17:48.840
Relative to relative creates confusion.

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:59.900
So, the idea of righteousness, idea of holiness,
idea of sin, everything is relative.

00:17:59.900 --> 00:18:11.970
You have to reach that absolute point by which
you judge whether it is holiness or not, whether

00:18:11.970 --> 00:18:15.270
it is sinful or not.

00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:18.330
That we have to reach.

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:26.640
That absolute point is within us, placed in
our heart, which is called as the Spirit and

00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.280
is the reflection of God Almighty.

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:37.320
In Sanskrit language it is called as Atma.

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:47.780
That Spirit resides within us, it watches
all our activities, it knows everything about

00:18:47.780 --> 00:19:00.170
us and it informs the lowest chakra there,
which records everything that we do – all

00:19:00.170 --> 00:19:06.890
our conditionings, all our ego-trips – to
that three and a half-coiled energy, which

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:09.530
we call as Kundalini.

00:19:09.530 --> 00:19:11.420
‘Kundalini’ means coils.

00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:17.900
This is the Kundalini, as called as the Serpent
power.

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.689
Now, horrible things have been said and written about Kundalini.

00:19:22.679 --> 00:19:27.600
When I read, I mean when I even heard about it, 

00:19:27.630 --> 00:19:35.100
I was really shocked about the naive description of it!

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:43.360
I’ve always said that it is like a villager
going in the city and putting both the hands

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:47.471
into the plug and saying that, “Electricity
I know, don’t tell me about it!

00:19:47.471 --> 00:19:52.329
You see what happens, it gives you a shock 

00:19:52.419 --> 00:19:56.479
and you just fall back and you break your neck."

00:19:56.599 --> 00:20:05.968
Those who do not know about Kundalini have written about Kundalini because this is the

00:20:05.978 --> 00:20:08.960
only area where nobody can control you.

00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.810
You can write anything about God, against God, 

00:20:12.997 --> 00:20:17.150
or do whatever you please, who can check you?

00:20:17.283 --> 00:20:19.327
There is no law which forbids.

00:20:21.357 --> 00:20:25.834
You can write about Kundalini whatever you feel like.

00:20:25.834 --> 00:20:28.674
She is your Mother.

00:20:28.718 --> 00:20:32.498
She has been born with you several times.

00:20:32.528 --> 00:20:36.438
She is the one who is going to give you Realisation.

00:20:36.488 --> 00:20:41.948
And do you think your Kundalini is going to harm you by any chance?

00:20:42.058 --> 00:20:43.798
Is going to torture you?

00:20:43.878 --> 00:20:45.908
Is going to trouble you?

00:20:46.593 --> 00:20:56.783
And if you have to achieve the highest through the Divine love of God,

00:20:57.633 --> 00:21:00.943
 is it going to be torturesome?

00:21:00.943 --> 00:21:06.735
Did you get this nose and these eyes and mouth and everything that you have as a human being

00:21:06.733 --> 00:21:09.435
out of some tortures?

00:21:09.483 --> 00:21:13.583
You never even felt how it has happened!

00:21:13.613 --> 00:21:19.803
How gentle it is, how kind it is!

00:21:22.493 --> 00:21:28.403
It is your Mother who is sitting there waiting for a moment to rise.

00:21:28.403 --> 00:21:35.372
Now the whole thing sounds very poetic to a scientific mind.

00:21:35.372 --> 00:21:39.163
But poetry is also a part of human beings.

00:21:42.025 --> 00:21:45.265
If it sounds poetic.

00:21:45.265 --> 00:21:51.745
It is the poetic work, of the Kundalini.

00:21:51.745 --> 00:21:57.115
God is not only science; he is also love,
beauty.

00:21:57.135 --> 00:22:03.565
He is not only dry truth; He is also joy.

00:22:03.675 --> 00:22:07.175
He is joy.

00:22:07.195 --> 00:22:14.815
He’s joy, because he is truth, He’s truth
because He’s beauty.

00:22:15.995 --> 00:22:26.565
So, when the Kundalini rises within you through
these six centres that are shown here, it

00:22:26.565 --> 00:22:36.705
pierces this area, which is called as the
fontanel bone and gives you Self-realisation.

00:22:36.705 --> 00:22:42.397
This is called as baptism.

00:22:42.517 --> 00:22:49.061
You cannot go to a theological college and become a Baptist.

00:22:49.261 --> 00:22:53.782
Nobody can brand you a Baptist.

00:22:53.782 --> 00:22:55.722
You have to be realised.

00:22:55.722 --> 00:23:03.212
This fontanel bone area has to be pierced
through by the Kundalini, then only you become

00:23:03.212 --> 00:23:06.362
one with the All-pervading Power, with that
subtle power.

00:23:06.362 --> 00:23:13.092
It has to happen; this germination has to
take place within you.

00:23:13.092 --> 00:23:22.472
You are still at a seed stage and just by
branding a seed you do not become a tree.

00:23:22.472 --> 00:23:32.572
So, it has to happen within us, and has to
happen beautifully, and spontaneously, because

00:23:32.572 --> 00:23:39.502
it is a living process of evolution.

00:23:39.502 --> 00:23:46.391
We have evolved into human beings from amoeba: nobody has done anything about it.

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:57.592
And we are not going to do anything about
becoming that for which we are made.

00:23:57.592 --> 00:24:04.302
Somebody who has created this machinery is
going to put you through to the mains if he

00:24:04.302 --> 00:24:06.462
wants to use it.

00:24:06.462 --> 00:24:12.452
But in between there’s a little problem.

00:24:12.452 --> 00:24:20.602
Everything was ready, just perfect, just to
be connected to the mains.

00:24:20.602 --> 00:24:26.752
But the instrument was given the freedom to
choose.

00:24:26.752 --> 00:24:35.582
That is important for evolution, very important,
that you should be given the freedom, a complete

00:24:35.582 --> 00:24:39.522
freedom to choose whether it is right or wrong.

00:24:39.522 --> 00:24:44.252
Nobody can force that onto you.

00:24:45.852 --> 00:24:49.812
In all your freedom you have to choose whether 

00:24:49.842 --> 00:24:53.392
you want to enter into the Kingdom of God or not.

00:24:53.642 --> 00:24:59.221
Nobody’s going to force you there, to enter.

00:24:59.221 --> 00:25:07.122
It has to be your desire; it has to be your
asking.

00:25:07.122 --> 00:25:20.142
And for that freedom has been given to use
these two powers of your desire and of your

00:25:20.142 --> 00:25:37.822
action which gives you the idea of your accelerator
and of your brake: to know how to drive your

00:25:37.822 --> 00:25:57.012
own car, so that the master behind it hands
over the keys to you and car to you.

00:25:57.012 --> 00:26:05.931
It was necessary for you to learn these two
powers, to be managed.

00:26:05.971 --> 00:26:15.651
But in your freedom and in understanding yourself you have committed mistakes; you have bumped

00:26:15.651 --> 00:26:16.651
your cars too much.

00:26:16.651 --> 00:26:23.311
It was said that: keep in the centre, do not
go too much left or to the right or you’ll

00:26:23.311 --> 00:26:24.651
get into bumps.

00:26:24.651 --> 00:26:28.171
Either you went into the left or to the right.

00:26:28.171 --> 00:26:33.651
And when you tried to correct your right you
went into the left, to another extreme.

00:26:33.651 --> 00:26:36.051
To correct to the left you went to the right.

00:26:36.051 --> 00:26:39.831
By going to the extremes, you will be bumping
your car.

00:26:39.831 --> 00:26:49.291
And this is exactly what has happened to us
– doesn’t matter.

00:26:49.291 --> 00:26:53.961
The car has to be repaired; it has to be done.

00:26:53.961 --> 00:26:57.951
A little patience can work it out.

00:26:57.951 --> 00:27:03.931
There’s nothing to get annoyed with oneself.

00:27:05.696 --> 00:27:10.536
When the car starts it goes very fast.

00:27:10.536 --> 00:27:18.686
Then you should know how to slow it down, how to organise it. 

00:27:18.816 --> 00:27:25.946
Then you have to become the authority, yourself,
of discrimination.

00:27:25.936 --> 00:27:29.780
I don’t have to tell you that this is not
good or that is not good.

00:27:29.805 --> 00:27:31.616
How is it possible?

00:27:32.526 --> 00:27:42.705
Because you become one with the Divine, you
become one with the Primordial Being, with

00:27:42.705 --> 00:27:53.136
the Great Being, with the Akbar, and you start
acting according to that.

00:27:53.136 --> 00:28:02.406
A subjective manifestation of your awareness
takes place by which you understand what’s

00:28:02.406 --> 00:28:07.736
wrong with you and what’s wrong with others.

00:28:07.736 --> 00:28:13.266
It is so precise and correct.

00:28:13.266 --> 00:28:20.196
You just feel on your hands, on your fingers
as shown, all the centres that are within

00:28:20.196 --> 00:28:24.386
you, which are created out of different elements.

00:28:24.386 --> 00:28:29.335
Immediately you know what is in imbalance, what is more, what is less, left is more or

00:28:29.335 --> 00:28:33.516
right is more, what is wrong with you.

00:28:33.516 --> 00:28:37.465
Even a born-realised child, say, of two years
who can talk, can tell you what’s wrong,

00:28:37.465 --> 00:28:38.958
because it’s subjective.

00:28:38.958 --> 00:28:45.379
You start feeling it: this is happening, that
is happening.

00:28:45.379 --> 00:28:57.389
All this understanding comes to you because
it is Self-knowledge.

00:28:57.389 --> 00:29:04.259
But when you know about yourself you also
know about others, because you jump into collective

00:29:04.259 --> 00:29:08.228
consciousness.

00:29:08.228 --> 00:29:12.712
You ‘jump into’, I say.

00:29:12.749 --> 00:29:14.722
You become collectively conscious.

00:29:14.769 --> 00:29:21.779
It is not that I say, “We are all brothers
and sisters,” have United Nations for it

00:29:21.779 --> 00:29:24.599
and use it for giving jobs to everyone.

00:29:24.798 --> 00:29:26.839
It’s not that way.

00:29:26.936 --> 00:29:30.906
It’s an actualisation that takes place:
you just become.

00:29:30.896 --> 00:29:34.242
Jolly well you’ll have to feel it.

00:29:34.535 --> 00:29:36.332
You cannot get rid of it.

00:29:36.335 --> 00:29:38.412
It becomes your awareness.

00:29:40.295 --> 00:29:44.282
You just feel it and that’s how you correct it.

00:29:45.676 --> 00:29:49.086
Everybody is a part and parcel of that Great
Being.

00:29:49.086 --> 00:29:55.156
As this finger can feel this finger; and as,
when it is hurt, this finger goes to sooth

00:29:55.156 --> 00:30:01.806
it, in the same way the whole is more important
than individual.

00:30:01.806 --> 00:30:08.936
So, when we are seeking our wholesomeness
we have to know that, only through Self-realisation,

00:30:08.936 --> 00:30:14.015
by becoming one with the Self, you are going
to get it.

00:30:14.015 --> 00:30:18.735
Talks, talks, talks – we have had many.

00:30:18.735 --> 00:30:22.115
Let’s have the real and get it.

00:30:22.115 --> 00:30:25.186
You cannot argue about it.

00:30:25.186 --> 00:30:31.306
It happens, especially in this country I have
seen, because you are great thinkers and analysers.

00:30:31.306 --> 00:30:36.015
Everything you try to analyse.

00:30:36.015 --> 00:30:41.536
But this is beyond your thinking.

00:30:41.536 --> 00:30:44.223
You go beyond your rationality.

00:30:44.303 --> 00:30:49.933
Because rationality is limited and you have
to be triggered into something unlimited,

00:30:49.933 --> 00:30:54.583
so you have to leave that.

00:30:54.583 --> 00:30:59.122
You have to go into that space.

00:30:59.143 --> 00:31:01.263
You cannot explain it by thinking.

00:31:02.443 --> 00:31:10.132
But then, when it starts flowing through you,
you use your rationality to understand, “Why

00:31:10.132 --> 00:31:13.813
this finger is burning?”

00:31:13.813 --> 00:31:18.063
It is decoded in Sahaj Yoga.

00:31:18.063 --> 00:31:42.353
In Sahaj Yoga you know all the decoding of all the signals you get from the Absolute.

00:31:42.383 --> 00:31:44.223
Your computer starts working.

00:31:44.252 --> 00:31:50.663
But who has to decode the computer and the
numbers?

00:31:50.663 --> 00:31:54.073
All that is explained.

00:31:54.073 --> 00:31:58.732
That is what you have to learn, that is known
as gyana.

00:31:58.732 --> 00:32:02.742
After Realisation what one has to do?

00:32:02.742 --> 00:32:06.403
Also, a point comes up sometimes.

00:32:06.403 --> 00:32:10.533
Supposing, I have enlightened this one (candle), now what have we to do?

00:32:10.543 --> 00:32:11.923
Is to give light.

00:32:11.943 --> 00:32:13.463
What a question!

00:32:13.723 --> 00:32:19.733
When you are enlightened, after enlightenment
what do you do?

00:32:19.733 --> 00:32:21.633
Is to give light, that’s all.

00:32:21.633 --> 00:32:25.543
That’s your job, is to give light.

00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:32.502
But how to manoeuvre it, how to organise it
– that’s the thing you have to learn,

00:32:32.502 --> 00:32:38.002
for which I’m willing to work very hard.

00:32:38.002 --> 00:32:49.132
And everything that I say, you have to verify
it, and you have to see for yourself.

00:32:49.132 --> 00:32:55.033
After Realisation, if you start doubting – we
had people who started doubting – and what

00:32:55.033 --> 00:32:56.132
are you doubting here?

00:32:56.132 --> 00:32:58.173
I don’t want anything from you.

00:32:58.173 --> 00:33:08.012
I am sitting here just to give, not to take
anything, then what are you doubting about?

00:33:08.012 --> 00:33:12.543
They start doubting and the progress is much
less.

00:33:12.543 --> 00:33:21.433
But some people are of very high calibre in
this country, are of a very great high calibre,

00:33:21.433 --> 00:33:24.553
and once they get it, they just get it like that.

00:33:25.123 --> 00:33:31.942
You will be amazed, there was one gentleman
who went to someone and was ditched and deceived

00:33:31.942 --> 00:33:40.493
and absolutely he was looted: he just saw
my photograph.

00:33:40.493 --> 00:33:47.483
There are, Gavin himself has got his Realisation
only through my photograph.

00:33:47.483 --> 00:33:52.883
There are many here who have got it through
my photograph only.

00:33:52.883 --> 00:33:54.903
But they are people of calibre.

00:33:54.903 --> 00:34:01.084
So, I said that Sahaj Yoga is going to judge
you and you are not going to judge Sahaj Yoga:

00:34:01.103 --> 00:34:02.494
you cannot.

00:34:02.564 --> 00:34:04.204
You cannot measure it.

00:34:04.253 --> 00:34:06.511
It is an ocean.

00:34:06.663 --> 00:34:09.523
Just enjoy it and be your Self.

00:34:09.751 --> 00:34:14.061
It’s a gift for which you have been asking,
so just take it.

00:34:14.141 --> 00:34:24.241
It’s absolutely free, you cannot pay it and don’t think on these hopeless worldly ways.

00:34:25.029 --> 00:34:32.469
It is the love of God, the grace of God, which one has to receive.

00:34:32.469 --> 00:34:34.149
Just enjoy it.

00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:35.489
Just have it.

00:34:37.609 --> 00:34:44.509
That’s what it is and we should work it
out.

00:34:44.509 --> 00:34:52.589
Now I had a system, especially in these countries, that people can ask me questions.

00:34:52.609 --> 00:34:58.599
But it happened like that, that questions
were asked by extremely negative people mostly.

00:34:58.599 --> 00:35:04.599
I would answer them, they would take everybody’s
time who were anxious to have Realisation.

00:35:04.599 --> 00:35:08.609
And then just as soon as we started, “All
right let’s have the Realisation,” the

00:35:08.609 --> 00:35:11.346
person would get up and go away.

00:35:11.363 --> 00:35:12.966
It’s common practice.

00:35:13.413 --> 00:35:20.373
The person is not at all interested in Self-realisation, seems to be more interested in questions.

00:35:20.373 --> 00:35:26.445
And, sort of, you give more chance to a person who is negative and useless than to people

00:35:26.453 --> 00:35:28.535
who really want Realisation.

00:35:28.943 --> 00:35:35.913
Now, if there is a question, I still would
like you to ask me, no doubt, but be sensible

00:35:35.943 --> 00:35:37.993
and considerate.

00:35:38.863 --> 00:35:40.445
Thank you very much.

00:35:40.503 --> 00:35:42.245
May God bless you all!

00:35:56.407 --> 00:35:59.778
Be considerate when you ask a question, but ask.

00:35:59.817 --> 00:36:05.727
It’s nice to ask, you know, because I have
no questions, that’s the problem.

00:36:15.487 --> 00:36:18.377
Not to fear, please ask the question.

00:36:18.413 --> 00:36:20.567
Lady from the audience: Have a question.

00:36:20.589 --> 00:36:23.627
Shri Mataji: You have been always asking,
I am not going to allow this time.

00:36:23.647 --> 00:36:24.677
She is useless.

00:36:24.697 --> 00:36:25.727
You asked me.

00:36:25.857 --> 00:36:27.007
Somebody else should ask me.

00:36:27.007 --> 00:36:29.895
Her questions are always like that, has no
meaning.

00:36:29.897 --> 00:36:32.215
You’d better get your Realisation, perfected.

00:36:32.237 --> 00:36:33.237
Anybody else?

00:36:34.724 --> 00:36:35.724
Ask.

00:36:35.724 --> 00:36:40.686
She has been every time asking questions,
but you don’t want to perfect your Realisation.

00:36:40.704 --> 00:36:43.176
You must perfect your Realisation.

00:36:43.704 --> 00:36:45.586
Yes please.

00:36:46.804 --> 00:36:51.005
Yes, ask me, loudly.

00:36:59.041 --> 00:37:06.751
Seeker: I’ll try not to be negative but
I’ve tried a few different organisations

00:37:06.821 --> 00:37:13.771
and I’ve searched quite a lot of different
organisations

00:37:13.783 --> 00:37:16.533
Shri Mataji: I can see that.

00:37:16.683 --> 00:37:18.403
All right

00:37:20.898 --> 00:37:35.499
Seeker: and always I come to the same question that people who are interested in truth, how

00:37:35.558 --> 00:37:40.399
could they come to such an organisation as
yours?

00:37:40.584 --> 00:37:42.954
Shri Mataji: I have no organisation.

00:37:42.984 --> 00:37:44.814
We have no membership.

00:37:44.824 --> 00:37:46.784
This is not an organisation.

00:37:46.814 --> 00:37:48.034
Question: But…

00:37:48.074 --> 00:37:52.454
Shri Mataji: Now, I’m very happy that…Please, sit down, all right?

00:37:52.444 --> 00:37:53.044
I know.

00:37:53.054 --> 00:37:54.054
He is a seeker.

00:37:54.064 --> 00:37:56.494
He has been to many organisations.

00:37:57.034 --> 00:37:58.034
There has to be.

00:37:58.762 --> 00:38:04.484
It is written already in the Bible, there have to be many like these, you see, coming up.

00:38:04.469 --> 00:38:05.364
All right?

00:38:05.649 --> 00:38:18.201
But first of all, I have requested you that here we are not selling anything, to begin with.

00:38:18.314 --> 00:38:20.911
We are not selling.

00:38:21.404 --> 00:38:29.074
What are you going to lose in any case?

00:38:29.074 --> 00:38:35.644
Maybe, your ego a little bit, maybe.

00:38:35.644 --> 00:38:42.863
Because we are identified with our ego, we
think our self is our ego, you see; which

00:38:42.863 --> 00:38:46.234
may not be pampered [here] also, as in another
organisation.

00:38:46.234 --> 00:38:52.364
I have been, seen people who are very honest,
they go to other organisations and they find

00:38:52.364 --> 00:38:59.494
that only their ego is pampered and their
pockets are being vacated.

00:38:59.494 --> 00:39:02.694
No, that’s not here.

00:39:02.694 --> 00:39:08.364
Now, I also do not guarantee that you will
get your Realisation definitely.

00:39:08.364 --> 00:39:09.994
It’s like germination.

00:39:09.994 --> 00:39:15.774
If it works, I’ll be the happiest person
and you’ll be the happiest.

00:39:15.774 --> 00:39:19.714
If it doesn’t work, please come again, we’ll
work out.

00:39:19.714 --> 00:39:27.274
So, again if you have started judging about
it, it won’t work out.

00:39:27.274 --> 00:39:37.474
There are fifty per cent people here who are
realised people and they know your problems.

00:39:37.474 --> 00:39:44.134
They haven’t given me a single pie (1\192
Rupee), nothing!

00:39:44.134 --> 00:39:53.844
But if you come here, you
have come in your own right, because you are

00:39:53.844 --> 00:40:00.492
a seeker and I respect you for that and I
love you for that.

00:40:00.554 --> 00:40:02.312
And I am here for you.

00:40:05.244 --> 00:40:06.692
Not in London.

00:40:06.762 --> 00:40:10.984
I didn’t come to London for that, I came
by chance.

00:40:10.984 --> 00:40:15.414
You know that my husband was appointed here
to this U.N.

00:40:15.414 --> 00:40:19.264
thing, he was elected, and I had to come here.

00:40:19.264 --> 00:40:28.164
But also, this is God’s desire that I should
be with you because there are so many seekers!

00:40:28.164 --> 00:40:31.184
So, I am with you here.

00:40:31.184 --> 00:40:37.384
If you have been to many organisations and
many thugs also, I must tell you very, very

00:40:37.384 --> 00:40:41.634
frankly that you’ll have problems much more
than anybody else will have.

00:40:41.634 --> 00:40:50.364
It’s going to be difficult to give you Realisation,
because all these organisations do spoil your

00:40:50.364 --> 00:40:53.864
Kundalini and your chakras.

00:40:53.864 --> 00:41:00.104
I’ve yet to meet one organisation which
doesn’t spoil.

00:41:00.104 --> 00:41:09.668
Except for, there are some real people who
live in the forests and they have disciples.

00:41:09.744 --> 00:41:16.904
But I can make them out: if they are coming
from the real gurus, I immediately know.

00:41:16.964 --> 00:41:25.194
But no organisation, so far, I have known,
who has even kept your instrument intact.

00:41:26.714 --> 00:41:33.643
They have spoilt your Agnya, they have spoilt
other centres, which are so vital, just to

00:41:33.663 --> 00:41:36.074
get some money out of you.

00:41:36.074 --> 00:41:42.234
I don’t know why they have done it.

00:41:42.234 --> 00:41:51.234
I know you are tired of seeking but no more
you should repent about it.

00:41:51.234 --> 00:41:57.866
But if you have been to other gurus, you must
tell us, because we’ll have problems correcting you.

00:41:58.076 --> 00:42:08.664
Even if you read the books, even if you just
think of them or even if you have a photograph,

00:42:08.664 --> 00:42:13.014
it acts negatively; it’s a problem.

00:42:13.014 --> 00:42:22.414
So, I request you to let us know if you have
been to any guru.

00:42:22.414 --> 00:42:30.154
I wish I could tell you the experiences we
have had from people who went to other gurus,

00:42:30.154 --> 00:42:33.084
and the things that we had to correct.

00:42:33.084 --> 00:42:41.237
And most of the Sahaj Yogis are here who have
been, at least half of them or most of them

00:42:41.277 --> 00:42:46.344
have been to some gurus somewhere and have
known this, that there is a problem.

00:42:46.344 --> 00:42:48.444
Doesn’t matter!

00:42:48.444 --> 00:43:01.044
If your Kundalini is preserved even by them,
I’ll be very thankful.

00:43:01.044 --> 00:43:03.144
All right?

00:43:03.144 --> 00:43:06.294
It’s correct now?

00:43:06.294 --> 00:43:08.394
What’s it?

00:43:09.728 --> 00:43:12.618
So, should we start now?

00:43:12.676 --> 00:43:16.156
Let us see how it works out, hmm?

00:43:16.156 --> 00:43:17.156
Hmm.

00:43:17.146 --> 00:43:20.566
Now, put your hands like this.

00:43:32.546 --> 00:43:38.911
One has to be extremely positive, after Realisation, about it.

00:43:39.406 --> 00:43:42.806
If you go down you will move very slow.

00:43:42.967 --> 00:43:47.706
It is like three paces forward and two paces
backwards.

00:43:47.736 --> 00:43:49.396
When you will reach?

00:43:49.416 --> 00:43:51.676
You’ll never reach!

00:43:53.086 --> 00:43:58.016
Before that, I do not ask for anything.

00:43:58.016 --> 00:44:01.866
But after that you have to do it.

00:44:01.866 --> 00:44:09.026
Secondly, when you put your hands towards
me, as shown there, all these fingers have

00:44:09.026 --> 00:44:22.726
got the centres, the chakras, dormantly placed on these fingers: one, two, three, four, five,

00:44:22.836 --> 00:44:31.126
six and seven, on the left, on the right;
left sympathetic and right sympathetic.

00:44:31.116 --> 00:44:33.886
So, when you are placing towards me, 

00:44:33.986 --> 00:44:37.406
like as you place towards this one, it radiates heat.

00:44:37.546 --> 00:44:40.386
In the same way, I radiate this Divine love.

00:44:40.386 --> 00:44:45.756
You will also radiate when you will be realised,
when you will be enlightened.

00:44:45.756 --> 00:44:51.586
So, when you put your hands towards me you
take this radiation within yourself.

00:44:51.586 --> 00:44:56.166
It goes within yourself onto these.

00:44:56.166 --> 00:45:09.126
There are two very important chakras, which
work it down on your, these, two lines and

00:45:09.126 --> 00:45:16.386
inform the Kundalini through the lower chakra to rise.

00:45:17.946 --> 00:45:22.294
And you can see with your naked eyes the pulsation of Kundalini 

00:45:22.264 --> 00:45:24.694
in some people, who’s this chakra is catching.

00:45:24.698 --> 00:45:26.024
With naked eyes you can see.

00:45:26.014 --> 00:45:29.054
You can see even the rising of the Kundalini.

00:45:29.364 --> 00:45:33.848
If you have the stethoscope you can feel the throbbing going up.

00:45:33.914 --> 00:45:40.384
When it reaches here, it throbs here and then it stops.

00:45:41.014 --> 00:45:43.304
That is the time you are realised.

00:45:43.434 --> 00:45:46.394
But some people have lots of imbalances.

00:45:48.415 --> 00:45:50.713
Now, how do we remove them?

00:45:54.782 --> 00:45:59.434
Supposing the ego is too much on this side, there is no space here.

00:45:59.554 --> 00:46:02.254
So, you have to push down the ego.

00:46:02.254 --> 00:46:06.124
If the superego is too much, you have to push
down the superego.

00:46:06.124 --> 00:46:18.074
So, those who are realised people, also radiate
this, this Divine love, this integrated force

00:46:18.074 --> 00:46:26.334
of vital energies and they, through their
vibrations, manoeuvre it by giving these radiations,

00:46:26.334 --> 00:46:29.370
they take it down.

00:46:29.380 --> 00:46:32.720
You can also do it.

00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.941
You have to learn, only, the art.

00:46:35.051 --> 00:46:38.561
And then they raise the Kundalini, so the
Kundalini starts.

00:46:38.561 --> 00:46:42.571
If there is an obstruction you can see the
Kundalini going there.

00:46:42.571 --> 00:46:45.519
For example: somebody has a liver trouble;

00:46:45.651 --> 00:46:49.901
you can see the Kundalini going there and throbbing.

00:46:50.494 --> 00:46:57.194
If you have the kidneys trouble, the Kundalini
will go there; poor thing will supply to the

00:46:57.194 --> 00:46:59.011
kidneys and then come up.

00:46:59.071 --> 00:47:06.281
That’s why the first thing that will happen
to you is, that physically you will be cured.

00:47:06.281 --> 00:47:09.741
We have definitely cured cancer.

00:47:09.741 --> 00:47:13.551
The president of India (Neelam Sanjiva Reddy)
who was suffering from cancer, was cured by

00:47:13.551 --> 00:47:14.551
me.

00:47:14.551 --> 00:47:18.011
If you want you can write to him and ask.

00:47:18.011 --> 00:47:23.821
That cancer can only be cured by Sahaj Yoga,
by nothing else, is also another fact.

00:47:23.821 --> 00:47:27.091
But doesn’t matter; don’t get too frightened
about it.

00:47:27.091 --> 00:47:35.271
Just now, let us have the Kundalini moving.

00:47:35.271 --> 00:47:38.441
Let us see if it starts.

00:47:38.441 --> 00:47:39.781
It has to start.

00:47:39.781 --> 00:47:43.501
By anything you cannot do it.

00:47:43.501 --> 00:47:48.781
Only through Divine radiation you can do it.

00:47:57.121 --> 00:48:06.001
But (break in recording) I have seen horrible
Kundalinis, I have seen, in doing this work.

00:48:06.151 --> 00:48:12.253
People are not aware of it: what we have done to harm ourselves, people are not aware and

00:48:12.262 --> 00:48:17.892
that’s why sometimes it takes time, doesn’t matter.

00:48:18.042 --> 00:48:24.202
As I have patience and love for you, please
have patience for yourself because you are

00:48:24.232 --> 00:48:26.855
a seeker.

00:48:26.942 --> 00:48:34.937
You are a seeker of truth and that’s why
I’m here.

00:48:35.207 --> 00:48:41.087
Now please put your hands like this close
your eyes.

00:48:41.157 --> 00:48:44.177
And you have to put your feet on the ground.

00:48:44.267 --> 00:48:52.917
The reason is that the Mother Earth sucks
in lots of our problems.

00:48:53.497 --> 00:48:59.472
Now the people who are realised also can help
me, they are just like my hands.

00:48:59.517 --> 00:49:02.092
You have to also become my hands.

00:49:02.097 --> 00:49:06.022
But when they move their hands and all that
you are not to get frightened of them.

00:49:06.047 --> 00:49:08.985
They are the people who are salvaging you!

00:49:09.157 --> 00:49:11.437
They have to help you.

00:49:11.437 --> 00:49:17.187
If they know swimming, they have to fetch
you to the shores.

00:49:17.187 --> 00:49:19.777
They have to extend their hands to you.

00:49:19.777 --> 00:49:21.697
Don’t be frightened of them.

00:49:21.697 --> 00:49:25.677
Come on the shores and you are going to do
the same thing.

00:49:25.677 --> 00:49:27.787
There’s nothing to be frightened.

00:49:27.787 --> 00:49:29.637
They are not going to do anything.

00:49:29.637 --> 00:49:33.107
Might be, they might feel, if you are realised
or not.

00:49:33.107 --> 00:49:39.577
So, just put your hands like this.

00:49:39.577 --> 00:49:44.097
Now, you have to close your eyes.

00:49:44.097 --> 00:49:48.337
Close your eyes, please.

00:49:48.337 --> 00:49:53.647
But some cannot close their eyes because the
eyelids will flicker.

00:49:53.647 --> 00:49:58.007
So, please open your eyes, in that case.

00:49:58.007 --> 00:50:04.087
If your eyes can be easily closed without
any flickering, then keep them closed.

00:50:04.087 --> 00:50:07.777
That’s a very good sign.

00:50:07.777 --> 00:50:18.649
Now, if you feel anything like little shaking
in the hands or anything like that, then open

00:50:18.677 --> 00:50:20.369
your eyes.

00:50:20.357 --> 00:50:22.559
Nothing external should happen.

00:50:22.537 --> 00:50:24.617
If it happens, then open your eyes.

00:50:24.617 --> 00:50:32.687
Even if you feel heat in the hand, you’ll
not feel much, but if you feel slightly even,

00:50:32.687 --> 00:50:41.857
which you think is little unbearable then
open your eyes.

00:50:41.857 --> 00:50:46.597
When you close your eyes most of you will
find you have no thoughts in your mind already.

00:50:46.597 --> 00:50:52.887
This is called as Nirvichar Samadhi, is called
as thoughtless awareness.

00:50:52.887 --> 00:51:01.457
It’s this samadhi, it’s this state which
is achieved after thousands of years of meditation,

00:51:01.457 --> 00:51:03.307
as they say.

00:51:03.307 --> 00:51:06.197
It’s the most difficult thing, agreed.

00:51:06.197 --> 00:51:11.177
But there could be someone for whom this could be only just a play.
