00:01:57.717 --> 00:02:01.258
Today we have assembled here

00:02:01.717 --> 00:02:06.467
to worship Sadashiva,

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:13.050
which is reflected within us as Shiva, as the spirit.

00:02:17.258 --> 00:02:20.383
He is reflected in our heart,

00:02:22.383 --> 00:02:28.133
and as you have seen

00:02:29.592 --> 00:02:35.883
that the goal of our life

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:43.509
was to achieve this state of spirit.

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:52.300
The other day I was reading some books

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:59.133
how it was done,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.841
this Self-realization, to know the spirit,

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.300
and how people were tortured.

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:20.217
First of all they're asked to

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:28.383
somehow or other deny, defy and condemn their body.

00:03:30.925 --> 00:03:35.550
Now, if the body wants to have comfort,

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:45.342
then it was said that first try to sleep on the carpet,

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:48.509
not on the bed.

00:03:49.634 --> 00:03:53.425
Then still, it's not enough;

00:03:53.925 --> 00:03:56.925
then from the carpet you go to a mat

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:00.091
still is not enough.

00:04:00.425 --> 00:04:03.759
Then from that maybe,

00:04:05.175 --> 00:04:07.841
you move down

00:04:08.883 --> 00:04:12.717
to the Mother Earth,

00:04:13.008 --> 00:04:15.133
sleep on the Mother Earth.

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:19.841
Still if the body is not all right

00:04:20.091 --> 00:04:24.425
then you start sleeping on the stone.

00:04:24.966 --> 00:04:28.675
But still the Himalayas are far away,

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:31.883
because Shiva resides in Kailasha.

00:04:32.217 --> 00:04:36.883
So you go to Himalayas and sleep on the ice.

00:04:37.217 --> 00:04:41.717
This was the minimum requirement.

00:04:43.008 --> 00:04:50.425
Then it was said that you are fond of good food,

00:04:52.675 --> 00:04:55.091
you want to have sumptuous food,

00:04:55.425 --> 00:04:58.342
you eat a lot, all right;

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:02.467
so you deny everything that you like, to begin with,

00:05:02.799 --> 00:05:04.592
all that you like.

00:05:05.008 --> 00:05:08.258
For example, Italians cannot eat pasta!

00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:18.467
Then deny that.

00:05:20.091 --> 00:05:22.634
But that's not sufficient.

00:05:23.091 --> 00:05:26.342
After that you start eating things

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:29.091
which are very bitter.

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:32.841
As in the Zen system they give you to eat

00:05:33.175 --> 00:05:36.883
something which is like quinine raised to power 108,

00:05:37.217 --> 00:05:42.008
absolutely bitter - or absolutely sweet.

00:05:42.342 --> 00:05:45.759
So put your tongue into test.

00:05:47.217 --> 00:05:50.050
But still the stomach is there.

00:05:50.342 --> 00:05:53.050
So if you are eating too much,

00:05:53.342 --> 00:05:56.966
you fast for one day. That's not sufficient.

00:05:57.342 --> 00:05:59.300
Then fast for seven days.

00:05:59.634 --> 00:06:01.425
Then for forty days.

00:06:01.799 --> 00:06:06.175
I mean, a month has got only thirty days;

00:06:06.467 --> 00:06:09.425
to fast for forty days means you are already finished.

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.634
That's how if you have to do your penance for nirvana.

00:06:14.883 --> 00:06:16.342
As it is you get a nirvana

00:06:16.675 --> 00:06:18.841
because you're finished and dead, you see,

00:06:19.217 --> 00:06:23.634
nothing is left out of you, nothing but bones,

00:06:23.883 --> 00:06:27.799
and these bones then become nirvana.

00:06:28.258 --> 00:06:30.133
Ultimately the death follows,

00:06:30.467 --> 00:06:31.883
so you are finished and there is nirvana,

00:06:32.133 --> 00:06:34.467
no doubt about it.

00:06:36.634 --> 00:06:38.759
Then you don't live in a house,

00:06:39.091 --> 00:06:40.841
because house is comfort.

00:06:41.175 --> 00:06:44.550
Give up your wife, give up your children, give up everyone.

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.966
Now wear only one something,

00:06:51.217 --> 00:06:53.675
like a cloth tied round,

00:06:57.091 --> 00:07:03.717
and go and ask for alms from people.

00:07:09.883 --> 00:07:13.717
With these clothes also there's still problem,

00:07:14.008 --> 00:07:16.467
because you're attached to your cloth.

00:07:16.883 --> 00:07:20.091
So you go to Himalayas where there's nobody to see you,

00:07:20.467 --> 00:07:21.592
take out your clothes

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:26.008
and in that cold you stay there, completely shaking.

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:28.133
Then you'll get your nirvana.

00:07:28.467 --> 00:07:31.300
As it is you get nirvana.

00:07:34.467 --> 00:07:37.675
All such conditions were put

00:07:40.841 --> 00:07:46.217
as to destroy the demands of your body to begin with.

00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.217
You tell your body, "No, nothing doing.

00:07:50.634 --> 00:07:55.467
You better work out your nirvana."

00:07:56.634 --> 00:08:01.550
The second thing was to destroy your mind

00:08:03.841 --> 00:08:06.883
which takes you to senses,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:10.342
to things of joy.

00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:15.008
Supposing you want to have some,

00:08:18.675 --> 00:08:20.966
something very much,

00:08:21.425 --> 00:08:25.550
so deny that, deny that.

00:08:26.175 --> 00:08:28.091
Anything that your mind tells you,

00:08:28.425 --> 00:08:31.175
just say "No, no, no" to it.

00:08:31.841 --> 00:08:34.425
In Sanskrit

00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:38.509
the shloka is like this,

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.217
"Yat neti neti vachane, nigamo vacha"

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:42.592
- which you go on saying,

00:08:42.883 --> 00:08:46.800
"neti, neti": "No, not this, not this, not this, not this."

00:08:47.425 --> 00:08:50.342
And then you can discuss about

00:08:50.675 --> 00:08:53.509
- discuss only, yes - nirvana.

00:08:53.925 --> 00:08:59.300
Before that you are not even worthy of discussion of nirvana.

00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:02.925
When I read this book I said,

00:09:03.175 --> 00:09:06.509
"Baba, I give up. It's too much."

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.717
But in Sahaja Yoga

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.841
is the other way round,

00:09:17.133 --> 00:09:19.966
like building first the pinnacle of the building,

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:22.966
and then the foundation.

00:09:23.841 --> 00:09:28.175
Opening your Sahasrara was the first thing was achieved.

00:09:28.925 --> 00:09:32.050
And then in the light of Sahasrara

00:09:32.634 --> 00:09:35.800
you have to watch yourself and see for yourself.

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:41.759
Gradually the introspection was a better thing,

00:09:42.841 --> 00:09:45.509
through vibrations

00:09:46.841 --> 00:09:50.175
is to see why:

00:09:50.425 --> 00:09:52.634
why I want this?

00:09:52.966 --> 00:09:55.925
Why my attention goes to my comfort?

00:09:56.425 --> 00:09:58.799
Why my attention goes to food,

00:09:59.175 --> 00:10:02.300
why to my family, why to my children,

00:10:02.675 --> 00:10:05.925
when I have to achieve the highest?

00:10:06.425 --> 00:10:09.175
So you start introspecting yourself.

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:12.759
Then you know on your vibrations also

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:15.759
there's something wrong with you.

00:10:16.509 --> 00:10:19.425
Then you don't try to see others,

00:10:19.675 --> 00:10:22.799
what's wrong with others, you start seeing yourself;

00:10:23.091 --> 00:10:28.799
because it's your own ascent

00:10:29.509 --> 00:10:32.175
you have to achieve.

00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:37.841
But in the olden times,

00:10:38.841 --> 00:10:43.841
all these things were done individually.

00:10:45.091 --> 00:10:48.342
Like a one person who starts

00:10:48.841 --> 00:10:51.883
the path of nirvana,

00:10:55.759 --> 00:11:00.800
he used to go into ekant, means into lonely places,

00:11:01.383 --> 00:11:03.550
stay away from people, avoid them,

00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:05.300
have nothing to do,

00:11:05.634 --> 00:11:09.550
and achieve this ascent,

00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:13.841
Self-realization, only for himself.

00:11:16.050 --> 00:11:18.634
It was not for others.

00:11:19.175 --> 00:11:22.841
Then this gentleman became absolutely exclusive.

00:11:23.425 --> 00:11:24.841
He wouldn't talk to anyone,

00:11:25.091 --> 00:11:27.175
he wouldn't meet anybody

00:11:27.675 --> 00:11:29.008
and he would sit somewhere

00:11:29.383 --> 00:11:33.883
on top of a remote mountain.

00:11:35.717 --> 00:11:37.717
Anybody who tried to meet him

00:11:37.925 --> 00:11:41.217
he would throw stones or say all kinds of horrible things,

00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:44.217
and never meet that person.

00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:52.258
But Sahaja Yoga is not the same thing.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:56.883
Sahaja Yoga is the ascent of the whole.

00:12:00.217 --> 00:12:03.133
This kind of singular achievements

00:12:03.467 --> 00:12:06.133
did not lead people anywhere.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:11.008
Saints of course tried to talk to people,

00:12:11.383 --> 00:12:13.800
tell them about Self-realization, about God,

00:12:14.217 --> 00:12:18.008
about righteousness, about value system;

00:12:18.592 --> 00:12:23.550
but they too were regarded as something strange,

00:12:24.383 --> 00:12:27.717
and were tortured and troubled.

00:12:29.925 --> 00:12:35.675
So on the level of an individual ascent,

00:12:36.258 --> 00:12:38.383
they couldn't do anything for others

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:41.467
except for talking about it, telling about it,

00:12:41.799 --> 00:12:46.133
till Sahaja Yoga came.

00:12:46.717 --> 00:12:50.467
Even the talking about it was prohibited.

00:12:51.883 --> 00:12:56.133
Till the twelfth century in India

00:12:56.550 --> 00:13:00.008
nobody talked about it to the public.

00:13:01.675 --> 00:13:03.467
It was all in Sanskrit,

00:13:03.799 --> 00:13:06.592
very difficult Sanskrit books

00:13:07.008 --> 00:13:09.883
which were only available to few aspirants.

00:13:10.258 --> 00:13:13.217
Was explained to very, very few even,

00:13:13.925 --> 00:13:18.342
amounting to few numbers of people.

00:13:20.675 --> 00:13:25.592
But giving realization was denied.

00:13:26.883 --> 00:13:30.675
So only one master had one disciple,

00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:34.258
and all was the individual ascent,

00:13:34.592 --> 00:13:36.383
individual working out.

00:13:36.717 --> 00:13:39.008
Such a disciple was taken away from others

00:13:39.342 --> 00:13:41.550
and was kept in secret,

00:13:41.925 --> 00:13:43.841
worked it out on him;

00:13:43.966 --> 00:13:48.592
and just he may sing, he may write poems,

00:13:48.883 --> 00:13:51.592
he may talk about it, he might say what his joy is,

00:13:51.966 --> 00:13:55.799
but he had no right to give realization to anyone,

00:13:56.133 --> 00:13:58.841
neither he knew how to give realization.

00:14:01.008 --> 00:14:04.133
So now you see how far you have gone.

00:14:04.675 --> 00:14:07.133
You've got your realization

00:14:07.675 --> 00:14:10.342
without giving up much.

00:14:12.133 --> 00:14:15.592
You can work on a much wider scale,

00:14:16.091 --> 00:14:18.467
you can give realizations to other.

00:14:18.799 --> 00:14:22.342
You know about all the subtle knowledge

00:14:22.675 --> 00:14:26.550
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:29.091 --> 00:14:31.217
But today I'm going to tell you something more

00:14:31.634 --> 00:14:33.925
which we have to know.

00:14:35.841 --> 00:14:38.342
It's very important to know,

00:14:38.799 --> 00:14:43.509
because as was described by people

00:14:44.799 --> 00:14:49.509
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

00:14:51.050 --> 00:14:54.634
but it's not from their heart.

00:14:57.550 --> 00:15:00.759
And heart is the abode of the spirit

00:15:03.091 --> 00:15:06.925
- is the Shiva within us.

00:15:08.675 --> 00:15:11.550
So we have to know more about heart,

00:15:12.175 --> 00:15:15.925
and that is very important.

00:15:17.383 --> 00:15:20.258
You know about these three nadis we have:

00:15:20.717 --> 00:15:22.509
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

00:15:23.467 --> 00:15:26.592
but in the heart there are four nadis.

00:15:30.425 --> 00:15:34.759
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

00:15:37.966 --> 00:15:42.008
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

00:15:42.342 --> 00:15:46.675
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

00:15:47.133 --> 00:15:50.841
Actually you ask for your destruction.

00:15:52.841 --> 00:15:57.799
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

00:16:02.467 --> 00:16:06.342
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

00:16:06.966 --> 00:16:11.091
it's like when a fruit has to come,

00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:15.091
the petals look as if they're destroyed

00:16:15.425 --> 00:16:18.091
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

00:16:18.509 --> 00:16:21.050
you can call it like your conditionings,

00:16:21.342 --> 00:16:23.634
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:27.091
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:30.175
This has to be destroyed

00:16:30.675 --> 00:16:33.799
for the beauty to come out.

00:16:34.966 --> 00:16:41.091
So when your maryadas

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:46.175
you cross beyond certain point,

00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:50.258
you go to your destruction.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:57.091
In four directions there are destructions built,

00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.425
as there are four nadis.

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:04.717
So now, what is to be done?

00:17:05.759 --> 00:17:09.759
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

00:17:10.175 --> 00:17:13.509
through the first nadi, going to hell?

00:17:15.050 --> 00:17:19.509
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

00:17:20.425 --> 00:17:23.509
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

00:17:23.841 --> 00:17:26.925
He is innocence personified.

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:33.133
So

00:17:34.883 --> 00:17:41.467
we have to put our carnal desires,

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:45.425
dissolve them,

00:17:47.133 --> 00:17:51.966
dissolve them into the innocence,

00:17:52.342 --> 00:17:55.592
the ocean of innocence.

00:17:58.300 --> 00:18:02.883
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

00:18:05.133 --> 00:18:10.883
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

00:18:11.217 --> 00:18:15.425
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

00:18:15.841 --> 00:18:19.550
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:25.300
you see children, they're innocent;

00:18:26.091 --> 00:18:28.300
flowers, they're innocent.

00:18:29.675 --> 00:18:33.592
Divert your attention

00:18:35.675 --> 00:18:38.425
to all these things.

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:46.258
You see, on walking on the street,

00:18:46.841 --> 00:18:49.759
what is there to see best

00:18:50.091 --> 00:18:53.841
is all at three feet height.

00:18:55.300 --> 00:18:58.759
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

00:18:59.091 --> 00:19:01.091
all the beautiful grass,

00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:05.799
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

00:19:06.799 --> 00:19:10.425
You need not see people who are above that.

00:19:13.342 --> 00:19:17.050
Just see on three feet level.

00:19:20.550 --> 00:19:25.550
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

00:19:27.217 --> 00:19:30.425
But you don't see the eyes of a person

00:19:30.799 --> 00:19:33.675
who are not innocent.

00:19:34.592 --> 00:19:38.133
So dissolve this desire

00:19:39.717 --> 00:19:42.300
into innocence.

00:19:43.717 --> 00:19:46.925
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.509
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

00:19:53.841 --> 00:19:55.966
it is righteous,

00:19:56.383 --> 00:19:59.050
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

00:20:01.258 --> 00:20:03.383
it's pure.

00:20:03.759 --> 00:20:05.925
So even if you are in this world,

00:20:06.175 --> 00:20:08.592
even if you are living like a human being,

00:20:08.966 --> 00:20:11.383
even if you have children,

00:20:12.175 --> 00:20:15.258
still you are innocent.

00:20:17.175 --> 00:20:22.383
Like once the wives of Shri Krishna

00:20:22.759 --> 00:20:25.717
- He had sixteen thousand wives to begin with,

00:20:26.050 --> 00:20:28.008
and the five more.

00:20:28.425 --> 00:20:30.133
The sixteen thousand were His powers,

00:20:30.467 --> 00:20:33.300
and five were the elements.

00:20:36.008 --> 00:20:41.759
They were wanting to go to pray to some big well-known,

00:20:43.799 --> 00:20:48.300
I should say, saint had come, a maharshi had come.

00:20:48.675 --> 00:20:52.217
So they wanted to go and see him and pay respects.

00:20:52.841 --> 00:20:56.217
So they asked Shri Krishna's permission,

00:20:56.592 --> 00:21:00.799
but when they went they found the river was all in spate,

00:21:01.550 --> 00:21:05.300
so flooded they could not cross over.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.634
They came back, they said,

00:21:07.925 --> 00:21:12.883
"How can we cross over this river? It's all in spate."

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.133
So this Krishna said,

00:21:15.467 --> 00:21:17.258
"All right, you just go and say,

00:21:17.799 --> 00:21:22.008
РІР‚В˜If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara,

00:21:22.759 --> 00:21:27.841
and if He is absolutely innocent about sex,

00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:31.592
you go down.'"

00:21:34.717 --> 00:21:36.425
They said, "How can we? We are so many wives.

00:21:36.759 --> 00:21:39.008
What is He talking about?"

00:21:40.467 --> 00:21:43.175
So they went down and said this to the river,

00:21:43.634 --> 00:21:46.300
and the river went down, and they were surprised that

00:21:46.717 --> 00:21:50.925
"this husband of ours is saying all these things."

00:21:54.883 --> 00:21:59.759
They went across and worshipped that rishi

00:22:00.799 --> 00:22:04.759
and they were coming back, again the river was in floods.

00:22:06.717 --> 00:22:08.467
So they went back to the rishi, said,

00:22:08.759 --> 00:22:11.175
"Now how are we to cross over because it's in floods?"

00:22:11.634 --> 00:22:12.759
He said, "How did you come?"

00:22:13.008 --> 00:22:15.925
So they told the story of Shri Krishna.

00:22:16.592 --> 00:22:19.467
Now they had fed this rishi with food and fruits

00:22:19.799 --> 00:22:22.592
and he had eaten such a lot.

00:22:23.008 --> 00:22:26.383
"All right, you go and tell this river that

00:22:26.717 --> 00:22:29.799
this rishi has not eaten at all anything."

00:22:30.217 --> 00:22:32.342
They said, "How can it be? Just now you ate before us."

00:22:32.759 --> 00:22:34.217
He said, "Just go and see."

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:40.175
They went back and told this to the river.

00:22:42.091 --> 00:22:45.300
The river again went down.

00:22:48.008 --> 00:22:50.550
So to live in this world,

00:22:51.175 --> 00:22:53.550
to be a wife or to be a husband,

00:22:53.883 --> 00:22:59.008
to be married, whatever it is,

00:23:00.841 --> 00:23:03.634
you can be innocent,

00:23:04.217 --> 00:23:07.467
absolutely innocent about it.

00:23:08.008 --> 00:23:11.175
That's the sign of your purity.

00:23:14.467 --> 00:23:19.467
The second nadi, the second channel

00:23:19.883 --> 00:23:23.342
that can take you to destruction is desire.

00:23:24.425 --> 00:23:26.966
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

00:23:27.467 --> 00:23:31.091
is the only way that people do not get old,

00:23:31.467 --> 00:23:33.799
nor sick,

00:23:34.841 --> 00:23:37.675
nor worried.

00:23:41.425 --> 00:23:44.966
Now this desire that we have,

00:23:45.966 --> 00:23:47.759
"I want this,"

00:23:47.966 --> 00:23:51.300
in the West is much more than anywhere else

00:23:51.675 --> 00:23:53.799
because the entrepreneurs are every day

00:23:54.091 --> 00:23:56.342
producing new things.

00:23:56.759 --> 00:24:00.425
Say for example a hairdress,

00:24:00.799 --> 00:24:03.342
so the women want to buy this wig or that wig,

00:24:03.634 --> 00:24:06.841
"It's my desire, I must have this wig to put on my head."

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.217
The another one says, "All right, I must have this one."

00:24:13.217 --> 00:24:19.300
And the desire, for men, is "Oh, if he is having

00:24:19.675 --> 00:24:23.175
a Rolls Royce, why shouldn't I have one?"

00:24:25.966 --> 00:24:29.425
They cannot enjoy somebody else's Rolls Royce.

00:24:31.342 --> 00:24:36.509
It should be your own, that "I should have the possession."

00:24:38.091 --> 00:24:42.425
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

00:24:42.883 --> 00:24:48.008
The desires could be also

00:24:48.467 --> 00:24:50.675
quite mental,

00:24:52.717 --> 00:24:55.550
"I must possess this woman,

00:24:56.008 --> 00:24:58.883
I must possess this child."

00:24:59.550 --> 00:25:04.217
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

00:25:05.467 --> 00:25:09.008
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

00:25:11.008 --> 00:25:15.467
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

00:25:21.966 --> 00:25:28.675
Go on adding up things, getting things

00:25:32.342 --> 00:25:36.467
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

00:25:38.717 --> 00:25:41.008
What is the reason

00:25:42.342 --> 00:25:46.634
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

00:25:47.509 --> 00:25:50.133
It's an impure desire.

00:25:50.800 --> 00:25:52.342
It's an impure desire,

00:25:52.592 --> 00:25:54.800
and when such a desire starts working

00:25:55.133 --> 00:25:57.133
you can go any far,

00:25:57.509 --> 00:25:59.925
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler,

00:26:00.175 --> 00:26:01.759
like anything is nothing

00:26:02.050 --> 00:26:06.592
but absolutely desire beyond

00:26:08.634 --> 00:26:11.509
any limitations.

00:26:12.383 --> 00:26:15.008
You want to dominate others

00:26:16.759 --> 00:26:19.383
is also another desire.

00:26:21.925 --> 00:26:24.050
All these desires

00:26:25.175 --> 00:26:28.925
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

00:26:31.133 --> 00:26:33.342
because there's no joy,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:35.883
there's no happiness.

00:26:37.925 --> 00:26:44.050
For example, now I want to have a sari,

00:26:47.509 --> 00:26:50.175
so I want to buy a sari.

00:26:51.509 --> 00:26:54.050
All my attention will be how will I get that sari,

00:26:54.383 --> 00:26:56.509
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing.

00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:01.592
The attention becomes polluted,

00:27:02.050 --> 00:27:06.175
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

00:27:06.592 --> 00:27:10.592
The attention which has to enjoy,

00:27:11.925 --> 00:27:15.258
which has to enjoy the spirit,

00:27:16.883 --> 00:27:19.467
which has to nourish the spirit,

00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:25.759
becomes disturbed because of desires.

00:27:27.634 --> 00:27:30.800
In the first place the attention

00:27:31.133 --> 00:27:35.008
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

00:27:36.258 --> 00:27:40.133
In the second place the attention

00:27:41.050 --> 00:27:45.342
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

00:27:50.175 --> 00:27:55.383
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

00:27:59.342 --> 00:28:02.133
The desire for beautiful things

00:28:04.258 --> 00:28:08.175
- we can shift our desire,

00:28:09.008 --> 00:28:11.800
material desire into aesthetics,

00:28:12.258 --> 00:28:16.759
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

00:28:18.592 --> 00:28:21.467
because that's the quality of Shiva,

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:25.467
that He gives aesthetics to everything.

00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.050
Now supposing this looks very plain,

00:28:28.342 --> 00:28:31.717
simple and one may say that mechanical.

00:28:32.258 --> 00:28:34.467
But if it was Shiva's job

00:28:34.759 --> 00:28:38.050
He would have done something beautiful about it.

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:44.467
So the quality of Shiva is that He beautifies everything

00:28:45.133 --> 00:28:48.717
that is created by Brahmadeva,

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:52.717
evolved by Vishnu.

00:28:53.300 --> 00:28:56.342
He's the one who does

00:28:56.675 --> 00:28:59.717
the subtle work of creating aesthetics.

00:29:00.175 --> 00:29:02.217
You've seen My photographs many a times

00:29:02.550 --> 00:29:06.759
with so many lights, this, that - is all His job.

00:29:07.091 --> 00:29:08.467
He's doing it.

00:29:08.799 --> 00:29:11.467
He throws lights in such a manner,

00:29:12.050 --> 00:29:14.342
He works out in such a manner.

00:29:14.759 --> 00:29:17.509
Just He wants to convince you about Me.

00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:19.342
It's His job.

00:29:19.634 --> 00:29:23.342
So His job is to create aesthetics:

00:29:25.217 --> 00:29:27.841
aesthetics of behavior,

00:29:28.717 --> 00:29:32.717
aesthetics of poetry.

00:29:35.550 --> 00:29:39.966
Everything that is created is made beautiful,

00:29:40.799 --> 00:29:45.217
is joy-giving, by Shiva - that's His quality.

00:29:48.133 --> 00:29:49.966
So whatever you desire,

00:29:50.258 --> 00:29:53.675
if you start working it out,

00:29:56.008 --> 00:30:02.008
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

00:30:06.425 --> 00:30:08.592
gradually you'll find

00:30:08.966 --> 00:30:11.342
you'll end up with vibrations,

00:30:11.841 --> 00:30:15.300
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

00:30:17.592 --> 00:30:19.133
And to have the vibrations

00:30:19.467 --> 00:30:22.592
you'll have to go to pure desire.

00:30:24.217 --> 00:30:27.008
So this desire which is madness,

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:29.675
which makes you mad,

00:30:30.091 --> 00:30:35.675
which is so much dull and boring

00:30:37.091 --> 00:30:41.550
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

00:30:41.925 --> 00:30:44.091
all your desires into vibration.

00:30:44.342 --> 00:30:48.300
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

00:30:50.509 --> 00:30:53.509
You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations.

00:30:53.966 --> 00:30:57.091
You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations.

00:30:57.841 --> 00:31:01.425
If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.

00:31:07.675 --> 00:31:10.717
I've seen people running away

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:12.800
from some people

00:31:13.091 --> 00:31:17.258
as if some monkey is after them.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:18.675
When I look around,

00:31:18.966 --> 00:31:20.550
I find there are people who are drunkard,

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.050
or somebody coming or something.

00:31:23.509 --> 00:31:26.675
They might have been drunkard themselves once upon a time,

00:31:27.175 --> 00:31:28.383
but now they run away,

00:31:28.717 --> 00:31:32.759
"No, no, no, no. Not so now. Now no, no more."

00:31:34.841 --> 00:31:37.258
We had three, four hippies to begin

00:31:37.634 --> 00:31:39.717
with who came with Me to India.

00:31:39.966 --> 00:31:41.841
They're normal like you, they were become,

00:31:42.175 --> 00:31:43.799
you see, Sahaja yogis.

00:31:44.091 --> 00:31:48.008
And four, five hippies came to My program,

00:31:48.342 --> 00:31:50.300
it was in Rahuri, I think.

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:54.966
They got a fright of their life, "Oh no, oh, God!"

00:31:55.217 --> 00:31:56.675
I said, "What's the matter with you?

00:31:56.883 --> 00:31:58.592
Why are you so frightened?"

00:31:58.883 --> 00:32:00.841
So I turned round to see these hippies,

00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:04.091
and by the time I'd turned round they were out.

00:32:05.217 --> 00:32:07.717
They were no more there.

00:32:09.550 --> 00:32:14.425
So then what happens, all desire ends up into chaitanya,

00:32:15.008 --> 00:32:17.133
into vibrations.

00:32:17.425 --> 00:32:18.509
And if it does not,

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.966
then you must know there's something still missing.

00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.258
But if you do not do this,

00:32:25.425 --> 00:32:28.759
then you end up into your destruction.

00:32:29.966 --> 00:32:33.592
So to say that He's a destroyer

00:32:33.925 --> 00:32:38.300
is a very one-sided statement.

00:32:40.509 --> 00:32:42.800
He has both the powers.

00:32:43.258 --> 00:32:47.008
He has the power to give you vibrations.

00:32:47.759 --> 00:32:50.592
He gives you vibrations.

00:32:54.800 --> 00:32:58.925
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:01.717
but He makes the vibrations.

00:33:01.925 --> 00:33:04.841
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:09.841
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

00:33:13.258 --> 00:33:15.717
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

00:33:15.966 --> 00:33:19.800
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

00:33:20.175 --> 00:33:24.759
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

00:33:26.050 --> 00:33:29.800
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

00:33:31.925 --> 00:33:34.592
Today only I was explaining

00:33:34.925 --> 00:33:38.050
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

00:33:38.592 --> 00:33:41.217
and has done so much study of bhakti

00:33:41.550 --> 00:33:43.550
and all that and knew so much,

00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:48.008
just merged into Me.

00:33:48.050 --> 00:33:50.925
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

00:33:51.425 --> 00:33:53.050
because normally people don't do.

00:33:53.300 --> 00:33:55.175
When they are reading about Devi they think,

00:33:55.425 --> 00:33:56.966
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."

00:33:57.217 --> 00:33:59.091
You see, it's separate things.

00:33:59.342 --> 00:34:02.550
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

00:34:04.091 --> 00:34:06.425
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:09.675
It's written that how You are gentle,

00:34:10.050 --> 00:34:12.675
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.759
how She looks after me,

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:17.425
how Her attention is on me."

00:34:17.841 --> 00:34:21.550
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

00:34:21.799 --> 00:34:24.175
every glance is an inspection."

00:34:24.550 --> 00:34:26.425
But "inspection" not a very good word,

00:34:26.759 --> 00:34:30.300
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

00:34:32.925 --> 00:34:35.300
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

00:34:35.634 --> 00:34:39.050
You are all the time - when I listen to music

00:34:39.383 --> 00:34:42.467
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

00:34:42.883 --> 00:34:46.383
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

00:34:46.925 --> 00:34:50.175
All the time I feel Your love."

00:34:52.258 --> 00:34:54.509
That's how the bhakti comes in.

00:34:54.925 --> 00:34:56.258
So if you have vibrations

00:34:56.634 --> 00:35:00.841
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

00:35:02.091 --> 00:35:04.175
No,

00:35:04.509 --> 00:35:08.509
it means the joy of bhakti.

00:35:11.175 --> 00:35:14.759
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:20.091
It's the ocean of love that is God.

00:35:21.091 --> 00:35:22.799
You just get drenched into it.

00:35:23.091 --> 00:35:25.550
There's no words to it.

00:35:29.799 --> 00:35:31.759
And that is what when you feel,

00:35:31.966 --> 00:35:34.342
you must know that

00:35:35.050 --> 00:35:39.050
you have taken the spirit

00:35:40.509 --> 00:35:44.634
as a real connection

00:35:46.050 --> 00:35:49.300
between you and your Mother,

00:35:50.425 --> 00:35:52.966
or your Father.

00:35:54.925 --> 00:36:00.425
There's no differentiation.

00:36:02.841 --> 00:36:06.175
You are one

00:36:06.425 --> 00:36:09.175
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:12.217
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

00:36:12.759 --> 00:36:15.799
You are one in that bhakti.

00:36:16.799 --> 00:36:20.799
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

00:36:24.091 --> 00:36:26.841
because not man-made.

00:36:30.175 --> 00:36:34.799
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

00:36:36.091 --> 00:36:40.091
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

00:36:40.759 --> 00:36:43.425
but is the bhakti.

00:36:44.258 --> 00:36:46.717
That is the joy

00:36:47.342 --> 00:36:49.342
of Shiva's quality,

00:36:49.717 --> 00:36:53.133
the quality of joy that He adds

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:56.675
to our life.

00:36:57.342 --> 00:37:01.550
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

00:37:01.800 --> 00:37:03.883
Same thing the joy,

00:37:04.217 --> 00:37:06.883
that "I'm loved so much by God,

00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:09.342
that God loves me,

00:37:09.675 --> 00:37:12.592
that I have a meaning in life."

00:37:14.091 --> 00:37:19.091
Then the ego drops out first of all,

00:37:20.675 --> 00:37:26.133
and also the conditionings drop out.

00:37:30.091 --> 00:37:33.091
Now the third nadi:

00:37:38.800 --> 00:37:41.800
third nadi

00:37:42.342 --> 00:37:46.258
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

00:37:48.258 --> 00:37:50.258
attached to someone.

00:37:50.592 --> 00:37:54.925
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

00:37:55.509 --> 00:37:57.634
this is my family,

00:37:57.925 --> 00:38:00.175
this is my wife,

00:38:00.883 --> 00:38:04.342
this is my father, this is my mother.

00:38:06.759 --> 00:38:10.383
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

00:38:10.759 --> 00:38:13.883
when they are just the beginners,

00:38:14.467 --> 00:38:18.800
so they talk about their whole family,

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.509
"My father is like this,

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.759
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:30.008
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:35.383
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

00:38:37.383 --> 00:38:40.258
What should I do?

00:38:41.966 --> 00:38:46.217
Like today somebody said that "You see,

00:38:47.550 --> 00:38:49.550
they lost their first child.

00:38:49.925 --> 00:38:52.008
First child they lost,

00:38:52.841 --> 00:38:55.717
because the child was sleeping in another room."

00:38:55.925 --> 00:38:59.759
I said, "Small children should sleep with mother,

00:39:00.008 --> 00:39:01.925
and mother must look after the children."

00:39:02.091 --> 00:39:03.467
It's simple thing - I mean,

00:39:03.799 --> 00:39:06.300
in India no mother would accept such a situation.

00:39:06.467 --> 00:39:08.133
She'll throw away the husband,

00:39:08.467 --> 00:39:11.675
say, "What's this? I have to look after the child."

00:39:12.008 --> 00:39:16.717
So I said, "Tell them that they should sleep with the child."

00:39:18.133 --> 00:39:19.467
But they don't believe in it.

00:39:19.717 --> 00:39:21.883
So all right - what can we do?

00:39:22.133 --> 00:39:25.008
Have we taken their contract that

00:39:25.342 --> 00:39:27.258
we should look after their children,

00:39:27.675 --> 00:39:30.883
even when they don't want to listen to us?

00:39:31.717 --> 00:39:37.799
So the idea is, all the time in the beginning is that

00:39:38.091 --> 00:39:42.091
"Oh Mother, I've been doing Sahaja Yoga for one month,

00:39:42.425 --> 00:39:47.217
but so far my financial condition has not improved."

00:39:48.217 --> 00:39:51.133
As if they're going to sue Me for that,

00:39:52.799 --> 00:39:56.008
as if I've let them down.

00:39:59.008 --> 00:40:00.675
But they don't want to see that

00:40:00.883 --> 00:40:03.091
you have just now come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:40:03.425 --> 00:40:05.717
or even if you have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years,

00:40:05.966 --> 00:40:08.799
you have not been a Sahaja yogi.

00:40:09.217 --> 00:40:11.675
Something missing, you don't deserve.

00:40:11.966 --> 00:40:14.966
Something wrong with you, not with Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:15.425 --> 00:40:18.966
But they feel that Sahaja Yoga

00:40:19.425 --> 00:40:23.550
is something which has got the contract.

00:40:24.050 --> 00:40:25.300
Immediately they'll inform you,

00:40:25.592 --> 00:40:26.634
"Now somebody is sick there,

00:40:26.841 --> 00:40:28.717
somebody's somebody's somebody's somebody.

00:40:29.008 --> 00:40:33.925
Send five Sahaja yogis." For what?

00:40:37.050 --> 00:40:41.050
These attachments start working within us.

00:40:41.883 --> 00:40:44.550
Now some people I've seen

00:40:45.425 --> 00:40:48.883
are very attached to their children

00:40:49.675 --> 00:40:55.841
and they go on pampering, "Oh, my child, my child."

00:40:56.467 --> 00:40:57.841
And suddenly they discover

00:40:58.091 --> 00:41:01.634
the child is now is a devil's child.

00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:04.841
The child starts answering back,

00:41:05.175 --> 00:41:07.841
saying all kinds of things, beating the parents,

00:41:08.175 --> 00:41:11.258
misbehaving, and then they suddenly discover

00:41:11.717 --> 00:41:14.800
that "this is the child whom I have been looking after,

00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:16.133
giving so much love."

00:41:16.425 --> 00:41:18.050
And they feel even worse,

00:41:18.383 --> 00:41:21.800
because "I have done so much for my wife,

00:41:22.133 --> 00:41:23.300
and she is treating me like this."

00:41:23.634 --> 00:41:25.841
"I've done so much for my husband,

00:41:26.175 --> 00:41:27.383
and he is treating me like this."

00:41:27.717 --> 00:41:29.258
Why do you do so much?

00:41:29.509 --> 00:41:30.966
There's no need.

00:41:31.300 --> 00:41:35.383
And if you are doing it, you just do it and you forget it.

00:41:36.509 --> 00:41:37.800
I never feel that way.

00:41:38.175 --> 00:41:40.759
I know of Sahaja yogis for whom I have worked very hard,

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.717
and they have gone down.

00:41:43.050 --> 00:41:44.258
Only thing if I feel anything,

00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:46.300
only God knows where will they jump?

00:41:46.509 --> 00:41:48.133
Where will they be in hell?

00:41:48.383 --> 00:41:51.133
What will happen to them? That's the only concern.

00:41:51.509 --> 00:41:53.133
Not the concern what has happened,

00:41:53.383 --> 00:41:55.799
because nothing can \happen to Me.

00:41:58.592 --> 00:42:00.634
But if they have been sinful

00:42:01.050 --> 00:42:05.509
I just get worried about their future,

00:42:05.883 --> 00:42:08.925
about their lives. That's different.

00:42:09.383 --> 00:42:11.925
So this kind of attachment that is we call in Sanskrit is

00:42:12.258 --> 00:42:14.800
"mamatva" - "this is mine, that's my child,

00:42:15.133 --> 00:42:18.258
my this thing, my that."

00:42:20.925 --> 00:42:24.800
Who are your relations are Sahaja yogis - remember this.

00:42:25.133 --> 00:42:26.883
It's a sentence you must remember,

00:42:27.217 --> 00:42:30.258
"My relations are Sahaja yogis only.

00:42:30.634 --> 00:42:35.008
And anybody who plays against Sahaja yogis,

00:42:35.342 --> 00:42:38.217
troubles Sahaja yogis - that person could be my own wife,

00:42:38.509 --> 00:42:42.050
could be my own child - is not mine."

00:42:43.467 --> 00:42:46.925
Because I'll not allow such a thing to happen.

00:42:47.634 --> 00:42:50.800
This relationship is all right till

00:42:51.258 --> 00:42:55.258
Sahaja yogis are one with each other.

00:42:55.592 --> 00:43:00.258
As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja yogi,

00:43:00.717 --> 00:43:02.799
then I'm not with that person.

00:43:03.008 --> 00:43:04.509
I've seen there are many like that,

00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:06.342
but very good Sahaja yogis.

00:43:06.675 --> 00:43:08.050
They'll never side with their wives,

00:43:08.342 --> 00:43:10.383
never side with their children,

00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.008
because they know if you are siding with them

00:43:14.342 --> 00:43:19.383
you are making them sinful, you're destroying them.

00:43:19.883 --> 00:43:21.467
They're worried about their ascent

00:43:21.799 --> 00:43:24.800
so they'll never allow, never allow anybody,

00:43:25.217 --> 00:43:28.799
a relation of theirs to trouble others.

00:43:30.467 --> 00:43:32.675
I have seen some children

00:43:33.258 --> 00:43:35.675
who are extremely naughty,

00:43:35.925 --> 00:43:38.800
they're very troublesome, very violent,

00:43:39.592 --> 00:43:41.800
and the parents just saying, "Mother, put them right.

00:43:42.133 --> 00:43:45.133
We leave it to You." They are to be put right.

00:43:45.467 --> 00:43:46.509
But others will say,

00:43:46.799 --> 00:43:49.258
"Oh, no, no, no, no; you see my child,

00:43:49.675 --> 00:43:53.008
he cannot do such a thing, you know."

00:43:55.592 --> 00:44:00.675
So one has to understand the discrimination part of it,

00:44:01.050 --> 00:44:04.675
that "Why am I attached?"

00:44:06.008 --> 00:44:07.799
I've given this simile many a times,

00:44:08.050 --> 00:44:09.883
like the sap of the tree rises,

00:44:10.217 --> 00:44:13.675
goes to various places of the trees, various areas,

00:44:13.883 --> 00:44:17.217
looks after the bark, looks after the branch,

00:44:17.509 --> 00:44:19.383
looks after the leaves,

00:44:19.634 --> 00:44:21.425
flowers and fruits, and comes back,

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:24.841
or it gets evaporated. It doesn't get attached.

00:44:25.592 --> 00:44:27.841
If it gets involved into one of them

00:44:28.175 --> 00:44:29.425
the whole tree will die,

00:44:29.759 --> 00:44:32.759
and that part which

00:44:33.133 --> 00:44:37.966
is so close to the sap will also die.

00:44:38.258 --> 00:44:41.592
But sap has much more sense than we have.

00:44:46.467 --> 00:44:48.217
To them, husband's so important

00:44:48.467 --> 00:44:51.675
- I mean so many problems of husbands, wives, this, that.

00:44:51.966 --> 00:44:55.091
"My God," I sometimes think, "What is this?"

00:44:55.383 --> 00:44:58.091
That's why they used to say, "Take a sanyas"

00:44:58.383 --> 00:45:00.008
- so nobody can talk about wife,

00:45:00.342 --> 00:45:01.592
children, nothing.

00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:05.800
You have to be a sanyasi, first of all be a sanyasi.

00:45:06.217 --> 00:45:07.509
So no headache to the guru.

00:45:07.883 --> 00:45:09.258
As soon as you start talking

00:45:09.592 --> 00:45:12.217
about any one relation of yours, the guru would say,

00:45:12.509 --> 00:45:16.217
"All right, you get out. Nothing doing. No good."

00:45:18.634 --> 00:45:21.759
But in Sahaja Yoga -

00:45:22.050 --> 00:45:26.050
Sahaja Yoga has much deeper

00:45:26.800 --> 00:45:28.258
work to do.

00:45:28.509 --> 00:45:30.425
It has to penetrate into the society,

00:45:30.717 --> 00:45:32.717
into the political life, into economic life.

00:45:32.841 --> 00:45:34.799
You have to emancipate the whole world.

00:45:35.091 --> 00:45:37.342
Try to understand your responsibility.

00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:43.759
You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no.

00:45:47.258 --> 00:45:49.258
How much wisdom you must have,

00:45:49.717 --> 00:45:51.509
how much love you must have,

00:45:52.050 --> 00:45:55.008
and how much discrimination you must have,

00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:56.966
to understand that you are chosen

00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.300
for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:46:04.175 --> 00:46:07.925
So now this so-called limited love,

00:46:08.425 --> 00:46:11.592
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

00:46:11.925 --> 00:46:15.050
is the unlimited love.

00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:21.509
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

00:46:24.966 --> 00:46:30.383
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

00:46:32.050 --> 00:46:35.300
that wants your benevolence.

00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:38.509
That's what Shiva is.

00:46:38.800 --> 00:46:41.841
It wants your benevolence.

00:46:43.634 --> 00:46:46.925
It looks after your benevolence.

00:46:47.592 --> 00:46:51.634
So when

00:46:52.717 --> 00:46:57.759
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

00:47:00.634 --> 00:47:04.133
then the whole life changes,

00:47:06.383 --> 00:47:09.300
the whole pattern changes,

00:47:10.050 --> 00:47:12.258
and you really enjoy it because

00:47:12.634 --> 00:47:14.800
you become one with so many,

00:47:15.175 --> 00:47:17.966
concerned with so many families, so many things,

00:47:18.383 --> 00:47:22.675
so many problems of others,

00:47:23.133 --> 00:47:25.799
and you just feel you are one with so many.

00:47:26.133 --> 00:47:29.592
Now see, we are so many Sahaja yogis here today.

00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:32.675
First time when I came to Italy,

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:35.509
I must tell you,

00:47:36.133 --> 00:47:39.133
I came with Christine - no,

00:47:39.467 --> 00:47:43.008
what's the name of Gregoire's wife? Catherine.

00:47:43.550 --> 00:47:46.467
And she was the only one who knew Italian.

00:47:46.841 --> 00:47:48.675
And we had told some newspaper

00:47:49.008 --> 00:47:52.217
to reserve some sort of a hall and advertise for us.

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:54.008
Nothing was done.

00:47:54.342 --> 00:47:57.217
So when we came we couldn't find anyone.

00:47:57.592 --> 00:48:00.799
So I went round with her to put the posters,

00:48:01.133 --> 00:48:03.841
but still nobody came.

00:48:04.425 --> 00:48:06.717
And today we are so many.

00:48:07.091 --> 00:48:11.425
But we must know that we are bound to each other by love,

00:48:14.675 --> 00:48:20.133
and the love that is for our benevolence, for our ascent.

00:48:22.217 --> 00:48:26.425
And then you just start enjoying everyone.

00:48:27.592 --> 00:48:29.883
And then you don't think what race you are,

00:48:30.133 --> 00:48:32.133
what country you are, what this thing you are,

00:48:32.383 --> 00:48:34.467
nothing - a Sahaja yogi, finished!

00:48:34.799 --> 00:48:38.383
So you become a universal being.

00:48:39.592 --> 00:48:42.342
And this attitude has to be achieved.

00:48:42.799 --> 00:48:44.925
When I hear that some Indian girls

00:48:45.342 --> 00:48:49.258
are tortured and troubled, I think, "How can they do it?"

00:48:49.717 --> 00:48:53.800
Or somebody who has a black skin, they are tortured;

00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:56.966
or some Indians are treating somebody

00:48:57.383 --> 00:48:59.509
because they are of low caste.

00:48:59.841 --> 00:49:01.634
It's not possible,

00:49:01.925 --> 00:49:04.841
because they are all part and parcel of one body.

00:49:05.175 --> 00:49:10.091
They're all brothers and sisters, born of the same Mother.

00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.966
But this is only possible

00:49:13.383 --> 00:49:17.258
when you dissolve that limited relationship of yours

00:49:17.634 --> 00:49:20.425
into this great unlimited ocean of love;

00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.800
then only it is possible.

00:49:23.258 --> 00:49:26.050
And if it is not there, do not try to justify

00:49:26.425 --> 00:49:28.800
- just watch yourself.

00:49:29.592 --> 00:49:34.841
See for yourself: are you really in love with everyone?

00:49:36.383 --> 00:49:40.258
You see, I would say that

00:49:41.383 --> 00:49:44.133
all the time when I - sometimes I go for shopping,

00:49:44.383 --> 00:49:47.759
I just think, "Oh, this one would be nice for this one,

00:49:48.050 --> 00:49:50.509
that will be nice for that one."

00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.717
For Myself if you say,

00:49:53.050 --> 00:49:55.425
it's impossible for Me to buy anything for Myself,

00:49:55.717 --> 00:49:59.133
impossible situation.

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.425
Unless and until it is absolutely immediate,

00:50:04.050 --> 00:50:07.717
or some problem is there if I am just without it.

00:50:08.008 --> 00:50:10.759
I won't even buy a drink for Myself,

00:50:11.008 --> 00:50:12.467
even if I am thirsty.

00:50:12.841 --> 00:50:15.799
Because the whole thing is the joy of others.

00:50:16.175 --> 00:50:18.759
"Oh, this will be nice for that person.

00:50:18.883 --> 00:50:21.634
This will be good for that person."

00:50:25.799 --> 00:50:30.550
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

00:50:30.799 --> 00:50:33.883
I mean, why all this is for there?

00:50:34.342 --> 00:50:36.091
After all, think about yourself,

00:50:36.467 --> 00:50:39.342
"Why am I here?

00:50:41.759 --> 00:50:45.300
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

00:50:45.841 --> 00:50:48.675
They are all realized souls,

00:50:49.342 --> 00:50:52.550
such beautiful lotuses.

00:50:53.300 --> 00:50:57.175
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

00:50:57.550 --> 00:51:00.550
Now I am a lotus."

00:51:03.425 --> 00:51:08.883
That is the way you open the heart,

00:51:11.091 --> 00:51:13.759
the lotus of your heart.

00:51:14.091 --> 00:51:18.799
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

00:51:20.008 --> 00:51:24.342
is so beautiful.

00:51:26.342 --> 00:51:28.883
So you are no more divisive,

00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:31.634
you do not want to separate from each other.

00:51:31.883 --> 00:51:36.217
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

00:51:36.550 --> 00:51:38.342
you don't think that it should be done here

00:51:38.675 --> 00:51:40.759
or there or there, but anywhere

00:51:40.966 --> 00:51:45.550
- but should be all of us together.

00:51:47.175 --> 00:51:51.759
So the small attachments that are with you

00:51:52.550 --> 00:51:56.008
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love,

00:51:56.342 --> 00:51:59.841
which is Shiva.

00:52:05.592 --> 00:52:08.883
Fourth one is the most important

00:52:09.425 --> 00:52:11.675
for all of us is to know

00:52:12.008 --> 00:52:15.883
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

00:52:17.258 --> 00:52:19.091
into the heart.

00:52:19.342 --> 00:52:22.675
Starts from the heart, goes up,

00:52:23.467 --> 00:52:25.550
passes through Agnya.

00:52:25.883 --> 00:52:29.592
It has four petals, and opens up.

00:52:34.592 --> 00:52:37.675
This is the one which gives

00:52:38.300 --> 00:52:42.091
you the state which is called as turya.

00:52:42.467 --> 00:52:46.550
We live in three states.

00:52:46.841 --> 00:52:50.342
In the living - in the awakened state,

00:52:50.675 --> 00:52:54.759
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

00:52:54.966 --> 00:52:57.550
we spoil our attention.

00:53:00.091 --> 00:53:04.425
But the second one is the one what we call

00:53:04.759 --> 00:53:06.467
is that we sleep.

00:53:06.675 --> 00:53:10.425
When we sleep also

00:53:11.383 --> 00:53:12.925
all these things that have happened

00:53:13.217 --> 00:53:16.091
come to us from our past and things like that.

00:53:18.217 --> 00:53:22.091
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

00:53:23.759 --> 00:53:27.300
Is a state where

00:53:28.217 --> 00:53:30.550
you have deep sleep,

00:53:30.841 --> 00:53:34.634
and you dream of something that is reality also.

00:53:35.634 --> 00:53:38.759
You may dream about Me.

00:53:39.634 --> 00:53:43.841
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

00:53:44.300 --> 00:53:48.509
where some beautiful

00:53:48.841 --> 00:53:50.550
informations are passed on.

00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:53.050
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

00:53:53.300 --> 00:53:55.175
Italians might know in their sushupti

00:53:55.509 --> 00:53:57.966
that I have come here, or maybe anybody might know

00:53:58.300 --> 00:53:59.966
- depends on.

00:54:00.300 --> 00:54:02.175
But the fourth state is called as turya.

00:54:02.425 --> 00:54:03.759
There are two more states.

00:54:04.050 --> 00:54:05.925
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

00:54:06.258 --> 00:54:07.966
"turya" means fourth.

00:54:08.383 --> 00:54:12.050
Fourth state is where that you are

00:54:12.425 --> 00:54:15.509
in a thoughtless awareness state.

00:54:17.133 --> 00:54:21.966
When there is no thought - just think of it

00:54:22.966 --> 00:54:27.050
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

00:54:27.925 --> 00:54:32.425
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

00:54:33.383 --> 00:54:37.300
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:40.717
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

00:54:40.966 --> 00:54:42.634
is the "turya sthiti."

00:54:42.925 --> 00:54:46.634
And in this state when you are,

00:54:48.425 --> 00:54:52.717
these four petals which are within you

00:54:53.258 --> 00:54:57.050
have to open out in your brain.

00:54:58.759 --> 00:55:02.258
They come from your heart to your brain.

00:55:05.509 --> 00:55:10.425
And that is when

00:55:12.925 --> 00:55:18.634
you absolutely understand what is God,

00:55:23.717 --> 00:55:28.550
absolutely you know what is God is.

00:55:30.634 --> 00:55:35.008
That is the time when

00:55:37.841 --> 00:55:42.091
one receives the real knowledge.

00:55:48.634 --> 00:55:51.675
But unless and until these four petals open,

00:55:51.966 --> 00:55:53.799
one may fall back,

00:55:54.217 --> 00:55:56.883
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

00:55:57.342 --> 00:56:01.883
who are still meddling with things

00:56:02.425 --> 00:56:05.634
that they should not do, go down.

00:56:06.300 --> 00:56:11.008
And they don't understand what is God is.

00:56:12.799 --> 00:56:14.841
But it's not the understanding

00:56:15.175 --> 00:56:17.008
- in a way you understand this one little point,

00:56:17.425 --> 00:56:21.217
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

00:56:21.759 --> 00:56:25.175
not from brain to your heart.

00:56:27.550 --> 00:56:30.467
It comes

00:56:30.841 --> 00:56:34.091
as if the ambrosia of

00:56:34.383 --> 00:56:38.634
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

00:56:41.258 --> 00:56:42.383
Say for example,

00:56:42.634 --> 00:56:45.717
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

00:56:46.008 --> 00:56:47.342
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

00:56:47.634 --> 00:56:50.258
where he described what is God, this, that;

00:56:50.509 --> 00:56:53.008
and "viveka" means the conscience,

00:56:53.383 --> 00:56:57.133
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

00:56:58.509 --> 00:57:00.717
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

00:57:00.966 --> 00:57:04.175
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

00:57:04.509 --> 00:57:05.925
Shankaracharya.

00:57:06.217 --> 00:57:08.509
He said, "No use talking to them."

00:57:08.759 --> 00:57:11.634
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

00:57:11.966 --> 00:57:14.799
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

00:57:15.008 --> 00:57:15.841
praising the Mother.

00:57:16.175 --> 00:57:18.467
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

00:57:18.759 --> 00:57:22.342
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

00:57:22.799 --> 00:57:24.883
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

00:57:25.300 --> 00:57:29.799
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

00:57:30.091 --> 00:57:34.675
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

00:57:35.091 --> 00:57:40.425
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

00:57:40.841 --> 00:57:43.300
And if that is God,

00:57:43.634 --> 00:57:46.841
then how can you suspect anything,

00:57:47.175 --> 00:57:50.175
how can you

00:57:51.133 --> 00:57:53.133
try to analyze anything?

00:57:53.425 --> 00:57:57.133
It's God. It's God Almighty,

00:57:57.592 --> 00:57:59.841
which knows everything,

00:58:00.258 --> 00:58:02.258
which does everything,

00:58:02.717 --> 00:58:05.425
which enjoys everything.

00:58:06.008 --> 00:58:09.800
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

00:58:10.133 --> 00:58:11.841
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

00:58:12.133 --> 00:58:13.258
the pure knowledge.

00:58:13.592 --> 00:58:15.800
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

00:58:16.175 --> 00:58:18.175
not the knowledge of vibrations,

00:58:18.634 --> 00:58:20.425
not the knowledge of kundalini,

00:58:20.759 --> 00:58:25.175
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

00:58:25.675 --> 00:58:29.258
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

00:58:29.592 --> 00:58:30.799
Again I tell you,

00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:35.550
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

00:58:36.342 --> 00:58:43.008
something that comes out of your experience of joy

00:58:43.425 --> 00:58:44.717
and covers your brain.

00:58:44.966 --> 00:58:47.592
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

00:58:47.883 --> 00:58:50.800
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

00:58:51.133 --> 00:58:54.258
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

00:58:54.592 --> 00:58:57.799
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

00:58:58.133 --> 00:58:59.550
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

00:58:59.799 --> 00:59:02.675
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

00:59:03.091 --> 00:59:04.799
The knowledge about your mother,

00:59:05.133 --> 00:59:07.550
the one who has given you birth;

00:59:07.966 --> 00:59:11.425
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

00:59:11.799 --> 00:59:14.133
But knowledge about God,

00:59:14.550 --> 00:59:16.717
that He's love, that He's truth,

00:59:17.091 --> 00:59:18.841
that He knows everything,

00:59:19.217 --> 00:59:24.342
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

00:59:24.675 --> 00:59:29.300
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:33.091
So it's important,

00:59:33.425 --> 00:59:36.342
specially for the people of the West,

00:59:36.675 --> 00:59:38.799
now open your hearts,

00:59:39.091 --> 00:59:43.217
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

00:59:47.592 --> 00:59:50.091
Do not judge people on vibrations.

00:59:50.425 --> 00:59:53.966
Judge yourself, all the time.

00:59:54.425 --> 00:59:59.425
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

00:59:59.675 --> 01:00:01.717
more understanding, more this thing;

01:00:02.008 --> 01:00:07.883
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

01:00:09.550 --> 01:00:14.800
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

01:00:15.258 --> 01:00:18.091
it's God.

01:00:18.550 --> 01:00:22.550
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

01:00:25.050 --> 01:00:28.383
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

01:00:28.634 --> 01:00:32.050
She may be anything, but I know Her.

01:00:32.550 --> 01:00:34.175
It cannot be described in one book,

01:00:34.425 --> 01:00:37.091
it cannot be described in hundred books.

01:00:37.550 --> 01:00:40.509
It cannot be described in words,

01:00:40.841 --> 01:00:45.425
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

01:00:45.925 --> 01:00:48.717
God Almighty.

01:00:51.008 --> 01:00:53.799
And that gives you

01:00:54.091 --> 01:00:57.675
that beautiful surrender,

01:00:58.091 --> 01:01:01.883
where you just feel absolutely secured

01:01:04.342 --> 01:01:07.342
in that ocean of love.

01:01:08.133 --> 01:01:10.800
I wish you all to achieve that state.

01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:15.258
May God bless you.
