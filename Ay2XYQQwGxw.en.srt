1
00:00:03,493 --> 00:00:11,993
"YOU ARE YOUR OWN MASTER"

2
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:21,992
These days, Kali Yuga is the modern times,

3
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:24,938
what was the Kali Yuga, the days
of confusion, is over,

4
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:31,398
and is called as Krita Yuga, means where
this living force will act,

5
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:36,195
and this living force has to act through
you. You become the medium

6
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:40,494
of that living force. Actually you become
the master of that.

7
00:00:41,302 --> 00:00:47,628
How it happens is automatically
by the grace of God it works out.

8
00:00:47,829 --> 00:00:52,104
You cannot sell anything that is the grace
of God. What is the value of that?

9
00:00:52,305 --> 00:00:54,963
On this point only many people discard
Sahaja Yoga

10
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:58,721
because they think that it cannot be sold,
so it must be useless.

11
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:04,167
It is so invaluable that you cannot pay
for it.

12
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:10,745
Now the rising of the Kundalini has to take
place, first of all.

13
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:14,768
But with these three advantages,
the fourth advantage is the highest:

14
00:01:14,969 --> 00:01:22,651
that you become the Spirit. The Spirit
is the one who is the master in you.

15
00:01:22,852 --> 00:01:26,932
So you become your own master,
you become your own guru.

16
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:31,049
Nobody has to tell you ‘do this’ or
‘do that’; you are guided.

17
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:35,260
Because as soon as the Kundalini rises,

18
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,565
you start feeling the cool breeze
in your hands.

19
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:43,970
And these are giving you a new vibrations,
a new dimension

20
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:46,321
by which you know whether to do
this or not.

21
00:01:46,522 --> 00:01:51,134
For example, you want to do something;
you want to buy a book.

22
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:54,743
You don’t have to decide about it:
as soon as you go near the book,

23
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:59,446
either it will give you cool breeze,
or it may make you hot,

24
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:02,509
or may little bit burn also if it’s
a horrid one,

25
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,594
and you don’t want to have that at any
cost, you want to have the cool breeze

26
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,938
because you enjoy it. So you just give up.

27
00:02:09,139 --> 00:02:12,866
You just give up things without anybody
telling you,

28
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,298
because your vibrations tell you.

29
00:02:15,499 --> 00:02:20,061
The Spirit that is now shining (in)
your attention, tells you,

30
00:02:20,262 --> 00:02:24,421
and you start understanding that now
I have become my own guru,

31
00:02:24,622 --> 00:02:29,585
because your guru is sitting inside you
as the Spirit.

32
00:02:29,786 --> 00:02:34,920
It has not yet manifested in your attention
and that’s why you are worried.

33
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:39,163
But just it manifests, and once
it manifests you are amazed,

34
00:02:39,364 --> 00:02:42,241
that you yourself will have become
a guru of yourself.

35
00:02:42,442 --> 00:02:46,413
You don’t need anybody else to tell you,
but you can do it yourself.

36
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:50,804
You can find out yourself. Nobody has
to give any explanation,

37
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:58,139
or correction, or anything, you just
start improving yourself.

38
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:03,467
Automatically it works, and little bit,
if you know how to decode it,

39
00:03:03,668 --> 00:03:09,452
and how to work it out, your problems,
you just manage it.

40
00:03:09,653 --> 00:03:15,139
You become yourself a guru.
That’s the thing you have to be.

41
00:03:15,786 --> 00:03:20,382
So, today the master within us, within us
is the Spirit.

42
00:03:20,583 --> 00:03:24,507
But before Realization, we are not
the master

43
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:29,561
because the master has not come
in our conscious mind.

44
00:03:29,762 --> 00:03:32,482
It is not expressing in our conscious mind.

45
00:03:32,683 --> 00:03:39,975
In the sense that we are not empowered
by Its powers.

46
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:46,550
The Spirit exists; It has Its own powers.
But we haven’t felt those powers within us.

47
00:03:46,751 --> 00:03:49,497
Once we feel the powers of the Spirit,

48
00:03:49,698 --> 00:03:54,333
we are empowered by our own powers
which are there.

49
00:03:54,502 --> 00:03:59,385
The powers are within us. These are
our own powers.

50
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,840
We don’t have to borrow from anyone,
ask from anyone, they are in ourselves.

51
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:08,736
The Spirit is within us - only thing
that Spirit has to give light

52
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:17,044
in our, in our consciousness. It has
to come in our consciousness.

53
00:04:17,245 --> 00:04:20,991
In simple medical terminology we can
see, say

54
00:04:21,192 --> 00:04:28,458
that the Spirit must manifest Itself
in our central nervous system,

55
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:31,275
in our central nervous system.

56
00:04:32,065 --> 00:04:34,669
Is very simple. That you become master
of yourself

57
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:40,099
and you master the disease also,
you master everything.

58
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:45,387
Because the master is within you,
it has not come

59
00:04:45,588 --> 00:04:48,155
in your conscious mind is the only link
is left,

60
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:52,356
and when that happens Yoga takes place,
union takes place.

61
00:04:52,557 --> 00:05:00,013
We should now completely keep ourselves
limited to Self Realization,

62
00:05:00,229 --> 00:05:03,833
about God I’ll tell next time.
Self-Realization means

63
00:05:04,034 --> 00:05:08,778
to bring your Spirit into your conscious
mind.

64
00:05:09,916 --> 00:05:12,630
And that’s what you have to become,
the master.

65
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:17,513
And that mastery is very simple because
it’s all built within you,

66
00:05:17,698 --> 00:05:20,194
just it has to be connected.

67
00:05:20,395 --> 00:05:24,743
Like, anything like a television set
is to be connected to the mains,

68
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:27,100
it’s all built in, it’s there, it just
starts working.

69
00:05:27,301 --> 00:05:31,264
In the same way, you are that,
you are that.

70
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:35,024
Just it is to be connected. Whatever
may be your caste,

71
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:40,243
community, race, nationality, shapes,
heights –

72
00:05:40,444 --> 00:05:45,133
anything, whatever you may be – makes
no difference because all of you have got

73
00:05:45,334 --> 00:05:50,085
this great thing within you, this power
of a rebirth

74
00:05:50,308 --> 00:05:56,616
and you are to be born again, and you
will be born again. Why not today?

75
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:07,948
When we talk about realization one has
to know,

76
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:14,607
first of all, that we have to have patience
with ourselves.

77
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:21,293
I know some people [who] don't feel
so good,

78
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:29,649
some people still have sicknesses, some
people don't even feel vibrations sometimes.

79
00:06:30,837 --> 00:06:35,577
Have patience with yourselves!
When you become your own guru...

80
00:06:35,778 --> 00:06:42,912
first thing as the guru has patience
with his or her disciple,

81
00:06:43,113 --> 00:06:47,050
you must have patience with yourself.

82
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:56,534
In that patience you will learn

83
00:06:56,735 --> 00:07:05,389
that you can tolerate so many things
without any trouble.

84
00:07:06,633 --> 00:07:09,402
There’s, say, one person who goes on
grudging:

85
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:13,441
"Oh, this is not good, that is not good"...

86
00:07:18,174 --> 00:07:22,722
Because they have no patience
with themselves.

87
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:30,803
If you have patience with yourself,
everything you’ll accept.

88
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:37,056
Wherever you are, you are with your Self
because you are realized souls.

89
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:44,388
So you won't frustrate, you’ll not
get angry,

90
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:52,748
and also you will not go on grumbling
and grudging,

91
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:56,532
because you are enjoying your Self.

92
00:07:57,384 --> 00:08:01,892
So, to develop the Guru principle
within you, first of all

93
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,838
you must develop yourself, fully.

94
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:11,057
Now, how to develop yourself for Guru
principle, one must see.

95
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:18,143
We have got the ten principles within you,
as I told you before,

96
00:08:18,344 --> 00:08:21,900
and we should develop these all ten
principles in such a way

97
00:08:22,101 --> 00:08:26,000
that we stand out from others.

98
00:08:26,415 --> 00:08:30,587
There should be Absolute Truths within you.

99
00:08:33,475 --> 00:08:38,829
So much so, that you should manifest them.
And all these truths have powers.

100
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:45,165
By every truth that is within you
established.

101
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:49,790
You don’t have to do anything, they
work out themselves.

102
00:08:50,069 --> 00:08:55,243
So, first of all, you must get your chakras
all right;

103
00:08:55,444 --> 00:08:59,258
on the chakras, you must put
your attention;

104
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:04,525
after the Samadhi state, you will start
opening them out properly.

105
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:07,978
Clear them out. Know what are
the chakras that are bad.

106
00:09:08,179 --> 00:09:12,019
I’ve  seen people who have very bad
few chakras,

107
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,370
and many good chakras, but they will be
only enjoying the good chakras

108
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:20,141
and will not worry about the bad ones.
Pay attention to your bad chakras.

109
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:25,268
Cleanse them, cleanse them.
Put all your attention to that.

110
00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:30,893
But it will happen. It will happen,
once you get your Realization,

111
00:09:31,094 --> 00:09:34,690
the attention will be very, very nicely
placed.

112
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:40,901
Now, when you people know that this
has happened to you,

113
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:50,026
and when you become the master, you know
the brake and the accelerator in you.

114
00:09:50,227 --> 00:09:55,495
But still, actually you are not the master,
you are still the driver.

115
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:58,885
And when you are a driver, you
automatically do it driving,

116
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:01,800
but still one should not say that you are
a driver.

117
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:07,315
You know the balancing of it, you know
how to maneuver it, how to act.

118
00:10:07,516 --> 00:10:12,940
But then, what happens? To become
the master, what do you do?

119
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:18,850
This Realization takes place. Then you
become the master, and you see the driver,

120
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:23,093
you see the accelerator, and you see
the brake in yourself.

121
00:10:23,294 --> 00:10:25,679
And you just enjoy like a master.

122
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:29,562
When you become the master, you cannot
be slave of anything.

123
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:34,437
No more slavery, the real freedom lies
in becoming the master of yourself.

124
00:10:34,638 --> 00:10:37,273
No use mastering others, just master
yourself.

125
00:10:37,474 --> 00:10:42,015
But that mastering cannot be done
by lecturing or by brainwashing,

126
00:10:42,216 --> 00:10:45,413
or by talking to you, but it’s a happening
that has to take place,

127
00:10:45,614 --> 00:10:50,023
the Kundalini has to rise and has
to give you Realization.

128
00:10:50,224 --> 00:10:55,609
This, unless and until this happens
we should not say that we know.

129
00:10:55,810 --> 00:11:01,140
Know, knowledge - is not, when we are
not one with the Divine.

130
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:07,064
It’s like a machine or you can say
telephone not connected.

131
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:10,806
We have to get our connection first,
establish the connection,

132
00:11:11,007 --> 00:11:14,275
and then we become the knower.

133
00:11:14,476 --> 00:11:18,525
And the knowledge becomes a part
and parcel of you.

134
00:11:18,726 --> 00:11:21,009
But this cannot happen to stupid people.

135
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,922
It’s not meant for stupid at all, neither
for the cowardly.

136
00:11:25,123 --> 00:11:31,555
It is meant for people who are courageous,
who are people of wisdom,

137
00:11:31,756 --> 00:11:36,290
who are not given to nonsensical things
easily.

138
00:11:36,491 --> 00:11:39,829
That`s why in Sahaja Yoga there are
two forces working all the time.

139
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,040
You may get your Realization today here,

140
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,563
but I won’t say that you’ll sustain it.
I won’t guarantee that.

141
00:11:45,764 --> 00:11:50,547
The reason is, we have two forces, one is
centripetal and another is centrifugal.

142
00:11:50,748 --> 00:11:54,805
By one force you are attracted towards it,
by another force you’re thrown out.

143
00:11:55,006 --> 00:11:59,001
Because you have come out of matter.
And the matter tries to drag you down.

144
00:11:59,202 --> 00:12:02,173
You have to master it, in such a way
that the Spirit

145
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:06,540
sits on the top of the matter. And
the matter doesn’t dominate you anymore.

146
00:12:06,741 --> 00:12:11,665
And for that you have to meditate,
and you will be in meditation.

147
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:14,954
It’s simple thing to be done, there’s
nothing difficult.

148
00:12:15,154 --> 00:12:18,258
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest method.

149
00:12:20,304 --> 00:12:24,090
Now you must know that the Spirit
is your guide,

150
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:28,121
that you are your own guru, you are
your own master.

151
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:35,041
For this you have to put this right hand
just on the left-hand side of your stomach

152
00:12:35,249 --> 00:12:41,275
to nourish your guru principle.
Left hand side.

153
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:46,248
At this point you have to say,

154
00:12:47,401 --> 00:12:53,783
with full confidence, “Mother, I am
my own master.”

155
00:12:53,984 --> 00:12:57,127
“Mother, I am my own guru.”

156
00:12:57,328 --> 00:13:01,151
“Mother, I am my own guide.”

157
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:06,485
Say it ten times. With full confidence.

158
00:13:14,638 --> 00:13:17,202
See the vibrations will improve.

159
00:13:17,403 --> 00:13:21,177
Now don’t think of any other gurus.
Forget them.

160
00:13:21,378 --> 00:13:25,170
You are your own guru. You don’t
need a guru.

161
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:28,061
You are a saint.

162
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:36,694
The Spirit is going to guide you, your
vibratory awareness is going to guide you.

163
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:46,115
Now in our mantras we say that,
“Mother, I am my own Guru.”

164
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:50,361
But, saying that, do we realise that:

165
00:13:50,562 --> 00:13:57,354
if I am my own Guru, this “I” and
“my Guru,”

166
00:13:57,555 --> 00:14:01,697
between the two, what have I achieved?

167
00:14:01,898 --> 00:14:06,973
Where am I? Can I guide myself?

168
00:14:07,174 --> 00:14:13,229
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my
attention so well established and manifested

169
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,515
that I can guide myself and guide others
later on?

170
00:14:19,716 --> 00:14:24,915
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important

171
00:14:25,116 --> 00:14:30,040
that you see to yourself –
the introspection:

172
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:36,567
Can I be my own Guru? Have I become
my own Guru?

173
00:14:38,698 --> 00:14:45,126
So, in the introspection you find out
what’s gone wrong with you,

174
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:50,258
how you are made this way.

175
00:14:51,537 --> 00:15:01,168
“What’s wrong in my own personality
it has come from all the surroundings

176
00:15:01,369 --> 00:15:06,003
and the way people have been putting
ideas into my head.”

177
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:11,089
You should have your own ideas;

178
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:15,419
you shouldn’t worry what Plato said and
what Socrates said and what this thing said

179
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,177
What do you think?

180
00:15:20,862 --> 00:15:23,801
After all, you are enlightened people.

181
00:15:24,908 --> 00:15:30,449
And when you start, you see, seeing
this way yourself, then you’ll be amazed

182
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:35,595
a kind of a sweet humor about yourself
develops.

183
00:15:35,796 --> 00:15:41,627
And you really become a very interesting,
magnetic personality,

184
00:15:45,047 --> 00:15:49,805
and a very enjoyable person, extremely
enjoyable.

185
00:15:50,006 --> 00:15:53,283
Everybody will seek your company.

186
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:59,720
This is what is the sign of your Guru
Principle being enlightened.

187
00:15:59,905 --> 00:16:02,845
Of course, they have said that you should
get detachment;

188
00:16:03,053 --> 00:16:07,025
you should not have any attachment
to this and that and that and that.

189
00:16:07,226 --> 00:16:13,595
This is all talking. But actually,
only introspection

190
00:16:13,796 --> 00:16:24,994
and assumption or, we can say,
the knowledge of your own depth,

191
00:16:25,195 --> 00:16:29,274
itself, will give you that feeling.

192
00:16:30,499 --> 00:16:36,406
If you have that knowledge that
I’m a Sahaja yogi,

193
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:42,633
and my depth of divinity is so great,

194
00:16:44,563 --> 00:16:54,964
that itself will be more than sufficient
for you to exist as the topmost guru.

195
00:16:55,539 --> 00:16:59,790
So everywhere you start seeing
Sahaja Yoga, when your heart

196
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:03,555
knows what your brain knows.

197
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:08,714
I’ve known people who know all the mantras
very well, everything very well

198
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:13,589
and all that, but in the heart.
So put it in the heart.

199
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:22,347
In Sahaja Yoga the guru is not through
his brain but through his heart.

200
00:17:23,446 --> 00:17:27,133
May God bless you all.
