1
00:00:02,680 --> 00:00:06,080
I am overjoyed really today

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,880
to see you all here

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,440
to celebrate the Diwali Puja.

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:19,480
We were to be in Portugal

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,640
but it was not so - so we are here.

6
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,520
Diwali Puja is a very small puja

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,400
but extremely significant.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,400
Firstly in Diwali,

9
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,800
the first day they buy something

10
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,320
for the family.

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:55,480
You can - maybe some cooking utensil could be,

12
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,360
an ornament for the wife

13
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,320
or something like that.

14
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:07,600
Because that is the day of housewife.

15
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,680
And that day is to be celebrated

16
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,600
as the housewife’s, I should say, homage to her.

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,560
As a result you know in India even now

18
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:30,480
housewives are very much respected.

19
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:32,640
Actually they are respected all over.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:39,000
You will be amazed that even

21
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,240
in the protocol of the government

22
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:47,480
receptions anywhere

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,680
the wife is very important.

24
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,880
And where she is sitting,

25
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,440
what is her position is very important.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,840
Even today

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:04,240
in the most modern and advanced countries also

28
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:07,320
they have a special respect for the housewife.

29
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,680
The housewife may not be educated,

30
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:15,080
she may be a very simple woman,

31
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,000
she may not be very modern.

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:24,720
There was an experience for Me:

33
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,240
in London we had a program

34
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,120
where we all were invited,

35
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:40,200
and the head of the delegation,

36
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,760
his wife was missing.

37
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,920
So they asked Me, “Where is she?"

38
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:50,120
Because there is a seat for her, she has to sit there.

39
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,000
I said, “I don’t know, I didn’t see her.

40
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,280
She must be somewhere here.”

41
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,240
So just before starting

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,480
I went to the washing room

43
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,480
and I was surprised

44
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,480
she was sitting in the waiting room there.

45
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,600
I said, “What are you doing here?

46
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,560
They are all waiting for you outside.”

47
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,800
So she said, “They asked me to sit here.”

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,720
So I went out and I told them

49
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,560
“Now she is sitting there. Why…

50
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,000
why don’t you call her to sit in her seat?”

51
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,240
“Is she the wife?”

52
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:32,400
I said, “Yes, of course, she is the wife.”

53
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:35,320
“We thought she was some secretary.”

54
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,240
I said, “What made you think?”

55
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,440
This lady had, you see, very modern ideas -

56
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:45,600
wearing a very modern slick dress and all that and

57
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:47,120
and everybody thought

58
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:50,120
this lady must be the secretary at the most.

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,360
So they made her sit in the waiting room.

60
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:58,240
You see - So it is expected of a housewife

61
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:02,440
to be decently dressed, honorably dressed

62
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,920
and not to dress up like a secretary

63
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,560
or somebody who is just in the office.

64
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,760
Because she is regarded as the highest -

65
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,320
whether you like it or not.

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,360
But she had permed her hair

67
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,200
and she has been to a very expensive place

68
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,720
for all decorations and everything.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,000
And poor thing, when she arrived

70
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:34,800
they put her in the waiting room near the bathroom.

71
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:38,240
That’s what it is.

72
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:41,200
So for a housewife,

73
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,080
she is the dignity of the household.

74
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,320
Not only that, but she is responsible

75
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,200
for the complete culture of that country,

76
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,600
complete culture of that country.

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,560
They represent the culture.

78
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,680
Like in India nowadays they have started

79
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,120
in the films showing all kinds of funny, funny dresses.

80
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,400
But I haven’t seen any housewife wearing that.

81
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,320
I haven’t seen anybody.

82
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,280
It’s not in reality, it’s only in the film,

83
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,920
because the society is so strong

84
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,920
and the housewife is supposed to be a decent person.

85
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,360
She has to be decent,

86
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,680
she has to be very dignified

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,640
and she has to behave in a dignified manner.

88
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,680
On the contrary I would say,

89
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:41,560
we had a prime minister called Lal Bahadur Shastri.

90
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,720
His wife was absolutely uneducated

91
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,120
because Shastriji went to jail

92
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,480
and she couldn’t take her education -

93
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,160
very simple, ordinary woman.

94
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,880
And she went to France.

95
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,400
That time there was this Mr. de Gaulle,

96
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
he was the president.

97
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,200
And his wife was another very simple woman.

98
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,120
So Shastriji told her

99
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,640
that “You are not to cry when you are leaving Mrs. de Gaulle,

100
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,320
now you’ve become great friends.”

101
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,240
God knows she didn’t know French

102
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,080
and she didn’t know Hindi,

103
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,400
but somehow both of them became great friends,

104
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,400
on the level of housewives.

105
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,160
And when he warned her not to cry,

106
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,320
what happened that they started crying

107
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,080
when they had to leave.

108
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:36,680
So Shastriji said, “I told you not to cry."

109
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,000
She said, “It is she, this French lady started crying.

110
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:43,600
What can I do? I had to cry with her.”

111
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:47,920
So you see, it’s a kind of a great

112
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:51,000
collectivity of housewives

113
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,200
that has to work out.

114
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,000
They have common problems,

115
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,160
they have to face their children,

116
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,920
they have to look after the household,

117
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:05,720
everything – I mean there are so many common problems

118
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,920
with the housewives.

119
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,600
And the housewife also

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
knows all little, little things.

121
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:17,000
You see, men at least in India don’t know much

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,920
because they live in the air, I think.

123
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,000
So the women have more sense

124
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,000
in this respect, for small, small things

125
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,200
they are quite aware.

126
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,800
It’s very interesting sometimes,

127
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,320
the men commit mistakes

128
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:41,240
of such a great humor.

129
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,000
Because they do not deal with day-to-day life,

130
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:51,640
with all the problems of daily life.

131
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,720
On one side the woman,

132
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,600
housewife, has to deal with the daily life.

133
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:02,040
On the other side she has to look after her family,

134
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,880
her children.

135
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,640
Also, poor thing, she is responsible

136
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,840
for the society.

137
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:12,880
She has to maintain the society.

138
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,520
In a country where women are sensible

139
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,080
and are matured,

140
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,520
you will be amazed that they become

141
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,000
extremely good families,

142
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,480
good societies and good children.

143
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,320
That’s why I must say,

144
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,520
India is a very good country of very good society.

145
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:38,440
This is come out of the housewives,

146
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:41,160
the Gruha Lakshmis of the house,

147
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,720
who have done all the work that is important

148
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,640
as far as the culture is concerned.

149
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,680
This kind of thing is very much in India

150
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,520
and with that, what you find

151
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,880
that the people respect,

152
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,080
respect the housewives.

153
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:07,280
So respecting the housewife

154
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,760
is the most important thing in our Sahaj culture.

155
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,120
But that doesn’t mean that

156
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,080
the women should try to dominate and trouble

157
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:24,080
and fight with the husbands.

158
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:30,080
But it means a very important position

159
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,800
in the society, of a housewife.

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,560
She is treated as a something a, like a devi only.

161
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,600
But she too has to be a devi.

162
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,920
If you treat her like a doormat,

163
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,920
then children will never respect her.

164
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,680
If you don’t pay proper respect to her,

165
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,160
the children won’t respect the mother

166
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,440
and there will be no impact

167
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,160
of the mother on the children.

168
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:05,680
As a result the children get wayward,

169
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:09,440
and in the societies or in the countries

170
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,680
where the mother is not respected,

171
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,000
you will find the children become extremely dominating,

172
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:23,240
hot-tempered and horribly uncollective.

173
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,000
So it’s very important that on this day

174
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:30,040
we call it Dhanteras - the thirteenth day -

175
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:33,840
you have to buy something for your wife,

176
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:37,280
and you have to give her something as a present.

177
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:42,000
At least you should buy a little pot

178
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:46,360
or something that can be used in the kitchen

179
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,120
to show your respect to her.

180
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,560
In the families where mother is not respected

181
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,160
children become extremely troublesome

182
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,640
and the whole, their family also suffers -

183
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:03,120
wherever they are married, whatever happens to them.

184
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,280
Men have to realize, it is their mistake

185
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:11,320
that they have never respected their wife as they should have.

186
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,280
In the presence of the children if they shout,

187
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,000
in the presence of the children if they don’t show any respect,

188
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,000
the children can never respect the mother.

189
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,480
It is something, a criminal thing to do

190
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,520
to women who are in the household

191
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,640
doing all the work for you,

192
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,560
looking after you, your family,

193
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,920
not demanding anything.

194
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,200
Only if you want to understand

195
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,080
how they can be troublesome,

196
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,480
is see them in the politics.

197
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:50,040
When they go in the politics they put all men upside-down.

198
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,480
And one woman can put all of them in their proper senses.

199
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,560
Because their field is their house, their family.

200
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,120
If they are not respected in the family,

201
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:05,280
they get out of the family

202
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:09,320
and behave in such manner that you can’t imagine.

203
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,800
Though she has to bear a lot,

204
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,480
she has to suffer a lot,

205
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,200
but in the family she must be respected.

206
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:24,360
That’s a very, very important message of Gruha Lakshmi.

207
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:30,360
Then the second day is the one where

208
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,240
this horrible rakshasa called as Narakasura was killed.

209
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:43,000
Always all killing is done with the power of the Shakti.

210
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:49,240
This Narakasura was the fellow who had tortured so many people

211
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:53,280
and had done lots of cunning stuff.

212
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,080
He was a very treacherous, cunning man

213
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,160
and it was impossible to kill him.

214
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,120
But then somehow or other,

215
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:07,080
with the advent of a special power

216
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:10,120
that this Narakasura was killed.

217
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:14,800
That was the another day, fourth day,

218
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,600
where Narakasura was killed.

219
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:21,280
They say that when he was killed,

220
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:25,160
the door of hell was closed.

221
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:29,120
So people should take their baths early in the morning.

222
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,560
But I am of the opinion

223
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,240
that day if the door is open, better not take bath.

224
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Be in your beds

225
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:43,040
till this fellow is put fully into narak.

226
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:46,000
You should not bother about him.

227
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,000
“Naraka” means hell.

228
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,560
And from the hell

229
00:13:50,760 --> 00:13:55,000
they extracted him and killed him.

230
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,520
The last one is the best,

231
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,720
where they have the meeting of Shri Rama

232
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
and His brother Bharat.

233
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,480
Shri Rama went to jail, obeying His father.

234
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,360
And for fourteen years

235
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:15,240
He was – not a jail but in a, we could say,

236
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,480
He went in the forest

237
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,240
as a - it was a kind of a jail only, because

238
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,120
He was living in the palaces and He was sent in the

239
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,880
forest by His father

240
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,680
and his daughter-in-law;

241
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:34,480
also I mean it’s His own wife.

242
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,640
And also the brother, they went together

243
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,000
into great sufferings.

244
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,240
And you know the whole story of Ramayana.

245
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,240
The child

246
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,000
that lived in the palaces

247
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,200
had to go in the forest

248
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:00,000
and live in terrible conditions,

249
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,040
when He was to be the king.

250
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,160
Was too much.

251
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:09,160
But Sita went with Him

252
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,000
and She supported Him

253
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,760
and ultimately it so happened that

254
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:25,680
Ravana came and took away Sita.

255
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,080
But Shri Rama fought Ravana,

256
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:31,720
killed him and brought back His wife.

257
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,800
But when they came back

258
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:38,440
to their own capital in Ayodhya,

259
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,560
there was a big jubilation

260
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,040
and Bharat, His brother -

261
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:46,440
he was very much attached to his brother

262
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,680
and he ruled that country

263
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,120
with the paduka -

264
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,480
they say is the kind of sandalwood chappals

265
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,280
they use – of his brother.

266
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:05,000
He put it on the throne and ruled.

267
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:07,840
So that is how the Bharat milan-

268
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,480
the meeting of Bharat with Shri Rama-

269
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,800
is celebrated,

270
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,800
and that was the time He was crowned also

271
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,320
as the king.

272
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,000
So it is long time back,

273
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,520
thousands of years back

274
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,120
this thing has happened.

275
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,240
That jubilation is very significant

276
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,440
that the right king gets His own throne,

277
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,600
and He rules.

278
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,160
And all the injustice

279
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,800
and all kind of atrocities He has gone through

280
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,200
has to be completely finished from His life.

281
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:46,120
And that’s why Diwali is important.

282
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:51,920
So the last day they worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

283
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,160
Because it is Her blessings

284
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,400
that brought forth all these beautiful meetings.

285
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,880
And that’s why they worship Her, Lakshmi, as such.

286
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:07,680
But there are nine types of Lakshmis within us,

287
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,160
which I think I have told you sometimes back.

288
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:15,800
Now in that Lakshmi Puja is this, that

289
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,280
you worship the Lakshmi Herself.

290
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,320
It doesn’t mean money,

291
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:21,600
not at all.

292
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,840
To worship money is wrong.

293
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:26,000
But what it means that

294
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,480
Lakshmi is the money which is with us -

295
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:33,040
or the whatever prosperity with that -

296
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,600
should be very carefully spent,

297
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,640
because She is very mobile

298
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,760
and the money can slip out.

299
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:46,920
On the contrary you should not be at all miserly.

300
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,240
Miserly people – Lakshmi is not happy.

301
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,120
But if you want to spend,

302
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,480
you must spend it in the right way,

303
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:58,920
otherwise the money is spent in the wrong way.

304
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:08,480
Now when the Lakshmi was created -

305
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,480
you must be knowing

306
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,800
out of the churning of the sea She came out.

307
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:16,680
She had four hands,

308
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:20,160
one hand was to give.

309
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,200
She is generous, She gives.

310
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,720
Like this She gives,

311
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:29,800
and with one hand She blesses.

312
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,680
These are Her two hands.

313
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,360
One is to give, and to bless the person.

314
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,360
Very important it is,

315
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:43,920
that when you give to somebody something,

316
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,000
you forget about it,

317
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,600
and you bless that person.

318
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,320
Not only you give money,

319
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,680
but also you bless that person.

320
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,000
The other two hands

321
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,200
have got two lotuses of pink color.

322
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,320
Pink is the color of love.

323
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,680
And a person who has money

324
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:12,680
should have a house

325
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:16,040
which is full of love.

326
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,560
Any guest who comes in the house

327
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,880
should be respected.

328
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:25,880
He should be treated just like God.

329
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,520
In India you have noticed how

330
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,880
they think foreigners -

331
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,000
“foreigners” means God to them.

332
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:34,000
Here “foreigner” is a bad word,

333
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
but in India is very respectable.

334
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,840
If you are a foreigner

335
00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:40,160
means that you are God.

336
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,720
How they have looked after you, you know that, in India.

337
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,280
This is the reason,

338
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,680
this is the basic culture of India

339
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,240
that anybody who is a guest -

340
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,520
he may be anything -

341
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,840
if he is a guest

342
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:57,120
then he is to be treated like God.

343
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,160
In the other countries it’s just the other way round, you know.

344
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,560
If you are a foreigner

345
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,120
then people think it’s not even proper to talk to that person.

346
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:12,440
I don’t know how the mentality is like that.

347
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:29,480
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

348
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,680
Sahaja yogis are not like that.

349
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:38,120
They treat the guests very well, I’ve heard.

350
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,080
They look after each other

351
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,520
and they are beautifully collective.

352
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,600
So this is what is the meaning of the lotus,

353
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,400
is a house full of love.

354
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,920
Like a beetle which has got even thorns,

355
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,240
when it comes to the lotus, the lotus open out

356
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,080
and the beetle goes inside

357
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:07,280
and sleeps very nicely and comfortably.

358
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,920
Even the beetle - undisturbed.

359
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,920
That is how one should treat, if you have money.

360
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,480
But here what I find

361
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,920
in the world now, if you have money

362
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,920
you become yourself like a beetle.

363
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,680
They’re so full of thorns and horrible ideas,

364
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,680
so insulting, and think no end of yourself.

365
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,000
It’s just surprising is

366
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,480
that money which should give them

367
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:39,440
the form of Lakshmi

368
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:41,000
- Lakshmi Swarupa -

369
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,200
they become like devils.

370
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:48,200
And the way they treat other people is even worse than that.

371
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,680
So these are the significance of the form of the Goddess.

372
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,240
But the best is, She’s just standing on the lotus.

373
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,280
That means no pressure on anyone.

374
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,240
She exists on Her own - no pressure.

375
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:07,560
She doesn’t put any pressure on anyone,

376
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,040
just on Her own She stands

377
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:16,680
and all Her weight and all balanced on Her own dignity.

378
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,480
This is the way a Lakshmi should be.

379
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,720
And that’s how, if it is, when happens

380
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:27,480
in the countries where people are having now financial crisis

381
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:31,840
and all kinds of crisis, things will improve.

382
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:36,200
People will enjoy. They don’t enjoy their money, nothing.

383
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,280
They don’t enjoy. This is just aggressiveness

384
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,720
and also funny ideas

385
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:48,160
of having a, something, very expensive things

386
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:53,280
and what you call the designers.

387
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:57,440
Now I think these are designers are anti-Lakshmi,

388
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,160
that they have come.

389
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,000
Because they are extracting all your money nicely

390
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,120
and all your money goes to waste.

391
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,080
If not that, then people take to womanizing or to drinking -

392
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:14,040
such wasteful habits.

393
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,400
They don’t do anything which we can call as

394
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,320
really the blessing of the Lakshmi.

395
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:23,520
So one has to remember

396
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:27,280
that when you want to give something to someone

397
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,280
do it with the full heart.

398
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
Such full heart that

399
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,200
it forms that Lakshmi Prasada.

400
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,680
You see, that should happen, otherwise

401
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,480
what’s the use of giving presents to anyone?

402
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:45,440
You see, they are very funny people, you know

403
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:51,080
who give presents out of a very narrow outlook.

404
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:56,160
But they try to give presents.

405
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,200
Like in Japan, if you go,

406
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,480
they’ll give you such a big present.

407
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:04,680
You go on opening and opening and opening and opening it,

408
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:09,280
till you come to a point when you’ll get a matchbox.

409
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,000
In the matchbox - inside the matchbox,

410
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:16,120
you will take two,

411
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,560
you can say, it’s two doll-like things made out of

412
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,320
small little those matchsticks.

413
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,680
Start looking at them

414
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:30,640
“What this is, why such a big design?”

415
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,640
and very surprising.

416
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:37,400
But they are very simple people otherwise, very simple.

417
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,800
When we went there, they told us

418
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,160
they – wherever we went, you know even in a shop when it was raining

419
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,840
they would give us a present.

420
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:49,360
Now I said, “What is this?

421
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,280
Why are they giving us a present like this?”

422
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,360
So the lady who was translating, she said

423
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,920
“They think You are from a royal family.”

424
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:01,600
I said, “What makes them feel we are from a royal family?”

425
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,680
“Because You don’t go to hairdresser.”

426
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:06,000
I said, “Really?”

427
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:11,800
“Yes. In Japan, royal family people never go to a hairdresser.”

428
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:16,120
I said, “I didn’t know this, that they don’t go to the hairdresser.”

429
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,720
“That’s why they think, You are from the royal family.”

430
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,840
Just imagine what ideas people have about

431
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,600
hairdressing and all that.

432
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:33,920
But in India or these places

433
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:38,440
a woman must be properly combed - her hair.

434
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,480
She shouldn’t look like a hippie going round, you know.

435
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:45,440
Because we have many people who

436
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,120
still believe in a kind of a hippieism

437
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:52,000
and they wear their hairdress like that.

438
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:56,680
Now, woman plays a very big part in the society as I told you.

439
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,720
Whatever way she wears, whatever where she goes about,

440
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,200
also the children pick up much more

441
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,160
then from the mother than from the father.

442
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:09,200
Sometimes could be much more from the father also.

443
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:12,840
But actually the, all the refined things

444
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:15,320
are picked up from the mother.

445
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,760
So it is more for the ladies

446
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,880
to understand how they dress up, how they live.

447
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,560
Nowadays – I went to London

448
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,000
and I’ve asked one Indian Sahaja yogini

449
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,920
“What is the fashion now?”

450
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,560
So she said “jipreya” in Marathi.

451
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:35,760
“Jipreya” means if you put your hair like this is.

452
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,200
See in India, if we have hair like this

453
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,320
the mother will say “Now remove your jipreyas.”

454
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,440
Because if you put like that hair your eyes can become squinty.

455
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:49,840
But that’s the fashion to put the hair like this, you see -

456
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,680
very much, sometimes on the eyes also.

457
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,800
So that’s a jipreya fashion.

458
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,400
And this now is quite common I find everybody

459
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:00,720
dignified ladies also,

460
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,640
except for Mrs. Thatcher,

461
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,360
everybody puts on this kind of a thing.

462
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,040
I don’t know how Mrs. Thatcher has escaped it.

463
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:12,080
But anybody who does anything

464
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,400
that should not be followed by women.

465
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,920
It’s very slavish.

466
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,600
Because this is the fashion, that’s why they do it.

467
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,880
That’s the fashion, so they do it.

468
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,640
It’s absolutely stupid to do that way

469
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:27,120
and to play into the hands of these people who make fashions.

470
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
Because you are independent.

471
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,640
You must stand on your own character.

472
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,640
you must stand on your own understanding of things.

473
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:37,520
Instead of ruining your faces

474
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:40,280
you should try to improve them

475
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,920
by your dignity, by your

476
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,440
understanding.

477
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:51,480
Now it’s more on the women - I am sorry to say -

478
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,440
Lakshmi Puja is more on the women

479
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,400
that what they have to understand,

480
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,080
what they have to be, how they should be.

481
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,480
I have always told you

482
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:09,120
that it’s necessary for a woman to be dignified,

483
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,680
very much more than the man.

484
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,600
Man can be stupid – doesn’t matter, you see,

485
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,120
doesn’t matter so much.

486
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,560
But women have to be dignified and sensible.

487
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,680
And men, as it is, don’t know much

488
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,360
as you know that very well.

489
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:24,640
Poor things, you know,

490
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:26,720
they are

491
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:34,000
They are educated only in the universities.

492
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:36,840
But as far as the practical side is concerned,

493
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,840
they don’t know anything.

494
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,480
So one should not feel bad about it.

495
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:47,240
I mean, it’s very enjoyable

496
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,840
to see the way men make mistake and

497
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,520
then they go on saying “No, no, I know this, I know that,”

498
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,760
and they don’t know anything!

499
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,720
So - But man will never say, “I don’t know.”

500
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,160
You see, that’s his character.

501
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,880
It’s all right.

502
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,560
You must know that he doesn’t mean it,

503
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,520
because he really doesn’t know anything!

504
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,720
Also in art.

505
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:29,760
I don’t think men know much about art,

506
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,280
and also their one side is missing is aesthetics.

507
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:41,000
Poor things, they make one type of clothes

508
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,280
wear all throughout.

509
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:47,480
Just one type of dresses they will make

510
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:50,800
and that they will make and wear throughout.

511
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,720
They don’t have any demand.

512
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,680
But women are artistic.

513
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:00,400
And if our Indian women give up wearing saris

514
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,000
and take to jeans, where will the villagers go?

515
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,800
Because they live with their saris that they make

516
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,640
during holidays and things like that.

517
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,160
So in India is not possible to introduce

518
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,440
all these dresses.

519
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,200
In the school maybe,

520
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:21,160
but later on they all give up, because they like saris.

521
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,720
So the saris are still on

522
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:27,360
and will be on because it’s so artistic,

523
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,840
it’s so beautiful.

524
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:32,000
One sari doesn’t look like another sari.

525
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:35,560
So the idea of beauty and the idea of art

526
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,920
much more with the women, not with the men.

527
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,000
And so one should see that

528
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,080
if men don’t know, doesn’t matter.

529
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:50,680
But you make your houses absolutely artistic.

530
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,720
Make it comfortable like the lotus, as I said,

531
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
that should be such.

532
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,480
But some of the ladies

533
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:03,800
can be very much like a Hitler, you know,

534
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,240
in the household, very dictating.

535
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,080
“This should be like this, that should be like that,”

536
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:13,360
making the life of men absolutely miserable.

537
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,000
I have known a person

538
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:19,040
who used to carry a newspaper in his house.

539
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,280
So I said, “Why do you carry it all the time?”

540
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,600
He said, “Whenever I sit,

541
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,920
I put the newspaper first and then I sit.”

542
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:26,680
“Why?”

543
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,400
“Because if it is spoilt a little bit

544
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,800
my wife will shout at me.”

545
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:34,200
I said, “Why?”

546
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,360
“Because she doesn’t like anything to be spoilt.

547
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,040
So she’s so particular.

548
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,880
I carry a newspaper always with me -

549
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:45,600
wherever I have to sit I put the newspaper."

550
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,440
I said, “It’s too much.”

551
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,200
He said, “You will also have to do that, I tell You.”

552
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:03,480
So very particular about the whole house

553
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,320
that it’s impossible to live in that house.

554
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,320
It’s even worse than a hospital.

555
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:14,160
So some women can be very particular about that

556
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:17,840
and very methodical, could be.

557
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:23,120
But normally women should be very loving

558
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,360
and extremely accommodating,

559
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:31,360
and also being friendly with all the family members,

560
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:33,400
with everyone.

561
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:38,480
It’s very important that I’ve a family so big.

562
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:41,120
We have a very large family,

563
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,880
so many brothers and sisters

564
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:48,120
and everybody one better than the other.

565
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,680
It is so remarkable that

566
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:57,000
everybody has a different type of a perfume, I think,

567
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,560
or a kind of a fragrance

568
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,280
that shows an individual personality in them.

569
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:07,360
Despite that they are all so nice and so good,

570
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:10,920
so accommodating and so much enjoying,

571
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,160
that it’s remarkable how people live together.

572
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,840
Specially in Russia I found the women are very adaptable

573
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:21,560
and very humorous.

574
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,200
And they were making fun of everything

575
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,800
and enjoying life.

576
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:32,240
Very surprising, we had taken presents for them.

577
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,160
But we had taken for about two thousand people,

578
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,200
but there were sixteen thousand people.

579
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:41,880
So how could we give these presents?

580
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,440
So the women took out their chains

581
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,120
and they said, “All right, we’ll give it to men, all right.

582
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,920
We’ll give them our ear-tops, all right,”

583
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,080
and they were making fun of men,

584
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:56,240
who were feeling bad that they couldn’t get anything.

585
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:00,280
Such fun, you know, such understanding.

586
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,560
Because they are not so money-oriented I think

587
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:08,400
and they are very spiritual-minded.

588
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,560
So a spiritual woman wouldn’t bother about other things like this

589
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,320
and will keep a dignity of her own

590
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,360
and will show by her every gesture

591
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:21,400
that she is spiritual.

592
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:25,320
This is something so sweet, you know.

593
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,000
As I was telling you, on one side

594
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,120
sometimes you feel

595
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:36,320
a little different, say, I said it about Japan.

596
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:39,680
But in the same Japan when I went there,

597
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,600
I liked their tiles very much.

598
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,280
So they were building up something,

599
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,680
I liked the design of their tiles.

600
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,480
So I said, “Can I take one from here?”

601
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:56,760
“No, no, doesn’t matter. We’ll send it to Your ship.”

602
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,240
And on the ship a big load

603
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:02,640
of those tiles arrived.

604
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,120
And the captain asked Me, “Now what are we to do?”

605
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,680
I said, “How did you get it?”

606
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,440
He said, “They brought it to You.”

607
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:12,920
All kinds of varieties of those tiles,

608
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,760
can you imagine?

609
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,040
So on one side it is

610
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,320
a way of expression,

611
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,600
on the other side is different.

612
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,320
So one should understand also.

613
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,240
When somebody gives you something

614
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,200
you should understand

615
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:36,000
what is the significance of that,

616
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,320
and not to feel bad about it.

617
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:42,560
The significance of that could be very much great,

618
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:44,320
you may not understand.

619
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,520
So better to ask, why they have given you these things.

620
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,920
That is what is, what we call auspiciousness,

621
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:55,440
one of the great qualities of the Lakshmi is,

622
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,800
that it should be auspicious.

623
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:03,240
Whatever you give should be auspicious.

624
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,160
Like sometimes

625
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:07,760
I have seen little children out of mischief

626
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,000
will bring a lizard and try to give you.

627
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,520
I mean, it’s very inauspicious to do that.

628
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,440
But they are not told that it’s inauspicious,

629
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:18,160
so they are doing like that.

630
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,280
They have to be told it’s not auspicious,

631
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:22,440
it will not please the Goddess.

632
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:25,080
So that has to be understood very well

633
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:28,920
that you should not try to insult

634
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:33,080
the Lakshmi by giving something which is wrong.

635
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,520
If you don’t know, you should find out

636
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:37,760
and do it properly.

637
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,560
In this way this is the Diwali thing.

638
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,000
But the greatest message of this is

639
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,080
that the kingdom was given to Shri Rama.

640
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,920
Shri Rama was the embodiment of justice

641
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,200
and fair play.

642
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,840
And this was given to Him.

643
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,120
In the same way we have to feel

644
00:37:05,320 --> 00:37:11,720
that our expression of gratitude,

645
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,880
our expression of love should be such that it should be

646
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,400
given to a person who is a symbol

647
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,640
of such greatness like Shri Ram.

648
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,200
It’s a very, very subtle thing one should try to understand.

649
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,320
If you don’t want to give, you should not give.

650
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:37,800
But if you want to give, then you must give something

651
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,840
which is worth the person to whom you are giving.

652
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:45,200
That is one of the lessons you should have

653
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:51,880
about Shri Rama’s temperament.

654
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,720
When He went into the village

655
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,680
and He found there was an old woman

656
00:37:57,880 --> 00:38:03,600
and this old woman had all her teeth out practically.

657
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,680
And she was from the aboriginal

658
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:11,440
and she gave Him some

659
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:17,320
we call them “ber” - is something like

660
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,320
is a kind of a fruit, small fruits.

661
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,880
And she said, “See, I have tasted all of them

662
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:31,000
and all of them are very sweet.

663
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,320
Because You should not have something which is not sweet.

664
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,280
So I have tasted them with my tooth,

665
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:41,080
I have put my tooth on to them and I have tasted it.

666
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,200
So please have them.”

667
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,000
Immediately He took it.

668
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:47,680
But His brother Lakshmana got very angry

669
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:50,360
that it’s very inauspicious in India,

670
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,640
if you have put something in the mouth

671
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,680
and then you want to give to somebody

672
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:58,160
is something [utishta ? ] – is not to be done.

673
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:01,760
But Shri Rama said

674
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,880
“I have never eaten such beautiful fruits.

675
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:08,120
They are the most beautiful fruits I have eaten.”

676
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:09,440
So His wife says

677
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:13,640
“Also give Me some. After all, I am Your half

678
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,240
this thing, You must give Me.”

679
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:19,760
So Shri Rama gave Her some.

680
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,880
She said, “Wow, what a thing it is, tremendous.”

681
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:28,160
She ate it and then the Lakshmana says

682
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,400
“Give me also, sister-in-law.”

683
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,480
She said, “Just now you were saying

684
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,600
all kinds of things against this lady.

685
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,200
Why do you want to have it?”

686
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,320
He said, “Now please forgive me and give me.”

687
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,520
So, see, it shows

688
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,720
that Shri Rama could see her love,

689
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,920
her vibrations in those fruits

690
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:52,000
that she had offered.

691
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,360
And He could appreciate

692
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:57,880
to that extent that He gave it to His wife

693
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,320
and the wife also joined hands with Him.

694
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,880
This is what it is.

695
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,440
That whatever you do, you do it with love.

696
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:08,440
If you do it with love,

697
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,480
you will be able to make it auspicious.

698
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,920
But if there’s no love, you are just doing for some purpose,

699
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,040
then it is useless.

700
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,040
So this is what is there for giving; giving to the

701
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:31,360
person like Shri Ram,

702
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:36,520
and to such a great incarnation.

703
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,400
She just thought of her love

704
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,640
and she gave it to Him.

705
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,440
In the same way you have to be very simple,

706
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:51,880
simple-hearted, and then you will know what is the best to be done.

707
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,880
So today is, actually the Diwali is over

708
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,440
and I want to wish you again and again a happy Diwali

709
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:03,080
and a very prosperous new year.

710
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:07,480
May God bless you all.

711
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:53,680
The same Lakshmi becomes Mahalakshmi.

712
00:41:53,880 --> 00:41:57,600
That is, when you understand

713
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,080
the value of money

714
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,280
and when you are saturated

715
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:10,880
and you are fed up.

716
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:14,200
From inside you get detached,

717
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:20,080
then a new form of Lakshmi comes forward,

718
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,880
that is Mahalakshmi.

719
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:27,040
That’s the power which takes you higher and higher,

720
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,080
which is the spiritual awakening.

721
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:34,800
You have seen in all the countries which are very rich,

722
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,800
this desire started

723
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:42,600
that they should seek the truth, they should find out the truth

724
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,320
and that’s how you are all here.

725
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:50,000
That means Mahalakshmi Power started working in you,

726
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,640
that you were seeking the truth.

727
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:56,600
And while seeking the truth you came to Sahaja Yoga.

728
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,600
So this Mahalakshmi

729
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:01,560
is very important for you also.

730
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,200
And you know Kolhapur, there’s a temple of this Mahalakshmi

731
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,280
which came out of the Mother Earth.

732
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:12,680
But they themselves didn’t know that

733
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:19,320
in that temple why they sang “Jogawa,” which said that

734
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,320
“O Ambe, awaken.”

735
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:24,280
Ambe is the Kundalini.

736
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:28,520
So why in Mahalakshmi’s temple they sang?

737
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:31,200
You can understand that, why

738
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:35,000
in that temple they started singing

739
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,120
the song of “Jogawa” by which to raise the Kundalini.
