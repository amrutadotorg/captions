00:00:13.384 --> 00:00:22.892
The second very important point is of
complete integration within and without.

00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:27.089
Within, unless and until there is
integration,

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.664
we cannot bring forth the outside
integration.

00:00:32.643 --> 00:00:39.929
The complete integration within, comes
by dedicating yourself

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.398
to your own improvement.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:53.566
First and foremost is: time must be given
for your development.

00:00:53.767 --> 00:00:59.381
Not to show Me or not to show anyone!
It is between you and yourself.

00:00:59.582 --> 00:01:04.650
You have to work hard to cleanse yourself.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.200
Easy to live comfortably with all
the horrible chakras within us,

00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:25.655
but it is easier also and the best, most
enjoyable is, to have very clean chakras.

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:31.100
And it comes [by], first of all,
is sincerity.

00:01:32.817 --> 00:01:40.157
First of all is complete sincerity.
Are we sincere to ourselves?

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:45.050
Sometimes it is misunderstood. People think
if you have to be sincere to ourself

00:01:45.251 --> 00:01:48.298
we should deny Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:54.439
Sahaja Yoga is the union between you
and God,

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:01.878
and the sincerity must be full, must be
complete.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:09.504
Any kind of insincerity which comes into
you is extremely detrimental.

00:02:10.838 --> 00:02:17.048
So you must know that, as your Mother
has sincerity about you,

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:22.567
you must also have sincerity about
yourself.

00:02:25.022 --> 00:02:27.854
Then you will start enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:28.055 --> 00:02:33.009
That is very important to create
integration within you

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.072
because if it is sincerity, it comes from
your heart.

00:02:37.273 --> 00:02:41.807
If it is coming from your heart then your
body, your mind,

00:02:42.008 --> 00:02:49.160
your intelligence, everything will work
hard to fulfil it.

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:55.520
But if it is not coming from your heart
it is going to be a superficial thing.

00:02:55.721 --> 00:03:00.455
So you try to feel it from your heart.

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:06.175
That’s what it means: sincerity.
Do not depend on anyone –

00:03:06.376 --> 00:03:13.462
your wife, husband, children – nothing –
mother, father. It’s your own.

00:03:15.991 --> 00:03:20.277
So you have to work in such a way that
you get complete integration

00:03:20.478 --> 00:03:28.041
and the driving force towards integration
is a very simple one: is sincerity.

00:03:30.843 --> 00:03:39.266
Thus you will know that automatically you
are getting integrated.

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:44.678
The another factor [which] is important
is patience.

00:03:45.445 --> 00:03:48.854
You must have patience with others,

00:03:49.055 --> 00:03:54.956
because if you do not have patience
your sincerity will start doubting itself.

00:03:55.157 --> 00:03:59.104
So you must have patience and to get
patience

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:05.443
you must know what you have been so far
and where are you.

00:04:05.644 --> 00:04:08.792
When you will know what you were, you will
have patience with others,

00:04:08.993 --> 00:04:11.962
tremendous patience.

00:04:12.613 --> 00:04:20.261
And by having patience with others your
sincerity will be all the time complete.

00:04:20.478 --> 00:04:25.347
By your sincerity you will be completely
integrated.

00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:29.790
So we come to the point of sincerity.

00:04:29.991 --> 00:04:36.057
Now let us go deeper into it: how
the sincerity is to be maintained.

00:04:36.805 --> 00:04:41.246
First of all we have to make some
determinations,

00:04:41.447 --> 00:04:44.945
sankalpas (vows), of being sincere.

00:04:45.146 --> 00:04:53.272
Then we have to act by finding out how
do we get insincere on what points.

00:04:53.473 --> 00:04:57.017
You are good at analysing [so] you can
find it out:

00:04:57.218 --> 00:05:00.908
how do you get insincere, on what points
you get insincere,

00:05:01.109 --> 00:05:02.878
what are the correcting points.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:06.889
Keep a control on your mind to see how
does it become insincere.

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:12.115
You’ll be amazed that it’s simple to be
sincere than to be insincere.

00:05:12.316 --> 00:05:18.082
Is the easiest thing is to be sincere than
to be deceiving

00:05:18.283 --> 00:05:24.095
because you don’t have to think. To be
sincere you don’t have to think.

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:29.253
If you have to be insincere you have
to think, plan out and to find out methods,

00:05:29.454 --> 00:05:35.047
all the loopholes and escapes, by which
you have to run away.

00:05:35.248 --> 00:05:40.783
If you have to be captive of your sincerity
you don’t have to worry about anything

00:05:40.984 --> 00:05:45.046
and that sincerity itself is rewarding.

00:05:45.247 --> 00:05:48.871
This principle must be written down
in your hearts

00:05:49.072 --> 00:05:52.770
that sincerity itself is rewarding.

00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:57.606
You don’t have to go to anybody else

00:05:57.807 --> 00:06:03.913
to ask for the reward of sincerity,
sincerity itself rewards you.

00:06:04.183 --> 00:06:08.415
And that’s why you start enjoying your
own sincerity.

00:06:08.616 --> 00:06:12.181
If you start seeing all these things
as a witness,

00:06:12.382 --> 00:06:18.644
that how your sincerity has made you
so beautiful, so dignified

00:06:18.845 --> 00:06:24.108
and how you have started rising in your
self-esteem,

00:06:25.123 --> 00:06:29.564
you’ll be amazed how sincerity itself
is a big force

00:06:29.765 --> 00:06:36.612
which will manifest its living dynamism
in you

00:06:36.813 --> 00:06:39.162
and you’ll be a transformed person.

00:06:39.363 --> 00:06:44.558
This transformation within you is going
to change the whole world.

00:06:44.758 --> 00:06:51.254
People are going to see that you are
no more a confused person,

00:06:51.463 --> 00:06:56.616
you are not a person who is doubting and
neither you are a person who is a fanatic.

00:06:56.817 --> 00:07:01.612
You are not a blind person and you are
a person who is alert and aware

00:07:01.813 --> 00:07:05.919
and who can see things better than others.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.368
So, Divine is only interested in such
people.

00:07:10.569 --> 00:07:16.755
As I have told you before that Divine
is more interested

00:07:16.956 --> 00:07:25.012
in a little worm which is alert and aware
than in a palace of a king which is dead.

00:07:25.213 --> 00:07:31.783
The more alert you become the more Divine
takes interest in you.

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:38.661
But this alertness is nothing but
the enlightenment of your sincerity.

00:07:38.862 --> 00:07:42.538
You’ll be amazed how sincerity is
the thing.

00:07:42.739 --> 00:07:49.386
That means you are loyal to yourself.
You have to be loyal and not disloyal.

00:07:49.587 --> 00:07:56.735
The loyalty to yourself is sincerity and
that is how I have managed Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:56.936 --> 00:08:03.115
But sincerity is My nature, I don’t have
to strive for it. I cannot get out of it.

00:08:03.316 --> 00:08:11.029
While, if I am your ideal you should try
to imbibe My nature, within yourself.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:18.170
And then you will be amazed how you are
connected with Me.

00:08:18.371 --> 00:08:27.985
Then we all move like one wave, one being,
one personality.

00:08:28.559 --> 00:08:35.008
That is the achievement of this
Sahasrar Day.

00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:43.944
Sincerity of purpose brought in action,
not theory and philosophy,

00:08:44.145 --> 00:08:52.198
but in action, active sincerity, in every
way, and patience –

00:08:52.399 --> 00:08:58.428
all these things will bring forth
the complete integration within.

00:08:59.532 --> 00:09:02.532
Try to become sincere and sincere

00:09:02.733 --> 00:09:08.005
and sincere and enjoy your sincerity.

00:09:17.232 --> 00:09:22.484
I bless you all with your sincerity.
