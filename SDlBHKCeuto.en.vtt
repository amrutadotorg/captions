00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.450
1983-1121 Pre-Christmas Evening

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.170
Sorry for this delay but today there is something great luck for us.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.690
A gentleman has come from Delhi

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.610
with the plans of our ashram in Delhi

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:04.450
and within two-three days we could make another plan.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.530
A much better plan for Delhi people

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.210
and he came to see us this evening and I had to discuss it with him

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.850
and I am sure he'll manage it very well

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.210
and he's invited Allen to go to India

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.970
and he's going to look after Allen there

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.570
and he's going to make him stay in India

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.690
where Allen is going to work out the whole thing.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.530
So let’s give a hand to Allen. (Everyone applauds for Allen).

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.050
It’s very God sent we must understand again

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.130
the Ritambhara Pragya is working out

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.850
Let him be seated somewhere.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.090
There's a guest we have, can we give a room somewhere?

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:20.730
So, it was pointed out by Warren

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.450
that he'll have to work here for two years,

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:32.450
he cannot practice as an architect and he has to put so much money

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.530
to ensure and all kinds of problems are here.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.130
And suddenly today we find somebody who is willing

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.450
to take him up in India and send him abroad

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.450
and all those things are there.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:47.490
So you can imagine how things work out for him

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.210
but there should be dedication and understanding

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.170
about Sahaja Yoga first of all, that’s very important.

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.690
Now, today in the beginning of the whole thing

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:03.210
I don’t want to say something that will not make you happy.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:10.130
Today is a day of great happiness and joy and that we have to know

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.970
that Christ came on this earth

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.530
to deliver us from our sins and our karmas

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.970
and it was such a sacrifice

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:32.770
He went into which we cannot see

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.570
or visualize with human understanding.

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.530
It was too much for a person who was so powerful

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.570
to get into a position where

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.450
he had to forget that he was so powerful and go through all that

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:54.730
and treated just like an ordinary person.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.770
It was too much but he did it

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.050
just because that drama was to be played

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.570
because Agnya Chakra was to be opened out.

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.970
But we have to understand that though he has done all that,

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:12.530
our karmas are being taken away as you know that

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.930
as soon as the kundalini is awakened, you know that

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.530
kundalini cannot be awakened if your karmas aren't clean.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.890
You cannot, that’s why in the olden days

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:28.850
people used to go to Himalayas and all those farfetched places

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.930
used to clean their karmas clean their bodies clean everything

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:35.450
and then they used to get awakening of the kundalini,

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.570
they used to get realization.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.050
But the way we have got realization thanks to Christ

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.530
that Agnya Chakra could be opened out

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:46.450
and that I could manage that.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:50.770
But we do not realize that once that is done

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:56.170
that means you are now entitled to get your realization

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:58.810
because of your Agnya Chakra being opened out

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:02.970
that your Sahastrara can be opened out.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.850
But, the punishment of the karmas has been taken away.

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.810
You have been given such a higher position

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:19.850
that you suddenly become Saints and you get all the knowledge

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:23.170
that Saints cannot have about Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:26.930
about the Shudha Vidya, the Nirmal Vidya,

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.570
you get all the knowledge of the Spirit.

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:40.930
But the problem is I find that we have certain special problems

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.170
belonging to the special countries also

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:50.130
and my attention has been on England very much, you know that

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.170
and I have really worked here very hard, 10 years I have worked

00:05:56.850 --> 00:06:00.170
and for English Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:10.450
what are they lacking in just our own understanding of ourselves

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:15.850
which should be done with proper critical eye

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:19.730
so that we understand what is our problem.

00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.450
Of course, the karmas have been forgiven, you can see that.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.850
No problem of the karmas are there,

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:30.770
but the problem that exists within us

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.770
is also little bit from this country itself.

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.490
The first is that this is a country of tamo guna

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.890
because it is in a very high altitude placed

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:47.090
and it is very cold country

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:52.450
and people are used to drinking and all those things.

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:57.530
So, the generations have done that, so it has gone into more tamo guna

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:00.690
and now it is so saturated that tamo guna.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.970
When once upon a time, it was on the right side,

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.010
now it has gone onto the left side

00:07:06.170 --> 00:07:10.890
because the whole saturation of that drinking and all those things

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:16.170
have brought this tamo guna to settle down in this country.

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:25.570
So, the first problem is of tamo and tamo guna makes you

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:32.170
with your intelligence explain everything automatically.

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:37.450
So, the intelligence has a capacity to cheat itself.

00:07:37.850 --> 00:07:41.010
So, the intelligence tells you – see now, all right

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:45.170
if we have to get up in the morning that maybe all right in India

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:50.450
but in England maybe too much (Sahaja Yogis laugh).

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:53.970
That’s special intelligence

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:00.450
and then you see the progress compared to other people becomes slow,

00:08:00.930 --> 00:08:03.970
despite mother is working so hard here.

00:08:05.050 --> 00:08:08.890
The second thing is that tamo gunis, you see,

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:12.490
because they have to live with their tamo guna,

00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.770
they become very shallow and their depth is missing

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.450
because they are on the other side of it

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:23.050
and they do not touch their depth

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:25.850
so they can live very superficially you see.

00:08:26.010 --> 00:08:29.130
Ah, whatever they do they don’t feel anything.

00:08:29.450 --> 00:08:31.810
They are not ashamed of it; they are not touched by it.

00:08:32.050 --> 00:08:36.890
Whatever it is, at the most they blame a bhoots of their, that’s all.

00:08:37.090 --> 00:08:39.850
But otherwise in a shallow everyone.

00:08:40.250 --> 00:08:43.530
They do not touch it that much where they should touch

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.930
because of tamo guna.

00:08:46.170 --> 00:08:51.090
Now, as it is this is the heart of the Universe

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.810
and a person who has a heart is the most deep personality

00:08:58.770 --> 00:09:00.810
because you see doing with the heart.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:04.450
Anything done with the heart means you are all out for it.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:08.530
So just the other way around it is that sometimes when we are shallow,

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:16.130
there's no heart, nothing, we do something without the heart.

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:21.210
Now, as you have seen in the Ashtanga Yogas,

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.770
there is a many a times I have said Ishvara Pranidhana is the first.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:29.610
Now what is Ishvara Pranidhana, we must understand.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:37.450
Ishvara Pranidhana is the establishment of God in your heart.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:40.250
Now, how do you do?

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:46.450
You see, you see a mantra, you are just saying it outwardly.

00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:52.090
You are clearing out outwardly. You are meditating outwardly.

00:09:52.770 --> 00:09:57.170
But when you are saying that,

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:02.650
you are just using your right side

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:08.810
or your left side but not your heart.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:12.650
So, what you have to do is to balance it.

00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:17.770
When you are saying something, say it with devotion, with dedication,

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:22.650
with understanding and try to put it in your heart that

00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:32.970
"Whatever I am saying is a mantra given to me by Adi Shakti herself."

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:36.130
So is a mantra very powerful.

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.890
But the mantras also lose their powers

00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:41.810
if you do not have the Ishvara Pranidhana.

00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:46.450
That means your Ishvara must be established in your heart

00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:50.450
and this is what we lack is that when we do something

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:54.450
we just do outwardly in a shallow manner.

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:57.530
And if you are shallow you will be playing with this.

00:10:57.770 --> 00:11:00.450
Now playing games is a very common thing with us

00:11:00.610 --> 00:11:03.450
because you see people with Tamasa what else will they do.

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.770
I mean they are lazy lumps.

00:11:05.970 --> 00:11:09.450
So, the mind has to be used. You see, mind doesn’t stop, isn’t it?

00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.970
It's working all the time and we are lazy, doing nothing.

00:11:13.210 --> 00:11:17.450
So, the mind plays on its own and then we should understand that

00:11:17.530 --> 00:11:20.450
this mind is the one that makes you shallow.

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.970
We make faces as if we are very happy before mother

00:11:24.130 --> 00:11:25.450
or something like that

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.450
or we say we are very this thing and we have achieved this and that

00:11:28.530 --> 00:11:31.450
suppose but she knows.

00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:38.850
So, what we have to do is to feel what we want to say,

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:40.450
what we have to do.

00:11:40.530 --> 00:11:45.610
That is Ishvara Pranidhana. It should not be superficial.

00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:49.930
I have seen people, Oh Mother! This that this that.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:54.530
Just coming from the lips only sometimes.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:57.450
It should come from the heart.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:01.450
Try to feel that. You will see the joy will be much more.

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:05.650
You're trying to give me joy. You try to give yourself that joy.

00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.650
That’s what you are feeling within your heart.

00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:11.770
Try to feel that in your heart.

00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:15.050
When the Ishvara Pranidhana is established.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:20.530
But this is one of the problems is the Tamasa.

00:12:20.970 --> 00:12:24.770
But when they were aggressive in this country then their aggression

00:12:24.930 --> 00:12:29.450
you see they created another problem is to sort of a condition our minds.

00:12:29.610 --> 00:12:32.450
This also we should face directly.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:36.450
Specially for Britishers, it is important to face that, very important

00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:40.890
because I have been noticing it is happening. Now what happens?

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:44.450
Supposing, you are an aggressor means what do you do?

00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:46.010
I would see in a stark way,

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.450
just forget that you are Britisher just go away from it.

00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:56.610
You just think like this that this is your house then you become quite hefty

00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.450
and you go and attack another person, driving him out of his house,

00:13:00.530 --> 00:13:08.170
stay there nicely for 300 years. It is that. As simple as that.

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:11.530
That’s what the forefathers have done here

00:13:11.810 --> 00:13:15.450
and they have conditioned our mind, means what have we done.

00:13:15.530 --> 00:13:19.450
That means you have no respect for anybody else's culture.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.770
Simple as that.

00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:26.930
That they showed no respect for anybody else's life.

00:13:27.490 --> 00:13:30.450
To them, they were the ones that could occupy other countries,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:35.130
they could capture other countries and live there, dominate there.

00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.130
But as a result of that the conditioning is still in the minds

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:48.970
because when we live, say in the ashram - I was very happy to know

00:13:49.130 --> 00:13:54.450
that the ashram of Brighton is looking so much better,

00:13:55.570 --> 00:13:58.930
people are looking after, is a very big thing

00:13:59.090 --> 00:14:01.970
that shows that you respect.

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:07.130
That place which is a holy place you are looking after it.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:12.770
Otherwise, formerly the ashram was this that the bills would rise,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:17.610
so high that everybody became bankrupt with that.

00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.850
Everything was broken. Everything was thrown away.

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:23.970
They lived the way they like. All the lights were on all the time.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.050
All the fire was on. This happened that happened. I mean,

00:14:27.210 --> 00:14:30.970
impossible to put them together in any place it was like that.

00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:37.770
Today, I was so happy to learn that it is an ashram where people respect.

00:14:38.250 --> 00:14:44.170
So, to be more on the right side we should know, do we respect.

00:14:44.610 --> 00:14:47.450
Do we respect others' properties?

00:14:47.770 --> 00:14:54.450
This is not others', this is Mother’s property. I mean, ah,

00:14:54.530 --> 00:14:59.690
you give them any sofa set, after 10 days you go and see it's all

00:14:59.850 --> 00:15:07.450
broken, finished. Anything it used to happen like that.

00:15:07.530 --> 00:15:11.530
Now, this should come that we have to respect.

00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:14.810
We have to respect now the property

00:15:14.970 --> 00:15:19.450
which is first of all started with Sahaja Yoga property

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:24.450
and then it will start with others. We have to respect.

00:15:25.010 --> 00:15:29.010
Then another conditioning that we have from the society

00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:33.170
we must face it, is very funny is this that nobody

00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:38.730
respects anybody’s wife or anybody’s husband. They are married

00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:42.690
but their eyes will be on somebody’s wife, somebody's husband.

00:15:43.490 --> 00:15:48.450
How can you do that? See to the subtle side,

00:15:48.530 --> 00:15:50.570
because now you have become subtler people

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:54.450
and you must see these problems exist in our country

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:59.050
that we have got this conditioning around us is all this going on.

00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:04.730
Somebody’s wife is going with somebody’s husband. No respect.

00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:09.450
They are married people, how can you carry on with somebody’s wife

00:16:09.530 --> 00:16:11.570
or somebody’s husband.

00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:15.130
Just think of the society in which we live. Isn’t it?

00:16:15.490 --> 00:16:17.890
Now somebody is married to someone,

00:16:18.650 --> 00:16:25.570
now you cannot carry on with a person who belongs to somebody else.

00:16:26.090 --> 00:16:28.530
Is a simple thing like that.

00:16:28.930 --> 00:16:33.450
But is all, you see in the society you live in that kind of a society.

00:16:33.890 --> 00:16:36.170
I mean every day we have here such news,

00:16:36.490 --> 00:16:38.650
I mean it’s just shocking sometimes.

00:16:38.890 --> 00:16:40.170
So, we have to face the problems with which you are living

00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:41.930
like Indians have their own problems

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:44.850
and they are horrid on that line.

00:16:45.050 --> 00:16:48.450
So, we have to face our problems so first of all we have to know

00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:51.770
that we must establish the Ishvara Pranidhana.

00:16:52.130 --> 00:16:55.930
Sahaja Yoga cannot be established by people who are shallow,

00:16:56.210 --> 00:16:58.530
who are superficially in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.730
Some people think they can play about,

00:17:00.890 --> 00:17:04.650
they feel happy by disturbing the ashramites,

00:17:04.810 --> 00:17:07.530
by talking against the ashram people about Sahaja Yogis,

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.010
many I have seen,

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:13.210
Sahaja Yogis are a horrid people as if other people are better.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:19.450
They go on like that playing. Now, what is the thing they lose.

00:17:19.530 --> 00:17:21.890
They are the losers. They don’t understand this.

00:17:22.170 --> 00:17:25.570
By doing this kind of a thing you are the loser.

00:17:25.890 --> 00:17:29.570
Whom are you playing with? You are playing against with yourself.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:34.570
Those people who try to criticize Sahaja yogis must know that

00:17:34.770 --> 00:17:39.450
they are cutting themselves out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:39.890 --> 00:17:45.530
And this is just that playing games and this should not be allowed.

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.690
Nobody should criticize Sahaja Yogis which is a group.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:55.770
One individual Sahaja Yogi is doing wrong, I will know.

00:17:55.930 --> 00:18:01.450
So, it is very important that you should be accepted by the group.

00:18:01.650 --> 00:18:04.450
If you are an individual and think you are a great personality

00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.130
and you are trying to correct others,

00:18:07.970 --> 00:18:10.690
and say that the Sahaja Yogis are bad and the ashram is bad

00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:12.490
and do like that

00:18:13.610 --> 00:18:17.450
then you must know you are getting out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:17.770 --> 00:18:23.850
Very soon you will be out. So, one should not try these things

00:18:24.050 --> 00:18:26.450
and taking sides with newcomers.

00:18:26.610 --> 00:18:29.450
When the newcomers are coming you are more attached to the newcomers

00:18:29.530 --> 00:18:33.530
than to the Sahaja Yogis, then be sure you are not there.

00:18:34.770 --> 00:18:36.730
That’s one of the ways you can judge.

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:42.450
Are you with the collectivity or are you trying to get out of it

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.450
and trying to control all the rest?

00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:50.450
All right, this is one of the ways of understanding yourself.

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:54.850
All such tricks will put you out of Sahaja Yoga

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:01.170
and I think this is what Pluto is working out now.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:04.450
So, we should be very careful. It’s nice to celebrate,

00:19:04.530 --> 00:19:06.730
but spirituality is purity.

00:19:06.890 --> 00:19:10.450
If your heart is not pure, you'll be thrown out.

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:21.130
Pluto is purity and purity has one quality that it is very joy-giving.

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:25.450
It's glorious to be pure to be innocent

00:19:25.530 --> 00:19:30.450
but it also means that many things have to be dropped out

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:34.690
and those who don’t drop out will be dropped out with those things.

00:19:35.050 --> 00:19:39.450
So, I want to warn you that it’s a very good day that I started today.

00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:44.170
But this is the problem we'll be facing now so be very careful,

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:49.770
don’t play games with Sahaja Yoga. Clean your heart.

00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:53.650
This is from few people I know who are doing these things.

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:56.450
I know about every one of them.

00:19:56.890 --> 00:20:02.450
So those who are against collectivity will be immediately dropped out.

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:07.450
And then even if they want to come back, they cannot.

00:20:07.850 --> 00:20:10.690
So, try to be one with the group.

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:16.170
Try to have better friendship, better relationships, better brotherhood,

00:20:16.530 --> 00:20:20.810
greater love, greater affection, complete understanding.

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:24.770
Enjoy each other. That’s the best way.

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:28.530
Sahaja Yogis should enjoy each other not the others.

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:33.770
Others are others till they come to us.

00:20:34.450 --> 00:20:39.650
Remember that. In the eyes of God, others are others.

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.970
Sahaja Yogis are his people.

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:47.930
Others are not important at all at all at all.

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.090
If they come well and good.

00:20:50.250 --> 00:20:52.250
Of course, one should not be harsh with them,

00:20:52.570 --> 00:20:55.210
be kindly, be nice, bring them along.

00:20:56.450 --> 00:20:59.970
But in a group, you are to be one.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:02.450
Then there shouldn’t be no differentiation.

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.810
I mean that is one of the qualities the English had once upon a time.

00:21:07.170 --> 00:21:10.810
When Calais was invaded, you know at the time of Queen Elizabeth.

00:21:11.130 --> 00:21:15.130
The Catholics and the Roman, the Catholics and the protestants

00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:20.170
all joined together forgetting their differences.

00:21:21.130 --> 00:21:26.450
I hope you remember those good qualities of the English also.

00:21:27.050 --> 00:21:29.450
And that’s what one has to understand that

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:35.450
when we are facing others, we are all one.

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:40.450
And this is I am telling you again that unity is extremely important

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.450
for the strength of Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:46.530
Those who try to correct the Sahaja Yogis all the time

00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:51.450
are really trying to play into the hands of satan.

00:21:51.970 --> 00:21:59.890
They are doing no good to Sahaja Yoga. Be careful of such people.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:04.530
They will be thrown away. They'll lose their vibrations.

00:22:04.690 --> 00:22:06.570
And you'll find them out.

00:22:06.770 --> 00:22:11.850
So, Sahaja Yoga as it is a very great force of getting people together

00:22:12.010 --> 00:22:14.530
Also, there is this force which is working which is throwing out.

00:22:14.730 --> 00:22:19.930
Because here only those who will improve will become higher and higher,

00:22:20.090 --> 00:22:24.450
will be acceptable, there is no other criteria you know that.

00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:29.770
Those who become purer and purer are accepted as Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.450
You are all Sahaja Yogis here sitting down

00:22:32.810 --> 00:22:38.170
but all of you have to become better and better and better.

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:43.450
The first thing that will happen that you'll be clear-headed.

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:48.450
What I find is that tamo gunis have no clear head.

00:22:49.170 --> 00:22:53.010
First thing, I call somebody X, "Mr. X come along",

00:22:53.530 --> 00:22:57.010
or a lady comes to me, the first reaction is

00:22:57.210 --> 00:23:00.170
puts up her head like that, with a barrier, you see.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:07.090
Say, now I'll say that this carpet is to be say cleaned up.

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:12.450
"What? Which one? Where?"

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:18.770
I said this carpet is to be cleaned. (Sahaja Yogis laugh).

00:23:23.530 --> 00:23:27.450
The another question start. You go on telling ten answers

00:23:27.530 --> 00:23:33.450
but nothing goes, there is a barrier. Nothing goes in that.

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:37.450
They just don’t understand.

00:23:37.530 --> 00:23:40.170
Now how to explain anything to such people.

00:23:40.490 --> 00:23:42.450
There's no clear head in there.

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:44.770
The whole head is clouded you see

00:23:44.930 --> 00:23:48.450
with a barrier which doesn’t want to take anything.

00:23:49.050 --> 00:23:52.850
So, all my lectures are nothing but a sing-song, I think.

00:23:53.010 --> 00:23:58.010
Nothing goes in their head. So, first of all the purity of heart.

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:04.010
You know that the heart has got seven chakras, around it,

00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:08.090
the seven auras and when the heart is clean the light is clean.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:10.970
The Sahastrara becomes clean, absolutely.

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:15.170
First is that, complete dedication of the heart should be there.

00:24:15.530 --> 00:24:19.970
That I’m going to be perfectly all right

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:23.450
and I'm going to be an ideal Sahaja Yogi,

00:24:23.970 --> 00:24:27.450
It is my responsibility.

00:24:27.890 --> 00:24:34.050
Then all this will go away because this muddled head business.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:43.770
I think they hear 50%, 25% they forget and 25% is lost.

00:24:44.090 --> 00:24:48.450
So, what do they understand what I talk?

00:24:49.450 --> 00:24:55.610
So, this kind of barrier is a fashion also; is a fashion.

00:24:55.770 --> 00:24:59.970
I have noticed it's a fashion, in this country specially

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:02.930
because if you tell them something, there is no need,

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:07.010
but first they will repeat my question, "This is the question."

00:25:07.650 --> 00:25:10.690
I say, "What is your name?" "You said what is my name?"

00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:13.450
I said, yes. What is your name? (Sahaja Yogis Laugh).

00:25:14.210 --> 00:25:18.930
Oh! Do you mean, I didn’t understand.

00:25:19.250 --> 00:25:26.010
Oh! I said what’s your name? They'll go on like that.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:29.770
And by that they think they are being very sophisticated.

00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:32.770
Is a new English style, I think.

00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:35.530
Some French have nonsensical ideas about sophisticated

00:25:35.690 --> 00:25:38.170
but English sophistication I can’t understand.

00:25:38.530 --> 00:25:40.050
What this sophistication is?

00:25:40.530 --> 00:25:44.850
Then while talking they will say ten times Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:25:45.250 --> 00:25:47.090
I can’t understand. Why?

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:50.930
Why can’t you speak straightforward thing what is to be said.

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:53.450
Now you must train up. Imagine,

00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:59.050
a Sahaja Yogi standing up to give a lecture with many Ah! Ah! Ah!

00:25:59.530 --> 00:26:03.450
Then they'll think are they saying some mantras or what?

00:26:07.530 --> 00:26:10.530
So, one has to understand in Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:10.690 --> 00:26:15.570
you have to become very dignified, decent, pure people.

00:26:15.770 --> 00:26:21.850
The purity is the point we have to say. Now, out of say hundred,

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:26.930
even if twenty are like that, muddled-headed,

00:26:27.170 --> 00:26:29.770
it creates a bad impression.

00:26:31.770 --> 00:26:36.450
What will others think that these muddle-headed people.

00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:39.090
What are they going to do? How are they saints?

00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:43.530
I mean imagine a saint like this. You are saints no doubt.

00:26:43.690 --> 00:26:46.450
But little saint, no saint, saint, saint, no saint.

00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:49.530
It is like that (Shree Mataji and Sahaja Yogis laugh).

00:26:51.170 --> 00:26:55.530
So important for 20% people it is

00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:00.530
not to blame any bhoots anymore and play about, but try.

00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:04.450
Get your heads cleared out by your heart being cleared,

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:08.450
your head will be cleared. It’s only through your heart,

00:27:08.530 --> 00:27:13.970
you will get a clear idea as to be what is to be done

00:27:15.770 --> 00:27:17.810
and the innocence.

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:24.050
If you start respecting others, other things, innocence will come.

00:27:27.730 --> 00:27:31.770
That innocence only comes through respect; people don’t know.

00:27:32.170 --> 00:27:34.650
So many said, "Mother how to get back purity?"

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:39.570
Get back our innocence is simple, respect yourself.

00:27:39.810 --> 00:27:44.090
Your chastity you respect first. Respect your chastity.

00:27:45.450 --> 00:27:48.690
Respect others' chastity.

00:27:50.650 --> 00:27:55.450
Then others' things, others' relationships.

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:59.130
Respect your relationship with others.

00:27:59.650 --> 00:28:03.450
He's a Sahaja Yogi, you are a Sahaja Yogi, he's a saint, I'm a saint.

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:11.690
I have to respect and then see the joy and the love.

00:28:13.770 --> 00:28:17.650
This muddle-headedness has brought also another problem is today

00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.850
that the bank, my bank was very angry you see

00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:24.450
because I don’t know how you people reach there

00:28:24.530 --> 00:28:29.170
with a cash money or something. They had to pay.

00:28:30.730 --> 00:28:32.970
That should not have been done.

00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:39.090
Is a simple thing is that you have to buy a dollar thing and pay it there.

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:43.450
And the bank people couldn’t understand how Geeta have relationships

00:28:43.530 --> 00:28:48.450
with such mad people and they called them strange also.

00:28:48.890 --> 00:28:51.530
For the simple thing was to make it into dollar,

00:28:51.690 --> 00:28:53.770
it would have cost two pounds more.

00:28:54.130 --> 00:28:59.450
But that’s another thing that a money-saving device is also.

00:28:59.850 --> 00:29:05.050
They are quite experts. Immediately, if I tell somebody now,

00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:10.650
"You go and get so much of say paint", say,

00:29:10.810 --> 00:29:13.490
paint is an example I'm just giving.

00:29:13.650 --> 00:29:16.730
So, they'll say there was a tin available, they'll come back.

00:29:17.170 --> 00:29:20.450
But that tin was so much and this tin was so much.

00:29:20.530 --> 00:29:23.450
I said: "What's that, bring the big tin." "No, but

00:29:23.530 --> 00:29:26.690
this one we can return if it is finished and that one we cannot."

00:29:26.850 --> 00:29:30.450
Say "now bring the big tin". Now, what does it matter, you see,

00:29:30.530 --> 00:29:33.890
in a paint in a house like this, such a huge thing.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:38.450
A little paint more or, but so much of understanding you see,

00:29:38.530 --> 00:29:43.450
how much you can save in that, how much, I mean save pound is another,

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:47.450
everything blowing in our head to "Save pounds!" you see,

00:29:47.530 --> 00:29:49.450
being it any advertisement, "Save pounds!"

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:52.170
Means spending pounds you really save pounds.

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:54.770
You don’t understand the trick but you all the time think,

00:29:54.970 --> 00:29:59.170
what is the saving. Where can we save? Where can we cut?

00:29:59.530 --> 00:30:05.610
This is a waste of energy, completely. Just waste of energy.

00:30:05.890 --> 00:30:08.650
If you go on thinking like that, you'll go mad I think

00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:11.570
because Sahaja Yogis cannot do that.

00:30:12.210 --> 00:30:15.530
You will see that money comes very easy to people

00:30:15.850 --> 00:30:18.010
if you are relaxed about money.

00:30:18.170 --> 00:30:20.650
But if you try to save money, you'll never save

00:30:20.810 --> 00:30:24.210
and that’s why in England, people cannot save pounds

00:30:24.730 --> 00:30:27.450
because they just see the advertisements.

00:30:28.050 --> 00:30:32.450
Any advertisement like that "Save pounds", must be avoided, completely.

00:30:36.810 --> 00:30:40.450
In Sahaja Yoga, we have to believe that God looks after.

00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.450
It is he who is going to do things for us.

00:30:43.690 --> 00:30:46.770
If you put your attention to saving money

00:30:46.970 --> 00:30:51.010
then God doesn’t bother about saving your money.

00:30:52.210 --> 00:30:56.170
You know that miracles have happened about money for so many people.

00:30:56.930 --> 00:31:01.530
Like I went to Patrick’s place I will tell you, Patrick, you see,

00:31:01.690 --> 00:31:05.450
I ask him, "Patrick, you never received any money". He said, "no Mother".

00:31:05.530 --> 00:31:10.530
I said, "don’t tell me lies. Did you receive any money?" He said, "No Mother".

00:31:10.770 --> 00:31:13.450
I said, "Are you sure you haven’t received any money?"

00:31:13.530 --> 00:31:15.450
Then he came out with the truth, "Yes,

00:31:15.530 --> 00:31:21.450
I found thousand dollars, kept on my table one time."

00:31:25.530 --> 00:31:28.450
But that was I thought that should be a good beginning for him to see

00:31:28.530 --> 00:31:33.450
but he went around, the other way around he thought that "Oh God,

00:31:33.530 --> 00:31:35.450
mother loves me so much and she thinks too much of me.

00:31:35.530 --> 00:31:40.090
So now I can go ahead." He started going like a,

00:31:40.530 --> 00:31:45.170
I don't know what should I compare him to, a bull or what?

00:31:45.530 --> 00:31:50.450
Just he became a big great man, a big great leader, everything,

00:31:50.530 --> 00:31:54.450
he got bloated up, you see. He started driving like a balloon rises,

00:31:54.530 --> 00:31:58.010
you see, in the air. Like that it happened.

00:31:58.970 --> 00:32:02.530
But if you have depth, and if you have your dharma,

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:06.090
and if you have Ganesha with you, then you go deep.

00:32:06.250 --> 00:32:10.250
"Oh! Mother has done this. What a miracle! How she has achieved it?

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:17.050
Who is she? How did she do? She looked after us so well." Go down.

00:32:17.530 --> 00:32:20.530
Don’t float in the air like a balloon.

00:32:22.490 --> 00:32:26.450
So, this is what one has to understand.

00:32:26.530 --> 00:32:31.450
This is another conditioning we have of saving money, saving money.

00:32:31.530 --> 00:32:35.130
Let’s save here, let’s save there. Ultimately, what you find,

00:32:35.450 --> 00:32:41.050
no money to go to India. Last minute, borrow from here,

00:32:41.210 --> 00:32:44.450
borrow from there, go to the thing get it.

00:32:48.090 --> 00:32:52.570
So trust in God. God will look after you.

00:32:52.770 --> 00:32:58.810
You have to have trust, trust in others, trust in everything.
in others, trust in eve I trust you. I always trust you.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.490
Beyond, any trusting that is possible, for everything.

00:33:02.650 --> 00:33:08.450
Today only somebody came who was here,

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:11.450
he told me that 25% prices have risen up in India.

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:16.890
But I think the amount nowadays is how much it is.

00:33:17.530 --> 00:33:21.450
A Sahaja Yogi says: "25 dollars, 5%" That is how much it is.

00:33:21.530 --> 00:33:26.530
5% money have raised.

00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:28.130
So, Warren was rather worried, mother how will you manage now with 5%.

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:32.450
I said, "I’ll manage", a vow of trust, I have trust that I can do it.

00:33:32.530 --> 00:33:39.450
I can trust myself and I can trust you.

00:33:39.530 --> 00:33:42.970
So, this is important that you have to trust each other.

00:33:43.610 --> 00:33:47.450
First of all, you trust yourself and trust others.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:51.450
By trust only you can work out wonders.

00:33:51.610 --> 00:33:55.450
If you don’t trust people, doubt everyone, you cannot work out.

00:33:55.530 --> 00:34:00.090
It makes the whole organization very, very fickle.

00:34:00.250 --> 00:34:05.450
So try to trust each other. I know there could be a wrong person.

00:34:06.010 --> 00:34:11.850
I'll take that person out. I know who it is.

00:34:12.170 --> 00:34:14.770
You just don’t worry but you try to trust and don’t worry

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:19.770
as to what is going to happen.

00:34:20.170 --> 00:34:22.450
Trust yourself and trust the God Almighty,

00:34:22.530 --> 00:34:28.450
because he's the one who is going to look after us,

00:34:29.010 --> 00:34:31.770
yoga kshema vahami. If you have the yoga, you will get the kshema.

00:34:31.970 --> 00:34:36.810
Yoga must be established so you get the kshema.

00:34:37.130 --> 00:34:39.770
Second part of it is not first, the first is Yoga, establish to your yoga

00:34:40.290 --> 00:34:47.090
and then you will be amazed how things work out.

00:34:47.290 --> 00:34:51.450
And so many people asked me that,

00:34:52.370 --> 00:34:54.610
"Mother why only in England this problem is this."

00:34:54.810 --> 00:34:58.450
There is unemployment all over the world.

00:34:58.530 --> 00:35:00.690
There is problem everywhere,

00:35:00.890 --> 00:35:03.450
but the last minute is business of going to Coutts. Imagine,

00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:08.530
Coutts is in England, England. While we have got money already paid,

00:35:08.730 --> 00:35:14.570
even from Vancouver and from Australia, all paid long time back,

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:21.050
while the English people were today queueing up in Coutts & company.

00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:25.170
And the Coutts & company became mad

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:28.610
and they said "What sort of thing it is, Mother?

00:35:28.850 --> 00:35:30.650
We don’t want to have your accounts."

00:35:30.850 --> 00:35:33.690
So, what is the reason for that, that we have not trusted ourselves,

00:35:37.410 --> 00:35:42.450
we have not trusted others. Some people told me, that

00:35:42.530 --> 00:35:45.330
they made a mistake, they forgot about it, how can it be?

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:50.450
So, this messy nature must go away, we have to do it systematically.

00:35:51.170 --> 00:35:55.690
We have to be systematic about Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:35:58.450
As you have now started meditating in the morning time

00:35:58.730 --> 00:36:01.970
and doing all those things. I am sure the system will work out.

00:36:02.250 --> 00:36:05.730
The system of God should be there. And it so automatically works out.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:11.330
In three days, we have planned such a big, huge ashram, in three days.

00:36:12.610 --> 00:36:17.210
I mean, in one day I planned of course,

00:36:18.050 --> 00:36:20.130
but in two days we've drawn it and finished.

00:36:20.330 --> 00:36:22.610
Two days you took. Two days. Such a huge plan.

00:36:22.810 --> 00:36:27.530
You can’t imagine, if you see it. Have you got it with you?

00:36:27.730 --> 00:36:31.330
You haven’t got it, otherwise we'd have shown you.

00:36:31.530 --> 00:36:34.210
With four floors and very beautiful architecture and great design,

00:36:34.450 --> 00:36:40.130
facade, six floors in 4 floors

00:36:40.330 --> 00:36:45.370
and a beautiful place and everything organized.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:51.090
So how? I mean, I am not an architect, I am nothing of the kind

00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:55.890
but it was all done. In the same way, you can all have those powers.

00:36:56.090 --> 00:37:01.770
You have to just assume that you are saints.

00:37:02.170 --> 00:37:05.250
You must know you are saints and behold the way you are a saint,

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:14.170
accordingly, it should behold your position

00:37:14.410 --> 00:37:20.770
as a saint, to live like saints, to behave like saints.

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:25.770
It is not just what ways you put up or features you put up

00:37:25.970 --> 00:37:29.450
but the temperamentally, the generosity,

00:37:29.530 --> 00:37:33.010
the kindness, the compassion, the love, the nourishment,

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:36.450
that you have to give to each other and to the whole world.

00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:40.170
If you cannot give it to Sahaja Yogis, you cannot give it to anyone.

00:37:40.370 --> 00:37:44.450
The first test is how far you love each other in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:44.650 --> 00:37:48.450
It’s nice to see all of you here today on this great occasion.

00:37:49.290 --> 00:37:55.010
Also, I feel sad that I have to leave you now.

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:57.690
I am going to India and I am going to meet you there, all of you.

00:37:58.250 --> 00:38:02.450
I hope so many of you are coming down.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.450
Now, to India when you are coming also come with a deeper enquiry.

00:38:05.850 --> 00:38:15.450
Because, superficially if you see, that country doesn’t have your comforts,

00:38:16.730 --> 00:38:21.450
doesn’t have this paper, you know,

00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:23.450
may not have carpets but it has got a heart.

00:38:23.530 --> 00:38:29.450
They have got a heart.

00:38:29.530 --> 00:38:32.250
A very large heart and whatever they do they do it from their heart.

00:38:32.490 --> 00:38:38.450
If somebody is very superficial can even ridicule them for their sincerity,

00:38:39.450 --> 00:38:43.450
can even make fun of them that they are so stupid to be that sincere.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:47.450
I mean, according to modern ideas.

00:38:47.890 --> 00:38:50.450
But you have to develop that heart.

00:38:51.370 --> 00:38:54.450
A simple innocent giving heart,

00:38:55.530 --> 00:38:58.730
which enjoys, which has the fondness to do.

00:38:58.930 --> 00:39:01.090
I mean I had to tell them now, argument is the other way around.

00:39:01.290 --> 00:39:04.450
You will be amazed if I tell you the arguments were,

00:39:04.530 --> 00:39:06.770
like when Modi came here and he said we want them to stay in Bombay

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:11.330
but I said why? Bombay is an expensive place. No Mother,

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:14.130
we will bear half the expenses but let them stay there.

00:39:14.330 --> 00:39:16.890
Why, you see that’s what we want?

00:39:17.170 --> 00:39:18.850
I mean the whole thing was argument, you remember?

00:39:19.050 --> 00:39:21.090
We want to do something for them, they are coming to our country now.

00:39:21.290 --> 00:39:24.610
We want to make some nice things you see,

00:39:24.810 --> 00:39:26.450
we will make some nice food for them.

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.450
I said, don’t make over do, simple food should do. No, no Mother,

00:39:28.530 --> 00:39:31.450
but that’s the only chance we have got.

00:39:31.530 --> 00:39:35.450
And the whole argument was how they will afford.

00:39:35.930 --> 00:39:38.450
Then they said we should have,

00:39:38.530 --> 00:39:41.450
I said have just five days, in that place where, Bordi,

00:39:41.530 --> 00:39:47.210
So, I said at least make it seven days mother,

00:39:47.410 --> 00:39:50.850
please seven days because that will be easier,

00:39:51.050 --> 00:39:53.450
poor things will be coming and then they would like to sleep for one day,

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:57.450
after all they would be tired, so one day is gone,

00:39:57.530 --> 00:40:00.450
two days like this and the other group will be coming so you see

00:40:00.530 --> 00:40:04.250
they are just thinking how to make you comfortable,

00:40:04.450 --> 00:40:06.490
how make you happy, what to feed you, what to do.

00:40:06.690 --> 00:40:11.450
But if you want to see something superficial

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:13.970
you might try to find some faults.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.370
And I have seen, people spoil, people spoil.

00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:24.330
They really, they spoiled so many Sahaja Yogis by their overdoing

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.850
which was never understood why they did it.

00:40:29.050 --> 00:40:32.450
Now gradually you are understanding.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:36.290
You have to become that kind of a personality that gives that nourishes.

00:40:36.530 --> 00:40:43.930
That is fond of doing for others. What should I do?

00:40:45.530 --> 00:40:50.450
What should I buy for you? What should I get for you?

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:54.450
You see, it’s such a joy. You see, my special joy is in that.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:58.450
I mean, in America, I was at least 25% of time

00:40:58.650 --> 00:41:02.330
I was busy buying things because I have to give presents

00:41:02.570 --> 00:41:04.890
and they said, "Mother what are you doing?"

00:41:05.090 --> 00:41:06.450
I said, "I enjoy, just forget it."

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.450
If had time this time I would have bought something for you people before going.

00:41:10.330 --> 00:41:15.250
Just I enjoyed that’s what, just enjoy giving.

00:41:15.450 --> 00:41:19.410
I wish, you could just jump on the other side,

00:41:19.850 --> 00:41:22.450
other bank of this river and see the joy of giving is so great,

00:41:22.530 --> 00:41:28.850
is much greater than getting anything for yourself.

00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:32.450
And with this idea you should go and see how they enjoy.

00:41:32.650 --> 00:41:36.450
If I tell them, a lady was there,

00:41:37.410 --> 00:41:39.450
she said that you must come and have breakfast with us.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:42.450
I said, "I have at least forty people with me,

00:41:42.530 --> 00:41:46.450
how can I come to your house?"

00:41:46.530 --> 00:41:49.450
She said, "No, we will arrange, don't you worry."

00:41:49.770 --> 00:41:52.450
So, all the neighbors you see, got up at four o’clock,

00:41:52.530 --> 00:41:54.450
prepared all the breakfast for us. Everything ready,

00:41:54.530 --> 00:41:57.450
when we went that was so beautifully organized

00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:59.450
and those people who were with us coming,

00:41:59.530 --> 00:42:05.450
you were there I think that time. He is here. He is outside.

00:42:06.090 --> 00:42:09.090
So, the first group, I think the second group was there.

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:12.250
Gavin you remember that lady who, "I came the day after that."

00:42:12.490 --> 00:42:15.050
Day after that? You missed the point.

00:42:16.530 --> 00:42:20.170
"I know the story" Isn’t it? Just imagine and they were so happy,

00:42:20.370 --> 00:42:23.450
and they were so happy feeding and giving,

00:42:23.530 --> 00:42:25.450
and all of them were running and you will see this.

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:31.450
You will see yourself and they never tell me any problems,

00:42:31.770 --> 00:42:34.690
always solutions. They are there with the solutions.

00:42:35.050 --> 00:42:38.450
You tell them now the problem is, you see, they want to go by a bus.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:41.410
We can’t afford to keep the buses for long time. No,

00:42:41.610 --> 00:42:44.450
that’s all right, we will get you buses. They will take you down.

00:42:44.530 --> 00:42:48.450
You don’t worry. Now we have this problem, what to do?

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.250
Don’t worry, we will manage Mother. We will get it.

00:42:51.450 --> 00:42:54.450
All the time they are giving solutions to me but here,

00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:57.450
it’s the other way around, the problems.

00:42:57.690 --> 00:43:03.890
The problems, the sentence starts with, "Now today is a disaster."

00:43:04.410 --> 00:43:09.050
"What’s the disaster?" "The milkman has not come."

00:43:14.690 --> 00:43:18.050
Always something starts with the problem.

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:20.450
Now, have you any solutions?

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:22.650
Have we any solutions?

00:43:22.850 --> 00:43:26.450
Only the persons who can think of solutions can construct.

00:43:26.850 --> 00:43:31.450
So, remember that is very common and I get really frustrated.

00:43:31.530 --> 00:43:34.450
Sometimes, I really get irritated.

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:38.450
Everybody has some problems or some problems, some problems

00:43:39.599 --> 00:43:45.450
and even if you give a solution, "BUT", "But what?'

00:43:45.530 --> 00:43:49.450
I am giving a solution. But it could be that, it could be this,

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:55.650
but why don’t you find out. I mean they know all about it.

00:43:55.857 --> 00:43:57.777
Supposing you say, "Let’s go by this road",

00:43:57.970 --> 00:44:00.450
"But there could be a traffic."

00:44:00.530 --> 00:44:04.050
I said, "How do you know sitting down here?"

00:44:05.530 --> 00:44:08.450
But at this time this is this.

00:44:08.530 --> 00:44:15.530
Everybody is so knowledgeable with the ideas how to create problems

00:44:15.730 --> 00:44:20.210
and never solutions. Such a knowledge is useless, I think.

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:23.730
Such useless knowledge you must throw in the sea.

00:44:24.410 --> 00:44:27.850
Not very near Brighton because we are having solutions there.

00:44:35.530 --> 00:44:39.450
So, don’t create problems, don’t create problems.

00:44:39.650 --> 00:44:42.930
That’s very important is not to have any problems.

00:44:43.210 --> 00:44:46.850
Try to find out solutions and give solutions.

00:44:47.050 --> 00:44:50.970
So, this language should be changed, "The problem is..."

00:44:51.330 --> 00:44:54.450
This language we are going to change from today.

00:44:55.130 --> 00:44:58.570
And you will be surprised all problems can be solved like that.

00:44:58.970 --> 00:45:02.090
Only change your direction.

00:45:02.410 --> 00:45:06.530
Supposing you are straight forward marching towards problems.

00:45:06.930 --> 00:45:10.330
Now what can you do, I mean, even if you are a Sahaja Yogi, no use,

00:45:10.530 --> 00:45:14.410
I mean you are going towards it but just turn your face

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:18.050
from the problems, no problem.

00:45:18.650 --> 00:45:23.210
Believe me, there should be no problems for you.

00:45:25.530 --> 00:45:29.050
Have you noticed that happening?

00:45:30.930 --> 00:45:35.610
Then, last of all is to remember,

00:45:35.970 --> 00:45:39.730
that you must understand your Mother very well

00:45:42.090 --> 00:45:46.330
and do not jump into conclusions of your own

00:45:48.850 --> 00:45:51.770
and if you start jumping onto your own conclusions,

00:45:51.970 --> 00:45:54.450
you really create problems.

00:45:54.530 --> 00:46:00.930
Firstly, we must know that Sahaja Yoga, we cannot make any money out of it.

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:06.210
There cannot be any commercial activity on Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:08.970 --> 00:46:13.450
As it is, I am hopelessly bad as far as money is concerned.

00:46:14.530 --> 00:46:17.450
You ask him, he will tell you those who have known me know that.

00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.450
I am hopelessly bad.

00:46:19.530 --> 00:46:23.930
I don’t know even how to sign a cheque even today I don’t know.

00:46:24.130 --> 00:46:26.450
When will I learn I don’t know may be

00:46:26.530 --> 00:46:29.170
because this is entering into the sixth house,

00:46:29.370 --> 00:46:31.450
I will be even worse now.

00:46:32.010 --> 00:46:36.530
So, first of all we are not going to have any time

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:39.450
any kind of commercial activity

00:46:39.530 --> 00:46:46.010
and if you ever try it, I will see to it that you get depleted completely.

00:46:46.330 --> 00:46:49.930
So, no commercial activity for Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:50.370 --> 00:46:55.450
No commercial thing should be started in the name of Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:56.170 --> 00:47:04.330
Like I have seen somebody Nirmala Udyog in India means Nirmala enterprise.

00:47:05.370 --> 00:47:07.890
I mean this is not the way, this is not allowed.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:15.410
Or Sahaja Udyog we cannot do that. It’s all right Sahaja Yoga co-op,

00:47:15.650 --> 00:47:17.690
because Sahaja Yogis are there in cooperative

00:47:17.890 --> 00:47:21.450
but should not be a money-making proposition anywhere,

00:47:21.530 --> 00:47:24.770
any business, anything, don’t use the name of Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:25.090 --> 00:47:29.770
It will be spoiling it. It won’t be good.

00:47:30.170 --> 00:47:34.050
So, you must understand, that should not be done.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:38.490
Secondly, your Mother is an extremely practical woman,

00:47:39.010 --> 00:47:41.450
extremely practical.

00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:46.450
So, do not start thinking. You see, people get an idea.

00:47:46.530 --> 00:47:50.450
Just now we had one example of that.

00:47:51.330 --> 00:47:56.450
That somebody said that I want to keep [...].

00:47:56.530 --> 00:48:02.730
I mean, this is something even if I wear a hat, I don’t think like that.

00:48:04.530 --> 00:48:07.650
Because I don’t know how people jump into conclusions

00:48:07.850 --> 00:48:09.530
and they will say Mother said.

00:48:09.930 --> 00:48:13.010
This is another way of doing it.

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:16.450
You must do the things that are practical.

00:48:16.530 --> 00:48:18.970
When I say that you should not try to save money

00:48:19.170 --> 00:48:21.570
doesn’t mean that you waste your money.

00:48:21.890 --> 00:48:27.370
So, one has to be very, very practical and pragmatic

00:48:27.650 --> 00:48:29.570
and that happens because you see,

00:48:29.770 --> 00:48:33.450
spirituality is the most practical thing. Sahaja Yoga,

00:48:33.530 --> 00:48:37.850
have you seen anything more practical than Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:39.130 --> 00:48:42.450
It’s the most practical thing but that doesn’t mean

00:48:42.530 --> 00:48:45.850
that you go to the bank and start seeing vibrations there,

00:48:46.050 --> 00:48:49.450
standing on Oxford street seeing the vibrations there.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:55.650
Seeing the vibrations of the balloon. This is stupid.

00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:12.450
Or I mean, this should not be done outside. I mean, Muslims also,

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:16.290
when they do namaz, they look quite odd to me

00:49:16.490 --> 00:49:18.450
that standing on the street sometimes,

00:49:18.530 --> 00:49:21.450
and suddenly you will find a Muslim see spreading something

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:31.450
and going up like that. It’s stupid. It's show off. It's a sacred thing.

00:49:32.210 --> 00:49:35.450
In the road I have seen people walking like this.

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:40.450
I mean what is this, people will think you are mad or what.

00:49:41.570 --> 00:49:46.130
So, we have to be extremely decent people

00:49:46.330 --> 00:49:50.530
and understanding in what atmosphere we live.

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:53.530
They don’t talk our language, they don’t understand us.

00:49:53.850 --> 00:49:59.450
So, we should not be ridiculous, we'll look like punk rocks.

00:50:07.530 --> 00:50:15.530
So, we have to be very decent, very poised people,

00:50:16.530 --> 00:50:24.530
affectionate, compassionate, soft spoken, sweet, kindly, and alert.

00:50:26.450 --> 00:50:30.450
Or we put the alert first.

00:50:32.290 --> 00:50:34.410
That way we have to be.

00:50:34.850 --> 00:50:38.450
I am telling you because the new year is now coming

00:50:38.770 --> 00:50:42.010
and in new year what you have to do

00:50:42.290 --> 00:50:44.850
is to give up all that is nonsensical

00:50:45.090 --> 00:50:47.330
and think of all that is good

00:50:47.650 --> 00:50:52.930
and that’s why we have to see what’s wrong with us.

00:50:53.290 --> 00:50:58.570
Now the last of all is that never get stuck on to any place.

00:50:58.930 --> 00:51:01.450
That’s the best way to live in this world.

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:07.130
Live like a traveler. In this short life of mine, whatever it is,

00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:11.450
in these forty-five years or forty years of my married life,

00:51:11.530 --> 00:51:16.770
not yet forty I think it’s thirty-eight, we have changed about forty houses.

00:51:17.330 --> 00:51:21.450
I like it. Because it is sticking to any place.

00:51:22.170 --> 00:51:25.450
Now I have seen people get stuck to Surbiton now.

00:51:25.530 --> 00:51:30.450
Stuck, they get stuck to Chelsham Road.

00:51:30.530 --> 00:51:33.450
As soon as you get a feeling that you are getting stuck,

00:51:33.530 --> 00:51:38.450
leave that place and get out of there. Then this is my house,

00:51:38.530 --> 00:51:41.690
then this is my Surbiton, then that is my Chelsham Road.

00:51:42.130 --> 00:51:45.450
That’s not a sign of a saint. A saint is a traveler throughout,

00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:49.450
he doesn’t stick to anything.

00:51:49.930 --> 00:51:52.450
Now, how to sell this house, I will tell you tomorrow.

00:51:52.530 --> 00:51:56.450
At least, we need that, what we have done about it.

00:51:56.530 --> 00:52:00.450
There is no stickiness about it.

00:52:00.850 --> 00:52:05.290
Then the fight starts, then "Surbiton is my house.

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:07.450
How dare you come here?"

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:10.330
You are like this. "Chelsham Road is my house.

00:52:10.530 --> 00:52:15.890
I must do this thing for that." That’s how you get localized,

00:52:16.210 --> 00:52:21.050
you become malignant, no connection with the whole.

00:52:21.330 --> 00:52:25.450
This is just like a

00:52:28.530 --> 00:52:47.330
serai, a place where caravans go and settle down, caravanserai

00:52:47.530 --> 00:52:52.170
Like an inn. It’s an inn. It’s like an inn itself.

00:52:52.370 --> 00:52:56.450
You live in an inn, live there like an inn and then

00:52:56.650 --> 00:53:00.450
you have to go from this inn,

00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:06.450
your house and abode is the kingdom of God.

00:53:07.570 --> 00:53:11.210
There where we exist, there where we live

00:53:11.850 --> 00:53:15.690
and that is always with you, so what does it matter.

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:19.450
These are all superficial things. It’s not important.

00:53:19.650 --> 00:53:22.650
Now because Mother stayed in a particular house

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:26.450
so I have seen people running mad after that. I mean what is it.

00:53:26.530 --> 00:53:29.810
I am sitting here, what is the need to go to the house?

00:53:30.330 --> 00:53:33.450
It’s like I told you the other day, like having my photograph,

00:53:33.530 --> 00:53:38.330
taking vibrations from my photograph and I am giving a lecture here.

00:53:38.650 --> 00:53:45.450
Unduly we are paying attention to things which we should not.

00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:54.090
We should know that we are the temples of the God.

00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:59.450
We are the abode of God that God resides within us.

00:53:59.530 --> 00:54:08.770
The light has come within us. We have to be the beautiful temples of God.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:16.450
The most glorious place is yourself where God resides.

00:54:17.290 --> 00:54:22.450
So, all that is not wanted out of, should be thrown out of this temple

00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:30.210
and make yourself that clean beautiful temple

00:54:31.050 --> 00:54:33.770
where God would like to reside,

00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:41.450
otherwise he will disappear and that is what is Ishvara Pranidhana

00:54:41.690 --> 00:54:47.450
which we should try to maintain, establish and develop.

00:54:47.810 --> 00:54:50.610
And then it grows and grows and grows,

00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:53.450
the temple becomes a palace,

00:54:54.250 --> 00:55:04.170
a huge big place where many can come and enjoy the bliss of your heart.

00:55:04.530 --> 00:55:06.610
Let’s become like that.

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:11.570
So today is a day of a pledge in a way in our hearts to say that

00:55:11.770 --> 00:55:15.450
whatever we do we'll do from our hearts

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:21.450
because we are from the soil of the heart of the universe.

00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:25.450
So, this is a simple thing we have to just ask the Mother earth

00:55:25.530 --> 00:55:28.010
and she will give you the power to do that.

00:55:28.290 --> 00:55:31.450
Once you start becoming there, all this messiness,

00:55:31.530 --> 00:55:39.450
all this unruliness and the unsystematic way,

00:55:39.530 --> 00:55:45.450
all this untidiness about life, everything will disappear

00:55:46.090 --> 00:55:53.450
and there will be clear picture of the London Sahaja Yogis.

00:55:53.970 --> 00:56:02.450
I think I have given the maximum time to you and the least to Australia.

00:56:03.010 --> 00:56:09.170
I must say that they have proved so well.

00:56:09.530 --> 00:56:17.450
They have been so great, never given me a problem, always a solution.

00:56:18.210 --> 00:56:21.170
In the same way, London Sahaja Yogis

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:24.450
should all of them should become people

00:56:24.530 --> 00:56:26.450
who will give solutions and no problem.

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:32.450
So, the ‘but’ has to go away from our English language for Sahaja Yogis.

00:56:33.250 --> 00:56:41.450
So, I would also like to thank Dr. Warren Reeves for all the help

00:56:41.530 --> 00:56:44.450
he has done yet so far, so selflessly, so clear-headedly,

00:56:44.530 --> 00:56:50.450
so well, by settling down here to solve all the problems

00:56:50.650 --> 00:56:54.890
