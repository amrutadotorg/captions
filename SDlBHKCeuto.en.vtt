00:40.530 --> 00:48.450
1983-1121 Pre-Christmas Evening

00:48.530 --> 00:53.170
Sorry for this delay but today there is something great luck for us.

00:53.610 --> 00:55.690
A gentleman has come from Delhi

00:55.850 --> 00:58.610
with the plans of our ashram in Delhi

00:58.810 --> 01:04.450
and within two-three days we could make another plan.

01:04.610 --> 01:08.530
A much better plan for Delhi people

01:08.770 --> 01:13.210
and he came to see us this evening and I had to discuss it with him

01:13.610 --> 01:17.850
and I am sure he'll manage it very well

01:18.130 --> 01:22.210
and he's invited Allen to go to India

01:22.650 --> 01:24.970
and he's going to look after Allen there

01:25.170 --> 01:31.570
and he's going to make him stay in India

01:31.770 --> 01:35.690
where Allen is going to work out the whole thing.

01:35.970 --> 01:39.530
So let’s give a hand to Allen. (Everyone applauds for Allen).

01:50.530 --> 01:53.050
It’s very God sent we must understand again

01:53.210 --> 01:55.130
the Ritambhara Pragya is working out

01:55.730 --> 01:57.850
Let him be seated somewhere.

01:58.130 --> 02:02.090
There's a guest we have, can we give a room somewhere?

02:12.970 --> 02:20.730
So, it was pointed out by Warren

02:20.970 --> 02:25.450
that he'll have to work here for two years,

02:25.530 --> 02:32.450
he cannot practice as an architect and he has to put so much money

02:32.530 --> 02:35.530
to ensure and all kinds of problems are here.

02:35.730 --> 02:39.130
And suddenly today we find somebody who is willing

02:39.450 --> 02:42.450
to take him up in India and send him abroad

02:42.530 --> 02:44.450
and all those things are there.

02:44.530 --> 02:47.490
So you can imagine how things work out for him

02:47.770 --> 02:51.210
but there should be dedication and understanding

02:51.770 --> 02:55.170
about Sahaja Yoga first of all, that’s very important.

02:55.690 --> 02:57.690
Now, today in the beginning of the whole thing

02:57.850 --> 03:03.210
I don’t want to say something that will not make you happy.

03:03.770 --> 03:10.130
Today is a day of great happiness and joy and that we have to know

03:10.810 --> 03:14.970
that Christ came on this earth

03:15.770 --> 03:20.530
to deliver us from our sins and our karmas

03:20.930 --> 03:24.970
and it was such a sacrifice

03:25.770 --> 03:32.770
He went into which we cannot see

03:33.250 --> 03:37.570
or visualize with human understanding.

03:38.130 --> 03:41.530
It was too much for a person who was so powerful

03:41.770 --> 03:46.570
to get into a position where

03:46.690 --> 03:51.450
he had to forget that he was so powerful and go through all that

03:51.970 --> 03:54.730
and treated just like an ordinary person.

03:55.010 --> 03:57.770
It was too much but he did it

03:58.050 --> 04:00.050
just because that drama was to be played

04:00.210 --> 04:03.570
because Agnya Chakra was to be opened out.

04:03.970 --> 04:07.970
But we have to understand that though he has done all that,

04:08.130 --> 04:12.530
our karmas are being taken away as you know that

04:12.810 --> 04:16.930
as soon as the kundalini is awakened, you know that

04:17.090 --> 04:21.530
kundalini cannot be awakened if your karmas aren't clean.

04:22.050 --> 04:24.890
You cannot, that’s why in the olden days

04:25.050 --> 04:28.850
people used to go to Himalayas and all those farfetched places

04:29.010 --> 04:32.930
used to clean their karmas clean their bodies clean everything

04:33.090 --> 04:35.450
and then they used to get awakening of the kundalini,

04:35.610 --> 04:37.570
they used to get realization.

04:37.770 --> 04:40.050
But the way we have got realization thanks to Christ

04:40.210 --> 04:42.530
that Agnya Chakra could be opened out

04:42.690 --> 04:46.450
and that I could manage that.

04:46.610 --> 04:50.770
But we do not realize that once that is done

04:50.970 --> 04:56.170
that means you are now entitled to get your realization

04:56.610 --> 04:58.810
because of your Agnya Chakra being opened out

04:59.090 --> 05:02.970
that your Sahastrara can be opened out.

05:03.170 --> 05:09.850
But, the punishment of the karmas has been taken away.

05:10.490 --> 05:13.810
You have been given such a higher position

05:14.170 --> 05:19.850
that you suddenly become Saints and you get all the knowledge

05:20.010 --> 05:23.170
that Saints cannot have about Sahaja Yoga,

05:23.490 --> 05:26.930
about the Shudha Vidya, the Nirmal Vidya,

05:27.090 --> 05:30.570
you get all the knowledge of the Spirit.

05:31.130 --> 05:40.930
But the problem is I find that we have certain special problems

05:41.090 --> 05:45.170
belonging to the special countries also

05:45.530 --> 05:50.130
and my attention has been on England very much, you know that

05:50.610 --> 05:56.170
and I have really worked here very hard, 10 years I have worked

05:56.850 --> 06:00.170
and for English Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

06:00.490 --> 06:10.450
what are they lacking in just our own understanding of ourselves

06:10.530 --> 06:15.850
which should be done with proper critical eye

06:16.010 --> 06:19.730
so that we understand what is our problem.

06:20.010 --> 06:24.450
Of course, the karmas have been forgiven, you can see that.

06:24.850 --> 06:27.850
No problem of the karmas are there,

06:28.250 --> 06:30.770
but the problem that exists within us

06:30.930 --> 06:35.770
is also little bit from this country itself.

06:36.610 --> 06:40.490
The first is that this is a country of tamo guna

06:40.730 --> 06:43.890
because it is in a very high altitude placed

06:44.050 --> 06:47.090
and it is very cold country

06:47.530 --> 06:52.450
and people are used to drinking and all those things.

06:52.530 --> 06:57.530
So, the generations have done that, so it has gone into more tamo guna

06:57.730 --> 07:00.690
and now it is so saturated that tamo guna.

07:00.850 --> 07:03.970
When once upon a time, it was on the right side,

07:04.130 --> 07:06.010
now it has gone onto the left side

07:06.170 --> 07:10.890
because the whole saturation of that drinking and all those things

07:11.050 --> 07:16.170
have brought this tamo guna to settle down in this country.

07:16.770 --> 07:25.570
So, the first problem is of tamo and tamo guna makes you

07:25.850 --> 07:32.170
with your intelligence explain everything automatically.

07:33.490 --> 07:37.450
So, the intelligence has a capacity to cheat itself.

07:37.850 --> 07:41.010
So, the intelligence tells you – see now, all right

07:41.170 --> 07:45.170
if we have to get up in the morning that maybe all right in India

07:45.530 --> 07:50.450
but in England maybe too much (Sahaja Yogis laugh).

07:50.610 --> 07:53.970
That’s special intelligence

07:54.610 --> 08:00.450
and then you see the progress compared to other people becomes slow,

08:00.930 --> 08:03.970
despite mother is working so hard here.

08:05.050 --> 08:08.890
The second thing is that tamo gunis, you see,

08:09.170 --> 08:12.490
because they have to live with their tamo guna,

08:12.650 --> 08:17.770
they become very shallow and their depth is missing

08:18.250 --> 08:21.450
because they are on the other side of it

08:21.530 --> 08:23.050
and they do not touch their depth

08:23.210 --> 08:25.850
so they can live very superficially you see.

08:26.010 --> 08:29.130
Ah, whatever they do they don’t feel anything.

08:29.450 --> 08:31.810
They are not ashamed of it; they are not touched by it.

08:32.050 --> 08:36.890
Whatever it is, at the most they blame a bhoots of their, that’s all.

08:37.090 --> 08:39.850
But otherwise in a shallow everyone.

08:40.250 --> 08:43.530
They do not touch it that much where they should touch

08:43.730 --> 08:45.930
because of tamo guna.

08:46.170 --> 08:51.090
Now, as it is this is the heart of the Universe

08:52.490 --> 08:57.810
and a person who has a heart is the most deep personality

08:58.770 --> 09:00.810
because you see doing with the heart.

09:01.050 --> 09:04.450
Anything done with the heart means you are all out for it.

09:04.770 --> 09:08.530
So just the other way around it is that sometimes when we are shallow,

09:08.730 --> 09:16.130
there's no heart, nothing, we do something without the heart.

09:16.570 --> 09:21.210
Now, as you have seen in the Ashtanga Yogas,

09:21.610 --> 09:25.770
there is a many a times I have said Ishvara Pranidhana is the first.

09:26.010 --> 09:29.610
Now what is Ishvara Pranidhana, we must understand.

09:30.170 --> 09:37.450
Ishvara Pranidhana is the establishment of God in your heart.

09:38.250 --> 09:40.250
Now, how do you do?

09:40.570 --> 09:46.450
You see, you see a mantra, you are just saying it outwardly.

09:46.730 --> 09:52.090
You are clearing out outwardly. You are meditating outwardly.

09:52.770 --> 09:57.170
But when you are saying that,

09:57.490 --> 10:02.650
you are just using your right side

10:03.770 --> 10:08.810
or your left side but not your heart.

10:09.730 --> 10:12.650
So, what you have to do is to balance it.

10:12.850 --> 10:17.770
When you are saying something, say it with devotion, with dedication,

10:18.130 --> 10:22.650
with understanding and try to put it in your heart that

10:23.170 --> 10:32.970
"Whatever I am saying is a mantra given to me by Adi Shakti herself."

10:33.170 --> 10:36.130
So is a mantra very powerful.

10:36.530 --> 10:38.890
But the mantras also lose their powers

10:39.050 --> 10:41.810
if you do not have the Ishvara Pranidhana.

10:42.170 --> 10:46.450
That means your Ishvara must be established in your heart

10:47.170 --> 10:50.450
and this is what we lack is that when we do something

10:50.530 --> 10:54.450
we just do outwardly in a shallow manner.

10:54.530 --> 10:57.530
And if you are shallow you will be playing with this.

10:57.770 --> 11:00.450
Now playing games is a very common thing with us

11:00.610 --> 11:03.450
because you see people with Tamasa what else will they do.

11:03.610 --> 11:05.770
I mean they are lazy lumps.

11:05.970 --> 11:09.450
So, the mind has to be used. You see, mind doesn’t stop, isn’t it?

11:09.610 --> 11:12.970
It's working all the time and we are lazy, doing nothing.

11:13.210 --> 11:17.450
So, the mind plays on its own and then we should understand that

11:17.530 --> 11:20.450
this mind is the one that makes you shallow.

11:20.610 --> 11:23.970
We make faces as if we are very happy before mother

11:24.130 --> 11:25.450
or something like that

11:25.530 --> 11:28.450
or we say we are very this thing and we have achieved this and that

11:28.530 --> 11:31.450
suppose but she knows.

11:31.530 --> 11:38.850
So, what we have to do is to feel what we want to say,

11:39.570 --> 11:40.450
what we have to do.

11:40.530 --> 11:45.610
That is Ishvara Pranidhana. It should not be superficial.

11:45.770 --> 11:49.930
I have seen people, Oh Mother! This that this that.

11:50.210 --> 11:54.530
Just coming from the lips only sometimes.

11:55.170 --> 11:57.450
It should come from the heart.

11:57.530 --> 12:01.450
Try to feel that. You will see the joy will be much more.

12:01.530 --> 12:05.650
You're trying to give me joy. You try to give yourself that joy.

12:05.810 --> 12:08.650
That’s what you are feeling within your heart.

12:09.090 --> 12:11.770
Try to feel that in your heart.

12:11.970 --> 12:15.050
When the Ishvara Pranidhana is established.

12:15.490 --> 12:20.530
But this is one of the problems is the Tamasa.

12:20.970 --> 12:24.770
But when they were aggressive in this country then their aggression

12:24.930 --> 12:29.450
you see they created another problem is to sort of a condition our minds.

12:29.610 --> 12:32.450
This also we should face directly.

12:32.610 --> 12:36.450
Specially for Britishers, it is important to face that, very important

12:36.530 --> 12:40.890
because I have been noticing it is happening. Now what happens?

12:41.450 --> 12:44.450
Supposing, you are an aggressor means what do you do?

12:44.530 --> 12:46.010
I would see in a stark way,

12:46.170 --> 12:49.450
just forget that you are Britisher just go away from it.

12:49.530 --> 12:56.610
You just think like this that this is your house then you become quite hefty

12:56.970 --> 13:00.450
and you go and attack another person, driving him out of his house,

13:00.530 --> 13:08.170
stay there nicely for 300 years. It is that. As simple as that.

13:08.530 --> 13:11.530
That’s what the forefathers have done here

13:11.810 --> 13:15.450
and they have conditioned our mind, means what have we done.

13:15.530 --> 13:19.450
That means you have no respect for anybody else's culture.

13:20.770 --> 13:22.770
Simple as that.

13:22.970 --> 13:26.930
That they showed no respect for anybody else's life.

13:27.490 --> 13:30.450
To them, they were the ones that could occupy other countries,

13:30.530 --> 13:35.130
they could capture other countries and live there, dominate there.

13:37.890 --> 13:42.130
But as a result of that the conditioning is still in the minds

13:42.770 --> 13:48.970
because when we live, say in the ashram - I was very happy to know

13:49.130 --> 13:54.450
that the ashram of Brighton is looking so much better,

13:55.570 --> 13:58.930
people are looking after, is a very big thing

13:59.090 --> 14:01.970
that shows that you respect.

14:02.250 --> 14:07.130
That place which is a holy place you are looking after it.

14:08.130 --> 14:12.770
Otherwise, formerly the ashram was this that the bills would rise,

14:13.210 --> 14:17.610
so high that everybody became bankrupt with that.

14:17.970 --> 14:20.850
Everything was broken. Everything was thrown away.

14:21.050 --> 14:23.970
They lived the way they like. All the lights were on all the time.

14:24.170 --> 14:27.050
All the fire was on. This happened that happened. I mean,

14:27.210 --> 14:30.970
impossible to put them together in any place it was like that.

14:31.210 --> 14:37.770
Today, I was so happy to learn that it is an ashram where people respect.

14:38.250 --> 14:44.170
So, to be more on the right side we should know, do we respect.

14:44.610 --> 14:47.450
Do we respect others' properties?

14:47.770 --> 14:54.450
This is not others', this is Mother’s property. I mean, ah,

14:54.530 --> 14:59.690
you give them any sofa set, after 10 days you go and see it's all

14:59.850 --> 15:07.450
broken, finished. Anything it used to happen like that.

15:07.530 --> 15:11.530
Now, this should come that we have to respect.

15:11.930 --> 15:14.810
We have to respect now the property

15:14.970 --> 15:19.450
which is first of all started with Sahaja Yoga property

15:20.250 --> 15:24.450
and then it will start with others. We have to respect.

15:25.010 --> 15:29.010
Then another conditioning that we have from the society

15:29.170 --> 15:33.170
we must face it, is very funny is this that nobody

15:33.530 --> 15:38.730
respects anybody’s wife or anybody’s husband. They are married

15:38.890 --> 15:42.690
but their eyes will be on somebody’s wife, somebody's husband.

15:43.490 --> 15:48.450
How can you do that? See to the subtle side,

15:48.530 --> 15:50.570
because now you have become subtler people

15:50.770 --> 15:54.450
and you must see these problems exist in our country

15:54.530 --> 15:59.050
that we have got this conditioning around us is all this going on.

15:59.530 --> 16:04.730
Somebody’s wife is going with somebody’s husband. No respect.

16:05.170 --> 16:09.450
They are married people, how can you carry on with somebody’s wife

16:09.530 --> 16:11.570
or somebody’s husband.

16:11.810 --> 16:15.130
Just think of the society in which we live. Isn’t it?

16:15.490 --> 16:17.890
Now somebody is married to someone,

16:18.650 --> 16:25.570
now you cannot carry on with a person who belongs to somebody else.

16:26.090 --> 16:28.530
Is a simple thing like that.

16:28.930 --> 16:33.450
But is all, you see in the society you live in that kind of a society.

16:33.890 --> 16:36.170
I mean every day we have here such news,

16:36.490 --> 16:38.650
I mean it’s just shocking sometimes.

16:38.890 --> 16:40.170
So, we have to face the problems with which you are living

16:40.490 --> 16:41.930
like Indians have their own problems

16:42.490 --> 16:44.850
and they are horrid on that line.

16:45.050 --> 16:48.450
So, we have to face our problems so first of all we have to know

16:48.530 --> 16:51.770
that we must establish the Ishvara Pranidhana.

16:52.130 --> 16:55.930
Sahaja Yoga cannot be established by people who are shallow,

16:56.210 --> 16:58.530
who are superficially in Sahaja Yoga.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.730
Some people think they can play about,

17:00.890 --> 17:04.650
they feel happy by disturbing the ashramites,

17:04.810 --> 17:07.530
by talking against the ashram people about Sahaja Yogis,

17:07.730 --> 17:09.010
many I have seen,

17:09.170 --> 17:13.210
Sahaja Yogis are a horrid people as if other people are better.

17:14.530 --> 17:19.450
They go on like that playing. Now, what is the thing they lose.

17:19.530 --> 17:21.890
They are the losers. They don’t understand this.

17:22.170 --> 17:25.570
By doing this kind of a thing you are the loser.

17:25.890 --> 17:29.570
Whom are you playing with? You are playing against with yourself.

17:29.850 --> 17:34.570
Those people who try to criticize Sahaja yogis must know that

17:34.770 --> 17:39.450
they are cutting themselves out of Sahaja Yoga.

17:39.890 --> 17:45.530
And this is just that playing games and this should not be allowed.

17:47.810 --> 17:51.690
Nobody should criticize Sahaja Yogis which is a group.

17:51.850 --> 17:55.770
One individual Sahaja Yogi is doing wrong, I will know.

17:55.930 --> 18:01.450
So, it is very important that you should be accepted by the group.

18:01.650 --> 18:04.450
If you are an individual and think you are a great personality

18:04.530 --> 18:07.130
and you are trying to correct others,

18:07.970 --> 18:10.690
and say that the Sahaja Yogis are bad and the ashram is bad

18:10.850 --> 18:12.490
and do like that

18:13.610 --> 18:17.450
then you must know you are getting out of Sahaja Yoga.

18:17.770 --> 18:23.850
Very soon you will be out. So, one should not try these things

18:24.050 --> 18:26.450
and taking sides with newcomers.

18:26.610 --> 18:29.450
When the newcomers are coming you are more attached to the newcomers

18:29.530 --> 18:33.530
than to the Sahaja Yogis, then be sure you are not there.

18:34.770 --> 18:36.730
That’s one of the ways you can judge.

18:36.970 --> 18:42.450
Are you with the collectivity or are you trying to get out of it

18:42.530 --> 18:46.450
and trying to control all the rest?

18:46.730 --> 18:50.450
All right, this is one of the ways of understanding yourself.

18:50.530 --> 18:54.850
All such tricks will put you out of Sahaja Yoga

18:57.570 --> 19:01.170
and I think this is what Pluto is working out now.

19:01.490 --> 19:04.450
So, we should be very careful. It’s nice to celebrate,

19:04.530 --> 19:06.730
but spirituality is purity.

19:06.890 --> 19:10.450
If your heart is not pure, you'll be thrown out.

19:13.530 --> 19:21.130
Pluto is purity and purity has one quality that it is very joy-giving.

19:21.730 --> 19:25.450
It's glorious to be pure to be innocent

19:25.530 --> 19:30.450
but it also means that many things have to be dropped out

19:30.610 --> 19:34.690
and those who don’t drop out will be dropped out with those things.

19:35.050 --> 19:39.450
So, I want to warn you that it’s a very good day that I started today.

19:40.130 --> 19:44.170
But this is the problem we'll be facing now so be very careful,

19:44.490 --> 19:49.770
don’t play games with Sahaja Yoga. Clean your heart.

19:50.010 --> 19:53.650
This is from few people I know who are doing these things.

19:53.890 --> 19:56.450
I know about every one of them.

19:56.890 --> 20:02.450
So those who are against collectivity will be immediately dropped out.

20:02.970 --> 20:07.450
And then even if they want to come back, they cannot.

20:07.850 --> 20:10.690
So, try to be one with the group.

20:11.170 --> 20:16.170
Try to have better friendship, better relationships, better brotherhood,

20:16.530 --> 20:20.810
greater love, greater affection, complete understanding.

20:20.970 --> 20:24.770
Enjoy each other. That’s the best way.

20:25.650 --> 20:28.530
Sahaja Yogis should enjoy each other not the others.

20:30.650 --> 20:33.770
Others are others till they come to us.

20:34.450 --> 20:39.650
Remember that. In the eyes of God, others are others.

20:39.810 --> 20:42.970
Sahaja Yogis are his people.

20:43.770 --> 20:47.930
Others are not important at all at all at all.

20:48.130 --> 20:50.090
If they come well and good.

20:50.250 --> 20:52.250
Of course, one should not be harsh with them,

20:52.570 --> 20:55.210
be kindly, be nice, bring them along.

20:56.450 --> 20:59.970
But in a group, you are to be one.

21:00.250 --> 21:02.450
Then there shouldn’t be no differentiation.

21:02.530 --> 21:06.810
I mean that is one of the qualities the English had once upon a time.

21:07.170 --> 21:10.810
When Calais was invaded, you know at the time of Queen Elizabeth.

21:11.130 --> 21:15.130
The Catholics and the Roman, the Catholics and the protestants

21:15.450 --> 21:20.170
all joined together forgetting their differences.

21:21.130 --> 21:26.450
I hope you remember those good qualities of the English also.

21:27.050 --> 21:29.450
And that’s what one has to understand that

21:29.530 --> 21:35.450
when we are facing others, we are all one.

21:35.970 --> 21:40.450
And this is I am telling you again that unity is extremely important

21:40.530 --> 21:42.450
for the strength of Sahaja Yoga.

21:42.610 --> 21:46.530
Those who try to correct the Sahaja Yogis all the time

21:46.730 --> 21:51.450
are really trying to play into the hands of satan.

21:51.970 --> 21:59.890
They are doing no good to Sahaja Yoga. Be careful of such people.

22:00.450 --> 22:04.530
They will be thrown away. They'll lose their vibrations.

22:04.690 --> 22:06.570
And you'll find them out.

22:06.770 --> 22:11.850
So, Sahaja Yoga as it is a very great force of getting people together

22:12.010 --> 22:14.530
Also, there is this force which is working which is throwing out.

22:14.730 --> 22:19.930
Because here only those who will improve will become higher and higher,

22:20.090 --> 22:24.450
will be acceptable, there is no other criteria you know that.

22:25.170 --> 22:29.770
Those who become purer and purer are accepted as Sahaja Yogis.

22:29.970 --> 22:32.450
You are all Sahaja Yogis here sitting down

22:32.810 --> 22:38.170
but all of you have to become better and better and better.

22:38.730 --> 22:43.450
The first thing that will happen that you'll be clear-headed.

22:43.930 --> 22:48.450
What I find is that tamo gunis have no clear head.

22:49.170 --> 22:53.010
First thing, I call somebody X, "Mr. X come along",

22:53.530 --> 22:57.010
or a lady comes to me, the first reaction is

22:57.210 --> 23:00.170
puts up her head like that, with a barrier, you see.

23:00.610 --> 23:07.090
Say, now I'll say that this carpet is to be say cleaned up.

23:08.130 --> 23:12.450
"What? Which one? Where?"

23:13.250 --> 23:18.770
I said this carpet is to be cleaned. (Sahaja Yogis laugh).

23:23.530 --> 23:27.450
The another question start. You go on telling ten answers

23:27.530 --> 23:33.450
but nothing goes, there is a barrier. Nothing goes in that.

23:34.170 --> 23:37.450
They just don’t understand.

23:37.530 --> 23:40.170
Now how to explain anything to such people.

23:40.490 --> 23:42.450
There's no clear head in there.

23:42.530 --> 23:44.770
The whole head is clouded you see

23:44.930 --> 23:48.450
with a barrier which doesn’t want to take anything.

23:49.050 --> 23:52.850
So, all my lectures are nothing but a sing-song, I think.

23:53.010 --> 23:58.010
Nothing goes in their head. So, first of all the purity of heart.

23:58.890 --> 24:04.010
You know that the heart has got seven chakras, around it,

24:04.210 --> 24:08.090
the seven auras and when the heart is clean the light is clean.

24:08.250 --> 24:10.970
The Sahastrara becomes clean, absolutely.

24:11.170 --> 24:15.170
First is that, complete dedication of the heart should be there.

24:15.530 --> 24:19.970
That I’m going to be perfectly all right

24:20.130 --> 24:23.450
and I'm going to be an ideal Sahaja Yogi,

24:23.970 --> 24:27.450
It is my responsibility.

24:27.890 --> 24:34.050
Then all this will go away because this muddled head business.

24:35.690 --> 24:43.770
I think they hear 50%, 25% they forget and 25% is lost.

24:44.090 --> 24:48.450
So, what do they understand what I talk?

24:49.450 --> 24:55.610
So, this kind of barrier is a fashion also; is a fashion.

24:55.770 --> 24:59.970
I have noticed it's a fashion, in this country specially

25:00.170 --> 25:02.930
because if you tell them something, there is no need,

25:03.090 --> 25:07.010
but first they will repeat my question, "This is the question."

25:07.650 --> 25:10.690
I say, "What is your name?" "You said what is my name?"

25:10.850 --> 25:13.450
I said, yes. What is your name? (Sahaja Yogis Laugh).

25:14.210 --> 25:18.930
Oh! Do you mean, I didn’t understand.

25:19.250 --> 25:26.010
Oh! I said what’s your name? They'll go on like that.

25:26.530 --> 25:29.770
And by that they think they are being very sophisticated.

25:30.890 --> 25:32.770
Is a new English style, I think.

25:32.930 --> 25:35.530
Some French have nonsensical ideas about sophisticated

25:35.690 --> 25:38.170
but English sophistication I can’t understand.

25:38.530 --> 25:40.050
What this sophistication is?

25:40.530 --> 25:44.850
Then while talking they will say ten times Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

25:45.250 --> 25:47.090
I can’t understand. Why?

25:47.250 --> 25:50.930
Why can’t you speak straightforward thing what is to be said.

25:51.090 --> 25:53.450
Now you must train up. Imagine,

25:53.530 --> 25:59.050
a Sahaja Yogi standing up to give a lecture with many Ah! Ah! Ah!

25:59.530 --> 26:03.450
Then they'll think are they saying some mantras or what?

26:07.530 --> 26:10.530
So, one has to understand in Sahaja Yoga,

26:10.690 --> 26:15.570
you have to become very dignified, decent, pure people.

26:15.770 --> 26:21.850
The purity is the point we have to say. Now, out of say hundred,

26:22.010 --> 26:26.930
even if twenty are like that, muddled-headed,

26:27.170 --> 26:29.770
it creates a bad impression.

26:31.770 --> 26:36.450
What will others think that these muddle-headed people.

26:36.850 --> 26:39.090
What are they going to do? How are they saints?

26:39.250 --> 26:43.530
I mean imagine a saint like this. You are saints no doubt.

26:43.690 --> 26:46.450
But little saint, no saint, saint, saint, no saint.

26:46.530 --> 26:49.530
It is like that (Shree Mataji and Sahaja Yogis laugh).

26:51.170 --> 26:55.530
So important for 20% people it is

26:55.970 --> 27:00.530
not to blame any bhoots anymore and play about, but try.

27:00.770 --> 27:04.450
Get your heads cleared out by your heart being cleared,

27:04.530 --> 27:08.450
your head will be cleared. It’s only through your heart,

27:08.530 --> 27:13.970
you will get a clear idea as to be what is to be done

27:15.770 --> 27:17.810
and the innocence.

27:18.170 --> 27:24.050
If you start respecting others, other things, innocence will come.

27:27.730 --> 27:31.770
That innocence only comes through respect; people don’t know.

27:32.170 --> 27:34.650
So many said, "Mother how to get back purity?"

27:34.970 --> 27:39.570
Get back our innocence is simple, respect yourself.

27:39.810 --> 27:44.090
Your chastity you respect first. Respect your chastity.

27:45.450 --> 27:48.690
Respect others' chastity.

27:50.650 --> 27:55.450
Then others' things, others' relationships.

27:55.850 --> 27:59.130
Respect your relationship with others.

27:59.650 --> 28:03.450
He's a Sahaja Yogi, you are a Sahaja Yogi, he's a saint, I'm a saint.

28:03.730 --> 28:11.690
I have to respect and then see the joy and the love.

28:13.770 --> 28:17.650
This muddle-headedness has brought also another problem is today

28:17.810 --> 28:21.850
that the bank, my bank was very angry you see

28:22.010 --> 28:24.450
because I don’t know how you people reach there

28:24.530 --> 28:29.170
with a cash money or something. They had to pay.

28:30.730 --> 28:32.970
That should not have been done.

28:33.170 --> 28:39.090
Is a simple thing is that you have to buy a dollar thing and pay it there.

28:40.530 --> 28:43.450
And the bank people couldn’t understand how Geeta have relationships

28:43.530 --> 28:48.450
with such mad people and they called them strange also.

28:48.890 --> 28:51.530
For the simple thing was to make it into dollar,

28:51.690 --> 28:53.770
it would have cost two pounds more.

28:54.130 --> 28:59.450
But that’s another thing that a money-saving device is also.

28:59.850 --> 29:05.050
They are quite experts. Immediately, if I tell somebody now,

29:05.450 --> 29:10.650
"You go and get so much of say paint", say,

29:10.810 --> 29:13.490
paint is an example I'm just giving.

29:13.650 --> 29:16.730
So, they'll say there was a tin available, they'll come back.

29:17.170 --> 29:20.450
But that tin was so much and this tin was so much.

29:20.530 --> 29:23.450
I said: "What's that, bring the big tin." "No, but

29:23.530 --> 29:26.690
this one we can return if it is finished and that one we cannot."

29:26.850 --> 29:30.450
Say "now bring the big tin". Now, what does it matter, you see,

29:30.530 --> 29:33.890
in a paint in a house like this, such a huge thing.

29:34.050 --> 29:38.450
A little paint more or, but so much of understanding you see,

29:38.530 --> 29:43.450
how much you can save in that, how much, I mean save pound is another,

29:43.810 --> 29:47.450
everything blowing in our head to "Save pounds!" you see,

29:47.530 --> 29:49.450
being it any advertisement, "Save pounds!"

29:49.530 --> 29:52.170
Means spending pounds you really save pounds.

29:52.490 --> 29:54.770
You don’t understand the trick but you all the time think,

29:54.970 --> 29:59.170
what is the saving. Where can we save? Where can we cut?

29:59.530 --> 30:05.610
This is a waste of energy, completely. Just waste of energy.

30:05.890 --> 30:08.650
If you go on thinking like that, you'll go mad I think

30:08.810 --> 30:11.570
because Sahaja Yogis cannot do that.

30:12.210 --> 30:15.530
You will see that money comes very easy to people

30:15.850 --> 30:18.010
if you are relaxed about money.

30:18.170 --> 30:20.650
But if you try to save money, you'll never save

30:20.810 --> 30:24.210
and that’s why in England, people cannot save pounds

30:24.730 --> 30:27.450
because they just see the advertisements.

30:28.050 --> 30:32.450
Any advertisement like that "Save pounds", must be avoided, completely.

30:36.810 --> 30:40.450
In Sahaja Yoga, we have to believe that God looks after.

30:40.930 --> 30:43.450
It is he who is going to do things for us.

30:43.690 --> 30:46.770
If you put your attention to saving money

30:46.970 --> 30:51.010
then God doesn’t bother about saving your money.

30:52.210 --> 30:56.170
You know that miracles have happened about money for so many people.

30:56.930 --> 31:01.530
Like I went to Patrick’s place I will tell you, Patrick, you see,

31:01.690 --> 31:05.450
I ask him, "Patrick, you never received any money". He said, "no Mother".

31:05.530 --> 31:10.530
I said, "don’t tell me lies. Did you receive any money?" He said, "No Mother".

31:10.770 --> 31:13.450
I said, "Are you sure you haven’t received any money?"

31:13.530 --> 31:15.450
Then he came out with the truth, "Yes,

31:15.530 --> 31:21.450
I found thousand dollars, kept on my table one time."

31:25.530 --> 31:28.450
But that was I thought that should be a good beginning for him to see

31:28.530 --> 31:33.450
but he went around, the other way around he thought that "Oh God,

31:33.530 --> 31:35.450
mother loves me so much and she thinks too much of me.

31:35.530 --> 31:40.090
So now I can go ahead." He started going like a,

31:40.530 --> 31:45.170
I don't know what should I compare him to, a bull or what?

31:45.530 --> 31:50.450
Just he became a big great man, a big great leader, everything,

31:50.530 --> 31:54.450
he got bloated up, you see. He started driving like a balloon rises,

31:54.530 --> 31:58.010
you see, in the air. Like that it happened.

31:58.970 --> 32:02.530
But if you have depth, and if you have your dharma,

32:02.730 --> 32:06.090
and if you have Ganesha with you, then you go deep.

32:06.250 --> 32:10.250
"Oh! Mother has done this. What a miracle! How she has achieved it?

32:10.650 --> 32:17.050
Who is she? How did she do? She looked after us so well." Go down.

32:17.530 --> 32:20.530
Don’t float in the air like a balloon.

32:22.490 --> 32:26.450
So, this is what one has to understand.

32:26.530 --> 32:31.450
This is another conditioning we have of saving money, saving money.

32:31.530 --> 32:35.130
Let’s save here, let’s save there. Ultimately, what you find,

32:35.450 --> 32:41.050
no money to go to India. Last minute, borrow from here,

32:41.210 --> 32:44.450
borrow from there, go to the thing get it.

32:48.090 --> 32:52.570
So trust in God. God will look after you.

32:52.770 --> 32:58.810
You have to have trust, trust in others, trust in everything.
in others, trust in eve I trust you. I always trust you.

32:59.530 --> 33:02.490
Beyond, any trusting that is possible, for everything.

33:02.650 --> 33:08.450
Today only somebody came who was here,

33:09.130 --> 33:11.450
he told me that 25% prices have risen up in India.

33:11.530 --> 33:16.890
But I think the amount nowadays is how much it is.

33:17.530 --> 33:21.450
A Sahaja Yogi says: "25 dollars, 5%" That is how much it is.

33:21.530 --> 33:26.530
5% money have raised.

33:26.690 --> 33:28.130
So, Warren was rather worried, mother how will you manage now with 5%.

33:28.530 --> 33:32.450
I said, "I’ll manage", a vow of trust, I have trust that I can do it.

33:32.530 --> 33:39.450
I can trust myself and I can trust you.

33:39.530 --> 33:42.970
So, this is important that you have to trust each other.

33:43.610 --> 33:47.450
First of all, you trust yourself and trust others.

33:48.130 --> 33:51.450
By trust only you can work out wonders.

33:51.610 --> 33:55.450
If you don’t trust people, doubt everyone, you cannot work out.

33:55.530 --> 34:00.090
It makes the whole organization very, very fickle.

34:00.250 --> 34:05.450
So try to trust each other. I know there could be a wrong person.

34:06.010 --> 34:11.850
I'll take that person out. I know who it is.

34:12.170 --> 34:14.770
You just don’t worry but you try to trust and don’t worry

34:15.090 --> 34:19.770
as to what is going to happen.

34:20.170 --> 34:22.450
Trust yourself and trust the God Almighty,

34:22.530 --> 34:28.450
because he's the one who is going to look after us,

34:29.010 --> 34:31.770
yoga kshema vahami. If you have the yoga, you will get the kshema.

34:31.970 --> 34:36.810
Yoga must be established so you get the kshema.

34:37.130 --> 34:39.770
Second part of it is not first, the first is Yoga, establish to your yoga

34:40.290 --> 34:47.090
and then you will be amazed how things work out.

34:47.290 --> 34:51.450
And so many people asked me that,

34:52.370 --> 34:54.610
"Mother why only in England this problem is this."

34:54.810 --> 34:58.450
There is unemployment all over the world.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.690
There is problem everywhere,

35:00.890 --> 35:03.450
but the last minute is business of going to Coutts. Imagine,

35:03.650 --> 35:08.530
Coutts is in England, England. While we have got money already paid,

35:08.730 --> 35:14.570
even from Vancouver and from Australia, all paid long time back,

35:14.850 --> 35:21.050
while the English people were today queueing up in Coutts & company.

35:21.410 --> 35:25.170
And the Coutts & company became mad

35:26.330 --> 35:28.610
and they said "What sort of thing it is, Mother?

35:28.850 --> 35:30.650
We don’t want to have your accounts."

35:30.850 --> 35:33.690
So, what is the reason for that, that we have not trusted ourselves,

35:37.410 --> 35:42.450
we have not trusted others. Some people told me, that

35:42.530 --> 35:45.330
they made a mistake, they forgot about it, how can it be?

35:45.530 --> 35:50.450
So, this messy nature must go away, we have to do it systematically.

35:51.170 --> 35:55.690
We have to be systematic about Sahaja Yoga.

35:56.130 --> 35:58.450
As you have now started meditating in the morning time

35:58.730 --> 36:01.970
and doing all those things. I am sure the system will work out.

36:02.250 --> 36:05.730
The system of God should be there. And it so automatically works out.

36:05.930 --> 36:11.330
In three days, we have planned such a big, huge ashram, in three days.

36:12.610 --> 36:17.210
I mean, in one day I planned of course,

36:18.050 --> 36:20.130
but in two days we've drawn it and finished.

36:20.330 --> 36:22.610
Two days you took. Two days. Such a huge plan.

36:22.810 --> 36:27.530
You can’t imagine, if you see it. Have you got it with you?

36:27.730 --> 36:31.330
You haven’t got it, otherwise we'd have shown you.

36:31.530 --> 36:34.210
With four floors and very beautiful architecture and great design,

36:34.450 --> 36:40.130
facade, six floors in 4 floors

36:40.330 --> 36:45.370
and a beautiful place and everything organized.

36:47.090 --> 36:51.090
So how? I mean, I am not an architect, I am nothing of the kind

36:51.650 --> 36:55.890
but it was all done. In the same way, you can all have those powers.

36:56.090 --> 37:01.770
You have to just assume that you are saints.

37:02.170 --> 37:05.250
You must know you are saints and behold the way you are a saint,

37:05.450 --> 37:14.170
accordingly, it should behold your position

37:14.410 --> 37:20.770
as a saint, to live like saints, to behave like saints.

37:21.410 --> 37:25.770
It is not just what ways you put up or features you put up

37:25.970 --> 37:29.450
but the temperamentally, the generosity,

37:29.530 --> 37:33.010
the kindness, the compassion, the love, the nourishment,

37:33.210 --> 37:36.450
that you have to give to each other and to the whole world.

37:36.530 --> 37:40.170
If you cannot give it to Sahaja Yogis, you cannot give it to anyone.

37:40.370 --> 37:44.450
The first test is how far you love each other in Sahaja Yoga.

37:44.650 --> 37:48.450
It’s nice to see all of you here today on this great occasion.

37:49.290 --> 37:55.010
Also, I feel sad that I have to leave you now.

37:55.210 --> 37:57.690
I am going to India and I am going to meet you there, all of you.

37:58.250 --> 38:02.450
I hope so many of you are coming down.

38:02.530 --> 38:05.450
Now, to India when you are coming also come with a deeper enquiry.

38:05.850 --> 38:15.450
Because, superficially if you see, that country doesn’t have your comforts,

38:16.730 --> 38:21.450
doesn’t have this paper, you know,

38:21.530 --> 38:23.450
may not have carpets but it has got a heart.

38:23.530 --> 38:29.450
They have got a heart.

38:29.530 --> 38:32.250
A very large heart and whatever they do they do it from their heart.

38:32.490 --> 38:38.450
If somebody is very superficial can even ridicule them for their sincerity,

38:39.450 --> 38:43.450
can even make fun of them that they are so stupid to be that sincere.

38:44.010 --> 38:47.450
I mean, according to modern ideas.

38:47.890 --> 38:50.450
But you have to develop that heart.

38:51.370 --> 38:54.450
A simple innocent giving heart,

38:55.530 --> 38:58.730
which enjoys, which has the fondness to do.

38:58.930 --> 39:01.090
I mean I had to tell them now, argument is the other way around.

39:01.290 --> 39:04.450
You will be amazed if I tell you the arguments were,

39:04.530 --> 39:06.770
like when Modi came here and he said we want them to stay in Bombay

39:07.090 --> 39:11.330
but I said why? Bombay is an expensive place. No Mother,

39:11.530 --> 39:14.130
we will bear half the expenses but let them stay there.

39:14.330 --> 39:16.890
Why, you see that’s what we want?

39:17.170 --> 39:18.850
I mean the whole thing was argument, you remember?

39:19.050 --> 39:21.090
We want to do something for them, they are coming to our country now.

39:21.290 --> 39:24.610
We want to make some nice things you see,

39:24.810 --> 39:26.450
we will make some nice food for them.

39:26.530 --> 39:28.450
I said, don’t make over do, simple food should do. No, no Mother,

39:28.530 --> 39:31.450
but that’s the only chance we have got.

39:31.530 --> 39:35.450
And the whole argument was how they will afford.

39:35.930 --> 39:38.450
Then they said we should have,

39:38.530 --> 39:41.450
I said have just five days, in that place where, Bordi,

39:41.530 --> 39:47.210
So, I said at least make it seven days mother,

39:47.410 --> 39:50.850
please seven days because that will be easier,

39:51.050 --> 39:53.450
poor things will be coming and then they would like to sleep for one day,

39:53.530 --> 39:57.450
after all they would be tired, so one day is gone,

39:57.530 --> 40:00.450
two days like this and the other group will be coming so you see

40:00.530 --> 40:04.250
they are just thinking how to make you comfortable,

40:04.450 --> 40:06.490
how make you happy, what to feed you, what to do.

40:06.690 --> 40:11.450
But if you want to see something superficial

40:12.130 --> 40:13.970
you might try to find some faults.

40:14.170 --> 40:17.370
And I have seen, people spoil, people spoil.

40:19.130 --> 40:24.330
They really, they spoiled so many Sahaja Yogis by their overdoing

40:24.770 --> 40:28.850
which was never understood why they did it.

40:29.050 --> 40:32.450
Now gradually you are understanding.

40:33.330 --> 40:36.290
You have to become that kind of a personality that gives that nourishes.

40:36.530 --> 40:43.930
That is fond of doing for others. What should I do?

40:45.530 --> 40:50.450
What should I buy for you? What should I get for you?

40:50.650 --> 40:54.450
You see, it’s such a joy. You see, my special joy is in that.

40:54.770 --> 40:58.450
I mean, in America, I was at least 25% of time

40:58.650 --> 41:02.330
I was busy buying things because I have to give presents

41:02.570 --> 41:04.890
and they said, "Mother what are you doing?"

41:05.090 --> 41:06.450
I said, "I enjoy, just forget it."

41:06.530 --> 41:09.450
If had time this time I would have bought something for you people before going.

41:10.330 --> 41:15.250
Just I enjoyed that’s what, just enjoy giving.

41:15.450 --> 41:19.410
I wish, you could just jump on the other side,

41:19.850 --> 41:22.450
other bank of this river and see the joy of giving is so great,

41:22.530 --> 41:28.850
is much greater than getting anything for yourself.

41:29.210 --> 41:32.450
And with this idea you should go and see how they enjoy.

41:32.650 --> 41:36.450
If I tell them, a lady was there,

41:37.410 --> 41:39.450
she said that you must come and have breakfast with us.

41:39.530 --> 41:42.450
I said, "I have at least forty people with me,

41:42.530 --> 41:46.450
how can I come to your house?"

41:46.530 --> 41:49.450
She said, "No, we will arrange, don't you worry."

41:49.770 --> 41:52.450
So, all the neighbors you see, got up at four o’clock,

41:52.530 --> 41:54.450
prepared all the breakfast for us. Everything ready,

41:54.530 --> 41:57.450
when we went that was so beautifully organized

41:57.530 --> 41:59.450
and those people who were with us coming,

41:59.530 --> 42:05.450
you were there I think that time. He is here. He is outside.

42:06.090 --> 42:09.090
So, the first group, I think the second group was there.

42:09.290 --> 42:12.250
Gavin you remember that lady who, "I came the day after that."

42:12.490 --> 42:15.050
Day after that? You missed the point.

42:16.530 --> 42:20.170
"I know the story" Isn’t it? Just imagine and they were so happy,

42:20.370 --> 42:23.450
and they were so happy feeding and giving,

42:23.530 --> 42:25.450
and all of them were running and you will see this.

42:25.530 --> 42:31.450
You will see yourself and they never tell me any problems,

42:31.770 --> 42:34.690
always solutions. They are there with the solutions.

42:35.050 --> 42:38.450
You tell them now the problem is, you see, they want to go by a bus.

42:38.730 --> 42:41.410
We can’t afford to keep the buses for long time. No,

42:41.610 --> 42:44.450
that’s all right, we will get you buses. They will take you down.

42:44.530 --> 42:48.450
You don’t worry. Now we have this problem, what to do?

42:48.530 --> 42:51.250
Don’t worry, we will manage Mother. We will get it.

42:51.450 --> 42:54.450
All the time they are giving solutions to me but here,

42:54.530 --> 42:57.450
it’s the other way around, the problems.

42:57.690 --> 43:03.890
The problems, the sentence starts with, "Now today is a disaster."

43:04.410 --> 43:09.050
"What’s the disaster?" "The milkman has not come."

43:14.690 --> 43:18.050
Always something starts with the problem.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.450
Now, have you any solutions?

43:21.050 --> 43:22.650
Have we any solutions?

43:22.850 --> 43:26.450
Only the persons who can think of solutions can construct.

43:26.850 --> 43:31.450
So, remember that is very common and I get really frustrated.

43:31.530 --> 43:34.450
Sometimes, I really get irritated.

43:34.530 --> 43:38.450
Everybody has some problems or some problems, some problems

43:39.599 --> 43:45.450
and even if you give a solution, "BUT", "But what?'

43:45.530 --> 43:49.450
I am giving a solution. But it could be that, it could be this,

43:49.530 --> 43:55.650
but why don’t you find out. I mean they know all about it.

43:55.857 --> 43:57.777
Supposing you say, "Let’s go by this road",

43:57.970 --> 44:00.450
"But there could be a traffic."

44:00.530 --> 44:04.050
I said, "How do you know sitting down here?"

44:05.530 --> 44:08.450
But at this time this is this.

44:08.530 --> 44:15.530
Everybody is so knowledgeable with the ideas how to create problems

44:15.730 --> 44:20.210
and never solutions. Such a knowledge is useless, I think.

44:20.810 --> 44:23.730
Such useless knowledge you must throw in the sea.

44:24.410 --> 44:27.850
Not very near Brighton because we are having solutions there.

44:35.530 --> 44:39.450
So, don’t create problems, don’t create problems.

44:39.650 --> 44:42.930
That’s very important is not to have any problems.

44:43.210 --> 44:46.850
Try to find out solutions and give solutions.

44:47.050 --> 44:50.970
So, this language should be changed, "The problem is..."

44:51.330 --> 44:54.450
This language we are going to change from today.

44:55.130 --> 44:58.570
And you will be surprised all problems can be solved like that.

44:58.970 --> 45:02.090
Only change your direction.

45:02.410 --> 45:06.530
Supposing you are straight forward marching towards problems.

45:06.930 --> 45:10.330
Now what can you do, I mean, even if you are a Sahaja Yogi, no use,

45:10.530 --> 45:14.410
I mean you are going towards it but just turn your face

45:14.850 --> 45:18.050
from the problems, no problem.

45:18.650 --> 45:23.210
Believe me, there should be no problems for you.

45:25.530 --> 45:29.050
Have you noticed that happening?

45:30.930 --> 45:35.610
Then, last of all is to remember,

45:35.970 --> 45:39.730
that you must understand your Mother very well

45:42.090 --> 45:46.330
and do not jump into conclusions of your own

45:48.850 --> 45:51.770
and if you start jumping onto your own conclusions,

45:51.970 --> 45:54.450
you really create problems.

45:54.530 --> 46:00.930
Firstly, we must know that Sahaja Yoga, we cannot make any money out of it.

46:01.130 --> 46:06.210
There cannot be any commercial activity on Sahaja Yoga.

46:08.970 --> 46:13.450
As it is, I am hopelessly bad as far as money is concerned.

46:14.530 --> 46:17.450
You ask him, he will tell you those who have known me know that.

46:17.530 --> 46:19.450
I am hopelessly bad.

46:19.530 --> 46:23.930
I don’t know even how to sign a cheque even today I don’t know.

46:24.130 --> 46:26.450
When will I learn I don’t know may be

46:26.530 --> 46:29.170
because this is entering into the sixth house,

46:29.370 --> 46:31.450
I will be even worse now.

46:32.010 --> 46:36.530
So, first of all we are not going to have any time

46:36.770 --> 46:39.450
any kind of commercial activity

46:39.530 --> 46:46.010
and if you ever try it, I will see to it that you get depleted completely.

46:46.330 --> 46:49.930
So, no commercial activity for Sahaja Yoga.

46:50.370 --> 46:55.450
No commercial thing should be started in the name of Sahaja Yoga.

46:56.170 --> 47:04.330
Like I have seen somebody Nirmala Udyog in India means Nirmala enterprise.

47:05.370 --> 47:07.890
I mean this is not the way, this is not allowed.

47:08.290 --> 47:15.410
Or Sahaja Udyog we cannot do that. It’s all right Sahaja Yoga co-op,

47:15.650 --> 47:17.690
because Sahaja Yogis are there in cooperative

47:17.890 --> 47:21.450
but should not be a money-making proposition anywhere,

47:21.530 --> 47:24.770
any business, anything, don’t use the name of Sahaja Yoga.

47:25.090 --> 47:29.770
It will be spoiling it. It won’t be good.

47:30.170 --> 47:34.050
So, you must understand, that should not be done.

47:34.530 --> 47:38.490
Secondly, your Mother is an extremely practical woman,

47:39.010 --> 47:41.450
extremely practical.

47:42.170 --> 47:46.450
So, do not start thinking. You see, people get an idea.

47:46.530 --> 47:50.450
Just now we had one example of that.

47:51.330 --> 47:56.450
That somebody said that I want to keep [...].

47:56.530 --> 48:02.730
I mean, this is something even if I wear a hat, I don’t think like that.

48:04.530 --> 48:07.650
Because I don’t know how people jump into conclusions

48:07.850 --> 48:09.530
and they will say Mother said.

48:09.930 --> 48:13.010
This is another way of doing it.

48:14.250 --> 48:16.450
You must do the things that are practical.

48:16.530 --> 48:18.970
When I say that you should not try to save money

48:19.170 --> 48:21.570
doesn’t mean that you waste your money.

48:21.890 --> 48:27.370
So, one has to be very, very practical and pragmatic

48:27.650 --> 48:29.570
and that happens because you see,

48:29.770 --> 48:33.450
spirituality is the most practical thing. Sahaja Yoga,

48:33.530 --> 48:37.850
have you seen anything more practical than Sahaja Yoga?

48:39.130 --> 48:42.450
It’s the most practical thing but that doesn’t mean

48:42.530 --> 48:45.850
that you go to the bank and start seeing vibrations there,

48:46.050 --> 48:49.450
standing on Oxford street seeing the vibrations there.

48:49.530 --> 48:55.650
Seeing the vibrations of the balloon. This is stupid.

49:07.530 --> 49:12.450
Or I mean, this should not be done outside. I mean, Muslims also,

49:12.530 --> 49:16.290
when they do namaz, they look quite odd to me

49:16.490 --> 49:18.450
that standing on the street sometimes,

49:18.530 --> 49:21.450
and suddenly you will find a Muslim see spreading something

49:21.530 --> 49:31.450
and going up like that. It’s stupid. It's show off. It's a sacred thing.

49:32.210 --> 49:35.450
In the road I have seen people walking like this.

49:35.930 --> 49:40.450
I mean what is this, people will think you are mad or what.

49:41.570 --> 49:46.130
So, we have to be extremely decent people

49:46.330 --> 49:50.530
and understanding in what atmosphere we live.

49:50.810 --> 49:53.530
They don’t talk our language, they don’t understand us.

49:53.850 --> 49:59.450
So, we should not be ridiculous, we'll look like punk rocks.

50:07.530 --> 50:15.530
So, we have to be very decent, very poised people,

50:16.530 --> 50:24.530
affectionate, compassionate, soft spoken, sweet, kindly, and alert.

50:26.450 --> 50:30.450
Or we put the alert first.

50:32.290 --> 50:34.410
That way we have to be.

50:34.850 --> 50:38.450
I am telling you because the new year is now coming

50:38.770 --> 50:42.010
and in new year what you have to do

50:42.290 --> 50:44.850
is to give up all that is nonsensical

50:45.090 --> 50:47.330
and think of all that is good

50:47.650 --> 50:52.930
and that’s why we have to see what’s wrong with us.

50:53.290 --> 50:58.570
Now the last of all is that never get stuck on to any place.

50:58.930 --> 51:01.450
That’s the best way to live in this world.

51:01.650 --> 51:07.130
Live like a traveler. In this short life of mine, whatever it is,

51:07.730 --> 51:11.450
in these forty-five years or forty years of my married life,

51:11.530 --> 51:16.770
not yet forty I think it’s thirty-eight, we have changed about forty houses.

51:17.330 --> 51:21.450
I like it. Because it is sticking to any place.

51:22.170 --> 51:25.450
Now I have seen people get stuck to Surbiton now.

51:25.530 --> 51:30.450
Stuck, they get stuck to Chelsham Road.

51:30.530 --> 51:33.450
As soon as you get a feeling that you are getting stuck,

51:33.530 --> 51:38.450
leave that place and get out of there. Then this is my house,

51:38.530 --> 51:41.690
then this is my Surbiton, then that is my Chelsham Road.

51:42.130 --> 51:45.450
That’s not a sign of a saint. A saint is a traveler throughout,

51:45.650 --> 51:49.450
he doesn’t stick to anything.

51:49.930 --> 51:52.450
Now, how to sell this house, I will tell you tomorrow.

51:52.530 --> 51:56.450
At least, we need that, what we have done about it.

51:56.530 --> 52:00.450
There is no stickiness about it.

52:00.850 --> 52:05.290
Then the fight starts, then "Surbiton is my house.

52:05.490 --> 52:07.450
How dare you come here?"

52:07.930 --> 52:10.330
You are like this. "Chelsham Road is my house.

52:10.530 --> 52:15.890
I must do this thing for that." That’s how you get localized,

52:16.210 --> 52:21.050
you become malignant, no connection with the whole.

52:21.330 --> 52:25.450
This is just like a

52:28.530 --> 52:47.330
serai, a place where caravans go and settle down, caravanserai

52:47.530 --> 52:52.170
Like an inn. It’s an inn. It’s like an inn itself.

52:52.370 --> 52:56.450
You live in an inn, live there like an inn and then

52:56.650 --> 53:00.450
you have to go from this inn,

53:00.530 --> 53:06.450
your house and abode is the kingdom of God.

53:07.570 --> 53:11.210
There where we exist, there where we live

53:11.850 --> 53:15.690
and that is always with you, so what does it matter.

53:15.890 --> 53:19.450
These are all superficial things. It’s not important.

53:19.650 --> 53:22.650
Now because Mother stayed in a particular house

53:23.050 --> 53:26.450
so I have seen people running mad after that. I mean what is it.

53:26.530 --> 53:29.810
I am sitting here, what is the need to go to the house?

53:30.330 --> 53:33.450
It’s like I told you the other day, like having my photograph,

53:33.530 --> 53:38.330
taking vibrations from my photograph and I am giving a lecture here.

53:38.650 --> 53:45.450
Unduly we are paying attention to things which we should not.

53:45.530 --> 53:54.090
We should know that we are the temples of the God.

53:54.530 --> 53:59.450
We are the abode of God that God resides within us.

53:59.530 --> 54:08.770
The light has come within us. We have to be the beautiful temples of God.

54:10.530 --> 54:16.450
The most glorious place is yourself where God resides.

54:17.290 --> 54:22.450
So, all that is not wanted out of, should be thrown out of this temple

54:24.410 --> 54:30.210
and make yourself that clean beautiful temple

54:31.050 --> 54:33.770
where God would like to reside,

54:34.010 --> 54:41.450
otherwise he will disappear and that is what is Ishvara Pranidhana

54:41.690 --> 54:47.450
which we should try to maintain, establish and develop.

54:47.810 --> 54:50.610
And then it grows and grows and grows,

54:50.930 --> 54:53.450
the temple becomes a palace,

54:54.250 --> 55:04.170
a huge big place where many can come and enjoy the bliss of your heart.

55:04.530 --> 55:06.610
Let’s become like that.

55:06.970 --> 55:11.570
So today is a day of a pledge in a way in our hearts to say that

55:11.770 --> 55:15.450
whatever we do we'll do from our hearts

55:16.250 --> 55:21.450
because we are from the soil of the heart of the universe.

55:21.530 --> 55:25.450
So, this is a simple thing we have to just ask the Mother earth

55:25.530 --> 55:28.010
and she will give you the power to do that.

55:28.290 --> 55:31.450
Once you start becoming there, all this messiness,

55:31.530 --> 55:39.450
all this unruliness and the unsystematic way,

55:39.530 --> 55:45.450
all this untidiness about life, everything will disappear

55:46.090 --> 55:53.450
and there will be clear picture of the London Sahaja Yogis.

55:53.970 --> 56:02.450
I think I have given the maximum time to you and the least to Australia.

56:03.010 --> 56:09.170
I must say that they have proved so well.

56:09.530 --> 56:17.450
They have been so great, never given me a problem, always a solution.

56:18.210 --> 56:21.170
In the same way, London Sahaja Yogis

56:21.490 --> 56:24.450
should all of them should become people

56:24.530 --> 56:26.450
who will give solutions and no problem.

56:26.530 --> 56:32.450
So, the ‘but’ has to go away from our English language for Sahaja Yogis.

56:33.250 --> 56:41.450
So, I would also like to thank Dr. Warren Reeves for all the help

56:41.530 --> 56:44.450
he has done yet so far, so selflessly, so clear-headedly,

56:44.530 --> 56:50.450
so well, by settling down here to solve all the problems

56:50.650 --> 56:54.890
and to look after all the accounts which is the biggest headache for me

56:55.330 --> 56:58.570
and organizing, telephoning, finding out

56:58.770 --> 57:01.450
that you must really give him a big hand (everyone applause).

57:25.530 --> 57:30.730
So now we should have some nice music after this boring talk.

57:39.530 --> 57:42.090
What about some nice songs? (Every one laughs).
