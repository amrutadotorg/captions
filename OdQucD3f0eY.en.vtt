WEBVTT

05:37.949 --> 05:46.948
Yesterday, you had asked me for the status
of a Guru.

05:48.109 --> 05:54.792
It’s a state, it is not a status

05:54.993 --> 06:01.388
because status is external, can be bestowed
upon anyone,

06:01.589 --> 06:08.511
and anybody can say that, “This is
your status.”

06:09.478 --> 06:15.555
For something external merit, or something,
you can give a status to a person.

06:15.756 --> 06:22.009
It is a state. ‘State’ means the innate
being,

06:22.210 --> 06:32.580
evolved to that level that you become
the master.

06:34.300 --> 06:36.685
Of course,

06:39.120 --> 06:44.543
you have to be your own master to begin
with. No doubt about it.

06:44.744 --> 06:48.245
If you are not even your own master,

06:48.446 --> 06:55.721
then how you can achieve that state?

06:56.865 --> 07:03.302
Now as I say it is innate; then one starts
thinking,

07:03.503 --> 07:09.701
“If it is innate, in a Sahaj way, how do
we achieve?”

07:18.017 --> 07:25.363
There are certain faculties which we have
to develop to begin with.

07:28.183 --> 07:37.756
The first faculty is if we can become
thoughtless.

07:39.492 --> 07:46.544
In meditation you can become thoughtless
for a short time.

07:47.154 --> 07:52.803
Gradually this short time should go on
increasing –

07:53.004 --> 07:56.368
that you are without any thought.

07:58.697 --> 08:03.021
This happens also as we can say is a state,

08:04.825 --> 08:08.608
but how do we achieve that, again?

08:08.809 --> 08:13.959
Because human beings cannot understand
that anything can happen spontaneously,

08:14.160 --> 08:18.524
it has to be done some - something has
to be done.

08:18.725 --> 08:27.345
For that, in Sahaj, we have something
very, very simple,

08:29.931 --> 08:36.327
that you have got a mantra as ‘nirvichar’.

08:37.740 --> 08:43.912
So now you watch anything saying
the mantra,

08:44.113 --> 08:47.663
“Twameva sakshat nirvichar,”

08:48.348 --> 08:57.491
then you’ll start seeing that, witnessing
that, without thinking.

08:59.755 --> 09:02.926
Just see, witness.

09:05.375 --> 09:11.756
Just seeing itself creates that state
within us, the first state,

09:11.957 --> 09:18.422
is very important, that you become
the witness, the sakshi.

09:23.193 --> 09:28.174
As soon as you become a sakshi,

09:30.719 --> 09:34.731
the whole thing whatever you are seeing

09:37.806 --> 09:46.557
gives you the complete idea, subtle
as well as gross, of that thing.

09:46.758 --> 09:51.707
You see it and you know it

09:52.900 --> 09:58.027
and, as a Sahaja Yogi, it becomes
your knowledge.

09:58.228 --> 10:05.929
We can say, in the modern terminology,
that you see something,

10:06.241 --> 10:14.544
it gets recorded in your mind and it
manifests joy,

10:15.378 --> 10:24.505
it manifests knowledge, it manifests
compassion, whatever may [be] the situation.

10:25.466 --> 10:32.252
Because now you have many dimensions
which you have to develop,

10:32.453 --> 10:35.979
these dimensions are to be developed.

10:36.180 --> 10:42.556
Now supposing you go and meet someone
with whom you have to deal.

10:44.852 --> 10:51.130
He’s talking, talking, talking. Just become
thoughtless.

10:51.331 --> 10:55.122
So now, what is the thing that will happen
as soon as you become thoughtless?

10:55.323 --> 10:59.437
First his thoughts, his bombardment,
will not touch you

10:59.638 --> 11:02.917
because you are in a different realm
altogether.

11:03.118 --> 11:11.906
But in that realm your power will manifest:

11:12.107 --> 11:17.664
it may cool him down, it may shut him down

11:17.865 --> 11:24.647
or maybe he may just feel tremendous
love for you.

11:31.166 --> 11:35.968
So the word ‘guru’ means gravity:

11:37.284 --> 11:40.901
that the Mother Earth has gravity.

11:41.102 --> 11:47.908
In the same [way] a person who is a guru
has to have the gravity.

11:48.109 --> 11:51.537
But how do you develop this gravity?

11:51.738 --> 11:57.283
Some people just artificially become
very grave

11:57.484 --> 12:03.595
and sometimes show that they are very
serious or something like that.

12:04.911 --> 12:08.450
Gravity is within yourself.

12:09.507 --> 12:18.347
In the second state, we should say, of guru
pada, is your gravity must manifest.

12:18.548 --> 12:24.599
As you become the witness your gravity
starts expressing itself.

12:24.800 --> 12:31.443
It will not show as temper or seriousness
or anything like that.

12:31.644 --> 12:36.965
But it will manifest in a way that

12:38.538 --> 12:44.077
the whole thing will become extremely
dignified and majestic.

12:44.278 --> 12:47.671
It will just manifest by itself.

12:47.872 --> 12:57.017
So the state in which you rise, now becomes
effective.

12:57.820 --> 13:00.599
Before this it was not.

13:00.800 --> 13:09.029
You had to all the time manipulate,
say this, say that.

13:09.434 --> 13:16.998
But in your silence you can manifest
your gravity,

13:17.199 --> 13:25.183
and this gravity is extremely… it acts like
a magnet.

13:25.384 --> 13:28.699
As you know there’s a magnet in the Mother
Earth.

13:28.900 --> 13:34.420
That we call as the gravity, by which
people are attracted.

13:34.621 --> 13:40.366
We are resting on this Mother Earth because
of her gravity.

13:40.619 --> 13:46.856
Everything is attracted to Mother Earth
because of her gravity.

13:47.546 --> 13:54.898
So you get a magnetic temperament,
magnetic character,

13:55.713 --> 13:58.514
magnetic personality.

13:58.715 --> 14:04.572
And this magnetic personality that you
develop,

14:04.773 --> 14:10.397
immediately shows that it is manifesting
its power.

14:10.598 --> 14:16.401
Just try to understand. Like the light now
is coming on me:

14:16.602 --> 14:22.298
it’s just giving light, but it is not
manifesting anything.

14:22.905 --> 14:26.568
We can see the sun’s rays, is the best
example.

14:26.769 --> 14:35.556
Sun’s rays when they fall onto the leaves,
the rays, which look simple,

14:35.757 --> 14:41.577
manifest their power of making it
into chlorophyll.

14:41.778 --> 14:50.006
In the same way, when you are at that
height or at that state,

14:50.207 --> 14:57.780
then without saying anything, without doing
anything, even a glance –

15:00.235 --> 15:06.656
you manifest. But not only that, but you
record everything.

15:08.647 --> 15:15.358
So many people must have noticed that
I seldom forget things.

15:15.567 --> 15:24.344
Like once I was travelling and I saw some
red stones near Sangamner.

15:24.545 --> 15:28.873
And when I said that “Why not we have some
red stones for Pratishthana”.

15:29.074 --> 15:31.848
They said, “But there are no red stones
in the whole of Maharashtra.”

15:32.049 --> 15:34.259
I said, “There are.” “Where?”

15:34.460 --> 15:39.552
I said, “Go on the way of - you’ll find
them near Sangamner.” They said,

15:39.753 --> 15:42.394
“We have travelled so much that way,
we’ve never seen it.”

15:42.595 --> 15:45.435
I said, “I don’t know what you are seeing,
you know,

15:45.636 --> 15:48.369
what you are watching, I have definitely
seen.”

15:48.570 --> 15:53.050
When they went there, they saw mountains
and mountains of these red stones,

15:53.251 --> 15:56.820
and they never noticed it even.

16:00.218 --> 16:08.080
So now, when you start witnessing something
without thought

16:08.281 --> 16:13.312
there’s no obstruction for absorbing
the knowledge about that thing,

16:13.513 --> 16:16.474
because there’s no thought.

16:17.029 --> 16:25.145
It’s complete absorption takes place.
And then it manifests.

16:27.687 --> 16:36.403
This is how the Divine Power works
within us.

16:42.215 --> 16:46.503
So with our gravity

16:47.273 --> 16:51.998
what we do is to touch that depth
within us,

16:52.199 --> 16:56.826
which can carry the Divine Power and
manifest it.

16:57.027 --> 17:00.641
Unless and until we touch that depth
within us,

17:00.842 --> 17:07.864
Sahaja Yoga is like ‘Hare Rama
Hare Krishna’.

17:10.372 --> 17:16.638
Nothing better than that. And that’s why
I find so many Sahaja Yogis, sometimes,

17:16.839 --> 17:22.592
really go off their rails suddenly.

17:22.793 --> 17:28.943
Because they have no gravity to go down
into their own being

17:29.144 --> 17:33.261
and to feel the beauty and the glory
of their own being

17:33.462 --> 17:41.714
and to use that gravity for manifesting
Divine Power.

17:45.191 --> 17:53.087
We could say that, supposing there is
a vehicle which is very weak,

17:54.153 --> 17:57.886
which is not yet properly fixed,

17:58.087 --> 18:04.607
cannot be used for something substantial.

18:05.416 --> 18:11.373
And the most substantial thing in your
lives is this Divine Power;

18:11.574 --> 18:19.901
which looks very light. You never feel
the weight of this Divine Power.

18:20.102 --> 18:24.732
You’ll never feel the pressure of this
Divine Power.

18:26.918 --> 18:34.113
But if you are not clean, if your channel
is not clean,

18:34.314 --> 18:40.296
then this Divine Power cannot flow
properly, it cannot manifest.

18:40.497 --> 18:44.922
So when we say that we are the instrument
of God Almighty,

18:45.123 --> 18:49.195
then like this instrument we are; now we
are connected to the mains.

18:49.404 --> 18:52.504
If this instrument is not all right

18:52.705 --> 18:58.814
then it cannot manifest whatever it is
supposed to do.

18:59.015 --> 19:05.833
But we are much above all these ordinary
instruments,

19:06.034 --> 19:14.734
even the most complicated, even the most
advanced and developed by science.

19:14.935 --> 19:22.063
Because we reach a state where we ourselves
become the science.

19:22.264 --> 19:27.140
Science of Truth, an Absolute Truth.

19:27.341 --> 19:35.084
So what is needed for a Guru is
self-esteem.

19:35.285 --> 19:41.476
This is a very important point [which]
people don’t realise: the self-esteem.

19:43.090 --> 19:47.655
To achieve the self-esteem we have
to introspect

19:47.856 --> 19:54.436
and know that, “Today I am not what
I was before.

19:54.637 --> 20:01.415
I’m a realised soul. I have got powers.
Of course I have powers.

20:01.616 --> 20:08.932
Powers of love, powers of compassion,
powers of grasping things,

20:10.576 --> 20:20.405
powers of creativity, powers of giving
realisations to others.”

20:20.606 --> 20:23.569
Nobody had these powers!

20:23.770 --> 20:28.277
But somehow or other in Sahaja Yog we are
not self-conscious.

20:28.478 --> 20:32.551
And we should not be self-conscious because
that can give you ego,

20:32.752 --> 20:36.722
but we should have self-esteem.

20:36.923 --> 20:44.309
“I’m a Guru. I’m a Guru. I’m not
an ordinary person.

20:44.510 --> 20:49.790
I’m not on the street. I’m something
special.

20:49.991 --> 20:54.647
I’m on the shores of Truth.

20:54.848 --> 21:04.154
I have to salvage the people who are blind,
who are mad,” all kinds of things.

21:04.355 --> 21:09.454
In a most chaotic conditions this world
is today.

21:09.655 --> 21:18.401
So at that time a kind of a silence will
come within you.

21:18.602 --> 21:23.964
When there will be any such crisis,
immediately you’ll become extremely silent.

21:24.165 --> 21:27.560
But this is again a state I’m telling you.

21:27.761 --> 21:38.924
So now if there is something that makes
you upset or makes you unhappy,

21:39.738 --> 21:47.115
try to reach that point, that axis,
which is just silence.

21:48.259 --> 21:51.756
And this silence will make you really
powerful

21:51.957 --> 21:56.391
because this silence is not only yours.

21:56.592 --> 22:02.334
When you are in that silence you are
in the silence of the cosmos,

22:02.542 --> 22:12.845
silence of the cosmos. And the silence
of the cosmos works for you.

22:13.046 --> 22:15.993
You are in connection

22:19.441 --> 22:22.582
with that Cosmic Power we can call it,

22:22.783 --> 22:26.657
but it’s more than that, is Divine Power
I should say -

22:26.858 --> 22:31.311
Divine power which is working
all the cosmos also.

22:34.183 --> 22:44.046
So, if you just become silent within
yourself,

22:44.247 --> 22:49.367
know that you are sitting in the Kingdom
of God.

22:53.123 --> 22:58.801
It’s like this: when, say,

22:59.002 --> 23:10.756
you get the great honour of becoming
a king,

23:11.650 --> 23:18.113
then you walk up to your throne and you
sit down

23:18.322 --> 23:25.864
and look around and you feel the silence

23:26.922 --> 23:33.526
of this state that, now, you are the king.

23:34.799 --> 23:42.159
This silence is the sign that you are
definitely, definitely,

23:42.360 --> 23:51.833
you are now in contact with the Divine.

23:52.034 --> 23:57.322
You are silent because the Divine is going
to look after everything.

23:59.199 --> 24:03.205
You don’t have to do anything: just
keep silent.

24:03.406 --> 24:07.809
But not forcibly. It’s, again, a state.

24:08.584 --> 24:12.975
You see, if any turmoil takes place,
any problem takes place,

24:13.176 --> 24:18.360
suddenly your attention will jump onto
that silence,

24:19.104 --> 24:22.763
and once you jump onto that silence

24:22.964 --> 24:27.152
you [are] being in contact with this
whole All-pervading Power.

24:27.353 --> 24:33.524
And when I talk about All-pervading Power
we still don’t understand what it is,

24:33.725 --> 24:37.149
what it means, this All-pervading Power
of love.

24:37.350 --> 24:41.148
Is it some sort of an energy floating
around?

24:41.349 --> 24:52.085
Or is it some sort of a river? Or some sort
of a ether?

24:55.859 --> 25:06.718
It is the complete, the totality
of Reality.

25:07.771 --> 25:15.367
Complete totality of Reality, is this
All-pervading Power.

25:15.568 --> 25:19.352
Other things are unreal.

25:22.145 --> 25:27.053
And the Reality is so efficient…

25:37.589 --> 25:43.343
It is so efficient, It never fails,
like this mic.

25:50.165 --> 26:00.388
It’s such a tremendous, we can call –
the intertwined process;

26:00.845 --> 26:10.119
which we cannot even imagine with this
human understanding,

26:11.913 --> 26:15.833
how It controls, how It works.

26:17.744 --> 26:23.338
I mean, for example [if] you see the trees.

26:23.539 --> 26:29.472
The rose bush will give roses only,
it won’t give apples.

26:29.673 --> 26:36.140
It will grow up to a certain height,
it won’t grow like a coconut tree.

26:36.568 --> 26:48.495
All the characters of this nature is
maintained, nourished, looked after,

26:48.696 --> 26:57.415
controlled absolutely, at the right time,
at the right seasons -

26:57.616 --> 27:01.520
that’s why in Sanskrit this is called
as ‘Rutambhara Pragya’.

27:01.721 --> 27:08.680
‘Rutu’ means seasons, and the One which
looks after the seasons,

27:08.881 --> 27:15.392
that knowledge which is enlightened:
simple definition.

27:15.593 --> 27:19.941
But still it doesn’t explain,

27:20.142 --> 27:28.104
because it is so complicated for a human
brain

27:28.305 --> 27:32.445
that they cannot understand how it works.

27:32.646 --> 27:36.446
Now all the miracles you have described
I’ve seen.

27:36.647 --> 27:41.144
I mean, there are so many still to be
recorded.

27:42.701 --> 27:46.966
Is just a play of this Power

27:47.167 --> 27:55.358
which thinks, understands, co-operates,
co-ordinates and loves

27:57.421 --> 28:05.543
and looks after you. [It] is at your
disposal, at your disposal.

28:05.744 --> 28:10.206
Wherever you go the connection is
maintained.

28:10.407 --> 28:15.176
It’s like a governor travelling, you see,
the security travels with him.

28:15.377 --> 28:18.605
So they are all around.

28:18.946 --> 28:24.915
Not only with Me but with you also.

28:26.082 --> 28:31.469
You are already booked there.

28:31.781 --> 28:35.708
And They know you are the one they have
to look after,

28:35.909 --> 28:39.006
They won’t look after anybody else,

28:39.207 --> 28:42.747
They won’t do anything for anybody else
but for you people.

28:42.948 --> 28:45.522
Now try to understand the self-esteem part.

28:45.723 --> 28:49.553
You are Sahaja Yogis, means you are
such special people

28:49.754 --> 28:56.239
that this Divine Power, wherever you may be,
whether you are sleeping, you are walking

28:56.440 --> 29:02.956
or you are sitting under the tree or
in your house, wherever you are,

29:03.157 --> 29:09.625
that connection is maintained. Like a
talkie-walkie you can call it, at the most.

29:09.826 --> 29:12.916
But you don’t have to talk, you don’t have
to say anything,

29:13.117 --> 29:17.492
you don’t have to command, you don’t have
to request,

29:17.693 --> 29:22.476
nothing - it is at your disposal.

29:24.677 --> 29:30.609
Because already you are one
of the governors in the Realm of God.

29:30.810 --> 29:36.193
So all the protocol, that is yours. Anybody
who tries to insult you or trouble you

29:36.394 --> 29:42.582
has to pay for that kind of an action.
So you should never worry.

29:42.783 --> 29:47.475
You should never think of those things
on the mundane level.

29:47.676 --> 29:50.240
On the contrary I would say, better
forgive,

29:50.441 --> 29:55.206
because God knows what will happen to that
person who misbehaves.

29:55.407 --> 30:02.954
It is not only compassion, also It is
wrathful,

30:03.899 --> 30:06.355
It is wrathful.

30:07.313 --> 30:15.784
You are special people; only thing [is]
you have to have your self-esteem

30:15.985 --> 30:25.135
and you must try to maintain your balance.

30:26.435 --> 30:32.599
Once you come in balance, the job of
a Guru is to give balance to others.

30:32.800 --> 30:36.717
It balances everything. It will balance
the nature,

30:36.918 --> 30:41.498
climate, atmosphere, society, human beings.

30:41.699 --> 30:45.131
It is there to balance you.

30:48.730 --> 30:54.528
And that balance comes from the Guru
Principle which balances you.

30:54.729 --> 31:01.030
If you have Guru Principle in you, you get
into balance – automatically!

31:02.599 --> 31:05.788
Automatically you become a balanced
personality.

31:05.989 --> 31:10.888
Nobody has to tell you, “Now you balance,”
you are balanced.

31:11.993 --> 31:16.165
So now, how do we develop that balance?

31:20.863 --> 31:27.328
Of course in the ancient times they had
very severe methods –

31:27.545 --> 31:32.466
is not to eat much, to starve yourself

31:32.667 --> 31:37.167
and go to Himalayas, stand on your heads
and do all kinds of things.

31:37.368 --> 31:42.325
This will bring great imbalance.

31:42.526 --> 31:49.021
If you become an austere personality
it will make you such a dry person

31:49.222 --> 31:55.416
that nobody would like to stand near you;
I mean, you’ll be burning, absolutely.

31:55.617 --> 32:01.185
So the ascetic ideas, I don’t know from
where it has come, whatever it has come.

32:01.386 --> 32:08.332
Maybe because they wanted people to pay
more attention to their Spirit.

32:09.269 --> 32:16.027
But a Guru is not ascetic by nature.

32:17.237 --> 32:20.991
But he is so detached that he is ascetic.

32:21.192 --> 32:25.775
He may be the king or he may be a beggar

32:25.976 --> 32:29.906
or he may be a big personality somewhere

32:30.107 --> 32:33.887
or he may be just an ordinary person.

32:34.088 --> 32:44.771
If he is a Guru then in every state he is
in complete balance.

32:46.330 --> 32:48.969
Nothing can disturb him.

32:49.170 --> 32:56.831
Supposing you put a crown on his head –
so what?

32:57.032 --> 33:05.922
Whether it is a cardboard crown, silver
or gold or diamonds or anything,

33:06.123 --> 33:14.501
it can never impress him and he can never
go into imbalances.

33:23.658 --> 33:30.271
Food for example; food is one of the weak
points, I think.

33:31.391 --> 33:39.551
A Guru who might eat quite a lot, he may
not eat at all;

33:41.110 --> 33:48.139
may like something to eat, something not
to eat, whatever it is.

33:49.079 --> 33:55.703
But nothing can dominate this Guru.

33:56.318 --> 34:03.315
So the symptom is that you are in balance

34:03.516 --> 34:09.319
and you cannot be dominated by food
or by power

34:09.520 --> 34:16.035
or by wealth or money or anything – nothing
can dominate you.

34:18.054 --> 34:21.279
You are above all these things.

34:22.444 --> 34:28.112
And once you know that you are above
these things,

34:29.960 --> 34:34.838
then you are not afraid. No more you
are afraid.

34:35.039 --> 34:41.617
Fearlessness comes into you, you become
absolutely fearless.

34:43.390 --> 34:50.503
Nothing can, nothing can put you
into imbalance;

34:50.704 --> 34:57.379
nothing can dominate you; nothing can
weaken you;

34:57.580 --> 35:06.071
nothing can make you an addict; nothing
is tempting.

35:08.812 --> 35:13.841
There’s nothing like temptation left
anymore.

35:15.920 --> 35:20.865
When you reach that state, beyond
temptation,

35:21.634 --> 35:26.266
beyond any greed, beyond any lust,

35:28.155 --> 35:38.906
then there is no problem;

35:39.107 --> 35:44.873
nothing, nothing can really bring you down.

35:47.846 --> 35:57.070
You may wear an ordinary tulsi [Indian
basil] garland, or you may wear

36:00.493 --> 36:04.323
pearls, or diamonds, or anything.

36:06.410 --> 36:13.130
That doesn’t touch you. But you don’t run
away from anything.

36:13.331 --> 36:17.638
Because when you run away from something
you become an ascetic artificially.

36:17.839 --> 36:22.477
Asceticism is within yourself – innate.

36:23.882 --> 36:29.191
So nothing can hamper you, nothing can
matter.

36:33.507 --> 36:40.269
That state we have to see. But mostly what
happens with people [is]

36:40.470 --> 36:44.172
they’ll say, “Mother, I don’t think I’m
a Guru.” I said, “Why?”

36:44.373 --> 36:48.091
“Because what symptom you told me,
all they are there.

36:48.292 --> 36:52.342
I still want to eat this food, I still -
this thing.”

36:52.543 --> 36:55.966
You are going the other way round.

36:57.675 --> 37:01.416
You shouldn’t try to weigh upon what
I’m telling you

37:01.617 --> 37:06.865
or try to judge yourself. Don’t judge.

37:07.199 --> 37:12.259
You just gradually rise - appreciate
yourself.

37:13.450 --> 37:22.865
And gradually you rise and settle down
on the position that you have achieved.

37:23.066 --> 37:32.125
Instead of that you’ll feel very diffident
and you’ll feel very much depressed

37:32.326 --> 37:36.335
if you start judging, “Oh, Mother has said
that we must have this,

37:36.536 --> 37:39.830
Mother has said we must have this.”

37:42.111 --> 37:49.598
If you all the time start judging yourself,
this will not help you.

37:49.799 --> 37:57.054
You are self-assured! You are sure about
yourself.

37:57.300 --> 38:03.766
There’s nothing to judge yourself
or to tally.

38:03.967 --> 38:09.702
Sometimes I see some people go on saying,
“Mother said so.”

38:10.797 --> 38:13.551
I might have said, might not have said,
out of reference,

38:13.752 --> 38:20.958
whatever it is. What is it? Now, I have
said so. What are you saying?

38:24.433 --> 38:27.079
Because this is a very good way
of troubling others:

38:27.280 --> 38:31.041
“Mother said so.” “What did she say?”

38:31.242 --> 38:38.512
“That you should not take your food
every day.” I never said it.

38:38.805 --> 38:42.866
But somebody can start something like
that, stupid.

38:43.582 --> 38:47.915
Supposing even if I’ve said it – doesn’t
matter – what do you have to say?

38:48.116 --> 38:57.451
So you even out-grow, into your own
experience, what is good.

38:57.652 --> 39:02.709
You wouldn’t believe that I, as a human
being I’m useless.

39:02.910 --> 39:05.302
Really, it was very difficult.

39:05.503 --> 39:08.329
Actually my Father used to tell me so many
things about human beings.

39:08.530 --> 39:12.792
What sort of a things they are and how
I should appear.

39:12.993 --> 39:17.472
And it’s very difficult to be a human
being, very, very difficult.

39:18.195 --> 39:20.762
First I didn’t know why the reactions are
like this,

39:20.963 --> 39:25.758
why people behave like this and what to do
with them, how to manage them.

39:25.959 --> 39:33.442
It’s quite difficult. You can say even
William Blake had the same problem.

39:33.986 --> 39:38.407
But when you reach that state,

39:41.059 --> 39:47.084
then you’re just enjoying yourself.

39:48.631 --> 39:53.860
For you, you have a greater enjoyment
than mine.

39:55.507 --> 40:04.321
Because you are already human beings,
so you know about human beings.

40:05.103 --> 40:14.644
And then you see your ascent and it’s much
easier for you to appreciate [that].

40:15.232 --> 40:20.201
For me it is… I don’t know, because I’ve
never known temptations,

40:20.402 --> 40:23.737
I’ve never known all these qualities
that you had,

40:23.938 --> 40:31.575
so I don’t know how to judge what is coming
out of it, you see.

40:32.847 --> 40:37.375
If you don’t have any problems,

40:37.576 --> 40:44.611
if you never had any, say, temptations.

40:46.571 --> 40:50.259
As you were you are – what is so great?

40:50.460 --> 40:57.682
But from something human you have come
to a higher level,

40:57.966 --> 41:04.362
is very creditable. And you can enjoy
much more than I could enjoy

41:04.563 --> 41:10.806
or Christ could enjoy or Shri Krishna
could enjoy.

41:15.776 --> 41:23.261
Because the one who has risen, has grown,

41:23.462 --> 41:30.041
now feels the fragrance of his virtues
and qualities and greatness;

41:30.242 --> 41:33.252
then he enjoys himself.

41:34.252 --> 41:42.066
“So what? I’m sitting here,” he’ll say,
“all right, I’m sitting here,

41:42.267 --> 41:46.908
why are you bothered? I’m all right!”

41:50.906 --> 42:05.103
To him a proper understanding of this
change comes.

42:06.269 --> 42:10.877
And he understands other human beings
much better

42:11.078 --> 42:18.922
who don’t have your capacity, your
knowledge, your depth, your gravity.

42:19.123 --> 42:23.697
Because you have been a human being.
Now you are Divine.

42:23.898 --> 42:32.480
Because you have been a human being,
you understand other people.

42:32.935 --> 42:40.767
So a Guru like me, I don’t know,

42:44.674 --> 42:49.793
it’s a very different situation here
because I’m a Mother

42:50.695 --> 42:58.300
and I have seen these Gurus, the real Gurus;
they are very harsh people, I must say.

42:58.501 --> 43:02.875
I couldn’t understand how they beat people,
how they thrash them,

43:03.076 --> 43:06.378
they hang them on the well, do all kinds
of things;

43:06.579 --> 43:10.702
I couldn’t understand why do they do it.

43:11.032 --> 43:16.826
But they have come out from the human
level, with struggles and fights,

43:17.059 --> 43:20.570
so they think that, “Why should others
get it so easily?

43:20.771 --> 43:23.351
Why not they also have the problem?”

43:23.552 --> 43:26.598
But you didn’t get it on to all these
problems.

43:26.799 --> 43:29.845
You are different from those gurus.

43:30.046 --> 43:36.213
You got it sahaj. In a very simple manner,
you didn’t do anything.

43:36.414 --> 43:43.046
Sahaj you got it, absolutely sahaj. You
didn’t do anything about it.

43:44.319 --> 43:50.022
So your role as a guru is different from
those gurus

43:50.223 --> 43:55.274
who struggled so much to become a evolved
soul.

43:56.099 --> 44:00.072
So your attitude towards things

44:00.273 --> 44:07.480
has to be more compassionate, more
understanding,

44:07.681 --> 44:13.419
more loving. As you got it sahaj,
others can also get it from you.

44:13.620 --> 44:18.795
You don’t have to do something horrible,
you don’t have to shout at them.

44:18.996 --> 44:22.858
Some people who met me told me,
and which is very sad,

44:23.059 --> 44:25.868
that some sahaja yogis said something
harsh to them

44:26.069 --> 44:28.871
so they had to leave Sahaja Yoga.

44:29.072 --> 44:35.404
A sahaja yogi should never say anything
harsh to anyone; he has no right to say.

44:36.726 --> 44:40.037
Because without saying anything to you,
you got your realisation,

44:40.247 --> 44:45.609
absolutely free. Without doing anything
you have got your realisation

44:45.810 --> 44:48.729
and if somebody is coming to you
for realisation

44:48.930 --> 44:52.555
you must do in the same manner.

44:52.756 --> 45:04.300
You didn’t get it through some sort of
a austere, austere - we can say - training.

45:04.673 --> 45:07.506
So this attitude must be changed.

45:07.707 --> 45:11.439
And I’ve seen that if you have this
attitude

45:11.640 --> 45:15.526
then you could be a guru, but not sahaj.

45:17.244 --> 45:23.176
So now try to understand that there is
a difference between a sahaja guru

45:23.377 --> 45:31.305
and a non-sahaj guru. They are very
hot-tempered, very.

45:31.733 --> 45:37.565
And a sahaj guru has no business to be
hot-tempered.

45:42.859 --> 45:47.184
Everything so nice, so beautiful we have,

45:47.385 --> 45:54.064
all enjoying this beautiful atmosphere.

45:54.265 --> 45:59.340
Such love, such compassion, such respect
for each other.

45:59.541 --> 46:03.553
No competition, no politics.

46:06.653 --> 46:11.711
Just if you understand one thing that you
have got everything in sahaj manner,

46:11.912 --> 46:15.841
and in the same sahaj manner you can
give it to others

46:16.042 --> 46:23.095
and you’ll respect others [in] the same
manner, I think you’ll be able to…

46:23.296 --> 46:25.788
[There’s a gentleman who’s taking
photographs, see who he is,

46:25.989 --> 46:29.468
he is not supposed to take photographs
of all these things.

46:35.879 --> 46:39.146
Without permission he should not take.

46:46.689 --> 46:50.094
(Marathi: get the film reel from them).

46:55.246 --> 46:58.285
(Marathi: get the film reel from them).

47:00.180 --> 47:03.482
These are mischievous people, you know].

47:16.307 --> 47:20.346
So now we are in a sahaj style.

47:20.547 --> 47:26.672
You all know that you’ve got all
the powers, that you are all gurus,

47:26.873 --> 47:31.987
that you have achieved so much, you can
do so much.

47:32.637 --> 47:36.410
Then you have to be sahaj.
You got it sahaj,

47:36.611 --> 47:44.242
so you have no business to be harsh,
horrible, hot-tempered or strict gurus.

47:44.443 --> 47:47.317
But it crawls up. I’ve seen sometimes

47:47.518 --> 47:51.328
quite a lot of military business starts
in Sahaja Yoga also:

47:51.529 --> 47:57.163
military sort of treatment. That cannot be.

47:57.618 --> 48:03.455
No disciplining is needed. They’ll be
disciplined by themselves.

48:03.656 --> 48:07.310
They are gurus, who can discipline a guru?

48:07.511 --> 48:14.984
And then they are sahaj. So your style
is very different.

48:17.091 --> 48:20.782
None of these gurus knew how to even
give realisation.

48:20.983 --> 48:23.987
I’m telling you frankly.

48:24.780 --> 48:29.630
They never knew that Kundalini can rise
with their hands.

48:29.831 --> 48:36.910
Very few people historically have given
realisation – so far.

48:37.111 --> 48:41.176
But you people are giving left and right
to anybody who comes, sit down.

48:41.377 --> 48:44.189
Just now I said, “All right, come along,
look at this person”.

48:44.390 --> 48:47.230
So all of you sit down, “Now, this is it,
this is it.”

48:47.431 --> 48:53.036
You have crossed the limits of science now.
You have become science yourself

48:53.237 --> 48:55.831
of the Divine and you know each and
everything about it,

48:56.032 --> 49:00.507
“This chakra is catching, that is catching,
I’m catching, you are catching.”

49:00.708 --> 49:05.442
But the way we deal with others is
the guru pada:

49:06.917 --> 49:11.157
kindness, sweetness, concern.

49:11.358 --> 49:18.160
That’s what your Mother has given you -
concern.

49:24.003 --> 49:31.875
The concern that flows; about each
and every person.

49:32.349 --> 49:35.757
You have to have concern.

49:35.958 --> 49:44.547
But these gurus: “Now you go!” They’ll
[say]: “Die, kill yourself! Eat grass.”

49:47.213 --> 49:49.807
No, not that way.

49:51.792 --> 49:57.315
So you also have to be a motherly guru,

49:59.628 --> 50:06.865
a sweet guru, extremely sweet, kindly

50:09.922 --> 50:14.762
and understanding, forgiving.

50:16.424 --> 50:23.995
Because what is the purpose? What is
the purpose?

50:24.196 --> 50:27.408
The purpose is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

50:27.609 --> 50:30.849
That’s the main thing we miss out:
that the purpose

50:31.050 --> 50:33.554
of our realisation or of our birth

50:33.755 --> 50:38.054
is to give realisations to others,
to spread Sahaja Yoga,

50:38.255 --> 50:42.023
to emancipate others, by that to emancipate
the whole world.

50:42.192 --> 50:49.241
It’s our responsibility. If you are
responsible then how do you behave?

50:52.315 --> 50:56.633
So no more we have priesthood, no more.

50:56.834 --> 50:59.324
Nor that one person says so,

50:59.525 --> 51:03.411
that person says so, this has happened -
nothing of the kind.

51:03.612 --> 51:08.224
What you have to say, you say it
to that person.

51:08.425 --> 51:12.488
And you yourself will see how you are
reflecting

51:12.689 --> 51:16.348
your personality on another person,

51:16.896 --> 51:23.033
how he reacts and he, how he behaves.

51:23.234 --> 51:28.325
Gradually I’ve seen our collectivity
is learning all this.

51:28.526 --> 51:32.509
Gradually I find all those horrible
dominating people

51:32.710 --> 51:35.309
have run away from Sahaja Yoga.

51:35.510 --> 51:42.557
Also I find that people are extremely
loving

51:42.884 --> 51:48.802
and kindly to each other and also
to others.

51:49.889 --> 51:55.562
Because you are embodiment of goodness,
embodiment of righteousness,

51:55.763 --> 52:02.452
you are embodiment of patience,
compassion, love and concern.

52:06.169 --> 52:13.240
So it is not how you can do it, you are
already.

52:14.074 --> 52:21.262
But you shouldn’t just give up. I said,
“Just look at something and watch.”

52:21.463 --> 52:25.237
Nobody can do that, but you all can do it.

52:26.364 --> 52:33.776
So the self-esteem, and then assumption.
Assume your powers.

52:35.853 --> 52:40.904
If you are a guru, then assume your power.

52:41.294 --> 52:47.793
You do not assume your power.
You still think,

52:48.499 --> 52:52.911
“God knows if I have the powers or not”,
this, that.

52:53.112 --> 53:00.137
That means you are just a beginner still.
“No, I’m the guru, all right.”

53:02.804 --> 53:06.613
We do say, “Mother, I’m my own guru,”
that’s all.

53:06.814 --> 53:09.361
But is just saying from the lips.

53:09.562 --> 53:14.660
Not only that you are your own guru
but of the whole world.

53:16.472 --> 53:23.130
It’s a collective ‘gurudom’ we have,
I should say collective.

53:23.331 --> 53:29.666
And nothing can escape us now, we are
formidable, absolutely formidable.

53:29.867 --> 53:32.871
Nothing can escape us.

53:34.726 --> 53:45.473
If this is understood that we have
to assume.

53:45.910 --> 53:50.818
Here now, they elect somebody who is
a very cruel man,

53:51.019 --> 53:57.850
put some clothes on him and say he is
the pope. All right, he’s the pope.

53:58.051 --> 54:00.776
But he is not!

54:01.649 --> 54:06.246
He is just acting, but inside he is not.

54:06.447 --> 54:12.246
That he is infallible - he is fallible!
100 times.

54:14.362 --> 54:19.998
That is not with us. We have all these
things within ourselves.

54:20.215 --> 54:27.141
We’ve got them, they are there, we are the
possessors of that, only thing you assume.

54:27.342 --> 54:30.908
Once you start assuming, all badhas will
run away, everything will run away

54:31.109 --> 54:35.730
and you’ll be surprised. Who can stand
a person

54:35.931 --> 54:39.112
who is a saint, who is a guru and who
knows he is a guru?

54:39.313 --> 54:43.090
Nobody can stand. They’ll run away.

54:45.888 --> 54:51.425
But you have to have introspection

54:51.626 --> 54:59.573
to see that your self-esteem is completely
correct.

54:59.774 --> 55:03.430
It’s not just [that] you are thinking
you are a guru.

55:04.810 --> 55:10.973
I have known some real gurus and I would
never allow you to go to them

55:11.174 --> 55:16.887
because God knows if you can come back
in one piece or not.

55:18.196 --> 55:23.963
And I’ve told them, that they are real
gurus, I know, but don’t go near them.

55:25.545 --> 55:30.836
Because what they lack is this compassion,
this sahaj style.

55:31.037 --> 55:33.264
Because they think they have worked
very hard,

55:33.465 --> 55:37.479
so why should these people not work
very hard.

55:40.277 --> 55:46.925
You may be anything. You can be doing
this work, that work.

55:47.126 --> 55:51.262
You may be educated, not educated,
makes no difference.

55:51.463 --> 55:56.405
Whether you are rich, poor, makes
no difference at all,

55:59.085 --> 56:05.549
as long as you know that you are the guru
and you assume your power.

56:05.750 --> 56:13.551
In that assumption as if any talent, if you
know music, you know you know music.

56:14.192 --> 56:17.777
If you know how to cook, you know
how to cook.

56:18.586 --> 56:20.876
If you are an administrator and if you know
administration,

56:21.077 --> 56:27.770
you know administration. But that could be
also not totally absolute.

56:27.971 --> 56:34.664
But you are already Absolute Totality
of Reality.

56:34.865 --> 56:40.193
The Reality is at your disposal. But you
assume it!

56:40.394 --> 56:43.733
You are not ordinary at all.

56:43.934 --> 56:48.402
We can say you are extraordinary
in ordinary.

56:51.936 --> 57:00.021
In that you will just drop out all that
is nonsensical, you’ll just drop out.

57:01.876 --> 57:09.241
Others will see you and will be surprised:
what sort of people these are.

57:09.833 --> 57:16.862
What sort of a life they lead, how nice
they are, how kind they are.

57:17.063 --> 57:20.129
And the knowledge is so subtle and so
great

57:20.330 --> 57:28.294
and of such a highest degree. But you never
feel bloated up with ego.

57:28.495 --> 57:31.970
I have not seen any sahaja yogi who says,
“Oh, I know all about chakras,

57:32.171 --> 57:38.360
this and that. How dare you say like that!”
With the moustaches upward.

57:41.089 --> 57:45.765
No! With all this knowledge you bend down

57:45.966 --> 57:50.542
like the tree which is laden with fruits
bends down.

57:51.034 --> 57:56.722
And that humility, that simplicity and that
humility

57:56.923 --> 58:08.101
gives you the special edge which can
pierce into any heart.

58:10.312 --> 58:15.669
Thus you became apostles of Truth.

58:15.870 --> 58:22.020
You can become prophets like William Blake.
You can.

58:23.495 --> 58:29.892
So many things you’ll be manifesting
and you won’t believe yourself.

58:35.928 --> 58:38.958
But believe,

58:39.159 --> 58:48.536
you are one with that Great Power which
is God Almighty.

58:48.737 --> 58:57.452
They were discussing for ages I think,
about the immaculate conception of Christ.

58:57.653 --> 59:05.908
Such stupid people I’ve never seen.
But He is God!

59:06.217 --> 59:13.527
He is God Almighty, He is not a human
being! He can do anything!

59:18.859 --> 59:27.577
How can you judge Him? And judge
His powers and His working, how can you?

59:27.778 --> 59:32.768
To discuss about God, have you got
His brains?

59:33.824 --> 59:39.599
I mean, it’s something, a person like me
discussing about banking.

59:43.308 --> 59:49.755
Say, I - after say one or two sentences
I go off.

59:51.123 --> 59:55.454
In the same way, when you start
discussing God,

59:55.655 --> 01:00:04.318
you must know you do not have that capacity
to discuss about God,

01:00:04.519 --> 01:00:09.822
what His relations are, how He got a son,
this and that.

01:00:10.023 --> 01:00:19.618
Who are you? What’s your own position
that you can discuss?

01:00:22.432 --> 01:00:27.565
And then in that humility you realise:
He’s God Almighty.

01:00:28.683 --> 01:00:38.004
He’s Almighty. He can do anything!

01:00:39.039 --> 01:00:44.672
Then that faith, not blind,

01:00:44.873 --> 01:00:52.202
but a real faith in that feeling that God
is Almighty

01:00:52.638 --> 01:00:57.007
and that now you have become the messenger
of that God Almighty,

01:00:57.208 --> 01:01:04.715
gives you all the strength, all
the courage, everything.

01:01:05.742 --> 01:01:12.893
And His compassion, His love, His attention
and His understanding.

01:01:13.094 --> 01:01:21.170
So this faith should be absolutely one
with you.

01:01:21.741 --> 01:01:27.170
Once I went to meet one real guru.
Oh, he was a very horrid fellow otherwise!

01:01:27.371 --> 01:01:31.766
He has slapped so many people, thrown
so many people down from the hills

01:01:31.967 --> 01:01:34.598
and all that kinds of things he has done,
no doubt.

01:01:34.799 --> 01:01:40.759
But still for me he has tremendous regards.
I went to him,

01:01:41.425 --> 01:01:46.312
so he just started talking to me as if he
would talk to a Goddess.

01:01:46.513 --> 01:01:49.094
He said, “How do you find these worldly
people here?”

01:01:49.295 --> 01:01:53.370
I said, “All right, after all I have
created them.”

01:01:59.457 --> 01:02:02.598
“Ah but,” he said, “Still but, you are God,

01:02:02.807 --> 01:02:07.352
with your power why don’t you change
them a little bit?”

01:02:08.114 --> 01:02:11.990
I said, “That’s what is the problem. I have
given them freedom.

01:02:12.191 --> 01:02:17.019
I’ve said, ‘All right, it’s freedom to you.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:23.854
You can choose if you want to get
transformed or not,’ I cannot force.”

01:02:24.055 --> 01:02:29.003
He said, “But God Almighty you are,
you can do anything.”

01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:34.811
I said, “I can do everything, but I do not
want to do certain things;

01:02:35.018 --> 01:02:41.635
and one of them is to take away the freedom
from them.

01:02:41.836 --> 01:02:44.697
That is their freedom to choose.

01:02:44.898 --> 01:02:48.239
That’s given to them because, if they have
to have the ultimate freedom,

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:52.320
they should have their, this little freedom
intact.”

01:02:54.449 --> 01:03:00.304
So he was quarrelling with me about this.
He said, “But when you are God Almighty

01:03:00.505 --> 01:03:06.845
there could be some other method!
These horrible people, what to do?”

01:03:07.908 --> 01:03:15.858
I said, “Your concern is all right and I
understand because you are a guru,

01:03:16.059 --> 01:03:23.328
but when I’m God Almighty supposing,
then my style is different.

01:03:23.529 --> 01:03:32.013
I can’t be like you.” Then he said,
“That’s true. You can’t be like me.”

01:03:33.556 --> 01:03:36.510
That is what I found in him.

01:03:36.711 --> 01:03:43.645
He was talking to me only as if I’m God
standing before him.

01:03:46.928 --> 01:03:51.950
And then see, he told all the disciples,
“You see, you praise, you praise the Lord,

01:03:52.151 --> 01:03:59.948
you praise Her, ‘suti kara’, because God
is fond of praise.”

01:04:00.774 --> 01:04:04.494
I said, “Really?” “Yes!

01:04:04.994 --> 01:04:08.423
If you praise the Lord then He gives you
everything, I’ve seen that.

01:04:08.624 --> 01:04:12.887
I always praise Him. Whenever I want
something to be done

01:04:13.088 --> 01:04:16.417
I just praise Him and He does it for me.”

01:04:18.203 --> 01:04:26.117
So, I said, “It’s true, I must accept.”
Because He’s bhakti gamya.

01:04:26.569 --> 01:04:32.292
You cannot get to Mother unless and until
you have really bhakti from your heart.

01:04:32.501 --> 01:04:40.656
Is all already sort of a built-in
restriction. What can I do?

01:04:40.857 --> 01:04:45.932
If you don’t have bhakti you cannot get
to Mother, no, you cannot.

01:04:46.133 --> 01:04:48.825
You cannot get to God.

01:04:49.587 --> 01:04:58.208
But if you have bhakti, then you can get
to Mother. Is written “bhakti gamya”.

01:04:58.844 --> 01:05:02.432
If somebody says, “All right. Raise
my Kundalini!”

01:05:02.633 --> 01:05:04.923
I cannot raise his Kundalini, not
[only that]

01:05:05.124 --> 01:05:09.194
but for seven lives he won’t have
realisation!

01:05:09.395 --> 01:05:15.822
But if somebody says, “Mother, will you
please give me realisation?” Once!

01:05:16.242 --> 01:05:23.011
So not only humility but bhakti. And bhakti
is only possible if you have your faith.

01:05:23.212 --> 01:05:26.910
That’s the thing is the faith, which is
challenged nowadays

01:05:27.111 --> 01:05:31.245
by all kinds of stupid people;
intellectuals, these horrible people

01:05:31.446 --> 01:05:35.001
who are taking out yarns out of their head,
or also by science

01:05:35.202 --> 01:05:40.816
and this so-called ‘Catholic Church’ and
this Church and that Church.

01:05:43.767 --> 01:05:54.482
So your faith in God has to be absolutely,
absolutely untarnishable.

01:05:54.683 --> 01:06:00.997
Nothing can disturb that. That’s very
important.

01:06:01.316 --> 01:06:03.613
You have seen all the miracles of God,

01:06:03.814 --> 01:06:10.503
you have seen how you’re working out
His powers,

01:06:10.704 --> 01:06:18.682
you have known all these things. But still
the faith in God is missing.

01:06:18.890 --> 01:06:23.383
The person who has complete faith in God
is called as the one…

01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:31.012
is God himself they say. Is called
as Paramachaitanya.

01:06:32.045 --> 01:06:42.198
The guru is called as the one who is
himself Brahmachaitanya.

01:06:44.458 --> 01:06:53.455
So when this faith in God is absolutely
established in you

01:06:53.656 --> 01:06:59.518
that, “There is God Almighty, He’s
Almighty,

01:06:59.726 --> 01:07:05.334
and that I am the messenger of that God.”

01:07:05.762 --> 01:07:11.591
Just this understanding, when it becomes
absolutely firm in you,

01:07:11.792 --> 01:07:15.496
then you are in the Gurupada.

01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:19.911
I bless you today that all of you achieve
that state

01:07:20.112 --> 01:07:24.901
that you reside in that Gurupada state.

01:07:25.102 --> 01:07:33.173
And wherever you are, whatever may be
your position, whatever you may do,

01:07:36.068 --> 01:07:43.372
the faith in the God Almighty that is
so truly within you will express itself.

01:07:43.573 --> 01:07:51.501
Not only [that] but that it will manifest,
it will act; just like God.

01:07:55.929 --> 01:08:01.037
So many things can be said. I’ve said
so many things before.

01:08:01.238 --> 01:08:05.363
And so many can be said later on also;

01:08:05.564 --> 01:08:12.437
but today we have to remember one thing,
that we must have complete faith

01:08:12.638 --> 01:08:17.260
in the Kingdom of God and in the powers
of God Almighty,

01:08:17.461 --> 01:08:23.910
complete faith, and then in ourselves.

01:08:24.676 --> 01:08:27.520
May God bless you all.
