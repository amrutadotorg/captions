00:00:01.912 --> 00:00:06.267
My joy knows no bounds

00:00:06.468 --> 00:00:15.650
when we have come to worship this holy mountain,

00:00:15.851 --> 00:00:18.455
which we have named as Ganaraj.

00:00:53.077 --> 00:00:58.108
Sometimes the words are not sufficient

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.918
to hold the outpour of your joy.

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:21.730
I come to you as a symbol of your Mother,

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:32.882
but the first son who was created. was Shri Ganesha.

00:01:39.394 --> 00:01:44.263
And then, when the Mother Earth was created

00:01:44.464 --> 00:01:47.075
as a symbol of motherhood,

00:01:47.276 --> 00:01:52.218
She created many Shri Ganeshas in this universe.

00:02:05.622 --> 00:02:22.324
In the cosmos, the star which is called as Mars,

00:02:22.525 --> 00:02:24.142
is the Ganesh, Shri Ganesha.

00:02:33.368 --> 00:02:36.403
All these symbols were created

00:02:36.612 --> 00:02:40.213
for you the Sahaja Yogis to recognize them;

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:54.355
to recognize all these symbols

00:02:56.117 --> 00:03:00.538
is easier if you are a realized soul.

00:03:07.144 --> 00:03:16.187
But we have had so many great realized souls in the past,

00:03:22.127 --> 00:03:23.853
of very high quality,

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:30.679
and they recognized, they found out

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.301
the symbols of Shri Ganesha long time back.

00:03:43.627 --> 00:03:48.911
India is the microscopic form of the whole earth, Mother Earth.

00:03:58.883 --> 00:04:01.216
So, in the triangle of Maharashtra

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:07.107
we have got eight Ganeshas which are

00:04:07.308 --> 00:04:10.563
manifesting vibrations, and were recognized

00:04:10.864 --> 00:04:13.079
by great Saints of Maharashtra.

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:33.766
But, as you have seen, as a grace of these great Saints,

00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:39.336
specially Maharashtra has created human beings

00:04:39.537 --> 00:04:45.391
who have shraddha as the highest expression

00:04:45.592 --> 00:04:47.893
of their emotion and mind.

00:05:01.708 --> 00:05:07.197
Because of that lofty vision in the mind,

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:13.377
whenever they see something of this sublime nature,

00:05:13.578 --> 00:05:15.976
their thoughts go to God.

00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:36.430
Thanks to the Saints of that state that people

00:05:36.631 --> 00:05:41.615
have that sensitivity and that kind of a movement.

00:05:56.966 --> 00:06:00.125
Unfortunately in the West,

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:05.513
where shraddha is something very superficial,

00:06:05.714 --> 00:06:14.036
anything like this takes them to something very low,

00:06:15.318 --> 00:06:20.177
something very dirty, filthy, unholy.

00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:54.288
Instead of surrendering to the Sublime,

00:06:54.489 --> 00:06:57.640
and enjoying the greatness of the Sublime,

00:06:57.841 --> 00:07:02.522
they take to something very carnal,

00:07:02.723 --> 00:07:05.355
which belongs to the flesh.

00:07:23.892 --> 00:07:25.868
But still the people who are

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:32.105
living in simple ways in the villages, in the nature,

00:07:32.306 --> 00:07:38.946
must have realized the importance of this holy mountain.

00:07:58.719 --> 00:08:02.211
Thousands and thousands, millions of years back,

00:08:04.032 --> 00:08:09.953
the Mother Earth started producing Her Ganesha.

00:08:17.653 --> 00:08:25.379
It was first a huge ocean where Himalaya stands.

00:08:33.685 --> 00:08:40.204
Himalaya gradually started coming out of that ocean,

00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:48.099
in a flat way, like a Shiva-Linga,

00:08:56.801 --> 00:09:00.868
which is the expression as the manifestation of the animals,

00:09:01.069 --> 00:09:04.069
they have the brains which are flat

00:09:40.056 --> 00:09:41.618
in this way.

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:54.025
But when the Himalayas started coming out of that sea,

00:09:54.226 --> 00:09:57.655
the Mother Earth was pushed on sides,

00:10:08.178 --> 00:10:09.449
and the Mother Earth started

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:12.584
giving folds to Her sari, you can say.

00:10:30.156 --> 00:10:36.675
Now, when that movement started,

00:10:36.876 --> 00:10:43.290
the sari gave waves of vibrations in such a way

00:10:43.491 --> 00:10:46.974
that at certain points it

00:10:47.175 --> 00:10:52.893
rose up to a point becoming like Shri Ganesha.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:24.459
And it was, to begin with, of flat,

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:27.995
again the same types of the ...

00:11:39.093 --> 00:11:43.627
But then, still more folds started coming up, much later,

00:11:43.828 --> 00:11:48.828
when human brain started developing its ego.

00:12:03.365 --> 00:12:07.140
So the whole of that land was pushed up

00:12:07.341 --> 00:12:10.786
and another land joined it in such a manner

00:12:10.987 --> 00:12:13.481
that it formed a apex,

00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.835
pushed it.

00:12:24.539 --> 00:12:30.624
The super-ego was pushed in and was brought to the climax.

00:12:42.393 --> 00:12:45.340
That synchronizes with the human brain,

00:12:45.541 --> 00:12:47.012
because the whole universe

00:12:47.213 --> 00:12:50.814
is represented in our body as well.

00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:11.336
Now, the central axis of the Mother Earth

00:13:11.537 --> 00:13:14.615
acted as the spinal cord.

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:28.660
By this happening in the Himalayas,

00:13:28.861 --> 00:13:35.538
again there was a big push onto all the mountains

00:13:35.739 --> 00:13:38.870
which were to be created as Shri Ganesh

00:13:39.034 --> 00:13:43.927
and they got into their final forms,

00:13:59.568 --> 00:14:01.607
and the apex was created.

00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:14.067
So the Mother Earth as Gauri created all these Ganeshas.

00:14:24.715 --> 00:14:28.013
At the other end of these ranges

00:14:28.214 --> 00:14:32.245
must be the highest mountain because it is pushed the most.

00:14:37.417 --> 00:14:40.284
Mont Blanc should be higher than this one.

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:49.456
You see, when they pushed it,

00:14:49.657 --> 00:14:54.567
Himalaya was brought up to a point, up to a point it went,

00:14:54.768 --> 00:15:00.430
and then the waves created Ganesha of a certain height,

00:15:00.631 --> 00:15:02.219
not too much height.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.782
So it was pushed on the right hand side more:

00:15:04.983 --> 00:15:08.623
the ego went, you see, expression in Mont Blanc,

00:15:08.835 --> 00:15:10.514
you see for example.

00:15:54.379 --> 00:16:02.006
And on the other side, it was created another Ganesha

00:16:02.207 --> 00:16:05.537
at the other end near Darjeeling.

00:16:05.738 --> 00:16:08.670
Shri Mataji, is the Mont Blanc expression of Shri Ganesha also?

00:16:08.871 --> 00:16:11.941
No, no, it is the expression of ego.

00:16:12.142 --> 00:16:15.313
Ego, yes, it's in France.

00:16:34.812 --> 00:16:38.312
So Shri Ganesha was expressed even in Darjeeling,

00:16:38.513 --> 00:16:42.210
and you get the same kind of redness on that.

00:16:51.258 --> 00:16:55.416
I have seen another Shri Ganesh created in Delphi

00:16:55.637 --> 00:17:00.145
where they say is the Nabhi of the Mother Earth.

00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:26.228
Also when Shri Shiva is created, Linga is created,

00:17:26.429 --> 00:17:30.127
along with Him always there is a Shri Ganesha created,

00:17:30.328 --> 00:17:33.415
as in [AMBARNATH], where a drop of water

00:17:33.616 --> 00:17:38.277
falls on a particular area and creates the Linga.

00:17:38.478 --> 00:17:41.683
Plus that, another drop falls on another side

00:17:41.884 --> 00:17:45.298
and creates Shri Ganesh, exactly like the face.

00:18:34.166 --> 00:18:36.621
Now the ocean is the Father,

00:18:36.822 --> 00:18:41.188
and the Mother Earth is your Mother,

00:18:45.632 --> 00:18:48.587
but when the Mother Earth becomes a mountain,

00:18:48.788 --> 00:18:52.142
She is called as the Father.

00:18:52.343 --> 00:18:57.318
The reason is: She, at that height, can catch the Father

00:18:57.519 --> 00:19:01.292
on top of Her head, as snow or as rain.

00:19:24.092 --> 00:19:26.695
That is how a Mother becomes the Father,

00:19:29.669 --> 00:19:32.399
and so She can perform

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:35.600
the complete function of a Father and a Mother.

00:19:41.205 --> 00:19:46.988
In that state only Gauri, the Daughter of the Mountains,

00:19:47.189 --> 00:19:50.414
conceived Shri Ganesha

00:19:50.615 --> 00:19:54.368
without the help of the Father, immaculate.

00:20:06.450 --> 00:20:11.132
The purity of the snow is hundred percent,

00:20:11.333 --> 00:20:13.381
and that covers the Mother Earth,

00:20:13.582 --> 00:20:17.089
gives the formation of Innocence.

00:20:28.513 --> 00:20:32.617
All the filth and dirt that goes into the ocean

00:20:32.818 --> 00:20:37.125
is clarified by the sun, which is also Shri Ganesha,

00:20:37.326 --> 00:20:44.130
and is brought on top of the hills and mountains to cover it.

00:20:45.533 --> 00:20:47.466
Well, this is Divine Ecology.

00:21:24.345 --> 00:21:33.005
But to Ganesh it is a big problem to exist in a country

00:21:33.206 --> 00:21:35.557
which doesn't worship it.

00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:46.171
It has no sense of respect.

00:21:49.724 --> 00:21:58.888
It is always aspired that they should climb over

00:22:07.442 --> 00:22:10.988
with a very egotistical ambitions,

00:22:14.817 --> 00:22:17.529
of a low level and outward.

00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.910
When you see the mountains like this,

00:22:28.111 --> 00:22:36.692
the idea that should come into a good human being would be,

00:22:37.801 --> 00:22:42.538
O God, I can see You in this sublime form,

00:22:42.739 --> 00:22:45.711
and how will I conquer my ignorance?

00:22:45.912 --> 00:22:50.518
How will I climb over my mountain

00:22:50.719 --> 00:22:54.547
of arrogance to look at You?

00:23:27.919 --> 00:23:32.051
To a egotistical mind,

00:23:32.286 --> 00:23:39.547
the mountain is for the joy of the eyes,

00:23:39.748 --> 00:23:42.680
and the joy which is really not the joy,

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:46.474
but is a kind of a pleasure for them to see.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:04.093
Their ego gets challenged

00:24:04.294 --> 00:24:06.601
and they want to climb on the mountain that,

00:24:06.802 --> 00:24:08.294
We are higher than You!

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.211
We had Himalayas for thousands

00:24:20.472 --> 00:24:22.387
and thousands of years in India;

00:24:22.588 --> 00:24:24.880
nobody ever thought of climbing it.

00:24:31.572 --> 00:24:35.204
When the English came, they started it doing it first time.

00:24:41.094 --> 00:24:45.049
Then the French, Portuguese, Spanish,

00:24:45.250 --> 00:24:47.065
all of them all did this

00:24:47.266 --> 00:24:49.432
and the Indians were looking at them bewildered,

00:24:49.633 --> 00:24:51.328
What are they doing?

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.707
Why do they want to climb the mountains?

00:25:04.395 --> 00:25:07.624
Is better to see them from distance

00:25:07.825 --> 00:25:12.465
and adore them, than to climb over them to die.

00:25:21.384 --> 00:25:24.753
But this egotistical mind can go further,

00:25:24.954 --> 00:25:26.941
as in Switzerland it has gone,

00:25:27.142 --> 00:25:30.306
that they try to ski over these mountains,

00:25:30.507 --> 00:25:32.829
take the slopes to go down.

00:25:33.030 --> 00:25:35.514
They go down in any case,

00:25:50.069 --> 00:25:52.110
and they break their legs.

00:25:52.311 --> 00:25:55.922
I told one Sahaja Yogi who wanted to come here for skiing,

00:25:56.123 --> 00:25:59.016
I said, Don't go there, it's not allowed by Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:59.217 --> 00:26:01.342
and he came back with broken legs.

00:26:18.464 --> 00:26:21.325
So every way the games are also such

00:26:21.526 --> 00:26:25.276
that it's just a satisfaction of the ego.

00:26:34.168 --> 00:26:37.421
I can understand small children going over a slide,

00:26:37.622 --> 00:26:42.546
but big old men moving like this for hours together,

00:26:42.747 --> 00:26:44.726
have they no other work to do?

00:26:55.571 --> 00:26:58.003
That shows they have no maturity of any kind,

00:26:58.204 --> 00:27:02.761
they are still stupid children playing with the snow.

00:27:02.962 --> 00:27:05.518
There are the bhoots of all the skiers around,

00:27:05.719 --> 00:27:07.415
I think Shri Mataji is talking to all of us.

00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.401
By all these doings, what happens

00:27:19.602 --> 00:27:24.047
that the holy places become like cemeteries.

00:27:38.957 --> 00:27:42.717
Imagine, instead of putting flowers on Shri Ganesha

00:27:42.918 --> 00:27:45.230
you are putting dead bodies on His Body.

00:27:55.986 --> 00:27:59.702
And, while skiing, putting those hard nails

00:27:59.903 --> 00:28:02.619
into the Body of Shri Ganesh.

00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.660
It's true.

00:28:17.378 --> 00:28:19.810
There is no sense of respect.

00:28:26.662 --> 00:28:30.135
Perhaps we don't respect ourselves, we are not mature enough.

00:28:35.718 --> 00:28:37.474
The first thing that should happen,

00:28:37.675 --> 00:28:40.853
that one folds his hands to Shri Ganesh

00:28:41.054 --> 00:28:42.892
and just sees those things.

00:28:43.093 --> 00:28:46.108
Just this should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:08.777 --> 00:29:11.310
So the innocence has to be developed to have that respect;

00:29:11.511 --> 00:29:14.511
if you are not innocent, you cannot have respect.

00:29:20.399 --> 00:29:22.269
And in the Innocence you don't think

00:29:22.470 --> 00:29:24.199
you are the wisest of all

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.399
and make everybody look like a fool,

00:29:32.848 --> 00:29:36.115
nor do you laugh at others and make fun of them,

00:29:38.544 --> 00:29:41.838
nor do you play games and put people down.

00:29:53.886 --> 00:29:59.207
But what I have seen, even coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:59.408 --> 00:30:00.910
this is the worst part of it,

00:30:01.111 --> 00:30:02.535
I have seen people who play games

00:30:02.736 --> 00:30:04.189
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:14.938 --> 00:30:20.301
They gossip and say all kinds of wrong things

00:30:20.502 --> 00:30:22.502
which I've never said before.

00:30:31.401 --> 00:30:35.778
There was so many kinds of things I hear

00:30:35.979 --> 00:30:40.885
that I'm amazed how Sahaja Yogis are such creators of gossips.

00:30:51.835 --> 00:30:55.360
Is this the way Ganesha would behave towards the Mother?

00:30:59.469 --> 00:31:03.929
That thinking yourself to be great people you say,

00:31:04.130 --> 00:31:07.583
Mother said so, and this happened, and that happened.

00:31:16.478 --> 00:31:19.129
Ego is anti-innocence,

00:31:22.235 --> 00:31:26.271
and that's why this kind of a nonsensical gossip people do,

00:31:26.472 --> 00:31:28.512
which I can't understand, it is so filthy,

00:31:28.713 --> 00:31:30.065
I just can't understand.

00:31:38.676 --> 00:31:42.939
Like there was one lady whom nobody would marry,

00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.075
and there was only one fellow

00:31:45.276 --> 00:31:47.632
who accepted to marry that woman,

00:31:53.908 --> 00:31:55.761
and that's how the marriage took place.

00:31:58.165 --> 00:32:01.690
Now this lady, or perhaps somebody who is like her,

00:32:01.891 --> 00:32:04.760
has spread stories that she was the most beautiful woman,

00:32:04.961 --> 00:32:07.885
everybody wanted to marry her, everybody raised their hands.

00:32:08.086 --> 00:32:10.078
I never asked people to raise their hands.

00:32:10.279 --> 00:32:14.101
It's not like that at all. When I heard it, I was shocked:

00:32:14.302 --> 00:32:16.685
this woman, nobody wanted to marry her.

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.730
There are all kinds of things

00:32:34.931 --> 00:32:37.790
that you have got from your past,

00:32:44.218 --> 00:32:45.975
and you must try to get out of it,

00:32:46.170 --> 00:32:48.178
otherwise you cannot rise high.

00:32:58.664 --> 00:33:04.458
A person who is not innocent cannot worship Shri Ganesh.

00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.798
In His right hand He has got a Parashu, you must know that,

00:33:12.999 --> 00:33:17.537
a terrible instrument, you see, with one stroke

00:33:17.738 --> 00:33:20.339
He takes out your head, like guillotine it is.

00:33:32.848 --> 00:33:36.667
Those who are not innocent, play games, try tricks,

00:33:36.868 --> 00:33:40.610
gossip, indulge in filth, He cuts them out.

00:33:55.301 --> 00:33:57.742
Innocence is a very sharp thing.

00:34:01.762 --> 00:34:03.685
It does not have any compromise,

00:34:03.886 --> 00:34:06.346
which you can see in the life of Christ.

00:34:11.011 --> 00:34:13.011
With His trunk He throws people

00:34:13.179 --> 00:34:15.579
left and right and throws them out.

00:34:24.700 --> 00:34:28.674
He sees for a while, and if people remain still half-baked,

00:34:28.875 --> 00:34:30.900
they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:48.958 --> 00:34:52.116
No one should think that you have got Realization,

00:34:52.317 --> 00:34:56.157
you can be in the Sahaja Yoga

00:34:56.358 --> 00:34:59.270
if you do not take to innocence.

00:35:10.892 --> 00:35:13.368
Innocence gives you complete sincerity,

00:35:16.939 --> 00:35:19.665
and Ganesha is the judge,

00:35:23.158 --> 00:35:26.273
and He is the one who throws you out

00:35:26.474 --> 00:35:31.036
of the periphery like a tangent you get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:35:39.506 --> 00:35:41.196
And when you get out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:41.397 --> 00:35:44.166
you start going down and down and down,

00:35:44.367 --> 00:35:46.994
and then you may develop horrible diseases

00:35:47.195 --> 00:35:48.195
of the Mooladhara chakra.

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.867
Those who are hit by Him are the worst;

00:36:04.059 --> 00:36:06.366
if you have come near Him, be careful.

00:36:17.526 --> 00:36:21.222
Face yourself, see yourself, note yourself.

00:36:27.928 --> 00:36:30.398
Another thing they told Me that some people

00:36:30.599 --> 00:36:32.953
think that they are great Sahaja Yogis

00:36:33.154 --> 00:36:36.482
who contribute nothing to Sahaja Yoga but headaches.

00:36:49.185 --> 00:36:52.166
If some sane Sahaja Yogi starts telling

00:36:52.367 --> 00:36:57.267
the other Sahaja Yogi about something sensible,

00:36:57.468 --> 00:36:59.595
this fellow puts up his right Vishuddhi,

00:36:59.796 --> 00:37:02.243
pressing it hard on him to show that,

00:37:02.444 --> 00:37:05.368
You are talking because your right Vishuddhi is catching,

00:37:05.569 --> 00:37:06.569
very cunning.

00:37:31.561 --> 00:37:35.642
You are not to play games, because you are harming yourself,

00:37:35.843 --> 00:37:37.132
I'm telling you now.

00:37:44.202 --> 00:37:47.704
Those who think they can play with the loopholes

00:37:47.905 --> 00:37:51.296
must know that there's a loop round their neck.

00:38:19.358 --> 00:38:24.782
Like the fallen angels you will go to the greater heights,

00:38:24.983 --> 00:38:29.029
or depths, of mire.

00:38:42.611 --> 00:38:45.392
So try to be honest to yourself.

00:38:56.879 --> 00:39:01.508
Any nation has any problem,

00:39:01.709 --> 00:39:06.474
any sins they have been committing or have committed before,

00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:18.131
should not be any more [a tag] with you.

00:39:24.191 --> 00:39:29.584
If a country has been cunning, then you should be innocent.

00:39:35.766 --> 00:39:41.703
If you are coming from a foxy clan, you have to be innocent.

00:39:47.147 --> 00:39:50.282
Like you are coming from a thuggery clan,

00:39:50.483 --> 00:39:54.068
then you have to be extremely astute.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.571
If you are coming from the romantic clan,

00:40:06.772 --> 00:40:08.750
you have to be extremely pure.

00:40:15.311 --> 00:40:17.189
You have to be juxtaposition

00:40:17.390 --> 00:40:20.272
of whatever sins we are suffering from.

00:40:26.823 --> 00:40:30.349
If you are the light in the darkness,

00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:33.300
you have to be brilliant and not dark,

00:40:37.488 --> 00:40:42.736
and you have to give light in the darkness, to the dark,

00:40:42.937 --> 00:40:45.624
not to take dark upon yourself.

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:56.549
So, if you really feel that the past

00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:58.893
of your country has been such and such,

00:40:59.094 --> 00:41:01.689
you better study it and know for yourself

00:41:01.890 --> 00:41:04.461
that you have to be just different.

00:41:18.938 --> 00:41:22.538
Some are comfort-loving, they should get out of that.

00:41:27.313 --> 00:41:29.922
Some are pleasure-loving, they should get out of that.

00:41:33.266 --> 00:41:38.301
Some are tempted with women and men

00:41:38.502 --> 00:41:39.667
and drinking and all that,

00:41:39.868 --> 00:41:42.571
you should completely give up and come out of it.

00:41:52.782 --> 00:41:55.472
There are deeper sins we have of cunningness,

00:41:55.673 --> 00:41:58.501
of aggressiveness, of slyness,

00:41:58.702 --> 00:42:03.626
all these thing are to be studied and understood

00:42:03.827 --> 00:42:06.274
that what do we have to do for our country

00:42:06.475 --> 00:42:09.118
is to get out of it completely first of all,

00:42:09.319 --> 00:42:11.366
like the lotus out of the mire.

00:42:30.299 --> 00:42:32.708
If your country is racist,

00:42:32.909 --> 00:42:35.549
then you have to become absolutely

00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:38.276
a person completely integrated.

00:42:47.872 --> 00:42:51.067
Like that you have to be on the [JUXTAPOSITION]

00:42:51.288 --> 00:42:54.447
to rise higher than the rest of them

00:42:54.648 --> 00:42:57.765
to give them a proper lead.

00:43:07.539 --> 00:43:12.635
I can tell you that Shiva tolerates lot of nonsense,

00:43:12.836 --> 00:43:17.718
because he is fond of forgiving,

00:43:27.523 --> 00:43:30.572
and Vishnu principle tries to play with them

00:43:30.773 --> 00:43:33.444
and punish them or kill them.

00:43:41.498 --> 00:43:46.743
But Ganesha Tattwa has no compromise of any kind,

00:43:52.464 --> 00:43:55.295
and when this become Ekadesha Rudra,

00:43:55.496 --> 00:43:58.284
and when Christ is going to come in that form,

00:43:58.504 --> 00:44:01.504
then there will be no compromise, no Mataji,

00:44:01.715 --> 00:44:04.284
no crying, no argument, nothing;

00:44:22.677 --> 00:44:26.450
Shri Ganesha Himself will throw people into hell.

00:44:31.439 --> 00:44:32.886
So be careful on that!

00:44:33.087 --> 00:44:35.231
Today, in the Presence of Shri Ganesha,

00:44:35.432 --> 00:44:37.281
you have to take an oath that,

00:44:37.482 --> 00:44:40.098
Whatever is the past of my country,

00:44:40.299 --> 00:44:43.533
I will get opposite to that.

00:44:58.969 --> 00:45:02.924
Like I would say Indians are not very good with the money;

00:45:03.125 --> 00:45:05.432
money matters they can be very horrid,

00:45:05.633 --> 00:45:10.296
and sometimes they create a problem with money matters.

00:45:10.516 --> 00:45:12.260
So, one has to know that we have to be

00:45:12.461 --> 00:45:14.859
absolutely astute as far as money is concerned.

00:45:25.589 --> 00:45:31.711
It is not sufficient only to be something innocent,

00:45:31.912 --> 00:45:34.805
but it is more that it should be proved,

00:45:35.006 --> 00:45:37.826
that people should know that you are innocent!

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:51.215
Like I asked My son-in law, he is a very honest man,

00:45:51.416 --> 00:45:56.835
whether this would be honesty, so he answered,

00:45:57.036 --> 00:46:01.101
This may be honesty for outside purpose,

00:46:01.302 --> 00:46:04.481
but it is not in the essence of honesty.

00:46:18.061 --> 00:46:22.884
So, that is how you have to be honest, in the essence of it,

00:46:26.186 --> 00:46:29.557
and the essence of honesty is innocence.

00:46:32.639 --> 00:46:34.740
Essence of sincerity is innocence.

00:46:37.186 --> 00:46:40.500
Essence of beauty, glory, is innocence,

00:46:44.626 --> 00:46:49.996
and innocence is the one that gives you complete detachment.

00:46:54.254 --> 00:46:57.461
So, to such a symbol of innocence, when we bow,

00:46:57.662 --> 00:47:00.443
we must know what we have done about ourselves.

00:47:07.824 --> 00:47:12.019
Whatever has been your past, get out of it.

00:47:16.927 --> 00:47:20.919
Be just the opposite of what has been so bad before.

00:47:26.425 --> 00:47:31.010
Strongly against all that you were before, in the darkness.

00:47:36.193 --> 00:47:38.497
That is the sign of your character,

00:47:42.369 --> 00:47:43.868
and of your strength,

00:47:45.197 --> 00:47:48.527
and will show to the world that your Spirit,

00:47:48.728 --> 00:47:49.963
which is enlightened within you,

00:47:50.164 --> 00:47:56.242
has given you that strength and that new dimension.

00:48:05.107 --> 00:48:07.726
So the second oath we have to take

00:48:07.927 --> 00:48:10.164
before Shri Ganesha is that,

00:48:10.365 --> 00:48:12.624
I will be honest to myself.

00:48:21.876 --> 00:48:25.086
I will not deceive myself for anybody's sake.

00:48:30.304 --> 00:48:34.180
Now the third great thing about Shri Ganesha is

00:48:34.381 --> 00:48:38.271
that for Him no Gods exist except His Mother.

00:48:47.684 --> 00:48:50.404
And you know all the stories about Shri Ganesha,

00:48:50.605 --> 00:48:53.161
how He adored His Mother,

00:48:59.419 --> 00:49:02.434
because He knows His Mother is the Power;

00:49:07.232 --> 00:49:10.544
and that He is the source of your wisdom,

00:49:22.323 --> 00:49:24.471
He's the embodiment of wisdom,

00:49:28.322 --> 00:49:30.406
and the greatest wisdom He has:

00:49:30.607 --> 00:49:33.938
that it is better to worship the Mother than anybody else,

00:49:34.139 --> 00:49:35.622
because She is the Power.

00:49:45.268 --> 00:49:48.204
According to Him, even the Father, if you have to meet,

00:49:48.405 --> 00:49:49.922
you have to go through the Mother,

00:49:50.123 --> 00:49:52.803
and secondly Father is just the Witness.

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:07.322
All His security, all His powers, all His beauty,

00:50:07.523 --> 00:50:09.733
innocence, comes from His Mother.

00:50:17.369 --> 00:50:20.519
So with the third oath you have to take that,

00:50:20.720 --> 00:50:23.874
For us, our Mother is so powerful,

00:50:24.075 --> 00:50:26.153
why should we be afraid of anything?

00:50:38.602 --> 00:50:41.026
If She is going to give us the wisdom,

00:50:41.227 --> 00:50:44.578
why should we try to seek it anywhere else?

00:50:52.485 --> 00:50:55.070
I appear very innocent sometimes,

00:50:59.295 --> 00:51:03.120
but My innocence is complete intelligence, I think,

00:51:22.242 --> 00:51:26.930
and that is the reason, you see, people take time to accept.

00:51:32.828 --> 00:51:35.931
But people like Shri Ganesh

00:51:36.132 --> 00:51:39.124
who are the wisest of all, know the trick.

00:51:49.271 --> 00:51:52.492
The another oath we have to take today

00:51:52.693 --> 00:51:56.794
that, we'll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart,

00:51:56.995 --> 00:52:01.393
because they are made in the form of Shri Ganesha.

00:52:14.655 --> 00:52:16.600
We'll not make fun of them,

00:52:18.671 --> 00:52:20.025
we'll not laugh at them,

00:52:21.939 --> 00:52:25.071
as long as they are in Sahaja Yoga we have to respect.

00:52:28.369 --> 00:52:30.302
But they can be thrown away,

00:52:33.049 --> 00:52:34.649
they can get out of it.

00:52:36.830 --> 00:52:39.049
But unless and until this happens,

00:52:41.715 --> 00:52:46.793
do not put your ego on other people.

00:52:50.914 --> 00:52:53.344
Don't think that you understand everything.

00:52:57.641 --> 00:53:00.065
Don't think that you know everything.

00:53:02.354 --> 00:53:04.565
Respect each and every person,

00:53:07.454 --> 00:53:10.831
not for what he has read or what he has learnt,

00:53:11.032 --> 00:53:13.844
but because he is a great soul.

00:53:24.239 --> 00:53:27.166
I feel the whole West suffers from one,

00:53:27.367 --> 00:53:29.448
one simple disease, that is, they do not know

00:53:29.649 --> 00:53:31.633
how to respect anyone.

00:53:38.795 --> 00:53:40.786
Whatever doesn't suit their mind,

00:53:40.987 --> 00:53:43.670
they will never accept nor will respect.

00:53:50.310 --> 00:53:52.327
With their ego they want to judge everyone

00:53:52.528 --> 00:53:54.091
and condemn everyone.

00:53:57.805 --> 00:53:59.461
So, get out of it,

00:54:02.321 --> 00:54:04.761
and tell yourself, I don't know anything.

00:54:10.254 --> 00:54:12.339
I was a stupid fool with my ego.

00:54:15.868 --> 00:54:20.423
Humble down yourself in your heart, open your heart,

00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:27.079
and love each other.

00:54:28.907 --> 00:54:33.488
Respect and love is the two things

00:54:33.689 --> 00:54:36.142
you have to promise to Shri Ganesha.

00:54:40.595 --> 00:54:44.470
If you cannot do that, your ascent is going to be very difficult.

00:54:49.469 --> 00:54:50.742
May God bless you!
