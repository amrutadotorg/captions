00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.941
He went back just for last three years

00:00:57.084 --> 00:01:00.191
and people fixed Him to a cross.

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:11.060
It was somewhat destined.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.881
To open Agnya chakra

00:01:17.082 --> 00:01:19.060
He had to offer this sacrifice.

00:01:20.643 --> 00:01:22.369
So in this way He

00:01:24.577 --> 00:01:26.470
set up Agnya chakra.

00:01:29.035 --> 00:01:30.448
Agnya chakra is very

00:01:33.297 --> 00:01:34.876
constricted

00:01:35.757 --> 00:01:36.857
small

00:01:39.542 --> 00:01:41.696
and not easily openable,

00:01:43.497 --> 00:01:45.049
because a human being

00:01:46.221 --> 00:01:47.875
got freedom

00:01:49.307 --> 00:01:51.413
that made him egoistic.

00:01:53.627 --> 00:01:55.162
This ego

00:01:55.701 --> 00:01:58.375
constricted his Agnya chakra.

00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:03.385
And from that

00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:06.445
constricted Agnya chakra

00:02:07.478 --> 00:02:09.130
it was necessary to take out ego.

00:02:11.441 --> 00:02:13.897
And to take out ego

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:18.430
you have to control your (MAAN).

00:02:20.162 --> 00:02:22.836
But you do not take out your ego from your (MAAN).

00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:28.888
As soon as you will try to take out your ego from your (MAAN)

00:02:32.507 --> 00:02:34.632
the (MAAN) will go on increasing

00:02:34.833 --> 00:02:37.090
and the ego will go on increasing

00:02:38.316 --> 00:02:40.081
[ AHAAM  KAROTI  SAHA  AHAMKAR ]

00:02:41.168 --> 00:02:42.268
We do !

00:02:43.035 --> 00:02:47.320
It means that if we try to minimise our ego

00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.616
the ego will shoot up because

00:02:51.817 --> 00:02:54.458
we will try to do so with the help of ego only.

00:02:58.164 --> 00:02:59.846
Those who think

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:01.898
that to our ego

00:03:03.842 --> 00:03:04.942
will suppress

00:03:06.232 --> 00:03:07.625
will eat less food

00:03:09.727 --> 00:03:11.103
worldwide violence

00:03:12.141 --> 00:03:12.911
one

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.828
standing on one foot and some on their head.

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:20.147
Every type of

00:03:20.488 --> 00:03:21.560
experiment

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.072
people do to destroy their ego

00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:31.117
But it does not supress the ego.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.055
 It shoots up.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.200
To fast, to do (JAP TAP)

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.321
everything

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.360
 shoots up ego !

00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:44.620
[Havana] also gives rise to ego !

00:03:45.621 --> 00:03:48.735
Because Agni is right sided.

00:03:52.318 --> 00:03:53.541
Whatever

00:03:56.847 --> 00:04:00.283
karmakand we do, rituals  we perform gives rise to our ego.

00:04:10.341 --> 00:04:12.059
For the past thousands of years human beings

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.862
have been doing the same type of karmakand.

00:04:16.587 --> 00:04:21.542
Everything inside out whatever has been taught, is he doing.

00:04:26.282 --> 00:04:29.301
This is why Sahajyoga is against karmakand.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.552
There is no need to do any karmakand.

00:04:38.926 --> 00:04:41.612
And to go to the extremes is all the more bad.

00:04:43.429 --> 00:04:44.529
As I said

00:04:45.149 --> 00:04:47.102
that to take away your ego

00:04:47.303 --> 00:04:51.241
you, in Marathi is called (JODE PATTI ) beat 'it' with shoes.

00:04:52.376 --> 00:04:55.213
So daily in the morning Sahajyogis

00:04:55.512 --> 00:04:57.091
move out in a line with shoes in their hands.

00:05:00.217 --> 00:05:03.050
O.k ! but if you have ego, then only

00:05:03.985 --> 00:05:06.759
Every one is going out with a shoe in his hand.

00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:09.236
All this

00:05:10.493 --> 00:05:13.290
karmakand  penetrated into Sahajyoga too.

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:20.161
So much so, that from France a gentleman came

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:24.522
from Vashi hospital and got this karmakand from there.

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.863
It is for sick people.

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:32.468
If you have this trouble, then you do this karmakand

00:05:32.915 --> 00:05:36.259
The karmakand of cancer are written in that.

00:05:38.284 --> 00:05:40.621
I said it is human being's nature

00:05:41.353 --> 00:05:45.698
to do karmakand because he thinks that he can do it

00:05:49.068 --> 00:05:51.080
because of my karmakand, work will be done

00:05:52.943 --> 00:05:54.875
and in this karmakand

00:05:55.143 --> 00:05:56.500
not only you

00:05:57.376 --> 00:05:58.534
in foreign country also

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:03.082
many people go on doing karmakand of various types.

00:06:04.951 --> 00:06:06.051
For example

00:06:06.627 --> 00:06:09.337
will go to church once a year.

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:12.450
Means today.

00:06:13.575 --> 00:06:15.726
After that they don't take even the name of God.

00:06:16.369 --> 00:06:18.697
After doing all the dirty jobs of world

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.315
and go to Catholic  ( DHARAM) and make confession

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:28.595
If you can see this foolishness, then will be a Sahajyogi.

00:06:29.393 --> 00:06:32.809
If you can understand that this wrong act

00:06:33.635 --> 00:06:35.495
What we have done is wrong

00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:38.281
and now onwards this act is not to be done.

00:06:39.055 --> 00:06:41.002
If you can understand this

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:44.492
your brain will retain it

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:48.129
Now,

00:06:48.972 --> 00:06:52.269
Karmakandis have got all the more qualities.

00:06:53.804 --> 00:06:57.633
One thing is that they are misers number one.

00:07:00.191 --> 00:07:02.295
If you talk to them about ten rupees

00:07:02.496 --> 00:07:05.022
they start jumping into the sky.

00:07:07.363 --> 00:07:09.795
That is called in Marathi, 'KODI CHUMBAK'

00:07:11.552 --> 00:07:14.103
One thing is that in Marathi there are such words

00:07:14.422 --> 00:07:16.534
That your ego will dissolve easily.

00:07:20.888 --> 00:07:22.208
For example somebody

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:26.033
talked high of himself, i did this, i did that

00:07:27.465 --> 00:07:29.437
tell him in a low voice

00:07:31.748 --> 00:07:33.902
'You are climbing a chickpea tree'.

00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:35.716
A chickpea tree doesn't exist !

00:07:37.159 --> 00:07:40.085
[Shri Mataji speaks in Marathi]

00:07:40.554 --> 00:07:42.307
 So he cools down.

00:07:42.982 --> 00:07:46.025
I did this, i did that, i

00:07:46.712 --> 00:07:49.087
Till this 'I' ness doesn't go

00:07:49.288 --> 00:07:53.033
till then our recognising Christ is wrong.

00:07:54.281 --> 00:07:55.941
But it is surprising

00:07:56.258 --> 00:07:59.768
that what is called ' Christian Nations' where there is christanity

00:08:00.142 --> 00:08:02.662
more than them egoistic I have not seen

00:08:03.665 --> 00:08:05.074
particularly English.

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440
American

00:08:06.892 --> 00:08:07.892
everybody

00:08:08.333 --> 00:08:10.558
is so much egoistic

00:08:10.995 --> 00:08:14.237
that can't understand these desciples of Christ.

00:08:16.141 --> 00:08:17.859
Now what is the remedy of this ego?

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.820
that should be thought

00:08:22.116 --> 00:08:24.417
It's remedy was Jesus Christ

00:08:24.999 --> 00:08:27.023
and He has taught

00:08:27.224 --> 00:08:28.713
 that now

00:08:31.062 --> 00:08:32.262
love everybody

00:08:34.797 --> 00:08:36.555
love your enemies too.

00:08:38.459 --> 00:08:40.987
It's remedy He said was 'Love'.

00:08:44.327 --> 00:08:46.323
and apart from 'Love'

00:08:46.915 --> 00:08:48.015
there is no remedy.

00:08:49.253 --> 00:08:50.449
But this 'Love'

00:08:54.164 --> 00:08:56.774
is the 'Love' of Param Chaitanya.

00:08:58.702 --> 00:09:02.856
He said clearly,'Seek yourself'.

00:09:04.073 --> 00:09:07.973
knock the door and the door will open !

00:09:10.309 --> 00:09:13.715
It doesn't mean that you go and knock the door.

00:09:15.374 --> 00:09:19.669
It means open the doors of your heart.

00:09:20.748 --> 00:09:22.872
A peson whose heart is small

00:09:23.981 --> 00:09:25.314
those who are misers

00:09:27.286 --> 00:09:30.726
that person can never be a Sahajyogi.

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.056
And another thing

00:09:37.464 --> 00:09:38.564
which is very important

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.085
if you get angry

00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:46.319
it means that you have too much ego.

00:09:49.858 --> 00:09:53.127
I have seen absolutely angry volatile people

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:59.593
And they feel elated saying,'I am a very angry person'.

00:10:00.708 --> 00:10:02.664
Such people cannot be in Sahajyoga.

00:10:05.872 --> 00:10:10.765
Those who know to 'Love' and that too 'Pure Love'

00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:16.718
and that too such 'Love' where there is no expectation

00:10:17.358 --> 00:10:18.458
no desire

00:10:19.516 --> 00:10:22.672
those who completely know to love selflessly

00:10:23.196 --> 00:10:24.648
only they can be in Sahajyoga.

00:10:27.261 --> 00:10:29.947
Egoistic people do wrong acts.

00:10:30.667 --> 00:10:32.083
I am tired of them.

00:10:35.946 --> 00:10:37.965
They will start something on their own

00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:41.965
and they won't even tell me.

00:10:44.172 --> 00:10:45.755
and by doing so

00:10:46.178 --> 00:10:47.919
Today thousands of questions have risen

00:10:51.356 --> 00:10:53.812
Today it is worth saying that in Delhi

00:10:54.947 --> 00:10:56.887
once they

00:10:57.813 --> 00:11:00.682
on the day of some puja hurriedly told me

00:11:00.972 --> 00:11:02.209
that we are getting land

00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.366
 only this much.

00:11:03.802 --> 00:11:05.378
How much did we charge ?

00:11:05.579 --> 00:11:07.363
How is that going to be ?

00:11:07.564 --> 00:11:08.082
How is the land ?

00:11:08.288 --> 00:11:09.500
Nothing !

00:11:10.218 --> 00:11:12.198
And no Sahajyogi told me.

00:11:14.206 --> 00:11:17.676
Because if tomorrow somebody says, 'Mataji has said so'

00:11:17.794 --> 00:11:20.266
leave that person.

00:11:22.852 --> 00:11:25.522
If I have to say something, I will tell myself.

00:11:26.344 --> 00:11:29.649
After that we had so many meetings, I didn't say anything.

00:11:29.786 --> 00:11:32.211
Now those who have given them money

00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:34.859
are holding their heads

00:11:36.637 --> 00:11:38.363
that they have been cheated !

00:11:39.239 --> 00:11:40.339
How to get back that money ?

00:11:41.808 --> 00:11:44.106
Without asking Me all the work

00:11:46.367 --> 00:11:47.414
Absolutely without asking Me.

00:11:48.554 --> 00:11:50.620
The land is so bad

00:11:50.813 --> 00:11:52.149
that they have received a notice

00:11:52.169 --> 00:11:53.717
that you cannot construct anything here.

00:11:53.731 --> 00:11:56.131
On the contrary you will be arrested

00:12:00.766 --> 00:12:04.047
Every Sahajyogi has right to tell Me

00:12:05.319 --> 00:12:06.419
and ask Me

00:12:07.208 --> 00:12:09.242
they made a society of their own

00:12:09.443 --> 00:12:10.687
 and became mad

00:12:11.188 --> 00:12:12.188
that they are getting land

00:12:14.032 --> 00:12:15.559
It is such a bad land

00:12:17.244 --> 00:12:19.942
It is said that you cannot grow even a chicken

00:12:20.786 --> 00:12:24.559
Are the Sahajyogis even worst than chickens ?

00:12:29.371 --> 00:12:31.350
Now whatever has happened is foolishness !

00:12:32.141 --> 00:12:33.978
and for that I am not responsible.

00:12:35.837 --> 00:12:38.158
But you ask for your money back.

00:12:39.982 --> 00:12:41.969
It is none of My resposibility.

00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:49.875
Jesus Christ had said that

00:12:53.020 --> 00:12:54.254
those people

00:12:59.875 --> 00:13:01.474
make houses

00:13:02.715 --> 00:13:03.715
live in houses

00:13:04.451 --> 00:13:06.288
they should watch birds

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:09.983
he makes his own (GHARONDA)

00:13:10.365 --> 00:13:15.062
with how much love they make a small one for their ownself

00:13:18.723 --> 00:13:20.918
and when they make their home

00:13:21.325 --> 00:13:23.535
they feel a great joy in constructing that home.

00:13:29.003 --> 00:13:32.025
He explained it in every way

00:13:32.226 --> 00:13:34.782
that you give up attatchment.

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:36.690
This is my house.

00:13:37.961 --> 00:13:39.061
This is my land.

00:13:40.179 --> 00:13:41.512
They are my children.

00:13:43.033 --> 00:13:44.798
Even this much that it is my country.

00:13:47.725 --> 00:13:50.618
This attatchment should be given up.

00:13:50.943 --> 00:13:54.886
Then only you can be great.

00:13:57.999 --> 00:14:00.276
In the whole world you are

00:14:00.477 --> 00:14:02.012
brothers and sisters.

00:14:02.825 --> 00:14:06.577
It doesn't mean that you give up devotion to your country.

00:14:06.778 --> 00:14:07.265
Not at all !

00:14:07.948 --> 00:14:09.729
If you are not devoted to your country

00:14:10.715 --> 00:14:11.815
you can't do anything.

00:14:13.133 --> 00:14:15.525
Within you there should be devotion to country.

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:20.669
But the same devotee to country becomes devoted to the world.

00:14:21.341 --> 00:14:23.082
If there is no devotion to one's country

00:14:23.198 --> 00:14:25.606
if there is no drop, how can there be a sea ?

00:14:27.578 --> 00:14:29.446
first of all

00:14:29.748 --> 00:14:31.862
whether there is devotion to country, is to be seen first of all.

00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.058
If you are working  against your country

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:36.500
you are not devoted to it.

00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:38.767
Jesus Christ

00:14:39.264 --> 00:14:41.667
had no need to go back.

00:14:42.525 --> 00:14:43.910
He had said also

00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:46.606
That there live such people

00:14:47.048 --> 00:14:49.681
Those who have the desire of only (MAL) are (MALECH)

00:14:51.017 --> 00:14:54.393
But Shalivahana told Him, 'No ! No 1 you go'.

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:57.264
' And teach them (NIRMAL TATTWAM) the principle of purity.

00:14:59.549 --> 00:15:01.186
He went there to teach 'Nirmal Tatwam'

00:15:01.387 --> 00:15:02.729
and they put an end to His life.

00:15:04.741 --> 00:15:05.941
It is mad people's country.

00:15:07.908 --> 00:15:09.594
He didn't need to learn anything.

00:15:10.651 --> 00:15:12.150
But had to teach something.

00:15:12.350 --> 00:15:13.450
That is why He went there.

00:15:14.476 --> 00:15:16.083
and for the same reason

00:15:18.388 --> 00:15:20.152
His end was this way.

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:22.875
But 'Wiseness' and 'Forgiveness'

00:15:24.526 --> 00:15:26.060
'Forgiveness' is the only mantra

00:15:26.261 --> 00:15:27.743
which can open Agnya chakra.

00:15:28.473 --> 00:15:31.515
If against anyone you have

00:15:34.111 --> 00:15:36.837
 any ill feeling

00:15:37.607 --> 00:15:39.358
against anyone

00:15:39.843 --> 00:15:40.943
anger

00:15:42.041 --> 00:15:42.941
or

00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:48.012
if there is a tendency to be violent against anyone

00:15:48.298 --> 00:15:50.183
your Agnya cannot be up to the mark.

00:15:52.299 --> 00:15:53.891
Whatever you have to do

00:15:54.092 --> 00:15:55.613
you have to do with love.

00:15:57.200 --> 00:15:59.140
Even if you have to say something to anyone

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.767
you have to say

00:16:00.968 --> 00:16:03.175
so that his life becomes 'NIRMAL'.

00:16:04.409 --> 00:16:07.238
It doesn't mean that you spoil your children.

00:16:08.299 --> 00:16:09.448
To children

00:16:09.649 --> 00:16:11.888
you have to perfectly

00:16:15.309 --> 00:16:16.797
discipline

00:16:17.822 --> 00:16:20.468
If you cannot discipline children

00:16:20.753 --> 00:16:23.408
your children can never be good Sahajyogis.

00:16:25.775 --> 00:16:28.925
And for that you must be yourself disciplined.

00:16:31.345 --> 00:16:32.815
If you are not disciplined yourself

00:16:33.016 --> 00:16:34.731
you cannot discipline your children.

00:16:36.570 --> 00:16:41.280
About Jesus Christ's life very little was written.

00:16:41.736 --> 00:16:44.588
But He was so disciplined

00:16:45.730 --> 00:16:47.051
In this way

00:16:48.272 --> 00:16:49.372
tolerated

00:16:51.207 --> 00:16:52.929
and from His life He showed

00:16:53.997 --> 00:16:56.286
He didn't need to be married

00:16:57.809 --> 00:16:59.233
He didn't marry

00:16:59.583 --> 00:17:02.618
It doesn't mean that He was against marriage.

00:17:03.203 --> 00:17:06.904
People have such wrong notions

00:17:08.384 --> 00:17:09.584
And that is why

00:17:12.085 --> 00:17:13.952
they have self made notions

00:17:14.153 --> 00:17:17.679
the women who are called 'NUNS' were married to Jesus Christ

00:17:17.855 --> 00:17:19.164
He was Sakhshat Ganesha !

00:17:19.939 --> 00:17:21.680
How can anyone be married to Him ?

00:17:23.461 --> 00:17:24.561
Apart from that

00:17:25.361 --> 00:17:28.010
Men also no to marry

00:17:28.632 --> 00:17:31.698
such unnatural/ uncultural  concepts were taught.

00:17:32.837 --> 00:17:37.659
With that everyone can be kept under control

00:17:37.896 --> 00:17:40.896
but one cannot become Christian.

00:17:44.862 --> 00:17:45.933
like such

00:17:47.514 --> 00:17:49.502
 [KRITRIM BANDHAN]

00:17:50.076 --> 00:17:52.337
to cover oneself

00:17:52.538 --> 00:17:54.844
today Chritian religion is losing its importance.

00:17:55.741 --> 00:17:57.244
They forgot Jesus !

00:17:57.950 --> 00:18:00.390
and created a religion out of their own

00:18:00.803 --> 00:18:02.807
and call it Christian religion.

00:18:14.349 --> 00:18:16.186
The Christian religion of today

00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:19.912
Looks like a blot on the name of Jesus !

00:18:20.968 --> 00:18:23.193
Because I was born in this religion

00:18:23.394 --> 00:18:26.200
I saw the ins and outs of this religion.

00:18:29.258 --> 00:18:31.124
The same is the case with Hindu religion.

00:18:33.266 --> 00:18:37.063
In Hindu religion you cannot be communal at all.

00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:43.877
Because your various gurus, real gurus

00:18:44.078 --> 00:18:48.409
 like Datatreya etc., and Nathpanthies

00:18:48.910 --> 00:18:52.836
are your many incarnations

00:18:53.037 --> 00:18:56.161
and your Sayambus are many.

00:18:58.582 --> 00:19:02.278
You don't have one book. You have number of books.

00:19:02.651 --> 00:19:05.326
Only Jesus and Bible

00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:09.744
They can be fundamentalists.

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.439
And they can be Yahudis also

00:19:15.590 --> 00:19:17.379
And all the three are related to each other.

00:19:19.033 --> 00:19:19.933
It is written in books.

00:19:21.364 --> 00:19:24.193
But a Hindu can never be communal.

00:19:25.052 --> 00:19:27.487
Because some have some guru and others a different guru.

00:19:29.675 --> 00:19:31.512
Some adore Mahalaxmi.

00:19:32.451 --> 00:19:34.291
Others  Renuka Devi.

00:19:35.259 --> 00:19:36.993
Some to Krishna.

00:19:40.135 --> 00:19:42.300
So, every person

00:19:43.916 --> 00:19:45.131
every

00:19:45.332 --> 00:19:47.365
family

00:19:48.139 --> 00:19:49.239
individually

00:19:52.530 --> 00:19:54.620
adore incarnation, books.

00:19:56.997 --> 00:19:59.296
As such there is no book

00:19:59.497 --> 00:20:02.557
which can be called as Holy Bible.

00:20:04.233 --> 00:20:06.300
So to all the religions

00:20:07.108 --> 00:20:09.508
a Hindu should

00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.240
pay respect.

00:20:13.102 --> 00:20:14.102
I have noticed

00:20:14.912 --> 00:20:17.876
The capacity of paying respect is maximum in Hindus.

00:20:19.512 --> 00:20:22.327
Once we were in a hotel, there was a Bible.

00:20:24.518 --> 00:20:27.173
They keep a Bible (IN THE ROOM) whether somebody reads or not.

00:20:28.302 --> 00:20:30.309
That Bible fell on the floor.

00:20:30.849 --> 00:20:34.495
There was one Hindu with us.

00:20:35.034 --> 00:20:40.439
He picked up The Bible, put It on his head and then on the table.

00:20:42.578 --> 00:20:45.018
They will never touch The Bible with their feet.

00:20:46.598 --> 00:20:48.681
The Christians will do so.

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:51.440
A Hindu will never do so.

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:55.289
To respect everybody is Hindu's Dharma.

00:20:56.108 --> 00:21:01.846
But those who have come out of it are very very strange.

00:21:03.808 --> 00:21:06.167
Those who are our politicians

00:21:06.368 --> 00:21:08.437
such people have taken birth.

00:21:09.798 --> 00:21:11.594
As mushrooms come out in monsoon

00:21:11.795 --> 00:21:13.493
same way some people have come out.

00:21:14.228 --> 00:21:15.961
But they are not Hindus.

00:21:19.274 --> 00:21:21.348
They don't know anything about their (DHARMA) religion.

00:21:23.047 --> 00:21:25.638
North Indians don't know it at all.

00:21:26.344 --> 00:21:27.444
And those

00:21:28.671 --> 00:21:30.380
who are South Indians

00:21:30.832 --> 00:21:32.952
they know that bramhins have to be given money

00:21:33.153 --> 00:21:35.408
here and there, have to do this and that (RITUALS).

00:21:36.075 --> 00:21:38.665
In this Maharashtra there is nothing else than karmakand.

00:21:40.298 --> 00:21:41.600
They are so karmakandi.

00:21:41.801 --> 00:21:43.654
In Maharashtra I have worked very hard.

00:21:43.974 --> 00:21:45.374
Everything was waste.

00:21:45.783 --> 00:21:47.352
Because they are very ritualistic  (KARMAKANDI).

00:21:48.258 --> 00:21:49.358
They cannot give it up.

00:21:49.927 --> 00:21:51.819
Here is the temple of Siddhi Vinayak.

00:21:52.732 --> 00:21:55.790
The Ganeshji that is there, I have awakened that.

00:21:56.469 --> 00:22:00.735
Now what do I see that
there one mile long

00:22:02.810 --> 00:22:05.425
long lines one mile long

00:22:06.753 --> 00:22:08.454
are standing on Tuesday.

00:22:09.854 --> 00:22:11.492
Gneshji too must have slept.

00:22:14.477 --> 00:22:18.821
The ritualistic people of this type are in Maharashtra.

00:22:19.719 --> 00:22:23.070
Because of that Karmakand their temprament has become hot.

00:22:25.852 --> 00:22:27.395
And in North India also

00:22:28.210 --> 00:22:29.610
I have seen

00:22:29.811 --> 00:22:32.026
that some people are Karmakandi.

00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:35.208
And those who are Karmakandi

00:22:35.617 --> 00:22:38.192
they have lot of anger, are hot tempered.

00:22:40.253 --> 00:22:44.709
And those who are not in Karmakand are very cool.

00:22:45.863 --> 00:22:49.686
So the first thing is Stop ritualism

00:22:49.723 --> 00:22:51.878
but respect everything.

00:22:52.622 --> 00:22:55.451
Stopping ritualism doesn't mean to kick everything.

00:22:57.567 --> 00:23:01.986
This balancing was taught by Jesus Christ.

00:23:04.136 --> 00:23:07.337
Without this balance your Agnya Chakra cannot open.

00:23:09.052 --> 00:23:13.126
Everbody's respect

00:23:13.327 --> 00:23:20.888
and unnecessary

00:23:21.089 --> 00:23:25.651
ritualism, in which wrong people are growing.

00:23:29.065 --> 00:23:32.844
Now a day's false gurus

00:23:33.268 --> 00:23:35.746
They exist because of ritualism (KARMAKAND).

00:23:38.109 --> 00:23:41.750
They will say you give so much money, do this do that.

00:23:41.966 --> 00:23:44.337
Do Havana

00:23:45.381 --> 00:23:50.233
108 times daily read these names, those names

00:23:50.434 --> 00:23:53.145
giving you mantras, doing this that.

00:23:53.317 --> 00:23:57.526
These are Karmakandis and teach you Karmakand.

00:23:57.813 --> 00:24:01.285
Completely against which is Jesus Christ.

00:24:09.799 --> 00:24:14.151
Which He knew that by doing Karmakand

00:24:15.818 --> 00:24:17.789
a human being becomes egoistic.

00:24:18.939 --> 00:24:21.292
and to crack this ego,

00:24:21.871 --> 00:24:24.575
To Karmakand, He

00:24:27.433 --> 00:24:29.151
had totally forbidden.

00:24:36.725 --> 00:24:40.770
The same way, in the name of God

00:24:41.741 --> 00:24:44.887
anyone earning money was objectionable to Him.

00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:48.647
On the contrary reverse process started.

00:24:49.536 --> 00:24:51.889
Earn money and consume.

00:24:54.047 --> 00:24:55.743
They don't give up earning

00:24:55.944 --> 00:24:58.272
but (believe to) earn money and consume.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.140
It doesn't solve any problem.

00:25:04.246 --> 00:25:06.082
Today in Sahajyoga work

00:25:06.373 --> 00:25:07.813
We should remember

00:25:08.568 --> 00:25:12.897
how much money we paid for Sahajyoga work.

00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:15.369
How much money did we give?

00:25:18.333 --> 00:25:21.448
Jesus Christ had twelve  fish killers.

00:25:22.601 --> 00:25:23.701
Even they

00:25:26.242 --> 00:25:28.722
spread in the  whole world by working hard.

00:25:29.552 --> 00:25:31.929
Today you are so many disciples of mine.

00:25:32.946 --> 00:25:34.553
And if you want

00:25:34.754 --> 00:25:37.505
you can give realisation to so many people.

00:25:39.633 --> 00:25:42.625
Can introduce so many people to Sahajyoga.

00:25:43.292 --> 00:25:45.438
But the people should not be half baked.

00:25:45.899 --> 00:25:46.999
They should be deep.

00:25:48.222 --> 00:25:52.636
Unless they are deep, they cannot understand.

00:25:52.843 --> 00:25:56.596
And for that the greatest thing is

00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.805
that how much we love them.

00:26:00.615 --> 00:26:03.698
And how much love they give to others.

00:26:04.681 --> 00:26:06.737
Anyone who is a leader in Sahajyoga

00:26:06.938 --> 00:26:08.827
he should remember first of all

00:26:08.930 --> 00:26:13.693
that the teaching of Jesus Christ is to love everybody.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:16.262
Am i doing that ?

00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:19.586
I shower my anger over everyone.

00:26:20.293 --> 00:26:22.391
 I keep everybody under control

00:26:25.431 --> 00:26:27.498
I express my anger with my eyes.

00:26:29.459 --> 00:26:30.892
This ego is

00:26:31.093 --> 00:26:32.395
very much

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:36.674
not only against  Sahajyoga

00:26:37.026 --> 00:26:38.792
but his destructor

00:26:40.198 --> 00:26:42.090
Whosoever is egoistic

00:26:42.463 --> 00:26:47.030
should lessen it and replace it with love

00:26:47.593 --> 00:26:49.985
Life will be  a pleasure.

00:26:50.968 --> 00:26:52.519
Life will be beautiful !

00:26:53.663 --> 00:26:55.512
If you don't know how to love

00:26:55.703 --> 00:26:57.611
then for a few days you come out of Sahajyoga.

00:26:58.255 --> 00:27:00.941
First you open the doors of your heart.

00:27:03.516 --> 00:27:04.773
With that only

00:27:04.974 --> 00:27:07.582
With its Shakti only Sahajyoga will spread.

00:27:09.227 --> 00:27:11.500
The question is that those who spread Sahajyoga

00:27:11.881 --> 00:27:13.172
they have the Shakti (Power)of love less

00:27:13.242 --> 00:27:15.047
and the Shakti of anger more.

00:27:15.540 --> 00:27:16.640
It will never spread.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.262
With love it will spread

00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:23.207
And with anger it will minimise and diminish.

00:27:24.944 --> 00:27:27.110
The teaching of Jesus

00:27:27.310 --> 00:27:30.197
is necessary for us to understand.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:35.342
Sorry ! I had to talk in Hindi language

00:27:35.543 --> 00:27:38.453
because most of the people are here Indians

00:27:38.650 --> 00:27:40.828
Some of them are Marathis

00:27:41.035 --> 00:27:44.576
and others are from North India.

00:27:45.403 --> 00:27:48.518
I was telling them about Christ.

00:27:48.719 --> 00:27:50.708
What was His power ?

00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:53.395
His power was of 'Love'.

00:27:55.753 --> 00:27:58.700
And not of anger

00:28:01.096 --> 00:28:04.296
Because He is the one

00:28:04.497 --> 00:28:06.827
who has crossed

00:28:07.028 --> 00:28:12.619
the most difficult center of Agnya.

00:28:14.733 --> 00:28:16.771
Those people who have ego

00:28:18.113 --> 00:28:20.006
never realise they have ego

00:28:21.593 --> 00:28:22.789
With their ego they do

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:25.448
 all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:27.311
Without asking Me

00:28:27.512 --> 00:28:29.993
they have done something in Delhi.

00:28:30.765 --> 00:28:31.678
Without asking me

00:28:31.879 --> 00:28:33.812
they have done something in Russia.

00:28:34.353 --> 00:28:36.706
And it is so destructive to Sahajyoga.

00:28:37.849 --> 00:28:39.329
that they don't realise

00:28:40.286 --> 00:28:42.268
what they have done is the crime

00:28:42.469 --> 00:28:45.895
which is punishable by all Divine laws.

00:28:50.410 --> 00:28:52.900
If you want to do anything you must

00:28:53.406 --> 00:28:54.886
tell me beforehand.

00:28:55.823 --> 00:28:57.375
You must consult Me

00:28:57.576 --> 00:28:59.039
you must talk to Me

00:28:59.151 --> 00:29:02.329
Because I know what is happening.

00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.433
You don't know if somebody wants to cheat you.

00:29:08.162 --> 00:29:11.697
Then how will you know if you were

00:29:12.737 --> 00:29:14.836
so sensitive you would find out

00:29:17.713 --> 00:29:19.240
You would have asked Me,

00:29:19.441 --> 00:29:21.432
'Mother what should we do ?'

00:29:23.126 --> 00:29:24.733
At least ask Me.

00:29:25.946 --> 00:29:29.059
This is the main thing missing among

00:29:29.762 --> 00:29:31.322
Sahajyogis now that

00:29:31.523 --> 00:29:34.707
 we have a kind of a very subtle ego.

00:29:35.644 --> 00:29:37.267
If you make somebody a leader

00:29:37.803 --> 00:29:39.086
it is very dangerous sometimes.

00:29:39.287 --> 00:29:40.317
If the leader developes

00:29:40.526 --> 00:29:42.022
ego because of his wife,

00:29:43.732 --> 00:29:44.832
It is a very difficult thing.

00:29:45.683 --> 00:29:47.782
They can destroy Sahajyoga completely.

00:29:51.548 --> 00:29:52.948
Anything is possible.

00:29:54.401 --> 00:29:56.787
So before you do anything like that

00:29:57.135 --> 00:29:58.468
you have to consult (Me).

00:29:58.985 --> 00:30:00.143
I am still living

00:30:00.953 --> 00:30:01.853
and you can ask.

00:30:02.695 --> 00:30:05.549
You can write to Me, you can telephone too.

00:30:08.099 --> 00:30:09.722
At least I am there to tell you.

00:30:11.009 --> 00:30:13.060
But then you have to develop

00:30:13.376 --> 00:30:15.213
your balance and your love.

00:30:16.027 --> 00:30:19.094
That is only through this Param Chaitanya

00:30:19.729 --> 00:30:22.669
It is all pervading power of Divine Love.

00:30:23.218 --> 00:30:26.166
You can develop that discretion.

00:30:26.969 --> 00:30:27.761
special

00:30:28.241 --> 00:30:30.940
.....powers.

00:30:31.461 --> 00:30:33.575
Even if somebody telephones to Me

00:30:33.595 --> 00:30:36.543
immediately I know what is wrong with that person.

00:30:37.901 --> 00:30:40.177
I don't say that you can become like Me.

00:30:40.352 --> 00:30:43.657
But at least you have vibrations to see.

00:30:44.343 --> 00:30:46.497
Also see your own vibrations.

00:30:47.685 --> 00:30:48.785
How are you moving ?

00:30:49.555 --> 00:30:50.989
Put a paper on your hand

00:30:51.608 --> 00:30:54.823
and you will see it will start shaking before My photograph.

00:30:56.827 --> 00:30:57.927
With this ego

00:30:59.270 --> 00:31:00.525
you cannot go further

00:31:01.116 --> 00:31:02.699
Why did you come to sahajyoga ?

00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.590
You came here not to become

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:06.900
some sort of a leader

00:31:07.354 --> 00:31:08.762
or some sort of a

00:31:10.508 --> 00:31:11.608
a king but

00:31:12.933 --> 00:31:14.516
you came here

00:31:14.887 --> 00:31:17.947
to become a great guru.

00:31:18.518 --> 00:31:20.815
As you ask Me Gurupad Dijiye.

00:31:22.391 --> 00:31:25.308
For that you have to have in Sahajyoga

00:31:25.658 --> 00:31:28.290
a complete humility

00:31:29.217 --> 00:31:30.887
natural humility

00:31:34.541 --> 00:31:36.240
natural balance.

00:31:36.772 --> 00:31:40.014
This is what Christ has taught us.

00:31:53.326 --> 00:31:54.426
At that time

00:31:57.349 --> 00:31:59.678
I don't think that people had that much ego.

00:32:00.735 --> 00:32:03.612
Ego is a modern present to you.

00:32:04.876 --> 00:32:06.998
People get ego out of anything.

00:32:09.295 --> 00:32:12.585
For example, I met one lady once

00:32:12.639 --> 00:32:14.799
and found her ego very bad.

00:32:15.336 --> 00:32:16.672
I said, ''What is the matter with her?''

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:20.426
So, I asked My daughters ,''What does she do?''

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:24.475
They said," Mummy She knows how to make dolls.''

00:32:25.413 --> 00:32:26.513
For that she had ego.

00:32:28.781 --> 00:32:29.681
What is so great

00:32:30.510 --> 00:32:32.038
than to be a good sahajyogi

00:32:32.436 --> 00:32:34.781
You may be the king, you may be anything.

00:32:34.952 --> 00:32:36.729
Now you see the Prime Ministers

00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.775
and all of them going to jail.

00:32:40.585 --> 00:32:42.077
What are they compared to you?

00:32:42.514 --> 00:32:43.714
They have no balance.

00:32:44.537 --> 00:32:45.637
They have no sense.

00:32:48.616 --> 00:32:50.787
What makes you a separate

00:32:52.149 --> 00:32:53.249
individuals

00:32:53.963 --> 00:32:55.792
higher people, because

00:32:56.806 --> 00:32:59.858
you have no ego.

00:33:03.369 --> 00:33:05.634
Now people try to remove their ego

00:33:07.111 --> 00:33:08.211
Their two types.....

00:33:09.863 --> 00:33:13.080
So they will go on beating themselves with shoes.

00:33:15.234 --> 00:33:18.920
All kinds of ritualistic things they do to remove their ego.

00:33:20.050 --> 00:33:22.339
But all this we do with our mind.

00:33:23.483 --> 00:33:26.550
Whatever you do with your mind will give you ego only.

00:33:29.922 --> 00:33:31.082
They become ascetic.

00:33:31.353 --> 00:33:33.641
They are the greatest egoist.

00:33:33.827 --> 00:33:36.933
I must say, Hitler was the greatest ascetic.

00:33:37.765 --> 00:33:40.104
With his asceticism he became Hitler.

00:33:40.332 --> 00:33:41.737
If you want to become Hitler,

00:33:41.938 --> 00:33:42.994
you become ascetic.

00:33:44.244 --> 00:33:46.756
In Sahajyoga you are not allowed at all

00:33:47.210 --> 00:33:48.310
all this asceticism.

00:33:55.116 --> 00:33:57.151
You have to be loving

00:33:57.782 --> 00:33:58.882
affectionate

00:33:59.378 --> 00:34:01.460
kind and disciplined.

00:34:03.321 --> 00:34:06.388
I must say this because when you are loving

00:34:06.887 --> 00:34:09.811
you go out of bounds sometimes

00:34:10.282 --> 00:34:12.436
because you have no discipline of sahajyoga.

00:34:12.879 --> 00:34:14.214
Loving doesn't mean

00:34:14.889 --> 00:34:15.989
that

00:34:16.707 --> 00:34:18.714
you become like a

00:34:20.192 --> 00:34:21.934
Romeo, juliet,doesn't mean that.

00:34:24.227 --> 00:34:27.818
You must have your balance through your discipline.

00:34:28.835 --> 00:34:30.624
If you have no discipline

00:34:30.777 --> 00:34:34.066
you can never be a good Sahajyogi.

00:34:37.741 --> 00:34:39.506
From the life of Christ

00:34:40.257 --> 00:34:41.357
we have to learn

00:34:42.099 --> 00:34:43.227
these things

00:34:43.428 --> 00:34:46.739
that unless and until we have these things

00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:48.990
we cannot

00:34:51.878 --> 00:34:53.283
become good Sahajyogis.

00:34:54.712 --> 00:34:56.445
Firstly, ritualistic nature

00:34:59.121 --> 00:35:00.625
secondly, anger

00:35:01.733 --> 00:35:03.768
thirdly, miserliness.

00:35:05.589 --> 00:35:07.765
like

00:35:08.241 --> 00:35:09.419
if you

00:35:10.654 --> 00:35:11.896
go to England

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:13.080
it is written there

00:35:13.412 --> 00:35:15.836
'save pounds by taking a taxi'

00:35:20.528 --> 00:35:21.628
this is what it is.

00:35:22.183 --> 00:35:23.283
Miserliness

00:35:23.517 --> 00:35:25.639
where can we save money,

00:35:26.148 --> 00:35:28.731
'Mother, can you give concession?'

00:35:29.550 --> 00:35:30.650
it is not a

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:33.367
some sort of a business I am doing here.

00:35:36.016 --> 00:35:39.496
'If you make it half price, so many will come'.

00:35:42.502 --> 00:35:44.458
''I am not using your money''.

00:35:44.831 --> 00:35:46.588
I am using it for your buildings.

00:35:46.598 --> 00:35:48.467
all this I have got it

00:35:49.605 --> 00:35:52.252
of course My money also and your money.

00:35:53.316 --> 00:35:54.812
So many things I have done

00:35:55.534 --> 00:35:56.998
The whole of Vashi

00:35:57.697 --> 00:35:59.415
the whole of Ashram

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:02.801
In Delhi two ashrams,

00:36:03.254 --> 00:36:04.781
then the whole of school

00:36:05.774 --> 00:36:06.674
and also

00:36:07.374 --> 00:36:09.465
land in Pune and other places.

00:36:10.370 --> 00:36:12.179
Now in Pune they want Me

00:36:12.222 --> 00:36:14.737
to pay the land, to pay for everything

00:36:14.892 --> 00:36:17.603
and Pune people are the known Maharashtrians

00:36:17.684 --> 00:36:18.784
to be great

00:36:19.423 --> 00:36:21.459
miserly, kanjoos people.

00:36:24.368 --> 00:36:26.268
Even for their own

00:36:26.923 --> 00:36:30.478
ashram, they would like Me to pay for everything.

00:36:31.330 --> 00:36:33.834
and they nicely go and sing bhajans nicely.

00:36:34.238 --> 00:36:36.480
See they are good musicians, that is what they are.

00:36:37.483 --> 00:36:39.891
Very very miserly people.

00:36:45.576 --> 00:36:47.524
Miserly people can never love.

00:36:47.589 --> 00:36:48.689
Tthey love money.

00:36:50.224 --> 00:36:52.473
Egoistical people can never love

00:36:52.578 --> 00:36:54.415
because they love power

00:36:54.836 --> 00:36:55.936
to control others.

00:36:59.628 --> 00:37:01.904
They think theey are doing for Sahajyoga.

00:37:02.525 --> 00:37:03.625
but not.

00:37:03.735 --> 00:37:07.334
Unless until you do something for yourself and ego

00:37:07.809 --> 00:37:09.757
no use working for Sahajyoga.

00:37:13.433 --> 00:37:14.611
Look at The Christ

00:37:15.386 --> 00:37:17.490
He took birth in a very humble

00:37:18.081 --> 00:37:19.181
abode.

00:37:20.943 --> 00:37:22.327
But He was the king.

00:37:24.361 --> 00:37:25.881
And He lived with the poor

00:37:29.810 --> 00:37:31.107
and tried to save them.

00:37:31.205 --> 00:37:32.383
He saved the lepers.

00:37:32.584 --> 00:37:34.599
He saved so many people, there were.

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:38.785
Twenty one people were cured by Him.

00:37:38.986 --> 00:37:42.419
Now sahaj yoga I don't know, how many thousands have been cured.

00:37:46.583 --> 00:37:49.074
But what is important is if you are curing

00:37:49.447 --> 00:37:51.801
you know that you are not curing

00:37:51.814 --> 00:37:54.583
It is the Divine power that is curing.

00:37:56.893 --> 00:37:58.476
You are not doing anything

00:38:00.117 --> 00:38:01.217
It is best to be like that.

00:38:01.938 --> 00:38:04.243
I feel the same way that I am doing nothing

00:38:04.885 --> 00:38:05.985
and I am Nishkriya

00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:07.740
doing nothing.

00:38:09.017 --> 00:38:10.386
but I am not lazy.

00:38:14.188 --> 00:38:14.928
You should be active

00:38:15.129 --> 00:38:16.878
but all your activity

00:38:17.206 --> 00:38:20.649
should come from the Divine power of 'Love'

00:38:21.513 --> 00:38:24.548
First of all you must extend your hands for l'ove'.

00:38:25.348 --> 00:38:26.624
You extend your heart

00:38:26.743 --> 00:38:27.843
extend your money

00:38:27.912 --> 00:38:31.045
house, everything for 'Love'

00:38:33.329 --> 00:38:34.529
Now once your wife

00:38:34.988 --> 00:38:36.089
doesn't allow others to come in

00:38:36.116 --> 00:38:38.467
throw her out of the house, I don't mind.

00:38:41.384 --> 00:38:42.484
Teach her

00:38:43.185 --> 00:38:45.160
how to be kind and generous

00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:46.819
otherway round for the husband.

00:38:48.369 --> 00:38:49.469
It is very important

00:38:50.183 --> 00:38:51.639
you have to be generous.

00:38:52.172 --> 00:38:54.945
You have to be kind, you have to be loving

00:38:55.539 --> 00:38:56.639
and sweet to others.

00:38:58.431 --> 00:39:00.502
Christ only once went into temper

00:39:00.703 --> 00:39:02.477
which He had a right to do that

00:39:02.808 --> 00:39:03.908
when He saw people

00:39:04.276 --> 00:39:06.105
selling things in the temple.

00:39:07.649 --> 00:39:08.930
Samething we have here.

00:39:10.497 --> 00:39:12.854
And if you don't go and buy anything from them

00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:14.449
they will be lost.

00:39:16.113 --> 00:39:18.845
But you only go and buy things from them because

00:39:19.072 --> 00:39:20.631
you have a habit of shopping.

00:39:21.158 --> 00:39:22.258
Anywhere they

00:39:22.628 --> 00:39:23.992
people go, they must shop

00:39:24.741 --> 00:39:25.841
is a habit

00:39:27.114 --> 00:39:28.581
shopping they must do.

00:39:28.664 --> 00:39:30.453
They will not see the greenery

00:39:30.592 --> 00:39:32.397
the beauty of nature, nothing.

00:39:33.598 --> 00:39:37.226
When I went to so many countries,you see I had to

00:39:38.089 --> 00:39:39.458
with my husband

00:39:40.321 --> 00:39:42.261
I had to go

00:39:42.553 --> 00:39:45.435
and see beautiful places like museums.

00:39:46.077 --> 00:39:47.177
I never used to shop.

00:39:48.238 --> 00:39:50.202
But when I have so many children

00:39:50.618 --> 00:39:51.718
then I have to shop.

00:39:52.128 --> 00:39:53.425
So I would go for shops.

00:39:54.226 --> 00:39:56.111
But not the way that

00:39:56.147 --> 00:39:58.135
that every place is for shopping.

00:39:58.919 --> 00:40:00.425
What is there to shop here

00:40:00.733 --> 00:40:03.980
when you have come here for your spiritual growth.

00:40:05.643 --> 00:40:07.932
In Mecca, do they have any shops?

00:40:11.928 --> 00:40:13.725
This is the holier than holi.

00:40:14.978 --> 00:40:17.331
Why should go to the shops ? I can't understand.

00:40:17.767 --> 00:40:18.667
I have told them

00:40:19.601 --> 00:40:20.507
not to have shops

00:40:20.708 --> 00:40:24.025
but you people are the ones, who encourage.

00:40:25.352 --> 00:40:28.173
who encouraged them to make money out of us ?

00:40:30.812 --> 00:40:32.799
Nothing essential to buy there.

00:40:34.089 --> 00:40:37.979
Now you have come to the holy occassion.

00:40:38.313 --> 00:40:41.827
Here you have come for your worship.

00:40:44.661 --> 00:40:46.911
In our Mahalaxmi temple

00:40:47.112 --> 00:40:49.358
there are people who are selling

00:40:49.559 --> 00:40:52.155
garlands and things for ladies' hair.

00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:54.326
But they say it is for the Goddess.

00:40:55.499 --> 00:40:56.599
And they buy there.

00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.461
All the people who are coming stupidly

00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:02.465
and give it

00:41:02.967 --> 00:41:04.891
to the brahmin in the temple

00:41:05.289 --> 00:41:07.316
and the Brahmin sells it back

00:41:08.130 --> 00:41:09.230
at a lower price.

00:41:09.919 --> 00:41:12.454
And these garlands are

00:41:12.901 --> 00:41:15.182
I don't know how many times sold and bought

00:41:15.314 --> 00:41:17.401
and sold and bought because of the

00:41:17.602 --> 00:41:19.808
stupidity of the people who go there.

00:41:20.841 --> 00:41:22.343
If they have to take something

00:41:22.544 --> 00:41:24.195
they should buy it from outside,

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:27.338
not at the place where you have come.

00:41:33.414 --> 00:41:36.838
As it is you went to Delhi, you could have bought it there.

00:41:38.399 --> 00:41:39.960
or you came to Bombay

00:41:40.173 --> 00:41:42.859
you could have bought there but not in this place.

00:41:43.151 --> 00:41:46.525
We cannot make this place Bombay or Delhi

00:41:46.823 --> 00:41:48.914
otherwise why should we come here.

00:41:50.276 --> 00:41:52.097
That is why christ took a hunter

00:41:54.229 --> 00:41:58.486
and beat them those who were selling things near the church.

00:42:01.277 --> 00:42:02.377
Now they don't have

00:42:03.056 --> 00:42:05.658
I have seen, near the church they don't have.

00:42:05.859 --> 00:42:07.190
They have outside.

00:42:09.812 --> 00:42:11.394
But they sell other things

00:42:11.952 --> 00:42:14.908
like catholic church sells

00:42:15.559 --> 00:42:18.309
a wine called Benedictine.

00:42:18.510 --> 00:42:18.936
 Imagine !

00:42:20.761 --> 00:42:21.861
That is another story.

00:42:23.710 --> 00:42:24.810
Christ went

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:29.690
for wedding

00:42:31.691 --> 00:42:34.018
and they had no wine.

00:42:34.519 --> 00:42:36.137
Now in the Hibru language

00:42:36.363 --> 00:42:37.521
wine

00:42:37.722 --> 00:42:39.224
means

00:42:39.640 --> 00:42:42.094
the juice of the grapes.

00:42:42.295 --> 00:42:43.800
It doesn't mean fermented.

00:42:46.094 --> 00:42:48.883
So He converted water into black wine.

00:42:50.349 --> 00:42:51.631
You cannot convert

00:42:52.787 --> 00:42:55.442
water instatantaneously

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.383
into wine.

00:42:57.605 --> 00:43:00.093
Wine has to rot , has to smell

00:43:00.133 --> 00:43:02.565
The more it smells, the best it is.

00:43:04.569 --> 00:43:08.445
But they think that Christ said you must drink this thing.

00:43:11.112 --> 00:43:12.212
He never said that.

00:43:13.592 --> 00:43:17.423
He just converted it into wine.

00:43:17.784 --> 00:43:18.643
meaning

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:19.895
the

00:43:20.096 --> 00:43:23.987
taste of the juice of grapes.

00:43:24.683 --> 00:43:25.783
Once I went

00:43:26.728 --> 00:43:27.987
to some television

00:43:28.614 --> 00:43:31.681
and there was a very nice man in Italy.

00:43:31.895 --> 00:43:35.873
He said ,''Mother you first give me realisation''.

00:43:36.461 --> 00:43:39.064
So I said ,''Get some Water''. I put My hand into it.

00:43:39.607 --> 00:43:40.570
" Now you drink it".

00:43:40.872 --> 00:43:43.802
He said ,"It is tasting like wine".

00:43:44.205 --> 00:43:46.304
I said,"This is what Christ did".

00:43:47.268 --> 00:43:48.801
He got his realisation.

00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:52.041
Instantaneously, you cannot make wine.

00:43:53.359 --> 00:43:56.819
But if somebody dies, they will drink.

00:43:57.652 --> 00:43:59.830
If somebody is born, they will drink.

00:44:00.387 --> 00:44:03.724
At any cost, without drinking they are not normal.

00:44:09.908 --> 00:44:12.715
But the people who got realisation are suddenly changed.

00:44:12.933 --> 00:44:13.920
They don't want to drink.

00:44:13.945 --> 00:44:15.236
They have stopped drinking.

00:44:15.507 --> 00:44:17.296
Their attention has become nice.

00:44:17.607 --> 00:44:19.279
The whole thing is changed.

00:44:19.771 --> 00:44:22.032
This is the transformation that has worked

00:44:23.237 --> 00:44:26.018
of which Christ has talked, Mohammed sahib has talked

00:44:26.366 --> 00:44:29.290
everybody has talked about this particular time

00:44:29.491 --> 00:44:32.074
 when people will get transformed.

00:44:32.446 --> 00:44:34.671
But even after transformation

00:44:35.091 --> 00:44:38.372
you do not want to become what you have to be

00:44:40.299 --> 00:44:41.620
for which you have come here.

00:44:43.798 --> 00:44:45.111
You will be left behind.

00:44:45.841 --> 00:44:46.741
It is a big

00:44:55.823 --> 00:44:57.493
transformation is taking place.

00:44:59.273 --> 00:45:02.239
In that transformation also your rising is taking place.

00:45:03.340 --> 00:45:06.073
There is a big evolution going on

00:45:06.482 --> 00:45:09.332
and those who will not evolve properly

00:45:09.523 --> 00:45:10.856
will be left behind.

00:45:14.634 --> 00:45:18.336
As it is said that, it is the last judgement.

00:45:20.192 --> 00:45:21.392
And you will be judged.

00:45:22.077 --> 00:45:23.795
You will be left behind.

00:45:24.845 --> 00:45:27.793
You cannot adhere to people who are rising higher.

00:45:28.733 --> 00:45:30.704
With your weight you will fall down.

00:45:32.797 --> 00:45:34.431
So for you

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:37.404
to understand Christ

00:45:37.642 --> 00:45:40.463
is all these qualities you must have.

00:45:41.370 --> 00:45:45.405
If you are hot tempered , alright , go and beat yourself with shoes.

00:45:46.173 --> 00:45:48.653
But if you are not, then you need not.

00:45:50.137 --> 00:45:51.176
You must know what you are.

00:45:51.377 --> 00:45:52.698
First of all introspect.

00:45:52.971 --> 00:45:55.253
Accordingly you should work it out.

00:45:55.452 --> 00:45:59.207
But this ritualism is not allwed in Sahajyoga all the time.

00:46:16.664 --> 00:46:19.381
I would love all my children.

00:46:21.135 --> 00:46:24.116
To be extremely loving and collective.

00:46:25.820 --> 00:46:27.824
Not to denounce anybody

00:46:28.666 --> 00:46:30.058
for no rhyme and reason

00:46:30.416 --> 00:46:32.848
and if you have to denounce, you should tell Me.

00:46:33.147 --> 00:46:35.016
I know what is what !

00:46:35.697 --> 00:46:39.032
Without asking Me, you should not measure up somebody

00:46:39.146 --> 00:46:40.701
and say i have measured somebody.

00:46:40.902 --> 00:46:42.838
With what ? what is your yardstick ?

00:46:45.573 --> 00:46:49.553
You yourself you are caught up in the web of ego.

00:46:51.696 --> 00:46:53.686
You cannot condemn anyone

00:46:54.082 --> 00:46:54.982
without telling Me.

00:46:55.759 --> 00:46:56.859
You have to tell me.

00:46:57.373 --> 00:47:00.283
Don't worry that this thing will disturb Me or anything

00:47:00.484 --> 00:47:01.720
but you should ask.

00:47:02.250 --> 00:47:03.833
I know about everyone.

00:47:04.138 --> 00:47:07.705
May be I have not mat that person but i can feel the vibrations.

00:47:10.325 --> 00:47:11.725
You can write to me.

00:47:12.433 --> 00:47:14.786
Many people just telephone, that is not the way.

00:47:15.301 --> 00:47:19.053
You must write to Me because I read each and every letter.

00:47:19.594 --> 00:47:22.312
But all nonsensical letters you should not write also

00:47:22.488 --> 00:47:23.721
to waste my time.

00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:29.186
.....like my father's mother's, mother, this thing

00:47:29.387 --> 00:47:34.456
is sick or is dead and her bhoot is moving about.

00:47:37.918 --> 00:47:40.716
All sorts of funny letters come to Me.

00:47:40.917 --> 00:47:42.494
What can I do for such people ?

00:47:43.066 --> 00:47:43.916
That is not important.

00:47:44.117 --> 00:47:46.883
All i need money, I have no money.

00:47:47.084 --> 00:47:52.080
I am depending on you for money. So please send me money.

00:47:54.586 --> 00:47:56.764
You can ask on my photograph.

00:47:58.596 --> 00:48:01.837
If you are a good Sahajyogi, you don't have to worry for money also.

00:48:05.322 --> 00:48:08.074
Or i have no child ,Mother what to do?

00:48:08.275 --> 00:48:09.370
Mother i want to have a child.

00:48:09.785 --> 00:48:12.754
Those who have child, ask them what do else they have to say.

00:48:14.941 --> 00:48:18.569
So many have got children after coming to Sahajyoga

00:48:18.638 --> 00:48:20.578
but you must deserve it.

00:48:25.784 --> 00:48:29.351
So many miracles have taken place.

00:48:29.547 --> 00:48:32.940
So many people have been cured no doubt.

00:48:34.138 --> 00:48:36.475
But that doesn't mean that you have done it.

00:48:38.253 --> 00:48:42.245
Don't get into the trap of ego.

00:48:45.022 --> 00:48:47.145
That is most dangerous.

00:48:47.921 --> 00:48:51.933
If you destroy sahajyoga, you are destroying yourself.

00:48:57.322 --> 00:49:00.739
So, today you all have to promise in your heart.

00:49:01.883 --> 00:49:03.808
Put your hands to your heart

00:49:04.205 --> 00:49:05.105
and to say

00:49:06.165 --> 00:49:08.414
''Mother, We love,

00:49:09.830 --> 00:49:12.259
We spread your Divine Love,

00:49:12.866 --> 00:49:14.988
encompass the whole world,

00:49:15.525 --> 00:49:17.772
give realisation to all the people.

00:49:18.504 --> 00:49:19.604
Will not shout,

00:49:20.779 --> 00:49:22.102
will not be angry,

00:49:22.507 --> 00:49:28.341
will not do the all kinds of rituals but just surrender.

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:30.872
Surrender our ego

00:49:31.611 --> 00:49:32.511
surrender ego

00:49:32.926 --> 00:49:34.452
surrender your ego.

00:49:34.699 --> 00:49:36.832
All your problems can be solved.

00:49:37.257 --> 00:49:39.142
because, as long as, there is ego

00:49:39.462 --> 00:49:41.767
this divine power doesn't take over.

00:49:42.491 --> 00:49:43.591
You may do anything

00:49:43.998 --> 00:49:46.668
You are not connected. Your connection is missing.

00:49:47.935 --> 00:49:50.232
Christ is missing. He is no more.

00:49:52.654 --> 00:49:57.512
To establish Him first of all you must show how you love.

00:49:57.844 --> 00:49:58.215
That doesn't mean

00:49:58.416 --> 00:50:01.957
that you love your wife,love your children and love your house.

00:50:04.497 --> 00:50:06.584
You have to love everyone.

00:50:08.046 --> 00:50:10.772
Try to make everyone happy.

00:50:11.957 --> 00:50:13.406
That is why I like music

00:50:13.481 --> 00:50:16.595
because through music you can spread vibrations.

00:50:17.856 --> 00:50:20.764
Very good media of spreading vibrations

00:50:21.756 --> 00:50:22.856
of loving vibrations.

00:50:23.735 --> 00:50:27.818
But those who are musicians have to be loving people,

00:50:29.791 --> 00:50:30.858
not hot tempered

00:50:32.732 --> 00:50:33.732
not showing off

00:50:35.869 --> 00:50:38.627
not thinking too much of themselves.

00:50:40.085 --> 00:50:41.461
All these will work

00:50:42.252 --> 00:50:44.269
very well if you understand

00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:47.483
that this Divine power

00:50:47.684 --> 00:50:49.592
is so powerful.

00:50:51.574 --> 00:50:52.674
No doubt it is love,

00:50:53.468 --> 00:50:55.892
no doubt it is truth,

00:50:56.814 --> 00:50:58.468
 and no doubt

00:51:00.175 --> 00:51:04.079
if you get out of it, you will be caught up by anything

00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:06.263
and you could be finished.

00:51:08.605 --> 00:51:10.879
It is a very very

00:51:12.064 --> 00:51:17.149
powerful, effective and absolutely conclusive

00:51:18.325 --> 00:51:20.638
power you have within yourself.

00:51:21.760 --> 00:51:24.542
And thanks to christ that crucified Himself

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:27.335
sacrificed his body for our sake

00:51:27.603 --> 00:51:29.075
that our agnya is opened up.

00:51:29.276 --> 00:51:31.672
Otherwise I could not have done this Sahajyoga.

00:51:33.995 --> 00:51:35.633
But in this area

00:51:35.834 --> 00:51:39.087
we have Buddha, Christ and Mahavira.

00:51:41.506 --> 00:51:44.120
and they had to do tapasya, tapaha.

00:51:44.606 --> 00:51:45.524
They did it.

00:51:45.725 --> 00:51:49.261
You don't have to do now, they have done for you.

00:51:54.047 --> 00:51:56.495
Now see I saw the musicians yesterday.

00:51:56.696 --> 00:51:59.004
In two three months they have learnt so much,

00:51:59.268 --> 00:52:02.288
otherwise formerly  all the musicians I knew.

00:52:02.489 --> 00:52:03.836
For Indian music

00:52:04.716 --> 00:52:06.458
had to really starve.

00:52:07.028 --> 00:52:09.271
For months together they had to practice

00:52:09.472 --> 00:52:13.188
 years together, they had to bow to their guru.

00:52:13.389 --> 00:52:15.348
That is all over now.

00:52:17.814 --> 00:52:19.953
because of this Param Chaitanya

00:52:20.154 --> 00:52:21.978
and your power

00:52:23.202 --> 00:52:25.560
to be one with the Divine.

00:52:25.761 --> 00:52:29.341
This Divine power can transform you completely

00:52:29.572 --> 00:52:31.255
to such an extent

00:52:31.456 --> 00:52:33.301
that anything that you want to do,

00:52:33.502 --> 00:52:35.293
you can do it in two, three months.

00:52:37.256 --> 00:52:39.411
In Pune when they were singing

00:52:39.876 --> 00:52:42.490
'foreigners' as we call them with respect.

00:52:42.688 --> 00:52:45.914
In India 'foreigners' means respect , not like other countries.

00:52:47.327 --> 00:52:48.526
So they were singing.

00:52:48.727 --> 00:52:52.407
They were some very great musicians (who) had come.

00:52:53.059 --> 00:52:56.380
They told  Me,"Mother, we put down our head to them."

00:52:56.741 --> 00:52:58.585
Because how could these people

00:52:58.786 --> 00:53:03.219
who don't know a word about Indian music have learnt it so well

00:53:03.330 --> 00:53:06.674
and the pronunciation of these Marathi languages were difficult.

00:53:06.861 --> 00:53:08.814
But they are so good at it

00:53:09.015 --> 00:53:10.620
is very surprising.

00:53:12.302 --> 00:53:16.218
Now all this has happened in your presence,

00:53:17.642 --> 00:53:18.742
in your presence.

00:53:20.094 --> 00:53:21.963
It is nice here, you have balloons here.

00:53:22.947 --> 00:53:24.942
to celebrate Christ's birthday.

00:53:25.035 --> 00:53:28.327
and all these balloons of your ego should be burst,

00:53:28.938 --> 00:53:30.038
should be finished.

00:53:32.148 --> 00:53:38.492
(clapping)

00:53:43.963 --> 00:53:47.093
I will be happy if you could learn Hindi language.

00:53:48.149 --> 00:53:50.950
But I know My English may not be so good

00:53:51.093 --> 00:53:54.076
but best is to learn hindi,

00:53:55.090 --> 00:53:57.004
if possible.

00:53:57.205 --> 00:54:01.521
Because there are already fourteen languages in India

00:54:02.471 --> 00:54:05.073
and so many languages in another country.

00:54:06.092 --> 00:54:08.905
Every country has a different type of English language.

00:54:09.459 --> 00:54:12.997
If you go to America, I don't understand their English

00:54:13.061 --> 00:54:14.161
for at least two, three days.

00:54:14.545 --> 00:54:16.072
Because they go on

00:54:16.273 --> 00:54:17.734
taking their

00:54:17.935 --> 00:54:19.732
....tongue

00:54:20.217 --> 00:54:23.689
and lips on one side, then on another side.

00:54:29.688 --> 00:54:32.846
English of the French is another point.

00:54:33.047 --> 00:54:35.131
So best is to learn Hindi.

00:54:35.332 --> 00:54:39.878
and that too a good Hindi, not Sanskritized.

00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:43.535
But as they say (Rozmara) i.e., day- to- day- Hindi because

00:54:43.870 --> 00:54:47.096
I feel better if you understand what I am saying.

00:54:47.449 --> 00:54:49.480
It is not difficult because you are all sahajyogis.

00:54:49.681 --> 00:54:52.141
You can learn Hindi in no time. I am not saying you learn Sanskrit.

00:54:52.518 --> 00:54:53.887
But Hindi is very easy.

00:54:54.313 --> 00:54:56.155
Try to (learn Hindi). It is not My Mother tongue.

00:54:56.356 --> 00:54:58.835
I have never studied Hindi language, never.

00:54:59.286 --> 00:55:02.815
But you see it is a very easy language to learn.

00:55:03.569 --> 00:55:08.322
But as My father told Me ,"Never teach Hindi language

00:55:08.762 --> 00:55:10.257
to an English man."

00:55:12.882 --> 00:55:14.624
I said," Why this advise ?"

00:55:15.223 --> 00:55:17.612
He said," There was an English man who was after me

00:55:17.813 --> 00:55:19.486
that i should teach him Hindi."

00:55:20.551 --> 00:55:24.476
so he said," I have to tell my servant to open the door

00:55:26.079 --> 00:55:27.488
or to close the door.''

00:55:29.306 --> 00:55:32.028
So for open the door he said you say

00:55:32.816 --> 00:55:38.076
'there was a cool day', means 'Darwaza khol de'

00:55:43.309 --> 00:55:51.332
(clapping)

00:55:51.541 --> 00:55:55.838
And for closing the door, you have to say, 'There was a banker'

00:55:57.698 --> 00:56:01.165
"Maine darwaza bandh kar dey" (means close the door)

00:56:03.501 --> 00:56:05.201
But now it is different.

00:56:06.891 --> 00:56:09.759
They will pick up Hindi very quickly.

00:56:11.066 --> 00:56:12.792
Very quickly, I can see that.

00:56:13.011 --> 00:56:17.920
If you can learn this horrible Indian classical music

00:56:18.073 --> 00:56:21.846
which is so difficult, so easily, what will happen ?

00:56:22.738 --> 00:56:26.455
They can learn Hindi in no time and make Me happier every time.

00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:29.486
Not because Hindi is My language- It is not, it is Marathi.

00:56:29.768 --> 00:56:32.563
Marathi is very difficult. I don't think you can learn Marathi.

00:56:32.996 --> 00:56:34.096
It is very precise.

00:56:34.631 --> 00:56:36.747
I think that is one of the best languages

00:56:36.978 --> 00:56:39.410
to put down your ego.

00:56:41.391 --> 00:56:44.085
That is why Maharashtrians are normally not egoistical,

00:56:44.317 --> 00:56:47.654
because in their language it is built in process.

00:56:48.196 --> 00:56:50.565
For example somebody is boasting,

00:56:52.586 --> 00:56:54.828
that I have done this, I have done that.

00:56:55.168 --> 00:56:59.866
So in Marathi they will say, " Don't climb on a bush."

00:57:00.112 --> 00:57:05.090
or what we call the tree of channa which is so big as that.

00:57:06.912 --> 00:57:08.312
Then the person is finished.

00:57:08.781 --> 00:57:11.221
Like that there are many words by which

00:57:11.423 --> 00:57:14.526
you can put down the ego of the man on his face.

00:57:14.663 --> 00:57:18.079
So Marathi language has so many advantages.

00:57:18.337 --> 00:57:20.552
but I would not ask you to learn Marathi language.

00:57:20.753 --> 00:57:21.939
 It is not so easy.

00:57:22.617 --> 00:57:26.884
But Hindi you should. It is very easy, very easy.

00:57:27.085 --> 00:57:31.132
 but you must know one  thing that in Hindi language

00:57:31.912 --> 00:57:32.921
 there is 'Adab'.

00:57:33.390 --> 00:57:35.488
'Adab' means

00:57:35.689 --> 00:57:37.195
modesty

00:57:37.396 --> 00:57:39.053
and

00:57:42.022 --> 00:57:43.122
respect

00:57:43.754 --> 00:57:48.428
respect, but more than respect it is a style of saying.

00:57:49.515 --> 00:57:53.134
Not ' Urdu ' but Hindi of day - to- day talking

00:57:53.428 --> 00:57:57.044
there is respect and a way to address others,

00:57:58.815 --> 00:58:00.135
to address others.

00:58:00.336 --> 00:58:01.254
All this

00:58:02.326 --> 00:58:03.426
will give you

00:58:04.362 --> 00:58:07.948
a kind of a more

00:58:09.365 --> 00:58:11.226
flexible vehichle

00:58:12.520 --> 00:58:14.151
to express your love.

00:58:15.378 --> 00:58:19.344
Because in Hindi language we can never translate 'I hate you'.

00:58:19.398 --> 00:58:20.398
We never say like that.

00:58:21.421 --> 00:58:22.421
I hate you.

00:58:23.247 --> 00:58:25.899
'I hate you' will anybody say like that ?

00:58:27.710 --> 00:58:28.988
We cannot say.

00:58:29.189 --> 00:58:31.428
To hate somebody is sinful.

00:58:32.832 --> 00:58:34.564
So they can never say,'I hate you.'

00:58:40.027 --> 00:58:42.477
Chastity is more in Marathi language

00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:43.552
but it is a little hard

00:58:43.941 --> 00:58:46.851
because it has got such as I told you

00:58:47.392 --> 00:58:52.208
......idioms which can correct you just there.

00:58:54.253 --> 00:58:57.952
All this is just to request now if you can learn this

00:58:59.487 --> 00:59:00.487
music,

00:59:01.497 --> 00:59:02.497
which is very difficult.

00:59:03.432 --> 00:59:06.339
You can always learn a simple Hindi language

00:59:07.087 --> 00:59:11.265
which is very very easy and very very easy to talk.

00:59:19.443 --> 00:59:23.354
There are so many things , I would like you to know about Christ

00:59:23.876 --> 00:59:24.876
But this is

00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.047
short time in which I cannot tell you.

00:59:29.878 --> 00:59:32.919
The way He had His own priorities.

00:59:37.481 --> 00:59:40.075
Though in the Bible He is not described fully,

00:59:40.276 --> 00:59:42.285
I should say and whatever it might have been

00:59:42.669 --> 00:59:44.167
They have reduced it.

00:59:45.480 --> 00:59:46.480
May be,

00:59:46.671 --> 00:59:49.786
and the way they practice Christianity is shocking.

00:59:50.497 --> 00:59:56.758
So one has to learn Christianity through the heart.

00:59:57.213 --> 00:59:58.213
No other way out.

00:59:59.886 --> 01:00:01.390
They should learn through the Heart,

01:00:01.591 --> 01:00:04.035
 Heart of your Mother.

01:00:06.021 --> 01:00:07.021
May God bless you !
