00:00:00.041 --> 00:00:04.260
Easter Puja. Istanbul - Turkey
22 April 2001.

00:05:16.993 --> 00:05:20.993
Today we have gathered here

00:05:22.452 --> 00:05:26.452
to do the puja of Easter.

00:05:28.368 --> 00:05:32.368
In the history of spirituality,

00:05:33.035 --> 00:05:35.243
it is one of the greatest days

00:05:35.993 --> 00:05:42.410
when we find Christ rose from the dead.

00:05:45.118 --> 00:05:48.076
It is very significant and symbolic

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.368
that in Sahaja Yoga, also

00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:54.160
what we have done,

00:05:54.410 --> 00:06:00.243
is to rise from the dead – into life.

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.410
It is to be understood

00:06:03.993 --> 00:06:07.993
that resurrection is the message for all of us,

00:06:08.951 --> 00:06:10.452
for the whole world.

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.201
We have to resurrect ourselves.

00:06:14.243 --> 00:06:21.327
There was no need for Jesus to do that.

00:06:22.201 --> 00:06:26.118
But He was a model, model of a saint,

00:06:26.327 --> 00:06:29.118
model of a realised soul,

00:06:29.285 --> 00:06:33.285
model of a person who came all the way

00:06:33.535 --> 00:06:35.535
from the heavens to save us.

00:06:36.993 --> 00:06:39.035
So this resurrection is also

00:06:39.118 --> 00:06:42.035
part and parcel of our lives.

00:06:43.993 --> 00:06:47.993
It is so symbolic, so very symbolic,

00:06:48.993 --> 00:06:51.035
that we were,

00:06:53.951 --> 00:06:56.993
in our consciousness, lost people.

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.993
We had no control over ourselves

00:07:01.951 --> 00:07:04.951
as to know the way our mind told us to go.

00:07:05.118 --> 00:07:07.993
We had no balance with the mind

00:07:08.118 --> 00:07:10.118
and our physical being,

00:07:11.076 --> 00:07:13.993
no balance of any kind in life

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.160
and used to go at random,

00:07:16.993 --> 00:07:19.076
whichever way we thought was good.

00:07:20.076 --> 00:07:22.160
There was no wisdom about it.

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:29.160
As it is, Jesus was the incarnation of Shri Ganesha.

00:07:30.993 --> 00:07:33.993
It’s a very difficult task He has performed.

00:07:34.951 --> 00:07:36.160
He used to convince people

00:07:36.951 --> 00:07:39.951
who were absolutely ignorant about spirituality,

00:07:41.076 --> 00:07:45.076
who just knew about money and nothing else.

00:07:45.951 --> 00:07:47.951
He came in those days

00:07:48.076 --> 00:07:53.951
when people had no idea about spirituality at all, at all.

00:07:54.035 --> 00:07:56.951
But, somehow,

00:07:57.035 --> 00:07:59.035
it all worked out

00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:01.993
in such a beautiful manner

00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:06.035
that people have started understanding

00:08:06.076 --> 00:08:11.160
that He communicated that resurrection is the important point.

00:08:13.951 --> 00:08:15.993
He knew when the resurrection takes place,

00:08:17.035 --> 00:08:19.035
the Kundalini rises

00:08:19.118 --> 00:08:23.035
and connects you to the Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

00:08:23.993 --> 00:08:26.035
Then you start understanding

00:08:26.076 --> 00:08:28.076
that there’s a life beyond

00:08:28.951 --> 00:08:30.951
the life that you have made.

00:08:31.118 --> 00:08:33.118
There’s another type of life,

00:08:33.951 --> 00:08:39.118
a higher type of life, which connects you to the Divine Power.

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:45.160
And then this Divine Power gives you the Absolute Truth.

00:08:46.243 --> 00:08:49.035
If you grow more and more,

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:51.951
you will know Absolute Truth

00:08:52.076 --> 00:08:54.035
because so far you don’t know.

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.076
So we have been doing wrong things,

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.076
going in the wrong way, getting lost.

00:08:59.951 --> 00:09:03.118
Also we were listening to people who were just boasting

00:09:03.951 --> 00:09:06.951
and were saying they know about the Truth.

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:09.951
But when you yourself discover the Truth,

00:09:09.993 --> 00:09:11.993
you are a different person.

00:09:12.951 --> 00:09:17.910
You discovery is so innate and so real

00:09:17.951 --> 00:09:20.951
that you discard all that is unreal.

00:09:21.035 --> 00:09:22.993
Very easily you can discard it

00:09:23.076 --> 00:09:26.951
and you don’t find it difficult to get rid of it.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.951
In this conference, as you know, we have more of Muslim people,

00:09:33.951 --> 00:09:38.951
Islamic people, who have been so much misguided all over the world.

00:09:39.076 --> 00:09:42.076
They have been told all kinds of stories

00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:45.951
and hatred among people or others.

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.951
This Islamic bhoots

00:09:49.035 --> 00:09:51.035
is going from bad to worse

00:09:51.201 --> 00:09:53.951
and people want to believe in it.

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:57.993
Especially in my country there’s a very, very big problem

00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:02.035
with this Islamic influence

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:04.951
because they are nowhere near Islam,

00:10:05.035 --> 00:10:07.076
they have nothing to do with Mohammed-sahib,

00:10:08.243 --> 00:10:10.243
but they are thinking

00:10:10.951 --> 00:10:13.160
that they are correct and what they are doing is correct.

00:10:14.035 --> 00:10:18.076
They’re trying to spread Muslim religion.

00:10:19.076 --> 00:10:22.076
What’s the use? What’s the purpose? I can’t understand.

00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:25.160
Unless and until you get your realisation,

00:10:25.951 --> 00:10:28.951
you are a useless human being, good for nothing.

00:10:29.076 --> 00:10:32.076
You can hate others, you can beat others,

00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.160
you can kill others and it’s going on all over the place.

00:10:36.993 --> 00:10:40.160
Surprising thing that all this nonsense is going on

00:10:40.993 --> 00:10:43.993
everywhere in the world in the name of Mohammed-sahib.

00:10:44.993 --> 00:10:49.076
So in one shot, one side you put Christ

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:51.118
for another crucifixion,

00:10:51.951 --> 00:10:55.035
on the other side Mohammed-sahib for his crucifixion.

00:10:55.076 --> 00:10:56.951
They cannot fight, you see.

00:10:57.035 --> 00:11:02.951
They’re on the same line. They’re on the same understanding.

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:04.951
How can they fight? But

00:11:05.035 --> 00:11:07.993
their disciples are fighting so badly all over

00:11:08.076 --> 00:11:10.951
that sometimes it really breaks you,

00:11:11.035 --> 00:11:15.951
when you only hear about how people are fighting for nonsense.

00:11:21.118 --> 00:11:26.035
In His life, Christ did not marry.

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:31.951
He did not and He never needed also.

00:11:32.035 --> 00:11:33.951
He did not marry.

00:11:34.035 --> 00:11:37.076
And at a very young age He was crucified.

00:11:38.951 --> 00:11:43.035
That crucifixion shows that He was not afraid of death

00:11:44.035 --> 00:11:46.910
and He knew that He would resurrect Himself.

00:11:46.993 --> 00:11:50.993
This He had to do through the Agnya Chakra.

00:11:51.076 --> 00:11:53.118
Agnya Chakra is, as you know, is very constricted.

00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:56.993
And through that constriction He had to go through,

00:11:57.035 --> 00:12:00.076
for which He had to get killed.

00:12:00.951 --> 00:12:04.951
And He accepted that. He accepted

00:12:06.035 --> 00:12:10.951
with full heart that that’s the ordeal He has to go through.

00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:14.160
In the same way, your Sahasrara

00:12:14.243 --> 00:12:16.951
can be only achieved through the Agnya

00:12:17.035 --> 00:12:19.035
and the Agnya has to be opened out.

00:12:19.951 --> 00:12:23.951
But for that, you don’t have to get hanged,

00:12:24.076 --> 00:12:26.951
you don’t have to be crucified,

00:12:27.076 --> 00:12:30.951
but you have to crucify your ego.

00:12:31.035 --> 00:12:33.035
The first point is ego.

00:12:33.951 --> 00:12:38.076
You have such ego that you cannot get rid of it.

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:42.118
We have subtle and subtle ways of having egos

00:12:42.951 --> 00:12:45.951
like “I have come from this country, I must have ego,”

00:12:45.951 --> 00:12:49.951
“I come from this kind of family, I must have ego.”

00:12:50.035 --> 00:12:52.951
All kinds of stupid things they do,

00:12:52.993 --> 00:12:55.118
which are really sinful and they think

00:12:55.201 --> 00:12:57.201
they’re very great that they have ego.

00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:00.951
This ego, you have to fight,

00:13:00.993 --> 00:13:03.993
otherwise your resurrection is not possible,

00:13:04.118 --> 00:13:09.951
your attention cannot pass through the Agnya Chakra.

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.160
As long as they have given us satanic identifications,

00:13:13.243 --> 00:13:16.993
it will not work out. It’s a very subtle happening

00:13:17.076 --> 00:13:22.118
— very, very subtle happening — that you should see your own ego.

00:13:22.951 --> 00:13:25.951
After Realisation I said, 'You know yourself.’

00:13:26.076 --> 00:13:29.160
The first thing you will know is that you have too much of

00:13:29.951 --> 00:13:32.035
conditioning and too much of ego.

00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:36.951
Like in India, I find people have so much conditioning

00:13:37.035 --> 00:13:41.076
of their so-called rituals — very ritualistic.

00:13:41.993 --> 00:13:45.993
Everything is a ritual with them and they cannot get out of it.

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:48.076
That’s all the conditioning is,

00:13:48.201 --> 00:13:52.076
but ego is the worst part in the West, more in the West,

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.951
where I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.910
In that ego they get lost.

00:13:58.951 --> 00:14:01.160
And they cannot see what’s wrong with them,

00:14:01.951 --> 00:14:05.160
with their own community, with their own people,

00:14:05.243 --> 00:14:07.951
who claim to be some, and such and such a thing.

00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:12.035
So this ego has really dominated so much.

00:14:13.035 --> 00:14:17.910
So far in the history, so many countries, nations, have been

00:14:17.993 --> 00:14:21.243
really tortured and butchered because of the ego of some people.

00:14:22.951 --> 00:14:27.951
Once they will realise

00:14:28.076 --> 00:14:31.160
how horrible they have been, how satanic they have been,

00:14:32.035 --> 00:14:35.076
how aggressive they have been, they’ll give it up.

00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:38.160
But they have to realise and, for that, I said,

00:14:38.951 --> 00:14:40.201
'You have to have your resurrection.’

00:14:41.035 --> 00:14:44.076
Without the resurrection, you will not know at all,

00:14:44.951 --> 00:14:48.076
you’ll not be conscious of what wrong you have been doing.

00:14:48.993 --> 00:14:53.160
It is very, very surprising how people go on doing wrong things,

00:14:53.951 --> 00:14:57.076
advertise them and come out as egos.

00:14:58.243 --> 00:15:01.910
When I read the newspapers, I say,

00:15:01.993 --> 00:15:04.035
'These are all stupid people all around.’

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:08.160
— absolutely very, very

00:15:10.076 --> 00:15:13.076
stupid in the sense that they have no understanding

00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:17.076
of what they are doing. They are just killing people,

00:15:17.201 --> 00:15:21.951
enjoying the killing and they’re so violent it is impossible

00:15:22.035 --> 00:15:26.160
to understand what sort of life they are going to have

00:15:26.951 --> 00:15:28.993
after death – even before death.

00:15:30.118 --> 00:15:33.160
In this whole thing, you see the whole picture of the world.

00:15:33.951 --> 00:15:37.993
You’ll find all such countries who are still fighting for nonsense

00:15:38.118 --> 00:15:40.076
are very, very poor,

00:15:40.951 --> 00:15:42.951
are having very bad time

00:15:43.076 --> 00:15:48.076
and they are about to be completely finished.

00:15:49.035 --> 00:15:51.035
But they don’t want to see why they are suffering,

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.160
why what’s happening, what is the problem.

00:15:54.993 --> 00:15:59.035
In the countries where there are affluence, lots of affluence,

00:15:59.993 --> 00:16:05.035
they also got lost. They too need resurrection.

00:16:06.076 --> 00:16:08.993
They have to rise above materialism

00:16:09.076 --> 00:16:12.076
and see for themselves what they’re doing is wrong.

00:16:13.993 --> 00:16:15.160
They are like, actually, cheats.

00:16:15.951 --> 00:16:18.160
They are cheating the society all the time.

00:16:18.951 --> 00:16:20.951
I think the whole economics is based

00:16:21.035 --> 00:16:24.951
on cheating, how you can cheat people. And in that cheating,

00:16:25.118 --> 00:16:27.243
you don’t even realise that you are doing something

00:16:28.035 --> 00:16:30.076
to make people so insecure.

00:16:30.951 --> 00:16:36.910
So this money business, also, is such that

00:16:37.035 --> 00:16:40.076
it makes you very greedy and you start giving too much importance to money.

00:16:44.951 --> 00:16:48.951
This is one thing to be understood from the life of Christ.

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:55.160
He was a very simple, poor man, son of a carpenter.

00:16:56.993 --> 00:17:01.951
And to Him, money was nothing but an absolutely useless thing.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.160
To Him, Spirit was everything.

00:17:04.993 --> 00:17:07.243
And He was preaching and telling people

00:17:07.951 --> 00:17:11.285
that You must have spiritual awakening. Very important.

00:17:11.951 --> 00:17:14.910
Try to understand that there is life

00:17:15.076 --> 00:17:18.118
beyond all this and then you should get

00:17:18.951 --> 00:17:24.076
the best results out of this life,

00:17:24.243 --> 00:17:26.160
which you are just wasting.’

00:17:26.993 --> 00:17:29.160
He was so intelligent and

00:17:29.285 --> 00:17:34.910
the way He discussed with all those great fathers from the Church

00:17:35.035 --> 00:17:37.076
about the religion and all that,

00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:40.368
it’s amazing how a little boy

00:17:40.452 --> 00:17:44.951
could understand so deeply about religion.

00:17:46.327 --> 00:17:49.243
He was a small boy at that time, no doubt,

00:17:50.035 --> 00:17:55.951
but He was a person from the Divine, created by the Divine.

00:17:56.327 --> 00:18:00.243
He was Shri Ganesha. He’s Aum. He’s knowledge, everything.

00:18:01.910 --> 00:18:04.243
Despite that, nobody people recognised Him

00:18:05.243 --> 00:18:07.243
because they cannot recognise the Truth.

00:18:08.076 --> 00:18:10.076
They cannot understand the Truth.

00:18:11.035 --> 00:18:14.910
They are so stupid that they can only

00:18:14.993 --> 00:18:18.118
take to something that is falsehood, that is bad.

00:18:18.285 --> 00:18:21.243
And ultimately they crucified Him.

00:18:22.201 --> 00:18:25.951
This is a funny world where saints are crucified

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.910
and the devils are given so much importance.

00:18:30.951 --> 00:18:32.850
But now the time has come

00:18:33.076 --> 00:18:37.076
for all these people who are doing wrong,

00:18:37.951 --> 00:18:41.951
who are trying to strangle others, will be strangled.

00:18:43.076 --> 00:18:47.076
They will be all exposed.I’ve told you this is the year of exposure.

00:18:47.285 --> 00:18:51.243
They’ll be all exposed if they are doing all such things

00:18:51.910 --> 00:18:54.118
of aggression and of greed.

00:18:54.285 --> 00:18:57.951
All their greed will be completely exposed

00:18:58.076 --> 00:18:59.993
and they will be thrown into hell.

00:19:00.118 --> 00:19:03.951
This is what I felt for this year especially.

00:19:04.243 --> 00:19:08.243
This has to happen, so best thing is to take to your resurrection,

00:19:08.951 --> 00:19:12.118
take to your higher life

00:19:12.243 --> 00:19:14.951
and see for yourself 'What are you doing?’

00:19:15.243 --> 00:19:17.243
What is the greatest thing to have?

00:19:18.076 --> 00:19:22.076
Money? Power? It doesn’t help anyone.

00:19:22.951 --> 00:19:25.035
People don’t have great name with that.

00:19:25.201 --> 00:19:28.160
Nobody remembers anybody who’s a drunkard.

00:19:29.076 --> 00:19:31.118
They don’t have statues of the drunkard people.

00:19:34.951 --> 00:19:37.951
So who achieves something higher?

00:19:38.285 --> 00:19:43.285
Who achieves great name like Christ?

00:19:44.201 --> 00:19:47.160
Those who have sacrificed their lives

00:19:47.951 --> 00:19:52.035
for the betterment of humanity, for helping them.

00:19:52.243 --> 00:19:54.201
Why did they do it?

00:19:55.035 --> 00:19:58.076
Because they loved human beings.

00:19:58.285 --> 00:20:00.951
They loved human being.

00:20:01.076 --> 00:20:04.951
When you love others, then you start thinking about

00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:09.201
‘what is the best, what can you do the best for them?’

00:20:09.951 --> 00:20:12.076
Now there are parents who are ignorant.

00:20:12.201 --> 00:20:15.076
They don’t know what to do for their children,

00:20:15.951 --> 00:20:21.243
so they try to dazzle the children with

00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:25.243
lots of things and food and this and that.

00:20:25.951 --> 00:20:28.951
But children, if they are not brought up with love,

00:20:29.285 --> 00:20:33.243
they’ll have no consideration whatsoever.They’ll go astray.

00:20:35.076 --> 00:20:38.243
But, in case they know somebody loves,

00:20:38.951 --> 00:20:41.368
for that love’s sake they will not go astray.

00:20:41.951 --> 00:20:43.160
They will not do wrong things.

00:20:43.285 --> 00:20:45.327
So the greatest thing about

00:20:46.035 --> 00:20:50.118
Christ or anyone of these great people is that they loved.

00:20:51.035 --> 00:20:55.035
They loved the people. They loved all human beings.

00:20:56.243 --> 00:20:58.201
That is what we have to know.

00:20:58.951 --> 00:21:02.243
Do we love ourselves, only our families,

00:21:02.993 --> 00:21:07.076
only our country? Or [do] we love the whole world?

00:21:08.076 --> 00:21:13.076
Do we live for the whole world or we live only for our limited circles.

00:21:13.951 --> 00:21:16.951
We should find out 'What are our aspirations?

00:21:17.243 --> 00:21:21.201
What are our desires? What do we want to have?’

00:21:22.035 --> 00:21:26.035
If you are really thinking of other people

00:21:27.201 --> 00:21:29.243
as your own, with love,

00:21:30.076 --> 00:21:35.076
it’s so joy giving. You may have any amount of ornaments,

00:21:35.201 --> 00:21:39.076
may have any amount of houses, any property, any money,

00:21:39.243 --> 00:21:41.076
you may have any power,

00:21:41.201 --> 00:21:43.951
you might be the prime minister of this

00:21:44.076 --> 00:21:46.035
or the prime minister of another,

00:21:46.327 --> 00:21:49.285
but if you have no love for others,

00:21:49.951 --> 00:21:51.243
you cannot enjoy yourself.

00:21:52.076 --> 00:21:55.035
Your enjoyment only comes through love,

00:21:55.243 --> 00:21:57.285
that your capacity to love.

00:21:58.076 --> 00:22:00.951
There’s no other way you can enjoy yourself.

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.285
You may have television, you may have music

00:22:04.951 --> 00:22:07.118
you may go for dinner parties, everything,

00:22:07.243 --> 00:22:10.160
but still nothing penetrates.

00:22:11.076 --> 00:22:15.076
Nothing is there to give you real joy.

00:22:15.243 --> 00:22:17.243
That’s what Christ has taught us,

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:20.910
that He had love for all the human beings

00:22:21.243 --> 00:22:25.243
and He wanted to prepare them for the Resurrection.

00:22:26.327 --> 00:22:29.285
He came before Sahaja Yoga came in.

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.243
If He had not done that job,

00:22:33.951 --> 00:22:36.951
it would have been difficult for Me to achieve it.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:40.076
So He had prepared the stage for Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:40.243 --> 00:22:42.951
That now your Agnyas are opened

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:49.160
and through the Agnya you can take the Kundalini upward

00:22:49.327 --> 00:22:54.327
through the Sahasrara and open the fontanel bone area.

00:22:55.076 --> 00:23:01.076
All this He thought of was a part and parcel of His love for people.

00:23:01.327 --> 00:23:05.035
And that’s what He did. And He cared for so many people.

00:23:05.243 --> 00:23:07.951
He’s such a help to us in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:08.118 --> 00:23:09.993
Without Him, I don’t know

00:23:08.118 --> 00:23:10.076
how could I have really broken the Agnya Chakra.

00:23:14.993 --> 00:23:17.993
Because, as you know, Agnya is such a horrible thing.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:21.410
People go on doing wrong things through Agnya

00:23:21.993 --> 00:23:24.201
and they never feel bad about it,

00:23:25.076 --> 00:23:27.160
never think they have done anything wrong,

00:23:27.368 --> 00:23:30.410
they have harmed anyone, they have tortured anybody

00:23:30.993 --> 00:23:32.327
or they have made others cry.

00:23:32.993 --> 00:23:37.243
They go on with their Agnya, but they have no heart

00:23:37.951 --> 00:23:40.201
to feel what they have been up to.

00:23:41.076 --> 00:23:44.993
It’s Christ only. He shows us that you break your Agnya,

00:23:45.368 --> 00:23:47.243
pass through your Agnya.

00:23:47.410 --> 00:23:49.410
Here they call it as a third eye.

00:23:49.951 --> 00:23:52.243
The other day one lady came with a magazine of 'Third Eye’

00:23:52.910 --> 00:23:55.118
and when I told her what it is she was surprised.

00:23:55.993 --> 00:23:58.243
If your third eye is to be opened means

00:23:58.452 --> 00:24:02.201
Christ is to be awakened within you, on your Agnya.

00:24:02.993 --> 00:24:06.076
That’s the third eye. Now what He does by —

00:24:06.993 --> 00:24:09.035
He creates a witness state within you.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:12.201
You become the witness of the whole drama.

00:24:13.035 --> 00:24:15.076
You start seeing the whole drama

00:24:15.327 --> 00:24:19.243
and you are amazed how you are silent,

00:24:19.951 --> 00:24:21.951
thoughtlessly aware

00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:25.160
and how you are seeing everything without reacting.

00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:30.118
This is where we have to believe that Christ has taken

00:24:30.285 --> 00:24:33.243
His form in our Agnya.

00:24:33.951 --> 00:24:35.076
His birth is there.

00:24:35.243 --> 00:24:37.076
His resurrection is there,

00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.243
all that we have got it already, worked it out.

00:24:41.035 --> 00:24:44.951
Like a machinery, the whole being’s made

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.160
and we have different, different chakras and centres.

00:24:48.327 --> 00:24:51.076
This is the last, most difficult centre,

00:24:51.243 --> 00:24:57.243
which was really opened out by Jesus Christ.

00:24:57.951 --> 00:25:02.035
He’s the one who dared it and who did it so beautifully

00:25:02.201 --> 00:25:06.993
that we too have now capacity to look at our ego,

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:09.993
to see for ourselves, ‡What are we doing?

00:25:10.243 --> 00:25:14.118
Why do we think we are something very exceptional?’

00:25:14.993 --> 00:25:17.993
Once you start seeing the ego, you will be amazed.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.076
Whatever work you may do, whatever you may do, you’ll never be tired

00:25:23.076 --> 00:25:25.951
We get tired because all the time ego is saying,

00:25:26.035 --> 00:25:27.993
'Oh, you are so great.

00:25:28.243 --> 00:25:31.035
You are doing so much work for others.

00:25:31.243 --> 00:25:33.951
You have achieved so much,’ all that.

00:25:34.076 --> 00:25:38.035
So then the ego goes on all the time

00:25:38.118 --> 00:25:42.118
pointing out all this false greatness about us

00:25:42.243 --> 00:25:46.035
and we get tired that 'We are so great and why should we work?

00:25:46.243 --> 00:25:47.951
Why should we help others?’

00:25:48.076 --> 00:25:52.285
Like that, funny ideas start crawling in our mind

00:25:52.951 --> 00:25:57.076
and what we do is that we feel very tired out.

00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:01.118
Fighting with those ideas, we feel very tired.

00:26:01.243 --> 00:26:04.160
Now, our whole situation

00:26:05.243 --> 00:26:09.201
is made much simpler by the life of Christ.

00:26:09.910 --> 00:26:13.951
But look at the Christian nations. They are juxtaposition.

00:26:14.285 --> 00:26:18.243
They are on the other side of Christ’s teachings.

00:26:18.951 --> 00:26:20.951
They are the most aggressive countries.

00:26:22.035 --> 00:26:25.243
They aggress people so much

00:26:26.076 --> 00:26:29.160
that in the whole world they are regarded as something

00:26:29.243 --> 00:26:33.951
very great and like they’re the kings or something.

00:26:34.076 --> 00:26:37.951
I know this because we were in slavery in India

00:26:38.243 --> 00:26:42.327
and I was surprised that these people came from outside

00:26:43.035 --> 00:26:44.951
and were nicely become master.

00:26:45.327 --> 00:26:49.201
They were masters and used to treat us so badly,

00:26:49.951 --> 00:26:53.951
used to really make slaves out of us.

00:26:54.951 --> 00:27:01.160
So the slavery started and then all such things started in India,

00:27:01.327 --> 00:27:03.243
as well as abroad.

00:27:03.951 --> 00:27:05.951
Everywhere people started thinking

00:27:06.076 --> 00:27:08.160
that they are great – and they were Christians.

00:27:08.993 --> 00:27:12.951
They used to go to church and from the church what did you learn?

00:27:13.035 --> 00:27:15.951
How to dominate others, how to show them down,

00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:20.243
how to take away all that belongs

00:27:21.035 --> 00:27:24.243
to the poorer people or to the less stronger people.

00:27:26.035 --> 00:27:28.035
It’s a thing we have seen ourselves.

00:27:28.327 --> 00:27:33.285
So this happens to people who have this ego, very, very powerful.

00:27:33.951 --> 00:27:36.285
And they try to take over

00:27:38.076 --> 00:27:40.076
things that belong to other countries.

00:27:40.201 --> 00:27:43.076
What right have they got to take somebody’s country,

00:27:43.201 --> 00:27:45.160
I can’t understand.

00:28:07.846 --> 00:28:12.888
All these complications are there.

00:28:13.721 --> 00:28:16.721
In the modern time they’re the worst.

00:28:16.888 --> 00:28:19.804
It was never so bad as it is today.

00:28:20.554 --> 00:28:25.554
We had Hitler. We had people of that kind once in a while.

00:28:25.679 --> 00:28:28.638
But the whole world was together on one side.

00:28:28.721 --> 00:28:30.721
Nobody was confused.

00:28:31.679 --> 00:28:36.554
Nobody knew that you have to fight all the time.

00:28:36.679 --> 00:28:39.846
Now, maybe because of newspapers, I don’t know why,

00:28:40.679 --> 00:28:43.638
nobody knows which side is correct, which is not correct.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:46.846
It’s being such a dispute about everything

00:28:47.596 --> 00:28:50.679
and people don’t try to understand the reality of the problem.

00:28:51.763 --> 00:28:54.930
And they are killing left and right all kinds of people.

00:28:55.638 --> 00:28:57.679
It is very surprising how,

00:28:58.679 --> 00:29:01.596
in this world, human beings are killing

00:29:01.721 --> 00:29:03.721
each other much more than the animals do.

00:29:05.554 --> 00:29:08.846
We are the worst, worse than the animals,

00:29:09.721 --> 00:29:16.679
that we are killing ourselves, our own clan, our own people.

00:29:17.554 --> 00:29:19.846
In India also we are surprised how

00:29:20.638 --> 00:29:23.554
they are killing — Kashmiris are killing Kashmiris.

00:29:26.596 --> 00:29:28.804
In the same way, everywhere you go, you find

00:29:28.846 --> 00:29:30.846
they are fighting among themselves.

00:29:31.513 --> 00:29:33.513
If you go to Africa, you will be surprised how

00:29:33.638 --> 00:29:34.846
they are fighting among themselves.

00:29:35.596 --> 00:29:39.679
I mean, now the principle of fighting has come up very strong

00:29:40.554 --> 00:29:43.804
and people think fighting is a very important part of human beings.

00:29:44.638 --> 00:29:47.679
Anything you say, immediately fighting will start.

00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:51.846
Now look at Christ and His life.

00:29:52.596 --> 00:29:55.763
He didn’t fight anyone. He didn’t argue with anyone

00:29:56.596 --> 00:30:01.679
and He accepted, accepted the death on the cross.

00:30:02.846 --> 00:30:05.638
He accepted it because He knew

00:30:05.804 --> 00:30:07.763
that it is for the resurrection,

00:30:08.554 --> 00:30:10.888
for not only His, [but] for the resurrection of the whole world.

00:30:11.846 --> 00:30:13.804
And this is what we have to learn.

00:30:13.930 --> 00:30:16.846
We have to be the models of resurrection.

00:30:17.679 --> 00:30:19.679
We see all these things happening,

00:30:19.846 --> 00:30:21.846
we’re upset also about it

00:30:22.679 --> 00:30:25.679
and when after Realisation

00:30:25.888 --> 00:30:28.846
people see that surroundings are full of this,

00:30:29.554 --> 00:30:31.846
their own people are like this, they start fighting

00:30:32.554 --> 00:30:35.763
for nothing at all and they realise

00:30:36.554 --> 00:30:39.638
that 'These are my own people who are doing this nonsense.’

00:30:39.846 --> 00:30:41.846
You can’t correct it. You can’t do anything.

00:30:42.846 --> 00:30:47.596
But if your Agnya is clear, if your ego is finished,

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:53.930
if there is no domination of any kind in your mind

00:30:54.846 --> 00:30:57.596
– and also [if] your conditioning is finished,

00:30:57.846 --> 00:31:02.554
then you become the channel of creating peace.

00:31:03.554 --> 00:31:07.554
You are the one, wherever you are, you can create peace.

00:31:07.888 --> 00:31:12.554
This is something, a special thing for Sahaja Yogis to know,

00:31:12.721 --> 00:31:16.804
that if you have no Agnya, you may look like you are suffering,

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:19.846
but you are not. You are doing it for others,

00:31:20.554 --> 00:31:24.846
for surroundings, for your friends, for your neighbours,

00:31:25.638 --> 00:31:27.846
you can say for your countrymen, for all of them.

00:31:28.763 --> 00:31:30.763
When you have no Agnya

00:31:31.554 --> 00:31:35.846
you become such a big source of Divine Force

00:31:36.554 --> 00:31:38.554
that it can work out anything.

00:31:39.721 --> 00:31:42.721
It can change, transform people.

00:31:44.679 --> 00:31:47.763
It can happen like that and

00:31:48.554 --> 00:31:50.930
it has happened to many people before, individually.

00:31:51.679 --> 00:31:55.638
But now collectively I’m sure all this anger,

00:31:55.763 --> 00:31:58.679
all this temperament of aggression

00:31:58.846 --> 00:32:00.846
and all these challenges

00:32:01.679 --> 00:32:05.596
from all these nasty people can be brought to an end.

00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:09.554
with the people who have no ego,

00:32:10.596 --> 00:32:14.638
with the people who are not justifying their wrong things,

00:32:15.679 --> 00:32:21.679
with the people who have a clear cut idea as to what is the Truth.

00:32:22.846 --> 00:32:25.763
They may speak. They may not speak. It makes no difference.

00:32:26.596 --> 00:32:29.679
Whatever they are, but they are such a big shield

00:32:30.638 --> 00:32:32.638
against those aggressive forces,

00:32:32.846 --> 00:32:34.888
which are ruining the peace of the world.

00:32:35.846 --> 00:32:37.888
So Christ did it for the peace,

00:32:38.721 --> 00:32:40.679
to bring peace on this Earth.

00:32:40.846 --> 00:32:43.846
It’s very important there should be peace,

00:32:44.554 --> 00:32:46.846
but if there is no peace within, how can you have peace outside.

00:32:47.763 --> 00:32:50.804
It’s very surprising how so many countries

00:32:50.846 --> 00:32:54.846
who talk of peace are engaged in wars and fighting.

00:32:55.554 --> 00:32:56.763
How can you have like that?

00:32:57.638 --> 00:32:59.763
They have no solution. They don’t understand.

00:33:00.554 --> 00:33:06.638
The only solution I find is to transform them in Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:06.763 --> 00:33:07.846
That’s the only one.

00:33:08.554 --> 00:33:10.554
You have to take out their ego.

00:33:10.638 --> 00:33:13.513
You can see in many people, it resists.

00:33:13.846 --> 00:33:15.804
It is there, is working.

00:33:15.930 --> 00:33:20.513
This ego is a very, very dangerous thing people have.

00:33:20.763 --> 00:33:23.721
So this one was the one

00:33:24.554 --> 00:33:29.554
which was really handled by Jesus.

00:33:29.888 --> 00:33:33.888
He tried to neutralise your ego.

00:33:36.721 --> 00:33:42.846
He tried to take out the problems of the ego

00:33:43.763 --> 00:33:46.804
to make you a humble, mild personality.

00:33:47.596 --> 00:33:50.554
To say that a humble and mild person

00:33:50.679 --> 00:33:54.679
is always into a danger is a wrong thing to say.

00:33:55.679 --> 00:34:00.679
See them. When the people are aggressive

00:34:01.596 --> 00:34:03.638
and people are trying to dominate,

00:34:04.846 --> 00:34:08.888
the humble man is the winner, not the one who dominates.

00:34:34.156 --> 00:34:41.072
So main thing is now to watch out for

00:34:41.364 --> 00:34:44.406
your Mr. Ego, how it works. It’s very interesting,

00:34:45.364 --> 00:34:48.406
very interesting to see how it makes a drama.

00:34:49.156 --> 00:34:51.197
how it tries to cover up things,

00:34:51.364 --> 00:34:55.239
how he tries to show that you are superior to others.

00:34:55.364 --> 00:34:59.364
It is to be seen. It is to be seen very clearly

00:35:00.072 --> 00:35:03.197
what this Agnya is up to.

00:35:04.406 --> 00:35:07.489
It’s a very, very mischievous thing,

00:35:08.072 --> 00:35:12.072
very harmful thing and most embarrassing also.

00:35:12.489 --> 00:35:15.156
So these egoistical people are

00:35:15.322 --> 00:35:18.364
like that and ultimately they become nervous people

00:35:19.364 --> 00:35:22.364
— very nervous and think no end of themselves.

00:35:23.072 --> 00:35:25.072
First they try to control others.

00:35:25.531 --> 00:35:30.239
But then they are needed to be controlled they are like that

00:35:30.364 --> 00:35:34.489
because they are all the time trying to control others

00:35:35.072 --> 00:35:37.281
and they don’t know how to control themselves.

00:35:40.281 --> 00:35:42.322
Who is the child crying so much?

00:35:43.448 --> 00:35:45.406
Why is he crying?

00:35:55.489 --> 00:35:57.489
Must be something wrong.

00:36:01.197 --> 00:36:04.397
Normally children keep very quiet in my lecture.

00:36:14.764 --> 00:36:17.806
Now this ego is also like this child.

00:36:18.806 --> 00:36:21.806
It doesn’t hear anything, doesn’t understand anything.

00:36:22.014 --> 00:36:25.056
It just goes on disturbing everything.

00:36:25.889 --> 00:36:27.973
In the same way, our ego also behaves,

00:36:28.639 --> 00:36:31.681
without having any collective knowledge, without having

00:36:31.847 --> 00:36:34.931
'What are you up to? What you are doing?

00:36:35.597 --> 00:36:39.098
Who, are you harming?’ Nothing, just a satisfaction,

00:36:39.681 --> 00:36:42.931
such a blind satisfaction that you are doing something

00:36:43.597 --> 00:36:44.889
to assert your personality.

00:36:45.847 --> 00:36:48.681
You see, if you just watch your ego, you’ll laugh

00:36:48.931 --> 00:36:51.931
and enjoy the buffoon, you’ll see what a thing it is.

00:36:52.098 --> 00:36:54.014
‘It has been befooling me so much,

00:36:54.597 --> 00:36:58.056
what a horrible thing this ego was.’

00:36:58.806 --> 00:37:00.806
At the time when Christ was there,

00:37:01.014 --> 00:37:03.056
the people have such a lot of ego.

00:37:03.597 --> 00:37:06.556
Nobody talked about it. Nobody said anything.

00:37:07.806 --> 00:37:10.639
So this was the best way that He could show us

00:37:11.014 --> 00:37:15.098
that you can break your Agnya by sacrificing your life

00:37:15.722 --> 00:37:17.722
— not in Sahaja Yoga, not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:18.597 --> 00:37:20.597
But in a way, in Sahaja Yoga also,

00:37:21.139 --> 00:37:24.931
if you have an ego you should first of all have witness state.

00:37:25.597 --> 00:37:28.098
It’s the other way round. If you have ego,

00:37:28.265 --> 00:37:31.889
you cannot have witness state. If you cannot have witness state,

00:37:32.098 --> 00:37:36.973
you cannot improve your ego. It’s a very confusing thing.

00:37:37.556 --> 00:37:41.597
Now supposing you develop a very big ego,

00:37:43.056 --> 00:37:45.098
then you go on justifying it all the time.

00:37:46.098 --> 00:37:48.223
You think, ‘Whatever I have done is good. After all,

00:37:48.764 --> 00:37:51.847
it’s very good for everyone, good for me.’

00:37:52.181 --> 00:37:54.098
Self certification starts.

00:37:54.722 --> 00:37:56.806
With that, you can never see

00:37:57.014 --> 00:37:59.014
what you are doing to yourself,

00:37:59.681 --> 00:38:00.973
what you are doing to others.

00:38:01.639 --> 00:38:04.764
It’s something, such a blind-folded nonsense.

00:38:05.722 --> 00:38:08.973
When this ego comes up in that way,

00:38:09.722 --> 00:38:14.223
then, I mean, we can have Hitlers, we can have all kinds of things.

00:38:14.764 --> 00:38:18.973
Any small point they take and form a group of people

00:38:19.223 --> 00:38:22.056
doing this kind of thing – anything.

00:38:22.265 --> 00:38:26.056
They will say that ‘Now, we are people who are spiritual.

00:38:26.681 --> 00:38:29.556
So we have a group and we are spiritual people

00:38:29.806 --> 00:38:32.014
and whatever we do is the right.’

00:38:32.806 --> 00:38:37.764
But who says it is right? By what law is it right?

00:38:38.014 --> 00:38:41.639
And we have had so many cults and this like that,

00:38:41.806 --> 00:38:44.973
everywhere, where people joined them, kill themselves,

00:38:45.181 --> 00:38:49.139
had all kinds of problems. How can that be spirituality?

00:38:49.847 --> 00:38:53.806
In spirituality the first and foremost thing is

00:38:54.056 --> 00:38:58.847
that the person becomes very meek, very humble,

00:39:00.597 --> 00:39:05.597
very humble. His heart — humility is the power.

00:39:06.722 --> 00:39:09.056
His humility is the one that works

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:13.181
and his humility is the one that glorifies.

00:39:14.014 --> 00:39:15.973
It is not the aggression.

00:39:16.764 --> 00:39:20.764
See, Hitler came and died. Who worships him?

00:39:21.639 --> 00:39:25.639
Others also came. Like Mussolini came, died. Who worships?

00:39:26.265 --> 00:39:29.223
There are so many like that who came and went away.

00:39:29.681 --> 00:39:34.722
They don’t even want to have their statues, so bad as they were.

00:39:35.181 --> 00:39:40.014
So those who have this ego are really very stupid people

00:39:40.223 --> 00:39:42.931
in the sense that they do all wrong,

00:39:43.098 --> 00:39:45.014
thinking it is the right thing to do.

00:39:45.223 --> 00:39:49.223
Ultimately, they are recognised as absolutely

00:39:50.181 --> 00:39:53.098
very, very wrong type of people.

00:39:54.722 --> 00:39:56.847
People don’t want to take their names even.

00:39:57.889 --> 00:40:01.973
So the time can prove what are they and what they’re doing.

00:40:03.056 --> 00:40:08.847
It’s a very, very calculated work of the Divine.

00:40:10.639 --> 00:40:13.098
You shouldn’t play into the hands of your ego.

00:40:13.764 --> 00:40:16.931
Try to see yourself. ‘Oh, Mr Ego, so you are there.’

00:40:17.681 --> 00:40:22.681
Try to watch. And that time, if you take the name of Jesus,

00:40:23.056 --> 00:40:26.556
ego will go away. Just say

00:40:28.139 --> 00:40:33.889
the mantra of Jesus and ego will disappear.

00:40:36.847 --> 00:40:43.931
Another side of this horrible ego is the conditioning.

00:40:44.847 --> 00:40:48.847
That also has a very, very, very subtle ego.

00:40:49.556 --> 00:40:54.556
For example, supposing if somebody comes to your house

00:40:55.639 --> 00:41:00.098
and starts saying that ‘Ah, what a dirty carpet.

00:41:00.681 --> 00:41:03.722
I don’t like this colour. That thing I don’t like’

00:41:04.139 --> 00:41:07.139
without understanding that you are hurting another person.

00:41:08.056 --> 00:41:10.098
Talking like that, he comes inside.

00:41:11.098 --> 00:41:15.764
And then, you see how stupid he has been

00:41:16.098 --> 00:41:19.764
because nobody likes such a person who is talking like that.

00:41:20.056 --> 00:41:22.806
But to him, it is very important

00:41:23.014 --> 00:41:27.056
that he should correct because he has a conditioning

00:41:27.847 --> 00:41:30.681
that a particular type of carpet is good,

00:41:30.931 --> 00:41:34.764
the another is not. That conditioning works.

00:41:34.931 --> 00:41:36.931
And he goes on talking nonsense

00:41:37.098 --> 00:41:39.139
that ‘This is not good, that is not good.’

00:41:50.935 --> 00:41:52.352
You cannot enjoy anything.

00:41:53.394 --> 00:41:55.311
You cannot enjoy anything.

00:41:55.894 --> 00:41:59.935
You go to any home, you don’t like it because there’s conditioning.

00:42:00.102 --> 00:42:02.060
You know of something else which is good.

00:42:02.561 --> 00:42:04.977
No – so they can’t enjoy.

00:42:05.352 --> 00:42:09.311
Everything they decide on their conditioning.

00:42:09.519 --> 00:42:11.477
[There] Is nothing independent.

00:42:12.227 --> 00:42:16.144
It has nothing to do with the intrinsic personality.

00:42:16.436 --> 00:42:19.352
Intrinsic value of that thing.

00:42:20.227 --> 00:42:24.269
Just like that, 'Oh, I don’t like it.’ It’s not good.

00:42:24.603 --> 00:42:27.561
It should not be said by Sahaja Yogis.

00:42:28.019 --> 00:42:30.019
Never use this word.

00:42:30.311 --> 00:42:33.311
You can find out from Me. I never do that.

00:42:34.394 --> 00:42:37.185
Whatever it is I say, it’s all right.

00:42:37.394 --> 00:42:39.352
I never criticize it.

00:42:40.019 --> 00:42:43.519
This criticism business comes from this conditioning

00:42:44.102 --> 00:42:46.019
because you have had such conditioning.

00:42:46.185 --> 00:42:49.227
Supposing you are an Englishman you have English conditioning.

00:42:50.019 --> 00:42:54.477
Now, correction comes.

00:42:55.269 --> 00:42:59.227
Their cows got this disease.

00:42:59.977 --> 00:43:03.519
How did they get the disease when you are such perfect people?

00:43:05.311 --> 00:43:09.269
Then in Europe the animals got one disease.

00:43:09.477 --> 00:43:11.144
How is it they got

00:43:11.352 --> 00:43:15.311
this disease when you think you are the cleanest people living ever?

00:43:16.894 --> 00:43:18.311
Just watch out why?

00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:21.185
It’s all their own conditioning

00:43:21.935 --> 00:43:25.561
that ‘We know everything. We are the best in the whole world

00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:29.935
and we have a right to rule everyone.’ Now have it.

00:43:30.436 --> 00:43:34.519
Now those who were very rich people, like America and all that,

00:43:35.436 --> 00:43:37.977
used to think no end of themselves.

00:43:38.269 --> 00:43:40.019
Now what has happened?

00:43:40.561 --> 00:43:45.519
Suddenly it has become a country where everybody has to pity.

00:43:46.144 --> 00:43:49.102
Why? What is the reason? Why suddenly it has happened?

00:43:49.519 --> 00:43:53.060
It’s always the nature which corrects you

00:43:53.477 --> 00:43:55.519
by giving the other side of it.

00:43:56.935 --> 00:43:59.144
Anything you try to boast of

00:43:59.436 --> 00:44:02.436
or you try to put your conditioning of others, it repels,

00:44:03.144 --> 00:44:04.352
it comes up on you.

00:44:05.603 --> 00:44:09.477
It works in such a great manner that you can’t imagine.

00:44:10.436 --> 00:44:14.019
And then it does not work out,

00:44:14.227 --> 00:44:19.144
then there are earthquakes. All kinds of calamities come in.

00:44:20.477 --> 00:44:24.060
There were a group of people who were white-skinned

00:44:25.185 --> 00:44:30.394
near the River Mississippi. And they were called as rednecks

00:44:30.935 --> 00:44:33.935
because it was always hot, their necks were always hot,

00:44:34.185 --> 00:44:37.060
they were such angry, hot-tempered people.

00:44:37.894 --> 00:44:41.894
And these rednecks were known to be very cruel.

00:44:42.185 --> 00:44:46.019
They used to kill people and put the blame on some other

00:44:46.227 --> 00:44:51.227
people from aboriginal people and arrest them and destroy them.

00:44:52.269 --> 00:44:54.352
It went on and on and on.

00:44:55.019 --> 00:44:58.019
But one day this Mississippi got flooded,

00:44:58.603 --> 00:45:04.060
so much flooded it entered all the houses of these rednecks, you see

00:45:04.561 --> 00:45:06.477
and I saw them running away

00:45:06.977 --> 00:45:09.977
with all their belongings which they could not carry also.

00:45:10.227 --> 00:45:13.227
Some of they were leaving behind, some they were running

00:45:13.436 --> 00:45:15.519
and, while running also, they were losing it.

00:45:15.977 --> 00:45:18.977
Like that, the whole chaos took place of these rednecks.

00:45:19.311 --> 00:45:22.019
And now, I am told, they are much better.

00:45:22.561 --> 00:45:27.144
All that nonsense they had of killing all the black people and

00:45:27.352 --> 00:45:29.935
torturing them, now has come on their heads.

00:45:30.144 --> 00:45:32.394
Mississippi has taught them a lesson.

00:45:33.019 --> 00:45:37.019
So how the nature also doesn’t like conditioned people

00:45:37.935 --> 00:45:42.561
— conditioning is creating a big problem now, even now,

00:45:43.019 --> 00:45:45.060
in all the countries, like racialism.

00:45:46.519 --> 00:45:49.477
Racialism is a very bad conditioning.

00:45:50.311 --> 00:45:54.019
I mean, if somebody’s black or white or red, what does it matter?

00:45:54.561 --> 00:45:56.519
God has made that person.

00:45:57.352 --> 00:45:59.352
I always say that in America,

00:45:59.935 --> 00:46:02.561
if they remove all the people who are not white-skinned,

00:46:03.060 --> 00:46:04.519
what will be left there?

00:46:05.352 --> 00:46:08.352
They don’t know how to sing,. They don’t know how to play.

00:46:09.019 --> 00:46:11.394
They don’t know how to operate.

00:46:11.977 --> 00:46:15.060
All the Indian doctors and Indian nurses will come away

00:46:15.269 --> 00:46:17.227
and what will they do?

00:46:18.019 --> 00:46:21.561
Imagine, thinking no end of themselves, they are great racists.

00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:25.185
Even now, they are, but gradually they’ll definitely improve

00:46:25.394 --> 00:46:27.352
because they should know their deficiencies.

00:46:27.894 --> 00:46:31.935
This world is one and you need people from every country

00:46:32.144 --> 00:46:34.894
to help each other. But this conditioning of

00:46:35.144 --> 00:46:37.227
thinking themselves to be something great

00:46:37.519 --> 00:46:41.477
the very bad conditioning. It is the mixture of ego

00:46:41.935 --> 00:46:45.477
with conditioning, conditioning giving the ego

00:46:46.352 --> 00:46:48.311
that ‘we are the best.’

00:46:48.603 --> 00:46:52.519
But I am very happy to know that after Realisation,

00:46:53.269 --> 00:46:57.227
it so happens, with this resurrection,

00:46:57.519 --> 00:47:02.519
Sahaja Yogis start thinking, understanding

00:47:03.185 --> 00:47:06.185
what is wrong in their own community,

00:47:07.311 --> 00:47:11.352
what is the mistake they have been committing.

00:47:11.935 --> 00:47:14.977
They just become like that — alert.

00:47:15.185 --> 00:47:16.977
And they start telling

00:47:17.102 --> 00:47:20.102
they are the ones who are doing this kind of nonsense.

00:47:20.227 --> 00:47:22.352
Imagine. It is very surprising

00:47:23.019 --> 00:47:27.019
how you become conscious of the defects of your own country.

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:29.269
It is so important, is Agnya.

00:47:29.436 --> 00:47:32.477
That’s what I think Christ had realised,

00:47:32.935 --> 00:47:35.935
that Agnya should break. Unless and until Agnya breaks,

00:47:36.102 --> 00:47:40.519
people cannot go further. And that’s why He crucified Himself

00:47:40.935 --> 00:47:44.519
and then resurrected because without killing the Agnya,

00:47:44.977 --> 00:47:46.394
you cannot resurrect.

00:47:47.269 --> 00:47:51.144
All these things have worked out so well now

00:47:51.561 --> 00:47:56.311
that the whole world is seeing you like a panoramic view,

00:47:57.019 --> 00:48:01.060
of complete destruction of the nonsense.

00:48:02.519 --> 00:48:04.519
They are seeing this very clearly

00:48:04.935 --> 00:48:07.977
and you see now these people who would not even look at us,

00:48:09.102 --> 00:48:14.477
who had a very stiff nose and stiff lips and stiff neck

00:48:15.185 --> 00:48:19.935
— all is relaxed. They are wondering why this is happening.

00:48:20.477 --> 00:48:22.477
‘From when did we get this curse?’

00:48:23.311 --> 00:48:25.311
So for the Europeans specially,

00:48:26.185 --> 00:48:29.269
they have to understand the beauty

00:48:29.894 --> 00:48:33.311
and the love and the greatness of other human beings

00:48:34.144 --> 00:48:38.102
and then that will so much satisfy them.

00:48:38.935 --> 00:48:43.603
Why there is so much problem now of this recession, how it has come.

00:48:44.352 --> 00:48:48.060
Recession is nothing. It is the same Mr. Ego.

00:48:48.477 --> 00:48:54.477
It is the same conditioning, which was like a snake was eating up.

00:48:55.185 --> 00:48:57.227
Now it has receded. It is full.

00:48:58.185 --> 00:49:00.227
It doesn’t need any more. It’s quite full.

00:49:00.561 --> 00:49:06.352
And maybe it is now in danger of getting indigestion, I think.

00:49:07.019 --> 00:49:11.185
So that these two snakes that were eating human beings are receding.

00:49:12.561 --> 00:49:15.977
It’s the best time where you can see the drama.

00:49:16.519 --> 00:49:20.477
Drama of ego and your conditioning.

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:24.436
How these two things have eaten up human beings.

00:49:25.144 --> 00:49:27.144
One should feel shy.

00:49:27.477 --> 00:49:31.436
One should feel a little bit modest about it.

00:49:32.269 --> 00:49:36.352
When you are full of ego, you don’t even see anything.

00:49:37.227 --> 00:49:42.311
Or putting a conditioning on others, it’s horrible, I tell you.

00:49:42.935 --> 00:49:46.269
I can’t understand how can they put a conditioning on others.

00:49:48.311 --> 00:49:53.311
It is now, you people all enjoy, say, for Indian music.

00:49:54.102 --> 00:49:55.935
But when the British were ruling us,

00:49:56.144 --> 00:49:59.144
they used to think it's a horrible noise going on.

00:50:00.519 --> 00:50:02.477
They could never understand.

00:50:02.977 --> 00:50:06.977
Now they are paying such a lot to attend the program for music.

00:50:07.603 --> 00:50:10.603
That is also a kind of a rebuff, but

00:50:11.144 --> 00:50:14.311
also they don’t understand. Still they will go

00:50:14.894 --> 00:50:18.935
because it’s regarded as a very big fashion

00:50:19.561 --> 00:50:21.352
to listen to Indian music.

00:50:21.935 --> 00:50:26.144
So it is your ego also is so stupid

00:50:26.352 --> 00:50:28.394
that God knows when it will give in.

00:50:29.019 --> 00:50:31.352
Today it will say, ‘This is the best thing.’

00:50:31.519 --> 00:50:33.311
Tomorrow it will say, 'No, no, no, no.

00:50:33.436 --> 00:50:35.519
We should take the other one. That’s much better.’

00:50:36.185 --> 00:50:39.185
Indecisive, they have no discrimination.

00:50:39.477 --> 00:50:42.477
Basically, people have no discrimination.

00:50:43.185 --> 00:50:46.144
Those who have ego are indiscriminate.

00:50:46.603 --> 00:50:50.477
They cannot discriminate between evil and good.

00:50:50.935 --> 00:50:53.894
And such people have been now,

00:50:54.352 --> 00:50:57.311
thank God, have been punished quite a lot.

00:50:57.519 --> 00:51:01.436
But it is the life of Christ, His model,

00:51:01.977 --> 00:51:08.352
proves that your resurrection is so essential,

00:51:08.603 --> 00:51:14.394
which is so innate, that unless and until you get it, you are lost.

00:51:15.144 --> 00:51:18.394
Whether it’s a country, whether it’s a person

00:51:18.894 --> 00:51:22.603
or any organisation. This ego that you have

00:51:23.102 --> 00:51:25.977
can ruin, ultimately, is now been proved,

00:51:27.060 --> 00:51:30.144
can completely take you away from reality.

00:51:31.102 --> 00:51:33.144
That is the thing that blinds you,

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:36.311
which can — another ego can blind you also.

00:51:37.019 --> 00:51:39.519
Like we have those priests, we have those mullahs

00:51:39.935 --> 00:51:43.269
and all these people. They are the ones who have this

00:51:45.019 --> 00:51:49.019
tremendous power to misguide

00:51:49.519 --> 00:51:53.519
you because your ego has no discretion sense.

00:51:54.102 --> 00:51:56.144
It doesn’t even think like that.

00:51:57.102 --> 00:51:59.144
And when they are specially,

00:51:59.394 --> 00:52:02.394
not so much on the ego side, but on the conditioning side,

00:52:02.935 --> 00:52:05.519
it’s even much worse – much worse.

00:52:06.436 --> 00:52:09.144
Because when you are conditioned,

00:52:09.352 --> 00:52:12.102
you start believing into all kinds of nonsense.

00:52:12.436 --> 00:52:15.060
And you start ruining your health with that.

00:52:15.394 --> 00:52:20.519
It is a very, very surprising thing how people understand

00:52:21.144 --> 00:52:24.185
and like things which are very destructive.

00:52:25.603 --> 00:52:27.185
But you can manage.

00:52:27.352 --> 00:52:30.394
These are the modern times, where you can advertise,

00:52:30.935 --> 00:52:33.561
you can do all kinds of enticement, everything

00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.060
and you can manage this Mr. Ego very well,

00:52:37.477 --> 00:52:40.519
which pampers you. In this pampering,

00:52:40.977 --> 00:52:44.977
ego gets completely drowned and

00:52:45.227 --> 00:52:48.269
it loses its control over its own personality.

00:52:49.019 --> 00:52:51.185
Thus, many by people get lost into it.

00:52:52.352 --> 00:52:54.603
Now Christ has sacrificed His life

00:52:55.269 --> 00:52:57.185
and then He resurrected.

00:52:57.561 --> 00:52:59.603
In the same way, all such people

00:53:00.060 --> 00:53:03.060
who have ruined their lives have to come up

00:53:04.144 --> 00:53:08.019
through resurrection. there’s no other way out through Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:08.394 --> 00:53:13.185
When you understand your own value, you’ll understand everything.

00:53:14.227 --> 00:53:16.977
Otherwise, what is it? You are looking through your eyes

00:53:17.144 --> 00:53:19.019
or somebody else’s eyes?

00:53:19.227 --> 00:53:22.227
You are hearing through your ears or somebody else’s ear?

00:53:23.477 --> 00:53:27.102
It should be your own, so know thyself.

00:53:28.102 --> 00:53:31.561
When you know thyself, everything will work out very well.

00:53:32.519 --> 00:53:37.227
Out of this only, out of this category of people who know themselves

00:53:37.436 --> 00:53:39.477
Sahaja Yoga can be built up —

00:53:39.935 --> 00:53:42.477
not by people who do not know themselves.

00:53:43.935 --> 00:53:48.977
It’s a very, very long subject. I could go on on these two subjects,

00:53:49.185 --> 00:53:52.227
but the main thing is we have to be thankful

00:53:52.519 --> 00:53:57.977
to Christ for bringing this resurrection

00:53:58.227 --> 00:54:01.352
into play so that we get our discretion.

00:54:02.227 --> 00:54:04.227
Divine discretion, we’ll get it.

00:54:04.436 --> 00:54:09.477
It’s such a struggle, such a path He created,

00:54:09.977 --> 00:54:15.436
that we could go through this ordeal very easily,

00:54:16.352 --> 00:54:20.311
which will kill our ego and our conditionings.

00:54:22.102 --> 00:54:24.935
I am happy Sahaja Yogis will realise it

00:54:25.311 --> 00:54:28.019
and respect it within yourself,

00:54:28.227 --> 00:54:32.185
that you are seeing your ego and superego

00:54:32.477 --> 00:54:35.477
so clearly and that you could be above it.

00:54:37.019 --> 00:54:39.060
May God bless you all.
