WEBVTT

00:06.568 --> 00:11.691
It’s so gratifying and joyous to see all
of you here,

00:11.892 --> 00:19.915
today, assembled to do Shri Krishna Puja.

00:20.115 --> 00:23.831
Can you hear Me there?

00:24.808 --> 00:30.410
No? Can’t hear.

00:31.882 --> 00:36.549
Gregoire: Phil, can you connect back…

01:08.673 --> 01:11.948
Shri Mataji: To see so many Sahaja Yogis
assembled here,

01:12.148 --> 01:17.235
I’m sure the devil must have run away
long time back.

01:20.422 --> 01:28.007
And the caravan must have left

01:28.207 --> 01:35.053
but I hope we are aware of it

01:35.253 --> 01:41.855
and we forget about our fears of our
catches, of our past,

01:42.055 --> 01:46.671
of all the nonsense we have done so far.

01:47.089 --> 01:57.083
Suddenly in My presence, I think, people
get into a sense of guilt.

01:58.997 --> 02:02.248
I’m here to soothe you, to cleanse you,

02:02.449 --> 02:09.424
to make you beautiful and not to feel
guilty.

02:13.739 --> 02:24.717
Actually, when we start looking
at ourselves,

02:24.918 --> 02:30.663
the first thing we notice is that there’s
a block on the Agnya,

02:31.712 --> 02:37.196
but this block in the Agnya is the worst
thing that can happen to us

02:37.445 --> 02:41.694
because it is the door of the Kundalini.

02:41.894 --> 02:44.991
She reaches up to Vishuddhi, all right,

02:45.191 --> 02:49.209
and when She has to move forward,
this Agnya stops it.

02:49.384 --> 02:55.095
That’s why we have left Vishuddhi, we have
all the Vishuddhi problems.

02:55.296 --> 02:59.413
The flow cannot take place.

03:04.183 --> 03:08.050
Also, this is one of the reasons we feel
guilty - because of left Vishuddhi.

03:08.251 --> 03:11.906
It’s a symptom of a disease.

03:12.107 --> 03:16.655
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

03:16.856 --> 03:20.863
So we have to understand, first of all,
that we are Sahaja Yogis.

03:21.093 --> 03:24.426
We are not ordinary people

03:24.626 --> 03:27.158
or we are not people who have not known
the truth;

03:27.359 --> 03:32.147
we have known the truth. We have to be
completely aware of it.

03:32.325 --> 03:39.450
That’s one truth if you establish, you have
established yourself quite a lot.

03:39.650 --> 03:44.090
Now the ordinary people as you have seen
on Oxford St., you see,

03:44.290 --> 03:50.080
they wear dress - Indian dresses funnily
tied;

03:50.280 --> 03:56.809
they don’t know how to tie it up, dhotis
and saris, and they shake their heads

03:57.009 --> 04:03.006
and buy some of these, what we call them,

04:03.207 --> 04:08.386
shindis or bodhis or I don’t know what you
call, tails, pigtails,

04:08.587 --> 04:17.564
and attach them with some glue and they
start dancing.

04:17.765 --> 04:24.628
When they dance, their pigtail falls off,

04:24.829 --> 04:33.877
and the saris and the dhotis, everything
start opening out.

04:34.100 --> 04:36.783
That’s a very funny, ridiculous scene,
I tell you.

04:36.984 --> 04:40.815
One side you see the punks and another
side you see this nonsense,

04:41.021 --> 04:42.993
in the name of Shri Krishna, that’s even
worse.

04:43.194 --> 04:45.229
Punks do not do it in the name of,

04:45.456 --> 04:49.943
I don’t know if they do it in the name
of King Solomon.

04:50.387 --> 04:56.529
But they do it in somebody’s name, these
people that is so great as Shri Krishna.

04:57.500 --> 05:05.597
On the contrary, Shri Krishna’s hair are
described in all the books

05:13.476 --> 05:23.017
and in all the poetry that poets could
sing about.

05:23.218 --> 05:26.734
He was never shaven-headed. It is
impossible

05:26.934 --> 05:31.885
to understand how these people got the idea
that you must shave your head.

05:32.425 --> 05:38.865
So the Shri Krishna’s aspect of Yogeshwara
has been so misunderstood.

05:39.822 --> 05:44.844
It’s absolutely misunderstood because
we cannot understand

05:45.045 --> 05:51.277
that the truth is covered with maya,
always.

05:52.091 --> 05:55.498
And you should keep maya on one side
and go to the truth.

05:55.699 --> 06:00.554
Instead of that, we get lost in the maya,
like very simple example, as it is,

06:00.754 --> 06:03.960
that He is a Yogeshwara; so these people
have idea of a yogi,

06:04.161 --> 06:07.845
that he should be shaven, he should wear
that dhoti, dirty one,

06:08.046 --> 06:14.857
and must put on a pigtail. Another concept,
maya is a concept.

06:15.038 --> 06:18.230
And when you start living on those concepts
of your own,

06:18.431 --> 06:21.763
you may gather it up with something else,
you may think that Christ

06:21.964 --> 06:27.085
was a person who was a sannyasi, who used
to wear another kind of a robe

06:27.285 --> 06:30.798
and He had a beard and He had hair like
this. All those ideas,

06:30.998 --> 06:36.812
“So if we become like this, we’ll be very
great yogis.”

06:38.099 --> 06:41.824
These are all our concepts about someone

06:41.995 --> 06:46.068
whom we have never seen, whom we have
never known.

06:46.268 --> 06:51.750
And because we live in those concepts,
we get limited.

06:56.482 --> 06:59.703
It’s very difficult for these people
to break through

06:59.922 --> 07:04.214
because maya can only be broken through
Rrealization.

07:04.415 --> 07:06.796
That’s why first thing in Sahaja Yoga
is Realization.

07:06.997 --> 07:07.774
Get your Realization.

07:07.975 --> 07:10.076
You are a drunkard, all right, get your
Realization.

07:10.277 --> 07:11.895
You are a drug addict, get your
Realization.

07:12.096 --> 07:14.993
You are a bad man, get your Realization.

07:15.193 --> 07:20.089
Anyone, get your Realization first;
put the light first into a person.

07:20.289 --> 07:23.294
Let him see for himself.

07:24.435 --> 07:29.046
So all this identification with different
concepts

07:29.226 --> 07:38.590
is responsible for giving us a very mayavi
or illusive personality.

07:39.665 --> 07:42.294
We live in an illusive personality, live
with it,

07:42.495 --> 07:48.927
enjoy it and we think we are perfectly
all right.

07:52.496 --> 07:57.015
Now if you are aware you are Sahaja Yogis

07:57.945 --> 08:02.235
and you have come here for Shri Krishna
Puja,

08:02.436 --> 08:05.415
what is the preparation we have to do?

08:05.616 --> 08:10.082
We’re Sahaja Yogis, we know about
Kundalini,

08:10.283 --> 08:16.102
we know about Vishuddhis, we know about
Shri Krishna.

08:16.303 --> 08:24.082
All right, how are we going to prepare
ourselves for the puja of Shri Krishna?

08:28.144 --> 08:33.459
First of all, He tried to break all
the concepts.

08:33.660 --> 08:48.837
First the concept He broke was that you
have to be like a ascetic to look at.

08:49.038 --> 08:54.233
He broke this concept; He lived like
a king.

08:56.658 --> 09:04.178
In His childhood He used to go and play
with the cows.

09:05.632 --> 09:16.158
And there He would use a peacock’s feather
to decorate Himself,

09:19.764 --> 09:30.945
and He would listen to beautiful music
of the river Yamuna and reproduce it.

09:32.347 --> 09:39.410
He was Leeladhara, He was the one who
created all kinds of mirth.

09:39.610 --> 09:44.464
What is mirth in French?

09:44.622 --> 09:47.536
They don’t have mirth, I believe.
Gregoire: I don’t understand, Shri Mataji…

09:47.736 --> 09:49.875
Yogis: Mirth.

09:50.075 --> 09:53.534
Gregoire: Mirth… they don’t.

09:53.734 --> 09:56.929
Shri Mataji: Eh? No?

09:57.130 --> 10:00.812
Yogi: Fun.
Gregoire: No, it’s not fun… Sweetness.

10:01.013 --> 10:03.730
Shri Mataji: It’s not fun, it’s more than…,
it’s mirth.

10:03.930 --> 10:08.538
Mirth is sweeter than fun.
Gregoire: Sweet fun…

10:08.739 --> 10:15.026
Shri Mataji: All right, sweet fun.
What a word!

10:20.326 --> 10:23.405
Sweet fun!

10:25.301 --> 10:28.612
This is mirth, now what is happening
to you is mirth.

10:28.812 --> 10:36.351
I’m creating mirth in which you feel
tickled, you know.

10:36.551 --> 10:41.476
Mirth is something where you feel tickled.

10:42.588 --> 10:51.003
So, He tried to create mirth, never
seriousness

10:51.906 --> 10:57.099
but He was not frivolous. He was Yogeshwara
Himself. He was not frivolous.

10:57.281 --> 11:04.658
So this difference between frivolity
and mirth

11:06.852 --> 11:12.285
is to be understood only through Him
because He’s also discretion.

11:18.780 --> 11:26.253
Mirth is joy-giving, frivolity is
destructive. Anything frivolous if you do…

11:26.453 --> 11:30.995
[Please close it, isn’t it? There’s
something problematic.]

11:38.109 --> 11:48.558
So, we have to be in a state of mirth,

11:50.939 --> 11:57.876
so no question of feeling guilty comes in,
we are not prisoners, are we?

11:58.076 --> 12:02.103
We are prisoners of our own concepts
and our own ideas

12:02.304 --> 12:05.578
and our own degradation.

12:06.984 --> 12:11.086
We degrade ourselves, God does not.

12:11.875 --> 12:19.657
So we should be in the state of complete
mirth and enjoyment.

12:24.109 --> 12:28.183
Now it has rained, all right.

12:28.501 --> 12:32.743
That’s a very good thing to happen today.

12:32.974 --> 12:36.890
Yesterday I was listening to the program,
I was just smiling,

12:37.090 --> 12:41.465
because I knew it would not work out
that way.

12:41.665 --> 12:45.317
Gregoire: Everybody knew, Shri Mataji…

12:47.592 --> 12:55.680
Shri Mataji: And in India, on this day,
when they celebrate, in the morning,

12:55.880 --> 13:06.901
children of the village or children
of the particular areas gather together.

13:08.259 --> 13:19.346
And for them the house-holders tie up
a little pitcher, which we call as a matka,

13:19.547 --> 13:24.537
and in that there is money, anything
valuable they want to give to the children,

13:24.738 --> 13:31.352
sweets, everything put inside that, and
is tied up in the air.

13:31.552 --> 13:35.017
Normally it rains, if it doesn’t rain

13:35.218 --> 13:39.149
then they pour water on the children
to make them feel it’s raining.

13:39.350 --> 13:43.656
Rain is very much connected with
Shri Krishna.

13:46.959 --> 13:52.718
So the children come and they go in a way
that

13:52.919 --> 13:59.058
the taller boys are first, then smaller,
then smaller like a pyramid they go up

13:59.259 --> 14:04.604
till at the end there’s one boy who’s sort
of representing Shri Krishna

14:04.810 --> 14:10.491
and then he breaks that. And from there
everything falls down

14:10.692 --> 14:14.147
and flowers, everything on them, they take
the money,

14:14.348 --> 14:20.262
they take all those things and start
enjoying.

14:20.463 --> 14:26.327
Then they go to another place, the whole
day they are moving in the city like that

14:26.527 --> 14:35.054
and every good householder ties that matka

14:35.254 --> 14:41.254
for these children, for them to come
and enjoy themselves.

14:41.416 --> 14:50.541
That’s in the real sense, is the Krishna
Ashtami in Gokul where He lived as a child.

14:50.741 --> 14:57.691
Now why is He so much connected with rain?

14:59.393 --> 15:10.045
Once all His friends and He were looking
after the cows

15:11.596 --> 15:20.171
and Indra felt that He is very powerful,
somehow, I don’t know,

15:20.372 --> 15:24.592
He gets into jealousies sometimes.

15:27.549 --> 15:36.165
And He sent rain to test His patience,

15:36.365 --> 15:41.626
His leela, His play, His mirth.

15:44.718 --> 15:54.413
And it rained and rained and rained and
they did not know what to do.

15:55.151 --> 16:00.554
So there was a mountain called Govardhan.

16:00.754 --> 16:06.984
Shri Krishna lifted it with His stick
or His finger

16:07.184 --> 16:12.056
and just put it up on top of His finger,
like that.

16:12.233 --> 16:15.916
That’s why He is called as Govardhan Dhari.

16:16.117 --> 16:20.525
And the whole mountain was on top

16:21.384 --> 16:26.771
and all the children joined Him and
all the cows

16:26.972 --> 16:34.501
and He asked the children, “You also put
your sticks up to help Me.”

16:36.467 --> 16:43.444
And they all put their sticks and standing
very sweetly holding the Govardhan.

16:43.644 --> 16:50.469
That is one of His names, Govardhan Dhari.

16:54.451 --> 17:00.924
So the rain had to come and the cows
with their bells have to remind us.

17:01.124 --> 17:05.089
And imagine the lake has a name which
is a black;

17:05.290 --> 17:11.642
Krishna means black, Krishna word itself
means black.

17:12.579 --> 17:16.745
How Sahaj the whole thing has worked out!

17:17.506 --> 17:23.983
Can you see the coincidences are so Sahaj
but are so planned?

17:26.332 --> 17:32.233
And here we are sitting, it’s raining,
nicely enjoying everything.

17:36.125 --> 17:46.590
But on the contrary, when we start not
enjoying,

17:47.736 --> 17:54.211
we play into, either into our ego
or superego.

17:56.015 --> 18:03.225
Supposing we are starved people, tortured
people,

18:05.240 --> 18:11.192
then we start making others like ourselves.

18:12.740 --> 18:19.002
We like to make them suffer and torture
them.

18:20.563 --> 18:23.346
That’s why I always say, “Poverty is
leprosy.”

18:23.546 --> 18:29.226
Anybody who is in poverty can develop
horrible things within themselves.

18:29.426 --> 18:32.245
It is never to be sided with, not to be
sympathized

18:32.446 --> 18:36.470
but to be completely eradicated.

18:38.618 --> 18:42.680
Another side is the ego where we try
to dominate others and enjoy that.

18:42.881 --> 18:50.147
There’s no joy, there’s no joy in dominating
others and saying things to others.

18:51.153 --> 18:55.182
I was sorry to hear yesterday that there
are some girls who are married,

18:55.382 --> 18:57.422
some Indian girls who are married

18:57.623 --> 19:01.589
and their husbands are not respecting them
and troubling them.

19:01.790 --> 19:03.666
It hurt Me very much.

19:03.867 --> 19:08.004
That shows they’re so low-level people,
very low level.

19:08.205 --> 19:11.935
Such a mediocracy, such useless people.

19:12.107 --> 19:17.846
They should have never come to Sahaja
Yoga and deceived us like this.

19:18.983 --> 19:23.883
They will go to hell direct; I can tell you
this (much).

19:25.205 --> 19:30.941
Now there are some who are caught up
with their superego;

19:31.142 --> 19:37.439
they suffer from some sort of a funny
Sahaja Yoga schizophrenia.

19:38.327 --> 19:42.384
And they don’t want to get rid of it.

19:45.897 --> 19:50.450
They just don’t want to understand that
they’re not normal people,

19:50.623 --> 19:54.453
they have to be perfectly all right.

19:57.317 --> 20:01.122
They make everyone miserable,

20:02.280 --> 20:06.474
jump on to all the places where they should
not be.

20:06.674 --> 20:11.375
Like a person who has got, say, example,
tuberculosis, a disease which is contagious.

20:11.575 --> 20:14.433
Must understand he has got tuberculosis,
keep out,

20:14.634 --> 20:18.451
don’t give it to others, at least.

20:20.979 --> 20:26.013
But those who have got badhas will
definitely come,

20:26.201 --> 20:29.628
either they’ll give big lectures.

20:29.829 --> 20:34.882
I start seeing them like big bhoots
speaking,

20:35.082 --> 20:42.422
or if not - they have badhas then they will
come at a place where they should not be.

20:42.622 --> 20:46.592
They’ll put their hands in the prasada,
they’ll be sitting in the puja in the front,

20:46.793 --> 20:53.228
all kinds of things they’ll be doing,
catching people.

20:54.107 --> 20:57.149
And they enjoy it because they are
identified with the badhas.

20:57.350 --> 21:01.108
How will they improve?

21:07.631 --> 21:13.019
There’s one fellow who is a bhootish
fellow, we have had him for, I think,

21:13.219 --> 21:21.037
at least for a century I should say, and
he’s giving lectures to others,

21:21.238 --> 21:28.322
You must clean the shoes of all the Sahaja
Yogis to get rid of your ego.

21:28.489 --> 21:37.009
So such a gross, depraved and low-level
people are still in Sahaja Yoga.

21:38.460 --> 21:42.938
So the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga becomes
less.

21:43.139 --> 21:49.469
If you eat rice with stones in it, how
will you enjoy it?

21:51.515 --> 21:54.984
And that’s what it is.

21:56.267 --> 22:02.361
We are here to enjoy the blessings of God,

22:02.938 --> 22:08.828
to have the mirth but still we are living

22:09.512 --> 22:15.073
with all joy-killing things that we have.

22:16.154 --> 22:22.842
How are we going to get rid of those
things?

22:23.043 --> 22:29.820
So, at least we do not become thorns
in the lives of others.

22:31.653 --> 22:36.026
So the so-called free will, I’m happy
Rustom has told you about it,

22:36.226 --> 22:43.401
is nothing but your ego and superego
because you’re not in the center.

22:45.469 --> 22:53.581
In the center, you have nothing but
freedom, that’s all, nothing but freedom;

22:53.781 --> 23:01.413
nothing like free will, freedom, complete
freedom.

23:01.613 --> 23:07.022
There’s nothing like will or nothing like
bhoots,

23:07.222 --> 23:17.529
nothing like bondage, it’s entire avenue
of freedom.

23:23.708 --> 23:30.121
Then this freedom is the knowledge,

23:30.455 --> 23:39.180
this freedom is the love, this freedom
is the discretion.

23:39.380 --> 23:47.042
Then you say God gives you freedom and
others freedom equally;

23:47.243 --> 23:56.331
then you act which doesn’t bound you
nor anybody else

23:56.532 --> 24:01.976
because it is knowledge, it is discretion.

24:06.059 --> 24:12.453
Age does not matter, what age you are.
I’ve seen some also very old people

24:12.654 --> 24:20.889
singing beautifully and enjoying Sahaja
Yoga and make Me enjoy also.

24:22.654 --> 24:27.270
Life is for us to enjoy, nothing else.

24:27.470 --> 24:33.880
But because we’re not free people,
we cannot enjoy.

24:36.250 --> 24:48.037
There is no bondage of any evil thought
which keeps you down.

24:49.132 --> 24:57.243
It is so subtle but penetrating into every
that is gross,

24:57.444 --> 25:03.939
that is Shri Krishna’s beautiful flute

25:06.776 --> 25:11.997
which creates a picture of the nature.

25:12.198 --> 25:14.444
The description (Sanskrit words),

25:14.645 --> 25:21.456
the whole thing becomes silent like
a picture.

25:25.813 --> 25:33.051
So, this evening we’ll have the puja,
we’ll have all the enjoyment

25:33.251 --> 25:37.777
of Shri Krishna’s blessings upon us.

25:37.977 --> 25:45.650
There’s no end to the stories of Shri
Krishna, all full of mirth and play

25:45.850 --> 25:52.421
and innocence that kills rakshasas, devils.

25:53.834 --> 25:58.358
So today I’ve talked to you about His
childhood,

25:59.239 --> 26:04.131
and the puja I’ll tell you about Gita.

26:04.331 --> 26:07.494
May God bless you.

26:09.238 --> 26:11.988
Some water.

26:16.742 --> 26:21.225
Gregoire: Would You like a cup of tea,
Shri Mataji? Shri Mataji: Water.

26:22.335 --> 26:27.408
Gregoire: Tea is ready… water…
Shri Mataji: Please, I’ll have some water.

26:41.653 --> 26:47.302
You all are catching from Vishuddhi, I must
say, very badly.

26:47.502 --> 26:52.385
And I’m full of it, here. All My vibrations
are just flowing from here.

26:52.586 --> 26:58.710
So I would say that you all should say
“Allah Hu Akbar” sixteen times just now.

26:58.910 --> 27:04.038
Gregoire: We get up? (To yogis) Get up.

27:04.239 --> 27:08.844
[Yogis say “Allah Hu Akbar” 16 times]

28:15.385 --> 28:18.607
Shri Mataji: Feeling better now?

28:23.104 --> 28:25.541
If you go out, keep your Vishuddhis
covered,

28:25.742 --> 28:28.357
but I don’t think anybody should go out
today -

28:28.557 --> 28:32.767
in a way is good, for the puja - after
the puja tomorrow.

28:32.967 --> 28:35.327
Then watch your Vishuddhis to be alright
today,

28:35.495 --> 28:40.112
that’s why it has rained, I hope you
don’t mind.

28:40.312 --> 28:43.784
Gregoire: Please sit down, everybody.

28:49.783 --> 28:51.993
Shri Mataji: Ah, you wanted to have some
bhajans, something?

28:52.193 --> 28:54.406
Gregoire: Would You like some bhajans now?
Shri Mataji: Could have it…

28:54.606 --> 28:57.735
Gregoire: Good idea. (To yogis:) Can we
have some bhajans?

28:57.935 --> 29:00.762
One or two first songs? “We are the world”,
okay.

29:00.963 --> 29:05.529
Warren: As well as of saying “God is great”,
can we say “Mataji is great”, somehow?

29:05.730 --> 29:09.659
Somehow is there some way by which we could
say that? Because still it’s catching.

29:09.860 --> 29:12.102
Gregoire: Let’s have “We are the world”.
Eh? Shri Mataji: All right.

29:12.303 --> 29:13.723
Gregoire: Ah? What is it?
Shri Mataji: When we say…

29:13.924 --> 29:16.753
Warren: Mother, can we say “Shri Mataji”
is great? Again…

29:16.954 --> 29:21.012
Shri Mataji: Might be. Might be. Think it
now, what they say?

29:21.212 --> 29:28.799
Gregoire: Fantastic. Okay. We are going
to sing “We are the world”…

29:29.000 --> 29:33.080
…There are people seeking /

29:33.281 --> 29:39.212
And it's time to lend a hand to life /

29:39.413 --> 29:43.910
The greatest gift of all /

29:45.358 --> 29:52.495
They can't go on pretending day by day /

29:52.696 --> 29:59.670
That someone, somewhere will soon
make a change /

29:59.871 --> 30:07.724
We are all a part of God's great family

30:07.925 --> 30:14.884
And the truth, you know /
Love is all we need /

30:15.085 --> 30:22.449
We are the world, we are the children /

30:22.649 --> 30:29.915
We are the ones who make a brighter day /
So let's start giving /

30:30.116 --> 30:38.037
There's a choice we're making /
We're saving our own lives /

30:38.237 --> 30:45.291
It's true we'll make a better day
through Mataji /

30:46.317 --> 30:53.234
Send them your heart so they'll know
that someone cares /

30:53.435 --> 31:00.256
And their lives will be stronger and free /

31:00.457 --> 31:08.231
Our Mother gave us the Spirit
and its joy /

31:08.431 --> 31:15.339
So we all must lend a helping hand /

31:15.539 --> 31:22.495
We are the world, we are the children /

31:22.696 --> 31:30.171
We are the ones who make a brighter day /
So let's start giving /

31:30.371 --> 31:38.116
There's a choice we're making /
We're saving our own lives /

31:38.317 --> 31:45.473
It's true we'll make a better day
through Mataji /

31:45.793 --> 31:52.603
When you're down and out, there seems
no hope at all /

31:52.803 --> 32:00.275
But if you just believe, there's no way
we can fall /

32:00.476 --> 32:07.766
All let's realize that a change can
only come /

32:07.967 --> 32:14.645
When we stand together as one /

32:14.845 --> 32:21.876
We are the world, we are the children /

32:22.076 --> 32:29.352
We are the ones who make a brighter day /
So let's start giving /

32:29.553 --> 32:37.241
There's a choice we're making /
We're saving our own lives /

32:37.442 --> 32:43.986
It's true we'll make a better day
through Mataji /

32:44.187 --> 32:51.583
You are the world / You are the Mother /

32:51.783 --> 32:59.058
You are the One who makes a brighter day /
So let’s absorb it /

32:59.259 --> 33:07.157
In our hearts we meet You /
the greatest joy of all /

33:07.357 --> 33:14.201
It’s You who make a better day,
Shri Mataji /

33:14.639 --> 33:21.693
It’s You who make a better day,
Shri Mataji /

33:22.295 --> 33:36.511
It’s You who make a better day,
Shri Mataji /

33:42.471 --> 33:46.929
Gregoire: It’s not necessary to applaud
at ourselves!

33:47.130 --> 33:53.994
Shri Mataji: I was just waiting for Me
to clap, but ... everybody applauded.

33:54.194 --> 33:58.363
It’s good, you see, a very good song.

33:58.563 --> 34:00.792
But I think little change would be needed,

34:00.992 --> 34:04.409
to be good from vibrations point of view.
All right?

34:04.609 --> 34:10.653
Now. Let’s have another one.
Gregoire: Can we have the Italian one?

34:17.835 --> 34:25.308
What is it? Wait one minute, because we
are going to distribute the copies…

34:25.903 --> 34:29.261
to distribute the copies.

34:33.618 --> 34:37.769
Shri Mataji, the story of this song,
the music of this song

34:37.969 --> 34:40.877
is that there was this big musical which
was organized

34:41.077 --> 34:43.050
to raise money for Africa.

34:43.250 --> 34:46.119
And they took the music and they changed
the words.

34:46.319 --> 34:55.770
It’s a song which is coming from America.
And… one day….

35:41.687 --> 35:46.230
Shri Mataji (to the children): See how she’s
sitting? You sit all of you like that.

35:47.334 --> 35:51.995
Melania’s sitting properly, like a yogi.

36:23.698 --> 36:27.765
It’s written in English or in… It’s done
in English or in Italian?

36:27.966 --> 36:32.712
Yogis: In English.
Shri Mataji: Oh, good.

36:37.844 --> 36:42.373
How many of you know Italian?

36:44.430 --> 36:48.403
I’m going to join!

36:50.033 --> 36:53.817
Alright. That’s all.

36:55.029 --> 37:01.122
That’s one of the nearest language,
I think, one can learn very easily.

37:11.475 --> 37:15.813
But you must learn English
first!

37:24.540 --> 37:27.234
And the Spanish is another language
one can learn easily,

37:27.434 --> 37:31.950
if the Spanish learn the English.

37:40.268 --> 37:45.599
Or Hindi, one of the languages that I know.

37:59.604 --> 38:04.485
I also know American English, you know?

38:14.311 --> 38:20.186
Vishuddhi’s very much cleared out, can
you see that? Very good.

38:20.386 --> 38:23.564
Gregoire: We worked on the United States
by singing this, Shri Mataji.

38:23.764 --> 38:31.632
Shri Mataji: Yes. Good. I’m going there.
Alright, start it now.

38:34.560 --> 38:38.165
Antonio is going to start…

38:41.464 --> 38:45.425
Gregoire: It’s coming.
Shri Mataji: Coming.

42:17.263 --> 42:23.322
Shri Mataji: Beautiful song, eh?
What a nice song. Beautiful.

42:36.176 --> 42:39.380
Wonderful…

42:39.675 --> 42:48.131
It’s a real fast (…), I must say.
Beautiful. Very nice.

42:48.728 --> 42:54.490
Gregoire: Which one next?
Yogi: Germany.

42:56.436 --> 42:59.210
Yogi: Belgium.
Yogi: Belgium.

42:59.411 --> 43:04.646
Yogi: We have a German song all in English.
Gregoire: What else?

43:04.846 --> 43:12.313
Yogi: French song in English, Swiss song
in English…

43:16.110 --> 43:17.999
Gregoire: Whatever you desire, Mother?
Shri Mataji: Anything,

43:18.200 --> 43:20.504
I’m alright for everything…

43:20.710 --> 43:24.389
Yogi: The English, in English.

43:24.590 --> 43:29.192
Yogi: We can start with the English
in English!

43:51.019 --> 43:53.743
Shri Mataji: Thank you.

44:35.514 --> 44:39.546
It’s for English in English!

44:47.015 --> 44:52.012
Yogi: Does everybody have one page?
Yogis: No, no.

44:52.212 --> 44:55.928
Gregoire: It’s one song to Lord Krishna.

48:18.811 --> 48:22.529
Shri Mataji: Great, wonderful!

48:22.729 --> 48:29.439
Nice power is shown! May God bless you
all for this.

48:30.413 --> 48:36.303
Now, who else? Another?

48:36.794 --> 48:40.411
French, of course!

48:42.792 --> 48:45.750
Beautiful.

48:46.395 --> 48:49.991
That’s very nice song, I should say,

48:50.191 --> 48:55.025
like a marching song, is good idea.

49:11.772 --> 49:15.152
Yogi: The French song.

49:36.981 --> 49:40.450
Yogi: The French song.

49:42.558 --> 49:48.347
Shri Mataji: Very good one! For the French
to sing this I’m very happy.

49:50.969 --> 49:55.934
You won’t believe! “Les miserables”,
you see, people with the background.

49:56.135 --> 50:04.487
It’s a great, eh? To see you all smiling
like that! It’s great!

50:04.750 --> 50:09.720
Imagine, what a transformation.

50:12.125 --> 50:15.686
Real transformation, I'll say.

50:19.274 --> 50:24.354
[The French song is about “the Joy
of the Kingdom of God”]

52:38.229 --> 52:42.700
Shri Mataji: That’s a good preparation
for the Krishna Puja,

52:42.900 --> 52:47.425
so wonderful, you see, to hear this from
the French specially.

52:47.625 --> 52:50.859
May God bless you.

52:53.392 --> 52:56.150
Now, who else?

52:59.854 --> 53:02.310
Yogi: Swiss song in English.

53:02.510 --> 53:04.454
Gregoire: Swiss song in English,
Shri Mataji.

53:04.654 --> 53:07.551
Shri Mataji: Good idea.

53:12.162 --> 53:15.669
I should get one paper.

53:17.955 --> 53:22.440
That’s a good idea, that every country
should have one song, you see,

53:22.641 --> 53:32.037
to be sung, so that everyone gets the
chance, and to make a nice positive song.

54:12.600 --> 54:16.760
Yogi: In the page of the Swiss song you
have also the German song,

54:16.960 --> 54:20.517
so you keep the page after.

54:33.730 --> 54:36.525
Shri Mataji: Pen.

54:37.532 --> 54:42.403
Yogi: So, the title is “Seed in the Earth”.
