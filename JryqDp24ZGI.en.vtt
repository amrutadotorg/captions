00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.444
It is how many vibrations you have within
yourself is the point, which one should see.

00:00:15.803 --> 00:00:19.249
First the vibrations when they are,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.217
how are we to know we are all right
as far as vibrations are concerned?

00:00:24.418 --> 00:00:34.204
What is the sign of being a good Sahaja
Yogi, or we are really Sahaja Yogi,

00:00:34.405 --> 00:00:40.560
is that we develop a kind of a detachment.

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:48.820
First the detachment comes naturally
because you are away from your body,

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:54.918
so you are not bothered about your body,
you don’t think about it.

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:58.262
That doesn’t mean you do not look after it.

00:00:58.463 --> 00:01:02.721
It doesn’t mean that you don’t have
any sense of how you look

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:07.946
and how you move about, because you
have to be decently dressed also.

00:01:08.147 --> 00:01:12.747
But attachment means that all the time
thinking,

00:01:12.948 --> 00:01:15.629
“This chakra is catching, that chakra
is catching,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.468
my head is catching, my Agnya is catching,
this is happening.”

00:01:21.732 --> 00:01:27.911
This is the subtler way how Sahaja Yoga
can ruin you, is this all the time thinking,

00:01:28.112 --> 00:01:32.178
“This is wrong, this is wrong”, condemning
yourself.

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:34.594
So this detachment has to be there about
yourself,

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:38.853
“No, doesn’t matter, so what, I’m like
a barometer.

00:01:38.934 --> 00:01:41.785
If I go near somebody and if I catch
well and good, you see,

00:01:41.866 --> 00:01:44.419
I’m just helping that person, well
and good.”

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:49.617
Or you give yourself a bandhan and just
approach somebody.

00:01:49.818 --> 00:01:54.883
So worrying too much about your chakras
is not a very good thing

00:01:55.084 --> 00:02:00.742
for the progress of Sahaja Yoga. On the
contrary, you should try to meditate,

00:02:00.943 --> 00:02:06.135
don’t think of individual chakras, just
meditate with your heart.

00:02:06.336 --> 00:02:13.257
So now you will see from My lecture,
or whatever you call this,

00:02:13.458 --> 00:02:20.521
is that you have to have a heart which
is open to Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:20.722 --> 00:02:25.511
When your heart is open, first of all
you forgive yourself

00:02:25.712 --> 00:02:29.700
and you forgive others, and you don’t see
to your individual chakras

00:02:29.901 --> 00:02:35.112
or bother about others, in the way that
you are concerned

00:02:35.313 --> 00:02:41.151
about one individual, but you look
at the whole as a whole.
