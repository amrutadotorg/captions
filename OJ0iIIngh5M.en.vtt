00:14.371 --> 00:21.213
Then second thing of Sahaja Yoga is that
it is the power of love,

00:21.414 --> 00:24.855
it’s of compassion, of divine love.

00:25.056 --> 00:28.664
Must understand what is divine love is.

00:28.865 --> 00:33.505
That is the love that is the, like the sap,
as I always say,

00:33.706 --> 00:42.799
that runs in the tree. It gives nourishment
to the roots,

00:43.000 --> 00:53.846
then to all parts of the tree, and then
it evaporates or it goes down.

00:54.046 --> 01:01.994
Supposing it gets stuck into one flower,
what will happen

01:02.195 --> 01:07.170
that the tree will die, and ultimately
the flower will also die.

01:07.371 --> 01:12.882
So our love is not limited love.

01:13.083 --> 01:17.212
Like, we love our children, all right,
[we] love other children also.

01:17.413 --> 01:26.640
Everybody is absolutely in full pure love
with each other.

01:26.841 --> 01:35.268
Now, one must understand the pure love,
that it is not attached to anyone,

01:35.469 --> 01:39.471
but at the same time, it is pure love.

01:39.672 --> 01:49.111
If you don’t have pure love in your heart
because the culture is different,

01:49.326 --> 02:01.265
people start moving their attention and
spoiling their attention.

02:01.741 --> 02:05.427
So, so many people asked Me: “Mother,
what to do?”

02:05.628 --> 02:09.789
I said: “Keep your eyes only up to three
feet,

02:09.990 --> 02:14.060
so you will see beautiful things, like you
will see flowers,

02:14.261 --> 02:19.558
you will see children, and nothing
horrible”.

02:19.759 --> 02:27.479
So, whatever makes your attention
disturbed, try to avoid.

02:27.680 --> 02:33.104
Best is to concentrate on your meditation.

02:33.663 --> 02:40.606
For meditation in the morning you can
just put

02:40.807 --> 02:45.420
your right hand towards the photograph

02:47.985 --> 02:51.934
and the left hand up there.

02:52.215 --> 02:58.457
Then put your left hand towards
the photograph… - like this.

02:58.823 --> 03:04.558
Then left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

03:04.759 --> 03:10.644
[It] is better to sit on the ground,
in the morning.

03:11.199 --> 03:17.930
Then, if thoughtless awareness is
established

03:18.130 --> 03:22.641
by looking at the photograph, close your
eyes.

03:22.911 --> 03:27.844
Now, some people say: “Mother, my heart
is not open”. All right.

03:28.045 --> 03:32.682
So you can say, looking at the Mother:

03:32.883 --> 03:38.815
“Mother, please, come in my heart.”

03:39.016 --> 03:42.282
Somebody’s Sahasrara is not open.

03:42.482 --> 03:46.622
Then you have to say: “Mother, please
come in my head”.

03:46.823 --> 03:49.592
With both the hands.

03:49.793 --> 03:56.562
Whatever portion you think in the body
is not doing well,

03:56.763 --> 04:02.461
I am always available, so you can ask.

04:04.565 --> 04:07.792
Your meditation should be good, first
and foremost.

04:07.993 --> 04:13.824
If you are good Sahaja Yogis, then only
others will believe you.

04:14.024 --> 04:19.286
But if you are not good Sahaja Yogis,
nobody will believe you.

04:19.487 --> 04:23.728
For so many people I have seen I am
something beyond them.

04:23.929 --> 04:28.401
But Sahaja Yogis are the ones which really
make them feel

04:28.602 --> 04:32.697
that “these are extraordinary people”.

04:35.406 --> 04:41.548
Then, after that, dealing with them
as I said,

04:41.749 --> 04:48.775
has to be absolutely with pure attention.

04:48.976 --> 04:52.290
To begin with, the men should deal only
with men

04:52.491 --> 04:56.747
and the women should deal only with women

04:56.948 --> 04:59.979
and no complications should come out.

05:00.180 --> 05:04.349
Because that is the biggest blemish Sahaja
Yoga can have,

05:04.550 --> 05:08.837
that they are just like ordinary people.

05:12.649 --> 05:17.092
So, you have to be careful about yourself.

05:17.293 --> 05:21.972
Before sleeping, if you have time, you must
do footsoaking.

05:22.173 --> 05:25.237
If one day you do not do it, don’t torture
yourself for that,

05:25.438 --> 05:29.464
but it’s better that you do footsoaking.

05:29.665 --> 05:34.500
And in footsoaking first of all you
must know

05:34.701 --> 05:38.870
what sort of a personality you have.

05:39.102 --> 05:42.445
Mostly you are right-sided, mostly.

05:42.646 --> 05:45.505
So put [your] right hand towards
the photograph,

05:45.706 --> 05:51.780
both the feet in the water with little salt
and left hand like that.

05:51.981 --> 05:55.442
But some are left-sided, some are
definitely very much.

05:55.643 --> 05:58.645
They should not touch water.

05:58.846 --> 06:05.025
Two types of treatments are there.

06:05.226 --> 06:10.167
Especially left-sided people should
not soak,

06:10.368 --> 06:15.663
should not use ice. This is all right-sided
treatment.

06:15.864 --> 06:21.216
After doing your right-sided or left-sided
treatment,

06:21.417 --> 06:27.669
I would say you put both your hands towards
the photograph

06:28.226 --> 06:32.897
and see for yourself how it is working out,

06:34.809 --> 06:38.964
without water, without candle.

06:39.276 --> 06:42.985
But I would again say that right-sided
people should not

06:43.186 --> 06:47.133
use candle as far as possible.

06:49.527 --> 06:54.692
This electricity is all right, you can
use it.

06:54.893 --> 06:57.646
They should not sit in the sun, they should
put

06:57.847 --> 07:01.643
ice on their liver; also they can put ice
here

07:01.844 --> 07:05.034
when it is very hot, it’s very good to put
ice here.

07:05.235 --> 07:09.768
Also for diabetes you can put the ice here.

07:11.345 --> 07:14.693
In Sahaja Yoga the treatment is very
simple:

07:14.894 --> 07:19.556
for right-sided people very simple, and
for left-sided.

07:19.757 --> 07:23.974
Right-sided people get problems like liver,

07:24.175 --> 07:30.520
diabetes, blood cancer,

07:31.878 --> 07:35.730
kidney coagulation,

07:35.931 --> 07:41.446
that means they can’t pass urine,
constipation,

07:41.960 --> 07:48.634
also asthma, heart attack – massive,

07:48.835 --> 07:58.115
and also paralysis, on the right side;
so many.

07:58.316 --> 08:05.503
Now, the left-sided people get pain
all over left side;

08:05.704 --> 08:12.616
also can get all kinds of psychosomatic
diseases which are not curable,

08:12.817 --> 08:21.718
like cancer, myelitis, Parkinson’s,
all kinds.

08:23.195 --> 08:25.778
But if you do your meditation every day,

08:25.979 --> 08:28.695
once in a while you may miss it, it doesn’t
matter,

08:28.895 --> 08:33.795
you will immediately feel that you are
completely cured

08:33.996 --> 08:37.756
and you keep good health.

08:37.957 --> 08:41.532
That’s the only way you can grow.

08:41.733 --> 08:50.045
And try to bring the point where you are
thoughtlessly aware.

08:50.246 --> 08:57.851
The best way to be thoughtless is to say
the mantra of Nirvichara.

08:58.467 --> 09:02.438
That’s very important. And secondly,

09:02.639 --> 09:05.230
to go on for forgiving: “I forgive
everyone, I forgive everyone”

09:05.431 --> 09:13.075
so the thoughts will stop. That is the time
when you are in the present.

09:13.276 --> 09:19.429
That is the time really you will grow
in spirituality.
