00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.120
I must have said lots of things about Christ before,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.800
and how Jesus Christ is related to Shri Radhaji,

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.120
that He is the incarnation

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.720
of Sri Ganesha who was the son of the Adi Shakti

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.360
to begin with but then He was given to Shri Radhaji

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:33.440
and Shri Radha created as Mahalaxmi, as Mother Mary

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.480
this great incarnation of Christ.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.880
Now for the western mind it is impossible to understand

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.560
how there can be a immaculate conception

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.080
because they have no sense at all, no sensitivity at all

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.040
to spiritual life. We Indians can understand it,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.440
is very easy for Indians to understand

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.560
because we had Sri Ganesha created that way.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.360
We just believe it we don't doubt these things.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.760
Whatever is said about God is not to be doubted

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.080
with this limited brain, that's not done in India.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.200
But in the west, from the very birth of Christ

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.720
they have had arguments, arguments, arguments, arguments

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.320
with this limited brain they had,

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.240
and the whole religion in the name of Christ

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.560
is just a perversion, such a horrible things have been said

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.240
that it's unbelievable. His purity, His  holiness, His  auspiciousness

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.920
is never understood in the west I think.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:47.240
Those who follow Christianity, how can they be so debased

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.720
in their moral character. They're all right for their political,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.800
their economical you can say, their legal side but their moral sense

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.720
is absolutely missing. Is very surprising,

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.000
those who are the followers of Christ

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.920
should have the greatest amount of morality.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:16.960
He has said that thou shalt not have adulterous eyes,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.720
such a subtle thing, even the eye should not have adultery,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.960
should not have lust and greed. Such a subtle thing He has said it,

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.240
and just think in the west people could not follow it

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.640
because the whole religion got perverted

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.640
under the influence of Paul and Peter. It's a very serious thing

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.760
they have done against Christ, it's still going on.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.280
Still this Catholic church, though being exposed so much,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.960
is still going on, in India also all over,

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.120
is stupid this Protestant church also is going on everywhere.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.040
What good name have they brought to Christ? One should see.

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.080
The first and foremost thing He has said

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:16.720
that you must enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.960
that you must be born again.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.120
So it's all mental, you are born again,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.760
you have a certificate, you are born again, finished.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.680
So this mental attitude of the west is responsible

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:40.520
for killing the great incarnation of Christ,

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.800
I think is another crucifixion.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.640
Mentally you cannot understand spirituality.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.080
So they were telling your brain trust, brain trust,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.800
I said brain trusting-I can't understand in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:05.640
In Sahaja Yoga what is the brain trust? Where is the brain?

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.720
In thoughtless awareness where is the brain?

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.520
So this brain trust business might be all right

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.600
for any other place but for Sahaja Yoga, I still don't understand

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.800
what do you do in brain trust. Because some people

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.200
want to come on the stage and speak you see,

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:36.160
they have a kind of a madness, they can't get over it.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.720
So they might be coming to the brain trust maybe,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:49.080
but it's not brain, it's the heart, is the heart

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.240
which has to be opened out because with the brain

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.520
what we do is all kinds of materialism.

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.360
All kinds of nonsense has come from human brain only,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.520
not so much from animals brain.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:14.120
You can see  if you go to any forest it's clean, nice,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.560
smelling so well,  but put one human being there and you will know

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.080
that this filth, dirt has come from some human being.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:32.240
So as it is they have made a mess of all the great incarnations

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:39.400
but worst is done to Christ and I feel what a waste it was.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.880
So we must understand Christ

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.680
in the right sense, He is the eternal child,

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:55.040
He is the innocence itself, He's the source of innocence

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.200
and He is the bestower of all blessings in all chakras.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.600
But that doesn't mean that you are Christians, you should be very

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.400
proud that oh She's talking about Christ.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.960
Many I've seen Sahaja Yogis are still identified with Christ

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:17.320
while they have nothing to do with Christ at all.

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:28.560
Now one has to understand that how Christ in His  miraculous life

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:32.040
has shown so many miracles.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.440
First of all His  birth was immaculate.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:38.800
So now they are discussing the birth of Mary

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.440
whether it's immaculate or not. For all incarnations

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.440
every kind of birth is immaculate, they are beyond sins,

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.760
they are special people. They may come as human beings,

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.120
they may come as angels, they may come as anything,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.600
they are divine and we should understand

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:58.240
that this little brain of ours cannot discuss about them

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.400
and talk about them but is to just surrender and worship them.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:09.000
They are much beyond us.

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:15.280
So for the western mind it is important to understand

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.000
that the life of Christ was such a blessing for them

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:23.040
that they have lost it, they have wasted it

00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:26.880
and they have never understood how to respect it.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.760
The whole thing became

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:37.720
like a political, economical, nonsensical fraud.

00:07:41.640 --> 00:07:46.280
I have told you long time back that how we can prove

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:50.680
that Christ was Ganesha and He was the logos,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.240
He was the what we call is the Brahmanat, the first sound.

00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:04.600
By looking at your left side from the right side,

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:09.320
if you see the Mooladhara you will see swastikas

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:13.040
because it is made of carbon atom.

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:17.720
If you see from left to the right you can see Omkara

00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.600
and if you see from down upward it looks like Alpha and Omega.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:29.720
In those days Christ has said I am the Alpha and I am the Omega

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.800
and now we have made the animation,

00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.680
we have no arrangement to show you there,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:36.120
I don't know if you could arrange it somehow,

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:41.880
but you can see it clearly, what I have said can be proved.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:47.200
So as you worship Ganesha you must worship Christ

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.840
in the same manner for all those who worship Ganesha.

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:56.120
Because I have seen that Hindus, they are stuck to Ganesha

00:08:56.320 --> 00:09:04.600
and Christians are stuck to Christ, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:09.720
they carry those traits. Ganesha is all right up to a point

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.720
and then it is important

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:17.880
we must pray to His  incarnation that is Christ.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.880
In the same way those who worship Christ must also worship Ganesha

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.320
because He is the source, He is the potential of Christ.

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.680
All this was in the Divine plan, done with Divine discretion,

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:40.440
everything was done so beautifully but as I told you

00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:45.200
human beings are good at massacring anything that is beautiful

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:48.720
and that's how it has happened. It's very, very sad

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.640
and on His  birthday today we have to decide

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:57.400
that He has to be born within us again, in a proper way,

00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.640
that He is the Alpha and the Omega.

00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:04.920
At that time of His  time I didn't know that anybody knew

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.240
about these symbols. These symbols also must have come

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:14.160
from unconscious to some of the great mathematicians

00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:17.560
in long time and that's why these symbols

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.600
are used exactly like Alpha and Omega,

00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:28.720
you see him clearly. It is so clear cut now in Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:32.720
we can prove so many things all tangible;

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:37.720
how Christ used to cure people, what did He do, it's all tangible,

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.840
we can prove it now in Sahaja Yoga, how it works out,

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:47.680
how these powers work out, but we have to first of all

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:53.120
cleanse our lives, we have to lead a very honest,

00:10:53.240 --> 00:11:00.320
powerful and pure life. I've seen those stalls outside,

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.720
I told them not to put up any stalls here

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:08.760
because they are making profit for themselves not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:13.320
Once Christ saw like that and He took a hunter and hit all of them,

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.360
now I can't do that. One should not encourage these people,

00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:25.200
it's not a shopping centre, you have come for meditation.

00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:29.000
Is all right if you need anything we have bought things for you,

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.160
if you buy them, there might be little profit, may not be,

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:36.040
but that will go to Sahaja Yoga, is not going to be used

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.760
for any private purpose. But these people from outside come

00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:43.840
and put up a stall and you all run about means

00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.720
you are still hanging around with that thing,

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:49.520
you have come here for what?

00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:58.280
One should be all the time meditative in Ganapatipule,

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.640
all the time you should be in a meditative condition

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.880
and shouldn't get to these mundane things

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.760
which you always do outside also.

00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:12.720
But these people know that you still have those weaknesses,

00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:15.720
that's why they have put up the stalls.

00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:24.160
Leaders should stop all this nonsense, I've told not to eat outside.

00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:27.000
Last time all of you suffered because of that

00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:30.160
but still the stalls are on, that means see they know

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:34.120
there are some culprits who would like to buy things from them

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:39.120
and get sick and bring bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:43.880
So the first thing of Ganesha is that wisdom,

00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.680
and that wisdom we see in the life of Christ,

00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:55.440
from the very beginning, He was so confident of it

00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:02.400
that at the age of twelve years He went and talked to these parses,

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.080
means the people who were priests, we still have priests

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.080
and mullahs and these burgees and all of them,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:15.120
these so called dharmamantandas, all over,

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:20.200
but He went and argued with them at that young age

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.000
and He was just saying what are you doing here.

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.840
What is this? What are you talking, all lip service.

00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:36.280
He was discussing and talking to them

00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.440
but His  parents were perhaps, were frightened that these people

00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:43.000
might kill him so they brought him to India,

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.120
He came to India for wisdom.

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:49.640
I don't know where is that wisdom missing now from Indians,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.640
but must be this country was full of wisdom when He came

00:13:52.760 --> 00:14:00.400
and stayed in India and we have lots of memories

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:06.760
about him, even the King Shaliman met him, is described in his book

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:11.040
that He met a man in Cashmere who was very saintly

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.200
and He asked him what's your name?

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:20.400
He said my name is Isa, see now imagine-Isa.

00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:26.320
I is the word used in the Vedas for the Adi Shakti-

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.640
Sa means with.He said my name is Isa,

00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:33.640
He said from what country do you come.

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:37.760
He said I come from a country which is foreign to me

00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:41.640
and this is my country.

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.200
So this India, the Bharat, the Hindustan

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:51.080
was the country of spirituality, and one should not try to compete

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:53.720
and feel inferior to other countries

00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:56.600
who have gone up materially higher,

00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:00.080
you don't know where they are,

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.000
but we should be spiritually higher,

00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:10.680
that's what Christ said. This is my own country, is clearly written,

00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.080
that means Christ recognised

00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:17.480
that this country of spirituality is His  own.

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.720
So we belong to that country of spirituality

00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:25.400
and not to the materialistic

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:31.160
or to the mundane or the baser type of life.

00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:40.480
In His  life time which was so very short,

00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:48.440
whatever He has said, every word is great but as I told you

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:55.680
that this Paul tried to completely change, re-edit the bible

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.200
and he's put lots of things in there, whatever weaknesses he has,

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:03.520
he has put them nicely.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:10.960
Now recently I've got a book which was hidden in a jar in Egypt

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:16.200
for about, till fifty years they discovered it,

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.040
and this book is called as the Library of Hamadhi.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.760
The place was called Hamadhi

00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:24.680
were it was discovered, and what Christ has said,

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.840
what Thomas has written, when Thomas was coming to India

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.880
he put all these things there, is very interesting.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.160
About drinking, he said drinking begets debauchery,

00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.720
it's a bad word to use and while Christians don't know.

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:45.560
On the contrary they think that drinking is allowed in Christianity,

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:50.120
very nicely. Was He mad to allow drinking?

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.640
How can He allow drinking

00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.880
which goes against your awareness,

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:01.240
but they thought it was nice,

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:07.600
and that's what people have been using as a big attraction

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:10.720
that you can drink in Christianity.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.600
So in the other religion, like Catholic religion,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.760
you could have only once the Marriage.

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:23.800
So they have one marriage and ten keeps,

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.320
is all right, allowed, in the bible is written,

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.960
only you can have one marriage you cannot divorce,

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:34.520
do what you like. No sense of morality

00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:41.120
and everything came like a derailment towards themselves

00:17:41.240 --> 00:17:45.760
and they accepted one after another, all kinds of nonsense,

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.240
and the basic thing of Christ's life is morality.

00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:55.880
He is on the left side as you can see he's from Sri Ganesh

00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.000
and then He establishes himself at Agnya,

00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:05.600
but morality is the essence of His  life,

00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:11.440
what we call in India language His  character.

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:20.280
Our character is how we lead a life of purity.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:23.560
We indulge into all kinds of nonsense,

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:29.200
I mean if you go to the west you'll be amazed what things they do.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.040
I mean you cannot even believe it

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.560
and I cannot even mention it to you, you won't believe

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:39.840
that these so called advanced countries

00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.320
are advancing towards what.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:47.240
Impossible we cannot conceive it even,

00:18:48.320 --> 00:19:01.400
such an impurity, such a horrible, destructive immorality,

00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:03.440
and I don't know from where it comes,

00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:05.600
I think it's something wrong with the genetics,

00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:11.120
from where do they get these ideas. One after another

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:16.520
it's impossible to believe these people doing all these things

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:20.160
and then nicely dress up and go to church on Sunday,

00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:27.880
pray to God and come back. Now it is for you to decide,

00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.240
you have to pull out all these people in your own countries

00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:34.680
and you have to tell them

00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.880
this is all nonsense in the name of Christ, in the name of God.

00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:44.800
You have to come up and talk about it,

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:49.760
same about Sri Ganesh. I have seen in Poona, I was surprised,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:55.200
there was Ganesh ........... everybody was drinking nicely,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.720
the horrible dirty songs, some western songs,

00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:02.640
some horrible cinema songs put up there

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:08.880
and everybody was using as a disco in front of Sri Ganesh.

00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:12.960
Sahaja Yogis should go and object to this kind of a nonsense

00:20:13.080 --> 00:20:16.760
they are in, that how could they drink in the presence of Sri Ganesh.

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:27.880
No wisdom of Sri Ganesha, no respect for His  auspiciousness.

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:32.920
Now not only drinking, doing all kinds of things.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:36.440
Sri Ganesha has been shown by these tantrikas

00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.680
as something so horrible, which is also done

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.720
by so many psychologists, so called, in the west.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.160
Thank God one of them, th is Mr. Freud is exposed now.

00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:57.600
So the another quality of Ganesha, is shown in Christ's life,

00:20:57.720 --> 00:21:05.360
is a devotion to Mother. In that book,

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:12.080
Mary is telling them about knowledge,

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:16.800
but this Paul objects to it,

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:23.120
and She says that this is what you have to achieve.

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:26.760
But he doesn't want to, he is arguing with her,

00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:35.080
but then Thomas said that what Christ has said on the Cross

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:42.720
"Behold the Mother". She is the Mother of Christ

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:48.000
and how dare he insult Her  but just the opposite,

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:55.840
Paul never respected women, so he appointed,

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:01.000
I mean he called Her  as just a woman.

00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:05.600
No respect for Mahalaxmi, no respect.

00:22:08.360 --> 00:22:11.280
Can you imagine, just a woman,

00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:13.440
and a big controversy going on

00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:17.960
on these so called advanced people whether the women

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.520
should be ordained as priests or not.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.000
We think we are very backward

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:28.720
but I think they are so backward in religion, nonsense.

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:35.480
We had [...] such people here and we respect the Mother

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:40.080
as the Adi Shakti, she is the one we call her,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.160
the one who has created us.

00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:44.720
She is the one who looks after us,

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:47.840
for us she is important, Shakti is important,

00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:52.600
they don't call her Shakti but a woman,

00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:58.960
and supposed to be very advanced people,

00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.240
and all other nonsense they do in the name of advancement.

00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:14.240
It's impossible to tell, my words fall short, feel so ashamed.

00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:17.520
In the name of Christ!

00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:24.640
Today now when we are celebrating the pure life of Christ,

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:28.760
He came on this earth. They can't believe

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:33.560
that He could have been so pure. A criminal cannot believe

00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:36.480
that others could be non criminal.

00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:46.200
So we have to within ourselves see if we have developed

00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.760
that purity of mind that expresses through our eyes.

00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.840
Eyes have to become innocent, otherwise they have no effect.

00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.400
If you are hankering after attracting other people

00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.120
and charming other people and all that,

00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:11.560
you are not a Sahaja Yogi, there's no need.

00:24:11.680 --> 00:24:15.960
Once the light is within yourself, people will know.

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:21.040
As Sahaja Yogis you have to have

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:25.800
the light of Christ in your own life.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:32.960
He was a young man who came on this earth, and how He lived.

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:39.080
He had nothing to do with Mary Magdalen, who was a prostitute,

00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:44.120
but He stood by truth, and when people started stoning her

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:49.720
He stood up and said those who have   not committed any sin

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:55.480
can throw the stone at me. What a strength of truth.

00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:02.560
So not that only He was a pure personality but purity also

00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:07.680
is expressed in truth and His  compassion and love.

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:14.160
Such compassion He has expressed, such compassion.

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:18.360
I think Sri Ganesha got a little transformation.

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:23.600
Sri Ganesha is definitely very compassionate to people

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:29.680
who are worshipping him but those who go against them

00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:35.760
He hits them hard.............they have to suffer,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.480
AIDS , this, that, everything comes.

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:47.280
But those who are pure people, Sri Ganesha protects.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.400
But Christ is compassionate, He forgives

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:54.800
because He believes that there could be a transformation.

00:25:55.640 --> 00:26:01.720
At the level of Sri Ganesha He thinks is better

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:05.640
that let them be killed and be born again

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:09.280
because they're so impure but Christ had hopes

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:11.720
that He can transform people,

00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:16.600
but He could not, they crucified him.

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.200
What wonderful people they must have been to crucify Christ.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:27.320
Brainless we should call them, absolutely

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.840
without any understanding about spirituality,

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:38.480
very insensitive to true knowledge.

00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.960
So for Sahaja Yoga, only the wise can follow.

00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:49.680
It is not meant for stupid idiotic people

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:53.400
nor it is meant for very smart ones.

00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.440
Some people think they are very smart

00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.240
because they are successful in life,

00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:04.600
they can say some smart sentences, they can say something very,

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.840
outstandingly very sharp, it's not meant for that.

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:16.280
For that Christ has said meek in heart will inherit the earth.

00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.800
Meek in heart, not those who think too much of themselves

00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:27.240
but for meek in heart will inherit the earth.

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.640
Among Sahaja Yogis also only those who are meek in heart

00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.960
will inherit the blessing of Mother.

00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:39.720
You have to be meek,

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.400
you have to be wise and with wisdom you'll become meek

00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:46.680
because then you will see where are we

00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:49.680
into this great cosmos,

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:56.720
that, you will feel that you have entered into this Kingdom of God.

00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:02.000
For what? How? How have we come here?

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.720
How have you entered here? So many tried,

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.600
thousands of years sacrificing this,  sacrificing that,

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:14.520
standing on their heads, fasting.

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:17.840
How is it suddenly we got this blessing?

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.240
How are we there?

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.240
When we start looking at this,   we become meek.

00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.400
Is the blessing, is the grace.

00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:32.720
It's not through our ego, through our conditionings

00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:35.480
but is just the grace,

00:28:35.800 --> 00:28:39.840
the compassion, the love the Sandrakaruna,

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:47.680
and then you enjoy your transformed life,

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:55.600
the new dimension of spirituality which is in reality.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:59.000
Now you know reality, you know totality, you know everything

00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:02.040
but those who have not known themselves

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.680
have not become Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.680
Tukarama has said in very simple words,

00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:18.400
the one who has known himself is the last one.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:21.840
You can judge the chakras of others

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.560
but you can't judge your own chakras,

00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:26.400
you can introspect others,

00:29:26.520 --> 00:29:29.160
you can judge others but you cannot judge yourself.

00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:31.760
You know everything about others but about yourself

00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:36.800
you don't know anything, then you are not Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.240
First thing you must know yourself.

00:29:39.360 --> 00:29:41.720
What sort of an ego stuff I am doing.

00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.800
What sort of a conditioning I have got.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:48.480
Even now people have so many conditionings.

00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.520
So there's a new discipline of Sahaja Yoga,

00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:55.840
in the new discipline you have to be meek, humble

00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.240
and you have to be wise.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:05.080
Every step of yours, every talk of yours,

00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:08.520
everything should express wisdom

00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:12.080
and the Sahaj discipline which automatically stops you

00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.760
from doing wrong things.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.760
Now say I'm walking down and some lady suddenly

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.600
falls at My feet without even understanding that I am just walking,

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:26.320
I may fall down or catches hold of My feet.

00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:29.840
Is all self oriented.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.520
I should see Mother, I should go and meet Her,

00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.320
I touched Her feet, is all ego.

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:43.680
A Sahaja Yogi stands in the back,

00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:47.120
real Sahaja Yogi is at the back.

00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:52.560
From there he can enjoy because he knows I am everywhere.

00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:59.280
He doesn't want to see Me, nothing, just like this, standing.

00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:04.760
He doesn't force his way in any way.

00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:07.640
Mother is here.

00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:15.160
But this is what it is Christ has said, meek in heart.

00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:19.080
There's a very big word "meek" and people don't understand meek

00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:21.960
because in the west if you are meek people say you are weak,

00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:24.760
you have to be aggressive. If they have to praise somebody

00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:27.960
they'll say, oh he is very good, he is very aggressive.

00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:32.280
I think their genetics are little lower than normal,

00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:37.480
must be some animals in them otherwise how can they think

00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:42.280
that to be aggressive is being something higher.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:50.080
It's impossible, how can a person who is

00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:55.120
supposed to be a higher person, could be like a devil.

00:31:56.280 --> 00:31:59.360
How could Hitler say that he was a higher race

00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:02.120
when he was himself a devil?

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:06.600
Is very nice for a devil to say I am a higher race.

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:15.280
So in dealing in Sahaja Yoga, the sweetness of natural meekness

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:20.960
not artificial of a businessman but a natural one

00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:31.040
that makes you shine with your great, great spirituality.

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.640
Nobody can touch you, I have told you, except for you.

00:32:35.760 --> 00:32:40.160
You can only fall down but nobody can touch you,

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.240
you are all protected from every angle.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.040
B ut if you want to hit yourself, I can't help it.

00:32:47.760 --> 00:32:50.240
So again we come to Tukarama saying,

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:54.960
as Christ has said "know thyself ".

00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:02.120
First and foremost thing of introspection is: "Know thyself".

00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:08.280
What you are doing,

00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:12.120
are you trying to look at yourself or not?

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:21.520
He has also said that we see a big beam into the eyes of others,

00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.240
then it's all right, but the beam is in your eyes

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.360
and you start seeing the beam in others eyes and that's the point.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:38.120
So in your meditation you have to sit down

00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:41.720
and first of all introspect: "Oh Christ,

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.280
Oh Sri Ganesha,  please give me wisdom to see myself

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:53.160
and understand what's wrong with me, and understand

00:33:53.280 --> 00:34:00.760
where do I lack all the qualities of a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:09.000
Just to meditate and you feel so happy, so joyous,

00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.240
because virtue within you gives you joy.

00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:16.760
But you don't say I'm virtuous, you don't say that,

00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:19.760
but the virtue within you, when you discover,

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.440
that gives you joy

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:28.640
and not your bad qualities and your hankerings,

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.400
your lust and greed, no it does not.

00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:39.680
So we must really concentrate, even coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:34:39.800 --> 00:34:45.880
people think how I can use it for say fame?

00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:51.000
Leadership you see is another myth. Then they sometimes think

00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:54.920
why not use it for making some money some how.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:58.000
Some sort of a business they start.

00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.720
Don't do any business with Sahaja Yoga or Sahaja Yogis,

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:06.600
I've told a hundred times, if you do it you'll be in trouble

00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:09.840
and then don't come and tell me the trouble.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:15.800
Sahaja Yoga is only God' s business, that's all.

00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:24.240
Everything that you are doing is for God and

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:28.080
that's why you are doing it for your self.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:32.040
So introspection is very important,

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.760
criticising others should be less and criticising yourself

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.960
and laughing at yourself is the best.

00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.960
I laugh at myself many a times

00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.040
and say many things like that, if you have noticed,

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.600
that makes life so interesting.

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.080
That will kill your ego.

00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:56.680
How I am trying to assert myself

00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:00.960
and where is the meekness that Christ has talked about.

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:05.640
It is a natural goodness within us.

00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:12.520
Once it shines and shows, you become so beautiful, so loveable.

00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.560
Whether you are sitting here near Me or there

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.080
I know who is that kind.

00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:23.840
My heart just opens for such a personality.

00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:27.120
I know who they are.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:36.160
But even if I know I will never tell you,

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:39.960
it is better that you know yourself.

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:44.880
"Know thyself" is His  message,

00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:47.720
in the real way not with deception

00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:52.040
because you are deceiving yourself, whom are you deceiving,

00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.720
know thyself without any deception,

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:06.880
without any lies, with full concentration.

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:13.080
See where is your attention going, that's how you are going to rise,

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:16.560
you are not going to rise by seeing the defects of others

00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:21.200
but you are going to rise only by seeing your own defects.

00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.400
Exactly this what Christ has said,

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:28.520
I am telling you in very, very simple words.

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:35.040
Then He has said love thy neighbour as thyself which is a very, very

00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:39.200
big thing to say. Now is only possible in Sahaja Yoga

00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:43.680
because you are collective, those who are not collective

00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:47.520
how can they love their neighbour. I mean who is the neighbour then,

00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:51.160
nobody's the neighbour, they're outsiders,

00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:53.920
but as soon as you become collective,

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.720
see today there are fifty five nations, you are all so collective,

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.240
so moral, so beautiful, no complications, nothing,

00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:03.880
I am so overjoyed to see that

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:08.720
but to make it perfect we should introspect.

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:13.200
Socially, collectively you people have improved a lot

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.200
but also individually within yourself

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:20.360
you have to improve for your own goodness.

00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:25.720
So on this great occasion, we have to celebrate

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:31.240
because really such a great amount of work was done by Christ

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:33.880
though neutralised by these horrible priests,

00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:37.800
which is done in every country, in every religion

00:38:37.920 --> 00:38:42.840
but now we should take a vow to save others

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.280
who are taking the name of Christ and doing something

00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:51.680
just the opposite. If it could be done, if it could be achieved

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:55.600
through your lives,  Christ's work has been done.

00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:01.680
You have to now express Christ through your life.

00:39:01.800 --> 00:39:04.240
This is what it is.

00:39:04.360 --> 00:39:09.320
Through your life you can express it, through the purity,

00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:13.160
through the meekness, through the compassion

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:22.320
and the wisdom of Christ. Absolutely fearless was he

00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:25.000
and that's why you have to be fearless

00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:30.880
because you have to be only afraid of God and nobody else,

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:34.560
that's all and if you have done nothing wrong then there's nothing

00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:38.320
to be afraid of God also because He loves you very much.

00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:48.840
So be clear cut about everything, be understanding,

00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:54.560
you are all loveable people no doubt but you should be such

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.320
that you can adore yourself and love yourself

00:39:58.440 --> 00:40:00.840
because of the virtues you have.

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.920
May God Bless you all.
