00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

10
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,892
1984-0708 Public Program 3 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth PP 3

11
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,892
Let’s have our realization now all of us, but I don’t promise as I said it’s your own lookout.

12
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,892
If you believe in our, according to Indian thing if you believe, according to our former karmas

13
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,892
according to our previous things that we get Atma Sakshatkar, because it’s the highest to have.

14
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,892
So let’s see what happens. And also My compassion, My love,

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,892
My desire that you all should get your realisation and establish it

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:40,892
and become powerful Sahaja yogis and understand it fully.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,892
Now those who are here have to follow what I say,

18
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,892
is very simple method by which you help yourself. As I said you are your own guru

19
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,892
and on different chakras we have to work it out and it works.

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,892
So please take out your shoes for one reason, that the Mother Earth helps us

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,892
to sort of earth some of the problems that have come from the Mother Earth.

22
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,892
Now, you have to keep your eyes shut throughout, not to open your eyes.

23
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:25,892
The reasons are many but one of them is that the centre of Agnya,

24
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,892
which is placed between the pituitary and the pineal body, is a very important centre.

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,892
It is the gate and it doesn’t open if your eyes are open outside just now.

26
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,892
So please keep your eyes shut till then and maybe the kundalini may not also rise.

27
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,892
The whole attitude should be that I should get my realization. You’re not going to lose anything,

28
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,892
I don’t take any money, nothing of the kind, and there is nothing to gain out of it anyway.

29
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,892
So just you have to gain something out of it so, in a humble way,

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,892
you have to sit down and put your hands on your lap.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,892
Those people who have come for the first time, or are standing there, can come forward here

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,892
and sit down and the Sahaja yogis should give them places.

33
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:27,892
Sahaja yogis should never take the first places, I would request, it would be a good idea.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:44,892


35
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:54,892
All right, just try to sit on the side if possible, those who have come for the first time.

36
00:02:55,000 --> 00:04:16,892
[ASIDE ABOUT A PARKED CAR]

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,892
Now, as I told you, you don’t have to do anything. It’s an effortless thing that happens,

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:27,892
it’s a happening, and the kundalini rises by itself.

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,892
Only put both your feet straight on the Mother Earth. Straight, as far as possible,

40
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,892
straight touching the Mother Earth. But those who are sitting on the ground are all right,

41
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:52,892
they can sit with [HINDI], on the ground is all right. [HINDI]

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:05:06,892
Now put your both the hands towards Me, as I told you, and close your eyes.

43
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,892
We have to have a proper attitude towards ourselves.

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,892
Firstly, it’s going to be the happiest thing that is going to happen to us,

45
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,892
and the highest thing that we have been asking for ages.

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,892
So we are not to be in any way under any tension about it, it’s really happening to all of us.

47
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:32,892
Sit with a very cheerful mind, not frivolous but cheerful mind.

48
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,892
And secondly you have to respect yourself.

49
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,892
If there is any guilt or anything in your mind, it won’t work out, as I told you.

50
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,892
You must know you’re saints, born to get self-realization.

51
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,892
You are, as described by William Blake, you are men of God, who have to become prophets,

52
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,892
who will have powers to make others prophets.

53
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,892
So, that is the attitude we should have towards ourselves, that’s how you are here today.

54
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:06,892
Please do not condemn yourself, do not have any guilt about yourself, nothing of the kind.

55
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,892
Just believe in yourself, that you are the Spirit.

56
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:22,892
Now, you have to keep both the hands on your lap (you can keep your purse down, lady, you can keep it, it’s all right).

57
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:28,892
Now put your both the hands towards Me, close your eyes fully.

58
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:34,892
Some of you must have already started feeling a little cool breeze in your hands.

59
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:44,892
Put both the hands like this, open upwards, just as like you do for [INAUDIBLE] or something.

60
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,892


61
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:57,892
The left side, as I told you the other day, is for your desire, and the right side is for action.

62
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:04,892
So we are going to put the left hand, all the time, as it is, desiring to be one with the Divine.

63
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:18,892
And the right hand we are going to use for the action of removing the obstacles in our centres.

64
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:26,892
So, first put the right hand on the heart, just on the heart, on the left hand side.

65
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:38,892
Here resides the Spirit in human beings, so, now you ask Me a question without opening your eyes.

66
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:45,892
You can call Me Mataji or Mother, as you like, whichever way you want to call Me.

67
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,892
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

68
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,892
Ask the question thrice, you have a right to ask Me that question.

69
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:15,892


70
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:22,892
Now this right hand has to be taken down on the stomach, on the left hand side, on the upper part of the stomach.

71
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:33,892
This is the centre of your mastery, or what we call the guru centre, it is on the left hand side of your stomach.

72
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,892
On the left hand side you put this right hand. Put the left hand towards Me as it is.

73
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:50,892
Now, here you ask a question, because you, as a spirit, has to be your own master, has to be your own Guru.

74
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:57,892
So you ask Me a question thrice again, “Mother, am I my own Guru?” ask Me.

75
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,892
With full confidence, “Am I my own master?”

76
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:23,892
On the higher part of the stomach, please put your right hand on the higher part of the stomach.

77
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:34,892
Now, put this right hand on the left hand side of your stomach, in the lower region.

78
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:39,892
There’s a centre there, in the lower region of your stomach, lower region of your stomach.

79
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,892
On the left hand side, keeping the left hand towards Me.

80
00:09:44,000 --> 00:10:01,892
Now, this is the centre where is the knowledge of the working of your kundalini.

81
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:08,892
In this centre, called as Shuddha Vidya, meaning the pure knowledge.

82
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,892
As this point, I’m sorry but you have to ask for it, I cannot force anyone into it,

83
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,892
like you cannot force a student to accept any knowledge.

84
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:35,892
In the same way you have to say “Mother, give me that pure knowledge” or you can say “Mother, please give me that Shuddha Vidya”,

85
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,892
you have to ask six times, because this centre has got six sub plexuses.

86
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:51,892
So you have to ask six times, in a very humble way, “Mother, please give me that Shuddha Vidya”.

87
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,892
That is the first asking.

88
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:12,892
See this prayer, this is such a pure prayer. Give me the Shuddha Vidya, give me the pure knowledge of the Divine, the working of the Divine.

89
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:30,892
Now, as you have entered into that realm of asking Me for the pure knowledge, the first thing you have to assume, is that [END OF TAPE].

90
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,000
