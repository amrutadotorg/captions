00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.146
Guru Puja, July 12th, 1998
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:14.792
Today, we have assembled here to do the Guru Puja.

00:00:16.102 --> 00:00:23.893
The word "guru" comes from

00:00:24.094 --> 00:00:29.995
"the one which is magnetic,

00:00:30.196 --> 00:00:33.690
the person who is magnetic";

00:00:33.891 --> 00:00:42.150
the one which attracts the attention of the seekers

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:47.643
is the guru. Also it means

00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:52.995
the heaviness, or you can say,

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:59.378
a person who is very steady,

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:07.825
who is very deep, who has the knowledge,

00:01:08.026 --> 00:01:14.973
and who can act like the Mother Earth.

00:01:15.174 --> 00:01:22.839
For the power of magnetism in the Mother Earth

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.519
also is called as magnetic,

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.964
but in Sanskrit is "Gurutwa karshan,"

00:01:31.165 --> 00:01:36.284
means "the attraction

00:01:36.485 --> 00:01:41.503
of the heaviness of the Mother Earth."

00:01:41.704 --> 00:01:46.995
But actually it is

00:01:47.196 --> 00:01:53.714
a power of the Mother Earth that makes us stand

00:01:53.915 --> 00:02:00.316
properly on our legs when it is rotating

00:02:00.517 --> 00:02:02.839
with such a tremendous speed,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:08.269
otherwise we would be all thrown away.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.714
With that velocity that She is moving,

00:02:11.915 --> 00:02:22.975
we are still attached or we are one in our balance,

00:02:23.176 --> 00:02:28.639
is only because She has gravity.

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.498
This gravity has to be in a guru.

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:41.717
Gravity means

00:02:41.918 --> 00:02:51.562
a kind of a serious understanding of oneself

00:02:51.763 --> 00:02:57.226
and one's own responsibilities.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:02.507
So a guru has to be very steady.

00:03:02.708 --> 00:03:11.535
In these modern times, people are very mobile,

00:03:11.736 --> 00:03:16.141
all the time agitated,

00:03:16.342 --> 00:03:19.954
all the time getting disturbed.

00:03:20.155 --> 00:03:24.532
With small things happening here and there, they get disturbed.

00:03:24.733 --> 00:03:29.977
They meet people who are not of any quality,

00:03:30.178 --> 00:03:32.610
then they get disturbed.

00:03:32.811 --> 00:03:36.665
These disturbing qualities

00:03:36.866 --> 00:03:43.142
come from our deficiency in our gravity.

00:03:43.343 --> 00:03:47.626
A person who has gravity doesn't get depressed,

00:03:47.827 --> 00:03:50.774
neither get excited,

00:03:50.975 --> 00:03:54.274
nor get overly enthusiastic,

00:03:54.475 --> 00:03:59.196
nor is he very sad or unhappy.

00:03:59.397 --> 00:04:02.516
So he's in the center,

00:04:02.717 --> 00:04:06.891
he's in the center of his being.

00:04:07.092 --> 00:04:11.649
But how do we become the guru?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.126
That is very important for Sahaja Yogis to understand.

00:04:16.327 --> 00:04:19.431
Many have felt that they are gurus,

00:04:19.632 --> 00:04:23.251
they have tried to behave in a funny manner,

00:04:23.452 --> 00:04:27.423
and have lost their guru position.

00:04:27.624 --> 00:04:31.131
First and foremost thing for Sahaja Yogis,

00:04:31.332 --> 00:04:36.928
it is important that they must have introspection,

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.194
they must watch themselves.

00:04:40.395 --> 00:04:45.702
If a person runs about

00:04:45.903 --> 00:04:49.639
changing because a fashion has come,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.780
because people have suppressed them, or have asked them;

00:04:54.981 --> 00:05:01.139
just to please people of cheap values,

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:08.910
if a person changes, then he cannot be a guru.

00:05:09.724 --> 00:05:13.027
He has to station himself

00:05:13.228 --> 00:05:18.566
properly on the values of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:22.785
Without introspection you will not know,

00:05:22.986 --> 00:05:27.152
you will never remember what you have done wrong,

00:05:27.353 --> 00:05:33.699
nor will you think of what you have to do right.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:41.556
But that is only possible if you go on improving yourself.

00:05:41.917 --> 00:05:44.364
First and foremost thing is,

00:05:44.565 --> 00:05:48.825
all the great saints have praised their guru.

00:05:49.026 --> 00:05:54.552
For example, we have a very great saint,

00:05:54.753 --> 00:05:57.802
Gyaneshwara, in India.

00:05:58.003 --> 00:06:01.536
He's written a complete chapter about the guru.

00:06:01.737 --> 00:06:05.606
In English they have translated it as "preceptor" -

00:06:05.807 --> 00:06:08.200
guru is the preceptor -

00:06:08.401 --> 00:06:11.856
and what he has done is a great thing.

00:06:12.057 --> 00:06:15.934
He says you are not to challenge the guru,

00:06:16.135 --> 00:06:19.403
otherwise you can never become a guru;

00:06:19.604 --> 00:06:23.028
for name's sake you might be, but you are not.

00:06:23.229 --> 00:06:27.184
Secondly, you can never misbehave.

00:06:27.385 --> 00:06:30.997
You can never be rude, arrogant,

00:06:31.198 --> 00:06:35.895
and you cannot show your temper to a guru.

00:06:36.096 --> 00:06:39.744
If that is so, that means you are not a guru,

00:06:39.945 --> 00:06:48.280
you are still on a very low level personality.

00:06:48.531 --> 00:06:51.260
It is very clearly said

00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:58.098
that if you try to say against other gurus

00:06:58.299 --> 00:07:02.239
who are real gurus, who are very high caliber,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:07.934
that also, then you are not a guru.

00:07:08.142 --> 00:07:13.231
But I would say that you all have got now vibrations,

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:17.036
you all have got vibratory awareness.

00:07:17.237 --> 00:07:19.841
When you have vibratory awareness,

00:07:20.042 --> 00:07:24.739
you are capable of finding out about everyone.

00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.372
Now you need not talk about

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:31.169
your own understanding of a person,

00:07:31.370 --> 00:07:35.224
but try to face that person directly,

00:07:35.425 --> 00:07:39.677
and tell that person, "This is the problem,"

00:07:39.878 --> 00:07:42.568
and ask him to change.

00:07:42.769 --> 00:07:47.591
But in Sahaja Yoga we have something more than other gurus had.

00:07:47.792 --> 00:07:50.654
Other gurus were very, very strict.

00:07:50.855 --> 00:07:54.763
They used to carry a stick in their hand, a big stick

00:07:54.964 --> 00:08:00.654
which they would use for walking or for hitting their disciples.

00:08:00.855 --> 00:08:06.450
They used to hit their disciples in such a bad manner

00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:14.751
that the disciple was literally frightened of the guru.

00:08:14.952 --> 00:08:20.998
I'll give you an example of a guru I came across.

00:08:21.199 --> 00:08:27.045
One fellow was there in India

00:08:27.246 --> 00:08:32.779
who came to one of the ladies who was a Sahaja Yogini,

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:39.881
and he said that "My guru has sent me word

00:08:40.082 --> 00:08:45.529
that Adi Shakti's going to come and stay with you. Is it true?"

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:49.248
She said, "Yes, She's going to stay with me. So what?"

00:08:49.449 --> 00:08:52.936
He said, "My guru has told me

00:08:53.137 --> 00:08:55.889
that 'You go and request Her,

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.858
and if She could come to our ashram.'"

00:09:00.059 --> 00:09:03.131
She said, "I'll ask Mataji, I don't know."

00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:13.517
This fellow came to a program and he saw Me, a housewife.

00:09:13.718 --> 00:09:16.962
He said, "This cannot be that Guru."

00:09:17.163 --> 00:09:23.775
But when I came in, he saw, and when I did Self Realization,

00:09:23.976 --> 00:09:27.814
that everybody's Kundalini was awakened, he was so surprised

00:09:28.015 --> 00:09:32.712
and he prostrated himself before Me.

00:09:32.913 --> 00:09:36.055
Now, his guru was living in Amarnath,

00:09:36.256 --> 00:09:46.390
is a very famous religious place in the Himalayas.

00:09:46.591 --> 00:09:50.937
And this fellow lived in a place called Ambarnath.

00:09:51.138 --> 00:09:57.675
So he asked Me, "Mother, will You come to my ashram?"

00:09:57.876 --> 00:10:02.433
I said, "Why not?" Because these gurus in the ancient time

00:10:02.634 --> 00:10:06.121
never used to leave their seat, they call takia -

00:10:06.322 --> 00:10:10.660
means "the pillow" - they never left their takia.

00:10:10.861 --> 00:10:13.183
I said, "All right, I don't mind. I'll come to you,

00:10:13.384 --> 00:10:15.348
to your ashram."

00:10:15.549 --> 00:10:18.575
So he's just keeping quiet all the while.

00:10:18.776 --> 00:10:22.644
So I went there, this guru fell at My Feet,

00:10:22.845 --> 00:10:26.097
and he was very, very respectful;

00:10:26.298 --> 00:10:32.628
and then we came back home.

00:10:32.829 --> 00:10:36.058
So this fellow started telling Me, "If You don't tell my guru,

00:10:36.259 --> 00:10:41.253
I would like to tell You that I have got a very bad Agnya.

00:10:41.454 --> 00:10:44.714
Can You cure, Mother?" I said, "Why not? I will."

00:10:44.915 --> 00:10:47.831
So I went back to this guru again, and I said,

00:10:48.032 --> 00:10:51.581
"Why didn't you cure his Agnya?"

00:10:51.782 --> 00:10:55.472
He said, "Why? Why should I cure? Who cured my Agnya?

00:10:55.673 --> 00:11:00.058
I worked out myself. I had to introspect, find out,

00:11:00.259 --> 00:11:04.152
and I cured my own Agnya, and why should I cure his Agnya?

00:11:04.353 --> 00:11:09.871
Let him plod, let him work, let him get to this.

00:11:10.072 --> 00:11:16.457
Otherwise he will be a spoilt man."

00:11:16.658 --> 00:11:19.902
I was quite surprised. And he said,

00:11:20.103 --> 00:11:24.246
"You do it because You are a Mother. You are nothing but love,

00:11:24.447 --> 00:11:29.269
and that's why You are doing it, all this, for others.

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:37.627
But not me! No guru will open the Agnya of his disciples."

00:11:37.828 --> 00:11:40.065
I said, "Then why are you a guru?"

00:11:40.266 --> 00:11:45.836
He said, "Because we have to guide them.

00:12:02.127 --> 00:12:07.864
And if they have their Agnya badly cut out,

00:12:08.065 --> 00:12:14.153
if their attention is not all right, I'm not bothered about it.

00:12:14.354 --> 00:12:18.231
It is their duty to introspect and find,

00:12:18.432 --> 00:12:21.629
and climb the ladder which I've put before them.

00:12:21.830 --> 00:12:26.465
So I'm a guru, I can only give them the ladder to climb up.

00:12:26.666 --> 00:12:29.434
It is they who should work very hard,

00:12:29.635 --> 00:12:32.340
it is they who should introspect,

00:12:32.541 --> 00:12:35.129
it is they who should correct themselves.

00:12:35.330 --> 00:12:39.012
Why should I help them to such an extent

00:12:39.213 --> 00:12:42.340
that you open their Agnya?"

00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:45.142
I said, "All right, you allow Me to open his Agnya,

00:12:45.343 --> 00:12:46.343
if you don't mind."

00:12:46.544 --> 00:12:48.673
He said, "You are a Mother, do what You like;

00:12:48.874 --> 00:12:52.415
I have nothing to say. If You want to do that,

00:12:52.616 --> 00:12:56.696
You'll spoil him, You'll spoil him.

00:12:56.897 --> 00:12:59.329
Let him do it on his own,

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:02.095
otherwise You'll be spoiling him."

00:13:02.296 --> 00:13:04.236
I said, "As you are also spoiling,

00:13:04.437 --> 00:13:07.564
that you don't open anybody's Agnyas, yes?"

00:13:07.765 --> 00:13:12.806
"But whatever position I've achieved is a permanent one."

00:13:13.007 --> 00:13:15.994
So I opened his Agnya.

00:13:16.195 --> 00:13:20.728
Then this fellow, on his way he told Me that

00:13:20.929 --> 00:13:26.205
his guru came back "and he put me hanging on a well.

00:13:26.406 --> 00:13:29.244
And he used to every time lower the rope

00:13:29.445 --> 00:13:34.994
so I would go into the water. Ten times he did it."

00:13:35.195 --> 00:13:38.064
But I said, "Why did he do such a cruel thing?"

00:13:38.265 --> 00:13:41.166
He said, "Because he found me smoking a cigarette."

00:13:41.367 --> 00:13:43.994
My goodness!

00:13:44.211 --> 00:13:45.780
So I asked his guru, I said,

00:13:45.981 --> 00:13:49.303
"Why do you do such horrible things to your disciples?"

00:13:49.504 --> 00:13:53.326
He said, "Otherwise, if you don't do like that

00:13:53.527 --> 00:13:56.662
they will never rise, they'll never come up.

00:13:56.863 --> 00:14:00.053
You go on forgiving them and the more you forgive,

00:14:00.254 --> 00:14:04.592
the worse they become, and they will show no ascent at all.

00:14:04.793 --> 00:14:07.365
So you have to be very strict with them.

00:14:07.566 --> 00:14:11.381
Please don't spoil them all the time."

00:14:11.582 --> 00:14:14.819
I was really surprised. How could he say so?

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:20.225
"You see," he said, "Mother, if you give everything free,

00:14:20.426 --> 00:14:23.272
you give them everything so easily,

00:14:23.473 --> 00:14:26.491
they will never value their self-respect,

00:14:26.692 --> 00:14:30.350
they will never value their Self Realization."

00:14:30.551 --> 00:14:34.741
I said, "It's not so. You have to give them a chance.

00:14:34.942 --> 00:14:38.608
You have to allow them to rise,

00:14:38.809 --> 00:14:43.975
and to allow them to become something.

00:14:44.176 --> 00:14:47.332
Like Mother Earth, what She does,

00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:52.319
She sprouts the seeds, then the trees come up.

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:55.884
Then after that She gives them the fruits,

00:14:56.085 --> 00:15:00.993
and She sees that the fruits are ripened; all does She do."

00:15:01.194 --> 00:15:08.016
But he said, "But they are not trees, You see, they're human beings,

00:15:08.217 --> 00:15:12.625
and they have freedom to become devils also."

00:15:12.826 --> 00:15:16.945
I said, "All right, if there are devils, I can manage them.

00:15:17.146 --> 00:15:20.742
You just see how I can manage them. And if they are devils

00:15:20.943 --> 00:15:24.890
they will remain devils, you cannot change them."

00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.281
So he argued with Me,

00:15:27.482 --> 00:15:29.750
and when he met Sahaja Yogis he asked them,

00:15:29.951 --> 00:15:34.289
"How many of you are willing to give life for Shri Mataji?

00:15:34.490 --> 00:15:39.234
Do you know what She has given you?" They said, "Yes, we do."

00:15:39.435 --> 00:15:42.257
So they came to Me and told, "Mother,

00:15:42.458 --> 00:15:46.171
he wanted us to give life for You." I said,

00:15:46.372 --> 00:15:50.265
"There's no necessity, it's not necessary;

00:15:50.466 --> 00:15:53.890
because he used to ask his disciples, perhaps."

00:15:54.091 --> 00:15:59.538
And then I met many like him who were very strict gurus,

00:15:59.739 --> 00:16:03.585
complete obedience was needed; complete humility,

00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:05.702
complete surrender was needed.

00:16:05.903 --> 00:16:08.679
A word against the guru was not tolerated,

00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.046
but even you could not answer,

00:16:11.247 --> 00:16:15.554
you could not show any temper to a guru.

00:16:15.755 --> 00:16:19.648
Now I have met people who are like that sometimes,

00:16:19.849 --> 00:16:22.961
then I stopped talking to them, that's it.

00:16:23.162 --> 00:16:24.734
If they want to improve, they can improve;

00:16:24.935 --> 00:16:28.797
they don't want to improve, you cannot force them to improve.

00:16:28.998 --> 00:16:31.242
But according to these gurus,

00:16:31.443 --> 00:16:32.443
there should be a great fear in their mind,

00:16:34.474 --> 00:16:36.929
that they should be so frightened

00:16:37.130 --> 00:16:42.434
that they should behave themselves.

00:16:43.091 --> 00:16:46.476
Now we expect so much from the guru,

00:16:46.677 --> 00:16:50.820
that he's your father, mother,

00:16:51.021 --> 00:16:54.883
he's a friend, everything to you.

00:16:55.084 --> 00:17:00.266
He is a pure person who just wants your ascent.

00:17:00.467 --> 00:17:03.782
He wants to look after you,

00:17:03.983 --> 00:17:08.376
he wants to guide you, wants to protect you,

00:17:08.577 --> 00:17:13.259
and takes you to the life of spirituality;

00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:17.134
and this is the way a guru has to work out.

00:17:17.335 --> 00:17:22.532
But what is expected of the disciples is even much worse.

00:17:22.733 --> 00:17:30.387
The disciple has to be absolutely a pure person,

00:17:30.588 --> 00:17:37.481
he should have a pure desire to become a spiritual person.

00:17:37.682 --> 00:17:40.254
If he doesn't have this pure desire,

00:17:40.455 --> 00:17:45.590
he has some other desires, then absolutely useless.

00:17:45.791 --> 00:17:49.082
Like some people come to Sahaja Yoga, I've seen it,

00:17:49.283 --> 00:17:51.957
they want to make a name out of themselves,

00:17:52.158 --> 00:17:55.238
they become great masters of everything,

00:17:55.439 --> 00:17:57.801
they want to dominate everything.

00:17:58.002 --> 00:18:02.418
That is not, that is not important.

00:18:02.619 --> 00:18:05.481
There are some people who try to make money in Sahaja Yoga:

00:18:05.682 --> 00:18:08.262
a way of making money.

00:18:08.463 --> 00:18:11.692
That also absolutely wrong; and not only that,

00:18:11.893 --> 00:18:13.801
but it's very low level,

00:18:14.002 --> 00:18:17.278
that you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:17.479 --> 00:18:21.575
Then there are people who just come here for some politics.

00:18:21.776 --> 00:18:25.208
They go on saying things here and saying things there.

00:18:25.409 --> 00:18:30.216
All these things are not going to give you any ascent whatsoever.

00:18:30.417 --> 00:18:35.482
You have come here only to achieve a

00:18:35.683 --> 00:18:41.318
great life of spirituality, of becoming a guru.

00:18:41.519 --> 00:18:44.763
Now also this politics business is quite a lot,

00:18:44.964 --> 00:18:51.029
people try to enjoy the position of a leader,

00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:56.951
so they try to keep that position in a very special way.

00:18:57.152 --> 00:18:58.670
There's no need.

00:18:58.871 --> 00:19:05.068
If you are a leader because you are a great master,

00:19:05.269 --> 00:19:08.623
you will remain. Nobody can challenge you,

00:19:08.824 --> 00:19:12.122
nobody can dethrone you, and one should not get disturbed

00:19:12.323 --> 00:19:14.567
with any such fear.

00:19:14.768 --> 00:19:20.848
Sahaja Yoga is a yoga in which fear doesn't play any part;

00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:23.075
there's no fear, for you.

00:19:23.276 --> 00:19:28.989
Only thing for your ascent, it is necessary that you introspect.

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.692
Try to find out, what have you been doing?

00:19:32.893 --> 00:19:39.292
Are you an, absolutely a humble person?

00:19:39.870 --> 00:19:42.903
Do you do whatever is told to you?

00:19:43.104 --> 00:19:51.419
Supposing I tell somebody just go to, say, some place,

00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:53.919
he may not go. He'll come and tell Me,

00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:56.052
"Mother, You know, this happened, that happened" -

00:19:56.253 --> 00:19:59.513
some excuse, he may not go.

00:19:59.714 --> 00:20:02.216
But that's not being good.

00:20:02.417 --> 00:20:04.721
If you have been told to go to that place,

00:20:04.922 --> 00:20:08.299
there must be some meaning and you have to go.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.643
You have to obey. If you are not obedient

00:20:11.844 --> 00:20:17.065
then you cannot become a guru, because if you cannot obey,

00:20:17.266 --> 00:20:20.534
how can others obey you?

00:20:20.735 --> 00:20:24.159
This obedience is not for any personal gain of the guru,

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:27.050
not at all, but for your gain only,

00:20:27.251 --> 00:20:30.792
for your education, for your ascent.

00:20:30.993 --> 00:20:35.925
So if such a view is taken then what happens,

00:20:36.126 --> 00:20:42.089
that you start getting all the qualities of a guru.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:45.566
Firstly, a guru cannot be fussy man,

00:20:45.767 --> 00:20:47.214
first and foremost thing.

00:20:47.415 --> 00:20:49.987
"I want this house, I want that thing;

00:20:50.188 --> 00:20:54.198
I can't like this, I can't like that."

00:20:54.399 --> 00:20:57.846
If a person who does not know

00:20:58.047 --> 00:21:01.557
how to get detached from all these habits,

00:21:01.758 --> 00:21:05.534
he cannot be a guru. How can he ascend?

00:21:05.735 --> 00:21:09.768
Of course, I mean, you have to try

00:21:09.969 --> 00:21:12.416
that you get rid of all these habits.

00:21:12.617 --> 00:21:16.104
They are funny habits which make you miserable;

00:21:16.305 --> 00:21:20.526
doesn't make miserable others, as it makes you miserable.

00:21:20.727 --> 00:21:25.323
No habit should cling to a guru.

00:21:25.524 --> 00:21:32.495
First and foremost is that he has to be beyond time.

00:21:32.696 --> 00:21:36.979
He should not worry about time.

00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:39.831
Many-a-times I have seen people,

00:21:40.032 --> 00:21:44.300
if they have to go to a airport, for example,

00:21:44.501 --> 00:21:46.159
something enters into their body,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.948
they become speedy suddenly, everybody.

00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:52.854
Even if I have to go, I'm going,

00:21:53.055 --> 00:21:55.385
then all of them will become speedy,

00:21:55.586 --> 00:21:58.471
everybody starts running helter-skelter. Why?

00:21:58.672 --> 00:22:03.549
I am going, you are not going; but it happens.

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:07.205
Like that, if you tell somebody you have to go to a function

00:22:07.406 --> 00:22:11.947
or for some felicitation, people start jumping about,

00:22:12.148 --> 00:22:16.299
and that's a very modern disease, it was not before.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.369
So they start seeing that we are getting late, getting upset.

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:27.158
But if you go on worrying like that, you don't go beyond time.

00:22:27.359 --> 00:22:31.267
And when you go beyond time, you control time,

00:22:31.468 --> 00:22:36.783
time is with you all the time. Whenever you go, it happens.

00:22:36.984 --> 00:22:39.447
I'll give an example of that.

00:22:39.648 --> 00:22:44.330
We had a little girl in Cabella who fell down

00:22:44.531 --> 00:22:47.330
and she broke her hand, very badly.

00:22:47.531 --> 00:22:49.972
I was about to leave for America, I was,

00:22:50.173 --> 00:22:52.441
actually I'd come out of My room.

00:22:52.642 --> 00:22:54.202
When I saw the child I said,

00:22:54.403 --> 00:22:59.272
"All right, doesn't matter. I'll cure this child first."

00:22:59.473 --> 00:23:01.147
They said, "No, Mother, but Your plane!"

00:23:01.348 --> 00:23:04.085
I said, "It's all right, forget it."

00:23:04.286 --> 00:23:11.132
So I got the child, treated the child, and she was all right.

00:23:11.333 --> 00:23:18.460
And after, I think, half-an-hour, I left, I left for the airport.

00:23:18.661 --> 00:23:21.038
And you'll be amazed to hear

00:23:21.239 --> 00:23:25.421
that that aeroplane was out of order,

00:23:25.622 --> 00:23:27.226
which was going to New York.

00:23:27.427 --> 00:23:31.015
So there's this plane is out of order. Then they said,

00:23:31.216 --> 00:23:35.242
"All right, You can go by another plane which goes to Washington,

00:23:35.443 --> 00:23:39.281
with the same ticket." I said, "Very good idea, give Me that,"

00:23:39.482 --> 00:23:42.211
and I went by that. So that I reached Washington,

00:23:42.412 --> 00:23:46.688
which is a very, very nice airport to arrive,

00:23:46.889 --> 00:23:50.922
because there's no problem of customs,

00:23:51.123 --> 00:23:53.195
there's no crowd, nothing.

00:23:53.396 --> 00:23:56.273
All people go to New York, I don't know why.

00:23:56.474 --> 00:23:59.789
They should all go to Washington, it's very surprising.

00:23:59.990 --> 00:24:04.969
I discovered for Myself, that I wished I had not gone

00:24:05.170 --> 00:24:09.633
by that horrible plane to go to New York.

00:24:09.834 --> 00:24:12.946
Like that everything works out.

00:24:13.147 --> 00:24:18.844
And the time comes what is good for you.

00:24:19.045 --> 00:24:23.532
It is such a lot of experience of Mine which I can tell you,

00:24:23.733 --> 00:24:28.618
that to worry about time itself is a headache.

00:24:28.819 --> 00:24:33.696
If you leave it to this divine power and believe in it,

00:24:33.897 --> 00:24:37.696
then everything works out for your good.

00:24:37.897 --> 00:24:46.605
And if it does not, you must know that it is your destiny,

00:24:46.806 --> 00:24:50.847
you must accept, you must learn to accept.

00:24:51.048 --> 00:24:53.300
Because whatever you have fixed up yourself

00:24:53.501 --> 00:24:57.425
as something very great, is not.

00:24:57.626 --> 00:25:00.909
So what is the greatest thing you have to achieve? -

00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:03.307
your detachment.

00:25:03.508 --> 00:25:05.979
Then you become gunateet:

00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:10.135
means, as you know, we have three gunas within us.

00:25:10.336 --> 00:25:17.818
One is, they call is as sattwa guna, is the best.

00:25:18.131 --> 00:25:22.235
But there are two other gunas which are, as you know,

00:25:22.436 --> 00:25:25.485
the left side and right side.

00:25:25.686 --> 00:25:29.993
Either you are a right-sided person or a left-sided person.

00:25:30.194 --> 00:25:37.290
These two gunas within us are of no importance.

00:25:37.491 --> 00:25:40.267
Supposing you are a right-sided person,

00:25:40.468 --> 00:25:45.665
then what happens to you? You become over-active.

00:25:45.866 --> 00:25:48.368
Over- activity gives you fatigue,

00:25:48.569 --> 00:25:51.876
gives you all kinds of diseases which you have seen,

00:25:52.077 --> 00:25:54.439
and you have to cure right side.

00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.244
Such a person is extremely speedy,

00:25:57.445 --> 00:26:00.135
he cannot sit in one place for two minutes,

00:26:00.336 --> 00:26:02.768
all the time jumping,

00:26:02.969 --> 00:26:07.432
and he creates problems for himself and his family.

00:26:07.633 --> 00:26:12.424
Then the left-sided person,

00:26:12.625 --> 00:26:16.104
which we call as the tamo guna -

00:26:16.305 --> 00:26:18.707
the right-sided is rajo guna, and the left-sided

00:26:18.908 --> 00:26:24.605
is the one which is tamo guna -

00:26:24.806 --> 00:26:30.355
"tamo" means darkness, such a man is afraid of darkness,

00:26:30.556 --> 00:26:33.722
darkness, everything he is afraid of.

00:26:33.923 --> 00:26:41.869
But he becomes a very intriguingly, very crooked person.

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:46.924
He always tries to trouble people in a very crooked manner,

00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:51.932
not openly, while the right-sided man is openly a Hitler.

00:26:52.133 --> 00:26:56.799
But this one, the second one, the one who is called as tamo guni,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.690
is the one tries to trouble others very much.

00:27:01.891 --> 00:27:06.948
Rajo guni has a opinion of his own about everything.

00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:10.464
When he is so much having his own opinion,

00:27:10.665 --> 00:27:14.175
he goes on forcing it on to other persons.

00:27:14.376 --> 00:27:18.667
But if you see his own life, he is in complete misery.

00:27:18.868 --> 00:27:23.034
He cannot carry on with people, he cannot talk to people,

00:27:23.235 --> 00:27:27.651
and there's a very big gap between himself,

00:27:27.852 --> 00:27:31.034
his Spirit and his being.

00:27:31.235 --> 00:27:34.206
The second type, the tamo gunis, are the ones

00:27:34.407 --> 00:27:37.558
who end up with all kinds of diseases.

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:41.300
Even the right-sided people get lots of diseases.

00:27:41.501 --> 00:27:45.144
But the left ones get it psychosomatic.

00:27:45.345 --> 00:27:48.527
Psychosomatic diseases are very dangerous

00:27:48.728 --> 00:27:52.183
and not curable by human doctors.

00:27:52.384 --> 00:27:54.433
So you have to take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:54.634 --> 00:27:57.081
But again you go to the right or to the left,

00:27:57.282 --> 00:28:03.097
again right, to the left. This is not a very good attitude,

00:28:03.298 --> 00:28:08.769
I think, towards life that you get bound by one of these gunas,

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:11.913
or you are all the time like a pendulum

00:28:12.114 --> 00:28:14.913
moving from left to right, right to left.

00:28:15.114 --> 00:28:17.835
So you have to be a steady person.

00:28:18.036 --> 00:28:21.780
For that, you all have to meditate.

00:28:21.981 --> 00:28:24.343
I know immediately a person who meditates,

00:28:24.544 --> 00:28:27.632
and I know who does not meditate.

00:28:27.833 --> 00:28:30.827
You will yourself know a person who meditates.

00:28:31.028 --> 00:28:33.975
It's a question of ten, fifteen minutes,

00:28:34.176 --> 00:28:37.280
but that you must do every night and morning,

00:28:37.481 --> 00:28:42.639
about five minutes' meditation; then you develop your balance,

00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:48.981
you develop your tenacity, you develop your own body

00:28:49.182 --> 00:28:53.192
in such a manner that it can stand lots of nonsense,

00:28:53.393 --> 00:28:58.450
it can bear lots of things. You don't have then desires left -

00:28:58.651 --> 00:29:02.763
what food you should eat, when you should eat,

00:29:02.964 --> 00:29:06.708
whom you should please - nothing of the kind.

00:29:06.909 --> 00:29:09.864
You yourself become such a sweet person

00:29:10.065 --> 00:29:14.223
that everybody is pleased, and understand that

00:29:14.424 --> 00:29:20.043
one has to be like you.

00:29:20.244 --> 00:29:23.527
The people see you and you become like a model.

00:29:23.728 --> 00:29:28.105
People start following you, that means you become a guru.

00:29:28.306 --> 00:29:32.574
In this way you get rid of these two habits that you have,

00:29:32.775 --> 00:29:36.590
of left and right side. Now sattwa gunis are the people

00:29:36.791 --> 00:29:42.434
who believe in the righteousness, but when they are righteous,

00:29:42.635 --> 00:29:46.661
they have contempt for others who are not righteous.

00:29:46.862 --> 00:29:49.388
They go on saying things to such people,

00:29:49.589 --> 00:29:52.716
so they can develop a kind of a temperament

00:29:52.917 --> 00:29:56.802
so they become aloof. They can go to Himalayas,

00:29:57.003 --> 00:30:01.333
sit there and not to meet anybody; get out of the society,

00:30:01.534 --> 00:30:04.005
get out of all your relations, everyone,

00:30:04.206 --> 00:30:10.794
and just establish yourself as a big guru somewhere.

00:30:10.995 --> 00:30:14.185
This kind of also another generation is there,

00:30:14.386 --> 00:30:20.240
which is of no use. I met some of them when I was in Hardwar.

00:30:20.441 --> 00:30:23.513
And I told them, "What are you doing here in the Himalayas?"

00:30:23.714 --> 00:30:25.833
They said, "We don't want to face human beings.

00:30:26.034 --> 00:30:28.810
They're useless people, they're good for nothing.

00:30:29.011 --> 00:30:32.069
You do anything for them, they go on troubling you.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:35.717
We don't want to be there." So I said, "Why have you become guru?

00:30:35.918 --> 00:30:40.623
If you cannot manage them, if you cannot

00:30:40.824 --> 00:30:43.365
get out of the troubles they are giving you

00:30:43.566 --> 00:30:47.451
and out of all those things, and remain in your peace,

00:30:47.652 --> 00:30:49.857
then what's the use of becoming this?"

00:30:50.058 --> 00:30:51.919
He said, "We have had enough of it."

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.669
Some of them were over hundred years of age and all that,

00:30:55.870 --> 00:30:58.860
but I said, "What's the use? Your life is of no use,

00:30:59.061 --> 00:31:02.212
you are staying here alone somewhere in the jungles."

00:31:02.413 --> 00:31:06.728
He said, "The tigers, the snakes, all of them know us,

00:31:06.929 --> 00:31:09.603
that we are great; they don't trouble us.

00:31:09.804 --> 00:31:12.025
But these human beings are troubling.

00:31:12.226 --> 00:31:16.072
If we go down, they'll trouble us and torture us.

00:31:16.273 --> 00:31:19.681
We don't want to go there because they're very ambitious,

00:31:19.882 --> 00:31:23.204
or they are very negative.

00:31:23.405 --> 00:31:25.509
Something is wrong with the human beings,

00:31:25.710 --> 00:31:29.157
none of them have reached a perfect state."

00:31:29.358 --> 00:31:31.508
So that all that, I was surprised

00:31:31.709 --> 00:31:36.430
how they are not at all willing to come down and be with us,

00:31:36.631 --> 00:31:39.836
and be a part and parcel of us.

00:31:40.037 --> 00:31:43.578
So they said, "All right, Mother, You have come. You are a Mother,

00:31:43.779 --> 00:31:47.672
You can tolerate all this and You can work it out, but not me.

00:31:47.873 --> 00:31:50.516
We are out of it, we don't want to go back."

00:31:50.717 --> 00:31:54.157
They have lots of powers. They can control the nature,

00:31:54.358 --> 00:31:56.450
they can do so many things. But they said,

00:31:56.651 --> 00:32:01.665
"Easy to control even a snake than to control a human being.

00:32:01.866 --> 00:32:04.478
Today they might behave in a particular manner,

00:32:04.679 --> 00:32:06.455
suddenly they will become horrible.

00:32:06.656 --> 00:32:09.674
You don't know these human beings how uncertain they are,

00:32:09.875 --> 00:32:12.018
what uncertain quantity they are."

00:32:12.219 --> 00:32:16.229
I said, "There is a way of putting them right.

00:32:16.430 --> 00:32:20.549
You first give them Realization. In the light of their Spirit

00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:24.033
they can see how they are doing wrong things.

00:32:24.234 --> 00:32:28.830
Ninety-nine percent people will know what's going wrong with them,

00:32:29.031 --> 00:32:31.838
where are they missing the point.

00:32:32.039 --> 00:32:34.479
They will start seeing themselves.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.674
Spirit is like a mirror where you see yourself clearly,

00:32:38.875 --> 00:32:40.901
and you start changing yourself.

00:32:41.102 --> 00:32:44.409
There's no introspection actually needed then,

00:32:44.610 --> 00:32:48.886
when you have your Spirit awakened. You can watch yourself,

00:32:49.087 --> 00:32:52.261
you can see for yourself clearly,

00:32:52.462 --> 00:32:55.300
as soon as

00:32:55.501 --> 00:33:02.613
you become a developed or evolved Sahaja Yogi."

00:33:02.814 --> 00:33:06.504
And that is one point one should see,

00:33:06.705 --> 00:33:09.481
if it has happened to you.

00:33:09.682 --> 00:33:13.129
If you can see something wrong with you,

00:33:13.330 --> 00:33:21.646
if you can find out what sort of defects you have,

00:33:21.847 --> 00:33:26.880
if you can detach yourself from those defects,

00:33:27.081 --> 00:33:29.849
and if you can understand

00:33:30.050 --> 00:33:33.740
that all these attachments and defects and habits

00:33:33.941 --> 00:33:39.342
are pulling you down, then only you can leave them.

00:33:39.543 --> 00:33:41.850
But that only happens when you have

00:33:42.051 --> 00:33:46.405
this mirror of your Self shining through.

00:33:46.606 --> 00:33:50.374
When this light comes to you, you see for yourself

00:33:50.575 --> 00:33:54.062
what is wrong with you,

00:33:54.263 --> 00:33:56.609
what is the wrong path you are taking.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:34:01.109
Overnight you have seen people have given up so many things.

00:34:01.310 --> 00:34:05.317
Many gross things they give up, but still there are many,

00:34:05.518 --> 00:34:09.208
I should say, subtle things, which stick on to them.

00:34:09.409 --> 00:34:13.599
First thing that happens to you is that you start finding

00:34:13.800 --> 00:34:21.589
what's wrong with your own people of your own nation.

00:34:21.878 --> 00:34:25.638
I'm amazed, you see, when the English got Realization,

00:34:25.839 --> 00:34:28.138
they started telling Me about the English.

00:34:28.339 --> 00:34:30.490
When Italians got Realization,

00:34:30.691 --> 00:34:33.959
they started telling Me about the Italians.

00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:38.240
If you tell the Italians that "You see, this Italian fellow did this like that,"

00:34:38.441 --> 00:34:41.271
he said, "Italians after all, Mother, what will they do?

00:34:41.472 --> 00:34:44.724
They're just like this, You know." He himself is an Italian,

00:34:44.925 --> 00:34:48.233
but immediately he'll say. Same with the Russians, I have seen,

00:34:48.434 --> 00:34:52.311
it's very surprising that they start telling you

00:34:52.512 --> 00:34:56.241
about what's wrong with the Russians or with the Ukrainians,

00:34:56.442 --> 00:34:59.868
all of them are quite alike. Even Indians, they'll say,

00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:03.516
"After all this is Indian. You know Indian people how they are,

00:35:03.717 --> 00:35:07.661
Mother; they are doing like this." I was surprised that

00:35:07.865 --> 00:35:09.117
they themselves being Indians,

00:35:09.318 --> 00:35:12.961
how are they immediately telling Me about the Indians?

00:35:13.162 --> 00:35:16.727
And many things I have come to know about these countries

00:35:16.928 --> 00:35:20.157
through the, actually through the Sahaja Yogis only.

00:35:20.358 --> 00:35:23.410
When the Sahaja Yogis tell Me, I'm amazed

00:35:23.611 --> 00:35:26.207
that they are not identified with their country,

00:35:26.408 --> 00:35:28.488
they are not identified with anyone,

00:35:28.689 --> 00:35:31.332
even their own family they are not identified with.

00:35:31.533 --> 00:35:33.801
If they find something wrong, they'll tell Me,

00:35:34.002 --> 00:35:38.004
"Mother, my father is like that, my mother is like that."

00:35:38.205 --> 00:35:40.293
That is how you get detached,

00:35:40.494 --> 00:35:43.293
when you start seeing and not identified.

00:35:43.494 --> 00:35:47.207
If you are not identified with all these things,

00:35:47.408 --> 00:35:52.168
then you become a free person, you have the freedom.

00:35:52.369 --> 00:35:56.215
You become a person who is not attached to anyone

00:35:56.416 --> 00:36:00.746
because he's your father or she's your mother,

00:36:00.947 --> 00:36:03.152
or a sister or anyone.

00:36:03.353 --> 00:36:07.777
This attachment is a very dangerous one also.

00:36:07.978 --> 00:36:12.511
With the family attachment, we have lost many Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:12.712 --> 00:36:15.691
Because their family was funny, they got lost;

00:36:15.892 --> 00:36:17.636
they couldn't get out of it.

00:36:17.837 --> 00:36:22.199
We don't say that you detach yourself from family or get out of it,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:26.035
but in a subtle way you should understand what are they up to,

00:36:26.236 --> 00:36:30.523
and what they are doing. All these subtle understanding

00:36:30.724 --> 00:36:35.953
about everyone doesn't give you any right also to criticize them.

00:36:36.154 --> 00:36:39.766
You should see for yourself what's wrong with you.

00:36:39.967 --> 00:36:42.288
You know all these subtleties you criticize,

00:36:42.489 --> 00:36:45.108
that such a person is such, such a person is such,

00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:49.311
but you also have the same problems with you.

00:36:49.512 --> 00:36:54.233
That's why you get detachment only possibly,

00:36:54.434 --> 00:36:59.296
through this introspection through the mirror of your Spirit.

00:36:59.497 --> 00:37:04.366
So the spiritual life is very important to a person

00:37:04.567 --> 00:37:07.882
than anything else on this earth,

00:37:08.083 --> 00:37:10.773
because such a person has been seeking,

00:37:10.974 --> 00:37:14.992
he has been seeking the truth, he has been seeking the reality.

00:37:15.193 --> 00:37:18.915
And once you know the reality, you don't want to cling onto

00:37:19.116 --> 00:37:21.196
something which is not reality.

00:37:21.397 --> 00:37:26.954
You want to be a person who is above all these things,

00:37:27.155 --> 00:37:28.931
that you can see all these things.

00:37:29.132 --> 00:37:31.212
And that is how you can save others

00:37:31.413 --> 00:37:38.282
who are getting drowned into the ocean of darkness,

00:37:38.483 --> 00:37:42.595
into the ocean of misidentification,

00:37:42.796 --> 00:37:45.525
only when you are above these things.

00:37:45.726 --> 00:37:50.712
But mostly what happens is this, that you are identified,

00:37:50.913 --> 00:37:55.094
you are identified, "How can I do it? How can I say?"

00:37:55.295 --> 00:37:58.399
The countries where Sahaja Yoga has spread,

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.751
where there have been people who are not identified with those countries,

00:38:02.952 --> 00:38:05.571
and think that they have to help

00:38:05.772 --> 00:38:10.243
all these countrymen to come up, to join them.

00:38:10.444 --> 00:38:15.595
For that, tremendous patience and love is necessary.

00:38:15.796 --> 00:38:19.379
As you know this cosmic power, as they call it,

00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:24.262
which they say I'm the source: actually, it is the power of love,

00:38:24.463 --> 00:38:27.942
of divine love, of pure love.

00:38:28.143 --> 00:38:32.692
And such a love doesn't demand anything, doesn't want anything,

00:38:32.893 --> 00:38:35.411
but it acts, it works.

00:38:35.612 --> 00:38:38.747
For example, if you love somebody, you would not like to do

00:38:38.948 --> 00:38:42.685
something to displease that person.

00:38:42.886 --> 00:38:44.873
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis

00:38:45.074 --> 00:38:48.881
who do things which I really don't like,

00:38:49.082 --> 00:38:53.006
but I never show, I just keep quiet.

00:38:53.207 --> 00:38:56.912
But normally if a person has love for someone,

00:38:57.113 --> 00:39:00.482
he wouldn't do anything to displease

00:39:00.683 --> 00:39:05.099
or to trouble that person, or in any way hurt.

00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:07.951
Without that development within you,

00:39:08.152 --> 00:39:11.474
you cannot become collective.

00:39:11.675 --> 00:39:16.880
In collectivity what happens that you feel for others,

00:39:17.081 --> 00:39:19.943
you understand others. You may not show off,

00:39:20.144 --> 00:39:22.795
but you do, inside yourself you know.

00:39:22.996 --> 00:39:26.084
Supposing somebody has done lots of funny things with you,

00:39:26.285 --> 00:39:31.131
doesn't matter. But gradually you will see he will change,

00:39:31.332 --> 00:39:35.647
gradually he will become better, because he'll realize that

00:39:35.848 --> 00:39:40.608
whatever he has been doing has not been a correct thing to do.

00:39:40.809 --> 00:39:44.624
He will not only feel guilty, that's not the way, but he will say,

00:39:44.825 --> 00:39:48.874
"I should correct. Why did I do like this? I should not have done."

00:39:49.075 --> 00:39:52.710
Gradually he will improve, but for that you should have

00:39:52.911 --> 00:39:56.319
a great sense of forgiveness,

00:39:56.520 --> 00:39:59.171
great sense of understanding.

00:39:59.372 --> 00:40:02.679
Under circumstances, people also misbehave.

00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:06.656
Because they've had no training how to be all right,

00:40:06.857 --> 00:40:09.304
how to be humble, they misbehave.

00:40:09.505 --> 00:40:14.187
Because in their culture perhaps, there is nothing but just anger,

00:40:14.388 --> 00:40:16.867
and arrogance is regarded as something great,

00:40:17.068 --> 00:40:20.797
also they misbehave. Sometimes they come from such families

00:40:20.998 --> 00:40:25.344
where only arrogance is taught, so you can't help it.

00:40:25.545 --> 00:40:29.563
Such people are to be forgiven again and again,

00:40:29.764 --> 00:40:31.735
and see that they change.

00:40:31.936 --> 00:40:36.883
Because I have a faith that all human beings

00:40:37.084 --> 00:40:41.086
can be made into beautiful flowers of fragrance -

00:40:41.287 --> 00:40:46.594
all the human beings. But I know there are some difficult ones.

00:40:46.795 --> 00:40:50.315
Why? Because they don't want. If they don't want,

00:40:50.516 --> 00:40:54.104
if they don't have the pure desire, you cannot force it on them.

00:40:54.305 --> 00:40:58.792
So forget it, they are difficult people, forget about them.

00:40:58.993 --> 00:41:06.159
But those who want, those who have a great desire

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:09.292
which is absolutely pure desire -

00:41:09.493 --> 00:41:14.276
not for money, not for position, not for anything else,

00:41:14.477 --> 00:41:20.573
but for achieving a great state of spirituality -

00:41:20.774 --> 00:41:24.370
such people are to be helped at any cost.

00:41:24.571 --> 00:41:28.722
I know some of them have gone to very wrong gurus and they have suffered;

00:41:28.923 --> 00:41:32.042
they have a bad Agnya, they have all kinds of things.

00:41:32.243 --> 00:41:35.151
Doesn't matter, you should try to help them.

00:41:35.352 --> 00:41:37.820
If they can listen to you, if they can understand

00:41:38.021 --> 00:41:41.414
what you are telling them, I'm sure it will work out.

00:41:41.615 --> 00:41:44.633
It is worked out so much, as you can see now

00:41:44.834 --> 00:41:49.360
that in the foreign countries where I was just an Indian,

00:41:49.561 --> 00:41:53.696
how people have taken to it; how they have understood Me,

00:41:53.897 --> 00:41:56.587
and how they have become Sahaja Yogis

00:41:56.788 --> 00:41:59.321
of such a great value and level.

00:41:59.522 --> 00:42:03.641
We never had so many saints in the olden days, never.

00:42:03.842 --> 00:42:08.469
Only one saint would be born and he would be tortured.

00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:11.071
There were not so many to help each other

00:42:11.272 --> 00:42:13.329
and to protect each other.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:17.329
So collectivity is to be learned very well:

00:42:17.530 --> 00:42:21.587
how to be collective, how to be nice to each other;

00:42:21.788 --> 00:42:24.751
because later on when you become the guru,

00:42:24.952 --> 00:42:29.290
when you have to guide the people,

00:42:29.491 --> 00:42:32.665
you will know what are the problems of the collectivity are.

00:42:32.866 --> 00:42:37.212
Also you will know how to overcome that,

00:42:37.413 --> 00:42:40.681
how to make collectivity perfect.

00:42:40.882 --> 00:42:44.665
And once you learn that thing, you'll be amazed

00:42:44.866 --> 00:42:50.407
that you have mastered the art of being a guru.

00:42:50.608 --> 00:42:55.704
I would like to see so many of you becoming a real guru,

00:42:55.905 --> 00:43:01.204
real masters; not only in your jobs, in your talents,

00:43:01.405 --> 00:43:05.743
but in your own life.

00:43:05.944 --> 00:43:10.368
People should say that such and such person is a real guru.

00:43:10.569 --> 00:43:14.618
For that, as I said, you must learn obedience,

00:43:14.819 --> 00:43:19.251
complete obedience. You should not question the guru.

00:43:19.452 --> 00:43:21.017
Whatever is told to you, you must do;

00:43:21.218 --> 00:43:23.400
though in Sahaja Yoga I do not say that.

00:43:23.601 --> 00:43:25.650
Today is the first time I am saying it,

00:43:25.851 --> 00:43:28.853
because I find so many of you

00:43:29.054 --> 00:43:32.423
fall a little short of becoming perfect.

00:43:32.624 --> 00:43:35.462
You don't have to sacrifice anything, I have told you,

00:43:35.663 --> 00:43:37.946
you don't have to give up anything.

00:43:38.147 --> 00:43:41.634
You don't have to give up your families or anything,

00:43:41.835 --> 00:43:45.728
and do odd things just to show that you are perfect.

00:43:45.929 --> 00:43:48.142
But it's something, a state within yourself

00:43:48.343 --> 00:43:52.345
which you have to establish, where you become extremely humble,

00:43:52.546 --> 00:43:57.087
obedient, and you'll be glowing with this light, I am sure.

00:43:57.288 --> 00:44:02.126
Once you understand the importance, then

00:44:02.327 --> 00:44:05.639
you will dedicate yourself to become

00:44:05.840 --> 00:44:09.452
a personality of a real quality.

00:44:09.653 --> 00:44:12.280
It's very difficult, as people something say,

00:44:12.481 --> 00:44:14.647
but I think the easiest thing to be,

00:44:14.848 --> 00:44:19.725
because that's the most comfortable way of living in life -

00:44:19.926 --> 00:44:24.116
no use fighting, no use quarreling, nobody trying to show off,

00:44:24.317 --> 00:44:29.007
and all that. The care of everyone,

00:44:29.208 --> 00:44:31.757
the suggestion of care,

00:44:31.958 --> 00:44:36.905
is very much satisfying for others.

00:44:37.106 --> 00:44:40.100
A little care here and there, people like it.

00:44:40.301 --> 00:44:43.592
And that only comes from a very noble soul

00:44:43.793 --> 00:44:46.475
who bothers about small, small things,

00:44:46.676 --> 00:44:51.217
about whatever others need. It's not for your own advancement,

00:44:51.418 --> 00:44:56.272
it's not for your own sort of leadership, whatever you may call,

00:44:56.473 --> 00:45:01.639
or for your own positions - then you are falling short -

00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:04.897
but it's for your own ascent,

00:45:05.098 --> 00:45:11.577
for your higher life that you give up

00:45:11.778 --> 00:45:17.327
all these ideas of leadership and this and that.

00:45:17.528 --> 00:45:23.436
Is absurd the way sometimes I find some Sahaja Yogis

00:45:23.637 --> 00:45:31.679
are so anxious to assert themselves as leaders; it's not correct.

00:45:32.132 --> 00:45:35.087
So many times I have explained to you

00:45:35.288 --> 00:45:39.933
that your own development, your own correction,

00:45:40.134 --> 00:45:47.269
your own position in Sahaja Yoga will say what you are.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:49.441
Whatever others may say doesn't matter.

00:45:49.642 --> 00:45:54.652
What you say about yourself truly, truthfully, is the reality,

00:45:54.853 --> 00:45:57.300
and you must face yourself all the time.

00:45:57.501 --> 00:45:59.652
I would say, specially for the ladies,

00:45:59.853 --> 00:46:05.480
that I'm a woman and I have worked very hard all these years,

00:46:05.681 --> 00:46:12.675
and as a woman I must tell you that all the ladies should try;

00:46:12.876 --> 00:46:16.511
because they always say "We are shaktis,"

00:46:16.712 --> 00:46:20.472
but in their life I don't see there's any work done as shaktis,

00:46:20.673 --> 00:46:25.066
only their sort of dependence all the time on Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:25.267 --> 00:46:28.324
They have to stand up in their own freedom,

00:46:28.525 --> 00:46:29.972
they have to be independent,

00:46:30.173 --> 00:46:34.597
and they should have right ideas about everything.

00:46:34.798 --> 00:46:37.902
I'm sure if the ladies come up that way,

00:46:38.103 --> 00:46:41.129
Sahaja Yoga will spread very much.

00:46:41.330 --> 00:46:44.973
Men are working much more for Sahaja Yoga than women are.

00:46:45.174 --> 00:46:47.278
I can understand because they have families,

00:46:47.479 --> 00:46:49.591
they have children, this thing.

00:46:49.792 --> 00:46:51.755
But the most important thing is that

00:46:51.956 --> 00:46:55.146
once you take to active Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:55.347 --> 00:46:57.435
then your children also come up well,

00:46:57.636 --> 00:46:59.576
the family is also looked after.

00:46:59.777 --> 00:47:05.514
After all, there is this divine power which looks after all of you.

00:47:05.715 --> 00:47:09.998
You must believe that this pure divine power thinks,

00:47:10.199 --> 00:47:16.232
understands, it organizes; above all, it loves you.

00:47:16.433 --> 00:47:20.388
This divine power has to be understood that

00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:24.411
it is now your own

00:47:24.612 --> 00:47:27.731
and that you are in the realm of this divine power,

00:47:27.932 --> 00:47:31.051
where you won't have any problems whatsoever.

00:47:31.252 --> 00:47:36.262
If you leave things to the divine power, it will all work out.

00:47:36.463 --> 00:47:40.012
As you know about this scientist who found out about Me.

00:47:40.213 --> 00:47:44.762
I have to just say that he asked Me that

00:47:44.963 --> 00:47:49.653
"How is it this so many hearts are made here?"

00:47:49.854 --> 00:47:52.591
I said, "It's people who are singing the song,

00:47:52.792 --> 00:47:54.982
'Sitting in the Heart of the Universe.'

00:47:55.183 --> 00:47:57.763
So this many hearts have come up."

00:47:57.964 --> 00:48:01.990
But he said, "Still, does this power hear?"

00:48:02.191 --> 00:48:06.865
I said, "No, it's Me only, I can hear.

00:48:07.066 --> 00:48:13.248
I was hearing the song, and then the power organizes everything."

00:48:13.449 --> 00:48:15.865
It's something to be understood very well

00:48:16.066 --> 00:48:21.990
that the power within you, what you have, understands,

00:48:22.191 --> 00:48:25.154
and understand you also.

00:48:25.355 --> 00:48:30.623
It is a way of power which is your own power,

00:48:30.824 --> 00:48:34.715
but you cannot control it.

00:48:34.926 --> 00:48:38.599
It knows about you. Whenever you are falling,

00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:41.912
when you are doing wrong, the same power which protects you

00:48:42.113 --> 00:48:44.053
and loves you like a mother,

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:48.529
will correct you and bring you to the right path.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:52.490
I think now a new century is starting

00:48:52.691 --> 00:48:54.748
and so many things have to happen,

00:48:54.949 --> 00:48:59.357
and all of you must decide that you'll do this or that.

00:48:59.558 --> 00:49:05.576
Whatever is your understanding is about spreading Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:05.777 --> 00:49:09.662
you should try to; all of you should put your mind to it.

00:49:09.863 --> 00:49:13.748
If women can't go out they can write down something,

00:49:13.949 --> 00:49:17.920
they can write about their spiritual ascent

00:49:18.121 --> 00:49:22.936
or about whatever their experiences are.

00:49:23.137 --> 00:49:26.029
So in any case all those who have got also

00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:30.107
very miraculous photographs, they should send it over here.

00:49:30.308 --> 00:49:34.029
Very important is, because this gentleman is coming here in September,

00:49:34.230 --> 00:49:36.521
and he's going to analyze all of them.

00:49:36.722 --> 00:49:39.310
So it would be very nice of you if you can send it.

00:49:39.511 --> 00:49:45.277
Also you write down about your different experiences

00:49:45.478 --> 00:49:49.050
you have had in Sahaja Yoga: that would be also a good idea.

00:49:49.251 --> 00:49:52.878
He told Me that he would like to publish a book like that;

00:49:53.079 --> 00:49:56.323
and now the time has come for us to publish

00:49:56.524 --> 00:49:59.604
our miracles that have taken place.

00:49:59.805 --> 00:50:02.760
All of you have had some experience of the miracle.

00:50:02.961 --> 00:50:06.705
So I have to request you to send you, as soon as possible,

00:50:06.906 --> 00:50:11.736
written well in English language or in Hindi language or Marathi,

00:50:11.937 --> 00:50:14.517
because I don't understand other languages.

00:50:14.718 --> 00:50:16.705
And please don't send Me in other languages,

00:50:16.906 --> 00:50:20.353
we'll have to appoint somebody to translate them in fourteen languages,

00:50:20.554 --> 00:50:24.916
it's a difficult thing. So I would request you to send that.

00:50:25.117 --> 00:50:28.408
I am sure today's lecture, you will again go through it

00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:31.392
and understand it, and work it out.

00:50:31.593 --> 00:50:36.296
May God bless you.
