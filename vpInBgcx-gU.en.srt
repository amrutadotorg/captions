1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:28,160
(Shri Mataji asks the audience in Hindi
to ask Her questions.)

2
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,440
(A seeker asks a question.)

3
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,880
SHRI MATAJI: How one gets it, isn’t it?

4
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:34,080
All right, sit down.

5
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:37,160
That’s what I’ve been saying —
that it just works out.

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,480
It is a spontaneous happening.

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,480
Now, we’ll see one thing,

8
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,520
that how does a little seed
gets into a tree?

9
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,240
It’s a living process.

10
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,440
You’ll just say it just works out.

11
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:52,200
It is already there,
that’s why it is sahaja.

12
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,280
“Saha” means “with”, “ja” means “born”.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,880
It is absolutely spontaneous.

14
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,960
I am an enlightened person, is a fact.

15
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,080
And when I touch you,
you get enlightenment yourself.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,640
It’s a very, very simple thing.
All right?

17
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,360
Another question?

18
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,120
This was a nice one,
because we always say of “how”.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,360
SEEKER: Enlightenment through
other methods,

20
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,600
with siddhis [supernatural powers].
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

21
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,640
SEEKER: With siddhis,
that’s what they are called.

22
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:29,920
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, is wrong.

23
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:32,120
That is always been banned.

24
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,880
You see, in the olden days also
we had people who were misled.

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,680
That is the history.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,680
There are some people…
now, for example, if we had Hitler,

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,880
that doesn’t mean he’s a praman
[right measure, authority].

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,800
If we had somebody like…
a satanic force like Ravan,

29
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,720
doesn’t mean that he was praman.

30
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:55,920
For us, pramani is whatever achieved
the maximum.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,920
So the praman always remains the best.

32
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:01,640
You see, all such people
who say that it gives siddhis

33
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,360
are the people who are Tantrikas
[followers of the Tantra doctrine].

34
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,080
And they were all thrown out.

35
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,520
These are all known as kshudrata
[insignificance, meanness].

36
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,480
But some of the people
who have written books on these things

37
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:17,680
are not themselves realized,
have read this book, that book,

38
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:20,320
and then they have said
that their siddhis are also there.

39
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:24,360
Siddhis are nothing but you move on
to your supraconscious side.

40
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,280
And when you move on
to a supraconscious side,
a spirit comes into you.

41
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,440
And then what happens — you start
producing something from your hand…

42
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:34,480
We had one lady in our Sahaja Yoga,
she came to us,

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,240
and, you know, when I went to America,

44
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:38,920
she started showing
all kinds of chamatkaras [wonders].

45
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,480
She started telling people

46
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:43,600
that “Where is your money’s lost,
you can find there,” like that.

47
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,280
And she became very popular,
and she used to get one thousand people

48
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,560
everyday coming to her.

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,520
And ultimately she started telling them
even the number of the [UNCLEAR].

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,880
So the supraconscious things
can be like that.

51
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:00,080
ESP, you become
an extrasensory perceptive man,

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,360
and all that is nothing
but another spirit.

53
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,440
But human beings sit tight.

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,840
You’ll be surprised, from America
two great scientists came just to see Me.

55
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,920
For what?

56
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,560
They said, “You must teach us how to fly
in the air. We want to leave our body.”

57
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:16,800
I said, “Why? Are you not flying
already on our heads?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,200
Now what do you want to do?”

59
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,760
They said, “Now we want to leave
our bodies and fly in the air.”

60
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,280
So I said, “But if I tell you

61
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,880
that this is done through the spirits,
will you do it?” —

62
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,320
“Yes, still we want to do it.”

63
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:28,520
I said, “Why?”

64
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,680
They said, “Because Russians are doing
the same, so we want to do.”

65
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:35,920
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)

66
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,440
Then I said…
and they would not, you see.

67
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,960
Then I asked them, “Who told you?”
So they said, “Patanjali.”

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,440
You know, Patanjali is a newspaper man.

69
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,720
And Patanjali… I said,
“Look at this fellow, he came for treatment

70
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,680
because he used to get this kind of a…
experience that used to leave his body,

71
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,760
and he came to Me for getting cured.”

72
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,320
And he is telling him, you go to Mataji
and She’ll make you that!

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:03,320
And these fools, you know,
they would not listen to Me!

74
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:08,600
So, the knowledge that we have…

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:12,280
we do not have a proper method
of discrimination.

76
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,560
We don’t know what is
absolute knowledge. This is wrong.

77
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,760
For that, you must have vibrations.

78
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,160
With vibrations. Now you can ask,
all those who are realized,

79
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,320
you can ask: “Is there God or not?”
See the answer you’ll get.

80
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,840
[UNCLEAR] means yes.

81
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:42,000
All answers come,
and you can record it on your hands.

82
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,560
Even to a small thing.

83
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:47,440
You must hear Pharkay,
today he was telling Me about this,

84
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:51,200
that when he… some gentleman
was somewhere,

85
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
and he said
that “You just find his vibrations.”

86
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,680
So he put his hands there,

87
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,280
and he said, “Let me see the vibrations” —
and nothing was coming,

88
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,960
and nothing you could feel,
and nothing of the chakras.

89
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:02,960
So he then said, “He cannot be there,
because I cannot feel anything.”

90
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,800
So, this man thought of him:
“Oh, yes, yes.

91
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,440
He must be on the aeroplane,
he is not there.”

92
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:10,640
To such an extent it goes!

93
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,840
In London, there’s one gentleman,

94
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,120
he said, “Mataji, can I feel
somebody’s vibrations?”

95
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,560
I said, “You can.” —

96
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,960
“Can I feel my father’s?”

97
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,600
I said, “Yes. All right,
you put your hands and ask a question.”

98
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,760
Immediately his Vishuddhi Chakra
started burning.

99
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:24,040
He said, “Mother, this is burning.”

100
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,440
I said, “You telephone to him just now.
Ask how he is.”

101
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:31,000
So his mother said, “He cannot talk
to you, his throat is very bad.”

102
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:35,920
And the father was very far away.

103
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:40,800
“He cannot talk to you,
his throat is very bad” —
Vishuddhi Chakra is catching.

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,480
All the information you get
on your hand, on your vibrations.

105
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,600
And then, when you’ll see these books,
you’ll be surprised
they’ll be burning your hands.

106
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,200
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Hindi.)

107
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:03,960
You’ll be amazed that how you find out
who is a real guru and non-real guru.

108
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,920
It’s so correct with this!

109
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,080
We have got here a case of one lady.

110
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,720
She told Me that somebody
came to see her,

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,800
and, I mean, somebody
came to stay with her,

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,360
her own brother or someone very near.

113
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,200
And she started burning
all the time, this and that.

114
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:21,560
So she said,
“Do you go to Satya Sai Baba?”

115
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:23,240
He said, “No.”

116
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,440
She said, “No, but how can that be?
I am getting terrible burning,

117
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,560
as I get it from a disciple
of Satya Sai Baba.

118
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,040
You must have been somewhere.
You must have been.”
He said, “I’ve never been there.”

119
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,120
So she said, “Really?”

120
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:34,240
And she was searching him out,
and nothing was there.

121
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:39,280
So she opened his box, and in the box
there was a Satya Sai Baba’s photograph.

122
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,400
Our [UNCLEAR] is here, you can ask him.

123
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,480
His wife… his daughter-in-law
was a big problem in London.

124
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,600
And they didn’t know how to locate
why she was behaving like this

125
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,440
and she was giving them
burning like that.

126
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,400
They opened her purse one day,
and in the purse was that photograph.

127
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,520
The day they threw it away,
everything is all right.

128
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,240
Otherwise it was going to be a divorce,

129
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,080
for nothing at all — the poor lady
was vomiting, doing all kinds of things.

130
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,280
There are so many cases like that.

131
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,560
I mean, the proof is there.

132
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:19,160
(Shri Mataji says a few phrases
in Marathi.)

133
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,040
He called us to some place

134
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,920
where there was a centre
of Satya Sai Baba.

135
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,080
He said, “Mataji, You must save
those people.”

136
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:28,920
When I sat there,
so many children just fainted.

137
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,720
Then they told us that “These children
have been fainting like this.

138
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,840
You have to do something about it.

139
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,000
And so many children are lost.

140
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,880
They just go away.
God knows how they are lost.”

141
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,360
I told him, “Baba, his centre,
let him look after now. I am fed up.”

142
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,360
What am I to do now?

143
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,000
I must first of all create some doctors,
some realized souls.

144
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,120
When I have some more people
to work it out, we can work it out.

145
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:59,280
But one thing is there:
after getting Realization you must come,

146
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,440
and learn it, and master everything.

147
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,280
You become… I tell you,
each and everything of Kundalini,

148
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:06,200
you can just master it.

149
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,400
It’s very easy.

150
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:11,200
It is so easy and it helps you.

151
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,960
You know this is the power of love;
you must know how it is worked out.

152
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,960
We know all the power of hatred only.

153
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:19,840
Supposing somebody
is very unkind to you.

154
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:22,080
I’ll tell you
about My husband’s secretary.

155
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,560
She got her Realization.
And she said, “I have got neighbours,

156
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,040
some three, four young boys,
and they are horrible hippies.

157
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,160
They are making noise,
and they are troublesome,
and they call me an old hen.

158
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,800
What have I to do
if they just make fun of me?”

159
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,560
I said, “All right, what will you do?”

160
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,040
She said, “I’m really fed up,
I’m going to give up the house.”

161
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,000
I said, “You just don’t do like that.

162
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,360
You just go and put a bandhan
on their house,

163
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:48,960
every day thrice, like this,
and just think of Me with love.”

164
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,080
Now she says that it is quiet
like a churchyard.

165
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,400
“They are very quiet.

166
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,600
And they are very kind,
they open the lift for me.

167
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,800
When I go, they help me.”

168
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:36,360
(A seeker asks a question in Hindi.
Shri Mataji answers first in Hindi
and then continues in English.)

169
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,560
You are the instrument.

170
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,920
You are the instrument,
you are the medicine,

171
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,760
you are the curer,
you are the doctor,

172
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,040
you are the computer,
you are everything.

173
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,040
But you should become your Self.

174
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,000
You have to become your Self.

175
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,240
(Shri Mataji continues to speak in Hindi.)
