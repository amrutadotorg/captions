WEBVTT

00:52.716 --> 00:56.227
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

00:56.942 --> 00:59.034
They had planned everything.

00:59.154 --> 01:03.514
They had all the arrangements made

01:03.634 --> 01:06.185
and the sari was missing.

01:06.305 --> 01:12.025
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

01:12.145 --> 01:13.779
so now what to do?

01:13.899 --> 01:18.161
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

01:18.281 --> 01:21.372
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

01:21.492 --> 01:23.706
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

01:23.826 --> 01:26.684
otherwise we can have it later.

01:26.841 --> 01:30.706
But I was least disturbed,

01:31.303 --> 01:33.892
least upset.

01:34.012 --> 01:38.344
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

01:40.421 --> 01:41.970
But if you have a mental conception,

01:42.090 --> 01:45.135
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

01:45.255 --> 01:48.348
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

01:48.468 --> 01:54.270
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

01:57.614 --> 01:59.683
But that is what we cannot do.

01:59.803 --> 02:01.938
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

02:02.058 --> 02:05.236
This is what it is.

02:08.414 --> 02:11.976
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

02:12.096 --> 02:14.419
That’s one of the things.

02:14.661 --> 02:18.256
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

02:18.376 --> 02:23.913
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

02:24.505 --> 02:27.509
because we make a mental projection.

02:27.629 --> 02:29.909
Mentally we calculate something.

02:30.029 --> 02:31.249
This has to be.

02:31.369 --> 02:36.741
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

02:37.054 --> 02:43.393
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

02:43.513 --> 02:46.133
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

02:46.253 --> 02:50.974
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

02:51.094 --> 02:53.072
only about two o’clock.

02:53.192 --> 02:54.432
He said, “Why not in the morning?”

02:54.552 --> 02:58.256
“I don’t think it will be feasible.”

03:00.503 --> 03:04.682
So this is how you become avyagra.

03:04.809 --> 03:09.235
Vyagra means person who is worried.

03:09.355 --> 03:12.625
The one who is not worried.

03:12.745 --> 03:15.211
So we worry because of two things.

03:15.331 --> 03:23.317
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

03:26.000 --> 03:28.237
Future doesn’t exist.

03:28.357 --> 03:29.863
If you have made up your mind

03:29.983 --> 03:31.628
that this should happen in the future,

03:31.748 --> 03:35.397
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

03:36.418 --> 03:39.000
But you have not made any mental picture,

03:39.120 --> 03:41.318
you will see what comes on the scene.

03:41.438 --> 03:46.051
You’ll watch whatever appears.

03:46.171 --> 03:48.815
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

03:48.935 --> 03:51.460
what’s going to happen.

03:51.580 --> 03:57.076
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

03:57.196 --> 04:00.807
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

04:00.927 --> 04:07.889
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

04:08.049 --> 04:10.108
and we are not having it.”

04:10.228 --> 04:11.934
So you are upset.

04:12.054 --> 04:15.810
What difference does it make?

04:15.930 --> 04:21.149
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

04:21.269 --> 04:23.445
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

04:23.565 --> 04:28.102
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

04:28.278 --> 04:30.438
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

04:30.558 --> 04:34.737
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

04:36.369 --> 04:39.394
We really decorated ourselves well.

04:39.515 --> 04:41.192
We were all ready for the puja,

04:41.312 --> 04:42.965
we were sitting here for the puja,

04:43.085 --> 04:46.475
and now what has happened!

04:48.598 --> 04:53.069
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

04:53.677 --> 04:56.892
I knew what was coming.

05:05.150 --> 05:07.788
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

05:07.908 --> 05:10.211
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

05:10.331 --> 05:12.304
I’m busy with Myself.

05:12.424 --> 05:17.759
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

05:20.664 --> 05:26.494
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

05:26.845 --> 05:30.459
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

05:30.579 --> 05:32.766
In India people come.

05:32.886 --> 05:35.919
They keep so much money for buying things.

05:36.039 --> 05:39.738
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

05:39.951 --> 05:41.800
what you call traders.

05:41.920 --> 05:43.826
The customs are so kind, I mean

05:43.946 --> 05:46.025
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

05:46.145 --> 05:48.456
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

05:48.576 --> 05:50.484
And then they have a mental picture,

05:50.604 --> 05:55.206
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

05:55.837 --> 05:58.037
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

05:58.157 --> 06:02.334
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

06:02.496 --> 06:05.139
So then they might go to spend some money.

06:05.259 --> 06:08.998
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

06:09.560 --> 06:13.686
It has happened with all of you.

06:13.806 --> 06:15.511
So they go and buy something.

06:15.631 --> 06:19.534
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

06:19.654 --> 06:23.047
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

06:23.167 --> 06:26.244
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

06:26.364 --> 06:28.165
How many pounds you paid for that?

06:28.285 --> 06:32.031
Gavin: Forty pounds.

06:32.151 --> 06:34.186
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

06:34.306 --> 06:37.836
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

06:37.956 --> 06:39.811
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

06:39.811 --> 06:44.605
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

06:44.725 --> 06:47.076
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

06:47.196 --> 06:52.251
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

06:52.371 --> 06:54.938
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

06:55.058 --> 06:57.399
They thought they’ve bought something great.

06:57.519 --> 07:00.831
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

07:00.951 --> 07:02.613
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

07:02.733 --> 07:04.510
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.497
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

07:07.617 --> 07:12.469
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

07:15.615 --> 07:17.993
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

07:18.113 --> 07:21.346
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

07:21.466 --> 07:24.747
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

07:24.867 --> 07:27.291
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

07:27.411 --> 07:29.412
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

07:29.532 --> 07:32.303
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

07:32.423 --> 07:35.079
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

07:35.199 --> 07:36.171
He said, “What is the price?”

07:36.291 --> 07:39.814
I said, “Forty pounds.”

07:40.687 --> 07:43.889
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

07:44.009 --> 07:46.515
And he bought it for forty pounds.

07:46.635 --> 07:49.041
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

07:49.161 --> 07:52.811
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

07:54.762 --> 07:58.480
And I found it out that,

07:58.600 --> 08:03.422
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

08:03.797 --> 08:08.165
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

08:08.285 --> 08:13.377
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

08:13.497 --> 08:16.105
And if you start making it flexible then

08:16.247 --> 08:19.710
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

08:19.830 --> 08:22.314
very early. Now he’s different.

08:22.434 --> 08:25.381
So if you become flexible,

08:25.501 --> 08:29.277
then what happens you see the joy of it.

08:29.397 --> 08:32.972
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

08:33.092 --> 08:36.275
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

08:36.395 --> 08:39.123
And you can never enjoy it,

08:39.243 --> 08:44.169
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.565
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

08:46.685 --> 08:49.407
You see it is all your own creation.

08:49.527 --> 08:53.440
The mental projection is your creation,

08:53.560 --> 08:59.383
and also the destruction is your creation.

08:59.958 --> 09:04.052
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

09:05.582 --> 09:08.487
But who does that is Mahamaya,

09:08.607 --> 09:12.392
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

09:12.512 --> 09:16.637
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

09:16.757 --> 09:18.619
I have to go to Birmingham.

09:18.739 --> 09:24.064
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

09:24.184 --> 09:25.561
After some time you will find

09:25.681 --> 09:28.859
that it’s impossible to do something,

09:28.979 --> 09:32.410
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.287
Because whenever you will try to do something,

09:34.407 --> 09:39.089
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

09:39.209 --> 09:42.945
If not, then it will make you realize

09:43.065 --> 09:46.192
what is important, what you’ve missed.

09:47.406 --> 09:51.666
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

09:51.786 --> 09:54.947
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

09:55.067 --> 09:58.178
What to do? Now where to go?”

10:01.275 --> 10:03.894
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

10:04.014 --> 10:06.546
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

10:06.666 --> 10:10.363
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

10:10.483 --> 10:16.443
for days together. I just see that there.

10:19.489 --> 10:27.898
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

10:29.473 --> 10:32.660
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

10:32.780 --> 10:35.232
at any cost.

10:35.948 --> 10:41.102
Then that acts as a guide

10:41.643 --> 10:47.694
and you understand the flexibility

10:47.814 --> 10:51.683
of all these worldly, transitory things.

10:52.724 --> 10:54.676
They are all changeable,

10:54.796 --> 10:59.416
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

11:02.812 --> 11:05.758
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

11:05.878 --> 11:10.058
which is very important subject.

11:12.113 --> 11:16.412
I think I have talked about it many a times.

11:16.532 --> 11:20.705
But in the West I must say,

11:20.825 --> 11:28.392
because of our wrong attitudes

11:32.175 --> 11:38.379
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections

11:38.499 --> 11:42.326
of other people who are very dominating,

11:43.262 --> 11:49.566
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

11:51.722 --> 11:55.585
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

11:55.705 --> 12:00.624
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara had,

12:00.756 --> 12:04.158
and has sustained itself,

12:04.770 --> 12:10.140
we must know that we can always fall a trap

12:10.260 --> 12:19.556
to our different bifurcations which we had created before.

12:22.011 --> 12:25.788
It's a very serious matter

12:25.908 --> 12:32.302
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really shattered,

12:32.464 --> 12:36.868
and we have created pathways

12:36.988 --> 12:40.317
into which our attention can go

12:40.437 --> 12:44.044
if we are not very careful.

12:45.592 --> 12:49.365
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,

12:49.485 --> 12:52.958
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

12:53.078 --> 12:59.083
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

12:59.910 --> 13:02.495
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

13:02.622 --> 13:06.740
“Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do such a thing?”

13:10.373 --> 13:17.809
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,

13:17.929 --> 13:20.681
sin against the Mother,

13:23.104 --> 13:28.960
it's a secretive action

13:29.080 --> 13:33.007
that's only between you and yourself.

13:33.825 --> 13:38.989
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except for you.

13:39.607 --> 13:43.799
Nobody knows what you are going to do

13:44.807 --> 13:51.424
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

13:52.507 --> 13:56.702
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

13:56.822 --> 14:00.127
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

14:00.247 --> 14:03.452
To be very frank with you,

14:03.572 --> 14:08.762
that's one center I find it difficult to feel Myself.

14:08.882 --> 14:16.649
The reason is, I have a very, very strong Mooladhara,

14:19.230 --> 14:24.328
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

14:25.133 --> 14:26.726
It is not bothered.

14:26.852 --> 14:31.174
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

14:31.294 --> 14:34.879
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes back,

14:34.999 --> 14:37.103
that's the action it plays all the time.

14:37.223 --> 14:41.186
So I also, unless and until it is very badly off,

14:41.306 --> 14:43.753
I mean the person is very close to Me,

14:43.873 --> 14:45.973
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.882
But still I can?

14:49.002 --> 14:53.556
Supposing you give Me something, that thing is used by you,

14:53.676 --> 14:57.029
immediately I can feel it.

14:57.661 --> 15:03.311
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends on you.

15:03.431 --> 15:07.112
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot rise high,

15:07.232 --> 15:09.569
do what you like.

15:12.025 --> 15:16.653
Now for people who are Indian,

15:16.773 --> 15:20.438
who have respected their Mooladharas,

15:20.558 --> 15:23.379
there are so many methods and ways given

15:23.499 --> 15:30.562
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

15:30.682 --> 15:34.429
But that won't work out with the Western people,

15:34.549 --> 15:38.169
because it's a damaged one.

15:38.289 --> 15:42.036
It's one which is a shattered one,

15:42.156 --> 15:45.712
and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara,

15:45.832 --> 15:49.909
but on the emotional side as we call the “Mana”,

15:50.029 --> 15:53.683
the left side.

15:55.597 --> 16:01.091
So, even you may not talk in that way,

16:01.211 --> 16:06.325
but your mind is still in that realm.

16:06.885 --> 16:10.911
And you still think on that realm.

16:11.031 --> 16:15.995
Even mentally, you are in it.

16:17.265 --> 16:21.086
Or you are seeing things,

16:21.206 --> 16:24.103
wanting to see such things,

16:24.223 --> 16:27.541
wanting to enjoy such things.

16:27.661 --> 16:31.821
That lurking attraction is still there,

16:31.941 --> 16:35.141
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

16:36.825 --> 16:42.554
And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people.

16:42.674 --> 16:47.402
I would not say the same to the people from India.

16:48.805 --> 16:52.981
So now we have to work out much harder.

16:53.101 --> 16:59.528
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

16:59.648 --> 17:05.746
And it is more a mental activity.

17:08.195 --> 17:12.342
“Mental” meaning I mean the emotional side.

17:12.462 --> 17:15.268
You have to watch your mind.

17:15.388 --> 17:20.041
In English, it's a very funny word “mind” is. But “Mana”,

17:20.161 --> 17:27.745
through which we cater to our emotional side, to our desires.

17:29.597 --> 17:32.098
Where is it going?

17:32.218 --> 17:35.258
Where is this movement of our mind?

17:35.378 --> 17:38.029
What is it doing?

17:38.149 --> 17:40.891
You have to stand against your mind,

17:41.011 --> 17:43.731
stand against your desires,

17:43.851 --> 17:45.911
or you can face it

17:46.031 --> 17:51.501
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

17:52.439 --> 17:55.933
It's for you to decide.

17:56.071 --> 18:00.467
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

18:00.587 --> 18:03.256
I know you people have been confessing to Me.

18:03.376 --> 18:05.599
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

18:05.719 --> 18:08.574
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read it.

18:08.694 --> 18:10.531
Whatever confessions you have made,

18:10.651 --> 18:13.051
I burnt all those letters.

18:13.171 --> 18:17.028
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

18:17.148 --> 18:19.330
Nor do I want to know about it.

18:19.450 --> 18:22.891
That's not My concern.

18:23.011 --> 18:27.178
My concern is that now

18:27.298 --> 18:34.938
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

18:35.931 --> 18:39.807
on the same level,

18:39.927 --> 18:44.408
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

18:46.581 --> 18:50.611
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat

18:50.731 --> 18:53.805
the thoughts that come to you

18:53.925 --> 18:56.293
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

18:56.413 --> 19:00.934
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your Mooladhara.

19:01.967 --> 19:07.566
And we have some physical treatment for such bhoots also,

19:08.905 --> 19:12.300
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

19:12.420 --> 19:14.659
which you can ask.

19:14.779 --> 19:16.552
But you cannot always say that,

19:16.672 --> 19:19.252
“It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away from the bhoot.”

19:19.372 --> 19:22.191
You are not. Whenever you say, “I have a bhoot,”

19:22.318 --> 19:26.842
means you yourself you’re siding with the bhoot.

19:31.789 --> 19:40.166
You see a person as a Sakshi.

19:40.286 --> 19:43.892
That means you see that person

19:44.012 --> 19:48.424
but you do not get a reaction,

19:48.544 --> 19:55.175
which is killer of joy.

19:57.484 --> 20:03.141
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very well.

20:03.261 --> 20:11.179
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

20:11.352 --> 20:14.487
And be alert about it.

20:14.607 --> 20:18.462
If you want to be kind to yourself,

20:18.644 --> 20:24.538
know that you have to divert your attention

20:24.658 --> 20:27.745
towards a sane married life.

20:27.865 --> 20:31.867
But also that should not be too much.

20:31.987 --> 20:34.845
Because what I have learnt now,

20:34.965 --> 20:38.657
that in the West people have devised methods

20:38.825 --> 20:41.186
of transferring their attention

20:41.306 --> 20:45.097
from one person to another.

20:45.418 --> 20:49.070
Mental acrobatics of different type

20:49.190 --> 20:54.918
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

20:55.038 --> 20:59.291
Don’t play onto these.

21:04.057 --> 21:08.058
There are so many other things by which

21:08.178 --> 21:12.280
we express that we are still under the trap

21:12.400 --> 21:14.234
of a bad Mooladhara.

21:14.354 --> 21:16.669
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

21:16.789 --> 21:20.262
the way you sit, the way you talk,

21:20.382 --> 21:31.603
the way you behave, to impress other people.

21:33.077 --> 21:38.402
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja Yoga itself.

21:38.522 --> 21:41.554
The only impression that should really work

21:41.674 --> 21:48.093
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

21:50.119 --> 21:52.672
You can do it; it's not difficult.

21:52.792 --> 21:56.413
When the Kundalini can rise with all such shattered

21:56.533 --> 22:01.242
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara completely.

22:01.377 --> 22:05.624
But your question is first of all

22:05.744 --> 22:08.421
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

22:08.541 --> 22:14.246
for which I think you all have to go into a kind of tapasya.

22:15.407 --> 22:17.784
That's why I say sometimes

22:17.904 --> 22:22.116
that the Western people should take to less of meat,

22:22.236 --> 22:26.944
especially the red meats and beefs,

22:27.064 --> 22:31.831
and horses, and dogs

22:33.885 --> 22:38.039
and I don't know what else you eat.

22:42.029 --> 22:45.011
Take more to vegetarian food.

22:45.131 --> 22:48.651
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand that.

22:48.771 --> 22:50.347
Take more to things

22:50.467 --> 22:54.192
which do not give you so much heat in the body.

22:55.772 --> 22:59.845
Even fish is very [inaudible].

23:00.704 --> 23:04.854
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,

23:04.974 --> 23:10.515
but don't take to these horrible health foods also.

23:10.651 --> 23:13.015
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

23:13.135 --> 23:16.364
They're not meant for human beings, but for animals I think.

23:16.484 --> 23:21.132
They churn your stomach completely, and it's horrible.

23:21.252 --> 23:25.737
This Country Store thing I took once and I said “had enough of it!”

23:25.999 --> 23:29.731
Country Store - the whole country went into My stomach.

23:33.935 --> 23:36.471
So for you people,

23:36.622 --> 23:38.854
(You have to go?)

23:39.404 --> 23:48.263
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must know

23:48.421 --> 23:53.848
that food does make a difference

23:53.968 --> 23:57.758
in the powers of Mooladhara.

23:58.382 --> 24:02.480
So if you have to get it cured, first of all

24:02.600 --> 24:06.136
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

24:06.256 --> 24:08.880
over-excited.

24:09.000 --> 24:11.559
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

24:11.679 --> 24:13.252
any woman you look at ...

24:13.372 --> 24:16.876
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

24:17.360 --> 24:19.333
Horrible.

24:19.453 --> 24:22.714
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

24:22.834 --> 24:28.332
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon your Mooladhara.

24:28.452 --> 24:31.095
There's no grace.

24:31.215 --> 24:34.506
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

24:34.626 --> 24:37.651
“you must respect yourself.”

24:37.771 --> 24:41.380
It cannot work out with those words I know.

24:45.997 --> 24:50.024
You have to sit down,

24:50.144 --> 24:56.154
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

24:59.041 --> 25:00.766
I'll discuss with Gavin and I’ll tell him

25:00.886 --> 25:02.285
what things can be done about it,

25:02.405 --> 25:06.249
because I can't tell you in the open like this.

25:06.369 --> 25:10.418
But still this is all physical.

25:10.538 --> 25:15.516
Mentally you must be on the watch

25:15.636 --> 25:20.047
to see where does this mind go - to dirty things.

25:20.189 --> 25:25.085
Why does it always go to this sensation?

25:25.591 --> 25:32.448
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

25:32.568 --> 25:38.274
see the beautiful people, just see them.

25:40.196 --> 25:42.398
Another horrible thing in the West

25:42.518 --> 25:44.987
is that the women must expose their body

25:45.107 --> 25:47.388
to get men excited.

25:47.508 --> 25:49.446
Men do the same I think.

25:49.566 --> 25:51.215
They always try to excite each other

25:51.335 --> 25:55.157
and live in a stupid excitement.

25:58.348 --> 26:03.407
You have to expose beautiful things, like flowers,

26:03.527 --> 26:06.374
beautiful ornaments.

26:06.494 --> 26:11.388
All right? But you're not a thing!

26:13.909 --> 26:23.220
It's your private property.

26:23.753 --> 26:28.064
You don't put all your gold on the streets, do you?

26:28.184 --> 26:31.312
Better try that, sometimes.

26:31.432 --> 26:34.861
You will mind people plundering your gold,

26:34.981 --> 26:38.561
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

26:38.681 --> 26:42.467
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

26:42.587 --> 26:44.489
You don't feel insulted?

26:44.609 --> 26:48.389
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind.

26:48.509 --> 26:52.862
It feels happy that people are watching you.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.250
They are plundering you.

26:57.370 --> 27:00.849
They are looting your chastity.

27:05.624 --> 27:09.044
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

27:09.164 --> 27:13.686
But still I must say you must cleanse your hearts,

27:13.806 --> 27:20.028
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

27:25.083 --> 27:29.519
The minds are very funnily placed,

27:29.639 --> 27:33.286
and that's why the greatest complications there are

27:33.406 --> 27:36.573
in the brains of people.

27:36.693 --> 27:39.879
They are very confused,

27:39.999 --> 27:43.589
very confused people.

27:43.922 --> 27:47.035
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life.

27:47.155 --> 27:52.208
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

27:53.204 --> 27:56.180
It is actually just the other way round.

27:56.300 --> 28:00.040
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve money.

28:00.160 --> 28:03.303
If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it.

28:03.423 --> 28:06.516
If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

28:06.636 --> 28:09.075
And why not this property of yours

28:09.195 --> 28:10.815
which is the highest of all,

28:10.935 --> 28:14.739
to be preserved, to be adorned,

28:14.859 --> 28:17.681
to be worshipped?

28:22.068 --> 28:25.034
I'm quite worried on that point

28:25.154 --> 28:31.477
that secretly people are indulging into such things.

28:31.597 --> 28:33.646
And they’re hypocritical sometimes,

28:33.766 --> 28:35.949
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

28:36.069 --> 28:38.612
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

28:38.732 --> 28:41.351
but in this matter they think they can go about

28:41.471 --> 28:44.213
the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that

28:44.333 --> 28:48.281
“Mother has said it’s all right.” I never said so!

28:48.401 --> 28:52.569
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

28:53.848 --> 28:56.675
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

28:56.795 --> 28:59.383
towards your life, towards your being,

28:59.503 --> 29:03.438
towards your personality. You are saints.

29:04.274 --> 29:07.175
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,

29:07.295 --> 29:10.198
I call it the character, the essence of character,

29:10.318 --> 29:12.926
is not a saint.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.057
So this purity has to be maintained.

29:20.177 --> 29:23.570
There cannot be any compromise on that.

29:23.690 --> 29:27.662
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

29:28.383 --> 29:31.867
If it works out,

29:32.047 --> 29:36.613
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

29:36.733 --> 29:39.894
nobody deceives oneself

29:40.539 --> 29:44.464
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

29:44.584 --> 29:47.800
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going to rise,

29:47.920 --> 29:50.440
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,

29:50.560 --> 29:53.083
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

29:53.203 --> 29:57.466
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things,

29:57.586 --> 30:01.583
your mind can be cleansed.

30:02.268 --> 30:05.786
And whenever such a thought comes in, you have to say,

30:05.906 --> 30:09.865
“not this, not this, not this.”

30:10.751 --> 30:14.842
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

30:16.073 --> 30:18.622
I know it's difficult,

30:18.742 --> 30:22.989
but if you can get realization why not this also?

30:25.127 --> 30:27.024
You all have to understand

30:27.144 --> 30:29.571
that there is no compromise on this.

30:29.691 --> 30:32.579
And a day may come, if you continue with it,

30:32.699 --> 30:35.049
you will be thrown away completely,

30:35.169 --> 30:39.549
just like any other devil is thrown out.

30:41.725 --> 30:44.511
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

30:44.631 --> 30:48.151
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

30:48.277 --> 30:49.909
You cannot ascend

30:50.029 --> 30:54.000
if there is any lurking thing within you.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.118
You will be dragged down, because that's your weakness,

30:57.238 --> 31:01.843
and you will become weaker, and weaker and weaker.

31:02.276 --> 31:05.957
Only question is “where is your attention?”

31:06.077 --> 31:11.380
Divert. Divert your attention.

31:13.863 --> 31:18.501
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

31:18.621 --> 31:24.883
and afterwards it will come automatically.

31:25.003 --> 31:28.654
You won't have to exert, you won't have to worry.

31:28.774 --> 31:31.664
On the contrary,

31:32.697 --> 31:36.769
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

31:38.664 --> 31:41.106
So much conditioning is there.

31:41.226 --> 31:44.719
We have played into the hands of conditioning,

31:44.985 --> 31:47.845
we have ruined ourselves.

31:47.965 --> 31:50.574
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,

31:50.694 --> 31:53.631
and the worst of all.

31:53.751 --> 31:57.235
It’s impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,

31:57.355 --> 31:59.246
unless and until you individually

31:59.397 --> 32:03.453
take up the responsibility of looking after it.

32:09.032 --> 32:12.353
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,

32:12.473 --> 32:17.074
and the most powerful chakra.

32:17.815 --> 32:25.632
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

32:27.791 --> 32:32.935
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your memory will fail.

32:33.055 --> 32:35.909
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin with,

32:36.029 --> 32:38.969
your wisdom will fail.

32:43.006 --> 32:45.941
You will have no sense of direction.

32:46.061 --> 32:49.815
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

32:49.935 --> 32:51.908
before they become forty years of age

32:52.028 --> 32:54.569
is because their Mooladharas are out.

32:54.689 --> 32:58.112
Most of the diseases which are incurable

32:58.232 --> 33:02.398
come because of weak Mooladharas,

33:04.395 --> 33:05.833
on the physical side.

33:05.953 --> 33:07.956
On the mental side,

33:08.076 --> 33:11.250
most of the mental problems we saw there,

33:11.370 --> 33:17.034
most, I would say ninety percent,

33:17.154 --> 33:19.578
are due to weak Mooladhara.

33:19.698 --> 33:22.699
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

33:22.819 --> 33:25.881
powerful Mooladhara,

33:26.001 --> 33:28.801
it doesn't get into trouble.

33:28.921 --> 33:31.839
Because you know there's a very strong hold

33:31.959 --> 33:35.524
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

33:35.644 --> 33:40.960
And when your mind goes off,

33:44.069 --> 33:47.115
you blame the brain.

33:47.323 --> 33:52.550
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

33:52.670 --> 33:56.693
So for physical safety and for your emotional safety also,

33:56.813 --> 34:04.804
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards Mooladhara.

34:06.557 --> 34:10.341
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should get married,

34:10.461 --> 34:13.547
and after marriage, after a few days, you find

34:13.667 --> 34:19.941
that your attention starts diverting to other problems of married life.

34:22.107 --> 34:26.724
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

34:27.451 --> 34:31.455
because the sensationalization

34:31.575 --> 34:34.898
has become the main theme of modern life.

34:35.018 --> 34:41.517
And you are tossed about on the rough sea

34:41.637 --> 34:45.802
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

34:45.922 --> 34:53.981
Media, books, ideas, everything,

34:54.354 --> 35:00.334
creates this horrible excitable temperament within you.

35:03.404 --> 35:05.606
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

35:05.726 --> 35:10.688
doesn't have any balance.

35:11.198 --> 35:13.356
Actually he's hypocritical,

35:13.476 --> 35:17.968
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

35:18.088 --> 35:21.300
So many complications take place with this.

35:21.433 --> 35:25.450
Before realization, forget the past.

35:26.222 --> 35:28.621
Whatever you have done, forget it.

35:28.741 --> 35:31.115
Just don't worry.

35:31.235 --> 35:33.152
But remember one thing,

35:33.272 --> 35:36.041
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

35:36.161 --> 35:39.287
So you have to look after it, you have to soothe it down,

35:39.407 --> 35:41.857
you have to bring it to normalcy.

35:41.977 --> 35:47.512
You have to make it a healthy,

35:49.035 --> 35:53.835
balanced center,

35:53.983 --> 36:00.144
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

36:03.475 --> 36:07.453
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

36:07.573 --> 36:12.141
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

36:13.170 --> 36:15.607
We talk of innocence,

36:15.727 --> 36:18.444
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

36:18.564 --> 36:23.234
we must be on the full watch,

36:23.354 --> 36:28.512
on the full alertness about our minds.

36:28.632 --> 36:31.269
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

36:31.389 --> 36:33.612
Where is this thief going?

36:33.732 --> 36:36.294
Is he trying to do some tricks?

36:36.414 --> 36:39.932
Is he up to some tricks? All right!

36:40.052 --> 36:43.882
You have to be alert, very alert.

36:44.492 --> 36:48.401
I’ve been thinking of talking about it since long.

36:48.521 --> 36:51.487
But now I have to tell you one thing.

36:51.612 --> 36:53.204
That you'll be exposed.

36:53.324 --> 36:55.994
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

36:56.114 --> 36:58.044
She'll expose you.

36:58.164 --> 37:01.021
You'll be exposed

37:01.141 --> 37:04.700
if you try to play tricks with Me.

37:04.859 --> 37:07.340
“With Me” means with your Kundalini.

37:07.460 --> 37:10.154
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

37:10.274 --> 37:12.884
you'll be exposed.

37:13.004 --> 37:16.245
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

37:17.132 --> 37:21.299
So please be careful, very careful about it,

37:21.419 --> 37:27.663
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

37:27.783 --> 37:30.800
and powerful.

37:30.942 --> 37:34.225
May God bless you!

37:41.656 --> 37:44.372
So our prayer should be that

37:44.492 --> 37:49.462
“Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong.”

37:49.582 --> 37:53.047
That's all. Let’s pray.

38:05.205 --> 38:07.920
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

38:08.040 --> 38:14.133
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader in England.

38:14.253 --> 38:16.011
Then he will pass it on to you.

38:16.131 --> 38:21.772
It should be done verbally. It should not be written down.

38:21.892 --> 38:24.955
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

38:25.075 --> 38:29.655
should come and see him every month sometime,

38:29.775 --> 38:34.027
and these things should be talked.

38:35.898 --> 38:39.756
Because it's a secret,

38:39.876 --> 38:41.239
not to be discussed openly.

38:41.359 --> 38:45.224
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

38:46.625 --> 38:49.808
It should not be written down anywhere.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.077
It should not be mentioned,

38:52.197 --> 38:55.641
but should be worked out by all of you,

38:55.761 --> 39:01.371
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of Shri Ganesha.

39:03.076 --> 39:07.076
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than for the men.

39:07.196 --> 39:11.414
Because men suffer much more than women do.

39:13.684 --> 39:17.525
And that's why women must be very careful.

39:17.645 --> 39:22.702
Develop very good relationships with your brothers.

39:25.879 --> 39:34.622
Unless and until you really establish your high character,

39:34.742 --> 39:38.434
men cannot be improved.

39:39.195 --> 39:41.770
You have seen in India women don’t like it

39:41.890 --> 39:44.172
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries to touch them.

39:44.292 --> 39:45.989
They don't like it.

39:46.109 --> 39:49.418
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves up,

39:49.538 --> 39:53.942
thousands of them, because they thought some

39:54.122 --> 39:58.304
other people may come and touch their body.

39:59.560 --> 40:07.205
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

40:07.876 --> 40:10.808
As if it is the body,

40:10.968 --> 40:14.169
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

40:19.363 --> 40:23.812
You all can be that, because you have become yoginis now.

40:23.932 --> 40:27.737
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing

40:27.857 --> 40:31.660
the power of their chastity.

40:32.590 --> 40:34.992
It's more for ladies here,

40:35.112 --> 40:40.259
that they should try to generate that feeling

40:40.379 --> 40:43.995
of nobility, of chastity,

40:44.115 --> 40:46.796
of holiness around them,

40:46.916 --> 40:52.200
so that the men themselves respect them

40:52.438 --> 40:56.972
and develop that feeling within themselves.

40:59.344 --> 41:01.904
Thank you very much.
