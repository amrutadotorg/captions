00:00:52.716 --> 00:00:56.227
So, this is how Mahamaya plays.

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:59.034
They had planned everything.

00:00:59.154 --> 00:01:03.514
They had all the arrangements made

00:01:03.634 --> 00:01:06.185
and the sari was missing.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:12.025
All right. So they came and told Me that the sari’s missing,

00:01:12.145 --> 00:01:13.779
so now what to do?

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.161
You can’t have puja without the sari, according to them.

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:21.372
So I said, “All right, let’s wait.

00:01:21.492 --> 00:01:23.706
If it arrives in time we’ll have it;

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:26.684
otherwise we can have it later.

00:01:26.841 --> 00:01:30.706
But I was least disturbed,

00:01:31.303 --> 00:01:33.892
least upset.

00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:38.344
Because I do not have a mental conception of it.

00:01:40.421 --> 00:01:41.970
But if you have a mental conception,

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.135
“Oh, we have programmed everything, arranged everything.

00:01:45.255 --> 00:01:48.348
We have done this and now it’s fizzling out.”

00:01:48.468 --> 00:01:54.270
Doesn’t matter. Nothing is fizzling out.

00:01:57.614 --> 00:01:59.683
But that is what we cannot do.

00:01:59.803 --> 00:02:01.938
Because you asked Me today, “What is Mahamaya?”

00:02:02.058 --> 00:02:05.236
This is what it is.

00:02:08.414 --> 00:02:11.976
You must learn to accept whatever comes your way.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:14.419
That’s one of the things.

00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:18.256
And here where we feel frustrated, angry,

00:02:18.376 --> 00:02:23.913
upset and spoil our joy, one of the things,

00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:27.509
because we make a mental projection.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:29.909
Mentally we calculate something.

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:31.249
This has to be.

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:36.741
And it’s really in a way a subtle ego feeling.

00:02:37.054 --> 00:02:43.393
Because I thought, “That’s what is destined. All right.

00:02:43.513 --> 00:02:46.133
We’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?”

00:02:46.253 --> 00:02:50.974
In any case I told Mr. Srivastava that I’ll be back

00:02:51.094 --> 00:02:53.072
only about two o’clock.

00:02:53.192 --> 00:02:54.432
He said, “Why not in the morning?”

00:02:54.552 --> 00:02:58.256
“I don’t think it will be feasible.”

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:04.682
So this is how you become avyagra.

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:09.235
Vyagra means person who is worried.

00:03:09.355 --> 00:03:12.625
The one who is not worried.

00:03:12.745 --> 00:03:15.211
So we worry because of two things.

00:03:15.331 --> 00:03:23.317
Firstly, we worry that what will happen in the future?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.237
Future doesn’t exist.

00:03:28.357 --> 00:03:29.863
If you have made up your mind

00:03:29.983 --> 00:03:31.628
that this should happen in the future,

00:03:31.748 --> 00:03:35.397
then you get upset. That’s one thing.

00:03:36.418 --> 00:03:39.000
But you have not made any mental picture,

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.318
you will see what comes on the scene.

00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:46.051
You’ll watch whatever appears.

00:03:46.171 --> 00:03:48.815
Then you’re not worried, because you’re anxious to see

00:03:48.935 --> 00:03:51.460
what’s going to happen.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.076
That’s one way, that you feel hurt, that you’re worried.

00:03:57.196 --> 00:04:00.807
Secondly you worry when you have built up a myth,

00:04:00.927 --> 00:04:07.889
picture of that “Oh, we’re going to have a puja now,

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.108
and we are not having it.”

00:04:10.228 --> 00:04:11.934
So you are upset.

00:04:12.054 --> 00:04:15.810
What difference does it make?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.149
And then you cannot enjoy My talk today and the puja tomorrow.

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.445
Because today you think it was going to be puja.

00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:28.102
We are all dressed up well. Very nice

00:04:28.278 --> 00:04:30.438
We spend so much time to get ready for the puja.

00:04:30.558 --> 00:04:34.737
All right, we’ll have it tomorrow. What does it matter?

00:04:36.369 --> 00:04:39.394
We really decorated ourselves well.

00:04:39.515 --> 00:04:41.192
We were all ready for the puja,

00:04:41.312 --> 00:04:42.965
we were sitting here for the puja,

00:04:43.085 --> 00:04:46.475
and now what has happened!

00:04:48.598 --> 00:04:53.069
I didn’t wear My sari for puja at all.

00:04:53.677 --> 00:04:56.892
I knew what was coming.

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.788
So, it’s all right to see you like this.

00:05:07.908 --> 00:05:10.211
Because normally in the puja, I never see you dressed like this,

00:05:10.331 --> 00:05:12.304
I’m busy with Myself.

00:05:12.424 --> 00:05:17.759
Now I can see you nicely dressed. I feel very happy about it.

00:05:20.664 --> 00:05:26.494
And these mental things are responsible for frustrating us.

00:05:26.845 --> 00:05:30.459
Like as I was telling you about money. Same thing happens.

00:05:30.579 --> 00:05:32.766
In India people come.

00:05:32.886 --> 00:05:35.919
They keep so much money for buying things.

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.738
You see, sometimes they come loaded just like

00:05:39.951 --> 00:05:41.800
what you call traders.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:43.826
The customs are so kind, I mean

00:05:43.946 --> 00:05:46.025
Sahaj Yogis have a free pass,

00:05:46.145 --> 00:05:48.456
whether in India, or in England or anywhere.

00:05:48.576 --> 00:05:50.484
And then they have a mental picture,

00:05:50.604 --> 00:05:55.206
“We’ll buy this.” All right? “And see so much we’ll spend.”

00:05:55.837 --> 00:05:58.037
And if they have to spend some money for something else,

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:02.334
they get upset because they have decided to spend so much.

00:06:02.496 --> 00:06:05.139
So then they might go to spend some money.

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:08.998
That’s also, you see how Mahamaya works, you see?

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.686
It has happened with all of you.

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:15.511
So they go and buy something.

00:06:15.631 --> 00:06:19.534
I’ll tell you Gavin bought once a image.

00:06:19.654 --> 00:06:23.047
I don’t know he paid about, I think 500 rupees

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:26.244
no how much have you paid about 4,000 or I don’t know.

00:06:26.364 --> 00:06:28.165
How many pounds you paid for that?

00:06:28.285 --> 00:06:32.031
Gavin: Forty pounds.

00:06:32.151 --> 00:06:34.186
Forty pounds. He paid forty pounds for that thing.

00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:37.836
I would not even pay five pounds for that.

00:06:37.956 --> 00:06:39.811
And I said, “What’s this? How did you buy?”

00:06:39.811 --> 00:06:44.605
“Oh, it’s a very nice thing, Mother. We got it in Agra.”

00:06:44.725 --> 00:06:47.076
I said, “It is from Nepal. If you buy it in Agra,

00:06:47.196 --> 00:06:52.251
I think it is very expensive and it’s such a waste.”

00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:54.938
But the worst was the vibrations were very bad.

00:06:55.058 --> 00:06:57.399
They thought they’ve bought something great.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:07:00.831
And the vibrations were very bad and I noticed it.

00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:02.613
So he said, “All right, Mother. I’ll keep it in Your house

00:07:02.733 --> 00:07:04.510
and You improve the vibrations.” I tried.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:07.497
It would not work out. I said, “Gavin, what to do now?

00:07:07.617 --> 00:07:12.469
You sink it in the Thames. I don’t know what.”

00:07:15.615 --> 00:07:17.993
And then luckily it happened C.P. said that,

00:07:18.113 --> 00:07:21.346
“I have to take some present of Buddha to Japan.”

00:07:21.466 --> 00:07:24.747
I said, “These Japanese exhibitors are good for nothing.

00:07:24.867 --> 00:07:27.291
No bhoot is going to trouble them.”

00:07:27.411 --> 00:07:29.412
So he said, “Can I buy something?”

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:32.303
I said, “Buddha’s things means it’s not easy to get here.”

00:07:32.423 --> 00:07:35.079
“But I have avlokhiteshwara. Would you like to take that?”

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.171
He said, “What is the price?”

00:07:36.291 --> 00:07:39.814
I said, “Forty pounds.”

00:07:40.687 --> 00:07:43.889
He said, “All right. All right. I’ll take it.

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:46.515
And he bought it for forty pounds.

00:07:46.635 --> 00:07:49.041
I said, “All right. Give it to the Japanese fellow.”

00:07:49.161 --> 00:07:52.811
He was a very nasty person. I said, “Good for him.”

00:07:54.762 --> 00:07:58.480
And I found it out that,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.422
you see because I knew that it will have some purpose somewhere.

00:08:03.797 --> 00:08:08.165
So this is how our mental images are so rigid

00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:13.377
that there’s no flexibility in our understanding.

00:08:13.497 --> 00:08:16.105
And if you start making it flexible then

00:08:16.247 --> 00:08:19.710
and this is very early stages when Gavin had gone to India,

00:08:19.830 --> 00:08:22.314
very early. Now he’s different.

00:08:22.434 --> 00:08:25.381
So if you become flexible,

00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:29.277
then what happens you see the joy of it.

00:08:29.397 --> 00:08:32.972
You see how things get adjusted. But if it is rigid,

00:08:33.092 --> 00:08:36.275
then you get caught up into your own rigidity.

00:08:36.395 --> 00:08:39.123
And you can never enjoy it,

00:08:39.243 --> 00:08:44.169
because there’s no movement for the Mahamaya power.

00:08:44.324 --> 00:08:46.565
And that’s how then you feel frustrated.

00:08:46.685 --> 00:08:49.407
You see it is all your own creation.

00:08:49.527 --> 00:08:53.440
The mental projection is your creation,

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:59.383
and also the destruction is your creation.

00:08:59.958 --> 00:09:04.052
Nobody is responsible for that. You are responsible.

00:09:05.582 --> 00:09:08.487
But who does that is Mahamaya,

00:09:08.607 --> 00:09:12.392
“Sankalpa vikalpa karo”, you do decide something.

00:09:12.512 --> 00:09:16.637
You say, “Now today I will go to Birmingham.

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:18.619
I have to go to Birmingham.

00:09:18.739 --> 00:09:24.064
I can’t come for a meditation. I have to.”

00:09:24.184 --> 00:09:25.561
After some time you will find

00:09:25.681 --> 00:09:28.859
that it’s impossible to do something,

00:09:28.979 --> 00:09:32.410
but to do what is needed for Sahaj Yoga.

00:09:32.530 --> 00:09:34.287
Because whenever you will try to do something,

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:39.089
you will find it will frustrate you, it will upset you.

00:09:39.209 --> 00:09:42.945
If not, then it will make you realize

00:09:43.065 --> 00:09:46.192
what is important, what you’ve missed.

00:09:47.406 --> 00:09:51.666
Sometimes you get lost on the way.

00:09:51.786 --> 00:09:54.947
You think that, “Oh God. We have lost the way.

00:09:55.067 --> 00:09:58.178
What to do? Now where to go?”

00:10:01.275 --> 00:10:03.894
If I was you, I would say, “All right.

00:10:04.014 --> 00:10:06.546
We’ve lost the way. Must be to find something else.”

00:10:06.666 --> 00:10:10.363
And there I find something else which I’ve been looking for,

00:10:10.483 --> 00:10:16.443
for days together. I just see that there.

00:10:19.489 --> 00:10:27.898
So if you trust your joy giving quality of your Spirit,

00:10:29.473 --> 00:10:32.660
that you’re not going to lose that quality of the Spirit,

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:35.232
at any cost.

00:10:35.948 --> 00:10:41.102
Then that acts as a guide

00:10:41.643 --> 00:10:47.694
and you understand the flexibility

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:51.683
of all these worldly, transitory things.

00:10:52.724 --> 00:10:54.676
They are all changeable,

00:10:54.796 --> 00:10:59.416
only you cannot change because you are the Spirit.

00:11:02.812 --> 00:11:05.758
Today I wanted to talk about Mooladhara,

00:11:05.878 --> 00:11:10.058
which is very important subject.

00:11:12.113 --> 00:11:16.412
I think I have talked about it many a times.

00:11:16.532 --> 00:11:20.705
But in the West I must say,

00:11:20.825 --> 00:11:28.392
because of our wrong attitudes

00:11:32.175 --> 00:11:38.379
and the acceptance of wrong mental projections

00:11:38.499 --> 00:11:42.326
of other people who are very dominating,

00:11:43.262 --> 00:11:49.566
we have very much ruined our Mooladhara.

00:11:51.722 --> 00:11:55.585
Despite the fact that Kundalini has risen

00:11:55.705 --> 00:12:00.624
with whatever weaker power that Mooladhara had,

00:12:00.756 --> 00:12:04.158
and has sustained itself,

00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:10.140
we must know that we can always fall a trap

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:19.556
to our different bifurcations which we had created before.

00:12:22.011 --> 00:12:25.788
It's a very serious matter

00:12:25.908 --> 00:12:32.302
that the Mooladhara chakra has been really shattered,

00:12:32.464 --> 00:12:36.868
and we have created pathways

00:12:36.988 --> 00:12:40.317
into which our attention can go

00:12:40.437 --> 00:12:44.044
if we are not very careful.

00:12:45.592 --> 00:12:49.365
Now supposing if somebody is a dishonest person,

00:12:49.485 --> 00:12:52.958
or a miserly person, or money oriented,

00:12:53.078 --> 00:12:59.083
it is very gross and you can see it so clearly.

00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:02.495
You see yourself and you get shocked how,

00:13:02.622 --> 00:13:06.740
“Why did I say such a thing? Why did I do such a thing?”

00:13:10.373 --> 00:13:17.809
But when it comes to the left side nonsense,

00:13:17.929 --> 00:13:20.681
sin against the Mother,

00:13:23.104 --> 00:13:28.960
it's a secretive action

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:33.007
that's only between you and yourself.

00:13:33.825 --> 00:13:38.989
Nobody knows what goes on in your mind, except for you.

00:13:39.607 --> 00:13:43.799
Nobody knows what you are going to do

00:13:44.807 --> 00:13:51.424
next moment in your privacy when you are alone.

00:13:52.507 --> 00:13:56.702
Nobody can look into you except for your Mother.

00:13:56.822 --> 00:14:00.127
I also only feel your Mooladharas.

00:14:00.247 --> 00:14:03.452
To be very frank with you,

00:14:03.572 --> 00:14:08.762
that's one center I find it difficult to feel Myself.

00:14:08.882 --> 00:14:16.649
The reason is, I have a very, very strong Mooladhara,

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:24.328
which is not so sensitive, I would say.

00:14:25.133 --> 00:14:26.726
It is not bothered.

00:14:26.852 --> 00:14:31.174
The attention of My Mooladhara doesn't go

00:14:31.294 --> 00:14:34.879
near any other Mooladhara. It just recedes back,

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.103
that's the action it plays all the time.

00:14:37.223 --> 00:14:41.186
So I also, unless and until it is very badly off,

00:14:41.306 --> 00:14:43.753
I mean the person is very close to Me,

00:14:43.873 --> 00:14:45.973
then I feel the Mooladhara very strongly.

00:14:46.093 --> 00:14:48.882
But still I can?

00:14:49.002 --> 00:14:53.556
Supposing you give Me something, that thing is used by you,

00:14:53.676 --> 00:14:57.029
immediately I can feel it.

00:14:57.661 --> 00:15:03.311
So the correction of Mooladhara entirely depends on you.

00:15:03.431 --> 00:15:07.112
And without a strong Mooladhara you cannot rise high,

00:15:07.232 --> 00:15:09.569
do what you like.

00:15:12.025 --> 00:15:16.653
Now for people who are Indian,

00:15:16.773 --> 00:15:20.438
who have respected their Mooladharas,

00:15:20.558 --> 00:15:23.379
there are so many methods and ways given

00:15:23.499 --> 00:15:30.562
how to raise the power of Mooladhara.

00:15:30.682 --> 00:15:34.429
But that won't work out with the Western people,

00:15:34.549 --> 00:15:38.169
because it's a damaged one.

00:15:38.289 --> 00:15:42.036
It's one which is a shattered one,

00:15:42.156 --> 00:15:45.712
and which does not work on the physical side of the Mooladhara,

00:15:45.832 --> 00:15:49.909
but on the emotional side as we call the “Mana”,

00:15:50.029 --> 00:15:53.683
the left side.

00:15:55.597 --> 00:16:01.091
So, even you may not talk in that way,

00:16:01.211 --> 00:16:06.325
but your mind is still in that realm.

00:16:06.885 --> 00:16:10.911
And you still think on that realm.

00:16:11.031 --> 00:16:15.995
Even mentally, you are in it.

00:16:17.265 --> 00:16:21.086
Or you are seeing things,

00:16:21.206 --> 00:16:24.103
wanting to see such things,

00:16:24.223 --> 00:16:27.541
wanting to enjoy such things.

00:16:27.661 --> 00:16:31.821
That lurking attraction is still there,

00:16:31.941 --> 00:16:35.141
your Mooladhara cannot strengthen.

00:16:36.825 --> 00:16:42.554
And we have to realize that I'm talking to Western people.

00:16:42.674 --> 00:16:47.402
I would not say the same to the people from India.

00:16:48.805 --> 00:16:52.981
So now we have to work out much harder.

00:16:53.101 --> 00:16:59.528
To be on the watch-out, to deal with yourself.

00:16:59.648 --> 00:17:05.746
And it is more a mental activity.

00:17:08.195 --> 00:17:12.342
“Mental” meaning I mean the emotional side.

00:17:12.462 --> 00:17:15.268
You have to watch your mind.

00:17:15.388 --> 00:17:20.041
In English, it's a very funny word “mind” is. But “Mana”,

00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:27.745
through which we cater to our emotional side, to our desires.

00:17:29.597 --> 00:17:32.098
Where is it going?

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.258
Where is this movement of our mind?

00:17:35.378 --> 00:17:38.029
What is it doing?

00:17:38.149 --> 00:17:40.891
You have to stand against your mind,

00:17:41.011 --> 00:17:43.731
stand against your desires,

00:17:43.851 --> 00:17:45.911
or you can face it

00:17:46.031 --> 00:17:51.501
and see for yourself clearly what's happening.

00:17:52.439 --> 00:17:55.933
It's for you to decide.

00:17:56.071 --> 00:18:00.467
Nobody is going to correct you on this point.

00:18:00.587 --> 00:18:03.256
I know you people have been confessing to Me.

00:18:03.376 --> 00:18:05.599
I never read your letters, to be very frank.

00:18:05.719 --> 00:18:08.574
Whatever letters you sent, I would not read it.

00:18:08.694 --> 00:18:10.531
Whatever confessions you have made,

00:18:10.651 --> 00:18:13.051
I burnt all those letters.

00:18:13.171 --> 00:18:17.028
I haven't got any idea as to what you did.

00:18:17.148 --> 00:18:19.330
Nor do I want to know about it.

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:22.891
That's not My concern.

00:18:23.011 --> 00:18:27.178
My concern is that now

00:18:27.298 --> 00:18:34.938
you do not dwell upon the same ideas,

00:18:35.931 --> 00:18:39.807
on the same level,

00:18:39.927 --> 00:18:44.408
or on any level whatsoever, we can say.

00:18:46.581 --> 00:18:50.611
It is in thoughtless awareness you can combat

00:18:50.731 --> 00:18:53.805
the thoughts that come to you

00:18:53.925 --> 00:18:56.293
from wrong type of Mooladhara.

00:18:56.413 --> 00:19:00.934
Maybe some of you have got bhoots on your Mooladhara.

00:19:01.967 --> 00:19:07.566
And we have some physical treatment for such bhoots also,

00:19:08.905 --> 00:19:12.300
which I'll tell to Gavin sometime,

00:19:12.420 --> 00:19:14.659
which you can ask.

00:19:14.779 --> 00:19:16.552
But you cannot always say that,

00:19:16.672 --> 00:19:19.252
“It is a bhoot and I'm all right. I'm away from the bhoot.”

00:19:19.372 --> 00:19:22.191
You are not. Whenever you say, “I have a bhoot,”

00:19:22.318 --> 00:19:26.842
means you yourself you’re siding with the bhoot.

00:19:31.789 --> 00:19:40.166
You see a person as a Sakshi.

00:19:40.286 --> 00:19:43.892
That means you see that person

00:19:44.012 --> 00:19:48.424
but you do not get a reaction,

00:19:48.544 --> 00:19:55.175
which is killer of joy.

00:19:57.484 --> 00:20:03.141
You yourself can feel your Mooladharas very well.

00:20:03.261 --> 00:20:11.179
You can feel it on your fingertips also.

00:20:11.352 --> 00:20:14.487
And be alert about it.

00:20:14.607 --> 00:20:18.462
If you want to be kind to yourself,

00:20:18.644 --> 00:20:24.538
know that you have to divert your attention

00:20:24.658 --> 00:20:27.745
towards a sane married life.

00:20:27.865 --> 00:20:31.867
But also that should not be too much.

00:20:31.987 --> 00:20:34.845
Because what I have learnt now,

00:20:34.965 --> 00:20:38.657
that in the West people have devised methods

00:20:38.825 --> 00:20:41.186
of transferring their attention

00:20:41.306 --> 00:20:45.097
from one person to another.

00:20:45.418 --> 00:20:49.070
Mental acrobatics of different type

00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:54.918
they have devised to destroy their pure attention.

00:20:55.038 --> 00:20:59.291
Don’t play onto these.

00:21:04.057 --> 00:21:08.058
There are so many other things by which

00:21:08.178 --> 00:21:12.280
we express that we are still under the trap

00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.234
of a bad Mooladhara.

00:21:14.354 --> 00:21:16.669
The way you dress up, the way you walk,

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:20.262
the way you sit, the way you talk,

00:21:20.382 --> 00:21:31.603
the way you behave, to impress other people.

00:21:33.077 --> 00:21:38.402
I am to be impressed by other people in Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:21:38.522 --> 00:21:41.554
The only impression that should really work

00:21:41.674 --> 00:21:48.093
is the height of ascent that others have achieved.

00:21:50.119 --> 00:21:52.672
You can do it; it's not difficult.

00:21:52.792 --> 00:21:56.413
When the Kundalini can rise with all such shattered

00:21:56.533 --> 00:22:01.242
Mooladharas, I'm sure you can cure your Mooladhara completely.

00:22:01.377 --> 00:22:05.624
But your question is first of all

00:22:05.744 --> 00:22:08.421
of strengthening the Mooladhara,

00:22:08.541 --> 00:22:14.246
for which I think you all have to go into a kind of tapasya.

00:22:15.407 --> 00:22:17.784
That's why I say sometimes

00:22:17.904 --> 00:22:22.116
that the Western people should take to less of meat,

00:22:22.236 --> 00:22:26.944
especially the red meats and beefs,

00:22:27.064 --> 00:22:31.831
and horses, and dogs

00:22:33.885 --> 00:22:38.039
and I don't know what else you eat.

00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:45.011
Take more to vegetarian food.

00:22:45.131 --> 00:22:48.651
I'm not saying vegetarianism, you understand that.

00:22:48.771 --> 00:22:50.347
Take more to things

00:22:50.467 --> 00:22:54.192
which do not give you so much heat in the body.

00:22:55.772 --> 00:22:59.845
Even fish is very [inaudible].

00:23:00.704 --> 00:23:04.854
So take to a life which is in a way ascetic,

00:23:04.974 --> 00:23:10.515
but don't take to these horrible health foods also.

00:23:10.651 --> 00:23:13.015
I can't tolerate them I tell you.

00:23:13.135 --> 00:23:16.364
They're not meant for human beings, but for animals I think.

00:23:16.484 --> 00:23:21.132
They churn your stomach completely, and it's horrible.

00:23:21.252 --> 00:23:25.737
This Country Store thing I took once and I said “had enough of it!”

00:23:25.999 --> 00:23:29.731
Country Store - the whole country went into My stomach.

00:23:33.935 --> 00:23:36.471
So for you people,

00:23:36.622 --> 00:23:38.854
(You have to go?)

00:23:39.404 --> 00:23:48.263
Those who are suffering from Mooladhara must know

00:23:48.421 --> 00:23:53.848
that food does make a difference

00:23:53.968 --> 00:23:57.758
in the powers of Mooladhara.

00:23:58.382 --> 00:24:02.480
So if you have to get it cured, first of all

00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.136
you have to soothe it down, it is over-excited,

00:24:06.256 --> 00:24:08.880
over-excited.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.559
Any man you touch, any woman you touch,

00:24:11.679 --> 00:24:13.252
any woman you look at ...

00:24:13.372 --> 00:24:16.876
I just don't understand, it's worse than monkeys.

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.333
Horrible.

00:24:19.453 --> 00:24:22.714
You have to soothe it down, cool it down,

00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:28.332
so that Ganesha bestows His blessings upon your Mooladhara.

00:24:28.452 --> 00:24:31.095
There's no grace.

00:24:31.215 --> 00:24:34.506
But it's not so outside that I can say that,

00:24:34.626 --> 00:24:37.651
“you must respect yourself.”

00:24:37.771 --> 00:24:41.380
It cannot work out with those words I know.

00:24:45.997 --> 00:24:50.024
You have to sit down,

00:24:50.144 --> 00:24:56.154
do meditation and try to soothe it down.

00:24:59.041 --> 00:25:00.766
I'll discuss with Gavin and I’ll tell him

00:25:00.886 --> 00:25:02.285
what things can be done about it,

00:25:02.405 --> 00:25:06.249
because I can't tell you in the open like this.

00:25:06.369 --> 00:25:10.418
But still this is all physical.

00:25:10.538 --> 00:25:15.516
Mentally you must be on the watch

00:25:15.636 --> 00:25:20.047
to see where does this mind go - to dirty things.

00:25:20.189 --> 00:25:25.085
Why does it always go to this sensation?

00:25:25.591 --> 00:25:32.448
See the birds, see the flowers, see the nature,

00:25:32.568 --> 00:25:38.274
see the beautiful people, just see them.

00:25:40.196 --> 00:25:42.398
Another horrible thing in the West

00:25:42.518 --> 00:25:44.987
is that the women must expose their body

00:25:45.107 --> 00:25:47.388
to get men excited.

00:25:47.508 --> 00:25:49.446
Men do the same I think.

00:25:49.566 --> 00:25:51.215
They always try to excite each other

00:25:51.335 --> 00:25:55.157
and live in a stupid excitement.

00:25:58.348 --> 00:26:03.407
You have to expose beautiful things, like flowers,

00:26:03.527 --> 00:26:06.374
beautiful ornaments.

00:26:06.494 --> 00:26:11.388
All right? But you're not a thing!

00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:23.220
It's your private property.

00:26:23.753 --> 00:26:28.064
You don't put all your gold on the streets, do you?

00:26:28.184 --> 00:26:31.312
Better try that, sometimes.

00:26:31.432 --> 00:26:34.861
You will mind people plundering your gold,

00:26:34.981 --> 00:26:38.561
but you don't mind your chastity being plundered.

00:26:38.681 --> 00:26:42.467
Everyone looking at you with dirty eyes.

00:26:42.587 --> 00:26:44.489
You don't feel insulted?

00:26:44.609 --> 00:26:48.389
Because ego is a dirty stuff. It does not mind.

00:26:48.509 --> 00:26:52.862
It feels happy that people are watching you.

00:26:55.417 --> 00:26:57.250
They are plundering you.

00:26:57.370 --> 00:27:00.849
They are looting your chastity.

00:27:05.624 --> 00:27:09.044
But Sahaja Yogis are not like that.

00:27:09.164 --> 00:27:13.686
But still I must say you must cleanse your hearts,

00:27:13.806 --> 00:27:20.028
cleanse your minds, take yourself out of it.

00:27:25.083 --> 00:27:29.519
The minds are very funnily placed,

00:27:29.639 --> 00:27:33.286
and that's why the greatest complications there are

00:27:33.406 --> 00:27:36.573
in the brains of people.

00:27:36.693 --> 00:27:39.879
They are very confused,

00:27:39.999 --> 00:27:43.589
very confused people.

00:27:43.922 --> 00:27:47.035
Because there is no wisdom in this kind of life.

00:27:47.155 --> 00:27:52.208
You become just a sex-oriented personality.

00:27:53.204 --> 00:27:56.180
It is actually just the other way round.

00:27:56.300 --> 00:28:00.040
If you are money-oriented, you want to preserve money.

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.303
If you are possession-oriented you want to preserve it.

00:28:03.423 --> 00:28:06.516
If you get one little antique piece you want to preserve it.

00:28:06.636 --> 00:28:09.075
And why not this property of yours

00:28:09.195 --> 00:28:10.815
which is the highest of all,

00:28:10.935 --> 00:28:14.739
to be preserved, to be adorned,

00:28:14.859 --> 00:28:17.681
to be worshipped?

00:28:22.068 --> 00:28:25.034
I'm quite worried on that point

00:28:25.154 --> 00:28:31.477
that secretly people are indulging into such things.

00:28:31.597 --> 00:28:33.646
And they’re hypocritical sometimes,

00:28:33.766 --> 00:28:35.949
they don't mind being hypocritical about it.

00:28:36.069 --> 00:28:38.612
They are Sahaja Yogis, all right,

00:28:38.732 --> 00:28:41.351
but in this matter they think they can go about

00:28:41.471 --> 00:28:44.213
the way they like. And sometimes some of them say that

00:28:44.333 --> 00:28:48.281
“Mother has said it’s all right.” I never said so!

00:28:48.401 --> 00:28:52.569
There's one point I cannot compromise is this.

00:28:53.848 --> 00:28:56.675
You must have a chaste outlook towards yourself,

00:28:56.795 --> 00:28:59.383
towards your life, towards your being,

00:28:59.503 --> 00:29:03.438
towards your personality. You are saints.

00:29:04.274 --> 00:29:07.175
And if a saint doesn't have a good character,

00:29:07.295 --> 00:29:10.198
I call it the character, the essence of character,

00:29:10.318 --> 00:29:12.926
is not a saint.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:20.057
So this purity has to be maintained.

00:29:20.177 --> 00:29:23.570
There cannot be any compromise on that.

00:29:23.690 --> 00:29:27.662
You cannot hit at the roots of everything.

00:29:28.383 --> 00:29:31.867
If it works out,

00:29:32.047 --> 00:29:36.613
in a collective way, nobody cheats oneself,

00:29:36.733 --> 00:29:39.894
nobody deceives oneself

00:29:40.539 --> 00:29:44.464
and put the mind into right track of ascent.

00:29:44.584 --> 00:29:47.800
Thinking about the ascent, how you are going to rise,

00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.440
thinking of the moments when you had the joys,

00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:53.083
thinking of the day where you met Me first,

00:29:53.203 --> 00:29:57.466
thinking of all the other beautiful and holy things,

00:29:57.586 --> 00:30:01.583
your mind can be cleansed.

00:30:02.268 --> 00:30:05.786
And whenever such a thought comes in, you have to say,

00:30:05.906 --> 00:30:09.865
“not this, not this, not this.”

00:30:10.751 --> 00:30:14.842
It's more mental than physical, I tell you.

00:30:16.073 --> 00:30:18.622
I know it's difficult,

00:30:18.742 --> 00:30:22.989
but if you can get realization why not this also?

00:30:25.127 --> 00:30:27.024
You all have to understand

00:30:27.144 --> 00:30:29.571
that there is no compromise on this.

00:30:29.691 --> 00:30:32.579
And a day may come, if you continue with it,

00:30:32.699 --> 00:30:35.049
you will be thrown away completely,

00:30:35.169 --> 00:30:39.549
just like any other devil is thrown out.

00:30:41.725 --> 00:30:44.511
So there is no compromise. Tell yourself,

00:30:44.631 --> 00:30:48.151
don't deceive yourself, don't cheat yourself.

00:30:48.277 --> 00:30:49.909
You cannot ascend

00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:54.000
if there is any lurking thing within you.

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:57.118
You will be dragged down, because that's your weakness,

00:30:57.238 --> 00:31:01.843
and you will become weaker, and weaker and weaker.

00:31:02.276 --> 00:31:05.957
Only question is “where is your attention?”

00:31:06.077 --> 00:31:11.380
Divert. Divert your attention.

00:31:13.863 --> 00:31:18.501
First you will need some exercise, some effort,

00:31:18.621 --> 00:31:24.883
and afterwards it will come automatically.

00:31:25.003 --> 00:31:28.654
You won't have to exert, you won't have to worry.

00:31:28.774 --> 00:31:31.664
On the contrary,

00:31:32.697 --> 00:31:36.769
it will become impossible how to be otherwise.

00:31:38.664 --> 00:31:41.106
So much conditioning is there.

00:31:41.226 --> 00:31:44.719
We have played into the hands of conditioning,

00:31:44.985 --> 00:31:47.845
we have ruined ourselves.

00:31:47.965 --> 00:31:50.574
This conditioning is the subtlest of all,

00:31:50.694 --> 00:31:53.631
and the worst of all.

00:31:53.751 --> 00:31:57.235
It’s impossible to combat in Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:57.355 --> 00:31:59.246
unless and until you individually

00:31:59.397 --> 00:32:03.453
take up the responsibility of looking after it.

00:32:09.032 --> 00:32:12.353
Mooladhara is one of the most delicate,

00:32:12.473 --> 00:32:17.074
and the most powerful chakra.

00:32:17.815 --> 00:32:25.632
It has so many folds and it has so many dimensions.

00:32:27.791 --> 00:32:32.935
If your Mooladhara is not all right, your memory will fail.

00:32:33.055 --> 00:32:35.909
If your Mooladhara is not all right, to begin with,

00:32:36.029 --> 00:32:38.969
your wisdom will fail.

00:32:43.006 --> 00:32:45.941
You will have no sense of direction.

00:32:46.061 --> 00:32:49.815
The insanity that is now crawling up in America

00:32:49.935 --> 00:32:51.908
before they become forty years of age

00:32:52.028 --> 00:32:54.569
is because their Mooladharas are out.

00:32:54.689 --> 00:32:58.112
Most of the diseases which are incurable

00:32:58.232 --> 00:33:02.398
come because of weak Mooladharas,

00:33:04.395 --> 00:33:05.833
on the physical side.

00:33:05.953 --> 00:33:07.956
On the mental side,

00:33:08.076 --> 00:33:11.250
most of the mental problems we saw there,

00:33:11.370 --> 00:33:17.034
most, I would say ninety percent,

00:33:17.154 --> 00:33:19.578
are due to weak Mooladhara.

00:33:19.698 --> 00:33:22.699
If a person has a strong Mooladhara,

00:33:22.819 --> 00:33:25.881
powerful Mooladhara,

00:33:26.001 --> 00:33:28.801
it doesn't get into trouble.

00:33:28.921 --> 00:33:31.839
Because you know there's a very strong hold

00:33:31.959 --> 00:33:35.524
of the Mooladhara in the back there.

00:33:35.644 --> 00:33:40.960
And when your mind goes off,

00:33:44.069 --> 00:33:47.115
you blame the brain.

00:33:47.323 --> 00:33:52.550
It's not the brain, mostly it is the Mooladhara.

00:33:52.670 --> 00:33:56.693
So for physical safety and for your emotional safety also,

00:33:56.813 --> 00:34:04.804
you have to have a sane type of attitude towards Mooladhara.

00:34:06.557 --> 00:34:10.341
That's why I'm very anxious that you all should get married,

00:34:10.461 --> 00:34:13.547
and after marriage, after a few days, you find

00:34:13.667 --> 00:34:19.941
that your attention starts diverting to other problems of married life.

00:34:22.107 --> 00:34:26.724
But not if you are not a Sahaja Yogi,

00:34:27.451 --> 00:34:31.455
because the sensationalization

00:34:31.575 --> 00:34:34.898
has become the main theme of modern life.

00:34:35.018 --> 00:34:41.517
And you are tossed about on the rough sea

00:34:41.637 --> 00:34:45.802
of all these deliberate actions of the people.

00:34:45.922 --> 00:34:53.981
Media, books, ideas, everything,

00:34:54.354 --> 00:35:00.334
creates this horrible excitable temperament within you.

00:35:03.404 --> 00:35:05.606
Such a person doesn't have any patience,

00:35:05.726 --> 00:35:10.688
doesn't have any balance.

00:35:11.198 --> 00:35:13.356
Actually he's hypocritical,

00:35:13.476 --> 00:35:17.968
and has a very bad left Vishuddhi.

00:35:18.088 --> 00:35:21.300
So many complications take place with this.

00:35:21.433 --> 00:35:25.450
Before realization, forget the past.

00:35:26.222 --> 00:35:28.621
Whatever you have done, forget it.

00:35:28.741 --> 00:35:31.115
Just don't worry.

00:35:31.235 --> 00:35:33.152
But remember one thing,

00:35:33.272 --> 00:35:36.041
that you have damaged your Mooladhara.

00:35:36.161 --> 00:35:39.287
So you have to look after it, you have to soothe it down,

00:35:39.407 --> 00:35:41.857
you have to bring it to normalcy.

00:35:41.977 --> 00:35:47.512
You have to make it a healthy,

00:35:49.035 --> 00:35:53.835
balanced center,

00:35:53.983 --> 00:36:00.144
so that Shri Ganesha can rule over it.

00:36:03.475 --> 00:36:07.453
Talking about Shri Ganesha,

00:36:07.573 --> 00:36:12.141
you know vibrations become too much for Me.

00:36:13.170 --> 00:36:15.607
We talk of innocence,

00:36:15.727 --> 00:36:18.444
but to awaken innocence within ourselves

00:36:18.564 --> 00:36:23.234
we must be on the full watch,

00:36:23.354 --> 00:36:28.512
on the full alertness about our minds.

00:36:28.632 --> 00:36:31.269
What is it thinking? Where is it going?

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:33.612
Where is this thief going?

00:36:33.732 --> 00:36:36.294
Is he trying to do some tricks?

00:36:36.414 --> 00:36:39.932
Is he up to some tricks? All right!

00:36:40.052 --> 00:36:43.882
You have to be alert, very alert.

00:36:44.492 --> 00:36:48.401
I’ve been thinking of talking about it since long.

00:36:48.521 --> 00:36:51.487
But now I have to tell you one thing.

00:36:51.612 --> 00:36:53.204
That you'll be exposed.

00:36:53.324 --> 00:36:55.994
That is another quality of Mahamaya.

00:36:56.114 --> 00:36:58.044
She'll expose you.

00:36:58.164 --> 00:37:01.021
You'll be exposed

00:37:01.141 --> 00:37:04.700
if you try to play tricks with Me.

00:37:04.859 --> 00:37:07.340
“With Me” means with your Kundalini.

00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:10.154
If you try to play tricks with your Kundalini,

00:37:10.274 --> 00:37:12.884
you'll be exposed.

00:37:13.004 --> 00:37:16.245
And you'll be ashamed of yourself.

00:37:17.132 --> 00:37:21.299
So please be careful, very careful about it,

00:37:21.419 --> 00:37:27.663
that you again make your Mooladhara very healthy,

00:37:27.783 --> 00:37:30.800
and powerful.

00:37:30.942 --> 00:37:34.225
May God bless you!

00:37:41.656 --> 00:37:44.372
So our prayer should be that

00:37:44.492 --> 00:37:49.462
“Let our Mooladhara be healthy and strong.”

00:37:49.582 --> 00:37:53.047
That's all. Let’s pray.

00:38:05.205 --> 00:38:07.920
There are certain exercises for Mooladhara.

00:38:08.040 --> 00:38:14.133
I will explain to Gavin who is your leader in England.

00:38:14.253 --> 00:38:16.011
Then he will pass it on to you.

00:38:16.131 --> 00:38:21.772
It should be done verbally. It should not be written down.

00:38:21.892 --> 00:38:24.955
The leaders of the ashrams and other places

00:38:25.075 --> 00:38:29.655
should come and see him every month sometime,

00:38:29.775 --> 00:38:34.027
and these things should be talked.

00:38:35.898 --> 00:38:39.756
Because it's a secret,

00:38:39.876 --> 00:38:41.239
not to be discussed openly.

00:38:41.359 --> 00:38:45.224
It's a secret, between you and yourself.

00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:49.808
It should not be written down anywhere.

00:38:49.928 --> 00:38:52.077
It should not be mentioned,

00:38:52.197 --> 00:38:55.641
but should be worked out by all of you,

00:38:55.761 --> 00:39:01.371
in such a way that you enjoy the bliss of Shri Ganesha.

00:39:03.076 --> 00:39:07.076
Is more for the ladies, I would say, than for the men.

00:39:07.196 --> 00:39:11.414
Because men suffer much more than women do.

00:39:13.684 --> 00:39:17.525
And that's why women must be very careful.

00:39:17.645 --> 00:39:22.702
Develop very good relationships with your brothers.

00:39:25.879 --> 00:39:34.622
Unless and until you really establish your high character,

00:39:34.742 --> 00:39:38.434
men cannot be improved.

00:39:39.195 --> 00:39:41.770
You have seen in India women don’t like it

00:39:41.890 --> 00:39:44.172
if anyone tries to look at them, or tries to touch them.

00:39:44.292 --> 00:39:45.989
They don't like it.

00:39:46.109 --> 00:39:49.418
Women have killed themselves, burnt themselves up,

00:39:49.538 --> 00:39:53.942
thousands of them, because they thought some

00:39:54.122 --> 00:39:58.304
other people may come and touch their body.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:07.205
It's so related to your Atma, to your Spirit.

00:40:07.876 --> 00:40:10.808
As if it is the body,

00:40:10.968 --> 00:40:14.169
innocence is the body of your Spirit.

00:40:19.363 --> 00:40:23.812
You all can be that, because you have become yoginis now.

00:40:23.932 --> 00:40:27.737
They were not yoginis, but they knew one thing

00:40:27.857 --> 00:40:31.660
the power of their chastity.

00:40:32.590 --> 00:40:34.992
It's more for ladies here,

00:40:35.112 --> 00:40:40.259
that they should try to generate that feeling

00:40:40.379 --> 00:40:43.995
of nobility, of chastity,

00:40:44.115 --> 00:40:46.796
of holiness around them,

00:40:46.916 --> 00:40:52.200
so that the men themselves respect them

00:40:52.438 --> 00:40:56.972
and develop that feeling within themselves.

00:40:59.344 --> 00:41:01.904
Thank you very much.
