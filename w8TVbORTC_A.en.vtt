00:00:08.091 --> 00:00:15.863
She wants to know how to
get detached from her emotions

00:00:15.943 --> 00:00:23.043
and how to establish purity in ourselves.

00:00:29.538 --> 00:00:37.126
Emotions. We should not confuse, you see.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:42.677
Emotions are pure,
nothing wrong with emotions.

00:00:42.757 --> 00:00:46.808
But the purity, that question comes in.

00:00:46.888 --> 00:00:52.212
When the emotions are not spontaneous,

00:00:52.292 --> 00:00:56.696
but are biased,

00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:59.607
like, because he’s your son
you have emotional feelings,

00:00:59.687 --> 00:01:02.927
because he’s your brother
you have emotional feelings,

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:06.077
because- Because!

00:01:06.157 --> 00:01:09.356
Then that’s not pure emotions.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:15.427
So, divine emotions are not attached

00:01:15.507 --> 00:01:17.886
like the sap of the tree, I always say.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:21.826
The sap of the tree rises,
it goes into the whole tree,

00:01:21.906 --> 00:01:27.475
he doesn’t settle down
into one flower or one leaf.

00:01:27.555 --> 00:01:33.012
If it does that then the whole
tree will die and the flower will die.

00:01:33.093 --> 00:01:34.147
All right?

00:01:34.227 --> 00:01:39.209
So the emotions that are
divine are always absolutely pure.

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:43.512
So emotions themselves detach you.

00:01:43.592 --> 00:01:47.025
If it’s true love you are
absolutely detached.

00:01:47.105 --> 00:01:52.768
Because true love means
you love everyone equally,

00:01:52.848 --> 00:01:58.435
may not be similar, but equally.

00:01:58.515 --> 00:02:05.692
Like the tree has different way- things,

00:02:05.772 --> 00:02:07.920
like it has got leaves, it has got roots,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.336
it has got flowers,

00:02:12.416 --> 00:02:14.017
it has got fruits.

00:02:14.097 --> 00:02:22.582
So whatever is needed for whatever
part is given with the equal attention.

00:02:22.662 --> 00:02:28.194
That’s how the true love should be,
that’s how the rue emotions should be.

00:02:28.274 --> 00:02:34.983
So, how to detach is best is
to try to do equally to everyone.

00:02:35.063 --> 00:02:38.813
Like now, somebody is your
husband, the relationship is different

00:02:38.893 --> 00:02:44.307
but give equal attention to your
husband as much as to your own child.

00:02:44.387 --> 00:02:53.702
Equal attention to other Sahaja
Yogis as much as to your own Mother.

00:02:53.782 --> 00:02:59.290
This is how you’ll get it.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.881
But, you see, somebody, say,

00:03:01.921 --> 00:03:06.384
romanticism now, it’s
ego, nonsense, ego it is.

00:03:06.464 --> 00:03:10.450
Romanticism is nothing but simple ego.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.882
It has nothing to do
with emotions I tell you.

00:03:12.962 --> 00:03:18.637
It is ego because you
start thinking you are the –

00:03:18.717 --> 00:03:21.907
what is, you are the Juliet.

00:03:21.987 --> 00:03:23.694
All right, I ‘m now the Juliet.

00:03:23.774 --> 00:03:28.819
So somebody has become the Romeo.

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:32.036
Now you are a Juliet so
he must be like Romeo?

00:03:32.116 --> 00:03:37.952
If he doesn’t like, behave
like Romeo then you feel hurt.

00:03:38.032 --> 00:03:41.071
So your romanticism is
finished then you start crying:

00:03:41.151 --> 00:03:43.781
“Why doesn’t he behave like Romeo?”

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:47.088
Neither you are Juliet nor he is Romeo.

00:03:47.168 --> 00:03:49.506
Both are imaginations of your ego.

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:53.930
And then your ego feels hurt,
then you feel very unhappy about it.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.225
So, some women, if the husband
doesn’t- you see, they will go on:

00:03:58.305 --> 00:04:02.123
“Stand up, sit down. Stand up, sit down!”
The husband gets, you see, confused.

00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:05.281
When she says: “Stand up!” he sits down.

00:04:05.361 --> 00:04:08.651
So she gets angry: “What do you mean?

00:04:08.731 --> 00:04:12.756
You have no sense, you are not fair to me.”

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:17.258
Same thing could happen to the man,
same could happen with the husband.

00:04:17.338 --> 00:04:21.960
So the equal attention to every relationship

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:28.154
in its full nurturing of that
relationship is complete emotions,

00:04:28.234 --> 00:04:32.933
the true divine emotions,
that’s what I have for all of you.

00:04:33.013 --> 00:04:36.072
Everyone is in my mind

00:04:36.152 --> 00:04:39.592
and everyone I nurture with full attention.

00:04:51.516 --> 00:04:55.147
All right?

00:04:55.227 --> 00:04:59.168
And also you must know one
thing very clearly which I know

00:04:59.248 --> 00:05:02.406
that the source of joy is your Self,

00:05:02.486 --> 00:05:06.148
nobody else can give
you joy. It’s only your Self!

00:05:06.228 --> 00:05:08.764
That your wife should give you the joy,

00:05:08.844 --> 00:05:11.113
your husband should give you the joy,

00:05:11.193 --> 00:05:15.410
your children should give you
the joy, is wrong expectation.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:16.760
They can never!

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.663
Because source is here, you see?

00:05:20.743 --> 00:05:25.462
If the lamp is supposed to give us the
light, we don’t expect light from the leaves.

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:28.418
But that’s what it is.

00:05:28.498 --> 00:05:31.157
It is a misconception.

00:05:31.237 --> 00:05:35.778
Joy can never come from others
it comes from within yourself

00:05:35.858 --> 00:05:38.614
and the Self which is God.

00:05:38.694 --> 00:05:42.893
So only from God and from
your Self you can have joy,

00:05:42.973 --> 00:05:46.454
not from anybody else.

00:05:46.534 --> 00:05:49.240
When they are Realized
souls, then also you feel their joy

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.428
because you can get it from their Self.

00:05:53.508 --> 00:06:03.276
Only from the Self you can get
the joy and not from anything else

00:06:03.356 --> 00:06:07.615
It’s a conditioning of the mind.

00:06:07.695 --> 00:06:11.813
I mean, you see, here everything
is so judgement I see the people

00:06:11.893 --> 00:06:15.980
and I talk to men and woman,
you see, and I am really amazed

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:21.315
how artificial they have become about
even emotional behaviour towards each other.

00:06:21.395 --> 00:06:24.156
Very artificial, just like, you see,

00:06:24.236 --> 00:06:28.248
French will put the fork like
this, English will put like this.

00:06:28.328 --> 00:06:32.163
Now, in a French company, if you
put it like this, they’ll laugh at you.

00:06:32.243 --> 00:06:35.813
If it is an English company, if you
put it like this, they’ll laugh at you.

00:06:35.893 --> 00:06:38.813
These norms they themselves have made,

00:06:38.893 --> 00:06:44.147
bound themselves with these
norms, in the same way, romanticism is.

00:06:44.227 --> 00:06:48.116
All of these norms have been made by
human beings and they are bound by it

00:06:48.196 --> 00:06:56.088
and they make themselves miserable.

00:06:56.168 --> 00:07:00.942
You are free people. You
are not bound by any norms.

00:07:07.269 --> 00:07:10.342
Done !
