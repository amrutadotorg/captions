00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.860
Yogi asks about taking of photos during Shri Mataji's talk.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.910
But when I am talking, one should not.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.750
You have to sing one song more, smaller one.

00:08:26.860 --> 00:08:31.810
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:45.920
As I told you yesterday, that truth is what it is.

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.790
It cannot be conceptualized, and

00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:00.850
cannot be felt at this human awareness.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:11.700
For that you have to become a subtler being that we call

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.830
as the spirit.

00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:26.700
Today I'm going to tell you about the nature of spirit.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.910
Spirit is the reflection of the Father, the God Almighty.

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:50.810
The seat of that is on top of fontanel bone area,

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.790
but He is reflected in our heart;

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.830
while Kundalini is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.910
the Primordial Mother.

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:32.780
So this spirit, when it is enlightened into our attention,

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:38.920
our attention becomes active:

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:53.910
in the sense that if you pay attention to something,

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:58.880
it doesn't act there, but on the contrary

00:10:59.850 --> 00:11:05.840
wherever you pay attention, that acts upon you.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:18.920
On the contrary an enlightened soul,

00:11:19.780 --> 00:11:23.770
even a glance of such a person

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:34.690
can manifest peace, joy in the other person.

00:11:56.870 --> 00:12:01.850
The spirit, when it starts showing through your central

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:06.770
nervous system, you develop a new dimension

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.780
on your nerves,

00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:27.750
by which you can feel your own centers,

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:30.780
that is self - knowledge,

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.780
and you can feel the centers of others.

00:12:44.690 --> 00:12:52.700
It is absolutely accurate sensation you get on your fingertips.

00:12:55.870 --> 00:13:02.720
If you know how to put these centers all right,

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:11.780
then you get physical, mental, emotional complete balance.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:27.750
The center is like this, and when we start using it on the right

00:13:27.810 --> 00:13:37.710
side or left side too much, then it becomes constricted.

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:48.720
Sometimes a certain shock can just break it,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:03.860
and then you develop maladies, physical and mental.

00:14:11.810 --> 00:14:15.710
But when the Kundalini passes through these centers

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:18.770
She puts them right and enlightens them, because

00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.820
She's now connected to the spirit.

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:43.910
So the spirit tells us what is wrong with us.

00:14:48.730 --> 00:14:53.680
This is the Last Judgment.

00:14:53.910 --> 00:14:59.720
Also this is the Resurrection Time.

00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:04.830
We are going to judge ourselves,

00:15:07.740 --> 00:15:11.740
and we are going to resurrect ourselves

00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:15.720
through Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:28.680
Spirit is the source of truth, absolute truth.

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:39.720
If you have ten children who are realized souls, and if you

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:44.910
tie up their eyes, and put somebody before him and ask

00:15:45.750 --> 00:15:52.700
what's wrong, then they will all put up one finger.

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:11.680
That means they all are saying that something wrong

00:16:11.770 --> 00:16:15.910
with the throat of the gentleman.

00:16:20.790 --> 00:16:24.710
And if you ask the gentleman, "Is something wrong with

00:16:24.770 --> 00:16:29.840
your throat?" he says, "Yes, but how do you know?".

00:16:39.790 --> 00:16:42.820
In the light of the spirit gradually you understand

00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:48.730
this divine Power, which is all-pervading.

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:06.800
And if you know how to work out this divine Power,

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:12.810
you can also raise the Kundalini of others

00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:24.870
and give them, others realization.

00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:30.870
Also you will know which man is truthful

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:34.910
and which man is not,

00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:44.720
because immediately as soon as you put fingers towards

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:51.850
such a person, you will feel terrible heat if he is a crook;

00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:08.690
because in your awareness you develop a new dimension

00:18:08.770 --> 00:18:13.860
called as collective consciousness.

00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:25.730
First you develop a state, what we call as nirvichar samadhi,

00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.900
meaning   thoughtless awareness.

00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:43.770
For example, therel s a nice carpet here and I look at it,

00:18:48.770 --> 00:18:52.690
and I start thinking about it.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.690
But after enlightenment you see something

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:00.730
and there is no thought;

00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:13.880
because thoughts come from the past or from the future,

00:19:20.680 --> 00:19:23.880
but in the present there is no thought.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:32.750
So when you see something, whatever joy is created by the

00:19:32.810 --> 00:19:41.780
artist starts pouring on you and absolutely soothes you down.

00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:56.820
Your stress, your worries all disappear,

00:19:58.860 --> 00:20:04.740
because spirit is the source of peace.

00:20:05.810 --> 00:20:10.730
There are many people who start talking about peace,

00:20:10.830 --> 00:20:15.830
but they have no peace within themselves.

00:20:17.890 --> 00:20:22.840
They also get Nobel Prizes in peace, but what's the use -

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:27.790
they have no peace within themselves.

00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:39.910
But it is like a wheel: when the wheel is moving

00:20:40.750 --> 00:20:45.810
and you are at the periphery, you are disturbed;

00:20:51.910 --> 00:20:59.710
but if you go to the axis of the wheel, it's peaceful.

00:21:01.900 --> 00:21:11.680
In the same way you, your state becomes that of an axis.

00:21:16.900 --> 00:21:21.750
Like if you are standing in the water, there are waves coming

00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:25.860
and you are afraid of the waves -

00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:34.760
like the thoughts, coming from the right and left,

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.700
future and past.

00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.840
But if you get into the boat,

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.760
then you are no more afraid of the waves.

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:00.880
But if you learn how to swim, you can get into the waves

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:06.840
and bring people with you back to the boat.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.710
This is the third, this is the second state where you arrive, is

00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:29.820
the doubtless awareness, nirvikalpa samadhi,

00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:39.780
where you become very knowledgeable.

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:52.700
The light of the spirit enlightens your brain.

00:22:54.820 --> 00:23:00.890
What we know through human awareness is very little,

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:09.840
but when the brain is enlightened you start discovering

00:23:10.710 --> 00:23:13.830
new things.

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:21.720
We have some scientists who have discovered lots of things

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:25.920
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.820
It gives a new dimension to your creativity.

00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.820
We have many artists, musicians who have become

00:23:38.890 --> 00:23:43.820
world - famous after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.800
Physically you feel all right; all incurable diseases

00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:02.800
can be cured, most of them can be cured with Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.780
Some people take more time, some less, but most of them

00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:20.850
are cured.

00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:33.680
But it is not meant for people who are frivolous,

00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:44.830
or people who do not want their realization.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:49.900
It is meant for people who seriously are seeking

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:54.850
honestly the truth.

00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:04.680
People who have been even spoilt by false gurus or for

00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:08.690
following some religions in the wrong way,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:11.880
all can be saved.

00:25:22.850 --> 00:25:28.820
In the light of the spirit you become your own master,

00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:36.800
because you see the truth.

00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.780
For the first time you feel this all-pervading Power

00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:45.720
which does all the living work;

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:59.680
and then if you know how to handle this great power,

00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:04.750
you can become masters.

00:26:09.830 --> 00:26:13.690
You become extremely dynamic, fearless,

00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:18.840
but at the same time very compassionate.

00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:29.820
And this has to happen to all of you.

00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:37.870
Only those who do not want, or those who are not destined,

00:26:45.830 --> 00:26:49.750
will not get it.

00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.810
But it is not a plastic growth, that you can create

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:58.780
thousand flowers of plastic -

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:07.870
it is reality,

00:27:08.710 --> 00:27:15.740
and so the becoming is important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:25.830
Above all,

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:33.890
your spirituality, your divinity start expressing itself

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:43.900
and you become automatically righteous,

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:52.730
and you enjoy your virtues.

00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.880
The greatest thing about Sahaja Yog today is that

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:10.740
it's a collective happening.

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.830
Before this, people had to cleanse themselves

00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:31.850
by going to Himalayas or hiding themselves in some caves.

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:41.890
They had to do lots of penances.

00:28:44.810 --> 00:28:48.870
But in Sahaja Yoga, collective work

00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:55.840
makes you absolutely perfect.

00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:05.790
It is like if My nail is broken then it will not grow -

00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.890
it has to be connected with the whole.

00:29:18.810 --> 00:29:21.810
Once you are connected to this divine Power,

00:29:22.870 --> 00:29:28.760
then you all become part and parcel of the whole.

00:29:34.760 --> 00:29:37.790
You are not only guided, but also very much protected

00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:41.870
and blessed.

00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:51.720
Specially it gives you joy.

00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:59.880
Joy cannot be expressed, cannot be described.

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:11.770
It doesn't have duality of happiness and unhappiness;

00:30:12.890 --> 00:30:16.830
it is absolute in its nature.

00:30:18.740 --> 00:30:22.830
It is just to be experienced,

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.840
and that is what will happen to you.

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:38.880
Today again if you have some questions,

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:42.910
I would like to answer; but again I have to tell you that

00:30:43.770 --> 00:30:48.850
I have not come here to take anything from you.

00:30:56.830 --> 00:31:03.840
So please ask Me a question, any question which is relevant.

00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:11.750
Thank you very much.

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:41.850
Can the energy Kundalini be activated forever?

00:31:45.890 --> 00:31:52.790
Yes, of course. Continuously.

00:32:02.740 --> 00:32:05.820
You have to know about it,

00:32:08.710 --> 00:32:12.720
for which you don't have to pay anything.

00:32:15.690 --> 00:32:21.690
All this knowledge is absolutely free.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:32.760
You cannot pay for the divine work.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:59.880
I would like to ask, why the things and events repeat again?

00:33:03.700 --> 00:33:08.860
They are all our mistakes, these are human mistakes.

00:33:14.900 --> 00:33:18.710
Human beings have to change,

00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:24.720
they have to be transformed.

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.740
The question was, whether the energy can be awaken

00:33:38.850 --> 00:33:41.850
by some exercise?

00:33:43.870 --> 00:33:46.850
No, it cannot be.

00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:54.770
It cannot be by any exercise, or by reading or by anything.

00:33:54.850 --> 00:33:57.770
It is a living process.

00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:01.750
Like the seed, you cannot force it to sprout.

00:34:01.810 --> 00:34:05.700
You have to put it into Mother Earth.

00:34:53.700 --> 00:34:57.700
Why some religions are afraid even of pronouncing

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:01.850
of the word "yoga"?

00:35:07.770 --> 00:35:09.770
They all have to be upset.

00:35:09.830 --> 00:35:13.840
All the religions are just making money.

00:35:25.890 --> 00:35:30.880
 Yoga   means  Union with the Divine.

00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:39.710
All scriptures have said that you have to be born again.

00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:46.740
Nobody is paying attention to that;

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.820
they are just busy collecting money.

00:36:04.690 --> 00:36:09.790
You was talking about rebirth of some energy,

00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:15.800
but the Bible is saying, that no one can please God

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:21.770
and Jesus Christ says, that we are born from Holy Spirit

00:36:22.730 --> 00:36:26.750
and not from our own energy...

00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:03.860
He has never said so.

00:37:10.890 --> 00:37:14.920
You better read your Bible again.

00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:20.790
Of course word of God is there, no doubt.

00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:23.770
Hello!

00:37:25.850 --> 00:37:29.830
I am quoting from the Bible in the name of Jesus Christ.

00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:33.710
Jesus Christ replied: Amen Amen I'm telling you,

00:37:33.880 --> 00:37:36.700
who was not born from the water and spirit,

00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:38.890
cannot enter to the Kingdom of God.

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:40.710
What is it?

00:37:40.850 --> 00:37:43.840
It is not - it is of course the word of God.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.810
Hello, listen, sit down. I'll tell you.

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:47.740
Sit down. I'll tell you what.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.690
It is, Christ has said that it is the word of God,

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.720
and I am using word of God alone. Sit down.

00:37:56.790 --> 00:37:59.850
Also He has said that  I'll send you the Holy Ghost.

00:37:59.910 --> 00:38:07.830
If I am the Holy Ghost, I am God also. Please be seated.

00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:09.840
If I am the Holy Ghost,

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:13.760
how will you recognise Me, as a Christian?

00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:17.800
How will you recognise Me?

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.690
I am the Holy Ghost.

00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:35.750
I have to say this, because if you bring Bible here,

00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:39.820
I'll have to tell you; because,

00:38:41.690 --> 00:38:44.810
because I give comfort -

00:38:45.760 --> 00:38:49.790
we have cured so many people in the whole world.

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.760
There are three doctors who have got M.D. in Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:05.690 --> 00:39:07.780
There are forty doctors in Russia

00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.830
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.760
And I am counselling you, I am telling you

00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:24.790
what Christ could not tell, because in three-and-a-half years

00:39:24.850 --> 00:39:27.870
He was killed.

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.880
They were the same people who were reading Bible

00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:43.740
and saying,  This is not our Saviour - and they killed Him.

00:39:48.810 --> 00:39:51.860
And the third thing is the redemption.

00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.860
Holy Ghost has to be a Redeemer, and that's what it is:

00:39:58.760 --> 00:40:03.680
I am giving you Realization.

00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.680
This time don't miss it.

00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:16.790
Three-and-a-half years they allowed Christ to live,

00:40:16.890 --> 00:40:22.700
and they are using His Bible when I'm here.

00:40:27.690 --> 00:40:30.860
When Christ was there, they were using the Old Testament

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:36.780
to decry Him, and talking about Moses.

00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:49.880
By reading Bible, if you people would have achieved

00:40:50.740 --> 00:40:54.920
anithing, you would have seen to it.

00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:04.840
I was Myself born in a Christian family.

00:41:07.830 --> 00:41:09.730
And do you know what Christians have done

00:41:09.810 --> 00:41:12.790
with this Bible?

00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.730
If you go to South America you'll be shocked.

00:41:18.810 --> 00:41:21.740
Billions and billions of Red Indians were killed by

00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:25.830
Christians showing them Bible.

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:36.750
In India they brought Bible in one hand

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.810
and a gun in the other.

00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:57.760
Don't miss it.

00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:59.900
The time has come for you to get your Realization,

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:03.830
to take your resurrection.

00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.770
You were born in a Christian religion,

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.780
so you believe in Bible; but those who are born in Islam,

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.790
they believe in Koran only.

00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:29.890
They think all the Christians will go to hell,

00:42:34.830 --> 00:42:40.890
and the Christians think that all the Muslims will go to hell.

00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:47.890
What about the Jews?

00:42:50.810 --> 00:42:54.810
When you have blinkers and when you put blinkers,

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.830
you do not see the unity of God.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.760
This has...

00:43:15.710 --> 00:43:19.800
Those people who read Koran, Bible, Gita, anything,

00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:24.710
they follow any religion, commit any sin.

00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:27.830
Are they righteous?

00:43:35.810 --> 00:43:37.790
Christ has asked you to be humble.

00:43:37.900 --> 00:43:39.810
Where are the Christians who are humble?

00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:44.810
I would like to see - they are so arrogant.

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:55.760
Christ went to the extreme of morality:

00:43:55.850 --> 00:44:00.720
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:44:11.690 --> 00:44:16.730
Let us see which Christians have that kind of eyes.

00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:25.840
Only the Sahaja yogis have those innocent eyes.

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:28.900
You all are to be born again, you should have

00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:33.790
an actualization of baptism.

00:44:38.830 --> 00:44:41.830
You should feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost out of

00:44:41.920 --> 00:44:45.890
your fontanel bone area.

00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:53.740
We have had enough of sermons and lectures

00:44:53.810 --> 00:44:56.760
and Bible-reading.

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:07.890
Let us read the book of reality, the book of reality.

00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:13.880
No blind faith is needed.

00:45:14.850 --> 00:45:21.700
You have to feel the all-pervading Power.

00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:28.750
You can prove it through Sahaja Yoga that Christ

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:33.810
was the Son of God -  you can prove it.

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.850
they cannot prove.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:42.850
Can they give Self-realization?

00:45:42.910 --> 00:45:44.880
(You better take another hall and give address there.

00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:48.880
No one wants you. Just throw him out.)

00:46:11.730 --> 00:46:17.750
You should not believe blindly into anything whatsoever.

00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:22.810
You must have the proof of everything.

00:46:24.730 --> 00:46:26.840
If you don't have the proof, why do you believe in Bible,

00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:32.700
why do you believe in Gita, why do you believe in Koran,

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.860
just blindly believing into it?

00:46:57.760 --> 00:47:02.780
Please I would like to ask you in the name of this lady.

00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:08.700
and she would like to tell you, what is the matter...

00:47:16.870 --> 00:47:21.830
I can treat her later on. We'll treat you, no doubt.

00:47:22.680 --> 00:47:27.770
It will take some time, madam? Wer ll treat you, all right?

00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:36.730
Just now I want to give Self-realization to all of them.

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:42.750
That is very important.

00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:47.850
They have come here to get their Self-realization.

00:47:57.820 --> 00:48:00.740
All right.

00:48:17.830 --> 00:48:23.860
(Ask them to give, give these boys some bandhans.)

00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:39.870
I had to say it, I'm sorry. I had to say -

00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:45.740
the time had come to say this, see, so I'm happy.

00:49:00.910 --> 00:49:02.920
Those who do not want to have Self-realization

00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:07.720
should please leave the hall.

00:49:10.770 --> 00:49:15.720
It is not civil to come to somebody else's meetings

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.760
and disturb it.

00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:28.870
It is a divine work which is going on, and you have

00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.740
no business to disturb.

00:49:36.910 --> 00:49:41.910
So people are paid for this kind of work, I know;

00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:53.810
but why not seek your benevolence?

00:49:58.860 --> 00:50:04.840
Why stick onto these ideas and get ruined forever?

00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:16.740
There is no wisdom in this kind of a blind faith.

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:25.850
Now so many Muslims and Jews worship Christ,

00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:33.840
because it's a proof for them.

00:50:34.840 --> 00:50:38.870
It is not because they go to church and listen to someone,

00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.840
and then accept something.

00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:56.860
If it is a proof, then as honest people you have to accept.

00:51:14.890 --> 00:51:16.750
They say in English,

00:51:16.810 --> 00:51:20.900
proof of the pudding is in the eating of it,

00:51:26.700 --> 00:51:30.820
not by talking or by reading something.

00:51:33.740 --> 00:51:37.750
If you are hungry, you will get it;

00:51:39.690 --> 00:51:44.780
not those who are living on words and books.

00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:55.730
One poet has said in India - his name was Kabira - he said,

00:51:55.830 --> 00:52:04.820
by reading too much, even the educated have become stupid.

00:52:35.740 --> 00:52:40.690
Now, as you know, there are two forces within us:

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:41.910
what we call the left sympathetic and

00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:45.750
the right sympathetic nervous system.

00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:58.890
They work when we are in emergencies.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:04.770
But the third one is called as the parasympathetic,

00:53:08.790 --> 00:53:12.770
which supplies the energy to bring the whole system

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:15.820
into balance.

00:53:20.750 --> 00:53:27.870
Actually the left side is the power of desire,

00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:36.790
and the right side is the power of action.

00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:44.760
Christ could not tell all these things, they crucified Him.

00:53:51.850 --> 00:53:58.800
This is the problem, that His work has to be completed.

00:54:03.880 --> 00:54:13.900
Now we will be using our left power of desire,

00:54:15.790 --> 00:54:20.710
expressing with your hand like this.

00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:35.770
But there are three conditions which you must have:

00:54:38.770 --> 00:54:43.920
that if you have pure desire to get your realization,

00:54:50.780 --> 00:54:57.870
then be sure that you all will get your Self-realization.

00:55:07.770 --> 00:55:10.860
You should now have no diffidence.

00:55:23.700 --> 00:55:25.800
Let it be, doesn't matter. They are useless people, you see;

00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:29.900
they are paid by someone.

00:55:30.830 --> 00:55:33.900
You forget it.

00:55:34.820 --> 00:55:39.850
So there are three conditions: first is, you should be

00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:46.720
confident that you will all get your Self-realization.

00:55:51.790 --> 00:55:58.710
All right. Then the second condition is that you are

00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.910
not to feel guilty at all.

00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:09.870
You have to forget the past.

00:56:10.870 --> 00:56:14.780
You have to be in the present.

00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:21.840
If you feel guilty, then you catch this center very badly,

00:56:25.800 --> 00:56:29.730
and as a result you develop even physical problems,

00:56:29.830 --> 00:56:32.790
apart from mental torture.

00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:45.730
You develop angina, spondylitis,

00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:50.820
and many diseases from the lethargic organs.

00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:06.850
All right. The third condition is that you have to forgive

00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:08.720
everyone,

00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.910
everyone in general;

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:23.830
not to think about anyone who has troubled you.

00:57:30.720 --> 00:57:34.870
Even the gentleman who tried to disturb you: forgive him,

00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:41.920
just forgive.

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:44.900
Because whether you forgive or don't forgive,

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:48.690
you don't do anything.

00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:55.690
But if you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

00:58:01.830 --> 00:58:05.840
So logically you must forgive.

00:58:06.780 --> 00:58:09.920
Actually you don  t do anything.

00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:12.880
But why should we torture ourselves for others

00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:17.760
when they are enjoying themselves?

00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:29.710
And done t consider yourselves as anything low.

00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:34.800
Now you are a human being, and there's

00:58:35.780 --> 00:58:40.810
a last breakthrough that you have to achieve,

00:58:43.890 --> 00:58:49.710
which is the actualization of your baptism.

00:58:55.740 --> 00:58:58.840
You have to take out your shoes for about ten minutes

00:58:59.730 --> 00:59:04.690
and put them, your feet, on the Mother Earth.

00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:16.890
On your lap.

00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:19.920
This is suggestive that you are desirous

00:59:20.790 --> 00:59:25.760
of having your Self-realization.

00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:33.910
We'll tell you about the centers on the left-hand side

00:59:34.790 --> 00:59:40.680
which we'll be nourishing ourselves.

00:59:52.880 --> 00:59:56.890
Now please put your right hand on your heart, where resides

00:59:57.750 --> 01:00:00.840
the spirit.

01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:10.740
On the heart. Left side, left side.

01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:17.790
If the spirit shines in you, then it guides you;

01:00:17.870 --> 01:00:22.910
that's how you become your own master.

01:00:28.880 --> 01:00:33.840
So now please take down your hand in the upper portion of

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:40.790
your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:00:42.810 --> 01:00:46.890
This is the center of your mastery.

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:59.760
Now, here is the center made by all the prophets,

01:01:00.770 --> 01:01:06.880
which when enlightened, makes you the master of

01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:12.690
handling divine Power.

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:20.920
Please sit down. Don't disturb us, at least.

01:01:21.730 --> 01:01:26.730
If you are Christians, sit down. Please don't disturb us.

01:01:27.790 --> 01:01:34.690
Sit down. Be humble, listen. Please be seated.

01:01:34.790 --> 01:01:37.870
At least behave like Christians.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:49.860
Now, you have to take your right hand in the lower portion

01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:54.810
of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:03.710
This is the center of pure knowledge,

01:02:05.730 --> 01:02:10.790
not bookish knowledge but pure knowledge which works,

01:02:12.820 --> 01:02:17.710
which works the divine Power;

01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:24.770
by which you give realizations to others, cure others,

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.800
everything.

01:02:31.910 --> 01:02:34.840
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your

01:02:34.840 --> 01:02:38.920
abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:49.900
Now, again on your heart.

01:02:53.740 --> 01:02:56.820
On your heart.

01:03:06.780 --> 01:03:12.720
Now in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.920
and turn your head to your right.

01:03:19.810 --> 01:03:22.700
I have already told you that this center goes out of order

01:03:22.810 --> 01:03:28.820
when you feel guilty. Don't feel guilty at all.

01:03:35.850 --> 01:03:40.920
Now, take your right hand and put it

01:03:41.800 --> 01:03:46.800
on your forehead across.

01:03:49.700 --> 01:03:53.690
Put down your head.

01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:02.820
Here you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:08.900
Now, please take your hand back

01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:12.910
on the back side of your head,

01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:19.910
and push back your head.

01:04:20.910 --> 01:04:26.830
Here you have to say without feeling guilty,

01:04:26.910 --> 01:04:31.700
without counting your mistakes, for your satisfaction,

01:04:32.690 --> 01:04:34.780
"Oh, divine Power, if I have done anything,

01:04:34.860 --> 01:04:38.680
please forgive me."

01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:53.750
Now, please stretch your palm,

01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:06.810
and put the center of your palm on top

01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:12.890
of the fontanel bone area,

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:20.710
and press it down, your head.

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:25.850
Push back your fingers so there's a good pressure.

01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:35.830
And now move your scalp slowly,

01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:45.840
seven times clockwise.

01:06:11.830 --> 01:06:16.720
Now, take down your hand.

01:06:17.910 --> 01:06:21.860
That's all we have to do.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:24.690
You can take out your spectacles

01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:27.840
because you have to close your eyes,

01:06:31.790 --> 01:06:37.810
and also if there's anything tight here or on your waist,

01:06:38.680 --> 01:06:41.710
please take it out.

01:06:58.690 --> 01:07:01.780
Now again put your left hand towards Me,

01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.880
both the feet away from each other,

01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:13.730
and close your eyes and put your right hand on your heart.

01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:30.680
Here you ask Me a very fundamental question

01:07:30.830 --> 01:07:38.750
you can call Me  "Mother" or "Shri Mataji" - three times,

01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:54.810
"Mother, am I the spirit?" Ask this question three times.

01:07:54.890 --> 01:07:55.850
Loudly.

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:23.700
If you are the spirit, you are your master.

01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:26.680
So please take your right hand in the upper portion

01:08:26.740 --> 01:08:29.880
of your abdomen, and ask Me another question -

01:08:30.770 --> 01:08:32.830
on the left-hand side -

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:37.850
"Mother, am I my own master?"

01:08:58.900 --> 01:09:02.880
I've already told you that I respect your freedom,

01:09:03.690 --> 01:09:08.910
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

01:09:19.730 --> 01:09:25.730
So please take down your right hand in the lower portion of

01:09:25.830 --> 01:09:29.790
your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:09:33.850 --> 01:09:38.910
You have to ask for pure knowledge.

01:09:39.870 --> 01:09:41.880
So please say six times,

01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:45.910
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:49.720
Loudly.

01:10:01.770 --> 01:10:11.870
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:19.820
the Kundalini, the reflection of the Holy Ghost, starts rising.

01:10:28.690 --> 01:10:31.890
Now please take your right hand

01:10:35.780 --> 01:10:37.780
onto the upper portion of your abdomen

01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:40.860
on the left-hand side.

01:10:46.850 --> 01:10:53.720
We have to nourish these centers with our full confidence.

01:10:58.870 --> 01:11:04.780
Here you have to say with full confidence,

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:12.900
"Mother, I am my own master."

01:11:39.890 --> 01:11:44.740
I've already told you that the fundamental truth about you

01:11:44.840 --> 01:11:49.870
is that you are the pure spirit.

01:11:53.790 --> 01:11:57.720
You are not this body, you are not this mind,

01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:02.890
you are not this ego or these conditionings,

01:12:03.750 --> 01:12:08.690
but you are pure spirit.

01:12:16.890 --> 01:12:23.850
So now raise your right hand on your heart,

01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:30.790
and with full confidence say, twelve times,

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.830
"Mother, I am the pure spirit."

01:12:43.810 --> 01:12:46.700
The divine Power

01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:54.890
is the power of compassion and love,

01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:11.840
it is the ocean of pure knowledge,

01:13:17.690 --> 01:13:25.750
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:13:32.830 --> 01:13:37.730
So whatever mistakes you might commit,

01:13:38.730 --> 01:13:46.910
the ocean of forgiveness can dissolve it with its power.

01:13:54.720 --> 01:13:59.710
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and

01:13:59.880 --> 01:14:07.720
your shoulder, and put your head to your right.

01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.800
Here

01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:19.710
you have to say with full confidence, sixteen times,

01:14:19.840 --> 01:14:26.810
"Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:39.800
I have already told you,

01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:44.810
logically whether you forgive or don't forgive,

01:14:44.920 --> 01:14:49.720
you do not do anything.

01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.840
But if you do not forgive, then you play into wrong hands

01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:05.770
and torture yourself.

01:15:12.760 --> 01:15:19.820
So now raise your right hand to your forehead,

01:15:21.890 --> 01:15:25.880
and put down your head.

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:29.860
Here from your heart, not how many times, say,

01:15:30.750 --> 01:15:36.790
"Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:05.890
Now, take back your right hand on the back side

01:16:06.730 --> 01:16:13.790
of your head, and push back your head.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.740
Here you have to say, without feeling guilty,

01:16:18.800 --> 01:16:22.880
without counting your mistakes, for your own satisfaction,

01:16:23.740 --> 01:16:26.820
"Oh, divine Power, if I have done any mistakes,

01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:31.830
please forgive me."

01:16:43.790 --> 01:16:48.810
Say it from your heart, not how many times.

01:17:00.760 --> 01:17:02.700
Now,

01:17:05.850 --> 01:17:09.790
stretch your palm,

01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:16.740
and please put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone

01:17:16.820 --> 01:17:21.850
area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:32.790
Now bend your head.

01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:39.860
Push back your fingers to put a pressure on your scalp.

01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:48.890
Now move your scalp slowly, seven times.

01:17:49.810 --> 01:17:53.910
But here again I cannot force Self-realization on you.

01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.790
I respect your freedom. So say seven times,

01:17:57.900 --> 01:18:04.750
"Mother, please give me Self-realization."

01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:12.730
Now, please take down your hands.

01:19:16.890 --> 01:19:22.760
Please put your hands like this towards Me,

01:19:30.710 --> 01:19:35.710
and watch Me without thinking.

01:19:35.910 --> 01:19:38.910
Like this, like this.

01:19:39.790 --> 01:19:42.920
Now bend your head,

01:19:43.810 --> 01:19:46.740
and with the left hand see if there's

01:19:46.850 --> 01:19:49.720
a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your own head -

01:19:49.820 --> 01:19:53.820
you have to certify yourself.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.920
Don't put the hand on top of your head but away from it,

01:20:11.810 --> 01:20:18.760
and see for yourself. This is the proof.

01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:27.680
Now, please put the left hand towards Me,

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:36.720
and put down your head again and see with the right hand.

01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:41.700
Some people get it far away also.

01:20:46.840 --> 01:20:51.730
Now with the right hand again.

01:20:58.790 --> 01:21:06.860
Now, please put both your hands towards the sky like this,

01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:11.740
and ask a question,

01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:16.880
one of those - one of these questions you ask,

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:24.750
"Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:21:26.890 --> 01:21:34.820
Or second one, "Mother, is this the divine love of God?"

01:21:37.900 --> 01:21:44.710
Or "Mother, is it Ruh or Paramchaitanya?"

01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:56.810
Any one of these, you ask question three times.

01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:06.730
Now please put down your hands. They've got it!

01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:10.760
Put down your hands, please.

01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.900
Like this you put it now.

01:22:17.840 --> 01:22:21.860
Those who have felt cool or hot breeze

01:22:22.720 --> 01:22:25.730
out of their fontanel bone,

01:22:25.890 --> 01:22:29.820
or on their hands or fingertips,

01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:33.770
please raise both your hands.

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:51.740
This is the proof. May God bless you.

01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:56.920
Now you have become really Christians.

01:22:58.730 --> 01:23:02.780
Now you have become saints.

01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:05.750
This has to grow,

01:23:06.830 --> 01:23:10.720
your divinity has to grow.

01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:16.900
As I told you, it will grow in collectivity.

01:23:19.810 --> 01:23:24.740
We have here a very good center, and there are many people

01:23:24.850 --> 01:23:29.730
who know about Sahaja Yoga very well.

01:23:34.880 --> 01:23:37.830
You all should come,

01:23:39.680 --> 01:23:43.710
and become great Sahaja yogis.

01:23:46.770 --> 01:23:50.720
You have to save your fellow-men here;

01:24:00.700 --> 01:24:05.680
and you'll become masters in no time.

01:24:08.700 --> 01:24:11.730
You don't have to pay for anything.

01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:18.850
May God bless you.

01:24:20.830 --> 01:24:27.780
I would like to meet you people today, tonight, if possible.

01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:39.870
Now, they should come up...

01:25:35.690 --> 01:25:40.780
Don't talk with them. They are negative people.

01:27:13.900 --> 01:27:15.830
[Shri Mataji works on the seekers.]
