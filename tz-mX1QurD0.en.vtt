00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400
So I forgot to mention one cute little moment with Sri Mataji that took place in New York

2
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.800
during the 1981 tour.

3
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.160
And it was after the public program.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.760
I'm not sure if it was, I think it was the second public program, it might have been

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.760
the first.

6
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.400
And we went to dinner at a diner.

7
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.840
And there were eight of us including Sri Mataji.

8
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:36.440
And there were two tables separated by an aisle and two yogis on each side of each table.

9
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.000
And I was on the one table on the inside.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.800
And Sri Mataji was at the other table just to my right on the outside.

11
00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.040
And I had been a very staunch vegetarian.

12
00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.960
And back in those days, when I talked about being so badly damaged, I was damaged in countless

13
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.960
ways.

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.720
So the vegetarian, you know, it starts out where you, you know, give up one thing, and

15
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.760
then you give up more and you give up more.

16
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.480
And so I was fasting a lot.

17
00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:16.240
And just it's this like self deprivation or whatever the word is.

18
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:24.520
So the yogis back then in London had been really trying to get me to eat anything, including

19
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:25.520
meat.

20
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.880
And I was staunch, like it became a real ego trip.

21
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.520
I didn't realize at the time, but you know, I felt like, okay, we don't have to kill on

22
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.360
animals.

23
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.680
And that I'm a better person for that.

24
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.180
And I'm better than other people who do, who do eat meat.

25
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.520
So it had become kind of an arrogant, it had become an arrogance.

26
00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:02.200
And the yogis had been working so tirelessly on me to try to get me to just eat and to

27
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200
eat meat.

28
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.440
And we went to this diner, and I'm looking at the menu.

29
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.480
And all of a sudden, I had this incredible desire to eat chicken.

30
00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.960
And I hadn't in at least eight or nine years.

31
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.400
And there was a battle going on as I'm looking at this menu, and it's a diner, I'm trying

32
00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.840
to find anything vegetarian on this menu.

33
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.660
And there was very little, you know, if you don't eat eggs, and you'd, you know, so I'm

34
00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.780
staring at this menu.

35
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.160
And this desire is non not going away.

36
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.560
And I have this battle going on inside.

37
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.860
And all of a sudden, I look up, and I look over at Shri Mataji.

38
00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:54.040
And she gave me this massive smile, as if to say, I'm doing that.

39
00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.580
And I understood.

40
00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.080
I surrendered and I ordered the chicken sandwich the next day.

41
00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.300
So it must have been the night of the first public program, because the next day, she

42
00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.940
was speaking about Navi chakra.

43
00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.420
Swadhisthana and Navi, I think she might have done both in one day.

44
00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:23.460
And she said in the talk, if you want to please Shri Lakshmi, she's very fond of chicken.

45
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:28.900
And she looked right at me.

46
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.740
And obviously from all of the problems that were there.

47
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:44.300
When I came to sajaga, I this Navi finger was numb, completely numb.

48
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.780
And she said, my left Navi had been frozen.

49
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.980
I didn't talk about a lot of those personal types of things.

50
00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:58.700
But you know, my mother had it started with breast cancer, went to lymphatic, and then

51
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.860
it went to blood and then to bone cancer.

52
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:12.100
And so, I mean, I feel every day is a gift.

53
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.460
I was in on that first tour.

54
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:22.880
I heard Abdu'l-Dut's program how, you know, that one day, mother had him put his hand

55
00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.260
on her liver and he got so sick.

56
00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.580
Well, I was like that the whole first week of the tour.

57
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.380
I was really sick.

58
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:41.060
And I probably spent 20 years working on that left Navi.

59
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.840
Yeah, probably a good 20 years.

60
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.920
And slowly, slowly, slowly, it didn't go away overnight.

61
00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:58.660
But there have been, you know, he told a few stories, which I was so tempted, where there

62
00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.700
were these incredible miracles that happened.

63
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.340
Actually, there was one with mother, but it didn't involve communicating with her.

64
00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:13.060
It was during a puja in Los Angeles in 1980.

65
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.860
I think probably it was 83.

66
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.540
Yes, my dear.

67
00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:20.460
I think I have to go.

68
00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.460
I'm not going to tell.

69
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:23.460
No worries.

70
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.360
But please, please just make a little note of these things as they occur to you.

71
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:31.960
And please do come back again, because it's been an absolutely wonderful evening.

72
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.960
Thank you.

73
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.960
Thank you, Caroline.

74
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.080
Thank you for your patience.
