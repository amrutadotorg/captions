00:47.430 --> 00:54.430
Dr. Warren has already talked to you

01:37.680 --> 01:44.680
about the different centers that we have within
ourselves, and you can see how beautifully

01:45.860 --> 01:52.860
they are placed and how gradually when the
Kundalini rises, how She enlightens the innermost

01:56.390 --> 02:03.390
core of the centers. There are three channels
in the central channel, and the innermost

02:12.060 --> 02:19.060
channel is used by Kundalini to pierce through
for the first time. You can imagine Kundalini

02:24.720 --> 02:31.720
to be made of many strands of energy tied
together just like a rope, and as the chakras

02:39.730 --> 02:46.730
start opening more strands start getting awakened
and they pierce through these six centers;

02:54.910 --> 03:01.910
but if a person after Realization just thinks
that he has got the Realization, then he doesn't

03:03.989 --> 03:10.989
have to bother about it, may lose it for the
time being, for quite some time I should say,

03:12.019 --> 03:19.019
and he'll have to work much harder to re-establish
his Self Realization.

03:20.799 --> 03:27.799
I've seen many-a-times when we give Realization
to people they say, “Yes, we have felt it.”

03:29.169 --> 03:36.169
They did feel it, everything happens, and
then they loose it because they have not established

03:39.130 --> 03:46.130
their Realization properly, for which luckily
in every place wherever I go I see to it that

03:47.600 --> 03:54.600
we already have a center established, then
you can go to that center and you can learn

03:57.859 --> 04:04.859
from them how to establish your Realization.
That is a very, very important time which

04:06.989 --> 04:09.040
must be taken into consideration.

04:09.040 --> 04:16.040
There was a lady who had cancer, she was cured
of her cancer, she was perfectly all right

04:18.389 --> 04:25.389
and she went back to her family, she was doing
very well, and after some time - a year or

04:30.169 --> 04:37.169
so - she came back with another disease of
a very serious nature.

04:37.500 --> 04:43.300
So I asked her, “How is it that you are
cured of cancer, now you get another disease?

04:43.300 --> 04:45.790
Did you do anything about it?”

04:45.790 --> 04:51.479
“No, Mother, I went back from here, everybody
says, ‘You are looking very fine.’ They

04:51.479 --> 04:57.720
are all right, they were all quite surprised
how I was cured, and I never bothered to do

04:57.720 --> 04:59.840
anything about it.”

04:59.840 --> 05:06.840
So she got another trouble. You go on like
this, you cure one thing then you again cure

05:09.229 --> 05:16.229
another thing. Like little children, you clean
them, then again they get out and soil their

05:16.300 --> 05:22.310
clothes, again they are back in the bathroom,
then again you clean them, again they do the

05:22.310 --> 05:29.310
same thing. So you have to mature, after Realization
you must in all wisdom and sensible behavior,

05:30.650 --> 05:37.280
you must mature of it, otherwise it is a big
headache to Me and big headache to you, and

05:37.280 --> 05:44.280
you can be quite lost also with it, because
if a seed is half-sprouted it is of no use

05:46.180 --> 05:47.610
at all.

05:47.610 --> 05:54.610
So if you want that you should really have
the complete bliss of Self Realization, you

05:55.409 --> 06:02.020
have to become a little serious person about
it. Shallow temperament is not going to help

06:02.020 --> 06:07.250
you, or looking at it as if like another guru
shopping business it is not going to work

06:07.250 --> 06:13.960
out. You have to work to see that you establish
yourself, till you have established you are

06:13.960 --> 06:19.729
not to work on other people but once you are
established you can start working on other

06:19.729 --> 06:26.729
people, giving them Realization. There is
no need then for you to bother that you will

06:26.800 --> 06:33.800
catch from others, or anything; but before
that you should not try to help others. First

06:34.069 --> 06:40.449
help yourself, selfishness to begin with.
Unless and until you are all right and you

06:40.449 --> 06:47.449
know all the methods of protecting yourself,
you are not to indulge into Sahaja Yoga practices

06:48.469 --> 06:55.469
which helps others. But when you become an
expert, when you have an expertise then you

06:56.569 --> 07:02.629
should do it. Like a mechanic who doesn’t
know how to repair a car, they spoil it more.

07:02.629 --> 07:07.490
So better become an expert for which you don't
have to pay anything, you don't have to do

07:07.490 --> 07:13.759
much about it but only to understand how you
have to move the Kundalini within you, how

07:13.759 --> 07:20.759
you have to establish it back, what problems
you have and how you have to cure. You will

07:23.030 --> 07:27.520
be surprised you won't be aware of problems
that you have.

07:27.520 --> 07:32.639
One gentleman came and told Me, “Mother
everyone is coming and asking me, ‘what

07:32.639 --> 07:35.069
about your father, what's the problem?’”

07:35.069 --> 07:37.629
I said, “Everybody said the same?”

07:37.629 --> 07:38.949
He said, “Yes.”

07:38.949 --> 07:41.439
I said, “I also want to know, what about
your father?”

07:41.439 --> 07:47.759
He said, “My father died very early in life,
and I always had a feeling that I had no father.”

07:47.759 --> 07:54.759
That can be cured, and he developed asthma
with it, so everybody knows, those who know

07:54.770 --> 08:01.520
one thing that is the truth about you. All
of them will say the same thing, even if it

08:01.520 --> 08:06.819
is a small child, he will also come and ask
you that “Is your father all right?” Because

08:06.819 --> 08:12.439
if he knows that this center, this center
on the right hand side means the father. So

08:12.439 --> 08:19.389
he will also say the same and then he will
come and ask you, “what about your father?”

08:19.389 --> 08:26.389
It is so remarkable sometimes the way people
see these things that they can't believe it,

08:27.180 --> 08:31.569
but this is nothing, what you get is just
a wee bit of it.

08:31.569 --> 08:38.569
But as Kundalini rises, on every center you
start getting the light of that center. At

08:40.180 --> 08:47.180
the first center you get back your innocence,
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes

08:50.350 --> 08:56.890
innocent, you are not filled with lust and
greed, you don't look at things with lust

08:56.890 --> 09:03.850
and greed, but you look at things with innocence,
which is a very big thing that people have

09:03.850 --> 09:10.850
lost and that you get back and such a person
develops many qualities. One of them is that

09:11.350 --> 09:18.350
such a person is full of fragrance, such a
person has a tremendous gravity, tremendous

09:21.940 --> 09:28.940
gravity, and such a person has tremendous
dynamism, and attraction is a bad word so

09:30.560 --> 09:34.370
I don't want to use it, but magnetical.

09:34.370 --> 09:41.370
His magnets is awakened within him, this is
the center of your magnet of the earth. Such

09:43.380 --> 09:50.380
a person develops a tremendous sense of roots
and sense of direction, you place him anywhere

09:52.149 --> 09:58.079
he will know where to go. Like birds, you
place birds anywhere they know which side

09:58.079 --> 10:05.079
is north, south, east, west. In the same way
you also develop your lost innocence and your

10:07.110 --> 10:13.320
magnet within you by which you have proper
direction; but the highest of all you develop

10:13.320 --> 10:20.320
the proper direction to wisdom which is the
wise thing to do. You just don't do stupid

10:21.190 --> 10:28.190
things, you just don't do, even if you ever
try to do it, you will not do it, because

10:28.209 --> 10:35.209
you know it is so stupid, just you don't do
it. I mean it is so simple to be wise than

10:37.380 --> 10:43.779
to be stupid, because if you have to be stupid
you have to go out of the way to be stupid

10:43.779 --> 10:50.779
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal
and wise is the easiest thing to do. But what

10:51.180 --> 10:58.180
people do is to do things that would make
them more and more stupid, nonsensical, because

11:00.779 --> 11:07.779
also some people told Me they do it, the reason
being they think they have a nuisance value.

11:09.680 --> 11:15.170
Like in London now we have one funny stuff
going on, they call it what? “Punk rock.”

11:15.170 --> 11:20.630
You see, it's a funny stuff. Now poor kids
they don't know what they are doing it, and

11:20.630 --> 11:27.630
I think the only value of that punk rock system
is this: that they try to sort of make a nuisance

11:33.240 --> 11:38.500
out of them so that people feel attracted
towards them or sort of a significance out

11:38.500 --> 11:45.329
of them. But when you become a realized soul
you realize your significance, because you

11:45.329 --> 11:52.329
understand you are part and parcel of the
whole and that your significance is to give

11:52.519 --> 11:59.519
Realization to others, the highest of highest,
that's what you have to do now you are a saint,

11:59.790 --> 12:06.790
and that’s how the whole attitude of cheapiness,
of outward shallowness finishes and you become

12:09.050 --> 12:16.050
a serene, dignified personality. This is not
possible through any sermon, any lecture,

12:16.209 --> 12:23.209
it's only possible when the Kundalini rises
you become like a very dignified child, very

12:24.769 --> 12:27.000
dignified child.

12:27.000 --> 12:34.000
I've seen one beautiful painting done of Mother
Mary being taught first time. You see Her

12:37.399 --> 12:43.269
as a child, She is a very dignified personality,
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

12:43.269 --> 12:50.269
I've seen My own grandchildren who are not
very old but extremely dignified. They walk

12:50.399 --> 12:56.769
like kings, behave like kings. In every behavior
you find there's such a dignity, they'll never

12:56.769 --> 13:02.029
do something shallow, they never ask for anything,
they never weep for anything, they never cry

13:02.029 --> 13:08.079
for anything, they are so dignified and they
understand it so well what is dignity is.

13:08.079 --> 13:14.230
I don't have to tell them, because they are
born realized, in the same way you become,

13:14.230 --> 13:18.680
nobody has to tell you that “do this, or
do that,” but you understand that you must

13:18.680 --> 13:25.680
have self-respect. This happens to you automatically,
this is actualization, nobody has to tell

13:26.230 --> 13:30.870
you that “you be dignified,” you just
become. I've seen people who were absolutely

13:30.870 --> 13:36.759
absurd, even from this punk rock we got some
people and they were so changed that people

13:36.759 --> 13:41.880
could not recognize them, but one thing bad
has happened with this punk rock that they

13:41.880 --> 13:48.000
put some sort of dye in their head and since
then their eyes became very weak, because

13:48.000 --> 13:55.000
these dyes I think made the optic globe covered
with some sort of a color and you can't see

13:56.079 --> 14:01.720
properly, and the eyes became very weak and
it took some time for us to remove the effect

14:01.720 --> 14:04.220
of those dyes from their head.

14:04.220 --> 14:09.360
We go headlong, “what's wrong?” There
is nothing wrong in this world if it is a

14:09.360 --> 14:15.670
stupid fool, but for a wise man there are
very many things which are absolutely wrong,

14:15.670 --> 14:22.670
and there are very many things which are absolutely
correct, so you develop your wisdom by this

14:22.800 --> 14:24.170
first center.

14:24.170 --> 14:31.170
Now as the Kundalini rises She enlightens
your second center which we can call as the

14:31.730 --> 14:36.490
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though
it is the third center. But second center,

14:36.490 --> 14:43.490
you become extremely creative, extremely creative.
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had

14:44.420 --> 14:46.009
no job.

14:46.009 --> 14:48.649
And he said, “Mother, I have no job and
what should I do?”

14:48.649 --> 14:51.230
I said, “All right, what do you want to
do?”

14:51.230 --> 14:52.850
He said, “Whatever you say.”

14:52.850 --> 14:56.560
I said, “All right, why don't you become
an interior decorator?”

14:56.560 --> 15:01.750
He said, “Me? I don't know what is a teak
wood, I don’t know what is a rose wood,

15:01.750 --> 15:03.670
how am I to become an interior decorator?”

15:03.670 --> 15:06.360
I said, “You just use your vibrations.”

15:06.360 --> 15:11.480
And you'll be surprised he earned million
of rupees out of that profession because you

15:11.480 --> 15:18.480
become extremely creative, your sense of creation
becomes so subtle and so beautiful that you

15:20.009 --> 15:26.160
start understanding art at such a high level
that people don't know how, when you are not

15:26.160 --> 15:33.110
educated in art, how you can do it. I went
to Japan once, and they were having an Ikebana

15:33.110 --> 15:37.959
competition or something, so I went to see
the Ikebana class and they requested Me, “Why

15:37.959 --> 15:39.569
don't you do some flower arrangements?”

15:39.569 --> 15:41.690
I said, “All right, I'll do.”

15:41.690 --> 15:48.069
I did it and I got the highest marks without
knowing a word about Ikebana, just surprise

15:48.069 --> 15:54.180
Me, I got the highest mark. I can do lots
of things which I've never done before like

15:54.180 --> 15:59.410
architecture. I have built houses without
doing any architecture, I've done decorations

15:59.410 --> 16:06.410
of the houses, I've done all kinds of things
without knowing how to it, because you become

16:06.720 --> 16:08.120
you so creative.

16:08.120 --> 16:13.310
Music you start understanding so much better.
There are people now in America, there's a

16:13.310 --> 16:19.310
girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice, absolutely
hoarse voice, and she always used to go out

16:19.310 --> 16:20.560
of tune.

16:20.560 --> 16:24.160
So I told her, “You shouldn’t sing songs
before Me because it’s rather funny.”

16:24.160 --> 16:27.279
She said, “Mother, why don't You give me
a good voice?”

16:27.279 --> 16:32.279
I said, “You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll

16:32.279 --> 16:34.389
be all right.”

16:34.389 --> 16:40.740
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don’t you
sit down.]

16:40.740 --> 16:47.170
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was … she tried
on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations, and

16:47.170 --> 16:54.170
she sings so melodiously now that I tell you
she can be a great singer. So the creativity,

16:54.170 --> 17:01.170
that also is a blessing of your power of the
Goddess of learning. Boys who could not study

17:03.069 --> 17:08.730
in the schools were absolutely duffers. Some
people brought this boy, recently I’ve received

17:08.730 --> 17:09.780
a letter from him.

17:09.780 --> 17:13.560
When he came to Me, his father said that “He
is going to be taken out of school because

17:13.560 --> 17:17.550
he's good for nothing, he can not remember
anything, he's absolutely finished.”

17:17.550 --> 17:22.140
I said, “All right, doesn't matter, let
him take to Sahaja Yoga.”

17:22.140 --> 17:28.360
He got his Realization. Not only that he passed
with first class, but he got a scholarship.

17:28.360 --> 17:35.360
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young

17:35.950 --> 17:41.390
age. He wrote to Me, “Mother no one can
believe that a duffer like me has been so

17:41.390 --> 17:47.560
much highly placed.” All the boys who got
scholarships in Maharashtra in schools, in

17:47.560 --> 17:51.850
colleges and universities are Sahaja Yogis.

17:51.850 --> 17:58.440
It is such a tremendous force that starts
working in you, if you try to give vibrations

17:58.440 --> 18:05.440
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat
and such things which are very important for

18:10.940 --> 18:17.940
life, any food, you will be amazed that the
food also grows so much more and the taste

18:19.690 --> 18:26.460
is so good and it lasts you so longer. Like
one gentleman tried, a university professor

18:26.460 --> 18:33.460
in agricultural college on some wheat, some
vibrations and he was amazed that when they

18:34.140 --> 18:40.350
collected this wheat it was at least six times
more than normal, and when this wheat was

18:40.350 --> 18:47.350
stored in a big hall like this, there were
so many other things, the rats who are always

18:50.720 --> 18:55.770
a menace in India never touched that wheat.
They ate all the rest of it but never touched

18:55.770 --> 18:57.100
the wheat.

18:57.100 --> 19:04.100
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers,
of course the dogs and the cats - understand

19:05.550 --> 19:11.580
it much more, they understand you, they know
that you are a saint. They'll never touch

19:11.580 --> 19:16.300
you, they will never trouble you. Even a tiger
sees a saint, he never attacks. You can handle

19:16.300 --> 19:21.770
a tiger very easily; this is the power of
a saint. So you develop a tremendous capacity

19:21.770 --> 19:28.770
of creativity. The greatest capacity you have
then is of creating a new human being out

19:31.990 --> 19:38.810
of a ordinary human being. This is the greatest
blessing that you have, that you transform

19:38.810 --> 19:45.810
an egg into a bird and that is the epitome,
that is the spiritual power you have, by which

19:46.060 --> 19:53.060
you can transform the whole human race into
a new race which has this fifth dimension

19:54.620 --> 19:57.320
within yourself.

19:57.320 --> 20:02.630
You can start talking on science now, we have
a scientist here and he's a done his science,

20:02.630 --> 20:08.170
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that,
in chemistry and I explained to him about

20:08.170 --> 20:12.690
this - where is the hydrogen and oxygen and
nitrogen and all that within us and he was

20:12.690 --> 20:12.990
amazed.

20:12.990 --> 20:15.980
He said, “Mother, how do you know all these
things?”

20:15.980 --> 20:20.970
I said, “I don't know how I know, but I
know. That’s what it is, you just have a

20:20.970 --> 20:22.030
look at this.”

20:22.030 --> 20:27.970
And he was amazed how I was telling him about
spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

20:27.970 --> 20:30.110
He said that “For this I had to study so
much.”

20:30.110 --> 20:34.070
I said, “For Sahaja Yog you don't have to
study.” A little bit you know and immediately

20:34.070 --> 20:39.310
you click the point. Now this is the second
thing that you know in your learnings, in

20:39.310 --> 20:44.670
your education you are all right, but the
mastery of this center comes, the mastery

20:44.670 --> 20:51.670
of this center comes when you know the pure
knowledge, the pure knowledge of handling

20:51.750 --> 20:58.750
the Kundalini, the pure knowledge of Spirit,
the pure knowledge of the blessings of God,

20:59.100 --> 21:05.900
of Ritambhara Pragya. If you know that, that
is the highest that you achieve gradually

21:05.900 --> 21:12.900
as you grow, because when these centers starts
expanding on the sides, you start expanding

21:13.140 --> 21:20.140
in your personality, in your sensitivity and
in your evolutionary ascent, so that is how

21:20.580 --> 21:25.710
you start growing from one to another to another
to another.

21:25.710 --> 21:31.460
Now the third center that we have actually,
this is the second center because the third

21:31.460 --> 21:38.460
center arises, this Swadishthana arises out
of the Nabhi, is a very, very important center,

21:39.020 --> 21:45.980
is the center of your seeking as he has told
you. Your compete priorities change, complete

21:45.980 --> 21:52.530
priorities change, because the joy that you
get out of Sahaja Yoga, the joy you get out

21:52.530 --> 21:59.530
of this meditation, out of the feeling that
grows in you all the time, like a beautiful

22:02.330 --> 22:09.330
torrential rain of joy that fills you, your
life and everybody's life, you don't care

22:11.120 --> 22:18.120
for cheap type of entertainment. You feel,
you seek other Sahaja Yogi, you want to meet

22:20.410 --> 22:24.130
another Sahaja Yogi, you don't want to meet
anybody else. If there is an actor coming,

22:24.130 --> 22:28.410
or some big man is coming, “All right, let
him come, I'm going to see such and such person.”

22:28.410 --> 22:35.410
It is such a different personality that one
day - I will tell you how it happens - there

22:36.140 --> 22:41.280
was a girl, a diplomat, she's a diplomat who
is a realized soul and she happened to go

22:41.280 --> 22:46.590
to Sicily. And she was eating her food, suddenly
she felt there is some vibrations coming down,

22:46.590 --> 22:53.020
she looked around, the other one was also
looking at her, she said, “Are you Mataji's

22:53.020 --> 22:53.560
disciple?”

22:53.560 --> 22:56.940
And she said, “Yes, I am Mataji's child.”

22:56.940 --> 23:03.360
They both got up and just hugged and said,
“Such joy Mother in that far-fetched place

23:03.360 --> 23:05.790
of Sicily to find a Sahaja Yogi.”

23:05.790 --> 23:10.800
And then they stayed together and they wouldn’t
go anywhere else but they said, “Now this

23:10.800 --> 23:15.350
is the enjoyment.” Just the company of a
Sahaja Yogi is such an enjoyment.

23:15.350 --> 23:21.100
I've seen these people when they go to India,
the people are not so rich, poor people - they

23:21.100 --> 23:25.090
have little, little huts - but when they go
they go there, you should see the love, the

23:25.090 --> 23:32.090
rapport, and that makes Me so happy, so happy,
the way they love each other, the way they

23:32.370 --> 23:38.780
understand each other, the way they help each
other and the only the company, for the first

23:38.780 --> 23:45.780
time they start enjoying. We were once in
a hotel staying in Calcutta and with two Sahaja

23:46.350 --> 23:50.080
Yogi with Me. They were in the other room,
quite far away, they could not get a room

23:50.080 --> 23:56.030
close to Me, and one gentleman came for his
Realization, he came to My feet, when he got

23:56.030 --> 24:00.750
his Realization it was a tremendous happening
and they came rushing from there.

24:00.750 --> 24:02.110
I said, “What happened?”

24:02.110 --> 24:07.110
They said, “We felt the vibrations, we felt
the vibrations from there, Mother, so we have

24:07.110 --> 24:09.490
come to receive the vibrations.”

24:09.490 --> 24:16.490
And they came and they felt the vibrations.
So this man was so great that his vibrations

24:16.770 --> 24:22.750
attracted them and they came down. They were
just enjoying that as if they were enjoying

24:22.750 --> 24:26.750
a big flower with lots of fragrance. What
vibrations, what vibrations! The fellow got

24:26.750 --> 24:33.750
up and said, “Very nice. They are enjoying
my vibrations. Now I'm going to enjoy your

24:33.980 --> 24:34.480
vibrations.”

24:34.480 --> 24:41.480
For the first time you start enjoying your
fellow man because everyone is a beautiful

24:43.090 --> 24:50.090
personality, a glorious, fragrant, joyful
personality; but because you cannot feel the

24:51.380 --> 24:56.650
other person, and because the other person
does not emit, you are all the time quarreling.

24:56.650 --> 25:00.950
Even husband-wife quarreling, father-mother
quarreling, this one quarreling, that quarreling.

25:00.950 --> 25:06.110
In Sahaja Yoga there is hardly any time for
people to quarrel. The other day I had a lady

25:06.110 --> 25:10.940
who came to see Me, and she was trying to
put her point and there were about five-six

25:10.940 --> 25:16.640
Sahaja Yogis, and everybody was putting the
same point and she was amazed.

25:16.640 --> 25:22.700
She said, “I've never seen such concord,
such friendship, such understanding, all of

25:22.700 --> 25:27.980
them supporting each other, nobody is cutting
anyone.”

25:27.980 --> 25:34.600
Such a society has to develop. It’s such
a nourishing, soothing, invigorating society,

25:34.600 --> 25:41.600
and you forget about getting bored, boredom
goes out of life, you never get bored, you

25:41.770 --> 25:47.330
enjoy yourself or you enjoy the company of
Sahaja Yogis and it is very different level

25:47.330 --> 25:53.610
that you come of - that is what, that land
you have to reach within yourself.

25:53.610 --> 26:00.610
Now the greatest thing that happens as a result
of this center seeking, that you start seeking

26:01.020 --> 26:07.830
other seekers, you try to find out “where
is the seeker?” If you hear somebody is

26:07.830 --> 26:13.560
a seeker, you go and see. If you hear about
someone that some people are lost there, they

26:13.560 --> 26:19.730
were seekers, but they went there lost, you
all rush there. It is like a person who is

26:19.730 --> 26:26.730
like a, what you call a guard on the seashore
you know, there are guards kept for salvaging

26:27.450 --> 26:34.450
people, and that is how you become. You suddenly
see somebody sinking, you just go. In Bombay

26:34.990 --> 26:39.320
there was a case they announce that “there’s
a lady who is going to die, if somebody can

26:39.320 --> 26:44.850
come and help her, it will be a great thing.”
They all rushed there; they saved her.

26:44.850 --> 26:51.010
Now the interests changes completely, and
you start really helping people and not feeling

26:51.010 --> 26:58.010
that you are helping them, not at all. But
the surrounding portion of that, which is

26:59.280 --> 27:06.280
the void, is the best, which is affected by
your awakening, that you become the virtue

27:06.660 --> 27:13.660
itself. Nobody has to tell you that you be
virtuous, when you are awakened you become

27:14.910 --> 27:21.910
a virtuous person, you enjoy your virtues,
you enjoy being good, you enjoy being nice,

27:26.230 --> 27:33.230
you really enjoy it. And that enjoyment comes
to you as a blessing because the virtue itself

27:33.560 --> 27:40.560
is so strengthening, so powerful that anyone
who is harmed or troubled or tortured or put

27:44.690 --> 27:51.690
down, you stand up, you are not afraid of
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

27:53.100 --> 28:00.100
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

28:00.550 --> 28:07.320
I'm just a lady and single-handed I told them
who these people are, how they are going to

28:07.320 --> 28:13.180
loot you, and what they are going to do; but
in this country nobody can think of one genuine

28:13.180 --> 28:20.180
person who could be really genuine. It was
the problem that time, but with this awakening

28:20.640 --> 28:26.340
within you of the virtuous nature, you just
know what is virtue and what is not virtue.

28:26.340 --> 28:32.690
I don't have to tell you; I don't say “don't
do this, don't do that.” I never say that,

28:32.690 --> 28:39.690
it just happens, because when the virtue starts
developing, the vibrations improve and you

28:39.820 --> 28:46.820
feel extremely joyous. We have lost our virtues
because there is no joy out of it, no reward.

28:52.110 --> 28:56.790
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer; if
somebody's good, he has to suffer; is somebody's

28:56.790 --> 29:03.790
kind, he thinks he has to suffer; but after
getting Realization you are rewarded for your

29:04.820 --> 29:05.170
virtues.

29:05.170 --> 29:10.900
You are amazed how you are paid for it, it’s
so surprising, like once there was a lady

29:10.900 --> 29:16.020
who came to see Me, she was a refugee, and
I had a big house.

29:16.020 --> 29:18.420
So I said, “All right come and stay with
Me.”

29:18.420 --> 29:22.020
So My husband, My brother they came, they
said, “What's this? You don't know her,

29:22.020 --> 29:25.700
who she is, her husband, whether he is her
husband or not, just given her two rooms.

29:25.700 --> 29:26.470
It's not good!”

29:26.470 --> 29:30.630
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter. I
know for nothing is going to happen, let her

29:30.630 --> 29:31.330
be here.”

29:31.330 --> 29:33.850
So they wouldn't also go against Me. They
said, “All right, if you say so.”

29:33.850 --> 29:40.170
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.
Then she become a very well-known actress

29:40.170 --> 29:44.570
in India, I didn't know she was the same lady,
but somebody told Me that she is the same

29:44.570 --> 29:45.720
lady. I said, “Maybe.”

29:45.720 --> 29:51.130
Then one day you see, they wanted to make
a film for our Sahaja Yoga, so they said,

29:51.130 --> 29:54.580
“We can ask this lady to act, because she
is a good actress.”

29:54.580 --> 29:58.910
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don't
tell her I am here, otherwise she will have

29:58.910 --> 30:01.870
no choice. I will not go and see her. You
just ask her.”

30:01.870 --> 30:05.580
They went and ask her, they said, “Will
you be actress?” and all that.

30:05.580 --> 30:06.950
She said, “I'll try.” This, that she was
saying.

30:06.950 --> 30:12.250
But on the day on when they were going to
open the film I went there, she saw Me, she

30:12.250 --> 30:17.090
was so amazed, she said, “Oh God, You are
the One, You are the One Who is sponsoring

30:17.090 --> 30:19.840
this, Oh, I’ll give my life for Her!”
She just came forward, she said, “Have anything

30:19.840 --> 30:26.720
you like, I have nothing to say, I am so sorry
that you never told me that She's there.”

30:26.720 --> 30:32.340
Thousand times more she rewarded a little
thing I did for her.

30:32.340 --> 30:38.620
No more cheating, no more troubling, you become
a wonderful person and so many people become

30:38.620 --> 30:43.630
your friends in this world. Your have to just
tell you are coming, there will hundred people

30:43.630 --> 30:48.220
at the airport to receive you. There will
be so many friends all over the world for

30:48.220 --> 30:54.110
you, you will be amazed. It's such a tremendous
thing happens, because now you all are awakened

30:54.110 --> 31:00.240
in that Primordial Being and you have become
one with each other. You can feel it, that

31:00.240 --> 31:05.740
oneness, that unison that we are all not only
human beings but we are yogis, we are super

31:05.740 --> 31:11.720
human beings, and we have to look after the
whole world. That feeling of compassion is

31:11.720 --> 31:18.720
so overwhelming that all little, little stupid
things just fall off, there's no place for

31:19.230 --> 31:22.880
that. This actually happens and has happened
with many.

31:22.880 --> 31:27.390
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories, but

31:27.390 --> 31:33.190
there are many, some of them were so hot tempered,
some of them were so quarrelsome, some them

31:33.190 --> 31:37.230
used to fight so much in the beginning that
I thought, “How are they going to be all

31:37.230 --> 31:44.100
right?” But today I find them as great friends
and very great yogis. So this is the center

31:44.100 --> 31:49.610
where your religion is awakened. And what
is a religion? Word comes from “religo,”

31:49.610 --> 31:55.140
in Sanskrit it means dharma, “Dhariyatisa
Dharma,” the sustenance, your sustenance,

31:55.140 --> 32:01.530
your valances is your religion. As every atom,
carbon has four valances, and in the same

32:01.530 --> 32:07.400
way you have ten valances, these are the ten
commandments that were told to you and you

32:07.400 --> 32:14.400
become that, you just become. I don't have
to tell you as commandments but they become

32:15.100 --> 32:21.870
your beautiful ornaments within yourself.
This happens automatically, so spontaneously

32:21.870 --> 32:23.020
you become that.

32:23.020 --> 32:28.920
A bishop came to see Me the other day, he
is a relation of Mine, My brother. He came

32:28.920 --> 32:34.530
to see Me, and he was rather adamant and little
angry when he came to see Me because he thought,

32:34.530 --> 32:37.080
“Why am I trying to do this kind of thing?”

32:37.080 --> 32:41.500
But when he saw the Sahaja Yogis he said,
“I'm amazed, you know, I've been giving

32:41.500 --> 32:47.750
lectures in the church for years together,
but I could not achieve anything. How have

32:47.750 --> 32:53.980
You transformed these people? The drug addicts
have suddenly become such good people that

32:53.980 --> 32:58.840
they have given up drugs, alcoholics have
given up alcohol. How is it without telling

32:58.840 --> 32:59.340
them anything?”

32:59.340 --> 33:05.450
I said, “Everything is within them. As soon
as the light comes you can see everything.

33:05.450 --> 33:08.820
You know that this is on your way, this is
against your progress, this is anti-life,

33:08.820 --> 33:13.570
you just give up. Only thing you have to have
the light within you.”

33:13.570 --> 33:20.280
So he himself was surprised at this and then
he said, “Really, that should be done, is

33:20.280 --> 33:21.340
to transform them.”

33:21.340 --> 33:26.230
But I said, “You do not transform them by
giving them big sermons, you transform them

33:26.230 --> 33:33.230
by giving them the real second birth, real
baptism.” And I must say that Calvinist,

33:33.610 --> 33:39.240
of all the persons, Calvinist in Geneva have
accepted Me and they think that this is the

33:39.240 --> 33:41.170
only way they can transform you.

33:41.170 --> 33:48.170
You will be amazed the Calvinist of all the
persons who are such I should say one-sided

33:48.280 --> 33:55.280
people, they have accepted to see the result
of everybody who is open-minded person, who

33:56.000 --> 34:01.400
thinks for the good of others and not for
money-making and for selfish ends. We'll see

34:01.400 --> 34:07.100
one day that this is the way it has to be.
God has given us this power, we have got a

34:07.100 --> 34:12.190
Spirit within us, we should try to awaken
that and we should accept it, not because

34:12.190 --> 34:18.869
I'm doing it, you can do it also. So this
thing happens to you with this chakra.

34:18.869 --> 34:23.849
Now with the another chakra on top, that is
one - as he has told the diseases, I'm telling

34:23.849 --> 34:30.020
you the positive side of it - when this chakra
is caught up he must have told you, you develop

34:30.020 --> 34:37.020
breast cancer and all that. But when it is
awakened, you get all the security of the

34:37.730 --> 34:44.730
world, you are never insecure, you are never
bothered, you have no fear of anyone. You

34:46.659 --> 34:50.589
do not have to suggest yourself that “you
should not have fear or anything,” you just

34:50.589 --> 34:57.589
become fearless, there is no nothing like
fear, there's no reaction to any threat or

34:58.390 --> 35:03.289
anything. Like the gentleman who came here,
just to beat Me now, I was just looking at

35:03.289 --> 35:08.130
the drum, and the fellow was getting frightened
of Me, he was going backwards, backwards,

35:08.130 --> 35:14.440
he would not come forward. But you don't develop
any fear of at all about anyone, because you

35:14.440 --> 35:21.150
are standing on truth, like Christ. At the
time when He was challenged, you must know

35:21.150 --> 35:28.150
when Mary Magdalene was beaten up, He stood
up. He had nothing to do with the prostitute,

35:28.220 --> 35:33.220
such a virtuous man, He was virtue personified,
He stood up, He said, “Those who have not

35:33.220 --> 35:38.710
committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me.”
He was sure nobody can do it because He was

35:38.710 --> 35:39.950
an authority of virtue.

35:39.950 --> 35:46.950
I, as I told you, I am just a woman and I
spoke openly with the names of these people

35:47.720 --> 35:53.490
and told of what they are going to do, and
how they are going to possess you. And people

35:53.490 --> 35:55.480
came, they were frightened, they said, “What
are You doing?”

35:55.480 --> 36:02.480
So you get rid of all your fear, but you do
not dominate anyone, you love, in your love

36:03.890 --> 36:10.890
you are secured. It is not by domination but
the security that you are love, you are compassion.

36:14.279 --> 36:21.279
And the power of love is the highest of all,
that you stand in complete peace and bliss.

36:23.730 --> 36:28.369
This happens to you when the central thing
comes up. There are many other things happen,

36:28.369 --> 36:33.250
you can become a poet, I mean so many things
happen with this, because you become such

36:33.250 --> 36:40.250
a compassion, such a compassion. And when
this compassion starts working you are given

36:41.000 --> 36:45.000
all the help that is needed.

36:45.000 --> 36:49.099
Then the another chakra - I am going a little
fast because after all you understand that

36:49.099 --> 36:55.109
there isn't much time today, I've been speaking,
and speaking every day, it’s a marathon

36:55.109 --> 37:02.109
race for Me, so I'll try to make it short
now - it's the Vishuddhi Chakra as he told

37:02.400 --> 37:09.400
you is very important, this is America. Vishuddhi
Chakra is America in the Universe. America

37:11.470 --> 37:18.470
is the Vishuddhi Chakra and the star is the
Saturn. There are seventeen of them, sixteen

37:22.970 --> 37:29.730
is the planet moving round, there are sixteen
centers there and the seventeenth is the Vishuddhi

37:29.730 --> 37:36.730
itself. Is a very important thing that this
center is America, so America has the responsibility

37:38.569 --> 37:45.569
of transformation. They have to take up the
responsibility of transforming the whole world.

37:47.829 --> 37:54.829
Instead of that they themselves are getting
ruined, they are killing themselves. There

37:55.140 --> 38:02.140
is no fear from outside I tell you, we are
going to be ruined from inside. What a responsibility

38:03.890 --> 38:09.799
you have and what we are doing you should
see to that. That’s why so many seekers

38:09.799 --> 38:16.799
are born here, but they do not feel the responsibility
of transformation. They will, one day it will

38:19.480 --> 38:26.480
come, they will have to feel it, once they
are awakened I'm sure they will feel that

38:26.769 --> 38:27.509
responsibility.

38:27.509 --> 38:34.509
This very important center as he must have
told you, by the virtue of this on the gross

38:37.589 --> 38:44.589
we develop a face which is very relaxed and
attractive and good looking. We develop eyes

38:47.309 --> 38:54.309
which are full of compassion; we develop a
face which is innocent, which is very smooth

38:58.440 --> 39:05.440
and which has got a capacity to express its
feeling. The smallest of feelings can be expressed

39:07.369 --> 39:13.859
through this center. It looks after your nose,
yours ears, everything improves with this.

39:13.859 --> 39:20.859
You develop - now I can't hear anything if
a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me. It is a very

39:21.250 --> 39:26.529
funny thing, unless and until that person
is very close I just can't hear what he is

39:26.529 --> 39:32.369
saying, to Me, it is all what you call “blah,
blah, blah.” But a Sahaja Yogi, if he speaks

39:32.369 --> 39:35.019
to Me I can hear very well.

39:35.019 --> 39:42.019
The whole thing changes, the whole sensitivity
changes, you start understanding what music

39:43.960 --> 39:50.960
is good for your Spirit; you start understanding
what is good for your eyes to see, because

39:54.269 --> 39:59.319
you don't want like to see that is something
that is horrid, you just don't enjoy it. You

39:59.319 --> 40:03.000
feel like vomiting - you see something horrid,
you just feel like vomiting. You become so

40:03.000 --> 40:07.950
sensitive you can't imagine, to virtue and
to goodness.

40:07.950 --> 40:14.680
Automatically it happens to you, I don't have
to tell you. I've seen people have changed

40:14.680 --> 40:21.680
overnight. The whole idea is that the light
has to be brought in for you to see for yourself,

40:21.690 --> 40:27.769
and when it happens you'll be amazed, you
become such a different, wonderful person.

40:27.769 --> 40:34.769
There's everyone in America has Abraham Lincoln
within them, which has to be just awakened

40:35.269 --> 40:42.269
and you'll find that that great personality
can be shown in you, when it happens to you.

40:43.430 --> 40:50.430
It has to happen to all of you to feel that
greatness that lies hidden within.

40:50.869 --> 40:56.210
I cannot elaborately tell you about Vishuddhi
Chakra what they call the Krishna consciousness,

40:56.210 --> 41:02.450
but not this Krishna consciousness which has
made people actual beggars, they are begging

41:02.450 --> 41:07.700
on the streets. You go in India in the villages,
about they were going to beat these people.

41:07.700 --> 41:11.749
They thought they are Krishna consciousness,
they wouldn’t get places in the hotels because

41:11.749 --> 41:15.670
they thought they are Krishna consciousness,
because these people were lost, they had no

41:15.670 --> 41:21.269
money left with them. Now they are begging
in India, imagine. How can we afford to have

41:21.269 --> 41:25.279
these beggars there? They have no money with
them, they can not come back, they don't know

41:25.279 --> 41:32.279
what to do with them, so many you will find
in the villages just begging. So this kind

41:32.999 --> 41:39.999
of thing that - imagine a person who is being
blessed by Shri Krishna Who is the Deity on

41:43.369 --> 41:45.829
this center, should beg!

41:45.829 --> 41:52.069
He's the One Who is the giver of complete
wealth, why should we beg? This is the thing

41:52.069 --> 41:58.009
they don't understand, just the opposite of
what they are suppose to be. There are lots

41:58.009 --> 42:04.430
of stories of Krishna how He blessed people
with wealth. It is to be seen sometimes, if

42:04.430 --> 42:09.579
you have time, I may have time then we might
be able to see all those beautiful things

42:09.579 --> 42:12.259
that He did.

42:12.259 --> 42:19.259
So the other chakra is important, is the Chakra
of Christ. This center is very important because

42:19.990 --> 42:25.680
this is the gate through this you have to
pass to your destination which is the limbic

42:25.680 --> 42:31.240
area. So Christ is the gate, many people are
shouting, “it's only He can save.” Where

42:31.240 --> 42:37.369
is He now? Is He here? When He was living,
they talked of Ibrahim, when He came then

42:37.369 --> 42:42.640
they said, “You are not the One. It was
Moses. You are not the One.”

42:42.640 --> 42:48.150
They denied Him, defied Him. Now when He's
dead, then we think, “It is Christ.” Now

42:48.150 --> 42:54.160
I have come, He's talked about Me, if you
read Bible you'll find He’s talked about

42:54.160 --> 42:59.210
Me very clearly there and I have to do My
job and I have come. You are going to say

42:59.210 --> 43:05.160
that it was Christ Who has to do it. If Christ
could do it, why did He say that “I'm going

43:05.160 --> 43:09.809
to send you a comforter”? He talked of future,
didn’t He? Why did He say such a thing?

43:09.809 --> 43:14.259
We should find out why did He say that “I
will send you the Holy Ghost and the Comforter

43:14.259 --> 43:19.259
and the Redeemer and a Counselor”? Why did
He say that? Why not look forward to that?

43:19.259 --> 43:24.700
Because we are today after Christ. People
don't want to see this point, they want to

43:24.700 --> 43:29.299
depend on Christ because He's in their pocket,
they can use Him the way they like.

43:29.299 --> 43:36.299
When He has talked, He has said, “Why not
see the point?” If this is what Christ is,

43:38.990 --> 43:45.509
then it is such a bad thing because people
say, “Christ was no good.” They say, “What

43:45.509 --> 43:51.470
has Christ given us?” Christians nations,
what have they done, what have they achieved?

43:51.470 --> 43:58.470
It's a bad name to Him if you do not see completion
of His work. I'm here to complete His work

43:59.819 --> 44:05.759
and when you do not complete His work, His
half-work done in a very half-way will bring

44:05.759 --> 44:06.900
bad name to Him.

44:06.900 --> 44:12.130
Why not people who claim about Christ understand
that what others have to say about it? If

44:12.130 --> 44:15.960
you want to know about Christians, go and
ask the Jews; and if you want to know about

44:15.960 --> 44:20.819
the Jews, go and ask the Muslims; and if you
want to know about the Muslims, go and ask

44:20.819 --> 44:27.819
the Hindus. There are all in a doldrum. Nobody
has any understanding that they are worshiping

44:28.099 --> 44:35.099
or they are admiring or advocating a flower
which belongs to one tree of life. They have

44:35.950 --> 44:42.749
all plucked those flowers, “This is mine,
this is mine, in my pocket,” and fighting.

44:42.749 --> 44:49.749
If religion means fighting and quarreling,
it is not a religion at all. If it is integration,

44:50.569 --> 44:52.869
then it is a religion.

44:52.869 --> 44:59.190
In Sahaja Yoga you'll find that they are all
together. Christ has said, very clearly, “Those

44:59.190 --> 45:06.190
who are not against Me are with Me.” Who
are those people? Try to find out. For that

45:07.069 --> 45:13.130
you have to little bit go out of Bible. In
the Bible how much do you have Christ there,

45:13.130 --> 45:18.529
for three years? Nobody allowed Him to live
for three years, and if they could, they would

45:18.529 --> 45:20.059
also kill Me.

45:20.059 --> 45:26.170
Not easy, He wanted to play the drama, otherwise
He would have finished all of them, in no

45:26.170 --> 45:33.170
time. So He has said that “You are to be
resurrected first, and then that's how you

45:33.599 --> 45:34.369
will be judged.”

45:34.369 --> 45:40.970
And the Day of Judgment is today, this is
the Day of Judgment, that's why you are confused,

45:40.970 --> 45:44.819
this is the Day of Judgment where you will
be judged and how are you going to be judged?

45:44.819 --> 45:51.730
Through your Kundalini. Your Kundalini is
going to be awakened and you'll be judged

45:51.730 --> 45:55.440
where you are. That's what it is, and those
who will be calling Me, “Christ, Christ”

45:55.440 --> 46:02.380
I will not look at them, that's what it is.
By calling Him “Christ, Christ” you do

46:02.380 --> 46:09.329
not become Christians, you have to get your
Realization, your baptism in the actual sense.

46:09.329 --> 46:14.259
It has to be an actualization. I'm telling
you that if you miss the point, you have missed

46:14.259 --> 46:21.259
it for ever and ever. Be careful on that point.
It's very important. Don't run after things

46:22.420 --> 46:29.420
which have no meaning to your consciousness.
Try to raise yourself up to this point and

46:29.940 --> 46:35.569
understand that the time has come for you
to transform, this is the time of your judgment

46:35.569 --> 46:41.910
and you have to get to it in a very big way.
The shallow things and all this will be finished.

46:41.910 --> 46:48.900
What is America or what is any country in
the eyes of God? Nothing. If they do not take

46:48.900 --> 46:55.900
to His ways, all will be treated like waste,
thoroughly waste, it's a wasteland. But if

46:56.059 --> 47:03.059
you rise, thousands and thousands and millions
and millions can be saved. Try to rise, try

47:04.460 --> 47:09.430
to understand your own responsibilities, that
is very important.

47:09.430 --> 47:16.430
Today is the last day and the last center
which is the Sahasrara, is the integration,

47:16.470 --> 47:23.470
integration of your being, of physical, mental,
emotional being, it takes place. Is integration

47:24.809 --> 47:31.009
of all the Deities, of all the Prophets, all
the great works that they have done, integration

47:31.009 --> 47:38.009
of all the scriptures, everything takes places
when this Sahasrara is opened out, when you

47:38.099 --> 47:39.759
become the Spirit.

47:39.759 --> 47:44.829
This is a much more difficult job, I know,
because if you don't have to transform people

47:44.829 --> 47:51.410
it is very easy to talk about it and get away.
But I have to transform, not only transform

47:51.410 --> 47:58.410
but you have to become, you cannot become
a Sahaji Yogi by paying Me, by saying things,

47:58.829 --> 48:04.180
by arguing, by showing up, you can only become
Sahaji Yogi by going within yourself, face

48:04.180 --> 48:11.180
up to it, see for yourself. I am here to help
you in every way possible. Whatever is possible

48:13.489 --> 48:17.789
we'll try to do it, but you all should also
understand your responsibility.

48:17.789 --> 48:24.720
It is not a joke now, it’s no more a joke.
It's not like Sunday morning you get up and

48:24.720 --> 48:30.460
go to church, or Monday morning you go somewhere
else in the temple, and Tuesday morning you

48:30.460 --> 48:37.460
go to see Siddhivinayaka [Temple of Shri Ganesha
- SG] and another day you go to a mosque.

48:37.569 --> 48:41.999
It is not like that. It is a very serious
thing which we must understand. We are at

48:41.999 --> 48:48.400
the brink of destruction, be careful about
it. We must do things so that the blessings

48:48.400 --> 48:54.079
of God comes to upon us and that we are saved.
It is a very serious thing, and the responsibility

48:54.079 --> 49:01.079
is much more on all the people who are getting
Realization, so do not treat it lightly. You

49:02.269 --> 49:04.499
all, I hope, will take it seriously.

49:04.499 --> 49:11.499
Thank God there is a nice seminar we are having
after this for three days, you can come down

49:11.940 --> 49:17.150
there, they have charged you very little,
we don't have to make any profit of out you,

49:17.150 --> 49:22.230
the only profit I can make is that you get
your profits, that's all. So please take it

49:22.230 --> 49:27.999
up seriously, work it out seriously, and I
tell you, out of you will come out those people

49:27.999 --> 49:34.730
who will build that foundations of that construction
which is going to come. Please don't waste

49:34.730 --> 49:38.140
your time in useless things, get to it.

49:38.140 --> 49:45.140
Any one of you can do it. I bless you with
My whole heart and know that I love you very

49:45.160 --> 49:50.380
much. If you have any problems, you can write
to Me, but don't write to Me about your family

49:50.380 --> 49:54.450
problems and this and that, it's a headache
to Me, there is no need to write. Of course

49:54.450 --> 49:58.589
I'm a mother, if you have problems you can
write but some people write ten pages saying,

49:58.589 --> 50:04.039
“my wife is fighting me.” It's bit too
much. You should write to Me about the problems

50:04.039 --> 50:10.029
which concern the whole country, concern the
whole world. Widen yourself and that’s how,

50:10.029 --> 50:16.559
though you may think that you are very unassuming
simple people, you are the ones who are going

50:16.559 --> 50:21.079
to be, not those who are successful, they
are blinded by their success; not those who

50:21.079 --> 50:25.710
are rich, they are not going to enter into
the Kingdom of God; not those who have a big

50:25.710 --> 50:32.710
name, no. It's you, you are going to enter
into the Kingdom

50:55.970 --> 51:02.970
of God.

51:06.299 --> 51:13.299
May God bless you.

51:47.630 --> 51:54.630
[Self Realization]

52:08.299 --> 52:15.299
Now, all the angels have a seat, now, put
your hands towards Me like this, and close

53:49.819 --> 53:54.309
your eyes, the vibrations are so much today,
nothing to do. Just so much vibrations tonight,

53:54.309 --> 54:01.309
it's tremendous. Just close your eyes, you'll
feel the cool breeze, most of you, close your

54:12.489 --> 54:16.269
eyes please.

54:16.269 --> 54:23.269
You just put your right hand on the head and
see if there is a cool breeze coming out,

54:26.410 --> 54:30.890
little higher, on top of your head.

54:30.890 --> 54:37.890
Hmm, it’s there. Now put your right hand
towards Me and put the left hand and see,

54:39.769 --> 54:46.769
little higher, about six inches higher, six
inches higher, change over, again, now put

55:04.680 --> 55:11.680
your hands up like this absolutely, close
the eyes and ask, “Is this the breeze of

55:16.460 --> 55:23.460
the Holy Ghost” or ask the question “Mother,
are You the Holy Ghost?

55:34.450 --> 55:41.450
You feel the cool breeze? Good, it's tremendous
today. May God bless you all.

55:51.690 --> 55:58.690
Those who have not felt any cool breeze, please
raise your hands. One, two and three. Are

56:00.950 --> 56:07.950
keeping all right? You are not well? All right,
doesn't matter, if you are not well maybe

56:16.720 --> 56:21.829
you may not feel today but you'll get well
and then you'll feel it, so it doesn't matter.

56:21.829 --> 56:27.150
There's one or two persons who have not felt
it, it’s so tremendous today, May God bless

56:27.150 --> 56:28.130
you.

56:28.130 --> 56:35.130
You may give your addresses to these people,
let them know where you are, also you can

56:37.140 --> 56:42.509
take address for the seminar, if you want
to come, they are going to arrange a transport

56:42.509 --> 56:48.160
for you to go to Santa Cruz. Thank you very
much.

56:48.160 --> 56:55.160
I say goodbye to you, after a year I’ll
definitely will come to Los Angeles again,

56:57.140 --> 56:59.930
those who haven't cool breeze should keep
their hands raised. These boys will come and

56:59.930 --> 57:05.170
see you. All right, those people who haven't
got it, please keep your hands slightly raised

57:05.170 --> 57:12.170
so some people will come and see you, little
higher so that they'll come and see you. Here

57:17.749 --> 57:18.339
just have a look.

57:18.339 --> 57:21.380
Man in the Audience: I didn’t hear Your
last question. I didn’t understand what

57:21.380 --> 57:21.630
You asked about the Holy Ghost.

57:21.380 --> 57:28.380
Shri Mataji: Just to know that I am the Holy
Ghost.

57:30.049 --> 57:34.799
Man in the Audience: You are Holy Ghost?

57:34.799 --> 57:36.950
Shri Mataji: Yes. Otherwise how will you recognize?

57:36.950 --> 57:42.749
Man in the Audience: The Bible says that God
is the Holy Ghost.

57:42.749 --> 57:46.989
Shri Mataji: Bible never says that. You don’t
understand that. You don’t teach Me Bible.

57:46.989 --> 57:53.989
[Man keeps interrupting Shri Mataji] It doesn’t
say. You don’t tell Me. You have no knowledge.

58:25.539 --> 58:32.539
Don’t disturb others. If you are such a
good person you ...
