00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.430
Dr. Warren has already talked to you

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:44.680
about the different centers that we have within
ourselves, and you can see how beautifully

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.860
they are placed and how gradually when the
Kundalini rises, how She enlightens the innermost

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.390
core of the centers. There are three channels
in the central channel, and the innermost

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:19.060
channel is used by Kundalini to pierce through
for the first time. You can imagine Kundalini

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.720
to be made of many strands of energy tied
together just like a rope, and as the chakras

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:46.730
start opening more strands start getting awakened
and they pierce through these six centers;

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.910
but if a person after Realization just thinks
that he has got the Realization, then he doesn't

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:10.989
have to bother about it, may lose it for the
time being, for quite some time I should say,

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:19.019
and he'll have to work much harder to re-establish
his Self Realization.

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:27.799
I've seen many-a-times when we give Realization
to people they say, “Yes, we have felt it.”

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:36.169
They did feel it, everything happens, and
then they loose it because they have not established

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.130
their Realization properly, for which luckily
in every place wherever I go I see to it that

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.600
we already have a center established, then
you can go to that center and you can learn

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:04.859
from them how to establish your Realization.
That is a very, very important time which

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.040
must be taken into consideration.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:16.040
There was a lady who had cancer, she was cured
of her cancer, she was perfectly all right

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:25.389
and she went back to her family, she was doing
very well, and after some time - a year or

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:37.169
so - she came back with another disease of
a very serious nature.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.300
So I asked her, “How is it that you are
cured of cancer, now you get another disease?

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.790
Did you do anything about it?”

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:51.479
“No, Mother, I went back from here, everybody
says, ‘You are looking very fine.’ They

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:57.720
are all right, they were all quite surprised
how I was cured, and I never bothered to do

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.840
anything about it.”

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:06.840
So she got another trouble. You go on like
this, you cure one thing then you again cure

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:16.229
another thing. Like little children, you clean
them, then again they get out and soil their

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.310
clothes, again they are back in the bathroom,
then again you clean them, again they do the

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:29.310
same thing. So you have to mature, after Realization
you must in all wisdom and sensible behavior,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:37.280
you must mature of it, otherwise it is a big
headache to Me and big headache to you, and

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:44.280
you can be quite lost also with it, because
if a seed is half-sprouted it is of no use

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.610
at all.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:54.610
So if you want that you should really have
the complete bliss of Self Realization, you

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:02.020
have to become a little serious person about
it. Shallow temperament is not going to help

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.250
you, or looking at it as if like another guru
shopping business it is not going to work

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.960
out. You have to work to see that you establish
yourself, till you have established you are

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:19.729
not to work on other people but once you are
established you can start working on other

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:26.729
people, giving them Realization. There is
no need then for you to bother that you will

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:33.800
catch from others, or anything; but before
that you should not try to help others. First

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:40.449
help yourself, selfishness to begin with.
Unless and until you are all right and you

00:06:40.449 --> 00:06:47.449
know all the methods of protecting yourself,
you are not to indulge into Sahaja Yoga practices

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:55.469
which helps others. But when you become an
expert, when you have an expertise then you

00:06:56.569 --> 00:07:02.629
should do it. Like a mechanic who doesn’t
know how to repair a car, they spoil it more.

00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:07.490
So better become an expert for which you don't
have to pay anything, you don't have to do

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:13.759
much about it but only to understand how you
have to move the Kundalini within you, how

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:20.759
you have to establish it back, what problems
you have and how you have to cure. You will

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:27.520
be surprised you won't be aware of problems
that you have.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.639
One gentleman came and told Me, “Mother
everyone is coming and asking me, ‘what

00:07:32.639 --> 00:07:35.069
about your father, what's the problem?’”

00:07:35.069 --> 00:07:37.629
I said, “Everybody said the same?”

00:07:37.629 --> 00:07:38.949
He said, “Yes.”

00:07:38.949 --> 00:07:41.439
I said, “I also want to know, what about
your father?”

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:47.759
He said, “My father died very early in life,
and I always had a feeling that I had no father.”

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:54.759
That can be cured, and he developed asthma
with it, so everybody knows, those who know

00:07:54.770 --> 00:08:01.520
one thing that is the truth about you. All
of them will say the same thing, even if it

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.819
is a small child, he will also come and ask
you that “Is your father all right?” Because

00:08:06.819 --> 00:08:12.439
if he knows that this center, this center
on the right hand side means the father. So

00:08:12.439 --> 00:08:19.389
he will also say the same and then he will
come and ask you, “what about your father?”

00:08:19.389 --> 00:08:26.389
It is so remarkable sometimes the way people
see these things that they can't believe it,

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:31.569
but this is nothing, what you get is just
a wee bit of it.

00:08:31.569 --> 00:08:38.569
But as Kundalini rises, on every center you
start getting the light of that center. At

00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:47.180
the first center you get back your innocence,
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:56.890
innocent, you are not filled with lust and
greed, you don't look at things with lust

00:08:56.890 --> 00:09:03.850
and greed, but you look at things with innocence,
which is a very big thing that people have

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:10.850
lost and that you get back and such a person
develops many qualities. One of them is that

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:18.350
such a person is full of fragrance, such a
person has a tremendous gravity, tremendous

00:09:21.940 --> 00:09:28.940
gravity, and such a person has tremendous
dynamism, and attraction is a bad word so

00:09:30.560 --> 00:09:34.370
I don't want to use it, but magnetical.

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:41.370
His magnets is awakened within him, this is
the center of your magnet of the earth. Such

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:50.380
a person develops a tremendous sense of roots
and sense of direction, you place him anywhere

00:09:52.149 --> 00:09:58.079
he will know where to go. Like birds, you
place birds anywhere they know which side

00:09:58.079 --> 00:10:05.079
is north, south, east, west. In the same way
you also develop your lost innocence and your

00:10:07.110 --> 00:10:13.320
magnet within you by which you have proper
direction; but the highest of all you develop

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:20.320
the proper direction to wisdom which is the
wise thing to do. You just don't do stupid

00:10:21.190 --> 00:10:28.190
things, you just don't do, even if you ever
try to do it, you will not do it, because

00:10:28.209 --> 00:10:35.209
you know it is so stupid, just you don't do
it. I mean it is so simple to be wise than

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.779
to be stupid, because if you have to be stupid
you have to go out of the way to be stupid

00:10:43.779 --> 00:10:50.779
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal
and wise is the easiest thing to do. But what

00:10:51.180 --> 00:10:58.180
people do is to do things that would make
them more and more stupid, nonsensical, because

00:11:00.779 --> 00:11:07.779
also some people told Me they do it, the reason
being they think they have a nuisance value.

00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:15.170
Like in London now we have one funny stuff
going on, they call it what? “Punk rock.”

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:20.630
You see, it's a funny stuff. Now poor kids
they don't know what they are doing it, and

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:27.630
I think the only value of that punk rock system
is this: that they try to sort of make a nuisance

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:38.500
out of them so that people feel attracted
towards them or sort of a significance out

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:45.329
of them. But when you become a realized soul
you realize your significance, because you

00:11:45.329 --> 00:11:52.329
understand you are part and parcel of the
whole and that your significance is to give

00:11:52.519 --> 00:11:59.519
Realization to others, the highest of highest,
that's what you have to do now you are a saint,

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:06.790
and that’s how the whole attitude of cheapiness,
of outward shallowness finishes and you become

00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:16.050
a serene, dignified personality. This is not
possible through any sermon, any lecture,

00:12:16.209 --> 00:12:23.209
it's only possible when the Kundalini rises
you become like a very dignified child, very

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:27.000
dignified child.

00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:34.000
I've seen one beautiful painting done of Mother
Mary being taught first time. You see Her

00:12:37.399 --> 00:12:43.269
as a child, She is a very dignified personality,
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

00:12:43.269 --> 00:12:50.269
I've seen My own grandchildren who are not
very old but extremely dignified. They walk

00:12:50.399 --> 00:12:56.769
like kings, behave like kings. In every behavior
you find there's such a dignity, they'll never

00:12:56.769 --> 00:13:02.029
do something shallow, they never ask for anything,
they never weep for anything, they never cry

00:13:02.029 --> 00:13:08.079
for anything, they are so dignified and they
understand it so well what is dignity is.

00:13:08.079 --> 00:13:14.230
I don't have to tell them, because they are
born realized, in the same way you become,

00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:18.680
nobody has to tell you that “do this, or
do that,” but you understand that you must

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:25.680
have self-respect. This happens to you automatically,
this is actualization, nobody has to tell

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:30.870
you that “you be dignified,” you just
become. I've seen people who were absolutely

00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:36.759
absurd, even from this punk rock we got some
people and they were so changed that people

00:13:36.759 --> 00:13:41.880
could not recognize them, but one thing bad
has happened with this punk rock that they

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:48.000
put some sort of dye in their head and since
then their eyes became very weak, because

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:55.000
these dyes I think made the optic globe covered
with some sort of a color and you can't see

00:13:56.079 --> 00:14:01.720
properly, and the eyes became very weak and
it took some time for us to remove the effect

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:04.220
of those dyes from their head.

00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:09.360
We go headlong, “what's wrong?” There
is nothing wrong in this world if it is a

00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:15.670
stupid fool, but for a wise man there are
very many things which are absolutely wrong,

00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:22.670
and there are very many things which are absolutely
correct, so you develop your wisdom by this

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.170
first center.

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:31.170
Now as the Kundalini rises She enlightens
your second center which we can call as the

00:14:31.730 --> 00:14:36.490
Swadishthan Chakra for the time being, though
it is the third center. But second center,

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:43.490
you become extremely creative, extremely creative.
I know of a gentleman who came to Me, he had

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:46.009
no job.

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:48.649
And he said, “Mother, I have no job and
what should I do?”

00:14:48.649 --> 00:14:51.230
I said, “All right, what do you want to
do?”

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:52.850
He said, “Whatever you say.”

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.560
I said, “All right, why don't you become
an interior decorator?”

00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:01.750
He said, “Me? I don't know what is a teak
wood, I don’t know what is a rose wood,

00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:03.670
how am I to become an interior decorator?”

00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:06.360
I said, “You just use your vibrations.”

00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.480
And you'll be surprised he earned million
of rupees out of that profession because you

00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:18.480
become extremely creative, your sense of creation
becomes so subtle and so beautiful that you

00:15:20.009 --> 00:15:26.160
start understanding art at such a high level
that people don't know how, when you are not

00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:33.110
educated in art, how you can do it. I went
to Japan once, and they were having an Ikebana

00:15:33.110 --> 00:15:37.959
competition or something, so I went to see
the Ikebana class and they requested Me, “Why

00:15:37.959 --> 00:15:39.569
don't you do some flower arrangements?”

00:15:39.569 --> 00:15:41.690
I said, “All right, I'll do.”

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:48.069
I did it and I got the highest marks without
knowing a word about Ikebana, just surprise

00:15:48.069 --> 00:15:54.180
Me, I got the highest mark. I can do lots
of things which I've never done before like

00:15:54.180 --> 00:15:59.410
architecture. I have built houses without
doing any architecture, I've done decorations

00:15:59.410 --> 00:16:06.410
of the houses, I've done all kinds of things
without knowing how to it, because you become

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.120
you so creative.

00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:13.310
Music you start understanding so much better.
There are people now in America, there's a

00:16:13.310 --> 00:16:19.310
girl, she had a horrible hoarse voice, absolutely
hoarse voice, and she always used to go out

00:16:19.310 --> 00:16:20.560
of tune.

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:24.160
So I told her, “You shouldn’t sing songs
before Me because it’s rather funny.”

00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:27.279
She said, “Mother, why don't You give me
a good voice?”

00:16:27.279 --> 00:16:32.279
I said, “You just try your Vishuddhi Chakra,
if your Vishuddhi Chakra is corrected you'll

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:34.389
be all right.”

00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:40.740
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Why don’t you
sit down.]

00:16:40.740 --> 00:16:47.170
So the Vishuddhi Chakra was … she tried
on Vishuddhi Chakra giving vibrations, and

00:16:47.170 --> 00:16:54.170
she sings so melodiously now that I tell you
she can be a great singer. So the creativity,

00:16:54.170 --> 00:17:01.170
that also is a blessing of your power of the
Goddess of learning. Boys who could not study

00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:08.730
in the schools were absolutely duffers. Some
people brought this boy, recently I’ve received

00:17:08.730 --> 00:17:09.780
a letter from him.

00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:13.560
When he came to Me, his father said that “He
is going to be taken out of school because

00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:17.550
he's good for nothing, he can not remember
anything, he's absolutely finished.”

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:22.140
I said, “All right, doesn't matter, let
him take to Sahaja Yoga.”

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:28.360
He got his Realization. Not only that he passed
with first class, but he got a scholarship.

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:35.360
Then he passed another exam, he got a scholarship.
Now he's got a very big job, at a very young

00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:41.390
age. He wrote to Me, “Mother no one can
believe that a duffer like me has been so

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:47.560
much highly placed.” All the boys who got
scholarships in Maharashtra in schools, in

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.850
colleges and universities are Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:58.440
It is such a tremendous force that starts
working in you, if you try to give vibrations

00:17:58.440 --> 00:18:05.440
say to fruits or to trees or to say wheat
and such things which are very important for

00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:17.940
life, any food, you will be amazed that the
food also grows so much more and the taste

00:18:19.690 --> 00:18:26.460
is so good and it lasts you so longer. Like
one gentleman tried, a university professor

00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:33.460
in agricultural college on some wheat, some
vibrations and he was amazed that when they

00:18:34.140 --> 00:18:40.350
collected this wheat it was at least six times
more than normal, and when this wheat was

00:18:40.350 --> 00:18:47.350
stored in a big hall like this, there were
so many other things, the rats who are always

00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.770
a menace in India never touched that wheat.
They ate all the rest of it but never touched

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:57.100
the wheat.

00:18:57.100 --> 00:19:04.100
Even the animals - the snails, even the tigers,
of course the dogs and the cats - understand

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:11.580
it much more, they understand you, they know
that you are a saint. They'll never touch

00:19:11.580 --> 00:19:16.300
you, they will never trouble you. Even a tiger
sees a saint, he never attacks. You can handle

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:21.770
a tiger very easily; this is the power of
a saint. So you develop a tremendous capacity

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:28.770
of creativity. The greatest capacity you have
then is of creating a new human being out

00:19:31.990 --> 00:19:38.810
of a ordinary human being. This is the greatest
blessing that you have, that you transform

00:19:38.810 --> 00:19:45.810
an egg into a bird and that is the epitome,
that is the spiritual power you have, by which

00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:53.060
you can transform the whole human race into
a new race which has this fifth dimension

00:19:54.620 --> 00:19:57.320
within yourself.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:02.630
You can start talking on science now, we have
a scientist here and he's a done his science,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:08.170
he is a Doctor of Science in this and that,
in chemistry and I explained to him about

00:20:08.170 --> 00:20:12.690
this - where is the hydrogen and oxygen and
nitrogen and all that within us and he was

00:20:12.690 --> 00:20:12.990
amazed.

00:20:12.990 --> 00:20:15.980
He said, “Mother, how do you know all these
things?”

00:20:15.980 --> 00:20:20.970
I said, “I don't know how I know, but I
know. That’s what it is, you just have a

00:20:20.970 --> 00:20:22.030
look at this.”

00:20:22.030 --> 00:20:27.970
And he was amazed how I was telling him about
spiral movement and linear movement of peptose.

00:20:27.970 --> 00:20:30.110
He said that “For this I had to study so
much.”

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.070
I said, “For Sahaja Yog you don't have to
study.” A little bit you know and immediately

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:39.310
you click the point. Now this is the second
thing that you know in your learnings, in

00:20:39.310 --> 00:20:44.670
your education you are all right, but the
mastery of this center comes, the mastery

00:20:44.670 --> 00:20:51.670
of this center comes when you know the pure
knowledge, the pure knowledge of handling

00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:58.750
the Kundalini, the pure knowledge of Spirit,
the pure knowledge of the blessings of God,

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:05.900
of Ritambhara Pragya. If you know that, that
is the highest that you achieve gradually

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:12.900
as you grow, because when these centers starts
expanding on the sides, you start expanding

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:20.140
in your personality, in your sensitivity and
in your evolutionary ascent, so that is how

00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:25.710
you start growing from one to another to another
to another.

00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:31.460
Now the third center that we have actually,
this is the second center because the third

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:38.460
center arises, this Swadishthana arises out
of the Nabhi, is a very, very important center,

00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:45.980
is the center of your seeking as he has told
you. Your compete priorities change, complete

00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:52.530
priorities change, because the joy that you
get out of Sahaja Yoga, the joy you get out

00:21:52.530 --> 00:21:59.530
of this meditation, out of the feeling that
grows in you all the time, like a beautiful

00:22:02.330 --> 00:22:09.330
torrential rain of joy that fills you, your
life and everybody's life, you don't care

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:18.120
for cheap type of entertainment. You feel,
you seek other Sahaja Yogi, you want to meet

00:22:20.410 --> 00:22:24.130
another Sahaja Yogi, you don't want to meet
anybody else. If there is an actor coming,

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:28.410
or some big man is coming, “All right, let
him come, I'm going to see such and such person.”

00:22:28.410 --> 00:22:35.410
It is such a different personality that one
day - I will tell you how it happens - there

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.280
was a girl, a diplomat, she's a diplomat who
is a realized soul and she happened to go

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:46.590
to Sicily. And she was eating her food, suddenly
she felt there is some vibrations coming down,

00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:53.020
she looked around, the other one was also
looking at her, she said, “Are you Mataji's

00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:53.560
disciple?”

00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.940
And she said, “Yes, I am Mataji's child.”

00:22:56.940 --> 00:23:03.360
They both got up and just hugged and said,
“Such joy Mother in that far-fetched place

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.790
of Sicily to find a Sahaja Yogi.”

00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:10.800
And then they stayed together and they wouldn’t
go anywhere else but they said, “Now this

00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:15.350
is the enjoyment.” Just the company of a
Sahaja Yogi is such an enjoyment.

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:21.100
I've seen these people when they go to India,
the people are not so rich, poor people - they

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:25.090
have little, little huts - but when they go
they go there, you should see the love, the

00:23:25.090 --> 00:23:32.090
rapport, and that makes Me so happy, so happy,
the way they love each other, the way they

00:23:32.370 --> 00:23:38.780
understand each other, the way they help each
other and the only the company, for the first

00:23:38.780 --> 00:23:45.780
time they start enjoying. We were once in
a hotel staying in Calcutta and with two Sahaja

00:23:46.350 --> 00:23:50.080
Yogi with Me. They were in the other room,
quite far away, they could not get a room

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:56.030
close to Me, and one gentleman came for his
Realization, he came to My feet, when he got

00:23:56.030 --> 00:24:00.750
his Realization it was a tremendous happening
and they came rushing from there.

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:02.110
I said, “What happened?”

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:07.110
They said, “We felt the vibrations, we felt
the vibrations from there, Mother, so we have

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:09.490
come to receive the vibrations.”

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:16.490
And they came and they felt the vibrations.
So this man was so great that his vibrations

00:24:16.770 --> 00:24:22.750
attracted them and they came down. They were
just enjoying that as if they were enjoying

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:26.750
a big flower with lots of fragrance. What
vibrations, what vibrations! The fellow got

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:33.750
up and said, “Very nice. They are enjoying
my vibrations. Now I'm going to enjoy your

00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:34.480
vibrations.”

00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:41.480
For the first time you start enjoying your
fellow man because everyone is a beautiful

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:50.090
personality, a glorious, fragrant, joyful
personality; but because you cannot feel the

00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:56.650
other person, and because the other person
does not emit, you are all the time quarreling.

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.950
Even husband-wife quarreling, father-mother
quarreling, this one quarreling, that quarreling.

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:06.110
In Sahaja Yoga there is hardly any time for
people to quarrel. The other day I had a lady

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:10.940
who came to see Me, and she was trying to
put her point and there were about five-six

00:25:10.940 --> 00:25:16.640
Sahaja Yogis, and everybody was putting the
same point and she was amazed.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:22.700
She said, “I've never seen such concord,
such friendship, such understanding, all of

00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.980
them supporting each other, nobody is cutting
anyone.”

00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:34.600
Such a society has to develop. It’s such
a nourishing, soothing, invigorating society,

00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:41.600
and you forget about getting bored, boredom
goes out of life, you never get bored, you

00:25:41.770 --> 00:25:47.330
enjoy yourself or you enjoy the company of
Sahaja Yogis and it is very different level

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:53.610
that you come of - that is what, that land
you have to reach within yourself.

00:25:53.610 --> 00:26:00.610
Now the greatest thing that happens as a result
of this center seeking, that you start seeking

00:26:01.020 --> 00:26:07.830
other seekers, you try to find out “where
is the seeker?” If you hear somebody is

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:13.560
a seeker, you go and see. If you hear about
someone that some people are lost there, they

00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:19.730
were seekers, but they went there lost, you
all rush there. It is like a person who is

00:26:19.730 --> 00:26:26.730
like a, what you call a guard on the seashore
you know, there are guards kept for salvaging

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:34.450
people, and that is how you become. You suddenly
see somebody sinking, you just go. In Bombay

00:26:34.990 --> 00:26:39.320
there was a case they announce that “there’s
a lady who is going to die, if somebody can

00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.850
come and help her, it will be a great thing.”
They all rushed there; they saved her.

00:26:44.850 --> 00:26:51.010
Now the interests changes completely, and
you start really helping people and not feeling

00:26:51.010 --> 00:26:58.010
that you are helping them, not at all. But
the surrounding portion of that, which is

00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:06.280
the void, is the best, which is affected by
your awakening, that you become the virtue

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:13.660
itself. Nobody has to tell you that you be
virtuous, when you are awakened you become

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:21.910
a virtuous person, you enjoy your virtues,
you enjoy being good, you enjoy being nice,

00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:33.230
you really enjoy it. And that enjoyment comes
to you as a blessing because the virtue itself

00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:40.560
is so strengthening, so powerful that anyone
who is harmed or troubled or tortured or put

00:27:44.690 --> 00:27:51.690
down, you stand up, you are not afraid of
anyone, you are not afraid of any one of them.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:28:00.100
Now about these people who have been troubling
you as fake gurus, I told about them in 1970.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:07.320
I'm just a lady and single-handed I told them
who these people are, how they are going to

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:13.180
loot you, and what they are going to do; but
in this country nobody can think of one genuine

00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:20.180
person who could be really genuine. It was
the problem that time, but with this awakening

00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:26.340
within you of the virtuous nature, you just
know what is virtue and what is not virtue.

00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:32.690
I don't have to tell you; I don't say “don't
do this, don't do that.” I never say that,

00:28:32.690 --> 00:28:39.690
it just happens, because when the virtue starts
developing, the vibrations improve and you

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:46.820
feel extremely joyous. We have lost our virtues
because there is no joy out of it, no reward.

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:56.790
If somebody is honest, he has to suffer; if
somebody's good, he has to suffer; is somebody's

00:28:56.790 --> 00:29:03.790
kind, he thinks he has to suffer; but after
getting Realization you are rewarded for your

00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:05.170
virtues.

00:29:05.170 --> 00:29:10.900
You are amazed how you are paid for it, it’s
so surprising, like once there was a lady

00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:16.020
who came to see Me, she was a refugee, and
I had a big house.

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.420
So I said, “All right come and stay with
Me.”

00:29:18.420 --> 00:29:22.020
So My husband, My brother they came, they
said, “What's this? You don't know her,

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:25.700
who she is, her husband, whether he is her
husband or not, just given her two rooms.

00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:26.470
It's not good!”

00:29:26.470 --> 00:29:30.630
I said, “Let it be, doesn’t matter. I
know for nothing is going to happen, let her

00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:31.330
be here.”

00:29:31.330 --> 00:29:33.850
So they wouldn't also go against Me. They
said, “All right, if you say so.”

00:29:33.850 --> 00:29:40.170
This lady stayed for ten days and went away.
Then she become a very well-known actress

00:29:40.170 --> 00:29:44.570
in India, I didn't know she was the same lady,
but somebody told Me that she is the same

00:29:44.570 --> 00:29:45.720
lady. I said, “Maybe.”

00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:51.130
Then one day you see, they wanted to make
a film for our Sahaja Yoga, so they said,

00:29:51.130 --> 00:29:54.580
“We can ask this lady to act, because she
is a good actress.”

00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.910
I said, “All right, you can go ask but don't
tell her I am here, otherwise she will have

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:01.870
no choice. I will not go and see her. You
just ask her.”

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.580
They went and ask her, they said, “Will
you be actress?” and all that.

00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:06.950
She said, “I'll try.” This, that she was
saying.

00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:12.250
But on the day on when they were going to
open the film I went there, she saw Me, she

00:30:12.250 --> 00:30:17.090
was so amazed, she said, “Oh God, You are
the One, You are the One Who is sponsoring

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:19.840
this, Oh, I’ll give my life for Her!”
She just came forward, she said, “Have anything

00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:26.720
you like, I have nothing to say, I am so sorry
that you never told me that She's there.”

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:32.340
Thousand times more she rewarded a little
thing I did for her.

00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:38.620
No more cheating, no more troubling, you become
a wonderful person and so many people become

00:30:38.620 --> 00:30:43.630
your friends in this world. Your have to just
tell you are coming, there will hundred people

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:48.220
at the airport to receive you. There will
be so many friends all over the world for

00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:54.110
you, you will be amazed. It's such a tremendous
thing happens, because now you all are awakened

00:30:54.110 --> 00:31:00.240
in that Primordial Being and you have become
one with each other. You can feel it, that

00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:05.740
oneness, that unison that we are all not only
human beings but we are yogis, we are super

00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:11.720
human beings, and we have to look after the
whole world. That feeling of compassion is

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:18.720
so overwhelming that all little, little stupid
things just fall off, there's no place for

00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.880
that. This actually happens and has happened
with many.

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.390
Dr. Warren, whom you have seen here, can tell
you as I have told you lots of stories, but

00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:33.190
there are many, some of them were so hot tempered,
some of them were so quarrelsome, some them

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.230
used to fight so much in the beginning that
I thought, “How are they going to be all

00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:44.100
right?” But today I find them as great friends
and very great yogis. So this is the center

00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:49.610
where your religion is awakened. And what
is a religion? Word comes from “religo,”

00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:55.140
in Sanskrit it means dharma, “Dhariyatisa
Dharma,” the sustenance, your sustenance,

00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:01.530
your valances is your religion. As every atom,
carbon has four valances, and in the same

00:32:01.530 --> 00:32:07.400
way you have ten valances, these are the ten
commandments that were told to you and you

00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:14.400
become that, you just become. I don't have
to tell you as commandments but they become

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:21.870
your beautiful ornaments within yourself.
This happens automatically, so spontaneously

00:32:21.870 --> 00:32:23.020
you become that.

00:32:23.020 --> 00:32:28.920
A bishop came to see Me the other day, he
is a relation of Mine, My brother. He came

00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:34.530
to see Me, and he was rather adamant and little
angry when he came to see Me because he thought,

00:32:34.530 --> 00:32:37.080
“Why am I trying to do this kind of thing?”

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:41.500
But when he saw the Sahaja Yogis he said,
“I'm amazed, you know, I've been giving

00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:47.750
lectures in the church for years together,
but I could not achieve anything. How have

00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:53.980
You transformed these people? The drug addicts
have suddenly become such good people that

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.840
they have given up drugs, alcoholics have
given up alcohol. How is it without telling

00:32:58.840 --> 00:32:59.340
them anything?”

00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:05.450
I said, “Everything is within them. As soon
as the light comes you can see everything.

00:33:05.450 --> 00:33:08.820
You know that this is on your way, this is
against your progress, this is anti-life,

00:33:08.820 --> 00:33:13.570
you just give up. Only thing you have to have
the light within you.”

00:33:13.570 --> 00:33:20.280
So he himself was surprised at this and then
he said, “Really, that should be done, is

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.340
to transform them.”

00:33:21.340 --> 00:33:26.230
But I said, “You do not transform them by
giving them big sermons, you transform them

00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:33.230
by giving them the real second birth, real
baptism.” And I must say that Calvinist,

00:33:33.610 --> 00:33:39.240
of all the persons, Calvinist in Geneva have
accepted Me and they think that this is the

00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.170
only way they can transform you.

00:33:41.170 --> 00:33:48.170
You will be amazed the Calvinist of all the
persons who are such I should say one-sided

00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:55.280
people, they have accepted to see the result
of everybody who is open-minded person, who

00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.400
thinks for the good of others and not for
money-making and for selfish ends. We'll see

00:34:01.400 --> 00:34:07.100
one day that this is the way it has to be.
God has given us this power, we have got a

00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:12.190
Spirit within us, we should try to awaken
that and we should accept it, not because

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:18.869
I'm doing it, you can do it also. So this
thing happens to you with this chakra.

00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:23.849
Now with the another chakra on top, that is
one - as he has told the diseases, I'm telling

00:34:23.849 --> 00:34:30.020
you the positive side of it - when this chakra
is caught up he must have told you, you develop

00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:37.020
breast cancer and all that. But when it is
awakened, you get all the security of the

00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:44.730
world, you are never insecure, you are never
bothered, you have no fear of anyone. You

00:34:46.659 --> 00:34:50.589
do not have to suggest yourself that “you
should not have fear or anything,” you just

00:34:50.589 --> 00:34:57.589
become fearless, there is no nothing like
fear, there's no reaction to any threat or

00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:03.289
anything. Like the gentleman who came here,
just to beat Me now, I was just looking at

00:35:03.289 --> 00:35:08.130
the drum, and the fellow was getting frightened
of Me, he was going backwards, backwards,

00:35:08.130 --> 00:35:14.440
he would not come forward. But you don't develop
any fear of at all about anyone, because you

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:21.150
are standing on truth, like Christ. At the
time when He was challenged, you must know

00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:28.150
when Mary Magdalene was beaten up, He stood
up. He had nothing to do with the prostitute,

00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:33.220
such a virtuous man, He was virtue personified,
He stood up, He said, “Those who have not

00:35:33.220 --> 00:35:38.710
committed any sin, can throw a stone at Me.”
He was sure nobody can do it because He was

00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:39.950
an authority of virtue.

00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:46.950
I, as I told you, I am just a woman and I
spoke openly with the names of these people

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:53.490
and told of what they are going to do, and
how they are going to possess you. And people

00:35:53.490 --> 00:35:55.480
came, they were frightened, they said, “What
are You doing?”

00:35:55.480 --> 00:36:02.480
So you get rid of all your fear, but you do
not dominate anyone, you love, in your love

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:10.890
you are secured. It is not by domination but
the security that you are love, you are compassion.

00:36:14.279 --> 00:36:21.279
And the power of love is the highest of all,
that you stand in complete peace and bliss.

00:36:23.730 --> 00:36:28.369
This happens to you when the central thing
comes up. There are many other things happen,

00:36:28.369 --> 00:36:33.250
you can become a poet, I mean so many things
happen with this, because you become such

00:36:33.250 --> 00:36:40.250
a compassion, such a compassion. And when
this compassion starts working you are given

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:45.000
all the help that is needed.

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.099
Then the another chakra - I am going a little
fast because after all you understand that

00:36:49.099 --> 00:36:55.109
there isn't much time today, I've been speaking,
and speaking every day, it’s a marathon

00:36:55.109 --> 00:37:02.109
race for Me, so I'll try to make it short
now - it's the Vishuddhi Chakra as he told

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:09.400
you is very important, this is America. Vishuddhi
Chakra is America in the Universe. America

00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:18.470
is the Vishuddhi Chakra and the star is the
Saturn. There are seventeen of them, sixteen

00:37:22.970 --> 00:37:29.730
is the planet moving round, there are sixteen
centers there and the seventeenth is the Vishuddhi

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:36.730
itself. Is a very important thing that this
center is America, so America has the responsibility

00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:45.569
of transformation. They have to take up the
responsibility of transforming the whole world.

00:37:47.829 --> 00:37:54.829
Instead of that they themselves are getting
ruined, they are killing themselves. There

00:37:55.140 --> 00:38:02.140
is no fear from outside I tell you, we are
going to be ruined from inside. What a responsibility

00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:09.799
you have and what we are doing you should
see to that. That’s why so many seekers

00:38:09.799 --> 00:38:16.799
are born here, but they do not feel the responsibility
of transformation. They will, one day it will

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:26.480
come, they will have to feel it, once they
are awakened I'm sure they will feel that

00:38:26.769 --> 00:38:27.509
responsibility.

00:38:27.509 --> 00:38:34.509
This very important center as he must have
told you, by the virtue of this on the gross

00:38:37.589 --> 00:38:44.589
we develop a face which is very relaxed and
attractive and good looking. We develop eyes

00:38:47.309 --> 00:38:54.309
which are full of compassion; we develop a
face which is innocent, which is very smooth

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:05.440
and which has got a capacity to express its
feeling. The smallest of feelings can be expressed

00:39:07.369 --> 00:39:13.859
through this center. It looks after your nose,
yours ears, everything improves with this.

00:39:13.859 --> 00:39:20.859
You develop - now I can't hear anything if
a non-Sahaja Yogi speaks to Me. It is a very

00:39:21.250 --> 00:39:26.529
funny thing, unless and until that person
is very close I just can't hear what he is

00:39:26.529 --> 00:39:32.369
saying, to Me, it is all what you call “blah,
blah, blah.” But a Sahaja Yogi, if he speaks

00:39:32.369 --> 00:39:35.019
to Me I can hear very well.

00:39:35.019 --> 00:39:42.019
The whole thing changes, the whole sensitivity
changes, you start understanding what music

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:50.960
is good for your Spirit; you start understanding
what is good for your eyes to see, because

00:39:54.269 --> 00:39:59.319
you don't want like to see that is something
that is horrid, you just don't enjoy it. You

00:39:59.319 --> 00:40:03.000
feel like vomiting - you see something horrid,
you just feel like vomiting. You become so

00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:07.950
sensitive you can't imagine, to virtue and
to goodness.

00:40:07.950 --> 00:40:14.680
Automatically it happens to you, I don't have
to tell you. I've seen people have changed

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:21.680
overnight. The whole idea is that the light
has to be brought in for you to see for yourself,

00:40:21.690 --> 00:40:27.769
and when it happens you'll be amazed, you
become such a different, wonderful person.

00:40:27.769 --> 00:40:34.769
There's everyone in America has Abraham Lincoln
within them, which has to be just awakened

00:40:35.269 --> 00:40:42.269
and you'll find that that great personality
can be shown in you, when it happens to you.

00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:50.430
It has to happen to all of you to feel that
greatness that lies hidden within.

00:40:50.869 --> 00:40:56.210
I cannot elaborately tell you about Vishuddhi
Chakra what they call the Krishna consciousness,

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:02.450
but not this Krishna consciousness which has
made people actual beggars, they are begging

00:41:02.450 --> 00:41:07.700
on the streets. You go in India in the villages,
about they were going to beat these people.

00:41:07.700 --> 00:41:11.749
They thought they are Krishna consciousness,
they wouldn’t get places in the hotels because

00:41:11.749 --> 00:41:15.670
they thought they are Krishna consciousness,
because these people were lost, they had no

00:41:15.670 --> 00:41:21.269
money left with them. Now they are begging
in India, imagine. How can we afford to have

00:41:21.269 --> 00:41:25.279
these beggars there? They have no money with
them, they can not come back, they don't know

00:41:25.279 --> 00:41:32.279
what to do with them, so many you will find
in the villages just begging. So this kind

00:41:32.999 --> 00:41:39.999
of thing that - imagine a person who is being
blessed by Shri Krishna Who is the Deity on

00:41:43.369 --> 00:41:45.829
this center, should beg!

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:52.069
He's the One Who is the giver of complete
wealth, why should we beg? This is the thing

00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:58.009
they don't understand, just the opposite of
what they are suppose to be. There are lots

00:41:58.009 --> 00:42:04.430
of stories of Krishna how He blessed people
with wealth. It is to be seen sometimes, if

00:42:04.430 --> 00:42:09.579
you have time, I may have time then we might
be able to see all those beautiful things

00:42:09.579 --> 00:42:12.259
that He did.

00:42:12.259 --> 00:42:19.259
So the other chakra is important, is the Chakra
of Christ. This center is very important because

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:25.680
this is the gate through this you have to
pass to your destination which is the limbic

00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:31.240
area. So Christ is the gate, many people are
shouting, “it's only He can save.” Where

00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:37.369
is He now? Is He here? When He was living,
they talked of Ibrahim, when He came then

00:42:37.369 --> 00:42:42.640
they said, “You are not the One. It was
Moses. You are not the One.”

00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:48.150
They denied Him, defied Him. Now when He's
dead, then we think, “It is Christ.” Now

00:42:48.150 --> 00:42:54.160
I have come, He's talked about Me, if you
read Bible you'll find He’s talked about

00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.210
Me very clearly there and I have to do My
job and I have come. You are going to say

00:42:59.210 --> 00:43:05.160
that it was Christ Who has to do it. If Christ
could do it, why did He say that “I'm going

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.809
to send you a comforter”? He talked of future,
didn’t He? Why did He say such a thing?

00:43:09.809 --> 00:43:14.259
We should find out why did He say that “I
will send you the Holy Ghost and the Comforter

00:43:14.259 --> 00:43:19.259
and the Redeemer and a Counselor”? Why did
He say that? Why not look forward to that?

00:43:19.259 --> 00:43:24.700
Because we are today after Christ. People
don't want to see this point, they want to

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:29.299
depend on Christ because He's in their pocket,
they can use Him the way they like.

00:43:29.299 --> 00:43:36.299
When He has talked, He has said, “Why not
see the point?” If this is what Christ is,

00:43:38.990 --> 00:43:45.509
then it is such a bad thing because people
say, “Christ was no good.” They say, “What

00:43:45.509 --> 00:43:51.470
has Christ given us?” Christians nations,
what have they done, what have they achieved?

00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:58.470
It's a bad name to Him if you do not see completion
of His work. I'm here to complete His work

00:43:59.819 --> 00:44:05.759
and when you do not complete His work, His
half-work done in a very half-way will bring

00:44:05.759 --> 00:44:06.900
bad name to Him.

00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:12.130
Why not people who claim about Christ understand
that what others have to say about it? If

00:44:12.130 --> 00:44:15.960
you want to know about Christians, go and
ask the Jews; and if you want to know about

00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:20.819
the Jews, go and ask the Muslims; and if you
want to know about the Muslims, go and ask

00:44:20.819 --> 00:44:27.819
the Hindus. There are all in a doldrum. Nobody
has any understanding that they are worshiping

00:44:28.099 --> 00:44:35.099
or they are admiring or advocating a flower
which belongs to one tree of life. They have

00:44:35.950 --> 00:44:42.749
all plucked those flowers, “This is mine,
this is mine, in my pocket,” and fighting.

00:44:42.749 --> 00:44:49.749
If religion means fighting and quarreling,
it is not a religion at all. If it is integration,

00:44:50.569 --> 00:44:52.869
then it is a religion.

00:44:52.869 --> 00:44:59.190
In Sahaja Yoga you'll find that they are all
together. Christ has said, very clearly, “Those

00:44:59.190 --> 00:45:06.190
who are not against Me are with Me.” Who
are those people? Try to find out. For that

00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:13.130
you have to little bit go out of Bible. In
the Bible how much do you have Christ there,

00:45:13.130 --> 00:45:18.529
for three years? Nobody allowed Him to live
for three years, and if they could, they would

00:45:18.529 --> 00:45:20.059
also kill Me.

00:45:20.059 --> 00:45:26.170
Not easy, He wanted to play the drama, otherwise
He would have finished all of them, in no

00:45:26.170 --> 00:45:33.170
time. So He has said that “You are to be
resurrected first, and then that's how you

00:45:33.599 --> 00:45:34.369
will be judged.”

00:45:34.369 --> 00:45:40.970
And the Day of Judgment is today, this is
the Day of Judgment, that's why you are confused,

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:44.819
this is the Day of Judgment where you will
be judged and how are you going to be judged?

00:45:44.819 --> 00:45:51.730
Through your Kundalini. Your Kundalini is
going to be awakened and you'll be judged

00:45:51.730 --> 00:45:55.440
where you are. That's what it is, and those
who will be calling Me, “Christ, Christ”

00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:02.380
I will not look at them, that's what it is.
By calling Him “Christ, Christ” you do

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:09.329
not become Christians, you have to get your
Realization, your baptism in the actual sense.

00:46:09.329 --> 00:46:14.259
It has to be an actualization. I'm telling
you that if you miss the point, you have missed

00:46:14.259 --> 00:46:21.259
it for ever and ever. Be careful on that point.
It's very important. Don't run after things

00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:29.420
which have no meaning to your consciousness.
Try to raise yourself up to this point and

00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:35.569
understand that the time has come for you
to transform, this is the time of your judgment

00:46:35.569 --> 00:46:41.910
and you have to get to it in a very big way.
The shallow things and all this will be finished.

00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:48.900
What is America or what is any country in
the eyes of God? Nothing. If they do not take

00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:55.900
to His ways, all will be treated like waste,
thoroughly waste, it's a wasteland. But if

00:46:56.059 --> 00:47:03.059
you rise, thousands and thousands and millions
and millions can be saved. Try to rise, try

00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:09.430
to understand your own responsibilities, that
is very important.

00:47:09.430 --> 00:47:16.430
Today is the last day and the last center
which is the Sahasrara, is the integration,

00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:23.470
integration of your being, of physical, mental,
emotional being, it takes place. Is integration

00:47:24.809 --> 00:47:31.009
of all the Deities, of all the Prophets, all
the great works that they have done, integration

00:47:31.009 --> 00:47:38.009
of all the scriptures, everything takes places
when this Sahasrara is opened out, when you

00:47:38.099 --> 00:47:39.759
become the Spirit.

00:47:39.759 --> 00:47:44.829
This is a much more difficult job, I know,
because if you don't have to transform people

00:47:44.829 --> 00:47:51.410
it is very easy to talk about it and get away.
But I have to transform, not only transform

00:47:51.410 --> 00:47:58.410
but you have to become, you cannot become
a Sahaji Yogi by paying Me, by saying things,

00:47:58.829 --> 00:48:04.180
by arguing, by showing up, you can only become
Sahaji Yogi by going within yourself, face

00:48:04.180 --> 00:48:11.180
up to it, see for yourself. I am here to help
you in every way possible. Whatever is possible

00:48:13.489 --> 00:48:17.789
we'll try to do it, but you all should also
understand your responsibility.

00:48:17.789 --> 00:48:24.720
It is not a joke now, it’s no more a joke.
It's not like Sunday morning you get up and

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:30.460
go to church, or Monday morning you go somewhere
else in the temple, and Tuesday morning you

00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:37.460
go to see Siddhivinayaka [Temple of Shri Ganesha
- SG] and another day you go to a mosque.

00:48:37.569 --> 00:48:41.999
It is not like that. It is a very serious
thing which we must understand. We are at

00:48:41.999 --> 00:48:48.400
the brink of destruction, be careful about
it. We must do things so that the blessings

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:54.079
of God comes to upon us and that we are saved.
It is a very serious thing, and the responsibility

00:48:54.079 --> 00:49:01.079
is much more on all the people who are getting
Realization, so do not treat it lightly. You

00:49:02.269 --> 00:49:04.499
all, I hope, will take it seriously.

00:49:04.499 --> 00:49:11.499
Thank God there is a nice seminar we are having
after this for three days, you can come down

00:49:11.940 --> 00:49:17.150
there, they have charged you very little,
we don't have to make any profit of out you,

00:49:17.150 --> 00:49:22.230
the only profit I can make is that you get
your profits, that's all. So please take it

00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:27.999
up seriously, work it out seriously, and I
tell you, out of you will come out those people

00:49:27.999 --> 00:49:34.730
who will build that foundations of that construction
which is going to come. Please don't waste

00:49:34.730 --> 00:49:38.140
your time in useless things, get to it.

00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:45.140
Any one of you can do it. I bless you with
My whole heart and know that I love you very

00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:50.380
much. If you have any problems, you can write
to Me, but don't write to Me about your family

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:54.450
problems and this and that, it's a headache
to Me, there is no need to write. Of course

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:58.589
I'm a mother, if you have problems you can
write but some people write ten pages saying,

00:49:58.589 --> 00:50:04.039
“my wife is fighting me.” It's bit too
much. You should write to Me about the problems

00:50:04.039 --> 00:50:10.029
which concern the whole country, concern the
whole world. Widen yourself and that’s how,

00:50:10.029 --> 00:50:16.559
though you may think that you are very unassuming
simple people, you are the ones who are going

00:50:16.559 --> 00:50:21.079
to be, not those who are successful, they
are blinded by their success; not those who

00:50:21.079 --> 00:50:25.710
are rich, they are not going to enter into
the Kingdom of God; not those who have a big

00:50:25.710 --> 00:50:32.710
name, no. It's you, you are going to enter
into the Kingdom

00:50:55.970 --> 00:51:02.970
of God.

00:51:06.299 --> 00:51:13.299
May God bless you.

00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:54.630
[Self Realization]

00:52:08.299 --> 00:52:15.299
Now, all the angels have a seat, now, put
your hands towards Me like this, and close

00:53:49.819 --> 00:53:54.309
your eyes, the vibrations are so much today,
nothing to do. Just so much vibrations tonight,

00:53:54.309 --> 00:54:01.309
it's tremendous. Just close your eyes, you'll
feel the cool breeze, most of you, close your

00:54:12.489 --> 00:54:16.269
eyes please.

00:54:16.269 --> 00:54:23.269
You just put your right hand on the head and
see if there is a cool breeze coming out,

00:54:26.410 --> 00:54:30.890
little higher, on top of your head.

00:54:30.890 --> 00:54:37.890
Hmm, it’s there. Now put your right hand
towards Me and put the left hand and see,

00:54:39.769 --> 00:54:46.769
little higher, about six inches higher, six
inches higher, change over, again, now put

00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:11.680
your hands up like this absolutely, close
the eyes and ask, “Is this the breeze of

00:55:16.460 --> 00:55:23.460
the Holy Ghost” or ask the question “Mother,
are You the Holy Ghost?

00:55:34.450 --> 00:55:41.450
You feel the cool breeze? Good, it's tremendous
today. May God bless you all.

00:55:51.690 --> 00:55:58.690
Those who have not felt any cool breeze, please
raise your hands. One, two and three. Are

00:56:00.950 --> 00:56:07.950
keeping all right? You are not well? All right,
doesn't matter, if you are not well maybe

00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:21.829
you may not feel today but you'll get well
and then you'll feel it, so it doesn't matter.

00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:27.150
There's one or two persons who have not felt
it, it’s so tremendous today, May God bless

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:28.130
you.

00:56:28.130 --> 00:56:35.130
You may give your addresses to these people,
let them know where you are, also you can

00:56:37.140 --> 00:56:42.509
take address for the seminar, if you want
to come, they are going to arrange a transport

00:56:42.509 --> 00:56:48.160
for you to go to Santa Cruz. Thank you very
much.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:55.160
I say goodbye to you, after a year I’ll
definitely will come to Los Angeles again,

00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:59.930
those who haven't cool breeze should keep
their hands raised. These boys will come and

00:56:59.930 --> 00:57:05.170
see you. All right, those people who haven't
got it, please keep your hands slightly raised

00:57:05.170 --> 00:57:12.170
so some people will come and see you, little
higher so that they'll come and see you. Here

00:57:17.749 --> 00:57:18.339
just have a look.

00:57:18.339 --> 00:57:21.380
Man in the Audience: I didn’t hear Your
last question. I didn’t understand what

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:21.630
You asked about the Holy Ghost.

00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:28.380
Shri Mataji: Just to know that I am the Holy
Ghost.

00:57:30.049 --> 00:57:34.799
Man in the Audience: You are Holy Ghost?

00:57:34.799 --> 00:57:36.950
Shri Mataji: Yes. Otherwise how will you recognize?

00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:42.749
Man in the Audience: The Bible says that God
is the Holy Ghost.

00:57:42.749 --> 00:57:46.989
Shri Mataji: Bible never says that. You don’t
understand that. You don’t teach Me Bible.

00:57:46.989 --> 00:57:53.989
[Man keeps interrupting Shri Mataji] It doesn’t
say. You don’t tell Me. You have no knowledge.

00:58:25.539 --> 00:58:32.539
Don’t disturb others. If you are such a
good person you ...
