1
00:00:01,130 --> 00:00:03,880
Who are the new people today, for the first
time?

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:04,880
You?

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:11,070
I am sorry I had to say all these things because
today was the meeting of the Sahaja Yogis

4
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,519
in the beginning.

5
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:18,929
And we are all going to enter into the same
Realm and it will be handy for you to know

6
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:28,720
what is expected of Sahaja Yogis, and with
that expectation I request you not to pay

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,200
attention to what I have said, much.

8
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,310
You should not be frightened.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,470
It’s not that frightening.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,390
You’ll like it later on very much!

11
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:41,000
What I have said it, you see.

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,190
So come forward.

13
00:00:42,190 --> 00:00:47,320
Those who have come for the first time, please
come forward.

14
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,620
You come for the first time?

15
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,620
All right.

16
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,620
Come forward!

17
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,500
Will be better idea.

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,579
No, no, here, on the chair.

19
00:00:55,579 --> 00:00:58,050
On the first row of chairs.

20
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:00,650
Will be a good idea.

21
00:01:00,650 --> 00:01:01,650
Yes.

22
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:03,810
Actually, it happens that your religion gets
enlightened.

23
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,810
You become that.

24
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:06,900
Then you can’t help it.

25
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,900
What to do?

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,420
I mean you don’t have to tell, “Don’t
do!

27
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,689
Don’t do!”

28
00:01:11,689 --> 00:01:13,579
It just happens.

29
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:16,740
You just can’t do it.

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:19,909
It’s so helpful, isn’t it?

31
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:23,069
You just can’t do it.

32
00:01:23,069 --> 00:01:26,859
You don’t feel like doing it!

33
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:29,700
Because if you are enjoying your Spirit you
don’t feel like doing nonsensical things.

34
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:33,130
It is better to get it and see for yourself
what happens.

35
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:34,130
All right?

36
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:36,729
That’s the best way to give it a full chance.

37
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:40,139
Those who have come for the first time do
come forward.

38
00:01:40,139 --> 00:01:41,749
You’ve come for the first time?

39
00:01:41,749 --> 00:01:42,749
Please come forward.

40
00:01:42,749 --> 00:01:43,749
No!

41
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:44,749
You are not for the first time!

42
00:01:44,749 --> 00:01:45,749
Let her come forward here.

43
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:47,880
You are all for the first time here?

44
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,880
No.

45
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,530
You can go one step backward, is a good idea.

46
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:56,950
You see, you can receive my vibrations even
from there where Kingsley is.

47
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,990
Isn’t it Kingsley?

48
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:02,380
Aren’t you receiving my vibrations?

49
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,380
Much more!

50
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,889
Yes that’s it.

51
00:02:04,889 --> 00:02:11,160
Now this is a system which is built within
us.

52
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:16,380
That’s why it is called as ‘Sahaja’.

53
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:21,410
This is what is the system within us that
exists.

54
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,590
‘Sahaja’ means ‘born with you’.

55
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,200
This is all born with you.

56
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,510
You have achieved it.

57
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,120
It’s all within you.

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,630
It’s a system that is built into this or
built into that.

59
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,200
In the same way it’s a system built into
you.

60
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,810
You are just ready.

61
00:02:37,810 --> 00:02:38,990
You are to be put to the mains.

62
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,780
That’s all is the job is.

63
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,580
For putting to the mains also there’s something
built into you.

64
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,480
If you see the triangular bone called as ‘sacrum’,
means ‘sacred bone’, this Kundalini is

65
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,480
there.

66
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,630
This is the one that gives you your rebirth.

67
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:01,740
By rebirth what happens [is] that your awareness,
which is human awareness, becomes enlightened

68
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,870
by your Spirit.

69
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,360
Your Spirit comes into your awareness.

70
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,540
So far your Spirit is not.

71
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:10,750
Your Spirit knows all about you.

72
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:13,650
It is in your heart.

73
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,952
But you do not know about It.

74
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:24,110
So what happens [is] this Spirit, which is
enjoying itself, enlightens your awareness

75
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:29,990
and you get a new awareness by which you start
feeling a cool breeze in your hand, a cool

76
00:03:29,990 --> 00:03:31,660
breeze in your hand.

77
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:36,780
And this cool breeze, for the first time,
on your central nervous system starts flowing.

78
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,650
So you feel it, actually you feel it.

79
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,910
Now the enlightenment takes place of all these
centres which are within you, which are there

80
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,290
because of our evolutionary process.

81
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:55,100
And these enlightened centres are on your
fingers.

82
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:59,540
They get enlightened too and you start feeling
them within you.

83
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,510
You start feeling your own centres and you
start feeling the centres of others.

84
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:10,090
Now this happening takes place within you
of the Kundalini awakening just to attract

85
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,160
your attention inside.

86
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,090
Because your attention is outside, you cannot
take it in.

87
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:17,039
You know many people think, “You put your
attention here, you put your attention there.

88
00:04:17,039 --> 00:04:18,060
” – it’s all wrong.

89
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:22,870
It has to be spontaneously attracted inside
and it’s done by this Kundalini, and Kundalini

90
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:28,010
is just like a germinating primule within
us, a seed.

91
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:32,370
It just rises spontaneously.

92
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:34,970
And when it rises it breaks through here.

93
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,560
And this is what is the real Baptism.

94
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,040
You really feel it here coming out.

95
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,540
You can feel the cool breeze coming out.

96
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,060
You can feel the cool breeze from your hands.

97
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:56,060
This is real Baptism that John the Baptist
wanted people to have, and that Christ talked

98
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,060
about.

99
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,800
All the religions have taught us to be in
the centre.

100
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,510
When they said, “Don’t do this, don’t
do that,” they did not want to condition

101
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:16,180
us but to tell us that how we are going to
be in the centre.

102
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:30,650
And when we are in the centre then what happens
to us [is] that you get the desire to know

103
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:32,400
your Spirit.

104
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,590
And this desire is fulfilled through the awakening
of the Kundalini.

105
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:44,710
Now the Sahaja Yoga at this stage is really
a Maha Yoga in the sense [that] it is the

106
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:48,350
Great Yoga because many people can get Realisation.

107
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,350
Thousands of people can get it because the
blossom time has come.

108
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:00,570
But even if they get Realisation, they are
to be looked after, they are to be nourished,

109
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:02,800
they are to be told about it.

110
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,400
Everything should be decoded.

111
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,100
You will be amazed – everything becomes
so logical.

112
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,050
Gradually you start understanding it.

113
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:13,750
Your complete freedom is established.

114
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,800
Nobody says that, “Don’t do this!”

115
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,930
Nothing is said.

116
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:22,340
But you just don’t do it – yourself!

117
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,340
I will not tell you as Moses had to tell,
poor thing.

118
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,350
He had to face all the mad people.

119
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:30,380
But no, after Realisation it just happens
and you just don’t do it.

120
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:31,380
You will not do it.

121
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,380
It just happens to you.

122
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,930
It is nothing to be told.

123
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:36,120
It just happens.

124
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,610
It works out.

125
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,940
This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

126
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,150
In the beginning you have to be really ardent
Sahaja Yogis.

127
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,150
In the beginning you have to be.

128
00:06:46,150 --> 00:06:49,280
It’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga still
in England, I would say.

129
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,060
Really ardently attached to it by which you
develop yourself very well and develop this

130
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:57,050
tree of Sahaja Yoga in your own country.

131
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:59,310
Because you have to save so many.

132
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,169
The Last Judgment has started.

133
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:02,169
It’s started.

134
00:07:02,169 --> 00:07:05,070
Through Kundalini awakening only you judge
yourself.

135
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:07,970
You know what are the centres you are catching,
what are your problems.

136
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,030
You know what are the centres others are catching.

137
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:11,030
You judge yourself.

138
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,070
Supposing a person comes and tell me, “Mother,
my Agnya is very bad.

139
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,240
” Do you know what it means?

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,909
That, “My ego has developed.

141
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:21,270
” But [if] you tell somebody, “You have
got an ego.

142
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,410
” – you will have a punch on your head!

143
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:28,690
But the person himself comes and says, “Mother,
I see my ego.

144
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:30,110
” You start seeing yourself.

145
00:07:30,110 --> 00:07:34,419
You start seeing your problems, because you
are out of it.

146
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:37,669
And then you can cure it also and make it
better.

147
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:42,590
You improve it and you are better.

148
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:46,100
You judge yourself and you judge yourself
with love and understanding.

149
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:47,870
You don’t hate yourself by that.

150
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,870
It’s only you, yourself.

151
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:49,870
You are going to judge.

152
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:56,960
Within you is the power of God that judges
you, is the Spirit which tells you.

153
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,312
A rapport is established with the Spirit.

154
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:03,580
The Spirit itself will tell you, “This is
the mistake, this is the problem.

155
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,930
” We don’t need anybody to tell us.

156
00:08:04,930 --> 00:08:07,560
It’s only you who will know.

157
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:10,630
It’s only you who will judge yourself.

158
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:12,350
It’s only you who will grow yourself.

159
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,040
It’s your own freedom.

160
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,490
It’s your own Self.

161
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:20,790
Your entire personality changes, entire personality
changes.

162
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:26,110
I have never told anybody not to take drugs
as such, except for one or two people who

163
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:27,400
were still carrying on.

164
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,699
But also very mildly.

165
00:08:28,699 --> 00:08:31,940
And I told them how to get rid of it.

166
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:35,130
But you just don’t want to take them, just
don’t like it.

167
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:39,940
You find it very filthy.

168
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,130
You feel like vomiting.

169
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,146
Just like that, the religion is enlightened
in your stomach.

170
00:08:44,146 --> 00:08:46,380
That the time has come now for you to do it.

171
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,930
That was the time when it was not so [then]
they taught you how to do it.

172
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:51,310
But today the time has come, it can work out.

173
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:54,209
You are all just there.

174
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:58,670
The completion of the whole creation has to
come this way.

175
00:08:58,670 --> 00:09:01,200
It has to work out.

176
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,790
But you cannot reason it out.

177
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:07,670
But once you get it – because it’s beyond
reason, it happens beyond reason; the Kundalini

178
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,110
awakens not by reason, spontaneously, by master
only – once it happens then the whole thing

179
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:15,210
becomes logical.

180
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:17,660
You see, there’s a microscope, then you
can see through it.

181
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,310
But if there is not a microscope, you cannot
understand.

182
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:25,180
The ‘microscope’ is your Spirit.

183
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,110
It’s very simple.

184
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:32,100
Now, I do not want to go into details about
it.

185
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,800
I think these people have been given…

186
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,370
Gavin have you given them the papers and things?

187
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:43,870
Let them see for themselves.

188
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:48,880
Have you all got the papers?

189
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,440
Have you got?

190
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,440
No?

191
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,520
Let her have.

192
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:54,600
Let this lady have.

193
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,660
You sit a little erect, all right?

194
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,670
Straight, sit little straight.

195
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,680
All right.

196
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:04,600
You have to sit a little erect, not much,
but a little erect.

197
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,860
Not slouchy.

198
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,790
Neither like this.

199
00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,240
Just sit straight.

200
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,970
Put your hands like this, all of you.

201
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:15,830
Just put your hands.

202
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,680
Now close your eyes.

203
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:25,830
Put your feet like this, little straight,
on the ground.

204
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:37,700
Not pressing much but they should be on the
ground properly.

205
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,130
Come in!

206
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,370
Come!

207
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:46,600
There are three, four seats.

208
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:50,330
Here, in front.

209
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,580
Yes.

210
00:10:51,580 --> 00:11:04,529
After Realisation you have to go very fast
and try to understand it, otherwise you may

211
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:05,810
lose your vibrations.

212
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:06,810
That happens with some people.

213
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,810
So be careful!

214
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,860
It’s a very, very delicate thing; it’s
very subtle.

215
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:17,589
And because we are gross – suddenly we become
subtle – if we do not catch up to it, we

216
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:18,589
lose it also.

217
00:11:18,589 --> 00:11:24,950
So for one month after Realisation you have
to be very, very careful and get hold of another

218
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,150
Sahaja Yogis here and we also have an ashram
here.

219
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,330
We have to work it out.

220
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:33,310
Close your eyes.

221
00:11:33,310 --> 00:11:37,279
Just close your eyes.

222
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,950
It just works.

223
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,110
Just close your eyes.

224
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:42,660
Don’t think about it.

225
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,660
Don’t think.

226
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:44,773
It will work out without thinking.

227
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:47,170
Put both the hands towards me, please.

228
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:52,010
Both the hands like this.

229
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:56,470
One of the centres that is catching in most
of you is that you all feel guilty for nothing

230
00:11:56,470 --> 00:11:59,540
at all, for nothing at all.

231
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:02,120
It’s a fashion to feel guilty.

232
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:05,990
So everybody starts feeling guilty for nothing
at all.

233
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,890
Or maybe we confess and this and that.

234
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:13,240
Now I have to tell you that not to feel guilty
at all.

235
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,370
Say that, “I am not guilty.

236
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,370
”

237
00:12:16,370 --> 00:12:18,339
Thrice you say, “Mother, I am not guilty.

238
00:12:18,339 --> 00:12:19,339
”

239
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:25,830
This is also a myth that you feel guilty.

240
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:41,710
That will help you a lot.

241
00:12:41,710 --> 00:12:57,709
Once you get your Realisation you have to
also have the spiritual education to know

242
00:12:57,709 --> 00:13:01,680
how to handle this, how to handle this power.

243
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:21,830
You are getting it because this is your own
right, but you must know what 

244
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,830
you are getting.

245
00:13:22,830 --> 00:13:26,770
They’ve got it, all of them.

246
00:13:26,770 --> 00:13:35,910
All the Sahaja Yogis should receive vibrations
and expose completely with their heart, absolutely.

247
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:38,920
Just put it.

248
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:41,930
Be meditative today.

249
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,860
And you have to promise in your heart.

250
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:53,380
You have to be much more active and ardent
about Sahaja Yoga if you have to save your

251
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:57,649
brothers and sisters.

252
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,060
Only your heart can be binding, nothing else.

253
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,060
Nothing else.

254
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,320
It’s only your heart.

255
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:14,440
As you are attached to someone you love, you
should be attached to your Spirit.

256
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,649
Spirit you should love the most.

257
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:20,640
Nobody is more important than your Spirit.

258
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,500
Are you feeling any cool breeze in the hands?

259
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,500
Not yet?

260
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,500
Close your eyes.

261
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,500
Have patience with yourself.

262
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,100
One has to have patience.

263
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:29,190
Close your eyes.

264
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,190
Have patience!

265
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,190
Just don’t think.

266
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,110
It will work out.

267
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,900
Have patience with yourself!

268
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:41,149
You put both the hands towards me, not meeting
each other but towards me, separate.

269
00:14:41,149 --> 00:14:45,800
Put both the hands separately, not towards
each other but towards me.

270
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,850
Please put them towards me.

271
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:48,850
Yes.

272
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,970
Close your eyes.

273
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:53,310
Close your eyes.

274
00:14:53,310 --> 00:14:54,310
And just leave it.

275
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,390
Don’t think about it.

276
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,100
Don’t worry about it.

277
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,380
It will work.

278
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:02,980
It’s like just a flower becoming a fruit
– spontaneously.

279
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:08,110
Just close your eyes and put your hands towards
me.

280
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:14,590
Put your attention to your heart.

281
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,520
Catch the joy part of it.

282
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,520
Just heart.

283
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:20,850
Just put your both the hands towards me only
and just pay attention to your heart.

284
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,890
It will work out.

285
00:15:23,890 --> 00:15:28,440
Are you feeling cool breeze?

286
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,160
It’s good, great.

287
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,889
Just enjoy it.

288
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,709
Just enjoy.

289
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:38,741
Do not pay attention in one particular direction.

290
00:15:38,741 --> 00:15:40,230
Just leave it free.

291
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:45,709
Just leave it free.

292
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:48,170
Do not fix your attention anywhere.

293
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:55,079
Just leave it free.

294
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:56,079
It will work out.

295
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,079
Gavin, organise for these people behind.

296
00:15:57,079 --> 00:15:59,940
Ask people to slowly come along.

297
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:04,320
Keep your eyes shut.

298
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,360
All new people please keep your eyes shut.

299
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:11,389
They are going to check you.

300
00:16:11,389 --> 00:16:20,250
One by one, yes move on.

301
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:24,680
Jill, come forward.

302
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:32,070
Start moving in the centre.

303
00:16:32,070 --> 00:16:33,550
Yes.

304
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,019
Good.

305
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:44,589
Those Sahaja Yogis who want to get themselves
also checked up, ask other Sahaja Yogis to

306
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:48,350
do it.

307
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:59,880
Magda, I think these three people are for
the first time or what?

308
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,850
Just see them, their vibrations.

309
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:09,110
They haven’t felt it yet.

310
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:14,010
Can you move a little coming up here.

311
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:15,220
Marcus?

312
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,059
Or who is there?

313
00:17:20,059 --> 00:17:23,780
Those who want to be checked.

314
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:28,950
Also ask others to be checked.

315
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:33,260
Douglas, go and check Dinesh.

316
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:38,150
All of you must get checking!

317
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:40,260
Those of you who want checking should raise
your hands.

318
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:45,000
Ask people to check you.

319
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,059
Check her.

320
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:50,860
Vishuddhi, Left Vishuddhis are horrible.

321
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:56,620
I don’t know what to say.

322
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,250
Hester [Spiro], you ask somebody to check
you also.

323
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,520
Peter [Pearce], you sit down.

324
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,360
David [Spiro] you sit down!

325
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
Get yourself checked!

326
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:06,000
Linda [Pearce], Peter, all of you.

327
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Please.

328
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,000
Because I am going away.

329
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,679
Let everybody be checked – better is.

330
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:11,679
Marcus?

331
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,410
You be checked also.

332
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:23,169
Better to get it done once for all.

333
00:18:23,169 --> 00:18:27,900
Get them checked.

334
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:34,210
Who can check her?

335
00:18:34,210 --> 00:18:37,370
Ray [Harris]?

336
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:42,100
Where is he?

337
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:48,410
Go and check Hester.

338
00:18:48,410 --> 00:18:53,150
He’s got it?

339
00:18:53,150 --> 00:18:57,140
Kingsley you check Hester, it’s better.

340
00:18:57,140 --> 00:19:03,780
He (Ray) is a Jew (also) so it would be better!

341
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,750
(laughing) Somebody else should do it it’s
better.

342
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,930
May God bless you!

343
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:16,040
But everybody gets checked it’s better!

344
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,770
John, you sit down.

345
00:19:18,770 --> 00:19:21,510
You get yourself checked.

346
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:22,880
Sit down.

347
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,880
Marcus?

348
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,610
Is he checked?

349
00:19:25,610 --> 00:19:27,669
How are they?

350
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:36,510
Now those who are checking should get themselves
checked also, is a better idea.

351
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,910
There should be nothing.

352
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:45,990
‘Prana’ – say the mantra for him.

353
00:19:45,990 --> 00:19:51,360
For her, Malcolm [Murdoch], ‘Prana’ is
the mantra for her.

354
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,360
Haa!

355
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,360
Done.

356
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:54,810
Just broken through.

357
00:19:54,810 --> 00:19:55,810
Haaa!

358
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:04,980
Now this is to be judged a little by yourself.

359
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,750
You should know.

360
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:15,559
These are the small things that one should
know.

361
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,549
This gentleman?

362
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:23,530
Why don’t you see this gentleman?

363
00:20:23,530 --> 00:20:27,520
Can you check John.

364
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:37,429
John, put your left hand towards me and right
hand outside.

365
00:20:37,429 --> 00:20:39,830
Felicity [Payment].

366
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:45,850
Somebody should check Felicity also.

367
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:49,800
Brighton people should again get themselves
rechecked afterwards.

368
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,160
Everybody should get themselves rechecked.

369
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,070
Somehow or other get yourself cleared out.

370
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:56,429
Every one of you.

371
00:20:56,429 --> 00:20:58,730
Gavin you also get yourself checked.

372
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:00,140
Everybody should get yourself checked.

373
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,049
That’s the best way.

374
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:08,330
And we should be thankful to people for checking
us and giving us vibrations.

375
00:21:08,330 --> 00:21:11,549
Instead of getting angry and upset.

376
00:21:11,549 --> 00:21:14,419
How are the children?

377
00:21:14,419 --> 00:21:17,289
Jane [Brown] bring her.

378
00:21:17,289 --> 00:21:19,440
Is she alright?

379
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:21,590
Bring her here.

380
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,380
How is it?

381
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:42,070
Let everybody check today 

382
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:53,450
and give bandhans.

383
00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:03,730
What about this gentleman?

384
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:13,890
He’s got it?

385
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:27,750
He’s Ray’s father, he should get it.

386
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:45,309
Tell him not to feel guilty about anything!

387
00:22:45,309 --> 00:22:55,020
You are facing Mother who loves you!

388
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:04,340
Just say, “Mother I am not guilty.

389
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,340
”

390
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:08,299
Just say that.

391
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:17,740
What guilt can you people have?

392
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,320
Jill?

393
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,900
Coming?

394
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,490
Haaa!

395
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:25,650
Alright Jill?

396
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:30,400
It’s come up.

397
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:35,150
How is she?

398
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:38,309
Don’t talk.

399
00:23:38,309 --> 00:23:46,830
Just raise the Kundalini.

400
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:58,130
Just raise the Kundalini.

401
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:02,290
You give him a bandhan.

402
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:05,950
Chaya, tumse karab dekho.

403
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:15,790
Regis, you also get yourself checked and others
should check and you check others.

404
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,380
Every one of you.

405
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:22,920
John, please put yourself into a bandhan.

406
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:25,520
Now check other people.

407
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,820
Come along.

408
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,740
Those who have been checking sit down and
those who have to be checked.

409
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,960
You’ve done it?

410
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,179
Have you done?

411
00:24:35,179 --> 00:24:37,400
You’ve got it?

412
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:39,750
Have you felt anything?

413
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,660
Did you feel any cool breeze?

414
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,660
Good, great.

415
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,660
Now close your eyes.

416
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:44,660
Enjoy your Self.

417
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,750
Now don’t stop at that!

418
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:48,750
What do you say Malcolm?

419
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,790
Better?

420
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:53,970
What about this child?
