00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:18.000
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.160
First of all

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.300
We have to know what is the truth.

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.460
People are seeking, seeking, seeking, seeking all over.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:39.000
But they don't know what they are seeking and what should they get after their seeking.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:55.000
This seeking can lead you into many diverse directions. Some of them could be very very dangerous and absolutely misleading.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:03.360
And many must have or also felt that. I'm sure there are many who have found it out.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:12.000
But they think there is no way they can return.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.100
The seeking is very simple to understand.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.800
That you want to know yourself.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:24.580
All the time we say : i want this, i like this, i this, i that.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.700
But who is this I? What is it?

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.760
Who is this one myself?

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:38.700
What am i? Do i know anything about myself?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.680
It's very superficial knowledge we have about ourselves.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.060
Everybody have said, all the religions have said : you should  know yourself.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.740
There is no difference on this one. Actually in all religions, if you're go into essence, there is no difference.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:03.680
According to time it was little bit stressed on one point and sometimes on another point.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.220
But the fundamental thing is that you have to know yourself.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.740
How do you know yourself is the point.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.020
People will say: do this, give up everything, give up your family,  give up everything.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:25.680
Wear, this kind of dress cut your hair or shave your head and all that nonsense.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.020
It's so outward.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.400
If you put a little bit of your intelligence you'll see it's all outward.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.720
It's so skin deep, it has no meaning.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.700
So what has to happen?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.440
We talk of a last breakthrough of the evolution.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.900
How do you achieve it?

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.400
When you are evolved up to the stage of human beings.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.180
We have to know one thing for definitely.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.160
That there's something missing within us.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.880
Otherwise world would have been a most beautiful place, the paradise to live in.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.420
But something's wrong with the human beings and what is that?

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.480
Is to understand how we have come through evolution.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.640
And as human beings there are so many things of the animal stage lingering within us.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:38.220
The way we talk, the way we try to oppress others, the way we talk to sort of dominate others.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:44.900
The way we want to snatch everything, the way we are only worried about our food.This, that.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:53.740
All this is not really a noble human beings sides.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:04:00.080
These are all lingering from that animal instinct. All right. We have to accept it.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.760
Because we are human beings so they are to be there.

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.840
Nothing so much frightening.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.600
But also we have one more thing that we think.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.460
And we think and think and think and think no end of ourselves sometimes.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:22.119
Sometimes we think we should protest for this.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.620
Sometimes we feel that we must become very violent

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.280
All these things are coming from our human mind.

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:38.280
Animals won't be violent for something just for violence sake. They'll be violent, alright.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:43.640
But for their own purpose of killing some animal or something.

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:49.300
But here we have groups and groups of people who just enjoy violence.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:57.720
This is another development in the human awareness, i think, that we enjoy  destruction of others.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.780
But also there is a seeking.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:09.880
This is the sign that people want their evolution, they want to evolve into a better personality.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.880
That they want to become

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.659
something

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.550
which is complete.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.540
How do you achieve it?

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:26.500
Now I must say that we have not achieved our evolution ourselves up to the human level.

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.560
So to achieve a higher

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.919
awareness

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:34.549
there must be some arrangement between us.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.549
And that is the arrangement we are not aware of.

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.829
And that arrangement is that within you is the power.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.860
It's your own power.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.710
To give you this

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:51.319
last breakthrough

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.549
Through the awakening of that power, already you have been told about it.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.620
It exists,  it's there.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:08.440
And It is the right of every human being to get his self-knowledge, self-realization.

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:12.520
Sahaja,  Saha means born with you.

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.440
With you is born the right.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.100
And why should we not ask our fundamental  rights

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:25.440
society that we should have our self-realization. Which is your own.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.460
It is there already placed within you. You don't have to do anything, of course you can't pay for it.

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:36.560
How much did you pay for your evolution so far?

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.610
And how can it be different from different people?

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:46.969
Because in every human being this power, which we call as Kundalini exists.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.820
Whether he is white, black, yellow, blue any color.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.480
Whether he belongs to north or south, anyplace.

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.840
Whether he belongs to this country or that country.

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:07.520
They all have this power universally placed it their Kundalini.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:09.940
Even if I say everybody has a heart.

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:14.300
So why should we have differentiation?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
But this mind.

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:23.360
This human mind creates this differentiation and this problems saying that of course they are not of our country.

00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:29.510
They don't belong to our group and like animals again we start getting into groups.

00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:32.210
Groups of

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:37.610
different, I don't know, denomination. Like some people have their

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:42.860
fork and spoon put this way, so they are one group.

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:49.699
Some people drink coffee, so they have a group like that, you see. We are very good at forming groups.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:56.390
This is also animal instinct, I think, that we try to form groups of such stupid things.

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:59.210
And then we can have wars.

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:05.840
Because we must fight. We are a group,something great, so we should fight others.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:10.969
All these instincts that are within us are inherited.

00:08:12.060 --> 00:08:14.929
They have come to us. They say it is in our genes.

00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.580
Still, can we change the genes?

00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:22.420
Can we

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.820
transform

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:27.830
Our personality into something higher and for that

00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:33.360
I tell you there is a power within us all of you have that power within you.

00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.080
And what does it give you?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:42.460
It  passes through six centers, as  told you, it nourishes it

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.640
it integrates it and

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:52.260
ultimately it pierces through the last fontanel bone area. We can call that actualisation or the baptism.

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.120
And is

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:59.200
connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.550
Again, I say love

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:05.170
divine compassion.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.170
And divine love.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.400
So you get connected to that power which is all-pervading?

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:19.530
If you ask a doctor who runs our heart, he'll say it's the autonomous nervous system.But what, who is the auto?

00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.660
Who does all these things?

00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.020
Who does all the living work?Look at this flowers,beautiful.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:30.480
Who has made these flowers such a different different flower?

00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:35.500
How does this mother Earth differentiates and how she gives all these flowers?

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.040
Do we think about it? We take it for granted.

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.820
All living work we take it for granted, but it is done by this divine power.

00:09:45.940 --> 00:09:48.300
Believe me. There is this divine power

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:54.400
around us which protects us, which looks after us, which guides us

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.020
and also

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:59.429
above all it loves us.

00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.460
And it cares for us.

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.520
It wants, that we should all receive

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.720
the blessings of this all-pervading power.

00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:17.549
But if you are not connected how can you? For example this instrument is not connected to the mains, it is useless.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:24.520
It won't work, so we all have to be connected with that all-pervading power.

00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:27.240
This is one thing if we understand.

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:34.960
You can also know, but you are quite capable of getting to it.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.450
There's no

00:10:37.450 --> 00:10:39.450
outer thing you have to do.

00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:46.589
Like giving up this, giving that or praying, or nothing of the kind it is there, this process.

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:51.059
Living process works, and you get your self-realization.

00:10:52.330 --> 00:10:55.080
Only thing is that if you have to enlighten,

00:10:55.839 --> 00:10:57.959
then you have to be enlightened.

00:10:58.630 --> 00:11:03.780
Like a candle which is not enlightened cannot enlighten any other candle, but one

00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:10.970
candle, which is enlightened, can enlighten so many candles, in the same way you get the power to

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:14.900
enlighten so many people all over the world and

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.199
not only that,  but you get so many powers.

00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:22.459
But the greatest power is that of compassion and love.

00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:25.440
By which you care,

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.440
by which you help people.

00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:35.560
Luckily now in your country itself they on the medical

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:40.040
institutions have accepted Sahaja yoga, that it works

00:11:40.830 --> 00:11:43.699
because it attacks or, we should say, it

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.990
nourishes

00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:47.880
the centers,

00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.880
basic centers in our body.

00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:57.080
Now these centers are responsible for our physical, mental, emotional and also the spiritual being and

00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:01.100
it enlightens it and with that enlightenment

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.600
you get definitely cured. It's a fact with Sahaja yoga, many people have been cured.

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:12.590
We also have a hospital in India and we are going to have another hospital there, may be in America also

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.280
we might have hospital, where you don't have to pay for it.

00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:25.460
Because it is your own power, you may pay for your food or something, but for treatment. What can you pay when it's your own?

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:31.920
And this is what is going to tell people how

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:35.060
powerful you are.

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:42.410
Otherwise some are extremely aggressive and some are actually extremely depressive. There's nothing in between.

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:45.859
But with this power you become so

00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.500
much full of compassion.

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:51.710
Then your attention goes from you to others.

00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:57.829
What you can do for others? How can you give them realization and suddenly  you discover

00:12:58.980 --> 00:13:04.189
that around you is so many destructive forces, so many disturbing forces,

00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:07.790
so many problems, suddenly you find the discipline.

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:16.820
If you can transform human being, but it's no question of transformation. I would say it is the question of evolutionary

00:13:17.459 --> 00:13:22.669
processes and when this takes place you find you are transformed completely.

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:25.490
And thousands have to be transformed.

00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:29.389
Thousands and thousands and millions and millions, but somehow

00:13:30.329 --> 00:13:32.329
America has a different type of approach

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.319
to

00:13:34.319 --> 00:13:35.939
spirituality.

00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.920
They think, if I don't take money then something wrong with me.

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.600
I must accept money .

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:46.040
They have told me so many things, some experts came and told me.

00:13:46.649 --> 00:13:49.849
Explained to me all the economics and all that, which I don't understand.

00:13:50.850 --> 00:13:53.749
And they think, that it should be saleable.

00:13:55.499 --> 00:14:00.799
Can't understand  this  kind of a thing, how much will you pay first Christ?

00:14:02.339 --> 00:14:04.339
How much will you pay for any

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:06.920
saintly personality?

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:08.189
Because

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:09.720
It is

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:14.300
this value can not be charged.It's invalueable.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.020
Something that's the most invaluable for you

00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:19.580
Is to know yourself.

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:28.780
if you have not known yourself, you're still going round and round and round in the mad rush of thinking.

00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:34.680
Even Einstein, you'll be surprised, has talked about it, that he was trying to find

00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:38.448
the theory of relativity

00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:41.540
and just he couldn't find it.

00:14:41.879 --> 00:14:48.769
So he went into his garden and was playing with soap bubbles and suddenly from somewhere unknown, that's what he says,

00:14:49.769 --> 00:14:51.629
the theory of relativity

00:14:51.629 --> 00:14:56.029
dawned upon him and he called that unknown area

00:14:56.999 --> 00:15:04.369
he calls them by a name and that name is rather to me not so precise.

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:07.100
But he says there is an area

00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:12.019
Which you can exploit, by which you can

00:15:12.689 --> 00:15:13.860
understand

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.809
for the future

00:15:15.809 --> 00:15:23.689
generation, for the future scientist, where you get the ideas from there, and he said for that you must have

00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.329
a kind of a personality, that can perceive

00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:34.009
that torsion area, from where the ideas are coming.

00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:39.229
If you can enter into the that area,  you can get

00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:42.349
the full idea as to

00:15:43.019 --> 00:15:45.019
what is reality.

00:15:47.819 --> 00:15:49.938
He calls it cognitive, he says

00:15:49.939 --> 00:15:54.529
this is a cognitive science and such a person can tell you so many things

00:15:54.839 --> 00:15:58.758
which will you put it to the scientific test, you'll find it's

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:05.688
absolutely correct. And this is what happened to him because himself was a realized soul and

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:09.649
many people like Newton himself was a realized soul.

00:16:10.499 --> 00:16:18.199
Abraham Lincoln was a realized soul, but they could not tell about it to others ,because nobody would believe and

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:25.100
anybody trying to tell anything they just used to torture them. Every saint, real saint

00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:29.120
I mean, has been tortured,  every sufi has been tortured.

00:16:30.540 --> 00:16:35.100
In our country especially many saints have been very badly treated.

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.320
Also in other countries. Why?

00:16:38.490 --> 00:16:45.919
Because they are only one and maybe people were jealous, that how could they know so much, how could they talk about so many things?

00:16:48.029 --> 00:16:55.249
Now with all this, now only think if I have done anything is very simple that I thought no use

00:16:55.949 --> 00:17:01.938
giving this realization to one or two person , which was a tradition to give to only one to one.

00:17:02.850 --> 00:17:05.809
But now I felt it won't work out.

00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.780
We have to have it for the masses.

00:17:09.299 --> 00:17:16.579
And I just what I did was to find out a method  by which I can give a mass realization.

00:17:17.039 --> 00:17:23.148
That's all, which is a simple thing and that is working and it worked very well.

00:17:23.429 --> 00:17:25.429
As I said, in America

00:17:26.039 --> 00:17:31.759
they just think of this another achievement of human beings, that they know about money.

00:17:32.840 --> 00:17:39.020
So money, money, money, everything money, so they can't understand even spirituality without money.

00:17:39.340 --> 00:17:41.860
But in a place like, we can say, Russia.

00:17:43.070 --> 00:17:50.229
Russia people, Russian people had no freedom as you have and they had oppression

00:17:50.870 --> 00:17:53.469
from all sides in there.

00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:56.300
As you know the

00:17:56.300 --> 00:17:58.629
whole thing was a

00:17:59.420 --> 00:18:04.629
communistic country and in that communism they were completely oppressed.

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:06.980
So as a result

00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:10.900
they went inside themselves and tried to find out

00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.070
solutions inside.

00:18:13.070 --> 00:18:15.070
So when they saw me.

00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:17.140
Just seeing me,  I don't know how

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:24.490
thousands of them came now we have thousands and thousands and thousands of people in Russia alone.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:28.220
Also in other some countries, I mean,

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.800
I mean I see here,

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.880
I'm just thinking in Russia we have to take

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:38.760
they cannot put it in a hall. We have to have a big tent or

00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:47.320
olympics where they had some sort of a thing like that. So the trouble is we should give up this idea

00:18:48.590 --> 00:18:53.229
that I can find it for myself. This is very very common, you cannot.

00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:57.280
This is the only evolution in which you

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:00.849
have to get it from an enlightened person.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:03.820
You have to humble on this point that

00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:08.829
I can't get it on my own, I can find my own,way you cannot

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:13.750
you'll be lost. You have to have somebody, who is already enlightened.

00:19:14.320 --> 00:19:18.260
Now how to get an enlightened person also. How to?

00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:25.000
Because after realization you know the absolute truth on your fingertips you can feel

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000
the centers of other person.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:31.569
If something is fishy, you can feel it.

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:36.399
If somebody is cheating, you can feel it ,everything ,your fingers speak.

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:44.200
This is what Muhammad Sahib has said:  At the time of resurrection your hands will speak. Clearly, how can hand speak?

00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:50.139
This is how. Because all these five fingers are the centers, sixth and seventh center.

00:19:51.029 --> 00:19:54.228
One on the physical side another on the

00:19:56.249 --> 00:19:59.598
physical and also mental side was the right side and

00:20:01.139 --> 00:20:04.309
emotional side on the left side. These are two different

00:20:07.889 --> 00:20:13.878
systems within us, which people are not understanding, that there are

00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:17.749
two channels within us.

00:20:18.599 --> 00:20:23.269
What we call as the autonomous nervous system have got

00:20:23.879 --> 00:20:29.238
parasympathetic nervous system in the center, but there are two left and right sympathetic nervous systems.

00:20:29.239 --> 00:20:32.119
And these are the system two systems that

00:20:32.729 --> 00:20:36.649
are enlightened on your fingertips by which you know

00:20:37.589 --> 00:20:40.099
exactly what is wrong with you.

00:20:40.859 --> 00:20:43.819
What centers were catching, that is self-knowledge.

00:20:44.459 --> 00:20:47.419
People will go mad, but they will not know they're getting mad.

00:20:48.269 --> 00:20:51.618
They will have cancer, they will not know they are having cancer.

00:20:53.429 --> 00:20:58.638
This indication tells you exactly what's wrong with you.

00:21:00.419 --> 00:21:06.408
Now, if you know, how to correct your centers, you can correct the centers of others also.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:14.820
Then also this another achievement is that you become collectively conscious.

00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:21.760
Means you can feel others on your fingertips. You can feel others on your fingertips.

00:21:22.829 --> 00:21:25.549
Who is the other? That's what we think.

00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:28.440
But nobody is the other.

00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:31.489
We are part and parcel of one

00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:34.460
spiritual

00:21:34.460 --> 00:21:35.840
personality.

00:21:35.849 --> 00:21:39.200
And once somebody has problem, we immediately know there's a problem.

00:21:40.169 --> 00:21:43.788
Because on the fingertips you can feel it. This is true

00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:50.539
knowledge, is not some sort of reading a book or some sort of a thing , but is a true knowledge within yourself.

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:57.469
Which you know yourself, which we call as cognitive science, which works within yourself.

00:21:57.690 --> 00:22:01.309
You don't have to go out to read anything to understand anything.

00:22:01.950 --> 00:22:04.049
Your own being itself

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.340
is a

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.349
complete computer,  I should say, which tells you what's what.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:12.880
Who is what?

00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:15.390
We have no idea as to what we are.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.370
We have

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:20.460
not been given any idea as to

00:22:21.250 --> 00:22:23.250
what potential we have.

00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:29.580
As tremendous it is. It is tremendous, and if it works it will work

00:22:30.430 --> 00:22:32.430
for you,

00:22:32.650 --> 00:22:35.910
for your family, for your children, for

00:22:36.670 --> 00:22:39.599
your city, for your nation and for the whole world.

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:46.360
So this has to become a collective understanding

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.640
within yourself, not mentally.

00:22:50.260 --> 00:22:57.940
Mental understanding is just temporary and passes over, but it's an actualization again and again I say, it's the actualization

00:22:58.480 --> 00:23:03.820
of the knowledge within yourself, then they talk only of that.

00:23:05.650 --> 00:23:08.160
They talk in the words of

00:23:08.890 --> 00:23:11.099
chakras, of the centers.

00:23:11.890 --> 00:23:17.999
That person is these, that person has got these, I have got these (unclear) on your fingertips.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.030
Which gives you a perfect answer for everything.

00:23:21.670 --> 00:23:29.550
Then it looks after you, it protects you, it guides you, as I told you, and guides you in a right way in the right

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:36.090
manner, and how it achieves things is wonderful. So we have to first and foremost

00:23:36.610 --> 00:23:38.790
understand, that we have to have that

00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:41.849
special personality of a self-realized

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:50.490
personality, which will really help and care for others. It's not just talking, it's not just reading,

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.560
,it's not just following some

00:23:53.410 --> 00:24:00.330
false guru, but it is following yourself, which is to show that you are your own master.

00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.920
You become your master, and you know everything about everything.

00:24:05.050 --> 00:24:09.479
This is the potential in all of you as I said it is not only

00:24:10.180 --> 00:24:11.710
for few people.

00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:14.639
It's not for only black, white people,

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:20.069
but it's also meant for people, who are uneducated, who are living in the villages,

00:24:20.380 --> 00:24:25.530
who are very simple people it works for all of them and when it works

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:29.399
you'll be amazed, how it transforms you and

00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:33.509
transforms others, and you become so confident about it.

00:24:33.850 --> 00:24:39.120
You don't doubt yourself, because there's an absolute knowledge on your fingertips.

00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:42.990
It is something that is within you, which you should achieve.

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:49.440
Of course for this you should know, that so far you have not known so you have to.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.009
As long as you have this attitude it will work.

00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.630
I can not force,

00:24:55.630 --> 00:25:01.920
Sahaja yoga cannot force on anyone self-realization, cannot be forced. It has to be asked for.

00:25:02.620 --> 00:25:06.059
Unless and until you knock the door. It won't work out.

00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:11.880
It works out for people only, who really want it and

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:18.420
who want to become self-realized. As a result you don't have any responsibilities.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.760
It's only the responsibility of the

00:25:22.450 --> 00:25:28.259
all-pervading power, that does everything for you. That looks after you, that

00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:35.309
guides you and takes you to the right places, to the right situations and

00:25:36.130 --> 00:25:39.360
guides you in such a manner, that you are amazed.

00:25:40.030 --> 00:25:42.030
How is it? How is it working?

00:25:42.430 --> 00:25:47.639
How is it working out?There will be no meaning left to any miracles.

00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:53.879
But these miracles are not like taking out a diamond anything like that, but it's a miracle how the

00:25:54.460 --> 00:26:01.199
circumstances will change, how people will change, how you'll become such a joyous

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.410
lovable personality.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:09.149
On this subject I don't know how many lectures i have given and there's no end to it.

00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:13.350
But I would say that you should take your realization and go

00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.720
into our

00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:18.720
programs, whatever they have, and

00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:25.080
grow into it, because you take some time to grow, like a seed sprouts, but it takes time to become a tree.

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:29.649
But hardly one month at the most and don't have to pay there also. Again

00:26:29.650 --> 00:26:33.969
I'll tell you nothing has to be paid, you just give some time to yourself

00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:38.080
and it will work out. When you have mastered it, you'll be amazed,

00:26:39.050 --> 00:26:41.529
what you can do. A month at the most.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:46.209
Some people just get it and they don't have to do anything

00:26:46.210 --> 00:26:50.800
just they know. But most of the people have to do it. It improves

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:54.039
everything: your thinking capacity,

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.180
in the sense your brains get enlightened.

00:26:58.790 --> 00:27:03.070
You become a very large hearted personality and other

00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:05.860
things that we think of

00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.849
prosperity and all that all comes through.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:15.160
This i'm just letting you like your mother would like to give a (unclear) with little chocolate on top.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:17.480
But

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:19.959
main thing is you must know yourself.

00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:25.599
How great you are, that is what every mother wants her child to know.

00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.010
That's my

00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.760
only desire is in America, if it spreads

00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:38.109
in that manner, it will all be a great thing, a great move for the whole world.

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:40.780
May God bless you. Thank you.
