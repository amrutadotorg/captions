00:00:09.896 --> 00:00:15.315
LIGNE 349 Sahasrara Puja – “The Ghost of Materialism” 3rd May 1987

00:00:15.515 --> 00:00:16.746
Thredbo, Australia

00:00:21.643 --> 00:00:28.403
Today is a very great day for all the Sahaja yogis.

00:00:32.675 --> 00:00:53.124
It was a long time back that I desired Sahasrara should be opened out,

00:00:53.324 --> 00:01:04.836
but waiting for a right time.
It was important to do it at the right time.

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:21.704
A boy in Aurangabad, quite young, asked Me a question,

00:01:21.904 --> 00:01:29.765
“Mother, this all-pervading Power of Brahmachaitanya

00:01:29.965 --> 00:01:39.916
is beyond senses, you cannot feel it through senses.

00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:46.786
How is it we are now feeling it through our senses?”

00:01:47.985 --> 00:01:55.263
This is the question he asked, and I ask you the same question.

00:01:55.876 --> 00:02:09.313
Before this, those people who got realization
could not talk about it in the way you can tell people,

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:14.643
that you can feel it on your senses.

00:02:14.906 --> 00:02:23.993
They could not explain, they could not put it into experience.

00:02:24.193 --> 00:02:31.893
Just what they did was to tell them in words,

00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:41.795
words which were telling about something,

00:02:42.042 --> 00:02:47.500
like the taste of mango, unless and until you eat the mango

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.555
how will you know the taste? By just knowing
about “it’s wonderful, it’s great, it’s fantastic,”

00:02:53.755 --> 00:03:00.450
still you have not tasted the mango.

00:03:01.372 --> 00:03:07.273
So what has happened now, was the question.

00:03:07.473 --> 00:03:10.493
Another thing was that these people got so fed up,

00:03:10.693 --> 00:03:16.083
like Gyaneshwara at the age of twenty-one, he took a samadhi.

00:03:16.284 --> 00:03:24.523
He went into a room and closed the doors
and settled down there, and he died there.

00:03:24.723 --> 00:03:32.185
All of them – even Christ got Himself crucified.

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:41.330
Because they could tell a parable, they
could tell a simile, but what had happened

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:53.773
to them that they could not explain,
and they felt so sad and so frustrated.

00:03:55.946 --> 00:04:00.585
In a way they finished their life very early.

00:04:02.465 --> 00:04:05.690
This was the question.

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:18.399
So what was the secret, can any one of you tell Me?

00:04:46.338 --> 00:04:55.759
The answer is simple, but it’s difficult to digest.

00:05:01.968 --> 00:05:15.000
The answer is that all these incarnations who came on this Earth

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:26.434
were part of the Sahasrara, were part of the
Brahmachaitanya, were part of the Adi Shakti.

00:05:29.074 --> 00:05:38.235
They came on this Earth, gave realization to
some people who were excellent, good people

00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:44.815
who had no problems; as if they came out of the ocean of love

00:05:45.015 --> 00:05:50.485
and took all of them to the ocean of love, to enjoy that ocean.

00:05:50.685 --> 00:05:56.619
As Kabira has said that “When a drop
becomes the ocean, what can I say?”

00:05:56.819 --> 00:06:00.435
(“Jub mast hue, phir kya bole?”)

00:06:04.085 --> 00:06:08.781
So many of them took to mauna, that is silence.

00:06:08.982 --> 00:06:16.752
They disappeared, they got dissolved
completely into the ocean of love.

00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:24.475
But you did not get dissolved.

00:06:27.521 --> 00:06:39.740
Something special has happened to you, that
the whole of Brahmachaitanya, the whole ocean

00:06:40.254 --> 00:06:54.487
has taken the form of a cloud – that’s
Adi Shakti – and has come on this Earth

00:06:56.875 --> 00:07:04.066
to shower the chaitanya on you people,

00:07:05.677 --> 00:07:13.415
enrich you, nurture you, develop you,

00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:29.558
by manifesting the love in such a manner that
you have entered into the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:29.925 --> 00:07:33.670
So like one pitcher which is in the River Ganges,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:38.765
you are like a cell in the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:44.280
Your entity, your personality is preserved.

00:07:44.487 --> 00:07:52.733
Despite that you feel the Brahmachaitanya through your senses

00:07:52.933 --> 00:07:59.017
and you can give realizations to others,
but you are in the body of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:59.218 --> 00:08:08.320
As long as you are in the body of Adi Shakti you can do all that.

00:08:08.521 --> 00:08:10.963
This is the greatest thing that has happened.

00:08:11.164 --> 00:08:18.611
The whole of the Sahasrara has opened
out with all the seven peethas of all the deities,

00:08:18.812 --> 00:08:21.117
who are just part and parcel of it.

00:08:21.286 --> 00:08:28.478
The whole of it has come in the form of a Mother who is humble,

00:08:28.678 --> 00:08:36.753
who is deceptive, illusive, who is Mahamaya.

00:08:40.057 --> 00:08:44.560
It’s the greatest thing that could happen to human beings and

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:54.173
to the whole universe, that now you can get
your realization, you can give realizations to others,

00:08:54.373 --> 00:09:04.189
you can understand through your senses,
through your logic what is vibrations, what it does.

00:09:04.390 --> 00:09:12.636
Just like the proof is here: all the flowers were dead last night,

00:09:12.836 --> 00:09:18.131
finished with the heat of the people who were carrying them.

00:09:18.332 --> 00:09:23.868
And then I just put some vibrated
water on them, and you see how they are.

00:09:24.069 --> 00:09:32.503
Brahmachaitanya has revived them, but
their personality is there, they are all vibrated,

00:09:32.704 --> 00:09:37.238
and they are looking so fresh and beautiful.

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:47.452
Same thing with you, you all look so fresh and
beautiful, anybody can make out a Sahaja yogi.

00:09:47.572 --> 00:09:51.766
Under these circumstances one has to understand

00:09:51.966 --> 00:09:55.505
that there are certain limitations which you have to observe.

00:09:55.706 --> 00:10:00.514
First of all, I have taken you in My body.

00:10:00.714 --> 00:10:09.599
A foreign thing has to go in the body
and it has to be looked after, nurtured.

00:10:10.893 --> 00:10:21.844
But if you become troublesome, then
you’ll be thrown out, I can’t bear you.

00:10:22.044 --> 00:10:26.424
Some people are extremely troublesome.

00:10:26.624 --> 00:10:35.283
They do not meditate, they have their own ideas about meditation,

00:10:35.483 --> 00:10:41.250
they do not develop themselves, they do not mature,

00:10:41.450 --> 00:10:48.069
they live in the past or in the future,

00:10:48.269 --> 00:10:50.731
and such people are troublesome.

00:10:50.932 --> 00:10:57.403
A simple thing I’d requested you all, to put some ghee in the nose,

00:10:57.604 --> 00:11:00.493
which is a very simple thing but is very important.

00:11:00.694 --> 00:11:10.631
You all suffer from a very bad Hamsa,
and one of the things that is a symptom

00:11:10.831 --> 00:11:16.231
in a AIDS case is a bad Hamsa.

00:11:16.557 --> 00:11:28.234
You’ll be vulnerable to AIDS – and a
small thing like that is not observed.

00:11:28.434 --> 00:11:37.749
It has to be a religious obligation that
you must listen to Me, whatever I say.

00:11:37.950 --> 00:11:40.584
Actually you must obey Me.

00:11:40.784 --> 00:11:45.917
My hand obeys Me, My fingers obey Me, My feet obey Me;

00:11:46.117 --> 00:11:52.212
what about you, who are raised to the great dignity

00:11:52.412 --> 00:12:06.482
and the great position of being the
yogis in the body of the Adi Shakti,

00:12:06.683 --> 00:12:13.949
and they are acting as cells in My body?

00:12:20.896 --> 00:12:27.509
First and foremost thing is, to do this kind of a venture,

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:33.234
to put all kinds of things in your body

00:12:33.434 --> 00:12:42.143
is a very daring thing,

00:12:42.343 --> 00:12:49.026
and the process is also very hazardous.

00:12:50.424 --> 00:13:03.451
This has to be achieved with great patience,
love, compassion and above all, hard labor.

00:13:07.124 --> 00:13:16.813
This has to be regarded as the greatest
thing, that Sahasrara was opened by Me.

00:13:17.013 --> 00:13:25.654
Of course I am the master of Sahasrara,
I am the master of all the chakras,

00:13:25.854 --> 00:13:32.046
but also I’m beyond Sahasrara, much beyond it.

00:13:32.259 --> 00:13:38.784
If that is the situation, you should be
careful about your Sahasrara – that is Me –

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:47.495
and looking after your own heart
which is the Brahmarandra peetha here,

00:13:47.695 --> 00:13:53.500
which opens out ultimately when you get your realization.

00:13:53.701 --> 00:14:01.654
Sahaja Yoga is spreading everywhere
horizontally; vertically it must also spread.

00:14:01.854 --> 00:14:08.224
And there, if you really have proper understanding of what I am,

00:14:08.424 --> 00:14:11.313
Sahasrara should be absolutely clearcut.

00:14:11.513 --> 00:14:16.473
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you
must listen to whatever I have told you,

00:14:16.673 --> 00:14:24.467
obey it as absolutely a ordained thing.

00:14:29.343 --> 00:14:33.837
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your heart.

00:14:34.038 --> 00:14:40.895
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill it up with My love?

00:14:41.096 --> 00:14:46.357
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

00:14:48.132 --> 00:14:51.566
Don’t get worried about what has happened in the past,

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:56.574
don’t get worried about what has happened in your life

00:14:56.774 --> 00:15:01.980
as far as your relationships are concerned.

00:15:02.181 --> 00:15:09.131
Such things won’t happen now in Sahaja Yoga, they cannot happen.

00:15:09.332 --> 00:15:12.893
It has been worked out that way, it cannot happen.

00:15:13.093 --> 00:15:18.304
If this hand is paining, the other hand is there to help it out.

00:15:18.505 --> 00:15:25.473
You’re not alone, you are in the body of the collective being.

00:15:25.674 --> 00:15:30.612
If there are stupid people, if there are idiotic people,

00:15:30.812 --> 00:15:35.833
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for such people.

00:15:36.033 --> 00:15:38.904
In Sanskrit language they are called as “mudhahs.”

00:15:39.105 --> 00:15:43.906
Neither this is meant for people who are over-smart

00:15:44.106 --> 00:15:51.627
and trying to cheat themselves – intelligence has that capacity –

00:15:51.827 --> 00:15:57.914
and to indulge into things which are not Sahaj.

00:15:59.583 --> 00:16:03.045
Slowly you will find your vibrations will disappear,

00:16:03.245 --> 00:16:12.018
you’ll become sick, you’ll have problems and you’ll be in trouble.

00:16:12.218 --> 00:16:22.380
This is not a kind of a warning but a request,
because you are in My body, and whenever

00:16:24.224 --> 00:16:34.474
anybody tries to be troublesome in My
body I have to bear it up, and suffer a lot.

00:16:36.812 --> 00:16:42.647
It’s a funny type of a crucifixion when every moment

00:16:42.847 --> 00:16:50.604
you are hanged onto a cross by anyone who wants to do it.

00:16:53.577 --> 00:16:58.466
Sahaja yogis have all the laws in their hands to torture My life,

00:16:58.666 --> 00:17:02.879
to trouble Me if they want to;

00:17:03.079 --> 00:17:11.229
but they have also such a capacity, such a caliber,

00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:17.955
such a potential that they can reside in My heart forever.

00:17:18.156 --> 00:17:24.324
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will say.

00:17:24.524 --> 00:17:29.744
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

00:17:29.944 --> 00:17:39.604
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the fear of the past.

00:17:39.804 --> 00:17:47.674
In the past if you have done anything wrong,
in the past we have had bad experiences of

00:17:47.874 --> 00:17:51.004
people, we are very frightened.

00:17:51.204 --> 00:18:00.314
I’ve seen, I’m surprised, I’ve seen it
Myself that in England when we were staying

00:18:00.514 --> 00:18:10.284
– it was that day unluckily or luckily it
was snowing for the first time, and we were

00:18:10.484 --> 00:18:12.724
shifting, so I had gone out.

00:18:12.931 --> 00:18:18.231
And when I came back I saw a lady and a little baby in a pram,

00:18:18.351 --> 00:18:22.830
standing at the door and talking to some lady.

00:18:22.951 --> 00:18:30.004
The other lady was just talking through
a little opening in the door, because there

00:18:30.204 --> 00:18:31.913
was a chain on.

00:18:32.113 --> 00:18:39.634
Then I went out and came back after
half-an-hour, and I saw the same thing.

00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:45.793
The lady was still standing in the snow, and
this lady was talking to her through a chink.

00:18:45.993 --> 00:18:48.264
I was surprised.

00:18:48.464 --> 00:18:53.564
What is this going like “Midsummer’s
Night’s Dream,” these people are talking to each

00:18:53.764 --> 00:18:56.814
other – horrible!

00:18:57.014 --> 00:19:02.844
What was it that was frightening to this lady
inside the room – what this lady would have

00:19:03.044 --> 00:19:06.024
done with the child, who had come to her door?

00:19:06.224 --> 00:19:09.774
What was there to be so frightened of?

00:19:09.974 --> 00:19:17.173
Because of the ego within yourself: you
have frightened others, you have tortured others,

00:19:17.373 --> 00:19:24.854
you have dominated others, you have done
all these things, so there is fear in your mind

00:19:25.054 --> 00:19:29.834
that others may do the same thing to you.

00:19:30.034 --> 00:19:34.094
Or what is there to be so much frightened,
to lock your doors to everyone who comes to

00:19:34.294 --> 00:19:39.244
your house?

00:19:39.444 --> 00:19:46.964
Secondly, maybe you might have been tortured
by someone or troubled by someone, so your

00:19:47.164 --> 00:19:50.704
heart is closed, you can’t open heart to others.

00:19:50.904 --> 00:19:54.934
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

00:19:55.134 --> 00:19:57.374
What has happened?

00:19:57.574 --> 00:20:01.634
Just like a dead body moving about.

00:20:01.834 --> 00:20:11.763
Supposing I was like this, who would have told
you the secrets of Sahaja Yoga and Sahasrara?

00:20:11.963 --> 00:20:18.304
So this kind of a nature comes from people
who are frightened in the past perhaps, or

00:20:18.504 --> 00:20:25.344
they might have frightened people with their bad Vishuddhi.

00:20:25.544 --> 00:20:29.674
Aggressiveness is one of the qualities in the West,

00:20:29.794 --> 00:20:35.434
and that also is inherited by you people.

00:20:35.555 --> 00:20:39.814
As soon as you put them onto something, they become aggressive.

00:20:40.014 --> 00:20:43.494
I can’t bear it within Myself.

00:20:43.694 --> 00:20:53.403
Supposing I have some sort of a medicine that
makes some cells very aggressive, then what happens?

00:20:53.603 --> 00:20:57.033
Ultimately I become a patient of cancer.

00:20:57.233 --> 00:21:10.344
An aggressive cell is called as the malignant
cell, and such a cell cannot give you proper

00:21:10.544 --> 00:21:18.174
attention, cannot give you proper depth,
but you become nothing but a malignant cell, a

00:21:18.374 --> 00:21:22.544
cell which is creating a cancer.

00:21:22.744 --> 00:21:26.944
And such a person creates cancer among Sahaja yogis.

00:21:27.144 --> 00:21:37.084
I’ve heard horrible stories about how some
women, some men have become aggressive.

00:21:37.284 --> 00:21:41.554
With a little position they get, immediately they become aggressive.

00:21:41.754 --> 00:21:50.804
Say somebody is a wife of a organizer,
or a so-called leader’s, then she thinks she

00:21:51.004 --> 00:21:59.964
is nothing but a prime minister or something
– or her husband becomes something.

00:22:00.164 --> 00:22:05.524
This aggressiveness adds to the aggressiveness of another person.

00:22:05.724 --> 00:22:07.344
So then reaction starts.

00:22:07.544 --> 00:22:11.644
One says something, the another says
something; we become reactionaries.

00:22:11.844 --> 00:22:17.074
We haven’t got something of our own, that we should be reactionaries?

00:22:17.274 --> 00:22:25.184
There should be no reaction to anything,
because we have something of our own.

00:22:25.384 --> 00:22:31.363
Why should we react to something, whatever
people are doing to us or have done to us?

00:22:31.563 --> 00:22:32.793
– it’s finished.

00:22:32.993 --> 00:22:34.934
Open your hearts.

00:22:35.134 --> 00:22:41.594
That’s why when you came to India, I think
you must have noticed that in the Indian heart

00:22:41.794 --> 00:22:52.033
there is nothing like an anger for say, for
English or for Portuguese, or for anybody

00:22:52.233 --> 00:22:54.364
who has dominated them.

00:22:54.564 --> 00:23:02.634
They have so much love and affection and respect,
and they see that what good you have done to them.

00:23:02.834 --> 00:23:10.274
Like some barristers came to India and they
visited some high courts, and they had holiday

00:23:10.474 --> 00:23:21.614
for one day to celebrate the visit of
these British lawyers and barristers.

00:23:21.814 --> 00:23:30.174
But if you go to England they will beat you, throw you out.

00:23:30.374 --> 00:23:36.444
This aggressiveness has to go
from your heart, it has to get out of it.

00:23:36.644 --> 00:23:45.314
There’s no place in My body for aggressive people, no place at all.

00:23:45.514 --> 00:23:53.844
I have not aggressed you, and you shouldn’t aggress Me.

00:23:54.044 --> 00:23:58.254
If you aggress any Sahaja yogi, you are aggressing Me.

00:23:58.454 --> 00:24:02.034
But when it comes to others, they won’t aggress others.

00:24:02.234 --> 00:24:10.293
Like a bad husband will aggress his wife, but not other people.

00:24:10.493 --> 00:24:14.064
So those who are non-Sahaja yogis, they do not aggress them.

00:24:14.264 --> 00:24:22.663
That’s a very important part of Sahasrara,
because ego covers a great part of Sahasrara,

00:24:22.863 --> 00:24:31.413
and if your Sahasrara is covered with this
ego business, how can I help you and how can

00:24:31.613 --> 00:24:33.324
I help Myself?

00:24:33.524 --> 00:24:46.814
Now so many of you are in My body, just
imagine, circulating fast; and most of them are fighting

00:24:47.014 --> 00:24:50.574
to be in My heart, but they are settling in My ego.

00:24:50.774 --> 00:24:59.844
Well, I am egoless, because I have no reactions.

00:25:00.044 --> 00:25:02.864
If you have no reaction you cannot develop ego.

00:25:03.064 --> 00:25:07.584
I’ve no reactions, I’m reactionless.

00:25:07.784 --> 00:25:23.564
I am in My own peace and glory, trying to work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:23.764 --> 00:25:37.074
I do not react to anything, but your reactions
trouble Me because you are within Me.

00:25:37.274 --> 00:25:43.934
Then the second part is the fear that comes from childhood.

00:25:44.134 --> 00:25:52.474
I do not know about Americans, but so many
Americans who came to Me were half-mad, cracked

00:25:52.674 --> 00:25:57.744
people, absolutely cracked in the head, nothing normal about them.

00:25:57.944 --> 00:26:02.444
Either they will not talk – if they talk
they talk irrelevantly, you don’t know what

00:26:02.644 --> 00:26:03.884
they are talking about.

00:26:04.084 --> 00:26:06.055
Same with the French.

00:26:06.255 --> 00:26:16.304
French were mad much before anybody was
mad in this world, I think; very cracky people

00:26:16.504 --> 00:26:24.104
you see, very difficult, it’s absolutely
can’t understand, everything upside-down.

00:26:24.304 --> 00:26:35.374
When you blame our Indian telephone,
you must know they were made by French.

00:26:35.574 --> 00:26:45.444
I always say that in Pune we have got the
telephone just to see, because it is called

00:26:45.644 --> 00:26:51.535
as “Punya Patnam” – means the, is
the “city of punyas” – and only God can

00:26:51.735 --> 00:26:59.624
listen to this telephone, but even God cannot!

00:26:59.824 --> 00:27:10.494
So this kind of a crackedness, or this what
you call this madness, aggressive madness,

00:27:10.694 --> 00:27:26.124
comes from ego going to the level of
super-ego; and they get first of all “what’s wrong?”

00:27:26.324 --> 00:27:32.923
When they talk you feel they are fighting,
and these are love talks, “romantic” they

00:27:33.123 --> 00:27:36.814
say, and we feel they are fighting.

00:27:37.014 --> 00:27:45.663
And then after some time the aggressiveness
is very apparent, and then it becomes as if

00:27:45.863 --> 00:27:50.354
they are off their heads, absolutely off their heads.

00:27:50.554 --> 00:27:54.614
And it’s very common with Americans, very common.

00:27:54.814 --> 00:28:04.284
You can’t find Americans when they are talking,
any good speaker, who doesn’t have twitches

00:28:04.484 --> 00:28:10.923
on his faces, on his body, everywhere, because
so many nerves have been already strained

00:28:11.123 --> 00:28:24.694
with this kind of “what’s wrong?” business
– going to the other extreme of deciding

00:28:24.894 --> 00:28:27.184
everything for yourself.

00:28:27.384 --> 00:28:42.293
And the thing behind is a ghost, I should
say, a very big ghost, and which is not in

00:28:42.493 --> 00:28:45.804
the past or the future, but in the present.

00:28:46.004 --> 00:28:47.923
And that ghost I call it as materialism.

00:28:48.123 --> 00:28:59.104
Materialism – it’s a ghost, it’s a horrible devil
that has come onto the heads of Americans,

00:28:59.304 --> 00:29:05.254
and from them to all of us.

00:29:05.454 --> 00:29:09.724
This materialism is a horrible stuff.

00:29:09.924 --> 00:29:23.114
It’s so ridiculous, shameful, doesn’t even
suit a human person; even a dog would

00:29:23.314 --> 00:29:35.554
hate such a materialism, to what level human beings have gone.

00:29:35.754 --> 00:29:42.023
This materialism makes a person absolutely shameless.

00:29:42.223 --> 00:29:53.754
A lady would not mind asking another lady,
“By the way, have you got my spoons with you?”

00:29:53.954 --> 00:29:57.474
There’s no shame in it.

00:29:57.674 --> 00:30:08.214
When we were small we were told in India
– I mean, that’s our culture – that if somebody’s

00:30:08.414 --> 00:30:16.344
pin is in your house you should preserve
it and return it, but even if your diamond is

00:30:16.544 --> 00:30:19.793
lost with somebody, never ask for it.

00:30:19.993 --> 00:30:25.064
Is not good manners.

00:30:25.264 --> 00:30:35.684
What is more valuable is not the diamond,
is the relationship, is the friendship, and

00:30:35.884 --> 00:30:40.234
the emotions of human beings to be respected.

00:30:40.434 --> 00:30:41.880
How can you ask?

00:30:42.001 --> 00:30:46.567
If there was a diamond they would have
found it and would have given it to you, but if

00:30:46.700 --> 00:30:51.819
there is no asking for that or reporting like that

00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.605
then it’s sure there’s no diamond;
and even if it is there, doesn’t matter.

00:30:55.726 --> 00:31:04.854
After all, what is a diamond? – you are
wearing or they are wearing, what does it matter?

00:31:05.054 --> 00:31:12.077
In My father’s house all the doors were
open all the time, all the doors, day and night.

00:31:12.277 --> 00:31:18.724
Never a thief came in, thought that doors are
open so nothing is locked, there’s nothing precious.

00:31:18.924 --> 00:31:28.523
Only we had one theft, and the thief came and
took away a gramophone from us, and some records.

00:31:28.723 --> 00:31:30.854
So My father said, “He’s a connoisseur.

00:31:31.054 --> 00:31:34.264
He took the right thing from this house, so let it be.

00:31:34.464 --> 00:31:42.844
What’s the use of informing the police?”

00:31:43.044 --> 00:31:55.304
So this materialism that comes in is a mad,
mad, mad dog, and gives you a disease which

00:31:55.504 --> 00:31:59.984
is worse than any disease that is possible.

00:32:00.184 --> 00:32:08.724
How people play on it, on this disease, as
you must have known that doctors when you

00:32:08.924 --> 00:32:13.624
get some disease little bit, they’ll take
out your teeth, take out your eyes, take out

00:32:13.824 --> 00:32:19.274
your nose, take out your purse and take
out everything that you have, for a little thing

00:32:19.474 --> 00:32:22.384
like malaria or something.

00:32:22.584 --> 00:32:31.364
But this disease takes away everything
that is beautiful within you, that is good within

00:32:31.564 --> 00:32:32.674
you.

00:32:32.874 --> 00:32:36.884
For example, it started a fashion.

00:32:37.084 --> 00:32:39.684
With this materialism they start fashions.

00:32:39.884 --> 00:32:44.194
Ladies are more vulnerable.

00:32:44.394 --> 00:32:52.074
Fashion starts, any sort of fashion starts,
like the sleeves to be made long – in India

00:32:52.274 --> 00:32:59.704
also they started – then make it short,
then make it half, then make it no sleeves.

00:32:59.825 --> 00:33:01.789
I said, “I am not running that race.

00:33:01.910 --> 00:33:06.643
I will have the sleeves all the time,
same sleeves so I don’t have to bother.

00:33:06.843 --> 00:33:12.444
I can tell My tailor and he can make whatever
way I want to have, the tailor, because he

00:33:12.644 --> 00:33:17.694
knows I make one style” – finished with it.

00:33:17.894 --> 00:33:20.994
Why do people want to run with the fashion?

00:33:21.194 --> 00:33:27.754
Just think of it, what is the need to run with the fashion?

00:33:27.954 --> 00:33:30.504
Now new race has started, run with it.

00:33:30.704 --> 00:33:33.344
Then another race has started, run with it.

00:33:33.544 --> 00:33:38.304
Then the third race has started, run with
it – all the time running with the mad race

00:33:38.504 --> 00:33:43.173
of fashions.

00:33:43.373 --> 00:33:50.224
Now a new race has started of fashions
not to put any oil in the head, so you become

00:33:50.424 --> 00:33:52.624
bald, then you buy wigs.

00:33:52.824 --> 00:33:58.814
It’s all entrepreneurs who are working out, it’s all enterprises.

00:33:59.014 --> 00:34:10.824
So you become absolutely bald-headed people,
then you get your wigs from them, then there

00:34:11.024 --> 00:34:15.364
is a special charge for dressing the
wigs, so you go for dressing the wigs.

00:34:15.564 --> 00:34:18.734
Goes on like mad.

00:34:18.934 --> 00:34:30.774
Then there’s another type: now a new fashion
has started in London because, you see, these

00:34:30.974 --> 00:34:32.794
people want to make some money.

00:34:32.994 --> 00:34:38.344
People don’t even have so much of logic
and intelligence left in their heads to see

00:34:38.544 --> 00:34:43.044
that what they were preaching one
day, they are just the thing against it.

00:34:43.244 --> 00:34:49.544
Formerly it was you had to wear a tail coat,
you had to have your hair absolutely done

00:34:49.744 --> 00:34:56.334
with proper hair-grooming and all
that, as you can see in the old pictures.

00:34:56.534 --> 00:35:01.544
Then it started striped three-piece suits.

00:35:01.744 --> 00:35:11.954
Now it is, I mean, few days earlier was tight
clothes, then they developed varicose veins, you see.

00:35:12.154 --> 00:35:17.634
So no, no – now it is the fashion to wear absolutely loose dresses.

00:35:17.834 --> 00:35:23.454
I saw the other day one lady making a
dress out of a big blanket, going like this.

00:35:23.654 --> 00:35:31.934
I thought she was some priest or someone!

00:35:32.134 --> 00:35:35.154
So that stupidity has started.

00:35:35.354 --> 00:35:45.254
Imagine – think of Sahasrara, think of Divine,
in what world we are, and in what world the

00:35:45.454 --> 00:35:49.214
stupid people are going.

00:35:49.414 --> 00:35:57.394
That’s another world, absolutely another
stupid world where people just go after nonsensical

00:35:57.594 --> 00:36:03.954
things, changing from one to another, changing
from everything: ties are changed, everything

00:36:04.154 --> 00:36:06.004
is changed, giving you such a headache.

00:36:06.125 --> 00:36:08.963
All the time you have to think, “Now what fashion is there?

00:36:09.084 --> 00:36:11.114
Let’s find out in the newspaper.

00:36:11.235 --> 00:36:15.554
What is – this is the fashion now. All right, wear this dress.”

00:36:15.754 --> 00:36:20.824
All this is befooling going on,
because this ghost has entered into us.

00:36:21.024 --> 00:36:31.614
In Sahaja Yoga also when we enter, be careful,
materialism should not enter into your minds.

00:36:31.814 --> 00:36:37.534
It’s nothing important.

00:36:37.734 --> 00:36:43.424
Even when somebody dies you are supposed
to wear something black, or white or I don’t

00:36:43.624 --> 00:36:45.854
know what else, but white or black.

00:36:46.060 --> 00:36:52.288
And somebody died in England who was a great friend of My husband,

00:36:52.408 --> 00:36:56.674
and I had no black sari, completely
black. I mean we don’t have such a sari.

00:36:56.874 --> 00:36:58.124
I didn’t know what to do.

00:36:58.324 --> 00:37:02.744
I told My husband I don’t have a black
sari. He said, “Then You don’t come.”

00:37:02.944 --> 00:37:08.484
Imagine how his wife would feel if I
don’t go to the thing, how she would take it.

00:37:08.684 --> 00:37:15.764
All this is nothing, what is important is the black sari!

00:37:15.964 --> 00:37:23.544
In every walk of life you are being befooled by this materialism.

00:37:23.744 --> 00:37:29.404
I don’t know how you got stuck into it first of all.

00:37:29.604 --> 00:37:32.274
And the other side is, the same people are befooling you.

00:37:32.474 --> 00:37:38.384
“All right, this is not good, this is
too much” – so go to the anti-culture.

00:37:38.584 --> 00:37:44.224
What is anti-culture is another kind of
materialism, another kind of nonsense.

00:37:44.424 --> 00:37:51.024
Nowadays they are having in this London an
anti-culture movement which is called as “punks.”

00:37:51.224 --> 00:37:57.654
I think out of date now Me, but still
what’s for the time being as I see is punks.

00:37:57.854 --> 00:38:01.164
It costs them forty pounds sometimes to make that hair.

00:38:01.364 --> 00:38:09.974
I mean, is it something that you are saving money on that?

00:38:10.174 --> 00:38:17.234
So the whole thing works out just to take
out your attention from reality, from higher

00:38:17.434 --> 00:38:25.744
values, to something nonsensical.

00:38:25.944 --> 00:38:35.967
In Sahaja Yoga also people must learn to lead a life of collectivity.

00:38:36.168 --> 00:38:41.754
It’s very important that we have to be collective.

00:38:41.954 --> 00:38:47.904
We shouldn’t talk of “This is mine, this is mine, and this I own.”

00:38:48.105 --> 00:38:51.046
Even about children you should not do like that,

00:38:51.246 --> 00:39:02.764
“This is my own child, this is my own
baby. This is my brother, this is my sister.”

00:39:02.964 --> 00:39:06.641
This “my, my” should go away; but that’s not possible,

00:39:06.841 --> 00:39:13.864
it’s not easy to forget about it because
left Nabhi and right Nabhi has to be all right.

00:39:14.064 --> 00:39:21.139
The only way to do it is that “Mother, it’s all Yours.”

00:39:21.339 --> 00:39:30.313
It’s not dangerous to say that, because I’ll
never take anything that is supposed to be yours.

00:39:30.514 --> 00:39:35.689
Just to say, “Mother, it’s all Yours,” to start it – “It’s all Yours.

00:39:35.890 --> 00:39:43.054
I am Yours, my heart is Yours, all
my things are Yours, my life is Yours.”

00:39:43.254 --> 00:39:48.184
Even saying that is a big mantra for Sahasrara.

00:39:48.384 --> 00:39:54.042
The deity of Sahasrara is a very simple person,

00:39:54.242 --> 00:39:58.967
extremely simple, and can be moved with very little actions,

00:39:59.167 --> 00:40:02.973
can be pleased with very few little actions here and there.

00:40:03.174 --> 00:40:07.531
Not much is needed to please the deity of Sahasrara.

00:40:07.732 --> 00:40:16.804
It’s a very simple person; little things make Her happy.

00:40:17.618 --> 00:40:22.483
Yesterday you had brought the flowers, and I didn’t take them.

00:40:22.691 --> 00:40:24.058
You all must have thought,

00:40:24.258 --> 00:40:27.917
“What’s it, we couldn’t give flowers to Mother, holding in our hand.”

00:40:28.118 --> 00:40:32.905
But I wanted to show this miracle to you, that’s why I didn’t take.

00:40:33.106 --> 00:40:38.430
And I took it in the end, and see now
they are the best among all of them;

00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:43.418
don’t they look as if they have been plucked from the tree?

00:40:44.554 --> 00:40:49.655
Just I wanted to show this, so I said, “I’m tired,” I sat down

00:40:49.855 --> 00:40:56.867
and then I looked at you with the flowers,
you see, in the hands, you’re sitting all of you!

00:41:05.966 --> 00:41:08.444
So She is Leela Vinodini.

00:41:08.644 --> 00:41:16.782
She plays around, makes little mischiefs
here and there for you to learn lessons.

00:41:16.976 --> 00:41:23.586
Because if I tell you “Do this” then
it’s not possible, but little circuitous way

00:41:23.787 --> 00:41:28.198
I can show you that this is wrong, you should not do it.

00:41:28.399 --> 00:41:32.069
There’s nothing to feel bad, I would have taken all the flowers;

00:41:32.269 --> 00:41:37.009
but somebody must have thought of it,
why Mother has not taken the flowers today.

00:41:37.210 --> 00:41:41.549
I don’t know if you thought of it or not,

00:41:41.749 --> 00:41:48.331
but I knew it Myself that I have to take
the flowers to show this miracle to them,

00:41:48.531 --> 00:41:52.875
that these flowers are going to last
much longer than any other flowers,

00:41:53.075 --> 00:41:57.846
because they are vibrated with the Brahmachaitanya.

00:41:58.046 --> 00:42:03.663
And the water was very, very, very
cold, so even I opened a hot water tap.

00:42:03.864 --> 00:42:11.736
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, they didn’t
die, despite that they are perfectly all right.

00:42:11.936 --> 00:42:15.852
So you have seen so many miracles of this Brahmachaitanya

00:42:16.052 --> 00:42:21.599
which is showing on your photographs, on so many your lives,

00:42:21.799 --> 00:42:26.153
in so many changes that have taken place within yourself,

00:42:26.353 --> 00:42:30.396
within your family, within every one of you.

00:42:30.596 --> 00:42:35.305
All this has happened because you are in Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:35.506 --> 00:42:41.036
All this you are receiving because you are blessed by Brahmachaitanya.

00:42:41.491 --> 00:42:45.613
But others are not, so your attitude should be towards them

00:42:45.814 --> 00:42:49.983
that they are in the other world – what to do, how to help them?

00:42:50.184 --> 00:42:55.746
We should try to help them if possible, but up to a point.

00:42:56.196 --> 00:42:59.369
We should not drag down ourselves for others’ sake.

00:42:59.569 --> 00:43:01.990
Up to a point only we can help them,

00:43:02.190 --> 00:43:07.896
and we have to be very happy that Sahaja
Yoga is spreading so much horizontally.

00:43:08.296 --> 00:43:12.736
But for vertical thing we must know our quality must improve.

00:43:12.937 --> 00:43:18.110
If some people rise higher, others will also start rising with them.

00:43:18.311 --> 00:43:23.586
It’s the absolute honesty of purpose should be there,

00:43:23.786 --> 00:43:27.116
absolutely understanding should be there.

00:43:27.316 --> 00:43:31.471
Open your hearts to each other, so that you open your hearts to Me.

00:43:31.672 --> 00:43:36.878
Every cell must know another cell, otherwise it won’t work out.

00:43:37.079 --> 00:43:42.789
That is a great thing that has happened, when you are on this Earth,

00:43:42.989 --> 00:43:49.171
when you are the ones who have to receive this great blessing.

00:43:49.372 --> 00:43:53.165
So many saints did not receive it,

00:43:53.365 --> 00:43:57.293
so many great people who came on this Earth, they did not receive it.

00:43:57.494 --> 00:44:03.473
Even the incarnations who came on this
Earth could not do it what you are doing.

00:44:03.674 --> 00:44:07.955
So have that satisfaction and glory

00:44:08.155 --> 00:44:12.564
of your own being and of your own standard, and of your own caliber.

00:44:12.765 --> 00:44:17.726
The others are not of your caliber, all right, forget about it.

00:44:18.204 --> 00:44:26.113
That should not give you ego, but should
give you a personality that does not react.

00:44:26.314 --> 00:44:32.146
We have something of our own, we do not react to things.

00:44:34.023 --> 00:44:37.347
We are not reactionaries.

00:44:37.548 --> 00:44:41.986
And things will disappear which are harmful.

00:44:42.186 --> 00:44:45.357
Everything will be perfectly all right,

00:44:45.557 --> 00:44:50.528
because we are standing in our own perfection, in our own glory.

00:44:50.728 --> 00:44:52.161
What do we need?

00:44:52.361 --> 00:44:55.439
Nothing, just enjoying ourselves.

00:44:58.659 --> 00:45:01.252
May God bless you all.
