00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:00,417
Diwali Puja, Los Angeles, USA November 18, 2001

2
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,660
It’s a very, very great day today, I should say,

3
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:34,750
where the evil has been suppressed.

4
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:14,580
The evil that spreads its power all over

5
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,830
is only because of two factors.

6
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,660
One is that you are not knowledgeable,

7
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:32,580
you are still blind,

8
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,870
and you follow things

9
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,620
which are not right but you think are powerful.

10
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:51,540
This illusion creates not only problems,

11
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,870
but absolute destruction.

12
00:04:59,910 --> 00:05:03,790
So we faced a very big challenge, no doubt

13
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:12,660
and it was easily solved.

14
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,620
It was based on all wrong basis,

15
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,660
just to create a problem.

16
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:32,830
Problem was created with a purpose,

17
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,700
and nobody could imagine

18
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:47,910
that it would be solved so easily and so quickly.

19
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:55,870
My desire was to get over it before Diwali that has happened.

20
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,540
Due to ignorance also, people do lots of things.

21
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:26,660
Anybody who follows some religion or some sort of a thing,

22
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:32,660
it’s only because they’re not aware of the truth,

23
00:06:33,580 --> 00:06:37,660
they’re ignorant about achieving the truth,

24
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:42,660
and they cling on to the fact

25
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,540
that they know everything.

26
00:06:46,910 --> 00:06:49,750
With all this happening,

27
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,500
there have been so many fractions,

28
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,870
so many stupid people

29
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,540
who are getting completely ruined by ignorance.

30
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,660
Now that we’re coming to Sahaja Yoga,

31
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:16,540
you know all the knowledge – very subtle knowledge,

32
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,830
very subtle. It’s not superficial knowledge,

33
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,700
it is very subtle.

34
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,910
And because they don’t know this subtle knowledge,

35
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,830
they fall into the wrong path of,

36
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:39,660
I should say, ignorance and then they try to oppose

37
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:42,500
the people who are doing good.

38
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,540
But above all is the power of God.

39
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:55,580
All this drama is played to prove the existence

40
00:07:55,790 --> 00:07:57,750
of that great Power.

41
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:01,790
It has all worked out so well,

42
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:04,870
and for all of you Sahaja yogis

43
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:10,500
it’s a very great achievement that you can see the play.

44
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,830
Many people who have achieved

45
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,830
so-called success cannot see that point,

46
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:23,540
but you can see it because you are spectators.

47
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,500
Though all the world is a part and parcel of that drama,

48
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,830
you are outside and you can see it so clearly.

49
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:38,950
Whatever has happened, nobody could have believed

50
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,950
that would finish before Diwali.

51
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,620
So it goes like this, the stupidity

52
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,700
which is being created;

53
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:54,000
and we also sometimes think that this kind of stupid thing

54
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:58,910
will impress others. Impression is not the point.

55
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:05,540
If you see among all these people who have lost,

56
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,660
what impression have they created?

57
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:13,700
They were there to create a great impression on everyone,

58
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,580
to show as if they were great warriors and fighters.

59
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,000
But what impression they have created?

60
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:27,700
Whether you are a realized soul or not,

61
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,580
they can see that it’s a miracle,

62
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,830
it’s a miracle how things have worked out.

63
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:48,660
Now the new phase has started.

64
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,660
You all have a very, very open challenge

65
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,870
to get people into enlightenment.

66
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,950
People are not so ignorant now,

67
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,830
they are not so much blasted.

68
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:14,660
Moreover, I find them very much changed.

69
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,540
Their attitude towards truth has changed,

70
00:10:21,950 --> 00:10:23,830
and they understand

71
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:27,830
there is truth beyond all this that they have known.

72
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,700
It’s very important,

73
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:37,540
because if a human being starts thinking

74
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:40,750
“this is the truth,” he just gets stuck up.

75
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:44,620
At any cost, whatever may happen,

76
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,950
he’ll go on sticking to that.

77
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:54,580
He won’t be able even to verify whether it is the truth or not.

78
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,910
Animals can. How? Because they have got innate capacity

79
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,910
to smell the evil – innate.

80
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,950
We cannot, human beings cannot.

81
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:15,000
If there’s a evil man, a dog will bark at him.

82
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:22,660
Otherwise he’ll go and throw him down.

83
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,750
He’ll do everything which is not normally done.

84
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:34,950
How is it he has developed this capacity to find out

85
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,660
who is a thief and who is not?

86
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,950
We have a higher awareness.

87
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:48,540
We think about many things which animals cannot think.

88
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,870
We understand many things which animals cannot understand.

89
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,790
We cook our food – they don’t.

90
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:04,660
But also I sometimes, I think we cook our brains,

91
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:10,580
because the way people behave

92
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:17,500
and try to avoid the truth with their ego is surprising.

93
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,910
All this happening

94
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:24,830
is a drama, as I told you, but you better study it  properly

95
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:28,040
and apply it to yourself, and see

96
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:31,870
if you are also a part and parcel of that drama.

97
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,950
For that, you have to rise higher.

98
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,660
You have to rise higher

99
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:47,580
– higher above your ego and your superego, your conditioning,

100
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,910
and from there to watch yourself and see yourself:

101
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:58,540
“What is this? Why am I doing such a thing?

102
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,660
Why my attention is like that?

103
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,580
What is the main reason

104
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:10,580
for my own

105
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:15,700
possession, I should say, or my own

106
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:21,910
misunderstandings? Why do I accept wrong things?”

107
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,750
Once you’ll start seeing that,

108
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,950
and if you find even a wee bit of such

109
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,500
nonsensical understanding within you,

110
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:36,580
then you can forgive also people

111
00:13:36,830 --> 00:13:40,620
who have been absolutely brainwashed,

112
00:13:41,870 --> 00:13:44,040
absolutely brainwashed,

113
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:48,910
and they did everything under that influence.

114
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:55,830
As it is now you have risen much higher

115
00:13:56,870 --> 00:13:59,540
than all these people,

116
00:14:00,950 --> 00:14:06,620
and much more aware than all of them.

117
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:12,540
So you have to just understand this point,

118
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:17,540
and then you can forgive all the mistakes they have committed.

119
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:26,660
And for the people who are actually bad,

120
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,950
you don’t have to worry.

121
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:35,750
That’s the work of the divine Power to destroy them.

122
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,750
But watch yourself and see for yourself

123
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:48,950
if you have any of such ideas, any lingering idea.

124
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,870
You should try to cleanse the mirror

125
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,790
so you see your complete image

126
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,620
and try, you can then try to cleanse it.

127
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:16,700
It’s very important that you should cleanse yourself.

128
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:28,830
There are people who have done lots of wrong things.

129
00:15:29,910 --> 00:15:32,500
I simply pity them.

130
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:38,040
If they have done wrong things, it is their responsibility

131
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,660
to see what they have been doing.

132
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,830
Why have they been doing like that?

133
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,870
What is the need to do that?

134
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:56,040
All this introspection will work out so well.

135
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,790
Then your real powers will come out

136
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,750
– your powers of giving realization,

137
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:16,660
your powers to understand the problems of your country,

138
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:21,830
of the whole world.

139
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:28,040
And once you feel that you are the soldier to fight it out,

140
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:31,700
you have the responsibility to fight it out,

141
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,870
then things will work out.

142
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:40,830
We cannot leave everything to the divine Power.

143
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:48,080
You have to use the divine Power, and you have to work it out

144
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:52,540
because you are the soldiers of divine Power.

145
00:16:54,580 --> 00:17:01,910
Of course, with that beautiful idea

146
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:09,660
we start cleansing ourselves. You need not know everything

147
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,160
as to what things are happening and how they are happening,

148
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:18,160
how they are working out. That’s not your work.

149
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,660
You are a soldier so you have to just fight,

150
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,620
fight the ignorance – your own and of others.

151
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,620
Because mostly soldiers fail when they have their egos.

152
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:43,200
When they fail, they have other obstacles in their minds.

153
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:50,040
There should be no obstacle, but you should just  push forward

154
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:54,540
and know there’s no obstacle at all.

155
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,120
It’s just a myth that there are some obstacles

156
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,660
and that you cannot do it.

157
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,830
It’s not easy to raise the awareness of people,

158
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,750
because looks there’s a very little distance

159
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,660
of crossing over, but it’s not so – it’s not.

160
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:25,080
It is a very difficult task sometimes

161
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:33,700
for some people to get out of the bandhans of Agnya.

162
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,160
At that point I find some of you fail.

163
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,700
And for that, best thing is to introspect.

164
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:49,580
When you think you are always correct and you are all right,

165
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,830
it’s best is to introspect,

166
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,200
“Am I doing everything right?

167
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:05,040
How am I working for my betterment?”

168
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,790
The illusion is such

169
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,750
that sometimes you think you are doing very well.

170
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,870
Say, in our Sahaja Yoga some people are very forward type;

171
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:18,620
they’ll come forward, they’ll do this, do that.

172
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,620
But inside, what is the purpose?  The purpose is that

173
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:28,700
people should see that you are doing this work, that work.

174
00:19:31,830 --> 00:19:33,000
The purpose should be

175
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,910
that you should be able to see yourself within.

176
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:41,660
You must see what is the problem inside,

177
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:48,200
and you can very well understand

178
00:19:49,660 --> 00:19:55,500
that you have been of great help to yourself and to others.

179
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:03,540
For example, there’s a very big building,

180
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,580
and all the buildings in the nearby area

181
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:15,870
may fall down due to earthquake, but this one building

182
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:22,830
which will be standing erect. The reason is that that building

183
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:27,160
is constructed on very solid grounds.

184
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,700
In the same way

185
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:33,080
if Sahaja Yoga is constructed on a very sound wall,

186
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,950
nobody can destroy it, nobody can distort it;

187
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:42,910
and every person has to do that.

188
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,120
For example, some people told Me,

189
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,910
“Your Sahaja yogis, you know, are like this, and that

190
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,660
they are big show-offs and that.”

191
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,950
I said, “Really? I can’t believe it

192
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:01,160
that they could be like that.

193
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,830
” I said, “I would like to meet them, whosoever they are.”

194
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:19,160
So they said, “No, You can find them out Yourself

195
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:24,200
who are those people and why they behave like that.”

196
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:29,080
I said, “Myself I know everything,

197
00:21:30,870 --> 00:21:33,660
but I want you to know everything.”

198
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Finding faults with others is a very nice thing, very easy also

199
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,910
– but find out faults within yourself.

200
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:48,580
What are these things that are strangling us?

201
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,200
This is the best way of improving your awareness.

202
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:07,660
Like you are going in the car and you have to know the road,

203
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,620
you have to know how you are driving,

204
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:15,790
you have to see what are the problems.

205
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,950
But instead of you think, oh, no end of yourself

206
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,040
– it won’t work out.

207
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:29,870
Today is a day of very great happening, I should say.

208
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:34,830
Celebrating the Diwali is a very, very

209
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,080
joyous thing.

210
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,660
But this joy is not for ourselves;

211
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:51,620
this joy is for the whole world.

212
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,200
We have to work for the whole world.

213
00:22:55,910 --> 00:23:01,160
We work for ourselves, for our jobs, for our money, whatever it is,

214
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:06,540
but what are you doing for others?

215
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:10,620
That you should see for yourself,

216
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:17,950
that’s very important. Only such people are useful in Sahaja Yoga

217
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:24,040
because they have concern, they have care,

218
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:27,000
and they are doing something for others.

219
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:33,500
It’s a great enjoyment with that, when the lights are burning,

220
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:39,870
it’s to give you happiness; they are burning their bodies

221
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:45,620
to give you happiness. They are the ones who should teach us

222
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:48,830
that we have to do something ourselves

223
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:54,000
to enjoy our own higher awareness.

224
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:03,120
All this will work out, I am sure. I am also trying My best

225
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:10,910
to make this light unshaky

226
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:17,500
and full of enthusiasm.

227
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,660
It’s there. It is you who are

228
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:30,080
anxious to fill your pitchers.

229
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,750
You can do it.

230
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:39,870
It’s not My anxiety that’s going to help you.

231
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,910
So you’ll start, and even if you want to have

232
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:50,660
complete picture about yourself,

233
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:58,540
you have to first give up identification with yourself;

234
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:04,200
otherwise you’ll never know what’s wrong with you.

235
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,000
If you are too much identified with you, you cannot come up.

236
00:25:10,870 --> 00:25:15,160
Now as it is, what is the aim after all,

237
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,160
what is the aim of our lives?

238
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:28,160
We have to change the whole world into a peaceful theme.

239
00:25:31,950 --> 00:25:35,000
Changing yourself, of course, is great thing, no doubt;

240
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:42,120
but changing others also will stop all the problems of the world.

241
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:46,910
If all the people of this world become good people, Sahaja yogis,

242
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:50,500
then can you imagine what will happen?

243
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:53,040
Think of that dream I have,

244
00:25:53,830 --> 00:26:00,660
that we have to change each and every person that we can change,

245
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,700
and we have to transform them into good people.

246
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,660
If they are not transformed

247
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:11,200
they are like a candle without any flame in it.

248
00:26:11,950 --> 00:26:16,750
And if they are capable of getting transformed,

249
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:24,200
we should try all methods, all the tricks to do that.

250
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:29,870
I’m sure very soon such a day will come when you will say,

251
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,040
“Mother, now we are very safe.”

252
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,500
Don’t think of the past and the problems of the past

253
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,500
– you have now overcome it.

254
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:48,580
Just enjoy yourself and have faith in yourself,

255
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:55,500
and work it out. I am sure very soon it will happen,

256
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:02,500
very quickly it will happen. It is your desire, also

257
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,660
your method of working it out,

258
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:11,200
your anxiety to work it out.

259
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:15,910
Main anxiety should be, “How can I transform this person?”

260
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,000
You can transform anyone.

261
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,910
You know, you tell one person, another person follows it.

262
00:27:25,790 --> 00:27:27,870
Like when we came in the plane,

263
00:27:28,870 --> 00:27:31,750
I found at the airport so many people

264
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,580
had put up their hands towards Me like this.

265
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:38,660
I said, “Who are these people?” They were not Sahaja yogis.

266
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,540
They had seen somebody, or what had happened I couldn’t ask them,

267
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,540
but all of them said, “We are feeling the cool breeze in the hand.

268
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,080
” They didn’t know anything about it,

269
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,700
they didn’t know about kundalini, nothing.

270
00:27:53,870 --> 00:27:55,870
Then what is this cool coming?

271
00:27:56,830 --> 00:28:01,660
That basically they are there to get their realization,

272
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,580
only we have to extend our ideals,

273
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,080
we have to extend our love to them.

274
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:14,080
Instead of getting annoyed with them,

275
00:28:14,910 --> 00:28:17,700
better is to give them a chance

276
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:24,870
and you’ll be amazed that they are very anxious to get transformed.

277
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:30,200
They’re all fed up with all the artificial things they’re having.

278
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:34,950
It’s over now. You will be amazed

279
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:39,950
how many are waiting there for you to give them Self-realization

280
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:45,910
and let them celebrate their Diwali with you, enjoy the Diwali.

281
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,540
Diwali you cannot celebrate with one candle.

282
00:28:54,910 --> 00:28:57,910
You have to have more and more of candles,

283
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:00,790
and that’s what is your job.

284
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:05,040
Only by your own candle you are going to do it; it’s your own,

285
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:12,040
and it can enlighten anyone. Then why not use it,

286
00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,120
at any cost, at any place?

287
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,870
I have met some Sahaja yogis.

288
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:28,540
I asked them, “What did you do?”

289
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,870
They said, “No, nothing.”

290
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:33,540
“Nothing? You did nothing?”

291
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,750
“No, nothing.”

292
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:40,200
Then what’s the use of getting realization?

293
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:43,120
If you have done nothing,

294
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:46,700
you don’t want to give realization to anyone,

295
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:51,160
don’t want to talk to anyone, you feel so shy about it?

296
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:56,580
Then I met some who said, “Just now, Mother,

297
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,870
we are coming from a program.”

298
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,080
“How are you so late?”

299
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,790
“Because they told us there’s a bomb scare.”

300
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,620
“So you were waiting outside?”

301
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:13,950
“Yes.” “How many?”

302
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:17,660
“All of us.  Thousands were waiting.

303
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,790
There was no bomb, they said there’s no bomb.

304
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,750
So we went inside and we all got realization.”

305
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,120
“But you were realized souls?”

306
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,910
“No, we had our realization,

307
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,950
that sometimes we have to wait too.

308
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,620
And now we are convinced that nobody can harm us,

309
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,700
nobody can trouble us, overpower us.

310
00:30:40,910 --> 00:30:43,040
Only we do it to ourselves.”

311
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:46,500
So again I will say introspection

312
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:49,910
is very, very important in Sahaja Yoga.

313
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:54,950
When the light inside is there, you have to look after it.

314
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,950
I was extremely happy to hear from many people

315
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:09,870
that they felt the blessings of Diwali.

316
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:16,000
But you see, yesterday you had these showers

317
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:20,500
– how timely they were! It never happened,

318
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:24,790
in the history of this world it never happened;

319
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:29,950
why yesterday these showers came in and tried to

320
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:34,700
give a new experience of the showers?

321
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,910
All this is a time, we should say,

322
00:31:39,660 --> 00:31:46,500
that even the nature knows and we should also know,

323
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,950
that this is the time for a special thing.

324
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,000
Normally I get letters

325
00:31:55,870 --> 00:32:00,580
about people who are sick and their parents are sick or their ...

326
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:02,870
this is sick, all kinds of things.

327
00:32:03,620 --> 00:32:05,950
Then somebody’s marriage is broken;

328
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:10,000
then somebody has children, they are sick –

329
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:15,040
??? all kinds of nonsensical problems, they do it.

330
00:32:16,870 --> 00:32:18,000
The reason is they

331
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,620
themselves, those who write are not realized souls,

332
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:23,870
or maybe they are halfway,

333
00:32:24,700 --> 00:32:26,660
because they could themself say

334
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:28,750
that “Why should we write to Mother?

335
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,910
We can get it done ourselves.”

336
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,580
Instead of that, one has to write

337
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:40,540
what they have achieved, how they have achieved very much,

338
00:32:40,870 --> 00:32:44,660
how they have got love from others,

339
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,950
how they have worked out Sahaja Yoga in small villages.

340
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:53,080
All this is much better to write,

341
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,950
than to write, “My mother is sick, my father is sick.”

342
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:02,870
All these relationships, they go on killing you.

343
00:33:03,910 --> 00:33:06,950
So no more is your brother, nobody is your sister;

344
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:11,830
only Sahaja yogis are your brothers and sisters.

345
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:16,660
Now you have some cousin and it’s cousin’s cousin and....

346
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:20,950
So let it be. That’s not your job,

347
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,950
you don’t have to work it out.

348
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:27,950
Even before coming I got letters like that:

349
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:31,790
somebody cousin’s cousin’s ... this thing.

350
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:35,700
So I asked this lady, I said,

351
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,790
“Why do you write all these things

352
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:42,500
all the time about this cousin and that cousin?”

353
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:45,580
She says, “Mother, I am trying to spread Sahaja Yoga.”

354
00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:46,950
“How?”

355
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:51,200
“Because if they’ll be cured, then they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.”

356
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:55,120
This is not the way we want to spread Sahaja Yoga.

357
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,580
This looks like advertising or something,

358
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:03,200
speciality that you should cure somebody,

359
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:06,040
then some people will come to Sahaja Yoga.

360
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:09,200
We just don’t want such people to come.

361
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:15,000
I don’t want to hurt, but I want to give you courage

362
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,660
and understanding, and the wisdom.

363
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,910
What, why are we Sahaja yogis here

364
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,080
– just to cure all the relations of ours?

365
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:31,000
They may be sick because of some mistakes they have committed.

366
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,580
Instead of paying attention to all these such people,

367
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:42,080
you should pay attention to yourself and to your ascent.

368
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,120
You have to respect yourself.

369
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:48,540
If you are their relation, it’s none of your business.

370
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:53,790
Like understanding,

371
00:34:54,750 --> 00:35:01,200
wisdom that we have come here for a

372
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:06,200
very,  very special work of very high quality:

373
00:35:07,830 --> 00:35:12,750
that is not there. Then all such people write to Me.

374
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,580
Now one lady got married in Sahaja Yoga

375
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:21,950
and she wrote to Me that “I was divorced

376
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,000
about eight months back or nine months back, whatever it is.

377
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,870
And all my relations are now saying,

378
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:32,950
‘Why did you marry in Sahaja Yoga?’

379
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:36,750
And everybody is criticizing me and Sahaja Yoga.”

380
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:42,950
I said, “Who asked her to marry?” I never asked her.

381
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:47,500
So now the marriage has become the main point for her,

382
00:35:47,950 --> 00:35:50,870
that “all my family people are saying ...

383
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,160
” What did they do for Sahaja Yoga?

384
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,830
If this marriage doesn’t become

385
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,910
all right, then they will say there’s

386
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:02,080
something wrong with Sahaja Yoga. Let them say.

387
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:08,700
We have not committed that way.

388
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,700
Every time I have told you that don’t write to Me for your mother,

389
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:15,910
father, this, that.

390
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,540
If you don’t know how to cure them, better give up Sahaja Yoga.

391
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:24,950
You yourself can cure them

392
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,830
you can work it out yourself.

393
00:36:29,750 --> 00:36:33,830
But you should see it, so many letters every day for Me.

394
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:39,660
I ask them, “Is your father in Sahaja Yoga?”

395
00:36:39,870 --> 00:36:40,870
“Mother?" " No.”

396
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,500
“Brother?” “No, nobody.”

397
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,500
So why are you asking Me?

398
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,660
What relationship I have with them?

399
00:36:53,500 --> 00:36:56,950
They’re not Sahaja yogis. I am only responsible for Sahaja yogis.

400
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,910
They are not Sahaja yogis, so why do you want to trouble Me?

401
00:37:03,830 --> 00:37:06,540
It is impossible to understand.

402
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,120
In Sahaja Yoga you are supposed to get Self-realization, all right.

403
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,500
Then those who want to have Self-realization,

404
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:22,620
you can give them and fix them properly.

405
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,120
But instead of that somebody who is hanging in the air

406
00:37:27,790 --> 00:37:31,580
and who is falling from the airport to some other place,

407
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:33,120
all kinds of things

408
00:37:33,830 --> 00:37:38,700
– all this is really maddening, and is sickening.

409
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:43,700
I’m not concerned; you should not be concerned also.

410
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,580
What you should do is to see

411
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:51,080
that these people who're talking about it should come to Sahaja Yoga

412
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,000
And you must tell them,

413
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,580
“Because you are not doing Sahaja Yoga, that’s why it is like that”

414
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,540
or “That person is not doing Sahaja Yoga,

415
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,660
that’s why this is the problem is. We are all right, we are happy"

416
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,750
Because Sahaja Yoga is an open thing,

417
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,200
so everybody comes there.

418
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:17,040
I would request you on a Diwali day

419
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:22,000
to promise to yourself, “I will not waste my energy

420
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,790
on people who are not Sahaja yogis.

421
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,160
” It’s very important,

422
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:34,200
because all the time the attention is on wrong things

423
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,040
and on wrong basis.

424
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,580
If you have some intelligence

425
00:38:42,910 --> 00:38:46,000
you must know that now you belong

426
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:53,870
to a very high-quality spiritual people,

427
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,080
which are very few. In this world

428
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:06,950
they are very few, and you must make a concentrated effort

429
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:14,120
to see that this quality

430
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,200
must be in so many people,

431
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,200
and there must be lots of aspiration about it.

432
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:26,080
Find out such people, tell them

433
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:29,040
you have found it – “you can also get it.”

434
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,080
But don’t worry about things

435
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:37,160
which are of no value to us.

436
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,580
You must know you are a special race.

437
00:39:41,830 --> 00:39:43,870
You are special soldiers

438
00:39:44,870 --> 00:39:49,950
who have been trained

439
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,700
for doing Sahaj work only.

440
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,910
So wasting energy on your relations

441
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,080
and brothers and sisters is no good for you.

442
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:08,910
It is to be understood now

443
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:15,120
that you have your own energy reserved

444
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:20,830
– for what? For Sahaja yogis only.

445
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:28,540
You should help everyone

446
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:31,700
who is a Sahaja yogi

447
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:34,200
or who wants to become a Sahaja yogi.

448
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,700
Who are established Sahaja yogis,

449
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:43,160
you must help them; because we are one Personality

450
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,870
and these are all the different hands

451
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:52,660
of one Personality, one God.

452
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:58,750
So this oneness must be established

453
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:06,120
within yourself, and also others should see that oneness in you.

454
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,660
There are some people who are very active.

455
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:17,620
There are some people who are very active in criticizing.

456
00:41:22,910 --> 00:41:25,580
All that will work out, I’m sure,

457
00:41:25,870 --> 00:41:31,790
because this is the year of great achievements and great success;

458
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,910
but with that if you start doing something nonsensical,

459
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:39,790
nothing will work out.

460
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,870
Of course, I don’t say that we haven’t got such Sahaja yogis

461
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:52,790
with us – we have. We have all the soldiers with us, no doubt.

462
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:57,160
All the armament they have, everything they have;

463
00:41:57,910 --> 00:41:59,750
but we need more.

464
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,160
And for that we have to work out collectively,

465
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,830
must plan what should we do.

466
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:14,000
Recently there has been a big

467
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:19,790
argument about the Islamic behavior of people.

468
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:24,620
We are neither Christians nor Islamic nor anything.

469
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:33,660
We are not; because you cannot put yourself into a small

470
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:38,200
arena, saying, “I am a Sahaja yogi, but I am a Christian.”

471
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,160
You cannot.  You haveto give up that margin.

472
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,620
You are a Sahaja yogi out and out,

473
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:51,200
and all the other nonsensical things are not belonging to you.

474
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,910
I have seen many Muslims also come to Sahaja Yoga,

475
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,750
but out of them very few are real Sahaja yogis.

476
00:43:02,870 --> 00:43:05,950
But they’ll come, listen to My lecture, this, that.

477
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:13,040
But very few are really Sahaja yogis in the real sense of the word.

478
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,120
Then you will start seeing the defects of your community

479
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:25,120
of so-called religion you belong to, whatever it is you will see.

480
00:43:25,790 --> 00:43:31,120
And you will definitely try to correct it,

481
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:33,160
if you love them

482
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:36,750
– or you give up.

483
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,160
These are special people, specially selected

484
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,000
for a very special cause,

485
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,620
and you cannot waste your energy on small, nonsensical things.

486
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,790
That is one thing you should know.

487
00:43:53,750 --> 00:43:56,040
On this Diwali day you have to know

488
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,700
that you have to burn yourself

489
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:07,040
for the light of the Divine to absolutely spread all over.

490
00:44:09,870 --> 00:44:12,160
But don’t do it too much.

491
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,830
Like some people came and told Me,

492
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:17,790
“Mother, we have given up our parents,

493
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,120
we have given up this,  we have given up that.

494
00:44:20,790 --> 00:44:22,790
Still we are not good.”

495
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,870
So I said, “Why should you give up?

496
00:44:26,660 --> 00:44:29,870
You are catching onto something, then you are giving up?

497
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:33,540
Or automatically it’s just finished?”

498
00:44:33,950 --> 00:44:39,000
“Ah, we were, you see, very much attached to our family, parents,

499
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:44,870
country, this, that, and now we have given up some – but some.”

500
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,500
Such half-baked people are no good,

501
00:44:50,870 --> 00:44:53,620
and don’t pay too much attention to them.

502
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,870
They don’t deserve any attention.

503
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:02,700
That is very much to be understood,

504
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:05,700
that you should not be also like that,

505
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,910
nor you should have friends like that,.

506
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,120
nor you should make them Sahaja yogis

507
00:45:12,950 --> 00:45:16,620
Sahaja yogi is a special character

508
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:20,580
of a soldier who fights for the truth.

509
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:29,080
That kind of a personality when you will have,

510
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:33,750
there will be lights all over.

511
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:41,750
This Diwali day I bless you all from My heart,

512
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:46,620
and I want you to respect yourself

513
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,620
and understand what is the position of

514
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:54,540
your being in this

515
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:03,040
organization,  we can call, or in this movement of Sahaja Yoga.

516
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,950
And how are we working it out?

517
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,750
The attention should move from

518
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:14,950
all this nonsensical, mundane things to yourself.

519
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:20,580
It should be a very dynamic force that should work out.

520
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:26,700
And I’m sure next year it would be very different.

521
00:46:27,910 --> 00:46:33,750
We’ll have all the beautiful blessings of the Divine.

522
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,660
We must do it collectively, understandingly.

523
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,830
May God bless you.
