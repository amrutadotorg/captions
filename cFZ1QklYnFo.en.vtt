Shri Krishna Puja Talk
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:02.754
August 16, 1998

00:00:05.436 --> 00:00:10.648
Today we are going to have 
Shri Krishna Puja.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:24.260
It is a very important thing
about the power of Shri Krishna

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.417
that gives you a witness state.

00:00:33.148 --> 00:00:36.958
This is very important also because,

00:00:38.227 --> 00:00:50.685
in these days of Kali Yuga 
and complete confusion of value system,

00:00:51.161 --> 00:01:03.512
all kinds of turmoil makes 
a very complex conditions to exist.

00:01:08.952 --> 00:01:19.452
The state of witnessing is only
possible through meditation:

00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:24.060
you reach the state 
of thoughtless awareness.

00:01:24.632 --> 00:01:27.089
It’s combined together.

00:01:28.423 --> 00:01:36.104
Now the witness state is such a state 
where you just do not react.

00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:45.103
If you react, then the problem starts.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.175
It’s a very simple thing to understand

00:01:54.643 --> 00:02:02.785
that we react through our ego 
or through our conditioning.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:14.475
Otherwise there is no way to react.

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.929
Anything, now for example
there is a beautiful carpet here.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:29.389
As soon as I look at it, 
if I use My ego I’ll start thinking,

00:02:29.444 --> 00:02:31.977
“Now from where did they get it?

00:02:33.286 --> 00:02:35.529
How much they paid it?”

00:02:41.082 --> 00:02:43.404
This is the first reaction.

00:02:44.376 --> 00:02:48.894
Then you can even go further with it, 
anger can come in,

00:02:48.987 --> 00:02:51.590
“Why did they bring such a nice carpet?

00:02:52.521 --> 00:02:55.312
What was the need to put it here?”

00:02:55.995 --> 00:02:59.280
It goes on like that, one after another.

00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:06.538
Now in My conditioning 
if I see these things, I would say

00:03:06.612 --> 00:03:10.453
that “This color is not suited 
for Krishna Puja,

00:03:11.643 --> 00:03:18.081
they should have had another color 
for this Krishna Puja.”

00:03:18.672 --> 00:03:23.737
So this kind goes on 
from one to another, to another.

00:03:24.522 --> 00:03:28.749
But that means this conditioning 
is built up within us.

00:03:30.511 --> 00:03:37.795
All our problems of our conditioning 
are really horrible.

00:03:39.111 --> 00:03:42.218
For example, racialism.

00:03:43.527 --> 00:03:45.212
We have racialism.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:54.383
In America it’s very much more, 
you can feel it though they don’t say;

00:03:54.525 --> 00:04:02.631
but if you go, say, from Italy you feel it,

00:04:02.814 --> 00:04:05.567
if you go from India 
also you can feel it.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.765
Now why this racialism is there?

00:04:10.274 --> 00:04:12.133
What is the reason?

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.681
Why do we react

00:04:16.791 --> 00:04:30.002
to this kind of horrible hatred 
for another community or another color

00:04:30.216 --> 00:04:32.944
which is only skin-deep?

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.038
Now with rationality 
you might be able to explain,

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.846
“O God, these people, 
they are absolutely useless,”

00:04:46.143 --> 00:04:54.135
or “They have come to our country 
and are just troubling us.”

00:04:54.184 --> 00:04:57.112
All these conditionings are there.

00:04:57.137 --> 00:05:02.482
But if you see when 
they talk of immigrants,

00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:07.085
the Americans must know 
they are immigrants, all of them.

00:05:07.164 --> 00:05:10.381
America never was their country.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.776
And they threw away 
all the other Red Indians,

00:05:14.974 --> 00:05:20.115
took away their land and very nicely 
they are governors of America.

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:28.675
But the reaction is, 
“Those who are not white complexion,

00:05:28.778 --> 00:05:32.990
they are all to be condemned, tortured.”

00:05:33.494 --> 00:05:42.185
Now if they are by nature violent, then
also this conditioning of violence comes in.

00:05:43.174 --> 00:05:45.810
Then they start killing each other.

00:05:47.395 --> 00:05:56.385
They have killed ruthlessly so many people,
thinking that they have a right

00:05:56.633 --> 00:06:06.906
to go into any country and kill everyone 
and take the land that is not their own.

00:06:07.136 --> 00:06:11.041
Actually, land doesn’t belong to anybody
as such.

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:14.897
But nobody has a right to go to some land

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.152
and try to occupy it, 
and throw away the people

00:06:19.221 --> 00:06:22.080
who do not belong to that country.

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:29.363
Yesterday was
the Independence Day of India,

00:06:29.499 --> 00:06:36.506
and I have seen the flag going up, 
our national flag,

00:06:36.561 --> 00:06:45.235
and the British flag going down.

00:06:46.273 --> 00:06:50.398
All that has happened 
after so much of struggle,

00:06:50.423 --> 00:06:53.764
so much of sufferings of the people,

00:06:55.211 --> 00:07:04.411
because they came to India, 
landed nicely there and became the masters.

00:07:05.109 --> 00:07:13.239
So this is also a kind of a conditioning
that comes in a collective way,

00:07:13.353 --> 00:07:17.678
that you go into anybody’s country,

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:21.768
throw away the people from there 
or sort of occupy that place,

00:07:21.793 --> 00:07:24.263
and become the masters.

00:07:24.422 --> 00:07:30.319
It’s like going into somebody’s house
that belongs to somebody,

00:07:30.453 --> 00:07:32.935
and throw away the people who are inside

00:07:33.039 --> 00:07:38.221
and nicely settle there as 
the owners and the masters,

00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:45.588
because they have better intelligence,
perhaps the cunning more in them.

00:07:46.207 --> 00:07:54.511
With that cunning, if the white people
think they can rule the black people,

00:07:56.992 --> 00:08:03.422
is not where you can develop 
a witness state.

00:08:31.962 --> 00:08:37.122
So this kind of conditioning 
is like a plague

00:08:37.577 --> 00:08:41.208
and moves from one country 
to another country,

00:08:41.299 --> 00:08:47.021
where some people think they are superior
and make people look inferior.

00:08:47.069 --> 00:08:51.942
And the people also are there 
who accept this kind of a situation,

00:08:52.053 --> 00:09:00.479
accept this kind of a position, 
where they are supposed to be equal.

00:09:01.424 --> 00:09:03.766
I would say take the example of America,

00:09:03.813 --> 00:09:08.241
because this has been celebrated 
by Americans

00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:14.946
and because Krishna is the Ruler, 
Krishna is the Ruler of America.

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:21.665
He Himself was a dark person, 
Himself was on the black side.

00:09:22.601 --> 00:09:27.578
And in the same country where He rules,

00:09:27.696 --> 00:09:34.197
the another great thing is 
that they don’t realize

00:09:34.324 --> 00:09:43.724
that if all the black or the Asians 
get out of that country now,

00:09:44.088 --> 00:09:46.449
I don’t know what will happen to them.

00:09:46.552 --> 00:09:51.793
All their sports are managed by the blacks.

00:09:51.967 --> 00:09:58.420
If you want to see any American sport, 
ninety-nine per cent are black people.

00:09:59.881 --> 00:10:03.856
Then if you want to also see the music,

00:10:04.174 --> 00:10:09.525
because these black people, 
though they have black color -

00:10:09.644 --> 00:10:14.554
which is all right: as you have white,
they have black color -

00:10:15.602 --> 00:10:20.735
but they have a voice which 
the white people don’t have.

00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:28.025
They can sing so well that 
no white people can compete with them.

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:32.099
It’s a full justice done to the color.

00:10:34.416 --> 00:10:43.887
Now if you take out the Asians, all doctors,
all nurses, all architects, all accountants,

00:10:44.235 --> 00:10:46.609
all of them will disappear.

00:10:47.371 --> 00:10:49.455
Now what will remain?

00:10:52.336 --> 00:11:01.188
You have to understand that it is color 
which is nothing to do, nothing to do

00:11:01.347 --> 00:11:09.595
with your intelligence, with your 
value system, with your Spirit.

00:11:10.881 --> 00:11:15.389
We are here to achieve our spirituality.

00:11:15.817 --> 00:11:24.737
The Spirit doesn’t understand color 
because it is so superficial,

00:11:24.975 --> 00:11:32.538
and it is so very cruel to condemn 
someone for the color.

00:11:33.903 --> 00:11:38.059
Same now is happening as the reaction.

00:11:38.242 --> 00:11:41.749
Every action has a reaction.

00:11:42.313 --> 00:11:49.118
So what happens is that you find the blacks
are reacting.

00:11:50.182 --> 00:11:55.636
They are reacting, and their reaction 
can be very dangerous.

00:11:56.938 --> 00:12:08.123
Every day I read their reactions are coming
up so badly; not in America but all over,

00:12:08.281 --> 00:12:13.404
they are now thinking they must rise 
and oppose this domination.

00:12:14.031 --> 00:12:20.463
But in their own country where
they have people of different colors,

00:12:21.714 --> 00:12:28.180
ilttle variation I think, they are all
black people but little variation maybe,

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:36.271
so they form groups and they start 
cutting each other’s throats.

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:41.555
I’ve seen on the television 
how ruthlessly they kill.

00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.580
I don’t know what is 
the difference of color is,

00:12:45.692 --> 00:12:48.865
but somehow they have formed groups and

00:12:48.951 --> 00:12:54.408
this group will go and kill that, 
and that group will come and kill.

00:12:54.503 --> 00:12:59.196
It’s not like Kaurava and Pandava.

00:12:59.506 --> 00:13:03.520
It’s not two types of people absolutely
opposite,

00:13:03.623 --> 00:13:08.417
it’s not that the negative and
the positive is there, it’s not.

00:13:08.496 --> 00:13:12.878
They are all negative, 
whether they are white or black,

00:13:13.029 --> 00:13:17.568
and they start quarreling 
and fightingwith each other.

00:13:18.663 --> 00:13:22.305
Now this violence is growing so much.

00:13:22.488 --> 00:13:28.515
I think violence is the only weapon 
they use now to express themselves.

00:13:28.658 --> 00:13:37.426
You see here something happens, so
somewhere there you find they explode bombs

00:13:38.429 --> 00:13:41.553
and kill so many innocent people.

00:13:42.053 --> 00:13:45.740
It’s very, very sinful to do like that.

00:13:46.272 --> 00:13:52.256
Even the slightest violence is sinful, 
and this kind of a violence,

00:13:52.336 --> 00:14:00.937
in the eyes of Shri Krishna, are
absolutely to be punished very well.

00:14:03.635 --> 00:14:06.736
Now this comes through ego.

00:14:07.101 --> 00:14:13.851
You think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill,

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:15.677
or something like that.

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:19.843
A funny idea into human mind comes in,

00:14:19.891 --> 00:14:25.367
and you decide that you have 
a right to kill another person.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:33.580
Or one may say this comes from hatred, but
hatred is an outcome of ego.

00:14:33.715 --> 00:14:38.961
When the ego starts acting, 
it collects all these things

00:14:39.062 --> 00:14:47.562
like hatred, also possessiveness, 
anger, violence,

00:14:47.672 --> 00:14:54.230
all these starts coming out of the ego, 
which actually blinds the person.

00:14:54.468 --> 00:14:59.755
You become blind to the fact that
there is no need to have violence,

00:14:59.811 --> 00:15:07.855
no need to hate someone, no need to kill
anyone because of this ego that is there.

00:15:08.970 --> 00:15:13.731
Now one may say, “Mother, how does 
this ego build up in a people?”

00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:23.009
Of course, mostly it is due to reactions,
also it is due to the conditioning.

00:15:23.208 --> 00:15:29.894
If the child is told from the childhood
that “You should hate these people,

00:15:30.012 --> 00:15:31.656
they are to be hated.

00:15:31.807 --> 00:15:35.256
They are wrong people, 
they are bad people,”

00:15:35.281 --> 00:15:37.875
they just start doing that.

00:15:38.383 --> 00:15:45.411
When they grow up they start showing 
that hatred is now like a cactus

00:15:45.495 --> 00:15:49.948
growing very big, and is killing others.

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:58.542
There’s no justification for this
kind of a behavior by human beings.

00:15:58.844 --> 00:16:03.294
If they are human beings 
they have to have human qualities,

00:16:03.373 --> 00:16:14.935
and that is what is possible only if you
learn how to just witness and not to react.

00:16:15.919 --> 00:16:22.048
For example you see two cocks are fighting.

00:16:23.024 --> 00:16:25.305
You enjoy that.

00:16:25.381 --> 00:16:28.165
Two cocks are fighting, 
people are enjoying.

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:31.559
One cock dies, they are very happy,

00:16:31.654 --> 00:16:36.686
as if the one which died had killed
his parents or did something like that.

00:16:36.900 --> 00:16:38.322
Very surprising!

00:16:38.353 --> 00:16:43.103
Now in Spain even now there are 
these bull-fights going on.

00:16:43.329 --> 00:16:46.348
Every year six bull-fights, every year,

00:16:46.451 --> 00:16:55.235
and the hall contains more than ten times
more than we have here, and is always full.

00:16:55.688 --> 00:17:00.108
And now the women have taken 
to fight the bulls.

00:17:00.267 --> 00:17:02.240
Now if the bull is not killed,

00:17:02.289 --> 00:17:05.717
they allow the bulls to go on the street 
and kill people.

00:17:05.801 --> 00:17:19.265
This kind of a violent enjoyment is still
lingering into the minds of the people.

00:17:20.122 --> 00:17:28.448
It is so sad to see people 
who are now talking of humanity,

00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:36.614
talking of peace, talking of joy, 
are still enjoying these violent acts.

00:17:38.215 --> 00:17:43.343
Either they are doing 
or they want to watch.

00:17:43.413 --> 00:17:46.865
So then you go to these films and things

00:17:46.973 --> 00:17:52.885
that have been created of a horrible 
violence, and people enjoy it,

00:17:53.092 --> 00:17:57.129
enjoy such films, 
and such films are again created.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:01.668
Now if you really become a witness state,

00:18:01.866 --> 00:18:05.199
if you are in a witness state, 
then what will happen?

00:18:05.691 --> 00:18:13.584
If you watch any such things 
that are happening, it will subside.

00:18:13.823 --> 00:18:18.937
If you are in a witness state 
and if that level,

00:18:19.064 --> 00:18:25.632
then no accident 
will take place in your sight.

00:18:26.219 --> 00:18:28.902
Even if there is an accident,

00:18:28.965 --> 00:18:35.733
 then you can save the person, 
you can help the person very actively.

00:18:35.859 --> 00:18:40.539
That’s in a very small scale, 
but even in a very large scale

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:44.260
you can do it, something wonderful.

00:18:44.285 --> 00:18:48.595
I remember I was not very old at that time,

00:18:48.698 --> 00:18:53.737
but we were living in a house 
very close to the Secretariat,

00:18:53.928 --> 00:18:56.650
where they had a strike.

00:18:56.681 --> 00:19:02.237
And they were asking for 
a separate Maharashtra or something.

00:19:02.277 --> 00:19:04.534
So the police was standing there

00:19:04.590 --> 00:19:08.780
and by the order of the Chief Minister

00:19:08.843 --> 00:19:12.788
they were shooting at everyone 
who was coming,

00:19:12.986 --> 00:19:16.843
anyone who passed through that road 
they were shooting,

00:19:16.892 --> 00:19:20.233
they were enjoying 
their shooting game, all of them.

00:19:20.431 --> 00:19:23.556
I saw all this and I just couldn’t bear it.

00:19:23.635 --> 00:19:28.484
I just went down, went down 
and asked the police to stop it.

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.443
They stopped, you’d be amazed, 
they stopped.

00:19:31.538 --> 00:19:36.086
Then I carried those people 
who were wounded up in My house,

00:19:36.252 --> 00:19:40.855
took out their bullets and all that, 
called the ambulance and saved them.

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.392
But for that one thing was there:

00:19:43.471 --> 00:19:48.344
I was in a state of witnessing, 
so you become fearless.

00:19:48.392 --> 00:19:57.647
There is no fear at all, once you learn 
how to have the state of witnessing.

00:19:57.703 --> 00:20:04.380
Because when you are not witnessing you get
disturbed, you get upset, you get excited,

00:20:04.411 --> 00:20:07.602
you may join also 
these wrong type of people.

00:20:07.665 --> 00:20:15.207
But if you are in a state of witnessing, 
that itself is a power.

00:20:15.318 --> 00:20:25.108
And that witnessing state helps you to win
over so many difficulties of other people.

00:20:25.204 --> 00:20:31.934
There’s this Chinese story about a saint.

00:20:32.021 --> 00:20:35.861
So one king brought his cock to him 
and said,

00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:41.148
“You train my cock in such a way 
that he should win.”

00:20:41.221 --> 00:20:42.720
He said, “All right.”

00:20:42.767 --> 00:20:47.154
So he kept the cock of the king 
for one month

00:20:47.210 --> 00:20:56.173
and when the show started, different
cocks came from different places

00:20:56.244 --> 00:20:59.017
and they all started fighting.

00:20:59.350 --> 00:21:05.469
This cock just stood up and was watching, 
just watching.

00:21:05.644 --> 00:21:08.401
And other cocks got such a fright,

00:21:08.584 --> 00:21:11.544
they couldn’t understand 
how this fellow is not disturbed,

00:21:11.607 --> 00:21:14.749
he’s just watching, he’s standing, 
he’s doing nothing.

00:21:14.841 --> 00:21:21.357
So all they disappeared from the arena and
he was declared as the successful one.

00:21:21.486 --> 00:21:25.832
So this is the best way 
to bring non-violence.

00:21:25.943 --> 00:21:31.526
In violent places you go 
and stand steadily there,

00:21:31.852 --> 00:21:35.757
facing all the things that are happening,

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:44.792
and that witness state acts, acts and stops
that kind of a violence that is going on.

00:21:50.768 --> 00:21:59.318
But witness state is not a mental state, 
it is a state of a spiritual ascent

00:21:59.381 --> 00:22:02.243
where you become a witness.

00:22:03.191 --> 00:22:09.099
Best way to practice witness state 
is not to criticize anyone,

00:22:10.361 --> 00:22:12.147
not to criticize.

00:22:12.217 --> 00:22:16.769
I’ve seen people who are 
all the time criticizing others.

00:22:16.834 --> 00:22:21.077
They cannot criticize themselves, 
so they start criticizing other.

00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:25.806
So much so that they don’t even see 
what’s wrong with them.

00:22:25.871 --> 00:22:29.687
They don’t even see what wrong 
they have done to others,

00:22:29.743 --> 00:22:33.508
because they think they have 
a right to criticize others,

00:22:33.596 --> 00:22:37.349
and they enjoy this criticism very well.

00:22:37.500 --> 00:22:41.347
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

00:22:41.442 --> 00:22:45.037
You just watch and see for yourself.

00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:47.021
That’s all is your right.

00:22:47.139 --> 00:22:51.717
You have no right to criticize 
anyone or anything.

00:22:51.781 --> 00:22:54.567
But some people think 
if you do not criticize,

00:22:54.678 --> 00:22:59.718
then it will go on like this and 
it will never stop. It’s not that!

00:22:59.930 --> 00:23:05.072
Once you watch the thing yourself, 
only just watch.

00:23:05.128 --> 00:23:11.476
Your attention itself is enlightened now,
with that enlightened attention

00:23:11.539 --> 00:23:17.247
you can just watch and stop 
the nonsense that is there.

00:23:17.341 --> 00:23:21.511
But we are always conscious 
that we are something great,

00:23:21.567 --> 00:23:24.964
and we have to do this 
and we have to do that.

00:23:26.045 --> 00:23:34.575
Under these circumstances what happens 
is that you become another problem.

00:23:35.533 --> 00:23:38.191
Because what can you do?

00:23:38.398 --> 00:23:40.749
You can’t do anything.

00:23:41.011 --> 00:23:44.135
But what you can do is to watch.

00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:51.170
By watching and by just 
seeing things as they are,

00:23:51.225 --> 00:23:57.289
you really develop a very different 
state of being.

00:23:57.368 --> 00:24:03.653
Firstly all such people 
who are just witnessing,

00:24:06.119 --> 00:24:09.080
what happens to them is very interesting,

00:24:09.143 --> 00:24:12.155
that their memory loss is much less,

00:24:12.204 --> 00:24:16.132
because whatever they see becomes 
like a picture to them.

00:24:16.198 --> 00:24:22.010
Like you can say, they can tell you even
the color, the folding, everything.

00:24:22.066 --> 00:24:26.956
Whatever they see is so much 
in their mind like a photo,

00:24:27.052 --> 00:24:30.956
and they can tell you
exactly what they have seen,

00:24:31.028 --> 00:24:37.567
and your memory is not lost.

00:24:37.658 --> 00:24:45.192
While if you react onto everything, 
your memory becomes horrible.

00:24:45.259 --> 00:24:49.737
And people are 
so much habituated with reacting.

00:24:49.835 --> 00:24:55.747
Like I know of one gentleman, 
he had a habit of reacting,

00:24:56.017 --> 00:24:58.144
and I was going with him in the car.

00:24:58.205 --> 00:25:09.238
So he was reading every advertisement, 
every name of every shop,

00:25:09.432 --> 00:25:11.992
every person, everything.

00:25:12.111 --> 00:25:16.070
He was just telling, “Who is that? 
What is that?” - this, that.

00:25:16.729 --> 00:25:21.030
I was wondering, “Look at this gentleman,
he’s talking so much,

00:25:21.123 --> 00:25:22.901
what will happen to him?”

00:25:22.997 --> 00:25:29.825
But ultimately I’ve found that all such
people who are all the time reacting

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:35.595
become, actually they have, I think,
senile decay or maybe they become

00:25:35.721 --> 00:25:38.118
forgetful, very forgetful.

00:25:39.450 --> 00:25:42.877
But this is not the only loss we have.

00:25:42.973 --> 00:25:48.175
With this kind of people, when
they are formed into a collective

00:25:48.239 --> 00:25:51.278
they can be very dangerous people

00:25:51.554 --> 00:25:55.737
because with that kind of a nature
they have to do something.

00:25:56.205 --> 00:26:02.609
They must do something because, after all,
they are combined together for a purpose

00:26:02.657 --> 00:26:08.073
 or, we can say, for some reactions 
which all of them have built up.

00:26:08.708 --> 00:26:12.898
In small things, in big things, 
you’ll find people do like that.

00:26:12.962 --> 00:26:20.790
And some people who are very much, very
much developed in this kind of behavior

00:26:20.861 --> 00:26:26.001
can collect lots of people, 
and do any amount of harm to others.

00:26:26.224 --> 00:26:29.327
I would look at the picture of Hitler.

00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:35.301
For nine years this fellow was watching 
what wrongs Jews are doing.

00:26:35.610 --> 00:26:43.983
He wouldn’t watch what Germans are doing,
what wrong they are doing to the society.

00:26:44.261 --> 00:26:47.820
And that time the society
also was very bad, because

00:26:47.892 --> 00:26:50.900
they were having 
all kinds of licentiousness.

00:26:51.052 --> 00:26:53.973
Now he was noting down,

00:26:54.576 --> 00:26:58.306
“These Jews are like this, 
they do this, they take money, they -

00:26:58.362 --> 00:27:02.909
lending money,” all kinds of things
he got into his head.

00:27:03.116 --> 00:27:08.298
As a result of that he
built up a reaction into him

00:27:08.405 --> 00:27:15.414
that “We must somehow or another see
that these people go away from Germany.”

00:27:15.517 --> 00:27:20.798
But then he thought, “Even if they go
away from Germany, they’ll prosper again.

00:27:20.902 --> 00:27:23.013
So why not kill them?”

00:27:23.052 --> 00:27:28.883
I mean, to such an extent that even,
you know, you cannot see such films,

00:27:28.954 --> 00:27:34.550
you cannot see anything 
of that nature that Hitler did.

00:27:34.613 --> 00:27:41.815
But he did it, and people who followed him
also did it without feeling any hitch,

00:27:41.927 --> 00:27:49.391
as as if it was a matter of great pleasure 
or a joy, or maybe it’s a duty.

00:27:49.503 --> 00:27:53.620
How could they get duty bound 
to such a horrible thing

00:27:53.707 --> 00:27:57.181
like killing thousands 
and thousands of Jews?

00:27:58.731 --> 00:28:03.205
What Jews had done to them, 
they could have corrected it.

00:28:03.263 --> 00:28:06.284
But why did they indulge 
into such violence?

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:10.632
And they wanted to finish 
all the Jews of the world.

00:28:11.021 --> 00:28:13.410
It can be very, very dangerous,

00:28:13.482 --> 00:28:17.863
because once you start losing 
your witness state

00:28:17.966 --> 00:28:22.364
you can fall into negative collectivity.

00:28:22.396 --> 00:28:26.836
And thus this negative collectivity acts,

00:28:26.924 --> 00:28:31.797
acts in such a bad manner that 
all the conflicts of the world,

00:28:31.884 --> 00:28:37.508
all the problems of the world
perhaps are related with this.

00:28:37.850 --> 00:28:41.515
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

00:28:50.177 --> 00:28:52.688
We should not react,

00:28:55.815 --> 00:28:58.109
we should not react.

00:28:59.386 --> 00:29:08.272
If you see something wrong, all right,
you meditate on that point, you meditate.

00:29:08.756 --> 00:29:16.694
If you find anything wrong happening, 
all right, meditate on that.

00:29:17.559 --> 00:29:23.034
If somebody is unkind to you,
at that moment do not react.

00:29:23.082 --> 00:29:30.549
Afterwards when that person is quietened,
you tell him or tell her,

00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:36.433
because at that time when he’s
so volatile or she’s volatile if you tell,

00:29:36.504 --> 00:29:38.695
nothing will happen.

00:29:38.956 --> 00:29:43.863
Gradually, I don’t say always 
you can win over such people,

00:29:43.927 --> 00:29:50.214
but gradually you may be able 
to make them understand that it’s wrong,

00:29:50.325 --> 00:29:56.071
it’s wrong to do things which 
they have been doing.

00:29:56.450 --> 00:29:59.529
In a way, you see, the reaction

00:29:59.624 --> 00:30:06.574
to anything which is stupid also 
can be very self-destroying.

00:30:07.710 --> 00:30:10.230
Like some people have built-in reactions,

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.151
like you have seen this 
Mr. Clinton behaving.

00:30:13.238 --> 00:30:15.432
I mean, you can’t understand a man

00:30:15.519 --> 00:30:20.209
of his stature, of his level 
should have such reactions,

00:30:20.289 --> 00:30:24.344
but must be from his childhood 
or I don’t know how he built it up.

00:30:24.415 --> 00:30:29.190
Now he is in trouble, and very shameful.

00:30:30.341 --> 00:30:41.535
This also is, I think perhaps comes from
a very great indulgence into reactions.

00:30:42.749 --> 00:30:49.804
Why should you react to a woman,
I can’t understand, or to a man?

00:30:49.971 --> 00:30:52.646
And this is one of the biggest problems

00:30:52.773 --> 00:30:57.773
of today’s culture, specially i
n all the developed countries,

00:30:57.868 --> 00:31:02.518
that all the time men are looking
at women, women are looking at men.

00:31:03.035 --> 00:31:04.955
For what?

00:31:05.222 --> 00:31:10.841
Perhaps they look at women because they want
to see how many women are looking at them.

00:31:10.992 --> 00:31:16.815
Or they look at men perhaps may be
that how many men are looking at them.

00:31:17.199 --> 00:31:20.058
Why, why is this happening?

00:31:20.232 --> 00:31:24.271
Because they have some 
inferiority complex in them,

00:31:24.446 --> 00:31:28.641
or that they want to attract 
the attention of everyone.

00:31:28.696 --> 00:31:33.339
I mean, horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others,

00:31:33.404 --> 00:31:35.220
to get the sympathy of others.

00:31:35.363 --> 00:31:41.139
I mean, if you see the level of your
awareness where it goes, you’ll be amazed.

00:31:41.219 --> 00:31:47.722
Like they say one lady killed her eight
children just to get sympathy from others.

00:31:48.286 --> 00:31:53.196
But think of such horrible things 
people are doing.

00:31:54.061 --> 00:32:03.302
Now if you want others 
to have reaction you do this,

00:32:05.008 --> 00:32:11.093
that they want others to see you
or to react to ...

00:32:13.958 --> 00:32:17.325
I don’t know, to give
you importance, you can say.

00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.156
But what is the use of such 
an empty importance?

00:32:22.775 --> 00:32:28.770
But people are seeking, and is 
a very common disease of modern life:

00:32:28.903 --> 00:32:35.533
all the time how you should look, how
you should appear, how you should walk.

00:32:35.581 --> 00:32:42.667
Everything is so stupid 
and wastage of energy.

00:32:43.627 --> 00:32:49.617
God has created human beings 
very, very different,

00:32:49.744 --> 00:32:53.820
none of them are copies, 
none of them.

00:32:53.947 --> 00:33:01.868
Even in the nature you find 
the leaves of trees, they are so unique,

00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:05.289
you cannot match them with another leaf.

00:33:06.249 --> 00:33:12.395
So that’s how human beings 
are created, differently.

00:33:12.514 --> 00:33:14.825
They are made like that.

00:33:15.229 --> 00:33:17.054
One has to accept.

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:20.099
Whatever you are, it’s all right.

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:23.386
Why do you want to look 
like another person?

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:28.182
This kind of reaction is 
extremely stupid, I think,

00:33:28.207 --> 00:33:36.666
that we are spoiling our energy and life 
for something absolutely worthless.

00:33:37.087 --> 00:33:40.746
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, 
your worth is great.

00:33:40.865 --> 00:33:48.063
You have come here to emancipate 
human beings from these silly ideas

00:33:48.126 --> 00:33:54.023
and foolish ways, 
the way people are behaving.

00:33:55.761 --> 00:34:02.604
I don’t know whom to blame, but suddenly
our attention has become very diversified,

00:34:02.762 --> 00:34:07.644
our reactions have become very, very funny.

00:34:07.683 --> 00:34:11.413
One doesn’t know 
why people react like that,

00:34:11.453 --> 00:34:15.868
and then why do we worry 
about what people react?

00:34:17.725 --> 00:34:24.742
All these things are not only on individual
level, but also on a collective level.

00:34:25.234 --> 00:34:32.337
As a result, you see, new kinds 
of value system has been created.

00:34:32.686 --> 00:34:40.335
Now for a mother, say for example, she’ll
boast of how many men are running after her.

00:34:40.851 --> 00:34:45.768
Or she would think she is a great actress:
I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:34:45.879 --> 00:34:50.641
And the way they talk about themselves 
is something surprising.

00:34:50.728 --> 00:34:57.421
If she’s a mother, she has to be a good
mother and she has to look like a mother.

00:34:57.516 --> 00:35:04.254
But they are so much engrossed

00:35:04.318 --> 00:35:13.688
or they are so much standing on the basis
that they have to be extremely attractive,

00:35:13.761 --> 00:35:24.166
they have to be the queens or I don’t know
what, what a position they want to have.

00:35:24.231 --> 00:35:26.451
Same with the men.

00:35:26.785 --> 00:35:35.321
You see, if you have something within you,
if there is any quality within you,

00:35:35.725 --> 00:35:43.171
is there anything that can qualify you 
as a great man, it will be showing.

00:35:43.228 --> 00:35:49.229
You don’t have to advertise, you don’t have
to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing.

00:35:50.839 --> 00:35:56.539
So that indifference if you have 
towards the public opinion,

00:35:56.635 --> 00:36:00.707
I think you can achieve a lot.

00:36:01.151 --> 00:36:05.273
Most of the frustrations will disappear.

00:36:06.098 --> 00:36:10.865
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen 
people want to show off a lot.

00:36:12.142 --> 00:36:14.502
I know who does that.

00:36:14.948 --> 00:36:20.843
But they should know, 
once you do not react to outside

00:36:20.875 --> 00:36:26.239
you start reacting to inside, 
and introspection will start properly.

00:36:29.216 --> 00:36:43.740
When you see yourself you’ll be amazed
how admiring you are, how happy you are.

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:51.107
Now if you go beyond that a little more,
then you don’t think of all these things.

00:36:52.837 --> 00:37:03.125
You just become thoughtless and you
just stand up as a person who is respected,

00:37:03.482 --> 00:37:10.554
whose company is wanted, 
who is loved and who is cared for.

00:37:12.786 --> 00:37:16.468
So one should not worry as 
to what people react,

00:37:16.595 --> 00:37:20.248
what they say about you, 
what they think about you.

00:37:20.931 --> 00:37:25.041
You should just introspect 
and see for yourself.

00:37:25.393 --> 00:37:29.732
After some time 
you don’t need even introspection.

00:37:39.104 --> 00:37:44.036
It is a kind of a state I am talking about,

00:37:44.481 --> 00:37:50.918
where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that 
“I will not fight.

00:37:53.133 --> 00:38:05.187
So in between Me and the army, 
My army, you have to select.”

00:38:05.987 --> 00:38:12.948
So Kauravas said, 
“No, we’ll take Your army, Your army.

00:38:13.091 --> 00:38:18.654
You give us Your army and we’ll strengthen
our army.”

00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:25.501
But Arjuna said, 
“I don’t want army, I want You.

00:38:26.654 --> 00:38:28.665
You don’t want to fight, it’s all right.”

00:38:28.779 --> 00:38:33.668
Because though He will be there 
in a witness state only,

00:38:34.224 --> 00:38:40.650
He won’t be fighting 
but His power will act.

00:38:41.635 --> 00:38:46.111
He doesn’t have to fight, 
He doesn’t have to do anything,

00:38:46.174 --> 00:38:54.005
but His own power which is outwardly 
is silent but will act,

00:38:54.077 --> 00:38:57.545
and that is how we will win the war.

00:38:58.954 --> 00:39:04.107
So this power of witnessing 
you all should develop.

00:39:04.484 --> 00:39:12.476
Try to develop it that when 
you are reacting, stop reaction,

00:39:12.855 --> 00:39:16.227
stop reaction about everything.

00:39:17.625 --> 00:39:23.927
You will be amazed, you will find yourself 
a very, very powerful person

00:39:24.015 --> 00:39:28.244
in the sense you’ll have no ambitions,

00:39:28.847 --> 00:39:35.220
you’ll have no desires, you’ll have 
no special fondness or anything.

00:39:36.602 --> 00:39:40.321
But just you are witnessing the drama.

00:39:40.508 --> 00:39:43.088
It’s very interesting to witness also,

00:39:43.135 --> 00:39:49.329
because then you understand 
the humor behind everything,

00:39:49.416 --> 00:39:53.202
you understand the stupidity 
behind everything.

00:39:53.242 --> 00:40:04.528
You understand also how people have been 
so violent, and you just laugh at it;

00:40:04.994 --> 00:40:10.859
you don’t get upset, excited, nothing, 
just laugh at it.

00:40:11.258 --> 00:40:16.870
After some time you’ll be amazed, 
your witness state will increase,

00:40:16.957 --> 00:40:22.958
and when in the collective all of you 
have that witness state,

00:40:23.157 --> 00:40:27.443
you can do wonders without doing anything,

00:40:29.642 --> 00:40:33.373
without saying anything, without acting:

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:37.022
only your presence itself can work it out.

00:40:37.229 --> 00:40:41.855
I don’t say that it will have effect 
on everyone, no, can’t say;

00:40:42.204 --> 00:40:44.554
but most of the people.

00:40:46.253 --> 00:40:53.110
Any person who is in that state,

00:40:53.292 --> 00:40:57.965
he is the one who brings peace,
he brings joy.

00:40:58.037 --> 00:41:06.970
I’ll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi who
was going to another island

00:41:07.129 --> 00:41:11.735
- he was livingin an island - 
for Sahaja Yoga work,

00:41:11.783 --> 00:41:19.942
and he found the whole sky was covered
with very black clouds, thundering clouds.

00:41:20.219 --> 00:41:23.523
So he just looked at them like this

00:41:25.126 --> 00:41:31.971
and he said, “Wait till I come back. 
I am going to do Mother’s work.”

00:41:32.741 --> 00:41:39.485
He went to another island, he did
the program, everything happened

00:41:39.536 --> 00:41:41.941
and when he came back

00:41:42.932 --> 00:41:50.875
he wanted to sleep, and suddenly
it started raining and thundering.

00:41:51.930 --> 00:41:54.630
Even the nature understands.

00:41:55.383 --> 00:42:00.335
Nature understands that you are 
in that great state of witnessing.

00:42:01.560 --> 00:42:04.679
But if you are very ambitious -

00:42:04.758 --> 00:42:08.731
even in Sahaja Yoga I have known
people who are very ambitious,

00:42:09.258 --> 00:42:12.747
they want to become leaders, I don’t know
what else.

00:42:12.836 --> 00:42:15.843
Actually, it’s all a myth.

00:42:16.168 --> 00:42:20.522
All mythical things they want to get to,

00:42:20.618 --> 00:42:23.887
and worry their heads 
about mythical things.

00:42:23.948 --> 00:42:27.654
Once you learn how to witness 
you will know the myth,

00:42:27.723 --> 00:42:31.536
you will know the absurdity, 
you will know the maya.

00:42:33.375 --> 00:42:39.740
So to overcome the problems of personality

00:42:39.914 --> 00:42:45.592
the best thing is to witness, 
practice witnessing everything:

00:42:45.648 --> 00:42:48.941
before talking, practice witnessing,

00:42:49.077 --> 00:42:54.188
before giving any comments, 
just start witnessing.

00:42:54.833 --> 00:42:58.913
It’s a very, very satisfying attitude.

00:42:59.364 --> 00:43:10.630
In Shri Krishna’s life the greatest power
He was, a witnessing personality.

00:43:12.861 --> 00:43:18.269
Without doing anything, without
taking a sword in His hands,

00:43:19.092 --> 00:43:27.854
without talking about fighting,

00:43:28.583 --> 00:43:35.404
He is the One who has helped Pandavas 
to win the war.

00:43:35.492 --> 00:43:42.486
Not only, but through His “Gita” 
He has tried to tell us

00:43:42.565 --> 00:43:48.842
what we have to do to win 
the war over evil.

00:43:50.064 --> 00:43:55.356
Whole “Gita” is the witness state 
He’s described about.

00:43:55.475 --> 00:44:01.185
If you read it “Gita” now from this angle,
you’ll be amazed to find

00:44:01.225 --> 00:44:08.569
that everywhere He is like a witness 
describing everything, whatever He sees.

00:44:08.696 --> 00:44:15.592
And He will tell you how, 
how this witness state

00:44:15.671 --> 00:44:21.836
has helped Him to understand 
also human beings.

00:44:22.413 --> 00:44:29.465
He is a man who was, we should say, 
was not such a big businessman;

00:44:29.692 --> 00:44:34.891
because first He told you that 
how to become sthita pragnya.

00:44:35.002 --> 00:44:40.663
“Sthita pragnya” is the one 
who is in the witness state.

00:44:41.456 --> 00:44:45.750
If you see all these verses 
on sthita pragnya,

00:44:45.794 --> 00:44:48.580
is nothing but a person 
who is in a witness state:

00:44:48.689 --> 00:44:55.028
how he lives, how he is happy, 
how he looks at things.

00:44:55.053 --> 00:44:57.345
It’s interesting, very interesting.

00:44:58.437 --> 00:45:00.565
First He describes that,

00:45:00.717 --> 00:45:04.756
not like the sharp people 
who will describe first the bad things,

00:45:04.888 --> 00:45:07.309
but He starts with the best.

00:45:07.388 --> 00:45:16.305
Then He goes down to other things and tell
you that whatever are the three aspects.

00:45:17.582 --> 00:45:23.842
The first He talks about karma, 
and many people get stuck at that point,

00:45:23.937 --> 00:45:28.730
that “Whatever karmas we are doing, 
we’ll get the punyas out of it.”

00:45:30.607 --> 00:45:32.456
But He is not.

00:45:32.551 --> 00:45:34.504
He didn’t say that.

00:45:34.607 --> 00:45:38.310
If you know Him, then you will know 
He never meant that.

00:45:38.516 --> 00:45:43.994
What He says, that “Whatever karmas 
you have to do, you can do it,

00:45:44.050 --> 00:45:52.429
but leave the results to the Divine Power.”

00:45:55.049 --> 00:45:58.235
Results are from the Divine Power.

00:45:59.426 --> 00:46:03.283
Now may be that some people think that

00:46:03.386 --> 00:46:09.058
they have got money 
because they have done good karmas,

00:46:09.186 --> 00:46:13.263
and start doing all kinds of bad karmas
with that money.

00:46:15.617 --> 00:46:16.947
He didn’t say that.

00:46:17.078 --> 00:46:21.944
He said, “Leave the results 
to the Divine Power.”

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:27.123
Because Divine Power knows best 
what is for you.

00:46:27.615 --> 00:46:30.974
And so if you think 
you have done something good,

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:33.849
you have served somewhere to the poor,

00:46:33.874 --> 00:46:39.116
you have done something really good 
for the women or anything;

00:46:40.488 --> 00:46:49.501
the result of that, you leave it 
at the feet of the Divine Power

00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:54.234
- means that you don’t build up an ego

00:46:54.527 --> 00:46:56.954
for whatever you have done.

00:46:57.242 --> 00:47:02.092
Though very well He has written this, 
but to understand Him one should

00:47:02.208 --> 00:47:07.232
have again the witness state to see 
what He has written about karma.

00:47:09.082 --> 00:47:12.448
Then He has written about gnyana.

00:47:12.622 --> 00:47:16.343
Gnyana means “where you know.”

00:47:17.001 --> 00:47:20.697
But that doesn’t mean 
you go on reading books, never.

00:47:23.332 --> 00:47:28.460
Gnyana means to know what you are.

00:47:30.789 --> 00:47:37.297
That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi,

00:47:38.133 --> 00:47:46.218
by which you know so many things 
through vibrations.

00:47:47.865 --> 00:47:51.324
Gnyana doesn’t mean reading books.

00:47:51.419 --> 00:47:55.494
By reading books you become more ignorant.

00:47:55.574 --> 00:48:03.962
So gnyana means that 
you must know yourself.

00:48:04.288 --> 00:48:08.220
If you do not know yourself, 
you do not know anything.

00:48:08.379 --> 00:48:13.585
So it comes to, that you must get 
your Self Realization.

00:48:13.744 --> 00:48:16.113
You must know yourself.

00:48:16.208 --> 00:48:18.518
It’s the second thing He has said.

00:48:18.661 --> 00:48:21.470
Lastly, He talks about bhakti.

00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:24.237
Bhakti is devotion.

00:48:25.706 --> 00:48:31.113
That too is another trick of Shri Krishna,
the way He describes bhakti.

00:48:31.216 --> 00:48:36.875
Now you find people on the street, 
“Hare Rama, Hare Krishna” singing.

00:48:38.113 --> 00:48:44.163
In one word He is concluded: 
He says, “You must do ananya bhakti.”

00:48:45.123 --> 00:48:48.099
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

00:48:48.203 --> 00:48:53.260
That means when you have submerged 
yourself into the Divine,

00:48:53.506 --> 00:48:55.430
you are one with the Divine,

00:48:55.510 --> 00:49:01.066
then you should do bhakti, 
otherwise I do not accept.

00:49:02.044 --> 00:49:05.536
He says that “If you give Me

00:49:05.622 --> 00:49:13.272
some leaves or some fruits 
or some flowers, I will accept,

00:49:14.877 --> 00:49:18.346
I will accept,” but

00:49:19.083 --> 00:49:26.727
for Him the real bhakti is only possible 
when you become one with the Divine;

00:49:27.925 --> 00:49:31.246
otherwise it’s just a show.

00:49:31.897 --> 00:49:37.878
So the third bhakti part also comes after
Self Realization.

00:49:38.196 --> 00:49:45.266
Now in the bhakti you see there is no

00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.532
“what is the value is and 
how much you’ve paid for it

00:49:50.594 --> 00:49:54.054
and how you bought it”- it’s not important.

00:49:55.357 --> 00:50:03.386
For that, a great example is of Shri Rama
when He went in the jungles.

00:50:05.044 --> 00:50:12.315
There was a old lady from 
the schedules caste, means she was

00:50:12.434 --> 00:50:18.857
one of the Bhilini as they call it,
 these people live in the jungles.

00:50:19.146 --> 00:50:27.154
So she brought some berries
 and offered it to Shri Ram.

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:34.363
And she said that “I have tasted 
all of them and they are not sour,

00:50:34.618 --> 00:50:37.125
all of them I have tasted.”

00:50:37.395 --> 00:50:46.095
Now after tasting something in India,
people call it, is become not to be eaten.

00:50:46.174 --> 00:50:50.695
I mean, we cannot taste something
and give it to somebody else, it’s not done

00:50:50.785 --> 00:50:53.171
according to Indian culture.

00:50:53.258 --> 00:50:55.409
But Shri Rama took it.

00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:57.822
He took it and said, “What

00:50:58.005 --> 00:51:00.973
beautiful fruits! 
I’ve never eaten such fruits!”

00:51:04.143 --> 00:51:06.423
So Lakshmana got very angry.

00:51:06.517 --> 00:51:08.849
He said, “You stupid woman,

00:51:08.953 --> 00:51:12.826
you have eaten these fruits and 
that’s what you are giving to Shri Ram.

00:51:12.882 --> 00:51:14.813
Why did you do that?”

00:51:14.925 --> 00:51:23.223
So Sita was watching, so She asked Him “Why
don’t You give Me some of these fruits?”

00:51:23.475 --> 00:51:24.825
He gave.

00:51:25.374 --> 00:51:28.793
She said, “My God, what nice fruits these
are!

00:51:28.864 --> 00:51:31.499
I have never eaten such good fruits.”

00:51:31.579 --> 00:51:35.362
So then Lakshmana also, 
His temper came down and He said,

00:51:35.466 --> 00:51:37.600
“Can You not give Me some?”
She said, “Why?

00:51:37.639 --> 00:51:40.417
You were so angry, why should I give You?”

00:51:40.464 --> 00:51:43.249
Ultimately She gives Him that fruit.

00:51:43.327 --> 00:51:44.877
So what did He see in those fruits?

00:51:47.701 --> 00:51:56.745
It was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was important.

00:51:56.745 --> 00:52:03.175
So when you want to give something also it
is your love which is important, not how much

00:52:03.175 --> 00:52:06.165
you paid, what value you have spent, nothing.

00:52:06.165 --> 00:52:13.545
It’s the love with which you do it, and
that love should be evident.

00:52:13.545 --> 00:52:22.615
If such things can happen, even with Shri
Krishna the same thing happened.

00:52:22.615 --> 00:52:32.325
He went to - they called it Hastinapur in
those days, where these Kauravas were ruling.

00:52:32.325 --> 00:52:36.956
And the king was Duryodhana, and he asked
Him, “You come and stay with us and have

00:52:36.956 --> 00:52:37.956
food.”

00:52:37.956 --> 00:52:40.885
He said, “No, no, I won’t be able to come.”

00:52:40.885 --> 00:52:48.295
He goes to another person, Vidhura, who was
the son of a maidservant; Vidhura, because

00:52:48.295 --> 00:52:51.885
Vidhura was a realized soul.

00:52:51.885 --> 00:52:59.065
He was a realized soul, so He went and ate
in his house, where he had cooked very simple

00:52:59.065 --> 00:53:00.065
food.

00:53:00.065 --> 00:53:06.125
Because he was a realized soul, to Him he
was the best to have food with.

00:53:06.125 --> 00:53:14.395
So your value system should be based on such
things like love.

00:53:14.395 --> 00:53:19.735
Where you can get love, you should be attached
to that person.

00:53:19.735 --> 00:53:26.135
Where you get a realized soul, you should
be attached to them and not to worldly people

00:53:26.135 --> 00:53:29.855
who think no end of themselves, and think
that they are great.

00:53:29.855 --> 00:53:39.680
They may be, but to you as Sahaja Yogis it’s
the love of people which should be respected,

00:53:39.997 --> 00:53:43.705
should be understood and to be felt.

00:53:43.705 --> 00:53:50.160
But if you have no witness state, then you
will see how much money this man has got,

00:53:50.248 --> 00:53:57.535
how many cars he has got, what clothes he’s
wearing, all these considerations will be

00:53:57.535 --> 00:53:58.535
there.

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:03.705
But in a witness state, you will understand
that you will get vibrations from this person,

00:54:03.705 --> 00:54:08.855
you will understand that person is spiritual.

00:54:09.105 --> 00:54:18.145
And that’s how you will stick to such a
person, you will not go for artificial things,

00:54:18.145 --> 00:54:21.624
but the genuine personalities that are there.

00:54:22.782 --> 00:54:24.228
May God bless you all.

00:54:24.253 --> 00:54:25.253
Thank you.

00:54:49.276 --> 00:54:55.364
Today they have decided to read some of the
names Sahaja Yogis have got with them, and

00:54:55.403 --> 00:55:06.347
they want to distribute, they have distributed
these names to you.

00:55:07.103 --> 00:55:11.301
So somebody will read those names 
of Shri Krishna.

00:55:11.418 --> 00:55:12.789
Now just imagine

00:55:12.814 --> 00:55:17.341
with witness state all these
powers that are described of Shri Krishna,

00:55:17.412 --> 00:55:21.833
how they will act and 
how they will work through you.
