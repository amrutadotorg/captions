Shri Krishna Puja Talk
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:01.754 --> 00:02.754
August 16, 1998

00:04.940 --> 00:08.950
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

00:09.314 --> 00:29.344
It is a very important thing about the power
of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state.

00:29.344 --> 00:45.664
This is very important also because, in these
days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of

00:45.664 --> 01:05.405
value system, all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

01:05.405 --> 01:21.865
The state of witnessing is only possible through
meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless

01:21.865 --> 01:22.865
awareness.

01:22.865 --> 01:27.424
It’s combined together.

01:27.424 --> 01:34.845
Now the witness state is such a state where
you just do not react.

01:34.845 --> 01:47.244
If you react, then the problem starts.

01:47.244 --> 02:02.785
It’s a very simple thing to understand that
we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

02:02.785 --> 02:14.475
Otherwise there is no way to react.

02:14.475 --> 02:18.995
Anything, now for example there is a beautiful
carpet here.

02:18.995 --> 02:33.095
As soon as I look at it, if I use My ego I’ll
start thinking, “Now from where did they

02:33.095 --> 02:34.865
get it?

02:34.865 --> 02:39.285
How much they paid it?”

02:39.285 --> 02:43.365
This is the first reaction.

02:43.365 --> 02:47.075
Then you can even go further with it, anger
can come in, “Why did they bring such a

02:47.075 --> 02:48.495
nice carpet?

02:48.495 --> 02:54.175
What was the need to put it here?”

02:54.175 --> 03:00.225
It goes on like that, one after another.

03:00.225 --> 03:07.735
Now in My conditioning if I see these things,
I would say that “This color is not suited

03:07.735 --> 03:17.585
for Krishna Puja, they should have had another
color for this Krishna Puja.”

03:17.585 --> 03:23.445
So this kind goes on from one to another,
to another.

03:23.445 --> 03:29.525
But that means this conditioning is built
up within us.

03:29.525 --> 03:37.795
All our problems of our conditioning are really
horrible.

03:37.795 --> 03:41.335
For example, racialism.

03:41.335 --> 03:43.315
We have racialism.

03:43.315 --> 03:57.605
In America it’s very much more, you can
feel it though they don’t say; but if you

03:57.605 --> 04:05.065
go, say, from Italy you feel it, if you go
from India also you can feel it.

04:05.065 --> 04:10.385
Now why this racialism is there?

04:10.385 --> 04:13.075
What is the reason?

04:13.075 --> 04:29.155
Why do we react to this kind of horrible hatred
for another community or another color which

04:29.155 --> 04:34.535
is only skin-deep?

04:34.535 --> 04:42.795
Now with rationality you might be able to
explain, “O God, these people, they are

04:42.795 --> 04:52.945
absolutely useless,” or “They have come
to our country and are just troubling us.”

04:52.945 --> 04:56.075
All these conditionings are there.

04:56.075 --> 05:03.775
But if you see when they talk of immigrants,
the Americans must know they are immigrants,

05:03.775 --> 05:05.255
all of them.

05:05.255 --> 05:09.765
America never was their country.

05:09.765 --> 05:16.005
And they threw away all the other Red Indians,
took away their land and very nicely they

05:16.005 --> 05:18.545
are governors of America.

05:18.545 --> 05:31.225
But the reaction is, “Those who are not
white complexion, they are all to be condemned,

05:31.225 --> 05:32.415
tortured.”

05:32.415 --> 05:42.185
Now if they are by nature violent, then also
this conditioning of violence comes in.

05:42.185 --> 05:46.315
Then they start killing each other.

05:46.315 --> 05:56.385
They have killed ruthlessly so many people,
thinking that they have a right to go into

05:56.385 --> 06:05.835
any country and kill everyone and take the
land that is not their own.

06:05.835 --> 06:10.275
Actually, land doesn’t belong to anybody
as such.

06:10.275 --> 06:18.095
But nobody has a right to go to some land
and try to occupy it, and throw away the people

06:18.095 --> 06:21.145
who do not belong to that country.

06:21.145 --> 06:34.255
Yesterday was the Independence Day of India,
and I have seen the flag going up, our national

06:34.255 --> 06:45.235
flag, and the British flag going down.

06:45.235 --> 06:55.995
All that has happened after so much of struggle,
so much of sufferings of the people, because

06:55.995 --> 07:04.065
they came to India, landed nicely there and
became the masters.

07:04.065 --> 07:13.255
So this is also a kind of a conditioning that
comes in a collective way, that you go into

07:13.255 --> 07:20.715
anybody’s country, throw away the people
from there or sort of occupy that place, and

07:20.715 --> 07:21.955
become the masters.

07:21.955 --> 07:29.985
It’s like going into somebody’s house
that belongs to somebody, and throw away the

07:29.985 --> 07:40.245
people who are inside and nicely settle there
as the owners and the masters, because they

07:40.245 --> 07:45.155
have better intelligence, perhaps the cunning
more in them.

07:45.155 --> 07:57.125
With that cunning, if the white people think
they can rule the black people, is not where

07:57.125 --> 08:30.924
you can develop a witness state.

08:30.924 --> 08:39.685
So this kind of conditioning is like a plague
and moves from one country to another country,

08:39.685 --> 08:46.065
where some people think they are superior
and make people look inferior.

08:46.065 --> 08:52.165
And the people also are there who accept this
kind of a situation, accept this kind of a

08:52.165 --> 09:00.224
position, where they are supposed to be equal.

09:00.224 --> 09:07.435
I would say take the example of America, because
this has been celebrated by Americans and

09:07.435 --> 09:14.034
because Krishna is the Ruler, Krishna is the
Ruler of America.

09:14.034 --> 09:21.665
He Himself was a dark person, Himself was
on the black side.

09:21.665 --> 09:33.344
And in the same country where He rules, the
another great thing is that they don’t realize

09:33.344 --> 09:43.724
that if all the black or the Asians get out
of that country now, I don’t know what will

09:43.724 --> 09:44.954
happen to them.

09:44.954 --> 09:49.625
All their sports are managed by the blacks.

09:49.625 --> 09:58.915
If you want to see any American sport, ninety-nine
per cent are black people.

09:58.915 --> 10:07.024
Then if you want to also see the music, because
these black people, though they have black

10:07.024 --> 10:17.124
color - which is all right: as you have white,
they have black color - but they have a voice

10:17.124 --> 10:20.735
which the white people don’t have.

10:20.735 --> 10:26.795
They can sing so well that no white people
can compete with them.

10:26.795 --> 10:33.314
It’s a full justice done to the color.

10:33.314 --> 10:43.555
Now if you take out the Asians, all doctors,
all nurses, all architects, all accountants,

10:43.555 --> 10:47.814
all of them will disappear.

10:47.814 --> 10:51.224
Now what will remain?

10:51.224 --> 11:02.014
You have to understand that it is color which
is nothing to do, nothing to do with your

11:02.014 --> 11:08.105
intelligence, with your value system, with
your Spirit.

11:08.105 --> 11:14.385
We are here to achieve our spirituality.

11:14.385 --> 11:26.774
The Spirit doesn’t understand color because
it is so superficial, and it is so very cruel

11:26.774 --> 11:33.024
to condemn someone for the color.

11:33.024 --> 11:36.464
Same now is happening as the reaction.

11:36.464 --> 11:41.295
Every action has a reaction.

11:41.295 --> 11:47.764
So what happens is that you find the blacks
are reacting.

11:47.764 --> 11:53.694
They are reacting, and their reaction can
be very dangerous.

11:53.694 --> 12:07.024
Every day I read their reactions are coming
up so badly; not in America but all over,

12:07.024 --> 12:11.704
they are now thinking they must rise and oppose
this domination.

12:11.704 --> 12:21.714
But in their own country where they have people
of different colors, little variation I think,

12:21.714 --> 12:30.615
they are all black people but little variation
maybe, so they form groups and they start

12:30.615 --> 12:34.534
cutting each other’s throats.

12:34.534 --> 12:39.885
I’ve seen on the television how ruthlessly
they kill.

12:39.885 --> 12:48.014
I don’t know what is the difference of color
is, but somehow they have formed groups and

12:48.014 --> 12:52.644
this group will go and kill that, and that
group will come and kill.

12:52.644 --> 12:57.724
It’s not like Kaurava and Pandava.

12:57.724 --> 13:04.214
It’s not two types of people absolutely
opposite, it’s not that the negative and

13:04.214 --> 13:06.694
the positive is there, it’s not.

13:06.694 --> 13:14.384
They are all negative, whether they are white
or black, and they start quarreling and fighting

13:14.384 --> 13:17.514
with each other.

13:17.514 --> 13:19.985
Now this violence is growing so much.

13:19.985 --> 13:27.485
I think violence is the only weapon they use
now to express themselves.

13:27.485 --> 13:37.954
You see here something happens, so somewhere
there you find they explode bombs and kill

13:37.954 --> 13:39.605
so many innocent people.

13:39.605 --> 13:45.334
It’s very, very sinful to do like that.

13:45.334 --> 13:52.385
Even the slightest violence is sinful, and
this kind of a violence, in the eyes of Shri

13:52.385 --> 14:02.555
Krishna, are absolutely to be punished very
well.

14:02.555 --> 14:05.974
Now this comes through ego.

14:05.974 --> 14:13.705
You think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill, or something like

14:13.705 --> 14:14.705
that.

14:14.705 --> 14:22.774
A funny idea into human mind comes in, and
you decide that you have a right to kill another

14:22.774 --> 14:23.784
person.

14:23.784 --> 14:31.224
Or one may say this comes from hatred, but
hatred is an outcome of ego.

14:31.224 --> 14:42.024
When the ego starts acting, it collects all
these things like hatred, also possessiveness,

14:42.024 --> 14:53.384
anger, violence, all these starts coming out
of the ego, which actually blinds the person.

14:53.384 --> 14:59.884
You become blind to the fact that there is
no need to have violence, no need to hate

14:59.884 --> 15:07.855
someone, no need to kill anyone because of
this ego that is there.

15:07.855 --> 15:13.545
Now one may say, “Mother, how does this
ego build up in a people?”

15:13.545 --> 15:20.885
Of course, mostly it is due to reactions,
also it is due to the conditioning.

15:20.885 --> 15:28.735
If the child is told from the childhood that
“You should hate these people, they are

15:28.735 --> 15:30.124
to be hated.

15:30.124 --> 15:37.254
They are wrong people, they are bad people,”
they just start doing that.

15:37.254 --> 15:46.154
When they grow up they start showing that
hatred is now like a cactus growing very big,

15:46.154 --> 15:48.784
and is killing others.

15:48.784 --> 15:56.124
There’s no justification for this kind of
a behavior by human beings.

15:56.124 --> 16:04.974
If they are human beings they have to have
human qualities, and that is what is possible

16:04.974 --> 16:13.894
only if you learn how to just witness and
not to react.

16:13.894 --> 16:19.524
For example you see two cocks are fighting.

16:19.524 --> 16:22.194
You enjoy that.

16:22.194 --> 16:27.154
Two cocks are fighting, people are enjoying.

16:27.154 --> 16:33.404
One cock dies, they are very happy, as if
the one which died had killed his parents

16:33.404 --> 16:35.315
or did something like that.

16:35.315 --> 16:37.235
Very surprising!

16:37.235 --> 16:41.985
Now in Spain even now there are these bull-fights
going on.

16:41.985 --> 16:49.165
Every year six bull-fights, every year, and
the hall contains more than ten times more

16:49.165 --> 16:54.615
than we have here, and is always full.

16:54.615 --> 16:59.175
And now the women have taken to fight the
bulls.

16:59.175 --> 17:04.725
Now if the bull is not killed, they allow
the bulls to go on the street and kill people.

17:04.725 --> 17:19.004
This kind of a violent enjoyment is still
lingering into the minds of the people.

17:19.004 --> 17:29.845
It is so sad to see people who are now talking
of humanity, talking of peace, talking of

17:29.845 --> 17:36.614
joy, are still enjoying these violent acts.

17:36.614 --> 17:42.295
Either they are doing or they want to watch.

17:42.295 --> 17:49.445
So then you go to these films and things that
have been created of a horrible violence,

17:49.445 --> 17:56.085
and people enjoy it, enjoy such films, and
such films are again created.

17:56.085 --> 18:03.995
Now if you really become a witness state,
if you are in a witness state, then what will

18:03.995 --> 18:04.995
happen?

18:04.995 --> 18:12.775
If you watch any such things that are happening,
it will subside.

18:12.775 --> 18:23.275
If you are in a witness state and if that
level, then no accident will take place in

18:23.275 --> 18:25.275
your sight.

18:25.275 --> 18:34.185
Even if there is an accident, then you can
save the person, you can help the person very

18:34.185 --> 18:35.185
actively.

18:35.185 --> 18:41.905
That’s in a very small scale, but even in
a very large scale you can do it, something

18:41.905 --> 18:42.905
wonderful.

18:42.905 --> 18:50.004
I remember I was not very old at that time,
but we were living in a house very close to

18:50.004 --> 18:54.695
the Secretariat, where they had a strike.

18:54.695 --> 19:01.195
And they were asking for a separate Maharashtra
or something.

19:01.195 --> 19:08.625
So the police was standing there and by the
order of the Chief Minister they were shooting

19:08.625 --> 19:15.685
at everyone who was coming, anyone who passed
through that road they were shooting, they

19:15.685 --> 19:18.484
were enjoying their shooting game, all of
them.

19:18.484 --> 19:22.155
I saw all this and I just couldn’t bear
it.

19:22.155 --> 19:26.385
I just went down, went down and asked the
police to stop it.

19:26.385 --> 19:30.455
They stopped, you’d be amazed, they stopped.

19:30.455 --> 19:36.415
Then I carried those people who were wounded
up in My house, took out their bullets and

19:36.415 --> 19:39.885
all that, called the ambulance and saved them.

19:39.885 --> 19:46.425
But for that one thing was there: I was in
a state of witnessing, so you become fearless.

19:46.425 --> 19:55.185
There is no fear at all, once you learn how
to have the state of witnessing.

19:55.185 --> 20:03.325
Because when you are not witnessing you get
disturbed, you get upset, you get excited,

20:03.325 --> 20:06.285
you may join also these wrong type of people.

20:06.285 --> 20:14.185
But if you are in a state of witnessing, that
itself is a power.

20:14.185 --> 20:23.545
And that witnessing state helps you to win
over so many difficulties of other people.

20:23.545 --> 20:30.945
There’s this Chinese story about a saint.

20:30.945 --> 20:38.555
So one king brought his cock to him and said,
“You train my cock in such a way that he

20:38.555 --> 20:39.555
should win.”

20:39.555 --> 20:40.765
He said, “All right.”

20:40.765 --> 20:52.415
So he kept the cock of the king for one month
and when the show started, different cocks

20:52.415 --> 20:58.214
came from different places and they all started
fighting.

20:58.214 --> 21:04.615
This cock just stood up and was watching,
just watching.

21:04.615 --> 21:10.374
And other cocks got such a fright, they couldn’t
understand how this fellow is not disturbed,

21:10.374 --> 21:13.734
he’s just watching, he’s standing, he’s
doing nothing.

21:13.734 --> 21:20.395
So all they disappeared from the arena and
he was declared as the successful one.

21:20.395 --> 21:24.825
So this is the best way to bring non-violence.

21:24.825 --> 21:34.714
In violent places you go and stand steadily
there, facing all the things that are happening,

21:34.714 --> 21:48.584
and that witness state acts, acts and stops
that kind of a violence that is going on.

21:48.584 --> 21:58.464
But witness state is not a mental state, it
is a state of a spiritual ascent where you

21:58.464 --> 22:02.204
become a witness.

22:02.204 --> 22:10.744
Best way to practice witness state is not
to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

22:10.744 --> 22:15.645
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing
others.

22:15.645 --> 22:19.535
They cannot criticize themselves, so they
start criticizing other.

22:19.535 --> 22:24.695
So much so that they don’t even see what’s
wrong with them.

22:24.695 --> 22:30.645
They don’t even see what wrong they have
done to others, because they think they have

22:30.645 --> 22:36.675
a right to criticize others, and they enjoy
this criticism very well.

22:36.675 --> 22:40.345
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

22:40.345 --> 22:43.454
You just watch and see for yourself.

22:43.454 --> 22:45.935
That’s all is your right.

22:45.935 --> 22:50.135
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

22:50.135 --> 22:57.065
But some people think if you do not criticize,
then it will go on like this and it will never

22:57.065 --> 22:58.065
stop.

22:58.065 --> 22:59.065
It’s not that!

22:59.065 --> 23:02.844
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just
watch.

23:02.844 --> 23:11.185
Your attention itself is enlightened now,
with that enlightened attention you can just

23:11.185 --> 23:16.295
watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

23:16.295 --> 23:22.035
But we are always conscious that we are something
great, and we have to do this and we have

23:22.035 --> 23:24.964
to do that.

23:24.964 --> 23:34.575
Under these circumstances what happens is
that you become another problem.

23:34.575 --> 23:37.204
Because what can you do?

23:37.204 --> 23:39.844
You can’t do anything.

23:39.844 --> 23:44.135
But what you can do is to watch.

23:44.135 --> 23:54.155
By watching and by just seeing things as they
are, you really develop a very different state

23:54.155 --> 23:56.364
of being.

23:56.364 --> 24:08.074
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,
what happens to them is very interesting,

24:08.074 --> 24:14.435
that their memory loss is much less, because
whatever they see becomes like a picture to

24:14.435 --> 24:15.435
them.

24:15.435 --> 24:21.175
Like you can say, they can tell you even the
color, the folding, everything.

24:21.175 --> 24:27.995
Whatever they see is so much in their mind
like a photo, and they can tell you exactly

24:27.995 --> 24:35.765
what they have seen, and your memory is not
lost.

24:35.765 --> 24:43.095
While if you react onto everything, your memory
becomes horrible.

24:43.095 --> 24:48.214
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

24:48.214 --> 24:56.765
Like I know of one gentleman, he had a habit
of reacting, and I was going with him in the

24:56.765 --> 24:57.765
car.

24:57.765 --> 25:10.885
So he was reading every advertisement, every
name of every shop, every person, everything.

25:10.885 --> 25:13.185
He was just telling, “Who is that?

25:13.185 --> 25:14.295
What is that?”

25:14.295 --> 25:15.295
- this, that.

25:15.295 --> 25:21.074
I was wondering, “Look at this gentleman,
he’s talking so much, what will happen to

25:21.074 --> 25:22.074
him?”

25:22.074 --> 25:29.535
But ultimately I’ve found that all such
people who are all the time reacting become,

25:29.535 --> 25:35.965
actually they have, I think, senile decay
or maybe they become forgetful, very forgetful.

25:35.965 --> 25:41.824
But this is not the only loss we have.

25:41.824 --> 25:49.324
With this kind of people, when they are formed
into a collective they can be very dangerous

25:49.324 --> 25:55.074
people, because with that kind of a nature
they have to do something.

25:55.074 --> 26:01.425
They must do something because, after all,
they are combined together for a purpose or,

26:01.425 --> 26:06.094
we can say, for some reactions which all of
them have built up.

26:06.094 --> 26:11.854
In small things, in big things, you’ll find
people do like that.

26:11.854 --> 26:20.334
And some people who are very much, very much
developed in this kind of behavior can collect

26:20.334 --> 26:24.994
lots of people, and do any amount of harm
to others.

26:24.994 --> 26:28.244
I would look at the picture of Hitler.

26:28.244 --> 26:33.405
For nine years this fellow was watching what
wrongs Jews are doing.

26:33.405 --> 26:43.204
He wouldn’t watch what Germans are doing,
what wrong they are doing to the society.

26:43.204 --> 26:49.825
And that time the society also was very bad,
because they were having all kinds of licentiousness.

26:49.825 --> 26:56.874
Now he was noting down, “These Jews are
like this, they do this, they take money,

26:56.874 --> 27:01.655
they - lending money,” all kinds of things
he got into his head.

27:01.655 --> 27:08.405
As a result of that he built up a reaction
into him that “We must somehow or another

27:08.405 --> 27:13.765
see that these people go away from Germany.”

27:13.765 --> 27:19.775
But then he thought, “Even if they go away
from Germany, they’ll prosper again.

27:19.775 --> 27:21.234
So why not kill them?”

27:21.234 --> 27:29.395
I mean, to such an extent that even, you know,
you cannot see such films, you cannot see

27:29.395 --> 27:32.864
anything of that nature that Hitler did.

27:32.864 --> 27:40.864
But he did it, and people who followed him
also did it without feeling any hitch, as

27:40.864 --> 27:48.305
if it was a matter of great pleasure or a
joy, or maybe it’s a duty.

27:48.305 --> 27:54.474
How could they get duty bound to such a horrible
thing like killing thousands and thousands

27:54.474 --> 27:57.665
of Jews?

27:57.665 --> 28:01.915
What Jews had done to them, they could have
corrected it.

28:01.915 --> 28:05.175
But why did they indulge into such violence?

28:05.175 --> 28:09.185
And they wanted to finish all the Jews of
the world.

28:09.185 --> 28:17.454
It can be very, very dangerous, because once
you start losing your witness state you can

28:17.454 --> 28:22.364
fall into negative collectivity.

28:22.364 --> 28:29.464
And thus this negative collectivity acts,
acts in such a bad manner that all the conflicts

28:29.464 --> 28:36.734
of the world, all the problems of the world
perhaps are related with this.

28:36.734 --> 28:47.324
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

28:47.324 --> 28:58.204
We should not react, we should not react.

28:58.204 --> 29:07.594
If you see something wrong, all right, you
meditate on that point, you meditate.

29:07.594 --> 29:16.464
If you find anything wrong happening, all
right, meditate on that.

29:16.464 --> 29:21.594
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment
do not react.

29:21.594 --> 29:30.864
Afterwards when that person is quietened,
you tell him or tell her, because at that

29:30.864 --> 29:36.585
time when he’s so volatile or she’s volatile
if you tell, nothing will happen.

29:36.585 --> 29:43.984
Gradually, I don’t say always you can win
over such people, but gradually you may be

29:43.984 --> 29:52.795
able to make them understand that it’s wrong,
it’s wrong to do things which they have

29:52.795 --> 29:54.515
been doing.

29:54.515 --> 30:06.574
In a way, you see, the reaction to anything
which is stupid also can be very self-destroying.

30:06.574 --> 30:11.385
Like some people have built-in reactions,
like you have seen this Mr. Clinton behaving.

30:11.385 --> 30:18.545
I mean, you can’t understand a man of his
stature, of his level should have such reactions,

30:18.545 --> 30:25.545
but must be from his childhood or I don’t
know how he built it up.

30:25.545 --> 30:29.614
Now he is in trouble, and very shameful.

30:29.614 --> 30:41.535
This also is, I think perhaps comes from a
very great indulgence into reactions.

30:41.535 --> 30:48.854
Why should you react to a woman, I can’t
understand, or to a man?

30:48.854 --> 30:55.785
And this is one of the biggest problems of
today’s culture, specially in all the developed

30:55.785 --> 31:02.234
countries, that all the time men are looking
at women, women are looking at men.

31:02.234 --> 31:04.015
For what?

31:04.015 --> 31:08.925
Perhaps they look at women because they want
to see how many women are looking at them.

31:08.925 --> 31:16.815
Or they look at men perhaps may be that how
many men are looking at them.

31:16.815 --> 31:19.244
Why, why is this happening?

31:19.244 --> 31:25.655
Because they have some inferiority complex
in them, or that they want to attract the

31:25.655 --> 31:26.795
attention of everyone.

31:26.795 --> 31:32.364
I mean, horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others, to get

31:32.364 --> 31:33.895
the sympathy of others.

31:33.895 --> 31:39.285
I mean, if you see the level of your awareness
where it goes, you’ll be amazed.

31:39.285 --> 31:46.084
Like they say one lady killed her eight children
just to get sympathy from others.

31:46.084 --> 31:52.844
But think of such horrible things people are
doing.

31:52.844 --> 32:06.336
Now if you want others to have reaction you
do this, that they want others to see you

32:06.336 --> 32:16.194
or to react to you, I don’t know, to give
you importance, you can say.

32:16.194 --> 32:18.185
But what is the use of such an empty importance?

32:18.185 --> 32:29.565
But people are seeking, and is a very common
disease of modern life: all the time how you

32:29.565 --> 32:35.415
should look, how you should appear, how you
should walk.

32:35.415 --> 32:40.715
Everything is so stupid and wastage of energy.

32:40.715 --> 32:52.564
God has created human beings very, very different,
none of them are copies, none of them.

32:52.564 --> 33:01.574
Even in the nature you find the leaves of
trees, they are so unique, you cannot match

33:01.574 --> 33:05.075
them with another leaf.

33:05.075 --> 33:08.945
So that’s how human beings are created,
differently.

33:08.945 --> 33:12.825
They are made like that.

33:12.825 --> 33:16.415
One has to accept.

33:16.415 --> 33:18.454
Whatever you are, it’s all right.

33:18.454 --> 33:22.645
Why do you want to look like another person?

33:22.645 --> 33:29.485
This kind of reaction is extremely stupid,
I think, that we are spoiling our energy and

33:29.485 --> 33:35.844
life for something absolutely worthless.

33:35.844 --> 33:39.724
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is
great.

33:39.724 --> 33:51.114
You have come here to emancipate human beings
from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the

33:51.114 --> 33:54.835
way people are behaving.

33:54.835 --> 34:01.175
I don’t know whom to blame, but suddenly
our attention has become very diversified,

34:01.175 --> 34:05.305
our reactions have become very, very funny.

34:05.305 --> 34:13.435
One doesn’t know why people react like that,
and then why do we worry about what people

34:13.435 --> 34:14.435
react?

34:14.435 --> 34:22.955
All these things are not only on individual
level, but also on a collective level.

34:22.955 --> 34:29.085
As a result, you see, new kinds of value system
has been created.

34:29.085 --> 34:39.515
Now for a mother, say for example, she’ll
boast of how many men are running after her.

34:39.515 --> 34:44.225
Or she would think she is a great actress
- I don’t know what they think of themselves.

34:44.225 --> 34:47.624
And the way they talk about themselves is
something surprising.

34:47.624 --> 34:55.625
If she’s a mother, she has to be a good
mother and she has to look like a mother.

34:55.625 --> 35:09.715
But they are so much engrossed or they are
so much standing on the basis that they have

35:09.715 --> 35:20.865
to be extremely attractive, they have to be
the queens or I don’t know what, what a

35:20.865 --> 35:22.565
position they want to have.

35:22.565 --> 35:24.785
Same with the men.

35:24.785 --> 35:34.885
You see, if you have something within you,
if there is any quality within you, is there

35:34.885 --> 35:41.385
anything that can qualify you as a great man,
it will be showing.

35:41.385 --> 35:49.655
You don’t have to advertise, you don’t
have to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing.

35:49.655 --> 35:59.105
So that indifference if you have towards the
public opinion, I think you can achieve a

35:59.105 --> 36:00.295
lot.

36:00.295 --> 36:02.625
Most of the frustrations will disappear.

36:02.625 --> 36:10.865
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want
to show off a lot.

36:10.865 --> 36:13.225
I know who does that.

36:13.225 --> 36:21.855
But they should know, once you do not react
to outside you start reacting to inside, and

36:21.855 --> 36:28.075
introspection will start properly.

36:28.075 --> 36:43.085
When you see yourself you’ll be amazed how
admiring you are, how happy you are.

36:43.085 --> 36:51.835
Now if you go beyond that a little more, then
you don’t think of all these things.

36:51.835 --> 37:02.895
You just become thoughtless and you just stand
up as a person who is respected, whose company

37:02.895 --> 37:11.705
is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for.

37:11.705 --> 37:17.225
So one should not worry as to what people
react, what they say about you, what they

37:17.225 --> 37:19.725
think about you.

37:19.725 --> 37:24.415
You should just introspect and see for yourself.

37:24.415 --> 37:37.945
After some time you don’t need even introspection.

37:37.945 --> 37:47.545
It is a kind of a state I am talking about,
where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “I will

37:47.545 --> 37:52.015
not fight.

37:52.015 --> 38:02.535
So in between Me and the army, My army, you
have to select.”

38:02.535 --> 38:06.235
So Kauravas said, “No, we’ll take Your
army, Your army.

38:06.235 --> 38:13.205
You give us Your army and we’ll strengthen
our army.”

38:13.205 --> 38:20.725
But Arjuna said, “I don’t want army, I
want You.

38:20.725 --> 38:26.195
You don’t want to fight, it’s all right.”

38:26.195 --> 38:35.955
Because though He will be there in a witness
state only, He won’t be fighting but His

38:35.955 --> 38:38.835
power will act.

38:38.835 --> 38:48.555
He doesn’t have to fight, He doesn’t have
to do anything, but His own power which is

38:48.555 --> 38:57.765
outwardly is silent but will act, and that
is how we will win the war.

38:57.765 --> 39:00.775
So this power of witnessing you all should
develop.

39:00.775 --> 39:18.025
Try to develop it that when you are reacting,
stop reaction, stop reaction about everything.

39:18.025 --> 39:24.015
You will be amazed, you will find yourself
a very, very powerful person in the sense

39:24.015 --> 39:32.935
you’ll have no ambitions, you’ll have
no desires, you’ll have no special fondness

39:32.935 --> 39:35.395
or anything.

39:35.395 --> 39:38.975
But just you are witnessing the drama.

39:38.975 --> 39:46.706
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

39:46.706 --> 39:52.035
you understand the stupidity behind everything.

39:52.035 --> 40:04.375
You understand also how people have been so
violent, and you just laugh at it; you don’t

40:04.375 --> 40:10.265
get upset, excited, nothing, just laugh at
it.

40:10.265 --> 40:17.415
After some time you’ll be amazed, your witness
state will increase, and when in the collective

40:17.415 --> 40:28.636
all of you have that witness state, you can
do wonders without doing anything, without

40:28.636 --> 40:35.975
saying anything, without acting - only your
presence itself can work it out.

40:35.975 --> 40:41.825
I don’t say that it will have effect on
everyone, no, can’t say; but most of the

40:41.825 --> 40:45.175
people.

40:45.175 --> 40:56.335
Any person who is in that state, he is the
one who brings peace, he brings joy.

40:56.335 --> 41:06.175
I’ll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi who
was going to another island - he was living

41:06.175 --> 41:14.935
in an island - for Sahaja Yoga work, and he
found the whole sky was covered with very

41:14.935 --> 41:17.705
black clouds, thundering clouds.

41:17.705 --> 41:25.865
So he just looked at them like this and he
said, “Wait till I come back.

41:25.865 --> 41:30.355
I am going to do Mother’s work.”

41:30.355 --> 41:41.175
He went to another island, he did the program,
everything happened and when he came back

41:41.175 --> 41:50.875
he wanted to sleep, and suddenly it started
raining and thundering.

41:50.875 --> 41:53.575
Even the nature understands.

41:53.575 --> 42:00.335
Nature understands that you are in that great
state of witnessing.

42:00.335 --> 42:07.575
But if you are very ambitious - even in Sahaja
Yoga I have known people who are very ambitious,

42:07.575 --> 42:11.685
they want to become leaders, I don’t know
what else.

42:11.685 --> 42:13.715
Actually, it’s all a myth.

42:13.715 --> 42:21.095
All mythical things they want to get to, and
worry their heads about mythical things.

42:21.095 --> 42:27.985
Once you learn how to witness you will know
the myth, you will know the absurdity, you

42:27.985 --> 42:30.255
will know the maya.

42:30.255 --> 42:42.555
So to overcome the problems of personality
the best thing is to witness, practice witnessing

42:42.555 --> 42:52.675
everything: before talking, practice witnessing,
before giving any comments, just start witnessing.

42:52.675 --> 42:56.755
It’s a very, very satisfying attitude.

42:56.755 --> 43:11.845
In Shri Krishna’s life the greatest power
He was, a witnessing personality.

43:11.845 --> 43:23.025
Without doing anything, without taking a sword
in His hands, without talking about fighting,

43:23.025 --> 43:33.765
He is the One who has helped Pandavas to win
the war.

43:33.765 --> 43:43.515
Not only, but through His “Gita” He has
tried to tell us what we have to do to win

43:43.515 --> 43:46.595
the war over evil.

43:46.595 --> 43:54.865
Whole “Gita” is the witness state He’s
described about.

43:54.865 --> 44:01.225
If you read it “Gita” now from this angle,
you’ll be amazed to find that everywhere

44:01.225 --> 44:07.595
He is like a witness describing everything,
whatever He sees.

44:07.595 --> 44:19.065
And He will tell you how, how this witness
state has helped Him to understand also human

44:19.065 --> 44:20.065
beings.

44:20.065 --> 44:29.465
He is a man who was, we should say, was not
such a big businessman; because first He told

44:29.465 --> 44:32.515
you that how to become sthita pragnya.

44:32.515 --> 44:38.845
“Sthita pragnya” is the one who is in
the witness state.

44:38.845 --> 44:46.435
If you see all these verses on sthita pragnya,
is nothing but a person who is in a witness

44:46.435 --> 44:53.875
state: how he lives, how he is happy, how
he looks at things.

44:53.875 --> 44:56.805
It’s interesting, very interesting.

44:56.805 --> 45:03.015
First He describes that, not like the sharp
people who will describe first the bad things,

45:03.015 --> 45:05.555
but He starts with the best.

45:05.555 --> 45:16.305
Then He goes down to other things and tell
you that whatever are the three aspects.

45:16.305 --> 45:22.955
The first He talks about karma, and many people
get stuck at that point, that “Whatever

45:22.955 --> 45:26.945
karmas we are doing, we’ll get the punyas
out of it.”

45:26.945 --> 45:30.135
But He is not.

45:30.135 --> 45:33.335
He didn’t say that.

45:33.335 --> 45:37.355
If you know Him, then you will know He never
meant that.

45:37.355 --> 45:48.235
What He says, that “Whatever karmas you
have to do, you can do it, but leave the results

45:48.235 --> 45:51.085
to the Divine Power.”

45:51.085 --> 45:58.235
Results are from the Divine Power.

45:58.235 --> 46:06.965
Now may be that some people think that they
have got money because they have done good

46:06.965 --> 46:14.355
karmas, and start doing all kinds of bad karmas
with that money.

46:14.355 --> 46:15.685
He didn’t say that.

46:15.685 --> 46:20.375
He said, “Leave the results to the Divine
Power.”

46:20.375 --> 46:26.435
Because Divine Power knows best what is for
you.

46:26.435 --> 46:32.525
And so if you think you have done something
good, you have served somewhere to the poor,

46:32.525 --> 46:42.005
you have done something really good for the
women or anything; the result of that, you

46:42.005 --> 46:53.175
leave it at the feet of the Divine Power - means
that you don’t build up an ego for whatever

46:53.175 --> 46:55.495
you have done.

46:55.495 --> 47:01.685
Though very well He has written this, but
to understand Him one should have again the

47:01.685 --> 47:07.945
witness state to see what He has written about
karma.

47:07.945 --> 47:10.155
Then He has written about gnyana.

47:10.155 --> 47:14.525
Gnyana means “where you know.”

47:14.525 --> 47:21.105
But that doesn’t mean you go on reading
books, never.

47:21.105 --> 47:29.595
Gnyana means to know what you are.

47:29.595 --> 47:43.085
That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi, by
which you know so many things through vibrations.

47:43.085 --> 47:49.045
Gnyana doesn’t mean reading books.

47:49.045 --> 47:54.365
By reading books you become more ignorant.

47:54.365 --> 48:03.005
So gnyana means that you must know yourself.

48:03.005 --> 48:07.165
If you do not know yourself, you do not know
anything.

48:07.165 --> 48:13.125
So it comes to, that you must get your Self
Realization.

48:13.125 --> 48:14.575
You must know yourself.

48:14.575 --> 48:16.965
It’s the second thing He has said.

48:16.965 --> 48:20.195
Lastly, He talks about bhakti.

48:20.195 --> 48:25.795
Bhakti is devotion.

48:25.795 --> 48:29.975
That too is another trick of Shri Krishna,
the way He describes bhakti.

48:29.975 --> 48:36.875
Now you find people on the street, “Hare
Rama, Hare Krishna” singing.

48:36.875 --> 48:42.695
In one word He is concluded: He says, “You
must do ananya bhakti.”

48:42.695 --> 48:46.995
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

48:46.995 --> 48:54.275
That means when you have submerged yourself
into the Divine, you are one with the Divine,

48:54.275 --> 48:59.505
then you should do bhakti, otherwise I do
not accept.

48:59.505 --> 49:13.505
He says that “If you give Me some leaves
or some fruits or some flowers, I will accept,

49:13.505 --> 49:23.475
I will accept,” but for Him the real bhakti
is only possible when you become one with

49:23.475 --> 49:30.675
the Divine; otherwise it’s just a show.

49:30.675 --> 49:35.805
So the third bhakti part also comes after
Self Realization.

49:35.805 --> 49:48.365
Now in the bhakti you see there is no “what
is the value is and how much you’ve paid

49:48.365 --> 49:51.825
for it, and how you bought it”- it’s not
important.

49:51.825 --> 50:01.875
For that, a great example is of Shri Rama
when He went in the jungles.

50:01.875 --> 50:13.995
There was a old lady from the schedules caste,
means she was one of the Bhilini as they call

50:13.995 --> 50:18.045
it, these people live in the jungles.

50:18.045 --> 50:25.685
So she brought some berries and offered it
to Shri Ram.

50:25.685 --> 50:34.515
And she said that “I have tasted all of
them and they are not sour, all of them I

50:34.515 --> 50:36.095
have tasted.”

50:36.095 --> 50:44.675
Now after tasting something in India, people
call it, is become not to be eaten.

50:44.675 --> 50:49.635
I mean, we cannot taste something and give
it to somebody else, it’s not done according

50:49.635 --> 50:51.085
to Indian culture.

50:51.085 --> 50:53.495
But Shri Rama took it.

50:53.495 --> 50:57.345
He took it and said, “What beautiful fruits!

50:57.345 --> 51:02.945
I’ve never eaten such fruits!”

51:02.945 --> 51:04.585
So Lakshmana got very angry.

51:04.585 --> 51:10.015
He said, “You stupid woman, you have eaten
these fruits and that’s what you are giving

51:10.015 --> 51:11.205
to Shri Ram.

51:11.205 --> 51:14.925
Why did you do that?”

51:14.925 --> 51:21.445
So Sita was watching, so She asked Him, “Why
don’t You give Me some of these fruits?”

51:21.445 --> 51:22.795
He gave.

51:22.795 --> 51:27.255
She said, “My God, what nice fruits these
are!

51:27.255 --> 51:30.295
I have never eaten such good fruits.”

51:30.295 --> 51:35.235
So then Lakshmana also, His temper came down
and He said, “Can You not give Me some?”

51:35.235 --> 51:36.345
She said, “Why?

51:36.345 --> 51:39.665
You were so angry, why should I give You?”

51:39.665 --> 51:42.025
Ultimately She gives Him that fruit.

51:42.025 --> 51:43.575
So what did He see in those fruits?

51:43.575 --> 51:56.745
It was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was important.

51:56.745 --> 52:03.175
So when you want to give something also it
is your love which is important, not how much

52:03.175 --> 52:06.165
you paid, what value you have spent, nothing.

52:06.165 --> 52:13.545
It’s the love with which you do it, and
that love should be evident.

52:13.545 --> 52:22.615
If such things can happen, even with Shri
Krishna the same thing happened.

52:22.615 --> 52:32.325
He went to - they called it Hastinapur in
those days, where these Kauravas were ruling.

52:32.325 --> 52:36.956
And the king was Duryodhana, and he asked
Him, “You come and stay with us and have

52:36.956 --> 52:37.956
food.”

52:37.956 --> 52:40.885
He said, “No, no, I won’t be able to come.”

52:40.885 --> 52:48.295
He goes to another person, Vidhura, who was
the son of a maidservant; Vidhura, because

52:48.295 --> 52:51.885
Vidhura was a realized soul.

52:51.885 --> 52:59.065
He was a realized soul, so He went and ate
in his house, where he had cooked very simple

52:59.065 --> 53:00.065
food.

53:00.065 --> 53:06.125
Because he was a realized soul, to Him he
was the best to have food with.

53:06.125 --> 53:14.395
So your value system should be based on such
things like love.

53:14.395 --> 53:19.735
Where you can get love, you should be attached
to that person.

53:19.735 --> 53:26.135
Where you get a realized soul, you should
be attached to them and not to worldly people

53:26.135 --> 53:29.855
who think no end of themselves, and think
that they are great.

53:29.855 --> 53:39.095
They may be, but to you as Sahaja Yogis it’s
the love of people which should be respected,

53:39.095 --> 53:43.705
should be understood and to be felt.

53:43.705 --> 53:48.885
But if you have no witness state, then you
will see how much money this man has got,

53:48.885 --> 53:57.535
how many cars he has got, what clothes he’s
wearing, all these considerations will be

53:57.535 --> 53:58.535
there.

53:58.535 --> 54:03.705
But in a witness state, you will understand
that you will get vibrations from this person,

54:03.705 --> 54:08.855
you will understand that person is spiritual.

54:09.105 --> 54:18.145
And that’s how you will stick to such a
person, you will not go for artificial things,

54:18.145 --> 54:21.624
but the genuine personalities that are there.

54:22.003 --> 54:23.554
May God bless you all.

54:24.253 --> 54:25.253
Thank you.

54:49.007 --> 54:56.027
Today they have decided to read some of the
names Sahaja Yogis have got with them, and

54:56.077 --> 55:06.347
they want to distribute, they have distributed
these names to you.

55:06.980 --> 55:11.480
So somebody will read those names of Shri
Krishna.

55:11.497 --> 55:17.210
Now just imagine with witness state all these
powers that are described of Shri Krishna,

55:17.244 --> 55:22.654
how they will act and how they will work through
you.
