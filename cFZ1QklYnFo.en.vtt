Shri Krishna Puja Talk
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:01.754 --> 00:00:02.754
August 16, 1998

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.950
Today we are going to have Shri Krishna Puja.

00:00:09.314 --> 00:00:29.344
It is a very important thing about the power
of Shri Krishna that gives you a witness state.

00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:45.664
This is very important also because, in these
days of Kali Yuga and complete confusion of

00:00:45.664 --> 00:01:05.405
value system, all kinds of turmoil makes a
very complex conditions to exist.

00:01:05.405 --> 00:01:21.865
The state of witnessing is only possible through
meditation: you reach the state of thoughtless

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:22.865
awareness.

00:01:22.865 --> 00:01:27.424
It’s combined together.

00:01:27.424 --> 00:01:34.845
Now the witness state is such a state where
you just do not react.

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:47.244
If you react, then the problem starts.

00:01:47.244 --> 00:02:02.785
It’s a very simple thing to understand that
we react through our ego or through our conditioning.

00:02:02.785 --> 00:02:14.475
Otherwise there is no way to react.

00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:18.995
Anything, now for example there is a beautiful
carpet here.

00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:33.095
As soon as I look at it, if I use My ego I’ll
start thinking, “Now from where did they

00:02:33.095 --> 00:02:34.865
get it?

00:02:34.865 --> 00:02:39.285
How much they paid it?”

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:43.365
This is the first reaction.

00:02:43.365 --> 00:02:47.075
Then you can even go further with it, anger
can come in, “Why did they bring such a

00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:48.495
nice carpet?

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:54.175
What was the need to put it here?”

00:02:54.175 --> 00:03:00.225
It goes on like that, one after another.

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:07.735
Now in My conditioning if I see these things,
I would say that “This color is not suited

00:03:07.735 --> 00:03:17.585
for Krishna Puja, they should have had another
color for this Krishna Puja.”

00:03:17.585 --> 00:03:23.445
So this kind goes on from one to another,
to another.

00:03:23.445 --> 00:03:29.525
But that means this conditioning is built
up within us.

00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:37.795
All our problems of our conditioning are really
horrible.

00:03:37.795 --> 00:03:41.335
For example, racialism.

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:43.315
We have racialism.

00:03:43.315 --> 00:03:57.605
In America it’s very much more, you can
feel it though they don’t say; but if you

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:05.065
go, say, from Italy you feel it, if you go
from India also you can feel it.

00:04:05.065 --> 00:04:10.385
Now why this racialism is there?

00:04:10.385 --> 00:04:13.075
What is the reason?

00:04:13.075 --> 00:04:29.155
Why do we react to this kind of horrible hatred
for another community or another color which

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:34.535
is only skin-deep?

00:04:34.535 --> 00:04:42.795
Now with rationality you might be able to
explain, “O God, these people, they are

00:04:42.795 --> 00:04:52.945
absolutely useless,” or “They have come
to our country and are just troubling us.”

00:04:52.945 --> 00:04:56.075
All these conditionings are there.

00:04:56.075 --> 00:05:03.775
But if you see when they talk of immigrants,
the Americans must know they are immigrants,

00:05:03.775 --> 00:05:05.255
all of them.

00:05:05.255 --> 00:05:09.765
America never was their country.

00:05:09.765 --> 00:05:16.005
And they threw away all the other Red Indians,
took away their land and very nicely they

00:05:16.005 --> 00:05:18.545
are governors of America.

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:31.225
But the reaction is, “Those who are not
white complexion, they are all to be condemned,

00:05:31.225 --> 00:05:32.415
tortured.”

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:42.185
Now if they are by nature violent, then also
this conditioning of violence comes in.

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:46.315
Then they start killing each other.

00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:56.385
They have killed ruthlessly so many people,
thinking that they have a right to go into

00:05:56.385 --> 00:06:05.835
any country and kill everyone and take the
land that is not their own.

00:06:05.835 --> 00:06:10.275
Actually, land doesn’t belong to anybody
as such.

00:06:10.275 --> 00:06:18.095
But nobody has a right to go to some land
and try to occupy it, and throw away the people

00:06:18.095 --> 00:06:21.145
who do not belong to that country.

00:06:21.145 --> 00:06:34.255
Yesterday was the Independence Day of India,
and I have seen the flag going up, our national

00:06:34.255 --> 00:06:45.235
flag, and the British flag going down.

00:06:45.235 --> 00:06:55.995
All that has happened after so much of struggle,
so much of sufferings of the people, because

00:06:55.995 --> 00:07:04.065
they came to India, landed nicely there and
became the masters.

00:07:04.065 --> 00:07:13.255
So this is also a kind of a conditioning that
comes in a collective way, that you go into

00:07:13.255 --> 00:07:20.715
anybody’s country, throw away the people
from there or sort of occupy that place, and

00:07:20.715 --> 00:07:21.955
become the masters.

00:07:21.955 --> 00:07:29.985
It’s like going into somebody’s house
that belongs to somebody, and throw away the

00:07:29.985 --> 00:07:40.245
people who are inside and nicely settle there
as the owners and the masters, because they

00:07:40.245 --> 00:07:45.155
have better intelligence, perhaps the cunning
more in them.

00:07:45.155 --> 00:07:57.125
With that cunning, if the white people think
they can rule the black people, is not where

00:07:57.125 --> 00:08:30.924
you can develop a witness state.

00:08:30.924 --> 00:08:39.685
So this kind of conditioning is like a plague
and moves from one country to another country,

00:08:39.685 --> 00:08:46.065
where some people think they are superior
and make people look inferior.

00:08:46.065 --> 00:08:52.165
And the people also are there who accept this
kind of a situation, accept this kind of a

00:08:52.165 --> 00:09:00.224
position, where they are supposed to be equal.

00:09:00.224 --> 00:09:07.435
I would say take the example of America, because
this has been celebrated by Americans and

00:09:07.435 --> 00:09:14.034
because Krishna is the Ruler, Krishna is the
Ruler of America.

00:09:14.034 --> 00:09:21.665
He Himself was a dark person, Himself was
on the black side.

00:09:21.665 --> 00:09:33.344
And in the same country where He rules, the
another great thing is that they don’t realize

00:09:33.344 --> 00:09:43.724
that if all the black or the Asians get out
of that country now, I don’t know what will

00:09:43.724 --> 00:09:44.954
happen to them.

00:09:44.954 --> 00:09:49.625
All their sports are managed by the blacks.

00:09:49.625 --> 00:09:58.915
If you want to see any American sport, ninety-nine
per cent are black people.

00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:07.024
Then if you want to also see the music, because
these black people, though they have black

00:10:07.024 --> 00:10:17.124
color - which is all right: as you have white,
they have black color - but they have a voice

00:10:17.124 --> 00:10:20.735
which the white people don’t have.

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:26.795
They can sing so well that no white people
can compete with them.

00:10:26.795 --> 00:10:33.314
It’s a full justice done to the color.

00:10:33.314 --> 00:10:43.555
Now if you take out the Asians, all doctors,
all nurses, all architects, all accountants,

00:10:43.555 --> 00:10:47.814
all of them will disappear.

00:10:47.814 --> 00:10:51.224
Now what will remain?

00:10:51.224 --> 00:11:02.014
You have to understand that it is color which
is nothing to do, nothing to do with your

00:11:02.014 --> 00:11:08.105
intelligence, with your value system, with
your Spirit.

00:11:08.105 --> 00:11:14.385
We are here to achieve our spirituality.

00:11:14.385 --> 00:11:26.774
The Spirit doesn’t understand color because
it is so superficial, and it is so very cruel

00:11:26.774 --> 00:11:33.024
to condemn someone for the color.

00:11:33.024 --> 00:11:36.464
Same now is happening as the reaction.

00:11:36.464 --> 00:11:41.295
Every action has a reaction.

00:11:41.295 --> 00:11:47.764
So what happens is that you find the blacks
are reacting.

00:11:47.764 --> 00:11:53.694
They are reacting, and their reaction can
be very dangerous.

00:11:53.694 --> 00:12:07.024
Every day I read their reactions are coming
up so badly; not in America but all over,

00:12:07.024 --> 00:12:11.704
they are now thinking they must rise and oppose
this domination.

00:12:11.704 --> 00:12:21.714
But in their own country where they have people
of different colors, little variation I think,

00:12:21.714 --> 00:12:30.615
they are all black people but little variation
maybe, so they form groups and they start

00:12:30.615 --> 00:12:34.534
cutting each other’s throats.

00:12:34.534 --> 00:12:39.885
I’ve seen on the television how ruthlessly
they kill.

00:12:39.885 --> 00:12:48.014
I don’t know what is the difference of color
is, but somehow they have formed groups and

00:12:48.014 --> 00:12:52.644
this group will go and kill that, and that
group will come and kill.

00:12:52.644 --> 00:12:57.724
It’s not like Kaurava and Pandava.

00:12:57.724 --> 00:13:04.214
It’s not two types of people absolutely
opposite, it’s not that the negative and

00:13:04.214 --> 00:13:06.694
the positive is there, it’s not.

00:13:06.694 --> 00:13:14.384
They are all negative, whether they are white
or black, and they start quarreling and fighting

00:13:14.384 --> 00:13:17.514
with each other.

00:13:17.514 --> 00:13:19.985
Now this violence is growing so much.

00:13:19.985 --> 00:13:27.485
I think violence is the only weapon they use
now to express themselves.

00:13:27.485 --> 00:13:37.954
You see here something happens, so somewhere
there you find they explode bombs and kill

00:13:37.954 --> 00:13:39.605
so many innocent people.

00:13:39.605 --> 00:13:45.334
It’s very, very sinful to do like that.

00:13:45.334 --> 00:13:52.385
Even the slightest violence is sinful, and
this kind of a violence, in the eyes of Shri

00:13:52.385 --> 00:14:02.555
Krishna, are absolutely to be punished very
well.

00:14:02.555 --> 00:14:05.974
Now this comes through ego.

00:14:05.974 --> 00:14:13.705
You think because you belong to one clan,
another clan you can kill, or something like

00:14:13.705 --> 00:14:14.705
that.

00:14:14.705 --> 00:14:22.774
A funny idea into human mind comes in, and
you decide that you have a right to kill another

00:14:22.774 --> 00:14:23.784
person.

00:14:23.784 --> 00:14:31.224
Or one may say this comes from hatred, but
hatred is an outcome of ego.

00:14:31.224 --> 00:14:42.024
When the ego starts acting, it collects all
these things like hatred, also possessiveness,

00:14:42.024 --> 00:14:53.384
anger, violence, all these starts coming out
of the ego, which actually blinds the person.

00:14:53.384 --> 00:14:59.884
You become blind to the fact that there is
no need to have violence, no need to hate

00:14:59.884 --> 00:15:07.855
someone, no need to kill anyone because of
this ego that is there.

00:15:07.855 --> 00:15:13.545
Now one may say, “Mother, how does this
ego build up in a people?”

00:15:13.545 --> 00:15:20.885
Of course, mostly it is due to reactions,
also it is due to the conditioning.

00:15:20.885 --> 00:15:28.735
If the child is told from the childhood that
“You should hate these people, they are

00:15:28.735 --> 00:15:30.124
to be hated.

00:15:30.124 --> 00:15:37.254
They are wrong people, they are bad people,”
they just start doing that.

00:15:37.254 --> 00:15:46.154
When they grow up they start showing that
hatred is now like a cactus growing very big,

00:15:46.154 --> 00:15:48.784
and is killing others.

00:15:48.784 --> 00:15:56.124
There’s no justification for this kind of
a behavior by human beings.

00:15:56.124 --> 00:16:04.974
If they are human beings they have to have
human qualities, and that is what is possible

00:16:04.974 --> 00:16:13.894
only if you learn how to just witness and
not to react.

00:16:13.894 --> 00:16:19.524
For example you see two cocks are fighting.

00:16:19.524 --> 00:16:22.194
You enjoy that.

00:16:22.194 --> 00:16:27.154
Two cocks are fighting, people are enjoying.

00:16:27.154 --> 00:16:33.404
One cock dies, they are very happy, as if
the one which died had killed his parents

00:16:33.404 --> 00:16:35.315
or did something like that.

00:16:35.315 --> 00:16:37.235
Very surprising!

00:16:37.235 --> 00:16:41.985
Now in Spain even now there are these bull-fights
going on.

00:16:41.985 --> 00:16:49.165
Every year six bull-fights, every year, and
the hall contains more than ten times more

00:16:49.165 --> 00:16:54.615
than we have here, and is always full.

00:16:54.615 --> 00:16:59.175
And now the women have taken to fight the
bulls.

00:16:59.175 --> 00:17:04.725
Now if the bull is not killed, they allow
the bulls to go on the street and kill people.

00:17:04.725 --> 00:17:19.004
This kind of a violent enjoyment is still
lingering into the minds of the people.

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:29.845
It is so sad to see people who are now talking
of humanity, talking of peace, talking of

00:17:29.845 --> 00:17:36.614
joy, are still enjoying these violent acts.

00:17:36.614 --> 00:17:42.295
Either they are doing or they want to watch.

00:17:42.295 --> 00:17:49.445
So then you go to these films and things that
have been created of a horrible violence,

00:17:49.445 --> 00:17:56.085
and people enjoy it, enjoy such films, and
such films are again created.

00:17:56.085 --> 00:18:03.995
Now if you really become a witness state,
if you are in a witness state, then what will

00:18:03.995 --> 00:18:04.995
happen?

00:18:04.995 --> 00:18:12.775
If you watch any such things that are happening,
it will subside.

00:18:12.775 --> 00:18:23.275
If you are in a witness state and if that
level, then no accident will take place in

00:18:23.275 --> 00:18:25.275
your sight.

00:18:25.275 --> 00:18:34.185
Even if there is an accident, then you can
save the person, you can help the person very

00:18:34.185 --> 00:18:35.185
actively.

00:18:35.185 --> 00:18:41.905
That’s in a very small scale, but even in
a very large scale you can do it, something

00:18:41.905 --> 00:18:42.905
wonderful.

00:18:42.905 --> 00:18:50.004
I remember I was not very old at that time,
but we were living in a house very close to

00:18:50.004 --> 00:18:54.695
the Secretariat, where they had a strike.

00:18:54.695 --> 00:19:01.195
And they were asking for a separate Maharashtra
or something.

00:19:01.195 --> 00:19:08.625
So the police was standing there and by the
order of the Chief Minister they were shooting

00:19:08.625 --> 00:19:15.685
at everyone who was coming, anyone who passed
through that road they were shooting, they

00:19:15.685 --> 00:19:18.484
were enjoying their shooting game, all of
them.

00:19:18.484 --> 00:19:22.155
I saw all this and I just couldn’t bear
it.

00:19:22.155 --> 00:19:26.385
I just went down, went down and asked the
police to stop it.

00:19:26.385 --> 00:19:30.455
They stopped, you’d be amazed, they stopped.

00:19:30.455 --> 00:19:36.415
Then I carried those people who were wounded
up in My house, took out their bullets and

00:19:36.415 --> 00:19:39.885
all that, called the ambulance and saved them.

00:19:39.885 --> 00:19:46.425
But for that one thing was there: I was in
a state of witnessing, so you become fearless.

00:19:46.425 --> 00:19:55.185
There is no fear at all, once you learn how
to have the state of witnessing.

00:19:55.185 --> 00:20:03.325
Because when you are not witnessing you get
disturbed, you get upset, you get excited,

00:20:03.325 --> 00:20:06.285
you may join also these wrong type of people.

00:20:06.285 --> 00:20:14.185
But if you are in a state of witnessing, that
itself is a power.

00:20:14.185 --> 00:20:23.545
And that witnessing state helps you to win
over so many difficulties of other people.

00:20:23.545 --> 00:20:30.945
There’s this Chinese story about a saint.

00:20:30.945 --> 00:20:38.555
So one king brought his cock to him and said,
“You train my cock in such a way that he

00:20:38.555 --> 00:20:39.555
should win.”

00:20:39.555 --> 00:20:40.765
He said, “All right.”

00:20:40.765 --> 00:20:52.415
So he kept the cock of the king for one month
and when the show started, different cocks

00:20:52.415 --> 00:20:58.214
came from different places and they all started
fighting.

00:20:58.214 --> 00:21:04.615
This cock just stood up and was watching,
just watching.

00:21:04.615 --> 00:21:10.374
And other cocks got such a fright, they couldn’t
understand how this fellow is not disturbed,

00:21:10.374 --> 00:21:13.734
he’s just watching, he’s standing, he’s
doing nothing.

00:21:13.734 --> 00:21:20.395
So all they disappeared from the arena and
he was declared as the successful one.

00:21:20.395 --> 00:21:24.825
So this is the best way to bring non-violence.

00:21:24.825 --> 00:21:34.714
In violent places you go and stand steadily
there, facing all the things that are happening,

00:21:34.714 --> 00:21:48.584
and that witness state acts, acts and stops
that kind of a violence that is going on.

00:21:48.584 --> 00:21:58.464
But witness state is not a mental state, it
is a state of a spiritual ascent where you

00:21:58.464 --> 00:22:02.204
become a witness.

00:22:02.204 --> 00:22:10.744
Best way to practice witness state is not
to criticize anyone, not to criticize.

00:22:10.744 --> 00:22:15.645
I’ve seen people who are all the time criticizing
others.

00:22:15.645 --> 00:22:19.535
They cannot criticize themselves, so they
start criticizing other.

00:22:19.535 --> 00:22:24.695
So much so that they don’t even see what’s
wrong with them.

00:22:24.695 --> 00:22:30.645
They don’t even see what wrong they have
done to others, because they think they have

00:22:30.645 --> 00:22:36.675
a right to criticize others, and they enjoy
this criticism very well.

00:22:36.675 --> 00:22:40.345
Actually there’s nothing to be criticized.

00:22:40.345 --> 00:22:43.454
You just watch and see for yourself.

00:22:43.454 --> 00:22:45.935
That’s all is your right.

00:22:45.935 --> 00:22:50.135
You have no right to criticize anyone or anything.

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:57.065
But some people think if you do not criticize,
then it will go on like this and it will never

00:22:57.065 --> 00:22:58.065
stop.

00:22:58.065 --> 00:22:59.065
It’s not that!

00:22:59.065 --> 00:23:02.844
Once you watch the thing yourself, only just
watch.

00:23:02.844 --> 00:23:11.185
Your attention itself is enlightened now,
with that enlightened attention you can just

00:23:11.185 --> 00:23:16.295
watch and stop the nonsense that is there.

00:23:16.295 --> 00:23:22.035
But we are always conscious that we are something
great, and we have to do this and we have

00:23:22.035 --> 00:23:24.964
to do that.

00:23:24.964 --> 00:23:34.575
Under these circumstances what happens is
that you become another problem.

00:23:34.575 --> 00:23:37.204
Because what can you do?

00:23:37.204 --> 00:23:39.844
You can’t do anything.

00:23:39.844 --> 00:23:44.135
But what you can do is to watch.

00:23:44.135 --> 00:23:54.155
By watching and by just seeing things as they
are, you really develop a very different state

00:23:54.155 --> 00:23:56.364
of being.

00:23:56.364 --> 00:24:08.074
Firstly all such people who are just witnessing,
what happens to them is very interesting,

00:24:08.074 --> 00:24:14.435
that their memory loss is much less, because
whatever they see becomes like a picture to

00:24:14.435 --> 00:24:15.435
them.

00:24:15.435 --> 00:24:21.175
Like you can say, they can tell you even the
color, the folding, everything.

00:24:21.175 --> 00:24:27.995
Whatever they see is so much in their mind
like a photo, and they can tell you exactly

00:24:27.995 --> 00:24:35.765
what they have seen, and your memory is not
lost.

00:24:35.765 --> 00:24:43.095
While if you react onto everything, your memory
becomes horrible.

00:24:43.095 --> 00:24:48.214
And people are so much habituated with reacting.

00:24:48.214 --> 00:24:56.765
Like I know of one gentleman, he had a habit
of reacting, and I was going with him in the

00:24:56.765 --> 00:24:57.765
car.

00:24:57.765 --> 00:25:10.885
So he was reading every advertisement, every
name of every shop, every person, everything.

00:25:10.885 --> 00:25:13.185
He was just telling, “Who is that?

00:25:13.185 --> 00:25:14.295
What is that?”

00:25:14.295 --> 00:25:15.295
- this, that.

00:25:15.295 --> 00:25:21.074
I was wondering, “Look at this gentleman,
he’s talking so much, what will happen to

00:25:21.074 --> 00:25:22.074
him?”

00:25:22.074 --> 00:25:29.535
But ultimately I’ve found that all such
people who are all the time reacting become,

00:25:29.535 --> 00:25:35.965
actually they have, I think, senile decay
or maybe they become forgetful, very forgetful.

00:25:35.965 --> 00:25:41.824
But this is not the only loss we have.

00:25:41.824 --> 00:25:49.324
With this kind of people, when they are formed
into a collective they can be very dangerous

00:25:49.324 --> 00:25:55.074
people, because with that kind of a nature
they have to do something.

00:25:55.074 --> 00:26:01.425
They must do something because, after all,
they are combined together for a purpose or,

00:26:01.425 --> 00:26:06.094
we can say, for some reactions which all of
them have built up.

00:26:06.094 --> 00:26:11.854
In small things, in big things, you’ll find
people do like that.

00:26:11.854 --> 00:26:20.334
And some people who are very much, very much
developed in this kind of behavior can collect

00:26:20.334 --> 00:26:24.994
lots of people, and do any amount of harm
to others.

00:26:24.994 --> 00:26:28.244
I would look at the picture of Hitler.

00:26:28.244 --> 00:26:33.405
For nine years this fellow was watching what
wrongs Jews are doing.

00:26:33.405 --> 00:26:43.204
He wouldn’t watch what Germans are doing,
what wrong they are doing to the society.

00:26:43.204 --> 00:26:49.825
And that time the society also was very bad,
because they were having all kinds of licentiousness.

00:26:49.825 --> 00:26:56.874
Now he was noting down, “These Jews are
like this, they do this, they take money,

00:26:56.874 --> 00:27:01.655
they - lending money,” all kinds of things
he got into his head.

00:27:01.655 --> 00:27:08.405
As a result of that he built up a reaction
into him that “We must somehow or another

00:27:08.405 --> 00:27:13.765
see that these people go away from Germany.”

00:27:13.765 --> 00:27:19.775
But then he thought, “Even if they go away
from Germany, they’ll prosper again.

00:27:19.775 --> 00:27:21.234
So why not kill them?”

00:27:21.234 --> 00:27:29.395
I mean, to such an extent that even, you know,
you cannot see such films, you cannot see

00:27:29.395 --> 00:27:32.864
anything of that nature that Hitler did.

00:27:32.864 --> 00:27:40.864
But he did it, and people who followed him
also did it without feeling any hitch, as

00:27:40.864 --> 00:27:48.305
if it was a matter of great pleasure or a
joy, or maybe it’s a duty.

00:27:48.305 --> 00:27:54.474
How could they get duty bound to such a horrible
thing like killing thousands and thousands

00:27:54.474 --> 00:27:57.665
of Jews?

00:27:57.665 --> 00:28:01.915
What Jews had done to them, they could have
corrected it.

00:28:01.915 --> 00:28:05.175
But why did they indulge into such violence?

00:28:05.175 --> 00:28:09.185
And they wanted to finish all the Jews of
the world.

00:28:09.185 --> 00:28:17.454
It can be very, very dangerous, because once
you start losing your witness state you can

00:28:17.454 --> 00:28:22.364
fall into negative collectivity.

00:28:22.364 --> 00:28:29.464
And thus this negative collectivity acts,
acts in such a bad manner that all the conflicts

00:28:29.464 --> 00:28:36.734
of the world, all the problems of the world
perhaps are related with this.

00:28:36.734 --> 00:28:47.324
So as Sahaja Yogis, what should we do?

00:28:47.324 --> 00:28:58.204
We should not react, we should not react.

00:28:58.204 --> 00:29:07.594
If you see something wrong, all right, you
meditate on that point, you meditate.

00:29:07.594 --> 00:29:16.464
If you find anything wrong happening, all
right, meditate on that.

00:29:16.464 --> 00:29:21.594
If somebody is unkind to you, at that moment
do not react.

00:29:21.594 --> 00:29:30.864
Afterwards when that person is quietened,
you tell him or tell her, because at that

00:29:30.864 --> 00:29:36.585
time when he’s so volatile or she’s volatile
if you tell, nothing will happen.

00:29:36.585 --> 00:29:43.984
Gradually, I don’t say always you can win
over such people, but gradually you may be

00:29:43.984 --> 00:29:52.795
able to make them understand that it’s wrong,
it’s wrong to do things which they have

00:29:52.795 --> 00:29:54.515
been doing.

00:29:54.515 --> 00:30:06.574
In a way, you see, the reaction to anything
which is stupid also can be very self-destroying.

00:30:06.574 --> 00:30:11.385
Like some people have built-in reactions,
like you have seen this Mr. Clinton behaving.

00:30:11.385 --> 00:30:18.545
I mean, you can’t understand a man of his
stature, of his level should have such reactions,

00:30:18.545 --> 00:30:25.545
but must be from his childhood or I don’t
know how he built it up.

00:30:25.545 --> 00:30:29.614
Now he is in trouble, and very shameful.

00:30:29.614 --> 00:30:41.535
This also is, I think perhaps comes from a
very great indulgence into reactions.

00:30:41.535 --> 00:30:48.854
Why should you react to a woman, I can’t
understand, or to a man?

00:30:48.854 --> 00:30:55.785
And this is one of the biggest problems of
today’s culture, specially in all the developed

00:30:55.785 --> 00:31:02.234
countries, that all the time men are looking
at women, women are looking at men.

00:31:02.234 --> 00:31:04.015
For what?

00:31:04.015 --> 00:31:08.925
Perhaps they look at women because they want
to see how many women are looking at them.

00:31:08.925 --> 00:31:16.815
Or they look at men perhaps may be that how
many men are looking at them.

00:31:16.815 --> 00:31:19.244
Why, why is this happening?

00:31:19.244 --> 00:31:25.655
Because they have some inferiority complex
in them, or that they want to attract the

00:31:25.655 --> 00:31:26.795
attention of everyone.

00:31:26.795 --> 00:31:32.364
I mean, horrible things are done these days
to attract the attention of others, to get

00:31:32.364 --> 00:31:33.895
the sympathy of others.

00:31:33.895 --> 00:31:39.285
I mean, if you see the level of your awareness
where it goes, you’ll be amazed.

00:31:39.285 --> 00:31:46.084
Like they say one lady killed her eight children
just to get sympathy from others.

00:31:46.084 --> 00:31:52.844
But think of such horrible things people are
doing.

00:31:52.844 --> 00:32:06.336
Now if you want others to have reaction you
do this, that they want others to see you

00:32:06.336 --> 00:32:16.194
or to react to you, I don’t know, to give
you importance, you can say.

00:32:16.194 --> 00:32:18.185
But what is the use of such an empty importance?

00:32:18.185 --> 00:32:29.565
But people are seeking, and is a very common
disease of modern life: all the time how you

00:32:29.565 --> 00:32:35.415
should look, how you should appear, how you
should walk.

00:32:35.415 --> 00:32:40.715
Everything is so stupid and wastage of energy.

00:32:40.715 --> 00:32:52.564
God has created human beings very, very different,
none of them are copies, none of them.

00:32:52.564 --> 00:33:01.574
Even in the nature you find the leaves of
trees, they are so unique, you cannot match

00:33:01.574 --> 00:33:05.075
them with another leaf.

00:33:05.075 --> 00:33:08.945
So that’s how human beings are created,
differently.

00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:12.825
They are made like that.

00:33:12.825 --> 00:33:16.415
One has to accept.

00:33:16.415 --> 00:33:18.454
Whatever you are, it’s all right.

00:33:18.454 --> 00:33:22.645
Why do you want to look like another person?

00:33:22.645 --> 00:33:29.485
This kind of reaction is extremely stupid,
I think, that we are spoiling our energy and

00:33:29.485 --> 00:33:35.844
life for something absolutely worthless.

00:33:35.844 --> 00:33:39.724
Now you being Sahaja Yogis, your worth is
great.

00:33:39.724 --> 00:33:51.114
You have come here to emancipate human beings
from these silly ideas and foolish ways, the

00:33:51.114 --> 00:33:54.835
way people are behaving.

00:33:54.835 --> 00:34:01.175
I don’t know whom to blame, but suddenly
our attention has become very diversified,

00:34:01.175 --> 00:34:05.305
our reactions have become very, very funny.

00:34:05.305 --> 00:34:13.435
One doesn’t know why people react like that,
and then why do we worry about what people

00:34:13.435 --> 00:34:14.435
react?

00:34:14.435 --> 00:34:22.955
All these things are not only on individual
level, but also on a collective level.

00:34:22.955 --> 00:34:29.085
As a result, you see, new kinds of value system
has been created.

00:34:29.085 --> 00:34:39.515
Now for a mother, say for example, she’ll
boast of how many men are running after her.

00:34:39.515 --> 00:34:44.225
Or she would think she is a great actress
- I don’t know what they think of themselves.

00:34:44.225 --> 00:34:47.624
And the way they talk about themselves is
something surprising.

00:34:47.624 --> 00:34:55.625
If she’s a mother, she has to be a good
mother and she has to look like a mother.

00:34:55.625 --> 00:35:09.715
But they are so much engrossed or they are
so much standing on the basis that they have

00:35:09.715 --> 00:35:20.865
to be extremely attractive, they have to be
the queens or I don’t know what, what a

00:35:20.865 --> 00:35:22.565
position they want to have.

00:35:22.565 --> 00:35:24.785
Same with the men.

00:35:24.785 --> 00:35:34.885
You see, if you have something within you,
if there is any quality within you, is there

00:35:34.885 --> 00:35:41.385
anything that can qualify you as a great man,
it will be showing.

00:35:41.385 --> 00:35:49.655
You don’t have to advertise, you don’t
have to pamper it, nothing, it will be showing.

00:35:49.655 --> 00:35:59.105
So that indifference if you have towards the
public opinion, I think you can achieve a

00:35:59.105 --> 00:36:00.295
lot.

00:36:00.295 --> 00:36:02.625
Most of the frustrations will disappear.

00:36:02.625 --> 00:36:10.865
In Sahaja Yoga also I have seen people want
to show off a lot.

00:36:10.865 --> 00:36:13.225
I know who does that.

00:36:13.225 --> 00:36:21.855
But they should know, once you do not react
to outside you start reacting to inside, and

00:36:21.855 --> 00:36:28.075
introspection will start properly.

00:36:28.075 --> 00:36:43.085
When you see yourself you’ll be amazed how
admiring you are, how happy you are.

00:36:43.085 --> 00:36:51.835
Now if you go beyond that a little more, then
you don’t think of all these things.

00:36:51.835 --> 00:37:02.895
You just become thoughtless and you just stand
up as a person who is respected, whose company

00:37:02.895 --> 00:37:11.705
is wanted, who is loved and who is cared for.

00:37:11.705 --> 00:37:17.225
So one should not worry as to what people
react, what they say about you, what they

00:37:17.225 --> 00:37:19.725
think about you.

00:37:19.725 --> 00:37:24.415
You should just introspect and see for yourself.

00:37:24.415 --> 00:37:37.945
After some time you don’t need even introspection.

00:37:37.945 --> 00:37:47.545
It is a kind of a state I am talking about,
where Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “I will

00:37:47.545 --> 00:37:52.015
not fight.

00:37:52.015 --> 00:38:02.535
So in between Me and the army, My army, you
have to select.”

00:38:02.535 --> 00:38:06.235
So Kauravas said, “No, we’ll take Your
army, Your army.

00:38:06.235 --> 00:38:13.205
You give us Your army and we’ll strengthen
our army.”

00:38:13.205 --> 00:38:20.725
But Arjuna said, “I don’t want army, I
want You.

00:38:20.725 --> 00:38:26.195
You don’t want to fight, it’s all right.”

00:38:26.195 --> 00:38:35.955
Because though He will be there in a witness
state only, He won’t be fighting but His

00:38:35.955 --> 00:38:38.835
power will act.

00:38:38.835 --> 00:38:48.555
He doesn’t have to fight, He doesn’t have
to do anything, but His own power which is

00:38:48.555 --> 00:38:57.765
outwardly is silent but will act, and that
is how we will win the war.

00:38:57.765 --> 00:39:00.775
So this power of witnessing you all should
develop.

00:39:00.775 --> 00:39:18.025
Try to develop it that when you are reacting,
stop reaction, stop reaction about everything.

00:39:18.025 --> 00:39:24.015
You will be amazed, you will find yourself
a very, very powerful person in the sense

00:39:24.015 --> 00:39:32.935
you’ll have no ambitions, you’ll have
no desires, you’ll have no special fondness

00:39:32.935 --> 00:39:35.395
or anything.

00:39:35.395 --> 00:39:38.975
But just you are witnessing the drama.

00:39:38.975 --> 00:39:46.706
It’s very interesting to witness also, because
then you understand the humor behind everything,

00:39:46.706 --> 00:39:52.035
you understand the stupidity behind everything.

00:39:52.035 --> 00:40:04.375
You understand also how people have been so
violent, and you just laugh at it; you don’t

00:40:04.375 --> 00:40:10.265
get upset, excited, nothing, just laugh at
it.

00:40:10.265 --> 00:40:17.415
After some time you’ll be amazed, your witness
state will increase, and when in the collective

00:40:17.415 --> 00:40:28.636
all of you have that witness state, you can
do wonders without doing anything, without

00:40:28.636 --> 00:40:35.975
saying anything, without acting - only your
presence itself can work it out.

00:40:35.975 --> 00:40:41.825
I don’t say that it will have effect on
everyone, no, can’t say; but most of the

00:40:41.825 --> 00:40:45.175
people.

00:40:45.175 --> 00:40:56.335
Any person who is in that state, he is the
one who brings peace, he brings joy.

00:40:56.335 --> 00:41:06.175
I’ll tell you a story of a Sahaja Yogi who
was going to another island - he was living

00:41:06.175 --> 00:41:14.935
in an island - for Sahaja Yoga work, and he
found the whole sky was covered with very

00:41:14.935 --> 00:41:17.705
black clouds, thundering clouds.

00:41:17.705 --> 00:41:25.865
So he just looked at them like this and he
said, “Wait till I come back.

00:41:25.865 --> 00:41:30.355
I am going to do Mother’s work.”

00:41:30.355 --> 00:41:41.175
He went to another island, he did the program,
everything happened and when he came back

00:41:41.175 --> 00:41:50.875
he wanted to sleep, and suddenly it started
raining and thundering.

00:41:50.875 --> 00:41:53.575
Even the nature understands.

00:41:53.575 --> 00:42:00.335
Nature understands that you are in that great
state of witnessing.

00:42:00.335 --> 00:42:07.575
But if you are very ambitious - even in Sahaja
Yoga I have known people who are very ambitious,

00:42:07.575 --> 00:42:11.685
they want to become leaders, I don’t know
what else.

00:42:11.685 --> 00:42:13.715
Actually, it’s all a myth.

00:42:13.715 --> 00:42:21.095
All mythical things they want to get to, and
worry their heads about mythical things.

00:42:21.095 --> 00:42:27.985
Once you learn how to witness you will know
the myth, you will know the absurdity, you

00:42:27.985 --> 00:42:30.255
will know the maya.

00:42:30.255 --> 00:42:42.555
So to overcome the problems of personality
the best thing is to witness, practice witnessing

00:42:42.555 --> 00:42:52.675
everything: before talking, practice witnessing,
before giving any comments, just start witnessing.

00:42:52.675 --> 00:42:56.755
It’s a very, very satisfying attitude.

00:42:56.755 --> 00:43:11.845
In Shri Krishna’s life the greatest power
He was, a witnessing personality.

00:43:11.845 --> 00:43:23.025
Without doing anything, without taking a sword
in His hands, without talking about fighting,

00:43:23.025 --> 00:43:33.765
He is the One who has helped Pandavas to win
the war.

00:43:33.765 --> 00:43:43.515
Not only, but through His “Gita” He has
tried to tell us what we have to do to win

00:43:43.515 --> 00:43:46.595
the war over evil.

00:43:46.595 --> 00:43:54.865
Whole “Gita” is the witness state He’s
described about.

00:43:54.865 --> 00:44:01.225
If you read it “Gita” now from this angle,
you’ll be amazed to find that everywhere

00:44:01.225 --> 00:44:07.595
He is like a witness describing everything,
whatever He sees.

00:44:07.595 --> 00:44:19.065
And He will tell you how, how this witness
state has helped Him to understand also human

00:44:19.065 --> 00:44:20.065
beings.

00:44:20.065 --> 00:44:29.465
He is a man who was, we should say, was not
such a big businessman; because first He told

00:44:29.465 --> 00:44:32.515
you that how to become sthita pragnya.

00:44:32.515 --> 00:44:38.845
“Sthita pragnya” is the one who is in
the witness state.

00:44:38.845 --> 00:44:46.435
If you see all these verses on sthita pragnya,
is nothing but a person who is in a witness

00:44:46.435 --> 00:44:53.875
state: how he lives, how he is happy, how
he looks at things.

00:44:53.875 --> 00:44:56.805
It’s interesting, very interesting.

00:44:56.805 --> 00:45:03.015
First He describes that, not like the sharp
people who will describe first the bad things,

00:45:03.015 --> 00:45:05.555
but He starts with the best.

00:45:05.555 --> 00:45:16.305
Then He goes down to other things and tell
you that whatever are the three aspects.

00:45:16.305 --> 00:45:22.955
The first He talks about karma, and many people
get stuck at that point, that “Whatever

00:45:22.955 --> 00:45:26.945
karmas we are doing, we’ll get the punyas
out of it.”

00:45:26.945 --> 00:45:30.135
But He is not.

00:45:30.135 --> 00:45:33.335
He didn’t say that.

00:45:33.335 --> 00:45:37.355
If you know Him, then you will know He never
meant that.

00:45:37.355 --> 00:45:48.235
What He says, that “Whatever karmas you
have to do, you can do it, but leave the results

00:45:48.235 --> 00:45:51.085
to the Divine Power.”

00:45:51.085 --> 00:45:58.235
Results are from the Divine Power.

00:45:58.235 --> 00:46:06.965
Now may be that some people think that they
have got money because they have done good

00:46:06.965 --> 00:46:14.355
karmas, and start doing all kinds of bad karmas
with that money.

00:46:14.355 --> 00:46:15.685
He didn’t say that.

00:46:15.685 --> 00:46:20.375
He said, “Leave the results to the Divine
Power.”

00:46:20.375 --> 00:46:26.435
Because Divine Power knows best what is for
you.

00:46:26.435 --> 00:46:32.525
And so if you think you have done something
good, you have served somewhere to the poor,

00:46:32.525 --> 00:46:42.005
you have done something really good for the
women or anything; the result of that, you

00:46:42.005 --> 00:46:53.175
leave it at the feet of the Divine Power - means
that you don’t build up an ego for whatever

00:46:53.175 --> 00:46:55.495
you have done.

00:46:55.495 --> 00:47:01.685
Though very well He has written this, but
to understand Him one should have again the

00:47:01.685 --> 00:47:07.945
witness state to see what He has written about
karma.

00:47:07.945 --> 00:47:10.155
Then He has written about gnyana.

00:47:10.155 --> 00:47:14.525
Gnyana means “where you know.”

00:47:14.525 --> 00:47:21.105
But that doesn’t mean you go on reading
books, never.

00:47:21.105 --> 00:47:29.595
Gnyana means to know what you are.

00:47:29.595 --> 00:47:43.085
That means you have to be a Sahaja Yogi, by
which you know so many things through vibrations.

00:47:43.085 --> 00:47:49.045
Gnyana doesn’t mean reading books.

00:47:49.045 --> 00:47:54.365
By reading books you become more ignorant.

00:47:54.365 --> 00:48:03.005
So gnyana means that you must know yourself.

00:48:03.005 --> 00:48:07.165
If you do not know yourself, you do not know
anything.

00:48:07.165 --> 00:48:13.125
So it comes to, that you must get your Self
Realization.

00:48:13.125 --> 00:48:14.575
You must know yourself.

00:48:14.575 --> 00:48:16.965
It’s the second thing He has said.

00:48:16.965 --> 00:48:20.195
Lastly, He talks about bhakti.

00:48:20.195 --> 00:48:25.795
Bhakti is devotion.

00:48:25.795 --> 00:48:29.975
That too is another trick of Shri Krishna,
the way He describes bhakti.

00:48:29.975 --> 00:48:36.875
Now you find people on the street, “Hare
Rama, Hare Krishna” singing.

00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:42.695
In one word He is concluded: He says, “You
must do ananya bhakti.”

00:48:42.695 --> 00:48:46.995
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

00:48:46.995 --> 00:48:54.275
That means when you have submerged yourself
into the Divine, you are one with the Divine,

00:48:54.275 --> 00:48:59.505
then you should do bhakti, otherwise I do
not accept.

00:48:59.505 --> 00:49:13.505
He says that “If you give Me some leaves
or some fruits or some flowers, I will accept,

00:49:13.505 --> 00:49:23.475
I will accept,” but for Him the real bhakti
is only possible when you become one with

00:49:23.475 --> 00:49:30.675
the Divine; otherwise it’s just a show.

00:49:30.675 --> 00:49:35.805
So the third bhakti part also comes after
Self Realization.

00:49:35.805 --> 00:49:48.365
Now in the bhakti you see there is no “what
is the value is and how much you’ve paid

00:49:48.365 --> 00:49:51.825
for it, and how you bought it”- it’s not
important.

00:49:51.825 --> 00:50:01.875
For that, a great example is of Shri Rama
when He went in the jungles.

00:50:01.875 --> 00:50:13.995
There was a old lady from the schedules caste,
means she was one of the Bhilini as they call

00:50:13.995 --> 00:50:18.045
it, these people live in the jungles.

00:50:18.045 --> 00:50:25.685
So she brought some berries and offered it
to Shri Ram.

00:50:25.685 --> 00:50:34.515
And she said that “I have tasted all of
them and they are not sour, all of them I

00:50:34.515 --> 00:50:36.095
have tasted.”

00:50:36.095 --> 00:50:44.675
Now after tasting something in India, people
call it, is become not to be eaten.

00:50:44.675 --> 00:50:49.635
I mean, we cannot taste something and give
it to somebody else, it’s not done according

00:50:49.635 --> 00:50:51.085
to Indian culture.

00:50:51.085 --> 00:50:53.495
But Shri Rama took it.

00:50:53.495 --> 00:50:57.345
He took it and said, “What beautiful fruits!

00:50:57.345 --> 00:51:02.945
I’ve never eaten such fruits!”

00:51:02.945 --> 00:51:04.585
So Lakshmana got very angry.

00:51:04.585 --> 00:51:10.015
He said, “You stupid woman, you have eaten
these fruits and that’s what you are giving

00:51:10.015 --> 00:51:11.205
to Shri Ram.

00:51:11.205 --> 00:51:14.925
Why did you do that?”

00:51:14.925 --> 00:51:21.445
So Sita was watching, so She asked Him, “Why
don’t You give Me some of these fruits?”

00:51:21.445 --> 00:51:22.795
He gave.

00:51:22.795 --> 00:51:27.255
She said, “My God, what nice fruits these
are!

00:51:27.255 --> 00:51:30.295
I have never eaten such good fruits.”

00:51:30.295 --> 00:51:35.235
So then Lakshmana also, His temper came down
and He said, “Can You not give Me some?”

00:51:35.235 --> 00:51:36.345
She said, “Why?

00:51:36.345 --> 00:51:39.665
You were so angry, why should I give You?”

00:51:39.665 --> 00:51:42.025
Ultimately She gives Him that fruit.

00:51:42.025 --> 00:51:43.575
So what did He see in those fruits?

00:51:43.575 --> 00:51:56.745
It was the love, the love of this old lady
living in the forest, her love which was important.

00:51:56.745 --> 00:52:03.175
So when you want to give something also it
is your love which is important, not how much

00:52:03.175 --> 00:52:06.165
you paid, what value you have spent, nothing.

00:52:06.165 --> 00:52:13.545
It’s the love with which you do it, and
that love should be evident.

00:52:13.545 --> 00:52:22.615
If such things can happen, even with Shri
Krishna the same thing happened.

00:52:22.615 --> 00:52:32.325
He went to - they called it Hastinapur in
those days, where these Kauravas were ruling.

00:52:32.325 --> 00:52:36.956
And the king was Duryodhana, and he asked
Him, “You come and stay with us and have

00:52:36.956 --> 00:52:37.956
food.”

00:52:37.956 --> 00:52:40.885
He said, “No, no, I won’t be able to come.”

00:52:40.885 --> 00:52:48.295
He goes to another person, Vidhura, who was
the son of a maidservant; Vidhura, because

00:52:48.295 --> 00:52:51.885
Vidhura was a realized soul.

00:52:51.885 --> 00:52:59.065
He was a realized soul, so He went and ate
in his house, where he had cooked very simple

00:52:59.065 --> 00:53:00.065
food.

00:53:00.065 --> 00:53:06.125
Because he was a realized soul, to Him he
was the best to have food with.

00:53:06.125 --> 00:53:14.395
So your value system should be based on such
things like love.

00:53:14.395 --> 00:53:19.735
Where you can get love, you should be attached
to that person.

00:53:19.735 --> 00:53:26.135
Where you get a realized soul, you should
be attached to them and not to worldly people

00:53:26.135 --> 00:53:29.855
who think no end of themselves, and think
that they are great.

00:53:29.855 --> 00:53:39.095
They may be, but to you as Sahaja Yogis it’s
the love of people which should be respected,

00:53:39.095 --> 00:53:43.705
should be understood and to be felt.

00:53:43.705 --> 00:53:48.885
But if you have no witness state, then you
will see how much money this man has got,

00:53:48.885 --> 00:53:57.535
how many cars he has got, what clothes he’s
wearing, all these considerations will be

00:53:57.535 --> 00:53:58.535
there.

00:53:58.535 --> 00:54:03.705
But in a witness state, you will understand
that you will get vibrations from this person,

00:54:03.705 --> 00:54:08.855
you will understand that person is spiritual.

00:54:09.105 --> 00:54:18.145
And that’s how you will stick to such a
person, you will not go for artificial things,

00:54:18.145 --> 00:54:21.624
but the genuine personalities that are there.

00:54:22.003 --> 00:54:23.554
May God bless you all.

00:54:24.253 --> 00:54:25.253
Thank you.

00:54:49.007 --> 00:54:56.027
Today they have decided to read some of the
names Sahaja Yogis have got with them, and

00:54:56.077 --> 00:55:06.347
they want to distribute, they have distributed
these names to you.

00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:11.480
So somebody will read those names of Shri
Krishna.

00:55:11.497 --> 00:55:17.210
Now just imagine with witness state all these
powers that are described of Shri Krishna,

00:55:17.244 --> 00:55:22.654
how they will act and how they will work through
you.
