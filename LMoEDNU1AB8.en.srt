1
00:00:04,023 --> 00:00:07,598
Welcome to you all.

2
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:31,083
It has been little bit delayed but just
now they have informed Me that

3
00:00:31,284 --> 00:00:36,102
the plane is delayed even much more, so I
thought it’s better to have the puja now,

4
00:00:36,303 --> 00:00:38,775
though the English had told us that
they would like

5
00:00:38,976 --> 00:00:41,491
to attend from the very beginning.

6
00:00:41,692 --> 00:00:46,425
They always get many more pujas,
that may be the reason.

7
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:05,627
So now we have all arrived here and we
are going to start this pilgrimage

8
00:01:06,921 --> 00:01:13,895
of travelling together.

9
00:01:16,554 --> 00:01:28,334
The journey is of a very subtle nature

10
00:01:28,987 --> 00:01:36,396
and, if we realize why we are here,
we’ll understand

11
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:46,298
that all this Creation is watching you all

12
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:53,185
and it’s trying to help you that you
should ascend

13
00:01:53,386 --> 00:02:00,576
and that you feel your depth and thus
enjoy your Self.

14
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:07,671
The travel may not be very comfortable.

15
00:02:07,893 --> 00:02:16,038
The roads are

16
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:28,120
so very filled with speed-breakers

17
00:02:28,469 --> 00:02:33,809
and all kinds of obstructions.

18
00:02:34,356 --> 00:02:39,950
Is a journey like of our ascent I felt,

19
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:46,621
that our speed has to be brought down.

20
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:54,916
In the West we have become very speedy,
no doubt,

21
00:02:55,117 --> 00:03:03,388
and to bring down this speed we have to use

22
00:03:07,515 --> 00:03:18,364
meditative process that we feel our peace
within ourselves.

23
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:28,916
Also the thoughts are bombarding our minds

24
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:37,217
and we react very fast

25
00:03:41,371 --> 00:03:45,973
to others and to these thoughts.

26
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:52,757
So one has to be aware,

27
00:03:54,419 --> 00:04:01,521
one has to be knowing what is happening
within yourself,

28
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:09,656
that the thoughts are bombarding you,

29
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:15,090
you are trying to ascend

30
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:24,427
and you find it very difficult to get rid
of the thoughts.

31
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,465
The thought process can start

32
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:39,490
by your conditioning or by your ego –
only two problems.

33
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:52,203
And you are the one who is under
the challenge.

34
00:04:57,089 --> 00:05:01,783
So you have got these simple people
in the village

35
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:12,308
who start watching everything but
they do not react.

36
00:05:13,265 --> 00:05:20,252
If you do not react then your thoughts
will give up.

37
00:05:22,212 --> 00:05:32,216
So the first thing should be to watch
yourself that you are not reacting,

38
00:05:34,758 --> 00:05:42,168
but you are experiencing and enjoying
the silence,

39
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:49,668
the subtleties, the beauty, the glory

40
00:05:49,869 --> 00:05:56,405
of your being as well as whatever is
around you.

41
00:05:58,779 --> 00:06:03,945
You don’t have to force yourself to break
this habit,

42
00:06:06,853 --> 00:06:11,278
but just to be on the watch-out.

43
00:06:13,898 --> 00:06:20,057
It’s not necessary to talk too much
about it also,

44
00:06:23,779 --> 00:06:27,383
nor it is necessary

45
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:36,369
to think about anything.

46
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:42,908
Because supposing you see a tree –
so it’s a tree only.

47
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:46,679
What are we going to think about it?

48
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,313
And whatever we may think about it,
it’s going to be the tree!

49
00:06:55,128 --> 00:07:00,724
So there’s no harm in appearing little bit
stupid – doesn’t matter.

50
00:07:00,925 --> 00:07:07,660
But this is the basic thing, is, that when
we start analyzing,

51
00:07:07,861 --> 00:07:13,067
we are breaking our own nerves,

52
00:07:13,464 --> 00:07:21,503
and poisoning our own mind and brain.

53
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:33,237
So to watch something without analysis,
without thinking about it, is reality.

54
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:40,680
If you can achieve that point where
you watch everything

55
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:45,615
without reacting, you are in reality,

56
00:07:50,717 --> 00:08:01,837
and then only the penetration into
the subtleties of your surroundings,

57
00:08:02,038 --> 00:08:07,019
of your relationships, your friendships

58
00:08:09,632 --> 00:08:16,236
the whole universe, dawns upon you.

59
00:08:19,383 --> 00:08:23,567
That’s why I’ve said that in this
pilgrimage

60
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:31,828
the first thing we have to remember [is]
that we have to be aware ourselves.

61
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:36,731
But when you are only thinking about
others,

62
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:40,615
how others have to behave: “They should
do like this!” -

63
00:08:40,816 --> 00:08:47,905
that leave it to your leaders to break
their heads, that’s not your job.

64
00:08:48,508 --> 00:08:53,646
It’s a headache for them I know, but they
have to do it, it’s all right.

65
00:08:53,847 --> 00:08:59,305
But why do you want to break your heads
for nothing at all?

66
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:05,224
So to judge others, to think of others,

67
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:11,342
what they are doing, what’s wrong
with them,

68
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:22,988
about anything whatsoever you may think
is wrong – is not going to be corrected.

69
00:09:24,022 --> 00:09:29,064
Like I know some people who are specially
bureaucrats,

70
00:09:29,265 --> 00:09:33,529
they are travelling, supposing, by the car.

71
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:41,236
Then they will say, “I think, you see,
this road should have gone this way”,

72
00:09:41,437 --> 00:09:46,358
or “I think it would have been nice if this
house was facing the other way” –

73
00:09:46,559 --> 00:09:53,822
but it’s not, you see? It is not going
to face [that way].

74
00:09:54,235 --> 00:10:01,733
It is going to be the way it is, so what is
the use of wasting your brain,

75
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:11,322
your mind, your thought, in suggesting
something which doesn’t work out,

76
00:10:11,523 --> 00:10:15,171
and never going to work out either.

77
00:10:16,411 --> 00:10:20,443
So when we start like, “I think

78
00:10:21,184 --> 00:10:27,365
these trees should have been little
taller” – but they are not!

79
00:10:29,774 --> 00:10:32,339
“I think

80
00:10:36,977 --> 00:10:44,837
that the crows should stop their noise” –
they will not.

81
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:53,791
So just accept it. Acceptance is the way

82
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,960
we are going to enjoy. But acceptance
doesn’t mean tolerance,

83
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:07,367
because tolerance means you have
to work very hard

84
00:11:07,568 --> 00:11:11,522
to accept that the trees are of the same
height –

85
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:14,748
they can’t grow – it’s too much for you.

86
00:11:14,949 --> 00:11:21,129
When you say, “I have to tolerate it,
you see, because my mind doesn’t accept.”

87
00:11:27,217 --> 00:11:33,714
So acceptance as it is whatever you see,
acceptance.

88
00:11:34,119 --> 00:11:38,043
And that is how people grow I have seen,
those who start accepting.

89
00:11:38,244 --> 00:11:45,654
That’s the sign. That’s the sign of their
strength and their depth.

90
00:11:45,855 --> 00:11:52,940
Like the propensity of this Mother Earth,
She is what She is.

91
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:02,419
And She bears whatever is there.

92
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:14,032
If you put a heavy thing on Her, She’ll put
equal and opposite force and bear it.

93
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:20,156
She doesn’t say, “I’m tolerating it,
I am exerting any pressure”.

94
00:12:20,357 --> 00:12:23,782
But She is just accepting.

95
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:33,125
So the witnessing and awareness develops

96
00:12:33,326 --> 00:12:38,720
when we start just accepting things
as they are.

97
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:43,804
“I think” doesn’t work out.

98
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:52,527
“I think it would have been better like
this” doesn’t work out.

99
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:59,949
Then second problem is “I like”.

100
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:09,300
Now, “I like to eat a cake” - but there is
no cake, what to do?

101
00:13:11,655 --> 00:13:16,585
Now, whatever is there, enjoy it as a cake.

102
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:25,545
But if you go on thinking like that –
“I like whatever is not here” –

103
00:13:25,746 --> 00:13:30,367
you can never be happy, as simple as that.

104
00:13:30,568 --> 00:13:38,241
You have to say, “I like whatever is there.

105
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:45,430
I enjoy whatever is there”. Then that’s
the reality.

106
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:53,339
Whatever doesn’t exist, if you like it,

107
00:13:55,838 --> 00:13:59,512
so what can anybody do about it?

108
00:14:03,203 --> 00:14:09,726
It works out in so many ways, in so many
facets in life,

109
00:14:09,927 --> 00:14:18,451
that advantage is taken by people because
we become so vulnerable

110
00:14:18,652 --> 00:14:24,052
to our likes and dislikes that
the entrepreneurs take over

111
00:14:24,253 --> 00:14:30,893
and they create likes and dislikes
in our heads, and put ideas every day.

112
00:14:31,094 --> 00:14:34,181
I’ve seen it now, how they do it,

113
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:38,558
through television, through newspapers,
through this, that.

114
00:14:38,759 --> 00:14:42,922
So then you say, “Now, I like this”.

115
00:14:44,146 --> 00:14:48,038
But from where this liking has come

116
00:14:48,247 --> 00:14:53,406
is the conditioning which is put
into your head.

117
00:14:56,881 --> 00:15:02,610
So you are a slave of that conditioning.

118
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:15,110
“I only like roses and I don’t like
any other flower”.

119
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:23,131
But why? Why you don’t like any
other flower?

120
00:15:27,866 --> 00:15:36,344
And for such things whatever we have
we miss the joy.

121
00:15:39,617 --> 00:15:47,522
So the second part should be that,
“Enjoy everything.”

122
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:54,323
“Why am I here?

123
00:15:58,278 --> 00:16:07,941
It’s not a very comfortable place
by any chance, so why am I here?”

124
00:16:11,792 --> 00:16:16,013
To enjoy each other.

125
00:16:18,702 --> 00:16:22,342
To enjoy your own being.

126
00:16:22,543 --> 00:16:30,950
The more divergence you have outside,
appealing to your ego and conditioning,

127
00:16:31,151 --> 00:16:35,834
the more your mind is busy with that,

128
00:16:38,978 --> 00:16:46,974
then you cannot enjoy anything.

129
00:16:50,062 --> 00:16:54,975
So come to the other conditioning which
is very subtle

130
00:16:56,572 --> 00:17:02,847
that, “I’m an Englishman”, or
“I’m an American”,

131
00:17:03,048 --> 00:17:14,099
or maybe even “I’m from Derbyshire”,
and then “I’m from another shire”,

132
00:17:15,461 --> 00:17:19,508
and then “better form a group”.

133
00:17:22,337 --> 00:17:25,928
The grouping starts.

134
00:17:26,698 --> 00:17:33,984
In a subtle way it is a kind
of an insecurity.

135
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,811
So we start clubbing.

136
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:47,870
Animals do that very often, they have
to do it

137
00:17:48,071 --> 00:17:52,636
because their sense of insecurity
is quite a lot.

138
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:57,556
And then human beings also do it -

139
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:03,315
but not the saints, not the angels.

140
00:18:03,688 --> 00:18:08,933
They don’t form [groups] because they have
no nationality.

141
00:18:10,279 --> 00:18:14,399
Nationality is also a conditioning.

142
00:18:16,943 --> 00:18:22,783
They don’t belong to any one place,
to any one country.

143
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:28,295
So now those who have come by plane,
had to come,

144
00:18:28,496 --> 00:18:34,707
because from every country there’s
one plane by which they come,

145
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:42,855
must know one thing – that now we have
landed,

146
00:18:43,056 --> 00:18:51,121
and we are all Sahaj Yogis here,
and forget your countries.

147
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:59,566
Forget them and mix up with other people.

148
00:18:59,767 --> 00:19:05,929
Please do not form groups. There is no need
at all to form groups.

149
00:19:06,130 --> 00:19:13,833
So I would request you that in the buses,
because it starts from the airport

150
00:19:14,034 --> 00:19:19,904
you start forming groups and it continues
till the end you go back.

151
00:19:20,105 --> 00:19:27,521
I think it would be a nice idea to break
that, and let people sit

152
00:19:27,722 --> 00:19:36,009
together of different countries and
different nationalities.

153
00:19:36,210 --> 00:19:40,736
And talk to each other, try to know
about each other,

154
00:19:40,937 --> 00:19:43,676
try to find out about each other.

155
00:19:43,877 --> 00:19:50,260
Not just what you know from the newspaper,

156
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:56,164
but the different problems of Sahaja Yoga,

157
00:19:56,365 --> 00:20:00,080
what are the problems of Sahaja Yoga
in a particular country,

158
00:20:00,289 --> 00:20:04,358
what happens in a particular country.

159
00:20:06,303 --> 00:20:14,820
The worst of all is the conditioning
of reading also.

160
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:27,668
Reading without light is useless,

161
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:33,066
and some people still have a habit

162
00:20:33,389 --> 00:20:39,355
of remembering something they have read

163
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:45,386
and a kind of a show-off as they say.

164
00:20:47,756 --> 00:20:56,285
Is better to listen to others.
Let others talk.

165
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:05,439
In Sahaja Yoga on what subject
you’ll discuss?

166
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:10,926
I don’t know, how can you discuss
on anything?

167
00:21:11,127 --> 00:21:18,429
Now you see this one as a green thing.

168
00:21:19,725 --> 00:21:23,073
Now, what can you discuss on this?

169
00:21:23,274 --> 00:21:28,794
You will say, “All right, it’s green, but…
there is so”.

170
00:21:28,995 --> 00:21:34,167
Then another one says, “No, this is green,
but…”.

171
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,705
One may go on like that, madly.

172
00:21:40,363 --> 00:21:44,746
There is no need to discuss in Sahaja Yoga.

173
00:21:44,947 --> 00:21:48,148
I just don’t know what are we going
to discuss. You know everything,

174
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:52,248
you know how Kundalini rises, you know
how chakras are cleared out,

175
00:21:52,449 --> 00:21:56,552
you know how you get realization,
you all know who’s, who catches,

176
00:21:56,753 --> 00:22:02,321
what, and you know that how it affects.

177
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:08,987
Now, if that is the fact, if that is
the truth, that is what it is,

178
00:22:09,188 --> 00:22:13,096
what are we going to discuss about it?

179
00:22:13,962 --> 00:22:17,346
Discussions are over now.

180
00:22:18,191 --> 00:22:25,135
You are gnostics, you are knowledgeable
people. You have the knowledge.

181
00:22:25,435 --> 00:22:30,217
But the knowledge that you have is shared
by everyone of you.

182
00:22:30,418 --> 00:22:35,620
At the most, you can talk about
your experiences,

183
00:22:35,821 --> 00:22:44,900
you can talk about your relationships,
how you have enjoyed.

184
00:22:45,736 --> 00:22:49,950
But there is nothing to discuss
in Sahaja Yoga.

185
00:22:50,151 --> 00:22:54,585
I’ve heard about people who are discussing.

186
00:22:55,157 --> 00:23:00,075
I just don’t know how can there be
a discussion about Sahaja Yoga.

187
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:03,728
I would be very happy to know, if you can
tell Me,

188
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,710
how we can discuss about Sahaja Yoga.

189
00:23:12,829 --> 00:23:18,371
So we have to remember that whatever
we talk, we should talk

190
00:23:18,572 --> 00:23:25,529
about our experiences, about our enjoyments,
our happiness, everything.

191
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:34,341
And not to discuss it and analyze it,
because that would kill the joy completely.

192
00:23:36,152 --> 00:23:39,571
There’s no joy in it.

193
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:44,380
Discussion is just trying to show that
you know better than the other,

194
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:51,019
or you can give another opinion. In Sahaja
Yoga there is no another opinion.

195
00:23:51,519 --> 00:23:58,621
If somebody has a Nabhi, he has a Nabhi,
what another opinion you can have?

196
00:24:01,484 --> 00:24:10,530
So then we finish with different kinds
of arguments and discussions and things.

197
00:24:10,731 --> 00:24:17,146
Maybe somebody goes off the track, maybe.

198
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:23,108
But you all know he is going off the track,
so what’s the use of discussing it?

199
00:24:23,806 --> 00:24:27,174
You all know what he is talking is off
the track, so it’s all right.

200
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:30,886
You come to the conclusion, “Yeah, we know,
we know, we know”.

201
00:24:31,087 --> 00:24:37,073
But to discuss it out, there is no need.

202
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:43,374
Once you know and it is in your awareness,
the Paramchaitanya will take care of it

203
00:24:43,575 --> 00:24:47,465
and you won’t have to bother at all

204
00:24:47,666 --> 00:24:52,805
how to correct, how to mend it, what to do.

205
00:24:53,847 --> 00:25:01,163
That’s not your work. You just leave it
to Paramchaitanya and it will work out.

206
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,249
So here we have come because this country
has been very much blessed

207
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:16,196
by so many saints and yogis, and you can
see it in the people how they are.

208
00:25:17,213 --> 00:25:22,098
And that’s why, despite all poverty,
despite all kinds of discomforts,

209
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:31,583
and despite the fact that they have not
known any Western great things,

210
00:25:31,784 --> 00:25:35,827
they are not bothered.

211
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,268
I went to Russia, of course Russia was
great and so many got realization.

212
00:25:43,469 --> 00:25:50,142
And I was really surprised how these people
have come to Sahaja Yoga

213
00:25:51,632 --> 00:25:59,164
and accepted it. But one part was
very funny,

214
00:25:59,365 --> 00:26:04,123
which was I would say, like the villagers
of this country.

215
00:26:04,324 --> 00:26:11,122
Those who are still not so matured would
not come to Sahaja Yoga as such,

216
00:26:11,323 --> 00:26:17,185
but the difference of their character
was really remarkable,

217
00:26:17,386 --> 00:26:21,937
because - you are going by a taxi.

218
00:26:22,326 --> 00:26:28,395
So the taxi fellow says, “Have you got
a Marlboro cigarette with you?”.

219
00:26:29,834 --> 00:26:32,359
I said, “What is that? I have never
known of it”.

220
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,468
“No, if you have one then we’ll take you
free, or we’ll charge you very little”.

221
00:26:38,669 --> 00:26:41,981
But an Indian will never say such a thing,
he doesn’t know all these things,

222
00:26:42,182 --> 00:26:44,985
he’s not bothered.

223
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:49,232
But if an Indian taxi fellow is going,
he’ll say,

224
00:26:49,433 --> 00:26:53,850
“Have you got a photograph of Mataji
with you?”.

225
00:26:58,905 --> 00:27:01,737
That’s a big difference!

226
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:14,562
In every aspect I have seen that this
another -

227
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:19,543
like there are villagers here, people who
are not Sahaja Yogis,

228
00:27:19,744 --> 00:27:23,573
but they respect, they respect the saint.

229
00:27:23,774 --> 00:27:28,166
To them saint is more important than
anything else.

230
00:27:29,692 --> 00:27:34,768
Nobody will ask you for anything – never!

231
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:39,352
Even if you want to give them, they will
not accept.

232
00:27:41,442 --> 00:27:45,651
They may cheat you, some people who
are selling things,

233
00:27:45,852 --> 00:27:49,868
but they will never ask from you that,
“You give me this, you give me that”,

234
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,770
that’s not done.

235
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:59,579
So the, basically I think there is a
difference which we should understand,

236
00:27:59,951 --> 00:28:09,701
that materialism works much faster
in the West than in India, much faster.

237
00:28:11,225 --> 00:28:18,313
And one has to be careful on that point.
I’m bringing you down to that point now -

238
00:28:19,435 --> 00:28:26,306
that, are we getting lost into materialism?

239
00:28:29,827 --> 00:28:32,267
Of course you know I’m a great shopper,

240
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:37,243
I have to go on shopping, shopping,
shopping, shopping.

241
00:28:37,444 --> 00:28:43,070
And I shop for all of you, and I have been
shopping, no doubt.

242
00:28:44,136 --> 00:28:50,585
But the difference between My shopping
and the shopping of so many is this –

243
00:28:50,786 --> 00:28:54,447
that if I’m shopping I am going there

244
00:28:54,648 --> 00:28:58,728
because I know I’ll get things much
cheaper, much better.

245
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:04,147
All the good things will be there available
because I’m there – I’m sure of that;

246
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:09,861
and all the best qualities will be
available very easily,

247
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:17,870
and that I will be able to get things

248
00:29:18,071 --> 00:29:23,628
for people, because I’ll remember all
of them for whom I have to buy.

249
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,427
It always happens like that.

250
00:29:28,859 --> 00:29:34,679
When I go out for shopping, even if I have
to face four hundred people,

251
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:41,401
I get the things there all right.
That’s why I have to go.

252
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:49,376
All right, if you have to go then you have
to think, “What we are going to buy?”.

253
00:29:49,577 --> 00:29:55,009
I have seen invariably Sahaja Yogis
will buy

254
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:59,110
things for non-Sahaja Yogis, always,
mostly.

255
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:04,504
“I’m buying for my mother, my sister
who is against Sahaja Yoga”.

256
00:30:04,705 --> 00:30:09,414
Why should you buy for somebody who is
against Sahaja Yoga?

257
00:30:09,615 --> 00:30:15,073
Even if they might be your nearest
relations,

258
00:30:16,333 --> 00:30:19,775
do you think they deserve it?

259
00:30:22,184 --> 00:30:28,093
So then we have to know that we are
one body,

260
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:31,620
and as this hand must look after
the other hand,

261
00:30:31,821 --> 00:30:36,029
when we go out shopping or do anything,
we should always think

262
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:41,265
what we are going to buy for other
Sahaja Yogis.

263
00:30:41,466 --> 00:30:44,546
Of course, I have told you that, unless
and until somebody is your sister

264
00:30:44,747 --> 00:30:49,297
by rakhi or anything, you need not give
presents.

265
00:30:50,555 --> 00:30:55,519
But women can buy for women, men can
buy for men.

266
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:59,491
Just understand one small thing –

267
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:03,717
that the matter is for expression
of our love, that’s all.

268
00:31:03,918 --> 00:31:09,209
It has no other meaning. I don’t find
any meaning into it.

269
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:16,313
So instead of buying for… when we,
people travel from here

270
00:31:16,514 --> 00:31:22,060
they go as traders, I’ve seen. Of course
you come as traders also –

271
00:31:22,261 --> 00:31:28,910
but that’s something Dharmic. But when
you go from here you go as traders,

272
00:31:29,111 --> 00:31:32,472
and for whom are you buying?

273
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:40,732
Your relationships are no more with
anybody else but Sahaja Yogis,

274
00:31:40,933 --> 00:31:44,627
and only Sahaja Yogis.

275
00:31:48,221 --> 00:31:51,945
Whether they are Indians,

276
00:31:53,313 --> 00:32:00,637
English, Chinese, Swiss, French, Spanish,

277
00:32:01,417 --> 00:32:13,823
Germans, anything they may think to be,
they are Sahaja Yogis,

278
00:32:14,024 --> 00:32:20,989
and they are born in the land which
we call as the Kingdom of God.

279
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:24,112
So please be careful on this point.

280
00:32:24,313 --> 00:32:29,689
Today being the first day I wanted to
explain to you everything in such a manner

281
00:32:29,890 --> 00:32:32,749
that you remember that we are
on a pilgrimage,

282
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:38,442
and all of us should be able to grow
our awareness.

283
00:32:38,643 --> 00:32:43,624
If you cannot grow your awareness
it is useless.

284
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:52,227
Once you start thinking like that,
you’ll be surprised

285
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:56,860
how much you will gain and how much
you’ll achieve.

286
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:05,806
There are no do’s and don’ts
in Sahaja Yoga, really,

287
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:11,532
and I don’t think we have much disciplining
either, of any kind.

288
00:33:11,733 --> 00:33:16,667
But it is Sahaja Yoga which somehow
or other disciplines you,

289
00:33:16,868 --> 00:33:20,654
I don’t have to tell you anything.
It’s like the fire,

290
00:33:20,855 --> 00:33:25,842
if you put your hand into the fire it will
burn you, whether you like it or not.

291
00:33:26,043 --> 00:33:31,871
In the same way, if you do anything asahaj,
you will have to pay for it.

292
00:33:32,072 --> 00:33:35,617
So you know definitely that you don’t
want to lose your vibrations,

293
00:33:35,818 --> 00:33:39,364
you don’t want to become unhappy.

294
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:44,011
But this time with a very deeper
understanding and reverence

295
00:33:44,212 --> 00:33:50,304
to your Self and to your ascent,

296
00:33:50,505 --> 00:34:04,026
you have to take a very joyful,
serious attitude.

297
00:34:04,543 --> 00:34:11,099
I’m sure this time you all are going
to just enjoy your Self.

298
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,141
May God bless you.
