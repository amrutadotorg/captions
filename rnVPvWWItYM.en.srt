1
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:13,560
I must thank Warren for such a nice speech
that he has given and all the Australians

2
00:00:13,570 --> 00:00:19,910
the way they have taken to Sahaja Yoga. They
are all westernized in every sense of the

3
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:30,970
word. There’s something about them where
I feel that they are very quick at knowing

4
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:46,920
the truth. I don’t know how. They are not
that adamant against the truth. This opening

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:57,829
somehow I found.
Seeking is everywhere very strong I feel America,

6
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:05,449
England, Europe, everywhere the seeking is
very strong no doubt. There are seekers. Of

7
00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:12,890
course there is also a fashion of seeking
apart from that. There are real seekers, no

8
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:24,400
doubt about it. And as he has said that ego
orientation is one of the characters in the

9
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:33,090
West. That also one would say that it is more
now in the developing countries because they

10
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:45,229
are supposed to be developed. But the way
these people have a special capacity to see

11
00:01:45,229 --> 00:01:53,430
the truth, see the truth is a very big thing.
Even if you are a developing country or a

12
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:04,840
developed country, if you cannot perceive
the truth, you cannot assimilate it. That

13
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:13,560
perception some how was surprising, I found
in Australia, was surprising.

14
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:22,830
Now for example in England I worked very hard,
no doubt, years together. People are hard

15
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:30,620
nuts, you can say. Once they are cracked they
are wonderful scholars. They know how to completely

16
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:37,050
sort it out with their brains, everything
is there. But there are very few people who

17
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:42,480
do that.
At the time of Christ you can see how many

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:51,569
could recognize Him? Not even one, not even
one, believe Me. Except for John the Baptist,

19
00:02:51,569 --> 00:02:56,629
of course he was a realized soul. So, I mean
he should not be in the question. The rest

20
00:02:56,629 --> 00:03:03,550
of them were just sticking on to Him somehow,
as He said that you stick on to Me for some

21
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:13,360
time. And till He got His resurrection, they
could not see the truth at all. To perceive

22
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:23,250
it itself is a very big blessing I think.
And I do not know why people cannot perceive

23
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:28,120
it because I cannot go to the other side and
see Myself what’s the problem is?

24
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:37,739
For example in this country or in the West,
on the whole, the false people have come.

25
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:45,959
They have minted money. They have palaces
and they have huge big aircrafts and they

26
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,480
have material things and I mean immense wealth
they have collected out of the people who

27
00:03:53,480 --> 00:04:02,640
are supposed to be westernized. But Sahaja
Yoga, you’ll be amazed even to crack a journalist

28
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:11,239
is a headache. A journalist doesn’t have
time for Me at all. It’s impossible to go

29
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:20,059
and talk to any newspaper person, leave alone
any television or anything like that. Radio

30
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:27,949
is an impossibility. Can you imagine, with
all these facilities God has given you, for

31
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:34,860
spreading the message fast for the wider world?
But it is impossible you can’t talk to them,

32
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:42,599
but let some, say a fake person coming, he’s
there. He’s on the televisions, he’s on

33
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:50,710
the radio, Pope will come and see him. Your
Archbishop of Canterbury will go and touch

34
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:57,719
his feet. And he is a fake, absolute fake.
Why?

35
00:04:57,719 --> 00:05:03,659
Only thing is that we are very money oriented.
They come out with their money. They provide

36
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:10,889
lot of money for publication. They take money
and they use it. I mean if Christ was to be

37
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:16,409
here I tell you He would have no place even
a mike would’ve been difficult for Him being

38
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:23,819
a carpenter’s Son.
Sometimes I find it an impossible situation

39
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:32,800
to tell them that after all how are you impressed
by these people who are taking such a lot

40
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:46,419
of money out of you in the name of God? One
has to think about it that it is so money

41
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:53,369
oriented that any man who comes with money
impresses people. Amazing in the country,

42
00:05:53,369 --> 00:05:59,800
which is so affluent, they are suffering from
affluence, that’s their disease. And there

43
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:09,119
they are impressed by people who are using
money as a purpose of propaganda of God Almighty.

44
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,119
Imagine the absurdity. I don’t know what
happens to their brains?

45
00:06:12,119 --> 00:06:23,789
This time I went to Edinburgh and people told
Me that most of the young people are disciples

46
00:06:23,789 --> 00:06:30,789
of a person who will not even be liked by
the servants of India, take it from Me. Even

47
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:36,649
our servants will take money to go to him.
He doesn’t know good English, even up to

48
00:06:36,649 --> 00:06:43,749
that point you can say. He doesn’t know
anything, how to talk to people. He says he

49
00:06:43,749 --> 00:06:48,990
is fourteen year old which he is not. He’s
married an eight-year-old girl. I mean all

50
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:55,189
kinds of things. He asked for Rolls Royces,
he has fifty-eight, he wanted a fifty ninth

51
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,319
so they starved themselves and collected money
and gave him the 59th. You the English have

52
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:08,669
done it, take it from Me.
Can you believe this stupidity? They have

53
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:11,749
starved themselves and have done it. They
are seekers, seekers of what? Of giving Rolls

54
00:07:11,749 --> 00:07:22,619
Royce to this man? I mean I just can’t understand
how can it go to that stupid level? That’s

55
00:07:22,619 --> 00:07:29,759
what I feel that in Australia people have
not accepted anyone like that. They have not

56
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,569
accepted. They are still you see, they did
this, they did that, He did everything – Warren,

57
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:39,689
[Bah Kari?] this that. He did everything that
is possible under the Sun. They know all the

58
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:46,289
gurus, all the gurus have gone to Australia
and they didn’t accept anyone. That’s

59
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:52,209
the main point. All the time they are shaky
like this and as soon as they saw the truth

60
00:07:52,209 --> 00:08:00,999
they jumped on to it. We have to understand
that Spirit cannot be related to money by

61
00:08:00,999 --> 00:08:08,349
any chance. It has nothing to do.
Christ was a Son of a carpenter. Just think

62
00:08:08,349 --> 00:08:23,679
of that. He, the owner of all the properties
of the world, was born as a poor man. And

63
00:08:23,679 --> 00:08:34,349
how can you relate this to money? I just fail
to understand and this little truth Australians

64
00:08:34,349 --> 00:08:44,500
knew and I wish the English, the Americans
and the Europeans take out their attention

65
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:52,079
from money and the comfort so called that
money gives you. I am sure, I am sure this

66
00:08:52,079 --> 00:08:56,569
country will rise. It has to rise. It has
to rise.

67
00:08:56,569 --> 00:09:03,019
Unless and until England rises, the world
cannot rise. This is a definite thing. Absolutely

68
00:09:03,019 --> 00:09:09,139
it is as definite as anything. England has
to rise first because it is the heart of the

69
00:09:09,139 --> 00:09:15,699
Universe. And the English Sahaja Yogis have
to also awaken to their responsibilities,

70
00:09:15,699 --> 00:09:25,050
which is very important. I will give all My
blood, all My energies, all that is possible

71
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:34,050
under the sun to awaken this country to its
responsibility as a Spiritual nature, as the

72
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:45,910
Spiritual being, as the Spiritual heart, as
the donor of blood, all over. And this is

73
00:09:45,910 --> 00:09:58,959
what saddens Me to see how people are drowning
themselves into some sort of a illusion and

74
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:08,680
are not being able to see the truth.
Now as he has told you, that Sahaja Yoga is

75
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:16,000
fantastic, no doubt about, it because you
are fantastic yourself. You are the Spirit;

76
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,620
you are The Spirit. You have to just become
the Spirit is the point. Once you become the

77
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:30,500
Spirit you are dynamic; not dynamic but you
are the master of everything. You can control

78
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:39,860
things, you can enjoy everything, you become
blissful. You can do such a lot because you

79
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:47,250
are the Spirit and you have become the Spirit.
It is as simple as that. God Almighty has

80
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:55,379
placed this Power within us at the triangular
bone, it exits there.

81
00:10:55,379 --> 00:11:02,629
It has to just rise and give you a real baptism
by which you feel your Spirit first time where

82
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:10,639
it flows like cool breeze in the hand. As
simple as that.

83
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:16,930
Now this happening is a very very strong happening.
For some people it’s a very strong happening

84
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:24,220
– first day, because you are seekers. You
are seekers. Believe Me you are seekers of

85
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:34,639
thousands of years. Born in this country to
get what you have been seeking. But what do

86
00:11:34,639 --> 00:11:39,810
we expect?
I wish he had not mentioned you the word puja

87
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,379
because it can again give you the thing that
it is sort of a some one-person business.

88
00:11:45,379 --> 00:11:53,629
It’s not that. Warren says puja because
all these centers have got Deities. Especially

89
00:11:53,629 --> 00:12:05,319
this center is the center of Christ. You have
to make these Deities within you happy and

90
00:12:05,319 --> 00:12:11,629
awaken them. And that awakening must take
place; you must understand where these Deities

91
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:15,829
exist. And these deities are nothing but are
incarnations of God’s aspect like you can

92
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:24,769
say Christ incarnated, who is placed at this
point where the optic chasma is between the

93
00:12:24,769 --> 00:12:35,870
pituitary and pineal body. And when Christ
is awakened, when He gets into action within

94
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:46,170
you, then your two things that are shown there
– the blue and the yellow, the blue is the

95
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:56,050
superego and yellow is the ego, are sucked
in. Means all your karmas, all your doings,

96
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:03,449
your ego and superego are sucked in.
That means He has crucified Himself in such

97
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:13,389
a way that He has made within us a passage.
When He is awakened, He sucks that and all

98
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:18,279
our sins. Sins is nothing but conditionings
you can say and other things that we have

99
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:26,180
got within us. Everything is sucked in. When
it is sucked in, then only the Kundalini can

100
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:35,089
rise above that.
Now Sahaja Yogis know that Christ is one of

101
00:13:35,089 --> 00:13:44,920
the aspects – is the Son aspect. And there
are aspects where He is a creator, where He

102
00:13:44,920 --> 00:14:00,499
is a sustainer, where He is a Master you can
say and where He is the witness. All these

103
00:14:00,499 --> 00:14:06,079
things, people never gave chance to Him to
speak. Now I’ve been speaking for seven

104
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:14,519
years in this country. But for four years
I could’ve hardly spoken even twice or thrice

105
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:21,499
because I was struggling with six of them.
So we can imagine you gave Him only three

106
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:27,740
years or say at the most four years to speak
about these things and how many things He

107
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:34,050
has spoken and how many these people who were
supposed to be his disciples have written

108
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:42,120
down, God alone knows. And whatever they have
communicated is so limited that it has created

109
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:51,259
problems for you. But every sentence, every
word that He has spoken is so deep and you

110
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:58,870
can only understand it when you get your Realization.
When there is no light what’s the use of

111
00:14:58,870 --> 00:15:03,399
telling you there are these pictures; there
are flowers there and this picture there and

112
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:10,800
this is the color of the paper that is put
on these walls, what’s the use? There is

113
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:17,720
no light to see. When you get the light I
don’t have to tell you as He said, “The

114
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:24,809
knowledge start [tickling?] within, automatically.”
You are that Spirit and unless and until that

115
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:31,470
Spirit is manifested what else are you seeking?
A guru says, “I do this thing, I do that

116
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:39,490
thing.” All right so what? What about us?
What do we have got it from this temple? What

117
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:47,709
has he given us? You must find out. His disciples
are there. For example they went to the Ganeshpuri

118
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:51,629
this thing and there everybody was jumping.
‘Ha, ha, ha, hu, hu’, taking out clothes

119
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:56,089
and I don’t know and then taking all kinds
of drugs and this and that.

120
00:15:56,089 --> 00:16:06,100
For jumping you don’t pay. You can jump
without paying. And drugs also they had to

121
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:13,519
pay. Even without payment he could not produce
any drugs. So one should understand that this

122
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:24,470
kind of a nonsense and down foolery is mockery
of yourself. Is just mockery. You are that

123
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:31,999
dignified, magnificent thing, which is the
Spirit. And you are befooled by these people.

124
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:45,490
You should see, this much at least, that anyone
who has given any powers to another person

125
00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:50,999
should be accepted, isn’t it?
I mean supposing somebody says that a particular

126
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:56,279
thing is very good. Say – ‘this kind of
a lamp is very good.’ Then you see at least

127
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:03,350
how it works? If the one who says, “You
see the lamp”. You must at least see the

128
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:13,299
disciples of these gurus and then decide.
This is very much lacking. Like sheep they

129
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:21,779
follow and they fall into horrible ditches.
Doesn’t matter as far as God is concerned

130
00:17:21,779 --> 00:17:28,390
He’s bent upon saving His creation. He’s
bent upon it. He will do it whatever you may

131
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:33,700
try to destroy. You try your level best to
destroy yourself and destroy the world that

132
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:42,110
He has created. But He is all-powerful. He
is all forgiving. He is all compassion. He

133
00:17:42,110 --> 00:17:49,539
is going to save you whatever you may try.
Try your level best. But for a change why

134
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:56,419
not try to save yourself and save others?
This is what one has to seek.

135
00:17:56,419 --> 00:18:04,779
Now when listening to Me also you should doubt
because you are in free condition. You are

136
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:12,710
not mesmerized by Me. If I was a real mesmerizer,
you could not have asked Me any questions.

137
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,070
You all would’ve fallen straight at My feet.
There would have been no questioning at all

138
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:23,140
because there are thousands who are doing
that stupidly. But you are free, you are free

139
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:29,140
to doubt, no doubt. But doubting what? One
has to think, “What are we doubting?”

140
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:38,200
As he said, “I am the most expensive person.”
[IT MAKES ME LAUGH?] Because you cannot pay

141
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:45,490
for it. It’s so expensive that all your
banks drained out cannot pay for it. All your

142
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:50,760
wealth that you have here so called wealth
that you have accumulated cannot purchase

143
00:18:50,760 --> 00:19:00,140
it. It’s so expensive. It is invaluable.
Is the richest thing in the world that cannot

144
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:08,450
be purchased by any riches. It is, no doubt
but is not exclusive. It’s meant for everyone.

145
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:14,350
The doors are open now for everyone.
Now don’t you worry. Don’t count your

146
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:23,179
sins and your guilts and this and that, forget
that. It’s the grace that itself is anxious

147
00:19:23,179 --> 00:19:30,390
as I told you and you all ought to get your
realization and should grow into it. You will

148
00:19:30,390 --> 00:19:36,580
enjoy the complete bliss of your being which
is so beautiful. Like a diamond it is sparkling.

149
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:45,669
Only thing, you have to just unveil it. And
that is not difficult for you, not at all

150
00:19:45,669 --> 00:19:50,149
difficult.
Now the things that he has told about the

151
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:56,960
physical side, that’s the minimum that should
happen. That’s the minimum of minimum that

152
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:05,559
should happen to anyone who comes to Sahaja
Yoga. Because if you are the temple of God

153
00:20:05,559 --> 00:20:14,870
then it has to be cleansed before God is established
within you, before the Deity is sparkled in

154
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:19,299
you, it has to be cleansed. So the cleansing
takes place automatically; don’t have to

155
00:20:19,299 --> 00:20:24,679
worry about that, that’s automatic. Even
a thing like cancer can be cured in no time.

156
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:29,120
A cancer can only be cured by Sahaja Yoga,
by nothing else take it from Me. It cannot

157
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:36,019
be cured. It may be that you may loose your
throat, sometimes nose, sometimes ears and

158
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:43,350
you may continue with the doctors but with
cancer you live in one body and get cured.

159
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:49,820
And there are some cancer patients here, sitting
down. They perhaps do not know and some of

160
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:57,120
them know also; have been completely cured
by Sahajayoga. The reason is that your body

161
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,480
is just ready, is waiting for that moment
when you get the light. As soon as you get

162
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:07,539
the light immediately you know where is the
problem and you start correcting it. Once

163
00:21:07,539 --> 00:21:14,440
you start correcting it, it’s not you. But
this Power corrects it. Imagine this light

164
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:21,769
not only enlightens the room but also corrects
it. Think of such a thing that is God’s

165
00:21:21,769 --> 00:21:30,190
love. That it loves you, it coordinates everything,
it makes you cooperate and it blesses you

166
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:35,440
with the highest.
This all pervading power has been described

167
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,210
in the scriptures. Everybody said, “There
is all pervading power.” Now you might say,

168
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,610
“Where is it? We can’t see. How are we
to believe?” Now as I always give an example

169
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:52,600
of a television, which I saw first time when
it came to India. That in a village people

170
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:57,510
were told that there is an ether around us
and you can, there are lots of dramas and

171
00:21:57,510 --> 00:22:04,289
music and plays going on. They said, “How
can we believe it?” So they just put the

172
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,539
television to the mains and it started working
fantastically. And they were amazed, they

173
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:15,299
had to believe that is coming, there’s no
other connection, is coming, through this.

174
00:22:15,299 --> 00:22:23,480
That’s what it is. You are an instrument.
Exquisitely made, beautifully, delicately

175
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,899
constructed. Just for this happening. Of course
you’ve ruined it. So many have ruined it

176
00:22:29,899 --> 00:22:35,500
no doubt; you have tried in your childishness.
Doesn’t matter; makes no difference. You

177
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:41,210
will get your realization. You should have
no worry on that point. That’s My worry.

178
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,260
Once you get your realization then you can
give realizations to others.

179
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:52,460
Now about the lady that he told who got well
and was very sick. I must tell you that first

180
00:22:52,460 --> 00:23:01,120
of all she was very very sick and she was
about to die. I was not there at that time.

181
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:08,159
Actually these people were there. Warren didn’t
want to say out of humility I think.

182
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:16,190
These people went there and put My photograph
there and gave her vibrations. And she came

183
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:22,610
to consciousness and they were surprised.
The one, who was going to die, has been declared

184
00:23:22,610 --> 00:23:29,850
– going to die very soon, came to consciousness.
And they then thought there’s something

185
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:38,720
great about it. Then they came away. Still
the doctors couldn’t believe it. And the

186
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:44,159
relations also said, “How can that be? What
is it?” She again went into coma, when I

187
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:49,610
was there.
But a gentleman, who was related to her, was

188
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:56,610
connected with newspapers. Some how it worked
out and he published a lot that we have proof

189
00:23:56,610 --> 00:24:01,610
to believe that Sahaja Yoga can cure people.
And that’s how it started and that’s how

190
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:09,950
worked out. But the first thing was done by
Warren and company, not by Mother.

191
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:18,380
So they themselves had the powers to cure,
to give realization, to do all that I can

192
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:24,809
do. And that’s what it is that once you
are enlightened you should manifest your own

193
00:24:24,809 --> 00:24:31,320
powers. Otherwise the rest of the thing is
nothing but a joke. You jump or you stand

194
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,399
on your heads. That you can always do what
is so great about it? If it is some God’s

195
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:43,019
grace has to come upon you then you must manifest
something special. Not only curing but raising

196
00:24:43,019 --> 00:24:49,149
of the Kundalini.
Now this triangular bone is called as sacrum,

197
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:54,340
meaning sacred bone that means these people,
who have given the name to it long time back,

198
00:24:54,340 --> 00:25:01,120
must have known that this is a sacred bone.
Otherwise why did they call it sacrum? But

199
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,350
I think that knowledge was lost in Latin,
in Norway must have been, the knowledge was

200
00:25:07,350 --> 00:25:12,220
lost and that’s how they do not know, they
just call it the sacrum. Now you can see with

201
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:18,960
your naked eyes, the pulsation of the Kundalini
and rising. You can feel the pulsation on

202
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,210
your head when it comes there and afterwards
you find complete it has become quiet. As

203
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:30,059
soon as becomes quiet you start feeling in
the hands. Of course this center should be

204
00:25:30,059 --> 00:25:33,809
all right. If this center is not all right
you don’t feel in the hands but you feel

205
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:41,159
on the head. This center is to be corrected
then, then you can feel in your hands.

206
00:25:41,159 --> 00:25:47,679
Now this you can do yourself when you are
realized. Its not only Me, you can do it also.

207
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:55,200
I mean in, say in Australia say, we can say
if there are two thousand people who have

208
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:04,980
got Realization, I could’ve given only to
about five hundred, the rest are done by these

209
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,230
people only.
You people can give Realization. But difference

210
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:15,480
in Australia and here is – now if an English
Sahaja Yogi tries to talk to someone about

211
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:21,659
Sahaja Yoga, the person says, “You are not
supposed to discuss religion”. I mean that’s

212
00:26:21,659 --> 00:26:26,649
an etiquette, it is supposed to be. You can’t
discuss religion. This you can’t discuss

213
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:34,250
God. So they run away. Hard to get even two
people in, to talk about Sahaja Yoga. This

214
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:38,450
is the problem otherwise all of them are capable
of giving realization.

215
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:48,610
Now Douglas is sitting here. Talk to David
Frawl. I knew that he was doing TM and he

216
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:56,190
told him also. And here talking to him, David
Frawl feeling heated up, absolutely boiling.

217
00:26:56,190 --> 00:27:03,149
And he was perspiring, is a fact. And when
he came to the thing, now he’s got Realization.

218
00:27:03,149 --> 00:27:09,889
He is giving Realization to people when he
got cured. I mean you don’t need much brains

219
00:27:09,889 --> 00:27:20,080
for that. You don’t need any accessories
of the world, which are regarded as very practical.

220
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,690
I would say that Douglas at that time was
one of the most impractical person. He had

221
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:32,580
taken drugs and he had taken all these things;
there are many who were like this. Some were,

222
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:37,340
some had come from lunatic asylum and they
started giving realization.

223
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:42,440
The other day in Norridge there were three
persons sitting in front row and were all

224
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:46,220
shaking up before Me. I said, “Now from
where these have come?” I asked them, “From

225
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:51,419
where they have come.” They said, “We
have come from lunatic asylum and we are certified

226
00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:57,330
mad people.” I said, “You are certified
and you are here. How are you here? I mean

227
00:27:57,330 --> 00:28:01,710
if you are certified mad you are not supposed
to be here”. They said, “One person came

228
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:07,970
to My program and got well. So the authorities
have sent us here for getting well, so we

229
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:14,659
are here.” And I won’t be surprised that
these three may start a Sahaja Yoga center

230
00:28:14,659 --> 00:28:21,419
in Norridge, very soon. But I said, “You
better return the certificates to them”.

231
00:28:21,419 --> 00:28:28,600
It is such a great thing you can imagine certified
mad people getting Realization and starting

232
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:32,720
a Sahaja Yoga center.
There are people who were cancer patients,

233
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:39,639
who got realization and have started a Sahaja
Yoga center. So you can imagine how tremendous

234
00:28:39,639 --> 00:28:47,940
are the Powers of God and how carefully He
has made us to be that Spirit. We have no

235
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:55,919
idea; we have no esteem of ourselves. We do
not know what great thing we are and what

236
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,700
we have to achieve and what we have to enjoy.
Actually He is such a gracious Father, He’s

237
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:09,230
so generous and He’s so loving that He wants
to share His joy. He wants you to enter into

238
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:18,450
the kingdom of God. And to enjoy that bliss,
that happiness, that freedom which has been

239
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:24,720
promised to you in all the scriptures. It’s
as simple as that. It is so simple that I

240
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:30,710
don’t know how I’ve given four hundred
lectures about such a simple thing like Self

241
00:29:30,710 --> 00:29:35,120
-Realization. And they say they are all wonderful
and one is better than the other.

242
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,380
But today’s lecture must be, has been a
more of an introduction because according

243
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:46,509
to them there are many new people today. Whatever
it is I would like to allow you to ask Me

244
00:29:46,509 --> 00:29:52,899
some questions. And everybody should admit
that new people should ask questions and Sahaja

245
00:29:52,899 --> 00:29:58,049
Yogis should not feel upset about it. Because
sometimes you know questions can be very aggressive

246
00:29:58,049 --> 00:30:02,600
and they get upset. But there should be nothing
to worry about it. Its all right your Mother

247
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:07,389
knows how to handle everything. So nothing
to be upset about it because they have already

248
00:30:07,389 --> 00:30:13,889
passed [ ? ] saying that no questions will
be allowed to ask to Mother. See if I am a

249
00:30:13,889 --> 00:30:19,950
Mother, if I have patience, if I have love
then you should not worry. You should not

250
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:25,639
worry about it at all. I have to manage all
of them. Sometimes in the beginning everybody

251
00:30:25,639 --> 00:30:28,769
is like that.
Just now Warren has told you how he was because

252
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:32,990
he was made to sleep on the cement. I mean
he was not made but he slipped out you see.

253
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:39,669
And next day he was down with very great agitation,
he was going back to Australia. But I caught

254
00:30:39,669 --> 00:30:45,220
hold of his shirt, I said, “Can you wait
for sometime lets see it might work out?”

255
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:50,789
So it is like that. It’s a very sweet thing
you know and I know that children have a right

256
00:30:50,789 --> 00:30:55,580
to get angry with Mother but not too much
of it. Because after all you are here for

257
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:00,960
a purpose and that purpose must be fulfilled.
That’s why I am here.

258
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:07,700
May God bless you all.
I would like to have really some questions

259
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:12,549
because sometimes these questions also help
a lot for Me to understand what’s the problem

260
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:28,370
is. Can I have some questions please? Yes
please.

261
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:37,940
Question: [Not Audible]
Yes, Yes. What Warren has told you is a caution

262
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:45,850
but I have, I know so many people who have
got Rrealization without any return. [NOT

263
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:53,100
AUDIBLE] I know so many people [NOT AUDIBLE].
Warren has given you a thing of caution because

264
00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:00,809
he has seen some people that they drop out
because the Kundalini comes down and they

265
00:32:00,809 --> 00:32:06,690
find little frustrating. But I have all the
patience and you should have patience but

266
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:14,960
I haven’t met anybody who has been with
us, doesn’t feel it. You may not feel the

267
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,809
vibrations but there are, Realization is there.
Because when you put your hand on your head

268
00:32:20,809 --> 00:32:25,960
you definitely get the cool breeze coming
out and you give Realizations to others, that’s

269
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:30,049
the proof of it.
There’s someone who was always caught up

270
00:32:30,049 --> 00:32:33,730
on all the fingers, he feels the tingling
all the time. But he gives Realization to

271
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:36,820
so many people. He has given himself, he’s
caught up.

272
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:42,620
Its something like this, you can say even
if it’s the fifth hand car it moves, once

273
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:49,080
started. You go on repairing it, but it moves,
no doubt it moves. So nothing to be upset

274
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,179
about it.
[NOT AUDIBLE]

275
00:32:51,179 --> 00:33:09,230
When do we? Right now? Me-Me? I don’t know
how many thousand years. I was born with it.

276
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:18,710
Yes very much, very much, very much, very
much realized. I was born as a real great

277
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:33,919
great Grand Mother, I tell you. I knew everything
about [IT or HER] from My very childhood.

278
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:41,080
I was very conscious, over alert.
[NOT AUDIBLE]

279
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:49,120
Repeat! [NOT AUDIBLE]
Rare thing beware, beware yes beware, beware,

280
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:58,500
beware, yes true. Yes, it’s correct, correct
that’s true. [NOT AUDIBLE] Yes I must tell

281
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:05,840
you about that. You see the people who have
written about Kundalini. I started knowing

282
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:09,889
about them that there are people who have
written about Kundalini. And I was amazed

283
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:14,710
because they are absolutely ignorant, not
only ignorant but stupid people. I don’t

284
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:19,360
know from where did they get this knowledge
because people do not know about this, they

285
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:22,780
started printing it. Perhaps anything you
can print and isn’t it?

286
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:27,670
I’ve seen such a big book where the fellow
doesn’t know where the Kundalini is; he

287
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:33,080
says it is in the stomach. Then he says it
is in the back, he doesn’t know anything.

288
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:42,220
Now the trouble is this knowledge was a very
secret knowledge, thousands of years back

289
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:49,090
and it started descending – this knowledge
to people very slowly like on a tree there’s

290
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:54,640
only one flower or two flowers maybe.
Now in the sixth century, actually Christ

291
00:34:54,640 --> 00:35:00,900
talked about it quite a lot. And other people
like Moses and all these people have talked

292
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:06,110
about it. But the ones, who wrote, never got
anything. [THEY HAVE?] Perhaps so they wrote

293
00:35:06,110 --> 00:35:10,640
it in a very mystical way like, ‘I’ll
appear before you like tongues of flames or

294
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:20,270
the tree of fire’ and all that – indicative
of all that. But it so happened that in the

295
00:35:20,270 --> 00:35:26,600
sixth century somebody in India called as
Adi Shankaracharya – He was actually Buddha

296
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:32,710
reborn, He started talking about it. Self-realization,
of course Buddha talked about it. Then He

297
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:36,560
started telling about these, all these nadis
and everything He described.

298
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:43,680
But there is a poet in India whose name is
Markdandeya who has written about this. They

299
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:53,190
say he was living in India about say ten thousand
years back – this poet, about that time.

300
00:35:53,190 --> 00:35:59,000
So this knowledge was known to people but
was not put down on the paper, was not circulated,

301
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:04,440
was not for en masse.
Now these people who are writing about it

302
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:10,330
have no knowledge, have no authority and they
have tried these tricks. Actually this is

303
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:18,720
the holiest of holy – the sanctum sanctorum
within you. And a person who himself is authorized

304
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,260
by God can only do it. Authorized by God not
by any say theological college or all these

305
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:32,360
things. It cannot. God should authorize – like
Christ, like you can say John the Baptist,

306
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,940
like Moses, like that somebody authorized
by God can only do it.

307
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:42,510
So these people tried the tricks, which are
unauthorized, and they got results because

308
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:52,580
there’s a deity sitting in the last chakra
called as Mooladhara chakra, which is the

309
00:36:52,580 --> 00:37:04,540
root – support of the root. That chakra,
He tries to excite your sympathetic by that

310
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,760
and when the sympathetic is excited you get
all these heats and this and that and the

311
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,850
boils and all. So it is not meant for people
who have no holiness in them. You have to

312
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:18,490
be a holy person, who should be able to raise
the Kundalini, you should be cleansed otherwise

313
00:37:18,490 --> 00:37:22,770
you cannot do this work.
While there are people who are connecting

314
00:37:22,770 --> 00:37:29,360
Kundalini, imagine, with sex. I mean it’s
an absurd thing; She’s your Mother. She

315
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:35,290
is your Mother and has been your Mother all
these ages and it’s like having a dirty

316
00:37:35,290 --> 00:37:40,320
feeling for your Mother I would say that.
It’s such a filth. So God should punish

317
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:47,190
them [INAUDIBLE]. That’s how they have it
as a punishment. It’s not at all to be afraid

318
00:37:47,190 --> 00:37:52,140
of your own Mother. Will you be? I mean that’s
one thing you are not afraid of, is your own

319
00:37:52,140 --> 00:38:00,490
Mother. Should not be. I mean modern mothers
I don’t know. But that’s what it is. It

320
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:03,980
is they have no knowledge.
Now I must tell you that Sahaja Yoga must

321
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:09,400
have given realization I don’t know how
many thousands, tens of thousands of people.

322
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:15,110
Of course you may feel little heated up or
if you are possessed, you might feel little

323
00:38:15,110 --> 00:38:20,640
bit shaken up. People who have been to TM,
one of them jumped about 20 ft., when they

324
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:25,370
heard My name. All these things may happen
to few people. But I mean such extreme cases

325
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:29,570
are very rare, that’s all. But nothing goes
wrong. I mean you are ultimately cured of

326
00:38:29,570 --> 00:38:36,540
that. So you might get little effects of that.
But nothing serious. I am here to look after.

327
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,460
On the contrary it’s very blissful, very
blissful.

328
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:49,090
If one does not know about something, they
should not get into it, isn’t it?

329
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:52,480
Any other question?
[INAUDIBLE]

330
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,640
But you must get it, that’s the main point.
You see, this if you don’t get, you will

331
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,640
never be happy person. You have to get it
and it is your right. It is within you why

332
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,610
not get it? It just doesn’t cost you anything.
You have to have it. But people refuse to

333
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:12,460
have this, imagine refuse to be the Spirit.
Can you imagine?

334
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:18,290
They are satisfied. The other day I met a
lady who came and she said, “I am quite

335
00:39:18,290 --> 00:39:24,660
satisfied with the simple life I lead, Mother”.
I said, “Now what am I to do? If you are

336
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:27,960
satisfied My child, I would only say that
a day will come and you’ll come back to

337
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:34,040
Me, but I may not be here”. You see all
these things recoil upon. What question of

338
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:40,200
sinfulness? Even a sort of a casual way towards
your Spirit, if you are casually interested

339
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:45,640
in your Spirit it tells upon you, because
Spirit resides in your heart and it recedes,

340
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:50,510
you have problems. And you all get into problems
with that. When they get into problems – I

341
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:55,700
mean a lady who came to Me, she said, “I
am not interested, this that.” And she said,

342
00:39:55,700 --> 00:40:00,700
“I don’t want to do it.” But ultimately
she got cancer. When she came to Me and she

343
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:08,110
had a galloping cancer. We tried to help her,
we couldn’t help much, she died. It happens

344
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:12,840
with some people that they come at a stage
where we cannot help them at all.

345
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:19,890
So best thing is to get your own powers of
your Spirit and be all right, enjoy yourself.

346
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,920
You don’t have to pay bills of doctors.
You don’t have to worry about so many things.

347
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:31,830
And automatically the whole thing works out.
And also the petrol bill, as he said.

348
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:38,780
Krishna has said, “Yogakshema Vahamyaham”.
Means when you have the union – Yoga, when

349
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:45,100
you become united, with that Divine Power,
the well being is looked after. I mean all

350
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:51,790
the Sahaja Yogis who are here, have benefited
even monetarily, because within us lies also

351
00:40:51,790 --> 00:40:57,600
the power, which gives us money. Which gives
us well being. There is a center within us,

352
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,510
which does that. And if that center is caught
up then people have problems with money. Once

353
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:16,370
it is cured, you don’t have. Not money as
such but material life, improves definitely.

354
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:26,380
[INAUDIBLE]
Chakras are the essences, you see, which create

355
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:33,900
our plexuses. And the plexuses are expressing
the nerves. So the chakras in any case are

356
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,440
the predecessors of the nerves, of the nervous
system. They are the predecessor. They are

357
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:51,770
the ones who supply the energy to the nerves.
They are the ones who guide the nerves – Chakras.

358
00:41:51,770 --> 00:42:00,960
[INAUDIBLE]
Astral body – our body is made of various,

359
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:09,550
various cocoons we can say. These chakras
are say we are material being or physical

360
00:42:09,550 --> 00:42:20,030
being, we are emotional being, we are mental
being, we are spiritual being and all these

361
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:30,740
are like our body. Now the astral being that
you know is actually the soul, we can say,

362
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:43,150
which is this whole body without the element
of Earth and Water, that’s the astral body.

363
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:49,520
Now this astral body you should not worry
much because that we get in any case when

364
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:56,270
we die. That you are going to get it. But
when we have the body then only we can get

365
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:00,130
our realization, not in the astral sense.
But people are trying lots of tricks with

366
00:43:00,130 --> 00:43:05,950
these astral bodies, which is a very very
dangerous thing, and it has reached such dangerous

367
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:12,850
limits, because people have interest in this,
that I am really shocked the way it is working

368
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:18,730
out.
For example: there was a couple in Switzerland

369
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:28,040
and they had a relation – their mother in
America. And that lady was trying with one

370
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:35,310
of these astral body persons, those who work
on Spirits and she said that I would like

371
00:43:35,310 --> 00:43:43,450
to talk to my grandson. And the grandson is
a living child and the child is in Switzerland.

372
00:43:43,450 --> 00:43:49,690
It sounds very fantastic to people. That is
something great you see, the child is in there

373
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:55,700
without paying any airfare you can talk to
your child – grand child. It’s very dangerous.

374
00:43:55,700 --> 00:44:00,780
And they used to try that on the child and
the child when it would sleep in the night,

375
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:08,090
it would be daytime in America. And she would
talk to him through this and she would hear

376
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:12,930
the voice of the child. They recorded all
that. One day this child was sleeping and

377
00:44:12,930 --> 00:44:20,140
he never got up, he died. And the recording
said that it is too much strain for me, now

378
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:26,350
let me go grandma, let me go, let me go. She
said, “No, no, wait for a while, wait for

379
00:44:26,350 --> 00:44:31,020
a while” and this spirit controlling woman
would not allow the Spirit to go back and

380
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:38,710
the child died, is a very common happening
now that the children suddenly die in their

381
00:44:38,710 --> 00:44:43,130
beds.
So all these tricks we should not try. Whatever

382
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:48,980
is unknown is not Divine. You have the left
side and the right side. This is called as

383
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:53,910
the Adibhautik and it’s the Adidaivik, means
the collective subconscious and collective

384
00:44:53,910 --> 00:45:00,320
supraconscious. There are all these dead Spirits.
Don’t play with them. Don’t get into this

385
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:06,470
nonsense of astral body and this and that.
There are some people who say that we want

386
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:13,230
to separate from our body and fly in the air.
Why, why do you want to do that? You want

387
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:17,890
to have your spirit or not? If you want to
have these experiences, I am not for that.

388
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:24,430
And I will ban it, if you ask Me. It’s absolutely
horrible. Of course people take money for

389
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:29,260
it and people like it to talk to spirits and
this and that but is very dangerous. You should

390
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:36,010
never try this with the spirits. Is a very
dangerous line when you do not know about

391
00:45:36,010 --> 00:45:41,710
it, one should not get to it.
I have known people who have practiced these

392
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:48,200
things; their great grand children are suffering,
seven generations they suffer – seven generations.

393
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,080
Those even practice it. So it’s a very dangerous
game, one should never play it. What is the

394
00:45:53,080 --> 00:46:02,190
need? You should live in the present not in
the future or not in the past. It’s the

395
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:07,870
present you have to achieve. So you just don’t
worry about these things. You become your

396
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:14,060
Spirit. You have to be born again and that
should happen to you, which should be an actualization

397
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:22,210
that should actually happen.
And what these Gurus are doing, are nothing

398
00:46:22,210 --> 00:46:28,550
but putting the Spirits in you and are mesmerizing.
That’s how you behave like this. You are

399
00:46:28,550 --> 00:46:37,820
no more yourself, you are something else.
This is the trick of the trade. They are all

400
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:46,640
using you for their own purposes by just mesmerizing
and mesmerism is manifested by using the Spirits,

401
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:52,830
which they are controlling. Especially for
Christians it is forbidden. I don’t know;

402
00:46:52,830 --> 00:47:03,030
I don’t know how they don’t understand.
So lets have the experience now. It’s just

403
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:10,780
a split of a second needed for that, split
of a second. It depends on, if he, if the

404
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:17,110
landings are very good you won’t feel anything
else but the cool breeze suddenly but if it

405
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:24,970
is not smooth landing take little time. As
soon as the Kundalini pierces this, you feel

406
00:47:24,970 --> 00:47:31,900
thoughtless. There is no thought. So you may
try to see just now put your hands towards

407
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,820
Me like this just because the centers are
here expressed of the sympathetic. Just put

408
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:46,550
your attention to Me and see if your thoughts
have stopped. And then close your eyes. If

409
00:47:46,550 --> 00:47:56,420
that has happened that means Kundalini has
already gone above. It moves very fast, very

410
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:03,170
fast it moves.
Now few things you have to accept in Sahaja

411
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:10,780
Yoga. First of all you have to accept that
God is the ocean of forgiveness. That He’s

412
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:20,420
ocean of love, He is compassion and you are
not guilty in His eyes at all. And you should

413
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:29,610
not feel guilty before the ocean. So you have
to just say before starting your meditation

414
00:48:29,610 --> 00:48:34,440
that ‘Mother’, in your heart, ‘I am
not guilty’, ‘Mother, I am not guilty’,

415
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:37,280
‘Mother, I am not guilty’. Thrice you
have to say.

416
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:46,940
Now you have to forgive. You must forgive
everyone. Just say that, ‘I forgive’.

417
00:48:46,940 --> 00:48:51,250
Those who say, “It is very difficult to
forgive”, actually, not to forgive, what

418
00:48:51,250 --> 00:49:02,210
to forgive is all mental activity. What do
you do by that, just torture yourself? So

419
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:10,040
please say that ‘I forgive’ and close
your eyes now. Say, ‘I forgive, Mother I

420
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:17,210
forgive everyone’. Just say, ‘Mother I
forgive everyone’. Keep your feet on the

421
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:25,710
ground both the sides touching and don’t
move much. Just say ‘Mother I forgive everyone’

422
00:49:25,710 --> 00:49:37,710
say it thrice. Now put your right hand on
your heart where the Spirit resides. And without

423
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:43,620
feeling guilty, without feeling guilty, again
I say, without feeling guilty say that ‘if

424
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:50,410
we have done any mistakes, please forgive
us, please forgive me’. Say this thrice

425
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:59,640
from your heart – ‘if in my seeking, if
I have done mistake, if I have neglected my

426
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:09,430
Spirit or if I have neglected my duties towards
my Spirit, please forgive me’. Just go on

427
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:14,910
saying ‘please forgive me’. But don’t
feel guilty with it. You are not to feel guilty

428
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:22,210
about it. Just say it that ‘please forgive
me’.

429
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:26,100
I think you should again say, ‘I am not
guilty’ because as soon as you say that,

430
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:34,160
there’s a catch on the left Vishuddhi, so
you say ‘please forgive me and also forgive

431
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:47,310
me for being guilty’. That would be better.
Now you ask a question ‘Mother am I the

432
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:54,320
Spirit?’ Ask the question ‘Mother am I
the Spirit?’ Ask thrice – ‘Mother am

433
00:50:54,320 --> 00:51:06,280
I the Spirit?’ You might feel cool breeze
coming in. You ask thrice. If not, now say

434
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:18,540
‘Mother please give me my realization’.
Say it thrice. Just say it thrice. Then it

435
00:51:18,540 --> 00:51:24,100
would work out. You will start feeling the
cool breeze in the hand – left hand. Stretch

436
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:35,110
it towards Me, little bit. Stretch it. Ask
for realization. Now don’t feel guilty.

437
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:46,970
Are you are getting it now? Don’t feel guilty;
you are not to feel guilty. That’s the biggest

438
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:52,760
disease of the West.
Now you put your right hand on the head and

439
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:59,220
you might feel the cool breeze coming out
from your head. Just see if there’s a cool

440
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:13,850
breeze coming in. Raise it higher, see may
be? Is it? Not feeling. In the hand? Not yet.

441
00:52:13,850 --> 00:52:22,740
Close your eyes and ask the question – ‘Mother
am I the Spirit?’ Thrice – ‘Mother am

442
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:36,050
I the Spirit? Mother am I the Spirit?’ Now
ask for realization – ‘Mother please give

443
00:52:36,050 --> 00:52:46,250
me my realization’, thrice. Now you can
put your left hand on your head and right

444
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:51,330
hand towards Me. Let’s say some people have
this problem you see. Right hand towards Me.

445
00:52:51,330 --> 00:53:07,060
Now, ask the question ‘Mother am I the Spirit?’
Ok thrice. Now you forgive, you just forgive,

446
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:15,550
forgive, forgive everyone. Say, ‘I forgive,
I forgive’ once again, ‘I forgive, I forgive,

447
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:16,740
I forgive’. Again, ‘I forgive’. All
right, getting it? Not yet? All right, if

448
00:53:16,740 --> 00:53:21,210
you won’t, now, not yet? We’ll see.
Are you? Little bit on the hands, just see,

449
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:33,230
may be in the hand just see. It will work
out, it will work out. It takes little time

450
00:53:33,230 --> 00:53:36,200
but it works out, works out, it works out.
Don’t you worry; don’t get desperate with

451
00:53:36,200 --> 00:53:37,630
yourself. Keep your eyes shut. It will start
coming slowly, slowly, slowly; it will start

452
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:37,890
working. It is very subtle but it starts working.
Now. I think open those windows to pass out

453
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:38,850
some of these heats. Lot of heat is coming
out.

454
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:42,540
Now just see. Douglas, Douglas, see your neighbor,
has he got it on his head? Just see, here

455
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,570
him, just see him, not yet! He has got it,
he has got. That’s what I feel. Can you

456
00:53:46,570 --> 00:53:54,230
see all of you? You have got it. I knew, you
got it long time back. Now see, what about

457
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:55,100
you? Just ask for forgiveness, a little bit,
all right, ask for forgiveness. Kathy, can

458
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,350
you see? Can you see the gentleman next to
you? John! We’ll work it out, somebody will

459
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,760
work it out. Don’t you be worried about
what they are doing because the Power is flowing

460
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:18,330
from them so they are just working it out.
Who are all the new people, please raise your

461
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:19,280
hands so they’ll come and help you. Just
go, come along. Ken, come along. Left Swadishtan

462
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:21,310
– you have to say the mantra of Nirmala
Vidya to get over the left Swadishtana, is

463
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:35,380
quite a lot.
[Mother speaks in Marathi].

464
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:41,810
It’s all right I think, a little liver,
a little. How is the lady? She has left, left

465
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:48,290
Nabhi. Ask her to put her right hand on the
left Nabhi. She’ll be all right.

466
00:54:48,290 --> 00:54:52,070
[NOT AUDIBLE]
Felicity, are you all right, better? Please

467
00:54:52,070 --> 00:54:57,510
do not feel guilty. If it has taken time,
don’t you feel guilty. What’s the matter?

468
00:54:57,510 --> 00:55:01,770
Jamail, right heart. Please don’t feel guilty,
what are you guilty about, don’t feel guilty,

469
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:04,890
all right. There is nothing to feel guilty,
what is there to feel guilty? I mean what

470
00:55:04,890 --> 00:55:08,150
crime have you committed? She has got it actually,
enjoying. Now, how is this gentleman, right

471
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:11,540
Vishuddhi? Left? You are feeling guilty, Mr.
all right. Yes, now put your left hand like

472
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:17,740
this towards Me. And now put your right hand
here and now say that you are not guilty at

473
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:23,980
all. ‘I am not guilty’, just say it to
yourself, say it thrice, again.
