00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:39.937
﻿I bow

00:00:40.137 --> 00:00:42.859
to all the seekers of Truth

00:00:44.043 --> 00:00:45.543
and the Truth

00:00:46.645 --> 00:00:48.665
that we are seeking

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.246
has to be achieved,

00:00:54.543 --> 00:00:56.511
understood and felt

00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:00.577
through a very open mind.

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:05.588
You cannot conceive the Truth

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:07.885
with your mental activity,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.100
and you cannot form your own ideas and conventions

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.700
about it.

00:01:17.843 --> 00:01:19.603
Like a scientist,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.233
you have to keep your mind open

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:24.434
to achieve it.

00:01:25.147 --> 00:01:26.694
Moreover

00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:30.253
it is an evolutionary process,

00:01:30.453 --> 00:01:31.753
the process

00:01:31.953 --> 00:01:34.635
by which you have become a human being.

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:38.460
And logically, it should follow,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.940
that you cannot put in any effort

00:01:45.743 --> 00:01:49.119
to become the higher personality.

00:01:51.129 --> 00:01:53.511
You have put in no effort

00:01:53.863 --> 00:01:56.222
for your evolution so far.

00:01:57.104 --> 00:01:58.604
Thirdly,

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.387
you have paid no money

00:02:00.587 --> 00:02:02.628
to become a human being.

00:02:02.942 --> 00:02:05.075
God doesn’t understand money.

00:02:05.342 --> 00:02:07.775
This is created by human beings.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.330
God has no sense of money

00:02:10.925 --> 00:02:13.701
and He doesn’t know also, perhaps, how maddening it is

00:02:13.902 --> 00:02:15.269
for human beings.

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.414
So you cannot pay for it.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.574
It’s something ridiculous

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:24.575
to think that you can pay for your ascent,

00:02:24.947 --> 00:02:27.993
or to say that you can go into a course

00:02:28.193 --> 00:02:29.828
of realization,

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:33.544
because it is a living process

00:02:34.041 --> 00:02:37.008
of your evolution – a living process.

00:02:37.635 --> 00:02:40.135
If we understand the living process,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.530
you will understand Sahaja Yoga much better.

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:48.588
If you have to sprout a seed,

00:02:49.962 --> 00:02:52.195
you just put it in the Mother Earth

00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:54.074
and She sprouts it.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.127
How much money do you give Her?

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:00.288
She doesn’t understand money.

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.495
She only knows

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:05.271
how to sprout the seed.

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.382
So when you

00:03:07.843 --> 00:03:09.740
put the seed in the Mother Earth,

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.649
it sprouts spontaneously, sahaja.

00:03:13.972 --> 00:03:15.856
Saha means with,

00:03:16.056 --> 00:03:17.556
ja means born.

00:03:17.817 --> 00:03:21.308
It is born within you the capacity to sprout;

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.380
the capacity to awaken your Kundalini is born with you.

00:03:26.125 --> 00:03:28.212
But it has to be

00:03:28.412 --> 00:03:31.009
the Mother Earth who has to do the job.

00:03:31.398 --> 00:03:33.538
Like every seed has

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:35.531
all the maps

00:03:36.054 --> 00:03:39.140
of its past and all its future.

00:03:39.523 --> 00:03:42.273
You have those maps within yourself

00:03:42.843 --> 00:03:45.757
and once you just

00:03:48.607 --> 00:03:50.107
become

00:03:51.438 --> 00:03:54.462
capable of getting enlightened,

00:03:54.662 --> 00:03:56.743
you get your enlightenment.

00:03:56.943 --> 00:04:00.305
But we should not put any diffidence into your mind.

00:04:00.563 --> 00:04:02.034
Many people start thinking

00:04:02.234 --> 00:04:03.876
that you have to do the cleansing first,

00:04:04.076 --> 00:04:06.235
and then you get realization.

00:04:07.418 --> 00:04:09.148
When you are

00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:13.040
inside the dirt, how can you cleanse?

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:18.736
So this Sahaja Yoga today is of this way

00:04:19.735 --> 00:04:22.068
that first you get out of it,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.060
first have a little light in your lamp,

00:04:25.742 --> 00:04:28.253
The light is there and the lamp, if it is dirty,

00:04:28.453 --> 00:04:31.651
it is easier to clean the lamp which is enlightened

00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:34.923
than to clean a lamp which has no enlightenment.

00:04:37.023 --> 00:04:38.492
That’s why first

00:04:38.692 --> 00:04:40.723
you get your Self realization.

00:04:42.553 --> 00:04:45.132
That is very important before

00:04:45.332 --> 00:04:47.072
we deal with anything else,

00:04:47.272 --> 00:04:50.516
that you must get your Self realization first.

00:04:50.965 --> 00:04:53.420
This is what Christ has said that

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:56.728
you are to be born again.

00:04:57.148 --> 00:05:00.646
He didn’t mean some sort of an artificial baptism. He never meant that.

00:05:00.846 --> 00:05:02.078
How could He mean that?

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.705
Logically, you must understand, that if He was Truth

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.788
he would not tell that you can have a false

00:05:09.569 --> 00:05:10.849
baptism.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.600
But what He has said is that by this Spirit,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.733
your Spirit will be awakened.

00:05:16.222 --> 00:05:17.828
It means a person

00:05:18.152 --> 00:05:20.518
who has got his Spirit enlightened

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:22.538
can enlighten

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:24.852
a light,

00:05:25.052 --> 00:05:27.652
Or a candle which is already enlightened

00:05:27.852 --> 00:05:29.912
can enlighten another light.

00:05:30.334 --> 00:05:32.048
But what has it done? Nothing.

00:05:32.248 --> 00:05:34.876
It had the light, the other one was ready,

00:05:35.076 --> 00:05:37.579
so the light passes from one light to another.

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:39.292
There is no obligation,

00:05:39.492 --> 00:05:43.319
there is no greatness about it, there’s nothing special done.

00:05:43.695 --> 00:05:46.933
So as far as you are concerned, you are all ready

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:49.596
today to have your realization.

00:05:50.432 --> 00:05:54.020
Many people I have met so far, in the West ‘specially,

00:05:54.336 --> 00:05:56.841
want to escape the Truth

00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:59.180
because they say that Mother,

00:05:59.381 --> 00:06:01.219
we have to cleanse ourselves.

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.100
You go ahead with it.

00:06:03.339 --> 00:06:05.456
How many years you have been doing that,

00:06:05.656 --> 00:06:07.601
how many lives, how many ages?

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:10.202
Now stop it. It’s finished now.

00:06:10.402 --> 00:06:14.279
Better have your enlightenment and then see how you can

00:06:15.359 --> 00:06:18.957
very nicely clean yourself and see what’s wrong with you.

00:06:19.157 --> 00:06:20.332
Moreover,

00:06:20.532 --> 00:06:23.600
it is very difficult to tell anyone,

00:06:23.814 --> 00:06:25.139
even if you see

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.913
the dirt in a person, that this is dirty.

00:06:28.134 --> 00:06:31.528
It is better that, Supposing
there’s something wrong with this shawl.

00:06:31.728 --> 00:06:34.740
I’d better take it out, see for myself what’s wrong with it

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:36.353
and I can cleanse it.

00:06:36.553 --> 00:06:39.625
In the same way you have to get out of yourself,

00:06:40.246 --> 00:06:42.979
to see for yourself what’s wrong with you

00:06:43.607 --> 00:06:46.141
and that is how it will be much easier

00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.239
for you to clean if you know how to clean yourself.

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:51.989
So you become the person

00:06:52.189 --> 00:06:53.692
who is the Spirit.

00:06:53.892 --> 00:06:55.884
The Spirit sees

00:06:56.204 --> 00:06:59.391
the defects in you and the Spirit guides you

00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:01.465
and cleanses you completely.

00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:03.340
There is no more guide needed

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:06.966
or no gurus needed. You become your own guru.

00:07:13.044 --> 00:07:16.762
So many kinds of people have come

00:07:18.153 --> 00:07:20.419
to sell their goods in the market.

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:23.310
You cannot sell God

00:07:23.646 --> 00:07:27.038
and the one who lives on your earnings is a parasite.

00:07:27.646 --> 00:07:30.754
He cannot be a holy person or a saintly person.

00:07:31.709 --> 00:07:34.821
Christ did not take any money from people did He?

00:07:35.021 --> 00:07:37.155
He was born as a carpenter’s son

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:39.763
and He worked as a carpenter’s son.

00:07:40.165 --> 00:07:42.220
But what is the purpose

00:07:43.648 --> 00:07:45.218
of His advent?

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:48.960
What is the purpose of my coming to Boston is this:

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:51.348
that we all deserve

00:07:51.645 --> 00:07:53.566
this higher state.

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:57.191
It is all your own. It is your right.

00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.379
I should say I’m like a banker

00:07:59.579 --> 00:08:01.558
and I have to cash your checks.

00:08:05.868 --> 00:08:08.528
The purpose of this happening is

00:08:08.728 --> 00:08:10.484
complete transformation.

00:08:11.016 --> 00:08:13.308
The transformation has to take place.

00:08:13.785 --> 00:08:15.284
What is the problem

00:08:15.484 --> 00:08:18.973
of the world today is a moral crisis.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.852
People are morally,

00:08:22.052 --> 00:08:25.168
absolutely fagged out, tired.

00:08:25.793 --> 00:08:28.028
They have lost all their discretion.

00:08:28.543 --> 00:08:31.217
They don’t know what to do; they are so confused

00:08:31.417 --> 00:08:33.961
whether this is true or that is true

00:08:34.161 --> 00:08:38.019
because we live in relative world. Everything is relative.

00:08:38.219 --> 00:08:41.212
This will do, that will do. Everybody’s compromising.

00:08:41.412 --> 00:08:43.321
They don’t know what is absolute

00:08:43.521 --> 00:08:47.521
because we have not achieved our absolute within ourselves.

00:08:47.856 --> 00:08:49.720
Now the most remarkable thing

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.610
about the absolute, that is the Spirit is

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.095
that the absolute

00:08:54.295 --> 00:08:57.118
is the one that is collectively conscious.

00:08:58.537 --> 00:09:01.216
That’s the one that can feel

00:09:01.416 --> 00:09:03.018
another person.

00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:06.196
That’s the one which knows

00:09:06.396 --> 00:09:08.388
about everybody else.

00:09:08.599 --> 00:09:12.299
That’s the one which knows also about yourself.

00:09:12.802 --> 00:09:14.649
So far as a human being,

00:09:14.849 --> 00:09:18.121
the Spirit has not come into your consciousness.

00:09:21.349 --> 00:09:24.028
It’s not yet enlightened, means

00:09:24.294 --> 00:09:27.720
your consciousness hasn’t got the light of your Spirit.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.120
The Spirit is in your Heart

00:09:31.998 --> 00:09:35.727
and this Spirit is just watching you as a witness.

00:09:35.927 --> 00:09:37.442
It has not entered

00:09:37.642 --> 00:09:40.671
into your consciousness, into your attention,

00:09:40.871 --> 00:09:42.195
and because of that,

00:09:42.396 --> 00:09:44.583
you do not know what is absolute,

00:09:44.783 --> 00:09:46.883
what is collective consciousness.

00:09:47.509 --> 00:09:50.661
When it happens to you, it happens in your awareness.

00:09:50.861 --> 00:09:53.852
It doesn’t happen in your mental conceptions like,

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:57.775
I can give you a big book to read
and then you become something great?

00:09:58.017 --> 00:10:00.132
Your own consciousness,

00:10:00.332 --> 00:10:01.937
which is a human consciousness,

00:10:02.145 --> 00:10:04.638
becomes a higher consciousness,

00:10:04.876 --> 00:10:08.876
which becomes collectively
conscious, means it is an actualization.

00:10:09.814 --> 00:10:12.957
Like a person who is a human being

00:10:13.157 --> 00:10:15.985
can feel the dirt and filth,

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.543
the colors, the beauty,

00:10:18.743 --> 00:10:20.947
but an animal cannot.

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.576
So something is happening in our consciousness, actually,

00:10:25.776 --> 00:10:28.276
that we can feel the filth.

00:10:30.023 --> 00:10:33.780
In the same way, when you become absolute,

00:10:34.461 --> 00:10:37.212
everything that is not absolute

00:10:37.412 --> 00:10:38.890
starts negating itself.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:40.590
It just disappears,

00:10:40.951 --> 00:10:44.552
and you become absolute yourself, which is the Truth.

00:10:45.013 --> 00:10:47.385
You become absolute joy

00:10:47.902 --> 00:10:51.096
and you become absolute consciousness.

00:10:51.530 --> 00:10:55.096
So far, the consciousness has moved to the human stage

00:10:56.943 --> 00:10:59.310
in such a way that we have not felt

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:01.510
that we have moved higher

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.908
because we were not made like that.

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:09.060
At the human stage only we are made in a special way. If you see,

00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:11.936
here as you can see it clearly,

00:11:12.136 --> 00:11:14.516
that from the left side

00:11:15.175 --> 00:11:18.708
there’s a blue balloon-like stuff rising.

00:11:20.011 --> 00:11:22.096
This blue thing is nothing

00:11:22.296 --> 00:11:24.600
but all of our conditioning’s

00:11:24.800 --> 00:11:26.772
which becomes what we call

00:11:26.972 --> 00:11:28.612
in Sanskrit as manasa,

00:11:28.812 --> 00:11:31.912
but very closely we can call it as super ego

00:11:32.335 --> 00:11:35.855
where we are conditioned: Don’t do this, don’t do that.

00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:40.293
We are born, say, as Americans.

00:11:40.642 --> 00:11:43.451
I mean it’s not true. You are a human being.

00:11:43.651 --> 00:11:46.986
God never created America.
It is we who have created America,

00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:48.376
England, these things.

00:11:48.576 --> 00:11:50.987
He just created
one beautiful world.

00:11:51.187 --> 00:11:52.921
So then you are Americans.

00:11:53.241 --> 00:11:55.052
Identification starts like that.

00:11:55.252 --> 00:11:57.991
Then you go ahead and you think we are

00:11:58.191 --> 00:12:00.322
Christians or Hindus or Muslims.

00:12:00.522 --> 00:12:01.831
Then you go ahead with that

00:12:02.031 --> 00:12:05.132
and all these misidentifications start accumulating within us

00:12:05.332 --> 00:12:08.369
and all of them form an artificial thing

00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:10.857
called as superego in your head.

00:12:11.809 --> 00:12:13.134
All the conditioning,

00:12:13.334 --> 00:12:15.551
all the possessions, all the opposition’s,

00:12:15.751 --> 00:12:18.834
all sorts of things that you gathered

00:12:19.034 --> 00:12:21.127
in many lives can be there

00:12:21.327 --> 00:12:23.059
called as superego.

00:12:24.456 --> 00:12:27.885
On the other side we have got the ego,

00:12:28.877 --> 00:12:32.441
the one that we

00:12:32.641 --> 00:12:35.649
accumulate within ourselves or create within ourselves

00:12:35.849 --> 00:12:37.758
by our activity

00:12:38.375 --> 00:12:40.887
because we think we have done this,

00:12:41.376 --> 00:12:42.601
is the ego.

00:12:42.801 --> 00:12:46.067
Actually human beings cannot do anything.

00:12:46.981 --> 00:12:50.781
What they do is to explore whatever is dead.

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.390
They cannot do living work.

00:12:53.691 --> 00:12:55.738
They cannot transfer one flower into fruit,

00:12:55.938 --> 00:12:57.777
even one flower into fruit.

00:12:58.204 --> 00:13:00.707
All this living work is done by someone.

00:13:00.907 --> 00:13:03.441
We do not think how we are created,

00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:05.768
how this beautiful human being is created.

00:13:05.968 --> 00:13:07.569
We haven’t got humility

00:13:07.769 --> 00:13:11.280
to understand that this
something great has happened to us,

00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:14.151
that there is some sort of a force,

00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:16.225
some living force,

00:13:17.507 --> 00:13:19.667
some very kindly,

00:13:20.491 --> 00:13:23.125
loving force that has done this.

00:13:23.609 --> 00:13:25.968
We never even felt how we were created like that.

00:13:26.168 --> 00:13:29.668
Without any pains we are created as human beings.

00:13:29.968 --> 00:13:31.952
This great living work

00:13:32.152 --> 00:13:33.867
that is happening within us,

00:13:34.067 --> 00:13:35.843
who has done this living work?

00:13:36.043 --> 00:13:37.482
How has it come?

00:13:37.682 --> 00:13:40.960
We have never felt that all-pervading

00:13:41.253 --> 00:13:42.838
Power of God

00:13:43.038 --> 00:13:45.000
that is doing all these things.

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.760
Not only that but

00:13:48.376 --> 00:13:49.701
it sorts out things;

00:13:49.901 --> 00:13:52.694
it’s such a beautiful mechanism.

00:13:52.951 --> 00:13:56.280
Like a mango tree

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.827
will give you mangoes.

00:13:58.027 --> 00:14:00.604
If it’s an ananas tree it will give you ananas.

00:14:00.804 --> 00:14:04.599
Like that you have all kinds of different

00:14:04.804 --> 00:14:08.804
sorting out to such an extent
that your child will look like you.

00:14:09.733 --> 00:14:11.733
Who does all this sorting out?

00:14:12.124 --> 00:14:14.948
All this Power that does

00:14:15.417 --> 00:14:17.142
all the living work.

00:14:17.342 --> 00:14:20.112
The scientists also have not done their [unclear].

00:14:20.312 --> 00:14:24.229
They’re honest but they’re not so educated,

00:14:25.433 --> 00:14:27.956
they’re not so well informed

00:14:28.206 --> 00:14:30.500
and their seeking is very limited

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.534
because their brains are limited,

00:14:32.734 --> 00:14:35.654
their mental capacity is limited.

00:14:36.117 --> 00:14:37.957
If they have to go further,

00:14:38.157 --> 00:14:41.645
they have to become higher personalities to be able to see

00:14:41.845 --> 00:14:43.452
how we are created,

00:14:43.652 --> 00:14:47.152
how do we exist and how this living force acts.

00:14:50.106 --> 00:14:52.484
Now, for us,

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:55.098
as we take everything for granted.

00:14:56.161 --> 00:14:57.980
We do not even think about it

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:01.258
is a good thing. Otherwise, we might go mad

00:15:01.458 --> 00:15:04.660
thinking that we do not know about the Power

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:06.816
that does the living work.

00:15:07.337 --> 00:15:11.337
So we have an idea that we do this work and that work.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.572
What do we do? Supposing a tree is dead

00:15:13.772 --> 00:15:15.412
we make this floor,

00:15:15.612 --> 00:15:18.586
church, this, that – all stones.

00:15:19.103 --> 00:15:21.095
It’s dead from the dead.

00:15:21.295 --> 00:15:24.423
We have just changed the forms from dead to the dead.

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:26.823
What special thing have you done?

00:15:27.123 --> 00:15:30.630
When we start thinking that we have done something,

00:15:30.896 --> 00:15:33.404
that is how we develop an ego.

00:15:34.412 --> 00:15:36.956
Like people going in an airplane were told

00:15:37.156 --> 00:15:39.502
not to take too much luggage in a village.

00:15:39.702 --> 00:15:43.011
They talked it’s better to reduce the weight

00:15:43.327 --> 00:15:44.652
of the plane,

00:15:44.852 --> 00:15:47.412
so they put the weight on their heads,

00:15:47.612 --> 00:15:48.891
sitting in the plane.

00:15:49.091 --> 00:15:52.299
In the same way we are putting the weight on our heads,

00:15:52.499 --> 00:15:55.416
thinking that we have to do this job, that job.

00:15:55.616 --> 00:15:58.663
The one who has created you,
the one who has made you a human being,

00:15:58.863 --> 00:16:00.858
is going to make you higher.

00:16:01.515 --> 00:16:03.366
Why do you take the load upon yourself?

00:16:03.566 --> 00:16:05.620
That’s why Mr. Ego sits on your head

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:09.472
like a heavy weight, “I have to do this. I have to do that,”

00:16:09.672 --> 00:16:12.648
without understanding the plan of the Divine.

00:16:14.058 --> 00:16:17.684
That’s all we have, ego and superego sitting on our head,

00:16:17.884 --> 00:16:19.446
and we start feeling

00:16:19.646 --> 00:16:21.948
that we are something great.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:24.500
Now this happening has taken place within us

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.481
because we are human beings.

00:16:27.294 --> 00:16:30.019
A dog doesn’t have responsibilities as such.

00:16:30.219 --> 00:16:33.204
Whatever he does he does through his responses

00:16:33.404 --> 00:16:34.613
through its superego.

00:16:34.813 --> 00:16:36.824
But human being has developed the ego

00:16:37.024 --> 00:16:39.790
and because of that his brain is closed now.

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:42.109
He is like an egg.

00:16:42.946 --> 00:16:44.406
Now this egg

00:16:44.606 --> 00:16:47.988
has been ‘specially
made to become the bird

00:16:48.816 --> 00:16:51.285
and that transformation has to take place

00:16:51.485 --> 00:16:52.980
which is all built in within you.

00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:55.160
You have all these powers within you.

00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:57.575
It has just to be clicked

00:16:57.775 --> 00:16:59.100
and the warmth

00:16:59.300 --> 00:17:00.578
of the love

00:17:00.778 --> 00:17:03.046
of the Divine has to work it out

00:17:03.246 --> 00:17:05.382
so that you become the bird

00:17:05.582 --> 00:17:08.086
of complete, absolute freedom.

00:17:08.936 --> 00:17:10.469
This is what

00:17:11.488 --> 00:17:13.968
Christ wanted to inform us

00:17:14.168 --> 00:17:15.688
by His resurrection

00:17:16.398 --> 00:17:19.041
and when we have

00:17:19.241 --> 00:17:21.988
Easter you know that we have eggs.

00:17:22.188 --> 00:17:23.932
The egg is suggesting

00:17:24.132 --> 00:17:26.105
that you are the egg today

00:17:26.305 --> 00:17:29.886
but on an Easter Christ, as He became the bird,

00:17:30.086 --> 00:17:33.597
you also become the birds.

00:17:33.797 --> 00:17:36.879
And so we should say the time has come for all of you

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:38.358
to become the birds.

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.621
But it is impossible for human beings

00:17:40.821 --> 00:17:44.243
because they’re such made,
I don’t know how, especially in the West,

00:17:44.443 --> 00:17:46.958
to understand that there could be somebody who is

00:17:47.158 --> 00:17:50.419
genuinely interested in the well-being of others.

00:17:51.045 --> 00:17:53.505
They cannot understand because of their

00:17:53.705 --> 00:17:55.564
relative ideas.

00:17:55.764 --> 00:17:58.763
They cannot understand that there should be someone

00:17:58.963 --> 00:18:00.567
who should do this job;

00:18:00.767 --> 00:18:03.092
who should communicate

00:18:03.292 --> 00:18:05.239
with people who are seekers,

00:18:05.439 --> 00:18:07.281
to give them their Truth

00:18:07.481 --> 00:18:09.732
and to give them their transformation,

00:18:09.932 --> 00:18:12.052
to put them up on
their consciousness

00:18:12.252 --> 00:18:14.293
as realized souls.

00:18:15.099 --> 00:18:18.156
Now, actually, in the movement of consciousness,

00:18:18.356 --> 00:18:20.895
when human beings were born, what they started

00:18:21.095 --> 00:18:24.152
sorting out everything on mental level,

00:18:24.352 --> 00:18:25.727
everything on mental level.

00:18:25.927 --> 00:18:27.812
And whatever works on a mental level

00:18:28.012 --> 00:18:30.578
works out in a linear manner.

00:18:30.778 --> 00:18:33.887
Like there is no sustenance in that.

00:18:34.169 --> 00:18:36.812
If something starts moving in a linear way it falls off,

00:18:37.012 --> 00:18:38.321
again recoils back.

00:18:38.521 --> 00:18:40.251
That’s why today we are shocked.

00:18:40.451 --> 00:18:41.932
We have evolved so much,

00:18:42.132 --> 00:18:45.260
we have developed so much,
we are supposed to be developed people,

00:18:45.460 --> 00:18:48.803
and then how is it we are on the brink of a shock?

00:18:49.273 --> 00:18:52.720
Why are you so upset? What has gone wrong with us?

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:54.196
Where did we go wrong?

00:18:54.396 --> 00:18:58.293
Because we tried to solve all our problems through mental efforts.

00:18:58.731 --> 00:19:01.152
Anything – take your politics, take your economics

00:19:01.352 --> 00:19:03.430
– is nothing but a mental effort.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:06.680
For example, economics says that wants,

00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:08.971
in general, are not satiable.

00:19:09.535 --> 00:19:12.909
That means there must be some wants that are satiable

00:19:13.109 --> 00:19:16.093
and we live in the relative wants which are not satiable.

00:19:16.293 --> 00:19:18.085
Now what is that want

00:19:18.285 --> 00:19:21.873
which is absolute, which will satisfy us?

00:19:22.073 --> 00:19:24.892
And that want is represented here

00:19:25.092 --> 00:19:27.763
as this triangular.

00:19:29.006 --> 00:19:30.803
In the triangular bone you can see

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:34.541
the Kundalini that is the pure desire within you,

00:19:34.741 --> 00:19:37.620
the pure desire to be one with the Divine.

00:19:37.820 --> 00:19:40.785
Unless and until that desire manifests,

00:19:40.985 --> 00:19:43.966
all your wants will be changing from one to another.

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:46.137
Like today, you would like to have a house,

00:19:46.337 --> 00:19:48.001
tomorrow you would like to have a car

00:19:48.201 --> 00:19:49.770
and day after tomorrow something else,

00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:52.922
then a helicopter, then an
aeroplane – you can go on like that.

00:19:53.122 --> 00:19:55.278
But actually to have

00:19:55.478 --> 00:19:57.540
all your wants satisfied

00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.508
there is one want

00:19:59.775 --> 00:20:02.196
which is kept sleeping, as they say,

00:20:02.396 --> 00:20:06.068
because it has not manifested in the triangular bone

00:20:06.799 --> 00:20:08.412
which is to be awakened,

00:20:08.612 --> 00:20:10.249
which is to be manifested.

00:20:10.449 --> 00:20:13.958
Now, just imagine this bone is called as sacrum.

00:20:14.158 --> 00:20:17.193
It means Greeks also knew that it is a sacred bone.

00:20:17.393 --> 00:20:18.996
That is why they call it as sacrum.

00:20:19.196 --> 00:20:21.613
You can see the rising of the Kundalini,

00:20:21.813 --> 00:20:25.551
you can see the pulsation of the Kundalini, you can feel the

00:20:27.228 --> 00:20:30.563
percussion of the Kundalini like,
“Lub, dub, lub, dub,” as the Heart is.

00:20:30.763 --> 00:20:32.418
In some people it is quite a lot

00:20:32.618 --> 00:20:33.993
and then you can feel the

00:20:34.193 --> 00:20:36.443
cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:20:36.643 --> 00:20:38.551
Now what is this Kundalini within us?

00:20:38.751 --> 00:20:40.652
The Spirit is in your Heart

00:20:40.852 --> 00:20:43.324
but what about the Kundalini? Who is She?

00:20:43.524 --> 00:20:45.340
She is the Holy Ghost.

00:20:45.540 --> 00:20:49.340
She is the representation or the reflection of the Holy Ghost.

00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:51.013
But if you ask anybody else

00:20:51.213 --> 00:20:54.035
they say, “No, we don’t know about Holy Ghost. It’s a mystery.”

00:20:54.235 --> 00:20:57.543
In Sahaja Yoga, nothing is a mystery. Everything can be explained.

00:20:57.743 --> 00:20:59.839
Now what is the Holy Ghost is?

00:21:00.039 --> 00:21:02.540
The Holy Ghost is the primordial Mother.

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:05.626
It's the Mother, primordial Mother.

00:21:05.826 --> 00:21:09.612
But people never talked about Mother.
They talked of the Father and the Son.

00:21:09.812 --> 00:21:13.397
Now imagine, a father and a son and no mother.

00:21:14.350 --> 00:21:15.850
It is absurd.

00:21:16.062 --> 00:21:19.646
Have you seen any father and a son without a mother?

00:21:20.506 --> 00:21:22.544
Such an absurd situation comes in

00:21:22.745 --> 00:21:23.976
that people accepted

00:21:24.176 --> 00:21:26.696
because it’s all mental. Somebody tells you, “No, it’s a mystery,

00:21:26.896 --> 00:21:29.101
there’s no Mother,” and people accepted it.

00:21:29.301 --> 00:21:30.684
But there has to be a Mother

00:21:30.884 --> 00:21:32.766
and this is the time of Aquarius

00:21:32.966 --> 00:21:34.905
what we call in Sanskrit as Kumbha,

00:21:35.105 --> 00:21:38.874
meaning the Aquarius is the Kundalini,

00:21:39.074 --> 00:21:40.674
where She nourishes,

00:21:41.046 --> 00:21:43.713
where She cures you, She redeems you,

00:21:43.913 --> 00:21:45.466
She guides you, counsels you

00:21:45.666 --> 00:21:47.901
– and this is the time of the Mother.

00:21:48.101 --> 00:21:50.994
We had the time of the Father, then of the Son,

00:21:51.194 --> 00:21:53.530
and now this is the time of the Mother

00:21:53.730 --> 00:21:55.241
where She has to nourish you,

00:21:55.441 --> 00:21:56.956
where She has to take you

00:21:57.156 --> 00:21:59.862
to your ultimate goal that is the Spirit.

00:22:02.225 --> 00:22:03.652
The consciousness itself,

00:22:03.852 --> 00:22:06.525
the way we have been moving in other directions, have been

00:22:06.725 --> 00:22:09.345
like people think that if

00:22:09.545 --> 00:22:12.072
a woman starts fighting for her life

00:22:13.155 --> 00:22:16.255
and then she’s asserting the femininity.

00:22:16.455 --> 00:22:17.855
She’s not.

00:22:20.043 --> 00:22:21.839
What I’m saying is not

00:22:22.039 --> 00:22:25.080
meant for women or men. It is meant for every one of us,

00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.394
that we have to become like a mother.

00:22:29.752 --> 00:22:31.432
Like a Divine Mother,

00:22:31.744 --> 00:22:34.485
like a person who can nourish people,

00:22:35.060 --> 00:22:38.872
who can give them love, affection,

00:22:39.072 --> 00:22:43.012
attention, perseverance, forebearing.

00:22:44.238 --> 00:22:46.836
This is only possible for a mother to do it

00:22:47.036 --> 00:22:50.375
and that motherhood should be awakened in every human being.

00:22:50.575 --> 00:22:52.720
I would say Abraham Lincoln you had

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.000
was a great person like that.

00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:58.732
After that also we have had so many great people in this world

00:22:58.932 --> 00:23:02.469
who have been like that. In our country we had Mahatma Gandhi.

00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:06.017
We had many people of that temperament

00:23:06.217 --> 00:23:08.252
who were soothing,

00:23:08.452 --> 00:23:10.932
nourishing, curing

00:23:11.132 --> 00:23:13.080
and helping others

00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:15.052
in such a way as a mother

00:23:15.252 --> 00:23:17.666
would like to nourish her own children.

00:23:17.931 --> 00:23:20.358
So the sense of nourishment has to come within us

00:23:20.558 --> 00:23:22.486
but we have no power of nourishment

00:23:22.686 --> 00:23:23.974
and that only comes

00:23:24.174 --> 00:23:27.028
when your Spirit starts manifesting through you.

00:23:27.228 --> 00:23:30.172
When this Power rises, She manifests

00:23:30.372 --> 00:23:32.473
Her power of nourishment.

00:23:32.673 --> 00:23:35.258
She actually nourishes your chakras,

00:23:35.458 --> 00:23:38.274
She’s the one who nourishes those subtle centers

00:23:38.474 --> 00:23:41.580
which look after the gross centers,

00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:43.302
She’s the one who cures,

00:23:43.502 --> 00:23:45.716
She is the one who guides

00:23:45.916 --> 00:23:49.160
because She informs you what’s wrong with you

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.429
and She’s the one who councils you.

00:23:51.629 --> 00:23:54.347
Because once you become collectively conscious

00:23:54.547 --> 00:23:57.461
then you start feeling the cool breeze in your hand

00:23:57.661 --> 00:23:59.720
and this becomes like a computer.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:03.549
You become a computer of which you become the master.

00:24:03.749 --> 00:24:06.033
You are already a computer, if you understand,

00:24:06.233 --> 00:24:09.369
because in a computer if you put something in it,

00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:12.937
it cannot just see and say, it has to think.

00:24:13.137 --> 00:24:15.718
But we can just see and say things.

00:24:16.046 --> 00:24:18.026
As soon as you see, we know what it is.

00:24:18.226 --> 00:24:20.093
So we are already a wonderful computer,

00:24:20.293 --> 00:24:22.245
which no scientist can produce.

00:24:22.445 --> 00:24:24.220
But we become even

00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:25.820
conscious of that computer

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:28.091
and become master of that computer

00:24:28.292 --> 00:24:31.179
so that we know everything about

00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:35.190
whatever is not known to us unknown. All absolute problems

00:24:35.390 --> 00:24:38.910
can be asked and we can find out what’s wrong with you.

00:24:39.336 --> 00:24:42.482
But it is not that the consciousness moves like a pendulum.

00:24:42.682 --> 00:24:46.400
Like a woman fighting a man

00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:49.465
and becoming egoistical and fighting and shouting

00:24:49.665 --> 00:24:51.650
and then behaving like a man.

00:24:51.850 --> 00:24:54.657
Or a man becoming like a woman. It’s a pendulum.

00:24:54.892 --> 00:24:57.308
But you move in a spiral way,

00:24:57.683 --> 00:25:00.581
in a spiral way to rise higher

00:25:00.781 --> 00:25:03.530
and that higher point you start seeing the things.

00:25:03.730 --> 00:25:07.373
Like a spring has a spiral you have
seen and it has a sustenance within it.

00:25:07.573 --> 00:25:08.786
It’s not linear.

00:25:08.986 --> 00:25:11.806
When the spring loses its sustenance it has become linear.

00:25:12.006 --> 00:25:15.214
Like in the peptones in the pancreas

00:25:15.414 --> 00:25:17.447
are all spiraling…

00:25:17.647 --> 00:25:21.348
and human beings, though they have created so many peptones

00:25:21.548 --> 00:25:24.060
with all kinds of amino acids and all that put into it,

00:25:24.260 --> 00:25:27.028
they are not even five percent

00:25:27.231 --> 00:25:29.623
equal to what natural peptones we have.

00:25:29.823 --> 00:25:33.404
But we make them linear by our wrong doings

00:25:33.604 --> 00:25:35.635
and then the peptones become linear

00:25:35.835 --> 00:25:38.358
and they lose their biological effects

00:25:38.558 --> 00:25:40.584
because they become lifeless.

00:25:40.803 --> 00:25:43.631
In the same way our ascent

00:25:43.831 --> 00:25:45.890
takes place in a spiral way

00:25:46.090 --> 00:25:48.601
and rises higher than ones where it is.

00:25:48.801 --> 00:25:50.418
It doesn’t move like a pendulum: a man

00:25:50.618 --> 00:25:52.835
becoming a woman, a woman becoming like a man.

00:25:53.035 --> 00:25:56.359
But what happens is you develop a higher consciousness

00:25:56.559 --> 00:25:59.473
and in that higher consciousness you start

00:25:59.673 --> 00:26:02.852
understanding that now you have become the light.

00:26:03.837 --> 00:26:05.348
Now what is the light?

00:26:05.548 --> 00:26:08.571
Still you have to make the light, you work hard, you put it right.

00:26:08.771 --> 00:26:11.489
But once it has made the light, you put it on top.

00:26:11.689 --> 00:26:13.189
So it guides.

00:26:13.548 --> 00:26:15.191
Then it becomes the guru,

00:26:15.391 --> 00:26:17.440
it becomes the guiding factor.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:21.272
It becomes everything. That’s how you become.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.190
So we have got the left side of desire

00:26:24.390 --> 00:26:26.100
and the right side of action.

00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:29.878
These left side and right side of action can be compared

00:26:31.346 --> 00:26:33.362
with the brake and

00:26:33.562 --> 00:26:37.468
the accelerator in a car, to understand it on a very gross

00:26:39.104 --> 00:26:40.503
example.

00:26:40.703 --> 00:26:42.499
What happens that when we start

00:26:42.699 --> 00:26:44.857
learning how to drive,

00:26:45.163 --> 00:26:46.534
we get into the car,

00:26:46.734 --> 00:26:49.356
we use both these powers,

00:26:49.556 --> 00:26:51.319
trying to balance ourselves, first of all.

00:26:51.519 --> 00:26:54.397
Balance the car is very important and

00:26:54.597 --> 00:26:57.859
when we have learned how to use these two forces,

00:26:58.059 --> 00:27:00.351
then we think we have become drivers.

00:27:00.551 --> 00:27:02.842
At that time, we do it automatically.

00:27:03.042 --> 00:27:04.570
We don’t think about it.

00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:08.432
That’s what happens to you that first, when Kundalini rises

00:27:08.632 --> 00:27:12.242
above this center, you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:27:12.442 --> 00:27:14.940
That means there is no thought, but you are

00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.996
completely aware and alert.

00:27:18.114 --> 00:27:19.840
And when

00:27:20.809 --> 00:27:22.734
this rises from here,

00:27:23.012 --> 00:27:27.012
here is the seat of the Spirit though
the seat resides in human beings in the Heart.

00:27:27.363 --> 00:27:30.011
When it touches the seat of the Spirit

00:27:30.211 --> 00:27:34.156
then the master who’s sitting at the back seat

00:27:35.328 --> 00:27:36.828
watching you,

00:27:37.265 --> 00:27:38.730
you become the master

00:27:38.930 --> 00:27:42.414
and you start watching these two forces within you,

00:27:43.398 --> 00:27:46.463
how it is acting and also the driver

00:27:46.663 --> 00:27:48.812
within you and you become the master.

00:27:49.012 --> 00:27:51.867
This is the second stage into which you arrive.

00:27:52.308 --> 00:27:53.760
Now when we

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:56.644
become thoughtlessly aware what happens is

00:27:56.844 --> 00:27:59.742
that a thought rises and falls off

00:27:59.942 --> 00:28:03.378
and another thought rises and falls off

00:28:03.746 --> 00:28:07.388
and in the center of the two thoughts

00:28:07.701 --> 00:28:09.380
is a little area.

00:28:09.842 --> 00:28:12.772
Now these thoughts may arise

00:28:12.972 --> 00:28:15.341
from the future or from the past

00:28:16.123 --> 00:28:18.928
and the central part is the present.

00:28:19.128 --> 00:28:23.080
So when the Kundalini rises
what happens is that you’ve become

00:28:23.283 --> 00:28:25.589
stationed in the present

00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:27.467
where there is no thought.

00:28:27.667 --> 00:28:30.065
If I say you stand on the present you cannot be

00:28:30.265 --> 00:28:32.331
because we are on the future or on the past

00:28:32.531 --> 00:28:33.757
because there were thoughts.

00:28:33.957 --> 00:28:37.332
But when the thoughts are removed you stand

00:28:37.754 --> 00:28:40.570
in the center of those two thoughts

00:28:40.770 --> 00:28:42.746
and you’ve become

00:28:42.946 --> 00:28:45.577
thoughtlessly aware.

00:28:45.777 --> 00:28:47.102
and this state

00:28:47.302 --> 00:28:49.238
is such a wonderful state

00:28:49.438 --> 00:28:51.524
that at that time whatever you see

00:28:51.724 --> 00:28:53.620
becomes a picture memory,

00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.185
not only as a memory,

00:28:55.385 --> 00:28:58.237
but the joy of creation starts pouring into you.

00:28:58.437 --> 00:29:00.968
You start understanding the joy of creation

00:29:01.168 --> 00:29:03.850
and lots of powers you start manifesting

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.277
that at this time you can cure people,

00:29:07.738 --> 00:29:09.183
you can heal them

00:29:09.383 --> 00:29:12.105
– physically, maybe mentally also.

00:29:12.355 --> 00:29:14.110
But that’s not enough.

00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:16.942
In that also you should not get lost.

00:29:17.142 --> 00:29:19.572
Some people do it by some other forces

00:29:19.772 --> 00:29:20.959
which are spirits.

00:29:21.159 --> 00:29:24.805
What they do is to put some spirits
into a person, take out some spirits,

00:29:25.005 --> 00:29:26.359
transfer some spirits they do.

00:29:26.559 --> 00:29:30.015
This is absolutely a different
area into which we don’t have to go.

00:29:30.215 --> 00:29:32.375
We have to do everything

00:29:33.079 --> 00:29:35.000
which is complete Spirit,

00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:38.099
ourselves masters, knowing everything

00:29:38.299 --> 00:29:39.742
about what you are doing.

00:29:39.942 --> 00:29:42.500
We are never under the blanket, no darkness.

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:45.452
You see everything, what you are doing, what you are getting,

00:29:45.652 --> 00:29:48.079
these powers that are flowing through your hand,

00:29:48.279 --> 00:29:50.484
you know what exactly they mean.

00:29:50.684 --> 00:29:52.137
They are all recorded for you,

00:29:52.337 --> 00:29:55.132
you don’t have to research
it and you can only verify it.

00:29:55.332 --> 00:29:56.732
Like the gentleman

00:29:56.932 --> 00:30:00.012
who got his realization

00:30:00.212 --> 00:30:03.122
from me and then he said,

00:30:03.322 --> 00:30:06.390
“Mother, I can’t believe I can be collectively conscious

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:09.958
because you see the brains here are working a bit too much,

00:30:10.158 --> 00:30:12.153
The Heart is less, the brain is too much.

00:30:12.353 --> 00:30:15.406
There’s an imbalance between the Heart and the brain.

00:30:15.606 --> 00:30:17.632
So I said, “All right, try with your brain.

00:30:17.832 --> 00:30:20.828
By asking you can verify.”

00:30:21.028 --> 00:30:22.841
He said. “I want to know -

00:30:25.213 --> 00:30:27.918
“Please find out, how is the”

00:30:28.832 --> 00:30:31.496
He said. “I want to find out: How is my father?”

00:30:31.696 --> 00:30:34.243
I said, “All right, you just put your hands like this

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.450
and try to find out how is your father.”

00:30:37.650 --> 00:30:39.743
So he says, “Mother, I’m getting a very

00:30:39.943 --> 00:30:43.876
great heat here and it's burning, a very funny feeling here.

00:30:44.756 --> 00:30:48.756
So I said, “All right, if that
is so, these are all the centers

00:30:49.046 --> 00:30:51.187
that are indicating your father

00:30:51.387 --> 00:30:53.174
and if it is in this

00:30:53.374 --> 00:30:55.108
finger you are feeling,

00:30:55.859 --> 00:30:58.491
then you must know that he must be down

00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:00.300
with very bad bronchitis

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:03.971
because this finger denotes this center here.”

00:31:04.347 --> 00:31:06.788
So he telephoned his father in my place

00:31:06.988 --> 00:31:09.498
and his mother came to the phone and she said

00:31:09.698 --> 00:31:12.635
he is down with very bad bronchitis

00:31:12.835 --> 00:31:14.834
– The same sentence she used.

00:31:15.034 --> 00:31:17.034
So that’s how you can feel it.

00:31:17.375 --> 00:31:19.812
You must know that in the realm of God

00:31:20.012 --> 00:31:21.835
we are really fantastic.

00:31:22.035 --> 00:31:24.026
We have to enter into the realm of God,

00:31:24.226 --> 00:31:26.170
we have to become the citizen of God’s realm.

00:31:26.370 --> 00:31:29.240
Then only be amazed that He has

00:31:29.444 --> 00:31:31.435
the greatest capacity,

00:31:32.131 --> 00:31:34.732
that you cannot imagine how dynamically it is,

00:31:34.932 --> 00:31:37.212
how it works. There have been so many

00:31:37.412 --> 00:31:39.044
incidents in Sahaja Yoga

00:31:39.244 --> 00:31:40.959
that people can tell you sometimes

00:31:41.159 --> 00:31:43.613
how miracles after miracles have taken place

00:31:43.813 --> 00:31:46.292
which they cannot explain how it has worked out.

00:31:46.492 --> 00:31:49.653
Not miracles like getting a diamond and giving it.

00:31:49.853 --> 00:31:53.741
One should understand that those people who go after diamonds

00:31:54.022 --> 00:31:55.853
are not the people who are seeking God.

00:31:56.053 --> 00:31:58.438
They want diamonds they can get it in the market.

00:31:58.638 --> 00:32:01.556
Some people who start jumping, they think they have become godly.

00:32:01.756 --> 00:32:04.516
How can it be? Are you going to become frogs now?

00:32:04.716 --> 00:32:08.141
We should understand also
logically what is going to happen to us,

00:32:08.341 --> 00:32:11.114
that we are going to be empowered by a power

00:32:11.314 --> 00:32:13.352
which we should know how to handle.

00:32:13.552 --> 00:32:15.343
Otherwise no use

00:32:15.543 --> 00:32:17.785
doing all these tricks these days people are doing.

00:32:17.985 --> 00:32:19.492
Some peoples are just jumping,

00:32:19.692 --> 00:32:22.532
some start shouting, screaming, some becoming dogs,

00:32:22.732 --> 00:32:24.445
some becoming like a lion.

00:32:24.645 --> 00:32:26.572
You are not to go to your subconscious now

00:32:26.772 --> 00:32:28.823
because God has placed so beautifully.

00:32:29.023 --> 00:32:32.452
Your subconscious is on
the left hand side and your

00:32:32.652 --> 00:32:34.644
right side is your future.

00:32:35.027 --> 00:32:37.558
So there is a room kept for you in the center,

00:32:37.758 --> 00:32:39.249
like you have made a home here,

00:32:39.449 --> 00:32:41.359
like there was a room there.

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:45.535
But the idea of the psychologists here was so confused

00:32:45.754 --> 00:32:48.815
that some of the Indians maybe have taken

00:32:49.015 --> 00:32:50.366
a little clue from that,

00:32:50.566 --> 00:32:52.573
and they have come here to take you down

00:32:52.773 --> 00:32:54.900
to subconscious, which is the easiest thing to do

00:32:55.100 --> 00:32:56.959
is to take down to your subconscious.

00:32:57.159 --> 00:32:58.764
That’s what they have done.

00:32:58.964 --> 00:33:00.433
They have mesmerized people,

00:33:00.633 --> 00:33:03.245
started these cults and these false gurus have come

00:33:03.445 --> 00:33:06.372
and they are just doing nothing
but taking you to your subconscious

00:33:06.572 --> 00:33:09.778
where you get caught up and
possessed by the collective subconscious,

00:33:09.978 --> 00:33:13.126
and you think you are in the best

00:33:13.326 --> 00:33:15.484
position but you don’t know where you are moving.

00:33:15.684 --> 00:33:17.184
You have no idea.

00:33:19.799 --> 00:33:23.799
So the best thing for us is to see

00:33:25.334 --> 00:33:28.550
what we get ourselves,

00:33:28.754 --> 00:33:30.874
what we know ourselves.

00:33:31.074 --> 00:33:32.822
Some people have given six thousand,

00:33:33.022 --> 00:33:35.513
some people have given fifteen thousand.

00:33:35.713 --> 00:33:37.997
But for what are you giving money?

00:33:38.505 --> 00:33:40.844
It is something I can’t understand.

00:33:41.044 --> 00:33:43.012
I came about ten years back

00:33:43.212 --> 00:33:45.160
to your great country, America,

00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:48.778
and they couldn’t understand me
when I said you cannot pay money for this

00:33:48.978 --> 00:33:50.559
and they threw me out, you see.

00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:52.094
They wouldn’t take me seriously.

00:33:52.294 --> 00:33:54.735
They said, “Oh, what are you talking? It’s nonsense.

00:33:54.935 --> 00:33:58.120
How can you do some things without money?”

00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:01.402
So this is what it is. But I think after ten years

00:34:01.602 --> 00:34:04.606
of good lashing from these people they have learned a lesson now.

00:34:04.806 --> 00:34:08.082
They’re coming around and now they have been kind to me.

00:34:08.282 --> 00:34:11.345
So you must understand one has to be humble about it.

00:34:11.545 --> 00:34:15.271
It’s only the ego that makes you think that you can purchase God,

00:34:15.745 --> 00:34:17.151
that you can organize Him,

00:34:17.351 --> 00:34:20.116
that you can organize God, organize religion,

00:34:20.316 --> 00:34:21.870
organize all that is Divine.

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:23.917
You cannot organize, as I told you,

00:34:24.117 --> 00:34:26.670
the changing of one flower into a fruit.

00:34:26.870 --> 00:34:30.552
Then it is, too much to think that you can organize thought.

00:34:30.752 --> 00:34:34.030
We must humble down within ourselves and that’s how it works out.

00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:36.146
It works out, it has worked in thousands

00:34:36.346 --> 00:34:37.750
and should work out everywhere.

00:34:37.950 --> 00:34:40.605
I’m sure in Boston also it should work out.

00:34:40.805 --> 00:34:44.278
But there are categories and categories of people that I must admit.

00:34:44.478 --> 00:34:47.164
For example, Steve, I must say, is a special category.

00:34:47.364 --> 00:34:49.898
He met me only once in Bristol.

00:34:50.098 --> 00:34:52.736
One program he had come, just as all you have come,

00:34:52.936 --> 00:34:55.122
then he came to see me next day.

00:34:55.522 --> 00:34:58.335
Actually person to person, he met me only once

00:34:58.535 --> 00:35:00.196
and then he said he has to go to Boston.

00:35:00.396 --> 00:35:02.204
I said, “A very good idea. Go to Boston

00:35:02.404 --> 00:35:04.433
and I hope I meet you there.”

00:35:04.633 --> 00:35:06.052
When I came to America

00:35:06.252 --> 00:35:08.442
two years back he just sent me a telegram.

00:35:08.642 --> 00:35:11.643
He said, “Mother, I’m in Boston.
Will you come here we’ll have a program.”

00:35:11.843 --> 00:35:14.013
He was occupying a small little room

00:35:14.213 --> 00:35:15.693
and sweetly

00:35:15.893 --> 00:35:18.371
he invited me there and I said, “All right, I’m going to Boston.”

00:35:18.571 --> 00:35:22.110
People said, “Mother, you don’t know
him very well.” I said, “I know him very well.

00:35:22.310 --> 00:35:23.267
I’m going.”

00:35:23.467 --> 00:35:27.251
I came here and we had a program in Boston and today

00:35:27.451 --> 00:35:30.229
because of the quality of people who are running it,

00:35:30.429 --> 00:35:32.358
we have a nice proper center

00:35:32.558 --> 00:35:36.225
where now many people can get their realization and settle down.

00:35:36.425 --> 00:35:39.544
But there are categories of very egoistical people also,

00:35:39.744 --> 00:35:41.014
of very funny people.

00:35:41.214 --> 00:35:44.912
Like some people in the church came
to hit me with the Bible. You can imagine

00:35:45.112 --> 00:35:48.274
in the church they came to hit me with the Bible, no other place

00:35:48.474 --> 00:35:50.071
and all such people are there.

00:35:50.271 --> 00:35:53.476
But those people who are of that category

00:35:53.676 --> 00:35:57.320
are the best who get their realization in no time and settle down.

00:35:57.520 --> 00:35:59.449
Some people have physical problems

00:35:59.649 --> 00:36:02.052
and that’s why also they cannot get realization.

00:36:02.252 --> 00:36:06.051
But the people who have been to false
gurus and have bent their heads before them

00:36:06.251 --> 00:36:07.621
also are very difficult.

00:36:07.821 --> 00:36:10.317
They have to be a little
bit patient with them,

00:36:10.517 --> 00:36:13.599
first of all, to neutralize the effects of this falsehood

00:36:13.799 --> 00:36:15.300
and then they get realization.

00:36:15.500 --> 00:36:18.977
But some of them – I was amazed the other day in Toronto

00:36:19.177 --> 00:36:21.356
– I gave realization to some people

00:36:21.556 --> 00:36:24.494
who have been to those gurus
and they just threw away everything

00:36:24.694 --> 00:36:28.243
because they had reached the right
conclusion that they had not found the Truth

00:36:28.443 --> 00:36:31.495
They had not found the Truth and
they had just thrown away everything apart

00:36:31.695 --> 00:36:33.400
and they got their realization, too.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:36.259
So we have people and people. We have people

00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.876
who come into Sahaja Yoga all soft
and then they become very violent,

00:36:40.401 --> 00:36:42.870
very hot tempered, they are

00:36:43.504 --> 00:36:46.741
not so well organized and you find

00:36:46.941 --> 00:36:49.541
that their temperament doesn’t look like a realized soul.

00:36:49.741 --> 00:36:51.795
But all kinds of people come to Sahaja Yoga

00:36:51.995 --> 00:36:53.957
and the negative people will always see

00:36:54.157 --> 00:36:57.339
the people who are at the lower end and see them and start

00:36:57.566 --> 00:36:59.800
criticizing or, “Look at him. He’s a sahaja yogi.”

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:03.904
A sahaja yogi is a person who has achieved a balance in them,

00:37:04.679 --> 00:37:08.206
a person who has achieved a mastery over Kundalini,

00:37:08.406 --> 00:37:11.281
the one who has all the knowledge how to raise the Kundalini

00:37:11.481 --> 00:37:12.879
and how to give realization.

00:37:13.079 --> 00:37:15.393
A sahaja yogi is not every Tom, Dick and Harry.

00:37:15.593 --> 00:37:16.917
This one, one should understand,

00:37:17.117 --> 00:37:20.632
but everybody comes to Sahaja
Yoga. Everybody is allowed to come.

00:37:20.832 --> 00:37:23.596
We have all kinds of people, all types of people.

00:37:23.796 --> 00:37:26.553
But the sahaja yogis are a special category

00:37:26.753 --> 00:37:28.118
who mature

00:37:28.318 --> 00:37:31.734
like a seed which is just sprouted, has to be looked after

00:37:31.934 --> 00:37:34.621
very tenderly, carefully, respectfully

00:37:34.821 --> 00:37:36.675
and then it grows into a big tree

00:37:36.875 --> 00:37:39.818
and when it becomes the tree nobody has to be told,

00:37:40.018 --> 00:37:42.730
you don’t have to tell them by oath that this is a tree.

00:37:42.930 --> 00:37:44.898
Everyone knows this is a tree.

00:37:45.098 --> 00:37:46.914
So this is how it works out:

00:37:47.114 --> 00:37:50.332
Those people who are positive about it get it

00:37:50.532 --> 00:37:52.110
into their heads, first of all,

00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:53.688
and then into their Hearts.

00:37:53.888 --> 00:37:56.190
I’m sure it will work out even here

00:37:56.390 --> 00:37:57.872
and there are so many people here

00:37:58.072 --> 00:37:59.620
it should work out with all of you.

00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.449
I didn’t know that the program is only for two days. In any case,

00:38:03.773 --> 00:38:06.652
two days I’ll be here, that is today and tomorrow.

00:38:06.852 --> 00:38:09.761
In the short time whatever is possible I’ve tried to cover.

00:38:09.961 --> 00:38:12.740
But it's, The knowledge is like an ocean.

00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:14.492
But you become the knowledge itself

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:16.523
which I’ll tell you how you’ll become the knowledge

00:38:16.723 --> 00:38:20.389
and you don’t have to listen to
too many lectures to understand me.

00:38:20.733 --> 00:38:22.295
But as far as I am concerned

00:38:22.495 --> 00:38:25.998
I’ve been lecturing and lecturing for the last ten years

00:38:26.198 --> 00:38:29.692
and in London if you see there are thousands of lectures of mine

00:38:29.892 --> 00:38:32.087
which you can see for yourself.

00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.713
This happens much better in a place

00:38:34.913 --> 00:38:38.120
where people are not so complicated. Thousands of

00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:41.271
them can get realization. People who are here have seen

00:38:41.471 --> 00:38:45.068
thousands of Indian villagers get their realization.

00:38:45.268 --> 00:38:48.330
But maybe people are much more

00:38:48.530 --> 00:38:50.600
oppressed by the

00:38:51.189 --> 00:38:53.288
modern society, modern ideas.

00:38:53.488 --> 00:38:56.538
Maybe that they take a little time to grow, but doesn’t matter.

00:38:56.738 --> 00:38:59.695
You are people of great adventure

00:38:59.895 --> 00:39:01.664
and people of great qualities.

00:39:01.864 --> 00:39:03.302
You are saintly people,

00:39:03.502 --> 00:39:06.486
you are men of God who are born in these countries, all over.

00:39:06.686 --> 00:39:09.825
Even in England I saw so many people who are men of God

00:39:10.025 --> 00:39:11.548
and as William Blake has said,

00:39:11.748 --> 00:39:14.893
that Men of God will become prophets,

00:39:15.093 --> 00:39:17.680
and they will have powers
to make others prophets.”

00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:19.360
That’s what you have to have.

00:39:19.560 --> 00:39:21.965
So many of you are saints, that’s why you are born

00:39:22.165 --> 00:39:24.203
in such a nice country like America.

00:39:24.403 --> 00:39:26.134
It’s such a highly blessed country.

00:39:26.334 --> 00:39:28.573
Is such a great, beautiful country

00:39:28.773 --> 00:39:32.593
and then you have to make the best out of it.

00:39:32.835 --> 00:39:34.335
May God bless you.

00:39:38.659 --> 00:39:41.459
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

00:39:57.975 --> 00:39:59.975
Was that audible?

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.925
Seeker: I would like to know God

00:40:08.353 --> 00:40:11.708
and I do pray to Him

00:40:13.576 --> 00:40:16.712
and what you said right there that this is the Christ center here.

00:40:18.835 --> 00:40:21.239
How long would it take for me to know?

00:40:36.083 --> 00:40:37.925
Shri Mataji: Split of a second.

00:40:39.471 --> 00:40:42.815
Split of a second. And

00:40:44.449 --> 00:40:47.324
it will happen in a split of a second, no doubt.

00:40:47.524 --> 00:40:49.503
But nothing is guaranteed.

00:40:49.864 --> 00:40:51.972
You cannot say if all the seeds

00:40:52.172 --> 00:40:54.140
will sprout at the same time,

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:57.156
but it is guaranteed that it will

00:40:57.356 --> 00:40:59.588
ultimately, alright.

00:40:59.788 --> 00:41:01.393
There is no time for God.

00:41:01.593 --> 00:41:03.273
God does not know time.

00:41:12.565 --> 00:41:14.165
Warren: Any other questions?

00:41:18.157 --> 00:41:19.493
Shri Mataji: Please stand up.

00:41:19.693 --> 00:41:22.548
Seeker: Say you become enlighten

00:41:24.326 --> 00:41:27.028
and you see things

00:41:30.831 --> 00:41:33.361
together consciousness and

00:41:33.561 --> 00:41:36.972
what happens to you after

00:41:37.172 --> 00:41:40.588
you physically die? What after that?

00:41:52.802 --> 00:41:54.959
Shri Mataji: Yo see that, you should not be futuristic.

00:41:55.159 --> 00:41:57.284
Why do you want to think of death, I'm talking of life?

00:41:57.484 --> 00:41:59.446
I’ve given a big lecture on that.

00:41:59.646 --> 00:42:01.372
You can take a tape and hear about it,

00:42:01.572 --> 00:42:04.260
but just now we’re talking about life, not about death, all right.

00:42:04.460 --> 00:42:05.732
You are a realized soul.

00:42:05.932 --> 00:42:10.092
If you want, you can take your birth again,
do what you like. You are a free bird after your death.

00:42:10.292 --> 00:42:12.041
There’s nothing like death after that,

00:42:12.241 --> 00:42:13.907
because you entered into a realm

00:42:14.107 --> 00:42:16.384
where there is no death. You know you are dying

00:42:16.584 --> 00:42:20.311
and changing this body and you can take the body again.

00:42:20.545 --> 00:42:23.530
It’s a very different awareness, all right.

00:42:29.093 --> 00:42:32.070
Seeker: Do you need faith in order to know God?

00:42:34.990 --> 00:42:36.224
Shri Mataji: No, not at all.

00:42:36.424 --> 00:42:38.759
You see faith, if it means blind faith,

00:42:38.959 --> 00:42:41.007
on the contrary, it’s very dangerous.

00:42:41.207 --> 00:42:43.181
Those people who have blind faith

00:42:43.381 --> 00:42:45.256
are very dangerous people because

00:42:45.456 --> 00:42:47.764
they are really bound to a certain mental

00:42:47.964 --> 00:42:49.416
aspect of it, you see.

00:42:49.616 --> 00:42:52.963
And they are bound to some sort of a mental conception,

00:42:53.163 --> 00:42:56.192
that this is God, this is God, this is God, is wrong.

00:42:56.392 --> 00:42:57.959
But you must have an open mind.

00:42:58.159 --> 00:42:59.299
Even if you deny,

00:42:59.499 --> 00:43:02.039
then it’s not proper because you keep your mind open.

00:43:02.239 --> 00:43:03.836
It is like sunshine.

00:43:04.036 --> 00:43:05.612
If you are facing the sunshine

00:43:05.812 --> 00:43:07.440
you will be affected by sunshine,

00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:09.465
but if you hide yourself from sunshine,

00:43:09.665 --> 00:43:12.046
the sunshine is not going to run after.

00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:18.207
Seeker: Who taught you your technique,

00:43:18.407 --> 00:43:21.783
you said that you need a light to light another light?

00:43:29.284 --> 00:43:30.784
Shri Mataji: Nobody.

00:43:31.244 --> 00:43:34.412
You better know me when you are enlightened.

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:37.320
You see the thing is, I don’t want to talk about myself.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:38.580
The trouble is,

00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:42.170
Christ just said that He was the Son of God, all right

00:43:42.370 --> 00:43:43.885
and they crucified Him.

00:43:44.085 --> 00:43:45.844
That’s a fact. He was.

00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:47.874
But they crucified him

00:43:48.074 --> 00:43:50.941
and I don’t want to talk about
myself till you have your enlightenment.

00:43:51.141 --> 00:43:52.892
When you have your enlightenment,

00:43:53.092 --> 00:43:54.812
then you will know about me, all right.

00:43:55.012 --> 00:43:58.108
You better have your light first, and then you’ll know me.

00:43:58.372 --> 00:44:00.105
Otherwise, it’s difficult.

00:44:00.961 --> 00:44:03.473
I’m tactful in this lifetime.

00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:08.098
I don’t want to get crucified.

00:44:12.497 --> 00:44:14.739
Seeker: If you’ve had an operation on your lower back

00:44:14.939 --> 00:44:16.508
where the Kundalini is down there

00:44:16.708 --> 00:44:19.474
and there is pain all the time can you still have enlightenment?

00:44:19.674 --> 00:44:23.201
Shri Mataji: Yes, you can. We can
work it out, first we'll have to adjust the back.

00:44:23.401 --> 00:44:25.553
We’ll have to put it right.

00:44:25.753 --> 00:44:28.295
So many people have got it even with their

00:44:28.495 --> 00:44:30.649
back broken. Realization.

00:44:30.849 --> 00:44:34.167
First, their back is put right and they feel all right

00:44:34.367 --> 00:44:37.566
and then they get the Kundalini rising. It’s not difficult.

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:40.710
It’s a repairing system, it repairs you.

00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:44.807
But if something is dead in you, supposing you put some

00:44:45.007 --> 00:44:48.408
steel sticks into your legs, we can’t remove it, you see.

00:44:49.615 --> 00:44:53.243
If it is a dead stuff inside, we cannot help you, but if it is a living

00:44:53.443 --> 00:44:55.143
machinery, it repairs.

00:44:55.343 --> 00:44:58.943
It just gets repaired. It has to be a living thing inside.

00:45:03.907 --> 00:45:05.696
Seeker: When the Kundalini rises up,

00:45:05.896 --> 00:45:08.932
does it always maintain a position

00:45:09.132 --> 00:45:11.032
or does it ever go back down?

00:45:15.768 --> 00:45:18.176
Shri Mataji: That’s true, it goes down also, in many people.

00:45:18.376 --> 00:45:21.166
It goes down, it comes up and goes down.

00:45:21.366 --> 00:45:25.743
You see, in some people it does.
I mean, I would say that it, very much there.

00:45:25.943 --> 00:45:28.046
But with many people it goes down.

00:45:28.246 --> 00:45:29.968
And the reason why it goes down

00:45:30.168 --> 00:45:32.455
is because it comes in a flood, you see.

00:45:32.655 --> 00:45:36.078
Because it faces me, knows me. It comes up like a flood

00:45:36.278 --> 00:45:38.120
and then it goes down because

00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:41.761
you need nourishment in different centers.
Supposing you have a problem somewhere.

00:45:41.961 --> 00:45:43.132
It goes and nourishes you.

00:45:43.332 --> 00:45:46.052
Then again it nourishes. Very sweetly comes up again.

00:45:46.252 --> 00:45:47.379
But if you know,

00:45:47.579 --> 00:45:50.139
once you have touched this and it has come out of it

00:45:50.339 --> 00:45:53.433
and if you know how to raise it again and again, you can bring it up.

00:45:53.633 --> 00:45:56.100
That’s what you have to learn after realization

00:45:56.300 --> 00:45:59.368
and that is called as shuddha vidya. Means the true knowledge

00:45:59.568 --> 00:46:00.975
of divine activity.

00:46:01.175 --> 00:46:04.136
Once you know that how to
it’s very simple. You have to use only your hands.

00:46:04.336 --> 00:46:05.538
Like this you have to move it

00:46:05.738 --> 00:46:08.333
and bring it up. You have to give yourself a balance a little bit

00:46:08.533 --> 00:46:10.196
only because it’s flowing through your hands,

00:46:10.396 --> 00:46:12.468
that’s all and you can manage.

00:46:13.726 --> 00:46:16.132
It’s not difficult. You can establish it.

00:46:16.332 --> 00:46:18.092
A little bit in the beginning, about a month,

00:46:18.292 --> 00:46:20.026
you’ll have to work it out,

00:46:20.226 --> 00:46:22.283
but not all. I’m saying just

00:46:22.483 --> 00:46:25.868
a few people really get it, like you can say,

00:46:27.022 --> 00:46:30.122
Steve was like that. He got it, he got it.

00:46:32.874 --> 00:46:35.428
Seeker: Is all of this really happening?

00:46:37.741 --> 00:46:39.241
Is this real?

00:46:42.006 --> 00:46:43.506
Shri Mataji: Yeah.

00:46:48.709 --> 00:46:50.982
It is too fantastic to believe.

00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:54.697
It is happening. It has to happen sometime.

00:46:54.897 --> 00:46:57.513
God who has created this creation,

00:46:57.713 --> 00:46:59.258
He is worried

00:46:59.458 --> 00:47:02.533
and He has to look after his creation, isn’t it ?

00:47:04.643 --> 00:47:06.959
He’s anxious. It has to happen.

00:47:07.159 --> 00:47:09.874
After all, we are not responsible for this creation.

00:47:10.074 --> 00:47:13.868
He has created it, so He has to jolly well look after it.

00:47:15.135 --> 00:47:16.635
It’s happening.

00:47:16.970 --> 00:47:18.828
You can’t believe it, isn’t it?

00:47:19.181 --> 00:47:20.814
It will work out.

00:47:21.014 --> 00:47:23.209
Have faith in yourself, that’s all.

00:47:23.409 --> 00:47:25.960
You must have faith in yourself and nothing else.

00:47:30.508 --> 00:47:32.956
Seeker: While doing Sahaja Yoga techniques,

00:47:33.156 --> 00:47:34.612
which I have been taught.

00:47:34.812 --> 00:47:36.328
Is it okay to -

00:47:38.723 --> 00:47:40.996
be like a worshipper of Jesus Christ also

00:47:41.196 --> 00:47:43.715
will that interfere in anyway. And also wanna

00:47:44.738 --> 00:47:47.175
how about like in I'm a musician

00:47:47.375 --> 00:47:49.929
and the practice of my music, can that be like Bhakti Yoga,

00:47:50.129 --> 00:47:53.055
will that, I mean can I use that as a meditation?

00:47:53.255 --> 00:47:54.558
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course

00:47:54.758 --> 00:47:57.092
but you become discreet you see after that.

00:47:57.292 --> 00:47:59.965
You start understanding the music which is good for your spirit,

00:48:00.165 --> 00:48:01.885
which is not good for you, your spirit.

00:48:02.085 --> 00:48:05.120
And you become dynamic, dynamic. I mean,

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:07.868
you know about Indian music, something?

00:48:08.530 --> 00:48:10.030
Indian music.

00:48:10.909 --> 00:48:13.339
So many Indian Musicians have got realization

00:48:13.539 --> 00:48:17.015
and after realization they have become absolutely tremendous.

00:48:17.906 --> 00:48:21.532
So you become tremendous but you become discreet there.

00:48:21.732 --> 00:48:25.532
You start understanding what music will really give joy of the spirit

00:48:25.732 --> 00:48:28.341
and you start playing and the joy of the spirit is the main thing

00:48:28.541 --> 00:48:30.492
people are seeking that’s eternal music

00:48:30.692 --> 00:48:33.717
because all other types of music comes up and goes down

00:48:33.917 --> 00:48:36.508
but only the one that gives joy

00:48:36.712 --> 00:48:38.307
reminds eternally.

00:48:38.507 --> 00:48:40.132
All like those, Mozart.

00:48:40.332 --> 00:48:42.597
Mozart was a realised soul and his music

00:48:42.797 --> 00:48:44.412
gives joy to the spirit

00:48:44.612 --> 00:48:47.948
because you start feeling the vibrations when you hear him.

00:48:48.401 --> 00:48:51.892
Like artists also we can say
Michelangelo was a realised soul.

00:48:52.092 --> 00:48:55.972
When you see his paintings in the Sistine Chapel, you see.

00:48:56.172 --> 00:48:58.372
You have been to Rome.

00:48:58.572 --> 00:49:02.472
You start feeling the vibrations from that.

00:49:05.926 --> 00:49:08.877
Warren: He asked another half of the question.

00:49:09.612 --> 00:49:12.452
Can he remain worshipping the Lord Jesus Christ,

00:49:12.652 --> 00:49:14.174
once he gains his realization?

00:49:14.375 --> 00:49:17.221
Shri Mataji: Of course Lord Jesus Christ plays a very great importance

00:49:17.421 --> 00:49:19.569
but you must understand him in a full way,

00:49:19.769 --> 00:49:23.526
you should not just take it from the
Bible because the bible cannot contain Christ,

00:49:23.726 --> 00:49:26.932
it's only three and half years of his age is there.

00:49:27.132 --> 00:49:29.092
There are so many books which have described Him

00:49:29.292 --> 00:49:31.410
and you have to see what he is really,

00:49:31.610 --> 00:49:33.652
what importance he has.

00:49:33.852 --> 00:49:37.694
I wish people have gone out of
Bible and seen what great person he is.

00:49:37.894 --> 00:49:39.559
Today, you'll be surprised people

00:49:39.759 --> 00:49:42.318
like Jews, who believe in

00:49:42.518 --> 00:49:46.572
Christ very much, Muslims believe in Christ
very much, much more than Christians can believe

00:49:46.772 --> 00:49:49.479
because they are realised souls and they know whats his position

00:49:49.679 --> 00:49:51.283
in realization.

00:49:55.588 --> 00:49:59.182
Seeker: I would like to know more
about the hands, you were speaking of -

00:49:59.445 --> 00:50:01.787
I guess senses on the hands?

00:50:05.803 --> 00:50:08.406
Shri Mataji: That is all written down in the book,

00:50:08.606 --> 00:50:09.661
you will understand

00:50:09.861 --> 00:50:13.156
that these are five centers,
six and seven centers in the left hand side

00:50:13.356 --> 00:50:15.152
and the same way on the right hand side

00:50:15.352 --> 00:50:17.726
but what they do not answer in the book is there

00:50:17.926 --> 00:50:19.449
and we give the books after

00:50:19.649 --> 00:50:21.454
you have got realization, not before that.

00:50:21.654 --> 00:50:24.880
Because before that if I give the book
again you will go into mental projections.

00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:27.583
You see, so we are treating you in this way,

00:50:27.783 --> 00:50:29.236
that first you get your realization

00:50:29.436 --> 00:50:31.277
then only the first book is given

00:50:31.477 --> 00:50:34.212
because if you give the last book, it's too much for you to bear.

00:50:34.412 --> 00:50:36.419
So first book you have to read and digested it

00:50:36.619 --> 00:50:38.692
like that you have to grow really

00:50:38.892 --> 00:50:41.932
in Sahaja Yoga you have to become, there is no other interest.

00:50:42.132 --> 00:50:44.868
That you have to become so we gradually sort of

00:50:45.068 --> 00:50:48.734
make you understand it so that you can digest it.

00:50:53.795 --> 00:50:56.084
Seeker: If you're a person who

00:50:56.620 --> 00:50:59.978
can't say see things but has visions

00:51:00.178 --> 00:51:01.665
when you come under realization,

00:51:01.865 --> 00:51:04.146
will that go away or will it be stronger

00:51:04.346 --> 00:51:06.217
or will it stay or what?

00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:17.231
Shri Mataji: Visions are not all right.

00:51:17.431 --> 00:51:18.756
You should not see visions.

00:51:18.956 --> 00:51:20.659
That means you’re not normal.

00:51:20.859 --> 00:51:22.380
You’re on the right hand side.

00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:24.985
If you're on the right hand side you start seeing visions.

00:51:25.185 --> 00:51:28.420
The other day we had one boy who used to see auras and visions.

00:51:28.620 --> 00:51:31.756
But he told me his head is heavy all the time, he feels very heavy.

00:51:31.956 --> 00:51:33.663
And that he doesn’t feel all right

00:51:33.863 --> 00:51:35.218
and we had to remove that

00:51:35.418 --> 00:51:37.332
because you must see the present,

00:51:37.532 --> 00:51:39.262
the reality as it is.

00:51:39.462 --> 00:51:43.462
At the time of Christ, people started seeing visions of Moses.

00:51:44.027 --> 00:51:47.050
But Christ was there living with them every night

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:49.459
and they were thinking of Moses,

00:51:49.659 --> 00:51:52.383
they had been visions of Moses and Abraham.

00:51:52.583 --> 00:51:53.970
What about Christ who was living.

00:51:54.170 --> 00:51:55.965
Now today I am here and now you will

00:51:56.165 --> 00:51:57.876
think you are taking visions of Christ.

00:51:58.076 --> 00:52:00.737
What about me? I am here in the present.

00:52:00.937 --> 00:52:03.473
So you have to be in the present, not in the future

00:52:03.673 --> 00:52:05.554
or in the past. But when you see visions

00:52:05.754 --> 00:52:08.040
it could be from the past or from the future.

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.690
Like in India people see visions.

00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:11.900
And they have their

00:52:12.100 --> 00:52:14.856
own visions of the Devis and Goddesses and all that.

00:52:15.056 --> 00:52:16.761
And then they deny everything.

00:52:16.961 --> 00:52:18.939
They say that no, how are we to believe in

00:52:19.139 --> 00:52:21.041
Christ or his Mother or anything?

00:52:21.241 --> 00:52:22.801
But when they come to the present

00:52:23.001 --> 00:52:26.143
they understand that they were all there. They are there

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:27.556
in the present.

00:52:30.304 --> 00:52:32.219
Because you become one side.

00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:37.472
Vision is not a normal thing.

00:52:37.672 --> 00:52:40.401
It’s not very good and those people who see visions

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.401
end up into very bad life

00:52:43.601 --> 00:52:45.620
because it’s not normal.

00:52:45.820 --> 00:52:48.100
You will know gradually,
how you see visions also,

00:52:48.300 --> 00:52:52.218
what happens to you. But after realization, you just come in the center.

00:52:54.768 --> 00:52:56.492
Seeker: In Sahaja Yoga,

00:52:56.692 --> 00:53:00.416
does the Kundalini go beyond the crown chakra?

00:53:05.941 --> 00:53:07.437
Shri Mataji: Of course,

00:53:07.637 --> 00:53:09.500
it can go beyond, much beyond.

00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.320
But it depends on you seeing how you are.

00:53:12.520 --> 00:53:15.360
It has to grow. It is for the complete growth of a person.

00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:18.378
There are three centers above that which you have to cross.

00:53:18.578 --> 00:53:20.690
There are some people who have crossed it, no doubt.

00:53:20.890 --> 00:53:23.668
But they are some but you see

00:53:24.694 --> 00:53:27.514
they are a very assiduous, I should say.

00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.961
Also they are a category I should say,

00:53:32.161 --> 00:53:34.670
there are so many things about them, the quality itself.

00:53:34.870 --> 00:53:37.031
You can ascend much more.

00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:40.765
The seventh chakra is just the beginning.

00:53:41.547 --> 00:53:43.242
It's is just the beginning.

00:53:50.449 --> 00:53:53.527
Seeker: I have a couple of books, one by Yogananda

00:53:53.727 --> 00:53:55.360
and one by Sri Ramakrishna.

00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:57.386
I would like to know if was they,

00:53:57.586 --> 00:53:59.260
is they false prophets?

00:54:01.189 --> 00:54:03.255
Shri Mataji: I don’t want to talk about personal things.

00:54:03.455 --> 00:54:05.635
see because I don’t want to shock you about things,

00:54:05.835 --> 00:54:08.075
but you yourself will find out, all right.

00:54:08.275 --> 00:54:12.208
You get your enlightenment, yourself
you can find out what is false, what is real.

00:54:12.408 --> 00:54:15.505
If they’re real, then you’ll start
getting the cool breeze in the hands.

00:54:15.705 --> 00:54:16.965
If they are false,

00:54:17.184 --> 00:54:19.275
then you’ll get even blisters

00:54:20.494 --> 00:54:21.530
in the hand.

00:54:21.730 --> 00:54:24.815
So one has to understand what is real and unreal

00:54:25.015 --> 00:54:27.108
by one’s own understanding.

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:30.054
When you will discover it in no time.

00:54:30.350 --> 00:54:34.593
Hatha Yoga is just a wee bit of real Patanjali’s Hatha Yoga,

00:54:34.793 --> 00:54:37.152
and it’s absolutely wrong because

00:54:37.352 --> 00:54:38.993
it makes you very one sided.

00:54:39.193 --> 00:54:41.188
You become physically attentive,

00:54:41.388 --> 00:54:45.119
but you are not only a physical
being, you are a mental being, you are

00:54:45.792 --> 00:54:48.800
emotional being, you are also a spiritual being.

00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.891
So this is just such a wee bit.

00:54:51.091 --> 00:54:53.520
If you see the book of Patanjali’s it’s so great,

00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:56.751
and in that all Sahaja Yoga is written, Sahaja Yoga written.

00:54:56.951 --> 00:55:00.250
Why they have taken only the – just like jogging it is.

00:55:00.450 --> 00:55:02.982
Just another style of jogging.

00:55:05.656 --> 00:55:07.567
So should we have now the realization?

00:55:07.767 --> 00:55:10.775
There’s a lady there? Now, that’s the last, eh?

00:55:11.385 --> 00:55:13.946
Seeker: I was wondering after death,

00:55:14.146 --> 00:55:17.732
whats the quickest that soul turns to return to a body?

00:55:17.932 --> 00:55:19.390
How long?

00:55:19.590 --> 00:55:22.612
Warren: She answered the question about death by saying,

00:55:22.812 --> 00:55:25.695
“Put the attention to the future - to the present

00:55:25.895 --> 00:55:27.192
not to the future.”

00:55:27.392 --> 00:55:28.918
Shri Mataji: Just now is not important.

00:55:29.118 --> 00:55:31.392
I’ll tell you all about it, it's nothing -

00:55:33.392 --> 00:55:34.730
What she say?

00:55:34.930 --> 00:55:37.503
Seeker: I'm just wondering about that one?

00:55:37.909 --> 00:55:39.909
Warren: Whats the question again?

00:55:43.862 --> 00:55:45.233
Shri Mataji: Please stand up, please stand up.

00:55:45.511 --> 00:55:48.948
Question: After death how quickly does the soul reincarnate?

00:55:49.659 --> 00:55:51.260
Shri Mataji: I mean, you know this is a subject

00:55:51.460 --> 00:55:54.158
which has to be dealt for one year over at least, you see.

00:55:54.358 --> 00:55:55.862
And it's of no use to you,

00:55:56.062 --> 00:55:58.780
what is the use of asking a question like this.

00:55:59.818 --> 00:56:02.329
Warren: She asking on behalf of somebody else.

00:56:02.529 --> 00:56:04.148
Shri Mataji: But where is the friend?

00:56:04.411 --> 00:56:05.879
Warren: Is that person dead?

00:56:06.305 --> 00:56:08.666
Yes, that person who is dead already.

00:56:10.195 --> 00:56:13.503
I think you come and see me and I’ll tell you all about it, all right?

00:56:13.703 --> 00:56:16.539
Because just now, we don’t
want to spoil the minds of people,

00:56:16.739 --> 00:56:18.476
all right, with the death and all this nonsense.

00:56:18.676 --> 00:56:20.878
Just now, let us be in the present.

00:56:24.449 --> 00:56:25.904
Seeker: Can I ask one last question?

00:56:26.104 --> 00:56:28.104
Shri Mataji: Now, ask.

00:56:29.549 --> 00:56:33.212
Seeker: Beyond the crown chakra
is it still the Kundalini that’s at work?

00:56:33.412 --> 00:56:35.276
Or is it another power too?

00:56:42.404 --> 00:56:45.510
Shri Mataji: Well the Kundalini itself
because she is the primordial mother,

00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:47.291
shes the primordial,

00:56:47.653 --> 00:56:49.012
shes the primordial.

00:56:49.212 --> 00:56:51.024
You see, must understand shes the Adi Shakti,

00:56:51.224 --> 00:56:52.719
shes the primordial mother

00:56:52.919 --> 00:56:54.977
and she works throughout.

00:56:55.177 --> 00:56:57.565
She is the witness to the last (unclear)

00:56:57.936 --> 00:57:01.412
So she works throughout, I mean
there’s nobody else who works it out

00:57:01.612 --> 00:57:04.479
but because your enlighten you do much faster,

00:57:04.679 --> 00:57:06.156
your accelerated.

00:57:06.356 --> 00:57:08.012
At that point you are accelerated

00:57:08.212 --> 00:57:10.126
because of your enlightenment.

00:57:10.326 --> 00:57:13.068
That acceleration takes place much faster.

00:57:17.145 --> 00:57:19.350
To look at it, looks like Kundalini

00:57:19.550 --> 00:57:21.332
but it is complete Aum.

00:57:21.532 --> 00:57:25.508
It is a complete force, the reflection of the

00:57:27.461 --> 00:57:31.412
divine love of God which is the Power of God, complete.

00:57:31.612 --> 00:57:34.138
Because God Himself separates from His Power.

00:57:34.338 --> 00:57:35.846
And becomes the spectator

00:57:36.046 --> 00:57:38.764
and the Power of God divides itself into three.

00:57:38.964 --> 00:57:40.854
And becomes the creation

00:57:41.054 --> 00:57:42.892
and the whole thing is the Kundalini,

00:57:43.092 --> 00:57:45.443
is the Kundalini is as they call residual

00:57:45.643 --> 00:57:49.096
because she manifests all that but still shes complete.

00:57:49.439 --> 00:57:51.455
Shes complete and then she reflects this,

00:57:51.655 --> 00:57:54.068
so throughout she works it out.

00:57:57.307 --> 00:57:59.722
Of course in you is the reflection

00:57:59.922 --> 00:58:02.028
of that primordial Kundalini.

00:58:09.841 --> 00:58:11.200
It's a form

00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:13.524
of the primordial mother.

00:58:13.724 --> 00:58:15.788
she becomes that form.

00:58:18.177 --> 00:58:20.239
Say now I'm your teacher

00:58:20.439 --> 00:58:22.902
but also I am a wife, I'm grandma.

00:58:23.102 --> 00:58:25.908
In the same way she becomes

00:58:26.330 --> 00:58:27.862
the Kundalini.

01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:35.172
Tomorrow again we will meet here

01:33:35.372 --> 01:33:37.799
that's the last day I'll be with you,

01:33:37.999 --> 01:33:40.692
please try to telephone to your friends tomorrow

01:33:40.892 --> 01:33:43.716
and get their friends, as many as possible

01:33:43.916 --> 01:33:46.437
because I don't know when will I'll come back again.

01:33:46.637 --> 01:33:49.572
So try to get them, they should all get their realization

01:33:49.772 --> 01:33:52.732
and I hope day after tomorrow we might be able

01:33:52.932 --> 01:33:55.895
to at least a

01:33:56.095 --> 01:33:58.428
workshop and show how

01:33:59.053 --> 01:34:01.508
to make you understand

01:34:03.940 --> 01:34:06.859
the Sahaja Yoga, how to work it out and everything.

01:34:07.059 --> 01:34:10.317
Hope to again on Friday.

01:34:10.996 --> 01:34:14.172
So tomorrow please start to call your friends,

01:34:14.372 --> 01:34:16.756
it is their right to have to have it, they should be here.

01:34:16.956 --> 01:34:18.892
If they had come, they would have got it

01:34:19.092 --> 01:34:20.398
and then the growth will start.

01:34:20.598 --> 01:34:23.532
Now go home, don't talk to anyone,

01:34:23.732 --> 01:34:26.216
do not argue, this cannot be argued

01:34:26.416 --> 01:34:29.417
some people haven't got it, supposedly they start arguing.

01:34:29.617 --> 01:34:32.320
Do not argue it out, just go home,

01:34:32.520 --> 01:34:33.865
have your food and sleep on,

01:34:34.065 --> 01:34:36.303
enjoy, you feel very much better tomorrow.

01:34:36.503 --> 01:34:39.002
I'm back here and I'll be able to explain to you

01:34:39.202 --> 01:34:42.052
some others things about chakras and things.

01:34:42.252 --> 01:34:44.512
And if you have any questions, I'd ask you.

01:34:44.712 --> 01:34:46.212
May God bless you.
