1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,690
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

2
00:00:12,651 --> 00:00:15,106
At the very outset,

3
00:00:15,134 --> 00:00:20,515
I have to tell you that Truth is what it is.

4
00:00:20,553 --> 00:00:23,001
You cannot change it,

5
00:00:23,042 --> 00:00:25,977
you cannot transform it,

6
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,507
you cannot explain it.

7
00:00:28,532 --> 00:00:31,882
Only thing you can experience it.

8
00:00:34,837 --> 00:00:36,944
In this Kali Yuga

9
00:00:37,094 --> 00:00:41,235
there is a special category of people born

10
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:44,265
in all the countries very surprisingly,

11
00:00:44,304 --> 00:00:48,030
who are seekers of Truth.

12
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:55,006
And William Blake, the great poet of England

13
00:00:55,076 --> 00:00:57,326
has said that

14
00:00:58,665 --> 00:01:03,479
these men of God will be born during this time

15
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:06,739
and they will know the truth

16
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:09,010
So many have said about this.

17
00:01:09,037 --> 00:01:14,197
Even in our old books of prophecies.

18
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:19,186
You have known so many of them

19
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:23,034
but especially the one which is described

20
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:26,599
in Nadi Granth written by Bhrigu Muni

21
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,569
is clearly said that at this time

22
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:34,474
people will know the Truth through the Kundalini Awakening.

23
00:01:34,495 --> 00:01:37,475
The knowledge of Kundalini was known to us,

24
00:01:37,525 --> 00:01:41,006
I don’t know how many years back.

25
00:01:41,096 --> 00:01:45,739
You cannot say because our history is so unknown.

26
00:01:45,795 --> 00:01:51,530
But at the time of a great saint

27
00:01:51,543 --> 00:01:54,981
called as Macchindra Nath and Gorakh Nath,

28
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,292
they were indulging into

29
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:02,408
awakening of Kundalini

30
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:07,832
but the condition was that one Guru should give Realisation to only one person.

31
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:09,953
Went on like this

32
00:02:09,962 --> 00:02:12,342
till the twelfth century when

33
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,943
Gyandeva first of all asked his Guru,

34
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:18,272
his own Master was his own brother.

35
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,312
asked him that,

36
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,461
“You please allow me to at least write about Kundalini.”

37
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,548
Because in the Gita it was not described.

38
00:02:29,574 --> 00:02:33,138
Though Shri Krishna has talked of Sthit Pragnya and all those things

39
00:02:33,163 --> 00:02:36,704
but he didn’t talk about:

40
00:02:36,717 --> 00:02:37,723
How to get it?

41
00:02:37,752 --> 00:02:42,021
What is the mechanism within us which works it out?

42
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:46,812
Then he wrote it in his Gyaneshwari

43
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,610
which is just a, I think,

44
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:52,389
explanation of Gita very clearly

45
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,893
that there is a power within us.

46
00:02:54,894 --> 00:02:57,763
In the sixth chapter he wrote about Kundalini

47
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:01,902
but the people who were in charge of religion didn’t want that.

48
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:04,587
So they said, “This is a Nishiddha (prohibited) part

49
00:03:04,647 --> 00:03:07,949
and you should not read this part of Kundalini.”

50
00:03:07,957 --> 00:03:10,218
But in the sixteenth century

51
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:13,045
under the guidance of Guru Nanaka,

52
00:03:13,086 --> 00:03:14,086
Namdeva,

53
00:03:14,116 --> 00:03:15,479
Kabira,

54
00:03:15,496 --> 00:03:21,981
all these people, clearly, clearly, very clearly wrote about Kundalini

55
00:03:22,027 --> 00:03:26,281
but the way it was mutilated

56
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:29,344
by

57
00:03:29,365 --> 00:03:31,907
people which is very surprising.

58
00:03:31,925 --> 00:03:33,737
Everything has been mutilated

59
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:36,481
but this one was very surprising

60
00:03:36,512 --> 00:03:40,411
because Kabira was in Bihar

61
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,711
and he called Kundalini as Surti.

62
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:45,311
Very clearly, he said about Surti

63
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:51,260
but in Bihar, ‘Surti’ is what you call ‘tobacco’.

64
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:53,040
They call ‘tobacco’ as ‘Surti’,

65
00:03:53,043 --> 00:03:56,116
so you can imagine what is the mutilation.

66
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:59,313
Now this power is within you.

67
00:03:59,362 --> 00:04:01,213
If I am telling you something today

68
00:04:01,234 --> 00:04:03,014
you need not accept it.

69
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:05,633
Blind folded acceptance is of no use.

70
00:04:05,663 --> 00:04:09,060
We have had enough problems with blind faiths.

71
00:04:09,074 --> 00:04:11,026
So, first of all

72
00:04:11,027 --> 00:04:12,596
you must get the experience

73
00:04:12,608 --> 00:04:16,430
and then you will not doubt it.

74
00:04:16,427 --> 00:04:20,274
This science was known to us since long

75
00:04:20,314 --> 00:04:22,634
but as it was only done for one person

76
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:25,884
or say ten persons at the most,

77
00:04:25,894 --> 00:04:28,744
I decided to find out a method by which

78
00:04:28,774 --> 00:04:32,644
an en-masse Realisation could be given.

79
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:35,536
Luckily my father was a very social person

80
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:38,235
and I could meet many people.

81
00:04:38,286 --> 00:04:42,579
Even my husband’s life was such that I could meet many people.

82
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:49,230
So, I worked out the permutations and combinations of human problems

83
00:04:49,281 --> 00:04:51,095
and then I discovered

84
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:53,814
how we can easily solve this problem

85
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:55,954
of Kundalini awakening.

86
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,324
Because there are problems

87
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:00,475
on the way of its ascent

88
00:05:00,517 --> 00:05:04,197
then Kundalini doesn’t, Kundalini doesn’t come up.

89
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,766
Now

90
00:05:05,815 --> 00:05:08,255
there are seven chakras

91
00:05:08,317 --> 00:05:11,125
basically within us.

92
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:14,252
These seven chakras are responsible

93
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:18,910
of our physical, mental and emotional being.

94
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:20,610
There is no doubt about it

95
00:05:20,624 --> 00:05:22,954
but you have to first find out

96
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:24,040
and then believe in it.

97
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,240
Don’t believe because I am saying so

98
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:30,543
or anybody says so. You have to experience it and feel it.

99
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,853
There are many ways we can also judge.

100
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:35,353
For example,

101
00:05:35,374 --> 00:05:36,903
in the Koran,

102
00:05:36,913 --> 00:05:41,853
Mohammed Sahib has said, “At the time of Kayama, means this time of Resurrection,

103
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:43,754
your hands will speak.”

104
00:05:43,793 --> 00:05:45,713
He also calls it ‘Kayamat’

105
00:05:45,757 --> 00:05:48,767
means ‘those who will not accept will suffer’.

106
00:05:48,788 --> 00:05:51,208
But who will accept their hands will speak,

107
00:05:51,228 --> 00:05:52,499
their

108
00:05:52,559 --> 00:05:55,199
mouth will be shut and their hands will speak?

109
00:05:55,269 --> 00:05:57,459
This is exactly what happens in Sahaja Yoga

110
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:00,497
that once you get your Self-realisation

111
00:06:00,543 --> 00:06:03,947
you can feel those subtle centres within you.

112
00:06:03,983 --> 00:06:06,100
These subtle centres of energy

113
00:06:06,129 --> 00:06:07,819
are seven in number

114
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:15,754
and are acting for giving us all kinds of energies.

115
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:18,670
Now the problem is how to make

116
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:20,540
people believe in Kundalini.

117
00:06:20,553 --> 00:06:22,440
It’s a difficult task

118
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:24,331
because you are all intellectuals

119
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:28,071
and you have had your medical education

120
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,983
from England and all these places you see.

121
00:06:30,992 --> 00:06:32,713
It is more westernised

122
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:34,988
and to believe in something Indian

123
00:06:35,026 --> 00:06:38,829
is rather difficult for people that it’s all Indian after all.

124
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:41,976
But actually, even in medical science

125
00:06:42,047 --> 00:06:45,177
we have to understand the limitations of a science.

126
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:48,187
First of all, science is amoral.

127
00:06:50,596 --> 00:06:53,838
Secondly, it does not go to the roots.

128
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:58,208
So, it starts like we have to treat a tree.

129
00:06:58,213 --> 00:06:59,858
So, we treat the leaves,

130
00:06:59,874 --> 00:07:01,269
treat the branches

131
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:03,608
but Sahaja Yoga is going to the roots,

132
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:05,326
is the knowledge of the roots.

133
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:09,230
And the roots are the seven chakras and our Kundalini.

134
00:07:09,279 --> 00:07:12,651
Of course, without medical science you cannot also understand Sahaja Yoga.

135
00:07:12,672 --> 00:07:18,805
That is also one of the things because you can relate very easily. It is very scientific.

136
00:07:18,821 --> 00:07:21,581
Now there are three Nadis also

137
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:24,310
Left, Right and Centre.

138
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:27,139
Left is called as Ida Nadi,

139
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,939
right as Pingala

140
00:07:29,019 --> 00:07:36,050
and the central one is called as Sushumna Nadi.

141
00:07:38,982 --> 00:07:41,572
Kabira has described it very clearly

142
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:44,518
and it is in the Granth Sahib

143
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:48,088
written down but nobody tries to understand

144
00:07:48,129 --> 00:07:49,648
or to go beyond the words.

145
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,818
Just go and read the words that is not going to help.

146
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,248
You have to go beyond it.

147
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:59,348
It is like this, you see a beautiful picture say where it’s raining,

148
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:04,008
it’s very beautiful and you are seeing it, that’s all.

149
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:07,514
But you are not inside it to experience it.

150
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:10,134
So, to enter inside was difficult one

151
00:08:10,204 --> 00:08:13,716
because of the tradition of giving to one person only,

152
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:15,194
or to few persons

153
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,266
and secondly the greatest objection

154
00:08:17,276 --> 00:08:21,026
came from people, who were in charge of religion

155
00:08:21,045 --> 00:08:22,545
so called

156
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,560
Nowadays those who are intellectuals,

157
00:08:24,581 --> 00:08:30,802
you should say medias and other people

158
00:08:30,831 --> 00:08:33,939
who have a feeling that they know everything,

159
00:08:33,948 --> 00:08:37,605
they don’t want to take anything, that is to begin with.

160
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:39,706
This is one of the reasons why

161
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:44,864
people don’t turn their eyes to the great knowledge we have in this country

162
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:49,134
I am so very happy today that

163
00:08:49,152 --> 00:08:51,804
Indian Medical Association

164
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:54,438
has given me this honour first of all

165
00:08:54,471 --> 00:08:57,783
because I could never imagine in my lifetime,

166
00:08:57,801 --> 00:08:59,858
I would be able to talk with you.

167
00:08:59,888 --> 00:09:04,342
I also did my medicine and I knew how difficult it was

168
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,326
and how people were blind.

169
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:09,722
So, I used to think, “How will I explain to them”,

170
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:11,047
like Kabira has said,

171
00:09:11,046 --> 00:09:16,287
“Kaise samjhau, sab jag andha” (How to make them understand when the whole world is blind?)

172
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,947
But the time has come because there are seekers now.

173
00:09:18,971 --> 00:09:21,116
And they should also know one more thing,

174
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:23,557
that this country is the Yogabhoomi.

175
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:25,596
They have given us science all right

176
00:09:25,633 --> 00:09:27,003
but we will give them Yoga.

177
00:09:27,052 --> 00:09:33,028
We will give them the real basic knowledge

178
00:09:33,058 --> 00:09:38,127
what is the foundation of Medical Science,

179
00:09:38,134 --> 00:09:40,154
is the foundation!

180
00:09:40,174 --> 00:09:44,354
Now by experimenting this and that

181
00:09:44,354 --> 00:09:47,831
also you have seen that it is neutralised by challenges.

182
00:09:47,846 --> 00:09:49,874
Every theory is neutralised

183
00:09:49,884 --> 00:09:52,519
so that means it is not Absolute.

184
00:09:52,546 --> 00:09:56,558
So, we have to go to something that is absolutely Absolute

185
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,556
You have seen that Einstein found out something

186
00:09:59,605 --> 00:10:01,359
then our people are after him

187
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:04,378
this is wrong, that is wrong, going on like that.

188
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:07,848
All the time something comes up, people go on criticising

189
00:10:07,855 --> 00:10:12,460
and the whole knowledge goes into oblivion.

190
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:16,481
So now we have to understand that if this is the Yogabhoomi,

191
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,361
this is our country

192
00:10:18,381 --> 00:10:21,163
and if it has given us such a knowledge,

193
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,461
why should we not also listen to it,

194
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,966
because not only that it will flower your knowledge of medicine,

195
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:36,731
not only that but it will give you such a confidence while practicing,

196
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,507
while talking about medicine.

197
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:42,717
Now as it is a subject,

198
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:44,327
is on medicine

199
00:10:44,347 --> 00:10:47,341
I would like to speak on one of the centres

200
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:52,018
which is very important because doctors are always affected by that centre.

201
00:10:52,034 --> 00:10:56,068
So, I better tell them what can go wrong with doctors

202
00:10:56,094 --> 00:10:58,394
and what they should be careful about.

203
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:10,239
It is to be understood that there is a centre,

204
00:11:10,288 --> 00:11:14,799
is the second centre which we call as Swadishthan.

205
00:11:14,813 --> 00:11:16,739
This centre is very interesting.

206
00:11:16,774 --> 00:11:20,659
It comes out of the Solar Plexus

207
00:11:20,693 --> 00:11:24,750
we call it a Nabhi Chakra

208
00:11:24,764 --> 00:11:28,140
and like a lotus and it moves all round you see,

209
00:11:28,153 --> 00:11:32,020
as you can say in gross way it is Aortic Plexus.

210
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:34,222
It supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

211
00:11:34,254 --> 00:11:38,710
It is not Aortic Plexus but supplies energy to Aortic Plexus.

212
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:43,461
Now this centre is very important

213
00:11:43,501 --> 00:11:46,322
because it gives energy to our liver,

214
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:49,313
to pancreas,

215
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,883
to our spleen, to our intestines,

216
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:54,043
to our kidneys,

217
00:11:54,048 --> 00:11:57,158
can you imagine such an important centre it is!

218
00:11:57,145 --> 00:11:58,346
This Swadishthan!

219
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,456
But the most important work it does is very...

220
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,806
which I don’t know you will accept or not

221
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:07,880
but it supplies energy to our grey cells

222
00:12:07,895 --> 00:12:11,150
which we are using all the time.

223
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,118
When we are thinking too much,

224
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:16,588
when we are acting physically and mentally,

225
00:12:16,615 --> 00:12:21,762
this centre has to supply energy to our brain,

226
00:12:21,755 --> 00:12:25,312
we can call it to our grey cells

227
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:28,972
which we are using all the time.

228
00:12:29,005 --> 00:12:30,312
When we are doctors,

229
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:32,620
we are using our grey cells how much?

230
00:12:32,633 --> 00:12:33,353
We have no idea.

231
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,076
There is nobody who has found out

232
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:37,879
how much we use our brains,

233
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:42,912
but we are going exhausting our brains and also, we are very futuristic.

234
00:12:42,914 --> 00:12:45,082
All doctors are futuristic.

235
00:12:45,105 --> 00:12:49,826
Maybe they want to find out something

236
00:12:49,886 --> 00:12:51,947
in the pure sense of the word

237
00:12:51,964 --> 00:12:54,557
or maybe they have certain ideas

238
00:12:54,578 --> 00:12:56,364
or maybe it is money,

239
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,384
may be anything but they are very, very futuristic

240
00:12:59,395 --> 00:13:03,057
and in that trend of futuristic behaviour also

241
00:13:03,086 --> 00:13:04,922
there is a big competition

242
00:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,642
so they don’t know what to do.

243
00:13:06,668 --> 00:13:10,212
They have to be futuristic and think but what will happen.

244
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:17,691
Now in this kind of movement of the mind

245
00:13:17,706 --> 00:13:18,504
what happens

246
00:13:18,534 --> 00:13:21,093
we start becoming very right sided,

247
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:22,683
extremely right sided.

248
00:13:22,711 --> 00:13:24,483
Now as a result of that,

249
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:26,739
as a right sided man, you know

250
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:29,028
I would say what medically can happen,

251
00:13:29,048 --> 00:13:32,753
of course also happens lot of things mentally also.

252
00:13:32,768 --> 00:13:37,399
But what can happen medically,

253
00:13:37,408 --> 00:13:39,369
this Swadishthan Chakra

254
00:13:39,418 --> 00:13:41,458
which has to supply to your liver.

255
00:13:41,469 --> 00:13:43,168
Why do you call it ‘liver’?

256
00:13:43,188 --> 00:13:44,999
Because of liver we live.

257
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:49,120
Liver is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

258
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:52,360
I know that in medicine we don’t know much about liver

259
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:56,919
and it is absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga.

260
00:13:56,926 --> 00:13:58,360
But now what happens,

261
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:03,828
liver is the one which takes all the poison of the body

262
00:14:03,846 --> 00:14:08,385
and throws it into the circulation.

263
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,938
That everyone knows, all right!

264
00:14:10,946 --> 00:14:15,466
Now when liver is looked after it is normal,

265
00:14:15,475 --> 00:14:17,645
then we have also a pancreas,

266
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:20,306
then we have spleen

267
00:14:20,355 --> 00:14:22,375
and also kidneys

268
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,586
and the last part of intestines,

269
00:14:25,635 --> 00:14:28,951
intestines as a whole but the last part is very important.

270
00:14:28,972 --> 00:14:31,732
So, such a man who is always thinking

271
00:14:31,783 --> 00:14:35,011
all his energy is going to his brain

272
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:37,403
and all these organs are neglected

273
00:14:37,472 --> 00:14:40,857
and he can be affected by any one of them

274
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,717
So, the first thing he is affected is bad liver.

275
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,523
Now this bad liver

276
00:14:46,538 --> 00:14:50,692
because it cannot throw its heat,

277
00:14:50,717 --> 00:14:52,741
which is the poison of the body

278
00:14:52,751 --> 00:14:54,052
into the circulation.

279
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,251
What happens that it starts, heat starts rising,

280
00:14:57,282 --> 00:15:00,782
this heat goes higher on the right side.

281
00:15:00,841 --> 00:15:02,512
We call it Right Heart

282
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:05,972
which is the centre which controls the lungs.

283
00:15:05,952 --> 00:15:08,912
So, such a person can get Asthma.

284
00:15:08,929 --> 00:15:11,622
Now Asthma has been cured through Sahaja Yoga,

285
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:13,212
very simple way.

286
00:15:13,283 --> 00:15:14,819
But it can be cured,

287
00:15:14,832 --> 00:15:20,409
it gets Asthma. We say it is incurable because we don't know about Swadishthan.

288
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:24,179
Now this same thing happens to our…

289
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:27,211
when it moves to the left side pancreas.

290
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:29,641
Mostly people who are sitting on their chairs

291
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,198
and thinking too much and planning too much

292
00:15:32,206 --> 00:15:33,678
get diabetes.

293
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:41,139
Sugar doesn’t give you diabetes.

294
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:44,844
In Maharashtra, I don’t know maybe here also in the villages,

295
00:15:44,864 --> 00:15:48,429
a villager will take sugar

296
00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:51,699
in such a way that the spoon must stand at the right angles

297
00:15:51,724 --> 00:15:54,139
That’s the way

298
00:15:54,169 --> 00:15:56,503
a tea has to be made otherwise it is not tea,

299
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:58,063
but he never gets diabetes,

300
00:15:58,038 --> 00:16:03,652
because he earns without any insurance or anything, spends it sleeps off.

301
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:05,032
Next day he earns.

302
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:07,211
He does not have botheration about future.

303
00:16:07,235 --> 00:16:08,335
What he should do?

304
00:16:08,394 --> 00:16:09,840
He should accumulate money

305
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:12,611
or he should give it to somebody? Nothing.

306
00:16:12,611 --> 00:16:15,566
He just lives with himself.

307
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:18,846
Now this goes to pancreas,

308
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:20,456
gives you diabetes,

309
00:16:20,466 --> 00:16:21,285
this heat

310
00:16:21,326 --> 00:16:23,147
Then it goes down

311
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:26,807
then the kidney, kidney it coagulates.

312
00:16:26,817 --> 00:16:29,027
Now for kidney if you go to dialysis,

313
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,147
I must tell you

314
00:16:30,157 --> 00:16:31,465
not that only you die

315
00:16:31,476 --> 00:16:35,777
but you die bankrupt it is a fact.

316
00:16:35,797 --> 00:16:39,812
Now in no way I want to criticise doctors,

317
00:16:39,863 --> 00:16:41,783
they have to earn after all,

318
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,613
but there is a simple way

319
00:16:43,633 --> 00:16:46,413
of curing this kidney trouble

320
00:16:46,393 --> 00:16:48,293
And once this kidney is cured,

321
00:16:48,283 --> 00:16:50,758
it is cured forever

322
00:16:50,765 --> 00:16:53,479
So, by helping Swadishthan

323
00:16:53,485 --> 00:16:56,895
you can cure also kidney.

324
00:16:56,895 --> 00:16:59,109
But the most difficult thing

325
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,696
is the spleen.

326
00:17:00,735 --> 00:17:04,196
Now in modern times

327
00:17:04,237 --> 00:17:06,053
we are very hectic

328
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:06,863
For example,

329
00:17:06,886 --> 00:17:10,212
most of the doctors have to get up early in the morning

330
00:17:10,232 --> 00:17:11,732
on duty.

331
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:14,604
In college we also used to do the same thing.

332
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:15,624
Then we have no time

333
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:17,770
to eat our food properly nothing.

334
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:20,203
And we take our breakfast with us sometimes.

335
00:17:20,237 --> 00:17:21,115
In America

336
00:17:21,134 --> 00:17:23,535
I have seen doctors even brushing their teeth

337
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:25,831
in the car.

338
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:27,644
It is the limit of things.

339
00:17:27,644 --> 00:17:30,943
So, in this kind of a hectic life

340
00:17:31,003 --> 00:17:32,163
what happens:

341
00:17:32,183 --> 00:17:33,273
the spleen, poor thing

342
00:17:33,314 --> 00:17:36,894
which has to produce RBCs for emergencies

343
00:17:36,913 --> 00:17:38,031
gets mad.

344
00:17:38,053 --> 00:17:39,903
She can’t understand,

345
00:17:39,902 --> 00:17:42,112
“What is the matter with this gentleman?”

346
00:17:42,162 --> 00:17:47,580
and it cannot also a sort of cooperate

347
00:17:47,624 --> 00:17:49,773
with all the madness we have.

348
00:17:49,804 --> 00:17:51,288
Then we read newspapers.

349
00:17:51,304 --> 00:17:53,617
Reading newspapers in the morning

350
00:17:53,644 --> 00:17:55,387
is a very dangerous thing

351
00:17:55,413 --> 00:17:57,835
because every day you see something horrible

352
00:17:57,859 --> 00:17:59,305
and you get such a fright.

353
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:02,256
For example, these days our country is in doldrums.

354
00:18:02,296 --> 00:18:03,500
I never read it in the morning

355
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:04,816
at any cost

356
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:07,289
But if you read it early in the morning any newspaper

357
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,333
then finished, you will get some…

358
00:18:09,355 --> 00:18:13,036
They only tell you about what has gone wrong;

359
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:15,306
disasters, accidents,

360
00:18:15,365 --> 00:18:17,810
if not that then political crisis,

361
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:20,559
this that which upsets you.

362
00:18:20,596 --> 00:18:22,450
Whether you like it or not

363
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:24,420
but it upsets you.

364
00:18:24,445 --> 00:18:27,859
So, reading newspaper early in the morning,

365
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:32,392
then just running forward.

366
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:33,642
No time for wife,

367
00:18:33,711 --> 00:18:35,862
no time for children, nothing.

368
00:18:35,902 --> 00:18:39,792
Formerly I remember that husband used to eat nicely

369
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,053
at about ten o’clock.

370
00:18:41,056 --> 00:18:42,875
The wife used to fan him

371
00:18:42,945 --> 00:18:47,536
because there might be some flies around.

372
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:49,817
She used to fan

373
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:55,577
and relaxed way they used to eat food and live relaxed.

374
00:18:55,597 --> 00:18:58,968
Now what you call in Urdu language

375
00:18:58,988 --> 00:19:01,488
‘Kashmakash’ (Mental Struggle) is so much,

376
00:19:01,498 --> 00:19:03,678
that people are just running mad.

377
00:19:03,755 --> 00:19:05,384
They don’t know what to do.

378
00:19:05,454 --> 00:19:06,615
Now they go to the office,

379
00:19:06,615 --> 00:19:08,704
then they find, doctors especially,

380
00:19:08,704 --> 00:19:10,259
the boss is angry

381
00:19:10,309 --> 00:19:12,923
or there is some very serious patient has come,

382
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:15,039
somebody has died by mistake.

383
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:19,089
I mean doctors are completely treated

384
00:19:19,109 --> 00:19:20,700
like criminals in America,

385
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,539
absolutely like criminals.

386
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,680
So, this is also coming here.

387
00:19:24,693 --> 00:19:26,513
If they do anything wrong by mistake,

388
00:19:26,574 --> 00:19:29,574
they do something, finished.

389
00:19:29,604 --> 00:19:30,909
Their practice is gone,

390
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,189
they are put in jail.

391
00:19:33,203 --> 00:19:35,951
I mean after all they're human beings

392
00:19:35,971 --> 00:19:38,182
but this consideration is not there

393
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:43,321
And so, this futuristic life makes them really crazy people.

394
00:19:43,372 --> 00:19:44,922
Then they become very hot tempered.

395
00:19:44,932 --> 00:19:45,957
Liver gives you heat,

396
00:19:45,982 --> 00:19:48,762
you become very hot tempered at the slightest thing,

397
00:19:48,792 --> 00:19:50,137
you just shoot off

398
00:19:50,153 --> 00:19:52,971
and start saying things which you should never have said.

399
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,571
Then you feel guilty.

400
00:19:54,587 --> 00:19:57,958
When you feel guilty you catch this centre here,

401
00:19:57,968 --> 00:19:59,347
left Vishuddhi we call it

402
00:19:59,397 --> 00:20:01,758
by which you develop spondylitis.

403
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:03,244
If not spondylitis,

404
00:20:03,278 --> 00:20:06,184
there is something horrible thing can happen to you.

405
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,505
Now according to Sahaja Yoga,

406
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:10,755
we have two types of heart attacks.

407
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:13,801
One is an active massive heart attack

408
00:20:13,839 --> 00:20:17,553
and another one is what you call lethargic

409
00:20:17,586 --> 00:20:19,386
like angina.

410
00:20:19,403 --> 00:20:23,977
So, the first one which happens

411
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,517
is the massive one

412
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:29,068
where same thing the heat reaches the heart.

413
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:30,588
Now say there is a boy

414
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:32,538
who is playing tennis

415
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:34,558
at the age of twenty-one or twenty-two

416
00:20:34,597 --> 00:20:37,941
and is drinking also, competing with his father.

417
00:20:37,978 --> 00:20:41,281
So, he gets that massive heart attack

418
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,471
and it is absolutely fatal.

419
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:45,922
He cannot live after that.

420
00:20:45,981 --> 00:20:48,718
This is a very common case you must have also seen.

421
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,674
I am not telling you something out of the blue.

422
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:53,894
But the another one is

423
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,826
if you continue with this kind of thing

424
00:20:56,837 --> 00:21:01,295
then maybe one day you might get massive heart attacks

425
00:21:01,326 --> 00:21:03,105
especially the industrialists.

426
00:21:03,146 --> 00:21:06,065
Industrialists are so much futuristic,

427
00:21:06,076 --> 00:21:07,557
so much calculating

428
00:21:07,606 --> 00:21:13,986
that they don’t calculate that this will entail

429
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,471
their own heart trouble

430
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,439
So, this heart suddenly collapses and they die.

431
00:21:20,441 --> 00:21:24,298
This is a, we call it an active heart attack

432
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:26,002
due to over acting.

433
00:21:26,073 --> 00:21:28,212
Another one is lethargic heart attack

434
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:29,482
like angina,

435
00:21:29,553 --> 00:21:33,682
that is if this centre is caught here, if you feel guilty.

436
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:37,413
Some people are very sensitive and very formal type

437
00:21:37,472 --> 00:21:38,785
you know, they feel guilty,

438
00:21:38,803 --> 00:21:40,385
“I should have done this.”

439
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:41,545
I have known people

440
00:21:41,563 --> 00:21:43,063
who have been crying all their life,

441
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:46,290
“I spilled coffee on the table of such and such.”

442
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:49,115
I say, “Let it be, now gone finished. Why are you bothered?”

443
00:21:49,111 --> 00:21:50,645
But they’ll go on and on and on.

444
00:21:50,641 --> 00:21:52,941
It’s a habit they have formed

445
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,911
to feel guilty about this.

446
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:57,591
So, about anything they start feeling guilty.

447
00:21:57,611 --> 00:22:01,733
In India we are not so much I think formal type

448
00:22:01,824 --> 00:22:03,171
of people, thank God.

449
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:05,374
So, I find less cases of this

450
00:22:05,423 --> 00:22:09,391
but still there are many people who develop this left side.

451
00:22:09,421 --> 00:22:13,539
Not only with that you develop your spondylitis,

452
00:22:13,568 --> 00:22:17,869
but you develop a situation

453
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:22,731
where heart cannot pump blood for your brain,

454
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:25,463
that is angina.

455
00:22:25,501 --> 00:22:29,031
Nobody knows that it comes from this left side problem;

456
00:22:29,031 --> 00:22:31,672
Left side problems come from other things also,

457
00:22:31,711 --> 00:22:35,183
but one of them is feeling guilty.

458
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,145
This is something I am telling you which

459
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,244
is not yet told in medical science.

460
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:43,296
But I am sure one day we will have it from India.

461
00:22:43,323 --> 00:22:44,483
We will tell these people

462
00:22:44,534 --> 00:22:49,273
what we know about the roots of trouble.

463
00:22:49,294 --> 00:22:51,778
The root of trouble is like that.

464
00:22:51,794 --> 00:22:54,877
So now the last but not the least

465
00:22:54,903 --> 00:22:57,288
is the effect of Swadishthan

466
00:22:57,304 --> 00:23:00,084
is this heat reaches the brain

467
00:23:00,134 --> 00:23:02,884
and gives you paralysis on the left hand side

468
00:23:02,884 --> 00:23:05,544
because you know it crosses over nerves.

469
00:23:05,574 --> 00:23:08,374
So, it gives you a terrible paralysis

470
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:11,153
on the left-hand side but you feel it on the right-hand side.

471
00:23:11,163 --> 00:23:14,903
Also, nature is the one which tries to stop it.

472
00:23:14,923 --> 00:23:17,963
If you don’t stop, it says, “All right, I will stop your right side.”

473
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,823
Left side will be all right.

474
00:23:20,829 --> 00:23:25,334
Now the one side of life is also right side.

475
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:29,317
Second side, another side we can say

476
00:23:29,294 --> 00:23:31,203
is the side which is left side.

477
00:23:31,263 --> 00:23:33,523
And the left side and right side when they meet,

478
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:36,513
you get psychosomatic trouble.

479
00:23:36,523 --> 00:23:39,394
With this Kundalini rising what happens

480
00:23:39,384 --> 00:23:42,013
that it nourishes those centres.

481
00:23:42,034 --> 00:23:44,503
For example, see this is one centre formed

482
00:23:44,544 --> 00:23:46,183
by two left and right side.

483
00:23:46,183 --> 00:23:49,027
This is a centre; left and right side.

484
00:23:49,035 --> 00:23:51,596
Now the Kundalini passes through this.

485
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:54,866
But supposing you are using right side too much like this

486
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:56,926
and suddenly left side breaks sometimes

487
00:23:56,934 --> 00:23:58,733
then what happens

488
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:04,922
that your connection with the main,

489
00:24:04,951 --> 00:24:07,038
you should say

490
00:24:07,061 --> 00:24:08,628
mains is lost.

491
00:24:08,662 --> 00:24:12,509
You are on your own and cancer starts.

492
00:24:12,531 --> 00:24:14,739
Now this cancer can be cured also;

493
00:24:14,761 --> 00:24:16,902
I am sorry to say but it is a fact.

494
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:17,927
It can be cured.

495
00:24:17,942 --> 00:24:20,847
Cancer can be cured,

496
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:24,530
not at a galloping stage I think but at an early stage.

497
00:24:24,549 --> 00:24:28,603
We have also tried some galloping stage people.

498
00:24:28,623 --> 00:24:29,863
They have improved

499
00:24:29,883 --> 00:24:33,044
but still I would say it is not guaranteed at that stage.

500
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:35,429
After all nothing is guaranteed

501
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:39,090
but still it works and it has worked.

502
00:24:39,128 --> 00:24:42,923
Now when this cancer is caused

503
00:24:42,943 --> 00:24:44,753
you see, what is our job

504
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:47,193
is to push back this left side with the right

505
00:24:47,191 --> 00:24:50,576
and also through Kundalini awakening to nourish,

506
00:24:50,596 --> 00:24:51,796
nourish the centre

507
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:55,335
You see this is the basis for our health

508
00:24:55,345 --> 00:24:59,935
our... you can say... mind,

509
00:24:59,986 --> 00:25:03,461
everything it’s a mental, physical and emotional

510
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:05,382
but also spiritual

511
00:25:05,442 --> 00:25:08,505
because when Kundalini rises like this;

512
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:13,659
it goes crosses over this fontanelle bone area.

513
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,328
This is Kabira has said,

514
00:25:16,388 --> 00:25:18,538
“Shunya shikhar par anahat baje re.”

515
00:25:18,619 --> 00:25:21,790
Nobody can explain what does he say.

516
00:25:21,808 --> 00:25:23,391
“Shunya shikhar par anahat,”

517
00:25:23,413 --> 00:25:24,270
is the heartbeat.

518
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:29,153
How can a heartbeat come up? ‘Shunya shikhar’ means ‘on the fontanelle bone area’

519
00:25:29,223 --> 00:25:30,243
He was not mad

520
00:25:30,292 --> 00:25:33,563
but the people who do not understand

521
00:25:33,633 --> 00:25:38,313
cannot think that this Kundalini reaches here. It does.

522
00:25:38,343 --> 00:25:39,863
You can see for yourself;

523
00:25:39,893 --> 00:25:41,413
it does reach here

524
00:25:41,462 --> 00:25:45,960
and once it breaks, this sound is finished

525
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:47,260
Then on your nerves,

526
00:25:47,290 --> 00:25:50,056
you are amazed on your central nervous system

527
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:52,435
you start feeling the cool breeze

528
00:25:52,496 --> 00:25:55,961
of the Holy Ghost as they call it in the Bible

529
00:25:55,996 --> 00:26:00,057
or they call it as the Alakh Niranjan

530
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:02,371
or they call it as Brahma Chaitanya.

531
00:26:02,386 --> 00:26:05,287
You start feeling it on your fingertips,

532
00:26:05,307 --> 00:26:07,471
on your hands, you can.

533
00:26:07,497 --> 00:26:11,780
If you experience that, still you go on saying, “No, no, no. I do not believe in anything.”

534
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,911
It’s all right.

535
00:26:12,971 --> 00:26:15,681
But if you really start moving into that line

536
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:17,942
and start feeling that,

537
00:26:17,961 --> 00:26:19,712
then you are amazed

538
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:23,603
because when the Kundalini rises as I told you,

539
00:26:23,632 --> 00:26:25,041
She helps you physically.

540
00:26:25,051 --> 00:26:28,493
I have told you about only one chakra but there are seven chakras.

541
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:30,323
So, all these seven chakras,

542
00:26:30,373 --> 00:26:34,473
they give permutation, combination of these three channels.

543
00:26:34,482 --> 00:26:36,094
It cures all.

544
00:26:36,093 --> 00:26:42,486
As a result, you start enjoying your life.

545
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:43,101
You become

546
00:26:43,115 --> 00:26:46,661
what you call a person who is a witness to this whole thing.

547
00:26:46,701 --> 00:26:48,770
The whole thing becomes just a drama

548
00:26:48,790 --> 00:26:50,942
and you start living,

549
00:26:50,961 --> 00:26:53,332
seeing it so clearly.

550
00:26:53,332 --> 00:26:55,838
This is first thing happens to you.

551
00:26:55,878 --> 00:26:59,020
Now if you have something serious

552
00:26:59,038 --> 00:27:01,717
or say something you have to operate somewhere

553
00:27:01,729 --> 00:27:03,767
then you are nervous already,

554
00:27:03,778 --> 00:27:04,640
“How can I do it?”

555
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,108
If you are nervous, then how can you operate?

556
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:09,866
And also because of specialisation

557
00:27:09,886 --> 00:27:11,815
you can only do one part.

558
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:14,124
I have known people, surgeons also,

559
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:16,825
who have opened the body they said, “No this is not my job.

560
00:27:16,855 --> 00:27:19,903
This is the job of that doctor.”

561
00:27:19,944 --> 00:27:23,025
So, you know the complete knowledge

562
00:27:23,035 --> 00:27:24,881
of medical science, complete!

563
00:27:24,904 --> 00:27:26,560
It’s not only surgery,

564
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:30,858
it’s not only what you call medicine and others;

565
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,942
we have learnt so many.

566
00:27:32,951 --> 00:27:35,651
So, all that becomes a totality.

567
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:37,105
In totality you know

568
00:27:37,111 --> 00:27:40,141
what is wrong with it on your fingertips.

569
00:27:40,156 --> 00:27:45,336
For diagnosis, you know a patient dies after it

570
00:27:45,349 --> 00:27:47,422
If somebody goes to say

571
00:27:47,450 --> 00:27:50,843
“Houston” for diagnosis,

572
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:52,132
you should insure him

573
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:54,771
because maybe he might die with diagnosis only.

574
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:55,853
It’s like this,

575
00:27:55,878 --> 00:27:58,333
here diagnosis is only on fingertips.

576
00:27:58,358 --> 00:28:00,467
On the fingertips you can feel very easily

577
00:28:00,463 --> 00:28:02,616
what is the central catch.

578
00:28:02,604 --> 00:28:03,757
Now if you learn

579
00:28:03,743 --> 00:28:04,646
or if you know

580
00:28:04,644 --> 00:28:06,987
what are these centres meant for,

581
00:28:06,993 --> 00:28:08,916
if you know what they are related to

582
00:28:08,933 --> 00:28:10,666
as far as your physical side is concerned

583
00:28:10,675 --> 00:28:11,797
for doctors,

584
00:28:11,816 --> 00:28:13,446
then you will know

585
00:28:13,468 --> 00:28:16,428
that this person is suffering from this disease.

586
00:28:16,458 --> 00:28:19,387
Even small children, say ten children,

587
00:28:19,387 --> 00:28:24,161
you tie up their eyes and ask them,

588
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:25,989
“What is this person suffering from?”

589
00:28:26,013 --> 00:28:28,412
So immediately supposing they give this

590
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:31,632
you ask that fellow, “What about your throat? Is it all right?”

591
00:28:31,618 --> 00:28:32,942
“Ah no, it is not all right.”

592
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,201
But how do they know?

593
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:36,659
Because on the fingertip they know,

594
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:38,229
they show the finger.

595
00:28:38,278 --> 00:28:40,788
So, everybody will say the same thing,

596
00:28:40,838 --> 00:28:42,999
because it is Absolute.

597
00:28:43,068 --> 00:28:44,542
This All-pervading Power

598
00:28:44,538 --> 00:28:46,512
about which people have talked about,

599
00:28:46,528 --> 00:28:48,182
they have called it Brahma Chaitanya

600
00:28:48,188 --> 00:28:50,123
They have called it all kinds of things

601
00:28:50,127 --> 00:28:52,712
but they don’t know what it is.

602
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:57,007
It is this power that starts flowing

603
00:28:57,008 --> 00:28:58,936
and when it starts flowing through you,

604
00:28:58,936 --> 00:29:01,106
tremendous things happen,

605
00:29:01,106 --> 00:29:03,957
tremendous things happen.

606
00:29:03,977 --> 00:29:05,678
I have known so many bureaucrats

607
00:29:05,676 --> 00:29:07,448
you see, were so much worried, upset;

608
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:09,948
because they were honest people and were suffering.

609
00:29:09,978 --> 00:29:10,978
They took to Sahaja Yoga.

610
00:29:10,988 --> 00:29:13,837
Their lives are changed now, they are enjoying themselves.

611
00:29:13,827 --> 00:29:15,357
They are not bothered.

612
00:29:15,357 --> 00:29:18,701
Because this not only guides you,

613
00:29:18,698 --> 00:29:20,371
this not only gives you knowledge

614
00:29:20,374 --> 00:29:22,590
but also protects you all the time.

615
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:23,813
I have seen many doctors

616
00:29:23,814 --> 00:29:25,942
who are doing say heart trouble.

617
00:29:25,953 --> 00:29:29,032
Heart patients they are looking after.

618
00:29:29,048 --> 00:29:31,959
There are doctors who are curing cancer patients

619
00:29:31,989 --> 00:29:36,778
I met one doctor who has a dialysis hospital;

620
00:29:36,838 --> 00:29:41,096
but his kidneys.

621
00:29:41,145 --> 00:29:43,892
I said, “Doctor, how have you got this?”

622
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:48,612
So, he is just treating only people for dialysis and he gets his kidneys

623
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:51,342
So, there is no protection.

624
00:29:51,353 --> 00:29:54,933
You should also have the protection as a surgeon has.

625
00:29:54,965 --> 00:29:57,016
He will tie up his hands and everything.

626
00:29:57,066 --> 00:30:01,253
But then otherwise normally doctors have no protection of any kind

627
00:30:01,281 --> 00:30:03,241
when they treat another person

628
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:04,711
and if they are sensitive,

629
00:30:04,771 --> 00:30:07,807
they may catch from them slowly, slowly the diseases,

630
00:30:07,832 --> 00:30:09,657
which they are going to cure.

631
00:30:09,689 --> 00:30:12,788
This is also a point nobody thinks of.

632
00:30:12,785 --> 00:30:15,498
We are not machines, we are human beings,

633
00:30:15,494 --> 00:30:19,969
we are not a stone, but we are sensitive

634
00:30:19,987 --> 00:30:22,548
and when you see somebody suffering

635
00:30:22,557 --> 00:30:25,273
you catch from them.

636
00:30:25,297 --> 00:30:26,548
You definitely catch

637
00:30:26,564 --> 00:30:29,006
but in Sahaja Yoga you know you are catching.

638
00:30:29,033 --> 00:30:31,706
In Sahaja Yoga you know what you are catching

639
00:30:31,726 --> 00:30:36,026
and you know how to clear it out and how to protect yourself.

640
00:30:36,096 --> 00:30:38,596
Now this is what one doesn’t understand

641
00:30:38,655 --> 00:30:42,093
that all human beings can get their Self-realisation,

642
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:43,173
all of them.

643
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,329
Only thing if you are thinking

644
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:49,363
that you are a great scientist

645
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:53,104
and you are above everything and you have read everything,

646
00:30:53,130 --> 00:30:55,078
“I don’t have to know anything”,

647
00:30:55,094 --> 00:30:56,858
then it doesn’t work.

648
00:30:56,874 --> 00:30:58,249
It cannot force.

649
00:30:58,253 --> 00:31:01,368
Sahaja Yoga cannot force on you its knowledge, nothing.

650
00:31:01,403 --> 00:31:05,027
It respects you, and respects your freedom.

651
00:31:05,041 --> 00:31:06,551
Freedom has been given to you

652
00:31:06,582 --> 00:31:10,082
whether you take to it or don’t take to it, is your own.

653
00:31:10,082 --> 00:31:15,071
But if you want it, if you are really desirous of getting it

654
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:17,041
then you get it.

655
00:31:17,048 --> 00:31:18,759
But with that you get knowledge

656
00:31:18,818 --> 00:31:20,801
not only about medical science

657
00:31:20,788 --> 00:31:23,222
but also about people.

658
00:31:23,266 --> 00:31:28,521
Now there are so many types of God men coming.

659
00:31:28,535 --> 00:31:30,994
Now how will you know they are not correct?

660
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:33,010
How will you?

661
00:31:33,050 --> 00:31:37,191
How will you know that Guru Nanaka was a great,

662
00:31:37,181 --> 00:31:39,951
not only saint but an incarnation?

663
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:41,443
How will you know about Christ?

664
00:31:41,493 --> 00:31:44,144
How will you know about anyone of them

665
00:31:44,153 --> 00:31:45,943
because you don’t know the Absolute?

666
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:47,321
You are born like that,

667
00:31:47,334 --> 00:31:49,134
but once you are born in Sahaja Yoga,

668
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:50,673
you become a Yogi.

669
00:31:50,723 --> 00:31:54,209
And then you know exactly that they are all one.

670
00:31:54,211 --> 00:31:55,769
All the Sufis are one,

671
00:31:55,770 --> 00:31:58,479
all these great Prophets are one.

672
00:31:58,509 --> 00:32:03,438
All these we can call them Prophets

673
00:32:03,451 --> 00:32:05,478
and also incarnations,

674
00:32:05,484 --> 00:32:07,807
they're altogether one.

675
00:32:07,785 --> 00:32:09,365
Christ himself has said,

676
00:32:09,434 --> 00:32:11,634
“Those who are not against us are with us.”

677
00:32:11,684 --> 00:32:14,046
But how many Christians understand this?

678
00:32:14,075 --> 00:32:16,756
So, there is no need to have different, different religions.

679
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,540
It’s in one big huge ocean of knowledge

680
00:32:20,590 --> 00:32:24,810
which has different, different, we can say, ports

681
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:27,618
but that doesn’t mean the ocean is different.

682
00:32:27,618 --> 00:32:29,614
All your problems will be solved

683
00:32:29,693 --> 00:32:33,584
as far as integration of religions are concerned

684
00:32:33,604 --> 00:32:36,034
and you don’t have to give up anything

685
00:32:36,036 --> 00:32:37,634
but respect everything

686
00:32:37,635 --> 00:32:42,263
in the right manner that you know about them.

687
00:32:42,271 --> 00:32:44,031
There is nothing to discard,

688
00:32:44,102 --> 00:32:46,684
nothing to condemn

689
00:32:46,701 --> 00:32:49,582
but you just, to know about them,

690
00:32:49,592 --> 00:32:51,628
then you are amazed

691
00:32:51,648 --> 00:32:54,871
how they are talking the same thing what you are talking.

692
00:32:54,878 --> 00:32:56,731
I have read a book

693
00:32:56,731 --> 00:33:01,611
written by a one great Sufi from Turkey

694
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:06,508
and another I have read it with our Nisamuddin

695
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:09,528
here who had written something

696
00:33:09,563 --> 00:33:11,978
and his disciples, just the same,

697
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:13,818
they write the same thing.

698
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,643
I mean there is no difference

699
00:33:15,663 --> 00:33:17,810
because absolute knowledge is the same,

700
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,730
only expression may be different.

701
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:22,461
They might use different expressions.

702
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:26,443
So, you get out of this madness of religion also.

703
00:33:26,443 --> 00:33:29,125
Religion can never teach you to hate anyone,

704
00:33:29,134 --> 00:33:30,005
can never,

705
00:33:30,064 --> 00:33:34,565
because I am talking here about the power of love.

706
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:38,213
This All-pervading Power is the power of love.

707
00:33:38,223 --> 00:33:39,233
It guides you;

708
00:33:39,253 --> 00:33:40,503
it looks after you,

709
00:33:40,554 --> 00:33:42,989
it cooperates, it coordinates.

710
00:33:43,009 --> 00:33:45,709
It is so efficient a government

711
00:33:45,738 --> 00:33:50,494
that I don’t think we can ever imagine how efficient it is

712
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:52,834
and it works just like this.

713
00:33:52,854 --> 00:33:54,693
Sometimes it is very amazing

714
00:33:54,713 --> 00:33:57,374
I will tell you now, today a case of a lady

715
00:33:57,463 --> 00:34:01,189
which is a true case. Is she here now?

716
00:34:01,193 --> 00:34:02,798
Mexican, no?

717
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,469
She might be here

718
00:34:04,479 --> 00:34:06,667
See, there's a lady. You are there!

719
00:34:06,669 --> 00:34:08,237
She is a lady here.

720
00:34:08,259 --> 00:34:12,172
She was working with the UN and when I went to New York, she got her Realisation

721
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:16,132
and she became a very ardent Sahaja Yogi.

722
00:34:16,141 --> 00:34:19,101
It rose to that thing where we call shraddha.

723
00:34:23,242 --> 00:34:25,867
Then she wrote to me three letters

724
00:34:25,927 --> 00:34:30,612
telling me about some disease her son has got

725
00:34:30,681 --> 00:34:34,902
who is only eighteen years of age studying in Harvard University or something.

726
00:34:35,001 --> 00:34:39,629
She said, “Mother this disease some people get it in my family at old age and they die.”

727
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,621
” It’s a special Mexican disease,

728
00:34:41,670 --> 00:34:44,059
it’s a big name as usual you see.

729
00:34:44,072 --> 00:34:48,333
So, I was thinking what to write to her

730
00:34:48,331 --> 00:34:50,682
and we’re just paying attention.

731
00:34:50,742 --> 00:34:54,253
And she said, “Should I bring my child there, what should I do?” and all that.

732
00:34:54,262 --> 00:34:56,063
And the fourth letter I find

733
00:34:56,143 --> 00:35:00,514
that the doctors have said that he is completely cured,

734
00:35:00,523 --> 00:35:02,405
there is nothing in it.

735
00:35:02,411 --> 00:35:04,947
Just imagine how quick it was.

736
00:35:07,065 --> 00:35:08,557
I mean, I was amazed.

737
00:35:08,563 --> 00:35:10,167
There are so many cases like that

738
00:35:10,182 --> 00:35:11,737
but this is something remarkable.

739
00:35:11,762 --> 00:35:14,231
Where is Mexico! I was in Pune

740
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:18,411
and just see how this Paramchaitanya has done it.

741
00:35:19,371 --> 00:35:21,621
How it is kind!

742
00:35:21,681 --> 00:35:26,039
It is the power of love of God which looks after you.

743
00:35:26,048 --> 00:35:27,778
After all the One who has created us,

744
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:31,018
the Creator is going to look after us, isn’t it?

745
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:38,677
But we should have also little attention towards finding out what is the truth.

746
00:35:38,684 --> 00:35:40,487
Don’t accept anything,

747
00:35:40,494 --> 00:35:42,977
you have to find out the truth first of all

748
00:35:42,994 --> 00:35:44,963
and everybody has said that

749
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:47,558
it is the same thing as everybody has said,

750
00:35:47,574 --> 00:35:49,364
you should know about yourself.

751
00:35:50,403 --> 00:35:52,458
Guru Nanaka’s thing I will say:

752
00:35:52,458 --> 00:35:58,774
Kahe ray Ban khojan Jai, Sada Niwasi Sada Alepa, Tohey sang samai

753
00:35:58,786 --> 00:36:03,418
Pusp maday jo Bas Basat Hai, Mukur Mahey ras chayi

754
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:08,244
Taisai hi Hari basay nirantar, Ghat hi khojo bhai

755
00:36:08,248 --> 00:36:12,704
Kahay nanak bin aapa chinay, Mitay na bhram ki kai’

756
00:36:12,744 --> 00:36:16,273
He said you must know yourself. “Know thyself” Christ has said.

757
00:36:16,364 --> 00:36:18,554
Everybody has said you should know yourself.

758
00:36:18,614 --> 00:36:20,534
Now what is that knowing yourself?

759
00:36:20,583 --> 00:36:24,540
That is nothing but you are

760
00:36:24,579 --> 00:36:27,590
the principle is that the truth is this

761
00:36:27,659 --> 00:36:31,506
that you are not this body, this mind,

762
00:36:31,516 --> 00:36:33,866
you are not these emotions,

763
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:36,246
you are not this ego,

764
00:36:36,366 --> 00:36:40,659
you are not these conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

765
00:36:40,659 --> 00:36:42,813
All our saints have said that.

766
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:45,452
Now we are not on that path.

767
00:36:45,472 --> 00:36:48,780
We are not looking out for what are we.

768
00:36:48,782 --> 00:36:50,214
If we are the Spirit,

769
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,224
then how are we to become the Spirit?

770
00:36:53,242 --> 00:36:55,524
Now anybody who starts talking like that,

771
00:36:55,565 --> 00:36:58,054
I mean, I was very much opposed by many people

772
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:00,985
because they thought I was just telling lies,

773
00:37:00,974 --> 00:37:05,241
I am this thing, that thing, but when they got sick, they came to Me.

774
00:37:05,241 --> 00:37:06,853
That’s not the way.

775
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:12,230
The way is to try to know that we do not know the absolute.

776
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:14,599
Once you become a little humble about it

777
00:37:14,592 --> 00:37:16,409
that we don’t know the absolute,

778
00:37:16,454 --> 00:37:19,704
so the religion and science become one

779
00:37:19,704 --> 00:37:24,884
because you can explain it scientifically as Dr. U.C. Rai has done

780
00:37:24,907 --> 00:37:28,407
Scientifically, you can explain what happens.

781
00:37:28,396 --> 00:37:30,016
Now you don’t have to become

782
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:33,289
what you call ‘karm-kandi’, ‘ritualistic’, no need

783
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:36,059
There is nothing to be done ritualistically, nothing.

784
00:37:36,088 --> 00:37:38,050
Once you are really realised,

785
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,708
you have to do a little meditation everyday,

786
00:37:40,719 --> 00:37:42,159
in the evening.

787
00:37:42,168 --> 00:37:47,905
Now what I also would I should say this Paramchaitanya

788
00:37:47,914 --> 00:37:51,563
that it gave us a chance to have a hospital in Vashi

789
00:37:51,565 --> 00:37:53,913
and the results are very good in Vashi.

790
00:37:53,945 --> 00:37:56,733
They never use to charge anything for the outdoor patients

791
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:58,036
but they said, “Mother,

792
00:37:58,032 --> 00:37:59,626
please allow us to take ten Rupees.”

793
00:37:59,655 --> 00:38:02,755
I said, “All right, take ten Rupees, is all right for everything."

794
00:38:02,766 --> 00:38:06,255
but the people who are living inside,

795
00:38:06,275 --> 00:38:08,413
they are also paying little amount;

796
00:38:08,436 --> 00:38:11,269
nothing compared to what people pay in the hospitals.

797
00:38:11,282 --> 00:38:14,932
And Dr. Rai has so sacrificingly accepted.

798
00:38:14,952 --> 00:38:17,708
And the doctors are coming from Russia all the way.

799
00:38:17,737 --> 00:38:20,748
You know, Russian doctors are wonderful doctors.

800
00:38:20,768 --> 00:38:23,597
They are very great scientists, I must say.

801
00:38:23,668 --> 00:38:29,786
They have gone very far in scientific approach.

802
00:38:29,836 --> 00:38:32,510
They have tried to find out the energies,

803
00:38:32,547 --> 00:38:33,797
which are subtle energies,

804
00:38:33,806 --> 00:38:35,385
and lots of things they have done,

805
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,246
but specially, they are very much interested

806
00:38:37,317 --> 00:38:42,074
in working through Sahaja Yoga and they are coming down here to work.

807
00:38:42,077 --> 00:38:46,364
Now I would not expect our doctors to come and work like that,

808
00:38:46,376 --> 00:38:48,864
but at least for once a week,

809
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:50,554
they can give some time

810
00:38:50,576 --> 00:38:57,019
and they can practice Sahaja Yoga just as a blessing to the people.

811
00:38:57,021 --> 00:38:59,422
Our country is full of very poor people,

812
00:38:59,431 --> 00:39:02,351
very, very poor people, extremely poor

813
00:39:02,362 --> 00:39:04,751
and we feel very much concerned.

814
00:39:04,782 --> 00:39:05,959
People always ask Me,

815
00:39:05,963 --> 00:39:07,929
“Yours is such a Yoga Bhoomi

816
00:39:07,943 --> 00:39:09,773
then, the, why the people are poor?

817
00:39:09,802 --> 00:39:11,043
The poor they are,

818
00:39:11,052 --> 00:39:14,708
because they do not follow the right path.

819
00:39:14,702 --> 00:39:16,909
You see, if they follow the right path,

820
00:39:16,932 --> 00:39:19,391
Lakshmi is also there to bless you.

821
00:39:19,429 --> 00:39:21,251
There is nothing to worry about money,

822
00:39:21,268 --> 00:39:22,986
nothing to worry about anything

823
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:28,836
and you become a person who is absolutely in balance.

824
00:39:28,842 --> 00:39:31,501
As soon as something comes up,

825
00:39:31,521 --> 00:39:32,952
some crisis come up,

826
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,561
immediately you all become silent

827
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:38,652
and you start seeing what’s wrong,

828
00:39:38,661 --> 00:39:40,032
what is the problem.

829
00:39:40,052 --> 00:39:41,962
Because you are not silent,

830
00:39:41,985 --> 00:39:43,112
always in the conflict,

831
00:39:43,125 --> 00:39:45,062
you cannot see the problem clearly

832
00:39:45,085 --> 00:39:47,062
and you cannot solve it,

833
00:39:47,065 --> 00:39:50,864
but, you actually, you don’t solve any problem.

834
00:39:50,885 --> 00:39:53,235
It is this, I must say this power.

835
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:56,409
I also tell them I don’t do anything; I am just sitting down;

836
00:39:56,409 --> 00:39:57,754
this power is doing everything.

837
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:58,904
They don’t believe it

838
00:39:58,909 --> 00:40:00,324
but it is a fact.

839
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,024
I am not doing anything, I am just sitting,

840
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:05,124
I am not planning, I am not doing anything whatsoever

841
00:40:05,135 --> 00:40:07,215
but this power does everything for us

842
00:40:07,264 --> 00:40:08,434
so why should I do it.

843
00:40:08,505 --> 00:40:12,746
But, it’s rather difficult for human beings to leave things to this power.

844
00:40:12,764 --> 00:40:16,226
Even some doctors, who have been practising Medical Science

845
00:40:16,244 --> 00:40:20,065
have had very funny experiences

846
00:40:20,076 --> 00:40:22,746
Like there’s one Dr. Amjad Ali in Australia

847
00:40:22,766 --> 00:40:24,703
who is very well qualified

848
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:27,513
and he was experimenting

849
00:40:27,516 --> 00:40:30,947
on some sort of “kya kar rahe they.”

850
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:36,907
So, you see that what he found

851
00:40:36,987 --> 00:40:41,048
when he went close to them, they start becoming smaller.

852
00:40:41,056 --> 00:40:42,228
He could not experiment.

853
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:44,588
He said, “How my experiment will go?

854
00:40:44,623 --> 00:40:48,173
Because I cannot! As soon as I go near them, everything disappears,

855
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:49,380
all the disease disappears,

856
00:40:49,403 --> 00:40:50,360
so what can I do?”

857
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:52,460
I said, “You don’t experiment with that

858
00:40:52,469 --> 00:40:57,380
but you can experiment with the people who are already sick and do something about it.”

859
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,849
So, there are many things like that.

860
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:00,951
And another person told me that in England

861
00:41:00,949 --> 00:41:03,320
there is a craze for research.

862
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:08,869
So, one scientist, they told him, “You find out what is minus 273,

863
00:41:08,929 --> 00:41:10,260
the absolute zero.

864
00:41:10,329 --> 00:41:15,627
So, he said, “I cannot, because the formula is such that some heat will remain always there.”

865
00:41:15,628 --> 00:41:16,647
I said, “All right,

866
00:41:16,644 --> 00:41:18,277
do one thing,

867
00:41:18,284 --> 00:41:21,844
you go and tell them this is absolute and how can we find absolute.”

868
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:23,641
“We cannot find Absolute.

869
00:41:23,675 --> 00:41:27,032
It is absolutely, absolutely beyond us”.

870
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:30,711
Then I said, “You use vibrations and you use these Divine vibrations.”

871
00:41:30,724 --> 00:41:33,777
And he achieved it. He got his doctorate and he did it.

872
00:41:33,784 --> 00:41:35,318
So, they asked him, “How did you do it?”

873
00:41:35,327 --> 00:41:37,108
He said, “I cannot explain to you.”

874
00:41:37,106 --> 00:41:38,478
“Because if I talk to them,

875
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,797
they will never listen to me.

876
00:41:39,806 --> 00:41:42,179
These scientists, you know, they think no end of themselves.

877
00:41:42,197 --> 00:41:45,278
How can I tell them that I did it with this Divine Power?”

878
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:47,896
They cannot believe that there is another big power

879
00:41:47,916 --> 00:41:49,795
After all who runs our heart?

880
00:41:49,815 --> 00:41:52,405
Ask the doctors who runs our heart.

881
00:41:52,425 --> 00:41:54,275
They will say Autonomous Nervous System.

882
00:41:54,306 --> 00:41:56,266
Now who is this Auto?

883
00:41:56,275 --> 00:41:57,813
Ask this question second one.

884
00:41:57,826 --> 00:41:58,903
You can’t answer.

885
00:41:58,918 --> 00:42:00,164
Who is this Auto?

886
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,304
‘Auto’ you don’t know.

887
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:02,387
They will just…

888
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:04,730
But they are honest because they say, “We don’t know”

889
00:42:04,719 --> 00:42:07,240
and they have put it the name ‘Autonomous’.

890
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,260
Now I am talking of parasympathetic nervous system,

891
00:42:10,264 --> 00:42:12,061
as you know very well.

892
00:42:12,074 --> 00:42:14,331
And we know very little about parasympathetic.

893
00:42:14,344 --> 00:42:15,370
It’s a fact.

894
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,891
How for other people

895
00:42:16,898 --> 00:42:21,648
I will tell you that in very simple words what is parasympathetic.

896
00:42:21,668 --> 00:42:24,057
Now when there is some emergency,

897
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:27,579
our sympathetic nervous system which is to the left and right side

898
00:42:27,579 --> 00:42:29,882
go into motion.

899
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,353
Like, we have to run,

900
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:36,103
then if you are running, our heart will start pumping blood.

901
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,463
But what brings it back to normal,

902
00:42:39,478 --> 00:42:42,119
is the parasympathetic, in simple words.

903
00:42:45,989 --> 00:42:49,202
So, this parasympathetic nervous system,

904
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,413
when it is filled with energy,

905
00:42:51,396 --> 00:42:54,943
when it is filled with energy it just settles down.

906
00:42:54,956 --> 00:42:56,632
It gets nourished

907
00:42:56,655 --> 00:43:00,282
and then it starts working in such a beautiful manner

908
00:43:00,306 --> 00:43:05,103
that you achieve so many things which you could not normally achieve.

909
00:43:05,114 --> 00:43:09,695
First thing that happens that you become a very peaceful personality,

910
00:43:11,264 --> 00:43:13,434
very peaceful.

911
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:15,606
Because we are thinking,

912
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:19,617
now the thoughts are rising and falling, again thoughts are rising and falling,

913
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:21,757
again thoughts are rising and falling.

914
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:25,666
All the time we are jumping on the cusp of the thoughts.

915
00:43:25,686 --> 00:43:28,927
But there is a space in between

916
00:43:28,967 --> 00:43:31,396
and that is in Sanskrit called ‘vilambha’.

917
00:43:31,456 --> 00:43:34,922
But we can call it ‘pause’ in English language.

918
00:43:34,931 --> 00:43:37,972
Now this is the time

919
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:41,201
where we never see that point.

920
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,612
We never are there.

921
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,081
So, when we are jumping,

922
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,867
we are jumping in the future or in the past

923
00:43:46,864 --> 00:43:49,153
For example, just now, you are sitting before Me,

924
00:43:49,143 --> 00:43:51,563
maybe you are thinking if they will get a train or not,

925
00:43:51,574 --> 00:43:53,713
a bus or not, this and that,

926
00:43:53,773 --> 00:43:56,184
or maybe you are thinking about your past.

927
00:43:56,233 --> 00:43:58,856
But you cannot be in the centre.

928
00:43:58,884 --> 00:44:00,407
This is the big problem.

929
00:44:00,427 --> 00:44:04,246
You cannot be in the present.

930
00:44:04,257 --> 00:44:07,197
If I say, “Be in the present”, you cannot.

931
00:44:07,217 --> 00:44:09,657
And in the present is reality.

932
00:44:09,677 --> 00:44:14,016
In the present is totality and in the present is silence.

933
00:44:14,016 --> 00:44:15,606
You don’t think.

934
00:44:15,615 --> 00:44:19,001
So, according to even to Patanjali

935
00:44:18,996 --> 00:44:21,501
you have to become Nirvichar.

936
00:44:21,510 --> 00:44:23,952
These thoughts which are bombarding your head,

937
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:26,632
you have to become in charge of them,

938
00:44:26,702 --> 00:44:28,702
you have to be in control with them.

939
00:44:28,692 --> 00:44:31,188
So, what happens? You become Nirvichar,

940
00:44:31,192 --> 00:44:32,478
without any thoughts.

941
00:44:32,512 --> 00:44:33,947
It’s a thoughtless awareness.

942
00:44:33,945 --> 00:44:36,878
And this thoughtless awareness

943
00:44:36,896 --> 00:44:41,478
is the one that gives you complete peace within yourself.

944
00:44:41,485 --> 00:44:43,409
People talk of peace, other.

945
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:45,735
I know of people who have got peace awards,

946
00:44:45,728 --> 00:44:48,741
big, big, such hot-tempered people

947
00:44:48,751 --> 00:44:52,324
that you have to approach them with a barge pole.

948
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:55,934
I don’t know from what angle they are talking about peace

949
00:44:55,965 --> 00:44:58,076
but they have got peace awards.

950
00:44:58,096 --> 00:45:01,708
Big, big people like that I have known who have got peace awards.

951
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:04,076
Peace has to come within.

952
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,521
When human beings become peaceful,

953
00:45:06,525 --> 00:45:07,815
there won’t be any quarrels,

954
00:45:07,856 --> 00:45:12,050
no fights, no wars and no politics.

955
00:45:12,067 --> 00:45:13,577
If you are peaceful,

956
00:45:13,646 --> 00:45:16,110
then you are so satisfied,

957
00:45:16,137 --> 00:45:20,510
you're as in Hindi, they say, “Apney me hi sama jatey hai,”

958
00:45:20,496 --> 00:45:22,789
you are satisfied with yourself.

959
00:45:22,791 --> 00:45:26,757
You don’t get into the mad rush

960
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,018
of approaching somebody, encroaching somebody,

961
00:45:32,056 --> 00:45:34,175
aggressing on someone;

962
00:45:34,186 --> 00:45:37,876
no, you are with yourself in complete peace.

963
00:45:37,896 --> 00:45:41,065
As a result, so many things happen.

964
00:45:41,115 --> 00:45:44,239
Maybe I am the oldest person living here.

965
00:45:44,228 --> 00:45:47,668
Nobody can be more in age

966
00:45:47,717 --> 00:45:50,034
because I am seventy-four now. I will be seventy-five.

967
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:51,295
So, you can imagine.

968
00:45:51,318 --> 00:45:56,929
But at peace when you are, you are not having any such ideas of aggression,

969
00:45:56,949 --> 00:45:58,489
aggression or anything.

970
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:01,070
You become absolutely peaceful

971
00:46:01,088 --> 00:46:04,193
and this peace is very required today

972
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:06,728
for this world to come to something

973
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,563
which we call as a peaceful world.

974
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:12,733
By fighting, by quarrelling you can never achieve peace.

975
00:46:12,748 --> 00:46:15,478
I have seen people going with the flags,

976
00:46:15,547 --> 00:46:19,039
now fight for peace and fight for this, no need.

977
00:46:19,018 --> 00:46:22,820
If you become peaceful everything works out so well

978
00:46:22,827 --> 00:46:26,521
and this Paramchaitanya is with you to help you.

979
00:46:26,545 --> 00:46:28,791
There is no need to fight anybody,

980
00:46:28,806 --> 00:46:32,070
to aggress anybody or to trouble anybody

981
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:35,121
This is very important for doctors

982
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:37,862
and for also business people

983
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:39,681
Now the problem of business people

984
00:46:39,681 --> 00:46:42,061
because they told me there are some business people also

985
00:46:42,092 --> 00:46:45,411
is their stress which is a common disease.

986
00:46:45,422 --> 00:46:48,264
They are the same, very futuristic, you know,

987
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:51,447
all the time calculating, very, very futuristic.

988
00:46:51,443 --> 00:46:53,697
And in America, a new disease has developed,

989
00:46:53,713 --> 00:46:55,364
they call it ‘yuppies disease'

990
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:11,978
That disease is such a horrible thing it is,

991
00:47:12,059 --> 00:47:15,527
it is that your rational mind just goes out,

992
00:47:15,548 --> 00:47:17,748
your conscious mind just goes out,

993
00:47:17,769 --> 00:47:19,648
you can’t even lift your hand,

994
00:47:19,659 --> 00:47:21,987
you can’t even lift your fingers

995
00:47:22,014 --> 00:47:26,731
and people carry you just like what you can call a

996
00:47:26,733 --> 00:47:28,382
reptile on your body.

997
00:47:28,393 --> 00:47:30,351
You can think all right,

998
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:35,574
you can talk all right,

999
00:47:35,664 --> 00:47:37,222
you can plan all right,

1000
00:47:37,235 --> 00:47:38,882
calculate all right

1001
00:47:38,882 --> 00:47:39,961
but you cannot walk,

1002
00:47:39,942 --> 00:47:41,181
you cannot lift your hand,

1003
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,052
you cannot do anything.

1004
00:47:43,072 --> 00:47:45,911
This is a new disease that has come in America

1005
00:47:45,922 --> 00:47:50,335
and is spreading all over and I have seen one patient also here.

1006
00:47:50,355 --> 00:47:54,684
So, what I am trying to say that going with this your stress,

1007
00:47:54,686 --> 00:47:57,074
all kind of things can happen.

1008
00:47:57,105 --> 00:48:00,356
Now why this stress is there, that also we should know.

1009
00:48:01,666 --> 00:48:03,103
First of all,

1010
00:48:03,094 --> 00:48:06,302
the Kundalini has started working in this Kali Yuga

1011
00:48:06,304 --> 00:48:07,552
in these times.

1012
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:09,961
Secondly, if you see these two centres,

1013
00:48:09,978 --> 00:48:12,458
two Nadis or two channels,

1014
00:48:12,509 --> 00:48:14,289
we call Ida and Pingala Nadi.

1015
00:48:14,298 --> 00:48:18,594
So, the Pingala Nadi creates Ego within us,

1016
00:48:18,619 --> 00:48:20,414
as it is shown there,

1017
00:48:20,418 --> 00:48:21,574
you see, the yellow one.

1018
00:48:21,577 --> 00:48:25,655
It creates a balloon like.

1019
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,996
Then the second one is the Ida Nadi

1020
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:32,385
which also creates a balloon.

1021
00:48:32,407 --> 00:48:35,603
Now Ida [Pingala] Nadi creates the ego balloon

1022
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:40,364
and the left side one creates the superego, means conditionings

1023
00:48:40,387 --> 00:48:42,284
Now if you are identified with something,

1024
00:48:42,291 --> 00:48:44,213
if you are conditioned within you with something,

1025
00:48:44,231 --> 00:48:46,202
then these two are there.

1026
00:48:46,262 --> 00:48:48,456
But when you are too much right sided,

1027
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:53,099
these are all – you see the ego moves and covers the left side.

1028
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:55,469
So, there is a blockage, complete blockage.

1029
00:48:55,528 --> 00:48:57,929
Now whatever problems you have

1030
00:48:57,989 --> 00:49:00,485
they cannot pass out of your body.

1031
00:49:00,492 --> 00:49:02,775
That makes you weaker and weaker

1032
00:49:02,782 --> 00:49:05,715
and that’s how you have stress.

1033
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,306
With this Kundalini,

1034
00:49:07,324 --> 00:49:09,445
these two move out like that

1035
00:49:09,503 --> 00:49:14,204
and is opened out and you become one with this Divine Power.

1036
00:49:14,233 --> 00:49:18,327
Now as far as the brain is, for there are some neurosurgeons also,

1037
00:49:18,353 --> 00:49:20,496
as far as the brain is concerned,

1038
00:49:20,556 --> 00:49:23,317
we know that we use wee part of our brain,

1039
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,266
very little part of our brain.

1040
00:49:25,266 --> 00:49:29,085
But once you get this Kundalini then it enlightens

1041
00:49:29,096 --> 00:49:34,326
so many areas of your head that you just know

1042
00:49:34,396 --> 00:49:36,556
Sometimes people ask Me, “Mother, how do you know?”

1043
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:39,356
“I know. I don’t know how I know.”

1044
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,007
There is no technique for it.

1045
00:49:41,007 --> 00:49:42,177
Just I know.

1046
00:49:42,197 --> 00:49:43,936
They say, “Mother, how do you know this thing?

1047
00:49:43,958 --> 00:49:44,976
How do you know?”

1048
00:49:44,987 --> 00:49:46,286
Somebody wrote me a letter

1049
00:49:46,307 --> 00:49:48,626
and I said, “Who has written this letter, I know.”

1050
00:49:48,637 --> 00:49:50,025
And I told them,

1051
00:49:50,025 --> 00:49:51,496
they said, “Mother, how do you know?”

1052
00:49:51,525 --> 00:49:54,786
I said, “I know for definite this is the one who has written.”

1053
00:49:54,786 --> 00:49:56,615
I don’t know that person. I have never seen him.

1054
00:49:56,615 --> 00:49:58,554
I've never seen his hand writing

1055
00:49:58,635 --> 00:50:00,775
but I said, “I know who has written this letter.”

1056
00:50:00,771 --> 00:50:02,135
Just I know.

1057
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:05,458
But I wouldn’t say that it’s something great

1058
00:50:05,488 --> 00:50:09,097
that I should know because I just know without any work,

1059
00:50:09,092 --> 00:50:11,556
without any thinking,

1060
00:50:11,577 --> 00:50:15,259
without any managing. Just automatically I know everything.

1061
00:50:15,327 --> 00:50:18,867
So, once you become that, you don’t have to worry.

1062
00:50:18,916 --> 00:50:23,817
Now, for example, I know, also, a lady doctor in Delhi,

1063
00:50:23,856 --> 00:50:25,485
no in Bombay.

1064
00:50:25,496 --> 00:50:28,295
She is the one who is a surgeon.

1065
00:50:28,297 --> 00:50:34,652
She said, “Mother I could know that this man has tumour,

1066
00:50:34,652 --> 00:50:38,652
very much low in his brains but it will come out.”

1067
00:50:38,663 --> 00:50:42,402
So, she said, “Then I was just giving vibrations first.

1068
00:50:42,416 --> 00:50:45,059
I said let me try first the vibrations on that.”

1069
00:50:45,056 --> 00:50:47,659
They said, “No, No, there is no tumour on that side.”

1070
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,489
She said, “It is here. I know I can feel it; it is here.”

1071
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:52,818
They wouldn’t, they started arguing with her

1072
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:55,364
and then they found out the tumour where she said,

1073
00:50:55,376 --> 00:50:56,753
exactly there.

1074
00:50:56,766 --> 00:50:58,094
They said, “How do you know?”

1075
00:50:58,115 --> 00:51:00,322
She said, “I don’t know how do I know.”

1076
00:51:00,346 --> 00:51:03,474
So even the children can tell where is the problem,

1077
00:51:03,476 --> 00:51:07,804
in your head, in your brain, what is happening.

1078
00:51:07,804 --> 00:51:13,155
Now to look after your brain is very important that you don’t go into imbalances

1079
00:51:13,146 --> 00:51:14,916
because if you go into imbalance,

1080
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:18,650
your right side will develop or your left side will develop.

1081
00:51:18,668 --> 00:51:20,929
Actually, the right side develops on the left

1082
00:51:20,938 --> 00:51:23,280
and the left side develops on the right.

1083
00:51:23,257 --> 00:51:26,668
Now also I don’t know how far the medical science has gone

1084
00:51:26,717 --> 00:51:30,608
up to the understanding as to left and right side

1085
00:51:30,668 --> 00:51:34,434
are two different complementary systems.

1086
00:51:34,489 --> 00:51:36,949
I don’t know if that they accept, do they?

1087
00:51:40,282 --> 00:51:46,045
But in Sahaja Yoga you will discover that there are two complementary systems.

1088
00:51:48,275 --> 00:51:51,119
One is right sided; one is left sided.

1089
00:51:51,135 --> 00:51:55,259
And when the right side is too much then the left side might act

1090
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:58,559
or when the left side is too much, then right side may act.

1091
00:51:58,568 --> 00:52:01,159
You see it’s a complimentary two systems

1092
00:52:01,228 --> 00:52:03,847
and if you go on one system all the time

1093
00:52:03,896 --> 00:52:07,097
then you become right sided or left sided.

1094
00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:09,907
Now left sided are the people who are not futuristic

1095
00:52:09,916 --> 00:52:13,436
but who are the people who live in the past.

1096
00:52:13,445 --> 00:52:17,036
Now of course I don’t want to, just now, discuss about it very much

1097
00:52:17,059 --> 00:52:21,862
because it’s also more confusing for people.

1098
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:23,521
Because they don’t want to believe

1099
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:25,918
that there is something like dead souls

1100
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:32,512
or they don’t want to believe in the viruses being dead vegetables

1101
00:52:32,516 --> 00:52:35,764
and things like that but it is.

1102
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:37,213
On the left-hand side,

1103
00:52:37,204 --> 00:52:40,463
we have got all our past since our creation.

1104
00:52:40,463 --> 00:52:42,875
So, if somebody gets virus you give antibiotics,

1105
00:52:42,889 --> 00:52:45,894
you do what you like, it won’t go.

1106
00:52:45,918 --> 00:52:48,570
Only Sahaja Yoga can drive it out.

1107
00:52:48,570 --> 00:52:51,735
Only through Sahaja Yoga you can cure viruses

1108
00:52:51,750 --> 00:52:54,659
because only Sahaja Yoga can act on the left side.

1109
00:52:54,670 --> 00:52:59,829
Many mad people, crazy people have been cured through Sahaja Yoga.

1110
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:05,853
Also, it gives you a good idea about

1111
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,914
how you can show people,

1112
00:53:08,923 --> 00:53:11,492
who is mad and who is not mad.

1113
00:53:11,494 --> 00:53:14,563
Like I had a program in Pune in the beginning

1114
00:53:14,563 --> 00:53:20,943
and they arranged it in a hall which was owned by some Brahmins.

1115
00:53:20,976 --> 00:53:24,230
So, when I went there, they said, “No, no, She is not a Brahmin

1116
00:53:24,215 --> 00:53:25,880
so we can’t give Her the hall.

1117
00:53:25,891 --> 00:53:27,739
So, Sahaja Yogis were mischievous,

1118
00:53:27,771 --> 00:53:30,989
they said, “All right, we will give it in the newspaper that they are refusing

1119
00:53:31,001 --> 00:53:32,489
because She is not a Brahmin.”

1120
00:53:32,492 --> 00:53:35,208
“No, no, don’t do like that we will have it.”

1121
00:53:35,231 --> 00:53:37,989
So, I didn’t know what was happening behind the back.

1122
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,809
When I went there, I was sitting there.

1123
00:53:39,818 --> 00:53:44,273
Very interesting I saw about twenty-five people sitting in front of me shaking

1124
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,842
like this

1125
00:53:45,853 --> 00:53:46,998
“Mother, stop it, stop it

1126
00:53:47,012 --> 00:53:48,393
we know Your powers, stop it.”

1127
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:50,163
I said, “I am not doing anything, you are….”

1128
00:53:50,182 --> 00:53:54,030
They said, “Now, also there are people who are shaking like this.”

1129
00:53:54,023 --> 00:53:56,460
So, I said, “Ask them, who they are?”

1130
00:53:56,476 --> 00:54:00,739
They said, “We are certified mad from Thana.

1131
00:54:00,746 --> 00:54:03,106
We have come here with our superintendent

1132
00:54:03,126 --> 00:54:05,670
because You had cured one mad man.”

1133
00:54:05,679 --> 00:54:09,130
“So”, they said, “Are we also mad?” “Yes, there is something wrong.”

1134
00:54:09,148 --> 00:54:10,719
So, the thing was

1135
00:54:10,739 --> 00:54:13,998
they were thinking the Brahmins are the highest or something like that.

1136
00:54:14,028 --> 00:54:16,382
Is all nonsensical ideas

1137
00:54:16,411 --> 00:54:19,190
because Brahmin is that which knows the Brahma,

1138
00:54:19,211 --> 00:54:21,889
which knows All Pervading Power.

1139
00:54:21,911 --> 00:54:25,742
And because of these funny ideas, they have tortured all the saints.

1140
00:54:25,802 --> 00:54:28,260
Specially in Maharashtra

1141
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,179
people have tortured all the saints all the time.

1142
00:54:32,204 --> 00:54:35,423
So, where you have so many saints

1143
00:54:35,474 --> 00:54:36,636
and so many people

1144
00:54:36,646 --> 00:54:40,081
then you must know that it was just to work out

1145
00:54:40,099 --> 00:54:43,451
the brains of these close-minded people.

1146
00:54:43,478 --> 00:54:48,699
But to open them out is only possible I think when they are in difficulties.

1147
00:54:48,759 --> 00:54:51,695
When they are not in difficulties they don’t want to accept.

1148
00:54:51,708 --> 00:54:54,704
Supposing they are sick then they will come to Me.

1149
00:54:54,717 --> 00:54:58,333
Now if you cure somebody sick, you see once he is cured, he is finished.

1150
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:01,684
He doesn’t do any Sahaja Yoga; he doesn’t want to help anyone.

1151
00:55:01,693 --> 00:55:05,853
But if there is a person who is healthy,

1152
00:55:05,884 --> 00:55:08,188
who is perfectly all right

1153
00:55:08,184 --> 00:55:10,639
and who is knowledgeable,

1154
00:55:10,634 --> 00:55:13,079
if he comes to Sahaja Yoga, he will be such a help

1155
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,581
to this, I should say, to this poor country.

1156
00:55:17,588 --> 00:55:20,880
This country is suffering from tremendous poverty.

1157
00:55:20,898 --> 00:55:22,744
Now only saying,

1158
00:55:22,773 --> 00:55:26,164
“Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao, Garibi Hatao” (“Eliminate poverty!”)

1159
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:29,554
I know of one gentleman who was a great corrupt fellow

1160
00:55:29,574 --> 00:55:33,030
and who used to live in one room with a little cot.

1161
00:55:33,050 --> 00:55:34,882
I said, “Why do you live like this?”

1162
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:37,822
He said, “Because, everybody is garib [poor] so I want to live like garib.”

1163
00:55:37,831 --> 00:55:40,052
I said, “Why don’t you give all this money to these garibs?

1164
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,911
Why are you lying like this?”

1165
00:55:41,931 --> 00:55:44,550
He said, “All right, you suggest to me any organisation

1166
00:55:44,621 --> 00:55:48,931
which is absolutely above board and I will move.”

1167
00:55:48,931 --> 00:55:51,588
That was a difficult thing, a decision.

1168
00:55:51,590 --> 00:55:52,847
But what I am trying to say

1169
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:55,289
only by saying people are garib, garib,

1170
00:55:55,349 --> 00:55:57,679
you have to attend to that

1171
00:55:57,699 --> 00:56:00,179
and is only possible through Sahaja Yoga.

1172
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,320
How?

1173
00:56:01,326 --> 00:56:05,885
Sahaja Yoga is practiced mostly by middle class.

1174
00:56:05,905 --> 00:56:10,275
Both the sides are – one side are the poor, another side are the rich.

1175
00:56:10,346 --> 00:56:13,655
Rich are very few. But more by the middle class.

1176
00:56:13,668 --> 00:56:17,545
Then it’s like a river which expands on both the sides

1177
00:56:17,565 --> 00:56:22,092
This time I was, I mean, I have been always thinking that

1178
00:56:22,094 --> 00:56:24,905
I have to do something for the poor people,

1179
00:56:24,932 --> 00:56:28,324
something, always and I have done also, on my own,

1180
00:56:28,338 --> 00:56:31,494
but I wanted Sahaja Yogis to contribute, Indian Sahaja Yogis.

1181
00:56:31,489 --> 00:56:34,143
So, I told them I want to start a place

1182
00:56:34,139 --> 00:56:37,878
where we could have these women

1183
00:56:37,873 --> 00:56:41,963
who are standing on the roads with their children asking for alms.

1184
00:56:42,007 --> 00:56:44,814
We can have something to help them.

1185
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:48,018
Immediately, I was surprised Sahaja Yogis contributed to me

1186
00:56:48,047 --> 00:56:52,237
for that and I was so amazed at their enthusiasm.

1187
00:56:52,260 --> 00:56:54,061
I said, “This is the generosity.

1188
00:56:54,112 --> 00:56:57,039
This generosity that has come to Sahaja Yogis.”

1189
00:56:57,050 --> 00:57:01,630
And then when they said, “Mother this is we have got all this through Sahaja Yoga

1190
00:57:01,650 --> 00:57:05,710
We have improved so much that we don’t have to worry.”

1191
00:57:05,744 --> 00:57:10,063
And they so generously, I mean a person becomes extremely generous.

1192
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:12,143
He becomes very peaceful;

1193
00:57:12,164 --> 00:57:16,514
he becomes generous and he starts enjoying the generosity.

1194
00:57:16,518 --> 00:57:19,014
I mean people earn such a lot of money.

1195
00:57:19,009 --> 00:57:21,668
Everything they should do there is no harm.

1196
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:24,438
In Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing like sanyasa.

1197
00:57:24,498 --> 00:57:26,242
Nobody has to take sanyas.

1198
00:57:26,228 --> 00:57:29,003
Nobody has to go out of his family,

1199
00:57:29,032 --> 00:57:33,974
out of his … nothing. It’s all here. Why to go anywhere?

1200
00:57:33,974 --> 00:57:37,440
So, you have to be a very normal person.

1201
00:57:37,489 --> 00:57:39,789
But one thing is important,

1202
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:44,673
you must have the pure desire to get your Realisation.

1203
00:57:44,692 --> 00:57:48,731
If you don’t have that pure Realisation then it doesn’t work out.

1204
00:57:48,742 --> 00:57:50,574
Apart from that it might work

1205
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,213
but you go on dropping down

1206
00:57:52,224 --> 00:57:54,786
because if you want to make money out of Sahaja Yoga

1207
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:58,976
or if you want to, say, achieve some power out of it.

1208
00:57:58,974 --> 00:58:00,282
You see, you are so powerful

1209
00:58:00,304 --> 00:58:03,547
that you don’t have to ask for power or anything.

1210
00:58:03,572 --> 00:58:07,097
You don’t know how it works and how it gives.

1211
00:58:07,103 --> 00:58:09,887
First of all, only we have to believe

1212
00:58:09,887 --> 00:58:15,108
that we are reflections of God Almighty.

1213
00:58:15,128 --> 00:58:17,668
We're not just human beings.

1214
00:58:17,677 --> 00:58:21,159
Specially, to be born in India

1215
00:58:21,168 --> 00:58:23,141
you must have done lots of punyas,

1216
00:58:23,168 --> 00:58:27,509
otherwise you cannot be born in this great country I can tell you.

1217
00:58:27,539 --> 00:58:31,188
All this, you see, is all nonsense that is going on,

1218
00:58:31,199 --> 00:58:34,757
is just skirmishes on the periphery,

1219
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:38,769
but if you see the culture,

1220
00:58:38,820 --> 00:58:42,061
the love, affection we have,

1221
00:58:42,074 --> 00:58:45,351
the understanding of value system we have,

1222
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,621
you can’t imagine it.

1223
00:58:46,646 --> 00:58:48,670
When you go abroad, you are amazed.

1224
00:58:48,686 --> 00:58:51,590
you don’t know how to tell them.

1225
00:58:51,605 --> 00:58:52,920
They're so stupid,

1226
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:56,871
I tell you, very stupid people, nothing to learn from them.

1227
00:58:56,931 --> 00:59:01,820
I have been fighting with the stupidity of people specially Americans.

1228
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,023
I'm surprised, I think that they are not yet grown up as human beings.

1229
00:59:06,045 --> 00:59:08,123
The way they talk, the way they understand.

1230
00:59:08,135 --> 00:59:11,818
They only like people who will come and tell them stories

1231
00:59:11,844 --> 00:59:14,574
and make fool out of them, make lot of money.

1232
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:16,897
To me they said, “We cannot take to Sahaja Yoga.”

1233
00:59:16,876 --> 00:59:17,917
I said, “Why?”

1234
00:59:17,905 --> 00:59:19,193
“Because you don’t take money,

1235
00:59:19,206 --> 00:59:20,945
what is your validity?

1236
00:59:20,956 --> 00:59:23,485
If you don’t take money then you have no validity,

1237
00:59:23,545 --> 00:59:26,283
why should we believe in you because …”

1238
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:30,073
I said, “Supposing I take money, then?” “Then we can prosecute you.”

1239
00:59:30,088 --> 00:59:32,813
I said, “Go and prosecute all these people who have looted you”.

1240
00:59:32,827 --> 00:59:34,933
Nobody could prosecute them.

1241
00:59:34,947 --> 00:59:40,619
So, this is we should not look to them for understanding of life.

1242
00:59:40,623 --> 00:59:42,018
They have not yet understood.

1243
00:59:42,038 --> 00:59:44,179
We have to look to ourselves.

1244
00:59:44,184 --> 00:59:46,250
We have such a heritage.

1245
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:48,409
You can imagine, thousands of years back,

1246
00:59:48,403 --> 00:59:50,443
we have been talking of Brahma,

1247
00:59:50,494 --> 00:59:55,818
we have been talking of absolute truth.

1248
00:59:55,838 --> 00:59:59,118
In what country they have this kind of knowledge.

1249
00:59:59,118 --> 01:00:00,105
No country.

1250
01:00:00,108 --> 01:00:04,472
So, first of all we should be very proud to be an Indian.

1251
01:00:04,489 --> 01:00:05,911
That’s very important.

1252
01:00:05,922 --> 01:00:08,661
Even Sahaja Yogis from abroad they dress up like Indians

1253
01:00:08,702 --> 01:00:10,791
and they have taken to our culture,

1254
01:00:10,791 --> 01:00:12,478
our style of culture.

1255
01:00:12,467 --> 01:00:14,833
I need not tell you about the Western Culture

1256
01:00:14,893 --> 01:00:17,507
as I was really shocked.

1257
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:20,195
Then I thought I better write down something about them

1258
01:00:20,204 --> 01:00:21,965
as a witness whatever I saw.

1259
01:00:21,963 --> 01:00:24,344
So, there is nothing to learn from them,

1260
01:00:24,414 --> 01:00:28,353
but one day will come, they have to come here.

1261
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:30,822
All the doctors have to come here.

1262
01:00:30,851 --> 01:00:34,902
I am very thankful, very, very thankful

1263
01:00:34,911 --> 01:00:38,672
to this Indian Medical Association especially.

1264
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:44,382
I never expected and I am very grateful to them for this

1265
01:00:44,385 --> 01:00:48,432
because I know in this country if the doctors take it up,

1266
01:00:48,452 --> 01:00:52,037
all over the world they will have to understand

1267
01:00:58,125 --> 01:01:04,918
the value of our knowledge of life and of Medical Science.

1268
01:01:04,918 --> 01:01:08,389
I would say that I have seen so many people sitting here

1269
01:01:08,429 --> 01:01:09,790
I don’t know how many are doctors,

1270
01:01:09,798 --> 01:01:13,480
how many are from industries and how many are Sahaja Yogis.

1271
01:01:13,476 --> 01:01:16,990
Whatever it is, one has to know that all of us

1272
01:01:17,003 --> 01:01:20,614
are blessed by the same reflection of God Almighty

1273
01:01:20,673 --> 01:01:23,582
within ourselves which we should experience.

1274
01:01:23,606 --> 01:01:27,072
After that you will tell me what has happened to you,

1275
01:01:27,076 --> 01:01:30,202
what you have felt and what you had.

1276
01:01:30,217 --> 01:01:34,012
It’s a thing, is a matter of your right to have it.

1277
01:01:34,019 --> 01:01:36,642
It’s your right to have that power

1278
01:01:36,653 --> 01:01:39,554
but you have to ask for it.

1279
01:01:39,614 --> 01:01:42,333
If you don’t ask for it, I cannot force it on you.

1280
01:01:42,384 --> 01:01:44,333
Nobody can force it on you.

1281
01:01:44,393 --> 01:01:46,335
It is a very spontaneous happening

1282
01:01:46,414 --> 01:01:51,224
and it works out, so fast, so fast.

1283
01:01:51,224 --> 01:01:53,277
I must tell you in Russia,

1284
01:01:53,284 --> 01:01:55,994
this hall of course has fallen short

1285
01:01:56,054 --> 01:02:01,382
but in Russia you always have it in big-big huge places

1286
01:02:01,391 --> 01:02:04,391
with sixteen thousand, eighteen thousand

1287
01:02:04,472 --> 01:02:08,061
and they are so much

1288
01:02:08,141 --> 01:02:10,748
I don’t know, endowed with shraddha,

1289
01:02:10,739 --> 01:02:13,898
so much that in the program only they get it.

1290
01:02:13,898 --> 01:02:17,518
Only in the program! I could not understand.

1291
01:02:17,528 --> 01:02:20,289
And they had a meeting of the scientists there,

1292
01:02:20,309 --> 01:02:23,037
about two hundred and fifty scientists came.

1293
01:02:23,057 --> 01:02:25,838
So, I started telling them about science to begin with.

1294
01:02:25,907 --> 01:02:29,157
I said better be on their level at least to talk to them.

1295
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:32,186
So, one of them got up and said,

1296
01:02:32,202 --> 01:02:35,177
“Mother, don’t tell us about this science, we know everything.

1297
01:02:35,197 --> 01:02:37,657
Now, you tell us the science of God,

1298
01:02:37,637 --> 01:02:38,577
science of Divine.

1299
01:02:38,579 --> 01:02:39,786
You tell us about this.”

1300
01:02:39,789 --> 01:02:42,528
I was amazed, look at these Russians!

1301
01:02:42,608 --> 01:02:45,148
So, I found out all these countries

1302
01:02:45,159 --> 01:02:49,444
like Bulgaria, Russia, Romania and all these five countries,

1303
01:02:49,449 --> 01:02:52,444
there the people are like clean slates,

1304
01:02:52,432 --> 01:02:54,242
they have no conditioning,

1305
01:02:54,313 --> 01:02:55,753
they don’t know anything about God,

1306
01:02:55,813 --> 01:02:58,693
they don’t know anything about books, nothing.

1307
01:02:58,742 --> 01:03:00,623
Absolutely, they are not conditioned

1308
01:03:00,612 --> 01:03:02,933
and the way they have achieved this Sahaja Yoga

1309
01:03:02,916 --> 01:03:05,074
I have been really amazed at this.

1310
01:03:05,135 --> 01:03:09,547
Romania I was amazed and I just told them,

1311
01:03:09,565 --> 01:03:14,407
one paper I read – not read, I never read – I told them about one thing

1312
01:03:14,427 --> 01:03:17,894
and the medical, same thing like this, was there

1313
01:03:17,914 --> 01:03:20,364
and they gave me a Doctorate,

1314
01:03:20,385 --> 01:03:24,065
not honorary but real Doctorate, on that knowledge.

1315
01:03:24,061 --> 01:03:25,074
Can you imagine?

1316
01:03:25,050 --> 01:03:27,425
I mean it’s not possible.

1317
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,096
First, I didn’t know, I have never known these things,

1318
01:03:30,090 --> 01:03:33,016
so one of my disciples, “Mother, you have become a Doctor!”

1319
01:03:33,021 --> 01:03:35,425
I said, “That I think I have, already.”

1320
01:03:35,443 --> 01:03:37,864
“No, no this is a real Doctorate, real.”

1321
01:03:37,914 --> 01:03:40,101
I said, “Really, how they have done?”

1322
01:03:40,103 --> 01:03:41,762
Such sensitive people

1323
01:03:41,762 --> 01:03:44,041
but this sensitivity comes

1324
01:03:44,043 --> 01:03:47,851
perhaps may be that they were very much oppressed and troubled

1325
01:03:47,880 --> 01:03:52,302
and also, they had no conditioning of anything.

1326
01:03:52,289 --> 01:03:56,373
And it’s very surprising they have no sense of possessiveness.

1327
01:03:56,385 --> 01:03:59,635
Their Government said, “You take your own flats and look after.”

1328
01:03:59,655 --> 01:04:03,335
So, they said, “No, no, no we don’t want. You look after.”

1329
01:04:03,346 --> 01:04:05,766
They said, “All right whatever cars you have given, you take them.”

1330
01:04:05,835 --> 01:04:08,428
“No, no, no, no. What a headache. You better look after.

1331
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:10,293
What is the use of taking them?

1332
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:13,668
Because after all when we die it will be left here.”

1333
01:04:13,702 --> 01:04:16,158
So, such unconditioned minds

1334
01:04:16,188 --> 01:04:18,258
and such clean slates I tell you!

1335
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:21,451
In the same way we are also very much,

1336
01:04:21,447 --> 01:04:24,171
Indians are very much capable,

1337
01:04:24,197 --> 01:04:27,421
very much more capable than they are.

1338
01:04:27,411 --> 01:04:28,911
Once they get it, they get it

1339
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:31,210
and they can go very deep into it

1340
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,800
because our life is very deep.

1341
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:36,960
Our, culture is very deep.

1342
01:04:37,050 --> 01:04:40,340
We have had thanks to all the Saints and all the Sufis

1343
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:48,480
and all the incarnations that basically our genes are very good.

1344
01:04:48,501 --> 01:04:52,080
But with Sahaja Yoga you can even change the genes,

1345
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:53,440
we have shown you.

1346
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:56,879
You can change the genes also in Sahaja Yoga.

1347
01:04:56,879 --> 01:05:00,039
And we should not accept anybody because he says,

1348
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:04,273
“His genes are bad, so he should be allowed to be what he is.”

1349
01:05:04,344 --> 01:05:05,563
It’s not that.

1350
01:05:05,634 --> 01:05:09,543
Everything changeable and to say that genes are

1351
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:13,769
just the cause of your own style,

1352
01:05:13,766 --> 01:05:15,150
it’s not so.

1353
01:05:15,155 --> 01:05:18,059
Because one child will have different genes,

1354
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,050
another child will have another genes

1355
01:05:20,070 --> 01:05:21,820
So how can that be?

1356
01:05:21,820 --> 01:05:23,550
So, it’s not from the parents,

1357
01:05:23,550 --> 01:05:25,510
it’s not from anything,

1358
01:05:25,539 --> 01:05:32,778
circumstances but it is with your own reactions to things that you develop genes.

1359
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,428
So, what happens with genes is that

1360
01:05:36,448 --> 01:05:41,192
you become a very, very religious man,

1361
01:05:41,282 --> 01:05:44,815
very religious in the real sense

1362
01:05:44,784 --> 01:05:49,445
Not religion because you pray too much nothing but inside,

1363
01:05:49,465 --> 01:05:51,365
inside you are so religious.

1364
01:05:51,385 --> 01:05:53,611
And religion is what is love,

1365
01:05:53,635 --> 01:05:56,865
love for humanity is religion

1366
01:05:56,876 --> 01:05:58,846
and that becomes so innate

1367
01:05:58,856 --> 01:06:01,456
and so in born and you enjoy.

1368
01:06:01,485 --> 01:06:02,815
you see loving people.

1369
01:06:02,806 --> 01:06:05,318
You enjoy giving your love to others.

1370
01:06:05,335 --> 01:06:07,588
Even those who hate you,

1371
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,438
you love to give them love

1372
01:06:10,454 --> 01:06:14,454
because you think hatred after all is due to ignorance,

1373
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:18,336
is not because he hates you really but ignorance.

1374
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:21,996
And you start seeing the whole thing in a very different vision.

1375
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:25,400
So, I have a great vision of our country

1376
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:30,178
achieving that en masse emancipation,

1377
01:06:30,190 --> 01:06:33,418
awakening and so let the whole world come here.

1378
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:37,351
Once, they came just to give us slavery.

1379
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:41,921
Now, let them come here to learn what is Divine.

1380
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,851
And you all can do it very well.

1381
01:06:43,862 --> 01:06:45,481
You don’t have to read many books,

1382
01:06:45,481 --> 01:06:46,631
nothing of the kind.

1383
01:06:46,641 --> 01:06:48,302
We don’t give also books to people

1384
01:06:48,362 --> 01:06:49,851
because if you give them books

1385
01:06:49,922 --> 01:06:52,986
they will just become masters of the books

1386
01:06:52,986 --> 01:06:56,300
and will not achieve anything they should go deep down

1387
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:59,362
First of all, they should be themselves

1388
01:06:59,362 --> 01:07:01,682
completely one with the Divine.

1389
01:07:01,679 --> 01:07:03,741
Otherwise they are not entitled,

1390
01:07:03,755 --> 01:07:05,655
they have no powers.

1391
01:07:05,704 --> 01:07:08,781
When you are not empowered, how will you do the job?

1392
01:07:08,784 --> 01:07:11,561
But for that you don’t have to spend too much time,

1393
01:07:11,594 --> 01:07:14,155
five minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening.

1394
01:07:14,215 --> 01:07:16,158
If you can meditate nothing like it

1395
01:07:16,161 --> 01:07:17,820
and you will be surprised

1396
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,650
that all your thought process will slow down

1397
01:07:20,681 --> 01:07:24,010
so much so that you can see clearly

1398
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:27,949
what is right, what is wrong.

1399
01:07:27,960 --> 01:07:30,139
What’s going wrong with you also

1400
01:07:30,199 --> 01:07:31,730
because you get self-knowledge.

1401
01:07:31,789 --> 01:07:33,639
And also, with others

1402
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:36,550
because you develop a new dimension

1403
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:40,340
which we call as collective consciousness,

1404
01:07:40,360 --> 01:07:42,380
Samuhik Chaitanya,

1405
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:44,000
collective consciousness.

1406
01:07:44,081 --> 01:07:47,965
Sitting down here you can feel the vibrations of Mr. Clinton.

1407
01:07:48,025 --> 01:07:51,954
or you can feel the vibrations of any person anywhere,

1408
01:07:51,974 --> 01:07:53,513
sitting down here.

1409
01:07:53,545 --> 01:07:56,414
Now if you know how to correct these vibrations,

1410
01:07:56,405 --> 01:07:57,853
your own vibrations,

1411
01:07:57,873 --> 01:08:00,355
you can correct the vibrations of others.

1412
01:08:00,425 --> 01:08:03,996
You can correct the vibrations sitting down here

1413
01:08:04,028 --> 01:08:05,996
of other people who are far away.

1414
01:08:05,989 --> 01:08:08,829
But of course, you can also correct the vibrations

1415
01:08:08,878 --> 01:08:11,396
of people who are with you.

1416
01:08:11,426 --> 01:08:13,856
In your family there are people who are mad,

1417
01:08:13,909 --> 01:08:15,296
You can correct them.

1418
01:08:15,318 --> 01:08:17,460
So, we can have very good families

1419
01:08:17,469 --> 01:08:19,720
and we could have very good marriages.

1420
01:08:19,738 --> 01:08:21,680
It has many dimensions Sahaja Yoga

1421
01:08:21,708 --> 01:08:25,623
but today is the day I want to really thank you all

1422
01:08:25,684 --> 01:08:29,573
the medical science people, and the industrialists,

1423
01:08:29,573 --> 01:08:32,222
that they should now take to Sahaja Yoga

1424
01:08:32,283 --> 01:08:34,659
and make the best of their lives,

1425
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:38,619
lives which are brought in this great country of Yoga

1426
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:40,750
where you can easily achieve.

1427
01:08:40,819 --> 01:08:43,829
In this country, it is so full of vibrations,

1428
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:46,556
so full of vibrations, you won’t believe.

1429
01:08:46,636 --> 01:08:48,917
I was coming from London with my husband,

1430
01:08:48,987 --> 01:08:51,029
and I told him, “We have touched India.”

1431
01:08:51,037 --> 01:08:53,859
He said, “How do you know?” I said, “See the vibrations all around.

1432
01:08:53,867 --> 01:08:55,909
It’s only in India you feel these vibrations.”

1433
01:08:55,917 --> 01:08:58,159
So, he went to the pilot just to find out.

1434
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:01,818
He said, “Sir, only a minute back we touched India.”

1435
01:09:01,837 --> 01:09:04,559
So, this is such a great country you have.

1436
01:09:09,048 --> 01:09:11,544
And if we could just develop that feeling

1437
01:09:11,548 --> 01:09:13,514
that we are Indians

1438
01:09:13,548 --> 01:09:16,018
and it is our responsibility

1439
01:09:16,048 --> 01:09:19,008
to see that our knowledge goes all over

1440
01:09:19,048 --> 01:09:21,192
and let people take advantage of it.

1441
01:09:21,282 --> 01:09:23,221
By that we don’t criticise anyone.

1442
01:09:23,311 --> 01:09:25,742
By that we don’t condemn anybody, as I have told you,

1443
01:09:25,811 --> 01:09:30,803
but we give them the basis of all the knowledge,

1444
01:09:30,823 --> 01:09:36,083
and that, in Sahaja Yoga, you can do it very well.

1445
01:09:36,123 --> 01:09:38,821
I would say that instead of reading the book

1446
01:09:38,837 --> 01:09:41,051
better get your Realisation

1447
01:09:41,059 --> 01:09:42,559
because Kabira himself has said it,

1448
01:09:42,628 --> 01:09:45,691
“Padhi Padhi pundit murakh bhayo,

1449
01:09:45,731 --> 01:09:49,971
pundit bhayo na koye, dhai akshar prem ka,

1450
01:09:50,051 --> 01:09:52,311
seekhe to pundit hoye.”

1451
01:09:52,335 --> 01:09:55,435
Even after studying all books and scriptures a scholar becomes a fool, nobody becomes a scholar.

1452
01:09:55,435 --> 01:09:58,615
Whoever learns two and a half words of love, he becomes a scholar.

1453
01:09:58,634 --> 01:10:00,756
Thank you very much.
