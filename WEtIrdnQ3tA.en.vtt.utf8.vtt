00:38:16.959 --> 00:38:18.834
[NO SOUND UP TO HERE]

00:38:26.709 --> 00:38:30.625
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.166
I asked them to play this music,

00:38:42.417 --> 00:38:48.375
because the thoughts were too much

00:38:49.083 --> 00:38:51.375
[in the minds?]

00:38:57.083 --> 00:38:59.792
And this music has no words,

00:38:59.999 --> 00:39:02.250
it doesn't give you thoughts.

00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:12.375
And that's how thoughts can be removed very easily.

00:39:19.583 --> 00:39:23.542
One thought rises and falls off.

00:39:24.291 --> 00:39:27.875
Another thought rises and falls off.

00:39:28.166 --> 00:39:33.417
And we are jumping on the cusp of the thought.

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:49.999
Either we are thinking about the past or about the future.

00:39:55.417 --> 00:40:00.000
But we cannot be in the present.

00:40:05.250 --> 00:40:09.417
When one thought rises and falls off,

00:40:09.625 --> 00:40:11.208
and before another rises,

00:40:11.417 --> 00:40:16.208
there is a space in between and that is the present.

00:40:26.125 --> 00:40:29.667
So when this Kundalini rises,

00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:34.709
it makes this thought smaller.

00:40:40.542 --> 00:40:46.291
And this central area of silence expands.

00:40:51.542 --> 00:40:56.875
That is the time we become thoughtlessly aware.

00:41:02.125 --> 00:41:04.917
When we look at a beautiful carpet,

00:41:05.083 --> 00:41:08.917
all kinds of thoughts start coming in our head.

00:41:15.250 --> 00:41:20.667
If this is my carpet, then I am worried about the insurance.

00:41:25.375 --> 00:41:28.208
But if it is somebody else's carpet,

00:41:28.417 --> 00:41:32.000
then I start thinking, where will I get such a beautiful carpet,

00:41:32.333 --> 00:41:34.625
how much I'll have to pay?

00:41:43.083 --> 00:41:48.625
I cannot enjoy the creation of beauty and joy,

00:41:48.875 --> 00:41:53.208
that the artist has tried to pour into it.

00:42:00.709 --> 00:42:03.375
So when I see this carpet,

00:42:03.583 --> 00:42:06.625
and I am in thoughtless awareness,

00:42:06.875 --> 00:42:13.041
all the joy of it's creation starts flowing, like a river Ganges,

00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:18.250
cool vibrations start flowing and you feel completely relaxed.

00:42:30.208 --> 00:42:37.166
So the first step we have to do in Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:37.375 --> 00:42:41.458
is to establish our thoughtless awareness.

00:42:49.375 --> 00:42:55.834
It can be done, if we understand this center of Agnya.

00:43:01.834 --> 00:43:05.291
It is placed between the two optic chasms crossing,

00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:07.750
like this.

00:43:12.417 --> 00:43:17.583
And when the Kundalini pierces through it,

00:43:17.792 --> 00:43:22.834
the Deity in that center is awakened.

00:43:32.834 --> 00:43:37.999
This is the Deity of our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:43:42.458 --> 00:43:50.625
First he is conceptualized by the Divine,

00:43:50.875 --> 00:43:54.208
in the first Chakra of Mooladhara.

00:44:00.125 --> 00:44:05.041
So he is the Deity of innocence,

00:44:08.291 --> 00:44:11.125
which incarnates on this earth.

00:44:13.999 --> 00:44:19.041
Not only this, but it is the body of Christ

00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:22.291
was made of vibrations.

00:44:28.959 --> 00:44:32.083
That is why he could walk on the water.

00:44:35.917 --> 00:44:38.291
He has told a very simple thing,

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:42.875
that we have to forgive others,

00:44:43.083 --> 00:44:46.333
as God has to forgive us.

00:44:54.250 --> 00:44:58.125
As soon as you forgive others,

00:44:58.458 --> 00:45:00.417
and ask for forgiveness,

00:45:00.625 --> 00:45:03.375
this center opens.

00:45:09.917 --> 00:45:13.500
And then Christ is awakened,

00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:16.542
is born within you, or can say awakened,

00:45:16.750 --> 00:45:19.583
and he sucks in these two institutions

00:45:19.792 --> 00:45:24.417
of ego and your conditioning, which is called as superego.

00:45:37.500 --> 00:45:42.291
So these two institutions are sucked in

00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:48.834
and the brain opens out like a lotus.

00:45:57.083 --> 00:45:59.999
Inside is the limbic area.

00:46:03.875 --> 00:46:09.625
And the Kundalini then passes through your fontanel-bone-area.

00:46:14.667 --> 00:46:17.750
But the most important thing is,

00:46:17.959 --> 00:46:21.625
first this center has to be completely opened out.

00:46:28.458 --> 00:46:30.792
Then the question one gentleman has asked,

00:46:30.999 --> 00:46:35.166
that are the sufferings due to our Kharmas?

00:46:41.250 --> 00:46:46.125
Only the human beings think, that they are doing some Kharmas.

00:46:49.792 --> 00:46:52.083
Animals never think that way.

00:46:54.166 --> 00:46:56.750
Because we have our ego,

00:46:56.959 --> 00:47:00.500
That's why we think, we have done wright or wrong.

00:47:07.500 --> 00:47:11.667
A tiger will kill any animal and eat it.

00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.999
A serpent can just bite anyone.

00:47:26.041 --> 00:47:30.083
But they don't think they have done anything wrong or wright.

00:47:35.333 --> 00:47:36.792
But human beings think,

00:47:36.999 --> 00:47:41.667
that we have done this wrong and this wright.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:50.750
But, actually, they do not know, what is wright and wrong.

00:47:55.417 --> 00:47:58.083
Because they live in relative world.

00:48:00.667 --> 00:48:04.792
For somebody this is wright, for somebody that is wright.

00:48:08.834 --> 00:48:11.959
But what is the absolute?

00:48:14.250 --> 00:48:16.333
What is the absolute truth?

00:48:18.458 --> 00:48:20.333
That only you can know,

00:48:20.542 --> 00:48:24.583
when you have these divine vibrations,

00:48:29.291 --> 00:48:33.542
and you become the divine computer.

00:48:36.875 --> 00:48:40.709
Then everybody, who has got this awareness,

00:48:40.917 --> 00:48:42.458
thinks the same way.

00:48:47.333 --> 00:48:52.083
They just know, what is wright and what is wrong.

00:48:55.625 --> 00:48:59.250
Like, if there is a dirty lane,

00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:04.250
a tiger, or a dog, all can pass through it.

00:49:10.542 --> 00:49:13.750
But human beings can not pass.

00:49:16.458 --> 00:49:18.625
They will all get the same dirty smell,

00:49:18.834 --> 00:49:21.750
and they won't be able to go through that dirt.

00:49:25.999 --> 00:49:30.166
But when you become a saint,

00:49:30.959 --> 00:49:36.792
then you know, what is wright and what is wrong.

00:49:41.709 --> 00:49:45.208
And you cannot do anything that is wrong.

00:49:47.959 --> 00:49:50.834
Because you get this new dimension,

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:56.166
by which you know, that this we cannot have, this is wrong.

00:50:02.875 --> 00:50:06.667
But before that, before that fully happens,

00:50:06.959 --> 00:50:11.000
you have your conditionings and your ego.

00:50:16.917 --> 00:50:21.291
That covers you and you become a closed personality,

00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.375
like an egg.

00:50:28.250 --> 00:50:31.542
So the opening of this

00:50:32.208 --> 00:50:36.875
has to be done by the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:50:37.083 --> 00:50:41.500
but also at this center, Agnya-center,

00:50:41.709 --> 00:50:44.250
when Christ is awakened,

00:50:44.458 --> 00:50:47.667
he sucks in your ego, your Kharmas,

00:50:47.875 --> 00:50:50.709
and he sucks in your conditionings.

00:51:03.375 --> 00:51:06.041
That's what he said, that we say,

00:51:06.250 --> 00:51:10.417
that Christ died for our sins.

00:51:11.583 --> 00:51:14.709
That's what we say, that Christ died for our sins.

00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.333
Because when he is awakened,

00:51:22.542 --> 00:51:27.291
by his own powers he can suck in all our sins.

00:51:33.917 --> 00:51:36.667
So you don't have to go on [harping?],

00:51:36.875 --> 00:51:40.542
that I have done bad Kharmas, I have done bad Kharmas.

00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:49.625
You need not feel guilty at all.

00:51:52.291 --> 00:51:58.875
because Christ has done this duty for us, of resurrection,

00:51:59.041 --> 00:52:04.166
and because of him all our Kharmas are going to be sucked in.

00:52:11.999 --> 00:52:13.917
He has suffered for us.

00:52:15.792 --> 00:52:18.625
So we don't have to suffer any more.

00:52:20.709 --> 00:52:24.792
This idea of suffering has come from people,

00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.625
who just like people to suffer.

00:52:33.709 --> 00:52:38.959
They want you not to enjoy the beauty of Gods love.

00:52:45.250 --> 00:52:47.375
They will say, you are sinners,

00:52:47.583 --> 00:52:49.208
so you must pay money,

00:52:49.417 --> 00:52:53.917
and when you pay money, all your sins will be finished.

00:53:02.125 --> 00:53:04.625
But God does not understand money.

00:53:07.667 --> 00:53:09.750
He doesn't know banking.

00:53:11.291 --> 00:53:13.625
It's all your headache.

00:53:15.834 --> 00:53:20.375
So all such ideas are given, that we must suffer,

00:53:20.583 --> 00:53:23.375
and we should starve, we should stand on our heads,

00:53:23.583 --> 00:53:26.750
and we should give all the money to these people,

00:53:26.959 --> 00:53:29.458
who are telling us, we are sinners.

00:53:38.417 --> 00:53:42.333
Are we going to suffer more, then what Christ has suffered?

00:53:47.041 --> 00:53:51.834
In Sistine-Chapel I saw Michelangelo has made

00:53:52.333 --> 00:53:56.792
such a huge beautiful Sistine-Chapel,

00:53:56.999 --> 00:54:01.250
with a Christ with such a healthy body standing there.

00:54:07.333 --> 00:54:10.959
Because Michelangelo was a realized soul.

00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.417
And below that was a table,

00:54:17.625 --> 00:54:20.750
on which something, called Christ, was kept,

00:54:20.959 --> 00:54:24.542
with bones and skin on top.

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:34.125
So miserable, like a tuberculoses-patient.

00:54:37.625 --> 00:54:41.458
Can a patient like that carry a big cross?

00:54:45.417 --> 00:54:47.208
Think about it!

00:54:48.709 --> 00:54:55.291
Now, thank God, Thomas, the disciple of Christ,

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.375
has written all about Christ,

00:54:57.583 --> 00:55:02.166
and it was stored in Egypt, on his way to India.

00:55:03.083 --> 00:55:07.291
Thomas has written everything about Christ,

00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:09.625
and has stored it in Egypt.

00:55:17.500 --> 00:55:20.417
And it has been [decoded?]

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:23.291
and after forty-eight years

00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:24.750
we have come to know,

00:55:24.959 --> 00:55:29.375
that Thomas has talked about nothing but Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:38.166 --> 00:55:44.041
He says, that our father, God,

00:55:44.250 --> 00:55:48.458
is the father of all the fathers.

00:55:48.667 --> 00:55:51.834
And he is so kind,

00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.917
he is so loving,

00:55:54.083 --> 00:55:58.625
how can he ask you to suffer for him?

00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:14.125
He has said, that you have to have the experience of self-knowledge,

00:56:14.333 --> 00:56:16.166
and then you will realize,

00:56:16.375 --> 00:56:21.000
that our father is just anxiously waiting us,

00:56:21.208 --> 00:56:24.959
for us to enter into the kingdom of God.

00:56:29.500 --> 00:56:31.875
Now, you see, that he has said it,

00:56:32.041 --> 00:56:36.083
that our father is waiting in the kingdom of God for us,

00:56:36.291 --> 00:56:38.166
to enter into it.

00:56:50.041 --> 00:56:52.709
So let us be joyous and happy.

00:56:55.166 --> 00:56:58.000
And give up the idea of sufferings.

00:57:02.417 --> 00:57:05.625
We have to have the self knowledge, that's all.

00:57:09.417 --> 00:57:12.417
You are not to feel sad or guilty.

00:57:16.291 --> 00:57:21.291
This is what is the message of Thomas about Christ.

00:57:26.291 --> 00:57:28.542
So thinking creates,

00:57:28.750 --> 00:57:31.917
as he, the gentleman, has asked me about diabetes,

00:57:32.083 --> 00:57:35.041
that can it be cured of thirty years of diabetes?

00:57:35.250 --> 00:57:37.875
It can be very easily.

00:57:44.959 --> 00:57:49.542
The diabetes is caused by over-thinking.

00:57:52.917 --> 00:57:54.999
Because the second center that we have,

00:57:55.166 --> 00:58:00.625
the yellow one, which moves round the green void,

00:58:00.834 --> 00:58:03.750
is the one by which, ah ...

00:58:04.542 --> 00:58:10.291
When we think, the grey cells are transformed into ...

00:58:10.500 --> 00:58:12.375
When we use our grey cells,

00:58:12.583 --> 00:58:19.417
we get more grey celles, by the activity of this particular center,

00:58:19.625 --> 00:58:21.709
called as Swadisthana.

00:58:33.542 --> 00:58:38.583
So it converts the fat-celles into the grey cells,

00:58:38.792 --> 00:58:42.417
for the use of the brain, when we think too much.

00:58:48.417 --> 00:58:52.458
Now, if you think too much,

00:58:52.667 --> 00:58:56.041
then this poor center has to do only one job,

00:58:56.250 --> 00:58:57.999
is to convert the fat-celles

00:58:58.166 --> 00:59:02.834
into the grey cells for the brain.

00:59:11.166 --> 00:59:13.667
But it has many other things to be done.

00:59:16.166 --> 00:59:19.417
And it has to look after the liver.

00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:21.792
It has to look after the pancreas.

00:59:21.999 --> 00:59:23.875
It has to look after the spleen.

00:59:24.041 --> 00:59:26.125
It has to look after the intestines.

00:59:26.333 --> 00:59:29.625
And also it has to look after the kidney.

00:59:39.709 --> 00:59:41.750
But when you think too much,

00:59:41.959 --> 00:59:45.000
all these organs are neglected.

00:59:49.250 --> 00:59:51.834
Now in India, in the villages,

00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:53.542
when they take sugar,

00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:57.667
the villagers must have the spoon standing at right angel

00:59:57.875 --> 00:59:59.999
in the sugar ...

01:00:05.999 --> 01:00:07.875
... in the cup.

01:00:08.041 --> 01:00:12.792
Now, they drink so much of sugar, nobody gets diabetes.

01:00:16.834 --> 01:00:19.166
Because they don't think.

01:00:23.166 --> 01:00:27.125
They earn, they earn for one day,

01:00:27.333 --> 01:00:28.875
and sleep off nicely,

01:00:29.041 --> 01:00:32.417
they don't have to take sleeping-pills.

01:00:38.125 --> 01:00:40.750
But it is very difficult to stop thinking,

01:00:40.959 --> 01:00:43.458
once your brain is modern.

01:00:48.375 --> 01:00:50.458
Like one doctor in Switzerland said,

01:00:50.667 --> 01:00:52.959
Mother you cut my throught, or do what you like,

01:00:53.125 --> 01:00:55.375
but stop this thinking.

01:01:04.041 --> 01:01:09.875
So this thinking itself is responsible for diabetes.

01:01:10.041 --> 01:01:12.458
And the gentleman who has diabetes,

01:01:12.667 --> 01:01:15.041
if he practises Sahaja Yoga,

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:19.208
his thinking will be under his control.

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.375
If he wants to think, he can think.

01:01:31.583 --> 01:01:35.333
Or if he doesn't want to think, he need not think.

01:01:40.709 --> 01:01:43.917
Even when too many thoughts are bombarding you,

01:01:44.125 --> 01:01:49.125
if he just say, I forgive, I forgive, I forgive, three times,

01:01:49.333 --> 01:01:54.709
you will find that this center will be quite at ease,

01:01:54.959 --> 01:01:57.667
and you won't have problems.

01:02:07.875 --> 01:02:11.709
Yesterday you saw, so many people did not feel the cool breeze.

01:02:11.917 --> 01:02:14.667
and when I said, now forgive, forgive, forgive, three times,

01:02:14.917 --> 01:02:17.417
they started feeling the vibrations.

01:02:30.417 --> 01:02:32.834
And one lady said, she cannot forgive,

01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:35.750
it is very difficult, she cannot forgive.

01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:44.458
Because of that her, this center had become so [jumped?],

01:02:44.667 --> 01:02:48.125
because it could not get out anything from here.

01:02:53.625 --> 01:02:59.709
So, as you saw, yesterday I gave two jets to her Vishuddhi,

01:02:59.917 --> 01:03:04.083
and she started feeling the vibrations all right.

01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:08.834
Two jets I gave her.

01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:21.458
So in the modern times, I think, there are two centers,

01:03:21.667 --> 01:03:24.875
which are very much blocked.

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:33.166
One of them is this Chakra of Vishuddhi.

01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:39.000
And another is of Agnya.

01:03:41.083 --> 01:03:45.625
And this Vishuddhi Chakra is for collectivity.

01:03:48.875 --> 01:03:50.959
Is for communication.

01:03:52.625 --> 01:03:55.250
For example, when we have to wish somebody,

01:03:55.458 --> 01:03:57.750
we shake the hands.

01:04:01.375 --> 01:04:04.792
Because of my another life, with my husband,

01:04:04.999 --> 01:04:09.583
sometimes I have to shake hands, with 700 people at a time.

01:04:18.041 --> 01:04:19.542
Only when they are going in,

01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:21.792
but when they are coming out, they are drunk.

01:04:21.999 --> 01:04:23.875
So you don't know, what they do to your hand,

01:04:24.041 --> 01:04:26.625
completely finish it off.

01:04:36.417 --> 01:04:39.999
So this hand, which God has given us,

01:04:40.166 --> 01:04:42.208
gives you communication.

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:49.750
And also gives, tells you, there is communication with the divine.

01:04:49.959 --> 01:04:54.041
because you start feeling the cool breeze, on your fingertips.

01:05:01.208 --> 01:05:02.709
Now, the doctors have agreed,

01:05:02.917 --> 01:05:08.999
that these are the nerve endings of the sympathetic nervous system.

01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:19.792
And so we have five, six and seven centers

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:23.875
on the left-hand side and seven centers on the right-hand side.

01:05:29.333 --> 01:05:34.250
Now when left and right side meet, a center is formed like this.

01:05:39.083 --> 01:05:42.750
And inside is the part of our ascent,

01:05:43.083 --> 01:05:45.083
is a third channel.

01:05:50.667 --> 01:05:54.291
So this is the left sympathetic, this is the right sympathetic.

01:05:58.208 --> 01:05:59.750
When ever we use in emergency,

01:05:59.959 --> 01:06:04.208
these two sympathetics, what happens sometimes, they go like that.

01:06:09.875 --> 01:06:13.625
And sometimes, with some sort of a shock, it breaks.

01:06:16.667 --> 01:06:19.792
Then the relation with the whole is lost.

01:06:22.917 --> 01:06:25.625
And the cells start growing on their own,

01:06:25.834 --> 01:06:29.542
we call it, it is then a malignancy, cancer.

01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:39.208
So to cure the cancer, if the Kundalini rises,

01:06:39.417 --> 01:06:43.041
what you have to do, is to push this like that.

01:06:50.083 --> 01:06:52.250
Yesterday there was a lady with cancer,

01:06:52.458 --> 01:06:55.500
and also with multiple sclerosis.

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:03.208
So what I did, I put a candle before me,

01:07:03.417 --> 01:07:06.959
and asked he, to put her left hand towards the candle.

01:07:14.417 --> 01:07:17.291
Now, by putting left hand to the candle,

01:07:17.500 --> 01:07:20.375
you see, my vibrations were passing

01:07:20.583 --> 01:07:22.667
through this light, which was enlightened

01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:26.625
and was passing through the hand, from the left side,

01:07:26.834 --> 01:07:32.917
and by that this one, that was broken, got fitted like that.

01:07:40.458 --> 01:07:44.208
And within ten minutes the [bold?] felt all right.

01:07:47.208 --> 01:07:50.041
There is no miracle, it is scientific.

01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.875
Absolutely scientific.

01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.417
Only, science can go up to a point.

01:08:01.917 --> 01:08:04.875
Whatever they see is the science.

01:08:07.959 --> 01:08:10.333
They cannot go beyond.

01:08:12.125 --> 01:08:15.583
So they use only human awareness.

01:08:18.667 --> 01:08:21.500
But if you use your superhuman awareness,

01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:23.792
you have all the knowledge.

01:08:29.083 --> 01:08:31.375
And if you work it out,

01:08:31.583 --> 01:08:34.542
if you work it out, you will be amazed,

01:08:34.750 --> 01:08:41.417
how one candle can cure ten cancer patients.

01:08:48.083 --> 01:08:51.709
Then they say, Mother we should give you some money.

01:08:51.917 --> 01:08:55.667
How much will you pay for a candle?

01:09:02.417 --> 01:09:04.417
How can you pay for that?

01:09:06.583 --> 01:09:09.625
So this is how it is so simple.

01:09:12.291 --> 01:09:14.834
When you go to the basics and the fundamentals,

01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:18.125
everything is very simple.

01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:28.125
Now, I must say, Sahaja Yoga has also cured Aids.

01:09:31.625 --> 01:09:33.792
But those people who get Aids,

01:09:33.999 --> 01:09:36.417
have no will-power to live.

01:09:41.750 --> 01:09:46.250
Those people whom we cured, again went to the dirty habits.

01:09:52.041 --> 01:09:54.750
So they again got it.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.333
Like this, there are many diseases, which can be easily cured,

01:10:04.542 --> 01:10:07.875
if you know, from which side the problem is coming.

01:10:08.041 --> 01:10:11.083
Is it coming from the left, or from the right?

01:10:18.125 --> 01:10:21.875
If somebody says, how many turns there are?

01:10:22.083 --> 01:10:25.750
Only left and right, that's all. Two turns.

01:10:32.583 --> 01:10:35.500
So if you can cure your left, or right,

01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:37.750
you are in the center.

01:10:42.875 --> 01:10:46.500
That is why Sahaja Yoga is the simplest method

01:10:46.709 --> 01:10:51.291
of curing many diseases, which are incurable.

01:10:57.875 --> 01:11:01.917
The left side diseases that comes to us

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:06.125
can be called as psychic, and the right side somatic.

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:15.625
So the combination of these two

01:11:15.834 --> 01:11:18.250
also there are diseases which are psycho-somatic,

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:20.625
they also can be cured.

01:11:26.375 --> 01:11:31.875
So even in this modern times, where we really do crazy things,

01:11:32.083 --> 01:11:36.792
it doesn't matter, you can be balanced and you can be all right.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:47.583
In Sahaja Yoga you feel so satisfied, so happy,

01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:52.250
all the time so joyous, and so generous,

01:11:52.625 --> 01:11:56.834
that you do not feel the greed,

01:11:57.041 --> 01:11:59.500
the bangs of the greed.

01:12:07.250 --> 01:12:09.999
In that you want to give.

01:12:12.667 --> 01:12:16.250
Like this light, which is first not enlightened,

01:12:16.500 --> 01:12:20.542
must be waiting for the light, to come inside it.

01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:25.208
When this light is not enlightened,

01:12:25.417 --> 01:12:29.000
then it is waiting for the, to be enlightened.

01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:38.291
But once it is enlightened, it is giving light.

01:12:41.875 --> 01:12:45.625
So once you are asking for light, you are sitting like this,

01:12:45.875 --> 01:12:49.542
and once you get the light, you give lights to others.

01:12:55.709 --> 01:12:58.583
Thus you start clearefying yourself completely,

01:12:58.792 --> 01:13:01.709
the purity starts coming within you.

01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:07.083
Your eyes become innocent.

01:13:09.041 --> 01:13:11.250
Your heart becomes pure.

01:13:13.041 --> 01:13:16.208
And you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy them.

01:13:18.458 --> 01:13:20.667
And you enjoy others.

01:13:21.834 --> 01:13:25.709
Those who have got realization, you enjoy their company.

01:13:30.208 --> 01:13:32.583
You enjoy your marriages, you enjoy your children,

01:13:32.792 --> 01:13:35.458
you enjoy your family.

01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:43.583
You enjoy your friends, you enjoy Sahaja Yogis,

01:13:43.792 --> 01:13:45.333
everyone you enjoy.

01:13:45.542 --> 01:13:50.250
There is no jealousy, there is no competition, nothing of that kind.

01:13:56.917 --> 01:14:01.583
Such friendship, that I tell you, is so joy giving.

01:14:01.999 --> 01:14:04.333
When I see a jew,

01:14:04.542 --> 01:14:10.792
holding a muslim Sahaja Yogi with such joy,

01:14:11.166 --> 01:14:13.917
embracing fully.

01:14:24.917 --> 01:14:29.041
All these barriers, which are so false, drop out.

01:14:33.125 --> 01:14:38.166
That is how one race of higher-awareness people comes up.

01:14:38.458 --> 01:14:39.875
and this transformation

01:14:40.041 --> 01:14:43.542
makes them forget all these nonsensical things.

01:14:51.792 --> 01:14:55.959
We have to all become the spirit,

01:14:58.542 --> 01:15:02.333
which is the reflection of God Almighty,

01:15:07.291 --> 01:15:10.750
which is the source of peace and joy.

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:19.417
Is the source of all the knowledge, which is pure knowledge.

01:15:23.083 --> 01:15:26.999
And when the light of the spirit comes in your attention,

01:15:27.166 --> 01:15:30.709
your attention becomes pure.

01:15:38.083 --> 01:15:42.417
There is no lust and greed, but pure love.

01:15:47.709 --> 01:15:53.166
If such a person even puts a glance towards you,

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:56.875
then you feel the peace,

01:15:57.041 --> 01:15:59.291
you can feel the Kundalini rising,

01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.875
you can get completely cured.

01:16:12.709 --> 01:16:15.709
And about all, spiritually we become one

01:16:15.917 --> 01:16:19.542
with that great ocean of divine power.

01:16:25.458 --> 01:16:29.542
And from very small incitents to very big incitents

01:16:29.792 --> 01:16:34.959
you will be amazed, that you feel, all the time, there is protection

01:16:41.959 --> 01:16:47.250
and complete guidance and help every moment.

01:16:50.792 --> 01:16:52.792
First you think it is coincidence,

01:16:52.999 --> 01:16:55.041
but later on every moment,

01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:58.417
when you find there is something is happening to help you,

01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:01.083
then you'll understand, that it is something.

01:17:01.291 --> 01:17:04.000
We are in the kingdom of God.

01:17:13.625 --> 01:17:19.166
Everyone of you have right to enter into the kingdom of God.

01:17:23.792 --> 01:17:26.542
So please don't feel guilty.

01:17:28.959 --> 01:17:31.959
And forgive everyone. That's all.

01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:39.667
And you'll be surprised, how suddenly you will find yourself

01:17:39.917 --> 01:17:43.041
into that state of thoughtless awareness.

01:17:48.625 --> 01:17:52.834
And than, after some time,

01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:55.999
you'll become doubtlessly aware.

01:18:00.417 --> 01:18:04.250
You have no doubts about yourself, that you are a realized soul,

01:18:04.458 --> 01:18:09.041
and you have no doubts about others, that they are realized souls.

01:18:16.500 --> 01:18:19.542
You have complete confidence about it.

01:18:22.417 --> 01:18:26.458
It is such a powerful, dynamic compassion.

01:18:31.250 --> 01:18:35.291
So let us have our realization now.

01:18:38.583 --> 01:18:41.917
It will take about ten minutes

01:18:42.291 --> 01:18:47.417
and I am sure all of you will be helped very much.

01:18:55.166 --> 01:18:57.917
If you all put your shoes on one side

01:18:58.208 --> 01:19:02.458
and put both feet on the ground, separated.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:17.667
Those who want to come, can come also in front, to sit down.

01:19:17.875 --> 01:19:21.458
It's better the lady has gone there, ask her to sit here,

01:19:21.667 --> 01:19:23.000
come, not on the sides.

01:19:23.208 --> 01:19:26.250
You won't be able to see me. You come here?

01:19:32.959 --> 01:19:36.458
These are all Sahaja Yogis, it's all right.

01:19:37.166 --> 01:19:40.000
Those who want to come can come and sit in front.

01:20:00.083 --> 01:20:03.125
There is - come in, come in - there is space here.

01:20:04.208 --> 01:20:07.875
Next time you must take a bigger hall.

01:20:22.625 --> 01:20:26.125
Can you full this up there, so, it [would be?] better.

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:29.333
Can you pull this chair, my chair there?

01:20:29.583 --> 01:20:32.166
This chair.
