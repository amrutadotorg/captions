00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.034
﻿Diwali Puja. Moscow (Russia), 12 November 1993.

00:15:47.556 --> 00:15:53.989
It is so very gratifying to see

00:15:54.189 --> 00:16:01.819
so many people from all over the world have come to Russia

00:16:02.019 --> 00:16:06.819
to worship the Goddess Lakshmi.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:31.718
When you cannot explain everything intellectually,

00:16:31.918 --> 00:16:40.218
then you take course to arts to express yourself.

00:16:52.018 --> 00:16:57.502
And then you take to symbols to express

00:16:57.702 --> 00:17:05.038
what you cannot say verbally or cannot express rationally.

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:21.567
This is what an artist does, also a poet does

00:17:21.767 --> 00:17:27.901
that he extends his imagination

00:17:28.101 --> 00:17:34.054
to such an extent that he creates a symbol.

00:17:45.607 --> 00:17:52.927
But this mind is limited and it can only go up to a point

00:17:58.274 --> 00:18:03.660
and when it is not substantiated by truth and reality,

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.201
after some time, it falls.

00:18:06.401 --> 00:18:12.105
The whole linear movement falls down and there is a decline.

00:18:22.982 --> 00:18:27.715
That is what we find in every area today,

00:18:27.915 --> 00:18:34.923
specially that everything which was sublime has declined.

00:18:47.625 --> 00:18:56.713
This decline takes place and people start accepting it.

00:19:05.573 --> 00:19:11.564
But after Self Realization, when you have become the Spirit,

00:19:11.764 --> 00:19:16.639
your imagination touches the reality.

00:19:24.298 --> 00:19:27.234
Then the symbols which were perverted,

00:19:27.434 --> 00:19:33.465
which was misrepresented, drop out.

00:19:41.108 --> 00:19:49.588
And you touch the reality of the symbols.

00:19:55.017 --> 00:20:01.364
This is exactly what has happened everywhere.

00:20:06.583 --> 00:20:16.976
For example, we had in India the Goddess of wealth as Lakshmi,

00:20:23.916 --> 00:20:27.045
and this symbol of Lakshmi

00:20:27.245 --> 00:20:33.419
was described by saints and seers in reality.

00:20:39.313 --> 00:20:45.128
But later on people did not understand

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:50.300
the symbol and the reality behind it.

00:20:56.987 --> 00:21:04.794
And they thought that the symbol of Lakshmi is money,

00:21:08.063 --> 00:21:15.040
is wealth, gold, silver, diamonds, riches.

00:21:19.261 --> 00:21:24.066
And they started worshipping money.

00:21:27.511 --> 00:21:33.877
That is how the symbol of wealth,

00:21:34.077 --> 00:21:39.212
Goddess the Lakshmi, was perverted.

00:21:44.001 --> 00:21:48.375
People don’t understand that when they have money,

00:21:48.575 --> 00:21:53.504
why they start doing wrong things.

00:21:57.762 --> 00:22:04.698
Even in India, nowadays people are so perverted

00:22:04.898 --> 00:22:11.185
that if you give hundred rupees to a poor man, he will go to a pub.

00:22:11.385 --> 00:22:15.071
To a pub.

00:22:23.411 --> 00:22:29.880
He will only think of self-indulgence, and not of others,

00:22:34.529 --> 00:22:41.888
not his family, not his children, not his country, but himself.

00:22:48.860 --> 00:22:53.378
But the symbol of Lakshmi is very different.

00:22:56.870 --> 00:23:04.572
Firstly the one who has Lakshmi has to be a mother,

00:23:04.772 --> 00:23:12.116
like a mother, must have the love of a mother who loves her children.

00:23:19.455 --> 00:23:22.798
She has to be a woman

00:23:22.998 --> 00:23:30.733
and woman stands for something very sublime.

00:23:37.451 --> 00:23:40.884
Mother is the source of all the energies,

00:23:41.084 --> 00:23:46.225
but she has patience,

00:23:50.021 --> 00:23:55.420
and she has love, compassion.

00:23:57.248 --> 00:24:00.996
So a man who has money cannot be happy

00:24:01.196 --> 00:24:04.175
unless and until he is compassionate.

00:24:04.375 --> 00:24:10.011
He uses this money for giving it to others.

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:22.465
But what has happened today in the countries which are supposed to be affluent?

00:24:22.666 --> 00:24:30.611
They have gone all out to destroy themselves with the money that they have.

00:24:41.131 --> 00:24:46.509
Also they have used money to express their anger,

00:24:46.709 --> 00:24:52.157
and their lust, their greed.

00:24:58.657 --> 00:25:02.663
Also they have wasted their money in trying to show off

00:25:02.863 --> 00:25:08.394
that they are something very individualistic.

00:25:15.101 --> 00:25:21.885
Like in America, went there and I met a very rich man.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.787
And when I got to his car, he told Me that,

00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:36.068
"My handles of the door open the other way around."

00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:48.605
So I said, "Why? What is the use of this kind of a thing?

00:25:48.805 --> 00:25:54.183
Anybody can get locked up in your car."

00:25:59.284 --> 00:26:03.522
So he said, "It is my individuality, is my genius, you see,

00:26:03.722 --> 00:26:08.935
which has created this something not so common."

00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.270
And then I went into his house, he told,

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:23.965
"You be careful this bathroom is very special."

00:26:30.090 --> 00:26:32.260
And then he said, "If you press this button,

00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:37.593
you will just jump into the swimming pool."

00:26:43.191 --> 00:26:48.581
I said, "I don’t want to go into this bathroom."

00:26:53.976 --> 00:26:56.760
And then he took Me to his bed and he said,

00:26:56.960 --> 00:27:01.018
"This bed is special if you press this button, your legs will go up,

00:27:01.218 --> 00:27:06.480
if you press this button, your head will go up."

00:27:14.741 --> 00:27:17.299
I said, "I don’t want to do these acrobats the whole night,

00:27:17.499 --> 00:27:21.968
I’ll sleep on the ground."

00:27:27.103 --> 00:27:31.135
So...

00:27:35.833 --> 00:27:40.500
Now the Eastern block people sometimes think that Americans,

00:27:40.700 --> 00:27:44.785
or the Europeans, or the people who are so called affluent

00:27:44.985 --> 00:27:49.625
are very happy people.

00:27:56.370 --> 00:28:00.472
They are not because they have no wisdom.

00:28:02.631 --> 00:28:09.686
They go on wasting money like this, they are bankrupt, good for nothing.

00:28:15.017 --> 00:28:17.450
One day they’ll be moving in a Rolls-Royce,

00:28:17.650 --> 00:28:22.298
tomorrow they’ll be on the street begging.

00:28:27.723 --> 00:28:32.590
Because there is no Lakshmi in them, it’s just money.

00:28:38.069 --> 00:28:40.682
So the symbol of Lakshmi you should try to understand,

00:28:40.882 --> 00:28:44.228
is very important.

00:28:47.885 --> 00:28:54.508
Because if the Lakshmi resides in your Nabhi

00:28:54.708 --> 00:29:00.367
and if She is satisfied, then only the Mahalakshmi principle rises,

00:29:00.567 --> 00:29:05.570
means then you start seeing beyond.

00:29:20.393 --> 00:29:23.356
Now these people had so much money

00:29:23.556 --> 00:29:25.692
that they didn’t know what to do and they thought

00:29:25.892 --> 00:29:31.111
now this not sufficient, we have to seek further.

00:29:38.884 --> 00:29:43.808
Then they took to drugs and all kinds of things.

00:29:48.996 --> 00:29:53.221
If you find anybody in England or America,

00:29:53.421 --> 00:29:59.440
any place with torn clothes, know that he is a rich man.

00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:04.080
With torn clothes is a rich man.

00:30:12.807 --> 00:30:20.740
This is the condition of perversion where everything is perverted.

00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:36.991
Now the Lakshmi principle is like this,

00:30:37.191 --> 00:30:40.874
that as I said, She is a Mother.

00:30:41.074 --> 00:30:44.221
She is a Mother.

00:30:44.421 --> 00:30:49.577
In two hands... What is it? Sit down.

00:30:56.177 --> 00:31:03.036
In two hands, She has got pink lotuses.

00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:13.608
Now the pink lotus means

00:31:13.808 --> 00:31:21.428
a flower which is come out of the pond

00:31:21.628 --> 00:31:30.210
and allows even a thorny insect to come inside it.

00:31:40.799 --> 00:31:44.984
That means a rich man, or a man with Lakshmi,

00:31:45.184 --> 00:31:51.656
must have a house, or a whole household, or a estate

00:31:51.856 --> 00:31:57.573
which is very beautiful like the lotus, pink in color,

00:31:57.773 --> 00:32:05.291
means inviting, welcoming everyone, all kinds of guests.

00:32:18.654 --> 00:32:23.042
Now this insect with all the thorns in it comes in

00:32:23.242 --> 00:32:29.206
and sleeps on the corona of that lotus very beautifully

00:32:29.406 --> 00:32:35.862
and in the night the lotus covers it, so it doesn’t feel the cold.

00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:58.481
So the man with the money, or man with the wealth,

00:32:58.681 --> 00:33:05.723
is not a Lakshmi Pati, he is not the one who has the blessings of the Lakshmi.

00:33:12.317 --> 00:33:16.854
But the man with wisdom and who has money,

00:33:17.054 --> 00:33:23.156
we can call has got the blessings of the Lakshmi.

00:33:31.018 --> 00:33:39.226
So like the lotus is so hospitable, so anxious to get guests

00:33:39.427 --> 00:33:44.904
in his own being and to look after.

00:33:54.578 --> 00:33:59.842
In the same way a person who has money,

00:34:00.042 --> 00:34:03.615
who is supposed to be blessed by Lakshmi

00:34:03.815 --> 00:34:12.748
should be the same hospitable, of the same hospitable personality.

00:34:19.134 --> 00:34:24.363
But the surprising thing is all those nations today

00:34:24.563 --> 00:34:30.808
who look to be affluent have been parasites.

00:34:37.538 --> 00:34:42.790
They looted all the countries.

00:34:42.991 --> 00:34:46.919
They formed empires.

00:34:47.119 --> 00:34:51.098
They formed empires.

00:34:51.298 --> 00:34:56.067
Like in India now as you know we had for three hundred years

00:34:56.267 --> 00:35:02.246
the English, the British three hundred years as our guests.

00:35:07.734 --> 00:35:12.299
Without any visa, without any immigration, they came.

00:35:12.499 --> 00:35:17.474
Without any visa, without any immigration.

00:35:19.661 --> 00:35:26.645
But now if an Indian has to go to England, is impossible situation.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:35.589
And those who go there also are treated

00:35:35.789 --> 00:35:43.902
not on the same level as they treat their own people.

00:35:53.733 --> 00:35:57.271
Same with America.

00:35:57.471 --> 00:35:59.748
Thank God Columbus was coming to India

00:35:59.948 --> 00:36:06.784
and I think Shri Hanumana took him down to America, thank God.

00:36:16.529 --> 00:36:24.649
Otherwise all the Indians would have been finished and I would not have been here.

00:36:28.737 --> 00:36:32.483
They killed all the Indians there, all the Indians

00:36:32.683 --> 00:36:38.709
and took away all their lands, all their lands.

00:36:39.310 --> 00:36:46.287
They took away all their lands and all the indians...

00:36:49.688 --> 00:36:53.930
And now they are supposed to be rich.

00:36:55.290 --> 00:37:01.832
And the sins they have committed have to come back on them, isn’t it.

00:37:06.082 --> 00:37:10.023
And you can’t go to America easily

00:37:10.224 --> 00:37:14.335
as if that is their own land.

00:37:21.009 --> 00:37:26.056
All of them do not belong to that land.

00:37:30.856 --> 00:37:36.359
Then we can see about the people who think they are higher races

00:37:36.559 --> 00:37:41.078
because they can make more money.

00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:50.439
I mean they have killed people in gas chambers, did all kinds of things.

00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:56.019
How are they higher race? I can’t understand.

00:38:01.334 --> 00:38:06.584
Is that the sign of being higher?

00:38:09.689 --> 00:38:17.270
For us if Christ is the symbol of higher personality,

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:22.630
then what were His qualities?

00:38:25.762 --> 00:38:31.844
He was the noblest man you could think of,

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:36.405
Noblest man you could think of.

00:38:39.214 --> 00:38:46.792
The greatest personality as far as morals are concerned.

00:38:47.841 --> 00:38:51.549
Greatest personality as far as morals are concerned.

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:54.078
You seat here, I think it looks better.

00:38:54.279 --> 00:38:57.433
Better, better here.

00:38:57.633 --> 00:39:05.926
Greatest personality as far as morality is concerned.

00:39:07.778 --> 00:39:15.859
And such forgiveness, such magnanimity, such glory.

00:39:22.050 --> 00:39:27.979
He would, was the One who was blessed with Lakshmi.

00:39:32.701 --> 00:39:36.821
He was a satisfied soul.

00:39:37.021 --> 00:39:40.368
He would not do anything wrong, whatever money you might give Him.

00:39:40.568 --> 00:39:45.318
Nobody could purchase Him.

00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:53.223
So after coming to Sahaja Yoga is important to know

00:39:53.423 --> 00:39:58.263
that you are blessed by Lakshmi.

00:40:03.751 --> 00:40:08.531
With the one hand She gives,

00:40:08.731 --> 00:40:15.998
She gives to others, that is Her nature, to give.

00:40:18.529 --> 00:40:22.048
Like if one door is open the air won’t come in.

00:40:22.248 --> 00:40:28.149
But if you open the other door, then only it will circulate.

00:40:35.766 --> 00:40:41.964
So to be satisfied is one of the qualities of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:40:44.995 --> 00:40:51.655
Some of them do ask for money miracles.

00:40:55.507 --> 00:41:02.106
That’s not the way your attitude should be.

00:41:02.306 --> 00:41:06.106
You are now the Spirits.

00:41:06.306 --> 00:41:10.162
And the Spirit doesn’t care for the comfort of body, mind,

00:41:10.362 --> 00:41:16.145
but for the comfort of the Spirit.

00:41:21.554 --> 00:41:26.320
Many of you have become Spirits, no doubt.

00:41:28.627 --> 00:41:37.174
But you are not aware, some of you, of your own status.

00:41:40.334 --> 00:41:45.701
You have to be aware about it.

00:41:49.048 --> 00:41:54.009
With the other hand She gives protection.

00:41:56.446 --> 00:42:02.067
Protection to all those who worship Her.

00:42:04.528 --> 00:42:08.523
All those who work for Her.

00:42:10.507 --> 00:42:15.003
So anybody who has money has to give protection to people

00:42:15.203 --> 00:42:22.026
who are employed by him or working for him.

00:42:30.130 --> 00:42:35.116
We have now transcended into an area

00:42:35.317 --> 00:42:42.164
where you have no fundamentalism in your head.

00:42:49.332 --> 00:42:54.976
But you worship all the, all the great incarnations,

00:42:55.176 --> 00:43:02.843
all the great seers and all the prophets.

00:43:08.595 --> 00:43:12.963
Most of them did not have any money,

00:43:14.504 --> 00:43:18.289
but they were blessed by Lakshmi,

00:43:18.489 --> 00:43:23.702
because they were satisfied soul.

00:43:23.902 --> 00:43:30.280
So this is the quality of a Lakshmi that She should satisfy.

00:43:33.967 --> 00:43:42.366
You know that in economics desires are not satiable in general.

00:43:46.509 --> 00:43:52.259
So what is the desire which is satiable?

00:43:55.278 --> 00:44:03.073
Is the pure desire, which is the Kundalini.

00:44:03.273 --> 00:44:06.487
When you are absolutely satisfied and you know that

00:44:06.687 --> 00:44:10.276
there is no sense in hankering after money, power

00:44:10.476 --> 00:44:14.646
and all nonsensical things,

00:44:20.432 --> 00:44:26.505
then the Mahalakshmi principle is awakened within you.

00:44:29.981 --> 00:44:36.258
And this Mahalakshmi principle gives you seeking.

00:44:40.047 --> 00:44:45.551
Then you become a special category of people

00:44:45.752 --> 00:44:51.698
whom William Blake has described as men of God.

00:44:56.154 --> 00:45:01.524
Then you don’t have these conditionings of your childhood,

00:45:01.724 --> 00:45:05.355
of your nationality, of your so-called outside religion,

00:45:05.555 --> 00:45:09.202
no conditioning.

00:45:15.410 --> 00:45:24.663
But you rise higher and you become the Spirit.

00:45:27.741 --> 00:45:34.970
That is the time when you understand the Lakshmi principle within you.

00:45:38.755 --> 00:45:46.958
The Lakshmi principle is that you enjoy doing for others.

00:45:52.531 --> 00:45:57.807
In collective consciousness, you want to do for others.

00:46:02.237 --> 00:46:08.084
If you are still worried about yourself only,

00:46:10.052 --> 00:46:13.002
about your own comfort, about your own earnings,

00:46:13.202 --> 00:46:18.961
about your own glory,

00:46:23.665 --> 00:46:27.527
then you go into imbalance.

00:46:29.511 --> 00:46:34.763
Lakshmi is standing on a lotus, completely balanced.

00:46:38.420 --> 00:46:43.642
Moreover She doesn’t assert,

00:46:43.842 --> 00:46:47.614
just standing on a lotus, She doesn’t assert Her power,

00:46:47.814 --> 00:46:53.743
that She is money or She is the Goddess of money.

00:47:01.653 --> 00:47:06.981
She is absolutely contented with Herself.

00:47:09.508 --> 00:47:13.081
If you are not contented that means you don’t know yourself.

00:47:13.281 --> 00:47:17.984
You are yet a half baked Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:24.596 --> 00:47:31.552
A Sahaja Yogi is a person who is absolutely contented within himself.

00:47:36.763 --> 00:47:46.602
Because his self, his Spirit is the source of all the absolute knowledge.

00:47:51.042 --> 00:47:56.324
Is the source of enlightenment for your attention.

00:47:58.834 --> 00:48:02.850
And is the source of joy.

00:48:04.201 --> 00:48:09.118
Joy is not happiness and unhappiness,

00:48:12.712 --> 00:48:17.356
which depends on ego,

00:48:17.556 --> 00:48:22.285
but it is absolute.

00:48:23.199 --> 00:48:30.457
So such fun, after Realization you feel

00:48:35.215 --> 00:48:43.082
that you don’t care for money, you don’t care for anything.

00:48:46.079 --> 00:48:52.047
If you have it, well and good, if you don’t have it, well and good.

00:48:55.519 --> 00:49:00.577
You are completely detached.

00:49:00.777 --> 00:49:05.759
Lastly, I’ll tell you a story of Raja Janaka,

00:49:05.959 --> 00:49:12.662
who was the father of Shri Sita, who was the wife of Shri Rama.

00:49:17.267 --> 00:49:21.962
He must have existed six thousand years back

00:49:26.145 --> 00:49:30.624
and He was a king.

00:49:30.824 --> 00:49:33.922
So He had to wear all the ornaments,

00:49:34.122 --> 00:49:38.898
and all the dresses that a king had to wear.

00:49:44.750 --> 00:49:50.190
But all the saints of those days used to touch His feet.

00:49:55.010 --> 00:49:57.977
So one disciple of one guru said,

00:49:58.177 --> 00:50:01.634
"Why do you touch His feet after all He lives like a king,

00:50:01.834 --> 00:50:05.891
and dresses up like a king?"

00:50:13.789 --> 00:50:17.436
So he said, "You have no idea as to what He is.

00:50:17.636 --> 00:50:23.658
If He has mercy on you, He might give you Self Realization."

00:50:33.968 --> 00:50:39.722
So this disciple Nachiketa went to the king and said that,

00:50:39.922 --> 00:50:45.190
"Sir, I have come to get my Self Realization."

00:50:49.857 --> 00:50:55.568
He said, "I’m sorry, I can’t give you Self Realization, I am sorry.

00:50:58.649 --> 00:51:02.363
You can take all my property, everything,

00:51:02.563 --> 00:51:06.730
but I cannot give you Self Realization.

00:51:11.495 --> 00:51:19.896
Because yet you haven’t got that personality."

00:51:27.201 --> 00:51:33.146
So Nachiketa was disappointed and he said,

00:51:33.346 --> 00:51:40.396
"All right, Sir, I’ll wait till you are ready to test me

00:51:40.596 --> 00:51:45.575
and see if I could get Realization."

00:51:57.008 --> 00:52:04.534
So He said, "All right, let’s go and have a bath in the river."

00:52:08.245 --> 00:52:10.545
When they were having a bath,

00:52:10.745 --> 00:52:16.345
the people from the palace came and told Him, the king,

00:52:16.545 --> 00:52:21.264
that, "Sir, your palace is on fire."

00:52:31.001 --> 00:52:35.193
Still He was meditating.

00:52:36.622 --> 00:52:39.032
Then again they came and said, "Now all the people

00:52:39.232 --> 00:52:45.594
are running away from there, all your relations, all your family."

00:52:51.133 --> 00:52:53.944
Still they were meditating, He was meditating,

00:52:54.144 --> 00:52:59.542
and this Nachiketa was looking at Him.

00:53:03.326 --> 00:53:05.845
Then they said, "All the fire is coming here,

00:53:06.045 --> 00:53:10.178
now all your clothes will be burnt."

00:53:11.411 --> 00:53:13.602
they said that "All the fire is coming this side

00:53:13.802 --> 00:53:19.654
and all the clothes will be burnt, your clothes."

00:53:24.512 --> 00:53:27.960
Still He was meditating.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:33.296
But Nachiketa ran out and he picked up his clothes.

00:53:37.085 --> 00:53:40.670
Then he realized "How detached this man is

00:53:40.871 --> 00:53:46.658
about His money, about His wealth,

00:53:50.604 --> 00:53:53.742
about His family.

00:53:53.942 --> 00:53:59.700
And look at me, I’m worried about these small things like this."

00:54:03.075 --> 00:54:08.562
"He has to dress up like that because He is a king."

00:54:12.039 --> 00:54:18.823
So he surrendered himself to Him and he got his Realization.

00:54:25.404 --> 00:54:31.587
In those days, it was very difficult to get Self Realization,

00:54:31.787 --> 00:54:36.032
even to give Self Realization.

00:54:40.532 --> 00:54:45.214
But these are special time, the blossom time.

00:54:47.074 --> 00:54:50.175
They call it the Last Judgment, you can call it

00:54:50.383 --> 00:54:52.933
the Resurrection Time, you can call it the Qiyamah,

00:54:53.134 --> 00:54:56.469
as they call it in Koran.

00:55:06.760 --> 00:55:10.365
It is said that people will come out of their graves

00:55:10.565 --> 00:55:12.982
and will get their resurrection. I mean what is left to the graves

00:55:13.182 --> 00:55:18.747
is nothing but a few stones and a few bones.

00:55:25.133 --> 00:55:30.698
No. All these souls which are dead will take their birth,

00:55:30.898 --> 00:55:38.175
take human body and take their Realization in these special times.

00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:53.165
This is a sensible thing to say.

00:55:53.365 --> 00:55:57.368
And is also happening.

00:55:58.688 --> 00:56:02.027
So now you have got your Realization

00:56:02.227 --> 00:56:05.967
because of your good deeds you did in last previous lives,

00:56:06.167 --> 00:56:10.574
as we say purva punyas.

00:56:17.639 --> 00:56:21.376
But you must respect It and you must understand

00:56:21.576 --> 00:56:25.569
what you have got is so great.

00:56:29.384 --> 00:56:34.660
You have to know you are the Spirit now.

00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:37.601
You are special people.

00:56:37.801 --> 00:56:41.062
You are going to solve the problems of your country,

00:56:41.262 --> 00:56:46.437
of your community, of your society, of your families.

00:56:51.867 --> 00:56:57.225
You’ll be solving the problem of the whole world.

00:56:57.425 --> 00:57:02.159
You are the one who are going to bring peace on this earth.

00:57:04.065 --> 00:57:11.795
You are the one who are going to create a new world of beautiful divine people.

00:57:16.532 --> 00:57:19.761
So have faith in yourself.

00:57:19.961 --> 00:57:24.019
This faith works very fast.

00:57:24.219 --> 00:57:28.644
Because not a false faith, is a fact.

00:57:30.503 --> 00:57:33.756
And grow in Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:33.956 --> 00:57:38.108
Don’t be a dwarf.

00:57:41.639 --> 00:57:46.400
I am happy to see the collectivity now in the Eastern block

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.301
and also Russia,

00:57:51.501 --> 00:57:56.556
other countries which are here today.

00:58:04.473 --> 00:58:09.725
So now you are asking for the blessings of the Lakshmi.

00:58:12.233 --> 00:58:17.650
So the first thing you should ask is the satisfaction.

00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:24.525
Then the generosity.

00:58:24.726 --> 00:58:27.555
A person who has the blessings of Lakshmi cannot be miserly,

00:58:27.755 --> 00:58:31.544
cannot be.

00:58:34.583 --> 00:58:40.454
He is, he is a diseased person.

00:58:40.654 --> 00:58:45.303
Trying to save money here, trying to save money there.

00:58:47.681 --> 00:58:55.635
This doesn’t exist in the mind of a person who is evolved.

00:59:00.958 --> 00:59:04.773
I am very happy I could come to Russia

00:59:04.973 --> 00:59:11.104
and that at this juncture will be able to create the atmosphere

00:59:11.304 --> 00:59:16.140
which is very good for your country.

00:59:24.417 --> 00:59:27.584
And all other people who have come from other countries

00:59:27.784 --> 00:59:33.417
also will carry this atmosphere to their own countries.

00:59:40.935 --> 00:59:46.945
Now you know that you have no karmas left.

00:59:50.406 --> 00:59:54.365
It’s all finished.

00:59:54.565 --> 01:00:00.612
And now you are beautiful, new people.

01:00:03.990 --> 01:00:09.310
The blossoming time has brought you as fruits now.

01:00:14.134 --> 01:00:17.122
So don’t pay attention to yourself, to your maladies,

01:00:17.322 --> 01:00:20.923
to your troubles.

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:29.563
And things will improve, things will improve definitely.

01:00:32.548 --> 01:00:37.701
Somebody was telling Me they have got pain in the knee.

01:00:40.108 --> 01:00:43.202
I just felt I get so many times pain in the knee.

01:00:43.402 --> 01:00:47.915
I have pain here, because I absorb from you.

01:00:53.504 --> 01:00:58.241
But I never think about it.

01:00:58.441 --> 01:01:02.265
I never bother.

01:01:02.465 --> 01:01:06.671
Because I see My body, all right.

01:01:09.287 --> 01:01:12.366
Like this machine if it is spoiled, we should cure it,

01:01:12.567 --> 01:01:15.326
finished.

01:01:18.822 --> 01:01:21.864
But all the time if you are thinking, "This is paining here,

01:01:22.064 --> 01:01:24.122
this is wrong, I haven’t got money,

01:01:24.323 --> 01:01:28.801
I’ve got to do this business, that business", finished.

01:01:35.888 --> 01:01:45.664
So now we have to rise into the realm of super-consciousness.

01:01:51.015 --> 01:02:00.894
I can go on speaking about everything which is so sublime, so beautiful.

01:02:07.615 --> 01:02:11.927
There are many lectures which I have given.

01:02:13.336 --> 01:02:17.961
But lectures are nothing but words.

01:02:20.016 --> 01:02:23.941
These are the web of words.

01:02:25.753 --> 01:02:29.350
So you must get out of it.

01:02:29.550 --> 01:02:34.440
You have to go beyond the mind.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:40.148
That’s what is My own vision.

01:02:42.421 --> 01:02:46.908
And so many have fulfilled it.

01:02:50.213 --> 01:02:54.154
I am always yours whenever you want.

01:02:54.355 --> 01:02:59.131
Whenever you want Me to come, I will come.

01:03:02.634 --> 01:03:07.298
That My love is more than My own will.

01:03:12.064 --> 01:03:17.598
But you also must love yourself and love your Self-realization.

01:03:21.348 --> 01:03:25.804
May God bless you.

01:03:29.335 --> 01:03:34.321
There is one thing we have to know that in the Nabhi resides the Lakshmi,

01:03:34.522 --> 01:03:37.750
and you have reached the state where She is a reality within you.

01:03:37.951 --> 01:03:41.856
She is not a symbol anymore.

01:03:48.780 --> 01:03:52.729
So today after the puja,

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:56.932
this Lakshmi principles must be awakened within you

01:03:57.132 --> 01:04:06.955
and should spread all its light in the Nabhi centre.

01:04:20.031 --> 01:04:25.679
May God bless you.

01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:33.870
All have become Nirvicharya.

01:04:36.182 --> 01:04:41.724
So first of all we worship Shri Ganesha.

01:04:44.818 --> 01:04:51.789
He’s the symbol, for you is the reality of innocence,

01:04:54.055 --> 01:04:59.329
of purity, of wisdom.

01:05:00.011 --> 01:05:07.425
So He was the One first created before the whole universe was created.

01:05:12.944 --> 01:05:18.158
So first we’ll worship Shri Ganesha. The children will do that worship,

01:05:18.358 --> 01:05:24.502
because they are the symbol of that innocence.
