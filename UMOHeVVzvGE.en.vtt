00:33:41.510 --> 00:33:48.158
I wanted to be with you people
on a Christmas day,

00:33:48.527 --> 00:33:52.071
but it never happened before.

00:33:52.271 --> 00:33:58.232
It has so chanced that I have to be here
with you today and on the New Year.

00:33:58.433 --> 00:34:01.404
Something good has to happen
I hope next year,

00:34:01.605 --> 00:34:05.308
some good luck has to come.

00:34:09.535 --> 00:34:17.419
Christ’s work was very unique. The whole
thing was a very unique thing,

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:24.755
was planned in such a manner that
He was to be born

00:34:24.956 --> 00:34:31.482
in a place which was very humble,
very humble place.

00:34:31.683 --> 00:34:37.529
Because He came to teach us humility.

00:34:37.729 --> 00:34:45.604
The word ‘teaching’ in English language
means telling about it, talking about it.

00:34:47.291 --> 00:34:57.388
But when I say ‘teach’ I mean create,
to activate this humility.

00:34:57.589 --> 00:35:04.377
Actually He came on this earth
first of all

00:35:06.338 --> 00:35:12.502
to create a space within us,
at the Agnya chakra,

00:35:13.819 --> 00:35:21.245
by removing the hurdles of the ego,
hurdles of the ego.

00:35:23.729 --> 00:35:27.845
He had to talk of humility that time,

00:35:28.045 --> 00:35:33.467
because Romans were ruling and they
were very arrogant,

00:35:33.667 --> 00:35:42.683
very crude, uncouth, underdeveloped,
we should say, not at all evolved.

00:35:42.905 --> 00:35:50.738
Like, you can say some of the animals,
which came into being

00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:56.066
and were thrown out of the evolutionary
process later on because they were useless,

00:35:56.267 --> 00:36:04.138
too aggressive or too big for their size
or some sort of a thing like that.

00:36:04.338 --> 00:36:07.541
In the same way Romans were.

00:36:08.885 --> 00:36:14.540
If you see their body, even now,
painted sometimes,

00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:18.705
you’ll find that it was not like
a human body, it was like

00:36:18.906 --> 00:36:22.459
some animals you see, the muscles
and all that was very grotesque.

00:36:22.659 --> 00:36:30.103
There was no softness, no roundishness,
on their faces.

00:36:30.435 --> 00:36:37.702
So, this ego of Romans affected everyone
whom they ruled

00:36:37.902 --> 00:36:43.416
because when you have somebody
as an ideal before you,

00:36:43.616 --> 00:36:51.392
and always people see who dominates them,
and then such a person becomes their ideal.

00:36:51.592 --> 00:36:57.957
So you start imbibing that kind
of a character within yourself.

00:36:58.158 --> 00:37:03.011
You see, somebody who is condescending,
you also become suddenly condescending.

00:37:03.211 --> 00:37:06.645
You see somebody who is very egoistical
and tries to show off,

00:37:06.846 --> 00:37:12.387
you also put up air. You can see this
everyday happening,

00:37:12.588 --> 00:37:20.174
that a boss comes in who is a very,
very airy person,

00:37:20.375 --> 00:37:23.655
everybody in the office is like that.

00:37:24.970 --> 00:37:28.181
And that’s how Romans affected the people
in those days

00:37:28.381 --> 00:37:31.185
by creating their own ideals, people
thought they are the ideals,

00:37:31.386 --> 00:37:39.338
they are the best, because they had
produced results according to them.

00:37:39.896 --> 00:37:43.967
They were so powerful, they thought
this was the power.

00:37:44.167 --> 00:37:49.738
And that’s why they followed their methods,
many people who were not even Romans.

00:37:49.938 --> 00:37:55.260
The another humbler group was
affected because

00:37:55.460 --> 00:37:59.031
they were hurt, their ego was hurt.

00:37:59.231 --> 00:38:03.330
So they became equally violent

00:38:03.531 --> 00:38:08.504
in the sense that they were so touchy
that you could not say anything to them,

00:38:08.705 --> 00:38:14.642
they would just come and bark on you,
frightened people.

00:38:16.369 --> 00:38:21.734
This kind of character is very dangerous
also,

00:38:21.996 --> 00:38:27.073
because that gives you some sort of very
bad diseases: can give you leprosy,

00:38:27.273 --> 00:38:30.065
people develop leprosy with that kind
of character,

00:38:30.265 --> 00:38:32.688
if you develop a barking temperament

00:38:32.888 --> 00:38:37.217
of a nature by which you just jump
at people.

00:38:37.417 --> 00:38:43.809
Nerves become absolutely
sort of shattered by it,

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:49.440
and the leprosy is the disease
of the nerves.

00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:55.695
Those people who always keep themselves
under such strain

00:38:56.155 --> 00:38:58.843
and jump at every person who comes
along

00:38:59.043 --> 00:39:03.859
are very dangerously placed as far
as their nerves are concerned.

00:39:06.975 --> 00:39:12.625
And then a horrible type of virus
you know that which creates leprosy

00:39:12.826 --> 00:39:18.297
attacks these nerves, can attack because
they are very vulnerable,

00:39:18.498 --> 00:39:22.200
these kind of people who jump
on the others.

00:39:22.402 --> 00:39:25.238
That’s why there was so much leprosy,
in that small little place

00:39:25.439 --> 00:39:31.625
there were so many lepers, because
their nerves were shattered.

00:39:36.161 --> 00:39:39.226
In those circumstances Christ was born.

00:39:39.426 --> 00:39:43.080
But He was not only born just for Romans
or for anyone,

00:39:43.281 --> 00:39:46.056
but He was born for the whole world.

00:39:46.256 --> 00:39:51.588
Because ego had started growing in human
beings at that time

00:39:51.789 --> 00:39:57.093
and had developed quite a lot as far
as the Romans were concerned.

00:39:57.531 --> 00:40:03.425
And that demarcated the way human
beings were going on.

00:40:03.626 --> 00:40:10.095
So they had to be controlled first of all,

00:40:10.296 --> 00:40:13.993
and Christ had to come at a time where

00:40:14.194 --> 00:40:19.824
a balance between ego and superego
was to be established.

00:40:23.452 --> 00:40:25.749
So the first thing that was said
about Christ throughout

00:40:25.950 --> 00:40:32.703
in all these music and songs you have
heard now is that ‘Peace on Earth.’

00:40:35.562 --> 00:40:40.054
He came to create peace on earth.

00:40:41.733 --> 00:40:47.700
That’s only possible when you are
in balance, first of all,

00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:51.671
secondly when you are Realized.

00:40:51.872 --> 00:40:55.322
Both things should be there. If only you
get your Realization

00:40:55.523 --> 00:41:00.703
and there is no balance in you,
there cannot be peace.

00:41:01.289 --> 00:41:09.552
But peace never means in any way,
is a personality that recedes back,

00:41:09.752 --> 00:41:14.285
runs away from situations,
escapist,

00:41:14.485 --> 00:41:19.660
who does not want to face the reality -
never means that.

00:41:20.133 --> 00:41:27.375
Christ is pictured very differently
from what He was.

00:41:28.003 --> 00:41:31.253
He was the healthiest personality
you could think of,

00:41:31.456 --> 00:41:35.842
and the humblest man you could
think of.

00:41:36.043 --> 00:41:42.117
And He would not stand any nonsense,
nobody could take liberties with Him.

00:41:42.318 --> 00:41:46.753
But He would not Himself take liberties
with others, of course no question.

00:41:46.953 --> 00:41:53.461
Extremely compassionate, extremely
kind, but very powerful.

00:41:53.662 --> 00:41:56.773
This is the balance.

00:42:00.589 --> 00:42:04.752
So He came on this earth to create
peace within our minds.

00:42:04.953 --> 00:42:08.752
On this earth there is no peace, why?
What’s wrong?

00:42:08.953 --> 00:42:11.814
It’s only the human beings are not
peaceful.

00:42:12.015 --> 00:42:19.042
When this peace will be settled
within yourself? Who is violent?

00:42:19.243 --> 00:42:23.234
Human beings are violent to each other.

00:42:24.907 --> 00:42:29.510
Ego developed subtler ways and
subtler ways.

00:42:29.711 --> 00:42:36.967
Then, provocative ways started
coming up also from the superego,

00:42:37.168 --> 00:42:43.297
sly methods from the superego.
The conflict started.

00:42:45.001 --> 00:42:51.383
And at that time, to overcome
that conflict,

00:42:52.921 --> 00:42:57.946
the best thing was to create a space
in Agnya,

00:42:58.147 --> 00:43:02.265
in the center, in thoughtless awareness.

00:43:03.395 --> 00:43:07.492
That’s how Christ had to come
on this earth.

00:43:08.052 --> 00:43:13.961
The birth is very, very symbolic.

00:43:15.329 --> 00:43:23.986
Because He’s nothing but Chaitanya,
He’s nothing but the Word as you call it,

00:43:24.187 --> 00:43:29.430
Logos – I don’t know what all words
you have got in language,

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:34.064
the Shabda, as they call it,
is the Aumkara –

00:43:34.264 --> 00:43:41.093
He was to be born in this way, because
He had no body,

00:43:46.211 --> 00:43:49.945
and the subtlest of subtle He had to be.

00:43:50.226 --> 00:43:58.619
Because the work was very subtle, Sukshma,
that’s why He was born like that.

00:43:58.859 --> 00:44:03.472
It’s very poetic to see Him lying down
in a manger, for people,

00:44:03.711 --> 00:44:12.828
that look at this: the King of Heaven
should…

00:44:14.094 --> 00:44:17.469
[Shri Mataji: It’s all right. Now she does
that to understand.

00:44:24.516 --> 00:44:28.141
(To the little girl who wants again
something:) Don’t go near that.]

00:44:34.741 --> 00:44:47.875
So the story of His birth was very
interesting tale.

00:44:50.391 --> 00:44:57.390
It was very symbolic that He came
in a humble place,

00:44:58.795 --> 00:45:02.017
because people were so proud
of their money,

00:45:02.218 --> 00:45:06.666
so arrogant because of their power
that they had.

00:45:06.866 --> 00:45:11.312
Even today all the Christian nations
are like that.

00:45:11.656 --> 00:45:15.827
Surprisingly, Christian nations should be
so arrogant

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:24.109
and so power-drunk and think no end
of themselves because they are affluent.

00:45:25.935 --> 00:45:30.432
Think of the Christian nations being
very poor,

00:45:30.633 --> 00:45:34.437
do you think they would have had
racial problem?

00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:43.984
They don’t have racial problems
with Arabs. Not at all.

00:45:45.781 --> 00:45:50.158
As simple as that. No problem with Arabs.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:55.796
They have no race, Arabs have no race,
they have money, money race.

00:45:56.100 --> 00:46:01.397
Those people who hanker after money
are only bowing down to money.

00:46:01.717 --> 00:46:05.983
They have no respect for anything
else but for money.

00:46:10.103 --> 00:46:15.555
Those who have money and think
of money

00:46:15.756 --> 00:46:23.139
are another lot which is going to go out
of the circulation of evolution.

00:46:23.339 --> 00:46:26.764
They are going out already.

00:46:27.147 --> 00:46:31.446
The second lot is the one which was
like Romans.

00:46:31.647 --> 00:46:37.670
They had a fall, they were all finished
because they were power-drunk.

00:46:37.889 --> 00:46:46.482
They drank away, their civilization
completely finished off and they are out.

00:46:48.654 --> 00:46:52.032
You’ve seen Portugal, you’ll be amazed,
it’s happening there.

00:46:52.232 --> 00:46:56.434
The ego of Portuguese was so great,
you can’t believe

00:46:56.634 --> 00:47:01.181
that that country is a desolate country,
there’s nothing now,

00:47:01.382 --> 00:47:05.560
big-big, huge big buildings, which you see

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:08.577
and you know they must have been rich
once upon a time.

00:47:08.777 --> 00:47:11.449
And there’s nothing left with them
except for their antique shops

00:47:11.650 --> 00:47:14.682
which are never open.

00:47:15.691 --> 00:47:22.889
This kind of a ego is again revived

00:47:24.826 --> 00:47:34.240
and that revival came up, imagine,
in the name of Christ. Imagine!

00:47:35.975 --> 00:47:41.076
They purchased people to be
converted as Christians.

00:47:41.469 --> 00:47:43.214
They gave them money,

00:47:43.414 --> 00:47:49.717
is all money, money propositions,
money enterprise going on.

00:47:52.076 --> 00:47:56.908
Jews the same, then the Christians
the same.

00:47:57.109 --> 00:48:00.798
He was born in a manger.

00:48:01.505 --> 00:48:12.100
For a little child to be put in a manger
by the Mahalakshmi, it’s too much.

00:48:12.506 --> 00:48:14.902
See how symbolic it is, Mahalakshmi,

00:48:15.102 --> 00:48:23.084
was not Lakshmi, but Mahalakshmi to put
the child in the manger.

00:48:24.467 --> 00:48:26.788
No place.

00:48:26.988 --> 00:48:34.922
We have at least Chelsham Road,
Warwick Road,

00:48:35.123 --> 00:48:42.186
Bramham Gardens, Brompton Square.

00:48:44.967 --> 00:48:48.758
But the child was born and was put
in the manger,

00:48:48.963 --> 00:48:53.623
the humblest thing in this world
is a manger.

00:48:55.253 --> 00:48:59.686
The humblest of all, a crib,

00:49:00.014 --> 00:49:04.449
the Highest is put in the manger.

00:49:08.576 --> 00:49:11.522
So, what do we do?

00:49:12.244 --> 00:49:14.422
We think we should also sleep in a manger,

00:49:14.623 --> 00:49:20.953
we’ll become like Christ. There are people
who believe in such nonsensical things.

00:49:21.154 --> 00:49:24.677
They think that, you see if they have
all the money,

00:49:24.878 --> 00:49:28.811
they drink and do all kinds of things,
you see -

00:49:29.119 --> 00:49:32.608
I met one man one day,

00:49:33.369 --> 00:49:37.811
he was all drunk lying near a church.

00:49:38.553 --> 00:49:41.221
He was saying: “I’m Christ, I’m Christ.”

00:49:41.421 --> 00:49:47.194
He must have had got this idea that
he’s lying there because he’s very humble.

00:49:47.668 --> 00:49:52.066
This kind of ridiculous caricature

00:49:52.267 --> 00:49:58.417
of the whole beautiful symbol is followed
everywhere.

00:50:03.717 --> 00:50:08.623
So the arrogant and the egoistical might
say that: “Why, if He was the King,

00:50:08.824 --> 00:50:14.598
why was He born in the manger?
Why was He kept in the manger?”.

00:50:14.799 --> 00:50:18.881
Everybody will have their own concept.

00:50:21.361 --> 00:50:26.976
Even there are people in India, who are
stupid people, not wise,

00:50:27.177 --> 00:50:32.858
who say that He must have done lots
of bad karmas to be born like that.

00:50:34.389 --> 00:50:42.852
Because to them, karmas give you more
money, I mean, God is not so unintelligent.

00:50:43.053 --> 00:50:49.670
If you do good karmas you become men
of God, you become seekers.

00:50:52.944 --> 00:50:57.819
You get the blessings of God by your good
karmas, you’ll become religious people,

00:50:58.019 --> 00:51:02.110
not moneyed people who can go to pubs
and waste their lives.

00:51:02.311 --> 00:51:07.707
This is the idea they have got that
by doing good karmas you become rich,

00:51:07.908 --> 00:51:14.795
and become even worse for next life.
Some people may believe like that.

00:51:16.335 --> 00:51:20.976
But He never did any karmas.
He was in akarma Himself,

00:51:21.177 --> 00:51:23.932
so no question of His punishment
and all that,

00:51:24.132 --> 00:51:28.383
because just a drama, but very
symbolic it is.

00:51:28.584 --> 00:51:35.049
Now see, a little child put in the manger,
no comfort.

00:51:35.326 --> 00:51:40.767
Can there be any comfort in a manger?
Think like that.

00:51:40.968 --> 00:51:45.615
All the Christian nations are after
their comforts.

00:51:48.128 --> 00:51:50.623
Aren’t we?

00:51:51.404 --> 00:51:56.678
What we think is not comfortable,
it should be comfortable.

00:51:56.899 --> 00:52:04.381
Christians should never seek comfort, that
is one of the messages of Christ’s birth.

00:52:07.417 --> 00:52:10.936
If they seek comfort then they are away
from Christ,

00:52:11.137 --> 00:52:14.889
because He was born in a manger.

00:52:15.449 --> 00:52:19.373
No comfort was provided for Him.

00:52:22.495 --> 00:52:27.714
But that doesn’t mean that you should
assume some sort of a funny habitation,

00:52:27.914 --> 00:52:32.125
it doesn’t mean that also, I mean I have
to tell the other side of it, you see.

00:52:32.326 --> 00:52:36.835
Copying Him is not the way, is not
the way by copying Him

00:52:37.036 --> 00:52:42.804
that you will become Christ, but
by imbibing His qualities within you.

00:52:43.005 --> 00:52:45.342
I’ve known people who live in a pigsty,

00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:50.969
but once they get to a better life
they want everything else.

00:52:52.706 --> 00:53:02.467
So imbibing the quality of humility
and adjustment.

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:11.998
Humility and adjustment.

00:53:14.904 --> 00:53:18.793
Anywhere you are put, anytime.

00:53:18.994 --> 00:53:24.821
Very particular about time. If somebody
has to come at ten o’clock,

00:53:25.022 --> 00:53:28.258
and if he has to do a job, if it is
[that] he’s delayed by five minutes,

00:53:28.459 --> 00:53:34.287
he starts breaking all the heavens,
just can’t bear it,

00:53:35.429 --> 00:53:39.175
he can’t bear it, five minutes he has
to wait.

00:53:39.375 --> 00:53:43.279
And if he has to wait ten minutes,
he’s out for a pub, finished.

00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:48.610
He cannot be pacifying himself unless
and until he takes a drink.

00:53:48.811 --> 00:53:54.088
This is the situation of a volcanic
human mind.

00:53:58.001 --> 00:54:01.424
So the peace has to come.

00:54:05.229 --> 00:54:10.191
How? If you seek comfort you’ll become
lazy lumps.

00:54:10.392 --> 00:54:14.877
You’ll sleep off, you’ll be lotus-eaters.

00:54:15.975 --> 00:54:21.995
But if you not seek comfort, then
peace will come.

00:54:26.438 --> 00:54:29.747
Because for our own comfort, for our
selfish comfort

00:54:29.948 --> 00:54:33.008
of this body we torture everybody else.

00:54:33.208 --> 00:54:36.495
The other day only I was telling that
only in the Western countries it is so,

00:54:36.704 --> 00:54:39.182
not in India.

00:54:39.704 --> 00:54:42.001
If somebody’s sleeping even till twelve
o’clock

00:54:42.178 --> 00:54:47.306
you cannot wake up that person,
is a irreligious act.

00:54:47.507 --> 00:54:50.278
I mean in India anybody who sleeps
after six o’clock

00:54:50.479 --> 00:54:53.502
he’ll feel ashamed of himself to be
sleeping that time.

00:54:53.703 --> 00:54:55.659
He’ll be apologetic the whole day

00:54:55.859 --> 00:54:57.431
and he’ll say that, “Oh, God, I’m sorry
I slept.”

00:54:57.631 --> 00:55:03.667
It’s regarded as sinful to sleep so late
as six o’clock in the morning.

00:55:04.104 --> 00:55:07.635
I mean, any country like that.

00:55:14.097 --> 00:55:19.642
So comfort has no end. There’s no end
to it.

00:55:19.842 --> 00:55:25.964
Comfort crawls upon you, what is comfort?
Let us see, very simple.

00:55:26.165 --> 00:55:30.386
In Christ’s symbolic life, its very deep
significance is this:

00:55:30.587 --> 00:55:35.444
that comfort is nothing but the matter
overpowering the Spirit.

00:55:35.645 --> 00:55:38.326
Do you see that point?

00:55:38.526 --> 00:55:41.887
If you are sitting on a chair, then
you can’t sit on the ground.

00:55:42.087 --> 00:55:45.014
If you are sitting on a sofa set you
can’t sit on a chair.

00:55:45.214 --> 00:55:49.411
If you are sitting on a velvet, then you
cannot sit you know on an ordinary thing.

00:55:49.612 --> 00:55:53.590
Is the matter always overpowering
the Spirit and He was the Spirit,

00:55:53.791 --> 00:55:58.581
what does it matter to Him? Whether
straw or anything?

00:56:04.846 --> 00:56:09.874
It is insurmountable, nothing can
displease the Spirit

00:56:10.074 --> 00:56:15.237
of these material things, I mean the matter
otherwise will take over.

00:56:19.303 --> 00:56:23.374
That is the thing is, one has
to understand,

00:56:25.690 --> 00:56:28.239
that He was the Spirit and if you have
to become the Spirit,

00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:33.150
first of all, try to give up your comforts,
lash your bodies a little bit,

00:56:33.350 --> 00:56:35.919
I’m sorry on a Christmas day I have
to say that,

00:56:36.119 --> 00:56:38.627
because He was also lashed that way.

00:56:38.828 --> 00:56:43.528
If you see on the day He was born,
for a mother to put the child

00:56:43.729 --> 00:56:49.502
in a crip that was a manger is too much
of a sacrifice.

00:56:51.238 --> 00:56:53.410
How much you want to do for your
children, you see,

00:56:53.611 --> 00:56:57.567
dress them up properly, do this, do that.

00:56:57.768 --> 00:57:02.628
But the child was to be put in a manger,
was put in a manger,

00:57:02.828 --> 00:57:11.213
just for you people to learn that comfort
crawls on the Spirit.

00:57:14.073 --> 00:57:20.482
We always seek the comfort. This one
thing is the message to all of us.

00:57:20.683 --> 00:57:26.309
If you seek your room, “I must have
a bathroom attached to that.”

00:57:26.510 --> 00:57:32.815
Again comfort. “What about my wife,
where is she going to sleep?”

00:57:33.015 --> 00:57:40.307
She’ll sleep as others are sleeping.
And you’ll sleep as others are sleeping.

00:57:41.784 --> 00:57:46.635
Nobody is going to die of that be sure,
I can assure you.

00:57:46.836 --> 00:57:49.228
Sahaj Yoga is very hard thing that way
you see,

00:57:49.428 --> 00:57:53.284
very few people die once they come
to Sahaj Yoga.

00:57:54.967 --> 00:58:00.877
Some of them should. But they don’t.

00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.110
They continue, they go on giving
Realization,

00:58:04.310 --> 00:58:08.690
they go on doing everything, still
they continue.

00:58:10.411 --> 00:58:17.651
Escape all the accidents, escape
all the problems and they continue.

00:58:19.901 --> 00:58:24.409
But this is a short time which must
be used.

00:58:24.609 --> 00:58:28.815
It’s a very, very concrete thing I wanted
to tell you today.

00:58:29.015 --> 00:58:33.250
It’s nice to talk of Christ’s birth,
be happy about it, sing songs,

00:58:33.450 --> 00:58:36.656
go into a mood like that, but really
I tell you,

00:58:36.856 --> 00:58:47.995
it’s a very symbolic case for all of us
to know that He slept in a manger.

00:58:48.465 --> 00:58:54.401
And the another symbolicism is that,
what did we offer Him?

00:58:55.088 --> 00:58:59.009
What did this world offer Him at that time?

00:58:59.210 --> 00:59:05.231
The another symbolicism is that they
offered Him a manger.

00:59:07.698 --> 00:59:12.555
Are we going to do the same to our Mother?

00:59:18.616 --> 00:59:22.034
This is one thing one has to know.

00:59:24.135 --> 00:59:29.044
Manger is, after all, is all right,
it doesn’t catches anything,

00:59:29.245 --> 00:59:33.149
it has no left Nabhi, right Nabhi, nothing.

00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:37.682
It doesn’t have all these problems.
There are no thorns,

00:59:37.883 --> 00:59:44.751
there’s no Agnya, there’s nobody
screwing up into Your stomach,

00:59:44.952 --> 00:59:50.307
suddenly feel, “Oh God, don’t want
to see”.

00:59:51.014 --> 00:59:58.909
So you are the thistles in that manger
which have to be soft

00:59:59.221 --> 01:00:02.534
to give comfort to Christ.

01:00:02.886 --> 01:00:11.440
You have to become so soft and so sweet,
so clean and pure,

01:00:11.641 --> 01:00:17.854
because a new babe is going to be put
in the manger.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:25.736
You are the kushas, is the thistle.

01:00:26.611 --> 01:00:30.548
And for a yogi the kushasana is the one
who sits on the kusha only.

01:00:30.772 --> 01:00:33.350
So He was a yogi, He came on the kusha,
all right.

01:00:33.550 --> 01:00:41.452
But now, what about you? To receive
Him in the manger, this is the manger.

01:00:42.276 --> 01:00:45.837
The Mother is preparing the manger

01:00:46.038 --> 01:00:54.702
to make the child feel very happy
and comforted, the thistles.

01:00:56.103 --> 01:01:05.278
Adamance, obstinacy, harshness, ugliness:

01:01:10.076 --> 01:01:13.635
all must be curbed down.

01:01:15.594 --> 01:01:19.847
It’s very symbolic, it’s very symbolic
I must say His birth;

01:01:20.047 --> 01:01:24.713
why, why, one should think, why was He
born like that?

01:01:27.065 --> 01:01:29.852
People might give any amount
of interpretations,

01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:33.565
but I know because I’ve done it.

01:01:35.925 --> 01:01:39.488
I’m trying to soften you, I’m trying
to mold you,

01:01:39.689 --> 01:01:42.823
sometimes I have to be harsh with you.

01:01:43.142 --> 01:01:49.007
Sometimes I have to be angry with you,
sometimes I have to tell you off.

01:01:49.207 --> 01:01:54.401
Just now there are some who are catching
so much on the Void,

01:01:54.602 --> 01:01:58.057
that My stomach is screwing up.

01:01:59.634 --> 01:02:03.325
It’s all right with Me, cause I’m supposed
to be that,

01:02:03.525 --> 01:02:06.956
I’m so fortunate that I have to face
all that.

01:02:07.156 --> 01:02:10.891
But what about Christ within us?

01:02:12.432 --> 01:02:17.382
You are not going to be happy
with yourself,

01:02:18.015 --> 01:02:20.987
with your being, with your Spirit,

01:02:21.187 --> 01:02:27.935
unless and until you create a manger
of very soft thistles.

01:02:32.358 --> 01:02:36.511
You yourself you are not going to enjoy.

01:02:36.735 --> 01:02:41.208
You think that by justifying your egos,
by justifying your arrogance,

01:02:41.408 --> 01:02:44.748
by justifying all that you are doing
to each other -

01:02:44.948 --> 01:02:48.919
some people are busy making money
out of Sahaj Yoga, some people are busy

01:02:49.120 --> 01:02:52.516
deceiving others, some are telling lies,
some are creating problems,

01:02:52.716 --> 01:02:55.614
some are beating wives and some wives
are provocating husbands,

01:02:55.815 --> 01:02:58.952
what is all this going on?

01:02:59.591 --> 01:03:03.963
We are creating a beautiful manger
for Christ,

01:03:05.591 --> 01:03:12.002
to create the peace on earth.
We have to be peaceful!

01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:20.949
To be peaceful one has to be humble,
this is the message of Christ, humble.

01:03:22.101 --> 01:03:26.596
If you become humble, peace will come.

01:03:26.933 --> 01:03:31.760
Humble is a good word, I don’t know
if it explains what it means.

01:03:33.243 --> 01:03:39.846
Humble means: “Not asking for your
own comfort, but comfort of others”.

01:03:41.390 --> 01:03:45.096
When others are before you,

01:03:48.734 --> 01:03:53.054
that is humility. It’s not: “Thank you
very much.”

01:03:53.255 --> 01:03:57.817
You kill somebody and then tell to the dead
person: “I’m sorry I killed you” – finished.

01:03:58.018 --> 01:04:02.911
In English language is over. Once
you have said: “I’m sorry,” finished.

01:04:03.111 --> 01:04:09.166
“Yes, I know,” and the another is “I know.”
“Why did you do it?” “I know”. Finished.

01:04:09.367 --> 01:04:16.893
If he knows, then it’s all right.
Then there’s no punishment. No.

01:04:18.993 --> 01:04:22.440
You don’t know,

01:04:23.378 --> 01:04:27.799
you are all the Spirit, so beautiful.

01:04:28.650 --> 01:04:33.252
You are to be chiseled out, all right,
that’s My job.

01:04:33.453 --> 01:04:36.430
You are to be cleaned out, that’s My job,
all right.

01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:44.862
Kundalini awakening is My job, agreed,
but maintenance is yours.

01:04:47.146 --> 01:04:51.151
On the contrary sometimes I feel,

01:04:52.299 --> 01:04:56.838
because I do all this, the maintenance
is poor, very, very poor.

01:04:57.038 --> 01:05:02.495
Like in India I see some people try
to help us, by giving us money, you see.

01:05:02.695 --> 01:05:05.614
We didn’t earn the money ourselves,
you see, somebody donated money

01:05:05.815 --> 01:05:11.730
and they built some wells, all are
dilapidated and finished,

01:05:11.931 --> 01:05:18.321
free gift, nobody wants to look after it.
It’s human nature.

01:05:18.522 --> 01:05:22.176
If you don’t work hard for your
maintenance,

01:05:22.377 --> 01:05:24.599
and just leave it to Mother, “Oh,
She will cure us,

01:05:24.799 --> 01:05:28.982
let us continue what we want to do,
She’s coming after all,

01:05:29.182 --> 01:05:32.651
She’s going to look after us”,
we’ll lag behind.

01:05:32.851 --> 01:05:39.743
That’s why My presence can be sometimes
in a way not so fruitful.

01:05:39.944 --> 01:05:43.448
My presence in England

01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:49.323
is good up to a point,

01:05:50.048 --> 01:05:55.362
and afterwards it should not be there
for some time.

01:05:57.627 --> 01:06:00.288
I love you very much, you know that,
very much.

01:06:00.488 --> 01:06:04.233
I - England is My heart, and I have
to be here,

01:06:04.433 --> 01:06:08.686
and this Christmas I wanted to celebrate
with you and the New Year with you

01:06:08.886 --> 01:06:13.567
just out of My own desire. But I have
to make you understand

01:06:13.768 --> 01:06:21.424
that you have to work harder and harder
to keep yourself clean.

01:06:22.610 --> 01:06:29.103
Get rid of your problems, come up,
do not say that,

01:06:29.304 --> 01:06:33.793
“Yes, it is like this Mother.” All the time
you are reporting to Me,

01:06:33.994 --> 01:06:36.341
“Still Mother I’m catching, see now
this is happening,”

01:06:36.542 --> 01:06:40.495
as if it’s a boastful thing to say.

01:06:41.724 --> 01:06:45.698
“I will get all right, I have to be
all right,

01:06:45.898 --> 01:06:50.612
now Mother has gone, let Me show Her
when I come back”.

01:06:53.924 --> 01:06:56.972
When I once went to Bombay, Raulbai
did not come to see Me

01:06:57.172 --> 01:07:00.532
for seven days and she was in Bombay,
she had arrived to see Me.

01:07:00.737 --> 01:07:04.365
So I asked them, “What’s the matter,
is she keeping all right, is she all right?

01:07:04.565 --> 01:07:09.979
Then why didn’t she come to see Me?”
I was thinking what’s the matter with her.

01:07:11.073 --> 01:07:14.073
She came to see Me after seven days.
She said, “Mother, I’m sorry

01:07:14.274 --> 01:07:16.920
I didn’t come to see You because
I was caught up this time,

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:21.221
I wanted to cleanse myself before showing
My face to You.”

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:31.954
So, cleansing is to be done, maintenance
is to be done,

01:07:32.154 --> 01:07:39.174
raising of the Kundalini, collectivity,
collectivity:

01:07:39.863 --> 01:07:42.411
look after each other, you have to only
support Sahaj Yogis

01:07:42.612 --> 01:07:46.494
and not others, outsiders, they are
outsiders, they are not us,

01:07:46.695 --> 01:07:49.431
we are Sahaj Yogis, and those who try
to support others

01:07:49.631 --> 01:07:55.318
are no more Sahaj Yogis, they get out
of Sahaj Yoga would be better for us.

01:07:55.519 --> 01:07:59.221
Whatever we are, we are among ourselves.

01:07:59.422 --> 01:08:02.240
Outsiders are outsiders, we have to love
each other,

01:08:02.440 --> 01:08:05.376
we have to respect each other as saints.

01:08:05.576 --> 01:08:09.779
Nobody has to say anything harsh things
to each other. No.

01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:13.690
Be kind, loving, affectionate.

01:08:14.526 --> 01:08:18.939
Curb down your tongues, be humble.

01:08:19.166 --> 01:08:24.914
Humility, humility is the thing one
has to be.

01:08:25.114 --> 01:08:30.917
Write it down with big words, be humble,
be humble, be humble.

01:08:33.760 --> 01:08:41.034
And when you become humble, such peace
will reign,

01:08:43.547 --> 01:08:47.938
and you will feel so nice, being humble,
there’s nothing wrong.

01:08:48.138 --> 01:08:50.160
Christ has gone to this extent to say

01:08:50.360 --> 01:08:55.071
that somebody slaps on this face you turn
the other. Be humble.

01:08:55.271 --> 01:08:59.081
With Romans there was no other way out.

01:09:04.387 --> 01:09:08.547
There was no other way out. Also,
He preached humility,

01:09:08.747 --> 01:09:12.659
throughout He preached humility.

01:09:12.859 --> 01:09:15.372
You be humble to each other, that’s all.

01:09:15.573 --> 01:09:18.010
You need not be humble to others, because

01:09:18.211 --> 01:09:22.006
no one can now torture the saints, is over,
that situation is over,

01:09:22.207 --> 01:09:25.307
but you be humble to each other.

01:09:28.471 --> 01:09:33.659
Humble in your demands of life.

01:09:33.889 --> 01:09:36.959
That doesn’t mean that you should
become people

01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:40.941
[Aside: Just keep it there.] Just that
you become people

01:09:41.142 --> 01:09:46.594
of a strange characters, you see,

01:09:46.795 --> 01:09:52.398
that doesn’t mean that, should be
decent, with decorum,

01:09:52.599 --> 01:10:00.252
as Christ was when He was born.
But you should be humble.

01:10:00.677 --> 01:10:04.567
Try to mould your bodies, make them
lighter

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:08.216
in the sense that you can sit anywhere,
you can move anywhere,

01:10:08.417 --> 01:10:13.104
you can lie everywhere - you are all
young people,

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:16.893
adjust yourself.

01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:19.035
If somebody has one room you should say,

01:10:19.245 --> 01:10:23.026
“All right, doesn’t matter, I can live
in the corridor, don’t worry.”

01:10:23.312 --> 01:10:26.203
But they will be first jumping,
I’ve seen that,

01:10:26.404 --> 01:10:30.398
to the room which has the attached bath.

01:10:30.631 --> 01:10:33.360
How many of you have rooms with
attached baths, let’s see?

01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:38.354
Raise the hands, living in the ashram.

01:10:40.749 --> 01:10:46.526
Better give up. Better give up.

01:10:46.981 --> 01:10:50.274
See now? Better give up.

01:10:50.475 --> 01:10:55.300
All of you give up your rooms and stay
in rooms which are shared.

01:10:55.501 --> 01:10:58.752
Now it’s all right for you not to share
because you are husband and wife,

01:10:58.952 --> 01:11:02.401
but need not ask for attached bath.

01:11:08.650 --> 01:11:11.550
Comforts are to be given up for others,
not for you.

01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:16.596
You should make others comfortable,
not yourself.

01:11:19.383 --> 01:11:24.600
Sometimes I’m surprised at human beings
how they allow others to eat anything,

01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:29.422
the way they are self-centered is
something surprising.

01:11:29.623 --> 01:11:35.208
But after Sahaj Yoga you change!
You enjoy giving comfort to others,

01:11:35.409 --> 01:11:41.932
saying comforting words to others,
sweet things to others, you enjoy that!

01:11:42.277 --> 01:11:48.210
Christ was given the crib of a manger

01:11:48.410 --> 01:11:53.335
and He came to comfort you, to give
you peace

01:11:53.535 --> 01:11:59.919
and He came as a Saviour, can you
imagine the contrast?

01:12:00.119 --> 01:12:06.742
You are the saviours of the whole
universe now, as He was Saviour.

01:12:06.942 --> 01:12:13.472
But, you cannot be selfish, you cannot
be comfortable.

01:12:13.672 --> 01:12:16.161
You have to be like Christ, He used
to live wherever He liked:

01:12:16.361 --> 01:12:20.463
He lived in forest, He lived anywhere.

01:12:20.790 --> 01:12:27.792
Just working hard for people, He would
never even have His food sometimes.

01:12:29.952 --> 01:12:36.363
He lived under all circumstances,
under all conditions;

01:12:36.564 --> 01:12:41.135
He never asked for any comfort, nothing.

01:12:42.417 --> 01:12:46.500
He was a carpenter, He never even
used a glove.

01:12:46.700 --> 01:12:50.057
Here you must have gloves.

01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:55.296
You must have socks, you must have shoes,

01:12:55.496 --> 01:12:59.114
you must have a shaving this, He never
shaved even,

01:12:59.315 --> 01:13:02.885
that doesn’t mean you grow your beard.

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:12.495
But He was a very clean person.

01:13:18.293 --> 01:13:24.221
He lived with the minimum of minimum, that’s
what one has to do, is to reduce things.

01:13:25.432 --> 01:13:27.939
You know, I have everything that one
can think of,

01:13:28.139 --> 01:13:33.346
but I can live with the minimum of minimum,
I can live with two saris,

01:13:33.575 --> 01:13:36.721
and sometimes with one.

01:13:38.104 --> 01:13:44.002
You should be able to live with minimum
of minimum, that’s the point is.

01:13:48.264 --> 01:13:52.401
And that is what one has to learn
from His life is

01:13:52.602 --> 01:13:56.388
that we are the saviours today,

01:13:56.589 --> 01:14:03.748
and Saviour lived just like a humble
person,

01:14:03.948 --> 01:14:09.411
very elite in His behavior, very dignified.

01:14:09.611 --> 01:14:12.071
He was not behaving like a beggar going,
“heh, heh, heh,” like that.

01:14:12.272 --> 01:14:15.160
some of them, you are like that also,
you see, you go about like this,

01:14:15.361 --> 01:14:20.245
when you talk, like this you go about,
that’s not the way!

01:14:20.446 --> 01:14:27.282
With dignity, with your magnificence,
with your gravity, move about.

01:14:27.482 --> 01:14:34.456
Actually those who are really great,
those who are the real emperors,

01:14:34.656 --> 01:14:38.982
do not need anything. Ah, what can
dominate them, tell Me?

01:14:39.182 --> 01:14:41.618
If you are the emperor of this world,

01:14:41.818 --> 01:14:44.058
if you know you are the queen
of this world,

01:14:44.259 --> 01:14:48.866
what is more important, what comfort
can dominate?

01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:55.212
What material thing can charm such
a person?

01:14:55.412 --> 01:15:00.128
Because that person is above, that’s
badshah, that’s the king,

01:15:00.328 --> 01:15:06.236
that’s the real sign of a king,
king of heaven,

01:15:06.437 --> 01:15:11.614
not of England, or of any place,
but of heaven.

01:15:11.815 --> 01:15:17.195
And that’s what you are, you are
the citizens of that kingdom,

01:15:17.395 --> 01:15:24.120
to you these things should be absolutely
useless.

01:15:26.516 --> 01:15:33.534
The beauty of the matter should be seen,
not the possession of it.

01:15:36.012 --> 01:15:38.428
Beauty is the comfort,

01:15:38.628 --> 01:15:42.289
not what you feel in the body, like
having comfortable things.

01:15:42.489 --> 01:15:47.127
Beauty is so comforting, people do not know

01:15:47.465 --> 01:15:50.713
how comforting is the beauty.

01:15:52.982 --> 01:15:58.097
And that I’m sure while we are celebrating
His birth today,

01:15:58.297 --> 01:16:08.249
we glorify Him, by accepting a kind
of a martyr Spirit,

01:16:08.450 --> 01:16:12.346
a Spirit in which you are dedicated,

01:16:12.987 --> 01:16:16.870
in which you do not demand anything,
but you give.

01:16:17.071 --> 01:16:20.049
You do not ask for anything, but you give.

01:16:20.250 --> 01:16:24.080
Even today I received letter from people
saying that:

01:16:24.281 --> 01:16:31.838
“Please, I want a job, can you help Me,
will You bring?”.

01:16:32.785 --> 01:16:38.745
All sort of things like that. It can be
any sort of a nonsense.

01:16:38.946 --> 01:16:41.461
Of course, I mean, one can have
all that kind of thing,

01:16:41.661 --> 01:16:47.217
but ask for one and that is the Spirit.

01:16:47.417 --> 01:16:50.690
And once you ask for that,

01:16:52.177 --> 01:16:57.047
nothing higher to what you’ve asked for.

01:16:57.248 --> 01:17:03.817
Then you don’t want anything else,
the enjoyment is complete.

01:17:04.018 --> 01:17:08.572
So to celebrate His birthday and to rejoice
in that,

01:17:08.772 --> 01:17:12.618
is to rejoice in our

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:24.367
adequacies. If you are adequate you do not
hanker after your inadequacies, don’t you?

01:17:24.568 --> 01:17:28.682
If you are complete, if you are full,
if you are satisfied

01:17:28.882 --> 01:17:32.117
you do not hanker, do you?

01:17:32.710 --> 01:17:37.240
So enjoy your adequacies, your
completeness,

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:47.695
your fullness, and your complete
satisfaction, enjoy that.

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:51.299
Ultimately, all these things lead to some
sort of a satisfaction.

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:54.907
Of course, I don’t know if you get
any satisfaction out of that,

01:17:55.107 --> 01:18:01.698
but the real satisfaction that is within
you is the Spirit, you enjoy that.

01:18:03.414 --> 01:18:09.311
This is for yourself, and for others
you are a comforter to others.

01:18:09.511 --> 01:18:13.182
It’s not that anybody who talks to you
will come and complain to Me:

01:18:13.383 --> 01:18:16.711
“Mother, he has bitten me.

01:18:17.969 --> 01:18:24.445
I had a meeting with another scorpion,
he bit me.

01:18:26.538 --> 01:18:30.953
I touched somebody and he hit me.”

01:18:33.255 --> 01:18:37.303
Comfort. You are a thing of comfort
to others,

01:18:37.504 --> 01:18:43.623
believe Me, you are. Comfort others.

01:18:46.386 --> 01:18:52.898
So those who comfort others do not
bother about their comfort.

01:18:53.099 --> 01:18:58.859
The shepherds, simple people,

01:18:59.060 --> 01:19:05.867
in this cold, imagine they were outside,
and they saw the vision of the angel.

01:19:06.068 --> 01:19:10.611
It can only be seen by people who
are humble,

01:19:10.859 --> 01:19:14.406
who are leading a humble life,

01:19:14.794 --> 01:19:21.125
He appeared to them and the another
was, vision, to the Wise.

01:19:22.761 --> 01:19:25.644
So only the humble people and the wise
people -

01:19:25.844 --> 01:19:28.496
wisdom, common sense and wisdom.

01:19:28.696 --> 01:19:32.510
Those who are not wise can never
understand, can never understand,

01:19:32.710 --> 01:19:37.104
those who are intelligent and intellectuals
are not wise people at all,

01:19:37.305 --> 01:19:42.531
they are stupid, you know that they
are stupid people.

01:19:42.937 --> 01:19:50.168
Wisdom. So the three wise men and
the shepherd is another great symbolism,

01:19:50.368 --> 01:19:57.336
those who will understand Sahaja Yoga -
simple people, shepherds.

01:20:01.271 --> 01:20:04.781
And another are the wise.

01:20:06.578 --> 01:20:12.742
Only the wise can understand the star.

01:20:16.592 --> 01:20:19.844
So many must have seen the star.

01:20:21.520 --> 01:20:23.872
Wise men from the East. It’s true.

01:20:24.073 --> 01:20:28.117
Eastern people are much more wiser
than other people, no doubt about it.

01:20:28.317 --> 01:20:31.936
But why? Let’s see why they are wiser.

01:20:32.136 --> 01:20:38.820
Eastern are wiser, up to a point.

01:20:43.874 --> 01:20:48.867
In your body, there is East and West
if you see.

01:20:49.374 --> 01:20:57.852
East is left side and West is right side.

01:20:58.469 --> 01:21:07.430
Eastern are the left sided, nearer
the heart.

01:21:07.844 --> 01:21:11.604
But not the Eastern most are Japanese,
horrible people,

01:21:11.805 --> 01:21:17.979
Japanese, horrible, then the - all these
people who are selling you

01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:21.308
these drugs and all that, they are
worst of all.

01:21:21.508 --> 01:21:26.783
But those who know and are left-sided,

01:21:26.983 --> 01:21:37.491
the combination of knowledge and love,
knowledge and compassion.

01:21:37.692 --> 01:21:41.725
If there is no love, if there is
no compassion,

01:21:41.925 --> 01:21:49.105
I mean you, just can’t talk to that
person. He’s like a stick!

01:21:49.305 --> 01:21:53.653
I mean, in a dried stick what vibrations
can I give, you just tell Me?

01:21:53.854 --> 01:21:59.008
A dried stick, straightforward dried stick,
you see.

01:21:59.413 --> 01:22:01.703
What vibrations I can give to a dried
stick?

01:22:01.903 --> 01:22:11.997
There should be some sort of a greenery
in it, isn’t it? Little bit at least.

01:22:12.198 --> 01:22:16.915
If it is too much of water also it is
spoiled, can be rotten.

01:22:17.115 --> 01:22:24.495
But if it is a dry stick straightforward,
you know what I mean, dry sticks are -

01:22:24.662 --> 01:22:26.991
then how can you give vibrations
to such a person?

01:22:27.191 --> 01:22:29.391
You cannot. You cannot raise such a person.

01:22:29.592 --> 01:22:34.945
So, first thing is love, and wisdom
comes through love.

01:22:35.473 --> 01:22:41.352
Wisdom doesn’t come through intelligence,
it comes through love.

01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:48.049
When you love someone, you get the light
of wisdom.

01:22:48.250 --> 01:22:51.010
By thinking you can never become wise,
you can become stupid,

01:22:51.211 --> 01:22:58.209
absolutely stupid, but by loving you can
become very wise.

01:22:58.410 --> 01:23:01.783
Then I see Sahaj Yogis suddenly they
say some things extremely wise,

01:23:01.984 --> 01:23:06.219
something great, suddenly say something
that’s so sweet

01:23:06.420 --> 01:23:10.393
and so nice, I said: “That’s it, the heart
has opened out”.

01:23:10.594 --> 01:23:13.370
The fragrance of wisdom comes from
the heart

01:23:13.570 --> 01:23:17.738
and that is symbolic now, that three
of them came,

01:23:17.938 --> 01:23:22.219
and they were who? Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha.

01:23:25.468 --> 01:23:30.586
They came to see Christ – Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

01:23:34.692 --> 01:23:37.687
See the vibrations.

01:23:47.245 --> 01:23:51.148
Because They only can recognize,

01:23:54.234 --> 01:24:00.969
not ordinary people, Romans, no.

01:24:04.712 --> 01:24:07.625
So They came.

01:24:07.991 --> 01:24:12.859
So we have to be humble and we have
to be wise.

01:24:13.617 --> 01:24:19.828
Wisdom is such a, such a diamond,

01:24:20.029 --> 01:24:23.856
it has so many facets that I cannot
describe to you in a short time,

01:24:24.057 --> 01:24:27.172
one day I’ll talk about wisdom.

01:24:28.678 --> 01:24:33.655
But it’s all common sense, so sweet,
so beautiful,

01:24:33.855 --> 01:24:37.416
where to say what, how to change
the subject,

01:24:37.616 --> 01:24:45.631
where to assert more, where to handle
a situation in a strong way,

01:24:45.831 --> 01:24:54.586
is to, where to be a gentleman and where
to be uncouth,

01:24:55.658 --> 01:25:00.756
where to shout at people and where to be
quiet and humble and sweet.

01:25:00.957 --> 01:25:05.367
All such a judgment you see, is all
that is wisdom, you see.

01:25:05.757 --> 01:25:09.134
Is a center of gravity,

01:25:09.334 --> 01:25:12.693
and to achieve that you have to give up
your extreme behavior.

01:25:12.893 --> 01:25:20.039
Obstinacy is the first thing that should be
given up, for all wisdom, obstinacy.

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:31.281
To have a son like Christ was such
a great boon

01:25:31.481 --> 01:25:38.674
I mean, so confident You know, feel,
“adhara”, the complete rapport is there,

01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:44.594
no problem of any kind, to have a son
like Him,

01:25:45.819 --> 01:25:50.977
completely obedient, absolutely 100%
obedience and humility

01:25:51.178 --> 01:25:56.128
and understanding of Your Being.

01:25:58.745 --> 01:26:01.875
No problems.

01:26:03.940 --> 01:26:08.134
You are all My sons too, and made
after Him,

01:26:08.335 --> 01:26:12.719
after the same pattern as I made Christ.

01:26:13.312 --> 01:26:18.055
I’m proud of you, you are My children,

01:26:18.667 --> 01:26:24.438
come up to it, and you have an example
already created for you.

01:26:26.619 --> 01:26:31.112
Before you is Christ, you see Him,
what a support it was,

01:26:31.313 --> 01:26:34.415
I never had any complaints of any kind,
no upset,

01:26:34.615 --> 01:26:38.635
He would never be upset, no question!

01:26:38.835 --> 01:26:40.273
He would never tell Me, “I’m upset,” never,

01:26:40.474 --> 01:26:47.625
this word doesn’t exist in the dictionary
of wise.

01:26:51.667 --> 01:26:57.297
You are never - how can you be upset,
when you are set once for all?

01:26:59.768 --> 01:27:03.370
This word must go from the dictionary
of many Sahaj Yogis who use it,

01:27:03.571 --> 01:27:06.802
problems and upset.

01:27:11.376 --> 01:27:15.146
You solve the problem, give the solutions.

01:27:15.347 --> 01:27:19.336
No problems, only solutions.

01:27:23.031 --> 01:27:26.547
That’s the way a son should be to a mother,

01:27:26.747 --> 01:27:32.524
that she can depend on him, absolutely,
no problems there, nothing,

01:27:32.724 --> 01:27:38.578
I mean, you have a son born like Christ,
what is there to worry about anything?

01:27:42.034 --> 01:27:51.148
Even the one word He said: “Behold
the Mother”, is a mantra,

01:27:51.349 --> 01:27:56.539
is the greatest mantra that I use.

01:27:57.347 --> 01:28:02.013
When your attention is here and there,
I just say that mantra to you,

01:28:02.213 --> 01:28:09.634
as a command it is! And so humble,
so confident: “Behold”.

01:28:09.834 --> 01:28:15.852
“Behold” doesn’t mean look, no, it’s a very
humble way of addressing,

01:28:16.052 --> 01:28:18.987
‘behold,’ it’s something glorious,
something great,

01:28:19.187 --> 01:28:23.526
behold it, accept it, understand.

01:28:23.726 --> 01:28:27.428
It was such a mutual understanding
of support and love

01:28:27.628 --> 01:28:30.742
that should exist between us.

01:28:31.459 --> 01:28:37.070
No secretiveness, no formalities,
no exclusiveness.

01:28:39.845 --> 01:28:42.643
No exclusiveness, all enjoyments must
be together.

01:28:42.844 --> 01:28:49.112
Now all your ideas of having separate
enjoyments

01:28:49.313 --> 01:28:53.029
must be given up for a change.

01:28:53.229 --> 01:29:01.035
Holiday is when you are in the company
of your, no more holidays, Sahaj Yogis.

01:29:01.236 --> 01:29:03.752
All these things must be given up.

01:29:03.952 --> 01:29:07.752
This is all against Christ’s behavior.

01:29:07.952 --> 01:29:12.305
He never had a holiday, never.

01:29:15.703 --> 01:29:18.875
This is holidaying.

01:29:22.345 --> 01:29:26.088
Holiday comes from the word holy day.

01:29:26.288 --> 01:29:30.397
Every day that is spent, every minute
that is spent

01:29:30.598 --> 01:29:35.752
in the company of Christ is a holy day.

01:29:38.608 --> 01:29:39.802
So they must have brought it down,

01:29:40.002 --> 01:29:49.049
Christ to Spirit and Spirit to spirits
and spirits to other things. I’m sure.

01:29:49.249 --> 01:29:56.676
I mean, that way, human beings are very
great at deriving at right points, you see,

01:29:56.876 --> 01:29:59.577
and jumping into ditches directly.

01:29:59.777 --> 01:30:04.201
So they must have done it so sweetly,
beautifully,

01:30:04.401 --> 01:30:13.584
that’s what it is wisdom, wisdom,
all the time, wisdom.

01:30:13.784 --> 01:30:20.557
Wise man is never cunning, never sharp.
Is something I cannot describe also.

01:30:20.757 --> 01:30:25.457
And who is the wisest of all is Shri
Ganesha, who is the embodiment of wisdom.

01:30:25.657 --> 01:30:28.394
Ask Him for wisdom.

01:30:28.595 --> 01:30:33.836
He gives you the wisdom to do anything,
ask Him for wisdom.

01:30:35.356 --> 01:30:39.821
Today I just think of how many Christmas
I must have passed,

01:30:40.022 --> 01:30:42.533
I’ve never talked about Christ so much,

01:30:42.734 --> 01:30:48.072
with that intimacy. Such a relationship,

01:30:48.273 --> 01:30:56.636
such a relationship of, so near and
so far - because He knew who I was.

01:30:58.331 --> 01:31:03.743
That awe, that respect, that humility,

01:31:03.943 --> 01:31:09.494
is hard to find in any disciple, even
in a disciple, in your own son!

01:31:09.695 --> 01:31:14.359
Is so close, but complete understanding.

01:31:17.898 --> 01:31:23.449
That oneness has to be developed.

01:31:23.649 --> 01:31:27.189
Gradually we are all developing it, I know,

01:31:27.389 --> 01:31:30.974
but these are the days of speed and
we have to speed up a little more

01:31:31.174 --> 01:31:34.125
in the right direction.

01:31:35.305 --> 01:31:41.826
So now, as desired by you, we have
a white Christmas outside.

01:31:42.027 --> 01:31:43.411
[Some yogis say: “Jai Shri Mataji”].

01:31:43.612 --> 01:31:51.586
Then as you have desired that “Wash me
and I shall be whiter than snow”

01:31:52.802 --> 01:31:55.781
is been blessed,

01:31:58.013 --> 01:32:02.638
think of all the nice things we have
done together

01:32:02.839 --> 01:32:07.557
and that we are going together to do it
later on:

01:32:07.758 --> 01:32:11.290
that’s how you solve your past and future
problem.

01:32:11.491 --> 01:32:17.734
And Christ came on this Earth to expand
your present.

01:32:17.968 --> 01:32:22.115
So Christ who is the present Christ,

01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.640
today, who is born in you, is to be
looked after.

01:32:30.349 --> 01:32:35.495
He’s not the Christ of the Bible, but
the Christ of your heart,

01:32:35.696 --> 01:32:40.219
which is born within you is to be
looked after.

01:32:43.373 --> 01:32:49.132
Bible is so symbolic that it will take
years and years

01:32:49.333 --> 01:32:53.876
for people to understand it,
it’s too symbolic.

01:32:54.076 --> 01:33:02.305
But at least you can understand it, but
other human beings cannot understand.

01:33:03.540 --> 01:33:06.846
So one has to only understand through
your own Spirit,

01:33:07.047 --> 01:33:12.489
that is the Christ born within you, which
must be looked after.

01:33:12.689 --> 01:33:17.906
Put Him in a very soft heart, if you
have thistles,

01:33:19.266 --> 01:33:22.047
He’s a collective being.

01:33:22.247 --> 01:33:30.594
If you affect the collectivity,
then He’s affected. Look after Him.

01:33:35.154 --> 01:33:40.104
So they say Merry Christmas is enjoyment
for joy.

01:33:40.305 --> 01:33:45.484
Out of peace comes the joy, light of joy,
happiness.

01:33:45.684 --> 01:33:50.994
I wish peace for the whole world,
for the whole nations,

01:33:51.195 --> 01:33:55.433
to understand to give up all the strives,

01:33:55.633 --> 01:34:02.211
all the false battles, for money and
for power,

01:34:02.988 --> 01:34:08.328
all wrong ideas that they are different
from each other,

01:34:08.529 --> 01:34:14.025
and come under the banner of Sahaja Yoga

01:34:14.225 --> 01:34:18.930
and enter into the Kingdom of God,

01:34:19.695 --> 01:34:24.677
where they are invited with all respect
and love.

01:34:24.877 --> 01:34:28.803
I wish peace to all of them, to all
the countries,

01:34:29.003 --> 01:34:38.141
all the human beings, in their families,
in their hearts, with their children.

01:34:40.095 --> 01:34:48.658
With all of them, let there be peace,
let their heart emit peace,

01:34:48.859 --> 01:34:58.586
their tongues speak with peace,
their eyes see nothing but peace.

01:35:02.706 --> 01:35:07.847
All this has to change, tremendous change
has to take place,

01:35:08.047 --> 01:35:11.651
the whole universe has to take
a different turn.

01:35:11.851 --> 01:35:17.321
All that is hatred, hateful, ugly,
has to vanish,

01:35:17.521 --> 01:35:21.666
and the peace has to prevail, which is
not the peace of the dead

01:35:21.867 --> 01:35:27.336
but peace of the living, that has to come,
of the wise.

01:35:28.057 --> 01:35:32.242
I bless all of you to be the channels
of that peace,

01:35:32.443 --> 01:35:38.767
to be beautiful channels of that peace,
to be glorious channels of that peace,

01:35:38.967 --> 01:35:45.552
to be great children of your Mother,
who is so proud of you.

01:35:45.753 --> 01:35:48.750
May God bless you.

01:37:10.865 --> 01:37:12.562
There’s a mantra for the Goddess:

01:37:12.762 --> 01:37:17.276
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita":

01:37:17.477 --> 01:37:24.119
Oh Goddess who resides through all
this creation created,

01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:28.818
all that is created, as peace.

01:37:29.661 --> 01:37:35.932
So you have to seek peace that is
your Mother.

01:37:38.375 --> 01:37:44.438
We all say that mantra. Gavin, you say it:

01:37:44.639 --> 01:37:48.017
"Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

01:37:48.218 --> 01:37:51.060
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:37:51.241 --> 01:37:57.529
You say it once and then they should
say it thrice. It’s a prayer.

01:37:57.730 --> 01:38:04.189
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

01:38:04.390 --> 01:38:11.814
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:38:12.015 --> 01:38:18.863
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

01:38:19.064 --> 01:38:26.106
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:38:26.307 --> 01:38:32.710
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
shanti rupena samsthita,

01:38:32.926 --> 01:38:40.454
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:38:50.518 --> 01:38:56.154
And then another one is kshama rupena
samsthita, this is the mantra  because

01:38:56.355 --> 01:39:00.890
the peace can come only through
humility and forgiveness, “kshama”.

01:39:01.091 --> 01:39:06.715
That’s why Christ is kshama. You say
that for Christ.

01:39:06.995 --> 01:39:13.156
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

01:39:13.357 --> 01:39:19.609
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:39:19.810 --> 01:39:25.939
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

01:39:26.140 --> 01:39:31.747
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:39:31.948 --> 01:39:37.885
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu,
kshama rupena samsthita,

01:39:38.086 --> 01:39:45.205
namastasye, namastasye, namastasye,
namoh namaha."

01:39:53.332 --> 01:39:57.192
Despite that, Agnyas are catching.

01:40:00.573 --> 01:40:03.836
Now can you take out Agnya? Those
who are feeling hurt,

01:40:04.037 --> 01:40:08.117
please give up your Agnyas now,
can you put your finger

01:40:08.364 --> 01:40:14.753
here for Agnya? Here. Good for the Jews.

01:40:48.631 --> 01:40:51.794
Hmm. Better?

01:41:09.342 --> 01:41:12.919
So now all this is too much for Christmas,

01:41:13.120 --> 01:41:15.877
at the most you can wash My hands
and this and that,

01:41:16.078 --> 01:41:20.190
you can sing something and you can
have little puja, that’s all.

01:41:20.391 --> 01:41:22.272
For Me the puja is over, if you can get a…

01:41:22.473 --> 01:41:26.788
you could just wash My hands
[and that’s it? Not clearly audible].

01:41:36.562 --> 01:41:43.130
Now. All these presents are to be
opened near the tree or something,

01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:47.646
this is the tree, tree of life. Present.

01:41:47.847 --> 01:41:50.643
Is giver of everything, giver of all
the gifts,

01:41:50.844 --> 01:41:54.527
is this tree of life, is the Kundalini,

01:41:54.728 --> 01:41:58.181
so symbolic, you see? So symbolic.

01:41:58.382 --> 01:42:03.551
The egg of Easter, this tree of, I mean
it’s so symbolic.

01:42:03.752 --> 01:42:08.667
I wish your Kundalinis were as beautiful
as that tree.

01:42:12.883 --> 01:42:15.938
Giver of all the gifts.

01:42:17.312 --> 01:42:21.189
Is called as Kalpataru, in Sanskrit.

01:42:23.230 --> 01:42:27.526
Alright, so, we can do that washing…
Gavin: Just getting water.

01:42:27.727 --> 01:42:32.342
Shri Mataji: Of the hands.
Sahaja Yogi: He’s just bringing the water.

01:42:32.572 --> 01:42:35.835
Shri Mataji: Is there a towel, or…?

01:42:39.848 --> 01:42:42.493
Shri Mataji: … way, isn’t it?

01:42:42.699 --> 01:42:46.139
I mean, if you tell somebody “Don’t put
your fingers there”, they won’t listen.

01:42:46.340 --> 01:42:52.650
But once it is burnt, then they know,
wisdom comes in, through experience.

01:42:52.851 --> 01:42:57.409
But now [they don’t have?] innate.
[Unclear]

01:43:02.613 --> 01:43:06.359
[Aside to Gavin] Yes, just wash first
of all.

01:43:21.361 --> 01:43:25.908
Look at that. Hm. Ganges.

01:43:26.109 --> 01:43:29.808
River Thames has behaved so far,
so far.

01:43:30.009 --> 01:43:34.502
I hope so, she behaves even when
I go away.

01:43:34.883 --> 01:43:39.295
Should we put it somewhere?
[Yogi: Put it in that…]

01:43:39.496 --> 01:43:45.585
She was very furious, you know?
Very furious she was.

01:43:46.977 --> 01:43:56.040
She is a standing danger. I must say.
For the sinful, be careful.

01:43:58.542 --> 01:44:02.922
All the polish of the house and everything
like that .

01:44:03.123 --> 01:44:07.737
Today I was polishing symbolically.

01:44:08.303 --> 01:44:14.154
Ah, now. First of all we’ll wash and then
we’ll do it, all right?

01:44:15.191 --> 01:44:21.654
All right. Bring it, the… no, I think
I’ll have now the ghee.

01:44:27.036 --> 01:44:30.395
Should take this quite a lot, keep it
with them

01:44:30.596 --> 01:44:35.931
and take it at least seven days,
as a medicine. This is very good.

01:44:36.132 --> 01:44:41.452
For all those who have Void problems,
specially for [voiders?].

01:44:47.499 --> 01:44:53.132
Linda, I’ll have time now, once this is
over then you can come and see Me,

01:44:53.333 --> 01:44:56.699
and then we’ll discuss about other things,
all right?

01:44:58.432 --> 01:45:02.697
Now, what should we do?
Gavin: He’s just getting ghee now.

01:45:03.056 --> 01:45:05.416
It’s been warmed.

01:45:12.020 --> 01:45:13.974
Shri Mataji: You don’t have anything
for Aarti and all that,

01:45:14.175 --> 01:45:17.198
I’ll bring this time when I go there.

01:45:18.691 --> 01:45:22.925
If I save some money. Yes.

01:45:23.775 --> 01:45:28.540
You know, the letter was not shown
to Modi.

01:45:33.303 --> 01:45:36.559
Letter you give up.

01:45:56.812 --> 01:46:00.241
This is ghee?
Yogini: Yes, Mother.

01:46:00.442 --> 01:46:05.425
Shri Mataji: This is ghee! So much!
Out of proportion it is, I mean.

01:46:05.626 --> 01:46:09.071
It’s too much softening.

01:46:11.502 --> 01:46:16.268
All right, give Me little bit now, some.
Just a wee bit.

01:46:16.469 --> 01:46:21.473
As it is you all have liver, so you don’t
need ghee.

01:46:24.506 --> 01:46:26.827
It’s all right.

01:46:29.193 --> 01:46:32.087
Now pour some water.

01:46:36.905 --> 01:46:41.017
Good for cleaning the nose of all
the people who have sinus…

01:46:41.218 --> 01:46:45.646
the ghee, but not for eating, eh?

01:46:57.326 --> 01:47:01.010
Now. Little bit now of another thing,
whatever it is.

01:47:17.051 --> 01:47:19.902
Put the whole thing.

01:47:26.253 --> 01:47:29.310
Again some water.

01:47:42.024 --> 01:47:44.215
Now.

01:47:47.777 --> 01:47:51.041
Milk has to be more. Madhu,
madhu,

01:47:51.242 --> 01:47:54.488
you get madhu first, madhu means…

01:47:54.903 --> 01:47:58.428
Milk will be more than this. Yes.

01:48:25.457 --> 01:48:28.626
Gavin: Shall I put milk next?

01:48:28.827 --> 01:48:32.742
Shri Mataji: Yes, milk, then. And more
milk than…

01:48:38.369 --> 01:48:42.587
Gavin: …sugar.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:48:53.801 --> 01:48:56.902
Milk. Need for more milk, I think.

01:49:16.653 --> 01:49:21.356
More. Here.

01:49:23.709 --> 01:49:26.717
Yes, it’s all right.

01:49:43.175 --> 01:49:46.177
Not too much sugar.

01:50:07.430 --> 01:50:11.298
Not to feel guilty, for Heaven’s sake.

01:50:13.355 --> 01:50:17.139
Not to feel guilty at all, left -
left Vishuddhi catching.

01:50:17.340 --> 01:50:20.693
Don’t think! In My presence you are
not supposed to think at all.

01:50:20.894 --> 01:50:25.776
Just don’t think. Don’t feel guilty.

01:50:27.103 --> 01:50:33.148
Catching, still.
[Aside] Good, thank you.

01:50:40.597 --> 01:50:44.376
Yogi: She’s posing!
Shri Mataji: She’s posing!

01:50:54.703 --> 01:51:00.538
Look at her. Wrapped up in the sari.

01:51:01.627 --> 01:51:04.575
Fitting in great, herself [unclear].

01:51:05.489 --> 01:51:08.842
Gavin: Just matches her eyes.
Shri Mataji: Eh?

01:51:09.043 --> 01:51:14.409
Gavin: The sari just matches her eyes.
Shri Mataji: You see? Just see [indistinct].

01:51:17.443 --> 01:51:20.903
It’s a dignified thing, you know,
sari is very dignified.

01:51:21.104 --> 01:51:24.629
Now. All right.

01:51:44.835 --> 01:51:49.392
Very nice people. Very sensible.

01:51:54.084 --> 01:51:58.274
Gavin, in your list you must put this also.

01:52:00.141 --> 01:52:04.720
If you tell this list to Me, there,
who is coming gives you.

01:52:04.921 --> 01:52:08.519
Who are coming to India out of you?

01:52:12.131 --> 01:52:14.397
Here?

01:52:23.445 --> 01:52:28.537
Now, those who are coming should
get this list

01:52:28.738 --> 01:52:35.313
of a few things that you need,
essential ones.

01:52:35.514 --> 01:52:40.310
I don’t find that thing with which you used
to give Me water, is it here or not?

01:52:40.511 --> 01:52:42.807
With the spoon and all that.

01:52:43.008 --> 01:52:45.142
Gavin: I must check it with Marcus
afterwards. Shri Mataji: Marcus?

01:52:45.343 --> 01:52:47.851
Marcus: Yes, Mother.
Shri Mataji: You’ve got that spoon and…

01:52:48.052 --> 01:52:51.131
Marcus: Yes, Mother. Shri Mataji: That
you have got. Marcus: Yes.

01:52:52.277 --> 01:52:56.898
Shri Mataji: All right [speaks aside in a
low voice. Sounds like: there’s the spoon].

01:53:08.464 --> 01:53:13.202
This one is very good because it is not
hard wood.

01:55:13.121 --> 01:55:16.615
Yogi: Christmas… [indistinct].

01:55:41.089 --> 01:55:47.980
Shri Mataji: Now, just put some red
on my hand. Red [Kumkum? Unclear]

01:55:52.964 --> 01:55:57.816
Shri Mataji: I will. Gavin: Our Mother,
You are the Counsellor

01:55:58.017 --> 01:56:02.474
who was promised by Christ.
Shri Mataji: I am.

01:56:02.675 --> 01:56:06.829
Gavin: You make us become our
own knowledge.

01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:14.925
Our Mother, You are the Redeemer,
who was promised by Christ.

01:56:16.523 --> 01:56:19.946
You have given us our second birth.

01:56:23.168 --> 01:56:30.535
Our Mother, You are the fulfillment
of every prophecy and every prayer.

01:56:32.903 --> 01:56:35.693
Our Mother, You are the wholesomeness,

01:56:35.894 --> 01:56:40.167
by which all wrongs are cleansed.

01:56:43.421 --> 01:56:47.609
Our Mother, You are the right
discrimination

01:56:47.810 --> 01:56:52.204
by which we have received enlightenment.

01:56:55.579 --> 01:56:58.768
Our Mother, You are the integration,

01:56:58.969 --> 01:57:04.232
by You God’s whole creation has been
threaded together.

01:57:09.741 --> 01:57:13.836
We bow to You who are auspiciousness;

01:57:18.710 --> 01:57:22.163
we praise You who are Love;

01:57:24.522 --> 01:57:29.056
we give thanks to You who are compassion;

01:57:31.176 --> 01:57:41.147
we prostrate before You who are all-knowing,
all-seeing and all-forgiving.

01:57:43.043 --> 01:57:45.882
We are Your children:

01:57:47.797 --> 01:57:51.358
let us never be separated from You,

01:57:51.559 --> 01:57:57.197
whether by Your illusion, or by our
own limitations.

01:57:59.150 --> 01:58:02.607
Give us strength of Spirit

01:58:05.918 --> 01:58:12.329
and to the world give peace. Aum.

01:58:13.363 --> 01:58:15.827
Yogis: Amen.

01:58:42.961 --> 01:58:49.112
Shri Mataji: Let your life be fragrant
by My blessings,

01:58:52.876 --> 01:58:55.747
by My love,

01:58:58.715 --> 01:59:02.071
by My concern,

01:59:02.882 --> 01:59:06.788
and the pride that I have for you all.

01:59:33.570 --> 01:59:36.399
May God bless you.

01:59:42.526 --> 01:59:46.203
Yogini: … and it’s called “Mother God”.
Shri Mataji: Who?

01:59:46.404 --> 01:59:52.117
Yogini: It’s called “Mother God”. Shri
Mataji: “Mother God”. Yogini: “Mother God”.

02:02:55.773 --> 02:02:58.027
Shri Mataji: Oh.

02:03:17.755 --> 02:03:23.572
Sang [you?] with such a heart. Everybody
was, everybody’s heart was singing with you.

02:03:23.773 --> 02:03:28.177
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

02:03:34.809 --> 02:03:37.442
These songs should be recorded
and should be sent to India.

02:03:37.643 --> 02:03:42.073
They would be very happy, you see,
to have these songs.

02:03:51.048 --> 02:03:53.277
Very beautiful. Who wrote it?
Yogini: Hugo wrote it, Mother.

02:03:53.518 --> 02:03:56.526
Shri Mataji: Eh? Yogini: Hugo wrote it.
Shri Mataji: Hugo. Yogini: Hugo did that.

02:03:56.727 --> 02:04:00.615
Shri Mataji: Congratulations.
Give him a hand.

02:04:16.080 --> 02:04:18.842
Beautiful.

02:04:19.779 --> 02:04:22.069
Integration is so important, you see.

02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:24.888
Somebody has to write, somebody
has to compose,

02:04:25.089 --> 02:04:28.674
somebody has to sing and somebody
has to listen.
