00:16.960 --> 00:24.080
So, it's rather warm. All right. As you please,  

00:24.080 --> 00:39.440
where do I keep this? That flower. You turn 
it off. What flowers? Yes. Beautiful. Now,

00:41.200 --> 00:45.760
If you can get my handkerchief from my purses and  

00:45.760 --> 00:54.960
my spectacles. Hm. Ask Marsha to 
bring mother's purse and place.

00:54.960 --> 00:59.817
today I was thinking

01:11.610 --> 01:19.818
of talking or telling you about the sahaja 
culture.

01:20.788 --> 01:24.728
Now we have formed the dharma, Vishwa Dharma.

01:27.707 --> 01:29.631
But it must have a culture.  

01:30.936 --> 01:33.182
So far in all the religions

01:35.293 --> 01:38.350
there is no combination of religion and culture.

01:38.350 --> 01:39.369
No religion has.

01:40.973 --> 01:45.472
That's why everywhere 
you find different cultures.

01:45.472 --> 01:47.231
Now what is  a culture?

01:47.231 --> 01:52.640
First of all let us see what is 
a culture. So the culture is the pattern of

01:52.640 --> 01:55.094
behavior we have with others.

01:55.094 --> 01:58.921
So the culture of 
the spirit doesn't change.

01:58.921 --> 02:04.188
It's universal and is higher than any other culture.

02:04.188 --> 02:08.475
Apart from that it 
integrates all the essences of all the cultures.

02:13.474 --> 02:18.991
So it emanates from the spirit. Now, spirit 
has two sides.

02:19.404 --> 02:22.523
One side which you see, the another you don't see. Like the moon.

02:23.866 --> 02:27.022
The side you see is outside with other people,  

02:28.480 --> 02:36.652
other Sahaja Yogis, other people, other societies, which are not yourself, absolutely.

02:38.032 --> 02:44.156
The other side you don’t see is the relationship with God Almighty, relationship with your Mother.

02:47.840 --> 02:55.904
If the other side is not all right, the 
behavioral side outside could become artificial,  

02:56.240 --> 03:04.581
could become crooked and not Sahaj. So it’s the other way round than any other culture.

03:10.736 --> 03:19.044
But if you want to know the Sahaja culture, you have to know your Mother, and you have
to know God Almighty.

03:19.342 --> 03:25.936
The relationship between your 
Mother and the God Almighty has to be absolutely perfect.

03:26.310 --> 03:27.459
Then there's no problem.

03:30.000 --> 03:37.389
But that, the relationship, if it is not all right, you
cannot have artificial Sahaj culture.

03:37.389 --> 03:43.511
That is one thing for sure. Artificial Sahaj culture is
not all right.

03:44.294 --> 03:54.093
But to have the culture, first of all, culture is developed through meditation, by facing yourself.

03:56.369 --> 04:03.835
First of all you should face yourself, how you feel about your Mother and about God Almighty.

04:04.880 --> 04:08.518
Now if you are surrendered how do you 
see the surrendering in a person? 

04:08.704 --> 04:11.384
You see, it has
one side, and the another is the expression.

04:13.995 --> 04:16.397
Say a person who is surrendered

04:18.400 --> 04:23.915
doesn’t talk much to Me, doesn’t talk, [he] listens,
doesn’t talk.

04:24.325 --> 04:26.325
Common sense, [he] listens.

04:29.659 --> 04:36.853
Even people who are very good, I’ve seen
when I’m talking, they’ll put in their own words in between. 

04:38.121 --> 04:40.078
People who are very good,
I should say.

04:40.936 --> 04:42.503
So the surrendering is not full.

04:44.182 --> 04:48.043
Surrendering has to be to that point that you shouldn’t worry.

04:50.712 --> 04:55.143
If one can understand that, then you will not try to organize Me.

04:55.777 --> 04:58.147
You can just tell Me,
“We have to leave at this time.”

04:58.408 --> 05:01.415
But if I don’t have to leave, I will not leave whatever
you may do.

05:03.840 --> 05:07.366
Spirit is never upset, never excited,  

05:08.000 --> 05:11.896
never hurries, and never is what you call that
“go-go” business [laughter].

05:15.142 --> 05:21.564
Like now, we had to go to the airport. You’ll find everybody
was like an aeroplane – round, round, round, round.

05:22.123 --> 05:23.370
What has happened?

05:24.042 --> 05:30.746
The whole thing is, all these excitements and all these things come to us because we are outside.

05:31.668 --> 05:37.121
But if you are one with your Spirit you are absolutely calm, absolutely calm,

05:37.531 --> 05:40.800
“All right,
we have to go, all right, we’ll reach there. Doesn’t matter.”

05:40.987 --> 05:43.564
Why are you saving time? For what are you saving time?

05:46.800 --> 05:51.142
So we miss the present, and that’s one thing Spirit never misses.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.142
It’s always in the present.

05:53.760 --> 05:58.002
That's the reality about it now. Now, 
present moment, what are we doing

06:00.800 --> 06:07.173
In a very calm way, witness it. Witness yourself, now, witness yourself. “Where is my mind going?”

06:08.276 --> 06:10.320
Now somebody who has to cook must be thinking,

06:10.320 --> 06:12.149
“Oh, I have to get this, I have to get
that”, everything.

06:13.492 --> 06:18.505
Once you start saying that “I have to do it”, you’ll never be able to do it that way.

06:18.505 --> 06:22.491
But you said, “All right, just now I’m in meditation.”

06:25.333 --> 06:27.272
Every moment. “I am in meditation.”

06:28.403 --> 06:31.474
Everything will walk up to you, even matter,

06:33.600 --> 06:35.948
and you’ll get the right things at the right
place.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.720
You’ll meet right people at the right place.

06:48.427 --> 06:53.513
So when you are so much tied down with your watch,

06:53.887 --> 06:56.699
that means you are not tied
down with your Spirit. down with your spirit.

06:57.893 --> 07:02.094
So a Sahaja Yogi, if he sees watch, then he’s not a Sahaja Yogi.

07:05.840 --> 07:12.448
But the other side could be that the Sahaja Yogis are never in time where they have to be.

07:16.080 --> 07:16.947
now

07:20.080 --> 07:26.475
to take for granted things, as you say, take for granted, that’s not the way Sahaja Yoga is.

07:26.475 --> 07:29.611
You have to be alert, alert, absolutely alert.

07:30.581 --> 07:32.342
If you are alert, immediately you’ll know

07:32.342 --> 07:33.977
“I have to go now at this time.

07:34.201 --> 07:35.111
I have to do it.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.809
I have to get this thing now.”

07:41.301 --> 07:43.525
If you have to
miss something, you are supposed to miss it.

07:43.719 --> 07:44.802
That’s what it is.

07:44.802 --> 07:52.083
So, there’s a beautiful thing written down, like they say, “Jai sei rakhahu tase hi rahun”

07:52.083 --> 07:55.040
– “The way You keep me, the way I am, will be happy.”

07:55.555 --> 08:00.957
So, satisfaction towards your Self, your Spirit, is important.

08:08.480 --> 08:18.341
So for a person who is imbibed with the culture of Spirit, the Sahaj culture, impresses others

08:18.341 --> 08:26.433
by his calmness and relaxed attitude.Relaxation never means lethargy, by any chance.

08:27.439 --> 08:35.327
It doesn’t mean lethargy. Lethargy is against relaxation. 
A person who is relaxed cannot become lethargic.

08:35.327 --> 08:38.698
“Relaxed” means
a person who is alert and calm.

08:40.000 --> 08:45.630
These two things for human beings is an impossibility
[laughter],

08:47.359 --> 08:49.359
because if they are alert,

08:50.740 --> 08:52.937
if they are alert then they are not calm.

08:53.422 --> 08:59.340
If they are
unhappy, sad, then they think they are very, very calm.

09:00.608 --> 09:03.669
So this is one of the things one has to remember,

09:03.669 --> 09:10.849
that you have to witness yourself all the time. Not to condemn yourself, but witness.

09:10.849 --> 09:14.691
Now I said the word “witness” means “detached”. Now what happens with this?

09:15.624 --> 09:19.034
when
you start condemning yourself, you miss every good point.

09:19.034 --> 09:22.799
You are a Spirit now, you are no more an ordinary human being,

09:22.799 --> 09:25.388
so you have no business to condemn yourself,

09:25.836 --> 09:29.254
or to degrade yourself, or in any way to feel unhappy.

09:31.082 --> 09:33.280
No way.Past is past.

09:33.280 --> 09:39.154
What happened a moment before is finished. “Now I am going to rise. Now I am going to rise.”

09:44.480 --> 09:52.983
So a person who has a Sahaj culture is not only spontaneous, but is inspired,

09:53.515 --> 09:55.483
is an inspired personality.

09:56.490 --> 10:02.854
A person who is of that kind, an inspired visionary,

10:04.309 --> 10:08.280
then other
people get impressed by such a person that,

10:08.347 --> 10:14.202
“See, there’s a man who is inspired, who
talks in an inspired way,

10:14.538 --> 10:18.011
in a way that is something very different from others.”

10:18.198 --> 10:20.288
Something new he says,

10:22.816 --> 10:26.810
new, that is nourishing. This is Sahaj culture,

10:26.997 --> 10:29.780
in which you recognize a realized soul,

10:32.279 --> 10:34.801
the dignity of a realized soul.

10:35.840 --> 10:40.607
So when it comes to relating to others, first and foremost are Sahaja Yogis.

10:42.587 --> 10:51.438
So the culture of Sahaj is to give. Give, and give, and give, and never ask for a reward.

10:53.104 --> 10:59.537
Never thinks, “What I have to get”. After all, you have got the highest that anybody could get.

11:02.560 --> 11:07.235
They said the three heights a human being can achieve in spirituality,

11:07.235 --> 11:11.834
which you all got
in no time. It’s called as

11:14.150 --> 11:17.666
salokya, samipya, sanidya.

11:18.166 --> 11:22.583
You have got all these three. In one incarnation you’ve got it.

11:24.038 --> 11:29.731
When Gods incarnated before, nobody knew that they were Gods.

11:35.462 --> 11:39.095
So even they got it, they never knew.

11:41.440 --> 11:48.194
So the three blessings that a saint is promised,

11:48.363 --> 11:54.626
you’ve got all of them. But because you’ve got them, you don’t understand.

11:56.960 --> 11:59.991
You take it for granted. There’s no shraddha.

12:00.991 --> 12:06.669
With this experience there should be tremendous faith.

12:10.160 --> 12:17.509
Faith is a thing
that resides between Me and you, in between. 

12:19.076 --> 12:22.620
Is we can say, the ocean of joy that is in
between.

12:22.620 --> 12:28.171
Whatever I emit to you is that shraddha,

12:28.646 --> 12:36.517
and when you are drenched into it, the joy of
that shraddha

12:39.430 --> 12:42.743
makes everything so sahaj.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.814
But for that you must open your hearts.

12:56.038 --> 13:02.738
A Sahaja Yogi who is secretive, who is insular,
who is jealous,

13:03.840 --> 13:08.278
who separates himself from others is no good.

13:09.442 --> 13:13.243
Open your heart! Give away your things. Doesn't matter!

13:16.748 --> 13:23.616
Matter has only one value, that it can communicate
your Sahaj culture.

13:24.474 --> 13:29.514
Now if you become unhappy and serious, you are very unkind to yourself and to others.

13:30.240 --> 13:35.906
Anybody who is a serious person, sits with a serious face, know that he is not a Sahaja Yogi at all.

13:37.920 --> 13:42.204
They should be bubbling with laughter, joy all the time.

13:42.391 --> 13:44.167
That’s how a person should be,

13:44.167 --> 13:46.503
and don’t worry what others have to say.

13:47.682 --> 13:50.709
You see, the
culture where people are just glum like this,

13:51.077 --> 13:54.658
is the same as the people where they are
frivolous.

13:55.777 --> 13:58.710
both things are nonsensical, has no meaning.

13:58.710 --> 14:03.400
You have to be natural, and natural
everything is always bubbling with joy.

14:06.300 --> 14:14.798
And a message. And a message. These flowers are the message of My coming, writ large on them.

14:18.240 --> 14:24.000
So a person who is a Sahaj culture man should emit that message to others,

14:24.000 --> 14:27.846
people
should see, “Oh, this is the man. He is the sahaja fellow.”

14:28.406 --> 14:30.000
You can see that clearly.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.394
The comfort of the Spirit is the thing we have lost, 

14:37.617 --> 14:43.795
and those who seek the comfort of
the Spirit are Sahaja Yogis, not otherwise.

14:45.287 --> 14:47.378
Comfort of the Spirit comes in giving.

14:48.379 --> 14:51.057
I have put you inside My body, do you know that?

14:51.654 --> 14:55.085
You are part and parcel of My body,
you are the cells in My body.

14:56.652 --> 15:03.022
And when you catch, I also catch; not catch, but I really
get the pain, but I clear it.

15:06.219 --> 15:12.820
In the same way, I have given you powers.Every power I have, I have given you.

15:15.835 --> 15:22.642
But you have to develop it and you have to be adventurous.

15:24.577 --> 15:27.145
It’s surprising, for a Western person,

15:28.227 --> 15:31.584
it is very important that it should be economical,
surprising,

15:31.584 --> 15:35.072
affluent people think more of saving money than the people who are poor.

15:38.299 --> 15:43.169
So with the affluence miserliness grows, and money-orientation.

15:43.729 --> 15:48.195
In India also I’ve seen people who get little more money than the rest become very money-oriented.

15:51.851 --> 16:02.491
You must know that your Kundalinis were not raised with just your own Kundalini,

16:02.491 --> 16:08.898
but something that is working it out. Something very tremendous, a big organisation.

16:11.920 --> 16:14.274
You can’t see it, it is microscopic.

16:14.796 --> 16:18.400
You must know, nobody got realisation like that, did they?

16:19.056 --> 16:23.039
Thousands getting realisation,
what’s happening? There must be something about…

16:24.046 --> 16:25.735
Now how can you

16:26.406 --> 16:31.460
tell anything to such an organisation? They don’t like it. They know
it.

16:31.654 --> 16:36.970
Actually they are the ones who know, not the English. They know what is to be done.

16:37.567 --> 16:43.348
So your relationship with Me acts as your culture.

16:44.640 --> 16:55.033
So it is a Mother’s cult, you can call it, is the Mother’s culture. How we are connected with our Mother.

16:56.518 --> 17:05.144
So in that culture, you see, you really thrive and
you become extremely a happy person, a joyous person.

17:08.016 --> 17:08.665
and the

17:12.139 --> 17:15.074
expression of such a person is so different,

17:15.894 --> 17:22.479
because such a person, as I told
you, rises above and sees the problems of others,

17:22.479 --> 17:26.328
the decadence of the society, sees
all the problems of the world.

17:29.499 --> 17:32.925
Not only that, but knows the solutions.

17:43.200 --> 17:48.743
So in this culture of ours we are not bothered about superficial things.

17:49.702 --> 17:54.554
What we are
bothered about is our inner cleanliness,

17:55.584 --> 17:57.054
inner beauty,

17:57.763 --> 18:00.225
but that doesn’t mean that you
should move about

18:00.225 --> 18:03.154
like primitive people, no.

18:04.683 --> 18:07.746
But if there is inner beauty, then outer beauty comes in.

18:08.695 --> 18:15.525
So a person who is a Sahaja Yogi has to be an extremely neat and a clean person,

18:15.525 --> 18:18.923
but not to tell others, but should be himself or herself.

18:19.632 --> 18:23.527
That’s one of the things are very
important, because others will see you

18:23.840 --> 18:26.915
like loonies, who is going to believe you?

18:26.915 --> 18:30.967
So the one effect is from the Mother, you take from the Source, for what?

18:32.942 --> 18:36.813
To be that illuminated quality, in you,

18:36.813 --> 18:40.000
so that others see you as something great

18:41.532 --> 18:44.108
and adore you, worship you.

18:45.675 --> 18:50.610
This is this far we have come, now, how your personality should be.

18:50.871 --> 18:54.243
But now, when
you are dealing with others,

18:54.691 --> 18:59.175
know that they are human beings made by God, not by
Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

19:01.894 --> 19:06.320
And they will be tomorrow’s Sahaja Yogis, may be higher
Sahaja Yogis than you.

19:06.780 --> 19:12.406
So when we are dealing with others also, talk to them in a gentle way.

19:13.189 --> 19:15.189
Be kind to them. 

19:16.010 --> 19:20.221
So you are not given this power to be

19:22.571 --> 19:27.069
abrupt or to be arrogant with others, not given.

19:27.069 --> 19:30.371
Now all such people are coming down,

19:30.371 --> 19:38.400
calming down because they see that what
helps is your gentle, kindly, firm attitude.

19:39.100 --> 19:42.010
Only after Sahaja Yoga you can combine all these qualities.

19:43.166 --> 19:45.035
You’ll be firm, you’ll be alert,

19:45.371 --> 19:52.631
you’ll be gentle and compassionate, smiling, but not making fun of others.

19:54.198 --> 19:55.780
So
then you become

19:57.531 --> 19:59.852
a personality who is alert:

20:00.449 --> 20:05.066
to see what is the reaction they are
having on others, this is very important to be seen.

20:06.633 --> 20:11.484
So now you start witnessing
others. What is your reaction on others?

20:11.484 --> 20:20.662
So the reflection on others, how they reflect about you also is very important, and you have to be alert.

20:23.264 --> 20:26.572
Suddenly you say something, and everybody disappears. 

20:26.572 --> 20:34.088
You must know they are not yet Sahaja Yogis, they are to be brought in, so you have to very carefully bring them around.

20:36.662 --> 20:44.448
Then with Sahaja Yogis, among yourselves how you
behave is extremely important for others to see.

20:46.723 --> 20:52.552
We must cherish each other’s
company, we must cherish.

20:53.254 --> 21:00.187
You must cherish their companies, because it’s such a great thing to have somebody who understands you, your Spirit,

21:00.187 --> 21:03.083
and they have the Spirit. Such a great thing.

21:03.217 --> 21:05.661
How can you be unkind to each other?

21:08.459 --> 21:14.383
That hurts Me the most of all. And the first
thing and the foremost thing you have to give Me

21:15.129 --> 21:19.691
is congenial, beautiful, loving

21:21.482 --> 21:23.556
group,

21:26.242 --> 21:27.999
that they love each other.

21:27.999 --> 21:33.778
If that’s achieved that you really love, beyond your personal considerations.

21:40.277 --> 21:45.175
I mean, of course, in Sahaja Yoga there are now not many people who try to make money,

21:45.809 --> 21:49.308
but try to make comfort for themselves.

21:51.323 --> 21:57.500
In the culture of Sahaja Yoga we have to have a full imbibement

21:58.358 --> 22:00.462
bubbling through our nerves,

22:00.798 --> 22:02.638
the sense of chastity.

22:04.317 --> 22:07.977
That is a must, whether you like it or not.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.679
There should
be no bad intentions

22:13.164 --> 22:15.797
about any other person,

22:18.670 --> 22:23.113
of relationships which are not pure.

22:25.649 --> 22:34.512
Absolutely pure relationships, pure eyes without any adultery, adulteration I would
call it.

22:35.109 --> 22:36.544
Clean eyes

22:38.260 --> 22:41.754
is the basic of Sahaja Yoga.

22:45.969 --> 22:48.064
Steadfast clean eyes,

22:49.481 --> 22:53.726
because your eyes are
very powerful. You don’t know how powerful they are.

22:57.958 --> 23:01.194
So to make it that way,

23:01.530 --> 23:08.260
to
practice, move your attention inward and towards the Sahasrara.

23:09.044 --> 23:10.000
You can.

23:11.806 --> 23:13.239
With your eyes you suck in.

23:14.456 --> 23:16.382
Even by looking at Me

23:17.091 --> 23:19.237
with the shraddha, with the joy,

23:19.237 --> 23:21.769
you just suck it inside, My image.

23:21.769 --> 23:25.095
Put it on your Sahasrara, put it in your heart,

23:28.480 --> 23:34.747
you can do it. It’s very joy-giving.
When you put it in the Sahasrara,

23:35.531 --> 23:37.386
then you get the knowledge.

23:37.767 --> 23:41.281
When you put it in your heart, you get the joy;

23:41.840 --> 23:49.717
and when you put it on your liver, then
you get the power of action.

23:50.314 --> 23:52.314
So in the culture

23:53.396 --> 23:54.666
of Sahaj,

23:56.870 --> 24:03.246
because the Spirit is the dignity, is the majesty, is the glory
of God,

24:06.267 --> 24:09.053
you have to judge yourself.

24:09.053 --> 24:15.147
“Did I say something which is not respecting my
Spirit?

24:16.139 --> 24:18.583
Did I do something

24:20.000 --> 24:23.864
that is not glorious?”  We don’t live with choices.

24:24.647 --> 24:27.371
We live with whatever we get it,

24:27.371 --> 24:29.243
and there is dignity in that.

24:29.743 --> 24:32.131
If you start doing choices, it’s stupid.

24:34.033 --> 24:38.033
Choices are not there in Sahaja Yoga, remember this word very clearly.

24:38.631 --> 24:44.560
Choices of this, choices of that, I don’t like it, I like that. This is not good, that is not good.

24:46.544 --> 24:51.111
Because we need everything on the level of vibrations,

24:53.462 --> 24:54.968
then the choice is coming.

24:56.572 --> 24:58.825
Like, if the vibrations are not good,

24:58.825 --> 25:00.739
we’ll not say it,but we’ll not have it.

25:04.433 --> 25:07.956
But not
question of whether green or red or yellow or white.

25:13.750 --> 25:19.899
So you have to understand that when you are a Sahaj personality,

25:20.366 --> 25:25.232
you have your own
dignity. These things do not give dignity to you.

25:27.584 --> 25:29.416
You give them dignity.

25:32.251 --> 25:37.863
But that doesn’t
mean tomorrow you come like a clown, or like a limbo on your nose.

25:40.544 --> 25:45.661
When you become dignified, you will wear always something that is dignified.

25:47.173 --> 25:51.284
You will do all that is dignified. Is automatically you become dignified.

25:53.205 --> 25:54.765
It’s nothing artificial.

26:00.285 --> 26:04.062
A person who is money-oriented cannot have dignity,

26:04.658 --> 26:06.277
because you see him like a
beggar.

26:06.277 --> 26:08.151
See, if there’s money-orientation is too much,  

26:08.151 --> 26:11.509
he comes down to that level, you can
see it, there cannot be dignity in that.

26:11.509 --> 26:14.265
A man who is power-oriented is an idiot.

26:16.018 --> 26:17.973
He looks like an idiot.

26:18.793 --> 26:23.087
So we cannot become
idiots. All right. So we cannot be power-oriented.

26:25.984 --> 26:32.970
Self-respect is the thing. Self is your Spirit.The respect of the Spirit should give you that dignity.

26:33.343 --> 26:39.003
But in privacy you are gentle with your husband, you are gentle with your wife.

26:39.760 --> 26:42.797
So we cannot do things which embarrasses our Mother.

26:44.177 --> 26:50.582
Once you start knowing that,
“This will embarrass Mother, we can’t do this”, automatically you will be.

26:50.769 --> 26:55.134
So when it is related with Me, immediately, “What will Mother think of in me?  

26:56.662 --> 27:03.726
Is this the way to behave towards Mother?” Immediately you will get the reward, as that thing working through you,

27:07.382 --> 27:17.027
as if you become that nature. Sahaj culture is a sahaj nature. Automatically you will do it.

27:19.600 --> 27:25.244
You’ll talk in that manner, you will speak in that manner, you’ll live in that manner.

27:26.475 --> 27:29.470
We cannot be slavish, and we cannot enslave anyone.

27:31.223 --> 27:34.618
We have to cherish, even
human beings we have to cherish,

27:34.618 --> 27:41.620
because they are us. Not to despise anyone, not to
laugh at anyone.

27:48.896 --> 27:52.265
In the culture of Sahaj,

27:53.831 --> 27:56.684
you have to become an expert: expertise.

27:59.371 --> 28:03.122
Expertise comes
through your adherence to your Mother. 

28:03.458 --> 28:05.383
Expertise: you all should be an expert,

28:06.651 --> 28:10.682
and who will give you the certificate is your
Mother only – who else?

28:10.682 --> 28:12.151
I may not say so,

28:14.464 --> 28:16.484
but your Spirit will say that,

28:19.394 --> 28:20.789
and not your ego.

28:21.609 --> 28:24.593
Now, marriage. “What are we going to achieve out of marriage?”

28:25.078 --> 28:28.990
A family, house,
everybody has, even a donkey has that [laughter].

28:30.351 --> 28:31.441
What’s so great?

28:32.944 --> 28:37.013
We are going to achieve a family unit where realized souls are to be born,

28:37.013 --> 28:43.922
we are going to look after them in a proper way, and then we are going to emit that unit

28:46.496 --> 28:55.009
into this world, like a sparkling diamond set in the beautiful setting of a family,

28:55.792 --> 28:57.690
giving light
to the whole world.

28:59.592 --> 29:02.457
So one’s life should not be pointless,

29:03.211 --> 29:06.558
and talk should not be pointless,

29:08.349 --> 29:16.250
and every moment should be filled with achievements of your visions and dreams,

29:17.518 --> 29:19.241
slowly and
steadily,

29:20.882 --> 29:25.737
which is not at all difficult.

29:26.595 --> 29:31.972
If you can get rid of ego and superego, finished, that’s all – simple as that [laughter,
Shri Mataji laughs].

29:37.532 --> 29:39.300
May God bless you all.
