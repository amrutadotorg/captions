1
00:58:20,006 --> 00:58:23,894
The situation is the same as I have in my house [with so many flowers].

2
00:58:33,279 --> 00:58:36,869
All right, now you sit down.

3
00:58:47,588 --> 00:59:11,311
So, today I was explaining, in my bedroom, to some of the Sahaja Yogis how this universe is created.

4
00:59:17,882 --> 00:59:23,396
And they said, "You should tell about his to us, in the evening".

5
00:59:28,653 --> 00:59:38,008
But, after dinner, most are in digestion, is it worth it?

6
00:59:49,698 --> 00:59:55,937
Carol wanted to show off the watch that my children have given me.

7
01:00:06,833 --> 01:00:09,565
These also came in the same price.

8
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:26,178
The watch was so big, which they gave me, for that you really need a wrestler to wear.

9
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:55,203
And I saw the watch. I didn't know what to say, you see.

10
01:00:55,614 --> 01:01:03,037
There's a saying that, "You should not open the mouth of the horse. which is given to you, From the teeth."

11
01:01:12,894 --> 01:01:21,971
Because they asked me, "We are going for Guru puja and we collected some money for you in Switzerland. What should we give you?" So, I said, "Of course, in Switzerland, a watch!"

12
01:01:34,251 --> 01:01:45,367
So, they said, "What kind?" I said, "Something sensible I would like to have which you can select yourself."

13
01:01:45,490 --> 01:01:49,908
So, Antonio showed me some Italian, nice-

14
01:01:49,908 --> 01:01:51,261
Nice Swiss

15
01:01:51,261 --> 01:01:51,868
Hum?

16
01:01:51,868 --> 01:01:53,211
It was Swiss.

17
01:01:53,211 --> 01:01:55,914
Swiss! They told me Italian.

18
01:01:55,914 --> 01:01:57,914
No, that was Swiss.

19
01:01:58,545 --> 01:02:01,140
Ah! Mistake.

20
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,037
 It’s all right.

21
01:02:03,037 --> 01:02:07,891
I thought it was Italian. So, I said, "I don't want Italian, I want a Swiss watch".

22
01:02:11,320 --> 01:02:14,162
But the name was not Swiss.

23
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:15,986
I know about the name.

24
01:02:16,171 --> 01:02:17,315
What’s the name?

25
01:02:17,315 --> 01:02:18,372
Eagles.

26
01:02:18,372 --> 01:02:19,328
Eva

27
01:02:19,328 --> 01:02:22,889
Eagles. Etam

28
01:02:31,329 --> 01:02:37,350
So, I said, "Whatever money you collect accordingly, you purchase whatever you feel like.

29
01:02:37,605 --> 01:02:45,951
So, they bought a watch.  It was selected by Gavindra and actually, I did not know.

30
01:02:45,951 --> 01:02:52,809
He had not seen it properly and he told you the number and such a big watch came in, you see.

31
01:02:52,809 --> 01:03:00,025
I got a fright. It was solid gold, I know and thick, it's a solid gold.

32
01:03:16,678 --> 01:03:20,670
I meant a [inaudible], I was really shocked, but I didn't show any shock.

33
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:29,856
 I told him, "Very well" and I said, "Wonderful. You are testing things out my Left Vishudhi vibrations " everything I said. It was all false.

34
01:03:50,122 --> 01:03:57,733
Imagine, five hundred eyes on yourself, and you say something that is given to you as present.

35
01:03:58,657 --> 01:04:00,919
This is the most embarrassing position.

36
01:04:08,825 --> 01:04:15,747
 It is easy to kill the rakshasas. But to break the heart of your children like this is very difficult.

37
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:27,163
Puranas said all those things.

38
01:04:27,163 --> 01:04:32,031
But then I thought that, "Arnaud could not have bought that watch".

39
01:04:37,677 --> 01:04:47,806
Because he must have tried it on his wrist and he must have seen such big thing on his wrist. He would not buy one like that for his wife.

40
01:04:53,423 --> 01:04:57,137
So, I dared to ask him that, "Who has selected the watch?"

41
01:05:02,104 --> 01:05:04,174
So, he said, "It is you." I said, "I?"

42
01:05:10,991 --> 01:05:13,417
He thought I must have forgotten something.

43
01:05:16,394 --> 01:05:21,681
I said, "Not me, I’ve never said like that". Then I thought of the catalogue they had shown me.

44
01:05:25,562 --> 01:05:31,122
I said, "No, no, no, no, no, not me, I’ve not seen any and I think there’s something wrong".

45
01:05:31,122 --> 01:05:35,398
He said, "Gavin show himself the example". I said I was surprised.

46
01:05:35,542 --> 01:05:40,761
And while he told me, he got the example. Well, I was surprised. Have you seen how the myth goes on!

47
01:05:50,350 --> 01:06:02,925
It was critical but I started, you see, thinking that I must have said something, otherwise how can it be, you see? Because if you tell lies all the time,

48
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:10,678
you see, people start believing that the lies are the truth. In the same way, I thought, "How can it be? I must have seen the watch".

49
01:06:17,723 --> 01:06:27,385
Because, you see, everybody was saying that, It’s such an imbroglio such an imbroglio. I said, "How can it be?" But I said, "No, but I never saw still".

50
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:29,678
I said, "Call Gavin".

51
01:06:29,678 --> 01:06:39,610
And Gavin said, "Mother I saw the things [inaudible] but I didn’t know it would be so thick as that!"

52
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:52,936
So, what one has to digest from such a thing?

53
01:06:52,936 --> 01:07:03,209
Is this that, when you are searching anything for your Mother, the best it to see the vibrations.

54
01:07:14,626 --> 01:07:21,434
And you should also for yourself always see to the vibrations.

55
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:32,636
But Gavin is one of the earlier Sahaja Yogis.

56
01:07:35,634 --> 01:07:40,064
And then, if he can forget that, I think anybody can forget it!

57
01:07:49,592 --> 01:07:57,174
So, what you have to remember is this, that God has given you a new personality of vibrations.

58
01:08:02,328 --> 01:08:11,385
Now, as I told you in those pujas slightly, that this watch has got vibrations, tremendous ones, this watch [Shri Mataji’s watch].

59
01:08:15,643 --> 01:08:17,129
And same with the ring.

60
01:08:20,045 --> 01:08:26,766
But we bought it only on vibrations,

61
01:08:30,975 --> 01:08:36,712
not on anything else. And Rustom said, "This is the only watch that has vibrations".

62
01:08:44,044 --> 01:08:49,781
So, what we bought, got us two things together.

63
01:08:49,781 --> 01:08:58,865
And I think one must not give up feeling the vibrations and taking decisions with vibrations.

64
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:06,526
One should take decisions with vibrations and should remember all the time.

65
01:09:06,526 --> 01:09:08,526
For those who can do it, Shri Mataji.

66
01:09:08,957 --> 01:09:14,294
If you try, Gregoire, what I am saying, have confidence in it and you will feel about it.

67
01:09:21,255 --> 01:09:29,353
So that your personality becomes very aware.

68
01:09:29,353 --> 01:09:33,959
Because this watch is not aware that it has got vibrations.

69
01:09:34,883 --> 01:09:39,419
 But you are aware.

70
01:09:46,298 --> 01:09:56,119
So, if you develop your awareness in that way, then you will understand yourself very well.

71
01:10:01,232 --> 01:10:05,336
Otherwise, you can make such big mistakes!

72
01:10:10,387 --> 01:10:30,412
Now what I feel about some of our centres all over, that there’s a kind of a collectivity but not that you have homogeneous, spontaneous collectivity.

73
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:54,582
For example, in a group, when I speak, I find some people have full understanding of what I am talking

74
01:11:02,180 --> 01:11:06,634
and some do not understand me when I go to the subtler side.

75
01:11:13,158 --> 01:11:18,282
When I give lectures, they are very happy because they get vibrations,

76
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:23,732
because the Kundalini goes up.

77
01:11:25,436 --> 01:11:29,688
That’s a very, very good thing because that is how you will develop.

78
01:11:32,871 --> 01:11:37,217
But what about you who have to now become the gurus?

79
01:11:41,878 --> 01:11:44,574
Can you talk to people about Sahaja Yoga?

80
01:11:48,578 --> 01:11:54,726
Do you understand it that you can convince an intelligent man about Sahaja Yoga?

81
01:12:00,824 --> 01:12:04,016
Or you have to use one or two persons all the time?

82
01:12:09,745 --> 01:12:15,098
Because you all must know, intelligently what is Sahaja Yoga.

83
01:12:20,519 --> 01:12:23,677
Otherwise, you cannot spread Sahaja Yoga.
