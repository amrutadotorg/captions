1
00:00:44,408 --> 00:00:51,036
Today we have gathered here to do
the Navaratri Puja.

2
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,493
There were nine times when the major
incarnations

3
00:00:59,694 --> 00:01:04,633
of the Mother of this universe

4
00:01:07,135 --> 00:01:13,266
were manifested. They were manifested
with a purpose.

5
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:23,455
That purpose is to protect Her bhaktas,
Her disciples, Her children.

6
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:26,657
This was

7
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:42,520
a binding love, She could not escape it.

8
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:48,292
Mother's love is binding, She cannot
escape it

9
00:01:48,493 --> 00:01:54,618
and She has to manifest it, work it out

10
00:01:54,826 --> 00:01:59,900
and give that protection to all
Her children.

11
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,259
This protection in the modern times
has taken another form.

12
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:15,666
In those days, the evil was trying

13
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:22,014
to harm, to destroy the people who were
righteous,

14
00:02:22,215 --> 00:02:26,081
who were bhaktas, who were doing
good things,

15
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:31,847
who wanted to lead a very religious life.

16
00:02:32,048 --> 00:02:37,615
So to save them, She incarnated.
To protect them, She incarnated.

17
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:42,367
But they knew what was good, they knew
what was wrong.

18
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:49,026
And they wanted to preserve their good
life, their precious life.

19
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:52,950
They didn't care for money, they didn't
care for power,

20
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:56,892
but just they wanted their life,

21
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:02,148
means they wanted to be alive to worship
the Goddess.

22
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:06,697
And when they were troubled or harmed
or destroyed

23
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:10,398
by these evil forces, She had to manifest.

24
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,618
But in modern times it's become
very complicated

25
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,256
as the modern times are complicated.

26
00:03:18,464 --> 00:03:21,210
First of all,

27
00:03:21,979 --> 00:03:28,027
in the mind, in the lifestyle,
in the society

28
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:34,597
of good human beings, righteous human
beings,

29
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:40,779
fear of the wrong has entered.

30
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,686
Like they are afraid say of their priests,
of their churches,

31
00:03:45,887 --> 00:03:50,340
of their temples, of their mosques,
which are all false.

32
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:54,553
They are not afraid of God, they don't
believe in God.

33
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:59,909
They think they have created God and they
can manage God. So who is God?

34
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:04,048
The way they behave you can see clearly
that they do not recognize

35
00:04:04,249 --> 00:04:09,796
the existence of God, God Almighty who is
a wrathful God.

36
00:04:09,997 --> 00:04:13,757
They are not at all worried as to what
will happen to them.

37
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:18,754
They don't even believe in the second life,
they don't believe in the resurrection.

38
00:04:18,955 --> 00:04:25,473
They are very short-sighted, evil people
doing all kinds of evil things.

39
00:04:25,674 --> 00:04:30,194
So somehow or other, as soon as you
are born,

40
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:33,921
you are born into some sort of a brand,

41
00:04:34,122 --> 00:04:39,614
you are this, you are that, you are that,
you are that, as soon as you are born.

42
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:42,483
So the first brand comes onto this
modern man,

43
00:04:42,684 --> 00:04:47,236
is of what religion to which he belongs.

44
00:04:47,634 --> 00:04:53,494
He can't avoid it, he has to be jolly well
belonging to some religion.

45
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:57,240
You go anywhere, even in the passport -
nowadays they have stopped it -

46
00:04:57,441 --> 00:05:02,101
otherwise they used to ask: "What is
your religion?"

47
00:05:03,231 --> 00:05:08,513
And in India if you said you had no
religion they would not give you a passport

48
00:05:08,714 --> 00:05:12,294
because you are not yet qualified
evil person,

49
00:05:12,495 --> 00:05:16,855
or you are not following qualified
evil people.

50
00:05:17,056 --> 00:05:25,505
So that very simple gullible good people,
very righteous believers of God,

51
00:05:25,706 --> 00:05:32,592
developed this kind of a fear which was put
into their heads by these false people.

52
00:05:32,793 --> 00:05:35,452
That if you don't do like this, if you
don't pay money to us,

53
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:38,091
then God will be wrathful.

54
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:47,100
If you do not come to the confession,
then God will be angry with you,

55
00:05:47,301 --> 00:05:51,432
if you do not tolerate our nonsense,
God will be angry with you.

56
00:05:51,633 --> 00:05:58,218
All these things started going into
the brains of the people very easily.

57
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:03,023
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in drinking.

58
00:06:03,224 --> 00:06:08,236
In some religion they believe there is
no sin in marrying many women.

59
00:06:08,437 --> 00:06:12,685
In some religion they believe that you
can have caste system.

60
00:06:12,886 --> 00:06:21,141
All is anti-God, absolutely anti-God
activity perpetuated into the society

61
00:06:21,342 --> 00:06:27,440
by these priests who are supposed to be
in charge of the religion.

62
00:06:27,641 --> 00:06:34,587
So the first horrible conditioning we have
when we start Sahaja Yoga is this.

63
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:41,488
So to start something afresh they find it
very difficult.

64
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:50,616
So the first protection Mother had
to render is from this conditioning.

65
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:54,765
The second one is that of the country.

66
00:06:54,966 --> 00:06:58,640
Either you belong to this country,
to that country, or to that country.

67
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:09,084
And these days every country is competing
with each other in all kinds of

68
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:17,255
corruption, mafia, all kinds of things,
every country.

69
00:07:17,456 --> 00:07:20,289
Suddenly you discover.

70
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:24,017
You have faith in one country, you find,
oh no, no, they were supporting

71
00:07:24,218 --> 00:07:28,600
certain person secretly.

72
00:07:28,808 --> 00:07:31,469
So whether they are democratic or anything,

73
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:36,561
there is a kind of a mafia working
everywhere under some name.

74
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:43,063
So the so-called laws also are only
for people who are simple, gullible,

75
00:07:43,264 --> 00:07:47,710
pure citizens, and not for the people
who put those laws on them.

76
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:51,310
They take bribes, they take all kinds
of things, but still

77
00:07:51,511 --> 00:07:56,476
they are supposed to be in charge of law,
doing all kinds of illegal things,

78
00:07:56,677 --> 00:08:00,851
because they have made the law, so they
know how to be illegal.

79
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:06,575
So this is the second type of fear that is
in the minds of the modern time.

80
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:12,692
Then the third thing was the war.
Wars after wars came in,

81
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:18,459
so many people developed a kind of a fear
about war,

82
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:23,943
and as a reaction they developed a kind
of a stupid ego,

83
00:08:24,151 --> 00:08:27,850
just they said, to protect themselves.

84
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:34,896
In protection, themselves, they have
built up a big ego

85
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:42,762
and they are now becoming very,
we should say, aggressive people.

86
00:08:44,946 --> 00:08:54,696
So this kind of a wider range,
I should say, of fear,

87
00:08:54,897 --> 00:09:01,075
it can be directed into any direction,
it can be directed towards anyone.

88
00:09:01,276 --> 00:09:09,223
Then comes - is the fear of race -
racialism.

89
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:14,994
Now I'm told that neo-nazism is taking
its own course

90
00:09:15,195 --> 00:09:18,832
and is coming up like a little snake.

91
00:09:21,436 --> 00:09:27,283
So this is another area which is very
dangerous now, working out.

92
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:35,032
Now in the minds of seekers -
in their seeking,

93
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:37,790
they have been to many gurus, they have
read all kinds of books

94
00:09:37,991 --> 00:09:41,783
but they were seeking, you know. !!!!!!AAAAAAAAA
They can, they were seeking, yet...

95
00:09:41,984 --> 00:09:45,333
drink any kind of water, develop all kinds
of diseases, what can you do?

96
00:09:45,534 --> 00:09:50,678
You are seeking after all, you are thirsty.
It has to be excused.

97
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:53,646
And that's how they develop lots
of problems,

98
00:09:53,847 --> 00:09:56,982
not only in their body but also
in their brain.

99
00:09:57,183 --> 00:10:00,900
And now it's a very delicate thing.
If you tell somebody

100
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:04,268
that you have been to such and such guru,
he doesn't want to hear

101
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:07,811
because for him now the guru has become
the last word.

102
00:10:08,012 --> 00:10:11,133
You cannot say anything against his guru.

103
00:10:11,334 --> 00:10:14,882
Now when he starts suffering, then he may
accept,

104
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:18,071
but to take it out that guru is also
very delicate

105
00:10:18,272 --> 00:10:22,468
because if you want to take out that guru,
then he might be hurt.

106
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:26,457
So it's a very delicate operation.

107
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:32,285
Then the modern society, the less said
the better.

108
00:10:32,486 --> 00:10:36,901
The norms of modern society are given
to us by people

109
00:10:37,102 --> 00:10:43,474
who were characterless like Freud, who had
no sense of morality,

110
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:47,977
or by drunkards, though they don't have
any statues of drunkards.

111
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:54,586
But most of them, if you see the abandonment
of our value system comes through drinking.

112
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,940
And the drinking was there but not
to this extent, I mean,

113
00:10:58,141 --> 00:11:01,417
everybody was not a drunkard, these days
everybody can be a drunkard.

114
00:11:01,618 --> 00:11:04,628
And there's no shame about it.
With that drinking

115
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:12,734
our value system started dropping down
and people have accepted now,

116
00:11:12,935 --> 00:11:17,521
the normal thing is abandonment.
This is another way.

117
00:11:20,118 --> 00:11:24,907
Formerly the parents used to support
the person if he would take to God,

118
00:11:25,108 --> 00:11:28,813
if he would take to righteous life
or to something higher.

119
00:11:29,014 --> 00:11:32,796
And if they saw these qualities in their
child they used to be happy,

120
00:11:32,997 --> 00:11:37,673
but these days the other way round,
the parents don't like it.

121
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:42,713
As if the parents have lost everything
in themselves,

122
00:11:42,914 --> 00:11:48,234
so they want to hold on to their children,
grandchildren and possess them.

123
00:11:48,923 --> 00:11:52,466
And brainless creatures, because their
brain has been already washed out,

124
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:58,424
there's nothing in their brains. To fight
the parents also is a big problem.

125
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:02,325
So this kind of a fear is also there, that:
"My mother should not know,

126
00:12:02,526 --> 00:12:06,392
my father should not know," this, that.

127
00:12:07,164 --> 00:12:10,498
You can say from all sides

128
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,936
the fear is burning, like flames.

129
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:25,419
And we are now here, in Kali Yuga, we have
started Sahaja Yoga.

130
00:12:28,357 --> 00:12:37,649
So the way we have to work out
our protection has to be mutual.

131
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:44,551
Mother of course is there to protect you
all the time,

132
00:12:44,752 --> 00:12:47,940
Her powers are there to protect you.

133
00:12:48,141 --> 00:12:52,632
But surprisingly in the modern times,

134
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:57,669
there's one condition which has to be
fulfilled.

135
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:04,804
Because in those days good were good

136
00:13:05,005 --> 00:13:10,025
and evil were evil, there was no mixing up.

137
00:13:10,734 --> 00:13:13,658
So once they asked for Goddess, they
accepted Her,

138
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:17,246
She came in Her real form and She worked
it out.

139
00:13:17,447 --> 00:13:22,367
But in modern times, you must know that
all these evil things

140
00:13:22,568 --> 00:13:26,876
are also lingering in your head, little bit
here and there.

141
00:13:27,077 --> 00:13:29,491
People are extremely superficial,

142
00:13:29,692 --> 00:13:36,889
they are very much prone to the mass
attitude, fashions, things like that.

143
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:42,094
Sort of, their personality is not that
developed as that

144
00:13:42,295 --> 00:13:46,794
of those bhaktas who knew they were right,
who knew they were righteous,

145
00:13:46,995 --> 00:13:49,044
who knew whatever they were doing
was correct

146
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:56,195
and were standing on their legs firm.

147
00:13:56,396 --> 00:14:05,208
So the modern Sahaja Yogi is very different
from the Sahaja Yogi of olden times.

148
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:11,954
Because in the olden times it was not easy
to get Realization.

149
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:17,056
One in a billion, or in a trillion.

150
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:23,150
And they had to work very hard, so as they
worked hard, very hard,

151
00:14:23,351 --> 00:14:28,176
they got cleansed and built up themselves,
you see, and toiled.

152
00:14:28,377 --> 00:14:33,111
Like any art piece which takes time,
is done with care,

153
00:14:33,282 --> 00:14:36,376
is definitely thousand times better than
these modern artists

154
00:14:36,577 --> 00:14:39,333
just putting two, three lines like this.

155
00:14:39,534 --> 00:14:43,829
So the today's human being is like a modern
artist, you see.

156
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:47,586
You put one line and you say: "You must
see this into that person,

157
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,108
you must have an identity." I mean,
what identity people can have?

158
00:14:51,309 --> 00:14:55,794
With one line, you say, find out
the identity.

159
00:14:58,325 --> 00:15:02,917
So the Sahaja Yogis which are today here,
have to realize

160
00:15:03,118 --> 00:15:10,488
that all these things are surrounding us,
and these evil forces are also there.

161
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:14,937
There are some within us, some are without.

162
00:15:15,526 --> 00:15:21,000
So it's a - looks to be very difficult
task, but it's not.

163
00:15:23,574 --> 00:15:28,683
Because one condition if you can
understand,

164
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:33,489
is that you have to recognize Me.

165
00:15:33,698 --> 00:15:38,907
I know I am Mahamaya, I'm really very
clever at it.

166
00:15:44,701 --> 00:15:50,984
But I am truthful, I do not have crocodile
tears, I cannot have.

167
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:56,964
I am truthful, but still I am Mahamaya.

168
00:15:57,165 --> 00:16:02,459
So to recognize Me what should we do?

169
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:07,899
If we recognize then you are protected.

170
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:18,022
And the cleansing is the simplest thing
in Sahaja Yoga is to be collective.

171
00:16:18,223 --> 00:16:24,386
If you are not collective then know that
something wrong with you.

172
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:30,828
If you are collective then as if you are
taking your bath in the river Ganges.

173
00:16:31,029 --> 00:16:34,850
You don't have to go to Himalayas, you
don't have to do individual sadhana much,

174
00:16:35,051 --> 00:16:38,165
you don't have to... just be collective.
If you are collective,

175
00:16:38,366 --> 00:16:44,573
if you are enjoying the collective, then
you should know that you are clean.

176
00:16:44,774 --> 00:16:50,658
No blemishes there, you are absolutely
all right.

177
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:57,697
Now the second part of is - this Mahamaya
business.

178
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:02,393
I had to be very close to you, I had to be
extremely close,

179
00:17:02,594 --> 00:17:06,852
talk to you, to have a rapport, to tell you
everything about Yoga

180
00:17:07,053 --> 00:17:12,872
to make you absolutely aware of yourself.
This had to be done,

181
00:17:13,073 --> 00:17:16,686
and with all these complications within
your mind,

182
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:22,350
within your heart, within your body, I had
to work it out.

183
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:29,922
To come close in the real form would have
been very dangerous,

184
00:17:30,123 --> 00:17:36,095
so One had to be a Mahamaya. But
despite that,

185
00:17:38,819 --> 00:17:45,824
if you could recognize Me,
to understand Me,

186
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:52,293
that I am Divine personality,
it's an Incarnation -

187
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:58,919
that's all the Deities want. Then they'll
look after you in every way.

188
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,204
They'll give you all the powers, they'll
give you all the satisfaction,

189
00:18:04,405 --> 00:18:10,265
all the protection that you want. This is
the condition

190
00:18:11,164 --> 00:18:14,878
which for a rational mind is very difficult
to understand,

191
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:20,931
that how can Adi Shakti be in one body?

192
00:18:21,965 --> 00:18:26,346
How can the Infinite can become finite?

193
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:31,468
But human beings cannot do that.

194
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:38,191
Only human beings. God can do it. He is God
after all.

195
00:18:39,415 --> 00:18:45,617
And if so, you have so many miracles,
you have so many photographs,

196
00:18:45,818 --> 00:18:51,585
so many things to see, but this is what
one has to recognize.

197
00:18:52,198 --> 00:18:56,946
Now I see people, when I talk to them

198
00:18:57,147 --> 00:19:02,142
they start talking to Me a little
frivolously,

199
00:19:02,343 --> 00:19:08,791
not with that depth, not with that feeling
that I am Mahamaya.

200
00:19:08,999 --> 00:19:13,774
Then some of them even answer Me. Some
of them, if I tell them something,

201
00:19:13,975 --> 00:19:20,093
they are ready to give an answer,
explanation.

202
00:19:20,294 --> 00:19:25,051
Of course this freedom I have given you
deliberately,

203
00:19:26,116 --> 00:19:33,806
but must understand that you have
to talk to Me

204
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:40,670
in a way that is, you would talk
to Adi Shakti.

205
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:43,745
Very important.

206
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:56,029
Then how you behave is very important.
You should not be artificial,

207
00:19:56,230 --> 00:20:02,362
you should not be superficial, but best is
to put your hand on your heart,

208
00:20:02,563 --> 00:20:08,132
both the hands, and just try to feel it.

209
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:12,542
Your Mother is Adi Shakti.

210
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:19,501
She has created all this Universe, She
has created all this world,

211
00:20:20,217 --> 00:20:27,965
She is for your protection. Even
Shri Krishna could not protect

212
00:20:28,841 --> 00:20:34,236
Pandavas - they had to go in the forest,
they had to suffer.

213
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:37,977
But not Sahaja Yogis.

214
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:45,367
As soon as I come to know about your
problems, My attention can work out.

215
00:20:45,568 --> 00:20:49,690
Shri Rama Himself had to go to jungles.

216
00:20:49,891 --> 00:20:58,171
All this is given to you, this protection,
because you are seekers of truth,

217
00:20:58,372 --> 00:21:06,636
and the truth is that I am the Adi Shakti
incarnated.

218
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:18,768
Once this truth becomes one with yourself

219
00:21:19,310 --> 00:21:24,800
there is nothing to fear, because
all the Deities know this fact,

220
00:21:25,008 --> 00:21:29,913
they know about this Incarnation very well.
They are all prepared for it,

221
00:21:30,114 --> 00:21:39,035
and they'll do anything to substantiate
your belief.

222
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:45,061
In every way they are trying to give you
My photographs, in the sky, this, that,

223
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,906
I mean all sorts of things. God knows what
they are going to do today.

224
00:21:50,368 --> 00:21:53,319
They are so anxious.

225
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:57,864
They are behind the stage, before
the stage, all sides of the stage,

226
00:21:58,065 --> 00:22:03,694
listening to Me, feeling happy that I am
telling you the truth.

227
00:22:03,895 --> 00:22:11,115
But the way they recognize and the way
they act, they never disobey.

228
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,090
If you behave in the same manner

229
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:23,934
you are completely protected from all these
problems I have told you about.

230
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:31,911
Now I won't say you shouldn't hate anyone,
you shouldn't do.., nothing of the kind.

231
00:22:35,294 --> 00:22:39,340
I wouldn't say you should not steal
something.

232
00:22:39,541 --> 00:22:45,948
I wouldn't say that you make money, don't
make money out of Sahaja Yoga, nothing.

233
00:22:46,149 --> 00:22:50,159
I don't even say don't drink, don't smoke,
I never said so.

234
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:55,229
But automatically once you know whom
you are facing,

235
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:59,630
in whose protection you are, automatically
you will do that.

236
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:02,745
Automatically. You will have no fear.

237
00:23:02,946 --> 00:23:07,686
Once you have recognized you will have
no fear from anyone.

238
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:15,495
And the more you show that recognition,
the more you realize it,

239
00:23:15,696 --> 00:23:21,692
you get higher and higher. Not only
spiritually,

240
00:23:21,893 --> 00:23:28,065
but every way - mentally, socially,
economically, politically.

241
00:23:30,884 --> 00:23:34,262
It's very remarkable

242
00:23:35,795 --> 00:23:42,039
that not only that you recognize Me
as a Mother who loves you very much,

243
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:49,896
but a Mother who is powerful to protect
you, She’s very powerful.

244
00:23:53,191 --> 00:23:57,632
If you realize that, and if you feel that
within your heart,

245
00:23:57,833 --> 00:24:03,002
supposing I correct you sometime, instead
of feeling sad you should see it

246
00:24:03,203 --> 00:24:07,467
that "How fortunate I am that Adi Shakti
Herself is correcting me.

247
00:24:07,668 --> 00:24:10,972
She is taking interest in me.

248
00:24:11,173 --> 00:24:15,777
How fortunate I am to be born at this time,

249
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:22,237
to be with Her in Her great work, what
have I done?"

250
00:24:24,977 --> 00:24:33,165
This recognition itself will fulfil all
the incarnations of Navaratri.

251
00:24:33,366 --> 00:24:39,169
So today we are worshipping the Durga,
Kali,

252
00:24:39,370 --> 00:24:43,893
all these great Goddesses, these Powers,
even Radha.

253
00:24:44,094 --> 00:24:47,266
It was Radha who killed Kamsa not
Shri Krishna.

254
00:24:47,482 --> 00:24:54,129
He had to ask Radha to come and kill him.
It's the Power that kills.

255
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:05,360
So if you realize

256
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:12,574
that your Mother is the Adi Shakti.

257
00:25:12,775 --> 00:25:16,019
I know of so many people.

258
00:25:16,655 --> 00:25:21,365
There's one gentleman who is working
in London airport.

259
00:25:21,732 --> 00:25:24,227
Somebody tried to trouble him. He said:
"You see, be careful of?ah...

260
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:27,786
my Mother is very powerful, you don't
know."

261
00:25:27,955 --> 00:25:33,125
Next day that man lost his job, lost
his business, lost this, lost this,

262
00:25:33,326 --> 00:25:38,495
and he came to him and said: "Now which
is your Mother, let me see Her?"

263
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:50,152
There was a farmer in, near Rahuri,

264
00:25:50,353 --> 00:25:57,245
and in the night three men came to steal
some sugar cane.

265
00:25:58,692 --> 00:26:05,864
And next day they came and they said:
"Which Goddess do you worship?"

266
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:15,134
He said: "Why?". "There were three hefty
people watching your - guarding your field,

267
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:18,600
and we came just to... and we thought,
better take some of this sugar cane,

268
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:26,127
after all, it looks so nice, and they beat
us. Of course we never got hurt."

269
00:26:29,464 --> 00:26:34,527
So just behind this recognition is
all the powers.

270
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:38,842
There's so many, so many stories I can
tell you,

271
00:26:39,043 --> 00:26:43,068
how things have happened, how it has
worked out.

272
00:26:45,935 --> 00:26:53,264
But if you are doubting, still halfway,
this, that, then things won't be all right.

273
00:26:55,123 --> 00:26:58,369
You shouldn't worry about your reputation.

274
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:05,821
Just go with full speed into any direction,
knowing one thing -

275
00:27:06,022 --> 00:27:14,732
that you are My child, and that I am
Adi Shakti.

276
00:27:16,130 --> 00:27:19,082
Everything that looks horrible will become
better.

277
00:27:19,283 --> 00:27:24,626
We have seen it now in this France case,
and all that, what has happened.

278
00:27:24,827 --> 00:27:29,808
Don't worry about anything, just know that

279
00:27:31,777 --> 00:27:34,584
I am the Adi Shakti.

280
00:27:34,785 --> 00:27:41,852
That all the powers of Gods and Goddesses
and all that are within Me,

281
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:46,253
and they are within Me, and they are all
looking after you.

282
00:27:46,454 --> 00:27:52,089
But if that recognition is not there, they
are not going to recognize you either.

283
00:27:58,511 --> 00:28:03,839
So for today's Navaratri I have to tell you
that just try to keep in mind

284
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:09,702
that today you are worshipping
the Adi Shakti and not only Durga.

285
00:28:11,459 --> 00:28:15,858
And you are worshipping Durga and all
these Goddesses to thank them.

286
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:19,905
Because if they had not saved you that time
you would have been so frightened,

287
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:23,882
you would have become bad people and
you would not have been here.

288
00:28:24,083 --> 00:28:28,061
That is why we are thankful to them
for saving us

289
00:28:28,309 --> 00:28:34,827
and giving us this protection at that time
when we were very helpless.

290
00:28:39,996 --> 00:28:42,866
May God bless you all.

291
00:29:01,931 --> 00:29:05,314
Today’s Puja is very simple.

292
00:29:06,759 --> 00:29:10,320
We’ll just have feet to be washed,

293
00:29:10,521 --> 00:29:15,598
just with one Ganesha’s Atharva Sheersha.

294
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:19,984
Anyone can wash it. I think the leaders
need not come -

295
00:29:20,185 --> 00:29:25,740
only from UK.

296
00:29:25,962 --> 00:29:31,622
Because today the Puja is done
by the UK people.

297
00:29:33,366 --> 00:29:41,286
And so I would request two or three people
from UK to come and just wash My feet.
