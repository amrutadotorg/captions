00:07.040 --> 00:11.800
Today is a very great day I must say,

00:12.760 --> 00:19.680
to celebrate Sahasrara, the puja of Sahasrara.

00:21.800 --> 00:28.040
It’s a very unique thing that has happened,

00:28.920 --> 00:33.240
that your Sahasraras were opened out.

00:36.440 --> 00:40.240
There were some very few people in this whole world;

00:40.560 --> 00:45.760
there were some Sufis, there were some saints,

00:45.960 --> 00:49.360
some other people also in China and all.

00:49.680 --> 00:56.680
But very few, very few got their Sahasrara opened out.

00:57.400 --> 01:04.080
So whatever they said or written was never understood

01:04.320 --> 01:06.080
by the people.

01:06.840 --> 01:11.960
They actually tortured them, they crucified them

01:12.160 --> 01:15.040
and did all kinds of horrible things,

01:15.320 --> 01:22.080
because they couldn’t bear somebody getting this realization.

01:23.200 --> 01:24.720
So it’s a very great day

01:24.800 --> 01:31.560
because collectively this Sahasrara has been opened.

01:33.040 --> 01:37.280
Every one of you have got it.

01:37.520 --> 01:41.960
Also all over the world you have many people

01:41.960 --> 01:46.280
who have got their Sahasraras open.

01:47.560 --> 01:52.000
Of course we need many more, for them to understand

01:52.120 --> 01:59.280
what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrara.

01:59.680 --> 02:01.640
Some have grown very much

02:02.240 --> 02:05.200
after getting their realization, very much.

02:06.760 --> 02:10.240
They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well

02:10.440 --> 02:12.760
and they have developed their depth

02:12.960 --> 02:15.640
and their consciousness

02:15.840 --> 02:22.160
is really a great awareness of oneness with the Divine.

02:22.560 --> 02:27.800
To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.

02:28.600 --> 02:34.960
So far they were human beings at a lower level of existence,

02:35.720 --> 02:39.480
and they had all the problems of that level,

02:39.560 --> 02:43.960
is that jealousies, hatred-

02:45.080 --> 02:49.080
all kinds of problems that are today of fighting,

02:49.520 --> 02:51.800
of troubling others,

02:52.000 --> 02:56.480
destroying others and not loving others.

02:57.040 --> 02:59.520
All these problems existed because

02:59.800 --> 03:02.480
their Sahasrara was not opened.

03:04.120 --> 03:09.920
So our main problem is

03:10.120 --> 03:14.880
to open the Sahasrara of the people all over the world-

03:15.360 --> 03:19.920
which is very simple, which you can all do it,

03:20.240 --> 03:23.640
and it will work better if you do it collectively.

03:23.960 --> 03:29.120
If you are collective you can work it out very well.

03:29.800 --> 03:33.200
Like that in Sahaja Yoga so many people have come

03:33.680 --> 03:36.360
whose Sahasrara was completely opened,

03:36.840 --> 03:38.880
and they felt their depth.

03:39.160 --> 03:41.600
Firstly, you must feel your depth.

03:42.160 --> 03:44.600
If you don’t feel your depth

03:44.800 --> 03:48.360
and you are not one with your personality which is so deep,

03:48.560 --> 03:52.520
then you cannot enjoy the Self-Realization.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.960
First of all you should understand yourself.

03:56.200 --> 03:58.240
If you don't understand yourself,

03:58.440 --> 04:01.760
how can you understand other people?

04:02.160 --> 04:03.360
You cannot.

04:03.560 --> 04:08.040
So first this Sahasrara should be opened out fully.

04:08.320 --> 04:13.400
“Fully” means complete oneness with the Divine.

04:13.800 --> 04:17.360
That is not difficult.

04:18.040 --> 04:21.520
Only you have to meditate little bit

04:21.760 --> 04:23.800
and then it will work out.

04:24.080 --> 04:25.440
It has worked out in many people

04:25.640 --> 04:29.680
I am very happy to see, and meet such people in Sahaja Yoga

04:29.960 --> 04:33.880
who have achieved such a lot of collectivity

04:34.080 --> 04:39.160
and also the awareness of a realized soul.

04:39.960 --> 04:43.720
So what is the awareness of a realized soul?

04:44.120 --> 04:46.120
That is what we have to understand today

04:46.320 --> 04:49.560
it’s a very important day, as I said.

04:49.760 --> 04:54.760
The awareness is such that you should now know

04:55.080 --> 05:00.520
what is happening in this world, and how you can help it.

05:00.880 --> 05:05.480
How can you help people to get to this awareness?

05:05.680 --> 05:11.800
Unless you have this full, full knowledge about yourself,

05:12.000 --> 05:14.520
complete strength about yourself

05:14.760 --> 05:18.320
and the confidence, you cannot do it.

05:18.600 --> 05:21.480
Sahasrara Day is to be celebrated

05:21.680 --> 05:27.400
just to strengthen your bond with the Divine,

05:27.600 --> 05:33.680
so that your consciousness becomes absolutely enlightened,

05:33.880 --> 05:38.200
and you see the right point in everything.

05:39.040 --> 05:42.120
It has been in so many countries I have seen,

05:42.320 --> 05:47.360
people have taken to it very, very fast.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.560
Surprising, in Africa which is

05:50.760 --> 05:54.440
not supposed to be very developed country

05:54.640 --> 05:58.560
it's good because thousands have got realization.

05:58.760 --> 05:59.840
Those who are developed

05:59.960 --> 06:02.960
have gone beyond the point of ascent, I think.

06:03.280 --> 06:06.240
That must be the point, they have to come back

06:06.440 --> 06:11.120
from that developed state to this state from where they can rise.

06:11.320 --> 06:15.680
And so the people who have, though got realization

06:15.800 --> 06:18.720
are not ascending so fast as the people

06:18.960 --> 06:24.840
who are not yet so much advanced and modernized.

06:26.920 --> 06:30.640
Still it has worked, it has worked in so many people,

06:30.840 --> 06:34.960
and so many have got this ascent very well.

06:35.200 --> 06:39.760
But I would say that when you are meditating,

06:39.960 --> 06:46.760
also outside you should develop a state of witness.

06:47.800 --> 06:50.880
You should try to find out what is the matter,

06:51.080 --> 06:53.920
what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others,

06:54.120 --> 06:57.040
and how you can help it.

06:57.640 --> 06:58.960
Only with your vibrations

06:59.080 --> 07:02.240
you can correct so many things in your country,

07:02.440 --> 07:04.680
in your family, everywhere.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.640
And as you see now how Sahaja Yoga is growing,

07:07.840 --> 07:09.680
that there’s such a need

07:09.880 --> 07:14.760
and such a desire to get Self-Realization.

07:14.960 --> 07:18.600
But only thing, your approach should be full of love

07:18.800 --> 07:20.520
and full of understanding.

07:20.720 --> 07:23.600
They are coming from the darkness of ignorance

07:23.800 --> 07:30.520
and they have to go into the illumined nature of the Divine

07:30.720 --> 07:33.360
which is, can be very bright for them.

07:33.560 --> 07:40.000
So slowly, slowly if you develop this passionate kindness,

07:40.320 --> 07:41.720
love for them,

07:41.960 --> 07:46.600
I’m sure you can do much more to raise them.

07:46.800 --> 07:50.760
No use getting angry with them, because they are so ignorant,

07:50.960 --> 07:53.560
they don’t know what they are doing, you see.

07:53.760 --> 07:57.800
As Christ has said that “They don’t know what they are doing.”

07:57.960 --> 08:00.920
So what you have to do is to make them understand

08:01.120 --> 08:03.360
whatever they are doing,

08:03.560 --> 08:06.400
whatever they are understanding is still poor,

08:06.640 --> 08:11.040
it’s not so much yet expanded as it could have been

08:11.240 --> 08:13.480
if they were realized souls.

08:13.680 --> 08:18.280
Even after realization I find people have a problem.

08:18.480 --> 08:22.800
They still have the problem of the past life which is finished,

08:22.960 --> 08:26.320
it’s dead, but they still carry on with that

08:26.520 --> 08:30.640
and the consciousness, so much of illumination also

08:30.800 --> 08:32.960
doesn’t show what’s wrong with them.

08:33.200 --> 08:36.760
For example, take the case of ego.

08:37.080 --> 08:39.200
Ego is so developed.

08:39.400 --> 08:42.240
In the Western countries where they are so developed,

08:42.440 --> 08:44.280
ego has also developed,

08:44.480 --> 08:48.280
and they have to find out what’s wrong with them.

08:48.520 --> 08:54.120
This ego comes from certain consciousness

08:54.320 --> 08:56.960
that you have been something great,

08:57.200 --> 08:59.360
you are this, you are that,

08:59.560 --> 09:03.680
your parents have been great maybe, your property is great

09:03.880 --> 09:08.400
or maybe you are occupying very big position, or anything.

09:08.600 --> 09:09.960
It can come from anything,

09:10.200 --> 09:15.280
and this consciousness is against your awareness

09:15.480 --> 09:17.600
because it’s not true.

09:17.800 --> 09:23.000
You are not anything being molded by these outside things,

09:23.200 --> 09:30.880
but you are molded by your own awareness within yourself.

09:31.560 --> 09:33.960
This awareness has to grow.

09:34.200 --> 09:36.920
From where? – is to understand

09:37.080 --> 09:40.600
how do we get this ego, from what point.

09:40.800 --> 09:43.240
Yesterday I felt there were lots of people

09:43.440 --> 09:46.680
who were having a lot of right side on them.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.920
This right side is of no help.

09:49.120 --> 09:52.600
It will create problems for you, sickness for you,

09:52.800 --> 09:56.640
and also no use having right-sided Sahaja yogis.

09:56.840 --> 10:01.840
So the main thing is to understand the power of love.

10:02.240 --> 10:05.480
Power of love is the highest and the greatest,

10:05.680 --> 10:10.840
and if you can manage somehow or other to give up your anger,

10:11.040 --> 10:15.920
give up your greed and also your ego

10:16.120 --> 10:19.920
if you can do that, you can be in Sahasrara.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.960
Now just see the sport of ego.

10:23.200 --> 10:26.360
It stops your ascent further.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.960
At ego only people get lost,

10:29.200 --> 10:33.080
because at ego only they move to the left or to the right

10:33.280 --> 10:37.480
and they can go to the too much of right side,

10:37.880 --> 10:40.400
or can go up to the left side.

10:40.560 --> 10:45.520
They can go to any extreme of these two.

10:45.800 --> 10:49.400
So first of all we have to correct our ego.

10:49.600 --> 10:52.240
For this ego, what should we do?

10:52.440 --> 10:57.280
For this ego we should watch ourselves and laugh at ourselves.

10:57.480 --> 11:00.360
What ego do we have, of what?

11:00.560 --> 11:06.280
We are human beings, now have become divine.

11:06.480 --> 11:12.440
And with divine within us, with this light within us

11:12.640 --> 11:17.160
we have to understand that we are a part and parcel of the Divine,

11:17.360 --> 11:20.880
just a drop in the ocean of love.

11:21.080 --> 11:23.880
If you can reduce your ego,

11:24.080 --> 11:29.960
if you can bring it to the actual sense of your being,

11:30.160 --> 11:32.560
then it will work out better.

11:33.000 --> 11:39.920
I find it in the West, this ego is very strong – very, very strong.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.040
And whatever they do wrong they think is correct,

11:43.240 --> 11:46.200
because ego can support you in every way.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.480
While on the contrary those people who are developing,

11:49.640 --> 11:51.760
the countries who are not yet developed,

11:51.960 --> 11:56.760
there the people, problem is not of ego but of superego.

11:57.000 --> 11:58.680
That can be corrected.

11:58.880 --> 12:02.400
But ego is your own enemy created by you.

12:02.600 --> 12:04.440
So you have to fight it,

12:04.600 --> 12:08.080
and see for yourself from where it is coming.

12:08.320 --> 12:11.800
It might be country-wise, it might be family-wise,

12:12.000 --> 12:13.760
it can be from anywhere.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.080
So first of all we must watch out for the ego,

12:17.280 --> 12:21.880
if it is Sahasrara we have to enter into.

12:22.080 --> 12:25.440
When I was looking out for a collective happening

12:25.600 --> 12:27.040
of Sahasrara opening,

12:27.240 --> 12:32.040
I found it was the ego of people which was keeping Me down.

12:32.240 --> 12:34.640
I had to fight the ego of people.

12:34.880 --> 12:38.920
Because I am a woman of a very simple habits,

12:39.120 --> 12:42.560
no pride, nothing, so people used to suppress Me,

12:42.760 --> 12:45.040
say all kinds of things to Me.

12:45.240 --> 12:49.080
But I understood them because they had ego problem.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.360
And once this ego evolves and tries to dominate,

12:53.560 --> 12:55.880
we can have Hitlers in this country,

12:56.080 --> 13:00.000
we can have all these horrible people all over the world.

13:00.480 --> 13:01.920
So the first thing you should understand:

13:02.120 --> 13:06.840
those who have ego, we should not ever subdue to them.

13:07.040 --> 13:09.560
Of course you shouldn’t start fighting,

13:09.760 --> 13:12.960
but you have faith in yourself that you are people

13:13.160 --> 13:16.200
who have got Self-Realization.

13:16.400 --> 13:19.800
You are much more powerful than they are.

13:19.960 --> 13:24.520
My powers only work out when you are realized souls,

13:24.720 --> 13:27.760
you’ll be surprised. They work out many things

13:27.920 --> 13:30.960
which may not work out with people with ego.

13:31.160 --> 13:33.800
Like the other day I heard from Africa

13:33.960 --> 13:38.160
that people become invisible suddenly.

13:38.400 --> 13:43.160
There was coup d’état and the President is Sahaja yogi,

13:43.360 --> 13:46.200
he became invisible, nobody could find him.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.880
Because they are very much surrendered,

13:51.520 --> 13:58.320
they are so much surrendered that they get advantage of My powers.

13:58.520 --> 14:02.600
You all should use My powers also, of protection.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.800
This protection power is very, very strong,

14:05.960 --> 14:11.920
specially for people who are very much in Sahaja Yoga,

14:12.120 --> 14:13.360
who are very much there.

14:13.560 --> 14:18.480
So you must have first of all complete faith in yourself

14:18.680 --> 14:22.160
that you are Sahaja yogis – but not the ego.

14:22.360 --> 14:25.440
“Sahaja yogis” means you cannot have ego.

14:25.800 --> 14:30.160
This ego business has come from various sources, you know that,

14:30.360 --> 14:32.280
but it has to be cleansed out.

14:32.480 --> 14:36.920
Like when the river flows all kinds of dirt, filth flows into it,

14:37.120 --> 14:41.480
but when it meets the sea it becomes the sea.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.320
In the same way you have to become that.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.400
To become the sea, what you have to do

14:46.600 --> 14:49.080
is to forget all these tributaries

14:49.280 --> 14:50.840
which were coming into you,

14:51.040 --> 14:53.720
and all these wrong ideas which came to you.

14:54.040 --> 14:56.160
It can be from any source.

14:56.360 --> 14:58.600
I do not know how to name them because

14:58.800 --> 15:01.280
there’s a big list of these sources.

15:01.480 --> 15:04.400
People are mad sometimes with this ego.

15:04.600 --> 15:09.880
So main thing is how to watch and witness your ego-

15:10.080 --> 15:13.680
how it works, how it spoils your temperament,

15:13.880 --> 15:15.960
how it spoils your relationships,

15:16.200 --> 15:19.040
how it makes you stupid.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.120
Ego is, first thing it does is to make you very stupid,

15:23.320 --> 15:25.440
and you start behaving in such a manner

15:25.640 --> 15:26.960
that people start thinking that

15:27.200 --> 15:31.520
Oh, you are the great, stupidest person ever living.”

15:31.760 --> 15:33.560
But it is of no help

15:33.800 --> 15:36.920
because if they believe that you are a stupid person,

15:37.120 --> 15:38.400
what will happen?

15:38.560 --> 15:41.120
On the contrary if you have the wisdom,

15:41.320 --> 15:42.480
if you have that peace,

15:42.640 --> 15:45.720
if you have that special temperament

15:45.920 --> 15:49.520
of enjoying everything in life

15:49.720 --> 15:52.680
and also the collective temperament,

15:53.160 --> 15:55.600
it will work out. They will be impressed,

15:55.800 --> 16:01.520
because in that light they can see their own stupidity,

16:01.720 --> 16:04.400
own falsehood, everything,

16:04.600 --> 16:09.080
and they will realize that what they think is not true.

16:09.320 --> 16:12.560
“This gentleman is much deeper than me.

16:12.800 --> 16:15.560
What he has got, I haven’t got it.”

16:15.880 --> 16:18.320
This is the main thing for all of us.

16:18.520 --> 16:22.880
In Sahaja Yoga we have people who are leaders.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.840
That doesn’t mean they become really leaders,

16:26.080 --> 16:29.400
but that means that they have a greater depth.

16:29.600 --> 16:31.560
If they don’t have, they get out.

16:31.760 --> 16:34.720
If they have the depth then they are leaders,

16:34.920 --> 16:36.560
in the sense others see them

16:36.760 --> 16:42.360
and really enjoy, really enjoy their being there.

16:42.600 --> 16:47.040
So, in everything you can see for yourself,

16:47.240 --> 16:49.680
specially, I would say, for the leaders

16:49.920 --> 16:54.600
because people see them and they are the ideals for them.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.680
For Me, they say that “Mother is after all Mother,

16:57.880 --> 17:00.520
what can we achieve from Her?”

17:00.720 --> 17:03.120
But from the leaders they learn a lesson,

17:03.320 --> 17:09.320
and they understand that this is wrong and this is not proper.

17:10.080 --> 17:13.800
First of all you should be model, models of Sahaja Yoga.

17:14.160 --> 17:16.680
And that is what I have been always telling you

17:16.960 --> 17:19.480
that get rid of your ego.

17:19.680 --> 17:23.520
It’s the worst thing, because first of all it brings anger.

17:23.720 --> 17:25.840
You think you are something great

17:26.040 --> 17:27.880
and you can do this, you can do that

17:28.080 --> 17:30.440
because you are a Sahaja yogi- it´s not true.

17:30.720 --> 17:34.680
On the contrary you become extremely humble, extremely humble,

17:34.880 --> 17:36.600
and you do right things.

17:36.800 --> 17:41.600
You do not become any more, any more, arrogant

17:42.280 --> 17:45.520
and also full of anger.

17:45.720 --> 17:49.160
Anger departs from you completely, completely.

17:49.360 --> 17:51.840
It gives you a balance, it gives you wisdom

17:52.040 --> 17:56.920
by which you see what is your job, why are you on this earth,

17:57.080 --> 17:59.400
why this energy has come to you,

17:59.640 --> 18:02.120
why you are a divine personality.

18:02.320 --> 18:05.720
It’s a very, very great responsibility.

18:05.960 --> 18:09.080
You don’t have to look after yourself, no.

18:09.280 --> 18:12.960
The Divine will look after you, absolutely.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.440
It will protect you, it will look after you,

18:16.640 --> 18:19.200
it will do whatever is needed for you.

18:19.400 --> 18:24.160
But in case, in case you have this ego,

18:24.360 --> 18:28.360
you shut out yourself from the reality, from the truth,

18:28.560 --> 18:34.440
and you become very hot-tempered and arrogant personality.

18:34.680 --> 18:36.320
This has to go away.

18:36.520 --> 18:41.520
Sahaja yogis are saints- not saints but they are more than saints

18:41.840 --> 18:44.560
because they can express themselves better.

18:44.760 --> 18:48.240
They have powers in them which they can utilize,

18:48.440 --> 18:53.240
which they can show to other people that you are so powerful,

18:53.440 --> 18:59.640
that you can manage things much better than what you think.

18:59.840 --> 19:02.800
For example, say there’s a problem

19:03.000 --> 19:05.600
and the whole world is upset about it.

19:05.880 --> 19:10.200
Only thing if you know how to witness it, it will disappear,

19:10.480 --> 19:12.680
it will disappear in the whole world.

19:12.880 --> 19:14.520
It cannot remain there.

19:14.720 --> 19:18.880
So nowadays the world is full of turmoil as you see,

19:19.080 --> 19:21.800
full of nonsensical people coming up,

19:22.080 --> 19:28.760
full of quarrelsome people, dominating people are overpowering.

19:28.960 --> 19:33.120
At this time if you just see this in the witness state,

19:33.320 --> 19:34.720
this will disappear.

19:34.920 --> 19:37.400
Because very powerful you are, very powerful,

19:37.600 --> 19:39.360
but you must know first of all

19:39.560 --> 19:43.320
that you must have the equipment to use the power.

19:43.960 --> 19:47.320
If you have that equipment within you, you can do it.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.800
But with your ego you cannot.

19:51.080 --> 19:54.760
Ego is the greatest hurdle for your ascent.

19:54.960 --> 19:57.120
You see that ego is at a place

19:57.320 --> 20:03.000
where you have to just cross to go to Sahasrara.

20:03.200 --> 20:06.360
And to break Sahasrara is very easy otherwise,

20:06.600 --> 20:11.760
but if there is ego you are already lost in that ego.

20:11.960 --> 20:17.880
So against all this one has to understand that, watch yourself.

20:18.080 --> 20:22.680
Is he egoistical? What does it think about itself?

20:22.880 --> 20:26.880
Ego is very limited, it makes you limited,

20:27.080 --> 20:30.160
and you don’t see the purpose of your life.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.680
Why have you become a realized soul? You don’t understand.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.640
You just are involved in your own affairs,

20:37.840 --> 20:40.520
in your family, in your children,

20:40.640 --> 20:43.360
in your something like that, very low.

20:43.560 --> 20:50.320
But if you have - if you have - an egoless temperament

20:50.520 --> 20:54.400
then you are very effective, the whole power works.

20:54.600 --> 20:58.640
What I’ve seen, the power of Sahasrara is so great.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.400
In some people it has worked wonders,

21:01.680 --> 21:04.280
they have worked it well, greatly.

21:04.560 --> 21:09.320
But because of ego, so many people are still not of that level

21:09.520 --> 21:12.880
that we can say they are Sahaja yogis.

21:13.080 --> 21:16.080
Now as it is I am here to tell you about it.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.400
And in those days when these saints came in,

21:19.600 --> 21:22.360
nobody was there to guide them, to tell them anything.

21:22.560 --> 21:27.560
On the contrary they were so much destroyed by the surroundings,

21:27.760 --> 21:31.640
and people never understood why they don’t have any ego,

21:31.840 --> 21:33.680
why they are so humble,

21:33.880 --> 21:36.920
so they misused. But now you have powers.

21:37.120 --> 21:39.280
You must know how to use your powers.

21:39.480 --> 21:41.320
But that should not give you by any chance

21:41.560 --> 21:43.880
any ego that you have powers.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.240
On the contrary, you should be humble.

21:46.440 --> 21:48.280
You have power to be humble,

21:48.480 --> 21:51.160
and if you can be humble and understand

21:51.360 --> 21:54.240
that these people are not yet realized souls,

21:54.440 --> 21:56.000
they’re at a lower level.

21:56.240 --> 21:59.800
Still their ego is catching them and they’re at a lower level,

22:00.000 --> 22:01.360
they have to come up.

22:01.560 --> 22:04.600
When you understand that, then you will have not only pity

22:04.800 --> 22:06.960
but also understanding about them,

22:07.200 --> 22:10.960
and a kind of a help will come to you from the Divine

22:11.160 --> 22:13.160
that will solve your problems.

22:13.360 --> 22:18.040
I find most of you have problems of very low level sometimes.

22:18.240 --> 22:18.840
And then I am surprised,

22:19.000 --> 22:21.960
why are you bothered about these problems?

22:22.160 --> 22:23.680
You see, you are so powerful.

22:23.880 --> 22:27.600
So in Sahasrara you must know what powers are there.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.400
There are one thousand powers,

22:30.840 --> 22:35.440
one thousand powers within you which are being enlightened.

22:35.640 --> 22:37.160
If you can understand that,

22:37.360 --> 22:40.960
then you will understand that what’s the use of having ego,

22:41.160 --> 22:44.440
because you have such a lot of powers within you

22:44.640 --> 22:46.480
which you have not utilized.

22:46.680 --> 22:50.560
We should use, but with the, because of ego you cannot.

22:50.800 --> 22:52.440
With love you can.

22:52.640 --> 22:55.360
With love you can manage, and you can do a lot.

22:55.560 --> 23:00.040
So I would request all of you today to take a vow

23:00.240 --> 23:04.680
that “We’ll have no more chances for our egos.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.080
We’ll give it up.

23:06.280 --> 23:09.080
We’ll give up our ego.” Because there’s no sense

23:09.280 --> 23:11.400
that’s an obstruction between us.

23:11.600 --> 23:13.560
When the Sahasrara wants to work

23:13.680 --> 23:16.600
it cannot because of ego obstruction,

23:16.800 --> 23:19.560
so better not have ego of anything.

23:19.760 --> 23:21.240
You may be a good singer,

23:21.440 --> 23:24.360
you may be anything in life, may be some big man

23:24.560 --> 23:27.640
or anything what is so-called, has no meaning.

23:27.840 --> 23:31.040
What we need today are people who are egoless

23:31.240 --> 23:35.960
and who have powers completely flowing in them.

23:36.160 --> 23:40.040
With the opening of Sahasrara all these powers should flow.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.200
If the Sahasrara is fully opened,

23:42.440 --> 23:45.400
all these powers of love should flow.

23:45.600 --> 23:46.320
You’ll be amazed,

23:46.480 --> 23:49.160
I mean, wherever I go people just fall in love with Me.

23:49.360 --> 23:51.320
I don’t know why, I don’t do anything to them,

23:51.520 --> 23:54.040
but just they feel My love.

23:54.240 --> 23:57.800
That’s what it should be, that people should feel your love

23:57.960 --> 24:02.760
and they should know that you are a lovable person.

24:02.960 --> 24:05.920
This is the thing you are made as special people,

24:06.120 --> 24:09.960
very special for this whole world’s emancipation.

24:10.160 --> 24:13.920
That’s your job, and not otherwise just collecting money

24:14.120 --> 24:16.720
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

24:16.960 --> 24:20.040
You are for here very, very sensible job

24:20.240 --> 24:24.160
which is to raise the kundalini of people

24:24.360 --> 24:27.960
and make them aware of their greatness.

24:28.200 --> 24:31.320
Human beings are not created only to war and fight,

24:31.520 --> 24:35.240
not created here to play politics and do all dirty tricks.

24:35.440 --> 24:38.520
Here, they are not made here

24:38.720 --> 24:43.800
to lead a life which is very, I would say, filthy and dirty,

24:43.960 --> 24:46.480
but in this world we are here

24:46.680 --> 24:50.080
to do such a great job of God who has created us.

24:50.280 --> 24:53.240
So this is possible if you are aware

24:53.440 --> 24:57.040
that your Sahasraras are being opened out,

24:57.240 --> 25:02.200
and that in this Sahasrara resides the purity,

25:02.440 --> 25:06.400
not all these small little things about which you are worried.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.760
Some people try to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

25:09.960 --> 25:11.720
thinking that – oh, they can do better,

25:11.920 --> 25:15.440
they can have help of others - nothing of the kind.

25:15.640 --> 25:18.960
You can be helped by yourself, you don’t need any help.

25:19.160 --> 25:21.840
On the contrary you have to help others.

25:22.040 --> 25:26.880
There is no need to expect any help from anyone. .

25:27.080 --> 25:30.200
Look at Me, I am an ordinary housewife otherwise,

25:30.400 --> 25:33.160
but how it has worked all over the world.

25:33.360 --> 25:36.640
By what? By just the power of love.

25:36.840 --> 25:39.960
Only trouble is that I can use My power of love,

25:40.200 --> 25:43.200
but you don’t know how to use. That's the only problem.

25:43.400 --> 25:45.440
If you want to use your power of love,

25:45.640 --> 25:49.240
in meditation you can develop that power of love.

25:49.440 --> 25:54.840
With that you can capture people, with that you can understand.

25:55.040 --> 25:58.400
Their problems are that they are not Sahaja yogis,

25:58.600 --> 26:04.240
they are not the people who are having all the blessings

26:04.440 --> 26:06.240
or the connection with the Divine.

26:06.440 --> 26:08.880
Imagine, you are connected with Divine.

26:09.080 --> 26:11.520
And Divine is such a great thing

26:11.720 --> 26:13.800
which has created this whole universe,

26:13.960 --> 26:17.480
created you, and have done all the great jobs.

26:17.680 --> 26:18.560
So what are you?

26:18.760 --> 26:21.480
You are a part and parcel of that divine Power,

26:21.680 --> 26:26.240
so why not we use our divine Power fully within us

26:26.440 --> 26:29.600
with love and with understanding

26:29.800 --> 26:32.600
so that you develop this wisdom within you.

26:32.800 --> 26:35.160
This is what is to be told to yourself,

26:35.320 --> 26:37.240
that “We are realized souls.”

26:37.440 --> 26:42.800
This one is something, a personality special, very much special.

26:43.000 --> 26:46.360
In this world there were very few people who are realized souls,

26:46.560 --> 26:48.960
but now we have so many, I can see them.

26:49.200 --> 26:53.720
But still if it’s lacking in … some problems are there

26:53.920 --> 26:56.160
because of our ego.

26:56.360 --> 26:59.960
One should not have ego of anything. Everything is perishable,

27:00.160 --> 27:02.920
what is not perishable is divine love,

27:03.160 --> 27:06.640
what is not perishable is divine personality.

27:06.840 --> 27:09.280
All the time you see the saints and all that,

27:09.480 --> 27:12.480
though they are dead, people remember them.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.160
All their poetry is remembered.

27:14.360 --> 27:17.800
Though they could not do much of Sahasrara work,

27:17.960 --> 27:20.240
they couldn’t give realization to people,

27:20.440 --> 27:24.680
still because of their personality they are still respected.

27:24.920 --> 27:26.400
And people know that

27:26.560 --> 27:29.720
these people have been doing marvelous things,

27:29.920 --> 27:31.240
miraculous things.

27:31.440 --> 27:34.480
In the same way you can see your own miracles,

27:34.680 --> 27:38.120
and you can see for yourself what you are capable of,

27:38.320 --> 27:41.240
because now you are connected with the Divine.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.920
This is one fact you should know.

27:44.120 --> 27:46.760
Whenever there is danger, whenever there is problem

27:46.960 --> 27:49.320
you will say you’ll be saved.

27:49.520 --> 27:52.160
Many have been saved out of you, no doubt,

27:52.360 --> 27:56.880
but that is not sufficient. You are saved for what?

27:57.080 --> 28:00.320
What is the value of your life, why are you living?

28:00.520 --> 28:04.160
What is the matter, why God has saved you, given you all this?

28:04.360 --> 28:08.760
Because there’s so much to be done for this world.

28:08.960 --> 28:14.360
You are the, I should say soldiers of truth, soldier of goodness,

28:14.560 --> 28:19.480
and all that is to be done with great courage and understanding

28:19.680 --> 28:20.840
about yourself.

28:21.040 --> 28:23.840
So what you have to do is to have self-knowledge.

28:24.040 --> 28:25.800
You have to know about yourself.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.720
You must have self-knowledge, what you are.

28:28.920 --> 28:30.160
If that you don’t have,

28:30.320 --> 28:32.120
what’s the use of opening the Sahasrara?

28:32.320 --> 28:35.280
Self-knowledge is, doesn’t give you any pride, nothing,

28:35.480 --> 28:38.640
but gives you the duty what you have to do,

28:38.840 --> 28:40.800
what you have to work out.

28:40.960 --> 28:44.080
It’s not only just for you, that Sahaja Yoga,

28:44.280 --> 28:47.520
but you are for the whole world – please try to understand.

28:47.720 --> 28:51.360
Sometimes we think Sahaja Yoga is there for our betterment,

28:51.560 --> 28:54.320
for our good health, this, that. It’s not so.

28:54.520 --> 28:59.840
It is for the betterment of others.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.560
Your powers are there which you are not utilizing.

29:03.760 --> 29:05.920
You are still busy- I get letters saying that

29:06.120 --> 29:08.560
“this is wrong with us, this is wrong with that..”

29:08.760 --> 29:10.840
I mean, why can’t you correct yourself?

29:11.040 --> 29:13.960
If you can’t correct yourself, how can you correct others?

29:14.200 --> 29:15.440
That’s what it is.

29:15.640 --> 29:19.880
I would say, I can see

29:20.080 --> 29:24.680
that there’s an understanding going into your understanding

29:24.880 --> 29:29.480
that you are great and you’re not ordinary people.

29:29.880 --> 29:34.480
And this has to be practiced and to be used in a manner

29:34.680 --> 29:38.240
that will show that you are Sahaja yogis.

29:38.480 --> 29:41.000
You are no less than any, any Sufi or

29:41.240 --> 29:44.880
any realized soul or any saint, no less.

29:45.080 --> 29:48.600
But you have powers which they didn’t have,

29:48.800 --> 29:52.560
of which they were not conscious, while you have these powers.

29:52.760 --> 29:55.040
Try to understand what powers you have.

29:55.240 --> 29:56.760
But by understanding that,

29:56.960 --> 29:59.280
you should not have pride about it or in a way,

29:59.480 --> 30:02.840
but that’s your job, you have to do it. You are there,

30:03.040 --> 30:09.040
and you’ll enjoy it because it is not with ego, but egoless work.

30:09.240 --> 30:12.240
If you can manage that much, it will be very good.

30:12.440 --> 30:15.480
Now ego has come down very much, I must say, very much.

30:15.680 --> 30:19.960
I hear from people that ego has come down.

30:20.480 --> 30:23.360
But sometimes they are still quite funny

30:23.560 --> 30:25.480
and fighting, and this and that.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.920
But despite all that, I must say in this,

30:28.120 --> 30:32.040
whatever work has been done on these years,

30:32.240 --> 30:34.160
people have worked it out among themselves.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.320
So you have to watch yourself

30:37.520 --> 30:41.560
and see for yourself what ego you have,

30:41.800 --> 30:44.120
what, why should you be egoistical?

30:44.320 --> 30:47.200
Some of the people have ego of their country,

30:47.400 --> 30:50.000
some of the people – I mean it’s all mythical.

30:50.240 --> 30:53.960
It’s all mythical. What is there, you could have been born anywhere.

30:54.160 --> 30:57.600
So you are born in a particular country, you have that ego.

30:57.800 --> 31:01.160
And it is something, I must say, one has to be ashamed of;

31:01.360 --> 31:06.120
because your country whatever it is, is not doing very well,

31:06.320 --> 31:08.120
it’s not spiritually equipped,

31:08.320 --> 31:11.040
so why should you be so proud of your country?

31:11.240 --> 31:12.600
When you will work it out

31:12.840 --> 31:14.800
and they will become spiritually equipped,

31:14.960 --> 31:18.040
then of course you can have pride in your country,

31:18.240 --> 31:22.440
but I see not that happening. And so you have to work it out.

31:22.640 --> 31:24.560
And I am also happy to see

31:24.760 --> 31:27.960
that so much of Sahaja Yoga is now spread out everywhere.

31:28.160 --> 31:29.800
It’s spreading very fast.

31:29.960 --> 31:33.360
In countries where I never expected, it’s spreading out.

31:33.600 --> 31:37.320
So there are people everywhere in the world who want to have it.

31:37.520 --> 31:39.480
They want to have their realization,

31:39.640 --> 31:44.960
and they want to know what is beyond this human life.

31:45.160 --> 31:48.400
They don’t want to waste their life anymore as human beings;

31:48.600 --> 31:52.840
but as super-human beings I should call them, as Sahaja yogis.

31:53.040 --> 31:58.960
So our ego has to be seen, is to be watched in witness state,

31:59.160 --> 32:00.200
how it works

32:00.400 --> 32:05.600
and how it tries to dissuade us

32:05.760 --> 32:09.040
from the right path of movement.

32:10.040 --> 32:11.960
One has to be only careful on that point,

32:12.200 --> 32:16.880
because that’s the last center which has to be opened out.

32:17.160 --> 32:21.800
Once it is completely open, you are one with the Divine

32:22.240 --> 32:24.600
and your all problems will be solved,

32:24.800 --> 32:29.320
because these problems are so frivolous and has no meaning.

32:29.520 --> 32:32.200
They’ll go away in no time, as long

32:32.360 --> 32:35.800
as you work it out, your Sahasrara.

32:36.080 --> 32:39.760
It’s very nice that today is a very special day

32:39.960 --> 32:44.000
with all these three stars are coming together,

32:44.200 --> 32:47.080
and it’s special blessing.

32:49.360 --> 32:55.080
If your powers increase, all these people who are very bad,

32:55.280 --> 32:57.920
who are trying to capture the society

32:58.160 --> 33:00.640
with their political nonsense and all that,

33:00.840 --> 33:02.080
they all will disappear.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.040
They have no powers, they’ll all disappear.

33:05.240 --> 33:09.720
So, first of all your egoless nature will help,

33:09.920 --> 33:11.440
will help everyone.

33:11.600 --> 33:13.720
May God bless you all.
