00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.800
Today is a very great day I must say,

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.680
to celebrate Sahasrara, the puja of Sahasrara.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.040
It’s a very unique thing that has happened,

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.240
that your Sahasraras were opened out.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.240
There were some very few people in this whole world;

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.760
there were some Sufis, there were some saints,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.360
some other people also in China and all.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:56.680
But very few, very few got their Sahasrara opened out.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.080
So whatever they said or written was never understood

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.080
by the people.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.960
They actually tortured them, they crucified them

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:15.040
and did all kinds of horrible things,

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.080
because they couldn’t bear somebody getting this realization.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.720
So it’s a very great day

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.560
because collectively this Sahasrara has been opened.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.280
Every one of you have got it.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.960
Also all over the world you have many people

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.280
who have got their Sahasraras open.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.000
Of course we need many more, for them to understand

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:59.280
what is this great event of such a collective opening of Sahasrara.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.640
Some have grown very much

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.200
after getting their realization, very much.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.240
They have understood Sahaja Yoga very well

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.760
and they have developed their depth

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.640
and their consciousness

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:22.160
is really a great awareness of oneness with the Divine.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.800
To be one with the Divine is the greatest blessing for human beings.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:34.960
So far they were human beings at a lower level of existence,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.480
and they had all the problems of that level,

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.960
is that jealousies, hatred-

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.080
all kinds of problems that are today of fighting,

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.800
of troubling others,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.480
destroying others and not loving others.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.520
All these problems existed because

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.480
their Sahasrara was not opened.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:09.920
So our main problem is

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:14.880
to open the Sahasrara of the people all over the world-

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.920
which is very simple, which you can all do it,

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.640
and it will work better if you do it collectively.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.120
If you are collective you can work it out very well.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.200
Like that in Sahaja Yoga so many people have come

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.360
whose Sahasrara was completely opened,

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.880
and they felt their depth.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.600
Firstly, you must feel your depth.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.600
If you don’t feel your depth

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.360
and you are not one with your personality which is so deep,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.520
then you cannot enjoy the Self-Realization.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.960
First of all you should understand yourself.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:58.240
If you don't understand yourself,

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.760
how can you understand other people?

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.360
You cannot.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.040
So first this Sahasrara should be opened out fully.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:13.400
“Fully” means complete oneness with the Divine.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.360
That is not difficult.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:21.520
Only you have to meditate little bit

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:23.800
and then it will work out.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.440
It has worked out in many people

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.680
I am very happy to see, and meet such people in Sahaja Yoga

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.880
who have achieved such a lot of collectivity

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.160
and also the awareness of a realized soul.

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:43.720
So what is the awareness of a realized soul?

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120
That is what we have to understand today

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.560
it’s a very important day, as I said.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:54.760
The awareness is such that you should now know

00:04:55.080 --> 00:05:00.520
what is happening in this world, and how you can help it.

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.480
How can you help people to get to this awareness?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:11.800
Unless you have this full, full knowledge about yourself,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.520
complete strength about yourself

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.320
and the confidence, you cannot do it.

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.480
Sahasrara Day is to be celebrated

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.400
just to strengthen your bond with the Divine,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.680
so that your consciousness becomes absolutely enlightened,

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.200
and you see the right point in everything.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.120
It has been in so many countries I have seen,

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.360
people have taken to it very, very fast.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.560
Surprising, in Africa which is

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.440
not supposed to be very developed country

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:58.560
it's good because thousands have got realization.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:59.840
Those who are developed

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.960
have gone beyond the point of ascent, I think.

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.240
That must be the point, they have to come back

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.120
from that developed state to this state from where they can rise.

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.680
And so the people who have, though got realization

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.720
are not ascending so fast as the people

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:24.840
who are not yet so much advanced and modernized.

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:30.640
Still it has worked, it has worked in so many people,

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.960
and so many have got this ascent very well.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:39.760
But I would say that when you are meditating,

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.760
also outside you should develop a state of witness.

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.880
You should try to find out what is the matter,

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.920
what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others,

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.040
and how you can help it.

00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:58.960
Only with your vibrations

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:02.240
you can correct so many things in your country,

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:04.680
in your family, everywhere.

00:07:04.880 --> 00:07:07.640
And as you see now how Sahaja Yoga is growing,

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.680
that there’s such a need

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:14.760
and such a desire to get Self-Realization.

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:18.600
But only thing, your approach should be full of love

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.520
and full of understanding.

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.600
They are coming from the darkness of ignorance

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:30.520
and they have to go into the illumined nature of the Divine

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:33.360
which is, can be very bright for them.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.000
So slowly, slowly if you develop this passionate kindness,

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.720
love for them,

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:46.600
I’m sure you can do much more to raise them.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:50.760
No use getting angry with them, because they are so ignorant,

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.560
they don’t know what they are doing, you see.

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.800
As Christ has said that “They don’t know what they are doing.”

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:00.920
So what you have to do is to make them understand

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.360
whatever they are doing,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.400
whatever they are understanding is still poor,

00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:11.040
it’s not so much yet expanded as it could have been

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.480
if they were realized souls.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:18.280
Even after realization I find people have a problem.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:22.800
They still have the problem of the past life which is finished,

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:26.320
it’s dead, but they still carry on with that

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.640
and the consciousness, so much of illumination also

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.960
doesn’t show what’s wrong with them.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.760
For example, take the case of ego.

00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.200
Ego is so developed.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.240
In the Western countries where they are so developed,

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.280
ego has also developed,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:48.280
and they have to find out what’s wrong with them.

00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:54.120
This ego comes from certain consciousness

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.960
that you have been something great,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:08:59.360
you are this, you are that,

00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:03.680
your parents have been great maybe, your property is great

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:08.400
or maybe you are occupying very big position, or anything.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.960
It can come from anything,

00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:15.280
and this consciousness is against your awareness

00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.600
because it’s not true.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:23.000
You are not anything being molded by these outside things,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:30.880
but you are molded by your own awareness within yourself.

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:33.960
This awareness has to grow.

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.920
From where? – is to understand

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:40.600
how do we get this ego, from what point.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:43.240
Yesterday I felt there were lots of people

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.680
who were having a lot of right side on them.

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.920
This right side is of no help.

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:52.600
It will create problems for you, sickness for you,

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.640
and also no use having right-sided Sahaja yogis.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:10:01.840
So the main thing is to understand the power of love.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.480
Power of love is the highest and the greatest,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:10.840
and if you can manage somehow or other to give up your anger,

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:15.920
give up your greed and also your ego

00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:19.920
if you can do that, you can be in Sahasrara.

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.960
Now just see the sport of ego.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:26.360
It stops your ascent further.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:28.960
At ego only people get lost,

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.080
because at ego only they move to the left or to the right

00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:37.480
and they can go to the too much of right side,

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.400
or can go up to the left side.

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:45.520
They can go to any extreme of these two.

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:49.400
So first of all we have to correct our ego.

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.240
For this ego, what should we do?

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:57.280
For this ego we should watch ourselves and laugh at ourselves.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:00.360
What ego do we have, of what?

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:06.280
We are human beings, now have become divine.

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:12.440
And with divine within us, with this light within us

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.160
we have to understand that we are a part and parcel of the Divine,

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.880
just a drop in the ocean of love.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.880
If you can reduce your ego,

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:29.960
if you can bring it to the actual sense of your being,

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.560
then it will work out better.

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:39.920
I find it in the West, this ego is very strong – very, very strong.

00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:43.040
And whatever they do wrong they think is correct,

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.200
because ego can support you in every way.

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:49.480
While on the contrary those people who are developing,

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.760
the countries who are not yet developed,

00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:56.760
there the people, problem is not of ego but of superego.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.680
That can be corrected.

00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.400
But ego is your own enemy created by you.

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:04.440
So you have to fight it,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.080
and see for yourself from where it is coming.

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.800
It might be country-wise, it might be family-wise,

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.760
it can be from anywhere.

00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:17.080
So first of all we must watch out for the ego,

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:21.880
if it is Sahasrara we have to enter into.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:25.440
When I was looking out for a collective happening

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.040
of Sahasrara opening,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:32.040
I found it was the ego of people which was keeping Me down.

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.640
I had to fight the ego of people.

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.920
Because I am a woman of a very simple habits,

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.560
no pride, nothing, so people used to suppress Me,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:45.040
say all kinds of things to Me.

00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.080
But I understood them because they had ego problem.

00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.360
And once this ego evolves and tries to dominate,

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:55.880
we can have Hitlers in this country,

00:12:56.080 --> 00:13:00.000
we can have all these horrible people all over the world.

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:01.920
So the first thing you should understand:

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.840
those who have ego, we should not ever subdue to them.

00:13:07.040 --> 00:13:09.560
Of course you shouldn’t start fighting,

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:12.960
but you have faith in yourself that you are people

00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:16.200
who have got Self-Realization.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.800
You are much more powerful than they are.

00:13:19.960 --> 00:13:24.520
My powers only work out when you are realized souls,

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:27.760
you’ll be surprised. They work out many things

00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:30.960
which may not work out with people with ego.

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:33.800
Like the other day I heard from Africa

00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:38.160
that people become invisible suddenly.

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:43.160
There was coup d’état and the President is Sahaja yogi,

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:46.200
he became invisible, nobody could find him.

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:50.880
Because they are very much surrendered,

00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:58.320
they are so much surrendered that they get advantage of My powers.

00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:02.600
You all should use My powers also, of protection.

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.800
This protection power is very, very strong,

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:11.920
specially for people who are very much in Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.360
who are very much there.

00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:18.480
So you must have first of all complete faith in yourself

00:14:18.680 --> 00:14:22.160
that you are Sahaja yogis – but not the ego.

00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.440
“Sahaja yogis” means you cannot have ego.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.160
This ego business has come from various sources, you know that,

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.280
but it has to be cleansed out.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.920
Like when the river flows all kinds of dirt, filth flows into it,

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:41.480
but when it meets the sea it becomes the sea.

00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:44.320
In the same way you have to become that.

00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.400
To become the sea, what you have to do

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:49.080
is to forget all these tributaries

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:50.840
which were coming into you,

00:14:51.040 --> 00:14:53.720
and all these wrong ideas which came to you.

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.160
It can be from any source.

00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:58.600
I do not know how to name them because

00:14:58.800 --> 00:15:01.280
there’s a big list of these sources.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:04.400
People are mad sometimes with this ego.

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:09.880
So main thing is how to watch and witness your ego-

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.680
how it works, how it spoils your temperament,

00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:15.960
how it spoils your relationships,

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:19.040
how it makes you stupid.

00:15:19.360 --> 00:15:23.120
Ego is, first thing it does is to make you very stupid,

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.440
and you start behaving in such a manner

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:26.960
that people start thinking that

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.520
Oh, you are the great, stupidest person ever living.”

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.560
But it is of no help

00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.920
because if they believe that you are a stupid person,

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.400
what will happen?

00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:41.120
On the contrary if you have the wisdom,

00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.480
if you have that peace,

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.720
if you have that special temperament

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.520
of enjoying everything in life

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:52.680
and also the collective temperament,

00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:55.600
it will work out. They will be impressed,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:16:01.520
because in that light they can see their own stupidity,

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:04.400
own falsehood, everything,

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.080
and they will realize that what they think is not true.

00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:12.560
“This gentleman is much deeper than me.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:15.560
What he has got, I haven’t got it.”

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:18.320
This is the main thing for all of us.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.880
In Sahaja Yoga we have people who are leaders.

00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:25.840
That doesn’t mean they become really leaders,

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.400
but that means that they have a greater depth.

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.560
If they don’t have, they get out.

00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.720
If they have the depth then they are leaders,

00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:36.560
in the sense others see them

00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:42.360
and really enjoy, really enjoy their being there.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:47.040
So, in everything you can see for yourself,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.680
specially, I would say, for the leaders

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.600
because people see them and they are the ideals for them.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.680
For Me, they say that “Mother is after all Mother,

00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.520
what can we achieve from Her?”

00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:03.120
But from the leaders they learn a lesson,

00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:09.320
and they understand that this is wrong and this is not proper.

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:13.800
First of all you should be model, models of Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.680
And that is what I have been always telling you

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:19.480
that get rid of your ego.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:23.520
It’s the worst thing, because first of all it brings anger.

00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.840
You think you are something great

00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.880
and you can do this, you can do that

00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:30.440
because you are a Sahaja yogi- it´s not true.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:34.680
On the contrary you become extremely humble, extremely humble,

00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.600
and you do right things.

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.600
You do not become any more, any more, arrogant

00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:45.520
and also full of anger.

00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:49.160
Anger departs from you completely, completely.

00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:51.840
It gives you a balance, it gives you wisdom

00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:56.920
by which you see what is your job, why are you on this earth,

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.400
why this energy has come to you,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.120
why you are a divine personality.

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.720
It’s a very, very great responsibility.

00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:09.080
You don’t have to look after yourself, no.

00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:12.960
The Divine will look after you, absolutely.

00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:16.440
It will protect you, it will look after you,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:19.200
it will do whatever is needed for you.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.160
But in case, in case you have this ego,

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:28.360
you shut out yourself from the reality, from the truth,

00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:34.440
and you become very hot-tempered and arrogant personality.

00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.320
This has to go away.

00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:41.520
Sahaja yogis are saints- not saints but they are more than saints

00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.560
because they can express themselves better.

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:48.240
They have powers in them which they can utilize,

00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.240
which they can show to other people that you are so powerful,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:59.640
that you can manage things much better than what you think.

00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.800
For example, say there’s a problem

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:05.600
and the whole world is upset about it.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:10.200
Only thing if you know how to witness it, it will disappear,

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:12.680
it will disappear in the whole world.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.520
It cannot remain there.

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.880
So nowadays the world is full of turmoil as you see,

00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:21.800
full of nonsensical people coming up,

00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:28.760
full of quarrelsome people, dominating people are overpowering.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.120
At this time if you just see this in the witness state,

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.720
this will disappear.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:37.400
Because very powerful you are, very powerful,

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.360
but you must know first of all

00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:43.320
that you must have the equipment to use the power.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:47.320
If you have that equipment within you, you can do it.

00:19:47.560 --> 00:19:50.800
But with your ego you cannot.

00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:54.760
Ego is the greatest hurdle for your ascent.

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:57.120
You see that ego is at a place

00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:03.000
where you have to just cross to go to Sahasrara.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.360
And to break Sahasrara is very easy otherwise,

00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:11.760
but if there is ego you are already lost in that ego.

00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:17.880
So against all this one has to understand that, watch yourself.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:22.680
Is he egoistical? What does it think about itself?

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:26.880
Ego is very limited, it makes you limited,

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:30.160
and you don’t see the purpose of your life.

00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:33.680
Why have you become a realized soul? You don’t understand.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:37.640
You just are involved in your own affairs,

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:40.520
in your family, in your children,

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.360
in your something like that, very low.

00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:50.320
But if you have - if you have - an egoless temperament

00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.400
then you are very effective, the whole power works.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.640
What I’ve seen, the power of Sahasrara is so great.

00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:01.400
In some people it has worked wonders,

00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:04.280
they have worked it well, greatly.

00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:09.320
But because of ego, so many people are still not of that level

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.880
that we can say they are Sahaja yogis.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.080
Now as it is I am here to tell you about it.

00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:19.400
And in those days when these saints came in,

00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:22.360
nobody was there to guide them, to tell them anything.

00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:27.560
On the contrary they were so much destroyed by the surroundings,

00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:31.640
and people never understood why they don’t have any ego,

00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.680
why they are so humble,

00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.920
so they misused. But now you have powers.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:39.280
You must know how to use your powers.

00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.320
But that should not give you by any chance

00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:43.880
any ego that you have powers.

00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:46.240
On the contrary, you should be humble.

00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:48.280
You have power to be humble,

00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:51.160
and if you can be humble and understand

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:54.240
that these people are not yet realized souls,

00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.000
they’re at a lower level.

00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:59.800
Still their ego is catching them and they’re at a lower level,

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.360
they have to come up.

00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.600
When you understand that, then you will have not only pity

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:06.960
but also understanding about them,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.960
and a kind of a help will come to you from the Divine

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:13.160
that will solve your problems.

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:18.040
I find most of you have problems of very low level sometimes.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:18.840
And then I am surprised,

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.960
why are you bothered about these problems?

00:22:22.160 --> 00:22:23.680
You see, you are so powerful.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.600
So in Sahasrara you must know what powers are there.

00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:30.400
There are one thousand powers,

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.440
one thousand powers within you which are being enlightened.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:37.160
If you can understand that,

00:22:37.360 --> 00:22:40.960
then you will understand that what’s the use of having ego,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:44.440
because you have such a lot of powers within you

00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:46.480
which you have not utilized.

00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.560
We should use, but with the, because of ego you cannot.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.440
With love you can.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:55.360
With love you can manage, and you can do a lot.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:23:00.040
So I would request all of you today to take a vow

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:04.680
that “We’ll have no more chances for our egos.

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.080
We’ll give it up.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.080
We’ll give up our ego.” Because there’s no sense

00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:11.400
that’s an obstruction between us.

00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.560
When the Sahasrara wants to work

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:16.600
it cannot because of ego obstruction,

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.560
so better not have ego of anything.

00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.240
You may be a good singer,

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:24.360
you may be anything in life, may be some big man

00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.640
or anything what is so-called, has no meaning.

00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:31.040
What we need today are people who are egoless

00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:35.960
and who have powers completely flowing in them.

00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.040
With the opening of Sahasrara all these powers should flow.

00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:42.200
If the Sahasrara is fully opened,

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:45.400
all these powers of love should flow.

00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:46.320
You’ll be amazed,

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:49.160
I mean, wherever I go people just fall in love with Me.

00:23:49.360 --> 00:23:51.320
I don’t know why, I don’t do anything to them,

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.040
but just they feel My love.

00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:57.800
That’s what it should be, that people should feel your love

00:23:57.960 --> 00:24:02.760
and they should know that you are a lovable person.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.920
This is the thing you are made as special people,

00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:09.960
very special for this whole world’s emancipation.

00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.920
That’s your job, and not otherwise just collecting money

00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:16.720
and doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.040
You are for here very, very sensible job

00:24:20.240 --> 00:24:24.160
which is to raise the kundalini of people

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:27.960
and make them aware of their greatness.

00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.320
Human beings are not created only to war and fight,

00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:35.240
not created here to play politics and do all dirty tricks.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:38.520
Here, they are not made here

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:43.800
to lead a life which is very, I would say, filthy and dirty,

00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:46.480
but in this world we are here

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:50.080
to do such a great job of God who has created us.

00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.240
So this is possible if you are aware

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:57.040
that your Sahasraras are being opened out,

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.200
and that in this Sahasrara resides the purity,

00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.400
not all these small little things about which you are worried.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:09.760
Some people try to take advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.720
thinking that – oh, they can do better,

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.440
they can have help of others - nothing of the kind.

00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:18.960
You can be helped by yourself, you don’t need any help.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:21.840
On the contrary you have to help others.

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:26.880
There is no need to expect any help from anyone. .

00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:30.200
Look at Me, I am an ordinary housewife otherwise,

00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:33.160
but how it has worked all over the world.

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:36.640
By what? By just the power of love.

00:25:36.840 --> 00:25:39.960
Only trouble is that I can use My power of love,

00:25:40.200 --> 00:25:43.200
but you don’t know how to use. That's the only problem.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.440
If you want to use your power of love,

00:25:45.640 --> 00:25:49.240
in meditation you can develop that power of love.

00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:54.840
With that you can capture people, with that you can understand.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:58.400
Their problems are that they are not Sahaja yogis,

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:04.240
they are not the people who are having all the blessings

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:06.240
or the connection with the Divine.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.880
Imagine, you are connected with Divine.

00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:11.520
And Divine is such a great thing

00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.800
which has created this whole universe,

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:17.480
created you, and have done all the great jobs.

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.560
So what are you?

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.480
You are a part and parcel of that divine Power,

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:26.240
so why not we use our divine Power fully within us

00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.600
with love and with understanding

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.600
so that you develop this wisdom within you.

00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:35.160
This is what is to be told to yourself,

00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:37.240
that “We are realized souls.”

00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:42.800
This one is something, a personality special, very much special.

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:46.360
In this world there were very few people who are realized souls,

00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.960
but now we have so many, I can see them.

00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:53.720
But still if it’s lacking in … some problems are there

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.160
because of our ego.

00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:59.960
One should not have ego of anything. Everything is perishable,

00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.920
what is not perishable is divine love,

00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.640
what is not perishable is divine personality.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.280
All the time you see the saints and all that,

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:12.480
though they are dead, people remember them.

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.160
All their poetry is remembered.

00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.800
Though they could not do much of Sahasrara work,

00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:20.240
they couldn’t give realization to people,

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.680
still because of their personality they are still respected.

00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:26.400
And people know that

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:29.720
these people have been doing marvelous things,

00:27:29.920 --> 00:27:31.240
miraculous things.

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:34.480
In the same way you can see your own miracles,

00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:38.120
and you can see for yourself what you are capable of,

00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:41.240
because now you are connected with the Divine.

00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.920
This is one fact you should know.

00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:46.760
Whenever there is danger, whenever there is problem

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.320
you will say you’ll be saved.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:52.160
Many have been saved out of you, no doubt,

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:56.880
but that is not sufficient. You are saved for what?

00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.320
What is the value of your life, why are you living?

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.160
What is the matter, why God has saved you, given you all this?

00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:08.760
Because there’s so much to be done for this world.

00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.360
You are the, I should say soldiers of truth, soldier of goodness,

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:19.480
and all that is to be done with great courage and understanding

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.840
about yourself.

00:28:21.040 --> 00:28:23.840
So what you have to do is to have self-knowledge.

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.800
You have to know about yourself.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.720
You must have self-knowledge, what you are.

00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:30.160
If that you don’t have,

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:32.120
what’s the use of opening the Sahasrara?

00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:35.280
Self-knowledge is, doesn’t give you any pride, nothing,

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:38.640
but gives you the duty what you have to do,

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.800
what you have to work out.

00:28:40.960 --> 00:28:44.080
It’s not only just for you, that Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:44.280 --> 00:28:47.520
but you are for the whole world – please try to understand.

00:28:47.720 --> 00:28:51.360
Sometimes we think Sahaja Yoga is there for our betterment,

00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:54.320
for our good health, this, that. It’s not so.

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:59.840
It is for the betterment of others.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.560
Your powers are there which you are not utilizing.

00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:05.920
You are still busy- I get letters saying that

00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:08.560
“this is wrong with us, this is wrong with that..”

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.840
I mean, why can’t you correct yourself?

00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:13.960
If you can’t correct yourself, how can you correct others?

00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:15.440
That’s what it is.

00:29:15.640 --> 00:29:19.880
I would say, I can see

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.680
that there’s an understanding going into your understanding

00:29:24.880 --> 00:29:29.480
that you are great and you’re not ordinary people.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.480
And this has to be practiced and to be used in a manner

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:38.240
that will show that you are Sahaja yogis.

00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.000
You are no less than any, any Sufi or

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:44.880
any realized soul or any saint, no less.

00:29:45.080 --> 00:29:48.600
But you have powers which they didn’t have,

00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.560
of which they were not conscious, while you have these powers.

00:29:52.760 --> 00:29:55.040
Try to understand what powers you have.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.760
But by understanding that,

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.280
you should not have pride about it or in a way,

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.840
but that’s your job, you have to do it. You are there,

00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.040
and you’ll enjoy it because it is not with ego, but egoless work.

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.240
If you can manage that much, it will be very good.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.480
Now ego has come down very much, I must say, very much.

00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:19.960
I hear from people that ego has come down.

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.360
But sometimes they are still quite funny

00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:25.480
and fighting, and this and that.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.920
But despite all that, I must say in this,

00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:32.040
whatever work has been done on these years,

00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.160
people have worked it out among themselves.

00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.320
So you have to watch yourself

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.560
and see for yourself what ego you have,

00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.120
what, why should you be egoistical?

00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.200
Some of the people have ego of their country,

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:50.000
some of the people – I mean it’s all mythical.

00:30:50.240 --> 00:30:53.960
It’s all mythical. What is there, you could have been born anywhere.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.600
So you are born in a particular country, you have that ego.

00:30:57.800 --> 00:31:01.160
And it is something, I must say, one has to be ashamed of;

00:31:01.360 --> 00:31:06.120
because your country whatever it is, is not doing very well,

00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:08.120
it’s not spiritually equipped,

00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.040
so why should you be so proud of your country?

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:12.600
When you will work it out

00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:14.800
and they will become spiritually equipped,

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:18.040
then of course you can have pride in your country,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.440
but I see not that happening. And so you have to work it out.

00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.560
And I am also happy to see

00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.960
that so much of Sahaja Yoga is now spread out everywhere.

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.800
It’s spreading very fast.

00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:33.360
In countries where I never expected, it’s spreading out.

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.320
So there are people everywhere in the world who want to have it.

00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.480
They want to have their realization,

00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:44.960
and they want to know what is beyond this human life.

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:48.400
They don’t want to waste their life anymore as human beings;

00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:52.840
but as super-human beings I should call them, as Sahaja yogis.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:58.960
So our ego has to be seen, is to be watched in witness state,

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.200
how it works

00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:05.600
and how it tries to dissuade us

00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:09.040
from the right path of movement.

00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:11.960
One has to be only careful on that point,

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.880
because that’s the last center which has to be opened out.

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:21.800
Once it is completely open, you are one with the Divine

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.600
and your all problems will be solved,

00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.320
because these problems are so frivolous and has no meaning.

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:32.200
They’ll go away in no time, as long

00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:35.800
as you work it out, your Sahasrara.

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:39.760
It’s very nice that today is a very special day

00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.000
with all these three stars are coming together,

00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:47.080
and it’s special blessing.

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:55.080
If your powers increase, all these people who are very bad,

00:32:55.280 --> 00:32:57.920
who are trying to capture the society

00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.640
with their political nonsense and all that,

00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:02.080
they all will disappear.

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:05.040
They have no powers, they’ll all disappear.

00:33:05.240 --> 00:33:09.720
So, first of all your egoless nature will help,

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:11.440
will help everyone.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.720
May God bless you all.
