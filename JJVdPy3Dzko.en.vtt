WEBVTT

19:19.967 --> 19:24.550
Today in the land of Shri Krishna

19:25.758 --> 19:30.633
we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

19:33.259 --> 19:40.550
Is something very unprecedented

19:41.675 --> 19:51.967
and of a very significant value

19:55.134 --> 19:59.259
that you should be celebrating

20:02.508 --> 20:10.259
the birthday of Shri Krishna’s Son in His own land.

20:11.883 --> 20:14.466
You know that Shri Ganesha incarnated

20:14.800 --> 20:18.175
on this Earth as Mahavishnu

20:20.008 --> 20:25.591
and He was the Son of Radha,

20:28.134 --> 20:36.842
who incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

20:38.217 --> 20:41.758
So by celebrating this birthday

20:42.466 --> 20:46.425
today you are recognizing the greatest truth

20:46.842 --> 20:55.675
that Lord Jesus Christ was the son of Shri Krishna.

20:59.134 --> 21:04.758
There’s a story about it if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam,

21:06.300 --> 21:14.384
how this Primordial Child took a form of an egg

21:14.842 --> 21:18.758
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesha

21:19.134 --> 21:26.425
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

21:29.550 --> 21:39.591
In the evolutionary process all these happenings

21:41.424 --> 21:45.092
of the antiquities

21:48.259 --> 21:50.758
have been recorded

21:50.842 --> 21:52.716
but today

21:55.008 --> 21:57.425
I feel so gratified that

21:57.758 --> 22:02.050
on the human level people have understood,

22:06.134 --> 22:14.758
Christ is the incarnation of Lord Ganesha.

22:15.633 --> 22:21.050
He is the Eternal Child

22:21.508 --> 22:25.842
but in the form when He came as Christ,

22:26.259 --> 22:33.259
He came as the son of Shri Krishna.

22:34.175 --> 22:40.342
But when Parvati made Shri Ganesha,

22:40.800 --> 22:46.424
He was the son of Parvati alone.

22:47.425 --> 22:50.342
There was no Father.

22:50.800 --> 22:57.550
Parvati Herself wanted to have a child of Her own.

22:58.008 --> 23:03.425
There were angels who were dedicated

23:04.217 --> 23:07.633
either to Vishnu or to Shiva,

23:10.217 --> 23:16.342
like ganas were dedicated

23:20.342 --> 23:22.591
to Shiva alone.

23:23.384 --> 23:29.134
So, She wanted to have Her own Son

23:30.300 --> 23:32.384
who can

23:37.716 --> 23:40.300
permeate

23:43.008 --> 23:47.758
Her powers on this Earth.

23:56.800 --> 24:03.508
So to begin with when the Shakti created this Universe

24:04.008 --> 24:08.092
and Sadashiva was watching Her creation,

24:08.424 --> 24:14.758
the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence

24:15.384 --> 24:21.424
and the embodiment of that innocence was Shri Ganesha.

24:23.883 --> 24:29.175
The whole Universe was covered with innocence,

24:29.591 --> 24:35.384
which we call as Omkara.

24:40.342 --> 24:49.424
This innocence protected all the creation of the world

24:49.883 --> 24:53.716
and penetrated into all that is matter.

24:54.050 --> 24:57.883
Matter is innocent.

25:01.217 --> 25:04.050
If you hit the matter, it will hit you back

25:04.466 --> 25:06.425
because it is built like that.

25:06.842 --> 25:10.758
It doesn’t want to harm you by any method

25:11.134 --> 25:13.342
except that if you try to hit it,

25:13.675 --> 25:20.092
it hits you back, in its own nature.

25:22.008 --> 25:24.675
So it was called as Jada,

25:25.008 --> 25:32.883
the one that acts according to the built-in nature.

25:36.217 --> 25:41.842
Innocence in the animals is of another kind,

25:42.425 --> 25:44.342
where the animals do not know

25:44.633 --> 25:47.675
that they are committing crimes.

25:48.092 --> 25:50.008
Animals

25:52.134 --> 25:56.425
when they say, kill an animal, another animal,

26:00.259 --> 26:02.883
or trespass your properties,

26:05.425 --> 26:07.466
create nuisance all over,

26:07.800 --> 26:10.134
they don’t know they are committing a sin

26:10.425 --> 26:14.259
or they are disobeying some laws.

26:16.175 --> 26:21.758
They live with the laws that are built within them,

26:22.217 --> 26:26.716
that’s why they are called as pashus means bondage

26:27.050 --> 26:29.675
– the pasha. Pasha means the bondage.

26:30.092 --> 26:37.384
They are under the bondage of the laws of God.

26:42.175 --> 26:48.050
Shri Shiva is called as Pashupati.

26:48.424 --> 26:55.925
Up to that stage the innocence remains intact

26:58.633 --> 27:05.550
because there is no development of ego in them.

27:08.466 --> 27:10.883
So they are innocent.

27:11.259 --> 27:16.342
A tiger may eat a cow, still he is innocent

27:16.758 --> 27:19.175
or an elephant may trample

27:19.550 --> 27:25.842
over a human body, still he is innocent.

27:29.967 --> 27:36.508
But when going to a higher state,

27:39.259 --> 27:42.424
the Mother Shakti, the Primordial Mother thought

27:42.800 --> 27:46.384
of creating a personality

27:47.550 --> 27:53.883
who will protect the innocence of human beings.

27:54.384 --> 27:57.675
Above the matter, above the animals,

27:58.050 --> 28:02.466
She created Shri Ganesha.

28:03.050 --> 28:05.259
And you know the story of Shri Ganesha

28:05.633 --> 28:08.800
how He got the head of an elephant

28:09.300 --> 28:12.175
– symbolizing that Shri Ganesha,

28:12.550 --> 28:14.425
though He is a human being,

28:14.842 --> 28:18.716
He is like an animal as far as His head is concerned,

28:19.092 --> 28:24.633
that too of Shri Gajanana, in the sense that

28:25.050 --> 28:30.217
He has got the head of an elephant

28:30.591 --> 28:37.800
which is the wisest animal in the animal kingdom.

28:38.716 --> 28:44.134
So in such a head, which is innocent,

28:44.466 --> 28:46.300
ego cannot develop.

28:46.716 --> 28:51.591
There is no ego. It’s an ego-less state.

28:53.092 --> 29:01.883
But human beings were created in a different manner

29:04.050 --> 29:11.008
and when carbon was placed to create aminoacids,

29:13.008 --> 29:18.050
it also settled them in motion,

29:18.591 --> 29:23.508
a new type of evolution in human beings

29:24.092 --> 29:28.300
that at the Vishuddhi level human beings raised

29:28.591 --> 29:31.466
[his head] their heads like this.

29:31.967 --> 29:34.716
Animals’ heads are on the ground

29:35.384 --> 29:43.758
so the energy flows downward into Mother Earth

29:44.259 --> 29:47.466
but when man raised his head above,

29:47.925 --> 29:52.466
against the energy of gravity,

29:53.466 --> 30:00.342
then a new complication started in the energy flow

30:02.425 --> 30:05.425
and that is how at the Vishuddhi,

30:05.842 --> 30:11.384
a problem started where Kundalini

30:12.925 --> 30:15.384
could not

30:19.175 --> 30:21.050
nourish

30:21.424 --> 30:27.424
or look after that problematic Vishuddhi.

30:29.716 --> 30:33.550
The reason is when you raise your head

30:34.175 --> 30:36.342
from the Mother Earth,

30:36.758 --> 30:39.384
you remove yourself away

30:39.800 --> 30:43.967
from the natural power of Mother Earth.

30:45.466 --> 30:50.716
When you take your Vishuddhi upward like that,

30:52.842 --> 30:55.300
you see the result of that in this country

30:55.716 --> 31:00.675
which is the country of Vishuddhi Chakra,

31:01.800 --> 31:07.300
that you started going to machines which are against nature,

31:08.092 --> 31:10.466
extracting the nature,

31:11.175 --> 31:16.134
disturbing the nature by creating atomic bombs,

31:18.925 --> 31:23.466
by changing the atom, breaking it.

31:25.008 --> 31:28.134
That means you went against the nature itself

31:28.425 --> 31:31.925
by raising your head.

31:32.925 --> 31:36.217
But if it was done

31:39.425 --> 31:42.008
in complete surrender to God,

31:43.883 --> 31:48.342
with your bent head towards the Mother Earth,

31:48.758 --> 31:52.633
it would not have harmed you.

31:53.092 --> 32:01.300
But when you completely cut off yourself from that nature,

32:01.675 --> 32:06.425
which is so bountiful, which is so gracious.

32:06.925 --> 32:09.466
Yesterday you saw the beautiful pictures

32:09.842 --> 32:14.591
of the nature that surrounds you in this country.

32:15.466 --> 32:21.508
Such a rich country like America,

32:22.883 --> 32:27.716
without any gratitude towards its Creator

32:28.217 --> 32:30.883
raised its head upward

32:31.342 --> 32:36.591
– that’s how the Vishuddhi problem started coming up.

32:38.883 --> 32:45.050
In every walk of life, the whole social structure

32:45.508 --> 32:48.675
was built up to fight the nature,

32:49.092 --> 32:52.842
not to go along with the nature.

32:54.050 --> 32:59.675
So the first attack came on the innocence itself

33:01.008 --> 33:04.633
– on the Mooladhara itself.

33:05.175 --> 33:10.842
So the natural ways of Mooladhara were given up.

33:12.259 --> 33:20.466
Marriage system has been here much before Christ,

33:21.758 --> 33:29.300
much before Abraham, much before Moses

33:31.508 --> 33:41.758
and a sanctified marriage, which was blessed by the society,

33:44.425 --> 33:49.217
was acceptable since long.

33:50.175 --> 33:53.800
But man in his arrogance

33:54.217 --> 33:58.384
raised his voice against the marriage,

33:58.842 --> 34:06.425
against the natural way of leading a life of sanity.

34:08.008 --> 34:18.384
If it was natural to be the way people lead their private life,

34:19.425 --> 34:26.259
why do they get all kinds of diseases?

34:27.758 --> 34:31.425
If you are a natural person, you don’t get any diseases.

34:34.633 --> 34:37.134
Because you are anti-nature,

34:40.800 --> 34:42.925
that’s why

34:46.508 --> 34:50.175
in this country now many man and women were murdered

34:50.967 --> 34:53.050
for jealousy?

34:54.342 --> 34:57.050
If it was natural

34:58.008 --> 35:00.300
to be in love with ten men and ten women

35:02.092 --> 35:04.092
then why jealousy?

35:06.175 --> 35:11.384
You should be happy, it’s very natural.

35:14.384 --> 35:17.633
Because the head was raised at Vishuddhi Chakra

35:18.008 --> 35:23.591
without surrendering to Shri Krishna,

35:26.591 --> 35:38.175
anti-life, anti-biotic atmosphere started growing.

35:41.466 --> 35:47.466
And this kind of life has taken this great country,

35:47.967 --> 35:54.050
now to the brink of complete destruction.

35:55.800 --> 36:00.134
The attack of innocence

36:00.550 --> 36:06.134
is the greatest weakness of this country.

36:07.342 --> 36:16.384
Not to value the power of chastity and a chaste life

36:18.675 --> 36:26.050
is the biggest mistake that was created by the people

36:26.466 --> 36:31.508
who started all kinds of trends and fads.

36:32.050 --> 36:38.842
Ganesha is the root of Creation.

36:39.466 --> 36:43.259
When you go against Shri Ganesh

36:43.675 --> 36:48.508
you start losing your roots, you have no roots at all.

36:49.134 --> 36:53.550
Then you get drifted into anything stupid,

36:53.967 --> 36:58.842
anything new that comes up.

36:59.633 --> 37:07.134
So much so that a person like Freud was worshipped

37:08.008 --> 37:11.300
and they forgot Christ,

37:11.675 --> 37:15.466
who said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

37:15.967 --> 37:20.842
Ganesha to that level, that even the eyes have to be innocent.

37:21.300 --> 37:26.342
There should be no lust in your eyes.

37:29.175 --> 37:33.092
But arrogance

37:34.883 --> 37:36.842
made them feel, “What’s wrong?

37:37.758 --> 37:40.967
What’s wrong in this? What’s wrong in this?”

37:41.384 --> 37:49.050
Now the whole country is facing a great crisis

37:50.800 --> 37:57.883
because of arrogant enterprises.

38:00.591 --> 38:11.092
Still they make a martyrdom out of all that is destructive.

38:15.550 --> 38:20.591
It’s a very great responsibility on the Sahaja yogis

38:20.925 --> 38:26.175
who live on the land of Shri Ganesha.

38:26.591 --> 38:36.925
But for the people who live in the land of Shri Krishna,

38:37.342 --> 38:45.384
the responsibility is absolutely on your neck

38:47.134 --> 38:52.425
and you can’t get out of it.

38:54.424 --> 38:57.633
Unless and until you understand the importance

38:58.008 --> 39:01.217
of innocence in your life

39:01.591 --> 39:07.175
you cannot save this country whatever I may try to do for it.

39:07.591 --> 39:11.925
It’s only you who are going to save it.

39:12.425 --> 39:19.883
It’s only you who are going to make it.

39:22.758 --> 39:24.758
When the Kundalini rises

39:25.424 --> 39:28.425
Shri Ganesha is awakened in you,

39:29.384 --> 39:34.424
the Ganesha whom you never respected,

39:35.259 --> 39:43.466
slowly comes up from His slumber,

39:44.134 --> 39:48.800
out of the hurt and the injuries inflicted on Him,

39:49.134 --> 39:52.800
still He stands up.

39:53.466 --> 39:54.300
But still weak,

39:58.508 --> 40:01.425
How are we going to nourish it?

40:01.883 --> 40:09.384
How are we going to look after its growth?

40:12.675 --> 40:20.175
The responsibility of Sahaja yogis of America is very great.

40:20.842 --> 40:25.925
They cannot cheat any more themselves.

40:26.384 --> 40:31.800
They cannot be satisfied with their arrogance.

40:32.259 --> 40:37.424
The mistakes have been grievous.

40:38.384 --> 40:43.092
So you have to take it up as a crusade

40:43.758 --> 40:45.925
against those mistakes

40:46.800 --> 40:51.550
and to establish your Shri Ganesha in a full form

40:52.175 --> 40:55.716
so that He gives you the necessary balance

40:55.716 --> 41:00.466
and the roots to nourish yourself.

41:01.300 --> 41:02.883
It is shocking first.

41:03.217 --> 41:06.425
I mean you just can’t understand;

41:07.300 --> 41:08.842
it is impossible

41:10.967 --> 41:16.342
to see how you could accept such absurd ideas;

41:19.675 --> 41:25.883
how you could take to such funny things,

41:29.466 --> 41:35.175
which are obviously horrid.

41:41.675 --> 41:46.217
Are we not aware of certain words like prostitution?

41:46.633 --> 41:48.591
And all other dirty words that they use,

41:48.967 --> 41:51.716
which I don’t want to say just now,

41:52.050 --> 41:56.883
or they have lost their meanings?

41:58.591 --> 42:04.550
We were all aware of it, we all knew about it.

42:05.259 --> 42:09.591
[Don’t do that … You should not.

42:10.050 --> 42:15.425
When I’m speaking must be quiet, all right?]

42:16.800 --> 42:22.384
Have we lost all wisdom from our minds

42:23.175 --> 42:26.384
that we cannot see

42:29.092 --> 42:31.842
what we have done to ourselves?

42:32.842 --> 42:37.466
We have no self-respect.

42:39.800 --> 42:46.008
Arrogance to that limit is very dangerous,

42:47.424 --> 42:53.050
extremely unpredictable.

42:53.550 --> 42:57.175
And God knows what can come through

42:57.508 --> 43:04.466
with all these ventures we have gone into.

43:07.842 --> 43:10.259
I would say for Sahaja yogis,

43:10.591 --> 43:16.134
I have given some instructions with people

43:16.508 --> 43:23.217
– how they should respect their privacy of life,

43:27.466 --> 43:31.425
specially the women of America.

43:32.134 --> 43:35.217
If they have to be the shaktis,

43:35.716 --> 43:42.300
they have to respect their chastity.

43:43.967 --> 43:53.050
But so surprising that when we see outside

43:53.550 --> 43:59.092
all these things happening, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

43:59.716 --> 44:06.967
some of us try to be one of them who are going to hell.

44:07.883 --> 44:10.342
If you have to save them,

44:10.800 --> 44:19.466
then try to fix your positions, properly.

44:21.050 --> 44:26.550
Shri Ganesha has four hands

44:27.967 --> 44:35.466
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

44:36.800 --> 44:42.217
is the one you have to be careful about.

44:47.259 --> 44:49.800
That is His job

44:52.591 --> 44:54.967
and if you neglect Him,

44:57.384 --> 44:59.800
that force will act

45:01.466 --> 45:04.300
and act so vehemently

45:04.925 --> 45:07.424
that despite your realization

45:07.800 --> 45:12.633
you may not be able to save yourself.

45:13.259 --> 45:16.300
Do not take your realization for granted.

45:16.716 --> 45:19.300
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

45:19.633 --> 45:22.967
your realization has no meaning at all.

45:23.550 --> 45:25.591
Watch yourself,

45:27.008 --> 45:30.134
have you got adulterous eyes?

45:34.217 --> 45:39.466
Have you got an adulterous mind?

45:43.092 --> 45:49.967
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

45:51.217 --> 45:54.716
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

45:55.134 --> 46:01.134
then you must get a good amount of health,

46:01.633 --> 46:03.424
money

46:06.883 --> 46:08.758
and position,

46:09.008 --> 46:10.842
power.

46:14.633 --> 46:21.967
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha,

46:22.342 --> 46:26.925
Nirmal Ganesha.

46:30.591 --> 46:35.925
“Oh, Mother, please give us

46:36.842 --> 46:42.425
the blessings of establishment of purity

46:43.384 --> 46:48.758
in our Ganesha principle.”

46:50.175 --> 46:51.675
In relationships,

46:56.716 --> 46:58.967
in attitudes,

47:02.675 --> 47:04.425
in behavior,

47:08.633 --> 47:13.217
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

47:17.342 --> 47:25.050
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

47:25.508 --> 47:30.842
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

47:31.758 --> 47:37.466
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

47:38.050 --> 47:42.259
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

47:42.716 --> 47:49.217
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

47:49.716 --> 47:54.842
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

47:55.300 --> 48:00.758
Everything that is done against Him after realization

48:01.758 --> 48:05.675
will tell upon you

48:08.675 --> 48:13.800
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

48:14.925 --> 48:19.008
as absolutely degraded people.

48:19.425 --> 48:23.424
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

48:23.842 --> 48:30.466
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

48:32.342 --> 48:34.758
Whatever you have done in the past is finished now

48:35.175 --> 48:37.842
because you are a new bird.

48:38.259 --> 48:41.300
But after becoming this,

48:41.800 --> 48:48.175
if you try to take to these wrong ideas

48:49.134 --> 48:57.633
or to indulge into them, I cannot help you at all.

49:01.217 --> 49:06.550
After all Shri Ganesha is My Son

49:08.134 --> 49:12.259
because He is pure.

49:14.633 --> 49:18.134
Now He is not the only son I have.

49:18.508 --> 49:21.633
I have so many sons and daughters

49:22.008 --> 49:24.466
and I have made you in the same way

49:24.466 --> 49:28.758
as I created Shri Ganesha, without the Father,

49:29.342 --> 49:32.425
on My own.

49:35.758 --> 49:40.092
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

49:40.425 --> 49:49.259
and purity of your body is going to please.

49:51.259 --> 49:55.008
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

49:55.384 --> 50:00.217
My name itself means purity.

50:01.550 --> 50:03.508
You can do it.

50:03.800 --> 50:05.425
You are empowered to do it.

50:05.758 --> 50:07.300
You have a Kundalini to do it.

50:07.633 --> 50:13.508
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

50:15.675 --> 50:18.300
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

50:18.633 --> 50:22.633
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

50:23.175 --> 50:28.425
One chakra you keep clean, the rest is looked after.

50:30.800 --> 50:36.800
All your incurable diseases right from

50:39.716 --> 50:43.758
all muscular troubles like mellitus and all that,

50:44.092 --> 50:49.092
all your incurable diseases right from cancer onwards,

50:51.424 --> 50:54.134
all your psychosomatic problems

50:56.008 --> 50:59.008
right from schizophrenia, everything

50:59.758 --> 51:03.925
come because of the disturbance in Mooladhara.

51:07.384 --> 51:10.300
When the roots are not all right,

51:11.716 --> 51:14.591
how can you cure the tree?

51:15.175 --> 51:16.967
If the roots are all right

51:17.424 --> 51:21.342
then any medicine can reach any center,

51:22.008 --> 51:26.217
any area, any place, any fruit.

51:28.008 --> 51:30.633
But if the roots are not all right,

51:31.925 --> 51:34.134
how can you work it out?

51:36.591 --> 51:39.259
Today you have called Me here,

51:39.591 --> 51:44.466
to worship Shri Ganesha, within Me.

51:47.300 --> 51:53.425
Shri Ganesha within Me is a powerful identity.

51:55.217 --> 52:00.800
While worshipping Him you have to know

52:02.092 --> 52:07.675
that such a powerful thing

52:08.217 --> 52:12.175
you have to establish within yourself

52:13.758 --> 52:16.550
and by that establishment

52:19.092 --> 52:27.883
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

52:32.259 --> 52:35.300
and the power of Shri Ganesha’s

52:37.466 --> 52:41.716
greatness is auspiciousness.

52:46.633 --> 52:51.342
It’s a coefficience;

52:52.424 --> 52:57.508
it’s a formula, we can say in scientific language,

52:58.217 --> 53:04.175
that emits auspiciousness.

53:09.508 --> 53:16.050
It’s a magnet in the Mother Earth.

53:17.217 --> 53:21.134
The same magnet is within you,

53:21.466 --> 53:23.425
which is Shri Ganesha.

53:23.716 --> 53:26.175
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

53:26.466 --> 53:33.800
which is the north, south, east, west.

53:34.466 --> 53:37.425
Close My eyes, still I’ll tell you.

53:37.842 --> 53:40.800
You know there are so many birds who fly out

53:41.175 --> 53:44.092
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

53:44.425 --> 53:46.550
because they have that magnet with them,

53:46.883 --> 53:48.883
they have that innocence with them.

53:49.300 --> 53:50.758
There are so many fishes,

53:51.134 --> 53:56.050
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

53:56.967 --> 53:59.259
Scientists should find out.

53:59.675 --> 54:07.550
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

54:08.300 --> 54:17.092
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

54:18.300 --> 54:19.092
becomes magnetic

54:28.550 --> 54:34.716
and magnet attracts the steel

54:35.967 --> 54:41.300
– not dried leaves, does not – steel.

54:41.758 --> 54:45.217
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

54:45.633 --> 54:49.259
Is a man with the steel, say.

54:49.716 --> 54:55.925
“Man of steel” – a person who has character, conviction

54:56.424 --> 55:01.050
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

55:01.425 --> 55:04.967
is a man of steel.

55:05.425 --> 55:13.633
So this magnet attracts the steel.

55:14.342 --> 55:21.008
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

55:22.466 --> 55:28.633
not pliable, it’s rather dry

55:31.050 --> 55:34.800
but the magnet attracts, means

55:36.175 --> 55:41.092
it creates that special quality in the steel

55:42.716 --> 55:45.842
that it moves towards the magnet.

55:50.925 --> 55:55.050
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

55:55.550 --> 55:58.466
you’ll be amazed.

55:58.967 --> 56:01.175
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

56:01.550 --> 56:03.259
they’ll be running towards you.

56:03.675 --> 56:07.967
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

56:08.716 --> 56:13.425
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

56:14.134 --> 56:19.384
– anywhere, any place.

56:19.758 --> 56:24.217
So what is this magnet?

56:25.008 --> 56:28.633
Is pure love.

56:29.342 --> 56:31.716
Is pure love

56:32.134 --> 56:36.842
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn’t depend

56:37.300 --> 56:41.092
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

56:41.508 --> 56:45.675
It is the support of itself.

56:46.300 --> 56:49.842
It’s like light that spreads just by its own nature,

56:50.300 --> 56:51.550
doesn’t want anything,

56:51.925 --> 56:53.758
doesn’t expect anything.

56:54.217 --> 56:59.842
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people’s hearts.

57:00.259 --> 57:06.134
That’s why they get attracted.

57:09.384 --> 57:11.800
Those who have not even seen Me,

57:12.300 --> 57:15.134
those who have not even known Me,

57:16.050 --> 57:18.175
just with My name, I’ve seen,

57:19.008 --> 57:22.716
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

57:23.300 --> 57:25.175
that they said, “We have to call the police”.

57:25.466 --> 57:27.217
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

57:27.425 --> 57:29.092
we'll manage somehow.”

57:29.342 --> 57:30.883
In Poona we had such crowds

57:30.883 --> 57:34.425
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

57:34.508 --> 57:38.008
He said, “Mother, I’ll give You very big area

57:38.300 --> 57:40.550
where You can sit down in a big open place

57:41.300 --> 57:44.300
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished.”

57:44.550 --> 57:47.508
I said, “You don’t worry,

57:47.967 --> 57:50.550
everything will be in proper place.”

57:50.967 --> 57:54.342
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

57:54.716 --> 57:59.300
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

57:59.716 --> 58:05.716
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

58:06.134 --> 58:08.967
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

58:09.300 --> 58:11.092
Just like a picture.

58:11.508 --> 58:15.384
No movement of hand, feet, eyes – nothing.

58:15.716 --> 58:19.800
Just sitting like a picture.

58:20.342 --> 58:23.591
And the gentleman who owned that hall

58:24.050 --> 58:28.092
had never seen such a thing before.

58:28.633 --> 58:31.342
Throughout for one and half hour,

58:32.259 --> 58:34.800
no movement of any kind.

58:37.883 --> 58:42.008
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

58:42.508 --> 58:47.342
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

58:47.758 --> 58:50.092
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

58:50.508 --> 58:55.175
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

58:55.508 --> 59:00.800
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

59:01.424 --> 59:11.800
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

59:13.050 --> 59:14.800
A child, there’s one child,

59:15.175 --> 59:18.633
everybody is attracted towards the child.

59:20.134 --> 59:23.508
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

59:24.050 --> 59:29.050
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

59:29.508 --> 59:31.716
everybody would be worried about the child.

59:32.175 --> 59:33.342
What’s happening to the child?

59:33.716 --> 59:38.633
They will not think: it’s an Arab child or an American child, no.

59:39.134 --> 59:43.675
Unless and until it’s a devil.

59:45.092 --> 59:47.050
Why this attraction for children?

59:47.466 --> 59:49.008
Because their magnets are intact.

59:49.425 --> 59:51.550
Their ego has not yet developed.

59:51.967 --> 59:55.008
Our ego developed, had to develop

59:55.425 --> 59:59.424
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.092
what is right and what is wrong.

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.550
So the ego developed was all right.

01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:09.716
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

01:00:10.259 --> 01:00:14.300
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

01:00:14.633 --> 01:00:16.591
overlapped the superego also.

01:00:17.008 --> 01:00:19.425
No conditioning, nothing.

01:00:19.967 --> 01:00:21.842
We’ll do whatever we like.

01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:24.384
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

01:00:24.758 --> 01:00:27.675
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:31.842
Then we’ll cut our hair or we’ll do this, we’ll do that.

01:00:32.424 --> 01:00:34.342
No conditioning of any kind.

01:00:34.758 --> 01:00:40.050
All superego was also covered – ego.

01:00:42.175 --> 01:00:46.925
This ego would have been all right

01:00:47.424 --> 01:00:51.883
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

01:00:52.508 --> 01:00:57.883
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

01:00:58.384 --> 01:01:04.466
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

01:01:05.134 --> 01:01:10.550
If you see a farmer and a big professor

01:01:11.008 --> 01:01:14.842
or a very well educated man

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.424
and talk to both of them. You’ll find the farmer

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:25.424
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

01:01:26.591 --> 01:01:29.675
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:31.758
He knows the living process.

01:01:32.217 --> 01:01:37.550
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

01:01:38.633 --> 01:01:43.883
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

01:01:44.342 --> 01:01:50.967
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

01:01:51.424 --> 01:01:56.175
ten ego-oriented people.

01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:03.550
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

01:02:04.008 --> 01:02:08.550
is that you become a wise person.

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:12.466
When you speak, people start looking at you.

01:02:12.842 --> 01:02:17.633
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

01:02:18.175 --> 01:02:29.342
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

01:02:30.716 --> 01:02:34.384
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

01:02:34.716 --> 01:02:38.550
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:42.217
is good for nothing.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:45.550
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

01:02:45.925 --> 01:02:49.591
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

01:02:50.092 --> 01:02:52.217
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:55.217
and hitting that person.

01:02:55.633 --> 01:02:58.050
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

01:02:58.425 --> 01:03:00.175
they say, “That bull, the same bull”.

01:03:00.591 --> 01:03:02.300
Everybody reports about the same bull.

01:03:02.758 --> 01:03:07.342
“Oh, that’s the one, all right.”

01:03:10.384 --> 01:03:15.425
So it grants you wisdom.

01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:20.175
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

01:03:20.591 --> 01:03:22.800
your eyes are radiant.

01:03:23.259 --> 01:03:27.758
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

01:03:28.384 --> 01:03:31.092
when He is enlightening you;

01:03:31.466 --> 01:03:41.217
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

01:03:41.842 --> 01:03:45.050
But this glance is so powerful

01:03:45.424 --> 01:03:48.758
that even one glance is sufficient

01:03:49.217 --> 01:03:54.134
to purify thousands of people.

01:03:55.883 --> 01:04:00.424
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

01:04:01.092 --> 01:04:04.925
and you find whole thing changes

01:04:05.424 --> 01:04:08.591
into a beautiful morning

01:04:09.008 --> 01:04:15.092
from a complete dark night.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.259
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:27.300
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

01:04:27.716 --> 01:04:32.300
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

01:04:32.883 --> 01:04:36.800
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

01:04:37.384 --> 01:04:45.758
He has to certify, “All right. Pass. Go,” on every chakra.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:48.425
And when the Kundalini rises,

01:04:48.842 --> 01:04:54.633
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:57.092
But then when He sleeps down,

01:04:57.466 --> 01:05:02.633
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

01:05:07.758 --> 01:05:10.092
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

01:05:10.466 --> 01:05:14.425
That’s not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

01:05:15.008 --> 01:05:22.508
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

01:05:22.967 --> 01:05:29.466
with something that cannot allow

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:34.008
Shri Ganesha’s principle to manifest in us.

01:05:34.508 --> 01:05:38.883
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

01:05:39.424 --> 01:05:44.217
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:50.716
That’s all, but it never dies.

01:05:51.259 --> 01:05:58.342
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

01:06:03.466 --> 01:06:07.800
The another quality of a person who is endowed

01:06:08.384 --> 01:06:12.050
with Shri Ganesha’s powers is that

01:06:12.466 --> 01:06:15.008
He removes all the hurdles.

01:06:15.384 --> 01:06:21.092
If one person of this nature is in some place,

01:06:21.591 --> 01:06:23.967
all the rest of the people who are nearby

01:06:24.384 --> 01:06:28.842
will be saved if there’s an accident or if there’s any problem,

01:06:29.424 --> 01:06:34.842
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:44.424
You will find this happening.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:51.800
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

01:06:52.466 --> 01:06:55.591
He guides you.

01:06:56.092 --> 01:06:58.925
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.217
He is the one who is Sahaja.

01:07:02.633 --> 01:07:07.050
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.008
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

01:07:10.425 --> 01:07:13.633
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

01:07:14.134 --> 01:07:17.175
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:25.342
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

01:07:27.425 --> 01:07:33.384
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

01:07:33.925 --> 01:07:41.591
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:45.425
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

01:07:45.883 --> 01:07:48.466
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

01:07:48.925 --> 01:07:50.633
because all the Gods and Goddesses

01:07:51.092 --> 01:07:55.300
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

01:07:55.716 --> 01:07:57.633
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

01:07:58.134 --> 01:07:59.384
He knows,

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:09.508
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

01:08:10.384 --> 01:08:13.424
To have all the powers of the world,

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.424
just keep the Mother pleased.

01:08:21.425 --> 01:08:24.591
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.050
which can be described.

01:08:27.466 --> 01:08:34.466
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

01:08:37.092 --> 01:08:43.633
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

01:08:44.092 --> 01:08:46.424
but He is the one who will tell you

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.300
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.925
That means He gives you the taste of love

01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:58.466
in the food that is cooked for you.

01:08:59.008 --> 01:09:02.716
Because He is love.

01:09:03.883 --> 01:09:09.883
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.

01:09:11.384 --> 01:09:14.008
Once they asked Me to sing a song.

01:09:14.424 --> 01:09:16.424
I used to sing very well once upon a time

01:09:16.883 --> 01:09:18.675
but then after lecturing so many times,

01:09:19.217 --> 01:09:21.134
you see I think I lost My voice.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:23.758
I couldn’t sing well, I thought so.

01:09:24.259 --> 01:09:27.050
One day they asked Me to sing a song

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:32.758
and I thought of some song and sang to them.

01:09:33.508 --> 01:09:38.633
And after a year or so in a program they said,

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.175
“Mother we want to sing You a song.”

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:44.716
This was a song unknown to everyone,

01:09:45.342 --> 01:09:47.384
I don’t know from where they got it,

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.550
from where they made the tune.

01:09:49.967 --> 01:09:53.425
They started singing the same song.

01:09:53.925 --> 01:09:58.675
And such joy, I mean, it all became waves of tears

01:09:59.092 --> 01:10:02.758
in My eyes. I couldn’t control My joy.

01:10:03.259 --> 01:10:08.134
Now all this feeling of joy

01:10:08.925 --> 01:10:14.342
comes from the devices produced by Shri Ganesha.

01:10:14.758 --> 01:10:21.050
He is busy creating relationships, beautiful.

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:26.092
How? In a birthday, a child’s birthday, what do we say?

01:10:26.466 --> 01:10:29.175
“All right, so tomorrow morning

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:33.716
there’s a bird is going to drop a present for you.”

01:10:34.716 --> 01:10:37.466
And then the child gets up and sees there’s no bird.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.008
It’s only Ganesha who has given the idea.

01:10:40.508 --> 01:10:45.217
We can say He is a Santa Claus.

01:10:45.925 --> 01:10:49.424
He gives you ways and methods and He tells you

01:10:49.925 --> 01:10:55.300
how to delicately build up relationships, pure relationships.

01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:07.259
How you hide, how you wrap a little present,

01:11:07.591 --> 01:11:14.092
just put it there and a person who has to take it, sees it,

01:11:14.716 --> 01:11:18.716
“Oh God.” And then you see that flowers

01:11:19.217 --> 01:11:22.508
which you suddenly bring out, you put them,

01:11:22.967 --> 01:11:28.800
is all Shri Ganesha’s efforts, His ways, His suggestions.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:35.883
Among the creation, flowers are expressing

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.716
Shri Ganesha’s essence.

01:11:40.134 --> 01:11:41.591
And the essence of Shri Ganesha

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:49.175
comes from the Mother Earth’s essence, is the fragrance.

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:55.758
So a person who is endowed

01:11:56.424 --> 01:12:00.424
with Shri Ganesha’s blessings has fragrance,

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:06.425
sometimes chandan, sometime roses,

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:12.925
sometimes these gardenia.

01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:17.259
You just don’t know from where the fragrance is coming.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:23.259
The fragrance is coming from Shri Ganesh

01:12:24.425 --> 01:12:30.175
and that is what is the magnet within you.

01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:37.883
Such a person is fragrant, absolutely fragrant all the time.

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:47.508
Shri Ganesha emits all kinds of fragrance from such a person.

01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:59.591
And that you can only feel when your Shri Ganesha is all right.

01:13:03.175 --> 01:13:08.384
There’s no end to the description of this great Deity within you.

01:13:08.758 --> 01:13:12.175
He’s just settled down there, He’s all the time there,

01:13:12.633 --> 01:13:17.217
waiting to be cleansed out, for Him to raise His head,

01:13:17.675 --> 01:13:20.925
like a lotus in the mud.

01:13:21.424 --> 01:13:24.092
You just help it out by respecting it

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:27.758
and He’ll be there, fragrant within you.

01:13:28.259 --> 01:13:31.800
So important for this country

01:13:32.342 --> 01:13:40.842
where we have raised our head without surrendering

01:13:41.424 --> 01:13:50.050
it to the Virata, to the collectivity, to Shri Krishna.

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:53.758
We have raised our head,

01:13:54.259 --> 01:13:58.591
with Shri Ganesha we bow down our head,

01:13:59.092 --> 01:14:04.134
for all the bounties that God has bestowed upon us.

01:14:04.633 --> 01:14:06.217
All arrogance will disappear at the

01:14:06.716 --> 01:14:09.008
Lotus Feet of Shri Ganesha.

01:14:09.217 --> 01:14:11.425
He’ll give us wisdom.

01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:14.092
He’ll give us sense to understand.

01:14:14.424 --> 01:14:17.050
He’ll give us power to overcome our arrogance

01:14:17.425 --> 01:14:18.842
that is within us.

01:14:19.633 --> 01:14:24.050
He’s the one who is the giver of knowledge.

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:26.675
He’s the one who is give us light.

01:14:27.175 --> 01:14:29.550
Many people in India also worship Shri Ganesha,

01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:33.134
go on “Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha,

01:14:33.633 --> 01:14:39.466
and do all kinds of funny things.

01:14:40.092 --> 01:14:44.550
That’s like cheating yourself unnecessarily.

01:14:45.134 --> 01:14:49.217
It’s so simple to establish Shri Ganesha within you.

01:14:49.675 --> 01:14:56.550
But understand that it is vital

01:14:57.217 --> 01:15:01.092
that you people who are Sahaja yogis

01:15:01.633 --> 01:15:05.008
should establish Shri Ganesha,

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:08.633
which is a silent power within you, doesn’t talk.

01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:13.466
It’s a silent power, which acts.

01:15:14.134 --> 01:15:18.466
Just a power that’s dynamic

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:25.550
without any noise, without any show.

01:15:26.842 --> 01:15:31.424
And that is what I would say that today

01:15:31.842 --> 01:15:37.883
when I have said all these things from My heart,

01:15:38.425 --> 01:15:43.842
you the Sahaja yogis will establish Shri Ganesha within you.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:49.425
And from you, you will emit such powers

01:15:49.925 --> 01:15:54.050
that others will be able to establish

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:57.758
their Shri Ganesha in this country.

01:15:58.424 --> 01:15:59.300
May God bless you.

01:18:23.925 --> 01:18:25.466
We’ll call her as Gauri.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:30.342
Today is Ganesha’s day so Gauri is the name.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:23.716
Hello.

01:19:57.424 --> 01:20:00.967
Now on a Diwali day to worship Shri Ganesha

01:20:01.424 --> 01:20:04.342
and also Shri Lakshmi on that day,

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:08.675
so today as we are worshipping Shri Ganesha also,

01:20:09.134 --> 01:20:10.842
we have to worship Shri Lakshmi,

01:20:11.259 --> 01:20:13.883
so I’ll call her as Lakshmi today.

01:20:14.217 --> 01:20:18.425
All right? Thank you.

01:20:30.633 --> 01:20:38.050
Look at this little baby, doesn’t cry. You’re such a big girl.

01:20:54.925 --> 01:20:57.384
But see the little babies do not cry.

01:20:57.716 --> 01:20:59.591
You’re a big girl …why are you crying?

01:21:00.008 --> 01:21:02.633
And what are you wearing on your feet? Let Me see.

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:06.259
Do they make a noise?

01:21:06.633 --> 01:21:07.384
No?

01:21:08.424 --> 01:21:09.925
So we can get you better ones.

01:21:10.217 --> 01:21:11.842
Let Me see how big your feet are.

01:21:12.259 --> 01:21:15.342
Let Me see. They’re very small, aren’t they.

01:21:15.716 --> 01:21:18.134
You are a big girl or a small girl?

01:21:18.550 --> 01:21:22.716
Small? No, no, she’s big, she can stand up, let's see?

01:21:23.134 --> 01:21:30.384
Let’s see. Hallo. Come along, come here.

01:21:38.425 --> 01:21:41.424
What’s the matter with her?

01:21:41.967 --> 01:21:46.342
She always like this?

01:21:47.134 --> 01:21:49.300
We’ll call her Siddhi. This is the power.

01:21:49.675 --> 01:21:51.675
Siddhi is a good name.

01:22:04.633 --> 01:22:08.300
All right. May God bless you.

01:22:08.424 --> 01:22:10.217
She’ll be all right.

01:22:35.466 --> 01:22:39.883
Look at that. Take a picture.

01:22:40.134 --> 01:22:44.425
May God bless you. May God bless you.

01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:48.008
Get up now. All right.

01:22:48.424 --> 01:22:51.800
You must get up. Come here. Come here. Aah.

01:22:52.175 --> 01:22:53.842
So now we’ll call him as Vinayaka.

01:22:54.175 --> 01:22:59.300
That’s the name of Shri Ganesha, Vinayaka.

01:23:08.508 --> 01:23:10.758
Who else is there?

01:23:15.758 --> 01:23:17.092
Come along.

01:23:40.842 --> 01:23:45.967
Hello. We’ll call him Ganapati.

01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:20.550
May God bless you.

01:24:21.424 --> 01:24:28.217
Come here. We’ll call them as Gauri and Ganesha.

01:24:32.508 --> 01:24:36.466
Gauri and Ganesha.

01:24:37.217 --> 01:24:38.758
Can you come?

01:25:00.217 --> 01:25:05.925
Ganesha’s another name is Omkara. We’ll call him Omkara.

01:25:08.050 --> 01:25:11.300
May God bless you.

01:25:13.175 --> 01:25:17.134
Come here. Good. You are Omkara now. All right?

01:25:17.466 --> 01:25:21.800
Good name, Omkara.

01:25:56.842 --> 01:25:58.967
So now...

01:26:02.384 --> 01:26:09.508
Ramma. Ramma is name of the Devi, name of Parvati.

01:26:17.466 --> 01:26:21.550
Is the name of the Mother of Ganesha, Ramma.

01:26:22.008 --> 01:26:31.842
Ramma is the one that plays in the heart.

01:26:38.050 --> 01:26:39.842
Janaki. Janaki.

01:27:44.716 --> 01:27:47.508
Sharmila, Sharmadayini, Sharmila, Sharmadayani

01:27:53.342 --> 01:27:54.842
Sharmadayani is the bliss-giver.

01:27:55.092 --> 01:27:59.134
Giver of bliss. Giver of bliss.

01:28:10.883 --> 01:28:12.550
Sharmila is the name of the Goddess.

01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:16.008
She’s the giver of bliss, Sharmadayani,

01:28:16.384 --> 01:28:19.466
is the giver of bliss. May God bless you.

01:29:46.342 --> 01:29:52.134
You can come here just to help with the puja.
