00:19:19.967 --> 00:19:24.550
Today in the land of Shri Krishna

00:19:25.758 --> 00:19:30.633
we are celebrating the birthday of Shri Ganesha.

00:19:33.259 --> 00:19:40.550
Is something very unprecedented

00:19:41.675 --> 00:19:51.967
and of a very significant value

00:19:55.134 --> 00:19:59.259
that you should be celebrating

00:20:02.508 --> 00:20:10.259
the birthday of Shri Krishna’s Son in His own land.

00:20:11.883 --> 00:20:14.466
You know that Shri Ganesha incarnated

00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.175
on this Earth as Mahavishnu

00:20:20.008 --> 00:20:25.591
and He was the Son of Radha,

00:20:28.134 --> 00:20:36.842
who incarnated as Lord Jesus Christ.

00:20:38.217 --> 00:20:41.758
So by celebrating this birthday

00:20:42.466 --> 00:20:46.425
today you are recognizing the greatest truth

00:20:46.842 --> 00:20:55.675
that Lord Jesus Christ was the son of Shri Krishna.

00:20:59.134 --> 00:21:04.758
There’s a story about it if you read in the Devi Mahatmayam,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:14.384
how this Primordial Child took a form of an egg

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:18.758
and half of it remained as Shri Ganesha

00:21:19.134 --> 00:21:26.425
and half of it became Mahavishnu.

00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:39.591
In the evolutionary process all these happenings

00:21:41.424 --> 00:21:45.092
of the antiquities

00:21:48.259 --> 00:21:50.758
have been recorded

00:21:50.842 --> 00:21:52.716
but today

00:21:55.008 --> 00:21:57.425
I feel so gratified that

00:21:57.758 --> 00:22:02.050
on the human level people have understood,

00:22:06.134 --> 00:22:14.758
Christ is the incarnation of Lord Ganesha.

00:22:15.633 --> 00:22:21.050
He is the Eternal Child

00:22:21.508 --> 00:22:25.842
but in the form when He came as Christ,

00:22:26.259 --> 00:22:33.259
He came as the son of Shri Krishna.

00:22:34.175 --> 00:22:40.342
But when Parvati made Shri Ganesha,

00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:46.424
He was the son of Parvati alone.

00:22:47.425 --> 00:22:50.342
There was no Father.

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:57.550
Parvati Herself wanted to have a child of Her own.

00:22:58.008 --> 00:23:03.425
There were angels who were dedicated

00:23:04.217 --> 00:23:07.633
either to Vishnu or to Shiva,

00:23:10.217 --> 00:23:16.342
like ganas were dedicated

00:23:20.342 --> 00:23:22.591
to Shiva alone.

00:23:23.384 --> 00:23:29.134
So, She wanted to have Her own Son

00:23:30.300 --> 00:23:32.384
who can

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:40.300
permeate

00:23:43.008 --> 00:23:47.758
Her powers on this Earth.

00:23:56.800 --> 00:24:03.508
So to begin with when the Shakti created this Universe

00:24:04.008 --> 00:24:08.092
and Sadashiva was watching Her creation,

00:24:08.424 --> 00:24:14.758
the first thing She created on this Earth was innocence

00:24:15.384 --> 00:24:21.424
and the embodiment of that innocence was Shri Ganesha.

00:24:23.883 --> 00:24:29.175
The whole Universe was covered with innocence,

00:24:29.591 --> 00:24:35.384
which we call as Omkara.

00:24:40.342 --> 00:24:49.424
This innocence protected all the creation of the world

00:24:49.883 --> 00:24:53.716
and penetrated into all that is matter.

00:24:54.050 --> 00:24:57.883
Matter is innocent.

00:25:01.217 --> 00:25:04.050
If you hit the matter, it will hit you back

00:25:04.466 --> 00:25:06.425
because it is built like that.

00:25:06.842 --> 00:25:10.758
It doesn’t want to harm you by any method

00:25:11.134 --> 00:25:13.342
except that if you try to hit it,

00:25:13.675 --> 00:25:20.092
it hits you back, in its own nature.

00:25:22.008 --> 00:25:24.675
So it was called as Jada,

00:25:25.008 --> 00:25:32.883
the one that acts according to the built-in nature.

00:25:36.217 --> 00:25:41.842
Innocence in the animals is of another kind,

00:25:42.425 --> 00:25:44.342
where the animals do not know

00:25:44.633 --> 00:25:47.675
that they are committing crimes.

00:25:48.092 --> 00:25:50.008
Animals

00:25:52.134 --> 00:25:56.425
when they say, kill an animal, another animal,

00:26:00.259 --> 00:26:02.883
or trespass your properties,

00:26:05.425 --> 00:26:07.466
create nuisance all over,

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.134
they don’t know they are committing a sin

00:26:10.425 --> 00:26:14.259
or they are disobeying some laws.

00:26:16.175 --> 00:26:21.758
They live with the laws that are built within them,

00:26:22.217 --> 00:26:26.716
that’s why they are called as pashus means bondage

00:26:27.050 --> 00:26:29.675
– the pasha. Pasha means the bondage.

00:26:30.092 --> 00:26:37.384
They are under the bondage of the laws of God.

00:26:42.175 --> 00:26:48.050
Shri Shiva is called as Pashupati.

00:26:48.424 --> 00:26:55.925
Up to that stage the innocence remains intact

00:26:58.633 --> 00:27:05.550
because there is no development of ego in them.

00:27:08.466 --> 00:27:10.883
So they are innocent.

00:27:11.259 --> 00:27:16.342
A tiger may eat a cow, still he is innocent

00:27:16.758 --> 00:27:19.175
or an elephant may trample

00:27:19.550 --> 00:27:25.842
over a human body, still he is innocent.

00:27:29.967 --> 00:27:36.508
But when going to a higher state,

00:27:39.259 --> 00:27:42.424
the Mother Shakti, the Primordial Mother thought

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:46.384
of creating a personality

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:53.883
who will protect the innocence of human beings.

00:27:54.384 --> 00:27:57.675
Above the matter, above the animals,

00:27:58.050 --> 00:28:02.466
She created Shri Ganesha.

00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.259
And you know the story of Shri Ganesha

00:28:05.633 --> 00:28:08.800
how He got the head of an elephant

00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:12.175
– symbolizing that Shri Ganesha,

00:28:12.550 --> 00:28:14.425
though He is a human being,

00:28:14.842 --> 00:28:18.716
He is like an animal as far as His head is concerned,

00:28:19.092 --> 00:28:24.633
that too of Shri Gajanana, in the sense that

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:30.217
He has got the head of an elephant

00:28:30.591 --> 00:28:37.800
which is the wisest animal in the animal kingdom.

00:28:38.716 --> 00:28:44.134
So in such a head, which is innocent,

00:28:44.466 --> 00:28:46.300
ego cannot develop.

00:28:46.716 --> 00:28:51.591
There is no ego. It’s an ego-less state.

00:28:53.092 --> 00:29:01.883
But human beings were created in a different manner

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:11.008
and when carbon was placed to create aminoacids,

00:29:13.008 --> 00:29:18.050
it also settled them in motion,

00:29:18.591 --> 00:29:23.508
a new type of evolution in human beings

00:29:24.092 --> 00:29:28.300
that at the Vishuddhi level human beings raised

00:29:28.591 --> 00:29:31.466
[his head] their heads like this.

00:29:31.967 --> 00:29:34.716
Animals’ heads are on the ground

00:29:35.384 --> 00:29:43.758
so the energy flows downward into Mother Earth

00:29:44.259 --> 00:29:47.466
but when man raised his head above,

00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:52.466
against the energy of gravity,

00:29:53.466 --> 00:30:00.342
then a new complication started in the energy flow

00:30:02.425 --> 00:30:05.425
and that is how at the Vishuddhi,

00:30:05.842 --> 00:30:11.384
a problem started where Kundalini

00:30:12.925 --> 00:30:15.384
could not

00:30:19.175 --> 00:30:21.050
nourish

00:30:21.424 --> 00:30:27.424
or look after that problematic Vishuddhi.

00:30:29.716 --> 00:30:33.550
The reason is when you raise your head

00:30:34.175 --> 00:30:36.342
from the Mother Earth,

00:30:36.758 --> 00:30:39.384
you remove yourself away

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.967
from the natural power of Mother Earth.

00:30:45.466 --> 00:30:50.716
When you take your Vishuddhi upward like that,

00:30:52.842 --> 00:30:55.300
you see the result of that in this country

00:30:55.716 --> 00:31:00.675
which is the country of Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:07.300
that you started going to machines which are against nature,

00:31:08.092 --> 00:31:10.466
extracting the nature,

00:31:11.175 --> 00:31:16.134
disturbing the nature by creating atomic bombs,

00:31:18.925 --> 00:31:23.466
by changing the atom, breaking it.

00:31:25.008 --> 00:31:28.134
That means you went against the nature itself

00:31:28.425 --> 00:31:31.925
by raising your head.

00:31:32.925 --> 00:31:36.217
But if it was done

00:31:39.425 --> 00:31:42.008
in complete surrender to God,

00:31:43.883 --> 00:31:48.342
with your bent head towards the Mother Earth,

00:31:48.758 --> 00:31:52.633
it would not have harmed you.

00:31:53.092 --> 00:32:01.300
But when you completely cut off yourself from that nature,

00:32:01.675 --> 00:32:06.425
which is so bountiful, which is so gracious.

00:32:06.925 --> 00:32:09.466
Yesterday you saw the beautiful pictures

00:32:09.842 --> 00:32:14.591
of the nature that surrounds you in this country.

00:32:15.466 --> 00:32:21.508
Such a rich country like America,

00:32:22.883 --> 00:32:27.716
without any gratitude towards its Creator

00:32:28.217 --> 00:32:30.883
raised its head upward

00:32:31.342 --> 00:32:36.591
– that’s how the Vishuddhi problem started coming up.

00:32:38.883 --> 00:32:45.050
In every walk of life, the whole social structure

00:32:45.508 --> 00:32:48.675
was built up to fight the nature,

00:32:49.092 --> 00:32:52.842
not to go along with the nature.

00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:59.675
So the first attack came on the innocence itself

00:33:01.008 --> 00:33:04.633
– on the Mooladhara itself.

00:33:05.175 --> 00:33:10.842
So the natural ways of Mooladhara were given up.

00:33:12.259 --> 00:33:20.466
Marriage system has been here much before Christ,

00:33:21.758 --> 00:33:29.300
much before Abraham, much before Moses

00:33:31.508 --> 00:33:41.758
and a sanctified marriage, which was blessed by the society,

00:33:44.425 --> 00:33:49.217
was acceptable since long.

00:33:50.175 --> 00:33:53.800
But man in his arrogance

00:33:54.217 --> 00:33:58.384
raised his voice against the marriage,

00:33:58.842 --> 00:34:06.425
against the natural way of leading a life of sanity.

00:34:08.008 --> 00:34:18.384
If it was natural to be the way people lead their private life,

00:34:19.425 --> 00:34:26.259
why do they get all kinds of diseases?

00:34:27.758 --> 00:34:31.425
If you are a natural person, you don’t get any diseases.

00:34:34.633 --> 00:34:37.134
Because you are anti-nature,

00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:42.925
that’s why

00:34:46.508 --> 00:34:50.175
in this country now many man and women were murdered

00:34:50.967 --> 00:34:53.050
for jealousy?

00:34:54.342 --> 00:34:57.050
If it was natural

00:34:58.008 --> 00:35:00.300
to be in love with ten men and ten women

00:35:02.092 --> 00:35:04.092
then why jealousy?

00:35:06.175 --> 00:35:11.384
You should be happy, it’s very natural.

00:35:14.384 --> 00:35:17.633
Because the head was raised at Vishuddhi Chakra

00:35:18.008 --> 00:35:23.591
without surrendering to Shri Krishna,

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:38.175
anti-life, anti-biotic atmosphere started growing.

00:35:41.466 --> 00:35:47.466
And this kind of life has taken this great country,

00:35:47.967 --> 00:35:54.050
now to the brink of complete destruction.

00:35:55.800 --> 00:36:00.134
The attack of innocence

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:06.134
is the greatest weakness of this country.

00:36:07.342 --> 00:36:16.384
Not to value the power of chastity and a chaste life

00:36:18.675 --> 00:36:26.050
is the biggest mistake that was created by the people

00:36:26.466 --> 00:36:31.508
who started all kinds of trends and fads.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:38.842
Ganesha is the root of Creation.

00:36:39.466 --> 00:36:43.259
When you go against Shri Ganesh

00:36:43.675 --> 00:36:48.508
you start losing your roots, you have no roots at all.

00:36:49.134 --> 00:36:53.550
Then you get drifted into anything stupid,

00:36:53.967 --> 00:36:58.842
anything new that comes up.

00:36:59.633 --> 00:37:07.134
So much so that a person like Freud was worshipped

00:37:08.008 --> 00:37:11.300
and they forgot Christ,

00:37:11.675 --> 00:37:15.466
who said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

00:37:15.967 --> 00:37:20.842
Ganesha to that level, that even the eyes have to be innocent.

00:37:21.300 --> 00:37:26.342
There should be no lust in your eyes.

00:37:29.175 --> 00:37:33.092
But arrogance

00:37:34.883 --> 00:37:36.842
made them feel, “What’s wrong?

00:37:37.758 --> 00:37:40.967
What’s wrong in this? What’s wrong in this?”

00:37:41.384 --> 00:37:49.050
Now the whole country is facing a great crisis

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:57.883
because of arrogant enterprises.

00:38:00.591 --> 00:38:11.092
Still they make a martyrdom out of all that is destructive.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:20.591
It’s a very great responsibility on the Sahaja yogis

00:38:20.925 --> 00:38:26.175
who live on the land of Shri Ganesha.

00:38:26.591 --> 00:38:36.925
But for the people who live in the land of Shri Krishna,

00:38:37.342 --> 00:38:45.384
the responsibility is absolutely on your neck

00:38:47.134 --> 00:38:52.425
and you can’t get out of it.

00:38:54.424 --> 00:38:57.633
Unless and until you understand the importance

00:38:58.008 --> 00:39:01.217
of innocence in your life

00:39:01.591 --> 00:39:07.175
you cannot save this country whatever I may try to do for it.

00:39:07.591 --> 00:39:11.925
It’s only you who are going to save it.

00:39:12.425 --> 00:39:19.883
It’s only you who are going to make it.

00:39:22.758 --> 00:39:24.758
When the Kundalini rises

00:39:25.424 --> 00:39:28.425
Shri Ganesha is awakened in you,

00:39:29.384 --> 00:39:34.424
the Ganesha whom you never respected,

00:39:35.259 --> 00:39:43.466
slowly comes up from His slumber,

00:39:44.134 --> 00:39:48.800
out of the hurt and the injuries inflicted on Him,

00:39:49.134 --> 00:39:52.800
still He stands up.

00:39:53.466 --> 00:39:54.300
But still weak,

00:39:58.508 --> 00:40:01.425
How are we going to nourish it?

00:40:01.883 --> 00:40:09.384
How are we going to look after its growth?

00:40:12.675 --> 00:40:20.175
The responsibility of Sahaja yogis of America is very great.

00:40:20.842 --> 00:40:25.925
They cannot cheat any more themselves.

00:40:26.384 --> 00:40:31.800
They cannot be satisfied with their arrogance.

00:40:32.259 --> 00:40:37.424
The mistakes have been grievous.

00:40:38.384 --> 00:40:43.092
So you have to take it up as a crusade

00:40:43.758 --> 00:40:45.925
against those mistakes

00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:51.550
and to establish your Shri Ganesha in a full form

00:40:52.175 --> 00:40:55.716
so that He gives you the necessary balance

00:40:55.716 --> 00:41:00.466
and the roots to nourish yourself.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:02.883
It is shocking first.

00:41:03.217 --> 00:41:06.425
I mean you just can’t understand;

00:41:07.300 --> 00:41:08.842
it is impossible

00:41:10.967 --> 00:41:16.342
to see how you could accept such absurd ideas;

00:41:19.675 --> 00:41:25.883
how you could take to such funny things,

00:41:29.466 --> 00:41:35.175
which are obviously horrid.

00:41:41.675 --> 00:41:46.217
Are we not aware of certain words like prostitution?

00:41:46.633 --> 00:41:48.591
And all other dirty words that they use,

00:41:48.967 --> 00:41:51.716
which I don’t want to say just now,

00:41:52.050 --> 00:41:56.883
or they have lost their meanings?

00:41:58.591 --> 00:42:04.550
We were all aware of it, we all knew about it.

00:42:05.259 --> 00:42:09.591
[Don’t do that … You should not.

00:42:10.050 --> 00:42:15.425
When I’m speaking must be quiet, all right?]

00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:22.384
Have we lost all wisdom from our minds

00:42:23.175 --> 00:42:26.384
that we cannot see

00:42:29.092 --> 00:42:31.842
what we have done to ourselves?

00:42:32.842 --> 00:42:37.466
We have no self-respect.

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:46.008
Arrogance to that limit is very dangerous,

00:42:47.424 --> 00:42:53.050
extremely unpredictable.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:57.175
And God knows what can come through

00:42:57.508 --> 00:43:04.466
with all these ventures we have gone into.

00:43:07.842 --> 00:43:10.259
I would say for Sahaja yogis,

00:43:10.591 --> 00:43:16.134
I have given some instructions with people

00:43:16.508 --> 00:43:23.217
– how they should respect their privacy of life,

00:43:27.466 --> 00:43:31.425
specially the women of America.

00:43:32.134 --> 00:43:35.217
If they have to be the shaktis,

00:43:35.716 --> 00:43:42.300
they have to respect their chastity.

00:43:43.967 --> 00:43:53.050
But so surprising that when we see outside

00:43:53.550 --> 00:43:59.092
all these things happening, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:59.716 --> 00:44:06.967
some of us try to be one of them who are going to hell.

00:44:07.883 --> 00:44:10.342
If you have to save them,

00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:19.466
then try to fix your positions, properly.

00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:26.550
Shri Ganesha has four hands

00:44:27.967 --> 00:44:35.466
and the hand that carries the destructive weapon of Parasha

00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:42.217
is the one you have to be careful about.

00:44:47.259 --> 00:44:49.800
That is His job

00:44:52.591 --> 00:44:54.967
and if you neglect Him,

00:44:57.384 --> 00:44:59.800
that force will act

00:45:01.466 --> 00:45:04.300
and act so vehemently

00:45:04.925 --> 00:45:07.424
that despite your realization

00:45:07.800 --> 00:45:12.633
you may not be able to save yourself.

00:45:13.259 --> 00:45:16.300
Do not take your realization for granted.

00:45:16.716 --> 00:45:19.300
Unless and until your Ganesha is settled,

00:45:19.633 --> 00:45:22.967
your realization has no meaning at all.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:25.591
Watch yourself,

00:45:27.008 --> 00:45:30.134
have you got adulterous eyes?

00:45:34.217 --> 00:45:39.466
Have you got an adulterous mind?

00:45:43.092 --> 00:45:49.967
What is your expectation about Sahaja Yoga?

00:45:51.217 --> 00:45:54.716
So many think that in Sahaja Yoga God blesses you,

00:45:55.134 --> 00:46:01.134
then you must get a good amount of health,

00:46:01.633 --> 00:46:03.424
money

00:46:06.883 --> 00:46:08.758
and position,

00:46:09.008 --> 00:46:10.842
power.

00:46:14.633 --> 00:46:21.967
The first thing you must ask for is the pure Ganesha,

00:46:22.342 --> 00:46:26.925
Nirmal Ganesha.

00:46:30.591 --> 00:46:35.925
“Oh, Mother, please give us

00:46:36.842 --> 00:46:42.425
the blessings of establishment of purity

00:46:43.384 --> 00:46:48.758
in our Ganesha principle.”

00:46:50.175 --> 00:46:51.675
In relationships,

00:46:56.716 --> 00:46:58.967
in attitudes,

00:47:02.675 --> 00:47:04.425
in behavior,

00:47:08.633 --> 00:47:13.217
try to judge yourself, are you innocent?

00:47:17.342 --> 00:47:25.050
Christ has said anything against Him may be tolerated

00:47:25.508 --> 00:47:30.842
but nothing against the Adi Shakti.

00:47:31.758 --> 00:47:37.466
But I must tell you as your Mother, it’s not true.

00:47:38.050 --> 00:47:42.259
Maybe against Me some things may be tolerated

00:47:42.716 --> 00:47:49.217
but nothing against Christ, the Lord,

00:47:49.716 --> 00:47:54.842
nothing against Lord Ganesha.

00:47:55.300 --> 00:48:00.758
Everything that is done against Him after realization

00:48:01.758 --> 00:48:05.675
will tell upon you

00:48:08.675 --> 00:48:13.800
and you’ll be thrown out of the realm of God,

00:48:14.925 --> 00:48:19.008
as absolutely degraded people.

00:48:19.425 --> 00:48:23.424
That is one thing that will not be tolerated,

00:48:23.842 --> 00:48:30.466
will not be forgiven, will never be acceptable.

00:48:32.342 --> 00:48:34.758
Whatever you have done in the past is finished now

00:48:35.175 --> 00:48:37.842
because you are a new bird.

00:48:38.259 --> 00:48:41.300
But after becoming this,

00:48:41.800 --> 00:48:48.175
if you try to take to these wrong ideas

00:48:49.134 --> 00:48:57.633
or to indulge into them, I cannot help you at all.

00:49:01.217 --> 00:49:06.550
After all Shri Ganesha is My Son

00:49:08.134 --> 00:49:12.259
because He is pure.

00:49:14.633 --> 00:49:18.134
Now He is not the only son I have.

00:49:18.508 --> 00:49:21.633
I have so many sons and daughters

00:49:22.008 --> 00:49:24.466
and I have made you in the same way

00:49:24.466 --> 00:49:28.758
as I created Shri Ganesha, without the Father,

00:49:29.342 --> 00:49:32.425
on My own.

00:49:35.758 --> 00:49:40.092
To your Mother nothing but purity of heart

00:49:40.425 --> 00:49:49.259
and purity of your body is going to please.

00:49:51.259 --> 00:49:55.008
Anything that is impure has to be thrown away.

00:49:55.384 --> 00:50:00.217
My name itself means purity.

00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:03.508
You can do it.

00:50:03.800 --> 00:50:05.425
You are empowered to do it.

00:50:05.758 --> 00:50:07.300
You have a Kundalini to do it.

00:50:07.633 --> 00:50:13.508
But the first thing you have to do is to cleanse that

00:50:15.675 --> 00:50:18.300
and the rest you don’t have to worry,

00:50:18.633 --> 00:50:22.633
Shri Ganesha will look after it.

00:50:23.175 --> 00:50:28.425
One chakra you keep clean, the rest is looked after.

00:50:30.800 --> 00:50:36.800
All your incurable diseases right from

00:50:39.716 --> 00:50:43.758
all muscular troubles like myelitis and all that,

00:50:44.092 --> 00:50:49.092
all your incurable diseases right from cancer onwards,

00:50:51.424 --> 00:50:54.134
all your psychosomatic problems

00:50:56.008 --> 00:50:59.008
right from schizophrenia, everything

00:50:59.758 --> 00:51:03.925
come because of the disturbance in Mooladhara.

00:51:07.384 --> 00:51:10.300
When the roots are not all right,

00:51:11.716 --> 00:51:14.591
how can you cure the tree?

00:51:15.175 --> 00:51:16.967
If the roots are all right

00:51:17.424 --> 00:51:21.342
then any medicine can reach any center,

00:51:22.008 --> 00:51:26.217
any area, any place, any fruit.

00:51:28.008 --> 00:51:30.633
But if the roots are not all right,

00:51:31.925 --> 00:51:34.134
how can you work it out?

00:51:36.591 --> 00:51:39.259
Today you have called Me here,

00:51:39.591 --> 00:51:44.466
to worship Shri Ganesha, within Me.

00:51:47.300 --> 00:51:53.425
Shri Ganesha within Me is a powerful identity.

00:51:55.217 --> 00:52:00.800
While worshipping Him you have to know

00:52:02.092 --> 00:52:07.675
that such a powerful thing

00:52:08.217 --> 00:52:12.175
you have to establish within yourself

00:52:13.758 --> 00:52:16.550
and by that establishment

00:52:19.092 --> 00:52:27.883
you have to manifest the powers of Shri Ganesha

00:52:32.259 --> 00:52:35.300
and the power of Shri Ganesha’s

00:52:37.466 --> 00:52:41.716
greatness is auspiciousness.

00:52:46.633 --> 00:52:51.342
It’s a coefficience;

00:52:52.424 --> 00:52:57.508
it’s a formula, we can say in scientific language,

00:52:58.217 --> 00:53:04.175
that emits auspiciousness.

00:53:09.508 --> 00:53:16.050
It’s a magnet in the Mother Earth.

00:53:17.217 --> 00:53:21.134
The same magnet is within you,

00:53:21.466 --> 00:53:23.425
which is Shri Ganesha.

00:53:23.716 --> 00:53:26.175
You leave Me alone and I can tell you

00:53:26.466 --> 00:53:33.800
which is the north, south, east, west.

00:53:34.466 --> 00:53:37.425
Close My eyes, still I’ll tell you.

00:53:37.842 --> 00:53:40.800
You know there are so many birds who fly out

00:53:41.175 --> 00:53:44.092
all the way to Australia, to Siberia

00:53:44.425 --> 00:53:46.550
because they have that magnet with them,

00:53:46.883 --> 00:53:48.883
they have that innocence with them.

00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:50.758
There are so many fishes,

00:53:51.134 --> 00:53:56.050
which have got actual magnet placed in them.

00:53:56.967 --> 00:53:59.259
Scientists should find out.

00:53:59.675 --> 00:54:07.550
In the same way Shri Ganesha within us is magnetic.

00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:17.092
So a person who has Shri Ganesha awakened within himself

00:54:18.300 --> 00:54:19.092
becomes magnetic

00:54:28.550 --> 00:54:34.716
and magnet attracts the steel

00:54:35.967 --> 00:54:41.300
– not dried leaves, does not – steel.

00:54:41.758 --> 00:54:45.217
And steel is like the Guru Tattwa.

00:54:45.633 --> 00:54:49.259
Is a man with the steel, say.

00:54:49.716 --> 00:54:55.925
“Man of steel” – a person who has character, conviction

00:54:56.424 --> 00:55:01.050
and who cannot be dominated by temptations,

00:55:01.425 --> 00:55:04.967
is a man of steel.

00:55:05.425 --> 00:55:13.633
So this magnet attracts the steel.

00:55:14.342 --> 00:55:21.008
Steel has only one badness, bad thing about it that it is

00:55:22.466 --> 00:55:28.633
not pliable, it’s rather dry

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:34.800
but the magnet attracts, means

00:55:36.175 --> 00:55:41.092
it creates that special quality in the steel

00:55:42.716 --> 00:55:45.842
that it moves towards the magnet.

00:55:50.925 --> 00:55:55.050
In the same way when this magnet is awakened within you,

00:55:55.550 --> 00:55:58.466
you’ll be amazed.

00:55:58.967 --> 00:56:01.175
Instead of people running away from your ashrams

00:56:01.550 --> 00:56:03.259
they’ll be running towards you.

00:56:03.675 --> 00:56:07.967
I find it impossible. I go to any house,

00:56:08.716 --> 00:56:13.425
if they come to know I am there, God save Me

00:56:14.134 --> 00:56:19.384
– anywhere, any place.

00:56:19.758 --> 00:56:24.217
So what is this magnet?

00:56:25.008 --> 00:56:28.633
Is pure love.

00:56:29.342 --> 00:56:31.716
Is pure love

00:56:32.134 --> 00:56:36.842
and the concept of pure love is that it doesn’t depend

00:56:37.300 --> 00:56:41.092
on anything whatsoever but on itself.

00:56:41.508 --> 00:56:45.675
It is the support of itself.

00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:49.842
It’s like light that spreads just by its own nature,

00:56:50.300 --> 00:56:51.550
doesn’t want anything,

00:56:51.925 --> 00:56:53.758
doesn’t expect anything.

00:56:54.217 --> 00:56:59.842
Just spreads all over and enlightens other people’s hearts.

00:57:00.259 --> 00:57:06.134
That’s why they get attracted.

00:57:09.384 --> 00:57:11.800
Those who have not even seen Me,

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.134
those who have not even known Me,

00:57:16.050 --> 00:57:18.175
just with My name, I’ve seen,

00:57:19.008 --> 00:57:22.716
places like Calcutta, we had such a problem, such crowds

00:57:23.300 --> 00:57:25.175
that they said, “We have to call the police”.

00:57:25.466 --> 00:57:27.217
I said, "There's no need to call the police but

00:57:27.425 --> 00:57:29.092
we'll manage somehow.”

00:57:29.342 --> 00:57:30.883
In Poona we had such crowds

00:57:30.883 --> 00:57:34.425
that the fellow who gave us the hall got a fright.

00:57:34.508 --> 00:57:38.008
He said, “Mother, I’ll give You very big area

00:57:38.300 --> 00:57:40.550
where You can sit down in a big open place

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:44.300
but I am sorry, my hall all will be finished.”

00:57:44.550 --> 00:57:47.508
I said, “You don’t worry,

00:57:47.967 --> 00:57:50.550
everything will be in proper place.”

00:57:50.967 --> 00:57:54.342
We had such crowds that people were sitting on the ground,

00:57:54.716 --> 00:57:59.300
on the staircase, everywhere and till I spoke

00:57:59.716 --> 00:58:05.716
nobody moved an inch, you see like a picture.

00:58:06.134 --> 00:58:08.967
And I spoke for one and a half hour.

00:58:09.300 --> 00:58:11.092
Just like a picture.

00:58:11.508 --> 00:58:15.384
No movement of hand, feet, eyes – nothing.

00:58:15.716 --> 00:58:19.800
Just sitting like a picture.

00:58:20.342 --> 00:58:23.591
And the gentleman who owned that hall

00:58:24.050 --> 00:58:28.092
had never seen such a thing before.

00:58:28.633 --> 00:58:31.342
Throughout for one and half hour,

00:58:32.259 --> 00:58:34.800
no movement of any kind.

00:58:37.883 --> 00:58:42.008
What is it, that working, is the magnet.

00:58:42.508 --> 00:58:47.342
Even if you are the steel, it will attract

00:58:47.758 --> 00:58:50.092
but if you are a magnet then it will attract

00:58:50.508 --> 00:58:55.175
in such a way that it will never leave this magnet.

00:58:55.508 --> 00:59:00.800
So, for yoga it is important that you fix up your magnets

00:59:01.424 --> 00:59:11.800
of Shri Ganesha who is the child-like personality.

00:59:13.050 --> 00:59:14.800
A child, there’s one child,

00:59:15.175 --> 00:59:18.633
everybody is attracted towards the child.

00:59:20.134 --> 00:59:23.508
One child gets stuck-up somewhere in the air,

00:59:24.050 --> 00:59:29.050
whether you are a Russian, American or an Arab,

00:59:29.508 --> 00:59:31.716
everybody would be worried about the child.

00:59:32.175 --> 00:59:33.342
What’s happening to the child?

00:59:33.716 --> 00:59:38.633
They will not think: it’s an Arab child or an American child, no.

00:59:39.134 --> 00:59:43.675
Unless and until it’s a devil.

00:59:45.092 --> 00:59:47.050
Why this attraction for children?

00:59:47.466 --> 00:59:49.008
Because their magnets are intact.

00:59:49.425 --> 00:59:51.550
Their ego has not yet developed.

00:59:51.967 --> 00:59:55.008
Our ego developed, had to develop

00:59:55.425 --> 00:59:59.424
because we had to decide in our own freedom,

00:59:59.800 --> 01:00:03.092
what is right and what is wrong.

01:00:03.550 --> 01:00:05.550
So the ego developed was all right.

01:00:05.967 --> 01:00:09.716
Up to a point we should have developed our ego.

01:00:10.259 --> 01:00:14.300
But we overdeveloped it and overdeveloped it,

01:00:14.633 --> 01:00:16.591
overlapped the superego also.

01:00:17.008 --> 01:00:19.425
No conditioning, nothing.

01:00:19.967 --> 01:00:21.842
We’ll do whatever we like.

01:00:22.217 --> 01:00:24.384
Today we are wearing a half-pant,

01:00:24.758 --> 01:00:27.675
tomorrow we will wear a long pant, all right.

01:00:28.050 --> 01:00:31.842
Then we’ll cut our hair or we’ll do this, we’ll do that.

01:00:32.424 --> 01:00:34.342
No conditioning of any kind.

01:00:34.758 --> 01:00:40.050
All superego was also covered – ego.

01:00:42.175 --> 01:00:46.925
This ego would have been all right

01:00:47.424 --> 01:00:51.883
if you had kept your Ganesha tattwa.

01:00:52.508 --> 01:00:57.883
And what is that is the wisdom power of Ganesha.

01:00:58.384 --> 01:01:04.466
The second power of Ganesha is that He gives you wisdom.

01:01:05.134 --> 01:01:10.550
If you see a farmer and a big professor

01:01:11.008 --> 01:01:14.842
or a very well educated man

01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:17.424
and talk to both of them. You’ll find the farmer

01:01:17.716 --> 01:01:25.424
has much more wisdom than this, MAD PhD.

01:01:26.591 --> 01:01:29.675
Why? Because he deals with Mother Earth everyday.

01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:31.758
He knows the living process.

01:01:32.217 --> 01:01:37.550
He knows about the innocence of the Mother Earth.

01:01:38.633 --> 01:01:43.883
So an innocent person is the wisest among ...

01:01:44.342 --> 01:01:50.967
A child who is innocent is much wiser than

01:01:51.424 --> 01:01:56.175
ten ego-oriented people.

01:01:58.424 --> 01:02:03.550
So the second capacity of Shri Ganesha

01:02:04.008 --> 01:02:08.550
is that you become a wise person.

01:02:08.925 --> 01:02:12.466
When you speak, people start looking at you.

01:02:12.842 --> 01:02:17.633
You speak like Kabira, you speak like Nanaka.

01:02:18.175 --> 01:02:29.342
You speak like something that makes people feel their spirit.

01:02:30.716 --> 01:02:34.384
This is what I call is a Sahaja yogi.

01:02:34.716 --> 01:02:38.550
A Sahaja yogi who does not have wisdom

01:02:39.050 --> 01:02:42.217
is good for nothing.

01:02:42.550 --> 01:02:45.550
He comes to Sahaja Yoga

01:02:45.925 --> 01:02:49.591
and he is like a bull in a china shop,

01:02:50.092 --> 01:02:52.217
goes on hitting this person, hitting that person

01:02:52.550 --> 01:02:55.217
and hitting that person.

01:02:55.633 --> 01:02:58.050
And when you ask these three wounded persons,

01:02:58.425 --> 01:03:00.175
they say, “That bull, the same bull”.

01:03:00.591 --> 01:03:02.300
Everybody reports about the same bull.

01:03:02.758 --> 01:03:07.342
“Oh, that’s the one, all right.”

01:03:10.384 --> 01:03:15.425
So it grants you wisdom.

01:03:16.967 --> 01:03:20.175
When you have the power of Shri Ganesha,

01:03:20.591 --> 01:03:22.800
your eyes are radiant.

01:03:23.259 --> 01:03:27.758
You get a spark in your eye, a light in your eye,

01:03:28.384 --> 01:03:31.092
when He is enlightening you;

01:03:31.466 --> 01:03:41.217
then you cannot look at anyone with lust and greed.

01:03:41.842 --> 01:03:45.050
But this glance is so powerful

01:03:45.424 --> 01:03:48.758
that even one glance is sufficient

01:03:49.217 --> 01:03:54.134
to purify thousands of people.

01:03:55.883 --> 01:04:00.424
Just the opening of the eyes are necessary

01:04:01.092 --> 01:04:04.925
and you find whole thing changes

01:04:05.424 --> 01:04:08.591
into a beautiful morning

01:04:09.008 --> 01:04:15.092
from a complete dark night.

01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.259
Glance can awaken the Kundalini.

01:04:24.175 --> 01:04:27.300
The Mother Kundalini cannot move,

01:04:27.716 --> 01:04:32.300
unless and until Shri Ganesha gives the permission.

01:04:32.883 --> 01:04:36.800
He is like the Vice-Chancellor sitting on all the chakras.

01:04:37.384 --> 01:04:45.758
He has to certify, “All right. Pass. Go,” on every chakra.

01:04:46.466 --> 01:04:48.425
And when the Kundalini rises,

01:04:48.842 --> 01:04:54.633
Shri Ganesha is awakened, otherwise Kundalini cannot rise.

01:04:55.175 --> 01:04:57.092
But then when He sleeps down,

01:04:57.466 --> 01:05:02.633
Kundalini sucks, is sucked by Him.

01:05:07.758 --> 01:05:10.092
Now we think we have lost our innocence.

01:05:10.466 --> 01:05:14.425
That’s not easy to be lost. It is not destructible.

01:05:15.008 --> 01:05:22.508
Only thing what you have done is to cover it

01:05:22.967 --> 01:05:29.466
with something that cannot allow

01:05:29.967 --> 01:05:34.008
Shri Ganesha’s principle to manifest in us.

01:05:34.508 --> 01:05:38.883
You have pushed it down. You have brought pressure on it.

01:05:39.424 --> 01:05:44.217
You have brought loads and loads of nonsense on it.

01:05:46.342 --> 01:05:50.716
That’s all, but it never dies.

01:05:51.259 --> 01:05:58.342
It is an eternal principle of the whole universe.

01:06:03.466 --> 01:06:07.800
The another quality of a person who is endowed

01:06:08.384 --> 01:06:12.050
with Shri Ganesha’s powers is that

01:06:12.466 --> 01:06:15.008
He removes all the hurdles.

01:06:15.384 --> 01:06:21.092
If one person of this nature is in some place,

01:06:21.591 --> 01:06:23.967
all the rest of the people who are nearby

01:06:24.384 --> 01:06:28.842
will be saved if there’s an accident or if there’s any problem,

01:06:29.424 --> 01:06:34.842
which is destructive, all of them will be saved.

01:06:41.050 --> 01:06:44.424
You will find this happening.

01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:51.800
He being the Ganapati, He is now the Master of all the Ganas.

01:06:52.466 --> 01:06:55.591
He guides you.

01:06:56.092 --> 01:06:58.925
Sahaja yoga cannot workout without Shri Ganesha.

01:06:59.300 --> 01:07:02.217
He is the one who is Sahaja.

01:07:02.633 --> 01:07:07.050
He is the one who creates all spontaneity of the world.

01:07:07.550 --> 01:07:10.008
He is the one who takes you to the right path.

01:07:10.425 --> 01:07:13.633
He is the one who gives you everything easily.

01:07:14.134 --> 01:07:17.175
He is the one who creates all the chamatkars,

01:07:17.550 --> 01:07:25.342
all the magic, all the miracles of the world.

01:07:27.425 --> 01:07:33.384
He is the Ganapati. He is the one who is sitting on Ganas,

01:07:33.925 --> 01:07:41.591
in the sense that He is like the king of all the Ganas.

01:07:43.633 --> 01:07:45.425
The one who has pleased Shri Ganesha

01:07:45.883 --> 01:07:48.466
has pleased all the Gods and Goddesses

01:07:48.925 --> 01:07:50.633
because all the Gods and Goddesses

01:07:51.092 --> 01:07:55.300
are pleasing Shri Ganesha, so what is the need?

01:07:55.716 --> 01:07:57.633
And Shri Ganesha is very clever.

01:07:58.134 --> 01:07:59.384
He knows,

01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:09.508
please His Mother is the only simple thing He has to do.

01:08:10.384 --> 01:08:13.424
To have all the powers of the world,

01:08:13.800 --> 01:08:18.424
just keep the Mother pleased.

01:08:21.425 --> 01:08:24.591
There are so many qualities of Shri Ganesha,

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:27.050
which can be described.

01:08:27.466 --> 01:08:34.466
He is the one who gives us the joy of eating.

01:08:37.092 --> 01:08:43.633
If you eat some food, you may like it, you may not like it

01:08:44.092 --> 01:08:46.424
but He is the one who will tell you

01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:50.300
this is made by Sahaja yogis, made by your Mother.

01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:54.925
That means He gives you the taste of love

01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:58.466
in the food that is cooked for you.

01:08:59.008 --> 01:09:02.716
Because He is love.

01:09:03.883 --> 01:09:09.883
He gives you the ideas how to express your love.

01:09:11.384 --> 01:09:14.008
Once they asked Me to sing a song.

01:09:14.424 --> 01:09:16.424
I used to sing very well once upon a time

01:09:16.883 --> 01:09:18.675
but then after lecturing so many times,

01:09:19.217 --> 01:09:21.134
you see I think I lost My voice.

01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:23.758
I couldn’t sing well, I thought so.

01:09:24.259 --> 01:09:27.050
One day they asked Me to sing a song

01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:32.758
and I thought of some song and sang to them.

01:09:33.508 --> 01:09:38.633
And after a year or so in a program they said,

01:09:39.050 --> 01:09:41.175
“Mother we want to sing You a song.”

01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:44.716
This was a song unknown to everyone,

01:09:45.342 --> 01:09:47.384
I don’t know from where they got it,

01:09:47.883 --> 01:09:49.550
from where they made the tune.

01:09:49.967 --> 01:09:53.425
They started singing the same song.

01:09:53.925 --> 01:09:58.675
And such joy, I mean, it all became waves of tears

01:09:59.092 --> 01:10:02.758
in My eyes. I couldn’t control My joy.

01:10:03.259 --> 01:10:08.134
Now all this feeling of joy

01:10:08.925 --> 01:10:14.342
comes from the devices produced by Shri Ganesha.

01:10:14.758 --> 01:10:21.050
He is busy creating relationships, beautiful.

01:10:21.425 --> 01:10:26.092
How? In a birthday, a child’s birthday, what do we say?

01:10:26.466 --> 01:10:29.175
“All right, so tomorrow morning

01:10:29.550 --> 01:10:33.716
there’s a bird is going to drop a present for you.”

01:10:34.716 --> 01:10:37.466
And then the child gets up and sees there’s no bird.

01:10:37.967 --> 01:10:40.008
It’s only Ganesha who has given the idea.

01:10:40.508 --> 01:10:45.217
We can say He is a Santa Claus.

01:10:45.925 --> 01:10:49.424
He gives you ways and methods and He tells you

01:10:49.925 --> 01:10:55.300
how to delicately build up relationships, pure relationships.

01:11:02.466 --> 01:11:07.259
How you hide, how you wrap a little present,

01:11:07.591 --> 01:11:14.092
just put it there and a person who has to take it, sees it,

01:11:14.716 --> 01:11:18.716
“Oh God.” And then you see that flowers

01:11:19.217 --> 01:11:22.508
which you suddenly bring out, you put them,

01:11:22.967 --> 01:11:28.800
is all Shri Ganesha’s efforts, His ways, His suggestions.

01:11:30.050 --> 01:11:35.883
Among the creation, flowers are expressing

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.716
Shri Ganesha’s essence.

01:11:40.134 --> 01:11:41.591
And the essence of Shri Ganesha

01:11:42.050 --> 01:11:49.175
comes from the Mother Earth’s essence, is the fragrance.

01:11:51.050 --> 01:11:55.758
So a person who is endowed

01:11:56.424 --> 01:12:00.424
with Shri Ganesha’s blessings has fragrance,

01:12:00.883 --> 01:12:06.425
sometimes chandan, sometime roses,

01:12:07.050 --> 01:12:12.925
sometimes these gardenia.

01:12:13.591 --> 01:12:17.259
You just don’t know from where the fragrance is coming.

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:23.259
The fragrance is coming from Shri Ganesh

01:12:24.425 --> 01:12:30.175
and that is what is the magnet within you.

01:12:31.550 --> 01:12:37.883
Such a person is fragrant, absolutely fragrant all the time.

01:12:40.050 --> 01:12:47.508
Shri Ganesha emits all kinds of fragrance from such a person.

01:12:52.716 --> 01:12:59.591
And that you can only feel when your Shri Ganesha is all right.

01:13:03.175 --> 01:13:08.384
There’s no end to the description of this great Deity within you.

01:13:08.758 --> 01:13:12.175
He’s just settled down there, He’s all the time there,

01:13:12.633 --> 01:13:17.217
waiting to be cleansed out, for Him to raise His head,

01:13:17.675 --> 01:13:20.925
like a lotus in the mud.

01:13:21.424 --> 01:13:24.092
You just help it out by respecting it

01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:27.758
and He’ll be there, fragrant within you.

01:13:28.259 --> 01:13:31.800
So important for this country

01:13:32.342 --> 01:13:40.842
where we have raised our head without surrendering

01:13:41.424 --> 01:13:50.050
it to the Virata, to the collectivity, to Shri Krishna.

01:13:50.591 --> 01:13:53.758
We have raised our head,

01:13:54.259 --> 01:13:58.591
with Shri Ganesha we bow down our head,

01:13:59.092 --> 01:14:04.134
for all the bounties that God has bestowed upon us.

01:14:04.633 --> 01:14:06.217
All arrogance will disappear at the

01:14:06.716 --> 01:14:09.008
Lotus Feet of Shri Ganesha.

01:14:09.217 --> 01:14:11.425
He’ll give us wisdom.

01:14:11.925 --> 01:14:14.092
He’ll give us sense to understand.

01:14:14.424 --> 01:14:17.050
He’ll give us power to overcome our arrogance

01:14:17.425 --> 01:14:18.842
that is within us.

01:14:19.633 --> 01:14:24.050
He’s the one who is the giver of knowledge.

01:14:24.550 --> 01:14:26.675
He’s the one who is give us light.

01:14:27.175 --> 01:14:29.550
Many people in India also worship Shri Ganesha,

01:14:30.008 --> 01:14:33.134
go on “Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha, Shri Ganesha,

01:14:33.633 --> 01:14:39.466
and do all kinds of funny things.

01:14:40.092 --> 01:14:44.550
That’s like cheating yourself unnecessarily.

01:14:45.134 --> 01:14:49.217
It’s so simple to establish Shri Ganesha within you.

01:14:49.675 --> 01:14:56.550
But understand that it is vital

01:14:57.217 --> 01:15:01.092
that you people who are Sahaja yogis

01:15:01.633 --> 01:15:05.008
should establish Shri Ganesha,

01:15:05.550 --> 01:15:08.633
which is a silent power within you, doesn’t talk.

01:15:09.175 --> 01:15:13.466
It’s a silent power, which acts.

01:15:14.134 --> 01:15:18.466
Just a power that’s dynamic

01:15:19.050 --> 01:15:25.550
without any noise, without any show.

01:15:26.842 --> 01:15:31.424
And that is what I would say that today

01:15:31.842 --> 01:15:37.883
when I have said all these things from My heart,

01:15:38.425 --> 01:15:43.842
you the Sahaja yogis will establish Shri Ganesha within you.

01:15:44.300 --> 01:15:49.425
And from you, you will emit such powers

01:15:49.925 --> 01:15:54.050
that others will be able to establish

01:15:54.425 --> 01:15:57.758
their Shri Ganesha in this country.

01:15:58.424 --> 01:15:59.300
May God bless you.

01:18:23.925 --> 01:18:25.466
We’ll call her as Gauri.

01:18:25.967 --> 01:18:30.342
Today is Ganesha’s day so Gauri is the name.

01:19:23.008 --> 01:19:23.716
Hello.

Look at this little baby, doesn’t cry. You’re such a big girl.

01:20:54.925 --> 01:20:57.384
But see the little babies do not cry.

01:20:57.716 --> 01:20:59.591
You’re a big girl …why are you crying?

01:21:00.008 --> 01:21:02.633
And what are you wearing on your feet? Let Me see.

01:21:03.092 --> 01:21:06.259

01:22:04.633 --> 01:22:08.300
