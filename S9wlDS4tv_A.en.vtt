00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:09.280
I was very happy to learn that this morning
the meditation was done very well collectively.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.000
My attention was there on you.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:40.680
We are now going to announce the marriages,
the remaining ones today.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:49.559
Before that, I’ve to say the same thing
which I’ve said many times, that there is

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:58.600
no compulsion for anyone, not at all, to marry
a particular person who we have suggested.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.160
If you want, you can say no, completely, or
you can say “Mother, change it”.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.470
Whatever you say we’ll try to do.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:15.270
We have big problems of hights, of education,
of culture, and some people say: “We don’t

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.700
want to marry indians”, or “we don’t
want to marry a foreigner”, like that.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.480
Whatever it was, we have tried to comply with
your desires.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.840
But of course we could not get all of you
married because there were no proper matches

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:38.980
for you, but in any case I’m sure by tomorrow
we might be able to organize many more.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:53.680
So there is no compulsion about it, absolutely
not, till the end.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:05.140
Till the marriages are being performed you
have every right to say no, so I don’t want

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.800
you to get married now and later on create
problems.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.060
Whatever it is, if you think I have done anything
for you, or Sahaja Yoga has done for you,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.600
then please don’t trouble us by thinking
about it later on that “We don’t want

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:31.980
to marry, we didn’t like, it was like that”,
which is more with the western people, I must say.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.860
Moreover in India if you marry some indian
girls, you see it’s very difficult to neutralize

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.160
such marriages because the whole society will
get after Sahaja Yoga, they’ll get after My life.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.890
They have done so many thing like that, and
for somebody who just gets kind of a king

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.480
in the head and he decides that I will not
marry this girl.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.370
This is the girl, he’s with her, he knows
us very well, and then suddenly after getting

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.370
married he says: “No, no, no, no.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.460
I’m in love with somebody else”, or something
like that nonsensical.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.760
It’s very difficult for indians to understand
this kind of character.

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:18.510
So first, you fully understand, know the person.

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.250
There are still three, four days, meet the
person.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:29.810
If you don’t want to marry that person,
please, please cancel the marriage.

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.950
We have seen the vibrations, and we have seen
other things also, superficial things like

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.690
hight and education.

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:45.000
But it sometimes it happens that it doesn’t
match because of maybe the age or because

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.370
of maybe education, so we have adjusted so
many cases like that.

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.460
I must say it’s all open.

00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:01.560
You are not to accept anything again and again,
I’ll tell you, and make later on somebody

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.580
miserable, and hurt the person’s feelings,
or trouble Me.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.200
At least you should not trouble Me, that’s
all I want.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:15.720
You are all welcome to say no.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:18.590
I’m not going to feel bad, at all.

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.980
It’s perfectly alright, you are being honest.

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:27.600
But not at the last minute you start cancelling
when the girl is standing with the garland in her hands.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:35.000
Ah, they have done it, even after marriages
they have done it.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.380
I need not tell this to indians because they
understand this.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.120
Marriage in Sahaja Yoga is not a joke.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:50.300
You are very, very fortunate that these marriages
are taking place in My presence in Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:54.960
You must have done lots of punyas to have
this marriage.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:01.040
Apart from that, the children you’ll get,
and the whole blessings you’ll get will

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:09.780
be very unique and you’ll be surprised you’ll
always feel what Mother has done for you.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:17.840
Then even after marriage, some people try
to torture the wife or the wife tortures the husband.

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:20.500
This is not Sahaj.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:29.400
In the Sahaj thing one should not torture
anybody else who is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:38.020
You are not allowed to say even a harsh word
to somebody who is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:44.340
Somebody who calls Me Mother, and later on
tries to trouble Me, nothing happens to him,

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.760
it goes on troubling, troubling, nothing will
happen, but if he is not a sahaja yogi, inmediately

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.990
this Chaitanya punishes.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.940
So I keep the maryadas of My love.

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:04.780
In the same way, try to understand it’s
a very holy thing you are doing, and don’t

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:13.160
go about misbehaving in a manner that all
the deities will be angry with you.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.460
You can never rise.

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:19.340
But if you don’t like something, please
tell Me.

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.300
That’s much better because, see, there are
so many conditionings you have got.

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.400
We also have done it in a great hurry the
whole thing, so maybe, I don’t say that

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.920
we could not have made mistakes.

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:42.060
Could have been made some mistakes, in any
case take a very, very relaxed attitude towards it.

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:47.530
This is now what you’ll hear, the names
of the people who are remaining, most of them

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:53.419
we have announced, some who were left behind
we are telling.

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:59.870
Unfortunately always the women are more than
men are.

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:04.320
I find it difficult, so one should not feel
disappointed.

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.060
I’m sure it will work out later on.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.800
May God bless you.
