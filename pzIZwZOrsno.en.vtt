Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

00:02:21.654 --> 00:02:25.305
Today we have gathered to do the puja of Fatima Bi,

00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:29.830
who was the symbol of Gruha Laxmi,

00:02:30.882 --> 00:02:33.572
and so we are going to have the puja

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.203
of the Gruha Laxmi principle within us.

00:02:40.218 --> 00:02:43.542
As the housewife has to finish every work,

00:02:44.207 --> 00:02:47.547
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

00:02:48.183 --> 00:02:52.147
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

00:02:52.533 --> 00:02:55.445
and then I could come for your puja,

00:02:55.803 --> 00:02:58.592
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

00:02:59.047 --> 00:03:02.491
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:10.786
Now, the principle of Gruha Laxmi

00:03:12.298 --> 00:03:16.857
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:20.574
it’s not a human being’s creation

00:03:23.731 --> 00:03:27.193
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

00:03:30.261 --> 00:03:36.431
The Gruha Laxmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

00:03:36.683 --> 00:03:41.032
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.894
Now She is always born in a relationship

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:57.560
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.530
So She comes as sister or

00:04:01.788 --> 00:04:04.946
She comes as a daughter.

00:04:08.413 --> 00:04:11.055
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

00:04:12.648 --> 00:04:15.941
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

00:04:17.662 --> 00:04:22.614
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

00:04:24.788 --> 00:04:26.954
the religion into their hands

00:04:27.232 --> 00:04:30.784
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

00:04:32.308 --> 00:04:34.995
The attention was not paid so much

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:38.299
towards the ascent of the person.

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:43.645
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

00:04:44.351 --> 00:04:46.288
And He is the only one -

00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:50.574
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

00:04:52.287 --> 00:04:54.842
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

00:04:54.906 --> 00:04:57.159
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

00:04:57.548 --> 00:05:02.458
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
[brother of Jnaneshwara],

00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:05.950
which, you can go to Pune,

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.013
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

00:05:42.092 --> 00:05:46.480
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

00:05:47.478 --> 00:05:52.511
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

00:05:56.067 --> 00:06:00.465
She stayed in her house, in her household

00:06:01.061 --> 00:06:05.026
and She observed what you call

00:06:05.466 --> 00:06:09.409
a kind of a panda
[? Pata: veil]

00:06:09.536 --> 00:06:14.397
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

00:06:16.019 --> 00:06:18.401
It is a symbol that a woman

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.262
who is a housewife has to

00:06:28.307 --> 00:06:35.162
save her chastity by covering her face because

00:06:35.594 --> 00:06:38.847
She was a beautiful woman and

00:06:40.303 --> 00:06:46.531
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:50.473
and She would have been definitely attacked

00:06:50.973 --> 00:06:55.008
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:58.124
As you know, in the time of Christ,

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:02.722
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

00:07:03.072 --> 00:07:06.314
had to be very, very potential personality

00:07:06.989 --> 00:07:10.866
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

00:07:13.883 --> 00:07:17.231
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

00:07:18.651 --> 00:07:24.047
so She allowed her sons

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:27.186
or actually ordered them

00:07:28.316 --> 00:07:30.699
to fight those fanatics

00:07:31.372 --> 00:07:36.634
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

00:07:38.186 --> 00:07:41.710
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

00:07:42.498 --> 00:07:45.412
It’s a very beautiful thing how

00:07:46.379 --> 00:07:48.918
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:53.032
took a form of Vishnumaya

00:07:56.125 --> 00:08:02.444
just to establish the beautiful principle of

00:08:06.659 --> 00:08:09.143
a housewife.

00:08:11.227 --> 00:08:14.123
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

00:08:14.978 --> 00:08:17.930
and She knew that her children will be killed.

00:08:20.428 --> 00:08:23.342
But these people are never killed,

00:08:23.700 --> 00:08:26.757
they never die nor do they suffer.

00:08:26.925 --> 00:08:30.419
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

00:08:31.645 --> 00:08:34.541
As a result of that,

00:08:37.119 --> 00:08:42.033
another system started where they respected saints;

00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:48.214
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

00:08:48.726 --> 00:08:50.950
or we can call them the people

00:08:51.188 --> 00:08:54.095
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

00:08:54.675 --> 00:08:58.519
Then we have got “Chisti”.

00:08:58.808 --> 00:09:04.773
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

00:09:05.196 --> 00:09:08.729
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:13.464
But still they could not transcend

00:09:13.887 --> 00:09:20.186
the limits of religiosity.

00:09:21.594 --> 00:09:24.953
So they also became extremely fanatic.

00:09:25.707 --> 00:09:30.775
Firstly they would not see to

00:09:31.439 --> 00:09:34.994
another religion where they had saints.

00:09:35.329 --> 00:09:39.405
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:46.355
and even when we had a great saint

00:09:47.019 --> 00:09:52.115
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

00:09:53.897 --> 00:09:59.054
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

00:09:59.277 --> 00:10:03.453
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

00:10:04.886 --> 00:10:09.395
We did not deny,

00:10:09.690 --> 00:10:12.170
as far as Hindus were concerned,

00:10:12.871 --> 00:10:18.000
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

00:10:18.925 --> 00:10:22.465
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

00:10:22.834 --> 00:10:25.658
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

00:10:26.378 --> 00:10:31.578
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

00:10:31.953 --> 00:10:35.511
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

00:10:35.641 --> 00:10:38.196
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

00:10:39.718 --> 00:10:41.947
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

00:10:42.871 --> 00:10:49.188
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

00:10:50.037 --> 00:10:54.205
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

00:10:54.693 --> 00:10:56.527
So they could not get out of it.

00:10:56.789 --> 00:10:59.967
So we have another one called Haji Malang

00:11:00.102 --> 00:11:03.715
who was worshipped by Hindus.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.354
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

00:11:10.151 --> 00:11:12.472
This Haji Malang

00:11:13.116 --> 00:11:17.736
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

00:11:18.179 --> 00:11:22.154
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

00:11:22.703 --> 00:11:24.713
just to counter balance.

00:11:25.047 --> 00:11:26.969
They did all kinds of things.

00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:30.012
There are many saints like that.

00:11:31.293 --> 00:11:37.121
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

00:11:37.733 --> 00:11:43.350
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

00:11:44.396 --> 00:11:46.961
of that place, which was very bad. Even

00:11:47.207 --> 00:11:51.114
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

00:11:51.805 --> 00:11:53.768
They all make an earnings,

00:11:53.919 --> 00:11:57.365
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

00:11:58.895 --> 00:12:04.510
So this saint died and was buried there.

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.165
There were many people who were depending on it.

00:12:07.313 --> 00:12:10.816
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

00:12:11.776 --> 00:12:13.986
'What is your religion?'

00:12:14.745 --> 00:12:16.388
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:19.993
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

00:12:20.369 --> 00:12:22.877
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

00:12:24.437 --> 00:12:28.106
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

00:12:28.297 --> 00:12:30.209
They have no religions.

00:12:32.245 --> 00:12:36.284
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

00:12:36.741 --> 00:12:40.148
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

00:12:40.805 --> 00:12:43.678
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

00:12:43.734 --> 00:12:47.466
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

00:12:47.673 --> 00:12:50.185
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

00:12:50.463 --> 00:12:52.950
that they made a fanatic group.

00:12:53.731 --> 00:12:58.135
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

00:12:59.023 --> 00:13:02.381
against your innate religion within your-self

00:13:02.739 --> 00:13:05.238
because it creates poison.

00:13:06.966 --> 00:13:09.117
It's a venomous thing.

00:13:10.009 --> 00:13:12.540
It makes you hate others.

00:13:13.323 --> 00:13:15.609
When you start hating others,

00:13:16.104 --> 00:13:19.659
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

00:13:20.140 --> 00:13:24.395
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

00:13:28.338 --> 00:13:30.451
Hating any one

00:13:31.041 --> 00:13:34.644
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

00:13:34.796 --> 00:13:38.146
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

00:13:38.515 --> 00:13:40.969
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.630
They bite some one because that is their nature.

00:13:43.871 --> 00:13:46.404
They cut some one because that's their nature.

00:13:46.683 --> 00:13:48.628
They never hate someone.

00:13:48.924 --> 00:13:52.576
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

00:13:52.746 --> 00:13:57.946
is a speciality of human conception

00:13:58.154 --> 00:14:01.656
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

00:14:04.257 --> 00:14:07.005
And this horrible thing hatred

00:14:08.236 --> 00:14:12.182
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

00:14:12.735 --> 00:14:17.101
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

00:14:17.994 --> 00:14:22.424
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

00:14:22.548 --> 00:14:24.895
in every religion.

00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:29.282
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

00:14:29.458 --> 00:14:35.261
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

00:14:36.057 --> 00:14:41.344
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

00:14:42.056 --> 00:14:47.184
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

00:14:47.425 --> 00:14:51.863
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

00:14:54.544 --> 00:14:59.246
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

00:15:00.405 --> 00:15:03.079
to overcome that hatred,

00:15:03.548 --> 00:15:08.497
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

00:15:09.044 --> 00:15:12.454
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

00:15:12.672 --> 00:15:16.838
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

00:15:17.716 --> 00:15:23.067
How? In the family when you have a household,

00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:32.379
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

00:15:32.804 --> 00:15:39.331
between the children, between the husband and the children.

00:15:39.931 --> 00:15:44.575
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

00:15:45.261 --> 00:15:48.160
then how can she subdue it?

00:15:48.359 --> 00:15:53.378
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

00:15:53.650 --> 00:15:56.580
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

00:15:56.757 --> 00:15:59.614
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

00:16:00.234 --> 00:16:05.280
But the housewife's job is to smooth

00:16:06.474 --> 00:16:13.662
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

00:16:17.345 --> 00:16:20.249
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

00:16:20.506 --> 00:16:24.140
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.604
'wherever the housewife is respected,

00:16:28.426 --> 00:16:31.180
there only the Gods reside'.

00:16:34.041 --> 00:16:38.226
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

00:16:39.382 --> 00:16:41.652
because we are no good for economics,

00:16:41.677 --> 00:16:44.678
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.483
Men folk are useless,

00:16:46.668 --> 00:16:49.429
they don't know any household work or anything,

00:16:49.557 --> 00:16:52.985
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

00:16:53.128 --> 00:16:55.658
is maintained by the women of the household.

00:16:58.035 --> 00:17:02.831
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

00:17:04.422 --> 00:17:08.370
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

00:17:08.537 --> 00:17:11.865
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

00:17:13.402 --> 00:17:17.786
It's like the preservation of that

00:17:20.790 --> 00:17:24.608
principle of a housewife.

00:17:26.799 --> 00:17:29.774
But some men, I mean many of them,

00:17:30.181 --> 00:17:34.445
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

00:17:36.037 --> 00:17:38.846
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

00:17:40.590 --> 00:17:43.454
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:47.715
But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

00:17:47.896 --> 00:17:49.654
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

00:17:49.757 --> 00:17:53.791
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

00:17:54.587 --> 00:17:58.892
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

00:17:59.171 --> 00:18:02.023
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:07.282
[you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:11.571
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

00:18:11.818 --> 00:18:13.963
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

00:18:14.269 --> 00:18:16.388
they have no love or respect for each other

00:18:16.698 --> 00:18:19.462
but they have an awe or fear.

00:18:21.219 --> 00:18:23.316
And they are afraid of such a woman.

00:18:23.763 --> 00:18:28.469
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
the husbands are better controlled.

00:18:30.472 --> 00:18:33.889
But their basic principle they lose.

00:18:34.702 --> 00:18:37.376
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

00:18:39.888 --> 00:18:42.271
and they land up in difficulties.

00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:47.142
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

00:18:47.269 --> 00:18:49.715
is to respect her chastity,

00:18:52.078 --> 00:18:56.119
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

00:18:58.235 --> 00:18:59.863
That is the steadiness of her.

00:19:00.043 --> 00:19:02.998
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

00:19:03.795 --> 00:19:08.449
If the wife is docile or obedient,

00:19:08.657 --> 00:19:14.426
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
Alright!

00:19:16.375 --> 00:19:20.375
But this woman, the housewife,

00:19:21.157 --> 00:19:25.174
has to know that she is not docile.

00:19:26.122 --> 00:19:30.783
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

00:19:31.794 --> 00:19:36.814
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

00:19:38.103 --> 00:19:41.129
If the husband is stupid, alright,

00:19:41.346 --> 00:19:43.790
he's stupid like a child, finished!

00:19:44.441 --> 00:19:47.453
But the husband has to know that he must

00:19:47.737 --> 00:19:50.709
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

00:19:51.786 --> 00:19:53.790
he's good for nothing.

00:19:56.101 --> 00:19:58.568
First thing is that he must see

00:19:58.799 --> 00:20:03.476
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

00:20:04.386 --> 00:20:06.219
Then the blessings flow.

00:20:06.438 --> 00:20:12.017
But in no way he should insult her

00:20:12.473 --> 00:20:15.447
or be unkind to her

00:20:15.674 --> 00:20:18.925
and raise his voice or say things to her.

00:20:19.052 --> 00:20:24.515
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

00:20:25.543 --> 00:20:28.027
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

00:20:28.150 --> 00:20:31.646
give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

00:20:32.263 --> 00:20:35.147
She has not to be dominating,

00:20:35.364 --> 00:20:39.411
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

00:20:40.108 --> 00:20:42.536
She is the source of peace,

00:20:44.388 --> 00:20:46.835
she is the source of joy

00:20:47.225 --> 00:20:49.655
and she is the peacemaker.

00:20:50.230 --> 00:20:53.316
If she is the one who creates problems,

00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:57.661
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

00:20:59.786 --> 00:21:03.296
So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

00:21:04.664 --> 00:21:08.229
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:13.727
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

00:21:13.957 --> 00:21:17.833
your left Nabhi can never improve.

00:21:20.714 --> 00:21:25.532
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

00:21:26.450 --> 00:21:29.584
Now in the west the problem with women

00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.025
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

00:21:38.199 --> 00:21:42.416
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

00:21:43.416 --> 00:21:48.016
They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

00:21:48.302 --> 00:21:50.894
They are the queen of the house

00:21:51.648 --> 00:21:54.802
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

00:21:55.088 --> 00:21:57.088
young frivolous girl.

00:21:58.174 --> 00:22:01.880
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

00:22:02.349 --> 00:22:06.108
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

00:22:07.109 --> 00:22:11.082
that, does not behove a housewife.

00:22:11.257 --> 00:22:13.926
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

00:22:14.426 --> 00:22:18.128
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

00:22:18.296 --> 00:22:20.306
and when they have to fight.

00:22:21.626 --> 00:22:24.827
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

00:22:24.978 --> 00:22:29.060
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
that's the limit!

00:22:32.799 --> 00:22:36.362
They start always comparing themselves

00:22:36.902 --> 00:22:38.986
with the husband, to begin with.

00:22:39.407 --> 00:22:43.758
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:47.443
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

00:22:47.613 --> 00:22:49.988
low family he has no money,

00:22:50.171 --> 00:22:52.633
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

00:22:53.118 --> 00:22:55.614
Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

00:22:56.321 --> 00:22:59.672
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

00:23:01.876 --> 00:23:06.767
Also in her own ways

00:23:07.299 --> 00:23:08.881
she will feel guilty,

00:23:09.509 --> 00:23:13.138
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

00:23:13.393 --> 00:23:17.284
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

00:23:18.688 --> 00:23:25.008
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

00:23:26.579 --> 00:23:29.686
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

00:23:30.013 --> 00:23:34.012
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

00:23:34.155 --> 00:23:37.528
by your strength, by everything

00:23:39.898 --> 00:23:43.988
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

00:23:45.692 --> 00:23:50.503
by dominating others, by strangling others,

00:23:51.130 --> 00:23:55.095
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

00:23:58.548 --> 00:24:00.960
frog in the well.

00:24:02.071 --> 00:24:05.943
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

00:24:06.007 --> 00:24:07.650
Lets have our house separately,

00:24:07.761 --> 00:24:10.843
nobody should come in the house'.
Even a rat won't enter that house.

00:24:12.976 --> 00:24:17.975
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

00:24:19.827 --> 00:24:23.681
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:24.475 --> 00:24:27.241
is the negative form of understanding.

00:24:27.852 --> 00:24:31.602
These are absolutely absurd things,

00:24:31.714 --> 00:24:36.294
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

00:24:38.456 --> 00:24:40.759
All this kind of selfishness,

00:24:41.045 --> 00:24:45.817
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:48.401 --> 00:24:51.173
But a thing of a housewife is,

00:24:51.316 --> 00:24:54.802
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

00:24:55.274 --> 00:24:58.847
For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.468
So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

00:25:01.595 --> 00:25:03.928
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

00:25:04.408 --> 00:25:06.928
'But may be they would like to eat more.'

00:25:07.516 --> 00:25:09.765
'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

00:25:10.368 --> 00:25:12.751
'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

00:25:13.307 --> 00:25:16.804
So she thinks of her generosity.

00:25:17.098 --> 00:25:18.782
She enjoys her generosity.

00:25:19.449 --> 00:25:20.933
I have known many like that.

00:25:21.068 --> 00:25:23.972
Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

00:25:26.215 --> 00:25:28.516
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

00:25:28.596 --> 00:25:30.492
will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

00:25:30.603 --> 00:25:32.770
you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:35.687
No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

00:25:35.823 --> 00:25:37.866
Then she just start thinking immediately.

00:25:38.018 --> 00:25:40.925
'What vegetables are available in the market?

00:25:41.227 --> 00:25:43.332
What should I get? What is the best?'

00:25:43.491 --> 00:25:48.339
I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

00:25:48.536 --> 00:25:50.760
I am just a relation,

00:25:51.603 --> 00:25:54.740
but they want to express their love through the food,

00:25:54.879 --> 00:25:59.792
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

00:26:01.425 --> 00:26:03.710
and this is one of  the quality,

00:26:03.801 --> 00:26:06.210
the generosity for woman doesn't have

00:26:06.562 --> 00:26:09.810
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

00:26:11.583 --> 00:26:15.071
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

00:26:17.576 --> 00:26:19.919
but wife has to be very generous

00:26:20.062 --> 00:26:22.728
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

00:26:23.932 --> 00:26:27.210
not to her own children but to others.

00:26:29.199 --> 00:26:33.535
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:34.791 --> 00:26:37.524
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

00:26:38.706 --> 00:26:42.416
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

00:26:44.882 --> 00:26:48.121
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

00:26:48.781 --> 00:26:53.468
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

00:26:56.817 --> 00:27:00.198
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

00:27:00.643 --> 00:27:04.940
but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

00:27:05.223 --> 00:27:10.455
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

00:27:11.733 --> 00:27:13.976
about your own understanding.

00:27:14.175 --> 00:27:16.715
You are not aware of yourself.

00:27:18.078 --> 00:27:22.474
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

00:27:22.979 --> 00:27:26.820
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

00:27:30.042 --> 00:27:32.494
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

00:27:32.637 --> 00:27:34.359
Alright, leave it for a while.

00:27:34.536 --> 00:27:36.723
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

00:27:36.811 --> 00:27:39.644
'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:44.413
The women must understand the men.

00:27:44.937 --> 00:27:48.478
They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

00:27:49.809 --> 00:27:52.277
They see everything in a big way, you see.

00:27:52.861 --> 00:27:56.804
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

00:27:58.035 --> 00:27:59.750
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

00:27:59.869 --> 00:28:01.710
They are too above these things.

00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:05.997
They are above these things. You must understand that!

00:28:07.598 --> 00:28:11.876
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

00:28:12.610 --> 00:28:15.459
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

00:28:16.023 --> 00:28:19.614
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

00:28:21.588 --> 00:28:23.667
It is coming to that point.

00:28:24.048 --> 00:28:26.822
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

00:28:26.957 --> 00:28:29.967
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

00:28:30.071 --> 00:28:32.644
without any moustaches.

00:28:37.715 --> 00:28:40.470
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

00:28:40.844 --> 00:28:43.386
But there is no subordination of any kind.

00:28:43.474 --> 00:28:45.832
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

00:28:46.016 --> 00:28:49.271
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

00:28:49.663 --> 00:28:52.173
and, above all, to your righteousness

00:28:53.165 --> 00:28:56.621
because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

00:28:58.476 --> 00:29:00.690
has to look after that side.

00:29:02.214 --> 00:29:03.916
How many quarrels you create?

00:29:04.068 --> 00:29:08.508
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

00:29:08.722 --> 00:29:11.327
Supposing we send two peacemakers

00:29:11.653 --> 00:29:15.261
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

00:29:16.454 --> 00:29:18.716
what will you say to such a thing?

00:29:20.427 --> 00:29:23.706
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

00:29:24.913 --> 00:29:29.227
you have  the one who has to bring such

00:29:30.613 --> 00:29:34.567
expression of love, such sweet things

00:29:37.636 --> 00:29:43.584
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

00:29:44.119 --> 00:29:46.102
because you are the mother.

00:29:46.534 --> 00:29:49.232
The family must feel secured within you

00:29:50.171 --> 00:29:53.475
and this love is your power.

00:29:55.927 --> 00:29:58.577
This is your power that you can give love

00:29:59.008 --> 00:30:03.455
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

00:30:04.873 --> 00:30:08.365
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

00:30:08.468 --> 00:30:10.865
I don't know I'll have to build another house!

00:30:11.066 --> 00:30:13.303
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

00:30:13.406 --> 00:30:15.192
I will not take any individual presents."

00:30:15.224 --> 00:30:17.900
Now still despite that. I don't know,

00:30:18.107 --> 00:30:23.783
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

00:30:25.002 --> 00:30:29.202
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

00:30:29.313 --> 00:30:31.426
You are some times surprised.

00:30:33.687 --> 00:30:37.409
I'll give you one simple example of my own life

00:30:37.544 --> 00:30:41.119
which will tell you how love can work it out.

00:30:41.738 --> 00:30:45.059
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

00:30:45.675 --> 00:30:48.016
And once I was in Delhi,

00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:53.155
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

00:30:53.270 --> 00:30:54.723
sitting outside in the lawn,

00:30:55.096 --> 00:30:58.830
when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

00:30:59.188 --> 00:31:01.500
and they came and said, "See now we are...

00:31:01.738 --> 00:31:05.121
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:07.911
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

00:31:08.078 --> 00:31:09.310
and he is a Muslim,

00:31:09.485 --> 00:31:12.716
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

00:31:13.264 --> 00:31:15.517
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

00:31:15.613 --> 00:31:16.827
they were quite alright.

00:31:17.284 --> 00:31:20.422
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:22.863
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

00:31:22.967 --> 00:31:25.048
and a bathroom and this thing,

00:31:25.215 --> 00:31:27.695
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

00:31:27.828 --> 00:31:30.084
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

00:31:31.537 --> 00:31:33.462
In the evening my brother came in.

00:31:33.614 --> 00:31:35.462
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

00:31:35.598 --> 00:31:36.631
he said "What is this?

00:31:36.719 --> 00:31:38.917
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

00:31:39.139 --> 00:31:43.159
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

00:31:43.397 --> 00:31:45.047
my husband came, he also joined him

00:31:45.151 --> 00:31:48.420
because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

00:31:49.322 --> 00:31:51.440
All men just the same, you see,

00:31:51.743 --> 00:31:53.674
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

00:31:53.761 --> 00:31:55.707
she has kept these three persons here.

00:31:55.874 --> 00:31:58.812
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

00:31:58.924 --> 00:32:01.316
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

00:32:01.452 --> 00:32:04.644
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

00:32:04.771 --> 00:32:06.273
all kind of things.

00:32:07.977 --> 00:32:09.857
Next morning they forgot about that.

00:32:10.620 --> 00:32:13.296
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

00:32:13.836 --> 00:32:15.783
I can't drag them out today, one night."

00:32:15.942 --> 00:32:18.382
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

00:32:18.723 --> 00:32:19.804
That's like men!

00:32:19.900 --> 00:32:21.868
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

00:32:21.987 --> 00:32:25.364
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

00:32:25.690 --> 00:32:28.524
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

00:32:29.168 --> 00:32:31.553
Next morning they went away for their work.

00:32:31.656 --> 00:32:34.251
They had no time. It was, you see,

00:32:34.363 --> 00:32:37.880
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

00:32:38.095 --> 00:32:41.224
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

00:32:42.364 --> 00:32:45.775
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

00:32:46.144 --> 00:32:49.321
Then this lady got a job

00:32:50.361 --> 00:32:55.859
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

00:32:56.145 --> 00:33:00.694
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

00:33:01.123 --> 00:33:07.915
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

00:33:08.376 --> 00:33:10.181
It had a reflection in Delhi

00:33:10.261 --> 00:33:12.594
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

00:33:13.027 --> 00:33:16.948
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

00:33:17.083 --> 00:33:20.738
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

00:33:21.066 --> 00:33:22.883
I said, "No. How can I have?"

00:33:23.360 --> 00:33:25.538
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

00:33:25.809 --> 00:33:28.723
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

00:33:29.025 --> 00:33:31.235
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

00:33:32.291 --> 00:33:35.619
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

00:33:39.364 --> 00:33:42.143
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

00:33:42.262 --> 00:33:44.699
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

00:33:44.818 --> 00:33:46.365
because I will not allow you!"

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:48.627
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

00:33:48.833 --> 00:33:53.614
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

00:33:53.752 --> 00:33:55.659
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

00:33:55.755 --> 00:33:58.326
I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

00:33:58.778 --> 00:34:00.098
His life was saved.

00:34:00.603 --> 00:34:03.071
Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

00:34:03.213 --> 00:34:06.206
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

00:34:08.065 --> 00:34:10.689
and this lady became a great actress,

00:34:11.460 --> 00:34:13.034
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

00:34:13.201 --> 00:34:15.716
the one who used to act like a mother?

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:20.367
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

00:34:21.693 --> 00:34:24.324
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

00:34:24.452 --> 00:34:26.292
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

00:34:26.499 --> 00:34:29.661
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

00:34:29.868 --> 00:34:31.633
they will just go mad about Me,"

00:34:31.712 --> 00:34:33.926
and I said "I have no time for all that."

00:34:34.268 --> 00:34:39.075
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

00:34:39.158 --> 00:34:40.380
to give them some good films.

00:34:40.467 --> 00:34:43.159
But it all made into a farce, later on.

00:34:43.388 --> 00:34:45.533
They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

00:34:45.867 --> 00:34:50.305
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

00:34:50.623 --> 00:34:52.303
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

00:34:52.383 --> 00:34:54.525
I have said, I have anything to do with it."

00:34:55.805 --> 00:35:00.904
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

00:35:02.965 --> 00:35:05.673
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

00:35:05.761 --> 00:35:08.461
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

00:35:08.589 --> 00:35:11.352
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

00:35:11.488 --> 00:35:12.846
You will have to give me Sari.

00:35:12.934 --> 00:35:14.688
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

00:35:14.765 --> 00:35:16.696
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

00:35:16.815 --> 00:35:18.539
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

00:35:18.651 --> 00:35:21.436
big muhurat is the one where you start it.

00:35:22.109 --> 00:35:25.532
So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.791
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

00:35:27.911 --> 00:35:29.579
that she has seen Me after twelve years.

00:35:29.691 --> 00:35:31.805
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

00:35:32.041 --> 00:35:34.940
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

00:35:35.599 --> 00:35:37.546
fell into my arms

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:41.511
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

00:35:41.662 --> 00:35:43.664
I have been trying to trace you out."

00:35:43.928 --> 00:35:47.121
Then she started describing Me and all.

00:35:47.264 --> 00:35:50.052
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

00:35:50.311 --> 00:35:53.308
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

00:35:53.629 --> 00:35:56.599
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:58.400
we'll give our lives for Her!"

00:35:58.742 --> 00:36:01.024
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

00:36:01.136 --> 00:36:03.765
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

00:36:03.979 --> 00:36:05.046
Nothing doing. "

00:36:05.275 --> 00:36:06.275
See now,

00:36:06.683 --> 00:36:09.914
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

00:36:10.224 --> 00:36:13.870
I didn't have so many rights on

00:36:14.692 --> 00:36:17.654
my husband's property, or anything,

00:36:17.758 --> 00:36:19.918
and my brother another dominating fellow,

00:36:20.148 --> 00:36:22.777
both of them put together,

00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.414
just were about to kill me that night,

00:36:26.232 --> 00:36:29.268
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.360
and then you know when I told my husband

00:36:32.480 --> 00:36:34.599
and my brother, they were amazed.

00:36:34.758 --> 00:36:37.268
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

00:36:37.706 --> 00:36:39.214
and see the change,

00:36:39.643 --> 00:36:41.980
how much they have...",

00:36:42.592 --> 00:36:45.262
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:47.200
no to any charitable institution.

00:36:47.311 --> 00:36:49.233
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:54.420
And the whole idea of a...

00:36:55.042 --> 00:36:59.520
earning and money just toppled down.

00:36:59.793 --> 00:37:03.038
And she has acted in many films for charity

00:37:03.753 --> 00:37:08.378
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

00:37:11.304 --> 00:37:15.933
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

00:37:17.034 --> 00:37:19.248
because she herself is charitable.

00:37:20.026 --> 00:37:22.663
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

00:37:23.946 --> 00:37:26.231
And she can create beauty around her,

00:37:26.552 --> 00:37:30.474
in her household, in her family, in her society.

00:37:30.633 --> 00:37:32.477
Everywhere. But no!

00:37:32.646 --> 00:37:36.098
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

00:37:36.577 --> 00:37:41.382
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

00:37:43.683 --> 00:37:45.255
[UNCLEAR]

00:37:45.422 --> 00:37:49.406
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

00:37:52.795 --> 00:37:56.533
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

00:37:56.644 --> 00:37:59.727
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

00:37:59.982 --> 00:38:02.373
and that they have to be told.

00:38:03.067 --> 00:38:04.876
But this is not the way!

00:38:05.387 --> 00:38:10.894
There is another way of improving these men, who try to

00:38:12.459 --> 00:38:13.711
destroy the women,

00:38:13.981 --> 00:38:18.920
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

00:38:21.419 --> 00:38:23.981
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

00:38:24.306 --> 00:38:27.223
He will never side with men if they are chaste

00:38:27.596 --> 00:38:30.457
and do not try to show off their body

00:38:30.648 --> 00:38:33.290
and show off their beauty and want to make,

00:38:33.522 --> 00:38:35.827
sort of, a capital out of it.

00:38:38.879 --> 00:38:42.635
Such women are extremely powerful,

00:38:44.123 --> 00:38:46.657
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

00:38:46.935 --> 00:38:48.461
when it comes to anything

00:38:48.612 --> 00:38:52.122
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

00:38:52.599 --> 00:38:54.021
She fought the British.

00:38:54.228 --> 00:38:55.968
And the British also

00:38:56.389 --> 00:38:58.645
were surprised at her valour and they said that

00:38:58.772 --> 00:39:00.369
we had got Jhansi, alright,

00:39:00.822 --> 00:39:03.658
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.188
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

00:39:09.419 --> 00:39:12.905
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

00:39:13.034 --> 00:39:16.487
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

00:39:17.587 --> 00:39:20.407
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

00:39:20.614 --> 00:39:24.004
who have been great women, who were housewives.

00:39:27.383 --> 00:39:34.149
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

00:39:34.380 --> 00:39:35.940
or potential of any energy.

00:39:36.091 --> 00:39:38.988
Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

00:39:39.115 --> 00:39:41.443
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

00:39:41.721 --> 00:39:44.922
one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

00:39:46.123 --> 00:39:48.159
So one has to understand that we are potential

00:39:48.334 --> 00:39:52.304
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

00:39:52.553 --> 00:39:55.370
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

00:39:55.617 --> 00:39:59.201
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

00:39:59.614 --> 00:40:01.608
But men are another stupid stuff

00:40:01.974 --> 00:40:04.699
because they will not respect a woman

00:40:04.897 --> 00:40:07.471
who loves them, who is chaste,

00:40:07.665 --> 00:40:10.839
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

00:40:10.993 --> 00:40:13.994
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

00:40:14.161 --> 00:40:17.616
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

00:40:17.768 --> 00:40:21.056
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

00:40:21.239 --> 00:40:25.268
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

00:40:25.715 --> 00:40:29.479
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

00:40:32.016 --> 00:40:37.280
What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

00:40:38.201 --> 00:40:40.481
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

00:40:40.763 --> 00:40:42.215
that the way they get attracted.

00:40:42.747 --> 00:40:45.608
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

00:40:45.870 --> 00:40:48.022
women become very insecure

00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:51.010
and they get insecured. As a result,

00:40:51.217 --> 00:40:53.807
the men suffer and women suffer.

00:40:55.175 --> 00:40:58.453
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

00:40:58.813 --> 00:41:03.902
will consequently get blood cancer.

00:41:11.923 --> 00:41:14.121
And the woman who behaves like this,

00:41:16.636 --> 00:41:21.026
in this manner and if she ill-treats

00:41:21.376 --> 00:41:24.791
her husband, will get asthma

00:41:25.397 --> 00:41:30.798
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

00:41:33.327 --> 00:41:36.771
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

00:41:38.365 --> 00:41:41.389
could be complete dehydration of the body.

00:41:46.619 --> 00:41:49.262
Because left nabhi is so important.

00:41:50.405 --> 00:41:53.698
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

00:41:53.881 --> 00:41:58.565
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

00:41:59.281 --> 00:42:03.307
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

00:42:03.771 --> 00:42:05.298
I have always seen

00:42:05.552 --> 00:42:09.845
that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

00:42:11.946 --> 00:42:14.504
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

00:42:14.615 --> 00:42:17.006
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

00:42:17.070 --> 00:42:19.627
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

00:42:19.815 --> 00:42:22.153
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

00:42:22.733 --> 00:42:26.348
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

00:42:27.566 --> 00:42:30.742
He gets something for the jumping

00:42:30.984 --> 00:42:34.674
and she gets something for her torturing.

00:42:35.211 --> 00:42:39.663
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

00:42:43.368 --> 00:42:45.704
This so-called figure madness,

00:42:46.167 --> 00:42:49.476
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:54.806
It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

00:42:57.956 --> 00:43:00.574
Women have to be settled down women.

00:43:01.818 --> 00:43:03.818
They have to be Grahasthis,

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:06.541
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

00:43:06.806 --> 00:43:09.179
Said to be satisfied with her household.

00:43:09.698 --> 00:43:11.612
If she is all the time running about,

00:43:11.715 --> 00:43:13.296
she doesn't want to stay in the house

00:43:13.424 --> 00:43:17.609
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

00:43:20.038 --> 00:43:24.816
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

00:43:25.046 --> 00:43:27.231
and then she was made a housewife

00:43:27.581 --> 00:43:29.647
but she could not stop her running about

00:43:29.838 --> 00:43:31.743
because she was a maid servant.

00:43:33.621 --> 00:43:35.536
She doesn't settle in the household.

00:43:35.814 --> 00:43:39.713
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

00:43:39.861 --> 00:43:43.185
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

00:43:43.508 --> 00:43:45.603
but for others to welcome.

00:43:46.302 --> 00:43:49.321
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

00:43:49.432 --> 00:43:51.765
to come and sit and enjoy.

00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.325
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:55.436 --> 00:43:58.232
we find that people, after marriage,

00:43:58.368 --> 00:44:02.633
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:04.123 --> 00:44:07.775
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

00:44:08.069 --> 00:44:11.293
and disobedient, torturesome.

00:44:12.249 --> 00:44:16.509
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

00:44:18.097 --> 00:44:19.617
Not that I punish this,

00:44:19.781 --> 00:44:22.161
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

00:44:22.270 --> 00:44:25.212
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

00:44:25.451 --> 00:44:28.466
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

00:44:31.450 --> 00:44:34.026
Then children become funny.

00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:38.136
Just for your family, just for your food,

00:44:38.245 --> 00:44:41.764
just for your household, this selfishness,

00:44:43.004 --> 00:44:46.170
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

00:44:46.387 --> 00:44:49.314
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

00:44:49.783 --> 00:44:52.286
but if the man is a gone case,

00:44:55.938 --> 00:44:58.288
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

00:44:58.433 --> 00:45:01.779
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:07.801
Our family is not of one man one woman

00:45:08.161 --> 00:45:10.657
but the whole universe is our family.

00:45:13.037 --> 00:45:15.409
We are not on our own,

00:45:16.058 --> 00:45:19.535
and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

00:45:20.284 --> 00:45:23.046
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

00:45:23.444 --> 00:45:26.090
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

00:45:26.457 --> 00:45:27.892
a day will come,

00:45:28.094 --> 00:45:32.623
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

00:45:33.453 --> 00:45:38.465
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

00:45:38.573 --> 00:45:41.487
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

00:45:44.370 --> 00:45:48.640
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:48.834 --> 00:45:52.621
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

00:45:52.738 --> 00:45:53.964
group of women,

00:45:54.189 --> 00:45:58.272
she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

00:46:05.086 --> 00:46:07.849
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

00:46:07.986 --> 00:46:11.613
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

00:46:11.823 --> 00:46:15.386
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

00:46:19.307 --> 00:46:22.611
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

00:46:22.763 --> 00:46:26.051
Not because it is a punishment from God.

00:46:29.707 --> 00:46:33.206
So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

00:46:34.908 --> 00:46:39.753
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:39.919 --> 00:46:43.857
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

00:46:48.096 --> 00:46:51.746
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

00:46:54.139 --> 00:46:57.126
Those women who have tried such tricks,

00:46:58.012 --> 00:47:01.114
should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

00:47:01.230 --> 00:47:03.306
Nobody respects such a woman.

00:47:04.834 --> 00:47:08.022
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

00:47:09.342 --> 00:47:11.620
The leader's wife or the leadership

00:47:11.736 --> 00:47:19.294
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

00:47:20.016 --> 00:47:22.006
Most insignificant.

00:47:24.298 --> 00:47:28.280
What you got is much higher than this.

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:35.196
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

00:47:35.807 --> 00:47:38.296
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

00:47:44.469 --> 00:47:46.207
Is the minimal of minimal.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.234
Is the lowest of lowest.

00:47:48.551 --> 00:47:52.388
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

00:47:53.887 --> 00:47:56.448
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

00:47:58.690 --> 00:48:01.727
But that service itself is enjoyment.

00:48:02.916 --> 00:48:04.870
But if you just keep to service.

00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:09.184
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

00:48:10.228 --> 00:48:15.710
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.515
You can be used for a cross!

00:48:23.682 --> 00:48:26.002
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

00:48:26.137 --> 00:48:29.849
unless and until you have that essence

00:48:29.976 --> 00:48:33.377
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

00:48:35.317 --> 00:48:40.332
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

00:48:41.530 --> 00:48:45.498
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

00:48:45.991 --> 00:48:47.787
then what is left?

00:48:48.867 --> 00:48:51.989
In the same way, all the so-called service

00:48:52.092 --> 00:48:54.467
and seva and tapasya

00:48:54.690 --> 00:48:57.954
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

00:48:59.974 --> 00:49:03.024
So the essence of all this is sweetness

00:49:04.594 --> 00:49:07.157
and that is generated by women.

00:49:09.196 --> 00:49:11.553
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

00:49:11.704 --> 00:49:13.649
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

00:49:13.817 --> 00:49:17.200
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

00:49:22.733 --> 00:49:26.153
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

00:49:27.207 --> 00:49:29.350
It's a good thing in a way.

00:49:30.557 --> 00:49:34.647
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

00:49:39.068 --> 00:49:41.276
But to make him all the time slave,

00:49:41.395 --> 00:49:44.204
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

00:49:44.367 --> 00:49:46.588
Is not the job of a housewife!

00:49:50.604 --> 00:49:55.831
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:58.434
She gives you everything.

00:49:58.530 --> 00:50:01.640
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

00:50:02.218 --> 00:50:03.736
Such powers She has.

00:50:03.895 --> 00:50:06.816
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

00:50:07.311 --> 00:50:10.979
You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

00:50:11.075 --> 00:50:14.800
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

00:50:15.026 --> 00:50:19.448
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

00:50:19.571 --> 00:50:22.158
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

00:50:22.365 --> 00:50:23.955
Least expected!

00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:27.824
Never in life-time.

00:50:29.102 --> 00:50:31.113
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

00:50:31.319 --> 00:50:33.406
First time, I said something and see the effect.

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:36.033
Because I've never said him!

00:50:38.818 --> 00:50:42.119
So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

00:50:42.302 --> 00:50:44.812
satisfied in her self because she has to give.

00:50:44.911 --> 00:50:47.792
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

00:50:47.994 --> 00:50:50.699
She has to give love because she is love.

00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.719
She has to give all the services.

00:50:53.839 --> 00:50:55.761
She has to give all the possessions,

00:50:55.904 --> 00:50:59.216
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

00:50:59.336 --> 00:51:01.291
what a responsibility!

00:51:02.172 --> 00:51:05.389
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

00:51:05.559 --> 00:51:07.289
is the responsibility of a woman,

00:51:07.424 --> 00:51:10.617
and she should feel proud of it,
that such a responsibility has come to me.

00:51:11.348 --> 00:51:12.720
A housewife

00:51:12.872 --> 00:51:16.387
has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

00:51:17.384 --> 00:51:21.616
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

00:51:23.303 --> 00:51:25.342
because they think they have become leaders.

00:51:25.493 --> 00:51:27.059
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

00:51:27.178 --> 00:51:30.768
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

00:51:32.899 --> 00:51:36.791
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:41.351
I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

00:51:45.285 --> 00:51:48.756
and each one of them adores Me.

00:51:49.288 --> 00:51:51.704
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

00:51:51.855 --> 00:51:54.135
all of them will come from all over to see  me

00:51:54.215 --> 00:51:57.336
but my husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

00:51:58.238 --> 00:52:02.431
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
and they come and see me, not him!

00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:07.152
If I had not given them love,

00:52:07.287 --> 00:52:09.703
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

00:52:10.136 --> 00:52:12.017
they would have not come to Me.

00:52:13.490 --> 00:52:17.594
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

00:52:17.892 --> 00:52:20.796
They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

00:52:22.784 --> 00:52:26.230
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

00:52:26.365 --> 00:52:27.995
many stupid women.

00:52:28.448 --> 00:52:31.846
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

00:52:34.011 --> 00:52:36.979
Because they don't know what power they have got.

00:52:40.463 --> 00:52:43.669
They don't know what responsibility they have.

00:52:45.403 --> 00:52:47.673
I'm an example before them.

00:52:51.954 --> 00:52:55.572
And this is the very big problem with me that practically

00:52:55.866 --> 00:52:59.058
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:01.681
I must say, horrible.

00:53:04.195 --> 00:53:06.750
And Sahaja Yoga goes 'dhup' like that with them.

00:53:07.778 --> 00:53:09.698
They can't live in an ashram,

00:53:09.833 --> 00:53:12.956
they will have their food,
the husband must see that they have their food.

00:53:13.075 --> 00:53:15.903
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

00:53:16.086 --> 00:53:19.675
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

00:53:23.279 --> 00:53:26.739
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

00:53:26.890 --> 00:53:29.812
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:33.987
But No, they sit down,

00:53:34.123 --> 00:53:36.924
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

00:53:37.607 --> 00:53:40.308
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

00:53:40.443 --> 00:53:42.303
Just do that! Do this!"

00:53:46.731 --> 00:53:49.079
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

00:53:50.108 --> 00:53:53.861
Every wife of a leader

00:53:54.110 --> 00:53:59.006
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

00:54:03.775 --> 00:54:06.568
They have to cook. And with heart.

00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:11.134
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

00:54:11.764 --> 00:54:14.164
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

00:54:16.690 --> 00:54:19.594
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

00:54:19.869 --> 00:54:22.887
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

00:54:23.197 --> 00:54:26.271
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

00:54:26.401 --> 00:54:28.599
encourage their niceness.

00:54:28.901 --> 00:54:31.357
Also I have seen, some very good ladies

00:54:31.429 --> 00:54:34.311
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:34.415 --> 00:54:35.672
After marriage they are lost.

00:54:35.736 --> 00:54:38.941
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

00:54:41.139 --> 00:54:44.964
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
otherwise they are not there.

00:54:45.943 --> 00:54:49.787
Today I was asking Arnaud,
he told me so many of them are like that here.

00:54:50.695 --> 00:54:53.515
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

00:54:54.923 --> 00:54:57.240
because before marriage they were better off.

00:54:58.795 --> 00:55:03.397
So how much it is important, a Gruhakshmi Principle with in us,

00:55:03.810 --> 00:55:05.696
for us to be together,

00:55:05.959 --> 00:55:09.149
to us to grow together. To feel the togetherness,

00:55:09.398 --> 00:55:11.897
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

00:55:12.570 --> 00:55:16.038
So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

00:55:16.197 --> 00:55:17.855
the Ragas we have.

00:55:18.086 --> 00:55:19.900
Ra is energy.

00:55:20.734 --> 00:55:24.540
Ga is in Sanskrit language 'Ga, Gayathi'  means 'which penetrates',

00:55:24.699 --> 00:55:26.040
'which moves into everything',

00:55:27.223 --> 00:55:30.265
it's the ethereal, etheric qualities.

00:55:31.152 --> 00:55:33.096
etheric...... into which you see

00:55:33.263 --> 00:55:36.136
You put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

00:55:36.946 --> 00:55:41.393
So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

00:55:42.922 --> 00:55:45.358
and touches your spirit.

00:55:47.250 --> 00:55:48.694
That is the Raga.

00:55:49.324 --> 00:55:54.796
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

00:55:59.845 --> 00:56:03.900
Supposing if you stand with a military band

00:56:04.367 --> 00:56:07.580
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

00:56:09.418 --> 00:56:13.515
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

00:56:13.725 --> 00:56:18.575
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

00:56:20.247 --> 00:56:23.429
The way the housewife decorates the house.

00:56:23.885 --> 00:56:28.021
She smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

00:56:28.232 --> 00:56:30.177
Then she's looking after everyone.

00:56:30.257 --> 00:56:32.376
Everybody knows she is standing there.

00:56:32.544 --> 00:56:36.658
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

00:56:36.921 --> 00:56:40.479
some people for birthday cake of your child

00:56:40.733 --> 00:56:42.808
and you cut the cake first

00:56:43.753 --> 00:56:45.700
because you are the housewife.

00:56:46.566 --> 00:56:50.164
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:54.376
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

00:56:54.646 --> 00:56:57.919
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:01.935
Look after all of them,

00:57:03.364 --> 00:57:07.814
and this is what is a Raga is.

00:57:07.876 --> 00:57:12.485
It caters to all your angularities.

00:57:12.589 --> 00:57:15.710
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

00:57:15.798 --> 00:57:18.467
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

00:57:19.257 --> 00:57:20.883
It soothes you down.

00:57:22.642 --> 00:57:24.856
It makes you settle down.

00:57:25.602 --> 00:57:30.798
Like people come home for five days, live like

00:57:31.381 --> 00:57:33.721
I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

00:57:33.986 --> 00:57:36.932
and live in a tent-like thing

00:57:37.083 --> 00:57:40.181
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

00:57:40.946 --> 00:57:42.819
or they go and stay in a hotel.

00:57:43.224 --> 00:57:45.465
Nobody wants to stay in the house

00:57:46.037 --> 00:57:49.262
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

00:57:52.027 --> 00:57:55.619
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

00:57:55.814 --> 00:57:58.931
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

00:57:59.046 --> 00:58:02.720
Imagine somebody listening to a raga when he's a jumpy.

00:58:05.010 --> 00:58:06.734
So, one has to settle down

00:58:07.139 --> 00:58:12.557
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

00:58:12.836 --> 00:58:14.457
who is a housewife,

00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:18.325
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

00:58:18.923 --> 00:58:22.702
As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

00:58:22.824 --> 00:58:24.784
in the modern times, much more,

00:58:25.227 --> 00:58:29.772
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

00:58:30.165 --> 00:58:32.156
Is that the wife...

00:58:32.906 --> 00:58:35.995
normally in India before, you see,

00:58:36.075 --> 00:58:38.363
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

00:58:38.593 --> 00:58:40.715
all the time his wife is not with him.

00:58:40.977 --> 00:58:43.852
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

00:58:44.152 --> 00:58:48.130
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

00:58:48.845 --> 00:58:51.379
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

00:58:51.707 --> 00:58:53.389
then they have a divorce.

00:58:54.139 --> 00:58:57.007
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

00:58:57.165 --> 00:58:59.467
household, Sahaja Yoga, things like that.

00:58:59.962 --> 00:59:03.535
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

00:59:04.204 --> 00:59:06.524
sits on the ground, in India.

00:59:06.715 --> 00:59:09.257
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:12.282
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

00:59:12.420 --> 00:59:16.747
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

00:59:18.165 --> 00:59:20.117
Or  "This lady was quarrelling

00:59:20.237 --> 00:59:22.905
or I met another lady she was telling me you were this

00:59:23.019 --> 00:59:26.209
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

00:59:27.175 --> 00:59:28.515
That's why in India

00:59:28.635 --> 00:59:30.722
if husband has to show his temper he doesn't eat

00:59:30.825 --> 00:59:33.876
his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

00:59:38.085 --> 00:59:39.913
That is how, they show their temper.

00:59:40.167 --> 00:59:43.119
So then she fans the husband slowly

00:59:43.321 --> 00:59:46.973
and tells him good things, you see, today you know why?

00:59:47.222 --> 00:59:51.263
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

00:59:51.965 --> 00:59:54.823
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes. He said, he said so".

00:59:55.088 --> 00:59:58.366
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

01:00:02.158 --> 01:00:04.279
but you see all nice things, you see,

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:07.544
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

01:00:07.706 --> 01:00:09.775
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

01:00:09.904 --> 01:00:11.507
And your sister is coming.

01:00:11.635 --> 01:00:13.611
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

01:00:13.771 --> 01:00:15.787
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:20.255
So he eats his food nicely then he goes washes his hands

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:23.280
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

01:00:23.465 --> 01:00:25.601
where there is a jam, always.

01:00:26.287 --> 01:00:31.400
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

01:00:31.841 --> 01:00:35.088
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

01:00:35.319 --> 01:00:37.591
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:40.228
that on the periphery of the

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:43.630
wheel you have the speed

01:00:43.865 --> 01:00:48.548
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be at the axis,

01:00:49.296 --> 01:00:53.671
and so the husband and the wife,
the left and the right side of a chariot

01:00:54.055 --> 01:00:56.175
have to be on the axis

01:00:56.398 --> 01:00:59.233
and the left is left and the right is right.

01:00:59.775 --> 01:01:02.428
Now the women always take more time to get ready.

01:01:02.579 --> 01:01:04.914
Not me, I take less than My husband,

01:01:05.535 --> 01:01:09.846
much less than my husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

01:01:10.389 --> 01:01:13.954
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

01:01:14.099 --> 01:01:17.402
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

01:01:17.609 --> 01:01:19.785
Men must see their watches ten times.

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:24.790
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

01:01:25.013 --> 01:01:26.612
if they are real women.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.082
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

01:01:30.498 --> 01:01:33.746
But they are women and you are men,

01:01:33.937 --> 01:01:36.851
and God has made men and women.

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.998
If it was to make a unisex,

01:01:39.141 --> 01:01:41.641
He would have made unisex, He did not.

01:01:43.014 --> 01:01:46.326
So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:51.220
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

01:01:51.651 --> 01:01:54.160
And you must know this is Woman's party!

01:01:54.508 --> 01:01:57.557
In India we have this thing like, you know,

01:01:57.724 --> 01:02:00.816
I was married in a family,

01:02:00.903 --> 01:02:03.914
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

01:02:04.113 --> 01:02:06.844
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of my husband,

01:02:07.012 --> 01:02:10.998
so, he told my elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

01:02:11.422 --> 01:02:13.281
my friend come and see Me.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.554
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for him

01:02:19.756 --> 01:02:23.099
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

01:02:23.338 --> 01:02:26.778
and told his wife that "See that she goes and sees the collector".

01:02:27.154 --> 01:02:29.075
See how beautiful it was,

01:02:32.986 --> 01:02:35.192
how beautiful it was,

01:02:37.514 --> 01:02:40.000
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

01:02:40.112 --> 01:02:43.764
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:50.430
But for this what you need is Pure Intelligence.

01:02:51.354 --> 01:02:54.552
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

01:02:54.849 --> 01:02:57.653
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down her husband.

01:02:57.971 --> 01:03:02.282
If the woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

01:03:03.201 --> 01:03:06.914
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

01:03:07.195 --> 01:03:11.316
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

01:03:14.697 --> 01:03:18.651
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

01:03:18.834 --> 01:03:22.425
That person is the most sensitive,

01:03:22.918 --> 01:03:24.642
is the most intelligent.

01:03:25.025 --> 01:03:28.048
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

01:03:28.877 --> 01:03:31.434
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

01:03:31.593 --> 01:03:33.183
so, is better leave it to the book,

01:03:33.334 --> 01:03:35.455
and today let us have the puja

01:03:35.582 --> 01:03:37.153
May God Bless You.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.965
Any questions?

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:47.316
This means, I'll be spending some money?

01:03:48.732 --> 01:03:51.774
I don't know, there's no chance. I don't know when will spend.

01:03:51.964 --> 01:03:54.583
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

01:03:54.703 --> 01:03:56.337
That's why the money is for.

01:03:56.451 --> 01:03:58.189
Must give to others, you see.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:00.308
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.252
Just enjoy giving others.

01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:05.938
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
