00:02.642 --> 00:07.238
Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

02:21.654 --> 02:25.305
Today we have gathered to do the puja of Fatima Bi,

02:26.545 --> 02:29.830
who was the symbol of Gruha Laxmi,

02:30.882 --> 02:33.572
and so we are going to have the puja

02:34.220 --> 02:37.203
of the Gruha Laxmi principle within us.

02:40.218 --> 02:43.542
As the housewife has to finish every work,

02:44.207 --> 02:47.547
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

02:48.183 --> 02:52.147
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

02:52.533 --> 02:55.445
and then I could come for your puja,

02:55.803 --> 02:58.592
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

02:59.047 --> 03:02.491
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

03:06.006 --> 03:10.786
Now, the principle of Gruha Laxmi

03:12.298 --> 03:16.857
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

03:16.969 --> 03:20.574
it’s not a human being’s creation

03:23.731 --> 03:27.193
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

03:30.261 --> 03:36.431
The Gruha Laxmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

03:36.683 --> 03:41.032
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

03:42.799 --> 03:47.894
Now She is always born in a relationship

03:49.639 --> 03:57.560
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

03:58.329 --> 04:01.530
So She comes as sister or

04:01.788 --> 04:04.946
She comes as a daughter.

04:08.413 --> 04:11.055
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

04:12.648 --> 04:15.941
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

04:17.662 --> 04:22.614
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

04:24.788 --> 04:26.954
the religion into their hands

04:27.232 --> 04:30.784
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

04:32.308 --> 04:34.995
The attention was not paid so much

04:35.575 --> 04:38.299
towards the ascent of the person.

04:39.569 --> 04:43.645
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

04:44.351 --> 04:46.288
And He is the only one -

04:46.431 --> 04:50.574
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

04:52.287 --> 04:54.842
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

04:54.906 --> 04:57.159
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

04:57.548 --> 05:02.458
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
[brother of Jnaneshwara],

05:02.805 --> 05:05.950
which, you can go to Pune,

05:06.030 --> 05:08.013
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

05:42.092 --> 05:46.480
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

05:47.478 --> 05:52.511
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

05:56.067 --> 06:00.465
She stayed in her house, in her household

06:01.061 --> 06:05.026
and She observed what you call

06:05.466 --> 06:09.409
a kind of a panda
[? Pata: veil]

06:09.536 --> 06:14.397
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

06:16.019 --> 06:18.401
It is a symbol that a woman

06:18.950 --> 06:24.262
who is a housewife has to

06:28.307 --> 06:35.162
save her chastity by covering her face because

06:35.594 --> 06:38.847
She was a beautiful woman and

06:40.303 --> 06:46.531
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

06:47.580 --> 06:50.473
and She would have been definitely attacked

06:50.973 --> 06:55.008
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

06:55.501 --> 06:58.124
As you know, in the time of Christ,

06:58.870 --> 07:02.722
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

07:03.072 --> 07:06.314
had to be very, very potential personality

07:06.989 --> 07:10.866
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

07:13.883 --> 07:17.231
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

07:18.651 --> 07:24.047
so She allowed her sons

07:24.329 --> 07:27.186
or actually ordered them

07:28.316 --> 07:30.699
to fight those fanatics

07:31.372 --> 07:36.634
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

07:38.186 --> 07:41.710
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

07:42.498 --> 07:45.412
It’s a very beautiful thing how

07:46.379 --> 07:48.918
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

07:49.602 --> 07:53.032
took a form of Vishnumaya

07:56.125 --> 08:02.444
just to establish the beautiful principle of

08:06.659 --> 08:09.143
a housewife.

08:11.227 --> 08:14.123
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

08:14.978 --> 08:17.930
and She knew that her children will be killed.

08:20.428 --> 08:23.342
But these people are never killed,

08:23.700 --> 08:26.757
they never die nor do they suffer.

08:26.925 --> 08:30.419
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

08:31.645 --> 08:34.541
As a result of that,

08:37.119 --> 08:42.033
another system started where they respected saints;

08:42.355 --> 08:48.214
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

08:48.726 --> 08:50.950
or we can call them the people

08:51.188 --> 08:54.095
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

08:54.675 --> 08:58.519
Then we have got “Chisti”.

08:58.808 --> 09:04.773
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

09:05.196 --> 09:08.729
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

09:09.320 --> 09:13.464
But still they could not transcend

09:13.887 --> 09:20.186
the limits of religiosity.

09:21.594 --> 09:24.953
So they also became extremely fanatic.

09:25.707 --> 09:30.775
Firstly they would not see to

09:31.439 --> 09:34.994
another religion where they had saints.

09:35.329 --> 09:39.405
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

09:40.520 --> 09:46.355
and even when we had a great saint

09:47.019 --> 09:52.115
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

09:53.897 --> 09:59.054
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

09:59.277 --> 10:03.453
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

10:04.886 --> 10:09.395
We did not deny,

10:09.690 --> 10:12.170
as far as Hindus were concerned,

10:12.871 --> 10:18.000
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

10:18.925 --> 10:22.465
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

10:22.834 --> 10:25.658
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

10:26.378 --> 10:31.578
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

10:31.953 --> 10:35.511
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

10:35.641 --> 10:38.196
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

10:39.718 --> 10:41.947
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

10:42.871 --> 10:49.188
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

10:50.037 --> 10:54.205
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

10:54.693 --> 10:56.527
So they could not get out of it.

10:56.789 --> 10:59.967
So we have another one called Haji Malang

11:00.102 --> 11:03.715
who was worshipped by Hindus.

11:04.360 --> 11:07.354
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

11:10.151 --> 11:12.472
This Haji Malang

11:13.116 --> 11:17.736
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

11:18.179 --> 11:22.154
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

11:22.703 --> 11:24.713
just to counter balance.

11:25.047 --> 11:26.969
They did all kinds of things.

11:27.521 --> 11:30.012
There are many saints like that.

11:31.293 --> 11:37.121
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

11:37.733 --> 11:43.350
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

11:44.396 --> 11:46.961
of that place, which was very bad. Even

11:47.207 --> 11:51.114
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

11:51.805 --> 11:53.768
They all make an earnings,

11:53.919 --> 11:57.365
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

11:58.895 --> 12:04.510
So this saint died and was buried there.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.165
There were many people who were depending on it.

12:07.313 --> 12:10.816
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

12:11.776 --> 12:13.986
'What is your religion?'

12:14.745 --> 12:16.388
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.993
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

12:20.369 --> 12:22.877
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

12:24.437 --> 12:28.106
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

12:28.297 --> 12:30.209
They have no religions.

12:32.245 --> 12:36.284
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

12:36.741 --> 12:40.148
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

12:40.805 --> 12:43.678
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

12:43.734 --> 12:47.466
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

12:47.673 --> 12:50.185
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

12:50.463 --> 12:52.950
that they made a fanatic group.

12:53.731 --> 12:58.135
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

12:59.023 --> 13:02.381
against your innate religion within your-self

13:02.739 --> 13:05.238
because it creates poison.

13:06.966 --> 13:09.117
It's a venomous thing.

13:10.009 --> 13:12.540
It makes you hate others.

13:13.323 --> 13:15.609
When you start hating others,

13:16.104 --> 13:19.659
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

13:20.140 --> 13:24.395
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

13:28.338 --> 13:30.451
Hating any one

13:31.041 --> 13:34.644
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

13:34.796 --> 13:38.146
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

13:38.515 --> 13:40.969
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.630
They bite some one because that is their nature.

13:43.871 --> 13:46.404
They cut some one because that's their nature.

13:46.683 --> 13:48.628
They never hate someone.

13:48.924 --> 13:52.576
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

13:52.746 --> 13:57.946
is a speciality of human conception

13:58.154 --> 14:01.656
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

14:04.257 --> 14:07.005
And this horrible thing hatred

14:08.236 --> 14:12.182
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

14:12.735 --> 14:17.101
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

14:17.994 --> 14:22.424
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

14:22.548 --> 14:24.895
in every religion.

14:26.329 --> 14:29.282
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

14:29.458 --> 14:35.261
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

14:36.057 --> 14:41.344
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

14:42.056 --> 14:47.184
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

14:47.425 --> 14:51.863
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

14:54.544 --> 14:59.246
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

15:00.405 --> 15:03.079
to overcome that hatred,

15:03.548 --> 15:08.497
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

15:09.044 --> 15:12.454
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

15:12.672 --> 15:16.838
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

15:17.716 --> 15:23.067
How? In the family when you have a household,

15:26.600 --> 15:32.379
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

15:32.804 --> 15:39.331
between the children, between the husband and the children.

15:39.931 --> 15:44.575
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

15:45.261 --> 15:48.160
then how can she subdue it?

15:48.359 --> 15:53.378
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

15:53.650 --> 15:56.580
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

15:56.757 --> 15:59.614
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

16:00.234 --> 16:05.280
But the housewife's job is to smooth

16:06.474 --> 16:13.662
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

16:17.345 --> 16:20.249
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

16:20.506 --> 16:24.140
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

16:24.430 --> 16:27.604
'wherever the housewife is respected,

16:28.426 --> 16:31.180
there only the Gods reside'.

16:34.041 --> 16:38.226
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

16:39.382 --> 16:41.652
because we are no good for economics,

16:41.677 --> 16:44.678
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

16:44.840 --> 16:46.483
Men folk are useless,

16:46.668 --> 16:49.429
they don't know any household work or anything,

16:49.557 --> 16:52.985
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

16:53.128 --> 16:55.658
is maintained by the women of the household.

16:58.035 --> 17:02.831
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

17:04.422 --> 17:08.370
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

17:08.537 --> 17:11.865
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

17:13.402 --> 17:17.786
It's like the preservation of that

17:20.790 --> 17:24.608
principle of a housewife.

17:26.799 --> 17:29.774
But some men, I mean many of them,

17:30.181 --> 17:34.445
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

17:36.037 --> 17:38.846
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

17:40.590 --> 17:43.454
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

17:45.500 --> 17:47.715
But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

17:47.896 --> 17:49.654
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

17:49.757 --> 17:53.791
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

17:54.587 --> 17:58.892
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

17:59.171 --> 18:02.023
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

18:04.090 --> 18:07.282
[you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

18:07.880 --> 18:11.571
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

18:11.818 --> 18:13.963
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

18:14.269 --> 18:16.388
they have no love or respect for each other

18:16.698 --> 18:19.462
but they have an awe or fear.

18:21.219 --> 18:23.316
And they are afraid of such a woman.

18:23.763 --> 18:28.469
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
the husbands are better controlled.

18:30.472 --> 18:33.889
But their basic principle they lose.

18:34.702 --> 18:37.376
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

18:39.888 --> 18:42.271
and they land up in difficulties.

18:43.680 --> 18:47.142
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

18:47.269 --> 18:49.715
is to respect her chastity,

18:52.078 --> 18:56.119
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

18:58.235 --> 18:59.863
That is the steadiness of her.

19:00.043 --> 19:02.998
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

19:03.795 --> 19:08.449
If the wife is docile or obedient,

19:08.657 --> 19:14.426
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
Alright!

19:16.375 --> 19:20.375
But this woman, the housewife,

19:21.157 --> 19:25.174
has to know that she is not docile.

19:26.122 --> 19:30.783
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

19:31.794 --> 19:36.814
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

19:38.103 --> 19:41.129
If the husband is stupid, alright,

19:41.346 --> 19:43.790
he's stupid like a child, finished!

19:44.441 --> 19:47.453
But the husband has to know that he must

19:47.737 --> 19:50.709
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

19:51.786 --> 19:53.790
he's good for nothing.

19:56.101 --> 19:58.568
First thing is that he must see

19:58.799 --> 20:03.476
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

20:04.386 --> 20:06.219
Then the blessings flow.

20:06.438 --> 20:12.017
But in no way he should insult her

20:12.473 --> 20:15.447
or be unkind to her

20:15.674 --> 20:18.925
and raise his voice or say things to her.

20:19.052 --> 20:24.515
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

20:25.543 --> 20:28.027
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

20:28.150 --> 20:31.646
give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

20:32.263 --> 20:35.147
She has not to be dominating,

20:35.364 --> 20:39.411
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

20:40.108 --> 20:42.536
She is the source of peace,

20:44.388 --> 20:46.835
she is the source of joy

20:47.225 --> 20:49.655
and she is the peacemaker.

20:50.230 --> 20:53.316
If she is the one who creates problems,

20:53.794 --> 20:57.661
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

20:59.786 --> 21:03.296
So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

21:04.664 --> 21:08.229
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

21:08.351 --> 21:13.727
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

21:13.957 --> 21:17.833
your left Nabhi can never improve.

21:20.714 --> 21:25.532
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

21:26.450 --> 21:29.584
Now in the west the problem with women

21:29.700 --> 21:34.025
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

21:38.199 --> 21:42.416
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

21:43.416 --> 21:48.016
They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

21:48.302 --> 21:50.894
They are the queen of the house

21:51.648 --> 21:54.802
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

21:55.088 --> 21:57.088
young frivolous girl.

21:58.174 --> 22:01.880
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

22:02.349 --> 22:06.108
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

22:07.109 --> 22:11.082
that, does not behove a housewife.

22:11.257 --> 22:13.926
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

22:14.426 --> 22:18.128
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

22:18.296 --> 22:20.306
and when they have to fight.

22:21.626 --> 22:24.827
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

22:24.978 --> 22:29.060
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
that's the limit!

22:32.799 --> 22:36.362
They start always comparing themselves

22:36.902 --> 22:38.986
with the husband, to begin with.

22:39.407 --> 22:43.758
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

22:43.910 --> 22:47.443
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

22:47.613 --> 22:49.988
low family he has no money,

22:50.171 --> 22:52.633
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

22:53.118 --> 22:55.614
Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

22:56.321 --> 22:59.672
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

23:01.876 --> 23:06.767
Also in her own ways

23:07.299 --> 23:08.881
she will feel guilty,

23:09.509 --> 23:13.138
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

23:13.393 --> 23:17.284
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

23:18.688 --> 23:25.008
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

23:26.579 --> 23:29.686
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

23:30.013 --> 23:34.012
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

23:34.155 --> 23:37.528
by your strength, by everything

23:39.898 --> 23:43.988
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

23:45.692 --> 23:50.503
by dominating others, by strangling others,

23:51.130 --> 23:55.095
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

23:58.548 --> 24:00.960
frog in the well.

24:02.071 --> 24:05.943
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

24:06.007 --> 24:07.650
Lets have our house separately,

24:07.761 --> 24:10.843
nobody should come in the house'.
Even a rat won't enter that house.

24:12.976 --> 24:17.975
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

24:19.827 --> 24:23.681
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

24:24.475 --> 24:27.241
is the negative form of understanding.

24:27.852 --> 24:31.602
These are absolutely absurd things,

24:31.714 --> 24:36.294
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

24:38.456 --> 24:40.759
All this kind of selfishness,

24:41.045 --> 24:45.817
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

24:48.401 --> 24:51.173
But a thing of a housewife is,

24:51.316 --> 24:54.802
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

24:55.274 --> 24:58.847
For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

24:59.270 --> 25:01.468
So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

25:01.595 --> 25:03.928
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

25:04.408 --> 25:06.928
'But may be they would like to eat more.'

25:07.516 --> 25:09.765
'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

25:10.368 --> 25:12.751
'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

25:13.307 --> 25:16.804
So she thinks of her generosity.

25:17.098 --> 25:18.782
She enjoys her generosity.

25:19.449 --> 25:20.933
I have known many like that.

25:21.068 --> 25:23.972
Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

25:26.215 --> 25:28.516
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

25:28.596 --> 25:30.492
will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

25:30.603 --> 25:32.770
you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

25:33.000 --> 25:35.687
No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

25:35.823 --> 25:37.866
Then she just start thinking immediately.

25:38.018 --> 25:40.925
'What vegetables are available in the market?

25:41.227 --> 25:43.332
What should I get? What is the best?'

25:43.491 --> 25:48.339
I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

25:48.536 --> 25:50.760
I am just a relation,

25:51.603 --> 25:54.740
but they want to express their love through the food,

25:54.879 --> 25:59.792
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

26:01.425 --> 26:03.710
and this is one of  the quality,

26:03.801 --> 26:06.210
the generosity for woman doesn't have

26:06.562 --> 26:09.810
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

26:11.583 --> 26:15.071
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

26:17.576 --> 26:19.919
but wife has to be very generous

26:20.062 --> 26:22.728
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

26:23.932 --> 26:27.210
not to her own children but to others.

26:29.199 --> 26:33.535
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

26:34.791 --> 26:37.524
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

26:38.706 --> 26:42.416
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

26:44.882 --> 26:48.121
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

26:48.781 --> 26:53.468
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

26:56.817 --> 27:00.198
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

27:00.643 --> 27:04.940
but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

27:05.223 --> 27:10.455
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

27:11.733 --> 27:13.976
about your own understanding.

27:14.175 --> 27:16.715
You are not aware of yourself.

27:18.078 --> 27:22.474
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

27:22.979 --> 27:26.820
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

27:30.042 --> 27:32.494
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

27:32.637 --> 27:34.359
Alright, leave it for a while.

27:34.536 --> 27:36.723
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

27:36.811 --> 27:39.644
'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

27:41.530 --> 27:44.413
The women must understand the men.

27:44.937 --> 27:48.478
They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

27:49.809 --> 27:52.277
They see everything in a big way, you see.

27:52.861 --> 27:56.804
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

27:58.035 --> 27:59.750
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

27:59.869 --> 28:01.710
They are too above these things.

28:02.080 --> 28:05.997
They are above these things. You must understand that!

28:07.598 --> 28:11.876
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

28:12.610 --> 28:15.459
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

28:16.023 --> 28:19.614
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

28:21.588 --> 28:23.667
It is coming to that point.

28:24.048 --> 28:26.822
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

28:26.957 --> 28:29.967
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

28:30.071 --> 28:32.644
without any moustaches.

28:37.715 --> 28:40.470
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

28:40.844 --> 28:43.386
But there is no subordination of any kind.

28:43.474 --> 28:45.832
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

28:46.016 --> 28:49.271
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

28:49.663 --> 28:52.173
and, above all, to your righteousness

28:53.165 --> 28:56.621
because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

28:58.476 --> 29:00.690
has to look after that side.

29:02.214 --> 29:03.916
How many quarrels you create?

29:04.068 --> 29:08.508
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

29:08.722 --> 29:11.327
Supposing we send two peacemakers

29:11.653 --> 29:15.261
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

29:16.454 --> 29:18.716
what will you say to such a thing?

29:20.427 --> 29:23.706
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

29:24.913 --> 29:29.227
you have  the one who has to bring such

29:30.613 --> 29:34.567
expression of love, such sweet things

29:37.636 --> 29:43.584
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

29:44.119 --> 29:46.102
because you are the mother.

29:46.534 --> 29:49.232
The family must feel secured within you

29:50.171 --> 29:53.475
and this love is your power.

29:55.927 --> 29:58.577
This is your power that you can give love

29:59.008 --> 30:03.455
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

30:04.873 --> 30:08.365
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

30:08.468 --> 30:10.865
I don't know I'll have to build another house!

30:11.066 --> 30:13.303
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

30:13.406 --> 30:15.192
I will not take any individual presents."

30:15.224 --> 30:17.900
Now still despite that. I don't know,

30:18.107 --> 30:23.783
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

30:25.002 --> 30:29.202
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

30:29.313 --> 30:31.426
You are some times surprised.

30:33.687 --> 30:37.409
I'll give you one simple example of my own life

30:37.544 --> 30:41.119
which will tell you how love can work it out.

30:41.738 --> 30:45.059
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

30:45.675 --> 30:48.016
And once I was in Delhi,

30:48.270 --> 30:53.155
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

30:53.270 --> 30:54.723
sitting outside in the lawn,

30:55.096 --> 30:58.830
when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

30:59.188 --> 31:01.500
and they came and said, "See now we are...

31:01.738 --> 31:05.121
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

31:05.240 --> 31:07.911
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

31:08.078 --> 31:09.310
and he is a Muslim,

31:09.485 --> 31:12.716
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

31:13.264 --> 31:15.517
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

31:15.613 --> 31:16.827
they were quite alright.

31:17.284 --> 31:20.422
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

31:20.645 --> 31:22.863
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

31:22.967 --> 31:25.048
and a bathroom and this thing,

31:25.215 --> 31:27.695
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

31:27.828 --> 31:30.084
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

31:31.537 --> 31:33.462
In the evening my brother came in.

31:33.614 --> 31:35.462
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

31:35.598 --> 31:36.631
he said "What is this?

31:36.719 --> 31:38.917
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

31:39.139 --> 31:43.159
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

31:43.397 --> 31:45.047
my husband came, he also joined him

31:45.151 --> 31:48.420
because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

31:49.322 --> 31:51.440
All men just the same, you see,

31:51.743 --> 31:53.674
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

31:53.761 --> 31:55.707
she has kept these three persons here.

31:55.874 --> 31:58.812
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

31:58.924 --> 32:01.316
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

32:01.452 --> 32:04.644
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

32:04.771 --> 32:06.273
all kind of things.

32:07.977 --> 32:09.857
Next morning they forgot about that.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.296
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

32:13.836 --> 32:15.783
I can't drag them out today, one night."

32:15.942 --> 32:18.382
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

32:18.723 --> 32:19.804
That's like men!

32:19.900 --> 32:21.868
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

32:21.987 --> 32:25.364
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

32:25.690 --> 32:28.524
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

32:29.168 --> 32:31.553
Next morning they went away for their work.

32:31.656 --> 32:34.251
They had no time. It was, you see,

32:34.363 --> 32:37.880
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

32:38.095 --> 32:41.224
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

32:42.364 --> 32:45.775
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

32:46.144 --> 32:49.321
Then this lady got a job

32:50.361 --> 32:55.859
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

32:56.145 --> 33:00.694
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

33:01.123 --> 33:07.915
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

33:08.376 --> 33:10.181
It had a reflection in Delhi

33:10.261 --> 33:12.594
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

33:13.027 --> 33:16.948
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

33:17.083 --> 33:20.738
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

33:21.066 --> 33:22.883
I said, "No. How can I have?"

33:23.360 --> 33:25.538
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

33:25.809 --> 33:28.723
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

33:29.025 --> 33:31.235
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

33:32.291 --> 33:35.619
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

33:39.364 --> 33:42.143
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

33:42.262 --> 33:44.699
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

33:44.818 --> 33:46.365
because I will not allow you!"

33:46.500 --> 33:48.627
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

33:48.833 --> 33:53.614
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

33:53.752 --> 33:55.659
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

33:55.755 --> 33:58.326
I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

33:58.778 --> 34:00.098
His life was saved.

34:00.603 --> 34:03.071
Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

34:03.213 --> 34:06.206
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

34:08.065 --> 34:10.689
and this lady became a great actress,

34:11.460 --> 34:13.034
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

34:13.201 --> 34:15.716
the one who used to act like a mother?

34:17.190 --> 34:20.367
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

34:21.693 --> 34:24.324
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

34:24.452 --> 34:26.292
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

34:26.499 --> 34:29.661
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

34:29.868 --> 34:31.633
they will just go mad about Me,"

34:31.712 --> 34:33.926
and I said "I have no time for all that."

34:34.268 --> 34:39.075
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

34:39.158 --> 34:40.380
to give them some good films.

34:40.467 --> 34:43.159
But it all made into a farce, later on.

34:43.388 --> 34:45.533
They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

34:45.867 --> 34:50.305
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

34:50.623 --> 34:52.303
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

34:52.383 --> 34:54.525
I have said, I have anything to do with it."

34:55.805 --> 35:00.904
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

35:02.965 --> 35:05.673
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

35:05.761 --> 35:08.461
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

35:08.589 --> 35:11.352
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

35:11.488 --> 35:12.846
You will have to give me Sari.

35:12.934 --> 35:14.688
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

35:14.765 --> 35:16.696
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

35:16.815 --> 35:18.539
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

35:18.651 --> 35:21.436
big muhurat is the one where you start it.

35:22.109 --> 35:25.532
So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

35:25.710 --> 35:27.791
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

35:27.911 --> 35:29.579
that she has seen Me after twelve years.

35:29.691 --> 35:31.805
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

35:32.041 --> 35:34.940
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

35:35.599 --> 35:37.546
fell into my arms

35:37.969 --> 35:41.511
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

35:41.662 --> 35:43.664
I have been trying to trace you out."

35:43.928 --> 35:47.121
Then she started describing Me and all.

35:47.264 --> 35:50.052
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

35:50.311 --> 35:53.308
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

35:53.629 --> 35:56.599
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

35:56.710 --> 35:58.400
we'll give our lives for Her!"

35:58.742 --> 36:01.024
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

36:01.136 --> 36:03.765
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

36:03.979 --> 36:05.046
Nothing doing. "

36:05.275 --> 36:06.275
See now,

36:06.683 --> 36:09.914
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

36:10.224 --> 36:13.870
I didn't have so many rights on

36:14.692 --> 36:17.654
my husband's property, or anything,

36:17.758 --> 36:19.918
and my brother another dominating fellow,

36:20.148 --> 36:22.777
both of them put together,

36:23.000 --> 36:25.414
just were about to kill me that night,

36:26.232 --> 36:29.268
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

36:30.070 --> 36:32.360
and then you know when I told my husband

36:32.480 --> 36:34.599
and my brother, they were amazed.

36:34.758 --> 36:37.268
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

36:37.706 --> 36:39.214
and see the change,

36:39.643 --> 36:41.980
how much they have...",

36:42.592 --> 36:45.262
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

36:45.350 --> 36:47.200
no to any charitable institution.

36:47.311 --> 36:49.233
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

36:49.400 --> 36:54.420
And the whole idea of a...

36:55.042 --> 36:59.520
earning and money just toppled down.

36:59.793 --> 37:03.038
And she has acted in many films for charity

37:03.753 --> 37:08.378
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

37:11.304 --> 37:15.933
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

37:17.034 --> 37:19.248
because she herself is charitable.

37:20.026 --> 37:22.663
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

37:23.946 --> 37:26.231
And she can create beauty around her,

37:26.552 --> 37:30.474
in her household, in her family, in her society.

37:30.633 --> 37:32.477
Everywhere. But no!

37:32.646 --> 37:36.098
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

37:36.577 --> 37:41.382
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

37:43.683 --> 37:45.255
[UNCLEAR]

37:45.422 --> 37:49.406
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

37:52.795 --> 37:56.533
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

37:56.644 --> 37:59.727
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

37:59.982 --> 38:02.373
and that they have to be told.

38:03.067 --> 38:04.876
But this is not the way!

38:05.387 --> 38:10.894
There is another way of improving these men, who try to

38:12.459 --> 38:13.711
destroy the women,

38:13.981 --> 38:18.920
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

38:21.419 --> 38:23.981
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

38:24.306 --> 38:27.223
He will never side with men if they are chaste

38:27.596 --> 38:30.457
and do not try to show off their body

38:30.648 --> 38:33.290
and show off their beauty and want to make,

38:33.522 --> 38:35.827
sort of, a capital out of it.

38:38.879 --> 38:42.635
Such women are extremely powerful,

38:44.123 --> 38:46.657
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

38:46.935 --> 38:48.461
when it comes to anything

38:48.612 --> 38:52.122
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

38:52.599 --> 38:54.021
She fought the British.

38:54.228 --> 38:55.968
And the British also

38:56.389 --> 38:58.645
were surprised at her valour and they said that

38:58.772 --> 39:00.369
we had got Jhansi, alright,

39:00.822 --> 39:03.658
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.188
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

39:09.419 --> 39:12.905
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

39:13.034 --> 39:16.487
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

39:17.587 --> 39:20.407
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

39:20.614 --> 39:24.004
who have been great women, who were housewives.

39:27.383 --> 39:34.149
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

39:34.380 --> 39:35.940
or potential of any energy.

39:36.091 --> 39:38.988
Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

39:39.115 --> 39:41.443
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

39:41.721 --> 39:44.922
one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

39:46.123 --> 39:48.159
So one has to understand that we are potential

39:48.334 --> 39:52.304
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

39:52.553 --> 39:55.370
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

39:55.617 --> 39:59.201
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

39:59.614 --> 40:01.608
But men are another stupid stuff

40:01.974 --> 40:04.699
because they will not respect a woman

40:04.897 --> 40:07.471
who loves them, who is chaste,

40:07.665 --> 40:10.839
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

40:10.993 --> 40:13.994
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

40:14.161 --> 40:17.616
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

40:17.768 --> 40:21.056
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

40:21.239 --> 40:25.268
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

40:25.715 --> 40:29.479
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

40:32.016 --> 40:37.280
What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

40:38.201 --> 40:40.481
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

40:40.763 --> 40:42.215
that the way they get attracted.

40:42.747 --> 40:45.608
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

40:45.870 --> 40:48.022
women become very insecure

40:48.550 --> 40:51.010
and they get insecured. As a result,

40:51.217 --> 40:53.807
the men suffer and women suffer.

40:55.175 --> 40:58.453
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

40:58.813 --> 41:03.902
will consequently get blood cancer.

41:11.923 --> 41:14.121
And the woman who behaves like this,

41:16.636 --> 41:21.026
in this manner and if she ill-treats

41:21.376 --> 41:24.791
her husband, will get asthma

41:25.397 --> 41:30.798
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

41:33.327 --> 41:36.771
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

41:38.365 --> 41:41.389
could be complete dehydration of the body.

41:46.619 --> 41:49.262
Because left nabhi is so important.

41:50.405 --> 41:53.698
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

41:53.881 --> 41:58.565
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

41:59.281 --> 42:03.307
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

42:03.771 --> 42:05.298
I have always seen

42:05.552 --> 42:09.845
that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

42:11.946 --> 42:14.504
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

42:14.615 --> 42:17.006
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

42:17.070 --> 42:19.627
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

42:19.815 --> 42:22.153
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

42:22.733 --> 42:26.348
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

42:27.566 --> 42:30.742
He gets something for the jumping

42:30.984 --> 42:34.674
and she gets something for her torturing.

42:35.211 --> 42:39.663
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

42:43.368 --> 42:45.704
This so-called figure madness,

42:46.167 --> 42:49.476
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

42:49.860 --> 42:54.806
It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

42:57.956 --> 43:00.574
Women have to be settled down women.

43:01.818 --> 43:03.818
They have to be Grahasthis,

43:04.050 --> 43:06.541
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

43:06.806 --> 43:09.179
Said to be satisfied with her household.

43:09.698 --> 43:11.612
If she is all the time running about,

43:11.715 --> 43:13.296
she doesn't want to stay in the house

43:13.424 --> 43:17.609
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

43:20.038 --> 43:24.816
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

43:25.046 --> 43:27.231
and then she was made a housewife

43:27.581 --> 43:29.647
but she could not stop her running about

43:29.838 --> 43:31.743
because she was a maid servant.

43:33.621 --> 43:35.536
She doesn't settle in the household.

43:35.814 --> 43:39.713
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

43:39.861 --> 43:43.185
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

43:43.508 --> 43:45.603
but for others to welcome.

43:46.302 --> 43:49.321
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

43:49.432 --> 43:51.765
to come and sit and enjoy.

43:52.860 --> 43:55.325
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

43:55.436 --> 43:58.232
we find that people, after marriage,

43:58.368 --> 44:02.633
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

44:04.123 --> 44:07.775
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

44:08.069 --> 44:11.293
and disobedient, torturesome.

44:12.249 --> 44:16.509
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

44:18.097 --> 44:19.617
Not that I punish this,

44:19.781 --> 44:22.161
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

44:22.270 --> 44:25.212
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

44:25.451 --> 44:28.466
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

44:31.450 --> 44:34.026
Then children become funny.

44:35.820 --> 44:38.136
Just for your family, just for your food,

44:38.245 --> 44:41.764
just for your household, this selfishness,

44:43.004 --> 44:46.170
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

44:46.387 --> 44:49.314
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

44:49.783 --> 44:52.286
but if the man is a gone case,

44:55.938 --> 44:58.288
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

44:58.433 --> 45:01.779
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

45:03.200 --> 45:07.801
Our family is not of one man one woman

45:08.161 --> 45:10.657
but the whole universe is our family.

45:13.037 --> 45:15.409
We are not on our own,

45:16.058 --> 45:19.535
and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

45:20.284 --> 45:23.046
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

45:23.444 --> 45:26.090
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

45:26.457 --> 45:27.892
a day will come,

45:28.094 --> 45:32.623
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

45:33.453 --> 45:38.465
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

45:38.573 --> 45:41.487
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

45:44.370 --> 45:48.640
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

45:48.834 --> 45:52.621
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

45:52.738 --> 45:53.964
group of women,

45:54.189 --> 45:58.272
she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

46:05.086 --> 46:07.849
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

46:07.986 --> 46:11.613
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

46:11.823 --> 46:15.386
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

46:19.307 --> 46:22.611
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

46:22.763 --> 46:26.051
Not because it is a punishment from God.

46:29.707 --> 46:33.206
So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

46:34.908 --> 46:39.753
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

46:39.919 --> 46:43.857
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

46:48.096 --> 46:51.746
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

46:54.139 --> 46:57.126
Those women who have tried such tricks,

46:58.012 --> 47:01.114
should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

47:01.230 --> 47:03.306
Nobody respects such a woman.

47:04.834 --> 47:08.022
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

47:09.342 --> 47:11.620
The leader's wife or the leadership

47:11.736 --> 47:19.294
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

47:20.016 --> 47:22.006
Most insignificant.

47:24.298 --> 47:28.280
What you got is much higher than this.

47:30.320 --> 47:35.196
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

47:35.807 --> 47:38.296
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

47:44.469 --> 47:46.207
Is the minimal of minimal.

47:46.560 --> 47:48.234
Is the lowest of lowest.

47:48.551 --> 47:52.388
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

47:53.887 --> 47:56.448
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

47:58.690 --> 48:01.727
But that service itself is enjoyment.

48:02.916 --> 48:04.870
But if you just keep to service.

48:05.109 --> 48:09.184
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

48:10.228 --> 48:15.710
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

48:16.380 --> 48:18.515
You can be used for a cross!

48:23.682 --> 48:26.002
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

48:26.137 --> 48:29.849
unless and until you have that essence

48:29.976 --> 48:33.377
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

48:35.317 --> 48:40.332
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

48:41.530 --> 48:45.498
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

48:45.991 --> 48:47.787
then what is left?

48:48.867 --> 48:51.989
In the same way, all the so-called service

48:52.092 --> 48:54.467
and seva and tapasya

48:54.690 --> 48:57.954
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

48:59.974 --> 49:03.024
So the essence of all this is sweetness

49:04.594 --> 49:07.157
and that is generated by women.

49:09.196 --> 49:11.553
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

49:11.704 --> 49:13.649
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

49:13.817 --> 49:17.200
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

49:22.733 --> 49:26.153
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

49:27.207 --> 49:29.350
It's a good thing in a way.

49:30.557 --> 49:34.647
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

49:39.068 --> 49:41.276
But to make him all the time slave,

49:41.395 --> 49:44.204
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

49:44.367 --> 49:46.588
Is not the job of a housewife!

49:50.604 --> 49:55.831
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

49:57.069 --> 49:58.434
She gives you everything.

49:58.530 --> 50:01.640
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

50:02.218 --> 50:03.736
Such powers She has.

50:03.895 --> 50:06.816
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

50:07.311 --> 50:10.979
You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

50:11.075 --> 50:14.800
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

50:15.026 --> 50:19.448
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

50:19.571 --> 50:22.158
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

50:22.365 --> 50:23.955
Least expected!

50:25.920 --> 50:27.824
Never in life-time.

50:29.102 --> 50:31.113
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

50:31.319 --> 50:33.406
First time, I said something and see the effect.

50:33.510 --> 50:36.033
Because I've never said him!

50:38.818 --> 50:42.119
So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

50:42.302 --> 50:44.812
satisfied in her self because she has to give.

50:44.911 --> 50:47.792
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

50:47.994 --> 50:50.699
She has to give love because she is love.

50:51.220 --> 50:53.719
She has to give all the services.

50:53.839 --> 50:55.761
She has to give all the possessions,

50:55.904 --> 50:59.216
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

50:59.336 --> 51:01.291
what a responsibility!

51:02.172 --> 51:05.389
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

51:05.559 --> 51:07.289
is the responsibility of a woman,

51:07.424 --> 51:10.617
and she should feel proud of it,
that such a responsibility has come to me.

51:11.348 --> 51:12.720
A housewife

51:12.872 --> 51:16.387
has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

51:17.384 --> 51:21.616
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

51:23.303 --> 51:25.342
because they think they have become leaders.

51:25.493 --> 51:27.059
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

51:27.178 --> 51:30.768
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

51:32.899 --> 51:36.791
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

51:37.370 --> 51:41.351
I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

51:45.285 --> 51:48.756
and each one of them adores Me.

51:49.288 --> 51:51.704
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

51:51.855 --> 51:54.135
all of them will come from all over to see  me

51:54.215 --> 51:57.336
but my husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

51:58.238 --> 52:02.431
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
and they come and see me, not him!

52:05.120 --> 52:07.152
If I had not given them love,

52:07.287 --> 52:09.703
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

52:10.136 --> 52:12.017
they would have not come to Me.

52:13.490 --> 52:17.594
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

52:17.892 --> 52:20.796
They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

52:22.784 --> 52:26.230
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

52:26.365 --> 52:27.995
many stupid women.

52:28.448 --> 52:31.846
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

52:34.011 --> 52:36.979
Because they don't know what power they have got.

52:40.463 --> 52:43.669
They don't know what responsibility they have.

52:45.403 --> 52:47.673
I'm an example before them.

52:51.954 --> 52:55.572
And this is the very big problem with me that practically

52:55.866 --> 52:59.058
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

52:59.250 --> 53:01.681
I must say, horrible.

53:04.195 --> 53:06.750
And Sahaja Yoga goes 'dhup' like that with them.

53:07.778 --> 53:09.698
They can't live in an ashram,

53:09.833 --> 53:12.956
they will have their food,
the husband must see that they have their food.

53:13.075 --> 53:15.903
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

53:16.086 --> 53:19.675
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

53:23.279 --> 53:26.739
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

53:26.890 --> 53:29.812
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

53:32.750 --> 53:33.987
But No, they sit down,

53:34.123 --> 53:36.924
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

53:37.607 --> 53:40.308
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

53:40.443 --> 53:42.303
Just do that! Do this!"

53:46.731 --> 53:49.079
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

53:50.108 --> 53:53.861
Every wife of a leader

53:54.110 --> 53:59.006
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

54:03.775 --> 54:06.568
They have to cook. And with heart.

54:07.040 --> 54:11.134
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

54:11.764 --> 54:14.164
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

54:16.690 --> 54:19.594
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

54:19.869 --> 54:22.887
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

54:23.197 --> 54:26.271
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

54:26.401 --> 54:28.599
encourage their niceness.

54:28.901 --> 54:31.357
Also I have seen, some very good ladies

54:31.429 --> 54:34.311
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

54:34.415 --> 54:35.672
After marriage they are lost.

54:35.736 --> 54:38.941
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

54:41.139 --> 54:44.964
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
otherwise they are not there.

54:45.943 --> 54:49.787
Today I was asking Arnaud,
he told me so many of them are like that here.

54:50.695 --> 54:53.515
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

54:54.923 --> 54:57.240
because before marriage they were better off.

54:58.795 --> 55:03.397
So how much it is important, a Gruhakshmi Principle with in us,

55:03.810 --> 55:05.696
for us to be together,

55:05.959 --> 55:09.149
to us to grow together. To feel the togetherness,

55:09.398 --> 55:11.897
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

55:12.570 --> 55:16.038
So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

55:16.197 --> 55:17.855
the Ragas we have.

55:18.086 --> 55:19.900
Ra is energy.

55:20.734 --> 55:24.540
Ga is in Sanskrit language 'Ga, Gayathi'  means 'which penetrates',

55:24.699 --> 55:26.040
'which moves into everything',

55:27.223 --> 55:30.265
it's the ethereal, etheric qualities.

55:31.152 --> 55:33.096
etheric...... into which you see

55:33.263 --> 55:36.136
You put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

55:36.946 --> 55:41.393
So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

55:42.922 --> 55:45.358
and touches your spirit.

55:47.250 --> 55:48.694
That is the Raga.

55:49.324 --> 55:54.796
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

55:59.845 --> 56:03.900
Supposing if you stand with a military band

56:04.367 --> 56:07.580
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

56:09.418 --> 56:13.515
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

56:13.725 --> 56:18.575
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

56:20.247 --> 56:23.429
The way the housewife decorates the house.

56:23.885 --> 56:28.021
She smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

56:28.232 --> 56:30.177
Then she's looking after everyone.

56:30.257 --> 56:32.376
Everybody knows she is standing there.

56:32.544 --> 56:36.658
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

56:36.921 --> 56:40.479
some people for birthday cake of your child

56:40.733 --> 56:42.808
and you cut the cake first

56:43.753 --> 56:45.700
because you are the housewife.

56:46.566 --> 56:50.164
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

56:51.040 --> 56:54.376
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

56:54.646 --> 56:57.919
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

56:59.916 --> 57:01.935
Look after all of them,

57:03.364 --> 57:07.814
and this is what is a Raga is.

57:07.876 --> 57:12.485
It caters to all your angularities.

57:12.589 --> 57:15.710
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

57:15.798 --> 57:18.467
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

57:19.257 --> 57:20.883
It soothes you down.

57:22.642 --> 57:24.856
It makes you settle down.

57:25.602 --> 57:30.798
Like people come home for five days, live like

57:31.381 --> 57:33.721
I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

57:33.986 --> 57:36.932
and live in a tent-like thing

57:37.083 --> 57:40.181
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

57:40.946 --> 57:42.819
or they go and stay in a hotel.

57:43.224 --> 57:45.465
Nobody wants to stay in the house

57:46.037 --> 57:49.262
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

57:52.027 --> 57:55.619
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

57:55.814 --> 57:58.931
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

57:59.046 --> 58:02.720
Imagine somebody listening to a raga when he's a jumpy.

58:05.010 --> 58:06.734
So, one has to settle down

58:07.139 --> 58:12.557
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

58:12.836 --> 58:14.457
who is a housewife,

58:14.760 --> 58:18.325
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

58:18.923 --> 58:22.702
As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

58:22.824 --> 58:24.784
in the modern times, much more,

58:25.227 --> 58:29.772
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

58:30.165 --> 58:32.156
Is that the wife...

58:32.906 --> 58:35.995
normally in India before, you see,

58:36.075 --> 58:38.363
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

58:38.593 --> 58:40.715
all the time his wife is not with him.

58:40.977 --> 58:43.852
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

58:44.152 --> 58:48.130
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

58:48.845 --> 58:51.379
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

58:51.707 --> 58:53.389
then they have a divorce.

58:54.139 --> 58:57.007
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

58:57.165 --> 58:59.467
household, Sahaja Yoga, things like that.

58:59.962 --> 59:03.535
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

59:04.204 --> 59:06.524
sits on the ground, in India.

59:06.715 --> 59:09.257
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

59:09.360 --> 59:12.282
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

59:12.420 --> 59:16.747
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

59:18.165 --> 59:20.117
Or  "This lady was quarrelling

59:20.237 --> 59:22.905
or I met another lady she was telling me you were this

59:23.019 --> 59:26.209
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

59:27.175 --> 59:28.515
That's why in India

59:28.635 --> 59:30.722
if husband has to show his temper he doesn't eat

59:30.825 --> 59:33.876
his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

59:38.085 --> 59:39.913
That is how, they show their temper.

59:40.167 --> 59:43.119
So then she fans the husband slowly

59:43.321 --> 59:46.973
and tells him good things, you see, today you know why?

59:47.222 --> 59:51.263
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

59:51.965 --> 59:54.823
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes. He said, he said so".

59:55.088 --> 59:58.366
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

01:00:02.158 --> 01:00:04.279
but you see all nice things, you see,

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:07.544
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

01:00:07.706 --> 01:00:09.775
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

01:00:09.904 --> 01:00:11.507
And your sister is coming.

01:00:11.635 --> 01:00:13.611
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

01:00:13.771 --> 01:00:15.787
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

01:00:16.033 --> 01:00:20.255
So he eats his food nicely then he goes washes his hands

01:00:20.541 --> 01:00:23.280
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

01:00:23.465 --> 01:00:25.601
where there is a jam, always.

01:00:26.287 --> 01:00:31.400
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

01:00:31.841 --> 01:00:35.088
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

01:00:35.319 --> 01:00:37.591
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

01:00:37.790 --> 01:00:40.228
that on the periphery of the

01:00:41.517 --> 01:00:43.630
wheel you have the speed

01:00:43.865 --> 01:00:48.548
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahaja Yogis have to be at the axis,

01:00:49.296 --> 01:00:53.671
and so the husband and the wife,
the left and the right side of a chariot

01:00:54.055 --> 01:00:56.175
have to be on the axis

01:00:56.398 --> 01:00:59.233
and the left is left and the right is right.

01:00:59.775 --> 01:01:02.428
Now the women always take more time to get ready.

01:01:02.579 --> 01:01:04.914
Not me, I take less than My husband,

01:01:05.535 --> 01:01:09.846
much less than my husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

01:01:10.389 --> 01:01:13.954
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

01:01:14.099 --> 01:01:17.402
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

01:01:17.609 --> 01:01:19.785
Men must see their watches ten times.

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:24.790
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

01:01:25.013 --> 01:01:26.612
if they are real women.

01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:30.082
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

01:01:30.498 --> 01:01:33.746
But they are women and you are men,

01:01:33.937 --> 01:01:36.851
and God has made men and women.

01:01:37.100 --> 01:01:38.998
If it was to make a unisex,

01:01:39.141 --> 01:01:41.641
He would have made unisex, He did not.

01:01:43.014 --> 01:01:46.326
So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:51.220
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

01:01:51.651 --> 01:01:54.160
And you must know this is Woman's party!

01:01:54.508 --> 01:01:57.557
In India we have this thing like, you know,

01:01:57.724 --> 01:02:00.816
I was married in a family,

01:02:00.903 --> 01:02:03.914
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

01:02:04.113 --> 01:02:06.844
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of my husband,

01:02:07.012 --> 01:02:10.998
so, he told my elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

01:02:11.422 --> 01:02:13.281
my friend come and see Me.

01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:19.554
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for him

01:02:19.756 --> 01:02:23.099
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

01:02:23.338 --> 01:02:26.778
and told his wife that "See that she goes and sees the collector".

01:02:27.154 --> 01:02:29.075
See how beautiful it was,

01:02:32.986 --> 01:02:35.192
how beautiful it was,

01:02:37.514 --> 01:02:40.000
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

01:02:40.112 --> 01:02:43.764
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

01:02:46.363 --> 01:02:50.430
But for this what you need is Pure Intelligence.

01:02:51.354 --> 01:02:54.552
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

01:02:54.849 --> 01:02:57.653
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down her husband.

01:02:57.971 --> 01:03:02.282
If the woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

01:03:03.201 --> 01:03:06.914
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

01:03:07.195 --> 01:03:11.316
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

01:03:14.697 --> 01:03:18.651
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

01:03:18.834 --> 01:03:22.425
That person is the most sensitive,

01:03:22.918 --> 01:03:24.642
is the most intelligent.

01:03:25.025 --> 01:03:28.048
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

01:03:28.877 --> 01:03:31.434
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

01:03:31.593 --> 01:03:33.183
so, is better leave it to the book,

01:03:33.334 --> 01:03:35.455
and today let us have the puja

01:03:35.582 --> 01:03:37.153
May God Bless You.

01:03:37.260 --> 01:03:38.965
Any questions?

01:03:44.657 --> 01:03:47.316
This means, I'll be spending some money?

01:03:48.732 --> 01:03:51.774
I don't know, there's no chance. I don't know when will spend.

01:03:51.964 --> 01:03:54.583
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

01:03:54.703 --> 01:03:56.337
That's why the money is for.

01:03:56.451 --> 01:03:58.189
Must give to others, you see.

01:03:58.252 --> 01:04:00.308
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

01:04:00.360 --> 01:04:02.252
Just enjoy giving others.

01:04:03.351 --> 01:04:05.938
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
