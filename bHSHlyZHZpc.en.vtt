00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:51.088
﻿So, this is to thank you all for

00:03:51.718 --> 00:03:54.260
helping in building this house

00:03:56.743 --> 00:03:58.900
and making it so beautiful.

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.780
All the thankfulness

00:04:05.437 --> 00:04:07.186
is from

00:04:08.061 --> 00:04:10.374
us, both of us, to you.

00:04:13.331 --> 00:04:14.937
Today is a very

00:04:15.138 --> 00:04:17.643
interesting day when

00:04:17.843 --> 00:04:21.660
you are worshipping the Gruhalakshmi here,

00:04:22.424 --> 00:04:24.700
means the Gruhalakshmi of this house.

00:04:25.823 --> 00:04:27.424
In the same way

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.106
in your family also, in your houses, homes you must

00:04:32.306 --> 00:04:34.196
do Gruhalakshmis’ puja.

00:04:35.327 --> 00:04:37.316
The woman has to be

00:04:37.517 --> 00:04:39.528
the Gruhalakshmi herself

00:04:40.472 --> 00:04:42.672
and then she should be worshipped.

00:04:43.405 --> 00:04:46.355
“Yatya naria pujyante, tatra bhramante Devata.”

00:04:46.556 --> 00:04:48.780
Where the women are respected

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.522
and worshipped there

00:04:52.527 --> 00:04:55.155
reside all the deities.

00:04:55.356 --> 00:04:57.460
But they should be respectable also.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.828
If they are not respectable

00:05:00.028 --> 00:05:02.536
then the deities won’t reside there.

00:05:02.737 --> 00:05:04.315
So, it’s a big responsibility

00:05:04.515 --> 00:05:06.740
on a Gruhalakshmi to be respectable

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.859
so that all the deities are happy in the family.

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.300
And once she is respected,

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.860
she will try to be respectable also.

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.580
So, the respect

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.399
of the Gruhalakshmi is very important.

00:05:22.593 --> 00:05:24.180
Today

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:28.620
we are having this little puja

00:05:28.821 --> 00:05:30.826
from all the builders

00:05:31.026 --> 00:05:33.031
who helped us here,

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.499
with the blessings of Vishwakarma

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.368
and Brahmadeva;

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.718
those who have tried

00:05:40.055 --> 00:05:43.255
to make this house so beautiful.

00:05:44.811 --> 00:05:48.315
Also, as you know, Blake has described this house.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:51.060
It has a special significance

00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:54.198
and we have to now

00:05:54.398 --> 00:05:56.060
hand it over to somebody else,

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.700
the one who will appreciate and respect this house;

00:06:01.155 --> 00:06:04.500
who will understand the value and worth of this house.

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:07.283
And for that we have to pray

00:06:07.483 --> 00:06:09.802
that it will be sold to such a person

00:06:10.003 --> 00:06:13.804
who is a person who will be

00:06:14.005 --> 00:06:17.807
a connoisseur, a person who will understand

00:06:18.008 --> 00:06:20.980
the depth and the

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:23.660
aesthetics

00:06:24.422 --> 00:06:26.260
of this place

00:06:27.031 --> 00:06:30.387
and the one who will be paying for that,

00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:32.369
valuing that.

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:34.820
So, we have to ask

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.700
for such a blessing.

00:06:41.451 --> 00:06:44.142
Of course, one should not get attached to anything.

00:06:44.342 --> 00:06:46.180
Whatever is created,

00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:49.364
is created. One should never be attached.

00:06:49.564 --> 00:06:51.180
Because we have done this, so

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.780
we should be attached to it, is not the way a Sahaja

00:06:55.343 --> 00:06:56.877
Yogi should think about it.

00:06:57.078 --> 00:07:00.162
But one should think about that,
now we have created something beautiful

00:07:00.362 --> 00:07:02.140
we can recreate another thing

00:07:02.340 --> 00:07:05.283
and we can produce other better things.

00:07:05.483 --> 00:07:06.780
That’s how an artist

00:07:06.980 --> 00:07:09.617
can go on producing and producing.

00:07:09.818 --> 00:07:11.100
Of course,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.820
there’s one thing: that if there is

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:17.060
within us the joy,

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:23.013
then only you produce joy.

00:07:23.214 --> 00:07:25.540
If there is no joy you cannot.

00:07:27.194 --> 00:07:28.900
So first of all

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:31.330
before doing any work

00:07:31.531 --> 00:07:33.191
creating anything

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.420
one must measure up

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.820
the amount of

00:07:39.224 --> 00:07:41.138
joy one has received,

00:07:41.338 --> 00:07:44.496
the blessings one has received from the Divine,

00:07:44.902 --> 00:07:46.500
and then recreate.

00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:50.044
With that consciousness, with that awareness

00:07:50.245 --> 00:07:52.620
you’ll find your creation will be very beautiful.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.109
And we have to bring the world to a new

00:07:56.999 --> 00:07:59.620
method of creativity

00:08:00.235 --> 00:08:02.460
where there is exuberance,

00:08:02.872 --> 00:08:04.580
exuberance,

00:08:05.273 --> 00:08:08.691
of joy and

00:08:09.676 --> 00:08:13.300
of Divine aesthetics,

00:08:14.443 --> 00:08:17.288
because the world is going from bad to worse.

00:08:17.553 --> 00:08:20.756
I find nowadays people may just like to have

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:24.700
some sort of a white cloth hanging and calling it a painting.

00:08:25.268 --> 00:08:27.804
That’s not a painting because there is nothing inside.

00:08:28.005 --> 00:08:30.660
It has become hollow, empty; there’s nothing inside,

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:32.656
so that there is no exuberance.

00:08:32.857 --> 00:08:34.437
So, to recreate that,

00:08:34.637 --> 00:08:36.983
you people have to

00:08:37.874 --> 00:08:39.891
desire and ask for it,

00:08:40.091 --> 00:08:41.991
and we’ll have people of that kind.

00:08:42.192 --> 00:08:43.858
It is just to be desired,

00:08:44.058 --> 00:08:46.180
and you all should desire for such things:

00:08:46.584 --> 00:08:49.780
that people of exuberance should come forward

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:53.680
to value such things which are full of joy.

00:08:55.232 --> 00:08:56.700
May God bless you.

00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:05.166
And so what is this, first the Ganesha puja we’ll do?

00:41:43.487 --> 00:41:45.264
May God bless you all.

00:41:51.171 --> 00:41:52.979
May God bless this house.

00:41:53.179 --> 00:41:56.040
May God bless Mr. Shrivastava.

00:55:50.184 --> 00:55:53.660
If you eat all these things. I have done such a good cooking!

00:55:54.113 --> 00:55:56.943
I have to say you shouldn’t eat anything anymore

00:55:57.143 --> 00:55:59.647
because if you eat it then I’ll just vibrate it,

00:55:59.847 --> 00:56:03.700
but you people don’t eat anything
now because such a lot has been cooked,

00:56:03.900 --> 00:56:05.460
OK?

00:56:06.715 --> 00:56:08.519
Such nice food.

00:56:56.708 --> 00:56:59.199
More than that, ahead of that.

00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:00.720
Dhanya: Play it forward

00:57:01.903 --> 00:57:03.486
Gavin Brown: Yes but tell him.

00:57:03.719 --> 00:57:07.257
Yogi: Is it before this or after this? Gavin: No after, further on.

00:57:11.288 --> 00:57:13.344
Shri Mataji: There’s a nice song

00:57:13.545 --> 00:57:17.260
which says that, in the love of the bhaktas,

00:57:17.577 --> 00:57:19.493
how God

00:57:19.693 --> 00:57:23.117
does little, little things to please the bhaktas.

00:57:24.593 --> 00:57:26.500
And it’s a very good

00:57:26.813 --> 00:57:28.940
thing which you’ll like it very much;

00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:30.620
which were -

00:57:31.796 --> 00:57:34.540
is to be translated and you can…

00:57:38.113 --> 00:57:41.140
You see, this is the one but start it from the. And he says:

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:43.420
God thinks that let my,

00:57:45.027 --> 00:57:47.189
my respect may be less, doesn’t matter

00:57:47.389 --> 00:57:49.140
but I cannot,

00:57:53.144 --> 00:57:57.144
I cannot let down my disciples. I may have to come down

00:57:57.645 --> 00:58:00.411
but I cannot let down my disciples,

00:58:00.612 --> 00:58:02.380
my people who are

00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.363
my bhaktas.

00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:07.540
Just little, just bring it,

00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:09.300
I can’t hear it properly.

00:58:14.030 --> 00:58:16.093
There’s a switch there.

00:58:18.967 --> 00:58:21.220
Begin it again, I’ll tell you meaning.

00:58:24.837 --> 00:58:27.940
Bring it here. It’s a very interesting. Come forward!

00:58:29.104 --> 00:58:32.260
Till they prepare for your food down below.

00:58:32.461 --> 00:58:34.961
You see it will take half an hour at least.

00:58:40.193 --> 00:58:42.420
Come forward! Come! Come here! Come here!

00:58:43.534 --> 00:58:45.860
Today Mr. Shrivastava has become a Sahaj Yogi!

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:49.760
And he now belongs to our Sahaja Nirmala Dharm so it’s all right.

00:58:51.750 --> 00:58:53.250
Sir C.P. Shrivastava: Thank you!

00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.680
Shri Mataji: We have already
registered ourselves as Vishwa Nirmala Dharm!

00:59:11.949 --> 00:59:14.780
Start it, start it from this one.

00:59:24.259 --> 00:59:25.950
Start it earlier.

01:00:19.981 --> 01:00:23.060
Come forward! Come here!

01:00:24.838 --> 01:00:27.180
You can remove this chair!

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:10.100
This is for the devotees of God,

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.153
what He does how far that

01:01:13.353 --> 01:01:15.502
let His respect

01:01:16.133 --> 01:01:17.965
be kept.

01:01:19.627 --> 01:01:23.220
What He does is to give the

01:01:23.976 --> 01:01:27.740
word of the bhaktas;

01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:30.340
not to let down the bhaktas.

01:01:30.540 --> 01:01:34.260
So He comes down to every level,

01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:35.946
just to support,

01:01:36.146 --> 01:01:38.860
just to make them feel happy.

01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:40.620
To every level;

01:01:41.358 --> 01:01:43.615
for His devotees.

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.142
Put a chair also for Mr. Shrivastava there.

01:02:05.342 --> 01:02:07.001
He might come.

01:02:08.158 --> 01:02:10.199
It’s all right, it’s all right, keep it there.

01:02:10.399 --> 01:02:12.900
At the back. Keep it there.

01:02:16.756 --> 01:02:18.860
This is a nice one.

01:02:23.223 --> 01:02:25.060
This is just the

01:02:26.338 --> 01:02:27.845
notes.

01:02:34.066 --> 01:02:37.940
The force of great love of His devotees,

01:02:38.768 --> 01:02:41.740
palay (पलाय)is a word entrapped by that:

01:02:41.940 --> 01:02:43.620
love of the devotees.

01:02:49.857 --> 01:02:52.180
God has to change His laws,

01:02:55.692 --> 01:02:58.257
God has to change His laws,

01:02:59.066 --> 01:03:02.491
in the force of love of God.

01:03:04.892 --> 01:03:06.691
This is Mahamaya!

01:03:09.351 --> 01:03:12.300
God changes His laws with the force

01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:14.780
of the love of His devotees.

01:03:15.939 --> 01:03:18.140
Whether people respect or not,

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.414
whether His respect is challenged or not,

01:03:25.929 --> 01:03:29.220
But the Man of the bhaktas in the respect of the bhaktas

01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:33.100
He knows that he should not be let down.

01:03:33.456 --> 01:03:35.140
Disciples,

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.000
or you can call them the devotees.

01:03:40.053 --> 01:03:43.100
Now he describes how Shri Krishna has done it

01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:45.600
or the God has done it:

01:03:55.442 --> 01:03:58.500
By only a glance of the grace

01:03:59.762 --> 01:04:01.820
the whole universe is

01:04:03.621 --> 01:04:05.900
sustained: means one glance

01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:09.000
of the grace of that God.

01:04:17.061 --> 01:04:20.840
And such a God we have seen Him in Gokul,

01:04:22.508 --> 01:04:24.416
dancing over,

01:04:27.514 --> 01:04:29.820
asking for the butter.

01:04:30.441 --> 01:04:32.630
Just imagine! For Him the whole world

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:35.313
He nourishes, but here it is He is just

01:04:35.514 --> 01:04:37.502
crying for butter, in Gokul,

01:04:37.702 --> 01:04:40.100
just to please His Mother.

01:05:05.363 --> 01:05:07.035
The one whom,

01:05:08.425 --> 01:05:11.897
Shambu is Mahadeva,

01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:15.082
Viranchi is the Brahmadeva.

01:05:15.282 --> 01:05:17.263
All the devas,

01:05:17.464 --> 01:05:20.860
Sanaka is the one, Sanak is the very great, high,

01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:24.287
spiritually evolved personality,

01:05:25.237 --> 01:05:28.620
could not get into meditation towards him,

01:05:30.037 --> 01:05:33.980
and he is playing here with the little boys

01:05:35.002 --> 01:05:37.780
who are ordinary

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:40.755
cowherds.

01:05:43.256 --> 01:05:45.880
See what do you calling them? Cowboys?

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:48.340
The ones that look after, the little, little boys.

01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:50.935
We saw him playing with him there.

01:05:51.136 --> 01:05:53.140
Here the one who cannot

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:55.709
even meditate,

01:05:56.567 --> 01:05:58.994
Viranchi is Brahmadeva,

01:05:59.194 --> 01:06:01.460
Shambu is Mahadeva:

01:06:02.765 --> 01:06:05.740
They cannot even get into meditate:

01:06:06.151 --> 01:06:09.060
Suresh, Ganesh, Mahesh and everybody.

01:06:12.347 --> 01:06:16.189
They think of God but they cannot go beyond.

01:06:18.027 --> 01:06:20.431
But here He is,

01:06:20.632 --> 01:06:23.969
He’s being driven mad

01:06:24.169 --> 01:06:26.679
by a few gopis who have some

01:06:26.879 --> 01:06:29.338
little buttermilk to offer to Him.

01:06:37.311 --> 01:06:39.311
Very good poetry!

01:06:52.421 --> 01:06:54.323
The feet of,

01:06:54.524 --> 01:06:56.540
whose feet are under the,

01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:59.420
under the guidance of Kamala, means the Lakshmi:

01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:02.420
She is the one who is holding His feet while sitting down.

01:07:02.834 --> 01:07:04.900
He can’t get out of it.

01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:13.037
He cannot take out His feet out of Her powers.

01:07:23.821 --> 01:07:26.077
The one who is even looked after

01:07:26.278 --> 01:07:28.222
Shri Lakshmi, you see,

01:07:28.683 --> 01:07:30.580
such a Person,

01:07:45.349 --> 01:07:47.196
such a God,

01:07:47.464 --> 01:07:50.660
have seen His feet walking on the

01:07:54.213 --> 01:07:57.073
thorns of the

01:07:57.958 --> 01:08:01.500
Gokul. Where he was walking there were thorns; in His bare feet,

01:08:01.700 --> 01:08:03.229
He was walking there. Such a God,

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:06.186
who’s feet are pressed even by Shri Lakshmi,

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:11.140
for his bhaktas, because they were all his bhaktas there.

01:08:12.231 --> 01:08:14.380
Like me in London!

01:08:28.257 --> 01:08:31.940
By only a little

01:08:33.273 --> 01:08:35.020
turning of the

01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:38.780
eyebrows, you see little one of His,

01:08:42.086 --> 01:08:45.580
bending of eyebrows, what do you call this type of a thing?

01:08:49.244 --> 01:08:51.420
So seven,

01:08:52.241 --> 01:08:53.992
seven seas

01:08:54.192 --> 01:08:57.192
start boiling, only one is raised.

01:09:00.742 --> 01:09:03.821
Then he describes, Bindu is the poet,

01:09:04.021 --> 01:09:06.700
he describes such a great poet.

01:09:09.469 --> 01:09:11.541
Such a great power

01:09:11.741 --> 01:09:14.060
of God that just lifting one

01:09:15.399 --> 01:09:19.380
eyebrows he makes seven seas to boil.

01:09:21.856 --> 01:09:24.356
Aap aye, aap aye. (Please come, please come).

01:09:29.030 --> 01:09:32.769
There He, with the Mother Yeshoda’s fear,

01:09:33.386 --> 01:09:36.140
He drops the little drops

01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:38.220
of tears.

01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:55.780
Shri Mataji: Bindu's?

01:09:56.325 --> 01:09:57.879
Mr CP Shrivastava: Drops.

01:09:59.822 --> 01:10:03.010
Shri Mataji: His name is also ‘drop’, so he puts it that way.

01:10:05.398 --> 01:10:07.940
From his eyes He drops

01:10:08.843 --> 01:10:10.780
the little, little drops of

01:10:12.589 --> 01:10:14.139
‘bindu’.

01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:19.551
So from where to where? He can make seven

01:10:20.937 --> 01:10:24.580
seas to boil and here, there are tear drops,

01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:28.140
just like bindus from His eyes,

01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:30.980
just to please His Mother.

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.220
Just go and ask Danya, she brought a very good article

01:18:27.037 --> 01:18:29.437
and something from Kahlil Gibran.

01:20:17.535 --> 01:20:19.995
‘Chadariya’ is this body.

01:20:31.299 --> 01:20:34.710
Which he has woven, because was a himself, Kabira,

01:20:34.911 --> 01:20:36.191
was a weaver.

01:20:36.392 --> 01:20:38.380
So he describes weaving;

01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:41.380
that, this body was woven.

01:20:42.962 --> 01:20:45.780
‘Bini’ means woven.

01:21:13.185 --> 01:21:17.185
‘In the name of Rama I have made this body’.

01:21:17.947 --> 01:21:20.747
He was a Ram bhakta.

01:21:22.716 --> 01:21:25.130
Yogi: Do you want us to massage your feet or something?

01:21:26.141 --> 01:21:28.060
Shri Mataji: You can just bring some ice.

01:21:31.752 --> 01:21:35.540
Get one little towel and put some ice

01:21:36.754 --> 01:21:40.515
and then break it, then you have to also rub it with that.

01:21:54.797 --> 01:21:57.688
He says, “This body is a sheath

01:21:59.063 --> 01:22:02.251
in the form of this body.”

01:22:06.045 --> 01:22:08.491
There are eight

01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:12.820
lotuses that is it,

01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:14.635
chakras,

01:22:16.162 --> 01:22:19.496
and five elements.

01:22:20.055 --> 01:22:23.380
Chakka is the one which you spin it,

01:22:24.157 --> 01:22:28.100
made out of eight lotuses, means eight chakras

01:22:29.273 --> 01:22:31.580
and five elements together.

01:22:31.781 --> 01:22:35.140
Then that’s how it was woven

01:22:35.574 --> 01:22:38.660
with nine to ten months.

01:22:43.157 --> 01:22:45.620
But the stupid have spoiled it.

01:23:10.414 --> 01:23:13.100
When my sheet came,

01:23:13.761 --> 01:23:15.720
brought in the house

01:23:17.879 --> 01:23:20.220
- I mean he is describing his guru

01:23:22.021 --> 01:23:24.420
as the person who gives the colour

01:23:24.620 --> 01:23:26.620
to the sheet.

01:24:43.064 --> 01:24:46.340
After wearing this coloured

01:24:49.227 --> 01:24:51.241
sheet, you should not

01:24:51.441 --> 01:24:54.526
get into doubts about the guru.

01:24:54.924 --> 01:24:58.687
The one who has given you the colour, you should not doubt that.

01:25:05.834 --> 01:25:08.318
Don’t think this body is yours.

01:25:10.682 --> 01:25:12.682
The guru has coloured it.

01:25:18.948 --> 01:25:21.380
He’s given you for two days only.

01:25:27.174 --> 01:25:29.151
Should not doubt.

01:25:35.906 --> 01:25:37.503
The stupid,

01:25:37.704 --> 01:25:39.980
those who do not know the secret.

01:25:43.851 --> 01:25:47.300
Every day they go on spoiling this sheet

01:25:48.493 --> 01:25:50.493
– that are stupid!

01:25:56.894 --> 01:25:59.628
Kabira knew only one or two abuses,

01:26:00.242 --> 01:26:02.212
one was ‘stupid’!

01:26:21.593 --> 01:26:23.593
This is Raag Desh.

01:26:23.902 --> 01:26:25.340
He said,

01:26:25.540 --> 01:26:29.540
“Poor Prahlad and Sudama, they also got the same body.”

01:26:37.104 --> 01:26:38.810
Kedar hai.

01:27:31.278 --> 01:27:32.780
All right?

01:27:33.636 --> 01:27:36.002
Are you feeling alright in the hands?

01:27:36.524 --> 01:27:39.087
Mark Beaven: Yes, Mother, little warm.

01:28:01.251 --> 01:28:03.211
Shri Mataji: Gavin?

01:28:04.457 --> 01:28:06.497
This is Malkauns Raag.

01:28:14.617 --> 01:28:17.180
You must send prasad to all the ashrams.

01:28:17.794 --> 01:28:19.340
All right?

01:29:08.189 --> 01:29:10.159
Pay attention here.

01:30:05.525 --> 01:30:08.060
No, no. Paul, just see here.

01:30:30.695 --> 01:30:32.299
Better.

01:33:18.182 --> 01:33:19.682
Eyes also.

01:33:21.057 --> 01:33:23.340
Do it a little bit with the eyes, pressure it.

01:33:35.305 --> 01:33:36.906
See, it’s better.

01:33:37.861 --> 01:33:39.490
Pressure on the eyes.

01:34:58.628 --> 01:35:00.460
Take a bandhan

01:35:00.660 --> 01:35:02.660
and raise your Kundalinis.

01:35:03.336 --> 01:35:05.036
Take a bandhan.

01:35:08.919 --> 01:35:10.585
First take a bandhan I think.

01:35:10.785 --> 01:35:13.501
First take a bandhan then raise the Kundalini.

01:36:28.967 --> 01:36:31.780
Give a bandhan to this house to see people.

01:36:53.304 --> 01:36:55.120
Aah, done!

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:57.040
Now see.

01:36:58.398 --> 01:37:00.232
See on CP’s head also.

01:37:11.304 --> 01:37:12.804
There?

01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:15.617
Tie it up!

01:38:39.608 --> 01:38:41.180
This is the

01:38:41.380 --> 01:38:44.020
song of the Goddess, those who come at the feet

01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:46.128
of you Mother.

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:22.300
“The person who gets place in this world

01:39:22.549 --> 01:39:24.700
the one who comes at your feet.

01:39:31.914 --> 01:39:34.032
This is Saraswati’s bandana.”

01:39:43.401 --> 01:39:45.220
Should we come down?

01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:46.922
Food is ready?

01:39:49.863 --> 01:39:51.963
Accha let’s just finish then.

01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:57.412
“I am completely surrendered. My heart is surrendered,

01:39:57.613 --> 01:40:00.100
my throat is surrendered,

01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:02.127
my voice is surrendered.

01:40:08.554 --> 01:40:10.660
Shraddha is devotion,

01:40:11.422 --> 01:40:14.700
all emotions, everything surrendered to you.“

01:40:20.361 --> 01:40:23.361
Surprising, only to the Mother they ask for blessings.

01:40:31.828 --> 01:40:33.686
This is Saraswati bandhana.

01:41:09.609 --> 01:41:11.980
In India ‘sang’ means

01:41:12.341 --> 01:41:14.460
‘holy’ and ‘geet’ is the ‘music’.

01:41:14.660 --> 01:41:17.900
So the, nothing is higher than holy music,

01:41:19.342 --> 01:41:21.015
divine music.

01:41:37.201 --> 01:41:40.580
“When the ocean of notes starts calling you,

01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:44.460
then Sahaj you fill them up

01:41:44.660 --> 01:41:46.495
with Godliness.”

01:42:07.857 --> 01:42:09.763
“She’s the veena player.

01:42:09.964 --> 01:42:11.991
She gives us the blessings.”

01:42:37.043 --> 01:42:40.044
“Gives eternal music ‘shaswati’ ”

01:42:56.131 --> 01:42:57.977
“And get the new life.

01:42:58.177 --> 01:43:01.100
When you get blessings, one gets the new life.”

01:43:25.619 --> 01:43:29.060
“Sahaja swayam bhagavan mile” “To them, Sahaja,

01:43:30.321 --> 01:43:34.218
God, means sakshat, they see the sakshat of God,

01:43:35.019 --> 01:43:36.691
in person.

01:43:36.892 --> 01:43:38.405
For such people.”

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:40.717
Chalo, let’s go and have food.

01:43:40.917 --> 01:43:44.328
You are the host CP you better call them!
