00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:12.634
Yes, how beautiful they were!
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi about Emile Zola]

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:18.240
Then, he is trying to show in one woman,
four types of womanhood [in the book ‘Nana’].

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:27.943
But [Hindi].

00:00:27.943 --> 00:00:29.960
It’s like that.
Very sublime.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.440
[Hindi].

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:43.600
Must read.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.920
I am rereading something,
it’s important, good things.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:58.000
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t believe
in somebody reading and getting Realisation.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.920
But after Realisation, you must read.
[Hindi].

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:31.708
So many books, one can read.

00:01:31.708 --> 00:01:37.080
These days, I have no time to read.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.433
Grégoire: If they are good you&nbsp;
inspired them all, Shri Mataji.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:44.450
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.500
Grégoire: If they are good you inspired them all.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:57.345
Shri Mataji: It’s true but&nbsp;
– American magnets [unsure],&nbsp;

00:01:57.345 --> 00:01:59.280
they haven’t got much, except for writing.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.993
They just digest these things all right [unsure].

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:07.160
These days, it’s not so bad.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.040
Sometimes you get funny articles in that also.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.080
Also, in between, they want&nbsp;
to popularize themselves&nbsp;

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:24.920
whatever it is, but they have&nbsp;
kept quite a good standard.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.840
Also, apart from that, oratory&nbsp;
and ? point of knowledge,&nbsp;

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.520
must read.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.800
Now let’s seek general knowledge.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.162
What was the name of Abraham Lincoln’s wife?

00:02:47.162 --> 00:02:47.187
Sahaja Yogini: Mary Todd.

00:02:47.187 --> 00:02:50.956
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:50.979
Sahaja Yogi: Mary Todd.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:51.000
Shri Mataji: Correct.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.880
How many knew?

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.760
It was a terrible woman.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.680
Of Abraham Lincoln, you read ‘Unknown’.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.360
It was a very beautiful book. ’Unknown’.
[Hindi: Unknown, do you like?]

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:16.587
Sahaja Yogini: Dji [yes].

00:03:16.587 --> 00:03:29.760
Shri Mataji: How are you?
[Hindi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.320
conversation about Ganapatipule]

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.840
Every Sahaja Yogi must come every year.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:44.280
It’s very nourishing, I think.

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.240
Ganapatipule is very nourishing.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.080
This time, most of you will have to&nbsp;
stay in tents and things like that.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:57.840
Because these people were having very funny –
when we asked them for the holidays, they said,&nbsp;

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.440
“We can give you only few rooms.

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.080
Because there are others who want&nbsp;
to come also during holiday”.

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.680
But holiday suits us better, isn’t it?

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.480
Seven days of holidays or eight days of holidays.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.665
So how are you arranging there, Gavin?

00:04:19.665 --> 00:04:20.947
Sahaja Yogini: For the Tour in India?

00:04:20.947 --> 00:04:24.301
Shri Mataji: Ah.

00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:29.720
Sahaja Yogini: Oh, I haven’t spoken to Lucinia.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.240
All I all I’ve heard, so far,&nbsp;
is that it started on the third&nbsp;

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:40.023
and finishing on this first; 31st or first.

00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:40.040
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.640
You can start it even earlier if you want.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:50.200
You see, because they wanted to&nbsp;
come back, arrive here on the first.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.240
So, when do you want to arrive,&nbsp;
to be able to attend to your work?

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:59.714
When do you start your work here is the point.

00:04:59.714 --> 00:05:03.840
Sahaja Yogi: Usually, the holiday&nbsp;
is between Christmas and New Year.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.795
So, people usually go back&nbsp;
to work after the New Years.

00:05:07.795 --> 00:05:10.504
Shri Mataji: So, second.

00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:14.707
Sahaja Yogi: At any time after the New Year.

00:05:14.707 --> 00:05:29.762
Shri Mataji: So, even if you leave on the 31st,
you’ll be here on 31st.

00:05:29.762 --> 00:05:30.250
The travel is just ?

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.080
The travel is just after, you see.

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.800
So, if you leave on the&nbsp;
31st, you’ll be here on 31st.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.080
Then one day you can rest.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.400
And next, you go for work.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.800
So, you should finish on the 31st.

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:48.400
So, we can start it on first December.

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.656
Sahaja Yogini: As you wish, Shri Mataji.

00:05:48.656 --> 00:05:50.880
Shri Mataji: Shri First of December to 31st.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.160
But Ganapatipule, it could be – Dany, let’s see.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:11.746
Say from twenty- twenty fourth; 24th, 23rd.

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:16.840
Twenty third; 23rd, 24th, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30.

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:24.920
31st you’ll be traveling.
[Hindi]

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.560
Eight days.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.800
All right?

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.720
So, we start on the 22nd.

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:59.520
Ganapatipule, we arrive on 22nd night.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:23.253
[Hindi]

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:39.040
Rajesh appointed a very famous architect.

00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:43.680
Actually, if he had asked me, I&nbsp;
would have said, “Never touch him”.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.880
Because he made a public&nbsp;
building, ministry corporation.

00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:52.640
And to climb up five stores.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:57.706
He made a circular- what you call-

00:07:57.706 --> 00:07:58.140
Sahaja Yogis: Staircases.

00:07:58.140 --> 00:07:59.440
Shri Mataji: Circular staircases.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:07.560
And the people: imagine, at five o’clock,
they are so much in a hurry to go down.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.080
There’s so many&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:15.520
of them who come to the – [Laughter]
little [unclear] you see, and they sit down&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:15.520 --> 00:08:21.304
like monkeys.
[Laughter]

00:08:21.304 --> 00:08:23.177
Sahaja Yogi: It gets down pretty fast.

00:08:23.177 --> 00:08:23.200
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:26.800
You see, Vishal, he is [unsure].

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.440
If there’s a bee, you see, he doesn’t like a bee.

00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:35.240
What it does, it makes the bee&nbsp;
look like a triangle [unsure].

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:37.160
I mean it looks even worse than it.

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.067
Sahaja Yogini: If there is a bee.

00:08:38.067 --> 00:08:39.160
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.160
But what I’ve seen in his house, Rajesh’s house,&nbsp;

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:50.680
that the steps are about seven inches&nbsp;
rice, you know, and five inches foot.

00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.640
I mean, you have to [Laughter].

00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:00.120
And the best part of it, the bed,&nbsp;
he has already made of cement.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:07.980
Sahaja Yogini: Mother is right.

00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:08.000
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.440
“It will not cost anything;&nbsp;
I’ll give you bed step”.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:13.520
“Are baba, remove this cement bits”.

00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:17.160
Your Mother was telling him,&nbsp;
“Baba, I want only white marble”.

00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:18.560
He would not listen.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:23.560
He wants to put white marbles, sandstone, this –
I mean this sandstone, you cannot keep it clean.

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.920
I know what sandstone is.

00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:28.880
And then, the best part of it, he wants to put-&nbsp;

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:32.574
this is the interior decorator&nbsp;
which is another real mad cap.

00:09:32.574 --> 00:09:38.748
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, he is completely crazy.

00:09:38.748 --> 00:09:38.768
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

00:09:38.768 --> 00:09:38.787
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:09:38.787 --> 00:09:40.040
Shri Mataji: You know what he did?

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:44.720
To begin with, he had made&nbsp;
a discotheque first of all,&nbsp;

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:48.745
and he used the WC seats for sitting down.

00:09:48.745 --> 00:09:49.427
Sahaja Yogini: Really?

00:09:49.427 --> 00:09:51.400
Shri Mataji: Ah! Actually, it’s well known.

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.187
Think about it.

00:09:54.187 --> 00:09:55.680
Shri Mataji: Rajesh has [unclear].

00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:59.320
And I know it so well.

00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:05.600
And I asked, Bansury. I said,&nbsp;
“Bansury, why don’t you go?”

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:09.960
She saw my house, she said, “Mother see,&nbsp;
how fast you have built such a big house!”

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.440
I said, “You go yourself”.

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:18.480
She said, “What. I go there but, he is&nbsp;
planning for the last six months, [unclear].

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:19.680
Every day, he draws.

00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.280
Then there is a pile of papers.

00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.459
But he doesn’t like it. [unsure].

00:10:23.459 --> 00:10:24.560
He says, “No good, no good no good”.

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:27.760
So, what is there to plan [unclear]?”

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:32.040
I said, “Just get it and put it there”.

00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:44.520
I can’t understand.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:45.560
I’ve built this house.

00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:58.240
So, it’s such a big house, in such a short time.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:02.520
But when I went there, he ran away. Thank God.

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:24.524
I don’t know, he got some work&nbsp;
and he run away, thank God.

00:11:24.524 --> 00:11:24.579
Sahaja Yogini: I went last&nbsp;
week, but things are moving.

00:11:24.579 --> 00:11:24.596
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:11:24.596 --> 00:11:24.619
Sahaja Yogini: [Hindi].

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:24.640
Shri Mataji: [Hindi].

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.880
First, I didn’t want to go to that house.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:29.320
I told Rajesh I’ll go, but&nbsp;
then, if I say anything,&nbsp;

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:29.840
you shouldn’t mind.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:32.520
“No, no. I want you to come and see”.

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:45.040
I said, “What is this?”

00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:47.800
And then you tell him that I don’t want that,
“I don’t want this thing.

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.760
“This is all right. You go ahead. You do it”.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:53.000
Now halfway, poor Rajesh has no time.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:59.427
It’s some blackmail, absolutely.
[Hindi conversation.]

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:13.060
Bahut [really], it’s not a normal person.

00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:17.374
He looks pour [unclear], womanish,&nbsp;
ne [isn’t it], feminine birth.

00:12:17.374 --> 00:12:17.385
Effeminate.

00:12:17.385 --> 00:12:30.313
Sahaja Yogini: Jai Shri Mataji,&nbsp;
mister C/P/ is on the telephone.

00:12:30.313 --> 00:12:30.349
Shri Mataji: Where is it, the phone?

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:34.206
Grégoire: You would like to take it in your room?

00:12:34.206 --> 00:12:34.229
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:12:34.229 --> 00:12:35.160
Grégoire: OK

00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:36.240
Who else is there?

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:54.413
Did you meet Shri Mataji yet? No.
[Inaudible whispers.]

00:12:54.413 --> 00:12:55.284
And? Dattatreya would you- this is for me?

00:12:55.284 --> 00:12:57.947
Sahaja Yogini: This is for&nbsp;
you from Andrew from Main.

00:12:57.947 --> 00:12:58.105
Shri Mataji: From?

00:12:58.105 --> 00:13:00.280
Sahaja Yogini: From Main. It’s north&nbsp;
of Boston, two hours from here.

00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.427
We have a small center here.

00:13:01.427 --> 00:13:02.200
Shri Mataji: I see.

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.054
So, you’re starting a center there.

00:13:06.054 --> 00:13:09.627
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, Craig and Georgia&nbsp;
started a center in Portland and Maine.

00:13:09.627 --> 00:13:10.505
Shri Mataji: You and who?

00:13:10.505 --> 00:13:11.145
Sahaja Yogini: Her husband.

00:13:11.145 --> 00:13:13.525
Sahaja Yogini: My husband Craig.

00:13:13.525 --> 00:13:13.557
Shri Mataji: ‘Atcha’, Craig.

00:13:13.557 --> 00:13:19.397
So you started- who is Craig?

00:13:19.397 --> 00:13:19.420
Gregoire: Who is Craig?

00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:19.467
Sahaja Yogini: She had to go down with Harriet.

00:13:19.467 --> 00:13:20.920
Shri Mataji: So, you started this one.

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:22.100
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:29.560
Shri Mataji: It’s good. Eyes are just [laughter].

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:33.747
Beautiful. May God bless you.

00:13:33.747 --> 00:13:37.880
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, this is&nbsp;
Henry [Faye ? Unclear] from Colorado.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:45.187
He’s the only Sahaja Yogi in Colorado&nbsp;
as far as we know right now. [Laughter]

00:13:45.187 --> 00:13:48.840
Shri Mataji: I remember being&nbsp;
there, in Colorado, I must go.

00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:55.400
You see, there are lots of seekers in Colorado,
but they are lost people, quite a lot.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.520
This fellow, what’s his&nbsp;
name? Is this uh Ananda Mark?

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.800
People have quite a lot there,&nbsp;
in Colorado. You know them?

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.945
Have you heard about them?

00:14:06.945 --> 00:14:09.987
Sahaja Yogini: Ananda Mark …

00:14:09.987 --> 00:14:17.280
Shri Mataji: Those who were sort of banged,
they used to murder people.

00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.400
Because, one was mister doctor Prasad&nbsp;
who was working for this [name unclear],&nbsp;

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.680
he has lived/been in Colorado, so&nbsp;
there are lots of seeker all there.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:29.480
You should send him that.

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:37.353
Gregoire: For your Vanessa&nbsp;
program in Colorado? [Laughter]

00:14:37.353 --> 00:14:40.760
Henry: There’s a very beautiful place in&nbsp;
Colorado Springs called Colorado Garden.

00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:44.200
Shri Mataji: How did you come to&nbsp;
Sahaja Yoga, when did you come?

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:49.120
Henry: Through digital. I read&nbsp;
and noticed there Phil Ward.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:54.200
Sahaja Yogi: Yes. He saw Phillip Ward has been&nbsp;
putting announcements in the computer network.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:58.240
And Henry saw this, and then we’ve been&nbsp;
communicating through actually computers,&nbsp;

00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:01.620
and then we sent him a photograph and he came to –

00:15:01.620 --> 00:15:11.523
Shri Mataji: Sahaja yoga is on&nbsp;
the computer now? [Laughter]

00:15:11.523 --> 00:15:11.547
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, it is.

00:15:11.547 --> 00:15:14.220
Shri Mataji: How do you put it on the company?

00:15:14.220 --> 00:15:19.480
Gregoire: Phil Ward should explain, I think.

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:19.496
Shri Mataji: Yes

00:15:19.496 --> 00:15:21.360
Phil Ward: Shri Mataji, on this computer network,&nbsp;

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:25.440
it’s accessible to about 100 000&nbsp;
people who work for the company.

00:15:25.440 --> 00:15:29.920
So, I wrote a little article&nbsp;
describing Sahaja Yoga it said,&nbsp;

00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.160
“If you would like to know more, let me know&nbsp;

00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:37.227
and I’ll send you Shri Mataji’s&nbsp;
photograph and samples of meditation.

00:15:37.227 --> 00:15:38.949
Shri Mataji: But where did you write this article?

00:15:38.949 --> 00:15:41.600
Phil Ward: I just, I was&nbsp;
sitting in Nibe [name unsure]&nbsp;

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.240
because I wrote it on the computer, that’s&nbsp;
somewhere in New England, somewhere.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:47.389
Shri Mataji: Hum. I see, I see.

00:15:47.389 --> 00:15:54.649
Phil Ward: And so far, about 30&nbsp;
people have written. All told and –

00:15:54.649 --> 00:15:54.669
Shri Mataji: Really?

00:15:54.669 --> 00:16:00.947
Phil Ward: And about now three of them –
there’s also Paulo the Chinese fellow.

00:16:00.947 --> 00:16:04.127
Sahaja Yogi: He met you in San Diego.

00:16:04.127 --> 00:16:04.149
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes.

00:16:04.149 --> 00:16:04.960
Phil Ward: He came that way.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.120
And there’s also a girl near&nbsp;
San Francisco, called Helene,&nbsp;

00:16:09.120 --> 00:16:11.067
but she wasn’t able to come this weekend

00:16:11.067 --> 00:16:13.600
Shri Mataji: That’s a good and subtle way,&nbsp;

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:19.280
very subtle, isn’t it? Very good.
[Laughter]

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:24.709
But on a general one, on a general&nbsp;
computer or, where did you put it?

00:16:24.709 --> 00:16:28.480
Phil Ward: Well, it’s in a file that’s&nbsp;
accessible to anybody on the network.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:31.160
They are different, they’re called conferences,&nbsp;

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:34.280
and there are different conferences&nbsp;
devoted to different subjects.

00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:41.000
And this particular one is where all the&nbsp;
seekers write about their experiences.

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.280
And so, there’s all sorts of rubbish in there.
[Laughter]

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.023
But at the same time, this&nbsp;
is where the seekers come so.

00:16:51.023 --> 00:16:53.240
Shri Mataji: You see, there&nbsp;
was a suggestion recently,&nbsp;

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.760
that there should be a now a book&nbsp;
written about me and the miracles.

00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.160
And the miraculous photographs&nbsp;
should be put there.

00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:06.120
That is the best way to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.749
What do you say to that?

00:17:07.749 --> 00:17:12.507
Phil Ward: It would be great, Shri Mataji.

00:17:12.507 --> 00:17:25.012
Shri Mataji: So, I think I’ll&nbsp;
have to ask you to do that.&nbsp;

00:17:25.012 --> 00:17:25.040
Because [Laughter]
[Applause]

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.720
You have seen these photographs, have you?

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:28.840
These are really miraculous.

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.680
These are the photographs I’m sitting here
and all the Devis, Devdas are sitting&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:47.560
around.
[Hindi]

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:51.260
Here you can also see the angels with their wings.

00:17:51.260 --> 00:17:52.612
You’ve seen Mark? Not yet?

00:17:52.612 --> 00:17:52.640
You haven’t seen this one?

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:59.573
Mark: No.

00:17:59.573 --> 00:18:04.462
Shri Mataji: [Hindi]

00:18:04.462 --> 00:18:05.760
Ah! That one!

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:14.040
You show that one also:&nbsp;
angels, all the angels there.

00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.560
This is that ‘anther&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:21.840
pattern’ [unsure], you see, between the –
they hold the cloth, that one is here.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.760
And just see the arrows that these&nbsp;
deities are sending in the marriages.

00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:32.305
This is when you people got married.

00:18:32.305 --> 00:18:32.827
Sahaja Yogini: Oh, oh!

00:18:32.827 --> 00:18:47.560
Shri Mataji: That time.

00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:52.120
See the boys having vibrations&nbsp;
on top of their heads.

00:18:52.120 --> 00:18:55.120
There’s one is missing, where&nbsp;
all the Sahaja Yogis are sitting;&nbsp;

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.640
on top of their heads is the light.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:19:06.040
And if you read it from this side,&nbsp;
in Arabic language, it is Allah.

00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.040
And from the other side it is Nirmala.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.707
All Sahaja Yogis: Ah!

00:19:10.707 --> 00:19:18.840
Shri Mataji: In Arabic language. Very interesting.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:25.580
This is me looking like a Kumbha&nbsp;
and all the vibrations there.

00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:31.200
And this is the girls, you see,&nbsp;
when they were getting married.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:46.622
All the flowers falling on them. The wild flowers

00:19:46.622 --> 00:19:46.660
Sahaja Yogini: Shri Mataji, it’s me.

00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:58.880
Shri Mataji: It’s there?
[Hindi conversation]&nbsp;

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.000
[Laughter]

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.920
See now! So, how important are your marriages
that all the deities were putting flowers on you.

00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:09.360
And this one is – see now, understand that.

00:20:09.360 --> 00:20:10.920
This one is where&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:20:10.920 --> 00:20:18.280
he was holding that ‘anther pattern’ [unsure],
so she is Shri chakra and all the flowers falling.

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.240
And the Shri chakra.

00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:29.600
The girls are here on this side.
[Hindi]

00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:33.920
Who else is has not met me?

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:40.827
Gregoire: Anyone has.

00:20:40.827 --> 00:20:45.570
Sahaja Yogi: This is Lynn from&nbsp;
Cincinnati, Mother. Her name is Lynn.

00:20:45.570 --> 00:20:45.587
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:20:45.587 --> 00:20:47.787
Sahaja Yogi: Her name is&nbsp;
Lynn. She’s from Cincinnati.

00:20:47.787 --> 00:20:52.760
Shri Mataji: Cincinnati. Yes.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:57.920
So slowly, slowly, we are spreading everywhere.

00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.800
Sahaja Yoga cannot grow very fast,&nbsp;

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:08.480
because the speed is in proportion to&nbsp;
how many people there are to balance.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.480
And if you get thousands how will you manage them?

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:14.160
Because you have to make something out of them.

00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:28.520
They have to become something.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.760
And these photos were taken&nbsp;
by a very ordinary boy,&nbsp;

00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:43.120
who is a first-year medical student.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.720
He says, “I’ve never handled much of camera”.

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.840
And the cameras, you see, these people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:47.840 --> 00:21:51.680
brought as present to him,
ordinary camera, from that.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.480
And he said, “Mother, what has come out of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:56.080
my camera?”
[Laughter]

00:21:56.080 --> 00:21:58.520
He was quite frightened, you know, to see this.

00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:14.800
You didn’t tell her name. Lynn, Lynn is her name?

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.499
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:22:17.499 --> 00:22:17.643
Shri Mataji: [Hindi] I should know about this.

00:22:17.643 --> 00:22:18.345
Gregoire: So, they have something to ask.

00:22:18.345 --> 00:22:20.480
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, I wanted to&nbsp;
ask you what would be the best thing&nbsp;

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:23.920
to do with my daughter Sydney as far as schooling.

00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:26.000
We had – I had written to Anne-Laure&nbsp;

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.800
to see if it would be possible for&nbsp;
her to go to school in Switzerland.

00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.145
Shri Mataji: How old is she?

00:22:31.145 --> 00:22:34.903
Sahaja Yogini: She’s just turned six. She&nbsp;
finished kindergarten here in America.

00:22:34.903 --> 00:22:36.800
Shri Mataji: So, she can easily.&nbsp;
But they haven’t started.

00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.160
They’ll be starting in I think,&nbsp;
in September or something.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.280
Oh that’s all right. They are going to start now.

00:22:43.280 --> 00:22:48.000
They have lots of people this&nbsp;
time, pupils, I should say.

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:52.000
And that would be nice if she’ in that school.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.745
And you, actually, come from&nbsp;
Switzerland in any case so.

00:22:54.745 --> 00:22:57.787
Sahaja Yogini: My mother lives in&nbsp;
France, very close to Switzerland.

00:22:57.787 --> 00:22:59.356
Shri Mataji: But your father&nbsp;
was from Switzerland, wasn’t he?

00:22:59.356 --> 00:23:02.160
Sahaja Yogini: He was Norwegian my father.

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:06.063
But he worked at the United Nations&nbsp;
in Geneva for many, many years.

00:23:06.063 --> 00:23:07.520
Shri Mataji: Oh, that’s how.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.145
Sahaja Yogini: Yes.

00:23:08.145 --> 00:23:09.960
Shri Mataji: A Norwegian.

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.705
What about Norway? What do you think?

00:23:12.705 --> 00:23:15.267
Sahaja Yogini: My sister is&nbsp;
there. She is meditating.

00:23:15.267 --> 00:23:18.120
Shri Mataji: What does she say about the people?

00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:20.320
They are the only three&nbsp;
countries we have no feed-back,&nbsp;

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:24.067
this Norway, Denmark and which one is the?

00:23:24.067 --> 00:23:24.467
Sahaja Yogi: Sweden.

00:23:24.467 --> 00:23:27.200
Shri Mataji: Sweden. Norway.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:30.305
They have a funny type of socialism there.

00:23:30.305 --> 00:23:32.667
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, I lived there for 10 years.

00:23:32.667 --> 00:23:33.185
Shri Mataji: Where?

00:23:33.185 --> 00:23:34.307
Sahaja Yogini: Norway.

00:23:34.307 --> 00:23:35.065
Shri Mataji: Really?

00:23:35.065 --> 00:23:38.280
Sahaja Yogini: Yes. I know&nbsp;
the country is very rich&nbsp;

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:44.067
and the language and the&nbsp;
people love you indirectly.

00:23:44.067 --> 00:23:44.139
Shri Mataji: Indirectly.

00:23:44.139 --> 00:23:46.120
Sahaja Yogini: Cause they love the nature.

00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.040
But they know nothing of religion.

00:23:49.040 --> 00:23:51.747
They have rejected their own state religion.

00:23:51.747 --> 00:23:52.785
Shri Mataji: They have no religion?

00:23:52.785 --> 00:23:55.640
Sahaja Yogini: They don’t, they&nbsp;
have a state church, ritualism,&nbsp;

00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.760
but no one goes.

00:23:56.760 --> 00:24:01.480
They go into the hills to hike and to ski.

00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:05.960
And they go alone, they don’t go&nbsp;
with groups. They go by themselves.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.360
And they [unclear] peaceful but repressed.

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:15.680
The family is very important,&nbsp;
the woman is important.

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:24.307
But the socialism is a fraud?
It’s not quite what they publicize.

00:24:24.307 --> 00:24:28.360
Shri Mataji: It’s so funny they have a socialism.

00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:37.680
Because, see how it will work out there.

00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:41.880
I met some people, some&nbsp;
young people, but they said,&nbsp;

00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:50.840
“The young people here are,&nbsp;
more sort of business like”.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:54.465
They want to have motorcycles, and-

00:24:54.465 --> 00:24:55.880
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, they become wealthy.

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:58.520
They found oil in the North Sea.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.240
And prior to that, they weren’t like that.

00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:03.560
I have a Norwegian son and he is a seeker.

00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:08.787
He has not come to Sahaja Yoga yet,
and he said that those who seek are persecuted.

00:25:08.787 --> 00:25:09.385
Shri Mataji: Those who?

00:25:09.385 --> 00:25:13.840
Sahaja Yogini: Those who seek, the young who seek
are persecuted by those who do not seek,&nbsp;

00:25:13.840 --> 00:25:16.227
and that they have to suffer.

00:25:16.227 --> 00:25:17.785
Shri Mataji: So, they don’t want to see.

00:25:17.785 --> 00:25:22.600
Sahaja Yogini: No. Those who do seek
are persecuted by the youth who do not seek.

00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.400
And so, they don’t stop&nbsp;
seeking, but they have to do it&nbsp;

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.520
more or less secretly, or be by themselves.

00:25:28.520 --> 00:25:35.067
Because they have an animosity towards seekers.

00:25:35.067 --> 00:25:36.705
Shri Mataji: I mean, the young people.

00:25:36.705 --> 00:25:40.920
Sahaja Yogini: Yes it’s like two cults,
one is seekers and non-seekers&nbsp;

00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:45.280
and there are very few who&nbsp;
are seriously seeking God.

00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.458
And they have got caught in drugs.
So, there is that problem too.

00:25:50.458 --> 00:25:52.200
Second Sahaja Yogini: There’s&nbsp;
a lot of drinking in Norway.

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:58.240
They drink very much, very excessively.

00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.641
But despite all that, they’re wonderful people.

00:26:08.641 --> 00:26:08.658
Shri Mataji: Hum?

00:26:08.658 --> 00:26:09.867
Second Sahaja Yogini: They’re wonderful people.

00:26:09.867 --> 00:26:10.858
Shri Mataji: They’re simple.

00:26:10.858 --> 00:26:19.427
Second Sahaja Yogini: Yes.&nbsp;
They’re sweet. They’re wonderful

00:26:19.427 --> 00:26:21.440
Shri Mataji: I don’t know that.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:26.560
Now Greece is over, we are in Greece,
we have got 500 people meditating.

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:31.320
But these three countries,&nbsp;
if you can manage somehow.

00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:34.860
They should not say that, “You&nbsp;
never did anything for us”.

00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.880
We have to look after [unsure].

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:44.120
As now, with this Colombia, I think&nbsp;
we can go to Bolivia, Peru, all that.

00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:48.780
Even Argentina and say, Chili.

00:26:48.780 --> 00:26:54.040
But I don’t know about the rest&nbsp;
of it, how will you manage.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:58.280
Because these three countries are really –&nbsp;

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:05.040
I think they’re quite superficial type&nbsp;
of people: day-to-day living entirely.

00:27:05.040 --> 00:27:10.880
Finland is better. Finland people,&nbsp;
because they are farmers, you see.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:17.840
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, may I ask&nbsp;
you how was the situation in Brazil?&nbsp;

00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.320
I heard that they have started Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:21.947
Shri Mataji: Brazil?

00:27:21.947 --> 00:27:22.800
Sahaja Yogi: Brazil.

00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:28.160
Sahaja Yogini: In the north of&nbsp;
Brazil, I heard they started Sahaja.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.030
Shri Mataji: Now this boy who is –

00:27:30.030 --> 00:27:31.462
Gregoire: Duilio.

00:27:31.462 --> 00:27:31.482
Shri Mataji: Duilio.

00:27:31.482 --> 00:27:31.507
Gregoire: He’s Italian.

00:27:31.507 --> 00:27:34.265
Shri Mataji: Does she know about that?

00:27:34.265 --> 00:27:40.174
Sahaja Yogini: No, because I’m from&nbsp;
Brazil, this is why I am interested.

00:27:40.174 --> 00:27:45.683
Shri Mataji: This fellow, Duilio is&nbsp;
starting an ashram very near the seashore.

00:27:45.683 --> 00:27:45.707
Sahaja Yogini: Salvador.

00:27:45.707 --> 00:27:47.640
Shri Mataji: Salvador.

00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.920
And he has a very plan. I saw,&nbsp;
gave him the design of the ashram.

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.440
And he got a beautiful thing.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.800
And he is in architecture.

00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:04.480
So he and his wife both are&nbsp;
going to start an ashram there.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:09.280
It’s beautifully designed. It’s very&nbsp;
good, but let’s see if it works out.

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.625
He has bought a land there.

00:28:12.625 --> 00:28:17.006
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, my&nbsp;
daughter and I we are from Brazil.

00:28:17.006 --> 00:28:17.025
Shri Mataji: I see.

00:28:17.025 --> 00:28:25.547
Sahaja Yogini: And we would like to know&nbsp;
whether you would like us to [28:21; no sound]

00:28:25.547 --> 00:28:29.880
Shri Mataji: Brazil is a nice&nbsp;
place, I mean, we can do a lot.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:36.320
Let’s see with this thing, what happens, maybe.

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:38.040
Sahaja Yogini: Mother, if&nbsp;
you permit me to ask you, we&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.320
have met you [unclear],
my mother and I met you-

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:39.345
Shri Mataji: Yes, I know.

00:28:39.345 --> 00:28:41.040
Sahaja Yogini: And you saw my son.

00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:45.520
I wanted to know if you thought and advice,
or if I live him for a period of time in Rome,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:48.663
to help him.

00:28:48.663 --> 00:28:49.500
Shri Mataji: In, you mean, Brazil.

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:52.880
Sahaja Yogini: No, no. Rome,&nbsp;
my son, by himself, in Rome.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.305
Shri Mataji: In Rome.

00:28:53.305 --> 00:28:53.960
Sahaja Yogini: Do you think that would be wise?

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.385
Shri Mataji: Yes, it’s wise.

00:28:56.385 --> 00:28:59.040
Sahaja Yogini: And we’ll be there until this.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:04.040
He’s much better since you’re with him.

00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:09.787
He’s now himself so much calmer.

00:29:09.787 --> 00:29:12.400
Shri Mataji: Yes, that should be nice.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:18.760
That’s a very good school in Rome.

00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:26.360
Yes. We had a plan to build the&nbsp;
school and an ashram in Rome.

00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:29.040
And we bought a lot of land also.

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:34.680
I borrowed about 100 000 to buy that plot.

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:37.600
But it turned out to be very far away.

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.596
So, then everybody said, “It’s&nbsp;
going to be very far away, Mother “.

00:29:41.596 --> 00:29:45.520
So, we are now selling out that plot.

00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:48.760
And we are thinking of buying another place now.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:53.800
We have to start a children’s&nbsp;
school, small children.

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:58.440
And also for people to live there.

00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:01.480
So, they’re trying to find out some place.

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.160
Just now, it’s all right for a&nbsp;
year or so, this school is there.

00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:12.720
But they esteem that we, all Sahaja Yogis,
should contribute about a hundred pounds per year.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:14.120
It’s not much.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:16.320
Hundred pounds per year is not much.

00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:22.160
If you all contribute, it can&nbsp;
provide for so many things&nbsp;

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.680
like schools, ashrams, this.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:28.880
Now the first lot has to go to Vaitarna school
because that is imminent.

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:31.360
Immediately, we must start working on that.

00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.960
It will take about two or three years;
by that time, we should be ready to go.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:37.880
So, Vaitarna school is the&nbsp;
first thing I’m going to do.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.480
But then, every year we’ll have this money.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:44.040
And now, as Sahaja Yogis are&nbsp;
growing, see, we’ll have this money.

00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:47.560
With this money, we can always do&nbsp;
all these things as you were saying,&nbsp;

00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:49.680
that in Rome, we can have a proper school.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:57.920
Or we can have also an ashram,&nbsp;
say, in different places.

00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:03.160
Gregoire: Shri Mataji,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:11.133
perhaps, before you have your bus,
can we take your mantra to welcome you?

00:31:11.133 --> 00:31:11.150
Shri Mataji: Yes.

00:31:11.150 --> 00:31:16.760
Gregoire: Let us, by taking the mantra,&nbsp;
ask Shri Ganesha to remove all obstacles&nbsp;

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:27.920
and to call the seekers to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:57.840
Shri&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:28.200
Mataji’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.760
lotus&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:57.720
feet.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:11.040
[Mantra to Shri Ganesha]

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.614
[Mantra to Hamsa Swamini]

00:34:11.614 --> 00:34:11.640
[Mantras of the Sahasrara]

00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:28.720
Shri Mataji: May&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:34:34.440 --> 00:34:36.236
God bless you all.

00:34:36.236 --> 00:34:36.258
May God bless you all.

00:34:36.258 --> 00:34:36.280
May God bless you all.

00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.840
Everybody has a beautiful, beautiful Kundalini.

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:51.451
Now ask them if they can enlarge it.

00:34:51.451 --> 00:34:51.510
I’m going to Guru Puja if you&nbsp;
can get them to enlarge it.

00:34:51.510 --> 00:34:59.520
Gregoire: I thought you were speaking&nbsp;
about the Kundalini. [Laughter]

00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:01.680
You said, “Ask them whether they can enlarge it”.

00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:13.907
I thought you were meaning our Kundalinis.
[Laughter]

00:35:13.907 --> 00:35:16.195
Shri Mataji: Actually,&nbsp;
enlargement is not being there.

00:35:16.195 --> 00:35:20.560
They are spreading because,&nbsp;
you see, height is the same.

00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:22.149
Spreading is the point.

00:35:22.149 --> 00:35:26.400
You should spread it on the left and right side.

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.800
The light should be more&nbsp;
on the left and right side.

00:35:29.800 --> 00:35:37.166
Just ask these people if you can do something.

00:35:37.166 --> 00:35:37.183
Sahaja Yogi: Yes.

00:35:37.183 --> 00:35:39.347
Shri Mataji: So, thank you very much

00:35:39.347 --> 00:35:40.024
Sahaja Yogi: Thank you Shri Mataji.

00:35:40.024 --> 00:35:57.640
Gregoire: Thank you Shri Mataji for being here.

00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:57.520
[Hindi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:26.640
conversation]

00:37:30.267 --> 00:37:30.937
Sahaja Yogi: Dji [Yes]. He comes to&nbsp;
all the programs. Jai Shri Mataji

00:37:30.937 --> 00:37:57.440
Shri Mataji: [Hindi] : May&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:19.720
God bless you.

00:38:19.720 --> 00:38:20.507
[Shri Mataji leaves the room]

00:38:20.507 --> 00:38:20.560
Gregoire [to Sahaja Yogis&nbsp;
who are leaving the house]:&nbsp;

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:29.880
Very nice to see you. We’ll meet again.

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:36.760
We meet again this evening at the program.

00:38:38.080 --> 00:38:40.800
I think there is one car with Phil.

00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.800
Phil with whom are you?

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.660
Phil: I’m using the van.

00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:48.080
Gregoire: You are in the van.&nbsp;
How many cars do we have?

00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:52.460
So, you can hang around here and Steve too.

00:38:52.460 --> 00:38:54.400
But, I mean, basically,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:38:54.960 --> 00:39:23.040
you know, the house has to be quiet,
because Shri Mataji has to rest.
