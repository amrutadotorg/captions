00:24:52.544 --> 00:24:58.654
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:25:02.704 --> 00:25:06.239
As I told you yesterday,

00:25:07.397 --> 00:25:11.264
that truth is what it is.

00:25:11.465 --> 00:25:17.676
We cannot understand it,

00:25:18.041 --> 00:25:20.504
you have to feel it.

00:25:21.614 --> 00:25:25.044
We cannot conceptualize it,

00:25:25.254 --> 00:25:28.714
and you cannot feel it also

00:25:28.914 --> 00:25:32.366
at this human awareness.

00:25:34.824 --> 00:25:38.104
We have to become a subtler being,

00:25:38.364 --> 00:25:40.784
as described in all the Scriptures,

00:25:40.994 --> 00:25:43.964
that you are to be born again

00:25:44.174 --> 00:25:47.884
and that you have to become the Spirit,

00:25:48.104 --> 00:25:54.719
to feel the existence of Truth.

00:25:58.974 --> 00:26:04.033
First thing, we have to understand,

00:26:04.234 --> 00:26:07.485
that all this is a process

00:26:07.685 --> 00:26:10.693
of a living energy.

00:26:11.834 --> 00:26:15.384
Divine is a living energy,

00:26:15.624 --> 00:26:21.414
and divinity within you also is a living energy.

00:26:21.654 --> 00:26:28.084
We do not understand sometimes what is a living energy.

00:26:29.279 --> 00:26:33.619
When we sow a seed in the ground,

00:26:33.819 --> 00:26:37.133
they sprout by themselves.

00:26:37.334 --> 00:26:41.574
When a mother conceives the child,

00:26:41.775 --> 00:26:46.391
according to the normal nature of human beings,

00:26:46.592 --> 00:26:52.148
their body has to expel everything that is foreign.

00:26:52.349 --> 00:26:54.959
But when the child is conceived,

00:26:55.159 --> 00:26:59.293
it is not only kept in the body

00:26:59.494 --> 00:27:02.084
but is nourished, looked after, developed,

00:27:02.284 --> 00:27:06.214
and at the right time it is expelled.

00:27:08.824 --> 00:27:12.374
There are so many other things which cannot be explained

00:27:12.614 --> 00:27:15.414
through medical science.

00:27:17.324 --> 00:27:23.277
But one must know that to understand what I am saying,

00:27:23.984 --> 00:27:26.858
you must have an open mind,

00:27:27.058 --> 00:27:29.605
like a scientist has.

00:27:30.214 --> 00:27:32.975
And if you find what I am saying,

00:27:33.175 --> 00:27:36.723
which is like a hypothesis,

00:27:36.924 --> 00:27:42.204
is true and gives you the experience of the truth,

00:27:42.444 --> 00:27:45.566
then as honest people you must accept it,

00:27:45.789 --> 00:27:50.134
because it is for your emancipation

00:27:50.334 --> 00:27:54.161
and for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:27:55.064 --> 00:27:59.600
In our evolutionary process now we have become human beings,

00:27:59.801 --> 00:28:03.614
but as you know we have not achieved the absoluteness.

00:28:03.874 --> 00:28:08.054
For that something has to happen within us:

00:28:09.844 --> 00:28:13.074
the last breakthrough has to take place,

00:28:13.346 --> 00:28:18.478
and that is what we are talking about here.

00:28:19.404 --> 00:28:24.014
You have been already told about the mechanism that is here.

00:28:24.684 --> 00:28:28.003
And this mechanism exists within you,

00:28:28.204 --> 00:28:32.153
these two lines that you see, left and right,

00:28:32.354 --> 00:28:37.894
are nourishing our left and right sympathetic nervous system.

00:28:38.344 --> 00:28:41.644
And the central one that you see here

00:28:41.934 --> 00:28:46.767
is nourishing our parasympathetic nervous system.

00:28:47.886 --> 00:28:53.723
Now these centers are

00:28:53.924 --> 00:28:57.560
created by these two sides,

00:28:57.798 --> 00:29:01.248
left and the right like this in the center,

00:29:02.224 --> 00:29:04.584
and these centers

00:29:04.824 --> 00:29:09.373
are all the time exhausted by us

00:29:09.574 --> 00:29:13.464
whenever we try to use energy.

00:29:14.494 --> 00:29:17.004
For example, if you are running fast

00:29:17.204 --> 00:29:20.170
you can increase the heart rate,

00:29:20.371 --> 00:29:23.294
but it comes to its normal self

00:29:23.544 --> 00:29:26.204
through the parasympathetic nervous system,

00:29:26.414 --> 00:29:30.630
while in emergency you use your sympathetic nervous system.

00:29:31.336 --> 00:29:36.773
Thus, we start exhausting the energy of these centers,

00:29:36.974 --> 00:29:40.393
and that’s how we get into problems

00:29:40.594 --> 00:29:45.609
of our physical, mental and emotional being.

00:29:46.764 --> 00:29:49.879
Supposing we are exhausting the energy on the right-hand side

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:51.484
means you are very futuristic,

00:29:51.684 --> 00:29:54.484
you are planning all the time, thinking of the future

00:29:54.764 --> 00:29:57.784
then what happens, the right side starts moving like this.

00:29:58.034 --> 00:30:02.053
And something happens on the left side, a shock, then it breaks.

00:30:02.254 --> 00:30:06.044
When it breaks, then we lose our connection

00:30:06.244 --> 00:30:08.384
with the central nervous system;

00:30:08.678 --> 00:30:11.641
that means we lose our connection with our brain that controls it

00:30:11.842 --> 00:30:13.604
and we become on our own.

00:30:13.804 --> 00:30:17.813
And that’s how psychosomatic troubles start, specially cancer,

00:30:18.014 --> 00:30:20.374
and the malignancy sets in.

00:30:21.144 --> 00:30:24.223
When the Kundalini rises from there,

00:30:24.424 --> 00:30:28.093
She goes through this center as well as this center,

00:30:28.294 --> 00:30:31.574
pushes them together and nourishes them.

00:30:32.294 --> 00:30:34.523
Now let us see

00:30:34.724 --> 00:30:38.533
what is the quality of all these centers within us.

00:30:38.734 --> 00:30:41.384
This is all within us, and we have to see

00:30:41.624 --> 00:30:46.493
that how we exist with the energy of these centers.

00:30:46.694 --> 00:30:51.564
The first center that you see is down below.

00:30:52.524 --> 00:30:55.119
This center which is down below,

00:30:55.319 --> 00:30:57.653
is below the Kundalini,

00:30:57.854 --> 00:31:02.063
and so we have to understand that

00:31:02.264 --> 00:31:07.184
this center supports the rising of the Kundalini,

00:31:07.385 --> 00:31:10.654
but it's not pierced through by the Kundalini.

00:31:11.214 --> 00:31:13.684
This center is

00:31:13.894 --> 00:31:17.906
for all our excretion,

00:31:18.107 --> 00:31:19.784
even sex.

00:31:19.984 --> 00:31:22.764
So those people who say that through sex

00:31:22.964 --> 00:31:24.654
you can raise your Kundalini,

00:31:24.855 --> 00:31:28.603
they are absolutely wrong and are misleading you.

00:31:28.804 --> 00:31:32.323
Because you can see here clearly, it is below that.

00:31:32.524 --> 00:31:35.784
This is the center of innocence,

00:31:36.374 --> 00:31:38.000
is the center

00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:41.083
where we say that the deity of innocence is sitting here,

00:31:41.284 --> 00:31:44.324
who incarnated later on as Christ

00:31:44.524 --> 00:31:46.464
on the higher center there

00:31:46.664 --> 00:31:50.044
between, where you see this [lying], my red spot,

00:31:50.304 --> 00:31:52.501
is one of the windows.

00:31:52.702 --> 00:31:55.787
It is on the optic chiasma.

00:31:56.864 --> 00:31:59.403
And that’s how we say that

00:31:59.603 --> 00:32:03.720
Christ was the incarnation of innocence.

00:32:03.921 --> 00:32:08.079
Because He is sitting on the optic chiasma,

00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:10.650
He said that,

00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:17.356
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes”.

00:32:18.814 --> 00:32:21.364
This is the sentence He has used.

00:32:21.564 --> 00:32:24.424
To such a subtle way He has suggested

00:32:24.624 --> 00:32:27.984
that you will not have adulterous eyes,

00:32:28.184 --> 00:32:31.725
meaning you will have very pure eyes,

00:32:31.926 --> 00:32:33.883
innocent eyes.

00:32:34.084 --> 00:32:35.934
Why did He talk of the eyes?

00:32:36.134 --> 00:32:39.564
Because He’s sitting on the optic chiasma.

00:32:40.224 --> 00:32:42.904
It’s a very constricted center,

00:32:43.127 --> 00:32:45.883
and He was to be resurrected

00:32:46.084 --> 00:32:49.363
to show that you can also pass through

00:32:49.563 --> 00:32:51.383
that center very easily.

00:32:51.584 --> 00:32:56.084
So His message is not His crucifixion, but His resurrection.

00:32:56.414 --> 00:32:59.254
And that is how we are all going to resurrected,

00:32:59.454 --> 00:33:02.144
not after death, but right now.

00:33:03.024 --> 00:33:07.075
We should not postpone our resurrection any more.

00:33:08.374 --> 00:33:12.104
Then this second center that we have, is very important,

00:33:12.334 --> 00:33:15.404
which is called as the Swadisthana.

00:33:16.654 --> 00:33:20.509
This center looks after physical

00:33:20.724 --> 00:33:23.636
and our mental activities.

00:33:24.384 --> 00:33:26.014
Perhaps the doctors don’t know

00:33:26.214 --> 00:33:29.190
that it has a very important work to do,

00:33:29.391 --> 00:33:34.893
is that it has to nourish the brain

00:33:35.115 --> 00:33:39.313
with new cells,

00:33:39.874 --> 00:33:43.563
because all the time the brain is using

00:33:43.764 --> 00:33:45.864
these cells for its activity.

00:33:46.064 --> 00:33:49.464
So the energy has to go from this center,

00:33:49.704 --> 00:33:51.953
up there you can see

00:33:52.864 --> 00:33:56.823
and then it nourishes the center,

00:33:57.024 --> 00:33:59.680
it nourishes the brain

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:02.013
through its activity.

00:34:02.214 --> 00:34:04.133
Now when we are very futuristic

00:34:04.334 --> 00:34:06.917
or we are using too much of our brain, I should say,

00:34:07.118 --> 00:34:09.024
too much of our brain activity we have,

00:34:09.224 --> 00:34:11.628
we are futuristic, we are planning too much,

00:34:11.829 --> 00:34:15.624
thinking too much, all the time thoughts and thoughts and thoughts,

00:34:15.824 --> 00:34:21.054
that time we are using the energy of this center.

00:34:21.537 --> 00:34:26.064
But this center has another very important thing to be done,

00:34:26.264 --> 00:34:28.084
that it goes round, as you see,

00:34:28.284 --> 00:34:30.024
it moves all round here

00:34:30.224 --> 00:34:33.664
is shown here directly but it’s connected to the center

00:34:33.864 --> 00:34:36.224
and it moves round and round and round,

00:34:36.424 --> 00:34:39.364
and gives energy to this area

00:34:39.564 --> 00:34:43.284
where we have our liver, our pancreas,

00:34:43.894 --> 00:34:49.464
our spleen, kidney, and parts of intestines.

00:34:50.284 --> 00:34:54.533
Now if you start exhausting ourselves with too much thinking,

00:34:54.734 --> 00:34:58.334
then the main work of this center suffers

00:34:58.534 --> 00:35:02.484
and that’s how we develop all these diseases of all these organs:

00:35:02.684 --> 00:35:06.393
like for example, with liver you develop a liver problem.

00:35:06.594 --> 00:35:10.374
Liver problem means that liver has a function

00:35:10.574 --> 00:35:15.573
to emit heat from your body, which is poison,

00:35:15.774 --> 00:35:18.464
into the bloodstream.

00:35:18.665 --> 00:35:23.374
But when liver gets upset, we should say,

00:35:23.574 --> 00:35:26.373
the heat is retained in the liver.

00:35:26.574 --> 00:35:28.961
It passes upward and downward.

00:35:29.162 --> 00:35:31.333
When it passes upward it affects

00:35:31.534 --> 00:35:34.975
a center there, as you can see, which we call as the right heart,

00:35:35.176 --> 00:35:38.563
and people develop what we call the disease as asthma.

00:35:38.764 --> 00:35:41.084
And when it passes downwards

00:35:41.284 --> 00:35:43.273
it reaches the kidneys and coagulates

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:44.933
and you get kidney troubles,

00:35:45.134 --> 00:35:50.585
for which we have to go on dialysis and ultimately to die.

00:35:50.786 --> 00:35:56.872
So this heat is created because our liver is out of gear.

00:35:57.233 --> 00:35:59.843
At the same time this heat can also pass,

00:36:00.044 --> 00:36:02.981
if a person, say, at a very young age drinks

00:36:03.182 --> 00:36:06.381
and puts in too much of physical efforts

00:36:06.581 --> 00:36:09.411
and is all the time busy thinking, thinking,

00:36:09.612 --> 00:36:12.964
he might get a very fatal heart attack,

00:36:13.164 --> 00:36:15.694
because this heat can go towards his heart

00:36:15.894 --> 00:36:17.343
and just collapse it.

00:36:17.544 --> 00:36:20.364
Also those people work very hard like that

00:36:20.564 --> 00:36:22.977
can get a very massive heart attack.

00:36:23.178 --> 00:36:26.393
But the people who have other problems,

00:36:26.594 --> 00:36:29.310
on the left-hand side, are different type.

00:36:29.511 --> 00:36:32.797
They are the people who have lethargic organs.

00:36:33.104 --> 00:36:35.076
These organs do not work,

00:36:35.276 --> 00:36:37.053
and when they do not work

00:36:37.254 --> 00:36:39.224
then they have all the other problems

00:36:39.424 --> 00:36:41.284
of the left side, as we call it;

00:36:41.484 --> 00:36:45.063
and this also causes another serious problem

00:36:45.264 --> 00:36:47.524
of psychosomatic troubles.

00:36:47.814 --> 00:36:51.204
Now the essence of this center

00:36:51.404 --> 00:36:54.511
is that it is creativity.

00:36:55.734 --> 00:36:58.604
When the Kundalini nourishes this center,

00:36:58.814 --> 00:37:01.804
people become extremely creative.

00:37:02.024 --> 00:37:04.684
Now you have seen these artists who are playing here.

00:37:04.884 --> 00:37:07.654
They were very simple, ordinary artists,

00:37:07.854 --> 00:37:09.644
but after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:37:09.844 --> 00:37:11.984
suddenly they have bloomed so much.

00:37:12.244 --> 00:37:14.534
The most surprising thing is that people,

00:37:14.734 --> 00:37:16.664
say, even from Switzerland

00:37:16.864 --> 00:37:18.854
who do not know a word of Sanskrit,

00:37:19.054 --> 00:37:20.909
who do not know a word of Hindi language

00:37:21.110 --> 00:37:24.544
have composed poems, they have put them to tunes,

00:37:24.744 --> 00:37:28.324
and they sing as good as these people can sing.

00:37:28.684 --> 00:37:31.223
It's impossible to believe that even the English

00:37:31.423 --> 00:37:34.111
who were so difficult to even pronounce

00:37:34.312 --> 00:37:36.824
one sentence in Hindi language,

00:37:37.025 --> 00:37:41.024
are now fluently speaking Sanskrit and talking all these things;

00:37:41.284 --> 00:37:45.050
because of this creativity improves you.

00:37:45.273 --> 00:37:48.414
We have so many artists in India who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:48.614 --> 00:37:50.524
I don’t know if you know their names or not

00:37:50.724 --> 00:37:53.814
like Amjad Ali, Jalota, so many of them.

00:37:54.014 --> 00:37:55.336
They got their Realization

00:37:55.537 --> 00:37:58.853
and after that, now today they are very well-known artists.

00:37:59.054 --> 00:38:02.544
Also the paintings: we have some Australian people,

00:38:02.744 --> 00:38:05.004
who became quite good artists,

00:38:05.204 --> 00:38:06.924
after coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:07.124 --> 00:38:12.653
So it gives you a sense of aesthetics,

00:38:12.854 --> 00:38:16.804
and also it gives you the energy to express yourself.

00:38:17.094 --> 00:38:21.472
Now if you have the technique of how to create anything

00:38:21.673 --> 00:38:25.004
say you want to make a house or you want to paint,

00:38:25.205 --> 00:38:27.639
or if you want to do something,

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:30.084
mouldings or anything that you want to do

00:38:30.284 --> 00:38:33.204
if you have the technique,

00:38:33.524 --> 00:38:37.004
the creativity, the power of creativity starts pouring in you,

00:38:37.204 --> 00:38:38.817
and you start producing things

00:38:39.018 --> 00:38:42.254
on which you cannot even have thought of,

00:38:42.454 --> 00:38:44.424
and these things happen to a person.

00:38:44.624 --> 00:38:48.023
So a person can become extremely dynamic with this.

00:38:48.245 --> 00:38:52.654
But if with that you do not keep your Sahaja Yoga practice,

00:38:52.854 --> 00:38:56.613
means if you do not keep your connection with the Divine,

00:38:56.814 --> 00:38:59.164
then the energy gets exhausted.

00:38:59.414 --> 00:39:01.964
That’s why Self-Realization is very important

00:39:02.164 --> 00:39:04.734
for every artist,

00:39:04.934 --> 00:39:07.484
that he should get his connection

00:39:07.684 --> 00:39:09.504
with this All-pervading Power

00:39:09.704 --> 00:39:12.244
which is the combination of all the powers,

00:39:12.444 --> 00:39:15.144
so that he doesn’t feel exhausted with it.

00:39:15.344 --> 00:39:19.619
Not only that, but all the time this source is flowing into him.

00:39:19.873 --> 00:39:23.224
Constantly it has to flow, and that’s why you have to do

00:39:23.424 --> 00:39:25.181
a little practice of Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:25.382 --> 00:39:27.994
after getting your Realization, as I told you yesterday,

00:39:28.194 --> 00:39:30.204
that now you don’t stop at this point,

00:39:30.404 --> 00:39:32.464
you have to make the connection perfect.

00:39:32.665 --> 00:39:35.187
Without the connection,

00:39:35.387 --> 00:39:38.243
it may be that you may go down.

00:39:38.444 --> 00:39:42.522
So it’s best is to keep your connection on and work it out,

00:39:42.723 --> 00:39:46.924
to give full respect to yourself,

00:39:47.170 --> 00:39:48.823
to your being.

00:39:49.024 --> 00:39:51.374
You are not an ordinary thing,

00:39:51.574 --> 00:39:53.834
you are not a chicken or something like that.

00:39:54.034 --> 00:39:55.453
You are a human being.

00:39:55.654 --> 00:39:58.814
And the beauty that is within you is to be discovered,

00:39:59.024 --> 00:40:00.547
is to be nourished

00:40:00.748 --> 00:40:03.164
and to be proud of.

00:40:03.364 --> 00:40:05.781
It is such a great thing you have within yourself,

00:40:05.982 --> 00:40:08.933
the powers, which I’ll tell you one by one.

00:40:09.134 --> 00:40:13.724
Now above that is the, you see the third center.

00:40:13.924 --> 00:40:17.018
which is called as Nabhi, means the navel.

00:40:17.394 --> 00:40:21.604
This is the center of

00:40:22.254 --> 00:40:26.364
the way we absorb the virtues,

00:40:26.934 --> 00:40:30.164
or the virtues are enlightened.

00:40:30.364 --> 00:40:32.574
When this center is enlightened

00:40:32.774 --> 00:40:34.374
we really become righteous.

00:40:34.574 --> 00:40:37.444
We don’t have to tell, “Now you don’t do this and don’t do that”.

00:40:37.644 --> 00:40:39.048
You just become.

00:40:39.249 --> 00:40:41.493
Like a saint, a real saint,

00:40:41.694 --> 00:40:43.884
will not do wrong things.

00:40:44.084 --> 00:40:47.693
In the same way when a person gets his Realization,

00:40:47.894 --> 00:40:50.154
by the virtue of this center,

00:40:50.354 --> 00:40:53.704
he becomes absolutely balanced:

00:40:54.824 --> 00:40:58.384
balanced with his family life, with his wife, with his children,

00:40:58.614 --> 00:41:01.254
balanced with the politics, economics,

00:41:01.454 --> 00:41:03.284
balanced with the society,

00:41:03.484 --> 00:41:06.694
balanced with all the people whom he knows;

00:41:06.894 --> 00:41:11.064
in a very balancing way he starts behaving.

00:41:11.264 --> 00:41:13.603
There’s not one-sided activity.

00:41:13.804 --> 00:41:17.247
For example, somebody may be very much attached to the wife

00:41:17.534 --> 00:41:19.704
and may try to harm others.

00:41:19.954 --> 00:41:22.811
Somebody who is very much attached to others,

00:41:23.011 --> 00:41:24.325
may harm his wife.

00:41:24.526 --> 00:41:27.744
So a kind of a balance is established by this,

00:41:27.974 --> 00:41:30.454
and a person who gets this

00:41:30.654 --> 00:41:34.213
develops a personality which we call as regal.

00:41:34.414 --> 00:41:37.254
That sense of dignity comes into such a person.

00:41:37.464 --> 00:41:40.913
Now you see our children have lost the virtues,

00:41:41.114 --> 00:41:43.484
our children don’t have that regalty.

00:41:43.684 --> 00:41:45.799
They have become very cheapish also,

00:41:45.999 --> 00:41:48.547
and they run after materialism and things like that;

00:41:48.748 --> 00:41:50.579
they fight for small, small things.

00:41:50.780 --> 00:41:53.644
It’s not only children, even the grown-ups are like that

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:55.844
and they try to waste their energy,

00:41:56.044 --> 00:41:58.504
fighting for something that is so useless.

00:41:58.704 --> 00:42:01.628
So by enlightenment of this center

00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:05.344
you understand the value of matter.

00:42:05.624 --> 00:42:07.924
And the value of matter is this:

00:42:08.125 --> 00:42:10.324
that it has aesthetics, first of all,

00:42:10.524 --> 00:42:15.194
and secondly, you can express your love only through matter.

00:42:15.404 --> 00:42:18.324
If you love somebody you’ll give them something,

00:42:18.524 --> 00:42:21.324
a little flower also can express your love.

00:42:21.524 --> 00:42:24.284
Anything can express your love through matter,

00:42:24.484 --> 00:42:26.564
and then you become a very generous

00:42:26.764 --> 00:42:29.094
and very enjoyable person.

00:42:29.294 --> 00:42:30.771
Some people feel

00:42:30.972 --> 00:42:33.003
that if you become generous, you will be bankrupt.

00:42:33.204 --> 00:42:35.145
It’s not so. On the contrary,

00:42:35.346 --> 00:42:38.634
if you open one door, no air will come in,

00:42:38.864 --> 00:42:42.808
but if you open the other door, all the air will start circulating.

00:42:43.009 --> 00:42:46.174
In the same way, when a person is generous

00:42:46.374 --> 00:42:48.755
he starts getting so many blessings -

00:42:48.956 --> 00:42:52.436
because he is also connected with the Divine - that he is amazed.

00:42:52.637 --> 00:42:55.084
He doesn’t know what to do with the things that he has got,

00:42:55.284 --> 00:42:57.134
and then he starts pouring it to others.

00:42:57.334 --> 00:42:59.822
There are so many things people are telling Me about,

00:43:00.023 --> 00:43:02.835
miracles and miracles of even material things

00:43:03.035 --> 00:43:06.964
in their jobs, in their purchasing, in their shopping,

00:43:07.164 --> 00:43:09.804
the way they have seen miracles happening

00:43:10.004 --> 00:43:12.094
that it is nothing but just

00:43:12.294 --> 00:43:15.254
that this center is enlightened.

00:43:15.454 --> 00:43:19.764
And with this center, within you a righteousness comes in.

00:43:20.084 --> 00:43:24.113
And this righteousness doesn’t force anybody else,

00:43:24.314 --> 00:43:29.378
it’s just righteousness itself which doesn’t command anything

00:43:29.579 --> 00:43:31.171
or demand anything,

00:43:31.372 --> 00:43:34.369
but it becomes a respectable personality,

00:43:34.570 --> 00:43:37.814
and you just start really understanding

00:43:38.014 --> 00:43:39.203
that, “Look at this man”.

00:43:39.404 --> 00:43:42.336
Somebody was telling Me today that in the office people asked,

00:43:42.537 --> 00:43:44.804
“How are you so dignified?”

00:43:45.004 --> 00:43:46.824
He said, “I didn’t know I was so dignified.”

00:43:47.024 --> 00:43:49.024
"No, you don’t do anything undignified,

00:43:49.224 --> 00:43:52.524
and you do everything just like a child also".

00:43:52.724 --> 00:43:55.534
So there’s a child-like dignity you develop,

00:43:55.734 --> 00:43:59.084
and it’s a beautiful thing to happen, really it’s angelic.

00:43:59.304 --> 00:44:01.993
Now then there, we have another center on top,

00:44:02.194 --> 00:44:04.223
which we call as the heart center.

00:44:04.424 --> 00:44:06.454
It is in the center.

00:44:06.654 --> 00:44:08.823
Now in the sternum bone, behind the sternum bone

00:44:09.024 --> 00:44:10.304
this center is there,

00:44:10.505 --> 00:44:14.077
and thymus produces the antibodies

00:44:14.278 --> 00:44:15.843
in your sternum bone.

00:44:16.044 --> 00:44:19.715
These antibodies, later on, fight your diseases.

00:44:20.624 --> 00:44:22.603
When you are about twelve years of age

00:44:22.804 --> 00:44:25.262
they go into the whole body, and waiting there,

00:44:25.463 --> 00:44:31.370
for a signal from your sternum bone.

00:44:31.804 --> 00:44:34.282
That means supposing you see something, you get frightened,

00:44:34.483 --> 00:44:36.129
this bone starts pulsating.

00:44:36.330 --> 00:44:39.564
When it pulsates, the antibodies know there’s some emergency,

00:44:39.764 --> 00:44:41.803
and they get prepared for it.

00:44:42.004 --> 00:44:46.272
Now this is such a normal thing to happen to people.

00:44:46.473 --> 00:44:50.134
But the insecurities can be of the worst type,

00:44:50.334 --> 00:44:52.864
and when these insecurities develop,

00:44:53.064 --> 00:44:55.864
people can develop all kinds of diseases of the lungs;

00:44:56.064 --> 00:44:57.614
specially the women develop

00:44:57.814 --> 00:45:00.064
what you call as the breast cancer.

00:45:00.304 --> 00:45:01.894
Mostly these women are insecure:

00:45:02.094 --> 00:45:04.824
maybe their husbands are not good, or they feel

00:45:05.024 --> 00:45:07.814
that the husband may leave them alone or something like that.

00:45:08.014 --> 00:45:10.734
There are certain insecurities that are built in.

00:45:10.944 --> 00:45:13.844
They might be quite frightened people, personalities.

00:45:14.044 --> 00:45:16.043
I have seen most of the air-hostesses

00:45:16.244 --> 00:45:18.143
have this center heart catching,

00:45:18.344 --> 00:45:21.180
because they are afraid they may miss the plane or I don’t know,

00:45:21.381 --> 00:45:23.864
they have to be on the job and run and do.

00:45:24.064 --> 00:45:26.644
Mostly these time-bound jobs

00:45:26.844 --> 00:45:30.164
cause you a trouble here of the center heart,

00:45:30.424 --> 00:45:32.944
and this center heart is very important,

00:45:33.144 --> 00:45:35.844
because for women specially, they have to be secured.

00:45:36.064 --> 00:45:39.184
If their motherhood is challenged then they are even worse.

00:45:39.384 --> 00:45:41.488
And this is how one has to understand,

00:45:41.689 --> 00:45:43.934
a woman should be very much respected

00:45:44.134 --> 00:45:47.434
if she is your wife, she’s your child or anything.

00:45:47.635 --> 00:45:50.854
She has to be respected and given all the security.

00:45:51.054 --> 00:45:52.974
It’s the woman who makes the society,

00:45:53.174 --> 00:45:54.884
it's the woman who creates the children,

00:45:55.084 --> 00:45:57.203
it's the woman who looks after the children.

00:45:57.404 --> 00:46:01.133
So the men have to give all the security and the protection

00:46:01.334 --> 00:46:05.484
to the womenhood and understand that is a very important factor,

00:46:05.684 --> 00:46:10.164
which if we neglect we can have lots of problems with our society;

00:46:10.364 --> 00:46:12.744
and the women will start competing with men

00:46:12.944 --> 00:46:16.264
and then the society will be all dislocated.

00:46:17.524 --> 00:46:20.494
So the center on the left side and the right side

00:46:20.694 --> 00:46:24.644
are the centers of your father, of your mother and your father.

00:46:25.054 --> 00:46:26.974
If there’s any problem with your father,

00:46:27.174 --> 00:46:31.204
then the right side catches and it gives you asthma.

00:46:31.404 --> 00:46:33.658
First of all you are, we can say,

00:46:33.859 --> 00:46:35.844
vulnerable to asthma, due to bad liver.

00:46:36.044 --> 00:46:37.723
Plus if you have problems with your father

00:46:37.924 --> 00:46:39.544
or if with your fatherhood -

00:46:39.744 --> 00:46:41.464
supposing you are an unhappy father,

00:46:41.664 --> 00:46:44.374
or maybe that you are not looking after your children,

00:46:44.574 --> 00:46:47.144
then you get this center caught up very badly.

00:46:47.374 --> 00:46:49.259
Then on the left side is the mother’s,

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:52.163
and the mother’s thing is that when some mothers

00:46:52.364 --> 00:46:55.181
are not good mothers; also children can get this.

00:46:55.382 --> 00:47:01.304
Or when the children are not nice to the mother, they also get it.

00:47:01.504 --> 00:47:05.824
So mother and father are very important factors in Sahaja Yoga,

00:47:06.024 --> 00:47:08.029
and you have to understand

00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:11.100
that if your parents have been unkind to you,

00:47:11.301 --> 00:47:13.579
you must forgive them. Just forget about them.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:16.242
Because they have given you birth, you should be thankful,

00:47:16.443 --> 00:47:17.934
and just forget about them.

00:47:18.134 --> 00:47:22.854
That’s the best way to get over the problem of left and right heart.

00:47:23.304 --> 00:47:26.364
Then we have, on top, if you see, is this chakra

00:47:26.564 --> 00:47:29.543
which we call as the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:47:29.744 --> 00:47:32.824
This Vishuddhi chakra is, has got sixteen petals,

00:47:33.024 --> 00:47:37.244
and looks after our ear, nose, eyes, throat, everything.

00:47:37.484 --> 00:47:41.774
Our face, everything is looked after by this center.

00:47:42.024 --> 00:47:43.864
Now this center also has left and right.

00:47:44.064 --> 00:47:45.574
All centers have left and right

00:47:45.774 --> 00:47:48.054
and when you feel guilty

00:47:48.254 --> 00:47:50.664
the left center catches,

00:47:50.864 --> 00:47:52.480
which is a very dangerous thing

00:47:52.681 --> 00:47:55.454
because this gives you diseases like angina,

00:47:55.654 --> 00:48:00.693
or maybe diseases like spondylitis and lethargic organs.

00:48:00.894 --> 00:48:04.444
Right when a person is very aggressive, talks very aggressively,

00:48:04.654 --> 00:48:07.134
and tries to dominate others,

00:48:07.334 --> 00:48:12.239
and use his power of speech to show off,

00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.840
the right side catches.

00:48:14.041 --> 00:48:17.824
The reactions of this can be many, that the hands gets frozen,

00:48:18.024 --> 00:48:20.984
and they also get the cancer of the throat;

00:48:21.184 --> 00:48:22.844
all kinds of things can happen

00:48:23.044 --> 00:48:26.204
with this chakra being in trouble.

00:48:26.594 --> 00:48:31.124
Now then we go to the chakra here, in between the optic chiasma.

00:48:31.324 --> 00:48:34.094
It is placed like this, and it’s absolutely closed.

00:48:34.294 --> 00:48:36.149
It is when you forgive.

00:48:36.350 --> 00:48:38.778
Christ has said that you have to forgive.

00:48:38.978 --> 00:48:41.553
When you forgive

00:48:41.754 --> 00:48:44.948
everyone and also when

00:48:45.964 --> 00:48:48.924
you ask for forgiveness,

00:48:49.584 --> 00:48:51.684
this chakra opens like this.

00:48:51.934 --> 00:48:53.517
Otherwise it cannot open.

00:48:53.717 --> 00:48:55.896
We saw yesterday that some people,

00:48:56.097 --> 00:48:58.524
at least there were ten, fifteen people

00:48:58.724 --> 00:49:01.494
who never got their Realization, because they had not forgiven.

00:49:01.694 --> 00:49:04.454
Then when I put My hand, worked on them and it worked.

00:49:04.654 --> 00:49:06.744
But it’s very simple to forgive,

00:49:06.944 --> 00:49:08.744
because whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

00:49:08.944 --> 00:49:10.497
you don’t do anything, it’s a myth,

00:49:10.698 --> 00:49:12.852
it’s absolutely a myth that you don’t forgive.

00:49:13.053 --> 00:49:16.014
But for that myth you suffered so much.

00:49:16.244 --> 00:49:19.774
So you have to forgive, to open this center of Agnya.

00:49:19.974 --> 00:49:22.454
It’s very important and is,

00:49:22.654 --> 00:49:25.494
the deity on that is Jesus Christ.

00:49:25.714 --> 00:49:28.364
Then you enter into the area called limbic area

00:49:28.564 --> 00:49:31.424
which is on top, which is called as Sahasrara in Sanskrit,

00:49:31.624 --> 00:49:34.372
means there are one thousand petals.

00:49:34.674 --> 00:49:37.644
These look like

00:49:38.164 --> 00:49:40.504
“tongues of flames” as described in the Bible.

00:49:40.704 --> 00:49:42.624
All of them look like “tongues of flames”

00:49:42.824 --> 00:49:46.453
but in the brain they are of seven colors,

00:49:46.654 --> 00:49:51.680
beautifully, very silently, peacefully

00:49:53.301 --> 00:49:56.013
opening, closing, opening, closing.

00:49:56.214 --> 00:49:59.124
So when the Kundalini goes into the limbic area

00:49:59.324 --> 00:50:02.050
it enlightens your brain, it enlightens.

00:50:02.251 --> 00:50:04.574
And as I told yesterday there are many children

00:50:04.774 --> 00:50:07.190
who have been dullards, have now

00:50:07.391 --> 00:50:10.001
records in their examination,

00:50:10.202 --> 00:50:12.880
and they have put so much of

00:50:13.080 --> 00:50:15.823
new dimension to their understanding,

00:50:16.024 --> 00:50:19.304
that their teachers, their professors are surprised.

00:50:19.504 --> 00:50:22.104
This is what happens when the brain,

00:50:22.304 --> 00:50:25.124
which is used very little, starts getting enlightened.

00:50:25.324 --> 00:50:27.893
Automatically you start using it.

00:50:28.094 --> 00:50:30.804
Then it pierces through the fontanel bone area,

00:50:31.004 --> 00:50:33.264
which is a very soft bone,

00:50:33.884 --> 00:50:36.793
through which this Kundalini comes out.

00:50:36.994 --> 00:50:42.783
I told you yesterday that Kundalini is your mother,

00:50:42.984 --> 00:50:44.304
individual mother,

00:50:44.504 --> 00:50:48.094
and she is the power of pure desire.

00:50:48.324 --> 00:50:51.444
All other desires that we have are impure.

00:50:51.644 --> 00:50:56.100
Today we want to have, say, a chair,

00:50:56.300 --> 00:50:59.563
then we want to have a table, then we want to have a house, then...

00:50:59.764 --> 00:51:02.230
We are never satisfied, we go from one to another;

00:51:02.437 --> 00:51:07.533
and it is a principle of economics that

00:51:07.734 --> 00:51:10.734
wants are not satiable in general.

00:51:10.934 --> 00:51:13.304
So what is that want which is satiable?

00:51:13.504 --> 00:51:15.404
Is this want, this pure desire.

00:51:15.604 --> 00:51:16.951
And what is the pure desire,

00:51:17.151 --> 00:51:19.663
is to be one with this divine power.

00:51:19.864 --> 00:51:21.344
Whether you know it or not,

00:51:21.544 --> 00:51:23.253
whether you are aware of it or not,

00:51:23.454 --> 00:51:25.544
it exists in all the human beings

00:51:25.744 --> 00:51:27.884
and the only thing that has to be done is

00:51:28.084 --> 00:51:30.214
it is to be awakened

00:51:30.414 --> 00:51:33.533
and to be connected to this All-pervading Power.

00:51:33.733 --> 00:51:35.387
So the truth is that

00:51:35.587 --> 00:51:39.239
you are not this body, not this mind,

00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:42.403
not these conditionings or ego,

00:51:42.604 --> 00:51:44.663
but you are the pure Spirit.

00:51:44.864 --> 00:51:49.654
And the second one, is that with this All-pervading Power,

00:51:49.854 --> 00:51:51.764
which is a wonderful thing,

00:51:51.964 --> 00:51:55.454
is impossible to describe it in this short lecture of Mine

00:51:55.654 --> 00:51:58.563
but it’s the one which organizes,

00:51:58.764 --> 00:52:00.734
which does all the living work.

00:52:00.934 --> 00:52:03.284
To the minutest things it organizes,

00:52:03.484 --> 00:52:05.872
so complicated everything is,

00:52:06.072 --> 00:52:07.730
but it manages all that.

00:52:07.931 --> 00:52:10.266
Not only, but above all,

00:52:10.467 --> 00:52:13.053
it forgives and it loves.

00:52:13.254 --> 00:52:15.944
So such a beautiful power is all around us,

00:52:16.144 --> 00:52:17.994
so why should we have any worry?

00:52:18.194 --> 00:52:21.024
And now we have to know

00:52:21.224 --> 00:52:23.097
that yesterday we had lots of questions,

00:52:23.298 --> 00:52:24.764
and nice questions were there.

00:52:24.964 --> 00:52:27.624
Today also I would like you to ask Me questions.

00:52:27.824 --> 00:52:30.202
But in asking questions, please remember

00:52:30.403 --> 00:52:33.281
not to ask “What is Your opinion about this person or that person?”

00:52:33.482 --> 00:52:36.205
Of course, now you must have known that I condemn all the people

00:52:36.406 --> 00:52:39.174
who take money in the name of God; absolutely openly.

00:52:39.374 --> 00:52:42.205
So please don’t ask Me questions about such people.

00:52:42.406 --> 00:52:46.684
Moreover, you ask questions which are related to our subject,

00:52:46.884 --> 00:52:48.504
because I have come here

00:52:48.704 --> 00:52:50.294
not to get anything out of you,

00:52:50.494 --> 00:52:52.334
but to give you what is your own:

00:52:52.534 --> 00:52:55.484
your beauty, your divinity, your glory.

00:52:55.684 --> 00:52:58.025
And then you will be surprised

00:52:58.226 --> 00:53:01.563
that the first thing that happens to you

00:53:01.763 --> 00:53:04.140
is a new awareness, it's a new dimension

00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.903
in your awareness comes in

00:53:07.104 --> 00:53:10.934
and this awareness is called as collective consciousness,

00:53:11.134 --> 00:53:13.654
by which you feel others on your fingertips.

00:53:13.854 --> 00:53:16.144
Who is the other then?

00:53:16.908 --> 00:53:21.493
Also within yourself you can feel what’s wrong with you.

00:53:21.694 --> 00:53:25.234
Only thing, you have to be decoding these signals

00:53:25.444 --> 00:53:27.932
and you should know how to correct it.

00:53:28.133 --> 00:53:31.014
This is what has to happen, which is very simple.

00:53:31.214 --> 00:53:33.934
Within a month’s time you can become your own masters,

00:53:34.134 --> 00:53:38.084
and you know how to treat yourself and how to look after yourself.

00:53:38.574 --> 00:53:41.024
I’m sorry I am here in only for today.

00:53:41.224 --> 00:53:42.854
Tomorrow I have to go to Canberra.

00:53:43.054 --> 00:53:45.304
And in this lecture,

00:53:45.504 --> 00:53:48.014
whatever was possible in short, I've tried to tell you

00:53:48.214 --> 00:53:51.014
about this great mechanism that is within us.

00:53:51.215 --> 00:53:54.683
But by this you achieve so many beautiful things,

00:53:54.884 --> 00:53:56.387
as I told you yesterday,

00:53:56.588 --> 00:53:59.593
that you achieve the peace,

00:53:59.794 --> 00:54:01.775
you achieve the witness state,

00:54:01.984 --> 00:54:04.334
you achieve the collective consciousness,

00:54:04.535 --> 00:54:06.536
you achieve

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:12.543
the light in your attention, which acts.

00:54:12.744 --> 00:54:17.198
You pay attention to something, it acts, it works.

00:54:17.454 --> 00:54:21.044
Then you get the power that you can raise the Kundalini of others.

00:54:21.244 --> 00:54:25.093
Like one light enlightened can enlighten another light.

00:54:25.294 --> 00:54:28.604
Then it gives you a complete idea

00:54:28.844 --> 00:54:32.102
about yourself and about others.

00:54:32.524 --> 00:54:36.631
Above all, you get an absolute knowledge

00:54:37.004 --> 00:54:38.614
about everything.

00:54:38.824 --> 00:54:42.040
When you have the absolute knowledge, there’s no quarrel, no war,

00:54:42.241 --> 00:54:46.293
because everybody knows it on their fingertips.

00:54:46.494 --> 00:54:50.604
To know on your central nervous system is the real bodha,

00:54:50.804 --> 00:54:52.867
from where the word Buddha has come,

00:54:53.068 --> 00:54:55.783
is the "vida", from where the word Vedas has come.

00:54:55.984 --> 00:54:59.984
Gnostics, “gn”: “gn” means “jnana”. “Jnana” means the knowledge.

00:55:00.204 --> 00:55:02.479
And the knowledge is not mental knowledge,

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.934
but the knowledge on your central nervous system.

00:55:06.134 --> 00:55:11.344
Whatever we have achieved in our ascent as human beings,

00:55:11.544 --> 00:55:14.904
we have got all this on our central nervous system.

00:55:15.104 --> 00:55:20.853
For example, you take a dog or a horse through a dirty place,

00:55:21.054 --> 00:55:22.632
he can pass through easily;

00:55:22.833 --> 00:55:24.358
but a human being cannot pass,

00:55:24.559 --> 00:55:27.653
because he has developed a new awareness about it.

00:55:27.854 --> 00:55:31.363
He knows what is beauty is, he knows what virtues are,

00:55:31.564 --> 00:55:33.593
he knows what is sin is.

00:55:33.794 --> 00:55:36.414
For an animal there is no sin, he’ll do whatever he likes,

00:55:36.614 --> 00:55:40.760
because he’s completely under the control of the Divine.

00:55:41.113 --> 00:55:43.563
But for human beings there’s freedom,

00:55:43.764 --> 00:55:47.404
and he has to judge it with trial and error

00:55:47.604 --> 00:55:49.594
and reach a point to understand

00:55:49.794 --> 00:55:54.544
that he has to get to a higher awareness.

00:55:55.254 --> 00:55:57.551
May God bless you all.

00:56:15.315 --> 00:56:17.709
Thank you.

00:56:27.304 --> 00:56:32.256
You have to ask the questions. I think they are all forgotten!

00:56:49.694 --> 00:56:52.509
Are melanomas and skin-cancers

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:55.064
caused by a blockage in a chakra?

00:56:55.304 --> 00:56:58.207
Yes, all. Of course,

00:56:58.408 --> 00:57:01.109
all our diseases are because of the blockage in the chakras,

00:57:01.310 --> 00:57:02.333
no doubt.

00:57:02.534 --> 00:57:05.894
But see now, if you have to treat a tree

00:57:06.094 --> 00:57:09.084
and you start putting the medicine on the leaves,

00:57:09.284 --> 00:57:11.934
it will never be cured. You have to go to the roots.

00:57:12.134 --> 00:57:14.624
And because it is at the roots, it’s so simple.

00:57:14.824 --> 00:57:18.589
Only there are seven chakras and three nadis

00:57:18.790 --> 00:57:21.731
means about twenty-one permutations and combinations,

00:57:21.932 --> 00:57:24.408
you have to work out, that’s all.

00:57:39.916 --> 00:57:45.512
In meditation, where should we put our consciousness in the body?

00:57:46.524 --> 00:57:49.484
You don’t have to do anything, you just get into it.

00:57:49.684 --> 00:57:52.564
When the Kundalini crosses over this center,

00:57:52.764 --> 00:57:54.924
immediately you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:57:55.164 --> 00:57:57.574
That’s a state when you are in the present,

00:57:57.774 --> 00:58:00.064
neither in the future, not in the past.

00:58:00.294 --> 00:58:04.283
and then the growth, spiritual growth starts working it out.

00:58:04.484 --> 00:58:06.303
And suddenly you will find one day

00:58:06.504 --> 00:58:11.581
that you have touched that depth of your divinity.

00:58:15.224 --> 00:58:17.224
You don’t have to direct yourself at all.

00:58:17.424 --> 00:58:19.824
The Kundalini itself directs.

00:58:35.317 --> 00:58:36.894
Yes?

00:58:37.094 --> 00:58:40.292
Mother, I'd like to know the relationship

00:58:40.493 --> 00:58:43.897
between what is happening in the world in terms of the pollution

00:58:44.098 --> 00:58:47.317
and the damage that's been [unclear] and harms us

00:58:47.518 --> 00:58:50.345
Is there an object, a lesson for mankind in that?

00:58:50.546 --> 00:58:52.849
And I suppose, most, most of us would say "yes",

00:58:53.050 --> 00:58:55.795
but what is the spiritual aspect of what we are doing to our world,

00:58:55.996 --> 00:58:57.328
[what is spiritually to be done]?

00:58:57.529 --> 00:59:01.417
- What's this?
What is the spiritual significance

00:59:01.618 --> 00:59:05.493
on what we are doing to our world in the sense of pollution?

00:59:05.694 --> 00:59:10.292
Yes, spiritual aspect is that we do not have a balance.

00:59:12.574 --> 00:59:15.653
Now once we start a machine,

00:59:15.854 --> 00:59:19.213
then machine has to produce, go on producing like mad.

00:59:19.483 --> 00:59:21.363
It produces more and more.

00:59:21.564 --> 00:59:24.773
Then the accent is on money, not on Spirit.

00:59:24.974 --> 00:59:26.357
So what happens?

00:59:26.558 --> 00:59:29.014
That they produce more and more things

00:59:29.214 --> 00:59:33.334
and they create an atmosphere through advertisement, this, that

00:59:33.574 --> 00:59:36.823
and everybody starts running for it.

00:59:37.024 --> 00:59:41.504
Then we have accumulation of so much of rubbish,

00:59:41.704 --> 00:59:45.533
and what you have done is that you have exhausted the Mother Earth.

00:59:45.734 --> 00:59:49.324
But when you get your Realization and when you are spiritual,

00:59:49.524 --> 00:59:52.174
then what happens, you buy very few things,

00:59:52.374 --> 00:59:54.173
but very good things.

00:59:54.374 --> 00:59:57.022
You don’t run after the fashions or anything,

00:59:57.222 --> 00:59:59.173
but you make a dress

00:59:59.374 --> 01:00:02.644
which is good for you, which is decent for you,

01:00:02.864 --> 01:00:07.044
and may not be one hundred dresses,

01:00:07.244 --> 01:00:09.244
maybe five or six,

01:00:09.444 --> 01:00:14.173
but very beautiful, dignified, artistic dresses.

01:00:14.374 --> 01:00:17.135
In the same way now, supposing

01:00:17.724 --> 01:00:20.584
I tell you that “you don’t drink any alcohol,”

01:00:20.784 --> 01:00:23.423
you will all run away. But I don’t say that.

01:00:23.624 --> 01:00:26.624
After Sahaja Yoga, people just don’t drink.

01:00:26.904 --> 01:00:28.694
Now your money is saved by that.

01:00:28.894 --> 01:00:31.465
But also what is saved in that is

01:00:31.665 --> 01:00:37.384
the amount of paraphernalia you need for a drinking party!

01:00:41.584 --> 01:00:45.687
First time, in India I never used to serve any drinks in My house,

01:00:45.888 --> 01:00:48.105
but C.P. said, "In England You have to do it”.

01:00:48.306 --> 01:00:50.099
My husband said,“You have to do it there” .

01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.254
I said, “All right, that’s your lookout, not Mine”.

01:00:52.484 --> 01:00:55.025
So he got hold of a dictionary, you see,

01:00:55.226 --> 01:00:56.692
a French dictionary, to find out

01:00:56.893 --> 01:00:59.383
what all we have to buy to begin with.

01:00:59.584 --> 01:01:02.138
So you’ll be amazed, at that time -

01:01:02.339 --> 01:01:07.066
it was in 1973 we went to London, yes -

01:01:07.267 --> 01:01:08.830
and he said that,

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:13.482
“At least we’ll have to pay nine hundred pounds,

01:01:13.734 --> 01:01:16.294
to get the best quality tumblers”.

01:01:16.494 --> 01:01:19.313
I said, “Nine hundred pounds for what?” He said,

01:01:19.514 --> 01:01:23.303
“For everything you have to have a different type of a tumbler.”

01:01:23.504 --> 01:01:26.454
I said, “Really, but for what? What is the need?”

01:01:26.654 --> 01:01:29.394
He said, “That’s the custom, that’s the norm”.

01:01:29.594 --> 01:01:32.124
So you see, also the norms that we have created

01:01:32.324 --> 01:01:35.031
are so stupid. There is no need.

01:01:35.464 --> 01:01:38.104
Instead of that in India supposing you are well off, all right,

01:01:38.304 --> 01:01:43.283
they’ll have six tumblers made of silver,

01:01:43.484 --> 01:01:47.084
which they’ll pass on from father to son,

01:01:47.334 --> 01:01:50.824
son to his son, and that’s all.

01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:53.254
You won’t need many things.

01:01:53.454 --> 01:01:57.766
Or plates now; so you’ll have first course, then a second course,

01:01:57.967 --> 01:02:00.843
and a third course, and then you start moving

01:02:01.044 --> 01:02:05.144
with all your cutlery this way, then this way, then this way,

01:02:05.344 --> 01:02:08.430
and really you don’t know what to do with it.

01:02:08.631 --> 01:02:10.313
So there’s no need to do all that.

01:02:10.514 --> 01:02:12.794
There’s no need, you see, to do it.

01:02:12.994 --> 01:02:14.683
What is the necessity, you see?

01:02:14.884 --> 01:02:18.301
But you could be simple, you could use your fingers, is the best,

01:02:18.502 --> 01:02:21.402
because after Realization you have vibrations in your hands,

01:02:21.603 --> 01:02:22.853
divine vibrations.

01:02:23.054 --> 01:02:24.715
So you start using your hands,

01:02:24.916 --> 01:02:29.174
and you can use a one nice plate of brass

01:02:29.374 --> 01:02:31.884
or of silver, in that same amount.

01:02:32.084 --> 01:02:34.364
You see, six plates of silver

01:02:34.564 --> 01:02:41.383
cost you the same as this elaborate, say, a dinner-set

01:02:41.584 --> 01:02:46.343
which is always, I would say,

01:02:46.544 --> 01:02:49.884
has to be replaced because it breaks, this happens, that happens.

01:02:50.084 --> 01:02:53.564
And the same plates you can pass on to other people.

01:02:53.765 --> 01:02:56.064
There are so many things, we waste our time.

01:02:56.264 --> 01:03:00.334
Now if you go to a lady’s apartment,

01:03:00.534 --> 01:03:03.274
you will be surprised that the whole place will be filled

01:03:03.474 --> 01:03:06.625
with this Elizabeth Arden, this, that, that, that.

01:03:06.826 --> 01:03:09.733
You open something, it all falls on you.

01:03:09.934 --> 01:03:11.957
And then you say, “Why have you got so many?”

01:03:12.158 --> 01:03:13.907
“No, Mother, this is gone out of fashion.”

01:03:14.108 --> 01:03:16.564
“Baba, whatever it was good for your skin,

01:03:16.784 --> 01:03:19.644
whatever was once good for you, use that throughout”.

01:03:19.844 --> 01:03:21.444
“No, but they are changing every time.”

01:03:21.644 --> 01:03:24.284
I said, “But you decide what you want to use it,

01:03:24.484 --> 01:03:26.784
and use that thing all through.

01:03:26.984 --> 01:03:30.244
What’s the use of filling these cupboards with all this?”

01:03:30.764 --> 01:03:33.969
You see, we were in London, we were searching out houses

01:03:34.170 --> 01:03:38.044
and I mean, horrible, I tell you, the experiences were.

01:03:38.324 --> 01:03:40.744
You go into any house and suddenly you’ll find

01:03:40.944 --> 01:03:42.964
two legs of the pants falling on, to your [room].

01:03:43.164 --> 01:03:45.748
And then you look up and there’s a pile of things

01:03:45.949 --> 01:03:47.364
kept on the top of the loft.

01:03:47.564 --> 01:03:49.964
Just the loft is overfilled with all the clothes.

01:03:50.164 --> 01:03:52.963
And so much was filled.

01:03:53.164 --> 01:03:56.164
I tell you, Australians are much more neater people,

01:03:56.365 --> 01:03:58.344
but if you go to England you’ll be shocked,

01:03:58.544 --> 01:04:00.767
because they are the buyers,

01:04:00.968 --> 01:04:03.854
for ages they have been buying, buying, buying, buying,

01:04:04.054 --> 01:04:06.284
and there’s no place for human beings to live inside.

01:04:06.485 --> 01:04:09.058
They live outside,

01:04:11.684 --> 01:04:12.915
in the Hyde Park!

01:04:13.116 --> 01:04:15.229
They are sitting in the Hyde Park. If you ask them,

01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:19.137
“Why are you here?”, “Our house are overfull”.

01:04:23.074 --> 01:04:24.724
So you develop the balance.

01:04:24.924 --> 01:04:27.213
And because of this lack of balance,

01:04:27.413 --> 01:04:30.269
there is ecological problem.

01:04:34.570 --> 01:04:36.207
Is Kundalini to be developed

01:04:36.407 --> 01:04:40.109
within certain age of human existence

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:44.214
or can it be developed any age?

01:04:46.744 --> 01:04:50.452
Is the Kundalini to be developed

01:04:50.723 --> 01:04:54.259
you know, at a certain age in human existence,

01:04:54.460 --> 01:04:56.384
or can it be developed at any age?

01:04:56.624 --> 01:04:59.243
At any age. There’s nothing like that.

01:04:59.444 --> 01:05:04.081
There’s no age, no time, nothing. It’s beyond all that.

01:05:05.484 --> 01:05:08.424
Even so many children are born realized these days.

01:05:08.624 --> 01:05:11.974
Sahaja Yogis get the children, when they marry,

01:05:12.174 --> 01:05:14.414
they get children who are already born realized.

01:05:14.614 --> 01:05:17.253
They are so wise, you know, very wise,

01:05:17.454 --> 01:05:21.934
and they come and have a conference with Me very special.

01:05:22.134 --> 01:05:25.037
And then they tell Me about all the uncle and aunties,

01:05:25.238 --> 01:05:28.044
what’s wrong with their chakras.

01:05:31.173 --> 01:05:33.183
They are My great friends, I should say;

01:05:33.384 --> 01:05:36.085
but very wise, you know.

01:05:59.204 --> 01:06:02.214
She was recently told that she should never meditate

01:06:02.415 --> 01:06:04.784
unless she’s had a glass of water.

01:06:04.984 --> 01:06:07.018
- Should I? For Me?
- This is neccessary...

01:06:07.219 --> 01:06:10.173
- For Me?
- No, no, anyone meditating.

01:06:10.381 --> 01:06:13.508
- I didn’t understand, what is it?
- Nor did I.

01:06:14.848 --> 01:06:19.284
She said she was recently told that she shouldn’t meditate

01:06:19.485 --> 01:06:22.534
until she’s had a glass of water.

01:06:23.424 --> 01:06:26.196
Are you? Sahaja Yogis told you that?

01:06:26.396 --> 01:06:28.533
Yes, [finding how]...

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:32.283
See, sometimes what happens, supposing you are a liver patient,

01:06:32.484 --> 01:06:36.174
then the heat might be generated out of your head, you see,

01:06:36.374 --> 01:06:38.183
like a chimney it opens out.

01:06:38.384 --> 01:06:40.028
So if you take little water,

01:06:40.229 --> 01:06:42.904
the heat won’t feel so much. May be that.

01:06:43.104 --> 01:06:45.214
But I get the heat from all the rest of the people,

01:06:45.422 --> 01:06:49.419
and I go on drinking water all the time to cool Myself, too.

01:07:00.111 --> 01:07:03.284
There are so many different forms of meditation.

01:07:03.484 --> 01:07:05.804
Does any sort of meditation work?

01:07:06.004 --> 01:07:09.223
No, no, it does not. We do not meditate,

01:07:09.424 --> 01:07:11.429
we have to be in meditation.

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:13.933
There’s difference between the two.

01:07:14.134 --> 01:07:16.824
You do not meditate before Realization;

01:07:17.024 --> 01:07:20.463
after Realization you are in meditation.

01:07:20.664 --> 01:07:22.964
So you become thoughtlessly aware.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:25.414
So when you meditate in Sahaja Yoga

01:07:25.614 --> 01:07:27.934
you become thoughtlessly aware,

01:07:28.134 --> 01:07:32.424
and then you start growing into a new awareness

01:07:32.624 --> 01:07:33.884
or a higher awareness

01:07:34.084 --> 01:07:37.003
which you call as doubtless awareness,

01:07:37.204 --> 01:07:39.344
and that is how you start growing.

01:07:39.544 --> 01:07:43.374
So the meditation is that you get into meditation,

01:07:43.574 --> 01:07:46.004
you don’t do meditation.

01:07:47.424 --> 01:07:48.863
This one.

01:07:49.064 --> 01:07:52.079
If you are one of these people that are thinking all the time

01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.312
and you are blocking up the other side,

01:07:54.513 --> 01:07:57.173
how do you balance [that]?

01:07:57.374 --> 01:08:01.974
If you are an excessive thinker, if you’re thinking all the time,

01:08:02.174 --> 01:08:04.724
and this causes a block on the opposite side,

01:08:04.924 --> 01:08:07.574
how are you balance things out?

01:08:08.834 --> 01:08:13.463
Just by, you see, turning your hand left to the right.

01:08:13.664 --> 01:08:15.703
It's very simple.

01:08:15.904 --> 01:08:19.404
You won’t believe, but that’s how we manage it.

01:08:24.444 --> 01:08:26.881
First the vibrations must flow from your hand,

01:08:27.082 --> 01:08:28.684
then you will know how to balance.

01:08:28.884 --> 01:08:30.924
But when that doesn’t happen,

01:08:31.124 --> 01:08:34.664
then you can ask somebody to balance you.

01:09:09.564 --> 01:09:12.533
It’s quite a big question.

01:09:14.196 --> 01:09:21.109
He says, You appear to be forming a hypothesis about Kundalini

01:09:21.310 --> 01:09:25.503
and relating it to medical conditions.

01:09:25.704 --> 01:09:28.393
From where does this hypothesis come?

01:09:28.594 --> 01:09:31.264
- Hypothesis?
- About Kundalini.

01:09:31.554 --> 01:09:33.933
Is My own knowledge.

01:09:34.134 --> 01:09:38.529
I have also done medicine, to relate it to that.

01:09:40.414 --> 01:09:42.254
Is My own knowledge, I should say,

01:09:42.464 --> 01:09:44.854
and so many saints had this knowledge too.

01:09:45.054 --> 01:09:47.974
But the only thing I have done is I have related

01:09:48.174 --> 01:09:51.363
to not only to medical, but also to science.

01:09:51.564 --> 01:09:54.124
That’s very important. Apart from that,

01:09:54.324 --> 01:09:57.613
I have devised a method, I would say,

01:09:57.814 --> 01:10:01.482
of permutations and combinations of human problems.

01:10:02.264 --> 01:10:05.134
I’ve studied them and worked it out in such a way

01:10:05.334 --> 01:10:08.484
that en masse Realization can be given.

01:10:09.734 --> 01:10:14.484
You see, I always try not to talk about Myself

01:10:14.685 --> 01:10:18.213
because, you see, Christ said that He was the Son of God

01:10:18.414 --> 01:10:22.634
which was the truth, truth, absolute truth,

01:10:22.835 --> 01:10:25.023
but people crucified Him for that.

01:10:25.224 --> 01:10:28.144
Because people don’t understand divine things,

01:10:28.354 --> 01:10:30.133
they don’t understand, you see;

01:10:30.334 --> 01:10:32.494
they have no idea as to the divine Power,

01:10:32.694 --> 01:10:33.977
what it can do.

01:10:34.178 --> 01:10:35.854
So they don’t understand,

01:10:36.054 --> 01:10:38.414
so no use telling them about yourself.

01:10:38.654 --> 01:10:41.254
As I told you, that I want to live,

01:10:41.454 --> 01:10:45.040
I don’t want to get crucified just now.

01:11:08.042 --> 01:11:09.801
So when you are meditating

01:11:10.002 --> 01:11:11.973
and you feel a force within you blooming,

01:11:12.174 --> 01:11:14.843
could You explain what this force is?

01:11:15.044 --> 01:11:17.174
- When you are meditating?
- Yes.

01:11:17.374 --> 01:11:20.958
Now which meditation she is doing, first of all, let’s know.

01:11:21.158 --> 01:11:24.377
- What kind of meditation are you doing?

01:11:24.726 --> 01:11:26.203
Chanting meditation.

01:11:26.404 --> 01:11:28.284
Chanting?

01:11:28.768 --> 01:11:33.304
Chanting is absolutely wrong. Absolutely wrong.

01:11:33.863 --> 01:11:36.584
Because if you are not connected,

01:11:36.784 --> 01:11:40.813
supposing you are taking the name of God, any way,

01:11:41.014 --> 01:11:43.763
and you are not connected,

01:11:43.964 --> 01:11:46.664
then what’s the use of taking the name?

01:11:46.864 --> 01:11:51.003
You are not connected. It’s like telephoning without connection.

01:11:51.204 --> 01:11:52.788
It’s very practical.

01:11:52.989 --> 01:11:56.524
Moreover, say, if you have to meet,

01:11:56.724 --> 01:11:58.134
say, the Queen of England,

01:11:58.334 --> 01:12:00.223
you have to have a protocol.

01:12:00.424 --> 01:12:03.504
You have to know her, you have to go by proper channel.

01:12:03.704 --> 01:12:06.541
You cannot just go and say, “Oh, Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth”.

01:12:06.742 --> 01:12:08.463
They’ll all arrest you there.

01:12:08.664 --> 01:12:11.243
And if you do chanting, then you get into troubles,

01:12:11.444 --> 01:12:13.223
terrible trouble.

01:12:13.424 --> 01:12:15.494
So you must have authority.

01:12:15.694 --> 01:12:17.333
God is not in your pocket,

01:12:17.534 --> 01:12:19.544
that you go on chanting His name all the time.

01:12:19.761 --> 01:12:22.699
But what you have to do is to

01:12:22.900 --> 01:12:25.084
be in His Kingdom;

01:12:25.294 --> 01:12:27.933
then even once if you take His name,

01:12:28.134 --> 01:12:30.709
you are blessed.

01:12:33.014 --> 01:12:37.534
Chanting is the most maddening thing, I think.

01:12:42.896 --> 01:12:47.086
There are a number of teachers, such as You say;

01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:53.959
they arrived to connect people to Divinity.

01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:56.909
On [unclear] born this divine time,

01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:59.762
what, how and what that relationship is

01:12:59.969 --> 01:13:03.952
between the teacher and those who do receive the connection?

01:13:04.153 --> 01:13:06.893
And whether it can be

01:13:07.094 --> 01:13:09.120
whether it needs to be just one teacher

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.129
or whether a number of teachers to be?

01:13:13.179 --> 01:13:16.053
Just stand before the light, I can't see.

01:13:16.384 --> 01:13:19.574
There is a number, he says there are a number of teachers

01:13:19.774 --> 01:13:23.284
who can make this connection for one with the Divinity.

01:13:23.564 --> 01:13:26.424
I have not known any, so far.

01:13:26.624 --> 01:13:28.174
I have not known any.

01:13:28.374 --> 01:13:31.844
They are all in the market and making money, that’s all.

01:13:32.044 --> 01:13:34.549
I would like to know if there’s somebody else.

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:37.489
But once you get your Realization,

01:13:37.690 --> 01:13:40.163
once you become a Sahaja Yogi,

01:13:40.364 --> 01:13:44.093
then you can give Realization to others. That’s different.

01:13:44.294 --> 01:13:48.084
But I have not known anyone so far who is doing this.

01:13:48.284 --> 01:13:51.482
If you know anyone, please let me know.

01:13:53.530 --> 01:13:56.394
What you see God as a [change]?

01:13:57.387 --> 01:13:58.487
Please translate.

01:13:58.688 --> 01:14:03.019
How do you see God, how do you describe God?

01:14:03.284 --> 01:14:06.004
Should I describe Him just now?

01:14:07.334 --> 01:14:09.632
It is, we should say that

01:14:09.832 --> 01:14:15.910
God is the one who is

01:14:19.054 --> 01:14:21.734
the Divinity, we can call it Divinity.

01:14:21.934 --> 01:14:25.004
And the Divinity becomes active.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:28.019
It sleeps, and then it becomes active.

01:14:28.219 --> 01:14:30.363
When it becomes active,

01:14:30.564 --> 01:14:35.053
then we say that God is now awakened.

01:14:35.254 --> 01:14:37.527
And when it is awakened,

01:14:37.728 --> 01:14:42.019
He separates Himself from His Power;

01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:45.584
and His Power is the Primordial Mother

01:14:45.784 --> 01:14:48.053
as we call Her, or the Holy Ghost.

01:14:48.254 --> 01:14:52.764
And He is watching the work of the Holy Ghost.

01:14:53.214 --> 01:14:56.253
She creates everything,

01:14:56.454 --> 01:14:59.844
She creates up to human beings,

01:15:00.334 --> 01:15:04.884
and it is He who is watching it. He is the spectator.

01:15:05.684 --> 01:15:07.453
There are many things can be said,

01:15:07.654 --> 01:15:11.184
because you see, God cannot be described in such a short time.

01:15:11.454 --> 01:15:13.364
But once you get your Realization

01:15:13.564 --> 01:15:16.534
you start understanding what is God Almighty

01:15:16.734 --> 01:15:18.109
and what is His Power.

01:15:18.310 --> 01:15:20.344
But first you must have the light.

01:15:20.544 --> 01:15:24.853
As I told you yesterday, now there are so many lights in this hall.

01:15:25.054 --> 01:15:26.604
Now if I start telling you

01:15:26.804 --> 01:15:29.514
about the origin of this light and electricity

01:15:29.714 --> 01:15:32.623
and how it came here and all that, it’s a headache.

01:15:32.824 --> 01:15:34.414
But what you have to do

01:15:34.614 --> 01:15:37.773
is to just put on one switch and it comes up.

01:15:37.974 --> 01:15:40.984
When you have the light, in that light if you see,

01:15:41.184 --> 01:15:44.223
this subtle knowledge will be easily understood.

01:15:44.424 --> 01:15:46.174
I am surprised that these people,

01:15:46.374 --> 01:15:49.373
who have never heard a name of Kundalini

01:15:49.574 --> 01:15:53.363
and who had no idea of Divinity also much,

01:15:53.564 --> 01:15:56.968
have become such experts in this knowledge, in such a short time,

01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:59.504
while it’s a very, very subtle knowledge.

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:03.173
So gradually you will know everything.

01:16:03.374 --> 01:16:06.227
First you get your Realization.

01:16:07.407 --> 01:16:09.083
Now, again.

01:16:09.284 --> 01:16:12.894
I just wanted to respond to what You said.

01:16:14.696 --> 01:16:17.728
The response we have among people is very similar

01:16:17.929 --> 01:16:19.654
to what You say, in terms of

01:16:19.854 --> 01:16:22.064
“I don’t know of anybody else who is able to…”

01:16:22.265 --> 01:16:24.623
- Really? That’s all right.
So what it is?

01:16:24.824 --> 01:16:28.210
Yes, I really, I must tell you that they,

01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:31.829
I think these people understood there’s a market,

01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:36.053
because, you see, this is a special category of people you are.

01:16:36.254 --> 01:16:38.604
It's a special category, it's already described

01:16:38.804 --> 01:16:42.443
as such a special category of people who will seek God

01:16:42.644 --> 01:16:45.363
- they are called as “men of God” by William Blake -

01:16:45.564 --> 01:16:47.035
will be on this Earth

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:51.634
and they will know God,

01:16:51.844 --> 01:16:54.304
also they will make others men of God.

01:16:54.504 --> 01:16:58.138
This is described. So many of them have prophesized like that.

01:16:58.812 --> 01:17:02.264
But when they came to know about that such a thing exists,

01:17:02.464 --> 01:17:04.904
they just started a market.

01:17:10.092 --> 01:17:14.730
I'm still confused. I have a connection with someone in India,

01:17:14.931 --> 01:17:18.654
by name [Shri Shritagu Balak Brahmachari]

01:17:18.854 --> 01:17:19.970
What is he saying?

01:17:20.171 --> 01:17:21.963
and he responds in a similar way.

01:17:22.164 --> 01:17:24.944
He has a connection with somebody in India

01:17:25.144 --> 01:17:27.404
who speaks in a similar way

01:17:27.604 --> 01:17:29.337
about these things to Yourself.

01:17:29.538 --> 01:17:33.944
He's confused as to who are the genuine and who are the...

01:17:34.174 --> 01:17:38.152
You see, the genuineness is first to apply one thing,

01:17:38.353 --> 01:17:40.255
does he take money, first?

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:43.023
Ninety-nine percent they’ll finished.

01:17:43.224 --> 01:17:47.324
Then you should say, does he give Realization to his disciples?

01:17:47.584 --> 01:17:50.104
You talk to the disciples. Have they got their Realization?

01:17:50.304 --> 01:17:52.013
Have they got any knowledge?

01:17:52.214 --> 01:17:54.364
They know the modus operandi or not?

01:17:54.564 --> 01:17:56.658
If they do not know, just

01:17:56.859 --> 01:17:59.254
they said, “Now, you are realized”, that’s not.

01:17:59.454 --> 01:18:00.914
They have to know each and everything.

01:18:01.115 --> 01:18:03.043
What is their depth of knowledge?

01:18:03.244 --> 01:18:06.273
First, as you go in the market, you see, find out

01:18:06.474 --> 01:18:09.303
so if somebody has purchased something, is it good,

01:18:09.504 --> 01:18:11.104
is really good, or not?

01:18:11.304 --> 01:18:14.404
In the same way when you are seeking something,

01:18:14.604 --> 01:18:17.333
you must first really with a free mind

01:18:17.534 --> 01:18:20.793
go and see the disciples, what have they got,

01:18:20.994 --> 01:18:22.723
what have they achieved,

01:18:22.924 --> 01:18:26.962
how are they, what sort of a life they are leading?

01:18:27.163 --> 01:18:30.204
It’s the best way if you want to really find out,

01:18:30.404 --> 01:18:33.083
it’s the best way to do that.

01:18:33.284 --> 01:18:36.143
You should not just blindly go to something,

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:39.123
and you should not just succumb to something

01:18:39.324 --> 01:18:40.512
because somebody says so.

01:18:40.713 --> 01:18:42.654
Even I, whatever I have said it,

01:18:42.855 --> 01:18:44.854
I said that you first experience.

01:18:45.084 --> 01:18:46.804
If you have the experience,

01:18:47.004 --> 01:18:48.904
then only you have to believe in yourself

01:18:49.104 --> 01:18:50.544
and you believe in Sahaja Yoga.

01:18:50.764 --> 01:18:54.024
Not before that. It’s a blindness.

01:18:54.225 --> 01:18:57.534
But you can't have the experience unless you have the connection.

01:18:57.735 --> 01:18:58.820
- What’s he saying?

01:18:59.021 --> 01:19:01.284
That's  what we are here for tonight to give you that thing.

01:19:01.484 --> 01:19:03.536
Of course, now I am going to do it.

01:19:03.737 --> 01:19:05.599
Just go on saying. Do you remember what people said?

01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:06.954
Please say that I would like to finish,

01:19:07.155 --> 01:19:09.807
- What’s he saying?
and just give me the experience.

01:19:10.683 --> 01:19:12.640
- Can I answer that Shri Mataji?
- Yes.

01:19:12.841 --> 01:19:15.404
- That is exactly what we will give you.

01:19:15.604 --> 01:19:17.965
You see, Shri Mataji will give you that experience

01:19:18.165 --> 01:19:21.373
and then you can make connections [to upon].

01:19:21.574 --> 01:19:24.933
You are making the connections through that experience.

01:19:25.134 --> 01:19:26.622
- All right.
- That's not something

01:19:26.822 --> 01:19:28.478
that you have to believe or something you will favour...

01:19:28.679 --> 01:19:29.764
No, no, no.

01:19:29.964 --> 01:19:32.523
No, no, no. Not at all it’s not thing like that.

01:19:32.724 --> 01:19:34.734
You have to certify yourself.

01:19:34.934 --> 01:19:36.264
Now the experience is

01:19:36.465 --> 01:19:37.943
that you feel the cool breeze

01:19:38.143 --> 01:19:41.193
coming out of your fontanel bone area

01:19:41.394 --> 01:19:43.093
yourself.

01:19:43.294 --> 01:19:47.334
And also you feel the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost all around you.

01:19:48.284 --> 01:19:51.259
This is to be certified by you only.

01:19:51.460 --> 01:19:54.254
But you should not also doubt yourself.

01:19:54.454 --> 01:19:55.964
Even so many feel, they'll say,

01:19:56.164 --> 01:19:59.174
“This is due to this air-conditioning.”

01:19:59.384 --> 01:20:02.583
Then they go home, close the windows, close the doors,

01:20:02.784 --> 01:20:05.093
make it hermetically sealed. Still they feel.

01:20:05.294 --> 01:20:07.787
Then they say, “Now what is this?”

01:20:08.251 --> 01:20:10.764
So doubting up to a point is sensible,

01:20:10.964 --> 01:20:12.555
but if you go beyond that

01:20:12.756 --> 01:20:15.231
then it’s harmful to you, not to anyone.

01:20:15.432 --> 01:20:18.978
Because I don’t need Sahaja Yoga, you need it.

01:20:21.294 --> 01:20:23.203
You need it.

01:20:23.404 --> 01:20:26.654
You want it, you have to ask for it.

01:20:27.294 --> 01:20:30.824
I cannot force on you. No, no, no way I can force you.

01:20:31.138 --> 01:20:34.053
You have to say “I want my Self-Realization.”

01:20:34.254 --> 01:20:36.005
In your freedom you have to ask,

01:20:36.206 --> 01:20:39.624
otherwise I cannot force. It cannot be forced.

01:20:40.572 --> 01:20:44.174
Now one more question and then we will start the...

01:20:44.574 --> 01:20:46.551
See person [started].

01:20:51.522 --> 01:20:52.844
I'm sorry.

01:20:53.045 --> 01:20:57.622
Can healing capacity is aligned to ayurvedic medicine?

01:20:57.823 --> 01:20:59.796
So is usual...

01:20:59.996 --> 01:21:04.264
Is the healing capacity of Sahaja Yoga

01:21:04.464 --> 01:21:07.264
aligned to ayurvedic medicine?

01:21:07.464 --> 01:21:09.154
What medicine?

01:21:09.364 --> 01:21:13.983
Is the ability of Sahaja Yoga to heal

01:21:14.184 --> 01:21:16.923
in any way connected with ayurvedic medicine?

01:21:17.124 --> 01:21:20.014
Of course. There are two doctors

01:21:20.214 --> 01:21:23.533
who have got their M.D. in Delhi,

01:21:23.734 --> 01:21:24.974
in Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:25.174 --> 01:21:27.840
They have shown how certain diseases are cured.

01:21:28.041 --> 01:21:30.763
They have taken three, four diseases, each person;

01:21:30.964 --> 01:21:32.372
Now there’s third one who’s doing.

01:21:32.573 --> 01:21:34.526
And there are seven doctors in London

01:21:34.726 --> 01:21:36.403
who are doing experiments.

01:21:36.604 --> 01:21:38.524
I mean, they are just trying to document it.

01:21:38.724 --> 01:21:40.384
Those people have been cured.

01:21:40.584 --> 01:21:45.574
There are people, like blood cancers, nephritis, myelitis,

01:21:45.774 --> 01:21:47.933
all kinds of people have been cured,

01:21:48.134 --> 01:21:50.374
So they are trying to document it.

01:21:50.574 --> 01:21:53.213
We have two hundred no, how many?

01:21:53.413 --> 01:21:56.083
Four hundred doctors in Russia

01:21:56.284 --> 01:21:58.223
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:58.479 --> 01:22:00.424
It’s all related to it.

01:22:01.224 --> 01:22:03.504
Because this is a new science, we can call it,

01:22:03.704 --> 01:22:06.493
this is Meta-modernism,

01:22:06.694 --> 01:22:09.823
when people are seeing something higher.

01:22:10.024 --> 01:22:12.374
It is working out.

01:22:13.861 --> 01:22:14.964
But that doesn’t mean

01:22:15.165 --> 01:22:17.027
that we’ll take away all the practice of doctors.

01:22:17.228 --> 01:22:18.865
They should not be afraid of it.

01:22:19.065 --> 01:22:21.703
Because, you see,

01:22:21.904 --> 01:22:25.183
we can only help people who get Realization,

01:22:25.384 --> 01:22:27.814
not the people who do not get Realization.

01:22:28.024 --> 01:22:31.463
Those people who do not get Realization, we cannot help them.

01:22:31.664 --> 01:22:35.064
So it is a by-product of your Realization.

01:22:45.574 --> 01:22:49.534
Reincarnation, Shri Mataji. What are Your thoughts he's asking.

01:22:49.804 --> 01:22:53.804
Reincarnation. What are Your thoughts on reincarnation?

01:22:55.144 --> 01:22:59.124
You do reincarnate, no doubt, you do.

01:22:59.515 --> 01:23:01.284
But you should not believe whatever I say.

01:23:01.485 --> 01:23:03.242
Why should you believe that?

01:23:03.443 --> 01:23:06.533
Because I am saying that? You should find out yourself.

01:23:06.734 --> 01:23:08.544
You can find out in Sahaja Yoga

01:23:08.744 --> 01:23:11.614
whatever I say is true or not.

01:23:14.536 --> 01:23:16.574
Whatever I say

01:23:17.794 --> 01:23:20.764
is for you to judge later on.

01:23:22.744 --> 01:23:25.924
It’s all absolutely open.

01:23:32.724 --> 01:23:36.657
The biggest thing that Sahaja Yoga has achieved, I feel,

01:23:36.858 --> 01:23:38.643
more than medical,

01:23:38.844 --> 01:23:44.404
is that they are absolutely free of addictions.

01:23:45.414 --> 01:23:47.523
People who came to Me

01:23:47.724 --> 01:23:54.753
were so addicted to such horrible type of drugs,

01:23:54.954 --> 01:23:57.723
that when they came they couldn’t see Me even.

01:23:57.924 --> 01:23:59.844
They were like coma patients.

01:24:00.045 --> 01:24:02.383
And overnight they gave it up.

01:24:02.584 --> 01:24:05.784
This is the biggest achievement today, I think.

01:24:08.224 --> 01:24:10.683
And I feel very gratified for that,

01:24:10.884 --> 01:24:13.664
because you must have heard how even small children

01:24:13.864 --> 01:24:16.734
below twelve years of age in England,

01:24:17.074 --> 01:24:20.449
in one part of England, in the southern part,

01:24:20.649 --> 01:24:22.044
are taking drugs,

01:24:22.245 --> 01:24:25.014
which is such a dangerous thing.

01:24:31.248 --> 01:24:34.463
Because you become absolutely free,

01:24:34.664 --> 01:24:38.694
and capable of asserting your freedom.

01:24:42.964 --> 01:24:47.984
Should we now have our Self-Realization, all of us?

01:25:03.009 --> 01:25:05.566
Before we start,

01:25:05.766 --> 01:25:10.844
I have to request you to take out your shoes,

01:25:11.044 --> 01:25:14.384
because this Mother Earth helps us a lot.

01:25:29.509 --> 01:25:32.075
Not working?

01:25:32.275 --> 01:25:34.544
All right.

01:25:35.347 --> 01:25:37.323
Now, it's all right.

01:25:37.524 --> 01:25:41.154
Connections, you see, that’s the point!

01:25:45.584 --> 01:25:48.424
Now there are two conditions

01:25:49.624 --> 01:25:52.129
which you have to accept.

01:25:52.834 --> 01:25:58.050
First one is that at this moment you forget the past.

01:25:58.251 --> 01:26:01.050
Absolutely,

01:26:02.584 --> 01:26:05.485
you should know that

01:26:05.739 --> 01:26:09.683
you have no business to condemn yourself,

01:26:11.935 --> 01:26:16.887
that you are not guilty at all of anything.

01:26:17.304 --> 01:26:20.183
If you feel guilty,

01:26:20.384 --> 01:26:22.974
then it’s another myth.

01:26:24.784 --> 01:26:27.413
And at this time

01:26:27.614 --> 01:26:30.903
you have to know this All-pervading Power

01:26:31.104 --> 01:26:33.643
is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:26:33.844 --> 01:26:36.884
and you cannot commit any mistakes

01:26:37.084 --> 01:26:40.343
which cannot be completely dissolved by this Power.

01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:43.095
So have confidence in yourself, please.

01:26:43.296 --> 01:26:45.684
These are very important conditions.

01:26:45.934 --> 01:26:47.664
Yesterday I met all of you,

01:26:47.864 --> 01:26:50.677
but today I may not be able to meet you all.

01:26:51.284 --> 01:26:54.974
At least those whom I’ve met yesterday must have noticed that

01:26:55.344 --> 01:26:59.663
I had to really correct them on these two points.

01:26:59.864 --> 01:27:03.204
So please help Me, cooperate.

01:27:04.574 --> 01:27:10.093
Then secondly, the second condition is very simple,

01:27:10.294 --> 01:27:13.083
if you understand

01:27:13.284 --> 01:27:20.496
that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

01:27:20.697 --> 01:27:24.416
Because logically, whether you forgive or don’t forgive,

01:27:24.617 --> 01:27:27.581
you don’t do anything. Logically, think about it.

01:27:27.782 --> 01:27:29.601
You don’t do anything,

01:27:29.802 --> 01:27:32.963
whether we forgive or we don’t forgive.

01:27:33.164 --> 01:27:35.752
But if we don’t forgive,

01:27:35.953 --> 01:27:38.601
then we play into wrong hands.

01:27:38.802 --> 01:27:42.534
The people who have tortured us or troubled us or hurt us

01:27:42.734 --> 01:27:44.855
are quite happy, but we are the ones,

01:27:45.056 --> 01:27:48.433
by not forgiving are suffering.

01:27:48.633 --> 01:27:50.288
Now some people say it’s very difficult,

01:27:50.489 --> 01:27:52.203
but it is just a myth,

01:27:52.404 --> 01:27:54.904
it’s just a bubble in your head.

01:27:55.504 --> 01:27:57.494
So just forgive all of them, once for all.

01:27:57.694 --> 01:28:00.144
I told yesterday those people who were not forgiving,

01:28:00.344 --> 01:28:01.604
they got their Realization,

01:28:01.804 --> 01:28:04.534
“Tell all the flowers, all the trees and everyone,

01:28:04.734 --> 01:28:06.364
loudly".

01:28:06.774 --> 01:28:08.844
Don’t think about them also individually.

01:28:09.044 --> 01:28:13.177
Just say “All of them I have forgiven, in general”.

01:28:13.764 --> 01:28:18.084
It’s such a relief. Immediately you’ll feel the relief on your head.

01:28:18.704 --> 01:28:21.564
It’s very important to forgive.

01:28:23.604 --> 01:28:26.164
And that you must have full confidence

01:28:26.365 --> 01:28:30.107
that you are all human beings, and you all are capable

01:28:30.308 --> 01:28:32.884
of getting Self-Realization.

01:28:34.254 --> 01:28:36.503
And “I will get my Realization”,

01:28:36.718 --> 01:28:40.170
that should be your

01:28:42.015 --> 01:28:46.749
full self-confidence. That is going to help us.

01:28:49.164 --> 01:28:52.504
Now as I have told you, that there’s left and right, two energies.

01:28:52.704 --> 01:28:57.983
The left is the energy of mundane desires,

01:28:58.184 --> 01:29:00.424
everyday desires, not the pure desire.

01:29:00.624 --> 01:29:03.864
And the right is the energy of action.

01:29:04.814 --> 01:29:08.363
So you please put both your feet

01:29:08.564 --> 01:29:12.044
little apart from each other, who are sitting on the chairs.

01:29:12.244 --> 01:29:14.481
Who are sitting on the ground are perfectly all right.

01:29:14.682 --> 01:29:16.663
They don’t have to worry.

01:29:16.864 --> 01:29:21.264
Now, please put your left hand towards Me.

01:29:22.414 --> 01:29:23.604
This is symbolic

01:29:23.804 --> 01:29:26.424
that you really want your Self-Realization.

01:29:27.164 --> 01:29:30.684
Those who do not want to have, I cannot force it on them

01:29:30.884 --> 01:29:32.864
and they should

01:29:33.974 --> 01:29:37.783
in all civility leave the hall,

01:29:37.984 --> 01:29:40.853
because they can disturb others’ ascent.

01:29:41.054 --> 01:29:44.000
So to be civil to others, they should leave the hall.

01:29:44.201 --> 01:29:47.044
But those who want to have their Self-Realization

01:29:47.244 --> 01:29:50.656
have to do this much, is

01:29:51.574 --> 01:29:54.462
to do what I’m telling you;

01:29:54.677 --> 01:29:59.836
and hardly ten minutes will take

01:30:00.037 --> 01:30:02.523
to have your Self-Realization.

01:30:02.724 --> 01:30:04.584
So just left hand towards Me,

01:30:04.785 --> 01:30:06.512
the right hand is to be used

01:30:06.713 --> 01:30:10.713
for nourishing your different centers.

01:30:10.914 --> 01:30:15.428
So you put first your right hand on your heart.

01:30:18.654 --> 01:30:24.194
This is the center of the Spirit.

01:30:24.404 --> 01:30:27.423
The Spirit resides in your heart,

01:30:27.624 --> 01:30:32.026
but its seat is here; but it resides in your heart.

01:30:33.484 --> 01:30:36.393
It resides in your heart.

01:30:36.594 --> 01:30:38.664
Then you take down your right hand

01:30:38.864 --> 01:30:41.724
in the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:30:43.284 --> 01:30:47.923
This is the center of your mastery,

01:30:48.124 --> 01:30:51.966
which has been created by great masters and prophets.

01:30:53.164 --> 01:30:55.128
Then you take down your right hand

01:30:55.329 --> 01:30:58.224
in the lower portion of your abdomen.

01:30:59.764 --> 01:31:03.522
This is the center of pure knowledge,

01:31:03.722 --> 01:31:05.403
absolute knowledge;

01:31:05.604 --> 01:31:08.604
knowledge about the divine powers,

01:31:08.804 --> 01:31:11.574
its laws, which work through your being.

01:31:11.774 --> 01:31:13.374
You don’t have to know mentally,

01:31:13.574 --> 01:31:16.803
but they are manifested through your being

01:31:17.004 --> 01:31:18.623
pure knowledge.

01:31:18.824 --> 01:31:20.987
As you can see Me,

01:31:21.187 --> 01:31:23.383
as you can feel something,

01:31:23.584 --> 01:31:27.584
in the same way, this pure knowledge works through you.

01:31:29.224 --> 01:31:33.089
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

01:31:36.934 --> 01:31:39.838
Then again on your heart.

01:31:41.164 --> 01:31:44.761
Then in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, as I told you,

01:31:44.962 --> 01:31:47.724
that when you feel guilty this center goes out of order,

01:31:47.924 --> 01:31:51.304
and turn your head to your right, completely.

01:31:54.504 --> 01:31:56.383
Here is the center where

01:31:56.584 --> 01:31:59.094
you have to forgive yourself completely,

01:31:59.294 --> 01:32:02.494
and to know that you are not guilty at all.

01:32:06.584 --> 01:32:11.203
Now take your right hand on your forehand across,

01:32:11.404 --> 01:32:16.164
like this, and gently put down your head as far as possible,

01:32:16.384 --> 01:32:18.724
resting on your hand.

01:32:20.274 --> 01:32:21.654
This is the center

01:32:21.855 --> 01:32:26.029
where you have to forgive everyone in general.

01:32:29.254 --> 01:32:32.701
Now you have to take your right hand on the back side of your head,

01:32:32.901 --> 01:32:34.279
back side of your head,

01:32:34.480 --> 01:32:37.453
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:32:37.654 --> 01:32:41.091
Push it back as far as possible.

01:32:43.644 --> 01:32:48.084
This is the center where, without feeling guilty,

01:32:48.284 --> 01:32:50.464
without counting your mistakes

01:32:50.664 --> 01:32:55.496
you have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power.

01:32:56.364 --> 01:32:59.944
Now stretch your palm. I’m just telling you how to do it;

01:33:00.144 --> 01:33:02.334
then later on we’ll do it in a proper way.

01:33:02.534 --> 01:33:05.153
Now stretch your palm fully,

01:33:05.353 --> 01:33:09.560
and put the center of your palm

01:33:09.761 --> 01:33:12.563
exactly on the fontanel bone area,

01:33:12.764 --> 01:33:15.984
which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:20.844
Now please put down your head as far as possible,

01:33:21.454 --> 01:33:22.950
please put it down,

01:33:23.151 --> 01:33:29.093
and now start moving your scalp.

01:33:29.294 --> 01:33:32.054
Push back your fingers, otherwise there’s no proper pressure.

01:33:32.255 --> 01:33:34.444
Please push back your fingers nicely.

01:33:34.644 --> 01:33:37.463
Now move your scalp with that pressure

01:33:37.664 --> 01:33:39.933
not the hand so much as the scalp

01:33:40.134 --> 01:33:42.364
seven times, clockwise.

01:33:42.584 --> 01:33:45.823
Put down your head please, push back your fingers,

01:33:46.024 --> 01:33:50.764
and move your scalp slowly seven times.

01:33:54.064 --> 01:33:56.270
Very slowly,

01:33:59.315 --> 01:34:01.754
with a proper pressure.

01:34:15.803 --> 01:34:19.291
Done. That’s all we have to do.

01:34:19.492 --> 01:34:22.974
Now I will request you to take out your spectacles

01:34:23.174 --> 01:34:25.463
because you have to close your eyes,

01:34:25.664 --> 01:34:30.464
and till I tell you, please don’t open your eyes.

01:34:31.734 --> 01:34:35.632
Move your legs apart from each other,

01:34:35.833 --> 01:34:41.603
and please put your left hand towards Me

01:34:41.804 --> 01:34:44.503
and right hand on your heart,

01:34:44.704 --> 01:34:48.404
and now, if there is anything

01:34:48.604 --> 01:34:52.199
that is tight on your neck or on your waist,

01:34:52.400 --> 01:34:57.171
please reduce the pressure, be comfortable,

01:34:57.372 --> 01:35:01.758
sit straight, not too much bending or bending back

01:35:01.959 --> 01:35:05.794
but in a comfortable way, in a very comfortable way.

01:35:06.064 --> 01:35:10.716
Now, you have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:35:13.724 --> 01:35:18.013
Now, please put your right hand on your heart.

01:35:35.690 --> 01:35:37.545
Here you have to ask Me

01:35:37.746 --> 01:35:41.014
a very fundamental question about yourself,

01:35:41.938 --> 01:35:45.044
because I told you, you have to become a divine computer.

01:35:45.244 --> 01:35:47.704
So first you use Me for that.

01:35:47.904 --> 01:35:50.774
Now ask a question, in your heart -

01:35:50.974 --> 01:35:54.894
you can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother” whatever you like -

01:35:55.294 --> 01:35:57.294
ask a question three times,

01:35:57.504 --> 01:36:00.934
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask sincerely.

01:36:01.134 --> 01:36:04.785
“Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask three times.

01:36:25.041 --> 01:36:27.699
Now,

01:36:33.624 --> 01:36:36.214
if you are the Spirit,

01:36:36.414 --> 01:36:37.964
you are your master,

01:36:38.164 --> 01:36:41.571
because in that light you know,

01:36:41.772 --> 01:36:44.163
what is right, what is wrong,

01:36:44.364 --> 01:36:46.404
and you become your own guide.

01:36:46.614 --> 01:36:47.984
So now put your right hand

01:36:48.184 --> 01:36:50.814
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

01:36:51.014 --> 01:36:53.757
We are only working on the left-hand side.

01:36:53.958 --> 01:36:56.803
Press it hard. And here

01:36:57.004 --> 01:37:00.446
you ask another question three times,

01:37:00.677 --> 01:37:05.504
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:37:05.704 --> 01:37:08.053
Ask this question three times,

01:37:08.484 --> 01:37:12.864
“Mother, am I my own master?”

01:37:15.164 --> 01:37:20.903
I have already told you that I respect your freedom.

01:37:21.104 --> 01:37:25.913
I cannot force pure knowledge upon you.

01:37:27.574 --> 01:37:29.923
So now please put your right hand

01:37:30.124 --> 01:37:32.963
in the lower portion of your abdomen.

01:37:33.224 --> 01:37:40.317
Here you have to ask, three times,

01:37:41.774 --> 01:37:43.942
six times, because this petal,

01:37:44.142 --> 01:37:47.333
this, this center has got six petals.

01:37:47.534 --> 01:37:50.694
Please ask six times,

01:37:51.644 --> 01:37:57.724
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

01:37:57.924 --> 01:37:59.694
Please say that six times,

01:37:59.894 --> 01:38:03.044
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

01:38:03.244 --> 01:38:07.663
Say it in humility; you are asking for the highest.

01:38:07.864 --> 01:38:10.764
Six times, please.

01:38:32.224 --> 01:38:35.243
When you ask for pure knowledge

01:38:35.444 --> 01:38:38.163
your Kundalini starts rising.

01:38:38.364 --> 01:38:41.254
So we have to clear our upper centers

01:38:41.454 --> 01:38:45.553
with our self-confidence.

01:38:45.754 --> 01:38:47.084
So raise your right hand

01:38:47.285 --> 01:38:49.964
in the upper portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand side,

01:38:50.164 --> 01:38:52.254
and here you press it hard

01:38:52.455 --> 01:38:58.083
and say with full confidence ten times, ten times,

01:38:58.284 --> 01:39:01.864
“Mother, I am my own master”.

01:39:02.064 --> 01:39:05.173
“Mother, I am my own master”.

01:39:05.374 --> 01:39:07.174
Please say.

01:39:09.944 --> 01:39:12.484
Ten times.

01:39:26.134 --> 01:39:27.494
As I told you

01:39:27.694 --> 01:39:32.284
that you are not this body, this mind, this ego,

01:39:32.484 --> 01:39:34.513
these conditionings,

01:39:34.714 --> 01:39:39.921
but you are the pure Spirit.

01:39:40.843 --> 01:39:46.304
So now please raise your right hand on your heart.

01:39:47.334 --> 01:39:51.964
Here now, say with full confidence, twelve times,

01:39:52.204 --> 01:39:55.584
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:39:55.794 --> 01:39:58.504
Please say it twelve times,

01:39:58.724 --> 01:40:02.983
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:40:03.184 --> 01:40:06.440
Please put your hand on your heart.

01:40:09.334 --> 01:40:11.643
This divine Power,

01:40:11.844 --> 01:40:14.853
is the ocean of knowledge,

01:40:15.054 --> 01:40:19.452
is the ocean of love, compassion and bliss;

01:40:19.653 --> 01:40:23.884
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness,

01:40:24.174 --> 01:40:26.764
and you can not commit any mistakes

01:40:26.974 --> 01:40:29.668
which cannot be dissolved

01:40:29.869 --> 01:40:34.273
by this great power of forgiveness.

01:40:35.434 --> 01:40:37.823
So please forgive yourself,

01:40:38.024 --> 01:40:42.294
and put your hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

01:40:42.494 --> 01:40:45.053
and turn your head to your right.

01:40:45.254 --> 01:40:47.648
Here, please help Me,

01:40:47.849 --> 01:40:50.164
by saying with full confidence,

01:40:50.364 --> 01:40:54.239
“Mother, I am not guilty at all”.

01:40:54.440 --> 01:40:58.666
Just say that, with full confidence, please.

01:41:10.814 --> 01:41:14.465
You have to say that, please,

01:41:14.666 --> 01:41:17.340
sixteen times.

01:41:22.291 --> 01:41:24.343
I have already told you

01:41:24.544 --> 01:41:28.629
that if you forgive or don’t forgive,

01:41:28.830 --> 01:41:32.398
you do not do anything. It’s a myth,

01:41:32.599 --> 01:41:33.781
absolute myth.

01:41:33.982 --> 01:41:35.933
But if you don’t forgive,

01:41:36.134 --> 01:41:40.903
then you play into wrong hands and torture yourself.

01:41:41.104 --> 01:41:43.187
So give up this myth, once for all,

01:41:43.388 --> 01:41:45.644
just give up this myth!

01:41:46.254 --> 01:41:48.746
Now raise your right hand

01:41:48.947 --> 01:41:52.070
onto your forehead across,

01:41:52.271 --> 01:41:56.615
and put down your head as far as possible.

01:41:57.624 --> 01:42:03.214
Now, here, you have to say, not how many times but with

01:42:04.994 --> 01:42:07.363
your heart in it.

01:42:07.578 --> 01:42:09.843
Say it,

01:42:10.044 --> 01:42:16.263
“Mother, I forgive everyone in general.”

01:42:16.464 --> 01:42:18.834
Just say that,

01:42:21.394 --> 01:42:24.254
from your heart.

01:42:43.674 --> 01:42:48.793
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head,

01:42:48.994 --> 01:42:53.284
and push back your head as far as possible.

01:42:57.264 --> 01:42:59.074
Here,

01:43:01.454 --> 01:43:03.384
without feeling guilty,

01:43:03.584 --> 01:43:05.244
without counting your mistakes,

01:43:05.444 --> 01:43:07.424
just for your satisfaction,

01:43:08.044 --> 01:43:10.193
you have to say

01:43:10.394 --> 01:43:13.904
from your heart, not how many times,

01:43:14.724 --> 01:43:16.394
“Oh divine Power,

01:43:16.594 --> 01:43:20.002
if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly,

01:43:20.203 --> 01:43:22.124
please forgive me”.

01:43:22.714 --> 01:43:24.504
Say it from your heart,

01:43:24.704 --> 01:43:26.154
“Oh divine Power,

01:43:26.354 --> 01:43:31.170
if I have done anything, against you or any mistakes,

01:43:31.371 --> 01:43:33.463
please forgive me”.

01:43:33.664 --> 01:43:37.084
That’s all you have to say, from your heart.

01:43:38.264 --> 01:43:41.934
Stretch back your head, fully.

01:43:49.554 --> 01:43:53.484
Now, stretch your hand fully.

01:44:12.174 --> 01:44:16.364
And put the center of your palm

01:44:16.564 --> 01:44:21.533
on top of your fontanel bone area,

01:44:21.734 --> 01:44:26.296
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:44:37.164 --> 01:44:43.305
Now, bend your head as far as possible.

01:44:44.914 --> 01:44:48.138
Now, push back your fingers,

01:44:48.338 --> 01:44:51.774
to have a good pressure on your scalp.

01:44:52.814 --> 01:44:55.853
Here again, I cannot force

01:44:56.054 --> 01:45:00.093
Self-Realization on you, I cannot force.

01:45:00.294 --> 01:45:03.633
So you have to ask for it.

01:45:03.834 --> 01:45:08.594
Now move your scalp slowly, seven times,

01:45:10.154 --> 01:45:12.223
saying seven times,

01:45:12.424 --> 01:45:15.924
“Mother, please give me Self-Realization”,

01:45:16.154 --> 01:45:18.374
saying seven times,

01:45:18.574 --> 01:45:22.654
“Mother, please give me Self-Realization”.

01:46:12.014 --> 01:46:14.739
Please open your eyes, slowly.

01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:18.017
Put down your hands.

01:46:19.987 --> 01:46:24.254
Now please put both your hands towards Me, like this.

01:46:28.372 --> 01:46:33.083
Put your right hand towards Me, like this,

01:46:33.284 --> 01:46:36.213
and now put down your head,

01:46:36.414 --> 01:46:40.333
and see if you are getting yourself

01:46:40.534 --> 01:46:45.476
a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area.

01:46:45.677 --> 01:46:48.060
Just see for yourself.

01:46:49.294 --> 01:46:53.214
Now don’t put the hand on top of your head, but away from it.

01:46:53.414 --> 01:46:56.724
And sometimes you might get it much further.

01:46:56.924 --> 01:47:00.334
You can also move your hand to see

01:47:00.944 --> 01:47:03.943
if there’s a cool breeze coming out of your head.

01:47:04.144 --> 01:47:08.204
Now don’t doubt about the air-conditioner,

01:47:08.404 --> 01:47:11.727
because it’s coming out of your head.

01:47:13.874 --> 01:47:16.656
Now,

01:47:17.224 --> 01:47:20.384
put your left hand towards Me,

01:47:23.164 --> 01:47:26.263
and put down your head.

01:47:26.464 --> 01:47:29.884
And now see with your right hand, right hand,

01:47:30.084 --> 01:47:34.444
if you are getting a cool or a hot breeze

01:47:34.644 --> 01:47:38.515
out of your fontanel bone area.

01:47:42.944 --> 01:47:45.684
Now, again put your right hand towards Me,

01:47:45.884 --> 01:47:47.794
right hand like this.

01:47:48.294 --> 01:47:50.032
Put down your head.

01:47:50.262 --> 01:47:53.093
See for last time, see clearly,

01:47:53.294 --> 01:47:57.143
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze

01:47:57.344 --> 01:47:59.565
may be slight, might be more coming.

01:47:59.765 --> 01:48:01.523
Don’t get confused.

01:48:01.724 --> 01:48:04.975
See for yourself, your attention.

01:48:05.181 --> 01:48:07.490
It’s coming out.

01:48:09.964 --> 01:48:13.143
Now put both the hands towards Me like this,

01:48:13.344 --> 01:48:15.684
and watch Me without thinking.

01:48:15.884 --> 01:48:19.418
You will see that there’s no thought in your mind.

01:48:22.884 --> 01:48:25.653
Now raise both your hands

01:48:25.854 --> 01:48:28.628
towards the sky like this,

01:48:30.444 --> 01:48:33.624
and ask another fundamental question,

01:48:33.824 --> 01:48:36.438
“Mother, is this the...

01:48:36.645 --> 01:48:40.255
Mother is this the breeze,

01:48:42.914 --> 01:48:46.844
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:48:49.024 --> 01:48:50.884
"Mother,

01:48:51.944 --> 01:48:56.773
is this the All-pervading Power of divine love?

01:48:56.974 --> 01:49:00.304
Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya?”

01:49:00.534 --> 01:49:02.664
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:49:02.864 --> 01:49:05.253
Put back your head completely.

01:49:05.454 --> 01:49:08.224
Push back your head completely,

01:49:08.464 --> 01:49:13.104
and ask this question, anyone of them, three times.

01:49:15.854 --> 01:49:17.440
Now take down your hands.

01:49:17.640 --> 01:49:20.377
Such flowing of vibrations!

01:49:25.934 --> 01:49:30.994
All those who have felt cool breeze on your fingertips,

01:49:31.284 --> 01:49:33.093
in your hands,

01:49:33.293 --> 01:49:38.873
or on top of your fontanel bone area,

01:49:39.074 --> 01:49:40.705
please raise both your hands.

01:49:40.906 --> 01:49:43.547
Please raise both your hands.

01:49:49.754 --> 01:49:52.564
May God bless you all.

01:49:54.524 --> 01:49:56.104
May God bless you all.

01:49:56.304 --> 01:49:58.233
Now you should know, it has not happened

01:49:58.434 --> 01:50:00.364
through any mental activity.

01:50:00.614 --> 01:50:03.064
So you cannot argue it out, you cannot discuss it,

01:50:03.264 --> 01:50:05.564
but you have to just feel it and grow into it.

01:50:05.794 --> 01:50:08.433
Another thing I would suggest that

01:50:08.634 --> 01:50:12.344
it’s not an individual procedure,

01:50:12.544 --> 01:50:15.484
it’s a collective procedure, it’s a collective thing.

01:50:15.684 --> 01:50:19.204
Like one nail, which falls out of your body,

01:50:19.404 --> 01:50:21.333
it’s not looked after. In the same way,

01:50:21.534 --> 01:50:24.284
if you say that “I am doing it at home, Mother, it’s all right”,

01:50:24.484 --> 01:50:27.393
that’s not the thing. You have to come to our collective.

01:50:27.594 --> 01:50:31.674
And we have a very nice collective arrangements here

01:50:31.904 --> 01:50:33.296
where you can come,

01:50:33.497 --> 01:50:35.513
and you can tell your problems,

01:50:35.714 --> 01:50:37.704
and you can master this art,

01:50:37.904 --> 01:50:39.324
absolutely master.

01:50:39.524 --> 01:50:42.474
I hope next year I’ll come to Melbourne

01:50:42.674 --> 01:50:44.804
and I’ll find lots of people

01:50:45.094 --> 01:50:47.254
who have achieved this mastery.

01:50:47.454 --> 01:50:49.524
I bless you all from My heart.

01:50:49.794 --> 01:50:51.924
Those who have not felt cool breeze

01:50:52.124 --> 01:50:53.364
can come on this side.

01:50:53.565 --> 01:50:55.564
So I may not be able to meet all of you,

01:50:55.764 --> 01:50:58.544
though I wanted very much to meet all of you today again,

01:50:58.744 --> 01:51:02.854
but we’ll have some music for you to enjoy. Please!

01:51:06.254 --> 01:51:08.094
Just....

01:51:13.938 --> 01:51:15.375
Sit down. Yes.

01:51:15.587 --> 01:51:17.754
Make a... We have a special announcement to make.

01:51:17.955 --> 01:51:20.415
So please, please.

01:51:28.113 --> 01:51:30.386
She wants what?

01:51:30.965 --> 01:51:32.590
I will follow.

01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:34.287
Water, all right, please come.

01:51:34.488 --> 01:51:37.305
Give her some. Is there any other glass?

01:51:38.095 --> 01:51:41.833
Some other glass. Just put some other glass, please.

01:51:44.974 --> 01:51:48.474
It’s difficult for Me.  It’s all right for a child.

01:52:14.652 --> 01:52:17.179
So, yes, how are you?

01:52:17.398 --> 01:52:20.783
Mother, they came for Sahaja Yoga in July,

01:52:20.983 --> 01:52:23.051
- They are here.
- Who?

01:52:23.274 --> 01:52:26.215
There is one with wheelchair and the one behind.

01:52:26.415 --> 01:52:28.501
- She's all right?
- Yes, she's there.

01:52:28.714 --> 01:52:31.427
- Ah, She is the one?
- The young, the young one there.

01:52:31.628 --> 01:52:34.424
- Yes, really! What trouble they had?

01:52:34.624 --> 01:52:36.244
That one was paralyzed.

01:52:36.444 --> 01:52:39.154
Now she can move left hand and the [right foot]...

01:52:39.444 --> 01:52:44.647
Amjad! Amjad! Doctor Amjad Ali, please come along.

01:52:45.203 --> 01:52:47.846
Are you here?

01:52:48.494 --> 01:52:49.980
We will just talk to them,

01:52:50.180 --> 01:52:51.823
and he has to take their,

01:52:52.024 --> 01:52:54.801
they must be having their medical reports.

01:52:55.008 --> 01:52:56.712
No, they haven't, because they live,

01:52:56.913 --> 01:53:00.519
that one, she lives in nursing house where is no doctor.

01:53:00.720 --> 01:53:03.592
They look after [unclear]. We do [unclear] and send to you

01:53:03.793 --> 01:53:05.237
- before nursing her.
- Yes.

01:53:05.438 --> 01:53:07.704
Here, they haven't, but everybody can see it.

01:53:07.905 --> 01:53:10.773
She is still in chair but she can move the left leg.

01:53:10.974 --> 01:53:14.054
So I think I’ll ask Amjad to file it,

01:53:14.254 --> 01:53:18.104
because we have to send certain documents

01:53:18.304 --> 01:53:19.860
of people being cured here.

01:53:20.060 --> 01:53:21.684
Yes, I'll take down.

01:53:21.885 --> 01:53:25.376
Yes, but I’ll tell Doctor Amjad to help you.

01:53:25.583 --> 01:53:28.259
But I go to bring Nirmala.

01:53:28.460 --> 01:53:30.313
I go to bring her here?

01:53:30.514 --> 01:53:33.651
Not necessary, it’s all right.

01:53:45.924 --> 01:53:48.410
Somebody is outside who is hurt,

01:53:48.611 --> 01:53:51.560
and the doctor is helping him at the moment.

01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:53.847
- Hurt what?
- [unclear]

01:53:54.048 --> 01:53:55.048
How?

01:53:55.249 --> 01:53:56.956
Like walking through the door and he had some glasses...

01:53:57.157 --> 01:53:59.273
and wearing the glasses and they [stepped] on that.

01:53:59.474 --> 01:54:02.484
Bring them here, I’ll cure.
