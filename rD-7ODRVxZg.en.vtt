WEBVTT

04:40.855 --> 04:45.744
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

04:51.800 --> 04:58.053
Just now, Albert has very clearly described to you

04:58.374 --> 05:01.755
the mechanism that is within us

05:01.955 --> 05:06.753
which works out our self-realization.

05:06.953 --> 05:10.636
There is a mechanism, no doubt.

05:11.566 --> 05:16.620
When we are in this room we see so many lights

05:16.820 --> 05:20.878
and there is a mechanism behind this.

05:21.078 --> 05:27.286
But what we do is to just switch on and the lights are there.

05:27.486 --> 05:31.870
So the whole mechanism is already built within us

05:32.070 --> 05:36.203
through our evolutionary process.

05:36.403 --> 05:42.079
Now we have reached at a point when we have to achieve

05:42.279 --> 05:46.453
the result of the evolutionary process.

05:46.653 --> 05:57.578
In the West, people had the quest to find out outside this body.

05:57.778 --> 06:07.495
I would say that they tried to find out the knowledge

06:07.695 --> 06:14.662
about the tree of life, but when the life is found out

06:14.862 --> 06:18.578
from outside you can go up to a point,

06:18.778 --> 06:22.370
and the tree can also grow up to a point.

06:22.570 --> 06:25.495
You have to go to your roots.

06:25.695 --> 06:29.411
This is the knowledge of our roots.

06:29.611 --> 06:35.037
Now to say that it comes from India

06:35.237 --> 06:39.286
or it comes from a particular region is not true.

06:39.486 --> 06:43.662
India being an ancient country, of course,

06:43.862 --> 06:46.620
they have been able to go deep into it,

06:46.820 --> 06:51.037
but even in the Bible you get sentences like,

06:51.237 --> 06:55.453
“I will appear before you like tongues of flames”

06:55.653 --> 07:00.703
and these centers really looks like tongues of flames.

07:00.903 --> 07:05.120
Then in the Koran also it is there called as Assas,

07:05.320 --> 07:07.954
the kundalini, and it is described

07:08.154 --> 07:10.037
that you have to be connected with God,

07:10.237 --> 07:12.912
otherwise whatever you do in the name of God

07:13.112 --> 07:19.245
you’ll become cruel and you will be disintegrated.

07:19.445 --> 07:25.745
It’s clearly said. Same thing in any religion that you read,

07:25.945 --> 07:28.829
that you have to have your self-realization.

07:29.029 --> 07:31.870
Every religion has talked of the spirit.

07:32.070 --> 07:36.745
Every religion has said that you must find out your spirit.

07:36.945 --> 07:40.912
Now, when we are ignorant about the spirit –

07:41.112 --> 07:45.578
and there are so many people in the market which I say

07:45.778 --> 07:49.870
as a ‘guru shopping’ going on – people don’t know

07:50.070 --> 07:54.286
what to expect and what to find.

07:54.486 --> 07:59.703
What is self, what is spirit, and why should we get it?

07:59.903 --> 08:05.620
As I said, it is the epitome of our evolution

08:05.820 --> 08:10.578
that you have to become the spirit and that is the truth

08:10.778 --> 08:14.161
that you are the spirit. If you are the spirit,

08:14.361 --> 08:18.120
then you have to achieve that state,

08:18.320 --> 08:24.453
by this way or that way, that is your birthright –

08:24.653 --> 08:28.411
is born with you, that’s why we call it Sahaja Yoga.

08:28.611 --> 08:33.370
Sahaja means, Saha is ‘with’, ja is ‘born with you’.

08:33.570 --> 08:37.079
That is the yoga, the union with the Divine.

08:37.279 --> 08:42.453
The Divine is the all-pervading power of God’s love,

08:42.653 --> 08:48.829
which is the subtle of subtler all pervading.

08:49.029 --> 08:54.995
It exists in everything and you have to feel it.

08:55.195 --> 09:00.829
That’s what we call as the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost:

09:01.029 --> 09:08.453
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost. In the Bible, there’s no description of Holy Ghost.

09:08.653 --> 09:13.453
This kundalini is the reflection of that Holy Ghost.

09:13.653 --> 09:20.995
Holy Ghost is the desire of God, that’s the power of God

09:21.195 --> 09:24.787
reflected within us as Holy Ghost, as kundalini,

09:24.987 --> 09:29.703
in three-and-a-half coils: is our pure desire.

09:29.903 --> 09:33.411
All other desires that we have are impure

09:33.611 --> 09:37.453
because we have been desiring for this and that,

09:37.653 --> 09:42.453
we know economic laws are such that in general wants

09:42.653 --> 09:47.328
are not satiable. Why? Because those wants are not pure.

09:47.528 --> 09:51.037
So this is the power of kundalini,

09:51.237 --> 09:54.787
which resides in the triangular bone within yourself.

09:54.987 --> 09:57.912
Now, when I am telling all this to you,

09:58.112 --> 10:01.745
you should not have a blind faith about it,

10:01.945 --> 10:06.912
but it’s an hypothesis. If you are a scientific person

10:07.112 --> 10:12.079
or if you have a very logical mind then you must understand

10:12.279 --> 10:15.203
that you should not close your mind.

10:15.403 --> 10:19.495
You should be with an open mind and see for yourself

10:19.695 --> 10:23.370
if this proves, then it’s all right.

10:23.570 --> 10:26.745
But you should not be a person who is cynical,

10:26.945 --> 10:28.870
who is already challenging Me,

10:29.070 --> 10:32.954
because what I am doing is to give you what you have,

10:33.154 --> 10:37.245
is to tell you what you have, which is your property,

10:37.445 --> 10:41.037
it’s your own. I am nothing to do with it as such,

10:41.237 --> 10:46.120
but I can’t also help it without telling you.

10:46.320 --> 10:50.912
This kundalini has to rise from its seat,

10:51.112 --> 10:53.037
which he has shown just now,

10:53.237 --> 10:56.370
which is residing in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

10:56.570 --> 11:02.286
Sacrum itself means ‘sacred’, that means the Greeks knew

11:02.486 --> 11:07.495
about this word, knew about kundalini,

11:07.695 --> 11:09.954
that’s why they called it sacrum.

11:10.154 --> 11:17.203
Now when this kundalini rises through these various centers,

11:17.403 --> 11:20.161
she passes through six centers;

11:20.361 --> 11:24.370
the seventh center is below her,

11:24.570 --> 11:33.286
and this seventh center looks after the glory, or the chastity,

11:33.486 --> 11:38.537
or we can say protects the Mother Kundalini within us.

11:38.737 --> 11:42.203
Now the first center is the most important center,

11:42.403 --> 11:47.745
and the first center is the center of our innocence.

11:47.945 --> 11:52.495
When we try to play with our innocence,

11:52.695 --> 11:57.203
this center gets spoilt which has to protect the kundalini,

11:57.403 --> 12:02.578
and when this center is spoilt we can get into lots of problems.

12:02.778 --> 12:09.120
Nowadays you can hear a big cry about this killer’s disease,

12:09.320 --> 12:13.245
Aids: we have to fight it;

12:13.445 --> 12:15.537
it’s a wrong thing that we have done,

12:15.737 --> 12:18.161
one thing we must accept.

12:18.361 --> 12:20.370
And then we have to fight it;

12:20.570 --> 12:23.245
it’s not difficult to fight this disease if you accept

12:23.445 --> 12:26.161
that you have lost your innocence.

12:26.361 --> 12:33.537
The trouble is when people started getting the knowledge

12:33.737 --> 12:36.870
of the tree, they really went amok.

12:37.070 --> 12:38.662
They didn’t know what to do with themselves –

12:38.862 --> 12:41.079
now they have finished with this, they have finished with that,

12:41.279 --> 12:45.954
so now eat your nose or eat your eyes or eat your teeth,

12:46.154 --> 12:51.286
something like that – a maddening way rushed into people

12:51.486 --> 12:53.995
and they didn’t know what to do with themselves

12:54.195 --> 12:56.662
so they started practicing also sex.

12:56.862 --> 12:59.912
I would also blame Freud for that.

13:00.112 --> 13:04.370
In India Freud won’t be accepted at all; it’s nonsense.

13:04.570 --> 13:09.578
Nobody can accept his theory where they say

13:09.778 --> 13:12.370
that you have all the time feelings

13:12.570 --> 13:15.537
of carnal love for your mother.

13:15.737 --> 13:18.829
Of course, this is ridiculous for us.

13:19.029 --> 13:24.495
But anything new has to be accepted: that’s the modern idea.

13:24.695 --> 13:27.620
Anything new that comes to you, we must accept.

13:27.820 --> 13:31.370
Anything new may not be all right.

13:31.570 --> 13:35.161
The other day we were having a banquet

13:35.361 --> 13:40.120
and I had a neighbor who was Ambassador from Mexico

13:40.320 --> 13:44.370
and he told me that “I know you don’t like Freud

13:44.570 --> 13:48.411
and You like Jung, but Jung talked of the same old thing.”

13:48.611 --> 13:52.954
I said, “Same old thing, but something new about it.”

13:53.154 --> 13:55.912
Evolution takes place in that manner

13:56.112 --> 14:00.328
that first you have the tree and then you have the branches,

14:00.528 --> 14:03.995
then you have the leaves and then you have the flowers

14:04.195 --> 14:06.829
and then the flowers have the fruits.

14:07.029 --> 14:09.286
But if somebody just takes out a flower from somewhere

14:09.486 --> 14:12.912
and gives you, then you know that it’s plastic.

14:13.112 --> 14:18.370
It must have some basis; it must have some tradition.

14:18.570 --> 14:21.745
It must be in our ancient books.

14:21.945 --> 14:26.286
It should be described by people who have lived before.

14:26.486 --> 14:28.245
Suddenly if Mr. Freud comes along

14:28.445 --> 14:31.912
and says some new theory, it’s like mushrooms.

14:32.112 --> 14:34.079
These people come up and start telling stories

14:34.279 --> 14:38.328
and we believe in them. It’s a fungus.

14:38.528 --> 14:41.578
Now, so I told the gentleman, I said,

14:41.778 --> 14:44.161
“All right, we have eaten all kinds of food before.

14:44.361 --> 14:47.203
We haven’t eaten the table: why not we eat that,

14:47.403 --> 14:53.578
because it’s new?” In the same way,

14:53.778 --> 14:57.119
everything that is new we started accepting

14:57.319 --> 15:01.495
because ‘this is new, this is a new idea, we should get to it’

15:01.695 --> 15:05.286
and it’s mad race, I tell you, it’s a real mad race.

15:05.486 --> 15:10.286
All our attention goes to all these mad things.

15:10.486 --> 15:14.245
For example, now, the fashions that have started.

15:14.445 --> 15:17.662
These are entrepreneurs who are materialists,

15:17.862 --> 15:23.161
who want to befool us, all the time changing

15:23.361 --> 15:26.037
one fashion to another to another. Now in England

15:26.237 --> 15:28.870
you won’t find anybody with any hair now left,

15:29.070 --> 15:32.286
because poor things they tried with this, that, and that,

15:32.486 --> 15:35.079
lastly they came to punks and when I said,

15:35.279 --> 15:37.286
“Now to punks, then what?” they said,

15:37.486 --> 15:41.119
“Mother, You’re out of date!” Now it is all bald heads.

15:41.319 --> 15:45.537
This is what is, we are giving up all ourselves,

15:45.737 --> 15:50.495
all our thoughts to somebody who is making us play like this.

15:50.695 --> 15:55.745
Materialism is for us, we are not for materialism.

15:55.945 --> 15:59.537
Matter is for us; we have to dominate this matter.

15:59.737 --> 16:03.703
All the time the spirit is dominating the matter,

16:03.903 --> 16:06.787
and when the spirit comes up,

16:06.987 --> 16:10.286
then it uses matter for its own purpose.

16:10.486 --> 16:12.370
It is not dominated by matter;

16:12.570 --> 16:15.995
nobody can dominate a person who is the spirit.

16:16.195 --> 16:23.620
But we are so much lost into it, trying new things like mad,

16:23.820 --> 16:30.079
jumping from one to another that we don’t see the sense in it,

16:30.279 --> 16:36.870
just like eating the table. We haven’t got our own ideas;

16:37.070 --> 16:42.119
we are reactionaries or we accept ideas that are others’.

16:42.319 --> 16:44.995
If somebody tells us some ideas, we say, “Oh, it’s great.”

16:45.195 --> 16:48.537
But why, why it is great?

16:48.737 --> 16:52.079
It must be tallied by few things.

16:52.279 --> 16:54.119
First of all, we must find out

16:54.319 --> 16:57.787
does it have any relationship to any tradition,

16:57.987 --> 17:03.453
to any ancient books, to any prophets,

17:03.653 --> 17:06.037
to any incarnations who came on this earth?

17:06.237 --> 17:09.912
They were not all useless people, they were not false people,

17:10.112 --> 17:14.286
they were not telling us lies. But we are reactionaries,

17:14.486 --> 17:17.870
like we find now Christianity has failed,

17:18.070 --> 17:21.995
the churches are failing, so we react. No,

17:22.195 --> 17:25.787
Christianity may fail but Christ doesn’t fail.

17:25.987 --> 17:30.370
Like yesterday we had a very interesting couple of people,

17:30.570 --> 17:32.620
one of them came for my interview

17:32.820 --> 17:34.620
and another one was a photographer.

17:34.820 --> 17:38.954
The photographer is an ardent Christian, so he said,

17:39.154 --> 17:41.453
“Do You mean to say, Mother, we got everything wrong?”

17:41.653 --> 17:44.411
I said, “No. You love Christ, isn’t it?”

17:44.611 --> 17:47.829
“Yes, I love Christ very much.” I said, “Then, you’ll get it.

17:48.029 --> 17:50.537
If you have loved Christ, then you will get it.

17:50.737 --> 17:55.203
But if you are busy with the organizing of Christ,

17:55.403 --> 18:00.120
then it’s rather difficult. You can’t organize Christ.

18:00.320 --> 18:04.120
You cannot dictate Him and you cannot use Him

18:04.320 --> 18:06.537
for your purposes for making money,

18:06.737 --> 18:09.703
for making huge big palaces for yourself.

18:09.903 --> 18:15.578
As you can see what’s happening now in the Vatican –

18:15.778 --> 18:20.870
big problems there are with the Mafia,

18:21.070 --> 18:23.328
and they don’t want to hear it. No, nothing,

18:23.528 --> 18:25.203
they don’t want to hear about it.

18:25.403 --> 18:29.161
How could these people talking of righteousness, of virtue,

18:29.361 --> 18:32.079
of values, have gone to that limit?”

18:32.279 --> 18:38.787
Same in India, Hindu religion has gone to dogs,

18:38.987 --> 18:43.495
absolutely to dogs. They’re using the same black magic,

18:43.695 --> 18:50.037
the same old things which were done in Indian villages.

18:50.237 --> 18:52.537
They have come to the cities now.

18:52.737 --> 18:58.453
In the temples now they are selling drugs

18:58.653 --> 19:03.037
which are of horrible nature to people who come there.

19:03.237 --> 19:08.161
Is that Hinduism? What about Islam?

19:08.361 --> 19:10.787
You see Islamic people, how they are quarrelling

19:10.987 --> 19:13.870
among themselves when Islam is surrender.

19:14.070 --> 19:17.203
They are all fighting among themselves.

19:17.403 --> 19:21.578
Is that the religion which Mohammed-Sahib preached?

19:21.778 --> 19:26.453
What about Buddhists? They are another nonsensical people:

19:26.653 --> 19:33.453
extremely materialistic. Every religion has gone to dogs.

19:33.653 --> 19:37.995
Why? Because they did not understand the main point,

19:38.195 --> 19:41.453
and the main point is you should be connected with God.

19:41.653 --> 19:43.161
You are to be born again.

19:43.361 --> 19:46.620
It’s not just to give a certificate to yourself, “I’m a born-again”

19:46.820 --> 19:49.453
going about: “I’m a born-again.”

19:49.653 --> 19:52.954
One lady from that came actually to beat Me!

19:53.154 --> 19:54.745
I started laughing at her!

19:54.945 --> 19:58.245
This born-again lady has come to beat Me, for what?

19:58.445 --> 20:06.620
You cannot certify yourself. This self-certificate

20:06.820 --> 20:10.120
or certificate from somebody is absurd.

20:10.320 --> 20:14.119
You have to have the powers of being born-again.

20:14.319 --> 20:19.620
The born-again have powers of their own manifesting,

20:19.820 --> 20:22.245
they are not just born-again going around.

20:22.445 --> 20:26.328
Now what are the powers of a person who is born again?

20:26.528 --> 20:33.495
First of all, such a person is a tranquil, peaceful person;

20:33.695 --> 20:37.203
he becomes automatically righteous, automatically.

20:37.403 --> 20:40.079
I don’t have to tell you, “Don’t do this and don’t do that.”

20:40.279 --> 20:44.119
That’s finished now with Moses. No more of that.

20:44.319 --> 20:46.787
As soon as you become the Spirit,

20:46.987 --> 20:51.578
you just give up all those things that are destructive for us,

20:51.778 --> 20:57.370
automatically. No pressures are needed,

20:57.570 --> 21:01.662
no warning is needed, nothing of the kind, automatically,

21:01.862 --> 21:05.203
because the spirit is the light, you get your enlightenment.

21:05.403 --> 21:08.745
Supposing I am holding a snake in my hand,

21:08.945 --> 21:11.370
and it’s not light. Somebody tells me it’s a snake,

21:11.570 --> 21:14.453
I say, “No, it’s a rope, I am holding on to a rope.”

21:14.653 --> 21:19.286
But when there is a light I just drop it. In a simple way,

21:19.486 --> 21:22.286
nobody has to tell Me, I see the light and it drops out.

21:22.486 --> 21:25.662
In the same way, you are an enlightened person.

21:25.862 --> 21:30.328
You can make out what is truth and what is untruth.

21:30.528 --> 21:35.703
For example, you see someone, even from Indian jails,

21:35.903 --> 21:37.870
some people who have just come out of jails,

21:38.070 --> 21:39.703
they don’t know what to do with themselves.

21:39.903 --> 21:43.161
So they walk out with saffron clothes to Germany,

21:43.361 --> 21:47.745
maybe to Australia also, and they become great babajis here.

21:47.945 --> 21:53.537
Now these great babajis sit on some of the important places

21:53.737 --> 21:57.245
in the city and everybody is surrounding them,

21:57.445 --> 22:01.119
giving them money, giving them their lives, you see,

22:01.319 --> 22:04.537
all big talk of love going on and everything.

22:04.737 --> 22:10.245
Is he a realized soul or not? How will you find out?

22:10.445 --> 22:14.995
You don’t know whether he’s a realized soul or not

22:15.195 --> 22:20.203
because you are not at an absolute point.

22:20.403 --> 22:24.370
You are still in a relative understanding.

22:24.570 --> 22:28.328
Because this person is wearing this kind of a dress,

22:28.528 --> 22:32.620
is sitting very quietly there, so he must be a babajii.

22:32.820 --> 22:37.453
You cannot recognize a person,

22:37.653 --> 22:42.203
whether a person is true or not. You can’t recognize Me,

22:42.403 --> 22:45.119
either, whether I am telling you the truth or not.

22:45.319 --> 22:48.787
Unless and until you become that absolute being,

22:48.987 --> 22:51.703
you cannot make it out. Then what happens,

22:51.903 --> 22:54.620
that when the kundalini rises and pierces

22:54.820 --> 22:56.829
through your fontanel bone area,

22:57.029 --> 23:00.578
then you also start feeling on your fingertips –

23:00.778 --> 23:02.370
these fingertips are nothing

23:02.570 --> 23:06.037
but the sympathetic nervous system centers,

23:06.237 --> 23:16.745
which are indicating of the truth. If the person has got cool

23:16.945 --> 23:20.870
wind or cool breeze coming from that person,

23:21.070 --> 23:26.037
then he is a real one. If he doesn’t have, then he is not.

23:26.237 --> 23:34.037
There are many persons who claim to be great,

23:34.237 --> 23:36.829
but they are not – ultimately we find out

23:37.029 --> 23:39.495
and we are shocked the way they are.

23:39.695 --> 23:43.620
We don’t know, how is it our brain has failed,

23:43.820 --> 23:47.453
how is it our brilliance did not show clearly

23:47.653 --> 23:51.703
what was wrong with this gentleman?

23:51.903 --> 23:55.870
Because we are not that. We have to accept humbly

23:56.070 --> 23:58.161
that we are still at a human awareness

23:58.361 --> 24:00.912
and we have to be at a spiritual awareness.

24:01.112 --> 24:02.995
That’s the dimension we have to get,

24:03.195 --> 24:05.912
otherwise we cannot judge things properly.

24:06.112 --> 24:09.954
In this country now we have certain problems,

24:10.154 --> 24:12.370
in this whole world we have problems –

24:12.570 --> 24:17.079
problems of atom bomb, every day you are hearing

24:17.279 --> 24:18.995
about this problem and that problem:

24:19.195 --> 24:26.037
all created by human beings. Imagine, intelligent,

24:26.237 --> 24:32.537
such good people have created problems for themselves:

24:32.737 --> 24:37.161
killing each other, preparing bombs and things like that;

24:37.361 --> 24:40.912
protecting each other – I mean, no animal does that.

24:41.112 --> 24:45.703
Only human beings are trying to protect themselves

24:45.903 --> 24:50.453
from each other. They’re all the time worried

24:50.653 --> 24:54.578
who is going to attack them; not sure of themselves.

24:54.778 --> 24:59.453
The reason is they haven’t reached that state of absoluteness.

24:59.653 --> 25:04.161
The time has come now, the time has come for you

25:04.361 --> 25:08.703
either to take to constructive working out of the problem,

25:08.903 --> 25:13.703
or the destructive. By discussions, by arguments,

25:13.903 --> 25:16.787
by anything you are not going to achieve anything

25:16.987 --> 25:20.037
unless and until there’s a complete transformation

25:20.237 --> 25:24.829
in the human mind. And transformation is only possible

25:25.029 --> 25:26.912
when you become the Spirit,

25:27.112 --> 25:30.119
because Spirit is the universal being within you.

25:30.319 --> 25:33.537
And you become collectively conscious – means,

25:33.737 --> 25:35.079
you start a universal feeling;

25:35.279 --> 25:37.995
you just start feeling another person on your fingertips.

25:38.195 --> 25:43.745
And if you know how to correct it, you have corrected that person.

25:43.945 --> 25:49.079
This is only the play of love of God;

25:49.279 --> 25:52.161
it’s so simple, even children can do it.

25:52.361 --> 25:57.203
Many children when they put their fingers in their mouth or their thumbs in their mouth,

25:57.403 --> 26:01.328
according to Mr. Freud it’s something nonsense,

26:01.528 --> 26:03.954
but according to us they are suggesting

26:04.154 --> 26:07.537
what centers you are catching.

26:07.737 --> 26:13.286
To understand your own children you have to be a realized soul

26:13.486 --> 26:17.328
because the understanding is still not matured.

26:17.528 --> 26:20.079
Unless and until you become a realized soul,

26:20.279 --> 26:23.620
you are not a mature personality to judge anything.

26:23.820 --> 26:28.203
At that level, whatever you judge will have another point of view.

26:28.403 --> 26:34.662
You can take ten small children who are realized souls –

26:34.862 --> 26:38.411
we have many like that – and hide their eyes.

26:38.611 --> 26:42.328
Now ask them, “What’s the wrong with this particular person?”

26:42.528 --> 26:45.954
They will all raise one finger meaning this, or this finger.

26:46.154 --> 26:50.120
If this finger, means that person feels guilty for nothing at all

26:50.320 --> 26:53.495
(it’s the Vishuddhi on the left-hand side) or the right,

26:53.695 --> 26:56.829
means he talks too much and he has problems here.

26:57.029 --> 27:05.037
This knowledge becomes your own.

27:05.237 --> 27:08.787
This is one of the powers I have described to you

27:08.987 --> 27:13.954
that you feel the collective consciousness within yourself.

27:14.154 --> 27:19.703
Whatever you achieve in your evolution is a living process.

27:19.903 --> 27:26.120
It is not a dead process, it’s a living process

27:26.320 --> 27:30.245
by which your central nervous system can feel

27:30.445 --> 27:38.120
what is around you, what is within you.

27:38.320 --> 27:40.745
What you call the parasympathetic nervous system

27:40.945 --> 27:43.286
gets activated, and you can understand

27:43.486 --> 27:45.954
the parasympathetic while, if there are any doctors

27:46.154 --> 27:48.245
they will tell you that they don’t know much

27:48.445 --> 27:53.745
about parasympathetic. Now all these things happen to you

27:53.945 --> 27:58.453
and even if you are a child, you can manage the show.

27:58.653 --> 28:01.119
The second power that you get

28:01.319 --> 28:04.703
is that you can raise the kundalini of another person

28:04.903 --> 28:08.537
like one enlightened light can enlighten another person.

28:08.737 --> 28:12.079
But we cannot deal with people who are nasty,

28:12.279 --> 28:17.954
who are superficial, who are stupid, not meant for that.

28:18.154 --> 28:25.995
It is meant for people who are seekers, who are intense:

28:26.195 --> 28:32.537
they are the chosen ones and they are called as ‘seekers’

28:32.737 --> 28:41.662
nowadays. They might be drug addicts, or they might be anything – doesn’t matter.

28:41.862 --> 28:44.453
They have been truly seeking;

28:44.653 --> 28:48.870
they have taken something wrong as right

28:49.070 --> 28:53.161
or they might have done some mistakes – doesn’t matter.

28:53.361 --> 28:57.411
Everything is forgiven. They will get what they want

28:57.611 --> 29:00.037
because they have been intensely seeking,

29:00.237 --> 29:04.119
truly wanting to be the Spirit.

29:04.319 --> 29:08.119
This is the pure desire of the person that works out –

29:08.319 --> 29:15.161
not a person who is just wanting it for the sake of some sort

29:15.361 --> 29:21.328
of a selfish or some sort of a power-oriented ideas.

29:21.528 --> 29:27.119
Now the third power one gets is this,

29:27.319 --> 29:31.161
that a person becomes absolutely dynamic.

29:31.361 --> 29:38.620
He works very hard in the office time; he can do things

29:38.820 --> 29:42.829
which he has never done before. I know of somebody

29:43.029 --> 29:47.537
who has never done anything artistic,

29:47.737 --> 29:51.370
suddenly he started painting. I know another one

29:51.570 --> 29:54.370
who has never known what is poetry

29:54.570 --> 29:56.578
because he’s a chartered accountant;

29:56.778 --> 29:58.703
he has been dealing with money all the time.

29:58.903 --> 30:02.203
Suddenly he started writing poetry,

30:02.403 --> 30:07.870
that too in Urdu language which is such a difficult thing.

30:08.070 --> 30:13.286
Such dynamism one develops. Apart from that

30:13.486 --> 30:22.120
you develop a special feeling of oneness with others

30:22.320 --> 30:29.370
who are realized souls. Friendship and fraternity

30:29.570 --> 30:34.620
are such a rare quality that you have never seen such people,

30:34.820 --> 30:39.370
even those people who go to fight in the war and all that,

30:39.570 --> 30:43.286
they don’t have that love and that pure understanding

30:43.486 --> 30:48.870
and pure relationship that you find among the people

30:49.070 --> 30:53.578
who are realized souls. There was a girl who had realization

30:53.778 --> 30:56.954
and she went to Sicily; another one was a diplomat,

30:57.154 --> 31:00.370
she had her realization from Rome, she went to Sicily.

31:00.570 --> 31:04.037
And they were sitting in two corners of one restaurant

31:04.237 --> 31:08.245
and they looked at each other and they felt the vibrations

31:08.445 --> 31:12.037
and one got up from there and she asked her,

31:12.237 --> 31:15.079
“Do you feel cool breeze in your hands?” She said,

31:15.279 --> 31:17.912
“Have you got realization from Shri Mataji?” She said,

31:18.112 --> 31:19.328
“Yes, I’ve got it!” and they just hugged each other.

31:19.528 --> 31:21.203
And they were so very happy, they said,

31:21.403 --> 31:23.745
“Mother, such happiness and joy we have never felt with anyone.”

31:23.945 --> 31:26.286
Such security, such help. Anywhere in the world you go,

31:26.486 --> 31:28.245
they are with you, your brothers and sisters in purity:

31:28.445 --> 31:30.703
they don’t want anything – without any lust,

31:30.903 --> 31:33.079
without any greed, just feeling of oneness.

31:33.279 --> 31:35.203
You don’t have to pay anything: how can you pay?

31:35.403 --> 31:38.120
It’s ridiculous again that people think that you can pay for everything.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.954
Now, if you have to say sprout a seed,

31:40.154 --> 31:41.870
how much will you pay to the Mother Earth?

31:42.070 --> 31:43.578
How much money will She take for that kind of a thing?

31:43.778 --> 31:45.286
This is one thing people don’t understand –

31:45.486 --> 31:46.829
anybody who asks for money,

31:47.029 --> 31:48.662
anybody who lives on the money earned in the name of God

31:48.862 --> 31:49.995
cannot be connected with God.

31:50.195 --> 31:56.578
You cannot earn your living in the name of God, you cannot.

31:56.778 --> 32:02.578
Is a simple thing, it’s sinful. Of course, now, they have said,

32:02.778 --> 32:04.245
they have told me that when I travel,

32:04.445 --> 32:08.370
people have to spend money. I mean, I can spend myself,

32:08.570 --> 32:11.245
I, by God’s grace I am alright,

32:11.445 --> 32:13.495
but supposing I was in the condition of Christ,

32:13.695 --> 32:17.203
then people would have paid for this air travel – it’s alright,

32:17.403 --> 32:21.411
doesn’t matter, He need not pay for your salvation.

32:21.611 --> 32:24.745
Air travel you can pay, it’s all right,

32:24.945 --> 32:29.286
but He doesn’t need anything, does He? In the same way,

32:29.486 --> 32:33.829
I don’t need anything. What I need is to see

32:34.029 --> 32:36.037
that many people get their realization,

32:36.237 --> 32:38.120
then they become their spirit.

32:38.320 --> 32:46.203
By God’s grace it is working out very well in Australia.

32:46.403 --> 32:51.829
Australia surprisingly has worked out so well

32:52.029 --> 32:55.829
and I am sure that these things will work out

32:56.029 --> 32:58.578
today also here in Brisbane.

32:58.778 --> 33:01.411
The another good thing about Sahaja Yoga

33:01.611 --> 33:05.286
is that you settle down with good marriages.

33:05.486 --> 33:10.453
We have had 71 marriages last year and out of them

33:10.653 --> 33:15.328
100% they are successful and they have beautiful children,

33:15.528 --> 33:20.495
very beautiful children, and very sweet lives

33:20.695 --> 33:24.578
they are leading together. It is surprising how,

33:24.778 --> 33:29.578
from the muck of that nonsense that was there,

33:29.778 --> 33:34.829
the ideas of destroying the whole humanity,

33:35.029 --> 33:39.411
how these beautiful lotuses have come out.

33:39.611 --> 33:45.870
When I see that I forget that there are so many more

33:46.070 --> 33:51.995
have to come out of it. It has to work out.

33:52.195 --> 33:55.870
There are so many who can receive it

33:56.070 --> 33:58.037
and become the lotus flowers

33:58.237 --> 34:00.954
to make the whole universe fragrant.

34:01.154 --> 34:08.787
It’s a work of few years more I think,

34:08.987 --> 34:15.037
I am sure lots of people will get realization,

34:15.237 --> 34:19.620
but those who do not want, those who are adamant,

34:19.820 --> 34:25.662
those who do not want to have the blessings of God,

34:25.862 --> 34:33.662
will be judged because this is the Day of Judgment.

34:33.862 --> 34:40.370
I hope today most of you will get your realization.

34:40.570 --> 34:43.703
I would like some of you to ask Me questions,

34:43.903 --> 34:45.662
but ask relevant questions

34:45.862 --> 34:48.370
and not just questions to attack Me

34:48.570 --> 34:51.870
because I am not come here for an election or anything.

34:52.070 --> 34:54.945
Just simple questions.

35:03.029 --> 35:04.620
Can you get Me some water?

35:04.820 --> 35:07.862
So many speeches, morning to evening!

35:28.903 --> 35:30.737
Yes, please?

35:47.862 --> 35:51.453
Is it possible that those who teach about the spirit

35:51.653 --> 35:54.578
differ on different points?

35:54.778 --> 35:58.328
In the beginning they do, little bit,

35:58.528 --> 36:01.245
still they are not settled down, you see.

36:01.445 --> 36:03.537
They have to mature in Sahaja Yoga, no doubt,

36:03.737 --> 36:08.203
but in the beginning they do little bit differ but not much.

36:08.403 --> 36:10.495
In the beginning they do little bit sometimes differ,

36:10.695 --> 36:13.662
that I have seen, because one has to mature first of all.

36:13.862 --> 36:16.079
Once they are mature, they don’t.

36:16.279 --> 36:18.954
They are very much in unison with each other.

36:19.154 --> 36:23.154
There’s no difference at all.

36:42.862 --> 36:45.119
Do you have to sit in any special posture

36:45.319 --> 36:48.370
when you are doing this or can it be done at any time,

36:48.570 --> 36:50.453
in any way

36:50.653 --> 36:53.787
No. You see in this Sahaja Yoga you become the Spirit,

36:53.987 --> 36:55.829
then you don’t have to meditate much –

36:56.029 --> 36:58.286
about ten minutes or so is sufficient –

36:58.486 --> 37:04.286
and there’s nothing much particular restriction or anything in it,

37:04.486 --> 37:06.537
you can sit in any pose you like,

37:06.737 --> 37:09.328
there is no restriction of any kind

37:09.528 --> 37:10.995
because you become the Spirit.

37:11.195 --> 37:14.578
Only thing is you have to get into thoughtless awareness,

37:14.778 --> 37:17.870
that’s the first state is, which we call as Nirvichara

37:18.070 --> 37:21.703
and for that state to achieve, you see, you have to sit down just

37:21.903 --> 37:24.537
and refuse to take any thoughts in your mind.

37:24.737 --> 37:26.912
Just say, “Not this, not this” so suddenly

37:27.112 --> 37:29.578
because your kundalini is there already up there,

37:29.778 --> 37:32.578
so you become thoughtlessly aware.

37:32.778 --> 37:34.870
Once you become thoughtlessly aware,

37:35.070 --> 37:38.370
you can stay like that for about five minutes or so –

37:38.570 --> 37:41.662
just that’s all. It’s not much time is needed

37:41.862 --> 37:46.528
because you are in meditation.

38:01.403 --> 38:04.870
He says that from his previous experience he finds

38:05.070 --> 38:10.161
that it is not possible to have a moment or so

38:10.361 --> 38:12.328
where there is no thought.

38:12.528 --> 38:16.954
It’s true, you cannot till the kundalini is awakened, you can’t have.

38:17.154 --> 38:21.537
You see, one thought arises and falls,

38:21.737 --> 38:23.662
another thought rises and falls;

38:23.862 --> 38:26.245
there’s a little space in between

38:26.445 --> 38:29.703
which we call in Sanskrit as Vilambha, very little spaces.

38:29.903 --> 38:32.119
Now what happened with kundalini awakening,

38:32.319 --> 38:35.037
both these thoughts become elongated

38:35.237 --> 38:37.161
and this Vilambha increases.

38:37.361 --> 38:40.079
So you will automatically have that,

38:40.279 --> 38:43.403
you won’t have to worry about that.

38:57.611 --> 39:00.161
Is the kundalini awakening good for the children?

39:00.361 --> 39:04.537
Excellent. They are the best. Children are the best –

39:04.737 --> 39:07.411
I mean, they have no complications, you see.

39:07.611 --> 39:08.912
We are complicated,

39:09.112 --> 39:10.870
we are on the left side or the right side,

39:11.070 --> 39:14.411
we have complications. They are such balanced things,

39:14.611 --> 39:21.079
they are the best. Children are the best – the more the merrier!

39:21.279 --> 39:24.119
I told them to bring all the children here

39:24.319 --> 39:26.453
and I would have been so happy in their company.

39:26.653 --> 39:33.237
They may be – most of them – may be already born realized, you can’t say.

39:49.445 --> 39:54.495
What is the sensitivity of the children?

39:54.695 --> 40:01.954
If they are sensitive, how would the children be guarded

40:02.154 --> 40:05.203
against being hurt by others?

40:05.403 --> 40:08.328
Oh, they know themselves, they are very clever,

40:08.528 --> 40:10.703
and they are to be told how to take

40:10.903 --> 40:14.745
a guarding thing around their body and all that,

40:14.945 --> 40:16.745
and they do it. They are very sweet,

40:16.945 --> 40:19.370
even little, little things they do with their hands,

40:19.570 --> 40:21.954
raising of their kundalini, very sweetly,

40:22.154 --> 40:24.787
and they could immediately as soon as they see a horrid man

40:24.987 --> 40:28.119
they just start doing like that, they are very active.

40:28.319 --> 40:30.903
Must say, they are very good.

40:39.903 --> 40:41.245
Would that be teaching them to put a golden light?

40:41.445 --> 40:43.662
Yes, what we call as bandhan,

40:43.862 --> 40:47.453
is means that it’s a kind of a protective thing to your auras.

40:47.653 --> 40:49.411
You see, you put with your own hands

40:49.611 --> 40:51.703
because the vibrations start flowing from your hand,

40:51.903 --> 40:54.328
then you just give it a bandhan,

40:54.528 --> 40:57.286
and the children do it immediately, they do it immediately.

40:57.486 --> 41:01.161
They’re very quick. They are tremendous.

41:01.361 --> 41:04.119
They are the ones who protect.

41:04.319 --> 41:07.745
One father wanted to have his realization, couldn’t reach,

41:07.945 --> 41:10.703
so he just got so frustrated came on to My Feet,

41:10.903 --> 41:13.411
so this fellow came on My Feet

41:13.611 --> 41:16.662
but his child jumped on his back and he started using

41:16.862 --> 41:19.370
a bit of slide to take his kundalini up first.

41:19.570 --> 41:22.279
It was so interesting the way children react.

41:38.737 --> 41:42.995
How did You begin this? How were You initiated in this?

41:43.195 --> 41:47.745
I was not initiated; I had this from My very childhood.

41:47.945 --> 41:53.745
You see, I know you would like to know about Me;

41:53.945 --> 41:56.537
it’s better first you know yourself,

41:56.737 --> 41:59.486
then you’ll know about Me better. All right?

42:54.611 --> 43:01.662
She’s asked if you would leave the present plane of consciousness

43:01.862 --> 43:04.245
just by getting to the realization.

43:04.445 --> 43:06.453
She said that she has come here to learn

43:06.653 --> 43:10.703
but it shouldn’t happen that you lose your present plane

43:10.903 --> 43:16.161
of consciousness. Is that the question?

43:16.361 --> 43:20.620
No, you don’t lose it. No, no, nothing like that.

43:20.820 --> 43:23.495
No, no, nothing like that happens.

43:23.695 --> 43:27.870
Actually what happens that you get a additional,

43:28.070 --> 43:31.954
new awareness within yourself. You are very much there,

43:32.154 --> 43:35.079
very much alert, absolutely aware,

43:35.279 --> 43:40.119
but you get an additional awareness which is of the Spirit.

43:40.319 --> 43:43.037
You don’t lose anything like that.

43:43.237 --> 43:46.079
Say, now, for example, you have a brother.

43:46.279 --> 43:50.995
Now you have not very good feelings for him, say,

43:51.195 --> 43:55.620
for example. When you get your realization,

43:55.820 --> 44:01.870
you see that he’s a good boy and you forgive him

44:02.070 --> 44:06.995
with your heart and you love him and you forget

44:07.195 --> 44:10.286
that what was wrong with him.

44:10.486 --> 44:14.370
You see the good points about him, because you become absolute.

44:14.570 --> 44:21.161
Your judgment differs. You laugh at yourself.

44:21.361 --> 44:27.870
What was wrong with him is no more.

44:28.070 --> 44:31.411
I was wrong at that time. You don’t mind accepting that point:

44:31.611 --> 44:34.787
I was wrong, not now, I was.

44:34.987 --> 44:45.495
Another thing is, supposing you have a particular habit

44:45.695 --> 44:50.495
and you can’t get over it, it’s impossible. Even if you want to,

44:50.695 --> 44:54.328
you cannot. Now you are so powerful that you don’t look at it.

44:54.528 --> 44:59.037
You don’t want to have it any more. You just don’t like it.

44:59.237 --> 45:05.079
I would say this way, that an animal can pass

45:05.279 --> 45:09.161
through a dirty lane, it doesn’t feel the dirt or filth or anything,

45:09.361 --> 45:12.037
doesn’t smell anything, but a human being cannot.

45:12.237 --> 45:15.912
In the same way the realized soul doesn’t like anything

45:16.112 --> 45:20.370
that is wrong. It becomes righteous automatically,

45:20.570 --> 45:25.578
virtuous automatically, and he’s not asserting that on anyone.

45:25.778 --> 45:30.286
They are virtuous, they are righteous and they live in their own glory.

45:30.486 --> 45:44.079
This is how the awareness takes a beautiful turn.

45:44.279 --> 45:50.695
Anything else, please?

45:56.237 --> 45:57.578
Do You believe in reincarnation?

45:57.778 --> 46:00.912
Yes, of course, there is reincarnation, no doubt about it

46:01.112 --> 46:03.370
and when Christ has said, “I’ll come again”,

46:03.570 --> 46:06.161
that means there is reincarnation.

46:06.361 --> 46:12.620
So, but most important thing, what are you, now?

46:12.820 --> 46:16.662
And what you get, now, is the most important.

46:16.862 --> 46:19.286
We shouldn’t worry about what we were in last life –

46:19.486 --> 46:21.119
what does it matter?

46:21.319 --> 46:27.029
Yes, please?

46:35.445 --> 46:38.079
Is your spirit one with your mental and physical being

46:38.279 --> 46:40.286
or is it separate from it?

46:40.486 --> 46:44.537
It enlightens all that. Now can you say that this light

46:44.737 --> 46:50.203
that is enlightening us, is it one with us or without us?

46:50.403 --> 46:54.995
You see the light is separate, the spirit is separate from us,

46:55.195 --> 47:00.203
no doubt, but it integrates everything. The reason is we see.

47:00.403 --> 47:03.870
Now for example you’re sitting in an enlightened way,

47:04.070 --> 47:05.912
but supposing you are sitting in the darkness,

47:06.112 --> 47:07.870
you’ll be rushing each other, you would not know

47:08.070 --> 47:10.870
how you stand with each other, there’s no integration.

47:11.070 --> 47:19.537
So the light on the physical, mental, emotional side

47:19.737 --> 47:24.703
of our life is complete and completely integrated.

47:24.903 --> 47:30.319
That’s a good question.

47:45.945 --> 47:47.611
When a person is enlightened,

47:49.528 --> 47:52.995
Of course, of course. When you are enlightened,

47:53.195 --> 47:56.237
you can enlighten another person: that’s the power you get.

48:03.653 --> 48:05.119
How does it happen?

48:05.319 --> 48:08.037
It happens because you become that.

48:08.237 --> 48:09.662
Supposing there’s one candle.

48:09.862 --> 48:11.995
Now this candle is not enlightened, all right?

48:12.195 --> 48:14.203
Now I enlighten this, then with this candle

48:14.403 --> 48:20.578
I can enlighten any other candle. So simple as that.

48:20.778 --> 48:29.203
It is so simple. You see, everything that is divine is simple;

48:29.403 --> 48:32.829
everything that is human is complicated.

48:33.029 --> 48:37.279
Take it like that. It’s extremely simple.

48:45.570 --> 48:49.495
In your discourse You referred to the kundalini

48:49.695 --> 48:53.037
as ‘She’. Is that because You are a woman?

48:53.237 --> 48:58.703
No, no no; She is the female side, you see.

48:58.903 --> 49:01.245
She is the Shakti, She is the female side.

49:01.445 --> 49:06.537
That’s why the quarrel about women and men

49:06.737 --> 49:12.995
is all falsehood. There’s nothing like that; they exist together.

49:13.195 --> 49:15.995
It’s like the moon and the moonlight;

49:16.195 --> 49:19.328
it’s like the sun and the sunlight;

49:19.528 --> 49:22.119
it’s like the God and the Kundalini;

49:22.319 --> 49:28.361
it’s like the word and the meaning.

49:41.486 --> 49:44.578
Is it fair to say that the kundalini energy arises

49:44.778 --> 49:48.453
and meets another energy coming from above?

49:48.653 --> 49:53.620
Yes, it is all-pervading power, all right now?

49:53.820 --> 49:58.119
When the kundalini rises, what she does,

49:58.319 --> 50:03.286
she enlightens our subtler side of our nerves, our brain

50:03.486 --> 50:07.829
and everything, she enlightens and by that we start feeling it.

50:08.029 --> 50:10.370
Is the enlightenment that we get

50:10.570 --> 50:13.829
because of our connection with the all-pervading power?

50:14.029 --> 50:18.286
It exists, already it exists, but you cannot feel it normally.

50:18.486 --> 50:23.787
When she rises then your nerves are so enlightened

50:23.987 --> 50:32.328
that you can feel it. All right? You might be already getting it;

50:32.528 --> 50:36.370
I think so. All right, should we have it now?

50:36.570 --> 50:41.778
All right, again, one more question.

50:51.361 --> 50:55.829
I’ve heard that there are stories that it is dangerous

50:56.029 --> 50:59.453
to arouse the kundalini. Why are there such stories?

50:59.653 --> 51:03.912
The stories are because people who were not authorized

51:04.112 --> 51:07.328
have tried to raise the kundalini.

51:07.528 --> 51:12.119
The person who has to raise the kundalini has to be authorized

51:12.319 --> 51:17.537
by the Divine. Such a person must have that pure character.

51:17.737 --> 51:23.495
These people just try to raise the kundalini

51:23.695 --> 51:27.119
and the deity of the last chakra,

51:27.319 --> 51:29.995
what they call the chakra of innocence,

51:30.195 --> 51:32.662
is the one which gets annoyed,

51:32.862 --> 51:39.954
and that’s how they get into trouble. As I told you,

51:40.154 --> 51:43.995
this is the chakra looks after …

51:44.195 --> 51:47.995
Those people who are not authorized to do it, or we can say,

51:48.195 --> 51:51.286
in a very gross way one can explain this way,

51:51.486 --> 51:54.328
that a person who does not know about electricity

51:54.528 --> 51:57.954
and puts his finger into the plug, he gets a shock.

51:58.154 --> 52:00.286
But it’s much worse than that.

52:00.486 --> 52:04.662
A person who does not have a proper character or a proper life

52:04.862 --> 52:10.328
and tries these tricks gets into trouble.

52:10.528 --> 52:14.120
Not by the kundalini but by the deity

52:14.320 --> 52:19.578
which is protecting its chastity.

52:19.778 --> 52:29.411
These stories are there, and naturally such people should,

52:29.611 --> 52:33.620
they give these sensational stories and people like it,

52:33.820 --> 52:35.537
and many people follow them.

52:35.737 --> 52:37.703
I mean, it is so dangerous

52:37.903 --> 52:40.829
to be following all those wrong things.

52:41.029 --> 52:46.537
Now, I must have given this kundalini awakening to thousands

52:46.737 --> 52:48.578
and thousands and thousands of people

52:48.778 --> 52:53.119
and nobody had any problem. She’s your mother,

52:53.319 --> 52:57.079
and as your mother has given you your birth,

52:57.279 --> 52:59.120
taking all your pains herself,

52:59.320 --> 53:00.703
She takes up all the pains.

53:00.903 --> 53:02.662
She doesn’t give you any trouble at all.

53:02.862 --> 53:05.328
At the most you might feel a little tingling or something.

53:05.528 --> 53:10.995
Maybe if somebody’s possessed

53:11.195 --> 53:13.870
then he starts a little bit jumping also;

53:14.070 --> 53:18.119
if there’s a possessed man, starts a little bit jumping,

53:18.319 --> 53:23.495
but so far we didn’t have any funny experiences of that kind.

53:23.695 --> 53:27.954
TM people start jumping –

53:28.154 --> 53:33.119
I’ve seen that, or people from this black magic –

53:33.319 --> 53:36.328
they start jumping before Me.

53:36.528 --> 53:40.745
Also these Rastafarians, they started jumping.

53:40.945 --> 53:44.954
There’s some people who do that way, but they’re all possessed,

53:45.154 --> 53:53.662
they’re not normal people. But they jump for a while;

53:53.862 --> 53:57.319
you can bring them round; it’s not so difficult.

54:17.653 --> 54:22.037
What happens to the Spirit after you die on this earth?

54:22.237 --> 54:27.453
We’ll talk about it later; it’s a very long subject.

54:27.653 --> 54:30.161
You see, the Spirit, when you die,

54:30.361 --> 54:35.537
has different diverse type of existence after we die.

54:35.737 --> 54:38.829
It depends on – if you are a realized soul you are a free bird,

54:39.029 --> 54:41.620
do what you like. But if you are not

54:41.820 --> 54:43.829
then you are different categories,

54:44.029 --> 54:48.411
and according to your categories you live and exist,

54:48.611 --> 54:52.161
but I think that’s a very long subject, and some other time

54:52.361 --> 54:55.737
I’ll let you know about it, all right? Yes?

55:07.653 --> 55:12.079
I don’t know why, but I’m so reluctant to be enlightened.

55:12.279 --> 55:16.203
Firstly, you have a liver problem, Sir,

55:16.403 --> 55:21.370
and a lot of heat in the body. If you put your left hand on here

55:21.570 --> 55:25.370
the heat will come down – no, no, left hand on the right side,

55:25.570 --> 55:28.495
a lot of heat, and the reluctance is there.

55:28.695 --> 55:33.079
The liver is the horrid stuff, you see, that makes all the problems.

55:33.279 --> 55:37.537
Put your right hand like this, and…

55:37.737 --> 55:46.119
Liver makes you think, think, think, think all the time.

55:46.319 --> 55:50.279
Anything else?

56:09.319 --> 56:12.286
What makes for suffering and misery in this world

56:12.486 --> 56:14.787
and why do people cheat each other?

56:14.987 --> 56:24.029
(he feels the distress also)

56:24.737 --> 56:29.245
This is good, but you should see this as human beings

56:29.445 --> 56:33.537
treating each other like that, isn’t it? What to do?

56:33.737 --> 56:37.537
That’s the question I ask you. You see, all this stupidity,

56:37.737 --> 56:39.620
why is it there? It is there

56:39.820 --> 56:42.203
because they are not the Spirit as yet.

56:42.403 --> 56:48.245
They need transformation; all of them need transformation.

56:48.445 --> 56:50.286
But supposing tomorrow Hitler comes

56:50.486 --> 56:52.411
and asks Me for transformation, I say,

56:52.611 --> 57:04.319
“I’m sorry, next life we’ll see about it”! Yes?

57:17.403 --> 57:25.912
In taking out of the stress from other people, do you get it

57:26.112 --> 57:29.870
on Your body and does it come in as pain to You?

57:30.070 --> 57:34.662
No, nothing. I’m not taking out anything, you see.

57:34.862 --> 57:43.995
Just a state of mind which becomes enlightened by the Spirit.

57:44.195 --> 57:48.703
You just become relaxed, that’s all. It’s in your own will.

57:48.903 --> 57:52.037
Supposing, now, this is ‘on’ and this is ‘off’

57:52.237 --> 57:59.537
in the same way, but it is nothing that I have to do about it.

57:59.737 --> 58:02.995
See, it’s within you, just works out within you,

58:03.195 --> 58:05.328
and the kundalini itself, when she rises,

58:05.528 --> 58:10.611
relaxes you automatically. So why will it hurt Me?

58:14.695 --> 58:16.954
She’s asking will it hurt her if she’s taking on the stresses

58:17.154 --> 58:18.411
of other people?

58:18.611 --> 58:23.954
No, no. In the beginning I would say you should not do that

58:24.154 --> 58:25.537
because in the beginning you don’t know

58:25.737 --> 58:28.453
how to do it properly, but after you are mature

58:28.653 --> 58:32.370
nothing can happen. You see, like something,

58:32.570 --> 58:35.870
which is not matured, can take the imprints,

58:36.070 --> 58:39.829
but once it is matured it is perfectly all right.

58:40.029 --> 58:41.787
First you have to mature yourself.

58:41.987 --> 58:45.070
Takes about a month to mature yourself, then it’s all right.

58:57.361 --> 59:00.954
Why did the stressed person become that?

59:01.154 --> 59:03.245
Is it because of the charkas being blocked?

59:03.445 --> 59:08.203
Yes, very much, very much. Blocked or imbalanced,

59:08.403 --> 59:11.912
specially imbalance. Imbalance is very much,

59:12.112 --> 59:14.745
because the chakras are like this supposing, all right?

59:14.945 --> 59:16.662
Now, you push it too much this side,

59:16.862 --> 59:20.703
there’s an imbalance and this chakra’s become blocked here.

59:20.903 --> 59:23.787
Now this could be on the left side or the right side;

59:23.987 --> 59:27.361
any side it can work out. This is due to imbalances.

01:00:05.528 --> 01:00:11.037
I have search for the material and a search for the spiritual,

01:00:11.237 --> 01:00:14.203
but while I am young should I use it for the search

01:00:14.403 --> 01:00:17.119
for the material or the search for the spiritual?

01:00:17.319 --> 01:00:20.578
If you get the Spirit you get the material automatically.

01:00:20.778 --> 01:00:28.870
The whole material is controlled by the Spirit.

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:33.870
It’s very surprising how you get it.

01:00:34.070 --> 01:00:36.829
You enter into the realm of God.

01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:42.995
You’ll be amazed that in England there’s such a lot

01:00:43.195 --> 01:00:58.161
of joblessness – people don’t have jobs at all – unemployment;

01:00:58.361 --> 01:01:06.079
but not a single Sahaj Yogi is unemployed,

01:01:06.279 --> 01:01:09.453
not a single Sahaj Yogi is unemployed.

01:01:09.653 --> 01:01:12.703
The other day one gentleman was to come

01:01:12.903 --> 01:01:21.119
from Paris to Australia for a particular seminar,

01:01:21.319 --> 01:01:23.245
and he thought it was – he wanted to come

01:01:23.445 --> 01:01:25.537
because this is the other side of the world and all that,

01:01:25.737 --> 01:01:28.286
but quite excited, but he didn’t have money,

01:01:28.486 --> 01:01:32.037
and suddenly he got the money

01:01:32.237 --> 01:01:36.411
which he was to get for eight years.

01:01:36.611 --> 01:01:40.119
Suddenly he got the money and he’s here.

01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:44.829
All such miracles work out.

01:01:45.029 --> 01:01:47.453
From Australia I’ll tell you one miracle, it’s most interesting.

01:01:47.653 --> 01:01:50.245
There was a little girl, she wrote a letter to Me “Mother,

01:01:50.445 --> 01:01:52.495
I want to come and see You in India,

01:01:52.695 --> 01:01:57.119
but I don’t have so much money to come.”

01:01:57.319 --> 01:01:59.453
She and her mother, they both wanted to come.

01:01:59.653 --> 01:02:03.286
They had a fete in the school,

01:02:03.486 --> 01:02:06.620
and she had taken a trinket for selling,

01:02:06.820 --> 01:02:09.411
and when the teacher saw, she said,

01:02:09.611 --> 01:02:14.662
“This is gold, gold, yes, better take it to your mother.”

01:02:14.862 --> 01:02:18.787
And when they went to the jeweler,  the amount was the same

01:02:18.987 --> 01:02:22.328
as they would need to go to India.

01:02:22.528 --> 01:02:25.829
So, in so many ways you are helped.

01:02:26.029 --> 01:02:31.453
You don’t know the realm of God; is very different, so efficient.

01:02:31.653 --> 01:02:37.528
Works so fast. We haven’t entered into that realm.

01:03:09.653 --> 01:03:13.411
These – You’ve talked about the imbalances or blockages

01:03:13.611 --> 01:03:16.119
in the chakras. How do we become aware of them

01:03:16.319 --> 01:03:18.787
and how do we correct them?

01:03:18.987 --> 01:03:21.995
That’s what you have to learn; it’s very simple.

01:03:22.195 --> 01:03:24.495
You see, once you get your realization

01:03:24.695 --> 01:03:28.079
you’ll have to come to our centers and we’ll tell you how to do it.

01:03:28.279 --> 01:03:30.829
It’s very simple. There are a few methods

01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:32.995
by which you can just clear them out.

01:03:33.195 --> 01:03:35.620
But you have to come to our center, you see.

01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:38.245
You have to respect your self realization

01:03:38.445 --> 01:03:41.662
and you have to little bit pay attention to it,

01:03:41.862 --> 01:03:50.411
because people, you see, to them is like buying Coca Cola in a bar shop –

01:03:50.611 --> 01:03:53.703
is not realization.

01:03:53.903 --> 01:03:57.537
It’s the epitome of your evolution, is the highest thing

01:03:57.737 --> 01:04:01.161
and has to be respected that way.

01:04:01.361 --> 01:04:05.119
They come to my lectures all right,

01:04:05.319 --> 01:04:08.870
but they don’t try to work out their realization.

01:04:09.070 --> 01:04:11.662
You have to work it out and you have to become masters.

01:04:11.862 --> 01:04:14.245
You have to become your own gurus.

01:04:14.445 --> 01:04:25.653
All of you can. One more?

01:04:40.903 --> 01:04:43.829
When talking about realization,

01:04:44.029 --> 01:04:47.745
is it that when you get it you keep it or can you lose it,

01:04:47.945 --> 01:04:52.411
or just glimpses of it?

01:04:52.611 --> 01:04:56.620
No, you see, the thing is, if you have realization

01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:01.119
you have to look after it, nourish it, and develop it.

01:05:01.319 --> 01:05:04.578
Just like a little plant, you see.

01:05:04.778 --> 01:05:08.161
When you have a little plant you have to develop it.

01:05:08.361 --> 01:05:12.453
Once it becomes a tree, then many come for the shelter

01:05:12.653 --> 01:05:15.578
under that tree, isn’t it? In the same way

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:18.495
you have to look after it. It may not diminish,

01:05:18.695 --> 01:05:20.912
but it won’t have much effect

01:05:21.112 --> 01:05:24.119
and it will always be in a dangerous position.

01:05:24.319 --> 01:05:30.203
The thing is to make it absolutely matured.

01:05:30.403 --> 01:05:35.995
It hardly takes any time, any effort, any money.

01:05:36.195 --> 01:05:41.279
One has to know how to do it.

01:05:52.029 --> 01:05:55.370
Why have the churches not told us about this?

01:05:55.570 --> 01:05:59.870
That was not the time, Sir. Imagine,

01:06:00.070 --> 01:06:04.662
Christ lived for only three and a half years, in the sense that,

01:06:04.862 --> 01:06:09.954
for His spiritual undertakings, He was allowed only for three

01:06:10.154 --> 01:06:14.829
and a half years to live like that. Churches do not know it,

01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:18.745
but even Christ…. Imagine, for four years

01:06:18.945 --> 01:06:25.620
I was struggling with seven English boys and girls

01:06:25.820 --> 01:06:28.912
to give them realization.

01:06:29.112 --> 01:06:31.662
He did quite a good job, I must say,

01:06:31.862 --> 01:06:34.829
still, but that was not the time.

01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:39.411
Christ actually came on this chakra – is the Agnya Chakra.

01:06:39.611 --> 01:06:43.578
That was His time, to show the way of resurrection;

01:06:43.778 --> 01:06:47.119
that was His life, and that’s what He’s done,

01:06:47.319 --> 01:06:54.245
but the churches have missed the point. Churches have missed the point,

01:06:54.445 --> 01:06:56.286
and they will go on missing the point.

01:06:56.486 --> 01:07:03.787
Their main interest is how to make money. Is not good.

01:07:03.987 --> 01:07:07.737
Or how to convert people – is not good.

01:07:11.319 --> 01:07:14.286
Are there a lot of holy people in the church?

01:07:14.486 --> 01:07:18.203
There could be many people who are very simple,

01:07:18.403 --> 01:07:21.079
who believe in Christ, who go to churches

01:07:21.279 --> 01:07:23.829
because they believe that they’ll be saved.

01:07:24.029 --> 01:07:27.161
All of them will be saved, no doubt.

01:07:27.361 --> 01:07:28.995
They’re very simple people;

01:07:29.195 --> 01:07:34.703
they give such a lot of money to the church and they give such dedication to the church,

01:07:34.903 --> 01:07:37.370
even though they are wrongly placed.

01:07:37.570 --> 01:07:39.912
But they will be saved, no doubt about it.

01:07:40.112 --> 01:07:44.870
They all have to be saved. But there are people

01:07:45.070 --> 01:07:47.120
who are just making money out of churches,

01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:50.995
trying to make an organization out of it.

01:07:51.195 --> 01:07:52.954
They are trying to convert people,

01:07:53.154 --> 01:07:54.995
trying to make a political end out of it;

01:07:55.195 --> 01:08:01.578
then such a thing won’t work out. That’s not proper.

01:08:01.778 --> 01:08:05.495
Churches should only deliver the goods

01:08:05.695 --> 01:08:11.037
of giving realization to people, that’s what a church is for.

01:08:11.237 --> 01:08:18.495
They will learn, I’m sure; they will have to become.

01:08:18.695 --> 01:08:20.620
Some of them will have to become,

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:25.119
but if they are money oriented I just don’t know.

01:08:25.319 --> 01:08:29.787
They are more interested in the kings and prime ministers,

01:08:29.987 --> 01:08:33.662
princesses and all that. I just don’t understand.

01:08:33.862 --> 01:08:37.570
They have nothing to do with God.

01:09:06.319 --> 01:09:08.578
Why is there a need for judgment

01:09:08.778 --> 01:09:12.328
when some people make progress and some don’t progress,

01:09:12.528 --> 01:09:16.370
and why do others judge them?

01:09:16.570 --> 01:09:24.195
Why is there a need for a time of judgment?

01:09:26.154 --> 01:09:30.787
It has to be some time, my child, for judgment,

01:09:30.987 --> 01:09:32.578
and this is a particular time,

01:09:32.778 --> 01:09:35.870
because is what we call the worst time

01:09:36.070 --> 01:09:39.954
because the Man is so much in confusion.

01:09:40.154 --> 01:09:44.203
The most difficult time for human beings

01:09:44.403 --> 01:09:49.453
to exist is modern times, what we call as the Kali Yuga,

01:09:49.653 --> 01:09:53.119
and this was the time when it had to happen,

01:09:53.319 --> 01:09:59.161
otherwise man won’t take to God seriously, perhaps, maybe.

01:09:59.361 --> 01:10:04.703
Maybe our forefathers didn’t have this stress and strain,

01:10:04.903 --> 01:10:07.620
and they didn’t want to relax or think of God.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:10.995
They were quite happy with their agricultural work

01:10:11.195 --> 01:10:14.411
that they were doing, but now it is really we have reached

01:10:14.611 --> 01:10:34.662
to that point. Everything has to come to its boiling point,

01:10:34.862 --> 01:10:42.662
and now this is the time for the world to get its results,

01:10:42.862 --> 01:10:46.778
either this way or that way.

01:11:09.528 --> 01:11:12.370
Why is there a time of judgment now,

01:11:12.570 --> 01:11:16.787
because if there is reincarnation they will keep going back

01:11:16.987 --> 01:11:20.703
and coming until there is a change?

01:11:20.903 --> 01:11:26.453
I’ve already told you that this is the time

01:11:26.653 --> 01:11:30.495
when the people are most confused

01:11:30.695 --> 01:11:34.495
and they have to take a decision.

01:11:34.695 --> 01:11:41.119
That’s why this is the judgment time.

01:11:41.319 --> 01:11:47.662
Either they will go to hell or to heaven, all right?

01:11:47.862 --> 01:11:59.445
Is that – makes you all right? Good.

01:12:06.486 --> 01:12:10.361
Heaven is within us.
