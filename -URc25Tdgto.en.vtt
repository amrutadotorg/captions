WEBVTT

00:01.810 --> 00:10.900
The purpose of these marriages is this, that
we should have international understanding

00:10.900 --> 00:22.490
about human beings that after coming to Sahaja
Yoga we transcend all the barriers, all the

00:22.490 --> 00:31.460
barriers of race, religion, ?? and nationality.

00:31.460 --> 00:45.480
We have to create this homogenous world and
make it peaceful by removing this disease

00:45.480 --> 00:51.700
of national identification or racial identification.

00:51.700 --> 00:56.410
We are all created by God Almighty.

00:56.410 --> 00:58.570
Our differences are only skin deep.

00:58.570 --> 01:06.039
Culturally we are different little bit here
and there but basically in ourselves we are

01:06.039 --> 01:07.039
all spiritual.

01:07.039 --> 01:23.619
And the religion that you have is innate built
in within us which is an part and parcel of

01:23.619 --> 01:24.619
us.

01:24.619 --> 01:32.189
By these marriages we want to achieve a very
happy and a very enjoyable married life.

01:32.189 --> 01:42.560
In the marriage one has to know, nobody should
dominate anyone… that’s a wrong idea.

01:42.560 --> 01:50.000
But we have two wheels of the chariot, one
is big and one is small, then the chariot

01:50.000 --> 01:54.420
will never move forward, it will go round
and round.

01:54.420 --> 02:02.439
Both are equally the same, equal sized, but
they are not similar.

02:02.439 --> 02:06.759
The left cannot be the right and the right
cannot be the left.

02:06.759 --> 02:12.099
So men and women have to be men and women
in Sahaja Yoga.

02:12.099 --> 02:15.420
They cannot be unisex people.

02:15.420 --> 02:16.420
They cannot be.

02:16.420 --> 02:17.620
That’s very important.

02:17.620 --> 02:22.540
The man has to protect the wife, love her,
give her all the security that is needed.

02:22.540 --> 02:29.010
And woman has to nourish the husband and give
him all the love and affection she has.

02:29.010 --> 02:37.239
So here we are on the threshold of entering
into a new life where you have a companion

02:37.239 --> 02:38.820
of your own.

02:38.820 --> 02:42.390
She will be your wife.

02:42.390 --> 02:48.989
Not because only she is in Sahaja Yoga that
you have married her but she’s your own.

02:48.989 --> 02:57.870
So try to prove it to her that you love her
very much and that she is your wife and you

02:57.870 --> 03:00.829
have all that is yours is for her.

03:00.829 --> 03:04.260
This is very important in the very beginning
of it.

03:04.260 --> 03:10.599
Now there’s another thing I have found out
in my experience sometimes that they get married,

03:10.599 --> 03:16.160
I don’t know what happens, they are swayed
into it and they get married.

03:16.160 --> 03:19.549
And after they go back to their own country
they start saying “Mother we know we cannot

03:19.549 --> 03:21.970
manage, we have to work it out.

03:21.970 --> 03:25.390
This, that” Marriages are now worked out.

03:25.390 --> 03:26.850
Spontaneously it happens.

03:26.850 --> 03:31.900
But in India you see we are all the time prepared
for a good married life.

03:31.900 --> 03:33.459
The wife is told, the husband is told all
the time.

03:33.459 --> 03:35.819
So normally when they get married they think
this is what it is for us.

03:35.819 --> 03:37.880
They don’t have love affairs before hand;
they don’t have friends and things.

03:37.880 --> 03:44.500
But even if you had your past, now it’s
finished.

03:44.500 --> 03:52.030
You don’t discuss, don’t tell, don’t
talk about it, do your best.

03:52.030 --> 04:02.569
That’s absolutely wrong because the past
doesn’t exist, what exists is the present.

04:02.569 --> 04:05.709
So enjoy the present, forget it, forgive yourself.

04:05.709 --> 04:12.359
Many people also have this big problem that
they cannot forget their past and go on telling

04:12.359 --> 04:15.049
their wives that I was like this.

04:15.049 --> 04:17.020
There is no need to confess anything.

04:17.020 --> 04:18.419
They think it is honest.

04:18.419 --> 04:29.880
There is no question of honesty or dishonesty
at that time is but to enjoy full joyous mood

04:29.880 --> 04:31.190
of marriage.

04:31.190 --> 04:33.880
That’s in the head.

04:33.880 --> 04:36.380
Otherwise what’s the use of marrying and
then telling stories.

04:36.380 --> 04:42.690
Or some people have very bad habit of telling
him how bad the mother was, the father was

04:42.690 --> 04:47.870
or may be that how miserable he is or how
he has gone through struggle…

04:47.870 --> 04:50.490
there’s no need to talk of this.

04:50.490 --> 04:54.120
At this moment you are married, she is your
wife, and you have to express all your love

04:54.120 --> 05:05.960
and all your attention to her so she feels
secure and happy.

05:05.960 --> 05:07.770
This point please try to note.

05:07.770 --> 05:10.350
Nothing has to be talked about your past.

05:10.350 --> 05:13.000
Then we are Sahaja Yogis.

05:13.000 --> 05:21.479
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis, very great
Sahaja Yogis who are married, very very ordinary

05:21.479 --> 05:24.660
men, very ordinary, ordinary looking superficially.

05:24.660 --> 05:28.449
Or can say some of them could be called as
ugly.

05:28.449 --> 05:34.270
Some girls are like that, some men are like
that.

05:34.270 --> 05:40.199
I mean from these norms that you have about
beauty and all this nonsense.

05:40.199 --> 05:48.220
But when you see a person full of vibrations,
she gives you such tranquility, such joy.

05:48.220 --> 05:55.449
Don’t disturb it by having your pre-married
ideas about your wife you see.

05:55.449 --> 06:02.070
The reality is this is your wife and you are
her husband.

06:02.070 --> 06:05.490
Take the reality into consideration.

06:05.490 --> 06:09.650
Not some imaginary image you have about your
wife.

06:09.650 --> 06:10.910
Your wife is before you, she’s your wife.

06:10.910 --> 06:13.810
What’s the use of having imaginary ideas
you will never enjoy your married life, I

06:13.810 --> 06:21.610
mean if you have imagination, then you should
not even marry: marry your imagination is

06:21.610 --> 06:23.370
a better way.

06:23.370 --> 06:26.250
Why to ruin somebody’s life, why to make
somebody miserable?

06:26.250 --> 06:32.449
They are all intelligent and good Sahaja yoginis.

06:32.449 --> 06:39.250
We have seen to it they are all very good
Sahaja Yoginis.

06:39.250 --> 06:44.600
But once you try to misbehave with your wife
or try to create problems for us, naturally

06:44.600 --> 06:50.340
we don’t want you any more in Sahaja Yoga,
because it is getting too much and you know

06:50.340 --> 06:56.750
as it is not easy to marry you, to get your
visas, to take you down there its quite a

06:56.750 --> 07:00.610
lot of work one has to go into it.

07:00.610 --> 07:07.340
So now don’t think that you have been forced
into any marriage, you have been asked into

07:07.340 --> 07:08.780
any marriage, please.

07:08.780 --> 07:23.680
If you give up this kind of an imaginary ideas
about this marriage, again and again I am

07:23.680 --> 07:31.290
telling to you today now and this time also,
this present moment, all those who feel that

07:31.290 --> 07:33.599
way should immediately tell me, I will be
extremely happy.

07:33.599 --> 07:36.900
There is another third thing that I have seen
about the western people is that they are

07:36.900 --> 07:37.900
literally frightened of marriage, literally
frightened.

07:37.900 --> 07:45.509
First is they may live with a woman for 10
days or 20 days or 10 years, but as soon as

07:45.509 --> 07:53.979
they get married they go for a divorce, very
funny(??).

07:53.979 --> 08:03.069
For this I think the law is responsible, because
the women think they will get money out of

08:03.069 --> 08:10.039
their husbands may be or the husbands think
that they will get money out of their wives.

08:10.039 --> 08:29.220
In Sahaja Yoga if you want to take the divorce
later on, which I don’t like at all.

08:29.220 --> 08:34.979
We have only 1 % divorces, then I would not
allow you to extract money from the other,

08:34.979 --> 08:39.180
never, and nor the girl should extract money
from you.

08:39.180 --> 08:52.980
Last but not the least is important that,
once you are married, now the girls may not

08:52.980 --> 09:02.670
be able to go immediately from their various
places because of visa problems, but don’t

09:02.670 --> 09:13.190
give them money to be sent to their families,
that is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

09:13.190 --> 09:19.940
The girl should not send their money to their
parents that’s not allowed and trouble the

09:19.940 --> 09:21.570
husband for that.

09:21.570 --> 09:27.100
Sometimes if you want to send is alright,
but there should not be regular remittance

09:27.100 --> 09:35.890
all the time and this is sometimes comes to
my notice which I do not want to encourage.

09:35.890 --> 09:45.300
As far as that part is concerned you should
not give any money for sending it to the relations

09:45.300 --> 09:57.510
of your wife otherwise it will become a money
oriented marriage and people would marry because

09:57.510 --> 09:58.510
they can extract some money from it.

09:58.510 --> 09:59.510
All these things should be kept in to it,
that we are now married, we are stupid if

09:59.510 --> 10:05.600
we want to have a divorce, stupid.

10:05.600 --> 10:13.339
and I don’t like divorce at all.

10:13.339 --> 10:21.389
Though I allow because sometimes I find horrible
things happening.

10:21.389 --> 10:33.160
But rarely I would allow anybody to have a
divorce, rarely, so this idea should be given

10:33.160 --> 10:35.720
up and one should not be selfish…

10:35.720 --> 10:42.339
But from the very beginning if you try to
be very kind and nice, I am sure things will

10:42.339 --> 10:43.339
work out.

10:43.339 --> 10:53.200
We have to prove to the world that marriage
is a divine institution and by this divine

10:53.200 --> 11:00.260
institution if you have been put together
it’s also a divine plan.

11:00.260 --> 11:03.700
And through this divine plan many things are
going to work out.

11:03.700 --> 11:06.350
So those who are getting married today are
helping Sahaja Yoga very much.

11:06.350 --> 11:13.279
I have already told you there are many saints
who want to be married.

11:13.279 --> 11:16.360
And nowadays that you see this world full
of horrible people.

11:16.360 --> 11:34.500
We need so many saints to be born and so the
saints will be born in case you have good

11:34.500 --> 11:37.410
married time, happy married life and enjoyable
life.

11:37.410 --> 11:42.380
I think all this lecturing is of no use unless
and until you start enjoying your married

11:42.380 --> 11:43.380
life.

11:43.380 --> 11:44.380
There are such sweet things I need not tell
you.

11:44.380 --> 11:48.240
I was surprised that there is no book in English
language which describes the romance after

11:48.240 --> 11:55.710
marriage, I was surprised, no book, can you
imagine? and in India you won’t find any

11:55.710 --> 11:59.209
books which describe the romance before the
marriage.

11:59.209 --> 12:10.410
Nowadays they have started doing some sort
of stupid things but normally no question.

12:10.410 --> 12:17.850
So now it is for you, enjoy your married life
much more than you have enjoyed your childhood,

12:17.850 --> 12:22.810
your youth or any other times in college,
schools, anywhere.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.790
So be prepared.

12:24.790 --> 12:30.060
Make yourself friendly, ??open it, open your
heart.

12:30.060 --> 12:32.709
Don’t try to find faults in your wife.

12:32.709 --> 12:35.810
I mean some things she doesn’t know, some
things you don’t know.

12:35.810 --> 12:36.810
Doesn’t matter.

12:36.810 --> 12:39.579
All the time trying to find faults makes you
faulty.

12:39.579 --> 12:41.079
Don’t find faults.

12:41.079 --> 12:49.699
If you see somebody doing something wrong,
suppose if you find that person is trying

12:49.699 --> 12:51.949
to do something.

12:51.949 --> 12:58.610
All right, you just do it your self or don’t
tell.

12:58.610 --> 13:04.829
Gradually she will learn from you what is
the right way is.

13:04.829 --> 13:08.590
And one should make fun of these moments,
for example I don’t know how to do any banking,

13:08.590 --> 13:09.590
write a cheque.

13:09.590 --> 13:16.589
I am very bad at many things you see, can’t
even open a television, I can’t even the

13:16.589 --> 13:17.970
air conditioner.

13:17.970 --> 13:20.810
So many things I just can’t do.

13:20.810 --> 13:21.810
Doesn’t matter.

13:21.810 --> 13:22.839
My husband also equally the same.

13:22.839 --> 13:24.110
So we enjoy each other.

13:24.110 --> 13:26.650
All part and parcel of Sahaja Yoga.

13:26.650 --> 13:30.240
One unit here, one unit there, one unit there.

13:30.240 --> 13:36.709
But they are in the same ocean of spirituality.

13:36.709 --> 13:44.380
So any Sahaja Yogi who comes to your house
or any one, especially Indian women you will

13:44.380 --> 13:45.420
find, they will look after the guests very
well.

13:45.420 --> 13:49.440
And then there is some sort of a thing called
jealousy comes out…

13:49.440 --> 13:51.360
it’s very absurd.

13:51.360 --> 13:56.830
Indian women will not have anybody else as
their husbands but their own.

13:56.830 --> 13:57.830
It is then worked out.

13:57.830 --> 13:59.760
So don’t have these funny ideas that she
is very friendly, she is looking after other

13:59.760 --> 14:00.760
people, this and that.

14:00.760 --> 14:05.620
This kind of a nonsense should not be there.

14:05.620 --> 14:14.139
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have those things,
we have become very pure, their eyes are pure.

14:14.139 --> 14:16.960
So don’t have any doubts about your wives.

14:16.960 --> 14:23.250
Same with the wives I will tell you.

14:23.250 --> 14:28.279
This will make your life very much more happier
and confident.

14:28.279 --> 14:36.389
If you have any problem you can always write
to me directly, need not even.

14:36.389 --> 14:45.460
tell through your leaders you can directly
write to me if you really have problem.

14:45.460 --> 15:00.930
But I think you are all intelligent people,
you should be able to sort out everything.
