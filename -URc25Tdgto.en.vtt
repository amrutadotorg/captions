00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:10.900
The purpose of these marriages is this, that
we should have international understanding

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:22.490
about human beings that after coming to Sahaja
Yoga we transcend all the barriers, all the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:31.460
barriers of race, religion, ?? and nationality.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:45.480
We have to create this homogenous world and
make it peaceful by removing this disease

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.700
of national identification or racial identification.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.410
We are all created by God Almighty.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.570
Our differences are only skin deep.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.039
Culturally we are different little bit here
and there but basically in ourselves we are

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:07.039
all spiritual.

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:23.619
And the religion that you have is innate built
in within us which is an part and parcel of

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:24.619
us.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:32.189
By these marriages we want to achieve a very
happy and a very enjoyable married life.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:42.560
In the marriage one has to know, nobody should
dominate anyone… that’s a wrong idea.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.000
But we have two wheels of the chariot, one
is big and one is small, then the chariot

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.420
will never move forward, it will go round
and round.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.439
Both are equally the same, equal sized, but
they are not similar.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.759
The left cannot be the right and the right
cannot be the left.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.099
So men and women have to be men and women
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.420
They cannot be unisex people.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.420
They cannot be.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:17.620
That’s very important.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.540
The man has to protect the wife, love her,
give her all the security that is needed.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:29.010
And woman has to nourish the husband and give
him all the love and affection she has.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.239
So here we are on the threshold of entering
into a new life where you have a companion

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:38.820
of your own.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.390
She will be your wife.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.989
Not because only she is in Sahaja Yoga that
you have married her but she’s your own.

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:57.870
So try to prove it to her that you love her
very much and that she is your wife and you

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.829
have all that is yours is for her.

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.260
This is very important in the very beginning
of it.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:10.599
Now there’s another thing I have found out
in my experience sometimes that they get married,

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:16.160
I don’t know what happens, they are swayed
into it and they get married.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.549
And after they go back to their own country
they start saying “Mother we know we cannot

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.970
manage, we have to work it out.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.390
This, that” Marriages are now worked out.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:26.850
Spontaneously it happens.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.900
But in India you see we are all the time prepared
for a good married life.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.459
The wife is told, the husband is told all
the time.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.819
So normally when they get married they think
this is what it is for us.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.880
They don’t have love affairs before hand;
they don’t have friends and things.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.500
But even if you had your past, now it’s
finished.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:52.030
You don’t discuss, don’t tell, don’t
talk about it, do your best.

00:03:52.030 --> 00:04:02.569
That’s absolutely wrong because the past
doesn’t exist, what exists is the present.

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:05.709
So enjoy the present, forget it, forgive yourself.

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.359
Many people also have this big problem that
they cannot forget their past and go on telling

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:15.049
their wives that I was like this.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:17.020
There is no need to confess anything.

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.419
They think it is honest.

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:29.880
There is no question of honesty or dishonesty
at that time is but to enjoy full joyous mood

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.190
of marriage.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.880
That’s in the head.

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.380
Otherwise what’s the use of marrying and
then telling stories.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:42.690
Or some people have very bad habit of telling
him how bad the mother was, the father was

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:47.870
or may be that how miserable he is or how
he has gone through struggle…

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.490
there’s no need to talk of this.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.120
At this moment you are married, she is your
wife, and you have to express all your love

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:05.960
and all your attention to her so she feels
secure and happy.

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:07.770
This point please try to note.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.350
Nothing has to be talked about your past.

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:13.000
Then we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:21.479
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis, very great
Sahaja Yogis who are married, very very ordinary

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:24.660
men, very ordinary, ordinary looking superficially.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.449
Or can say some of them could be called as
ugly.

00:05:28.449 --> 00:05:34.270
Some girls are like that, some men are like
that.

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.199
I mean from these norms that you have about
beauty and all this nonsense.

00:05:40.199 --> 00:05:48.220
But when you see a person full of vibrations,
she gives you such tranquility, such joy.

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:55.449
Don’t disturb it by having your pre-married
ideas about your wife you see.

00:05:55.449 --> 00:06:02.070
The reality is this is your wife and you are
her husband.

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.490
Take the reality into consideration.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:09.650
Not some imaginary image you have about your
wife.

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:10.910
Your wife is before you, she’s your wife.

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:13.810
What’s the use of having imaginary ideas
you will never enjoy your married life, I

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:21.610
mean if you have imagination, then you should
not even marry: marry your imagination is

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:23.370
a better way.

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.250
Why to ruin somebody’s life, why to make
somebody miserable?

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:32.449
They are all intelligent and good Sahaja yoginis.

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:39.250
We have seen to it they are all very good
Sahaja Yoginis.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:44.600
But once you try to misbehave with your wife
or try to create problems for us, naturally

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.340
we don’t want you any more in Sahaja Yoga,
because it is getting too much and you know

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:56.750
as it is not easy to marry you, to get your
visas, to take you down there its quite a

00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:00.610
lot of work one has to go into it.

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:07.340
So now don’t think that you have been forced
into any marriage, you have been asked into

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:08.780
any marriage, please.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:23.680
If you give up this kind of an imaginary ideas
about this marriage, again and again I am

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:31.290
telling to you today now and this time also,
this present moment, all those who feel that

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:33.599
way should immediately tell me, I will be
extremely happy.

00:07:33.599 --> 00:07:36.900
There is another third thing that I have seen
about the western people is that they are

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:37.900
literally frightened of marriage, literally
frightened.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:45.509
First is they may live with a woman for 10
days or 20 days or 10 years, but as soon as

00:07:45.509 --> 00:07:53.979
they get married they go for a divorce, very
funny(??).

00:07:53.979 --> 00:08:03.069
For this I think the law is responsible, because
the women think they will get money out of

00:08:03.069 --> 00:08:10.039
their husbands may be or the husbands think
that they will get money out of their wives.

00:08:10.039 --> 00:08:29.220
In Sahaja Yoga if you want to take the divorce
later on, which I don’t like at all.

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.979
We have only 1 % divorces, then I would not
allow you to extract money from the other,

00:08:34.979 --> 00:08:39.180
never, and nor the girl should extract money
from you.

00:08:39.180 --> 00:08:52.980
Last but not the least is important that,
once you are married, now the girls may not

00:08:52.980 --> 00:09:02.670
be able to go immediately from their various
places because of visa problems, but don’t

00:09:02.670 --> 00:09:13.190
give them money to be sent to their families,
that is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:19.940
The girl should not send their money to their
parents that’s not allowed and trouble the

00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:21.570
husband for that.

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:27.100
Sometimes if you want to send is alright,
but there should not be regular remittance

00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:35.890
all the time and this is sometimes comes to
my notice which I do not want to encourage.

00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:45.300
As far as that part is concerned you should
not give any money for sending it to the relations

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:57.510
of your wife otherwise it will become a money
oriented marriage and people would marry because

00:09:57.510 --> 00:09:58.510
they can extract some money from it.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.510
All these things should be kept in to it,
that we are now married, we are stupid if

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:05.600
we want to have a divorce, stupid.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:13.339
and I don’t like divorce at all.

00:10:13.339 --> 00:10:21.389
Though I allow because sometimes I find horrible
things happening.

00:10:21.389 --> 00:10:33.160
But rarely I would allow anybody to have a
divorce, rarely, so this idea should be given

00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.720
up and one should not be selfish…

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:42.339
But from the very beginning if you try to
be very kind and nice, I am sure things will

00:10:42.339 --> 00:10:43.339
work out.

00:10:43.339 --> 00:10:53.200
We have to prove to the world that marriage
is a divine institution and by this divine

00:10:53.200 --> 00:11:00.260
institution if you have been put together
it’s also a divine plan.

00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:03.700
And through this divine plan many things are
going to work out.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.350
So those who are getting married today are
helping Sahaja Yoga very much.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:13.279
I have already told you there are many saints
who want to be married.

00:11:13.279 --> 00:11:16.360
And nowadays that you see this world full
of horrible people.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:34.500
We need so many saints to be born and so the
saints will be born in case you have good

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.410
married time, happy married life and enjoyable
life.

00:11:37.410 --> 00:11:42.380
I think all this lecturing is of no use unless
and until you start enjoying your married

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:43.380
life.

00:11:43.380 --> 00:11:44.380
There are such sweet things I need not tell
you.

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.240
I was surprised that there is no book in English
language which describes the romance after

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:55.710
marriage, I was surprised, no book, can you
imagine? and in India you won’t find any

00:11:55.710 --> 00:11:59.209
books which describe the romance before the
marriage.

00:11:59.209 --> 00:12:10.410
Nowadays they have started doing some sort
of stupid things but normally no question.

00:12:10.410 --> 00:12:17.850
So now it is for you, enjoy your married life
much more than you have enjoyed your childhood,

00:12:17.850 --> 00:12:22.810
your youth or any other times in college,
schools, anywhere.

00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:24.790
So be prepared.

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:30.060
Make yourself friendly, ??open it, open your
heart.

00:12:30.060 --> 00:12:32.709
Don’t try to find faults in your wife.

00:12:32.709 --> 00:12:35.810
I mean some things she doesn’t know, some
things you don’t know.

00:12:35.810 --> 00:12:36.810
Doesn’t matter.

00:12:36.810 --> 00:12:39.579
All the time trying to find faults makes you
faulty.

00:12:39.579 --> 00:12:41.079
Don’t find faults.

00:12:41.079 --> 00:12:49.699
If you see somebody doing something wrong,
suppose if you find that person is trying

00:12:49.699 --> 00:12:51.949
to do something.

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:58.610
All right, you just do it your self or don’t
tell.

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:04.829
Gradually she will learn from you what is
the right way is.

00:13:04.829 --> 00:13:08.590
And one should make fun of these moments,
for example I don’t know how to do any banking,

00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:09.590
write a cheque.

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:16.589
I am very bad at many things you see, can’t
even open a television, I can’t even the

00:13:16.589 --> 00:13:17.970
air conditioner.

00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.810
So many things I just can’t do.

00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:21.810
Doesn’t matter.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:22.839
My husband also equally the same.

00:13:22.839 --> 00:13:24.110
So we enjoy each other.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:26.650
All part and parcel of Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:26.650 --> 00:13:30.240
One unit here, one unit there, one unit there.

00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:36.709
But they are in the same ocean of spirituality.

00:13:36.709 --> 00:13:44.380
So any Sahaja Yogi who comes to your house
or any one, especially Indian women you will

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:45.420
find, they will look after the guests very
well.

00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.440
And then there is some sort of a thing called
jealousy comes out…

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.360
it’s very absurd.

00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:56.830
Indian women will not have anybody else as
their husbands but their own.

00:13:56.830 --> 00:13:57.830
It is then worked out.

00:13:57.830 --> 00:13:59.760
So don’t have these funny ideas that she
is very friendly, she is looking after other

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:00.760
people, this and that.

00:14:00.760 --> 00:14:05.620
This kind of a nonsense should not be there.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:14.139
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t have those things,
we have become very pure, their eyes are pure.

00:14:14.139 --> 00:14:16.960
So don’t have any doubts about your wives.

00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:23.250
Same with the wives I will tell you.

00:14:23.250 --> 00:14:28.279
This will make your life very much more happier
and confident.

00:14:28.279 --> 00:14:36.389
If you have any problem you can always write
to me directly, need not even.

00:14:36.389 --> 00:14:45.460
tell through your leaders you can directly
write to me if you really have problem.

00:14:45.460 --> 00:15:00.930
But I think you are all intelligent people,
you should be able to sort out everything.
