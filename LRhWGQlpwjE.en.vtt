00:01:00.931 --> 00:01:06.566
Coming down here to convert people. It’s a question of democracy, you see?

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:09.726
Because in a democratic country, if there are more

00:01:09.806 --> 00:01:14.124
majority of the Muslims or Christians,

00:01:15.264 --> 00:01:24.590
then will become the, sort of the rulers, you see?

00:01:24.636 --> 00:01:29.600
So this move is you have to purchase people, convert them,

00:01:32.087 --> 00:01:35.473
and they are worried about it.

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:39.986
I told them Sahaja Yoga is the only way

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:43.677
by which people will settle down into themselves.

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.080
You see, to have such a large majority in this country

00:01:59.437 --> 00:02:05.822
such a large majority, or,

00:02:05.915 --> 00:02:10.518
I should say such a large democracy.

00:02:10.698 --> 00:02:14.351
And democracy, one has to pay a lot, because such,

00:02:14.431 --> 00:02:17.716
such influences might infiltrate, see?

00:02:17.956 --> 00:02:23.348
The Saudi Arabians can come down here and sort of clamp the whole country

00:02:23.401 --> 00:02:29.715
with their own government, possibility is there.

00:02:30.447 --> 00:02:33.834
I mean, they can’t do this in Russia or Poland

00:02:33.914 --> 00:02:37.901
or any place where they sow democracy.

00:02:38.428 --> 00:02:42.880
Which, without democracy people cannot develop.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:48.094
They cannot develop. Like, if a, say a Russian comes here,

00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:52.083
he’s not bothered about yoga or anything, never.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.483
He’s in, in say, if he’s in Bombay

00:02:55.563 --> 00:02:59.435
he’ll ask if there’s a discotheque or something.

00:02:59.818 --> 00:03:04.080
If he comes to the villages he will see how dirty your villages are.

00:03:04.116 --> 00:03:09.120
He is so inconvenient. He has so many problems,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.537
kind of basic, he can never feel the peace.

00:03:12.618 --> 00:03:15.805
He can never feel the peace because they are not developed, you see.

00:03:16.692 --> 00:03:23.086
All such undemocratic countries

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:26.505
have human beings who are not yet developed for Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:26.597 --> 00:03:34.120
They are more bothered, bothered about
things which are of very little importance

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:43.374
in actual spiritual life. So, it’s a very funny situation.

00:03:44.568 --> 00:03:50.156
If you don’t have the democracy, then you do not develop.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.874
Anyone I have seen, coming now by My husband’s job,

00:03:55.934 --> 00:03:59.236
I’ve met all kinds of people all over the world.

00:03:59.277 --> 00:04:03.693
Whatever you may say about Americans, they are seeking God, no doubt.

00:04:03.774 --> 00:04:09.148
A Russian and American, you see from a Sahaja Yoga point of view

00:04:09.255 --> 00:04:15.120
A Russian is absolutely a mediocre, from Sahaja Yoga point of view.

00:04:15.964 --> 00:04:18.760
Because he’s only worried about his personal convenience,

00:04:18.807 --> 00:04:21.286
I mean, is absolutely a hopeless case.

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.726
That is wrong, this is wrong. They can never appreciate the bliss of India.

00:04:27.806 --> 00:04:29.225
They cannot.

00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:39.440
This is very materialistical thing. The whole thing is based on materialism.

00:04:44.128 --> 00:04:49.732
Lady, Czechoslovakian in America, she’s so different.

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:53.220
And she told Me she lives on a tree, you will be amazed.

00:04:53.313 --> 00:04:55.505
She made her house on a tree.

00:04:55.505 --> 00:04:58.417
And she was telling Me that,

00:04:58.498 --> 00:05:03.473
“Mother, when will people be awakened to something better?”

00:05:04.358 --> 00:05:07.581
That’s very — they are not awakened yet.

00:05:09.834 --> 00:05:12.906
Machines, they cannot express themselves for us.

00:05:18.041 --> 00:05:21.611
They are very mundane type, very mundane type.

00:05:25.763 --> 00:05:30.370
Even if they come to Sahaja Yog, they won’t be able to stand it,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:35.280
because what they ask for is not the essence, it’s so superficial.

00:05:37.222 --> 00:05:40.589
In their, in their country if they get one law

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:45.120
which is just like what we give to our cow here,

00:05:45.204 --> 00:05:48.143
then they will come here and they will pass it.

00:05:50.476 --> 00:06:00.320
That’s sort of a ego style behavior, they show off.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:08.506
Tell Me, in democracy countries…
