Public Program
Cairns, Australia

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.550
March 9, 1990

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.480
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:41.480
At the very outset, we have to understand
that truth is what it is. We cannot organize

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.589
it, order it, or conceptualize it. It has
been, it is and it will be. And we cannot

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:17.030
know it through our human awareness, through
our mental capacities, emotional projections,

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:25.439
imaginary thinking. It has to be perceived,
and to be experienced on our central nervous

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.920
system. As in our evolution we have grown,
slowly developing into human state, also we

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.680
have to grow a little more to become the spirit
state. When I am talking to you about this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:02.490
mechanism, which is a subtle mechanism within
us, you have to have the attitude of a scientist

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:16.700
who has an open mind, and to accept whatever
I am saying as a hypothesis. And then if it

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:25.660
is proved, as honest people you have to accept
it, because this is for our benevolence, benevolence

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:35.670
of our countrymen, emancipation of the whole
humanity; because within us is placed this

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.430
subtle mechanism.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:53.430
This time is so special, I feel, because there
are so many seekers of truth. Before this,

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:03.370
people used to run after so many other things.
First, for the security they had all kinds

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.230
of clubs and all kinds of arrangements made
that you should feel secured from nature,

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:21.269
from natural crisis, from animals; and then
they developed other organizations just to

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.010
feel their power and their money-orientation.
Now the time has come for us to see that all

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.799
these things do not lead us to a very happy
life. We have so many problems, so many tensions,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.970
and so many diseases endless – and very
new type of incurable diseases that have come

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:01.360
in. I don’t know how far Stephen has told
you about the centers, but all these six centers

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:07.650
that are pierced through, through this power
which is within us: this is the power of pure

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:14.650
desire. So far, whatever desires we had are
not pure. If they were, we would have felt

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:22.750
satisfied about them. But as you know, economics
says that the
desires are not satiable in general. Wants

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.560
are not satiable in general – means you
want something today, then you want something

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:45.560
tomorrow, then you want something later on.
If you get something, then you do not enjoy

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:50.250
that for which you were hankering, then you
want to have something else. That shows this

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:57.250
is not pure desire, but a desire which leads
you to another desire.

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.639
So this is the power of pure desire lying
within you, and she is your mother: your own

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:16.740
mother, an individual mother, reflected within
you. We can say this is the Holy Ghost reflected

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:24.780
in you. We have very mysterious ideas about
Holy Ghost – is not that mysterious. There’s

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:32.139
God Almighty as the Father, then we have Son,
the God, and what about the Trinity is that

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:45.750
the third one is a Holy Ghost. That has to
be the Primordial Mother – has to be, logically.

00:05:47.039 --> 00:05:54.039
But somehow people avoided talking of women,
and they didn’t want to show that the mother

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:01.509
is such an important thing. Not in all the
religions: like in Hinduism or, say, in Buddhism,

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:12.160
every religion, they worshipped Mother as
the creator of the whole universe, and that

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:21.169
God Almighty is just the witness. Also you
can see Christ, how He emphasized, that when

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:25.349
He was dying on the cross said, “Behold
the Mother.”

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:32.069
So this Primordial Mother is the mother which
is within us reflected as the kundalini. And

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:39.069
when she rises, this kundalini, when she rises
and pierces through the fontanel bone area,

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:47.289
she gives you the actualization of baptism.
You get connected with that subtle energy

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:53.759
which is surrounding us, about which everybody
has talked: even in Koran it’s called as

00:06:53.759 --> 00:07:00.449
ruh. Kundalini is called as assas. In every
scripture there’s a description of a kundalini

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:06.470
of some way or other, or of this mechanism,
as in the Bible is that there is a Tree of

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:10.919
Life within us. Even in Gita is described
a Tree of Life.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:17.919
So every religion has described this mechanism,
plus it has always said that you must seek

00:07:18.569 --> 00:07:25.099
yourself, that you should have your second
birth. But people just certified themselves

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:32.099
as “we are something born again” you can
call it, “we are brahmins” or they can

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:40.180
call themselves that “we are realized souls.”
But by false certificate you do not become.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:47.180
It’s a question of becoming. You have to
become; it’s not just giving a false certificate

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:53.310
about it that we are something and they are
something. It is so obvious and evident, you

00:07:53.310 --> 00:08:00.310
can see it, that anybody follows any religion
whatsoever is capable of committing any sin.

00:08:01.319 --> 00:08:07.300
There’s no bondage of the religion that
they follow. That means it’s all outside,

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.330
it’s not innate within us; and the religion
has to be innate.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:18.240
And I call it as the valency of human beings,
that human beings have ten valencies. And

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.419
when this kundalini rises, she enlightens
those ten valencies in this area that you

00:08:23.419 --> 00:08:30.199
see – the green area, Void, you see – it
enlightens all that, and that’s how you

00:08:30.199 --> 00:08:37.199
just become a righteous person. You become
righteous, you become virtuous and you are

00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:45.280
proud of it, but you do not try to aggress
others with it. You enjoy them, because you

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:55.590
are so compassionate that you want to be sharing
it with others and enjoying it with others.

00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:04.370
A new personality is evolved out of us. I
always say, like a pond, sometimes we feel

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:14.250
that our lives have become so much full of
miseries and troubles, as in a pond we see

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:21.250
lots of creatures creeping around; but when
the lotus blooms out it fills the whole pond

00:09:23.310 --> 00:09:27.310
and transforms it with the fragrance that
it has.

00:09:27.310 --> 00:09:34.230
In the same way it happens to us, such a transformation.
First of all is the simple one, where physical

00:09:34.230 --> 00:09:41.230
being improves, automatically – not by any
medicine, not by anything else, but your own

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.810
power. It’s your own power that cures you.
You don’t have to take any medicines for

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:51.320
it, you don’t have to pay for it because
it’s a living process, as I told you. So

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:57.320
you don’t have to go to any doctor, you
just know the diagnosis yourself and you get

00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:03.720
cured yourself. You can cure yourself, you
can cure others, because you are realized

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:07.600
and you can give realizations to others, so
they get cured, too.

00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:14.600
Then the mental problems like schizophrenia
and all these things just disappear. If there

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:20.050
is tension, it is – he must have told you
about the ego and superego, because they cover

00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:27.050
your head. But when it opens out, all your
worries, all your attentions pass out, and

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:34.920
you become a person who can be called as a
person of thoughtless awareness. Means you

00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:44.210
watch something: you don’t think about it,
you just see it – just seeing, the witnessing

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:51.210
part. And that is the greatest thing that
happens, because if you want you can think,

00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:54.720
but if you don’t want you don’t have to
think, you just have to watch.

00:10:54.720 --> 00:11:01.720
Now you see a beautiful carpet lying here.
Supposing I had possessed this carpet or supposing

00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.980
I was of a normal type, I would have been
worried that is it insured or not and may

00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:13.350
be spoilt, or something like that. And if
it had belonged to somebody else I would have

00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:17.330
been thinking, “Oh, how will I purchase
this, where can I get it?” and all kinds

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:23.190
of thoughts; but the beauty of this carpet
I’m not enjoying. But once I have developed

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:29.320
this witness state I look at it. And I look
at it and what I see is the beauty, because

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:36.320
it acts on Me: the beauty, the creation, the
joy of that creation, everything acts and

00:11:37.130 --> 00:11:42.190
I soothe down with that beauty completely,
as if there are rivers flowing on My head

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:49.190
of complete joy. And this is what we have
to enjoy in this new personality.

00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:56.700
Then one has to know that we are peace, because
spirit is the source of peace. Once you become

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:03.600
the spirit, the spirit comes into your attention
and you become a very peaceful person. It’s

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.620
like you are on the periphery, like on the
wheel: if you are on the periphery you are

00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:14.970
moving all the time, but the center of the
wheel is absolutely peaceful. So, as if you

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.770
jump on to your center, from there you’ll
see all the movement of the wheel, but you

00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:26.770
are in the center and you are not disturbed.
You can see the problems very easy to be handled.

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:34.150
We can give another analogy, that’s supposing
you are standing in the waves, then you are

00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:39.500
afraid of the waves, that you might be drowned;
but supposing you get on to a boat then you

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:45.870
start seeing these waves. But supposing you
know how to swim, then you can jump in and

00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:52.100
save people who are getting drowned. In the
same way, we are lost in the waves of our

00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:59.100
thoughts. But once we become the witness,
we see our problems much more clearly and

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:06.330
that’s how we know also the solutions, and
things work out. Above all, you become the

00:13:06.610 --> 00:13:13.610
joy. You become the joy, a pure joy; not the
joy outwardly which has to be thought and

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:19.360
is to be – see, you, some see paintings,
they say, “Oh, you must see this is this,

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.660
this is … ” – nothing of the kind. Nobody
need tell you what is this painting is about,

00:13:23.660 --> 00:13:28.740
you just see the painting and you see it,
and you get all the joy out of that within

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.440
you. So you become a source of joy for everyone
else.

00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:38.010
But the greatest thing that happens, that
you get connected to this all-pervading Power

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:45.010
– this Power that organizes everything,
that does all living work, that thinks for

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:55.680
us, is very gentle, and also can destroy whichever
is against construction. It can destroy all

00:14:01.250 --> 00:14:08.250
evil things. And it loves you. So you get
connected to that energy, that vital energy

00:14:09.460 --> 00:14:16.460
– it starts flowing through you, so you
do not feel tired, you are dynamic, you are

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:27.820
compassionate, at the same time at peace with
yourself. That is the wonderful thing that

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:35.240
we are; we are made that way. Only we have
to know ourselves, like this instrument has

00:14:36.170 --> 00:14:42.160
to go to the mains: in the same way we have
to be connected to the mains, and that’s

00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:46.140
how we know what glorious things we are.

00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:52.520
Today is the only day I am here, I am sorry
I couldn’t spend more time. But I hope to

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:59.510
come back again sometime, maybe in May, because
I didn’t know there was such a response

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:06.510
here, and such nice people living in this
place who are so responsive to truth. So I’m

00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:15.140
here with you and for a short time, and in
this short lecture I cannot tell you all about

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:21.560
it – it’s an ocean of knowledge – but
we have lots of tapes which you can hear and

00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:27.950
understand Sahaja Yoga. But in any case I
would like you to ask Me questions before

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:34.950
we go in for this process of Self-realization.
That will take about ten minutes only.

00:15:44.180 --> 00:15:49.240
The questions should be relevant because I
have come here to give you your own beauty.

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:56.240
I’ve not come here to ask for votes or anything
like that! So it should be relevant with the

00:15:58.830 --> 00:16:05.830
subject, and should be helpful to you as well
as to Me to know what are the problems are.

00:16:10.150 --> 00:16:17.150
[Question about possible damage from kundalini
awakening.]

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:41.690
Kundalini awakening never damages you. But
as far as the bad management is concerned,

00:16:41.690 --> 00:16:48.690
a person who has no authority to raise kundalini
tries to do some nonsensical things, naturally

00:16:49.300 --> 00:16:56.110
there is a damage because they have no authority,
divine authority, and they are doing the job.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:03.110
But so far there are so many Sahaja yogis
all over the world, and also the Sahaja yogis

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:10.559
have given realizations to people. It doesn’t
do damage. It’s your mother. And when you

00:17:10.559 --> 00:17:17.280
were born she took up all the labor upon all
herself, she took up all the pains upon herself

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:23.270
and saw that you were not hurt. In the same
way this mother, she knows everything about

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:28.700
you, she’s the loving mother, the most loving
mother, and she is not going to bother you

00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:35.700
at all.

00:17:36.050 --> 00:17:41.490
Some people do write like that, that “kundalini
awakening is very difficult, it will do you

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:46.580
damage” and all that. It is only just, just
to see that people don’t get their realization:

00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:50.950
it’s just to frighten, or maybe it’s a
money-oriented nonsense. Must be that they

00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:54.320
must be wanting to frighten you that “you
are sinful, you are useless, you’d better

00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.850
give us money so that maybe your kundalini
might rise” or something. I have seen some

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:05.250
people who cannot get realization or anything,
they come and tell Me, “Mother, I must be

00:18:05.250 --> 00:18:06.250
very sinful person.”

00:18:06.250 --> 00:18:07.450
I said, “Who told you that?”

00:18:07.450 --> 00:18:09.030
“Certain guru has told me.”

00:18:09.030 --> 00:18:13.260
I said, “You go and tell him back that ‘you
are the most sinful person ever born.’”

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:18.980
So all these ideas are coming up on people
who are very simple-hearted and gullible,

00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:24.860
because they believe all this nonsense and
they just succumb to it – but it’s not

00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:31.860
so. I told you, you are glorious and beautiful;
please believe Me in that.

00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:41.440
[Question: What chakra is related to integrity?
And how to work on that chakra to keep oneself

00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:55.580
strong?]

00:18:55.580 --> 00:19:02.580
Integrity? You see, integrity is not one particular
chakra, but it’s the experience. What happens,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:11.280
you get the experience of realization, so
that you start feeling the cool breeze, the

00:19:11.410 --> 00:19:18.300
vibrations of the Holy Ghost, you can say,
or of the ruh surrounding you, and you start

00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:25.300
enjoying it. You just enjoy it, and you don’t
want to give it up. You don’t want to give

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:34.640
it up, because you enjoy it. That’s how
the integrity develops. There is no stamping

00:19:36.570 --> 00:19:42.320
like that, that you have to be integrated,
or you have to be into the integrity – it’s

00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.380
not there.

00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:50.260
But the integration does take place, because
all these chakras get a sort of a kundalini

00:19:50.260 --> 00:19:56.660
inside them, which like a thread passes through
all these beautiful pearls. So that’s integration

00:19:56.660 --> 00:20:02.640
is there. But integrity part comes through
your own depth, first of all. If you touch

00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:08.440
your depth, you just never leave Sahaja Yoga.
Some people do leave Sahaja Yoga because of

00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:13.350
very superficial reasons sometimes, but again
they want to come back. You see, the trouble

00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:20.350
is, they leave it and then again come back,
because it’s such a source of joy. They

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:27.320
are allowed to leave and they, sometimes we
have to ask some people to leave because they

00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:31.720
can be very destructive people – some are
very destructive people who come to Sahaja

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:37.750
Yoga – but all of them then get cleared
out and come back again. So it grows.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:44.750
There’s no force, of anything. Like somebody
told Me that she said that “I’ll take

00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:51.850
fifty dollars for a course in Sahaj Yoga.”

00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:53.520
I said, “Why did you say so?”

00:20:53.520 --> 00:21:00.360
She said, “You see, people relate to it
better, and they all came for the program.

00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:05.830
And I gave the course and afterwards I returned
all the money, because you can’t take money.

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:11.320
I played the tape” – where I said you
can’t pay for living things – “so I

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:18.320
returned the money.” But that fifty dollars,
according to her, pinpointed them to this.

00:21:18.530 --> 00:21:24.170
I don’t think so it’s necessary, but she
made an experiment like that, that how people

00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:29.600
stick on because they have paid for. Like
we go to see a film and the film is horrid,

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:35.040
but because we have paid for we sit till we
are finished with the nonsense, you see – that’s

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.390
the nature. But I don’t think in Sahaja
Yoga we have ever done that, but she said

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:46.390
that she experimented and it worked with people.
But I have better hopes.

00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:54.850
[Question: What is difference between Sahaja
Yoga and Raja Yoga?]

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:08.600
Sahaja Yoga is the complete integration of
all the yogas. When the kundalini rises, then

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:16.400
it has to be held up at every center, you
see: like it passes through the first, the

00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:22.610
second center, then the third center, so the
second center has to go into augmentation

00:22:22.610 --> 00:22:28.070
to the constriction, so the kundalini doesn’t
fall. Then it rises to the fourth center,

00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:33.160
then the third center goes into augmentation.
But it’s very quick, it’s very quick.

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:38.680
It happens as if when you start your car,
ignite, then all the machinery starts working

00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:41.130
automatically – in the same way it works.

00:22:41.130 --> 00:22:48.130
But modern Raja Yoga is something very different:
what they do is to stop the chakras, without

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:56.330
starting the kundalini. They, even up to the
point that the kundalini when it passes through

00:22:56.330 --> 00:23:02.520
this center of Vishuddhi, then your tongue
is a little bit pulled inside for stopping

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:06.600
it from falling down. But you don’t feel
it at all, you’ll see that you’ll not

00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:12.340
feel anything of the kind; because it goes
like a jet in people, I’ve seen, you just

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:17.520
don’t feel all this thing. So because they
must have read about it, they cut their tongues,

00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:24.520
the thread, and push back their tongues. And
I was amazed that in Los Angeles there are

00:23:26.900 --> 00:23:32.130
some doctors from India whose tongues are
wagging like dogs – they can’t speak.

00:23:32.130 --> 00:23:38.130
And this is what is absolutely wrong, that
when the car has not yet started, what’s

00:23:38.130 --> 00:23:43.670
the use of moving the wheels? You spoil the
car – is artificial.

00:23:43.670 --> 00:23:49.920
Yoga cannot be artificial. It has to be a
living process, it has to be spontaneous.

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:56.260
“Yoga” means the union with the Divine.
And I have seen people who have been to Raja

00:23:56.260 --> 00:24:03.260
Yoga have suffered a lot. This is not Raja
Yog. Even Hatha Yoga is not there. “Ha”

00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:10.440
and “tha” is two nadis: is the right-side
nadi is the one which we call as the Surya

00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.780
Nadi, meaning the Sun Nadi, is “ha”; and
“tha” is the left-side nadi, which is

00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:22.780
the channel of pure, we can say it’s the
channel of desire, and is the power of desire.

00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:32.110
So these both things are to be worked out
simultaneously, so that you achieve the yoga.

00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:39.110
Now, Patanjali wrote about it long time back,
and the Patanjali Yoga just has ashtangas,

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:44.550
means there are eight parts which is such
a big book, and eight parts to it, out of

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:49.000
which a very wee, wee part of it is called
“yaman yamah”: out of that a very wee

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:54.350
part is the exercises. And that too is to
be applied only in case when the kundalini

00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:59.930
starts, you know where it stops, and if there
is any physical problem, then only you are

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:05.500
supposed to do. But these days I find the
way people doing Hatha Yoga is something like

00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:11.170
taking all the medicines from the medicine
box like mad, and they develop horrible problems

00:25:11.170 --> 00:25:17.130
because is only the right-side one. And some
of the Hatha yogis are so hot-tempered that

00:25:17.130 --> 00:25:24.130
if you have to approach them, one has to take
a bargepole! We had one fellow called Mr.

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:31.820
Brahmachari in India who was a very well-known
Hatha yogi, and he ended up in creating a

00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:38.440
big factory of arms and ammunitions. I think
it was too much for him inside the arms and

00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.270
ammunitions, so he thought he’d better produce
more of that.

00:25:42.270 --> 00:25:47.590
So it is something that is very one-sided,
and can create people who are very dry. Such

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:54.590
people can go in for very bad married lives;
they might end up with very hot temper, bad

00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:01.600
livers, asthma, liver, and also the very bad
massive attacks of the heart could be there,

00:26:02.130 --> 00:26:09.130
because it’s only one side. You have to
be in balance.

00:26:10.590 --> 00:26:16.830
[Inaudible question]

00:26:16.830 --> 00:26:23.830
Can you hear?

00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:33.190
[Question: If one has a problem in one particular
chakra, you don’t necessarily focus on that

00:26:41.730 --> 00:26:42.150
chakra, you must focus on the whole?]

00:26:42.150 --> 00:26:46.450
No, no question of focusing. You see, what
happens that the kundalini rises, and a person

00:26:46.450 --> 00:26:52.300
who is giving you realization can see clearly.
You can even sometimes see this triangular

00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:57.240
bone pulsating like a heart. And you can see
the kundalini rising, and you can see the

00:26:57.240 --> 00:27:03.220
movement of that energy. If it stops at a
point – also you can feel it on your fingertips,

00:27:03.220 --> 00:27:07.020
because of collective consciousness – then
what you have to do is to just to correct

00:27:07.020 --> 00:27:14.020
that center at that moment; then it rises.

00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:22.230
[Question: The colors of the chakras are basically
the colors of the spectrum?]

00:27:44.270 --> 00:27:51.270
Yes. That’s the color you have. It’s gold,
you see, it is a golden color.

00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:07.440
[Question about Karma Yoga.]

00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:12.700
Karma Yoga? Now, Karma Yoga is a thing that
is said that whatever – this is a Shri Krishna’s

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:19.700
preachings – that whatever karmas you do,
you have to do the karma, you have to do.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:26.690
But He is, He was a divine diplomat and He
knew that human beings are not straightforward,

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.940
so He had to go round the way. But between
the lines we must learn that first thing He

00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:38.940
said, whatever karmas you do – I mean, He
was not a modern shopkeeper, so first He talked

00:28:41.210 --> 00:28:46.370
about gyana yoga, meaning “to know”: is
“knowledge”, “know.” “Know” word

00:28:46.370 --> 00:28:53.040
comes from the Sanskrit word “gn, gn”
as we call it. And you know the early Christians

00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:59.860
were called as Gnostics, meaning “who knew
it on their central nervous system.” And

00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:05.140
from the same comes the word “vida” from
where the Veda is made, or “Buddha” means

00:29:05.140 --> 00:29:12.140
the bodha: is in the Buddhist style they call
it “bodha”, from where the word “Buddha”

00:29:13.030 --> 00:29:16.450
comes in. “Buddha” means “the one who
is enlightened.”

00:29:16.450 --> 00:29:22.570
So you have to be enlightened on your central
nervous system, that is the thing is. So He

00:29:22.570 --> 00:29:28.590
said, first you seek the gyana. But then He
talked about the karma to Arjuna; He said

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:34.440
that “you must do your karmas.” But the
condition was that whatever karmas you do,

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:41.440
whatever work you do, you leave it at the
feet of the Lord. That’s impossible, because

00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:47.179
if you are doing something you always feel
“I am doing it.” Even if you say “No,

00:29:47.179 --> 00:29:53.390
I leave it at the feet of Lord” – is not
so. Only after realization it happens. After

00:29:53.390 --> 00:29:58.559
realization you don’t say that “I’m
doing it.” It just works out this way – “now

00:29:58.559 --> 00:30:03.110
it’s working, it’s going” – they talk
in third line, third person, as if something

00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:10.110
else is doing it. We are just as mediums or
some sort of a instrument in between, and

00:30:10.790 --> 00:30:14.500
it’s working; it’s not doing, it’s not
happening.

00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:20.760
So after realization the karma becomes akarma,
means “non-action”: that you don’t think

00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:27.530
you are doing anything, it just works. And
that’s why this Kriya Yoga is against Sahaja

00:30:27.530 --> 00:30:33.730
Yoga. Sahaja Yoga is akriya, where there is
no action; just you think it’s happening,

00:30:33.730 --> 00:30:37.500
it’s there. You see it, you just, you are
a witness of the whole thing.

00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:42.750
So here, what happens that when the kundalini
rises, when she goes to the Agnya Chakra which

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:49.750
represents, as you say, the third eye or whatever
you may call it – it is between the optic

00:30:49.950 --> 00:30:56.950
chiasma, and it looks after the pituitary
and the pineal body. And as a result we have

00:30:57.240 --> 00:31:04.240
developed two institutions called ego and
superego. The ego is the one which tells us

00:31:04.690 --> 00:31:11.690
“I have done it. I am doing this.” Both
these institutions are sucked in by the enlightenment

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:19.309
of this center and that’s how the thing
opens out, and all your karmas are sucked

00:31:19.309 --> 00:31:26.190
in, so there’s no problem of karmas. Only
human beings think that they are doing karmas;

00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:32.110
animals don’t. They have no sense of sin
or anything. They are completely under the

00:31:32.110 --> 00:31:36.970
bondage of God, so in Sanskrit they are called
as “pashu” – means “under the bondage.”

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:42.010
But we are the ones, we have got freedom.
And that’s why we think we have done this

00:31:42.010 --> 00:31:45.970
and we have done that; and we should not do
this, we should not do that.

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:52.380
But when the kundalini rises and she awakens
this center, then both these things are sucked

00:31:52.380 --> 00:31:59.380
in. And when they are sucked in, then you
do not do any karmas anymore, you just are

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:05.400
in akarma. You do everything – I mean, I
travel, you know, such a lot and I have a

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:12.130
family, and everything is there; but is just
happening, I am just seeing it, I am not doing

00:32:12.130 --> 00:32:19.130
anything as such. So when you are also awakened,
there’s no obligation, it’s just happening.

00:32:20.390 --> 00:32:27.390
It is here where we should understand that
this center is bestowed upon by the great

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:37.770
life of Christ. Christ is there, and they
said that He died for our sins, died for our

00:32:37.770 --> 00:32:44.770
karmas – is a fact. Because when He is awakened
these two institutions are pulled in inside,

00:32:46.290 --> 00:32:53.290
and you get your kundalini out there – it
opens out. And this bone which had been calcified

00:32:53.809 --> 00:33:00.730
opens out, and the kundalini pierces through.
And this is what it is, that He died for our

00:33:00.730 --> 00:33:07.730
sins, but still the theory is extended that
we must suffer. Why should we suffer? He has

00:33:09.230 --> 00:33:15.240
suffered for us already. And is already written
by Thomas, who was travelling to India via

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:21.500
Egypt where he wrote the treatise, and he
said that “Why should we suffer? Christ

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:26.120
has already suffered for us.” And he’s
talked everything about Sahaja Yoga; he said

00:33:26.120 --> 00:33:32.770
it is an experience of Self-realization, and
everything. And that book now is out in England.

00:33:32.770 --> 00:33:38.790
After forty-eight years they could decode
the whole thing, which was found about forty-eight

00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:44.450
years back in Egypt and is out now, and is
beautiful – “Gnostics” is the name of

00:33:44.450 --> 00:33:51.450
the book. But is not so much appreciated by
some of the people, because this challenges

00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:59.360
the theories of sufferings and confessions
and all this nonsense.

00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:13.970
[Inaudible question]

00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:20.970
Me, or you? You cannot awaken yourself. You
see, you have to have one enlightened candle

00:34:28.389 --> 00:34:35.389
to enlighten another candle. This candle which
is not enlightened cannot enlighten itself.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:44.480
But there’s no obligation. But you can correct:
once it is awakened you can correct it, you

00:34:45.419 --> 00:34:52.419
can develop it. First only few hair-like strands
of this energy come up and open the fontanel

00:34:55.389 --> 00:35:02.389
bone area, and then this flow of ruh starts
flowing on you and it relaxes more of the

00:35:06.850 --> 00:35:13.850
centers, so more of these strands start coming
up. So you can develop it at your will, by

00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:22.440
understanding it, but you cannot enlighten
yourself by yourself.

00:35:22.650 --> 00:35:29.650
[Inaudible question about the difficulty of
maintaining total awareness in meditation.]

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:54.550
Because it’s not Sahaja meditation. All
other meditations are artificial. You are

00:35:54.550 --> 00:36:00.750
in meditation when you are in Sahaj. Unless
and until kundalini is awakened and you are

00:36:00.750 --> 00:36:05.090
one with the divine Power, you’re still
thinking all the time – how can you stop

00:36:05.090 --> 00:36:11.730
thinking? There is one thought that rises
and another thought that falls off, again

00:36:11.730 --> 00:36:16.070
the another thought comes up and it falls
off: it goes on like this, and we are dancing

00:36:16.070 --> 00:36:20.850
on the cusps of these thoughts. In between
the thought there’s a little space called

00:36:20.850 --> 00:36:27.850
as “vilamba”, is the present – either
we are in the past or in the future – but

00:36:27.869 --> 00:36:34.869
that is only possible when the kundalini comes
up. Then these thoughts become more lean and

00:36:36.750 --> 00:36:42.980
there’s a bigger space left, and you remain
in thoughtless awareness, and that is how

00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.050
it works out.

00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:52.050
That’s in the meditative mood you are all
the time, you don’t have to meditate because

00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:59.500
you’re in thoughtless awareness. As soon
as you see something extremely beautiful,

00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:06.780
extremely joy-giving, or a personality who
is a realized soul, or anything that’s so

00:37:07.950 --> 00:37:13.690
righteous and good, immediately you become
thoughtless, immediately. It happens – you

00:37:13.690 --> 00:37:19.450
don’t have to do it, you don’t have to
be in meditation, you just become.

00:37:19.450 --> 00:37:26.020
I have seen these days there are many children
who are born who are realized souls, and just

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:33.020
I’ve seen them sitting before Me, just – just
sitting, not moving, nothing, just in meditation.

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000
Your pupils dilate, and you start feeling
the cool breeze in your hand. Even if you

00:37:42.380 --> 00:37:49.380
meet someone it happens, if he’s a realized
soul. It’s very interesting, there was a

00:37:50.650 --> 00:37:57.650
poet in India who was himself a tailor and
he went to see somebody who was a potter – they

00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:07.510
both were realized souls. And the potter was
busy with his clay, you see, trampling it

00:38:08.150 --> 00:38:15.150
with his feet. When he saw, this tailor saw
this potter, he looked at him, went into thoughtless

00:38:17.660 --> 00:38:22.330
awareness, and he said that – the poetry
is so beautiful – he says, “I came to

00:38:22.330 --> 00:38:29.330
see the nirguna” – meaning the formless,
that is the vibrations – “I came to see

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:36.280
that, but that is in person here.” Such
appreciation is not possible unless and until

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:42.020
you are a realized soul – you always see
the defects of a person. But such a deep appreciation

00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:46.480
of another personality is only possible when
you are a realized soul, and then you are

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:50.560
amazed how you are surrounded by such beautiful
people.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:57.560
We had this time at least three thousand people
for a seminar in India: no quarrels, no fights,

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:04.820
all the time I hear about bouts of laughter,
joking, leg-pulling, all nice friendship going

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:11.820
on; no problems of any kind, satisfied with
everything – so beautiful to see. Like I

00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:17.820
went to Russia, and the Germans came to give
realization to Russians, you know – that

00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:24.030
was too much. It was too much: I mean, I just
felt so happy about it, so happy, the tears

00:39:24.030 --> 00:39:31.030
started rolling in My eyes when I saw the
Germans just embracing all of them with such

00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:38.280
joy and purity, it was wonderful. In Sahaja
Yoga Germans have become so gentle. The most

00:39:39.859 --> 00:39:46.859
gentle people are the Germans, extremely gentle
– can you believe that?

00:39:53.750 --> 00:40:00.750
(It’s a big question.)

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:18.450
[Question about how long it takes to transform.]

00:40:46.849 --> 00:40:52.840
Depends on. It has transformed so many people
instantly, so many. Majority of people get

00:40:52.840 --> 00:40:59.340
transformed immediately. Some people do take
time, I must say, but transformation, the

00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:05.510
degree of transformation may vary from time
to time. For example, in a place like London

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:12.420
where there are all hard nuts, I must tell
you! – they’re very nice people, you see,

00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:18.910
very scholarly, and coming from Cambridge
and from Oxford and this and that – very

00:41:18.910 --> 00:41:25.840
skeptical, doesn’t matter. These people
had taken to drugs: imagine, very well-educated,

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:32.840
some professors, some doctors had taken to
drugs and were alcoholics; absolutely they

00:41:33.570 --> 00:41:40.570
were lost people, I would say. And when they
got their realization, overnight they gave

00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:49.800
up – drinking, alcoholism. I was amazed
at their own depths. The way they trust their

00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:56.800
own depth, they just gave up – it’s very
surprising.

00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:05.349
So you cannot say the degree, but one should
never have diffidence about it. It all works

00:42:05.349 --> 00:42:11.730
out, the transformation works out, and in
collectivity it works out much better. If

00:42:11.730 --> 00:42:16.470
you get out of the collectivity it is like
a nail which is cut out of the hand, you see,

00:42:16.470 --> 00:42:22.590
because you are all part and parcel of the
whole, of one being, and you are awakened;

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:28.450
but if you get out of that body, then again
there’s a problem.

00:42:28.450 --> 00:42:34.599
So it takes time for such people. And also
for people who are sick, maybe more time,

00:42:34.599 --> 00:42:40.740
maybe some people who are mentally worse.
Some people are, as I said, hard nuts can

00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:47.630
break very fast. You can say I have had all
kinds of experiences. And I always say that

00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:54.630
Sahaja Yoga is a big joke, I tell you, because
you see people, just you see them so aggressive,

00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:59.220
so funny. Like one fellow came all drunk to
the program, and he was so aggressive with

00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:04.830
Me and he was about to hit Me. Then they took
him out. I said, “All right, come and see

00:43:04.830 --> 00:43:09.760
Me tomorrow.” Then they put the address
in his pocket. Next day he was there, and

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.369
today he’s a very good engineer, electrical
engineer he is; he’s very good.

00:43:11.369 --> 00:43:18.369
[Question: Can You explain the process You
use to raise the kundalini?]

00:43:26.090 --> 00:43:33.090
All right, that I’m going to do. That’s
a very good question. Yes, that I will do.

00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:52.180
[Question: Could You give some advice on how
to be non-judgmental – not to judge others?]

00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:14.220
Yes, people start judging others because they
don’t know themselves. Once you know yourself,

00:44:19.010 --> 00:44:23.430
start judging yourself first of all. This
is the Last Judgment, where you judge yourself.

00:44:23.430 --> 00:44:30.430
Is written in Koran that “your hands will
speak, and they will give witness against

00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:35.320
you.” And you get frightened about yourself,
“Oh God, I’ve got this, and …” Like

00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:38.700
the other day somebody came, “Mother, please,
please solve my problem.”

00:44:38.700 --> 00:44:39.690
I said, “What has happened?”

00:44:39.690 --> 00:44:44.920
“My Agnya is horrible” – means “I
am very egoistical.” So the attention goes

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:51.920
to yourself and you start correcting yourself,
and you look at the good points of others.

00:44:56.200 --> 00:45:02.320
And if somebody says to you that such a chakra
is catching, you thank that person, you’re

00:45:02.320 --> 00:45:08.710
happy, because his interest is benevolence.
He is not trying to judge you, but is benevolence

00:45:08.710 --> 00:45:13.619
if he finds it. But normally you find yourself
about yourself, there’s no need to talk

00:45:13.619 --> 00:45:15.590
about it; just find out yourself.

00:45:15.590 --> 00:45:22.590
[Question: Mother, is it possible that once
you become realized, you can fall back?]

00:45:25.440 --> 00:45:32.440
Yes, it is, sometimes, you know. Because at
the time of the growth, is the parable of

00:45:33.290 --> 00:45:37.230
Christ, you see, that He said that some seeds
fell on the marshy ground – they sprouted,

00:45:37.230 --> 00:45:44.230
but did not grow. So that, it’s possible
because depends on the superficial temperament

00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:50.080
of a person, may be possible. But so far I
have seen many people who went out of the

00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:57.080
Sahaja Yoga again are back – again back,
very much. The other day we saw them in Melbourne:

00:45:57.250 --> 00:46:01.530
so many are back again, and they were very
sorry that they went out, they want to come

00:46:01.530 --> 00:46:08.530
back – because so much of enjoyment, you
see. When you have tasted the nectar, the

00:46:09.070 --> 00:46:14.330
ambrose, then you don’t want to taste something
else. But if you try again because of your

00:46:14.330 --> 00:46:18.500
habits or something, again you want to come
back, because you remember that experience.

00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:25.500
The Sahaja Yoga moves like that. Many people
come in first. Then a few people come for

00:46:27.090 --> 00:46:34.090
follow-on. Then again some people come in,
and some more come in – like that it goes

00:46:34.490 --> 00:46:40.340
on filling the cup. But follow-on people will
be less: depends on the depth of a person

00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:45.359
how much he has touched it, or how much he
has understood his own value of his realization.

00:46:45.359 --> 00:46:51.670
They’ll all come, but some people won’t;
but then they start coming back. And how it

00:46:51.670 --> 00:46:55.420
grows that way. Now I don’t know – if
you ask Me, I don’t know how many there

00:46:55.420 --> 00:47:00.740
are in this whole world, Sahaja yogis. I can
only make them out whenever I see them, they

00:47:00.740 --> 00:47:07.740
are Sahaja yogis, that’s all. You also have
one method: we take the photograph of a person

00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:15.900
after realization and put the name and the
time of realization, the date of birth, and

00:47:17.990 --> 00:47:24.990
put it on these plastic albums and I see them,
all of them, and that’s how I know.

00:47:26.619 --> 00:47:33.619
It’s a beautiful rapport, and love and friendship,
understanding and protection. No one wants

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:39.310
to leave it normally; but if they want, they’re
free – there’s no force. You cannot force

00:47:39.310 --> 00:47:44.930
it, that’s the main point. Even if you don’t
want Sahaja Yoga I cannot force it, if you

00:47:44.930 --> 00:47:49.460
don’t want pure knowledge I cannot force
it, if you don’t want Self-realization,

00:47:49.460 --> 00:47:56.460
I cannot force it. It cannot be forced. It’s
not conversion, it is transformation.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:12.490
Now should we have? All right. Again I repeat
that it cannot be forced. So those who do

00:48:23.220 --> 00:48:30.220
not want to have it, have to leave the hall
please, that would be very kind of them. It

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:37.980
takes only ten minutes. There’s no danger,
nothing of the kind; and most of you will

00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:42.480
feel it, I’m sure, the all-pervading Power.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:48.210
Now first thing you feel is the cool breeze
out of your fontanel bone area, and then also

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:54.260
you feel the cool breeze on your fingertips.
Sometimes you might feel heat, if you have

00:48:54.260 --> 00:49:00.170
a liver problem or something, or if you have
not forgiven people. But there are two conditions

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:07.150
for Sahaja Yoga. One of them is that you have
to forget the past – you have to forgive

00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:14.150
yourself completely, and not to feel guilty
at all. No guilt, because with the guilt you

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:21.060
catch on this center and which is very dangerous
also – I’ll tell about it later when we

00:49:21.060 --> 00:49:27.420
go on with it – but please do not feel guilty.
At this moment in the present you are all

00:49:27.420 --> 00:49:34.420
great people who are here to get your realization,
you are seekers of truth, and forget about

00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:42.440
anything that makes you feel guilty. That’s
one condition. That means you should be pleasantly

00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:50.950
placed towards yourself – as we say in Sanskrit,
“prasannajit” – because you are going

00:49:50.950 --> 00:49:57.410
to enter into the Kingdom of God, and you
should be very happy to do that.

00:49:57.410 --> 00:50:04.010
Now, the second condition is that you have
to forgive everyone. Some people say it’s

00:50:04.010 --> 00:50:09.900
very difficult to forgive, but if you forgive
or don’t forgive, it’s a myth. What do

00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:15.080
you do? Nothing. But if you don’t forgive,
then you play into wrong hands. So at this

00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:20.730
moment just say, just in general; not to remember
all of them who have troubled you, or who

00:50:20.730 --> 00:50:26.580
have made you miserable or made you unhappy.
Just say “I forgive every one of them”

00:50:26.580 --> 00:50:31.050
– that’s all. These two conditions you
have to follow, which is very simple: it’s

00:50:31.050 --> 00:50:38.050
just to say in your heart that “I am not
guilty at all” and that “I forgive everyone.”

00:50:39.150 --> 00:50:40.820
So now we work it out.

00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:47.820
Now, we may have take out our shoes, because
the shoes are not an obstruction but better

00:50:51.570 --> 00:50:58.570
to take some help from the Mother Earth, it
is important. And trust yourself, believe

00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:11.210
in yourself, have self-confidence. Don’t
think that you can’t get it – all of you

00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:17.560
can get it, you’re quite capable.

00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:24.560
Now, I’ll show you first how to nourish
your own centers and to raise your kundalini.

00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:37.500
First, you keep your eyes open and see for
yourself, and later on we have to close our

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:42.859
eyes to go into the process – it’s very
simple. So first of all, the left hand is

00:51:42.859 --> 00:51:49.330
towards Me, representing the desire to get
Self-realization, just like this: ordinary

00:51:49.330 --> 00:51:56.330
way of sitting, not too much of bending or
too much of straight. Just ordinary way we

00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:03.420
sit, comfortably, and put both the feet apart
from each other because these are two powers.

00:52:03.420 --> 00:52:09.780
So just to keep them on the ground apart from
each other, and the left hand towards Me.

00:52:09.780 --> 00:52:16.099
Now the right hand is the one which does the
action to nourish your centers. So first we

00:52:16.099 --> 00:52:22.440
put our right hand on our heart, while we
keep the left hand all the time steady like

00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:29.440
that. Now, in the heart resides the spirit.
In the heart resides the spirit, and the first

00:52:32.609 --> 00:52:39.609
thing is to recognize that it resides in our
heart. We have to open our heart for that.

00:52:41.430 --> 00:52:48.430
Then we take down our hand to the upper portion
of our abdomen, which is the center of your

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:54.650
mastery. So many great masters, as we call
them Satgurus, have created this special center

00:52:54.650 --> 00:53:01.460
for us. By enlightening it, you become the
master and you can give realizations to others.

00:53:01.460 --> 00:53:07.650
Because if you are the spirit, the light of
spirit guides you, so you become your own

00:53:07.650 --> 00:53:10.880
guru, you become your own master.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:17.730
Then is the center which is in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side. We

00:53:17.730 --> 00:53:24.140
work only on the left-hand side. This is the
very important center which manifests on your

00:53:24.140 --> 00:53:31.140
central nervous system the pure knowledge,
by which you can feel the all-pervading Power

00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:42.960
and you can know all the laws that are divine.
Then you take back your hand on the upper

00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:51.450
portion of your abdomen again, on the left-hand
side, and press it hard. And then you take

00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:59.160
your right hand again on your heart. Then,
in the corner of your shoulder and your neck,

00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:09.260
like this, from this side, and turn your head
to your right fully so that you can push back

00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:15.359
your …. Now this is the center mostly catching,
is the center where we feel guilty. It’s

00:54:15.359 --> 00:54:22.359
a very dangerous one because when it catches
you get spondylitis, you get so many other

00:54:22.589 --> 00:54:28.680
troubles like angina, and the whole system
becomes very lethargic. So please put this

00:54:28.680 --> 00:54:35.680
right hand across and press it hard onto the
spinal cord on the left-hand side.

00:54:40.980 --> 00:54:47.980
Now, take your right hand on your forehead
across like this and put down your head. Put

00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:58.500
down your head and press it on both the sides,
your forehead, as we do it when we have headaches,

00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:05.900
just like this. This is the center for forgiving
others. Now you take back your right hand

00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:14.480
on the back side of your head, and push back
your head slowly on it as far as you can take

00:55:15.510 --> 00:55:22.510
it, balancing on the hand like that. Now here
you have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine,

00:55:26.099 --> 00:55:33.099
if knowingly or unknowingly you have done
some mistakes – but without feeling guilty,

00:55:34.349 --> 00:55:40.260
without counting the mistakes, without thinking
about them – for your satisfaction only.

00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:47.180
Now you have to stretch your hand, right hand
fully, stretch your palm. And the center of

00:55:47.180 --> 00:55:54.180
your palm, you have to put it on top of your
fontanel bone area here and press back your

00:55:55.570 --> 00:56:02.570
fingers. Press them back, stretch them back,
so that there’s a nice pressure on your

00:56:04.700 --> 00:56:11.700
fontanel bone area. And here you have to move
your scalp very slowly clockwise, seven times

00:56:12.529 --> 00:56:17.310
– the scalp, not the hand, the scalp has
to move. This is very important. So stretch

00:56:17.310 --> 00:56:24.310
back your fingers, stretch them back so the
pressure is all right. And now .…

00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:39.480
Hmm, that’s all we have to do, not much.
Now we can close our eyes, both the feet apart

00:56:53.089 --> 00:56:59.730
from each other, left hand like this, and
the right hand is to be used for nourishing

00:56:59.730 --> 00:57:04.839
our centers on the left-hand side. Please
close your eyes and don’t open them till

00:57:04.839 --> 00:57:09.510
I tell you. You can take out your spectacles
also: there’s no need to have spectacles

00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:16.510
when you have closed your eyes, and also sometimes
it helps your eyesight.

00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:26.160
So now, please close your eyes. Put your right
hand on your heart, left hand towards Me.

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:38.690
Here you have to ask a very important question,
three times to Me, in your heart. As you ask

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:45.750
a computer, you have to ask a question – you
can call Me “Shri Mataji” or you can call

00:57:45.750 --> 00:57:52.130
Me “Mother” – “Mother, am I the spirit?
Mother, am I the spirit?” Ask this question

00:57:52.130 --> 00:57:59.130
three times. Please keep your eyes shut.

00:58:04.710 --> 00:58:11.710
Now, if you are the spirit, you are your guide,
you are your guru. So now please take down

00:58:20.599 --> 00:58:27.570
this right hand on the upper portion of your
abdomen on the left-hand side, and here you

00:58:27.570 --> 00:58:34.570
ask Me another question in your heart, with
full confidence, “Mother, am I my own master?

00:58:38.050 --> 00:58:45.050
Mother, am I my own master?” Ask this question
three times.

00:58:53.260 --> 00:59:00.260
Now, take down your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen. Here is the center

00:59:11.109 --> 00:59:18.109
of pure knowledge. And as I told you, it cannot
be forced on you – I respect your freedom.

00:59:23.270 --> 00:59:30.270
So here you have to say six times in your
heart, because this center has got six petals.

00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:37.770
You have to say, “Mother, please give me
pure knowledge” – I cannot force it on

00:59:39.980 --> 00:59:46.980
you. Six times. As soon as you start saying
this, the kundalini starts rising. And now

00:59:57.510 --> 01:00:04.510
we have to nourish our centers, upper centers,
with our self-confidence. So now raise your

01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:17.990
right hand onto the upper portion of your
abdomen on the left-hand side, and here you

01:00:27.010 --> 01:00:34.010
have to say with full confidence in yourself,
to open this center, “Mother, I am my own

01:00:37.930 --> 01:00:44.270
master.” Say it ten times, please. “Mother,
I am my own master.” Say it with full confidence.

01:00:44.270 --> 01:00:51.270
Now, the greatest truth about you is that
you are not this body, you are not this mind,

01:01:03.910 --> 01:01:10.910
you are not these emotions, nor you are this
ego or these thoughts; but you are pure spirit.

01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:18.500
This is the greatest truth. So now raise your
right hand to your heart and say with full

01:01:24.190 --> 01:01:31.190
confidence, with full confidence you have
to say, “Mother, I am the spirit.” Say

01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:44.010
it twelve times, please. “Mother, I am the
spirit.” Twelve times, with full confidence.

01:01:53.290 --> 01:02:00.290
Now, I have already told you that you need
not have guilt. The all-pervading Power is

01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:23.480
the ocean of love and bliss, it is the ocean
of knowledge and joy, but above all it is

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:32.660
the ocean of forgiveness. So you cannot commit
any mistakes that cannot be dissolved by the

01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:39.660
power of this great ocean of forgiveness.
So now raise your right hand in the corner

01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:46.660
of your neck and your shoulder and place it
behind as much as possible, from the front

01:02:46.660 --> 01:02:52.819
side – not from the back side, but from
the front side – and turn your head towards

01:02:52.819 --> 01:02:59.819
the right. Here you have to say, again with
full confidence, sixteen times because there

01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:11.470
are sixteen petals to this, “Mother, I am
not guilty at all.”

01:03:29.150 --> 01:03:35.829
As I have told you that we have to forgive
everyone, and many people think that it’s

01:03:35.829 --> 01:03:41.980
difficult to forgive. Whether you forgive
or you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything;

01:03:41.980 --> 01:03:48.380
but we are not to play into wrong hands by
not forgiving, which is a myth, absolute myth.

01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:55.380
So now raise your right hand and put it on
your forehead across, bend your head fully

01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:03.560
and press it hard. And here from your heart,
say “Mother, I forgive everyone.” You

01:04:05.260 --> 01:04:08.390
don’t have to think how many people you
have to forgive, whom you have to forgive,

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:14.270
for what you have to forgive, but just say,
“Mother, I forgive everyone.” From your

01:04:14.270 --> 01:04:21.270
heart, not how many times; it has to come
from your heart. This is very important. If

01:04:23.369 --> 01:04:27.740
you don’t forgive, the kundalini won’t
just pass through: this is the very important

01:04:27.740 --> 01:04:34.740
center of Agnya, which is a very constricted
one normally. So please say it from your heart,

01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:43.530
“Mother, I forgive everyone.” Don’t
say “I can’t” – please don’t say

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:51.420
that.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:58.420
Now take your hand on the back side of your
head, and push back your head on it as far

01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:08.800
as you could take it, and let it rest on your
hand. Here you have to ask for forgiveness

01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:18.200
from Divine. But you are not to think of the
mistakes you have committed or whatever wrongs

01:05:18.349 --> 01:05:23.900
you have done, or to count them or to think
of the people, but just in general for your

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:30.900
own satisfaction you have to say, without
feeling guilty – from your heart, not how

01:05:31.510 --> 01:05:38.510
many times – “Oh Divine, please forgive
me if I have done, knowingly or unknowingly,

01:05:40.609 --> 01:05:46.440
anything wrong.”

01:05:46.440 --> 01:05:53.440
Now, stretch your hand, stretch your palm.
Now put your hand or your palm, the center

01:06:08.410 --> 01:06:15.410
of your palm, on top of the fontanel bone
area and now stretch your fingers backwards

01:06:16.630 --> 01:06:22.970
– this is very important. Stretch them as
much as you can, so that there’s a nice

01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:29.970
pressure on your fontanel bone area. And you
have to move it, the scalp, seven times clockwise

01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:39.440
very, very slowly. But here again I cannot
cross over your freedom – you have to ask

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:48.339
for Self-realization. So please say seven
times, “Mother, please give me Self-realization.”

01:06:48.339 --> 01:06:55.339
Please ask for it seven times, when you are
moving your hand slowly seven times.

01:07:03.130 --> 01:07:10.130
[Shri Mataji blows into microphone.]

01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:48.410
Now please take down your hands, and open
your eyes. You can put on your glasses if

01:07:48.410 --> 01:07:55.410
you want to. Now put your right hand towards
Me now like this, a little lifted up, and

01:07:57.720 --> 01:08:04.720
bend your head. And see for yourself, with
the left hand on top of the fontanel bone,

01:08:07.220 --> 01:08:12.420
see for yourself – bending your head – see
for yourself if there’s a cool breeze coming

01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:18.929
out of your fontanel bone area. You can lift
the hand a little higher, sometimes it can

01:08:18.929 --> 01:08:25.929
be much higher, but don’t touch your head.
Should be above, at least three to four inches

01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:33.939
minimum to begin with, and then you’ll feel
the cool breeze. Just move your hand – bend

01:08:33.939 --> 01:08:37.069
your head is the best way.

01:08:37.069 --> 01:08:44.069
Now put the left hand towards Me like this,
and now bend your head and see with your right

01:08:44.969 --> 01:08:51.969
hand if there’s a cool breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area. There could be

01:08:52.159 --> 01:08:59.159
hot air also coming, doesn’t matter. Don’t
doubt it, and don’t think it’s air conditioning

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:07.769
after all! It cannot be coming out of your
head, isn’t it? Now again put the right

01:09:09.159 --> 01:09:16.159
hand towards Me, keep your head bent, and
also now see for yourself if you can feel

01:09:16.949 --> 01:09:23.949
the cool breeze coming out of your head with
the left hand.

01:09:27.469 --> 01:09:34.469
Now, you can lift your both the hands towards
the roof like this, and bend back your head.

01:09:40.979 --> 01:09:47.109
And here you have to ask a question three
times, “Mother, is this the cool breeze

01:09:47.109 --> 01:09:54.109
of the Holy Ghost? Mother, is this the ruh?
Mother, is this the Paramachaitanya? Mother,

01:09:55.900 --> 01:10:02.900
is this the all-pervading Power of God’s
love?” Ask any one of these questions, three

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:13.530
times. Now put down your hands, and just watch
Me without thinking – you can do it.

01:10:21.939 --> 01:10:28.939
Now, those who have felt the cool breeze out
of their fontanel bone or on their fingertips

01:10:31.179 --> 01:10:38.179
– even hot air is all right – please raise
both your hands. Oh, most of you – yes!

01:10:43.420 --> 01:10:50.420
May God bless you. You’re all saints now,
I bow to all of you. May God bless you. So

01:10:51.429 --> 01:10:56.079
nice to see – some of you did not feel it,
doesn’t matter; don’t get disappointed.

01:10:56.079 --> 01:11:01.530
We have a very nice center, and some of you
who have not felt can come round, and some

01:11:01.530 --> 01:11:06.409
of the Sahaja yogis can work it out for you;
maybe there’s some sort of an obstruction

01:11:06.409 --> 01:11:12.729
somewhere. So don’t feel nervous about it:
it will all work out, no problem.

01:11:12.729 --> 01:11:15.539
So may God bless you.

01:11:15.539 --> 01:11:16.309
If you want you can come and shake hands with
Me, because I’ll be going away tomorrow.

01:11:16.309 --> 01:11:16.559
I could move forward a little bit.

01:11:16.309 --> 01:11:16.989
Why not turn the lights to them now? …. All
the lights are always like this? …. Come

01:11:16.989 --> 01:11:17.610
along, come along. I’d love to meet you.
So, we’re going to work it out now.

01:11:17.610 --> 01:11:18.260
But you did feel it? Hot, you did, all right?
That’s all right, now you’d better forgive.

01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:19.119
That’s very important. Better forgive. You
can help your friend in the hospital also.

01:11:19.119 --> 01:11:20.829
Now better? You see, because, because you
have not forgiven. Now better? Forgive, forgive,

01:11:20.829 --> 01:11:22.880
forgive. You must forgive, it’s very important
to forgive. … Just forgive, forgive, forgive,

01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:24.929
forgive. All right? Still hot? You didn’t
forgive. Forgive, again. Just say, “Mother,

01:11:24.929 --> 01:11:27.289
I forgive everyone” – just forgive. What
a weapon it is, just to forgive; it’s such

01:11:27.289 --> 01:11:29.829
a weapon, such a protection …. Still hot?
Better? Work it out, all right? You can come

01:11:29.829 --> 01:11:36.829
and see these people .…
