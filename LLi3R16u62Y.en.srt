1
00:00:07,579 --> 00:00:13,920
So now the other center which we have here is very
important center, called as the Vishuddhi Chakra.

2
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:16,790
This is the center Vi-shuddha.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,231
One is “shuddha”, means “pure”, but
“vishuddha” means “absolutely pure”.

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,360
This has got sixteen petals, as
we have got the cervical plexus

5
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:33,660
expressed in the gross, which has
also got sixteen sub-plexuses.

6
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,081
It tallies with medical science completely.

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,544
Now, this Vishuddhi Chakra is bestowed
upon by the deity of Shri Krishna.

8
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:52,207
Shri Krishna is the one which is the evolution of
the Vishnu Tattwa [Vishnu Principle] from there

9
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,740
upward to the state of Primordial Being.

10
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:06,180
He is the one who resides as the Primordial
Being, as the Whole, as the Akbar.

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,980
When Mohammed Sahib talked of
Akbar, he talked of Shri Krishna.

12
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:17,460
This is the finger which represents
this center, and He said: “Put these

13
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:26,040
into your ears and say ‘Allah hu Akbar’
— you get in connection with the Virat."

14
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,016
Now, what Sahaja Yoga does is to
make you in contact with the whole.

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,010
It makes you in contact with the whole.

16
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:40,000
It’s not that it limits you, but
it makes you one with the whole.

17
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:46,620
So one must understand that what you have to
achieve in your realization is just not talk

18
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,735
of Shri Krishna, just thinking, singing about
— which is absurd. People don’t understand.

19
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:58,740
That in Oxford Street we find people with all
these nonsensical things going on; begging,

20
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:07,378
asking for alms… I feel it’s such an insult to
Shri Krishna that people in His name are begging.

21
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:13,200
But it’s done in all religious movements
that people beg in the name of God.

22
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,180
There is no need to beg.

23
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,360
First you equip yourself with the blessings of
God that there is no need for you to beg at all.

24
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:27,900
And begging is against God’s
realization, against Self-realization.

25
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:30,092
You must have self-esteem.

26
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:32,040
That’s one thing very important.

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,877
If you do not have self-esteem,
you cannot get realization.

28
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,640
Why should you go on the streets and beg?

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,580
It’s absolutely absurd, it’s a showing-off
thing, which is of no use to yourself.

30
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:50,191
By doing this, you are really
corrupting the name of Shri Krishna.

31
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:58,320
But if you take to the right path, if this
center is awakened, your hands become connected

32
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,213
with the Primordial Being, and you become,
your hands become collectively conscious.

33
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:07,920
Medically, they accept that the extremities have

34
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,620
got something to do with the
sympathetic nervous system.

35
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:12,999
That far, no more than that.

36
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:18,300
But in Sahaja Yoga, you’ll be amazed that
the vibration starts flowing through your

37
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:21,126
hand when you take the name of Shri Krishna.

38
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,560
And these vibrations, when you
want to find out what are these,

39
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,503
then you’ll be amazed they relate
to your centers within yourself.

40
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:34,440
Even if you get ten children who are
realized souls, and tie their eyes,

41
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:38,160
and ask them about a person who is
sitting before them what’s wrong with him,

42
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,600
they will say one finger, or this
finger, or this finger, or two fingers.

43
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,060
Because you can feel the charring, you
can feel sometimes a kind of a heat.

44
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,459
Sometimes you may feel the numbness.

45
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,654
If you feel the numbness on your fingers,
then you must know that the person has to die.

46
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,114
So many things you can know, all the permutations

47
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:10,140
of these seven centers and this
one: one, five, and … six and seven.

48
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,564
So we have seven centers.

49
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:18,540
To understand about the centers, first you
must get your realization, that is important.

50
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,025
In the beginning you’ll find the vibrations
are coming, going, coming, going.

51
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,300
It is not steady.

52
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,160
First you must steady yourself.

53
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,831
Then you can find out, from your
hands, what are the centers catching.

54
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:36,831
Because these vibrations are nothing but
the Power of God is flowing through you.

55
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:41,940
They understand, these
vibrations, they co-ordinate.

56
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,260
They are life’s force.

57
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,100
They are the one who create all these
living things like … they are the one

58
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:57,612
who sprout a seed, they are the one
who transform the flower into a fruit.

59
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:05,912
All living work is done by these vibrations,
which is called as Chaitanya, Aum, Ruh,

60
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,440
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,
and all-pervading Power of God.

61
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,140
That starts flowing through
you, first time you feel them.

62
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,280
Yesterday, many people felt it, and people
were very happy that so many felt it,

63
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:25,458
because that’s a sign that here many
people are going to get Realization.

64
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:31,479
You don’t have to go to anybody, you have
to just practice a little bit and find out.

65
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,014
You’ll become such an expert.

66
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:42,662
One person in India who got realization has so far
given realization to at least ten thousand people.

67
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,329
In a village.

68
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,005
Many villages.

69
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,520
He’s a very ordinary man.

70
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,154
We wanted him to come, but there was a kind
of a visa problem, so he could not come.

71
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,480
He’s a very simple farmer,
and he got his Realization,

72
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,480
and he knows so much about Sahaja Yoga
that you’ll be amazed; he has not been

73
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:04,860
to any university, to any college or
anything, but he’s so knowledgeable.

74
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:08,650
Because once you have these
vibrations they guide you.

75
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:17,828
So the Spirit sitting in your heart guides you
and tells you what is right and what is wrong.

76
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:24,300
If you have to ask a question: “Mother,
is there God?” — if you ask this question,

77
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:29,385
immediately there will be a tremendous
flow saying that it is there.

78
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,680
Now, how to understand that these are the
vibrations of God, also this question can come.

79
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,107
We can judge them relatively.

80
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,980
For example, in one of the programs in Pune,

81
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,220
people invited Me to speak in a place which
was owned by brahmins, and they opposed it.

82
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:50,700
They said, “She’s not a brahmin,
so we will not have her here."

83
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:54,360
So they said, “All right, we’ll publish in the
newspaper — because Her name has gone in the

84
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,890
newspaper — we’ll tell them that these people are
so ‘brahminic’ that they don’t want to have Her."

85
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,340
Of course, they didn’t want to have that bad
name, so they said, “All right, let’s have her."

86
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,580
These people never told Me what had happened.

87
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,420
Suddenly I said, “Those who think
who are brahmins, come down."

88
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,420
So four-five of them came and sat before Me.

89
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,760
These are brahmins without knowing the Brahma.
So I said, “All right, put your hands before Me."

90
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,460
And they just started shaking
like this, going back.

91
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,180
I said, “What’s happening to you?” So
they said, “Mother, you are Shakti (Power),

92
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,200
that’s why it is happening to me, to
us,” but I said, “What about others?

93
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,400
It’s not happening to others."

94
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,480
So they turned round and said, “Look at
these, they are also doing like this."

95
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,280
I said, “Ask them from where do they come."

96
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,913
They went and asked them; they said, “We are
coming from the lunatic asylum of Thane."

97
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,780
So these fanatics, who believed
that they were brahmins,

98
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:47,017
were reacting the same way as these lunatics.

99
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,660
And they believed that they were brahmins,
they were not supposed to touch anybody,

100
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:56,340
they were “untouchables” people, and they
were … the one who gave them realization

101
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:01,712
was from so-called untouchable, a shoemaker.

102
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:06,300
Now he’s become their guru, of all these
brahmins, and he’s teaching them about God.

103
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:13,371
So this center gives you the
power to be one with the whole.

104
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:20,100
It has many powers, but the main power it
gives you is the power to be one with the

105
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:28,308
whole and to have all the powers of that
deity within you awakened, so that you can

106
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,041
become aware and make others also aware of it.

107
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,020
Those people who talk too much catch on

108
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,220
the right Vishuddhi, those who do
not talk at all catch on the left.

109
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:43,620
Those who feel guilty catch on the left,

110
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:47,340
those who think they are all right and
aggressive, they catch on the right.

111
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,240
It’s like that.

112
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,380
So this has to be understood in right
perspective: that if you misuse this center,

113
00:08:55,380 --> 00:09:00,720
what happens to you, so how you should
give yourself a balance to improve that.

114
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:07,093
But the best part of Sahaja Yoga is
this: that when you get them realization,

115
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,060
they are separated from themselves.

116
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:12,300
They’ll come and tell Me, “Mother,
my Agnya Chakra is catching."

117
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,660
So, if you ask them, “Really?”
— “Yes, Mother, very much."

118
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:20,000
That means they are suffering from too much ego.

119
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,760
But can you imagine anybody saying,
“Mother, I’m suffering from too much ego”?

120
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,300
Because you are separated from
yourself, you see your ego,

121
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,611
the big balloonic-like thing, and you
say, “Mother, please remove my ego."

122
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,600
That is how people talk to Me.

123
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,920
They will tell Me: “Mother, I talk too much,
that’s why my right Vishuddhi is catching.

124
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,680
You better cure it, I must
stop my talking too much."

125
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:44,880
So you start correcting yourself
because you get separated from yourself,

126
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,180
you become the Spirit; and the rest you see.

127
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,880
Like I see My sari: if there’s a spot,

128
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,760
I would like to clean it, I’m
not identified with the spot.

129
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,660
So, that’s how it happens; you are
no more identified with yourself,

130
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,740
and you start seeing the faults
in you, and you try to correct it.

131
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:05,160
That’s how you become a beautiful
person — by your own attention,

132
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:10,079
not by anybody else, it is you who has to do it.
