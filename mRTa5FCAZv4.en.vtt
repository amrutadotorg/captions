WEBVTT

00:42.165 --> 00:45.584
Out of tune they are going.

00:45.609 --> 00:50.131
They are going out of tune a little bit.
Let them go in tune, you see?

00:50.156 --> 00:55.598
One should not go in…speak with heart,
and speak with feelings,

00:55.623 --> 01:03.559
and should not be out of tune.
They are out of tune, very much.

01:04.037 --> 01:07.244
Do it properly. Now.

01:28.812 --> 01:32.218
Come along. Let’s have it again.

01:38.929 --> 01:42.086
Must say in tune, in proper tune,
you see?

01:42.111 --> 01:46.976
Just without tune if you go out…
you play and then they should sing.

01:54.491 --> 01:58.850
Where are they? Those who
are singing?

01:58.875 --> 02:02.491
They should be there, you see, that’s
why, they are not in tune with you.

02:02.516 --> 02:07.955
Come here, those who are singing.
That’s better, that’s the reason.

02:12.870 --> 02:16.627
You must sit with the musicians
and sing in tune, alright?

02:16.652 --> 02:18.944
Not without tune.

02:20.410 --> 02:23.680
Thus vibrations won’t come.

02:26.674 --> 02:31.188
Vibrations are not flowing.
Is better to sing…

02:31.802 --> 02:36.489
not in tune, better sing like that.

02:37.366 --> 02:41.054
They don’t know how to sing it.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.550
Who has fixed this?

02:58.396 --> 03:01.863
Catching on the Sahasrara.

03:11.250 --> 03:14.365
Make it in Indian tune.

03:31.665 --> 03:35.548
So that’s a very not proper way.
Let her sing,

03:35.573 --> 03:38.358
she knows. Let her sing,
she’ll tell you.

03:38.383 --> 03:41.178
You see, the vibrations could not
My Sahasrara’s caught up.

03:41.203 --> 03:44.440
Sit down, all of you sit down.

03:49.680 --> 03:53.205
These are mantras, this is not song,
is mantras, you see?

03:53.230 --> 03:58.151
Are to be said with deliberations
and understanding.

07:28.951 --> 07:32.661
You see, how it should be sung,
not that like

07:32.686 --> 07:36.321
a tiger is running after you.

07:36.346 --> 07:39.763
It's a deliberate thing, is mantras,
you see?

07:39.788 --> 07:43.047
Everybody has no right to sing
mantras also.

07:43.072 --> 07:46.405
You must sing with deliberations.

07:47.456 --> 07:49.000
Now let us hear how they sing,

07:49.025 --> 07:51.385
as I don’t want to catch again
My Sahasrara.

07:51.410 --> 07:55.118
Now which one, what one is
they were singing?

07:55.709 --> 07:58.279
What is the one they were singing?

07:58.304 --> 08:04.042
Yogi: The 10 names of Shri Lakshmi.
Shri Mataji: Ah?

08:04.067 --> 08:11.262
Yogi: The 10 names of Shri Lakshmi.
Or nine…

08:11.790 --> 08:16.699
Now. Do it slowly, steadily and without
hurrying up.

08:16.724 --> 08:20.194
And understanding what
you are saying.

08:20.219 --> 08:27.536
She rides on an elephant,
not in an aeroplane.

08:28.802 --> 08:33.672
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, shall we
sing it in one part or we can

08:33.697 --> 08:36.771
try to sing it in two parts?
Shri Mataji: No, one part.

08:36.796 --> 08:39.586
Two parts is not good. That also
is wrong. One part.

08:39.611 --> 08:42.447
One part and with deliberations,
see?

08:42.472 --> 08:45.235
Every word should be clear cut.

08:45.260 --> 08:52.785
Then it is a mantras, you see? These
are the words which are enlightened,

08:55.310 --> 08:59.112
and this is only very few people
have this Adhikara,

08:59.137 --> 09:04.745
you see - you have, because you are
sahaja yogis - to sing mantras.

09:04.770 --> 09:09.491
Now let’s have it. Not in parts,
sing it in one.

13:46.975 --> 13:53.926
SHRI NIRMALA DEVYAI NAMO NAMAH

13:53.951 --> 13:57.917
Good, beautiful, see the vibrations
started flowing.

13:57.942 --> 14:01.959
And now the meanings you know this.

14:01.984 --> 14:06.605
Now, today when we are doing
Lakshmi Puja

14:06.630 --> 14:14.821
all these are blessings on your
chakras

14:15.524 --> 14:19.225
which are bestowed upon. So it has
to be done in such a way

14:19.250 --> 14:23.038
that the deities should be happy
and you should get all the blessings.

14:23.063 --> 14:29.113
See these are mantras. There’s
a difference between a music and mantra.

14:29.138 --> 14:34.076
The mantras act on your chakras
and open that part in you

14:34.101 --> 14:38.620
and bestow that blessing of that mantra
upon you.

14:38.645 --> 14:42.531
This is the difference. Alright?

14:42.556 --> 14:44.800
So mantras should never be sung

14:44.825 --> 14:50.204
with a speed or just in a very
superficial way.

14:50.229 --> 14:55.177
It has to be very deep with feelings
and understanding.

14:55.202 --> 14:59.004
Now do you know the meaning
of all these Lakshmis?

14:59.029 --> 15:03.601
Can you tell them or should I
tell them?

15:12.485 --> 15:16.404
Give Me the page.

15:45.071 --> 15:51.732
Can I have My spectacles please?
No, I can read.

15:53.710 --> 15:59.497
Now first is the Adya Lakshmi. Adya is
the one who is the Primordial,

15:59.522 --> 16:02.165
Primordial Lakshmi.

16:02.165 --> 16:07.421
As I told you about, that She came
out of the Sea.

16:10.946 --> 16:19.931
So that’s what we call Christ’s Mother
was called as Mary, Maria,

16:19.956 --> 16:26.510
because She came from Marine. People
don’t know why she was called as Mary.

16:26.535 --> 16:34.353
My name also is as you know, is Nira,
meaning coming from water.

16:37.419 --> 16:44.975
Then the second one is Vidya Lakshmi.
She’s the one who teaches you

16:47.312 --> 16:55.965
the technique of handling the Divine
Power.

16:55.990 --> 16:59.783
Now this is to be understood very well.
What is a Lakshmi?

16:59.808 --> 17:02.885
Lakshmi is graciousness.

17:03.512 --> 17:12.094
So She teaches you how to use
this power with graciousness.

17:12.741 --> 17:18.584
Now, this is what is the blessing going
to you so that you get the power

17:18.609 --> 17:22.679
of Adya Lakshmi by which you become
like water

17:22.704 --> 17:27.974
and what is the water? It has a cleansing
power and it shines.

17:28.634 --> 17:32.517
Without water we cannot exist.
It’s life.

17:33.268 --> 17:39.405
So that’s the first blessing for you is
that the face shines with Adya Lakshmi,

17:39.430 --> 17:42.477
that you become cleansing

17:44.156 --> 17:51.270
and that you can sink all
that is material

17:51.295 --> 17:55.226
– all that is light can float
on you.

17:57.107 --> 18:00.708
Now. The Vidya Lakshmi is the one
as I told you gives you knowledge

18:00.733 --> 18:08.044
– knowledge how to handle the Divine
Power graciously.

18:08.069 --> 18:11.340
I’ll give you an example. I’ve seen
many people

18:11.365 --> 18:15.976
when they give bandhans, it’s such
a crude way, that.

18:16.001 --> 18:19.819
No, it is not to be done.
It’s a Lakshmi’s blessing.

18:19.844 --> 18:23.871
So how you do it, very carefully.
You see me, how I give always.

18:23.896 --> 18:31.341
I never do that way! I cannot!
With respect.

18:32.368 --> 18:36.895
With grace. She represents the respect
part of it.

18:36.920 --> 18:41.030
And that you get – that knowledge.
How to do it gracefully.

18:41.055 --> 18:47.389
Everything to be done gracefully
– in a manner that looks gracious.

18:47.414 --> 18:51.154
See, some people who talk have
no grace.

18:51.179 --> 18:54.030
Some people who give knowledge
of Sahaja Yoga

18:54.055 --> 19:00.481
also have no grace and they talk
in a disgraceful manner.

19:00.506 --> 19:06.313
So all the grace – how to use

19:06.338 --> 19:11.171
the knowledge of the Divine is given
by Vidya Lakshmi.

19:11.733 --> 19:18.185
Now Saubhagya Lakshmi. She’s the one
who gives you good fortune.

19:18.210 --> 19:23.342
Good fortune doesn’t mean money,
but it means the grace of money.

19:23.367 --> 19:28.138
Many people have money but it’s
like money on a donkey.

19:28.974 --> 19:32.763
You do not find any grace
in that person.

19:32.788 --> 19:36.224
Or it doesn’t also mean,
Saubhagya doesn’t mean

19:36.249 --> 19:40.662
only money – it means
all the good luck.

19:40.687 --> 19:44.827
All the good luck in everything in a very
gracious manner, is this.

19:44.852 --> 19:48.596
To you the blessings so that you
also are blessed

19:48.621 --> 19:54.603
as well as those people who’ll meet you
will be blessed, with Saubhagya.

19:55.827 --> 20:03.370
Amruta Lakshmi. Amrut means the one
that is the nectar.

20:03.395 --> 20:07.425
If you take that you will not die.
Means eternity.

20:07.450 --> 20:12.740
So She’s the one who gives you
the life of eternity.

20:12.765 --> 20:18.040
Gruha Lakshmi. Gruha Lakshmi is
the deity of the family

20:18.065 --> 20:22.780
- the one who is the deity of the family.
Now, any housewife

20:22.805 --> 20:27.644
need not be Gruha Lakshmi.
She can be a shrew.

20:27.669 --> 20:30.040
She can be a horrid thing.

20:30.065 --> 20:33.276
The deity of the household

20:33.301 --> 20:39.210
– if She resides in you, then you are
a Gruha Lakshmi, otherwise you are not.

20:41.004 --> 20:47.737
Then there is Raja Lakshmi. She is
the one who gives grace to the kings.

20:47.762 --> 20:53.703
If the kings behave like servants,
then they are not called as kings.

20:53.728 --> 21:00.717
They have to behave in a dignified manner.
The dignity, the majesty of the king

21:00.742 --> 21:04.659
comes from the Raja Lakshmi
in him.

21:04.684 --> 21:08.053
But a sahaja yogi need not
be training.

21:08.078 --> 21:13.014
He walks very straight in a very
stately manner.

21:13.039 --> 21:18.656
In his movements he’s stately. He’s very
majestic in handling people.

21:18.681 --> 21:21.634
He’s very gracious in doing
anything

21:21.659 --> 21:26.278
in such a manner that people think,
“Oh, here comes a king.”

21:27.146 --> 21:31.392
Satya Lakshmi. That is,

21:32.578 --> 21:37.608
that you get the awareness of truth,
but apart from that

21:37.633 --> 21:39.857
– the awareness of truth is there

21:39.882 --> 21:46.722
but to put this truth forward
in a gracious manner.

21:47.847 --> 21:52.631
Not to, “Now this is the truth
– have it!”. Not like that!

21:52.656 --> 21:55.420
Don’t have to hit people with
the truth.

21:55.445 --> 21:59.727
You have to put it in a flower and give
it to them. That is Satya Lakshmi.

21:59.752 --> 22:05.139
Of course the all Lakshmi Tattwas
are

22:06.167 --> 22:11.361
the parasympathetic powers
within us

22:11.386 --> 22:16.457
but they are actually expressed
in our brain.

22:16.482 --> 22:20.429
Brain is the Virata.

22:20.454 --> 22:25.622
Is the Vishnu when He becomes
the Virat – the Akbar.

22:25.647 --> 22:32.056
So all His powers are, specially these
powers are in the brain.

22:32.081 --> 22:37.276
So, the brain itself spontaneously
behaves

22:37.301 --> 22:45.670
in such a manner that people think that
this is a special type of a personality.

22:45.695 --> 22:48.445
Then we have got

22:52.980 --> 22:58.986
Bhogya Lakshmi, by which we know
how to enjoy.

22:59.011 --> 23:03.304
A sahaja yogi always knows how
to enjoy everything.

23:03.938 --> 23:06.514
He doesn’t…

23:11.901 --> 23:18.130
The sahaja yogi is never worried type.
Anything he can enjoy.

23:18.155 --> 23:24.357
Once, we climbed a very steep place,
called Palitana.

23:24.382 --> 23:30.691
It was about 6 miles above – like that -
as if walking for 6 miles – climbed up.

23:30.716 --> 23:34.579
I reached there and saw the beautiful
carvings.

23:34.604 --> 23:37.171
I was not tired at all when I saw
the carvings.

23:37.196 --> 23:39.266
And I was telling my son-in-law,
“See

23:39.291 --> 23:43.135
every tail of the elephants is made
differently.”

23:43.160 --> 23:49.676
He says: “Mother I’m panting here. How
can you see the tails of the elephants?”

23:49.701 --> 23:55.390
It is because I can enjoy. You should
be able to enjoy anything.

23:55.415 --> 23:59.743
Now supposing you see something
absurd – ridiculous.

23:59.768 --> 24:05.836
Then you should laugh and enjoy. This is
a ridiculous thing, you see? Is absurd.

24:05.861 --> 24:10.508
But one should not get angry with somebody
because somebody is absurd or funny.

24:10.533 --> 24:16.180
But should make it enjoyable.

24:16.205 --> 24:20.808
So that is the greatest, I think
one of the greatest blessings

24:20.833 --> 24:24.607
- that She gives you the power
to enjoy things.

24:24.632 --> 24:28.472
Otherwise whatever you may try people
don’t enjoy anything

24:28.497 --> 24:32.980
because they have become so ego-oriented
that nothing goes into their heads.

24:33.005 --> 24:37.074
They have to be tickled here
with the electrodes.

24:39.088 --> 24:44.249
Yoga Lakshmi – the one who gives
you Yoga.

24:44.274 --> 24:48.552
That power is within you. That is
the power of Lakshmi within you,

24:48.577 --> 24:54.258
means you give others the yoga.

24:54.894 --> 25:00.358
Now when you give the power

25:01.821 --> 25:07.276
of yoga to others, I mean when you use
your power of yoga,

25:07.301 --> 25:15.089
then you don’t behave like a monkey
or a donkey

25:15.114 --> 25:19.465
or a horse, but you do it
with grace.

25:19.490 --> 25:24.205
Do it in such a manner that it is
very gracious.

25:24.978 --> 25:30.837
That is what you call (searches English
term for word in Sanskrit)...

25:36.942 --> 25:41.793
Sahaja yogi: Gently?
Shri Mataji: Ah. In a gentle,

25:41.818 --> 25:46.025
dignified, majestic way.

25:46.951 --> 25:50.345
Gentle, dignified, majestic way

25:50.370 --> 25:55.222
– three words (in English) for one word
(in Sanskrit). So this is what it is.

25:55.247 --> 25:58.054
And now when you have sung it
in this manner,

25:58.079 --> 26:01.761
this power has been bestowed
upon you.

26:01.786 --> 26:06.614
Now even if you want you cannot
behave indecently.

26:07.818 --> 26:10.358
You are fixed.

26:12.018 --> 26:15.154
Alright. Thank you very much.
So mantras should be said

26:15.179 --> 26:21.379
deliberately with understanding. Like
the one you have made one poem – song.

26:21.404 --> 26:24.268
In that, you sing in a proper way.

26:24.293 --> 26:27.410
Never just go on: “Shri–this,
Shri-that, Shri…”.

26:27.435 --> 26:32.423
No, no, no. It’s like taking a role call
of the Lakshmi’s,

26:32.448 --> 26:36.190
“Are you there, are you there,
are you there”?. Like that.

26:37.193 --> 26:42.783
So now do it in a very deliberate manner
and with due respect and graciousness

26:42.808 --> 26:47.817
because specially with the Lakshmi’s thing
you have to be extremely gracious.

26:47.842 --> 26:55.460
You have to use very gentle words
and gentle tunes and gentle notes.

26:55.485 --> 26:56.808
All right.
