00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:45.584
Out of tune they are going.

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:50.131
They are going out of tune a little bit.
Let them go in tune, you see?

00:00:50.156 --> 00:00:55.598
One should not go in…speak with heart,
and speak with feelings,

00:00:55.623 --> 00:01:03.559
and should not be out of tune.
They are out of tune, very much.

00:01:04.037 --> 00:01:07.244
Do it properly. Now.

00:01:28.812 --> 00:01:32.218
Come along. Let’s have it again.

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.086
Must say in tune, in proper tune,
you see?

00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:46.976
Just without tune if you go out…
you play and then they should sing.

00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:58.850
Where are they? Those who
are singing?

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:02.491
They should be there, you see, that’s
why, they are not in tune with you.

00:02:02.516 --> 00:02:07.955
Come here, those who are singing.
That’s better, that’s the reason.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.627
You must sit with the musicians
and sing in tune, alright?

00:02:16.652 --> 00:02:18.944
Not without tune.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.680
Thus vibrations won’t come.

00:02:26.674 --> 00:02:31.188
Vibrations are not flowing.
Is better to sing…

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:36.489
not in tune, better sing like that.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:41.054
They don’t know how to sing it.

00:02:51.964 --> 00:02:54.550
Who has fixed this?

00:02:58.396 --> 00:03:01.863
Catching on the Sahasrara.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.365
Make it in Indian tune.

00:03:31.665 --> 00:03:35.548
So that’s a very not proper way.
Let her sing,

00:03:35.573 --> 00:03:38.358
she knows. Let her sing,
she’ll tell you.

00:03:38.383 --> 00:03:41.178
You see, the vibrations could not
My Sahasrara’s caught up.

00:03:41.203 --> 00:03:44.440
Sit down, all of you sit down.

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.205
These are mantras, this is not song,
is mantras, you see?

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:58.151
Are to be said with deliberations
and understanding.

00:07:28.951 --> 00:07:32.661
You see, how it should be sung,
not that like

00:07:32.686 --> 00:07:36.321
a tiger is running after you.

00:07:36.346 --> 00:07:39.763
It's a deliberate thing, is mantras,
you see?

00:07:39.788 --> 00:07:43.047
Everybody has no right to sing
mantras also.

00:07:43.072 --> 00:07:46.405
You must sing with deliberations.

00:07:47.456 --> 00:07:49.000
Now let us hear how they sing,

00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:51.385
as I don’t want to catch again
My Sahasrara.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.118
Now which one, what one is
they were singing?

00:07:55.709 --> 00:07:58.279
What is the one they were singing?

00:07:58.304 --> 00:08:04.042
Yogi: The 10 names of Shri Lakshmi.
Shri Mataji: Ah?

00:08:04.067 --> 00:08:11.262
Yogi: The 10 names of Shri Lakshmi.
Or nine…

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.699
Now. Do it slowly, steadily and without
hurrying up.

00:08:16.724 --> 00:08:20.194
And understanding what
you are saying.

00:08:20.219 --> 00:08:27.536
She rides on an elephant,
not in an aeroplane.

00:08:28.802 --> 00:08:33.672
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji, shall we
sing it in one part or we can

00:08:33.697 --> 00:08:36.771
try to sing it in two parts?
Shri Mataji: No, one part.

00:08:36.796 --> 00:08:39.586
Two parts is not good. That also
is wrong. One part.

00:08:39.611 --> 00:08:42.447
One part and with deliberations,
see?

00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:45.235
Every word should be clear cut.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:52.785
Then it is a mantras, you see? These
are the words which are enlightened,

00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:59.112
and this is only very few people
have this Adhikara,

00:08:59.137 --> 00:09:04.745
you see - you have, because you are
sahaja yogis - to sing mantras.

00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:09.491
Now let’s have it. Not in parts,
sing it in one.

00:09:35.237 --> 00:09:38.350

SHRI NIRMALA DEVYAI NAMO NAMAH

00:13:53.951 --> 00:13:57.917
Good, beautiful, see the vibrations
started flowing.

00:13:57.942 --> 00:14:01.959
And now the meanings you know this.

00:14:01.984 --> 00:14:06.605
Now, today when we are doing
Lakshmi Puja

00:14:06.630 --> 00:14:14.821
all these are blessings on your
chakras

00:14:15.524 --> 00:14:19.225
which are bestowed upon. So it has
to be done in such a way

00:14:19.250 --> 00:14:23.038
that the deities should be happy
and you should get all the blessings.

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:29.113
See these are mantras. There’s
a difference between a music and mantra.

00:14:29.138 --> 00:14:34.076
The mantras act on your chakras
and open that part in you

00:14:34.101 --> 00:14:38.620
and bestow that blessing of that mantra
upon you.

00:14:38.645 --> 00:14:42.531
This is the difference. Alright?

00:14:42.556 --> 00:14:44.800
So mantras should never be sung

00:14:44.825 --> 00:14:50.204
with a speed or just in a very
superficial way.

00:14:50.229 --> 00:14:55.177
It has to be very deep with feelings
and understanding.

00:14:55.202 --> 00:14:59.004
Now do you know the meaning
of all these Lakshmis?

00:14:59.029 --> 00:15:03.601
Can you tell them or should I
tell them?

00:15:12.485 --> 00:15:16.404
Give Me the page.

00:15:45.071 --> 00:15:51.732
Can I have My spectacles please?
No, I can read.

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:59.497
Now first is the Adya Lakshmi. Adya is
the one who is the Primordial,

00:15:59.522 --> 00:16:02.165
Primordial Lakshmi.

00:16:02.165 --> 00:16:07.421
As I told you about, that She came
out of the Sea.

00:16:10.946 --> 00:16:19.931
So that’s what we call Christ’s Mother
was called as Mary, Maria,

00:16:19.956 --> 00:16:26.510
because She came from Marine. People
don’t know why she was called as Mary.

00:16:26.535 --> 00:16:34.353
My name also is as you know, is Nira,
meaning coming from water.

00:16:37.419 --> 00:16:44.975
Then the second one is Vidya Lakshmi.
She’s the one who teaches you

00:16:47.312 --> 00:16:55.965
the technique of handling the Divine
Power.

00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:59.783
Now this is to be understood very well.
What is a Lakshmi?

00:16:59.808 --> 00:17:02.885
Lakshmi is graciousness.

00:17:03.512 --> 00:17:12.094
So She teaches you how to use
this power with graciousness.

00:17:12.741 --> 00:17:18.584
Now, this is what is the blessing going
to you so that you get the power

00:17:18.609 --> 00:17:22.679
of Adya Lakshmi by which you become
like water

00:17:22.704 --> 00:17:27.974
and what is the water? It has a cleansing
power and it shines.

00:17:28.634 --> 00:17:32.517
Without water we cannot exist.
It’s life.

00:17:33.268 --> 00:17:39.405
So that’s the first blessing for you is
that the face shines with Adya Lakshmi,

00:17:39.430 --> 00:17:42.477
that you become cleansing

00:17:44.156 --> 00:17:51.270
and that you can sink all
that is material

00:17:51.295 --> 00:17:55.226
– all that is light can float
on you.

00:17:57.107 --> 00:18:00.708
Now. The Vidya Lakshmi is the one
as I told you gives you knowledge

00:18:00.733 --> 00:18:08.044
– knowledge how to handle the Divine
Power graciously.

00:18:08.069 --> 00:18:11.340
I’ll give you an example. I’ve seen
many people

00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:15.976
when they give bandhans, it’s such
a crude way, that.

00:18:16.001 --> 00:18:19.819
No, it is not to be done.
It’s a Lakshmi’s blessing.

00:18:19.844 --> 00:18:23.871
So how you do it, very carefully.
You see me, how I give always.

00:18:23.896 --> 00:18:31.341
I never do that way! I cannot!
With respect.

00:18:32.368 --> 00:18:36.895
With grace. She represents the respect
part of it.

00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:41.030
And that you get – that knowledge.
How to do it gracefully.

00:18:41.055 --> 00:18:47.389
Everything to be done gracefully
– in a manner that looks gracious.

00:18:47.414 --> 00:18:51.154
See, some people who talk have
no grace.

00:18:51.179 --> 00:18:54.030
Some people who give knowledge
of Sahaja Yoga

00:18:54.055 --> 00:19:00.481
also have no grace and they talk
in a disgraceful manner.

00:19:00.506 --> 00:19:06.313
So all the grace – how to use

00:19:06.338 --> 00:19:11.171
the knowledge of the Divine is given
by Vidya Lakshmi.

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:18.185
Now Saubhagya Lakshmi. She’s the one
who gives you good fortune.

00:19:18.210 --> 00:19:23.342
Good fortune doesn’t mean money,
but it means the grace of money.

00:19:23.367 --> 00:19:28.138
Many people have money but it’s
like money on a donkey.

00:19:28.974 --> 00:19:32.763
You do not find any grace
in that person.

00:19:32.788 --> 00:19:36.224
Or it doesn’t also mean,
Saubhagya doesn’t mean

00:19:36.249 --> 00:19:40.662
only money – it means
all the good luck.

00:19:40.687 --> 00:19:44.827
All the good luck in everything in a very
gracious manner, is this.

00:19:44.852 --> 00:19:48.596
To you the blessings so that you
also are blessed

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:54.603
as well as those people who’ll meet you
will be blessed, with Saubhagya.

00:19:55.827 --> 00:20:03.370
Amruta Lakshmi. Amrut means the one
that is the nectar.

00:20:03.395 --> 00:20:07.425
If you take that you will not die.
Means eternity.

00:20:07.450 --> 00:20:12.740
So She’s the one who gives you
the life of eternity.

00:20:12.765 --> 00:20:18.040
Gruha Lakshmi. Gruha Lakshmi is
the deity of the family

00:20:18.065 --> 00:20:22.780
- the one who is the deity of the family.
Now, any housewife

00:20:22.805 --> 00:20:27.644
need not be Gruha Lakshmi.
She can be a shrew.

00:20:27.669 --> 00:20:30.040
She can be a horrid thing.

00:20:30.065 --> 00:20:33.276
The deity of the household

00:20:33.301 --> 00:20:39.210
– if She resides in you, then you are
a Gruha Lakshmi, otherwise you are not.

00:20:41.004 --> 00:20:47.737
Then there is Raja Lakshmi. She is
the one who gives grace to the kings.

00:20:47.762 --> 00:20:53.703
If the kings behave like servants,
then they are not called as kings.

00:20:53.728 --> 00:21:00.717
They have to behave in a dignified manner.
The dignity, the majesty of the king

00:21:00.742 --> 00:21:04.659
comes from the Raja Lakshmi
in him.

00:21:04.684 --> 00:21:08.053
But a sahaja yogi need not
be training.

00:21:08.078 --> 00:21:13.014
He walks very straight in a very
stately manner.

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:18.656
In his movements he’s stately. He’s very
majestic in handling people.

00:21:18.681 --> 00:21:21.634
He’s very gracious in doing
anything

00:21:21.659 --> 00:21:26.278
in such a manner that people think,
“Oh, here comes a king.”

00:21:27.146 --> 00:21:31.392
Satya Lakshmi. That is,

00:21:32.578 --> 00:21:37.608
that you get the awareness of truth,
but apart from that

00:21:37.633 --> 00:21:39.857
– the awareness of truth is there

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:46.722
but to put this truth forward
in a gracious manner.

00:21:47.847 --> 00:21:52.631
Not to, “Now this is the truth
– have it!”. Not like that!

00:21:52.656 --> 00:21:55.420
Don’t have to hit people with
the truth.

00:21:55.445 --> 00:21:59.727
You have to put it in a flower and give
it to them. That is Satya Lakshmi.

00:21:59.752 --> 00:22:05.139
Of course the all Lakshmi Tattwas
are

00:22:06.167 --> 00:22:11.361
the parasympathetic powers
within us

00:22:11.386 --> 00:22:16.457
but they are actually expressed
in our brain.

00:22:16.482 --> 00:22:20.429
Brain is the Virata.

00:22:20.454 --> 00:22:25.622
Is the Vishnu when He becomes
the Virat – the Akbar.

00:22:25.647 --> 00:22:32.056
So all His powers are, specially these
powers are in the brain.

00:22:32.081 --> 00:22:37.276
So, the brain itself spontaneously
behaves

00:22:37.301 --> 00:22:45.670
in such a manner that people think that
this is a special type of a personality.

00:22:45.695 --> 00:22:48.445
Then we have got

00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:58.986
Bhogya Lakshmi, by which we know
how to enjoy.

00:22:59.011 --> 00:23:03.304
A sahaja yogi always knows how
to enjoy everything.

00:23:03.938 --> 00:23:06.514
He doesn’t…

00:23:11.901 --> 00:23:18.130
The sahaja yogi is never worried type.
Anything he can enjoy.

00:23:18.155 --> 00:23:24.357
Once, we climbed a very steep place,
called Palitana.

00:23:24.382 --> 00:23:30.691
It was about 6 miles above – like that -
as if walking for 6 miles – climbed up.

00:23:30.716 --> 00:23:34.579
I reached there and saw the beautiful
carvings.

00:23:34.604 --> 00:23:37.171
I was not tired at all when I saw
the carvings.

00:23:37.196 --> 00:23:39.266
And I was telling my son-in-law,
“See

00:23:39.291 --> 00:23:43.135
every tail of the elephants is made
differently.”

00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:49.676
He says: “Mother I’m panting here. How
can you see the tails of the elephants?”

00:23:49.701 --> 00:23:55.390
It is because I can enjoy. You should
be able to enjoy anything.

00:23:55.415 --> 00:23:59.743
Now supposing you see something
absurd – ridiculous.

00:23:59.768 --> 00:24:05.836
Then you should laugh and enjoy. This is
a ridiculous thing, you see? Is absurd.

00:24:05.861 --> 00:24:10.508
But one should not get angry with somebody
because somebody is absurd or funny.

00:24:10.533 --> 00:24:16.180
But should make it enjoyable.

00:24:16.205 --> 00:24:20.808
So that is the greatest, I think
one of the greatest blessings

00:24:20.833 --> 00:24:24.607
- that She gives you the power
to enjoy things.

00:24:24.632 --> 00:24:28.472
Otherwise whatever you may try people
don’t enjoy anything

00:24:28.497 --> 00:24:32.980
because they have become so ego-oriented
that nothing goes into their heads.

00:24:33.005 --> 00:24:37.074
They have to be tickled here
with the electrodes.

00:24:39.088 --> 00:24:44.249
Yoga Lakshmi – the one who gives
you Yoga.

00:24:44.274 --> 00:24:48.552
That power is within you. That is
the power of Lakshmi within you,

00:24:48.577 --> 00:24:54.258
means you give others the yoga.

00:24:54.894 --> 00:25:00.358
Now when you give the power

00:25:01.821 --> 00:25:07.276
of yoga to others, I mean when you use
your power of yoga,

00:25:07.301 --> 00:25:15.089
then you don’t behave like a monkey
or a donkey

00:25:15.114 --> 00:25:19.465
or a horse, but you do it
with grace.

00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:24.205
Do it in such a manner that it is
very gracious.

00:25:24.978 --> 00:25:30.837
That is what you call (searches English
term for word in Sanskrit)...

00:25:36.942 --> 00:25:41.793
Sahaja yogi: Gently?
Shri Mataji: Ah. In a gentle,

00:25:41.818 --> 00:25:46.025
dignified, majestic way.

00:25:46.951 --> 00:25:50.345
Gentle, dignified, majestic way

00:25:50.370 --> 00:25:55.222
– three words (in English) for one word
(in Sanskrit). So this is what it is.

00:25:55.247 --> 00:25:58.054
And now when you have sung it
in this manner,

00:25:58.079 --> 00:26:01.761
this power has been bestowed
upon you.

00:26:01.786 --> 00:26:06.614
Now even if you want you cannot
behave indecently.

00:26:07.818 --> 00:26:10.358
You are fixed.

00:26:12.018 --> 00:26:15.154
Alright. Thank you very much.
So mantras should be said

00:26:15.179 --> 00:26:21.379
deliberately with understanding. Like
the one you have made one poem – song.

00:26:21.404 --> 00:26:24.268
In that, you sing in a proper way.

00:26:24.293 --> 00:26:27.410
Never just go on: “Shri–this,
Shri-that, Shri…”.

00:26:27.435 --> 00:26:32.423
No, no, no. It’s like taking a role call
of the Lakshmi’s,

00:26:32.448 --> 00:26:36.190
“Are you there, are you there,
are you there”?. Like that.

00:26:37.193 --> 00:26:42.783
So now do it in a very deliberate manner
and with due respect and graciousness

00:26:42.808 --> 00:26:47.817
because specially with the Lakshmi’s thing
you have to be extremely gracious.

00:26:47.842 --> 00:26:55.460
You have to use very gentle words
and gentle tunes and gentle notes.

00:26:55.485 --> 00:26:56.808
All right.
