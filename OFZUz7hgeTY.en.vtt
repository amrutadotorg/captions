WEBVTT

00:29.690 --> 00:33.960
We have gathered here on the occassion of Ram Navami

00:33.970 --> 00:36.020
everybody has said

00:36.030 --> 00:41.930
Mother please tell us about Shri Ram

00:41.940 --> 00:50.990
As you know that Shri Rama has taken
a very important place in our chakras

00:51.000 --> 00:58.330
He is sitting on our right heart

00:58.340 --> 01:06.230
Shri Rama has taken a place of a father

01:06.240 --> 01:22.167
so lack of father's duty and love
can cause a catch of this chakra

01:24.610 --> 01:29.833
In Sahaja Yoga we can understand
that Rama and all other gods

01:29.900 --> 01:36.760
came on earth with different power (shakti),

01:36.770 --> 01:44.850
they came to do their jobs

01:44.891 --> 01:49.676
In the sense Shri Rama has a special job

01:52.190 --> 01:58.050
Socrates has said
benevolent king has to come

01:58.060 --> 02:02.532
For that Shri Rama came

02:03.790 --> 02:08.670
Shri Rama came in complete human form

02:08.680 --> 02:12.020
He even forgot that

02:12.030 --> 02:16.730
he is a incarnation of Shri Vishnu
He was made to be forgotten

02:16.740 --> 02:26.740
But he was Purushottam on earth
(perfect human being)

02:26.750 --> 02:35.470
you all must have heard of
his qualities and his childhood

02:35.480 --> 02:43.006
In Sahaja yoga
when we worship any god

02:44.700 --> 02:58.120
what quality we gain from them

02:58.130 --> 03:01.760
which qualities we will receive?

03:01.770 --> 03:04.220
Shri Rama has many

03:04.230 --> 03:15.230
One that he was ideal
another that he is a king

03:15.240 --> 03:20.350
he kept his people higher than himself

03:20.360 --> 03:25.320
than his wife and children

03:25.330 --> 03:33.610
If politicians today

03:33.620 --> 03:38.160
understand this point

03:38.170 --> 03:42.260
they wouldn't be called selfish

03:42.270 --> 03:44.450
they wouldn't be selfish

03:44.460 --> 03:46.800
would be follower of Dharma.

03:46.810 --> 03:49.040
Nobody has followed

03:49.050 --> 03:56.040
Shri Rama as a role model
till today

03:56.050 --> 03:59.000
By singing his bhajans

03:59.010 --> 04:06.221
or building an institutions and temples
in his name

04:06.554 --> 04:11.700
Shri Rama come to you?

04:11.710 --> 04:15.440
Do you get his light in your life?

04:15.497 --> 04:24.736
Only sahaj yogi can bring the light
of Shri Rama into the attention

04:26.467 --> 04:29.626
He is totally beyond

04:29.660 --> 04:34.425
Basically all the deities are
free from papas and punyas

04:34.450 --> 04:40.605
so called sins
they never sin

04:40.615 --> 04:43.965
Shri Krishna killed many people

04:44.092 --> 04:48.253
Shri Rama killed Ravana

04:48.263 --> 04:53.215
It can be a sin in worldly sense

04:53.240 --> 04:56.325
but not in the eyes of god

04:56.627 --> 05:08.560
As they destroy and remove evils
they have rights to do anything

05:08.585 --> 05:16.670
When Devi slayed Rakshas
she has committed a sin?

05:16.680 --> 05:26.219
Their work is to destroy the
rakshas and protect the saints

05:29.090 --> 05:37.785
In Shri Rama's life Ahilya's saving is
the most important

05:37.785 --> 05:41.656
she was cursed by her husband

05:42.273 --> 05:47.222
In those times if any women
goes out of dharma

05:47.247 --> 05:53.535
and if her husband is high saint
he could curse

05:54.885 --> 05:59.395
But Ahillya was blamed falsely

05:59.427 --> 06:04.801
And she was made into stone falsely

06:05.080 --> 06:10.030
So shri Rama saved Ahilya

06:10.040 --> 06:23.099
Especially his quality to have only one wife

06:23.583 --> 06:28.423
his love to one wife must be understood

06:30.050 --> 06:36.505
Even though he knew Sitaji is Mahalaxmi
she herself is a Goddess

06:36.505 --> 06:46.065
But as a Human he never looked
at any other women but his wife

06:46.090 --> 06:51.589
When we talk about Rama
we should have the husband pure

06:51.827 --> 06:55.753
To worships shri Rama

06:56.026 --> 07:06.145
Women should have the same faith
in husbands as Sitaji used to

07:06.251 --> 07:12.423
Husbands also need the quality of Shri Ram
who believed one wife

07:12.448 --> 07:15.375
Not difficult for sahaja yogis

07:15.400 --> 07:20.350
Women should be respected
Have respect for wifes

07:20.360 --> 07:24.360
When Ravana kidnapped Sitaji

07:24.370 --> 07:30.025
Shri Rama felt his duty
to rescue her

07:30.025 --> 07:37.650
But in his kingdom
he was so just that

07:37.660 --> 07:43.990
For people he left her
after spending so many years to rescue

07:44.000 --> 07:50.140
As Sitaji herself a Devi
so there's no effect

07:50.150 --> 07:54.026
So Shri Rama did it

07:54.105 --> 08:00.547
to keep the benevolence
of public opinion

08:00.666 --> 08:04.660
that society wouln't accpect the women

08:04.685 --> 08:10.650
who are questioned.

08:11.737 --> 08:17.108
Although she is a Devi
Pure and Nirmala

08:17.133 --> 08:21.536
Later that
Sita also left him somehow

08:21.740 --> 08:28.235
She left him as a woman
and Shri Rama as a man

08:28.260 --> 08:36.554
Sitaji disappeared into the mother earth
and Shri Rama went into River Sarayu

08:36.873 --> 08:43.638
Their life is very eventful
and full of Miracles

08:43.805 --> 08:53.137
You see how shri Sita and Rama
have good attitude and are faithful each other

08:53.170 --> 08:59.215
Even if she was left
Sita thought it her duty

08:59.215 --> 09:05.305
She never complained
or talked ill of him

09:05.330 --> 09:11.787
And effortlessly
she has raised her children

09:12.515 --> 09:17.952
Shri Rama's children are
called Luv and Kush

09:17.995 --> 09:26.854
They came as devotees
and we can see them as disciples

09:27.050 --> 09:30.090
They represents Shisya (disciples)

09:30.100 --> 09:38.090
the power of Shisya
so we can be disciple of someone

09:38.100 --> 09:44.120
As disciples they learned archery
when they were small

09:44.130 --> 09:51.538
And learned Ramayana
and got proficiency in the music

09:51.910 --> 09:59.435
Showing the disciples must surrender completely
to the Guru

09:59.445 --> 10:04.065
We also have a disciples in us

10:04.090 --> 10:11.548
They were  completely surrendered to
the Mother who is Shakti

10:11.830 --> 10:17.500
Even they were about to fight
against Shri Rama

10:17.525 --> 10:21.000
they kept Mother highest in the world

10:21.000 --> 10:27.670
The mother cared them
and made them completely dharmic

10:27.680 --> 10:30.590
It was her first duty

10:30.600 --> 10:35.650
Not like today wives just cry
"my husband left me"

10:35.660 --> 10:41.643
But with husband they fight always
and if he leaves they will cry

10:41.830 --> 10:50.437
He has left no problem
I have children, I will care for them

10:50.470 --> 10:55.430
they will get all they need

10:55.440 --> 11:05.210
Sitaj's life was special
with bravery and strength

11:05.220 --> 11:08.130
Every woman must have it

11:08.140 --> 11:13.200
Even if you are separated with your
husband or far away

11:13.210 --> 11:21.000
there shouldn't be any loss
or shortage for children

11:21.145 --> 11:26.673
Because her duty
is the most important thing

11:26.870 --> 11:30.018
We shouldn't give up
most important thing

11:30.204 --> 11:36.775
In sahaja yoga
all women should get this power

11:37.570 --> 11:41.970
Shri Rama's life was
very pure and Nirmal

11:41.980 --> 11:45.040
he gave up everything
for his wife

11:45.960 --> 11:57.320
His wife had gone, he had to live alone
and he had to leave her

11:57.330 --> 12:01.680
He gave up all the comforts of the life

12:01.690 --> 12:08.880
You know he used to sleep
on grass, on floor and walked barefeet

12:08.890 --> 12:12.476
and wear clothes like saints

12:13.280 --> 12:16.250
All these are not stories
it's a fact

12:16.260 --> 12:24.350
In India many people used to have
high standard life

12:24.360 --> 12:28.170
and they have never thought about
small and low level things

12:28.180 --> 12:37.266
But all these ideals of our country
have beccome fake

12:37.291 --> 12:44.085
By singing bhajans to Ram
we think we are done

12:44.085 --> 12:47.215
we have got a kind of hypocracy

12:47.501 --> 12:51.047
In countries without
these ideals

12:51.072 --> 12:56.415
people try to become the ideals
correcting themselves

12:56.471 --> 13:01.206
If you have the ideal in front of us

13:01.260 --> 13:05.560
you don't  become Shri Rama or Krishna

13:05.570 --> 13:08.100
or you have anything to do with them

13:08.110 --> 13:10.430
We feel like that

13:10.440 --> 13:17.053
But if we have Shri Rama inside
his light can be in our attention

13:17.108 --> 13:20.148
Let's understand

13:20.307 --> 13:26.691
the circumstances when
Shri Rama came on earth

13:26.819 --> 13:29.313
Sahaja Yogi must understand

13:29.346 --> 13:39.320
If we get Shri Rama's state
All our political problems will go

13:39.330 --> 13:44.403
when we decide to
become like shri Rama

13:59.893 --> 14:03.620
Then everyone becomes good

14:03.630 --> 14:15.150
firstly dharma, success and education
then the ideals

14:15.160 --> 14:22.290
for that he made his life very idealistic

14:22.300 --> 14:29.270
When someone tells you something
but he doesn't do it himself

14:29.280 --> 14:33.852
Then how can you trust him and get his quality

14:33.892 --> 14:38.110
There are many people who say
we believe in this and that

14:38.120 --> 14:41.080
But they are opposite

14:41.090 --> 14:50.014
Followers of Ram seems to be the biggest fraud politician
and they have many wives, impossible

14:50.420 --> 14:55.710
What is the duty of Sahaja Yogis' life?

14:55.860 --> 15:01.191
we have to bring the light of god
in our attention

15:01.509 --> 15:06.875
We must see and behave as Shri Rama

15:07.193 --> 15:14.518
What would Shri Rama or Sita do
in this situation

15:14.528 --> 15:20.195
What would Sita ji say?

15:20.220 --> 15:24.474
How would Sita behave?
She is also Gruhlaxmi

15:24.585 --> 15:30.100
As you know Sitaji took many births

15:30.110 --> 15:36.670
Gruhlaxmi was in the form of Fatima-bi

15:36.695 --> 15:43.855
She was humbly in the house but all
dharma was done by her power

15:43.855 --> 15:50.165
Not necessary for her to go out
and give big lectures

15:50.190 --> 16:00.050
You can do that work at home
with children relatives and friends

16:00.075 --> 16:04.940
you can spread sahaja Yoga at the house

16:04.940 --> 16:09.170
After getting all of it
you can go out to society

16:09.180 --> 16:19.660
But ladies have to have purity like Sitaji first

16:19.670 --> 16:23.920
First thing of the purity is
motherhood and love

16:23.930 --> 16:30.550
When she was in exile never complained
that my husband doesn't earn

16:30.560 --> 16:35.765
He doesn't do this
he doesn't buy this and that

16:35.765 --> 16:40.820
If he is in jungle so I am
What he will eat I wil

16:40.845 --> 16:45.627
I don't eat before him
I serve him first

16:45.777 --> 16:49.991
and  brother in law then I will eat

16:50.071 --> 17:04.070
Nowadays women think there is
much pressure of the work But it is not

17:04.468 --> 17:11.026
A woman is like earth element
she can absorb

17:11.257 --> 17:15.972
So many are given by the earth

17:15.997 --> 17:20.780
In the same way
women are like the earth

17:20.805 --> 17:25.831
We have got so many powers
that we can take everything inside

17:25.911 --> 17:32.212
and shower the rain of love
God has given us the power

17:32.251 --> 17:42.162
For example this fan is moving
Which one is greater, the power or fan?

17:43.820 --> 17:50.550
If you think fan is greater as  it's moving
Then it's wrong

17:50.550 --> 17:54.890
Women are ocean of shakti

17:54.915 --> 17:59.765
With that support Men does their work

17:59.790 --> 18:07.029
They are potential and kinetic
Women are potential and men are kinetic

18:07.132 --> 18:12.345
But if you start running like them

18:12.345 --> 18:15.695
It's not good
No need for women

18:15.720 --> 18:25.376
Each one is unique but equally important
But women can be good for both

18:25.456 --> 18:30.015
When the time comes
women can be more productive

18:30.040 --> 18:36.550
In Maharashtra
there was a 17-year-old widow named Tarabai

18:36.560 --> 18:40.960
She was the daughter-in-law of Shivaji

18:40.970 --> 18:45.390
Only she could defeat Aurangzeb

18:45.400 --> 18:48.495
Her grave was built

18:48.495 --> 19:02.109
You must understand women can keep all her
power within her to become ferocious

19:02.231 --> 19:14.530
But  if she waste her powers in
fighting, arguing, complaining or in frivolous things

19:14.540 --> 19:17.660
then her power would be gone

19:17.670 --> 19:25.960
Women are so powerful that
she can work more than men if she want

19:25.970 --> 19:29.437
But first of all
she must respect her powers

19:29.454 --> 19:35.623
by scattering and wasting she becomes powerless

19:35.655 --> 19:38.274
this kind of woman is not good

19:38.488 --> 19:45.534
Women's job is very important and full of dignity

19:45.653 --> 19:50.221
Women should be very modest and very wise

19:50.325 --> 19:55.115
Let Men use bad words but women cannot

19:55.312 --> 20:01.779
Men can argue and would fight
let them do but not Women

20:01.819 --> 20:09.803
Their job is to make peace, protection and helping people

20:10.144 --> 20:17.490
She is like shield not like sword
and sword cannot be shield

20:17.500 --> 20:24.440
Shield is greater than sword
as shield can bear the sword

20:24.465 --> 20:28.910
Sword can be broken
but not shield

20:28.910 --> 20:37.530
So her most important power is humility

20:37.540 --> 20:41.540
With humility comes all the powers

20:41.550 --> 20:46.370
It's not difficult for sahaj yogis
not at all

20:46.380 --> 20:50.440
I see many sahaja yoginis chat a lot

20:50.450 --> 20:54.140
anywhere they will chat with men

20:54.150 --> 20:58.430
"Mother help me" "what happened"

20:58.440 --> 21:02.990
"The lady talks a lot please help me"

21:03.000 --> 21:05.915
"I am tired of her"

21:05.925 --> 21:11.171
There isn't much to talk with men
What's the need?

21:11.411 --> 21:14.773
Among women also

21:14.873 --> 21:20.435
In sahaja yoga men study more

21:20.435 --> 21:22.795
About Sahaja Yoga and the chakras

21:22.820 --> 21:30.690
Which chakra is driving people and is catching?

21:30.700 --> 21:34.580
Man knows all
women would be left behind

21:34.590 --> 21:36.492
Women must learn

21:36.642 --> 21:43.055
For men Shri Rama is our ideal

21:43.080 --> 21:48.755
In this sense Muslims are amazing

21:48.760 --> 21:52.185
I don't want to say bad things

21:52.210 --> 21:58.870
Say if you go to Riyad
no  Muslim will see you

21:58.880 --> 22:03.500
they will respect women
If women are crossing the street

22:03.510 --> 22:07.670
they will stop the car
respecting women

22:07.680 --> 22:12.540
But here it's opposite
I don't know why

22:12.550 --> 22:17.100
we see women with some intention

22:17.110 --> 22:22.190
Seeing every woman
they will break the neck

22:22.200 --> 22:26.710
It's a big sin to see every woman

22:26.729 --> 22:30.609
In sahaja yoga it's prohibited completely

22:30.634 --> 22:35.905
Firstly you will spoil your eyes and Sahaja Yoga

22:35.930 --> 22:40.950
Otherwise you may become blind

22:40.960 --> 22:45.060
Sometimes I see people have wandering eyes

22:45.085 --> 22:49.435
While talking eyes are wandering
women too

22:49.460 --> 22:54.750
The biggest loss is your attention

22:54.760 --> 22:57.990
Your attention goes here and there

22:58.015 --> 23:02.375
then what's the use of self-realization

23:02.385 --> 23:08.710
Without concentration Chitta can't be active

23:08.720 --> 23:13.900
Concentration must be obtained

23:13.933 --> 23:18.573
In the west the disease is
more common among men

23:18.605 --> 23:24.505
Western yogis are not alike
They know it's bad

23:24.610 --> 23:28.620
They asked me the solution

23:28.630 --> 23:38.135
Look at only ground and up to 3 feets
you don't have to see above

23:38.160 --> 23:46.530
Look at the ground
Yogis are walking looking at the ground abroad

23:46.540 --> 23:56.700
You see all good things, flowers and children
Nothing to see above

23:56.710 --> 24:00.240
So, that's how you should control your chitta

24:00.240 --> 24:06.100
Shri Rama didn't need it
If you have a respect to shri Rama

24:06.125 --> 24:10.825
You must control your chitta like him

24:10.850 --> 24:22.098
Tell your wife you respect her as shakti
But she has to deserve it

24:22.208 --> 24:26.475
"Yatr naryan pujante tatr ramante devata"

24:26.500 --> 24:37.314
"Where women are respected resides
god" But they have to be respectable

24:37.600 --> 24:41.108
Please sit down

24:41.322 --> 24:46.100
Don't move during Puja

24:46.100 --> 24:51.840
If the woman is worshipable
"Pujyante" means "worshipable"

24:51.840 --> 24:59.990
Who like to worship a bad woman
cruel Rakshasi?

24:59.990 --> 25:07.350
Those who are worshpable should be worshipped
There resides gods

25:07.350 --> 25:12.256
Firstly they are mothers of children

25:12.281 --> 25:17.304
If husband scolds wife in front of children

25:17.340 --> 25:21.860
then children will never respect mother

25:21.885 --> 25:25.995
It's prime minister and deputy minister

25:26.020 --> 25:29.080
Women shouldn't insult her husband too

25:29.080 --> 25:37.030
Power goes to children from father

25:37.070 --> 25:45.487
Without this basic understanding
they fight to take control

25:45.565 --> 25:50.010
If woman knows handling of man
there won't be any fights

25:50.035 --> 25:56.290
Handling men is very easy
as they are just like children

25:56.290 --> 26:01.975
they are innocent like children

26:01.975 --> 26:05.615
By talking nonsense
you can't handle them

26:05.640 --> 26:08.884
You must forgive them as children

26:09.095 --> 26:12.675
If they fight outside
they get troubled

26:12.700 --> 26:16.140
They can get angry only to wife

26:16.165 --> 26:19.225
Getting angry at home is OK

26:19.250 --> 26:28.387
Until you get this feeling, you cannot have
mutual understanding, love and joy

26:28.562 --> 26:34.482
Men also should care for wife's needs

26:34.507 --> 26:46.465
if wife is wrong, husband has duty to say no
"It's wrong, I won't do this"

26:46.465 --> 26:52.885
But no need to fight on small things
It doesn't look good as sahaja yogis

26:52.910 --> 26:56.640
I am surprised that
Sahaja couples fight each other

26:56.640 --> 27:02.570
They come to complain about each other

27:02.595 --> 27:11.795
How come sahaja couple cannot be together peacefully
while I'm talking about peace to the whole world

27:11.820 --> 27:15.080
It won't work out if you are fighting like that

27:15.080 --> 27:23.239
Husband has to have complete
understanding of his wife first

27:23.310 --> 27:31.890
And know that all the other women
are like your sisters and mothers

27:31.915 --> 27:36.695
If someone is not clean even after Sahaja Yoga
then there's no way out

27:36.695 --> 27:41.725
There was a swiss man
not a Sahaja Yogi

27:41.725 --> 27:47.630
Not Indian
He was a father of a Sahaja Yogini

27:47.630 --> 27:54.475
Girl's husband had wandering
eyes but came to sahaja yoga

27:54.500 --> 28:02.498
They both came to Sahaja Yoga
The girl is very good but he went on doing it

28:02.617 --> 28:07.800
The non-yogi father told her to leave him

28:07.800 --> 28:14.160
"Even after sahaja yoga if he can't be cleansed
then leave him"

28:14.160 --> 28:22.300
"He is not a Sahaja Yogi don't relate with him"

28:22.310 --> 28:31.340
Even Non-Sahaja Yogi can understand
that the person can't be cleansed

28:31.340 --> 28:38.150
He doesn't have stable attention
then it is bad

28:38.150 --> 28:45.710
Our culture is that men and women
must be brother and sister

28:45.710 --> 28:52.670
But I see a talkative woman
just go to talk to men

28:52.670 --> 29:01.380
I don't understand it
They don't sit with other ladies but with men

29:01.380 --> 29:07.055
Same with men just start chatting with women

29:07.055 --> 29:17.225
Even with maid or anyone
just start talking, no self-esteem

29:17.250 --> 29:24.670
We think it's masculinity but Shri Rama is
the perfect man who is highest

29:24.680 --> 29:30.670
But the one at the bottom
think they are perfect

29:30.670 --> 29:35.950
Where is perfection?
Not believing in Shri Rama but in devil

29:35.960 --> 29:39.600
If you believe in Shri Rama
follow his ideal

29:39.600 --> 29:45.036
Therefore children and women
are getting spoiled

29:45.075 --> 29:50.550
But still Indian women maintained
good culture here

29:50.550 --> 30:00.370
If they were like Americans what it would have been
Men are fixed in terrible condition there

30:00.370 --> 30:13.970
After 2-3 marriages Men becomes
bunkrupt but women make a palace

30:13.970 --> 30:18.000
It's bad in America
Children are running away from home

30:18.000 --> 30:27.140
Indian woman manage their house
husband and children

30:27.140 --> 30:33.015
But it's changing
They think the same like husbands

30:33.040 --> 30:38.440
If he runs away with 10 women
then we go with 15 men

30:38.440 --> 30:44.290
If he is going to hell then I go before him

30:44.290 --> 30:49.625
Women shouldn't do it
The base of dharma is in woman's hand

30:49.625 --> 30:57.245
Woman must manage husband dharmic
making him understand

30:57.270 --> 31:02.847
This is the biggest duty and power
of woman to be Dharmaic

31:02.872 --> 31:10.510
Biggest dharma is forgiveness
Without it nothing works out

31:10.510 --> 31:15.760
First thing she must have forgiveness
Forgive children, husband

31:15.760 --> 31:20.220
give refuge to house servants
all are her duty

31:20.245 --> 31:30.841
This is the work that Shri Rama couldn't do
neither Shri Krishna nor Shri Jesus

31:31.033 --> 31:44.010
Rama would have killed everyone
who is useless, adharmic and flirt

31:44.010 --> 31:47.420
Don't know how many he would be finished

31:47.420 --> 31:53.030
Krishna would use his sudarshan
chakra and there would be a battle

31:53.040 --> 31:56.265
Christ would crucify himself

31:56.265 --> 32:02.535
One crucifiction is better than everyday

32:02.560 --> 32:08.690
Only Mother can do this work
With such a power of love

32:08.690 --> 32:13.263
Anything can be worked out with her power of love

32:13.295 --> 32:19.920
She holds everything with so much love
that children don't mind correcting

32:19.920 --> 32:27.360
For instance when trouble comes only mother
knows how to handle it and scold later

32:27.360 --> 32:32.580
Because children understands mother's love
and it is for them

32:32.580 --> 32:40.290
With father children may react
but not with mother's love without expectation

32:40.290 --> 32:49.425
She doesn't want anything but her children to be good
and get all my powers, all good in me

32:49.425 --> 32:54.485
If mother feels it children will be fine

32:54.510 --> 33:01.960
But some mothers are very interfering
and get involved in everything

33:01.960 --> 33:06.290
She comes always in front
while husband is at the back

33:06.300 --> 33:09.290
Children will be spoiled by it

33:09.290 --> 33:17.363
Under such harmful environment children
can be very emotional

33:17.363 --> 33:22.515
So woman should be behind
and make her husband in front

33:22.540 --> 33:27.200
Whatever husbands do
wifes must help him behind

33:27.200 --> 33:36.590
The source of his power is wife
Then how pure and hard-working she should be

33:36.590 --> 33:43.420
I put everything on woman
because I know you have great powers inside

33:43.430 --> 33:48.410
Look at me as a Mother
I must make everyone saints

33:48.410 --> 33:53.340
Curing many diseases
to make people saints

33:53.340 --> 33:58.490
Did anyone do this job?
Only Ahilya was saved

33:58.490 --> 34:01.755
Jesus saved 21 people

34:01.755 --> 34:05.035
I must have saved 21000 now

34:05.060 --> 34:10.065
Going around the world to do
everyone's job

34:10.065 --> 34:16.755
it's still going on but I don't feel
because of love

34:16.780 --> 34:23.800
Maybe I should put bandhan
as I don't know what kind of people I meet

34:23.800 --> 34:28.280
But as soon as people comes to me
I absorb all the problems

34:28.280 --> 34:35.805
So love acts by itself
I know everything is done by love

34:35.830 --> 34:42.783
I don't feel bad whatever happens
Only Mother can bear the pain

34:42.942 --> 34:51.360
So I want you to grow consistantly
without hurdles

34:51.370 --> 34:59.820
Also men should help their wives fully
Understand and respect them

34:59.830 --> 35:09.131
Until the 2 wheels gets balanced
the chariot doesn't go forward

35:10.430 --> 35:16.945
They both should be the same but
one on the left and the other on the right

35:17.410 --> 35:21.830
It won't work if you change it

35:21.830 --> 35:35.255
It is moving and working
because they are the same but unique

35:35.280 --> 35:50.230
Same in the sense of height
length and width but they work differently

35:50.230 --> 35:55.280
It's the same in our life

35:55.280 --> 36:07.260
Shri Rama didn't think
only about husband and wife

36:07.260 --> 36:12.950
Didn't think only about children and family

36:12.950 --> 36:21.965
Also of brother, sister, mother, father
and everyone as a normal human being

36:21.965 --> 36:28.515
After he thought about society

36:28.540 --> 36:34.700
About public, state and country

36:34.700 --> 36:46.050
As a human being he has shown
human ideals in his activities

36:46.050 --> 36:56.280
The person who loved his wife so much
knew she was pure and hed left her

36:56.280 --> 37:08.075
Now people give so much to their own wife
but they never give to poor people

37:08.100 --> 37:13.965
Otherwise they give to their relatives
It's a disease among politicians

37:13.965 --> 37:23.735
But the one who has wife who is sakshat
devi had to leave her

37:23.760 --> 37:32.300
We must understand it's attachment
to relatives and possessions

37:32.300 --> 37:39.620
In west marriage relation wasn't alright
but after Sahaja Yoga wife became everything

37:39.645 --> 37:47.508
Here leaders had to leave
because their wives were not alright

37:47.650 --> 37:52.090
Their attention got spoiled
by wife's preaching

37:52.100 --> 37:56.339
At least five yogi left
because of their wives

37:56.805 --> 38:07.830
Wives should understand Sahaja Yoga
and their role in it

38:07.830 --> 38:13.570
In this case husbands shouldn't
agree with their wives at all

38:13.570 --> 38:19.530
Tell her that “You talk and move
too much, Be quiet"

38:19.530 --> 38:22.950
You are useless
Your chakras are not alright

38:22.960 --> 38:28.075
She will be alright only in this way

38:28.075 --> 38:34.380
But instead you blame yourself
and obey your wife?

38:34.405 --> 38:37.475
If she tells you to steal, you do it?

38:37.500 --> 38:45.990
Even after Sahaja Yoga you still
have some catches to take care

38:45.990 --> 38:56.990
On the occasion of Shri Rama
Hanuman should be remembered as his great devotee

38:56.990 --> 39:01.470
And how he was busy at his service

39:01.470 --> 39:13.465
He was aware that his life is
for serving Shri Rama

39:13.465 --> 39:20.645
We should have his awereness in Sahaj Yoga

39:20.670 --> 39:27.410
But it doesn't mean you cook food for
me which I don't eat

39:27.410 --> 39:33.745
You trouble me cooking so much
this and that

39:33.745 --> 39:39.745
Don't keep on serving someone forcefully

39:39.770 --> 39:45.930
What we need is zeal to serve (Sewa)

39:45.940 --> 39:49.425
Hanuman didn't serve food to Shri Rama

39:49.425 --> 39:52.828
Delhi people kept on
serving food so much

39:52.853 --> 39:58.680
that I had to tell them
I wouln't come if you don't stop

39:58.847 --> 40:02.630
Do what you have to do

40:02.630 --> 40:06.892
It's bad to force someone to eat

40:06.892 --> 40:10.515
serving one after another

40:10.540 --> 40:14.580
I don't need anything
and I am tired

40:14.590 --> 40:22.359
I told you only flowers
But don't spend too much also

40:22.445 --> 40:30.045
A lot of flowers make me
worry sometimes

40:30.070 --> 40:38.347
Please your Mother in balance
She is a simple woman who don't understand these

40:38.805 --> 40:46.375
We have to learn that zeal to serve is
from Hanuman ji

40:46.400 --> 40:51.340
There is no special service for me

40:51.365 --> 40:58.455
But if you want to serve me
serve to Sahaj Yoga

41:00.160 --> 41:03.660
Serving to Sahaja Yoga is
serving to me

41:03.660 --> 41:08.240
How many realisation have you given

41:08.265 --> 41:11.764
How many did you transform and inspire

41:11.883 --> 41:18.220
But if you say to new people
they have bhoot, they just leave

41:18.245 --> 41:29.080
One gentleman was told he has
3 bhoots in him so he left Sahaja Yoga

41:29.080 --> 41:33.880
he was told number of bhoots even

41:33.905 --> 41:40.664
he believed it because the Yogi
was an authority in the local area

41:40.821 --> 41:45.180
I don't know who
but the person left

41:45.180 --> 41:51.620
So what we have to learn
from Hanuman is the zeal

41:51.620 --> 41:55.500
" Ram kaj karne ko tatpar"
(eager to do Ram's work)

41:55.500 --> 42:00.040
What is our work?
My work is sahaj yoga

42:00.040 --> 42:04.390
My work is sahaj yoga
To raise kundalini

42:04.400 --> 42:09.133
To make people peaceful and lovable
talking about love

42:09.158 --> 42:22.590
Talk about Sahaja Yoga, about chakras
Make them understand

42:22.600 --> 42:29.800
Doesn't mean you start giving lecture
Some people started to give so much lecture

42:29.800 --> 42:35.460
I had to tell them to stop
Otherwise Sahaja Yoga will be finished

42:35.470 --> 42:43.350
Only long lectures
No time for Mother's talk and Aarti

42:43.360 --> 42:48.265
He said he just can't stop

42:48.265 --> 42:52.595
He doesn't know why
"How can I fix it?"

42:52.595 --> 42:56.085
"You put supari (spice) in your mouth"

42:56.110 --> 43:01.080
Then "How much?"

43:01.080 --> 43:04.940
"It depends on the size of your mouth"

43:04.965 --> 43:10.770
"You don't know it even then
how come you talk aobut Sahaja Yoga"

43:10.770 --> 43:14.270
you don't know it even

43:14.270 --> 43:16.820
People like giving lecture

43:16.830 --> 43:23.440
Get on a stage and won't leave a mic

43:23.440 --> 43:29.420
Once with mic they cant't leave
It's a new disease

43:29.420 --> 43:36.170
So you must understand
why to give lecture

43:36.195 --> 43:45.120
There are so many Mother's talk
you can put a tape or video in every program

43:45.120 --> 43:57.990
After people can write question on paper
And ask them to bring it next program

43:57.990 --> 44:02.290
If there are someone
who is sick or in trouble

44:02.300 --> 44:09.100
Now there is a Yogi
He comes to cure in Calcutta

44:09.100 --> 44:16.550
Now he was called to Russia

44:16.560 --> 44:20.892
One person is running like
Hanuman all over to cure

44:20.917 --> 44:26.277
You all can cure
All women can do

44:26.302 --> 44:29.684
All men also
But nobody tries

44:29.938 --> 44:34.240
By giving lecture how many were cured?

44:34.366 --> 44:35.875
I don't know why only one in India

44:35.875 --> 44:36.375
don't know what's the matter
that till now there is only one man in India
who can cure people

44:40.030 --> 44:47.480
In London there are 15~20 people
who can cure and in France also

44:47.480 --> 44:53.822
One should learn working on people
like giving bandhan

44:53.878 --> 45:04.620
No need to invite someone from abroad
Remove Sahaja Yoga badges if you cannot cure

45:04.620 --> 45:09.595
How do you work on others
if you can't cure even yourself

45:09.620 --> 45:15.635
Everybody has got
all the power to cure anyone

45:15.635 --> 45:19.520
Learn to become masters

45:19.520 --> 45:24.490
Instead of inviting someone
They should go out to cure

45:24.530 --> 45:30.013
Just have some courage to work
Nothing will happen

45:30.212 --> 45:39.832
By working, you become deeper like
a tree grows deeper as it expands

45:40.298 --> 45:48.245
Sahaja Yogis are very much different
from Incarnations

45:48.270 --> 45:53.330
They have never worked in society before

45:53.330 --> 45:57.760
Nobody had the power for a mass

45:57.785 --> 46:03.645
Only one to one
Like King Janaka to Nachiketa

46:03.660 --> 46:12.905
But now you all have it
Just grow it, that's all

46:12.905 --> 46:19.790
Cure yourself and others
Understand Sahaja Yoga, you have everything

46:19.845 --> 46:25.510
But still your attention is wondering
What are you running after?

46:25.510 --> 46:32.158
You still don't understand it
Sahaja Yoga is just blessing

46:32.238 --> 46:36.510
You won't be in short of anything

46:36.535 --> 46:41.910
Just work for sahaja Yoga
Even if you don't work you will be blessed

46:41.910 --> 46:48.040
Business or promotion,
this and that

46:48.065 --> 46:54.883
Everyone is blessed and
nothing to give up

46:54.908 --> 47:00.563
Otherwise in time of freedom fight

47:00.750 --> 47:06.806
we were tortured
Lied on ice, got electric shocks

47:06.845 --> 47:11.335
My parents went to jail
Our house was sold

47:11.335 --> 47:19.100
Lived in a hut... had to sacrifice a lot
And you don't have to do it

47:19.100 --> 47:24.070
But not only recieving
You have to give

47:24.076 --> 47:31.408
If one door is open so should be the other one
Only one doesn't work

47:31.427 --> 47:38.136
Everyone reports me
about blessings they got

47:39.375 --> 47:46.330
We must see what we have done for others

47:46.380 --> 47:58.840
But there are many fights for leadership
It's all mother's play

47:58.850 --> 48:02.990
You will know it when you will fall from there

48:02.990 --> 48:09.719
Specially women shouldn't get involved
They fall very soon

48:09.744 --> 48:14.710
And men should know
there is nothing like ministers

48:14.789 --> 48:18.345
This is Mother's play
Don't get involved in

48:18.345 --> 48:26.357
Why I call a leader? It's a play
There are no leaders

48:26.444 --> 48:35.100
It's just a test if you have ego
If you have, you are gone

48:35.100 --> 48:41.870
It will be shown immediately
In Sahaja Yoga everything gets exposed

48:41.902 --> 48:46.773
Even if I say something
it shows on the faces

48:46.789 --> 48:54.512
Once some leaders came and
confessed their mistakes

48:54.568 --> 49:04.180
They have more responsibilities to be
better, sweet, humble and loving

49:04.180 --> 49:08.570
and become close and sharing with everyone

49:08.570 --> 49:17.640
Now on the auspicious occasion of Shri Rama
we must understand what he had showen

49:17.665 --> 49:23.592
Only a bit of it would please our Mother

49:23.630 --> 49:34.765
He was in exile for a long time in Jungle
Walked barefeet, worked so hard

49:34.765 --> 49:38.715
Just to obey his father

49:38.715 --> 49:42.725
Now to obey me
you don't need to go into exile

49:42.725 --> 49:48.010
Not barefeet, nor starving nothing
All are there for you

49:48.126 --> 49:54.610
But you must know how to cure people
in Sahaja Yoga

49:54.610 --> 49:58.090
everything about sahaj yoga

49:58.117 --> 50:02.775
and mostly about love

50:02.800 --> 50:10.560
it's nothing but power of love
Everybody will be benefited

50:10.560 --> 50:17.090
This is not only for special people

50:17.100 --> 50:24.303
This is not only for one country
but for the whole world

50:24.765 --> 50:33.610
Watch how your attention is
If it's disturbed we should correct it

50:33.687 --> 50:40.800
Put the power of spirit in it
Do everything with concentration

50:40.904 --> 50:47.443
And devotion and love will
make you deep

50:47.443 --> 50:54.333
Otherwise there is lots of rubbish

50:54.358 --> 51:02.259
If you wish to stay like rubbish
you know where it goes at the end

51:02.346 --> 51:07.090
If you want to feel you are
specially good capable of anything

51:07.305 --> 51:13.289
First humility, not only towards me
but everyone

51:13.456 --> 51:26.168
Talk humbly with love and show that
people can blossom like lotus in Sahaja Yoga

51:26.271 --> 51:28.765
to spread fragrance everywhere

51:28.765 --> 51:37.370
People will tell me you are wonderful
if you will do it in that way

51:37.370 --> 51:42.491
One day you too will be called as
Maryada Purushottama

51:42.571 --> 51:48.552
You are the temple of Rama
so have it within yourself

51:48.600 --> 51:54.639
Perform puja to it
Take care of your self-esteem

51:55.171 --> 52:04.128
Take the benefit of self-realization
inside yourself

52:04.175 --> 52:08.760
You must have respect and devotion to it

52:08.760 --> 52:17.058
"Now we are realized"
"How can we do wrong, we are yogi"

52:17.130 --> 52:23.750
Soon you will have blessings
immediately

52:23.750 --> 52:29.888
As I am called Rokra devi, you will get
blessing as soon as you assert it

52:30.134 --> 52:39.540
Everyone is getting blessed with it
give it back to the world

52:39.565 --> 52:53.275
Shri Rama used all his powers for the
benevolence of people to show the ideal

52:53.275 --> 53:01.175
You will be surprised to achieve so high
when the time comes

53:01.185 --> 53:09.195
You won't have any disease and
all bad habits will be dropped

53:09.220 --> 53:17.405
You will eat, talk and watch
as much as you need

53:17.453 --> 53:29.782
You will watch your mind
for introspection

53:29.814 --> 53:40.568
"Where is my mind going?"
"I'm a Sahaja Yogi, stop it"

53:41.488 --> 53:45.366
By doing so
you will be in meditation

53:45.391 --> 53:51.723
Your kundalini will be satisfied
and give you blessings

53:51.748 --> 53:54.728
You say,
"Mother what a blessing"

53:54.900 --> 53:59.603
But you have to jump into it
Only then will you know it

53:59.738 --> 54:04.075
Till then you need to work hard

54:04.075 --> 54:10.155
Shri Rama was born
at midnight so let's have puja late

54:10.180 --> 54:17.242
Shri Rama Puja is not
a specially long one

54:17.423 --> 54:29.154
As he is in a human form
he is humanity within us

54:29.406 --> 54:41.915
by which we understand our intellect
and our thoughts get changed

54:41.940 --> 54:49.210
Shri Rama is that
Through him we can change our thoughts

54:49.210 --> 54:55.380
Our nature can change
Because he is our ideal

54:55.380 --> 55:02.801
After achieving his ideals we reach another
because he was human ideal

55:02.850 --> 55:09.030
It is great that God came to this world
in a human form to became our ideal

55:09.061 --> 55:18.835
He has gone through all the hardships
to show us strength to keep Dharma

55:18.860 --> 55:23.543
That is Vishwa Dharma
and the state of yoga

55:24.154 --> 55:28.170
May God bless you all
