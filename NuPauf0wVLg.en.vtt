00:00:07.184 --> 00:00:13.554
So, today actually with all this
theme that I am talking about,

00:00:13.634 --> 00:00:23.167
about collectivity, which is
the blessing of Shri Krishna.

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:35.367
And that His essence was
madhurya, is the sweetness.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:44.521
And Radha who was His energy

00:00:44.601 --> 00:00:46.987
was known for Ahlada (आह्लाद) Dayini.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:51.120
‘Ahlada Dayini’ means the one who is joy giving.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:01:00.434
Ahlada is even more than joy.

00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:09.888
Sorry but, you see, joy can be a very general word

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:19.234
but ‘Ahlada’ means a bubbling of joy.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.287
When you see somebody, the bubbling of joy,

00:01:25.367 --> 00:01:28.053
that is Her power.

00:01:28.133 --> 00:01:31.320
And She was the Power of Shri Krishna.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:36.120
So, when you meet a friend, you know, how you feel

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.434
like just taking him to your heart,

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:47.888
just embracing. And you
don’t know what to do with that.

00:01:47.968 --> 00:01:51.567
And sometimes it’s so much
that you feel like beating.

00:01:53.834 --> 00:01:56.521
Beating yourself or beating the friend.

00:01:56.601 --> 00:02:01.400
That sort of a joy is 
Ahlada Dayini: that is Radha.

00:02:02.267 --> 00:02:11.754
So, today let us now – the power of
joy, we have to worship the power of joy

00:02:11.834 --> 00:02:17.920
and this power of joy which is Ahlada Dayini.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.654
Of course we do the same way

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:25.187
but with the idea that: now we are praying

00:02:25.267 --> 00:02:31.287
that our heart should open by Shiva.

00:02:31.367 --> 00:02:33.920
And once our heart is open,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:43.267
it will be expressed by the power
of Shri Radha and Shri Krishna.

00:02:44.601 --> 00:02:46.721
This is the combination today.

00:02:46.801 --> 00:02:53.387
Let us have this way, that it’s
a combination of heart opening,

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:57.033
[and] through Vishuddhi we are expressing it.

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:01.454
Like some people, especially women

00:03:01.534 --> 00:03:06.187
when they are over-joyous
they start weeping and crying:

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:08.834
so that’s Ahlada.
