00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:08.839
Now how do you do it in Sahaja Yoga?

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.923
As you have the photograph you may use it.

00:00:12.965 --> 00:00:14.840
Put a light before the photograph.

00:00:14.881 --> 00:00:17.131
Light is the way you cure your Agnya Chakra.

00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.507
Always. Light or the sun. Because Christ resides in the sun.

00:00:21.507 --> 00:00:25.173
So what you do, is to put a light in front.

00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:31.298
Take another light behind and give an Aarti to your Agnya Chakra

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:40.090
at the back. It is resided by Maha Ganapati and Maha Bhairava.

00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:44.923
So you just give it an Aarti and Agnya Chakra will open.

00:00:44.965 --> 00:00:48.965
But how do you open this ? Very simple thing is that,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.590
any thought comes to you, you should say 'I forgive'.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.632
This is the greatest weapon Christ has given us.

00:00:54.674 --> 00:00:56.674
You just say 'I forgive, I forgive',

00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:59.048
and you can overcome your ego.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.340
This is the mantra for this Chakra in the front,

00:01:02.382 --> 00:01:05.340
where you just say 'I forgive, I forgive, I forgive'

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.839
and you will find your Agnya Chakra will open out

00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:10.230
and you will find your ego will go away.

00:01:10.311 --> 00:01:13.965
Forgiveness is one of the 'biggest' weapons human beings have got.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:16.923
But they are so stupid if I tell them 'Forgive.

00:01:16.965 --> 00:01:21.287
Now what is there not to forgive ?'
They say it is very difficult to forgive.

00:01:21.368 --> 00:01:23.967
I say what is so difficult ? What are you doing ?

00:01:24.048 --> 00:01:26.090
Are you doing something when you are saying,

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.757
I am forgiving. Do you do something ? Nothing.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.757
On the contrary when you do not forgive,

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:35.340
then what is happening is, the person whom you do not forgive,

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.382
is actually torturing you, while you are not torturing that person.

00:01:39.423 --> 00:01:44.173
So this is the mantra of the Agnya Chakra in front,

00:01:44.173 --> 00:01:47.590
and at the back, as I told you, you have to move the Light.

00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:50.131
Now somebody will, you see, one day they will do,

00:01:50.173 --> 00:01:53.686
two days they will do, - that is not how the Sahaja yoga is to be worked out.

00:01:53.767 --> 00:01:55.560
You have to really go all out to do it,

00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:58.923
and I have seen people who had eyes which were all bent like this,

00:01:58.923 --> 00:02:01.340
they could never raise their eyes, are now,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.799
have open eyes, proper eyes with this working.

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:07.006
It is 'very' simple to be done.

00:02:07.048 --> 00:02:09.507
There is one more thing that happens to our eyes.

00:02:09.507 --> 00:02:13.632
When the Swadishthana Chakra goes out of order.

00:02:13.632 --> 00:02:16.632
It is represented here at the back,

00:02:16.674 --> 00:02:20.632
which is 'around' this back Agnya.

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:23.507
So when you have diabetes or anything like that,

00:02:23.507 --> 00:02:28.131
people start becoming blind. Because this Swadishthana Chakra

00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:32.048
which is around, goes on pressing it and that is how,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:40.340
that part which is surrounding this center, oppresses

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:47.090
and augments that centre, so that the eyes cannot see;

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.340
there is no light. There is darkness and people have eyes open.

00:02:50.382 --> 00:02:54.006
You have seen many diabetic people get this blindness.

00:02:54.048 --> 00:02:59.590
So first of all cure your diabetes through curing your Swadishthana.

00:02:59.632 --> 00:03:11.257
And also you can use an ice around your Swadishthana at the back.

00:03:11.257 --> 00:03:15.131
But first of all if you improve your Swadishthana

00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.131
you will feel very much better.

00:03:17.173 --> 00:03:23.048
So the treatment of the front side is with the light.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.048
And the treatment of the back is with the water.

00:03:28.048 --> 00:03:32.923
But the best is also to use the light or the water

00:03:32.965 --> 00:03:35.715
whichever way you like. Because if it is Swadishthana

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:40.507
you have to use the water but if it is 'just' the possession,

00:03:40.507 --> 00:03:44.298
then you have to use - without diabetes, if it is a possession --

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.507
then you have to just use the light.

00:03:46.507 --> 00:03:50.298
That is how we cure our Agnya Chakra.
