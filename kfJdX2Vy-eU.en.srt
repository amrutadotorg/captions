1
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,040
According to the calendar,

2
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:46,800
this year there are ten days of Navaratri,

3
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,000
not of nine.

4
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:54,040
Nine are the days,

5
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,760
in the night,

6
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,040
when the Goddess had to fight the demons

7
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:12,280
and to save Her children from the effects of negativity.

8
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:18,520
On one side,

9
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:23,200
She was ocean of love and compassion,

10
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,240
and on the other side,

11
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,400
She was protecting them like a tigress.

12
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,800
Because the times

13
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,240
were such that nobody could meditate,

14
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:45,360
nobody could take the name of God,

15
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,920
nobody could think even of self-realization.

16
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,360
But those who are sitting here today,

17
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,560
you have been there also in those days,

18
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:05,080
and you were all saved for today, for this day,

19
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,600
so that you can achieve your Self Realization.

20
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,320
The form of the Goddess in those days

21
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,840
was not Maya Swarupi.

22
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:21,680
She was in Her real form,

23
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,040
and that created a great awe,

24
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,480
even among the disciples.

25
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,320
So the question of giving them

26
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,080
Self Realization was not there.

27
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,160
First of all, they were to be saved.

28
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,640
So like nine months the mother has to keep the child

29
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,200
in her womb, for these nine months,

30
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:50,080
or you can say nine yugas, nine times,

31
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,480
you all have been saved properly,

32
00:03:52,720 --> 00:04:01,600
and on the tenth month you are given your birth.

33
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:07,600
Also this birth is always after seven days of nine months.

34
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:09,880
So we had to wait

35
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,840
for some time till it matures.

36
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,120
Now the tenth Navaratri today

37
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,320
is to celebrate actually the Adi Shakti.

38
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,360
So today we are really going to worship the Adi Shakti.

39
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,680
On one side the Adi Shakti is Mahakali,

40
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,600
on the other side, She is Mahasaraswati,

41
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,280
in the center She is Mahalakshmi,

42
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,640
and also She is the Amba,

43
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:45,880
the One Who is the Kundalini.

44
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:50,240
But She is also beyond that.

45
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,080
She's parashakti;

46
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,200
She's beyond all the powers.

47
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,520
Because She is the generator of power.

48
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,600
So, She has to be beyond all that.

49
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,400
So today when we are worshipping Her,

50
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,560
we have to worship Her in all these forms.

51
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,080
So you understand that the tenth day

52
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,400
that we are having Navaratri for the first time

53
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,040
in the calendar is because

54
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:23,960
today is the day when we are worshipping Adi Shakti.

55
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,040
Adi Shakti was never worshipped before, never.

56
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,160
But, this time, when I went to Calcutta,

57
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,080
I told them that "You better worship Adi Shakti today."

58
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,160
And they were surprised,

59
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:42,440
"Why today Mother is asking

60
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,240
for Adi Shakti to be worshipped?"

61
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520
So when I went back to Poona,

62
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,600
they told Me that Adi Shakti, as you know,

63
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,720
is the Saptashringi,

64
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,480
means the One with seven peaks.

65
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,480
She rests on the seven peaks,

66
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:06,440
means on the Sahasrara, on the seven, seven chakras.

67
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,440
She rules all the seven chakras.

68
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,600
They told me that when we had the puja in Calcutta,

69
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,000
same time, that's the only time

70
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,080
when those who follow Saptashringi,

71
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,240
which are very few people, all of them come there,

72
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,920
and there they come, first of all

73
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,120
the people from Her mother's side come down.

74
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:40,080
So the mother's side of the Adi Shakti

75
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,200
are regarded as Vaishnavites, the one who follow Vishnu.

76
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:48,080
So they come first there to worship Her,

77
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:50,320
and then the father-in-law's side,

78
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:54,360
that is Shiva's side, comes in, Sadashiva's side.

79
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,480
That's exactly that time when we had the puja.

80
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,200
They have these two groups together to worship.

81
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,160
So now we have among ourselves people of two types.

82
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,160
One are, we can call the one who worship Brahmadeva

83
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,080
on the right hand side,

84
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:18,520
and the people who worship Shiva on the left hand side.

85
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,120
Both sides have to meet at a point,

86
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,240
and that point has come,

87
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,280
that we have to worship

88
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:34,480
the complete integrated form of all these powers,

89
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,320
which has manifested within us.

90
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,640
Now when they say there is only one God,

91
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,520
all right there is one God.

92
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,800
But one God has got a head,

93
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,120
He's got His liver,

94
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,240
He's got His stomach,

95
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,880
He's got His nose.

96
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,520
He's got everything.

97
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,480
Just like as human beings are.

98
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,120
Because they say so,

99
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:00,080
that God made human beings in their own image.

100
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,760
So then He has different parts in the bodies,

101
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,440
and He has to run those different parts.

102
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,360
And for these different parts,

103
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,200
He has to have Deities,

104
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,480
and these Deities are to be understood.

105
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,200
And unless und until you understand

106
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,920
and worship those Deities,

107
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,560
you cannot awaken those Deities within yourself.

108
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,880
But they all are part and parcel of the Adi Shakti.

109
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,400
Are completely under the control of the Adi Shakti.

110
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,880
Yesterday you heard about the powers of the Adi Shakti.

111
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,040
It's like

112
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:45,960
a tortoise takes his whole body inside his shell,

113
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,880
in the same way

114
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,040
I have withdrawn all these powers within Myself.

115
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,080
I mean, you cannot discover them easily.

116
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,480
You cannot find them out easily.

117
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,160
Except for these modern cameras,

118
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,560
which are trying to cheat us.

119
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,800
They are the ones who are giving My forms and things to you.

120
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,600
Because there is light

121
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,840
in these vibrations,

122
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,800
and when these vibrations are emitted,

123
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:29,920
you start seeing them in these cameras,

124
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,440
even if they may not be very sensitive,

125
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,560
but somehow people catch it.

126
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,160
There have been so many miraculous photographs, as you know.

127
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,880
One photograph you must have seen

128
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,200
where Shri Ganesha Himself is standing behind Me.

129
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,560
Now you don't see anyone standing just now here.

130
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,480
But you don't know what's happening.

131
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,840
And this is what one has to understand,

132
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:06,200
That we have entered into a new realm of God's magic.

133
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,400
And His magic works, in so many ways.

134
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:18,120
Of course, sometimes, you also get lost.

135
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:26,120
Because of your previous problems you get dragged down.

136
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,920
You get tempted.

137
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:36,360
Sometimes you get also dominated

138
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:41,520
by negative forces and you fall down.

139
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,080
And this is a very sad thing

140
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:49,320
that should happen to any Sahaja Yogi.

141
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:53,080
Because perhaps you do not know your past,

142
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:57,200
and you do not know how you have struggled,

143
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:03,160
how you have worked hard to come up to this level.

144
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,840
And after coming to this level,

145
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,400
if you do not try to go higher,

146
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,560
then

147
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,480
either you'll be stuck on the same place,

148
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,760
or maybe that you may be thrown down.

149
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:28,800
So for you to know that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

150
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,520
you are not a wife, husband, mother, father,

151
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,840
you are a Sahaja Yogi.

152
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,960
Like I'm the Adi Shakti,

153
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,440
like that you are Sahaja Yogis.

154
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:46,000
So "My main job now is to give realization to others.

155
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,120
And because all My relationships are already fixed properly,

156
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:56,080
I don't have to worry about any Deity, about any God,

157
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,160
They all work out very efficiently, everything."

158
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,720
Now the description yesterday as you read of the Goddess,

159
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,360
that Her hands were throwing

160
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,080
all the arrows with such a speed that

161
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:13,160
as if one felt that She was dancing.

162
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,600
Is a fact, no doubt,

163
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,880
but you don't see that.

164
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:25,080
You cannot see that every hair of Mine is like an arrow.

165
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,240
And it works so tremendously.

166
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,640
But to you I'm just sitting here quietly,

167
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,520
just like you as you are sitting.

168
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,000
But it's not so.

169
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,200
It's something much more.

170
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,120
Now when they show a lion or a tiger,

171
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,800
as My vahana,

172
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,320
then you have to understand that they show,

173
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,120
actually they are.

174
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,960
Actually they are.

175
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:01,040
It's not that they are symbolically, actually they are.

176
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,160
So the dignity of a tiger,

177
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:07,040
I have told you many a times how dignified it is.

178
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,360
Because I sit on him, he's so dignified.

179
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:15,600
If he has to eat the meat, he'll kill one cow or anything,

180
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:18,400
eat the meat, leave it for others.

181
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:20,800
It's so dignified.

182
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,640
And once a month he eats.

183
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:30,480
So even to get a vahana of this kind,

184
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,640
this was to be evolved from amoeba stage to this stage.

185
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,680
Otherwise he would not have been here.

186
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,360
In the same way you are evolved,

187
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:47,520
and in you are these, all these vahanas also there.

188
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,480
And they work out

189
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:54,560
very quickly all that you want.

190
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,360
You desire something;

191
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,160
you'll be surprised immediately you'll find it works out.

192
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,320
You ask for something, immediately it works out.

193
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:13,080
But there should be a complete dedication in Sahaja Yoga.

194
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,040
When I say Sahaj Yog,

195
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:21,520
you know that is the yoga of your attention with My Feet.

196
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,880
That's what it is.

197
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,520
But if you are still moving with your egos

198
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,160
and if you are still thinking on those lines

199
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:41,320
that "We are something and we can start our own Sahaj Yog,

200
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,560
we can work out this way and that way,"

201
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,320
or "My wife is like that, my child is like that,

202
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:48,360
my husband is like that."

203
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,400
You have to give up all these problems on one side.

204
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:57,240
Otherwise, you will not ascend.

205
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,320
It was not difficult for Me to give you Realization,

206
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:03,720
because you were just ready for that.

207
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,000
But to keep your light on, you have to work hard.

208
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,000
Now tiger remains at its own position.

209
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,800
He doesn't change.

210
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:15,600
Lion remains at his own position,

211
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:18,080
and they are all available, all the time,

212
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:19,760
in their own position.

213
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,920
All the Devatas and Gods are in Their own positions

214
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,280
with Their own qualities, They are there.

215
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:31,400
Nowhere, none of these Gods have described that

216
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,440
They give you moksha. Except for the Goddess.

217
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,280
She's the only One who gives you Realization.

218
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:43,600
Because She's in charge of all the seven chakras.

219
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,320
She holds all these seven chakras,

220
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,400
and on these seven chakras She can work it out.

221
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,560
So there's a big history,

222
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:01,800
evolution of all those things even in the Virata's body,

223
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:04,560
and also in you people.

224
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:07,560
So you have to cope with it.

225
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:09,800
If you cannot cope with it,

226
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,480
then it won't work out.

227
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Now the problems we have, in the West, as you know,

228
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,880
are stupid problems

229
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,080
which are not suitable to any Sahaja Yogi.

230
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,560
Attachment.

231
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:31,960
First they were not attached to their wives

232
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,200
or to their children, now they're attached like glue.

233
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,040
I do not say you give up your children or your wife,

234
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:48,280
but your attachment should be with Sahaja Yoga.

235
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,720
Once the blessings of Sahaja Yoga comes to you,

236
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,160
they will flow to your children,

237
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,760
to your wife, to everyone, to your country,

238
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,000
to the whole world.

239
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,720
Now supposing this is the attachment,

240
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:06,280
a very simple electrical thing.

241
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:10,360
So if its attachment is not to the mains,

242
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,240
and anywhere else, what's the use?

243
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:16,560
It cannot give electricity to anybody else.

244
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,240
Is a simple logic,

245
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,280
that you should be attached to the source of energy first.

246
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,520
Simple logic.

247
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,040
And then, that energy can flow to others.

248
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,520
If you yourself you are not attached

249
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,400
to that source of energy,

250
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:41,560
how can that power flow anywhere?

251
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,160
It's a simple thing we do not understand in Sahaja Yoga.

252
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,120
And so our attachments

253
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,920
start getting rusted and we don't understand

254
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
what has happened to us.

255
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:03,960
You are not attached to the main source!

256
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,440
And that's the only attachment you need.

257
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:16,240
And then the whole thing will flow to the other end.

258
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:21,240
So, we have these kinds of attachments.

259
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:28,520
Then we are attached to so many miserable things we like,

260
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,120
which make us miserable.

261
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,120
For example, we are attached, to say,

262
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:49,240
some sort of a stupid entrepreneur fashion.

263
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:52,440
We're attached to it.

264
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,920
Whether it is in Sahaj culture or not,

265
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,920
we are attached to it.

266
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:08,120
And all these attachments are not to the source,

267
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,960
to the source of joy,

268
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,520
to the source of knowledge,

269
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,800
to the source of energy which ascends you.

270
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,680
This is the reason why

271
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,640
our situation

272
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,240
of collective ascent is poor.

273
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:44,560
Now the Adi Shakti's work is to give you Realization first,

274
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:51,600
second is to give you life,

275
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,360
to comfort you.

276
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:58,120
If you have physical problems,

277
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,040
She will look after you.

278
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,240
She'll go all out.

279
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,440
If you've mental problem,

280
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,560
She will try to solve.

281
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,160
So, She's a comforter;

282
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,840
She gives you the comfort.

283
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:14,280
At the same time, She protects you.

284
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,600
I've seen many people, even now,

285
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,000
get frightened very soon,

286
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,200
at the slightest thing.

287
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:25,240
Why should you be frightened?

288
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,760
There's a tiger standing.

289
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:32,960
You can't see him, may be today he might be in the picture.

290
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:39,080
And your Mother is so powerful.

291
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,880
You have to understand how powerful She is.

292
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,360
This is, the understanding is not in your heads.

293
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:47,120
Sometimes your wives are more powerful

294
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:49,920
or your children are more powerful.

295
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,000
When you know that your Mother is so powerful

296
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,200
- She's your Mother.

297
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,520
Then you should be absolutely secured.

298
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,880
And then things work out.

299
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,520
I'll give you an example of one gentleman

300
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,960
whom I met in Madras

301
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,720
once, not many years back,

302
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,520
about I think two, three years back or so.

303
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,600
He was such a seeker, immediately he recognized Me.

304
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,640
And then he went down to Bombay, posting was there,

305
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,240
and he received a letter saying that his mother

306
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,240
on death bed. So he went down.

307
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,440
The doctor said that "She has a galloping cancer

308
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:36,480
and she's going to die in no time."

309
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:38,920
He knows, "My Mother is Adi Shakti."

310
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,880
Just took My photograph, sat before Me,

311
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,800
said, "Mother, I've nothing to say,

312
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,760
whatever You think proper for my mother, please do that."

313
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,960
Just he said so. He's connected.

314
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,320
They said three days after, "She's going to die."

315
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:55,360
Three days after she got out of the hospital.

316
00:21:55,600 --> 00:22:00,560
He took him down to Bombay, showed him in a hospital,

317
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,720
in cancer hospital.

318
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,920
They said, "She has no cancer, nothing,

319
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,320
she's completely cured."

320
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:15,480
If the energy is not allowed to flow,

321
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,080
you are still worried about your wife,

322
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,240
you're worried about your house,

323
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,160
you're worried about your children,

324
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,440
you're worried about this,

325
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,280
about "my children, my house, my wife"

326
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:30,600
this "my" when it drops,

327
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,400
then I can work.

328
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,120
But it should not be taken

329
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,360
that I'm saying you become ascetics, no way.

330
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,600
No saints were ascetics,

331
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,760
they all had wives, they all had children.

332
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,400
But all their attention was at the Lotus Feet of the Mother.

333
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,440
As Guru Nanaka has said

334
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,440
that a little boy is playing with his kite,

335
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,520
the kite is going all over,

336
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,800
and he is talking to his friends, joking, this thing,

337
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:09,960
but his attention is on the kite.

338
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,280
There's a lady who is cleaning her house

339
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,600
with a little child on her waist,

340
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:20,320
and she's cleaning the house and grooming it.

341
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:24,440
She's doing everything, but her attention is on her child.

342
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,160
Then there are ladies in India, as you know,

343
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,160
they have three, four pitchers filled water

344
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,160
and they walk with both the hands like this.

345
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,960
They know how to balance it.

346
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:37,960
They're talking to each other, laughing, making fun,

347
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:43,200
pulling legs. But the attention is on the pitchers.

348
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:51,000
My attention is always on your Kundalini.

349
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:56,920
You cannot play tricks in Sahaja Yog, take it from Me.

350
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:00,120
Anybody who tries to play any trick

351
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,720
will be very badly punished.

352
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,960
So please be very, very careful not to be dishonest,

353
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:10,480
and not to play tricks in Sahaja Yoga.

354
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,760
I won't do anything, but here they are!

355
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,520
You see already, with all his teeth.

356
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:25,320
They're all fixed quantities, I have told them.

357
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,800
They're are fixed quantities.

358
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,680
They know what to do, and they will do it.

359
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:36,560
So there is no need to play any tricks in Sahaja Yoga.

360
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:41,000
This is another mistake of Sahaja Yogis,

361
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:43,200
that they think they can play tricks with Me

362
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,560
or with Sahaja Yoga.

363
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,920
When those things come into your head,

364
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:54,080
I would say these are demonic ideas,

365
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,360
because they will destroy you completely.

366
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:01,080
On one side Sahaja Yoga is a blessing,

367
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,360
absolutely blessing on the ascent you go ahead like that.

368
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,480
You go to a height,

369
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:11,200
but you must know also, you've reached the height;

370
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:13,560
you have to be very careful to be there.

371
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,080
Because once you fall from that height,

372
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,440
how deep you'll go?

373
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:24,360
Is logical again to see that you'll fall very low.

374
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,080
So here you are having the blessings,

375
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:36,040
all the beauties, all the love, all the joy,

376
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:43,000
all the knowledge, all the friends, all the care.

377
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:49,760
And there, if you don't want to be here,

378
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,600
just because you are playing tricks,

379
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:56,800
you want to be here and play tricks, that is not possible.

380
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:59,000
That doesn't work out,

381
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,800
you are immediately thrown out,

382
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,480
and once you are thrown out, God knows where you'll go.

383
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,760
That's not our lookout.

384
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,320
But you are thrown out by these.

385
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:18,320
So one has to know that the Deities are extremely alert.

386
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:27,320
And They're watching all of you.

387
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,200
Because They have to guard you,

388
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,240
They have to look after you,

389
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,360
They have to help you,

390
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,240
They have to do everything for you.

391
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,480
They have to work out everything for you.

392
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:38,280
They are the Ones who create flowers for you;

393
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,440
They're doing all kinds of good things for you.

394
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,480
But, at the same time,

395
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:48,920
They are only attached to Me,

396
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:51,960
all of Them,

397
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,800
not to you.

398
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:57,600
Because you are My children,

399
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,600
They are looking after you.

400
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,680
Once you try to misbehave,

401
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,600
you are finished and you go down.

402
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,440
But the compassion of your Mother is so great,

403
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:19,920
that She always tries to forgive,

404
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:26,080
give chances and tells those Deities to keep quiet.

405
00:27:26,280 --> 00:27:30,240
Of course They obey - up to a point.

406
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,280
But if you want to be nasty people,

407
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,240
if you want to be cruel,

408
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:42,200
if you want to be sinful

409
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,240
and stay in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot.

410
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:48,240
It's not like any religion as you saw yesterday

411
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,360
that you commit any mistakes,

412
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,760
do what you like, kill anyone, cheat anyone,

413
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:56,240
and still be there.

414
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,920
It's not like that.

415
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:07,440
Here you have to be Sahaja Yogi

416
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:10,560
in the real sense of the word.

417
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,760
And this is why one has to understand.

418
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,240
There are some Sahaja Yogis have come, they can't get in,

419
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,560
I think the doors are closed.

420
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:35,960
So, now such a tremendous Power,

421
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,200
so alert, so affectionate,

422
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,880
so kind

423
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,680
is there.

424
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:54,160
And a Mother, Who is your teacher.

425
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,400
Mother teaches children with love.

426
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,720
Not only that,

427
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:03,960
but you never even felt how I taught you Sahaja Yoga.

428
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,360
You just learnt it like that.

429
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,680
It's a child's play for you.

430
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,520
It's such a difficult and subtle subject;

431
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:15,520
you picked it up without any difficulties.

432
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,400
So artfully it was done,

433
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,240
beautifully it was done,

434
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,400
built in within you, now you know this is Sahaja Yog,

435
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,640
this is not Sahaj Yoga.

436
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,400
All this knowledge came to you so sweetly.

437
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,040
The way you sing Indian musics, you see,

438
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,200
even the Indians are surprised,

439
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,200
they can't sing like you sometimes.

440
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,720
Those who had come to My program, they saw you.

441
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,080
Some musicians, they said,

442
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,680
"We were really ashamed.

443
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:45,320
How could these people sing so well?

444
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:50,560
And pronounce everything so well?"

445
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,520
And you have to trust this Power fully!

446
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,400
Those days, when people were in difficulties,

447
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,480
they were always attacked,

448
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,600
they had not got their Self Realization,

449
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:12,520
they had to put their trust into the Divine Power.

450
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,920
They had to put.

451
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,240
But now when you have got Realization,

452
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,360
you have got your freedom.

453
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,200
Should never forget that you have to trust

454
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:29,520
this Divine Power.

455
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,600
All the time that It will look after you.

456
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:40,320
Now, how do we play tricks in Sahaja Yoga?

457
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,200
Some lazy lumps come into Sahaja Yoga.

458
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,920
Absolute lazy lumps, means they must be left-sided

459
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,440
or whatever it is.

460
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,360
And if you tell them,
"You better do this work."

461
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,440
"No Mother, I won't do this work,

462
00:30:56,640 --> 00:30:58,680
because my right side will come up."

463
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,880
Very common trick.

464
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,520
Is a very common trick,

465
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,520
"I can't do this work!"

466
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,920
When it comes to work, they'll just run away.

467
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:15,720
How many people work?

468
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,320
Very few.

469
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,360
The other day I went to the kitchen,

470
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,520
and I asked this Indian girls what's happening,

471
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,720
they said, "They are all running away.

472
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:26,360
Nobody's here to help us."

473
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,400
Nobody wants to take responsibility.

474
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,120
But the trick is that it is played on Sahaja Yoga,

475
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:39,320
that "If I do this thing I will become right-sided."

476
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,040
But if you become left-sided,

477
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,280
this one is there.

478
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,560
Is very nice you have put him here, I am very happy.

479
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,320
So, all lethargic people, lazy lumps,

480
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:02,160
always do that.

481
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:04,400
Now, somebody is told that

482
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
"You have to get up in the morning."

483
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,200
They feel terrible about it,

484
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,000
"Oh! How to get up?"

485
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,120
But if you go back into your own background,

486
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,120
you'll say you must have taken drugs,

487
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,120
you must have taken alcohols,

488
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,040
you must have taken all these left-sided things,

489
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,600
that's why you cannot get up in the morning!

490
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,800
Now, how will you

491
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,960
finish or neutralize those bad habits that you had?

492
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,240
How will you do it?

493
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,920
If you start getting up early in the morning,

494
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,240
slowly the habit will be formed,

495
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,440
and you can get rid of it.

496
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:49,000
It's just to make yourselves available

497
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:52,360
when the morning sun is about to come.

498
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:59,320
Alcohol itself is such a left-sided nonsense.

499
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,280
So much so that once the Goddess drank

500
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,440
all the alcohols of the world.

501
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,200
You won't believe, all the alcohols!

502
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:19,520
Saints like Sainath smoked all the tobacco of Maharastra,

503
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:22,640
but still they are smoking.

504
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,080
Like Shiva drank the whole of the poison

505
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,840
because He is the giver of life.

506
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,280
Whatever They have worked so much,

507
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,560
so sincerely,

508
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:43,720
earnestly with complete concentration.

509
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,160
You see Me working like that,

510
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:49,320
but They have also worked the same way.

511
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:54,760
So don't take things for granted!

512
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,240
I have told many of you to write down,

513
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,480
what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

514
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:08,400
For myself I'll do everything - I'll paint my house,

515
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:14,600
I'll paint my kitchen, everything,

516
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:18,800
I'll have a nice sari done up, blouse done up.

517
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,640
Myself.

518
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,880
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?

519
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:29,440
How many presents I have given to others?

520
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:34,560
How many letters I've written to others?

521
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,160
What experiences I have written down?

522
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,560
Above all,

523
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:45,680
how many times I have felt the love of my Mother in my heart?

524
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,200
But I'll tell you the reason in the West

525
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,320
why the big problem is, I've discovered it now.

526
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,160
As I discovered Sahaja Yoga,

527
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,320
also I've discovered the secret

528
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,440
which I am telling you today.

529
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:12,600
This is also the Shakti of penetration

530
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:22,320
that one can find out the demons,

531
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,040
how they work in our minds,

532
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,440
how they prosper.

533
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,360
I think I've told some people,

534
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,600
but I am going to tell you all.

535
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,440
When we are children,

536
00:35:36,760 --> 00:35:39,600
till the age of five years,

537
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,080
we are ego-oriented

538
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:46,160
in the sense that we are just looking after ourselves.

539
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,600
You give ten toys to ten children,

540
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,080
they'll take their toys and play with each other,

541
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:55,280
don't talk to anyone, they'll just go and play.

542
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,600
They'll not disturb another one,

543
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,200
it's all parallel living.

544
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,320
They won't disturb.

545
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,120
If they disturb, they might beat,

546
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,160
they might do something else nonsensical.

547
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,440
This might be due to some sort of a bhoot in them

548
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:11,440
as children.

549
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:15,160
But when they are five years of age,

550
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:19,000
supposing now, you ask somebody, a child from here,

551
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,480
"See now, what do you see?"

552
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:23,480
He says, "I see a tiger here, and these flowers,

553
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,120
this, this, all this I see."

554
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,160
But if you make him stand there,

555
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,480
supposing somebody's standing that side,

556
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,560
what will he see? Still he will say he sees tiger,

557
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:36,400
flowers, this that. You try.

558
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,480
Because he cannot see the point of view of another person.

559
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:43,600
He's just busy with his ego.

560
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:47,960
Now the whole culture in the West, I have found now

561
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,560
- I don't know, formally it was not so,

562
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:54,680
parents had a great grip over the children,

563
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:56,880
and they had responsibility of children,

564
00:36:57,080 --> 00:37:00,680
they behaved well so that children should be all right.

565
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,840
Not like before the children they go on fighting
with each other.

566
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,200
I mean, they must be fighting little bit,

567
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:09,240
but in the bedrooms they must be doing.

568
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,240
Because I have not seen films, when I was young,

569
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,320
where the husband/wife are only all the time fighting,

570
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,280
or going for divorce.

571
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,280
No, at all, understanding between husband and wife,

572
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,320
but when it is another woman or another man,

573
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:25,440
their face is going like this.

574
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:27,240
If you see on the street

575
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,560
two people going with each other like this,

576
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:33,720
then you know these two are not husband and wife.

577
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,400
This is modern times.

578
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,080
These are modern times.

579
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,000
And the West is the worst.

580
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,920
So what happens that the parents are also not grown up,

581
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,120
they are not matured, they have no sense of responsibility.

582
00:37:51,320 --> 00:37:54,000
They have got children, how to behave with the husband,

583
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,400
specially the women here are extremely,

584
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,640
extremely dominating and stupid.

585
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,920
I must say.

586
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,440
They don't know anything about cooking;

587
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,280
they don't know anything about anything.

588
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,360
They can only carrier girls, they can go,

589
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,320
sit in the bank and write something.

590
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,080
And they're extremely stupid;

591
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:16,640
they don't know how to handle their husbands,

592
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:19,720
they don't know how to handle their children.

593
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:22,240
They have had no training.

594
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,480
Their mother's paid no attention to them.

595
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:28,560
No disciplining at all.

596
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:32,760
So this-ego oriented child is still ego-oriented.

597
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,520
No love, no affection.

598
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:38,400
We would say My Mother was a very strict person.

599
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
Extremely strict.

600
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,120
But she was extremely loving also - extremely loving,

601
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:46,400
extremely strict, just like Jagadamba.

602
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,360
I mean, she would make us cook food,

603
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,320
even the handle how you hold.

604
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,200
She would tell us, "This is not the angle,

605
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,520
it's not the way, you do this way!

606
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,720
Why are you standing like this?

607
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,600
Where is your attention?"

608
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,480
And no questions were to be asked.

609
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,080
All that disciplining and all that thing

610
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:12,240
which came to us in our childhood is today helpful to us.

611
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,040
And they were extremely loving.

612
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,520
They were for our benevolence,

613
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,800
whatever they did were for our benevolence.

614
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,920
But I think, specially in Switzerland,

615
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:27,240
I always felt that the mothers are uneducated

616
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:30,560
and they're extremely jealous of their daughters also.

617
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,280
Our mothers, My mother was very well educated,

618
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,080
but her mother was not.

619
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:40,240
But she was a wise woman.

620
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
She had her sense of responsibility,

621
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,680
she knows she was a mother

622
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:47,840
and she has to behave herself.

623
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:50,720
She has not to be childish and stupid.

624
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:55,120
So because that love was not given to these ladies,

625
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,720
they are still ego-oriented.

626
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,200
They're still babies.

627
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,920
They're not yet grown up.

628
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,480
Still they cannot see the other person's point of view

629
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,400
and they become extremely obstinate:

630
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,680
"No, this is true!"

631
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:16,440
Now let us face it,

632
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:19,240
today you have had this Puja of Adi Shakti,

633
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,320
is a dangerous one,

634
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,160
because this is like a mirror

635
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,400
where you will have to see yourself

636
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,520
clearly, face yourself.

637
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,680
To dominate your husband is a stupid nonsense.

638
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,160
Because you don't know

639
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,440
how to handle your husband, that's why.

640
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,120
I would say Indian women dominate

641
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:51,680
their husbands all right, in a way.

642
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,760
The husbands can't do without their wives,

643
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,000
can't do without their wives.

644
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:00,040
They don't know even how to pack their things,

645
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,280
they don't know how to even make tea,

646
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:04,040
they don't know how to boil an egg,

647
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,320
they don't know anything.

648
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:10,200
They don't know even how to lock the house,

649
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,800
open

650
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:21,160
even open the wardrobe,

651
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,800
how to spread a bed.

652
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,600
They don't know anything whatsoever that is practical.

653
00:41:31,840 --> 00:41:34,040
I mean I would say that

654
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:36,080
my husband would always come and ask Me,

655
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,960
"Is this tie all right?"

656
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:40,040
I mean this is since long, now he knows I'm Adi Shakti,

657
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,360
but before also.

658
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:45,800
He used to come and ask,

659
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,640
"Is it all right?" "No, no it's no good."

660
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,880
All right, he would change.

661
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:55,280
But because you are not grown up,

662
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:56,560
you are not matured,

663
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,440
you don't know how to handle your husbands.

664
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:00,440
You try to dominate.

665
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:02,560
And then the children learn from you,

666
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,840
they also try to dominate you.

667
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:12,240
Apparently, you must understand,

668
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:15,200
it is

669
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,320
the authority coming from the top.

670
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:22,000
Like I always will say,

671
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,920
"I am not God, Sadashiva is God."

672
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:28,280
Gregoire was quiet shocked when I told him first this thing.

673
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,680
But I am God also.

674
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,960
Without Me what is He? I'm His Power.

675
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,200
He's powerless.

676
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:42,480
But let Him be God, good.

677
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,880
Because if you have to blame someone,

678
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:52,040
you blame Him, He's God.

679
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:56,240
But I have to work hard to keep Him pleased.

680
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,120
Otherwise you know, He doesn't care for anyone.

681
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:02,280
He'll just destroy, that's all He knows.

682
00:43:03,840 --> 00:43:05,000
He'll destroy you,

683
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,120
anybody tries to play any tricks with Me,

684
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,160
He'll destroy you so badly that for lives together

685
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:13,000
you cannot become a human being.

686
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,360
He's like that, a terrible fellow.

687
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,320
He's the One Who has done all these things, you know.

688
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,400
So, we have to grow.

689
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:29,560
We have to grow as wise women,

690
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:37,360
as women who are like the Mother Earth, as I told you.

691
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,200
And when you ask me that

692
00:43:41,400 --> 00:43:44,320
"Mother, You work so hard, and You look so fresh."

693
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,400
Because I enjoy it.

694
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:50,000
It's like a music to Me.

695
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,360
Doing work is a music to Me.

696
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:55,440
Cooking is a music to Me.

697
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,280
Everything is a music to Me.

698
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:00,520
Do you get tired of music?

699
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,200
On the contrary you feel fresh.

700
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,280
And when I kill demons,

701
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,120
as you must have seen there,

702
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:12,280
I get more enlightened, more light comes into Me.

703
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,240
It's the other way round.

704
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,320
So, I have to make you understand that

705
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,480
today please have full introspection,

706
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:32,200
soul search.

707
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:36,320
Find out what's wrong with us.

708
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,400
Do not pamper your ego,

709
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:43,520
because ego makes you idiotic,

710
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,240
that you must have seen.

711
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,360
We have some people in Sahaja Yoga

712
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:49,160
who are like that, idiots.

713
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,520
But they think knowing of themselves.

714
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:52,760
We all know that.

715
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:56,880
We have to have some buffoons also in the circus.

716
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:06,160
But we have to have lions and tigers.

717
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,760
What impresses the people are the lions and the tigers

718
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:17,880
and not the buffoons.

719
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:22,040
So, it is important, let us have the introspection

720
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,080
and see for ourselves

721
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:28,280
how much we have done for Sahaja Yoga.

722
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:34,560
Of course, I have to congratulate you for one thing.

723
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,000
Because, you know, I am like that.

724
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:42,400
I have done nothing to be like that, I'm just like that,

725
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,240
I am.

726
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:46,040
So I'm the Power!

727
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,560
If I have the Power, because I am the Power.

728
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,400
What is there to feel very elated about it?

729
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:02,560
I do not feel that way at all.

730
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:09,240
But if I do not use My Power,

731
00:46:10,920 --> 00:46:14,000
then I become like a human being.

732
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,280
Why I am the Goddess?

733
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,400
Because I use every bit of My Power.

734
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:28,480
And if you people do not use your power,

735
00:46:29,120 --> 00:46:32,360
out of any nonsense, any fear you may have.

736
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:37,280
You may have any kind of a temptation,

737
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,880
or restriction, anything.

738
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:44,560
If you're not going all out to use your power of love,

739
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,400
then you cannot ascent.

740
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:51,080
So the whole thing if you see so clearly,

741
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:54,320
the whole Power of your Mother is of love.

742
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,400
Whatever She does is out of Her love for Her creation.

743
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:08,000
And the introspection starts,

744
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,880
but it should not be late.

745
00:47:10,080 --> 00:47:11,240
I used to say since long

746
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,560
the way they are exhausting the Mother Earth,

747
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,080
making so many things.

748
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,800
You must have heard Me saying this,

749
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:20,200
for the last eighteen years I've been saying this.

750
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,240
Today now ecological problems

751
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,200
standing like a rakshasa before you.

752
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,640
Now what do you do with him?

753
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:35,160
So you face then.

754
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:40,240
Automatically you have to face yourself, your destruction.

755
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:44,440
Introspection, if you do not do now,

756
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,480
you'll face it at a time when it will be very late.

757
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:53,640
So don't be just satisfied with yourself,

758
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:00,000
that you have now Sahaja Yogi, so done.

759
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,800
If you have come to My Puja of course,

760
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,360
like if you fall into the sea,

761
00:48:07,560 --> 00:48:11,160
the sea has a power to absorb you.

762
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:14,640
But also has a power to throw you back on the shores.

763
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:17,520
It acts both ways.

764
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,440
So why can't I go deep into Sahaja Yoga?

765
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:35,280
There are excuses also: I have got no time, I am very busy,

766
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:37,720
I am working in the office, I am doing that.

767
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,920
Then you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

768
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:45,360
All your time is for Sahaja Yoga.

769
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,840
But because of that,

770
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:53,360
Sahaja Yoga gives you sufficient time to do everything.

771
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,000
I know of people,

772
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:03,880
whom I suddenly find in the Pujas,

773
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,680
sometimes in Vancouver, sometimes in San Diego,

774
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:09,760
sometimes here.

775
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,440
I said, "How are you here, what about your business?"

776
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,440
He said, "The business has brought us here,

777
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,120
exactly on this date."

778
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:23,120
When this Power is so great, to realize it,

779
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:26,320
to know how great it is,

780
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:29,800
then you leave everything to this Power.

781
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,920
It works out for you everything.

782
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,240
So today we are talking about Shakti,

783
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:41,480
about the Power of the Goddess,

784
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:46,000
which are much more to be discovered

785
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:49,280
and too intricate,

786
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:53,680
very well balanced and extremely efficient.

787
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,520
But whatever work these Powers have done within you,

788
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:04,800
please try to respect them.

789
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:16,480
Please, try to assimilate them,

790
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,120
and let your being grow.

791
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:24,520
Don't say that "Now I'm married,"

792
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,760
or that "I've got pregnancy,"

793
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,960
that "I've got children, I've got jobs," nothing.

794
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:35,080
Everything becomes perfect,

795
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,200
as soon as you perfect yourself.

796
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,360
Everything is related to your perfection.

797
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,040
Then you don't ask Me question,

798
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,000
"What job I have to do Mother,

799
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:55,120
what I have to achieve?"

800
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:58,040
Nothing.

801
00:50:58,840 --> 00:51:04,320
You just see your way through and everything works out.

802
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,880
So, all the demons were killed,

803
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:17,160
they are again back in their own seats.

804
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,800
The worst thing is they have entered

805
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,440
into the heads of the seekers,

806
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:25,640
because they have come as gurus now.

807
00:51:27,880 --> 00:51:30,200
They've come as Catholic Church,

808
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:32,480
as Protestant Church,

809
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:36,280
as all kinds of temples

810
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:40,240
and all kinds of fundamentalist and all that.

811
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:43,400
All they look like rakshasas also,

812
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,680
if you look at them.

813
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:51,040
And when they influence you, they go into your heads.

814
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,200
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

815
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,360
even those heads are cleansed

816
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:58,480
and you are all right, out of it.

817
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:01,720
But then what to do with this,

818
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:05,720
with doing all this work,

819
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:12,240
cleansing, and giving joy, and everything, then what to do?

820
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:16,480
You have to give it to others!

821
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,680
This is your responsibility.

822
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:25,200
So first of all your character, your behavior,

823
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:29,880
your relationships should be so pure

824
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,160
that, by itself, it will emit light.

825
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:39,040
Like if you have a very clean glass,

826
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:41,520
the light can pass.

827
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:50,280
But also, Kundalini being the pure desire,

828
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:55,400
you must have a very fervent and extremely bubbling,

829
00:52:55,600 --> 00:53:02,360
you can call it a absolutely pouring out desire

830
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,440
whom to give vibrations, now, whom to give realization.

831
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:10,320
You give it to the trees,

832
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,360
you give it to the dogs, you give it to anyone,

833
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,360
and if you find human beings also give them.

834
00:53:18,840 --> 00:53:21,160
Rather difficult.

835
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,480
So, that has to be done.

836
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,440
But whatever you are doing,

837
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:39,600
keep attention in your connection.

838
00:53:40,480 --> 00:53:42,200
But here they are doing Sahaja Yoga,

839
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,200
and there your connection is loose,

840
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,320
then what you are giving? Sahaja Yog or what?

841
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,400
You are giving darkness?

842
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:53,120
Your are giving ignorance.

843
00:53:55,720 --> 00:53:58,040
You are giving madness.

844
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:04,120
So, to this powerful Shakti

845
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:11,320
you must all the time keep connection, and keep Her pleased.

846
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,920
Like the protocol

847
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,080
is very important because all these you see.

848
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,800
They have the protocol sense, because They are fixed.

849
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,120
You should also fix your protocol properly.

850
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:36,800
It's rather

851
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:46,760
difficult or embarrassing

852
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:51,480
as a human being for Me to tell you

853
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,680
what should be the protocol of the Goddess. Really.

854
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:56,920
But I have to tell you;

855
00:54:57,120 --> 00:54:59,880
because I don't want you should be harmed.

856
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:03,400
But the protocol must be observed

857
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,760
and could be understood very well.

858
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:15,080
Of course, it's much better now.

859
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:22,160
First time they had My Puja, in Delhi,

860
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,720
they did My aarti with a plastic plate,

861
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:30,840
and the kum-kum was kept in plastic boxes,

862
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:33,840
and I was so much worried about these people

863
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:37,040
that My whole body had shrunk like this controlling Them,

864
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,320
"Now don't do anything!"

865
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,280
If you see My photograph you'll see Me very different.

866
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,920
I was so surprised they didn't know what to do.

867
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:54,200
All right, now, please also

868
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:59,760
pay attention to your protocol.

869
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,160
For example people walk just early in the morning

870
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:06,400
in their pajamas, that's not proper.

871
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,880
You must dress up properly.

872
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:13,360
You're going, you don't know what Adi Shakti is.

873
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,200
Or you know?

874
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:19,720
If you know then you are going to face Adi Shakti.

875
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,600
Protocol must be understood.

876
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:33,000
For that, luckily, in India, people have lot of sense;

877
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:36,320
also they are sometimes missing in it.

878
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,440
So, protocol is very important

879
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,000
because These will be really furious

880
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,040
if you don't keep the protocol.

881
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:58,440
That is extremely important.

882
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:01,760
That's why Christ has said

883
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:04,560
He'll "tolerate anything against Myself,

884
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:07,760
but nothing against the Holy Ghost."

885
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,280
And also He has said that,

886
00:57:11,480 --> 00:57:13,600
"Beware of the murmuring souls"

887
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:18,360
because if you murmur on My back, I hear everything.

888
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:21,760
They're reporting all the time.

889
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:26,320
If you do anything on My back, I know what's happening.

890
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:33,520
I give time. But then it acts.

891
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:40,000
It's for your benevolence, for your good,

892
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,120
for your ascent for which you have fought for ages!

893
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,000
You must respect yourself

894
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,160
that you are seekers,

895
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:55,440
and now you have found out the truth.

896
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,480
So, make a crown out of it,

897
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:00,680
and put it on your head.

898
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,920
Now you are like lords.

899
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,280
Unless and until

900
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:17,640
you know what powers you have and how you got them,

901
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:20,360
and you remember it,

902
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:25,880
and also this truth becomes part and parcel of you,

903
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,160
your growth is going to be difficult.

904
00:58:29,360 --> 00:58:31,200
You'll be neither here nor there,

905
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:34,080
hanging in the air like a pendulum going here to there,

906
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:36,280
left to the right, right to the left.

907
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,520
And a Sahaja Yogini should be ashamed to say

908
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:43,200
that "I'll go on the left, or I'll go on the right."

909
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:46,520
How can you be so vulnerable?

910
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:51,600
Because you have not grown.

911
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:55,840
You have to be like Rock of Gibraltar.

912
00:58:57,560 --> 00:59:00,360
How can you catch?

913
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:05,160
All right, if you think somebody is extremely negative,

914
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:07,640
don't go near that person.

915
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:13,440
But you cannot become a dainty darlings.

916
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:23,680
My children are viras, shivalrous.

917
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,360
They have to be.

918
00:59:26,920 --> 00:59:28,560
You are My children.

919
00:59:28,760 --> 00:59:32,240
You are no more Christians, Hindus, Muslims,

920
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:40,320
you are no more all these horrible demonic people,

921
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:42,960
but you are My children and you have to be brave,

922
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:44,680
you have to be righteous,

923
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,560
you have to be good, you have to be compassionate,

924
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,920
you have to be dynamic.

925
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:51,320
That's the minimum.

926
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,920
I hope after this Puja you'll sit down,

927
00:59:57,120 --> 00:59:59,920
meditate and do introspection,

928
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:05,840
and find out, "Why I do it? What is the problem?"

929
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:11,640
Say, some people yesterday were dozing off, I saw them.

930
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:14,600
Because of left Nabhi.

931
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:18,640
So correct your left Nabhi.

932
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:30,960
But if you are really connected with this Divine Power,

933
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:34,400
you may keep awake for three days and three nights,

934
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:35,840
you'll not be tired.

935
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,280
It has happened with you sometimes.

936
01:00:38,480 --> 01:00:40,560
But attention should be on the Power,

937
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,400
attention should be on the connection

938
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,960
that we have with this Power.

939
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,480
Then only. Otherwise you'll be exhausted, naturally.

940
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:53,720
Everything's so logical, so logical it is.

941
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:58,880
Thank God, and thank yourself,

942
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:01,400
thank your luck you're so fortunate

943
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:05,120
that you are very few who have achieved this connection,

944
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,000
and that you are sucking that power

945
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:10,280
within yourself so easily.

946
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:12,520
And what are you, why are you behaving

947
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:18,120
like this ordinary street people with your stupid questions?

948
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:30,560
You'll be surprised that Goddess,

949
01:01:31,400 --> 01:01:35,400
in previous lives, never spoke so much as I've spoken.

950
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:39,400
One or two words were sufficient,

951
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:45,360
like She said, "Hoo!" and killed this, "Ha!" finished that.

952
01:01:45,560 --> 01:01:47,440
All these things She managed

953
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:49,800
only by saying "Hoo, Ha, Hee, Hey".

954
01:01:51,840 --> 01:01:55,880
But They never gave Realization to anyone,

955
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,560
none of the Incarnations.

956
01:01:58,760 --> 01:02:01,520
They said, "No, no, no, no, no not Me.

957
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:05,600
Not Me, sorry, I'm not going to do it.

958
01:02:06,520 --> 01:02:09,800
They must have seen human beings how stupid they are.

959
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,000
"Oh God, nothing. I'm all right.

960
01:02:13,240 --> 01:02:16,960
I can go to jungle for fourteen years,

961
01:02:17,520 --> 01:02:22,760
I can do the driver's job with Arjuna,

962
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,160
or I can get crucified, or I can take poison,

963
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:30,240
but don't tell Me to deal with human beings!

964
01:02:30,440 --> 01:02:32,440
No, no, no, no.

965
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,880
Is better to go to a zoo than to go to this."

966
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:41,680
And that's why none of Them, none of Them,

967
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:45,360
and some of Them did not even talk about it,

968
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:47,560
thinking that "If We talk, they'll say,

969
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,640
"Then why not give us the Realization?"

970
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:54,440
None of them.

971
01:02:55,240 --> 01:03:02,360
So this is the Adi Shakti's compassion, love, and confidence

972
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:07,600
that you should have also confidence.

973
01:03:07,800 --> 01:03:10,120
Not only that I have given you Realization,

974
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:11,640
but I have given you powers

975
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:14,640
that you can give Realizations to others.

976
01:03:14,840 --> 01:03:17,400
None of these Incarnations did that,

977
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,680
which you are doing today.

978
01:03:25,720 --> 01:03:28,520
With all Their Powers, They did not do it,

979
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:30,560
while you can do it,

980
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:34,760
despite the fact the instruments are not so strong,

981
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:38,640
not so Divine.

982
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:46,440
But still, still, we have to come up,

983
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:53,240
and work out in our own lives

984
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,720
the priorities that we have.

985
01:03:57,520 --> 01:04:00,920
For the Gods the priorities were only Divine work,

986
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:02,920
nothing else.

987
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:06,400
Nobody took up a job, nobody.

988
01:04:07,840 --> 01:04:11,760
Nobody went to university, nobody studied.

989
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:17,240
Only thing They did

990
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,000
was the work of God.

991
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:33,320
So you do everything else as work of God

992
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:39,960
and that's how the energy will flow into you.

993
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,880
When you start doing the work of God,

994
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:47,200
everything you do becomes work of God

995
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:52,000
in the sense that you do the work of God, you decide,

996
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:54,760
"I'm going to do the work of God," then God takes over.

997
01:04:54,960 --> 01:04:56,800
He does all the rest of the things,

998
01:04:57,000 --> 01:05:00,080
you do only the work of God, He takes over.

999
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:05,120
I hope you understand this, try.

1000
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:08,480
Try.

1001
01:05:08,680 --> 01:05:11,120
Have confidence.

1002
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:19,160
And also thank God there is Someone, like your Mother,

1003
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:21,440
Who can tell you what's wrong with you.

1004
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,640
Thank God!

1005
01:05:23,840 --> 01:05:26,240
Even your mothers didn't tell you what was wrong,

1006
01:05:26,440 --> 01:05:29,360
because they were so frightened of you.

1007
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,280
And don't say then - then, when you say something,

1008
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,000
"Mother, my heart catches."

1009
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:40,680
I mean, what can you do, then?

1010
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,000
If you understand that this is for your improvement

1011
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:52,440
I am doing it, it's out of love, out of concern,

1012
01:05:53,680 --> 01:05:56,560
then you'll work it out.

1013
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:02,560
But I don't think it is so much of a mental understanding,

1014
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:08,000
but it's the understanding of a higher level,

1015
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:12,920
where it becomes just part and parcel of your awareness.

1016
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,680
"How can it be wrong?

1017
01:06:15,960 --> 01:06:20,040
It's all has to be good for me, everything is good for me."

1018
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,840
Last but not the least,

1019
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:30,800
one must understand that as all these seven chakras

1020
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:35,000
I am working on are in a collective way held

1021
01:06:35,600 --> 01:06:37,760
by Me in My Virata.

1022
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,720
The quality of Viratangana is that,

1023
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,000
that She creates this universal awareness within us,

1024
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:48,640
the collectivity.

1025
01:06:50,600 --> 01:06:56,000
And, if you do not realize that in modern times

1026
01:06:56,240 --> 01:07:03,120
we are in a spiritual path in a collective way only.

1027
01:07:07,240 --> 01:07:08,600
This is what it is.

1028
01:07:08,840 --> 01:07:12,680
Because we have reached to the state of Sahasrara

1029
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:19,680
and here we have to have a collective working only,

1030
01:07:19,880 --> 01:07:22,920
there's no other way out!

1031
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:29,720
This is what is to be absolutely realized.

1032
01:07:30,320 --> 01:07:36,720
Anybody who tries to harm the collectivity by bad behavior,

1033
01:07:36,920 --> 01:07:38,960
or by anything,

1034
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:41,400
will be thrown out, no doubt,

1035
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:46,720
but also will fall into wrong hands.

1036
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:51,560
So collectivity is the work of Adi Shakti.

1037
01:07:52,080 --> 01:07:54,280
Because at the Sahasrara,

1038
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,200
at the Sahasrara,

1039
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:59,720
at the Sahasrara is the rule of Virata.

1040
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,240
And the Power of Virata is the Viratangana.

1041
01:08:03,440 --> 01:08:06,360
Is the One Who does collectivity.

1042
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:10,080
This is the most important point we must know

1043
01:08:10,280 --> 01:08:15,720
if we cannot be collective - because of anything,

1044
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:19,200
jealousy maybe, inferiority complex maybe, any,

1045
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,400
anything which is coming from behind

1046
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,960
like a worm crawling up -then,

1047
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,400
know that something wrong with you,

1048
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,640
nothing wrong with the collectivity.

1049
01:08:30,160 --> 01:08:32,520
Don't criticize the collectivity,

1050
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:36,720
till I Myself find it out, and I'll put it right.

1051
01:08:36,920 --> 01:08:40,120
Keep to the collectivity, wisely

1052
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:46,320
and earnestly and try to keep the collectivity together.

1053
01:08:49,840 --> 01:08:54,360
Try to help to keep the people collective to enjoy together.

1054
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:57,080
Don't criticize each other;

1055
01:08:58,080 --> 01:08:59,600
only criticize yourself.

1056
01:08:59,800 --> 01:09:02,600
If you are in the habit of criticism,

1057
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,680
better criticize yourself.

1058
01:09:04,880 --> 01:09:07,960
It's better, because these are habits also.

1059
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,440
People, specially I've seen people in the West,

1060
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:13,000
they react to everything.

1061
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,400
If they see this carpet,

1062
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,160
"Uh! I don't like it!"

1063
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:18,360
But this is not yours, not made for you,

1064
01:09:18,640 --> 01:09:20,200
what have you got to do with it?

1065
01:09:20,400 --> 01:09:23,320
"No, I don't like it!" But it's not yours,

1066
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,320
what's the question?

1067
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:28,360
It's lying here, why should you be so upset about it?

1068
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:33,160
"I don't like that person! I don't like that dress!"

1069
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:36,400
Who are you?

1070
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,680
"I don't like."

1071
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:46,600
This is not allowed in Sahaja Yoga - "I don't like."

1072
01:09:49,080 --> 01:09:52,960
There is a way of saying things.

1073
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:57,160
But there is no need to say anything whatsoever.

1074
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:05,840
So all this kind of bumptiousness

1075
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:10,800
and showing off is against collectivity.

1076
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:15,360
Then there are some other stupid type of people

1077
01:10:15,560 --> 01:10:18,560
who are always there to take My photograph I've seen.

1078
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:22,040
You tell them, "Don't be so forward, don't go."

1079
01:10:22,240 --> 01:10:25,360
"No, I will, I don't do this, I am not. Finished!"

1080
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:29,400
But they, some of them are really confirmed,

1081
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,480
certified I think, stupid, idiots.

1082
01:10:34,680 --> 01:10:36,280
They cannot be improved.

1083
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,520
But I told you that don't make them your ideals,

1084
01:10:39,760 --> 01:10:42,600
don't follow their images.

1085
01:10:43,040 --> 01:10:47,440
So then, we come to this point,

1086
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:54,400
that Adi Shakti's work is the most important work

1087
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:57,880
in the whole creation.

1088
01:10:58,200 --> 01:11:00,160
All right killing the demons was over,

1089
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:02,280
what is it?

1090
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,520
Done!

1091
01:11:04,160 --> 01:11:08,160
Saraswati's work was done, She created dinosaurs so what?

1092
01:11:08,360 --> 01:11:09,760
Mahalakshmi's work was done.

1093
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,880
She brought you to human level, all right, so what?

1094
01:11:13,160 --> 01:11:16,800
But the climax is now that you have got your Realization,

1095
01:11:17,000 --> 01:11:20,000
that you have got this special quality,

1096
01:11:20,840 --> 01:11:24,360
that now you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

1097
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,760
So now behave yourself.

1098
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:30,600
And also you must have that dignity to know that,

1099
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,640
now we have entered into the Kingdom of God.

1100
01:11:35,360 --> 01:11:42,400
I've seen, once I was going to see the President of India.

1101
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,560
But to Me he was another human being,

1102
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,800
I mean, it never goes into My head this presidentship

1103
01:11:48,040 --> 01:11:49,280
and all that.

1104
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:50,680
I was walking up,

1105
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,240
and those who were walking with Me became very conscious,

1106
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,200
you see, like this.

1107
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,240
I said, "What's the matter with these people?

1108
01:11:56,440 --> 01:11:58,680
Have they seen some ghost or something?"

1109
01:11:58,880 --> 01:12:01,240
Just going on the steps.

1110
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,880
And they were some people standing with, you see,

1111
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:07,800
spears and things as guards,

1112
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,360
or whatever it is. So, I was just laughing at all that.

1113
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:14,440
But these people became very conscious.

1114
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,040
When you are entering into the Kingdom of God,

1115
01:12:19,880 --> 01:12:23,840
how conscious you should be about your behavior!

1116
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:29,880
How you should be,

1117
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:32,640
how you should behave?

1118
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:46,040
Just feel the uniqueness of your personality

1119
01:12:46,240 --> 01:12:49,400
that you are in the Kingdom of God already.

1120
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,080
Just feel it.

1121
01:12:51,320 --> 01:12:53,240
If you can feel only that,

1122
01:12:53,480 --> 01:12:58,440
then you will know what a place of pride you have got

1123
01:12:58,680 --> 01:13:01,600
and how dignified you should be.

1124
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,120
How beautiful you should be.

1125
01:13:04,320 --> 01:13:12,400
How neat and clean and sweet you should be.

1126
01:13:13,960 --> 01:13:17,800
How much maryadas you must know, everything.

1127
01:13:20,480 --> 01:13:28,880
And when you will realize that now you are the coveted,

1128
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:37,120
or we can say the highest citizens of the Kingdom of God,

1129
01:13:37,640 --> 01:13:44,360
then you have to prove that you have really realized it.

1130
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,960
That you really feel that.

1131
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:52,640
And you should feel extremely joyful, happy.

1132
01:13:52,840 --> 01:13:56,360
Like yesterday, at the smallest thing everybody's laughing

1133
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,080
like the other street people.

1134
01:13:58,280 --> 01:13:59,520
It's not the Sahaja Yoga.

1135
01:13:59,720 --> 01:14:01,640
If there was a big joke or something, laugh,

1136
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:04,600
otherwise somebody is talking, you're laughing.

1137
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:09,600
I was surprised, you're Sahaja Yogis.

1138
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,520
Think of saints doing this, will they do?

1139
01:14:14,680 --> 01:14:16,440
You are saints;

1140
01:14:16,640 --> 01:14:19,720
you are munindras with smanana,

1141
01:14:19,920 --> 01:14:24,960
with your meditation you have become the kings.

1142
01:14:27,520 --> 01:14:31,600
How can you behave in a indignified manner?

1143
01:14:33,320 --> 01:14:36,480
Now, try to assume your position!

1144
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:40,760
Try to feel it.

1145
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:46,320
Yesterday, of course, when the last song started,

1146
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:53,600
it did penetrate, I know, into many souls, to many hearts,

1147
01:14:54,480 --> 01:15:00,560
that unique joy, which we call as nirananda.

1148
01:15:01,120 --> 01:15:03,120
I did feel it yesterday.

1149
01:15:03,320 --> 01:15:07,280
But keep it up, it's just to be kept very safely

1150
01:15:07,760 --> 01:15:11,440
into your Khumbas, is the Kundalini.

1151
01:15:11,640 --> 01:15:14,120
And She is the One Who has come up.

1152
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:17,280
So, My idea was that

1153
01:15:17,480 --> 01:15:21,040
today is not only the worship of the Khumba,

1154
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:25,640
where the Kundalini resides,

1155
01:15:25,840 --> 01:15:30,720
but the Khumba becomes like a flower pot.

1156
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:36,360
It's like that, that has happened

1157
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:40,520
and then it can also, as somebody said that,

1158
01:15:40,720 --> 01:15:46,800
"Mother these flower pots also can become table lamps."

1159
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:50,240
I said, "See, now, you've said it!"

1160
01:15:50,440 --> 01:15:54,640
So the Khumba becoming flowers, and flowers becoming light,

1161
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,440
and the lights with fragrance!

1162
01:16:01,080 --> 01:16:03,360
I hope you'll understand My vision

1163
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:05,320
and you'll stand by Me,

1164
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:07,280
you'll come up to that.

1165
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:11,520
I depend on you entirely for My vision.

1166
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,080
We have to change this whole world into a beautiful place.

1167
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:19,480
Now for that not much sacrifice is needed.

1168
01:16:19,680 --> 01:16:22,720
You're already blessed, you don't have to do much,

1169
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:29,800
only thing is keep your attention on the source of Power.

1170
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:32,840
May God bless you.

1171
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:40,320
Ah? Thank you.

1172
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,960
Mathias says, "We promise." You all say that.

1173
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:58,600
Thank you very much.

1174
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:18,080
You should all write some of the miracles,

1175
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,400
and how things work out.

1176
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:27,120
Like we went to Paris,

1177
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:30,440
and they wanted to buy some saris for the ladies here,

1178
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:34,280
and nowhere we could get anything forty-five inches.

1179
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:36,240
Either it was thirty-six inches,

1180
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,440
or it was fifty-eight inches.

1181
01:17:40,600 --> 01:17:45,560
Then while going in the car, suddenly I said, "Now stop!"

1182
01:17:46,160 --> 01:17:48,400
They said, "What Mother? In the street?" I said,

1183
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:51,480
"In the street only there is somebody selling the saris."

1184
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:54,560
And we got them.

1185
01:17:57,120 --> 01:17:59,000
Another - you have seen already

1186
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,560
in the Ganapatipule Ganesh Puja,

1187
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:10,080
that how we had a jackpot for your presents.

1188
01:18:10,760 --> 01:18:14,680
You used to always bring presents, very expensive and

1189
01:18:16,480 --> 01:18:19,560
of no artistic value, anything,

1190
01:18:19,760 --> 01:18:21,480
wasting so much money.

1191
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:25,800
Even national Pujas, you could not get anything.

1192
01:18:27,960 --> 01:18:31,640
And how we got this, just the same way.

1193
01:18:31,840 --> 01:18:34,520
Coming from the airport I just said,

1194
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,520
"Now there's something here!"

1195
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,320
They said, "Mother, nothing there's a shop."

1196
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,040
I said, "Let's go and see!"

1197
01:18:40,240 --> 01:18:44,080
Just we went round, and there all this things at a song.

1198
01:18:45,120 --> 01:18:47,080
Now same thing happened in America,

1199
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,200
I went down, I said, "The China is in trouble,

1200
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,840
let's buy something Chinese."

1201
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,960
So we went to the Chinese shops;

1202
01:18:54,160 --> 01:18:58,120
they were so expensive, very expensive.

1203
01:18:58,320 --> 01:19:00,600
And I turned the corner and I said,

1204
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:03,280
"All right let me go into a little lane,"

1205
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:07,240
and there it was, a shop which sold everything very cheaply,

1206
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,200
for again forty percent less.

1207
01:19:09,400 --> 01:19:11,560
Something has to do with forty percent.

1208
01:19:13,080 --> 01:19:17,320
And just by chance only, I think,

1209
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:21,480
hundred meters away they were selling at five times more,

1210
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:24,760
six times more. And why it is?

1211
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:27,920
So now you also try.

1212
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:32,280
But desire should be pure, understanding should be pure.

1213
01:19:32,480 --> 01:19:34,240
So I just thought that these Sahaja Yogis

1214
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:37,000
spend so much money, waste so much money,

1215
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:39,760
and get something which is of no value.

1216
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,600
Because all the presents you give Me, actually,

1217
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:46,040
I have been asking them to stop it, and stop it and stop it.

1218
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:47,480
Now from individual,

1219
01:19:47,680 --> 01:19:50,600
we have brought it to the level of national.

1220
01:19:50,800 --> 01:19:52,480
But even in the national,

1221
01:19:52,680 --> 01:19:55,520
I think we now should just have no national,

1222
01:19:55,720 --> 01:19:57,440
but one international, if you can manage next year

1223
01:19:57,640 --> 01:19:59,040
if you people agree.

1224
01:19:59,240 --> 01:20:01,960
But whatever it is,

1225
01:20:02,800 --> 01:20:04,960
whatever you give Me, I'm not going to sell it,

1226
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:06,680
I'm not going to give it to anyone,

1227
01:20:06,880 --> 01:20:08,720
it should be such that we can keep

1228
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:11,440
for the progeny to see what you have given.

1229
01:20:11,640 --> 01:20:13,680
It is the value of this is this,

1230
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:16,760
not the value how much you spent.

1231
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,560
So, there is no need for individually

1232
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:23,000
to give Me any presents at all, I know you love Me.

1233
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,240
And now, I don't know, I've been telling the leaders

1234
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,280
that "Please don't ask for the national present,

1235
01:20:29,480 --> 01:20:30,960
now don't waste money."

1236
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:33,200
But I don't know if they are not yet agreeing,

1237
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:36,280
and if they agree we can stop this.

1238
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:38,720
And have even international present

1239
01:20:38,920 --> 01:20:41,520
which could be also brought down.

1240
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:43,960
Because you know, I don't need anything.

1241
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:45,960
But it works.

1242
01:20:46,160 --> 01:20:47,680
It works.

1243
01:20:47,880 --> 01:20:50,480
Like I said, "You give Me ivory this time,"

1244
01:20:50,680 --> 01:20:52,800
and ivory was so very expensive, everything,

1245
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:57,440
again that also we found it at a such a cheap place.

1246
01:20:58,920 --> 01:21:01,000
And once you gave Me the ivory,

1247
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:03,720
you won't believe, I read in the newspaper

1248
01:21:03,920 --> 01:21:06,720
that ivory used to be five hundreds dollars per kilo,

1249
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:10,400
now in America it is three dollars per kilo.

1250
01:21:11,640 --> 01:21:14,400
It's true or not?

1251
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,360
And also the idea is to give more encouragement

1252
01:21:18,560 --> 01:21:20,880
to handicrafts and to art,

1253
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:22,880
because so many times I have told that

1254
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:27,640
a little of a clay you can take and make it

1255
01:21:27,840 --> 01:21:31,000
into a beautiful thing which is worth such a lot.

1256
01:21:31,240 --> 01:21:33,320
So, why should we exhaust this Mother Earth?

1257
01:21:33,520 --> 01:21:37,120
Why not we have few artistic nice things,

1258
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,400
instead of having so many things?

1259
01:21:40,880 --> 01:21:43,640
But if you go in the shops now you don't get anything.

1260
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:46,200
You don't get silk, you cannot get this,

1261
01:21:46,400 --> 01:21:47,840
you cannot get that.

1262
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:50,560
So difficult to get anything natural,

1263
01:21:50,760 --> 01:21:54,800
because people have only making unnatural things.

1264
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:59,880
Whatever it is, in that also you should create beauty.

1265
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:01,680
If you start creating beauty,

1266
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:03,760
then we'll try to preserve it

1267
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:07,160
and use it sparingly instead of having thousands

1268
01:22:07,360 --> 01:22:10,600
of nonsensical things, everything disposable.

1269
01:22:10,880 --> 01:22:12,280
After sometime,

1270
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:15,440
we'll have to have human beings who are disposal.

1271
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:17,440
We'll have to dispose them off.

1272
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:18,840
How will they live on this earth

1273
01:22:19,040 --> 01:22:20,720
if we do not understand that

1274
01:22:20,920 --> 01:22:25,960
we have to live on this earth with its limitations.

1275
01:22:27,120 --> 01:22:29,360
See, I've been telling you, many times,

1276
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:33,320
take to artistic things, take to handmade things,

1277
01:22:33,520 --> 01:22:35,040
more to handmade.

1278
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:38,120
Don't go too much to this.

1279
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:41,400
At least, even if you have to buy something

1280
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,320
which is, say, artificial,

1281
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:49,040
at least see to it that it is artistic.

1282
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:01,120
So, the once you have a great desire

1283
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,480
- today is the day they want in the whole world to pray

1284
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:06,800
for the preservation of Mother Earth,

1285
01:23:07,000 --> 01:23:09,040
that's why I started this topic,

1286
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:12,760
that we should pray that we all should develop art,

1287
01:23:12,960 --> 01:23:17,000
develop for ourselves, give as presents to others,

1288
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:22,240
and also to use artistic things, made of artist.

1289
01:23:22,480 --> 01:23:24,800
We can have few things,

1290
01:23:24,960 --> 01:23:29,880
but artistic which expresses art.

1291
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:34,120
Not cheap things.

1292
01:23:34,320 --> 01:23:37,400
In the whole of France

1293
01:23:38,160 --> 01:23:43,160
what I saw was that into everything this plastics has crept

1294
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:47,240
in whether it is cotton, whether it is silk,

1295
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,000
whether it is wool.

1296
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:52,280
It can enter into everywhere

1297
01:23:52,480 --> 01:23:57,600
except for the brains of human beings. It's horrible.

1298
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,880
So, whatever it is,

1299
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:06,160
in that also see that you buy artistic things,

1300
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:13,880
not plain, horrible, cheap things.

1301
01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:18,120
All right? So this is what we have to today,

1302
01:24:18,320 --> 01:24:22,280
also, you have to pray to Me when you are doing puja,

1303
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:26,960
that "Oh, Mother, Oh Mother, please save our earth,

1304
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,840
and give people wisdom,

1305
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:33,080
that they should behave themselves.

1306
01:24:33,480 --> 01:24:34,400
And they should be conscious".

1307
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:38,400
And every Sahaja Yogi should be conscious

1308
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:42,440
about how much energy he is using of electricity,

1309
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:48,640
of telephones, or of water or of anything.

1310
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,200
We have to be frugal about it.

1311
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:55,880
If we do not take the responsibility of these things,

1312
01:24:56,080 --> 01:24:58,520
then it will not penetrate anywhere else.

1313
01:24:58,720 --> 01:25:01,240
It is for you to do it.

1314
01:25:04,320 --> 01:25:07,320
You have to take it up in your everyday life

1315
01:25:07,520 --> 01:25:11,360
as a part and parcel of your life

1316
01:25:11,560 --> 01:25:16,480
that you try to save the energy of this Mother Earth.

1317
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:18,720
Is very important.

1318
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:24,720
So today is the day they have sent a special prayer,

1319
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:27,880
of course it's done by some churches of whatever it is,

1320
01:25:28,080 --> 01:25:29,560
but I think is a good day,

1321
01:25:29,760 --> 01:25:31,400
because they must have thought today

1322
01:25:31,640 --> 01:25:33,560
is the day of the Goddess,

1323
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,200
and that's how they've asked for.

1324
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:42,840
May God bless you.

1325
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:15,920
And fourteen married ladies

1326
01:26:16,120 --> 01:26:24,440
who have not been yet for My puja.
