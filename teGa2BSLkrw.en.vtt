00:00:11.523 --> 00:00:20.289
Today we have gathered here to worship Shri Lakshmi.

00:00:23.882 --> 00:00:27.148
In Diwali, in India,

00:00:32.547 --> 00:00:39.310
they worship Lakshmi because

00:00:40.246 --> 00:00:46.096
a great rakshasa called Narakasura was killed.

00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:53.199
Also that Lakshmi came out of the sea,

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.409
at the same time - long time back. I mean, I should say, this is like

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.870
Her different appearances on the same geo region.

00:01:16.269 --> 00:01:24.269
Lakshmi is the Goddess which gives us wealth,

00:01:27.808 --> 00:01:33.401
gives us prosperity. She is very blissful, no doubt.

00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:42.876
She gives you protection and also She's very humble,

00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:50.788
because She stands on the Lotus. She's very light,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.038
means does not put her pressure on anyone.

00:01:55.671 --> 00:02:01.179
These are symbols of Shri Lakshmi.

00:02:02.498 --> 00:02:08.268
But also She is a part of Mahamaya in the modern times.

00:02:09.227 --> 00:02:12.961
When people get Lakshmi - the money -

00:02:13.596 --> 00:02:18.504
they don't understand that She is their Mother also

00:02:19.903 --> 00:02:23.722
and She is to be respected.

00:02:27.636 --> 00:02:34.183
When this kind of a perverse idea of Shri Lakshmi comes in,

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:45.587
such countries, such people meet their last end

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.150
and destruction of the worst type comes in.

00:02:54.657 --> 00:02:59.368
So this Lakshmi has to be used with a big balance,

00:02:59.666 --> 00:03:07.282
like standing on a Lotus and not get into the pond, where

00:03:08.181 --> 00:03:14.196
there are all kind of creatures to eat you all. You have to stand

00:03:14.571 --> 00:03:19.879
on the Lotus - that means, that you are above

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:28.136
all the lures of this Maya.

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:37.527
Also in Sanskrit and in our languages, we call Lakshmi as the Maya.

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.724
If somebody gets lot of money they would say - "He got lot of maya."

00:03:44.041 --> 00:03:46.783
Now this maya plays the tricks.

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:55.955
If money, prosperity, was the salvation,

00:03:57.213 --> 00:04:00.807
then there would have been no problems in this world

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:10.662
because those people who have money always get ruined.

00:04:11.498 --> 00:04:16.912
If they're not ruined, their children, their grandchildren get ruined.

00:04:18.162 --> 00:04:23.620
This principle of Lakshmi within us is very dubious

00:04:25.537 --> 00:04:30.152
and the allurement is so much

00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:35.566
that people see somebody having a good car these days,

00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:39.079
they think - "Ah, what a man he is!" -

00:04:39.376 --> 00:04:43.251
- in any case he's not going to give you the car.

00:04:44.751 --> 00:04:52.907
If somebody is having lots of, what you can call, palaces

00:04:53.844 --> 00:05:01.251
or buildings, people start admiring him! This is Kali Yuga.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.101
They start admiring, "See - this man is so rich."

00:05:10.805 --> 00:05:16.586
Even clothes, people see you wearing clothes

00:05:18.242 --> 00:05:25.070
which are very good tailored, might be from some designers, say

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:32.953
- they think no end of that man. For example in England,

00:05:33.547 --> 00:05:38.711
there is another befooling place called Saville Row.

00:05:39.258 --> 00:05:41.648
So if you want to buy one suit

00:05:41.867 --> 00:05:45.454
you have to pay sometimes three thousand pounds.

00:05:46.281 --> 00:05:52.192
Now people are so stupid, that now if they wear a suit

00:05:52.387 --> 00:05:56.988
from Saville Row, they put the brand outside. "Saville Row"!

00:05:59.581 --> 00:06:03.878
All such tomfoolery is going on all over the world.

00:06:04.386 --> 00:06:10.532
The clothes have no meaning, their lifestyle has no meaning,

00:06:11.548 --> 00:06:15.450
ultimately they end up in Swiss Bank.

00:06:17.157 --> 00:06:23.727
The Lakshmi tattwa of Swiss Bank is also now showing its teeth,

00:06:24.555 --> 00:06:30.274
and, if you read what's happening to them,

00:06:30.507 --> 00:06:35.461
I mean, they are shaking, they don't know.

00:06:35.914 --> 00:06:39.468
They went to this limit that they took

00:06:39.771 --> 00:06:43.883
the teeth, golden teeth of the Jews.

00:06:46.007 --> 00:06:54.249
I mean, it's going too far, all this tomfoolery has been going on.

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:59.951
Their military services says - why, who's going to conquer that country?

00:07:00.406 --> 00:07:03.370
Even Napolean didn't do that.

00:07:04.113 --> 00:07:08.050
And they have made big caves to keep their weapons there,

00:07:08.237 --> 00:07:15.073
who's going to attack them, stupid people, suffering from ego.

00:07:16.441 --> 00:07:23.495
But the attack has come; and this attack

00:07:24.675 --> 00:07:32.610
is so serious that they might be completely shattered and destroyed.

00:07:35.718 --> 00:07:39.226
Now who falls for this kind of thing, you should see,

00:07:39.414 --> 00:07:42.647
are the people who are crooks,

00:07:44.466 --> 00:07:51.998
who are dishonest, who are absolutely adharmics.

00:07:53.859 --> 00:07:59.130
They can be Mafia-dons, or they can be

00:07:59.482 --> 00:08:05.544
some thugs, some black marketeers, some smugglers.

00:08:05.826 --> 00:08:11.584
So going against the Lakshmi principle are so many done these days.

00:08:12.099 --> 00:08:16.849
One fellow who was thrown out of Sahaja Yoga, because

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.277
he was trying to be very dominating and all that.

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:25.996
He said, "That's better." I said "Why?" He's doing now smuggling,

00:08:26.238 --> 00:08:32.800
making money out of smuggling and he's become
very rich - according to him.

00:08:33.262 --> 00:08:38.863
But it comes to an end and a very tragic, bad end.

00:08:40.566 --> 00:08:45.059
Money is such a lure for human beings

00:08:46.832 --> 00:08:53.879
that it kills all sense of decency,

00:08:54.293 --> 00:08:58.441
of higher values, everything.

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:05.082
A brother say, who is very nice and good fellow,

00:09:05.308 --> 00:09:09.853
if he gets money out of proportion by all doing the hanky panky,

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.642
he neglects his mother, father, brother, sisters, everyone.

00:09:14.889 --> 00:09:17.428
So I would say then it comes to that point,

00:09:17.661 --> 00:09:21.232
that Lakshmiji becomes a bhoot then.

00:09:25.022 --> 00:09:29.529
And She - all Her blessings become sort of a

00:09:29.733 --> 00:09:33.233
challenge to your dignity.

00:09:35.730 --> 00:09:42.224
Now certain countries, like America - which is

00:09:44.168 --> 00:09:50.301
the area for Shri Krishna, because He's Kubera -

00:09:51.246 --> 00:09:53.879
- they have no money as such, I've seen,

00:09:54.074 --> 00:09:57.042
they are all poor, they are all indebted.

00:09:57.628 --> 00:10:04.565
So many Indians went to America and they can't come to India now

00:10:04.862 --> 00:10:08.230
- "Why?" "We're indebted." "Why are you indebted?"

00:10:08.628 --> 00:10:12.771
"Oh we get everything free now, see the bank gives us loan,

00:10:12.997 --> 00:10:15.935
we can have the best lifestyle."

00:10:17.654 --> 00:10:23.661
So they will have 3 Mercedes - is nothing, 3 Mercedes is nothing,

00:10:23.982 --> 00:10:30.740
we should have Rolls Royces, we should have this. For what?

00:10:36.193 --> 00:10:39.638
What do you get out of it?

00:10:41.294 --> 00:10:44.818
Now of course - little bit they are shaken up,

00:10:45.625 --> 00:10:49.688
with the stock exchange and all that nonsense they had started.

00:10:49.891 --> 00:10:54.649
All this joke and all these very big,

00:10:57.516 --> 00:11:00.242
I should say, camouflages,

00:11:02.156 --> 00:11:06.086
all now are coming out.

00:11:07.172 --> 00:11:10.214
So this is no Lakshmi, because Lakshmi must give you

00:11:10.417 --> 00:11:14.245
dignity, prosperity and respect.

00:11:17.112 --> 00:11:20.954
I think Americans understood about it so they became philanthropists,

00:11:21.165 --> 00:11:26.728
means they are giving money to people. Whom did they give money?

00:11:27.423 --> 00:11:31.157
All the names these people took from South

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:40.764
Africa - were all given money by the philanthropists of America.

00:11:41.045 --> 00:11:48.222
What has happened to their wisdom? That 16 year old boy, he went there,

00:11:48.475 --> 00:11:53.972
and then all ages went there and made a very big money.

00:11:55.558 --> 00:11:58.089
All this money-making proposition... -

00:11:58.285 --> 00:12:04.058
- can you give some seat to those musicians? [Hindi...]

00:13:09.792 --> 00:13:14.432
So what is the matter? If there's a blessing of Lakshmi,

00:13:14.635 --> 00:13:18.894
why a man who gets the blessing of Lakshmi

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:26.845
becomes so funny, so stupid, and ultimately ends up his life

00:13:27.298 --> 00:13:33.103
that people are not there even to pick up his dead body.

00:13:39.502 --> 00:13:47.486
What is the difference between money and Lakshmi?

00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:55.315
She gives you money all right, agreed,

00:13:55.643 --> 00:13:59.760
but when She's giving the money what happens to that money

00:13:59.995 --> 00:14:04.323
 which comes to you - is a very subtle thing one should understand.

00:14:07.995 --> 00:14:12.870
In India if you give, say hundred rupees to a servant,

00:14:13.299 --> 00:14:16.768
immediately he'll go to drink somewhere.

00:14:17.839 --> 00:14:23.456
First idea will come, what he should do, he'll go for a drink,

00:14:23.698 --> 00:14:29.283
of the hard ones, I mean, your Vodka is nowhere near that

00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:33.026
- such hard ones they make in India you know,

00:14:33.432 --> 00:14:37.839
it is called as ‘haath bhatti’: means made with hands.

00:14:38.776 --> 00:14:43.581
So in hundred rupees they are willing to go.

00:14:44.276 --> 00:14:49.995
I mean, that means any money you give to them,

00:14:50.676 --> 00:14:53.980
it spoils their life completely.

00:14:56.410 --> 00:15:01.558
Lakshmi has been given, all right, so what happens to this Lakshmi?

00:15:03.113 --> 00:15:09.668
 She changes Her form and Her form is so bad

00:15:10.011 --> 00:15:14.379
that you are completely ruined with that.

00:15:21.065 --> 00:15:30.572
So now, we have to understand what is the way we can use the Lakshmi.

00:15:35.665 --> 00:15:39.219
Supposing I get money, supposing.

00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:46.344
Then I will go to the market say,

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.954
and I'll see something nice - "Ah, this is

00:15:52.211 --> 00:15:57.868
very good for this Sahaja Yogi."

00:15:59.032 --> 00:16:05.391
Or I will say, "This will be very handy for our Ashram".

00:16:07.734 --> 00:16:11.578
Immediately the mind starts working in a very

00:16:11.774 --> 00:16:16.719
 socialistic way I should say, not individualistic.

00:16:17.118 --> 00:16:22.500
For example, I went to Rajasthan

00:16:23.321 --> 00:16:26.470
and I saw such a lot of sand,

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:33.193
just like a big desert, with dunes, everything - and people starving.

00:16:35.576 --> 00:16:40.466
So I said, "How to get money to these people?"

00:16:42.872 --> 00:16:46.943
So I said, "Let Me start a factory."

00:16:47.543 --> 00:16:56.730
A factory with the unbreakable glass which they make only in France.

00:16:58.527 --> 00:17:03.339
They make it very cheap and regard it as very cheap thing -

00:17:04.378 --> 00:17:09.526
-not in India. In India if you go to some elite's house

00:17:09.751 --> 00:17:16.782
they'll offer you tea, in these unbreakable things.

00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:19.006
 They think it's very elite, you know,

00:17:19.178 --> 00:17:22.599
it depends on what you think about what.

00:17:24.201 --> 00:17:30.847
They're proud of it. So I said if we make these things in India,

00:17:30.968 --> 00:17:33.756
these poor people - you know, because there is so much sand,

00:17:33.877 --> 00:17:37.416
and the sand is needed by trucks,

00:17:37.793 --> 00:17:43.253
so I will utilise this to make this beautiful factory here.

00:17:43.488 --> 00:17:52.050
And then give them some support to live well.

00:17:56.526 --> 00:18:01.456
Now, when I went to one place called as Warana

00:18:01.981 --> 00:18:04.329
- you all had come also once -

00:18:04.571 --> 00:18:08.011
 there's a gentleman who was a disciple of Gandhiji

00:18:08.394 --> 00:18:16.378
and he's organised this Warana company for distributing milk.

00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:21.104
It became so very rich, so very rich, it's a co-operative -

00:18:21.386 --> 00:18:27.156
so he started giving money to all the co-operative
people, those who had laboured there.

00:18:27.428 --> 00:18:30.546
Now this labour had never seen that money.

00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:33.057
So he came to Me, touched My feet and he said:

00:18:33.307 --> 00:18:35.878
"Mother, You tell me now, what should I do?

00:18:36.099 --> 00:18:40.862
I'm so unhappy with the development of this Warna

00:18:41.089 --> 00:18:46.315
because there are prostitutes who have arrived from Bombay.

00:18:47.136 --> 00:18:53.214
There are all kinds of hard drinks which have come from Bombay,

00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.190
and these people are smoking like hell, they are taking drugs." "Why?"

00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:08.011
"Yes, wherever there is money the drug goes there.

00:19:09.378 --> 00:19:13.027
And the children are becoming absolutely useless,

00:19:13.214 --> 00:19:18.471
they don't want to study, they will slap their parents."

00:19:19.237 --> 00:19:23.414
So he said, "This was not Gandhiji's idea, now what has happened?"

00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:34.063
He said, "This is a curse of money" and he was crying.

00:19:35.227 --> 00:19:39.336
Now how can Lakshmi become a curse?

00:19:41.688 --> 00:19:48.375
It does, it is in the Nabhi,

00:19:49.539 --> 00:19:52.977
what a central position it has.

00:19:54.086 --> 00:20:02.000
And when this Nabhi starts working

00:20:03.797 --> 00:20:11.790
it is a very remarkable thing, that you feel

00:20:13.711 --> 00:20:21.049
 gobbling the food all the time, with this Nabhi.

00:20:23.773 --> 00:20:27.914
I mean, you go on eating, go on eating like mad,

00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:34.437
and then some bhoot comes in to eat also with you, inside the Nabhi.

00:20:35.414 --> 00:20:42.273
Then you can eat so much that

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:49.398
no human beings can eat like that except for the people who are rich.

00:20:51.593 --> 00:20:58.437
Then you start a big science, or what you can call etiquettes.

00:21:00.804 --> 00:21:03.812
I don't want to hurt anybody,

00:21:04.422 --> 00:21:08.492
I mean if you are eating well I don't mind - eat well.

00:21:09.648 --> 00:21:12.814
But the first part is,

00:21:13.384 --> 00:21:17.073
because today is Diwali I'm trying to tell you

00:21:17.626 --> 00:21:20.533
all these interesting stories.

00:21:23.087 --> 00:21:31.009
I went many a times for dinner with French Diplomats.

00:21:31.345 --> 00:21:36.985
My goodness. Now Me and My husband don't drink.

00:21:37.235 --> 00:21:42.279
So 45 minutes they were only discussing what they will have today.

00:21:42.868 --> 00:21:45.589
Then they remembered yesterday they had that,

00:21:45.847 --> 00:21:50.308
the day before they had that, so there should be variety.

00:21:50.558 --> 00:21:52.651
So then they came down to something,

00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:56.418
not all of them drinking the same, different, different.

00:21:57.097 --> 00:22:02.158
So they came to some point - all right we'll have this,

00:22:02.415 --> 00:22:07.665
but some people asked for something which was not available,

00:22:09.095 --> 00:22:12.721
so they said, "You have to have it" and they shouted at them.

00:22:13.126 --> 00:22:19.866
My goodness, they took 45 minutes to decide
what they are going to drink.

00:22:21.866 --> 00:22:25.938
It's regarded as French etiquettes, I think,

00:22:26.194 --> 00:22:29.841
and we two chief guests, Myself and My husband,

00:22:30.083 --> 00:22:35.198
looking at this man and looking at that woman didn't know what to do

00:22:35.385 --> 00:22:40.727
with these etiquettes, so we were thinking, "Now better go."

00:22:41.283 --> 00:22:43.774
Then it came to food!

00:22:44.618 --> 00:22:52.240
They are so particular: "I like this, and I like that";

00:22:52.506 --> 00:22:56.134
they are worse than Indians, I tell you.

00:22:57.951 --> 00:23:05.443
And they took at least, 80 minutes to decide what they will eat.

00:23:07.155 --> 00:23:12.624
Ultimately they found something nice, each different

00:23:13.186 --> 00:23:18.022
and the restaurant people were trying to pamper their ego,

00:23:18.209 --> 00:23:22.678
"oh what a thing you have chosen - this is the best ..wow wow...."

00:23:25.569 --> 00:23:30.421
So they started serving.

00:23:31.572 --> 00:23:36.533
The cheese was smelling so awful, I tell you,

00:23:39.096 --> 00:23:42.315
we couldn't bear it, you know, both of us.

00:23:43.213 --> 00:23:48.049
So My husband told them, "Today is Our fasting day, for both of Us."

00:23:50.265 --> 00:23:54.616
He said, "Why is it a fasting day?" "In India we have, you know,

00:23:54.843 --> 00:23:58.679
fasting like this, have to fast, today is ours."

00:23:58.897 --> 00:24:02.686
But I told him, "Here one day you are saying 'today is our fasting',

00:24:02.807 --> 00:24:05.379
but We have to go to so many dinners, what will you do?"

00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:09.477
He said, "Everywhere better to say that We are fasting."

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:15.477
Such a horrible cheese they brought, and they started boasting

00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:21.984
that they have 200 types of cheese - wow, wow!

00:24:22.242 --> 00:24:28.130
I said, "200 types - of the smelly ones? From where did you get?"

00:24:32.672 --> 00:24:39.177
They said, "This is French perfection! See this.

00:24:40.146 --> 00:24:43.388
Y said, "What is this  French perfection!"

00:24:44.447 --> 00:24:47.682
But then, you know, tears came into my eyes

00:24:47.939 --> 00:24:50.932
C.P. said, "Why are you crying?" - "Not crying,

00:24:51.197 --> 00:24:55.705
but I think, what will happen to these people with their cheese

00:24:55.986 --> 00:25:00.127
Where will they go? Evan if they go to  Hell

00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:04.650
They will be thrown away with the smell of the cheese!!"

00:25:14.010 --> 00:25:18.377
Then I read how this cheese came in,

00:25:18.799 --> 00:25:25.494
so they said - there was a big snowfall, and they had put some big,

00:25:25.705 --> 00:25:31.799
big containers in a cave, of milk.  And people forgot about it -

00:25:32.025 --> 00:25:34.759
snowfall was there for 20 days, whatever it was,

00:25:34.892 --> 00:25:38.517
and they just forgot about it. So after one year

00:25:38.767 --> 00:25:43.577
they got the smell, you see, coming out of it. So they went

00:25:43.827 --> 00:25:47.561
and saw the cheese being formed - can you imagine?

00:25:48.108 --> 00:25:51.389
This is the beginning of the end.

00:25:52.257 --> 00:25:56.264
Actually one should never eat anything that is

00:25:56.507 --> 00:26:00.991
kept overnight, normally, but now they have got fridges

00:26:01.452 --> 00:26:05.155
so you can keep it for 2 days, 3 days at the most.

00:26:05.444 --> 00:26:09.882
Like on the ship they keep it. But this I couldn't understand that

00:26:10.100 --> 00:26:16.942
this cheese, which is, they told Me, is very old, I said, "Really"?

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.340
And they sell it by that, what old it is.

00:26:20.614 --> 00:26:24.747
And their wines, if they are say 200 years old,

00:26:25.012 --> 00:26:28.317
it is 200 times more expensive.

00:26:29.317 --> 00:26:33.465
So it's such a bhootish thing to eat all that.

00:26:34.395 --> 00:26:38.996
So when the Lakshmi goes into the hands of bhoots

00:26:39.287 --> 00:26:43.763
on a very less level, I should say, is this,

00:26:44.162 --> 00:26:52.162
 then it goes into the heads of people who want to exploit money,

00:26:53.787 --> 00:27:01.131
exploit poor people, exploit countries which are down-trodden -

00:27:01.412 --> 00:27:05.865
- go on like this collecting money you know, looting, looting, looting.

00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:14.048
 When English came to India, we didn't know they used to take bribes.

00:27:14.298 --> 00:27:20.743
On Diwali day if you went there without any present
they say "baksheesh". You must give some present,

00:27:21.001 --> 00:27:25.055
and what they liked was our country liquor. I never knew this,

00:27:25.321 --> 00:27:27.696
but later on I came to know because My husband

00:27:27.907 --> 00:27:30.142
became a collector of Meerut

00:27:30.376 --> 00:27:35.407
- and there were bottles of country liquors  kept in that house

00:27:35.673 --> 00:27:38.501
 and that house was itself more than a hundred years old.

00:27:38.782 --> 00:27:43.240
A long time back it was kept there still, some of them you see,

00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:47.873
and we could have sent them to England to
sell - would have been a good idea.

00:27:48.099 --> 00:27:52.365
So the older it is, it's better.

00:27:54.045 --> 00:27:59.607
This Lakshmi I think becomes old and dies and there is A-Lakshmi.

00:28:00.185 --> 00:28:04.889
A-Lakshmi means when you have money and you don't have the qualities

00:28:05.115 --> 00:28:08.248
of a person who should have money.

00:28:09.021 --> 00:28:14.399
In that quality of A-Lakshmi you become very miserly,

00:28:14.634 --> 00:28:18.173
you don't even want to help your brothers and sisters,

00:28:18.431 --> 00:28:22.993
you don't want to give any money to anyone. And even if you give it,

00:28:23.259 --> 00:28:27.743
you give it to false gurus and wrong things.

00:28:28.250 --> 00:28:32.110
This is up to, we can say, is A-Lakshmi,

00:28:32.352 --> 00:28:36.230
the behaviour becomes very arrogant.

00:28:36.729 --> 00:28:41.182
So arrogant that you behave like horses, you know.

00:28:41.432 --> 00:28:45.808
People look like horses, they walk like horses -

00:28:46.089 --> 00:28:49.309
- but I don't know if the horses have ego.

00:28:49.574 --> 00:28:53.207
If you see these people you just don't understand

00:28:53.457 --> 00:28:56.675
what's gone wrong with them, you see.

00:28:57.191 --> 00:29:02.167
There was one gentleman who started an aeroplane business,

00:29:02.386 --> 00:29:06.972
aeroplane business in India. I won't take his name,

00:29:07.308 --> 00:29:13.855
but say some Majidhia or someone. And My granddaughter met him

00:29:14.112 --> 00:29:17.761
with My grandson-in-law,

00:29:18.159 --> 00:29:21.813
and they were walking like this, talking like this,

00:29:22.047 --> 00:29:25.151
you see, they can't understand these two persons.

00:29:25.433 --> 00:29:30.682
So, they came and talked to them, who you are and all.

00:29:30.932 --> 00:29:35.939
And then they said, "We are this Majidhia."

00:29:37.689 --> 00:29:43.064
So My granddaughter said, "Who is Majidhia?"

00:29:43.291 --> 00:29:47.033
My goodness, they fell from heavens,

00:29:47.299 --> 00:29:52.104
"You don't know who are Majidhias! Do you read newspapers or not?"

00:29:52.439 --> 00:29:59.611
Then her husband came in. He said, "I do. Now what do you want to say?"

00:30:00.049 --> 00:30:04.291
 "We are Majidiyas!" He said, "Who are Majidhias?" "You don't know?

00:30:04.572 --> 00:30:10.588
What sort of business you do, what is this?"

00:30:11.127 --> 00:30:16.963
Such stupid things they did that these children felt that there's no use

00:30:17.213 --> 00:30:21.710
having any business, if business means this kind of behaviour.

00:30:21.939 --> 00:30:29.913
Very indecent, very arrogant, they don't know how to relate to people,

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:35.647
they don't know. And after some time I heard that their business

00:30:35.874 --> 00:30:40.725
was completely finished - it was a flop they call it, flop.

00:30:42.264 --> 00:30:46.835
So now, we have to realise that this Lakshmi,

00:30:47.194 --> 00:30:51.460
how it takes us to wrong things.

00:30:54.202 --> 00:31:01.358
Firstly, She makes you very egoistical.

00:31:02.554 --> 00:31:08.436
Somehow. When a man who has money starts behaving like that

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:19.014
We cannot understand how a person who was normal,

00:31:19.253 --> 00:31:23.113
suddenly becomes like this, starts talking like this.

00:31:23.441 --> 00:31:28.090
He might earn money even in the horse races.

00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:36.879
Around the Lakshmi is the valency of Dharma.

00:31:39.183 --> 00:31:43.863
There is - around the Lakshmi - is the Dharma.

00:31:45.202 --> 00:31:49.843
And this Dharma if you cross

00:31:50.077 --> 00:31:54.999
that's the best place where they can cross, the Dharma.

00:31:55.702 --> 00:32:01.546
Then you can do whatever you like which is Adharmic,

00:32:02.101 --> 00:32:06.234
which is irreligious, which is hideous.

00:32:09.351 --> 00:32:12.773
You have to just cross that limit of Dharma,

00:32:13.249 --> 00:32:18.999
you have to just deviate from Dharma.

00:32:20.359 --> 00:32:26.257
Now as I have said on many a times that there are
ten valencies human beings have got.

00:32:26.796 --> 00:32:31.249
But apart from that, there are many Dharmas

00:32:31.507 --> 00:32:35.515
which are surrounding us - like angels.

00:32:36.726 --> 00:32:41.390
Like first Dharma is

00:32:42.296 --> 00:32:46.890
your Love for humanity, is the first Dharma.

00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:52.380
But if you say from that end when you start,

00:32:52.654 --> 00:32:57.989
it starts with Sree Dharma, is the Dharma

00:32:59.951 --> 00:33:03.895
Is the Dharma of the woman,

00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:08.364
how she should live, how she should get married,

00:33:08.638 --> 00:33:13.738
how she should look after her children, what should be her behaviour,

00:33:13.966 --> 00:33:20.129
all is Sree Dharma. And then is Patni Dharma,

00:33:20.488 --> 00:33:24.824
is the wife, wife's Dharma, what should be her Dharma?

00:33:25.043 --> 00:33:29.231
In her Dharma she looks nice, if she gives up her Dharma

00:33:29.418 --> 00:33:32.558
then she is a prostitute.

00:33:33.933 --> 00:33:40.144
So then is Pathi Dharma, how should be a husband.

00:33:40.707 --> 00:33:45.433
How should he behave towards his family, how should he pay attention

00:33:45.636 --> 00:33:50.950
towards his wife, about the whole, entire family, the whole,

00:33:51.200 --> 00:33:52.606
- you can say -

00:33:52.879 --> 00:33:57.083
Parivara they call it the whole, all the relations and everyone.

00:33:57.434 --> 00:34:02.504
That is the wisdom But beyond that is

00:34:02.887 --> 00:34:10.887
 the Dharma of Satya Dharma, how much he sticks to truth.

00:34:12.533 --> 00:34:17.529
Then the Dharma for Creativity.

00:34:17.787 --> 00:34:21.280
In creativity as you know very well these days,  with money

00:34:21.425 --> 00:34:23.941
people are standing on their heads or I don't know how,

00:34:24.092 --> 00:34:28.186
what they are doing, because the amount of nonsense they are producing

00:34:28.436 --> 00:34:31.225
all over the world in the name of modernism,

00:34:31.436 --> 00:34:35.467
is no way is Khala Dharma, no way.

00:34:36.928 --> 00:34:44.409
Then we have also what you call politics, Rajkaran Dharma.

00:34:44.944 --> 00:34:50.288
This [also] Dharma is there. Now, taking bribes,

00:34:50.491 --> 00:34:55.053
I mean, the kind of things that are going on, corruption,

00:34:55.326 --> 00:34:59.701
all kinds of things that are going on, competition and fighting

00:34:59.966 --> 00:35:07.217
and all that. They are falling from their Dharma of Rajkaran.

00:35:08.006 --> 00:35:13.467
Education same thing, we call it as Shikhshada - Shikhshada.

00:35:14.701 --> 00:35:18.225
All such things are dharmas,

00:35:18.552 --> 00:35:24.630
there's a kind of a principle which we have to keep,

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:30.428
otherwise you can topple down from the Lotus

00:35:31.693 --> 00:35:36.904
and that's what happens. Now we have also Rashtra Dharma.

00:35:38.318 --> 00:35:42.756
The Rashtra Dharma is that your country, you must,

00:35:42.959 --> 00:35:45.303
their's a Dharma of your Rashtra.

00:35:45.584 --> 00:35:49.498
When you have to fight for your country you should,

00:35:49.717 --> 00:35:52.654
but you should not be aggressive on other countries,

00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:55.427
not try to dominate other countries,

00:35:55.646 --> 00:36:00.076
nor you should bring bad name to your country.

00:36:01.231 --> 00:36:03.276
It's very important.

00:36:03.502 --> 00:36:09.393
Sahaja Yogis have all these intact, absolutely,

00:36:09.683 --> 00:36:14.316
because you arestanding on the lotuses already.

00:36:14.658 --> 00:36:18.089
You don't have this problem, normally not.

00:36:18.407 --> 00:36:24.311
Once in a while there are people who behave like that, but mostly

00:36:24.525 --> 00:36:28.033
Sahaja Yogis don't fall into these traps.

00:36:28.421 --> 00:36:31.874
That's why their Lakshmi tattwa will definitely improve.

00:36:32.163 --> 00:36:35.264
They'll have little problems here and there,

00:36:35.983 --> 00:36:41.225
but without problems if you get Lakshmi you'll not have value for Her.

00:36:42.014 --> 00:36:45.499
So with little problems you get the Lakshmi.

00:36:45.811 --> 00:36:52.600
But Lakshmi it doesn't give you all this imbalance.

00:36:52.895 --> 00:36:57.333
Such a man has to be extremely balanced

00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.833
because beyond that is the step of Mahalakshmi,

00:37:03.668 --> 00:37:11.433
where your seeking starts, where you become a seeker. You go beyond

00:37:12.542 --> 00:37:20.503
Lakshmi principle and this Mahalakshmi principle starts coming into you.

00:37:21.417 --> 00:37:26.012
I would say in the western countries this consumerism has started

00:37:26.535 --> 00:37:32.355
and it's such a funny one. In America one lady was married to an Indian

00:37:32.581 --> 00:37:37.738
and he used to tell Me how this consumerism works.

00:37:38.285 --> 00:37:42.480
I said, "How?" He said, "I gave my wife money to buy

00:37:42.691 --> 00:37:45.216
two shirts for me becauseI had no shirts.

00:37:45.449 --> 00:37:49.355
So she went and bought five skirts.

00:37:50.028 --> 00:37:53.090
So I said, "You have so many skirts, why did you buy the skirts?"

00:37:53.316 --> 00:37:58.739
"Because with this money I could buy five skirts instead of two shirts,

00:37:59.085 --> 00:38:05.109
so I bought five skirts". So he said "I can't wear skirts.

00:38:06.803 --> 00:38:09.851
So how should I correct her?", he said.

00:38:10.070 --> 00:38:13.366
I said, "You do one thing: tell her I want to buy some skirts for you,

00:38:13.624 --> 00:38:16.921
and go and buy five shirts".

00:38:17.865 --> 00:38:20.600
Then she will realise that

00:38:20.866 --> 00:38:24.045
if the money was given to her for one purpose,

00:38:24.248 --> 00:38:25.913
it should be used for that.

00:38:26.133 --> 00:38:30.422
This is a very subtle principle which I follow because

00:38:30.617 --> 00:38:32.945
I don't understand money.

00:38:33.155 --> 00:38:36.531
So what I do - whatever money I get I put packets.

00:38:36.789 --> 00:38:40.875
This is for this, this is for this, this is for this - into packets.

00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:44.711
But I don't understand you know and I don't write accounts, you know.

00:38:44.930 --> 00:38:48.186
I'm very bad at all that, somebody else does that.

00:38:48.436 --> 00:38:53.803
Now, if I spend some money from one pocket for some emergency,

00:38:54.295 --> 00:38:59.031
then I again fill it back, it's written there,
so much is there, so much is there.

00:38:59.795 --> 00:39:04.193
So the money is available at the right time for whatever I want to do,

00:39:04.465 --> 00:39:08.021
and the money is in the packet. It is,

00:39:08.284 --> 00:39:15.441
not in the, sort of a open thing, that I can just want to buy

00:39:15.644 --> 00:39:18.894
a Mercedes, I want to buy a Rolls Royce, no, nothing doing,

00:39:19.104 --> 00:39:22.136
it is for something, some purpose,

00:39:23.503 --> 00:39:29.120
and there is no need. So when you go to the shop

00:39:29.729 --> 00:39:33.972
and you see something you won't buy it because that money

00:39:34.205 --> 00:39:37.315
is not kept for that particular thing.

00:39:37.784 --> 00:39:43.112
For Sahaja Yogis it's very easy to handle their money with respect.

00:39:43.901 --> 00:39:46.440
So you go to any shop,

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:53.930
you won't buy anything. But My nature also is spontaneous.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:57.703
So I went to Frankfurt changing,

00:39:57.961 --> 00:40:00.586
they said, "Mother, there's a very nice watch shop".

00:40:00.843 --> 00:40:04.039
I just thought I'm going to get three son-in-laws,

00:40:04.234 --> 00:40:08.343
and what will I give them. So I went to that shop

00:40:08.586 --> 00:40:13.429
and I found such beautiful, beautiful things,

00:40:13.454 --> 00:40:19.329
but I had not kept any money for the watch. But I said, "I must buy."

00:40:19.804 --> 00:40:23.771
One of the watches turned out to be a very unique one,

00:40:23.989 --> 00:40:30.005
and I must tell you, which is no more available. Because of My eyes,

00:40:30.724 --> 00:40:36.935
I saw this is thamting unic and My son-in-law
is so, I mean, overwhelmed,

00:40:37.786 --> 00:40:40.755
so overwhelmed, he's quite rich, he has no problems,

00:40:40.974 --> 00:40:45.005
but he said, "This watch you cannot get."

00:40:45.224 --> 00:40:48.591
Then an article came about that particular watch,

00:40:48.818 --> 00:40:55.722
so he's kept it with him. You see, so to have something - it should

00:40:55.916 --> 00:41:00.900
have a value behind it, that is the Dharma part,

00:41:01.792 --> 00:41:04.968
value behind it. What is the value?

00:41:06.554 --> 00:41:09.898
When you want to buy something just don't buy because

00:41:10.124 --> 00:41:15.484
you are mad, I mean instead of shirts you buy skirts, not that way.

00:41:15.773 --> 00:41:20.038
But anything that has an artistic value

00:41:20.553 --> 00:41:25.804
or some special value - then you should buy that.

00:41:26.483 --> 00:41:29.374
Now this Sari I'm wearing

00:41:31.843 --> 00:41:37.968
- it has a special value, why? Not that it is made with hands,

00:41:38.749 --> 00:41:46.749
is a very beautiful design it has, no. This was made

00:41:46.957 --> 00:41:50.355
in a place called Paithan,

00:41:51.637 --> 00:41:59.480
which was the capital

00:42:00.519 --> 00:42:09.597
of a kingdom, which belonged to My forefathers Shalivahanas.

00:42:10.199 --> 00:42:13.988
 And these Saris were made there, Paithan

00:42:14.926 --> 00:42:18.285
and they used to sell it to people. Now they have become expensive,

00:42:18.511 --> 00:42:24.556
in those days they were cheap. Now it has that value.

00:42:24.961 --> 00:42:29.625
They're very honest, very religious, they were called Shalivahanas,

00:42:29.853 --> 00:42:33.126
because they used to give shawl to the Goddess.

00:42:34.985 --> 00:42:37.930
They spread their kingdom very much and also

00:42:38.157 --> 00:42:40.775
there is a calendar in their name.

00:42:41.125 --> 00:42:44.383
But the kind of life they led.

00:42:44.803 --> 00:42:47.540
They were just very generous people

00:42:47.711 --> 00:42:51.415
and they have made beautiful temples,

00:42:52.055 --> 00:42:57.625
beautiful places for people to rest near the river,

00:42:58.449 --> 00:43:01.532
I mean so many beautiful things they have done.

00:43:01.878 --> 00:43:07.477
Apart from that, Rama and Sita when they went to Dhandakharana

00:43:07.672 --> 00:43:11.302
 they went to this place and you have the place

00:43:11.857 --> 00:43:16.583
and you have the place where Sita took Her bath

00:43:17.091 --> 00:43:22.396
- Her bathing place, there's a little river flowing there.

00:43:23.372 --> 00:43:27.896
And how it was covered from all the sides and how the light was coming,

00:43:28.106 --> 00:43:31.871
so beautiful. But whatever Rama had done

00:43:32.075 --> 00:43:36.887
they redecorated it with the Rajput style art.

00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:45.325
Then also there was a very beautiful temple I saw that they had made.

00:43:45.551 --> 00:43:48.621
Also I don't know how there was some water flowing.

00:43:49.386 --> 00:43:57.214
And there was Shri Mahadeva's, a big thing, Pindha - very big.

00:43:58.512 --> 00:44:05.362
And also there was a Parvati's statue,

00:44:05.604 --> 00:44:13.378
so old as that. I don't know if it was put by Rama or by these days,

00:44:13.562 --> 00:44:20.664
My own - you can call them, the grand, great, great grandparents.

00:44:21.038 --> 00:44:25.229
But the beauty about that place that it shows

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:30.789
that Sita used to worship Mahadeva.

00:44:32.237 --> 00:44:37.830
The water was flowing somehow by nature, inside up there

00:44:38.198 --> 00:44:44.955
in a stream, and She used to take the water and put it on that Pindha.

00:44:46.252 --> 00:44:52.182
How deep these people were, those who built that temple.

00:44:52.698 --> 00:44:56.533
Such a beautiful temple they have built.

00:44:57.157 --> 00:45:00.399
See so many temples are built like this in India,

00:45:00.618 --> 00:45:06.907
by people who had money, and they believed that if you

00:45:07.258 --> 00:45:13.291
spend your money in this kind of work you are blessed.

00:45:14.305 --> 00:45:22.056
I bought a land near the River Neera, that's My home name, Neera.

00:45:22.427 --> 00:45:27.076
And this land, I just bought it just like that without thinking.

00:45:27.731 --> 00:45:34.255
And what they told that their Guru - Shalivahanas - Guru was Shandilya

00:45:34.646 --> 00:45:39.646
and this place belonged to him long

00:45:39.865 --> 00:45:45.443
time back, which was an ashram of Shandilya - exactly the same.

00:45:47.654 --> 00:45:52.411
And that land I bought very surprisingly,

00:45:52.661 --> 00:45:56.478
then in the newspaper it came out everything about that land,

00:45:56.744 --> 00:46:03.164
and this land was the place where

00:46:03.382 --> 00:46:09.280
a great devotee of Shri Vishnu, Pralahda, was praying.

00:46:09.999 --> 00:46:16.484
So you must have heard about Pralahda. His mother

00:46:18.093 --> 00:46:21.038
had a husband, in a long time,

00:46:21.319 --> 00:46:24.265
Hiranyakashapu was her husband, a horrible rakshasa.

00:46:24.804 --> 00:46:29.094
So she ran away from there and who helped was Indra.

00:46:29.469 --> 00:46:37.465
He brought this lady to the place of Guru Shandilya

00:46:39.769 --> 00:46:43.246
and Shandilya told Him,

00:46:43.613 --> 00:46:47.801
Indra that, "You don't put any effort for her, I'll look after her,

00:46:48.168 --> 00:46:51.551
and the child that is going to be born to this lady

00:46:51.762 --> 00:46:56.535
is going to get the Avatara of Narasimha"

00:46:57.309 --> 00:47:03.176
- you know Narasimha is the man and the lion.

00:47:04.659 --> 00:47:07.928
He said, "How can that be?" He said, "It is so."

00:47:08.152 --> 00:47:13.099
So Indra left her there, the child was born, till 5 years that child

00:47:13.310 --> 00:47:16.349
used to play in that land which I have bought.

00:47:16.573 --> 00:47:19.927
But I didn't know about it, but I just saw it,

00:47:20.161 --> 00:47:23.629
I was surprised. But when the child grew up

00:47:23.815 --> 00:47:27.294
after 5 years he had to go back to his father.

00:47:27.528 --> 00:47:30.590
I don't know how many of you read about Pralahda,

00:47:30.816 --> 00:47:33.465
raise your hands, I would like to know.

00:47:35.639 --> 00:47:42.827
The little boy Pralahd, let me see, who was killed and,

00:47:43.053 --> 00:47:48.405
I mean, his father tried to kill him and torture him,

00:47:48.686 --> 00:47:55.717
but he had certain boons so Shri Vishnu appeared as

00:47:58.014 --> 00:48:03.654
Narasimha, means the lion and the human form.

00:48:04.162 --> 00:48:09.077
And then he killed this Hiranyakashapu, the father.

00:48:10.061 --> 00:48:17.638
Now imagine, how much - big it was, that thousands of years back

00:48:18.507 --> 00:48:24.742
this must have happened, and that I should purchase that land only.

00:48:25.334 --> 00:48:29.848
And there is a very beautiful temple built about 300 years back

00:48:30.106 --> 00:48:35.341
by Maharashtrians. So the story is

00:48:35.716 --> 00:48:39.557
that Pralahda came into the dream of the people who wanted to build

00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:45.526
the temple and told them that, "I have already made the statue

00:48:45.753 --> 00:48:48.885
of Narasimha along the river Neera",

00:48:49.104 --> 00:48:51.950
- imagine the name of the river is also Mine -

00:48:52.153 --> 00:48:59.246
"and if you can walk along the banks of Neera river very close

00:48:59.442 --> 00:49:04.645
to the temple, I have made the statue in sand."

00:49:07.129 --> 00:49:13.738
It's a miracle, so when there they went there  and they saw that statue,

00:49:14.371 --> 00:49:19.387
they brought it back and installed it in that temple,

00:49:20.738 --> 00:49:25.551
and it's still there, made of sand.

00:49:26.043 --> 00:49:32.616
Also they say there's a kind of a river or a water flow up to,

00:49:32.879 --> 00:49:35.535
very small one just like the finger,

00:49:35.785 --> 00:49:39.074
flows down from the top, God knows how.

00:49:40.511 --> 00:49:44.808
So, now see the value,

00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:52.379
the value of money which was collected to build this temple

00:49:52.582 --> 00:49:57.488
had such an old value.

00:49:59.902 --> 00:50:06.535
So the value is not money - this one should understand.

00:50:08.496 --> 00:50:12.137
What is the value of the thing?

00:50:13.621 --> 00:50:18.738
You want to give to something to others, then

00:50:19.512 --> 00:50:24.097
the feelings you have in your heart is the value,

00:50:24.277 --> 00:50:28.004
and that value is the real Lakshmi.

00:50:31.722 --> 00:50:36.781
When you are, say, building a house,

00:50:38.976 --> 00:50:42.609
the plans you make and things you do,

00:50:43.648 --> 00:50:51.153
what is the idea behind and what you are trying to express

00:50:51.372 --> 00:50:55.700
through that house is the value of that house.

00:50:58.824 --> 00:51:06.415
Once you understand that you have to buy, with this Lakshmi,

00:51:06.915 --> 00:51:11.704
or you have to use this Lakshmi for certain value,

00:51:11.915 --> 00:51:16.601
and not for showing off or for money.

00:51:20.453 --> 00:51:26.687
This superficialness that we have about money itself

00:51:26.992 --> 00:51:33.382
is like an ordinary glass, but if you put behind the glass

00:51:33.632 --> 00:51:39.289
the mercury, you can see the value.

00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:47.445
So when you start buying something, what is the purpose,

00:51:47.944 --> 00:51:52.867
why are you buying it - this will determine the value.

00:51:53.882 --> 00:51:57.075
Like, last time I came to Portugal

00:51:57.765 --> 00:52:02.742
and I said: "This year we'll go and buy some Terracotta",

00:52:02.968 --> 00:52:08.670
but they are very expensive. I said, "This is the price",

00:52:08.922 --> 00:52:12.194
but I wanted to buy Terracotta from Portugal, because

00:52:12.381 --> 00:52:16.772
it's very rich in that. So we went to one factory,

00:52:17.763 --> 00:52:21.780
and the factory was quite far out, none of them could find out,

00:52:21.952 --> 00:52:25.311
but I told them, "It's here only just go and see."

00:52:26.725 --> 00:52:32.686
And then we bought the Terracotta. But on our way I told,

00:52:34.132 --> 00:52:40.217
"Stop, stop here, stop." So they stopped, there was a shop.

00:52:40.631 --> 00:52:45.155
I had to buy some things for Sahaja Yogis in India,

00:52:46.467 --> 00:52:49.515
and also for some people in Cabella.

00:52:49.897 --> 00:52:53.312
And that shop had such beautiful cottons.

00:52:54.772 --> 00:52:59.991
They were Sahaja Yogis from here who saw it, such beautiful clothes

00:53:00.452 --> 00:53:04.997
and I bought lot of it. I said, "Thank God the problem

00:53:05.231 --> 00:53:11.022
presents are finished now for India." So joy-giving it was,

00:53:11.225 --> 00:53:14.335
everybody was surprised - why, suddenly in a

00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:19.038
place where never had been Mother there, suddenly She finds them.

00:53:21.155 --> 00:53:25.546
It has a value, because I wanted to buy something

00:53:25.804 --> 00:53:28.843
for Indians to be given as present.

00:53:29.967 --> 00:53:35.062
So if your Lakshmi is, say, this much,

00:53:35.522 --> 00:53:39.663
once you add to it value it becomes so big.

00:53:42.357 --> 00:53:47.858
The sign of a person who is Lakshmipathi is this -

00:53:48.256 --> 00:53:53.569
he should have a house like the lotus in the hands

00:53:53.819 --> 00:54:01.319
of the Goddess, he should protect people who are depending on him,

00:54:02.077 --> 00:54:06.616
and from the left hand he should give.

00:54:08.216 --> 00:54:11.342
This is the image of the Lakshmi.

00:54:12.327 --> 00:54:15.655
This is what the Lakshmi is within you,

00:54:15.881 --> 00:54:19.850
if you have these four things in balance,

00:54:20.842 --> 00:54:23.710
without conditioning, without ego,

00:54:23.936 --> 00:54:29.155
then you are a Sahaja Yogi - otherwise you are not.

00:54:31.546 --> 00:54:38.257
On a Diwali day we have to promise ourselves that whatever

00:54:38.632 --> 00:54:42.108
we are going to get now as Lakshmi principle

00:54:42.304 --> 00:54:47.826
or as a Lakshmi's prasad should be used

00:54:49.264 --> 00:54:53.616
in getting things which has value.

00:54:58.303 --> 00:55:03.475
And thus you will learn that you have used your Lakshmi very well,

00:55:03.717 --> 00:55:08.561
and with that your and with that your Mahalakshmi
principle become very strong.

00:55:09.552 --> 00:55:14.271
Will become very strong by which you'll ascend very fast.

00:55:16.261 --> 00:55:21.925
Today is the day for us to celebrate the Lakshmi Puja,

00:55:22.696 --> 00:55:27.243
but Lakshmi Puja doesn't mean that

00:55:28.321 --> 00:55:35.055
you worship money. Money as it is, is the most dangerous thing,

00:55:35.673 --> 00:55:42.461
and I think it is the hidden weapon of Lakshmi Devi.

00:55:43.446 --> 00:55:49.446
See, if you try to misuse Her, She goes on punching with it.

00:55:50.264 --> 00:55:55.866
With when one punch if you don't realise
then She gives you another punch, like that.

00:55:56.069 --> 00:56:03.302
Then She might little bit twist you, to suggest. She'll try everything,

00:56:03.488 --> 00:56:06.872
to convince you that what you are doing is nonsense -

00:56:07.114 --> 00:56:12.520
ultimately She sees your destruction completely.

00:56:13.755 --> 00:56:19.005
So, Lakshmi, though She is the one who is a giver of boons,

00:56:19.551 --> 00:56:21.924
giver of everything,

00:56:22.525 --> 00:56:27.861
you should not be mislead by her Mahamaya character.

00:56:28.135 --> 00:56:33.648
I'm your Mother so I better tell you to be very careful.

00:56:33.929 --> 00:56:35.273
Thank you very much!
