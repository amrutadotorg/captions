1
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:07,070
Can we start with Your childhood?

2
00:07:07,156 --> 00:07:09,338
-Yes.
- Do You, can describe a little bit

3
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:12,855
the circumstances where you were grown up?

4
00:07:13,056 --> 00:07:16,319
- My family?
- Yes.

5
00:07:20,657 --> 00:07:27,127
I belong to a family of very enlightened people.

6
00:07:27,328 --> 00:07:31,956
My father was a linguist

7
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:35,050
and he was master of fourteen languages.

8
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:38,363
He knew about twenty-six languages

9
00:07:38,564 --> 00:07:45,663
and he translated even Koran-e-Sharif into Hindi language.

10
00:07:45,864 --> 00:07:51,116
My Mother was in those days

11
00:07:51,317 --> 00:07:55,237
was a honors in mathematics.

12
00:07:55,438 --> 00:08:01,696
So both were very well educated and enlightened people.

13
00:08:05,317 --> 00:08:09,595
At the time of My birth,

14
00:08:09,896 --> 00:08:12,777
My mother dreamt

15
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:16,364
something which she could not explain,

16
00:08:16,565 --> 00:08:20,749
but after that she had a great desire to go and see a tiger

17
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,495
in the open field.

18
00:08:23,696 --> 00:08:26,109
My father was a great hunter,

19
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:30,015
because tigers were a menace in the area where we were living.

20
00:08:30,216 --> 00:08:34,488
It was a hill station called Chhindwara.

21
00:08:34,689 --> 00:08:38,656
So there was a king who was very much interested in My father.

22
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:40,997
Somehow or the other a letter came that

23
00:08:41,198 --> 00:08:45,145
there’s a tiger, a very big tiger that has appeared

24
00:08:45,346 --> 00:08:49,609
and they are frightened of him that he might be a man-eater.

25
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:55,608
So My father took My Mother and Me to that place.

26
00:08:56,295 --> 00:08:59,251
And they were sitting what we call as a machhan,

27
00:08:59,452 --> 00:09:05,168
where they built something, for people to sit on top of a tree,

28
00:09:05,369 --> 00:09:09,193
from where they can shoot nicely.

29
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:14,091
And then My mother tells Me that a big huge tiger

30
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:19,988
of a very big size, very beautifully appeared on the field.

31
00:09:20,189 --> 00:09:23,879
And she felt tremendous love for the tiger.

32
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:29,718
It was a full moon day and she felt

33
00:09:30,688 --> 00:09:34,098
extremely compassionate towards the tiger.

34
00:09:34,299 --> 00:09:37,285
And when My father raised his gun to shoot,

35
00:09:37,486 --> 00:09:40,022
she stopped him and she wouldn’t allow him.

36
00:09:40,223 --> 00:09:45,215
And the tiger went away and he never came to that forest again.

37
00:09:46,146 --> 00:09:48,597
But that made My father think -

38
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:51,719
because he himself was a realized soul -

39
00:09:51,846 --> 00:09:56,032
that must be somebody,

40
00:09:56,233 --> 00:10:01,712
what we call a Goddess Durga who is fond of  a tiger

41
00:10:01,913 --> 00:10:05,237
must be born to My mother,

42
00:10:05,342 --> 00:10:08,014
because the symptoms were rather funny

43
00:10:08,215 --> 00:10:10,964
that a lady should like to see a tiger and all.

44
00:10:11,165 --> 00:10:13,461
So he told My mother, “Now are you satisfied?”

45
00:10:13,662 --> 00:10:15,401
because they were struggling with the gun.

46
00:10:15,528 --> 00:10:18,352
He said, “Is there a Durga sitting in your womb

47
00:10:18,553 --> 00:10:21,981
that you are trying to protect the tiger?”

48
00:10:22,182 --> 00:10:25,821
She said, “Yes, yes, so stop it now. I won’t allow you.”

49
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:28,701
Like that there were many incidents in My life

50
00:10:28,902 --> 00:10:33,813
because I am of a Christian family – protestants –

51
00:10:34,014 --> 00:10:37,474
and when I was born My mother didn’t feel any labor pains or anything

52
00:10:37,675 --> 00:10:40,147
and just I was born; she didn’t know how.

53
00:10:40,419 --> 00:10:44,714
And I had no blood on My body, nothing, I was clean washed.

54
00:10:44,915 --> 00:10:48,227
That’s why they called My name as Nirmala.

55
00:10:49,235 --> 00:10:54,052
But My grandmother said that She should be called as Nishkalanka,

56
00:10:54,271 --> 00:10:56,554
that means the one which has no spots on it.

57
00:10:56,755 --> 00:10:58,731
But that’s the name of man.

58
00:10:58,932 --> 00:11:00,871
So they said, “All right, we'll call Her Nirmala

59
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:03,632
meaning the same, Immaculata.”

60
00:11:04,895 --> 00:11:08,908
Now all these incidents, and then My Father being a realized soul,

61
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:12,326
he felt tremendous vibrations from Me,

62
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:15,997
and he felt that this life is great

63
00:11:16,182 --> 00:11:21,526
and She will do something great in this life.

64
00:11:22,153 --> 00:11:23,724
I do not know why, but

65
00:11:23,925 --> 00:11:27,214
I don’t know if he dreamt or he understood it, but

66
00:11:27,415 --> 00:11:30,309
all the time if I remember when he talked to Me,

67
00:11:30,510 --> 00:11:33,629
he used to say that, "You have to find out a way

68
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:37,906
of giving en masse Realization, all the time".

69
00:11:38,107 --> 00:11:41,635
As I told you, he was a great scholar of so many things,

70
00:11:41,836 --> 00:11:44,795
and a very widely read man.

71
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:49,802
So he gave Me a good education in religion,

72
00:11:50,003 --> 00:11:51,807
in different religions,

73
00:11:52,008 --> 00:11:55,224
and also good education about human beings,

74
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,146
what are their problems,

75
00:11:57,347 --> 00:12:00,491
why they react like this, why don’t they take to God,

76
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:02,520
why are they hypocritical.

77
00:12:02,803 --> 00:12:05,583
All kinds of things he talked to Me.

78
00:12:05,811 --> 00:12:08,920
He also knew about Kundalini, but not so much.

79
00:12:09,444 --> 00:12:12,323
Of course, when I was born

80
00:12:12,524 --> 00:12:15,607
I knew about Kundalini myself.

81
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:18,099
I knew all about it from My very childhood.

82
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,361
I was a very aware person, extremely aware.

83
00:12:21,562 --> 00:12:22,985
But I didn’t know whom to talk to

84
00:12:23,186 --> 00:12:25,527
because, see, people didn’t have that awareness.

85
00:12:25,728 --> 00:12:28,200
You can’t talk to everyone like that.

86
00:12:28,401 --> 00:12:30,719
So I was regarded as a very jolly person,

87
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:35,407
at the same time very serious also, very deep,

88
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:39,344
and then I started my studies as a child.

89
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,764
I was not very much interested

90
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:45,761
in the studies but I used to do very well,

91
00:12:45,962 --> 00:12:50,124
but I used to read lives of great men and things like that.

92
00:12:50,325 --> 00:12:53,791
At a very young age I read Bernard Shaw.

93
00:12:53,992 --> 00:12:56,472
When people were reading just Great Expectations,

94
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:58,870
I was reading Bernard Shaw.

95
00:12:59,071 --> 00:13:02,574
But as such I didn’t have interest in particularly reading

96
00:13:02,788 --> 00:13:05,555
some text books because I thought they were childish,

97
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:08,762
and there is nothing to be read about it.

98
00:13:08,963 --> 00:13:11,323
Then I told My father that “I have to do medicine.”

99
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,741
So he said, “Why?” I said, “Because I have to talk to doctors.”

100
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:17,910
He said, “You have to talk to doctors?” “Yes”, I said.

101
00:13:18,111 --> 00:13:20,317
But it so happened in My childhood

102
00:13:20,518 --> 00:13:23,245
when I was about seven years of age,

103
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,349
My father was a congressman,

104
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,571
he had joined Congress when I was four years of age.

105
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,140
He used to live with a style, very westernized.

106
00:13:31,341 --> 00:13:33,982
His clothes were stitched in London, sort of a man.

107
00:13:34,509 --> 00:13:36,225
We had governesses and all that.

108
00:13:36,426 --> 00:13:40,114
He threw away everything and he became a real Indian

109
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:44,285
and started leading a life of a martyr.

110
00:13:45,865 --> 00:13:50,696
Then he made us study our languages, Sanskrit...

111
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,871
He made Me study in an Indian school, not in a missionary school,

112
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:57,239
because missionaries were very unkind.

113
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,326
They threw us out of the school when My father was in the Congress.

114
00:14:00,527 --> 00:14:03,040
They were against us completely.

115
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:08,733
Then at the age of seven years I happened to go with My Father

116
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,293
to Mahatma Gandhi.

117
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:14,913
He was about seventy miles, living with us,

118
00:14:15,114 --> 00:14:17,209
but the first time he took Me down.

119
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,000
And Mahatma Gandhi liked Me very much.

120
00:14:19,201 --> 00:14:21,366
He said, “Leave this child with me.”

121
00:14:21,567 --> 00:14:24,349
So, I had not even taken clothes or anything. I stayed on;

122
00:14:24,612 --> 00:14:29,618
then My Father sent Me everything with him.

123
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:33,042
And he was very fond of Me, but I was a little girl,

124
00:14:33,243 --> 00:14:35,783
but he understood that there was something about Me.

125
00:14:35,984 --> 00:14:40,884
He consulted Me on very serious problems sometimes, surprisingly.

126
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,493
Like one day he wanted to

127
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:46,527
make the Prayer Book all right.

128
00:14:46,892 --> 00:14:50,104
So, he asked Me, “How should I put the series?” and all that.

129
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:52,702
So I told him how to put the series

130
00:14:52,903 --> 00:14:55,645
and he put the series in that way.

131
00:14:55,846 --> 00:15:00,364
I used to go back for My school and again go back to Gandhiji,

132
00:15:00,565 --> 00:15:04,469
every year, like that. And he called Me Nepali.

133
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,345
He'd given Me a name Nepali.

134
00:15:06,546 --> 00:15:09,391
Everybody used to call Me Nepali that time.

135
00:15:10,028 --> 00:15:14,205
Then I grew up with him very intimately.

136
00:15:14,406 --> 00:15:16,841
He was a very, very kind person for children,

137
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,112
otherwise an extremely strict man,

138
00:15:19,313 --> 00:15:23,545
with himself and with others, very strict, a big disciplinarian.

139
00:15:23,746 --> 00:15:27,290
And he would make everybody get up at four o’clock,

140
00:15:27,491 --> 00:15:31,116
have your baths, everything, be ready for your morning prayers

141
00:15:31,317 --> 00:15:33,603
at five o’clock, you see, and he used to walk very fast.

142
00:15:33,804 --> 00:15:35,557
I also learnt walking fast with him.

143
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:38,420
In his company I had to walk fast.

144
00:15:38,669 --> 00:15:42,312
And he was extremely loving and a very nice person,

145
00:15:42,513 --> 00:15:45,240
and he would listen to Me because I was a child, you see.

146
00:15:45,441 --> 00:15:47,481
Supposing I forced him to eat more or something,

147
00:15:47,682 --> 00:15:50,395
then he would, in laugh he would accept.

148
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:52,528
Very kindly person.

149
00:15:52,729 --> 00:15:55,295
But with others was very strict, and I used to tell him that,

150
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,043
“Why are you strict with everyone?”

151
00:15:58,446 --> 00:16:01,239
He said, “But You are a little girl, You get up in the morning time.

152
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,089
Why can’t they get up?” I said, “I am little. That’s why I get up.

153
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:08,695
They are big so they can’t get up”; like that, you see, little chats.

154
00:16:09,096 --> 00:16:11,156
And then My father went to jail

155
00:16:11,357 --> 00:16:13,083
and My mother also went to jail five times.

156
00:16:13,284 --> 00:16:15,495
My father went to jail twice,

157
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:17,504
once for about two and a half years,

158
00:16:17,705 --> 00:16:20,694
and he was the only supporting member of the family.

159
00:16:20,965 --> 00:16:24,769
By the way, we come from a very old royal family,

160
00:16:24,986 --> 00:16:30,261
which is called as Shalivahanas. They have a Calendar also in India.

161
00:16:30,462 --> 00:16:36,895
And then when we, I mean when they took My father to jail,

162
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,633
we had to leave our house and we had to live in huts

163
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:42,586
and in all problems, that was nothing.

164
00:16:42,787 --> 00:16:43,947
But also Me

165
00:16:44,146 --> 00:16:46,891
they pestered a lot, because I helped many people there

166
00:16:47,092 --> 00:16:50,050
and I joined the ’42 movement in a very serious way

167
00:16:50,251 --> 00:16:52,438
and I became the leader here for the young people.

168
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,236
I thought unless and until I take a very positive stand,

169
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:59,069
it may not work out with them.

170
00:17:00,796 --> 00:17:04,801
It’s not gracious to say how they tortured Me, what they did to Me,

171
00:17:05,002 --> 00:17:06,259
but they really tortured Me.

172
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,639
I was a young girl of nineteen years that time.

173
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:14,470
It is over now. So, it’s finished, and after that we,

174
00:17:14,671 --> 00:17:17,161
My father went to jail again

175
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:19,253
and then when he came back

176
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:24,277
he got elected as the member of the Central Assembly later on,

177
00:17:24,478 --> 00:17:28,226
as the Constituent Assembly and then at the Parliament.

178
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:32,083
My brother was also a member of the Parliament, later on.

179
00:17:32,284 --> 00:17:37,218
Now, recently, he was the Minister in the Cabinet.

180
00:17:37,419 --> 00:17:42,035
Another brother is a High Court judge in Bombay.

181
00:17:42,236 --> 00:17:44,276
They are all doing well, despite the fact

182
00:17:44,477 --> 00:17:47,533
that our parents neglected us in a way

183
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,730
because they gave their lives for the country

184
00:17:49,931 --> 00:17:52,866
but, you see, that never deterred us from studies

185
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:55,246
and we came up very well.

186
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:57,968
Then I, when I was in the ’42 movement, you see,

187
00:17:58,169 --> 00:18:00,063
My college rusticated Me

188
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:02,547
– from the college they threw Me out

189
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,712
and I had to go to another college to study

190
00:18:05,863 --> 00:18:09,730
far away from My house, in Punjab,

191
00:18:09,931 --> 00:18:12,882
where I studied for two years.

192
00:18:12,994 --> 00:18:16,993
Science I did, then I did my medical.

193
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:22,726
I didn’t do fully because, just after that the ’47 riots broke out,

194
00:18:22,927 --> 00:18:25,178
so our college was closed and I didn’t want to know more

195
00:18:25,379 --> 00:18:28,072
because what I wanted to know I came to know about it.

196
00:18:28,335 --> 00:18:31,701
So I did not need and I got married.

197
00:18:32,696 --> 00:18:34,847
You must have heard My husband was, is now

198
00:18:35,048 --> 00:18:38,645
the Secretary-General of the International Maritime Organization.

199
00:18:38,846 --> 00:18:40,671
He held very high positions.

200
00:18:40,872 --> 00:18:44,721
He was also Secretary to Lal Bahadur Shastri,

201
00:18:44,922 --> 00:18:47,943
who was our Prime Minister, who was a another very great man,

202
00:18:48,183 --> 00:18:51,241
but he did not survive long. If he had survived

203
00:18:51,442 --> 00:18:53,901
things would have been different, I think, for our country

204
00:18:54,102 --> 00:18:57,043
because he was a Gandhian, out and out Gandhian,

205
00:18:57,244 --> 00:19:01,378
and he lived like an ideal Gandhian personality.

206
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:06,243
So that’s how the life went on.

207
00:19:06,444 --> 00:19:11,890
But inner being was still seeking the way and methods

208
00:19:12,091 --> 00:19:14,553
of giving en masse Realization.

209
00:19:15,373 --> 00:19:20,585
My father said, “Before You do not develop this technique

210
00:19:20,786 --> 00:19:23,678
of giving en masse Realization, don’t talk of religion.

211
00:19:23,879 --> 00:19:26,376
Let nobody know that You know anything about it

212
00:19:26,577 --> 00:19:29,343
because they’ll crucify You,” or

213
00:19:29,544 --> 00:19:31,986
he was rather worried that people won’t understand

214
00:19:32,187 --> 00:19:34,267
or, ‘You may write another Bible or Geeta. No use.

215
00:19:34,468 --> 00:19:37,889
First of all you must give them Realization.

216
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,752
If they get their Realization

217
00:19:39,953 --> 00:19:42,190
then they will realize that there is something about,

218
00:19:42,391 --> 00:19:45,354
above this human awareness”.

219
00:19:45,555 --> 00:19:48,192
For example, he always used to give an analogy -

220
00:19:48,393 --> 00:19:51,095
supposing you are born on the tenth storey

221
00:19:51,296 --> 00:19:52,881
and everybody is on the ground,

222
00:19:53,082 --> 00:19:55,560
you must at least make them climb two storeys,

223
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,679
so they know there is something above it;

224
00:19:57,880 --> 00:19:59,846
otherwise no use talking about it.

225
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:02,747
And he said this is the mistake

226
00:20:02,948 --> 00:20:05,725
between the saints and the incarnations was

227
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:09,240
that they never realized that these people are still on the ground,

228
00:20:09,441 --> 00:20:13,387
they have to still enter into the building.

229
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,719
So that is what you have to be very careful

230
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:19,107
that first of all you must give Realization to people.

231
00:20:19,889 --> 00:20:22,986
So I was seeking the ways and methods,

232
00:20:23,187 --> 00:20:25,209
working it out inside Myself

233
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:29,113
through My own style of meditation in the sense that

234
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:31,729
I would work out all the permutations and combinations.

235
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:34,957
Supposing I met one person, then I would see

236
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:39,110
what problems that person had, how you can overcome it like that.

237
00:20:39,311 --> 00:20:42,825
I would try to study that person internally.

238
00:20:44,016 --> 00:20:46,517
And I went to many people to find out,

239
00:20:46,718 --> 00:20:49,085
but I found they were great hypocrites.

240
00:20:49,286 --> 00:20:50,892
I saw so many of these gurus.

241
00:20:51,093 --> 00:20:54,995
Most of them I saw them, I was surprised, they were all hypocrites,

242
00:20:55,196 --> 00:20:57,332
money-making and this thing.

243
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:01,293
And also I went to Rajneesh also, to see him.

244
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:05,230
Then he said that I should come to his program.

245
00:21:05,452 --> 00:21:06,753
I did not know what sort of man

246
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:09,173
because he was talking about Geeta and big, big things.

247
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:11,769
I thought he might be knowing something about it.

248
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:13,534
I went there, but my husband said,

249
00:21:13,735 --> 00:21:15,399
“No, I won't allow You to go to his camp”

250
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,043
So he arranged his own bungalow and all that for Me.

251
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,680
So I went down there

252
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,553
and there I couldn't see all the things that were going on

253
00:21:22,754 --> 00:21:24,832
and that is the day somehow or other

254
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,146
I said I must open the last chakra. So the last chakra was opened.

255
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:34,826
And I saw the Kundalini which is the Primordial force within us,

256
00:21:35,027 --> 00:21:38,732
which is the Holy Ghost within us,

257
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:41,772
rising like a telescope, opening out,

258
00:21:42,432 --> 00:21:46,462
and then I saw the whole thing open

259
00:21:46,663 --> 00:21:50,682
and a big torrential rain of breeze

260
00:21:50,897 --> 00:21:53,951
started flowing through My head all over,

261
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:56,990
as if, and I felt "I am lost now. I am no more there.

262
00:21:57,191 --> 00:22:00,022
It’s only the Grace is there, that is there."

263
00:22:00,223 --> 00:22:03,236
I saw it completely happening to Me.

264
00:22:03,437 --> 00:22:09,391
And, but I was amazed that when I went to Rajneesh, you see,

265
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,325
because before going I had to say goodbye.

266
00:22:11,526 --> 00:22:13,817
He never realized what had happened or anything.

267
00:22:14,018 --> 00:22:15,116
So I was surprised.

268
00:22:15,317 --> 00:22:18,558
I said, “This man doesn’t know anything about God”,

269
00:22:18,759 --> 00:22:20,959
and then I discovered that they were all hypocrites

270
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,765
and telling lies.

271
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:28,680
So in 1973 this happened, on 5th of May

272
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,564
’70, 1970, 5-th of May.

273
00:22:31,765 --> 00:22:33,644
And just after that

274
00:22:33,845 --> 00:22:37,704
we had a very big lecture in Jahangir Hall - there's a very big hall -

275
00:22:37,905 --> 00:22:40,859
and thousands of people had come. I told them very frankly

276
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,687
that these are all thugs and these are like this, hypocrites.

277
00:22:43,888 --> 00:22:46,173
Some of them are demoniacs. Some are evil people.

278
00:22:46,374 --> 00:22:49,882
I took their names, everything. I told them, “Don’t go near them.”

279
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,607
There were some foreigners also.

280
00:23:25,343 --> 00:23:29,993
And there were so many others whom I told these things very clearly,

281
00:23:30,213 --> 00:23:32,809
and they got frightened. They said, “You shouldn’t say like this.

282
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:34,508
They’ll come and murder you. They’ll do..."

283
00:23:34,709 --> 00:23:36,231
”I said, “Let them come and murder Me.”

284
00:23:36,432 --> 00:23:40,188
But nobody did anything. Nobody even went to the courts.

285
00:23:40,389 --> 00:23:45,476
And that’s how, you see, they tried to bring bad name to Me.

286
00:23:45,677 --> 00:23:49,158
They paid money to the newspapers to publish things against Me,

287
00:23:49,359 --> 00:23:51,675
because I said, “You cannot pay money.”

288
00:23:51,876 --> 00:23:56,578
So they thought that I was just trying to, you see, harm them

289
00:23:56,779 --> 00:24:00,185
by saying such a thing that you can’t earn money in the name of God.

290
00:24:00,386 --> 00:24:04,611
If it’s a job you can do it, but God’s work is not a job.

291
00:24:04,812 --> 00:24:09,209
And the struggle started

292
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:12,502
from the day I started giving Realization,

293
00:24:12,703 --> 00:24:16,866
and I started with one lady who got Realization first.

294
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:20,923
Then we got about twelve people who got Realization.

295
00:24:21,124 --> 00:24:27,048
In two years I got only about fourteen people Realization.

296
00:24:27,377 --> 00:24:30,208
Then gradually when fourteen people got Realization then

297
00:24:30,409 --> 00:24:33,134
many others started getting Realization.

298
00:24:33,335 --> 00:24:38,465
But I started also curing people because that was helping a lot.

299
00:24:38,666 --> 00:24:43,162
Then My husband got elected to this post

300
00:24:43,363 --> 00:24:45,445
and we had to come to London.

301
00:24:45,646 --> 00:24:47,022
So when I came to London

302
00:24:47,223 --> 00:24:50,870
we had one program in Bhartiya Vidya Bhavan. They arranged it.

303
00:24:51,121 --> 00:24:54,242
So the Indians abroad are not so much interested in God;

304
00:24:54,443 --> 00:24:56,340
they are more interested in money.

305
00:24:56,541 --> 00:24:59,949
So none of the Indians stayed there. They all ran away.

306
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:05,848
And only the foreigners who were there, were about seven hippies.

307
00:25:06,049 --> 00:25:07,978
So I had to work on them, seven hippies.

308
00:25:08,179 --> 00:25:11,982
For four years I was working on them, to give them Realization.

309
00:25:12,183 --> 00:25:14,694
Very difficult, you see. Their liver was bad.

310
00:25:14,895 --> 00:25:18,486
They had ill health. Their head was off, terrible times.

311
00:25:18,687 --> 00:25:20,778
But in between I used to go to India,

312
00:25:20,979 --> 00:25:22,810
and in India also the work was done.

313
00:25:23,011 --> 00:25:25,109
For three months always I would be in India.

314
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:27,469
So we started working in the villages,

315
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:30,709
specially surprisingly where My forefathers were ruling,

316
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:34,218
in that area, the work started moving in a very big way.

317
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:38,151
And there then we started taking some people from India.

318
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:43,138
Then some people came from Australia to India, like that,

319
00:25:43,384 --> 00:25:47,523
and the work started moving in those directions.

320
00:25:47,724 --> 00:25:50,943
Then gradually the work improved and people found

321
00:25:51,144 --> 00:25:54,190
that this is the way we can transform ourselves.

322
00:25:54,391 --> 00:25:57,512
Many people who were taking drugs or alcoholic

323
00:25:57,713 --> 00:26:00,313
or mad people, or cancer people ,

324
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:02,908
they felt better, then they got cured

325
00:26:03,109 --> 00:26:08,281
and it was established that Sahaja Yoga is something very important.

326
00:26:09,868 --> 00:26:12,862
Now when I travel all over the world,

327
00:26:13,063 --> 00:26:16,099
you see, first My husband used to pay for everything.

328
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,705
Wherever I went, he had to pay all.

329
00:26:18,906 --> 00:26:21,086
Any expenses he used to do for Me.

330
00:26:21,287 --> 00:26:24,520
Gradually, then now, these people pay for My travel,

331
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:28,653
but otherwise they don’t have to pay for anything else

332
00:26:28,879 --> 00:26:33,024
That’s how we started our work. There was lot of opposition

333
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:37,626
and the media people would never understand it,

334
00:26:37,827 --> 00:26:41,842
because it was no such a sensation as you can say,

335
00:26:42,043 --> 00:26:43,771
nothing to people feel excited.

336
00:26:43,972 --> 00:26:45,491
But in a way it’s a very great thing,

337
00:26:45,692 --> 00:26:48,617
because if this is the solution for the whole world.

338
00:26:48,818 --> 00:26:50,580
One should try to do it.

339
00:26:50,781 --> 00:26:55,573
Then we had very great people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

340
00:26:55,774 --> 00:26:59,935
like, we can say,

341
00:27:00,136 --> 00:27:05,091
the Hague High Court judge, who is now the President,

342
00:27:05,366 --> 00:27:09,822
who has given Nicaragua, this thing judgment.

343
00:27:10,065 --> 00:27:14,151
He and many lawyers and many barristers.

344
00:27:14,352 --> 00:27:17,675
We have one barrister here from Algeria,

345
00:27:17,876 --> 00:27:20,229
and doctors, and then they took over

346
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:24,942
and they started helping Me out how to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

347
00:27:26,550 --> 00:27:28,845
But it was a difficult task in the West.

348
00:27:29,046 --> 00:27:31,548
Of course, in India it spread very fast in the villages

349
00:27:31,749 --> 00:27:33,737
but city people in India also

350
00:27:33,968 --> 00:27:36,513
are westernized and they start analyzing.

351
00:27:36,714 --> 00:27:38,699
They don’t know much about our past.

352
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:41,155
They don’t know anything about our heritage,

353
00:27:41,235 --> 00:27:43,756
that we have our Kundalini and all that.

354
00:27:43,957 --> 00:27:46,499
But some people do know about self-Realization.

355
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,710
But these gurus could not stick on in India

356
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:52,366
because nobody would accept them. So they all run away abroad.

357
00:27:52,606 --> 00:27:54,694
And that was something a blessing for Me also

358
00:27:54,895 --> 00:27:57,527
because I didn’t have to fight them there,

359
00:27:57,728 --> 00:28:00,240
and it started working out,

360
00:28:00,441 --> 00:28:03,023
and then people found that it helps in every way,

361
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,941
and they found so many miracles about it,

362
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:09,813
and that’s how Sahaja Yoga got settled quite a lot.

363
00:28:10,014 --> 00:28:12,035
But still I would say that

364
00:28:12,236 --> 00:28:14,751
we have not been to certain countries so far,

365
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:19,697
and in the west, I would say that so much work has still to be done.

366
00:28:19,898 --> 00:28:23,011
Because as soon as you start any work in any place,

367
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:26,368
first of all they want Me to cure people

368
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:28,870
and to help them with curatives.

369
00:28:29,071 --> 00:28:31,650
Now if I pay attention more to that,

370
00:28:31,851 --> 00:28:35,668
then the main work is to create doctors out of everyone.

371
00:28:35,869 --> 00:28:38,375
That is neglected. Then you become unpopular.

372
00:28:38,576 --> 00:28:41,422
They think, “Oh, She is not sympathetic” and this and that.

373
00:28:41,623 --> 00:28:43,607
But now as we have, everybody can cure now,

374
00:28:43,808 --> 00:28:46,113
everyone. I don’t cure anyone directly.

375
00:28:46,314 --> 00:28:48,719
But they don’t like it. They want I should be there

376
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:51,383
and their ego to be pampered and all those things are there.

377
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,909
Rather difficult.

378
00:28:53,110 --> 00:28:55,673
It’s not, we are not running an election, you see,

379
00:28:55,874 --> 00:28:58,392
like we should please others sort of thing, is not there.

380
00:28:58,593 --> 00:29:00,691
But whatever is reality,

381
00:29:00,892 --> 00:29:05,608
if a person has intelligence – pure intelligence

382
00:29:05,809 --> 00:29:08,727
– he can see that this is something very different

383
00:29:08,928 --> 00:29:11,486
and for that one has to

384
00:29:11,687 --> 00:29:15,628
understand that you cannot,

385
00:29:15,829 --> 00:29:20,784
you cannot force on anyone that "You get your Realization".

386
00:29:20,985 --> 00:29:25,062
In the same way you cannot force Me that I give you Realization,

387
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,152
because if it does not work, it does not work.

388
00:29:27,353 --> 00:29:28,870
It’s such a living force, you see.

389
00:29:29,071 --> 00:29:31,952
And that upsets them very soon.

390
00:29:32,153 --> 00:29:35,726
I feel that the way

391
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:40,267
this industrial revolution has come in the west,

392
00:29:40,468 --> 00:29:43,966
people have lost their moorings, perhaps. They are so confused.

393
00:29:44,167 --> 00:29:47,066
With all these gurus coming down here confusing them

394
00:29:47,267 --> 00:29:51,760
and all kinds of new things coming, they don’t know where to look.

395
00:29:51,961 --> 00:29:55,893
But unless and until you get your evolution completed,

396
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:59,670
unless and until you reach that absolute state of understanding,

397
00:29:59,871 --> 00:30:01,361
the chaos will remain.

398
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:04,289
So one has to try to get to that.

399
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,439
But one must understand you can’t pay for it. There is no effort.

400
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,798
After getting Realization

401
00:30:10,999 --> 00:30:13,345
they feel so satisfied, they forget about it.

402
00:30:13,546 --> 00:30:16,211
But after that you must know how to give it to others.

403
00:30:16,412 --> 00:30:19,862
As Christ has said that the light which is enlightened,

404
00:30:20,063 --> 00:30:21,960
you do not put it under the table.

405
00:30:22,161 --> 00:30:23,957
That’s how what happens that,

406
00:30:24,158 --> 00:30:27,321
it's a, though we may give Realization at hundred people,

407
00:30:27,522 --> 00:30:31,355
only out of that five to six will come forward to help us out.

408
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:34,062
But still I must say lot of work has been done.

409
00:30:34,263 --> 00:30:36,927
Especially Austria, I am very proud of Austria.

410
00:30:37,128 --> 00:30:42,178
And the way they have never given Me any problem – never –

411
00:30:42,383 --> 00:30:45,157
and very good people have come out of Austria.

412
00:30:45,357 --> 00:30:51,552
Very balanced, you see, level-headed people, very level-headed.

413
00:30:51,753 --> 00:30:54,410
They are not extremists. They do not go to extremes.

414
00:30:54,611 --> 00:30:58,648
There is no fanaticism about them. They are sensible people,

415
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:03,263
and something so lucky that Austria was found out

416
00:31:03,464 --> 00:31:06,703
because I never expected that in Austria

417
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:09,203
there will be so many people. But somehow

418
00:31:09,404 --> 00:31:13,655
like water finds its own level, Sahaja Yoga finds its own level.

419
00:31:13,856 --> 00:31:15,740
We just came down to Austria.

420
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:20,441
We haven’t been to Norway, to Sweden, Denmark, Finland.

421
00:31:20,642 --> 00:31:23,697
I visited those places because of My husband’s job

422
00:31:23,898 --> 00:31:26,070
but I have not been there.

423
00:31:26,271 --> 00:31:32,563
Now we have sixteen centers in Australia,

424
00:31:32,764 --> 00:31:35,804
and Australia is a very progressive Sahaja Yoga thing.

425
00:31:36,005 --> 00:31:38,876
We have got schools now there. They are running schools

426
00:31:39,077 --> 00:31:45,792
and the teachers are extremely well-behaved and visionaries,

427
00:31:45,993 --> 00:31:48,345
and they look after the children very well.

428
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:53,293
The Government people sent somebody for observation

429
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,449
and they have remarked that whatever they proclaim,

430
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,198
that’s what they manifest,

431
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:01,276
and they have given good certificates to us.

432
00:32:01,477 --> 00:32:05,083
But the greatest achievement on the outward life is this,

433
00:32:05,284 --> 00:32:08,576
that Cambridge University has accepted Sahaja Yoga

434
00:32:08,777 --> 00:32:12,540
for a research work, with respect, by one Dr. Lee,

435
00:32:12,741 --> 00:32:15,500
who is doing the research about Sahaja Yoga in Cambridge University.

436
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:16,840
He is already a Doctor.

437
00:32:17,041 --> 00:32:20,991
And there is another great thing has happened in Delhi University,

438
00:32:21,192 --> 00:32:24,200
that the Delhi University has accepted

439
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:30,202
that a person can do, only a doctor can do, a PhD,

440
00:32:30,403 --> 00:32:33,172
or we can say the Doctorate in Sahaja Yoga,

441
00:32:33,390 --> 00:32:39,461
and he gets the highest degree called the Doctor of Medicine,

442
00:32:39,662 --> 00:32:44,303
and perhaps maybe after sometime they will allow anyone to do that.

443
00:32:44,504 --> 00:32:46,295
This is about the medicine part of it.

444
00:32:46,496 --> 00:32:49,168
In agriculture we have done lots of research, Myself.

445
00:32:49,369 --> 00:32:52,443
We have somebody here, an expert on agriculture.

446
00:32:52,644 --> 00:32:54,808
He has also done lot of research,

447
00:32:55,009 --> 00:33:00,378
and we found out, that with vibrations we start after Realization,

448
00:33:00,579 --> 00:33:05,176
if you vibrate the water and if you water the plants with that,

449
00:33:05,377 --> 00:33:08,368
then sometimes you might get even ten times more breed.

450
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:12,849
That’s what they did in India, in one of the Agricultural University.

451
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,068
But here also he’s found out that there’s tremendous difference

452
00:33:16,269 --> 00:33:18,796
between the growth of an ordinary thing.

453
00:33:19,045 --> 00:33:21,586
Another thing we have found out in agriculture,

454
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:23,708
that if you give vibrations then

455
00:33:23,909 --> 00:33:27,769
even an ordinary cow can give lot of milk.

456
00:33:28,401 --> 00:33:30,814
But if you have hybrid cows then, you see,

457
00:33:31,015 --> 00:33:32,369
it’s not good for the brain,

458
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:36,472
because a person who takes hybrid milk, also gets hybrid.

459
00:33:36,673 --> 00:33:38,845
I mean his brain becomes little wobbly.

460
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:42,019
So better to have a pure milk from a cow

461
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:46,870
which is not been put to this kind of a experimentation.

462
00:33:47,071 --> 00:33:49,406
Moreover, food also, if it’s hybrid food,

463
00:33:49,607 --> 00:33:53,260
it’s not very good for us because that spoils our nerves, I think.

464
00:33:53,461 --> 00:33:57,456
But ordinary seeds you cannot use because they have weakened

465
00:33:57,657 --> 00:33:59,218
and they cannot reproduce.

466
00:33:59,419 --> 00:34:01,957
So when we vibrate them

467
00:34:02,158 --> 00:34:04,706
they produce very well just like,

468
00:34:04,907 --> 00:34:07,268
better than even sometimes, hybrid thing,

469
00:34:07,469 --> 00:34:09,522
and the food, it tastes very well

470
00:34:09,723 --> 00:34:11,671
and it doesn’t give those complications.

471
00:34:11,872 --> 00:34:14,149
So this can help in agriculture in India,

472
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:17,329
and the government has allotted us lot of land

473
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:19,696
where we are going to now experiment,

474
00:34:19,897 --> 00:34:22,251
and we are going to start the experimentation there

475
00:34:22,452 --> 00:34:24,809
to show that how we can use this.

476
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:28,499
But many farmers who are Sahaja Yogis have done a lot of job

477
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:32,760
and they have discovered that even animals

478
00:34:32,961 --> 00:34:35,419
and this, what you call,

479
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:39,961
farming, everything is helped very much by vibration.

480
00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,579
So it improves the lives of people.

481
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,373
We have on the other side, social side, I can tell you that

482
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:50,558
we have our marriages – international marriages.

483
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:54,975
We arrange international marriages between people.

484
00:34:55,176 --> 00:35:00,894
They have to know each other and they are together.

485
00:35:01,095 --> 00:35:05,345
And first of all they are together for one or half month

486
00:35:05,546 --> 00:35:07,210
with us in the tour. They see each other

487
00:35:07,411 --> 00:35:08,826
and their marriages are fixed.

488
00:35:09,027 --> 00:35:12,912
And we have seen that such marriages are extremely successful.

489
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:15,602
Ninety-nine percent marriages are successful.

490
00:35:15,803 --> 00:35:17,500
Once in a while, maybe a mishap,

491
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:20,307
but mostly there are no divorces that take place.

492
00:35:20,508 --> 00:35:22,373
Once in a while if it’s not successful

493
00:35:22,574 --> 00:35:24,231
we have no objection to divorce also,

494
00:35:24,484 --> 00:35:26,810
but mostly it is successful and they get children

495
00:35:27,011 --> 00:35:29,011
who are very intelligent,

496
00:35:29,202 --> 00:35:31,877
who are themselves born realized children, mostly.

497
00:35:32,078 --> 00:35:35,737
So the problem is much less and the family life improves.

498
00:35:35,938 --> 00:35:38,829
The quality of life is thousand times better.

499
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:42,104
People are very joyous, happy, they do not complain,

500
00:35:42,305 --> 00:35:44,402
and they enjoy life and they give to others.

501
00:35:44,603 --> 00:35:47,836
They share what joy they have. So …

502
00:35:48,037 --> 00:35:49,065
I: Can I ask a question?

503
00:35:49,266 --> 00:35:51,001
What do you think are the important points

504
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:52,835
in the education of children,

505
00:35:53,036 --> 00:35:56,704
what are important to give to the children?

506
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:59,609
You see, first if they get Realization,

507
00:35:59,810 --> 00:36:02,511
to get first time to that point of Realization...

508
00:36:02,712 --> 00:36:04,742
If they are already born realized no problem,

509
00:36:04,943 --> 00:36:07,326
but if they have, they're given Realization,

510
00:36:07,527 --> 00:36:10,242
then, you see, they start seeing from a different level.

511
00:36:10,443 --> 00:36:14,222
They become the Spirit. So their self-respect, you see, awaken.

512
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:20,187
Such children behave in a very dignified, elderly manner, you see.

513
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,811
They talk in a very elderly manner

514
00:36:23,012 --> 00:36:25,595
and this gives solutions of all kinds, you see.

515
00:36:25,796 --> 00:36:28,650
And they are tremendous people.

516
00:36:28,851 --> 00:36:32,527
But we have to guide them properly by our own behavior,

517
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:35,866
how we behave. The greatest thing is how we behave.

518
00:36:36,067 --> 00:36:37,774
That’s how the children learn.

519
00:36:37,975 --> 00:36:41,889
We put the children certain

520
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:44,439
to some tests, how they are.

521
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,918
We find out if they have any physical problems, we cure them.

522
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,310
If they have mental problem, we cure them.

523
00:36:50,511 --> 00:36:54,222
If they have any other problem, social problem or anything,

524
00:36:54,423 --> 00:36:55,739
we try to help them out.

525
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:00,379
So that basically if a human being is all right in the childhood,

526
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,990
then fundamentals are all right for the child.

527
00:37:03,191 --> 00:37:04,563
The foundation is laid down.

528
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,953
Then to build a child up into a good quality is not difficult.

529
00:37:09,154 --> 00:37:12,725
So now we find great artists are there,

530
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:14,947
there are great musicians

531
00:37:15,148 --> 00:37:18,183
and at a very young age they have started playing violin...

532
00:37:18,384 --> 00:37:21,844
I mean suddenly they have become dynamic also and very humble.

533
00:37:22,045 --> 00:37:25,353
They are very humble and self-respectfing and very well-behaved.

534
00:37:25,554 --> 00:37:29,790
It's surprising how the atmosphere is and how it works out.

535
00:37:29,991 --> 00:37:32,873
And the other day the lady asked Me about the women

536
00:37:33,074 --> 00:37:37,199
and I told her that a woman’s power as a mother is very great.

537
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,267
And she felt hurt about it. But I didn’t mean

538
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:41,397
that you should be just a mother. What I am saying,

539
00:37:41,598 --> 00:37:44,992
she is a mother, means she is compassionate, she is kind,

540
00:37:45,193 --> 00:37:46,938
she is not aggressive like men.

541
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,710
That is a very big quality.

542
00:37:48,911 --> 00:37:51,831
That is a very big power in a woman. That is what I was suggesting

543
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:53,659
that that is what we have to earn,

544
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,840
is not to compete with men. It's madness to compete with men,

545
00:37:58,041 --> 00:38:01,260
and to go about like that, because...

546
00:38:13,225 --> 00:38:16,939
You see we have to understand that life

547
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:22,141
has to be enjoyable.

548
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:25,887
Life is to be a blessing, not to be a misery.

549
00:38:26,106 --> 00:38:29,364
We create our own miseries by these false ideas,

550
00:38:29,565 --> 00:38:34,832
by our own conflictions we have in our mind,

551
00:38:35,033 --> 00:38:37,146
mental projections we have in our mind,

552
00:38:37,337 --> 00:38:40,126
or our own obstinacy – whatever it is.

553
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:42,606
All these things can be cured

554
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:44,281
if you take to Sahaja Yoga

555
00:38:44,482 --> 00:38:47,832
because you become a balanced person, level-headed, wise person.

556
00:38:48,033 --> 00:38:49,078
And you become a witness.

557
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:51,699
The whole thing becomes like a show, like a drama.

558
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:52,940
And you become fearless,

559
00:38:53,141 --> 00:38:55,080
you start seeing the whole thing like a drama.

560
00:38:55,281 --> 00:38:57,572
And this is what a human being has to achieve.

561
00:38:57,773 --> 00:39:01,167
We talk of peace. We talk of no war.

562
00:39:01,368 --> 00:39:03,351
We talk of many things like this, you see,

563
00:39:03,552 --> 00:39:06,837
atomic bomb, this, that... All that is not going to work out.

564
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:08,328
Only what is going to work out

565
00:39:08,529 --> 00:39:10,428
is the transformation of human beings.

566
00:39:10,629 --> 00:39:12,385
If the human beings are transformed,

567
00:39:12,586 --> 00:39:15,001
things will work out absolutely first class.

568
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:20,983
Not only that, but that they will enjoy the bliss of life.

569
00:39:21,184 --> 00:39:23,833
We are missing the point altogether!

570
00:39:24,034 --> 00:39:26,814
This is a very important thing

571
00:39:27,015 --> 00:39:28,933
that human beings must say, one thing:

572
00:39:29,134 --> 00:39:31,663
what have we achieved out of all these?

573
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:34,215
Just for a minute to stop and think.

574
00:39:36,481 --> 00:39:38,790
What would you say is the definition of illness?

575
00:39:38,926 --> 00:39:41,376
What's the causes of illness?

576
00:39:42,223 --> 00:39:46,110
It’s the physical, mental, emotional, all illnesses are caused

577
00:39:46,311 --> 00:39:50,118
by the imbalances within us, by our extreme behavior.

578
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:54,117
And supposing say now the cancer. We can take the cancer.

579
00:39:54,318 --> 00:39:57,548
Cancer is caused by the over-activity

580
00:39:57,749 --> 00:40:00,071
of the sympathetic nervous system.

581
00:40:00,272 --> 00:40:05,839
Now supposing a person is a very sad person.

582
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:09,460
He cries and weeps and all the time feels guilty

583
00:40:09,661 --> 00:40:12,276
and thinks that he is the worst person ever born,

584
00:40:12,477 --> 00:40:15,901
he’s committed so many sins and all sorts of nonsense, you see.

585
00:40:16,141 --> 00:40:18,585
Then he goes to the left side, according to us

586
00:40:18,786 --> 00:40:21,533
and crosses over to the collective subconscious area.

587
00:40:21,734 --> 00:40:25,326
And there, according to us, what they call as Protein 58,

588
00:40:25,527 --> 00:40:28,248
and Protein 52, doctors call it that way,

589
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:30,521
but we call it as the dead souls;

590
00:40:30,722 --> 00:40:33,069
they exist there and they catch hold of you

591
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:35,450
and they trigger the cancer.

592
00:40:35,651 --> 00:40:37,084
But supposing by any chance

593
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:40,748
you can bring the attention fully away from that

594
00:40:40,949 --> 00:40:43,104
in the center you can get cured.

595
00:40:43,305 --> 00:40:47,035
So it is the centers within us which are subtle,

596
00:40:47,270 --> 00:40:49,561
which are basically seven centers.

597
00:40:49,762 --> 00:40:51,744
There are many others, but basically seven.

598
00:40:51,921 --> 00:40:53,297
If you can put them right,

599
00:40:53,498 --> 00:40:57,501
you cannot have any sickness or illness, of any kind.

600
00:40:59,002 --> 00:41:02,339
Let's go back to your childhood.

601
00:41:02,609 --> 00:41:07,259
Can You explain - Your parents

602
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:10,893
supported You very much in Your learning and in Your studies.

603
00:41:11,094 --> 00:41:13,314
It’s correct? [unclear]

604
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:16,811
Yes, yes. Of course. You see in...

605
00:41:17,012 --> 00:41:18,621
Is this normal

606
00:41:18,758 --> 00:41:21,583
that parents support the child like You in Your family?

607
00:41:21,784 --> 00:41:24,729
In India, all parents support the child.

608
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:27,364
- Even if...
- You can learn everything what You want to?

609
00:41:27,581 --> 00:41:29,216
Yes, yes, I mean, that is true.

610
00:41:29,454 --> 00:41:31,257
But you see the basic thing is

611
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:34,946
parents are very benevolent to children, very kind to children,

612
00:41:35,147 --> 00:41:40,095
and to them, you see, the child’s education, child’s upbringing

613
00:41:40,296 --> 00:41:43,209
and child’s life is very important.

614
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:47,291
That’s why we know they are, so we depend on them,

615
00:41:47,492 --> 00:41:50,778
they look after us and they are very wise people.

616
00:41:50,979 --> 00:41:52,922
They sacrifice everything for us.

617
00:41:53,123 --> 00:41:56,340
So, whatever they say we think it’s nice

618
00:41:56,556 --> 00:41:59,561
and by doing this we have not lost anything so far.

619
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:02,005
In India if you find Indian children when they come abroad

620
00:42:02,206 --> 00:42:04,106
they always talk the least anywhere.

621
00:42:04,307 --> 00:42:06,356
They are very obedient children

622
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,856
and they behave very well.

623
00:42:09,057 --> 00:42:11,900
We don’t have all this problem, teenage problem, homosexual.

624
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:13,975
We don’t know even all this problems are

625
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:16,585
because we are so close with the parents all the time.

626
00:42:16,786 --> 00:42:19,118
They all the time watch us. We don’t have drug problem,

627
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:22,099
none of these. Only in the cities, little bit,

628
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,841
it happens and it disappears;

629
00:42:24,042 --> 00:42:26,251
because parents are all the time with their children.

630
00:42:26,452 --> 00:42:28,808
We live together. The whole family lives together.

631
00:42:29,009 --> 00:42:30,664
And not only with the parents

632
00:42:30,865 --> 00:42:33,649
but all the relations and all the people

633
00:42:33,850 --> 00:42:36,765
in the village and the city, everyone knows each other.

634
00:42:36,966 --> 00:42:39,469
Such a joint system we have

635
00:42:39,636 --> 00:42:43,770
that we do not normally,

636
00:42:43,971 --> 00:42:46,986
sort of, go into wrong ways and methods

637
00:42:47,187 --> 00:42:49,702
and we do not become obstinate also.

638
00:42:50,377 --> 00:42:52,793
- But, You grew up in a Christian family in India.
- Yes.

639
00:42:52,994 --> 00:42:54,066
Yes.

640
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:58,564
It’s not a normal situation, that Indian people are Christian.

641
00:42:58,765 --> 00:43:00,369
Yes, I know. It is, you see,

642
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:02,911
I was born in a Christian family deliberately,

643
00:43:03,094 --> 00:43:06,958
because I think, you see, I personally think,

644
00:43:07,159 --> 00:43:09,997
that Protestants are the greatest fanatics;

645
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:12,180
because they are very sophisticated, you see,

646
00:43:12,381 --> 00:43:13,799
their fanaticism is in their brain.

647
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:15,926
Nobody can make them out of their fanaticism.

648
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,685
They are very great fanatics, the greatest of all.

649
00:43:18,886 --> 00:43:20,982
But My parents were very enlightened people

650
00:43:21,183 --> 00:43:23,215
and they understood Christ very well.

651
00:43:23,416 --> 00:43:26,021
Yesterday I told you about Paul, you see, when I was -

652
00:43:26,222 --> 00:43:28,161
first time I took the Bible in the hand

653
00:43:28,362 --> 00:43:30,097
and I asked My father, “Who is this Paul?”.

654
00:43:30,298 --> 00:43:33,514
He said “He is an intruder. Forget him. Don’t read him at all.”

655
00:43:33,715 --> 00:43:36,106
So you see they understood all these things very well

656
00:43:36,307 --> 00:43:38,409
and because My father was a realized soul,

657
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,821
like Khalil Gibran, you see. If you read Khalil Gibran,

658
00:43:41,022 --> 00:43:43,104
he says the same thing about Paul, the same thing.

659
00:43:43,305 --> 00:43:46,400
So, you see, if you are an enlightened person,

660
00:43:46,601 --> 00:43:48,382
you see the essence of everything.

661
00:43:48,583 --> 00:43:50,332
Whatever religion you may be born,

662
00:43:50,507 --> 00:43:53,387
you don’t ignore any other religion.

663
00:43:53,588 --> 00:43:55,600
You try to learn about other religion,

664
00:43:55,801 --> 00:43:58,332
and you find the essence is the same in every religion.

665
00:43:58,607 --> 00:43:59,743
What is there to fight?

666
00:43:59,944 --> 00:44:01,617
And that’s how you belong to no religion,

667
00:44:01,818 --> 00:44:04,659
you belong to every religion. That’s what happens.

668
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:07,828
But My parents were very enlightened people, I must say,

669
00:44:08,029 --> 00:44:11,775
and I was very lucky to choose them as My parents.

670
00:44:12,828 --> 00:44:15,322
You have been an enlightened child, is it correct?

671
00:44:15,523 --> 00:44:18,019
- I beg your pardon?
- You had been an enlightened child?

672
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:20,082
Yes, I have been born as an enlightened child.

673
00:44:20,283 --> 00:44:23,234
But You don’t feel sometimes very lonesome,

674
00:44:23,435 --> 00:44:28,035
because all the others are different?

675
00:44:28,444 --> 00:44:32,074
No, no, that is, you see, if you know how to share with others...

676
00:44:32,275 --> 00:44:36,090
Actually I was like a Mother to them from My very childhood.

677
00:44:36,291 --> 00:44:38,573
When My father, mother went to jail I was,

678
00:44:38,774 --> 00:44:41,658
first time, I was about, I think five and a half years of age.

679
00:44:41,859 --> 00:44:46,496
So I had all the keys of the house in My little frock thing,

680
00:44:46,697 --> 00:44:49,778
and I used to carry all the duties like a grandmother.

681
00:44:49,979 --> 00:44:51,809
I never felt lost. I mean,

682
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:54,558
My life is on the whole is very collective,

683
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:57,222
by temperament I am extremely collective.

684
00:44:57,423 --> 00:44:59,839
I can live anywhere. I can sleep anywhere.

685
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:01,929
I can live in the jungles. I can...

686
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,744
I have no problems of that. I am extremely collective.

687
00:45:05,945 --> 00:45:09,443
I am not exclusive by temperament, from very childhood.

688
00:45:09,644 --> 00:45:12,217
I was very friendly with all the people

689
00:45:12,418 --> 00:45:14,549
in that area where we were living

690
00:45:14,750 --> 00:45:17,016
and My mother was known as Nirmala’s mother,

691
00:45:17,217 --> 00:45:18,795
father was known as Nirmala’s father.

692
00:45:18,996 --> 00:45:21,707
So they said, “We have lost our identity because of Her”.

693
00:45:21,908 --> 00:45:25,440
So I was a very friendly person. I never felt lonely,

694
00:45:25,641 --> 00:45:28,207
and when I am with Myself I am never lonely at all.

695
00:45:28,408 --> 00:45:31,045
I enjoy Myself very much.

696
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:38,185
When You had been to the ashram with Gandhi,

697
00:45:38,386 --> 00:45:42,574
can You mention one or two impressions You remember

698
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:44,929
about Gandhi?

699
00:45:45,130 --> 00:45:46,755
Oh! Gandhiji was a tremendous man.

700
00:45:46,956 --> 00:45:49,018
One has to learn a lot from him.

701
00:45:49,219 --> 00:45:52,731
He was not at all a hypocrite, that’s one thing.

702
00:45:52,932 --> 00:45:57,215
And he was not like modern, we say, politicians,

703
00:45:57,416 --> 00:46:01,177
who says something, do something. No, he was very outspoken

704
00:46:01,378 --> 00:46:05,518
and always put himself on the testing point.

705
00:46:05,727 --> 00:46:09,711
And he used to confess if he made mistakes, immediately.

706
00:46:09,912 --> 00:46:14,196
One very great incident I remember, when I was a small child.

707
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:17,662
They were having a meeting together

708
00:46:17,863 --> 00:46:21,480
and we girls were there only sitting giving them

709
00:46:21,681 --> 00:46:23,534
water and things, to all the people.

710
00:46:23,735 --> 00:46:27,103
All the big people were there, like...

711
00:46:27,312 --> 00:46:30,495
Jawaharlal Lal Nehru was there and also Maulana Azad,

712
00:46:30,696 --> 00:46:32,557
all these people were sitting there.

713
00:46:32,758 --> 00:46:35,730
They were discussing something and then suddenly

714
00:46:35,931 --> 00:46:39,893
Mahatmaji said that, “Now it’s very late. We’ll have lunch here.”

715
00:46:40,563 --> 00:46:43,455
So they said, “Yes, yes, we’ll have lunch here.”

716
00:46:43,656 --> 00:46:46,313
They had to go to the guest house which was far away.

717
00:46:46,514 --> 00:46:51,810
So Mahatmaji asked for the Baa, is his wife. She had gone out.

718
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:54,092
So he got up. He had a key with him,

719
00:46:54,293 --> 00:46:56,011
you see, always of the store room.

720
00:46:56,178 --> 00:46:57,415
He opened the store room,

721
00:46:57,616 --> 00:47:01,116
and he asked the people who were in charge of cooking

722
00:47:01,317 --> 00:47:02,974
to measure everything

723
00:47:03,175 --> 00:47:07,004
according to the people there are, properly, everything, you see.

724
00:47:07,205 --> 00:47:10,714
And then he, and they measured it out, everything was done

725
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:12,154
then he put the key back,

726
00:47:12,355 --> 00:47:14,660
and then he went and sat there nicely.

727
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:16,564
So these people said,

728
00:47:16,765 --> 00:47:20,053
“Bapu, we did not know you had to take so much trouble,

729
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:24,363
you see, to go all the way and measure out everything out for us.”

730
00:47:24,564 --> 00:47:27,323
It did not take much time, about fifteen minutes, but still.

731
00:47:27,524 --> 00:47:29,677
So he said, “What do you think?

732
00:47:29,878 --> 00:47:34,202
This is the blood of my country. I cannot allow it to be wasted”.

733
00:47:34,403 --> 00:47:37,263
See, that’s the sign of a person who understands

734
00:47:37,464 --> 00:47:41,410
the value of public money. That’s just ingrained in him,

735
00:47:41,611 --> 00:47:45,156
but those who saw him also felt

736
00:47:45,388 --> 00:47:49,289
that, "Look at this man, who is living like an ascetic, absolutely,

737
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,525
in the sense that he would not touch the public money".

738
00:47:52,726 --> 00:47:56,239
And that is one of the key, keys for all the leaders.

739
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:00,078
If they are absolutely above the money,

740
00:48:00,279 --> 00:48:04,541
then only people will respect; otherwise, there is no way out.

741
00:48:04,742 --> 00:48:06,631
But you find these days in every country

742
00:48:06,832 --> 00:48:09,689
so much of corruption, hypocrisy,

743
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,900
then you are really shocked.

744
00:48:12,101 --> 00:48:14,152
What do You think is the reason

745
00:48:14,415 --> 00:48:18,660
of all these corruption, of the political instability?

746
00:48:19,317 --> 00:48:22,529
It’s ignorance. It is ignorance.

747
00:48:22,765 --> 00:48:27,776
They think by having money or by having big position

748
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:32,734
or by having a big name, they’ll be happy.

749
00:48:32,935 --> 00:48:36,232
They will not be happy. Only the ego will be pampered.

750
00:48:36,433 --> 00:48:39,650
When it is slightly hurt, the person will be unhappy.

751
00:48:39,851 --> 00:48:43,039
So he’ll be going into from happiness to unhappiness.

752
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:45,835
But when he gets the knowledge

753
00:48:46,034 --> 00:48:49,374
that it is the Spirit which is the source of joy,

754
00:48:49,575 --> 00:48:52,988
then he doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care for all these things.

755
00:48:53,189 --> 00:48:55,904
He is not afraid of anything. He lives like a Lord himself.

756
00:48:56,105 --> 00:48:58,223
He is a Lord, he doesn’t want anything.

757
00:48:58,422 --> 00:49:00,982
You see, the one who is the Lord doesn’t want anything.

758
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,163
For example, now, as you know, I come from a rich family,

759
00:49:04,364 --> 00:49:05,980
my husband from a rich family.

760
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:09,553
He’s now well to do. We have very comfortable living,

761
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:13,155
but I can live in a, on a street, I can sleep on a street,

762
00:49:13,356 --> 00:49:16,766
because I am like a queen. I don’t need anything.

763
00:49:16,967 --> 00:49:19,171
If you need anything then you are a beggar,

764
00:49:19,372 --> 00:49:21,393
otherwise you are a king, isn’t it?

765
00:49:21,594 --> 00:49:24,954
That’s what I feel. So that is what is the ignorance.

766
00:49:25,155 --> 00:49:29,515
Once they know we are just fighting our ignorance

767
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:31,380
they’ll give it up. It’s nonsense.

768
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:34,257
It is nonsense and it’s not at all joy giving.

769
00:49:34,458 --> 00:49:36,879
Your virtues are very joy giving.

770
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:42,252
If you know about your chastity, or you know about your honesty,

771
00:49:42,453 --> 00:49:45,267
or if you know about your straightforwardness,

772
00:49:45,468 --> 00:49:46,869
it’s very joy giving.

773
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:49,134
You feel so confident, so happy

774
00:49:49,335 --> 00:49:51,861
and such a person never tries to harm anyone,

775
00:49:52,062 --> 00:49:53,484
to be sarcastic with anyone.

776
00:49:53,685 --> 00:49:55,562
Such a person is absolutely free, I should say,

777
00:49:55,763 --> 00:49:58,092
because he has no bondages of any kind.

778
00:49:58,293 --> 00:50:00,512
These are all bondages which bind us

779
00:50:00,713 --> 00:50:03,583
and we become jealous and we become greedy,

780
00:50:03,784 --> 00:50:06,653
we become lusty. All this is nonsense.

781
00:50:07,388 --> 00:50:10,075
It’s to be just seen after getting to your Spirit

782
00:50:10,276 --> 00:50:12,844
that the light shows these are all like snakes, you see,

783
00:50:13,045 --> 00:50:15,855
crawling up on us and we are holding on to snakes.

784
00:50:16,056 --> 00:50:19,426
People when they die, you see - big, big people I have seen -

785
00:50:19,627 --> 00:50:21,429
people tell about them.

786
00:50:21,604 --> 00:50:24,080
In the history they go down as horrible people.

787
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:26,930
In the history they are described as people who were hypocrites,

788
00:50:27,131 --> 00:50:33,035
who were cruel, who were very, I should say, adamant type,

789
00:50:33,236 --> 00:50:34,896
and all kinds of things is described.

790
00:50:35,097 --> 00:50:38,325
Whatever is genuine remains genuine.

791
00:50:40,391 --> 00:50:43,542
You never, don’t feel frightened?

792
00:50:43,724 --> 00:50:48,464
No, I don’t. I don’t know anything like fear.

793
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:52,582
What’s there to be afraid of?

794
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:54,362
I am never afraid of,

795
00:50:54,563 --> 00:50:59,095
because if you believe and you know definitely there is God all over,

796
00:50:59,296 --> 00:51:01,050
there is nothing to be afraid of.

797
00:51:01,251 --> 00:51:04,438
He looks after you every moment, every minute.

798
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:06,400
Wherever you are, He looks after you.

799
00:51:06,601 --> 00:51:09,199
These people have had so many experiences of that.

800
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,893
There was one girl who was a Sahaja Yogini

801
00:51:13,094 --> 00:51:17,893
and she was driving somewhere in Germany on an Autobahn,

802
00:51:18,094 --> 00:51:19,819
and there were so many cars were with her.

803
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,071
And suddenly her brake failed

804
00:51:22,272 --> 00:51:24,132
and the car started going this way, that way.

805
00:51:24,333 --> 00:51:27,000
She didn’t know how to manage it. She said, “Now, what to do?”

806
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:29,728
She just... She had another one also with her.

807
00:51:29,929 --> 00:51:31,000
Both of them, they said,

808
00:51:31,201 --> 00:51:33,243
“All right, let us close our eyes and think of Mother.”

809
00:51:33,444 --> 00:51:35,663
They just started thinking of Me and said,

810
00:51:35,864 --> 00:51:38,293
“We’ll not be afraid, just think of Her”.

811
00:51:38,501 --> 00:51:41,055
And suddenly they found that their car had come

812
00:51:41,256 --> 00:51:46,359
to one side of the road very nicely without any scratch.

813
00:51:46,877 --> 00:51:52,375
So, you see, it is just our fear makes us more frantic and stupid.

814
00:51:52,576 --> 00:51:54,995
There is nothing to be afraid of.

815
00:51:55,196 --> 00:51:57,316
It is to be seen how God helps you.

816
00:51:57,517 --> 00:51:59,738
But people don’t want to take His help, you see.

817
00:51:59,939 --> 00:52:03,934
Then God says, “All right, go ahead and break your head. What to do?”

818
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,379
Sometimes other people are helping.

819
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:11,307
Yes, then you should know how to handle them.

820
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:14,108
You see, they, for example, yesterday that fellow came.

821
00:52:14,309 --> 00:52:16,218
You see, he just became like a beaten up dog.

822
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:19,592
You saw him coming and saying something to Me, which you never heard.

823
00:52:19,793 --> 00:52:22,896
But they belong to a cult, some sort of a cult, you see,

824
00:52:23,097 --> 00:52:26,825
and they always oppose us. They have some sort of Christians.

825
00:52:27,026 --> 00:52:31,816
And when I was in Geneva, one of the ladies,

826
00:52:32,017 --> 00:52:37,069
all, you see, dressed up in a very fashionable way,

827
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:40,469
she came to Me with a Bible in her hand to hit me, you see.

828
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:44,022
And everybody got frightened that now she is going to beat Me.

829
00:52:44,223 --> 00:52:47,499
This woman walked with big high heels upon Me

830
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:50,501
and I dont know, they thought she’ll do something to Me.

831
00:52:50,702 --> 00:52:52,681
As soon as I saw her with the Bible, you know,

832
00:52:52,888 --> 00:52:54,528
I started laughing, absolutely.

833
00:52:54,729 --> 00:52:57,175
I couldn’t bear. I thought, “Such a joker she is.

834
00:52:57,376 --> 00:52:59,875
She is coming to hit Me with a Bible? How can she do it?”

835
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:03,111
And she got worried about Me that I am laughing so much.

836
00:53:03,312 --> 00:53:04,524
It’s all on the tape.

837
00:53:04,725 --> 00:53:06,847
And these boys were very much frightened, I've seen.

838
00:53:07,048 --> 00:53:09,513
I was not at all. I said, “It’s perfectly all right,”

839
00:53:09,714 --> 00:53:11,917
and she ran away because she saw Me laughing, you know.

840
00:53:12,118 --> 00:53:15,398
I just couldn’t help [unclear] laughing at the joker,

841
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:19,007
the way she came to hit Me with a Bible. Imagine!

842
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:21,406
So this is what it is. If you are afraid

843
00:53:21,607 --> 00:53:24,976
then they sit on your heads. But you should not be afraid.

844
00:53:26,499 --> 00:53:31,081
There's a chinese story that there's one king who took two,

845
00:53:31,282 --> 00:53:37,557
two cocks for fighting to a very realised soul, a guru,

846
00:53:37,758 --> 00:53:40,486
and he said, "You make them all right".

847
00:53:40,687 --> 00:53:42,986
So he said "All right". He trained them for one month,

848
00:53:43,187 --> 00:53:44,720
and they went for a fight.

849
00:53:44,946 --> 00:53:48,799
So many cocks were brought him to fight these.

850
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,802
So these two were standing there,

851
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:53,428
they would no attack anyone, just standing.

852
00:53:53,629 --> 00:53:55,662
Everybody was attacking, they were just standing.

853
00:53:55,863 --> 00:53:57,462
Everybody got frightened, all the,

854
00:53:57,663 --> 00:54:00,175
all the cocks got frightened and ran away.

855
00:54:00,376 --> 00:54:03,529
And these two were standing there nicely.

856
00:54:05,069 --> 00:54:09,558
You should not attack anyone, nor anybody would attack you.

857
00:54:11,303 --> 00:54:13,038
Yes, they are there, but quite alright.

858
00:54:13,239 --> 00:54:14,900
But I am not frightened of them.

859
00:54:15,101 --> 00:54:18,930
So far nobody has been successful.

860
00:54:29,628 --> 00:54:35,368
P: I request Mataji, if Mataji can explain how to raise the Kundalini,

861
00:54:35,569 --> 00:54:38,415
that may help the guests also.

862
00:54:38,616 --> 00:54:42,575
Explain how to raise the Kundalini.
P: Yes

863
00:54:50,993 --> 00:54:55,331
He wants to know how the Kundalini is raised.

864
00:54:55,532 --> 00:54:59,187
As they explained the, yesterday in German language,

865
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:03,220
that at the base of our spine,

866
00:55:03,421 --> 00:55:06,765
there is a power lying there,

867
00:55:06,966 --> 00:55:10,329
which is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us.

868
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,059
And the Spirit lies in the heart

869
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,181
which is the reflection of God Almighty.

870
00:55:16,382 --> 00:55:21,681
So the power of God is the Holy Ghost, is a female power,

871
00:55:21,882 --> 00:55:26,818
because God is a male,

872
00:55:27,019 --> 00:55:31,622
then He has a son. There has to be a Mother to the son.

873
00:55:33,589 --> 00:55:35,965
They didn't want to have a woman there, imagine.

874
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:38,792
We cannot have women for...

875
00:55:38,993 --> 00:55:41,288
They cannot be ordained. This is too much.

876
00:55:41,489 --> 00:55:43,327
It's not in India like this, you see.

877
00:55:43,478 --> 00:55:45,433
You don't find this kind of a nonsense there

878
00:55:45,634 --> 00:55:48,483
but is here that women have accepted, though you are so advanced.

879
00:55:48,699 --> 00:55:51,454
There, here it is so stupid that women cannot become priests.

880
00:55:51,655 --> 00:55:54,468
Why can't they if the men can be?

881
00:55:54,669 --> 00:55:58,962
So, this, to avoid the women from the whole thing,

882
00:55:59,163 --> 00:56:04,316
they called It a Holy Ghost, without telling that it's a female.

883
00:56:04,517 --> 00:56:06,928
And that female power is the Shakti

884
00:56:07,129 --> 00:56:10,163
which resides in the triangular bone.

885
00:56:10,387 --> 00:56:17,958
Now, what happens, that when a person who is authorised,

886
00:56:18,159 --> 00:56:22,039
in a way that a person who is a realised soul,

887
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:28,800
is faced by such a person, then the Kundalini spontaneously rises.

888
00:56:29,001 --> 00:56:36,608
Just like in the womb of the Mother Earth if you put any seed,

889
00:56:36,809 --> 00:56:41,431
spontaneously it sprouts because it's a living process.

890
00:56:41,676 --> 00:56:44,648
And it passes through the six chakras.

891
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:47,873
The seventh is the last chakra, which is the pelvic,

892
00:56:48,107 --> 00:56:49,575
which helps the pelvic plexus.

893
00:56:49,776 --> 00:56:52,027
So it doesn't play any part,

894
00:56:52,228 --> 00:56:56,093
means sex does not play any part in this. You become like a child.

895
00:56:56,294 --> 00:56:58,619
And the Kundalini passes through six centres

896
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,870
ultimately the sixth one is here,

897
00:57:01,071 --> 00:57:06,255
which we call as Sahasrara, meaning thousand petaled lotus.

898
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,692
But actually it is the limbic area,

899
00:57:08,893 --> 00:57:13,269
and at the apex of limbic area here, at the fontanel bone area,

900
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,761
It pierces through,

901
00:57:14,962 --> 00:57:16,423
and you actually start feeling

902
00:57:16,624 --> 00:57:19,010
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

903
00:57:19,211 --> 00:57:21,105
Actually start feeling like that.

904
00:57:21,306 --> 00:57:24,377
So, it just sprouts by itself,

905
00:57:24,528 --> 00:57:27,350
it is a spontaneous happening.

906
00:57:31,218 --> 00:57:33,779
Did you understand?

907
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:37,196
You are from the country of Krishna, You should know many things.

908
00:57:37,397 --> 00:57:40,345
After coming here, you people have forgotten God.

909
00:57:41,182 --> 00:57:42,364
Is it true or not?
