00:00:00.508 --> 00:00:06.674
Public Program, Istanbul, Turkey, 1994-07-01

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:17.706
I bow to all the seekers of truth,

00:00:22.777 --> 00:00:29.850
at the very [UNCLEAR] we have to know the truth is what it is.

00:00:35.204 --> 00:00:37.338
We cannot change it.

00:00:39.565 --> 00:00:41.645
We cannot describe it.

00:00:44.317 --> 00:00:48.753
It is, it has been and it will be.

00:00:55.757 --> 00:01:04.252
Only thing is that we can feel it on our central nervous system,

00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:09.130
when you become the spirit.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.899
It has been said in all the scriptures

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:30.441
that you are to be born again,

00:01:37.681 --> 00:01:44.725
that you have to become a wali and [UNCLEAR]

00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:51.009
in the Quran.

00:01:53.326 --> 00:01:56.064
Kundalini is called Assas (foundation)

00:02:00.674 --> 00:02:04.372
My father has translated Quran in Hindi

00:02:12.847 --> 00:02:15.307
and sometimes [UNCLEAR]

00:02:15.331 --> 00:02:20.235
there are many misinterpretation in every religion.

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:33.658
Because any religion if it becomes money oriented

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:39.394
or power oriented, it loses its power.

00:02:50.067 --> 00:02:53.368
But all religions are spirit oriented.

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.546
You had a great leader Ataturk, Mustafa Kemal Pasha

00:03:09.256 --> 00:03:10.794
who was a realized soul.

00:03:16.058 --> 00:03:22.593
And I read his life [UNCLEAR] twelve years, [UNCLEAR]

00:03:27.621 --> 00:03:31.176
But people don’t understand him sometimes.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:42.406
For all saints and Sufis who were real Sufis,

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:46.625
it is very difficult to explain

00:03:47.296 --> 00:03:50.240
what they are enjoying.

00:04:02.692 --> 00:04:06.946
We had a saint in India Kabir, he was Muslim.

00:04:07.054 --> 00:04:11.395
And He said how am I to explain everybody is blind.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:30.737
And this blindness is there because there is general ignorance.

00:04:49.482 --> 00:04:55.219
This ignorance can be removed through this Kundalini awakening.

00:05:05.231 --> 00:05:13.140
Now the truth is that you are not this body, this mind,

00:05:13.904 --> 00:05:19.115
this  intellect, ego, conditioning.

00:05:27.984 --> 00:05:30.944
But you are pure spirit.

00:05:35.228 --> 00:05:38.132
And the second truth is

00:05:38.141 --> 00:05:46.013
that there is a all-pervading power of divine love.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:00.024
which is called Ruh

00:06:05.674 --> 00:06:10.120
So you have to reconnected with that.

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:19.057
Unless and until you have this connection

00:06:19.855 --> 00:06:23.960
you cannot understand yourself.

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.487
These centres about you, they have told you

00:06:39.512 --> 00:06:44.012
where created during evolutionary process within us.

00:06:55.205 --> 00:07:00.268
God Almighty is the greatest creator.

00:07:04.396 --> 00:07:08.943
And the way he had created us delicately,

00:07:09.434 --> 00:07:11.815
we have to understand

00:07:12.149 --> 00:07:18.803
that only thing we have to go to the last stage.

00:07:30.591 --> 00:07:36.162
Surprisingly in Turkey there has been so many Sufis.

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.113
Sufi word comes from saf.

00:07:45.112 --> 00:07:48.064
Saf. Saf means clean.

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:51.648
That is my name also.

00:07:56.037 --> 00:07:58.862
So how do we become saf.

00:08:01.924 --> 00:08:05.765
We have physical problems, emotional problems,

00:08:05.873 --> 00:08:09.444
we have social problems, political problem,

00:08:09.478 --> 00:08:11.541
all kind of problems.

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:22.714
Now these problems come to you,

00:08:22.859 --> 00:08:26.073
because there are problems in your centres.

00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:36.981
But when the kundalini rises

00:08:37.127 --> 00:08:40.065
she passes through these centres.

00:08:46.569 --> 00:08:49.528
This kundalini is your own mother,

00:08:52.377 --> 00:08:54.428
your own individual mother.

00:08:58.152 --> 00:09:01.041
She has been with you in ages.

00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:09.532
But people did not know about it.

00:09:12.324 --> 00:09:15.815
Greeks little bit know of course I will say.

00:09:20.349 --> 00:09:27.827
And this work was done in India also for very few people.

00:09:37.451 --> 00:09:42.326
So in these modern times it is already predicted.

00:09:56.179 --> 00:10:01.417
That there will be a mass realization of people

00:10:11.542 --> 00:10:14.074
For this you can’t pay.

00:10:19.108 --> 00:10:21.338
This is your own power.

00:10:23.492 --> 00:10:25.119
It is potential.

00:10:27.432 --> 00:10:30.277
We use our brain very fractional

00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:37.558
 also our heart.

00:10:39.532 --> 00:10:42.263
But after this happening

00:10:42.806 --> 00:10:46.171
you know about these centres.

00:10:55.846 --> 00:11:00.569
All the problems of the world mostly come from human beings.

00:11:07.924 --> 00:11:12.558
And the problems of human beings come from these centres.

00:11:19.552 --> 00:11:24.357
Somehow you can put these centres

00:11:25.051 --> 00:11:27.161
into proper shape,

00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:29.330
life could be different.

00:11:40.975 --> 00:11:43.711
Now these problems

00:11:44.067 --> 00:11:48.945
which we think are great and global are nothing.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.659
People ask me about peace.

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:09.683
Now we have about 65 nations who are practising Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:15.977
Especially Russia,

00:12:17.443 --> 00:12:20.059
they have never heard about even God.

00:12:23.956 --> 00:12:31.443
But there are some [UNCLEAR] something like that.

00:12:43.239 --> 00:12:47.276
They are very intelligent and like a clean seat.

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:56.422
I am surprise that in democratic countries,

00:12:56.433 --> 00:12:59.036
it has been [UNCLEAR] demonocracy.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.500
For example when I go to America my husband says

00:13:10.524 --> 00:13:13.876
you [UNCLEAR] everything, no ornaments, nothing.

00:13:20.744 --> 00:13:21.998
Can you imagine,

00:13:22.014 --> 00:13:24.736
the greatest democracy full of violence?

00:13:33.818 --> 00:13:37.775
And it is western culture I have seen it through and through.

00:13:44.624 --> 00:13:46.835
Same in England,

00:13:46.846 --> 00:13:49.425
the parents kill their own children.

00:13:53.744 --> 00:13:59.151
75% children who are killed, 
who died

00:13:59.176 --> 00:14:01.654
because of their parents.
Can you believe this?

00:14:08.385 --> 00:14:11.882
I don’t know, how they can call themselves higher races.

00:14:17.156 --> 00:14:20.227
Higher races do not take the killings.

00:14:25.017 --> 00:14:28.633
To me that very stupid also.

00:14:32.126 --> 00:14:37.388
Now take out this Elizabeth Lady,

00:14:41.474 --> 00:14:43.825
she married eight times,

00:14:45.940 --> 00:14:47.662
very inauspicious.

00:14:50.167 --> 00:14:54.350
And then she married a boy who is 20 years younger than her.

00:14:58.566 --> 00:15:03.591
And 4.000 people go to watch her going for honeymoon.

00:15:08.667 --> 00:15:11.823
And there are helicopters, ten helicopters

00:15:11.864 --> 00:15:14.371
covering round to take her photograph

00:15:18.291 --> 00:15:20.616
and some of them [UNCLEAR] down

00:15:23.483 --> 00:15:24.882
to take the photograph.

00:15:26.408 --> 00:15:29.594
And they fall on people and on trees.

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:35.870
Indians maybe poorer

00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:41.278
but much wiser, you won't buy one Indian watching this nonsense.

00:15:49.461 --> 00:15:54.592
If you see the extreme is stupid thing have reached,

00:15:54.797 --> 00:15:58.590
you will be amaze even their music now they are saying

00:15:58.598 --> 00:16:00.566
it is up to brain cells.

00:16:11.552 --> 00:16:16.189
In my own other life which I met

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.580
many people many elit, sophisticate.

00:16:28.410 --> 00:16:32.681
And what they talk among themselves is nonsense.

00:16:40.918 --> 00:16:43.650
They talk about drugs, ladies,

00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.749
try this drug, it is very cheap now in bargain.

00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:00.271
And I have to warn you,

00:17:00.696 --> 00:17:03.687
don’t take to their stupid culture.

00:17:14.893 --> 00:17:20.704
Now at least you are, I think 10, 20 years behind.

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:30.016
Because now the women are looking nude and men are also looking nude

00:17:31.306 --> 00:17:32.861
in the advance countries.

00:17:39.459 --> 00:17:42.746
And their all market are fall  down like that.

00:17:47.156 --> 00:17:49.553
They have lost their jobs,

00:17:49.578 --> 00:17:51.776
they have lost their [UNCLEAR].

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:54.176
They have big mess.

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:05.888
They have no shame, nothing.

00:18:10.436 --> 00:18:14.111
And they have no idea of in moral life.

00:18:20.128 --> 00:18:24.646
Without morality a society is finished.

00:18:29.296 --> 00:18:33.288
They followed this stupid Freud.

00:18:36.757 --> 00:18:41.748
When I told them against him they never agree with me very much.

00:18:45.156 --> 00:18:47.695
Now they are known.

00:18:50.127 --> 00:18:52.999
That Freud,

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:57.282
 [UNCLEAR] Freud, one book I have read.

00:19:03.942 --> 00:19:08.333
And another one was Down Fall of Freudian Emperor.

00:19:12.518 --> 00:19:15.414
The base of Freudian principle is

00:19:15.431 --> 00:19:18.590
that you have bad relation with your own mother.

00:19:29.693 --> 00:19:31.891
Thank God it is [UNCLEAR] to India.

00:19:34.856 --> 00:19:38.341
Otherwise they would [UNCLEAR].

00:19:40.537 --> 00:19:42.894
We can’t stand this nonsense.

00:19:47.496 --> 00:19:50.527
There is no wisdom in saint,

00:19:50.819 --> 00:19:55.350
such horrible thing and then do you believe to this.

00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:06.341
As you say pak,

00:20:06.881 --> 00:20:08.666
they are not pak,

00:20:11.219 --> 00:20:13.083
pure,

00:20:16.066 --> 00:20:17.772
absolutely.

00:20:17.973 --> 00:20:20.686
And if they combine together,

00:20:20.714 --> 00:20:24.747
if I they are collective, they take to something horrible.

00:20:30.263 --> 00:20:33.114
They take to alcohol, drugs,

00:20:33.139 --> 00:20:38.046
 [UNCLEAR] Michael Jackson business, I mean.

00:20:48.165 --> 00:20:52.601
So what I feel that Turkish must stand back and see

00:20:52.699 --> 00:20:55.214
what is happening in this mad world.

00:21:01.393 --> 00:21:05.671
I was surprised that you also import food for your country,

00:21:05.687 --> 00:21:07.975
I mean Indians won’t do that.

00:21:15.860 --> 00:21:19.019
What I knew about Turkish people,

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:22.047
they are very patriot that what I knew.

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:31.214
You come back your [UNCLEAR, wrong] first of all

00:21:31.225 --> 00:21:33.319
by through Sahaja Yoga you will.

00:21:38.344 --> 00:21:41.091
You will have self-knowledge

00:21:41.116 --> 00:21:43.726
by which you will be self-confident.

00:21:51.136 --> 00:21:53.651
You will have peace in your heart

00:21:53.693 --> 00:21:56.201
so you will be peaceful people

00:21:56.221 --> 00:21:59.927
and enjoying the blessing of your spirit.

00:22:10.004 --> 00:22:13.186
With the light of the Spirit

00:22:13.343 --> 00:22:17.604
you can feel your own centres on your fingertips.

00:22:29.302 --> 00:22:33.542
You can feel the centres of others on your fingertips.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:42.140
Whatever race you are,

00:22:43.910 --> 00:22:45.573
whatever country you are,

00:22:47.177 --> 00:22:49.091
you become a universal being.

00:22:51.691 --> 00:22:55.708
Sitting down here you can feel anybody vibrations,

00:23:04.173 --> 00:23:08.872
because your computer is connected with this all-pervading power.

00:23:15.504 --> 00:23:19.210
Which thinks, understands,

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:22.125
cooperates, coordinates.

00:23:29.097 --> 00:23:31.549
It is very efficient , very efficient.

00:23:33.308 --> 00:23:35.903
Above all it loves.

00:23:40.751 --> 00:23:42.664
It is compassion.

00:23:44.166 --> 00:23:45.832
It forgives you,

00:23:48.139 --> 00:23:49.448
looks after

00:23:50.865 --> 00:23:52.610
every moment.

00:23:55.171 --> 00:23:58.210
Thus you enter into the kingdom of God.

00:24:03.362 --> 00:24:07.792
Whatever is written about cennet (heaven) it is a fact.

00:24:11.864 --> 00:24:14.974
And that is what you feel you enjoy.

00:24:22.233 --> 00:24:23.898
If you are that,

00:24:23.923 --> 00:24:27.811
if you are so much

00:24:28.261 --> 00:24:32.105
empowered within yourself why not get to it.

00:24:41.562 --> 00:24:48.709
They say that this what about this guru,

00:24:48.734 --> 00:24:50.839
what about that one why [UNCLEAR].

00:24:50.855 --> 00:24:53.839
You become your own guru, your own master.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:11.315
Because we don't take money they are very much against us all off them.

00:25:20.677 --> 00:25:23.274
It is your right to have this.

00:25:29.141 --> 00:25:31.482
And once you get it,

00:25:31.585 --> 00:25:34.468
you will be amazed at yourself.

00:25:41.209 --> 00:25:43.542
Supposing you are an artist,

00:25:46.565 --> 00:25:50.010
you become a much greater artist.

00:25:54.311 --> 00:25:57.683
You must have heard the name of “Hamzat Ali” from India

00:26:04.584 --> 00:26:10.302
and also we have many people who play tabla

00:26:10.327 --> 00:26:13.439
[UNCLEAR] and all these people.

00:26:18.129 --> 00:26:20.541
They are all Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:25.781 --> 00:26:29.947
And after Sahaja Yoga only they became so famous.

00:26:40.566 --> 00:26:43.685
Many diseases are cured by Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:43.709 --> 00:26:45.232
many diseases,

00:26:49.416 --> 00:26:51.241
without penny.

00:26:52.877 --> 00:26:55.950
Diagnosis you don’t have to go through the

00:26:55.975 --> 00:27:00.937
 [UNCLEAR] of diagnosis and doctors.

00:27:08.511 --> 00:27:10.685
Your own power cures you.

00:27:14.680 --> 00:27:18.497
Now in India there are 3, I think now 4 doctors

00:27:18.534 --> 00:27:23.759
who have got their MD after evidence in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:31.054 --> 00:27:35.643
Definitely cancer has been cured in Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:40.174 --> 00:27:41.324
so many diseases,

00:27:42.745 --> 00:27:47.183
because these chakras are the fundamentals of our being.

00:27:53.663 --> 00:27:56.202
If you know how to correct you get cured.

00:28:04.190 --> 00:28:06.079
And you can cure.

00:28:08.574 --> 00:28:10.883
You can help others.

00:28:16.219 --> 00:28:18.631
Now our attention

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:22.159
which is all the time wobbly like this.

00:28:27.776 --> 00:28:30.009
It becomes innocent.

00:28:34.679 --> 00:28:39.524
And whenever such a person puts the attention

00:28:40.226 --> 00:28:41.998
it cures.

00:28:53.447 --> 00:28:55.026
It gives peace,

00:28:56.354 --> 00:28:57.687
it gives joy.

00:28:59.295 --> 00:29:01.461
You don’t have to give up anything.

00:29:05.024 --> 00:29:08.119
Not to become a sanyasi or something.

00:29:14.629 --> 00:29:18.360
Whatever will not suit you do yourself give up.

00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:28.171
I give an example like I am holding a snake in my hand

00:29:31.631 --> 00:29:34.027
and I am very obstinate.

00:29:41.905 --> 00:29:45.206
So if somebody says and  I am in darkness.

00:29:48.222 --> 00:29:51.079
Somebody says there is a snake in your hand;

00:29:51.095 --> 00:29:53.595
I say no, it is a rope.

00:30:03.086 --> 00:30:06.443
Till that snake bites me, I will say it is a rope,

00:30:14.589 --> 00:30:18.980
but as soon as I see some light,

00:30:19.013 --> 00:30:20.607
I will throw.

00:30:29.033 --> 00:30:32.366
because than you realize what is destructive for you

00:30:37.386 --> 00:30:39.163
and what is constructive for you.

00:30:43.257 --> 00:30:45.431
It every way it helps.

00:30:47.959 --> 00:30:50.617
We have some hippies to begin with,

00:30:51.048 --> 00:30:52.770
now they are very rich people.

00:31:01.797 --> 00:31:04.162
So the financial problems also can solve.

00:31:08.878 --> 00:31:10.624
Many people say only worship God,

00:31:10.649 --> 00:31:15.006
we do this, we used to do so much namaz still we are pure.

00:31:25.084 --> 00:31:29.058
Or some of them say that we are doing all kind of immoral things

00:31:29.066 --> 00:31:31.970
and we go to the mosque what is the use.

00:31:38.609 --> 00:31:40.529
We cannot control ourselves.

00:31:46.867 --> 00:31:49.751
But after realization

00:31:52.530 --> 00:31:55.168
you really become rightest.

00:31:59.112 --> 00:32:01.064
Nobody has to tell you,

00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:05.387
automatically become like this.

00:32:09.225 --> 00:32:12.171
But you must have desire,

00:32:15.296 --> 00:32:16.775
pure desire

00:32:19.597 --> 00:32:21.287
to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:28.093
Sahaj means born with you.

00:32:33.349 --> 00:32:37.238
Yogi means the one who has connection with the Divine.

00:32:44.147 --> 00:32:47.392
Than you can amaze how many powers you have.

00:32:52.457 --> 00:32:54.759
You can raise the kundalini of others.

00:32:56.740 --> 00:32:58.581
You can give them realization.

00:33:01.198 --> 00:33:03.983
You can, I mean so many things happen to them.

00:33:04.008 --> 00:33:07.200
I am surprised how many talents they have.

00:33:13.345 --> 00:33:16.003
They always say Mother you have done it, no, no, no

00:33:16.027 --> 00:33:18.932
it is your own mother, your own Kundalini.

00:33:30.483 --> 00:33:34.768
Now there are so many things that happen to you.

00:33:35.145 --> 00:33:38.306
That people started writing to me

00:33:38.346 --> 00:33:40.663
what miracles they have seen.

00:33:49.749 --> 00:33:53.033
So I sent them to very intelligent Sahaja Yogi

00:33:53.058 --> 00:33:55.259
that you better write them down.

00:34:05.685 --> 00:34:10.108
Within one month he telephone to me, the miracles have come up this much.

00:34:19.032 --> 00:34:21.596
I don’t know [UNCLEAR] which one to write.

00:34:24.958 --> 00:34:27.442
Than you realize there is God.

00:34:33.308 --> 00:34:37.744
Otherwise whether you believe in God, not believe in God is blindness.

00:34:44.323 --> 00:34:47.092
People will say how to say there is God, you cannot prove

00:34:47.117 --> 00:34:48.317
but we can do.

00:34:57.081 --> 00:34:58.652
Above all

00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.703
you start swimming in the ocean of joy.

00:35:11.169 --> 00:35:15.329
You develop your balance, 
your satisfactions

00:35:15.814 --> 00:35:20.983
and you just enjoy yourself.

00:35:31.904 --> 00:35:34.346
You are full of energy see I am 70 years of age,

00:35:34.371 --> 00:35:37.867
I don't think anybody elderly  like myself sit here.

00:35:49.261 --> 00:35:53.461
It is so relax, no strain, no stress, nothing.

00:36:01.202 --> 00:36:04.471
Joy is singular.

00:36:10.162 --> 00:36:13.479
It is not happiness and unhappiness.

00:36:21.231 --> 00:36:26.206
And your ego is pampered when you feel happy.

00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:35.957
When it is puncture you feel unhappy.

00:36:40.115 --> 00:36:42.789
But joy you enjoy everything.

00:36:52.279 --> 00:36:55.613
You enjoy also stupid people,

00:36:58.441 --> 00:36:59.624
mad people

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:03.557
and Divine,

00:37:07.404 --> 00:37:11.509
and then self-respect, 
self-confidence

00:37:14.897 --> 00:37:18.151
which is compassion, extremely compassion,

00:37:21.206 --> 00:37:23.801
at the same time dynamic.

00:37:26.815 --> 00:37:28.481
That is what you are

00:37:32.527 --> 00:37:34.042
and why not become.

00:37:38.293 --> 00:37:42.172
In one small lecture I don’t know how much I can do it.

00:37:49.170 --> 00:37:51.926
Only in English language

00:37:51.951 --> 00:37:55.785
I must have done 4 – 5.000 lectures only.

00:38:01.365 --> 00:38:05.844
But also this is all mental acrobat

00:38:11.193 --> 00:38:16.291
like you have a sign this is this hotel.

00:38:22.811 --> 00:38:25.620
But you have to enter inside.

00:38:32.656 --> 00:38:34.925
No use just reading,

00:38:37.258 --> 00:38:41.135
those who just one reading morning till evening have reached nowhere

00:38:50.212 --> 00:38:54.896
It is to follow what it is.

00:39:00.075 --> 00:39:02.251
and you have to enter in,

00:39:05.363 --> 00:39:07.024
which is very simple.

00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:13.018
Especially with Muslims are I have seen it works very [UNCLEAR] well.

00:39:19.295 --> 00:39:22.035
In the Bazar we gave realization to someone.

00:39:31.361 --> 00:39:34.791
Only thing you have to have pure desire.

00:39:42.692 --> 00:39:44.202
Arzu (desire) we also say,

00:39:49.438 --> 00:39:53.900
so many words are like Indian language here.

00:40:08.672 --> 00:40:11.395
So now we say, we have to come to the sahil (beach).

00:40:19.137 --> 00:40:21.756
We have had a lots of problems,

00:40:24.643 --> 00:40:27.174
but there is solution,

00:40:29.749 --> 00:40:30.749
believe me,

00:40:34.837 --> 00:40:37.027
so if they  are have a session.

00:40:38.984 --> 00:40:41.420
Now there is one thing I have to tell you

00:40:41.494 --> 00:40:46.075
that I cannot force on you spirituality.

00:40:52.912 --> 00:40:56.229
You have to ask from your heart.

00:41:06.219 --> 00:41:10.077
You can take out your shoes, if you don’t mind, it helps a lot.

00:41:28.482 --> 00:41:30.438
It is very simple.

00:41:45.698 --> 00:41:49.578
I must say there are three conditions.

00:41:54.557 --> 00:41:56.533
The first one is

00:41:57.995 --> 00:42:06.290
that you should not feel guilty for anything.

00:42:14.132 --> 00:42:17.312
Because I find people, [UNCLEAR] God how will I get it,

00:42:17.336 --> 00:42:19.374
because I have done this sin, that sin.

00:42:19.382 --> 00:42:21.120
There is no sin for you.

00:42:30.829 --> 00:42:35.180
So please forgive yourself fully,

00:42:39.909 --> 00:42:43.373
 because in modern life it is a fashion.

00:42:50.114 --> 00:42:52.994
I mean if we have done anything wrong,

00:42:53.616 --> 00:42:55.615
 that is the past.

00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.318
You should face it.

00:43:06.267 --> 00:43:08.330
But don’t carry it with you.

00:43:15.683 --> 00:43:17.952
So the past is past, finished.

00:43:21.036 --> 00:43:22.908
The future doesn’t exist.

00:43:27.061 --> 00:43:29.669
What is reality is present.

00:43:33.406 --> 00:43:37.739
When we are thinking, we are thinking about the past or about the future.

00:43:44.193 --> 00:43:46.359
What about present.

00:43:48.418 --> 00:43:51.612
If present you don’t have any thoughts

00:43:55.707 --> 00:43:59.104
and that is the time when spirituality moves.

00:44:11.215 --> 00:44:14.544
So the second condition is

00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:18.004
 that you have to forgive everyone.

00:44:23.403 --> 00:44:27.062
Don’t have to think about it, that is a headache.

00:44:33.067 --> 00:44:36.733
Whether you forgive or don’t forgive, what do you do?

00:44:40.961 --> 00:44:44.369
But when you don’t forgive then you play in wrong hands

00:44:48.938 --> 00:44:51.517
and you torture yourself for nothing at all.

00:44:55.802 --> 00:44:57.626
So it is a myth.

00:44:59.868 --> 00:45:02.885
And the one who has troubled you nicely [UNCLEAR, happy]

00:45:09.576 --> 00:45:12.094
and on his behalf you are torturing yourself.

00:45:17.271 --> 00:45:19.373
So please give up that myth.

00:45:21.900 --> 00:45:24.432
And I say even don’t think about it.

00:45:31.267 --> 00:45:33.991
These two conditions are very important.

00:45:37.998 --> 00:45:42.863
If you feel guilty then you catch here, on this centre, left side.

00:45:49.416 --> 00:45:56.394
This catch gives you spondylitis, angina.

00:46:14.323 --> 00:46:19.624
And thirdly it is very important

00:46:19.628 --> 00:46:21.308
that it should open,

00:46:25.724 --> 00:46:28.041
because the kundalini has to pass through it.

00:46:32.331 --> 00:46:35.144
So please don’t condemn yourself for anything,

00:46:37.901 --> 00:46:40.218
please don’t feel guilty.

00:46:44.027 --> 00:46:47.141
If you had done anything wrong, you could have been in jail or

00:46:47.166 --> 00:46:48.490
 how could it be?

00:46:54.270 --> 00:46:56.389
So now don’t feel guilty.

00:46:57.924 --> 00:47:00.312
I think it is [UNCLEAR, rather]

00:47:00.436 --> 00:47:01.626
please don’t feel guilty.

00:47:01.651 --> 00:47:04.848
I can feel it you all [UNCLEAR]

00:47:18.709 --> 00:47:22.010
Because of that you feeling sick also for nothing at all.

00:47:28.568 --> 00:47:31.179
Now the third condition is

00:47:31.204 --> 00:47:35.586
that you should be all absolutely confident

00:47:35.618 --> 00:47:38.406
that you will get your self-realization.

00:47:50.076 --> 00:47:52.313
Just be fully confident.

00:47:55.335 --> 00:48:01.995
Now what we are going to do is to nourish our centres,

00:48:05.853 --> 00:48:07.329
our own centres

00:48:08.956 --> 00:48:10.919
which we will show you how we do it.

00:48:16.477 --> 00:48:18.157
First you see.

00:48:26.018 --> 00:48:30.224
So first we put the left hands towards me, like this.

00:48:36.117 --> 00:48:39.029
It is just like namaz, I am telling you, put left hand toward me.

00:48:42.169 --> 00:48:46.899
Now this is the symbolic that you want your realization,

00:48:46.904 --> 00:48:49.371
because this is the power of desire.

00:48:56.789 --> 00:49:02.083
Now so that’s why because this the left side is the power of desire

00:49:02.108 --> 00:49:05.270
and the right side is the power of action.

00:49:05.295 --> 00:49:07.042
We keep both the feet apart.

00:49:17.946 --> 00:49:20.065
You can keep comfortably on your lap [UNCLEAR].

00:49:23.334 --> 00:49:24.992
It is working everywhere.

00:49:31.635 --> 00:49:34.452
Now we use the right hand to nourish our centres.

00:49:40.350 --> 00:49:43.850
Unfortunately this is an air condition now.

00:49:48.978 --> 00:49:52.422
And when you start feeling the cool breeze

00:49:52.910 --> 00:49:56.275
of this all-pervading power, people doubt also.

00:50:03.778 --> 00:50:05.731
I think better to [UNCLEAR,close].

00:50:28.124 --> 00:50:29.703
Now

00:50:31.211 --> 00:50:34.657
first we put our hand on our heart.

00:50:40.014 --> 00:50:46.031
So in the heart is the reflection of God or Allah

00:50:46.296 --> 00:50:47.755
as the Ruh.

00:50:55.252 --> 00:51:00.268
Now when you became the spirit,

00:51:00.273 --> 00:51:04.193
in the light of spirit, you know your will.

00:51:18.683 --> 00:51:20.770
So you know

00:51:21.231 --> 00:51:23.841
that you are your master.

00:51:30.831 --> 00:51:33.346
So you on the left side,

00:51:33.371 --> 00:51:35.799
upper portion of your abdomen,

00:51:44.208 --> 00:51:47.527
this is the centre of your mastery,

00:51:55.269 --> 00:51:59.618
mastery as a saint.

00:52:07.925 --> 00:52:09.742
Then we go down

00:52:09.744 --> 00:52:12.196
into the lower portion of our abdomen,

00:52:12.919 --> 00:52:14.442
in the left hand side.

00:52:18.743 --> 00:52:20.735
This is the centre.

00:52:20.954 --> 00:52:22.358
No this side,

00:52:22.374 --> 00:52:24.398
all we are working on left side.

00:52:31.815 --> 00:52:36.323
This is the centre of pure knowledge,

00:52:40.872 --> 00:52:44.006
knowledge about the laws of the Divine.

00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:54.281
Then again we take our hand

00:52:54.321 --> 00:52:57.574
on the upper portion of our abdomen on the left hand side.

00:53:04.237 --> 00:53:07.967
This is the centre as I told you of your mastery.

00:53:12.873 --> 00:53:15.674
This has created by great [UNCLEAR]

00:53:15.852 --> 00:53:19.772
also every kind of religion, masters.

00:53:30.099 --> 00:53:32.138
Then you take it on your heart

00:53:34.035 --> 00:53:35.910
where resides the Spirit.

00:53:39.989 --> 00:53:43.768
Then you take it in the

00:53:44.308 --> 00:53:47.215
corner of your neck and your shoulder

00:53:51.926 --> 00:53:54.013
and turn your head your right.

00:53:57.105 --> 00:53:59.883
I have already told you about this centre.

00:54:02.453 --> 00:54:04.858
You catch it when you feel guilty

00:54:08.871 --> 00:54:10.362
even now it is there.

00:54:13.227 --> 00:54:14.528
Alright,

00:54:14.576 --> 00:54:21.413
now you take your right hand across on forehead like this.

00:54:24.652 --> 00:54:29.271
Here you have to forgive everyone

00:54:29.282 --> 00:54:31.339
in general without thinking of [UNCLEAR, it].

00:54:36.532 --> 00:54:37.962
Please put down your head.

00:54:41.461 --> 00:54:46.413
Now you have to take your right hand on the backside of your head

00:54:46.435 --> 00:54:49.133
and push back your head as far as possible.

00:54:53.711 --> 00:54:55.742
Now, at this centre push back.

00:54:59.170 --> 00:55:01.558
Without feeling guilty,

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.085
without counting your mistakes

00:55:04.109 --> 00:55:06.428
just for your satisfaction,

00:55:06.436 --> 00:55:10.580
you have to ask forgiveness from this Divine power.

00:55:21.087 --> 00:55:25.674
Now stretch your hand fully, the palm,

00:55:28.469 --> 00:55:29.858
this is the last centre.

00:55:31.868 --> 00:55:37.236
So you put the centre of your palm on top of your head.

00:55:43.541 --> 00:55:46.326
Now push back your fingers, very important

00:55:50.374 --> 00:55:52.143
and please put down your head.

00:55:54.536 --> 00:55:58.480
Now move your skull seven times,

00:55:58.945 --> 00:56:01.008
slowly clockwise,

00:56:11.330 --> 00:56:12.671
push back your fingers.

00:56:23.138 --> 00:56:25.327
No, push it

00:56:25.354 --> 00:56:29.132
not to just move hand but push your skull.

00:56:35.920 --> 00:56:37.484
That’s all you have to do.

00:56:42.286 --> 00:56:46.420
Now, please again put your feet apart.

00:56:51.768 --> 00:56:53.532
Put your hand like this

00:56:55.591 --> 00:56:57.511
as we do for namaz.

00:57:02.408 --> 00:57:04.837
And put your right hand on your heart.

00:57:09.719 --> 00:57:12.012
And now close your eyes.

00:57:15.868 --> 00:57:18.145
You should take out your spectacles

00:57:18.170 --> 00:57:20.923
because it will help your [UNCLEAR] centers.

00:57:27.839 --> 00:57:38.018
I have to ask you to ask me a question about yourself.

00:57:49.948 --> 00:57:52.060
It is a very fundamental question.

00:57:54.985 --> 00:57:59.662
You can call me Mother or you can call me Shri Mataji whatever you like.

00:58:06.579 --> 00:58:11.388
So in your heart ask question three times,

00:58:11.412 --> 00:58:16.128
 “Mother, am I the Spirit?” 
Ask this question three times.

00:58:25.848 --> 00:58:28.133
I have already told you

00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.504
that when you become the spirit,

00:58:31.528 --> 00:58:34.585
you become your guide, your master.

00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:47.161
So now please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

00:58:51.958 --> 00:58:53.188
on the left hand side.

00:58:56.016 --> 00:58:59.478
Here you ask another fundamental question,

00:59:02.771 --> 00:59:07.476
 “Mother, am I my own master?”
 three times.

00:59:17.197 --> 00:59:18.958
I have to tell you

00:59:18.982 --> 00:59:23.540
that I cannot force

00:59:24.114 --> 00:59:26.655
Divine knowledge on you.

00:59:33.429 --> 00:59:35.778
You have to ask for it.

00:59:40.991 --> 00:59:45.905
So now please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen,

00:59:48.261 --> 00:59:49.538
press it.

00:59:50.836 --> 00:59:54.415
And here you ask six times

00:59:55.944 --> 00:59:59.007
because this centre has got six petals,

01:00:02.261 --> 01:00:09.034
 “Mother, please give me pure knowledge”.

01:00:24.468 --> 01:00:28.602
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

01:00:28.607 --> 01:00:32.146
this kundalini your mother starts rising

01:00:39.842 --> 01:00:43.516
like a prelude in the seed.

01:00:50.175 --> 01:00:53.928
So now you have to nourish your upper centres

01:00:53.933 --> 01:00:56.518
with your self-confidence.

01:01:02.562 --> 01:01:06.688
So please take your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

01:01:06.693 --> 01:01:08.930
on the left hand side and press it.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.854
Here you have to say

01:01:17.878 --> 01:01:21.266
with full confidence 10 times,

01:01:21.310 --> 01:01:27.312
 “Mother, I am my own master”,

01:01:35.214 --> 01:01:36.753
10 times.

01:01:43.452 --> 01:01:47.263
I have already told you at the very out center

01:01:47.266 --> 01:01:52.204
that you are not this body, this mind,

01:01:52.229 --> 01:01:58.398
this ego, this conditionings but you are the pure Spirit.

01:02:12.118 --> 01:02:16.110
So now please raise your right hand on your heart,

01:02:19.944 --> 01:02:23.388
and say with full confidence 12 times,

01:02:23.406 --> 01:02:27.194
 “Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:02:45.065 --> 01:02:48.303
I have already told you

01:02:48.557 --> 01:02:51.242
that you are not to feel guilty.

01:02:55.989 --> 01:03:00.713
This all-pervading power is the ocean of knowledge;

01:03:06.276 --> 01:03:09.861
it is the ocean of love and peace

01:03:16.693 --> 01:03:20.014
but above all is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:26.799
Whatever mistakes, you might have committed,

01:03:26.824 --> 01:03:31.024
are easily resolved with the power of compassion.

01:03:40.141 --> 01:03:43.643
So you surrender it that is Islam

01:03:43.667 --> 01:03:47.035
to surrender to this power of love.

01:03:54.769 --> 01:03:59.213
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and shoulder

01:03:59.245 --> 01:04:01.724
and turn your head to your right.

01:04:09.099 --> 01:04:12.352
Here you have to say 16 times,

01:04:12.371 --> 01:04:16.072
 “Mother I am not guilty at all”.

01:04:25.951 --> 01:04:28.848
Also I have told you

01:04:28.882 --> 01:04:34.347
that whether you forgive or don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

01:04:40.748 --> 01:04:44.721
But if you don’t forgive then you play into wrong hands

01:04:48.198 --> 01:04:50.774
and you make yourself miserable.

01:04:54.467 --> 01:04:58.806
This centre is a very constructive centre.

01:05:02.181 --> 01:05:07.300
And if you do not forgive all of them, this centre will not open.

01:05:11.095 --> 01:05:16.525
As it is you have tortured yourself by not forgiving.

01:05:19.850 --> 01:05:25.064
And at this moment if you do not forgive the centre won’t open.

01:05:31.011 --> 01:05:36.003
Also you will miss the chance,

01:05:36.043 --> 01:05:38.228
the great chance of realization.

01:05:48.599 --> 01:05:53.067
Please raise your hand on top of your forehead across

01:05:53.092 --> 01:05:55.167
and please put down your head.

01:06:00.342 --> 01:06:02.088
Here you have to say

01:06:02.113 --> 01:06:05.756
not how many times but from your heart,

01:06:05.781 --> 01:06:11.206
 “Mother I forgive everyone in general”.

01:06:21.404 --> 01:06:22.808
Say it from your heart.

01:06:30.429 --> 01:06:34.909
Now please take your right hand on the backside of your head

01:06:34.917 --> 01:06:36.988
and push back your head.

01:06:43.452 --> 01:06:48.047
Here without feeling guilty,

01:06:50.539 --> 01:06:52.704
without counting your mistakes,

01:06:54.548 --> 01:06:56.643
just for your satisfaction,

01:06:58.870 --> 01:07:01.579
you have to say again from your heart,

01:07:03.264 --> 01:07:05.291
 “O Divine power,

01:07:08.601 --> 01:07:11.985
please forgive me

01:07:12.010 --> 01:07:16.210
if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly”.

01:07:29.324 --> 01:07:31.125
Now the last centre,

01:07:33.699 --> 01:07:35.662
please stretch your palm

01:07:38.929 --> 01:07:43.287
and put it on the fontanel bone area

01:07:43.312 --> 01:07:45.966
which was a soft bone in your childhood,

01:07:45.991 --> 01:07:48.014
 the centre of the palm.

01:07:54.066 --> 01:07:56.271
Here again

01:07:56.296 --> 01:07:59.676
I cannot force self-realization on you.

01:08:03.616 --> 01:08:06.822
Please bend your head. 
Please bend your head.

01:08:09.461 --> 01:08:13.799
Now move your skull 7 times slowly,

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:17.295
say “Mother please give me self-realization”.

01:08:53.772 --> 01:08:55.795
Now please take down your hands,

01:08:58.809 --> 01:09:01.118
please put both the hands towards me

01:09:04.479 --> 01:09:06.669
and watch me without thinking.

01:09:13.325 --> 01:09:18.142
You may not think,

01:09:18.152 --> 01:09:20.717
there is no thought,

01:09:23.445 --> 01:09:25.246
you are in present.

01:09:28.475 --> 01:09:31.745
Now please put your left hand towards me

01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.186
and right hand also

01:09:38.441 --> 01:09:44.670
and see if you are feeling thoughtlessly aware.

01:09:50.228 --> 01:09:53.092
Now please put you’re your right hand towards me

01:09:53.117 --> 01:09:56.484
and bend your head and see for yourself,

01:09:56.509 --> 01:10:00.782
if there is a cool or a hot breeze, like

01:10:00.807 --> 01:10:05.811
vibrations coming out of your fontanel bone area,

01:10:05.836 --> 01:10:07.551
to the centre of your head.

01:10:23.703 --> 01:10:26.464
Don’t put, please don’t put it on top,

01:10:26.489 --> 01:10:28.181
away from your head.

01:10:33.586 --> 01:10:37.253
Some people get it close and some people get it far.

01:10:44.002 --> 01:10:48.805
Now please put the left hand and again bend your head,

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:50.509
and see for yourself,

01:10:50.534 --> 01:10:55.988
if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your

01:10:56.013 --> 01:10:59.833
 fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:11:04.952 --> 01:11:07.682
Please move your hand.

01:11:16.988 --> 01:11:19.966
If it is hot that means you are not forgiven,

01:11:19.991 --> 01:11:22.286
so even now you should forgive.

01:11:27.249 --> 01:11:30.310
After the heat it will become cool.

01:11:34.621 --> 01:11:38.508
Once again with the right hand, put down your head

01:11:38.533 --> 01:11:41.387
and see for yourself with the left hand

01:11:41.403 --> 01:11:46.120
if there is cool breeze coming out of your head or hot breeze.

01:11:57.516 --> 01:12:01.393
Now raise your hands up in the sky, open your hands

01:12:04.659 --> 01:12:07.115
and ask

01:12:11.306 --> 01:12:13.403
in your heart 3 times

01:12:13.404 --> 01:12:18.177
 “Mother is this the cool breeze of the ruh?”

01:12:24.171 --> 01:12:26.297
or ask a question  “Mother

01:12:26.322 --> 01:12:31.460
is this the all-pervading power of Divine love?”

01:12:37.257 --> 01:12:41.860
in our language, we say 
“is this the Paramchaitanya?”

01:12:48.143 --> 01:12:49.936
Now put down your hands please,

01:12:52.524 --> 01:12:55.066
put your hands like this.

01:12:58.422 --> 01:13:02.683
They have put off the air conditioning.

01:13:03.474 --> 01:13:05.478
All those who are feeling

01:13:05.503 --> 01:13:09.780
cool breeze or hot breeze on their hands,

01:13:09.805 --> 01:13:17.818
on fingertips, palms or out of their fontanel bone area,

01:13:17.835 --> 01:13:19.543
please raise both your hands,

01:13:31.751 --> 01:13:33.377
cool or hot breeze [UNCLEAR].

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.674
both your hands,

01:13:38.685 --> 01:13:42.176
All of you got it, May God bless you.

01:13:45.039 --> 01:13:47.469
So, all of you have it.

01:13:49.958 --> 01:13:51.759
Maybe one or two,

01:13:53.177 --> 01:13:54.574
 they can also get it.

01:13:59.087 --> 01:14:02.531
You will feel extremely peaceful.

01:14:06.843 --> 01:14:09.970
And the joy will start bubbling.

01:14:15.345 --> 01:14:19.043
Now know that for the first time you have felt the ruh.

01:14:23.185 --> 01:14:28.535
But you have to work it out,

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:35.296
the raising of kundalini, at least for few days

01:14:35.392 --> 01:14:39.675
when they are having a follow on to fix the connection.

01:14:55.077 --> 01:14:59.299
So you have to respect the self-realization.

01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:06.952
You don’t have to pay anything.

01:15:09.552 --> 01:15:13.703
But of course you have to give some time for yourself.

01:15:17.947 --> 01:15:21.735
And once you are established, you will be the masters.

01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:33.606
Thank you very much.
