WEBVTT

00:02.325 --> 00:12.452
It is a very important Guru Puja today

00:12.653 --> 00:21.933
because we have completed twenty-five
years of Guru Puja.

00:27.457 --> 00:31.188
(Hindi: "Please put the fan in the rotating
manner".)

00:55.505 --> 01:04.172
Also, it is extremely beautiful

01:04.373 --> 01:16.800
to see so many Sahaja Yogis who are,
really have become, very great.

01:19.347 --> 01:27.594
It’s a question of understanding what
Sahaja Yoga is.

01:27.795 --> 01:32.617
It's a very unique discovery, I feel now,

01:32.818 --> 01:42.620
that people who were seeking the Truth
have found it

01:42.821 --> 01:53.370
and have now got it absolutely on their
central nervous system.

01:54.985 --> 01:58.595
Yes, in some places it’s difficult to
explain

01:58.796 --> 02:02.183
how it has happened, how it has worked out

02:02.384 --> 02:06.983
and how, in these twenty-five years, we
have been able

02:07.184 --> 02:13.638
to achieve this expansion of Sahaja Yoga.

02:16.905 --> 02:25.371
The main thing, I feel, is that you all
should know

02:25.572 --> 02:32.137
that as the tree grows, the roots have
to grow much deeper

02:32.338 --> 02:37.443
and they should spread also. If it doesn't
happen,

02:37.644 --> 02:43.422
the tree cannot be sustained only by Mother
Earth.

02:43.623 --> 02:51.264
So the roots are in your own life, in your
own heart.

02:55.102 --> 02:58.683
When we say we have become our own Guru,

02:58.884 --> 03:04.794
we should really try to find out with our
introspection:

03:04.995 --> 03:09.644
Are we our Guru or not?

03:10.503 --> 03:16.963
Because, before this your mind was on one
side

03:17.164 --> 03:27.009
and your heart was on another side

03:27.210 --> 03:32.755
and your attention was in another
dimension.

03:32.956 --> 03:39.515
So these three things were creating
confusion within you.

03:47.890 --> 03:54.929
If you understand a human being, then you
will be surprised to see

03:55.130 --> 04:03.588
how these three things act separately in a
human being. And sometimes they fight also.

04:03.789 --> 04:07.937
First is your intellect and your mind.

04:08.138 --> 04:14.929
Second is your heart, your feelings, your
emotions.

04:22.924 --> 04:31.338
And the third one is your attention.

04:33.146 --> 04:39.015
In these modern times, this confusion is
the worst

04:39.216 --> 04:43.564
because all the time your attention is
outside.

04:43.765 --> 04:50.605
It could be towards beautiful things, or
beautiful women, or beautiful men or

04:50.806 --> 04:57.234
all kinds of nonsensical way of wasting
your energy.

04:57.435 --> 05:03.496
Such attention then is absolutely like
a horse which is let loose.

05:03.697 --> 05:06.759
You cannot control such an attention.

05:06.960 --> 05:14.847
And this attention runs wild from one
to another.

05:15.252 --> 05:18.914
It’s a fashion also. It’s sort of a very
popular thing

05:19.115 --> 05:23.376
to keep the attention moving all the time.

05:23.577 --> 05:29.419
But this attention that has to be towards
the Divine,

05:29.620 --> 05:37.929
towards the Almighty, is just being
frittered away.

05:38.130 --> 05:44.921
Thus, attention doesn’t grow its own roots.

05:46.595 --> 05:52.083
First is to find out about yourself: where
does your attention go?

05:52.284 --> 06:05.008
What makes you feel like looking after or
concerned for attention?

06:05.209 --> 06:10.012
You see, the attention comes from various
problems,

06:10.213 --> 06:20.580
and could be your upbringing where you are
not controlled,

06:24.807 --> 06:34.799
could be your education, could be your
atmosphere in which you live

06:35.000 --> 06:40.772
or could be your own ego or your
conditioning.

06:42.894 --> 06:47.411
(Hindi: "The water is maybe a bit too cold,
that's why.

06:55.888 --> 07:01.950
What is it, tea? Is it hot?

07:02.965 --> 07:06.969
Pour it here, I'll drink it.

07:16.979 --> 07:19.322
That's fine".)

07:23.188 --> 07:31.229
So, this attention is being attacked

07:31.760 --> 07:43.378
by all these outside energies or negative
forces

07:43.708 --> 07:50.957
and it gets entangled - like a river
flowing

07:51.158 --> 08:00.329
straight into the ocean can get lost
in a barren place.

08:00.530 --> 08:10.233
In the same way this attention, which has
to go towards the Divine,

08:10.434 --> 08:14.532
gets frittered away and is vanished...

08:14.733 --> 08:21.056
This weak attention cannot take you towards
the Divine.

08:21.257 --> 08:27.996
Ultimately you find that all this attention
is being completely

08:28.690 --> 08:35.730
absorbed or frittered away by the nonsense
that’s going on.

08:35.931 --> 08:41.394
Unfortunately or fortunately, you are born
in these modern times,

08:41.595 --> 08:46.746
and in these modern times, as you know,
it's a very chaotic condition.

08:46.947 --> 08:51.947
In these chaotic conditions, you don’t know
what is right and what is wrong.

08:52.148 --> 08:57.525
And there are all kinds of attractions,

08:57.726 --> 09:06.641
which can take away your attention and
reduce the energy of your attention.

09:07.773 --> 09:15.315
It is possible more for the people who are
very right-sided.

09:15.516 --> 09:19.274
Also the left-sided people can be very much
affected.

09:19.475 --> 09:25.082
Right-sided people, as you know, go up to
a point and become extremely dry,

09:25.283 --> 09:32.683
self-opinionated and aggressive. All their
attention is in aggression,

09:32.884 --> 09:38.971
while the people who are on the left side
are indulging too much

09:39.172 --> 09:46.570
into their own whims and their desires and
their own temptations.

09:46.771 --> 09:50.919
Both sides can fritter away your attention

09:51.120 --> 09:57.887
which is the most important thing. It is
the most valuable thing is your attention.

09:58.088 --> 10:02.716
But the attention cannot be controlled by
a person

10:02.917 --> 10:10.628
who doesn't have a weak mind or a weak
heart.

10:10.829 --> 10:15.604
Now supposing you take somebody who is
a very intelligent person.

10:15.805 --> 10:19.845
The intelligent person puts all his
attention

10:20.046 --> 10:24.152
in capturing the attention of others.

10:24.353 --> 10:29.030
I don't know why, but it’s a kind of
a paradox.

10:29.231 --> 10:39.179
The person who himself is having such a lot
of aggressiveness and all that,

10:39.380 --> 10:43.549
tries to be very sweet, tries to be very
nice with people

10:43.750 --> 10:52.284
just to keep good relations or, we can say,
the good behavior

10:52.485 --> 10:57.582
towards people so that they pay attention
to that person.

10:57.783 --> 11:01.732
This is a very subtle thing. They are not
even aware about it,

11:01.933 --> 11:09.870
that we do such a thing just to make others
pay attention to us.

11:10.071 --> 11:13.674
That is how we have seen that in these
modern times

11:13.875 --> 11:19.563
so many stupid things people do just
to attract the attention of others.

11:19.764 --> 11:28.544
Most of the fads that had come up in modern
times

11:28.745 --> 11:36.880
are just to make something stupid so that
people should pay attention to them.

11:38.931 --> 11:44.065
Of course, the Sahaja Yogis are not like
that. But I am just pointing it out

11:44.266 --> 11:47.345
how, in the modern times, you have to be
very careful

11:47.546 --> 11:54.057
that you should not try to attract
the attention of others.

11:54.258 --> 11:59.440
Instead of that, what you have to do is
to pay attention to others

11:59.641 --> 12:03.961
in a very subtle way, not with any
expectation

12:04.162 --> 12:06.108
that if you are paying attention to
somebody,

12:06.309 --> 12:11.508
that person should pay attention to you.
It’s a very big struggle,

12:11.709 --> 12:19.827
I’ve seen, in Sahaja Yoga also, that people
try to, say, become very popular

12:20.028 --> 12:28.090
or become very outstanding, or something
of a very great qualities,

12:28.291 --> 12:32.818
to show off that they are something better
than others.

12:33.019 --> 12:38.495
A person who is really in connection with
the Divine, is least bothered

12:38.696 --> 12:43.681
about how people pay attention to that
person,

12:43.882 --> 12:50.457
but automatically the attention of such
a person is on others,

12:50.658 --> 12:53.872
which is very, very subtle, very subtle.

12:54.073 --> 12:58.105
You cannot make out that the attention
of such a person

12:58.306 --> 13:04.304
is on you, but it works and it works
beautifully.

13:04.505 --> 13:09.906
We have to understand that we have now come
to the realm of the Divinity.

13:10.107 --> 13:15.003
We are in the Kingdom of God and we are
divine people.

13:15.204 --> 13:19.522
We are very powerful people, but if we
fritter away

13:19.723 --> 13:23.482
our attention, we become very, very weak
people.

13:23.683 --> 13:29.479
It's easy to feel that, “we are Sahaja
Yogis”, “we have done

13:29.667 --> 13:35.756
so much of realisation of others” or
“we have helped so many people.”

13:35.957 --> 13:39.816
All this consciousness if it comes within
you, then know

13:40.017 --> 13:44.146
that you are still not fully developed
Sahaja Yogis.

13:44.347 --> 13:50.243
There should be no consciousness of what
you are doing or what you are committing.

13:50.444 --> 13:58.515
There is no need to boast about it. There
is no need to advertise it.

13:58.716 --> 14:03.033
Whatever you are, is already, can be seen
by everyone.

14:03.234 --> 14:06.981
But even that desire is not needed

14:07.182 --> 14:13.196
because you are doing just for
the satisfaction of your Spirit.

14:14.287 --> 14:18.143
So then, when we come to our heart:

14:18.344 --> 14:21.879
in the heart resides the Spirit, as you
know very well.

14:22.080 --> 14:29.791
Now, when it is the heart, which has
to work over your brain and which can work,

14:29.992 --> 14:34.651
what becomes of you is nothing, but you
become a source

14:34.852 --> 14:38.209
of love and compassion. A source, I am
saying.

14:38.410 --> 14:44.079
You do not assert on others. You do not say
that, “I’ve done so much for you

14:44.280 --> 14:53.443
and what are you doing to me? What is this
that I should have so much expressed,

14:53.644 --> 14:56.431
in so many ways, and here you are,

14:56.632 --> 15:01.008
you are forgetting me and not doing
anything for me?”

15:01.209 --> 15:06.714
So the expectation of reward if it is
there,

15:06.915 --> 15:11.166
then you must know is your mind which is
giving you these ideas

15:11.367 --> 15:17.956
and is working it out that way that you
just now put attention

15:18.157 --> 15:21.889
to the amount of love the other person
has given you

15:22.090 --> 15:29.490
for whatever you have given to another
person. It's very subtle.

15:31.939 --> 15:38.654
So in Sahaja Yoga, you should see now
yourself as just a source of love,

15:38.855 --> 15:42.795
which is just flowing.

15:42.996 --> 15:48.350
In that, you do not say that you have
to have this or that,

15:48.551 --> 15:55.941
or you have to achieve this goal, or you
have to become that. It's finished now.

15:56.142 --> 16:03.017
Once you have become the source, then how
can you become something?

16:03.218 --> 16:09.236
The thing is, those who are receiving from
the source want to have

16:09.437 --> 16:21.197
some sort of a reward or some sort of
a recognition.

16:21.398 --> 16:27.608
In this subtle way if you move, your mind
is very clever.

16:27.809 --> 16:32.735
In Sahaja Yoga, we have very clever,
intelligent people.

16:32.936 --> 16:40.561
But this mind... You have to be very
careful because this mind can cheat you.

16:42.477 --> 16:47.174
So ask your mind, "Why are you in Sahaja
Yoga?

16:47.375 --> 16:51.940
What is the purpose of your Sahaja Yoga?"

16:53.265 --> 17:01.544
Gradually this mind will shut up. And then,
you have to ask yourself that,

17:01.745 --> 17:10.069
"What is my own desire now? What do I want?

17:10.270 --> 17:16.873
What do I want to achieve? Why I am
in Sahaja Yoga?"

17:17.619 --> 17:21.798
If you ask this question, you will see
you’ll just dissolve,

17:21.999 --> 17:27.280
you'll become thoughtless because there is
no desire left now.

17:27.481 --> 17:31.168
There is no ambition left, no competition.

17:31.369 --> 17:36.616
All these qualities are of the brain, or we
can say, of the intellect,

17:36.817 --> 17:42.226
which makes you competitive, which makes
you also jealous.

17:42.427 --> 17:46.477
So jealousy is also a product of this
competitiveness

17:46.678 --> 17:51.256
because when two persons are competing
or many are competing

17:51.457 --> 17:55.464
and one is selected, others become jealous.

17:55.665 --> 18:01.467
I mean, instead of feeling happy, "All
right. So, one of us has become something,

18:01.668 --> 18:03.925
so we should be very happy that he has
become."

18:04.126 --> 18:09.536
On the contrary, the other people feel
jealous, "Why has he become?

18:09.737 --> 18:13.933
Who is he? What does he think of himself?"
Then they go further.

18:14.134 --> 18:18.787
Not you people, but on the whole, people
go further with it

18:18.988 --> 18:24.361
and what do they do is to harm another
person.

18:25.313 --> 18:30.510
In Sahaja Yoga, people are also sometimes
very worried and frightened.

18:30.711 --> 18:33.572
There is no need to be worried or
frightened

18:33.773 --> 18:40.911
because now you have become a Sahaja
Yogi and a Guru. Nobody can touch you.

18:41.112 --> 18:47.161
Anybody who tries to touch you will be
subsided, somehow or other.

18:47.362 --> 18:53.442
Of course, I don't do anything as such.
But today only I heard that in Turkey

18:53.643 --> 19:00.103
there were two newspapers who were after
Sahaja Yoga, writing all nonsensical things.

19:00.304 --> 19:07.232
So, the first one met with an accident and
died. I didn't do that.

19:07.433 --> 19:12.658
The second one had two people, editor
and sub-editor,

19:12.859 --> 19:18.565
were killed and somebody cut their throats.
Of course, I didn't do that.

19:18.766 --> 19:21.498
Some fundamentalist must have done, or
somebody must have done.

19:21.699 --> 19:26.772
Now, we don't have to worry as to who
criticizes you, they say it about you

19:26.973 --> 19:29.747
because you must know they are blind
people.

19:29.948 --> 19:35.893
They are absolutely blind, they are not
matured as far as the wisdom is concerned.

19:36.094 --> 19:39.909
For them to understand Sahaja Yoga is not
possible.

19:40.110 --> 19:43.467
They go up to a point and then they stop.
They cannot go further

19:43.668 --> 19:46.707
because this dissolution of your being,

19:46.908 --> 19:53.089
as I said, “the drop becomes the ocean”.

19:53.582 --> 19:58.442
It's difficult, specially in the West,
where there are so many ideas

19:58.643 --> 20:06.617
of their own identifications and of their
own personalities.

20:07.721 --> 20:14.320
Now, it is quite, again, a paradox that we
don’t want people

20:14.521 --> 20:21.380
to dress up indecently or we don’t want
people to behave indecently.

20:21.581 --> 20:26.098
Decency is a very big part of Sahaja Yoga.

20:26.299 --> 20:31.540
So one can ask that, "Mother, when you say
you have to completely dissolve,

20:31.741 --> 20:34.843
then why should we have this dignity?

20:35.044 --> 20:38.461
Why should we worry about having
the dignity?" It's quite all right.

20:38.662 --> 20:41.872
This question is all right. The answer is
like this:

20:42.073 --> 20:54.626
Supposing, you put a drop of some filth in
the ocean, then the ocean can become dirty.

20:54.827 --> 21:00.012
If you put some poison, then the whole
ocean can become poisonous.

21:00.213 --> 21:06.980
In the same way, whatever is not congenial
to the ocean,

21:07.181 --> 21:11.616
to this Divine power, should not be done.

21:11.817 --> 21:18.152
Otherwise, you will spoil the whole of it.
We have had experiences.

21:18.353 --> 21:22.273
We have had Sahaja Yogis who were leaders
also,

21:22.474 --> 21:28.281
and they tried to be quite funny and
the whole collectivity was spoilt.

21:28.482 --> 21:34.656
One person who is not a good person can
spoil the whole collectivity.

21:34.857 --> 21:41.962
The one who is then a leader, on top
of that, is even worse.

21:42.163 --> 21:48.133
So, one has to understand that, when you
are becoming a drop of the ocean,

21:48.334 --> 21:54.006
this ocean is the pure ocean of love.

21:54.207 --> 22:00.126
In that you should not do something that
will create repulsion, frustration,

22:00.327 --> 22:09.740
or even sometimes it can create a very
grotesque image of the whole ocean.

22:09.941 --> 22:14.685
That is why we have to be decent people,
decorous people.

22:14.886 --> 22:22.038
It is not that in any way we want you to be
like a dandy people or anything,

22:22.239 --> 22:27.597
but what it means that you must respect
your body, respect yourself

22:27.798 --> 22:31.969
and a respectable personality you should
have.

22:32.170 --> 22:35.182
Too much indulgence to that is not proper,

22:35.383 --> 22:39.696
but it should be such that you should
respect yourself.

22:39.897 --> 22:43.353
It's very important. If you cannot respect
yourself

22:43.554 --> 22:49.561
you cannot respect at all the Divinity
within you.

22:49.762 --> 22:55.645
It's like a decoration of the Divinity that
your whole behavior,

22:55.846 --> 23:00.683
your whole attire has to be in such a way
that people should know

23:00.884 --> 23:03.689
that he is a decent man.

23:03.890 --> 23:10.509
Indecent things have come out and have
become now an everyday fashion.

23:10.710 --> 23:14.425
And they go on coming one after another
because of the entrepreneurs,

23:14.626 --> 23:16.984
and we are playing into the hands
of entrepreneurs.

23:17.185 --> 23:20.206
But if you know what dress you have to wear

23:20.407 --> 23:24.079
and what is good for you, once for all you
have to decide.

23:24.280 --> 23:27.613
Now the attention should not be also wasted

23:27.814 --> 23:30.963
in that, "I will today, I'll wear this kind
of a sari,

23:31.164 --> 23:34.144
tomorrow I’ll wear that kind of a dress,
third day…",

23:34.345 --> 23:39.513
because that also spoils the attention.
But if it is a decent thing,

23:39.714 --> 23:43.273
it's perfectly alright, and that will
really make you feel

23:43.474 --> 23:46.978
dignified within yourself.

23:47.179 --> 23:49.961
In modern times, as the people are, I don't
think

23:50.162 --> 23:53.581
they have much respect for themselves.

23:54.216 --> 23:57.716
You see very highly posted people, highly
placed people

23:57.917 --> 24:01.870
doing all kinds of nonsensical things like
cheating,

24:02.071 --> 24:12.627
like having relations with people who are
of dishonorable position.

24:12.828 --> 24:15.912
All this is happening. If you see
in the newspaper, you are shocked

24:16.113 --> 24:20.260
how these people at the helm of affairs
could be like this.

24:20.461 --> 24:25.351
Because they are still not matured enough
to know where are they,

24:25.552 --> 24:28.348
what is their position, how they have
to be.

24:28.549 --> 24:32.780
If you are matured enough then you will
understand that, say, I’m a housewife,

24:32.981 --> 24:37.956
I’m such a minister, I’m prime-minister,
how I should be.

24:38.157 --> 24:43.964
That all that achievement they have outside
remains outside, doesn't go inside.

24:44.165 --> 24:47.984
But for a Sahaja Yogi it should be absorbed
within.

24:48.185 --> 24:55.783
It has to be absorbed within so that
the attention is not wasted too much.

24:57.355 --> 25:03.064
The another part which one has to see is
the heart.

25:04.000 --> 25:12.400
Some people are saying, "Mother, if our
heart is ruling the head,

25:12.601 --> 25:17.675
then we become too much emotional, we get
too much attached to people,

25:17.876 --> 25:26.271
we get, you see, sort of individual
friendships and things like that."

25:26.472 --> 25:32.493
On this point, one has to know that why do
you get attached to one person?

25:32.694 --> 25:39.215
It’s not your heart. It’s not your heart.
You get attached to a person

25:39.416 --> 25:47.217
because you have some sort of a, we can
say, a relationship, maybe.

25:47.418 --> 25:51.465
Or maybe, you like the hair-dress of that
person.

25:51.666 --> 25:55.945
Maybe, you like the dress that person has.

25:56.146 --> 26:01.461
Something outside quality is attracting you
towards that person.

26:01.662 --> 26:05.396
It is not something inner quality that is
attracting.

26:05.597 --> 26:11.123
For example, if you are attached to your
children too much, you will spoil them.

26:11.324 --> 26:16.213
They will not come up to your expectations.
Anybody you get attached to,

26:16.414 --> 26:22.864
you must verify, why are you attached
to such a person, what is the reason?

26:23.065 --> 26:28.477
Now, in Sahaja Yoga people are attached
to each other very much, I know that.

26:28.678 --> 26:34.170
But it is not for any external reason.
Because somebody is rich,

26:34.371 --> 26:37.787
because somebody is famous, because
somebody is doing

26:37.971 --> 26:42.913
some sort of a extraordinary work. No.

26:43.114 --> 26:51.709
They are attached to that person because
that person is a bundle of vibrations,

26:51.910 --> 26:56.878
that it gives you tranquillity, it gives
you joy and it gives you

26:57.079 --> 27:04.648
a kind of an immense dissolution of your
being.

27:04.849 --> 27:08.933
So, that happens when you are very much
there,

27:09.134 --> 27:15.051
as I have told you the story of once this
potter

27:15.252 --> 27:24.057
was kneading the clay and his name was
Gorakumhar,

27:24.258 --> 27:27.554
and when Namadeva, who was a tailor,

27:27.755 --> 27:33.829
but very well known poet, both of them
were poets, he went and he saw

27:34.030 --> 27:41.052
this potter was doing such a, I mean, it was
not a very respectable work he was doing,

27:41.253 --> 27:49.024
he was busy kneading the clay, he looked
at him and what he says that,

27:49.225 --> 27:58.056
"I have come here to see the Chaitanya,
to see the formless.

27:58.257 --> 28:05.308
But what I find that the formless has got
into a form."

28:05.509 --> 28:11.787
This only, I always say, is only possible
between the two Saints of the same level.

28:11.988 --> 28:16.340
That the way they appreciate, that the way
they feel -

28:16.541 --> 28:20.709
there are no words for what I want to say -
but the way they feel

28:20.910 --> 28:26.663
the oneness, the unity, which is a subtle
one between each other.

28:26.864 --> 28:33.537
Such a feeling if you have for each other,
then know that you are

28:33.738 --> 28:38.440
really now dissolved and you are in
the ocean of joy.

28:38.641 --> 28:44.343
But on the contrary, those who are sitting
on the shores cannot feel that way.

28:44.544 --> 28:49.385
They judge, they try to find out what’s
wrong with that person, this is not so.

28:49.586 --> 28:54.235
They can never appreciate another person.
What they feel is that they have a right

28:54.436 --> 29:00.372
to criticize, to find out faults with others
and that they are something special.

29:00.573 --> 29:03.666
And the other person also finds some faults
with this person.

29:03.867 --> 29:08.265
So it’s a fault-finding society I find
sometimes. And you get fed up with it.

29:08.466 --> 29:13.945
But when you see that the another person
who is there,

29:14.146 --> 29:23.212
the person who is another saint, you feel
such rapport, such oneness,

29:23.413 --> 29:29.699
such a spontaneous feeling for that person
which is absolutely pure.

29:29.900 --> 29:36.251
There’s no expectation, there’s no mental
activity to find out

29:36.452 --> 29:43.842
what’s wrong with that person. There’s no
judgment about what he, the person is like,

29:44.023 --> 29:54.142
but just oneness with that person you feel,
and you feel that your quality of your love

29:54.343 --> 30:00.006
has got a new shine, a new dimension.

30:00.316 --> 30:04.743
So it comes to that, what we should
appreciate within ourselves

30:04.944 --> 30:11.474
is the purity of our love. When you are
pure, the purity is there,

30:11.675 --> 30:20.188
you do not get attached to anything, but
in that detachment, you are enjoying.

30:20.389 --> 30:26.419
In attachment you cannot enjoy because
in that

30:26.620 --> 30:35.142
you are bothered more about the superficial
relationship with the other person.

30:35.343 --> 30:38.710
Now, in a wider way, if you see Sahaja
Yoga,

30:38.911 --> 30:47.336
you are all very important people -
extremely important -

30:47.677 --> 30:54.341
because in the history of spirituality there
were not so many saints sitting together.

30:54.542 --> 30:58.634
Never can you see so many people from so
many countries

30:58.835 --> 31:04.581
thinking about Divinity and morality.

31:04.851 --> 31:11.284
It is impossible to get so many people
together, on any point whatsoever,

31:11.485 --> 31:17.932
who are feeling the oneness, the...

31:19.630 --> 31:25.908
you can say, the most soothing feeling
with each other.

31:26.109 --> 31:32.320
Whether it is comfortable or not,

31:32.521 --> 31:42.977
whether it is very much according to
the norms of comfort,

31:43.178 --> 31:51.355
people who are saints are absolutely happy
with other saints

31:51.556 --> 31:57.555
and other saintly people. They rush
to people who are saints.

31:57.756 --> 32:01.132
Once it happened to Me when I was
in Kolhapur

32:01.333 --> 32:05.846
that they told Me, “There is a saint who
talks about You.” “So where is he?”

32:06.047 --> 32:09.908
They said, “He lives up there and it will
take at least three hours

32:10.109 --> 32:13.908
for You to climb up. He only lives there,
he doesn't come out.”

32:14.109 --> 32:16.787
I said, "All right, I would like to go and
see him."

32:16.988 --> 32:22.571
So, I was walking and it started raining.

32:22.772 --> 32:25.787
So they said, "Mother, You never go
to anybody like that,

32:25.988 --> 32:32.314
why are You going to him?" I said, "No,
just I want to go up and see him."

32:32.515 --> 32:36.765
Now, this fellow, they said, had a control
over rain,

32:36.966 --> 32:44.257
but it was raining, raining, raining very
heavily, and when I climbed up

32:44.458 --> 32:49.915
I saw him sitting down and going on like
this with great anger.

32:50.116 --> 32:55.358
So, I said, "Let us go and sit in his cave

32:55.559 --> 32:59.207
because this fellow is now not in a normal
mood."

32:59.408 --> 33:06.546
So, I went and sat in the cave there, and
there he came. He couldn't walk

33:06.747 --> 33:12.896
because his... they say that his legs
became absolutely lame

33:13.097 --> 33:17.680
because of the vibrations that were too
much in him,

33:17.881 --> 33:23.592
whatever it is, he couldn't walk. So, they
brought him there, he sat down.

33:23.793 --> 33:29.516
So, the first thing he asked Me, "Why
did You not allow me to stop the rain?

33:29.717 --> 33:35.835
It was raining so heavily, and when You
were coming up,

33:36.036 --> 33:41.181
I didn’t want You to get drenched the way
now You are all full of water

33:41.390 --> 33:48.711
and I didn’t want You to suffer like this
because it’s not a good welcome to You.

33:49.050 --> 33:55.343
So, did You do it just to control my ego,
because I must have developed ego

33:55.543 --> 33:58.254
because I can control rain, that's a fact?"

33:58.455 --> 34:01.860
So I just smiled at him. I said, "See,

34:02.061 --> 34:07.260
you are My son, isn't it? And you have
bought a sari for Me.

34:07.461 --> 34:10.455
But you are a sannyasi, so I can't take
a sari from you

34:10.656 --> 34:12.702
because sannyasi dharma is different -

34:12.903 --> 34:15.840
I'm a Gruhastha, I can't take a sari from
you.

34:16.041 --> 34:20.368
So, I deliberately got drenched so that you
could give Me a sari."

34:20.569 --> 34:26.192
The whole temper, the whole unnatural
behavior, all dropped out.

34:26.393 --> 34:30.764
He became extremely sweet. "Yes, yes,"
he said, "how do You know I bought a sari?"

34:30.965 --> 34:33.745
"At least," I said, "in love you know
everything."

34:33.946 --> 34:39.585
And then he brought a sari for Me and he
did Aarti and everything.

34:39.786 --> 34:47.066
But, you see, all these things show that
how the love masters everything so easily.

34:47.267 --> 34:54.984
Small, small things, if you are expert
in expressing your love,

34:55.185 --> 35:00.668
how it works out. There are so many
incidents I can give you like this.

35:00.869 --> 35:09.399
But the main thing we have to see within
ourselves, "Do we really love each other?

35:09.600 --> 35:17.772
Do we really have affection and compassion
for others who are not even Sahaja Yogis?"

35:17.973 --> 35:23.023
Those who are not Sahaja Yogis are also
the blind people.

35:23.224 --> 35:27.471
You should have compassion for them.

35:27.672 --> 35:32.104
You should feel that these people are so
unhappy

35:32.305 --> 35:35.812
and they cannot come to Sahaja Yoga

35:36.013 --> 35:41.445
and they cannot become Sahaja Yogis,
and only in their ego they are satisfied.

35:41.646 --> 35:45.090
So, you must have real compassion for them.

35:45.291 --> 35:51.074
If you have this compassion you might be
told by people that,

35:51.275 --> 35:55.706
"Why are you wasting your energy, you are
doing this, you are doing that?"

35:55.907 --> 36:01.655
The compassion is actually, unites all
these things within ourselves.

36:01.856 --> 36:06.488
That’s the uniting factor. First is your
attention,

36:06.689 --> 36:11.601
first,  which is very, very important,
I think.

36:11.802 --> 36:17.401
And the second one is your intellect, or
you can say your mind,

36:17.602 --> 36:25.046
and the third one is your heart. They all
get somehow or other united together

36:25.247 --> 36:28.712
once you have this capacity to have
compassion.

36:28.913 --> 36:31.998
You don't quarrel with Me or anyone, you
don't have to think about it.

36:32.199 --> 36:37.214
You just, you just feel absolutely at home
when you are compassionate

36:37.415 --> 36:41.979
and with this compassion, you are having
relations with others.

36:42.180 --> 36:48.663
Now, this compassion is not studied out
or worked out or maneuvered.

36:48.864 --> 36:54.535
It is just there. It is there. In that
compassion it forgives,

36:54.736 --> 36:57.263
it forgets all nonsensical things.

36:57.464 --> 37:04.076
The forgiveness is only possible if you
have this compassion within you.

37:04.277 --> 37:07.483
Now, even there are Sahaja Yogis who asked
me,

37:07.684 --> 37:10.703
"Mother, how can we have love and
compassion?"

37:10.904 --> 37:16.163
I mean, this is a question which many have
asked me.

37:16.364 --> 37:22.726
Now, the simple thing is that if you
develop your thoughtless awareness

37:22.927 --> 37:26.903
in your meditation, in thoughtless
awareness,

37:27.104 --> 37:31.242
you watch anything in thoughtless
awareness, any relationship you see it

37:31.443 --> 37:35.364
in thoughtless awareness, then you’ll be
amazed

37:35.565 --> 37:40.037
how the gates of this compassion will
open out.

37:40.238 --> 37:43.910
Thoughtless awareness opens your heart,

37:44.111 --> 37:48.387
but it doesn't go to one person or
to another person,

37:48.588 --> 37:53.725
but it is throwing lights on all the sides
of your being.

37:53.926 --> 38:03.050
Everybody is benefited, everybody has
a divine feeling for you.

38:03.251 --> 38:12.527
Because this compassion is not linear,
nor is it aggressive, but it just flows

38:12.728 --> 38:16.172
and smoothes and soothes everything

38:16.373 --> 38:22.237
that is chaotic, that is troublesome and
that is painful.

38:22.438 --> 38:24.796
This is what you have now.

38:24.997 --> 38:28.000
You know, these things were done by saints
long time back.

38:28.201 --> 38:31.853
But then nobody liked them, and they
crucified them - out of jealousy.

38:32.054 --> 38:36.724
Because if somebody became a saint, then
people felt very jealous of that person.

38:36.925 --> 38:40.782
So they killed them or tortured them and
troubled them.

38:40.975 --> 38:45.910
The situation is not so bad now. Of course,
there are some useless people.

38:46.111 --> 38:54.217
There are some people who are really
monsters, I agree. Forget about them.

38:54.418 --> 39:01.430
But on the whole, our attitude should be
that these are blind people.

39:01.631 --> 39:06.492
Now, looking at somebody who is, maybe,
something wrong with that person,

39:06.693 --> 39:10.670
may not be good-natured - may be anything.
But in your heart

39:10.871 --> 39:16.684
you should not have any grudge, you should
not have any complaints about them.

39:16.885 --> 39:22.651
You can talk to that person about it. You
can tell him in a way that will be absorbed,

39:22.852 --> 39:28.366
but you should not try to make an issue
out of it

39:28.567 --> 39:31.662
and try to, in any way, trouble or torture
anyone.

39:31.863 --> 39:37.365
("Can you put off this one?" Hindi: "Put
off the fan".)

39:44.271 --> 39:49.053
You have seen already, in Sahaja Yoga,
those people who came and were troublesome

39:49.254 --> 39:54.914
and were not of any worth for us, just
dropped out by themselves.

39:55.115 --> 39:57.575
We didn't have to do much about it. They
just dropped out

39:57.776 --> 40:04.346
and they have gone into some sort of
a problematic life.

40:04.547 --> 40:08.007
I, even now, receive letters from them
saying that, “We have this problem,

40:08.208 --> 40:11.372
we have that problem and how to solve
this and solve that."

40:11.573 --> 40:15.345
But it’s automatically happening because,
after all,

40:15.546 --> 40:21.258
there is a big choice going on and
the Divine s trying to decide

40:21.459 --> 40:26.871
who are capable of receiving the blessings
of the Divine.

40:27.072 --> 40:29.505
This is the only thing you have to achieve.

40:29.706 --> 40:33.286
That’s why you have come to Sahaja Yoga.
Nothing else is important.

40:33.487 --> 40:39.206
There are people who are very highly
placed, tomorrow they go into dust.

40:39.407 --> 40:44.220
There are people who are regarded as very
great, famous people,

40:44.421 --> 40:49.900
they go into dust. It's all the time is
happening in your presence.

40:50.101 --> 40:55.231
Every day you read a newspaper and you
find how they are behaving.

40:55.432 --> 41:00.314
Like today, somebody told Me that in
the newspaper there was there

41:00.515 --> 41:08.183
that now one bishop is going to discotheque,
can you imagine? He is going to a disco.

41:08.384 --> 41:12.569
Now, what people must be thinking, they
must be breaking their heads,

41:12.770 --> 41:17.218
"Now what to do, this stupid fellow whom
we call as the bishop and everything,

41:17.419 --> 41:20.725
is now going to disco."

41:22.194 --> 41:25.792
What they, I mean, all whatever he had
respect,

41:25.993 --> 41:29.910
maybe it is artificial, but it’s all lost,
finished.

41:30.111 --> 41:36.604
Because you see, as they are, they have
no value of themselves.

41:36.805 --> 41:41.605
They just live with their ego, "I am such
a big man. I am this, that. I am a bishop."

41:41.806 --> 41:44.550
They walk in a different way, they talk
in a different way.

41:44.751 --> 41:47.406
And suddenly how they go down.

41:47.607 --> 41:49.686
Now, what was the need for this old Johnny

41:49.887 --> 41:52.994
to go to the discotheque, I can’t
understand?

41:53.195 --> 41:59.749
So, because of this kind of life that he
is leading, thinking no end of himself,

41:59.950 --> 42:04.740
he could never see that, “One day I will
go down like that.”

42:04.941 --> 42:07.791
Another thing, which you should see
in a very wider way,

42:07.992 --> 42:13.003
that he had no feeling why people respected
him.

42:13.204 --> 42:18.132
He never knew why people had respect
for him.

42:18.362 --> 42:25.137
Or he was not conscious of it. At least
he would have preserved that. He did not.

42:25.338 --> 42:31.781
Why should he go to a place about which
he has been always denouncing

42:31.982 --> 42:37.364
and saying that these are bad places, one
should not go there?

42:38.876 --> 42:45.908
So, in your case, you have to be conscious
that you are Sahaja Yogis.

42:46.109 --> 42:49.928
If you become the ocean doesn't mean that
your consciousness has vanished,

42:50.129 --> 42:55.420
but it has enlarged. You have got
the consciousness of the ocean.

42:55.621 --> 43:01.580
You are not the one who has become like
a mesmerized person

43:01.781 --> 43:06.807
or a person who has no connection with
oneself.

43:07.008 --> 43:12.366
On the contrary, you are connected with
yourself much more than you were before.

43:12.567 --> 43:16.408
So, when you become the ocean you don't
loose your personality,

43:16.609 --> 43:20.508
but you expand your personality. You become
a greater person.

43:20.709 --> 43:25.719
And this is happening in Sahaja Yoga. I am
noticing many people are developing

43:25.920 --> 43:31.884
that kind of a personality, and they are
expressing it and manifesting it.

43:32.085 --> 43:34.878
It gives me great joy to see in My lifetime

43:35.079 --> 43:40.770
I could see such people who are doing this
kind of thing.

43:41.151 --> 43:45.976
So, whenever you are doing something,
whatever is your enterprise,

43:46.177 --> 43:50.992
whatever your lifestyle, whatever it is,
that’s all outside.

43:51.193 --> 43:58.496
One should not lose your attention, which
is towards God Almighty.

43:58.697 --> 44:03.016
If that is lost, you are lost. There is
a very nice poem

44:03.217 --> 44:10.529
Namadeva has written about that there
was a boy who was flying a kite.

44:10.730 --> 44:15.137
And the kite was floating, and this boy was
looking after the kite.

44:15.338 --> 44:20.928
And while he was talking to everybody else,
but his attention was on the kite.

44:21.129 --> 44:27.497
Then it goes further. He says that a lady
is having the little child

44:27.698 --> 44:34.201
on her body, on the waist, and she is
cleaning the house.

44:34.402 --> 44:40.338
She is cleaning with a little broom. She
has to move

44:40.539 --> 44:44.216
from here to there and after that cleaning,
she has to do other work also.

44:44.417 --> 44:49.721
But the child is here. So, her attention is
on the child

44:49.922 --> 44:53.282
that he should not fall down, something
should not happen.

44:53.483 --> 44:57.465
Though she is doing all kinds of work,
everything,

44:57.666 --> 45:02.789
her attention is on the child. In the same
way, your attention should be

45:02.990 --> 45:07.163
on your Divine power of Kundalini.

45:09.055 --> 45:12.730
There’s third one he’s described that there
are many ladies

45:12.931 --> 45:16.981
who are taking water from a river.

45:17.182 --> 45:20.735
Sometimes they have three pitchers on their
heads and walking.

45:20.936 --> 45:24.117
And while they are walking, they are
talking to each other,

45:24.318 --> 45:26.906
they are telling stories about each other
and anything,

45:27.107 --> 45:31.900
but their attention was on the pitchers,
which are on their head.

45:32.101 --> 45:35.717
In the same way, whatever we are doing,
our attention

45:35.918 --> 45:39.646
should be on our Kundalini.

45:39.847 --> 45:45.742
We should find out what are we doing.
As it is we have the light.

45:45.943 --> 45:51.877
But you must take light into every corner
of your life,

45:52.078 --> 46:00.920
every aspect of your thinking, every kind
of an effort you make.

46:01.121 --> 46:05.357
And you’ll be amazed, if you really watch
your attention

46:05.558 --> 46:08.687
you will really know what you are doing.

46:08.888 --> 46:11.846
It’s the attention to be watched so much

46:12.047 --> 46:20.723
that ultimately you’ll be surprised that
the attention is no more frittering away.

46:20.924 --> 46:25.332
Without the attention you cannot work out
Sahaja Yoga.

46:25.533 --> 46:32.065
This is the main problem of Sahaja Yoga,
is that your attention has to be

46:32.266 --> 46:37.338
towards God Almighty. Otherwise, nothing
can work out.

46:37.539 --> 46:40.872
Your ascent cannot work out. Hah, if you
have come to Sahaja Yoga

46:41.073 --> 46:43.889
to make money, all right, you will make
money and get out.

46:44.090 --> 46:47.241
If you have come here to show off your
knowledge and all that,

46:47.442 --> 46:51.444
you will show it and get out. If you have
come here to show

46:51.645 --> 46:57.612
your power and your authority, you stay
there and get out.

46:57.813 --> 47:00.427
Like that many people have gone out if you
know.

47:00.628 --> 47:07.310
And this is what is to be really taken
care of: that you don’t try

47:07.511 --> 47:11.368
to use Sahaja Yoga for all these stupid
things,

47:11.569 --> 47:18.823
which are not permanent, which are not
eternal. Sahaja Yoga is to be used just

47:19.024 --> 47:27.358
for cleansing yourself, for becoming
the ocean, the ocean of love.

47:27.559 --> 47:34.782
Now, many people also feel that love is
rather difficult,

47:34.983 --> 47:42.206
because you can be harmed by others, or
somebody can take advantage of you.

47:42.407 --> 47:49.917
The main thing about love is, if it is not
a pure love, then it creates problems.

47:50.118 --> 47:52.817
Supposing you trust somebody because
of money,

47:53.018 --> 47:55.387
trust somebody because of somebody…
relationship

47:55.588 --> 47:58.268
or anything, and you go on indulging
into it,

47:58.469 --> 48:04.864
ultimately you’ll find that you will be
very disappointed. Very disappointed.

48:05.065 --> 48:13.468
But supposing you show your love, just
with purity about that person...

48:13.669 --> 48:23.568
It’s so subtle. It’s so innate within you,
built in. It’s there.

48:23.769 --> 48:30.932
We have to just open out. Every human being
is a bundle of love.

48:31.217 --> 48:34.740
And when he is afraid of others - specially
in the West,

48:34.941 --> 48:36.917
there is so many ideas they have created

48:37.118 --> 48:42.339
that you are afraid of this kind of love
and that kind of love and

48:42.540 --> 48:46.221
you see the way the perversion and
all nonsense is there.

48:46.422 --> 48:53.472
But in pure love there is a kind of
a beautiful light

48:53.673 --> 49:01.116
which protects you, which guides you and
which enlightens your life completely.

49:01.317 --> 49:12.744
This light is just nourished and also, we
can say, like the lamp has to have the oil,

49:12.945 --> 49:20.141
this is the one that is for our
spirituality: the Love of a person.

49:20.342 --> 49:25.055
You are embodiment of love, take it from
Me, because you are a human being.

49:25.256 --> 49:29.142
Even the animals are there who know what
is love is.

49:29.343 --> 49:36.451
You see… I know that if you love a tiger,
the tiger will never harm.

49:36.652 --> 49:39.327
If you love a snake, it will never harm.

49:39.528 --> 49:45.803
If you try to love anybody who is very
cruel and very bad,

49:46.004 --> 49:51.963
gradually he will calm down. He will harm
you little bit, he will do this,

49:52.164 --> 49:56.824
he will see things and he might be mean
with you, do all kinds of things.

49:57.025 --> 50:01.164
But then, gradually you find your love
works, and works, and works.

50:01.365 --> 50:06.983
And ultimately it is your love, which is
important to that person.

50:07.302 --> 50:13.130
Now, your love is really firstly
appreciated

50:13.331 --> 50:18.991
more by innocent people, like children.
Children know what love is.

50:19.192 --> 50:26.285
If the children see you, and they run away,
that means something wrong with you.

50:26.486 --> 50:30.967
I’ve seen people… like once we were
in Japan

50:31.168 --> 50:35.515
and there were two foreigners who were
there, ladies, who were dressed up -

50:35.710 --> 50:38.484
I don't know from which hair-dresser they
had dressed up themselves

50:38.685 --> 50:45.297
and they were very much overly decorated -
and they came with us, you see.

50:45.498 --> 50:53.561
We climbed up a place to see something
and when we came down

50:53.762 --> 50:59.280
there were some children standing there.
They had gone before us. So they said,

50:59.481 --> 51:03.777
"Where are those witches?” I said, “Which?”
“Which went with you?"

51:03.978 --> 51:07.214
I said, "What do you mean?" "They came,
you know, we were frightened,

51:07.415 --> 51:11.456
we ran away to our houses. Now we have
come to tell you they are witches."

51:11.657 --> 51:14.252
These small, small little Japanese
children, you know,

51:14.453 --> 51:17.086
"They are witches, you know, they are
witches. Be afraid of them."

51:17.287 --> 51:21.582
And they had decorated themselves so much,
so much hair-dressed up.

51:21.783 --> 51:25.541
They have tried to make such a beautiful
show of themselves,

51:25.742 --> 51:29.495
but the… for the children, they were
witches and they ran away.

51:29.696 --> 51:32.832
And when we came, they came running and
telling us, “Don't be with them,

51:33.033 --> 51:35.574
they're witches.”

51:35.775 --> 51:40.602
So, the judgment of the innocent people
is the best judgment.

51:40.803 --> 51:45.065
If they are innocent, they are extremely
well equipped

51:45.266 --> 51:49.108
to judge a person - who has love and who
does not have.

51:49.309 --> 51:53.793
And they are the best people because they
will appreciate you the best.

51:53.994 --> 51:58.163
They will understand that these are people
of some high quality.

51:58.364 --> 52:05.311
But if they are not innocent, cunning,
some people are extremely cunning -

52:05.512 --> 52:09.205
that’s the intelligence part of it - they
can never appreciate you.

52:09.406 --> 52:16.675
They'll appreciate something which is,
something very, very abnormal,

52:16.876 --> 52:23.035
which from divine part, divine angle,

52:23.236 --> 52:32.400
is very, very abtuse and funny. But they
will never appreciate you.

52:32.601 --> 52:35.599
Never, cannot. Up to a point they may,
but may not.

52:35.800 --> 52:40.287
Doesn't matter. You have to appreciate
yourself.

52:40.488 --> 52:46.562
You have to know that you are not unkind
to anyone, you are not judging others,

52:46.763 --> 52:53.225
and that you are appreciating everything
in that person -

52:53.426 --> 52:58.587
whatever is good in him as a human being.
It works.

52:58.788 --> 53:03.283
You have seen, this all has worked through
My love and compassion.

53:03.484 --> 53:08.589
But I’m not conscious that I’m giving you
love or compassion or anything.

53:08.790 --> 53:11.669
I’m not conscious even that I am giving you
anything.

53:11.870 --> 53:19.671
I’m not even conscious as to… I have
created such a lot of beautiful people.

53:19.872 --> 53:22.898
I am not conscious of that. It’s just
happening.

53:23.099 --> 53:26.462
Just like this tree is here, see, it is
not conscious

53:26.663 --> 53:32.485
as to what it is and what it looks like.
It’s just is there.

53:32.686 --> 53:38.276
In the same way, if it happens to you,
I tell you, you become really

53:38.477 --> 53:43.758
the source of such a joy for everyone.

53:43.959 --> 53:49.678
Now, what do we have to do for this world?
What is needed to be done for this world?

53:49.879 --> 53:53.463
People talk of peace, this, that. There’s
no need to do anything.

53:53.664 --> 53:58.238
It just… you become a personality of that
kind -

53:58.439 --> 54:04.235
you emit peace, you emit love, you emit joy
to others.

54:04.436 --> 54:08.354
Now, this power is within you because it is
built-in, it's within you.

54:08.555 --> 54:14.386
It is in a potential form in every person.
Only thing, it has to be brought out.

54:14.587 --> 54:27.454
Now, with affection, you may not, but with
love and feeling that is innate within you.

54:27.655 --> 54:32.414
Because there are no words for such subtle
things that are within yourself.

54:32.615 --> 54:35.718
Because so far people don’t know what are
these things

54:35.919 --> 54:39.870
that make you feel oneness with others.

54:40.071 --> 54:47.864
All this, all this can happen to you very
easily, very easily,

54:48.065 --> 54:54.952
when you understand that you are not this
mind, you are not this body,

54:55.153 --> 55:00.882
you are not this attention - you are
the Spirit.

55:03.060 --> 55:06.781
Then you introspect, "Am I the Spirit?
All right, if I am the Spirit,

55:06.982 --> 55:10.439
what is… what am I doing?"

55:12.467 --> 55:16.849
Once you become the Spirit, then you feel,
"Why not others?"

55:17.050 --> 55:21.356
Out of love and compassion. Not for
becoming some leaders or anything.

55:21.557 --> 55:25.781
Just out of love. "If I am that why not
make others like that?"

55:25.982 --> 55:28.849
And that is how Sahaja Yoga has spread
so much,

55:29.050 --> 55:33.144
and we have such gems of people, such
beautiful people

55:33.345 --> 55:39.039
that I really never expected so much
to happen in My lifetime.

55:39.240 --> 55:44.413
It has never happened with any saint, any
incarnation, any prophet.

55:44.614 --> 55:49.039
So now, you people have become absolutely

55:49.240 --> 55:53.947
‘Khalis’ means absolutely you have vacated
yourself fully.

55:54.148 --> 55:57.699
The story of Radha and Krishna is very
beautiful

55:57.900 --> 56:04.567
where Radha said that, "Why do You take
this...

56:10.080 --> 56:12.227
[Hindi: "I don’t know the English word
for Murli’"],

56:12.428 --> 56:15.972
flute... to Your throat? Why do You take
this?"

56:16.173 --> 56:19.870
Because Murli is such a sweet thing, ‘na’,
flute is not so sweet.

56:20.071 --> 56:24.340
"But why do You take this flute to Your
lips?"

56:24.541 --> 56:29.499
After all… She, She must have been jealous,
I think so.

56:30.185 --> 56:36.502
So, it's a story, just a story. So, He
said, "Why not go and ask the flute?"

56:36.703 --> 56:40.144
So, flute She went and asked, "Why
Shri Krishna

56:40.345 --> 56:43.921
takes you to His lips all the time?"

56:44.122 --> 56:47.923
So, he said, she said, "You know,

56:48.124 --> 56:53.217
I have become completely hollow. There’s
nothing in me.

56:53.418 --> 57:00.684
He puts me to His lips and people say
that I am playing the tune.

57:00.885 --> 57:06.710
It’s He who is playing the tune. Where
am I? I’m not there.

57:06.911 --> 57:11.992
I’m just enjoying the same tune, which is
passing through me.

57:13.360 --> 57:18.558
That is the expression." But then Radha
told Shri Krishna,

57:18.759 --> 57:22.776
"Why don't You make (me) the same way
as the flute?"

57:22.977 --> 57:28.347
So, this is what you have to be, the flute,
means you have to be hollow within yourself.

57:28.548 --> 57:35.439
All these little, little things, you know,
which come into your life are not important.

57:35.640 --> 57:41.450
What is important is - have you become
completely hollow?

57:41.651 --> 57:45.436
This is where, I would say, introspection
will help.

57:45.637 --> 57:50.682
The one who makes the flute is also within
you.

57:50.883 --> 57:58.234
So let there be a flute made out of you
by yourself only.

57:58.435 --> 58:04.879
This is the way you make yourself what you
have to become.

58:05.080 --> 58:09.850
In Gita Shri Krishna has said, "Atmaneva
Atmane Shrushta",

58:10.051 --> 58:13.673
means the Spirit gets satisfied by itself.

58:13.874 --> 58:17.517
Isn't it very difficult thing to
understand -

58:17.718 --> 58:21.215
how can the Spirit be satisfied by itself?

58:21.416 --> 58:24.389
But now you can understand what
Shri Krishna has said

58:24.590 --> 58:30.463
that your own Spirit becomes satisfied with
itself.

58:30.664 --> 58:33.812
Then it doesn't require any other
satisfaction.

58:34.013 --> 58:38.116
You seek the comfort of your Spirit, you
seek the joy of your Spirit,

58:38.317 --> 58:41.444
you seek the beauty of your Spirit.

58:41.645 --> 58:51.334
You don't even seek, but it is in itself
is filled with that joy of the Spirit

58:51.535 --> 58:56.817
and it only can be satisfied by itself.

58:57.018 --> 58:59.983
There are many people who say, "I am not
satisfied, you see,

59:00.183 --> 59:05.303
this I am not very much satisfied, it is
not that I am satisfied."

59:05.727 --> 59:11.699
In the same way, the Spirit can say,
"I am not satisfied."

59:11.900 --> 59:17.823
But the Spirit can be satisfied with Spirit
only.

59:18.270 --> 59:23.343
It’s like the reflection in the mirror.
When you look at the mirror you see there

59:23.640 --> 59:28.737
your own reflection. Now, if the mirror is
not all right, I will say,

59:28.938 --> 59:32.663
"I am not satisfied with what reflection
we are getting out of this mirror."

59:32.864 --> 59:35.462
So you’ll change the mirror, you’ll bring
the better mirror,

59:35.663 --> 59:40.497
you'll try to get a better picture
of yourself. In the same way,

59:40.698 --> 59:47.378
the Spirit which is reflected within you,
wants to see its own image.

59:47.579 --> 59:53.051
And then what you do is to… you go on,
somehow or other,

59:53.252 --> 01:00:00.648
changing, cleaning, making it all right
through your meditation

01:00:00.849 --> 01:00:05.486
so that your Spirit is satisfied with
the Spirit.

01:00:05.687 --> 01:00:09.695
Shri Krishna wrote Gita in such a ambiguous
manner because He was very clever.

01:00:09.896 --> 01:00:12.042
He knew human beings cannot take things
straight,

01:00:12.243 --> 01:00:14.223
so tell them this way, that way, that way,

01:00:14.424 --> 01:00:18.799
so that they’ll run around and then
ultimately they will come to Truth.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:23.913
But Truth is very simple. Truth is
extremely simple.

01:00:24.114 --> 01:00:27.659
You don't have to go here and there and
you don't have to stand on your legs

01:00:27.860 --> 01:00:33.174
or feet all the time. You don't have
to fight with anything.

01:00:33.375 --> 01:00:40.108
You don't have to take to some sort of
a ‘tapasya’, abstinence - nothing.

01:00:40.309 --> 01:00:49.030
Only just you become like a flute. You
become hollow.

01:00:49.231 --> 01:00:53.311
It’s not difficult. It’s not difficult
at all for Sahaja Yogis

01:00:53.512 --> 01:00:57.894
because already the Kundalini has made
you hollow. It’s not difficult.

01:00:58.095 --> 01:01:04.794
But still, I find people deviate. Their
attention goes here and there.

01:01:04.995 --> 01:01:07.984
So many people have told Me how their
problems were solved

01:01:08.185 --> 01:01:12.040
without doing anything about it. I said,
"What did you do?"

01:01:12.241 --> 01:01:17.255
"No, Mother, we just put it at Your lotus
feet." I said, "Really?"

01:01:17.456 --> 01:01:21.886
"Yes, that's all. Or we were just looking
at the problem, what the problem is.

01:01:22.087 --> 01:01:27.032
We were standing outside and looking
at the problem and the problem got solved."

01:01:27.233 --> 01:01:30.838
Even the most difficult problems that you
think, can be solved

01:01:31.039 --> 01:01:38.655
very easily because you have powers. Your
powers are great.

01:01:38.856 --> 01:01:43.787
You are saints, but more than saints,

01:01:44.234 --> 01:01:50.370
much more than saints because you are born
at such a volatile times.

01:01:50.571 --> 01:01:56.336
Like supposing, you have a light in
darkness, you are finding something,

01:01:56.537 --> 01:02:00.300
you bump into that and you bump into that.

01:02:00.501 --> 01:02:06.348
But supposing, this is a place full of gas,

01:02:06.729 --> 01:02:14.184
you bring one light, the whole thing becomes
enlightened. Like that you have powers.

01:02:14.385 --> 01:02:22.956
But you must get out of this nonsense
of "me", "my" and "mine".

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:28.136
I don't know how to say you get out -
It’s not like a swimming pool,

01:02:28.337 --> 01:02:31.870
that you jump into it and get out. It’s not
like that.

01:02:32.071 --> 01:02:40.503
It is another kind of a very subtle
understanding that our roots have to grow.

01:02:40.704 --> 01:02:44.261
And for growing our roots, we have to go
within ourselves

01:02:44.462 --> 01:02:52.706
and find out within ourselves what is
the area we are occupying,

01:02:52.907 --> 01:03:00.544
in what areas in our lifestyle we are
taking these roots inside.

01:03:00.745 --> 01:03:07.147
Also, Shri Krishna has said that the tree
of life has the roots in the brain

01:03:07.348 --> 01:03:10.883
and grows downward. It’s very interesting
to understand

01:03:11.084 --> 01:03:14.566
that the roots are growing in the brain.

01:03:14.767 --> 01:03:22.894
That means, your own intellect is just
covered with compassion,

01:03:23.095 --> 01:03:34.352
it’s just being absolutely one with
compassion.

01:03:34.963 --> 01:03:37.490
I had told you a story about a saint

01:03:37.691 --> 01:03:42.178
who was to take to… water for the Deity
n Gujarat

01:03:42.379 --> 01:03:49.435
and he walked one month to go there with
a pitcher of water.

01:03:49.636 --> 01:03:57.523
And then at the… because it was a very
high mountain on which this Deity was,

01:03:57.724 --> 01:04:03.243
and he reached at the foothill.

01:04:03.444 --> 01:04:08.582
There he found a little donkey dying
of thirst

01:04:08.783 --> 01:04:13.262
so he poured all the water for that donkey.

01:04:13.463 --> 01:04:16.032
So those who were with him, they asked,
"What are you doing?

01:04:16.233 --> 01:04:19.949
You brought it all the way, and why are
you putting it for this donkey?"

01:04:20.150 --> 01:04:21.118
He said, "You don't know?

01:04:21.319 --> 01:04:25.228
The God has come all the way down, just
to meet me here.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.524
He doesn't want me to climb up."

01:04:27.725 --> 01:04:35.961
This kind of an absolutely simple
understanding

01:04:36.162 --> 01:04:43.928
of another's feelings and another's
problems:

01:04:44.129 --> 01:04:48.395
you can solve them, you can sort them out.

01:04:48.596 --> 01:04:51.517
And the person will tell you that, "You
sorted out my problem."

01:04:51.718 --> 01:04:57.586
But you will not know how you have solved
because this love is the power.

01:04:57.787 --> 01:05:01.468
This love can see things. It is everything.

01:05:01.669 --> 01:05:05.514
It’s like a… you see a television,
all right, it’s a television.

01:05:05.715 --> 01:05:08.138
If you see a telephone, it's a telephone.

01:05:08.339 --> 01:05:16.826
If you see anything you do with the power,
it’s all is embodied inside this love.

01:05:17.027 --> 01:05:21.616
You need not have to telephone. I never
telephone to anyone.

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:25.287
Mostly I never telephone. I mean, if
somebody forces Me then it’s all right.

01:05:25.488 --> 01:05:28.634
I never telephone. But not to save
the bill,

01:05:28.835 --> 01:05:33.195
but I do not telephone because there is
no need.

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:37.508
The whole subtle of the ether is at your
feet.

01:05:37.709 --> 01:05:44.159
Just you want to do something you can just
do it, just with the vibrations.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:49.377
Now, many people say, "Mother, cure this
person, cure that person." There’s no need.

01:05:49.578 --> 01:05:55.289
You all can cure, you are so many. You can
cure anyone you want to,

01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:58.805
but you bring that person to Me. It’s not
needed.

01:05:59.006 --> 01:06:01.725
Just you can cure anybody you feel like.

01:06:01.926 --> 01:06:08.134
You can solve all their problems yourself.
One little Bandhan can solve it.

01:06:08.335 --> 01:06:11.902
But for that you should be the source
of love.

01:06:12.103 --> 01:06:20.731
Once you give a Bandhan, the… this powerful
love takes over,

01:06:20.932 --> 01:06:24.375
"All right, I'll do the job."

01:06:25.608 --> 01:06:30.169
But for that you have to be the master
of this beautiful thing.

01:06:30.370 --> 01:06:35.227
Now, one thing is very different from other
masteries.

01:06:35.428 --> 01:06:38.983
In other masteries, you see people try
to dominate

01:06:39.184 --> 01:06:44.403
or to, try to use it for destroying others.

01:06:44.604 --> 01:06:53.418
But the mastery of love is that you know
how to build

01:06:54.388 --> 01:07:02.949
a rapport with the Divine love. And this
Divine love is not only powerful,

01:07:03.150 --> 01:07:14.413
but it is such a efficient, I should say,
such an alert instrument

01:07:14.614 --> 01:07:17.710
which works out everything in such a manner

01:07:17.911 --> 01:07:22.674
that you are amazed how things have worked
out.

01:07:22.875 --> 01:07:26.529
And everybody has noticed it. I know you
all know it.

01:07:26.730 --> 01:07:29.227
Not that you don't know, but you don't use.

01:07:29.428 --> 01:07:33.987
You have to be on the vibratory awareness
and use that.

01:07:34.188 --> 01:07:38.102
Even giving yourself is a Bandhan itself
clarifies you.

01:07:38.303 --> 01:07:45.438
Imagine in your hand there is this great
power of giving you this balance,

01:07:45.639 --> 01:07:49.844
this love, this affection and all
the protection

01:07:50.045 --> 01:07:54.534
while you can give it to others also. You
have become now

01:07:54.735 --> 01:07:59.874
the part and parcel of the Divine power.
You are now in the Kingdom of God.

01:08:00.075 --> 01:08:04.752
And whatever you want to do can be done
by this divine power.

01:08:04.953 --> 01:08:09.987
With all this telling you I still feel,
sometimes, you are not confident.

01:08:10.188 --> 01:08:16.444
You get upset. You feel that, "How can
this be?"

01:08:16.645 --> 01:08:20.305
You have no trust in yourself, you have no
faith in yourself.

01:08:20.506 --> 01:08:27.672
And also there are some people, sort of,
who feel they are neglected,

01:08:27.873 --> 01:08:31.735
or something should have happened to them.

01:08:31.936 --> 01:08:37.098
Once a lady started crying. So, I said,
"Why is she crying?"

01:08:37.299 --> 01:08:42.303
She said, "Because Mother didn't smile
at me." I didn’t smile at her?

01:08:42.504 --> 01:08:47.928
But I never smiled at anyone. I don't know
why she thinks like that.

01:08:48.129 --> 01:08:54.417
So, I asked her, "Why do you want Me
to smile at you? What's wrong with you?

01:08:54.618 --> 01:08:57.705
You are all right? Why should I smile
at you?"

01:08:57.906 --> 01:09:00.707
So, you see, also this kind of a feeling

01:09:00.908 --> 01:09:04.055
that comes up sometimes that in Sahaja
Yoga,

01:09:04.256 --> 01:09:09.232
Mother should all the time be only attached
to you.

01:09:09.433 --> 01:09:13.989
She cannot get attached, you know.
It’s a helpless condition I have.

01:09:14.190 --> 01:09:18.802
There are so many, you don't know, defects
I have, which you have no idea.

01:09:19.003 --> 01:09:20.878
I don't know how to count money.

01:09:21.079 --> 01:09:24.248
If I… give Me hundred rupees I’ll count it
two hundred rupees.

01:09:24.449 --> 01:09:26.794
You see, I don't know many things. I don't
know banking;

01:09:26.995 --> 01:09:30.616
I don't know many things and one of them
is I don't know

01:09:30.817 --> 01:09:36.764
how to put attention to this person or
to that person. Like politicians would do -

01:09:36.965 --> 01:09:41.609
"You see, ah, you must look after this man,
because he is very important." Nothing.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:47.390
To Me you are just part and parcel of Me,
finished, nothing more than that.

01:09:47.591 --> 01:09:53.432
So, you see, everybody so should know that
you are very close to My heart,

01:09:53.633 --> 01:09:58.294
you are very much there, I am very proud
of you. And something,

01:09:58.495 --> 01:10:04.268
really it’s a miracle that has happened,
that you people have taken to Sahaja Yoga.

01:10:04.469 --> 01:10:09.367
So on that point also, that how much Mother
cares for me, what She does...

01:10:09.568 --> 01:10:12.165
Now supposing, I tell somebody, "All right,
you don't sit here, sit there,"

01:10:12.366 --> 01:10:15.847
they feel bad. Anything you do, they feel
bad.

01:10:16.048 --> 01:10:21.735
This kind of a person has no sense of love.
He doesn't understand Mother's love.

01:10:21.936 --> 01:10:24.715
So, at the end of the whole thing I must
tell you,

01:10:24.916 --> 01:10:29.499
that when you are a guru, you are also
a mother.

01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:35.670
You have to express yourself like a mother.
She is kind, she is gentle, she forgives.

01:10:35.871 --> 01:10:40.313
She also corrects whenever it’s necessary,
but in her own sweet way she corrects

01:10:40.514 --> 01:10:45.062
so the correction takes place - it's not
that a rebellion starts.

01:10:45.263 --> 01:10:51.843
So all that wisdom of a mother is within
you, is already there, so please try to use.

01:10:52.028 --> 01:10:58.072
I am sure, it will all work out and as it
is we are a very beautiful group of people

01:10:58.273 --> 01:11:09.403
who are something out of the blue, who are
so much in peace and in joy together.

01:11:09.604 --> 01:11:12.871
May God bless you all.

01:11:22.369 --> 01:11:26.755
So, today's Guru Puja will be... Of course,
we can -

01:11:26.956 --> 01:11:30.569
we can have a little of Ganesha's Atharva
Sheersha,

01:11:30.770 --> 01:11:34.008
but Devi Puja will be much less.

01:11:34.209 --> 01:11:40.211
And for Guru Puja I would request
the country leaders to come up.

01:11:40.412 --> 01:11:45.122
Country leaders have to come up. So it is
in a different way,

01:11:45.323 --> 01:11:49.218
we can say that the main thing is
the Guru Puja

01:11:49.419 --> 01:11:51.878
where the country leaders have to come up.

01:11:52.079 --> 01:11:58.148
The Devi Puja will be followed after that,
which is very short.

01:11:59.303 --> 01:12:03.106
(Hindi: "Please, change this tea.")
