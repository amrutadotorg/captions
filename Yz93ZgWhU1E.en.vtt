00:03.126 --> 00:05.282
Welcome to "All the beauty that exists".

00:05.483 --> 00:11.040
A meditation that allows you to reach
a joyful state of thoughtless awareness;

00:11.240 --> 00:14.204
that's what Sahaja Yoga is, a technique

00:14.405 --> 00:16.776
developed by an Indian princess,
Shri Mataji,

00:16.977 --> 00:20.564
who travelled tirelessly for 40 years
to teach it

00:20.766 --> 00:25.354
free of charge to people of all ages,
holding thousands of conferences.

00:25.555 --> 00:29.797
Today there are many youngsters who
are taking to this kind of discipline

00:29.998 --> 00:32.657
that gives great serenity.

00:32.858 --> 00:36.243
Let go of your thoughts,

00:36.587 --> 00:40.961
of everything we did today,

00:41.352 --> 00:44.641
and everything we still have to do.

00:45.279 --> 00:52.671
Let's start getting into contact
with our inner energy

00:52.872 --> 01:01.746
which like a mother guides us,
corrects us, supports us.

01:01.947 --> 01:05.796
Evening in the district of San Lorenzo,
Rome: a group of people,

01:05.997 --> 01:09.801
especially young people, meet weekly
to do meditation.

01:10.002 --> 01:13.457
Some of them have been doing it every day
since they were born,

01:13.658 --> 01:17.370
but it is an open group with many
new people of all ages,

01:17.571 --> 01:22.503
that are drawn by the novelty
and many remain.

01:24.843 --> 01:28.963
Remember that this movement is not
to be done mechanically

01:29.172 --> 01:31.433
but it has a very deep meaning.

01:31.689 --> 01:36.031
We are raising our Kundalini's
and our attention along with it.

01:36.232 --> 01:41.291
And then we give ourselves seven bandhans,
which are the seven protective arcs.

01:42.606 --> 01:47.138
Kundalini, the most subtle spiritual energy
resides at the base of the spine,

01:47.339 --> 01:52.109
in the sacrum bone and is in a dormant
state in most human beings.

01:52.310 --> 01:56.375
The awakening of the Kundalini has always
been the goal of all the schools of Yoga

01:56.576 --> 02:00.844
and of many spiritual traditions because
it means Self Realization,

02:01.045 --> 02:04.367
the attainment of peace of serenity,
of joy,

02:04.568 --> 02:09.417
of a state of thoughtless awareness.
It is a practice known in India

02:09.618 --> 02:11.817
and throughout the Eastern world
for thousands of years,

02:12.018 --> 02:13.844
but as the prerogative of few.

02:14.045 --> 02:19.437
Sahaja Yoga is a simple method for
giving Self Realization to the masses.

02:19.638 --> 02:23.359
Shri Mataji dedicated her whole life
to create it,

02:23.560 --> 02:26.172
to unveil to mankind the existence
of an inner power

02:26.373 --> 02:28.969
capable of bringing about the evolution
of human beings.

02:29.170 --> 02:34.224
Public program, Rome
1987

02:50.066 --> 02:51.899
Nirmala was born in India,
in an enlightened family,

02:52.100 --> 02:54.679
and as a child met Gandhi and stayed
in his ashram.

02:54.880 --> 02:57.250
In her youth she studied medicine
in Lahore

02:57.419 --> 02:59.953
and became a leader of nationalism
following her father’s footsteps.

03:00.154 --> 03:03.649
She travelled the world as a diplomat's
wife, and from 1970 onwards,

03:03.850 --> 03:06.843
once her daughters had grown up,
she continued to travel tirelessly,

03:07.044 --> 03:09.844
bringing her message to millions
of people.

03:12.661 --> 03:17.343
The time has come to know the divinity
that is within you.

03:18.614 --> 03:25.047
Be joyful about yourselves and make
others enjoy with you.

03:25.248 --> 03:28.763
There is an energy, a power within us
that once awakened,

03:28.980 --> 03:31.850
gives us knowledge of ourselves
and of our Self.

03:32.051 --> 03:35.576
Shri Mataji taught how to awaken
this energy and today

03:35.777 --> 03:39.123
thousands of volunteers spread around
the world, continue to teach it,

03:39.324 --> 03:45.600
explaining it alongside the practice to
satisfy the rational mind of us Westerners.

03:45.801 --> 03:48.092
We have put the hand on the heart

03:48.293 --> 03:53.857
because any journey begins with a desire
that must be expressed.

03:54.058 --> 03:58.163
We have expressed a very important wish
here that is

03:58.364 --> 04:02.578
to understand who we are, saying:
"Mother Kundalini, Mother Energy,

04:02.779 --> 04:06.180
who are we really? ". This is
the fundamental question.

04:06.363 --> 04:08.511
The left hand then moves to the side,

04:08.712 --> 04:11.725
to the neck, to the forehead and finally
to the head.

04:11.926 --> 04:17.480
We bring our hand to our neck,
on the left-hand side.

04:20.456 --> 04:25.084
This is where all our guilty feelings
reside.

04:26.176 --> 04:29.311
But we are the Spirit.

04:29.668 --> 04:34.444
"Mother Kundalini, I am not guilty
at all".

04:34.645 --> 04:38.709
This sense of guilt actually only serves
to avoid facing the problems,

04:38.910 --> 04:44.647
to hide ourselves and, even worse,
when we give them too much attention,

04:44.848 --> 04:48.178
it takes us in a negative spiral
of self-pity,

04:48.379 --> 04:50.085
we start comparing ourselves
with others

04:50.286 --> 04:51.928
and we tell ourselves that we are
worth nothing.

04:52.128 --> 04:55.162
We feel guilty about something because
we have not actually dealt with it.

04:55.363 --> 04:59.904
If instead we find the strength
to surrender this sense of guilt,

05:00.105 --> 05:03.569
we get back in the saddle, start moving
again and gallop ahead!

05:04.895 --> 05:07.319
The Kundalini passes through
six chakras

05:07.520 --> 05:09.967
and comes out of the fontanelle,
situated at the top of our heads,

05:10.168 --> 05:12.795
where it unites with the all-pervading
energy,

05:12.996 --> 05:16.413
bringing us to the state of Yoga,
which means 'Union'.

05:16.614 --> 05:21.397
Let's try and see if something is coming
out from our head.

05:21.621 --> 05:25.909
A cool breeze or heat.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.378
The maternal energy or Kundalini
in its ascent nourishes and purifies

05:30.579 --> 05:34.202
the subtle body, bringing it back
into a properly functioning state

05:34.403 --> 05:38.045
with benefits felt on the physical
and emotional levels.

05:38.246 --> 05:41.717
Day after day, sometimes
with difficulty

05:41.918 --> 05:44.236
I managed to undertake this path

05:44.437 --> 05:51.069
which has made a lot of
so-called paranoia,

05:51.270 --> 05:54.706
that was really suffocating my life

05:54.906 --> 05:57.815
and was leading me into many
unpleasant situations, go away.

05:57.977 --> 06:03.081
Slowly but surely, with constancy
of course, I can now say that

06:03.282 --> 06:07.893
I live a large percentage of my days
with serenity, in peace.

06:08.094 --> 06:11.667
Sometimes, if we are not alright,
we don’t understand each other.

06:11.844 --> 06:16.553
I met so many people that helped me grow
and who always give me

06:16.754 --> 06:20.659
a place where I can come back to
and be myself.

06:20.860 --> 06:24.729
I rediscovered the joy of the collectivity
and I managed to change myself.

06:24.930 --> 06:27.425
I was an extremely shy and introverted
person.

06:27.626 --> 06:30.235
I saw that in everyday life without
meditation

06:30.436 --> 06:33.674
I just could not go beyond, I couldn’t

06:33.875 --> 06:37.862
find that serenity and also that
satisfaction to be found in little things.

06:38.063 --> 06:41.323
Our message is a message of peace,
Universal peace,

06:41.524 --> 06:45.675
as Shri Mataji always said:
“There cannot be peace in the world

06:45.876 --> 06:47.698
if there is no peace within each of us”.

06:47.899 --> 06:51.072
There are three channels, or nadis,
in which the subtle energy passes:

06:51.273 --> 06:55.135
the central channel of the present,
of equilibrium, of evolution;

06:55.336 --> 06:59.690
the left channel, the blue one,
is the past, the emotions, desires;

06:59.891 --> 07:03.917
the right channel, the yellow one,
is the future, actions, rationality.

07:04.118 --> 07:10.321
What we are now doing is a technique,
one of many, to unload the channels.

07:12.735 --> 07:18.205
Sometimes the evenings are more intense
and there is also time for a dance.
