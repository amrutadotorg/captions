00:00:00.792 --> 00:00:02.709
This centre what we call as "left Vishuddhi".

00:00:02.917 --> 00:00:04.458
Now have you told them about left Vishuddhi?

00:00:04.667 --> 00:00:07.458
Not, not specific sides, you know, just the general principle.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.542
All right. Now, this left Vishuddhi comes to you

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:14.000
if you have said mantras wrongly.

00:00:14.208 --> 00:00:17.959
You see, the mantras are to be said only when there is

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:22.999
a realised soul who knows what mantras are to be said.

00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:27.792
And if you do not know

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.917
about it, you accept the mantras.

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:35.625
Anybody who tells you, "Say this mantra", you just start saying it,

00:00:35.834 --> 00:00:41.333
without understanding, whether it is given by an authority or not.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:45.792
Also you don't know whether it is meant for you or not.

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.709
Maybe it is not required for some.

00:00:47.917 --> 00:00:50.333
Any particular mantra may not be required.

00:00:50.583 --> 00:00:53.709
And some of the mantras are absolutely absurd things.

00:00:54.041 --> 00:00:57.208
So mantras also, it's a very big science.

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:01.166
And just now I am feeling the left Vishuddhi.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.333
Also one feels it, even if you have not taken mantras, if

00:01:05.542 --> 00:01:07.166
you have been feeling guilty.

00:01:07.375 --> 00:01:11.709
Like, you see, if you are used to confessions and things like that,

00:01:11.917 --> 00:01:17.250
if you are used to a situation where you feel that

00:01:17.583 --> 00:01:22.999
"I'm guilty for this". You know, the norms of today's modern life

00:01:23.208 --> 00:01:26.999
are so funny, that even for small thing you have to feel guilty.

00:01:27.208 --> 00:01:30.250
For example if you put the fork in a wrong way,

00:01:30.458 --> 00:01:33.083
you feel guilty: "Oh God, I should not have done this."

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.166
Like that, the life is so complicated,

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.458
but very, very small things can also make you feel guilty.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:43.291
So if you are feeling guilty also you feel this centre very much.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.375
Now, this centre is very important, because

00:01:50.375 --> 00:01:55.125
if this centre is not all right, then Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.667
She pulls

00:01:57.875 --> 00:02:01.583
this, at this point. Half of it is pulled out.

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:05.917
And there is a blockage. And so Kundalini does not rise.

00:02:06.125 --> 00:02:10.083
Now, one should not feel guilty about anything, whatsoever!

00:02:10.375 --> 00:02:13.750
There is nothing to feel guilty or to going for confessions

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.375
and all the time saying, "I am such a sinner"

00:02:16.583 --> 00:02:20.083
and I should not have done this and I should not have done that.

00:02:20.333 --> 00:02:25.417
Because, as I told you yesterday, God is the ocean of love,

00:02:25.667 --> 00:02:31.667
He is the ocean of compassion and He is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.125
So we should not unnecessarily condemn ourselves.

00:02:36.417 --> 00:02:39.625
Moreover you are the temple of God.

00:02:39.834 --> 00:02:41.709
And if you condemn yourself like that,

00:02:41.917 --> 00:02:45.625
that "I'm good for nothing, I am useless",

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:50.375
then you are condemning that temple which is created by God.

00:02:50.583 --> 00:02:52.458
You have not created yourself.

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:54.959
So you have no right to condemn yourself.

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:57.750
Now little mistakes if you have done doesn't matter.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.792
Because I am talking of the ocean.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:04.333
So little mistakes here and there can always be corrected.

00:03:04.667 --> 00:03:06.208
So one should not feel guilty.

00:03:06.417 --> 00:03:09.250
Now see, are you feeling the vibrations now? Let's see.
