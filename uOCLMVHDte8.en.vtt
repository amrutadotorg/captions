00:00:08.079 --> 00:00:10.839
The relationship between you and Me

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:13.279
is of course very intimate,

00:00:13.439 --> 00:00:15.919
that you should be in My body,

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:21.359
but if you people are not meditating

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:26.519
is very mundane thing I must tell you – Dhyanagamya

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.759
if you are not meditating,

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:33.279
then I have no relationship with you.

00:00:33.439 --> 00:00:36.159
You are not My relation.

00:00:36.359 --> 00:00:39.079
You have no right on Me.

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:40.999
You have no question to be asked,

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.359
why this is happening, why that is happening.

00:00:44.919 --> 00:00:50.599
So if you do not meditate – I always say meditate, meditate

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.199
I have nothing to do with you.

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:56.759
Are no more there for Me.

00:00:56.919 --> 00:01:00.919
It has no connection with Me.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.999
Then you are like all other people.

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:04.439
You may be Sahaja yogis,

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:07.599
you might have got your Sahaja Yoga degree

00:01:07.839 --> 00:01:11.159
from your leaders maybe, I don’t know,

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.839
and maybe that you are regarded as something very great.

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:19.319
But, if you do not do your meditation

00:01:19.519 --> 00:01:22.759
every day, evening, morning or evening,

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:30.359
you will be really not anymore in the realm of Shri Mataji.

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.439
Because the connection is only through gyana,

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:37.919
through meditation.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.279
I have known people who do not do meditation.

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.599
Then they suffer, their children suffer, then something happens;

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.519
then they start coming and telling Me.

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.519
But I see clearly that the person is not meditating,

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:51.759
I have no relationship with him.

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.559
He has no right to ask Me anything.

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:00.919
In the beginning of course, the meditation takes some time.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.279
But once you will know what is meditation is,

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.759
how you enjoy My company, how you are one with Me,

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:11.599
how we can have a rapport with each other.

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:15.439
There’s no need to have anything else in between,

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.010
like writing letters or maybe some sort

00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.519
of a special connection, nothing of the kind!

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:26.839
Only thing that is needed is the meditation.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.279
In meditation you grow.

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:33.519
In that spiritually you become higher.

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:39.439
And when that happens, you start,

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.079
in a way, I would say

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:47.759
that when you reach a state of

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:54.679
that, I should say, maturity in Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:57.679
then you don’t want to give up your meditation.

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:01.879
Because that time, you are absolutely one with Me.

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:05.839
That doesn’t mean for three hours, four hours you should do meditation

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:10.919
but it is how much intensely you are with Me is important;

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:16.519
now it is not how much time you are with Me.

00:03:16.679 --> 00:03:18.839
Then I’m responsible for you,

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:20.679
for your children, for everyone.

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.599
I am responsible for your ascent, for your protection,

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:30.359
to save you from all your negativity.

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:33.639
So it’s not like a father

00:03:33.839 --> 00:03:36.759
who will directly punish you,

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:38.759
it’s not that, but it’s just

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:44.519
“All right, you are not My relation, I am out.”

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:47.279
That’s the only thing that can happen.

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:49.679
If you are not meditating, all right,

00:03:49.839 --> 00:03:53.279
I cannot force you, I have nothing to do with you.

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.759
You may have other relationship, outside, outward.

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.279
But this inner relationship, by which you get your benevolence,

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:05.599
you cannot have without meditation.

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.199
I’ve been telling all of you, please meditate,

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:10.519
please meditate every day.

00:04:10.679 --> 00:04:14.359
But I think people are also not understanding

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.919
the importance of what I am saying,

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:21.111
because they tell Me, “Mother, we don’t meditate.”

00:04:21.192 --> 00:04:22.359
“Why?”

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.680
“Now we are realized soul, so why should we meditate?”

00:04:27.519 --> 00:04:29.679
Now this instrument is fully made,

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.519
but if it is not all the time connected for the mains,

00:04:32.679 --> 00:04:37.199
what’s the use of having it.

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:41.359
In that meditation, you will feel the Love,

00:04:41.559 --> 00:04:44.359
the divine Love, the beauty of that divine Love,

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:48.919
a complete panorama changes.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.519
A meditative person has a very different attitude,

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.679
a very different temperament,

00:04:54.839 --> 00:04:58.199
a very different life and he lives always

00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:02.279
in complete satisfaction with himself.

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.079
So today as being the first day, as you say,

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:12.519
of the Advent, say, we can say that it is the first day

00:05:12.679 --> 00:05:16.439
when the Advent took place, as we are worshipping today

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:21.159
of course it was not today, but still we can say that if that is so.

00:05:21.359 --> 00:05:28.159
If it has happened and it has been helpful to you,

00:05:28.359 --> 00:05:32.519
it has been a great blessing to you,

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:35.199
then must know how to preserve it,

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.439
must know how to enhance it,

00:05:37.679 --> 00:05:40.919
must know how to enjoy it.

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:46.959
You should not just get satisfied with one, or can say,

00:05:47.159 --> 00:05:51.359
one last drama, or one this thing, one that

00:05:51.599 --> 00:05:56.759
But you should have a full oneness

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:59.199
with the Divine, full oneness.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:02.759
And that is possible only if you really meditate,

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:07.639
which is quite a easy thing to do, to meditate is.

00:06:07.839 --> 00:06:10.919
Some people say, Mother, we cannot get over time,

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.519
we cannot think … we are all the time thinking something,

00:06:14.679 --> 00:06:20.359
or that time we want to see the watch.

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:23.519
In the beginning we may have a little problem,

00:06:23.679 --> 00:06:26.079
I’m not saying, you may not have, you may have,

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:28.079
but that’s only in the beginning.

00:06:28.279 --> 00:06:32.359
But gradually you will be all right.

00:06:32.999 --> 00:06:35.919
Gradually you will master it.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:39.159
Gradually you will know it so well

00:06:39.359 --> 00:06:42.519
that you would not like to have anything else

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:46.159
of a cheaper type, you wouldn’t care for such a thing.

00:06:46.359 --> 00:06:50.999
You see, so to get to your beauty,

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:55.519
to get to your glory, to get to your own great personality

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:58.159
which is now exposed,

00:06:58.359 --> 00:07:01.599
only thing you have to do really religiously

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:04.199
is to meditate.

00:07:05.665 --> 00:07:09.065
Everyday you should do meditation.

00:07:09.225 --> 00:07:12.585
Those who do not do meditation

00:07:12.745 --> 00:07:16.625
are capable of falling down.

00:07:16.785 --> 00:07:24.305
Because meditation is like putting oil into the lamp.

00:07:24.465 --> 00:07:28.865
Those who do not meditate, think they can do without it,

00:07:29.025 --> 00:07:31.385
are sadly mistaken.

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:37.865
They have to meditate, morning and evening.

00:07:38.065 --> 00:07:42.785
The problem is everything comes so handy,

00:07:42.945 --> 00:07:45.105
so simple,

00:07:45.265 --> 00:07:49.905
that they don’t understand that meditation is very important.

00:07:50.065 --> 00:07:52.545
Many people.

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:57.145
Not you, but there are many I know, who get Realization,

00:07:57.305 --> 00:08:00.465
who don’t meditate.

00:08:00.625 --> 00:08:07.185
And their style is different,

00:08:07.345 --> 00:08:10.265
their nature is different.

00:08:10.425 --> 00:08:12.945
Meditation is such a soothing thing,

00:08:13.105 --> 00:08:21.305
such a beautiful way of connection with the Divine,

00:08:21.465 --> 00:08:25.425
that all your problems get solved

00:08:25.585 --> 00:08:28.705
in that meditative mood.

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:32.505
If you are not meditating,

00:08:32.665 --> 00:08:36.705
you are not following meditation,

00:08:36.865 --> 00:08:39.865
then maybe your light will go down,

00:08:40.025 --> 00:08:43.545
it won’t give sufficient light.

00:08:47.305 --> 00:08:50.505
Is important, very important,

00:08:51.345 --> 00:08:56.545
to find out about yourself, about others

00:08:56.705 --> 00:08:59.705
in the meditation.

00:08:59.865 --> 00:09:04.065
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

00:09:04.225 --> 00:09:06.545
Don’t do anything

00:09:06.705 --> 00:09:10.385
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

00:09:10.545 --> 00:09:13.305
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

00:09:13.465 --> 00:09:19.345
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

00:09:19.505 --> 00:09:21.785
you’ve done your job.

00:09:21.945 --> 00:09:24.385
Because that’s the point where

00:09:24.545 --> 00:09:29.065
you are with the truth, with the reality,

00:09:29.225 --> 00:09:30.625
with the joy,

00:09:30.785 --> 00:09:34.985
with everything that is so fundamental.

00:09:35.145 --> 00:09:39.185
When you meditate, try not to,

00:09:39.345 --> 00:09:46.105
not to make some sort of a function out of it, no.

00:09:46.265 --> 00:09:50.505
Meditation is something silencing your Self,

00:09:50.665 --> 00:09:55.705
silencing your thoughts and the going

00:09:55.865 --> 00:10:00.105
to that deep ocean which is within you itself.

00:10:00.265 --> 00:10:04.265
But supposing you don’t do that.

00:10:04.425 --> 00:10:06.385
If you don’t meditate,

00:10:06.545 --> 00:10:09.065
I can make out immediately

00:10:09.225 --> 00:10:12.145
those who are meditating and those who are not

00:10:12.305 --> 00:10:14.865
It’s not difficult for Me.

00:10:15.025 --> 00:10:19.665
Those who do not meditate are always hesitating,

00:10:20.585 --> 00:10:25.865
they are confused, they can’t understand.

00:10:26.025 --> 00:10:29.945
And that’s why meditation

00:10:30.105 --> 00:10:34.345
is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

00:10:34.505 --> 00:10:38.225
Just like a light burns,

00:10:38.385 --> 00:10:41.545
in the electricity flowing in it, you can say,

00:10:41.705 --> 00:10:45.585
or by, because of the candles,

00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:49.145
in the same way meditation

00:10:49.305 --> 00:10:58.225
is a ‘continuous’ availability of the Divine Force.

00:10:58.425 --> 00:11:02.545
That will reduce all your apprehensions.

00:11:02.705 --> 00:11:04.585
Not only that,

00:11:04.745 --> 00:11:09.105
but takes out all the negative thoughts,

00:11:09.265 --> 00:11:15.345
it takes out all the discouraging things.

00:11:15.505 --> 00:11:19.545
And when you are meditating like that,

00:11:19.705 --> 00:11:22.585
thoughtless awareness,

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:27.185
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

00:11:27.345 --> 00:11:31.505
from within and without.

00:11:31.665 --> 00:11:34.625
It’s a terrible power that works,

00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:37.305
this thoughtless awareness.

00:11:37.465 --> 00:11:41.785
So those who do not meditate

00:11:41.945 --> 00:11:44.545
cannot go very much far

00:11:44.705 --> 00:11:48.225
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:48.385 --> 00:11:51.545
One should try to meditate

00:11:51.705 --> 00:11:56.265
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

00:11:56.985 --> 00:12:00.265
So, what happens to you?

00:12:00.425 --> 00:12:03.625
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

00:12:03.785 --> 00:12:06.305
what happens to you?

00:12:06.465 --> 00:12:14.305
Is that you get the confidence,

00:12:14.465 --> 00:12:19.665
complete confidence of Divinity,

00:12:20.469 --> 00:12:23.589
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

00:12:23.749 --> 00:12:27.709
is only possible when you meditate

00:12:27.869 --> 00:12:31.229
and become thoughtlessly aware.

00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:37.509
That’s the point where Divine works.

00:12:37.669 --> 00:12:39.789
It helps you.

00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:45.229
It comes to your help in such a way

00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:50.389
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

00:12:50.549 --> 00:12:54.829
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

00:12:54.989 --> 00:12:57.789
all of you should achieve.

00:12:57.949 --> 00:13:00.149
Very important.

00:13:00.309 --> 00:13:05.269
After that you can achieve something else,

00:13:05.429 --> 00:13:09.349
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

00:13:09.525 --> 00:13:16.365
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

00:13:16.509 --> 00:13:19.989
because then there are no thoughts coming

00:13:20.149 --> 00:13:25.469
from the left or right, from the present or the future.

00:13:25.629 --> 00:13:30.469
Just in the present you are there.

00:13:30.629 --> 00:13:34.989
Is something you all have, is not that

00:13:35.149 --> 00:13:37.309
Me, I’m saying that to you,

00:13:37.469 --> 00:13:39.549
but all of you have this.

00:13:39.709 --> 00:13:41.509
But ‘steady yourself’!

00:13:41.669 --> 00:13:46.189
You have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness.

00:13:46.349 --> 00:13:48.829
How long, that’s not the point.

00:13:48.989 --> 00:13:51.549
The point is once you touched it,

00:13:51.709 --> 00:13:54.069
you’ll go on touching it.

00:13:54.229 --> 00:14:01.029
Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on,

00:14:01.189 --> 00:14:06.589
they are not thoughtlessly silent.

00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:11.509
Now this is the one point which is very important.

00:14:11.669 --> 00:14:14.149
If you have to grow,

00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:17.789
you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine

00:14:17.949 --> 00:14:20.309
through thoughtless awareness.

00:14:20.469 --> 00:14:22.309
You don’t have to pray,

00:14:22.469 --> 00:14:24.909
you don’t have to call anyone, nothing,

00:14:25.069 --> 00:14:27.949
it just works because it is within you.

00:14:28.109 --> 00:14:30.269
All these thoughts are bombarding

00:14:30.429 --> 00:14:33.349
from both the sides in your mind.

00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:36.149
These thoughts that are coming to you

00:14:36.309 --> 00:14:38.989
have no meaning with you,

00:14:39.149 --> 00:14:42.069
they do not substantiate.

00:14:42.229 --> 00:14:45.389
Yourself you are an ocean

00:14:45.549 --> 00:14:51.989
and you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness.

00:14:53.431 --> 00:14:56.951
So, today’s message is that:

00:14:57.151 --> 00:15:02.711
“While meditating, go into thoughtless awareness.”

00:15:02.871 --> 00:15:06.311
No thought is important,

00:15:06.471 --> 00:15:09.631
because it’s your own creation.

00:15:09.791 --> 00:15:14.151
But if you have to become with the Divine Creation,

00:15:14.311 --> 00:15:18.551
you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness,

00:15:18.711 --> 00:15:21.231
minimum of minimum.

00:15:21.391 --> 00:15:24.911
Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow

00:15:25.071 --> 00:15:27.911
and you’ll be amazed how

00:15:28.071 --> 00:15:32.362
you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way.

00:15:32.838 --> 00:15:38.908
Meditation is for you, to go deep down into yourself,

00:15:38.988 --> 00:15:43.557
to achieve all that your Sahasrara wants to give you.

00:15:43.638 --> 00:15:48.618
To achieve that height of detachment,

00:15:48.988 --> 00:15:55.386
of understanding is only through meditation.

00:15:55.467 --> 00:15:57.947
So what happens in meditation is

00:15:58.028 --> 00:16:04.253
that your awareness crosses over Agnya, goes above,

00:16:04.539 --> 00:16:10.878
and is now stationed in the Sahasrara, in thoughtless awareness.

00:16:10.958 --> 00:16:16.587
Then the reality of Sahasrara, the beauty of Sahasrara,

00:16:16.674 --> 00:16:21.838
starts pouring in your own character, in your own temperament.

00:16:21.918 --> 00:16:26.083
Unless and until you meditate, not meditate just to get well

00:16:26.164 --> 00:16:29.134
or just to feel that “I must meditate“.

00:16:29.215 --> 00:16:32.878
But meditation is very important for all of you

00:16:32.958 --> 00:16:36.788
that you develop your Sahasrara in such a manner

00:16:36.878 --> 00:16:41.818
that you imbibe the beauty of your Sahasrara.

00:16:41.898 --> 00:16:45.908
If you don’t use your Sahasrara in this way,

00:16:45.988 --> 00:16:49.898
after some time you’ll find Sahasrara will close down,

00:16:49.978 --> 00:16:51.858
you’ll have no vibrations

00:16:51.938 --> 00:16:55.521
and you’ll have no understanding of yourself.

00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:58.539
So very, very important thing is to meditate.

00:16:58.619 --> 00:17:02.589
I can immediately make out a person who has been meditating

00:17:02.669 --> 00:17:07.469
and the one who has not been meditating.

00:17:07.549 --> 00:17:10.669
Because a person who does not meditate he still thinks that

00:17:10.749 --> 00:17:14.459
“Oh, it’s alright, I’m doing this, I’m doing that.”

00:17:14.539 --> 00:17:17.609
Meditation is the only way you can

00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:24.499
enrich yourself with the beauty of reality.

00:17:24.579 --> 00:17:26.149
There’s no other way.

00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:30.193
I cannot find any other way but meditation

00:17:30.274 --> 00:17:36.539
by which you rise into the realm of divinity.

00:17:37.001 --> 00:17:40.121
So today is a day when you have to promise Me

00:17:40.202 --> 00:17:42.636
that you’ll meditate every night,

00:17:42.732 --> 00:17:46.266
every evening, maybe in the morning also.

00:17:46.377 --> 00:17:50.470
Whenever it is possible if you can go into a meditative mood,

00:17:50.551 --> 00:17:55.671
you are in contact with this Divine power.

00:17:56.350 --> 00:18:02.240
Then, whatever is good for you, whatever good for your society,

00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:07.300
for your country, all is done by this Divine power.

00:18:07.380 --> 00:18:11.360
You don’t have to overpower the Divine power,

00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.239
you don’t have to order, you don’t have to ask,

00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:22.009
just if you meditate you are one with this All-pervading Power

00:18:22.090 --> 00:18:27.090
which is another great blessing to us.

00:18:32.008 --> 00:18:37.596
We are the ones who are going to support, look after the Satya Yuga.

00:18:37.596 --> 00:18:40.736
And that’s why the Sahasrara opening is very,

00:18:40.816 --> 00:18:44.504
very important, it’s very important.

00:18:44.585 --> 00:18:52.595
And those who want to grow should meditate every day,

00:18:52.676 --> 00:18:55.596
whatever time you may come home, maybe in the morning,

00:18:55.676 --> 00:18:57.706
maybe in the evening, anytime.

00:18:57.796 --> 00:19:00.656
But you will know that you are meditating when

00:19:00.736 --> 00:19:05.493
you can get into thoughtless awareness, then you will know.

00:19:05.574 --> 00:19:07.484
Your reaction will be zero.

00:19:07.565 --> 00:19:09.535
Look at something you will just look at it,

00:19:10.036 --> 00:19:12.562
you won`t react, because you are thoughtless.

00:19:13.192 --> 00:19:15.152
You won`t react.

00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:18.343
When that reaction is not there then everything,

00:19:18.424 --> 00:19:22.697
you’ll be surprised, is Divine.

00:19:22.778 --> 00:19:26.576
Because reaction is your Agnyas problem.

00:19:27.191 --> 00:19:30.653
Once you are absolutely thoughtlessly aware,

00:19:30.734 --> 00:19:32.895
you are one with the Divine.

00:19:32.976 --> 00:19:37.712
So much so that the Divine takes over, every activity,

00:19:37.793 --> 00:19:42.795
every moment of your life and looks after you.

00:19:42.876 --> 00:19:47.676
And you feel completely secured, one with the Divine.

00:19:47.756 --> 00:19:50.696
And enjoy the blessings of the Divine.

00:19:50.826 --> 00:19:53.958
May God bless you!
