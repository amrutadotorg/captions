00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:18.630
[HINDI - We all are really fortunate. Mataji
graciously gives us Her darshan every year,]

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:25.498
[HINDI - to be at Her feet and blesses us
with Her Grace. The tongue doesn't have]

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:33.092
[HINDI - the power to praise Her. Every
word or rather golden word is spoken by Her]

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.340
[HINDI - I understand you all are very
eager to hear her Pravachan, so I]

00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:06.511

00:04:16.153 --> 00:04:20.456
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - I will speak in Hindi. I am
speaking to our people they will understand]

00:04:20.456 --> 00:04:26.164

They are sitting in meditation]
President: [HINDI - Okay (UNCLEAR)]

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:29.140
Shri Mataji: Okay, first I will speak
for sometime in English]

00:05:16.275 --> 00:05:23.215
[HINDI - I bow to all time (sarva sanatan)
real devotees]

00:05:27.127 --> 00:05:39.007
[HINDI - I thank all the administrators of this 
place, especially the President, Mr. Chugh and]

00:05:39.247 --> 00:05:48.827
[HINDI - the various organizers of Sanatan
Dharma Temple that every time]

00:05:48.827 --> 00:06:00.891
[HINDI - such an auspicious occasion for
Me, very joy-giving, extremely pleasant]

00:06:05.171 --> 00:06:11.481
[HINDI - very beautiful is reflected
here in this Temple.]

00:06:12.341 --> 00:06:24.041
[HINDI - The biggest reason for this is that,
whichever great persons have been here before,]

00:06:24.041 --> 00:06:33.434
[HINDI - the Incarnations, were not understood
by anyone. You must have heard that when]

00:06:33.434 --> 00:06:41.606
[HINDI - Gyaneshwaraji went to the temples,
he was disallowed. Namadeva was also not]

00:06:41.606 --> 00:06:47.395
HINDI - allowed in the temples. Janabai
was also disallowed to enter the temples]

00:06:47.457 --> 00:06:52.307
[HINDI - Similarly, wherever there were
great saints, the doors to the temples,]

00:06:52.307 --> 00:07:00.669
[HINDI - I don't know why, were always shut
for them but in today's modern situation]

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:08.657
[HINDI - I find this very special, that the
administrators and organizers of our temples]

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:15.053
[HINDI - recognize and understand the
Truth, this is your great (Param) destiny]

00:07:17.177 --> 00:07:25.927
[HINDI - because if we had such temples
which denied all saints and sadhus, then only]

00:07:25.927 --> 00:07:32.109
[HINDI - such people could have made a place for
themselves, who were interested only in money.]

00:07:36.582 --> 00:07:46.092
[HINDI - Thus, where a person is so open-minded
that he can recognize the Truth, there]

00:07:46.892 --> 00:07:52.342
[HINDI - people like Me, are so joyous,
this you can understand.]

00:07:53.588 --> 00:08:03.978
[HINDI - Since times immemorial, this Sanatan 
(Eternal) religion(dharma) has also been tried]

00:08:03.978 --> 00:08:11.700
[HINDI - to be perverted but today it is proved,
when I come to this temple, that sanatan(eternal)]

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:17.998
[HINDI - has remained sanatan(eternal) till
now. Whatever was useless, has dropped off,]

00:08:17.998 --> 00:08:23.751
[HINDI - whichever mistakes there were, are
finished and have come to that stage that]

00:08:23.751 --> 00:08:31.725
[HINDI - once again we have started to
recognize it. The Eternal religion people]

00:08:31.725 --> 00:08:38.231
[HINDI - have recognized the most and if I'm
told to deliver My speech some where else,]

00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:41.671
[HINDI - it would be very difficult - 
people will not recognize it.]

00:08:45.544 --> 00:08:54.054
[HINDI - That's why I very joyous to come here.
After speaking for sometime]

00:08:54.054 --> 00:08:59.670
[HINDI - in English, then I'll tell you
about the Kundalini in Hindi]

00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:08.300
I've been praising this place, which is
a temple of God for one thing that

00:09:08.983 --> 00:09:17.213
in these modern times, the people of
Sanatan Dharam, of the Eternal religion,

00:09:20.208 --> 00:09:29.208
have come to such an enlightenment
that they can respect the Truth.

00:09:30.863 --> 00:09:37.183
We can't imagine such a thing
happening in the churches of the West.

00:09:39.711 --> 00:09:44.711
They can never accept the truth - is
impossible; Can you think of such a thing?

00:09:46.947 --> 00:09:56.567
They are also coming from the same Tree of
Life which preached about righteousness,

00:09:56.567 --> 00:10:01.309
about dharma, about Christ -
about all the great things

00:10:01.403 --> 00:10:09.313
that Sanatan Dharm has been talking about.
But in the West anywhere, can you think a

00:10:09.313 --> 00:10:18.794
church inviting Me to speak to the audience?
But also I must tell you one thing.

00:10:19.146 --> 00:10:25.736
When I went to Geneva for the first time
- of course the church did not arrange -

00:10:26.007 --> 00:10:33.507
but we arranged a program in a temple and
then some people very hideously came forward

00:10:34.256 --> 00:10:42.516
and tried to be nasty to us but the Vice
President of that church supported Me out

00:10:42.516 --> 00:10:48.044
and out and he gave an article about Me,
that, "What She says, is the Truth and we

00:10:48.044 --> 00:10:55.295
must listen to Her." And the second person, when
the President came back from his holidays,

00:10:55.489 --> 00:11:06.349
he also supported and he published a great
article about Me. So, the beginning has started.

00:11:09.226 --> 00:11:23.026
But, to see how in this temple, they accept
Me as one of themselves, as the Person

00:11:23.026 --> 00:11:35.448
who has to give them the Truth, this is a very big
advancement, I would say, in the enlightenment.

00:11:36.985 --> 00:11:49.455
While people coming from any other religion,
any other, resist - they cannot recognize -

00:11:50.074 --> 00:11:57.304
I must admit. Of course, we have many
Muslim disciples like this and we have

00:11:57.304 --> 00:12:07.986
many Sikh disciples, we have Parsis also
but everybody resists that. The whole society

00:12:07.986 --> 00:12:16.685
goes against that - it's true. But readily the
way Sanatan dharam has accepted Sahaja yoga,

00:12:16.685 --> 00:12:27.315
is very remarkable and that is how we are
going to penetrate into North India through

00:12:27.315 --> 00:12:33.715
Sanatan Dharam - there is no way out. Because
those who are intellectuals, don't believe in

00:12:33.715 --> 00:12:35.881
any dharam - Sanatan or Asanatan.

00:12:39.171 --> 00:12:45.081
Even the Arya Samajis won't accept Me
at all because they don't believe in deities.

00:12:52.341 --> 00:12:58.411
The openness of the Sanatan Dharam
proves that it is an Eternal religion.

00:13:01.005 --> 00:13:07.475
Because in this country thousands of
years back, many rishis and munis

00:13:08.096 --> 00:13:13.296
went into meditation to find out the
Eternal Truths of religion.

00:13:13.406 --> 00:13:21.566
It has no organization as such, and
whatever they propounded, was accepted.

00:13:24.696 --> 00:13:34.276
Afterwards, so many things went wrong.
Brahminism came into power, it corrupted

00:13:34.658 --> 00:13:45.008
practices but still, I must say, the principle
of Sanatan Dharam, could not be disturbed.

00:13:47.065 --> 00:13:53.135
You can see the result of that in this temple
and in many places where I go, is the

00:13:53.135 --> 00:14:03.712
Sanatan Dharam people who understand the
Truth. Sanatan Dharam is based on the principle

00:14:03.712 --> 00:14:13.599
of Shakti, in the Power of the Mother Goddess.
Even in Veda She is described as the

00:14:13.599 --> 00:14:22.569
Primordial Mother and She is called as
'Ee'. But the people who wanted to have an

00:14:22.569 --> 00:14:29.803
intellectual basis for that, like Arya 
Samajist, avoided all that; They didn't

00:14:29.803 --> 00:14:36.398
want to talk about it. They took that part of
Vedas, which did not deal with any deities.

00:14:39.201 --> 00:14:45.111
Now in Sahaja yoga, I've proved beyond doubt,
that we have these Deities within ourselves.

00:14:47.344 --> 00:14:53.194
Even the people, who are following Sanatan
Dharam, have to revitalize themselves

00:14:53.194 --> 00:15:01.611
and go deep into it and to find out what are
significances of all the living deities that we

00:15:01.611 --> 00:15:10.077
call of from the Mother Earth. Now, one
of the objections people have in the West,

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:20.390
that in the Ten Commandments it is said, that 
'You should not worship any statue' - is not so.

00:15:21.402 --> 00:15:29.222
The Commandment is that, "Whatever is produced
or created by the Mother Earth or the Heavens

00:15:29.222 --> 00:15:36.560
should not be reproduced and worshiped."
What is created by Mother Earth,

00:15:37.324 --> 00:15:49.184
they don't want to find out. All the living
or we call them 'jagrut' or 'swayambhu'

00:15:49.661 --> 00:15:56.631
deities in this country, are created by
Mother Earth, so they are to be worshiped.

00:15:58.418 --> 00:16:06.038
Now this worshiping went on to such a horrible
condition, that people started producing

00:16:06.038 --> 00:16:12.014
statutes after statues, statues after statues.
For that also in Sanatan Dharma, is written

00:16:12.014 --> 00:16:16.605
"There should be a Prana Pratishtha
by a Brahmin." Clearly written.

00:16:18.198 --> 00:16:22.358
Now Prana Pratishtha by a Brahmin, it
means Brahmin who knows the Brahma -

00:16:22.403 --> 00:16:27.463
that's also clearly given. Any Dick, Tom
and Harry cannot be a Brahmin. So the

00:16:27.463 --> 00:16:32.207
Prana Pratishtha of the Deity has to be done
by a Brahmin means, he should be awakened

00:16:32.207 --> 00:16:37.027
and then it should be worshiped. But nobody
followed these rules. It went down so much

00:16:37.396 --> 00:16:42.866
that Gurunanaka had to come, Kabira had
to come and talk about the abstract God

00:16:42.866 --> 00:16:50.768
because there was no way out to cut it
short. They were great people who brought

00:16:50.768 --> 00:17:00.953
this knowledge to people but that also is
followed to such a extent that people don't

00:17:00.953 --> 00:17:07.461
want to see that the Truth lies in finding
yourself, in Atma-sakshatkar, in finding

00:17:07.461 --> 00:17:17.586
your own Spirit. So, that's how the problem
came in. He too has said that the whole universe

00:17:17.586 --> 00:17:25.611
was created by the Primordial Mother. But the
way he saw the people worshiped the deities

00:17:26.336 --> 00:17:33.456
and the way people misused it, he had to
talk of the abstract God. So that's how,

00:17:33.456 --> 00:17:39.740
we had another side of correction but
whenever you try to correct, the followers

00:17:39.740 --> 00:17:45.444
try to take it to another extreme. Like the
Sanatanies went to one extreme, these also

00:17:45.444 --> 00:17:51.254
went to another extremes but the Truth
remains the Truth. Whatever one may try to

00:17:51.254 --> 00:17:58.586
spoil it, the Truth remains the Truth. Now
Truth is to be seen, to be felt, to be

00:17:58.586 --> 00:18:03.211
experienced and to not to be believed
in your head. As I told yesterday, that

00:18:03.211 --> 00:18:10.522
mental projection cannot give you the Truth.
Supposing, you hear about Me, I'm such and such

00:18:10.522 --> 00:18:18.310
and you haven't seen Me, then what's the
use? You have to know Me personally,

00:18:19.509 --> 00:18:26.759
you have to meet Me, then only you will know
the Truth. And this is one of the reasons

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:32.427
people can say that they did not believe
in any Gods or Goddesses and now that there are

00:18:32.427 --> 00:18:38.000
many who do not believe in any religion
whatsoever that they say there is no religion.

00:18:40.762 --> 00:18:49.902
Sahaja yoga today, is going to integrate
all of them and is going to show how

00:18:49.992 --> 00:19:00.502
all these great people, even Gurunanaka, Kabira,
Buddha, Mahavira, Rama, Krishna, Christ,

00:19:00.771 --> 00:19:08.561
Mohammad - all these people are part and
parcel of one tree and how we are fighting

00:19:08.561 --> 00:19:16.746
for nothing at all. It can be shown, it can
be proved - the condition of Sahaja yoga is,

00:19:16.746 --> 00:19:27.416
that whatever we say, has to be proved. So
this is how today, on your behalf, of the

00:19:27.416 --> 00:19:37.796
Western Sahaja yogis, specially, I thank
the organizers of this temple for showing

00:19:38.318 --> 00:19:50.208
such sense of understanding and such
great appreciation of the Truth.

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:11.668
[HINDI - If anybody talks about God in this modern
world, people think it is a means of entertainment]

00:20:12.148 --> 00:20:20.208
[HINDI - It can only entertain. There can be no
such thing as God, for entertainment it is okay]

00:20:20.208 --> 00:20:28.405
[HINDI - Now that our grandparents are old
so they go and sit in the temple and spend

00:20:28.405 --> 00:20:32.720
[HINDI - their time; It's a good way. Instead
of troubling the daughter-in-law at home]

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:35.278
[HINDI - it's better that they to go to
the temple and spend their time]

00:20:35.278 --> 00:20:40.996
[HINDI - Nowadays the temple has no
other meaning than this in our society.]

00:20:42.019 --> 00:20:46.261
[HINDI - People think that the God who is
sitting there in the temple is only there]

00:20:46.261 --> 00:20:53.875
[HINDI - so that they can go and share their
woes and sorrows and it should be all cured]

00:20:57.564 --> 00:21:02.494
[HINDI - But what are these temples, 
what are the Gods sitting in the temple]

00:21:02.494 --> 00:21:07.658
[HINDI - what is our relation to Them and
how should we be connected to Them etc]

00:21:07.658 --> 00:21:16.480
[HINDI - many things are still secret. And
all these things have been there since ages]

00:21:16.648 --> 00:21:24.478
[HINDI - You know that Indra had also to be
given Self realization - that's why immemorial]

00:21:24.609 --> 00:21:33.559
[HINDI - While doing all these things, in the
sixth century, when the greatest propagator]

00:21:33.559 --> 00:21:39.479
[HINDI - of Hindu religion, Adi Shankaracharya
came in this world, then he openly started talking]

00:21:39.479 --> 00:21:42.310
[HINDI - about all these things. Otherwise
we had one Bhakti marg(Devotional way)]

00:21:42.310 --> 00:21:46.607
[HINDI - and the other was the path of Vedas
by which Gayatri mantra etc were done]

00:21:48.321 --> 00:21:52.771
[HINDI - Whenever people used to be so
engrossed in Devotion that they became useless]

00:21:52.771 --> 00:21:56.094
[HINDI - then such people used to come
to pull them out of it who said,]

00:21:56.094 --> 00:22:02.328
[HINDI - "Give up devotion and take your
attention to the formless(abstract),"]

00:22:02.328 --> 00:22:06.452
[HINDI - because they were drifting so
much towards the form(idol) and when they]

00:22:06.452 --> 00:22:09.041
[HINDI - drifted too much towards the
formless, people came to to say,]

00:22:09.041 --> 00:22:12.180
[HINDI - "The Formless is not at all
helpful, we should take to the Form."]

00:22:12.209 --> 00:22:17.059
[HINDI - But the people moved like
a pendulum from here to there]

00:22:18.032 --> 00:22:25.692
[HINDI - And thus by all this the human being
understood that in this there is devotion]

00:22:25.692 --> 00:22:32.106
[HINDI - as well as abstract form
- it is Onkar as well as Krishna.

00:22:34.337 --> 00:22:37.627
[HINDI - Nothing can be gained
without this.]

00:22:40.793 --> 00:22:46.163
[HINDI - In Sahaja yoga you get the
sight(darshan) of both. You can see/view]

00:22:46.163 --> 00:22:53.170
[HINDI - the Brahma as well as all these
Gods. The Power of Brahma is the]

00:22:53.306 --> 00:23:00.906
[HINDI - Power of love of God Almighty which
moves all around us and all the living work of]

00:23:00.906 --> 00:23:07.157
[HINDI - the world, for example turning a flower
to a fruit etc, all the living work is done by it]

00:23:07.157 --> 00:23:13.384
[HINDI - It also works in us, which we call
Para Sympathetic Nervous system, in which]

00:23:13.384 --> 00:23:23.290
[HINDI - it moves and works. This is the
power of Brahma and to know this power,]

00:23:23.290 --> 00:23:31.096
[HINDI - the mechanism God has made within us,
the arrangement He has made, is very unique]

00:23:32.967 --> 00:23:45.017
[HINDI - And in order to create this
machinery, in our evolution]

00:23:45.990 --> 00:23:54.340
[HINDI - He has placed various
Gods inside our body only.]

00:23:56.283 --> 00:23:59.383
[HINDI - (ASIDE) Just remove these children
from here. They're making too much noise]

00:23:59.383 --> 00:24:07.565
[HINDI - Different Gods have been placed.
First of all He made Shri Ganesha]

00:24:09.611 --> 00:24:16.781
[HINDI - Shri Ganesha is purity. The
whole world He filled with Purity.]

00:24:16.781 --> 00:24:21.702
[HINDI - In the formless if we say, He
filled with Purity and when we talk]

00:24:21.702 --> 00:24:26.311
[HINDI - of the form, He made Shri Ganesha
- It's one and the same thing.]

00:24:27.339 --> 00:24:36.089
[HINDI - Just like you see over here, it's
burning but it has wick also as well as the light]

00:24:38.948 --> 00:24:45.268
[HINDI - In the same way, the first thing
created was Shri Ganesha, whose light]

00:24:45.268 --> 00:24:49.403
[HINDI - or radiance spreads all around,
which is the Power of God]

00:24:51.449 --> 00:24:55.489
[HINDI - Now if anyone catches hold of only
Ganeshji, that is also wrong and if anyone]

00:24:55.489 --> 00:25:00.431
[HINDI - catches hold of only the light,
is also wrong because as I told you before]

00:25:00.983 --> 00:25:08.203
[HINDI - that first He talked of the variety
of flowers and there is honey in the flowers]

00:25:08.794 --> 00:25:13.174
[HINDI - then people got stuck to the flowers
that, "Seek the flowers, seek the flowers,"]

00:25:13.174 --> 00:25:17.335
[HINDI - just started chanting, means just saying
verbally, means shabd-jalam(web of words)]

00:25:18.819 --> 00:25:25.599
[HINDI - Just started talking, then they
said, "See, the people just looking for flowers]

00:25:25.599 --> 00:25:30.461
[HINDI - have gone crazy" - worshiping the
flowers and running after them - and are]

00:25:30.461 --> 00:25:34.662
[HINDI - not talking about honey at all. Then
they said, "Okay, now let's start talking about the honey."]

00:25:34.662 --> 00:25:39.875
[HINDI - All those who have been great, only for
our benevolence took us out from one to the other]

00:25:39.875 --> 00:25:44.624
[HINDI - then again from the second to the first,
so that somehow we could become sensible]

00:25:44.624 --> 00:25:50.960
[HINDI - Sometimes talk about the formless 'Alakh
Niranjan' - a-la-kh - that which cannot been seen]

00:25:52.239 --> 00:25:57.969
[HINDI - That they started talking but that
also remained just a talk. Even if we talk]

00:25:57.969 --> 00:26:05.130
[HINDI - about the honey or madhu but how
do we find the honey? Then what should happen?]

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:14.634
[HINDI - You should be like a bee able to suck
the honey. You yourself will have to change]

00:26:15.498 --> 00:26:22.068
[HINDI - You should have your Self-realization,
this is said in all the religions]

00:26:23.370 --> 00:26:29.500
[HINDI - because by inter-changing, it strikes
the mind of a person that if this was wrong]

00:26:29.500 --> 00:26:35.360
[HINDI - we should take to the other
thing. But all have said one thing]

00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.911
[HINDI - howsoever much you interchange still one
thing is there, you should have your Self-realization;

00:26:38.911 --> 00:26:44.454
[HINDI - Who hasn't said this? Jesus Christ
has said that,"You should be born again."]

00:26:45.985 --> 00:26:50.465
[HINDI - In the Hindu religion, it is an
established fact, 'Dwijaye te Sadhijaye' that]

00:26:50.465 --> 00:26:54.125
[HINDI - the one who is who born again,
only he knows the Brahm and is a true Brahmin,]

00:26:54.125 --> 00:26:59.483
[HINDI - is said clearly. One may interpret it
wrongly but in reality only this has been said]

00:27:00.518 --> 00:27:08.028
[HINDI - Nanak sahab has said, "Find 
within yourself. Without knowing yourself]

00:27:08.028 --> 00:27:12.592
[HINDI - you cannot know God. Get to
your Spirit," He has said this only.]

00:27:12.932 --> 00:27:17.707
[HINDI - Now everybody is saying the same thing
that, "Get to your Spirit, take your rebirth."]

00:27:17.707 --> 00:27:21.357
[HINDI - Jesus Christ has said the same
thing. Mohammad Sahab has said that,]

00:27:21.357 --> 00:27:27.516
[HINDI - "You have to become a Pir." When
everybody has said the same thing, then]

00:27:27.516 --> 00:27:32.158
[HINDI - we should pay attention towards it
that everyone has told the same ultimate goal]

00:27:32.158 --> 00:27:35.586
[HINDI - How many times we may move in a
roundabout manner but we have to reach there]

00:27:35.606 --> 00:27:39.185
[HINDI - and everybody has made a
mental understanding of it.]

00:27:42.095 --> 00:27:47.535
[HINDI - You will not get to it by this. Adi
Shankaracharya has also said that,]

00:27:47.535 --> 00:27:53.199
[HINDI - mental analysis of this is not
required. Now in Sahaja yoga we believe]

00:27:53.199 --> 00:27:59.502
[HINDI - that Lord Buddha, who talked about
the formless - He didn't talk about God at all]

00:27:59.502 --> 00:28:03.476
[HINDI - because He thought, if there is talk
about God, these people will just think about it]

00:28:04.433 --> 00:28:09.263
[HINDI - they will not think about themselves.
By talk of God they think of themselves as Gods -]

00:28:09.263 --> 00:28:14.533
[HINDI - there are many like this. They
think they have become completely formless]

00:28:15.033 --> 00:28:21.213
[HINDI - Many think they have become God. Man's
brain is such that it sticks to what is told]

00:28:22.185 --> 00:28:31.765
[HINDI - and doesn't become what it really
is, the Spirit. Then, when the nature of man]

00:28:31.765 --> 00:28:36.437
[HINDI - is such that he sticks to this or
that, then Buddha also said that it's better]

00:28:36.437 --> 00:28:41.144
[HINDI - not to talk about God otherwise they
put God in their pockets and when required]

00:28:41.144 --> 00:28:44.647
[HINDI - took Him out of the pocket and
said, "See God, You have to do this work."]

00:28:44.647 --> 00:28:53.081
[HINDI - Now which God it is, only God knows.
When in His one life He didn't talk of God]

00:28:53.727 --> 00:28:57.317
[HINDI - and He said now only believe
in the formless, leave others.]

00:28:57.317 --> 00:29:03.353
[HINDI - Buddha followers also made a joke
out of Realization, then He only again came]

00:29:03.353 --> 00:29:08.468
[HINDI - to this world as Adi Shankaracharya
and He said that, "Now serve The Mother only]

00:29:08.468 --> 00:29:13.496
[HINDI - there is no other way out. You will
receive only after worshiping the Mother."]

00:29:13.496 --> 00:29:18.461
[HINDI - Because He had to say this since it
remained incomplete, so He told the other thing]

00:29:18.937 --> 00:29:23.867
[HINDI - When He started talking about
God, people also troubled Him.]

00:29:23.867 --> 00:29:28.782
[HINDI - Even when his mother died, people
didn't allow him to burn her, then He cremated]

00:29:28.782 --> 00:29:34.796
[HINDI - his mother using banana leaves.
In this manner such, so said clever people,]

00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:44.899
[HINDI - came to (UNCLEAR). Now the world
has changed some what that no one does]

00:29:44.899 --> 00:29:48.776
[HINDI - such extreme behavior with Me.
One or two may get annoyed and angry but]

00:29:48.776 --> 00:29:54.733
[HINDI - no one has shown such extremeness
that they come and hit Me, this is not the situation]

00:29:55.838 --> 00:30:02.467
[HINDI - Because of this I feel obliged to all
those Great people, who made you understand]

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:09.303
[HINDI - through interchanging that 'Not this, not
this'(Sanskrit saying - Ya neti, neti vachne nigmo)]

00:30:09.303 --> 00:30:15.849
[HINDI - Not this, not this, not this, then what?
When you start negating something, then]

00:30:15.849 --> 00:30:19.904
[HINDI - ultimately you get to the right
thing that's why they told you all about]

00:30:19.904 --> 00:30:23.786
[HINDI - first the Form and then the Formless,
then from the Formless to Form, keep on moving]

00:30:25.239 --> 00:30:32.889
[HINDI - When a person will be tired of all this,
then he will think seriously, then what is it?]

00:30:34.525 --> 00:30:38.445
[HINDI - So I told you about the Formless
(Nirakaar), is the All Pervading Power]

00:30:38.445 --> 00:30:42.699
[HINDI - (Brahm Shakti) which is all
around us and you are the Form(Sakaar)]

00:30:44.469 --> 00:30:54.239
[HINDI - and at the time of every evolution, one
Deity has been placed within you at every step]

00:30:54.812 --> 00:31:01.322
[HINDI - When you came to this world in the
form of Carbon, then Shri Ganesha was seated]

00:31:02.864 --> 00:31:08.594
[HINDI - Carbon also has four valencies -
He sits right in the center. There can be]

00:31:08.594 --> 00:31:16.299
[HINDI - no life in the world without Carbon
- a being cannot be made. Thus, first thing]

00:31:16.299 --> 00:31:23.258
[HINDI - Carbon was made and Shri Ganesh
was the One who started all this, that's]

00:31:23.258 --> 00:31:26.752
[HINDI - why it is said that Shri Ganesh
is made from the Earth element]

00:31:27.228 --> 00:31:31.028
[HINDI - Now He was the first One to
be seated, Who is the symbol of purity]

00:31:31.643 --> 00:31:36.433
[HINDI - In no religion has it been said that
by being unholy, you will become religious]

00:31:36.433 --> 00:31:41.004
[HINDI - Leave alone the modern gurus - God
save from these people - they teach all]

00:31:41.004 --> 00:31:48.727
[HINDI - wrong things. In no religion has it been
said that if you do bad deeds, can you get to God]

00:31:52.306 --> 00:32:00.386
[HINDI - But, if we see this, that in all
religions the same thing has been said]

00:32:01.402 --> 00:32:06.342
[HINDI - and everyone believes that chastity
is a constant and steady feeling of life]

00:32:06.674 --> 00:32:13.514
[HINDI - which should be held on to, then
we have to believe that God Almighty]

00:32:13.514 --> 00:32:21.459
[HINDI - established Shri Ganesh in the first
place. He is the indication, as here we say]

00:32:21.459 --> 00:32:32.856
[HINDI - and which you can understand,
(ASIDE - What do we say to symbol in English?)

00:32:34.241 --> 00:32:48.291
[HINDI - Yes, indication. Lord Ganesh
symbolizes purity and chastity.]

00:32:48.291 --> 00:32:52.253
[HINDI - Innocence, He is the symbol of
innocence, simplicity]

00:32:52.253 --> 00:32:57.454
[HINDI - Lord Shiva has filled His
son with His innocence]

00:32:57.454 --> 00:33:02.557
[HINDI - and the person who is most innocent
is the most powerful. The most powerful God]

00:33:02.557 --> 00:33:09.802
[HINDI - is Shri Ganesha, means the person
who is most innocent is the most powerful]

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:15.630
[HINDI - and nowadays nobody believes
that innocence is also something.]

00:33:16.314 --> 00:33:24.164
[HINDI - So, Shri Ganesha was placed on
the first chakra. Now Nanak sahab or]

00:33:24.164 --> 00:33:42.554
[HINDI - Kabirdas also believed that we have
Kundalini power within us. And many of the]

00:33:42.554 --> 00:33:54.906
[HINDI - sections of Namdeva etc in Guru
Granth Sahib used to believe in Vitthal]

00:33:58.265 --> 00:34:08.025
[HINDI - Then we must understand, that all
those people saw God Almighty in two forms]

00:34:08.025 --> 00:34:13.100
[HINDI - Formless as well as of the Form;
Some talked more of the Formless,]

00:34:13.100 --> 00:34:16.728
[HINDI - whilst the other of the
Form, as was the time.]

00:34:21.257 --> 00:34:27.687
[HINDI -So They seated Shri Ganesh on the
first Chakra, which means our first chakra]

00:34:27.687 --> 00:34:32.712
[HINDI - is that of purity. If you want to
understand in the Formless, it is purity]

00:34:32.712 --> 00:34:41.681
[HINDI - and in the form is Shri Ganesh.
The place or seat of Kundalini is above]

00:34:41.681 --> 00:34:45.369
[HINDI - this chakra; This is some thing
to be understood, it's a very big thing]

00:34:45.369 --> 00:34:58.803
[HINDI - Kundalini is above this chakra, not
below it. Because this purity or Shri Ganesh]

00:34:58.803 --> 00:35:10.663
[HINDI - takes care of and protects the chastity
of His mother Gauri, who is pure like a virgin girl]

00:35:11.603 --> 00:35:19.345
[HINDI - and is sitting below Her watching
everyone and conveys the information of]

00:35:19.345 --> 00:35:35.458
[HINDI - whatever we do to the Kundalini,
who is sitting like a tape-recorder]

00:35:35.458 --> 00:35:47.064
[HINDI - and recording everything. Now what
is this Kundalini? It is the Primordial Desire,]

00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:57.010
[HINDI - Primordial desire of God Almighty.
His first desire was to create the Nature]

00:36:01.627 --> 00:36:10.787
[HINDI - and this Nature should know
Me, recognize Me, be one with Me -]

00:36:11.090 --> 00:36:21.980
[HINDI - this is His Primordial Desire and
that very Desire, whom we know as Adishakti,]

00:36:24.063 --> 00:36:35.113
[HINDI - the English people know as Holy
Ghost and which is called 'Ee' in the Vedas]

00:36:37.067 --> 00:36:45.777
[HINDI - and which Nanak Sahab has called the
First Mother(Adhya). This Primordial Desire took a]

00:36:45.777 --> 00:36:52.985
[HINDI - Form and created the whole Nature
and seated Shri Ganesh and Form of Gauri]

00:36:52.985 --> 00:36:58.844
[HINDI - the Kundalini within us, which is called a
virgin because it is extremely pure like a small girl.]

00:36:59.158 --> 00:37:03.808
[HINDI - And there is just one Pure Desire
in a human being - rest all are impure.]

00:37:03.808 --> 00:37:10.655
[HINDI - There is just one Pure Desire, rest are
all impure means there is just one virgin desire]

00:37:11.729 --> 00:37:16.649
[HINDI - Virgin means, like virgin land 
- that which has not been used as yet;]

00:37:16.875 --> 00:37:23.475
[HINDI - The land which we have not dug up
yet, is virgin land. Then this extremely]

00:37:23.475 --> 00:37:32.386
[HINDI - Pure Desire(virgin desire) is just
one within us. That is, we should know]

00:37:32.386 --> 00:37:39.975
[HINDI - that God Almighty who has created
us. After Self-realization we know that]

00:37:39.975 --> 00:37:46.429
[HINDI - God Almighty, this Pure Desire is
sitting within us in the form of Kundalini]

00:37:47.175 --> 00:37:59.415
[HINDI - Since this Kundalini has not been
awakened, thus it is called dormant stage]

00:37:59.415 --> 00:38:06.594
[HINDI - means, it is sleeping. When it is
executed or implemented, then it can be]

00:38:06.594 --> 00:38:14.622
[HINDI - said that it has evolved or it has
germinated, just like a seed germinates]

00:38:21.973 --> 00:38:33.123
[HINDI - Now, after the sixth century 
many bad people took birth in our country]

00:38:33.123 --> 00:38:39.554
[HINDI - and did extreme behavior and wrong
things and whom we know as Tantrikas]

00:38:40.181 --> 00:38:52.801
[HINDI - Having the heart of a Mother, I can't say
they're totally bad, a small part is still left out]

00:38:52.801 --> 00:39:05.657
[HINDI - That's why I think that, maybe, when they
were focusing on this first chakra which deals]

00:39:05.657 --> 00:39:18.515
[HINDI - with excretion also, they must
have seen the trunk of Shri Ganesh and]

00:39:18.515 --> 00:39:23.683
[HINDI - must have thought that Kundalini
is in this Mooladhar chakra.]

00:39:24.262 --> 00:39:31.652
[HINDI - But Kundalini is sitting in the
Mooladhar, that is the Mooladhar and this]

00:39:31.652 --> 00:39:37.154
[HINDI - is the Mooladhar chakra - this is
the difference and only this chakra is]

00:39:37.154 --> 00:39:42.259
[HINDI - outside, rest all the chakras are
inside the spinal cord or are in the]

00:39:42.259 --> 00:39:53.225
[HINDI - brain, inside the skull of the
brain and only this chakra is outside]

00:39:53.225 --> 00:40:08.339
[HINDI - and it moves or works out the pelvic
plexus. By this, it should be known to us]

00:40:08.339 --> 00:40:16.828
[HINDI - that the Kundalini pierces only six
chakras not seven - this is a very important fact]

00:40:17.838 --> 00:40:25.368
[HINDI - This means that the act of excretion,
means sex and other things excreted,]

00:40:25.744 --> 00:40:33.864
[HINDI - are not responsible for our
evolution, they have no effect on it]

00:40:34.902 --> 00:40:43.252
[HINDI - But dharma has an effect on evolution.
Whatever is done immorally has a bad effect]

00:40:45.524 --> 00:40:56.054
[HINDI - Whatever is done in dharma, is
not wrong and that's why this chakra]

00:40:56.054 --> 00:41:11.060
[HINDI - looks after our purity and chastity and
Ganeshji is an Eternal child because He's innocent]

00:41:11.853 --> 00:41:19.473
[HINDI - that's why all the impurities,
evils and abhorrence don't touch him,]

00:41:19.473 --> 00:41:25.900
[HINDI - He remains aloof; He's verily Onkar.
If a diamond is thrown anywhere, it still]

00:41:25.900 --> 00:41:31.890
[HINDI - remains a diamond - verily the
symbol of Onkar - nobody can touch Him]

00:41:33.330 --> 00:41:42.280
[HINDI - and that's why He's sitting there,
taking care of all the purity that is within us]

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:47.376
[HINDI - A human thinks that, "Mother, You say
like this but there are so many immoral people]

00:41:47.376 --> 00:41:53.211
[HINDI - in the world and nothing happens to
them, they never get sick, are never in pain]

00:41:53.211 --> 00:41:58.120
[HINDI - and do much wickedness and are
still very happy." This is not the thing.]

00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:05.776
[HINDI - Every chakra has its defect. Now
this chakra is so important - the person]

00:42:05.776 --> 00:42:15.080
[HINDI - who's this chakra is defective, if
any other chakra ia affected, then he may]

00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:21.139
[HINDI - get a very nasty disease like
mellitus. Many cancer diseases can also]

00:42:21.139 --> 00:42:27.723
[HINDI - caught if this chakra is affected,
eye problems can also happen because of this,]

00:42:27.723 --> 00:42:32.883
[HINDI - problems of the intellect can be
there, and many types of disorders are]

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:38.540
[HINDI - caused by this chakra being
spoilt. Thus those people who say that]

00:42:38.540 --> 00:42:43.128
[HINDI - immorality doesn't matter, haven't
been able to make a connection between the two]

00:42:43.128 --> 00:42:46.948
[HINDI - They can't understand that their
problem is because of this. This only]

00:42:46.948 --> 00:42:51.729
[HINDI - you can understand after your
realization when you become a saint and]

00:42:51.729 --> 00:42:56.198
[HINDI - you are able to feel the vibrations
on your palms, then this formless will]

00:42:56.198 --> 00:43:01.285
[HINDI - speak to you on your hands, "See,
what is the problem with this person and]

00:43:01.285 --> 00:43:05.993
[HINDI - what he should rectify and you'll be
surprised that whichever chakra is indicated]

00:43:05.993 --> 00:43:10.860
[HINDI - that will be the problem of that
person." Mohammad Sahab has said that,]

00:43:10.860 --> 00:43:17.603
[HINDI - "When the time of resurrection will come,"
means today's time, "then your hands will speak."]

00:43:19.621 --> 00:43:24.701
[HINDI - By knowing the chakras on your hands,
you'll be able to tell the problem of that person]

00:43:24.701 --> 00:43:29.149
[HINDI - On the base of the palm is the
place(location) of the Mooladhar chakra]

00:43:31.711 --> 00:43:37.281
[HINDI - By the Grace of God you are sitting in the
land of yoga. Very great saints have been here]

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:43.812
[HINDI - Their feet have touched this land, this is
the land of yoga, howsoever much it is described,]

00:43:43.812 --> 00:43:48.293
[HINDI - it still falls short. Yesterday, I
don't know how many times, I stopped Myself]

00:43:48.293 --> 00:43:52.791
[HINDI - from describing it - didn't know
how to describe. The Kundalini of the]

00:43:52.791 --> 00:43:56.722
[HINDI - whole Universe is sitting here, in
Maharashtra. There are three and a half peethas]

00:43:56.722 --> 00:44:01.723
[HINDI - many people say that. If there are
three and a half peethas, what does it mean?

00:44:01.723 --> 00:44:04.906
[HINDI - It means that the three and a
half peethas of the Kundlini of the whole]

00:44:04.906 --> 00:44:09.326
[HINDI - Universe are in Maharashtra.
Asht-Vinayak are in Maharashtra - they've]

00:44:09.326 --> 00:44:16.194
[HINDI - surrounded from all eight sides,
made arrangements for purity]

00:44:17.514 --> 00:44:23.364
[HINDI - Asht-Vinayak and three and a half
peethas are in it, twenty eight places of the Devi,]

00:44:23.364 --> 00:44:29.181
[HINDI - everything has been arranged by
the Mother Earth. Jyotirling - all the]

00:44:29.181 --> 00:44:32.592
[HINDI - arrangements we find in this
country are nowhere to be found although]

00:44:32.592 --> 00:44:36.239
[HINDI - in England I have seen now that
some such stones have come out of the]

00:44:36.239 --> 00:44:39.986
[HINDI - Mother Earth which give vibrations
- they're called Stonehenge but they]

00:44:39.986 --> 00:44:44.808
[HINDI - themselves don't understand.
They didn't have any such Pirs, no such]

00:44:44.808 --> 00:44:55.165
[HINDI - Mahatmas or saints, who would say.
The Shiva who is in Mecca, the stone of Mecca]

00:44:55.165 --> 00:45:00.664
[HINDI - is also described in our Puranas
and is called Macceshwarshiv - you may see]

00:45:03.576 --> 00:45:11.306
[HINDI - Punja Sahab, which they took out,
is also the same thing. Chaitanya or vibration]

00:45:11.306 --> 00:45:20.850
[HINDI - comes from that place. See now,
the thing you have spread here, if you]

00:45:20.850 --> 00:45:25.290
[HINDI - show this to a saint or sadhu,
even after many years have passed, will]

00:45:25.290 --> 00:45:29.895
[HINDI - understand that a saint or sadhu
has sat on it. Whatever is touched is]

00:45:29.895 --> 00:45:39.106
[HINDI - filled up with vibrations. Last
time I told you that I went to Kashmir -]

00:45:39.715 --> 00:45:45.985
[HINDI - not here somewhere else - then all
of a sudden I felt that there's something]

00:45:45.985 --> 00:45:51.415
[HINDI - full of vibrations, then I told
the driver to stop there and ask whether]

00:45:51.415 --> 00:45:55.430
[HINDI - there was any temple etc nearby.
Then he said, "Mother how can a temple]

00:45:55.430 --> 00:45:59.242
[HINDI - be there, You are roaming in the
jungle?" Then I told My husband,]

00:45:59.242 --> 00:46:05.288
[HINDI - "Maybe within 4-5 miles radius there
should be something." Then I told him to]

00:46:05.288 --> 00:46:11.812
[HINDI - go by the way I asked him to. Then
we kept on moving and reached a place where]

00:46:11.812 --> 00:46:14.341
[HINDI - he said that it was a place where
the Muslims were dwelling so he said that]

00:46:14.341 --> 00:46:19.635
[HINDI - "We won't find anything here." I
told him to ask there at least. Then they]

00:46:19.635 --> 00:46:24.044
[HINDI - told that, "There is Hazrat Iqbal
here." One hair of Mohammad Sahab was]

00:46:24.044 --> 00:46:28.487
[HINDI - kept there and I could feel it
even at a distance of 5 miles. Now you]

00:46:28.487 --> 00:46:39.685
[HINDI - can say anything for Him, good
or bad, He is also ours, absolutely ours]

00:46:39.685 --> 00:46:44.519
[HINDI - this we should understand. There
is no difference between Him and Nanak Sahab]

00:46:44.519 --> 00:46:49.450
[HINDI - whether Hindu Muslims fight or cut
each other's necks, it will make no difference]

00:46:49.450 --> 00:46:56.684
[HINDI - whatever is the Truth I'm telling you.
We are fighting between ourselves uselessly.]

00:46:56.684 --> 00:47:03.738
[HINDI - All these are useless things, there
is nothing to fight. Today thousands of]

00:47:03.738 --> 00:47:09.248
[HINDI - Muslims have come to Sahaja yoga
because one Khomeni is standing before them]

00:47:09.248 --> 00:47:15.560
[HINDI - They say, "Lord, save us now we
don't want such a Muslim!" Because God]

00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:20.317
[HINDI - was merciful and they are so much
changed that they say, "Sahaja yoga is good."]

00:47:20.317 --> 00:47:24.855
[HINDI - They worship Shri Ganesh and they
will teach you what is the meaning of Shri Ganesh]

00:47:27.047 --> 00:47:33.117
[HINDI - Then in Sahaja yoga you will be able
to understand that whatever reality is there,]

00:47:33.139 --> 00:47:37.432
[HINDI - is within us, the Truth is within
us that you must understand and don't]

00:47:37.475 --> 00:47:45.645
[HINDI - gather any mental ideas and fight, please.
All of you are part and parcel of One God]

00:47:47.697 --> 00:47:52.717
[HINDI - You are part and parcel of the
Virata and Mohammad Sahab has also told]

00:47:52.717 --> 00:47:56.312
[HINDI - that when they put the fingers in
their ears and say, "Allah ho Akhbar"]

00:47:56.312 --> 00:47:59.632
[HINDI - this mantra we also say in Sahaja
yoga because these fingers(fore-fingers)]

00:47:59.632 --> 00:48:03.360
[HINDI - are of Vishuddhi chakra and by
putting the fingers in your ears what are]

00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:09.133
[HINDI - you saying, "Allah Ho Akhbar" means
what, that, Allah is, the Almighty God is Virata]

00:48:09.133 --> 00:48:13.392
[HINDI - Akhbar means Virata. The meaning
doesn't change with the change of language]

00:48:17.691 --> 00:48:22.031
[HINDI - And in this way you understand
that those things which have been proposed]

00:48:22.031 --> 00:48:29.135
[HINDI - since ages, since times immemorial,
which, if they are not totally and truthfully
enlightened]

00:48:29.135 --> 00:48:34.484
[HINDI - then even your children will run
away and say, "Save us from such a God,]

00:48:34.484 --> 00:48:39.718
[HINDI - we don't want, this is all a mental
projection. You all have no work so just]

00:48:39.718 --> 00:48:46.563
[HINDI - your mental upheaval." This can be
proved. Thus when the Kundalini is awakened]

00:48:47.571 --> 00:48:54.281
[HINDI - then the Kundalini doesn't rise in
totality. Just a part of it rises. The Kundalini]

00:48:54.281 --> 00:49:00.549
[HINDI - is like many, many strands twined
together - only a few of it's strands rise]

00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:05.951
[HINDI - through the Sushumna channel,
the central path, which is in the center.]

00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:18.980
[HINDI - And while rising from this channel,
whatever energy is filled up in it or used by it,]

00:49:19.221 --> 00:49:25.041
[HINDI - is provided by Shri Ganesha. Means
your chastity is a very important thing.]

00:49:25.041 --> 00:49:29.234
[HINDI - If a person is pure, then in a second
it will rise and reach from where to where]

00:49:29.620 --> 00:49:40.710
[HINDI - In a second. A person I know, is a very
great person. He was realized in a minute or two]

00:49:40.710 --> 00:49:45.218
[HINDI - I was amazed that his Kundalini
just jetted out and spread in the atmosphere]

00:49:45.218 --> 00:49:51.205
[HINDI - like this. He is a very pure person,
there is no doubt about it. As it is he was healthy]

00:49:51.205 --> 00:49:57.063
[HINDI - there were no hurdles as such, 
no complications, at once his Kundalini]

00:49:57.063 --> 00:50:01.469
[HINDI - jetted out and spread everywhere
and he felt strong vibrations on his palms]

00:50:03.212 --> 00:50:10.462
[HINDI - Many such people in our villages - I
mean, I have not worked in many villages here]

00:50:10.462 --> 00:50:15.262
[HINDI - but in Maharashtra villages thousands
of people have got their realization, thousands]

00:50:15.262 --> 00:50:21.704
[HINDI - and vibrations started flowing
strongly from their hands and all their]

00:50:21.704 --> 00:50:28.808
[HINDI - bad habits were broken by themselves
because the religion within them was awakened]

00:50:28.808 --> 00:50:32.758
[HINDI - Now those days are no more when
I should tell you not to do this or that]

00:50:34.271 --> 00:50:42.061
[HINDI - and a man catches more from the
outside, not from inside. Something or the other]

00:50:42.061 --> 00:50:47.395
[HINDI - is made on the outside in this
fashion, that we catch on to it. I have seen]

00:50:47.395 --> 00:50:52.144
[HINDI - in every religion, that we tend to
hold on to the outside more than the inside.]

00:50:54.353 --> 00:51:00.673
[HINDI - Now like in Muslim religion, drinking
is prohibited. Surely they will drink but offer]

00:51:00.673 --> 00:51:08.655
[HINDI - Namaz 5 times. Drinking is prohibited
in many religions and it's the right thing]

00:51:09.367 --> 00:51:15.407
[HINDI - It was prohibited because this
thing goes against our awareness.]

00:51:19.321 --> 00:51:25.281
[HINDI - Whatever goes against our awareness
should not be consumed because]

00:51:25.281 --> 00:51:28.723
[HINDI - we have to seek God only in our
awareness. But if you tell someone]

00:51:28.723 --> 00:51:31.510
[HINDI - not to drink alcohol then,
half the people will leave]

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:34.908
[HINDI - that's why I say, "No, no there's
no such thing, keep on sitting."]

00:51:34.917 --> 00:51:39.017
[HINDI - After realization, religion or
dharma will be awakened within them and]

00:51:39.017 --> 00:51:42.813
[HINDI - they themselves will not take
anything, why make them leave just now.]

00:51:43.079 --> 00:51:49.289
[HINDI - Everything bad leaves us because this
religion which is within us, placed in the center]

00:51:51.498 --> 00:51:57.458
[HINDI - has ten gurus in this place;
Principles or essences of ten gurus are there]

00:51:57.458 --> 00:52:07.655
[HINDI - They are there in their essences
as well as in form and all these gurus are]

00:52:07.655 --> 00:52:13.883
[HINDI - awakened within us and because of
their awakening religion is awakened in us]

00:52:13.883 --> 00:52:18.036
[HINDI - thus we can't do anything which
is against our innate religion, can't do -]

00:52:18.036 --> 00:52:24.146
[HINDI - is not digestible and is not digested.
You will be troubled if there's anything]

00:52:24.146 --> 00:52:27.827
[HINDI - against our religion, you
will run away from it.]

00:52:32.297 --> 00:52:37.477
[HINDI - And this happens by itself ]

00:52:37.477 --> 00:52:43.836
[HINDI - In order to be stabilized we have
to work a little hard but since it happens]

00:52:43.836 --> 00:52:48.638
[HINDI - by itself, religion is awakened
within a human-being. Nobody is to be told,]

00:52:48.638 --> 00:52:53.431
[HINDI - "Don't do such a thing, son," because
nowadays saying this nobody is going to listen]

00:52:53.431 --> 00:52:59.245
[HINDI - there will be real disaster. Everybody
is to be coaxed and told to sit down, it's alright.]

00:52:59.245 --> 00:53:03.614
[HINDI - "You drink alcohol, it's okay, other
things also you do, it's okay, sit down.]

00:53:03.614 --> 00:53:09.236
[HINDI - Whatever you do, no problem, all of you
sit down, first be realized, then we'll talk."]

00:53:09.311 --> 00:53:13.371
[HINDI - Then nobody feels bad but if
from the beginning we start saying,]

00:53:13.371 --> 00:53:20.535
[HINDI - "You can't drink alcohol or smoke
cigarettes," then people will be annoyed]

00:53:20.535 --> 00:53:25.454
[HINDI - Now Muslims say, that they have
not been told not to smoke. Cigarettes]

00:53:25.454 --> 00:53:29.097
[HINDI - were not there at that time, so
how could they be told not to smoke?]

00:53:29.097 --> 00:53:32.488
[HINDI - Then He came back as Nanak Sahab
and told them not to smoke cigarettes because]

00:53:32.488 --> 00:53:36.100
[HINDI - now they have taken out cigarettes.
Now, if tomorrow you all start having Hashish]

00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:41.649
[HINDI - then you'll say, "Nanak Sahab didn't
tell us not to have Hashish," so we can have it]

00:53:42.595 --> 00:53:52.255
[HINDI - So with such type of fugitives, God
only save us. That is, Kabirdas, who was such a]

00:53:52.255 --> 00:53:58.190
[HINDI - great person, wouldn't He think
how stupid or boorish these people are!]

00:53:58.190 --> 00:54:03.781
[HINDI - He spent his whole life in Bihar,
did so much work for our upliftment and]

00:54:03.781 --> 00:54:09.323
[HINDI - he has called Kundalini as Surti,
everywhere He's called Kundalini as Surti]

00:54:09.323 --> 00:54:18.670
[HINDI - now in Bihar, you'll be surprised, they
call tobacco as Surti. Do they have wisdom or not]

00:54:18.670 --> 00:54:24.127
[HINDI - that Kabirdas must be thinking,
"What idiots these people are! I've talked]

00:54:24.127 --> 00:54:27.441
[HINDI - about Kundalini as Surti and 
now what are they calling as Surti?"]

00:54:29.161 --> 00:54:34.981
[HINDI - And in our Maharashtra also, Shri
Krishna who is the Lord of the Vishuddhi,]

00:54:36.597 --> 00:54:41.537
[HINDI - His temple of Vitthala, where
it is said Vitthala actually was seated,]

00:54:42.534 --> 00:54:48.324
[HINDI - for going to that place, people
take something to play in their hands saying]

00:54:48.324 --> 00:54:54.123
[HINDI - 'Vitthala, Vitthala' and keep
tobacco in their mouths, the thing which]

00:54:54.123 --> 00:55:02.170
[HINDI - is absolutely detested by Shri
Krishna, hates it. Now that they have got]

00:55:02.170 --> 00:55:10.344
[HINDI - cancer, then it's good, they have
to leave themselves. And I'm more surprised]

00:55:10.344 --> 00:55:16.033
[HINDI - by the fact that - since childhood
I used to think, how is a man's brain.]

00:55:16.033 --> 00:55:24.412
[HINDI - When he sees that a person who's
returning from the pub badly drunk and]

00:55:24.412 --> 00:55:28.876
[HINDI - not in his senses, then why does he go to
the same pub himself when he is in his senses? ]

00:55:31.375 --> 00:55:39.075
[HINDI - But all these surprising things are only in
human beings, nothing amazes Me about God]

00:55:39.075 --> 00:55:43.713
[HINDI - because whatever He says, He does
and Whatever He is, He is. But man does]

00:55:43.713 --> 00:55:52.998
[HINDI - one thing, tells something and
speaks another. It is because all the chakras]

00:55:52.998 --> 00:55:58.673
[HINDI - are not integrated. The integration
that is required in all the centers, is not there]

00:55:58.673 --> 00:56:04.701
[HINDI - One chakra is separated from another.
If we tell about dharma, they will start lecturing]

00:56:04.701 --> 00:56:13.655
[HINDI - I met a person in Solapur, there
was a lecture. He said, "Mataji, a person]

00:56:13.655 --> 00:56:19.277
[HINDI - came to me like a babaji and said
that, "There is so much poverty in our]

00:56:19.277 --> 00:56:23.252
[HINDI - country that people eat sand also.'"
I said, "I have never seen such a thing."]

00:56:23.252 --> 00:56:28.489
[HINDI - Must be eating sand etc. "And you
rich people are like that, you all never]

00:56:28.489 --> 00:56:34.834
[HINDI - give any money. If you all give money,
I can help them." He arranged for himself.]

00:56:35.689 --> 00:56:41.239
[HINDI - And said, " While returning he went back
in an imported car. Couldn't understand anything."]

00:56:42.366 --> 00:56:47.196
[HINDI - So I said, "This is the characteristic
of you people that you will give money to such]

00:56:47.196 --> 00:56:54.099
[HINDI - a person who will tell you such 
tales, like they are really gods and does he]

00:56:54.099 --> 00:56:58.125
[HINDI - care anything about you? He's
just come to make money for himself."]

00:56:58.125 --> 00:57:02.566
[HINDI - When there are such wicked
people in our country, one person has]

00:57:02.566 --> 00:57:12.913
[HINDI - earned 6000 crores of 
rupees(koti) - this is their business]

00:57:13.726 --> 00:57:19.626
[HINDI - Now, who among us have given this
money? Must be idiots, that's why but]

00:57:19.626 --> 00:57:23.646
[HINDI - if so many stupid people are born
at one time, then it'll be very difficult.]

00:57:23.646 --> 00:57:29.249
[HINDI - If there are a few, it's okay.
And people like these type of persons]

00:57:29.277 --> 00:57:36.297
[HINDI - Till Sahaja yoga is awakened in you,
how will you know who's real and who's unreal,]

00:57:37.337 --> 00:57:41.967
[HINDI - who's a reality and who's fake, 
who's truthful and who's false?]

00:57:41.967 --> 00:57:46.749
[HINDI - Till there are vibrations in
your hands till then how will you say]

00:57:46.749 --> 00:57:54.906
[HINDI - who's truthful and who's false? 
Your own power has not been awakened as yet]

00:57:54.906 --> 00:58:01.380
[HINDI - You still don't have your lamp
within you, with what are you stumbling]

00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:09.450
[HINDI - in the darkness, you don't know. Thus,
first of all, you should get your Self-realization]

00:58:10.391 --> 00:58:14.331
[HINDI - then talk of other things, first
have the realization of your Spirit.]

00:58:14.331 --> 00:58:18.117
[HINDI - Get enlightened from the darkness
then, you'll be able to see all the]

00:58:18.117 --> 00:58:22.639
[HINDI - darkness within yourself, all the
stumbling blocks within you, all the faults within]

00:58:22.639 --> 00:58:29.643
[HINDI - and your Spirit is your own master,
your own guru, which from times immemorial]

00:58:29.643 --> 00:58:33.027
[HINDI - all the great masters have looked
after, taken care of and talked of]

00:58:33.027 --> 00:58:36.991
[HINDI - that same guru is within you,
it will teach and guide you,]

00:58:36.991 --> 00:58:41.467
[HINDI - "See, you are not this, you are
something else, leave this, leave this."]

00:58:42.345 --> 00:58:48.755
HINDI - That Spirit should be awakened,
whichever religion you believe into,]

00:58:49.355 --> 00:58:53.805
[HINDI - this belief is just also a product
of your brain - then you will have faith]

00:58:53.805 --> 00:58:57.219
[HINDI - in the religion of the Spirit,
that is the real religion. All the other]

00:58:57.219 --> 00:59:01.175
[HINDI - religions, have in a way, 
proved to be false, are now belied.]

00:59:02.130 --> 00:59:08.540
[HINDI - It started with truthfulness. So
many great people came in this world,]

00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:15.426
[HINDI - like many flowers bloom on the
tree, many a time, later on you people]

00:59:15.426 --> 00:59:23.001
[HINDI - plucked them, made them yours,
finished their essence in total. It is]

00:59:23.001 --> 00:59:28.674
[HINDI - no fault of theirs and no fault
of the religion as well. These are all]

00:59:28.674 --> 00:59:35.056
[HINDI - your doings by which these faults
occurred. Now, I have thought of only one]

00:59:35.056 --> 00:59:39.899
[HINDI - way to awaken you, first awaken
your Spirit, then will talk of other things.]

00:59:39.899 --> 00:59:45.527
[HINDI - Whatever it is, howsoever a person
is, come, first get realized. Get your realization]

00:59:45.527 --> 00:59:55.215
[HINDI - first, after that I will see you. Without
re-birth a person can't understand this thing]

00:59:55.215 --> 01:00:02.903
[HINDI - Everything just becomes verbal
talk, talk and religion also becomes that]

01:00:02.903 --> 01:00:07.411
[HINDI - When this dharma is awakened, the
foreigners who are sitting here, all what]

01:00:07.411 --> 01:00:13.453
[HINDI - they have been doing, howsoever
we may try, we can never do because they]

01:00:13.453 --> 01:00:18.163
[HINDI - think that following a dharma is
wrong, it's great to leave it. Their one]

01:00:18.163 --> 01:00:23.224
[HINDI - teacher, Freud taught them this only.
They were taught that it's a sin to believe in]

01:00:23.224 --> 01:00:27.392
[HINDI - relations like mother or sister and
they followed it, thinking it to be true]

01:00:27.392 --> 01:00:32.167
[HINDI - Now they have left all this and
bloomed like a lotus. They've changed fully,]

01:00:32.167 --> 01:00:35.165
[HINDI - their life has changed and 
they've become so beautiful.]

01:00:38.353 --> 01:00:44.493
[HINDI - But an Indian leaves all this with
great difficulty. He's more stuck to it]

01:00:45.185 --> 01:00:51.185
[HINDI - because all this has been here
since ages. If a good thing is stuck to us,]

01:00:51.699 --> 01:00:57.899
[HINDI - it's very beautiful but bad things
are more stuck to us, that's why they're]

01:00:57.899 --> 01:01:03.482
[HINDI - more difficult to give up but we
have to let go of them because if we don't]

01:01:03.482 --> 01:01:10.289
[HINDI - leave them, our vibrations will
be no more. We can't be established.]

01:01:13.486 --> 01:01:17.987
[HINDI - Now you have a third chakra 
within you, which is actually considered]

01:01:17.987 --> 01:01:28.907
[HINDI - second, called Swadhishthan chakra.
This chakra gives us the power of Brahmadeva]

01:01:28.907 --> 01:01:33.764
[HINDI - because of which a person has
thoughts, starts thinking, thinking about]

01:01:33.764 --> 01:01:39.001
[HINDI - what's going to come. He creates some
thing, for example, you make some furniture.]

01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:45.380
[HINDI - If a tree is broken, person thinks
of making some furniture. Previously, I think]

01:01:45.380 --> 01:01:48.275
[HINDI - furniture would have been made
for very old people because they couldn't]

01:01:48.275 --> 01:01:50.860
[HINDI - sit on the ground. Doing all
this, the young people thought of making]

01:01:50.860 --> 01:01:53.677
[HINDI - making furniture for themselves
also. In this process, the furniture sat]

01:01:53.677 --> 01:01:59.024
[HINDI - on our heads, now we can't sit on the
ground, we have to move with a chair alongside.]

01:02:00.267 --> 01:02:11.397
[HINDI - By this power a person creates
and when we use]

01:02:11.397 --> 01:02:14.546
[HINDI - this power of creativity too much,
more than is required]

01:02:16.843 --> 01:02:20.510
[ASIDE - MARATHI]

01:02:25.393 --> 01:02:32.973
[HINDI - when we use this power in excess,
then, due to excessive use of this power,]

01:02:32.973 --> 01:02:40.966
[HINDI - our connection with the other
chakras breaks. This happens with a person]

01:02:40.966 --> 01:02:48.895
[HINDI - leading a lonely life and when 
our connection with the Whole is broken,]

01:02:48.895 --> 01:02:56.220
[HINDI - then we start moving in our own
ways - on my own and this only we can say]

01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:04.267
[HINDI - that a person is affected by the
disease of Cancer. If he doesn't have]

01:03:04.267 --> 01:03:10.404
[HINDI - cancer of the body, it can be of the mind
also. All the egoists have cancer of the mind]

01:03:10.404 --> 01:03:14.125
[HINDI - because they think there's no one
greater in the world than them and those]

01:03:14.125 --> 01:03:16.939
[HINDI - who come in contact with them,
also start thinking the same. If they step into]

01:03:16.939 --> 01:03:19.604
[HINDI - someone's house, the children
will also start thinking like them.]

01:03:19.604 --> 01:03:22.147
[HINDI - Such is their blessing, that as
soon as they start talking even the]

01:03:22.147 --> 01:03:31.760
[HINDI - horses, ox etc start behaving like
them. Whoever sees an egoist, starts being one]

01:03:32.291 --> 01:03:36.905
[HINDI - Now Hitler is an example of that.
He was so filled up with ego that he]

01:03:36.905 --> 01:03:40.631
[HINDI - started thinking himself to be a
special person, whomsoever he came in]

01:03:40.631 --> 01:03:43.275
[HINDI - contact with also started thinking
the same. He killed so many people,]

01:03:43.275 --> 01:03:48.821
[HINDI - worsened their condition, nobody
could understand this, he fooled millions]

01:03:48.821 --> 01:03:53.812
[HINDI - and everybody foolishly listened to
him and he killed very small children and]

01:03:53.812 --> 01:03:56.645
[HINDI - women in the gas chamber
and they couldn't understand.]

01:03:58.607 --> 01:04:04.697
[HINDI - So those, who think they are
very clever, have Hitler before them.]

01:04:04.697 --> 01:04:08.802
[HINDI - Then there is Mr. Khomeni, Idi
Amin and many others you can see.]

01:04:11.170 --> 01:04:18.420
[HINDI - And the person who has ego - which
is shown above here, you may see, like]

01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:25.974
[HINDI - bile of yellow color, is ego - is
because of the working of Swadhishthan chakra]

01:04:26.168 --> 01:04:32.208
[HINDI - and it gets it's power from
the right side power of Saraswati.]

01:04:36.257 --> 01:04:42.467
[HINDI - Now the person, who gets the power
of Saraswati, thinks himself to be very wise]

01:04:43.335 --> 01:04:55.455
[HINDI - and uses it so much, that like
a by product this ego develops. Just like]

01:04:55.455 --> 01:04:59.947
[HINDI - if a factory is overrun, there's lot of
smoke in the same way, ego develops within us]

01:04:59.947 --> 01:05:06.723
[HINDI - And the symptom of ego, you'll be
surprised, is idiotism. A person who is an egoist]

01:05:06.723 --> 01:05:13.676
[HINDI - is extremely an idiot, his talks are
entirely stupid, idiotic - he is big idiot.]

01:05:14.381 --> 01:05:20.151
[HINDI - If some person tells you, "I came
first, first class first and I'm such and such]

01:05:20.151 --> 01:05:23.025
[HINDI - and I'm the king of this place,"
then you can tell him,]

01:05:23.025 --> 01:05:26.772
[HINDI - "I'm a poor person please forgive
me, why did you come here."]

01:05:28.002 --> 01:05:36.712
[HINDI - You must have read here, once Naradji
became arrogant and what stupidity he did]

01:05:37.553 --> 01:05:45.283
[HINDI - and he went to Mayanagri, became a
monkey and behaved stupidly doing foolish acts]

01:05:45.283 --> 01:05:53.577
[HINDI - All the people laugh behind the
backs of such idiots. You may see that]

01:05:53.577 --> 01:06:00.175
[HINDI - when people talk about arrogant people,
they make fun of them and laugh mockingly]

01:06:00.175 --> 01:06:05.073
[HINDI - "This stupid arrogant person
thinks himself to be something great]

01:06:05.073 --> 01:06:11.725
[HINDI - but he's entirely an egoist," and
this arrogance takes a person towards stupidity]

01:06:11.725 --> 01:06:15.026
[HINDI - and he become more and more foolish
but doesn't understand that he's an idiot.]

01:06:15.026 --> 01:06:25.643
[HINDI - In the end his heart also is compressed,
his heart stops because this ego - the heart chakra]

01:06:25.643 --> 01:06:33.990
[HINDI - this Brahmarandhra is the peetha
of the heart and it covers that and when]

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:40.112
[HINDI - ego envelops it, our heart is entirely
compressed and when the heart becomes like]

01:06:40.112 --> 01:06:49.594
[HINDI - this then he becomes one with evil
nature that you're surprised how he's so evil?]

01:06:49.773 --> 01:06:54.843
[HINDI - Now when we go abroad - I don't
know how our Indians go and live there -]

01:06:54.843 --> 01:06:59.589
[HINDI - I feel as if My exile has begun.
It is said that in London city,]

01:06:59.589 --> 01:07:05.265
[HINDI - every week two people are killed
and who are they? They are small children]

01:07:05.265 --> 01:07:08.632
[HINDI - and the persons killing them are
their parents. Just think, can anybody]

01:07:08.632 --> 01:07:14.122
[HINDI - even hear of such a thing? This is
done by arrogant people. It is their ego]

01:07:14.122 --> 01:07:19.473
[HINDI - only that they have no feeling
towards children or their mother or father]

01:07:20.252 --> 01:07:25.962
[HINDI - When a person is so enveloped
in his ego, then his idiocity is apparent]

01:07:25.962 --> 01:07:30.714
[HINDI - through his actions. We've had
so many great kings and emperors and many]

01:07:30.714 --> 01:07:35.308
[HINDI - big people but how humble they
were. Listen to a tale of Shivaji Maharaj]

01:07:35.308 --> 01:07:40.954
[HINDI - We've had people like Shivaji Maharaj
but now it feels that those were different times.]

01:07:40.954 --> 01:07:46.608
[HINDI - Ramdas Swami came to his house - he
was his guru and he called out from outside,]

01:07:48.393 --> 01:07:56.083
[HINDI - then Shivaji went and touched his
feet. He kept his crown on his feet and said,]

01:07:56.083 --> 01:08:00.843
[HINDI - "Guru Maharaj, how have you been
kind enough to be here?" His guru replied,]

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.891
[HINDI - "I have come to ask for alms." So
Shivaji went inside and wrote a letter]

01:08:03.891 --> 01:08:09.671
[HINDI - in which he wrote, "Guru Maharaj,
my whole kingdom is at your feet," came]

01:08:09.671 --> 01:08:15.068
[HINDI - and gave it to him in a moment, "You take
my whole Kingdom, everything is at your feet."

01:08:15.068 --> 01:08:19.637
[HINDI - The kings and emperors of today will
ask the saints and sadhus to stand outside only.]

01:08:19.637 --> 01:08:24.578
[HINDI - Will anybody ask them to come
inside also? Even if you go for some work]

01:08:24.578 --> 01:08:30.571
[HINDI - to a government servant, he will
make you sit down in the office with the peon]

01:08:30.571 --> 01:08:36.495
[HINDI - for hours. "Oh, I've a small work and you
are the government officer here, we have]

01:08:36.495 --> 01:08:43.336
[HINDI - some work of Sahaja yog, we don't take
any money, you please take this much from us."]

01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:50.180
[HINDI - Then he'll say, "You go and sit in that
corner just now." Will anyone even listen to you?]

01:08:50.329 --> 01:09:00.009
[HINDI - And here, the king himself offered
his whole kingdom to his guru and after]

01:09:00.009 --> 01:09:08.916
[HINDI - offering his kingdom, he said that, "Now I
have renounced everything." So his guru said]

01:09:08.916 --> 01:09:15.165
[HINDI - "Oh, but I am a saint, what will
I reign? Only you Kshatriyas have to rule]

01:09:15.165 --> 01:09:20.206
[HINDI - but the thing is that since you
have offered me, then symbolically, the]

01:09:20.206 --> 01:09:26.017
[HINDI - cloth I wear on my chest, you
make a flag of it." That flag was made.]

01:09:26.017 --> 01:09:31.805
[HINDI - Now I see, that flag is used in politics
nowadays. Arre, that flag is the characteristic]

01:09:31.805 --> 01:09:40.173
[HINDI - of hermits, leave it, at least leave
that. In this way we are spoiling everything.]

01:09:40.173 --> 01:09:50.203
[HINDI - Nobody's mind works properly and
when we flow in this foolishness, in this ego]

01:09:50.663 --> 01:09:56.603
[HINDI - then we don't come to know where
we are going to. But now, those countries]

01:09:56.603 --> 01:10:01.723
[HINDI - which have gone too far and those
who have made atom bombs and other bombs]

01:10:01.723 --> 01:10:06.681
[HINDI - and have made all preparations to
destroy themselves, they are awakened all]

01:10:06.681 --> 01:10:10.694
[HINDI - of a sudden, "Oh, my God! What devils
we have gathered which will destroy us!"]

01:10:10.819 --> 01:10:14.289
[HINDI - If America presses a button,
Russia is finished and if Russia presses]

01:10:14.289 --> 01:10:19.780
[HINDI - a button, the other one is." When the case
comes to a competition, then it goes in their heads,]

01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:25.810
[HINDI - "What sort of advancement have we
done because there is no emotional feeling!"]

01:10:25.810 --> 01:10:30.020
[HINDI - When there is no Spirit in a
thing, this is what will happen. Anything]

01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:34.325
[HINDI - you may do without the Spirit,
whether it is politics or it can be anything]

01:10:34.325 --> 01:10:41.075
[HINDI - Anything without the Spirit is destructible
and will be destroyed and will destroy.]

01:10:41.075 --> 01:10:46.791
[HINDI - Will never be correct. Now you all
are also becoming developing. Means nowadays]

01:10:46.791 --> 01:10:50.223
[HINDI - you are developing, tomorrow you
will be developed, then it will be the]

01:10:50.223 --> 01:10:53.333
[HINDI - same style that tomorrow your
children will become hippies and you will]

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:59.998
[HINDI - kill 2-4 children daily, with husband
wife fighting daily, then divorces after that,]

01:10:59.998 --> 01:11:05.741
[HINDI - all will go and live in the orphanages
and drink alcohol, that's all, no other]

01:11:05.741 --> 01:11:10.500
[HINDI - business left any longer. If you
are doing this arrangement, then I would]

01:11:10.500 --> 01:11:17.270
[HINDI - like to take leave from here. But, you
should know that, it's a very horrible thing,]

01:11:17.591 --> 01:11:22.071
[HINDI - we should refrain from this, it's
very terrible and in order to save yourself]

01:11:22.071 --> 01:11:26.431
[HINDI - from this, get to the Spirit first.
Then you may do developing or anything else]

01:11:26.431 --> 01:11:30.306
[HINDI - First realize your Spirit otherwise you
will be entangled in this complete destruction.]

01:11:30.503 --> 01:11:38.563
[HINDI - Thus don't go on the wrong path
due to any reason whatsoever. Now suppose, if]

01:11:38.563 --> 01:11:42.419
[HINDI - there's a person who's a journalist,
came and sat down and started fighting with Me]

01:11:42.419 --> 01:11:46.311
[HINDI - I said, "Why are you fighting
with Me, what wrong have I done to you?"]

01:11:46.311 --> 01:11:52.258
[HINDI - He said, "No, Mother, the thing is
You are saying now everything will be fine."]

01:11:52.258 --> 01:11:57.736
[HINDI - I said, "Yes, it will be. If dharma
is awakened and the Spirit is awakened,]

01:11:57.736 --> 01:12:01.483
[HINDI - then, all will be well." Then he said,
"Then what will we write in the newspapers?]

01:12:01.819 --> 01:12:06.259
[HINDI - We publish only those things in the
newspaper when there's anything wrong.]

01:12:06.259 --> 01:12:09.925
[HINDI - If an aeroplane crashes, somebody
dies, a number of people are injured,]

01:12:09.925 --> 01:12:13.046
[HINDI - all that we publish, then what
will we publish? The whole world is moving]

01:12:13.046 --> 01:12:17.599
[HINDI - in the opposite direction." Then I
said, "But also sometimes you must be a human,]

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:21.847
[HINDI - sometimes you must be a person
also or you are always a journalist?]

01:12:21.938 --> 01:12:25.608
[HINDI - And when you must be thinking
as a person, you must also be thinking]

01:12:25.608 --> 01:12:29.199
[HINDI - what's going on with your other
brothers and sisters, what's happening?]

01:12:29.845 --> 01:12:34.985
[HINDI - And what's happening to your
human being, think about it and come here."]

01:12:35.048 --> 01:12:40.168
[HINDI - He said, "Yes Mother, that it is.
There's much predicament in my own home."]

01:12:40.168 --> 01:12:43.998
[HINDI - "And in your society?" "There's
much more misery." "And in your country?"]

01:12:43.998 --> 01:12:48.626
[HINDI - "There a lot of plight in it." And
the whole world is in a mess and if this]

01:12:48.626 --> 01:12:53.337
[HINDI - has to be corrected then you have to get
to your Spirit. Tell everyone, "Get to your Spirit."]

01:12:53.337 --> 01:12:58.482
[HINDI - As soon as you realize your Spirit,
The power or light of God Almighty, which is]

01:12:58.482 --> 01:13:03.445
[HINDI - invisible and of which we are not
aware, will start flowing from within,]

01:13:03.445 --> 01:13:11.740
[HINDI - we will be in it's bondage, start
flowing in It's love and joy - we should get to it]

01:13:11.740 --> 01:13:19.618
[HINDI - Without realizing that, nothing will
be resolved. Today, if I talk on all the chakras,]

01:13:19.618 --> 01:13:23.660
[HINDI - it will be quite difficult but 
today I have told something about the]

01:13:23.660 --> 01:13:29.999
[HINDI - Swadhishthan and Mooladhar and
have spoken a little about the Guru principle.]

01:13:29.999 --> 01:13:35.906
[HINDI - Awakening the Guru principle
within us, is our prime duty. After awakening]

01:13:35.906 --> 01:13:42.002
[HINDI - that Guru Principle, you will
bring yourself on the right path.]

01:13:42.031 --> 01:13:47.431
[HINDI - Today the world is standing at
such a point, that destruction is evident]

01:13:47.431 --> 01:13:52.146
[HINDI - from the outside but a lot also
from within. All kinds of diseases]

01:13:52.146 --> 01:13:57.013
[HINDI - are now standing before us.
There is no cure for these diseases.]

01:13:57.175 --> 01:14:03.785
[HINDI - The destruction that is happening from
within, how we are perishing from within]

01:14:03.785 --> 01:14:11.416
[HINDI - we are not paying any attention in
that direction. Our families, whoever are ours]

01:14:11.416 --> 01:14:16.600
[HINDI - are finishing off. The only one
way to connect all of them is that, we]

01:14:16.600 --> 01:14:23.047
[HINDI - should receive the All-Pervading
Power of God Almighty. We should rise to]

01:14:23.047 --> 01:14:28.529
[HINDI - the Kingdom of God Almighty and
be united with Him and this can happen]

01:14:28.529 --> 01:14:36.167
[HINDI - only by Self-realization, which you
cannot sell or buy - this is absolutely wrong]

01:14:36.167 --> 01:14:42.198
[HINDI - that many people say, "How can it
work without money?" How much money do]

01:14:42.198 --> 01:14:46.679
[HINDI - you pay for the air you breathe?
Taking it in, free. In becoming a]

01:14:46.679 --> 01:14:51.017
[HINDI - human being from amoeba,
how much money did you offer to God?]

01:14:52.002 --> 01:15:00.042
[HINDI - All that is valuable and necessary things
for life are all free that's why we are alive]

01:15:00.042 --> 01:15:05.718
[HINDI - otherwise the way we are, sometimes it
feels, we even don't have the right to be alive.]

01:15:05.718 --> 01:15:11.436
[HINDI - But God Almighty has given us everything
free. His unconventional extreme compassion,]

01:15:11.436 --> 01:15:16.049
[HINDI - His love is flowing in the whole
world that's why we all are still there.]

01:15:16.049 --> 01:15:22.873
[HINDI - We have only to instill His love within
us and spread it's Light in the whole world]

01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:27.590
[HINDI - Our programs regarding the
Kundalaini are there for another ten days]

01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:33.482
[HINDI - You make sure to attend them and
I will tell further about it, that what]

01:15:33.482 --> 01:15:40.028
[HINDI - is the Kundalini, how much it is
eternally related to us and the properties]

01:15:40.028 --> 01:15:47.025
[HINDI - of the Eternal religion are extremely
necessary to be disclosed, in the same way]

01:15:47.025 --> 01:15:53.996
[HINDI - it is very necessary to illumine
all those who have talked of the Formless]

01:15:53.996 --> 01:15:59.555
[HINDI - But if you think that by adopting
either of the ways, you'll be successful]

01:15:59.555 --> 01:16:06.318
[HINDI - then it's wrong. Everything is
made by God and in order to maintain what]

01:16:06.318 --> 01:16:15.073
[HINDI - He has created, He has sent His people
or rather we can say, His own forms in this world]

01:16:15.073 --> 01:16:21.992
[HINDI - then you have to validate that 
thing and take that validation [UNCLEAR]

01:16:21.992 --> 01:16:32.097
[HINDI - and receive your Self-realization.
After Self-realization you will have to]

01:16:32.097 --> 01:16:39.110
[HINDI - establish yourself in it. Not that after
getting your Self-realization, just sit down saying,]

01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:44.116
[HINDI - "Yes Mother, I have got it." The first
thing is to get your union and achieving]

01:16:44.116 --> 01:16:48.563
[HINDI - deftness in it. One is the yoga, in
which there is awakening of the Kundalini]

01:16:48.563 --> 01:16:53.135
[HINDI - and breaking open the Brahmarandhra
but you will also have to learn it's skill]

01:16:53.700 --> 01:17:01.330
[HINDI - and upon learning it's skill, you'll
become it's masters. What is it and]

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:07.268
[HINDI - how you can do it, for that there
is a center in your own locality and]

01:17:07.268 --> 01:17:13.675
[HINDI - where you can learn, know and
understand about it and become masters in it.]

01:17:13.907 --> 01:17:19.227
[HINDI - It's very easy even small little
children are very skilled in it and today]

01:17:19.227 --> 01:17:23.865
[HINDI - I see in many homes very great
people have taken birth but you don't even]

01:17:23.865 --> 01:17:28.588
[HINDI - know that they are great men. In
order to understand them also, it's necessary]

01:17:28.588 --> 01:17:32.566
[HINDI - that you get to know your own
Spirit because of which you will be able]

01:17:32.566 --> 01:17:37.058
[HINDI - to understand them also. It's 
absolutely necessary for everyone to know]

01:17:37.058 --> 01:17:42.942
[HINDI - themselves prior to knowing God
and by knowing the Spirit, you'll be able]

01:17:42.942 --> 01:17:47.832
[HINDI - to understand God, before that
you can't understand. The light of the Spirit]

01:17:47.832 --> 01:17:53.599
[HINDI - should first awaken in your attention.
When it's light will enlighten your attention]

01:17:53.599 --> 01:18:02.172
[HINDI - then you can know God only in
that Light. Thus, first you see/feel your Spirit,]

01:18:02.626 --> 01:18:08.750
[HINDI - get to it and keep only this
desire in the beginning. Along with it,]

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:16.820
[HINDI - what is God, you will understand.
May God bless you all!]

01:18:22.660 --> 01:18:25.826
[HINDI - Now, if you have any questions,
you may ask a few.]

01:18:38.734 --> 01:18:41.814
[MARATHI - What is the question?]

01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.148
SYogi: [HINDI - How can we get rid of the
bad thoughts and the anxieties of the mind?]

01:18:47.741 --> 01:18:56.891
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Oh, you are not listening
to what I said when you've asked the question]

01:18:56.896 --> 01:19:02.507
[HINDI - "How to get rid of the bad
thoughts and anxieties of the mind?"]

01:19:02.507 --> 01:19:10.198
[HINDI - I'm telling, "You should get to your Spirit."
If you had asked, "How to get to the Spirit?"

01:19:10.198 --> 01:19:17.314
[HINDI - then still it was something.
Any other question?]

01:19:24.221 --> 01:19:30.461
SYogi: I have been [HINDI - It's a long question.]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Long question. Is it a
question or letter?]

01:19:30.694 --> 01:19:33.300
Seeker: [HINDI - It's a letter, Mataji]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - It is a letter]

01:19:33.300 --> 01:19:36.536
Seeker, [HINDI - Means, it contains the
question within]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - At least ask the question]

01:19:36.536 --> 01:19:41.976
Seeker: [HINDI - My Kundalini has been raised
thrice but every time my mind was not in control]

01:19:41.976 --> 01:19:47.110
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What happened all 
the three times?]
Seeker: [HINDI - Mind was not in control.
It happened by itself.]

01:19:47.110 --> 01:19:49.763
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Who did Kundalini
awakening? Who awakened?]

01:19:49.763 --> 01:19:52.420
Seeker : [HINDI - First time that Sai baba]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Wah, wah, wah! Alright]

01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:58.580
Seeker: [HINDI - Second time it happened 
(UNCLEAR - RAJNISH?)]
[Shri Mataji laughs]

01:19:58.580 --> 01:20:02.360
Seeker: [HINDI - And third time in
Pashupatinath]

01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:07.679
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Now it is obvious.
Even the mad are cured with us and there]

01:20:07.679 --> 01:20:12.193
[HINDI - even the good become mad - this
is the proof of it. I don't talk ill of anyone]

01:20:13.300 --> 01:20:20.113
[HINDI - Now, one person I told, that - I was
telling yesterday that, the guru who is not right]

01:20:20.113 --> 01:20:23.736
[HINDI - you should not go to him, forehead
should not be bent before him because]

01:20:23.736 --> 01:20:26.593
[HINDI - Ekadasha Rudra catches by that,
that person got up and went away]

01:20:26.593 --> 01:20:30.155
[HINDI - I said, "Was your guru bad,
why did you get up and leave?]

01:20:30.646 --> 01:20:33.906
[HINDI - You said the right thing, son,
you reached the wrong place.]

01:20:35.324 --> 01:20:40.274
[HINDI - None of them do Kundalini awakening
- they do bhoot vidya(deal with the Spirits)]

01:20:47.663 --> 01:20:53.453
Seeker: [HINDI - As You said, "By knowing
the Spirit we can know God. First we should]

01:20:53.503 --> 01:21:01.620
[HINDI - know the Spirit so that we can bear
God. But what is the way to know the Spirit?"]

01:21:01.620 --> 01:21:03.864
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - That is what we have
to do just now. It's a right question]

01:21:03.864 --> 01:21:07.502
[HINDI - We'll do that just now, that's what is
to be done. We'll do that. Said the right thing.]

01:21:07.502 --> 01:21:13.233
[HINDI - This is it, it's a good thing. You've
asked a very good question. Yes, what more?]

01:21:13.450 --> 01:21:17.610
[HINDI - This is what we have to do, we
will do. Any thing else?]

01:21:20.859 --> 01:21:25.900
[HINDI - A variety of funny people have
come up to raise the Kundalini.]

01:21:25.491 --> 01:21:29.151
[HINDI - Drink alcohol in the daytime
and in the evening raise the Kundalini.]

01:21:40.487 --> 01:21:47.277
[HINDI - What's the matter, son?]
Seeker: [HINDI - It's said, that when we
come to this world, we bring our old]

01:21:47.277 --> 01:21:55.679
[HINDI - values or customs with us in our
Kundalini. They are present in the Kundalini
when we come to this world.]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Yes, it is alright]

01:21:55.759 --> 01:22:02.180
Seeker: [HINDI - Then with present day karmas
can these old customs be destroyed by yoga?]

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.613
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - No, it is not because
of yoga, my child. Sit down, I'll tell you]

01:22:05.613 --> 01:22:09.538
[HINDI - There is one Agnya chakra here, about
which I talked yesterday - you all were not here]

01:22:09.538 --> 01:22:14.500
[HINDI - When the Kundalini passes through
the Agnya chakra, then the deity of this]

01:22:14.500 --> 01:22:22.782
[HINDI - Agnya Chakra, who is awakened - our
traditions are nothing but this mind and ego -]

01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:29.560
[HINDI - One is the mind, the other ego,
these two are sucked in and when these are]

01:22:29.560 --> 01:22:34.483
[HINDI - sucked in, the Sahastrara
opens and the Kundalini comes out.]

01:22:34.483 --> 01:22:40.432
[HINDI - Who does this within us? Our
ego only does everything. When you are]

01:22:40.432 --> 01:22:46.621
[HINDI - no more this ego but have become
the Spirit, then which conditionings are
left? They are innocent]

01:22:47.627 --> 01:22:51.827
Seeker: [HINDI - Those which we bring with us]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - You have brought
those but they should also drop off]

01:22:51.827 --> 01:22:58.784
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - We may leave our belongings
in the train also and in such a big happening,
won't it be left behind?]

01:22:58.784 --> 01:23:04.826
[HINDI - Everything drops off, nothing of
it is left behind. That happens by itself]

01:23:04.826 --> 01:23:14.549
[HINDI - This is the speciality of the Kundalini]
SYogi: Mother, will You please tell us,

01:23:14.549 --> 01:23:19.941
how a yogi would know his past birth and can
know whether he will take birth or not with
[UNCLEAR]

01:23:21.146 --> 01:23:31.260
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Hmm, you say]
SYogi: [HINDI - Is past life a reality? Do we
suffer because of the deeds of our last life?]

01:23:31.521 --> 01:23:38.321
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Yes, he's asked, "Is
past life a reality and do we suffer due
to the deeds of our last life?"]

01:23:38.321 --> 01:23:44.000
[HINDI - It's somewhat true, all right but now forget
it. What have you got to do with the last life?]

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.624
[HINDI - Talk of the present. In the present,
I'm sitting before you so what about last
life and what sufferings due to it?]

01:23:49.624 --> 01:23:56.225
[HINDI - We should treat everything. Leave
that now. Specially we Indians are filled up]

01:23:56.225 --> 01:24:00.753
[HINDI - with the ideas of previous lives. 
Whatever you were in your past lives,
what have you got to do with it?]

01:24:02.241 --> 01:24:08.701
[HINDI - Here another person is asking about
previous life and yogi etc - all these are
useless things.]

01:24:09.355 --> 01:24:14.815
[HINDI - I want to talk of the present - 
neither the past nor the future.]

01:24:14.815 --> 01:24:24.348
[HINDI - What will happen in the present.
A Brahmin is a called a 'dwijah',
he has a second birth]

01:24:24.714 --> 01:24:32.434
[HINDI - and a bird is also called a
'dwijah' because it was in an egg form,
now it's become a bird,]

01:24:32.434 --> 01:24:37.752
[HINDI - so suppose, if there are any stains
on it while in the egg form, are those]

01:24:37.752 --> 01:24:44.495
[HINDI - visible when it's become the bird?
When you are going to be fully transformed,]

01:24:46.354 --> 01:24:56.184
[HINDI - when you are going to change completely,
then what is left of the past or the future?]

01:24:56.630 --> 01:25:02.750
[HINDI - You will be transformed completely,
then all these things have dropped off.]

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.602
[HINDI - When the seed has become a
tree, the seed is no more.]

01:25:09.380 --> 01:25:12.940
[HINDI - When the flower becomes a fruit,
the flowers are no more.]

01:25:13.389 --> 01:25:19.739
[HINDI - Now you have become a human-being
from an amoeba. Can you believe that you have]

01:25:19.739 --> 01:25:25.841
[HINDI - become a human-being from a
monkey? Monkey is finished, now you are
a human - this you have to believe.]

01:25:30.864 --> 01:25:35.934
[HINDI - Until it was said by Darwin, if anybody
else had said this, would anyone believe?]

01:25:37.430 --> 01:25:43.293
[HINDI - But now when you have become a
saint, a sadhu - you have become a saint.]

01:25:44.449 --> 01:25:55.479
[HINDI - Tukaram says, "I have also changed, you
also change." 'Bi - ghad' I have transformed
my 'Bi', you also transform yours.]

01:25:56.815 --> 01:26:00.625
[HINDI - The thing is like that only. I 
have been transformed, you also transform]

01:26:02.240 --> 01:26:09.694
[HINDI - Kabirdas says, "Jab mast hue phir kya
bolein?" means, "What to say when I'm in such joy."]

01:26:09.694 --> 01:26:15.742
[HINDI - What? After realization, "Paar
utar gaye sant jana re?" means,
'The saints have been realized.']

01:26:17.720 --> 01:26:20.297
[HINDI - Once you have been realized,
why to talk about the life prior to that.]

01:26:20.297 --> 01:26:23.157
[HINDI - Just talking about the life prior
to realization, stuck to it and even of]

01:26:23.157 --> 01:26:26.741
[HINDI - lives before that, about past
life - leave all that, it's meaningless]

01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:34.944
[HINDI - Now ask such a question,
which is useful? What?]

01:26:34.944 --> 01:26:39.151
SYogi: 'Whether Kundalini yogi can acquire
supernatural powers as Baba Nanak can?'

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:45.644
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Now they have asked another
question] 'Whether Kundalini yogi can acquire]

01:26:45.885 --> 01:26:51.195
supernatural powers as Baba Nanak?'
[HINDI - There is no competition with anyone]

01:26:51.526 --> 01:26:57.236
[HINDI - Baba Nanak was the guru of gurus.
He was the Incarnation of Dattatreya.]

01:26:57.243 --> 01:27:04.130
[HINDI - What do you know about Him?
You ask Me. Now, are you thinking of
becoming God at once?]

01:27:04.130 --> 01:27:10.870
[HINDI - First become a saint. No need
to compete with Baba Nanak. Where 
was He and where are we?]

01:27:10.991 --> 01:27:19.461
[HINDI - We should move with our own
arrangement. Whatever arrangements we have]

01:27:19.461 --> 01:27:24.778
[HINDI - made we should use that fully, then
make further preparations and move further.]

01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:36.654
[HINDI - You are taking His name from now
itself. He was Dattatreya Himself. He was
an Incarnation not a human.]

01:27:37.165 --> 01:27:44.955
[HINDI - You are a human-being. He was
God, are you God? You are a human.]

01:27:45.197 --> 01:27:50.737
[HINDI - You are thinking of being God
suddenly. This is again a talk of the future.]

01:27:50.791 --> 01:27:54.901
[HINDI - Useless - talk of the present,
of this time, this moment.]

01:27:54.901 --> 01:28:01.660
Seeker: [HINDI - When you start experiencing
the essence of the five rasas in the mind, what
vibrations after that?]

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:08.550
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What are you saying?]
Seeker: [HINDI - Like, all the essences like
beauty, color, word etc are experienced]

01:28:08.550 --> 01:28:13.754
SYogi: [HINDI - When you start experiencing
the five rasas of life, what after that?]

01:28:13.954 --> 01:28:19.724
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - There is no such experience
of the rasas. This should not happen, It's all wrong]

01:28:20.725 --> 01:28:22.945
Seeker: [HINDI - Is it wrong?]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - It is wrong.]

01:28:22.945 --> 01:28:30.549
[HINDI - In the experience of the Atma, you should
feel the vibrations. Ras etc is from the senses,]

01:28:30.549 --> 01:28:36.876
[HINDI - which are from the imperceptible
but in reality Atma is related to vibrations]

01:28:36.908 --> 01:28:39.882
[HINDI - Firstly, you should feel the
vibrations]

01:28:39.882 --> 01:28:50.898
Seeker: [HINDI - Because of that (UNCLEAR)
for example, in the path of Kundalini,
without doing anything]

01:28:50.898 --> 01:29:02.374
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Yes, spontaneously, sahaja]
Seeker: [HINDI - And from this Sahaj,
I can't say what I got, I can't tell]

01:29:02.374 --> 01:29:05.574
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Are you a Sahaja yogi?]
Seeker: [HINDI - Yes, please?]

01:29:05.574 --> 01:29:08.369
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Are you a Sahaja yogi?]
Seeker: [HINDI - I am nothing]

01:29:08.369 --> 01:29:12.599
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then you first get your
realization. Leave this talk. It's a web of words.]

01:29:12.599 --> 01:29:16.896
[HINDI - You sit down. Useless talks.
It's meaningless. It has no meaning.]

01:29:16.896 --> 01:29:20.833
[HINDI - Just a web of words. After reading
two books, start talking about it.]

01:29:20.833 --> 01:29:24.280
Seeker: [HINDI - No, I don't read any
books, no books]
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Yes, then?]

01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:29.206
Seeker: [HINDI - That's what I want to tell you. I
haven't read any book or any interest in books.]

01:29:29.206 --> 01:29:31.390
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Then you are so
good, you'll get your realization soon.]

01:29:31.390 --> 01:29:39.920
[HINDI - Sit down, leave it. If you haven't
read anything, then it's better. It's a
problem with the ones who read a lot.]

01:29:39.321 --> 01:29:43.711
SYogi: [HINDI - He says, 'What are Your views
about Kriya yog of Paramhans Yoganand?]

01:29:43.711 --> 01:29:51.415
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Child, ours is
Inaction yoga, not kriya yog. Akriya.]

01:29:53.375 --> 01:29:59.355
[HINDI - These people have understood
Kriya yog wrongly. Absolutely vice versa.]

01:29:59.355 --> 01:30:11.735
[HINDI - See. When the car moves, the wheels
move by themselves, all the machinery
moves of its own - isn't it correct?]

01:30:11.835 --> 01:30:21.385
[HINDI - But if you start turning the wheels
before the car moves or move it steering,
then the car will breakdown]

01:30:21.878 --> 01:30:29.208
[HINDI - This Kriya yog means, like you
cut your tongue, bring the tongue down,]

01:30:29.208 --> 01:30:37.707
[HINDI - let it hang, then take it back,
then do khechri. Will you get God by this?]

01:30:37.707 --> 01:30:46.681
[HINDI - And people believe in it. Shave off your
head, cut your hair. Oho, Kabirdas has written -]

01:30:46.681 --> 01:30:50.751
[HINDI - and people say, he writes in 'Sadukadi'
language, he's written about one and all.]

01:30:50.751 --> 01:31:00.770
[HINDI - He's written, "By shaving off the head,
if anyone can go to God, then the sheep -]

01:31:00.770 --> 01:31:06.602
[HINDI - what to talk of the head, their
whole body is sheared twice a year
- they must have reached God's door."]

01:31:07.904 --> 01:31:14.284
[HINDI - But who reads him? This Kriya yog,
that you shave off the head, wear saffron clothes]

01:31:14.332 --> 01:31:19.392
[HINDI - and move about with a big bell on
your head that you're a very great sadhu
or saint, then will you become one?]

01:31:19.959 --> 01:31:22.989
[HINDI - This you are moving on untruth,
have not arrived on the Truth]

01:31:23.123 --> 01:31:28.723
[HINDI - and all such people are useless.
Keeping a big name for themselves is of no use.]

01:31:28.937 --> 01:31:31.849
[HINDI - Now there are so many disciples
of that person, who's name you mentioned]

01:31:31.849 --> 01:31:35.498
[HINDI - their tongues are hanging down in
front, like this, go and see in America]

01:31:35.498 --> 01:31:40.910
[HINDI - Tongue hanging like a dog - that,
"Yoganand Swami has done our khechri."]

01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:44.755
[HINDI - What khechri has been done! Nowadays
he's having everyone shave off their heads]

01:31:44.755 --> 01:31:48.409
[HINDI - A woman came here, her head was
completely shaved off. I asked her, "Why?"]

01:31:48.409 --> 01:31:50.649
[HINDI - She said, "They have got
everyone's head shaved off in the ashram."]

01:31:50.649 --> 01:31:53.709
[HINDI - Why don't you all read Kabirdas,
what he has to say about this?]

01:31:55.901 --> 01:32:02.421
[HINDI - Getting the head shaved off, wearing
long gowns - did he say that sadhus and sanyasis]

01:32:02.421 --> 01:32:08.694
[HINDI - should take to outer renunciation.
Sitaji has said that, "If any sanyasi comes]

01:32:08.694 --> 01:32:13.340
[HINDI - to your house, make him sit
outside. Should not enter our main door,]

01:32:13.374 --> 01:32:17.790
[HINDI - we are householders. We have our
own pure life." We are living in oblation,]

01:32:17.790 --> 01:32:22.225
[HINDI - we are householders. Just now a sanyasi
had come, why did he have to come inside?]

01:32:22.418 --> 01:32:29.838
[HINDI - Any saint, who was a real one
- our old Sai Nath, Adi Shankaracharyaji]

01:32:29.838 --> 01:32:34.448
[HINDI - Never set foot inside the main door.
Maybe due to some work - they have a short life,]

01:32:34.448 --> 01:32:40.225
[HINDI - they come to the world, that's 
why due to their work, they remain sanyasis;]

01:32:40.225 --> 01:32:45.130
[HINDI - Nothing wrong with that. But such
people don't indulge in households,]

01:32:45.130 --> 01:32:49.415
[HINDI - they have no relation to the
household, they live outside having
nothing to do with householders]

01:32:49.415 --> 01:32:53.677
[HINDI - The householders are doing their
sacrificial deeds, running their households]

01:32:53.677 --> 01:32:58.206
[HINDI - and these people want to live on
their money. This is their everyday business.]

01:32:58.949 --> 01:33:05.929
[HINDI - I had gone to that place - which place -
many newspaper people came from Nagar district.]

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:12.410
[HINDI - They said, "Mataji, first the
rich people gave sugar to the ants -]

01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:17.823
[HINDI - now as there are no ants left due to
excessive sugar in this area, in Nagar district,]

01:33:18.103 --> 01:33:22.303
[HINDI - thus they have collected ants."
I asked them, "What do you mean?"]

01:33:22.303 --> 01:33:25.049
[HINDI - They said, "They have collected
'Hare Rama Hare Krishna' people,]

01:33:25.049 --> 01:33:29.614
[HINDI - they give lands to them and build
houses for them. These people sing bhajans]

01:33:29.614 --> 01:33:34.531
[HINDI - and keep begging on the streets.
We have at least 500 beggars of these]

01:33:34.531 --> 01:33:37.779
[HINDI - 'Hare Rama Hare Krishna' sitting
there. They have put these fair-skinned]

01:33:37.779 --> 01:33:45.449
[HINDI - ants on our heads, now who's
going to look after them? Every second
day they are on our doors begging.]

01:33:45.449 --> 01:33:52.846
[HINDI - All those who beg, these beggars,
how can they be people of God Almighty, 
I can't understand?"]

01:33:53.680 --> 01:34:00.723
[HINDI - Begging all the time is forbidden.
Even a hermit begs just once for food not that]

01:34:00.723 --> 01:34:05.880
[HINDI - going from door to door begging for
money, this and that. They live in their pride]

01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:09.200
[HINDI - because they don't cook food.
But where are such sanyasis(saints)?]

01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:14.661
[HINDI - Nowadays these are just made up
saints in the world, they are just show-offs.]

01:34:14.661 --> 01:34:19.931
[HINDI - If you can't make out what can I do?
Why move about becoming such a sanyasi?]

01:34:19.931 --> 01:34:24.233
[HINDI - What is the necessity of becoming a
sanyasi? Renunciation is a thing of the inside.]

01:34:25.358 --> 01:34:35.498
[HINDI - Gurunanak, Himself was a great
ascetic and when He was in the form of 
King Janak, He lived like a king]

01:34:35.498 --> 01:34:40.826
[HINDI - and ruled like one then too He
was a sanyasi and people called Him 'Videhi']

01:34:40.826 --> 01:34:45.909
[HINDI - that's why His daughter is called
'Vaidehi'. Now everything is in front of]

01:34:45.909 --> 01:34:50.696
[HINDI - of us and we don't even think
of it. Don't know what has happened, 
as if a curtain is drawn over.]

01:34:51.422 --> 01:34:56.320
[HINDI - And any babaji comes, the women
have to go there first to touch his feet.]

01:34:56.320 --> 01:34:59.882
[HINDI - He's a sanyasi, what have you
to do with him, you are a householder.]

01:35:00.748 --> 01:35:06.598
[HINDI - What have you to do, whether
he's a sanyasi or an unrelated male?]

01:35:08.534 --> 01:35:17.311
[HINDI - Like, it's written in our religion,
that a woman should live by her dharma
and a man by his]

01:35:17.311 --> 01:35:22.863
[HINDI - and a saint should live by his
otherwise like Ravana, who disguised himself]

01:35:22.863 --> 01:35:32.209
[HINDI - as a sanyasi and took away Sita with
him. So all these things like Kriya Yog etc]

01:35:32.209 --> 01:35:37.924
[HINDI - are not to be done now - it's
all a show, money-making business.]

01:35:43.234 --> 01:35:51.714
[HINDI - No need to become a sanyasi]
Seeker: [HINDI - Mataji, please awaken
the power of Kundalini]

01:35:51.714 --> 01:35:55.975
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - What, child?]
Seeker: [HINDI - Awaken the power of Kundalini,
which You told]

01:35:55.975 --> 01:35:58.157
SYogi: [HINDI - Awakening of Kundalini power]
Shri Mataji: [MARATHI - What's it?]

01:35:58.157 --> 01:36:00.456
SYogi: [HINDI - What You told about
awakening of Kundalini power]
Shri Mataji: Hmm

01:36:00.588 --> 01:36:06.448
Seeker: [HINDI - For this is it necessary -
by chanting the names to awaken the
Kundalini, can't do by ourselves?]

01:36:06.448 --> 01:36:11.687
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - It will never happen, child, it's
a wrong thing. For that a true guru should be there]

01:36:11.687 --> 01:36:15.590
[HINDI - And by one's self is absolutely
wrong but also it's very difficult]

01:36:15.590 --> 01:36:18.182
[HINDI - to get a true guru(satguru).
There is no one these days ]

01:36:18.341 --> 01:36:23.931
Seeker: [HINDI - Then is it compulsory to try
something separately for Kundalini awakening?]

01:36:23.931 --> 01:36:27.455
Shri Mataji: No, nothing.
Seeker: [HINDI - Won't happen by chanting
the name by myself?]

01:36:27.455 --> 01:36:30.469
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - Never, will never
happen. It's false, will never happen.]

01:36:30.469 --> 01:36:33.746
[HINDI - Where is it written that by chanting
the name it will happen? They said that,]

01:36:33.746 --> 01:36:37.759
[HINDI - "Take the name of God." That
doesn't mean that you just chant His name]

01:36:38.330 --> 01:36:45.690
[HINDI - Arre, he's said, 'Karka manka
chaadi de, manka manka pher' (HINDI COUPLET)
Now no one reads, what to do?]

01:36:47.573 --> 01:36:54.113
[HINDI - Taking the name of God, with 
heart, once, is enough. If you go to some]

01:36:54.113 --> 01:36:58.253
[HINDI - minister's place and call out his
name ten times, the police will catch you]

01:36:58.873 --> 01:37:04.843
[HINDI - and God's name you take
many hundred times, who knows how
many diseases will catch hold of you?]

01:37:04.843 --> 01:37:13.670
[HINDI - It's a wrong thing. God is full of
all the powers, thus if you have to go on]

01:37:13.670 --> 01:37:19.443
[HINDI - His path, first realize your
Spirit, then go. This is all wrong that
just sitting and chanting His name]

01:37:20.923 --> 01:37:25.564
[HINDI - All this is mechanical - it will not happen
with that and if it has happened, it is wrong.]

01:37:26.405 --> 01:37:32.436
[HINDI - If there is any real guru, he can
awaken your Kundalini and then a]

01:37:32.436 --> 01:37:38.147
[HINDI - Mother's thing is something different.]
Seeker: [HINDI - You must have said by Your experience]

01:37:38.147 --> 01:37:40.771
Shri Mataji: [HINDI - They are chaitanya
lahiris(vibrations), the power of Brahma]

01:37:40.771 --> 01:37:46.807
[HINDI - You can know that. When you ask,
"Mother, is this the Power of Brahm,
you'll receive more on your hands."]

01:37:49.810 --> 01:37:55.951
[HINDI - Any question you want to ask, like
a computer is on, you can ask any question.]

01:37:55.951 --> 01:38:01.395
[HINDI - If the answer is 'Yes' you'll receive
a lot and feel joyous and if it's wrong,]

01:38:01.395 --> 01:38:04.589
[HINDI - there'll be a burning sensation,
sometimes blisters may also come,]

01:38:04.589 --> 01:38:11.370
[HINDI - anything else can also happen,
numbness may come but if it's 'Yes',
the flow will be strong.]

01:38:12.881 --> 01:38:15.491
[HINDI - You can also feel the Brahm
shakti from here(fontanel bone area),]

01:38:15.491 --> 01:38:17.922
[HINDI - if your Kundalini is awakened.
Is it okay?]

01:38:20.883 --> 01:38:24.993
Seeker: Is it true that these false gurus make you
do their mantras and then you chant them

01:38:24.993 --> 01:38:29.690
and then afterwards (UNCLEAR) starts working
on you. Is that the energy that (UNCLEAR)?

01:38:29.690 --> 01:38:36.771
Shri Mataji: You have said it. You have
said it. What you have said, is correct.]

01:38:37.115 --> 01:38:42.355
They do all kinds of things. This is not 
the only thing. They mesmerize you, they

01:38:42.478 --> 01:38:47.398
harm you - most of the cancer and all
these diseases come from these gurus only.

01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:54.690
They try to do all kinds of things to you, if
they are bad gurus. They are, most of them are

01:38:54.690 --> 01:39:01.677
absolute criminals, rakshasas - horrible.
Don't listen to them, don't go near them.

01:39:02.328 --> 01:39:07.308
Alright? We'll have to work it out, if you
have been to them, it's rather difficult

01:39:07.308 --> 01:39:10.976
but we'll work it out, alright? So
you have to cooperate with yourself.

01:39:16.172 --> 01:39:20.712
They give you epilepsy, they give you

with both his legs towards Me. I told him]

01:42:54.140 --> 01:42:57.362
[HINDI - not to sit like that. People went
and told him not to sit like that. He said,]

01:42:57.362 --> 01:43:04.331

legs folded, I start jumping like a frog?"]

01:43:05.223 --> 01:43:10.073

like this only. Again second time.]

01:57:12.006 --> 01:57:16.852
[HINDI - Because of three powers, we do it
three times. Now see properly. You should]

01:57:16.852 --> 01:57:27.482
[HINDI - not rotate the other way round. Now again
take it on the top and tie knot tightly, like this.]

01:57:28.625 --> 01:57:32.985
[HINDI - Now the third time you have to
tie three knots and have to keep]

01:57:32.985 --> 01:57:36.755
[HINDI - the hand on top for all the
three knots. Now again, move your hand]

01:57:36.755 --> 01:57:40.972
[HINDI - and again raise the Kundalini. 
We are raising our Surti(Kundalini)]

01:57:40.972 --> 01:57:54.159
[HINDI - See, raise. Now take it on the head
and very nicely one, two and three knots.]

01:57:54.159 --> 01:58:03.645
[HINDI - Now do your hands like this on your
lap. Now raise both the hands on the top]

01:58:03.645 --> 01:58:09.766
[HINDI - and ask a question in your heart, "Is this
the Brahm shakti?" With full heart, eyes closed.]

01:58:09.986 --> 01:58:21.146
[HINDI - "Is this the Brahm Shakti, Mother?"
See, you can feel the cool in your hands.]

01:58:22.936 --> 01:58:28.166
[HINDI - Something is happening inside,
going on. Some power is descending.]

01:58:28.166 --> 01:58:35.363
[HINDI - Now do your hands like this.
Now close your eyes in thoughtlessness]

01:58:35.363 --> 01:58:38.219
[HINDI - Go in meditation.]

01:59:04.326 --> 01:59:10.486
[HINDI - There's only one lecture of
Mine here but there's our center here]

01:59:10.486 --> 01:59:18.188
[HINDI - where you can go and we have books
also here which you can take but while]

01:59:18.188 --> 01:59:26.091
[HINDI - reading the book don't get into
thoughts. We should know, that in Sahaja yoga]

01:59:26.091 --> 01:59:33.277
[HINDI - we don't think from the mind, we work
with the hand. All the power is in the hands]

01:59:33.277 --> 01:59:37.989
[HINDI - thus don't use your brains on
it. It will not happen with thinking]

01:59:38.091 --> 01:59:46.881
[HINDI - everything is to be done with
the hands. How to go and move ahead,]

01:59:46.881 --> 01:59:53.476
[HINDI - whatever we have achieved, how to
establish it, for that forget who you are]

01:59:53.476 --> 01:59:59.543
[HINDI - and in what position for that we have a
small center because we don't charge any money]

02:00:00.263 --> 02:00:08.323
[HINDI - you go there and establish yourselves to
receive it. It's very necessary, extremely essential]

02:00:09.176 --> 02:00:16.726
[HINDI - If this doesn't happen, we don't know
what disasters from within human beings]

02:00:16.726 --> 02:00:24.222
[HINDI - will happen thus you please, I request
you, I'm like your Mother, pay heed to yourself]

02:00:24.222 --> 02:00:29.329
[HINDI - love your own Self, and give time
to the thing which is most important.]

02:00:31.364 --> 02:00:40.804
[HINDI - Again, I thank again and again all
the managers and directors of this temple]

02:00:40.899 --> 02:00:49.819
[HINDI - for all their favours and they
have done the greatest virtuous act that]

02:00:49.819 --> 02:00:57.404
[HINDI - they have given an opportunity
to so many people to gain self knowledge]

02:00:57.404 --> 02:01:02.344
[HINDI - and you people also take full 
advantage of this, complete advantage.]

02:01:10.765 --> 02:01:19.595
[HINDI - What child? Just talk about the center.
You all write it down and take full advantage of it]

02:01:19.595 --> 02:01:23.641
[HINDI - It will not be done with this?]

02:01:24.580 --> 02:01:31.540
SYogi: [HINDI - Our center is in New Rajendra
Nagar area in Mr. G. Prasad's house.]

02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:41.197
[HINDI - His address is - E 209, E block,
house no. 209. His name is Mr. Prasad]

02:01:44.884 --> 02:01:51.014
[HINDI - In Sahaja yoga, when you
learn some Sahaja yoga in your center,]

02:01:51.014 --> 02:01:59.533
[HINDI - then you go to the main center. At first
you have to establish only thoughtless awareness]

02:01:59.533 --> 02:02:04.418
[HINDI - later on doubtless awareness and
then you can go to the main center also]

02:02:04.418 --> 02:02:07.000
[HINDI - but it should start first.]
