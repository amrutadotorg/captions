00:18:40.890 --> 00:18:44.466
I didn’t give any lecture to the girls.

00:18:44.688 --> 00:18:48.375
I think it is more the responsibility of the men

00:18:48.602 --> 00:18:51.365
to make their marriages successful.

00:19:01.753 --> 00:19:03.978
Men have to understand

00:19:04.182 --> 00:19:07.514
that marriage is a very important part of your life.

00:19:14.178 --> 00:19:19.136
And your time and respect should be given for that.

00:19:26.456 --> 00:19:31.343
The way you care for your wife

00:19:31.597 --> 00:19:34.856
from the very beginning helps you a lot.

00:19:41.365 --> 00:19:44.413
You try and understand

00:19:45.366 --> 00:19:47.640
what she wants,

00:19:48.116 --> 00:19:52.280
what are her demands -

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:53.681
anything,

00:19:53.881 --> 00:19:56.771
try to see that

00:19:57.772 --> 00:20:00.623
you show her your interest in her.

00:20:07.933 --> 00:20:11.854
From the very first day, be careful

00:20:12.054 --> 00:20:16.380
not to neglect her and to misunderstand her.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:28.204
She comes from another country,

00:20:28.404 --> 00:20:31.540
so she has her own upbringing,

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.922
her own ideas.

00:20:34.122 --> 00:20:36.589
Try to understand and respect that.

00:20:42.873 --> 00:20:45.408
Marriage is all joy,

00:20:45.381 --> 00:20:48.510
but you must take it up very seriously.

00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:51.008
It’s not just a joke.

00:20:57.557 --> 00:21:00.575
Specially in Sahaja Yoga, one should understand

00:21:00.784 --> 00:21:05.523
that marriage is a very important thing,

00:21:05.723 --> 00:21:10.714
by which you have a couple which are sanctified.

00:21:20.380 --> 00:21:24.775
And they carry the responsibility of

00:21:24.991 --> 00:21:28.256
making the Sahaja Yoga very successful.

00:21:38.124 --> 00:21:40.205
Sahaja Yoga is

00:21:40.405 --> 00:21:46.530
a great thing, because it can transform the whole world into a very beautiful place.

00:21:53.850 --> 00:21:56.455
And you are responsible for that.

00:22:00.047 --> 00:22:05.158
As men, you should understand your responsibility as a

00:22:05.440 --> 00:22:11.880
great person, who is the, sort of a head of the family.

00:22:22.856 --> 00:22:27.397
I – yesterday I told you that I don’t believe in divorce,

00:22:27.627 --> 00:22:32.707
but I expect you to be very good husbands,

00:22:32.907 --> 00:22:38.858
who will give all love, all affection, all care to your wives.

00:22:52.104 --> 00:22:54.087
In Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:54.384 --> 00:22:57.122
men and women are absolutely equal.

00:22:57.322 --> 00:23:00.379
They may not be similar, but they are absolutely equal.

00:23:07.121 --> 00:23:09.706
And they are complementary to each other.

00:23:13.667 --> 00:23:18.001
You should not think that your life is the most important one,

00:23:18.201 --> 00:23:21.920
and that your wife is something negligible.

00:23:29.189 --> 00:23:33.520
I have seen most of the marriages in Sahaja Yoga are successful,

00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.225
and they have very nice children also.

00:23:44.746 --> 00:23:49.874
Marriages only fail when there is the play of ego.

00:23:55.034 --> 00:23:58.006
That is more with men than women -  normally.

00:24:02.806 --> 00:24:06.434
And that can ruin the lives

00:24:07.170 --> 00:24:10.752
of your wife and yourself, your children.

00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:22.574
Women are sensible,

00:24:22.774 --> 00:24:25.677
but they can tolerate up to a point.

00:24:31.598 --> 00:24:35.009
So we should see how much wisdom you have,

00:24:35.209 --> 00:24:37.054
to make a good

00:24:41.952 --> 00:24:45.795
Sahaja Yoga is one big, global family.

00:24:49.362 --> 00:24:53.303
So you have also your responsibility

00:24:53.503 --> 00:24:58.253
to the whole organization of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:05.945 --> 00:25:07.994
She is coming from another

00:25:08.194 --> 00:25:11.892
family, another country, another atmosphere,

00:25:12.092 --> 00:25:16.047
so try to make her understand and adjust herself.

00:25:26.895 --> 00:25:30.123
So don’t try to find faults with her,

00:25:30.222 --> 00:25:33.820
but make her feel comfortable and happy,

00:25:33.946 --> 00:25:36.565
then she can grow in Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:25:48.251 --> 00:25:51.417
And your children must respect the mother -

00:25:51.692 --> 00:25:53.756
absolutely.

00:25:58.681 --> 00:26:00.761
As you respect Me,

00:26:00.961 --> 00:26:03.899
your children should also respect their mother.

00:26:08.428 --> 00:26:12.263
I am sure you are going to have a very nice time,

00:26:12.463 --> 00:26:15.528
If you are sensible about your marriage.

00:26:20.955 --> 00:26:23.824
There is no force in Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:24.024 --> 00:26:27.097
You have decided to marry in Sahaja Yoga

00:26:27.297 --> 00:26:30.398
and so the marriage has taken place.

00:26:36.414 --> 00:26:39.635
I have not told anything to the ladies this time,

00:26:39.835 --> 00:26:42.670
because they look so sensible, so anxious

00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:46.237
and looking for the future.

00:26:57.087 --> 00:27:00.211
I think always men should

00:27:00.411 --> 00:27:05.124
try to understand the responsibility of a married life,

00:27:05.324 --> 00:27:07.144
more than women.

00:27:15.459 --> 00:27:19.433
Innately, the women know

00:27:19.633 --> 00:27:22.114
and understand that it’s important

00:27:22.314 --> 00:27:24.710
that their married life should be successful.

00:27:32.679 --> 00:27:36.071
But I’ve found out sometimes the men take them for granted -

00:27:36.271 --> 00:27:38.122
that should not be such.

00:27:43.504 --> 00:27:46.257
For everything she does for you,

00:27:46.457 --> 00:27:51.324
and with all love and affection, you must appreciate it.

00:27:57.132 --> 00:27:59.072
You should appreciate her,

00:27:59.272 --> 00:28:04.025
that’s the only way you can show your love to her.

00:28:10.759 --> 00:28:14.485
You know, in Sahaja Yoga we don’t allow

00:28:14.571 --> 00:28:19.383
men to go about with other women, or women going about with other men.

00:28:19.535 --> 00:28:21.724
It’s not allowed at all - no way.

00:28:29.971 --> 00:28:34.804
I think you are all sensible and you will understand your responsibility,

00:28:35.212 --> 00:28:37.440
marrying a Sahaja Yogini –

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:39.968
you are not marrying an ordinary woman,

00:28:40.168 --> 00:28:44.895
you are marrying a Sahaja Yogini and you pay all the due to her.

00:28:55.302 --> 00:28:58.269
That’s how you will glorify Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:00.597 --> 00:29:02.561
May God bless you all.

01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:20.456
Shri Mataji: Not yet. Very good.

01:42:25.674 --> 01:42:28.982
Congratulations to all of you.

01:42:46.069 --> 01:42:51.395
It’s a very beautiful experience for me also,

01:42:51.577 --> 01:42:56.050
to see you all are married so happily with each other,

01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:00.627
and assuring Me that you’ll lead a very happy

01:43:00.827 --> 01:43:04.881
and congenial married life.

01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.063
I’m sure you can do it.

01:43:07.196 --> 01:43:09.079
It’s not so difficult.

01:43:09.210 --> 01:43:14.890
In Sahaja Yoga you know how to love and how to express love.

01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:18.712
And these marriages are based on Divine love,

01:43:18.912 --> 01:43:21.751
that’s even purer, much higher

01:43:21.982 --> 01:43:24.214
and much more joy-giving.

01:43:24.414 --> 01:43:27.362
So I bless you all
with My, all My heart,

01:43:27.524 --> 01:43:30.299
that you all enjoy
your married life.

01:43:30.436 --> 01:43:32.255
Enjoy is the point.

01:43:32.401 --> 01:43:35.873
If you cannot enjoy your married life, it will be a misery.

01:43:36.073 --> 01:43:38.863
So I want to tell you, whatever is there,

01:43:39.019 --> 01:43:41.667
learn how to enjoy everything.

01:43:41.877 --> 01:43:43.983
That’s the best way you can do it.

01:43:44.183 --> 01:43:47.667
Just now, as you were telling about your names and describing,

01:43:47.867 --> 01:43:51.073
I felt such a collective feeling within you

01:43:51.273 --> 01:43:53.823
to understand each other, appreciate each other,

01:43:54.023 --> 01:43:58.252
and to feel the joy together.

01:43:58.452 --> 01:44:01.214
That’s something great that’s in Sahaja Yoga.

01:44:01.414 --> 01:44:03.708
So may God bless you,

01:44:04.732 --> 01:44:07.458
with all My heart I bless you.
