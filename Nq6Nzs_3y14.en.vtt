18:40.890 --> 18:44.466
I didn’t give any lecture to the girls.

18:44.688 --> 18:48.375
I think it is more the responsibility of the men

18:48.602 --> 18:51.365
to make their marriages successful.

19:01.753 --> 19:03.978
Men have to understand

19:04.182 --> 19:07.514
that marriage is a very important part of your life.

19:14.178 --> 19:19.136
And your time and respect should be given for that.

19:26.456 --> 19:31.343
The way you care for your wife

19:31.597 --> 19:34.856
from the very beginning helps you a lot.

19:41.365 --> 19:44.413
You try and understand

19:45.366 --> 19:47.640
what she wants,

19:48.116 --> 19:52.280
what are her demands -

19:52.480 --> 19:53.681
anything,

19:53.881 --> 19:56.771
try to see that

19:57.772 --> 20:00.623
you show her your interest in her.

20:07.933 --> 20:11.854
From the very first day, be careful

20:12.054 --> 20:16.380
not to neglect her and to misunderstand her.

20:25.700 --> 20:28.204
She comes from another country,

20:28.404 --> 20:31.540
so she has her own upbringing,

20:31.740 --> 20:33.922
her own ideas.

20:34.122 --> 20:36.589
Try to understand and respect that.

20:42.873 --> 20:45.408
Marriage is all joy,

20:45.381 --> 20:48.510
but you must take it up very seriously.

20:48.710 --> 20:51.008
It’s not just a joke.

20:57.557 --> 21:00.575
Specially in Sahaja Yoga, one should understand

21:00.784 --> 21:05.523
that marriage is a very important thing,

21:05.723 --> 21:10.714
by which you have a couple which are sanctified.

21:20.380 --> 21:24.775
And they carry the responsibility of

21:24.991 --> 21:28.256
making the Sahaja Yoga very successful.

21:38.124 --> 21:40.205
Sahaja Yoga is

21:40.405 --> 21:46.530
a great thing, because it can transform the whole world into a very beautiful place.

21:53.850 --> 21:56.455
And you are responsible for that.

22:00.047 --> 22:05.158
As men, you should understand your responsibility as a

22:05.440 --> 22:11.880
great person, who is the, sort of a head of the family.

22:22.856 --> 22:27.397
I – yesterday I told you that I don’t believe in divorce,

22:27.627 --> 22:32.707
but I expect you to be very good husbands,

22:32.907 --> 22:38.858
who will give all love, all affection, all care to your wives.

22:52.104 --> 22:54.087
In Sahaja Yoga,

22:54.384 --> 22:57.122
men and women are absolutely equal.

22:57.322 --> 23:00.379
They may not be similar, but they are absolutely equal.

23:07.121 --> 23:09.706
And they are complementary to each other.

23:13.667 --> 23:18.001
You should not think that your life is the most important one,

23:18.201 --> 23:21.920
and that your wife is something negligible.

23:29.189 --> 23:33.520
I have seen most of the marriages in Sahaja Yoga are successful,

23:33.720 --> 23:36.225
and they have very nice children also.

23:44.746 --> 23:49.874
Marriages only fail when there is the play of ego.

23:55.034 --> 23:58.006
That is more with men than women -  normally.

24:02.806 --> 24:06.434
And that can ruin the lives

24:07.170 --> 24:10.752
of your wife and yourself, your children.

24:19.970 --> 24:22.574
Women are sensible,

24:22.774 --> 24:25.677
but they can tolerate up to a point.

24:31.598 --> 24:35.009
So we should see how much wisdom you have,

24:35.209 --> 24:37.054
to make a good

24:41.952 --> 24:45.795
Sahaja Yoga is one big, global family.

24:49.362 --> 24:53.303
So you have also your responsibility

24:53.503 --> 24:58.253
to the whole organization of Sahaja Yoga.

25:05.945 --> 25:07.994
She is coming from another

25:08.194 --> 25:11.892
family, another country, another atmosphere,

25:12.092 --> 25:16.047
so try to make her understand and adjust herself.

25:26.895 --> 25:30.123
So don’t try to find faults with her,

25:30.222 --> 25:33.820
but make her feel comfortable and happy,

25:33.946 --> 25:36.565
then she can grow in Sahaja Yoga very well.

25:48.251 --> 25:51.417
And your children must respect the mother -

25:51.692 --> 25:53.756
absolutely.

25:58.681 --> 26:00.761
As you respect Me,

26:00.961 --> 26:03.899
your children should also respect their mother.

26:08.428 --> 26:12.263
I am sure you are going to have a very nice time,

26:12.463 --> 26:15.528
If you are sensible about your marriage.

26:20.955 --> 26:23.824
There is no force in Sahaja Yoga.

26:24.024 --> 26:27.097
You have decided to marry in Sahaja Yoga

26:27.297 --> 26:30.398
and so the marriage has taken place.

26:36.414 --> 26:39.635
I have not told anything to the ladies this time,

26:39.835 --> 26:42.670
because they look so sensible, so anxious

26:42.870 --> 26:46.237
and looking for the future.

26:57.087 --> 27:00.211
I think always men should

27:00.411 --> 27:05.124
try to understand the responsibility of a married life,

27:05.324 --> 27:07.144
more than women.

27:15.459 --> 27:19.433
Innately, the women know

27:19.633 --> 27:22.114
and understand that it’s important

27:22.314 --> 27:24.710
that their married life should be successful.

27:32.679 --> 27:36.071
But I’ve found out sometimes the men take them for granted -

27:36.271 --> 27:38.122
that should not be such.

27:43.504 --> 27:46.257
For everything she does for you,

27:46.457 --> 27:51.324
and with all love and affection, you must appreciate it.

27:57.132 --> 27:59.072
You should appreciate her,

27:59.272 --> 28:04.025
that’s the only way you can show your love to her.

28:10.759 --> 28:14.485
You know, in Sahaja Yoga we don’t allow

28:14.571 --> 28:19.383
men to go about with other women, or women going about with other men.

28:19.535 --> 28:21.724
It’s not allowed at all - no way.

28:29.971 --> 28:34.804
I think you are all sensible and you will understand your responsibility,

28:35.212 --> 28:37.440
marrying a Sahaja Yogini –

28:37.640 --> 28:39.968
you are not marrying an ordinary woman,

28:40.168 --> 28:44.895
you are marrying a Sahaja Yogini and you pay all the due to her.

28:55.302 --> 28:58.269
That’s how you will glorify Sahaja Yoga.

29:00.597 --> 29:02.561
May God bless you all.

01:42:18.581 --> 01:42:20.456
Shri Mataji: Not yet. Very good.

01:42:25.674 --> 01:42:28.982
Congratulations to all of you.

01:42:46.069 --> 01:42:51.395
It’s a very beautiful experience for me also,

01:42:51.577 --> 01:42:56.050
to see you all are married so happily with each other,

01:42:56.260 --> 01:43:00.627
and assuring Me that you’ll lead a very happy

01:43:00.827 --> 01:43:04.881
and congenial married life.

01:43:05.140 --> 01:43:07.063
I’m sure you can do it.

01:43:07.196 --> 01:43:09.079
It’s not so difficult.

01:43:09.210 --> 01:43:14.890
In Sahaja Yoga you know how to love and how to express love.

01:43:15.130 --> 01:43:18.712
And these marriages are based on Divine love,

01:43:18.912 --> 01:43:21.751
that’s even purer, much higher

01:43:21.982 --> 01:43:24.214
and much more joy-giving.

01:43:24.414 --> 01:43:27.362
So I bless you all
with My, all My heart,

01:43:27.524 --> 01:43:30.299
that you all enjoy
your married life.

01:43:30.436 --> 01:43:32.255
Enjoy is the point.

01:43:32.401 --> 01:43:35.873
If you cannot enjoy your married life, it will be a misery.

01:43:36.073 --> 01:43:38.863
So I want to tell you, whatever is there,

01:43:39.019 --> 01:43:41.667
learn how to enjoy everything.

01:43:41.877 --> 01:43:43.983
That’s the best way you can do it.

01:43:44.183 --> 01:43:47.667
Just now, as you were telling about your names and describing,

01:43:47.867 --> 01:43:51.073
I felt such a collective feeling within you

01:43:51.273 --> 01:43:53.823
to understand each other, appreciate each other,

01:43:54.023 --> 01:43:58.252
and to feel the joy together.

01:43:58.452 --> 01:44:01.214
That’s something great that’s in Sahaja Yoga.

01:44:01.414 --> 01:44:03.708
So may God bless you,

01:44:04.732 --> 01:44:07.458
with all My heart I bless you.
