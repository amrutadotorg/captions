00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:02,601
“What Have You to Surrender?”
(aka “Being Connected to God”), Third Seminar Session,
January 24, 1982, Lonavala, Maharashtra, (India)

2
00:00:02,785 --> 00:00:07,826
Before Realisation whatever you do,
as I told you, before this,

3
00:00:08,025 --> 00:00:10,760
is artificial, towards God,

4
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:12,504
because you are not connected.

5
00:00:12,761 --> 00:00:15,661
Any kind of worship you do, anything you do,

6
00:00:15,848 --> 00:00:20,589
is not really reaching the principle of that.

7
00:00:21,162 --> 00:00:23,412
Now, for example the flame:

8
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:26,445
the principle of flame is light.

9
00:00:27,633 --> 00:00:29,599
And unless until you are awakened,

10
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:31,966
you cannot awaken the principle,

11
00:00:33,129 --> 00:00:35,796
you cannot touch the principle of flame.

12
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:38,423
So, once you are awakened,

13
00:00:38,862 --> 00:00:41,998
then, as you are on your principle,

14
00:00:42,723 --> 00:00:47,496
you can go on the principle of the flame as well.

15
00:00:48,486 --> 00:00:51,520
After Realisation, when you start using the flame,

16
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:56,407
you must have seen that it gives soot,
black soot come out of it sometimes.

17
00:00:56,946 --> 00:00:59,304
I know of somebody who told me that

18
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:03,207
the whole wall became black
when he was putting hand towards me

19
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:06,416
and he was amazed how the wall became black!

20
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:11,406
Then you have seen also that the flame reacts:

21
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:15,190
if my photograph is there

22
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:20,900
then you definitely awaken that flame,

23
00:01:21,096 --> 00:01:23,508
because so many have been cured through my photograph.

24
00:01:24,074 --> 00:01:25,431
How it has happened?

25
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:29,409
What happens is that,

26
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:32,821
when my photograph is placed,

27
00:01:32,954 --> 00:01:35,399
and you put the flame there,

28
00:01:35,652 --> 00:01:37,332
the flame gets awakened,

29
00:01:37,585 --> 00:01:45,492
and the light that passes through that flame
carries the vibrations over.

30
00:01:46,332 --> 00:01:51,582
Material things carry [my vibrations], like sound.

31
00:01:51,724 --> 00:01:53,486
Now sound waves, you have seen that,

32
00:01:53,719 --> 00:01:58,988
I get can clear you out
by touching my different chakras.

33
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:06,409
Like today, I tried to clear you out
on your Hamsa, by touching this mic.

34
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,979
And on the Right Side there was a problem

35
00:02:09,182 --> 00:02:10,715
so then I touched it to the right side.

36
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:13,005
The vibrations were so much that
it was making a sound!

37
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,503
On the left side it was not.

38
00:02:14,848 --> 00:02:19,008
Then the problem of the fear on the Left Side
was just the other way around.

39
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:22,904
So even sound carries the vibrations.

40
00:02:23,392 --> 00:02:24,554
For example, what is a mantra,

41
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:30,947
is nothing but a proper pocket, or you can say
a pot, which carries the vibrations.

42
00:02:31,302 --> 00:02:33,824
But unless until you
are a realised-soul,

43
00:02:33,929 --> 00:02:38,100
you cannot awaken the mantras.

44
00:02:38,622 --> 00:02:42,300
So to say mantras before the Realisation like mad
is wrong.

45
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:49,193
Now doing trataka (त्राटक – fixing eyes on something)
with the photograph, is all right,

46
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:50,611
there’s nothing wrong,

47
00:02:51,077 --> 00:02:54,990
but paying so much attention to one centre
is not necessary.

48
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:02,710
Supposing there’s a photograph

49
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,706
and you are trying to look at the flame
in front of the photograph,

50
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:13,323
then you are paying more attention to the flame
and not to the photograph.

51
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,792
On the contrary if you pay attention to the photograph,

52
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:21,209
the flame puts the light to the photograph,

53
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:23,643
and you get complete vibrations.

54
00:03:25,462 --> 00:03:31,198
Especially for people who suffer,
say, from the Right Side,

55
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:34,714
for them heat is not good so much,

56
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:37,360
because they are already heated up.

57
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:42,190
To such people if they try
to take treatment from heat side,

58
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,305
they won’t be helped.

59
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:51,008
They have to take vibrations from something
that is cold, like water and salt;

60
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:54,707
water and salt helps many people.

61
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:58,478
But some people it may not help also, possibly:

62
00:03:58,676 --> 00:04:06,704
those who have temperament very, very sort
of, we can say, cold types of temperament,

63
00:04:07,525 --> 00:04:08,893
Left-Sided people.

64
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,004
It might not help those people.

65
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:11,816
If they use a warm water it may help.

66
00:04:13,582 --> 00:04:17,594
So, [it] depends on
what sort of personality you are.

67
00:04:18,370 --> 00:04:20,014
For people who are very heated up:

68
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:24,311
one should not take too hot water;
you should take cooler water.

69
00:04:28,389 --> 00:04:29,953
The main thing is that,

70
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:31,730
once you are Realised,

71
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:38,302
then you can touch the principle of everything,
the tattwa, tattwa of everything.

72
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:42,009
Like if you have to treat the tree,

73
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:50,899
you cannot treat individual petals
or individual leaves, even branches.

74
00:04:51,135 --> 00:04:53,709
But what you have to go into is the sap.

75
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,969
And the sap is the principle.

76
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:58,819
Now to get to the sap you have to use the water.

77
00:05:00,623 --> 00:05:04,853
So whatever medicine you have to give to the tree,

78
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,621
what you have to do is to mix it up in the water
[and] pour that water inside

79
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:19,078
so the water inside the sap sucks it
and manifests itself.

80
00:05:19,565 --> 00:05:24,096
In the same way, when you are Realised
you become the principle.

81
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:30,911
In the same way those people
who are supraconscious see colours;

82
00:05:31,488 --> 00:05:40,294
those who are subconscious they see other things,
like dead bodies, bhoots, this that.

83
00:05:45,844 --> 00:05:48,906
Now if you are supraconscious

84
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:52,959
you see something [and] you think that is truth:

85
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:55,781
but you are in that area, that’s why you see.

86
00:05:56,739 --> 00:06:00,095
If you are in the subconscious
you see something that is the bhoot.

87
00:06:00,508 --> 00:06:07,099
But if you are in centre, in the present,
you see nothing, you just feel it.

88
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:09,212
It is effective

89
00:06:10,516 --> 00:06:13,199
because, in the centre,
you are on your principle.

90
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:19,058
But you start seeing
the Kundalini is outside.

91
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:26,609
Some people can even see in the sun’s rays,
you might see even, the vibrations.

92
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,784
Many people can see vibrations

93
00:06:31,353 --> 00:06:34,517
because you have now jumped into your subtle being,

94
00:06:34,652 --> 00:06:36,542
you can see subtle things.

95
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:38,765
And when you use all these things:

96
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:42,585
say, for example, “What is lemon and chilli?”
people might say,

97
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:44,411
because those who do not understand;

98
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:49,676
especially in the West where the mind is so much
conditioned by sophisticated things

99
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:53,917
that they can’t understand
what is [the] sense of putting lemon and chillies.

100
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:56,306
Now lemon has a coefficience.

101
00:06:56,376 --> 00:07:00,627
Now you know that we have cured many people
with lemon and chillies, of their mental problems.

102
00:07:00,663 --> 00:07:02,008
We have seen it.

103
00:07:04,505 --> 00:07:10,706
So we have vibrated lemon and chillies,
and you have got and put them in the water.

104
00:07:12,429 --> 00:07:16,269
Now what happens [is]
the lemon and chillies have a capacity,

105
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,511
have a capacity, to suck my vibrations,

106
00:07:20,343 --> 00:07:25,410
or suck the vibrated water into themselves,
as vibrated ones.

107
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:30,884
They become vibrated themselves,
what is called as jagrut — they become awakened.

108
00:07:31,889 --> 00:07:34,192
So in the night, when you open them,

109
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:37,110
the vibrations travel out

110
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:47,983
and create an atmosphere
in which you start becoming one with your centre,

111
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:53,478
and you lose your left and right side movement

112
00:07:53,689 --> 00:08:00,838
and you become the sane one, you can say,

113
00:08:01,126 --> 00:08:03,470
because you have taken away from the left and right,

114
00:08:03,724 --> 00:08:05,679
and you come in the centre.

115
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:13,986
The question is whether the thing
has got vibrations or not, like this.

116
00:08:18,203 --> 00:08:19,095
What is vibrations?

117
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,161
Is the Brahma.

118
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:27,003
Is the Divine Power of God,
is the Divine Power all around you.

119
00:08:27,321 --> 00:08:32,016
Now this Divine Power is in everything,

120
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:35,848
but is not under your control, as yet;

121
00:08:36,387 --> 00:08:38,067
you have not touched it.

122
00:08:38,806 --> 00:08:41,020
Once you are awakened you touch it,

123
00:08:41,634 --> 00:08:43,797
you awaken that in everything.

124
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:45,700
Once you awaken that,

125
00:08:45,827 --> 00:08:47,914
then you start feeling the vibrations.

126
00:08:48,557 --> 00:08:53,667
Say I have stayed this house, in this place,
even on the seat,

127
00:08:54,445 --> 00:08:58,980
anybody who is sensitive Sahaja Yogi
will know where Mother has put (been).

128
00:09:01,448 --> 00:09:07,009
Certain things have greater capacity
to absorb vibrations.

129
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:14,010
This has been discovered in the ancient times
by many seers.

130
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:21,310
All these techniques that we are using
are not necessarily all mine —

131
00:09:23,324 --> 00:09:28,615
they have been already seen by many ancient seers
who have seen it.

132
00:09:41,423 --> 00:09:44,712
So, you see, to understand Sahaja Yoga,

133
00:09:44,789 --> 00:09:45,617
one has to know

134
00:09:45,714 --> 00:09:51,086
that there is a power, Divine Power,
which acts, which works out.

135
00:09:51,163 --> 00:09:54,572
And now you have become a medium of that power.

136
00:09:54,937 --> 00:09:57,801
That’s how now you have become samartha (समर्थ — powerful).

137
00:09:59,343 --> 00:10:04,601
Samartha also means strong, powerful, independent.

138
00:10:05,766 --> 00:10:09,821
But samartha also means ‘equal to your name’.

139
00:10:17,468 --> 00:10:20,323
So doing anything before Realisation is madness.

140
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,578
After Realisation also,

141
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,202
paying attention to things
from where the vibration is coming, is better.

142
00:10:29,517 --> 00:10:32,113
Moreover, if your Agnya is broken

143
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,180
it’s better to avoid this,

144
00:10:34,965 --> 00:10:36,608
because you have already finished it,

145
00:10:36,978 --> 00:10:40,305
by doing over concentration at a point
where it was not needed.

146
00:10:40,408 --> 00:10:43,308
For example, supposing there is no door here

147
00:10:43,882 --> 00:10:46,149
and I am breaking it all the time,

148
00:10:47,241 --> 00:10:48,590
hitting it with my attention,

149
00:10:49,763 --> 00:10:51,017
the whole thing will collapse!

150
00:10:53,327 --> 00:10:54,687
The door is here.

151
00:10:55,702 --> 00:11:00,696
If you have paid attention in a place
where it doesn’t exist,

152
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:04,763
you have not done justice to yourself.

153
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:07,710
It has to come out from here.

154
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,014
And that is what, it said, that it is spoiled.

155
00:11:15,413 --> 00:11:16,853
It is very simple!

156
00:11:17,937 --> 00:11:19,705
In everyday life you see that way:

157
00:11:19,894 --> 00:11:23,492
a blind man, who doesn’t know the doorway out,

158
00:11:23,744 --> 00:11:25,424
can bang at any place,

159
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,503
may break the wall,

160
00:11:29,668 --> 00:11:31,095
may break himself also!

161
00:11:32,905 --> 00:11:38,298
So after Realisation and before Realisation
there’s a tremendous difference.

162
00:11:38,558 --> 00:11:43,303
One has to understand that
now you are a realised-soul.

163
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:45,917
This assumption you do not have yet.

164
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:48,113
Surrender also, what do you surrender to me?

165
00:11:48,259 --> 00:11:49,404
What do I want out of you?

166
00:11:49,451 --> 00:11:50,092
Nothing!

167
00:11:50,208 --> 00:11:53,107
What do you have to surrender to me?
I just don’t understand.

168
00:11:54,065 --> 00:11:56,786
Surrender you own ego, your own barriers.

169
00:11:57,703 --> 00:12:01,293
What you surrender is your own barrier,

170
00:12:03,756 --> 00:12:05,411
so what is there to surrender?

171
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:07,583
If you have your ego intact,

172
00:12:08,363 --> 00:12:09,894
you won’t work out Sahaja Yoga,

173
00:12:10,076 --> 00:12:11,756
you will be insensitive.

174
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:18,052
Supposing this thing is covered with some sort of cloth
and you cannot see,

175
00:12:18,299 --> 00:12:20,305
then you remove the cloth from it,

176
00:12:20,712 --> 00:12:23,179
will you say it has been surrendered?

177
00:12:23,457 --> 00:12:25,627
This ‘surrender’ word itself is very treacherous

178
00:12:25,683 --> 00:12:27,817
because that immediately acts on your ego.

179
00:12:27,982 --> 00:12:30,293
Actually, surrender means surrender your ego.

180
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:32,631
But when somebody says,
“You must surrender to Mataji!”

181
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:35,352
that means you think that
you have to surrender your money!

182
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:38,704
What is there in money?
I don’t want your money.

183
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:43,249
What is there to surrender to me?

184
00:12:44,155 --> 00:12:45,491
I mean just imagine!

185
00:12:45,614 --> 00:12:46,676
What are you going to give to me?

186
00:12:46,701 --> 00:12:48,419
I have nothing to get from you!

187
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:51,295
Is that there anything that I can get from you?

188
00:12:51,523 --> 00:12:52,523
Nothing!

189
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:58,000
Luckily this time, even in this lifetime,

190
00:12:59,481 --> 00:13:04,500
I’m born in such way, in such family,
that I don’t need anything.

191
00:13:05,219 --> 00:13:10,817
I have even got paid and a position in that,
so even that I don’t need!

192
00:13:11,142 --> 00:13:13,112
What is there to surrender to me?

193
00:13:16,132 --> 00:13:20,196
You have to surrender your own ego, that’s all,

194
00:13:21,149 --> 00:13:24,996
and you will feel free with that,
because you are bound by your own ego.

195
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:32,908
Supposing you are in the shackles of chains,
you are chained:

196
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,006
now if you want to remove the chains,
are you surrendering those chains?

197
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,145
What you are surrendering

198
00:13:40,262 --> 00:13:49,089
is your own inhibitions, your own problems,
your own shackles,

199
00:13:50,554 --> 00:13:52,615
which do not give you freedom;

200
00:13:55,521 --> 00:14:01,408
your chains, your conditionings, your diseases, your troubles —

201
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:03,406
that’s what you have surrendered.

202
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07,264
What is there to surrender?

203
00:14:07,312 --> 00:14:08,969
I just don’t understand.

204
00:14:09,513 --> 00:14:14,923
Just to remove the clouds
which are over your Spirit,

205
00:14:16,853 --> 00:14:21,601
you have to make Kundalini
rise with a great force

206
00:14:21,998 --> 00:14:24,101
so that they are all thrown away.

207
00:14:25,439 --> 00:14:30,409
I don’t know how you people have a misconception
that you must surrender to Mother.

208
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:31,369
What?

209
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:37,012
Your negativity, your negative thinking,
all this must be surrendered.

210
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:45,163
But I mean, imagine I having all your negativity,
all your burnings and all your heat.

211
00:14:45,188 --> 00:14:50,400
I mean, some people who touch my feet
really burn my feet, I tell you! Really! Horrible!

212
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:56,700
It’s not easy to take everybody on my feet.

213
00:14:57,208 --> 00:15:00,463
I mean, even people who had leprosy,
who had this,

214
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,474
they all touched my feet,

215
00:15:01,508 --> 00:15:03,498
the other day when I was in America.

216
00:15:03,984 --> 00:15:06,078
All kinds of people touched my feet.

217
00:15:06,713 --> 00:15:10,489
And they would think that,
“We are surrendering our leprosy to Mother!”

218
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,511
It is like that!

219
00:15:14,678 --> 00:15:19,862
For an ego-orientated person
it’s very easy to jump onto such conclusions.

220
00:15:20,307 --> 00:15:22,753
So you are surrendering nothing!

221
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,906
Whichever is valuable you cannot surrender.

222
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:30,967
So, Indians, when they surrender,
they know what to do.

223
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:34,374
But for a western mind
it is very difficult to understand surrendering.

224
00:15:35,051 --> 00:15:36,441
So far they have know gurus

225
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:41,538
where they have surrendered their money, their wives, their children, everything!

226
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:47,380
So they don’t understand
surrender in Sahja Yoga, what does it mean.

227
00:15:52,139 --> 00:15:56,875
That means you have to become your principle
and give up all that is gross.

228
00:15:57,684 --> 00:15:59,502
But don’t give it to Guru!

229
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:02,212
Your gross should be thrown away.

230
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:05,331
The Guru doesn’t want any gross from you, nothing.

231
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:11,347
It is said, Buddha said it I think, they say so,
I don’t know if he would have said it

232
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:15,879
that, you must give all your tana, mana, dhana
(तना, body, मन mind, धन wealth) to your guru.

233
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:20,170
I have said it at that time.

234
00:16:21,122 --> 00:16:23,118
But not in Sahaja Yoga.

235
00:16:23,293 --> 00:16:26,519
As I already told you,
you sacrifice nothing whatsoever.

236
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:29,328
I mean on the contrary even on a material basis,

237
00:16:29,582 --> 00:16:38,123
say traveling in India, it’s the cheapest by Sahaja Yog —
cheaper by the dozen! (laughter)

238
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:40,721
It cannot cheaper than this.

239
00:16:41,372 --> 00:16:45,926
So, this is what one has to understand,
that you want to become the Spirit.

240
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:52,762
And the Spirit means, the essence is that, you,
the principle that is you.

241
00:16:53,314 --> 00:16:56,313
You become the principle,
you touch every principle

242
00:16:56,401 --> 00:16:58,840
and that’s why everything has a meaning.

243
00:16:59,099 --> 00:17:03,317
Now in the book,
many people might have done that way,

244
00:17:04,122 --> 00:17:05,044
so they will not like it.

245
00:17:05,084 --> 00:17:06,600
If I tell them they will not like it.

246
00:17:06,703 --> 00:17:09,314
You see it’s a very funny reaction human beings have:

247
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:11,319
if you are doing something wrong

248
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,319
[and] if you tell them, “Don’t do it!”

249
00:17:15,450 --> 00:17:22,251
then they will say that, “Why Mother said so?”

250
00:17:22,343 --> 00:17:23,648
I mean have to tell you!

251
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,196
After all you have come to me to ask the truth,

252
00:17:26,402 --> 00:17:28,088
so I have to tell you the truth.

253
00:17:29,065 --> 00:17:31,494
It is for your good only.

254
00:17:33,884 --> 00:17:37,487
Like yesterday I meet somebody
who was wearing three, four things in neck.

255
00:17:38,126 --> 00:17:40,054
He said, “I have high blood pressure.”

256
00:17:40,098 --> 00:17:43,114
I said, “All right.
For you a particular thing is all right.

257
00:17:43,223 --> 00:17:45,609
But all other things are no good.
You take it out!”

258
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:48,796
He said, “Yes, yes. I’ll take out everything you say
because I want get well.”

259
00:17:49,042 --> 00:17:56,511
This is what is. It’s so simple that
whatever is not good for you, I tell you.

260
00:17:57,178 --> 00:18:01,186
I am not here seeking elections,
that I should try to please you.

261
00:18:01,676 --> 00:18:11,698
I am here to comfort you, to help you,
and to give you counsel and to redeem you.

262
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:16,599
How am I to do it when you come to tell me that,

263
00:18:16,874 --> 00:18:22,325
“This is wrong with a certain guru,
he has looted you, he has done this, that.”

264
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,301
That’s how I have come to know about gurus also.

265
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,551
But somebody’s still sticking onto that guru,

266
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:30,548
when he comes to me, I tell that person that,

267
00:18:30,715 --> 00:18:34,539
“See, other people are saying about this,
you better be careful.”

268
00:18:35,193 --> 00:18:37,318
He feels very hurt!

269
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:41,576
And then when he’s hurt himself
later on with that guru,

270
00:18:41,814 --> 00:18:43,592
he comes back to me!

271
00:18:44,878 --> 00:18:49,490
My job is to warn you about all these people,
what they are doing.

272
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:56,744
If there is a real guru,
I would say there is a real guru.

273
00:18:57,014 --> 00:18:59,851
But as I said, in Sahaj Yoga,
you don’t have to have any guru,

274
00:18:59,876 --> 00:19:02,276
because you your self becomes gurus.

275
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:09,437
Gurus were required when we had to maintain our dharma,
when we had to maintain our balance.

276
00:19:09,790 --> 00:19:12,824
We needed it to tell us that,
“This is true, that is true.”

277
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:15,765
In those days gurus are useless, absolutely useless.

278
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,718
As it is gurus never treated with reverence, real gurus.

279
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:21,186
They were never treated with reverence.

280
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,925
Nobody listened to them.

281
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:29,444
They didn’t come to give you Realisation,
they came to establish you in your dharma.

282
00:19:30,141 --> 00:19:32,507
They didn’t have to give you Realisation at all.

283
00:19:32,662 --> 00:19:36,472
Like Guru Nanaka, whatever he said was the truth:

284
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:41,020
just to establish you in dharma,
so that you get your Realisation later.

285
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:44,881
But people make a cult out of that.

286
00:19:45,182 --> 00:19:48,421
Everything is made just [a cult] —
that’s not the thing.

287
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:50,909
Guru is needed just to establish your dharma.

288
00:19:51,006 --> 00:19:53,330
But after Realisation you become the guru.

289
00:19:53,708 --> 00:20:00,556
That doesn’t mean you through disrespect in anyway to gurus
like Guru Nanaka and all this who are Sat Gurus.

290
00:20:01,418 --> 00:20:03,980
At their time, they were very much needed.

291
00:20:04,807 --> 00:20:10,088
If they were not there,
there would have no talk of principles of dharma.

292
00:20:10,434 --> 00:20:11,092
They were needed.

293
00:20:11,138 --> 00:20:15,738
Today you are Realised, you have become the guru.

294
00:20:16,107 --> 00:20:17,311
So you [should] talk of them also.

295
00:20:17,358 --> 00:20:21,518
But if you talk of them to anyone,
that person can go against you,

296
00:20:22,775 --> 00:20:26,994
if he is adharmic, he’ll not like if you tell him,
“Don’t do like this, don’t do like that!”

297
00:20:27,391 --> 00:20:29,609
It’s a very funny world.

298
00:20:30,587 --> 00:20:32,519
For Sahaj Yogis, you must understand that

299
00:20:32,551 --> 00:20:37,023
the task is very heavy and
you have to work it out with your discretion.

300
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:42,091
If you want spread Sahaj Yoga,

301
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:45,069
you have to be very, very careful with it,

302
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,797
because negativity is too much.

303
00:20:51,404 --> 00:20:54,070
And it is required that you should know,

304
00:20:54,386 --> 00:20:57,301
how negativity works and acts on you.

305
00:20:58,624 --> 00:20:59,790
If there is any problem,

306
00:20:59,907 --> 00:21:03,488
you should let me know
what is the problem you have got or anything.

307
00:21:03,671 --> 00:21:08,325
But be direct and be simple about it.

308
00:21:09,370 --> 00:21:13,082
If you try to be cunning,
you will be the losers, isn’t it?

309
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,615
So be direct.

310
00:21:15,930 --> 00:21:21,492
Tell me, “This is problem,”
and then try, and act [upon] what I say.

311
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:25,835
It’s a free consultation given.

312
00:21:31,798 --> 00:21:39,775
So one has to assume, one has to believe
that you are realised-souls.

313
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:42,518
This also when I say, people think that,

314
00:21:42,592 --> 00:21:46,078
“Mother is just forcing this idea into us!
It is auto-suggestion.”

315
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,098
Because I don’t know what to do sometimes.

316
00:21:50,899 --> 00:21:55,201
When they get Realisation,
they don’t want to believe they are realised-souls.

317
00:21:56,439 --> 00:21:59,419
Still they go on behaving in a way
as if they are not realised.

318
00:21:59,614 --> 00:22:01,491
Then I have to tell them, “You are realised-soul!”

319
00:22:01,673 --> 00:22:03,320
Now, know that you are realised-soul.

320
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,986
Assume your powers as realised-souls.

321
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:08,995
See if it acts or not or works it out or not.

322
00:22:09,521 --> 00:22:14,980
Once you have assumed that you are realised-soul,
immediately you will become responsible, I know that.

323
00:22:15,246 --> 00:22:25,996
But this assumption is very difficult:
that you are the essential of all the essences.

324
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:32,484
If this is assumed within you,
I don’t have to tell you anything, I tell you,

325
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:33,926
because once you know you are a guru,

326
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,800
you will become responsible,

327
00:22:36,004 --> 00:22:38,616
you will see your own ego,
you will try to correct it.

328
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:41,803
But if you come ask me,
I’ll have to tell you that,

329
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:44,830
“This may be the reason.
That is the reason. [It’s] because of that.”

330
00:22:45,723 --> 00:22:48,623
I mean in Sahaj Yoga everything has a reason.

331
00:22:49,144 --> 00:22:50,900
But, of course, as you know,

332
00:22:51,133 --> 00:22:55,549
we allow very few people come in to the inner circle,
very few people.

333
00:22:55,705 --> 00:22:59,430
I mean, as it is
we don’t allow everybody come for puja,

334
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:02,391
because those who don’t understand, don’t understand.

335
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:04,970
They jump back.

336
00:23:05,849 --> 00:23:09,617
Puja is more understood by Indians
than by the Western people also.

337
00:23:10,038 --> 00:23:17,209
But gradually, when they feel the effects of puja,
they want it, because it has an effect on them.

338
00:23:17,344 --> 00:23:18,709
It acts on you.

339
00:23:18,819 --> 00:23:23,404
Ninety-nine percent of people do feel,

340
00:23:23,927 --> 00:23:28,459
but one percent could be such that
they will act according to their egos.

341
00:23:28,524 --> 00:23:31,702
They may not accept anything, they react.

342
00:23:31,988 --> 00:23:33,912
So, in England we are very particular,

343
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:36,289
but still some people creep in.

344
00:23:39,630 --> 00:23:43,118
Now questions and answers were very good.

345
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:48,527
I liked the way they were asked, answers were given.

346
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:55,695
But the best way to learn Sahaj yoga
is practical side of it — just like science.

347
00:23:56,824 --> 00:24:02,500
You must practice Sahaj Yoga:
practice on yourself and practice on others.

348
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:04,865
And be a witness to it.

349
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,703
These are the three things, if you do,

350
00:24:09,178 --> 00:24:11,119
you will spread Sahaj Yoga better,

351
00:24:11,505 --> 00:24:13,902
you will grow better
and will understand Sahaj Yoga better.

352
00:24:14,182 --> 00:24:19,601
There are so many things that happen,
that cannot be explained.

353
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:23,892
For example, a gentleman came and told me,

354
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:31,778
that, “The lady whom you have cured of cancer,
has now got pain in her kidneys.”

355
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:38,127
The moment he told, the lady felt better
and she got cured, that person.

356
00:24:38,270 --> 00:24:41,490
And she was not there, when he told me.

357
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:44,006
Now, how it has worked out?

358
00:24:44,209 --> 00:24:45,138
How am I to explain this?

359
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:46,193
It’s impossible!

360
00:24:46,227 --> 00:24:47,907
I cannot explain to you.

361
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,384
Because human beings think that
everything is under their own understanding,
is a wrong thing.

362
00:24:53,478 --> 00:24:56,486
You can’t understand God and His ways. Can you?

363
00:24:57,158 --> 00:25:00,166
The only one thing one can do is to become one.

364
00:25:01,678 --> 00:25:05,115
Because you have a limited intellect.

365
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:07,627
You can’t understand everything of Sahaj Yoga.

366
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:11,211
You can’t understand how, under your hands,
the Kundalini is moving.

367
00:25:11,549 --> 00:25:13,393
The how of nothing can be explained.

368
00:25:13,613 --> 00:25:19,032
That’s why I said, “Throw away ‘how’ in the sea!”
Because you cannot explain!

369
00:25:19,108 --> 00:25:24,366
Can you explain, why is it, when you raise the Kundalini,
it rises, and you can feel the chakras.

370
00:25:24,605 --> 00:25:28,559
Can you say how all of you feel the same centre?

371
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,985
In God’s realm it has so many dimensions.

372
00:25:44,188 --> 00:25:46,121
It has such tremendous speed.

373
00:25:48,178 --> 00:25:50,418
It is so effective.

374
00:25:50,863 --> 00:25:52,863
The attention is so effective.

375
00:25:53,606 --> 00:25:56,808
You bring something to the attention
and immediately it acts.

376
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,804
And when she got cured, I went to her house,

377
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:04,399
and I didn’t know what to do,

378
00:26:04,434 --> 00:26:08,820
because [it was] very embarrassing that I told.

379
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,257
She said, “Why did I get it Mother?”

380
00:26:10,316 --> 00:26:14,888
I said, “You didn’t even write a letter of thanks to me.
At least a letter of thanks to God!”

381
00:26:15,259 --> 00:26:16,813
After all you must thank God.

382
00:26:16,994 --> 00:26:20,678
If you think that, “God has cured me so what?”
it’s not so.

383
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:25,746
You have to be humble about it.

384
00:26:26,003 --> 00:26:28,896
At least a letter of thanks she should have sent to me.

385
00:26:29,227 --> 00:26:33,202
And that’s how she got out of my attention completely.

386
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:35,972
I mean don’t do any harm to her,

387
00:26:36,051 --> 00:26:38,781
but she herself jumps into such things.

388
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:44,627
And when she got out of my attention,
she got this trouble.

389
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:45,961
Still she argued with me,

390
00:26:45,988 --> 00:26:51,279
“No, no. I didn’t want to write, because I was thinking
that I was cured by doctors.” this thing, that thing.

391
00:26:51,349 --> 00:26:53,513
I said, “All right, go ahead with it!”

392
00:26:53,906 --> 00:26:57,582
She wouldn’t even write a letter of thanks,
can you imagine!

393
00:26:58,742 --> 00:27:02,322
And then she got back her cancer.

394
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:04,833
So a letter comes back to me,

395
00:27:04,968 --> 00:27:11,060
saying that, “Mother now she is writing
a letter of thanks to you.” (laughing)

396
00:27:13,411 --> 00:27:18,585
What am I to do? Isn’t it stupid?

397
00:27:20,452 --> 00:27:23,990
But it can be very serious!
It’s very stupid but very serious.

398
00:27:24,198 --> 00:27:28,721
You shouldn’t play with the Divine Power.
It’s very dangerous.

399
00:27:28,975 --> 00:27:33,539
Like one journalist, who
wrote something against me

400
00:27:33,603 --> 00:27:38,426
and people were very furious,
very, very furious with him.

401
00:27:38,586 --> 00:27:41,341
Everybody was angry with him,
I said, “Forget it!”

402
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:44,030
And now he’s got blood cancer.

403
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,126
He sold his house.

404
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:50,459
It was again published in the same newspaper
[that] he’s got blood cancer! (laughing).

405
00:27:51,090 --> 00:27:51,738
I don’t know what to say!

406
00:27:51,791 --> 00:27:53,801
He’s sold his house.

407
00:27:56,270 --> 00:28:00,579
They told me that he sold his house and everything

408
00:28:00,841 --> 00:28:05,541
and he’s now going to America,
and his wife is now come to Sahaj Yoga.

409
00:28:06,268 --> 00:28:07,948
Why go that long way?

410
00:28:08,430 --> 00:28:13,009
If you forget God, God doesn’t forget you.

411
00:28:13,771 --> 00:28:16,132
But if you forget Him,

412
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:22,013
you get out of his attention,
and you go to something that is dangerous.

413
00:28:23,961 --> 00:28:27,532
You can see all this in Sahaja Yoga:

414
00:28:27,913 --> 00:28:31,684
those who have done like this,
gone out of the attention, have suffered.

415
00:28:31,863 --> 00:28:33,682
Not that God wants you to suffer,

416
00:28:33,761 --> 00:28:38,402
but, if there is light
you can see everything clearly.

417
00:28:38,751 --> 00:28:40,018
But when you go out of the light,

418
00:28:40,074 --> 00:28:43,078
you fall in a ditch, and you say,
“Why didn’t the light follow me?”

419
00:28:46,927 --> 00:28:50,526
It’s very stupid!
The whole thing is very stupid.

420
00:28:55,658 --> 00:28:56,991
When you surrender your ego,

421
00:28:57,092 --> 00:29:03,234
you realise that you are just
a part and parcel of the whole,

422
00:29:04,612 --> 00:29:07,226
and you are only are important
because you have become awakened;

423
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,019
otherwise you are not important.

424
00:29:14,305 --> 00:29:27,695
All these things add up to a kind of a negativity
which gives you barrier to take Realisation.

425
00:29:28,944 --> 00:29:31,739
Take to your assumption
that you are a realised-soul.

426
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:40,493
In a very simple way, now you have jumped in the sea,
that’s all — you have become the sea!

427
00:29:42,468 --> 00:29:50,306
What is there to give to Mother or to surrender —
[this is the] first point you should ask your Mr. Ego.

428
00:29:52,009 --> 00:29:54,276
“I myself is a problem to myself.”

429
00:29:55,344 --> 00:30:00,508
“If She is solving my problem,
She is taking up my problems to Herself,

430
00:30:01,130 --> 00:30:03,596
what am I going to surrender to Her?”

431
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:19,201
I mean you are so, sometimes, in the grip of the ego
that I don’t even try my tricks to test you,

432
00:30:19,465 --> 00:30:23,368
because you are so premature,
you are so sensitive still.

433
00:30:23,392 --> 00:30:25,459
I mean I don’t know what to do.

434
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:29,808
You are to be tested, but even that I don’t do.

435
00:30:30,376 --> 00:30:32,120
No testing, direct.

436
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:36,395
Some testing is needed.

437
00:30:37,237 --> 00:30:42,091
After all if you have to enter to the Kingdom of God,
you have to be tested, no doubt.

438
00:30:42,621 --> 00:30:47,496
You also know that, those who are realised,
that many centres you catch.

439
00:30:47,863 --> 00:30:53,627
You jump upon your ego and superego all the time,
you have problems, still doesn’t matter.

440
00:30:53,792 --> 00:30:59,603
Even if you have fifth-had car Sahaja Yoga accepts you.

441
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:10,182
Actually it Sahaja Yoga which is accepting all of you,
which is rendering all the help necessary.

442
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:13,657
We have to be thankful to Sahaja Yoga,

443
00:31:14,162 --> 00:31:20,005
that it has brought such relief to all of us.
It’s such a relief.

444
00:31:20,315 --> 00:31:23,132
So one has to first assume
that you are realised-soul.

445
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:24,804
That is the assumption you don’t have.

446
00:31:24,957 --> 00:31:27,466
And when you have that assumption
you think that you are realised-soul

447
00:31:27,522 --> 00:31:31,234
so you should shout at people,
and get angry and show off.

448
00:31:34,073 --> 00:31:36,915
Or you think you should extract money from Sahaja Yogis,

449
00:31:37,928 --> 00:31:49,814
you should try to take away sort of
like a businessman, something out of them.

450
00:31:50,213 --> 00:31:52,807
Or you should try to save money
at the cost of Sahaj Yoga.

451
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:56,594
I mean this is absurd,
all these things are absurd.

452
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:03,258
The absurdity is that you have come to gain something,

453
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,233
you have come to the River Ganges
to fill your pitchers — all right, fill it up.

454
00:32:09,625 --> 00:32:11,305
You fill up the water.

455
00:32:14,844 --> 00:32:19,492
But when you fill up the water,

456
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:23,302
you are going to use it for some purpose.

457
00:32:24,091 --> 00:32:27,572
Now, know that there is The Ganges within you.

458
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:32,711
Assume it! Again and again I say to you,
that you assume it.

459
00:32:33,528 --> 00:32:38,847
The assumption will give you
whatever qualities are needed for the Spirit.

460
00:32:40,614 --> 00:32:45,862
You don’t need much of technique
as I told you this morning, not much of technique.

461
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:55,151
What is needed is love, looking at things with love.

462
00:32:56,012 --> 00:32:57,310
If you are kind to someone,

463
00:32:57,449 --> 00:33:00,107
is it out of love or out of sympathy,

464
00:33:00,685 --> 00:33:06,167
or is it out of some sort of a power lust attitude,

465
00:33:06,238 --> 00:33:11,193
or is it out some sort of gain
that you want to get out of it.

466
00:33:11,812 --> 00:33:17,925
If your behaviour outside is artificial,
it is also of no use.

467
00:33:18,499 --> 00:33:20,211
So try to train yourself up that,

468
00:33:20,298 --> 00:33:23,488
“Now I have come to Sahaj Yoga
I have to train myself!”

469
00:33:23,949 --> 00:33:25,929
It’s a very big training centre:

470
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,754
in you spiritual life, in your social life,
in your physical life, in your mental life.

471
00:33:34,453 --> 00:33:38,866
You have to cleanse your mind itself,
where the wrong things are coming from.

472
00:33:42,165 --> 00:33:46,005
You can cleanse
because your attention is now enlightened.

473
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:53,390
Just start looking at yourself,
“What kind of thought [is] there coming into my mind?”

474
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,826
And then once you have cleansed yourself

475
00:34:00,662 --> 00:34:03,696
you will feel your purity.
You will be very happy.

476
00:34:16,966 --> 00:34:20,803
Sahaja Yogis are my own children,

477
00:34:21,609 --> 00:34:24,244
they have got their own powers,

478
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:27,292
they have got it, because they have got it.

479
00:34:27,752 --> 00:34:29,701
Nobody need be jealous of them.

480
00:34:30,089 --> 00:34:31,510
Everybody can get it.

481
00:34:32,705 --> 00:34:35,134
God wants it to happen, it has happened.

482
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:38,634
It is all prophesised that it is going to happen.

483
00:34:39,292 --> 00:34:43,709
But if you don’t understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga…

484
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:47,944
because if you judge from the gross angle
you cannot understand Sahaj Yoga.

485
00:34:50,615 --> 00:34:54,404
You have to know you have become a subtler being
and everything is on a subtle level;

486
00:34:54,694 --> 00:34:57,791
as I said in the morning only,
that you have become sukshma now.

487
00:34:58,024 --> 00:34:59,624
You have become now.

488
00:35:00,092 --> 00:35:02,723
You are different person.
You are not the same person.

489
00:35:03,024 --> 00:35:06,195
As the egg has become the bird,
it’s a different thing altogether.

490
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:12,218
Take out all that was before — that,
if you call ‘surrender’, all right!

491
00:35:14,361 --> 00:35:19,412
and assume your own powers,
to become very powerful yourself.

492
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:35,210
Now if there are any other questions
you ask me. Ask me.

493
00:35:40,226 --> 00:35:44,617
(In Marathi: You should all learn English.

494
00:35:45,028 --> 00:35:48,013
Your Mother has learned so you should also learn.

495
00:35:48,589 --> 00:35:50,785
Now the God understands English!

496
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:55,309
I understand, that means that God understands!)

497
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:58,719
Yogis: Mother, can I ask a question.

498
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:02,890
Today I was asked the following question
I didn’t know how to answer that.

499
00:36:03,679 --> 00:36:15,194
The person which usually feels very well in the fingers,
didn’t have ego finger burning, yet couldn’t surrender.

500
00:36:16,796 --> 00:36:26,006
So what is the position of not being capable of surrender,
fighting to surrender, yet the finger was not burning.

501
00:36:26,315 --> 00:36:30,100
Shri Mataji: The reason is stupidity,
is absolutely stupidity.

502
00:36:30,364 --> 00:36:31,796
I mean how can you explain this?

503
00:36:31,915 --> 00:36:35,818
You see, you are feeling the cool breeze in the hand,
you are feeling all right,

504
00:36:36,158 --> 00:36:37,859
still you are saying, “I am not going to surrender!”

505
00:36:37,938 --> 00:36:43,309
Must be some sort of a bull.
I mean you just see!

506
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:45,108
How do you explain such a person?

507
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:49,202
That person is not honest, [is] dishonest in simple words.

508
00:36:49,977 --> 00:36:53,716
Even if you are feeling the cool breeze
in the hand, you are feeling better,

509
00:36:53,843 --> 00:36:57,816
you are feeling the vibrations as promised by Adi Shankrachaya,

510
00:36:58,001 --> 00:37:02,276
everything you see, and also you
read Blake and you see all that,

511
00:37:02,406 --> 00:37:03,489
[and] still you don’t want to believe it,

512
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:07,091
that means you are stupid, you are just like a bull.

513
00:37:07,634 --> 00:37:14,063
Here a bull, is all right, healthy,
is perfectly in good condition

514
00:37:14,234 --> 00:37:18,510
and just sits on the street.

515
00:37:20,168 --> 00:37:22,811
And you ask him, “Why sir, why are you sitting on the street?”

516
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:25,508
And he says, “I don’t want to surrender!”

517
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:27,551
“Baba you are all right?

518
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:29,807
What is matter with you?

519
00:37:29,924 --> 00:37:30,767
Why are you sitting here?”

520
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:35,284
“No, I don’t want to surrender myself
to all the other traffic! I want sit here.”

521
00:37:36,938 --> 00:37:38,309
“But why?”

522
00:37:39,224 --> 00:37:44,905
Then there is a method (laughter).

523
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:52,386
For such stupid people there is method for that!

524
00:37:52,521 --> 00:37:55,609
And then they run! (laughter)

525
00:37:56,016 --> 00:37:57,219
This is absolute stupid!

526
00:37:57,311 --> 00:38:01,009
There’s nothing more than that
[which] can be said about a person like that!

527
00:38:01,131 --> 00:38:03,211
He doesn’t want to surrender, means what?

528
00:38:03,534 --> 00:38:06,116
What is he not wanting to do?

529
00:38:07,325 --> 00:38:10,108
I mean as surrender what do you do?
Just think about it.

530
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:14,290
Then you tell them, you surrender, you surrender.
(break in recording)

531
00:38:14,483 --> 00:38:18,691
Such a person is possessed
and the possession comes back on the person.

532
00:38:19,148 --> 00:38:22,712
For a while it is all right
and then again there’s a possession which gives it ideas.

533
00:38:22,764 --> 00:38:24,017
Again it’s all right.

534
00:38:24,113 --> 00:38:26,117
It’s a wobbly character, that’s all we can say.

535
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,895
It’s a very wobbly character.

536
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:32,135
And one should take oneself to task
for such a nonsensical thing.

537
00:38:32,903 --> 00:38:35,604
I mean, just think of it.

538
00:38:37,592 --> 00:38:42,010
Such behaviour is possible before Realisation.

539
00:38:42,373 --> 00:38:47,190
After Realisation, once you have felt something,
what is it?

540
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:52,903
It’s stupidity, absolute stupidity.

541
00:38:53,007 --> 00:38:55,177
Trying to show off, you can say, at the most.

542
00:38:55,361 --> 00:38:58,094
Such a person is just trying to show off,

543
00:38:58,472 --> 00:39:00,209
like a bull sitting on the street

544
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:04,054
is trying to show off,
“Every traffic is waiting for me!”

545
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,512
He’s feeling very happy about it.

546
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:07,905
It has a nuisance value.

547
00:39:08,607 --> 00:39:11,401
Such people are nothing but they are a nuisance value!

548
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:14,496
They are nothing but a nuisance value.
They are a nuisance.

549
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:21,404
By creating a nuisance, like in
England we have now these punk rocks —

550
00:39:21,689 --> 00:39:23,031
what do they achieve?

551
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:28,614
Just create a disharmony,
a stupid feeling and a repulsion, that’s all.

552
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,424
They just do it because, you see,

553
00:39:31,737 --> 00:39:35,077
if they feel they are neglected sometimes,
they do like this.

554
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,719
Then they create a nuisance out of them[selves].

555
00:39:37,856 --> 00:39:40,756
So everybody pays attention to such a person.

556
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,721
The best way is to neglect that!

557
00:39:44,228 --> 00:39:46,706
That is the best way is to neglect such people
who talk like this,

558
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:51,280
then they will not have to surrender
and take two running jumps and go to hell!

559
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:55,497
Then they are all right.

560
00:39:55,716 --> 00:39:57,649
Don’t fuss about such people.

561
00:39:57,871 --> 00:39:58,918
They are fussy people.

562
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,238
They want to fuss about themselves.

563
00:40:00,302 --> 00:40:02,296
They want everybody to fuss about them.

564
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,748
We should say, “You better spare Sahaj Yoga and us!”

565
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:13,476
Yogi: Why the perfect God Mother,
this is a question they asked me, many people,

566
00:40:13,678 --> 00:40:16,686
why the perfect God created the imperfect world

567
00:40:16,993 --> 00:40:22,012
and why so many people don’t have even the seeking
and they are going in the opposite direction?

568
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:28,812
Shri Mataji: You ask the people.
(break in recording)

569
00:40:33,105 --> 00:40:36,506
Everyone! French should learn English!

570
00:40:37,216 --> 00:40:39,084
If you try to learn, it’s not difficult.

571
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,931
If Indians can learn English why can’t you.

572
00:40:40,988 --> 00:40:42,918
Your Mother can’t speak French.

573
00:40:43,124 --> 00:40:44,191
It’s a very difficult language.

574
00:40:44,310 --> 00:40:52,214
You have to turn your tongue so much
that my Vishuddhi goes out of order.

575
00:40:53,535 --> 00:40:54,499
I can’t speak.

576
00:40:54,749 --> 00:40:57,220
I have tried to say your way,
but I just can’t say.

577
00:40:59,470 --> 00:41:00,830
I tried, you see.

578
00:41:01,589 --> 00:41:04,108
So it’s better you learn English language.

579
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:06,289
It’s not difficult for you.

580
00:41:07,103 --> 00:41:12,317
Most of the English words which are subtle
are borrowed from French!

581
00:41:13,742 --> 00:41:20,691
(Mother demonstrates a few words
similar between English and French)

582
00:41:28,318 --> 00:41:35,707
Now ‘Vincent’ everybody says, ‘Vincent’,
but you will say, ’Vanson’.

583
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,669
You see, this is individualism.

584
00:41:40,153 --> 00:41:41,728
Now we have become collective,

585
00:41:41,943 --> 00:41:45,207
try to learn a language which everyone understands.

586
00:41:46,033 --> 00:41:49,117
It’s not difficult
for French people to learn English words.

587
00:41:49,627 --> 00:41:53,213
Indians are very good at languages I tell you.

588
00:41:53,592 --> 00:41:55,659
They are the best in languages.

589
00:41:56,957 --> 00:42:01,757
If they want they can learn any language
so they should have no compunction.

590
00:42:02,535 --> 00:42:08,118
Should try to learn three languages,
as much as that you could follow me.

591
00:42:10,297 --> 00:42:17,902
Of course you can’t understand Hindi and Marathi so much
as you can understand English.

592
00:42:18,361 --> 00:42:20,203
So try at least.

593
00:42:20,544 --> 00:42:25,583
But that doesn’t mean that those who know English
should not know any other language!

594
00:42:25,805 --> 00:42:29,837
Like our Hindi speaking people,
they never try to learn any other language,

595
00:42:29,870 --> 00:42:32,814
because everybody has to speak Hindi language.

596
00:42:34,844 --> 00:42:41,517
So those who are not well versed in other languages
should try to learn other languages.

597
00:42:41,758 --> 00:42:44,558
You must learn some language in Sahaja Yoga.

598
00:42:45,238 --> 00:42:49,773
Say you may learn Sanskrit, you may learn Hindi, Marathi.

599
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:53,615
If you know English,
that is not sufficient in Sahaja Yoga.

600
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:56,505
You have to talk to other people also.

601
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:02,485
If you really want to be effective
you have to know something.

602
00:43:05,173 --> 00:43:11,220
You will help me a lot if you know French,
because in France [when] I go, I get lost.

603
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:13,901
In Spain [when] I go I get lost.

604
00:43:14,421 --> 00:43:20,889
We went to Spain and we had taken one lady with us
who was going to translate me

605
00:43:21,342 --> 00:43:26,291
and she got nervous
and I didn’t know how to talk to people.

606
00:43:26,728 --> 00:43:29,908
Then suddenly somebody came up
and he said, “I would like to translate you.”

607
00:43:36,924 --> 00:43:41,917
It is not difficult for Sahaja Yogis to do anything

608
00:43:42,496 --> 00:43:44,202
because they become so dynamic.

609
00:43:44,417 --> 00:43:46,024
If they get to it, they can do it.

610
00:43:46,268 --> 00:43:47,094
It’s very simple.

611
00:43:47,154 --> 00:43:51,803
So just think that you have to know
about other languages also,

612
00:43:52,065 --> 00:43:54,680
like Australians know only English, that’s not good.

613
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:58,097
They must know one more language,
at least one more language.

614
00:43:58,522 --> 00:44:03,204
And for that they should try to get somebody
to teach them one more language.

615
00:44:03,964 --> 00:44:06,205
At least two languages you must know.

616
00:44:09,944 --> 00:44:12,672
I mean [if] you want to become
universal and stick onto one language,

617
00:44:12,743 --> 00:44:14,292
how will you become universal?

618
00:44:14,665 --> 00:44:17,465
Those who join maybe have to know English.

619
00:44:17,831 --> 00:44:19,837
Japanese also have to know English.

620
00:44:19,979 --> 00:44:24,497
I know this definitely, they have to know English,
because all naval terminologies are in English.

621
00:44:24,583 --> 00:44:31,397
Those who join airways, they have to know English
because everything is translated in English.

622
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:43,362
Any other thing which is doing
a universal work or manifestation,

623
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:46,601
they have to know English, it is important.

624
00:44:47,373 --> 00:44:48,988
So this will not be a waste.

625
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:57,544
But in no way I would say that English language
is that perfect to describe Sahaja Yoga, in no way.

626
00:44:57,816 --> 00:45:01,415
But you have to know to understand anything.

627
00:45:02,567 --> 00:45:04,911
And we have to introduce new words also to explain.

628
00:45:05,054 --> 00:45:10,795
But for you people
it is important to know two languages.

629
00:45:11,218 --> 00:45:16,106
Either know Marathi and English or Hindi or English.

630
00:45:17,792 --> 00:45:22,288
But if it is easy and if you want to know,

631
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:26,408
you should know these three languages
if possible, little bit of it.

632
00:45:28,424 --> 00:45:33,998
Marathi is the most difficult,
but Hindi is not so difficult.

633
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:37,708
Because we have to communicate.
We have to have a rapport.

634
00:45:38,061 --> 00:45:43,090
Or there is another language,
we can just sign — deaf and dumb language.

635
00:45:48,302 --> 00:45:49,765
You can try that.

636
00:45:49,919 --> 00:45:51,652
But it’s also complicated.

637
00:45:51,785 --> 00:45:54,652
You see, we had one deaf and dumb gentleman

638
00:45:55,609 --> 00:45:58,302
and for marriage he used to say like that, you see.

639
00:45:58,762 --> 00:46:01,010
So how will you know that marriage is this [sign].

640
00:46:01,122 --> 00:46:04,194
Because in marriage they put akshatas on people.

641
00:46:04,636 --> 00:46:08,376
So what he was [doing] was describing everything
according to his customs.

642
00:46:08,650 --> 00:46:12,394
And in England people would not understand
what does that mean (laughter).

643
00:46:15,274 --> 00:46:19,165
They might think, ‘throwing stones’.

644
00:46:22,422 --> 00:46:26,191
Now those who have not used kumkum,
say for example, if you say this one.

645
00:46:26,632 --> 00:46:28,513
So that means the wife
according to (Indian sign language).

646
00:46:28,728 --> 00:46:30,661
Or mangala sutra he will say.

647
00:46:30,951 --> 00:46:33,598
And now those who never wear mangala sutra,
how will you know?

648
00:46:34,431 --> 00:46:41,717
So, you see, even deaf and dumb language is very much
affected by the locality or the place you live in.

649
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,497
All right, so let us decide
to know some other language also.

650
00:46:46,026 --> 00:46:48,211
What other question?
