1
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:51,323
… These English young artists

2
00:45:51,524 --> 00:45:57,144
have really rendered it is
so remarkable, beautiful.

3
00:45:57,345 --> 00:46:01,548
My heart is really full of joy.

4
00:46:01,748 --> 00:46:09,550
All these things, if we can really
somehow or other put into the heads

5
00:46:09,751 --> 00:46:16,853
of people who are lost, the ignorance
in which they are just getting drowned,

6
00:46:17,054 --> 00:46:24,011
you just forgive them, forgive them, because
they don’t know what they are doing now.

7
00:46:24,212 --> 00:46:30,779
But I’m sure what he has prophesized

8
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:34,018
will come true, hundred per cent.

9
00:46:34,219 --> 00:46:38,619
My God bless you, may God bless England.

10
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:42,150
Tremendous.

11
00:46:42,922 --> 00:46:47,083
We have had a very, very serious sort
of a play

12
00:46:47,284 --> 00:46:52,253
and it’s good, because you see, hundred
years back

13
00:46:52,454 --> 00:46:56,485
how could this great poet see the vision
of today, you see?

14
00:46:56,686 --> 00:47:01,097
Not only that, he has described the house
which will be built

15
00:47:01,298 --> 00:47:08,141
by the Golden Builders. The house was
on Brompton Square,

16
00:47:08,342 --> 00:47:12,748
and he said it’s on a brook. So somehow
we had to open it out

17
00:47:12,949 --> 00:47:15,791
and we went down, we found there was
a brook there.

18
00:47:15,992 --> 00:47:24,099
It was built on the two shores, you can
say, two - [Hindi]

19
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,318
- on the two sides of the brook.

20
00:47:26,519 --> 00:47:32,801
And the whole span was covered with trusses
so long as 80 feet, 90 feet.

21
00:47:33,002 --> 00:47:36,209
So you can imagine, there was a brook
running down below.

22
00:47:36,410 --> 00:47:40,738
All the description of the house,
everything, is absolutely correct.

23
00:47:40,939 --> 00:47:45,186
Then he has also described our first
ashram, Chelsham Road,

24
00:47:45,387 --> 00:47:48,922
where he said will be shattered
by a bomb –

25
00:47:49,123 --> 00:47:53,141
is a fact. There was. Everything that
he’s described,

26
00:47:53,342 --> 00:47:56,063
I mean, he’s such a detailed visionary
he was.

27
00:47:56,264 --> 00:48:01,941
Another is C.S. Lewis, is another great
visionary who has described

28
00:48:02,142 --> 00:48:08,124
our procession in India, into such details
that it’s impossible to believe.

29
00:48:08,325 --> 00:48:13,033
So not that they were only scholarly, but
they really were visionaries,

30
00:48:13,234 --> 00:48:18,486
and it’s not just imagination but is
the imagination

31
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:27,701
which enters through the Divine power.
And then it reaches to Reality, so clearly.

32
00:48:27,909 --> 00:48:31,389
I don’t know how much these people
have worked hard for us,

33
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:36,931
how much they have done for us. Even
as we have Namadeva, who has sung that:

34
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:44,981
“Oh Mother, give me my Yoga”, all of them
have talked about this, sung about it.

35
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:48,663
But somehow or other, in the Kali Yuga,
people have gone

36
00:48:48,864 --> 00:48:51,553
into darkness, into ignorance. 
So forgive them.

37
00:48:51,754 --> 00:48:54,980
And I’m sure many will come out of it,
I’m very sure,

38
00:48:55,181 --> 00:48:58,207
and their visions were absolutely
correct

39
00:48:58,408 --> 00:49:02,344
and all those visions will be completely
fulfilled.

40
00:49:02,545 --> 00:49:05,436
May God bless you.
