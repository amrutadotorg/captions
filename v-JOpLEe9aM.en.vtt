WEBVTT

00:00.040 --> 00:01.936
After such

00:01.961 --> 00:03.857
beautiful

00:03.882 --> 00:05.111
divine

00:05.136 --> 00:05.855
music,

00:06.695 --> 00:08.475
I don’t know what to say.

00:09.230 --> 00:10.230
The,

00:11.430 --> 00:14.550
even the heart of all the Deities

00:14.620 --> 00:17.740
must be jumping with joy

00:17.740 --> 00:19.470
as you all were jumping with joy.

00:20.590 --> 00:22.230
It’s such a unison,

00:23.140 --> 00:24.310
the oneness

00:25.420 --> 00:27.300
with all the musicians

00:28.000 --> 00:30.210
and the celestial musicians it was.

00:30.880 --> 00:33.830
It was really a tremendous

00:33.830 --> 00:34.830
experience of joy.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.030
I must thank

00:40.580 --> 00:42.140
the people who have come

00:42.600 --> 00:45.280
all the way from Benin,

00:46.300 --> 00:49.350
they did so well, I mean, I just don’t know

00:49.630 --> 00:53.110
how rhythmically they always

00:53.120 --> 00:55.840
have been dancing.

00:55.840 --> 00:57.380
And in something in them,

00:58.180 --> 01:00.560
in the African people I’ve seen,

01:00.890 --> 01:01.920
they have

01:03.020 --> 01:04.360
such a lot of rhythm,

01:05.140 --> 01:08.060
all the time they are rhythmic:

01:08.060 --> 01:10.935
they’ll walk rhythmically, they’ll talk rhythmically.

01:11.215 --> 01:12.335
It’s sort of- I think sometimes –

01:12.670 --> 01:13.670
"Ke"

01:13.955 --> 01:16.695
Shri Shiva is acting through them.

01:16.815 --> 01:20.075
All the time this rhythm is so beautifully done

01:20.075 --> 01:23.155
and the way they change it, make it patterns,

01:23.155 --> 01:25.675
and double it, triple it

01:25.675 --> 01:28.679
and suddenly new patterns come out.

01:30.675 --> 01:33.235
[Aside] Now what is the other country, this one I don’t know.

01:33.235 --> 01:34.675
Other country?

01:34.675 --> 01:37.335
Sahaja Yogini: Ivory Coast

01:40.035 --> 01:42.355
Then comes Ivory Cost.

01:42.875 --> 01:46.815
And the people of Ivory Coast are also very remarkable.

01:47.555 --> 01:50.275
I was surprised the way

01:50.275 --> 01:52.390
the ladies also were dancing

01:52.395 --> 01:55.435
absolutely full of, full of rhythm.

01:55.915 --> 01:58.855
I mean all of you should learn rhythm from them.

01:58.855 --> 02:05.815
That is something so important to understand

02:05.815 --> 02:07.955
and

02:08.455 --> 02:11.295
to enjoy music

02:11.495 --> 02:12.815
and to enjoy Sahaj.

02:12.855 --> 02:15.035
You see, it's like a-

02:15.035 --> 02:19.215
I see so many lights there

02:19.215 --> 02:24.055
as if I felt you all got the lights in your throat, in your eyes,

02:24.055 --> 02:26.775
also in your Sahasrara.

02:27.280 --> 02:29.970
It was a wonderful time.

02:29.975 --> 02:35.515
So we must thank them especially these two people who have come all the way to entertain us

02:35.515 --> 02:37.995
and to make us enjoy everything.

02:37.995 --> 02:40.020
So we have to be very thankful.

02:40.235 --> 02:45.435
And how, see, so much far away they are otherwise,

02:45.435 --> 02:49.205
but how they have become so much one with us.

02:49.355 --> 02:53.815
We must thank the French for this, that they went

02:54.695 --> 02:57.195
and governed those countries.

02:57.415 --> 03:00.055
By their governing them, they came close to us!

03:00.235 --> 03:04.795
If they had not governed them, there would have been no possibility of meeting them so soon.

03:05.755 --> 03:10.355
So it’s such a beautiful combination, oneness

03:10.355 --> 03:11.495
with all of us

03:11.655 --> 03:13.675
and I must thank you again and again.

03:16.255 --> 03:19.255
Then we have another little thing

03:19.255 --> 03:22.275
which is very important at least to do.

03:22.275 --> 03:24.935
I’ve seen now such a genius,

03:24.935 --> 03:27.595
there is one genius born

03:27.775 --> 03:32.875
and he must be a great musician in his last life

03:32.875 --> 03:33.915
I’m sure!

03:33.915 --> 03:39.455
The way he handles the violin,

03:39.455 --> 03:40.835
I can’t believe it.

03:40.955 --> 03:46.190
But [unsure] he can play without notations or without something, is a miracle.

03:46.215 --> 03:50.535
And if that has happened because of Sahaja Yoga, I must say Sahaja Yoga itself

03:50.535 --> 03:51.655
is a miracle

03:51.835 --> 03:56.055
And then he took to Indian classical music,

03:56.055 --> 03:57.155
he was playing

03:57.935 --> 04:00.955
very deftly, absolutely so well,

04:01.035 --> 04:05.115
I was amazed how a talented person like him

04:05.115 --> 04:07.372
can take to any kind of music.

04:07.575 --> 04:12.550
And Babamama has already told Me that: “Your Sahaja Yogis are really talented.

04:12.575 --> 04:18.035
They are very talented people. Otherwise, how could they take to this difficult,

04:18.035 --> 04:20.295
classical, Indian music?

04:20.295 --> 04:23.080
Not only they have taken it but they have mastered it.”

04:23.115 --> 04:25.935
Now, we had on tabla another French man

04:25.955 --> 04:30.875
whom I had not seen for the last - I think-  three, four years,

04:31.375 --> 04:33.695
but I think now he has mastered it.

04:33.695 --> 04:36.675
The way he plays is really very remarkable.

04:36.675 --> 04:39.390
I was surprised how he could play.

04:39.395 --> 04:43.655
And then is this gentleman who played ” [raag] Malkans” to you.

04:43.655 --> 04:45.515
It’s a very difficult raga.

04:45.535 --> 04:50.055
In that one swara, we call them “madewa”,

04:50.555 --> 04:55.595
that is being taken away from the main team [range]

04:55.595 --> 05:00.255
and also the - I don’t know English word –

05:00.255 --> 05:02.375
the “pa” [sol] is also removed.

05:02.875 --> 05:08.319
It’s a very difficult, very melodious and not easily

05:08.735 --> 05:11.535
learnt his Malkans raag.

05:11.795 --> 05:15.535
I’m surprised how these people in such a short time

05:15.535 --> 05:17.655
have mastered such a difficult raga

05:17.749 --> 05:21.775
for which in India, Indians, have to work years together!

05:22.335 --> 05:25.370
But you, being even not Indian,

05:25.375 --> 05:27.955
you have never heard these notes

05:28.075 --> 05:31.535
and how you have achieved this mastery is beyond Me.

05:31.655 --> 05:36.895
It’s a real, I must say, the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga is

05:36.895 --> 05:38.475
that it has given you rhythm,

05:38.655 --> 05:41.735
it has given you “swarasasana”, means the notes.

05:41.735 --> 05:44.975
You are not weaving out from the notes.

05:44.975 --> 05:47.735
I’m not myself,  I myself

05:47.735 --> 05:48.235
don’t sing myself,

05:48.235 --> 05:50.095
I used to once upon a time

05:50.295 --> 05:55.555
but my family is so much in music that it has gone into my heart, into my mind.

05:56.055 --> 05:58.175
And when I see this, I say: “Look at that!

05:58.535 --> 06:00.695
How these people have come out!”

06:01.315 --> 06:05.075
The last but not the least is this lady, Ana.

06:05.315 --> 06:06.275
Sahaja Yogini: Anne.

06:06.275 --> 06:08.275
Who is another master.

06:08.395 --> 06:11.055
Well, they're all masters can you imagine?

06:11.055 --> 06:13.675
This little boy is already a master.

06:13.675 --> 06:16.735
But the ways he's accompanying Indian music, I mean,

06:16.735 --> 06:17.655
I’m amazed at him.

06:18.155 --> 06:22.794
In the same way, this lady the way she was rendering very difficult ragas,

06:23.064 --> 06:27.103
with such deftness with such perfection.

06:27.875 --> 06:32.200
I mean, I'm going to now take this film to India.

06:32.355 --> 06:38.205
They have been asking Me: “Mother why don’t you give your episodes, your programs to us.

06:38.255 --> 06:41.975
We’d like to broadcast it from the Television.”

06:41.975 --> 06:44.675
Now I’ll say: “Look at this, you see this,

06:44.675 --> 06:47.115
And they will all jump at it I tell you.

06:47.275 --> 06:50.075
They will have it and they will do it

06:50.075 --> 06:55.215
and they’ll be so amazed that how could, with Sahaja Yoga, you could master these things.

06:55.995 --> 06:57.995
And see the oneness of us.

06:58.715 --> 07:01.615
You are from this country you are from that country,

07:01.955 --> 07:05.555
and also speak different languages

07:06.055 --> 07:10.625
and you understand different words,

07:10.650 --> 07:11.783
everything differently.

07:11.808 --> 07:14.015
But when it comes to Sahaja bhajans,

07:14.055 --> 07:17.655
I don’t know how you get completely one with it.

07:18.570 --> 07:22.495
That shows that Sahaja Yoga is going to bring the whole world together

07:22.495 --> 07:25.430
through its music and through

07:25.455 --> 07:27.255
its manifestation.

07:28.955 --> 07:32.475
I am really very much honoured, I am thankful to all the artists,

07:32.475 --> 07:33.415
all of you

07:33.635 --> 07:35.895
for such beautiful rendering.

07:36.115 --> 07:40.615
For all the ladies who have come here, I wish I was young to learn their dancing.

07:40.615 --> 07:42.478
But I’m not.

07:51.695 --> 07:53.735
Also,  I used to sing very well

07:53.875 --> 07:59.834
But because of lecturing and all that I think I’ve lost that capacity to sing.

08:00.675 --> 08:05.775
Now you see, after you see this, it’s like a reflection of your heart,

08:05.861 --> 08:10.175
it’s the reflection of your ideas about your ideal, your visions.

08:10.395 --> 08:15.195
You see this world singing together the song of Divinity.

08:15.843 --> 08:21.155
It’s something nobody would believe, that we have such a good group of people here.

08:21.975 --> 08:24.935
I’m thankful to you all and to the audience

08:24.975 --> 08:29.849
who have joined and have shown their beautiful

08:29.895 --> 08:33.855
oneness and also the expression of their joy.

08:33.855 --> 08:36.175
May God bless you all.
