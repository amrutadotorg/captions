NOTE Language: en

00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.936
After such

00:00:01.961 --> 00:00:03.857
beautiful

00:00:03.882 --> 00:00:05.111
divine

00:00:05.136 --> 00:00:05.855
music,

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:08.475
I don’t know what to say.

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:10.230
The,

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.550
even the heart of all the Deities

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.740
must be jumping with joy

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.470
as you all were jumping with joy.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.230
It’s such a unison,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.310
the oneness

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.300
with all the musicians

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.210
and the celestial musicians it was.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.830
It was really a tremendous

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:34.830
experience of joy.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.030
I must thank

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.140
the people who have come

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.280
all the way from Benin,

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.350
they did so well, I mean, I just don’t know

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.110
how rhythmically they always

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.840
have been dancing.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.380
And in something in them,

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.560
in the African people I’ve seen,

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.920
they have

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.360
such a lot of rhythm,

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.060
all the time they are rhythmic:

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.935
they’ll walk rhythmically, they’ll talk rhythmically.

00:01:11.215 --> 00:01:12.335
It’s sort of- I think sometimes –

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:13.670
"Ke"

00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:16.695
Shri Shiva is acting through them.

00:01:16.815 --> 00:01:20.075
All the time this rhythm is so beautifully done

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.155
and the way they change it, make it patterns,

00:01:23.155 --> 00:01:25.675
and double it, triple it

00:01:25.675 --> 00:01:28.679
and suddenly new patterns come out.

00:01:30.675 --> 00:01:33.235
[Aside] Now what is the other country, this one I don’t know.

00:01:33.235 --> 00:01:34.675
Other country?

00:01:34.675 --> 00:01:37.335
Sahaja Yogini: Ivory Coast

00:01:40.035 --> 00:01:42.355
Then comes Ivory Cost.

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:46.815
And the people of Ivory Coast are also very remarkable.

00:01:47.555 --> 00:01:50.275
I was surprised the way

00:01:50.275 --> 00:01:52.390
the ladies also were dancing

00:01:52.395 --> 00:01:55.435
absolutely full of, full of rhythm.

00:01:55.915 --> 00:01:58.855
I mean all of you should learn rhythm from them.

00:01:58.855 --> 00:02:05.815
That is something so important to understand

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:07.955
and

00:02:08.455 --> 00:02:11.295
to enjoy music

00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:12.815
and to enjoy Sahaj.

00:02:12.855 --> 00:02:15.035
You see, it's like a-

00:02:15.035 --> 00:02:19.215
I see so many lights there

00:02:19.215 --> 00:02:24.055
as if I felt you all got the lights in your throat, in your eyes,

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:26.775
also in your Sahasrara.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:29.970
It was a wonderful time.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:35.515
So we must thank them especially these two people who have come all the way to entertain us

00:02:35.515 --> 00:02:37.995
and to make us enjoy everything.

00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:40.020
So we have to be very thankful.

00:02:40.235 --> 00:02:45.435
And how, see, so much far away they are otherwise,

00:02:45.435 --> 00:02:49.205
but how they have become so much one with us.

00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:53.815
We must thank the French for this, that they went

00:02:54.695 --> 00:02:57.195
and governed those countries.

00:02:57.415 --> 00:03:00.055
By their governing them, they came close to us!

00:03:00.235 --> 00:03:04.795
If they had not governed them, there would have been no possibility of meeting them so soon.

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:10.355
So it’s such a beautiful combination, oneness

00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:11.495
with all of us

00:03:11.655 --> 00:03:13.675
and I must thank you again and again.

00:03:16.255 --> 00:03:19.255
Then we have another little thing

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:22.275
which is very important at least to do.

00:03:22.275 --> 00:03:24.935
I’ve seen now such a genius,

00:03:24.935 --> 00:03:27.595
there is one genius born

00:03:27.775 --> 00:03:32.875
and he must be a great musician in his last life

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:33.915
I’m sure!

00:03:33.915 --> 00:03:39.455
The way he handles the violin,

00:03:39.455 --> 00:03:40.835
I can’t believe it.

00:03:40.955 --> 00:03:46.190
But [unsure] he can play without notations or without something, is a miracle.

00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:50.535
And if that has happened because of Sahaja Yoga, I must say Sahaja Yoga itself

00:03:50.535 --> 00:03:51.655
is a miracle

00:03:51.835 --> 00:03:56.055
And then he took to Indian classical music,

00:03:56.055 --> 00:03:57.155
he was playing

00:03:57.935 --> 00:04:00.955
very deftly, absolutely so well,

00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:05.115
I was amazed how a talented person like him

00:04:05.115 --> 00:04:07.372
can take to any kind of music.

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:12.550
And Babamama has already told Me that: “Your Sahaja Yogis are really talented.

00:04:12.575 --> 00:04:18.035
They are very talented people. Otherwise, how could they take to this difficult,

00:04:18.035 --> 00:04:20.295
classical, Indian music?

00:04:20.295 --> 00:04:23.080
Not only they have taken it but they have mastered it.”

00:04:23.115 --> 00:04:25.935
Now, we had on tabla another French man

00:04:25.955 --> 00:04:30.875
whom I had not seen for the last - I think-  three, four years,

00:04:31.375 --> 00:04:33.695
but I think now he has mastered it.

00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:36.675
The way he plays is really very remarkable.

00:04:36.675 --> 00:04:39.390
I was surprised how he could play.

00:04:39.395 --> 00:04:43.655
And then is this gentleman who played ” [raag] Malkans” to you.

00:04:43.655 --> 00:04:45.515
It’s a very difficult raga.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:50.055
In that one swara, we call them “madewa”,

00:04:50.555 --> 00:04:55.595
that is being taken away from the main team [range]

00:04:55.595 --> 00:05:00.255
and also the - I don’t know English word –

00:05:00.255 --> 00:05:02.375
the “pa” [sol] is also removed.

00:05:02.875 --> 00:05:08.319
It’s a very difficult, very melodious and not easily

00:05:08.735 --> 00:05:11.535
learnt his Malkans raag.

00:05:11.795 --> 00:05:15.535
I’m surprised how these people in such a short time

00:05:15.535 --> 00:05:17.655
have mastered such a difficult raga

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:21.775
for which in India, Indians, have to work years together!

00:05:22.335 --> 00:05:25.370
But you, being even not Indian,

00:05:25.375 --> 00:05:27.955
you have never heard these notes

00:05:28.075 --> 00:05:31.535
and how you have achieved this mastery is beyond Me.

00:05:31.655 --> 00:05:36.895
It’s a real, I must say, the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga is

00:05:36.895 --> 00:05:38.475
that it has given you rhythm,

00:05:38.655 --> 00:05:41.735
it has given you “swarasasana”, means the notes.

00:05:41.735 --> 00:05:44.975
You are not weaving out from the notes.

00:05:44.975 --> 00:05:47.735
I’m not myself,  I myself

00:05:47.735 --> 00:05:48.235
don’t sing myself,

00:05:48.235 --> 00:05:50.095
I used to once upon a time

00:05:50.295 --> 00:05:55.555
but my family is so much in music that it has gone into my heart, into my mind.

00:05:56.055 --> 00:05:58.175
And when I see this, I say: “Look at that!

00:05:58.535 --> 00:06:00.695
How these people have come out!”

00:06:01.315 --> 00:06:05.075
The last but not the least is this lady, Ana.

00:06:05.315 --> 00:06:06.275
Sahaja Yogini: Anne.

00:06:06.275 --> 00:06:08.275
Who is another master.

00:06:08.395 --> 00:06:11.055
Well, they're all masters can you imagine?

00:06:11.055 --> 00:06:13.675
This little boy is already a master.

00:06:13.675 --> 00:06:16.735
But the ways he's accompanying Indian music, I mean,

00:06:16.735 --> 00:06:17.655
I’m amazed at him.

00:06:18.155 --> 00:06:22.794
In the same way, this lady the way she was rendering very difficult ragas,

00:06:23.064 --> 00:06:27.103
with such deftness with such perfection.

00:06:27.875 --> 00:06:32.200
I mean, I'm going to now take this film to India.

00:06:32.355 --> 00:06:38.205
They have been asking Me: “Mother why don’t you give your episodes, your programs to us.

00:06:38.255 --> 00:06:41.975
We’d like to broadcast it from the Television.”

00:06:41.975 --> 00:06:44.675
Now I’ll say: “Look at this, you see this,

00:06:44.675 --> 00:06:47.115
And they will all jump at it I tell you.

00:06:47.275 --> 00:06:50.075
They will have it and they will do it

00:06:50.075 --> 00:06:55.215
and they’ll be so amazed that how could, with Sahaja Yoga, you could master these things.

00:06:55.995 --> 00:06:57.995
And see the oneness of us.

00:06:58.715 --> 00:07:01.615
You are from this country you are from that country,

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:05.555
and also speak different languages

00:07:06.055 --> 00:07:10.625
and you understand different words,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.783
everything differently.

00:07:11.808 --> 00:07:14.015
But when it comes to Sahaja bhajans,

00:07:14.055 --> 00:07:17.655
I don’t know how you get completely one with it.

00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:22.495
That shows that Sahaja Yoga is going to bring the whole world together

00:07:22.495 --> 00:07:25.430
through its music and through

00:07:25.455 --> 00:07:27.255
its manifestation.

00:07:28.955 --> 00:07:32.475
I am really very much honoured, I am thankful to all the artists,

00:07:32.475 --> 00:07:33.415
all of you

00:07:33.635 --> 00:07:35.895
for such beautiful rendering.

00:07:36.115 --> 00:07:40.615
For all the ladies who have come here, I wish I was young to learn their dancing.

00:07:40.615 --> 00:07:42.478
But I’m not.

00:07:51.695 --> 00:07:53.735
Also,  I used to sing very well

00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:59.834
But because of lecturing and all that I think I’ve lost that capacity to sing.

00:08:00.675 --> 00:08:05.775
Now you see, after you see this, it’s like a reflection of your heart,

00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:10.175
it’s the reflection of your ideas about your ideal, your visions.

00:08:10.395 --> 00:08:15.195
You see this world singing together the song of Divinity.

00:08:15.843 --> 00:08:21.155
It’s something nobody would believe, that we have such a good group of people here.

00:08:21.975 --> 00:08:24.935
I’m thankful to you all and to the audience

00:08:24.975 --> 00:08:29.849
who have joined and have shown their beautiful

00:08:29.895 --> 00:08:33.855
oneness and also the expression of their joy.

00:08:33.855 --> 00:08:36.175
May God bless you all.
