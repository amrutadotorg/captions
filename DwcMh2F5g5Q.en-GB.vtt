WEBVTT

00:01.620 --> 00:09.100
That, the central one [channel] is the sustaining
power, means is the power by which we evolve

00:09.100 --> 00:17.185
that means we get our sustenance as it is.
This sustenance that we have got as a human

00:17.185 --> 00:22.820
being, when it is to be manifested on the
five elements that we have within ourselves,

00:22.820 --> 00:33.679
the source is there, but we have to reach
it through its different elements. When this

00:33.679 --> 00:43.940
interchange takes place or we can say when
we have to put this force outside, that is

00:43.940 --> 00:49.730
to be done through establishment of dharma
on these.

00:49.730 --> 00:55.969
Like a superimposition or you can say the
connection. Like you can say, say there is

00:55.969 --> 01:03.485
sun. Sun is
the source of light and the source of light

01:03.485 --> 01:14.340
has come to this earth which is created out
of the five elements. So the sun's rays have

01:14.340 --> 01:24.460
to come. But when they come inside, in this
move, what do they do ? They enlighten this

01:24.460 --> 01:31.500
world. But it's only possible if there is
Dharma, means the light is there, the rays

01:31.500 --> 01:42.670
are there. The rays can be obstructed by many
things. If the rays are obstructed, then there

01:42.670 --> 01:53.300
is a-dharma. So the source of dharma, the
spreading of dharma and ultimately the manifestation

01:53.300 --> 02:14.349
onto the five elements is a complete thing
that is Void. This play goes on within us.

02:14.349 --> 02:26.099
Our evolutionary power which has worked from
the very beginning, from matter, when the

02:26.099 --> 02:44.760
matter got itself organized then we had carbon
as tetravalent, then from carbon the life

02:44.760 --> 03:08.349
started, all this is

03:08.349 --> 03:28.409
the work of the sustaining force. Then we
became human beings.

03:28.409 --> 03:55.220
Now we have got ten dharmas within us which
we have to keep alright. These are the main

03:55.220 --> 04:17.200
ten commandments. These ten commandments we
have to look after. And these are looked after

04:17.200 --> 04:33.840
by the people who are the primordial masters,
as you call them 'incarnations' like Raja

04:33.840 --> 04:59.760
Janaka, like Moses, like Socrates, like Nanaka,
the last one was the Shirdi Sai Nath. This

04:59.760 --> 05:21.479
is the principle is there, is the primordial
master. Now, there is another principle that

05:21.479 --> 05:39.850
is in there by which you receive it, this
is called as the disciple principle, the primordial

05:39.850 --> 05:55.569
disciple principle, represented by the moon
and the sun, presided by Buddha and Mahavira.

05:55.569 --> 06:19.690
So, this disciple element if it
is not in you, you cannot receive it. But

06:19.690 --> 06:44.520
when you start getting, receiving it, this
dharma gets into you and then you become the

06:44.520 --> 07:18.120
guru. You become the guru when this is completely
sustained. It starts as a disciple and then

07:18.120 --> 07:43.810
ends up as a Guru. This is the Void part within
us.

07:43.810 --> 08:14.939
First of all, as the human beings are, we
do not observe the first ten basic principles.

08:14.939 --> 08:45.110
In this country for example, or in the West,
we have, we observe the five of them because

08:45.110 --> 09:15.110
of law. In the countries like India they observe
the rest five, because of their society. So

09:15.110 --> 09:43.920
in anyway we are lacking some of them. Five
are missing here or five are missing there.

09:43.920 --> 10:23.550
This is
the situation of the dharma today. The gurus

10:23.550 --> 10:34.500
and the disciples they do this connection
and then the matter, which is created out

10:34.500 --> 11:16.230
of five elements, get vibrated. You can enlighten
the matter. When the dharma is complete you

11:16.230 --> 11:38.360
can enlighten the matter. The rituals that
these people used which was called as siddhu

11:38.360 --> 12:28.639
dharmic rituals they call it dudharmic, these
are the deeds of dharma, is to worship, to

12:28.639 --> 13:00.420
do Puja and to pray to God and to do all these
things, prayer. All these things after some

13:00.420 --> 13:22.410
time became absolutely dead in it, because
there was no Realized soul as a Guru and no

13:22.410 --> 14:01.010
Realized soul as a disciple. So it was just
a joke going on, you see. It has no meaning.

14:01.010 --> 14:27.310
Supposing I tell somebody who is not Realized
to give himself a bandhan, he cannot.

14:27.310 --> 14:40.980
[Apart...]
So this Void is so important because that

14:40.980 --> 14:51.319
is

14:51.319 --> 15:08.959
how you establish your receiving eggs in your
being, the five elements within you, meaning

15:08.959 --> 15:33.529
the five elements that exist. In Sahaja Yoga
we try the other way round stuff [Apart...]

15:33.529 --> 16:05.029
Now, what to do? This dharma is all ruined.
It is. There is another way: all these elements

16:05.029 --> 16:21.569
are represented in your chakras, different
chakras. So why not take the Kundalini through

16:21.569 --> 16:27.610
these chakras and enlighten the elements themselves
? Even there is no Dharma in a person you

16:27.610 --> 16:41.290
can do it. But then the Kundalini goes back
to all the places which you have missed. But

16:41.290 --> 16:59.690
if you have been to some guru and you have
bent your head before him, then the Kundalini

16:59.690 --> 17:04.500
stops at a point. It doesn't move it goes
here, there. It just stops, it doesn't move,

17:04.500 --> 17:14.000
very difficult. You have seen the Void pulsating
so badly. It just doesn't rise it always goes

17:14.000 --> 17:31.110
back into that bottomless pit as you can call
it. It's always sucked into that again and

17:31.110 --> 17:41.559
again if you have not a good... so we try
to remove the guru from your mind by so many

17:41.559 --> 17:49.840
ways. Deny them completely, absolutely so
that they get out of your minds.

17:49.840 --> 18:02.920
And again raise the Kundalini and from the
innermost, the Brahma Nadi as they call it,

18:02.920 --> 18:13.530
the innermost Nadi, the Sushumna Nadi, otherwise
you cannot reach there, from outside you go

18:13.530 --> 18:27.950
on cleansing, cleansing, cleansing until you
reach there, you find you cannot pierce it.

18:27.950 --> 18:37.409
But outside cleaning helps you in one way
that the Brahma Nadi becomes wider, the Nadi

18:37.409 --> 18:42.299
that is in the center of Sushumna. If you-
there's less pressure then it is a wider one

18:42.299 --> 18:47.380
so for Kundalini rising there is a better
chance.

18:47.380 --> 19:03.429
But in Sahaja Yoga, subtlest of subtlest Kundalini
we catch, and thread it microscopically inside

19:03.429 --> 19:16.659
and take it out. And by taking it out what
happens ? These chakras definitely get enlightened,

19:16.659 --> 19:28.570
they expand. That's how we expand the Sushumna.
Expending Brahmanadi. This was- this is the

19:28.570 --> 19:42.559
trick of Sahaja Yoga. Because this cleansing
is going to take too much time as you say.

19:42.559 --> 20:01.260
The whole thing is to be cleansed out and
then it is to be released and then you have

20:01.260 --> 20:12.870
to meet some guru who has to take it. So this
Sadhachar [virtue, correct action], whatever

20:12.870 --> 20:23.590
Buddha has said, the right, the right action,
the right that he has said is the one that

20:23.590 --> 20:38.130
is done. That's what it described. But that
doesn't work out with human beings, it's meant

20:38.130 --> 20:55.990
for people who are realized souls. Most of
these religions are meant for realized souls,

20:55.990 --> 21:06.380
you can find out. Actually realized souls
only took to religion before. Those who where

21:06.380 --> 21:16.240
born again, Dwijah, Brahmins, who took to
religion. But the time has come for people

21:16.240 --> 21:25.870
who are not realized also to take to religion
and to receive his blessings. Sahaja Yoga

21:25.870 --> 21:39.570
is the only way one can do it, is to take
it in the suttle most-inner most Nadi, enlighten

21:39.570 --> 21:49.409
every chakra, increase the size of the chakra,
pierce a little bit here, then again raise

21:49.409 --> 21:59.440
another thread, then again the third thread,
like that, go on expanding.

21:59.440 --> 22:03.460
Apart: This is it, you're alright ..
Better.

22:03.460 --> 22:20.890
This is how it works out. In our case, I did
the same, I mean just talking to you.

22:20.890 --> 22:45.029
Now the main thing about Void one has to remember
: there is no rationality. It's the hunger

22:45.029 --> 23:00.480
inside the stomach and hunger has no rationality
: if it is hungry it will eat. It has to eat,

23:00.480 --> 23:15.600
no rationality can satisfy it : if you are
hungry, you're hungry. And when you have spiritual

23:15.600 --> 23:25.830
hunger, the same hunger becomes subtler and
subtler ultimately it becomes the spiritual.

23:25.830 --> 23:45.440
First the hunger starts of, say, food, of
primitive things. Then hunger for sex life,

23:45.440 --> 24:06.700
hunger for women, hunger for men, then for
power, then for money. Then the hunger for

24:06.700 --> 24:09.230
spirituality starts.

24:09.230 --> 24:26.940
When that hunger is concentrated and starts
rising without any rationality about it : you

24:26.940 --> 24:54.510
don't know why you are seeking. Like Buddha
he had everything, he had a wife and his father

24:54.510 --> 25:19.990
had provided him with everything. Still his
heart was seeking. Why was he seeking ? It's

25:19.990 --> 25:38.260
the hunger that is not rationality, that isn't
explained.

25:38.260 --> 26:04.250
And then this hunger starts and the way we
quench that hunger is Dharma. The way we keep

26:04.250 --> 26:40.760
it intact is the Dharma. Supposing you are
hungry: you go and eat some poison. Then it

26:40.760 --> 26:59.440
is a-dharma. I know you are hungry but you
have to eat proper food. The knowledge about

26:59.440 --> 27:14.570
that is Dharma : what food you must eat, what
book you must read, what people you must meet,

27:14.570 --> 27:28.370
how you should live, what should be your attitude
towards others, others' things, other's wife,

27:28.370 --> 27:43.299
children, daughters. Everything related to
the other, all that knowledge is Dharma. But

27:43.299 --> 27:57.070
it has no rationality. Like, you see, a man
ran away- say- with somebody's daughter, he

27:57.070 --> 28:10.220
would say: « What's wrong ? » I cannot answer.
I cannot answer. If a man has bad relations,

28:10.220 --> 28:25.630
say, with his own mother. He says : « What's
wrong in this ? » You cannot answer, there's

28:25.630 --> 28:50.850
no rationality. It is wrong, it's a fact : « Though
shall not commit adultery. » Christ has said

28:50.850 --> 29:09.340
even to have adulteress eyes is wrong. But
at the time, it was Christ who came. At the

29:09.340 --> 29:25.250
Moses time people did not know this eyes business,
but Christ would see that and He had said

29:25.250 --> 29:38.970
that « Those who have even adulteress eyes
are comiting the sin. »

29:38.970 --> 29:59.909
So, how to deal with others ? Say, materialism
now : you are so attached to matter is also

29:59.909 --> 30:15.659
problem with the Nabhi. Materialism is a false
identification with matter: all false [inaudible

30:15.659 --> 30:45.380
word] with matter, with human beings, with
books, with all that is created is the problem

30:45.380 --> 31:04.710
of Nabhi so you can understand how important
it's now. And the one that prescribes it is

31:04.710 --> 31:20.980
the Dharma, is the Guru. They did not come
like Gurus to convince you and argue out with

31:20.980 --> 31:32.350
you, they said : « Thou shall not... » That's
the commandment. Commandment means there's

31:32.350 --> 31:46.250
not to reason why. It's a commandment. There's
no rationality in Dharma. Now, the one who

31:46.250 --> 32:09.019
is dharmic does not think about sin at all.
Now, I'll tell you about myself, say, I go

32:09.019 --> 32:40.570
to a party and they start a cabaret dance.
I do not think about it wether it is illegal

32:40.570 --> 32:59.400
or wether it is wrong with this adharma, nothing.
I do not think but immediately I vomit. My

32:59.400 --> 33:15.860
grand-children, you see, we one day were watching
the TV and three of them came vomitting. I

33:15.860 --> 33:31.299
went and saw the TV and it was a horrid thing
going on. They just came and started vomitting.

33:31.299 --> 33:40.330
There's no rationality about it : it is again
human sustenance. It is sub-human.

33:40.330 --> 33:48.760
Like animals cannot feel the dirt or filth
we can. We feel horrible smell coming, but

33:48.760 --> 33:58.000
those who work, say, in filth cannot feel
any smell. If you go near a factory where

33:58.000 --> 34:20.540
sugar is produced you feel terrible there
get the smell of this molasses and you can't

34:20.540 --> 34:56.700
bear it, but those who are working there,
are so much used to it that they cannot feel

34:56.700 --> 35:13.960
it. Those who live in sin cannot feel the
sin after some times, they become insensitive.

35:13.960 --> 35:37.680
But sin is a sin. So the insensitivity when
we develop within ourselves we become adharmic.

35:37.680 --> 35:49.230
When we are sensitive about it we are dharmic.

35:49.230 --> 36:06.880
On the left hand side, the intuition about
it, the auspiciousness of it, is the thing

36:06.880 --> 36:16.560
that one has to learn: auspisciouness. Houswife
is to be respected, honoured and comforted

36:16.560 --> 36:25.550
because it is auspiscious. A wife has to be
respectable. A housewife doesn't- hum. It

36:25.550 --> 36:33.680
doesn't look nice for a housewife, you see,
to be dressed in a funny way.

36:33.680 --> 36:47.700
Once the chief cabinet secretary from India,
his wife had come and she used to think she's

36:47.700 --> 37:03.480
very young and smart or something. She was
wearing these tied jeans and things like that,

37:03.480 --> 37:18.620
you see, and the poor husband, you see, looked
this side, that side. He didn't know what

37:18.620 --> 37:29.880
to do, and she's, I mean -very big nonsense-
why ? And she came down in London, she was

37:29.880 --> 37:42.410
thinking how she's great, smart, thin. And
they were invited to a dinner, you see, it's

37:42.410 --> 37:52.320
real thing, you know, real thing that has
happened. And when this man was to go from

37:52.320 --> 38:05.800
somewhere and she had to go from somewhere
else. So, when he went there, he said : « Where

38:05.800 --> 38:18.520
is my wife ? » They said : « She hasn't
come yet. » He said : « No she was to come,

38:18.520 --> 38:27.060
she's not like that, she's much smarter than
me, she must have arrived. » He looked around,

38:27.060 --> 38:37.010
he couldn't find her. And there was a lady
standing, he said : « There your secretary

38:37.010 --> 38:46.710
has come, she's standing there. » And he
didn't know what to say because she really

38:46.710 --> 38:53.210
looked like a secretary and not his wife.

38:53.210 --> 39:15.350
So the housewife has to be dignified and respectable
and she is to be respected. It's the part

39:15.350 --> 39:37.820
of that auspisciousness. And the wife, that
essence of a wife is the governing so you

39:37.820 --> 39:49.480
can imagine those women who stand for lib
and all that those who try to sort of say

39:49.480 --> 39:59.250
that : « Why should we be respectable if
the husband is not, if he is carrying on with

39:59.250 --> 40:09.340
other women I should also carry on with other
men. » You must know that you are being holding

40:09.340 --> 40:18.640
that great position in the stomach, on the
left hand side of every human being. And that's

40:18.640 --> 40:30.130
why the left Nabhi catches in England so much
and America, I think it's missing it already.

40:30.130 --> 40:40.340
So, that is to ask to -- say - to a man, you
see, who is so developped, and so he thinks

40:40.340 --> 40:51.960
no ends of himself, you see, and the civilization
where work is so important and money is even

40:51.960 --> 41:13.070
more important than work is, XX ? to think
that a housewife's respectability is so important

41:13.070 --> 41:28.950
in the play of the universe? Yes it is. Where
the women become dis-repectable the whole,

41:28.950 --> 41:41.460
you see, that's the breaking point of the
society. There the human beings will start

41:41.460 --> 41:49.740
destroying. That's the real atomic bomb you've
got. But it is so, I cannot rationalize it,

41:49.740 --> 41:54.510
it is made like that.

41:54.510 --> 42:01.630
All the Gurus have said : « You should not
drink. » Even Moses. Every one of them have

42:01.630 --> 42:11.660
said it : « You cannot drink. », means take
any kind of a alcohol or any things that will

42:11.660 --> 42:25.040
take away your awareness because that is the
place of your awareness. In the sense that

42:25.040 --> 42:42.570
whatever goes wrong here spoils your attention
and if your attention is spoiled your awareness

42:42.570 --> 43:06.800
is spoiled. The attention is here. The attention
is in the stomach, in the Void. So, how important

43:06.800 --> 43:17.620
is your attention.
Wherever you put your attention, that works

43:17.620 --> 43:36.730
out. When you are Realized, then your attention
is Realized. Wherever you put your attention

43:36.730 --> 44:07.850
it works like a spade, it works like a sword,
it works like a loving hand, it works like

44:07.850 --> 44:49.650
kiss, it works like a comforting heart. It
is an enlightened attention in your stomach.

44:49.650 --> 45:34.130
You see the mother has a child in the stomach,
how it looks after the child, a little baby,

45:34.130 --> 45:49.740
how it protects. All that is there, is given
to us through our Gurus, our own beings which

45:49.740 --> 46:03.800
are our masters, true teachers. The stomach
teaches you, your stomach is your Guru. Amoeba

46:03.800 --> 46:25.740
became a human being through this stomach
only, through the hunger it had. If it did

46:25.740 --> 46:41.800
not have hunger it would not have evolved.
And the hunger teaches you, and when you learn

46:41.800 --> 47:04.210
it properly then you become the Guru yourself
of the whole world and the universe.

47:04.210 --> 47:12.940
Void, that' why, is very important and when
you have had bad gurus, you've read horrible

47:12.940 --> 47:22.180
books, accepted them as facts and thruths,
then your Void gets spoiled, your attention

47:22.180 --> 47:38.860
gets spoiled. It goes to wrong things. Attention,
when it works through your eyes, can also

47:38.860 --> 47:57.200
go to wrong things. Everywhere wherever attention
moves, it can do wrong things if it is adharmic.

47:57.200 --> 48:15.620
But as I said, there is no rationality about
it. Dharma is to be accepted. You cannot rationalize

48:15.620 --> 48:36.650
it. To a point one can, but how far it harms
you, you cannot rationalize. Then the curse

48:36.650 --> 48:46.340
of Divine comes on you.

48:46.340 --> 49:13.470
Any kind of fanaticism or identification with
one ideal- like Muslims thinking they are

49:13.470 --> 49:48.261
Muslims- they're adharmic. They're not dharmic.
dharma is that you have to respect all the

49:48.261 --> 50:27.420
religions. It is a sin not to respect any
incarnation. It is a sin not to respect any

50:27.420 --> 50:44.080
religion. And to identify with one, and denounce
of other.

50:44.080 --> 51:12.410
So, give up all these false dharmas and come
to that one dharma which evolves you, which

51:12.410 --> 51:45.360
gives you light by which you can see the oneness
among all these religions. As I've said before,

51:45.360 --> 52:03.370
that
they are like beautiful flowers on one tree,

52:03.370 --> 52:30.160
nurtured by one sap, adorned by one tree,
but fools take the flowers out, say that these

52:30.160 --> 52:57.930
are our flowers and kill them. And when these
flowers die, uglyness becomes the so-called

52:57.930 --> 52:59.060
religions.

52:59.060 --> 53:10.540
So, in essences, respect all the religions,
all the incarnations. Fanaticism is absolutely

53:10.540 --> 53:36.220
against Nabhi and against the Void, because
the whole balance of your Void has to be kept.

53:36.220 --> 53:56.440
In a very subtle and subtler form you'll be
sticking onto it.

53:56.440 --> 54:14.240
Say, you are born a Christian, so whatever
you may try you can never get out of this

54:14.240 --> 54:51.140
feeling that we are Christians. You'll have
much more respect for Mary in heart than for,

54:51.140 --> 55:41.380
say, Lakshmi. While, you are a Hindu, you
will have much more respect for Radha than

55:41.380 --> 56:04.790
for Mary. That will be lingering on and lingering
on.

56:04.790 --> 56:21.600
When you develop that balance alright then
you are dharmic.

56:21.600 --> 56:39.340
That balancing has to be done.
So one realization is within you like this

56:39.340 --> 57:07.700
and one realization is this way , among you.
and this is Dharma. Among all of you there

57:07.700 --> 57:26.600
has to be another integration, a complete
integration of understanding. Whether you

57:26.600 --> 57:42.010
are white, black or red. Whether a Hindu,
Christian or anything. You must know that

57:42.010 --> 58:03.420
there is only one way that is the living way
of evolution and that there is only one God.

58:03.420 --> 58:16.010
And all of them [Incarnations] are aspects
of the same God, and there is no quarelling

58:16.010 --> 58:23.670
among them.
Why are you quarelling ? This goes against

58:23.670 --> 58:38.410
the Void.
Complete integration works out in the stomach.

58:38.410 --> 58:55.820
And when you are completely integrated, you'll
be surprised, rationality drops out. Automatically

58:55.820 --> 59:08.220
it drops out. Rationality kills this integration,
because if your heart says something rationality

59:08.220 --> 59:24.220
says : « No, it's not right. ». But, if
you take out your rationality there and just

59:24.220 --> 59:45.610
see for yourself, then wisdom comes in and
you just do it whatever is wise and good for

59:45.610 --> 59:50.740
your spirituality.
Apart :

59:50.740 --> 59:55.470
How are you now ?
Better

59:55.470 --> 01:00:16.170
So, Void we use in Sahaja Yoga in many ways.
First of all, we have to first of all see

01:00:16.170 --> 01:00:35.130
the Void of a person, how he has got the Void.
You can see it, very easily because it might

01:00:35.130 --> 01:00:56.630
be pulsating. Maybe not be in your presence,
I don't know, but in My presence it does.

01:00:56.630 --> 01:01:15.860
But immediately you can feel the Void. The
Void you feel here, on the here or on here.

01:01:15.860 --> 01:01:37.380
Now, just see these are the bases of all the
chakras. You feel the Void here, or here.

01:01:37.380 --> 01:01:49.490
Bases of all the chakras you can feel, so
you can understand how important is the Void.

01:01:49.490 --> 01:02:00.630
Now, if it is catching here anywhere or catching
here, then you have to ask the person about

01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:10.510
these various points : whether he's a materialist,
whether he is a fanatic. But these questions

01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:35.340
you cannot ask out directly like say : "Are
you a fanatic ? You hit me hard. "

01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:45.790
[Laughters]
Not to be very, very clever about it. Now

01:02:45.790 --> 01:02:57.480
how to ask a person whether you are a fanatic
or not ? Very easy. Say, he's a Muslim. So,

01:02:57.480 --> 01:03:06.170
you just ask him to put your hand, saying
that : « Should I put some Kumkum on your

01:03:06.170 --> 01:03:18.180
head ? » His fanaticism will come out immediately
: « I can't do this ! » If he is a Christian,

01:03:18.180 --> 01:03:28.160
then you just ask him : « Can you put a Swastika
on your head ? » Cross he'll accept. Swastika

01:03:28.160 --> 01:03:57.590
: « No, I'm not Hitler ! » That's how you
can make it out whether he's open minded or

01:03:57.590 --> 01:04:14.640
not by suggesting things like this, you see.
So then he comes out with his fanaticism.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:28.800
Then what do you do ? You do not condemn him
as a fanatic, no. That won't be Sahaja style.

01:04:28.800 --> 01:04:39.270
You say : « Alright, alright, I've got it.
The cross, would that be alright ? Alright,

01:04:39.270 --> 01:04:50.960
take the cross. So, if I say that cross was
first Swastika then it became cross, will

01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.270
you be angry ? » Gradually it will work out.

01:04:55.270 --> 01:05:00.970
33:03
But if he's a fanatic, you go outside and

01:05:00.970 --> 01:05:13.500
tell Muhammad to be him nicely. He will do
the job. Shoebeating is very necessary for

01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:18.540
all fanatics. Nice shoebeat. But fanatics
are one of the most difficult persons.

01:05:18.540 --> 01:05:19.540
33:25

01:05:19.540 --> 01:05:25.920
Then those who have been to other gurus also
will be showing up. These days you don't get

01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:33.040
fanatics so many to come to Sahaja Yoga. Mostly
they are guru beaten. You see there are [frocks?]

01:05:33.040 --> 01:05:42.340
beaten people, there are guru beaten also.
I mean, mostly they are guru beaten. [Laughters]

01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:50.810
Then you ask them : « Have you been to a
guru ? What your guru has done ? This, that.

01:05:50.810 --> 01:05:56.270
» If you tell them sometimes they can be
fanatically attached to their gurus. Then

01:05:56.270 --> 01:06:05.510
they migh be angry. They'll do it, but what
to do ? It is sometimes-

01:06:05.510 --> 01:06:30.460
It 's the food ?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes It is....

01:06:30.460 --> 01:06:32.180
It's good they are lookin after the food very
nicely

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:37.380
[Laughters]
Otherwise if you have to cook also then all

01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:45.950
your attention is there. So it's much better
that your ashram. [Laughters]

01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:48.940
No headache, nothing, your are having a nice
time here and their food is ready, now serve,

01:06:48.940 --> 01:06:52.300
come along, have your food. So, the right
time we are talking about Void. [Laughters]

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.750
I'll sit here .
Sahaja Yogi: .. the Nabhi satisfied

01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:59.010
Shri Mataji: Yes, make the food also dharmic
and every thing.

01:06:59.010 --> 01:07:03.020
Good. How are you now? Better?
Sahaja Yogini: Yes

01:07:03.020 --> 01:07:05.860
Shri Mataji: How are you now?
[interruption of recording during the meal]

01:07:05.860 --> 01:07:11.230
It's such a wide subject that I cannot cover
it in one lecture, you coud write many books,

01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:16.440
but the most important thing about Void is
that, that once you are enlightened you become

01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:17.440
dharmic yourself. The Dharma starts flowing
through your hands. These vibrations have

01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.600
a capacity to establish Dharma. So, when you
put your hands now towards the five elements.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:22.450
Say you put your hands towards the water or
you put your hand in the water. The water

01:07:22.450 --> 01:07:23.640
gets enlighted, vibrated, but if somebody
takes that water it will establish Dharma

01:07:23.640 --> 01:07:25.030
into that person. Supposing somebody is a
drunkard, now you put this vibrated water

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.410
to him, give him to drink. He feels nauseated
after drinks. He'll throw away the drinks,

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.840
then he will stop.

01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:39.370
Some of you have noticed that when you came
to Me first you felt terrible nausea within

01:07:39.370 --> 01:07:48.340
you and you felt like vomiting, sometimes
you felt uneasy, you see. So these vibrations

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.420
through the water now pass into your stomach
and they establish dharma there, the proper

01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:58.020
relationship. It so happens that if you go
on taking this water the right-side is that

01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:08.040
physically you feel alright and the water
can give you such a power, that you can never

01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:27.720
get cancer of the stomach, cannot get any
trouble with the stomach. But left-side side,

01:08:27.720 --> 01:08:49.350
which has greater power, this water, that
it cleanses you, your sins - and puts your

01:08:49.350 --> 01:08:55.330
attention, fixes it up on dharma.

01:08:55.330 --> 01:08:56.440
So, your attention doesn't do- you're not
tempted, that's how you've seen people who

01:08:56.440 --> 01:09:00.360
come to Sahaja Yoga can give up drinks easily.
Because it turns your attention towards dharma,

01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:06.740
then if you want to take drinks, you just
don't feel like after some times. You feel

01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:13.310
like vomiting, you feel like headache and
all that. And it happens so easily. Now we

01:09:13.310 --> 01:09:31.620
know somebody here he gave up all his drinking
in no time. Otherwise it's not possible to

01:09:31.620 --> 01:10:01.230
do that, but because of this happening in
the stomach, now you cannot drink.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:08.550
Just imagine. This is the great thing about
Void is that once you are enlightened you

01:10:08.550 --> 01:10:14.750
can give something to the nature. You have
been drawing everything from nature so far.

01:10:14.750 --> 01:10:28.630
First time now you start giving something
to the nature. And what you give to the nature

01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:36.362
is so nourrishing to it also. Supposing you
give vibrations to, say, fruits, or to trees,

01:10:36.362 --> 01:10:38.760
or to flowers. You will find they will be
ten times more, the growth will be much more,

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:43.560
they will be lustrous. And they will be very
juicy, very tasty and the whole atmosphere

01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:45.897
will be different. Maybe after sometimes these
trees if they will be standing there everybody

01:10:45.897 --> 01:10:51.770
passing that way if he touches that tree they
will get the vibrations also.

01:10:51.770 --> 01:10:52.770
So maybe a tree may become a curer, something
like that. All those waters and all that,

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:53.770
we talk of « curing water » are nothing
but vibrated waters. They are vibrated. So,

01:10:53.770 --> 01:11:01.870
if the vibrated water goes inside, you get
cured. So, this is on the left-hand side it

01:11:01.870 --> 01:11:04.130
works that it establishes your religion within
you.

01:11:04.130 --> 01:11:06.610
All the problems we have had is all completely
cleansed out by them. In the same way if you

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:08.278
enlighten a light now here. You have seen
so many times how you can enlighten a light.

01:11:08.278 --> 01:11:09.278
So it starts going, see, both are there but
this one is working a bit. That one also is

01:11:09.278 --> 01:11:10.278
going a little bit but this one makes a X?
taking out the blackness. It is because it

01:11:10.278 --> 01:11:11.278
is enlightened. That is also enlightened,
now we also ?. But this one actually in the

01:11:11.278 --> 01:11:12.278
hand is taking away the- If you see these
lights you can feel they're like pulled out

01:11:12.278 --> 01:11:13.278
like this. As if, you see, the realized lights
are pulled out like this, straight.

01:11:13.278 --> 01:11:14.278
And, I've been to some of these churches where
they have these lights and as soon as I enter

01:11:14.278 --> 01:11:15.278
these like they're all going like 'kakakakakak'.
It is interesting to see how they start suddenly

01:11:15.278 --> 01:11:16.278
glowing like that. But people do not notice
it because they do not understand why it has

01:11:16.278 --> 01:11:17.278
happened, but you can understand that. So,
if you put the light, enlightened light - Say,

01:11:17.278 --> 01:11:18.278
yesterday, the other day, we had that Havana,
is the enlightened light. Havana we had made

01:11:18.278 --> 01:11:19.278
it enlightened, Jagrut. Then whatever we put
into it, you see, our badhas, it burns whatever

01:11:19.278 --> 01:11:20.278
we wanted to burn away. What is the beauty
of fire is, that, say, if you have some mixed

01:11:20.278 --> 01:11:21.278
up gold and you put into fire, you find the
gold will be separated and the filth or dirt

01:11:21.278 --> 01:11:22.278
or whatever is inside, it will be separated.

01:11:22.278 --> 01:11:23.278
So, this quality which is the right hand side
quality of the fire is becomes in the left

01:11:23.278 --> 01:11:24.278
hand side is that when you go near such a
fire or you use such a fire or a light, then

01:11:24.278 --> 01:11:25.278
what happens that whatever is unwanted in
you is burned away and you get the pure thing.

01:11:25.278 --> 01:11:26.278
So it purifies. Fire is a purifyer and it
is a melter, it melts your heart. This fire

01:11:26.278 --> 01:11:27.990
melts your heart and you feel the compassion.
So that's how every element can be enlightened

01:11:27.990 --> 01:11:28.990
and this is the work done in that Void by
your Kundalini. Kundalini goes to various

01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.990
places and She enlightens all these elements
in your stomach.

01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.990
In the stomach the basic principle is of water.
The Void is covered with water, and in the

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.990
water there is salt and the salt is nothing
but is the Dharma. Is the Dharma, the salt.

01:11:31.990 --> 01:11:32.990
That's why when we give you salt what happens
the salt that is vibrated goes and helps you

01:11:32.990 --> 01:11:33.990
in the stomach. And salt shows it's own nature
there by absorbing all that is in you which

01:11:33.990 --> 01:11:34.990
is, we can say, in the mobile there. A person
- supposing is, hum, has got a cancer of throat,

01:11:34.990 --> 01:11:35.990
then he should take salt. If he has a right
hand side problem he should take sugar. So

01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:37.071
these are the two qualities, you see, the
five of dharmas are done by salt and five

01:11:37.071 --> 01:11:38.071
by sugar. And these are the best solvants
in the world as you know. So, all these three

01:11:38.071 --> 01:11:39.071
things put together water, then salt, and
the sugar, they solve the problem of the Void.

01:11:39.071 --> 01:11:40.071
That's why we use these two things. If you
remember Christ has said that you are the

01:11:40.071 --> 01:11:41.071
salt. That means you are the Gurus. Salt is
the Guru. That's why he said : « You are

01:11:41.071 --> 01:11:42.071
the salt. » Because you are the Gurus. And
salt disolves into water. Water is the Dharma.

01:11:42.071 --> 01:11:43.071
They are the absorber, always have a water
of crytalization. The- it cannot without,

01:11:43.071 --> 01:11:44.071
the salt cannot exist without water. So, the
water and salt put together means the ocean.

01:11:44.071 --> 01:11:45.071
So Void is the ocean within us. That's why
it is called as Sagar. That means all the

01:11:45.071 --> 01:11:47.260
oceans of the world are in our stomach

01:11:47.260 --> 01:11:48.870
43 :30
and if you want to hear them sometimes you

01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:51.510
can put your thumb in My ears and you can
hear coming [as one sound...?] You can hear

01:11:51.510 --> 01:11:52.510
it.

01:11:52.510 --> 01:11:53.510
So this is all the times socially churned
and out of it comes out all that is good and

01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:54.510
whatever is bad is burnt away or washed away
or made to -- whith the air -- it is made

01:11:54.510 --> 01:11:55.510
to be swept off. So the air element is also
there, air element that we see all around.

01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:56.510
[recording cut ]
So the vibrated air is a very important thing

01:11:56.510 --> 01:11:57.510
and it helps a lot.
[recording cut]

01:11:57.510 --> 01:11:58.510
So I've talked to you about all the [?] of
the fifth Akasha, the ether you can say. That

01:11:58.510 --> 01:11:59.510
works out when you are a realized soul. Then
you, you also vibrate the Ether. That's how

01:11:59.510 --> 01:12:00.510
our, mean, collective work is done, through
the Ether, you see. Now, supposing I want

01:12:00.510 --> 01:12:01.510
that you should get a proper seat [or ?] or
something

01:12:01.510 --> 01:12:02.510
Apart:
Alright, take a seat up there.

01:12:02.510 --> 01:12:03.510
Anything materialistic you can say, [oh, my
chair is going down there, how is it ?] I

01:12:03.510 --> 01:12:04.510
have to just worry about it, immediately it'll
go [order some set?] - [Shri Mataji snaps

01:12:04.510 --> 01:12:05.510
her fingers] - Alright ? So, Saint Michael
and Saint Catherine, both of them say now

01:12:05.510 --> 01:12:06.510
: « What should we do ? We must find out
a proper place. » So, they take down into

01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:07.510
consideration. They bring him down here and
find out a nice [place?] Is all done through

01:12:07.510 --> 01:12:08.510
Ether.

01:12:08.510 --> 01:12:09.510
Ether, is the..., when it is enlightened,
you see, then it communicates the ideas, the

01:12:09.510 --> 01:12:10.510
things that shall be done, or the desire,
divine desires are carried out. And then you

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:11.510
are placed in His hands sometimes you are
surprised : « How am I here ? How are you

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:12.510
here ? How do I meet you ? I mean, I was not
to come this side and then now how did I come

01:12:12.510 --> 01:12:13.510
? » All these things can be done through
the Ether which -even we get our television

01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:14.510
and everything through Ether. But on the television,
if the Ether, if you, say, enlighten then

01:12:14.510 --> 01:12:15.510
it will so happen, that a bad [?] program
won't materialize. It won't materialize.

01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:16.510
It can work very dynamically. You cannot imagine
how these miracles take place. And real miracles

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:17.510
are felt- of course we do feel the miracles
of all the other elements but it's not so

01:12:17.510 --> 01:12:18.510
obvious as that of the Ether because you're
suddenly surprised : « How this... ? Why

01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:19.510
? » And it's everybody's surprised at it
: « oh, here in the plane, you get all this.

01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:20.510
» So, this is done by Ether and it is so
miraculous. It is so miraculous that it is

01:12:20.510 --> 01:12:21.510
hard to believe that it is possible.

01:12:21.510 --> 01:12:22.510
Now, this Ehter works day time and night time.
It doesn't take rest anywhere, you see. It's

01:12:22.510 --> 01:12:23.510
all the time working for us, means it's all
the time ready to work out the divine work.

01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:24.510
All the time it is ready to work out the divine
work. It doesn't wait. It doesn't wait for

01:12:24.510 --> 01:12:25.510
anyone to give orders or anything, it's just,
just waiting there. As soon as it sees that

01:12:25.510 --> 01:12:26.510
this is desired, alright, nothing is to be
told, just to desire and you'll say that : « Oh,

01:12:26.510 --> 01:12:27.510
what will be happening to such and such person
? » Finished, it's done. It is being transmitted.

01:12:27.510 --> 01:12:28.510
The same Ether that transmits the - what you
call ? - the air transmissions which you receive

01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:29.510
on the radios, radio transmissions. The same
one, when enlightened, does all this job.

01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:30.510
He works it out everything. Everything that
you want it works it out. And there's how

01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:31.510
the angels show their [ Shri Mataji searches
the word in Marathi] miraculous feats. But

01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:32.510
it is worth noticing all that and watching
it, and witnessing it and noting it down : « Oh,

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:33.510
how it helped and how it worked out ! »
It also, ether when enlightened, brings people

01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:34.510
closer to divine power. It arranges how [?] But,
now, one would ask what is the necessity for

01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:35.510
God to have such complicated methods of 'enlightening
the matter'? Why not it has already the enlightened

01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:36.510
matter ? It's the question one should ask,
I mean, I'm asking as you people are there,

01:12:36.510 --> 01:12:36.518
so I'm asking you. Let's see the answer.
