[Music]

00:36.660 --> 00:41.479
[Music]

00:43.570 --> 00:48.359
and it happened I really saw

00:48.690 --> 00:56.090
there's a difference between vs. iron

00:51.670 --> 00:59.229
mine I saw this

00:56.090 --> 00:59.229
[Music]

01:00.309 --> 01:07.979
how do you uh transfer just like this

01:17.560 --> 01:30.000
I saw so many permutations of

01:22.740 --> 01:30.000
[Music]

01:30.240 --> 01:41.040
and as if every weapon was engaging

01:34.460 --> 01:46.200
absolutely so it didn't they eat open

01:41.040 --> 01:51.990
out it was so hot it was no problem such

01:46.200 --> 01:57.690
an army wasn't no fluctuation as if they

01:51.990 --> 02:01.979
were dancing tonight and we colors I'll

01:57.690 --> 02:10.640
spread out their lighter the center I

02:01.979 --> 02:10.640
thought wrong

02:13.220 --> 02:17.610
to mess with top

02:15.430 --> 02:22.820
[Music]

02:17.610 --> 02:27.600
so dark and alone laughs so now it's

02:22.820 --> 02:29.900
Halloween and they were also emitting

02:27.600 --> 02:29.900
light

02:36.180 --> 02:44.420
[Music]

02:41.930 --> 02:48.739
done

02:44.420 --> 02:55.940
first I'd open up myself then you were

02:48.739 --> 03:10.360
silent and then I think that tremendous

02:55.940 --> 03:10.360
work so much I will miss Theresa vanes

03:10.750 --> 03:16.970
happiness on fetched

03:13.810 --> 03:18.320
[Music]

03:16.970 --> 03:22.870
that

03:18.320 --> 03:25.870
[Music]

03:22.870 --> 03:25.870
20

03:26.850 --> 03:33.030
savage that lesson

03:36.270 --> 03:48.150
everything was fetched

03:38.090 --> 03:51.880
[Music]

03:48.150 --> 03:55.150
the Sahara is the blessing of the

03:51.880 --> 03:58.780
heavens I should say it has worked out

03:55.150 --> 04:03.390
so well it's very difficult to break the

03:58.780 --> 04:06.820
sahasrara and when I really broke it I

04:03.390 --> 04:10.090
didn't know that it would be that

04:06.820 --> 04:12.400
successful first I thought is still

04:10.090 --> 04:16.950
premature because there are many

04:12.400 --> 04:20.290
daksha's are still on this street

04:16.950 --> 04:23.169
selling their books and there are many

04:20.290 --> 04:24.669
fanatics who are calling themselves by

04:23.169 --> 04:27.700
the so-called religions they are

04:24.669 --> 04:33.280
following not the real religion of the

04:27.700 --> 04:37.330
earth but gradually it has taken its

04:33.280 --> 04:40.320
roots now let this truth take its root

04:37.330 --> 04:45.160
within yourself through your system and

04:40.320 --> 04:47.860
once this truth becomes absolutely the

04:45.160 --> 04:50.290
light that guides you the light that

04:47.860 --> 04:55.060
nourishes you the light that enlightens

04:50.290 --> 04:58.419
you and gives you a personality that has

04:55.060 --> 05:01.120
the light then only you should know that

04:58.419 --> 05:03.910
your sister arise completely enlightened

05:01.120 --> 05:07.180
by your spirit your face should be such

05:03.910 --> 05:09.490
that people should know that there's a

05:07.180 --> 05:14.800
personality was standing before you

05:09.490 --> 05:17.340
who is light this is how sahasrara is to

05:14.800 --> 05:17.340
be looked after

05:18.909 --> 05:22.139
please close your eyes

05:22.700 --> 05:30.350
as it is kundalini has risen quite high

05:25.670 --> 05:32.240
I feel it but it has to cross through

05:30.350 --> 05:36.810
the last point which is the seventh

05:32.240 --> 05:42.870
Center Collis Ostara to pierce through

05:36.810 --> 05:45.450

05:42.870 --> 05:46.380

05:57.780 --> 06:07.290
sahaja yoga that you don't open your

06:00.120 --> 06:09.210
eyes because if you open your eyes then
