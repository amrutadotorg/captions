00:13.873 --> 00:17.138
What a place ha? Beautiful!

00:21.910 --> 00:24.410
How did you all get here?

00:31.651 --> 00:34.151
More coming.

00:40.875 --> 00:43.375
Beautiful!

01:14.503 --> 01:17.003
Would you like a drink, Shri Mataji?

01:18.718 --> 01:21.218
Diet Coke would be fine.

01:33.017 --> 01:38.187
So we are with the nature here. So beautiful!

01:51.492 --> 01:56.971
The way it is planned you can see how the person who has planned it had the feel of the land,

01:56.979 --> 01:58.791
feel of the nature.

01:58.805 --> 02:05.141
How he has made up, by not destroying it.

02:05.148 --> 02:09.672
Whatever is there he used it,

02:09.678 --> 02:13.362
otherwise they would have put one
bulldozer and finished it off.

02:16.005 --> 02:24.149
The way it is planned shows he had feeling
for the land and he could understand.

02:24.159 --> 02:27.399
The way we look at nature also, is our own.

02:28.691 --> 02:32.391
The way we are inside, that’s how we look at nature.

02:32.391 --> 02:37.061
Nature is our friend absolutely;
it's working for us all the time.

02:37.067 --> 02:39.567
And we don’t do much for it.

02:41.747 --> 02:44.247
Look at these trees.

02:46.347 --> 02:50.475
They give shade, they give fruits.

02:50.482 --> 02:55.534
Whatever is possible for them, they do it.

02:55.546 --> 03:00.304
And when they are old, we use them for wood.

03:01.612 --> 03:04.112
All supportive to our life.

03:06.152 --> 03:12.232
But we must have feeling; otherwise, what’s
happening today is this ecological problem.

03:21.956 --> 03:29.476
And this is because we do not have
any feeling for the Mother Earth

03:29.486 --> 03:33.006
No feeling for the nature.

03:33.016 --> 03:39.326
We are really plundering them
and then the whole thing reacts.

03:45.119 --> 03:48.871
It's a kind of an aggression that

03:54.553 --> 03:57.801
you want to have so many
things at the same time

04:00.192 --> 04:06.580
That I have seen once, first
when we went to England,

04:06.610 --> 04:15.969
we never served any drinks in our house in India, but in England nobody would come to your house, so we had to organise.

04:15.969 --> 04:20.229
I told C.P. that “You better
do something about it.”

04:20.251 --> 04:26.347
So he went and bought some
books, how to organise.

04:26.367 --> 04:31.437
So first the question of tumblers.

04:31.443 --> 04:34.727
And so many types of tumblers you had to use.

04:34.727 --> 04:39.580
But we had to get about twenty-four of
the best crystal, the best crystal.

04:44.639 --> 04:50.569
Because for everything there's a different
type of a crystal that you have to have.

04:51.949 --> 04:56.448
I just thought that if you had some
silver, it would be much better.

04:56.448 --> 05:04.258
One glass of silver is sufficient, once for
all your lifetime, your children’s lifetime.

05:04.244 --> 05:08.108
Instead of that, all these things like crystal.

05:08.124 --> 05:14.793
But at least it was crystal, it was all right
because it was in a way, some sort of an art

05:17.003 --> 05:25.414
And then I learnt how they make, even in England, etching and all that. Beautiful in Scotland!

05:25.419 --> 05:30.016
English crystal also is nice.
The best is Czechoslovakian.

05:30.036 --> 05:40.366
All these things I learnt there with
that horrible sets of tumblers

05:40.393 --> 05:46.833
and you had to have the best quality,

05:46.845 --> 05:53.967
that's something, part of the prestige, you see.

05:53.971 --> 05:56.927
So somebody will come and just see the glass,

06:02.107 --> 06:03.931
slowly, you see.

06:03.937 --> 06:07.902
And the plates also, they’ll
come and just turn round.

06:09.352 --> 06:12.047
First I didn’t know what was happening.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.062
Because that’s not done in India,
I mean nobody’s bothered, you see.

06:15.072 --> 06:19.812
Only if there’s art they will appreciate, finished.

06:19.832 --> 06:24.932
We don’t have Saville Rows and all
that in India, so it's different.

06:24.962 --> 06:35.956
And that’s what I felt, that so many
tumblers are needed for one household.

06:35.956 --> 06:44.186
So, they are spending so much
money to buy all these varieties.

06:46.574 --> 06:51.342
But the worst is in America and
now they’re suffering from it.

06:51.352 --> 06:53.852
Even in plastic they have varieties.

06:53.852 --> 06:56.352
So you go to somebody’s house, so they…

07:11.325 --> 07:14.782
Must have been frightened the way we are sitting out here.

07:28.157 --> 07:39.349
So even in plastic they would, say, they have plastic tumblers which are just usable once.

07:39.371 --> 07:43.239
So they use once that, then it’s thrown out.

07:43.258 --> 07:48.099
Even in the drawing room, in a, say, restaurant or anything,

07:48.114 --> 07:50.404
even in their own drawing
rooms they have plastics.

07:50.404 --> 07:53.634
Can you imagine?

07:53.654 --> 07:58.034
And then they will use a lot
of paper, plastic things.

07:58.070 --> 08:01.480
They never have proper plates.

08:01.490 --> 08:05.490
They may be very rich but they
are always on the picnic, you see

08:05.504 --> 08:11.961
eating with the paper plates, using plastic things.

08:11.981 --> 08:14.481
But they are so proud of it.

08:14.481 --> 08:18.966
You see, this is a new one that
has come now in the plastic scene, nicely.

08:22.376 --> 08:25.501
What is so great about
this? It's after all plastic.

08:25.482 --> 08:28.305
It's new, you see, new.  New is the idea.

08:31.312 --> 08:36.855
Then everything has to be different. Every year.

08:36.864 --> 08:43.699
So this is the fashion this
year, so this kind of clothes

08:52.968 --> 08:55.931
There's a bomb scare or what?

09:04.159 --> 09:06.659
I feel they've come for lunch.

09:30.964 --> 09:36.960
Now they go on discarding this plastic
that they use, then dresses also.

09:36.977 --> 09:41.251
This is the fashion in Paris,
so that’s the dress comes in.

09:41.261 --> 09:45.901
Then the entrepreneurs have really
made us slaves out of that

09:45.915 --> 09:54.128
Now, if you are dressed differently they say,
“Oh, you are out of fashions, out of date.”

09:54.128 --> 09:57.165
So one lady came to see Me

09:57.144 --> 10:07.665
She had pants cut here, here, jeans
you see cut here, there, everywhere.

10:07.695 --> 10:12.195
I was just worried that if she
sits on me, it may give way

10:12.205 --> 10:14.705
The way it was cut.

10:14.705 --> 10:21.946
And a funny type of a shirt with all cuttings
everywhere, all the threads coming out.

10:21.923 --> 10:25.536
So I said, "Why are you dressed up like this?"

10:25.554 --> 10:28.054
"I'm up to date."

10:37.994 --> 10:41.108
So I asked her, "What about
Me?" "You're antique!"

10:44.790 --> 10:48.470
I said, "Antique is more
precious than up- to-date."

10:54.460 --> 11:01.134
So in India, we say that these people
have got now the desire to be beggars.

11:01.169 --> 11:02.904
With everything beggarish!

11:02.923 --> 11:09.606
The houses are beggarish, dresses are
beggarish, the hair are beggarish.

11:09.632 --> 11:12.132
To add up to it, drugs have come,

11:12.132 --> 11:21.790
so it’s all absolutely… you feel you are
in some sort of a fish market, smelling.

11:21.820 --> 11:27.370
The way people live is… I mean, they
are no way better than our slumming,

11:27.397 --> 11:30.630
the way they live, the way they eat,
the way they live their daily lives.

11:30.628 --> 11:34.271
They have money, not that
they don’t have money.

11:34.291 --> 11:37.930
Well they probably pay lots of money
for the clothes with the cuts in.

11:37.940 --> 11:42.860
Oh, they pay more for that. They pay more.

11:42.850 --> 11:49.660
But you go to any house you
see, England is worse this way,

11:49.646 --> 11:55.612
and when I was searching for a house,
we had to go from places to places.

11:55.645 --> 11:59.612
Quite big houses we were looking out for.

11:59.615 --> 12:05.472
Suddenly, you find two legs of
pants falling on you from somewhere

12:05.482 --> 12:08.612
and then some shirts coming on your faces.

12:08.609 --> 12:10.112
"What's this?"

12:10.115 --> 12:14.092
"Oh, these are old clothes we have, you see."

12:14.115 --> 12:15.002
"Since long?"

12:15.002 --> 12:17.502
"Oh no! This was last year's."

12:17.502 --> 12:19.577
"Why are you keeping them?"

12:19.577 --> 12:22.077
"What to do?"

12:22.097 --> 12:29.521
"Ah, better throw them away somewhere, give away to someone."

12:31.131 --> 12:34.526
"No, we are keeping them. Maybe
the fashion might come back."

12:34.526 --> 12:37.736
Piles and piles and piles.

12:37.756 --> 12:43.916
You get into a room and suddenly
you are on a pile of dirty clothes.

12:43.944 --> 12:48.833
So untidy! So horribly lousy!

12:48.843 --> 12:51.343
This is advancement.

12:51.343 --> 12:53.843
This is what we have progressed.

12:54.873 --> 13:00.317
So this funny greed of having
more and more and more and more,

13:00.317 --> 13:03.506
I mean, you can have, but
have something artistic

13:03.524 --> 13:06.846
so you won’t have too many
things, you’ll have few.

13:06.874 --> 13:11.307
If you try to have artistic things,
then you will have some few things

13:11.317 --> 13:13.817
But if you want to buy
plastic, there’s no end to it.

13:19.528 --> 13:26.558
The clothes are all artificial these days
and in that the fashions are changing.

13:26.575 --> 13:31.955
So we should not be slave of these entrepreneurs who are just befooling us all the time.

13:31.965 --> 13:34.465
In the market something comes up funny,

13:34.465 --> 13:38.235
transparent clothes, you see, made of plastic.

13:40.361 --> 13:44.637
Something absurd, you know sometimes
the clothes are very absurd.

13:44.647 --> 13:48.787
Like they had very tight
jeans once upon a time.

13:48.812 --> 13:52.857
And they tighten it by … they said
that you wear it and get into the tub.

13:52.888 --> 13:55.914
And when you come out they
just stick to your body.

13:55.930 --> 13:58.054
And then you bathe with it all the time.

13:58.054 --> 14:01.714
I don’t know if they bathe
also, that’s another point.

14:01.714 --> 14:06.044
Now, it’s such a funny
thing that with this,

14:06.059 --> 14:11.509
the ladies couldn’t get into the buses
so they were to be pushed in you see.

14:17.179 --> 14:20.866
But the worst was that they
developed varicose veins.

14:24.140 --> 14:27.876
So they would come to Me.
I said, “Why did you wear?”

14:27.898 --> 14:30.970
That was the fashion. Then
they started with the baggy ones,

14:30.990 --> 14:33.490
with the holes, holey pants.

14:33.490 --> 14:40.828
Like that, you see, moving from one to
another, having too many things of no value

14:40.839 --> 14:46.888
So the Sahaja yogis should understand
that we are friends of the nature.

14:46.893 --> 14:51.173
And whatever nature gives
us, we have to respect it

14:51.188 --> 14:56.983
Better wear natural clothes as far as possible.

14:56.996 --> 15:04.223
One natural shirt is better
than three unnatural ones,

15:04.238 --> 15:09.483
because you can breathe better, your skin
breathes better, you can wash it better.

15:09.492 --> 15:15.383
So best is to take to more natural
things. I think this trend is coming up,

15:15.390 --> 15:20.183
and that’s a very good trend, that
we should take to natural things.

15:20.185 --> 15:27.021
And when we take to natural things, there’s
one thing we cannot have too many of it.

15:27.026 --> 15:32.558
But if you start using something plastic,

15:32.564 --> 15:38.954
then there can be any number and that's
how you really torture the Mother Earth.

15:38.969 --> 15:41.989
First of all, you dig her out.

15:41.999 --> 15:44.709
Then you wear all these things.

15:44.716 --> 15:47.819
And they cannot be destroyed.

15:47.846 --> 15:50.346
There are mountains and mountains!

15:50.346 --> 15:54.139
Mountains and mountains of this
plastic if you go in America.

15:54.159 --> 15:58.785
Even in England I’ve seen
mountains, such a filthy sight.

15:58.777 --> 16:05.178
They can’t burn it. If you
put it in the sea, it floats.

16:05.187 --> 16:13.557
And wherever you go near all
these so - called very big cities,

16:13.557 --> 16:22.856
if you see the sea from the aeroplane
you find all littered up completely.

16:22.856 --> 16:32.343
So we are spoiling our beaches, we are
spoiling our homes and wasting our money.

16:33.805 --> 16:39.190
So these entrepreneurs have
no feelings for the nature.

16:39.194 --> 16:42.180
They never think what nature is like.

16:46.844 --> 16:49.344
When I wanted to build this Pratishthan,

16:49.344 --> 16:55.084
the five six architects from
India (they’re Sahaja yogis also)

16:55.104 --> 17:01.084
very well qualified but in
the Western manner, you know.

17:01.070 --> 17:12.004
So the design they made was some sort of a colonial style house with a platform all along,

17:12.034 --> 17:15.054
because the land was like this, you see.

17:15.054 --> 17:20.278
So they took the zero point as the highest.

17:20.279 --> 17:25.209
So you hang on a platform, for which
you have to pay enormous amount.

17:25.212 --> 17:32.647
I said, " All the way we have not come
to this place to hang in the air."

17:32.643 --> 17:34.758
They couldn't understand
what I was talking to them.

17:34.758 --> 17:37.258
I said, "I want to stick to the ground.

17:37.258 --> 17:40.873
I'll build the house on the ground."

17:40.888 --> 17:45.493
They said, "You have to make a topography,
you have to make this 'graphy,' that 'graphy.'"

17:45.503 --> 17:50.123
"This is very simple. What is this
'graphies' you are making? Just get to it."

17:52.934 --> 17:56.485
Luckily, they had gone all of them
on leave for about fifteen days.

17:56.503 --> 17:59.715
I changed the whole lot.

17:59.743 --> 18:04.620
And we would have been
hanging on twenty-two feet high.

18:04.628 --> 18:12.670
So I put one hall underneath that.

18:12.678 --> 18:17.996
And when you are moving down, you never
feel that you are going down that low.

18:19.424 --> 18:25.826
And it’s the personality of the nature
which is expressed in that house.

18:25.853 --> 18:28.082
It’s very interesting.

18:28.093 --> 18:31.242
You have seen Pratishthan?

18:31.243 --> 18:34.942
Did you feel that you are going too
much down? Nobody feels that way.

18:34.951 --> 18:39.342
No you don't actually feel
you are going down at all.

18:39.362 --> 18:42.292
Well it is.

18:42.312 --> 18:44.812
but after fifteen days they returned.

18:44.812 --> 18:49.012
All go! "What?" "How?"

18:49.015 --> 18:53.835
It's going to happen." I said, "Nothing
going to happen, take it from Me."

18:53.850 --> 18:59.265
I’ve used it the best way one has to use and
nothing is going to happen to your building.

18:59.302 --> 19:04.572
And they were after the builder. The builder said,
"Shri Mataji pays me, so I'm not bothered."

19:06.440 --> 19:09.922
And it all worked out so well. So well!

19:09.922 --> 19:15.230
So this is what it is in the...
it's also labour saving, you see.

19:15.224 --> 19:19.550
If you ask somebody, “Why
do you wear plastic?”

19:19.538 --> 19:23.362
they say, “You don’t have to press it.”

19:23.382 --> 19:27.000
But what’s the harm in pressing?

19:27.000 --> 19:33.440
You see there’s one cloth if you have to press it’s all right, it’s a good idea, or don’t press it.

19:33.447 --> 19:37.280
Don’t want to press, don’t press,
you’ll look quite neat, doesn’t matter.

19:37.280 --> 19:45.537
But what is the need, I don’t
understand, we have so many plastics?

19:45.576 --> 19:50.246
So Sahaja yogis should avoid
plastic things as far as possible,

19:50.247 --> 19:56.147
especially for children, one should be
careful not to make them wear plastics.

20:03.312 --> 20:05.372
All of them are here, isn't it?

20:05.372 --> 20:07.502
A gathering of the clans Mother!

20:07.503 --> 20:14.513
They must be going home. Either they are having a birthday party... or must be doing a training exercise.

20:14.523 --> 20:17.023
Or celebrating some rescue work.

20:20.003 --> 20:24.833
Why! Look at that (unclear)

20:28.053 --> 20:36.373
Shri Mataji, What about plastic toys
for the children? Is that a bad thing?

20:39.621 --> 20:42.228
Not very good for them.

20:42.241 --> 20:48.868
Also these plastic napkins you
use for children are not necessary.

20:48.891 --> 20:53.368
Then you see, you become unattentive to children also with that.

20:56.898 --> 21:02.709
I mean, toys they play for a while but still
sometimes they put it in the mouth and…

21:09.380 --> 21:17.210
If you see, children are more fond of things
made out of cloth or made out of wood.

21:17.214 --> 21:21.004
They like it. They like the feel of it.

21:21.014 --> 21:30.516
You put five plastic things and one thing made out of wood or made out of cloth, they’ll pick up the cloth one.

21:30.516 --> 21:35.076
They like the feel of the
smoothness of it, you see.

21:35.063 --> 21:41.256
They’re very expensive here, I agree,
but in India they’re very cheap

21:41.263 --> 21:44.376
This time in Madras I don’t know
if you picked up something or not,

21:44.393 --> 21:46.893
lots of things were there for sale for children.

21:50.213 --> 21:56.057
You see, they wouldn’t stop My car anywhere, I
was on the run, otherwise I would have bought.

21:56.082 --> 22:02.192
The wooden toys for girls are
very good in India. Beautiful!

22:02.207 --> 22:04.707
Also for boys!

22:06.873 --> 22:13.471
But the plastic toys which are covered
with cloth are all right, not so dangerous.

22:20.301 --> 22:24.522
Plastic is something that
penetrates into everything.

22:24.521 --> 22:27.021
Into everything!

22:28.971 --> 22:33.330
We also give too many toys to our children.

22:33.331 --> 22:39.580
In our days, a girl would have
only one doll or two dolls now.

22:39.589 --> 22:42.089
But now the plastic toys,

22:42.089 --> 22:49.277
the whole room is filled with it, I mean you have to just wade through to find out your child in all this.

22:49.273 --> 22:56.530
So many toys! Perhaps maybe we avoid
having relationship with our children.

22:58.600 --> 23:04.714
We don’t talk to them, we have no time,
so give them some toys, stop them, there.

23:04.714 --> 23:07.214
Sort of a diversion.

23:08.254 --> 23:11.990
And that’s how we don’t know our children at all.

23:12.014 --> 23:18.180
Too many toys. And the toys also now are coming out

23:18.193 --> 23:22.880
in such a way that’s another slavery because
on the television they’ll advertise it.

23:22.897 --> 23:27.670
Your children will be after you, "I want that toy."

23:27.678 --> 23:35.367
There was a bear, they took it
out, which had a birth date.

23:35.357 --> 23:48.885
And so they would celebrate the birthday and
all the bears were invited you see, for that.

23:48.886 --> 23:56.477
It’s so funny, isn’t it, that
children should be given such ideas?

23:56.488 --> 24:03.675
Because there’s no rapport. If the parents have a rapport with children, children won’t need so much.

24:03.674 --> 24:10.394
You must read some proper stories to
be told to children, talk to them.

24:10.404 --> 24:15.634
If you keep company with them, I don’t
think they’ll ask for toys, too many toys.

24:15.664 --> 24:20.924
They would not. They’ll be very satisfied,
because most of them are realised souls.

24:20.909 --> 24:30.295
So talk to them in such a manner that they develop their spirituality rather than all these materialistic things.

24:32.795 --> 24:37.575
I have found that we don’t spend
much time with our children.

24:37.589 --> 24:39.825
That’s why they are like this.

24:39.839 --> 24:45.654
We had such a problem. I was telling you about
these wise children we had in our school there.

24:45.664 --> 24:51.828
The teachers were mad. They didn’t know what to do.They said, "Within one month's time, we will give up."

24:51.839 --> 24:54.339
They said, "We can't do this any more."

25:00.039 --> 25:08.230
The relationship between the child and parents
should be very sensible and of respect.

25:08.216 --> 25:16.869
Because I have seen that children go on
asking questions, “Why? Why?” like that.

25:16.880 --> 25:19.380
You see, it’s kind of an
aggressive nature, that’s all.

25:19.380 --> 25:23.470
They don’t want to know anything.
Just go on asking questions.

25:23.476 --> 25:29.902
At that time you have to tell them, “You are not to know this. There’s no need for you to know.”

25:29.910 --> 25:32.410
You have to shut them down.

25:32.410 --> 25:38.706
The quieter child is much
better, who observes, who learns.

25:38.706 --> 25:44.757
But the one who is aggressive becomes
later on a very wild personality.

25:44.770 --> 25:47.527
So to see that your child is not aggressive.

25:47.530 --> 25:51.947
They are exhausting. These
children are absolutely exhausting.

25:51.943 --> 25:55.068
This time I went to Rome.

25:58.178 --> 26:03.138
And I bought some sweets for them.

26:03.148 --> 26:05.648
Some chocolates.

26:05.658 --> 26:15.983
So when I sat down I said, "Now these
children, some lollipops and chocolates."

26:15.996 --> 26:18.496
So they all rushed on to Me,

26:18.496 --> 26:22.112
pushing their hands like this.

26:22.146 --> 26:25.552
I said, "This is not to be done, you
are not beggars. Are you beggars?"

26:25.552 --> 26:27.812
Then they sat back.

26:27.832 --> 26:29.462
They are not beggars.

26:29.462 --> 26:33.912
But say in India you try this, no
child will push forward this way.

26:33.922 --> 26:37.242
If you try to give he’ll feel
shy, he’ll look at the mother.

26:37.232 --> 26:47.511
Should he take it or not? But this comes only
because of the rapport we have with children.

26:47.507 --> 26:52.361
How do we have rapport with them?

26:52.376 --> 27:00.025
See now, you take them to the nature
here and see them, how they behave,

27:00.045 --> 27:03.195
what is their style,

27:03.203 --> 27:05.970
what is their treatment?

27:05.993 --> 27:10.960
Instead of making them
run about like mad

27:10.977 --> 27:16.683
or taking out some flowers or doing
some sort of an aggressive act,

27:16.693 --> 27:19.723
just make them sit down. Tell
them, “Now what is this flower?

27:19.733 --> 27:22.233
Do you know the name of this flower?

27:22.233 --> 27:25.006
Now this one, do you know what is that flower?"

27:25.014 --> 27:30.936
I mean many parents don't know themselves.
I don't know if they can explain.

27:30.953 --> 27:33.453
Then, "What is this tree?"

27:33.453 --> 27:34.996
Look at the nature.

27:35.003 --> 27:39.564
Put the attention of the
children on to something

27:39.573 --> 27:45.584
which will make them more
contented and more deeper.

27:45.583 --> 27:49.711
Instead of that, as soon as they see
the space they just start running.

27:49.724 --> 27:51.906
You don’t know what to do with them.

27:51.904 --> 27:57.746
It is because you have not taught them how to be concentrated on something very interesting.

27:57.746 --> 28:01.564
Now see, I am sitting here. I am
seeing, watching these stones.

28:01.566 --> 28:03.776
Even this will be in My head.

28:03.786 --> 28:07.630
What a beautiful fibre this is!

28:07.650 --> 28:12.170
This is nature. And if once children start appreciating it,

28:12.167 --> 28:18.790
their attention will be more on this
than on something nonsensical, you see.

28:32.021 --> 28:38.563
So a rapport needs to be established
and an understanding of the children.

28:38.586 --> 28:43.023
An appreciation when they do
something good, you must appreciate.

28:43.053 --> 28:47.373
And when they are doing something, mostly they
do wrong things just to attract your attention.

28:47.373 --> 28:54.601
If you don’t pay any attention to that  just distract
their attention, to something else, it’s very easy.

28:54.627 --> 29:01.305
For example, now if you are going to somebody’s
house, the children are going with us;

29:01.335 --> 29:05.785
before going we tell them, “See now,
you have to behave there properly,

29:05.785 --> 29:09.165
otherwise they’ll think that your parents are no good.

29:09.171 --> 29:15.634
Now we go there. You should not,
in no way try to misbehave.

29:15.634 --> 29:18.814
Shouldn't ask for anything. Just keep quiet."

29:18.815 --> 29:22.317
So first of all, you tell them how to behave.

29:22.327 --> 29:27.317
Now when they go there and they behave properly when you come back, you have to tell them,

29:27.315 --> 29:31.397
“This is tremendous. You have been so good.

29:31.376 --> 29:38.168
You behaved so well, it's really very good I'm so
proud of you. So next time even better.

29:41.773 --> 29:50.645
Then you have to tell them about
their dignity, about what they are.

29:50.646 --> 29:53.525
And also the dignity of the nature.

29:53.546 --> 30:00.165
“See how dignified the tree is. How it
is standing there for giving us shade.”

30:00.185 --> 30:10.695
So they develop that feeling within them. If you do not have feeling for the nature, you cannot stop these ecological problems.

30:10.723 --> 30:13.223
That's important, very important.

30:16.483 --> 30:21.401
Luckily, with Sahaja Yoga,
Hamid has done some research

30:21.399 --> 30:27.900
and he has worked on the trees near Austria.

30:27.900 --> 30:37.296
here’s a very beautiful mountainous area, much
higher than this, between Germany and Austria.

30:39.157 --> 30:43.447
There used to be some sort
of wasps, were really fatal.

30:43.500 --> 30:54.021
Now they have all disappeared and the trees are
crumbling down with this acid rain and getting
completely destroyed.

30:54.021 --> 30:58.364
So the government asked him to
do some experiment with them.

30:58.372 --> 31:07.172
So, he took My vibrated water in a puja and he mixed
it with other water, put it everywhere.

31:07.176 --> 31:15.544
So he said, “All the trees about
sixty years of age didn’t react much.

31:15.556 --> 31:25.292
But below that, they all reacted
and they started looking healthier.”

31:25.312 --> 31:27.812
But he said still, the speed was not there.

31:27.812 --> 31:34.631
So there were lots of these
badges from America left over

31:34.683 --> 31:38.671
So he went and pushed them into every tree.

31:38.686 --> 31:47.526
And he said, “I went there after six months
and the whole thing was changed, vibrated
and it's all green, so beautiful.

31:49.514 --> 31:52.654
It’s a remarkable thing to happen.

31:53.704 --> 32:00.724
So I think My picture must be giving
balance or something to this acid rain,

32:00.742 --> 32:08.552
or it nourishes trees. The vibrations after
all, vibrations do nourish everything,

32:08.562 --> 32:11.062
and I don’t know what happened to the acid rain.

32:12.832 --> 32:15.332
It’s very different.

32:16.902 --> 32:24.104
We can try that everywhere,
vibrated water and these badges.

32:24.124 --> 32:28.144
Even the rings have done great works.

32:28.159 --> 32:32.974
He had a problem because they don’t
have well as we have in India.

32:33.001 --> 32:46.496
They only have those taps. So he removed the joining ring and put his ring inside that, and then he joined it.

32:46.514 --> 32:53.520
With that ring only, it worked
wonders, can you imagine?

32:53.511 --> 32:55.159
Water was passing through it.

32:55.165 --> 32:57.665
Just imagine.

32:59.217 --> 33:07.716
Maybe the ring was emitting the vibrations and the water which went over it carried the vibrations.

33:07.716 --> 33:11.463
Unbelievable things have happened. Unbelievable!

33:14.003 --> 33:27.399
So for us it is important to understand what
is our status and what is our position.

33:27.389 --> 33:29.889
We are something very different from others.

33:29.889 --> 33:33.909
We have so much capacities.

33:33.919 --> 33:45.205
So we must understand what we can do to
really improve the conditions around us,

33:45.205 --> 33:47.705
our children, everything

33:47.705 --> 33:53.555
because now you have that
vital force which you can use.

33:53.567 --> 33:58.866
But many Sahaja yogis are such, they do not understand

33:58.876 --> 34:06.936
that Sahaja Yoga is not for only for your
personal cleanliness or for your personal ascent,

34:06.958 --> 34:14.645
but for the ascent of the whole
universe, of the whole people.

34:14.655 --> 34:17.795
Anywhere there’s a Sahaja yogi you can make it out.

34:17.805 --> 34:28.396
Once I was going in a village and I saw a
beautiful, very beautiful field of corn.

34:28.406 --> 34:35.051
Such beautiful corn, such thick, thick seeds in it.

34:35.051 --> 34:37.551
So I said, "Whose field?"

34:37.551 --> 34:40.859
I asked the Sahaja yogi, I said, "Whose field is this?"

34:40.867 --> 34:43.367
He said, "This is mine."

34:45.237 --> 34:54.217
"What did you do?" "I just got one coconut
vibrated by You and put it my well."

34:56.987 --> 34:59.648
All these miracles are happening.

34:59.669 --> 35:05.838
Something, when I was building Pratishthan
you see, we didn’t have water or well there.

35:05.863 --> 35:08.868
So the neighbour said, “My well
is lying here, you can use it,

35:08.891 --> 35:12.194
but it only can work for a few days.

35:12.214 --> 35:15.934
You'll have to arrange for water to build the house.

35:15.954 --> 35:18.734
I said, “All right.”

35:18.725 --> 35:27.200
So the first thing Sahaja yogis did was to put
My vibrated water in that well and one coconut.

35:27.240 --> 35:39.562
Suddenly that well started. And while building, you see there’s a big ball kept there, to suck the water up.

35:39.562 --> 35:43.422
The ball was hanging in the air,
but still the water was coming.

35:43.439 --> 35:48.292
And the whole of that Pratishthan was built with that water.

35:48.292 --> 35:54.295
We never had to buy any water and
everybody was amazed. How can it be?

35:54.295 --> 36:02.208
But the water from, I don’t know from
where that source, but just sucked in.

36:02.228 --> 36:06.318
Till we finished the house,
there was water in that well.

36:06.347 --> 36:12.558
Then the fellow said, “I want this
well for my own use."  He'll use it for himself.

36:12.594 --> 36:15.094
Immediately it dried up.

36:15.094 --> 36:17.164
Touched the bottom.

36:17.174 --> 36:20.004
So he came to Me and he said, "I
don't know what has happened.

36:20.034 --> 36:22.804
There's no water, not a drop."

36:22.838 --> 36:25.338
I said, "Really?"

36:25.338 --> 36:28.288
"It's dried out."

36:28.318 --> 36:34.088
So I said, "All right, you take one coconut."
He said,"Your coconut is lying there."

36:34.117 --> 36:39.510
I said, "Take another one." It wouldn't.
He took another one, it wouldn't

36:39.520 --> 36:44.810
Then I said, "All right, you get your
realisation." We gave him realisation, this that.

36:44.820 --> 36:48.099
Then he said, "I would like to sell this well to You."

36:48.130 --> 36:50.630
He sold it to Me, again the water came in.

36:52.620 --> 36:58.362
Poor fellow, now he didn’t know what to do with
that. So we bought that well. Hari knows about it.

36:58.382 --> 37:03.532
We bought that well and now
that well is again all right.

37:03.523 --> 37:09.225
So the nature is a great friend of Sahaja
yogis. This is what I am trying to say.

37:09.236 --> 37:11.956
Whatever you want, it will work out for you.

37:11.976 --> 37:14.476
See how the rain came.

37:15.526 --> 37:18.026
Least expected at this time.

37:18.026 --> 37:23.476
You needed it and when I was in the plane
only, I saw all the thundering going on.

37:25.969 --> 37:43.416
In Perth, when we went to the place where they have built a very beautiful cottage, it was all parched and all brown.

37:43.440 --> 37:47.406
When I came it was all green, absolutely green.

37:47.417 --> 37:56.240
They said in the newspaper it was, it’s a very
rare thing that such a rain has come at this time.

37:56.236 --> 38:01.600
People don’t remember. Frank told me he doesn’t remember his lifetime that rain was there.

38:01.596 --> 38:06.778
But what a rain, it was torrential. It was torrential.

38:06.792 --> 38:10.583
So then he was worried, Stephen was worried

38:10.583 --> 38:13.463
that, “Mother I know, but the rain may stop

38:13.473 --> 38:15.571
people coming to the program.”

38:15.593 --> 38:18.093
I said, “No, you’ll see that.”

38:18.093 --> 38:21.403
When we reached there, it was all full.

38:21.403 --> 38:24.663
And the people were seekers whom we had.

38:24.673 --> 38:27.173
And when I asked them, “Have you any questions?”

38:27.173 --> 38:29.963
No questions.

38:29.963 --> 38:33.333
They just wanted their realisation.

38:33.343 --> 38:39.995
So we could get the seekers,
absolutely who wants realisation.

38:40.001 --> 38:45.130
And we got the rain as well. So
rain has done double work for us.

38:51.692 --> 38:54.192
Are we all going to have lunch here?

38:57.672 --> 39:01.762
We are going to the park down by the lake. The park we travelled to.

39:01.762 --> 39:04.262
There we have to go?

39:05.099 --> 39:09.362
We should go now, because talks cannot fill your bellies.

39:14.232 --> 39:16.732
CUT IN VIDEO

39:16.732 --> 39:22.002
Once we were going in the car and when I got down,
one of the Sahaja yogis said there was a Garuda.

39:22.002 --> 39:26.592
Couldn't see it. See Mother, see, there is a Garuda.

39:26.597 --> 39:30.008
Got out from the car and I looked up.

39:30.005 --> 39:38.554
Really, there was a cloud just like a Garuda going sideways. Just like a Garuda!

39:38.554 --> 39:44.024
You see, on the way I never saw this gentleman. (unclear

39:44.054 --> 39:47.491
It’s beautiful and they photographed it.

39:54.401 --> 40:01.194
You haven’t seen a photograph of Mine in Brahmapuri?

40:01.216 --> 40:05.784
You’ve seen that one? He must have
shown you, Yogi had it with him.

40:05.784 --> 40:11.324
Where with the rainbow, My face is there.

40:13.344 --> 40:15.844
Must get copy of all these, I think.

40:15.820 --> 40:18.320
I think we have got a copy of that here in Australia.

40:18.320 --> 40:21.886
You have? And the one in which, in a photograph…

40:21.886 --> 40:23.806
Oh, that’s an amazing photograph

40:23.816 --> 40:26.316
That you haven’t got. You’ve got that?

40:26.316 --> 40:30.766
We got one in India. That is an amazing photograph.

40:32.482 --> 40:44.234
It’s the one of Ganesha. With the flare of the light from the camera, it’s created a complete Ganesha in the glass of the photograph.

40:44.226 --> 40:52.778
What surprises Me how at that
right moment you see these.

40:56.695 --> 40:59.195
How at that right moment they
take the photograph.

41:04.487 --> 41:09.700
Must be something, some sort of a communication, because nobody takes photograph of a rainbow.

41:12.520 --> 41:18.758
The first photograph that appeared in the sky, they told Me there was a funny thing happening in the sky.

41:18.751 --> 41:21.251
I said, “What happened?”

41:21.251 --> 41:28.057
First one cloud became very bright, (full of vibrations ?)

41:28.044 --> 41:35.587
and it started forming a shape of Ganesha, so we took the photograph.

41:35.599 --> 41:42.058
And then from there, lots of rays sort of going on the sides.

41:42.068 --> 41:48.494
And when the whole thing disappeared, then the peace came down.

41:51.324 --> 42:02.418
But so to attract that attention also, I’m sure this Paramchaitanya must be working some tricks,

42:02.438 --> 42:06.678
otherwise how at the right time you take the photograph.

42:08.552 --> 42:13.828
Yes because, so many photos are taken..

42:15.214 --> 42:17.714
Some get the thing.

42:21.250 --> 42:26.232
In one photograph Ganesha is just standing
behind Me. Absolutely. His blue body and eyes.

42:26.248 --> 42:31.012
But one can doubt it. One can think that
it’s a stuff one kept there or something.

42:31.003 --> 42:32.872
I mean, if you have to talk.

42:32.872 --> 42:36.902
But this one is too much to have a photograph.

42:39.703 --> 42:43.893
This Paramchaitanya is trying all
tricks to convince you about Me.

42:43.898 --> 42:46.625
We are already convinced, you see.

42:46.645 --> 42:50.905
But I don’t know about the world at large.

42:50.905 --> 42:55.075
They’ll sit down and find out, this is this, this is this.

42:55.921 --> 43:01.581
You know the famous photo series of the
rays of light, You know that very old one.

43:01.581 --> 43:06.411
There was somebody taking a photograph
at the same time, and it wasn’t on it.

43:06.397 --> 43:10.548
There are so many like that.

43:10.533 --> 43:14.557
In Calcutta you see, they were taking My photographs

43:14.557 --> 43:20.338
and Talwar’s daughter-in-law just prayed, “Mother, I want to have some miraculous photograph.”

43:20.338 --> 43:24.138
So the sun and moon both appeared behind Me.

43:36.958 --> 43:42.083
The photographs where there are angels and
you see all the deities sitting behind Me

43:42.102 --> 43:47.943
was taken by a boy who was in first year medicine.

43:47.951 --> 43:52.175
Brought it to Me. He said, “I don’t
know what’s wrong with my camera.

43:52.186 --> 43:56.835
I don’t know what has come out is this.”

43:56.835 --> 44:01.716
He said, “Mother, I am sorry. You see, I don’t
know. Just this funny thing has come out,

44:01.717 --> 44:04.217
You see, the thing I can’t understand.”

44:04.213 --> 44:05.767
Wanted to take My photograph,

44:05.767 --> 44:09.900
I have come up so little as that
and all the deities sitting there.

44:09.890 --> 44:13.900
He couldn’t understand that how it happened.

44:13.899 --> 44:18.759
And he had lots of them, one after
another, which you have seen all of you.
