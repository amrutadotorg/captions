WEBVTT

00:00:04.148 --> 00:00:06.648
Sit down, sit down, you all sit down.

00:00:17.927 --> 00:00:23.647
Come forward a little, people can
sit behind. Or come here from behind.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:50.277
Nice! That's so good. Yes

00:00:56.421 --> 00:01:03.401
Unh? What do you say?

00:01:04.082 --> 00:01:13.532
Sukanya - There was also a movie Sukanya
of Ravindra Babu that was shown recently.
Ravindra Babu's Sukanya.

00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:19.851
How a little girl serves the master
with such love and affection

00:01:22.332 --> 00:01:30.312
It's very good. These ideals should
be kept for our women - they are
very important.

00:01:34.393 --> 00:01:37.546
Everyone has forgotten - what to say?

00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:52.226
Interviewer: Mataji, what is Sahaja Yoga?
Can You tell us something briefly for this?

00:01:52.226 --> 00:01:57.802
Shri Mataji: Sahaj Yog? 'Saha' means
'with', 'ja' means 'born'.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:09.190
Sahaja means, born with you
is the right to get to your yoga.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.260
Yoga means the union with the Divine
- means atmasakshatkar.

00:02:13.334 --> 00:02:22.594
So everybody has a birthright to get to
his yoga, that is, your union with
the Divine. Alright?

00:02:22.987 --> 00:02:26.567
Interviewer: So Sahaja Yoga means born
with yoga?

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:30.952
Shri Mataji: Born with the right to have
the yoga - Sahaja

00:02:30.952 --> 00:02:35.900
Sahaja yoga means by which -
also Sahaja also you know in Sanskrit

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.744
Interviewer: Means simple
Shri Mataji: Simple. It is spontaneous,
spontaneous.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:46.955
Whatever is living is Sahaja.
Our breathing is Sahaja.

00:02:46.955 --> 00:02:56.314
The flower gives the fruit sahaja, the
seed is sprouted sahaja. All living
processes are sahaja.

00:02:56.314 --> 00:03:01.307
In this way also it means a living
process of yoga.

00:03:01.307 --> 00:03:03.298
Interviewer: A living process of yoga.

00:03:03.298 --> 00:03:06.777
Shri Mataji: For yoga. Through the
living forces -

00:03:06.987 --> 00:03:14.867
living process of yoga through living
forces within ourselves. Alright?

00:03:14.867 --> 00:03:22.655
Interviewer: Is it some - I attended
last yesterday's evening Your discourse.

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:27.617
Is Sahaja yoga means some of the
mudras or hand gestures?

00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:37.533
You told to raise the left hand up and
right hand down or to keep palm on an
earthen lamp, You told yesterday.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:42.200
Shri Mataji: Yes - this is not a mudra
but this is how you have to handle

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.434
your Sympathetic Nervous System
on both the sides.

00:03:45.481 --> 00:03:49.101
We have got Sympathetic Nervous
system on left and right

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:57.199
and how to clear it out, how to clear
out - just like electrical mechanism

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:03.610
how to clear out, is that you put the
light infront of your finger-tips

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:09.521
then what happens that the light is
the one which drives out all the
jadta(inertia) in you

00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:15.533
and then passes through here, comes
to this side and goes to the
Mother Earth.

00:04:15.753 --> 00:04:21.733
It's just a scientific thing but Science
of the Divine.

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:24.887
Interviewer: But if anyone suffers from
mental anxiety or depression

00:04:24.887 --> 00:04:27.060
Shri Mataji: Yes, it's the best.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.675
Interviewer: If he does this thing to just
to [UNCLEAR - SHOW?] with the arms

00:04:31.675 --> 00:04:34.441
[UNCLEAR - SHOW?] with the palm of
the hands just like the earthen lamp

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:39.068
Shri Mataji: Yes, left hand - they are
left-handed. There's a left hand
problem, yes, left side problem

00:04:39.068 --> 00:04:40.420
Interviewer: Left side

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.995
Shri Mataji: That is mental all this kind,
so called mental - English language
is a funny one,

00:04:44.995 --> 00:04:49.358
you see, you see, better depend on
Sanskrit. Whatever the problem of
the 'manasa'

00:04:49.358 --> 00:04:54.191
whatever is the problem of the mind,
that problem is to be solved by left hand.

00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:55.617
Interviewer: 'Mana'

00:04:55.617 --> 00:05:01.959
Shri Mataji: Yes, and the problem
of intellect and ego and the
physical by the right side.
Interviewer: Okay.

00:05:03.739 --> 00:05:08.399
Interviewer: And what are the
connections of (saat) seven chakra

00:05:08.399 --> 00:05:12.728
because I saw a picture, illustration of
(saat)seven chakra there on the dias?

00:05:12.728 --> 00:05:16.760
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes. You see, these are
the subtle centres within ourselves.

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:22.887
When the Kundalini rises through them,
then She connects them, not only
connects them

00:05:22.887 --> 00:05:28.523
but also establishes the awakening
of the Deities on those chakras.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:33.869
And these are the Deities, which look
after those different chakras.

00:05:33.869 --> 00:05:39.712
Interviewer: So in Sahaja Yoga we should
try to stimulate our chakras by handling
the Kundalini.

00:05:39.712 --> 00:05:41.874
Shri Mataji: Yes. That's what it is.

00:05:42.764 --> 00:05:46.544
Interviewer: How long it will take
to achieve that that that?

00:05:46.544 --> 00:05:52.240
Shri Mataji: Some people take in no time
but you see, the city people are
rather complicated

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.747
they take more time so we cannot
say how much time

00:05:56.747 --> 00:06:02.547
but it is just, what happens is that,
you get it - that's all I can say.

00:06:02.547 --> 00:06:07.180
Interviewer: Mataji is Sahaja Yoga is
connected with our Patanjal Yoga?

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:12.774
Shri Mataji: Of course. Patanjali is the
same but Patanjali was practised
at a time

00:06:12.774 --> 00:06:19.919
when we had a this, Chaturashram,
you see, vyavastha in our country,

00:06:19.919 --> 00:06:23.871
where we had brahmacharis staying
in the ashrams

00:06:23.871 --> 00:06:29.332
and so much so the brahmacharya was
that the 'gotra' is nothing but the
universities

00:06:29.332 --> 00:06:33.501
and you could not marry in the sagotra
as you till today - so you can imagine

00:06:33.501 --> 00:06:35.945
how much was the brahmacharya
in those days.

00:06:35.945 --> 00:06:41.651
And in under those circumstances they
practised yoga in the way that they

00:06:41.651 --> 00:06:49.270
selected some people, raised their
Kundalini, tried to clear their chakras
one by one, gradually,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:58.210
because it was a gradual process. But
now, the time is of a jet age, so we have
to have a jet Kundalini

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:03.013
and we have to give it to the masses.
The time has come to give to the
masses - not for one individual.

00:07:03.013 --> 00:07:04.711
Interviewer: So You need to modify it?

00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:09.407
Shri Mataji: Yes, I have magnified it you
can say, that it can be used by all
the masses.

00:07:09.407 --> 00:07:13.526
Unless and until any discovery is used
by the masses it is of no use.

00:07:13.526 --> 00:07:20.484
But the time has come. This is the same
Blossom time, I call it, but as the Bible
says, it is the Last Judgment

00:07:20.904 --> 00:07:25.187
and also Koran says, 'This is the
Resurrection time, Punarutthan,'

00:07:25.187 --> 00:07:32.941
that your fingers and your toes and your
hands will give witness about you to
others - this is the time.

00:07:32.941 --> 00:07:35.180
All of them has said it, 'This is the time.'

00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:39.681
Interviewer: But Sahaj Yoga then it has
the root connection of the Patanjali
yoga.

00:07:39.681 --> 00:07:43.070
Shri Mataji: Of course. I mean, it's the
ancient thing, no doubt.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:47.575
Patanjali used the same thing but he
used a gradual method because that
was a slow method like

00:07:47.575 --> 00:07:51.887
a bullock cart was used in those days,
right? Now we are using motor cars

00:07:51.887 --> 00:07:56.991
so that is there but the time has come.
This time has been predicted in a
Nadi Granth.

00:07:56.991 --> 00:08:03.168
If you can get hold of Nadi Granth
written by Bhrigu Muni, long time back
that, 'Such a time is going to come.'

00:08:03.985 --> 00:08:12.265
Interviewer: Mataji, here asanas and
pranayamas are very popular, we do
the postures

00:08:12.265 --> 00:08:17.474
but in Sahaja yoga is there any place
of doing the Yoga postures or?

00:08:17.474 --> 00:08:24.135
Shri Mataji: No, no, we do it, you see,
whatever is needed. Here, you see, this
is a very half-baked knowledge

00:08:24.135 --> 00:08:31.172
and what happens that like a any half
baked person will take all the medicines
from the medicine box

00:08:31.172 --> 00:08:35.794
like that they go on doing it without
understanding whatever is suitable
to a personality.

00:08:35.794 --> 00:08:41.789
Every personality is different. Moreover,
when the Kundalini rises, you know at
what chakra it is stopping

00:08:41.789 --> 00:08:47.534
and that is the chakra you work out.
Supposing now, there is a chakra in the
centre heart, we call it,

00:08:47.534 --> 00:08:52.657
it is caught up, then there is an asana
you can do. Some people have to do

00:08:52.657 --> 00:08:56.945
Paschimotasana, if their nabhi is
caught up but all these asanas are done

00:08:56.945 --> 00:09:03.070
according to the need of the chakras,
which, wherever is the Kundalini stopping

00:09:03.070 --> 00:09:09.165
but the modern yoga is so funny, that it
is just, they do all kinds of things,
left and right

00:09:09.165 --> 00:09:12.280
without understanding what's the
matter with them; It very indiscreet

00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.750
and it causes problems, it can
give a heart attack.

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:18.816
Interviewer: So all these, only those
asanas are important which are
connected with

00:09:18.816 --> 00:09:24.544
Shri Mataji: No, we use all the asanas
but which are related to some sort
of a problem within us

00:09:24.544 --> 00:09:27.690
otherwise we don't do any asanas.
Interviewer: Pranayam

00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:32.355
Shri Mataji: Pranayam also is alright for
certain type of people but not for all.

00:09:32.355 --> 00:09:35.174
Those who have certain problems
can do pranayama

00:09:35.174 --> 00:09:38.786
but everybody does pranayama they'll
develop into big problems -

00:09:38.786 --> 00:09:42.386
they will never get realization also.
It's very imbalanced.

00:09:42.386 --> 00:09:45.105
Interviewer: So Pranayama helps but it
is not the central point.

00:09:45.105 --> 00:09:49.892
Shri Mataji: No, no - pranayama helps
according related to the chakras.

00:09:49.892 --> 00:09:55.480
If supposing your right heart is catching,
then you have to do pranayama

00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:59.431
but which side - it's a very
complicated thing. It is to be adjusted.

00:09:59.431 --> 00:10:02.910
That's why they said, it's to be done by
an enlightened guru.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.802
Patanjali would not allow anybody who
is not enlightened to do all these things.

00:10:07.802 --> 00:10:10.295
Here everybody is teaching everything,
isn't it?

00:10:11.956 --> 00:10:15.736
Interviewer: One thing I have noticed
that everyone here, all devotees

00:10:15.736 --> 00:10:18.152
they are always sitting with their
palms upwards.

00:10:18.152 --> 00:10:22.547
Shri Mataji: Yes, because this is a
Sympathetic Nervous systems. You see,

00:10:22.547 --> 00:10:27.672
these are one, two, three, four, five, six,
seven - alright, these are seven chakras

00:10:27.672 --> 00:10:35.575
and these seven chakras get vibrations.
This is the All-Pervading Power, you
see everywhere

00:10:35.575 --> 00:10:40.220
and when they put their hands like this,
this power starts flowing into them.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:46.914
In My presence specially it works faster.
So they want to feel it because it
gives you energy, vitality.

00:10:46.914 --> 00:10:51.706
These are three powers in this One
Power so they want to take this,

00:10:51.706 --> 00:10:54.877
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati
and Maheshwari - all the powers

00:10:54.877 --> 00:11:03.111
are flowing in this atmosphere and
they just want to take that and absorb.

00:11:03.942 --> 00:11:09.320
Interviewer: Yesterday You strongly
[UNCLEAR] against alcoholism and
cigarette smoking.

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:15.142
Shri Mataji: Did I? Normally I avoid but
that was the last day so I said I
better tell them

00:11:15.142 --> 00:11:18.858
Sahaj Yogini: It indeed is very correct
You did. It needed to be told.

00:11:18.858 --> 00:11:25.374
Interviewer: So, do You think that Sahaja
Yoga also will help to eradicate the
drug addiction?

00:11:25.374 --> 00:11:31.863
Shri Mataji: Of course it does. It takes
away all your habits because, you see,
Spirit cannot have any habits.

00:11:31.863 --> 00:11:37.167
It takes away everything. Overnight
people have given up drugs in the West
- overnight.

00:11:39.521 --> 00:11:46.101
Interviewer: So, did you start preaching
Sahaja Yoga from London?

00:11:46.273 --> 00:11:49.646
Shri Mataji: No, in India only.
Interviewer: In India. Which year?

00:11:49.646 --> 00:11:56.336
Shri Mataji: That was in 1970. And then
My husband got elected to this job.

00:11:56.336 --> 00:12:06.290
He got elected to this job of Secretary
General of International Maritime
Organization.

00:12:07.248 --> 00:12:09.708
He was Chairman of Shipping
Corporation,

00:12:09.708 --> 00:12:15.942
then he became the Secretary General
of International Maritime Organization.

00:12:15.942 --> 00:12:22.522
It's like, you see, there are 14 Secretary
Generals in the U.N. - one of the
agencies

00:12:22.522 --> 00:12:30.355
Like W.H.O. is one agency, this is one
agency so I went down there.
That's how, I was in England.

00:12:30.442 --> 00:12:32.762
Interviewer: And then You start
[UNCLEAR]

00:12:32.762 --> 00:12:35.738
Shri Mataji: Yes, very difficult though
with English. Horrible nuts!

00:12:37.326 --> 00:12:41.166
Interviewer: Here they are very much
involved with You,

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:44.500
with Your philosophies, with Your
preachings, with Your ideals

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.319
Shri Mataji: Who, who are involved?

00:12:46.319 --> 00:12:48.673
Interviewer: Here, we see and there
are so many

00:12:48.673 --> 00:12:51.771
Shri Mataji: Unnh, I'm sorry what I'm
saying about English.

00:12:51.771 --> 00:12:54.384
Yes, yes, it's alright.
They don't mind, they know that.

00:12:54.571 --> 00:12:58.311
They are themselves facing them. You
see, everyday they are -

00:12:58.311 --> 00:13:04.663
they, poor things they have broken their
hands, you see, doing this raising of
the Kundalini;

00:13:04.663 --> 00:13:11.111
They themselves know, they don't mind
what I say. They are no more English,
now they are International.

00:13:11.111 --> 00:13:14.154
Sahaja yogi: They are human beings.
Shri Mataji: They are human beings.

00:13:14.462 --> 00:13:19.272
Interviewer: And is it important, Mataji,
to be vegetarian for practising
Sahaja Yoga?

00:13:19.272 --> 00:13:24.501
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no not at all.
Vegetarians are difficult also. They are
go to another extremes also.

00:13:24.501 --> 00:13:28.349
You must have balance, you must have
protein food in your body.

00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:30.441
Interviewer: As the Gita said, the
saatvik food

00:13:30.441 --> 00:13:34.230
Shri Mataji: Yes. No, the saatvik is, I don't
know what they mean by saatvik means

00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:39.916
the - what we say that the saatvik food
is the one that is vibrated, which
is vibrated,

00:13:39.916 --> 00:13:46.152
which is been given vibrations; That is
for us saatvik food is. Not this kind of
saatvik food,

00:13:46.152 --> 00:13:51.392
that if you eat only bhaaji palak, then
you are saatvik. No, they are never
saatvik.

00:13:51.392 --> 00:13:53.372
Interviewer: So what type of diet
should we eat?

00:13:53.372 --> 00:13:56.139
Shri Mataji: Whatever is the balance in
one. You see, some people -

00:13:56.139 --> 00:14:01.961
like in England I say, you should become
vegetarians and India I say, you better
become non-vegetarians

00:14:01.961 --> 00:14:07.249
specially Marwaris because their ladies
have such weak muscles, you know,

00:14:07.249 --> 00:14:13.200
they can't even walk after 50 years of
age, so it's very - and they get all
troubles of the muscles,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:20.323
they get the shaking of the muscles,
the heart becomes very weak,
they get anginas;

00:14:20.323 --> 00:14:25.967
all these troubles come because the
muscles are so weak, so they must take
protein diet - that's the main point.

00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:30.300
And the subtle point you can say they
must have more protein diet

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:35.226
Now they eat more of useless things
like ghee etc., that must be given up

00:14:37.229 --> 00:14:40.929
Interviewer: Can You Mother, tell me
something about Your early life?

00:14:40.929 --> 00:14:46.766
Shri Mataji: My life? Now what should I
tell you? I slept at 4 0'clock last night.

00:14:46.766 --> 00:14:49.100
Sahaja Yogini: Now everyone would
like to know something about that too.

00:14:49.598 --> 00:14:55.728
Shri Mataji: Now what should I tell you? I
Sahaja Yogini: But when did you started
to feel this

00:14:55.728 --> 00:15:04.180
Shri Mataji: Start - 70, 1970 I started.
Actually I was born like this, in a very
enlightened family, I should say.

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:14.213
My father was a very enlightened man
and he was Member of the Assembly,
Central Assembly.

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:19.957
He was the Member of the Constitution,
Constituent Assembly Parliament.

00:15:19.957 --> 00:15:28.479
My mother was a Honours of
Mathematics and My father was a
scholar of Bangla language also.

00:15:28.479 --> 00:15:32.328
Very much, from him I learnt Bangla.
Interviewer: What's his name?

00:15:32.328 --> 00:15:37.871
Shri Mataji: His name was Mr. P.K. Salve.
We have a road in his name, we have
got his statues.

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:44.370
Interviewer: Mr. P. L.?
Shri Mataji: P. K. Salve, S-A-L-V-E.

00:15:44.370 --> 00:15:54.797
Actually, we come from, originally from
Rajputana and My uh.., My...,

00:15:54.797 --> 00:16:01.841
I mean there's a dynasty, called
Shalivahana. We are from that dynasty
Shalivahana.

00:16:01.841 --> 00:16:04.399
You might have heard the name of
Shalivahana?

00:16:04.399 --> 00:16:06.710
Lady: Shalivahan?
Shri Mataji: Shalivahan

00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:08.804
Shalivahan Dynasty. They have
also a calendar.

00:16:08.804 --> 00:16:14.852
Now this dynasty ended up in
Ahmednagar, near Ahmednagar

00:16:14.852 --> 00:16:22.670
and then My father, mother shifted from
there to Indore and that's how we were,

00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:29.206
then they came down to Madhya
Pradesh and that's how I was born in
Chhindwara in Madhya Pradesh.

00:16:29.206 --> 00:16:36.270
Because that's the central point and is
the, is on the Tropic of Cancer.

00:16:36.347 --> 00:16:43.187
That's very few places are, Mecca is
also on Tropic of Cancer and this
Chhindwara is also on Tropic of Cancer.

00:16:43.187 --> 00:16:49.034
Cancer is the Mother, you see, that's
why I was to be born there in that place.

00:16:50.277 --> 00:16:56.887
Interviewer: From which age you started
practising Spiritual practises?

00:16:56.887 --> 00:17:01.594
Shri Mataji: No, I was born like this
only and I never practised anything

00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.360
because I was born like this,
so what is there to practise.

00:17:07.502 --> 00:17:11.942
Lady: When did You started to see
that You are

00:17:11.942 --> 00:17:14.378
Shri Mataji: From very childhood.
No, it's alright.

00:17:14.378 --> 00:17:22.074
From very childhood I was born like
that. I felt - as you know from your
childhood that you are a human-being,

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:27.853
I knew I was something else from My
very childhood. Very conscious of it,
very aware of it.

00:17:28.176 --> 00:17:30.306
Lady: And Your parents knew that
as well?

00:17:30.306 --> 00:17:33.365
Shri Mataji: Of course My father was
very much, even My Mother was.

00:17:33.365 --> 00:17:37.805
Interviewer: Is there any common
training centre of Sahaja Yoga
in Calcutta?

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:40.720
Shri Mataji: Problem - you better
ask these people.

00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:50.925
[Sahaja Yogi gives the addresses]

00:17:50.925 --> 00:17:55.821
Shri Mataji: Hello, please come.
Please give space here.

00:18:00.278 --> 00:18:03.614
Interviewer: Mataji who is your guru?
Shri Mataji: Unnh?

00:18:03.614 --> 00:18:07.852
Interviewer: Guru?
Shri Mataji: I have no guru. I'm Ma
- Ma doesn't have guru.

00:18:07.852 --> 00:18:12.694
Ma is the guru of the gurus.
How can She have guru?

00:18:14.906 --> 00:18:20.056
Interviewer: Mataji, can You give us
some, some meditation, easy
meditation techniques

00:18:20.067 --> 00:18:25.107
for our readers which they can practise
by reading this article?

00:18:26.344 --> 00:18:29.833
Shri Mataji: You see, you give My
photograph, alright? And

00:18:29.833 --> 00:18:31.500
Interviewer: We have taken
Your photographs.

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.942
Shri Mataji: Alright, so give My
photograph. Ask them to put both the
hands towards the photograph.

00:18:35.403 --> 00:18:39.373
They might, most of them feel the
cool breeze in the hands.

00:18:39.373 --> 00:18:41.714
Interviewer: They should put the
hands like this?
Shri Mataji: Like this,

00:18:41.714 --> 00:18:49.381
and say that, "Mother, are You the,
are You the Divine Mother?" that's all.

00:18:50.341 --> 00:18:54.421
and they get the cool breeze in their
hands, most of them. If they don't get it,

00:18:54.421 --> 00:19:00.596
they should try to write to these people
and they will tell them what is their
problem, with their photographs.

00:19:00.596 --> 00:19:04.493
Interviewer: With their photographs;
Photographs they will get from our
magazine. We will

00:19:04.493 --> 00:19:08.237
Shri Mataji: Yes, that's alright, but when
they want to find out what's wrong
with them,

00:19:08.237 --> 00:19:11.218
or if they are sick, supposing they
are sick

00:19:11.218 --> 00:19:14.956
they should send their photo,
their own photo to Mr. Jalaan.

00:19:14.956 --> 00:19:18.376
Interviewer: Achcha, his own photo.
Shri Mataji: Yes, their own photographs.

00:19:18.376 --> 00:19:21.123
Interviewer: And how long should
they practise this ...?

00:19:21.123 --> 00:19:25.262
Shri Mataji: No, not necessary, you see,
five minutes in the morning, five
minutes in the evening.

00:19:25.262 --> 00:19:29.504
Very simple it is. If they write to him,
he will tell them what is to be done.

00:19:29.504 --> 00:19:32.689
So not much to be spent because
you are in meditation all the time.

00:19:32.689 --> 00:19:38.839
you are in meditation, don't have to do
meditation. You just do little cleansing
like this, that's all.

00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:42.880
Interviewer: Thank You Mother
for everything
Shri Mataji: May God bless you!

00:19:43.562 --> 00:19:47.532
His - just come in front. Will
give you realization.

00:19:47.532 --> 00:19:49.965
Do you also do yoga?
Interviewer: Yes Mother.

00:19:49.965 --> 00:19:54.072
Shri Mataji: Haan, that's why is on the,
you see, you're catching on the
right heart, as we say.

00:19:54.072 --> 00:20:00.915
So, try to understand what is the use
of yoga because, like, if a car is moving

00:20:00.915 --> 00:20:06.775
annh, and then you know where is
obstruction, you know how to turn
your car, isn't it?

00:20:06.775 --> 00:20:11.807
But if you just, keeping the car here
standing, if you move the car,
what's the use?

00:20:11.849 --> 00:20:15.749
In the same way, when the Kundalini is
not moving, see,

00:20:15.749 --> 00:20:19.929
if you try to do something about it,
then you spoil your chakras.

00:20:19.929 --> 00:20:25.414
Like right now, you are having a problem
with your left heart, that's why you
are sweating,

00:20:25.414 --> 00:20:30.118
and that the left heart is very important
in Sahaja yog so we have to pay
attention

00:20:30.118 --> 00:20:36.792
actually to our Spirit, not to our body.
If we pay attention to our Spirit,
everything is looked after.

00:20:37.222 --> 00:20:43.090
You get rid of all your diseases. We have
cured all kinds of diseases like cancer,
this, that

00:20:43.090 --> 00:20:46.218
Interviewer: Even cancer?
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course,
of course

00:20:46.218 --> 00:20:52.437
And those who get realization, never
get cancer.
Interviewer: It is very good.

00:20:52.437 --> 00:20:57.808
Shri Mataji: That is your own power, I'm
doing nothing. You have got it. Just you
have to be awakened, that's all.

00:20:57.808 --> 00:21:03.473
then you can awaken others. Alright?
Interviewer: That's very good.

00:21:03.473 --> 00:21:06.420
Shri Mataji: May God bless you!

00:21:18.356 --> 00:21:20.136
What's your name?

00:21:20.136 --> 00:21:22.499
Interviewer: My name is Mukul Dutta
Shri Mataji: Mukul?

00:21:22.499 --> 00:21:25.166
Interviewer: Mukul Dutta
Shri Mataji: Dutt? Achcha

00:21:26.729 --> 00:21:32.199
Please call for some water. Okay,
now are you also, are you from
some newspaper?

00:21:32.199 --> 00:21:34.329
Lady: No, I'm not
Shri Mataji: Thank God!

00:21:34.329 --> 00:21:38.404
Lady: but I could be
Sahaja Yogi: She is a Sahaj Yogini
from Calcutta.

00:21:38.504 --> 00:21:42.404
Shri Mataji: Okay, okay, now what,
tell Me, what are your orders.

00:21:46.876 --> 00:21:52.726
Sahaja yogi(Doctor): Listen to
Mother and take the vibrations.
She'll be working on

00:21:54.659 --> 00:22:03.509
Sahaja yogi: Ganesha's statue
Shri Mataji: Ahh, it's very beautiful!

00:22:03.519 --> 00:22:07.689
Sahaja yogi: One hundred years
Shri Mataji: One hundred years old?

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.320
Are you okay now?
Sahaja Yogi : 200%

00:22:30.285 --> 00:22:34.615
Shri Mataji: I think you should not sit
next to him, you sit this side because
both of you

00:22:34.615 --> 00:22:37.757
No, no but you sit this side
- why I'm saying, reason is,

00:22:37.757 --> 00:22:41.190
this boy has been affected by the
same as you were affected with.

00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:45.092
So you should not share, isn't it,
otherwise he will also be in trouble.

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:50.040
Haan, sit anywhere you like. Now you
move out. Where is your wife?

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:54.286
Sahaj Yogi: She is .. just get up.
Shri Mataji: Okay, hello

00:23:01.199 --> 00:23:15.049
Well, now I thank you very much for
making this program so successful.

00:23:17.528 --> 00:23:30.318
And this has become a great hope
for Me. Now, the collective problems
that we have among our Sahaja Yogis

00:23:30.804 --> 00:23:40.134
I think that many people here have
quite weak eyesight. I kept watching
that many people's eyes are weak here.

00:23:40.134 --> 00:23:50.214
What should be done for that? So,
for that you people will have to
help each other.

00:23:50.256 --> 00:23:59.296
Keep a light in front of the photograph.
And after some age, the eyesight
becomes slightly weak

00:23:59.296 --> 00:24:05.840
but still to give it strength so that
it doesn't get damaged too much, a
light needs to be placed in front

00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:14.428
In front of the photo and with a
light in hand in any candle stand

00:24:15.034 --> 00:24:24.804
and on the back side here, on the
back Agnya, as you do the aarti
in the same way you do it.

00:24:24.804 --> 00:24:35.734
The one sitting in front will sit
with his right hand towards the
photo and his left hand like this

00:24:35.853 --> 00:24:43.473
and at the back, their aarti will
be performed like this and they ought to,

00:24:46.406 --> 00:24:56.766
that when the aarti is over, then sit
down and keep their hand in front of the
light and their right hand on the ground.

00:24:56.766 --> 00:25:08.920
But here you are given vibrated
water, add a little bit of
vibrated sugar to it

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:17.889
Mix it to dissolve it and put two
drops in the eyes using a spoon.

00:25:17.889 --> 00:25:27.964
If you want, mix it in rose water. Mix
that water and sugar in rose water and
put it on your eyes and keep them
closed for some time.

00:25:27.964 --> 00:25:36.380
When the water drains out, it's fine.
And you can also use honey,
instead of sugar.

00:25:36.409 --> 00:25:44.149
Sugar- If they give Me this honey now,
I will vibrate it. Apply honey to
your eyes.

00:25:44.149 --> 00:25:52.867
And if you add some rose water to
water and put it in your eyes,
it will wash your eyes.

00:25:52.867 --> 00:25:59.732
Apply honey and leave for a while, your
eyes will start watering, then you
should wash your eyes with a mixture
of rose water and water.

00:26:00.129 --> 00:26:06.369
Your eyesight will improve,
but if your age is more

00:26:06.369 --> 00:26:14.949
and if after fifty years, it just happens
that the eye will remain as it is and will
not become weaker, at least that much is achieved.

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:25.440
And this weakness comes from eating fish.
A lot of fish is eaten, it contains phosphorus.

00:26:25.538 --> 00:26:35.878
By eating phosphorus, that phosphorus
gets burned here and because of
this, this problem is caused

00:26:36.154 --> 00:26:42.714
of the eyes, so eat little less fish.
It's difficult for Bengali people.

00:26:42.714 --> 00:26:45.603
Seeker: Mataji should we do this
Sahaja Yoga at night before sleeping?

00:26:45.603 --> 00:26:51.146
Shri Mataji: Yes, do it anytime - do it
in the morning, do it before going to sleep.
It's good if you do it twice in the beginning.

00:26:51.146 --> 00:26:57.392
And those who have good eyes should
also do this, then their eyes
will not get damaged soon.

00:26:59.116 --> 00:27:06.926
Secondly, I see a lot of people
here having a catch on the Hamsa Chakra.

00:27:06.926 --> 00:27:18.185
For the catch on Hamsa Chakra, take a
little ghee every day, make good ghee
and keep it in a dropper bottle.

00:27:18.185 --> 00:27:26.414
And should definitely put two drops in
the nose. This will keep the Hamsa Chakra
clean; all dryness will go away.

00:27:26.676 --> 00:27:34.836
This is especially beneficial for
those who are very dry. It will open
up your Hamsa and you will feel good.

00:27:35.367 --> 00:27:40.027
Thirdly, I see that people cough
a lot; They keep coughing all the time.

00:27:40.027 --> 00:27:45.497
Then also because of the dust,
because of the dust here
- the dust here causes allergies.

00:27:45.575 --> 00:27:56.085
For that it is necessary that you take
the name of Shri Krishna and put some
butter in your hand on this finger,

00:27:56.085 --> 00:28:02.664
take a little butter on your thumb
and salt and take it inside your mouth,

00:28:02.664 --> 00:28:07.311
there is a small tongue there,
touch it and press it with that(thumb).

00:28:07.311 --> 00:28:11.751
This should be done three times,
the coughing will stop.

00:28:11.751 --> 00:28:18.077
And there is a thing here which is
called Peepli, Lendi Peepli, I don't
know, you must be knowing, it's small-small,

00:28:18.077 --> 00:28:23.064
Keep it in your mouth until you are
coughing and then should be thrown away.

00:28:23.064 --> 00:28:28.938
Just to be put in your mouth and
then thrown away; not to be
eaten because it is very bitter.

00:28:31.443 --> 00:28:36.003
Sahaja Yogis: We could not follow You
Mother - name of the root.

00:28:36.003 --> 00:28:43.218
Shri Mataji: Lendi Peepli. Lendi
Peepli, which is small. The thin
one, not the thick one.

00:28:43.218 --> 00:28:46.428
Seeker: We call it clove.
Shri Mataji: It is bigger than a clove.

00:28:48.531 --> 00:28:55.641
Hey, bring it and show it. We have
Lendi Peepli here. Okay, fine.

00:28:55.641 --> 00:28:59.747
Look, everything is being taped,
you people please read it again.

00:28:59.747 --> 00:29:04.437
Because now it's like this, don't ask
questions right now, whatever I
am saying is being taped.

00:29:04.437 --> 00:29:10.124
You will listen to it again, you
all bring paper and pencil and
write down everything on it.

00:29:10.443 --> 00:29:15.743
Now we don't use oil.
Nowadays a new fashion has emerged

00:29:15.743 --> 00:29:19.955
not to apply oil to your hair,
everyone will become bald-headed
very soon.

00:29:19.955 --> 00:29:26.931
Don't do any new fashion - everything
old is good. You should rub oil
on your head properly.

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:35.500
Oil should be rubbed on the Sahastrar.
Here you have such a good oil of
Jabakusum. That Jabakusum oil - see this -

00:29:46.183 --> 00:29:56.153
You take one bottle of Jabakusum
hair oil, and two bottles of the
same Jabakusum

00:29:56.153 --> 00:30:00.987
coconut oil, mix it and apply it
on your head every Saturday.

00:30:00.987 --> 00:30:05.210
Apply it thoroughly on the head
at night, one bowl at a time.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:10.176
If men folk do not like the smell of
Jabakusum, they can take three bottles.

00:30:10.176 --> 00:30:14.464
But take pure coconut oil,
pure coconut oil.

00:30:14.464 --> 00:30:20.104
And apply it on your head very well
and go to sleep at night, wash it
off thoroughly on Sunday;

00:30:20.104 --> 00:30:25.974
But at least a bowl full should be
applied. Everyone should put oil.

00:30:25.974 --> 00:30:30.961
Oil should be put in the ears every
Saturday, before taking a bath.

00:30:30.961 --> 00:30:36.619
It is good to put oil in the ears
anyway. If you put one drop
everyday, nothing bad will happen.

00:30:36.619 --> 00:30:40.831
But you should apply oil to your
body also.

00:30:40.831 --> 00:30:45.775
So, don't know which oil people use -
applying mustard oil burns the colour.

00:30:45.775 --> 00:30:52.144
So it is better if you apply a little
bit of ghee, and then take a bath,
applying butter is also good.

00:30:52.496 --> 00:31:01.326
But don't apply butter on your head.
Or, if you want, you can apply
coconut oil, okay.

00:31:01.326 --> 00:31:08.330
It cools, the coconut cools it down,
that's why wherever the country
is hot, God gives coconut there.

00:31:08.330 --> 00:31:17.815
The kernel, which you call coconut,
is Shri phal, the fruit of the Goddess,
and it is formed just like your brain.

00:31:17.851 --> 00:31:27.271
So whoever is suffering from heat or has
excessive heat in the body, it will be
beneficial if they bathe with this oil.

00:31:27.271 --> 00:31:35.510
Other oils like amla etc also
cool the head. Here Golden Amla
is a very good oil.

00:31:35.510 --> 00:31:41.626
One who has a buzzing sensation in
the head or one whose head feels
hot and dry, by taking medicines,

00:31:41.626 --> 00:31:47.330
using Golden Amla Hair Oil from Bengal
Chemicals is very good for that person.

00:31:47.330 --> 00:31:55.715
And for ladies, you know Multani
Mitti, wash your face with Multani
Mitti(Mud), and nothing else.

00:31:55.715 --> 00:32:02.933
Keep Multani mitti in a bottle of
cream and add water to it and wash
your face with it whenever you want.

00:32:02.933 --> 00:32:07.857
Then there will be no problem with
your skin. Multani mitti(A type of mud)
is a very sacred thing.

00:32:08.102 --> 00:32:14.542
This is for you people so that
your skin stays good

00:32:14.542 --> 00:32:23.895
and your face remains beautiful
and there is no problem in it.

00:32:24.581 --> 00:32:31.361
Within the body, here I see many
people have a problem of
amoebic dysentery.

00:32:31.361 --> 00:32:37.101
And many people are suffering with
the problem of amoebic dysentery -
I have seen this disease common here -

00:32:37.101 --> 00:32:44.721
gas, there is a lot of gas etc. So
for that you should eat such food -
like people eat a lot of rice here.

00:32:44.721 --> 00:32:51.115
There is no harm in eating rice
but remove the starch from it.

00:32:51.115 --> 00:32:57.421
And even if the starch is removed,
then to the husk, husk that is
the covering of rice,

00:32:57.421 --> 00:33:02.420
should be roasted a bit and
mixed before eating.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:08.486
What happens then is that it contains
diastase, and because of that the
rice will be digested.

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:14.930
If starch is removed from the rice, it
is good. Removed the starch. You removed
the starch by adding water to the rice.

00:33:14.930 --> 00:33:18.341
But that starchy water is not to be
consumed. You can use it for
your sarees etc.

00:33:18.341 --> 00:33:25.985
And if you mix this rice with the
husk and eat it, then it contains
diastase.

00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:33.212
So one you removed the starch
present in it, so the starch is reduced,

00:33:33.212 --> 00:33:36.883
and on top of that you also ate
diastase, so it got digested.

00:33:36.883 --> 00:33:42.161
But roti(Flattened bread) is better
than rice, if you like it;
sometimes roti should also be eaten.

00:33:42.161 --> 00:33:50.157
Eating roti will be beneficial.
With it, so much soft food people
here eat, everything soft.

00:33:50.157 --> 00:33:57.741
Like when a vegetable is cooked,
there will be a lot of liquid
in it; everything is soupy.

00:33:57.741 --> 00:34:04.501
So that soup that is, should be
reduced a little. Because taking too
much of soup affects the intestines,

00:34:04.501 --> 00:34:08.280
they become weak. Because of this
there is constipation.

00:34:08.668 --> 00:34:15.338
Because we don't eat anything else,
like salad etc., so this is better

00:34:15.338 --> 00:34:21.687
that we should eat at least such
things which create some roughage
otherwise we get constipation.

00:34:21.687 --> 00:34:27.817
If there is constipation, then gases
start. If gases start, then all
kinds of problems occur.

00:34:27.817 --> 00:34:35.831
And the best medicine I've seen
for gases is Gasex; that is made
by this Himalaya Drug Company.

00:34:35.831 --> 00:34:39.862
If you take two tablets of that,
then it also absorbs gases.

00:34:39.862 --> 00:34:43.257
By the way charcoal tablets are also
available, they are also beneficial.

00:34:43.257 --> 00:34:47.570
But it's better not to do
anything such which causes gas.

00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:55.105
Gases are produced by things that
are found underground, that are
inside the ground.

00:34:55.105 --> 00:35:05.913
Like there is radish, carrot, potato,
and colocasia, and sweet potato.

00:35:05.913 --> 00:35:10.682
Eating those things which are in
the roots causes gases.

00:35:10.682 --> 00:35:16.241
If you stop eating them, you will
get some relief; and after having
dinner in the evening if you slowly

00:35:16.241 --> 00:35:26.800
walk a hundred, hundred, a hundred
yards is enough – even a hundred feet
if you can walk, it is very useful.

00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:30.640
Thus this is the biggest complaint about
gases I have seen among people here.

00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:35.927
And you get loose stomach if you
keep eating only vegetarian food.

00:35:35.927 --> 00:35:41.901
So eat vegetarian because people
can't eat it but it is important
that you eat protein food

00:35:41.901 --> 00:35:47.617
which will eliminate the looseness and
sagging of the body. Protein must be
consumed as it helps in building muscles.

00:35:48.590 --> 00:35:56.259
Another good way to build muscles is
that in the sea - there is no sea here -

00:35:56.259 --> 00:36:09.175
but by grinding the grass that grows
in the sea and adding any butter
or cream to it,

00:36:09.175 --> 00:36:14.738
mixing any of these to it, if it
is rubbed on the body, then
is also beneficial.

00:36:14.738 --> 00:36:20.111
Because it also contains phosphorus
and it is very beneficial for our body.

00:36:20.111 --> 00:36:24.196
If you are overweight then try this,
it will be of great benefit.

00:36:24.196 --> 00:36:30.653
That in it and you can use any such
ghee like Dalda(hydrogenated oil)
or something like that

00:36:30.653 --> 00:36:40.537
in which, which is like vegetable
oil, mix it and massage your
body with it

00:36:40.537 --> 00:36:44.871
Then your body will become very tight.
There is a lot/much more in natural things.

00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:51.420
Now the other thing I see here is that
people have a lot of complaints about
bile, they have a great deal of bile.
They always feel like yawning.

00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:57.978
For those people who have excess
bile,  for them it is required
that there is a fruit kokam.

00:36:57.978 --> 00:37:04.966
Make its juice and add salt and
sugar to it and drink it. Such
people should eat a lot of sugar.

00:37:04.966 --> 00:37:10.588
And for such people I will vibrate
the sugar here, so you people eat
that sugar

00:37:10.588 --> 00:37:16.904
It will be beneficial, the vomiting
like sensation that comes/occurs,
burning here, there is heart burning

00:37:16.904 --> 00:37:21.360
so such people should not eat fried
food and should reduce the intake
of dairy products.

00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:26.460
In this way you can also cure
the problem of your bile.

00:37:26.460 --> 00:37:29.103
The one who has excess bile
can also cure it.

00:37:29.103 --> 00:37:34.431
And in the winter season when it
is very cold, you can eat
dry ginger and sugar.

00:37:34.431 --> 00:37:39.280
Anyways, sugarcane juice is very
beneficial for such people.
Sugarcane juice should be taken.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:46.403
With sugarcane juice, your liver
will remain healthy and you will
feel refreshed.

00:37:46.403 --> 00:37:51.542
Because when the liver is bad, a
person becomes irritable, becomes
angry - doesn't like anything.

00:37:51.542 --> 00:37:55.238
Liver is - they say, liver is very
important for life.

00:37:56.406 --> 00:38:01.336
These two diseases I have seen a
lot and I have talked about them.

00:38:01.336 --> 00:38:09.477
If you want to ask about any
other disease, please ask.
Seeker: Asthma.

00:38:09.477 --> 00:38:12.957
Shri Mataji: Asthma – Asthma
is caused by the liver.

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:19.759
Anyways if you always keep ice on your
liver, your liver will become cold.

00:38:19.759 --> 00:38:25.820
To cure asthma, always keep a
little ice on your liver.

00:38:25.820 --> 00:38:34.445
And with the ice, you can also put
some ice on the right side of your
back, right heart area.

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:39.222
Should not eat. When we eat ice,
it creates heat, but it should
be applied from outside

00:38:39.222 --> 00:38:44.411
so it draws out the heat; it will
cure your asthma and its mantra is,

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:50.940
of Shri Ram. By chanting the mantra
of Shri Ram, it can be cured.

00:38:52.770 --> 00:38:58.680
Those who think too much of the future,
think that they have to go now,
so now keep a car,

00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:01.332
then do this, then do that,
so this is what is to be done.

00:39:01.332 --> 00:39:05.650
Women especially always think about
what to cook tomorrow, what to
cook the day after,

00:39:05.650 --> 00:39:11.431
then what should I bring, what should I bring;
thinking about all this is useless. Whichever
vegetable you get in the market you will
eat that only.

00:39:13.136 --> 00:39:19.166
It's a strange thing that if we
have decided that today we will
eat Parmal(A Vegetable)

00:39:19.166 --> 00:39:21.722
and there is no parmal in the market,
so what will we eat parmal?

00:39:23.365 --> 00:39:29.155
Women think a lot of things like
this all the time - useless things,
so this should be stopped.

00:39:29.155 --> 00:39:33.920
And the second thing is that the kitchen
should be like this, the house should
be like this, this should be like this.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:39.287
Then if the husband moves his foot from
here to here, will say, 'Hey, don't do
it like that, look it's getting spoilt.'

00:39:39.940 --> 00:39:46.980
Men folk come to the house, children
come, that a beautiful nest has
been made in the house,

00:39:46.980 --> 00:39:51.131
will come here and rest. If it gets a
little spoilt, it can be fixed,
what's the matter with that?

00:39:51.131 --> 00:39:54.536
Always be after their life,
'Sit properly, keep that.'

00:39:54.536 --> 00:39:59.833
If a thing breaks, it's done, there's a
lot of chaos in the house. Few things
in the house will definitely break.

00:39:59.833 --> 00:40:02.283
If they don't break in the house
then where else will they break?

00:40:02.283 --> 00:40:08.664
So those women who show insistence
on everything, their body dries up.

00:40:08.664 --> 00:40:12.470
Then they start having all these complaints.
So one must remain totally relaxed.

00:40:12.470 --> 00:40:16.487
There is no harm. If the house is spoilt
a little, you fix it. What's in it?

00:40:16.487 --> 00:40:20.456
But they think that it will be
hard work for them. So they
start shouting beforehand.

00:40:20.456 --> 00:40:23.601
But shouting takes more effort
in comparison to fixing it.

00:40:25.712 --> 00:40:29.452
And also to men who always find
faults with their women.

00:40:29.452 --> 00:40:32.932
The women folk take a little more
time to get ready, naturally.

00:40:32.932 --> 00:40:38.332
Because what's it for the men, they have
adopted good dresses of the English,
quickly put them on and are ready to go.

00:40:38.654 --> 00:40:43.634
Now women have to wear the sari
properly; Now for Me only, it
takes Me very less time.

00:40:43.634 --> 00:40:49.438
However, now the sari, if it's high or
low then to they'll say, 'You're
wearing the sari high or low.'

00:40:49.438 --> 00:40:52.762
Then, 'Why did you wear this saree?'
Then so and so. What have you got to do?

00:40:53.515 --> 00:40:58.545
Keep finding every fault in women,
like, 'Why did you sit like this,
then why did you say that,'

00:40:58.545 --> 00:41:03.083
'Then why did you go there, so why didn't
you come here, then why didn't you do like
this,' you spoil your head with that too.

00:41:03.083 --> 00:41:06.348
There is no need for this. You look
at yourself, let her look at herself.

00:41:06.348 --> 00:41:10.016
In Sahaja Yoga there is no need
for anyone to correct anyone else.

00:41:10.016 --> 00:41:14.692
And those people who start correcting,
then there is no end for them.

00:41:14.692 --> 00:41:17.459
They feel they have the right
to correct a woman.

00:41:17.459 --> 00:41:21.230
He corrects her in everything and
then the woman keeps correcting him.
It goes on like this.

00:41:21.230 --> 00:41:26.960
There is no question of conflict in
Sahaja Yoga. There are two wheels
in Sahaja Yoga, one left and one right.

00:41:27.156 --> 00:41:31.316
The left wheel cannot come to
the right, the right wheel
cannot come to the left.

00:41:31.316 --> 00:41:35.750
The left should stay on the left,
the right on the right.
Both are equal but not similar.

00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:39.215
So a woman shouldn't force anything,
nor should a man.

00:41:39.215 --> 00:41:44.984
Should live with one another with
understanding. Wherever a woman is,
she is fine in her place and wherever
a man is, he is fine in his place.

00:41:44.984 --> 00:41:49.200
Now if you put the nose in place
of the eye and the eye in place
of the nose, both will be useless.

00:41:51.497 --> 00:41:55.907
Seeker: Joint pain
Shri Mataji: Yes?
Seeker: There is pain in the joint.

00:41:55.907 --> 00:42:00.466
Shri Mataji: The pain in the joints
come from the navel chakra.
The nabhi should be corrected.

00:42:00.466 --> 00:42:05.099
And secondly, in this you should not
eat anything grown under the ground.

00:42:05.099 --> 00:42:10.611
And I will vibrate kerosene oil
and give it to you, mix it
with any oil and apply it.

00:42:10.729 --> 00:42:14.749
And you should always keep on doing
some exercise. Won't happen with that.

00:42:14.749 --> 00:42:18.649
And thirdly, bathing with hot
water creates many problems.

00:42:18.649 --> 00:42:22.316
Should take bath with cold water.
Should bathe with running cold water.

00:42:22.316 --> 00:42:26.357
Should not take bath with hot water.
Bathing with hot water causes
many problems.

00:42:26.357 --> 00:42:32.329
Muscular pains occur. In the muscles
- what do you people call it,
atropy or something else

00:42:32.329 --> 00:42:35.133
Sahaja Yogi: Atrophy, when the
muscles become weak.

00:42:35.133 --> 00:42:37.166
Shri Mataji: Yes, atropy happens.
Sahaja Yogi: Atrophy

00:42:37.166 --> 00:42:42.996
Shri Mataji: Atrophy occurs. They
become weak and stiff, cannot walk,

00:42:43.079 --> 00:42:47.809
that's why should not bathe with hot
water, should bathe with cold water.

00:42:47.809 --> 00:42:52.527
Women have more habit of bathing than
men, so they have more problems
of the legs.

00:42:52.527 --> 00:42:55.638
Lady: Even in winter?
Shri Mataji: What?
Lady: Even in winter?

00:42:55.638 --> 00:43:00.490
Shri Mataji: Yes. Once you get used to
it, then even in winters, there is no
problem. You can bathe with cold water.

00:43:00.490 --> 00:43:02.080
Lady: I get a lot of pain in my throat.
Shri Mataji: What?

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:06.394
Lady: I get a lot of pain in my throat.
Shri Mataji: Otherwise, I have already
told you the treatment for the throat.

00:43:06.623 --> 00:43:12.943
Your throat is also treated with the
same, hot water. The hot and cold
water causes discomfort.

00:43:13.713 --> 00:43:18.693
Mostly you should develop the habit
of cold water. Especially, start
this habit with the young children.

00:43:18.776 --> 00:43:21.566
Now if your habits are spoilt then
gradually reduce them.

00:43:21.566 --> 00:43:27.970
First bathe with hot, then cold.
But bring your body to cold
as much as possible.

00:43:27.970 --> 00:43:32.037
It's not very cold here.
I take cold bath even in London.

00:43:32.037 --> 00:43:39.598
Seeker: Arthritis
Shri Mataji: I've told about arthritis.
For the joints, for arthritis.

00:43:39.686 --> 00:43:47.056
And the other thing is if you can
drink lemon water. Boil hot water
and if you put lemon in it

00:43:47.426 --> 00:43:57.356
So two lemons in it - you take six
lemons for six days. Boiled water,
remember boiled water.

00:43:57.356 --> 00:44:03.952
If you put lemon in boiled water and
keep it, then take it after breakfast.

00:44:03.952 --> 00:44:06.732
Seeker: Should I put the whole lemon?
Shri Mataji: No, no, squeeze two lemons,

00:44:06.732 --> 00:44:10.666
squeeze it and have it after breakfast

00:44:10.666 --> 00:44:13.799
Then take it after lunch and then
again after dinner.

00:44:13.799 --> 00:44:18.213
Prepare it and keep it aside while
having breakfast, so it will cool
down and then you can drink it.

00:44:18.315 --> 00:44:25.305
And if you find it very sour, then
add honey to it and drink it.
With it this thing will be removed.

00:44:25.654 --> 00:44:32.614
It happens with vitamin C and the
other is ocher. Ocher should also be
applied. Ocher is beneficial, ocher.

00:44:32.614 --> 00:44:39.032
But the best is the oil I told you
about, kerosene oil, kerosene oil.

00:44:40.368 --> 00:44:42.618
Seeker: Which side should the head be
placed while sleeping?

00:44:43.524 --> 00:44:48.504
Shri Mataji: However you feel like
keep it that side, but should
not be towards the light.

00:44:48.777 --> 00:44:54.687
If you face the light at the time of
sleeping, the Agyna Chakra will keep
working - you will not get proper sleep.

00:44:54.687 --> 00:44:59.161
You should make it dark then sleep.
You should not keep the lights on
when you want to sleep.

00:44:59.161 --> 00:45:04.620
And keep your face on the side
where the light is not falling.
This is the most important thing.

00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:10.035
The thing is this, if there is My photograph,
should not sleep with feet towards it,
otherwise Hanumanji will trouble.

00:45:12.639 --> 00:45:15.289
Sahaja Yogi: Those who have
had heart attacks?

00:45:16.106 --> 00:45:18.716
Shri Mataji: There are two types of
heart attacks.

00:45:18.716 --> 00:45:24.510
One comes because of the lethargic
heart and another comes because of
the overactivity.

00:45:24.510 --> 00:45:30.085
Now depends on. If it is a overactive
heart, then you have to put your
right hand on the thing

00:45:30.085 --> 00:45:33.897
and your left hand towards the
photograph and you have to say,

00:45:33.897 --> 00:45:38.665
"Mother. I am the Spirit."
You understand, right - will be done.

00:45:38.665 --> 00:45:43.405
If it is a lethargic heart, then you have
to put right to the left, like this.

00:45:43.405 --> 00:45:49.249
Lethargic heart - right to the left, like
this, then it works out and you should
say, "Mother, I'm not guilty."

00:45:49.249 --> 00:45:54.185
Because it is only due to the Vishuddhi
Chakra getting affected that problems
like lethargic heart and angina arise.

00:45:54.880 --> 00:45:58.160
Seeker: When my wife came You said that
Shri Mataji: Huh?

00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:07.450
Seeker: My wife came yesterday (UNCLEAR)

00:46:07.450 --> 00:46:09.961
You told her on the day of Puja

00:46:10.172 --> 00:46:18.032
Shri Mataji Yes, she came and sat here,
she should have meditated here, so she
just sat there, just like that.
She should have done something.

00:46:18.032 --> 00:46:21.702
When she came here, I am sitting here,
right? It is not necessary that
she has to meet Me.

00:46:21.702 --> 00:46:24.972
She was sitting to meet Me.
Seeker: No, she was just sitting like that.

00:46:24.972 --> 00:46:27.366
Shri Mataji: Yes. Did sitting here
make any difference to her?

00:46:27.366 --> 00:46:32.573
Seeker: She sat down that long here for
five hours, she sat down (UNCLEAR)

00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:36.950
Shri Mataji: Just this is all right.
Will happen like this. That's why
I said that you should come.

00:46:36.950 --> 00:46:41.705
I didn't say I would meet you,
isn't it? If she is sitting here,
I am sitting inside.

00:46:41.705 --> 00:46:46.138
It's a very good thing. Otherwise I
am everywhere.
Seeker: No, what else is to be done?

00:46:46.138 --> 00:46:49.816
Shri Mataji: What about, is she also
a vegetarian?
Seeker: She is also a vegetarian.

00:46:49.816 --> 00:46:53.289
Shri Mataji: That's the difficulty.
Well, do like this you give her protein.

00:46:53.289 --> 00:46:57.761
And give her the same oil, kerosene oil,
massage will be done with it.

00:46:57.761 --> 00:47:04.005
Lady: Meaning to say Mataji, she has a lot
of trouble while urinating etc.
What should be done for that?

00:47:04.005 --> 00:47:14.111
Seeker: Has to go repeatedly at night,
every hour.
Lady: Blood pressure also rises.
In the head a lot of (UNCLEAR)

00:47:14.111 --> 00:47:22.754
Shri Mataji: What? Has blood pressure?
Its treatment is very simple. You take
mud - do you know how to apply mud bandages?

00:47:22.754 --> 00:47:29.302
Mud, it will be completely cured.
It will be cured with a mud bandage.

00:47:32.039 --> 00:47:44.409
Seeker: For the fainting sickness Shri
Mataji? Mataji, fainting, fainting,
children faint, epileptic fainting.

00:47:44.409 --> 00:47:50.031
Shri Mataji: Yes, for fainting, left
hand towards the photo, right hand
on the ground. That will fix it.

00:47:52.613 --> 00:48:01.823
Seeker: Mataji, his only one hand works,
then how will he, all these postures
are done, hand towards the photo (UNCLEAR)

00:48:01.823 --> 00:48:07.695
Shri Mataji: Did this happen in childhood?
Seeker: No, he had polio just one and
a quarter year ago.

00:48:07.818 --> 00:48:12.258
Shri Mataji: Has polio. Polio can also
be cured, I have seen it.

00:48:12.258 --> 00:48:16.345
Seeker: In front of You, in front of Your
photograph he sits in meditation daily.
Shri Mataji: Hmm

00:48:16.345 --> 00:48:18.629
Seeker: But that he has to do
with just one hand.

00:48:18.629 --> 00:48:22.344
Shri Mataji: You people take this oil. That
which is - I will give you the oil just now

00:48:22.344 --> 00:48:31.268
Massaging with it enough - see whether
the hand can bend slightly just now,
try - no, no, just like this sitting
there - do the hand like this

00:48:31.421 --> 00:48:39.311
It's done, just now it's done, not
that one. Which? Right hand?
Lady: The right is impaired.

00:48:40.299 --> 00:48:42.769
Lady: He had Sameeba one day
Shri Mataji: What?

00:48:42.769 --> 00:48:45.965
Lady: Sameeba, I took from You,
You gave it earlier to me

00:48:45.965 --> 00:48:48.434
Shri Mataji: Did it not make any difference?
Lady: Not yet

00:48:48.434 --> 00:48:54.745
Shri Mataji: No, there is a difference
– don’t you feel any difference?

00:49:02.052 --> 00:49:06.182
Actually, in polio some diseases
are cured while some are not.

00:49:06.182 --> 00:49:09.678
But it should happen, it will get
better gradually. These hit hard.

00:49:09.678 --> 00:49:14.908
In this place, this place that is,
give him vibrations on the Vishuddhi,
from the photo on Vishuddhi,

00:49:14.908 --> 00:49:19.866
yes, here, on this right side,
right side - that might fix it.

00:49:24.806 --> 00:49:27.856
Seeker: Mataji, he just extends his
hand towards Your photo

00:49:27.856 --> 00:49:33.692
Shri Mataji: Yes, that is all right, that
is all right. But please give vibrations
here, at the Vishuddhi.

00:49:33.692 --> 00:49:38.902
Place your right hand on the Vishuddhi
and your left hand towards the photograph

00:49:38.902 --> 00:49:42.522
Keep a light there and it will work out.
It's okay even if you don't keep a
light there.

00:49:45.174 --> 00:49:52.524
You people place your hand - just
see the right Vishuddhi. Rustom
just put your hand on right Vishuddhi.

00:49:52.658 --> 00:49:56.898
And you also keep it, right hand,
keep right hand.

00:50:04.639 --> 00:50:07.971
Sahaja yogis should help (other)
Sahaja yogis.

00:50:13.457 --> 00:50:18.687
And one more thing, those who want
to come to Ganpatipule now,
should inform quickly.

00:50:18.826 --> 00:50:25.296
Those who wish to stay in the tents
should inform in that manner,
and those who wish to stay in those

00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:32.950
[Which house is that, what is it called?]
Cottages, if you want to live in those,
should give it(names) to them.

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:38.582
You will have to pay the charges for
them and for those who will stay
in the tents, it is free.

00:50:38.582 --> 00:50:44.984
I think tents etc. - we have paid
for them, the tents - don't know,
whatever it is.

00:50:44.984 --> 00:50:48.354
[MARATHI]

00:50:48.926 --> 00:50:54.026
There's a certain charge for all the
people, will have to pay that much.

00:50:54.696 --> 00:51:04.126
And those who want to stay there, in
addition to this charge, will have to
pay whatever other charges there are;
they will tell you.

00:51:04.126 --> 00:51:07.533
And those who want to get married
should also inform them.

00:51:07.533 --> 00:51:13.671
And photo etc will be coming to you soon;
we are preparing the forms for it.

00:51:13.989 --> 00:51:20.589
[MARATHI]

00:51:20.589 --> 00:51:27.161
[MARATHI] is like that
realization is a [MARATHI]

00:51:27.161 --> 00:51:33.893
[MARATHI]

00:51:33.933 --> 00:51:38.023
Lady: Mataji, left kidney operation
has been done -  left side kidney
has been taken out

00:51:38.023 --> 00:51:43.381
Shri Mataji: What?
Lady: Left kidney was removed after
operation,  has only the right kidney

00:51:43.479 --> 00:51:46.959
Shri Mataji: Doesn't matter.
Now you won't have any problem.

00:51:46.959 --> 00:51:50.021
Woman: No, I don't have it.
Shri Mataji: No, he too won't have too.

00:51:50.021 --> 00:51:53.380
There is no harm. Even if it wasn't
removed, we would have fixed it.

00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:58.856
Now that it has been removed, can't
be fixed again, but still, he will
not have any problem now.

00:51:58.856 --> 00:52:01.866
He'll be alright. But should
keep on having vibrated water.

00:52:05.989 --> 00:52:09.229
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, can the water be
vibrated infront of Your photograph?

00:52:09.229 --> 00:52:12.063
Shri Mataji: Annh?
Sahaja Yogi(Doctor): Infront of Your
photograph?

00:52:12.063 --> 00:52:17.423
Shri Mataji: Try it. I don't know,
try it. Of course, can be, why not?

00:52:17.423 --> 00:52:24.110
Keep both your hands on your knees like
this, will be done just now? Or keep your
right hand on the ground. Yes, that's it.

00:52:24.208 --> 00:52:28.088
I am sitting here right now so
why waste - take it. Yes!

00:52:28.172 --> 00:52:31.612
Seeker: Mataji, what should be done
for filariasis?
Shri Mataji: What?
Seeker: For filariasis?

00:52:31.612 --> 00:52:37.046
Shri Mataji: Malaria?
Seeker: Elephant foot.

00:52:38.219 --> 00:52:48.139
Shri Mataji: It's difficult. Normally
after Sahaja Yoga, in My opinion,
filariasis cannot happen.

00:52:48.139 --> 00:52:54.620
But if filariasis has already happened,
then for that, do water treatment

00:52:55.122 --> 00:52:59.112
or treat it with ice, with ice,
then may be

00:52:59.112 --> 00:53:04.734
it might work out but I can't say
exactly how will it be affected now

00:53:04.734 --> 00:53:08.791
but with ice treatment it might go
away. Just keep on applying ice.

00:53:10.215 --> 00:53:14.235
Keep your eyes open, son; I am
sitting here, so eyes should
not be closed.

00:53:16.709 --> 00:53:26.469
Is it working? Give a lemon in his
hand. Anything else?

00:53:28.180 --> 00:53:38.020
Need water, warm. It's cold, because
only that quenches the thirst.
What is this?

00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.460
Sahaja Yogi: You have not taken it
since morning.
Shri Mataji: Okay, give it, give it.

00:53:42.015 --> 00:53:50.765
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION BETWEEN
SHRI MATAJI AND SAHAJA YOGI]

00:53:51.390 --> 00:53:54.039
That's enough. Now everything is fine.

00:53:54.039 --> 00:54:01.539
How is the condition? Now look, move
your legs forward. Is it moving?
Is it better than before?

00:54:03.024 --> 00:54:10.494
Hmm, keep this. You people should do
it. Should give vibrations.

00:54:11.505 --> 00:54:16.555
Actually, if this illness remains after
Sahaja Yoga, then we should understand
that we have not given vibrations.

00:54:17.022 --> 00:54:24.212
One should put both knees on the ground
and lift one's legs from behind and say
to Mother, "Take all this of yours."

00:54:26.033 --> 00:54:35.043
Both hands on the ground, both knees
on the ground, and in front of the
photo one should say, "Mother,
please take this trouble of mine."

00:54:37.920 --> 00:54:44.280
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji has given you
all this time. One more group of
Lions' members is about to arrive.

00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:50.146
Therefore I request you all to take
your permission at the feet of Mother now

00:54:50.146 --> 00:54:56.077
Shri Mataji: Better? You have some
strength, see? Give a lemon in his hand.

00:55:00.659 --> 00:55:08.139
Is he better? You should do this
yourself - give vibrations.

00:55:09.070 --> 00:55:13.930
Lady: Mataji, whenever I sit in
meditation, sometimes more vibrations
come and sometimes less.

00:55:13.930 --> 00:55:20.946
When they are less then I wonder why
this has happened, why didn't they
come in meditation, not coming
strongly, what has happened.

00:55:21.577 --> 00:55:26.877
Shri Mataji: Your right Vishuddhi catches
a little bit - you stay in silence
for a few days, stay in silence.

00:55:26.877 --> 00:55:30.588
Should keep a betel nut in your mouth.
Will be alright if you remain in silence.

00:55:30.588 --> 00:55:35.407
Your Vishuddhi, right Vishuddhi
catches a little. Some rest here,
should give rest here.

00:55:35.407 --> 00:55:42.636
So a betel nut, listen na, at least
listen. Have a betel nut vibrated
and put it in mouth.

00:55:42.636 --> 00:55:48.767
And then not to talk much. Take some
rest. And you apply that, butter.

00:55:48.859 --> 00:55:57.079
Lady: Someone says something, I get
a little nervous. When someone gets
sick, I get very nervous (UNCLEAR).

00:55:57.079 --> 00:56:00.778
Shri Mataji: Madam, if you just keep
silent, it will be fine. Your
energy will get established a bit.

00:56:00.778 --> 00:56:04.220
Talking too much also sometimes
wastes a lot of energy.

00:56:04.220 --> 00:56:07.185
Have to reduce talking. Sahaja yogis
should not speak too much.

00:56:07.926 --> 00:56:14.276
Now go, if everyone delays, it will
take hours. No feet, no feet.

00:56:14.276 --> 00:56:16.157
Seeker: I have only one kidney.
Shri Mataji: Annh?

00:56:16.157 --> 00:56:18.666
Seeker: I have only one kidney.
Shri Mataji: It's alright, doesn't matter.

00:56:18.666 --> 00:56:22.547
After Sahaja yoga there is no problem.
Take lot of barley water, that's all.

00:56:22.547 --> 00:56:25.049
Sahaj yogi: Pressure is going up
Shri Mataji: Annh?

00:56:25.049 --> 00:56:28.457
Sahaj yogi: Pressure, blood pressure is
going up because of one kidney is
only functioning

00:56:28.457 --> 00:56:32.633
Shri Mataji: Take barley water and for
blood pressure - which, which kidney
you have got?

00:56:32.633 --> 00:56:36.387
Sahaj Yogi: Remove, left kidney
removed and only right kidney

00:56:36.387 --> 00:56:40.795
Shri Mataji: Left to the right, all the time
so blood pressure will be alright.
Sahaj Yogi: Left to the right?

00:56:40.795 --> 00:56:43.429
Shri Mataji: Bas, left to the right

00:56:43.429 --> 00:56:48.386
Sahaj Yogi: And there is a difference
between blood pressure between
left hand and right hand

00:56:48.386 --> 00:56:51.973
Is there more in the right hand, Mataji?
Shri Mataji: So with the right hand,
left to the right.

00:56:51.973 --> 00:56:55.793
Sahaja Yogi: Left to the right, same 108?

00:56:55.793 --> 00:56:59.413
Shri Mataji: Left to the right, understand,
left to the right, blood pressure
will come down.

00:56:59.660 --> 00:57:02.705
Sahaja Yogi: And foot soak?
Shri Mataji: Huh?
Sahaja Yogi: Foot soak?

00:57:04.042 --> 00:57:07.182
Lady: He didn't take it, he was in the hostel.
Shri Mataji: What?

00:57:07.182 --> 00:57:13.421
Lady: Please put Your hand on his head a bit.
Shri Mataji: You should not do like this.
You should not tell Mother to do this or that.

00:57:13.421 --> 00:57:15.741
Sahaja yogi: That will take care of the
right kidney also, right to the left,

00:57:15.741 --> 00:57:20.614
that will take care of the right kidney
also that should function
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, left to the right

00:57:24.356 --> 00:57:28.553
Shri Mataji: Which spleen you have?
What work you do?
Sahaj Yogi: No, I'm not doing

00:57:28.755 --> 00:57:31.375
Shri Mataji: Is he realized?
Sahaja Yogi: No

00:57:31.375 --> 00:57:34.814
Shri Mataji: No, no, give him
realization. Don't talk
about people who are not realized.

00:57:34.814 --> 00:57:36.988
Give them realization, okay,
then we'll see.

00:57:36.988 --> 00:57:40.752
They must get realization. Don't treat
people who are not realized.

00:57:41.967 --> 00:57:45.697
Sahaja Yogi(Doctor): And come to the
7 o'clock program tomorrow morning
for any further questions.

00:57:54.736 --> 00:57:59.308
Lady: Mother, please give blessings.
Shri Mataji: I have given.

00:58:07.823 --> 00:58:11.975
Sahaja Yogi (Doctor): Come on son,
please come on. Come on son, come on.

00:58:11.975 --> 00:58:15.973
Sadhak: Mother, please bless both of them.
Sahaja Yogi (Doctor): Mother has
already blessed you so much.

00:58:15.973 --> 00:58:17.505
Shri Mataji: Infinite blessings.

00:58:17.505 --> 00:58:21.021
Seeker: She gives me a lot of
happiness. Whatever trouble
there is is from my side.

00:58:21.021 --> 00:58:26.448
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogi (Doctor): Come on,
come on, come on, yes please.

00:58:34.090 --> 00:58:42.840
Shri Mataji: Yes, do it. But you just
do left to the right. Eat a little
sugar, okay, and don't overdo it.

00:58:42.840 --> 00:58:47.758
Your condition is still very bad.
You do like this, you eat sugar,
eat lots of sugar, sugar cane,

00:58:47.758 --> 00:58:57.136
sugar cane juice, eat sugar, will
cool you down. There is too much liver.
Too much liver. Yes, eat Liv 52.

00:58:57.136 --> 00:59:10.606
Take Liv 52 for one year, very ... too
much liver (UNCLEAR). Give him
sugar. Sugar (UNCLEAR)

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:28.691
Haan, he's very good. He's very good.

00:59:28.691 --> 00:59:33.386
He just needs to get his left nabhi fixed.
His case with his wife is not good.

00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:39.080
Her attention is also not in the
proper place. Wobbly, she keeps
looking here and there.

00:59:39.915 --> 00:59:43.915
Yes, just fix her attention -
chitt is like this.

00:59:47.277 --> 01:00:05.657
Yes, what's this, tell now. Lion family.
Your condition has worsened. Okay, tell Me.

01:00:08.867 --> 01:00:14.947
Are you okay? Feeling well? Feeling good?
It is fine. Now stay well.

01:00:15.022 --> 01:00:25.052
Just cool down a little, be cool. Talk
less, keep a betel nut in your mouth,
talk less. Telling your wife. Stop talking.

01:00:28.094 --> 01:00:32.894
Yes, how are you? Are you okay?
Cured your husband yesterday.

01:00:33.124 --> 01:00:40.204
Lady: (UNCLEAR)
Shri Mataji: Be happy, live long. (Okay)Go.

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:44.712
Lady: I think the saree is with me only.
Shri Mataji: Which one?

01:00:44.712 --> 01:00:49.273
Lady: You are looking for a saree
with red border. I checked but
it is not in the wardrobe.

01:00:49.273 --> 01:00:54.313
Shri Mataji: No, no, I don't have it.
Lady: No, I looked for it in the
wardrobe. Must be with me only.

01:00:54.313 --> 01:01:04.325
[Conversation between Shri Mataji
and a lady regarding a saree]

01:01:10.326 --> 01:01:15.556
How are you? Your sister is looking
better now. What's this?
No, no, no, not this.

01:01:15.556 --> 01:01:20.154
Lady: No, not like this.
Shri Mataji: No, no, what is this madness?
No, no, look now, I don't take anything.

01:01:20.154 --> 01:01:26.050
Not this, not this, child what's this,
what is this? This is the limit. Just see.

01:01:26.050 --> 01:01:30.829
I don't take anything child, then there
is no reason to cry. I'm telling you
the truth, I don't take anything.
You can ask anyone.

01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:36.060
Sahaja Yogi(Doctor): Please go sister-in-law,
we'll talk later, right? Come on.

01:01:38.717 --> 01:01:42.624
Shri Mataji: You are so lovely, then
what is the need to cry, isn't it?

01:01:42.624 --> 01:01:48.477
As it is there are so many things
to cry about.
Sahaja Yogi(Doctor): Now the time
has come to laugh.

01:01:49.696 --> 01:01:53.746
Shri Mataji: Her mother-in-law is not proper.
Sahaja Yogi(Doctor): Now is the time to laugh.

01:01:54.218 --> 01:01:57.608
Shri Mataji: Sit down now, you sit down,
later I'll see, I'll explain it to you.

01:01:57.608 --> 01:02:00.075
Lady: I want to ask You one thing
Shri Mataji: Hmm?

01:02:00.075 --> 01:02:08.640
[UNCLEAR CONVERSATION BETWEEN
SHRI MATAJI AND LADY]

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.536
Shri Mataji: Where is inflammation?

01:02:10.536 --> 01:02:19.599
Lady: It was retina inflammation. It's
wrong about sinusitis [UNCLEAR] so if
I see with one eye it's a blurred picture.

01:02:19.599 --> 01:02:22.520
Shri Mataji: Achcha, doctor had the
same problem. You tell him what he did.

01:02:22.520 --> 01:02:26.586
You tell him, achcha you go and tell him
he'll tell you what he did.

01:02:29.351 --> 01:02:30.681
Anything else?

01:02:30.681 --> 01:02:37.068
Sahaja Yogi: This is the family which
has made all the arrangements.
Shri Mataji: Many, many thanks to you.
Many thanks.

01:02:37.068 --> 01:02:41.667
Sahaja Yogi (Doctor): He is brother's father.
Shri Mataji: He is very fine.

01:02:46.836 --> 01:02:54.076
Yes, you people have really a good -
the biggest thing is that, a new dimension,

01:02:54.076 --> 01:02:58.862
dimension, a new dimension has opened
up for you. And once it opens up -

01:02:58.862 --> 01:03:04.483
So I used to think how to approach
these people. They called Me in Rotary club

01:03:04.483 --> 01:03:10.821
also asked multiple questions there,
did everything, gave realization to
many people but it didn't work out.

01:03:10.821 --> 01:03:16.672
And now the Lions Club people, because
perhaps I have a greater connection
with them, even more than with the Chakras.

01:03:18.810 --> 01:03:23.650
Seeker: That's why You love more
Shri Mataji: Love more - it's since
childhood, you don't know about Me

01:03:23.650 --> 01:03:30.310
Before I was born, My mother had a desire
to see an uncaged lion in the jungle.

01:03:30.310 --> 01:03:34.300
So My father said, "It is your
eighth month, now how will I
take you to the jungle,"

01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:37.879
"and you see the lion, so how will it be;
also there is no lion there right now?"

01:03:37.879 --> 01:03:42.084
Then there was the Maharaja of Khirchipur
- My father was a hunter - so he
sent the message

01:03:42.084 --> 01:03:46.975
that, "A big lion has come out here
and it is so huge, and don't know"

01:03:46.975 --> 01:03:51.130
"whether it is a man-eater or not,
but you come and finish him off."

01:03:51.130 --> 01:03:56.700
So My father said, "Look, the news has
come, are you coming?" So My mother
said, "Yes, I want to see the lion."

01:03:56.700 --> 01:04:04.282
So when they went there in the jungle,
My mother tells Me, "It was a full moon
day that day, there was complete
brightness all around."

01:04:04.282 --> 01:04:08.089
And at that time they saw that the
majestic lion was coming with great pride.

01:04:08.089 --> 01:04:14.488
So when My  father picked up the gun,
mother grabbed his gun and said,
"Beware, do not kill him."

01:04:14.488 --> 01:04:17.322
"Whatever happens, he is not to be killed."
So he could not understand what had
happened to her.

01:04:17.322 --> 01:04:20.081
She started saying that, 'No, enough'
- 'So tightly,' he started saying that,
'Your mother held the gun,

01:04:20.081 --> 01:04:23.140
that, 'I thought that some power has
come inside you, or what?'

01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:25.444
Because eighth month, as it is a
woman is weak

01:04:25.444 --> 01:04:30.992
He said, 'She snatched the gun from
my hand with such force that' -

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:34.610
My father was a very healthy man, so he
could not understand what had happened?

01:04:34.610 --> 01:04:37.938
So after that when the lion went away,
then was not seen by anybody.

01:04:37.938 --> 01:04:42.635
So My father said, "Now someone of Shakti
is going to be born in your womb,"

01:04:42.635 --> 01:04:47.764
"Because I have never seen anyone
snatching a gun from me, as you
snatched the gun from me like this."

01:04:47.764 --> 01:04:52.011
Then after that, recently Rajesh is
telling Me that we have some land there,

01:04:52.011 --> 01:04:55.098
in which we people want to open a
good school for children.

01:04:55.098 --> 01:05:00.326
So that land is, it is 42 acres of
land, but all the people from
the village come there.

01:05:00.326 --> 01:05:05.631
These people have also done some
farming there and planted a few trees,
so the villagers come and disturb them.

01:05:05.932 --> 01:05:10.862
So they called Me and said, "Mother,
what should we do, these people come
like this, this happens, that happens."

01:05:10.862 --> 01:05:14.141
And it is said that after a few days
they saw a huge big lion there.

01:05:14.141 --> 01:05:17.585
And it was running here and there,
shouting loudly, everyone

01:05:17.585 --> 01:05:21.448
everybody picked up their bedding and
clothes, gathered everything from there -

01:05:21.448 --> 01:05:24.618
and for two-three days he appeared
(showed his presence)
quite a lot and then disappeared.

01:05:24.618 --> 01:05:29.499
And there are never lions in that area.
Everyone was surprised how did the lion come.

01:05:29.499 --> 01:05:32.684
Now the lions are sitting here
right in front of us.

01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:40.110
Sahaj yogi(Doctor): They presented a
beautiful lion yesterday to You.

01:05:40.110 --> 01:05:45.816
Shri Mataji: Haan, beautiful!
Yes okay, take that along, carry
along My lion there.

01:05:46.535 --> 01:05:56.015
Rajesh, you must see that that lion
goes with Me. I'll take it to London.
Alright, thank you!

01:05:57.388 --> 01:06:00.448
Sahaja Yogi: Please display it.
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes we will keep
it in London.

01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:09.078
This is the first time I have received a
momento. My husband receives many momentos,

01:06:09.078 --> 01:06:11.771
gets medals from all over the world,
gets this, gets that.

01:06:11.771 --> 01:06:14.437
Sahaja Yogi (Doctor): You keep giving.
Shri Mataji: I keep giving.

01:06:14.437 --> 01:06:18.185
And he displays everything in the office,
somewhere cats, somewhere rats,
other things somewhere else.

01:06:18.185 --> 01:06:22.417
Now I will tell him, 'I have a
lion, what do you have?"

01:06:25.686 --> 01:06:28.586
Sahaja Yogi (Doctor): No, it was very
appropriate for the occasion, Mother.

01:06:28.586 --> 01:06:32.119
shri Mataji: Absolutely, I really fell
in love with it, I tell you really.

01:06:32.119 --> 01:06:40.377
I don't know why, but when my husband was
in Lucknow, there was a zoo nearby, so I
used to wake up early in the morning
and go there to see the lions and others.

01:06:40.548 --> 01:06:48.508
I am never afraid of these ever.
Seeker: Give us some message.

01:06:49.322 --> 01:06:55.882
Shri Mataji: What message should I
give you? You people have opened
up a very big path

01:06:55.882 --> 01:07:02.868
has been created for Sahaja Yoga and
a way for other people as well.
It has become a very big thing

01:07:04.360 --> 01:07:12.780
and I want to say only this that it should
be understood that whatever activities
the Lions Club has carried out till date,

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:19.370
those were very good; you people were
doing a great job, everything was there

01:07:19.518 --> 01:07:27.428
but when any person does any of it's
inner works without Self-realization,

01:07:27.428 --> 01:07:31.535
then the first feeling that comes
within him is, 'I am doing this work.'

01:07:31.815 --> 01:07:40.605
The feeling of doing work creates an
egoistic feeling in us knowingly or
unknowingly.

01:07:40.692 --> 01:07:49.152
Then egos clash, fights happen, quarrels
happen, and this kind of discord
keeps happening.

01:07:49.967 --> 01:07:58.067
Now after Sahaja Yoga, as I say, I have
opened here. By opening it, through this
hole, all these things will come out.

01:07:58.067 --> 01:08:04.753
'I am saying something, I am doing something,'
will not happen like this. You will say,
'It's happening, it's going, it's being made.'

01:08:04.753 --> 01:08:10.685
You will start speaking in the third
person. So all the troubles caused
by ego will be destroyed.

01:08:10.685 --> 01:08:15.600
They're not going to be there. Now the
fights and quarrels will reduce to a
great extent and there will be brotherhood.

01:08:15.600 --> 01:08:19.160
And there will be no thought as
to who is high and who is low.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:24.830
Everyone will look at this thing
with equanimity. Whatever your
ideals are, will come true.

01:08:24.830 --> 01:08:30.583
Now as people say that democracy is
very good, communism is bad -

01:08:30.583 --> 01:08:34.825
Somebody says communism is good, now
capitalism is bad [UNCLEAR - thought?].

01:08:34.825 --> 01:08:41.438
Now we will say that in Sahaja Yoga we
are the biggest capitalists because the
whole matter is in our hands - isn't it?

01:08:41.798 --> 01:08:46.518
And are also the biggest communists
because there is no peace without sharing.

01:08:46.518 --> 01:08:51.422
So all the human theories have
their concrete form only when,

01:08:51.422 --> 01:08:55.664
when they become enlightened; otherwise
it does not have a real form.

01:08:55.664 --> 01:09:01.531
All your theories about the lion(Club)
have now worked out because they
have been infused with power.

01:09:01.531 --> 01:09:07.131
Now if there is a lion - you are a lion,
you see many lions have been created
in this way, just falsely.

01:09:07.131 --> 01:09:11.598
You must have seen how many lions are there.
There is no flow of power in them.

01:09:11.598 --> 01:09:16.721
People may greet or say anything. Now
that flow of energy has come into you.

01:09:16.721 --> 01:09:20.433
And how appropriate it is that in
Calcutta, where the Goddess is so revered,

01:09:20.433 --> 01:09:26.199
where the Goddess rode a lion -
the lion is on the right side,
the tiger is on the left side -

01:09:26.418 --> 01:09:31.738
killed while riding a lion; so that
lion which you people have accepted  -

01:09:31.738 --> 01:09:35.758
also see how much planning there is
of God, that where did it start from.

01:09:35.758 --> 01:09:41.623
That your founder thought about the
lion - it came and flourished only
in Calcutta

01:09:42.749 --> 01:09:46.879
And She killed while riding a lion
- did not kill while riding a tiger.

01:09:46.879 --> 01:09:50.992
So it is believed that Durga Ji
rides a lion.

01:09:50.992 --> 01:09:56.649
And She killed Mahishasura here.
And Mahishasura was killed by Kali.

01:09:56.829 --> 01:10:04.519
So at that time Mahishasura was such an
evil demon and his emotions were so bad

01:10:04.519 --> 01:10:08.996
he used to keep himself well-groomed,
so he looked a bit good too.

01:10:08.996 --> 01:10:13.017
So people used to think, 'Well, how can
such a good looking man be a demon?'

01:10:13.017 --> 01:10:18.353
She destroyed him so much, destroyed
him so much, but he has risen
(apperared) again.

01:10:18.353 --> 01:10:23.873
Someday I will tell you who he is,
and he came here. You people
worshipped his feet a lot,
everything happened;

01:10:23.873 --> 01:10:29.315
He created a lot of terror in Bengal.
And ever since he set his foot here,
Bengal has drowned.

01:10:29.940 --> 01:10:36.470
Since then, things went wrong here,
everyone's mind got confused,
everything went haywire, because
of that everything got spoiled.

01:10:36.470 --> 01:10:42.038
Sahaja Yogi: Is he alive?
Shri Mataji: He is quite alive. He
came here, keeps coming.

01:10:42.038 --> 01:10:46.773
Now since you are Sahaja Yogis, so I'll
tell his name - he is Sathya Sai Baba.

01:10:46.841 --> 01:10:50.581
I caught him for the first time in
Calcutta; This too is amazing.

01:10:50.581 --> 01:10:55.759
When I was going to America, I came
here. A lady came to My feet
then I got blisters.

01:10:55.759 --> 01:10:59.305
I said, who is the one here giving
Me blisters?

01:10:59.305 --> 01:11:02.334
So I asked her, "Who is your Guru?"
Then she told Me his name.

01:11:02.367 --> 01:11:05.737
I closed My eyes and saw that
(he) looked exactly like a buffalo.

01:11:06.453 --> 01:11:10.203
His face is like that of a buffalo,
if you see his skin
even that is like a buffalo.

01:11:10.203 --> 01:11:18.317
'Well,' I said, 'you've come in the way.'
Now gradually I am reducing his importance.

01:11:18.317 --> 01:11:20.480
Am reducing the number of his disciples.

01:11:20.480 --> 01:11:25.847
Whosoever believed in that man has
had heart attacks. You can ask
anyone you want.

01:11:27.563 --> 01:11:32.693
And here in Calcutta they made such a
loud show that they got the roads blocked.

01:11:35.782 --> 01:11:38.462
Sahaja Yogi: The locals had quite
(UNCLEAR ) him.

01:11:38.462 --> 01:11:43.503
Shri Mataji: Very much. That is when
all your troubles came - you see,
before that Calcutta was not so bad.

01:11:43.503 --> 01:11:47.855
All the troubles of Calcutta happened
because of his footsteps coming here.

01:11:48.019 --> 01:11:52.669
Since then Calcutta has been sinking,
sinking, sinking, sinking, absolutely
in such a condition - now we will save it.

01:11:52.703 --> 01:11:56.633
Now prosperity will come here, wealth
will come, everything will be fine.

01:11:57.091 --> 01:12:02.271
But you should give importance to the
handicraftsmanship here, because
in the whole world

01:12:02.271 --> 01:12:07.740
now there is no handicraftsmanship and
we have to work hard on this
handicraftsmanship.

01:12:11.047 --> 01:12:17.847
Sahaja Yogi: Regarding school your ..?
Shri Mataji: Yes, we want to build a
school there in Vaitarna

01:12:17.847 --> 01:12:22.163
because it's environment is very good.
It is not in the city. Outside the city -

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:26.771
from there, from Bombay, I think, it
takes about an hour and a half to go.

01:12:26.771 --> 01:12:31.949
And you must have read the word
Vaitarna that Vaitarna, to cross
the ocean of illusion - Vaitarna,

01:12:31.949 --> 01:12:35.965
have crossed the Vaitarna, have crossed
from the Vaitarna, this is what is said.

01:12:35.965 --> 01:12:39.547
This place is over there, it is 42 acres
of land, a very beautiful place.

01:12:39.547 --> 01:12:44.392
And we have got it, and want to build
a school there, and I'm thinking

01:12:44.392 --> 01:12:49.735
that such a school should be built,
where our Indian ideals are
placed before the children.

01:12:49.735 --> 01:12:55.321
And they should be brought up with Indianness,
there should be discipline in them,
they should serve their parents,

01:12:55.321 --> 01:13:00.591
respecting their parents, respecting
their teachers. Our children are
totally misguided these days.

01:13:00.591 --> 01:13:04.616
And they have to be made into a very
good Indianized Indian.

01:13:04.616 --> 01:13:09.088
But I thought in the beginning it
happens, why there are no schools?

01:13:09.088 --> 01:13:12.144
Because the investment involved
is huge, the income is very low.

01:13:12.144 --> 01:13:14.754
If any school is built, it will
cost crores.

01:13:14.754 --> 01:13:18.739
And there isn't any income, so that's
why people don't build schools.

01:13:18.739 --> 01:13:23.299
Reason is that it's not a very
productive thing. That's why
these people don't build schools.

01:13:23.299 --> 01:13:25.020
Sahaj Yogi: You have to spend a lot of money.

01:13:25.020 --> 01:13:29.258
Shri Mataji: Lot of money to establish a
school and to run the school also of
a high standard.

01:13:29.258 --> 01:13:33.540
So I thought that people from abroad
too - people from abroad are
very interested.

01:13:33.540 --> 01:13:37.734
Their children will also be called there
and the very highest type of education

01:13:37.734 --> 01:13:43.542
because we have such teachers who
have worked in International schools
in Switzerland

01:13:43.542 --> 01:13:50.367
and those who have lived in other places
too and are Sahaja Yogis. We want to
establish a school by calling such people

01:13:50.367 --> 01:13:52.362
and disciplined and very good

01:13:52.362 --> 01:13:59.019
and they will be given complete,
comprehensive knowledge about our country

01:13:59.019 --> 01:14:04.384
so that they know what a great
country this is and apart from
this about other countries.

01:14:04.384 --> 01:14:06.789
We have created a very good
education system.

01:14:06.789 --> 01:14:10.643
Now a school was built in Australia
according to this education system.

01:14:10.643 --> 01:14:15.557
The government gave such good certificates
for that school that, "We have never
seen a school like this,"

01:14:15.557 --> 01:14:20.747
"And these people do what they say.
What they have said that the
school should be this,"

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:25.882
"Likewise children were found there,
very disciplined, very lovely children,"
and it's a very good description.

01:14:25.882 --> 01:14:32.148
So now I'm thinking of starting a
school there and probably it
will start in a year or two.

01:14:32.522 --> 01:14:39.312
Want children above the age of ten to
come there. Taking children below the
age of ten or from the age of nine,

01:14:39.312 --> 01:14:44.744
let's say from when high school starts.
Which - when does first start?
When does primary end?

01:14:44.787 --> 01:14:49.485
Sahaja Yogi: From sixth
Shri Mataji: No, when does primary end?

01:14:49.485 --> 01:14:56.658
Sahaja Yogi: Primary is up to fifth.
Shri Mataji: It is up to fifth. So what
is the age of the child approximately?

01:14:56.658 --> 01:15:01.837
Sahaja Yogi: Ten
Shri Mataji: About ten. So they
will take children from ten years.
Will start from there.

01:15:01.837 --> 01:15:04.906
Later, we can do it for small
children also everywhere.

01:15:04.906 --> 01:15:08.921
Like for Calcutta, for every place,
we will start one for small children also.

01:15:08.921 --> 01:15:12.317
Because here that would have to be
in the city, not outside the city.

01:15:12.317 --> 01:15:15.895
But they are building a school
outside the city and this is a
request to you people that,

01:15:15.895 --> 01:15:20.280
if you people could also help in
this, it would be a great favor.

01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.977
Because money will come from abroad
- they are ready to give it - but
the problem with that is that

01:15:24.977 --> 01:15:31.896
go to the Reserve Bank, do this with it,
do that, give account of every
single penny, it is a hassle.

01:15:36.957 --> 01:15:41.417
Seeker: It was very good that we
had this program

01:15:43.022 --> 01:15:47.942
This should be understood simply that
an awakening has taken place within us.

01:15:47.942 --> 01:15:50.959
Shri Mataji: It has come.
Seeker: Now its follow-up will
have to be done.

01:15:51.386 --> 01:15:54.756
Regarding its follow-up, that today
in the Kali Yuga (UNCLEAR)

01:15:54.756 --> 01:15:58.616
if someone does not witness miracles,
doesn't get results, then people

01:15:58.616 --> 01:15:59.959
Shri Mataji: Will run away.

01:15:59.959 --> 01:16:03.395
Seeker: Our logical intelligence is such
that we think logically about everything.

01:16:03.395 --> 01:16:07.128
There is a big difference between
adopting something with faith
and taking it by logic.

01:16:07.128 --> 01:16:10.783
Shri Mataji: No, no, you'll experience
many miracles. There is no dearth
of miracles.

01:16:10.783 --> 01:16:16.248
Seeker: It is like this that the
Sahaja Yogis who are now here in
your Calcutta branch, told me that

01:16:16.248 --> 01:16:21.136
(UNCLEAR) they come fully to Sahaj
and do all practices and whatever else

01:16:21.136 --> 01:16:24.062
with this maybe fifty to hundred
more may come

01:16:24.062 --> 01:16:29.413
because what we see is that many
people come on some pretext,
they come only to see.

01:16:29.413 --> 01:16:32.924
Half the people who also come to us
if all of them become Sahaj Yogis,
then what a wonderful thing!

01:16:32.924 --> 01:16:34.950
Shri Mataji: That is a difficult task.
Seeker: Yes, it is difficult.

01:16:34.950 --> 01:16:38.363
Seeker: Now 20-50 more people can
come in it, but we want that

01:16:38.363 --> 01:16:41.440
the link that has been formed, that
link must shoulder the responsibility

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:48.083
Yogis or should open a club like
'Lions Club of Calcutta Sahaja Yogis'

01:16:48.083 --> 01:16:52.592
which gets all the schools (UNCLEAR)
in the movement of our Lion

01:16:52.592 --> 01:16:57.059
or if 5-5, 7-7 members go to different
clubs - what will happen with that?

01:16:57.059 --> 01:16:59.616
Shri Mataji: Should converse there?
Seeker: Exchange of ideas amongst ourselves

01:16:59.616 --> 01:17:05.126
Because we have seen that the sermons
that You have given, which we have
heard (UNCLEAR - You use?)

01:17:05.126 --> 01:17:10.015
So, in that what You and I have
(Views) is very similar.
Shri Mataji: Absolutely.

01:17:10.015 --> 01:17:14.181
Seeker: Means I have a lot of
difficulty finding this, like You
were speaking about collectivity,

01:17:14.181 --> 01:17:20.317
were talking about surrender, were
talking about professional understanding,
so the biggest thing that I felt

01:17:20.317 --> 01:17:27.434
was that You have, all the religions of
the world and all the people, that is,
wherever there are good and virtuous people

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:31.721
Shri Mataji: We should praise them.
Seeker: Whether they are in China,
whether among the Muslims;

01:17:31.721 --> 01:17:35.324
Like what happens among us, is that
Hindus have a little allergic manner.

01:17:35.324 --> 01:17:39.260
When Hindus take the name of Muslims,
it creates a slight allergy in the mind

01:17:39.260 --> 01:17:42.678
Shri Mataji: Tell everyone to say
'Allah ho Akbar', then everyone
will become a Muslim.

01:17:43.499 --> 01:17:46.424
Seeker: So what it is that
Sahaja Yogi: Will not drink their water

01:17:46.424 --> 01:17:50.739
Shri Mataji: No, let Me tell you,
what you said is sort of correct,
but I'll tell such an analogy

01:17:50.739 --> 01:17:56.784
as is said, 'Well, the saddle, the reins,
the mare, everything is there,' but the
groom was missing, that groom has also arrived.

01:17:58.353 --> 01:18:03.993
That is the thing. The groom is your
Spirit, the Spirit should be awakened,
your own power should be awakened.

01:18:03.993 --> 01:18:08.399
The ideals were complete, but the
nectar had to be added to them,
that nectar has now arrived.

01:18:08.399 --> 01:18:13.995
Now what you said that these people
should join or do something, it is
their wish, they can join anything.

01:18:13.995 --> 01:18:20.205
There is nothing that should not do
or it is not this, but in reality
you have to take advantage from them.

01:18:20.205 --> 01:18:26.606
So you do this tell the Lion's
Club people that, "These want
to be member of your club."

01:18:26.606 --> 01:18:30.932
Whosoever wants to be, there is no
pressure on anyone, whatever one
wants to do can do - yes

01:18:30.932 --> 01:18:36.237
And now see it's this, whatever is
your job of curing diseases or anything,

01:18:36.237 --> 01:18:40.859
so the first thing would be is to
first cure the sick, so in that
also I am saying,

01:18:40.859 --> 01:18:45.358
that you will have to work on the
photo first, because if you try to
do it yourself, you will get caught.

01:18:45.358 --> 01:18:47.729
Do not put your hands. You do
on the photo first.

01:18:47.729 --> 01:18:52.467
Now you cannot give the photo on
behalf of Lions Club, you can
give it on behalf of Sahaja Yoga.

01:18:52.467 --> 01:18:55.401
Suppose if a sick man comes to
your Lion's Club,

01:18:55.401 --> 01:18:57.360
then tell him, "You go, Sahaja
Yogis are there."

01:18:57.360 --> 01:18:59.229
Seeker: We will do like this only.
Shri Mataji: Yes, will have to do
like this.

01:18:59.229 --> 01:19:02.064
Because you will not be able to
distribute the photo on behalf
of the Lions Club

01:19:02.064 --> 01:19:06.407
Yes, but suppose if a person gets well,
someone's health is restored,

01:19:06.407 --> 01:19:10.585
then he should print My photos for
free and distribute them to others.

01:19:10.585 --> 01:19:17.623
Has two thousand photos printed - may
not give so much money but only if he
distributes the photos, it would
be a big advantage.

01:19:17.623 --> 01:19:24.839
Many things can be done in this way.
So if there is a sick person, send
him and tell him to meditate.

01:19:24.839 --> 01:19:33.668
Should not only look for all the sick people;
there should be some who are strong too.
Otherwise there will be a long queue
of sick people.

01:19:34.864 --> 01:19:40.964
Those who are interested in this,
those who want to find God,
send such people only.

01:19:40.964 --> 01:19:46.762
Because what happens is, you people are
treating useless people - do it, because
you are virtuous/religious people, do it.

01:19:46.762 --> 01:19:53.686
But I say, what is the use of
repairing those lamps which are
not going to give any light?

01:19:55.410 --> 01:20:01.740
It is not practical. The lamp that
will not give light - now understand
that this is a light, it has gone bad

01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:06.458
Now they said, "Alright, now will
fix it for you for beautification,
but it is not going to give light."

01:20:06.458 --> 01:20:12.568
I say, 'Let it go to Hell - why do it?'
This is it. A person should accept
the idea that it is a useless thing.

01:20:12.568 --> 01:20:18.009
Do practical things. Practical is
that the person who seeks God, is fine.

01:20:18.009 --> 01:20:20.960
Must give to him because he will
then further give light.

01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:23.940
Otherwise you cured a person,
cured a person's eye,

01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:27.924
then what does he do with his eyes?
Is he doing good deeds or bad deeds?

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:32.316
This eye is also a very deceptive
thing. Christ has said,

01:20:32.316 --> 01:20:37.392
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."
What a subtle thing he has said, see!

01:20:37.392 --> 01:20:40.928
And whatever Christians there are,
have eyes that are even greater
than adulterous.

01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:46.670
And we have greedy eyes.
We get greedy for everything.

01:20:46.670 --> 01:20:49.500
Snatch this from him, then snatch
that from him, then take this from him.

01:20:51.930 --> 01:20:54.793
Sahaja Yogi: All other brothers
should go who have no other...
Shri Mataji: Okay.

01:20:55.726 --> 01:20:58.086
Seeker: You discussed about school.
Shri Mataji: Yes

01:20:58.086 --> 01:21:04.950
Seeker: So here we want, that the schooling
that has been going on in Calcutta
for the last 10-15 years is good.

01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:11.227
In my opinion now new schooling
somewhat(UNCLEAR)(UNCLEAR) are also
coming up right now; there is so
much problem that

01:21:11.227 --> 01:21:18.457
in order to go to any good school, I mean
even to go to primary school, I mean
(UNCLEAR) thousand-thousand, five hundred

01:21:18.457 --> 01:21:22.758
So in such a situation we should pay
attention to
Shri Mataji: Making a Sahaj school?

01:21:22.758 --> 01:21:26.194
Seeker: No, we will make it on behalf
of Lions only but in it it's that

01:21:26.194 --> 01:21:30.057
as You just said that, either the
Sahaja Yogis make it and we
cooperate in that.

01:21:30.057 --> 01:21:34.383
Shri Mataji: You can easily make a
Sahaj School. We can all help you
with/in that.

01:21:34.383 --> 01:21:39.360
We can send teachers. Everything
else can be arranged from outside
- if it is a Sahaj school.

01:21:39.360 --> 01:21:44.762
Because there are many Sahaja Yogis
who can do it. But first make it for
children younger than ten years.

01:21:44.762 --> 01:21:49.131
Because when the children turn ten
years old, we will take them there.
Then you build a bigger school.

01:21:49.131 --> 01:21:53.761
There is no benefit in keeping children
who are older than ten years
in schools within the city.

01:21:53.761 --> 01:21:58.380
If you want to do some real work, want
to do solid work, want to do
substantial work.

01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:02.684
Otherwise there are schools like this.
Arranging/Managing a school is not a
special task.

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:06.472
The task is to have such children
that each one of them turns out
to be a Shivaji.

01:22:07.042 --> 01:22:11.081
Seeker: In this, there is a way
through the trick that You told us.

01:22:11.081 --> 01:22:18.225
It is like this that if suppose someone
agrees to promote tourism in a foreign
country, then that our Lions Foundation

01:22:18.225 --> 01:22:23.711
Shri Mataji: They will not give. If they
are Sahaja Yogis, then they will never
give to the Lions, let Me tell you. They'll
say that we'll give to ourselves only.

01:22:23.711 --> 01:22:27.962
Seeker: No, but if they are told that
this school is being built according
to our wishes/standards only.

01:22:27.962 --> 01:22:33.503
Shri Mataji: No, can do this that if you
build a Sahaj School, build a Sahaj School,
then they'll give to the Sahaj School.

01:22:36.777 --> 01:22:39.677
Sahaja Yogi: We have collaborated,
right? We are collaborating na.
There is no harm.

01:22:40.182 --> 01:22:42.952
Shri Mataji: But if its name is
Sahaj School, then… See, it's
a straightforward thing.

01:22:42.952 --> 01:22:47.181
If there's a Sahaj school, they'll give,
otherwise they have become true Mahasahaja
Yogis. They'll not give to anyone else at all.

01:22:47.181 --> 01:22:51.790
Sahaj Yogi(Doctor): No Mataji, he is
saying the other way round that
the Lions International

01:22:52.632 --> 01:22:55.442
Shri Mataji: International School will
give?

01:22:55.442 --> 01:23:00.051
Sahaja Yogi (Doctor): There is an
International Foundation, so
they give money from that.

01:23:00.051 --> 01:23:02.914
Shri Mataji: Will your Lions people give it?
Seeker: Yes, no, the Lions people will give.

01:23:02.914 --> 01:23:05.314
Sahaja Yoga: Mataji, the problem
You told about the Reserve Bank

01:23:05.314 --> 01:23:09.723
that for the problem that occurs in
repatriation, he has told a via media
that they,

01:23:09.723 --> 01:23:13.056
if Sahaja Yogis there make a contribution
to the Lions Club International Foundation

01:23:13.056 --> 01:23:18.635
Shri Mataji: No, they will not do, they
will not do. They will not do it at
all because the thing is like this

01:23:18.635 --> 01:23:22.984
See, I'll tell the reason for this,
tell the reason for this brother,
the reason for this is that,

01:23:22.984 --> 01:23:31.609
the contributions that they have made
right now are only - they have their
own Trusts formed there -
they have made to their Trusts.

01:23:31.609 --> 01:23:37.288
It is written in it that, 'We have
given this for the work of Sahaja Yoga.'
So they cannot give it to anyone.

01:23:37.288 --> 01:23:41.903
Under their own rules and regulations.
It's not question of

01:23:41.903 --> 01:23:46.762
And as far as donation is concerned
- in Sahaja yoga we do not give
any donation to anyone else.

01:23:46.762 --> 01:23:51.056
Because anyone can to us - we don't
take money from anyone, you think
about it.

01:23:51.056 --> 01:23:55.743
So whatever money these people have,
they would like it to be used for
some Sahaja Yoga work only.

01:23:55.743 --> 01:23:59.869
Naturally, because right now we,
these people are growing.

01:23:59.869 --> 01:24:03.309
You people should tell the other
people in the Lions Club that

01:24:03.309 --> 01:24:07.906
we are building a school here,
we need it. They will give it
to you, they can give it to you.

01:24:07.906 --> 01:24:11.189
Seeker: Collaboration is possible.
Shri Mataji: Hmm!
Seeker: See, name they will not do.

01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:14.772
Shri Mataji: No, that will not happen
Sir, it will not happen in matters
of money - everything else,

01:24:14.772 --> 01:24:20.905
because those people have said that
they will use it only for Sahaja
Yoga. This is the problem.

01:24:20.905 --> 01:24:23.737
Sahaja Yogi: 'Lion Sahaja Yoga', two names?
Shri Mataji: They will not accept it, no, no.

01:24:24.172 --> 01:24:27.662
In it will work on only one name here -
Yes, this is a problem.

01:24:27.662 --> 01:24:33.920
The Trust they have formed for
it, that works under one Trust
and they cannot give it.

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:38.283
So these people will not give
money; Whatever else you say.

01:24:38.283 --> 01:24:44.011
You need personnel, they will give;
You need teachers, the very best
teachers will come from abroad

01:24:44.011 --> 01:24:48.252
They will give you know-how, they
will do everything, but they
will not give money.

01:24:48.365 --> 01:24:53.315
If you need know-how in something,
in any industry or in anything,

01:24:53.315 --> 01:24:59.150
so they will come and give it for
free, but will not give money. First
of all they have very little money,

01:24:59.150 --> 01:25:03.251
because I am too, I must say,
a little careless in this matter.

01:25:03.251 --> 01:25:07.858
I say that when it's required, then we
get the money, what is to be done.
They do not have that much money also.

01:25:07.858 --> 01:25:13.410
And whatever is there, they would
like it to be used in Sahaja Yoga
only. What happens with Sahaja Yoga

01:25:13.410 --> 01:25:16.492
Now see, if I tell you how many
programmes we have, you'll be surprised.

01:25:16.958 --> 01:25:26.408
One program is that we have taken a
piece of land; how farming can be
improved there through Sahaja Yoga.

01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:33.680
It has a research centre, there is a
director for it, Mr. Hamid, he himself
is going to come and stay here.

01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:37.595
Now if you put vibrated water in farming
- he has done an experiment -

01:25:37.595 --> 01:25:42.226
he did not even have anything to vibrate
and water in their place is not from
the well, we have from the well

01:25:42.226 --> 01:25:47.648
so he put his ring, which had My
photo in it, inside the tap thus/then
he showed, yes,

01:25:47.648 --> 01:25:54.941
that which were so big - there are
two types of hybrids and two types
of seeds - so on hybrids too

01:25:54.941 --> 01:25:59.550
grew hybrid, it grew this much,
without hybrid it grew this much.

01:25:59.550 --> 01:26:04.871
and without hybrid by adding Sahaja
Yoga water, then it grew so much.

01:26:04.871 --> 01:26:08.408
Many such experiments have been done.
Right now such a drain is being made there

01:26:08.408 --> 01:26:13.023
You'll be surprised they have done
experiments on such drains
with vibrated water,

01:26:13.023 --> 01:26:18.288
that trees which are above sixty years
of age are not affected, all other
trees flourish.

01:26:18.288 --> 01:26:22.136
They have a huge big problem.
So now this is such a big task

01:26:22.136 --> 01:26:24.993
They have made very big charts for that,
everything, everyone is coming

01:26:24.993 --> 01:26:27.868
Sahaja Yogi: In which country?
Shri Mataji: Agriculture. We will
do it here, in India.

01:26:27.868 --> 01:26:32.557
All the work will be done in India
because this is a very big task,
agriculture of our place will improve.

01:26:32.557 --> 01:26:36.944
Now if you go and see the agriculture
of Sahaja yogis, you will say,
'Where has this come from?'

01:26:36.944 --> 01:26:46.737
Such pearl-like grains and even if they
are kept in the storeroom, then rats
don't eat them; rats don't touch,
leave them open.

01:26:46.737 --> 01:26:51.499
Everything they'll eat but will not eat
them. And every fruit you see
is such, papaya -

01:26:51.499 --> 01:26:55.443
if you see the papaya of Sahaja
Yoga, you will not believe that
it is a papaya from India.

01:26:55.945 --> 01:27:02.685
It is so sweet and lasts so long. So
this is the thing to be done to
increase the prosperity of our
country, it will happen through this.

01:27:02.685 --> 01:27:08.449
This is one very big (plan) of theirs.
Our second plan is to promote the
culture of our country.

01:27:08.449 --> 01:27:14.296
It should be such that they should
develop interest. For that we have
acquired lands in Ganapatipule.

01:27:14.296 --> 01:27:18.959
We want to build such schools there
that people from foreign come here

01:27:19.887 --> 01:27:27.257
and they'll give money, quite a lot
they give, and we have thought of
teaching them 21 arts of India, 21 arts.

01:27:27.257 --> 01:27:30.055
Teachers for that - now in our country
so many artists are dying of hunger -

01:27:30.055 --> 01:27:33.997
they don't have anything whatsoever.
We will call them there and they
will teach and train them.

01:27:33.997 --> 01:27:37.239
Will earn a lot of money from it;
they will also get some job etc.

01:27:37.239 --> 01:27:42.975
We will teach them 21 arts. Acquiring
those will develop interest in them.
In future they will invite these
artists there.

01:27:42.975 --> 01:27:46.641
They will have their programs and
they will think about our culture.

01:27:46.641 --> 01:27:49.206
Till now they don't know anything
about our culture.

01:27:49.206 --> 01:27:52.959
Any dance they watch can't understand
it; any music they listen to, can't
understand it.

01:27:52.959 --> 01:27:56.732
Don't understand the ragas and
don't understand our art.

01:27:56.732 --> 01:28:00.233
They impose their art on us,
do not understand our art.

01:28:00.345 --> 01:28:08.805
So this is one plan. So these are the
two big plans are in front of us.
Third is this school that we are building.

01:28:08.805 --> 01:28:14.266
They have given this money also so
that their children can study there
and their condition can improve.

01:28:14.266 --> 01:28:18.716
They also have a little vested interest
in this, that for their children. In this
way, a third institution came into being.

01:28:18.716 --> 01:28:28.256
Well, now the fourth institution that
we are creating is like this that Delhi
University has now accepted Sahaja Yoga,

01:28:28.256 --> 01:28:36.326
that any person who experiments on
Sahaja Yoga, then he will get the degree
of Doctor of Medicine after M.B.B.S.

01:28:36.326 --> 01:28:39.396
After M.B.B.S. So this is a very big
thing.
Sahaja Yogi: It is a very big thing.

01:28:39.396 --> 01:28:42.668
Shri Mataji: So three doctors are
doing here, four doctors are doing
in England.

01:28:42.668 --> 01:28:47.767
For that we have taken a place in
England, near Cambridge, that too
is a very expensive place,

01:28:47.767 --> 01:28:53.584
these people are kept there. There they
will summarize everyone. Because when -

01:28:53.584 --> 01:29:01.568
My husband, you know, is in it and he
has even spoken to the head of WHO.

01:29:01.568 --> 01:29:07.656
So they said that there is no tabulation
for this, there should be some things
presented to show what was cured
and what did not.

01:29:07.656 --> 01:29:11.923
Now I don't write down about whom I
cured and what I did to whom, this is
a useless thing and is beyond My capacity.

01:29:11.923 --> 01:29:16.000
So I told these doctors that you
yourselves do the tabulation,
so they are doing it there.

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.258
Now if there are any such patients
here who are incurable, then they
can come and stay there.

01:29:20.258 --> 01:29:24.007
We can treat them. Such people
who can afford to come.

01:29:24.007 --> 01:29:31.340
Now there they have taken up four
subjects - Cancer and A.I.D.S. and

01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:34.685
which are very difficult subjects,
because they have more facilities there.

01:29:34.685 --> 01:29:39.706
So that is one of the things we are
doing, in which such patients whose
curability is not available here,

01:29:39.706 --> 01:29:45.330
they can stay there at very cheap
rates, they will be treated,
and they can be cured.

01:29:45.330 --> 01:29:49.004
So we are doing this work as well.
And here three doctors are doing this.

01:29:49.004 --> 01:29:52.807
After that, taking these doctors,
three doctors - then there is
also Doctor Saheb -

01:29:52.807 --> 01:29:57.645
together, we are thinking of setting up
such a facility in Delhi, or if you
say so, in Calcutta itself.

01:29:57.645 --> 01:30:03.364
Such an institution can be set up in
Calcutta only, where doctors can
treat people.

01:30:03.364 --> 01:30:07.661
Start such an institution here,
for incurable diseases to be treated.

01:30:07.661 --> 01:30:12.244
Now we have created these things
on three levels, you can understand,
cultural,

01:30:12.244 --> 01:30:20.140
educational, and one is this, and the
other is agriculture. And it is very big.

01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:22.469
Sahaja Yogi: The thing about the
incurable is absolutely correct,
that can be worked upon.

01:30:22.469 --> 01:30:26.897
Shri Mataji: Yeah, incurable, but the
thing is that, now like if you say,
we will send doctors to you from there.

01:30:26.897 --> 01:30:31.111
All the experts will come and work
hard for six months. They can
work hard, but if you say that

01:30:31.111 --> 01:30:35.706
they will give money, then no; They
will say, "Mother, we have to buy
the land now and we have to ourselves

01:30:35.706 --> 01:30:40.383
Those people don't have any of this
in it. It is this that, 'Mother, now'
and they don't even have that much money.

01:30:40.383 --> 01:30:42.142
Sahaja Yogi: No, we will have to
see the meeting point that how.

01:30:42.142 --> 01:30:47.317
Shri Mataji: Yes, the meeting point
is that they will come to your
Lion's Club, will help you.

01:30:47.317 --> 01:30:51.886
If you say, 'Cure people,' will do
the work for free, will do everything

01:30:52.084 --> 01:30:58.124
But the only thing is that they will
not pick up the money and give it,
because whatever, whatever little
money they have collected

01:30:58.124 --> 01:31:02.328
instead they would want that we - on
the contrary, we would expect you
people to give us money.

01:31:02.361 --> 01:31:07.651
Sahaja Yogi: Or else there is no
problem of required money anywhere.
There is no problem of required money.

01:31:07.999 --> 01:31:10.757
Sahaja Yogi: The land that is here in
Barasaat

01:31:10.757 --> 01:31:13.455
Shri Mataji: What are you saying?
Sahaja Yogi: The land that is here
in Barasaat of Sahaja Yoga

01:31:13.455 --> 01:31:18.847
Shri Mataji: Yes. Okay, his land
that is here, we are thinking
that Agro industries,

01:31:18.847 --> 01:31:25.637
I told him that we will start - Agro
industries. In our country there are
many things which get wasted,
so we should make them.

01:31:25.637 --> 01:31:30.254
Now he has come up with a very good
plan that they'll make juices.

01:31:30.254 --> 01:31:37.949
Now we can do Sahaja Yoga through
food also, for example, while making
juices and adding vibrated water to it.

01:31:37.949 --> 01:31:43.800
It goes into the stomach, likewise/thus
you people will become Sahaj Yogis.
This is a trick. No, there is no
harm in telling you.

01:31:43.800 --> 01:31:48.523
So we will make these kinds of
juices here. We are thinking
of building such a factory.

01:31:48.523 --> 01:31:53.550
In collaboration with that, we
have thought of setting up a
factory there in Maharashtra.

01:31:53.550 --> 01:31:58.247
Then besides this, we are thinking
that My boys are working very
hard on solar energy.

01:31:58.247 --> 01:32:02.794
The whole invention of solar energy
is being done. Now this is also
a very big thing

01:32:02.794 --> 01:32:06.516
We have so much solar energy, we
are working on knowing how to use it.

01:32:06.516 --> 01:32:10.921
Those people will come for solar energy.
And the third thing they -

01:32:11.177 --> 01:32:17.187
- yes, cheap fuel, cheap fuel from
bagasse etc. how to make cheap
fuel, from peanut shells, -

01:32:17.187 --> 01:32:21.536
working hard on cheap fuel. In this way
they have thought about many things.

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:26.561
Apart from this, we have formed an
institution there for the reform
of women [society].

01:32:26.561 --> 01:32:32.357
How women can cook food easily,
Maghan Chuhle, this and that -

01:32:32.357 --> 01:32:38.198
They have started a basic education
system on animal husbandry, meaning
they have a number of this here

01:32:38.198 --> 01:32:43.937
Now it will cost money. And we are
afraid of the government that if
we borrow anything from them,
a problem on our head.

01:32:44.271 --> 01:32:48.841
Sahaja Yogi: That is for sure.
Shri Mataji: Therefore whatever
we can do

01:32:48.841 --> 01:32:52.982
And for The Reserve Bank also, nothing
much, a committee has to be formed -
My brother himself is a chartered accountant

01:32:52.982 --> 01:32:57.837
So I told him, 'You form a committee,
and whatever is required in that
committee we will do that.'

01:32:57.837 --> 01:33:00.961
These people handle all the money,
I have no capacity for it.

01:33:00.961 --> 01:33:05.681
These people handle all the money,
I don't even touch it, I don't
even know what they do

01:33:05.681 --> 01:33:10.093
And my brother just does its this,
what is it called - what do they
call it? Audit.

01:33:10.093 --> 01:33:15.816
Audit, he just does the audit.
And sometimes scams also happen,

01:33:15.816 --> 01:33:22.937
Scam meaning, they don't take away
My money, but the thing is that,
didn't take permission from
Reserve Bank and started some work.

01:33:22.937 --> 01:33:25.429
I said, "What a trouble! You people
are going to put Me in jail."

01:33:25.429 --> 01:33:31.706
What happened at your place? Done?
What had happened? Huh?

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:35.909
Sahaja Yogi: Just something had happened.
Shri Mataji: Well! Is it alright? Okay.

01:33:36.505 --> 01:33:41.315
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, so if there are
some personal problems.
Shri Mataji: Okay, speak son.
[Please give me the fan]

01:33:44.967 --> 01:33:49.737
Seeker: Do You have any problem
at Your place? (UNCLEAR)
Shri Mataji: Yes, that's all there.

01:33:49.737 --> 01:33:52.321
Seeker: Can we get Your photo?
Shri Mataji: Okay, alright.

01:33:52.321 --> 01:33:54.996
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji they say
that money is not needed.

01:33:55.447 --> 01:34:00.247
Shri Mataji: Now spend money at Sahaja
Yoga level (UNCLEAR)

01:34:00.355 --> 01:34:06.655
Because see, I have no objection to
keeping the children in Calcutta.

01:34:06.869 --> 01:34:12.298
But firstly the climate here is not
so good for children and for health.

01:34:12.298 --> 01:34:16.853
Means we will build a Seconds school.
Secondly, I feel the water here
is very polluted.

01:34:16.853 --> 01:34:21.726
Now if the children are given amoebic
dysentery right from the start,
what will they be able do?

01:34:21.726 --> 01:34:29.404
So have thought that the climate of
Bombay is good, it's cool, it's a
good place, will start there.

01:34:29.518 --> 01:34:32.578
And after that if you say then
will start here too.

01:34:32.578 --> 01:34:37.479
But here, children should be kept
in a place where the water is good.

01:34:37.479 --> 01:34:42.993
Because where there is impurity in
the water, so the poor children -
we keep them close to us in our love,

01:34:42.993 --> 01:34:45.370
but this amoeba should be treated first.

01:34:45.370 --> 01:34:51.015
Till then it is possible that some
arrangement may be made at your place,
so that people do not suffer from
amoebic dysentery.

01:34:51.015 --> 01:34:54.326
Some such arrangement can be made by
then, if the attention goes there,

01:34:54.791 --> 01:35:03.391
so that the amoeba is eliminated and
a method is found so that children
do not suffer from amoebiasis.

01:35:03.467 --> 01:35:06.347
Because here I see that every
child has amoeba.

01:35:06.582 --> 01:35:09.380
Seeker: So then Mataji Your vibrated
water there (UNCLEAR)

01:35:09.380 --> 01:35:12.744
Shri Mataji: That is exactly what I
am saying. Put lots of vibrated
water everywhere here.

01:35:12.744 --> 01:35:18.081
Whatever vibrated water you can put,
take vibrated water to the Ganges
and pour it there.

01:35:18.081 --> 01:35:24.400
And poor thing what can it do, all
the people there leave the filth of
the world, all of it comes and
gets collected here.

01:35:24.995 --> 01:35:29.945
Seeker: Shri Mataji, of/for the schools
here, a lot of problems of primary
schools, the government is also

01:35:29.945 --> 01:35:33.533
Shri Mataji: You should do primary school.
Seeker: The government is also ready
to give free land.

01:35:33.781 --> 01:35:38.851
Shri Mataji: You should go for the
primary school. For the primary school
you should not make

01:35:39.561 --> 01:35:43.288
it in too much expensive way.
Make it in an open way.

01:35:43.288 --> 01:35:49.335
Seeker: Simplicity (UNCLEAR)
Shri Mataji: Yes, build more primary
schools with simplicity. There is
no harm in primary schools.

01:35:49.335 --> 01:35:54.870
But building a big school, one - it
will cost a lot and that age is such,

01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:58.721
the age of adolescence is such that
they, the children should keep separate.

01:35:58.721 --> 01:36:03.872
They should be kept away from their
parents, and apart from that, they
should be kept outside the city.

01:36:03.872 --> 01:36:07.535
Sahaja Yogi: Mataji should they be
kept outside the city? The school
should be such

01:36:07.535 --> 01:36:10.576
Shri Mataji: No, no, let the primary
school remain, there is no problem
in primary school

01:36:10.576 --> 01:36:15.734
Seeker: If we find a good place like
Safari Park, 8-10 acres, 15 acres
Seeker: Yes, build it in that

01:36:15.862 --> 01:36:21.072
Sahaja Yogi: Make it in this only.
There is a lake behind.

01:36:21.072 --> 01:36:25.853
Shri Mataji: They have a very nice
school running, Sahaj School in Delhi.

01:36:25.853 --> 01:36:32.345
But Primary school, Montessori Primary.
And they have a school there in
Pathankot, that too is like this.

01:36:32.345 --> 01:36:36.310
But now Pathankot is also a place
outside the city, please understand;
the people there...

01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:38.549
Sahaja Yogi: Will work on it after
the blue print from Bombay arrives?

01:36:38.549 --> 01:36:44.223
Shri Mataji: Yes. Let it be made, you
see how it is, and I will show you.

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:54.676
Woman: A lot of pain in my neck.
Shri Mataji: Where?

01:36:54.676 --> 01:36:59.495
Woman: At the back here and some part
of the spine.
Shri Mataji: In the whole spine?

01:36:59.495 --> 01:37:02.906
Woman: Yes, in the legs too.
Shri Mataji: Have you had an accident?

01:37:02.906 --> 01:37:08.773
Woman: No, nothing has happened.
Sahaja Yogi: It is more in the middle
of the third-fourth disc.

01:37:08.773 --> 01:37:11.622
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogi: There is more displacement
in between the third and fourth disc.

01:37:11.622 --> 01:37:21.696
Shri Mataji: She is in pain. Just keep
hand. Well, are you okay today?
Sahaja Yogi: Absolutely, Mataji.

01:37:21.696 --> 01:37:23.355
Shri Mataji: From everything?
Sahaja Yogi: I am feeling very light.

01:37:23.355 --> 01:37:26.032
Shri Mataji: Huh?
Sahaja Yogi: I am feeling very light
and floaty.

01:37:26.032 --> 01:37:30.405
Sahaja Yogi: Vibrations are flowing.
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji, should we
bring breakfast here?

01:37:30.405 --> 01:37:35.938
Shri Mataji: No, no, what breakfast
will I have now? Breakfast is done.
Now will have lunch.

01:37:38.425 --> 01:37:41.965
Later, later, will have lunch.
Let's talk to them now. Yes.

01:37:41.965 --> 01:37:45.576
Sahaja Yogi: Should we take another problem?
Shri Mataji: Yes. Put your hand.

01:37:48.261 --> 01:37:56.201
Whom do you believe in, Krishna? Do
you believe in Shri Krishna? Whom
do you believe in? Huh?

01:37:56.201 --> 01:37:59.655
Seeker: No, is there anything like
that about Lord Krishna?

01:37:59.655 --> 01:38:03.330
Seeker: I believe in Sai Baba.
Shri Mataji: Huh? Which one, the one from Shirdi?
Sahaja Yogi: Which Baba? The one from Shirdi?

01:38:03.330 --> 01:38:13.783
Oh, then, Sathya Sai Baba. Very
bad thing! Okay, say the
Mahishasura Mardini mantra.

01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:20.080
Woman: Mataji, it's going to be two
years, I have had 2-3 operations done.
Shri Mataji: For what?

01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:23.706
Woman: The pain in her stomach is
so severe that can't say anything.

01:38:23.749 --> 01:38:26.549
Shri Mataji: Where does it pain?

01:38:26.549 --> 01:38:29.358
Woman: Took her to Bombay and got all
the treatment done; here in Calcutta

01:38:29.358 --> 01:38:30.861
Shri Mataji: What did they treat?

01:38:30.861 --> 01:38:35.082
Woman: They first checked and said
that it is gall TB. It is gland TB.

01:38:35.082 --> 01:38:38.610
Removed the gland from this side. Then
they tested it and said there is nothing.

01:38:38.610 --> 01:38:42.842
Then removed the appendix, nothing was
found in the appendix either. Then after
that they said, no, it is fine now.

01:38:42.842 --> 01:38:46.883
Then after that came to Calcutta and
showed, got the treatment done but
still did not get complete relief.

01:38:46.883 --> 01:38:48.822
Shri Mataji: She has nothing, she
just has liver trouble.

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:52.948
I must say that even doctors lack
wisdom to such an extent, more
than necessary.

01:38:52.948 --> 01:39:04.095
Come here in front. Come forward.
Bring vibrated sugar. Doctor sahab
will tell you the regular treatment
for this liver.

01:39:04.095 --> 01:39:07.894
It's the limit. It is an obvious
case. How will they understand?

01:39:07.894 --> 01:39:13.363
Doctors can never diagnose liver
disease until cirrhosis occurs.

01:39:13.625 --> 01:39:17.415
Sorry, the doctors must be sitting
here - please forgive Me.

01:39:17.415 --> 01:39:24.228
Sahaja Yogis: There are not many.
There is only Dr. Talwar.
Sarkar sahab is also there.

01:39:26.138 --> 01:39:30.572
Shri Mataji: If the area is of the
liver, then why doubt it. Come on,
give some to her.

01:39:30.752 --> 01:39:42.482
Eat it, come on eat it. Give her
sugar candy and cardamom - eat it
- and vibrate the sugar

01:39:42.482 --> 01:39:57.057
give that, give kokum to drink.
Yes, are you enjoying it? Come
forward, come forward.

01:39:59.762 --> 01:40:10.442
It's clearly the liver sir. Everything
forward, I don't understand what kind of
intelligence these doctors have?

01:40:10.442 --> 01:40:13.974
When the area is of the liver then
why are you removing the appendix?

01:40:15.076 --> 01:40:19.236
Woman: There is a lady from my place,
she was tested, her appendix is
being removed.

01:40:19.236 --> 01:40:23.851
Shri Mataji: The only work they do
is of removing - removal experts.

01:40:25.982 --> 01:40:29.402
Well, this is not any disease,
tell Me more?

01:40:29.402 --> 01:40:33.048
Woman: You see, these two glands
of mine are also hurting a lot.

01:40:33.048 --> 01:40:36.273
Shri Mataji: Now with you Marwari
people, I don't have any one also

01:40:37.946 --> 01:40:41.976
that you people have become such
vegetarians that what should I say now?

01:40:41.976 --> 01:40:45.782
Now at least you people eat protein.
See, we have muscles.

01:40:45.816 --> 01:40:51.796
Now if you don't give any food to
these muscles, won't they become
weak? It's a simple thing.

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:57.300
Did you understand? These don't understand
that you are a vegetarian and that's
why you are not giving them food.

01:40:57.526 --> 01:41:03.356
Start eating some protein of any
kind. Sattu is a very good thing.

01:41:03.356 --> 01:41:11.656
You should eat sattu. Sattu has
strength in it. And apart from that,
among protein food you have soyabean.

01:41:11.853 --> 01:41:17.313
Now just develop taste for it. Firstly,
on one side we are vegetarians and on
the other side very particular about taste.

01:41:18.813 --> 01:41:26.123
Isn't it? So this is what you have
to say between the two scissors. Now
you have to eat protein as a medicine.

01:41:26.123 --> 01:41:33.952
Leave rice and flat bread. Leaving
it completely, then you will
feel fine. Eat protein.

01:41:33.952 --> 01:41:38.607
By the way, I have given you kerosene
oil and the things that grow
inside the ground

01:41:38.607 --> 01:41:42.958
like potatoes, radishes, don't
eat all these.

01:41:46.257 --> 01:41:51.137
Woman: One, I go every day in
Sahaja Yoga and try but I still
don’t have any experience.

01:41:51.417 --> 01:41:55.397
I go daily - all this illness and also
(UNCLEAR)

01:41:55.397 --> 01:41:59.032
Shri Mataji: There are many other
problems too. Give her realization.

01:41:59.962 --> 01:42:05.712
Sahaja Yogi: You go there, go behind.
Go to the back, you'll get the realization.

01:42:12.358 --> 01:42:18.848
Shri Mataji: Is it cooling down?
Just put ice on her stomach,
on that place. On the liver.

01:42:19.101 --> 01:42:26.841
Yes tell Me son, tell Me what?
Yes what? Tell Me quickly.
Sahaja Yogi: Acute Asthma –
Bronchitis and Asthma

01:42:26.841 --> 01:42:30.981
Shri Mataji: Whom?
Sahaja Yogi: Pramod come. Bring your bill.

01:42:38.806 --> 01:42:43.536
Sahaja Yogi: Suppose he gets up early
in the morning, normally as we
get up at 5-6 a.m.,

01:42:43.536 --> 01:42:48.049
if he wakes up early, it becomes difficult
for him to get through the day.

01:42:48.049 --> 01:42:52.884
Can't get up before 7-8 o'clock, cannot
leave the bed. His condition is acute.

01:42:52.884 --> 01:42:56.319
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogi: Breathing, asthma and bronchitis.

01:42:56.319 --> 01:43:01.561
Shri Mataji: Who is your father? Huh?
Sahaja Yogi: Shyam Lal Ji Bhagat.

01:43:01.561 --> 01:43:05.585
Shri Mataji: Shyam Lal ji Bhagat.
Sahaja Yogi: Deals in sugar.

01:43:05.585 --> 01:43:11.328
Shri Mataji: Deals in sugar. Is
your relationship with father okay?

01:43:11.620 --> 01:43:14.000
Sahaja Yogi: It is very good.
Shri Mataji: It is very, very good.

01:43:14.000 --> 01:43:22.001
Sahaja Yogi: It is very good. He has
four sons. He relies the most in him.

01:43:23.595 --> 01:43:26.555
Shri Mataji: And has anyone in
your family had it?

01:43:27.374 --> 01:43:32.894
Seeker: My grandmother. Father also
had it earlier, but not so much now.

01:43:37.660 --> 01:43:50.770
Shri Mataji: Okay, what is father's age?
Are you feeling good? It is alright,
you may go.

01:43:50.770 --> 01:44:03.143
Rub here. Massage here with your hand.
This right hand, here. You come here.

01:44:05.154 --> 01:44:07.524
Sahaja yogi: Shift back a little.

01:44:20.435 --> 01:44:27.645
Shri Mataji: Now keep your right
hand towards Me. Okay, and keep
your left hand like this.

01:44:29.232 --> 01:44:34.342
Did you feel any coolness? Did you
feel coolness in your hands? Didn't get?

01:44:34.342 --> 01:44:43.625
Hasn't got realization yet. Then,
give realization. Whom should I
tell? Come on, you take.

01:44:45.535 --> 01:44:49.175
Sahaja Yogi: There're some Sahaja Yogis
Shri Mataji: You must work yourself.

01:44:49.175 --> 01:44:55.856
All people from Calcutta - you are
a Sahaja yogi? - not, you're not, annh?

01:44:55.856 --> 01:45:01.826
Sahaja Yogi: Hasn't got yet(realization).
Shri Mataji: Hasn't got yet? Sit like
this. All those who are not realized,
sit like this so that don't get diseases.

01:45:01.826 --> 01:45:07.603
Sahaja Yogi: Get it done by the people
from Calcutta. These will go to Bombay,
Mataji. Get it corrected by the people
from Calcutta.

01:45:07.603 --> 01:45:11.511
Shri Mataji: This only is the correct
thing. You people use all imported goods.

01:45:12.247 --> 01:45:19.197
Everything is imported. Now I have
to export everyone from Calcutta
to America, Germany

01:45:19.449 --> 01:45:23.839
My hands hurt there.
I have to send you all there.

01:45:27.468 --> 01:45:32.188
Well, one thing is compulsory in Sahaja
Yoga, that everyone has to wear a vest.

01:45:32.188 --> 01:45:34.773
Just one thing, everyone just wear a vest.

01:45:36.005 --> 01:45:40.155
Sahaja Yogi: Well Mataji, for him, when
he wears this vest, he sweats a lot,

01:45:40.155 --> 01:45:45.287
sweating takes place, and if the
vest stays wet, then it's even more.

01:45:47.344 --> 01:45:50.894
Otherwise, the day You told in Your
lecture, since then he is wearing.

01:45:51.174 --> 01:45:55.058
Shri Mataji: Okay, you do your
left hand like this. Yes, what?

01:45:55.058 --> 01:46:00.128
Sahaja Yogi: Right Swadhisthana,
Left Heart.

01:46:02.134 --> 01:46:05.854
Shri Mataji: So what do you do
in the sugar factory?

01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:09.840
Seeker: Nothing, the trading side.
Shri Mataji: There are even more
problems with trading.

01:46:10.283 --> 01:46:24.023
It takes a lot of hard work,
doesn't it, have to think a lot. Yes!
Sahaja Yogi: Left nabhi, left nabhi.

01:46:24.571 --> 01:46:28.901
Shri Mataji: Now you put your other
hand towards Me, keep your right
hand on the ground.

01:46:28.975 --> 01:46:36.475
You close your eyes and tell your
grandmother that, "I am fine now,"

01:46:36.475 --> 01:46:43.187
"You stop worrying about me, you
take birth again and give
yourself realisation."

01:46:43.187 --> 01:46:46.418
First his realisation must work out
then will things get better.

01:46:46.555 --> 01:46:53.775
Say it three times. This triggering
happens; In the first place vulnerability
should be there.

01:46:53.775 --> 01:47:02.717
Very hard- working man, very sort of a
person who is futuristic, right sided
person becomes

01:47:02.717 --> 01:47:06.387
If someone becomes very right sided,
then there is heat within him.

01:47:06.387 --> 01:47:12.464
Because of that heat, his lungs
start drying up a bit. Lung
starts drying up

01:47:12.464 --> 01:47:17.190
meaning, its epithelial cells, they shrink.

01:47:17.190 --> 01:47:24.074
Because of that he has become vulnerable
now. He will have cold, cold, those
who suffer frequently from common cold.

01:47:24.074 --> 01:47:26.274
Sahaja Yogi: It's absolutely of
severe bronchitis type

01:47:26.274 --> 01:47:31.740
Shri Mataji: So what you do is take
some ice and put it on his liver -
are you okay now? Now go.

01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:38.993
You put ice on his liver, here on the
liver. If you keep it there on the
liver daily, his liver will cool down.

01:47:38.993 --> 01:47:47.792
But asthma occurs in it when there is
triggering from the left side. Like his
grandmother, when she died she's caught him.

01:47:47.792 --> 01:47:57.589
Son, say to grandmother. Are they
coming now? See?

01:47:58.235 --> 01:48:02.115
Say to grandmother again. Bring
a lemon, lemon.

01:48:08.748 --> 01:48:13.718
Sahaja Yogi: Should we take-up another case?
Shri Mataji: Hmm. What happened?

01:48:13.718 --> 01:48:15.682
Woman: He stammers while speaking.
Shri Mataji: What?

01:48:15.682 --> 01:48:19.575
Woman: While speaking he keeps stammering.
Shri Mataji: Ok! It happens through Vishuddhi.

01:48:19.575 --> 01:48:23.930
Is there anyone who can put his
hand on Vishuddhi? Come on you people.
Someone please send him.

01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:29.970
What son? I don't eat any of
these things. Huh?

01:48:29.970 --> 01:48:33.450
Sahaja Yogis: You have not eaten
anything since morning.
Shri Mataji: No, no.

01:48:33.450 --> 01:48:36.851
Shri Mataji: I didn't have?
Sahaja Yogis: Haven't eaten
anything since morning.

01:48:36.851 --> 01:48:42.590
Shri Mataji: So come on, eating now.
I have eaten?
Sahaja Yogi: Didn't eat.

01:48:43.002 --> 01:48:48.742
Sahaja Yogi: Take whatever You wish to.
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no, oh, not him,
he is just saying it like that. I have eaten.

01:48:48.742 --> 01:48:52.583
Sahaja Yogi: No, Shri Mataji.
Shri Mataji: I ate. I ate some of the kadaa.

01:48:58.745 --> 01:49:14.645
Now say? Did it come? Did you say it
again? Say it again three times. Whom
do you believe in? In Hanumanji.

01:49:15.462 --> 01:49:23.852
Problem is from that. Hanumanji
has caught you only. Okay,
you move to this side.

01:49:23.976 --> 01:49:30.796
Ok son, you ask Me a question,
"Mother, are You Hanumanji?" Yes,
keep your left hand like this.

01:49:32.238 --> 01:49:35.138
Woman: Mother, are You Hanumanji?
Shri Mataji: Ask again.

01:49:35.138 --> 01:49:38.291
'Mother, are You Hanumanji?' Keep it
on right, right Vishuddhi. Yes!

01:49:38.291 --> 01:49:40.478
Woman: Mother, are You Hanumanji?
Shri Mataji: Ask again.

01:49:40.478 --> 01:49:43.418
Woman: Mother, are You Hanumanji?
Shri Mataji: Ask again.

01:49:43.418 --> 01:49:46.501
Woman: Mother, are You Hanumanji?
Shri Mataji: Ask again.

01:49:46.501 --> 01:49:49.982
Woman: Mother, are You Hanumanji?
Shri Mataji: Ask again.

01:49:49.982 --> 01:50:00.777
Woman: Mother, are You Hanumanji?
Shri Mataji: Feeling cool in your hands?

01:50:01.378 --> 01:50:08.388
Now say, 'You are' 'Mataji, You are Hanumanji.'
Woman: Mataji, You are Hanumanji.

01:50:08.388 --> 01:50:11.268
Shri Mataji: Say it again.
Woman: Mataji You are Hanumanji.

01:50:11.287 --> 01:50:14.427
Shri Mataji: Say it again.
Woman: Mataji You are Hanumanji.

01:50:14.427 --> 01:50:18.077
Shri Mataji: Okay, now you have
started speaking properly, right?
Hanuman, now say, Hanuman.

01:50:18.077 --> 01:50:32.161
Woman: Hanuman.
Shri Mataji: Is it coming on your
hand? Now both hands. Is it coming?

01:50:39.917 --> 01:50:47.197
Now you can make her say anything.
(UNCLEAR) You are alright, come on.
You also say the same. Hmm!

01:50:47.357 --> 01:50:53.027
Woman: I have more pain in this leg.
Shri Mataji: He only is catching
on the right side. Yes, keep it on
the right.

01:50:53.545 --> 01:50:57.075
Now say, 'Mother are You Hanumanji?'
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:50:57.176 --> 01:50:59.486
Shri Mataji: Yes
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:50:59.486 --> 01:51:01.437
Shri Mataji: Yes
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:51:01.437 --> 01:51:03.738
Shri Mataji: Hmm
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:51:03.738 --> 01:51:05.861
Shri Mataji: Hmm
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:51:05.861 --> 01:51:08.068
Shri Mataji: Hmm
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:51:08.068 --> 01:51:10.343
Shri Mataji: Yes
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:51:10.343 --> 01:51:12.835
Shri Mataji: Yes
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:51:12.835 --> 01:51:15.023
Shri Mataji: Hmm
Woman: Mother are You Hanumanji?

01:51:15.023 --> 01:51:20.893
Shri Mataji: Did it come? You got
the answer, right?
Now say, 'You are Hanumanji.'

01:51:20.893 --> 01:51:26.303
Woman: You are Hanumanji.
Shri Mataji: 'Shri Mataji You are Hanumanji.'
Woman: Shri Mataji You are Hanumanji.

01:51:26.303 --> 01:51:28.657
Shri Mataji: Yes!
Woman: Shri Mataji You are Hanumanji.

01:51:28.657 --> 01:51:31.399
Shri Mataji: Hmm!
Woman: Shri Mataji You are Hanumanji.

01:51:31.399 --> 01:51:33.850
Woman: Shri Mataji You are Hanumanji.

01:51:33.850 --> 01:51:40.131
Shri Mataji: Now look, look at the
leg. Is there pain? Please lift it.
Get up, get up, then you will know.

01:51:40.131 --> 01:51:46.255
Got up comfortably? Yes.
Woman: There is no pain in
getting up, it is only here.

01:51:46.255 --> 01:51:50.230
Shri Mataji: Where? Is it there now?
Yes. For this you should wear
high heel shoes, a little high.

01:51:50.230 --> 01:51:54.878
Not touching the ground like this,
okay! Wear a little high heel
shoes and you will be fine.

01:51:54.878 --> 01:52:03.758
You are a little overweight also,
that's why. So by wearing heels, won't
have. Okay. What is your problem?

01:52:03.758 --> 01:52:05.451
Seeker: Sugar.
Shri Mataji: Hmm?

01:52:05.451 --> 01:52:08.671
Seeker: Sugar(Diabetes).
Shri Mataji: Have sugar. Well,
you think too much.

01:52:08.671 --> 01:52:11.058
What do you do?
Seeker: Textile.

01:52:11.058 --> 01:52:12.491
Shri Mataji: What?
Seeker: Textile

01:52:12.491 --> 01:52:14.891
Shri Mataji: What do you do in textiles?
Seeker: We do manufacturing.

01:52:14.891 --> 01:52:16.811
Shri Mataji: What?
Seeker: We do manufacturing and export.

01:52:16.811 --> 01:52:28.570
Shri Mataji: Of textiles? Well for this,
right hand - you will have to become
somewhat a Muslim

01:52:28.570 --> 01:52:39.088
Okay, keep this hand. You ask,
"Mother, are You Hazrat Ali
and Fatima?" Ask.

01:52:39.088 --> 01:52:47.644
Seeker: Mother are You Hazrat Ali
and Fatima?
Shri Mataji: Ask again. Open your
eyes and look at The feet. Yes.

01:52:47.644 --> 01:52:51.117
Seeker: Mother are You Hazrat Ali
and Fatima?
Shri Mataji: Yes, say again.

01:52:51.117 --> 01:52:55.194

and Fatima? Mother are You Hazrat Ali
and Fatima?

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:04.340
Seeker: Mother are You Hazrat Ali
and Fatima?
Shri Mataji: Are you feeling coolness
in your hands now?

01:53:05.051 --> 01:53:14.091
Now say, 'You are'. Yes! You are
Hazrat Ali and Fatima.

01:53:14.091 --> 01:53:16.539
Seeker: You are Hazrat Ali and Fatima.
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:53:16.564 --> 01:53:19.634
Seeker: You are Hazrat Ali and Fatima.
Shri Mataji: Hmm.

01:53:19.634 --> 01:53:23.232
Seeker: You are Hazrat Ali and Fatima.
Shri Mataji: Hmm, say.

01:53:23.232 --> 01:53:25.427
Seeker: You are Hazrat Ali and Fatima.
Shri Mataji: Hmm.

01:53:25.427 --> 01:53:28.252
Seeker: You are Hazrat Ali and Fatima.
Shri Mataji: Hmm.

01:53:28.252 --> 01:53:33.955
Feeling coolness in your hands, right?
You are getting it, because your
fingers have become shiny, son.

01:53:33.955 --> 01:53:41.488
Look? See it is coming above his head.
Sahaja Yogi: It is coming.

01:53:41.488 --> 01:53:49.128
Shri Mataji: Yes? Has come.
Sahaja yogi: Unnh, he's got a big lump here.

01:53:49.128 --> 01:53:51.470
Shri Mataji: Huh? On Vishuddhi.
Do you smoke a cigarette?

01:53:51.470 --> 01:53:55.061
Sahaja Yogi: Do you say mantras etc?
Do you chant mantras?

01:53:55.070 --> 01:54:00.750
Shri Mataji: Which mantra?
Seeker: Om Namah Shivay.

01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:03.891
Sahaja Yogi: See in front and say it.
Look at Mataji's Bindi.

01:54:03.891 --> 01:54:06.525
Shri Mataji: Hmm, say. I am Shiva.
Yes! Yes.

01:54:06.525 --> 01:54:08.265
Sahaja Yogi: Look up and say it.
Shri Mataji: Yes, hmm

01:54:08.265 --> 01:54:14.113
Seeker: Om Namah Shivay, Om Namah Shivay,
Om Namah Shivay, Om Namah Shivay,
Om Namah Shivay, Om Namah Shivay

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:18.945
Shri Mataji: Did it come in your hand?
Sahaja Yogi: Some left nabhi is there.

01:54:21.023 --> 01:54:28.857
Shri Mataji: Right Swadhisthana,
left nabhi. Wife, your wife?

01:54:30.307 --> 01:54:33.997
Seeker: She was here just now.
With the little girl.

01:54:34.407 --> 01:54:39.685
Sahaja Yogis: One with whom...she's
at the back.
Shri Mataji: She's the one who
believes in Hanumanji.

01:54:39.685 --> 01:54:47.361
Sahaja Yogis: No, Shri Mataji.
no, no, earlier..
Shri Mataji: Well, you are, you.
Whom do you believe in?

01:54:47.756 --> 01:54:54.746
Woman: Believe in Radha Krishna.
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Vishnu. Shri
Radha Krishna, Radha Krishna?

01:54:56.446 --> 01:55:02.556
Shri Mataji: Who does she believe in?
Sahaja Yogi: She is saying that she
believes in Radha Krishna, Bhagwati

01:55:02.656 --> 01:55:11.056
Shri Mataji: You believe in Bhagvati?
Then what else is needed to believe,
everything is contained in Bhagwati. Look.

01:55:14.510 --> 01:55:18.420
Sahaja Yogi: What are these rings
you are wearing?
Shri Mataji: Remove the rings, yes.

01:55:18.420 --> 01:55:22.841
These boys know it all; They have
to die(suffer) every day in this.

01:55:22.841 --> 01:55:27.881
They are asking them, 'Did you chant
mantras? Why are you wearing a ring?
What do you wear around your neck?'

01:55:27.881 --> 01:55:37.873
The poor people do this every day.
I don't touch anyone these days.
Yes! Now? Ekadasha

01:55:43.414 --> 01:55:48.834
For a while, let him put his right
hand towards Me and left hand this
side - it's done - sit here.

01:55:48.834 --> 01:55:54.686
Your problem will be removed now;
Put the rings in your pocket.
Come, sit down.

01:55:55.471 --> 01:56:02.271
Tell Me what is your problem now?
Now tell Me that your Lion and
Lioness are wounded like this,

01:56:02.271 --> 01:56:08.027
so what are you going to do? What
will the wounded Lion and Lioness
be able to do?

01:56:08.027 --> 01:56:12.052
Seeker: No, I'm telling You something
Mataji, that despite being so wounded,
they are doing so much work.

01:56:12.517 --> 01:56:16.467
Shri Mataji: But, but Mother would
want to heal their wounds.

01:56:16.467 --> 01:56:18.290
Seeker: Yes, that is what I'm saying.
If you make them alright, maybe
the work done will be double.

01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:20.003
Shri Mataji: Yes, I will definitely
make them alright. Yes!

01:56:20.003 --> 01:56:23.168
Woman: There is sensation in the hands,
there is sensation in the legs.
Shri Mataji: There is sensation?

01:56:23.168 --> 01:56:26.972
Woman: The sensation is so intense
that continuous (UNCLEAR).

01:56:26.972 --> 01:56:30.092
Shri Mataji: With what, do you bathe
with hot water a lot? Cold water.

01:56:33.444 --> 01:56:37.994
Who will come here? Come on,
come on, you also use your hands.

01:56:38.207 --> 01:56:47.207
Give bandhan, give bandhan; Come after
taking bandhan. Give yourself bandhan.

01:56:54.195 --> 01:57:00.505
Who all are sick, just raise
your hands. You, you.

01:57:01.720 --> 01:57:05.420
Come on, someone, someone or the
other attend them, just see which
Chakras are catching. [MARATHI]

01:57:05.420 --> 01:57:10.992
Sahaja Yogi: He has migraine
because of stress.
Shri Mataji: Migraine. Oh, that
is very easy to get cured.

01:57:10.992 --> 01:57:12.803
Sahaja Yogi: He's getting troubled/worried.
Seeker: If Your Grace is there
then I'll be alright.

01:57:12.803 --> 01:57:14.928
Shri Mataji: Yes, absolutely, absolutely.
Come on, get some ghee, okay

01:57:14.928 --> 01:57:18.611
Sahaja Yogi: He is a chartered accountant,
gold medalist.
Shri Mataji: Okay! That is why it is
happening to you.

01:57:21.447 --> 01:57:32.618
My brothers also have it. Ask him to
bring some ghee. Heat it and instill
it in his nose.

01:57:32.618 --> 01:57:39.458
I will vibrate it right now. I
will vibrate it. Just bring some
ghee and I will vibrate it.

01:57:39.458 --> 01:57:48.202
Seeker: He has blood pressure.
Shri Mataji: Has blood pressure?
Okay! Has it now?

01:57:48.202 --> 01:57:54.709
Coolness is coming, right? Not coming?
Left to the right. You move left
to the right.

01:57:54.709 --> 01:58:04.387
Come on, you move. No, no, left - lift
from the left. Tell, tell how. No,
he will tell, like this.

01:58:04.603 --> 01:58:11.763
Sahaja Yogis: It's from the left
only and is lifted from below. Hey,
below means right there - it's the same

01:58:16.200 --> 01:58:19.852
Shri Mataji: How is he doing now?
What's it, where are you catching?

01:58:19.852 --> 01:58:24.414
Sahaja Yogi: Mataji the left Swadhisthana
is too much, heart (UNCLEAR).

01:58:24.414 --> 01:58:28.118
Shri Mataji: Tell me clearly, which
Guru did you go to?

01:58:28.927 --> 01:58:31.287
Shri Mataji: What?
Seeker: Not to any Guru.

01:58:31.287 --> 01:58:36.150
Shri Mataji: No, well, but some
fake guru? Huh?

01:58:36.150 --> 01:58:38.570
Seeker: I believe in Hanumanji.
Shri Mataji: Whose?

01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:42.570
Sahaja Yogi: There is a photo of Hanumanji.
Shri Mataji: Okay, please take off
Hanumanji for a minute.

01:58:42.662 --> 01:58:48.912
Just go to Hanumanji's temple. The
panditji sitting there would be
applying a mark on your forehead.

01:58:50.682 --> 01:58:57.282
Do you understand you should not have
any mark put by him. Ok, keep your
right hand, right hand, do the
left hand, like this.

01:58:57.443 --> 01:59:04.763
Like this. Now say, 'Mother are
You Shri Hanumanji?'
Seeker: Mother are You Shri Hanumanji?

01:59:04.763 --> 01:59:16.490
Shri Mataji: Again, again, again,
again, again. Yes!

01:59:24.650 --> 01:59:28.460
Now tell Me, is it coming?

01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:36.958
Look at The Feet. Yes, say,
"Mother, are You Shri Hanumanji?"
Do left to the right.

01:59:38.522 --> 01:59:44.532
Yes, how are you? Now we can know
the Blood Pressure only after checking
it. Did coolness come in your hands?

01:59:48.983 --> 01:59:53.273
The musicians you brought
were completely cool.

01:59:59.841 --> 02:00:04.621
Sahaja Yogi: Was out, he was out.
Shri Mataji: He definitely got it.

02:00:05.620 --> 02:00:10.922
He is a devotee of the Goddess. Although
he is Jain but a devotee of the Goddess.
Sahaja Yogi: Though he is a devotee of
the Goddess, but he is not an orthodox.

02:00:10.922 --> 02:00:14.120
Shri Mataji: Is not orthodox.
Seeker: No, he mixes mostly amongst us.

02:00:14.120 --> 02:00:15.392
Shri Mataji: What?
Seeker: He is one with us.

02:00:15.392 --> 02:00:20.481
Shri Mataji: Absolutely. He does
not have that, meaning he believes
in the Goddess.

02:00:20.481 --> 02:00:24.502
Seeker: He was a Leo. Earlier he
was a  Leo.
Shri Mataji: Huh?

02:00:24.502 --> 02:00:27.404
Seeker: Earlier he was in our
youth club.
Shri Mataji: I see.

02:00:27.404 --> 02:00:30.170
Sahaja Yogi: We have a youth club
for this, it is called Leo.
Shri Mataji: Okay, okay, okay.

02:00:30.170 --> 02:00:31.531
Sahaja Yogi: Earlier he was in it.
Shri Mataji: Okay, okay.

02:00:33.121 --> 02:00:41.456
Shri Mataji: Yes, what's it?
Sahaja Yogi: She has got [UNCLEAR] Vishuddhi

02:00:41.456 --> 02:00:44.310
Shri Mataji: Right? Right Swadhishthan?
Both?

02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:52.863
Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR] Feels that
she's not sleeping [UNCLEAR]

02:00:53.033 --> 02:00:55.563
Sahaja Yogi: There is a lot of anger too.
Mother, please reduce that too.

02:00:55.563 --> 02:00:59.106
Shri Mataji: There is a lot of right
side, that's why. Right side is too much.

02:01:00.201 --> 02:01:03.160
How are you? Are you feeling any
coolness in your hands?
Seeker: I am not getting any.

02:01:03.160 --> 02:01:10.940
Shri Mataji: Should come, should come.
Just forgive everyone. Forgive,
forgive everyone. Sir, please forgive.

02:01:10.210 --> 02:01:18.420
Forgive; Just see what heat is there
in your hands! It's very hot, forgive,
forgive, forgive. Ice, get some ice.

02:01:20.783 --> 02:01:25.883
How is he?
Sahaj yogi: [UNCLEAR] heart is

02:01:25.883 --> 02:01:33.959
Shri Mataji: Yes! Okay, this hand,
keep these hand on the heart, keep
this hand towards Me, and say that,

02:01:33.959 --> 02:01:38.723
“Mother are you Shiva?” Hmm,
ask again.

02:01:56.897 --> 02:02:03.587
Yes, it's gone. By giving bandhan to
one's own heart, one can free him.

02:02:03.718 --> 02:02:13.868
Yes! You have come? Now see where it
is. Have you got anything? Slight,
slightly it's coming. It's coming.

02:02:13.868 --> 02:02:22.034
Now say, "Mother you are Shiva Himself." You
son? (UNCLEAR) Heart is catching very much.

02:02:24.347 --> 02:02:27.447
Sahaja Yogini: His whole right hand is
[UNCLEAR]
Shri Mataji: Whole?

02:02:27.447 --> 02:02:32.191
Sahaja Yogini: Yes, Swadhisthana,
nabhi, heart.
Shri Mataji: Okay, then do it from
left to right.

02:02:32.204 --> 02:02:39.214
Are you also a devotee of Hanuman?
Whose devotee are you?
Sahaja Yogini: Mahavira, Mahavira
Sahaja Yogi: Mahavir Swami ji.

02:02:39.214 --> 02:02:46.309
Shri Mataji: Of Mahavirji? Well, then
ask The question.
Sahaja Yogi: Mataji, are You Shri
Mahavira Himself? Ask.

02:02:46.309 --> 02:02:55.305
Shri Mataji: Give Me your left hand
and put it on the liver. Yes,
how are you now?

02:03:05.124 --> 02:03:10.414
Say that, 'If I have committed a
mistake, then Lord Shiva please
forgive me.'

02:03:13.613 --> 02:03:27.913
Say it three times. Yes! It's coming now.
Are you feeling the cool?

02:03:27.913 --> 02:03:30.516
Seeker: It's not coming in my hands.
Shri Mataji: Not coming?

02:03:32.592 --> 02:03:46.572
Not coming at all? How is he?
Sahaja Yogi: The left is completely
caught up. The left nabhi is very much

02:03:46.572 --> 02:03:50.261
Shri Mataji: He is possessed. Whom
did he go, to Sathya Sai Baba?

02:03:51.267 --> 02:03:57.017
He's possessed. Well, get seven lemons
and seven chillies for him.

02:03:57.017 --> 02:04:01.797
Sahaja Yogi: Seven lemons, seven chillies.
Shri Mataji: Not an easy task.

02:04:04.498 --> 02:04:19.688
Now speak. Say, 'Please forgive me.'
(UNCLEAR) Huh? Now look on the head.

02:04:19.688 --> 02:04:25.589
Sahaj Yogi: Guptaji tell to bring
seven lemons and seven chillies
Sahaj Yogi: Seven lemons and seven chillies

02:04:25.703 --> 02:04:28.083
Shri Mataji: Yes, in a mud pot.
Sahaja Yogi: In a mud pot.

02:04:28.105 --> 02:04:31.455
Shri Mataji: And its lid.
Sahaja Yogi: Needs a lid with it.

02:04:31.455 --> 02:04:41.557
Shri Mataji: Are you alright now?
Is it coming? Yes! It's alright.

02:04:53.162 --> 02:04:56.722
Come on. You are fine now.

02:04:56.722 --> 02:05:03.417
Is it done? Ok, now put your hand
on your head and see if it's coming
or not. Lift it up a little.

02:05:03.417 --> 02:05:07.308
Keep this hand. Put that hand towards Me.

02:05:13.453 --> 02:05:16.703
Have you never gone to any Tantrik?

02:05:17.462 --> 02:05:21.962
You don't have to go to Hanumanji's
temple and get the mark(tilak)
applied by any Brahmin.

02:05:21.962 --> 02:05:28.634
They're very wicked, all demons sitting
there in front of God. Okay, they
catch the Agnya. Now you're all right.

02:05:29.224 --> 02:05:35.404
Come on son, what, it's not working
for you right now? Well, at least
someone come here and see him.

02:05:41.491 --> 02:05:48.131
Well, did you settle the accounts?
Tell him, just see what are the
accounts for his saree.

02:05:50.401 --> 02:05:55.956
Hmm! Ask someone to settle the
accounts of the saree. Tell
this to your wife.

02:06:02.097 --> 02:06:07.427
Or let's go to the bank then, otherwise
I have all those traveller's cheques.
No, no, no, you don't do all that.

02:06:07.633 --> 02:06:16.493
No, nothing doing, nothing doing.
I am not going to take anything
from anyone. Don't do all this.

02:06:19.365 --> 02:06:24.125
What is this?
Sahaja Yogi: It's ghee for him - migraine
Shri Mataji: It's ghee, come on.

02:06:26.355 --> 02:06:31.805
The lady who was sitting here, if
camphor is lit in front of her,
might improve.

02:06:31.894 --> 02:06:34.964
Sahaja Yogi: He is suffering from migraine.
Shri Mataji: They run away with camphor.

02:06:35.562 --> 02:06:39.972
Sahaja Yogi: Camphor or vibrated ghee?
Shri Mataji: Camphor. What's yours son?

02:06:40.348 --> 02:06:45.468
Seeker: My right eye suddenly turns
red and there is a lot of pain.

02:06:45.517 --> 02:06:51.297
And it's there for the past four
years. Have shown to the topmost
doctors of India.

02:06:51.297 --> 02:06:56.376
They say it's some allergy and since
four years I have been continuously
instilling medicine morning and evening.

02:06:56.376 --> 02:07:00.448
If I stop medicine for a day, or the
eyes are exposed to excessive wind,
they will turn completely blood red.

02:07:00.448 --> 02:07:06.049
The black pupils in the centre are
also not visible. Well, I have
diabetes too, but very slight.

02:07:06.271 --> 02:07:10.311
Shri Mataji: Meaning that it's not right.
Something should be done.

02:07:10.311 --> 02:07:14.964
Who is doing this? Tell him to say
the mantra of Mahishasura Mardini too.

02:07:15.207 --> 02:07:25.487
Just see if there's a towel here,
a handkerchief; I had My handkerchief
with Me just now. I had it just now -
this one is very big, that was small.

02:07:26.216 --> 02:07:30.676
Woman: I have been suffering from back
and leg pain for many years, in my
knees, legs and back.

02:07:30.676 --> 02:07:36.729
Shri Mataji: Now you are also a
vegetarian, right? Do you bathe
in hot water? Bathe in cold water.

02:07:36.729 --> 02:07:41.620
And you will have to start eating some
protein, any kind of protein, okay?

02:07:41.620 --> 02:07:47.255
We are so vegetarian but we do not
pay attention whether there is
balance in it or not.

02:07:49.270 --> 02:07:55.050
Where has Arun Kumar gone? What's
the matter? I am looking for him.

02:07:56.458 --> 02:07:59.498
Sahaja yogi: Shri Mataji he's got the
left sided problem.
Shri Mataji: Annh?

02:07:59.498 --> 02:08:04.859
Sahaj Yogi: Left Swadhishthan,
Vishuddhi is very bad, nabhi, left nabhi
is also bad and Agnya is there.

02:08:04.859 --> 02:08:07.209
Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR] all these
Sahaja Yogi: All these

02:08:07.825 --> 02:08:13.145
Shri Mataji: Ok! Now whom do you believe in?
Seeker: I believe only in Hanumanji.

02:08:13.145 --> 02:08:14.911
Shri Mataji: Huh?
Seeker: I believe only in Hanumanji.

02:08:14.911 --> 02:08:17.403
Shri Mataji: Believe in Hanumanji.
And who is your guru?

02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:20.486
Seeker: He is in Vrindavan.
Shri Mataji: What?

02:08:20.486 --> 02:08:22.281
Seeker: He is in Vrindavan.
Shri Mataji: What is his name?

02:08:24.525 --> 02:08:28.645
Seeker: Rama Swami
Shri Mataji: It is Rama something?

02:08:29.439 --> 02:08:35.199
Seeker: Don't remember fully. He is
our Kulguru.
Sahaja Yogi: He is Kulguru, family
guru in other words.

02:08:35.401 --> 02:08:41.932
Shri Mataji: Just yesterday I told
you how can Kulguru's be - employed
by you. You cannot employ a guru,
isn't it?

02:08:42.462 --> 02:08:44.932
Seeker: They are just - they are
just being carried on.

02:08:44.932 --> 02:08:53.102
[UNCLEAR] they have just expanded
themselves. The thing is that Brahmins
are very clever. Actually, the caste
really is only in Brahmins.

02:08:53.102 --> 02:08:57.786
Now they have made them. Now they
have made arrangements to earn
money by making them.

02:08:57.786 --> 02:09:04.195
There is nothing else, there's no sense
in this, it's all a deception, it's all
a matter of understanding. Uselessly everyone

02:09:05.834 --> 02:09:21.384
Yes! Now tell him the mantra of
Mahakali. Tell him the mantra
of Mahishasura Mardini.

02:09:21.384 --> 02:09:27.872
Mahishasura Mardini. And take him to
the back and make him sit in the light.

02:09:29.044 --> 02:09:35.114
Has it come, has it come, son?
It's alright. Tie it, tie his Kundalini.

02:09:41.834 --> 02:09:55.514
Are you feeling the cool? Huh? A little
bit? Not feeling it? You brother?
Seeker: Not feeling it.

02:09:56.466 --> 02:10:00.806
Shri Mataji: You have  a lot of liver.
Forgive everyone, who all are you angry with?

02:10:00.806 --> 02:10:03.575
Seeker: I am not angry with anyone.
Shri Mataji: You are (angry) with yourself?

02:10:05.169 --> 02:10:11.359
Forgive yourself, come on, forgive
yourself. How many times do I tell
you to be cheerful, isn't it?

02:10:11.602 --> 02:10:18.502
Count your blessings one by one.
Stay cheerful; Look at him now,
he is sitting cheerfully.

02:10:20.392 --> 02:10:24.622
When I saw him the first day, I was
upset. I asked, "What does he do?"

02:10:24.622 --> 02:10:27.910
Replied/Said, "He is a lawyer."
I said, "Oh my God (UNCLEAR)."

02:10:35.466 --> 02:10:40.626
Place your right hand on the ground.
Who do you believe in?

02:10:42.424 --> 02:10:45.714
Woman: Devi and Hanumanji.
Don’t believe much.
Shri Mataji: What?

02:10:45.714 --> 02:10:47.718
Woman: Don't believe much in anyone.
Shri Mataji: What?

02:10:47.718 --> 02:10:52.026
Woman: Otherwise I don't believe much
in anyone.
Shri Mataji: But Devi, which Devi?

02:10:52.026 --> 02:10:55.221
Woman: Durga Devi.
Shri Mataji: Come on, put your right
hand on the ground.

02:10:55.221 --> 02:11:04.610
Okay, ask now, ask the question. Bring
a lemon, bring it, will give him.
Yes, ask the Durga Devi's question.

02:11:04.610 --> 02:11:13.934
Hey listen, tell him to ask Durga Devi's
question. Yes hold it, hold it tight.

02:11:44.444 --> 02:11:59.494
How are you? Huh? Both eyes. Open your
eyes, look at My feet and ask the question.

02:11:59.494 --> 02:12:08.594
Told him to ask The question? Yes!
Take the light, will happen with light.

02:12:12.563 --> 02:12:17.513
How are you?
Sahaja Yogi: (UNCLEAR) it's Vishuddhi, Vishuddhi

02:12:17.513 --> 02:12:18.513
Shri Mataji: What?
Sahaja Yogi: Vishuddhi

02:12:18.513 --> 02:12:20.954
Shri Mataji: See on the head, on the head.

02:12:31.515 --> 02:12:37.335
Why don't you people look? Look, see on
their heads. Did you get realization
or not?

02:12:37.730 --> 02:12:42.940
You've got it, right? Keep both your
hands like this. How did you not get it?
You have got realization. You're
getting vibrations in your hands.

02:12:43.786 --> 02:12:50.226
Seeker: Sometimes I feel hot.
Shri Mataji: Hot. Put your hand on your
liver. You know where the liver is?

02:12:50.226 --> 02:12:55.563
Yeah. Put your left hand, left hand,
right hand towards Me, haan.

02:12:55.742 --> 02:13:01.732
Shri Mataji: Has the cough subsided
somewhat since yesterday? Now try that
again, alright, and take that peepli
in your mouth.

02:13:05.338 --> 02:13:09.218
Sahaja Yogis: Please have the fan
turned off. It's very cold.
Please have the fan turned off.

02:13:09.218 --> 02:13:12.438
Shri Mataji: No, no, don't turn off
the fan.
Sahaja Yogi: Take him to the back.

02:13:12.438 --> 02:13:14.012
Shri Mataji: Otherwise the bhoots will
not run away.
Sahaja Yogi: Take him to the back.

02:13:14.012 --> 02:13:24.330
Shri Mataji: Take him back. Please
go back a little, son. You are not
feeling so much pain now.

02:13:24.376 --> 02:13:33.076
Look, when you came in front from there,
you felt a lot of pain. Get up, let's
see. Ah, did it pain? You got up
easily, right?

02:13:33.076 --> 02:13:35.211
Woman: I get up anyway.
Shri Mataji: Huh?

02:13:35.211 --> 02:13:37.853
Woman: I get up anyway. The pain is
felt even while sitting.
Shri Mataji: What are you saying?

02:13:37.853 --> 02:13:42.514
Woman: I get up anyway.
Shri Mataji: No, you do get up, but
while getting up it pained you a lot.

02:13:43.743 --> 02:13:48.553
Well! You got up now so it didn't pain
you. You stepped backwards even then
you didn't feel pain.

02:13:48.553 --> 02:13:56.712
When you came forward you came forward
with such a face. Isn't it? See, yes see,
come on. Take it out.

02:13:56.712 --> 02:14:03.937
Sahaja Yogi: Now he's enjoying.
Shri Mataji: Hmm, it has come? It's
just amazing. Give Me the lemon, put
the lemon here, put it down here.

02:14:09.473 --> 02:14:14.583
Rajesh is standing behind, yes.

02:14:14.733 --> 02:14:19.863
Well, settle his accounts.
Tell him who is standing there.

02:14:19.863 --> 02:14:23.113
Sahaja Yogi: No, he is not standing for
that. He saying he wants to do Sahaja Yoga.

02:14:23.113 --> 02:14:33.571
Shri Mataji: Wants to do Sahaja Yoga?
Your face has changed, and in your
speech yesterday,

02:14:33.571 --> 02:14:39.201
have you seen it, don't know if you
have noticed it or not -
very clearly a very fluent speech.

02:14:39.201 --> 02:14:41.287
Seeker: I prepared it in English, Mataji.
Shri Mataji: What?

02:14:41.287 --> 02:14:44.989
Seeker: My Hindi used to be very messed up.
Shri Mataji: But nothing, you spoke
such good Hindi.

02:14:44.996 --> 02:14:47.769
Seeker: I spoke with Your blessings
otherwise I was not ready.

02:14:47.769 --> 02:14:52.999
Spoke such good Hindi. On the day earlier
when the speech was given, I said that,

02:14:52.999 --> 02:14:55.082
"What is he speaking, I cannot
understand anything."

02:14:55.082 --> 02:14:59.663
Yesterday you spoke just so fluently
that really you spoke very well in Hindi.

02:15:01.020 --> 02:15:07.720
Hmm, you are fine sir. This is your
lemon - it needs to be treated.

02:15:08.211 --> 02:15:16.741
Bring a piece of paper, paper.
Yes, give it, give it, give it.

02:15:32.428 --> 02:15:37.218
Now tell some servant to cut it
and throw it in the sea.
You don't cut.

02:15:37.932 --> 02:15:43.322
Otherwise you will catch, understand?
Put it down, leave it. Yes, take
it when you go.

02:15:43.322 --> 02:15:49.497
Feeling better now? Feeling lighter?
Now meditate; with meditation all
your illnesses will go away.

02:15:49.497 --> 02:15:52.067
Okay! You should meditate more
for your left side.

02:15:52.067 --> 02:15:56.828
Left hand towards the photo, right
hand on the ground and on it,
on the photo, a lamp to be lit.

02:15:56.828 --> 02:16:04.562
Ok! Put the photo on a raised board
and - you all have photos or if you
want I can give you a good one.

02:16:05.088 --> 02:16:09.648
Seeker: Want a good one, a good one.
Shri Mataji: Go and get it.

02:16:10.186 --> 02:16:12.534
Seeker: Mataji, want a coloured
one, coloured.
Shri Mataji: What?

02:16:12.534 --> 02:16:16.998
Seeker: I need coloured.
Shri Mataji: Colour. It's not a photograph,
it's a print but beautiful it is.

02:16:16.998 --> 02:16:21.617
It is of Mahalakshmi. Oh, what a catch!

02:16:29.336 --> 02:16:33.016
Sahaja Yogi: He is getting a catch
in the left heart.
Shri Mataji: In the heart? Okay,
keep your hand on the heart.

02:16:33.016 --> 02:16:37.780
And say, 'You are Shiva, Mother,
You are Shiva.'
Sahaja Yogi: Take the mantra with
your eyes open.

02:16:37.780 --> 02:16:40.570
Shri Mataji: Open your eyes son,
open your eyes.
Sahaja Yogi: Open your eyes
and look towards Mother.

02:16:42.493 --> 02:16:49.553
Shri Mataji: Is it done? Is it
coming or not? Is it still hot?
Let it continue, let it continue.

02:16:50.601 --> 02:16:58.331
Do you get angry a lot? Give him
some ice, he will put it on his
stomach, on his liver.

02:16:58.494 --> 02:17:08.724
Come, come. Pick up that purse
from there.
Seeker: Mataji, he is our
district governor.

02:17:08.724 --> 02:17:12.121
Shri Mataji: Okay.
Seeker: On the same position as
Mohanlalji has been before.

02:17:12.121 --> 02:17:16.168
Shri Mataji: Okay. So did you get
the vibrations or not?

02:17:17.473 --> 02:17:20.783
Seeker: You said it takes time.
Shri Mataji: In some cases.

02:17:20.783 --> 02:17:29.332
Keep both your hands. Hmm, someone
just see. Keep your hands like this.

02:17:37.131 --> 02:17:41.101
Mamaji(Uncle), did I not give you
this photo? Okay, I'll give it to you.

02:17:41.415 --> 02:17:47.305
Didn’t you give it to mamaji?
Sahaja Yogi: Mamaji(UNCLEAR)
Shri Mataji: No, I'll call him mamaji only.

02:17:48.461 --> 02:17:53.921
I don't have mama anymore, so
I need a mama. Take it.

02:17:57.118 --> 02:18:00.128
Sahaja Yogi: You have become the whole
world's mama. What to say/can be said!

02:18:07.170 --> 02:18:13.850
Shri Mataji: Now these are all the
photos; you people distribute them,
one to each. Just one per family.

02:18:14.579 --> 02:18:16.689
Seeker: Nandi, you give with your hands.

02:18:27.774 --> 02:18:35.714
Shri Mataji: This is only one, whom
should it be given to?
It's a very fantastic one.

02:18:37.295 --> 02:18:40.585
Sahaja Yogi: This is Yours in Dharamshala.
Shri Mataji: [UNCLEAR - This is Guru Nathji]

02:18:40.673 --> 02:18:43.493
This is of Mahalakshmi.
Sahaja Yogi: Who else needs it?

02:18:46.286 --> 02:18:48.736
Seeker: What is this right heart?
Shri Mataji: Unh?

02:18:49.119 --> 02:18:52.849
Seeker: Heart gets very disturbed
whenever I walk.
Shri Mataji: What happened?

02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:55.554
Seeker: My heart remains very disturbed.
Shri Mataji: Remains disturbed?

02:18:55.554 --> 02:18:58.936
Sahaja Yogi: Mataji what is written here?
Shri Mataji: No idea what it is (UNCLEAR).

02:18:58.936 --> 02:19:03.405
Sahaja Yogi: The method of meditation etc.
is written, how (UNCLEAR) Whose is this?

02:19:03.405 --> 02:19:05.504
Shri Mataji: This is for you.
Sahaja Yogi: The program handout that
has been given to you it's the same.

02:19:05.504 --> 02:19:12.135
Shri Mataji: The handout that has been
given it's that only. Now keep it.

02:19:14.820 --> 02:19:19.370
You also keep your left hand towards
Me and your right hand on the ground.

02:19:30.057 --> 02:19:35.877
It's fine now. You should say both
the mantras that he has told you.

02:19:35.877 --> 02:19:38.438
Photo, did you get the photo?
Give him the photo.

02:19:47.850 --> 02:19:58.030
Is it coming? How are you now?
It's still there. It's still going on.

02:19:58.030 --> 02:20:01.726
Just now - is it okay in your hand?
It's hot there right now.

02:20:11.548 --> 02:20:23.518
I'm removing yours in this. In a vegetarian
way. Earlier hens were slaughtered.

02:20:24.467 --> 02:20:28.427
Earlier the hen was slaughtered - this
is vegetarian. Now you can understand
the condition.

02:20:29.074 --> 02:20:34.194
Alright? Are you getting the cool?
Someone will have to check.

02:20:34.254 --> 02:20:40.194
Okay, put your hand on him.
Someone - come and see.

02:20:40.903 --> 02:20:44.603
I think you will get it if you sit
in front; You come in front.

02:20:47.507 --> 02:20:53.597
A lot of vibrations have come due to
the photos. The work will be done quickly.

02:20:56.926 --> 02:21:05.416
Yes! Tell, you are younger to Me
by two years. Do you know her?

02:21:05.988 --> 02:21:09.098
Seeker: He came.
Shri Mataji: Good! How are you?

02:21:09.098 --> 02:21:11.526
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, he is established.
Shri Mataji: Yes, he is a journalist.

02:21:11.526 --> 02:21:20.541
Seeker: He is a chartered accountant.
Shri Mataji: You too? Okay, okay. Unh?

02:21:20.541 --> 02:21:23.047
Seeker: I am also publishing a magazine.
Shri Mataji: Good!

02:21:23.755 --> 02:21:32.195
Seeker: With that the Maharashtra trio,
Tule, Salve, will be seen.
Shri Mataji: Tule, Salve and who else?

02:21:32.195 --> 02:21:37.902
Seeker: (UNCLEAR)
Shri Mataji: All three have gone.
Sathe is still there.

02:21:44.572 --> 02:21:48.692
It's filled to the brim. No problem.
Yes.

02:21:48.943 --> 02:21:54.973
He got into the wrong thing. No one
can escape once one enters politics.

02:21:54.973 --> 02:22:02.119
Like this, like this, like this, like
this, it's a spiral. It's whirly, can't
leave. Addiction, it's an addiction.

02:22:02.611 --> 02:22:06.061
I was very much against him, but
he did not listen.

02:22:06.061 --> 02:22:08.797
I said, "What do you have to do with
this? What's the need for this?"

02:22:09.670 --> 02:22:14.530
Now he has changed but earlier he
was very much into politics.

02:22:14.530 --> 02:22:24.091
But can't get out of it, it's an
addiction. Otherwise, he is very expert
in his work. He is a smart man.

02:22:24.091 --> 02:22:28.721
My younger brother has got his
realization, such big, very good,
good - telling about Baba Mama.

02:22:28.721 --> 02:22:35.302
Yes, that one, H.K.P. He is now running
his company, the younger one, H.K.P.

02:22:35.302 --> 02:22:42.575
And the brother in the middle is a judge
of the Bombay High Court. The middle one
is also realized, he is still like that.

02:22:43.727 --> 02:22:46.767
Seeker: Mother, I am not able to
get it at all.

02:22:46.767 --> 02:22:51.894
Sahaja Yogi: Meaning he had left nabhi,
left Agnya - it was cleared,
he is not feeling it.

02:22:51.894 --> 02:22:56.131
Seeker: I am not feeling it.
Shri Mataji: Well, you have ego, he's saying.
Do not say such things, he will beat you.

02:23:00.494 --> 02:23:07.074
Okay, give him realization. Give him
realization - is there anyone? Have
all these Rustom and others run away?

02:23:07.999 --> 02:23:12.219
[MARATHI]

02:23:12.399 --> 02:23:15.210
Rustom, come and give realization
- where are you people?

02:23:15.659 --> 02:23:19.159
Oh, where did Rajesh go - he didn't
give realization to anyone.

02:23:21.499 --> 02:23:26.509
[MARATHI]

02:23:27.864 --> 02:23:33.874
Yes, I gave you realization using a lemon.
Got it, are you feeling the cool?

02:23:34.847 --> 02:23:40.557
Yes, this lemon, everything is
trapped in one lemon - I have
solved all your problems in/through this.

02:23:40.557 --> 02:23:54.019
So look at this, remove the photo,
do both your hands like this, do
like this.

02:23:59.199 --> 02:24:01.459
Okay, that's better.

02:24:01.459 --> 02:24:05.305
Did you now understand what I said? Yes!

02:24:13.062 --> 02:24:16.592
Sahaja Yogi: The whole left side.
Shri Mataji: There's a catch on the
left side?

02:24:17.559 --> 02:24:25.719
Who is your Guru? You must have
to someone? Never? There is a
catch on the left side.

02:24:25.719 --> 02:24:29.669
Sahaja Yogi: [UNCLEAR – slightly reduced?}
Seeker: (UNCLEAR)

02:24:29.669 --> 02:24:32.877
Shri Mataji: Unh?
Sahaja Yogi: Now he is fine.
He has a Guru.

02:24:32.877 --> 02:24:36.842
Sahaj yogi: Left Swadhishthan is
very strong.
Shri Mataji: Did you go to a Tantrik?

02:24:37.338 --> 02:24:40.208
Sahaja Yogi: Some Sahaja Yogis
will become committed.
Shri Mataji: Unh?

02:24:40.208 --> 02:24:43.474
Sahaja Yogi: Will become committed
He's already got a bad liver.

02:24:43.549 --> 02:24:46.329
Shri Mataji: Come on, keep this
