00:00:46.784 --> 00:00:49.024
Today is Easter

00:00:49.054 --> 00:00:51.004
and all of you celebrate it.

00:00:52.024 --> 00:00:54.594
It’s rather surprising, you see,
there are people believing in science

00:00:54.594 --> 00:00:57.094
and everything, these days
they offer you an egg.

00:00:57.094 --> 00:00:58.964
But they should believe in Christ

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:01.464
or they should believe
in his Resurrection.

00:01:01.464 --> 00:01:03.964
It’s absolutely unscientific

00:01:03.964 --> 00:01:07.574
but we accept it without
asking “why?” and “how?”.

00:01:09.908 --> 00:01:12.408
You never question Easter.

00:01:12.408 --> 00:01:15.773
But certain things, when they appear
new to us, we start questioning

00:01:15.773 --> 00:01:18.273
and want to bring it to the science,

00:01:18.267 --> 00:01:19.673
to the reality of it.

00:01:19.677 --> 00:01:23.267
But certain things we just
accept: his Resurrection.

00:01:27.643 --> 00:01:30.843
Now, we have for Easter

00:01:30.863 --> 00:01:35.163
the thing that we give, an egg

00:01:35.183 --> 00:01:36.393
on an Easter day.

00:01:36.393 --> 00:01:37.643
Now, why do we do it?

00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:39.953
If you are that rational,
you must think about it:

00:01:39.963 --> 00:01:42.463
why do we give an egg?

00:01:44.892 --> 00:01:47.237
We never think about it we just do it

00:01:47.237 --> 00:01:50.407
because it’s a custom of
the great grand-mother

00:01:50.407 --> 00:01:53.777
and the grandmother did
it and the mother will do

00:01:53.797 --> 00:01:56.297
and then the child does it.

00:01:58.497 --> 00:01:59.638
So, we just do it

00:01:59.655 --> 00:02:04.025
just as an accepted thing.

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:07.358
You are not bothered to find out “why?”.

00:02:07.366 --> 00:02:10.178
Why are we to give an egg
and not something else?

00:02:10.188 --> 00:02:12.495
What does it show

00:02:12.495 --> 00:02:16.991
when there is no mention
of an egg in the Bible,

00:02:17.015 --> 00:02:20.018
as far as I know?

00:02:20.042 --> 00:02:24.878
But there is a mention
in this Devi Bhagavatam

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:28.476
about an egg and Christ.

00:02:32.115 --> 00:02:36.692
And everybody is doing it

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.380
without understanding
what does that mean.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.540
How did we get that
symbol, from where?

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.090
Of course, now it is
accepted scientifically

00:02:51.106 --> 00:02:56.420
that there is some sort of a universal
unconscious which gives us symbols.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.250
People accept that. Many
have, not all of them,

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:01.280
but many accept it.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.444
So, we have to say that this symbol has
come to us definitely from the unconscious.

00:03:06.444 --> 00:03:08.324
But it must have
come to many people

00:03:08.324 --> 00:03:14.084
so that people have accepted this
symbol of an egg on an Easter day.

00:03:19.524 --> 00:03:25.630
The symbol of egg

00:03:25.644 --> 00:03:29.621
is that the egg is twice born.

00:03:31.148 --> 00:03:35.518
In Sanskrit language, a
bird is called as “dvijaha”.

00:03:35.538 --> 00:03:38.216
Bird is called as a “dvijaha”.

00:03:38.216 --> 00:03:43.347
And the Brahmin are reborn, or twice
born, are also called as “dvijaha”.

00:03:43.377 --> 00:03:48.977
Dvi-jaha, dvijaha in Sanskrit language
means the one who is born twice.

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:56.021
It’s a birth of a Brahmin.

00:03:58.018 --> 00:04:03.758
So, first, the egg

00:04:03.798 --> 00:04:06.298
comes

00:04:06.298 --> 00:04:08.798
just as a living thing.

00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:12.198
Egg is a living thing, you know that,

00:04:12.198 --> 00:04:14.698
fully developed outside, not inside.

00:04:15.888 --> 00:04:19.308
Egg does not develop after it has come out

00:04:19.328 --> 00:04:21.318
of the mother’s womb.

00:04:21.346 --> 00:04:24.738
It is the same size, but
inside something happens.

00:04:24.738 --> 00:04:29.038
It grows with the want.

00:04:30.867 --> 00:04:34.481
And a change comes into it.

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:37.207
That growth and everything that comes

00:04:37.207 --> 00:04:40.575
into an egg is built into it.

00:04:41.764 --> 00:04:44.264
It is his own right.

00:04:46.504 --> 00:04:50.936
He’s made like that.
That’s the way he is made.

00:04:50.962 --> 00:04:53.902
But the bird has to come out of it.

00:04:53.932 --> 00:04:57.862
It is made like that. That
is why it is “sahaja”.

00:04:57.892 --> 00:05:00.392
That is, you are born with it, “sahaja”,

00:05:00.392 --> 00:05:01.857
you are born with it.

00:05:01.853 --> 00:05:06.977
An egg is born with it
to be a bird. All right?

00:05:08.407 --> 00:05:14.881
In the same way, Christ was
born to be resurrected.

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:17.416
See the vibrations I made.

00:05:20.056 --> 00:05:25.916
His Resurrection gave us the
way for our Resurrection too,

00:05:25.946 --> 00:05:28.776
for our jumping into the Unconscious.

00:05:28.806 --> 00:05:32.346
He did it for us though
He did not need it.

00:05:33.216 --> 00:05:35.716
He came on this earth, lived like us.

00:05:35.716 --> 00:05:38.216
He was a human being

00:05:38.216 --> 00:05:41.336
and He jumped into that,

00:05:41.366 --> 00:05:43.866
giving us a way, clearing a way for us,

00:05:43.866 --> 00:05:46.366
showing the path. And He
did it with his birth.

00:05:46.366 --> 00:05:49.856
"Savayah" as they call it in Sanskrit.

00:05:49.896 --> 00:05:53.856
His whole body, He lifted because
He was Divine Power itself.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:57.346
He was made out of the “Om”. He
was made out of the Brahma itself.

00:05:57.346 --> 00:06:00.514
He was nothing but vibrations, you see.

00:06:00.546 --> 00:06:01.906
His body was nothing but vibrations.

00:06:01.906 --> 00:06:05.296
So whatever was a little bit of
the earth element fell down

00:06:05.358 --> 00:06:09.076
and the rest of it was resurrected.

00:06:10.306 --> 00:06:12.652
In the presence of human beings,

00:06:12.652 --> 00:06:15.152
His soul is being resurrected.

00:06:15.152 --> 00:06:21.072
See, it has a very big meaning but the
human being’s soul is being resurrected.

00:06:21.112 --> 00:06:24.932
Because if they had not seen it, they
would never have been believed it.

00:06:24.962 --> 00:06:27.912
He could have resurrected
himself in some corner.

00:06:30.092 --> 00:06:34.542
He could have done that. There
was no need for him to appear by.

00:06:34.577 --> 00:06:38.132
But He did it openly
before everybody else

00:06:38.174 --> 00:06:44.665
to see that He is bodily resurrected.

00:06:44.685 --> 00:06:47.885
In the Devi Mahatmya
(Devi Bhagavatam)

00:06:47.895 --> 00:06:50.405
Christ is described as Mahavishnu.

00:06:50.405 --> 00:06:53.465
Devi is the Goddess, is the Mother,

00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:55.015
the Primordial Mother,

00:06:55.037 --> 00:06:57.937
and in her

00:06:57.957 --> 00:07:00.457
life story we can
say, Mahatmya’s story.

00:07:00.457 --> 00:07:02.957
For Goddess, they
never say life-story

00:07:02.957 --> 00:07:05.457
but they say...

00:07:08.011 --> 00:07:10.511
[Shri Mataji seems to ask aside].

00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:15.501
Like you see, you cannot
say life-story for Christ,

00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:20.351
He being a divine person. Divine person
doesn’t have a life, it has a beginning and end.

00:07:20.381 --> 00:07:24.951
So, what you can say is the importance.
“Mahatmya," should be important.

00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.451
The importance of Devi is
described: the Goddess.

00:07:27.451 --> 00:07:29.331
And in that, they have described

00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:34.033
that first He was created as an egg

00:07:34.068 --> 00:07:37.238
in the Vaikuntha, is another dimension.

00:07:37.278 --> 00:07:39.778
So the egg is the symbol of the Christ

00:07:39.778 --> 00:07:43.147
who came on this earth
and his Resurrection.

00:07:43.178 --> 00:07:47.497
It’s a message for all of us that
you all are going to be resurrected.

00:07:47.497 --> 00:07:50.715
You all are going to jump
into that Unconscious,

00:07:50.727 --> 00:07:53.657
into that All-pervading Power.

00:07:53.687 --> 00:07:58.167
You all are going to be triggered,
that is the message of Easter.

00:07:59.995 --> 00:08:02.495
Now, how you are made
like an egg yourself?

00:08:02.495 --> 00:08:04.025
Just see. It’s very interesting.

00:08:04.056 --> 00:08:06.556
You, yourself, you
are made like an egg.

00:08:08.216 --> 00:08:12.416
The shell develops around you.

00:08:12.426 --> 00:08:16.616
If you have the diagram of the things that
I’ve given you, have you got anyone of you?

00:08:16.616 --> 00:08:18.746
Anyone has a chart?

00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:22.181
If you have a chart you can put it up
somewhere here. You can show them.

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:28.476
In the chart inside...

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:31.966
now the human being
are made in such a way

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:35.766
that they have within them the
sympathetic nervous system on both sides

00:08:35.766 --> 00:08:37.846
and the parasympathetic
in the centre.

00:08:37.846 --> 00:08:41.356
The sympathetic we
use for our activity.

00:08:41.356 --> 00:08:45.436
Left and right, both sympathetic,
we use for our activity,

00:08:45.476 --> 00:08:47.976
for our emergency activity especially.

00:08:47.976 --> 00:08:50.476
And the parasympathetic is
the one which balances,

00:08:50.476 --> 00:08:54.836
nourishes, looks after and coordinates.

00:08:54.871 --> 00:08:59.516
Now, these sympathetic activities
give us ego and superego.

00:08:59.566 --> 00:09:02.066
The ego goes like this and
superego goes like that.

00:09:02.066 --> 00:09:06.966
Because, actually, the ego comes up like this
and the superego like this, you can see like that.

00:09:06.996 --> 00:09:10.316
And where is the
path? From where it starts?

00:09:10.333 --> 00:09:14.423
These ego and superego, both
of them, give us that shell.

00:09:14.442 --> 00:09:18.863
Then it closes down, here in the head,
when the child is a small baby.

00:09:18.893 --> 00:09:21.393
Then the shell is complete,
you become a shell.

00:09:23.343 --> 00:09:26.313
So, you live within your shell,

00:09:26.343 --> 00:09:29.383
you are identified with your shell,

00:09:29.423 --> 00:09:31.923
with your ego and superego.

00:09:31.923 --> 00:09:36.533
That is your conditionings and
your ego. You know what ego is!

00:09:36.533 --> 00:09:40.368
All of you know what it
is like, horrid thing.

00:09:42.138 --> 00:09:46.025
It becomes only a barrier for a chick.

00:09:46.075 --> 00:09:48.505
For the chick, it is horrid the shell.

00:09:48.535 --> 00:09:53.715
When it is awakened,
then it gets its life.

00:09:53.745 --> 00:09:56.245
Otherwise, it is nicely
settled down there,

00:09:56.245 --> 00:10:00.395
it’s not bothered.

00:10:00.405 --> 00:10:04.545
When you are awakened inside,

00:10:04.575 --> 00:10:09.454
then you start seeing also the shell
around you and you want to break it.

00:10:11.068 --> 00:10:12.733
You want to get out of it.

00:10:12.733 --> 00:10:17.066
You become aware of the
decisions and comfort of ego.

00:10:17.056 --> 00:10:18.966
Yes.

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:22.313
Do you know you become
aware of that shell,

00:10:22.343 --> 00:10:24.973
that ego.

00:10:25.003 --> 00:10:27.503
Especially in the Western life as it is,

00:10:27.503 --> 00:10:32.335
you know, it's ego oriented.
It's pampered all the time,

00:10:32.365 --> 00:10:34.825
in competition, in this and that.

00:10:35.834 --> 00:10:37.074
And you become that,

00:10:37.094 --> 00:10:40.674
you are identified with it because
you are just an ordinary egg.

00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:45.154
But if you are awakened, suddenly you
start seeing the shell around you,

00:10:45.154 --> 00:10:47.194
you want to get out of it,

00:10:47.206 --> 00:10:49.706
just over ride it.

00:10:49.706 --> 00:10:53.128
You think, if you get out of
it, you’ll have your wings

00:10:53.128 --> 00:10:57.168
and you'll spread your wings and you’ll
fly in the air, in the space.

00:10:58.888 --> 00:11:03.260
That feeling comes into you when you
separate yourself from the shell.

00:11:04.270 --> 00:11:07.250
That happens with the
Kundalini awakening.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.551
When the Kundalini is awakened in you,

00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:16.861
then you start feeling that, “There is something
inside me which is keeping me still down.

00:11:16.861 --> 00:11:22.314
There’s something that’s pushing me down
still and I have to break the shell.”

00:11:24.443 --> 00:11:26.943
So, a hole has to be made.

00:11:26.943 --> 00:11:30.968
That is a simple thing, it’s baptism.

00:11:31.023 --> 00:11:36.233
The hole that is made
in a shell is baptism.

00:11:36.239 --> 00:11:40.942
So, we see there are two stages.

00:11:40.971 --> 00:11:46.372
First, is the awakening has to take place.

00:11:46.391 --> 00:11:49.092
First, the awakening has to,

00:11:49.092 --> 00:11:52.021
if there is no awakening,
nothing will happen,

00:11:52.021 --> 00:11:54.521
An egg will remain an
egg. It will become dirty,

00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:56.862
or it may at the most become rotten.

00:11:56.862 --> 00:12:01.022
After some time, it
becomes a rotten thing.

00:12:01.049 --> 00:12:03.469
And it is all wasted.

00:12:03.469 --> 00:12:06.219
If somebody knows how to
give it the warmth of love

00:12:06.229 --> 00:12:08.129
and proper handling and all that

00:12:08.149 --> 00:12:11.780
try and mature,  properly.

00:12:11.799 --> 00:12:15.029
But supposing, even while
raising the Kundalini,

00:12:15.058 --> 00:12:17.479
there is some part which is still left,

00:12:17.479 --> 00:12:20.289
not yet attained yet, not developed,

00:12:20.319 --> 00:12:22.819
the Kundalini will go there and support it

00:12:22.819 --> 00:12:24.229
and try to develop it.

00:12:24.235 --> 00:12:28.169
At least, it will make so much
so that when it is broken,

00:12:28.194 --> 00:12:32.598
it is able to start to
withstand the outside.

00:12:33.828 --> 00:12:38.982
Now, we can also think, “Why
we are made into a shell?”

00:12:39.018 --> 00:12:41.518
We are made into a shell,

00:12:41.518 --> 00:12:43.338
we are made into an egg

00:12:43.346 --> 00:12:47.868
because that is the only way you
can be protected and can be growing.

00:12:47.868 --> 00:12:52.558
And the evolutionary second stage of jumping
into the Unconscious can be brought in.

00:12:53.978 --> 00:12:56.858
You develop within yourself,
through your seeking

00:12:56.858 --> 00:13:00.158
and things, a kind of a wisdom

00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:04.308
and the wisdom is the
only way you are judged.

00:13:05.802 --> 00:13:09.312
I mean, you may be the most
brilliant man all around the world,

00:13:09.312 --> 00:13:13.917
but if you lack wisdom,
you are no good.

00:13:13.951 --> 00:13:17.731
Wisdom is very different from
the so-called knowledge.

00:13:17.747 --> 00:13:21.721
When you mature, the
wisdom grows into you.

00:13:21.747 --> 00:13:24.247
And then, whenever wisdom
is sufficient enough,

00:13:25.367 --> 00:13:30.208
then a little break
is needed, that’s all.

00:13:30.228 --> 00:13:33.324
And the bird comes out, developed.

00:13:33.348 --> 00:13:37.274
But most of the eggs, I found, have
been already punctured with some things.

00:13:38.484 --> 00:13:41.475
Already somebody has
punctured something.

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:46.181
That’s why I’m so
angry with other gurus.

00:13:48.154 --> 00:13:52.344
As I told you before, I don’t mind! If they
want to make money, let them make money.

00:13:52.344 --> 00:13:54.440
If they want to have
women, let them have women,

00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:56.940
if they want to smother,
let them smother.

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:02.000
But they have no business to spoil your
Kundalini as they are spoiling your Kundalini.

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.430
And I am very angry with them.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.238
And I have to tell you very frankly
that they are satanic people.

00:14:08.238 --> 00:14:11.160
They are killing the egg in you.

00:14:12.408 --> 00:14:14.908
The germinating power in
you is killed by them.

00:14:16.568 --> 00:14:21.094
They are giving you
something, such a poison,

00:14:21.117 --> 00:14:24.067
that you cannot get your Resurrection.

00:14:24.077 --> 00:14:26.887
They are taking away
your fundamental right.

00:14:27.957 --> 00:14:30.457
You do not know what
they are doing to you.

00:14:30.479 --> 00:14:32.979
That’s why,

00:14:32.979 --> 00:14:37.297
you do not understand why
I condemn them completely.

00:15:00.988 --> 00:15:33.373
(Conversation with Yogis
and refreshment break)

00:16:49.023 --> 00:16:53.343
So we have to remember that
when the shell breaks,

00:16:53.341 --> 00:16:55.201
when the egg breaks,

00:16:55.198 --> 00:16:57.698
part of the shell dies, all right?

00:16:57.698 --> 00:17:03.131
Part of the shell dies, I mean, the whole
shell dies but the chick is left out.

00:17:04.711 --> 00:17:10.031
The part that is no
more needed dies out.

00:17:10.046 --> 00:17:15.390
So something in us also dies
out and has to die out:

00:17:15.412 --> 00:17:20.702
and that is what is the
past and the future.

00:17:20.702 --> 00:17:24.292
The past and the future dies out
and you live in the present.

00:17:27.092 --> 00:17:31.130
When the past dies
out, what dies out?

00:17:33.455 --> 00:17:35.955
You just think about your past.

00:17:37.405 --> 00:17:41.885
The essence of what was good
in your past is taken up.

00:17:41.904 --> 00:17:44.404
Only the dead past which was in you

00:17:44.404 --> 00:17:49.268
which was not giving any
substance to the body dies out.

00:17:52.468 --> 00:17:57.548
So you don’t have to bother about your
karmas anymore once you are Realised.

00:17:57.548 --> 00:17:59.028
No more resurrection of your karmas.

00:17:59.028 --> 00:18:03.906
There are some people who’ll tell you:
“You have to wash your karmas. ”

00:18:06.176 --> 00:18:12.706
How can you wash something
which is with you?

00:18:12.728 --> 00:18:16.809
If you separate yourself then
you may start washing it.

00:18:16.838 --> 00:18:19.338
But you cannot wash something
that is within you.

00:18:19.338 --> 00:18:24.794
You have to take it out. And that
is what is taken out as a shell.

00:18:24.794 --> 00:18:27.814
And your wisdom works it out.

00:18:27.834 --> 00:18:31.374
This is the freedom given to you

00:18:31.394 --> 00:18:36.114
to choose

00:18:36.124 --> 00:18:38.624
the middle path of existence

00:18:38.624 --> 00:18:45.805
by which you put all such things that
are not required for this process,

00:18:45.815 --> 00:18:51.045
the last process, the best process,
the highest process of resurrection,

00:18:51.085 --> 00:18:53.223
on the sides, on all the sides,

00:18:53.223 --> 00:18:55.723
to be in the centre.

00:18:55.723 --> 00:19:00.144
Not extremes of anything, no.

00:19:00.168 --> 00:19:03.044
In the nature, we seldom
found such funny eggs.

00:19:03.074 --> 00:19:05.574
But in the human being, we do find.

00:19:05.574 --> 00:19:09.626
Sometimes I find there are too much bulging
out egos are coming just like a horn, you know

00:19:09.626 --> 00:19:12.126
like a unicorn.  (Unclear)

00:19:12.126 --> 00:19:15.326
Everywhere they start,
that’s very aggressive.

00:19:15.346 --> 00:19:19.336
And they are not aware of
how aggressive they are.

00:19:19.356 --> 00:19:22.026
Sometimes, they develop superego

00:19:22.046 --> 00:19:23.999
by which they say:
“We are very afraid,

00:19:24.026 --> 00:19:27.990
this has happened, that has happened.”
And you know they’re useless people.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.816
All kinds of imbalances in
a human being are possible.

00:19:33.816 --> 00:19:37.394
Not so much in the
eggs, it’s surprising.

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:41.564
Perhaps, because you have the
freedom to develop the imbalances.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.040
You have the freedom to be crooked.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.910
You have the freedom to be complicated.

00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.420
You have the freedom to ruin
yourself, spoil yourself

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.580
and finish off.

00:19:52.580 --> 00:19:56.589
You can do it, not animals.

00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.469
Human beings can only do it.

00:19:58.469 --> 00:20:01.399
And this freedom is such a blessing

00:20:01.429 --> 00:20:06.477
and such a great promise that even
God cannot take it out of you.

00:20:06.483 --> 00:20:10.887
In your own freedom when you
seek, in your own freedom,

00:20:10.919 --> 00:20:14.717
when you ask for wisdom,
then this can happen.

00:20:16.966 --> 00:20:20.202
If you do not seek and if you do
not ask, it’s not going to happen.

00:20:20.202 --> 00:20:23.983
You will only ask when you are
wise otherwise you will not ask.

00:20:23.983 --> 00:20:27.873
Your mind will be going to materialism,

00:20:27.883 --> 00:20:30.383
it will be go into some
sort of a politic: politics.

00:20:30.383 --> 00:20:34.953
It will be going to something
else, to something very unimportant.

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.473
But with wisdom you feel that you have
to be reborn that’s the main thing,

00:20:41.503 --> 00:20:44.833
after all, that’s what you get
it. You have to get to that point.

00:20:44.863 --> 00:20:48.563
When this wisdom comes to
you, it just happens.

00:20:48.583 --> 00:20:51.083
Then you ask for it and
that is why it is said

00:20:51.083 --> 00:20:54.573
that “you have to ask for it. ”

00:20:57.153 --> 00:20:59.653
The wisdom is not going to
fall at your feet and say:

00:20:59.653 --> 00:21:04.129
“Oh, you be wise for heaven sake!”

00:21:04.153 --> 00:21:07.807
It’s not going to request you.

00:21:07.836 --> 00:21:10.917
It has to mature into you,

00:21:10.936 --> 00:21:13.317
develop into you

00:21:13.317 --> 00:21:15.817
and fulfil itself.

00:21:15.817 --> 00:21:21.021
And then you feel that your
wisdom has been blessed.

00:21:22.864 --> 00:21:25.271
Your wisdom itself

00:21:25.271 --> 00:21:27.171
gives you that satisfaction.

00:21:27.171 --> 00:21:29.871
In the Gita, it’s written:
“Atmaneva Atmane Shrushta”

00:21:29.881 --> 00:21:33.371
your Spirit itself gets
satisfied of itself. ”

00:21:33.405 --> 00:21:36.975
Atmaneva Atmane Shrushta"
means you get satisfied,

00:21:36.975 --> 00:21:41.715
your Spirit itself gets satisfied
in its own manifestation.

00:21:41.737 --> 00:21:45.405
You get satisfied with yourself.

00:21:45.427 --> 00:21:47.927
There’s one poet who has written
a poem on it, it’s beautiful,

00:21:47.927 --> 00:21:49.595
he said that: “With Sahaja Yoga,

00:21:49.602 --> 00:21:53.485
the sandalwood starts smelling the
fragrance of sainthood itself.”

00:21:55.637 --> 00:22:00.577
And this is the message for all of
us on an Easter day of resurrection.

00:22:02.607 --> 00:22:06.615
But we do not bother about
resurrection in our everyday life.

00:22:06.635 --> 00:22:09.135
We want to have the cross on us,

00:22:09.135 --> 00:22:11.635
we want to carry the cross.

00:22:11.635 --> 00:22:13.265
"I am carrying that cross."

00:22:13.265 --> 00:22:17.955
Who are you to carry
the cross? That’s a joke!

00:22:17.985 --> 00:22:21.231
You don’t carry the cross,
somebody came for that,

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:26.501
to carry the cross for
you and who did the job.

00:22:27.878 --> 00:22:30.571
But you have to believe
only in one thing

00:22:30.571 --> 00:22:33.908
that you can be resurrected also.

00:22:33.941 --> 00:22:36.441
You don’t have to carry
any crosses anymore.

00:22:39.441 --> 00:22:43.638
You don’t have to take any
responsibility of any such things.

00:22:43.663 --> 00:22:47.308
The One who has created you,
the One who has nourished you,

00:22:47.308 --> 00:22:51.307
the One who has made you from an
amoeba to this stage as a human being,

00:22:51.307 --> 00:22:55.058
He’s going to do it himself.
But you have to ask for it.

00:22:55.058 --> 00:23:01.280
That is a condition because you
are free. You understand that point?

00:23:01.318 --> 00:23:07.500
The freedom of choosing God is in you.

00:23:07.528 --> 00:23:10.028
And you have to use your freedom.

00:23:10.028 --> 00:23:12.528
In your freedom, if you have,

00:23:12.528 --> 00:23:13.768
in your freedom,

00:23:13.768 --> 00:23:18.058
not out of hypnosis or anything, but
in your complete freedom when you ask,

00:23:18.056 --> 00:23:20.556
you will get it.

00:23:20.556 --> 00:23:25.815
Is it clear? And that is what is the
message for us is of resurrection.

00:23:25.815 --> 00:23:30.686
Today is a great day, although
it has been the greatest day.

00:23:30.686 --> 00:23:33.186
Because, at the time of Krishna,

00:23:33.186 --> 00:23:37.256
Jehovah as they call him,
Jehovah is the name of Krishna.

00:23:37.256 --> 00:23:38.496
He said that:

00:23:38.484 --> 00:23:45.534
“Nainam chindanti shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah, na chainam kledayantyapo na shoshaya ti mārutaḥ. ”

00:23:45.534 --> 00:23:50.544
He said this cannot be killed. This eternal
life cannot be killed by any instrument.

00:23:50.568 --> 00:23:53.068
It cannot be killed by any weapon.

00:23:53.068 --> 00:24:00.288
It cannot be sucked in by
any wind or any subtle powers

00:24:00.314 --> 00:24:04.392
and it cannot be destroyed. It’s eternal life.

00:24:04.416 --> 00:24:07.512
So, a life came on this earth to show.

00:24:07.546 --> 00:24:10.046
He is the one who has shown in his life

00:24:10.046 --> 00:24:12.546
that what Krishna has said is correct.

00:24:14.431 --> 00:24:15.691
He came to prove it.

00:24:15.716 --> 00:24:18.216
I wish we had that English so
I could read it out to you.

00:24:18.246 --> 00:24:21.801
It’s clearly written in that,
that He was born to Radha.

00:24:21.801 --> 00:24:26.727
Radha created it. And that within
the egg, she created the egg.

00:24:26.767 --> 00:24:31.152
And out of one egg, She
put all the essences

00:24:31.166 --> 00:24:33.666
of innocence like, you see,

00:24:33.666 --> 00:24:37.979
this is Radha and the egg, you see. (Unclear)

00:24:37.986 --> 00:24:40.956
This is the egg, inside
the egg, it’s like this.

00:24:40.953 --> 00:24:44.013
Then He comes on this earth as Jesus.

00:24:44.043 --> 00:24:47.853
He’s the embodiment of innocence.

00:24:47.873 --> 00:24:49.413
He comes on this earth

00:24:49.429 --> 00:24:54.253
and then you are shown, you are
shown because you have freedom.

00:24:55.323 --> 00:25:01.016
And you may deny, that’s why you
are shown that He is resurrected.

00:25:03.076 --> 00:25:06.006
And you can also get your resurrection

00:25:06.036 --> 00:25:08.256
which is promised to you.

00:25:08.256 --> 00:25:10.756
Now, so many of you have felt it.

00:25:10.756 --> 00:25:12.656
Your rebirth, you’ve felt it.

00:25:12.653 --> 00:25:17.466
This is a unique thing because so
far all the evolution that you had,

00:25:17.466 --> 00:25:22.819
was not, was not at all your rebirth.

00:25:22.849 --> 00:25:24.529
Now, the rebirth has come

00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:28.629
and when the rebirth has
come, you are shown it,

00:25:28.639 --> 00:25:33.196
you know it, you are aware
of it that it happens to you.

00:25:37.176 --> 00:25:40.336
Clear? Is it clear to you?

00:25:40.366 --> 00:25:43.356
So, on this day, as a Sahaja Yogi,

00:25:43.356 --> 00:25:45.322
you have to decide

00:25:45.322 --> 00:25:49.904
we are there, no doubt,
we are definitely there.

00:25:49.934 --> 00:25:52.084
We have entered into
the Kingdom of God

00:25:52.084 --> 00:25:55.434
and that we have to get more people.

00:25:55.444 --> 00:25:57.584
Because they are still
ignorant, they may argue

00:25:57.605 --> 00:26:00.724
or else they may do anything you
see because they are ignorant,

00:26:00.724 --> 00:26:04.674
they haven’t felt it. But
you have to understand,

00:26:04.704 --> 00:26:07.524
you have to understand
that they have to get it.

00:26:07.548 --> 00:26:10.498
They have to get it, it is their right.

00:26:10.508 --> 00:26:13.798
But they have to ask it
in their own freedom.

00:26:13.798 --> 00:26:16.298
So, you have to tell them,
you have to talk to them,

00:26:16.298 --> 00:26:18.798
you have to find them. There are many,

00:26:18.798 --> 00:26:22.948
so many of them who
are really seeking

00:26:22.978 --> 00:26:25.478
and it should happen to them.

00:26:25.478 --> 00:26:31.012
I have told, long time back,
that the All-pervading Power

00:26:31.012 --> 00:26:36.005
that is on this earth now is
ignited and it’s going to work out.

00:26:36.015 --> 00:26:38.775
You don’t have to worry about how many
people Mother you are going to face,

00:26:38.775 --> 00:26:41.445
how many people that are
going to be, only ten thousand?

00:26:41.445 --> 00:26:42.680
Only twenty thousand?

00:26:42.725 --> 00:26:45.890
No, it’s going to work
out in a very big way.

00:26:45.915 --> 00:26:49.375
But the big way has to be

00:26:49.395 --> 00:26:55.454
done when you people, you the supporters,

00:26:55.494 --> 00:27:01.104
you the...  what you call, the pillars of
that, have to be a little strong with it.

00:27:01.104 --> 00:27:03.344
You have to be little more strong,

00:27:03.364 --> 00:27:06.396
then you can bear the
whole load of that.

00:27:07.735 --> 00:27:11.216
You see, how do we
build a big canopy?

00:27:11.236 --> 00:27:14.970
First, you make the pillars; strong ones

00:27:14.986 --> 00:27:17.740
and then you just spread
the tarp and it’s done!

00:27:19.231 --> 00:27:23.661
So the all-pervading Power will be
enlightening many people on its own.

00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:26.981
But you are like the pillars

00:27:26.981 --> 00:27:30.281
because you will know each and
everything about Kundalini awakening.

00:27:30.281 --> 00:27:32.781
You may know all the manoeuvring
they will just feel it,

00:27:32.781 --> 00:27:34.531
you see, they will talk
about it, their vibrations,

00:27:34.541 --> 00:27:37.716
they will test what is that, they
will be finding it like scientists,

00:27:40.015 --> 00:27:42.515
Like a person who enters into
the room, which is dark,

00:27:42.515 --> 00:27:45.015
he floats on then he will
be going on like that.

00:27:45.015 --> 00:27:48.995
But you are in a room
which is enlightened.

00:27:49.015 --> 00:27:52.655
But you have to be strong
enough to carry that light.

00:27:55.318 --> 00:27:59.328
All right? What I’m saying, this
is what you have to decide

00:27:59.328 --> 00:28:02.378
those who are Realized
have to decide this

00:28:02.398 --> 00:28:04.898
that we have to be really
strong within ourselves.

00:28:04.898 --> 00:28:07.398
Sort out our personal
problems, not only talking.

00:28:07.398 --> 00:28:09.898
How many husbands you
married in last lives,

00:28:09.898 --> 00:28:12.968
how many wives you have had in
last lives, how many children,

00:28:12.988 --> 00:28:17.398
all kinds of nonsensical things this melodrama
and poetry and all that is all nonsense.

00:28:17.398 --> 00:28:20.578
That is not going to give you any
happiness and joy don’t waste your time

00:28:20.578 --> 00:28:23.078
on all these small
things of life. No.

00:28:23.078 --> 00:28:25.578
Stopping and forgiving yourself.

00:28:26.318 --> 00:28:28.288
I come from Saudi Arabia

00:28:28.288 --> 00:28:28.828
From?

00:28:28.858 --> 00:28:30.458
Saudi Arabia

00:28:30.458 --> 00:28:33.572
From Saudi Arabia. They phoned.

00:28:34.718 --> 00:28:37.218
If you like to come.

00:28:38.672 --> 00:28:42.597
Ah. So,

00:28:42.597 --> 00:28:45.097
I would like to have some questions
and we’ll give Realization.

00:28:45.097 --> 00:28:47.597
That’s the way. Who’s there?

00:28:53.017 --> 00:28:54.949
You were there for that?

00:28:54.981 --> 00:28:57.089
Yyou were there for (unclear)

00:28:57.089 --> 00:28:59.589
Ah, I knew he would
come today. I mean.

00:28:59.589 --> 00:29:03.860
You see, he’s looking
so different. Isn’t he?

00:29:03.879 --> 00:29:05.610
So much different.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.740
We’re waiting, you see, for you.

00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:16.237
There’s another one and the one who is
sitting next to you, she looks young.

00:29:16.237 --> 00:29:18.737
Good.

00:29:24.267 --> 00:29:26.767
How are you? What do you find?

00:29:26.803 --> 00:29:28.077
He wanted to come.

00:29:28.083 --> 00:29:30.203
Really? I’m happy.

00:29:30.227 --> 00:29:31.177
And your daughter?

00:29:31.177 --> 00:29:33.677
He doesn’t understand English so much.

00:29:33.677 --> 00:29:36.177
All right, it’s fine, doesn’t matter.

00:29:36.177 --> 00:29:37.218
I can later on explain.

00:29:37.218 --> 00:29:41.178
Can you explain? But this
is a language of love.

00:29:43.418 --> 00:29:46.300
Nothing to be told about
it, it just works, isn’t it?

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.290
Let me see his vibrations now, how is he.

00:29:49.290 --> 00:29:52.510
Can you come down here? Those who
are not yet realised, please...
