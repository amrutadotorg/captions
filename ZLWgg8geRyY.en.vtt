00:00:08.711 --> 00:00:11.845
So now there has to be a method

00:00:11.925 --> 00:00:17.847
that automatically gives you a balance 
as well as a good ascent

00:00:17.927 --> 00:00:24.143
and a happy landings into the Kingdom of God.

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.108
That has to happen.

00:00:28.506 --> 00:00:33.685
Now, you are all built-in that way, this is
what it is,

00:00:33.765 --> 00:00:38.012
but again you don’t have that faith in Me, 
neither in what we are saying.

00:00:38.093 --> 00:00:42.357
Because again: “I believe in Mataji,”
there are many who finish with that.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:50.215
You have to have faith in your Self, 
in your Spirit, by experiencing it.

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:57.688
It’s a something, a dynamic thing that has
to happen within you – a tremendous thing.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.482
It’s nothing something, just your mental
belief that,

00:01:01.562 --> 00:01:06.194
“Today we are communist, tomorrow we 
are capitalist,” and third day something else.

00:01:06.275 --> 00:01:14.066
It’s something that has to become, 
again I say "become," and again "become".

00:01:15.653 --> 00:01:21.695
And that becoming is now.

00:01:22.371 --> 00:01:24.078
The time has come.

00:01:24.816 --> 00:01:32.557
This is the resurrection time; this is the
Last Judgment, believe it or not.

00:01:32.638 --> 00:01:37.326
There is not going to be 
another time for that.

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:47.786
This is the way we are going to be judged:
our maturity, our balance, our capacity.

00:01:47.952 --> 00:01:58.629
Many people come to our meetings, few get
their realization, or many get their realization

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.995
– makes no difference to Me, to anyone or
to Sahaja Yog or to you.

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:10.379
Because if there are seeds which are 
just sprouted and are wasted;

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.471
they are wasted as if they are not sprouted.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.411
They do not grow.

00:02:19.877 --> 00:02:33.268
They are just like any other seeds 
which have not been touched by the Divine.

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:40.348
Even if you get realization, which is
now quite easy for people to get to,

00:02:40.428 --> 00:02:44.619
they are for it, because the Divine is anxious,

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:50.584
because your Creator is anxious,
 to manifest itself,

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:59.581
but to settle down as a realized soul 
is difficult.

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:04.374
I have to tell you at the very outset

00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:12.500
that if you have to mature into it 
you have to understand yourself.

00:03:12.637 --> 00:03:15.375
You must have your self-esteem.

00:03:15.456 --> 00:03:18.684
If you just are here for a shopping,

00:03:18.764 --> 00:03:24.216
“Oh, all right, let’s hear Mother also,” 
that’s not the way it is going to work out.

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:30.932
If you are people of that caliber, 
   then only you can ascend.

00:03:31.513 --> 00:03:33.389
There’s nothing else needed of you.

00:03:33.469 --> 00:03:40.112
You may be a prime minister or you may be
a queen or you may be just a parlor maid,

00:03:40.193 --> 00:03:43.629
makes no difference to the Divine.

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:48.085
You may be a socialist, communist or a capitalist,
makes no difference.

00:03:48.177 --> 00:03:52.719
You may be this color, that color, makes no
difference.

00:03:53.152 --> 00:03:59.016
But you have to have the caliber of a true
seeker,

00:03:59.096 --> 00:04:02.510
who is intelligent enough to see

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:10.219
that he has not come on this earth 
just to be wasted.

00:04:10.553 --> 00:04:15.920
If you make many instruments 
and if they are just wasted,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.616
they are not put to the mains,
 they are good for nothing,

00:04:19.696 --> 00:04:21.886
they have very loose connections,

00:04:21.966 --> 00:04:28.768
He’ll just say, “Cancel all these. Stop this factory.

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:32.857
There’s no use having any more creations.”

00:04:34.008 --> 00:04:40.841
Only those who are matured enough, 
who have self-esteem

00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:43.673
– even age, you’ll be surprised, does not matter –

00:04:43.753 --> 00:04:48.633
I have seen people who are eighty 
years of age could be very stupid,

00:04:48.713 --> 00:04:56.037
and people who are very young, very small
children also, could be great.

00:04:56.117 --> 00:05:05.619
So it is the inner quality of a person, his
maturity, that matters in Sahaj Yoga.

00:05:05.899 --> 00:05:11.736
I know it is rather difficult to understand

00:05:11.816 --> 00:05:17.980
that why, if it is Sahaja, if the Kundalini
 rises so easily in us,

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.339
why is it we take time to establish ourselves?

00:05:24.795 --> 00:05:28.261
The reason is very simple.

00:05:28.341 --> 00:05:34.376
We are not simple people, we are not, 
we are very complicated,

00:05:34.456 --> 00:05:39.749
we have complicated our lives 
with so many problems.
