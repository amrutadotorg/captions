00:16:54.528 --> 00:17:02.038
I’m telling them that how a Sahaja Yogi should
feel.

00:17:04.166 --> 00:17:09.651
You should be satisfied people. Firstly and foremost

00:17:09.874 --> 00:17:12.866
you have to be satisfied.

00:17:14.373 --> 00:17:16.330
You just see within yourself

00:17:16.330 --> 00:17:18.477
if you are satisfied or not.

00:17:19.004 --> 00:17:23.011
You’ve got the highest that you wanted,

00:17:23.399 --> 00:17:28.176
you have got the peace, you’ve got the joy,

00:17:28.477 --> 00:17:31.718
and all the blessings of the Divine.

00:17:31.982 --> 00:17:35.634
Despite that, if you are dissatisfied,

00:17:35.916 --> 00:17:42.389
you want to do something always that is disturbing.

00:17:43.844 --> 00:17:48.107
Always some people want to show Me off,

00:17:48.201 --> 00:17:50.397
want to come forward.

00:17:50.397 --> 00:17:55.440
Or they want to escape Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:55.986 --> 00:17:59.242
Firstly, you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:02.812
How many people have you brought to Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:02.812 --> 00:18:04.818
Just think of it!

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.536
We are Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis means what?

00:18:07.536 --> 00:18:09.798
You are saints!

00:18:10.043 --> 00:18:12.636
In this world, all the saints,

00:18:12.636 --> 00:18:16.163
who became saints with very great difficulty,

00:18:16.558 --> 00:18:19.830
going through lots of tortures,

00:18:19.924 --> 00:18:22.267
have done so much work.

00:18:22.399 --> 00:18:28.099
One single saint has so many people

00:18:28.099 --> 00:18:30.175
whom they have attracted.

00:18:30.288 --> 00:18:33.336
Of course, he couldn’t give them Realisation,

00:18:33.399 --> 00:18:36.373
because I have taught you how to do that.

00:18:37.248 --> 00:18:44.182
But you just find out what are you doing about Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:51.677 --> 00:18:55.388
Only meditation is not the point.

00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.083
Meditation for what?

00:18:58.177 --> 00:19:02.229
For equipping yourself to help others.

00:19:02.229 --> 00:19:09.025
We need it very much in this Kali Yuga, people
who will go all out to help.

00:19:09.138 --> 00:19:16.980
On the contrary, I find that they are very anxious just
to meet Me, to see Me.

00:19:17.596 --> 00:19:22.549
I have seen all the Indians who come to Cabella must meet Me,

00:19:22.888 --> 00:19:26.590
must see Me, as if they have a special right with Me.

00:19:26.778 --> 00:19:31.685
What is the need? What is the need
to meet Me?

00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:36.787
But this is the trouble of, say, our conditioning,

00:19:36.938 --> 00:19:41.136
that supposing there is some leader, some Minister coming,

00:19:41.136 --> 00:19:47.970
everybody will go and show off, like to meet
him and talk to him – but not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:19:48.215 --> 00:19:51.166
You must have self-esteem.

00:19:51.354 --> 00:19:56.339
Self-esteem by which you should know what is your dignity

00:19:56.508 --> 00:19:59.509
and how you should be.

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:05.731
There are Sahaja Yogis who are excellent, who are very good, who are very self satisfied,

00:20:05.731 --> 00:20:07.426
I know who they are.

00:20:07.539 --> 00:20:12.540
And you have to be like that, otherwise you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:12.672 --> 00:20:21.533
You are like all other people trying to indulge into all nonsensical activities.

00:20:22.682 --> 00:20:26.812
Now this is it. Today, it was a real test,

00:20:26.906 --> 00:20:29.309
because I just couldn’t come earlier.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:33.742
You know what is the traffic nowadays, I just couldn’t arrive.

00:20:34.006 --> 00:20:36.349
And still, you were sitting here.

00:20:36.349 --> 00:20:44.918
This gives me great satisfaction that they really love Me, and they are really Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:45.219 --> 00:20:50.341
If you really love Me, you must love others, who are not Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:50.567 --> 00:20:53.082
and try to give them Realisation.

00:20:53.195 --> 00:20:58.366
Because you know, my age is quite a lot, and how far can I go?

00:20:58.535 --> 00:21:03.624
I am not going now to many countries, but Sahaja Yoga is growing fast.

00:21:03.624 --> 00:21:07.548
Though I am not going there, it is growing. Why?

00:21:07.642 --> 00:21:12.888
Because people of that country understand their responsibility.

00:21:12.982 --> 00:21:15.679
You should know what is your responsibility.

00:21:15.679 --> 00:21:21.204
It is not only towards yourself, but it is for the rest of the world.

00:21:21.204 --> 00:21:24.891
You have to work it out and do something about it.

00:21:24.985 --> 00:21:32.320
Whatever people you can approach,
or whatever people you can meet, go all out!

00:21:32.464 --> 00:21:38.355
I have also said before that I have seen people who go to some horrible gurus,

00:21:38.694 --> 00:21:42.842
go on talking about their guru, describing their guru.

00:21:43.028 --> 00:21:48.406
Anybody who meets them, they go on telling them. Not Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:48.594 --> 00:21:54.118
I don’t know, maybe they want to preserve
their Realisation.

00:21:54.589 --> 00:21:58.761
They think if they tell somebody, their Realisation will drop out.

00:21:59.344 --> 00:22:01.968
If you don’t spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:01.968 --> 00:22:05.524
what is the use of getting your Realisation?

00:22:06.597 --> 00:22:10.706
All my labour is wasted on such people,

00:22:10.876 --> 00:22:12.739
who are for themselves.

00:22:12.739 --> 00:22:15.294
They want something for themselves.

00:22:15.426 --> 00:22:19.368
Now for example, so many girls wanted to marry.

00:22:19.877 --> 00:22:24.394
There are four times more, five times more than
all the boys put together.

00:22:25.222 --> 00:22:29.308
But if they are not married, they feel very unhappy about it.

00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:31.716
Doesn’t matter!

00:22:32.243 --> 00:22:36.921
You are now connected to God.

00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:40.813
Marriage is not always a very great blessing.

00:22:40.888 --> 00:22:42.198
I tell you,

00:22:42.198 --> 00:22:45.549
it’s not. On the contrary, it can be very binding.

00:22:45.719 --> 00:22:47.712
It could be very troublesome.

00:22:47.712 --> 00:22:49.921
So better not feel bad.

00:22:50.147 --> 00:22:51.527
You should feel bad

00:22:51.527 --> 00:22:54.875
when you cannot give Realisations to others.

00:22:55.063 --> 00:22:57.918
"How many people have I given Realisation?"

00:22:57.918 --> 00:22:59.456
Just think about it.

00:22:59.701 --> 00:23:05.124
All the time, like all the ordinary people, thinking about marriage,

00:23:05.124 --> 00:23:06.929
and this and that.

00:23:06.929 --> 00:23:08.737
It’s not going to help you.

00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:11.065
You are something special.

00:23:11.065 --> 00:23:13.617
And what speciality do you have?

00:23:13.617 --> 00:23:16.040
What are you doing about it?

00:23:16.435 --> 00:23:23.925
I’m sorry at the end of this, our great Ganapatipule, I have to tell you this.

00:23:24.396 --> 00:23:30.218
But sometimes one has to tell, also.

00:23:31.084 --> 00:23:34.043
I know you are all, all very good Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:34.043 --> 00:23:36.598
Also, that you have achieved so much.

00:23:36.730 --> 00:23:41.804
But what is my desire is that all of you should become like a light

00:23:42.087 --> 00:23:44.548
and start spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:44.699 --> 00:23:48.490
In some countries it has happened, it is working out.

00:23:48.490 --> 00:23:51.101
And people feel so responsible!

00:23:51.233 --> 00:23:55.550
I am amazed at them, how they are spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:55.964 --> 00:23:59.220
Now the same request, I have to make to you,

00:23:59.559 --> 00:24:05.510
that please, look at yourself, introspect: what have you done?

00:24:06.037 --> 00:24:09.028
What have you achieved in Sahaja Yoga?

00:24:09.028 --> 00:24:19.100
Such a satisfaction lies when you really, when
you really work hard to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:19.477 --> 00:24:25.404
Many people think that coming nearer Me I feel
pleased. I am not.

00:24:27.199 --> 00:24:29.770
That’s no recognition.

00:24:29.996 --> 00:24:32.478
You should never do that.

00:24:32.647 --> 00:24:35.725
On the contrary, when you will grow really,

00:24:35.725 --> 00:24:38.196
I will know myself.

00:24:38.591 --> 00:24:41.864
Today is not the day I should have said all this,

00:24:41.939 --> 00:24:47.028
because it is the day for New Year’s Day.

00:24:47.310 --> 00:24:52.670
But only good decisions are to be taken

00:24:52.670 --> 00:24:56.959
on the New Year’s Day, that’s the custom with human beings.

00:24:57.204 --> 00:25:03.642
So today you all have to take the decision
that, "What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?

00:25:03.981 --> 00:25:06.602
What are we giving to Sahaja Yoga?

00:25:06.602 --> 00:25:08.970
What is our achievement?

00:25:08.970 --> 00:25:11.187
Are we sharing with others?"

00:25:11.244 --> 00:25:15.238
It’s the greatest truth you have got. Nobody got
it.

00:25:15.426 --> 00:25:17.932
People worked so hard, did so much.

00:25:18.026 --> 00:25:20.269
Nobody could give Realisation.

00:25:20.382 --> 00:25:23.416
It’s only you who can give Realisation, very surprising.

00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:26.914
Kabir could not give Realisation to anybody.

00:25:26.914 --> 00:25:30.421
Gyanadeva could not give Realisation to anybody.

00:25:30.515 --> 00:25:36.889
All of them have been great, great Saints of great value system,

00:25:36.889 --> 00:25:39.367
and with great understanding.

00:25:39.461 --> 00:25:43.627
Whatever poetry they have given, people are singing, that’s all.

00:25:43.928 --> 00:25:50.990
But they cannot give Self-realisation which you can do.

00:25:52.028 --> 00:25:55.681
With all that power, if you are not giving Realisation,

00:25:55.907 --> 00:25:58.994
what’s the use of giving power to someone like that?

00:26:00.761 --> 00:26:07.207
So today’s New Year’s message is that,

00:26:07.904 --> 00:26:12.947
next year, you must give Self-realisation to
many people.

00:26:13.813 --> 00:26:16.878
How many people have you given Self-realisation?

00:26:17.066 --> 00:26:18.959
That’s the main thing.

00:26:19.091 --> 00:26:21.203
Just find out.

00:26:23.178 --> 00:26:26.382
What have you done throughout the year?

00:26:26.608 --> 00:26:29.933
But I don’t know how to count it.

00:26:30.366 --> 00:26:35.648
But you, yourself count. ‘What have we done all these years?’

00:26:35.836 --> 00:26:38.537
‘What have we achieved?’

00:26:39.177 --> 00:26:43.329
Attending my puja is no favour to Me.

00:26:44.328 --> 00:26:49.369
Or doing anything for the puja is no favour to
Me.

00:26:49.727 --> 00:26:53.679
My greatest puja is that of human beings.

00:26:53.905 --> 00:26:59.117
And if you can achieve and spread Sahaja Yoga
that fast,

00:26:59.874 --> 00:27:03.040
I’ll be very, very grateful to you.

00:27:03.266 --> 00:27:07.425
I have worked very hard, I have really worked
very hard.

00:27:07.745 --> 00:27:16.393
This body, this mind, all my health, everything, I have done for saving people.

00:27:16.638 --> 00:27:21.051
And you please also tonight decide and take a view

00:27:21.051 --> 00:27:26.023
that, "What Mother is saying is very important and precious.

00:27:26.287 --> 00:27:31.908
We have to, we have to rise and give Realisation to people".

00:27:32.303 --> 00:27:36.015
But which is not so common.

00:27:36.683 --> 00:27:43.831
I am surprised why people are behaving in this manner who are Realised souls.

00:27:44.208 --> 00:27:50.705
All my blessings for the New Year, for all of you ‘Happy New Year’!

00:27:51.063 --> 00:27:58.032
But next year should be full of many Sahaja Yogis,

00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:04.322
who have done work and who have achieved something great.

00:28:04.812 --> 00:28:06.576
May God bless you
