00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:43.639
I’m telling them that how a Sahaja Yogi should 
feel.

00:00:45.767 --> 00:00:51.252
You should be satisfied people. Firstly and foremost

00:00:51.475 --> 00:00:54.467
you have to be satisfied.

00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:57.931
You just see within yourself

00:00:57.931 --> 00:01:00.078
if you are satisfied or not.

00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:04.612
You’ve got the highest that you wanted,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.777
you have got the peace, you’ve got the joy,

00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:13.319
and all the blessings of the Divine.

00:01:13.583 --> 00:01:17.235
Despite that, if you are dissatisfied,

00:01:17.517 --> 00:01:23.990
you want to do something always that is disturbing.

00:01:25.445 --> 00:01:29.708
Always some people want to show Me off,

00:01:29.802 --> 00:01:31.998
want to come forward.

00:01:31.998 --> 00:01:37.041
Or they want to escape Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:37.587 --> 00:01:40.843
Firstly, you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:44.413
How many people have you brought to Sahaja Yoga?

00:01:44.413 --> 00:01:46.419
Just think of it!

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.137
We are Sahaja Yogis. Sahaja Yogis means what?

00:01:49.137 --> 00:01:51.399
You are saints!

00:01:51.644 --> 00:01:54.237
In this world, all the saints,

00:01:54.237 --> 00:01:57.764
who became saints with very great difficulty,

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.431
going through lots of tortures,

00:02:01.525 --> 00:02:03.868
have done so much work.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.700
One single saint has so many people

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.776
whom they have attracted.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.937
Of course, he couldn’t give them Realisation,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.974
because I have taught you how to do that.

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:25.783
But you just find out what are you doing about Sahaja Yoga?

00:02:33.278 --> 00:02:36.989
Only meditation is not the point.

00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:39.684
Meditation for what?

00:02:39.778 --> 00:02:43.830
For equipping yourself to help others.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:50.626
We need it very much in this Kali Yuga, people 
who will go all out to help.

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:58.581
On the contrary, I find that they are very anxious just 
to meet Me, to see Me.

00:02:59.197 --> 00:03:04.150
I have seen all the Indians who come to Cabella must meet Me,

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.191
must see Me, as if they have a special right with Me.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.286
What is the need? What is the need 
to meet Me?

00:03:13.437 --> 00:03:18.388
But this is the trouble of, say, our conditioning,

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:22.737
that supposing there is some leader, some Minister coming,

00:03:22.737 --> 00:03:29.571
everybody will go and show off, like to meet 
him and talk to him – but not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:32.767
You must have self-esteem.

00:03:32.955 --> 00:03:37.940
Self-esteem by which you should know what is your dignity

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:41.110
and how you should be.

00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:47.332
There are Sahaja Yogis who are excellent, who are very good, who are very self satisfied,

00:03:47.332 --> 00:03:49.027
I know who they are.

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.141
And you have to be like that, otherwise you cannot enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:54.273 --> 00:04:03.134
You are like all other people trying to indulge into all nonsensical activities.

00:04:04.283 --> 00:04:08.413
Now this is it. Today, it was a real test,

00:04:08.507 --> 00:04:10.910
because I just couldn’t come earlier.

00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:15.343
You know what is the traffic nowadays, I just couldn’t arrive.

00:04:15.607 --> 00:04:17.950
And still, you were sitting here.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:26.519
This gives me great satisfaction that they really love Me, and they are really Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:31.942
If you really love Me, you must love others, who are not Sahaja Yogis,

00:04:32.168 --> 00:04:34.683
and try to give them Realisation.

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:39.967
Because you know, my age is quite a lot, and how far can I go?

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:45.225
I am not going now to many countries, but Sahaja Yoga is growing fast.

00:04:45.225 --> 00:04:49.149
Though I am not going there, it is growing. Why?

00:04:49.243 --> 00:04:54.489
Because people of that country understand their responsibility.

00:04:54.583 --> 00:04:57.280
You should know what is your responsibility.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.805
It is not only towards yourself, but it is for the rest of the world.

00:05:02.805 --> 00:05:06.492
You have to work it out and do something about it.

00:05:06.586 --> 00:05:13.921
Whatever people you can approach, 
or whatever people you can meet, go all out!

00:05:14.065 --> 00:05:19.956
I have also said before that I have seen people who go to some horrible gurus,

00:05:20.295 --> 00:05:24.443
go on talking about their guru, describing their guru.

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:30.007
Anybody who meets them, they go on telling them. Not Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:30.195 --> 00:05:35.719
I don’t know, maybe they want to preserve 
their Realisation.

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:40.362
They think if they tell somebody, their Realisation will drop out. 

00:05:40.945 --> 00:05:43.569
If you don’t spread Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.125
what is the use of getting your Realisation?

00:05:48.198 --> 00:05:52.307
All my labour is wasted on such people,

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:54.340
who are for themselves.

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.895
They want something for themselves.

00:05:57.027 --> 00:06:00.969
Now for example, so many girls wanted to marry.

00:06:01.478 --> 00:06:05.995
There are four times more, five times more than 
all the boys put together.

00:06:06.823 --> 00:06:10.909
But if they are not married, they feel very unhappy about it.

00:06:11.041 --> 00:06:13.317
Doesn’t matter!

00:06:13.844 --> 00:06:18.522
You are now connected to God.

00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.414
Marriage is not always a very great blessing.

00:06:22.489 --> 00:06:23.799
I tell you,

00:06:23.799 --> 00:06:27.150
it’s not. On the contrary, it can be very binding.

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.313
It could be very troublesome.

00:06:29.313 --> 00:06:31.522
So better not feel bad.

00:06:31.748 --> 00:06:33.128
You should feel bad

00:06:33.128 --> 00:06:36.476
when you cannot give Realisations to others.

00:06:36.664 --> 00:06:39.519
"How many people have I given Realisation?"

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:41.057
Just think about it.

00:06:41.302 --> 00:06:46.725
All the time, like all the ordinary people, thinking about marriage,

00:06:46.725 --> 00:06:48.530
and this and that.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:50.338
It’s not going to help you.

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:52.666
You are something special.

00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:55.218
And what speciality do you have?

00:06:55.218 --> 00:06:57.641
What are you doing about it?

00:06:58.036 --> 00:07:05.526
I’m sorry at the end of this, our great Ganapatipule, I have to tell you this.

00:07:05.997 --> 00:07:11.819
But sometimes one has to tell, also.

00:07:12.685 --> 00:07:15.644
I know you are all, all very good Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:15.644 --> 00:07:18.199
Also, that you have achieved so much.

00:07:18.331 --> 00:07:23.405
But what is my desire is that all of you should become like a light

00:07:23.688 --> 00:07:26.149
and start spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.091
In some countries it has happened, it is working out.

00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:32.702
And people feel so responsible!

00:07:32.834 --> 00:07:37.151
I am amazed at them, how they are spreading Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:40.821
Now the same request, I have to make to you,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:47.111
that please, look at yourself, introspect: what have you done?

00:07:47.638 --> 00:07:50.629
What have you achieved in Sahaja Yoga?

00:07:50.629 --> 00:08:00.701
Such a satisfaction lies when you really, when 
you really work hard to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:01.078 --> 00:08:07.005
Many people think that coming nearer Me I feel 
pleased. I am not.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.371
That’s no recognition.

00:08:11.597 --> 00:08:14.079
You should never do that.

00:08:14.248 --> 00:08:17.326
On the contrary, when you will grow really,

00:08:17.326 --> 00:08:19.797
I will know myself.

00:08:20.192 --> 00:08:23.465
Today is not the day I should have said all this,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:28.629
because it is the day for New Year’s Day.

00:08:28.911 --> 00:08:34.271
But only good decisions are to be taken

00:08:34.271 --> 00:08:38.560
on the New Year’s Day, that’s the custom with human beings.

00:08:38.805 --> 00:08:45.243
So today you all have to take the decision 
that, "What are we doing for Sahaja Yoga?

00:08:45.582 --> 00:08:48.203
What are we giving to Sahaja Yoga?

00:08:48.203 --> 00:08:50.571
What is our achievement?

00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.788
Are we sharing with others?"

00:08:52.845 --> 00:08:56.839
It’s the greatest truth you have got. Nobody got 
it.

00:08:57.027 --> 00:08:59.533
People worked so hard, did so much.

00:08:59.627 --> 00:09:01.870
Nobody could give Realisation.

00:09:01.983 --> 00:09:05.017
It’s only you who can give Realisation, very surprising.

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:08.515
Kabir could not give Realisation to anybody.

00:09:08.515 --> 00:09:12.022
Gyanadeva could not give Realisation to anybody.

00:09:12.116 --> 00:09:18.490
All of them have been great, great Saints of great value system,

00:09:18.490 --> 00:09:20.968
and with great understanding.

00:09:21.062 --> 00:09:25.228
Whatever poetry they have given, people are singing, that’s all.

00:09:25.529 --> 00:09:32.591
But they cannot give Self-realisation which you can do.

00:09:33.629 --> 00:09:37.282
With all that power, if you are not giving Realisation,

00:09:37.508 --> 00:09:40.595
what’s the use of giving power to someone like that?

00:09:42.362 --> 00:09:48.808
So today’s New Year’s message is that,

00:09:49.505 --> 00:09:54.548
next year, you must give Self-realisation to 
many people.

00:09:55.414 --> 00:09:58.479
How many people have you given Self-realisation?

00:09:58.667 --> 00:10:00.560
That’s the main thing.

00:10:00.692 --> 00:10:02.804
Just find out.

00:10:04.779 --> 00:10:07.983
What have you done throughout the year?

00:10:08.209 --> 00:10:11.534
But I don’t know how to count it.

00:10:11.967 --> 00:10:17.249
But you, yourself count. ‘What have we done all these years?’

00:10:17.437 --> 00:10:20.138
‘What have we achieved?’

00:10:20.778 --> 00:10:24.930
Attending my puja is no favour to Me.

00:10:25.929 --> 00:10:30.970
Or doing anything for the puja is no favour to 
Me.

00:10:31.328 --> 00:10:35.280
My greatest puja is that of human beings.

00:10:35.506 --> 00:10:40.718
And if you can achieve and spread Sahaja Yoga 
that fast,

00:10:41.475 --> 00:10:44.641
I’ll be very, very grateful to you.

00:10:44.867 --> 00:10:49.026
I have worked very hard, I have really worked 
very hard.

00:10:49.346 --> 00:10:57.994
This body, this mind, all my health, everything, I have done for saving people.

00:10:58.239 --> 00:11:02.652
And you please also tonight decide and take a view

00:11:02.652 --> 00:11:07.624
that, "What Mother is saying is very important and precious.

00:11:07.888 --> 00:11:13.509
We have to, we have to rise and give Realisation to people".

00:11:13.904 --> 00:11:17.616
But which is not so common.

00:11:18.284 --> 00:11:25.432
I am surprised why people are behaving in this manner who are Realised souls.

00:11:25.809 --> 00:11:32.306
All my blessings for the New Year, for all of you ‘Happy New Year’!

00:11:32.664 --> 00:11:39.633
But next year should be full of many Sahaja Yogis,

00:11:39.821 --> 00:11:45.923
who have done work and who have achieved something great.

00:11:46.413 --> 00:11:48.177
May God bless you
