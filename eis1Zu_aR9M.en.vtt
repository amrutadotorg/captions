00:11.477 --> 00:16.295
So it’s very nice to arrive here among all of you and

00:17.562 --> 00:21.532
I’m sorry for what has happened before My coming here.

00:22.085 --> 00:27.054
But, as I also told you that nature also

00:27.437 --> 00:32.464
can be awakened with the presence of a Divine personality,

00:32.505 --> 00:36.646
and once it is awakened it starts behaving in a manner,

00:36.847 --> 00:39.123
as a realized soul would do.

00:41.382 --> 00:49.761
Like it gets angry with people who are not religious,

00:49.882 --> 00:53.019
people who don’t want to know about God,

00:53.140 --> 00:55.875
people who are doing wrong things on life,

00:55.996 --> 00:59.344
people who are not normal people,

00:59.465 --> 01:04.242
in the sense they don’t want to be part and parcel of the whole,

01:04.363 --> 01:06.909
recluses, all sorts of people.

01:07.030 --> 01:13.430
And once it is brought to that level then it starts working on its own.

01:13.992 --> 01:16.968
As you know that according to Sahaja Yoga

01:17.089 --> 01:21.379
all these elements have got a deity behind it.

01:21.500 --> 01:25.883
For example, agni has got a deity called Agni Devata.

01:26.004 --> 01:31.641
In pure form Agni Devata is the one, which really purifies us.

01:31.842 --> 01:35.406
It purifies everything, it purifies say a gold,

01:35.527 --> 01:38.523
if you put gold in the fire it doesn’t burn,

01:38.644 --> 01:41.610
it comes out more brilliant, better.

01:41.777 --> 01:47.179
But if it is something that is not of such a value it will burn off.

01:47.299 --> 01:50.318
So all inflammable things are mostly

01:50.439 --> 01:55.063
of a low-grade things, which are to be burned only.

01:55.262 --> 01:58.947
But amazingly these lower things only

01:59.068 --> 02:02.402
when they are enlightened or you can say,

02:02.523 --> 02:08.084
when you put some wood, you take and you put fire to it,

02:08.205 --> 02:11.440
so when fire is added to that wood

02:11.560 --> 02:16.833
the same fire which is coming, actually the base is that wood itself,

02:17.068 --> 02:22.944
it is inflammable, and the flames that are coming out of that fire,

02:23.065 --> 02:26.133
once they are enlightened

02:26.254 --> 02:31.610
they start knowing what is truth, what is untruth.

02:31.780 --> 02:36.660
Or reacting in such a manner as if they know it, what work has to be done.

02:36.781 --> 02:41.054
Now the difference between a Sahaja Yogi and the fire,

02:41.175 --> 02:48.337
which is so initiated, is this, that it does not think about it.

02:49.156 --> 02:53.726
It just goes on completely finishing things, which it has to do.

02:53.998 --> 02:59.530
And by a method of frequencies it knows where to go and which one to burn off.

02:59.651 --> 03:04.640
And that’s how it goes on burning things, which it has to burn.

03:04.761 --> 03:09.183
And some of the unfortunate things are

03:09.304 --> 03:14.179
that people feel that this fire has no compassion

03:14.319 --> 03:19.507
and that the fire must have some compassion also to spare some people.

03:19.628 --> 03:25.174
But the trouble is we must understand that we have so many things within us.

03:25.315 --> 03:28.990
We’ve got fire, we’ve got water, we’ve got Mother Earth

03:29.111 --> 03:30.799
all elements are within us.

03:30.920 --> 03:35.160
But in the fire – it is only the fire element, nothing else.

03:35.281 --> 03:39.721
So it acts according to its own quality, that is fire.

03:40.080 --> 03:44.229
And whatever is the quality of the fire when enlightened,

03:44.350 --> 03:46.880
separates truth from untruth

03:47.000 --> 03:51.380
and starts behaving in that manner, but it remains fire.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.746
It cannot become compassion.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.004
But in a way if you see, when you start choosing

03:57.125 --> 04:00.808
between the wrong type of a person and a right type of a person

04:00.929 --> 04:05.250
if you see in a subtle way it is compassion because it is truth,

04:05.371 --> 04:07.117
and truth is love.

04:07.238 --> 04:11.761
So whatever it is doing is to manifest the love of God,

04:11.882 --> 04:14.765
and when it is manifesting the love of God

04:14.886 --> 04:17.343
you should know, that though it is fire

04:17.464 --> 04:20.867
it gets the performance of a personality,

04:20.988 --> 04:24.664
which is as if, is a human being.

04:24.785 --> 04:27.406
Because it is discreet.

04:27.527 --> 04:32.343
It knows what to burn and what not to burn.

04:32.753 --> 04:39.472
One day I must tell you, we were doing some sort of a cleaning of the doors

04:39.593 --> 04:44.875
with those lamps you get and Linda one day you see by mistake,

04:44.996 --> 04:48.574
brought that lamp very close to My body

04:48.695 --> 04:51.918
and the lamp, the flame was very strong,

04:52.039 --> 04:56.570
but it just went round Me, didn’t touch Me.

04:56.691 --> 04:59.265
She was surprised, she said, ” Mother You’re burning."

04:59.386 --> 05:02.328
I said, “Don’t worry,” it just went round and came out.

05:03.339 --> 05:09.218
So the fire doesn’t burn a person who is pure, doesn’t burn.

05:09.339 --> 05:12.885
The example is Sitaji.

05:13.212 --> 05:19.225
Sitaji when She was brought by Shri Rama from Ravana’s place,

05:19.346 --> 05:22.283
you see, everybody said that She has lived with a Rakasha

05:22.404 --> 05:28.307
and She must be found out whether She is guilty or not.

05:28.726 --> 05:33.467
So Rama first of all He said, “All right,” He put the fire.

05:33.588 --> 05:37.897
She Herself said that, “You put a fire, a big pyre of fire,”

05:38.018 --> 05:39.687
and She sat on that.

05:39.972 --> 05:44.612
And when the fire started burning it could not burn Her,

05:44.733 --> 05:48.929
She could not be burnt, you see, and the whole fire subsided.

05:49.050 --> 05:55.038
So that time the Agni Devata knows what is right, what is wrong.

05:55.159 --> 05:58.528
Who is holy, who is unholy.

05:59.033 --> 06:02.768
But human beings take lot of time to recognize that

06:02.889 --> 06:05.003
and to understand, even in Sahaja Yoga,

06:05.124 --> 06:09.071
because the sensitivity has to be grown much more.

06:09.192 --> 06:12.802
Now why is it, that anything that like water,

06:12.923 --> 06:16.268
or Agni or any one of these elements become

06:16.388 --> 06:19.135
so sensitive than human beings are.

06:19.256 --> 06:22.655
How they just obediently do the thing,

06:22.776 --> 06:26.581
as if they know the job and they’re so quick at it, so efficient.

06:26.702 --> 06:31.448
The reason is they are completely under the control of the Divine.

06:31.569 --> 06:38.633
They are under the control of the powers of God, absolutely, hundred percent.

06:38.754 --> 06:43.404
Whatever God wants, they do it, once they are enlightened.

06:43.525 --> 06:46.324
But human beings are still, you see,

06:46.445 --> 06:51.486
dwindling between his own human awareness and the Divine awareness

06:51.606 --> 06:53.418
and the oneness with God.

06:53.538 --> 06:58.048
So it is the sensitivity in a person grows very, very, slowly

06:58.169 --> 07:00.552
– doesn’t matter makes no difference –

07:00.673 --> 07:04.199
and when it grows, it comes you see it moves sometimes,

07:04.320 --> 07:07.852
two steps forwards and five steps backwards, you see again like that.

07:07.973 --> 07:11.379
When the time is about two years, you’ll find a gentleman at the same spot

07:11.500 --> 07:13.301
where he started.

07:13.422 --> 07:17.375
You get quite upset at how it has happened, despite Sahaja Yoga.

07:17.496 --> 07:20.652
But this is the thing is, that human beings can think,

07:20.773 --> 07:24.219
and they can decide, and they have ultimate freedom

07:24.340 --> 07:28.484
to give up this sensitivity at any time.

07:29.018 --> 07:35.312
So you have to be under complete obedience of the Divine,

07:35.433 --> 07:37.969
which is, one cannot understand sometimes

07:38.090 --> 07:41.939
how to be like that because we have not been brought up that way.

07:42.060 --> 07:44.634
We don’t know how to do it and it’s very difficult.

07:44.755 --> 07:47.631
So many people say, “Mother it’s very difficult to surrender."

07:47.752 --> 07:50.265
It’s not that they don’t want to surrender, but they think

07:50.386 --> 07:53.361
that, “We are still you see, there is still ego popping up somewhere,

07:53.482 --> 07:55.870
Mother says something but we start questioning her.

07:55.990 --> 07:59.247
Mother says this, then we think that we should,

07:59.368 --> 08:04.252
we can suggest to Mother there’s another alternative and this and that."

08:04.373 --> 08:08.005
But there’s no alternative, there’s no alternative

08:08.126 --> 08:10.774
for a person who’s a sensible person.

08:10.895 --> 08:14.289
If he knows that Divine is only thinking of your hitha,

08:14.425 --> 08:19.225
of your well-being, and whatever it sees and does, you see,

08:19.346 --> 08:23.588
knows much more than you, much much more.

08:23.709 --> 08:27.127
And in so many dimensions that, if

08:27.248 --> 08:31.311
somebody says so that, “Do like this,” best is to do that.

08:31.432 --> 08:33.733
Sometimes it shocks people.

08:33.918 --> 08:36.599
People have ideas about sympathies,

08:36.720 --> 08:40.513
ideas about being, you see, kind to others,

08:40.634 --> 08:43.229
and compassionate to others.

08:43.430 --> 08:46.966
But what is a human compassion, it doesn’t do anything it just talks.

08:47.087 --> 08:50.480
While the God’s compassion works, it works.

08:50.600 --> 08:55.367
It works on people, it doesn’t talk that, “Oh, I’m very compassionate,

08:55.488 --> 08:59.973
I’m full of compassion,” nothing, it just works, it manifests itself.

09:00.094 --> 09:05.351
So one should understand to be a complete ego-less personality,

09:05.472 --> 09:12.336
one should try to obey the Self within yourself.

09:12.457 --> 09:15.654
Now how do you obey yourself within yourself?

09:15.775 --> 09:18.384
It is through vibratory awareness.

09:19.001 --> 09:22.556
Try to obey through your vibratory awareness.

09:22.677 --> 09:25.822
Any question you want to ask, anything you want to do,

09:25.943 --> 09:30.596
you must obey it through your vibratory awareness.

09:30.717 --> 09:34.255
Now some people are not so sensitive, that’s true.

09:34.376 --> 09:38.331
The reason why they are not sensitive is because they think about it.

09:38.451 --> 09:41.783
Now you think with your brain, all right?

09:41.904 --> 09:44.638
If your brain can be enlightened,

09:44.759 --> 09:49.466
then you will think as the Divine thinks and your sensitivity will improve,

09:49.587 --> 09:53.108
because sensitivity comes from the central nervous system.

09:53.228 --> 09:55.978
Now in the central nervous system if there is any blockage

09:56.099 --> 09:58.029
it is actually in the brain

09:58.150 --> 10:02.033
because all the centers are represented in the brain.

10:02.154 --> 10:04.529
So the best thing is to say that,

10:04.650 --> 10:09.666
“Mother come in my brain. Please reside in my brain.

10:09.787 --> 10:13.186
Please make Your room in this brain.

10:13.306 --> 10:16.106
You be the controller of this brain.

10:16.227 --> 10:19.963
Let this brain be guided by Your divine wisdom."

10:20.084 --> 10:22.162
And you don’t think for yourself,

10:22.283 --> 10:25.970
and this word ‘I think’ should be dropped completely from Sahaja Yogis.

10:26.091 --> 10:29.169
‘I think’ means, goes on you see, in funny ways;

10:29.290 --> 10:31.395
it can be anything, you see.

10:31.516 --> 10:34.292
Like once we went out and we had

10:34.413 --> 10:39.941
one of my very stupid relations staying with us, a girl.

10:40.062 --> 10:43.572
And as I was going out – we had no servants that day,

10:43.694 --> 10:47.147
so I was cooking – but that day when we were going out I said to her,

10:47.268 --> 10:50.936
“I’m going in the morning, so can you make a little bit of khichdi  for us

10:51.057 --> 10:53.568
and when we come back we’ll have it."

10:53.689 --> 10:57.643
That’s the only cooking she did in her lifetime, maybe she did not do also.

10:57.764 --> 11:03.054
So when we came back she told Me that she has not cooked.

11:03.174 --> 11:04.943
So I said, “Why? Why didn’t you cook,

11:05.064 --> 11:07.509
because we were supposed to take our food here."

11:07.630 --> 11:11.799
She said, “I thought that maybe you may not come.

11:11.920 --> 11:15.670
Maybe you’re not hungry, maybe you may not like to eat.

11:15.791 --> 11:17.571
Maybe I may not cook well,”

11:17.692 --> 11:20.766
you see, all these four alternatives not to do the cooking.

11:20.887 --> 11:25.807
But I said, “Why didn’t you think that we may be hungry, that we will eat.

11:25.928 --> 11:27.729
Why didn’t you think this way?”

11:27.853 --> 11:30.869
“But I thought,” you see this is an explanation

11:30.990 --> 11:35.797
for not having one in the brain I should say,

11:35.918 --> 11:40.848
that there is no Divine guidance in the brain.

11:40.969 --> 11:44.576
Then the guidance comes from your ego

11:44.697 --> 11:49.377
or from your superego, which says, “I thought that this might happen."

11:49.497 --> 11:52.194
But how, why, why did you think like that?

11:52.315 --> 11:54.236
Why not the other way round?

11:54.357 --> 11:56.354
Why didn’t you think the other way round?

11:56.475 --> 11:58.502
But that is how it is,

11:58.623 --> 12:02.557
and when these things happen we really are so much used to this

12:02.677 --> 12:07.381
kind of justification and alternatives to be offered,

12:07.501 --> 12:10.278
that this becomes again the habit

12:10.398 --> 12:14.991
of the brain and the brain gets separated from the Divine.

12:15.112 --> 12:18.487
So you tell your brain, “But why, why did you think like that?

12:18.607 --> 12:22.491
Now will you stop thinking about these things on these lines?

12:22.612 --> 12:25.046
Let us think of the positive thinking."

12:25.167 --> 12:27.788
Now positive thinking is nothing but is a thinking

12:27.909 --> 12:30.701
– as according to Sahaja Yoga, is not aggressive thinking,

12:30.822 --> 12:39.859
but it means that a thinking which helps to manifest the Divine.

12:40.268 --> 12:42.346
That is what is positive thinking.

12:45.525 --> 12:50.462
And the result of that is that

12:50.636 --> 12:56.490
your nerves start opening out, and you start feeling

13:00.843 --> 13:07.437
the  manifestations of divine power in your fingers in your being.

13:08.210 --> 13:12.199
And this is the basic thing that doesn’t happen in the West

13:12.320 --> 13:14.783
or in the Western culture because

13:14.904 --> 13:20.038
we have a very big idea of always giving an explanation for anything.

13:20.159 --> 13:22.831
Now you can see that, supposing

13:22.952 --> 13:27.917
you go to a person who is possessed and you get possessed,

13:28.038 --> 13:31.733
then you’ll give an explanation you see, I went to that person

13:31.854 --> 13:36.164
thinking, I thought, that I would cure that person.

13:36.285 --> 13:39.976
But the result is that you are mad now.

13:40.097 --> 13:43.500
Instead of that person getting cured, you get posessed.

13:43.621 --> 13:47.790
So what is the reason? The reason is that you thought in a very negative way,

13:47.911 --> 13:52.110
that, “I thought that this would help me

13:52.231 --> 13:57.486
or I was helping that person”. On the contrary you got into trouble.

13:57.606 --> 14:02.080
Now the trouble did not think,

14:02.200 --> 14:05.893
no, it just entered into you without thinking.

14:06.014 --> 14:09.627
It is there, it never thought “whether I enter this person or not,”

14:09.748 --> 14:13.559
it just came in, walked straight forward.
While you were busy thinking, you see,

14:13.680 --> 14:17.739
it entered into your being and settled down there.

14:17.860 --> 14:23.426
So it’s like a thief

14:23.559 --> 14:27.871
walking into your house nicely when you are busy,

14:27.992 --> 14:32.496
absentmindedly doing something, you see, it’s exactly like this.

14:32.617 --> 14:34.770
You see the thief walking in suddenly you find

14:34.891 --> 14:37.199
Oh, the thief is standing behind you

14:37.320 --> 14:40.166
– now you said, “I was thinking."

14:45.104 --> 14:48.342
Is exactly the same way it happens to us

14:48.463 --> 14:53.108
and when we know, our mind knows, that “I can give an explanation about it."

14:53.229 --> 14:58.897
Every time it is ready to give explanation then the mind, you see,

14:59.018 --> 15:02.702
is used to that kind of a phenomenon,

15:02.823 --> 15:06.706
that it will always give an excuse, always it will say something.

15:06.827 --> 15:09.647
So it is never on the alert, because you see,

15:09.768 --> 15:13.170
even if the trouble walks into you, you’ll always say

15:13.291 --> 15:14.643
“this is the explanation."

15:14.764 --> 15:19.620
But explanation doesn’t cure, doesn’t help you.

15:19.741 --> 15:22.713
Because by mental explanation...

15:23.091 --> 15:28.130
She’s not well, give her some soothing things.

15:35.298 --> 15:42.005
So one should not be extremely on the thought waves

15:42.173 --> 15:44.630
and on depending on their thinking

15:44.751 --> 15:47.583
because, you see, thinking has an alternative.

15:47.704 --> 15:50.653
Thinking always has an alternative.

15:50.774 --> 15:54.743
You can say, ” I was thinking this, or I was thinking that."

15:54.891 --> 15:56.281
But whom are you blaming?

15:56.402 --> 15:59.549
It was you who were thinking so you are responsible for that.

15:59.670 --> 16:03.469
So if you take the responsibility for your thinking,

16:03.610 --> 16:06.227
then you may not do such a thing as to say that,

16:06.348 --> 16:10.837
“I thought, if I had done this thing it would have been better,”

16:11.021 --> 16:14.568
because you are responsible for your thinking.

16:14.688 --> 16:17.121
Supposing an engine driver decides that

16:17.242 --> 16:21.288
“I thought I better go by the other route,” and has a big accident.

16:21.408 --> 16:24.469
People will ask him, “Why did you think like that?

16:24.593 --> 16:27.367
What was the thing that made you think like that?”

16:27.488 --> 16:31.570
But in everyday to day life I find human beings are always saying,

16:31.691 --> 16:37.320
“I think, I think, I think,” all the time giving alternatives

16:37.441 --> 16:42.183
and that’s why they go up and down, up and down, up and down like that.

16:42.304 --> 16:48.226
But for fire, or for water, or for Mother Earth

16:48.347 --> 16:51.733
there is no alternative, no more alternative.

16:51.854 --> 16:55.401
If I just touch the Mother Earth and I say, “Suck in their problems please,”

16:55.522 --> 16:57.707
She just sucks them in.

16:58.050 --> 17:01.407
If I tell the fire, “Now come along you have been ignited."

17:01.527 --> 17:06.499
I don’t even tell, I don’t even tell, they immediately suck in.

17:06.620 --> 17:09.472
Their Kundalini rises you can say.

17:09.612 --> 17:15.323
You put a fire in front of My photograph it’s vibrated,

17:17.682 --> 17:22.604
you put a light it’s vibrated, it has no alternatives.

17:22.839 --> 17:25.331
It doesn’t think it has no alternatives,

17:25.452 --> 17:30.266
it’s just enlightened, it has its own quality
of enlightenment in the purest sense,

17:30.386 --> 17:33.523
because thinking makes it impure.

17:33.643 --> 17:37.244
Your enlightenment becomes impure by your thinking,

17:37.365 --> 17:44.056
by giving explanations, by giving all these nonsensical alternatives.

17:44.776 --> 17:49.867
In reality whatever you are, you are the highest.

17:50.043 --> 17:54.359
You are the highest epitome of all the creatures.

17:54.541 --> 17:58.109
Even the thing that comes out of the Mother Earth

17:58.230 --> 18:03.175
cannot do the work that you can. It cannot raise the Kundalini,

18:03.296 --> 18:06.890
it cannot, no maybe a little bit, effects might be,

18:07.011 --> 18:10.476
but it won’t work out with that force with that maneuvering I mean

18:10.597 --> 18:17.429
you are like a very advanced machinery of God’s work,

18:17.550 --> 18:22.800
very advanced, extremely sharp, and extremely effective.

18:22.921 --> 18:26.701
And the problem is this brain of yours, you see, when it comes in between,

18:26.822 --> 18:29.628
which is nothing compared to that big brain, you see.

18:29.749 --> 18:34.292
Your brain is nothing but like a little mosquito, it comes up, comes here

18:34.413 --> 18:36.803
and there, says, “Oh, this, this, this, this, this”

18:36.924 --> 18:38.662
and then the problem starts.

18:38.783 --> 18:43.460
But if you really start using this power within you,

18:43.581 --> 18:48.538
God has made you as the best instrument that you could think.

18:48.675 --> 18:52.640
And as you start using your instrument with that wisdom

18:52.761 --> 18:58.929
and surrender or humility, gradually it evolves more and more and more,

18:59.050 --> 19:05.960
and you start developing more sensitive sides, or we can say

19:06.081 --> 19:09.479
evolving a new method in this

19:09.600 --> 19:15.275
and getting a better and better understanding of the working of Sahaja Yoga.

19:15.531 --> 19:19.273
So it is important that first of all you must decide

19:19.394 --> 19:23.698
to stop the brain working too much and say that

19:23.819 --> 19:25.425
“Mother You be in our brain."

19:25.546 --> 19:28.739
Thank God I’m before you in person, it’s not difficult.

19:28.859 --> 19:32.281
Just say that “Mother, You have to be in our brain."

19:32.402 --> 19:37.480
Now this brain is as you know, is supported by the five elements,

19:37.600 --> 19:42.050
they all are in this brain and if you can somehow or other

19:42.171 --> 19:45.734
bring Me in that brain, somehow or other, by telling your brain,

19:45.855 --> 19:49.875
now, not to disturb you any more, you’ll be amazed that

19:49.996 --> 19:56.163
immediately the whole system will start working like a dynamo.

19:56.284 --> 19:59.544
It will be such a sensitive thing, you don’t have worry about anything,

19:59.664 --> 20:01.316
don’t have to think about anything.

20:01.437 --> 20:05.242
You touch anything it becomes gold sort of thing,
you see becomes Midas’ touch,

20:05.363 --> 20:06.795
becomes such a great thing.

20:06.916 --> 20:09.804
But that, to achieve, is difficult for human beings.

20:09.991 --> 20:15.444
They find it difficult to achieve that kind of a perfection

20:15.565 --> 20:21.981
where you lose completely your ego and you become egoless.

20:22.101 --> 20:27.221
Like the fire, the Mother Earth, like all other elements – they have no ego.

20:27.342 --> 20:29.514
It’s only human beings who have built the ego.

20:29.635 --> 20:33.678
And the ego is such a big myth. Of course when you don’t do anything,

20:33.799 --> 20:36.436
why should you think you are doing something,

20:36.557 --> 20:39.686
and why should you be responsible for doing anything?

20:39.815 --> 20:42.359
But the thing is, we think that,

20:42.480 --> 20:47.272
“No it’s not God, we have to do this thing,” and “I have to decide."

20:47.393 --> 20:50.857
You see it’s just we play tricks with ourselves morning till evening

20:50.978 --> 20:54.709
spoiling our brain, absolutely becoming mad.

20:54.830 --> 20:56.967
Best thing is to surrender

20:57.088 --> 21:00.082
and see the things will come before you, you’ll be amazed,

21:00.203 --> 21:03.678
oh, how it has happened, how it has worked out.

21:03.799 --> 21:07.060
The other day I told just Kerry, “You better go and register yourself."

21:07.181 --> 21:11.707
She said, “Mother the university has closed down these days,

21:11.828 --> 21:14.075
I can’t get into it, it’s very difficult."

21:14.272 --> 21:16.449
I said, “All right I’ve said it, you go."

21:16.570 --> 21:19.738
Then she telephoned, they said, “It’s impossible, you just can’t do it

21:19.859 --> 21:21.569
but if you want you can come and see."

21:21.694 --> 21:24.132
And as she walked into the university in the office

21:24.253 --> 21:26.930
they said, “All right, come along you are registered."

21:31.939 --> 21:34.889
It is, so many times it will happen to you people.

21:35.010 --> 21:42.006
But it took about ten minutes for Me to convince her that you just try it.

21:42.127 --> 21:46.211
But I must say still she was not so adamant she was thinking,

21:46.332 --> 21:50.193
” If Mother is saying, I may get it this thing, it will work out."

21:50.314 --> 21:52.750
But if you suppose, “It’s all right, Mother

21:52.871 --> 21:55.443
You are saying, I’m just going to register, finished."

21:55.564 --> 22:00.271
Then what happens even if you do not get registered doesn’t matter.

22:00.399 --> 22:04.544
That’s not important. Your brain improves.

22:04.665 --> 22:08.435
That’s important, that your brain improves, it becomes more sensitive.

22:08.556 --> 22:12.427
It’s not important that the work should be done, that’s not important.

22:12.548 --> 22:15.432
What is important that in you brain you must get this idea that

22:15.552 --> 22:21.114
“Let me be enlightened, truly." All right? This is what one has to understand,

22:21.235 --> 22:26.641
in a very subtle way that we all are very sensitive instruments

22:26.762 --> 22:30.369
made by God and all our energies are not yet working.

22:30.489 --> 22:32.797
So we have to supply energy to all our nerves

22:32.918 --> 22:36.884
and that’s only possible if we remove our blockages

22:37.004 --> 22:39.523
created by our ego and by our conditioning.

22:39.644 --> 22:43.473
If you can remove the blockages, all our nerves will become very sensitive.

22:43.606 --> 22:46.500
And that’s why, tell your mind that,

22:46.621 --> 22:50.064
“Now any further, you better put Mother down there."
