00:00:11.477 --> 00:00:16.295
So it’s very nice to arrive here among all of you and

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:21.532
I’m sorry for what has happened before My coming here.

00:00:22.085 --> 00:00:27.054
But, as I also told you that nature also

00:00:27.437 --> 00:00:32.464
can be awakened with the presence of a Divine personality,

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:36.646
and once it is awakened it starts behaving in a manner,

00:00:36.847 --> 00:00:39.123
as a realized soul would do.

00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:49.761
Like it gets angry with people who are not religious,

00:00:49.882 --> 00:00:53.019
people who don’t want to know about God,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.875
people who are doing wrong things on life,

00:00:55.996 --> 00:00:59.344
people who are not normal people,

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:04.242
in the sense they don’t want to be part and parcel of the whole,

00:01:04.363 --> 00:01:06.909
recluses, all sorts of people.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.430
And once it is brought to that level then it starts working on its own.

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:16.968
As you know that according to Sahaja Yoga

00:01:17.089 --> 00:01:21.379
all these elements have got a deity behind it.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.883
For example, agni has got a deity called Agni Devata.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:31.641
In pure form Agni Devata is the one, which really purifies us.

00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:35.406
It purifies everything, it purifies say a gold,

00:01:35.527 --> 00:01:38.523
if you put gold in the fire it doesn’t burn,

00:01:38.644 --> 00:01:41.610
it comes out more brilliant, better.

00:01:41.777 --> 00:01:47.179
But if it is something that is not of such a value it will burn off.

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:50.318
So all inflammable things are mostly

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.063
of a low-grade things, which are to be burned only.

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:58.947
But amazingly these lower things only

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:02.402
when they are enlightened or you can say,

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:08.084
when you put some wood, you take and you put fire to it,

00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:11.440
so when fire is added to that wood

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.833
the same fire which is coming, actually the base is that wood itself,

00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:22.944
it is inflammable, and the flames that are coming out of that fire,

00:02:23.065 --> 00:02:26.133
once they are enlightened

00:02:26.254 --> 00:02:31.610
they start knowing what is truth, what is untruth.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:36.660
Or reacting in such a manner as if they know it, what work has to be done.

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:41.054
Now the difference between a Sahaja Yogi and the fire,

00:02:41.175 --> 00:02:48.337
which is so initiated, is this, that it does not think about it.

00:02:49.156 --> 00:02:53.726
It just goes on completely finishing things, which it has to do.

00:02:53.998 --> 00:02:59.530
And by a method of frequencies it knows where to go and which one to burn off.

00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:04.640
And that’s how it goes on burning things, which it has to burn.

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:09.183
And some of the unfortunate things are

00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:14.179
that people feel that this fire has no compassion

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:19.507
and that the fire must have some compassion also to spare some people.

00:03:19.628 --> 00:03:25.174
But the trouble is we must understand that we have so many things within us.

00:03:25.315 --> 00:03:28.990
We’ve got fire, we’ve got water, we’ve got Mother Earth

00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:30.799
all elements are within us.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.160
But in the fire – it is only the fire element, nothing else.

00:03:35.281 --> 00:03:39.721
So it acts according to its own quality, that is fire.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.229
And whatever is the quality of the fire when enlightened,

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.880
separates truth from untruth

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.380
and starts behaving in that manner, but it remains fire.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.746
It cannot become compassion.

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:57.004
But in a way if you see, when you start choosing

00:03:57.125 --> 00:04:00.808
between the wrong type of a person and a right type of a person

00:04:00.929 --> 00:04:05.250
if you see in a subtle way it is compassion because it is truth,

00:04:05.371 --> 00:04:07.117
and truth is love.

00:04:07.238 --> 00:04:11.761
So whatever it is doing is to manifest the love of God,

00:04:11.882 --> 00:04:14.765
and when it is manifesting the love of God

00:04:14.886 --> 00:04:17.343
you should know, that though it is fire

00:04:17.464 --> 00:04:20.867
it gets the performance of a personality,

00:04:20.988 --> 00:04:24.664
which is as if, is a human being.

00:04:24.785 --> 00:04:27.406
Because it is discreet.

00:04:27.527 --> 00:04:32.343
It knows what to burn and what not to burn.

00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:39.472
One day I must tell you, we were doing some sort of a cleaning of the doors

00:04:39.593 --> 00:04:44.875
with those lamps you get and Linda one day you see by mistake,

00:04:44.996 --> 00:04:48.574
brought that lamp very close to My body

00:04:48.695 --> 00:04:51.918
and the lamp, the flame was very strong,

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.570
but it just went round Me, didn’t touch Me.

00:04:56.691 --> 00:04:59.265
She was surprised, she said, ” Mother You’re burning."

00:04:59.386 --> 00:05:02.328
I said, “Don’t worry,” it just went round and came out.

00:05:03.339 --> 00:05:09.218
So the fire doesn’t burn a person who is pure, doesn’t burn.

00:05:09.339 --> 00:05:12.885
The example is Sitaji.

00:05:13.212 --> 00:05:19.225
Sitaji when She was brought by Shri Rama from Ravana’s place,

00:05:19.346 --> 00:05:22.283
you see, everybody said that She has lived with a Rakasha

00:05:22.404 --> 00:05:28.307
and She must be found out whether She is guilty or not.

00:05:28.726 --> 00:05:33.467
So Rama first of all He said, “All right,” He put the fire.

00:05:33.588 --> 00:05:37.897
She Herself said that, “You put a fire, a big pyre of fire,”

00:05:38.018 --> 00:05:39.687
and She sat on that.

00:05:39.972 --> 00:05:44.612
And when the fire started burning it could not burn Her,

00:05:44.733 --> 00:05:48.929
She could not be burnt, you see, and the whole fire subsided.

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.038
So that time the Agni Devata knows what is right, what is wrong.

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:58.528
Who is holy, who is unholy.

00:05:59.033 --> 00:06:02.768
But human beings take lot of time to recognize that

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:05.003
and to understand, even in Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:05.124 --> 00:06:09.071
because the sensitivity has to be grown much more.

00:06:09.192 --> 00:06:12.802
Now why is it, that anything that like water,

00:06:12.923 --> 00:06:16.268
or Agni or any one of these elements become

00:06:16.388 --> 00:06:19.135
so sensitive than human beings are.

00:06:19.256 --> 00:06:22.655
How they just obediently do the thing,

00:06:22.776 --> 00:06:26.581
as if they know the job and they’re so quick at it, so efficient.

00:06:26.702 --> 00:06:31.448
The reason is they are completely under the control of the Divine.

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:38.633
They are under the control of the powers of God, absolutely, hundred percent.

00:06:38.754 --> 00:06:43.404
Whatever God wants, they do it, once they are enlightened.

00:06:43.525 --> 00:06:46.324
But human beings are still, you see,

00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:51.486
dwindling between his own human awareness and the Divine awareness

00:06:51.606 --> 00:06:53.418
and the oneness with God.

00:06:53.538 --> 00:06:58.048
So it is the sensitivity in a person grows very, very, slowly

00:06:58.169 --> 00:07:00.552
– doesn’t matter makes no difference –

00:07:00.673 --> 00:07:04.199
and when it grows, it comes you see it moves sometimes,

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.852
two steps forwards and five steps backwards, you see again like that.

00:07:07.973 --> 00:07:11.379
When the time is about two years, you’ll find a gentleman at the same spot

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.301
where he started.

00:07:13.422 --> 00:07:17.375
You get quite upset at how it has happened, despite Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:17.496 --> 00:07:20.652
But this is the thing is, that human beings can think,

00:07:20.773 --> 00:07:24.219
and they can decide, and they have ultimate freedom

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:28.484
to give up this sensitivity at any time.

00:07:29.018 --> 00:07:35.312
So you have to be under complete obedience of the Divine,

00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:37.969
which is, one cannot understand sometimes

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.939
how to be like that because we have not been brought up that way.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:44.634
We don’t know how to do it and it’s very difficult.

00:07:44.755 --> 00:07:47.631
So many people say, “Mother it’s very difficult to surrender."

00:07:47.752 --> 00:07:50.265
It’s not that they don’t want to surrender, but they think

00:07:50.386 --> 00:07:53.361
that, “We are still you see, there is still ego popping up somewhere,

00:07:53.482 --> 00:07:55.870
Mother says something but we start questioning her.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.247
Mother says this, then we think that we should,

00:07:59.368 --> 00:08:04.252
we can suggest to Mother there’s another alternative and this and that."

00:08:04.373 --> 00:08:08.005
But there’s no alternative, there’s no alternative

00:08:08.126 --> 00:08:10.774
for a person who’s a sensible person.

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:14.289
If he knows that Divine is only thinking of your hitha,

00:08:14.425 --> 00:08:19.225
of your well-being, and whatever it sees and does, you see,

00:08:19.346 --> 00:08:23.588
knows much more than you, much much more.

00:08:23.709 --> 00:08:27.127
And in so many dimensions that, if

00:08:27.248 --> 00:08:31.311
somebody says so that, “Do like this,” best is to do that.

00:08:31.432 --> 00:08:33.733
Sometimes it shocks people.

00:08:33.918 --> 00:08:36.599
People have ideas about sympathies,

00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.513
ideas about being, you see, kind to others,

00:08:40.634 --> 00:08:43.229
and compassionate to others.

00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:46.966
But what is a human compassion, it doesn’t do anything it just talks.

00:08:47.087 --> 00:08:50.480
While the God’s compassion works, it works.

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.367
It works on people, it doesn’t talk that, “Oh, I’m very compassionate,

00:08:55.488 --> 00:08:59.973
I’m full of compassion,” nothing, it just works, it manifests itself.

00:09:00.094 --> 00:09:05.351
So one should understand to be a complete ego-less personality,

00:09:05.472 --> 00:09:12.336
one should try to obey the Self within yourself.

00:09:12.457 --> 00:09:15.654
Now how do you obey yourself within yourself?

00:09:15.775 --> 00:09:18.384
It is through vibratory awareness.

00:09:19.001 --> 00:09:22.556
Try to obey through your vibratory awareness.

00:09:22.677 --> 00:09:25.822
Any question you want to ask, anything you want to do,

00:09:25.943 --> 00:09:30.596
you must obey it through your vibratory awareness.

00:09:30.717 --> 00:09:34.255
Now some people are not so sensitive, that’s true.

00:09:34.376 --> 00:09:38.331
The reason why they are not sensitive is because they think about it.

00:09:38.451 --> 00:09:41.783
Now you think with your brain, all right?

00:09:41.904 --> 00:09:44.638
If your brain can be enlightened,

00:09:44.759 --> 00:09:49.466
then you will think as the Divine thinks and your sensitivity will improve,

00:09:49.587 --> 00:09:53.108
because sensitivity comes from the central nervous system.

00:09:53.228 --> 00:09:55.978
Now in the central nervous system if there is any blockage

00:09:56.099 --> 00:09:58.029
it is actually in the brain

00:09:58.150 --> 00:10:02.033
because all the centers are represented in the brain.

00:10:02.154 --> 00:10:04.529
So the best thing is to say that,

00:10:04.650 --> 00:10:09.666
“Mother come in my brain. Please reside in my brain.

00:10:09.787 --> 00:10:13.186
Please make Your room in this brain.

00:10:13.306 --> 00:10:16.106
You be the controller of this brain.

00:10:16.227 --> 00:10:19.963
Let this brain be guided by Your divine wisdom."

00:10:20.084 --> 00:10:22.162
And you don’t think for yourself,

00:10:22.283 --> 00:10:25.970
and this word ‘I think’ should be dropped completely from Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:29.169
‘I think’ means, goes on you see, in funny ways;

00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:31.395
it can be anything, you see.

00:10:31.516 --> 00:10:34.292
Like once we went out and we had

00:10:34.413 --> 00:10:39.941
one of my very stupid relations staying with us, a girl.

00:10:40.062 --> 00:10:43.572
And as I was going out – we had no servants that day,

00:10:43.694 --> 00:10:47.147
so I was cooking – but that day when we were going out I said to her,

00:10:47.268 --> 00:10:50.936
“I’m going in the morning, so can you make a little bit of khichdi  for us

00:10:51.057 --> 00:10:53.568
and when we come back we’ll have it."

00:10:53.689 --> 00:10:57.643
That’s the only cooking she did in her lifetime, maybe she did not do also.

00:10:57.764 --> 00:11:03.054
So when we came back she told Me that she has not cooked.

00:11:03.174 --> 00:11:04.943
So I said, “Why? Why didn’t you cook,

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:07.509
because we were supposed to take our food here."

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.799
She said, “I thought that maybe you may not come.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.670
Maybe you’re not hungry, maybe you may not like to eat.

00:11:15.791 --> 00:11:17.571
Maybe I may not cook well,”

00:11:17.692 --> 00:11:20.766
you see, all these four alternatives not to do the cooking.

00:11:20.887 --> 00:11:25.807
But I said, “Why didn’t you think that we may be hungry, that we will eat.

00:11:25.928 --> 00:11:27.729
Why didn’t you think this way?”

00:11:27.853 --> 00:11:30.869
“But I thought,” you see this is an explanation

00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:35.797
for not having one in the brain I should say,

00:11:35.918 --> 00:11:40.848
that there is no Divine guidance in the brain.

00:11:40.969 --> 00:11:44.576
Then the guidance comes from your ego

00:11:44.697 --> 00:11:49.377
or from your superego, which says, “I thought that this might happen."

00:11:49.497 --> 00:11:52.194
But how, why, why did you think like that?

00:11:52.315 --> 00:11:54.236
Why not the other way round?

00:11:54.357 --> 00:11:56.354
Why didn’t you think the other way round?

00:11:56.475 --> 00:11:58.502
But that is how it is,

00:11:58.623 --> 00:12:02.557
and when these things happen we really are so much used to this

00:12:02.677 --> 00:12:07.381
kind of justification and alternatives to be offered,

00:12:07.501 --> 00:12:10.278
that this becomes again the habit

00:12:10.398 --> 00:12:14.991
of the brain and the brain gets separated from the Divine.

00:12:15.112 --> 00:12:18.487
So you tell your brain, “But why, why did you think like that?

00:12:18.607 --> 00:12:22.491
Now will you stop thinking about these things on these lines?

00:12:22.612 --> 00:12:25.046
Let us think of the positive thinking."

00:12:25.167 --> 00:12:27.788
Now positive thinking is nothing but is a thinking

00:12:27.909 --> 00:12:30.701
– as according to Sahaja Yoga, is not aggressive thinking,

00:12:30.822 --> 00:12:39.859
but it means that a thinking which helps to manifest the Divine.

00:12:40.268 --> 00:12:42.346
That is what is positive thinking.

00:12:45.525 --> 00:12:50.462
And the result of that is that

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:56.490
your nerves start opening out, and you start feeling

00:13:00.843 --> 00:13:07.437
the  manifestations of divine power in your fingers in your being.

00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:12.199
And this is the basic thing that doesn’t happen in the West

00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:14.783
or in the Western culture because

00:13:14.904 --> 00:13:20.038
we have a very big idea of always giving an explanation for anything.

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:22.831
Now you can see that, supposing

00:13:22.952 --> 00:13:27.917
you go to a person who is possessed and you get possessed,

00:13:28.038 --> 00:13:31.733
then you’ll give an explanation you see, I went to that person

00:13:31.854 --> 00:13:36.164
thinking, I thought, that I would cure that person.

00:13:36.285 --> 00:13:39.976
But the result is that you are mad now.

00:13:40.097 --> 00:13:43.500
Instead of that person getting cured, you get posessed.

00:13:43.621 --> 00:13:47.790
So what is the reason? The reason is that you thought in a very negative way,

00:13:47.911 --> 00:13:52.110
that, “I thought that this would help me

00:13:52.231 --> 00:13:57.486
or I was helping that person”. On the contrary you got into trouble.

00:13:57.606 --> 00:14:02.080
Now the trouble did not think,

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.893
no, it just entered into you without thinking.

00:14:06.014 --> 00:14:09.627
It is there, it never thought “whether I enter this person or not,”

00:14:09.748 --> 00:14:13.559
it just came in, walked straight forward. 
While you were busy thinking, you see,

00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:17.739
it entered into your being and settled down there.

00:14:17.860 --> 00:14:23.426
So it’s like a thief

00:14:23.559 --> 00:14:27.871
walking into your house nicely when you are busy,

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:32.496
absentmindedly doing something, you see, it’s exactly like this.

00:14:32.617 --> 00:14:34.770
You see the thief walking in suddenly you find

00:14:34.891 --> 00:14:37.199
Oh, the thief is standing behind you

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:40.166
– now you said, “I was thinking."

00:14:45.104 --> 00:14:48.342
Is exactly the same way it happens to us

00:14:48.463 --> 00:14:53.108
and when we know, our mind knows, that “I can give an explanation about it."

00:14:53.229 --> 00:14:58.897
Every time it is ready to give explanation then the mind, you see,

00:14:59.018 --> 00:15:02.702
is used to that kind of a phenomenon,

00:15:02.823 --> 00:15:06.706
that it will always give an excuse, always it will say something.

00:15:06.827 --> 00:15:09.647
So it is never on the alert, because you see,

00:15:09.768 --> 00:15:13.170
even if the trouble walks into you, you’ll always say

00:15:13.291 --> 00:15:14.643
“this is the explanation."

00:15:14.764 --> 00:15:19.620
But explanation doesn’t cure, doesn’t help you.

00:15:19.741 --> 00:15:22.713
Because by mental explanation...

00:15:23.091 --> 00:15:28.130
She’s not well, give her some soothing things.

00:15:35.298 --> 00:15:42.005
So one should not be extremely on the thought waves

00:15:42.173 --> 00:15:44.630
and on depending on their thinking

00:15:44.751 --> 00:15:47.583
because, you see, thinking has an alternative.

00:15:47.704 --> 00:15:50.653
Thinking always has an alternative.

00:15:50.774 --> 00:15:54.743
You can say, ” I was thinking this, or I was thinking that."

00:15:54.891 --> 00:15:56.281
But whom are you blaming?

00:15:56.402 --> 00:15:59.549
It was you who were thinking so you are responsible for that.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:03.469
So if you take the responsibility for your thinking,

00:16:03.610 --> 00:16:06.227
then you may not do such a thing as to say that,

00:16:06.348 --> 00:16:10.837
“I thought, if I had done this thing it would have been better,”

00:16:11.021 --> 00:16:14.568
because you are responsible for your thinking.

00:16:14.688 --> 00:16:17.121
Supposing an engine driver decides that

00:16:17.242 --> 00:16:21.288
“I thought I better go by the other route,” and has a big accident.

00:16:21.408 --> 00:16:24.469
People will ask him, “Why did you think like that?

00:16:24.593 --> 00:16:27.367
What was the thing that made you think like that?”

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:31.570
But in everyday to day life I find human beings are always saying,

00:16:31.691 --> 00:16:37.320
“I think, I think, I think,” all the time giving alternatives

00:16:37.441 --> 00:16:42.183
and that’s why they go up and down, up and down, up and down like that.

00:16:42.304 --> 00:16:48.226
But for fire, or for water, or for Mother Earth

00:16:48.347 --> 00:16:51.733
there is no alternative, no more alternative.

00:16:51.854 --> 00:16:55.401
If I just touch the Mother Earth and I say, “Suck in their problems please,”

00:16:55.522 --> 00:16:57.707
She just sucks them in.

00:16:58.050 --> 00:17:01.407
If I tell the fire, “Now come along you have been ignited."

00:17:01.527 --> 00:17:06.499
I don’t even tell, I don’t even tell, they immediately suck in.

00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:09.472
Their Kundalini rises you can say.

00:17:09.612 --> 00:17:15.323
You put a fire in front of My photograph it’s vibrated,

00:17:17.682 --> 00:17:22.604
you put a light it’s vibrated, it has no alternatives.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:25.331
It doesn’t think it has no alternatives,

00:17:25.452 --> 00:17:30.266
it’s just enlightened, it has its own quality 
of enlightenment in the purest sense,

00:17:30.386 --> 00:17:33.523
because thinking makes it impure.

00:17:33.643 --> 00:17:37.244
Your enlightenment becomes impure by your thinking,

00:17:37.365 --> 00:17:44.056
by giving explanations, by giving all these nonsensical alternatives.

00:17:44.776 --> 00:17:49.867
In reality whatever you are, you are the highest.

00:17:50.043 --> 00:17:54.359
You are the highest epitome of all the creatures.

00:17:54.541 --> 00:17:58.109
Even the thing that comes out of the Mother Earth

00:17:58.230 --> 00:18:03.175
cannot do the work that you can. It cannot raise the Kundalini,

00:18:03.296 --> 00:18:06.890
it cannot, no maybe a little bit, effects might be,

00:18:07.011 --> 00:18:10.476
but it won’t work out with that force with that maneuvering I mean

00:18:10.597 --> 00:18:17.429
you are like a very advanced machinery of God’s work,

00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:22.800
very advanced, extremely sharp, and extremely effective.

00:18:22.921 --> 00:18:26.701
And the problem is this brain of yours, you see, when it comes in between,

00:18:26.822 --> 00:18:29.628
which is nothing compared to that big brain, you see.

00:18:29.749 --> 00:18:34.292
Your brain is nothing but like a little mosquito, it comes up, comes here

00:18:34.413 --> 00:18:36.803
and there, says, “Oh, this, this, this, this, this”

00:18:36.924 --> 00:18:38.662
and then the problem starts.

00:18:38.783 --> 00:18:43.460
But if you really start using this power within you,

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:48.538
God has made you as the best instrument that you could think.

00:18:48.675 --> 00:18:52.640
And as you start using your instrument with that wisdom

00:18:52.761 --> 00:18:58.929
and surrender or humility, gradually it evolves more and more and more,

00:18:59.050 --> 00:19:05.960
and you start developing more sensitive sides, or we can say

00:19:06.081 --> 00:19:09.479
evolving a new method in this

00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:15.275
and getting a better and better understanding of the working of Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:15.531 --> 00:19:19.273
So it is important that first of all you must decide

00:19:19.394 --> 00:19:23.698
to stop the brain working too much and say that

00:19:23.819 --> 00:19:25.425
“Mother You be in our brain."

00:19:25.546 --> 00:19:28.739
Thank God I’m before you in person, it’s not difficult.

00:19:28.859 --> 00:19:32.281
Just say that “Mother, You have to be in our brain."

00:19:32.402 --> 00:19:37.480
Now this brain is as you know, is supported by the five elements,

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.050
they all are in this brain and if you can somehow or other

00:19:42.171 --> 00:19:45.734
bring Me in that brain, somehow or other, by telling your brain,

00:19:45.855 --> 00:19:49.875
now, not to disturb you any more, you’ll be amazed that

00:19:49.996 --> 00:19:56.163
immediately the whole system will start working like a dynamo.

00:19:56.284 --> 00:19:59.544
It will be such a sensitive thing, you don’t have worry about anything,

00:19:59.664 --> 00:20:01.316
don’t have to think about anything.

00:20:01.437 --> 00:20:05.242
You touch anything it becomes gold sort of thing, 
you see becomes Midas’ touch,

00:20:05.363 --> 00:20:06.795
becomes such a great thing.

00:20:06.916 --> 00:20:09.804
But that, to achieve, is difficult for human beings.

00:20:09.991 --> 00:20:15.444
They find it difficult to achieve that kind of a perfection

00:20:15.565 --> 00:20:21.981
where you lose completely your ego and you become egoless.

00:20:22.101 --> 00:20:27.221
Like the fire, the Mother Earth, like all other elements – they have no ego.

00:20:27.342 --> 00:20:29.514
It’s only human beings who have built the ego.

00:20:29.635 --> 00:20:33.678
And the ego is such a big myth. Of course when you don’t do anything,

00:20:33.799 --> 00:20:36.436
why should you think you are doing something,

00:20:36.557 --> 00:20:39.686
and why should you be responsible for doing anything?

00:20:39.815 --> 00:20:42.359
But the thing is, we think that,

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:47.272
“No it’s not God, we have to do this thing,” and “I have to decide."

00:20:47.393 --> 00:20:50.857
You see it’s just we play tricks with ourselves morning till evening

00:20:50.978 --> 00:20:54.709
spoiling our brain, absolutely becoming mad.

00:20:54.830 --> 00:20:56.967
Best thing is to surrender

00:20:57.088 --> 00:21:00.082
and see the things will come before you, you’ll be amazed,

00:21:00.203 --> 00:21:03.678
oh, how it has happened, how it has worked out.

00:21:03.799 --> 00:21:07.060
The other day I told just Kerry, “You better go and register yourself."

00:21:07.181 --> 00:21:11.707
She said, “Mother the university has closed down these days,

00:21:11.828 --> 00:21:14.075
I can’t get into it, it’s very difficult."

00:21:14.272 --> 00:21:16.449
I said, “All right I’ve said it, you go."

00:21:16.570 --> 00:21:19.738
Then she telephoned, they said, “It’s impossible, you just can’t do it

00:21:19.859 --> 00:21:21.569
but if you want you can come and see."

00:21:21.694 --> 00:21:24.132
And as she walked into the university in the office

00:21:24.253 --> 00:21:26.930
they said, “All right, come along you are registered."

00:21:31.939 --> 00:21:34.889
It is, so many times it will happen to you people.

00:21:35.010 --> 00:21:42.006
But it took about ten minutes for Me to convince her that you just try it.

00:21:42.127 --> 00:21:46.211
But I must say still she was not so adamant she was thinking,

00:21:46.332 --> 00:21:50.193
” If Mother is saying, I may get it this thing, it will work out."

00:21:50.314 --> 00:21:52.750
But if you suppose, “It’s all right, Mother

00:21:52.871 --> 00:21:55.443
You are saying, I’m just going to register, finished."

00:21:55.564 --> 00:22:00.271
Then what happens even if you do not get registered doesn’t matter.

00:22:00.399 --> 00:22:04.544
That’s not important. Your brain improves.

00:22:04.665 --> 00:22:08.435
That’s important, that your brain improves, it becomes more sensitive.

00:22:08.556 --> 00:22:12.427
It’s not important that the work should be done, that’s not important.

00:22:12.548 --> 00:22:15.432
What is important that in you brain you must get this idea that

00:22:15.552 --> 00:22:21.114
“Let me be enlightened, truly." All right? This is what one has to understand,

00:22:21.235 --> 00:22:26.641
in a very subtle way that we all are very sensitive instruments

00:22:26.762 --> 00:22:30.369
made by God and all our energies are not yet working.

00:22:30.489 --> 00:22:32.797
So we have to supply energy to all our nerves

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:36.884
and that’s only possible if we remove our blockages

00:22:37.004 --> 00:22:39.523
created by our ego and by our conditioning.

00:22:39.644 --> 00:22:43.473
If you can remove the blockages, all our nerves will become very sensitive.

00:22:43.606 --> 00:22:46.500
And that’s why, tell your mind that,

00:22:46.621 --> 00:22:50.064
“Now any further, you better put Mother down there."
