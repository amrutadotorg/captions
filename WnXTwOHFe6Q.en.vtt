Shri Fatima Puja, St Georges, Switzerland,
14 August 1988.

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:06.561
Today we are going to have a  puja of Fatimabi,

00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:11.086
who was the symbol of Gruhalakshmi,

00:00:12.138 --> 00:00:14.828
and so we are going to have the puja

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:18.459
of the Gruhalakshmi principle within us.

00:00:21.474 --> 00:00:24.798
As the housewife has to finish every work,

00:00:25.463 --> 00:00:28.803
everything in the household, and then she goes for a bath,

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.403
in the same way this morning, I had to do lots of things

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.701
and then I could come for your puja,

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.848
because today the house wife’s jobs were many.

00:00:40.303 --> 00:00:43.747
So I had to finish them like a good house wife.

00:00:47.262 --> 00:00:52.042
Now, the principle of Gruhalakshmi

00:00:53.554 --> 00:00:58.113
has been evolved and developed by the Divine,

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.830
it’s not a human being’s creation

00:01:04.987 --> 00:01:08.449
and as you know it resides in the Left Nabhi.

00:01:11.517 --> 00:01:17.687
The Gruhalakshmi is the one that is represented in the life of Fatima

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.288
who was the daughter of Mohammed Saheb.

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:29.150
Now She is always born in a relationship

00:01:30.895 --> 00:01:38.816
to a Guru, which is of virginity, of purity.

00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:42.786
So She comes as sister or

00:01:43.044 --> 00:01:46.202
She comes as a daughter.

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:52.311
Now the beauty of Fatima’s life is

00:01:53.904 --> 00:01:57.197
that after the death of Mohammed Saheb,

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:03.870
as usual, there were fanatic people who thought they can take

00:02:06.044 --> 00:02:08.210
the religion into their hands

00:02:08.488 --> 00:02:12.040
and can make it a very fanatic thing.

00:02:13.564 --> 00:02:16.251
The attention was not paid so much

00:02:16.831 --> 00:02:19.555
towards the ascent of the person.

00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:24.901
Even Mohammed Saheb has described his son in law in many ways.

00:02:25.607 --> 00:02:27.544
And He is the only one -

00:02:27.687 --> 00:02:31.830
or there’s another incarnation- of Brahmadeva,

00:02:33.543 --> 00:02:36.098
who came on this earth. Ali came on this earth,

00:02:36.162 --> 00:02:38.415
He was the incarnation of Brahmadeva

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:43.714
and his - another incarnation was Sopandeva
[brother of Jnaneshwara],

00:02:44.061 --> 00:02:47.206
which, you can go to Pune,

00:02:47.286 --> 00:02:49.269
you can see the temple of Sopandeva there.

00:03:23.348 --> 00:03:27.736
So we have Ali and his wife Fatima

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:33.767
who incarnated on the principle of the Left Nabhi.

00:03:37.323 --> 00:03:41.721
She stayed in her house, in her household

00:03:42.317 --> 00:03:46.282
and She observed what you call

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:50.665
a kind of a panda
[? Pata: veil]

00:03:50.792 --> 00:03:55.653
or niqab as they call it, to cover her face.

00:03:57.275 --> 00:03:59.657
It is a symbol that a woman

00:04:00.206 --> 00:04:05.518
who is a housewife has to

00:04:09.563 --> 00:04:16.418
save her chastity by covering her face because

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.103
She was a beautiful woman and

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:27.787
They were born in a country which was very, very violent

00:04:28.836 --> 00:04:31.729
and She would have been definitely attacked

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:36.264
in case She had not lived in that kind of fashion.

00:04:36.757 --> 00:04:39.380
As you know, in the time of Christ,

00:04:40.126 --> 00:04:43.978
though Mary was Mahalaxmi’s incarnation,

00:04:44.328 --> 00:04:47.570
had to be very, very potential personality

00:04:48.245 --> 00:04:52.122
and Christ did not want anybody to know what She was.

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.487
But though She was in the house, She was Shakti,

00:04:59.907 --> 00:05:05.303
so She allowed her sons

00:05:05.585 --> 00:05:08.442
or actually ordered them

00:05:09.572 --> 00:05:11.955
to fight those fanatics

00:05:12.628 --> 00:05:17.890
who were trying to deny the authority of her husband.

00:05:19.442 --> 00:05:22.966
And you know that  Hasan and Hussain, they were killed there.

00:05:23.754 --> 00:05:26.668
It’s a very beautiful thing how

00:05:27.635 --> 00:05:30.174
the Mahalaxmi Tatva of Sita

00:05:30.858 --> 00:05:34.288
took a form of Vishnumaya

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:43.700
just to establish the beautiful principle of

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:50.399
a housewife.

00:05:52.483 --> 00:05:55.379
Now, She was very powerful, no doubt,

00:05:56.234 --> 00:05:59.186
and She knew that her children will be killed.

00:06:01.684 --> 00:06:04.598
But these people are never killed,

00:06:04.956 --> 00:06:08.013
they never die nor do they suffer.

00:06:08.181 --> 00:06:11.675
It’s a drama they had to play to show people how stupid they are.

00:06:12.901 --> 00:06:15.797
As a result of that,

00:06:18.375 --> 00:06:23.289
another system started where they respected saints;

00:06:23.611 --> 00:06:29.470
like in India Shiya people respect Auliyas

00:06:29.982 --> 00:06:32.206
or we can call them the people

00:06:32.444 --> 00:06:35.351
who are Realized souls like Nizamuddin Saheb.

00:06:35.931 --> 00:06:39.775
Then we have got “Chisti”.

00:06:40.064 --> 00:06:46.029
We have got, in Ajmer, Hajrat Chisti.

00:06:46.452 --> 00:06:49.985
All these great Saints were respected by Shiyas.

00:06:50.576 --> 00:06:54.720
But still they could not transcend

00:06:55.143 --> 00:07:01.442
the limits of religiosity.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.209
So they also became extremely fanatic.

00:07:06.963 --> 00:07:12.031
Firstly they would not see to

00:07:12.695 --> 00:07:16.250
another religion where they had saints.

00:07:16.585 --> 00:07:20.661
They would not respect the saints who belonged to another religion

00:07:21.776 --> 00:07:27.611
and even when we had a great saint

00:07:28.275 --> 00:07:33.371
like Sai Nath of Shirdi, who was a Muslim to begin with,

00:07:35.153 --> 00:07:40.310
and it is said that Fatima herself brought him

00:07:40.533 --> 00:07:44.709
as a child in her lap and gave him to some lady.

00:07:46.142 --> 00:07:50.651
We did not deny,

00:07:50.946 --> 00:07:53.426
as far as Hindus were concerned,

00:07:54.127 --> 00:07:59.256
his saintliness, but the Muslims did not accept it.

00:08:00.181 --> 00:08:03.721
There's another one who is called Haji Malang, who is very near

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:06.914
Bombay, who was a realised soul.

00:08:07.634 --> 00:08:12.834
He, too, realised the fanaticism of the Shias.

00:08:13.209 --> 00:08:16.767
`Shia' word comes from Siya;

00:08:16.897 --> 00:08:19.452
in U.P. Sita is called as Siya.

00:08:20.974 --> 00:08:23.203
Sitaji is called as `Siya'.

00:08:24.127 --> 00:08:30.444
They also did not realise that there are saints who are not,

00:08:31.293 --> 00:08:35.461
so called, Muslims but they are saints.

00:08:35.949 --> 00:08:37.783
So they could not get out of it.

00:08:38.045 --> 00:08:41.223
So we have another one called Haji Malang

00:08:41.358 --> 00:08:44.971
who was worshipped by Hindus.

00:08:45.616 --> 00:08:48.610
Some Muslims also go there, no doubt.

00:08:51.407 --> 00:08:53.728
This Haji Malang

00:08:54.372 --> 00:08:58.992
was quite worried about the fanaticism of the Shias,

00:08:59.435 --> 00:09:03.410
so he appointed some Hindus to worship him,

00:09:03.959 --> 00:09:05.969
just to counter balance.

00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:08.225
They did all kinds of things.

00:09:08.777 --> 00:09:11.268
There are many saints like that.

00:09:12.549 --> 00:09:18.377
I went to Bhopal. There is another big saint who was buried [there].

00:09:18.989 --> 00:09:24.606
But his all disciples were just depending on the earnings

00:09:25.652 --> 00:09:28.217
of that place, which was very bad. Even

00:09:28.463 --> 00:09:32.370
Hazrat Nizamuddin's things are the same way as the Hindus do.

00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:35.024
They all make an earnings,

00:09:35.175 --> 00:09:38.621
I mean it's a kind of a commercial business.

00:09:40.151 --> 00:09:45.766
So this saint died and was buried there.

00:09:46.136 --> 00:09:48.421
There were many people who were depending on it.

00:09:48.569 --> 00:09:52.072
When I went there, I just, by the way, asked them,

00:09:53.032 --> 00:09:55.242
'What is your religion?'

00:09:56.001 --> 00:09:57.644
So they said 'We are Muslims'.

00:09:58.136 --> 00:10:01.249
I said what 'Was the religion of that saint who died?'

00:10:01.625 --> 00:10:04.133
He said 'Saints have no religions.'

00:10:05.693 --> 00:10:09.362
So I said 'Then why do you want to follow religion?
Why don't you follow his religion?'

00:10:09.553 --> 00:10:11.465
They have no religions.

00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:17.540
Even, it is said, in Sanskrit,  the Sanyasis have no religions.

00:10:17.997 --> 00:10:21.404
They are dharmatita, they go beyond the religion.

00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:24.934
But as it has happened with every incarnation,

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:28.722
it has happened even with the Shia people, with the Sunnis,

00:10:28.929 --> 00:10:31.441
with the Hindus, with the Muslims and everyone,

00:10:31.719 --> 00:10:34.206
that they made a fanatic group.

00:10:34.987 --> 00:10:39.391
Now fanaticism itself is absolutely against religion,

00:10:40.279 --> 00:10:43.637
against your innate religion within your-self

00:10:43.995 --> 00:10:46.494
because it creates poison.

00:10:48.222 --> 00:10:50.373
It's a venomous thing.

00:10:51.265 --> 00:10:53.796
It makes you hate others.

00:10:54.579 --> 00:10:56.865
When you start hating others,

00:10:57.360 --> 00:11:00.915
then it reacts in you as horrible poison

00:11:01.396 --> 00:11:05.651
which eats up all that is beautiful within you.

00:11:09.594 --> 00:11:11.707
Hating any one

00:11:12.297 --> 00:11:15.900
is the worst thing that human beings can do, but they can do it.

00:11:16.052 --> 00:11:19.402
They can do whatever they like.
Animals do not hate any one.

00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:22.225
Can you imagine? They don't know how to hate.

00:11:22.506 --> 00:11:24.886
They bite some one because that is their nature.

00:11:25.127 --> 00:11:27.660
They cut some one because that's their nature.

00:11:27.939 --> 00:11:29.884
They never hate someone.

00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.832
They may not like someone but this hatred, which is a poison,

00:11:34.002 --> 00:11:39.202
is a speciality of human conception

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.912
and human absorption. Only human beings can hate.

00:11:45.513 --> 00:11:48.261
And this horrible thing hatred

00:11:49.492 --> 00:11:53.438
was settled between even the Muslims which was not done.

00:11:53.991 --> 00:11:58.357
This Karbala was not created for hatred, but for love.

00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.680
Everything that was done for love was converted into hatred,

00:12:03.804 --> 00:12:06.151
in every religion.

00:12:07.585 --> 00:12:10.538
Now the worst part of the whole thing is,

00:12:10.714 --> 00:12:16.517
that one part which hates thinks the other part is the worst of all,

00:12:17.313 --> 00:12:22.600
and the another part thinks that the first part is the worst of all.

00:12:23.312 --> 00:12:28.440
Under what rule, law or logic they decide -

00:12:28.681 --> 00:12:33.119
that is their own lookout. So they club together like that.

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.502
While this principle of the Gruhalakshmi was specially created

00:12:41.661 --> 00:12:44.335
to overcome that hatred,

00:12:44.804 --> 00:12:49.753
to subdue that icy stuff called hatred,

00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:53.710
to remove, from the minds of the people, hatred -

00:12:53.928 --> 00:12:58.094
this Gruhalakshmi principle was created.

00:12:58.972 --> 00:13:04.323
How? In the family when you have a household,

00:13:07.856 --> 00:13:13.635
the Gruhalakshmi principle has to subdue the hatred

00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:20.587
between the children, between the husband and the children.

00:13:21.187 --> 00:13:25.831
But if she herself enjoys her hatred

00:13:26.517 --> 00:13:29.416
then how can she subdue it?

00:13:29.615 --> 00:13:34.634
She is the source of that peace which subdues hatred.

00:13:34.906 --> 00:13:37.836
Now in India we have joint family [system], you too have

00:13:38.013 --> 00:13:40.870
relations like uncles, aunties, this that.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.536
But the housewife's job is to smooth

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:54.918
smooth out all angularities of people which create friction.

00:13:58.601 --> 00:14:01.505
Now the man has to worship a housewife.

00:14:01.762 --> 00:14:05.396
It is said so, 'Yatra Narya Pujyante, Tatra Ramante Devata'-

00:14:05.686 --> 00:14:08.860
'wherever the housewife is respected,

00:14:09.682 --> 00:14:12.436
there only the Gods reside'.

00:14:15.297 --> 00:14:19.482
In our country, I, must say credit must go to the housewives

00:14:20.638 --> 00:14:22.908
because we are no good for economics,

00:14:22.933 --> 00:14:25.934
no good for politics, administration. Hopeless.

00:14:26.096 --> 00:14:27.739
Men folk are useless,

00:14:27.924 --> 00:14:30.685
they don't know any household work or anything,

00:14:30.813 --> 00:14:34.241
women have kept it to themselves, but our society is first class,

00:14:34.384 --> 00:14:36.914
is maintained by the women of the household.

00:14:39.291 --> 00:14:44.087
So the man has to respect the housewife, that's very important.

00:14:45.678 --> 00:14:49.626
If he does not respect his housewife, there's no possibility

00:14:49.793 --> 00:14:53.121
of any Gruhalakshmi tattva being maintained.

00:14:54.658 --> 00:14:59.042
It's like the preservation of that

00:15:02.046 --> 00:15:05.864
principle of a housewife.

00:15:08.055 --> 00:15:11.030
But some men, I mean many of them,

00:15:11.437 --> 00:15:15.701
think that it is their birth right to ill-treat their wives,

00:15:17.293 --> 00:15:20.102
to torture them, to say all kinds of things,

00:15:21.846 --> 00:15:24.710
to be angry,  if she is a good woman.

00:15:26.756 --> 00:15:28.971
But if she is a nagger, if she is a bhoot,

00:15:29.152 --> 00:15:30.910
then they are subdued, completely subdued.

00:15:31.013 --> 00:15:35.047
If the wife is a bhoot then husband always, sort of,

00:15:35.843 --> 00:15:40.148
tries to please her and be extremely kind to her.

00:15:40.427 --> 00:15:43.279
He knows she is a bhoot, after all, you know, be careful

00:15:45.346 --> 00:15:48.538
[you] don't know what time the bhoot will come like a snake on you!

00:15:49.136 --> 00:15:52.827
And if she knows how to nag or to argument,

00:15:53.074 --> 00:15:55.219
then also they are afraid. There's no love,

00:15:55.525 --> 00:15:57.644
they have no love or respect for each other

00:15:57.954 --> 00:16:00.718
but they have an awe or fear.

00:16:02.475 --> 00:16:04.572
And they are afraid of such a woman.

00:16:05.019 --> 00:16:09.725
Now some women think if they become flirtish then
the husbands are better controlled.

00:16:11.728 --> 00:16:15.145
But their basic principle they lose.

00:16:15.958 --> 00:16:18.632
The basic shakti that they have, they lose,

00:16:21.144 --> 00:16:23.527
and they land up in difficulties.

00:16:24.936 --> 00:16:28.398
So the basic principle of a Gruhalakshmi

00:16:28.525 --> 00:16:30.971
is to respect her chastity,

00:16:33.334 --> 00:16:37.375
to respect her chastity outside, inside.

00:16:39.491 --> 00:16:41.119
That is the steadiness of her.

00:16:41.299 --> 00:16:44.254
Of course most of the men take advantage of it.

00:16:45.051 --> 00:16:49.705
If the wife is docile or obedient,

00:16:49.913 --> 00:16:55.682
they make it a point that they just rule the wife, left and right.
Alright!

00:16:57.631 --> 00:17:01.631
But this woman, the housewife,

00:17:02.413 --> 00:17:06.430
has to know that she is not docile.

00:17:07.378 --> 00:17:12.039
She is obedient to her own righteousness,

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:18.070
to her own virtues, to her own qualities.

00:17:19.359 --> 00:17:22.385
If the husband is stupid, alright,

00:17:22.602 --> 00:17:25.046
he's stupid like a child, finished!

00:17:25.697 --> 00:17:28.709
But the husband has to know that he must

00:17:28.993 --> 00:17:31.965
respect, otherwise he is a lost case, he's finished,

00:17:33.042 --> 00:17:35.046
he's good for nothing.

00:17:37.357 --> 00:17:39.824
First thing is that he must see

00:17:40.055 --> 00:17:44.732
that the woman in the household is respected as a Gruhalakshmi.

00:17:45.642 --> 00:17:47.475
Then the blessings flow.

00:17:47.694 --> 00:17:53.273
But in no way he should insult her

00:17:53.729 --> 00:17:56.703
or be unkind to her

00:17:56.930 --> 00:18:00.181
and raise his voice or say things to her.

00:18:00.308 --> 00:18:05.771
But the wife has to be the one who is to be respected.

00:18:06.799 --> 00:18:09.283
I have so many times said, your wife is dominating,

00:18:09.406 --> 00:18:12.902
give her two slaps on the face, of course, no doubt.

00:18:13.519 --> 00:18:16.403
She has not to be dominating,

00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:20.667
she has to remove the dominating forces of others.

00:18:21.364 --> 00:18:23.792
She is the source of peace,

00:18:25.644 --> 00:18:28.091
she is the source of joy

00:18:28.481 --> 00:18:30.911
and she is the peacemaker.

00:18:31.486 --> 00:18:34.572
If she is the one who creates problems,

00:18:35.050 --> 00:18:38.917
then you can slap her nicely, bring her to her shape, is alright.

00:18:41.042 --> 00:18:44.552
So this Gruhalakshmi tattva is mutual.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:49.485
It doesn't depend only on the wife or husband but both of them.

00:18:49.607 --> 00:18:54.983
So once if you are making your wife suffer,

00:18:55.213 --> 00:18:59.089
your left Nabhi can never improve.

00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:06.788
Or if you are a bad wife your left Nabhi cannot improve.

00:19:07.706 --> 00:19:10.840
Now in the west the problem with women

00:19:10.956 --> 00:19:15.281
is this that they don't realise as to what is their power.

00:19:19.455 --> 00:19:23.672
An eighty year old woman also would like to look like a bride.

00:19:24.672 --> 00:19:29.272
They do not feel their dignity
and enjoy their dignity within themselves.

00:19:29.558 --> 00:19:32.150
They are the queen of the house

00:19:32.904 --> 00:19:36.058
but they want to behave like [a] cheapish, childish,

00:19:36.344 --> 00:19:38.344
young frivolous girl.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:43.136
They do not feel the dignity of their being,

00:19:43.605 --> 00:19:47.364
they talk too much, they behave in a manner

00:19:48.365 --> 00:19:52.338
that, does not behove a housewife.

00:19:52.513 --> 00:19:55.182
Like they'll take out their hands, talk like this,

00:19:55.682 --> 00:19:59.384
as the fisherwomen do, when they sell their fish to someone

00:19:59.552 --> 00:20:01.562
and when they have to fight.

00:20:02.882 --> 00:20:06.083
Or they shout sometimes, they shout also, I mean,

00:20:06.234 --> 00:20:10.316
I heard they shout and sometimes they beat their husbands,
that's the limit!

00:20:14.055 --> 00:20:17.618
They start always comparing themselves

00:20:18.158 --> 00:20:20.242
with the husband, to begin with.

00:20:20.663 --> 00:20:25.014
Like I am such a rich man's daughter,

00:20:25.166 --> 00:20:28.699
I am from such and such family, my husband is from such a

00:20:28.869 --> 00:20:31.244
low family he has no money,

00:20:31.427 --> 00:20:33.889
nothing, he's not educated, so ill-treat him.

00:20:34.374 --> 00:20:36.870
Treat him in a manner that so no respect.

00:20:37.577 --> 00:20:40.928
Such a woman will lose all her powers.

00:20:43.132 --> 00:20:48.023
Also in her own ways

00:20:48.555 --> 00:20:50.137
she will feel guilty,

00:20:50.765 --> 00:20:54.394
she'll feel guilty because, first of all, nobody has right

00:20:54.649 --> 00:20:58.540
to look down upon any one whatsoever in Sahaja Yoga specially.

00:20:59.944 --> 00:21:06.264
Then, to look down upon your husband, is something unbelievable.

00:21:07.835 --> 00:21:10.942
He may not be a Sahaja Yogi. Alright.

00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:15.268
He may not be up to the point, but by your behaviour,

00:21:15.411 --> 00:21:18.784
by your strength, by everything

00:21:21.154 --> 00:21:25.244
you can save him. But why are you losing yourself

00:21:26.948 --> 00:21:31.759
by dominating others, by strangling others,

00:21:32.386 --> 00:21:36.351
by making your husband a very, sort of a,

00:21:39.804 --> 00:21:42.216
frog in the well.

00:21:43.327 --> 00:21:47.199
Telling him, 'Oh, we both are after all we should enjoy.

00:21:47.263 --> 00:21:48.906
Lets have our house separately,

00:21:49.017 --> 00:21:52.099
nobody should come in the house'.
Even a rat won't enter that house.

00:21:54.232 --> 00:21:59.231
Even to say, 'Oh, these are my children, my husband, myself',

00:22:01.083 --> 00:22:04.937
is the negative of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:05.731 --> 00:22:08.497
is the negative form of understanding.

00:22:09.108 --> 00:22:12.858
These are absolutely absurd things,

00:22:12.970 --> 00:22:17.550
they do not look like, of any Sahaja Yogi or any sahaja yogini.

00:22:19.712 --> 00:22:22.015
All this kind of selfishness,

00:22:22.301 --> 00:22:27.073
all this kind of seclusion is against Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:29.657 --> 00:22:32.429
But a thing of a housewife is,

00:22:32.572 --> 00:22:36.058
'Oh, now how much should I prepare?'

00:22:36.530 --> 00:22:40.103
For example, 'There will be 50 persons coming.'

00:22:40.526 --> 00:22:42.724
So the husband says 'But only 10 are coming.

00:22:42.851 --> 00:22:45.184
Why do you want to have for 50 persons ?'

00:22:45.664 --> 00:22:48.184
'But may be they would like to eat more.'

00:22:48.772 --> 00:22:51.021
'But then why do you have 50 plates?'

00:22:51.624 --> 00:22:54.007
'Maybe they might bring there friends.'

00:22:54.563 --> 00:22:58.060
So she thinks of her generosity.

00:22:58.354 --> 00:23:00.038
She enjoys her generosity.

00:23:00.705 --> 00:23:02.189
I have known many like that.

00:23:02.324 --> 00:23:05.228
Though they are not even Sahaja Yoginis.

00:23:07.471 --> 00:23:09.772
They will say 'Will you come, sister in law,

00:23:09.852 --> 00:23:11.748
will you come for dinner?'  'Oh, I am not coming,

00:23:11.859 --> 00:23:14.026
you cook too many things.' 'Not coming?

00:23:14.256 --> 00:23:16.943
No, no, I'll cook very few things but please come.'

00:23:17.079 --> 00:23:19.122
Then she just start thinking immediately.

00:23:19.274 --> 00:23:22.181
'What vegetables are available in the market?

00:23:22.483 --> 00:23:24.588
What should I get? What is the best?'

00:23:24.747 --> 00:23:29.595
I mean, I am not their Guru, I am not their mother,

00:23:29.792 --> 00:23:32.016
I am just a relation,

00:23:32.859 --> 00:23:35.996
but they want to express their love through the food,

00:23:36.135 --> 00:23:41.048
they are the giver of food - Annadha . They are the Annapurnas

00:23:42.681 --> 00:23:44.966
and this is one of  the quality,

00:23:45.057 --> 00:23:47.466
the generosity for woman doesn't have

00:23:47.818 --> 00:23:51.066
she is not a sahaja yogini, by any chance. Take it from me.

00:23:52.839 --> 00:23:56.327
Husband may be little miserly, doesn't matter,

00:23:58.832 --> 00:24:01.175
but wife has to be very generous

00:24:01.318 --> 00:24:03.984
and sometimes, she secretly gives money,

00:24:05.188 --> 00:24:08.466
not to her own children but to others.

00:24:10.455 --> 00:24:14.791
Such beautiful women have to be there in Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:16.047 --> 00:24:18.780
But I feel so sorry, sometimes

00:24:19.962 --> 00:24:23.672
that the attack comes from the women of Sahaja Yogi,

00:24:26.138 --> 00:24:29.377
not from the men, on me. I'm a woman myself,

00:24:30.037 --> 00:24:34.724
and I feel shocked that women should attack me like this, for what?

00:24:38.073 --> 00:24:41.454
In Sahaja Yoga there is no domination of any kind

00:24:41.899 --> 00:24:46.196
but all these so called ideas of servility or domination comes

00:24:46.479 --> 00:24:51.711
from the false ideas you have, about your own dignity,

00:24:52.989 --> 00:24:55.232
about your own understanding.

00:24:55.431 --> 00:24:57.971
You are not aware of yourself.

00:24:59.334 --> 00:25:03.730
You do not know that you are the queen, nobody can dominate you.

00:25:04.235 --> 00:25:08.076
Who can dominate the lady, who rules the household?

00:25:11.298 --> 00:25:13.750
If supposing the husband says, 'I don't like this colour!'

00:25:13.893 --> 00:25:15.615
Alright, leave it for a while.

00:25:15.792 --> 00:25:17.979
Then somebody will come and say 'What a nice colour!'

00:25:18.067 --> 00:25:20.900
'Ah, such a nice colour, oh, don't change it.'

00:25:22.786 --> 00:25:25.669
The women must understand the men.

00:25:26.193 --> 00:25:29.734
They have big eyes. They are not microscopic.

00:25:31.065 --> 00:25:33.533
They see everything in a big way, you see.

00:25:34.117 --> 00:25:38.060
So today they will say something, tomorrow they will forget about it

00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:41.006
and they don't have microscopic eyes.

00:25:41.125 --> 00:25:42.966
They are too above these things.

00:25:43.336 --> 00:25:47.253
They are above these things. You must understand that!

00:25:48.854 --> 00:25:53.132
But if he sits on the horse, 'I must also sit on the horse
and fall down.

00:25:53.866 --> 00:25:56.715
If he goes for skiing - I'll also go for skiing.

00:25:57.279 --> 00:26:00.870
If he develops his muscles - I'll also develop my muscles.'

00:26:02.844 --> 00:26:04.923
It is coming to that point.

00:26:05.304 --> 00:26:08.078
I mean women start looking like nothing on earth.

00:26:08.213 --> 00:26:11.223
You don't know what sort of women these are with big, big muscles

00:26:11.327 --> 00:26:13.900
without any moustaches.

00:26:18.971 --> 00:26:21.726
So this kind of stupid ideas we have.

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.642
But there is no subordination of any kind.

00:26:24.730 --> 00:26:27.088
You are subordinated to your own dignity,

00:26:27.272 --> 00:26:30.527
to your own chastity, to your own sense of honour

00:26:30.919 --> 00:26:33.429
and, above all, to your righteousness

00:26:34.421 --> 00:26:37.877
because you are in charge of that. The man who is in charge,

00:26:39.732 --> 00:26:41.946
has to look after that side.

00:26:43.470 --> 00:26:45.172
How many quarrels you create?

00:26:45.324 --> 00:26:49.764
How can you be quarrelsome
when you are supposed to become the peacemaker?

00:26:49.978 --> 00:26:52.583
Supposing we send two peacemakers

00:26:52.909 --> 00:26:56.517
to some country to make peace and they cut each other's throat,

00:26:57.710 --> 00:26:59.972
what will you say to such a thing?

00:27:01.683 --> 00:27:04.962
You are the one who has to smooth down every thing,

00:27:06.169 --> 00:27:10.483
you have  the one who has to bring such

00:27:11.869 --> 00:27:15.823
expression of love, such sweet things

00:27:18.892 --> 00:27:24.840
that the family itself feels rested in you, secured

00:27:25.375 --> 00:27:27.358
because you are the mother.

00:27:27.790 --> 00:27:30.488
The family must feel secured within you

00:27:31.427 --> 00:27:34.731
and this love is your power.

00:27:37.183 --> 00:27:39.833
This is your power that you can give love

00:27:40.264 --> 00:27:44.711
and giving love you will find, you will always enrich yourself.

00:27:46.129 --> 00:27:49.621
I mean imagine what presents I give compared to what I get.

00:27:49.724 --> 00:27:52.121
I don't know I'll have to build another house!

00:27:52.322 --> 00:27:54.559
I am telling them "Don't give me individual present.

00:27:54.662 --> 00:27:56.448
I will not take any individual presents."

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.156
Now still despite that. I don't know,

00:27:59.363 --> 00:28:05.039
just with love if I get something with care, that love, you know,

00:28:06.258 --> 00:28:10.458
itself manifests and comes back to you like a poetry.

00:28:10.569 --> 00:28:12.682
You are some times surprised.

00:28:14.943 --> 00:28:18.665
I'll give you one simple example of my own life

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:22.375
which will tell you how love can work it out.

00:28:22.994 --> 00:28:26.315
I was a housewife to begin with and to end with, I think.

00:28:26.931 --> 00:28:29.272
And once I was in Delhi,

00:28:29.526 --> 00:28:34.411
my daughter was to be born, so I was knitting something for her,

00:28:34.526 --> 00:28:35.979
sitting outside in the lawn,

00:28:36.352 --> 00:28:40.086
when three persons walked into the house, one lady and two men

00:28:40.444 --> 00:28:42.756
and they came and said, "See now we are...

00:28:42.994 --> 00:28:46.377
housewife, I am a housewife and these two are,

00:28:46.496 --> 00:28:49.167
one is my husband and he is the friend of my husband

00:28:49.334 --> 00:28:50.566
and he is a Muslim,

00:28:50.741 --> 00:28:53.972
and we have come to you for shelter because we are refugees."

00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.773
I looked at them, they looked very good to Me,

00:28:56.869 --> 00:28:58.083
they were quite alright.

00:28:58.540 --> 00:29:01.678
I said, "Alright you please settle down in my house."

00:29:01.901 --> 00:29:04.119
So I gave them the outside room which had a kitchen

00:29:04.223 --> 00:29:06.304
and a bathroom and this thing,

00:29:06.471 --> 00:29:08.951
and for the gentleman, I said, "There is another spare room,

00:29:09.084 --> 00:29:11.340
you can stay there, and husband wife can stay here."

00:29:12.793 --> 00:29:14.718
In the evening my brother came in.

00:29:14.870 --> 00:29:16.718
He started shouting at the top of his voice,

00:29:16.854 --> 00:29:17.887
he said "What is this?

00:29:17.975 --> 00:29:20.173
You don't know these people, they may be thieves,

00:29:20.395 --> 00:29:24.415
they may be this, they might do this...[UNCLEAR]

00:29:24.653 --> 00:29:26.303
my husband came, he also joined him

00:29:26.407 --> 00:29:29.676
because, you see, they were friends!
He told you

00:29:30.578 --> 00:29:32.696
All men just the same, you see,

00:29:32.999 --> 00:29:34.930
so he said, "You see, she doesn't understand

00:29:35.017 --> 00:29:36.963
she has kept these three persons here.

00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.068
God knows, what they are, saying refugees, this thing.

00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.572
She doesn't know, he's a Muslim, he's a Hindu.

00:29:42.708 --> 00:29:45.900
God knows, she's two husbands, one husband" like that,

00:29:46.027 --> 00:29:47.529
all kind of things.

00:29:49.233 --> 00:29:51.113
Next morning they forgot about that.

00:29:51.876 --> 00:29:54.552
I said "Alright. Let them be there for one night. Is alright?

00:29:55.092 --> 00:29:57.039
I can't drag them out today, one night."

00:29:57.198 --> 00:29:59.638
Next morning they forgot that they where living there.

00:29:59.979 --> 00:30:01.060
That's like men!

00:30:01.156 --> 00:30:03.124
First day, such a blasting, such a blasting,

00:30:03.243 --> 00:30:06.620
I said "Alright, one night. Now don't shout. They will feel hurt.

00:30:06.946 --> 00:30:09.780
So let them stay one night, they'll be soothed down."

00:30:10.424 --> 00:30:12.809
Next morning they went away for their work.

00:30:12.912 --> 00:30:15.507
They had no time. It was, you see,

00:30:15.619 --> 00:30:19.136
only on a weekend they become active in the household,

00:30:19.351 --> 00:30:22.480
otherwise they are inactive. So they went away.

00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:27.031
It so happened that these people stayed with me for one month.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.577
Then this lady got a job

00:30:31.617 --> 00:30:37.115
and she went away with her husband and this Muslim.

00:30:37.401 --> 00:30:41.950
But in the meanwhile there was a big riot in Delhi, very big riot

00:30:42.379 --> 00:30:49.171
Because many Hindus and Sikh people were killed in Punjab.

00:30:49.632 --> 00:30:51.437
It had a reflection in Delhi

00:30:51.517 --> 00:30:53.850
and they started killing all the Muslims there.

00:30:54.283 --> 00:30:58.204
So, three, four Sikh people and one or two Hindus came to my house

00:30:58.339 --> 00:31:01.994
and they said "We are told that you have a Muslim staying with you."

00:31:02.322 --> 00:31:04.139
I said, "No. How can I have?"

00:31:04.616 --> 00:31:06.794
They said, "There is a Muslim. We have to kill him."

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:09.979
I said "See I am wearing such a big teeka (bindi),
can you believe it

00:31:10.281 --> 00:31:12.491
that I could have a Muslim in the house?"

00:31:13.547 --> 00:31:16.875
They thought I must be a real Hindu fanatic, you see!

00:31:20.620 --> 00:31:23.399
So they believed me. I said, "See now,

00:31:23.518 --> 00:31:25.955
if you have to go in my house, you'll go on my dead body

00:31:26.074 --> 00:31:27.621
because I will not allow you!"

00:31:27.756 --> 00:31:29.883
So they felt quite frightened. They went away.

00:31:30.089 --> 00:31:34.870
So this fellow heard My things and he came and he said,

00:31:35.008 --> 00:31:36.915
"I'm surprised. How did you risk your life?"

00:31:37.011 --> 00:31:39.582
I said, "There is nothing. Nothing."

00:31:40.034 --> 00:31:41.354
His life was saved.

00:31:41.859 --> 00:31:44.327
Now this gentleman, this Muslim gentleman,

00:31:44.469 --> 00:31:47.462
became a great poet called Sahir Ludhianvi,

00:31:49.321 --> 00:31:51.945
and this lady became a great actress,

00:31:52.716 --> 00:31:54.290
Kai nau ahe tenza?
(What is her name?)

00:31:54.457 --> 00:31:56.972
the one who used to act like a mother?

00:31:58.446 --> 00:32:01.623
Ha, Sachadev, Achala Sachadev.

00:32:02.949 --> 00:32:05.580
I knew it was, they had become one day and all that.

00:32:05.708 --> 00:32:07.548
But I didn't tell anybody about it.

00:32:07.755 --> 00:32:10.917
I said "Now supposing they come to know, I am in Bombay,

00:32:11.124 --> 00:32:12.889
they will just go mad about Me,"

00:32:12.968 --> 00:32:15.182
and I said "I have no time for all that."

00:32:15.524 --> 00:32:20.331
So, we started a film centre for the young people,

00:32:20.414 --> 00:32:21.636
to give them some good films.

00:32:21.723 --> 00:32:24.415
But it all made into a farce, later on.

00:32:24.644 --> 00:32:26.789
They never listened to Me, but whatever it is.

00:32:27.123 --> 00:32:31.561
So they said "We should get this Achala Sachadev to act as a mother"

00:32:31.879 --> 00:32:33.559
I said "Alright ,but don't tell her

00:32:33.639 --> 00:32:35.781
I have said, I have anything to do with it."

00:32:37.061 --> 00:32:42.160
So, years had passed, about I think about twelve  years or so.

00:32:44.221 --> 00:32:46.929
So they went and told her. So she was fussing like an actress.

00:32:47.017 --> 00:32:49.717
"No, no - how much are you going to pay me? I cannot act free.

00:32:49.845 --> 00:32:52.608
Everybody will ask for free. Then how can I give you free.

00:32:52.744 --> 00:32:54.102
You will have to give me Sari.

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:55.944
You'll have to give so much money. This thing."

00:32:56.021 --> 00:32:57.952
They said "Alright come to the muhurat at least.

00:32:58.071 --> 00:32:59.795
Come to the muhurat", to the beginning,

00:32:59.907 --> 00:33:02.692
big muhurat is the one where you start it.

00:33:03.365 --> 00:33:06.788
So she came and I was there. She looked at Me

00:33:06.966 --> 00:33:09.047
and just, you know, she couldn't believe

00:33:09.167 --> 00:33:10.835
that she has seen Me after twelve years.

00:33:10.947 --> 00:33:13.061
The tears starting swelling her eyes.

00:33:13.297 --> 00:33:16.196
Absolutely she couldn't say anything, just she came and

00:33:16.855 --> 00:33:18.802
fell into my arms

00:33:19.225 --> 00:33:22.767
and she said "Where were you last all these days?

00:33:22.918 --> 00:33:24.920
I have been trying to trace you out."

00:33:25.184 --> 00:33:28.377
Then she started describing Me and all.

00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:31.308
Then Sahir Ludhianvi was there and he said,

00:33:31.567 --> 00:33:34.564
"How this Lady is here?" They said, "This is Her work."

00:33:34.885 --> 00:33:37.855
"Oh God, why didn't you tell us? You see,

00:33:37.966 --> 00:33:39.656
we'll give our lives for Her!"

00:33:39.998 --> 00:33:42.280
And they were all amazed, how they were changed.

00:33:42.392 --> 00:33:45.021
"No money, nothing, I am going to give money for this project.

00:33:45.235 --> 00:33:46.302
Nothing doing. "

00:33:46.531 --> 00:33:47.531
See now,

00:33:47.939 --> 00:33:51.170
I was a housewife just an ordinary housewife.

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:55.126
I didn't have so many rights on

00:33:55.948 --> 00:33:58.910
my husband's property, or anything,

00:33:59.014 --> 00:34:01.174
and my brother another dominating fellow,

00:34:01.404 --> 00:34:04.033
both of them put together,

00:34:04.256 --> 00:34:06.670
just were about to kill me that night,

00:34:07.488 --> 00:34:10.524
with their temper and anger. I soothed them down

00:34:11.326 --> 00:34:13.616
and then you know when I told my husband

00:34:13.736 --> 00:34:15.855
and my brother, they were amazed.

00:34:16.014 --> 00:34:18.524
I said, "They are the ones who have become like this

00:34:18.962 --> 00:34:20.470
and see the change,

00:34:20.899 --> 00:34:23.236
how much they have...",

00:34:23.848 --> 00:34:26.518
and they said, "No more, we are going to say

00:34:26.606 --> 00:34:28.456
no to any charitable institution.

00:34:28.567 --> 00:34:30.489
This is the last mistake we have committed!"

00:34:30.656 --> 00:34:35.676
And the whole idea of a...

00:34:36.298 --> 00:34:40.776
earning and money just toppled down.

00:34:41.049 --> 00:34:44.294
And she has acted in many films for charity

00:34:45.009 --> 00:34:49.634
and this Ludhianvi also wrote many things for charity.

00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:57.189
So a woman can make a man a charitable personality -

00:34:58.290 --> 00:35:00.504
because she herself is charitable.

00:35:01.282 --> 00:35:03.919
She has so many beautiful..she's an artist!

00:35:05.202 --> 00:35:07.487
And she can create beauty around her,

00:35:07.808 --> 00:35:11.730
in her household, in her family, in her society.

00:35:11.889 --> 00:35:13.733
Everywhere. But no!

00:35:13.902 --> 00:35:17.354
Women want to fight like men. They will have associations.

00:35:17.833 --> 00:35:22.638
They would have called that [UNCLEAR]

00:35:24.939 --> 00:35:26.511
[UNCLEAR]

00:35:26.678 --> 00:35:30.662
unions, unions  they will like to have unions to fight for that.

00:35:34.051 --> 00:35:37.789
I agree that some of the men have been extremely cruel,

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:40.983
some of the laws have been extremely cruel, this thing, that thing,

00:35:41.238 --> 00:35:43.629
and that they have to be told.

00:35:44.323 --> 00:35:46.132
But this is not the way!

00:35:46.643 --> 00:35:52.150
There is another way of improving these men, who try to

00:35:53.715 --> 00:35:54.967
destroy the women,

00:35:55.237 --> 00:36:00.176
because women have one very great quality that Ganas are with them

00:36:02.675 --> 00:36:05.237
and Shri Ganapati is with them.

00:36:05.562 --> 00:36:08.479
He will never side with men if they are chaste

00:36:08.852 --> 00:36:11.713
and do not try to show off their body

00:36:11.904 --> 00:36:14.546
and show off their beauty and want to make,

00:36:14.778 --> 00:36:17.083
sort of, a capital out of it.

00:36:20.135 --> 00:36:23.891
Such women are extremely powerful,

00:36:25.379 --> 00:36:27.913
extremely powerful, and they show their valour

00:36:28.191 --> 00:36:29.717
when it comes to anything

00:36:29.868 --> 00:36:33.378
like we had Jhansi ki Rani. She was an ordinary housewife.

00:36:33.855 --> 00:36:35.277
She fought the British.

00:36:35.484 --> 00:36:37.224
And the British also

00:36:37.645 --> 00:36:39.901
were surprised at her valour and they said that

00:36:40.028 --> 00:36:41.625
we had got Jhansi, alright,

00:36:42.078 --> 00:36:44.914
but the glory goes to the Queen of Jhansi.

00:36:48.016 --> 00:36:50.444
Like that we had many, Noorjahan we had,

00:36:50.675 --> 00:36:54.161
we had Ahilya Bai. We had many great women in India

00:36:54.290 --> 00:36:57.743
because of these institutions. Padmini we had,

00:36:58.843 --> 00:37:01.663
Chand Bibi. There's so many women we can mention

00:37:01.870 --> 00:37:05.260
who have been great women, who were housewives.

00:37:08.639 --> 00:37:15.405
So the woman's qualities are like the potential of the mother earth

00:37:15.636 --> 00:37:17.196
or potential of any energy.

00:37:17.347 --> 00:37:20.244
Like electricity has its potential somewhere else.

00:37:20.371 --> 00:37:22.699
You see the lights here, makes no difference,

00:37:22.977 --> 00:37:26.178
one light or two lights, but the potential is important.

00:37:27.379 --> 00:37:29.415
So one has to understand that we are potential

00:37:29.590 --> 00:37:33.560
and to preserve our potential we must have the sense of dignity,

00:37:33.809 --> 00:37:36.626
honour and righteousness within ourselves.

00:37:36.873 --> 00:37:40.457
Now men must respect their women who are like this.

00:37:40.870 --> 00:37:42.864
But men are another stupid stuff

00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:45.955
because they will not respect a woman

00:37:46.153 --> 00:37:48.727
who loves them, who is chaste,

00:37:48.921 --> 00:37:52.095
who is good, who wants them to become collective,

00:37:52.249 --> 00:37:55.250
who wants them to give, who be charitable,

00:37:55.417 --> 00:37:58.872
who wants that Sahaja Yoga should be promoted

00:37:59.024 --> 00:38:02.312
and the one who wants that her husband should be happy

00:38:02.495 --> 00:38:06.524
and joyous and that he should come to Sahaja Yoga as well.

00:38:06.971 --> 00:38:10.735
Instead of that they run after some funny, stupid women.

00:38:13.272 --> 00:38:18.536
What is there to be so attracted towards bhootish women,

00:38:19.457 --> 00:38:21.737
must be some bhoots in them, I don't know,

00:38:22.019 --> 00:38:23.471
that the way they get attracted.

00:38:24.003 --> 00:38:26.864
As a result of all this misbehaviour of men,

00:38:27.126 --> 00:38:29.278
women become very insecure

00:38:29.806 --> 00:38:32.266
and they get insecured. As a result,

00:38:32.473 --> 00:38:35.063
the men suffer and women suffer.

00:38:36.431 --> 00:38:39.709
A man who neglects his wife, and treats like that,

00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:45.158
will consequently get blood cancer.

00:38:53.179 --> 00:38:55.377
And the woman who behaves like this,

00:38:57.892 --> 00:39:02.282
in this manner and if she ill-treats

00:39:02.632 --> 00:39:06.047
her husband, will get asthma

00:39:06.653 --> 00:39:12.054
or of a very serious type of cirrhosis,

00:39:14.583 --> 00:39:18.027
could be brain damage, could be paralysis,

00:39:19.621 --> 00:39:22.645
could be complete dehydration of the body.

00:39:27.875 --> 00:39:30.518
Because left nabhi is so important.

00:39:31.661 --> 00:39:34.954
If the left Nabhi is made hectic, as you know

00:39:35.137 --> 00:39:39.821
by your running about and by jumping about and by being hectic,

00:39:40.537 --> 00:39:44.563
that left Nabhi becomes hectic and you develop blood cancer.

00:39:45.027 --> 00:39:46.554
I have always seen

00:39:46.808 --> 00:39:51.101
that the women who are thin, their husbands as jittery - why?

00:39:53.202 --> 00:39:55.760
Because the wife is all the time making him run up and down.

00:39:55.871 --> 00:39:58.262
"Do this, do that, you didn't bring this thing for me!

00:39:58.326 --> 00:40:00.883
I had asked you to bring the Coca-cola you didn't bring!

00:40:01.071 --> 00:40:03.409
You didn't do that!" As if he's the sinner all the time.

00:40:03.989 --> 00:40:07.604
And the man becomes jumpy all the time, jumpy.

00:40:08.822 --> 00:40:11.998
He gets something for the jumping

00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:15.930
and she gets something for her torturing.

00:40:16.467 --> 00:40:20.919
There's no love. There's no joy. There's no happiness.

00:40:24.624 --> 00:40:26.960
This so-called figure madness,

00:40:27.423 --> 00:40:30.732
which is now subsiding, thank God. It's coming from America now.

00:40:31.116 --> 00:40:36.062
It's subsiding. This figure madness makes you funny.

00:40:39.212 --> 00:40:41.830
Women have to be settled down women.

00:40:43.074 --> 00:40:45.074
They have to be Grahasthis,

00:40:45.306 --> 00:40:47.797
that is, 'The one who settles in the household'.

00:40:48.062 --> 00:40:50.435
Said to be satisfied with her household.

00:40:50.954 --> 00:40:52.868
If she is all the time running about,

00:40:52.971 --> 00:40:54.552
she doesn't want to stay in the house

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.865
then she is not a housewife, but she is a maid servant.

00:41:01.294 --> 00:41:06.072
There is a saying that there was a lady who was a maid servant,

00:41:06.302 --> 00:41:08.487
and then she was made a housewife

00:41:08.837 --> 00:41:10.903
but she could not stop her running about

00:41:11.094 --> 00:41:12.999
because she was a maid servant.

00:41:14.877 --> 00:41:16.792
She doesn't settle in the household.

00:41:17.070 --> 00:41:20.969
Now for whom is the household, is not only for herself,

00:41:21.117 --> 00:41:24.441
No, not for her husband, no, not for her children

00:41:24.764 --> 00:41:26.859
but for others to welcome.

00:41:27.558 --> 00:41:30.577
Like this Mother Earth has spread all these beautiful things for you

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:33.021
to come and sit and enjoy.

00:41:34.116 --> 00:41:36.581
But is a very common thing, also that in Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:36.692 --> 00:41:39.488
we find that people, after marriage,

00:41:39.624 --> 00:41:43.889
become absolutely engrossed into each other and lose Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:45.379 --> 00:41:49.031
Then their children suffer. Their children become fussy, funny

00:41:49.325 --> 00:41:52.549
and disobedient, torturesome.

00:41:53.505 --> 00:41:57.765
They have some physical problems also - is a punishment.

00:41:59.353 --> 00:42:00.873
Not that I punish this,

00:42:01.037 --> 00:42:03.417
but it is your own nature that punishes - supposing you

00:42:03.526 --> 00:42:06.468
put your hand in the fire, it will burn.

00:42:06.707 --> 00:42:09.722
I mean who is punishing? You are punishing yourself!

00:42:12.706 --> 00:42:15.282
Then children become funny.

00:42:17.076 --> 00:42:19.392
Just for your family, just for your food,

00:42:19.501 --> 00:42:23.020
just for your household, this selfishness,

00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:27.426
if it crawls up into man, then God save that family.

00:42:27.643 --> 00:42:30.570
If it's a woman, its alright, at least a little bit

00:42:31.039 --> 00:42:33.542
but if the man is a gone case,

00:42:37.194 --> 00:42:39.544
that I should have a house, I should have a job,

00:42:39.689 --> 00:42:43.035
I should look after my children, it's for my family.

00:42:44.456 --> 00:42:49.057
Our family is not of one man one woman

00:42:49.417 --> 00:42:51.913
but the whole universe is our family.

00:42:54.293 --> 00:42:56.665
We are not on our own,

00:42:57.314 --> 00:43:00.791
and if you become arbitrary, and if you become secluded.

00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:04.302
I must tell you one thing and warn you today

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.346
that-  those people who will try to seclude themselves,

00:43:07.713 --> 00:43:09.148
a day will come,

00:43:09.350 --> 00:43:13.879
when they will have horrid diseases on them don't blame Sahaja Yoga!

00:43:14.709 --> 00:43:19.721
Sahaja Yoga has it's own beautiful realm of God's Kingdom.

00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:22.743
But in the God's Kingdom, you have to be collective.

00:43:25.626 --> 00:43:29.896
But a bad wife can create problems because she's..[INAUDIBLE]

00:43:30.090 --> 00:43:33.877
and she'll create a problem she'll form a group of people,

00:43:33.994 --> 00:43:35.220
group of women,

00:43:35.445 --> 00:43:39.528
she'll go on rolling down with her bhoots to everyone.

00:43:46.342 --> 00:43:49.105
Or may be she's very conscious of her education

00:43:49.242 --> 00:43:52.869
may be conscious of her position or of her money and all that -

00:43:53.079 --> 00:43:56.642
then also she will try to keep the husband aloof.

00:44:00.563 --> 00:44:03.867
Such people have to pay for what they have done.

00:44:04.019 --> 00:44:07.307
Not because it is a punishment from God.

00:44:10.963 --> 00:44:14.462
So Gruhalakshmi tattva in Sahaja Yoga is very important.

00:44:16.164 --> 00:44:21.009
Those people who have got problems after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:44:21.175 --> 00:44:25.113
most of them have neglected their Gruhalakshmi principle.

00:44:29.352 --> 00:44:33.002
Because Gruhalakshmi, if it goes out, then centre heart catches.

00:44:35.395 --> 00:44:38.382
Those women who have tried such tricks,

00:44:39.268 --> 00:44:42.370
should give up immediately because it's very indignified.

00:44:42.486 --> 00:44:44.562
Nobody respects such a woman.

00:44:46.090 --> 00:44:49.278
It's very true with the leaders' wives and the leaders.

00:44:50.598 --> 00:44:52.876
The leader's wife or the leadership

00:44:52.992 --> 00:45:00.550
is a minimal of a minimal of a minimal  of a so-called position.

00:45:01.272 --> 00:45:03.262
Most insignificant.

00:45:05.554 --> 00:45:09.536
What you got is much higher than this.

00:45:11.576 --> 00:45:16.452
If you ask a saint to become a king. He'll say, What?

00:45:17.063 --> 00:45:19.552
You want to put the ocean into a cup?

00:45:25.725 --> 00:45:27.463
Is the minimal of minimal.

00:45:27.816 --> 00:45:29.490
Is the lowest of lowest.

00:45:29.807 --> 00:45:33.644
Those who think their life is service are another stupid people.

00:45:35.143 --> 00:45:37.704
Their life is enjoyment, not service.

00:45:39.946 --> 00:45:42.983
But that service itself is enjoyment.

00:45:44.172 --> 00:45:46.126
But if you just keep to service.

00:45:46.365 --> 00:45:50.440
"Oh, I am sacrificing, this is my tapasya!" Finished!

00:45:51.484 --> 00:45:56.966
Then you end up like a tapasvi,
with like a beanstalk [figure] - thin.

00:45:57.636 --> 00:45:59.771
You can be used for a cross!

00:46:04.938 --> 00:46:07.258
So, in Sahaja Yoga it is enjoyment but,

00:46:07.393 --> 00:46:11.105
unless and until you have that essence

00:46:11.232 --> 00:46:14.633
of enjoyment into everything, it cannot be an enjoyment.

00:46:16.573 --> 00:46:21.588
If you take out the essence from the cane sugar

00:46:22.786 --> 00:46:26.754
or what you call the sugar cane bamboo,

00:46:27.247 --> 00:46:29.043
then what is left?

00:46:30.123 --> 00:46:33.245
In the same way, all the so-called service

00:46:33.348 --> 00:46:35.723
and seva and tapasya

00:46:35.946 --> 00:46:39.210
and all that has no sweetness in it,  finished.

00:46:41.230 --> 00:46:44.280
So the essence of all this is sweetness

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:48.413
and that is generated by women.

00:46:50.452 --> 00:46:52.809
But they are very strict. "Don't spoil this.

00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:54.905
Keep this nice, keep that nice."

00:46:55.073 --> 00:46:58.456
The husband comes home like as if like a criminal, you know.

00:47:03.989 --> 00:47:07.409
He has to be like a bull in a china shop, he has to be.

00:47:08.463 --> 00:47:10.606
It's a good thing in a way.

00:47:11.813 --> 00:47:15.903
Is nice, how he doesn't know anything, is even better for you.

00:47:20.324 --> 00:47:22.532
But to make him all the time slave,

00:47:22.651 --> 00:47:25.460
"Do this! You didn't do this for me! Do that for me!",

00:47:25.623 --> 00:47:27.844
Is not the job of a housewife!

00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:37.087
Her job is like the Mother Earth. Does She complain?
Nothing.

00:47:38.325 --> 00:47:39.690
She gives you everything.

00:47:39.786 --> 00:47:42.896
So much is the sustenance in [UNCLEAR]. So dignity.

00:47:43.474 --> 00:47:44.992
Such powers She has.

00:47:45.151 --> 00:47:48.072
What does She care for anybody giving her anything?

00:47:48.567 --> 00:47:52.235
You will be amazed if I tell you today, till today, till yesterday,

00:47:52.331 --> 00:47:56.056
I never asked my husband to buy me anything.

00:47:56.282 --> 00:48:00.704
For the first time I asked him to buy me a camera,

00:48:00.827 --> 00:48:03.414
and you see the result, in the evening what he said.

00:48:03.621 --> 00:48:05.211
Least expected!

00:48:07.176 --> 00:48:09.080
Never in life-time.

00:48:10.358 --> 00:48:12.369
He used to say, "You must tell me what you want".

00:48:12.575 --> 00:48:14.662
First time, I said something and see the effect.

00:48:14.766 --> 00:48:17.289
Because I've never said to him!

00:48:20.074 --> 00:48:23.375
So such a woman has to be self-satisfied,

00:48:23.558 --> 00:48:26.068
satisfied within herself because she has to give.

00:48:26.167 --> 00:48:29.048
The person who has to give, how can she demand?

00:48:29.250 --> 00:48:31.955
She has to give love because she is love.

00:48:32.476 --> 00:48:34.975
She has to give all the services.

00:48:35.095 --> 00:48:37.017
She has to give all the possessions;

00:48:37.160 --> 00:48:40.472
she has to sooth down. What a responsibility, I tell you,

00:48:40.592 --> 00:48:42.547
what a responsibility!

00:48:43.428 --> 00:48:46.645
More than a Prime Minister, more than any king or anyone,

00:48:46.815 --> 00:48:48.545
is the responsibility of a woman,

00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:51.873
and she should feel proud of it,
that such a responsibility has come to me.

00:48:52.604 --> 00:48:53.976
A housewife

00:48:54.128 --> 00:48:57.643
has much more responsibility than a leader of Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:58.640 --> 00:49:02.872
But the wives of leaders can be horrid

00:49:04.559 --> 00:49:06.598
because they think they have become leaders.

00:49:06.749 --> 00:49:08.315
I mean, this is the minimal of minimum.

00:49:08.434 --> 00:49:12.024
I mean it's like, I said, the ocean coming into a little cup.

00:49:14.155 --> 00:49:18.047
And their behaviour becomes so funny and absurd, I am surprised.

00:49:18.626 --> 00:49:22.607
I was married in a family where we had 100 people living together

00:49:26.541 --> 00:49:30.012
and each one of them adores Me.

00:49:30.544 --> 00:49:32.960
If I go somewhere in Lucknow,

00:49:33.111 --> 00:49:35.391
all of them will come from all over to see  me

00:49:35.471 --> 00:49:38.592
but My husband goes, nobody comes to see him.
He always complains.

00:49:39.494 --> 00:49:43.687
He's the relation, I am not the relation,
and they come and see me, not him!

00:49:46.376 --> 00:49:48.408
If I had not given them love,

00:49:48.543 --> 00:49:50.959
if I had not given them whatever they wanted

00:49:51.392 --> 00:49:53.273
they would have not come to Me.

00:49:54.746 --> 00:49:58.850
So they are the preservers, preservers of others.

00:49:59.148 --> 00:50:02.052
They don't have to preserve things for themselves.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:07.486
And we have many stupid women with us, I tell you,

00:50:07.621 --> 00:50:09.251
many stupid women.

00:50:09.704 --> 00:50:13.102
We call them buddhu (idiot) in Hindi language, the buddhus.

00:50:15.267 --> 00:50:18.235
Because they don't know what power they have got.

00:50:21.719 --> 00:50:24.925
They don't know what responsibility they have.

00:50:26.659 --> 00:50:28.929
I'm an example before them.

00:50:33.210 --> 00:50:36.828
And this is the very big problem with Me that practically

00:50:37.122 --> 00:50:40.314
I think 60% leaders have horrible wives.

00:50:40.506 --> 00:50:42.937
I must say, horrible.

00:50:45.451 --> 00:50:48.006
And Sahajayoga goes dhap like that with them.

00:50:49.034 --> 00:50:50.954
They can't live in an ashram,

00:50:51.089 --> 00:50:54.212
they will have their food,
the husband must see that they have their food.

00:50:54.331 --> 00:50:57.159
But it is they who have to feed everyone,

00:50:57.342 --> 00:51:00.931
everybody has to be looked after and at the end they should eat.

00:51:04.535 --> 00:51:07.995
Everybody must get a bed, they must see everybody is sleeping now,

00:51:08.146 --> 00:51:11.068
they must cover all the children, everything, then they must sleep.

00:51:14.006 --> 00:51:15.243
But no, they sit down,

00:51:15.379 --> 00:51:18.180
they become mini-matajis or greater-than-matajis.

00:51:18.863 --> 00:51:21.564
"Get me this thing! Get me that!

00:51:21.699 --> 00:51:23.559
Just do that! Do this!"

00:51:27.987 --> 00:51:30.335
They don't know how to cook, most of them.

00:51:31.364 --> 00:51:35.117
Every wife of a leader

00:51:35.366 --> 00:51:40.262
has to cook and learn cooking. It's compulsory now.

00:51:45.031 --> 00:51:47.824
They have to cook. And with heart.

00:51:48.296 --> 00:51:52.390
They should be able to cook and give with love to others.

00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:55.420
That's the minimum of Annapurna.

00:51:57.946 --> 00:52:00.850
And the husband shouldn't find faults with them.

00:52:01.125 --> 00:52:04.143
In the beginning they might make mistakes then encourage.

00:52:04.453 --> 00:52:07.527
Encourage their qualities, encourage their goodness,

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:09.855
encourage their niceness.

00:52:10.157 --> 00:52:12.613
Also I have seen, some very good ladies

00:52:12.685 --> 00:52:15.567
who were taking very active life in Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:15.671 --> 00:52:16.928
After marriage they are lost.

00:52:16.992 --> 00:52:20.197
Husbands are also supposed to be Sahaja Yogis - lost.

00:52:22.395 --> 00:52:26.220
Sometimes they appear, sometimes if I am there they come,
otherwise they are not there.

00:52:27.199 --> 00:52:31.043
Today I was asking Arneau,
he told Me so many of them are like that here.

00:52:31.951 --> 00:52:34.771
That means there's something wrong with the husbands

00:52:36.179 --> 00:52:38.496
because before marriage they were better off.

00:52:40.051 --> 00:52:44.653
So how much it is important, a Gruhalakshmi Principle within us,

00:52:45.066 --> 00:52:46.952
for us to be together,

00:52:47.215 --> 00:52:50.405
to us to grow together, to feel the togetherness,

00:52:50.654 --> 00:52:53.153
all the time, the oneness that is within us.

00:52:53.826 --> 00:52:57.294
So yesterday, as I told you, that I'll tell you about

00:52:57.453 --> 00:52:59.111
the Ragas we have.

00:52:59.342 --> 00:53:01.156
Ra is energy.

00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:05.796
Ga is in Sanskrit language ‘Ga - Geti’ (ग गेती )  means 'which penetrates',

00:53:05.955 --> 00:53:07.296
'which moves into everything',

00:53:08.479 --> 00:53:11.521
it's the etheric qualities,

00:53:12.408 --> 00:53:14.352
etheric, into which you see,

00:53:14.519 --> 00:53:17.392
you put anything in the ether and  you can receive it anywhere.

00:53:18.202 --> 00:53:22.649
So the Raga, is the energy which goes into ether

00:53:24.178 --> 00:53:26.614
and touches your spirit.

00:53:28.506 --> 00:53:29.950
That is the Raga.

00:53:30.580 --> 00:53:36.052
And these Ragas, I would say are something like a housewife.

00:53:41.101 --> 00:53:45.156
Supposing if you stand with a military band

00:53:45.623 --> 00:53:48.836
you will be fed up, "left right, left right, left right".

00:53:50.674 --> 00:53:54.771
But a beautiful melody that's a melodious thing, melody.

00:53:54.981 --> 00:53:59.831
And this melody itself is suggestive of a beauty.

00:54:01.503 --> 00:54:04.685
The way the housewife decorates the house,

00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:09.277
she smoothes down everyone, makes them feel happy.

00:54:09.488 --> 00:54:11.433
then she's looking after everyone.

00:54:11.513 --> 00:54:13.632
Everybody knows she is standing there.

00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:17.914
Imagine, like a modern style would be, you call

00:54:18.177 --> 00:54:21.735
some people for birthday cake of your child

00:54:21.989 --> 00:54:24.064
and you cut the cake first

00:54:25.009 --> 00:54:26.956
because you are the housewife.

00:54:27.822 --> 00:54:31.420
How will it look? It is that ridiculous, I tell you.

00:54:32.296 --> 00:54:35.632
The way the housewife always puts forward before everybody else.

00:54:35.902 --> 00:54:39.175
They have to be on the back because you have to look after.

00:54:41.172 --> 00:54:43.191
Look after all of them,

00:54:44.620 --> 00:54:49.070
and this is what is a Raga is.

00:54:49.132 --> 00:54:53.741
It caters to all your angularities.

00:54:53.845 --> 00:54:56.966
Supposing a person is very upset and worried,

00:54:57.054 --> 00:54:59.723
comes from office, sits down, puts on a Raga.

00:55:00.513 --> 00:55:02.139
It soothes you down.

00:55:03.898 --> 00:55:06.112
It makes you settle down.

00:55:06.858 --> 00:55:12.054
Like people come home for five days, live like

00:55:12.637 --> 00:55:14.977
I don't know, what to call, not even hotels,

00:55:15.242 --> 00:55:18.188
and live in a tent-like thing

00:55:18.339 --> 00:55:21.437
and the sixth day they are out at the sea

00:55:22.202 --> 00:55:24.075
or they go and stay in a hotel.

00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.721
Nobody wants to stay in the house

00:55:27.293 --> 00:55:30.518
because there is no Gruhalakshmi principle between the two.

00:55:33.283 --> 00:55:36.875
But Raga needs better this  sitting down, settling down.

00:55:37.070 --> 00:55:40.187
Unless and until you settle down, you cannot enjoy Raga.

00:55:40.302 --> 00:55:43.976
Imagine somebody listening to a Raga when he's a jumpy.

00:55:46.266 --> 00:55:47.990
So, one has to settle down

00:55:48.395 --> 00:55:53.813
and that settling down is what is the work of a woman

00:55:54.092 --> 00:55:55.713
who is a housewife,

00:55:56.016 --> 00:55:59.581
and the man has to act, is to settle down.

00:56:00.179 --> 00:56:03.958
As I have told you many a times how your left Nabhi goes out

00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.040
in the modern times, much more,

00:56:06.483 --> 00:56:11.028
and many children are also born of the women who are hectic.

00:56:11.421 --> 00:56:13.412
Is that the wife...

00:56:14.162 --> 00:56:17.251
normally in India before, you see,

00:56:17.331 --> 00:56:19.619
the husband used to get up, have his bath,

00:56:19.849 --> 00:56:21.971
all the time his wife is not with him.

00:56:22.233 --> 00:56:25.108
She is cooking for him. She is looking after the children.

00:56:25.408 --> 00:56:29.386
All the time sticking on to husband also is a sign of boredom.

00:56:30.101 --> 00:56:32.635
Husband gets bored, the wife gets bored,

00:56:32.963 --> 00:56:34.645
then they have a divorce.

00:56:35.395 --> 00:56:38.263
So must have other interests like looking after the children,

00:56:38.421 --> 00:56:40.723
household, Sahajayoga, things like that.

00:56:41.218 --> 00:56:44.791
Then he comes from the bath, he sits,

00:56:45.460 --> 00:56:47.780
sits on the ground, in India.

00:56:47.971 --> 00:56:50.513
Now we are sitting on the tables, all right,

00:56:50.616 --> 00:56:53.538
at least sit on the tables, not on the table, but on the chair.

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:58.003
Then she doesn't tell him at this time "Why did you do like this?"

00:56:59.421 --> 00:57:01.373
Or  "This lady was quarrelling"

00:57:01.493 --> 00:57:04.161
or "I met another lady she was telling me you were this

00:57:04.275 --> 00:57:07.465
and you were that." No! She says "Let him eat his food".

00:57:08.431 --> 00:57:09.771
That's why in India

00:57:09.891 --> 00:57:11.978
if husband has to show temper he doesn't eat

00:57:12.081 --> 00:57:15.132
his food in the house or he will wash his underclothes himself.

00:57:19.341 --> 00:57:21.169
That is how, they show their temper.

00:57:21.423 --> 00:57:24.375
So then she fans the husband slowly

00:57:24.577 --> 00:57:28.229
and tells him good things, "You see, today you know why?

00:57:28.478 --> 00:57:32.519
My son got up and he said "I love my father very much".

00:57:33.221 --> 00:57:36.079
He said  "Really?" "Yes, yes, he said, he said so".

00:57:36.344 --> 00:57:39.622
And husband knows she is telling lies also,

00:57:43.414 --> 00:57:45.535
but you see all nice things, you see,

00:57:45.704 --> 00:57:48.800
and "I think better your mother is much better now.

00:57:48.962 --> 00:57:51.031
I think I'll go and look after your mother.

00:57:51.160 --> 00:57:52.763
And your sister is coming.

00:57:52.891 --> 00:57:54.867
So I think you are buying a Sari for her."

00:57:55.027 --> 00:57:57.043
All such nice - nice thing she will talk to him.

00:57:57.289 --> 00:58:01.511
So he eats his food nicely then he go washes his hands

00:58:01.797 --> 00:58:04.536
and goes in a bullock cart, not in a car

00:58:04.721 --> 00:58:06.857
where there is a jam, always.

00:58:07.543 --> 00:58:12.656
Alright, now the bullock cart is over, the fan is over.

00:58:13.097 --> 00:58:16.344
You have to be very fast. Life is fast now.

00:58:16.575 --> 00:58:18.847
In this fast thing, as I have told you,

00:58:19.046 --> 00:58:21.484
that on the periphery of the

00:58:22.773 --> 00:58:24.886
wheel you have the speed

00:58:25.121 --> 00:58:29.804
but at the axis it is not.
So the Sahajayogis have to be at the axis,

00:58:30.552 --> 00:58:34.927
and so the husband and the wife,
the left and the right side of a chariot

00:58:35.311 --> 00:58:37.431
have to be on the axis

00:58:37.654 --> 00:58:40.489
and the left is left and the right is right.

00:58:41.031 --> 00:58:43.684
Now the women always take more time to get ready.

00:58:43.835 --> 00:58:46.170
Not Me, I take less than My husband,

00:58:46.791 --> 00:58:51.102
much less than My husband, but normally. So, that is their habit.

00:58:51.645 --> 00:58:55.210
Forget it. Now women have their own habits.

00:58:55.355 --> 00:58:58.658
They are women. Women will remain women, men will remain men.

00:58:58.865 --> 00:59:01.041
Men must see their watches ten times.

00:59:01.465 --> 00:59:06.046
Women might see it once or may be
their watches are lost or out of order -

00:59:06.269 --> 00:59:07.868
if they are real women.

00:59:08.186 --> 00:59:11.338
They are not jumpy like men, they are different type.

00:59:11.754 --> 00:59:15.002
But they are women and you are men,

00:59:15.193 --> 00:59:18.107
and God has made men and women.

00:59:18.356 --> 00:59:20.254
If it was to make a unisex,

00:59:20.397 --> 00:59:22.897
He would have made unisex, He did not.

00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:27.582
So one must accept the sex is which you are born,

00:59:27.805 --> 00:59:32.476
with grace and beauty and dignity - both.

00:59:32.907 --> 00:59:35.416
And you must know this is Woman's party!

00:59:35.764 --> 00:59:38.813
In India we have these things like, you know,

00:59:38.980 --> 00:59:42.072
I was married in a family,

00:59:42.159 --> 00:59:45.170
very orthodox where they used to even cover the face and all that.

00:59:45.369 --> 00:59:48.100
So, one day, the collector, is the friend of My husband,

00:59:48.268 --> 00:59:52.254
so, he told My elder brother-in law that, why not the wife of

00:59:52.678 --> 00:59:54.537
my friend come and see Me.

00:59:55.016 --> 01:00:00.810
So he said, "Of course! of course!" So just to make it easy for Me

01:00:01.012 --> 01:00:04.355
he took leave from his office and disappeared into another town

01:00:04.594 --> 01:00:08.034
and told his wife that "See that She goes and sees the collector".

01:00:08.410 --> 01:00:10.331
See how beautiful it was,

01:00:14.242 --> 01:00:16.448
how beautiful it was,

01:00:18.770 --> 01:00:21.256
and I never felt that he was dominating Me

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:25.020
because after all that was the system of that family,
alright, its alright.

01:00:27.619 --> 01:00:31.686
But for this what you need is pure Intelligence.

01:00:32.610 --> 01:00:35.808
If the husband is a dullard he'll bring down his wife.

01:00:36.105 --> 01:00:38.909
If the wife is a dullard she'll bring down the husband.

01:00:39.227 --> 01:00:43.538
If a woman is very smart, talks well and you know she knows how to

01:00:44.457 --> 01:00:48.170
talk and impress people doesn't mean that she is very intelligent.

01:00:48.451 --> 01:00:52.572
I call that person the most intelligent who sees the benevolence,

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:59.907
the ascent and the ultimate goal.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:03.681
That person is the most sensitive,

01:01:04.174 --> 01:01:05.898
is the most intelligent.

01:01:06.281 --> 01:01:09.304
All other intelligence is avidya, is useless.

01:01:10.133 --> 01:01:12.690
Now, on this subject I think I can write a book,

01:01:12.849 --> 01:01:14.439
so, is better leave it to the book,

01:01:14.590 --> 01:01:16.711
and today let us have the puja

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:18.409
May God Bless You.

01:01:18.516 --> 01:01:20.221
Any questions?

01:01:25.913 --> 01:01:28.572
This means, I'll be spending some money!

01:01:29.988 --> 01:01:33.030
I don't know, there's no chance! I don't know when will I spend.

01:01:33.220 --> 01:01:35.839
I love to spend, I mean, everybody should love to spend.

01:01:35.959 --> 01:01:37.593
That's why the money is for.

01:01:37.707 --> 01:01:39.445
Must give to others, you see.

01:01:39.508 --> 01:01:41.564
Why the matter is there? Matter is to give to others.

01:01:41.616 --> 01:01:43.508
Just enjoy giving others.

01:01:44.607 --> 01:01:47.194
So enjoyable, to give something to others.
