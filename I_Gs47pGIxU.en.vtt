1
00:00:10.079 --> 00:00:10.109
So

2
00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:13.670
It is

3
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.530
There are so many new faces today.

4
00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.030
That I would like to

5
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.540
Give you some idea about what is Sahajay.

6
00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.819
Sermons with.

7
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.880
Anja means born.

8
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.849
Sahaja

9
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.779
That means it is born.

10
00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:46.150
It is a property or it is a right

11
00:00:46.599 --> 00:00:48.189
of every human being

12
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.110
to be united

13
00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:51.069
with

14
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.560
God Almighty.

15
00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.200
Now when I take the name of God Almighty,

16
00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:02.799
all the scientists will immediately say that Matai

17
00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:05.550
you have already a conception in your mind

18
00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:07.269
that there is God.

19
00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.800
How are we to believe that there is God?

20
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.360
Surge is the method.

21
00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:18.610
Is the style is a process.

22
00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:20.629
By which

23
00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:26.790
You become connected with the divine powers which we call

24
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.500
as unconscious

25
00:01:28.779 --> 00:01:29.370
mind

26
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.440
in the psychological terminology.

27
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.389
They believe in the unconscious mind but not in the in God.

28
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.980
All right,

29
00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.239
let us forget God.

30
00:01:39.989 --> 00:01:41.639
So this is a method by

31
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.879
which you jump into your ache.

32
00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:49.650
We have to think

33
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:51.930
As all scientists

34
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.269
Have to keep their minds open.

35
00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:56.879
To understand

36
00:01:57.379 --> 00:02:01.599
why from amoeba stage to this human stage we have arrived,

37
00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.279
how is it no scientist has ever bothered to know why.

38
00:02:07.879 --> 00:02:09.149
How is different?

39
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.789
They might decide how it happened,

40
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.240
but why?

41
00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:19.779
What is the reason?

42
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.229
Have we reached the ultimate,

43
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.429
the destination,

44
00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.550
or we are still in the transition stage?

45
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.559
Definitely in knowledge we have not reached the ultimate.

46
00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:36.589
This all the scientists have to accept.

47
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.100
If you are a doctor,

48
00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.970
you will know that we do not know anything about parasympathetic nervous system.

49
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.800
You call it sympathetic,

50
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.399
supposing I say that is the system which is worked by God,

51
00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:52.050
you get a shot.

52
00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:57.800
But you do not know anything about parasympathetic.

53
00:02:58.729 --> 00:03:00.320
You do not know many things.

54
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:03.889
You cannot explain many things.

55
00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:06.860
Perhaps

56
00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:08.720
we are in the transition

57
00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:13.089
in such a stage that the knowledge is not complete with us.

58
00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.789
I mean,

59
00:03:15.869 --> 00:03:17.559
at least this much of hypothesis,

60
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.800
every scientist must accept.

61
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.750
Rule out God.

62
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:31.350
But you cannot rule out unconscious minds

63
00:03:31.679 --> 00:03:33.320
about which all the scientists,

64
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.039
all the

65
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.119
psychologists are talking.

66
00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.169
That there is an unconscious mind,

67
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.399
which is universally conscious,

68
00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.220
which acts universally in our dreams.

69
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.679
And gives us symbols which are universally the same.

70
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.330
They cannot explain.

71
00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:58.990
Some introspection is needed.

72
00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:03.880
Some introspection is needed.

73
00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:07.690
To find out why.

74
00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:14.750
Human beings are really very busy with something very unimportant according to me.

75
00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.339
But if we are in transition.

76
00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.910
If there is a goal

77
00:04:23.809 --> 00:04:25.000
where we have to reach.

78
00:04:26.549 --> 00:04:30.260
Then whatever is our knowledge is not complete is partial,

79
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.869
and we have not to accept it as the complete and ultimate.

80
00:04:35.149 --> 00:04:36.339
And absolutely

81
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:43.459
So we

82
00:04:45.429 --> 00:04:46.750
Accept that

83
00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:48.790
it's not yet completely known.

84
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.609
In the countries which are called

85
00:04:52.899 --> 00:04:54.089
as developed countries,

86
00:04:54.179 --> 00:04:54.739
so called.

87
00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.399
Where our fear has come so much.

88
00:04:59.679 --> 00:05:02.070
Where people are materially well off,

89
00:05:02.679 --> 00:05:04.760
we find there are more suicides.

90
00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:09.670
More unhappiness than among people who are stuck.

91
00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.660
The starving

92
00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:13.420
people want to exist

93
00:05:13.709 --> 00:05:15.470
and the overfed want to kill them.

94
00:05:18.609 --> 00:05:22.209
That means they have not yet achieved the satisfaction of living.

95
00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:24.380
That

96
00:05:25.239 --> 00:05:25.779
Clear.

97
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:30.220
So is there something that is beyond

98
00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.850
It's such a contradiction with which human beings live

99
00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:36.839
all the time.

100
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.480
For example,

101
00:05:38.549 --> 00:05:40.220
in the house of every Indian,

102
00:05:40.239 --> 00:05:41.089
you will find

103
00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:43.179
a Ganesha's murti there.

104
00:05:43.429 --> 00:05:44.329
If he's a Christian,

105
00:05:44.429 --> 00:05:45.440
Christ Murti there,

106
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:46.640
if he's a Muslim,

107
00:05:46.869 --> 00:05:48.190
he'll have Kuran Sharif,

108
00:05:48.309 --> 00:05:49.339
or he'll do Namas.

109
00:05:50.739 --> 00:05:53.929
On one side they believe that there is God.

110
00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.459
They read scriptures.

111
00:05:56.799 --> 00:05:57.910
They read Gita.

112
00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:59.269
On the other side,

113
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:03.570
they do not want to believe also that there is God when it comes to science.

114
00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:08.519
Now,

115
00:06:08.609 --> 00:06:09.899
is there God or not?

116
00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:12.029
Is it a

117
00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.779
You should not accept me because I say so.

118
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.549
No.

119
00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:23.529
But you should not also deny me.

120
00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:26.760
If you deny me,

121
00:06:26.839 --> 00:06:28.239
that means you're not a scientist.

122
00:06:29.329 --> 00:06:30.429
If you are a scientist,

123
00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:31.829
then keep yourself open.

124
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.420
And listen to me and

125
00:06:38.309 --> 00:06:40.640
experience the actualization of what I'm saying.

126
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.350
Actualization is the word.

127
00:06:43.929 --> 00:06:44.929
Sock shop got.

128
00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.290
Actualization.

129
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.309
It's not only preaching.

130
00:06:56.429 --> 00:06:58.279
But the actualization.

131
00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:01.950
Now you may say,

132
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.369
what is actualization?

133
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:09.980
Actualization is an experience

134
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:21.029
by which alseajo logi calgary.

135
00:07:21.899 --> 00:07:22.089
So.

136
00:07:29.209 --> 00:07:33.049
Obakilojola what disturb the tasaa.

137
00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:40.989
The actualization is an experience.

138
00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:45.589
Of knowing what you are here for.

139
00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:49.839
Why you have become a human being.

140
00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.190
What is the purpose?

141
00:07:53.899 --> 00:07:56.519
Of knowing whether there is God or not,

142
00:07:56.769 --> 00:08:01.369
all the absolute questions can be answered through actualization only.

143
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:04.480
If I want to put a simile,

144
00:08:05.429 --> 00:08:08.380
if you could understand it without getting too much involved into it.

145
00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:12.339
I would say you all are like computers.

146
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.000
I think the most modern instrument is a computer.

147
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.230
You are all made very beautifully,

148
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:20.989
delicately with great pain.

149
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.250
You are made a complicated computer.

150
00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:25.820
All of you

151
00:08:27.329 --> 00:08:29.089
But you don't get any information.

152
00:08:31.529 --> 00:08:33.359
You don't give any information.

153
00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:38.289
Only thing you have to be put to the means.

154
00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:42.520
If you do not

155
00:08:42.729 --> 00:08:44.000
put this instruments.

156
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:45.739
To the main

157
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:49.380
means if you do not connect it to the electricity to the power.

158
00:08:51.299 --> 00:08:52.250
It cannot work.

159
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:56.369
In the same way,

160
00:08:56.409 --> 00:08:57.419
the computer

161
00:08:58.090 --> 00:09:02.330
cannot give the information unless and until it is put to the main.

162
00:09:04.229 --> 00:09:08.460
What is a joke is that you are a computer and you are put to the main.

163
00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:11.530
Then you see the information.

164
00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:16.919
But unless and until you are put to bed,

165
00:09:17.099 --> 00:09:18.489
how am I to prove everything?

166
00:09:19.849 --> 00:09:23.169
So a vicious circle of the mind playing works out.

167
00:09:23.619 --> 00:09:24.520
You must prove it,

168
00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:25.750
prove it to us.

169
00:09:25.979 --> 00:09:27.020
Can you discuss about?

170
00:09:27.809 --> 00:09:30.820
Supposing there is a computer which is not put to the main,

171
00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:32.630
while discussing about it,

172
00:09:32.650 --> 00:09:35.330
let me put to the mail and then I'll show you how it works.

173
00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.859
This is

174
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.619
a very simple thing which a scientist has to accept.

175
00:09:46.659 --> 00:09:47.580
For one reason

176
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:52.080
That scientists among themselves.

177
00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:54.940
I'm not

178
00:09:55.849 --> 00:09:57.169
Dealing with one person.

179
00:09:59.539 --> 00:10:02.380
A medical scientist is dealing with the body.

180
00:10:03.539 --> 00:10:04.530
Curing the body.

181
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.479
While another scientist is dealing with the psyche.

182
00:10:13.859 --> 00:10:14.979
Another one

183
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.679
is

184
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:17.070
dealing with

185
00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:21.200
Say we can say that one has one eye to be dealt with,

186
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.270
another has another eye to be dealt with.

187
00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:23.909
It's,

188
00:10:23.919 --> 00:10:25.869
it's analytical

189
00:10:26.429 --> 00:10:26.760
process.

190
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:29.729
How do you explain love?

191
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.070
From where does it come?

192
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.000
How do you explain so many things?

193
00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:42.500
If you start analysing love,

194
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:43.590
then love dies.

195
00:10:46.929 --> 00:10:48.690
If you start analysing a man,

196
00:10:48.859 --> 00:10:49.469
he dies.

197
00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:54.159
How to deal with it

198
00:10:54.330 --> 00:10:55.090
is the problem.

199
00:10:58.419 --> 00:10:59.239
There is a very,

200
00:10:59.289 --> 00:10:59.809
very

201
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.159
Extremely simple way of looking at it all.

202
00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:08.229
From amoeba to human beings you have become

203
00:11:08.229 --> 00:11:11.309
is an accepted fact by all the scientists,

204
00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:11.799
all right.

205
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:15.530
But who has done this job?

206
00:11:15.739 --> 00:11:16.659
Have you done it?

207
00:11:17.059 --> 00:11:17.989
Have you done it?

208
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:21.380
You are just human beings without doing any job about it.

209
00:11:23.539 --> 00:11:25.219
Maybe somebody has done it for you.

210
00:11:26.090 --> 00:11:26.650
Maybe.

211
00:11:27.340 --> 00:11:28.679
You're not aware of it.

212
00:11:30.169 --> 00:11:32.320
How did you become a human being from amoeba?

213
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.080
Without your knowledge,

214
00:11:36.369 --> 00:11:38.090
without any effort being put in,

215
00:11:38.409 --> 00:11:39.849
you just became human beings.

216
00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.960
So maybe there is a chance that you will become that human being,

217
00:11:49.549 --> 00:11:51.380
that computer which is working.

218
00:11:52.429 --> 00:11:53.590
By some

219
00:11:54.090 --> 00:11:54.820
method

220
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:56.989
which you cannot do yourself.

221
00:12:00.549 --> 00:12:03.109
What man can do is to rationalise everything.

222
00:12:04.330 --> 00:12:06.359
Rationality he can think about it.

223
00:12:07.369 --> 00:12:08.849
But by thinking,

224
00:12:09.539 --> 00:12:11.200
Through this rational mind,

225
00:12:11.229 --> 00:12:12.179
which is limited,

226
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:15.340
you cannot jump into something that is unlimited.

227
00:12:17.909 --> 00:12:19.960
So you cannot work out that process.

228
00:12:22.190 --> 00:12:24.820
But it's too much for human ego to accept

229
00:12:25.030 --> 00:12:27.030
that how is it we cannot do anything about God.

230
00:12:27.070 --> 00:12:28.340
We'll stand on our heads.

231
00:12:28.429 --> 00:12:29.150
We'll do everything.

232
00:12:29.229 --> 00:12:30.239
We'll take Sanaa,

233
00:12:30.309 --> 00:12:30.979
we'll do this,

234
00:12:30.989 --> 00:12:31.940
we'll do that.

235
00:12:32.390 --> 00:12:33.820
Even we'll become naked.

236
00:12:34.429 --> 00:12:36.219
They think by becoming naked they'll get gone.

237
00:12:40.179 --> 00:12:43.090
All this is a mental process going on around.

238
00:12:43.969 --> 00:12:45.809
He's not going to achieve that.

239
00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.150
It is a hard job.

240
00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:49.390
It is spontaneous

241
00:12:51.609 --> 00:12:53.640
It is a spontaneous happening.

242
00:12:55.739 --> 00:12:58.210
Which is going to happen to

243
00:12:58.580 --> 00:12:59.309
many of you,

244
00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.469
not to all of you.

245
00:13:01.169 --> 00:13:02.580
Because some fishes

246
00:13:02.859 --> 00:13:03.770
came to the shore,

247
00:13:03.979 --> 00:13:04.940
not all of it.

248
00:13:06.609 --> 00:13:07.479
It's not needed.

249
00:13:13.919 --> 00:13:15.510
Out of all the seeds,

250
00:13:16.090 --> 00:13:17.609
everybody is not going to germinate.

251
00:13:18.469 --> 00:13:20.049
And all those who germinate,

252
00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:22.340
all of them are not going to bear fruits.

253
00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.679
And all of the foods that they create,

254
00:13:25.799 --> 00:13:28.210
they are not all of them are not going to be ripened.

255
00:13:29.109 --> 00:13:32.109
Some of them and some of them and some of them,

256
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:35.169
and ultimately you have the chosen ones who get it.

257
00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:40.539
So when we talk of spontaneity,

258
00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:45.229
still we should not talk of God because I do not want to bring in God unnecessarily.

259
00:13:48.239 --> 00:13:49.479
But this is happening.

260
00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:51.130
And

261
00:13:52.070 --> 00:13:54.900
We are very lucky people to be born in this great country.

262
00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:59.250
Already a lot of research has been done

263
00:13:59.500 --> 00:14:00.380
through meditation.

264
00:14:01.179 --> 00:14:03.710
And people have written about the mechanism

265
00:14:04.049 --> 00:14:05.250
that exists within us.

266
00:14:06.429 --> 00:14:08.559
The code that exists within us,

267
00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:10.359
which is applied to the maids

268
00:14:10.719 --> 00:14:12.190
and they call it asundalin.

269
00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.429
Saha yoga is nothing

270
00:14:15.679 --> 00:14:17.640
but is a sahaja kundalini yo.

271
00:14:17.719 --> 00:14:19.630
There is no other way kundaliniyo.

272
00:14:19.799 --> 00:14:21.590
Kundalini yoke is always Saha.

273
00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:27.789
All the horrible things you hear about Kundalini is not kundalini yoke,

274
00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:30.030
is the anger of Sri Ganesha,

275
00:14:30.159 --> 00:14:34.909
or you can say the anger of Kundalini for doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

276
00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:38.140
Kundalini is your mother.

277
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.750
He's with you every life you come.

278
00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:46.859
She knows all about.

279
00:14:48.419 --> 00:14:50.130
She is a residual power

280
00:14:50.659 --> 00:14:51.460
in the coccyx,

281
00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.580
in the triangular bone.

282
00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:56.679
She's waiting there

283
00:14:57.010 --> 00:14:58.080
for a moment

284
00:14:58.609 --> 00:15:02.119
when somebody who is authorised to do the job comes

285
00:15:02.409 --> 00:15:02.799
in.

286
00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.619
She raises

287
00:15:04.770 --> 00:15:05.460
herself,

288
00:15:05.669 --> 00:15:07.270
and you get the realisation.

289
00:15:11.169 --> 00:15:12.250
You get

290
00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.640
that connection with the other.

291
00:15:15.349 --> 00:15:16.869
It is spontaneous.

292
00:15:17.409 --> 00:15:18.369
You cannot do it.

293
00:15:18.450 --> 00:15:18.890
First of all,

294
00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:19.840
you must know

295
00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:21.969
it acts.

296
00:15:22.409 --> 00:15:23.210
You can feel it.

297
00:15:26.599 --> 00:15:29.000
People like Shankara Cha have described.

298
00:15:30.059 --> 00:15:30.299
Of course,

299
00:15:30.419 --> 00:15:31.539
nobody reads these days,

300
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:33.419
he really read Freud.

301
00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.289
That suits us better.

302
00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:36.729
We are modern people.

303
00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:38.369
We don't reach Ankara,

304
00:15:39.289 --> 00:15:40.929
but he has described the Chaitan.

305
00:15:42.049 --> 00:15:43.289
This is what you must see.

306
00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:51.239
In the Kali there's one thing very great is that everything is already.

307
00:15:52.719 --> 00:15:54.760
Nobody has to write anything anymore about it.

308
00:15:55.039 --> 00:15:57.109
Already written what to expect.

309
00:15:57.760 --> 00:15:59.270
What is a holy person,

310
00:15:59.479 --> 00:16:03.630
how to recognise the person who is going to give you a realisation?

311
00:16:03.960 --> 00:16:05.359
What are the symbols.

312
00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:06.789
It's already written.

313
00:16:10.450 --> 00:16:11.570
But nobody reads.

314
00:16:12.219 --> 00:16:13.559
People have no time to read.

315
00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:16.849
Back

316
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:20.000
it is the Saha yoga if you read Nanna,

317
00:16:20.109 --> 00:16:20.880
you read Kabi.

318
00:16:25.179 --> 00:16:25.859
Uri Shankara

319
00:16:27.169 --> 00:16:28.070
Only Indians,

320
00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:28.609
so many,

321
00:16:28.770 --> 00:16:29.900
even if you go

322
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:31.340
in the western side,

323
00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:32.450
you can see Christ.

324
00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:37.520
All of them have been saying the same thing.

325
00:16:38.719 --> 00:16:40.520
That you are to be born again.

326
00:16:42.299 --> 00:16:46.099
And that you have to be that personality in which

327
00:16:46.369 --> 00:16:48.570
you become one with kingdom of God.

328
00:16:50.690 --> 00:16:53.530
Even if you discard the whole lot of that.

329
00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:56.109
Still,

330
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:56.940
I would say,

331
00:16:56.989 --> 00:16:58.929
what about parasympathetic nervous?

332
00:17:02.619 --> 00:17:04.800
The doctors cannot explain.

333
00:17:07.209 --> 00:17:08.979
Why in the human body?

334
00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.790
Acetylcholine and adrenaline,

335
00:17:12.910 --> 00:17:14.250
two chemicals,

336
00:17:14.430 --> 00:17:15.390
act differently.

337
00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.680
It's more surprising

338
00:17:18.239 --> 00:17:19.579
They cannot explain

339
00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:21.829
the mode of action.

340
00:17:23.848 --> 00:17:26.628
The reason is there are some d sitting who decide.

341
00:17:28.170 --> 00:17:30.270
Another simple thing they cannot explain.

342
00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:32.260
That

343
00:17:32.699 --> 00:17:34.579
anything that foreign goes in the body.

344
00:17:35.839 --> 00:17:36.959
He's thrown out.

345
00:17:39.109 --> 00:17:40.189
is thrown away

346
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.910
as a nature.

347
00:17:45.489 --> 00:17:47.859
wants everything to be thrown out of body,

348
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:50.260
but when the foetus fixes,

349
00:17:50.550 --> 00:17:54.189
I mean enters or we can say the foetus when it is formed.

350
00:17:55.300 --> 00:17:56.780
Not only it is kept there,

351
00:17:56.819 --> 00:17:59.609
but it is also nurtured and looked after.

352
00:18:00.599 --> 00:18:04.790
And all the protection is rendered to that foetus who decides about it in the stamp.

353
00:18:07.510 --> 00:18:09.180
It is a lady sitting down there.

354
00:18:13.869 --> 00:18:14.709
There is a.

355
00:18:15.819 --> 00:18:17.020
Otherwise it's not possible.

356
00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:18.900
Somebody sitting down there who is doing the job.

357
00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:25.920
But to believe into these things is very difficult.

358
00:18:26.089 --> 00:18:28.130
It is better to say that we don't know the mode of action.

359
00:18:28.209 --> 00:18:29.599
We don't know why we don't know this.

360
00:18:30.829 --> 00:18:34.030
But now it is for the scientists to open their heads now.

361
00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:36.510
And see that sign.

362
00:18:37.469 --> 00:18:40.140
Has not reached you to the completion

363
00:18:40.550 --> 00:18:42.339
or to the absolute knowledge.

364
00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:45.489
But Sajo can

365
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:50.349
Because you become knowledge.

366
00:18:53.959 --> 00:18:55.369
The kundalini rises.

367
00:18:58.109 --> 00:19:00.920
It comes up through different chakras.

368
00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:02.359
It doesn't give you any trouble.

369
00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.170
Don't read these horrid horror books on Kundalini.

370
00:19:05.290 --> 00:19:06.390
They're all horrid people.

371
00:19:07.079 --> 00:19:08.239
They're not authorised.

372
00:19:09.099 --> 00:19:09.890
To dust them

373
00:19:11.229 --> 00:19:14.599
Kundalini can only be reasoned by the holiest of holy personality.

374
00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:17.099
The ones who respect

375
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:18.810
The womanhood,

376
00:19:19.239 --> 00:19:20.199
the motherhood,

377
00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:22.060
because she is the mother,

378
00:19:22.270 --> 00:19:24.150
those who insult the kundalini.

379
00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.349
Those who try

380
00:19:27.619 --> 00:19:28.339
to excite.

381
00:19:30.349 --> 00:19:30.369
Sex

382
00:19:31.300 --> 00:19:32.609
in the name of Kundalini.

383
00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:34.949
They are the greatest sinners,

384
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:37.359
and they will be going to hell and no other.

385
00:19:38.739 --> 00:19:41.890
At least in India we understand the value of motherhood.

386
00:19:42.699 --> 00:19:44.160
They are trying to put

387
00:19:44.489 --> 00:19:45.050
the sex.

388
00:19:46.550 --> 00:19:47.510
On the kundalini,

389
00:19:47.589 --> 00:19:48.819
which is your mother,

390
00:19:49.229 --> 00:19:50.260
would you like to do that?

391
00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:53.459
And then

392
00:19:53.849 --> 00:19:54.530
Sni Ganesha,

393
00:19:54.609 --> 00:19:56.819
who is looking after the protocol of the mother,

394
00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.160
gets annoyed

395
00:19:58.489 --> 00:20:02.099
and in that temper they develop those blisters and those horrible.

396
00:20:04.989 --> 00:20:07.500
Symptoms that they describe in their books

397
00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:09.469
and people are enamoured.

398
00:20:11.109 --> 00:20:11.949
Surprising.

399
00:20:12.069 --> 00:20:12.869
How can

400
00:20:13.150 --> 00:20:14.709
your mother be unkind to?

401
00:20:17.209 --> 00:20:18.469
How can she be?

402
00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:21.709
Troubling you,

403
00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.400
she is waiting for that moment.

404
00:20:24.410 --> 00:20:25.930
She doesn't require much.

405
00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:28.500
Except that she wants

406
00:20:28.699 --> 00:20:30.170
you to be placed in

407
00:20:30.569 --> 00:20:33.020
the presence of a person who knows the job.

408
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:39.630
Human beings are already sublimated people.

409
00:20:39.719 --> 00:20:41.599
You don't have to sublimate the sex.

410
00:20:43.050 --> 00:20:43.349
Actually,

411
00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.790
Kanini is placed much higher at the triangular boot.

412
00:20:47.959 --> 00:20:51.829
While the sex point is controlled by a centre which is much

413
00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:52.280
lower.

414
00:20:54.609 --> 00:20:54.949
I mean,

415
00:20:55.069 --> 00:20:56.459
any doctor can see this,

416
00:20:56.469 --> 00:20:58.439
that the residual consciousness is placed

417
00:20:58.869 --> 00:21:00.239
on the triangular bone.

418
00:21:00.829 --> 00:21:01.540
If it is,

419
00:21:01.709 --> 00:21:03.989
I can show you it's pulsating in your presence,

420
00:21:04.069 --> 00:21:04.780
I can show you,

421
00:21:04.849 --> 00:21:06.270
and thousands of them have seen here.

422
00:21:06.349 --> 00:21:08.150
There are many who have seen it pulsating.

423
00:21:08.859 --> 00:21:09.699
With your naked eyes,

424
00:21:09.739 --> 00:21:10.969
whether you are realised or not,

425
00:21:10.979 --> 00:21:12.380
you can see perfect.

426
00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:16.089
It pulsates.

427
00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:17.560
You can see the rising.

428
00:21:17.589 --> 00:21:18.800
You can feel

429
00:21:19.109 --> 00:21:21.459
with the stethoscope of the rising of the kumali.

430
00:21:24.209 --> 00:21:26.829
And there is no symptom of any kind

431
00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:30.219
that is described in the horror books of Kundalini.

432
00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:34.030
They have no authority to talk on Kundalini.

433
00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.880
You have to be a holy personality.

434
00:21:39.199 --> 00:21:40.689
You cannot touch God.

435
00:21:41.959 --> 00:21:43.219
If you're drinking

436
00:21:43.780 --> 00:21:45.079
And using women

437
00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:47.900
And talking of God at the same breath,

438
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:49.349
you are the greatest sinner.

439
00:21:50.270 --> 00:21:52.300
And such things will never be forgiven.

440
00:21:55.449 --> 00:21:57.089
Not by changing on your addresses.

441
00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.530
You have an authority to talk about God.

442
00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.390
Everybody starts talking about God.

443
00:22:02.439 --> 00:22:03.640
What is their authority?

444
00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.229
They don't even have a grain of holiness in them.

445
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:13.140
But at least they must have some wisdom to understand commit such sins.

446
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:16.199
To go against the powers of God.

447
00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:19.229
To behave in this way.

448
00:22:21.630 --> 00:22:22.989
Nobody is going to forgive them.

449
00:22:24.989 --> 00:22:28.300
And those who follow such foolish people also must

450
00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:31.300
know that they are just following their own weaknesses.

451
00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:35.689
They are running after these people only because they

452
00:22:35.689 --> 00:22:38.290
have weaknesses for this kind of perversion in life.

453
00:22:40.300 --> 00:22:41.229
In the west,

454
00:22:41.829 --> 00:22:45.589
people have already done these things without having any gurus or leaders.

455
00:22:46.339 --> 00:22:50.369
Here we have got very nice gurus who are also making money out of this.

456
00:22:50.699 --> 00:22:52.010
They are leaders in this,

457
00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:56.020
and today they are coming back to me that mother forgive us for what we have done.

458
00:22:58.459 --> 00:22:59.489
This is what

459
00:23:00.869 --> 00:23:02.790
A scientist has to understand.

460
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:05.540
That holiness

461
00:23:06.329 --> 00:23:08.199
is a part of human beings.

462
00:23:13.030 --> 00:23:14.229
It is a part

463
00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:17.540
Because when we talk to our children,

464
00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.010
we do not like unholy things from our children.

465
00:23:20.209 --> 00:23:21.760
We will do ourselves secretly,

466
00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:24.000
but we don't want our children to be unholy.

467
00:23:24.089 --> 00:23:24.770
Why not?

468
00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:27.959
If you think unholiness is nothing wrong in it,

469
00:23:28.739 --> 00:23:29.689
why do you do that?

470
00:23:30.670 --> 00:23:31.140
For example,

471
00:23:31.229 --> 00:23:33.050
if we know something is poisonous,

472
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.060
we tell our children not to take it.

473
00:23:36.869 --> 00:23:40.030
Even prostitutes want their children to lead a holy life.

474
00:23:41.439 --> 00:23:41.839
Why?

475
00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:45.290
Because

476
00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:46.670
they understand

477
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.510
from inside through their unconscious training

478
00:23:50.119 --> 00:23:52.079
that holiness is a part of human being.

479
00:23:54.109 --> 00:23:56.359
I don't say you have to be holiest of holy,

480
00:23:56.619 --> 00:23:59.939
but every human being has got a dharma.

481
00:24:01.150 --> 00:24:02.359
A sustaining.

482
00:24:03.069 --> 00:24:04.780
As you can see this gold,

483
00:24:05.109 --> 00:24:07.300
the gold has got a sustaining power.

484
00:24:07.479 --> 00:24:08.430
It will be called.

485
00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:13.160
Only when it is not tarnished.

486
00:24:14.109 --> 00:24:14.880
If it is,

487
00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:15.900
it is punishable,

488
00:24:15.930 --> 00:24:17.099
it is not bold anymore.

489
00:24:18.199 --> 00:24:19.050
In the same way,

490
00:24:19.089 --> 00:24:19.910
human being

491
00:24:20.489 --> 00:24:22.040
has got 10 dharmas,

492
00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.569
which he has to be there as a human being,

493
00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:26.439
otherwise he's a delinquent.

494
00:24:28.359 --> 00:24:29.800
Or he's a sick fellow.

495
00:24:31.150 --> 00:24:31.280
On

496
00:24:33.489 --> 00:24:34.239
He's a

497
00:24:35.319 --> 00:24:36.060
That's the word.

498
00:24:37.689 --> 00:24:38.569
He's a devil

499
00:24:39.630 --> 00:24:40.550
He's not a human

500
00:24:41.729 --> 00:24:44.280
The human being must have those tests.

501
00:24:45.199 --> 00:24:45.969
Simple thing

502
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:47.939
To be a human being.

503
00:24:48.930 --> 00:24:50.920
All these people have preached it.

504
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.550
It's not that I'm preaching it for the first time,

505
00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:54.280
Mama.

506
00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:57.439
He taught not to drink.

507
00:24:59.280 --> 00:24:59.930
But

508
00:25:00.219 --> 00:25:01.589
in the Islamic

509
00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.349
I don't know

510
00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:05.069
what's wrong with them,

511
00:25:05.319 --> 00:25:07.630
but if you go to this Islamic country,

512
00:25:08.040 --> 00:25:09.869
they drink like fish.

513
00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:11.930
They make poetry or

514
00:25:12.359 --> 00:25:12.949
drinking.

515
00:25:13.079 --> 00:25:15.430
There's Umar Khayyam singing about.

516
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:18.530
Drinking?

517
00:25:18.859 --> 00:25:20.099
You just cannot imagine.

518
00:25:21.630 --> 00:25:22.739
Christ has said

519
00:25:23.109 --> 00:25:25.180
that don't go near the spirit.

520
00:25:25.589 --> 00:25:26.979
Don't worry about the past,

521
00:25:27.369 --> 00:25:28.069
about the dead.

522
00:25:28.349 --> 00:25:31.530
Don't use spirit for showing off your chamatkara.

523
00:25:32.030 --> 00:25:32.939
Don't use spirit.

524
00:25:34.609 --> 00:25:35.609
But in the west

525
00:25:37.239 --> 00:25:37.739
If you go,

526
00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:40.170
you'll be amazed in London where I live.

527
00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:42.290
I've seen every 3rd corner,

528
00:25:42.319 --> 00:25:44.949
you find the negative man being planted something

529
00:25:45.199 --> 00:25:47.520
and whatever remaining we exported from here.

530
00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.150
You are very good at exporting the greatest crooks of the world.

531
00:25:53.599 --> 00:25:54.540
It's a shameful thing,

532
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:55.229
but we have done.

533
00:25:56.949 --> 00:25:58.150
And I say this

534
00:26:00.010 --> 00:26:01.069
They have cheated them,

535
00:26:01.099 --> 00:26:01.869
looted them.

536
00:26:04.609 --> 00:26:06.040
And they say they know about God.

537
00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:07.880
They're going to give experiences.

538
00:26:10.729 --> 00:26:11.920
This is what it is.

539
00:26:12.670 --> 00:26:14.420
This is what Gore Kaliba.

540
00:26:16.030 --> 00:26:17.250
Where the ras are

541
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.010
have taken birth today

542
00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.619
and are claiming

543
00:26:22.349 --> 00:26:26.449
And they are saying that we are the people in charge of religion.

544
00:26:26.819 --> 00:26:29.089
What religious thing they have done so far.

545
00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.560
How many people have got realisation from them?

546
00:26:33.770 --> 00:26:35.989
Only you go and see their powers,

547
00:26:36.189 --> 00:26:37.709
they have to give you powers.

548
00:26:38.449 --> 00:26:40.060
You are to be empowered.

549
00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:40.989
Your power,

550
00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:43.089
self must be manifested.

551
00:26:43.319 --> 00:26:47.599
That is what it is written in all the scriptures Gita Bible.

552
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.589
that

553
00:26:50.959 --> 00:26:54.109
There is nowhere written all these things that they will be doing.

554
00:26:56.920 --> 00:26:58.160
Your own power.

555
00:26:59.479 --> 00:27:01.390
Through the vibrations of Chaitanya.

556
00:27:02.579 --> 00:27:05.010
is not described only by Shankar.

557
00:27:06.780 --> 00:27:07.449
Everywhere,

558
00:27:07.619 --> 00:27:09.530
if you really go and search it out,

559
00:27:09.619 --> 00:27:10.859
this is being described.

560
00:27:15.359 --> 00:27:17.229
But people don't want reality.

561
00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:17.900
Perhaps

562
00:27:18.229 --> 00:27:19.630
they don't want the truth.

563
00:27:21.069 --> 00:27:22.670
They want some spectacular things.

564
00:27:24.119 --> 00:27:24.689
Is it

565
00:27:27.250 --> 00:27:29.160
Is it that you think that now

566
00:27:29.489 --> 00:27:32.520
in Kaga you can have a guru somewhere posted there

567
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:35.839
and in charge of your all your sins and everything.

568
00:27:36.479 --> 00:27:39.119
He's looking after you there and you do whatever you please.

569
00:27:40.229 --> 00:27:41.489
It's a very common thing.

570
00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:42.339
I'm surprised.

571
00:27:43.089 --> 00:27:43.250
See,

572
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.510
I went to Singapore

573
00:27:44.829 --> 00:27:46.839
and there were some people who came to see me

574
00:27:47.030 --> 00:27:47.500
and they said,

575
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.920
Mataje,

576
00:27:47.989 --> 00:27:49.579
we are in a very great mess.

577
00:27:49.589 --> 00:27:50.630
You must take us out of it.

578
00:27:50.709 --> 00:27:50.910
I said,

579
00:27:50.949 --> 00:27:51.619
what happened

580
00:27:51.829 --> 00:27:52.630
in Jakarta?

581
00:27:52.670 --> 00:27:54.380
We lost all our

582
00:27:55.109 --> 00:27:56.890
In Jakartasida

583
00:27:57.599 --> 00:27:59.790
in Jakarta we lost all our.

584
00:28:02.209 --> 00:28:02.760
Money

585
00:28:03.050 --> 00:28:05.250
because we were smuggling things and all

586
00:28:05.250 --> 00:28:09.239
the money smuggled whatever the textile smuggle are

587
00:28:09.569 --> 00:28:10.680
taken away by the

588
00:28:11.130 --> 00:28:11.939
government.

589
00:28:12.250 --> 00:28:12.560
I said,

590
00:28:12.569 --> 00:28:14.819
now what can I do about your smuggling habits?

591
00:28:14.849 --> 00:28:15.819
I don't understand.

592
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:17.180
But what about your guru?

593
00:28:17.369 --> 00:28:17.680
He said,

594
00:28:17.689 --> 00:28:19.410
our guru never said anything to us.

595
00:28:20.979 --> 00:28:21.930
Whatever we did

596
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.069
We had smuggling.

597
00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:25.790
We were having drinking.

598
00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.280
We were having 10 wives here,

599
00:28:27.369 --> 00:28:28.130
10 wives there,

600
00:28:28.199 --> 00:28:29.430
15 women there.

601
00:28:29.959 --> 00:28:31.329
He never said to us.

602
00:28:31.839 --> 00:28:32.469
Only thing he said,

603
00:28:32.479 --> 00:28:33.400
you give us the purse,

604
00:28:33.479 --> 00:28:33.839
that's all.

605
00:28:35.709 --> 00:28:36.560
You give us the

606
00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.060
You do whatever you feel.

607
00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:40.469
You come and touch my feet.

608
00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:43.310
Thousands of people were away.

609
00:28:44.319 --> 00:28:45.219
They will all go.

610
00:28:45.349 --> 00:28:47.579
The guru will be sitting on 7 ft high,

611
00:28:47.869 --> 00:28:50.439
and he will be going just to touch his feet or falling,

612
00:28:50.469 --> 00:28:51.390
then licking that dust.

613
00:28:53.839 --> 00:28:54.500
Because

614
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:56.469
What is the guru doing?

615
00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:58.939
He's allowing you to do whatever you like.

616
00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.390
He's not giving you realisation.

617
00:29:00.469 --> 00:29:02.140
He's not interested in anything like that,

618
00:29:02.189 --> 00:29:03.819
but he's only interested in you.

619
00:29:04.750 --> 00:29:06.630
Even if they were interested only in parts,

620
00:29:06.670 --> 00:29:06.910
I said,

621
00:29:06.989 --> 00:29:07.189
all right,

622
00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:07.750
forget them.

623
00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:10.199
You see there are another cheats and smugglers that

624
00:29:10.199 --> 00:29:13.000
thank God nowadays with emergency they're being taught,

625
00:29:13.189 --> 00:29:14.510
but this kind of people,

626
00:29:14.550 --> 00:29:15.069
they are all right,

627
00:29:15.310 --> 00:29:15.859
forget them.

628
00:29:16.109 --> 00:29:17.060
But it's not so.

629
00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:19.189
If it were only that much,

630
00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:20.829
I would have been very much satisfied.

631
00:29:20.869 --> 00:29:21.150
All right,

632
00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:21.939
forget them.

633
00:29:22.189 --> 00:29:23.859
These fools are being be fooled.

634
00:29:23.949 --> 00:29:24.550
It's all right.

635
00:29:25.569 --> 00:29:26.619
But it's not only that.

636
00:29:27.579 --> 00:29:29.060
But they spoil your kundalini.

637
00:29:31.030 --> 00:29:33.939
They have spoiled the line of thousands of people,

638
00:29:34.270 --> 00:29:37.099
and the chances of your realisation are very zero.

639
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:40.579
I must say absolutely nil with so many people,

640
00:29:40.729 --> 00:29:42.079
absolutely nil.

641
00:29:45.199 --> 00:29:45.859
That isn't

642
00:29:46.900 --> 00:29:47.900
This forehead

643
00:29:49.239 --> 00:29:50.219
Of man

644
00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:51.430
matter.

645
00:29:52.020 --> 00:29:53.359
Has been created.

646
00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:58.290
In so many yoni and so many.

647
00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.449
Lives it has passed through to create this human matter.

648
00:30:06.560 --> 00:30:09.829
It's a very great thing that a human being has here.

649
00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:12.339
It is not to be put

650
00:30:12.619 --> 00:30:13.300
to a man.

651
00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:20.339
Who is even lesser than you as far as the humanity is concerned.

652
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:22.469
He lives on your arms.

653
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:24.709
Will you accept a single pie?

654
00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:25.839
From me,

655
00:30:25.939 --> 00:30:26.319
if I say,

656
00:30:26.500 --> 00:30:26.640
all right,

657
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:27.430
I'll give you,

658
00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:27.739
you,

659
00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:28.229
you,

660
00:30:28.459 --> 00:30:29.989
you please have your food.

661
00:30:30.199 --> 00:30:32.150
Will you take this beggar's position?

662
00:30:32.599 --> 00:30:34.160
Will you live on other people's money?

663
00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.739
You have bowed to false.

664
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.560
And this is what is not easily forgiven.

665
00:30:45.729 --> 00:30:46.599
I'm sorry,

666
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:47.239
but

667
00:30:47.449 --> 00:30:48.650
you just can't do it.

668
00:30:49.829 --> 00:30:55.030
It is like as if in the Kundalini there's a very big wound which has been created.

669
00:30:55.219 --> 00:30:55.969
It is a fact.

670
00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:56.810
I'm telling you.

671
00:30:56.939 --> 00:30:59.969
I've seen thousands and thousands of people.

672
00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:01.489
It's the fact

673
00:31:01.739 --> 00:31:02.689
that this thing,

674
00:31:02.739 --> 00:31:04.160
if it has bowed

675
00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.160
to the wrong type of people,

676
00:31:06.790 --> 00:31:08.180
somehow God doesn't.

677
00:31:09.430 --> 00:31:11.500
One has to work very hard,

678
00:31:12.109 --> 00:31:13.339
but with some people,

679
00:31:13.510 --> 00:31:15.390
the Fundalini riser is just like this.

680
00:31:17.030 --> 00:31:20.140
The other time we had a big programme downstairs if you remember.

681
00:31:24.180 --> 00:31:24.780
We had

682
00:31:27.469 --> 00:31:29.180
Justice speaking to you,

683
00:31:29.229 --> 00:31:31.109
and he told you about his realisation,

684
00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:31.859
how he got it.

685
00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:35.339
He said that I was just sitting in front of Matajee

686
00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:38.050
and two balls of

687
00:31:38.260 --> 00:31:42.310
ice as it came onto my hand and they started melting.

688
00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.800
And the peace and the bliss started flowing into my be,

689
00:31:46.469 --> 00:31:47.630
and since that day

690
00:31:47.829 --> 00:31:51.260
I always have that flow into me and the vibrations are.

691
00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:53.810
It

692
00:31:55.739 --> 00:31:56.849
He never lost it.

693
00:31:57.489 --> 00:31:58.530
He was there.

694
00:31:58.890 --> 00:32:00.369
He's a beautiful personality.

695
00:32:02.199 --> 00:32:04.319
Because that is the justice of anything.

696
00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:07.040
Such a person can exist

697
00:32:07.699 --> 00:32:08.060
anywhere.

698
00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.109
God recognises them

699
00:32:12.800 --> 00:32:14.089
and he grants

700
00:32:14.439 --> 00:32:15.280
to the small children,

701
00:32:15.319 --> 00:32:16.469
it works just like this.

702
00:32:16.479 --> 00:32:17.469
They are innocent people.

703
00:32:19.359 --> 00:32:19.380
With some

704
00:32:20.550 --> 00:32:22.050
physical problems we have,

705
00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:24.260
we have some mental problems.

706
00:32:24.390 --> 00:32:26.119
We have some emotional problems.

707
00:32:26.310 --> 00:32:26.939
All right.

708
00:32:27.069 --> 00:32:28.459
The Pundalini rises,

709
00:32:29.069 --> 00:32:30.180
she first of all.

710
00:32:31.199 --> 00:32:33.430
Nourishes these beings within us.

711
00:32:33.939 --> 00:32:34.890
For example,

712
00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:35.979
she gives.

713
00:32:37.689 --> 00:32:38.880
Physical comfort,

714
00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:41.910
and that's how we have been able to cure cancer.

715
00:32:42.119 --> 00:32:43.760
We have definitely cured cancer.

716
00:32:45.739 --> 00:32:48.619
This I claim today and always I'll claim

717
00:32:49.260 --> 00:32:50.130
that we have,

718
00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:52.420
we have got somebody here who has been fully cured.

719
00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:53.739
That's why in here.

720
00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:56.260
That that we have not come,

721
00:32:57.189 --> 00:32:58.390
but we have here,

722
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:00.349
but we are not interested.

723
00:33:03.500 --> 00:33:05.780
Because first we have to make some doctors or surgeons.

724
00:33:07.239 --> 00:33:08.229
Let us prepare

725
00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.469
some people

726
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:11.079
to be the doctors of God.

727
00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.250
Because once

728
00:33:13.609 --> 00:33:15.040
you say I cure cancer.

729
00:33:15.729 --> 00:33:17.689
They'll say go to the cancer hospital and cure.

730
00:33:17.729 --> 00:33:18.290
Why should I?

731
00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:22.689
God can always cure.

732
00:33:23.900 --> 00:33:24.280
Then

733
00:33:25.510 --> 00:33:26.979
By giving them 2 bus.

734
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.780
First of all,

735
00:33:29.890 --> 00:33:32.160
let us have some doctors of surgery.

736
00:33:33.959 --> 00:33:35.750
So ask me for the real.

737
00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.349
Not for only physical.

738
00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:42.280
There are so many like that at the time of Christ cause the same problem.

739
00:33:43.209 --> 00:33:45.709
All his disciples started bringing all the sick people,

740
00:33:45.719 --> 00:33:47.310
and he got so fed up of them.

741
00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:50.040
That's just a byproduct

742
00:33:50.670 --> 00:33:51.270
emotionally.

743
00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.050
Perhaps

744
00:33:53.910 --> 00:33:55.599
You have come for the first time,

745
00:33:55.859 --> 00:33:58.939
but people have seen many mad people we have cured emotionally.

746
00:34:01.089 --> 00:34:02.880
Tomorrow we are going to have a

747
00:34:03.540 --> 00:34:05.079
programme for curatives also

748
00:34:05.290 --> 00:34:06.250
in the morning time.

749
00:34:07.829 --> 00:34:09.370
We have cured mentally

750
00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:10.570
upset people,

751
00:34:10.820 --> 00:34:11.688
disturbed people,

752
00:34:11.739 --> 00:34:12.810
and very,

753
00:34:12.978 --> 00:34:13.889
very sick people.

754
00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:14.889
Who

755
00:34:17.009 --> 00:34:17.648
Violent

756
00:34:19.228 --> 00:34:19.879
But

757
00:34:20.090 --> 00:34:21.280
that's not our job.

758
00:34:21.728 --> 00:34:22.610
It's a byproduct.

759
00:34:27.739 --> 00:34:28.500
We have

760
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:30.540
Just to say

761
00:34:31.719 --> 00:34:31.728
But

762
00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:34.429
If you are

763
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:35.770
seeking the truth.

764
00:34:38.819 --> 00:34:40.128
If you are

765
00:34:41.489 --> 00:34:42.289
Really,

766
00:34:42.579 --> 00:34:43.319
genuinely.

767
00:34:45.168 --> 00:34:47.168
Want to become one

768
00:34:47.610 --> 00:34:50.409
with that universal power of God.

769
00:34:52.518 --> 00:34:54.918
Then please ask for that first of all.

770
00:34:56.728 --> 00:34:58.530
Get that become a sakshi,

771
00:34:58.949 --> 00:34:59.510
become a wit

772
00:35:00.229 --> 00:35:02.340
which Krishna has preached

773
00:35:02.790 --> 00:35:03.689
that become

774
00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:04.790
the wit.

775
00:35:06.110 --> 00:35:06.709
I'm

776
00:35:06.909 --> 00:35:07.310
here.

777
00:35:08.459 --> 00:35:09.290
As your mother.

778
00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.949
Very great difference it is.

779
00:35:13.629 --> 00:35:13.979
You see,

780
00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:15.290
mother will scold you.

781
00:35:16.530 --> 00:35:17.929
She'll be angry sometime.

782
00:35:21.129 --> 00:35:24.709
But you know in your heart of hearts that she loves you very much.

783
00:35:26.530 --> 00:35:28.879
And she has tremendous patience for it.

784
00:35:29.729 --> 00:35:32.570
And she thinks of only your Kaliana

785
00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.780
and of your mosa.

786
00:35:36.110 --> 00:35:38.659
For Sergio has to

787
00:35:39.189 --> 00:35:40.189
be at this time.

788
00:35:41.290 --> 00:35:41.959
Because

789
00:35:43.659 --> 00:35:45.250
yoga is already done.

790
00:35:46.739 --> 00:35:47.800
What is that?

791
00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:52.899
In the satega people start feeling

792
00:35:53.270 --> 00:35:54.699
God's divine love.

793
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:57.239
They enter into the kingdom of God.

794
00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:01.350
How do you say that they have entered into the

795
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:05.860
kingdom of God because their awareness has changed into love awareness

796
00:36:06.229 --> 00:36:11.350
in which they collectively can feel another person when the Kundalini rises,

797
00:36:12.270 --> 00:36:13.590
when you become realised,

798
00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:14.179
for example,

799
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:16.020
this gentleman is sitting before me.

800
00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:19.479
I can feel what's wrong with him.

801
00:36:20.010 --> 00:36:21.010
Where is the problem?

802
00:36:21.169 --> 00:36:22.570
Even a child can see.

803
00:36:23.389 --> 00:36:25.010
If he is a realised soul,

804
00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:26.270
now my grandchild,

805
00:36:26.939 --> 00:36:27.699
you won't believe.

806
00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.590
She's hardly

807
00:36:30.250 --> 00:36:32.939
I would say hardly born because she's not even one year old.

808
00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:36.290
But as soon as somebody comes with the problem,

809
00:36:36.489 --> 00:36:38.050
immediately she takes out the finger.

810
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:39.780
Which is burning

811
00:36:39.989 --> 00:36:42.270
and people know that this is the thing and that is the thing.

812
00:36:43.429 --> 00:36:45.580
Supposing this finger is burning on the right hand side,

813
00:36:45.620 --> 00:36:46.330
if you ask that person,

814
00:36:46.379 --> 00:36:47.300
have you got stomach trouble?

815
00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:47.639
he says,

816
00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:47.929
yes,

817
00:36:47.939 --> 00:36:48.219
I have.

818
00:36:49.239 --> 00:36:52.199
Everybody will say this is the finger and this finger

819
00:36:52.199 --> 00:36:55.300
denotes on the right hand side is the solar test,

820
00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.600
the trouble in the solar test with little

821
00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:00.350
practise and you understand also where it is,

822
00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:03.120
then you know where it is on the liver.

823
00:37:04.699 --> 00:37:05.439
Of which

824
00:37:09.250 --> 00:37:10.800
If this finger is catchy,

825
00:37:10.959 --> 00:37:12.000
then you know in a woman,

826
00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:12.639
if it is,

827
00:37:12.679 --> 00:37:13.360
it's a uterus.

828
00:37:15.989 --> 00:37:17.100
Now what do you do

829
00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:19.510
in a now see here the.

830
00:37:20.189 --> 00:37:21.649
Question of God comes in.

831
00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:25.199
Now you see this is catching.

832
00:37:25.219 --> 00:37:25.780
What do you do?

833
00:37:26.639 --> 00:37:29.020
You immediately know the uterus is something wrong.

834
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.669
You ask the person,

835
00:37:29.709 --> 00:37:30.300
Is it wrong?

836
00:37:30.350 --> 00:37:30.620
Yes,

837
00:37:30.790 --> 00:37:32.070
you put your hand on the uterus.

838
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:36.090
You give these vibrations.

839
00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:40.679
These vibrations are the synthesis of all the powers.

840
00:37:45.689 --> 00:37:46.939
The creative power.

841
00:37:47.959 --> 00:37:50.909
The existence power and evolutionary power.

842
00:37:52.560 --> 00:37:55.949
All these three powers combined together are in this.

843
00:37:57.419 --> 00:38:00.439
So when they go to that part which is diseased,

844
00:38:00.610 --> 00:38:01.570
it gets cured.

845
00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:05.129
And the burning from the hand passes out.

846
00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:09.229
Immediately you feel all right.

847
00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.620
There's nothing wrong with the person.

848
00:38:10.699 --> 00:38:11.580
The person is all right,

849
00:38:11.659 --> 00:38:12.100
he's cut.

850
00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:13.399
Then people say,

851
00:38:13.419 --> 00:38:14.340
how can it be?

852
00:38:14.419 --> 00:38:14.899
It is.

853
00:38:17.389 --> 00:38:17.580
Now,

854
00:38:17.669 --> 00:38:18.989
how do you know that it's God?

855
00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:22.840
When you have vibrations.

856
00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:25.550
You put your hands and ask the question,

857
00:38:25.709 --> 00:38:26.629
Is there a God?

858
00:38:27.639 --> 00:38:30.669
Immediately a flow of vibration starts.

859
00:38:32.379 --> 00:38:32.699
And

860
00:38:35.449 --> 00:38:37.040
You put the question.

861
00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:39.149
Just say what's wrong with these gentlemen.

862
00:38:39.370 --> 00:38:41.949
Immediately your fingers denote these fingers.

863
00:38:42.159 --> 00:38:43.360
I'm here to decode them.

864
00:38:44.179 --> 00:38:47.060
These fingers denote different sentences in your body.

865
00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:49.600
If you study them a little bit,

866
00:38:49.850 --> 00:38:52.360
you will know that this is the matter with this person.

867
00:38:52.879 --> 00:38:54.090
Now with a little bit like this,

868
00:38:54.149 --> 00:38:55.570
even you can cure that person.

869
00:38:56.850 --> 00:38:57.810
With the vibrations,

870
00:38:57.850 --> 00:39:01.139
if you put around the aura of the person like a paraboli,

871
00:39:01.459 --> 00:39:02.850
you can give protection to that.

872
00:39:06.169 --> 00:39:10.110
All absolute questions can be answered if you are a soul,

873
00:39:10.219 --> 00:39:12.000
otherwise you cannot answer.

874
00:39:13.399 --> 00:39:16.000
But the basic problem was so far

875
00:39:16.449 --> 00:39:19.550
that all such realised souls were born at that height

876
00:39:19.810 --> 00:39:21.689
and the whole world was at that height.

877
00:39:44.530 --> 00:39:47.110
Yeah what are they talking they are turning their hands up.

878
00:39:49.389 --> 00:39:52.909
Because the vibrations are flowing and they are using manoeuvring their power.

879
00:39:57.830 --> 00:39:58.820
when he said anything,

880
00:39:59.419 --> 00:40:00.129
said anything.

881
00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:02.340
Nobody understood what he was talking about.

882
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:06.129
Time has come for you to write.

883
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.750
To

884
00:40:07.959 --> 00:40:09.350
a certain height to understand

885
00:40:10.239 --> 00:40:13.350
that beyond this there is awareness in which you start feeling him.

886
00:40:14.659 --> 00:40:16.860
That is how you enter into the kingdom of God.

887
00:40:17.719 --> 00:40:21.610
Where complete integration of your being takes place first.

888
00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:26.080
You get collectively conscious.

889
00:40:26.270 --> 00:40:27.949
You get collectively conscious.

890
00:40:28.030 --> 00:40:31.580
Now I don't know how to put it in words that you understand the meaning.

891
00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.709
You become collectively conscious.

892
00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:34.739
You are not so far.

893
00:40:35.070 --> 00:40:35.469
For example,

894
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.870
you can say,

895
00:40:35.879 --> 00:40:36.189
yes,

896
00:40:36.199 --> 00:40:36.229
yes,

897
00:40:36.270 --> 00:40:37.330
I know he's a nice man.

898
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:38.540
How do you say?

899
00:40:39.429 --> 00:40:39.860
Oh yes,

900
00:40:39.899 --> 00:40:41.530
I know he he's all right.

901
00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:43.129
How do

902
00:40:43.760 --> 00:40:44.909
Supposing you go to a doctor,

903
00:40:45.030 --> 00:40:45.260
he said,

904
00:40:45.459 --> 00:40:45.590
All right,

905
00:40:45.669 --> 00:40:47.620
I'll have to do some pathological tests.

906
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:49.020
I'll have to do this test,

907
00:40:49.070 --> 00:40:49.870
and then I'll find out.

908
00:40:49.909 --> 00:40:50.570
I'll take a,

909
00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:52.800
a surgery we can immediately say.

910
00:40:53.709 --> 00:40:56.629
That this is the chakra which is called and this is the.

911
00:40:59.919 --> 00:41:02.149
You are on top of yourself.

912
00:41:02.939 --> 00:41:04.439
Which exist in your heart

913
00:41:04.689 --> 00:41:05.719
is first time.

914
00:41:05.850 --> 00:41:07.000
Now this is very important.

915
00:41:08.429 --> 00:41:13.379
The self which is manifesting its power without your consciousness

916
00:41:13.770 --> 00:41:15.040
comes into your consciousness.

917
00:41:15.570 --> 00:41:16.760
The vibrations

918
00:41:17.290 --> 00:41:18.199
are nothing

919
00:41:18.530 --> 00:41:21.219
but the manifestation of yourself,

920
00:41:21.290 --> 00:41:21.750
which is

921
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.250
And self is the reflection

922
00:41:25.459 --> 00:41:26.100
of God.

923
00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.659
The whole complicated engineering,

924
00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:33.840
I've tried to make it simpler though whatever you may try,

925
00:41:33.850 --> 00:41:35.010
it doesn't become simpler

926
00:41:35.719 --> 00:41:37.389
because engineering of this day

927
00:41:37.929 --> 00:41:39.780
fan which is giving us comfort.

928
00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:40.679
Oh God,

929
00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:42.340
what a headache it is to explain.

930
00:41:42.959 --> 00:41:44.260
But to have the comfort.

931
00:41:45.020 --> 00:41:45.729
It's better

932
00:41:46.699 --> 00:41:47.610
Better to have it

933
00:41:48.489 --> 00:41:50.030
Then we'll talk about the engineering.

934
00:41:50.090 --> 00:41:50.449
Complete.

935
00:41:50.530 --> 00:41:51.090
I'll teach you.

936
00:41:52.290 --> 00:41:53.340
Everything

937
00:41:56.669 --> 00:41:59.729
Uta ta ta ta ta.

938
00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:04.709
The last word on all the secrets I'm going to tell you.

939
00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.399
Nothing is going to get up,

940
00:42:06.520 --> 00:42:07.360
but first of all,

941
00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.419
you get your realisation.

942
00:42:09.909 --> 00:42:10.350
Be nice,

943
00:42:10.429 --> 00:42:10.709
children.

944
00:42:13.649 --> 00:42:14.340
As I always say,

945
00:42:14.409 --> 00:42:15.800
I've done the cooking for you.

946
00:42:16.169 --> 00:42:16.969
So if you are hungry,

947
00:42:17.050 --> 00:42:17.610
just have,

948
00:42:18.169 --> 00:42:20.120
but do not have academic interest.

949
00:42:20.649 --> 00:42:23.070
Academic interest will create all these books,

950
00:42:23.090 --> 00:42:23.689
good for nothing.

951
00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:27.110
Papa Pandura kaha.

952
00:42:28.449 --> 00:42:28.639
No,

953
00:42:28.679 --> 00:42:28.709
no,

954
00:42:28.719 --> 00:42:28.800
no,

955
00:42:28.879 --> 00:42:29.229
no.

956
00:42:30.949 --> 00:42:32.060
If you have read too much also,

957
00:42:32.139 --> 00:42:33.419
it's a problem for Kundalini,

958
00:42:33.459 --> 00:42:33.620
you know,

959
00:42:33.659 --> 00:42:35.219
you have a conception of God also.

960
00:42:36.969 --> 00:42:38.199
You have conception of everything.

961
00:42:38.929 --> 00:42:39.090
It

962
00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:39.750
happened

963
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:42.139
Once it happens to you.

964
00:42:43.090 --> 00:42:45.850
Then you see for yourself if it is so or not.

965
00:42:47.169 --> 00:42:48.520
Now the time has come.

966
00:42:48.689 --> 00:42:50.050
The blossom time has come.

967
00:42:50.729 --> 00:42:52.080
Many are going to get it,

968
00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:55.080
but many won't be coming to our joke I can tell.

969
00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:55.600
No,

970
00:42:55.729 --> 00:42:56.209
they won't.

971
00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.540
Because I'm

972
00:42:59.739 --> 00:43:00.459
ahasta.

973
00:43:02.459 --> 00:43:03.689
They want a Babaji,

974
00:43:03.850 --> 00:43:05.959
a lady like a Babaji sitting here.

975
00:43:06.250 --> 00:43:08.250
She says you starve yourself for 10 days.

976
00:43:09.709 --> 00:43:11.030
Then you give all your money to me,

977
00:43:11.070 --> 00:43:12.709
of course that is 12,

978
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:14.699
2nd time you starve yourself,

979
00:43:14.909 --> 00:43:15.909
give your money to me.

980
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:17.340
I'm a Babaji.

981
00:43:17.379 --> 00:43:18.330
I've given up my house,

982
00:43:18.459 --> 00:43:19.459
but I'm taking your money.

983
00:43:20.129 --> 00:43:21.449
I've given up my husband.

984
00:43:23.149 --> 00:43:23.770
All humble

985
00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:27.429
You are not to give up anything or to take anything.

986
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:28.229
It's all myth.

987
00:43:29.879 --> 00:43:30.939
You have to be yourself.

988
00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:35.250
This is what Krishna tried to explain to us,

989
00:43:35.590 --> 00:43:36.939
but he didn't understand it.

990
00:43:37.149 --> 00:43:38.389
At least you people understand.

991
00:43:39.629 --> 00:43:40.610
Wherever you are,

992
00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:41.870
you have to become yourself.

993
00:43:41.909 --> 00:43:42.479
That's all.

994
00:43:42.669 --> 00:43:46.949
You are not to give up anything or to take anything or to do anything absurd.

995
00:43:48.489 --> 00:43:51.520
I'm just like you because otherwise you would not listen to me.

996
00:43:52.300 --> 00:43:53.370
I'm a housewife.

997
00:43:54.219 --> 00:43:54.530
You know,

998
00:43:54.570 --> 00:43:55.399
I have a husband.

999
00:43:55.489 --> 00:43:56.270
I have children,

1000
00:43:56.449 --> 00:43:57.290
I have grandchildren.

1001
00:44:01.030 --> 00:44:03.219
So because you are my children too.

1002
00:44:06.929 --> 00:44:08.959
And this is the thing men.

1003
00:44:10.090 --> 00:44:12.850
Ordinary normal married

1004
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:16.280
people or people who are householders,

1005
00:44:16.770 --> 00:44:18.689
not for the Sanibaba,

1006
00:44:18.770 --> 00:44:19.050
no.

1007
00:44:21.489 --> 00:44:23.560
All this tomfoolery is not here.

1008
00:44:25.239 --> 00:44:26.500
You are the greatest

1009
00:44:27.489 --> 00:44:28.820
Because you have children,

1010
00:44:29.050 --> 00:44:30.000
you have parents,

1011
00:44:30.330 --> 00:44:31.610
you know how to balance life.

1012
00:44:31.729 --> 00:44:32.969
You are very balanced people.

1013
00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:37.010
And it is going to act only in you and not in these extremists.

1014
00:44:38.179 --> 00:44:39.360
In India they call hago

1015
00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:41.429
was run away

1016
00:44:41.919 --> 00:44:43.000
from the societies.

1017
00:44:45.050 --> 00:44:45.919
There are some big,

1018
00:44:45.949 --> 00:44:46.479
big sayings,

1019
00:44:46.520 --> 00:44:47.030
you see.

1020
00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:48.719
They are claiming I'm this,

1021
00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:49.580
I'm that about me.

1022
00:44:49.679 --> 00:44:49.879
I said,

1023
00:44:49.959 --> 00:44:50.520
What about you?

1024
00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:51.159
Why don't you come?

1025
00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.879
Sitting in the Himala sitting somewhere in the south,

1026
00:44:55.709 --> 00:44:56.649
one from the right to be,

1027
00:44:56.919 --> 00:44:59.879
we know you have come and another one sitting down there in,

1028
00:45:00.479 --> 00:45:03.850
he says the one sitting there all claiming about me,

1029
00:45:03.959 --> 00:45:05.610
telling everybody who goes to that.

1030
00:45:05.889 --> 00:45:06.909
Why don't you come down?

1031
00:45:09.489 --> 00:45:09.840
They say,

1032
00:45:09.919 --> 00:45:10.159
oh,

1033
00:45:10.239 --> 00:45:11.590
we don't want to face them.

1034
00:45:11.879 --> 00:45:13.399
They're not going to crucify you.

1035
00:45:17.419 --> 00:45:18.500
They haven't got

1036
00:45:20.010 --> 00:45:21.729
That kind of patience.

1037
00:45:22.949 --> 00:45:23.179
Oh,

1038
00:45:23.219 --> 00:45:25.010
they will take a chimpta and hit you hard.

1039
00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:25.780
Cha chimp.

1040
00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:27.879
He tells me also.

1041
00:45:27.979 --> 00:45:28.659
They tell me also.

1042
00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:32.350
It's a mother's job.

1043
00:45:34.629 --> 00:45:36.370
It's just a mother's job,

1044
00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:39.100
and that's why it has to be a mother.

1045
00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:43.790
As Indians,

1046
00:45:43.830 --> 00:45:45.750
you're very lucky to have good mothers.

1047
00:45:48.830 --> 00:45:50.739
And that's what a mother is.

1048
00:45:51.729 --> 00:45:53.110
That she has to

1049
00:45:53.679 --> 00:45:55.669
help you to get your

1050
00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.149
realisation.

1051
00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:00.000
It is like one light which is enlightened

1052
00:46:01.729 --> 00:46:03.280
the deeper has to enlighten other deep,

1053
00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:08.270
and then the another one that is enlightened has to enlighten another being.

1054
00:46:08.959 --> 00:46:11.159
Let such Diwali be celebrated.

1055
00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.550
It is your own power.

1056
00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:13.750
It is your own thing.

1057
00:46:13.879 --> 00:46:15.090
It is your own party.

1058
00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.360
It is your own oil.

1059
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:19.159
The only thing is that my light touches your light,

1060
00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:20.270
you are enlightened,

1061
00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:21.409
and then you enlighten us.

1062
00:46:22.709 --> 00:46:24.929
And this light also connects

1063
00:46:25.219 --> 00:46:26.129
the physical,

1064
00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:27.729
the emotional,

1065
00:46:28.020 --> 00:46:30.209
and the mental being within.

1066
00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:34.010
All the conflicts are resolved and you become that.

1067
00:46:35.729 --> 00:46:37.080
A detached so.

1068
00:46:38.739 --> 00:46:39.639
Today has been

1069
00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:39.989
an

1070
00:46:40.939 --> 00:46:41.810
introductory.

1071
00:46:43.399 --> 00:46:43.729
Lecture,

1072
00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.469
I should say.

1073
00:46:45.969 --> 00:46:46.870
I hope

1074
00:46:47.199 --> 00:46:48.320
you have understood it.

1075
00:46:48.520 --> 00:46:49.520
It's an invitation.

1076
00:46:51.199 --> 00:46:52.610
You don't have to do anything.

1077
00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:53.860
You don't have to worry.

1078
00:46:54.030 --> 00:46:56.550
There are some people who are writing articles

1079
00:46:56.550 --> 00:46:59.020
after articles about all these horrid people,

1080
00:46:59.429 --> 00:47:02.189
and they said we don't want to see Mataji because we are afraid of her.

1081
00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.459
You're afraid of your mother.

1082
00:47:06.379 --> 00:47:06.919
For a mother,

1083
00:47:06.979 --> 00:47:07.939
nobody is a sinner.

1084
00:47:08.820 --> 00:47:10.060
Is there any sin

1085
00:47:10.409 --> 00:47:11.889
which is greater than my love?

1086
00:47:13.199 --> 00:47:14.040
I don't think

1087
00:47:14.929 --> 00:47:16.760
So please don't condemn your sources.

1088
00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:19.520
Just with open mind,

1089
00:47:20.479 --> 00:47:21.330
and it will work out.

1090
00:47:21.439 --> 00:47:22.530
It has worked with many.

1091
00:47:22.639 --> 00:47:24.149
It's going to work out with you.

1092
00:47:24.399 --> 00:47:26.110
We'll have some meditation for a while.

1093
00:47:26.239 --> 00:47:27.629
We'll see how much it works out.

1094
00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.360
There's nothing to be frightened of.

1095
00:47:30.169 --> 00:47:31.979
It's a wonderful experience

1096
00:47:32.399 --> 00:47:34.270
and but the only thing is after getting it,

1097
00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.560
you must understand the mechanism behind it supposing today you don't get it,

1098
00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.199
don't get worried.

1099
00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:40.790
Maybe some physical problem is there.

1100
00:47:40.919 --> 00:47:42.429
Maybe some emotional problem is there,

1101
00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.199
maybe something.

1102
00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:44.250
We'll work it out

1103
00:47:44.560 --> 00:47:46.219
so far except for one person.

1104
00:47:49.209 --> 00:47:50.959
He has been coming to me for the last 6 years.

1105
00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.070
I have not been able to give him realisation,

1106
00:47:53.479 --> 00:47:54.840
so he's a very large headed man.

1107
00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:55.590
I'm sorry,

1108
00:47:55.679 --> 00:47:58.080
but it is the only man exceptional I can tell.

1109
00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:02.540
That I have not been able to give him realisation or he has not achieved,

1110
00:48:02.929 --> 00:48:04.379
but he's the only exceptional case,

1111
00:48:04.469 --> 00:48:05.699
otherwise everybody gets it.

1112
00:48:05.750 --> 00:48:07.429
The only thing is that you have to.

1113
00:48:10.159 --> 00:48:11.080
stabilise.

1114
00:48:11.639 --> 00:48:13.949
The stabilisation takes a little time,

1115
00:48:14.159 --> 00:48:16.030
and that is what is important.

1116
00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:19.820
It stabilises if you little bit practise the way of surgery.

1117
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:24.620
Faith is not needed,

1118
00:48:24.989 --> 00:48:27.139
but also denial is not needed,

1119
00:48:27.510 --> 00:48:29.189
so you just sit with an open mind.

1120
00:48:30.649 --> 00:48:31.770
Just with an open mind,

1121
00:48:32.050 --> 00:48:32.929
and it will work out.

1122
00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:38.159
Now you should not worry what the Sahajoogis are going to do about it.

1123
00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:40.889
They might touch your head because here it breaks out,

1124
00:48:40.939 --> 00:48:43.719
you know that they may touch some of your chakras may,

1125
00:48:43.959 --> 00:48:44.469
may not touch.

1126
00:48:44.560 --> 00:48:45.959
They might give band to that.

1127
00:48:46.120 --> 00:48:47.010
They will work it out.

1128
00:48:47.199 --> 00:48:48.129
If something like this,

1129
00:48:48.209 --> 00:48:50.340
those who do not know how to swim

1130
00:48:50.639 --> 00:48:51.489
are getting drowned.

1131
00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:55.229
So those who know how to swim help the person to swim out.

1132
00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.479
But the people who do not know how to swim.

1133
00:49:00.340 --> 00:49:01.719
They have to keep quiet

1134
00:49:01.969 --> 00:49:02.959
because they don't know,

1135
00:49:03.209 --> 00:49:04.010
but once they're learning,

1136
00:49:04.050 --> 00:49:04.770
they can teach others.

1137
00:49:06.100 --> 00:49:07.250
It is like this.

1138
00:49:07.449 --> 00:49:09.080
It is going to work out that way,

1139
00:49:09.250 --> 00:49:12.399
and I hope all of you will have some experience tonight

1140
00:49:12.770 --> 00:49:13.810
because I find

1141
00:49:14.090 --> 00:49:17.520
the rate of realisation is going very fast.

1142
00:49:17.810 --> 00:49:18.469
In the beginning,

1143
00:49:18.489 --> 00:49:19.639
for 2 years,

1144
00:49:19.929 --> 00:49:23.719
I worked very hard and only 12 people got realisation,

1145
00:49:23.889 --> 00:49:26.479
and here I now find that just like this.

1146
00:49:27.620 --> 00:49:28.580
While coming from Delhi,

1147
00:49:28.699 --> 00:49:29.600
I met somebody

1148
00:49:29.820 --> 00:49:30.679
from Madras,

1149
00:49:30.820 --> 00:49:32.540
and he just came and touched my feet and he said,

1150
00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:32.939
Matai,

1151
00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:33.580
I'm so lucky.

1152
00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:34.340
I'm on this plane.

1153
00:49:34.379 --> 00:49:35.649
I was going to buy another plane.

1154
00:49:35.979 --> 00:49:37.100
Can you give me your blessings?

1155
00:49:37.239 --> 00:49:37.500
I said,

1156
00:49:37.669 --> 00:49:37.820
All right,

1157
00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:38.739
come lock sit with me.

1158
00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:40.870
And he got his relaxation within 5 minutes.

1159
00:49:41.219 --> 00:49:41.820
5 minutes.

1160
00:49:43.070 --> 00:49:43.820
It can happen.

1161
00:49:46.629 --> 00:49:47.830
If there are any questions,

1162
00:49:47.909 --> 00:49:51.270
you better ask me because later on I don't want your Buddhi to trouble you.

1163
00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:51.820
This is this,

1164
00:49:51.989 --> 00:49:53.500
but don't ask foolish questions.

1165
00:49:53.550 --> 00:49:55.179
You see this is a real thing.

1166
00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.649
If you are genuinely interested,

1167
00:49:56.669 --> 00:49:57.189
you have.

1168
00:49:58.290 --> 00:50:00.209
Don't waste the time of others because there can be

1169
00:50:00.209 --> 00:50:02.409
some negative people also just trying to waste our time.

1170
00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:03.290
So don't waste it.

1171
00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:06.129
If there's a sensible question just because later on

1172
00:50:06.129 --> 00:50:08.689
I don't want you people to feel that,

1173
00:50:08.699 --> 00:50:08.899
oh,

1174
00:50:08.969 --> 00:50:10.090
I didn't ask this question.

1175
00:50:10.169 --> 00:50:11.139
I should have asked this question.

1176
00:50:11.370 --> 00:50:12.449
There's no need to ask questions.

1177
00:50:12.489 --> 00:50:13.610
The children don't ask any questions.

1178
00:50:15.489 --> 00:50:15.989
They get it.

1179
00:50:17.070 --> 00:50:17.500
But you,

1180
00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:18.060
if you want,

1181
00:50:18.179 --> 00:50:19.260
if I mean there's any problem,

1182
00:50:19.459 --> 00:50:20.060
please ask,

1183
00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:21.739
what are any problem that you have.
