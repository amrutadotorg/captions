00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.600
[Hindi], there are so many new faces today that I would like to

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.600
give you some idea about what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:36.600
Saha means with and Ja means born.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.600
Sahaja, that means it is born with you.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:52.600
It is a property or it is a right of every human being to be united with God Almighty.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.600
Now when I take the name of God Almighty all the scientists will immediately say that,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.600
Mataji you have already a conception in your mind that there is God.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.600
How are we to believe that there is God?

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:23.600
Sahaja Yoga is the method, is the style, is the process by which you become connected

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:31.600
with the divine power which we call as unconscious mind in the psychological terminology.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.600
They believe in the unconscious mind but not in God.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.600
Alright, let us forget God.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.600
So this is a method by which you jump into your (अचेतन) Achetana.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:57.600
We have to think as all scientists have to keep their minds open to understand why from

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.600
amoeba stage to this human stage we have arrived.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:06.600
How is it no scientist has ever bothered to know why?

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.600
How is different?

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:13.600
They might be said how it happened but why?

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600
What is the reason?

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.600
Have we reached the ultimate, the destination or we are still in the transition stage?

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.600
Definitely in knowledge we have not reached the ultimate.

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.600
This all the scientists have to accept.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.600
If you are a doctor you will know that we do not know anything about parasympathetic nervous system.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
You call it parasympathetic.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:52.600
Supposing I say that is the system which is worked by God you get a shock.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.600
But you do not know anything about parasympathetic.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.600
You do not know many things.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.275
You cannot explain many things.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:14.243
Perhaps we are in the transition in such a stage that the knowledge is not complete with us.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.600
I mean at least this much of hypothesis every scientist must accept.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600
Rule out God.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:36.702
But you cannot rule out unconscious mind about which all the scientists, all the psychologists are talking.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:45.600
That there is an unconscious mind which is universally conscious, which acts universally in our dreams

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.600
and gives us symbols which are universally the same.

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600
They cannot explain.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.814
Some introspection is needed.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.629
Some introspection is needed to find out why.

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.600
Human beings are really very busy with something very unimportant according to me.

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:29.447
But if we are in transition, if there is a goal where we have to reach, then whatever is our knowledge is not complete,

00:04:29.477 --> 00:04:36.443
is partial and we have not to accept it as the complete and ultimate and absolute.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:49.520
So we accept that it is not yet completely known.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.289
In the countries which are called as developed countries, so called,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:01.600
where assurance has come so much, where people are materially well off,

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:10.525
we find there are more suicides, more unhappiness than among people who are starving.

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.735
The starving people want to exist and the overfed want to kill themselves.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.735
That means they have not yet achieved the satisfaction of living.

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.600
That is clear.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.167
So is there something that is beyond?

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.507
It is such a contradiction with which human beings live all the time.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.600
For example, in the house of every Indian you will find a Ganesha's murti there,

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:50.322
if he is a Christian, Christ's murti there, if he is a Muslim he will have kurana sharif or he will do namas.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.600
On one side they believe that there is God.

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:57.600
They read scriptures, they read Gita.

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.823
On the other side they do not want to believe also that there is God when it comes to fact.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:12.600
Now is there God or not? Is it a fact?

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.600
You should not accept me because I say so. No.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.600
But you should not also deny me.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.775
If you deny me that means you are not a scientist.

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.355
If you are a scientist then keep yourself open.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.988
And listen to me and experience the actualization of what I am saying.

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:43.050
Actualization is the word.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.508
साक्षात्कार (Sākṣātkāra).

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:49.468
Actualization.

00:06:51.558 --> 00:06:59.530
It is not only preaching but the actualization.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:04.119
Now you may say what is actualization?

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.060
Actualization is an experience by which

00:07:14.012 --> 00:07:34.085
[Hindi]

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:41.935
The actualization is an experience

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:45.775
of knowing what you are here for

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:50.395
Why you have become a human being?

00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:56.515
What is the purpose of knowing whether there is God or not?

00:07:56.535 --> 00:08:01.400
All the absolute questions can be answered through actualization only.

00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:09.150
If I want to put a [unclear], if you could understand it without getting too much involved into it,

00:08:09.370 --> 00:08:12.495
I would say you all are like computers.

00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:15.945
I think the most modern instrument is a computer.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:20.975
You are all made very beautifully, delicately, with great pains.

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:24.933
You are made a complicated computer.

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:29.263
All of you. But you don't get any information.

00:08:31.670 --> 00:08:33.670
You don't give any information.

00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:35.890
You don't give any information.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:39.040
Only thing you are to be put to the mains.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.950
If you do not put this instrument to the mains,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:50.189
means if you do not connect it to the electricity, to the power,

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:53.279
it cannot work.

00:08:55.359 --> 00:09:02.600
In the same way the computer cannot give the information unless and until it is put to the mains.

00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:09.243
What is a Sahaja Yogi is that you are a computer and you are put to the mains.

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.333
Then you see the information.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:18.600
But unless and until you are put to the mains, how am I to prove everything?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.405
So a vicious circle of the mind playing works out.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.565
You must prove it to us. Can you discuss about it?

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.805
Supposing there is a computer which is not put to the mains.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:37.585
What is this I am discussing about it? Let me put to the mains and then I will show you how it works.

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:45.600
So this is a very simple thing which a scientist has to accept.

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:58.523
For one reason that scientists among themselves are not dealing with one person.

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:05.563
A medical scientist is dealing with the body, curing the body.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:11.600
While another scientist is dealing with the psyche,

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:18.030
another one is dealing with…

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:23.560
Say we can say that one has one eye to be dealt with, another has another eye to be dealt with.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.480
It's an analytical process.

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:33.261
How do you explain love? From where does it come?

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.411
How do you explain so many things?

00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:44.581
If you start analyzing love, then love dies.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:50.405
If you start analyzing a man, he dies.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:55.600
So how to deal with it is the problem.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:05.552
There is a very, very extremely simple way of looking at it all.

00:11:05.580 --> 00:11:12.580
From amoeba to human beings you have become is an accepted fact by all the scientists, all right.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:18.202
But who has done this job? Have you done it? Have you done it?

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.449
You are just human beings without doing any job about it.

00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:29.379
Maybe somebody has done it for you. Maybe you are not aware of it.

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:33.449
How did you become a human being from amoeba?

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:41.512
Without your knowledge, without any effort being put in, you just became human beings.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:51.600
So maybe there is a chance that you will become that human being, that computer which is working,

00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:57.600
by some method which you cannot do yourself.

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:06.545
What man can do is to rationalize everything, rationality. He can think about it.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:15.960
But by thinking through this rational mind which is limited, you cannot jump into something that is unlimited.

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:21.000
So you cannot work out that process.

00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:27.370
But it's too much for human ego to accept that how is it we cannot do anything about God.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:32.573
We will do everything on our heads. We will do everything. We will take sannyasa, we will do this, we will do that.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:38.363
Even we will become naked. They think by becoming naked they will get God.

00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.600
All this is mental process going on around. He is not going to achieve that.

00:12:45.600 --> 00:13:00.549
It is sahaja. It is spontaneous. It is a spontaneous happening which is going to happen to many of you, not all of you.

00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:07.600
Because some fishes came to the shore, not all of you. It's not needed.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:23.141
Out of all the seeds everybody is not going to germinate. And all those who germinate, all of them are not going to bear fruits.

00:13:23.181 --> 00:13:28.561
And all of the fruits that they create, not all of them are not going to be ripened.

00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:36.021
Some of them and some of them and some of them and ultimately you have the chosen ones who get it.

00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:46.548
So when we talk of spontaneity still we should not talk of God because I do not want to bring in God unnecessarily.

00:13:46.600 --> 00:14:01.303
But this is a happening and we are very lucky people to be born in this great country where already lot of research has been done through meditation.

00:14:01.340 --> 00:14:10.556
And people have written about the mechanism that exists within us, the chord that exists within us which is applied to the mains.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:19.546
And they call it as Kundalini. Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is a sahaja Kundalini Yoga. There is no other Kundalini Yoga.

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:27.886
Kundalini Yoga is always Sahaja Yoga. All the horrible things you hear about Kundalini is not Kundalini Yoga

00:14:27.896 --> 00:14:36.456
is the anger of Sri Ganesha or you can say the anger of Kundalini for doing all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:52.600
Kundalini is your mother. She is with you every life you come. She knows all about you. She is a residual power in the coccyx, in the triangular bone.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:15:07.600
She is waiting there for a moment when somebody who is authorized to do the job comes in, she rises herself and you get the realization.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:23.600
You get that connection with the [unclear]. It is spontaneous. You cannot do it. First of all you must know. It acts. You can feel it.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:37.260
People like Shankaracharya have described. Of course nobody reads these days. You see we read Freud. That suits us better. We are modern people.

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:44.511
We don't read Shankaracharya but he has described the Chaitanya Lahiri. This is what you must seek.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:55.061
In the Kali Yuga there is one thing very great is that everything is already written. Nobody has to write anything anymore about it.

00:15:55.101 --> 00:16:07.691
Already written what to expect, what is a holy person, how to recognize the person, who is going to give you realization, what are the symbols. It's already written.

00:16:09.980 --> 00:16:25.858
But nobody reads. People have no time to read. That it is the Sahaja Yoga if you read Nanak you read Kabir, you read Shankara.

00:16:25.878 --> 00:16:38.447
Only Indians so many, even if you go in the western side you can say Christ. All of them have been saying the same thing.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:48.600
That you are to be born again and that you have to be that personality in which you become one with kingdom of God.

00:16:48.600 --> 00:17:00.047
Even if you discard the whole lot of them, still I would say what about parasympathetic nervous system.

00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:15.600
The doctors cannot explain why in the human body aceticoline and adrenaline two chemicals act differently.

00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:27.540
It's most surprising. They cannot explain the mode of action. The reason is there are some deities sitting who decide.

00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:42.551
Another simple thing they cannot explain that anything that foreign goes in the body is thrown out, is thrown away as a nature.

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:54.566
Wants everything to be thrown out of body but when the fetus fixes, I mean enters, we can say the fetus when it is formed.

00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:04.600
Not only it is kept there but it is also nurtured and looked after and all the protection is rendered to that fetus who decides about it in the stomach.

00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:19.600
It is a deity sitting down there. There is a deity otherwise it's not possible somebody sitting down there who is doing the job.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:29.600
But to believe into these things is very difficult. It is better to say that we don't know the mode of action, we don't know why, we don't know this.

00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:42.600
But now it is for the scientists to open their heads now and see that science has not reached you to the completion or to the absolute knowledge.

00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:50.600
But Sahaja Yoga can because you become knowledge.

00:18:50.600 --> 00:19:07.085
The Kundalini rises, it comes up through different chakras, it doesn't give you any trouble. Don't read these horror books on Kundalini. They are all horrid people.

00:19:07.125 --> 00:19:15.262
They are not authorized to touch them. Kundalini can only be risen by the holiest of holy personalities.

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:37.600
The ones who respect the womanhood, the motherhood because she is the mother, those who insult the Kundalini, those who try to excite sex in the name of Kundalini are the greatest sinners and they will be going to hell and no other place.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:50.600
At least in India we understand the value of motherhood. They are trying to put the sex on the Kundalini which is your mother. Would you like to do that?

00:19:50.600 --> 00:20:09.600
And then Sri Ganesha who is looking after the protocol of the mother gets annoyed and in that temper they develop those blisters and those horrible symptoms that they describe in their books and people are enamored.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:32.600
Surprising, how can your mother be unkind to you? How can she be? Troubling you she is waiting for that moment. She doesn't require much except that she wants you to be placed in the presence of a person who knows the job.

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:51.600
Human beings are already sublimated people. You don't have to sublimate the sex. Actually Kundalini is placed much higher at the triangular bone while the sex point is controlled by a center which is much lower.

00:20:51.600 --> 00:21:14.600
I mean any doctor can see this that the residual consciousness is placed on the triangular bone. If it is, I can show you it pulsating in your presence I can show you and thousands of them have seen here. There are many who have seen it pulsating. With your naked eyes whether you are realized or not you can see it pulsating.

00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:37.600
It pulsates, you can see the rising, you can feel with the stethoscope the rising of the Kundalini. And there is no symptom of any kind that is described in these horror books of Kundalini. They have no authority to talk on Kundalini. You have to be a holy personality.

00:21:38.600 --> 00:22:04.495
You cannot touch God. If you are drinking and using women and talking of God at the same breath you are the greatest sinner and such sins will never be forgiven. Not by changing only your dresses. You have an authority to talk about God. Everybody starts talking about God. What is their authority?

00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:23.600
They don't even have a grain of holiness in them. But at least they must have some wisdom to understand to commit such sins, to go against the powers of God, to behave in this way. Nobody is going to forgive them.

00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:39.248
And those who follow such foolish people also must know that they are just following their own weaknesses. They are running after these people only because they have weaknesses for this kind of perversion in them.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:58.441
In the West people have already done these things without having any gurus or leaders. Here we have got very nice gurus who are also making money out of this. They are leaders in this. And today they are coming back to me that mother forgive us for what we have done.

00:22:58.601 --> 00:23:24.535
This is what a scientist has to understand that holiness is a part of human being. It is a part because when we talk to our children we do not like unholy things from our children. We will do ourselves secretly. Why we don't want our children to be unholy? Why not?

00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:41.600
If you think unholyness is nothing wrong in it, why do you do that? For example, if we know something is poisonous, we tell our children not to take it. Even prostitutes want their children to lead a holy life. Why?

00:23:41.600 --> 00:24:01.600
Because they understand from inside through their unconscious training that holiness is a part of human being. I don't say you have to be holiest of holiness. But every human being has got a dharma, a sustaining power.

00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:31.438
As you can see this gold, the gold has got a sustaining power. It will be called gold only when it is not tarnishable. If it is tarnishable, it is not gold anymore. In the same way human being has got ten dharmas which he has to be there as a human being. Otherwise he is a delinquent or he is a sick fellow or he is a

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:52.600
he is a rakshasa. That's the word. He is a devil. He is not a human being. The human being must have those ten simple things to be a human being. All these people have preached it. It's not that I am preaching it for the first time.

00:24:52.600 --> 00:25:21.078
For the first time, Mohammed Sahib, he taught not to drink. But in the Islamic, I don't know what's wrong with them, but if you go to these Islamic countries, they drink like fish. They have made poetry on drinking. There is Umar Khayyam singing about drinking. You just cannot imagine.

00:25:21.148 --> 00:25:48.600
Christ has said that don't go near the spirits. Don't worry about the past, about the dead. Don't use spirits for showing off your chamatkara. Don't use spirits. But in the West, if you go you will be amazed. In London where I live, I have seen every third corner you find the negative man being implanted something and whatever were remaining we exported from here.

00:25:48.600 --> 00:26:17.600
You are very good at exporting the greatest crooks of the world. It's a shameful thing but we have done it. And I say [responsible/unclear]. They have cheated them, looted them and they say they know about God. They are going to give experiences. This is what it is. This is what Ghor Kali Yuga, where the rakshas are,

00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:42.600
have taken birth today and they are claiming and they are saying that we are the people in charge of religion. What religious thing they have done so far? How many people have got realization from them? Only you go and see their powers, they have to give you powers. You are to be empowered, your powers yourself must be manifested.

00:26:42.600 --> 00:27:05.600
That is what it is written in all the scriptures, Gita, Bible, Quran. There is nowhere written all these things that they will be doing. Your own powers through the vibrations of Chaitanya is not described only by Shankaracharya.

00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:36.193
Everywhere if you really go and search it out this is being described. But people don't want reality perhaps. They don't want the truth. They want some spectacular things. Is it? Is it that you think that now in Kali Yuga you can have a guru somewhere posted there and in charge of all your sins and everything.

00:27:36.263 --> 00:27:47.600
He is looking after you there and you do whatever you please. It is a very common thing I am surprised. See I went to Singapore and there were some people who came to see me and they said,

00:27:47.600 --> 00:28:11.600
Mataji we are in a very great mess. You must take us out of it. I said what happened? In Jakarta we lost all our money because we were smuggling things and all the money smuggled, whatever these textiles smuggled are taken away by the government there.

00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:41.507
I said now what can I do about your smuggling habits? I don't understand. But what about your guru? He said our guru never said anything to us. Whatever we did we had smuggling, we were having drinking, we were having 10 wives here, 10 wives there, 15 women there. He never said to us. Only thing he said is you give us the purse that's all. You give us the [unclear]. You do whatever you please. You come and touch my feet.

00:28:41.600 --> 00:29:10.600
Thousands of people were away. They will all go. The guru will be sitting on 7 feet high and these will be going just to touch his feet or drugged falling and leaking that dust. Because what is the guru doing? He is allowing you to do whatever you like. He is not giving you realization. He is not interested in anything like that. But he is only interested in your purse. Even if they were interested only in purse I said all right forget them. You see there are another cheats and smugglers that thank God now.

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:40.825
Nowadays with emergency they are being fought. But this kind of people they are all right forget them. But it's not so. If it were only that much I would have been very much satisfied all right forget them. These fools are being befooled. It's all right. But it's not only that. But they spoil your Kundalini. They have spoiled the Kundalini of thousands of people and the chances of your realization are very zero. I must say absolutely nil with so many people.

00:29:40.855 --> 00:30:03.600
Absolutely nil. The reason is this forehead of man, Mata, has been created in so many yoni's and so many lives it has passed through to create this human Mata.

00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:32.600
It's a very great thing that a human being has here. It is not to be put to a man who is even lesser than you as far as the humanity is concerned. He lives on your arms. Will you accept a single pie from me if I say all right I'll give you you please have your food. Will you take this beggars position? Will you live on others' people's food?

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:59.600
Will you live on others' people's money? You have bowed to falsehood. And this is what is not easily forgiven. I'm sorry but you just can't do it. It is like as if in the Kundalini there's a very big wound which is being created. Is a fact I'm telling you. I've seen thousands and thousands of people.

00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:23.600
It's the fact that this thing if it is has bowed to wrong type of people somehow God doesn't work. One has to work very hard but with some people the Kundalini rises just like this. The other time we had a big program downstairs if you remember.

00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:52.600
We had Justice White speaking to you and he told you about his realization how he got it. He said that I was just sitting in front of Mataji and two balls of ice as if came on to my hand and they started melting into me. And the peace and the bliss started flowing into my being. And since that day I always have that flow into me and the vibrations are flowing.

00:31:52.600 --> 00:32:18.560
It happened. He never lost it. He was there. He's a beautiful personality. Because not he's a justice or anything. Such a person can exist anywhere. God recognizes them and He grants them. To the small children it works just like this. They are innocent people.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:44.507
We have some physical problems we have. We have some mental problems. We have some emotional problems. Alright. The Kundalini rises. She first of all nourishes the beings within us. For example She gives physical comfort and that's how we have been able to cure cancer. We have definitely cured cancer.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:33:06.516
This I claim today and always I'll claim that we have got somebody here who has been fully cured. [unclear] But we have cured. So we are not interested. Because first we have to make some doctors of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:30.053
Let us prepare some people to be the doctors of Sahaja Yoga. Because once you say I cure cancer they'll say go to the cancer hospital and cure. Why should I? God can always cure them by giving them second birth.

00:33:30.083 --> 00:33:50.749
First of all let us have some doctors of Sahaja Yoga. So ask me for the real not for only physical. There are so many like that. At the time of Christ also same problem. All His disciples started bringing all the sick people and he got so fed up of them. That's just a byproduct.

00:33:50.809 --> 00:34:07.847
Emotionally perhaps you have come for the first time but people have seen many mad people we have cured emotionally. Tomorrow we are going to have a program for curatives also in the morning time.

00:34:07.877 --> 00:34:22.600
We have cured mentally upset people, disturbed people and very very sick people who were violent. But that's not our job. It's a byproduct.

00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:50.600
We have just to say that if you are seeking the truth, if you are really genuinely want to become one with that universal power of God.

00:34:50.600 --> 00:35:11.600
Then please ask for that first of all. Get that. Become a Sakshi, become a witness which Krishna has preached. That becomes the witness. I am here as your mother. Very great difference it is.

00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:28.600
You see mother will scold you. She will be angry sometimes. But you know in your heart of hearts that she loves you very much. And she has tremendous patience for you.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:47.600
And she thinks of only your Kalyana and of your Moksha. For Sahaja Yoga has to be at this time because Satya Yuga is already dawned. What is Satya Yuga?

00:35:47.600 --> 00:36:09.600
In the Satya Yuga people start feeling God's divine love. They enter into the kingdom of God. How do you say that they have entered into the kingdom of God? Because their awareness has changed into love awareness. In which they collectively can feel another personality.

00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:33.600
When the Kundalini rises, when you become realized, for example this gentleman is sitting before me. I can feel what's wrong with him. Where is the problem. Even a child can feel. If he is a realized soul, now my grandchild, you won't believe. She is hardly, I would say, hardly born because she is not even one year old.

00:36:33.600 --> 00:37:04.272
But as soon as somebody comes to the problem, immediately she takes out the finger which is burning and people know that this is the thing and that is the thing. Supposing this finger is burning on the right hand side, if you ask that person, have you got stomach trouble, he will say yes I have. Everybody will say this is the finger and this finger denotes on the right hand side is the solar plexus, the trouble in the solar plexus. With little practice and you understand also where it is exact, then you know where it is on the liver.

00:37:04.322 --> 00:37:33.481
Or which part? If this finger is catching then you know in a woman if it is, it's a uterus. Now what do you do in a Sahaja Yoga? Now see here the question of God comes in. Now you see this is catching, what do you do? You immediately know the uterus is something wrong, you ask the person is it wrong? Yes, you put your hand on the uterus.

00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:56.492
You give these vibrations. These vibrations are the synthesis of all the powers, the creative power, the existence power and evolutionary power. All these three powers combined together are in this.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:14.600
So when they go to that part which is diseased, it gets cured and the burning from the hand passes out. Immediately you feel alright, there is nothing wrong with the person, the person is alright, he is cured. Then people say how can it be? It is.

00:38:14.600 --> 00:38:38.600
Now how do you know there is God? When you have vibrations, you put your hands and ask the question is there God? Immediately a flow of vibrations starts, answer comes. You put the question, just say what's wrong with this gentleman?

00:38:38.600 --> 00:39:04.954
Immediately your fingers denote, these fingers I am here to decode them. These fingers denote different centers in your body. If you study them a little bit, you will know that this is the matter with this person. Now with little bit like this even you can cure that person. With the vibrations if you put around the aura of the person like a paraboli, you can give protection to that person.

00:39:05.054 --> 00:39:23.600
All absolute questions can be answered if you are a realized soul, otherwise you cannot answer. But the basic problem was so far that all such realized souls were born at that height and the whole world was at that height. When Kabita said,

00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:38.600
ida pingala nadi, he said sukhamana nadi, he said the śūnya śikhara pe anahata bole, people said what is this man? What is he talking? He is a mad man. This is some other language. But if you see all the Sahaja Yogis they talk like this now.

00:39:38.590 --> 00:40:03.529
Inka āgya pakḍā hai, inka pālanā pakḍā hai, yeh huā hai, woh huā hai. You will say what are they talking? Why they are turning their hands like this? Because the vibrations are flowing and they are using maneuvering their power. So, Kabira when he said anything, Nanak said anything, nobody understood what he was talking about.

00:40:03.600 --> 00:40:16.600
Time has come for you to rise to a certain height to understand that beyond this there is awareness in which you start feeling Him. That is how you enter into the kingdom of God.

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:34.600
Where complete integration of your being takes place, first thing, you get collectively conscious. You get collectively conscious. Now I don't know how to put it in words that you understand the meaning. You become collectively conscious. You are not so far.

00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:50.600
For example you can say yes, yes, I know he is a nice man. How do you say? Oh yes, I know he is alright. How do you know? Supposing you go to a doctor, he said alright I'll have to do some pathological test, I'll have to do this test and then I'll find out I'll take a test.

00:40:50.600 --> 00:41:15.457
But a Sahaja yogi can immediately say that this is the chakra which is caught and this is [unclear]. Your own power of yourself which exists in your heart is first time. Now this is very important. The cell which is manifesting its power without your consciousness comes into your consciousness.

00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:34.600
The vibrations are nothing but the manifestation of your self which is [unclear/God]. And self is the reflection of God. Now the whole complicated engineering I've tried to make it simpler though whatever you may try it doesn't become simpler.

00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:53.600
Because engineering of this day, fan which is given as comfort, oh God what a headache it is to explain. But to have the comfort is better. Better to have it. Then we'll talk about the engineering. Complete I'll teach you. Everything.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:24.211
Gopta, gopta taram, gopta tamam. The last word on all the secrets I'm going to tell you. Nothing is going to be kept up. But first of all you get your realization. Be nice children. As I always say I've done the cooking for you. So if you are hungry just have it. But do not have academic interest. Academic interest will create all these books. Good for nothing.

00:42:24.251 --> 00:42:46.736
Padhi, padhi, pandit murakh bhai. No, no, no, no. If you have read too much also it's a problem for Kundalini. You know you have conception of God also. You have conception of everything. Let it happen to you. Once it happens to you then you see for yourself if it is so or not.

00:42:46.786 --> 00:43:15.880
Now the time has come. The blossom time has come. Many are going to get it. But many won't be coming to Sahaja Yoga I can tell you. No they won't. Because I am a grahastha. They want a babaji, a lady like a babaji sitting here. She says you starve yourself for ten days. Then you give all your money to me. Of course that is first. Second time you starve yourself. Give your money to me.

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:32.357
I am a babaji I have given up my house but I am taking your money. I have given up my husband. All humbug. You are not to give up anything or to take anything. It's all myth. You have to be yourself.

00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:41.600
This is what Krishna tried to explain to Arjuna but he didn't understand it. At least you people understand it. Wherever you are you have to become yourself that's all.

00:43:41.600 --> 00:44:03.600
You are not to give up anything or to take anything or to do anything absurd. I am just like you because otherwise you would not listen to me. I am a housewife. You know I have a husband, I have children, I have grandchildren. So called because you are my children too.

00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:26.600
And this is the thing meant for ordinary normal married people or people who are householders. Not for these Tanyasi Babas. No. All this tomfoolery is not here needed. You are the greatest people.

00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:42.600
Because you have children, you have parents, you know how to balance life, you are very balanced people. And it is going to act only in you and not in these extremists. In India they call Bhagoras who has run away from the societies.

00:44:42.600 --> 00:45:09.529
There are some big big things you see. They are claiming I am this, I am that about you. I say what about you? Why don't you come down? Sitting in the Himalayas, sitting somewhere in the south, pondentially from there there is the right to be. Mother we know you have come and another one sitting down there in Gaganbaura. He says same, there another one sitting there. All claiming about me telling everybody who goes to them. Why don't you come down?

00:45:09.559 --> 00:45:26.600
They say oh we don't want to face them. They are not going to crucify you. They haven't got that kind of patience. Oh they will take a chimta and hit you hard. Char chimte deya tam.

00:45:26.600 --> 00:45:51.218
He tells me also, they tell me also. It's a mother's job. It's just a mother's job and that's why it has to be a mother. As Indians you are very lucky to have good mothers. And that's what a mother is.

00:45:51.600 --> 00:46:19.600
That she has to help you to get your realization. It is like one light which is enlightened the deeper has to enlighten other deeper. And then the another one that is enlightened has to enlighten another deeper. Let such Diwali be celebrated. It is your own power. It is your own thing. It is your own bati. It is your own oil. Only thing is the my light touches your light, you are enlightened.

00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:37.275
And then you enlighten another. And this light also corrects the physical, the emotional and the mental being within you. All the conflicts are resolved and you become that. A detached soul.

00:46:37.315 --> 00:46:58.600
Today has been an introductory lecture I should say. I hope you have understood it. It's an invitation. You don't have to do anything. You don't have to worry. There are some people who are writing articles after articles about all these horrid people.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:24.103
And they said we don't want to see Mataji because we are afraid of her. You are afraid of your mother. For a mother nobody is a sinner. Is there any sin which is greater than my love? I don't think. So please don't condemn yourself also. Just with open mind come and it will work out. It has worked with many, it is going to work out with you.

00:47:24.183 --> 00:47:46.600
We'll have some meditation for a while. We'll see how much it works out. There is nothing to be frightened of. It's a wonderful experience and but the only thing is after getting it you must understand the mechanism behind it. Supposing today you don't get it, don't get worried. Maybe some physical problem is there. Maybe some emotional problem is there. Maybe something. We'll work it out. So far except for one person.

00:47:46.600 --> 00:48:15.600
It has been coming to me for last six years I have not been able to give him realization. Though he is a very learned man. I'm sorry but it is the only man exceptional I can tell you that I have not been able to give him realization or he has not achieved it. But he is the only exceptional case otherwise everybody gets it. Only thing is that you have to stabilize it. The stabilization takes a little time and that is what is important.

00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:32.600
It stabilizes if you little bit practice the way of Sahaja Yoga. Faith is not needed but also denial is not needed. So you just sit with an open mind. Just with an open mind and it will work out.

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:46.600
Now you should not worry what the Sahaja Yogis are going to do about you. They might touch your head because here it breaks out you know that. They may touch some of your chakras, may touch, may not touch. They might give bandhan to that. They will work it out.

00:48:46.600 --> 00:49:17.315
It's something like this those who do not know how to swim are getting drowned. So those who know how to swim help the person to swim out. But the people who do not know how to swim have to keep quiet because they don't know. But once they learn it they can teach others. It is like this. It is going to work out that way and I hope all of you will have some experience tonight because I find the rate of realization is very fast. 

00:49:17.385 --> 00:49:27.455
In the beginning for two years I have worked very hard and only twelve people got realization and here I now find that just like this it happens.

00:49:27.600 --> 00:49:32.600
While coming from Delhi I met somebody from Madras and he just came and touched my feet and he said,

00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:38.930
Mataji I am so lucky I am on this plane. I was going by another plane. Can you give me your blessings? I said alright come along sit with me.

00:49:38.990 --> 00:49:57.550
And he got his realization within five minutes. Five minutes. It can happen. If there are any questions you better ask me because later on I don't want your buddhi to trouble you. This is it. But don't ask foolish questions. You see this is the real thing. If you are genuinely interested you have it.

00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:05.568
Don't waste the time of others because there can be some negative people also just trying to waste our time. So don't waste it. If there is a sensible question just ask me.

00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:16.458
Because later on I don't want you people to feel that oh I didn't ask this question I should have asked this question. There is no need to ask questions. The children don't ask any question. They get it.

00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:23.376
But you should want. If there is any problem please ask. Any problem that you have.
