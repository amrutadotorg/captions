1
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:14,700
I am immensely joyous to see you all here.

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:26,360
I do not know what to say from my side.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:31,660
The words get lost, they have no meaning.

4
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:47,670
So many of you are aspiring to ascend to that
state where you would have complete joy, bliss

5
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,079
and peace.

6
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,560
This is what I could give you.

7
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:04,000
And a mother is only happy when she can give
whatever she has to her children.

8
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:19,140
Her unhappiness, all her restlessness, everything
is just to achieve that end – to gift all

9
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,810
that she has.

10
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:35,010
I don’t know how much to thank you people
to go through all this to get to that treasure

11
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:41,290
that you have within yourself.

12
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:57,100
‘Sahaj’ is the only word I could think
[of] when I started to manifest Sahastrara

13
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,590
opening.

14
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:07,009
That’s easily understood by everyone so
far.

15
00:02:07,009 --> 00:02:16,610
But you have realised that it is today a different
style of yoga where first enlightenment is

16
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:21,209
given and then you are allowed to look after
yourself.

17
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:24,129
It was never done before.

18
00:02:24,129 --> 00:03:02,230
It’s just a venture of your Mother which
has worked out.

19
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:23,079
Otherwise, in the olden times the concern
of Divine was to get people enlightened and

20
00:03:23,079 --> 00:03:28,269
It did not know how to work it out.

21
00:03:28,269 --> 00:03:36,200
No incarnation ever tried to work it out in
this fashion.

22
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:50,319
But whenever they tried, they tried to have
a very severe hardship for the seekers – very

23
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,909
severe hardships.

24
00:03:51,909 --> 00:04:00,730
I wonder how many of you have read the treatise
of Buddha, when he used to travel with thousand

25
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:03,919
of his disciples – not giving Realisation.

26
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:15,099
They were not Realised-souls, without feeling
any joy around; with two clothes, living in

27
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:16,530
the jungles.

28
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:20,700
Just two clothes!

29
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:26,920
And the area where he visited, which I have
seen myself, is terribly cold, chilly, absolutely

30
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,920
chilly.

31
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:35,490
And the clothes were not clothes actually,
it was cloth covering their body.

32
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:47,740
Sleeping on the open ground in very severe
winter or maybe in summer.

33
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,120
Without any shoes they were asked to walk,
for miles together, miles together!

34
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,810
If you go and see where Buddha has walked
and trodden, you will be surprised!

35
00:04:57,810 --> 00:05:02,720
Buddha was also young – he used to walk.

36
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:08,360
But his disciples used to walk much more because
he would go and station at one place.

37
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,930
He would send his disciples.

38
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,780
There was no time to advertise or to announce
anything.

39
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,690
So he used to stay in one place, and the disciples
used to go around the villages, ask for bhiksha

40
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:32,370
– meaning the ‘alms’ – to gather some
food from the villages; cook one time, give

41
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,310
part of it to Buddha.

42
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:42,540
And rest of that they used to eat.

43
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:47,570
They would go, work out, get people from all
the villages, whatever was possible and would

44
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:51,420
bring them to Buddha for sermon.

45
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,190
Such sacrifices!

46
00:05:53,190 --> 00:06:02,060
They have lived in huts, caves, in terrible
darkness, meditating.

47
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,490
But they never got Realisation.

48
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,930
Very few got their Realisation.

49
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:23,360
They were people who were sons of great kings,
and princes, dukes, duchesses – all very,

50
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,330
very rich people.

51
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:35,500
Woman of very rich families followed him.

52
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:46,640
And they walked for miles together with him
in the thorny routes; because they felt that

53
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:57,360
Buddha’s work was of such universal importance,
that they are the part and parcel of such

54
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:08,400
a tremendous task; that they should be taking
part in such a great work for humanity.

55
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:19,130
This is not only in India, but even Viditama
who started the Zen system in Japan.

56
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:24,900
In China, I was surprised, the amount of sacrifices
the saints had made, the way they lived!

57
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:29,560
I mean if you see the way they were living
– in the conditions – you cannot imagine!

58
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:38,240
And they ended up their lives like that, working
it out.

59
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,580
Without any proper guidance because Buddha
had died – there was no way out.

60
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:44,720
They had to find their own ways.

61
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,710
Then they found mahayan and shvetayan – all
kind of things.

62
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:57,230
Even if you see other seekers in other religions
– like at the time of Christ – where did

63
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,220
they live?

64
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,650
And after the death of Christ it was even
worse because they were persecuted, they were

65
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,280
killed, they were tortured, crucified!

66
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:20,170
It happened with Moses also – his disciples
were hounded so they had to all run towards

67
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,170
India.

68
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,690
Imagine the distances!

69
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:32,289
From that area to Kashmir – how they must
have walked, how they must have lived, how

70
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:34,959
they must have carried.

71
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:40,159
And in thousands, in thousands they came,
to India.

72
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:47,690
Because they realised that they are doing
a tremendous task.

73
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,160
Something so great that they are supporting.

74
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,899
In this country we had a struggle of freedom.

75
00:08:56,899 --> 00:08:58,579
I was part and parcel of that.

76
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:01,139
My parents were part and parcel of that.

77
00:09:01,139 --> 00:09:05,699
They were rich people, quite rich I should
say, from every standard.

78
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:10,339
You will be amazed – my father burnt all
his suits.

79
00:09:10,339 --> 00:09:13,470
They were stitched in England.

80
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:16,620
My mother burnt all her saris.

81
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:24,089
They used to spin their own clothes and wear
them.

82
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:31,839
My father sacrificed everything, every pie
that he had, for the freedom struggle (1 pie

83
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:32,839
= rupee 1/192).

84
00:09:32,839 --> 00:09:36,690
He left nothing for us, not a single [pie].

85
00:09:36,690 --> 00:09:42,069
Of course, our family being rich we had silver
and gold and all that but as far as all the

86
00:09:42,069 --> 00:09:46,620
cash money was concerned – was spent.

87
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:51,459
And all this silver and gold also, thanks
to English, that they took away from us and

88
00:09:51,459 --> 00:09:54,010
they returned us when they went back.

89
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:58,709
That’s how we had some silver and gold left
in the family.

90
00:09:58,709 --> 00:10:01,879
Every thing, all that is material, was snatched
away.

91
00:10:01,879 --> 00:10:02,879
And I know.

92
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:07,750
We lived in beautiful houses and then we shifted
to huts and lived there.

93
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,750
Sacrifices to the maximum.

94
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:13,119
And we were very happy about it, very proud!

95
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,560
We had only two changes (of clothes).

96
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,720
We used to wash our clothes.

97
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:25,119
We lived like very poor people; sleeping on
this kind of thing (thin, rough floor mats).

98
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:37,611
For my life, I remember that I never used
to take a pillow; I never used chappals (sandals)

99
00:10:37,611 --> 00:10:38,611
for ages.

100
00:10:38,611 --> 00:10:43,180
I had only one sweater made of this kind of
a material.

101
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:49,699
Till I passed out and went to medical college,
I had that sweater with me.

102
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:55,719
I had only one coat, throughout my education
when I was in Lahore which was terribly cold

103
00:10:55,719 --> 00:11:02,949
– sometimes can be like London – which
was worn out and finished.

104
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:08,160
But we never grudged and never grumbled and
never said that our father should have looked

105
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,579
after us and done something, “Why did he
just sacrifice everything for the country?”

106
00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:14,579
Never!

107
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:15,579
Never!

108
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:16,579
Never!

109
00:11:16,579 --> 00:11:25,500
But even today, when they see us anywhere,
they know we are the children of such a great

110
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,500
man.

111
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,519
They have tremendous respect for us.

112
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,930
That quality was created, I should say by
Mahatma Gandhi.

113
00:11:34,930 --> 00:11:44,050
He made everybody so transformed into a new
personality of tremendous sacrifice!

114
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,060
Tremendous!

115
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,139
You cannot imagine how people lived!

116
00:11:49,139 --> 00:11:57,769
All the money we had, everything that we had,
all conveniences and conveyances, all housing,

117
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:03,660
everything, was given up – not only by my
father but so many of them.

118
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:10,749
Otherwise we could have not got our freedom.

119
00:12:10,749 --> 00:12:16,679
To get our freedom this country has sacrificed
so much.

120
00:12:16,679 --> 00:12:30,110
Now, after that, we are here to get our freedom,
to get the freedom for our Spirit.

121
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:39,509
To make our Spirit free from our greed, lust;
from your anger, from our conditionings, from

122
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:53,980
our terrible ego, from the body being enslaved
by comforts.

123
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,700
I must say Gandhiji had a special charm.

124
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:00,819
I don’t know how he managed.

125
00:13:00,819 --> 00:13:07,440
He was like Touch of Midas – he touched
anybody and he became transformed.

126
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:17,649
And he was an extremely strict man – very
kind to me, to children – but he was an

127
00:13:17,649 --> 00:13:19,220
extremely strict man.

128
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:22,220
He would not tolerate any nonsense at all!

129
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:32,939
Throughout, if you study in the way all these
people were brought up, not only for freedom

130
00:13:32,939 --> 00:13:41,629
of independence, but even before that, for
Spiritual life, anywhere, there’s one thing

131
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:45,970
very common – is sacrifice.

132
00:13:45,970 --> 00:13:53,079
And the consciousness that you are doing something
great, consciousness that you are part and

133
00:13:53,079 --> 00:14:02,839
parcel of the whole, such a big thing, such
a big work, such a noble cause!!

134
00:14:02,839 --> 00:14:21,689
And then there was one thing very common among
all of them: that the noble cause, the upliftment

135
00:14:21,689 --> 00:14:30,180
(sic) of the noble cause, made them sacrifice
in such a sahaj manner.

136
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,279
Much more than the Sahaj Yogis sometimes,
who have got so much in Sahaj Yoga.

137
00:14:34,279 --> 00:14:37,009
They have got their joy, they have got their
Spirit.

138
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:43,470
But I have seen with my own eyes, such people
in this country; whom you may call legendary

139
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:46,319
but I have seen it.

140
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:50,699
Thousands of people were killed and butchered,
children died.

141
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,329
Nobody shed tears.

142
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:56,120
Nobody shed tears.

143
00:14:56,120 --> 00:15:13,709
But to feel that you are for such a noble
cause itself gives you that joy and that sense

144
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,470
of involvement!

145
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:24,819
And moreover, what I know about Mahatma Gandhi
and other people, what I have seen, how they

146
00:15:24,819 --> 00:15:30,139
were – everybody was not allowed to come
in.

147
00:15:30,139 --> 00:15:38,139
And anybody who did slightest thing less,
whether he was king’s son or he was anybody’s

148
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:47,420
daughter or anything, any little thing they
spoilt, anything – he was chucked out.

149
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:53,499
I have stayed in Gandhi’s ashram, so I know
what it is, and that’s why you know I can

150
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,149
go through rigorous life.

151
00:15:55,149 --> 00:15:56,799
It is his training.

152
00:15:56,799 --> 00:16:03,459
All the children above twelve years had to
clean the whole of that ashram area – which

153
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:06,910
is in fifty acres of land – every morning.

154
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:12,489
They had to clean their latrines.

155
00:16:12,489 --> 00:16:16,170
Also the latrines of the guests.

156
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:21,259
I have cleaned!

157
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:25,990
And they were allowed only two dresses.

158
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:30,800
And nothing could be kept, even you cannot
see one paper anywhere, any litter anywhere

159
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,589
– so clean, spick and span.

160
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:41,799
And the living places were so neat and tidy.

161
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:47,449
It was all done with cow dung, completely
with cow dung.

162
00:16:47,449 --> 00:16:55,160
Everybody had to take a bath, early in the
morning at 4 o’ clock, with cold water.

163
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:03,920
Whether it was Jawaharlal Nehru or Abdul Kalam
Azad, my father, of any age group, or a child.

164
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:09,420
And 5 o’clock, mahatma Gandhi was there
for his lecture.

165
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:12,990
Please don’t raise your hands or raise your
Kundalinis!

166
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,070
Please be seated!

167
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,500
That’s not the way!

168
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,870
Try to understand what I am talking!

169
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:31,800
And then, early in the morning at 4 o’clock,
you will be surprised, getting up.

170
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,120
For me it was alright!

171
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:45,260
And then to walk in that fifty acres of land
to centre of that hall, which was nothing

172
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:50,890
but just an open space surrounded by some
sort of huts where Gandhiji was living.

173
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,040
To walk all the way after bath, after getting
ready and all that.

174
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,550
And snakes used to crawl along.

175
00:17:58,550 --> 00:18:00,010
Nobody was bitten, of course.

176
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:09,290
I think the snakes understood that people
were busy with the great job of freeing this

177
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:11,520
great country!

178
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:19,070
And we would sit just like this and the snakes
would be crawling.

179
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:20,620
No lights were allowed.

180
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:23,800
No lights of any kind.

181
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:30,100
We only used sunlight.

182
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:35,060
And when Gandhiji would come – I mean sunlight
was not there in the morning, at all – some

183
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:39,730
lanterns were brought to put there.

184
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:43,030
And we would see the snakes crawling up.

185
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:46,830
But I never heard anybody complaining.

186
00:18:46,830 --> 00:18:57,760
But like a war, drove with such passion, everybody,
competing as to, “What I can do?

187
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:01,460
How I can be alright?”

188
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:07,080
Nobody even thought of comfort!

189
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:20,500
Of course they were all up to 50 years of
age or something like that, maybe.

190
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:27,110
In the ashram mostly people were up to fifty
years of age – at that time.

191
00:19:27,110 --> 00:19:38,430
And I have seen by my own eyes the people
who had huge cars in the house and things

192
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:43,430
like that, they sold [them] off, they threw
it away.

193
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,660
They used to come by train to Wardha station
and walk down.

194
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:50,380
Gandhiji would not see anybody coming even
in tonga (horse-cart).

195
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:57,610
And they listened to him and obeyed him.

196
00:19:57,610 --> 00:20:03,510
I have seen many missionaries, though they
are not up to point, nothing very noble, but

197
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:07,700
that’s how they take people to task and
people work it out for them.

198
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,700
I have seen them.

199
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:18,520
In India we had missionaries, and younger
people who came from abroad, they just absolutely

200
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:27,150
obediently listened to the missionaries and
did whatever they said.

201
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:35,080
Now today we are doing, as you know, the greatest
of greatest work!

202
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:41,140
Because freedom is of course necessary, political
freedom, to talk about the God.

203
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,890
We could not even make a small, little needle!

204
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,150
At that time we were not allowed by government.

205
00:20:47,150 --> 00:20:48,150
So much oppressed.

206
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:53,110
So we had to get out of the shackles of slavery.

207
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,160
No doubt.

208
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:08,970
But now I find we have another kind of slavery
– a slavery of selfishness, self oriented.

209
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:11,240
“This is my comfort.

210
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:17,180
I must have this, it should be enjoyable,
I am enjoying, I am this, I am that."

211
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:19,280
You should enjoy otherwise it is not something
great.

212
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:28,850
I mean the whole thing should provide you
some sort of a feeling instead of you providing

213
00:21:28,850 --> 00:21:30,240
the feeling.

214
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:39,070
Because people, I think, do not know what
they are doing, what sort of a work they are

215
00:21:39,070 --> 00:21:40,070
doing.

216
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:45,262
They do not want to come to that level of
that height to see what are you up to.

217
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:51,370
You are trying to save the whole world!

218
00:21:51,370 --> 00:21:57,570
This is one of the reasons Sahaj Yoga moves
so slowly, because I see people who are worried

219
00:21:57,570 --> 00:22:02,870
about their comforts, this, that, and also
themselves are so lousy!

220
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:12,190
There’s no smartness about them, no feeling
of that greatness that they have to do.

221
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,190
You have to be smart.

222
00:22:13,190 --> 00:22:22,630
If you know you are on war – how you behave?

223
00:22:22,630 --> 00:22:27,640
I am sure the mediocrity is much less now,
better people.

224
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:32,010
I am sure we will get even better people now,
much better people!

225
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:37,340
They worry about little, little things: of
their family, this, that.

226
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:43,140
They worry about their own problems, and their
jobs, and this and that.

227
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:45,450
I mean nobody could talk like this to Gandhiji!

228
00:22:45,450 --> 00:22:49,420
I tell you, he would have slapped you!

229
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:52,870
Take it from me.

230
00:22:52,870 --> 00:22:59,070
It is as if to come to Sahaj Yoga means – solve
your problems – that’s all.

231
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:04,410
Though they are solved, no doubt, you are
helped, God helps you so much.

232
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:07,230
But how much are you doing about it?

233
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:18,710
Of course we have some very great Sahaj yogis,
I would not deny that fact, we have some – much

234
00:23:18,710 --> 00:23:23,190
more than I had, ever – and that’s why
I am very joyous about it.

235
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:30,660
But the dedication we have: we count every
penny that we spend, how much we have got

236
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,990
out of that penny, what did we do about it.

237
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:40,000
This is not 
the way!

238
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,961
Buddha never spent a single penny of his own.

239
00:23:41,961 --> 00:23:43,890
He got money from all his disciples.

240
00:23:43,890 --> 00:23:46,120
Built all these big things and all that.

241
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:53,440
He never had even a public help from anybody
else.

242
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,680
So rise now!

243
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:58,280
You must rise above your petty small mind.

244
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:05,740
Rise up to the point where you should know
[that] you are going to save the whole humanity.

245
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:12,450
If you cannot feel that, it’s better to
leave Sahaj Yoga.

246
00:24:12,450 --> 00:24:17,420
Sahaj Yoga is not meant for the people who
are lousy.

247
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,490
In Marathi the word is ‘gabale’.

248
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:29,500
Tukaram has said, “yerya gabalyache kaama
nohe” (meaning) “It is not the work of

249
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,440
the lousy!”

250
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:41,780
Shivaji himself, when he fought his war, he
caught hold of people, the sartaras and the

251
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:43,980
dukes of that time they were.

252
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,320
They gave up everything they had, they gave
up their lives, every thing!

253
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,631
Their children they sacrificed, they sacrificed
whatever they had!

254
00:24:53,631 --> 00:24:59,320
Shivaji had no money to pay them.

255
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:04,490
You must have heard lots of stories about
Shivaji.

256
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:11,180
While if you see how we Sahaj yogis are in
this world: kshema (well-being) comes before

257
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,180
yoga.

258
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,050
Its like that.

259
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:16,880
Its your mother’s love.

260
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,660
I want my children to be comfortable.

261
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,660
They are newly born babes.

262
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:29,020
Alright, they need comfort, they are to be
looked after.

263
00:25:29,020 --> 00:25:39,120
But I cannot blackmail the Divine because
the children are small can I!

264
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:45,370
I am here to do the job of God Almighty.

265
00:25:45,370 --> 00:25:54,900
And when you are my children his grace will
work, He’ll look after you, He’ll make

266
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:56,110
you grow.

267
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,920
But grow now!

268
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:58,920
Grow!

269
00:25:58,920 --> 00:25:59,920
You have to grow!

270
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:03,860
Get out of this small nonsense that you are!

271
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:07,040
See your personality – how do you live?

272
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:09,700
Where is your attention?

273
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,090
What do you think?

274
00:26:11,090 --> 00:26:16,520
Are you thinking about Sahaj Yoga, that it
is the most important thing for which you

275
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:20,360
are chosen?

276
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:33,740
I feel sometimes, as I was feeling all the
time, that you might be uncomfortable in many

277
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,740
places.

278
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:39,900
But I myself have seen the way you people
have been in those places, most carelessly

279
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:43,440
– the Western Sahaj yogis, I was surprised.

280
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,690
That way Indians are better in this respect.

281
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:52,450
And some of the Indian Sahaj yogis have been
misbehaving in a very funny manner.

282
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,450
It shocked me!

283
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:59,140
The way they have been behaving, shouting
at people, creating problems.

284
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:04,520
Some people come to see me, they talk to them
in such a rude manner that they run away.

285
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:07,140
You can talk to them sweetly.

286
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,990
You have to be nice to them; not to shout
at people.

287
00:27:09,990 --> 00:27:14,930
Alright, I cannot meet everyone at every time,
at every convenience, but that does not mean

288
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:19,990
that you have right to shout at others.

289
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:29,510
This is so petty and so low that I don’t
know how far I have to come down!

290
00:27:29,510 --> 00:27:39,500
When you rise above all these petty things,
you will develop that Divine discretion.

291
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,240
That Divine discretion is the real blessing
of God.

292
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:49,090
All other blessings, that you think is a blessing,
is no blessing at all!

293
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,440
Unless and until you can grow, what is the
blessing?

294
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,920
Like a tree which says, “Oh, such a blessing
that I have got rain!”

295
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:04,300
But out of that rain if you cannot grow, what’s
the use of having that rain on you?

296
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:19,310
You have to be compassionate, beautiful, sensible
people, who are the highest beings on this

297
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:20,310
earth.

298
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:27,130
Take out your attention from all nonsense
that you have been busy with.

299
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:34,280
That’s how you get possessed, that’s how
you get conditioned.

300
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:38,510
Small, small things you see.

301
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:43,690
In India we have another problem: We cannot
tolerate another person.

302
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:47,940
If any person is doing good for Sahaj Yoga,
immediately a group is built up (against them)

303
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,450
– it’s very common with Indians also.

304
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:55,670
A group is built up to put him down.

305
00:28:55,670 --> 00:29:01,080
This was not done when Gandhiji was there.

306
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,270
I do not know how it happens.

307
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,470
It only happens with poor leadership.

308
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,530
I think I don’t have that leadership!

309
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:15,430
At the time of Gandhiji he used to blast people
out completely!

310
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:23,620
Cutting each other’s throats and saying
things behind the back, forming groups.

311
00:29:23,620 --> 00:29:28,830
Anybody who works out something nice, and
I try to help that person to express himself,

312
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:35,760
immediately a group comes up to press him.

313
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,910
And there are some hopelessly peripheral,
useless Sahaj Yogis in the West and in the

314
00:29:39,910 --> 00:29:45,090
East, who try to make a mess of things.

315
00:29:45,090 --> 00:29:48,900
They think, they are big gurus, big people!

316
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,500
Very small people.

317
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:53,080
Chicken hearted, I should say.

318
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:58,920
And they think they are very big, great people,
because they can take good photographs, maybe,

319
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,180
or that they can wear a dress in a particular
manner, or something like that – stupid

320
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,620
stuff as they are!

321
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:10,090
And trying to dominate others.

322
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,920
Such people will be thrown out, absolutely.

323
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:20,050
No use having useless people in a machine
like this.

324
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:29,730
Today is the beginning of a new era – of
a new era of people of very high qualities

325
00:30:29,730 --> 00:30:34,670
whose Spirit has been enlightened.

326
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:40,600
Let us all think about it!

327
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:48,930
Now you have to rule yourself, and you have
to rule others through compassion, love and

328
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:49,930
discretion!!

329
00:30:49,930 --> 00:30:56,490
Today that’s the big time that I have declared
that it is the Universal Religion, the Nirmala

330
00:30:56,490 --> 00:31:03,950
Religion which is formed out of my teachings
of love.

331
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:08,190
But it doesn’t mean by any chance that you
remain dwarfs!

332
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:14,390
I’m not going to spoil you!

333
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:20,740
I am not going to spoil you by keeping you
dwarfy people!

334
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:25,580
So try to rise!

335
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:27,420
Do not dominate others.

336
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:28,510
Respect!

337
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:31,330
Respect each other!

338
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:37,850
You are out for a very big work of Viraat.

339
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:45,680
How much you know about the Divine nobody
has known so far!

340
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:47,480
But fix up yourself.

341
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:56,200
I have known a very great saint called Gagangadh
Maharaj who has fallen down completely!

342
00:31:56,200 --> 00:32:01,270
If a person like him can fall down you also
can fall down if you do not understand what

343
00:32:01,270 --> 00:32:09,300
is your worth, what is your value and what
is your position you are given.

344
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:17,081
So we have to, today, with all our love for
our Mother, have to decide in our heart, that

345
00:32:17,081 --> 00:32:19,240
we are going to have large heartedness, of
sacrifices!

346
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:22,770
What have we sacrificed so far?

347
00:32:22,770 --> 00:32:24,250
Just think of it.

348
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:25,250
Have we?

349
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:36,700
Did we sacrifice anything?

350
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:48,940
Please try to understand that I have to use
you, the great souls, to save the humanity.

351
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:49,940
You must grow.

352
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:50,940
You must grow.

353
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:51,940
You have to grow.

354
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:56,970
On money points also people are wretched.

355
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,610
They make money.

356
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:02,710
They save money.

357
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:11,500
In America, I was surprised, the way people
cheated me of money!

358
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:12,740
Thousands!

359
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:20,230
In India also this is a very common practice!

360
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:30,160
Then if you have career mindedness, and you
are very ambitious, “How my job will remain?”

361
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:37,080
this, that – you better get out of Sahaj
Yoga!

362
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:44,440
It’s not going to help us at all!

363
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:50,770
Thirdly there are people who believe that,
“This is my wife, this is my beloved, this

364
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:52,340
is this,” and all that nonsense.

365
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,920
Why are you here?

366
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,410
For what?

367
00:33:55,410 --> 00:34:05,060
Or “My children, my household, my mother,
my father."

368
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:08,780
all sorts of wretched people around!

369
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:16,200
If you cannot rise above that, you cannot
help me, I am sorry.

370
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,700
You cannot help me.

371
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:24,210
You have to be very, very strong people.

372
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:34,310
You have to be people of very great valour
and great idealism and noble ideas.

373
00:34:34,310 --> 00:34:47,110
Some are like petty shopkeepers who follow
the platoons to sell some things around – in

374
00:34:47,110 --> 00:34:53,530
Marathi it is called ‘bazar bhunge’!

375
00:34:53,530 --> 00:35:08,430
So now you meditate on this point that here
we are to establish the Universal Religion

376
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:09,430
of ascent.

377
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:12,670
It is a tremendous task!

378
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:22,714
If I could do it alone I would have done it
but I cannot.

379
00:35:22,714 --> 00:35:26,530
It’s only through you I have to do it.

380
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:27,530
And you have a heritage.

381
00:35:27,530 --> 00:35:42,460
You come from a very great birth, where you
have this heritage.

382
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:51,950
With that heritage, if I cannot manage you,
I think I better give up your leadership.

383
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:55,210
I cannot do it!

384
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:05,610
When we were fighting for our freedom all
of us were removed from schools because we

385
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:11,530
were in the missionary school and the missionaries
believed that Christ was born in England!

386
00:36:11,530 --> 00:36:13,460
So they would not allow us to study in those
schools.

387
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,300
So we were all removed from those schools.

388
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,410
We had no education for some time.

389
00:36:17,410 --> 00:36:20,900
I couldn’t pass my inter-science for two
years.

390
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:27,280
I couldn’t appear because they rusticated
us from colleges and schools.

391
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:34,180
The government rusticated us.

392
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,640
But we were such proud children, very proud.

393
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,830
I was of course very much thick in it.

394
00:36:41,830 --> 00:36:42,830
I was never frightened.

395
00:36:42,830 --> 00:36:44,470
I was just an eighteen year old girl.

396
00:36:44,470 --> 00:36:53,690
And I remember one day some people came and
told us that your father is transferred from

397
00:36:53,690 --> 00:36:56,390
this jail to another jail.

398
00:36:56,390 --> 00:36:59,490
They had such pride for all of us, all the
people!

399
00:36:59,490 --> 00:37:01,470
So they had brought cars to take us down.

400
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:07,619
And they were so many there.

401
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:11,290
And [my] mother naturally was worried because
I was a young girl.

402
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:17,000
The police used to torture me, used to give
me [electric] shocks, and make my life very

403
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,110
miserable, beat me, and all that.

404
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:25,880
So she was crying and she told an old gentleman
who was there that, “I am worried about

405
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,880
my daughter.

406
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:31,869
I do not want her to be tortured anymore."

407
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:38,560
So I went and smiled at him, so he said, “No,
you stop it now!

408
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,610
You just don’t do it.

409
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,320
It’s not proper."

410
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,130
So my father took me aside, he said, “Don’t
listen to this ‘old johnny’!

411
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:51,100
He’s now about to die.

412
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:53,640
Forget him.

413
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:01,380
I would like all my children to be sacrificed
on the altar of freedom.

414
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:04,340
If you are doing it I am a proud father.

415
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,660
And I will tell your mother to behave herself.

416
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:16,780
I am so proud of you!”

417
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:20,122
Such atmosphere I have passed through.

418
00:38:20,122 --> 00:38:23,869
I had to give up my college.

419
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:26,530
I was absconding for eight months.

420
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:29,890
The police was after my life.

421
00:38:29,890 --> 00:38:31,220
I know what we have gone through.

422
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:34,190
We were very young people -eighteen years.

423
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,630
You can imagine!

424
00:38:36,630 --> 00:38:48,670
And now when you have got the freedom of your
Spirit you must seek the comfort of your Spirit.

425
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:52,890
There are some people who are complainers,
and this and that -nonsense.

426
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,420
They should not have come!

427
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,450
Or those who are Indians – they should get
out of Sahaj Yoga and leave us alone.

428
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:08,340
But, those who know that they have come here,
not to enjoy themselves only, but to make

429
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:13,180
the whole world enjoy what you have got, to
give it to them.

430
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:22,750
And for that one has to sacrifice, one has
to bear the pangs!

431
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:28,740
How much I bear your pangs when you are caught
up, when you have troubles, when this and

432
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:29,740
that.

433
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,130
I have got blisters sometimes, from you, everything.

434
00:39:31,130 --> 00:39:40,550
But I don’t mind because it is my life,
my mission, my existence, my everything- is

435
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:44,470
for the purpose of emancipation of humanity.

436
00:39:44,470 --> 00:39:48,960
Even the last drop of my blood is for that.

437
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:52,640
So my satisfactions are very different.

438
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:01,710
Please remember, you are born of a very brave
Mother.

439
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:04,030
Please, try to rise!

440
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:10,730
Be proud that you are doing such a tremendous
task.

441
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:19,060
Have that feeling of great valour.

442
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:24,990
Then only, then only, we can achieve results!

443
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:29,580
You have seen so many wars, you have seen
so many war pictures, you have seen how people

444
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:33,170
have fought, how they have sacrificed themselves.

445
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:44,800
And let us see what are we doing in this war!

446
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:48,470
Just make your body your slave.

447
00:40:48,470 --> 00:41:00,510
Get out of the slavery of your body, of your
conditionings, and your nonsensical ego.

448
00:41:00,510 --> 00:41:06,580
I am sure as a Mother I am not so bad.

449
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:14,270
But as a father I think I lack some things.

450
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:27,220
Please try to come up so that I should feel
that I did not lack in my fatherly attitude

451
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:36,540
towards you – that awe, that understanding
of a father’s expectations.

452
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:46,880
This I am not saying to you because it is
some present situation, because a few people

453
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,300
particularly, or for anything which is very,
very sort of [a] present day problem.

454
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:56,490
None of these things.

455
00:41:56,490 --> 00:42:07,200
But is my announcement of this new dimension
into which we have to rise.

456
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,609
And as in the war, we have to declare, “Now
forward on!”

457
00:42:12,609 --> 00:42:15,180
In the same way this is a declaration.

458
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:21,330
In no way to degrade you, in no way to insult
you, or to say anything about anyone of you.

459
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:31,320
But to just infuse that inspiration which
led thousands and thousands and millions and

460
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:38,730
billions of people to sacrifice for a greater
cause!

461
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:44,440
So now have respect for yourself.

462
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,440
Raise your heads!

463
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:49,950
You are the ones who are going to fight.

464
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:53,660
You are the ones who are responsible.

465
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:55,180
Prepare yourself!

466
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,350
Prepare your body.

467
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,460
Prepare your mind!

468
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,210
Be discreet!

469
00:43:04,210 --> 00:43:12,330
This is my, I would not say ‘request’
again.

470
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:14,470
This is my order!

471
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:20,300
May God bless you!

472
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:27,579
Let us all meditate now!

473
00:43:27,579 --> 00:43:30,870
There is no need for tying up your Kundalinis.

474
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:32,510
There is no need to give yourself bandhan.

475
00:43:32,510 --> 00:43:37,010
There is no need at all to do anything.

476
00:43:37,010 --> 00:43:39,760
If you come up to that stage just now.

477
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:43,000
There’s no need to raise your hands and
tying up your Kundalini – not necessary.

478
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,150
Nothing is to be done!

479
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:52,830
Your Kundalinis are already tied up.

480
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:53,890
Assume!

481
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:56,090
Assume that situation, that’s all!

482
00:43:56,090 --> 00:44:18,060
That’s what you are – the veeras and not
the stupid!

483
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,060
Respect yourself.

484
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,060
Respect!

485
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:21,310
May God bless you all.

486
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:30,510
There’s nothing, nothing more important
to me than to see you rise to that level of

487
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:34,550
understanding of your own values and worth
and discretion.

488
00:44:34,550 --> 00:44:47,390
You have to become sweet, nice people but
very, very powerful!

489
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:51,000
That you can control yourself, your tongues
and your things.

490
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:57,619
The control, complete control of your self.

491
00:44:57,619 --> 00:45:05,860
May God bless you again!

492
00:45:05,860 --> 00:45:07,940
Please meditate.

493
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,060
Close your eyes!

494
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:14,170
Close your eyes!

495
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:18,330
Just close your eyes.

496
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:25,600
Put your both the hands towards me.

497
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:29,590
Put your attention onto Sahastrara!

498
00:45:29,590 --> 00:45:31,160
Just your attention onto Sahastrara.

499
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:34,280
You are in my Sahastrara all of you just now.

500
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:36,600
Put your attention to your Sahastrara.

501
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,550
There’s no thought, nothing.

502
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:50,560
Just put your attention to your…and just
rise up to that point.

503
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,500
There’s no drama about it.

504
00:45:56,500 --> 00:46:00,060
There’s nothing artificial.

505
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,440
It’s actualisation.

506
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,320
All weaknesses are to be left behind.

507
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:38,600
Let’s be strong people of strong values
with dignity and sobriety.

508
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,920
Silence, absolute inner silence.

509
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,640
And one need not talk too much.

510
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:54,600
Too much to jabber, to talk, frivolously,
is not your way.

511
00:50:54,609 --> 00:51:25,330
Feel it in your heart, your own dignity, your
own glory, the serenity of behaviour.

512
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:46,400
You are all saints, but saints of very high
quality, of very high quality.

513
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,400
Not ordinary type.

514
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:37,600
Put your attention to Sahastrara.

515
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:40,420
Chitta aple Sahastrara tevaitze.

516
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:47,900
Apne Sahastrar pe apna Chitta tev. (Marathi: Put your attention to your Sahastrara)

517
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,080
Any thought coming say, “Not this, not this,
not this."

518
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,000
May God bless you.

519
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:40,480
I would like to see all the groups some time,
one by one, all the leaders and also certain

520
00:55:40,480 --> 00:55:45,660
individuals who want to see me.

521
00:55:45,660 --> 00:56:03,140
We are going to have marriages, and everything,
performed here and it’s going to work out

522
00:56:03,140 --> 00:56:04,000
very well.

523
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:07,860
But suddenly don’t jump onto the thing!

524
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:19,880
Do it in your sobriety, in understanding that,
this marriage is nothing but because you have

525
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:30,220
to have children of very high quality. Secondly it has to be auspicious.

526
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:36,740
Just to wash off if there was any inauspiciousness.

527
00:56:48,300 --> 00:57:02,420
I hope you will enjoy your heights now, you
will enjoy you glory and you will enjoy your noble work.

528
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,300
May God bless you.
