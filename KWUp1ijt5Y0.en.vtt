WEBVTT

03:36.930 --> 03:43.930
As

04:21.190 --> 04:28.190
I said yesterday, this is the field, field
where the light has to come. With so many

06:10.490 --> 06:17.490
lights, the field has to be enlightened. And
this field which is enlightened is enriched

06:24.279 --> 06:31.279
by nature, too. And when you were singing
I felt the clouds were catching the notes,

06:35.300 --> 06:42.300
weaving them within themselves and when it
would rain, the rain will sing the song again.

06:44.729 --> 06:51.729
As if the valleys were resounding so beautifully
and the echo was very gentle and filling the

06:55.440 --> 07:02.360
whole atmosphere. Perhaps you are not aware
of the subtle, of the Divine, how much It

07:02.360 --> 07:09.360
is anxious to work it out. But our trumpets
and our flutes and our drums have to be all

07:22.570 --> 07:29.570
right. There has to be coordination, complete
synchronizing, then the melody is played in

07:36.710 --> 07:43.710
a beautiful way. Clouds only carry the purest
water, the purest hymns.

07:49.990 --> 07:56.990
So when we are spreading the message, we have
to understand that it has to come from a pure

07:59.710 --> 08:06.710
source, purity is very important. I’ve already
talked about chastity part which is the Mooladhara,

08:09.139 --> 08:15.840
which is so important today; you can see it
clearly how important it is. But that’s

08:15.840 --> 08:22.840
not the end of it; that’s just the beginning,
just the beginning. But what we have to see

08:32.880 --> 08:39.880
is something very innate built within us.
And today as we are sitting in the heart of

08:43.630 --> 08:50.630
hearts that is Sheffield where the steel is
made, in the heart the steel, sometimes you

08:52.069 --> 08:59.069
need a part of steel also in the heart. We
have to see where are we lacking, what’s

09:04.209 --> 09:11.209
our basic problem. We should face it.

09:11.699 --> 09:18.699
So as English we are, we have to think how
our brains work, are used to work, how traditionally

09:24.030 --> 09:31.030
we have been brought to problems. When we
see around how we have accepted some things

09:32.610 --> 09:38.439
which were very absurd and nonsensical, say
in America or in France and other places,

09:38.439 --> 09:45.439
as if we have no personality of our own. What
did we give to others? What is the impression

09:51.420 --> 09:58.420
people carry about the British? Hippies, or
what do you call these days modern - the punks.

10:11.980 --> 10:18.980
What is it that we have to give? Is a honorable
image, is a honorable image of the British,

10:23.800 --> 10:30.800
of the English. We have to be honored, we
have to be honorable people, and we must keep

10:31.120 --> 10:38.120
our honor. And honor cannot come or cannot
be expressed if we are people who are cunning.

10:49.050 --> 10:56.050
That’s very superficial, anybody can find
out if we have that cunning within us. Now

10:59.790 --> 11:06.790
it has been a character, can be very cunning
- that’s what I discussed this morning.

11:07.980 --> 11:14.980
Be careful on that, be careful. That’s a
trick of the ego, don’t fall a prey to that.

11:21.350 --> 11:25.459
And that then works out in our languages also.

11:25.459 --> 11:31.490
Now English language is a specially honored
language now because it is the language of

11:31.490 --> 11:38.490
the Sahaja Yoga as well. Of course we use
Hindi, Marathi and then English. But English

11:42.620 --> 11:49.620
is the language in which My speeches are,
so it should be honored. We must have a sense

11:52.520 --> 11:59.520
of honor that comes by respecting. When you
respect yourself, you respect others. If you

12:00.760 --> 12:07.760
do not respect yourself, you cannot respect
others. And that’s what I’ve discovered

12:07.900 --> 12:14.900
that when people took to anti-culture and
all sorts of things the first thing they did

12:15.120 --> 12:20.529
was not to respect anything whatsoever.

12:20.529 --> 12:27.529
And yesterday only I discovered that the language
which is spoilt has come through this: is

12:28.089 --> 12:35.000
fashionable to speak with a funny accent,
and I was copying that the Americans speak

12:35.000 --> 12:42.000
like duck – quack, quack, quack. But the
English speak like a crow - caw, caw, caw

12:44.310 --> 12:51.310
- and we have real English language problem.
Just now Nick’s wife told Me that she can’t

12:53.149 --> 12:58.110
understand what English speak. I said, “Same
here, I don’t understand either.” It’s

12:58.110 --> 13:02.540
a language problem.

13:02.540 --> 13:08.910
One gentleman who came from India, very well
educated gentleman, did his MA in English,

13:08.910 --> 13:14.899
he came back and he said, “I had a language
problem there.”

13:14.899 --> 13:16.220
I said, “Why?”

13:16.220 --> 13:22.820
He said, “They speak all kinds, they divert
it every way and educated people talk like

13:22.820 --> 13:23.209
that.”

13:23.209 --> 13:30.209
And was surprised that it has also come from
anti-culture, is a fashion to speak like that.

13:30.500 --> 13:37.500
And I can’t follow. That means it is anti-God.
So you must respect your language. You might

13:44.050 --> 13:51.050
be acquiring it from hippie stage, or you
might be getting it, say, even from Cambridge

13:51.970 --> 13:58.970
or from Oxford or from public schools. Whatever
it is, whatever may be the source, either

14:00.810 --> 14:07.810
it is aggression on the language or no respect
to the language. So in language, in speaking

14:13.160 --> 14:20.110
the language, try to speak straightforward
English language.

14:20.110 --> 14:26.540
Because we are international people. We are
not English anymore. We are grown to be global

14:26.540 --> 14:33.540
people now. We have a global personality,
and as global people we have to speak a language

14:36.680 --> 14:42.850
which everybody can understand. We cannot
speak cockneyed language. I mean in India

14:42.850 --> 14:49.850
also we have lots of cockneyed. But Sahaja
Yogis don’t speak that language. You won’t

14:53.279 --> 15:00.220
understand that cockneyed language that we
speak even if you are an expert on any Indian

15:00.220 --> 15:07.220
language. So first of all, you must show respect
of your own language, more than anything else.

15:14.660 --> 15:21.660
If you cannot respect your country, your language,
your literature, your sublime things that

15:21.790 --> 15:28.790
are here, your buildings, how can you respect
anything else? This is your soil, which is

15:32.050 --> 15:37.470
not to be aggressed this way. That doesn’t
mean we become nationalist, I did not mean

15:37.470 --> 15:44.470
that, but to grow out as a tree you have to
know your soil and you have to respect and

15:45.130 --> 15:52.130
be honorable. Where is that English honor
which I used to hear about? Is lost in the

15:52.920 --> 15:59.920
thin air somewhere? An honorable person will
not keep back taxes, will not ill-treat his

16:02.519 --> 16:09.250
wife, will not ill-treat her husband, will
not talk rudely to them, would be respectable,

16:09.250 --> 16:16.250
will respect the children. First thing is
that he respects everybody’s freedom. If

16:18.860 --> 16:25.860
he’s mean, then he’s not honorable. If
he’s not generous, then he is not honorable.

16:31.810 --> 16:38.810
If he disobeys the law, he’s not honorable
either. Why should we disobey the law? I just

16:41.399 --> 16:46.769
don’t understand. Actually English laws
are meant for angels I tell you, horrible.

16:46.769 --> 16:53.769
But in that only the devils take advantage.
Doesn’t matter, laws are very good no doubt.

16:56.970 --> 17:03.970
But why should we break the laws unnecessarily?
If it is necessary, all right. But for every

17:04.880 --> 17:11.880
small thing if you start breaking the laws,
then we start breaking the laws of the Divine

17:12.179 --> 17:13.419
also.

17:13.419 --> 17:20.419
So we have to learn all these things. Let
us be in an honorable way, accept things which

17:21.659 --> 17:28.659
are good but not fashionable. Fashionable
things - now it is fashionable to be like

17:30.810 --> 17:37.810
this, it is fashionable to be like that. Now
what I feel that fashion only is accepted

17:38.379 --> 17:45.000
by people who have no personality at all.
Tomorrow somebody starts saying that “You

17:45.000 --> 17:52.000
put a empty tin of jam on your head.” Supposing,
I mean, if they say so, “You’ll look taller,”

17:55.080 --> 18:02.080
or something like that. I mean maybe a little,
or let the jam falls on your face. Any clownish

18:04.370 --> 18:11.370
nonsense we accept so easily. It’s all clownish,
and clowns are the only ones who copy like

18:13.500 --> 18:20.500
this because they have to amuse people by
clowning. But are we to become clowns now?

18:25.260 --> 18:32.260
So by this kind of diffidence in our character
that we try to copy others without understanding

18:33.230 --> 18:40.230
what they are doing, we are becoming clowns.
I mean you can see many like that.

18:43.639 --> 18:50.639
So the clownishness is now one of the characters
of the British. They really sometimes appear

18:52.620 --> 18:59.620
to Me like clowns. Because they try to copy
others and whenever you try to copy others,

19:02.909 --> 19:09.909
you are not the others. Like say we try to
copy, say for example, Americans - very difficult.

19:12.669 --> 19:19.669
They are so childish and stupid, we can’t
do that good, you see. I’ve seen a film

19:21.530 --> 19:28.530
of some Americans - I hope there are no Americans
sitting here - where they had about hundred

19:32.370 --> 19:39.370
people, actors and actresses above seventy
or eighty years of age all shaking, you see,

19:39.440 --> 19:44.889
and they all wearing funny dresses, you see,
half way missing, or this way missing, all

19:44.889 --> 19:51.889
sorts of things missing, you see, less clothes
than normal. And they were doing funny dances,

19:54.139 --> 20:01.139
you see, all walking with sticks and doing
shake. Or they were shaking already.

20:03.350 --> 20:10.350
Now for English they love to use their umbrellas
I think. So they look clownish because you

20:17.550 --> 20:24.550
don’t carry sticks, you carry umbrellas.
So trying to do something that is American

20:24.679 --> 20:31.679
would be stupid. There’s no need to copy
them. Even outside, then why inside? When

20:34.919 --> 20:41.919
you are a global personality, as in the nature
you can see a mango tree looks like a mango

20:44.460 --> 20:51.460
tree. It doesn’t try to become like an apple
tree, does it? And then that mango, when it

20:54.540 --> 21:00.409
is ripe, goes to the whole world. Whatever
is the best mango you can find it in Russia,

21:00.409 --> 21:06.679
you can find it in America, you can find it
all over. That’s how it becomes a global

21:06.679 --> 21:13.349
personality. But mango remains a mango; it
is not an apple. Who is going to import apples

21:13.349 --> 21:20.349
from India, in England? That would be stupid.

21:21.169 --> 21:28.129
So the personality that you are already, you
are a British personality, or English personality

21:28.129 --> 21:35.129
or an Irish personality, or whatever personality
you are, should be such is presentable to

21:36.470 --> 21:43.470
others to be cherished, to be enjoyed. How
is it possible? You have to be excellent,

21:44.940 --> 21:51.940
first class, top personality. So this clownishness
must be given up. And it has come so much

21:55.990 --> 22:02.990
in England that I feel the heart is absolutely
oppressed by this stupid things. But there

22:03.830 --> 22:08.990
are certain nonsensical things which have
come within us which we should give up. As

22:08.990 --> 22:15.990
I said, first of all the cunningness, then
in our language there should be straightforward

22:16.560 --> 22:23.560
expression, no sarcasm. There’s no intelligence
in sarcasm.

22:27.820 --> 22:34.820
Saying something nice to others is a great
art. Have we developed that art of saying

22:42.639 --> 22:49.639
something nice to others? This art is to be
developed by Sahaja Yogis, how to say something

22:54.990 --> 23:01.990
sweet and nice to others. If you can develop
the gentle method of saying nice things, then

23:12.300 --> 23:19.300
later on you will see you will be able to
do nice things for others - little, little

23:21.310 --> 23:27.760
things here and there. Like the little girl
bringing beautiful pink flowers one after

23:27.760 --> 23:34.760
another. You are nice to Me no doubt, but
to each other and to others who come to us?

23:40.659 --> 23:47.659
So how to say nice things, what to say, when
to say, this we must learn. And so we can

23:53.629 --> 24:00.629
establish communication. Self-consciousness,
self-opinionatedness can never give you that.

24:04.570 --> 24:11.570
“I don’t care, all right let him be angry,
so what do I care?” Very common expression.

24:15.700 --> 24:21.790
But if you say to the person, “Why are you
angry? I do care when you are angry. What’s

24:21.790 --> 24:28.790
the problem? Can I not help you there?”
Finished. He’ll say, “What sort of a angel

24:29.490 --> 24:33.649
I’m meeting here?”

24:33.649 --> 24:38.800
Like yesterday the fellow was very aggressive
and he asked Me about heaven and hell and

24:38.800 --> 24:45.800
all that. I was least bothered. He was neutralized.
You must learn, this is an art which one has

24:49.849 --> 24:56.849
to learn. Don’t be proud of your harsh tongues
and your hot tempers. Don’t be proud. “I’m

24:57.070 --> 25:02.639
angry with him.” So what, is it a very good
thing to be angry with others? “I got very

25:02.639 --> 25:09.639
angry,” you see, with very great pride they
will tell Me. “I got very angry for that.”

25:14.240 --> 25:19.950
‘Why? As Christ has said, only one anger
is allowed: if somebody says something against

25:19.950 --> 25:26.950
your Mother that He’s not going to tolerate.
But that, too, controlled. Yesterday many

25:28.159 --> 25:35.159
were angry but it was all right. I know how
to manage things.

25:36.720 --> 25:43.720
So we have to learn also to tell ourselves,
“Let us not be so self-opinionated.” We

25:47.020 --> 25:54.020
have to learn a lot. There is so much to be
seen, so much to be learnt, so much to be

25:55.909 --> 26:02.909
understood, outside also. Like British are
absolutely insular by temperament. Another

26:09.990 --> 26:16.990
matching with them are Japanese, equal type.
Japanese also don’t talk much but don’t

26:19.389 --> 26:25.300
absorb anything whatsoever. You can imagine
three hundred years English were in India,

26:25.300 --> 26:32.300
they learnt nothing. Can you imagine? Can
you believe it? Three hundred years, generations,

26:35.230 --> 26:42.230
seven-eight generations they were in India.
While here, when the Indians come, they too

26:42.869 --> 26:47.899
have no personality. They pick up your dresses,
they pick up your language, they pick up everything.

26:47.899 --> 26:54.109
They talk with the same slang and hundred
times they’ll say dirty words in it and

26:54.109 --> 27:01.109
they’ll say, “Yes man, no man, what man”
- to a woman also, unisex. They have too much

27:05.580 --> 27:12.580
absorbage. They absorb everything while you
don’t absorb anything. So these are two

27:16.810 --> 27:18.220
extreme cases.

27:18.220 --> 27:25.220
So as it is said in Sanskrit that what is
the difference between the swan and hamsa

27:32.349 --> 27:39.349
and the crow? No, no sorry, crow is black
so I’m sorry - hamsa and what do you call

27:40.250 --> 27:46.520
that? Crane, crane. What is the difference
between a crane - yes it is crane, isn’t

27:46.520 --> 27:49.129
it Gavin, in the water?

27:49.129 --> 27:56.129
Crane. So what is the difference between the
crane and the swan? So when they have to discriminate

28:02.429 --> 28:09.429
between water and milk, then you can find
out who is the crane and who is the swan.

28:13.149 --> 28:20.149
Nirak shira viveket. Vivek is proper decision.
So if you put water mixed with milk before

28:24.849 --> 28:31.849
a swan, the swan will just suck in the milk
and the crane will suck the whole. He wouldn’t

28:34.020 --> 28:40.379
know. So that is what is, again we come to
the same point, is discretion that we have

28:40.379 --> 28:40.629
to develop.

28:40.460 --> 28:42.139
[Shri Mataji interrupts Her talk to point
out people] There are people they are looking

28:42.139 --> 28:49.139
out for us. They are lost there. They are
Sahaja Yogis. I think they saw us here. They

28:53.750 --> 28:56.080
saw Me.

28:56.080 --> 29:03.080
So it is the discretion that we have to pick
up all that is good, all that is nice, from

29:04.409 --> 29:11.409
everywhere, which is such a lot, such a lot.
Like I would say, what’s nice about British?

29:14.540 --> 29:21.540
Let’s see. Can you tell Me, who is going
to tell Me that?

29:46.609 --> 29:53.609
Yogi: They have a great deal of tolerance.

29:54.570 --> 30:01.570
Shri Mataji: What did he say? Tolerance. No,
no, not at all. It has to be a common quality,

30:03.339 --> 30:10.339
whether you are a Sahaja Yogi or not. Tolerance
is the least, that’s something lacking.

30:12.470 --> 30:19.020
Yogi: They’re good leaders, Mother.

30:19.020 --> 30:24.740
Shri Mataji: You think so?

30:24.740 --> 30:29.690
Yogi: Fair play.

30:29.690 --> 30:36.690
Shri Mataji: Fair play I don’t know now
- that might have been. They were not very

30:39.710 --> 30:46.710
fair with Indians, were they? They were not
very fair with Chinese, never. Still go further.

30:49.369 --> 30:55.119
Yogi: Talking about the weather.

30:55.119 --> 31:02.119
Shri Mataji: That would be bad weather. Yes,
I mean superficiality, but that’s not a

31:05.730 --> 31:07.030
good thing.

31:07.030 --> 31:12.250
Yogi: Shri Mataji, they have very sharp minds.

31:12.250 --> 31:16.169
Shri Mataji: Sharp what? Sharp minds.

31:16.169 --> 31:17.470
Yogi: Intelligence.

31:17.470 --> 31:21.349
Shri Mataji: You’re near, but not there.

31:21.349 --> 31:23.750
Yogi: Inventions, Mother.

31:23.750 --> 31:30.750
Shri Mataji: Not so much, Americans are better.

31:30.929 --> 31:33.560
Yogi: Subtle.

31:33.560 --> 31:40.560
Shri Mataji: Subtle. I wouldn’t say that.
Not that, not so much.

31:46.639 --> 31:53.359
Yogi: They want to help others.

31:53.359 --> 31:56.720
Shri Mataji: Seldom.

31:56.720 --> 31:58.960
Yogi: Manipulative

31:58.960 --> 32:03.450
Shri Mataji: That’s bad.

32:03.450 --> 32:06.810
Yogi: Loyal, Mother.

32:06.810 --> 32:13.810
Shri Mataji: Loyal? They create disloyalties,
problems. They make people fight.

32:16.510 --> 32:23.510
Yogi: Once they find something good Mother
they will stick onto it.

32:28.500 --> 32:34.329
Shri Mataji: I wish they could. I wish they
could, but the way they disappeared, every

32:34.329 --> 32:40.159
time we had programs after that what I find
everything disappeared. Sticking on quality

32:40.159 --> 32:42.050
is missing.

32:42.050 --> 32:48.060
Now is all right everybody has said? I wish
you had all those qualities, you could, why

32:48.060 --> 32:53.929
not? So all the qualities that are desired
have been expressed, but what really are?

32:53.929 --> 32:57.589
Should I tell you?

32:57.589 --> 33:04.589
Scholarship. Scholarship. Sahaja Yoga? Read
everything. Sahaja Yoga means Kundalini, means

33:05.849 --> 33:12.849
this, that, go to the library, find out everything.
Just know it. Scholarship. That’s their

33:16.369 --> 33:23.369
quality. And this has to spread all over.
You agree there? The scholarship in Sahaja

33:31.290 --> 33:38.290
Yoga has to spread all over the world. The
women specially want to compete with men here.

33:44.579 --> 33:51.579
Very difficult, English women, not easy. Not
all, but some. They should become scholars

33:51.770 --> 33:58.770
of Sahaja Yoga. I’m surprised people like
Derek or people like Hesta could not see the

34:01.020 --> 34:04.659
point.

34:04.659 --> 34:11.659
Scholarship is the thing and that’s why
they’re honored everywhere. They are scholars.

34:14.260 --> 34:21.260
And see now, heart becoming a scholar. That’s
the integration of the brain and the heart.

34:31.669 --> 34:38.520
We have so many scholars of Sahaja Yoga in
England. We might get one there and one here

34:38.520 --> 34:45.080
and there. Like we can say in Switzerland
we’ve got Gregoire and Arneau. Scholarship

34:45.080 --> 34:52.080
- how many are there? And very deep scholarship.
And that is what you have to develop more,

35:02.380 --> 35:09.380
specially the ladies have to learn a lot,
is knowledge. To understand all the intricacies,

35:18.270 --> 35:25.270
all the delicacies, and to work it out in
that scholarly way, is the way you will really

35:28.570 --> 35:35.570
do greatest service to Sahaja Yoga. And is
such a honorable thing to be a scholar and

35:39.609 --> 35:46.609
once you are a scholar, this knowledge goes
into your head goes to your heart also. Scholarship

35:48.960 --> 35:55.960
in every subject. Scholars are different from
inventive people. They may know very little

35:56.750 --> 36:03.750
and can invent something, that’s a different
thing. But that doesn’t mean you go and

36:06.490 --> 36:13.089
read Vivekananda and all that, doesn’t mean
that. But you go in every library, every place

36:13.089 --> 36:20.089
and discover the Truth. Blake - scholar, so
many scholars in this country, most of them

36:27.440 --> 36:34.440
were Realized Souls. In England we have the
maximum number, in the West I’m saying,

36:36.119 --> 36:43.119
maximum number of scholars, who were Realized
Souls, in such a small, little country like

36:45.750 --> 36:48.420
that.

36:48.420 --> 36:55.420
In India of course we had saints who were
scholars, saints who were not scholars. So

36:55.480 --> 37:02.480
the scholarship part is your responsibility,
and like a scholar you have to be above many

37:05.079 --> 37:12.079
things. A scholar doesn’t stoop down to
nonsense. He doesn’t take to superficial

37:12.530 --> 37:19.530
thing. It’s below his dignity to behave
in childish manner or to take to sex and all

37:19.780 --> 37:26.780
this nonsensical ideas. But the basic quality
you have got which is something so great I

37:28.210 --> 37:34.710
feel, because heart becoming a scholar is
something very great. It’s a balance, it’s

37:34.710 --> 37:41.710
a real balance, and that’s the steel, that
is the steel of England, the scholarship.

37:45.089 --> 37:52.089
That’s how a New Jerusalem has to be built
in, not the old one where they were only faithfuls

37:53.240 --> 38:00.240
just going down singing songs and hymns, nothing
- but scholarship, the complete knowledge.

38:02.279 --> 38:06.750
They know everything about Kundalini, they
know all about chakras, they know all details

38:06.750 --> 38:13.750
about it and, if you may please, your Mother
has spoken in England the maximum number of

38:15.190 --> 38:22.190
lectures, because there are scholars.

38:24.650 --> 38:31.650
So preserve that, develop that, then only
you will have all other qualities which you

38:33.259 --> 38:40.259
have described just now. But remember that
you are yogis, but scholars in your subject.

38:40.720 --> 38:44.910
Take any subject that you are dealing with
- even ordinary thing, we can say if you are

38:44.910 --> 38:51.910
a carpenter you must know everything about
wood. What is this wood, from where it comes,

38:53.099 --> 38:58.710
what is it, what can be used for, what is
the density of this wood, what is the chemical

38:58.710 --> 39:05.710
composition, everything you must know about
it. And this is what you have to give to other

39:15.690 --> 39:18.609
people of the world.

39:18.609 --> 39:25.500
Once you start doing all this, you will give
up all the malpractices which British have

39:25.500 --> 39:30.339
taken to. First of all they are the worst
of all, is to create problems between two

39:30.339 --> 39:37.339
persons - they are good at it. Like, now you
see now in South Africa what they did, create

39:40.750 --> 39:47.750
problem between one shade of black with another
shade of black. Very clever. Now when this

39:50.259 --> 39:54.700
scholarship was perverted they were the ones,
you know they were the ones who started this

39:54.700 --> 40:00.970
idea that the blacks are primitive. They are
the ones who introduced this idea. The same

40:00.970 --> 40:07.970
scholarship used for bad purposes. Who gave
these ideas were about four or five writers

40:08.269 --> 40:15.269
who said they were primitive. Very nice - brand
them as primitive, because scholars after

40:16.359 --> 40:23.359
all can brand anything as anything.

40:23.990 --> 40:30.869
So it is necessary for us to bring goodness.
To bring benevolence in this world we must

40:30.869 --> 40:37.869
write benevolent things, write something idealistic,
something higher, something hopeful, something

40:46.250 --> 40:53.250
which gives them a new dimension of understanding.
All the Sahaja Yogis must start writing. Ramdas

40:58.809 --> 41:05.809
Swami has said that, “Every day you must
write something.” Write diaries, write novels,

41:07.559 --> 41:14.559
write articles, do what you like - poems,
poetry. All kinds of things you can do if

41:18.930 --> 41:25.930
you just know that you have to be yogi scholars,
but not intellectuals. Intellectuals have

41:30.119 --> 41:37.119
the knowledge of others, but scholars built
up their knowledge on the true knowledge of

41:37.869 --> 41:44.869
others. That’s the difference between a
scholar and an intellectual. Intellectual

41:47.220 --> 41:54.009
has nothing of his own, he’s a confused
person and he doesn’t want to say, because

41:54.009 --> 42:00.430
he’s so frightened that if he says anything
that “This is what I think,” then people

42:00.430 --> 42:07.430
might say that he is a man of domination or
something like that. You need not be a graduate,

42:12.130 --> 42:19.130
you need not be anything, but that quality
is built within you, which is a very big thing

42:23.549 --> 42:24.640
and is very much connected.

42:24.640 --> 42:31.640
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know that the heart
is surrounded by seven main auras and these

42:37.670 --> 42:44.670
come from the brain, which is the seat. Now
in the center, at the Brahmarandra we have

42:48.019 --> 42:55.019
got the Heart Chakra, all right? The heart
is here and around it are all these auras,

42:57.799 --> 43:04.799
if you see in the brain. In the same way they
are surrounding the heart. So if you know

43:12.119 --> 43:19.119
about them, it will circulate, the knowledge
will circulate, but circulate with love, without

43:24.130 --> 43:31.130
any aggressiveness, without any showing off,
without any cunning, without any sarcasm,

43:36.680 --> 43:43.680
in a full, straightforward, loving manner.

43:46.910 --> 43:53.910
But for that we have to remember that we have
developed lots of antidotes in England. Like

43:56.079 --> 44:03.079
the words I have seen people use very common
is: “That may be too much; it may be too

44:06.089 --> 44:13.089
much.” They’re frightened. “One shouldn’t
say too much.” You should! When you say

44:18.089 --> 44:25.089
too much at least little bit will go into
their heads. So you have to say too much,

44:28.119 --> 44:35.119
say what you want. There should be exuberance,
exuberance of your ideas so that something

44:42.029 --> 44:46.539
goes into their heads, they know that you
are sincere, you’re saying it sincerely,

44:46.539 --> 44:53.539
you cannot contain within yourself, emphatically
you have to say things. That’s what everybody

44:54.119 --> 45:01.119
did. All those who were great incarnations
said it with such concern, with such force.

45:03.579 --> 45:10.579
In the same way you have to say, without any
fear. “Oh that may be too much, Mother it

45:11.519 --> 45:18.519
was too much for him.” Let him be blasted.
Doesn’t matter. Say everything that you

45:21.470 --> 45:28.470
have to say absolutely with full heart. But
when people come to Sahaja Yoga, when they

45:31.539 --> 45:38.539
come for, say, a workshop or something, we
try to be the same party people, like in the

45:45.299 --> 45:49.529
party you see, “What will you have?”

45:49.529 --> 45:56.529
Then they will say, “All right, let me think
what did I have yesterday, so I’ll have

45:57.690 --> 46:03.170
today this thing.” It’s like a shopping
going on.

46:03.170 --> 46:10.170
No, you have to say, “We have this and please
have it now, otherwise you won’t have it.”

46:10.619 --> 46:17.619
This is the time, let them say what they like.
Is important. I see sometimes your SDP conferences

46:31.230 --> 46:35.029
and all this, baap re baap [note: this is
an expression in Hindi to express disappointment],

46:35.029 --> 46:40.200
the way they speak, they just blast you, I
mean hammer in your head. And why should we

46:40.200 --> 46:47.200
not when this is the truth? Why should we
not tell them, and talk to them in that manner?

46:48.480 --> 46:55.480
We think by being gentle - all right gentleness
is different, but I mean to say by saying

46:57.019 --> 47:04.019
less than I see, understatement is typical
English statement. “That might be too much.”

47:04.579 --> 47:11.579
In Sahaja Yoga it is such a lot that how much
are you going to pour out? Can never be too

47:13.180 --> 47:19.029
much, so be careful on that. When you have
to say it, say it in a very blasty way, doesn’t

47:19.029 --> 47:26.029
matter. What are they going to do? They can’t
crucify Me this time, can they? They dare

47:26.599 --> 47:31.529
not. Otherwise perfectly all right, nothing
can touch Me, and even crucifixion cannot

47:31.529 --> 47:38.529
touch Me, you know that. So you better say
what you have found out in a big way and tell

47:39.200 --> 47:45.259
them in a big way. Of course loving and gentle
manner, but tell them, the concern should

47:45.259 --> 47:52.259
be there. All right? Now this is what it is,
one has to understand, that there is nothing

47:55.289 --> 48:02.289
“Say little bit.” Then they think he is
a shaky man. But when they sing horrible songs

48:05.170 --> 48:10.910
on the mike, eating the mike I say, calling,
“eating the mike music.” They go on, you

48:10.910 --> 48:17.910
see, aggressing on the mike and people go
mad with it, they like it. I don’t say you

48:20.259 --> 48:27.259
aggress, but don’t say anything less, understatement
is not needed. There should be not be any

48:28.249 --> 48:33.630
balancing in that.

48:33.630 --> 48:40.630
Those people who will be appeased by that
will not be good Sahaja Yogis. They cannot

48:44.700 --> 48:51.700
come in the Kingdom of God. We don’t have
to be begging of them but we have to honor

48:56.480 --> 49:02.839
them, we have to respect them, we have to
be kind to them. But we have to give them

49:02.839 --> 49:08.700
what we have. Like in the family you go, you
get everything from the fridge and give it

49:08.700 --> 49:14.950
to them, they’ll be very happy - take it
whatever you like. What a spread. But if you

49:14.950 --> 49:21.950
put one little fish and two eggs for ten people
with one chili to say that it is Sahaja Yoga,

49:28.519 --> 49:35.519
maybe a lemon, they will think, “What’s
this going on here? Wishy-washy stuff.”

49:36.819 --> 49:43.819
Now that’s one thing. Secondly there are
words that people use very commonly: “That

49:49.769 --> 49:56.769
is very fussy.” That shows your fears. In
Sahaja Yoga nothing is fussy, nothing is fussy.

50:06.940 --> 50:12.970
Always it is so. “It is very fussy, it is
this is fussy that is fussy.” It is coming

50:12.970 --> 50:19.970
to such an extent that people now like beggarish
existence; they want to dress up like beggars,

50:22.529 --> 50:29.529
rustic, nonsensical things, worn-out clothes,
worn-out faces.

50:30.650 --> 50:34.339
I was telling Gavin the other day, “Why
do you all like sand color? There’s no sand

50:34.339 --> 50:41.339
here. Is something Arabic in you that you
like all sand everywhere?” As it is the

50:41.450 --> 50:48.450
hair are blonde, face is sand-like, clothes
are sand. Mountains of sand, walking around.

51:00.680 --> 51:07.680
Why not be colorful? Why not wear colors?
Sahaja Yogis must wear colors. Of course you

51:11.039 --> 51:15.910
should not be dandies. I must tell you that,
otherwise you will be dandies, you see, like

51:15.910 --> 51:22.910
wearing shocking pinks by men, and sort of
thing. I don’t mean that. But you shouldn’t

51:23.769 --> 51:30.769
just go about with sand color and a grey color.
If you start wearing something nice, they

51:32.839 --> 51:35.019
will also produce.

51:35.019 --> 51:40.599
I wanted to buy a sweater for Gavin in green
color. I couldn’t get one light green. I

51:40.599 --> 51:45.069
said, “Let’s have one.” I said, “You
look.” No, couldn’t get one for him. They

51:45.069 --> 51:52.069
don’t make it - only sand. And I got it.
Or else grey. Already the sky is grey, faces

51:57.579 --> 52:03.999
are grey, dresses are grey, they wear grey
suits, the horses are grey, the world is around

52:03.999 --> 52:10.999
grey – all horrible. And then wear a grey
dress to match with it. So, there’s nothing

52:14.239 --> 52:21.239
like fussy in Sahaja Yoga but you should not
be childish, frivolous, stupid. And you should

52:21.289 --> 52:28.289
not be also dandyish, showing off. Like I
have seen people painting their car with gold

52:30.999 --> 52:37.999
and all that nonsense, or wearing a bow tie
and a dinner jacket and walking on the streets

52:41.720 --> 52:48.720
of Oxford Street to match with these horrible
Hare Ramas there, to make a contrast to them.

52:54.079 --> 53:01.079
That’s not necessary. On this also you could
be scholars, you can find out.

53:07.460 --> 53:14.460
About children, I’m very much worried now,
much more since I heard about this three-year-old

53:15.980 --> 53:22.980
girl. And I have to say that your children
are precious, they’re wonderful people.

53:24.670 --> 53:30.799
In the beginning they have suffered because
of you, but they come out of it, and they

53:30.799 --> 53:36.829
become so great. But you must learn one thing,
is to be very attentive to your children,

53:36.829 --> 53:42.470
don’t neglect them. Teach them habits by
which they do not learn things which will

53:42.470 --> 53:49.470
destroy them. Like every child picks up everything,
puts it in the mouth. We too here in England

53:53.390 --> 53:59.029
or anywhere in the West, people just put their
fingers in the mouth like that they will go.

53:59.029 --> 54:04.539
Anything they’ll just - supposing they are
opening a can. Now the can spills out some

54:04.539 --> 54:11.539
jam, so they put it in the fingers inside.
No. That jam can, might be having some germs.

54:13.730 --> 54:17.789
So anything that is to be put in the mouth
you must wash.

54:17.789 --> 54:24.789
That’s now has to be the law for Sahaja
Yogis, because so many germs, so many things,

54:25.200 --> 54:29.440
and for children specially they must be told.
If anything falls on the ground it’s a very

54:29.440 --> 54:33.999
mundane thing but you must learn how we tell
our children. Anything falls on the ground,

54:33.999 --> 54:37.369
immediately you’ll pick up and throw away
somewhere and wash our hands. We’ll just

54:37.369 --> 54:42.349
say, “No, no, no, no, no, no, not that.”
Even from the mouth, if something falls out

54:42.349 --> 54:49.349
you are not to pick up. Unless and until you
really fanatically do that, your children

54:51.480 --> 54:58.480
cannot be saved from all kinds of infections
that are around. India is full of parasites

54:58.799 --> 55:03.650
and we have many more, I mean we are the country
where we breed and look after them and cherish

55:03.650 --> 55:10.650
them I think. All kinds of parasites we have
had, politically also many parasites on us,

55:13.460 --> 55:20.460
but all said and done, we know how to keep
out of them, you see, and that’s how we

55:23.380 --> 55:27.279
have to really condition our children.

55:27.279 --> 55:34.279
Secondly, never to leave your child alone
anywhere. Learn a lesson. At any cost you

55:37.329 --> 55:42.720
should not leave the child alone. You can
leave it with somebody who can look after

55:42.720 --> 55:48.390
the child, who can run a crèche, who can
do something of that kind. But pay attention

55:48.390 --> 55:55.390
to this point that there should be no loneliness
for a child. Child must be made to sleep in

55:57.759 --> 56:04.759
your room, maybe another cot, maybe crib.
When slightly grown up, still should be with

56:06.039 --> 56:11.749
you, if there’s a grown-up another child
you can make, or some aunt or somebody sleeping

56:11.749 --> 56:18.749
with. But don’t make children feel that
they are lonely. Psychologically it will affect,

56:19.319 --> 56:25.249
and also physically there could be a problem.
We never, never, never allow our children

56:25.249 --> 56:27.880
to be alone, do you know that, in India?

56:27.880 --> 56:34.819
I mean we are ourselves surprised how the
children just go out. Now supposing some child,

56:34.819 --> 56:39.109
say about five-year-old says, “I’m going
to a candy shop.” Nothing doing. Mother

56:39.109 --> 56:44.890
will say, “All right, when I go you will
buy it, candy.” I mean when My daughters

56:44.890 --> 56:51.890
were not married, till then they never went
out alone, can you believe it? Never. Even

56:52.720 --> 56:56.849
to school if they were going, they were in
the car with the driver. Even if they were

56:56.849 --> 57:01.759
going to colleges they were going in the car
with the driver. Never alone. And if they

57:01.759 --> 57:08.759
were going, say, by buses or anything, later
on when they went to higher education, they

57:09.220 --> 57:16.220
were going with friends. Safety of children
has to be looked after in this negative atmosphere

57:19.349 --> 57:25.670
everywhere. We are very good because we have
this challenge all the time, so we are very

57:25.670 --> 57:32.359
careful, and you people have to be now made
more aware towards your children.

57:32.359 --> 57:38.380
But don’t spoil them, you spoil your children
too much. I know they are very joy-giving

57:38.380 --> 57:43.509
because they are Realized Souls. But tell
them, “You are Realized Souls and you cannot

57:43.509 --> 57:49.549
be dishonorable.” But not at the time. I’ve
seen that you correct your children when they’ll

57:49.549 --> 57:54.470
misbehave, “Don’t do that!” That’s
not the way. Then you dishonor. You sit down

57:54.470 --> 57:59.609
with them, have a conference. “We’ll have
a conference now,” you tell them. “We’ll

57:59.609 --> 58:06.609
sit down.” So let them feel, let them sit
on their chairs like a conference hall, and

58:09.309 --> 58:14.880
tell them, “Now see we are all Sahaja Yogis.
You are Sahaja Yogis, too, and the whole world

58:14.880 --> 58:20.499
is watching you. You have to be honorable
children. You have to behave yourself, you

58:20.499 --> 58:24.599
have to do this way. We have to share our
things otherwise they will say you are not

58:24.599 --> 58:31.579
Sahaja Yogi. You have to have dignity.”
You talk to them, develop their personality

58:31.579 --> 58:35.950
that way, so that they know they have to be
majestic, they have to be regal. They cannot

58:35.950 --> 58:39.619
be cheapish like others.

58:39.619 --> 58:45.289
Because all the time we say, “Don’t touch
that, don’t do that.” They don’t know,

58:45.289 --> 58:52.289
they are confused. Talk to them, sit down,
talk to them - what is to be done, how we

58:52.759 --> 58:59.539
have to behave, how to say nice things, how
to help others, how to share your things,

58:59.539 --> 59:06.539
how to give your toys, how to keep your things,
how to be neat, how to be tidy. It’s a training,

59:07.619 --> 59:14.619
that’s what you have to do. And children
also learn from your own behavior. Now you

59:15.769 --> 59:20.619
tell your children not to drink and if you
drink like a fish, then how will they listen

59:20.619 --> 59:26.559
to you? In the same way in Sahaja Yoga also,
you do not meditate, you are not disciplined,

59:26.559 --> 59:33.559
you live in a very untidy manner, you are
extremely careless, you do not honor people,

59:33.769 --> 59:40.769
your tongue is very loose, or you are very
sharp, children pick up. They absorb these

59:41.630 --> 59:43.099
things so quickly. It’s amazing how children
absorb.

59:43.099 --> 59:45.519
Once I had taken a child to a circus just
- he was a very good child, a Realized Soul.

59:45.519 --> 59:46.749
We went there and the joker, you see, he took
out his upper pant just while going on a swing,

59:46.749 --> 59:47.920
so it was a big feat, you see, a joker. So
we came home, he also took out his pant.

59:47.920 --> 59:48.579
I said, “Why?”

59:48.579 --> 59:50.660
He said, “In the circus how he did I’m
going to do the same way.”

59:50.660 --> 59:54.420
Imagine, that’s the only thing he picked
up. I said, “But that was a joker, you are

59:54.420 --> 59:57.380
not a joker are you?”

59:57.380 --> 59:59.499
“No I’m not.”

59:59.499 --> 01:00:03.039
“And better wear your pant.”

01:00:03.039 --> 01:00:10.039
So children pick up wrong things because easy
to pick up that. So don’t do anything wrong.

01:00:12.999 --> 01:00:18.499
Another is husband/wife should never quarrel
in the presence of children. If you want to

01:00:18.499 --> 01:00:25.499
quarrel I can even lend you some sticks, you
can fight. Fight in your bedrooms, do what

01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:32.880
you like. You can break the heads or break
the hearts or do what you like, but outside

01:00:34.729 --> 01:00:41.729
your rooms you are wonderful husband and wife.
At least let your children be good, enjoying

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.539
husband and wife. Actually it is stupid to
fight because you must learn how to enjoy

01:00:48.539 --> 01:00:54.239
each other.

01:00:54.239 --> 01:01:01.239
So we come from scholarship to the scholarship
about children. Some people have to take it

01:01:02.599 --> 01:01:08.519
up seriously. Of course there is a little
book which Louise has nicely done up, but

01:01:08.519 --> 01:01:15.499
is not sufficient. Some three-four people
have to sit down, or some ladies could do

01:01:15.499 --> 01:01:22.420
it with some doctor there or something. Sit
down with the full compiling of the ideas

01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:29.420
of Sahaja Yoga about children. Another one
can do the education, because Sahaja Yoga

01:01:30.619 --> 01:01:37.619
will be boring for you. What will you do?
So much to be done about the education of

01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:46.589
the children. Is very important because every
time I go to a place, there’s a school being

01:01:46.589 --> 01:01:51.729
started, “What have we to do for the school?
How are we to conduct?” Now why not you

01:01:51.729 --> 01:01:57.839
people make some research and give Me the
ideas and I’ll put it through? I’m good

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:04.839
at correcting than creating, I think nowadays,
because so much I have created. Whatever I

01:02:04.859 --> 01:02:11.859
have created is to be rearranged and consolidated.
So I can consolidate whatever you give Me,

01:02:12.630 --> 01:02:16.119
I can consolidate, I can put right, I can
correct it.

01:02:16.119 --> 01:02:23.119
So best thing is now to form a committee for
this. One for children, one for book on children,

01:02:24.910 --> 01:02:31.910
on Sahaja Yoga. What Mother has to say about,
you can use My quotations. Then a book about

01:02:32.229 --> 01:02:39.229
the education of children. Third book has
to be about the married life. That’s how

01:02:39.749 --> 01:02:44.979
you can go on compiling, about the social
life, about the politics, has to come from

01:02:44.979 --> 01:02:51.979
England. A series, so much to be done in England.
Because people read that, it can be always

01:02:58.170 --> 01:03:04.589
translated from one to another. Is very easy.
So I would request you all to put your mind

01:03:04.589 --> 01:03:10.229
to this whatever are your interests you should
work it out and put it in the language of

01:03:10.229 --> 01:03:17.229
Sahaja Yoga. Every sort - sports, you can
take to gardening, or anything, even machinery.

01:03:19.239 --> 01:03:23.430
Bring it to the level of Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:28.680
Like computer, now all the developing countries
want to develop computers. Now we must find

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:35.680
out what are the problems of computerization,
then how it is going to affect socially, deeply,

01:03:35.910 --> 01:03:40.710
in the future, what can happen if we just
develop computers and nothing else, how if

01:03:40.710 --> 01:03:47.710
it is one-sided movement then how the whole
suffers. Like that a new dimension, a new

01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:57.220
all-pervading, solution of everything can
be done. And that can be a quite a big eye-opener

01:04:00.849 --> 01:04:05.489
to people who do not want to commit the same
mistakes that you have committed.

01:04:05.489 --> 01:04:10.930
I must say this Affluent Society and all these
books that Galbraith wrote was very helpful

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:17.930
to some people, and that’s how it should
be. So you can guide people who want to be

01:04:18.119 --> 01:04:25.119
like you, and you can guide the people who
are like you and who have to change. It should

01:04:26.859 --> 01:04:32.170
be your idea. Drama - what’s wrong with
our drama, what’s wrong with that and how

01:04:32.170 --> 01:04:38.239
we can improve it. Everyone of you is capable
of contributing something like that. So those

01:04:38.239 --> 01:04:43.009
who are interested in different, various type
of things, in this seminar you can decide

01:04:43.009 --> 01:04:48.170
what one likes and what another thing - like
even racial discrimination we can take a subject

01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:53.140
like that somebody can work it out. Why racial
discrimination has come, what are the bad

01:04:53.140 --> 01:04:58.729
effects of racial discrimination? If it comes
from English, they will say, “What generous,

01:04:58.729 --> 01:05:04.170
good people there are, how they understand
the feelings and how they …” That will

01:05:04.170 --> 01:05:07.549
be very soothing if it comes on the other
side.

01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:12.499
Then now we have a problem of women asking
for their rights and all that what you call

01:05:12.499 --> 01:05:16.890
feminist movement - what is wrong with the
feminist movement, how they have gone wrong,

01:05:16.890 --> 01:05:22.400
and all those things. In every subject, even
in economics and everything, you can go forward

01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:28.299
with the scholarly ideas. You can take help
from other countries also who - we have scholars

01:05:28.299 --> 01:05:33.009
everywhere. But we have maximum number of
scholars here. And this is what we have to

01:05:33.009 --> 01:05:36.049
do in this land of She-field.

01:05:36.049 --> 01:05:42.960
May God bless you all.

01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:49.960
Should we meditate for about say, ten minutes?
Will be good idea, just to meditate and to

01:05:55.519 --> 01:06:02.519
find out what chakras are catching, to find
out what side is weak. Now if your left side

01:06:04.319 --> 01:06:09.759
is weak, put your left hand towards Me and
right hand towards the Mother Earth. If the

01:06:09.759 --> 01:06:15.460
right side is weak you put the right hand
towards Me and the left hand up there. Now

01:06:15.460 --> 01:06:21.900
if both are all right, when they normalize
you put both of them towards Me, all right?

01:06:21.900 --> 01:06:28.900
For example, now you can tell because you
are in east end, what’s the problem of east

01:06:31.289 --> 01:06:38.289
end is. Survey it. You should find out the
problems of east end. I remember you told

01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:50.039
Me about some Sikhs, what they were doing,
drinking so much and doing all these things

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:56.219
which is against, against Nanak Sahib. And
all these things if you tell, the way they

01:06:56.219 --> 01:07:03.219
run after white skin. Yes, that’s what it
is. So face-to-face let us see what is wrong

01:07:06.119 --> 01:07:13.029
with us. What is wrong with you? With what
is wrong with others? Let us see as a witness,

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:18.239
not identified with anything. So if you tell
all those things you see - what is that, what

01:07:18.239 --> 01:07:25.239
makes people that way? You go into it from
both the sides, and you can give real good

01:07:31.390 --> 01:07:38.390
solutions, you can give solutions. For example
there are doctors who can make a book with

01:07:39.479 --> 01:07:46.479
the divine knowledge related to the medicine.
There are psychologists, they can make a book

01:07:47.509 --> 01:07:52.549
- Gregoire I think, Rustom has done a good
job, I don’t know. Now by the way I must

01:07:52.549 --> 01:07:59.549
ask who has got Rustom’s book? You have
got? Derek you have?

01:08:13.259 --> 01:08:20.259
Yogi: No I haven’t, Mother. I haven’t
seen it.

01:08:34.180 --> 01:08:41.180
Shri Mataji: Somebody who is not here may
be having. Who else? Ask Maureen. Is she here?

01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:59.980
Maureen? She’s not here? Ask her maybe.
Do you think so, Maureen may be having? No.

01:09:05.299 --> 01:09:12.299
I just don’t understand. I think you better
see in your office maybe, Gavin, just have

01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:35.880
a look, no? Because I gave it to someone,
because it’s not there in the house, can’t

01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:44.500
find it. We had found his book, isn’t it?
No. All right, he’s a scholar, no doubt,

01:09:51.989 --> 01:09:57.920
and I wanted Derek, you to read that because
really, it’s really dynamic. Dynamic is

01:09:57.920 --> 01:10:04.920
the word for that. You can blast all the Jungians
and all the psychologists together. I must

01:10:09.130 --> 01:10:15.250
find it out, otherwise somebody should write
to him that God knows where it is Mother is

01:10:15.250 --> 01:10:17.600
very anxious. I must publish that book.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:24.600
So now if you come out with sensible good
books authentic, worked out, you have to work

01:10:25.090 --> 01:10:32.090
for a book, you cannot just write anything
off hand. Like William Blake and Sahaja Yoga,

01:10:39.050 --> 01:10:46.050
relate it to Sahaja Yoga. Now before meditation
any questions, is there? Did you ask any questions

01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:59.200
there? No one? Any question? Yes, what is
it?

01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:14.270
[Yogi’s question is inaudible]

01:11:22.450 --> 01:11:23.960
Shri Mataji: Loud. It’s so fast that it’s
like Portuguese to Me. Can you tell Me Gavin?

01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:24.210
Yogi: He is saying there should be some organization
by which it’s known whether any particular

01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.360
one of Your speeches is being or has been
transcribed, so that there’s no duplication.

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:24.460
Shri Mataji: There’s no…?

01:11:24.210 --> 01:11:25.600
Yogi: Duplication of effort. Because he wants
for Your speeches to be transcribed from the

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:26.500
tapes and he doesn’t want to do one and
it’s already been transcribed.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:26.750
Shri Mataji: Are you doing some… you’re
transcribing.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.980
Yogi: Not at the moment Shri Mataji. I used
to worry – every time Shri Mataji has a

01:11:29.980 --> 01:11:36.020
very nice speech sometimes I just felt like
transcribing it but I was worried maybe someone

01:11:36.020 --> 01:11:37.540
is doing it already.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:39.050
Shri Mataji: What’s it…

01:11:39.050 --> 01:11:46.050
Yogi: He’s worried that if he does the transcript
somebody else may be doing the transcription

01:11:56.430 --> 01:12:03.430
so it would be a wasted effort.

01:12:11.310 --> 01:12:18.310
Shri Mataji: Agreed. Now who are transcribing
- they form a group. You are transcribing?

01:12:29.030 --> 01:12:36.030
Who else, will you stand up, you also stand
up please. Now you know each other don’t

01:12:40.460 --> 01:12:41.670
you?

01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:48.670
Yogi: Mother I’m quite prepared to take
a list because I’ve got a computer.

01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:51.200
Shri Mataji: What is it?

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:55.240
Yogi: He said he can make the list on his
computer. To make a list…

01:12:55.240 --> 01:13:01.580
Shri Mataji: Yes I think amongst these four
who are transcribing, all right. You decide

01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:02.860
among yourselves.

01:13:02.860 --> 01:13:09.860
Yogi: But there are many more internationally
Shri Mataji and it should be advised to all

01:13:16.610 --> 01:13:16.860
centers.

01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.430
Shri Mataji: You see in other languages, which
are being translated.

01:13:18.430 --> 01:13:19.040
Yogi: Even in English

01:13:19.040 --> 01:13:21.580
Shri Mataji: Like say Australia - whatever
I have said there in Australia they should

01:13:21.580 --> 01:13:28.140
transcribe. That what I have said in England
they should, in every country whatever I’ve

01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:35.140
said should be transcribed by that country,
is better to make it systematic. All right?

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:42.040
Is all right now? So four of you here should
transcribe whatever I’ve said in England,

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:49.040
which is going to be a hard task. Some more
people should raise their hands, who would

01:13:50.140 --> 01:13:57.140
like to do transcribing. Please stand up,
Derek and Louise, you take down their names,

01:14:02.970 --> 01:14:09.970
take down their names. You give your names,
write in on a chit of paper. And now you form

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:21.520
a group and tell them how to transcribe. What
else? First of all you must understand My

01:14:33.750 --> 01:14:39.890
Indian English, otherwise you can’t, or
they call it King’s English I don’t know

01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:43.250
why but they say so.

01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:45.620
Shri Mataji: Yes, how are you?

01:14:45.620 --> 01:14:47.290
Yogi: Getting better I hope Mother.

01:14:47.290 --> 01:14:54.290
Shri Mataji: That’s good you look better,
thank you. May God bless you. What is the

01:14:57.310 --> 01:15:04.310
next? It’s very, very constructive. Now
editing, once you have transcribed somebody

01:15:26.800 --> 01:15:33.420
has to edit it also. Not like Indians - whatever
when I speak I say sometimes, “You see,”

01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:38.440
“Do you understand?” All these things
need not be there but they think that nothing

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:43.770
should be missed of Mother. But I would say
that something is needed. I mean, you cannot

01:15:43.770 --> 01:15:50.770
go on just adding these things after all,
so we can remove some of these things, this

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:58.720
type of pauses that I’ve used. Because talking
is different from writing. But in any case

01:15:58.720 --> 01:16:05.720
when you do it I’ll have to go through them,
before we publish them. But so many lectures

01:16:10.460 --> 01:16:17.460
of Mine have duplicates, repetitions. So once
you have done, transcription then we can see

01:16:25.410 --> 01:16:32.410
that, we can adjust. Sometimes certain things
are to be said once, sometimes twice, and

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:40.920
sometimes hundred and eight times. For example,
“I am not guilty.”

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:51.800
All right, so any other thing? This was very
constructive I must say. Yes?

01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:53.560
Yogi: Mother in one of the Nirmala Yogas there’s
a little diagram which You have drawn of the

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.460
Kundalini coming up through the chakras and
going round two circles and then coming up

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:58.130
to the next one. I can’t find from it if
the Kundalini is coming up and going round

01:16:58.130 --> 01:17:05.130
and then continuing up the same side or if
it’s crossing over at each junction. Supposing

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:14.520
I am doing the right side, is it coming up
and going round and continuing up the right

01:17:18.080 --> 01:17:25.080
side every time, or does it come up the right
side, go round twice and go to the left, go

01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:32.170
round and come up.

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:39.170
Shri Mataji: No it goes in a spiral way and
cuts it at a point, and makes a chakra. You

01:17:40.140 --> 01:17:47.140
see it’s a sympathetic nervous system which
is left and right. It goes in a spiral, all

01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:53.750
right? And it cuts it at a point because it
goes in a spiral - that’s the chakra. But

01:17:53.750 --> 01:18:00.750
I think we have done that in one of the speeches,
is so. Once this is transcribed, that will

01:18:02.250 --> 01:18:07.190
be a source. Then everything I’ve said,
all these things, I’ve said it in very great

01:18:07.190 --> 01:18:14.190
details, you will have to locate it. What
else now? What is it? Yes, Gavin you tell

01:18:27.670 --> 01:18:27.920
Me?

01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:33.390
Yogi: What is to be done with the water that
is used in puja, afterwards? When we wash

01:18:33.390 --> 01:18:40.390
the Feet, what use is to be made of the water,
how is it to be dispersed? Say at home when

01:18:41.970 --> 01:18:48.970
we do a little puja and we just wash Your
Feet in the photograph, what’s the proper

01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:53.400
way to dispose of it?

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:59.080
Shri Mataji: The photograph or Feet? Photograph,
you see, that becomes vibrated water, you

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:06.080
can use for any purpose, you can put it for
trees, you can do all these things external

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:10.850
use, you can use for anything. But if you
have cleaned the photograph and all that and

01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:16.460
if it is a clean photograph then you can use
it for drinking also, is all right, can be

01:19:16.460 --> 01:19:23.000
used for drinking also. Because vibrations
are such that they kill all germs, everything.

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:27.460
Because now for Ganges water we just drink
like that, no problem. It never gets spoilt.

01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:33.620
You keep it for months together never gets
spoilt. Because falling from the head of Shiva

01:19:33.620 --> 01:19:38.610
never gets spoilt, that’s the sign of the
River Ganges.

01:19:38.610 --> 01:19:45.610
Yogi: He’s asking what is Your advice about
fasting?

01:19:49.530 --> 01:19:56.530
Shri Mataji: No, you can fast but not in the
name of God. If you want to fast you can fast

01:19:57.290 --> 01:20:01.370
but not in the name of God. God doesn’t
want you to fast. Nor does He want you to

01:20:01.370 --> 01:20:08.230
eat like a glutton but, He wants you to enjoy
the food, whatever He has given you. It should

01:20:08.230 --> 01:20:13.850
be: you should pray over the thing, you should
give vibrations to your food and enjoy. God

01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:19.470
has given you everything and you should eat
what is needed for you. But you should not

01:20:19.470 --> 01:20:22.890
starve, you should not fast in the name of
God. Don’t torture yourself in the name

01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:27.990
of God. That’s very anti-God activity, I
think. Like poor fellow yesterday that Vivekananda

01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:34.990
tortured him, imagine? He’s gone through
all that for four years, too much. It makes

01:20:36.670 --> 01:20:42.290
Me really very sad that people are tortured
in the name of God.

01:20:42.290 --> 01:20:49.290
Yogi: Should there be a magazine with all
the poems?

01:20:59.430 --> 01:21:00.890
Shri Mataji: Yes, we have a magazine?

01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:02.880
Yogi: He’s saying, “Could we have one?”

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:09.880
Shri Mataji: With the poems? Only thing I’ll
say, poems are to be very much still to be

01:21:11.310 --> 01:21:18.310
put right. Magazine for Sahaja Yogis is all
right, but if you have to put it out, then

01:21:20.110 --> 01:21:27.110
they have to be little bit, brought up-to-date,
I mean in the sense that they have to be more,

01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:35.920
sort of, edited, and one has to work on them.
And the poems should be brought out as magazines

01:21:40.580 --> 01:21:47.210
but they have to go through proper understanding
and things. Even sometimes people write funny,

01:21:47.210 --> 01:21:54.210
funny types of poems also, like somebody will
say, “Sahaja Yoga is my rice and Sahaja

01:21:54.720 --> 01:22:01.720
Yoga is my daal, and Sahaja Yoga is my meat
and Sahaja Yoga is my fish.” And I said,

01:22:03.930 --> 01:22:10.930
“Next will be and Mataji is my food.”
You see they mean that it is everything, but

01:22:12.920 --> 01:22:19.920
the way they express is sometimes really crude.
Yes, there was a poem like that I tell you,

01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:32.910
and I got a fright of My life you see.

01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:40.440
So, I would say that one has to be little
careful. You see there are two things always

01:22:46.240 --> 01:22:53.240
in expression. First is creativity. Of course,
you have to be a creative person but you must

01:22:57.200 --> 01:23:04.200
have the technique. If you don’t have the
technique, then this creativity looks bizarre.

01:23:12.730 --> 01:23:19.730
So even if you have ideas, very poetic ideas,
you must have the technique of putting it

01:23:22.720 --> 01:23:29.720
in. Prose poetry can be also very beautiful
but you must know the technique, you must

01:23:30.030 --> 01:23:37.030
know the way how to put it across. Like you
may be a great artist as a creative artist,

01:23:40.870 --> 01:23:47.870
but you must know how to put technically.
Supposing I am a great artist but I don’t

01:23:48.060 --> 01:23:54.290
know how to handle a brush, how will I do
it?

01:23:54.290 --> 01:23:58.420
So both things have to be there and that’s
what I think, that because of Sahaja Yoga

01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:02.290
people are getting very creative and they
are feeling the exuberance and they want to

01:24:02.290 --> 01:24:09.290
express themselves but the technique part
of it is lacking, and the subtleties are lacking.

01:24:11.060 --> 01:24:15.790
So whatever poems you are writing is very
good idea, like some of them are very good,

01:24:15.790 --> 01:24:22.790
but still I think there should not be any
crudeness in it, all right? So all those who

01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:30.620
are writing poems, who would like to write,
stand up. So nice to see so many poets around.

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:50.760
All right so now, who will look after? You?
All right. You all know them, give your names

01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:10.840
to him and send all your poems to him, all
right? That’s it. There should be nothing

01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:26.240
childish, cheapish or anything like that.
Then for art, all those who want to produce

01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:36.420
pictures and paintings, drawings, please stand
up, even the children. Chris, you’re going

01:25:57.760 --> 01:26:04.760
to do that, good, and your wife too, she’s
very good. So let’s have Chris there. Chris

01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:15.080
will you be in charge? Please be seated.

01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.210
So it comes to that we have also two types
of people. We have people who are intellectuals

01:26:27.210 --> 01:26:34.210
- easy chair Sahaja Yogis - as we have politicians.
They good at knowledge, scholarship. They

01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:43.360
know about Sahaja Yoga. They write well. But
there are others who are active, very active,

01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:52.420
the young, extremely active, they can work
hard, they can do anything. That’s a very

01:26:55.640 --> 01:27:02.640
good thing, but I think we should try to imbibe
one quality that is lacking in us. Like a

01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:19.640
person who is an intellectual, or a person
who is a scholar, should try to do other things

01:27:20.480 --> 01:27:27.480
also, like postering now. So for postering
they will not go, those who are intellectuals.

01:27:30.790 --> 01:27:37.790
That’s not good. Or anything like that.
Those who are painting, they’ll paint but

01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:42.750
not poster it, or they would not like to write
the addresses.

01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:48.620
We should be able to do everything because
we are integrated personalities. I mean I

01:27:48.620 --> 01:27:53.160
can give lectures, I can cook food and I can
wash utensils and I can clean My house. I

01:27:53.160 --> 01:27:58.370
can wash your clothes and whatever you say.
Perhaps may be something I may not be able

01:27:58.370 --> 01:28:05.370
to do I should say, many things. I tell you
so many things I can’t do. You don’t know

01:28:05.640 --> 01:28:12.640
My weaknesses, there are lots of things. I’m
very bad at signing checks, useless for banks.

01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:22.910
Always the banks put Me into trouble, I don’t
know what they’re up to, and thank God Gavin

01:28:23.080 --> 01:28:29.530
is quite aware of My weaknesses. So looks
after that part otherwise I would be sunk,

01:28:29.530 --> 01:28:36.530
bad at money. Very good at remembering if
somebody has taken money from Me, but if I

01:28:38.120 --> 01:28:44.800
have given something to someone I don’t
remember, very bad. I give something to someone

01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:50.080
and then I don’t remember I’ve given it
and I appreciate it, it’s very bad too.

01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:55.140
I do it very often. I’m so frightened now
I don’t want to praise anything because

01:28:55.140 --> 01:29:02.140
mostly it is given by Me - it’s horrid.
It looks very funny isn’t it?

01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:12.750
That’s one side missing completely in Me.
I’m very bad at say passports and things

01:29:14.710 --> 01:29:21.710
like that and … what? Also, I don’t know
about ticketing, all these things I’m very

01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:31.740
bad at all these things, you see. So that’s
how you look after Me in that part, is really

01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:37.500
I just don’t know. I’m very bad at time,
now I don’t know what’s the time now.

01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:44.500
Very bad at watch, it’s always upside down.
But there’s one thing good, that I know

01:29:51.620 --> 01:29:58.620
Myself very well, and I know how to laugh
at Myself, so I never feel guilty, I know

01:30:01.360 --> 01:30:08.360
how to laugh at Myself. I can’t learn now,
these things. I’ve learnt lots of human

01:30:08.620 --> 01:30:14.210
things but now I can’t learn how to sign
a check, where to sign, what to sign, I’m

01:30:14.210 --> 01:30:18.640
very bad. You can get signature on My death
warrant also. See I’m like that, I don’t

01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:24.580
know I just sign I trust and works out. So
far nothing has gone wrong as such, much,

01:30:24.580 --> 01:30:31.580
but this is what it is. So doesn’t matter,
one can manage. And that is how one should

01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:38.270
look at oneself - not to feel guilty but some
things are missing.

01:30:38.270 --> 01:30:45.270
But if you can acquire, other qualities also,
will be a good idea. And that’s what I think

01:30:49.610 --> 01:30:54.960
should be the attitude towards Sahaja Yoga,
that no work is below our dignity. For some

01:30:54.960 --> 01:31:00.110
people have such ego, “Oh I’m coming there
why not I have a room?” Such stupid people

01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:05.240
have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga, I tell
you. “I must have a special room, why shouldn’t

01:31:05.240 --> 01:31:12.240
I have this?” This is absolute sign of a
stupid fellow, is absolutely a sign of a person

01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:19.590
who has never known what is comfort, never
known what is money, never known what is luxury.

01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:29.310
Is something cheapish like a beggar who just
starts demanding, “Give me five shillings,”

01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:35.890
then he asks for one hundred shillings and
this and that. All these things - the one

01:31:35.890 --> 01:31:42.890
who asks for things, is not a king. The one
who accepts whatever comes their way is the

01:31:43.960 --> 01:31:50.960
real king because he’s mastered it. This
is what is the right attitude. That’s what

01:31:55.050 --> 01:32:02.050
a Sahaja Yogi has to be. Who goes on grudging,
grumbling about small, small things is not

01:32:02.620 --> 01:32:09.620
a Sahaja Yogi. Sahaja Yogi is a king, he gives,
gives Realization, the utmost, the highest,

01:32:57.620 --> 01:33:00.140
all right?

01:33:00.140 --> 01:33:07.140
What’s it? [Shri Mataji speaks with an Indian
yogini in Marathi - UNKNOWN MARATHI WORDS]

01:33:17.570 --> 01:33:24.510
She’s giving a very subtle point about puja.
That when we are doing the puja, say of the

01:33:24.510 --> 01:33:29.840
photograph also, then we should have all these
things like a kalasha and all those things

01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.920
there, we should not just do the puja of the
thing - pratibha. So I’ve said. “You’ve

01:33:34.920 --> 01:33:38.800
come here all the way over here to tell them
these things they don’t know.” So all

01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:43.580
you see the deepam and all these things should
be there properly done, for the photograph

01:33:43.580 --> 01:33:48.260
also, that’s in the protocol. So certain
things of protocol - now Gavin is becoming

01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:55.260
a big pundit you know. He’s getting a scholarship
in puja business. So you better talk to Gavin,

01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:56.480
those who have problems about puja, better
ask Gavin.

01:33:56.480 --> 01:34:02.150
Yogi: Mother I was going to ask those who
know something about Puja should come and

01:34:02.150 --> 01:34:03.900
tell me.

01:34:03.900 --> 01:34:09.500
Shri Mataji: All right some of you should…
they have to tell something you better go

01:34:09.500 --> 01:34:16.500
and tell him also. Yes, good idea. Chhaaya
has not come today? No. She has told lot,

01:34:18.450 --> 01:34:24.610
then we have got… now she has come. Shakuntala
is here then we have got this lady, we have

01:34:24.610 --> 01:34:31.610
so many who can tell you about this and you
can work it out. That’s good. So scholarship

01:34:33.010 --> 01:34:40.010
of puja that should be, and those who want
to do puja now, stand up. That’s too much.

01:34:46.650 --> 01:34:53.650
To know about puja, all right? Good idea.
You ask Gavin, we should really have about

01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:01.590
different marriages, how we perform, what
are the mantras, what does it mean. All those

01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:08.420
things I think we should really compile a
book on that, good idea. All of you should

01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:14.570
support. Give your ideas, all right. Thank
you. I mean in the sense you ask a question,

01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:19.880
“What should be done? What is to be done?
What is good?” So that he works on that

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:26.880
and we find out a common point. All right.
May God bless you. Sit down, sit down. Any

01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.280
other aspect. Yes?

01:35:32.280 --> 01:35:39.280
Yogi: Shri Mataji, I was wondering what was
going to happening about building work in

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:43.380
Sahaja Yoga, sometime ago we discussed Golden
Builders.

01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:50.380
Shri Mataji: You have, you are a registered
society, aren’t you? Have you registered

01:35:52.420 --> 01:35:59.420
yourself as Golden Builders? All right, all
those who are interested in buildings and

01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:09.710
decoration and maintenance, please stand up.
Vicky, what do you build?

01:36:09.710 --> 01:36:16.710
Yogi: Mother, the decoration side, if that’s
suitable and can be integrated into the building,

01:36:18.930 --> 01:36:23.000
the decoration side…

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:30.000
Shri Mataji: Really, then better give your
names to Vicky, all of you. Let’s have it

01:36:34.710 --> 01:36:40.700
because, you see, also I tell you John, I
gave him a good advice to John. I told him,

01:36:40.700 --> 01:36:46.240
“Take photographs of My house and use it
for advertising for saying that this is the

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:50.990
house we have done. This is what we have done.”
For example, you can do it by showing your

01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:57.990
film the way that I have taken the photograph.
I mean I have done this, all that you see,

01:36:58.460 --> 01:37:05.460
and can use it as an advertising thing. So
that’s how you can carry album and say that

01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:10.800
we are working with Golden Builders.

01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:17.800
Yogi: One other area Shri Mataji, music.

01:37:20.940 --> 01:37:27.940
Shri Mataji: All right. For music please stand
up. We don’t have Banam here. Is he here?

01:37:42.000 --> 01:37:45.910
Yogi: Yes, Mother.

01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:52.910
Shri Mataji: All right. Because I have already
asked him to do one thing. So will you look

01:37:56.570 --> 01:38:03.570
after, all right? Can you all contact him?
Whatever is to be done about music, all right?

01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:23.800
Please be seated. Now there’s one another
aspect is photography. Photos, is should not

01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:36.790
be all filed. Remember what we have done.
Gavin you have to get all the names of the

01:38:36.790 --> 01:38:41.120
people who have… you should give to your
leaders all right all of you. Whatever you

01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:48.120
have said it, without hesitation I would like
to see. Now photography – those who take

01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:55.780
photographs stand up. No, more. More people
for photographs. Many more. Those who have…what

01:39:13.170 --> 01:39:14.290
are you saying?

01:39:14.290 --> 01:39:20.330
Yogi: Those who have taken nice photographs
of Mother, I thought they would stand up.

01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:27.330
Shri Mataji: Some of them? All right. Where
is Don?

01:39:32.390 --> 01:39:39.390
Yogi: He is making tea, Shri Mataji.

01:39:41.830 --> 01:39:46.030
Shri Mataji: He is making what?

01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.280
Yogi: Tea.

01:39:46.090 --> 01:39:53.090
Shri Mataji: So, all right. So Don … Harris
will look after that. Ray. You all should

01:39:54.200 --> 01:40:01.200
contact Ray. Give him your names. All right?

01:40:09.440 --> 01:40:16.440
Legal side is very important. So lawyers and
administrators, just stand up. No we have

01:40:27.150 --> 01:40:34.150
here, what about you? You are a Custom Officer
isn’t it? Better stand up. Anybody police

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:45.140
officer, those who are dealing with government?
Yes, good. All right, you look after that.

01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.700
Good. You know him or not? All right.

01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.700
Yogi: Mother may I ask you one thing about
the important side of perhaps purchasing property

01:40:59.450 --> 01:41:01.400
through Sahaja Yoga and maybe the benefits
that could be obtained through use of the

01:41:01.400 --> 01:41:04.630
charity. We don’t have any knowledge about
it at the moment, but in Birmingham at the

01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:04.880
moment, we have made some inquiries and now
Ray from Derby, he deals with the legal side

01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:04.880
of many things connected with local government…

01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:04.880
Shri Mataji: Can you stand up.

01:41:04.630 --> 01:41:06.330
Yogi: …and he’s been most helpful in sorting
out our details referring to mortgages and

01:41:06.330 --> 01:41:13.330
so on for us and has come up with certain
information. But also we’re anxious to know

01:41:37.070 --> 01:41:41.060
what benefits may be accrued by Sahaja Yogis
if we can use a charity to do such things.

01:41:41.060 --> 01:41:48.060
It seems that there may be some financial
benefits here and if we can get together some

01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:01.610
information.

01:42:01.610 --> 01:42:08.610
Shri Mataji: All right. For this part I would
say David Prall. Where is he? Stand up. Those

01:42:10.440 --> 01:42:17.320
who are interested, buying properties and
charitable things and all that, who are interested?

01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:24.320
Just get up. Where is Ian?

01:42:26.400 --> 01:42:33.400
Yogi: Mother we have got some details about
the covenant thing from our accountant…

01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:43.050
Shri Mataji: What, details about?

01:42:43.050 --> 01:42:45.840
Yogi: Getting money on covenant. It’s very
much beneficial, tax benefits…

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:50.280
Shri Mataji: All right. So David Prall is
to be informed about whatever information

01:42:50.280 --> 01:42:57.280
you get, and to get from him all the information
that is needed, and through him we’ll deal

01:43:01.130 --> 01:43:07.920
in property problems. All right? So let us
have a collective thing, all of you should

01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:14.670
give your names to him, and everyone who is
now appointed as the person in charge should

01:43:14.670 --> 01:43:21.670
give us a full idea. Any problem with your
properties should go to this committee. All

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:24.260
right?

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:31.260
Now, there’s one more aspect which is the
most important and the greatest headache,

01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:42.760
is marriages. So this has to be somebody international
and…You are in that photograph group, all

01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:09.030
right? Who is in charge of photographs, Ray
Harris. All right? You contact him. Now make

01:44:09.690 --> 01:44:16.210
something positive, some plans positive, make
it something, let Me know. There are photographs

01:44:16.210 --> 01:44:20.980
and photographs and you don’t know where
they are compiled, who has taken them, where

01:44:20.980 --> 01:44:27.980
are the copies – nothing. It’s all just,
everywhere, all right? So proper filing has

01:44:28.140 --> 01:44:35.140
to be done, proper understanding has to be
done. For marriages Warren is the best I think.

01:44:54.300 --> 01:45:01.300
Now Warren you should stand up and now those
who want to help in making marriages successful,

01:45:03.360 --> 01:45:09.670
in the sense in advising people, in making
them understand, talking to them, and also

01:45:09.670 --> 01:45:16.670
organizing marriages, future marriages, of
people – like a marriage bureau – those

01:45:17.680 --> 01:45:23.580
who would like to help. Some elderly people
should come out for this. I would like to

01:45:23.580 --> 01:45:30.580
have. What do you think Manta? You not stood
for anything, come along. Pat, where’s Pat?

01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:43.820
Who else? They should be happily married people,
in a way. Yes, good, Sarah. Yes, good. There

01:45:55.830 --> 01:46:00.670
are outside also. That’s for children. They
will be for children. Those who are outside

01:46:00.670 --> 01:46:02.260
will be for children.

01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:09.260
All right, so here they are, now please send
your names to him today. All these names must

01:46:12.250 --> 01:46:19.250
be given today, in this seminar, all right?
Now for children, last and the most important.

01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:31.920
Call them. You are a teacher, isn’t it?
You are teaching in a school. But just now

01:46:50.710 --> 01:46:57.710
we are thinking of starting a school in Hounslow.
But where do you live? It’s too far away.

01:47:07.400 --> 01:47:14.400
All right. Now how many of you who have children,
small children, and interested in them? Let’s

01:47:22.530 --> 01:47:29.530
see. Now get up. All those parents who have
small children, all those parents who have

01:47:30.970 --> 01:47:37.970
very small children. Get him please, get him.
I think David is the best for this. David

01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:06.940
will you take over? Let David handle. All
of you should contact David about it. Now

01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:18.030
all of you should sit down and only David
should stand so they should know.

01:48:19.260 --> 01:48:26.260
You’ll have to also deal with problem children.
There are problem children. Now we have to

01:48:29.920 --> 01:48:36.920
find out something where we can deal with
problem children. And about that I’ll talk

01:48:40.890 --> 01:48:47.890
to you. Those who have problem children, please
get up. She’s better, much better now. But

01:48:55.670 --> 01:48:57.120
what about you?

01:48:57.120 --> 01:49:04.090
[Question from a yogi: is deafness a problem?]

01:49:04.090 --> 01:49:11.090
In a way, in a way it is, because it is to
be treated, all right? So, those who have

01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:20.240
problem children, also must be dealt with.
So you can have two things: where there are

01:49:20.690 --> 01:49:25.790
problem children and where there are not.
If they are catching, if they are still not

01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:32.790
enjoying life, if they have little problems
with them, or if they are catching from parents,

01:49:32.890 --> 01:49:37.790
all these things are to be dealt with.

01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:44.790
So on this point I have to say one thing,
when we have problem children is sometimes

01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:52.900
the fault of the parents also or may be some
defect in them, or some sort of a wrong thing.

01:49:52.900 --> 01:49:59.900
Now under these circumstances, we have to
understand that it is the right approach of

01:50:00.510 --> 01:50:05.740
the parents can only help the children to
get all right. So whatever is suggested to

01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:10.970
them and told to them, they are not to feel
bad about it, but to accept it and correct

01:50:10.970 --> 01:50:15.390
their ways and methods and things will work
out. All right, so that’s a promise. Nobody’s

01:50:15.390 --> 01:50:21.460
going to feel bad about it. Is going to take
it up as a very good advice, whatever we have

01:50:21.460 --> 01:50:26.720
to tell them, so because we have to pay special
attention to this. Specially with ladies I

01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:32.000
have seen if you tell them anything, they
start crying. It’s a water power which I

01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:39.000
cannot overcome. I don’t cry so much do
I? I don’t know why people should cry so

01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:48.870
much and upset everybody. So such people will
not be allowed to cry. If they are to correct

01:50:48.870 --> 01:50:54.610
their children, first thing they are not to
cry and weep and sulk. Then only we can solve

01:50:54.610 --> 01:51:01.610
the problem, all right? So, done. This is
also done. All right, let the children go

01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:09.390
out. Because the children still are not peaceful.
We can see that. They are very noisy. They

01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:16.680
are not normal, so you can take the children
out. I think most of them are problem children,

01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:25.720
because they cannot feel the vibrations.

01:51:34.380 --> 01:51:41.380
You could feel, you see. Did you feel that
when they came in, the heaviness? It was very

01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:48.600
sad. Those who were supposed to do great jobs
are sick now. That’s because of the parents.

01:52:02.190 --> 01:52:09.190
I think now I can go or what’s the next
program?

01:52:12.590 --> 01:52:19.590
Yogi: Mother this evening we wanted to sing
something for You, some books.

01:52:35.450 --> 01:52:42.450
Shri Mataji: What’s that? Can you hand it
over to Me. What a very sweet thing you…what

01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:57.520
a sweet thing. Thank you. Lunch? I don’t
know. Am I supposed to eat lunch? That’s

01:52:57.520 --> 01:53:04.520
another thing you see. I have not had lunch
so far, I think so, you know. So what song

01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:19.920
Gavin? Why not have I’m Your Rakhi Brother?

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:40.120
Yogi: There’s quite a big job to be done
on taping…big job to be done on getting

01:53:51.620 --> 01:53:58.620
all Your tapes transferred onto permanent
tapes. Did You want to appoint somebody to

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.290
help Germail with that?

01:54:01.290 --> 01:54:06.040
Shri Mataji: Where is Germail? I didn’t
see him.

01:54:06.040 --> 01:54:13.040
Yogi: He’s coming in the afternoon. We need
people who are technically well who are able

01:54:14.220 --> 01:54:17.900
to spare time each week to copy many of Your
old tapes.

01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:24.900
Shri Mataji: Those who want to copy My old
tapes and help, please stand up who know technical

01:54:31.940 --> 01:54:38.940
ways of doing it. But we have only one machine.
Can we buy another?

01:54:51.310 --> 01:54:57.690
Yogi: The machinery is adequate, Mother. They’ve
got enough machinery now.

01:54:57.690 --> 01:54:59.050
Shri Mataji: Only one.

01:54:59.050 --> 01:55:03.520
Yogi: Germail is well set up for copying.
It’s the people we need.

01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:07.890
Shri Mataji: You have to come, distribute
among yourselves and [MARATHI] and there’s

01:55:07.890 --> 01:55:14.680
no Hindi speaking people here? Chhaya can
do Hindi. They can go there to the ashram

01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:21.680
and do it. [MARATHI] So Ian is not going to
be here permanently but Germail. You must

01:55:25.530 --> 01:55:31.360
contact Germail, offer your services to him
and tell him that you would like to do that.

01:55:31.360 --> 01:55:36.570
How many there are, who can spare? Derek you
got up also. Can you come to the ashram sometimes?

01:55:36.570 --> 01:55:43.570
Yogi: I’ve got copying facilities in Cambridge,
Mother. They send me single tapes and I copy

01:55:45.860 --> 01:55:49.340
twenty or forty at a time.

01:55:49.340 --> 01:55:52.550
Shri Mataji: All right. Some people who can
spare a day.

01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:59.550
Yogi: One day each week. Come on, there should
be a lot of people who can do it, in London,

01:56:02.380 --> 01:56:05.200
at Chelsham Road.

01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:12.200
Shri Mataji: Will you give your names to Germail?
Some more people should come round. It’s

01:56:12.340 --> 01:56:13.230
a tremendous task, you see.

01:56:13.230 --> 01:56:14.640
Yogi: All go back to 1974. They are all deteriorating
and Mother’s tapes are going to be lost

01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:20.030
if we don’t do it quickly. We also need
to spend money on a digital recorder to make

01:56:20.030 --> 01:56:21.730
it permanent.

01:56:21.730 --> 01:56:28.730
Shri Mataji: That’s good. It’s very important.
Children are in a bad shape Left Nahbi is

01:56:51.090 --> 01:56:58.090
catching. Wrong with, something wrong with
the mothers. What is it? Now what I’m saying,

01:57:08.050 --> 01:57:12.170
this is to be done when I am gone, all of
you, should give your names to…remember,

01:57:12.170 --> 01:57:16.650
I hope you remember. Because you stood up
and sat down, stood up and sat down, but now

01:57:16.650 --> 01:57:22.060
remember when you stood up, you see. One may
forget.

01:57:22.060 --> 01:57:29.060
Yogi: He’s saying that there must be some
people who would be prepared to write articles

01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:39.180
about Sahaja Yoga for publication in the magazines
and newspapers, and we should make an effort

01:57:49.570 --> 01:57:52.360
on that line.

01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:57.310
Shri Mataji: Yes. That’s one side of it.
Newspaper cuttings and things now, I was thinking

01:57:57.310 --> 01:58:03.660
of John Noyce if he’s here, I don’t know.
Are you? He’s the one who should be in charge

01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:08.660
of that, John Noyce. Will you stand up? Now
will you stand up all those who want to do

01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:15.660
that? Is compiling of all newspaper cuttings,
from all over the world, compiling all articles

01:58:20.880 --> 01:58:27.880
which are to be published. You mean to say
in the magazines? What did he say?

01:58:40.980 --> 01:58:47.980
Yogi: He’s saying that people should start
writing now, for publication and that it should

01:58:50.170 --> 01:58:50.420
all be edited and sent in.

01:58:50.310 --> 01:58:55.190
Shri Mataji: Yes. That’s it. But also we
have newspaper cuttings everywhere which are

01:58:55.190 --> 01:58:58.900
to be put into one file and to be studied
and marked.

01:58:58.900 --> 01:59:05.900
Yogi: That’s one job which is very good
for John to do. He’s very good at that.

01:59:06.510 --> 01:59:08.750
Another team with David perhaps.

01:59:08.750 --> 01:59:14.470
Shri Mataji: Now. For David is for property
and all that we’ve given him one job, is

01:59:14.470 --> 01:59:19.610
sufficient to kill him with one job. But you
can join him in this, I mean in the sense

01:59:19.610 --> 01:59:25.710
you can belong to that party as well. So now
those who want to compile all that is interviewed,

01:59:25.710 --> 01:59:32.710
all the newspapers, every cutting and also
your own contributions, please stand up. This

01:59:33.440 --> 01:59:40.440
is not only writing, but compiling. That’s
good. Valerie is good. For example also we

01:59:42.420 --> 01:59:49.420
can say what we can do, how to have our pamphlets
and brochures and these are to be done up

01:59:54.210 --> 02:00:01.210
to that point. All right? That’s one. So
we come to another very delicate thing is

02:00:01.360 --> 02:00:08.360
contacts. Now so? That’s it. Contacts with
the television, and other publicity things.

02:00:15.170 --> 02:00:22.170
Now whatever is our own publicity should be
done by John Noyce but to contact others and

02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:23.610
all that. Valerie?

02:00:23.610 --> 02:00:26.600
Yogi: What about John Glover, Mother?

02:00:26.600 --> 02:00:33.600
Shri Mataji: Oh, where is John Glover? No
that’s for something else. But I was thinking

02:00:36.670 --> 02:00:42.690
Valerie is better for this. Will you take
over? Please stand up. Now those who want

02:00:42.690 --> 02:00:49.690
to go to the programs, if we arrange some
sort of a drama, something or we arrange anything

02:00:51.770 --> 02:00:58.770
related to the - for the television or publicity
anywhere else outside, through other agencies,

02:01:02.870 --> 02:01:09.870
please stand up. Good. Bogdan and John Noyce.
I didn’t see Bogdan, where is he? All right.

02:01:24.710 --> 02:01:31.710
So you be one of the parties with them, but
leader is Valerie. All right? Please be seated.

02:01:37.870 --> 02:01:44.870
But remember that you have promised all these
things in My presence. Practically we have

02:01:46.510 --> 02:01:53.510
covered lots of things. Let’s see how much
we achieve. So Paul what are you in charge?

02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:54.530
Computerization of everything.

02:01:54.530 --> 02:01:56.430
Yogi: Not at the moment, Mother.

02:01:56.430 --> 02:02:01.940
Shri Mataji: All right. You stand up for that.
Now here is Paul.

02:02:01.940 --> 02:02:07.390
Yogi: I’m pleased to say, Mother, that the
equipment we make is selling very well in

02:02:07.390 --> 02:02:14.390
India. We’re selling Marathi, Gujrati, Bengali,
Tamil systems, everything.

02:02:17.710 --> 02:02:24.710
Shri Mataji: So all that sort of typing, of
computerizing, Paul is in charge. Now those

02:02:28.110 --> 02:02:30.320
who want to help him in that, who are good
at computerizing, giving ideas on that please

02:02:30.320 --> 02:02:31.680
stand up. All right. Who else? Germail, also
Germail. Good. So now please write down all

02:02:31.680 --> 02:02:38.680
their names in one paper.

02:02:50.530 --> 02:02:57.530
That you can tell later. All right? Brian
has done a good job. There’s a series of

02:02:59.130 --> 02:03:06.130
seekers and actually in one of the programs
one boy gets Realization in front of My photograph

02:03:09.280 --> 02:03:16.280
and they show My photograph on the television.
But that is in Auckland. That is in New Zealand

02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:36.880
where we have a very great dynamic Prime Minister.
I think after Sadat, I feel he is another

02:03:37.700 --> 02:03:44.410
person who is a Realized soul. I hope the
Prime Minister here also gets Realization

02:03:44.410 --> 02:03:51.410
or we get somebody who is a Realized soul,
one of the two. I hope she gets it. Pray for

02:04:00.570 --> 02:04:07.570
it. So can we go now? What’s the lunchtime
business?

02:04:11.150 --> 02:04:18.150
Yogi: Lunch is coming, Shri Mataji.

02:04:18.390 --> 02:04:24.130
Shri Mataji: Here? And nobody’s going to
eat now. I’m the only person who is going

02:04:24.130 --> 02:04:24.610
to eat?

02:04:24.610 --> 02:04:25.930
[Yogi says something inaudible]

02:04:25.930 --> 02:04:31.000
Shri Mataji: All of us. Then it’s all right.
What’s that Gavin?

02:04:31.000 --> 02:04:37.950
[Yogi says something inaudible]

02:04:37.950 --> 02:04:44.900
Shri Mataji: Just … [laughter]

02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:51.900
Thank you very much. That’s quite heavy.
All right. May God bless you. You can open

02:05:08.450 --> 02:05:14.530
it and show them. That’s what they make
here, and I mean there was no need but they

02:05:14.530 --> 02:05:21.480
said I have to remember. I would in any case
remember and but now that’s their idea,

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:28.480
what am I to do? Something that they make
here. That’s it. See. Oh what a beautiful

02:06:11.820 --> 02:06:18.820
design. Is in Sheffield?

02:06:27.760 --> 02:06:29.360
Yogi: Yes, made in Sheffield.

02:06:29.360 --> 02:06:36.360
Shri Mataji: It’s beautiful design, isn’t
it? It’s better than what you showed Me.

02:06:38.070 --> 02:06:45.070
That’s the third one. Now we put it here.
It’s beautiful and this I will see every

02:06:46.170 --> 02:06:53.170
day, morning. It’s beautiful. Very beautiful
design I must say. You know we copied this

02:06:54.670 --> 02:07:01.670
in the… we have got this design, we use
it in Calcutta. Really. Believe Me. It’s

02:07:14.190 --> 02:07:21.190
beautiful. What a beauty. Four pieces you
got. It’s beautiful. Look at that. [applause]

02:07:39.050 --> 02:07:46.050
Thank you very much. Thank you. I thank all
the Sheffield Sahaja Yogis for such a beautiful

02:07:51.550 --> 02:07:58.550
gift and this I will have every day. Thank
you very much. May God bless you. You better

02:08:00.990 --> 02:08:05.380
keep it back into the box I think, properly
done. It’s beautiful, isn’t it? You all

02:08:05.380 --> 02:08:12.160
can have a look. Let them see. The design
is very nice and delicate. Who’s got it?

02:08:12.160 --> 02:08:13.720
Warren, you did.

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:18.370
Yogi: I got it with [INAUDIBLE] this morning.

02:08:18.370 --> 02:08:25.370
Shri Mataji: Really? No this I didn’t see.
The one I saw was, it has that design you

02:08:27.700 --> 02:08:31.010
know. That didn’t have any design.

02:08:31.010 --> 02:08:38.010
Yogi: They couldn’t get the one You wanted
so this is the replacement. This is cheaper.

02:08:56.500 --> 02:09:03.500
Shri Mataji: Really. Sahaj. It’s from the
same shop. It’s such a beautiful thing.

02:09:04.310 --> 02:09:10.280
And also very sensibly-sized you see. That
one was a jumbo one. All right. So should

02:09:10.280 --> 02:09:17.280
we have some music? And, Gavin if you want
I’ll eat, otherwise I better go. I don’t

02:09:19.460 --> 02:09:26.460
want to trouble you people because I had a
meal. No because … why to bother. All right.

02:09:29.970 --> 02:09:36.970
So, let’s have this one. But

02:09:50.790 --> 02:09:57.790
what a nice thing. I want to see the design.

02:09:59.110 --> 02:10:06.110
[TAPE CONTINUES WITH CONVERSATION AND SINGING
THEN:]

02:10:26.050 --> 02:10:33.050
Shri Mataji: Beautiful. Now, your suggestion.
Can

02:11:51.140 --> 02:11:58.140
you bring it? All right. Will you please go
and get it? Yes, yes that’s great. Just

02:13:56.500 --> 02:14:03.500
go. Those who have their instruments should
go and get it. Pat has come I think. He is

02:14:25.210 --> 02:14:32.210
sitting outside. What’s the matter? What
are you doing there? Well, you better join

02:14:36.130 --> 02:14:43.130
our company. Take him in the builders. [Marathi]
Please get your musical instruments if they

02:15:22.650 --> 02:15:29.650
are outside.

02:15:33.800 --> 02:15:40.800
The faces of Sahaja Yogis are so different
you know. They look so different. Every one

02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:51.340
is a piece of art I think. So beautiful. What’s
she saying?

02:15:56.670 --> 02:16:03.670
Yogi: There’s a new song written by Diane
from Sheffield.

02:16:06.400 --> 02:16:13.400
Shri Mataji: Really? Great. Let’s hear.
Now bring it along. Yes why not? From Sheffield

02:16:14.590 --> 02:16:21.590
we should have. [MARATHI] She’s written
a Marathi poem, so I’ll translate it to

02:16:44.389 --> 02:16:51.389
you. She says that, “My child who is a Sahaja
Yogi is telling you, is manifesting knowledge.

02:17:14.760 --> 02:17:21.760
I request you, everyone, that’s Me, request
you all of you, that I am the mother of this

02:17:24.969 --> 02:17:30.319
child, and you pay attention to him.”

02:17:30.319 --> 02:17:37.319
This is a typical, you see, a Indian, what
we call a kautuk, is the one where you handle

02:17:41.540 --> 02:17:48.540
the child with fondness. You express the fondness
for the child. Now so she’s describing the

02:17:51.510 --> 02:17:58.510
fondness for the child, I have. My little
child sonu they call it, is the golden child.

02:18:00.849 --> 02:18:07.849
My golden child speaks with such affection,
sweet, what you say to the child’s talk

02:18:23.189 --> 02:18:30.189
– chattel? Is it a good word? I mean Sahaja
Yogis having chattels. We can say the beautiful

02:18:36.250 --> 02:18:43.250
talk of a child. You see child here meaning
the innocence. He speaks to you with innocence,

02:18:45.229 --> 02:18:52.229
and listening to him, I’m saying, to the
people, listening to him, your attention will

02:18:53.779 --> 02:19:00.300
enter inside. It will leave all that is outside
and will enter inside.

02:19:00.300 --> 02:19:07.300
And
to tell [MARATHI] Nirupan is the explanation
of the Divine, but is said, it goes with My

02:19:16.330 --> 02:19:23.330
word Niru, Niru is My name. So it’s a pun
on the word Nirupan – pana means the abstract

02:19:26.399 --> 02:19:33.399
of Niru. To talk about that. So there’s
a word, Nirupan has double word. It also means

02:19:34.929 --> 02:19:41.929
to explain the abstract of Mother, and Nirupana
also means explanation of Divine. “Oh God,

02:19:48.760 --> 02:19:55.760
give him the blessings, I say. He is also
in this world living like a ordinary householder,

02:20:01.130 --> 02:20:08.130
as well as he has achieved a Sahaja samadhi.
He has achieved the Sahaja, samadhi as you

02:20:13.359 --> 02:20:20.359
know is the enlightened awareness. But he
lives in the world, not given up anything.

02:20:21.369 --> 02:20:28.369
For the people who are ignorant, he has taken
the help of chaitanya. He is [MARATHI] It

02:20:49.199 --> 02:20:56.199
goes beyond English. [MARATHI] Let Me try.

02:20:56.489 --> 02:21:03.489
You

02:21:07.430 --> 02:21:14.430
see you go on conquering, one after another
challenge to the ambrosia of Mother’s talks.

02:21:18.140 --> 02:21:25.140
Take Her name and you can do it. It’s very
poetic. [MARATHI] In the eyes there’s light,

02:21:36.380 --> 02:21:43.380
enlightened, and with that all the lights
get enlightened, and the Siddhapurushas, the

02:21:58.470 --> 02:22:05.470
ones who have achieved the Siddhata, the ones
who are very great, higher souls have come

02:22:08.470 --> 02:22:15.470
on this Earth now to see Mahayoga. They are
watching. Their spirits are watching this

02:22:15.489 --> 02:22:22.489
Mahayoga of the children, of children that
are Mine. All right? It’s about. I am not

02:22:25.479 --> 02:22:30.170
so good now I must say. We’ll have to sit
down. But Marathi language is very, very deep.

02:22:30.170 --> 02:22:37.170
To bring it out is very difficult but I have
tried. [MARATHI] Just put it for her little

02:22:51.239 --> 02:22:58.239
bit. [MARATHI - Poet sings in Marathi.]

02:23:14.029 --> 02:23:21.029
Shri Mataji: Now the last bit I just missed
the point. [MARATHI] the eyes lit in eyes

02:24:26.130 --> 02:24:33.130
of my children, they’re the eyes you see,
there’s a twinkle in your eye. The light

02:25:38.270 --> 02:25:45.270
lit in your eyes is that of knowledge, and
when it illumines the [MARATHI] What are they

02:26:04.579 --> 02:26:11.579
called? What are called clusters of lights
in the Heavens? What do you call them? Constellations?

02:26:15.670 --> 02:26:22.670
Yes, yes, constellations, yes. And when these
lights are enlightened the constellations,

02:26:24.609 --> 02:26:31.609
as the great evolved souls have come on this
earth as constellations because the twinkle

02:26:35.560 --> 02:26:40.619
in the eyes they see and all of them have
come on this Earth to see the Mahayoga that

02:26:40.619 --> 02:26:47.619
is working through

02:28:24.680 --> 02:28:31.680
you people. That’s a good one. Very beautiful.
Thank-you. [Applause]

02:28:55.460 --> 02:29:02.460
You read it from there, on the…that’s
better.

02:29:28.729 --> 02:29:35.729
Yogi: This song’s been written originally
by me but I had a lot of help from brother

02:29:53.659 --> 02:30:00.659
Sahaja Yogis in Sheffield and I need Gareth
Reynolds on the guitar. [Yogini sings You

02:30:11.140 --> 02:30:18.140
are the

02:30:29.960 --> 02:30:30.609
Ocean.]

02:30:30.609 --> 02:30:37.609
Shri Mataji: Well done. [Applause] It’s
a good one. Very beautiful. Very good one.

02:30:51.170 --> 02:30:58.170
Very well composed and very well done
and it’s really, I must say, also musically
it’s very well composed. May God bless you.

02:32:01.590 --> 02:32:08.590
Beautiful. That’s the quality. It’s beautiful.
That is Sheffield. [Applause] Are you going

02:32:24.659 --> 02:32:31.260
to sing? You’d better go and eat, and if
you want I can eat also. It’s all right.

02:32:31.260 --> 02:32:37.569
So then music comes to a termination. I’m
sorry, because they have to eat and I have

02:32:37.569 --> 02:32:43.590
to go back to London. Hope to meet you again
sometime, I hope so before I go to India,

02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:50.590
I don’t know what is the thing but Gavin
is trying to arrange a big program somewhere,

02:32:52.850 --> 02:32:59.850
again, hoping that in London we’ll do better
and some people will have some sticking plasters

02:33:02.109 --> 02:33:09.109
with them. So let’s eat. May God bless you.

02:33:11.039 --> 02:33:16.449
What a thing you’ve found I must say. That
company is the same as the one we saw is it?

02:33:16.449 --> 02:33:16.739
Same style, is it the same style? Similar.
Ah. But they had no guarantee, nothing and

02:33:16.739 --> 02:33:23.739
no design. This has guarantee? It has. For
how many years?
