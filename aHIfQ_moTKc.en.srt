1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:05,040
I had to spend a little more time than normal

2
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:07,640
to get to the stage

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:11,480
where we could really worship

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,360
the Guru.

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:24,920
When we worship our Guru,

6
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:28,720
we have to know actually

7
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,400
we are trying to awaken

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:36,040
the Guru Principle within ourselves.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:42,960
It's not only that you are here to worship your Guru.

10
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:46,960
You may worship

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,800
many-a-times,

12
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,720
maybe the vibrations would flow,

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,000
Maybe that you might get filled with that

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:04,480
and you feel

15
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,680
elevated, nourished.

16
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,520
But this nourishment

17
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,040
has to be retained within ourselves,

18
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,280
So always remember then,

19
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:29,680
whenever you are worshipping

20
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,960
any principle

21
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:37,760
outside, you are trying

22
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:43,800
to worship your own principle within yourself.

23
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,720
Within us as you know, in all of us

24
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:58,000
there lies the principle of Guru.

25
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,680
It's very interesting to notice

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,840
the Guru Principle being drawn

27
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,320
beautifully round the Nabhi Chakra.

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,200
We never see any chakras connected with the Guru Principle.

29
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,040
You see Nabhi, and around is the Bhavasagara.

30
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:38,160
So this Bhavasagara

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,160
which is the Ocean of Illusion cannot be the Guru.

32
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:51,080
So there are

33
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,280
hidden chakras within this Bhavasagara

34
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:02,560
within us, which are

35
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:06,520
to be awakened

36
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,920
and to be brought to light,

37
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,720
to be manifested.

38
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:23,080
As you can see that

39
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,600
the limits of this principle

40
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,960
are done by the movement

41
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:38,160
of the Swadisthana Chakra.

42
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,640
Swadisthan is the chakra

43
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:47,720
which gives you, first and foremost thing, is

44
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,000
the creativity.

45
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,040
A person who is a guru

46
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,200
has to be creative by nature.

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,760
If you are not a creative person

48
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:12,360
you cannot become a guru.

49
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,640
For example,

50
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:25,520
you are faced with disciples

51
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,920
with whom you have to converse.

52
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:35,640
You have to create

53
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,840
a word of divine magic

54
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:46,760
to impress on the disciples

55
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:51,880
or the people who are attracted towards you as gurus,

56
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,840
to show that

57
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:04,240
you have much more divine magic than them.

58
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:10,360
If you are a very mundane type of a person,

59
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,720
very ordinary,

60
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,520
cannot create

61
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,200
a beautiful couple or a beautiful sentence,

62
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:28,600
or a humor or a joke,

63
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,800
or a beautiful painting

64
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,520
or a beautiful tapestry

65
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,560
or a beautiful house;

66
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:47,960
if you lack in creativity

67
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,880
you will lack in your Guru Principle,

68
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,040
because a guru has to create

69
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,920
out of ordinary people

70
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:05,440
something extraordinary.

71
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:11,400
He should be able to create

72
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:16,360
a new personality out of

73
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,240
an old

74
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:30,280
personality which is decaying.

75
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,120
So the first principle

76
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:39,480
you have to understand within yourself,

77
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,920
that you should be able to create

78
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,680
a new personality in a person.

79
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,280
So how do we do it?

80
00:06:55,480 --> 00:07:00,400
Of course you have got powers to raise the Kundalini,

81
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:06,800
you have got powers to cure people,

82
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:12,360
you have got powers to talk big or talk small.

83
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,480
Despite all that,

84
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,960
if you cannot create a new personality

85
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,680
out of the persons with whom you are dealing,

86
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,800
then you are not a guru.

87
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,640
And the new personality has to be

88
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,640
a special personality of very unique

89
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:43,520
combination of compassion and dynamism.

90
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,840
So it is important

91
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,640
that in your creativity

92
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:04,440
you have to use the energy of compassion.

93
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,680
You can only mold people through compassion

94
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,920
and never through anger,

95
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,080
never through suppression,

96
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,960
never through showing off

97
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
your powers of gurudom.

98
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:28,640
Unless and until you handle the situation

99
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:33,080
and the personality very carefully,

100
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:37,600
showing all the respect,

101
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,160
showing all the concern

102
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,120
and all the love

103
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,280
for the person whom you are giving realization.

104
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,680
Just showing off that you are a great guru,

105
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,080
it will only create a kind of a fear about you,

106
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,080
and after some time people would not like to see your faces

107
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,200
So the most important thing about

108
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,880
Guru Principle is that you have to create.

109
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:23,000
Many people get realization, all right,

110
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,680
they get realization

111
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:29,440
and then they stay in some ashrams maybe.

112
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,800
They come to pujas,

113
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,160
they listen to music, they may dance,

114
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,400
they laugh, they're collective,

115
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,400
but still their Guru Principle is not awakened

116
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,080
unless and until they have created

117
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,800
many, many more Sahaja yogis, Sahaja yogis.

118
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:01,360
So the vision of a guru should be,

119
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:06,200
"How many Sahaja yogis I am going to create?

120
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:10,240
How am I going to use this creativity

121
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,240
to create more Sahaja yogis?"

122
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,680
So the basis or the essence of the Swadisthana Chakra,

123
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,760
though is aesthetics,

124
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:28,240
the force and the energy of Swadisthana Chakra

125
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,200
is attention.

126
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:35,440
If you have a wobbly attention,

127
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:40,520
if your attention is one minute here, one minute there;

128
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,120
if you have an attention by which you just can criticize ot

129
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:48,000
and cannot see your own faults;

130
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:51,560
if you have an attention by which

131
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,600
you show people that you are a frivolous, nonsensical perso

132
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:07,000
then your Guru Principle is wasted.

133
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,680
It is the effort of Sahaja Yoga that is wasted,

134
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:16,120
and your Guru's job is also wasted.

135
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:28,400
Minimum of minimum, first the attention has to be pure.

136
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:34,160
But pure attention doesn't mean harshness,

137
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:37,080
it doesn't mean asceticism,

138
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:39,880
it doesn't mean disciplining your eyes

139
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:44,440
like a blinkers of horse,

140
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,040
but in all freedom

141
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:52,440
your attention to be concentrated.

142
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,280
Where do we pay our attention the most?

143
00:11:56,480 --> 00:12:01,680
If we are honest we can think on human level

144
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,440
we pay our attention to our children,

145
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,080
to our wife, to our husbands, to our family,

146
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:16,520
the relationships which are with love.

147
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,520
So when your attention

148
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:26,920
has got

149
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:32,640
the compassion

150
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:37,920
and the love for another person,

151
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,160
then only you can work out the realization of others.

152
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:48,080
If you have to work out the realization of others,

153
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:53,560
it has to be an intense love

154
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,480
for another person.

155
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,680
If you don't have that intensity,

156
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,280
you are just moving your hands raising the kundalini

157
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:09,360
because your Mother has given you powers, and it's finished

158
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:13,200
That intensity of love

159
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,200
can only give you success

160
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,520
with your pure attention,

161
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,840
and I think the pure attention can only love.

162
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,560
Impure attention cannot love,

163
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:33,600
because all impure attention is self-oriented,

164
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,360
I-oriented.

165
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,480
They are not "self" in the sense "spiritual-oriented."

166
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,320
But the idea that spirituality is love,

167
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:54,680
it seems to be a new idea for many people.

168
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:00,360
They think spirituality means a person who is just

169
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,240
absolutely dry like a beanstalk

170
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,680
and

171
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
nobody can go near that person,

172
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:15,480
nobody can communicate

173
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:22,560
with such a person because that person is "too pure."

174
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:27,320
If the soap cannot cleanse your body,

175
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,200
what's the use of having the soap?

176
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:36,480
If the soap is afraid to come near you,

177
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:41,720
then it's better not to be called as soap.

178
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:46,120
So we come to the point

179
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:53,480
that the creativity, if it is our aim, lakshya,

180
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:58,840
for that the attention we should purify,

181
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:07,840
and to be purified with love, with compassion.

182
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:14,280
And the same attention when it is filled with love and comp

183
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:18,920
it gives you dynamism, it gives you strength,

184
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,040
it's untiring zeal you get.

185
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:32,200
And the joy of seeing your reflection into another person

186
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,320
is very beautiful.

187
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,640
No words can describe it.

188
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:42,760
Actually when you give realization to another person,

189
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:47,320
what you try to see is your image in that person,

190
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:50,760
as if out of an ordinary glass

191
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:54,200
you are making it into a beautiful mirror

192
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:57,520
and then you want to see that.

193
00:15:58,600 --> 00:16:00,600
That is how you create,

194
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:05,920
you create your own reflections and

195
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:11,960
through the cleansing of the reflectors,

196
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:17,920
once you understand that without creativity

197
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,440
this Guru Puja is useless for you.

198
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:26,720
If you just live for yourself, or your family,

199
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,160
for your husband or just for an ashram,

200
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,920
then you have not expanded at all,

201
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:40,760
you have not done any duty towards your Guru.

202
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,640
Of course as soon as you take to this principle

203
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,400
you develop so many qualities within you.

204
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,280
The first you develop is wisdom,

205
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:02,080
because you realize where you are going wrong,

206
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:07,360
why this is not working out, why there's a problem,

207
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,080
why your creativity doesn't act.

208
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,600
It becomes evident to you, obvious to you

209
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,520
and you start learning;

210
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:24,400
and wisdom comes to you, and you understand.

211
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:28,200
Wisdom is when you realize your mistakes

212
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:31,200
and rectify them,

213
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,080
and with that you develop the balance,

214
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,840
the understanding

215
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:43,520
how to deal with another personality.

216
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,600
I always tell the story of a car,

217
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:53,680
that there's an accelerator and also there's a brake.

218
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:58,200
You have to use first both of them without understanding why

219
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,800
still you are not a guru,

220
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,840
you are not even a driver.

221
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:07,640
Then when you know then you automatically drive;

222
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:12,760
then you are a driver, but still the master is sitting behind

223
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,040
So now you have to become the master,

224
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,240
and when you become the master you can balance the vehicle

225
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:26,880
and you can see the driver, accelerator and also the brake.

226
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:32,920
And you can manage it just in a very simple manner.

227
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,160
So this Guru Principle is limited,

228
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,200
and goes on increasing its limitations

229
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,200
like the horizon.

230
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:55,680
As you start growing into more creativity,

231
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:59,520
the more people you create.

232
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:05,160
And the central point of this one is the Nabhi,

233
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:08,640
is the center which

234
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,320
like a big pivotal point

235
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,640
on which the whole of this movement takes place.

236
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,440
Nabhi Chakra as you know,

237
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:27,040
you get it from your mother to begin with.

238
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:31,120
So a guru has to be the mother,

239
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,600
he must have the qualities of the mother

240
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,480
not the modern mothers, but in the real sense of the word.

241
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,520
That is,

242
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,240
a guru has to love her children

243
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,360
and has to have strength and courage

244
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:55,680
to correct her children.

245
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,760
And the earnest desire should be

246
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,800
to put the children onto proper lines

247
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,840
to guide them and to help them to rise.

248
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,440
So the first nourishment comes to us

249
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,160
even when we are in the womb of the mother,

250
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,800
through the mother; and so

251
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:25,040
you are the mother though you may be a man or a woman,

252
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:29,400
but in quality you are the mother.

253
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:34,080
And whatever you think or whatever you do

254
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,840
has an effect on the child.

255
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,920
The way you behave, the way you talk,

256
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:47,000
the way you live, everything has a bearing

257
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,560
on the development of the child.

258
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,440
In the same way when,

259
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,600
supposing a Sahaja yogi who is trying to give realization

260
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,680
is a hypocritical person, if he's a wrong type of a person,

261
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,800
if he does not respect his own Guru,

262
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,000
the children behave the same manner

263
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,720
and they take to wrong things much faster,

264
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,640
they see to wrong things first.

265
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:25,840
So you have to be perfect in your behavior

266
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:29,440
towards your own Guru,

267
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:34,400
you have to respect your own Guru in a full way.

268
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,160
Complete surrender to your own Guru is important;

269
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,360
then they will see how you have treated your own Guru,

270
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:46,000
and that is how they will treat you.

271
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,440
If you don't treat your Guru with that respect,

272
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,160
with that understanding,

273
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,360
with that surrendering,

274
00:21:55,560 --> 00:21:59,600
then don't expect your children

275
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:05,160
or the people whom you are guiding are going to respect you

276
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,640
So this Guru Principle within us has to be

277
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:14,600
like a great sage or a great seer,

278
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:19,920
who is above the normal mundane people

279
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,320
and sees the things in a proper perspective,

280
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,080
and delivers

281
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:32,080
a proper understanding

282
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,320
of all this perspective he sees,

283
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:38,200
to his disciples,

284
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:43,320
doesn't give them distorted or wrong ideas.

285
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:54,360
Now one may say that, "Mother, how is it, that the love

286
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,400
we can express and also tell them the truth?"

287
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:07,800
You have to look after the benevolence -- hitha.

288
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:14,200
You have to look after the benevolence of your disciple.

289
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,560
It may appear that

290
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:21,240
he may not like what you are telling that person today,

291
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,880
but a day will come when he will think

292
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:28,240
"Thank God your Guru has corrected you

293
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:31,160
and has put you on the right path."

294
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,320
If the goal of the disciple is not to ascend,

295
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:41,480
is just to be there for some sort of a purpose,

296
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:45,880
then it's better not to have such disciples.

297
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,880
Not to have anyone of this kind

298
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,000
who are not there for their own ascent,

299
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,800
but for other gains, which are absolutely of no avail.

300
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,160
This question arises sometimes, how to love?

301
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,240
It's a very funny question

302
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:20,400
that we don't know how to love human beings.

303
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:25,160
We can love our things, we can love our useless things,

304
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,080
we can love some sort of a beautiful scenery

305
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,160
because it gives us joy.

306
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:36,240
We can love some

307
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,720
nice restaurant because you can get good food there,

308
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,560
or some sort of a thing which is of a very baser nature.

309
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:51,160
But love for love's sake is this,

310
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:58,160
that when you really love for love's sake,

311
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,160
then you try to put

312
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:06,960
or implant that love into somebody else,

313
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:14,080
that you make another person as loveable as you are.

314
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,560
So the whole system becomes different if you understand

315
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,080
that we have to base all our progress,

316
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,880
all our love, all our movements, all our behavior,

317
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,480
all our understanding on love.

318
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:36,080
Otherwise your Guru Principl is extremely weak,

319
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:40,160
and after some time you will find you are just standing

320
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:44,800
out of the shores of Sahaja Yoga.

321
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,880
Anybody who is attached or biased and has conditionings

322
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:57,400
cannot become a guru, cannot;

323
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,560
because even if he becomes, so-called,

324
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,960
all those things will be reflected in that person.

325
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,960
Or say if he is very full of ego, thinks no end of himself

326
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:13,960
and thinks that, "I am a great guru,"

327
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:17,160
that ego also would be expressed.

328
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,960
Supposing such a guru talks too much,

329
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:27,160
also they find the disciple the same style.

330
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:32,160
If he is a quiet type, you find the disciple the same style

331
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:36,640
So we reach a conclusion that first we must develop

332
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,400
our own Guru Principle.

333
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:48,960
If we cannot develop that, it is no use doing any Guru Puja

334
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:54,640
because it is just temporary, it's not going to help you much,

335
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:59,640
unless and until you really decide

336
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:05,160
that you are going to nourish

337
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:10,720
and develop and establish your Guru Principle.

338
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,480
So today when you are worshipping Me as the Guru,

339
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,320
you must know that any amount of My talking,

340
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:25,000
any amount of My giving you blessings or anything

341
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,320
is not going to work out, nless and until

342
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:35,400
we really develop our own Guru Principle, and the depth.

343
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,800
Because a guru

344
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:46,000
makes his disciple cross the Bhavasagara,

345
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,000
he's like the boat

346
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:55,400
who takes his disciples and crosses

347
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:02,240
with love and with proper direction.

348
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:06,640
That has to be with all of you.

349
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:09,960
As it is you are all realized souls

350
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,080
and as I have told you, you are all angels.

351
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,960
But if you do not establish your Guru Principle,

352
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:22,800
you know of angels how they have fallen down and gone forever.

353
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,480
So be careful: it's easy to be an angel

354
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,480
but difficult to maintain it.

355
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,800
It is difficult to be the Gods and Goddesses,

356
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,560
but easy to maintain it.

357
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:47,640
So all of you are here. I'm very happy to see

358
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:51,720
that you have come to worship Me as your Guru.

359
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,880
And I would expect that My children

360
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,720
are after My own image.

361
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:04,640
That My image should be such that My children

362
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:09,080
should feel that oneness with My image,

363
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:14,240
and I should be a proud Mother of so many children

364
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,480
who have come from so many countries.

365
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,160
May God bless you all.

366
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Now with so many people here, so many children here,

367
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:42,240
we can have all the children just to wash My feet,

368
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:45,160
and after that we'll need some girls

369
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,160
who are above sixteen years

370
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,640
to twenty-one years, we can say.

371
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,560
And then some ladies

372
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,080
for the purpose of

373
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,720
worshipping Shakti, the Goddess.

374
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:14,160
Without the Shakti nothing can be done.

375
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:21,640
So first the children have to come up just to wash the feet

376
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:50,400
And I hope the world leaders will be here also.

377
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,400
They are in the image of gurus now.

378
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,160
And the leaders have to be something special.

379
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,160
You are not a leader

380
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:06,800
if you are such an ordinary, mundane type of a person.

381
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:46,880
Now, where are the musicians?

382
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,560
Where are the musicians?

383
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,160
All right.

384
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,880
So you have to first say the Atharva Sheersha,

385
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:06,800
and then you have to sing the Ganesha Stuthi,

386
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,240
or maybe any other thing that you know of Ganesha.
