1989-0723 Importance of pure attention

00:01.960 --> 00:07.360
So the basis or the essence of the Swadisthana chakra,

00:07.560 --> 00:10.440
though is aesthetics,

00:11.040 --> 00:14.920
the force and the energy of Swadisthana chakra

00:15.120 --> 00:17.880
is attention.

00:18.960 --> 00:22.920
If you have a wobbly attention,

00:23.200 --> 00:27.200
if your attention is one minute here, one minute there;

00:27.400 --> 00:31.900
if you have an attention by which you just can criticize others

00:32.020 --> 00:34.754
and cannot see your own faults;

00:34.875 --> 00:38.915
if you have an attention by which you show people

00:39.331 --> 00:45.211
that you are a frivolous, nonsensical person,

00:48.140 --> 00:53.580
then your Guru Principle is wasted.

00:54.299 --> 00:58.339
It is the effort of Sahaja Yoga that is wasted,

00:58.492 --> 01:02.332
and your Guru’s job is also wasted.

01:08.779 --> 01:10.859
Minimum of minimum,

01:10.980 --> 01:14.935
first the attention has to be pure.

01:15.251 --> 01:20.811
But pure attention doesn’t mean harshness,

01:21.003 --> 01:23.723
it doesn’t mean asceticism,

01:23.960 --> 01:26.560
it doesn’t mean disciplining your eyes

01:26.745 --> 01:31.183
like a blinkers of horse,

01:31.304 --> 01:38.245
but in all freedom your attention to be concentrated.

01:39.356 --> 01:43.038
Where do we pay our attention the most?

01:43.159 --> 01:48.479
If we are honest we can think on human level

01:48.599 --> 01:52.119
we pay our attention to our children,

01:52.319 --> 01:56.759
to our wife, to our husbands, to our family,

01:56.959 --> 02:03.199
to our relationships which are with love.

02:04.279 --> 02:12.199
So when your attention has got

02:15.319 --> 02:23.679
the compassion and the love for another person,

02:24.839 --> 02:30.599
then only you can work out the realization of others.

02:31.039 --> 02:34.759
If you have to work out the realization of others,

02:34.959 --> 02:40.239
it has to be an intense love

02:40.919 --> 02:44.159
for another person.

02:44.399 --> 02:48.359
If you don’t have that intensity,

02:48.559 --> 02:51.959
you are just moving your hands raising the kundalini

02:52.199 --> 02:56.039
because your Mother has given you powers, and it’s finished off.

02:56.239 --> 02:59.879
That intensity of love

03:00.879 --> 03:03.879
can only give you success

03:04.079 --> 03:06.199
with your pure attention,

03:06.399 --> 03:12.519
and I think the pure attention can only love.

03:12.719 --> 03:15.239
Impure attention cannot love,

03:15.439 --> 03:20.279
because all impure attention is self-oriented,

03:20.479 --> 03:23.039
I-oriented.

03:23.239 --> 03:29.159
They are not “self” in the sense “spiritual-oriented.”

03:30.839 --> 03:36.959
But the idea that spirituality is love,

03:37.199 --> 03:41.359
it seems to be a new idea for many people.

03:42.159 --> 03:47.039
They think spirituality means a person

03:47.239 --> 03:51.919
who is just absolutely dry like a beanstalk

03:53.239 --> 03:54.839
and

03:55.799 --> 03:58.919
nobody can go near that person,

03:59.119 --> 04:04.399
nobody can communicate with such a person

04:04.759 --> 04:09.239
because that person is “too pure.”

04:09.679 --> 04:14.079
If the soap cannot cleanse your body,

04:14.199 --> 04:17.879
what’s the use of having the soap?

04:18.023 --> 04:23.103
If the soap is afraid to come near you,

04:23.359 --> 04:28.399
then it’s better not to be called as soap.

04:28.520 --> 04:32.720
So we come to the point

04:32.959 --> 04:40.159
that the creativity if it is our aim, lakshya,

04:40.359 --> 04:45.519
for that the attention we should purify,

04:47.959 --> 04:52.119
and to be purified with love,

04:52.511 --> 04:54.831
with compassion.

04:55.839 --> 05:00.959
And the same attention when it is filled with love and compassion

05:01.159 --> 05:05.599
it gives you dynamism, it gives you strength,

05:05.799 --> 05:10.719
its untiring zeal you get.

05:12.534 --> 05:14.654
And the joy

05:14.775 --> 05:19.255
of seeing your reflection into another person

05:19.519 --> 05:22.037
is very beautiful.

05:22.158 --> 05:25.278
No words can describe it.

05:25.423 --> 05:29.343
Actually when you give realization to another person,

05:29.639 --> 05:33.959
what you try to see is your image in that person,

05:34.126 --> 05:37.366
as if out of an ordinary glass

05:37.583 --> 05:40.823
you are making it into a beautiful mirror

05:41.079 --> 05:44.199
and then you want to see that.

05:45.286 --> 05:52.606
That is how you create, you create your own reflections

05:53.623 --> 05:59.046
and through the cleansing of the reflectors,

05:59.247 --> 06:04.527
once you understand that without creativity

06:04.750 --> 06:08.070
this Guru Puja is useless for you.
