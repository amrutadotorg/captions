00:00.000 --> 00:08.065
First Public Program in Turkey (Istanbul)
Emirgan Korusu, 25.06.1989

03:36.445 --> 03:41.706
I bow to all the seekers of truth

03:46.363 --> 03:48.720
Can somebody translate me?

03:50.523 --> 03:54.702
Gregoire: I can see, they are already in meditation

04:25.277 --> 04:31.067
I said, I bow to all the seekers of truth.

04:43.932 --> 04:48.432
Now, we have to realised

04:48.511 --> 04:52.289
that truth can not be conceptualized.

04:57.955 --> 05:03.026
Truth is and will feel all the time.

05:08.147 --> 05:11.099
We can not organize it.

05:14.853 --> 05:18.027
And those who are seeking truth,

05:18.055 --> 05:21.776
after know that they should keep their minds open.

05:22.194 --> 05:24.177
Like a scientist.

05:30.838 --> 05:33.211
And whatever we are telling you,

05:33.236 --> 05:36.363
has to be taken as a hypothesis.

05:40.380 --> 05:48.551
And if it proofs, right, than you have to
accept it as honest people.

05:56.694 --> 06:01.785
Since long there has been talked about truth.

06:06.472 --> 06:11.225
Socrates  talked about it
and he was killed.

06:16.474 --> 06:22.254
Then came Christ he talked about it
he was killed.

06:26.277 --> 06:33.311
Then came prophet Mohammed Sahap
and he was also in a way killed.

06:40.368 --> 06:43.947
But today the human awareness is much better.

06:50.294 --> 06:54.936
And we are understanding that truth has to be

06:54.961 --> 06:58.746
beyond our mental projections.

07:11.281 --> 07:15.067
When we see those people who talk of peace

07:15.092 --> 07:19.281
and talk of any theories of democracy

07:19.306 --> 07:22.223
or capitalism or communism

07:30.012 --> 07:36.602
or they talk of any religion like Islam,
Hinduism, Christianity.

07:42.726 --> 07:45.392
Everyone is the just the same.

07:47.775 --> 07:52.906
There is no binding force,
anybody can commit any sin.

07:58.309 --> 08:00.856
So where are we got wrong.

08:04.539 --> 08:10.078
All these prophets and saints
and incarnations were

08:10.103 --> 08:16.023
absolutely truthful
but where have we gone wrong.

08:24.227 --> 08:27.433
There is one thing common among all of them

08:27.457 --> 08:32.734
that they said, you must see the eternal.

08:40.767 --> 08:44.936
And considering things are
to be used in their moderation

08:44.952 --> 08:47.692
and in their limitations.

08:55.601 --> 08:58.910
This is the essence of all the religions.

09:04.395 --> 09:08.966
But we have gone wrong
because we did not see later.

09:15.372 --> 09:18.999
And got lost into transitory things.

09:23.573 --> 09:25.977
There was nothing wrong with those

09:26.001 --> 09:31.656
who started on these great religions
and great philosophy.

09:40.931 --> 09:43.153
But we missed the point.

09:47.018 --> 09:50.301
But today the human awareness has reached

09:50.306 --> 09:53.960
the state where it can see so clearly.

10:01.075 --> 10:07.930
That the fulfillment of the promises
given to us has to be done.

10:13.527 --> 10:19.910
It is said that there is the ruh,
the all-pervading power round us.

10:27.638 --> 10:30.741
All the living things
that you see like flowers,

10:30.766 --> 10:36.389
fruits and trees and
human beings are miracles.

10:43.624 --> 10:47.163
These are worked out.
These are worked out through

10:47.188 --> 10:50.804
this all-pervading subtle power.

10:59.309 --> 11:05.726
But so far we have never felt it
enmass, this power.

11:11.305 --> 11:16.045
Few saints have faith it
but nobody would believe that.

11:21.716 --> 11:25.181
But now a special blossom time has come.

11:29.141 --> 11:31.650
And in this blossom time

11:31.666 --> 11:35.911
we are going to find out the truth
without any difficulties.

11:41.721 --> 11:45.247
It has should be the easiest thing

11:45.263 --> 11:48.011
because it is a living process.

11:53.954 --> 11:59.961
But you saw the seed in the mother earth
it sprouts spontaneously.

12:09.923 --> 12:14.837
In the same way within us,  this power

12:14.862 --> 12:19.835
which I have told you, is described
as al-Asas, (The Foundation) in Koran.

12:28.176 --> 12:32.596
In the Bible as the holy ghost.

12:39.225 --> 12:43.097
And in the inner scriptures as Adi Shakti,

12:44.501 --> 12:47.501
Primordial Mother as Athina.

12:57.686 --> 13:05.239
Resides in triangular bone called as sacrum,
meaning sacred bone.

13:12.351 --> 13:16.266
This is the power of God’s desire

13:16.291 --> 13:22.239
which resides within us
as our pure desire.

13:31.968 --> 13:40.074
And it spontaneously rises and break
through our fontanel bone area.

13:52.028 --> 14:00.398
So actually, you get the actualization
of your baptism, actualization.

14:08.720 --> 14:13.719
It is not just artificial certificate.

14:20.389 --> 14:25.127
Once you become connected with
the all-pervading power

14:25.167 --> 14:27.222
and you become a saint

14:35.352 --> 14:37.943
or you become wali (a Muslim saint)

14:40.201 --> 14:42.899
or you become a self realized soul.

14:46.644 --> 14:49.055
As a result of that,

14:49.080 --> 14:53.561
transformation starts taking place
in every human being.

14:59.703 --> 15:02.969
And this transformation is very unique.

15:06.151 --> 15:11.685
Such a person automatically becomes purified.

15:17.338 --> 15:21.808
You don’t have to tell such a person, don’t do, don’t do.

15:21.833 --> 15:24.730
He just does not do wrong things.

15:30.749 --> 15:36.140
He becomes very dynamic
but very compassionate.

15:41.295 --> 15:48.310
And lives in complete joy and peace.

15:55.186 --> 15:59.839
All this is your right, as human beings to have it.

16:04.547 --> 16:09.840
This is the glory, that is within us.

16:17.428 --> 16:22.685
Only, our instrument has to be connected to the main.

16:30.743 --> 16:36.065
Also, physical, mental, emotional disorders

16:36.090 --> 16:39.901
get completely corrected by this power.

16:49.003 --> 16:55.862
And you start feeling this
formless energy all round yourself.

17:04.005 --> 17:09.984
So, you get your enlightenment
your attention becomes enlightened.

17:18.473 --> 17:23.878
Now we have here people from,
I don’t know how many countries

17:23.931 --> 17:29.581
who have come to Istanbul to meet you all.

17:39.298 --> 17:44.596
It is surprising how it was difficult for

17:44.621 --> 17:50.383
anyone of this western country people,
specially English, French

17:50.408 --> 17:54.159
who even pronounce one Indian Hindi word

17:54.184 --> 17:58.704
or any other language in Indian language.

18:10.375 --> 18:13.326
But now, these we are pronounce sanskrit.

18:15.546 --> 18:18.648
And later all they will be singing Arabic.

18:21.152 --> 18:24.564
Because now they have become universal being.

18:28.072 --> 18:32.462
And this is what we have to touch
this our universal being which is the spirit.

18:39.829 --> 18:45.157
Now we have people, we have Jews
who worshiped Muhammad Sahap,

18:45.160 --> 18:47.898
who worshiped Christ.

19:00.932 --> 19:07.719
Because through their experience of truth,
they have realized that they were incarnations.

19:13.263 --> 19:16.731
All these great incarnations and prophets

19:16.756 --> 19:21.487
came on the same tree of life, at different times

19:29.384 --> 19:33.415
to give us balance and to save us from evil.

19:39.331 --> 19:44.505
But we have plucked the flowers and
we are saying this is mine this is mine

19:44.518 --> 19:47.891
and fighting with these dead flowers.

19:55.990 --> 20:00.294
So it is important for all people who are honest

20:00.318 --> 20:03.784
and who are seeking the truth,

20:03.792 --> 20:07.085
should achieve their self-realization and see

20:07.189 --> 20:12.292
the absolute truth about them.

20:21.347 --> 20:25.914
They never talked ill about each other

20:29.981 --> 20:33.464
but only we, in our ignorance do that.

20:38.285 --> 20:42.436
So, this light has to come within us.

20:45.775 --> 20:48.793
Supposing we are holding a snake in our hand

20:48.811 --> 20:53.773
and there is darkness and your eyes are not open.

20:53.808 --> 20:58.293
You will not believe, if somebody says
there is a snake in your hand.

21:10.876 --> 21:15.542
But if you get the light and your eyes are open up,

21:15.553 --> 21:20.539
you will immediately yourself believe that snake.

21:28.807 --> 21:32.634
So, a person become so powerful and so free

21:32.682 --> 21:39.805
that no bad habits can dominate him.

21:53.842 --> 22:00.399
You yourself, become your own master
and manage yourself.

22:05.703 --> 22:09.623
I do not have to tell you, don’t do this and don’t do that.

22:13.315 --> 22:16.312
I am sorry for today’s delay but

22:16.337 --> 22:22.569
you know, there were problems
of traffic and all kinds of things.

22:30.396 --> 22:33.102
It was very unexpected.

22:36.979 --> 22:40.883
So, I hope, you will excuse me for coming late.

22:46.381 --> 22:50.008
Tomorrow of course, I will be here much earlier

22:50.019 --> 22:54.693
and explain to you much more about Sahaja Yoga.

23:00.635 --> 23:05.767
Sahaja; Saha means with, ja means born.

23:14.022 --> 23:18.775
Yoga means union with the Divine with the Ruh (spirit).

23:24.692 --> 23:28.683
So, all the human beings

23:28.706 --> 23:31.283
whatever race they will belong to

23:31.308 --> 23:34.738
have a right to achieve this stage.

23:43.045 --> 23:44.711
May God bless you all.

23:47.248 --> 23:50.071
If you want to ask me some questions,

23:50.096 --> 23:53.528
I will be very happy to answer them.

24:12.009 --> 24:13.407
Audience: I would like to ask a question.

24:13.431 --> 24:18.385
She just expressed that throughout history,
important personalities

24:18.410 --> 24:22.218
have been murdered because of
what they had said.

24:41.912 --> 24:43.600
Audience: Why did they get murdered?

24:43.625 --> 24:44.791
Audience:She gave an example.

24:44.816 --> 24:48.000
She said that Socrates was murdered
becasue of his words.

24:48.025 --> 24:51.175
She said that Hazrat Isa Aleyhissellam
had been murdered;

24:51.200 --> 24:53.911
although I do not agree with this,

24:53.936 --> 24:56.999
I wonder for which of his words was

24:56.999 --> 25:01.237
Hazrat Mohammad Aleyhisselam was murdered.

25:23.041 --> 25:26.716
Shri Mataji: No. He was supposed to be killed in the sense that

25:26.741 --> 25:30.752
you see, whatever he try to preach and

25:30.777 --> 25:35.463
try to do, people would not listen to him

25:35.488 --> 25:40.908
and he had to really struggle a lot all his life.

25:57.602 --> 26:00.618
Audience: So there is no real act of murder,

26:08.254 --> 26:12.544
Shri Mataji: No. Not that way.
That part is not important.

26:12.561 --> 26:18.310
What important part is that
what he wanted to established?

26:18.781 --> 26:22.338
In his lifetime, it was very difficult.

26:22.403 --> 26:26.166
Because the people were so ignorant.

26:43.830 --> 26:45.861
Audience: Thank you.

26:49.478 --> 26:53.250
Audience:  Does the human brain work more
in Yoga or in sleep,

26:53.292 --> 26:56.102
is there any difference between these two [unclear]

27:09.888 --> 27:11.391
Shri Mataji: What happens?

27:17.006 --> 27:22.017
Somebody: The energy wakes up during
the sleep or during a yoga section?

27:22.623 --> 27:25.291
Shri Mataji: No during, not during the sleep

27:25.308 --> 27:27.730
but during the yoga section.

27:32.324 --> 27:35.975
It is what should understand
why these great prophets came.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.518
Because they had to help us.

27:38.608 --> 27:41.871
In the same way,
the one who is enlighten,

27:41.896 --> 27:44.373
can only enlighten another person.

27:44.694 --> 27:49.792
Like one light, which is enlighten,
can enlighten.

28:04.557 --> 28:08.184
But that person has to be enlightened,

28:08.234 --> 28:11.260
is the authority that is from God.

28:11.564 --> 28:14.288
That he should be enlightened blinds.

28:14.313 --> 28:17.575
Blind people cannot give light.

28:28.350 --> 28:36.738
Audience: Had Buddha found his true
self and become a mystic?

28:37.204 --> 28:38.922
Does she agree with that?

28:38.966 --> 28:47.353
Audience:  Yes, had he found his true self
and achieved the true state of mysticism?

28:57.390 --> 28:59.350
Shri Mataji: Yes, he did. One,

28:59.421 --> 29:02.685
exceptional case, he proofed the Ruh.

29:09.132 --> 29:13.689
Actually, it was the grace of God
which worked on him

29:13.714 --> 29:18.873
and he was so, so desperate.

29:20.217 --> 29:26.362
And he had reached the state where
he would have committed suicide if he hadn’t.

29:35.390 --> 29:39.036
And when you are enlighten,
you can enlighten others.

29:39.076 --> 29:42.260
You all have all the powers to you enlighten others.

29:42.262 --> 29:45.644
Like I really don’t do it much.

29:45.653 --> 29:51.236
All of them here who are sitting are,
all I would say, can do it.

30:09.559 --> 30:15.363
If that is your capacity that is
your power today. Why not have it.

30:23.156 --> 30:25.200
For, you cannot pay for it.

30:25.225 --> 30:29.877
You cannot do anything about it.
Effortlessly you get it. Why not have it.

30:40.913 --> 30:45.818
It is so simple as that.
Today we went in the Bazaar.

30:46.142 --> 30:52.682
And there was a Armenian boy
who was selling us something.

30:52.918 --> 30:55.790
Then he said who are you?

30:56.116 --> 31:00.055
I said, I have come here to give self-realization.

31:00.824 --> 31:04.141
He said can you give me now?
I said yes.

31:04.326 --> 31:08.492
He just puts his hands towards me
and said,  “ooh I am feeling the cool breeze.”

31:50.387 --> 31:52.184
So he wanted to thank me.

31:52.209 --> 31:54.725
I said, this is your own what I have done.

31:54.735 --> 31:56.822
Why did thanking me?

32:06.375 --> 32:08.843
This all built-in in you it has got.

32:08.859 --> 32:12.035
Alright, tomorrow you will do
this to the others.

32:23.551 --> 32:26.989
Audience: Is Yoga only good for
bringing peace in this world?

32:27.014 --> 32:30.404
What are her thoughts about the hereafter?

33:02.395 --> 33:05.989
Shri Mataji: See, I have decided
not to talk about myself.

33:06.032 --> 33:11.846
The reason is, see now,
because all of them talked

33:11.864 --> 33:15.706
and said often, like Christ,

33:15.715 --> 33:18.899
he said, “I am the son of God”

33:19.364 --> 33:24.946
and everything he talked is of truth,
so what did they do to them.

33:41.468 --> 33:44.064
But I must be something no doubt.

33:44.089 --> 33:46.048
I must be knowing something.

33:46.057 --> 33:50.368
But is better, you know yourself,
then you know me better.

34:05.065 --> 34:07.620
Audience: Can anyone achieve this task?

34:18.856 --> 34:20.935
Shri Mataji: Yes of course.

34:21.602 --> 34:24.580
Anyone who has got enlightenment.

34:29.892 --> 34:32.265
Audience: Just a moment,
I would like to say a couple of things.

34:32.290 --> 34:36.317
From all your speech
and the questions of the participants,

34:36.341 --> 34:40.025
I gather that, this meeting gives the sense that,

34:40.075 --> 34:43.833
it excludes other religions,
I think that,

34:43.865 --> 34:46.789
this is how it’s being narrated right now.

34:46.805 --> 34:51.776
I kindly request Her to explain
if this is the case.

35:19.133 --> 35:21.912
Shri Mataji: Of course. It proves.

35:21.937 --> 35:25.390
It proves that  truth, of course.

35:33.116 --> 35:34.544
Of course. Of course.

35:38.732 --> 35:41.112
All religions are true.
No doubt about it

35:41.122 --> 35:44.375
but we have done mistakes.
That is the point I am saying.

35:54.764 --> 35:56.812
Audience: This is what I wanted to explain;

35:56.844 --> 35:58.678
that all religions are true,

35:58.694 --> 36:01.062
that all of them express the reality

36:01.072 --> 36:04.907
but that we make errors while trying
to understand the religions.

36:04.923 --> 36:09.515
So, with your explanation right now,
I should presume that you are trying to fix this;

36:09.540 --> 36:13.711
based on your explanation.
Is this own I should presume?

36:13.736 --> 36:22.650
So all of these other religions are in a chaos, [UNCLEAR]

36:22.675 --> 36:32.000
but because of this now
we […] they find explanations like yoga.

36:42.177 --> 36:45.200
Audience: Can she tell a bit about the tree of life?

36:54.847 --> 36:57.007
Shri Mataji: I mean tomorrow definitely.

36:57.032 --> 36:59.351
I will explain to each and everything.

36:59.367 --> 37:03.871
There is going to be no secret
about this knowledge of the roots.

37:03.898 --> 37:06.500
This is the knowledge of the roots.

37:06.525 --> 37:10.950
Only we have to become subtle, to feel it.

37:13.853 --> 37:16.480
Everything, everything.

37:20.861 --> 37:24.916
But this knowledge is love, is compassion.

37:34.153 --> 37:36.756
Audience:  What is the thing about Sahaja Yoga

37:36.781 --> 37:38.623
that distinguishes it from
the other methods.

37:38.648 --> 37:42.381
I would like her to give an explanation.
If you wish […]

37:52.075 --> 37:54.408
Shri Mataji: other yogas?

37:54.433 --> 37:58.264
Shri Mataji: See. That way, all other yogas

37:58.288 --> 38:03.057
are actually an integral part of Sahaja Yoga.

38:10.087 --> 38:15.692
If you do say Hatha Yoga,
in that also, it is first of all, the cleansing

38:15.700 --> 38:19.116
this that and all that and then
you reach a point

38:19.140 --> 38:22.237
where you have to take realization.

38:29.479 --> 38:34.434
Allright. Now, the second is
you can say, Raja Yoga and all that

38:34.457 --> 38:37.858
the way they preach is artificial.

38:53.537 --> 38:55.536
Like in Raja Yoga,

38:55.553 --> 39:02.408
they say that, you should take
your tongue backwards

39:02.433 --> 39:06.873
and you should put your stomach
tight and all those things.

39:06.898 --> 39:10.701
But when kundalini rises,
automatically it happens.

39:10.734 --> 39:12.781
You don’t have to do it.

39:31.474 --> 39:33.743
Like when your car starts,

39:33.768 --> 39:37.206
all the machinery starts moving automatically.

39:37.231 --> 39:40.385
But supposing, you just take
the wheel and start moving,

39:40.410 --> 39:42.211
the car won’t move.

39:58.827 --> 40:06.555
So, one has to understand that
yoga means; union with the divine.

40:12.223 --> 40:16.008
Now, the difference is that in modern times ,

40:16.033 --> 40:18.451
nobody has time to go to Himalaya

40:18.476 --> 40:21.998
and sit there for hours together, cleansing themselves.

40:31.656 --> 40:34.481
So, I have found a method.

40:34.513 --> 40:37.785
By which first of all raise your kundalini.

40:49.095 --> 40:51.183
And most of you, I am surprised,

40:51.208 --> 40:54.121
you get your realization for fix that moment.

41:04.787 --> 41:08.001
But supposing, somebody do not get it fixed.

41:08.017 --> 41:11.170
Then they can see in that little light,
what is wrong with them

41:11.181 --> 41:15.285
and they improve themselves.
I don’t have to tell them.

41:26.793 --> 41:29.213
So you become your own master.

41:34.358 --> 41:37.312
Audience:  In the transcendental meditation technique,

41:37.337 --> 41:39.567
when people access a certain consciousness,

41:39.592 --> 41:42.879
they rise a couple of centimeters from the ground.

41:53.464 --> 41:55.768
Shri Mataji: No. It is all, it is not true.

41:55.784 --> 41:57.315
It is falsehood.

41:58.801 --> 42:03.822
You see, first, you must know that
anybody who takes money from you

42:03.847 --> 42:07.675
in the name of religion,
in the name of yoga, in anything,

42:07.700 --> 42:11.042
is a false guru.

42:22.955 --> 42:25.440
I don’t mind, even they being cheats,

42:25.465 --> 42:29.427
but not only they cheat you,
not only they cheat you,

42:29.452 --> 42:31.637
but they spoil your kundalini

42:31.662 --> 42:34.934
and they spoil your chances of realization.

42:34.959 --> 42:39.572
We had about only 4 or 5 people only yesterday,

42:39.585 --> 42:42.196
who came to us from this TM.

42:42.206 --> 42:45.785
Who poor things have become recluses.

42:59.264 --> 43:00.517
Also logically,

43:01.815 --> 43:03.944
logically we should understand

43:03.960 --> 43:06.952
what is there to get up from the body

43:06.976 --> 43:10.066
and to move about. What is the sense?

43:18.706 --> 43:20.008
What is the advantage?

43:20.024 --> 43:23.063
We have to two legs to walk.
What is the need?

43:23.542 --> 43:24.779
It is stupid.

43:30.321 --> 43:34.046
All this kind of funny things,

43:34.071 --> 43:37.365
if they tell you,
why should you believe them?

43:44.056 --> 43:47.153
No scripture has talked about it.

43:50.924 --> 43:53.257
There should be some bases.

43:58.566 --> 44:02.177
Audience:  I am sorry,
here is our friend’s question:

44:02.202 --> 44:05.373
there is this one yoga in India,
Marashi Marashi,

44:05.397 --> 44:07.398
their students are doing this thing

44:07.423 --> 44:10.805
but this esteemed lady is saying
that it’s fake.

44:24.065 --> 44:26.366
Shri Mataji: (UNCLEAR) I have nothing to do with him.

44:28.682 --> 44:30.945
Go and see his bank balance. That is all.

44:40.616 --> 44:42.123
Please be careful.

44:42.166 --> 44:46.024
Please be careful. I am sorry.
They are Indians, I know.

44:46.071 --> 44:49.462
I know, they are Indians.
I am very sorry for that.

44:49.567 --> 44:52.474
That is why, I am here to tell you the truth.

45:04.889 --> 45:07.635
I have to I would like to warn also.

45:13.587 --> 45:18.590
I have talked about them in 1970,
very openly.

45:25.316 --> 45:27.355
Very openly.

45:28.716 --> 45:32.708
But still people, I don’t know how
they take to him. Because

45:32.749 --> 45:37.197
he says that he can make people pay,

45:37.222 --> 45:40.072
so people are happy,
I think to pay.

45:49.992 --> 45:52.888
Thousands of seekers are ruined.

46:05.612 --> 46:07.525
Audience: In short, does she mean fake?

46:07.550 --> 46:10.485
Shri Mataji:  Now one more question and no more. Allright?

46:11.966 --> 46:14.706
Because it is getting late now.

46:15.469 --> 46:18.837
Audience: I am one of the people who use this technique,

46:18.862 --> 46:23.077
they took the money but I am very
satisfied with this technique.

46:23.080 --> 46:26.328
Until now I had a very stressful life.

46:26.340 --> 46:28.695
It had an extremely positive impact.

46:49.886 --> 46:51.418
Audience:  There was a mistranslation.

46:51.443 --> 46:53.276
Audience:  I use TM

46:53.323 --> 46:57.188
Interpreter: Aa, I am sorry.
I made a mistake. I am sorry.

47:00.865 --> 47:02.833
Shri Mataji: I am surprise.

47:02.849 --> 47:06.896
Interpreter:  The lady meant transcendental meditation.

47:06.913 --> 47:08.000
Shri Mataji: Of course, I know.

47:08.074 --> 47:11.471
Interpreter:   But she claims that she is quite happy.

47:11.501 --> 47:15.791
I mean, she has been able to redeem
all the stress she had.

47:15.835 --> 47:17.336
Shri Mataji: Alright. Then it is alright.

47:17.361 --> 47:20.848
If she thinks so, but I can tell you this much,
that please don’t come back to me

47:20.873 --> 47:23.237
when you will have problem.

47:28.994 --> 47:32.027
Moreover, you see.
What power she has?

47:32.044 --> 47:33.894
What has she learned?

47:33.902 --> 47:36.285
Can she give realization to anyone?

47:36.310 --> 47:37.175
It is the point.

47:37.182 --> 47:40.048
What is the great transformations she has got ?

47:54.005 --> 47:57.454
You see, the mantras,
this gentleman is giving,

47:57.479 --> 47:59.748
because you don’t know sanskrit.

48:00.031 --> 48:02.554
(UNCLEAR) one is tinga,

48:02.579 --> 48:05.287
pinga, inga. These are not sanskrit.

48:05.313 --> 48:07.265
He doesn’t know sanskrit, this man.

48:15.525 --> 48:19.263
Tinga means, tinga means when
you show somebody like this.

48:19.280 --> 48:21.233
What do you say it in your language?

48:21.258 --> 48:22.258
Thump

48:22.313 --> 48:23.727
That is tinga.

48:23.735 --> 48:25.181
That is the mantra, he gives

48:25.221 --> 48:29.731
and 300 pound he charges
for giving such a stupid mantras.

48:37.315 --> 48:43.293
And another one he gives is inga,
meaning sting of the scorpion.

48:49.653 --> 48:54.561
And pinga means when you get possessed,

48:54.586 --> 48:57.635
you go round and round like that.
You see that is pinga.

49:06.529 --> 49:10.203
I am sorry. I,
I am not with that, at all.

49:14.395 --> 49:15.799
Audience: I hadn’t asked my question.

49:17.555 --> 49:19.460
I just shared my own experience.

49:19.485 --> 49:21.566
What I am trying to ask is this:

49:21.591 --> 49:23.846
the technique that they teach in the society

49:23.871 --> 49:26.508
is the special meditation technique of a caste

49:26.533 --> 49:29.837
that’s founded on veda science
that has been applied since 2000 BC.

49:29.862 --> 49:35.350
When you apply this technique in return
for money, is this a right or wrong thing?

50:08.134 --> 50:10.959
Shri Mataji:I can give you a complete story about,

50:10.967 --> 50:12.738
if you come and see me.

50:12.763 --> 50:16.565
That they started  of course in which people were

50:16.590 --> 50:20.127
stool to be jumping.I have got a

50:20.152 --> 50:24.590
whole coming sorf of a letter from that gentleman

50:24.605 --> 50:26.511
whom I have cured also.

50:26.623 --> 50:30.767
And they started course in Scotland.

50:30.792 --> 50:34.739
His name was Mr Pitapirs and his wife.

50:34.767 --> 50:36.959
She was the granddaughter of a duke.

50:36.975 --> 50:41.366
And they became bankrupt
and epileptic, 3 of them.

50:41.391 --> 50:45.179
And I have to keep them in
my own house, to treat them.

50:45.214 --> 50:47.009
And I have got a letter from them.

50:47.034 --> 50:49.582
So I mean this is what I am saying that,

50:49.605 --> 50:52.552
they go to any guru, let them go.
But then don’t come back to me.

50:52.577 --> 50:54.165
Because I headache for them.

51:32.167 --> 51:35.581
I will send you his letter.
You can see it.

51:36.864 --> 51:40.761
Now poor man, he became bankrupt
and he has gone to South Africa.

51:52.412 --> 51:54.922
And he is told me that he used to tell that,

51:54.938 --> 51:58.748
he could pass through the wall he could jump up

51:58.773 --> 52:01.950
in the air, then all lies.

52:01.974 --> 52:04.802
Because he puts so much money in it.

52:17.749 --> 52:19.733
Audience: Also in the society, I am saying this in parentheses,
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

52:19.758 --> 52:21.390
they don’t tell us that there is such a thing.

52:21.415 --> 52:24.221
Shri Mataji: Alright now we don’t want to anymore of this TM.

52:26.373 --> 52:30.391
Now let it be now.
Let us have the realization part.

52:30.876 --> 52:31.717
Better.

52:31.781 --> 52:33.177
Audience: Excuse me can I have your attention?

52:33.209 --> 52:37.547
How are we going to learn this
system of yoga and how we can apply this?

52:37.571 --> 52:39.302
Interpreter:  We will show tomorrow.

52:39.327 --> 52:41.310
Interpreter: Tomorrow,

52:41.936 --> 52:42.714
Let us have this please.

52:42.739 --> 52:44.258
Interpreter: It got late now.

52:45.564 --> 52:48.424
Audience:We can’t do tomorrow, it will be too crowded.

52:49.583 --> 52:53.822
Interpreter:  He has worried that
tomorrow session will be too crowded

52:53.841 --> 52:57.031
and they may not be able to get  realisation.

52:57.053 --> 52:58.682
Shri Mataji: get realization.
So let us have the realization

52:58.706 --> 53:01.650
that what I am saying,
you are reel seekers.

53:13.656 --> 53:17.195
Very simple it is. Very simple.

53:17.386 --> 53:19.798
Alright. Now, just think that

53:19.825 --> 53:22.399
we have to use the power of the mother earth

53:22.424 --> 53:26.028
so we have to take out our shoes. That is all.

53:26.686 --> 53:28.092
Take out our shoes.

53:34.322 --> 53:37.309
As we take out for any ibadet in centers.

53:47.595 --> 53:49.827
And have we put our hands for namaz.

53:49.851 --> 53:53.083
Namaz, the thing, Mohammed sahib told you,

53:53.108 --> 53:55.895
it was all kundalini awakening. It was all.

54:07.903 --> 54:10.124
Just, everything.

54:10.589 --> 54:12.494
Now.

54:18.160 --> 54:20.223
Now before you close your eyes,

54:20.239 --> 54:23.066
I will tell you, how to help your centers

54:23.091 --> 54:26.084
which are on left hand side. We will work out.

54:32.596 --> 54:34.643
Very simple it is.

54:37.401 --> 54:40.363
First, you have put your left hand towards me

54:40.372 --> 54:44.001
which is symbolically.
This is the power of desire.

54:44.019 --> 54:46.646
So you want to have your realization.

54:53.159 --> 54:55.801
Now so, left hand towards me like this,

54:55.818 --> 54:59.232
simple and the right hand on your heart.

54:59.266 --> 55:02.575
Because in the heart resides your spirit.

55:05.394 --> 55:08.640
Left towards me, left, left, left hand towards me.

55:08.665 --> 55:12.318
Right, right hand on the heart.

55:14.026 --> 55:16.482
Right, right.
Alright,

55:16.712 --> 55:21.901
Now, then this is the center where the spirit resides.

55:27.204 --> 55:32.957
Now you have to put your hand in the upper part of
your abdomen on the left hand side.

55:40.289 --> 55:42.495
And then you have to put your right hand

55:42.520 --> 55:46.846
in the lower part of your abdomen
on the left hand side, again.

55:52.722 --> 56:00.099
Now the upper part of your abdomen
is the center of your mastery.

56:00.806 --> 56:02.896
Of your mastery.

56:20.656 --> 56:24.671
Now, in the lower part of your abdomen, on the left hand side,

56:24.722 --> 56:29.357
is the center of pure knowledge which

56:29.734 --> 56:33.308
manifests through your central nervous system.

56:45.215 --> 56:48.111
Now,  you put your hand again

56:48.146 --> 56:51.177
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side

56:51.193 --> 56:53.939
which is the center of our mastery.

57:02.522 --> 57:05.950
Now, you put your right hand, again on the heart

57:05.964 --> 57:08.000
which is the spirit.

57:14.168 --> 57:18.414
Now, the center between the neck

57:18.439 --> 57:21.753
and your shoulder, in the corner,

57:21.778 --> 57:25.874
you put your hand and turn your head to your right.

57:33.162 --> 57:37.692
Now, this is the center, we catch,
when we feel guilty.

57:42.557 --> 57:45.501
You should be very pleasantly place toward yourself,

57:45.526 --> 57:50.686
after all you are a human being and if you commit mistakes,

57:50.721 --> 57:53.849
after all you are not God.

58:08.440 --> 58:14.243
Now, you put your hand on your forehead
across, and press it hard.

58:18.753 --> 58:22.927
This is the center of forgiveness.

58:28.343 --> 58:32.684
Now you put your right hand on the backside of your head

58:32.709 --> 58:35.059
and push behind your head.

58:41.167 --> 58:47.518
This is the center of asking for
forgiveness without feeling guilty.

58:55.331 --> 58:57.196
Now stretch your hand

58:58.529 --> 59:03.271
and put the center of your hand on top of your head,

59:03.885 --> 59:08.531
bend your head,
push back your fingers

59:08.885 --> 59:13.998
and move your scalp slowly, seven times.

59:14.040 --> 59:21.234
Because there are seven seats of
the seven centers in your brain.

59:28.438 --> 59:30.390
Stretch back your fingers.

59:40.349 --> 59:44.340
Now just we have to do it by closing our eyes.

59:44.365 --> 59:47.881
You can take out your spectacles.
You have to sit properly.

59:57.473 --> 01:00:00.726
Keep the legs apart from each other.

01:00:00.792 --> 01:00:05.564
Not to sit in a way that you are slouching

01:00:05.589 --> 01:00:10.288
or too much strain but in a natural, normal, straight.

01:00:20.854 --> 01:00:24.774
Now please close your eyes and don’t open them, till I tell you.

01:00:30.746 --> 01:00:33.658
Now, please put the left hand towards me.

01:00:37.721 --> 01:00:40.742
And right hand, on the heart.

01:00:44.017 --> 01:00:45.446
Please close your eyes.

01:00:47.885 --> 01:00:52.786
Here, you have to say

01:00:53.050 --> 01:00:57.347
and ask a question to me 3 times.

01:00:57.454 --> 01:00:59.708
It is a very important question.

01:00:59.716 --> 01:01:03.123
Mother, am I the spirit?

01:01:13.639 --> 01:01:14.892
3 times.

01:01:32.316 --> 01:01:35.215
If you are the spirit,
you are your guide,

01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:37.477
you are your master.

01:01:37.699 --> 01:01:39.799
So please put this right hand

01:01:39.815 --> 01:01:42.762
in the upper portion of your abdomen

01:01:42.787 --> 01:01:45.906
and press it hard the left hand side

01:01:45.949 --> 01:01:48.139
and ask me a question.

01:01:59.355 --> 01:02:02.109
Here you ask me a question again 3 times.

01:02:03.133 --> 01:02:07.494
Mother, am I my own master?

01:02:07.496 --> 01:02:10.639
Call me Mother or Shri Mataji, whatever suites you.

01:02:27.949 --> 01:02:31.917
Now, take down your hand in the
lower portion of your abdomen

01:02:32.867 --> 01:02:35.636
and press it hard.

01:02:39.127 --> 01:02:45.417
Here, I have to respect your freedom.

01:02:48.551 --> 01:02:51.725
And I can not force pure knowledge on you.

01:02:55.367 --> 01:02:58.922
So, you have to ask me, in your own freedom.

01:03:01.548 --> 01:03:03.953
Please say 6 times.

01:03:04.017 --> 01:03:09.179
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.297
Now,

01:03:23.861 --> 01:03:25.918
when you ask this question,

01:03:25.943 --> 01:03:30.334
this force of Kundalini starts rising.

01:03:53.634 --> 01:03:56.046
Now, raise your hand

01:03:57.359 --> 01:04:03.067
on the upper portion of your abdomen
on the left hand side and press it hard.

01:04:08.746 --> 01:04:10.682
As the kundalini is raising,

01:04:10.707 --> 01:04:15.805
we have to help with our confident,
our centers to open out.

01:04:24.355 --> 01:04:27.705
Here you have to say 10 times

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:32.329
Because there are 10 petals to this center.

01:04:41.328 --> 01:04:44.137
With full confidence say,

01:04:44.963 --> 01:04:50.427
Mother, I am my own master.
Say it 10 times.

01:04:58.203 --> 01:05:01.727
This center is created by own prophets.

01:05:11.964 --> 01:05:16.852
Now, one has to know

01:05:16.877 --> 01:05:19.444
that, we are not this body.

01:05:19.462 --> 01:05:23.176
We are not this mind.

01:05:23.411 --> 01:05:26.053
We are not ego.

01:05:34.694 --> 01:05:37.138
We are not our conditionings

01:05:37.162 --> 01:05:40.696
but we are pure spirit.

01:05:48.001 --> 01:05:51.556
So, now, raise your hand onto your heart.

01:05:56.925 --> 01:06:00.250
And say with full confidence,

01:06:02.827 --> 01:06:06.009
the most important truth about yourself,

01:06:10.583 --> 01:06:16.405
Mother, I am the spirit.
Say this 12 times.

01:06:38.690 --> 01:06:42.674
Now, raise your right hand,

01:06:45.475 --> 01:06:54.708
into the corner of your neck
and your shoulder.

01:06:59.703 --> 01:07:02.726
One has to know

01:07:03.395 --> 01:07:07.516
that Divine is the power

01:07:08.513 --> 01:07:13.816
of bliss and joy.

01:07:20.322 --> 01:07:21.322
But above all,

01:07:25.232 --> 01:07:30.509
above, above all it is the power of forgiveness.

01:07:37.315 --> 01:07:40.259
So whatever so called mistakes,
you have committed

01:07:40.284 --> 01:07:44.658
then be dissolved completely into that power.

01:07:53.850 --> 01:07:56.956
So please turn your face to the right.

01:07:58.992 --> 01:08:02.226
Symbolically saying that,

01:08:02.251 --> 01:08:06.361
Mother, I am not guilty.
Say it 16 times.

01:08:29.484 --> 01:08:33.937
Now, raise your right hand

01:08:33.962 --> 01:08:37.183
onto your forehead across and press it hard.

01:08:44.581 --> 01:08:46.993
You may bend your head.

01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:53.673
Here is the center to forgive.

01:08:56.871 --> 01:08:59.251
You forgive everyone.

01:09:02.989 --> 01:09:08.919
So please say with full confidence,

01:09:09.343 --> 01:09:13.081
Mother, I forgive everyone.

01:09:22.128 --> 01:09:25.889
Many people say that is difficult to forgive.

01:09:25.961 --> 01:09:31.092
But whether you forgive
or you don’t forgive, it is a myth.

01:09:39.717 --> 01:09:43.657
But if you don’t forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:09:49.117 --> 01:09:53.346
So please say from your heart,

01:09:53.371 --> 01:09:56.104
Mother I forgive everyone.

01:10:03.537 --> 01:10:08.601
Now, take your right hand

01:10:08.626 --> 01:10:10.706
on the backside of your head

01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:14.452
and allow your head to rest on it.

01:10:22.432 --> 01:10:25.027
Here without feeling guilty,

01:10:25.052 --> 01:10:30.577
without counting your mistakes for your own satisfaction.

01:10:39.562 --> 01:10:42.244
Please say,

01:10:43.649 --> 01:10:49.113
O Divine, If I have done
anything wrong, please forgive me.

01:10:59.186 --> 01:11:00.542
From your heart.

01:11:04.151 --> 01:11:09.218
Now stretch your palm and

01:11:11.429 --> 01:11:15.729
put the center of your palm on top of your head.

01:11:17.896 --> 01:11:21.689
On soft bone which was in your childhood.

01:11:27.047 --> 01:11:29.022
Push back your fingers.

01:11:31.379 --> 01:11:37.029
Now again, I can not force on you,
self realization.

01:11:44.027 --> 01:11:47.733
So now bend your head and say 7 times

01:11:47.741 --> 01:11:55.191
moving your hand with pressure
your scalp, clockwise.

01:12:05.629 --> 01:12:09.041
Mother please give me self realization.

01:12:15.052 --> 01:12:16.877
Please move 7 times.

01:13:00.499 --> 01:13:03.603
Now take down your hands.

01:13:06.392 --> 01:13:11.181
Put both the hands towards me
and open our eyes slowly.

01:13:16.900 --> 01:13:24.220
Now just see, if you are thoughtless,
you can't see any thought.

01:13:28.389 --> 01:13:33.676
Now, bend your head and put your right hand towards me.

01:13:39.139 --> 01:13:44.609
And left hand you try to feel
cool breeze out of your head.

01:14:00.710 --> 01:14:04.623
Now, put the and again put the head down

01:14:04.648 --> 01:14:07.664
and put the left hand towards me.

01:14:10.276 --> 01:14:13.776
And with the right hand see again,
if there is a cool breeze coming,

01:14:13.792 --> 01:14:15.847
could be hot also.

01:14:26.611 --> 01:14:31.332
Now, put the right hand again towards me

01:14:31.357 --> 01:14:35.425
and see with the left hand if there is
a cool breeze coming out of you.

01:14:43.779 --> 01:14:47.418
Now put your hands up in the sky,

01:14:47.443 --> 01:14:53.110
like that towards the sky, push back
your head and ask a question.

01:14:54.599 --> 01:15:00.275
Is this the all pervading power of God?

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.015
Is this the Ruh?

01:15:13.915 --> 01:15:17.525
Is this the power of love

01:15:23.878 --> 01:15:26.147
Now take down your hands

01:15:30.034 --> 01:15:32.050
You all will feel very relaxed.

01:15:35.937 --> 01:15:39.071
Now those who are felt the cool breeze of their head

01:15:40.050 --> 01:15:42.050
and in your hands,

01:15:47.352 --> 01:15:50.598
like this, so you can feel in the hand of others also,

01:15:51.778 --> 01:15:52.845
neighbor’s head.

01:15:56.424 --> 01:15:58.797
Here also, here.

01:15:59.914 --> 01:16:02.413
All of you felt it I know.

01:16:02.670 --> 01:16:05.559
So raise your hand, let’s see, both the hands.

01:16:09.496 --> 01:16:12.352
Those who are felt  is this, raise your hands.

01:16:20.244 --> 01:16:21.902
May God Bless you all.

01:16:21.936 --> 01:16:24.325
So many of you are felt it.

01:16:28.611 --> 01:16:31.301
Tomorrow again you are coming here

01:16:31.334 --> 01:16:33.643
And we are going to establish it fully.

01:16:37.605 --> 01:16:40.430
You will feel very joyus, very happy.

01:16:46.256 --> 01:16:48.542
Tomorrow (UNCLEAR).

01:16:56.966 --> 01:16:59.910
I hope, you will bring your friends.

01:17:03.712 --> 01:17:06.790
You feel very relax, very happy.

01:17:10.776 --> 01:17:13.085
Especially,  I have seen muslims,

01:17:13.093 --> 01:17:16.818
they receiving very fast.

01:17:24.496 --> 01:17:26.717
Got it, I know you got it.

01:17:28.928 --> 01:17:31.430
Alright. So, please come tomorrow

01:17:31.438 --> 01:17:35.112
and don’t discuss it.
Because this is beyond your thought.

01:17:37.038 --> 01:17:39.276
Audience: What time is the meeting tomorrow?

01:17:44.375 --> 01:17:45.748
Interpreter Half past six.

01:17:47.284 --> 01:17:49.962
Shri Mataji:  I will be very early there.

01:17:49.987 --> 01:17:52.224
Tomorrow I hope there is no traffic jam.

01:17:54.371 --> 01:17:57.291
Somebody: Gentleman wants to ask a question, if you don’t mind

01:17:57.316 --> 01:18:00.932
Shri Mataji: Please come. Please come. You can come here.

01:18:00.951 --> 01:18:03.754
Audience: I am asking this so that
everybody can hear.

01:18:05.338 --> 01:18:06.829
Shri Mataji: Allright, allright.

01:18:07.379 --> 01:18:17.540
Audience:  First of all, we are happy
to see her here in Istanbul.

01:18:17.565 --> 01:18:19.708
I would like to welcome her.

01:18:26.287 --> 01:18:30.544
I need to express that in the previous questions,

01:18:30.552 --> 01:18:34.214
some concepts were indeed being misunderstood

01:18:34.239 --> 01:18:38.045
and this is because there are a lot of misinformation

01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:41.628
and wrong knowledge around these in Turkey.

01:18:57.096 --> 01:18:59.365
Shri Mataji: It is allright but one has to answer.

01:18:59.382 --> 01:19:01.079
In fact this is the first time we are attending a meeting like this

01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:03.790
As Sufis were informed about this but…

01:19:08.313 --> 01:19:10.900
Shri Mataji: No, no. It is alright. See I am a mother.

01:19:10.916 --> 01:19:13.174
So it is alright. Children must ask questions..

01:19:13.206 --> 01:19:17.491
Audience: When we talk about yoga here in Turkey,

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.586
maybe she knows about it, there is a famous Yogi Kazim.

01:19:20.602 --> 01:19:23.772
He pokes his body with skewers in circuses and stuff.

01:19:23.788 --> 01:19:25.400
When we say yoga in Turkey,

01:19:25.425 --> 01:19:28.570
everybody expects something like this
because there is such an image.

01:19:55.307 --> 01:19:56.854
Shri Mataji: No, austerities.

01:19:56.886 --> 01:20:00.374
Audience:  For this reason.
When you talk about the yoga technique,

01:20:00.399 --> 01:20:04.749
there are established prejudices bring in
such associations of meaning.

01:20:04.774 --> 01:20:08.530
We listened her and understood that this is not the case

01:20:08.555 --> 01:20:11.718
but this has to be told to everyone in a very explicit way.

01:20:11.734 --> 01:20:12.805
This image must be erased.

01:20:27.643 --> 01:20:31.865
Audience:   So just like the merchants in
every religion and every system,

01:20:31.890 --> 01:20:34.617
because they are the merchants if yoga,

01:20:34.642 --> 01:20:40.286
I would kindly ask her to be at ease that
she is not being understood in this way.

01:20:40.294 --> 01:20:42.066
Thank you.

01:21:07.304 --> 01:21:11.914
Shri Mataji: You see, there are no
austerities in Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:11.942 --> 01:21:14.212
No asceticism in Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:20.682 --> 01:21:23.388
No materyalistic life in Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:26.909 --> 01:21:31.569
God has created this world, for you, to enjoy.

01:21:31.593 --> 01:21:33.388
But in the right way.

01:21:41.037 --> 01:21:43.267
He is your father.

01:21:43.291 --> 01:21:46.465
And the greatest of fathers.

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:53.912
And why he did you guide you to be miserable.

01:21:57.014 --> 01:22:02.252
Actually, he is anxious for you
to enter into his Kingdom,

01:22:02.277 --> 01:22:04.349
enjoy his love and blessing.

01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:13.608
Thank you very much.

01:22:22.073 --> 01:22:26.144
Beautiful. Very beautiful people.

01:22:26.305 --> 01:22:31.872
You got alright. Now, laugh, enjoy.

01:23:18.351 --> 01:23:25.395
The problem is that, there was no
one here as Sahaja Yogi.

01:23:25.709 --> 01:23:28.708
Now luckily we have a lady

01:23:28.733 --> 01:23:30.909
whose husband got transport.

01:23:30.911 --> 01:23:34.438
See, I could have come much earlier here.

01:23:34.463 --> 01:23:36.234
As I have been another country.

01:23:36.250 --> 01:23:38.434
I have been working now for 18 years

01:23:38.459 --> 01:23:41.253
but there was no one in Turkey.

01:23:42.034 --> 01:23:47.322
So I had to wait for somebody to be here already.

01:23:59.238 --> 01:24:01.832
There is a lady who has got transfer here.

01:24:07.189 --> 01:24:10.101
Now we have here  the lots of people ...

01:24:17.581 --> 01:24:18.597
Thank you.

01:24:18.622 --> 01:24:20.001
Thank you so much.

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:22.146
Thank you my child.

01:24:22.171 --> 01:24:24.592
So happy today

01:24:25.978 --> 01:24:27.111
May God bless you

01:24:29.301 --> 01:24:30.721
May God bless you

01:24:31.867 --> 01:24:33.000
May God bless you

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:43.931
Look at his eyes. See now his eyes.
Look at his eyes. See.

01:24:54.999 --> 01:24:56.706
Tomorrow hope to see you.

01:24:56.715 --> 01:24:59.573
Tomorrow hope to see you madam. Alright

01:25:06.727 --> 01:25:09.370
Thank you. Are you alright.

01:25:16.299 --> 01:25:18.409
Hello, did you feel the cool breeze.

01:25:23.368 --> 01:25:25.439
Audience: Can you please ask what is the meaning?

01:25:25.464 --> 01:25:26.954
I got very curious.

01:25:26.979 --> 01:25:30.512
But there has to be a difference. Can you please ask?

01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:34.142
But there has to be a difference.

01:25:35.516 --> 01:25:37.349
Can you please ask?

01:25:46.812 --> 01:25:51.345
Shri Mataji: Thank you, thank you very much.

01:25:51.370 --> 01:25:54.715
Interpreter:  The gentleman would like
to know what exactly is different

01:25:54.723 --> 01:25:57.850
that he felt heat instead of cool breeze.

01:25:57.892 --> 01:25:59.579
Shri Mataji: Still you are feeling.

01:25:59.604 --> 01:26:03.000
Little heat in the body instead always
and now they said you can see here.

01:26:03.002 --> 01:26:05.377
If you can see here becoming softer, here.

01:26:05.402 --> 01:26:08.228
And through this all the heat is coming out.

01:26:08.252 --> 01:26:09.665
Let the heat get out.

01:26:09.676 --> 01:26:12.828
And heat will get out.
And you will feel cool better.

01:26:12.836 --> 01:26:17.539
Because in the body, in the system
they said heat will (UNCLEAR) go which is together.

01:26:17.549 --> 01:26:19.605
And (UNCLEAR) due to liver.

01:26:26.108 --> 01:26:28.973
And also he has to forgive.

01:26:28.989 --> 01:26:31.795
He has to forgive.
I think he didn’t forgive fully.

01:26:31.820 --> 01:26:32.931
So please forgive.

01:26:36.739 --> 01:26:39.396
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

01:26:39.487 --> 01:26:45.321
Please forgive. Forgive, forgive

01:26:48.622 --> 01:26:53.210
See now. You not forgive. He did not forgive.

01:26:53.485 --> 01:26:55.302
He did not forgive.

01:26:55.822 --> 01:26:57.631
Interpreter:  Nice to see you.

01:26:57.735 --> 01:27:00.417
Shri Mataji: Thank you. Look at your eyes, sparkling.

01:27:06.061 --> 01:27:08.600
Nice. Are you alright?

01:27:10.520 --> 01:27:13.972
Hello now, you, young people
have to take it up. Alright.

01:27:17.336 --> 01:27:19.208

01:27:27.382 --> 01:27:31.965
There is young people, I have to know understand and take it out.

01:27:48.793 --> 01:27:51.063

01:27:51.120 --> 01:27:53.373
Bring your friends.
