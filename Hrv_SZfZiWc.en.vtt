Talk To Sahaja Yogis: The Attitudes,
London, England 30-09-1986

00:04:34.865 --> 00:04:39.806
I will be going to India for a puja, as you know,

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:46.196
because they say in the West most of the pujas take place and they never have a chance.

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:49.486
That’s why I’m going to India.

00:04:49.495 --> 00:04:54.666
And Navaratri starts from the 4th.

00:04:54.675 --> 00:05:02.056
I hope in these nine days we’ll clear out so many of your chakras.

00:05:02.065 --> 00:05:08.896
Of course, I’ll be working on them but you have to also cooperate,

00:05:08.905 --> 00:05:15.726
watch yourself, find out what’s wrong with you,

00:05:15.735 --> 00:05:20.156
why the different chakras are catching.

00:05:20.165 --> 00:05:29.926
Now the attitude that we have towards ourselves and towards others

00:05:29.935 --> 00:05:38.652
has to be now changed in these new circumstances and in this transformation.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:48.196
The Sahaja Yoga lifestyle is not a system.

00:05:48.205 --> 00:05:49.414
You know that.

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:56.178
We don’t want to create any systems, any norms in Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:56.431 --> 00:06:07.702
But what we do here is to transform ourselves into Selfhood, into the Spirit state.

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:11.421
By that we change our attitudes.

00:06:11.525 --> 00:06:18.398
If our attitudes are not changed then we have not achieved much in Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:18.487 --> 00:06:22.858
The attitude first should be that we have to know

00:06:22.915 --> 00:06:29.782
that we are on the giving end not on the receiving end.

00:06:29.859 --> 00:06:35.445
If that happens to you automatically, spontaneously then you have achieved it.

00:06:35.521 --> 00:06:41.622
But supposing it does not happen, then you have to be on the watch out.

00:06:41.844 --> 00:06:50.388
First of all you must feel the joy of being in the Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:50.465 --> 00:06:54.428
If you cannot feel the joy then there’s something wrong with you,

00:06:54.492 --> 00:07:01.393
something wrong with your heart, heart is not clean, you have to clean your heart.

00:07:01.458 --> 00:07:07.329
If you think of your past all the time, or the past of others,

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.573
then it’s a wrong attitude completely.

00:07:10.614 --> 00:07:14.145
You have to be in the present.

00:07:14.265 --> 00:07:17.876
And the gloom and unhappiness,

00:07:17.996 --> 00:07:23.596
all these things are signs that yet you have not become your Spirit.

00:07:23.803 --> 00:07:28.429
The attitude should be: what joy I can give to others?

00:07:28.485 --> 00:07:31.136
What I have given to others?

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:39.392
And the giving is such a great joy that it cannot be surpassed by any other joy.

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:43.670
So one has to think: what did I do for others?

00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:46.302
How did I help others?

00:07:46.359 --> 00:07:48.803
How much love have I given others?

00:07:48.859 --> 00:07:51.654
How much understanding I have of others?

00:07:51.829 --> 00:08:00.055
Unless and until you develop that kind of an attitude you cannot enjoy life.

00:08:00.124 --> 00:08:04.480
People think enjoyment depends on others.

00:08:04.703 --> 00:08:06.464
“The atmosphere is bad.

00:08:06.465 --> 00:08:10.862
I’ll be happier in India, not here” - very common.

00:08:10.933 --> 00:08:14.654
It’s not so.

00:08:14.703 --> 00:08:21.184
If you are fully aware that you are the Spirit

00:08:21.193 --> 00:08:25.424
you can enjoy all the other Sahaja Yogis which are here.

00:08:25.433 --> 00:08:32.104
So a person who cannot be collective shows that he is yet very much developed.

00:08:32.113 --> 00:08:35.794
It is not how much you have studied, what personality you have got,

00:08:35.803 --> 00:08:38.794
what kind of education you have had, that’s not important.

00:08:38.803 --> 00:08:42.824
How much you can enjoy in whatever may be the circumstances,

00:08:42.833 --> 00:08:50.524
that capacity shows your identification with the Spirit.

00:08:50.533 --> 00:08:56.454
You can see me, you have seen my life, how I can adjust myself to any circumstances.

00:08:56.463 --> 00:09:02.484
A thousand and one things I can do without getting worried about it, or upset about it.

00:09:02.493 --> 00:09:04.826
I am not saying that you can achieve all that

00:09:04.881 --> 00:09:09.580
but still you should have your ideals before you.

00:09:09.635 --> 00:09:15.946
Now the part where we fail is that we start finding faults with others.

00:09:16.003 --> 00:09:18.324
This is the worst attitude.

00:09:18.333 --> 00:09:23.154
That makes you angry because you think that you are in charge of everything.

00:09:23.163 --> 00:09:27.877
I’ve seen people going on the road, they see, say for example,

00:09:27.948 --> 00:09:34.679
a funny person passing through or they find somebody

00:09:34.754 --> 00:09:41.389
who is not wearing a proper dress, or maybe he is walking in a funny manner.

00:09:41.434 --> 00:09:43.785
Immediately they get angry.

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:48.824
As if they are the policemen, as if they are in charge of the road,

00:09:48.949 --> 00:09:54.849
as if they have to correct the whole world and as if they are perfect.

00:09:54.939 --> 00:09:59.770
In Sahaja Yoga if you try these old tricks, you can never be happy.

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:02.014
Here you don’t have to see those things,

00:10:02.023 --> 00:10:07.194
just close your eyes when you see any defects of another person.

00:10:07.203 --> 00:10:09.744
Such a person is always an angry person

00:10:09.784 --> 00:10:14.475
because he finds the whole world is after his life or he finds

00:10:14.484 --> 00:10:19.355
that he has to get after the whole world: one of the two.

00:10:19.364 --> 00:10:22.695
It’s a funny existence.

00:10:22.704 --> 00:10:27.285
It’s a very disgusting, frustrating existence

00:10:27.294 --> 00:10:31.695
where you are all the time either angry with others or angry with yourself.

00:10:31.704 --> 00:10:35.675
This anger goes on multiplying and once it goes on multiplying

00:10:35.684 --> 00:10:38.385
then you become nothing but a mountain of anger.

00:10:38.394 --> 00:10:41.515
With the slightest touch you get angry.

00:10:41.524 --> 00:10:43.979
Then they say, “This is our conditioning.” It’s not.

00:10:43.997 --> 00:10:46.418
But this is what you have gathered in this lifetime.

00:10:46.554 --> 00:10:50.045
It has nothing to do with your previous lives or anything,

00:10:50.054 --> 00:10:51.551
nothing to do with your bhoots.

00:10:51.583 --> 00:10:54.935
Now there’s one common thing in the West (which) is, “This is my bhoot!”

00:10:54.944 --> 00:11:00.063
As if to have a bhoot is a very big honour!

00:11:00.102 --> 00:11:01.563
In India nobody would say that,

00:11:01.613 --> 00:11:03.664
nobody would accept they have a bhoot.

00:11:03.673 --> 00:11:06.434
Because to say you have a bhoot means you are a nonsensical person.

00:11:06.443 --> 00:11:08.014
How could you have a bhoot?

00:11:08.023 --> 00:11:09.984
That means there is something definitely wrong with you,

00:11:09.993 --> 00:11:14.044
you are a weak person, there’s something missing in you.

00:11:14.115 --> 00:11:18.663
So one has to understand the attitude towards life is to be like this

00:11:18.687 --> 00:11:24.953
that you give others joy, not find faults with others.

00:11:25.035 --> 00:11:30.426
This attitude has to be completely changed, of finding faults with others.

00:11:30.435 --> 00:11:34.226
Now, finding faults with yourself is also not necessary,

00:11:34.235 --> 00:11:36.356
because every day you are changing,

00:11:36.365 --> 00:11:40.596
every day you are blossoming, every day you are evolving.

00:11:40.605 --> 00:11:44.456
So it doesn’t help to find faults with yourself.

00:11:44.465 --> 00:11:48.236
Like many people tell me that,

00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:50.921
“Mother, you know, I am a very miserable creature

00:11:50.937 --> 00:11:56.596
and I don’t know what to do with myself and this and that.

00:11:56.605 --> 00:11:57.996
And I have been always like this.

00:11:58.005 --> 00:12:02.286
I have been always an unhappy person.”

00:12:02.295 --> 00:12:05.496
What is the need to be like that?

00:12:05.505 --> 00:12:07.646
If you have been like this you have been a stupid fool!

00:12:07.655 --> 00:12:11.396
That’s what you have been.

00:12:11.405 --> 00:12:13.338
By God’s grace you have everything:

00:12:13.361 --> 00:12:14.872
what is there to be miserable like that?

00:12:14.905 --> 00:12:16.780
“From my childhood I have been like this.” So what?

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:21.596
If you have been from childhood you have been a stupid fool, that’s what.

00:12:21.605 --> 00:12:29.863
It doesn’t give you a better place in society if you say, “it is from my childhood.”

00:12:29.941 --> 00:12:33.577
Get rid of it!

00:12:33.617 --> 00:12:37.848
So complaining like this all the time that,

00:12:37.929 --> 00:12:42.710
“You see, I’m good for nothing. I’m a failure. I cannot fit into this.”

00:12:42.775 --> 00:12:44.133
We have no norms I have told you.

00:12:44.164 --> 00:12:46.172
We have no norms.

00:12:46.225 --> 00:12:48.486
We have no systems.

00:12:48.519 --> 00:12:53.370
It’s nothing like it should be a Georgian house or it should be a Victorian house

00:12:53.435 --> 00:12:55.416
and if it is not then it is fussy;

00:12:55.425 --> 00:12:58.594
that’s not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:58.645 --> 00:13:04.066
There’s no pattern set for Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:04.115 --> 00:13:07.406
But what is set is that you are the Spirit.

00:13:07.455 --> 00:13:09.346
You are free people.

00:13:09.355 --> 00:13:11.406
You are yogis.

00:13:11.415 --> 00:13:13.346
You are kings.

00:13:13.355 --> 00:13:18.293
Not like these modern kings where even their dress is decided by parliament.

00:13:18.347 --> 00:13:20.128
You are free.

00:13:20.177 --> 00:13:24.596
You are free people; free people to understand

00:13:24.639 --> 00:13:29.173
what makes you happy and what makes others happy.

00:13:29.277 --> 00:13:31.188
So respect the freedom of others.

00:13:31.237 --> 00:13:34.568
To be overpowering on someone, to all the time say,

00:13:34.625 --> 00:13:41.952
“Oh this is it!” asking hundred questions - not necessary.

00:13:42.037 --> 00:13:45.818
I have seen myself people torture me like this.

00:13:45.842 --> 00:13:49.960
Like I went to a place and there’s a lady who comes to look after me.

00:13:50.007 --> 00:13:51.904
Very sophisticated she is.

00:13:51.945 --> 00:13:55.919
So she’ll ask me, “Mother, will you sleep on the right side or the left side?”

00:13:55.973 --> 00:14:00.069
I said, “I don’t know! Why is it necessary?”

00:14:00.145 --> 00:14:03.236
“No, I would like to know which side I should place the lamp.”

00:14:03.245 --> 00:14:08.489
I said, “Whichever side you place I can turn round and put it on!”

00:14:08.592 --> 00:14:13.568
Then she’ll ask, “Which hand you use for the soap?”

00:14:13.607 --> 00:14:16.417
I said, “Whichever is needed! What is so great?”

00:14:16.528 --> 00:14:18.671
She said, “But then I should have put it on the left or the right?”

00:14:18.726 --> 00:14:21.197
I mean, I am not a machine that I go to the left only!

00:14:21.317 --> 00:14:25.993
I can go to the right as well!

00:14:26.143 --> 00:14:27.502
And she pestered my life;

00:14:27.546 --> 00:14:31.727
I told her that, “Please, will you please now do not make me into a computer.

00:14:31.752 --> 00:14:34.423
Will you please go and leave me alone.

00:14:34.496 --> 00:14:35.765
I can manage myself.”

00:14:35.794 --> 00:14:38.045
So this kind of a system we don’t have.

00:14:38.094 --> 00:14:42.152
We are not to computerize ourselves.

00:14:42.394 --> 00:14:43.675
We are free people.

00:14:43.739 --> 00:14:46.380
This is one thing we forget: we are free people.

00:14:46.413 --> 00:14:50.112
When we are free we respect the freedom of others

00:14:50.133 --> 00:14:54.414
and we enjoy their freedom as we enjoy our own freedom.

00:14:54.452 --> 00:14:58.653
This is a very important principle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:58.702 --> 00:15:01.279
That you do not put your things onto others.

00:15:01.311 --> 00:15:03.224
Now for example, it’s a very common thing,

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:06.988
“I can see your vibrations, you are very bad.”

00:15:07.062 --> 00:15:08.599
That’s no good.

00:15:08.915 --> 00:15:12.180
If you feel somebody’s vibrations are bad or anything

00:15:12.239 --> 00:15:15.013
try to be away from that person, it’s different.

00:15:15.064 --> 00:15:19.645
But you need not say that to them because that hurts the personality of that person,

00:15:19.691 --> 00:15:23.937
that person feels hurt and then that person goes to another person and say

00:15:23.955 --> 00:15:27.391
that, “Alright. I can see the vibrations. You have very bad vibrations.”

00:15:27.434 --> 00:15:29.653
Then he will say to the dog, he’ll say to anything ….

00:15:29.765 --> 00:15:33.264
That’s not the way the make it cheap like that.

00:15:33.375 --> 00:15:41.926
You shouldn’t talk for vibrations so cheaply.

00:15:42.014 --> 00:15:43.355
“Let me see your vibrations.”

00:15:43.399 --> 00:15:48.150
You are not to judge other’s vibrations better judge yours.

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:51.421
Have you understood your own vibrations?

00:15:51.502 --> 00:15:53.613
Have you corrected yourself?

00:15:53.662 --> 00:15:55.703
But that doesn’t mean, again, you condemn yourself,

00:15:55.777 --> 00:15:59.168
“Mother, I’ve been catching throughout my Left Agnya, what to do.”

00:15:59.217 --> 00:16:02.338
Why don’t you get rid of it? It’s very simple.

00:16:02.418 --> 00:16:04.413
Left Agnya is the easiest thing to get rid of.

00:16:04.447 --> 00:16:06.628
You know the mantras, you know what to do

00:16:06.749 --> 00:16:08.840
then get rid of it.But, no, you see ….

00:16:08.896 --> 00:16:12.087
That’s a kind of an indulgence also some people have,

00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:13.884
“Oh, I’ve got a Left Agnya.”

00:16:13.981 --> 00:16:17.852
Then everybody should worry about that person, sympathize with that person,

00:16:17.893 --> 00:16:25.727
bring candle, burn his clothes, burn him, burn everything.

00:16:25.815 --> 00:16:30.505
And then they start crying, “Oh, God, what is this.”

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:45.481
This is the habit which has come from history I should say,

00:16:45.561 --> 00:16:49.812
that we have had parents like this, we might have had grandparents like this,

00:16:49.861 --> 00:16:54.962
we must have had someone like that and also now we are following their footsteps.

00:16:55.105 --> 00:16:58.121
And might be we must have read some novels of that kind

00:16:58.192 --> 00:17:00.712
where we must have seen some people are all the time miserable

00:17:00.752 --> 00:17:02.350
and we want to be miserable like them.

00:17:02.478 --> 00:17:05.062
We might be just trying to become like them,

00:17:05.103 --> 00:17:10.762
it’s just a miserable creature because I read in a novel that such and such person,

00:17:10.823 --> 00:17:14.804
like in Wuthering Heights, somebody was a very unhappy person

00:17:14.813 --> 00:17:16.249
so I’m becoming like that.

00:17:16.328 --> 00:17:19.484
Now you are not in the times of Wuthering Heights now

00:17:19.493 --> 00:17:21.994
nor anybody is writing about you, nothing.

00:17:22.003 --> 00:17:26.714
You are a normal Sahaja Yogi.

00:17:26.723 --> 00:17:28.600
These are all abnormal characters

00:17:28.664 --> 00:17:33.724
which have been painted just for you to see these are abnormal characters.

00:17:33.733 --> 00:17:37.893
Now immediately you become identified.

00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:41.971
So all these identifications are justifications

00:17:42.123 --> 00:17:46.304
and it’s nothing but a means of troubling others, that’s all.

00:17:46.313 --> 00:17:48.884
They are so boring, such people are extremely boring.

00:17:48.893 --> 00:17:50.385
You don’t like them really.

00:17:50.408 --> 00:17:52.290
People just shun away from them because

00:17:52.315 --> 00:17:58.076
they think these people are all the time bothering us with their own personal nonsensical things

00:17:58.093 --> 00:18:01.716
or some sort of an identification they have or they read some book -

00:18:01.756 --> 00:18:03.784
immediately they become that.

00:18:03.793 --> 00:18:05.621
How can you become like that?

00:18:05.637 --> 00:18:12.780
Why can’t you become the Spirit which you are?

00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:19.436
All these misconceptions, misidentifications, misappropriations are to be given up.

00:18:19.484 --> 00:18:20.805
We have to take to reality.

00:18:20.814 --> 00:18:30.325
We have to take to truth and truth is joy giving.

00:18:30.334 --> 00:18:33.902
Now the word, as I said, “problem” is a recent word in the English language,

00:18:33.934 --> 00:18:35.485
they never had it before, I tell you.

00:18:35.494 --> 00:18:38.025
In geometry only we used to learn when I was young.

00:18:38.034 --> 00:18:39.875
In geometry only there was a problem.

00:18:39.884 --> 00:18:45.785
We never had a problem otherwise.

00:18:45.794 --> 00:18:46.995
Now there is problem.

00:18:47.004 --> 00:18:51.469
This is not a thing one can eat, this can be soaked.

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.125
Who brought this one? This is too much.

00:18:57.134 --> 00:18:59.063
They expect me to eat this, eh.

00:18:59.102 --> 00:19:01.515
Rather too much.

00:19:01.524 --> 00:19:10.964
Hard bhoots, I must say.

00:19:11.034 --> 00:19:17.785
So when we laugh we should laugh aloud, open, we are free people.

00:19:17.914 --> 00:19:23.675
Now there should not be a laughter which is signed by some Elvis Presley or someone

00:19:23.684 --> 00:19:32.015
that, “You should smile like this: only two teeth must be seen” and this and that.

00:19:32.024 --> 00:19:36.345
That’s not for Sahaja Yogis.

00:19:36.354 --> 00:19:41.845
They are mukt (liberated), they laugh, they smile the way they like.

00:19:41.854 --> 00:19:44.735
But what I find is so many people, you see, just to show me

00:19:44.744 --> 00:19:47.552
that they are very happy are just grinning at me, like this.

00:19:47.598 --> 00:19:48.988
I said, “What’s this?

00:19:49.092 --> 00:19:52.643
Is a bhoot grinning or you are grinning at me? Which one is?”

00:19:52.804 --> 00:19:57.895
So, you see, it’s a natural spontaneous bubbling joy

00:19:57.904 --> 00:20:01.245
that should be seen on the faces of Sahaja Yogis.

00:20:01.254 --> 00:20:06.045
Now if you want to take, say a simple example I’ll tell you.

00:20:06.054 --> 00:20:13.735
I went one day climbing up a very high hill with my son-in-law and daughter.

00:20:13.744 --> 00:20:15.355
And there was a big temple there

00:20:15.364 --> 00:20:17.725
so we had to go there.It’s called as Palitana.

00:20:17.734 --> 00:20:22.675
And by the time you go there you really get absolutely sick

00:20:22.684 --> 00:20:24.617
because three miles you have to walk and go up.

00:20:24.728 --> 00:20:27.768
We went and set down, the hot (UNCLEAR) so we set down.

00:20:27.818 --> 00:20:34.949
And then suddenly I saw all the beautiful elephants they have made in the stone

00:20:35.014 --> 00:20:38.262
and every elephant has a different type of a tail twisted.

00:20:38.421 --> 00:20:41.437
When my son-in-law and my daughter were absolutely spread,

00:20:41.491 --> 00:20:47.432
both were fed up and they were sitting there somehow waiting for the water to come in

00:20:47.671 --> 00:20:50.575
and I said, “Look at these elephants. See how they’ve done it.

00:20:50.644 --> 00:20:53.035
Every tail is differently twisted.”

00:20:53.155 --> 00:20:55.257
They said, “Mommy, this is really ….

00:20:55.315 --> 00:20:58.776
At this time how can you see the tails of the elephants?”

00:20:58.904 --> 00:21:01.515
I said, “This is what I see because I just now ….

00:21:01.538 --> 00:21:09.229
There is no water so better to see the tails of the elephants.”

00:21:09.318 --> 00:21:14.829
And that’s how you feel better, you feel younger, you feel happier,

00:21:14.869 --> 00:21:19.900
you feel dynamic, you can do ten things without bothering.

00:21:19.932 --> 00:21:23.248
But it’s the human nature I think to show off

00:21:23.335 --> 00:21:29.655
that you are extremely unhappy to gain some sort of sympathy.

00:21:29.664 --> 00:21:34.260
That little work you will do and ten times you will tell

00:21:34.335 --> 00:21:40.736
that, “Oh, God, I went down to the shop and then I climbed up,

00:21:40.784 --> 00:21:46.575
and then I went to the counter, and then I bought this,

00:21:46.624 --> 00:21:49.715
and then I had to pay the money.Then I had to …”

00:21:49.756 --> 00:21:58.737
(Laugh explosion from the children and Shri Mataji.)

00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:04.310
Look at the children, that’s what it is.

00:22:04.439 --> 00:22:07.620
Children are enjoying this because they know they do it like this,

00:22:07.685 --> 00:22:12.058
all these nonsensical things should not be done at all.

00:22:12.120 --> 00:22:15.344
It has to be a very simple joyous state.

00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:18.470
It should be said, “You have brought something. That’s alright.”

00:22:18.502 --> 00:22:20.518
Eat it nicely, happily.

00:22:20.581 --> 00:22:22.581
You don’t have to say, “I did this.”

00:22:22.625 --> 00:22:25.856
Better not give but keep it with you, it’s like that.

00:22:26.191 --> 00:22:32.232
So every time I’m going I have to give you some sort of a message

00:22:32.275 --> 00:22:35.826
and this time is that you enjoy yourself.

00:22:35.882 --> 00:22:39.070
Every time I say this, “Enjoy yourself.”

00:22:39.466 --> 00:22:43.253
I hope you understand why I say that.It’s a mantra.

00:22:43.279 --> 00:22:49.940
There is a mantra today that “enjoy yourself”, your Self, your Spirit.

00:22:49.996 --> 00:22:53.483
Enjoy your Spirit in Nirananda.

00:22:53.896 --> 00:22:56.015
You should drench yourself in that.

00:22:56.047 --> 00:22:59.518
You’ll be surprised all so-called problems, all so-called pressures,

00:22:59.599 --> 00:23:01.710
all these things just will die out.

00:23:01.719 --> 00:23:05.980
It’s only your mental conception, your mental ideas and the forms

00:23:05.989 --> 00:23:09.210
and systems from which you are coming out, that’s why.

00:23:09.219 --> 00:23:12.390
You have certain ideas about people which are not truth.

00:23:12.399 --> 00:23:15.090
They are all evolving, they are all coming out of it.

00:23:15.099 --> 00:23:20.650
Even the societies which are not Sahaja Yogis are changing around you.

00:23:20.659 --> 00:23:23.440
You are the ones who are changing all this.

00:23:23.449 --> 00:23:28.300
You see, like a little child, one little child and he runs - he makes you so happy.

00:23:28.309 --> 00:23:31.640
That’s is sufficient to make you happy.

00:23:31.649 --> 00:23:34.800
In the same way so many Sahaja Yogis in England

00:23:34.809 --> 00:23:37.790
should change the society of England, no doubt.

00:23:37.799 --> 00:23:42.110
But let us see how much we have transformed, how much dynamism we have.

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:45.290
Now, I have no problem, as usual.

00:23:45.299 --> 00:23:50.850
But there is one thing that you could call a problem for England - the Shudy Camp.

00:23:50.859 --> 00:23:54.710
Now Shudy Camp to become Shudy Camp needs people to work it out.

00:23:54.719 --> 00:23:58.568
But those people who have some talent should go, everybody for a picnic.

00:23:58.647 --> 00:24:00.584
Still it is not ready for picnic.

00:24:00.633 --> 00:24:02.374
It is ready for some work,

00:24:02.439 --> 00:24:07.246
people who want to go should enlist their names with Gavin or someone.

00:24:07.285 --> 00:24:10.590
Or I think Dr. Spyro can look after that side.

00:24:10.599 --> 00:24:13.830
And you inform them that, “We would like to go.”

00:24:13.839 --> 00:24:17.480
and “We can do this work.” Go there and work it out.

00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:25.080
And I’m sure it will be ready very soon for us to have picnics.

00:24:25.089 --> 00:24:31.120
But before having picnics we have to work and working is same as a picnic.

00:24:31.129 --> 00:24:33.688
Working is same to a picnic if you know how to enjoy it.

00:24:33.713 --> 00:24:37.424
Everything is picnic, everything is enjoyment.

00:24:37.457 --> 00:24:43.379
Nothing is a pressure for your, nothing is a dull thing for you,

00:24:43.438 --> 00:24:44.979
nothing of the kind.

00:24:45.099 --> 00:24:49.570
So you are the ones who can make the whole country very joyous

00:24:49.579 --> 00:24:51.640
and the whole world very joyous.

00:24:51.649 --> 00:24:56.649
May God bless you.
