1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:14,160
Now if you have left Agnya, that means there’s 
possession on it.

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,249
That means all of you have got something of 
that kind, already you’re caught up, you’re

3
00:00:15,249 --> 00:00:16,249
not clean.

4
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:17,249
What is the mantra for this, Gavin?

5
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:18,249
For the back Agnya, Mahaganesh.

6
00:00:18,249 --> 00:00:19,249
Mahaganesh, Mahabhairava, correct.

7
00:00:19,249 --> 00:00:20,849
Now see, in the brain you’ve got all these 
seeds of the gods and they are the seeds because

8
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:22,070
they’re the causal of these.

9
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:37,830
So the first, the causal is created and then 
the deities are created.

10
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,750
So, for example, causal of the Mother Earth 
is fragrance, all right.

11
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,040
So from fragrance comes the Mother Earth.

12
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,450
In the same way the causal of Brahmadeva is 
Hiranyagarbha, all right?

13
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,000
He’s called as Hiranyagarbha.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,430
He’s the causal of Brahmadeva.

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:04,640
Where does he stay in the brain?

16
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:18,829
In the brain of the Virata whatever deities 
leave are the causal and manas also, because

17
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,600
they’re reflected.

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:33,909
So the causal ones are here in our brain, 
in our brain, in our brain.

19
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:48,979
At the back here, around the Agnya, now I 
give you the name, no, around the Agnya.

20
00:01:48,979 --> 00:02:03,520
Agnya is Mahaganesha and Mahabhairava, Agnya, 
at the back.

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:09,220
And in front…

22
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:24,450
At the back is actually Mahaganesha, just 
in the center.

23
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,450
Just in the central point is Mahaganesha.

24
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:26,450
This is the minutest point.

25
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,450
Around him moves Mahabhairava, all right?

26
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,620
And around this, the rest of it that moves 
is Hiranyagarbha, all right?

27
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,450
Now did you follow that?

28
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:51,520
So when you think, or whatever thinking you 
do, through this superego, through this superego,

29
00:02:51,520 --> 00:03:08,380
you get the development of this Hiranyagarbha.

30
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:12,090
Did you follow that?

31
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:16,710
And also otherwise, is also, who acts when 
you think?

32
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,350
Is Hiranyagarbha.

33
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:37,830
This is Swadisthana, we call it, this is Swadisthana 
chakra around it, all right?

34
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:49,710
Now, so Swadisthana is divided into left and 
right.

35
00:03:49,710 --> 00:04:10,820
Left Swadisthana is Hiranyagarbha and right 
Swadisthana is also Hiranyagarbha, at the

36
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,820
back here.

37
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,180
So now to point out first of all, at the back, 
if you move, is Mahaganesha.

38
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,540
Around him moves Bhairava, who protects Mahaganesha.

39
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:21,800
Around it moves, now moves Hiranyagarbha, 
at the back.

40
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:41,560
But Hiranyagarbha has left and right side 
while Bhairava and Ganesha, they move on each

41
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,120
other.

42
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,770
Did you follow that point?

43
00:04:46,770 --> 00:05:07,400
Now in front, in the center here, is who?

44
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:27,420
Kartikeya, in the center; Christ is in the 
center, in the center itself where the optic

45
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:30,070
chiasma is.

46
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:35,370
Here outside is Kartikeya.

47
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:39,350
What is Kartikeya?

48
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:49,740
Kartikeya is the protector of Christ.

49
00:05:49,740 --> 00:06:12,260
Around Kartikeya, they’re all protectors 
of Christ, moves who?

50
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,770
Now who is Mahabhairava’s counterpart?

51
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,460
Mahahanumana, Mahahanumana, all right?

52
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:17,990
And around that, what does move?

53
00:06:17,990 --> 00:06:18,990
Ekadasha Rudra.

54
00:06:18,990 --> 00:06:40,210
The movement of Ekadasha Rudra is not circular, 
doesn’t move like that.

55
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:47,990
It moves like that.

56
00:06:47,990 --> 00:07:01,590
Or you can say, move like that.

57
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,110
Now what is Ekadasha Rudra?

58
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:07,350
Let us see.

59
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:13,670
Can you give the names?

60
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:16,030
Of Ekadasha.

61
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:20,750
Take one by one.

62
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:23,100
Buddha, right?

63
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,280
Mahavira.

64
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:29,000
Then Christ, then Mahabhairava.

65
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,889
How many of them, four.

66
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,430
Then Mahaganesha, five.

67
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:43,139
Did I say Bhairava?

68
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:57,290
Again, again say it one by one, Buddha, Mahavira, 
Christ, Mahaganesha, Mahabhairava.

69
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:20,240
All right, this is very clear cut for you 
because just now I’ve told all of them.

70
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,050
Buddha, Mahavira, Christ.

71
00:08:25,050 --> 00:08:33,950
Then, what else, four are left, four are still 
left.

72
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,560
Mahahanumana, you didn’t tell?

73
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,479
Mahahanumana, how much it is now?

74
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:46,010
Three left, no four are left, four, now what 
are these four?

75
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,310
Say, it’s very simple.

76
00:08:47,310 --> 00:09:00,589
Just now

77
00:09:00,589 --> 00:09:05,650
I discussed with you Mahahanumana, Mahabhairava, 
two, Buddha, Mahavira.

78
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,860
Four, now, Kartikeya.

79
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:10,080
Kartikeya, Ganesha, sixth.

80
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,560
Christ, seventh.

81
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:31,670
Now four more are left, now who are the four 
more, let’s see, can I have it?

82
00:09:31,670 --> 00:09:37,270
Pat, come along.

83
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:44,180
You’ve done lot of reading.

84
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:57,210
They have written it down into something, 
eleven of these.

85
00:09:57,210 --> 00:10:01,120
Brahmadeva, Hiranyagarbha, correct.

86
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:11,540
Vishnu, Narayana, Lakshmi Narayana, how much 
it is.

87
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:15,450
Shiva, Parvati, everyone.

88
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:21,960
Shiva and Shakti, all right?

89
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:25,870
Eleven of them.

90
00:10:25,870 --> 00:10:34,000
Lakshmi Narayana is one, Brahmadeva Saraswati 
is back, Shiva Parvati has…

91
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,760
All eleven are there.

92
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,520
Why Shiva and Parvati?

93
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:55,370
Two have to be taken because Shiva is the 
Guru, Parvati is the Shakti.

94
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:58,000
So if you catch on void, the beginning of 
the trouble starts because Shiva is the central

95
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
path.

96
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,110
There Shiva is to be taken as Guru, Shiva 
is Guru, Shiva is the one who is our Guru.

97
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,110
He is our spirit.

98
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:03,590
But he’s not the spirit that protects because 
spirit needs no protection.

99
00:11:03,590 --> 00:11:05,510
Whom do you protect then, also.

100
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:12,070
So when you protect, you protect the spirit 
but what protects it is the Guru personality

101
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:14,940
which is Shiva, which is Shiva actually.

102
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:16,580
Did you get that?

103
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Now you might say how is Shiva is “Guru 
Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devom, Maheshwara,

104
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
Guru Sakshat, Parabrahma, Tasmai Shri Guruveh 
Namah.”

105
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,580
Because Guru means a person who is full of 
Gurutwakashan, is weight, is the gravity.

106
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,530
Person who is with gravity, which has some 
sense, which is density, which is our spirit.

107
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:22,530
Otherwise we have no density, we’re useless.

108
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:23,950
Our spirit goes away, we float in the air.

109
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:34,050
So the Guru is everything.

110
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:51,010
Today I’ve called you here to tell you how 
to become a Guru.

111
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:58,770
So that’s why I’ve given you this introduction.

112
00:11:58,770 --> 00:11:59,770
Is it clear to you?

113
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:00,770
All right let Me know now…

114
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:01,770
(Apparent break in recording here)

115
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:02,770
See that? , just laugh at yourself; see that? 
, just laugh at yourself.

116
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:03,770
With all your knowledge of how many years 
I’ve been talking to you, look at this,

117
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:04,770
this is the point.

118
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:05,770
How Mother raising… just given just like 
that, do I tell you something.

119
00:12:05,770 --> 00:12:08,620
You all have gone to the wrong gurus, you 
have done, because… , nothing of the kind.

120
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,620
Just because you’re all kept here, it’s 
the Ekadasha Rudra on your forehead, it’s

121
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,620
to bow before any wrong guru.

122
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,620
With that your Ekadasha Rudra…

123
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,620
Sahaja Yoga is very simple you know.

124
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,620
If you put your glass upside down , if you 
put it like this . Sahaja Yoga is so simple,

125
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,620
do you follow that point?

126
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,070
So we reach one conclusion, by mental understanding 
you cannot understand Sahaja Yoga.

127
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:32,750
So as a guru what could you have?

128
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:40,020
I’ve made a promise.

129
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:44,420
That’s different.

130
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:57,640
You are telling like this, if I say that, 
“What is the sense of, say, guru?”

131
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:02,490
Do you say that it should not become artificial?

132
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,250
Now let’s see again quite straight forward, 
what is the question?

133
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:13,140
No, no, what is the question?

134
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:29,020
Now try to remember.

135
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:50,120
What should we have?

136
00:13:50,120 --> 00:14:27,060
What is the question, let’s see exactly.

137
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,340
Exactly.

138
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:48,170
How do you…

139
00:14:48,170 --> 00:16:06,709
This is another question but the question 
I asked is: then what must a guru do?

140
00:16:06,709 --> 00:16:15,583
The thing I said, by discussion Sahaja Yoga 
doesn’t work out then what should we do?

141
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,583
I asked the question what should we do?

142
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,583
Make it simple always related to your Mother, 
you’ll get the answer.

143
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:18,583
Hah!

144
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:19,583
All right?

145
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:51,020
To neutralize the old guru who has been a 
bad guru you have to surrender to the real

146
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,230
guru.

147
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:36,620
If your guru is the real guru then you surrender 
to the Mother of your real guru.

148
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:45,010
Because your real guru is also surrendered 
to Me.

149
00:17:45,010 --> 00:17:58,059
So all gurus are to be surrendered at the 
lotus feet of your Mother.

150
00:17:58,059 --> 00:17:59,331
Then if it is Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, Shiva, 
Krishna, Christ, anyone of them also, Ekadasha

151
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:00,331
still is more than your Mother’s.

152
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,331
It is very difficult because we want to stick 
on to something, even the real guru.

153
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:09,169
Christ is a real guru but the Christ you know 
of is to be also surrendered at the lotus

154
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:17,520
feet of your Mother because we also know that.

155
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,429
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, all of them are My 
servants.

156
00:18:20,429 --> 00:18:22,799
Adi Shakti is the Mother.

157
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:59,480
She’s the Mother of all the gurus, of all 
the prophets, of all the incarnations, of

158
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:26,989
all the . After Her, only Parabrahma is created, 
after that only Parabrahma.

159
00:19:26,989 --> 00:20:09,610
So when you have got someone like that to 
surrender, is a maya.

160
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,610
That is the biggest problem because you’ve 
got somebody so easily.

161
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:12,610
Arjuna was a great warrior till the war started, 
and somebody was a great swimmer when he came

162
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:13,610
to the ocean.

163
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:14,610
Allow your mind to do the work, allow your 
mind.

164
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:15,610
So to be the highest guru we’ve to be completely 
surrendered.

165
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:16,610
Now when you’re surrendered, you don’t 
doubt.

166
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:17,610
For Me this finger is completely surrendered, 
say, to My body, it doesn’t doubt My body.

167
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:18,610
Supposing I’m pressing and it receives the 
information that you’re doing that he informs

168
00:20:18,610 --> 00:20:19,610
the brain and informs the body that I’m 
doing that.

169
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:57,289
It says some thing must be done to remove 
it, the whole body acts, all the fingers act

170
00:20:57,289 --> 00:21:05,520
and all the power flows there, the energy 
flows there where the finger is hurt.

171
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:15,320
So when you are surrendered there is no question 
of individualism.

172
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:49,460
Those people who think of any kind of individualism 
are going to go out of the circulation of.

173
00:21:49,460 --> 00:22:00,129
From the beginning, I’ve told you many a 
time if we take out all those people who want

174
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:01,700
to assert their individualism of any kind.

175
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:18,220
You see, this is a branch, all right, you 
can see here.

176
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:26,919
In the last stage, I use the same analogy 
better and better.

177
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:35,100
Outside is the same, all right?

178
00:22:35,100 --> 00:23:08,480
If inside and outside is the same and the 
rest is . If this has to become this, what

179
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:17,860
has to . This myth has to go, all right?

180
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:23,080
This myth has to vanish.

181
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:35,580
So this myth is made from what, our ego and 
superego only.

182
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:54,279
These are actually the end result of all the 
nonsense we have been.

183
00:23:54,279 --> 00:24:12,769
In a sense, all this has to go, vanish, it 
doesn’t exist at all, that is .

184
00:24:12,769 --> 00:24:22,349
In a way you cannot be a guru unless and until 
, you are open to it, that’s coming and

185
00:24:22,349 --> 00:24:23,690
going, but supposing you’re like this.

186
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:27,259
To be like the story I heard in India that 
there was a , three of them.

187
00:24:27,259 --> 00:24:29,470
They went inside the to have something.

188
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:38,179
They sat down on a table and they saw a flask 
put like this.

189
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:50,679
They said, “What sort of a flask is this, 
it has no mouth.”

190
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:56,529
So they called the bearer and said, “See 
we can’t have food unless and until it has

191
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:57,529
a mouth, take it back.”

192
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,529
They said, “What sort of a glass is this, 
it has no water?”

193
00:24:58,529 --> 00:24:59,529
Because . But when you’re surrendered the 
mouth and bottom is , luckily its…

194
00:24:59,529 --> 00:25:00,529
That surrendering is to be achieved if you’re 
going to be .

195
00:25:00,529 --> 00:25:01,529
This is all mental, how do you . Have a bandhan.

196
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:02,529
How many times you give yourself bandhan?

197
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:03,529
Before sleeping, after getting up, then namaskar 
to your Mother, , touching My feet, very important,

198
00:25:03,529 --> 00:25:04,529
not to come on to the Agnya, supposed to correct.

199
00:25:04,529 --> 00:25:05,529
Even sitting down there I’m catching, . Then 
again put on both the feet, again you try.

200
00:25:05,529 --> 00:25:06,529
First right and then left.

201
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:07,529
Ah!

202
00:25:07,529 --> 00:25:08,529
See now.

203
00:25:08,529 --> 00:25:09,529
It’s not mental, this is the point I’m 
bringing you.

204
00:25:09,529 --> 00:25:09,536
It is not mental, now this is.
