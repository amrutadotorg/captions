18:13.925 --> 18:18.531
I am sorry I had to talk in Hindi because
most of them are Hindi-knowing people

18:18.556 --> 18:21.471
and I've just told them what is
the importance of Bombay,

18:21.496 --> 18:28.294
and why so many incarnations came here,
and why Shri Rama

18:28.319 --> 18:35.244
had to walk in the villages and the hills
and dales of Maharashtra,

18:35.276 --> 18:43.604
what was the need, and the need is that
they should all develop their Sahaja Yoga.

18:43.629 --> 18:48.977
Also, this would be the last Puja
for all of you, in India.

18:49.002 --> 18:52.644
I hope you all have gained a lot
in these different Pujas

18:52.669 --> 18:57.722
and different places we have been to.

18:58.237 --> 19:03.142
Only thing is that one should remember
that Krita Yuga has started.

19:03.175 --> 19:07.325
Now Kali Yuga is over, Krita Yuga
has started, and in this Yuga

19:07.350 --> 19:14.603
- that the Paramchaitanya is absolutely
effective and very efficient.

19:14.628 --> 19:19.850
Now if you do anything wrong it will
punish you.

19:19.875 --> 19:23.786
It may not punish immediately but it
will give you a suggestion,

19:23.811 --> 19:28.680
it will give you a proper signal that
something is going wrong with you.

19:28.705 --> 19:33.806
But if you do not try to control your
footsteps then you may go down very fast.

19:33.831 --> 19:36.612
So you have to be very careful about that.

19:36.637 --> 19:40.074
Actually, I have told you so many times
that there are two forces working,

19:40.099 --> 19:42.928
one which attracts you inside and one
which throws you out.

19:42.953 --> 19:49.935
So it is important for all of us,
all of us to remember

19:49.960 --> 19:54.975
that this Krita Yuga is there, and in that
this Paramchaitanya is overactive.

19:54.975 --> 19:58.948
Also, you are rewarded. You have been
telling me so many stories,

19:58.973 --> 20:02.432
how sahaj it worked out, how sahaj
it has happened,

20:02.457 --> 20:05.912
all of you have been telling Me very
nice stories.

20:05.937 --> 20:14.113
But it is part of your play in Sahaja Yoga

20:14.138 --> 20:17.045
and that you are placed in the kingdom
of God.

20:17.070 --> 20:21.394
So, in the kingdom of God you are there,
try to enjoy it,

20:21.419 --> 20:24.734
that's the only thing you have to do
is to enjoy the kingdom of God.

20:24.759 --> 20:30.426
But if you try to, sort of, dislocate
yourself from this joy,

20:30.451 --> 20:37.501
break the connection of joy by some sort
of thinking, which is not reality,

20:37.526 --> 20:40.349
then you are responsible for yourself.

20:40.374 --> 20:44.413
So, I have to tell you that keep
the connection on. Not only that,

20:44.438 --> 20:51.481
but try to make it stronger and stronger,
and become one with that divine force

20:51.506 --> 20:55.860
permanently, which will flow through you
and will not only enlighten you

20:55.885 --> 21:02.398
but will give you so many powers, and you
will see the new life in this new year.

21:02.423 --> 21:05.658
Yesterday, as I requested you, we have
to work it out now.

21:05.683 --> 21:10.554
Individually, we have to go all out to see
that we spread Sahaja Yoga

21:10.579 --> 21:15.285
and talk about it. On this day I give you
complete freedom

21:15.310 --> 21:19.803
to do what you like to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You need not ask Me any permissions,

21:19.828 --> 21:24.180
and you can try everything that you
want to. But should be something decent,

21:24.205 --> 21:28.329
should not be something indecent
and something which is not behoving

21:28.354 --> 21:34.052
a sahaja yogi. Even if you have to write
letters or answers or anything,

21:34.077 --> 21:36.749
even if you have to show the anger
it should be done

21:36.774 --> 21:41.205
in a very decent and a beautiful
manner.

21:41.230 --> 21:46.360
And it should show that it's a yogi
who is talking.

21:46.385 --> 21:53.539
The other things, whatever problems
you have, will be solved in no time.

21:53.564 --> 21:58.948
But the main problem is yourself, it should
be solved by you by meditative methods.

21:58.973 --> 22:05.975
And so much attention we are paying
to all our extra-curricular activities

22:06.000 --> 22:09.971
but that will definitely fail, it will
boomerang on you

22:09.996 --> 22:12.889
if you do not have the foundation
of Sahaja Yoga.

22:12.914 --> 22:17.862
It is very important to keep attention
on your spirit all the time

22:17.887 --> 22:21.484
so that whatever you are doing, whatever
you are projecting,

22:21.509 --> 22:25.931
has the base and you just don't get lost.
This is a very important thing,

22:25.956 --> 22:33.767
and I am sure that you will understand
that without the nourishment

22:33.792 --> 22:39.939
from the roots you cannot grow. So this
nourishment must be kept alive.

22:39.964 --> 22:43.564
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
