00:00:04.252 --> 00:00:06.984
Today we are going to perform

00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:15.485
a Puja in a place close to Bombay.

00:00:19.542 --> 00:00:24.254
The name of Bombay used to be Mumbai.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:27.320
This name is made of three words:

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.788
Mum, Amba, and Aayee.

00:00:35.227 --> 00:00:41.303
In Maharashtriyan or Marathi language we address Mother as Aayee.

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:45.857
Even in the Vedas, Adi Shakti is referred to as Ee.

00:00:46.058 --> 00:00:54.809
So, the reflection of Adi Shakti is Aayee.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.521
That is why Mother is called as Aayee.

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:04.624
Also, in many places,

00:01:07.169 --> 00:01:08.761
she is also called as "Ma",

00:01:08.962 --> 00:01:13.126
Therefore the first sound has come from the word "mum".

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.507
And Amba,

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:22.769
as you all know, is verily the Kundalini.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.650
So this Trigunatmika is three words.

00:01:27.031 --> 00:01:29.252
And in Mumbai also, you know that,

00:01:29.453 --> 00:01:35.770
there is a beautiful temple of all the three Shaktis, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati, Mahakali,

00:01:35.971 --> 00:01:41.035
from where these three Devis have emerged from Mother Earth.

00:01:41.996 --> 00:01:47.615
Although, a lot of illicit activities

00:01:47.816 --> 00:01:49.883
are done by people here,

00:01:50.084 --> 00:01:53.603
but still these three Devis are in an awakened state here.

00:01:53.804 --> 00:01:59.893
So, especially the people of Mumbai, should understand

00:02:00.094 --> 00:02:03.560
that these three Devis" swayambhu have not manifested together anywhere else;

00:02:03.761 --> 00:02:08.966
As you already know in Mahurgadh there is Mahasaraswati;

00:02:09.167 --> 00:02:12.577
And in Tuljapur there is Bhavani (Shri Mahakali),

00:02:12.778 --> 00:02:15.262
and in Kolhapur there is Mahalakshmi.

00:02:15.463 --> 00:02:18.582
And in Wani is the half syllable (Ardhmatra),

00:02:18.783 --> 00:02:21.693
whom we call as Adi Shakti.

00:02:21.894 --> 00:02:26.340
But here, all the three Murtis (swayambhu) are awakened.

00:02:27.187 --> 00:02:30.797
But where there is the most hard work done,

00:02:30.998 --> 00:02:35.050
and where the divine work is done the most by chaitanya,

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.333
the purpose of this sometimes

00:02:38.534 --> 00:02:41.864
is that in those places there are very big negativities,

00:02:43.296 --> 00:02:44.787
so

00:02:49.332 --> 00:02:51.533
there is some meaning behind.

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:55.588
And for the destruction of these negative forces

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:59.127
manifestation of such swayambhus takes place.

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:03.897
For example, in the Arabic countries,

00:03:04.098 --> 00:03:06.668
Zoroasther took birth five times,

00:03:06.869 --> 00:03:10.703
and later many Adi Gurus took birth,

00:03:10.904 --> 00:03:12.507
like Abraham, Moses,

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.413
then last of all Mohammed Sahib also took birth there.

00:03:15.614 --> 00:03:17.913
Because it was very much needed,

00:03:18.114 --> 00:03:22.993
that's why these Gurus took birth there and accomplished some work.

00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:26.821
But regarding Mumbai,

00:03:27.022 --> 00:03:28.838
it is said, that the people here

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:32.044
must have lived a life of over abundance, from the beginning.

00:03:32.245 --> 00:03:37.923
There is a story of a boy called Pundarikaksh, Pundaric

00:03:38.124 --> 00:03:42.257
brought his father and mother to Mumbai.

00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:46.184
He was taking his parents on two baskets balanced on a beam,

00:03:46.385 --> 00:03:48.445
to a pilgrimage.

00:03:48.646 --> 00:03:50.738
Both were old.

00:03:51.096 --> 00:03:53.998
And when he was going to the pilgrimage,

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.536
he thought, Mumbai seems to be a nice place,

00:03:58.737 --> 00:04:01.504
so let me rest here for few minutes.

00:04:01.705 --> 00:04:04.824
So, when he stopped there -

00:04:05.025 --> 00:04:09.519
the chaitanya of this place being completely destroyed

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.629
because of the materialistic lifestyle of people -

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.673
He began to think: "Why am I taking my parents on a pilgrimage?

00:04:16.874 --> 00:04:19.924
Why should I do it? What will I gain from this?".

00:04:20.125 --> 00:04:23.266
Because people who are materialistic always think

00:04:23.467 --> 00:04:24.925
what will be their material benefit.

00:04:25.126 --> 00:04:26.568
He thought: "What will I gain?

00:04:26.769 --> 00:04:30.293
My back is already aching. Where shall I take them?".

00:04:30.494 --> 00:04:34.408
So he told his parents that they would have to fend for themselves,

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:38.684
as it was not possible for him to go any further.

00:04:40.206 --> 00:04:43.286
So, the parents began to wonder what was wrong?

00:04:43.487 --> 00:04:46.618
Also, they felt that the vibrations of this city were not good,

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:49.580
So they said, “Alright. We will find our own way,

00:04:49.781 --> 00:04:53.707
but you just take us out of this city Mumbai.

00:04:53.908 --> 00:04:55.826
Take us out of the city,

00:04:56.027 --> 00:04:57.807
and then we will go on our own.

00:04:58.008 --> 00:05:00.593
First, we will just visit Mumbai city,

00:05:00.776 --> 00:05:03.416
then you can take us out".

00:05:04.305 --> 00:05:05.777
He agreed,

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:07.877
thinking that let me leave them out of the city

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:09.924
and then I will have no more headache.

00:05:10.125 --> 00:05:12.975
And then he went to leave them outside of the city.

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:15.509
And when he was on the way to leave them,

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.599
he was feeling tired and he kept thinking

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.579
"What a nuisance I have taken upon myself.

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:24.120
How will I take them till there?

00:05:24.321 --> 00:05:28.111
What's the purpose? And my whole body is in pain and is aching".

00:05:28.869 --> 00:05:32.368
And the moment they were out of the city, he started feeling alright.

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.339
Perhaps, they must have reached Kalwe.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:38.049
Because Kalwe is outside of Mumbai, fortunately!

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.910
But, when he came out,

00:05:43.111 --> 00:05:49.151
he couldn't understand from where he got so much strength and power

00:05:49.352 --> 00:05:51.535
And suddenly he had a change of heart.

00:05:51.736 --> 00:05:53.102
He apologised to his parents,

00:05:53.237 --> 00:05:55.936
and he said: "I do not know from where such thoughts came into my mind.

00:05:56.137 --> 00:05:57.632
Please forgive me".

00:05:57.833 --> 00:06:00.212
I will fulfil my sacred duty

00:06:00.411 --> 00:06:03.454
and I'll take you further on this pilgrimage”.

00:06:03.655 --> 00:06:09.852
And here as you all know, there are two lakes.

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.607
And one's name is...

00:06:16.591 --> 00:06:20.278
One it is called Pampa, Pampa lake,

00:06:20.492 --> 00:06:22.029
as it is described (in the scriptures)

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:26.949
The second one also has been mentioned in the story of Shri Rama.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.556
This means that Shri Rama

00:06:29.757 --> 00:06:33.059
before He went to Dandakaranya, He came to this place,

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.409
and He vibrated the whole Dandakaranya

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.426
by spreading a lot of Chaitanya.

00:06:40.627 --> 00:06:43.894
Besides this, in Maharashtra,

00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:47.803
a lot of work was done and many saints were born.

00:06:48.004 --> 00:06:50.083
And these saints though they were troubled a lot,

00:06:50.284 --> 00:06:52.624
still they kept coming again and again,

00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:56.190
And because of these saints a very great thing happened,

00:06:56.391 --> 00:07:01.076
that people started taking interest in dharma and spirituality.

00:07:01.277 --> 00:07:05.643
But even then, there must have been some negativity here,

00:07:05.844 --> 00:07:10.816
because the ashta vinayak and the three-and-a-half peethas emerged here,

00:07:11.017 --> 00:07:12.548
and apart from this,

00:07:12.749 --> 00:07:16.236
there is the manifestation of the three aspects of the Devi particularly in Bombay,

00:07:16.437 --> 00:07:20.788
indicates that there must have been some great negativity here,

00:07:20.989 --> 00:07:23.257
that is why such hard work had to be done here.

00:07:23.467 --> 00:07:26.191
And I was also born in Maharashtra.

00:07:27.017 --> 00:07:29.410
So, one must reflect on, what is the reason,

00:07:29.611 --> 00:07:34.201
what kind of shortcoming is here, in Maharashtra.

00:07:34.402 --> 00:07:36.921
It is very important for the people of Bombay to think about it.

00:07:37.122 --> 00:07:39.476
First, there is a lot of materialism here.

00:07:39.677 --> 00:07:41.149
The English came here,

00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.374
and taught English culture and English style,

00:07:44.575 --> 00:07:46.847
and people became materialistic.

00:07:47.048 --> 00:07:48.750
Whatever they taught the Mumbai people,

00:07:48.957 --> 00:07:51.073
caused their attention to wander outside.

00:07:51.274 --> 00:07:53.168
The English stayed here for a long time

00:07:53.352 --> 00:07:55.466
and they also liked Mumbai.

00:07:55.667 --> 00:07:58.458
Later, through the sea routes, the Portugese came,

00:07:58.659 --> 00:08:01.356
and many others came and left their influence here.

00:08:01.557 --> 00:08:06.390
As a result the materialism increased here.

00:08:06.613 --> 00:08:10.227
So from the beginning, the people here were very materialistic,

00:08:10.436 --> 00:08:12.791
and now they became even more materialistic.

00:08:12.992 --> 00:08:18.775
Now there is a lot of materialism in the people of Mumbai.

00:08:18.976 --> 00:08:21.427
And so, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:21.619 --> 00:08:24.097
sometimes materialism is still sticking on to them.

00:08:24.298 --> 00:08:26.280
And because of this materialism,

00:08:26.481 --> 00:08:30.423
their spiritual ascent is not as much as other people.

00:08:30.624 --> 00:08:32.205
This is very surprising!

00:08:32.406 --> 00:08:35.475
Even after all the hard work in Maharashtra,

00:08:35.676 --> 00:08:41.632
I feel, I could not do as much work here as I did in North India.

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:44.970
The number of people here did not grow as much as in North India.

00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:50.143
The only reason is that we still have a kind of inertia in us.

00:08:50.344 --> 00:08:52.575
Even for religion there is attachment.

00:08:52.776 --> 00:08:54.978
Even now here there are so many fake gurus,

00:08:55.179 --> 00:08:58.309
which I think are not there in North India,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:00.149
because they were not encouraged.

00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:02.425
And those people who are materialistic here,

00:09:02.639 --> 00:09:06.028
they like those fake gurus who are tantriks

00:09:06.229 --> 00:09:10.569
and who can help them to cause distress to others.

00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:12.919
Thirdly, there are a lot of false gurus,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.548
who have also caught hold of materialistic people

00:09:15.739 --> 00:09:17.426
and have taught them

00:09:17.627 --> 00:09:21.099
that it is alright, one just has to take the name of God,

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.831
and one can live anyhow or just meditate.

00:09:26.032 --> 00:09:28.254
But towards their disciples

00:09:28.455 --> 00:09:35.195
these gurus lacked a strong desire

00:09:35.396 --> 00:09:40.638
that something good should happen to them and they should benefit,

00:09:40.839 --> 00:09:45.639
this kind of desire is not these gurus' heart.

00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.640
Some of them might not be false gurus,

00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:50.629
but even so they don't think what they've given to their followers?

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:53.849
"They have served me so much, taken have taken so much care of me,

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:55.505
but what have I given them?"

00:09:55.706 --> 00:09:58.318
Hence with the prevailing system here,

00:09:58.519 --> 00:10:00.902
these people somehow fit in.

00:10:01.103 --> 00:10:04.561
Then the fourth type which I see here is,

00:10:04.762 --> 00:10:06.691
is particularly among brahmins.

00:10:06.892 --> 00:10:12.440
It is very surprising that they once used to fight

00:10:12.641 --> 00:10:14.176
that there should be no caste system;

00:10:14.409 --> 00:10:17.031
many brahmins have worked hard,

00:10:17.232 --> 00:10:20.286
that women should marry and widows should re-marry;

00:10:20.487 --> 00:10:22.565
A lot of work has been done by Agarkar sahib

00:10:22.766 --> 00:10:28.313
and many popular writers of Marathi,

00:10:28.514 --> 00:10:32.156
or many poets, or even saints, who were Brahmins,

00:10:32.357 --> 00:10:34.209
have worked really very hard for this.

00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:39.086
We can say Ramdas swamy, Rishen??? Saraswati and many others,

00:10:39.287 --> 00:10:41.168
who were brahmins,

00:10:41.375 --> 00:10:45.986
worked very hard and established spirituality.

00:10:46.187 --> 00:10:50.883
For example we can say Tasghanu???? has said:

00:10:51.084 --> 00:10:56.658
Amazhi man ki brahman; Amhi Jaaneli nahin Brahma. Amhitasli Brahman. (They call us brahmin, but we do not know Brahma, then what kind of brahmins are we?)

00:10:56.859 --> 00:11:00.844
They awakened within us the awareness

00:11:01.059 --> 00:11:03.909
that until one doesn't know Brahma, he is not a brahmin.

00:11:04.110 --> 00:11:06.113
And they have tried every possible way

00:11:06.304 --> 00:11:10.526
to remove brahminism and caste consciousness,

00:11:10.727 --> 00:11:12.162
and remove all such things.

00:11:12.363 --> 00:11:14.494
But now in the modern times I see

00:11:14.695 --> 00:11:17.275
that it is the brahmins who have become most modern.

00:11:17.476 --> 00:11:19.828
If you see a lady with a short haircut,

00:11:20.029 --> 00:11:23.140
wearing dark glasses and smoking a cigarette,

00:11:23.341 --> 00:11:25.808
suprisingly you find out that she is a brahmin.

00:11:26.009 --> 00:11:28.912
How this change has happened is beyond My understanding.

00:11:29.113 --> 00:11:33.151
but mostly it observed that these changes have come in them.

00:11:33.352 --> 00:11:36.335
Secondly, the other community which is called maratha,

00:11:36.536 --> 00:11:39.852
who no more carry swords, are now cutting each others throats (with words).

00:11:40.053 --> 00:11:41.723
Now what else to do with the swords?

00:11:41.924 --> 00:11:44.918
They think they once used to fight with swords for Shivaji Maharaj,

00:11:45.119 --> 00:11:49.266
and now we can use them to cut off each other’s throats.

00:11:49.467 --> 00:11:50.881
This is how it happened.

00:11:51.082 --> 00:11:54.447
And third thing is that there is no Vaishya community in Maharashtra,

00:11:54.648 --> 00:11:56.540
because they don't know how to do business.

00:11:56.741 --> 00:12:00.297
Being very outspoken, they cannot manage business at all.

00:12:00.498 --> 00:12:04.736
So among whom should I establish spirituality, I don't understand.

00:12:04.937 --> 00:12:07.638
To whom can I ask to establish spirituality?

00:12:07.839 --> 00:12:10.492
Trying to eradicate caste and creed,

00:12:10.693 --> 00:12:14.227
to eradicate wrong ideals,

00:12:14.428 --> 00:12:17.474
is impossible; on the contrary they are going deeper into the mire.

00:12:17.675 --> 00:12:21.610
And nowadays, it has increased so much

00:12:21.811 --> 00:12:25.383
that none is able to understand that caste system is useless

00:12:25.584 --> 00:12:27.938
and this is only going to lead to destruction.

00:12:28.139 --> 00:12:29.586
And it is a myth.

00:12:29.787 --> 00:12:32.589
In this way, we should put our attention

00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:36.047
on these kinds of numerous trends that have started in Maharashtra.

00:12:36.248 --> 00:12:41.815
Although, the people here are simple and also innocent

00:12:42.016 --> 00:12:48.533
and their craving for wealth is very less,

00:12:48.734 --> 00:12:50.081
not a massive one.

00:12:50.282 --> 00:12:53.122
But, they have great faith in Shri Ganesha,

00:12:53.323 --> 00:12:54.675
which is a big thing.

00:12:54.876 --> 00:13:01.926
Because of this their moral values

00:13:02.127 --> 00:13:03.660
are still intact.

00:13:03.861 --> 00:13:06.877
This is a great asset for them,

00:13:07.068 --> 00:13:08.962
that they have a strong moral sense.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:11.883
And only through those who have moral sense, the work can be done.

00:13:12.084 --> 00:13:15.761
In my opinion where there is no moral sense,

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:17.894
the work happens rather slowly.

00:13:18.095 --> 00:13:22.373
But now My experience is that

00:13:22.574 --> 00:13:25.241
whether there is moral sense or not,

00:13:25.442 --> 00:13:27.580
unless people have depth,

00:13:27.781 --> 00:13:30.261
they cannot progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:30.462 --> 00:13:32.516
So, here lots of people get Realisation.

00:13:32.717 --> 00:13:34.391
I go to many towns and villages,

00:13:34.592 --> 00:13:37.165
thousands get Realisation but they don't settle down.

00:13:37.366 --> 00:13:41.059
The main reason for this is that they haven't touched their depth.

00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:44.290
So today, whatever Puja we are doing,

00:13:44.465 --> 00:13:46.250
we must keep in mind

00:13:46.451 --> 00:13:51.030
that we should take Maharashtra's defects into consideration,

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:53.783
while doing Sahaja Yoga work here.

00:13:53.984 --> 00:13:56.978
In this situation we should understand that every place has defects,

00:13:57.179 --> 00:13:59.704
no person is complete and perfect.

00:13:59.905 --> 00:14:01.636
Everyone has some shortcomings

00:14:01.837 --> 00:14:04.435
and in some cases the weaknesses could be also

00:14:04.634 --> 00:14:07.169
because they were ruled by outsiders - whatever.

00:14:07.370 --> 00:14:11.376
If you all work, by keeping in mind all the defects,

00:14:11.577 --> 00:14:14.396
then Sahaja Yoga can spread far and wide in these places,

00:14:14.597 --> 00:14:19.107
because whatever it is, saints have done a lot of work here.

00:14:19.308 --> 00:14:21.158
Based on their foundation,

00:14:21.359 --> 00:14:24.875
today our work can get established.

00:14:25.328 --> 00:14:28.563
So, we are sitting under the blessings of Mumbai

00:14:28.764 --> 00:14:31.550
and along with this blessing,

00:14:31.751 --> 00:14:38.191
you are being showered by the blessings of the three Shaktis.

00:14:38.392 --> 00:14:40.202
And with the support of this blessing,

00:14:40.403 --> 00:14:43.039
Sahaja Yoga should spread very fast here.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:46.643
But it has been seen that those who are already in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:46.844 --> 00:14:50.201
are not giving their full support to Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:50.402 --> 00:14:52.883
In a way they escape their responsibility.

00:14:53.084 --> 00:14:55.159
If you try to escape from your responsibilities,

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.532
then God will also escape from His responsibilities.

00:14:58.733 --> 00:15:01.443
The more effort you put in Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:01.644 --> 00:15:03.808
the more you are blessed.

00:15:04.009 --> 00:15:07.875
Because, I have already told you that now Kruta Yuga has started.

00:15:08.076 --> 00:15:11.561
Before this we could say that it was Kaliyuga.

00:15:11.762 --> 00:15:16.883
In Kaliyuga whatever mistakes you committed, were tolerated.

00:15:17.084 --> 00:15:18.801
But now Kruta Yuga has begun.

00:15:19.002 --> 00:15:23.176
In Kruta Yuga whatever wrong things you do,

00:15:23.377 --> 00:15:25.647
the repercussions are immediate.

00:15:25.848 --> 00:15:28.821
And whatever good deeds you do,

00:15:29.028 --> 00:15:32.089
will be rewarded instantaneously.

00:15:32.536 --> 00:15:36.228
So, nowadays such circumstances are prevalent,

00:15:36.429 --> 00:15:40.418
I would say, are in the environment.

00:15:40.619 --> 00:15:44.668
Therefore a person who is doing wrong things should be on the watch.

00:15:44.869 --> 00:15:46.960
Because the repercussion is immediate.

00:15:47.161 --> 00:15:50.331
Those who do good deeds,

00:15:50.532 --> 00:15:52.191
will be rewarded immediately.

00:15:52.392 --> 00:15:53.918
That is the state now.

00:15:54.119 --> 00:15:57.866
So, we should reflect, that if we are living in Mumbai,

00:15:58.067 --> 00:15:59.643
we can do lot of work here.

00:15:59.844 --> 00:16:02.108
That is why I have worked so hard in Mumbai.

00:16:02.309 --> 00:16:05.724
As a result so many of you are here.

00:16:05.925 --> 00:16:08.795
But, now you all should introspect,

00:16:08.996 --> 00:16:11.461
and see what you can do for Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:11.662 --> 00:16:13.861
Every night you sit and think:

00:16:14.062 --> 00:16:16.791
"What did we do for Sahaja Yoga? We do everything for us.

00:16:16.992 --> 00:16:18.587
What do we do for Sahaja Yoga?".

00:16:18.788 --> 00:16:20.527
Those who avoid working,

00:16:20.728 --> 00:16:23.286
will come and say: "Mother, we have got this disease

00:16:23.487 --> 00:16:26.335
and we have this trouble". it is bound to happen!

00:16:26.536 --> 00:16:28.454
Because if you avoid working for God,

00:16:28.655 --> 00:16:30.790
His attention will not be on you.

00:16:30.991 --> 00:16:34.405
Therefore if you want Paramchaitanya’s attention on you,

00:16:34.606 --> 00:16:37.728
you should always ask yourself what good deed have I done today?

00:16:37.929 --> 00:16:39.877
What did I do for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:16:40.078 --> 00:16:43.418
With all our heart what did we talk about Sahaja Yoga today?

00:16:43.619 --> 00:16:47.886
It is only by this that you will get all blessings,

00:16:48.087 --> 00:16:49.959
and you will know

00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:54.270
that you are absolutely blessed people in Sahaja Yoga

00:16:54.471 --> 00:16:56.930
and that you are sitting in the kingdom of God.

00:16:57.131 --> 00:16:58.913
And just as in any other kingdom,

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.249
if you do anything wrong,

00:17:01.450 --> 00:17:08.796
you get corrected and some punishment is inflicted upon you,

00:17:08.997 --> 00:17:11.427
same happens in God’s kingdom too.

00:17:11.628 --> 00:17:15.774
But some extra time is given here to see if you correct yourself.

00:17:15.975 --> 00:17:20.801
But instantly you get indications that you are doing wrong deeds

00:17:21.002 --> 00:17:22.935
because your vibrations will stop.

00:17:23.136 --> 00:17:27.476
That's why every step has to be taken very carefully and gently,

00:17:27.677 --> 00:17:30.805
and you have to go to a very high level

00:17:31.006 --> 00:17:35.375
because you know that it is important not only for the whole country

00:17:35.576 --> 00:17:40.216
but for the whole world it is necessary

00:17:40.417 --> 00:17:45.281
that Sahaja Yoga grows well in our Maharashtra.

00:17:45.482 --> 00:17:48.523
And from here the wealth of Sahaja Yoga should spread worldwide.

00:17:48.724 --> 00:17:53.158
And that is why I urge you again an again to make a pledge -

00:17:53.359 --> 00:17:55.342
because the New Year has started -

00:17:55.553 --> 00:18:00.300
that: "We will surrender ourselves to Sahaja Yoga completely,

00:18:00.501 --> 00:18:05.265
we will concentrate our minds towards our ascent,

00:18:05.466 --> 00:18:06.892
and we will handle it.

00:18:07.093 --> 00:18:10.827
This is for everyone, not only for Maharashtrians,

00:18:11.028 --> 00:18:13.798
but I am speaking to all the people of the world.

00:18:13.999 --> 00:18:16.632
I am sorry I had to talk in Hindi because most of them are,

00:18:16.712 --> 00:18:17.941
Hindi-knowing people,

00:18:18.037 --> 00:18:20.794
and I’ve just told them what is the importance of Bombay,

00:18:20.977 --> 00:18:26.096
and why so many incarnations came here,

00:18:26.261 --> 00:18:30.292
and why Shri Rama had to walk in the villages

00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:34.453
and the hills and dales of Maharashtra,

00:18:34.668 --> 00:18:35.794
what was the need,

00:18:36.049 --> 00:18:41.575
and the need is that they should all develop their Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:43.044 --> 00:18:47.482
Also, this would be the last Puja for all of you, in India.

00:18:48.364 --> 00:18:50.546
I hope you all have gained a lot,

00:18:50.826 --> 00:18:55.302
in these different Pujas and different places we have been to.

00:18:57.715 --> 00:19:02.241
Only thing is that one should remember that Kruta Yuga has started.

00:19:02.604 --> 00:19:05.135
Now, Kali Yuga is over, Kruta Yuga has started,

00:19:05.279 --> 00:19:09.842
and in this Yuga – that the Paramchaitanya

00:19:09.981 --> 00:19:13.640
is absolutely effective and very efficient.

00:19:14.057 --> 00:19:18.965
Now, if you do anything wrong it will punish you.

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:22.983
It may not punish immediately but it will give you a suggestion,

00:19:23.246 --> 00:19:25.872
it will give you a proper signal,

00:19:25.976 --> 00:19:27.904
that something is going wrong with you.

00:19:28.125 --> 00:19:31.128
But if you do not try to control your footsteps,

00:19:31.367 --> 00:19:33.255
then you may go down very fast.

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:35.858
So you have to be very careful about that.

00:19:36.129 --> 00:19:37.662
Actually, I have told you so many times,

00:19:37.758 --> 00:19:39.400
that there are two forces working,

00:19:39.536 --> 00:19:42.307
one which attracts you inside and one which throws you out.

00:19:42.443 --> 00:19:45.601
So, it is important for all of us,

00:19:47.966 --> 00:19:51.082
all of us to remember that this Kruta Yuga is there,

00:19:51.333 --> 00:19:54.166
and in that this Paramchaitanya is overactive.

00:19:54.468 --> 00:19:56.031
Also, you are rewarded.

00:19:56.246 --> 00:19:58.915
You have been telling me so many stories,

00:19:59.146 --> 00:20:01.780
how sahaj it worked out, how sahaj it has happened,

00:20:01.915 --> 00:20:04.820
all of you have been telling Me very nice story.

00:20:05.328 --> 00:20:09.407
But it is part of your

00:20:11.557 --> 00:20:13.398
your play in Sahaja Yoga

00:20:13.621 --> 00:20:16.287
and that you are placed in the kingdom of God.

00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:20.702
So, in the kingdom of God you are there, try to enjoy it,

00:20:20.846 --> 00:20:24.059
that’s the only thing you have to do is to enjoy the kingdom of God.

00:20:24.163 --> 00:20:29.681
But if you try to, sort of, dislocate yourself from this joy,

00:20:29.842 --> 00:20:34.347
break the connection of joy by some sort of thinking,

00:20:34.522 --> 00:20:37.108
which is not reality,

00:20:37.309 --> 00:20:39.910
then you are responsible for yourself.

00:20:39.795 --> 00:20:42.794
So, I have to tell you that keep the connection on,

00:20:42.922 --> 00:20:46.654
Not only that, but try to make it stronger and stronger,

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:50.556
and become one with that divine force

00:20:51.021 --> 00:20:53.191
permanently, which will flow through you

00:20:53.303 --> 00:20:57.463
and will not only enlighten you but will give you so many powers,

00:20:57.582 --> 00:21:01.335
and you will see the new life in this new year.

00:21:01.876 --> 00:21:05.020
Yesterday, as I requested you, we have to work it out now.

00:21:05.124 --> 00:21:08.337
Individually, we have to go all out to see,

00:21:08.457 --> 00:21:11.266
that we spread Sahaja Yoga and talk about it.

00:21:11.378 --> 00:21:14.602
I, on this day I give you complete freedom.

00:21:14.750 --> 00:21:16.878
to do what you like to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:17.069 --> 00:21:19.108
You need not ask Me any permissions,

00:21:19.244 --> 00:21:21.522
and you can try everything that you want to.

00:21:21.610 --> 00:21:25.356
But should be something decent, should not be something indecent

00:21:25.594 --> 00:21:30.303
and something which is not behoving a sahaja yogi.

00:21:30.414 --> 00:21:33.437
Even if you have to write letters or answers or anything,

00:21:33.993 --> 00:21:35.882
even if you have to show the anger,

00:21:36.083 --> 00:21:40.735
it should be done in a very decent and a beautiful manner.

00:21:40.936 --> 00:21:45.915
And it should show that it’s a yogi who is talking.

00:21:46.116 --> 00:21:50.000
The other things, whatever problems you have,

00:21:50.132 --> 00:21:52.745
will be solved in no time.

00:21:53.015 --> 00:21:55.205
But the main problem is yourself,

00:21:55.406 --> 00:21:58.602
which should be solved by you by meditative methods.

00:21:58.444 --> 00:22:05.465
And so much attention we are paying to all our extra-curricular activities

00:22:05.666 --> 00:22:09.886
but that will definitely fail, it will boomerang on you

00:22:09.449 --> 00:22:12.218
if you do not have the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:12.361 --> 00:22:16.805
It is very important to keep attention on your spirit all the time,

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:20.848
so that whatever you are doing, whatever you are projecting,

00:22:20.998 --> 00:22:23.419
has the base and you just don’t get lost.

00:22:23.665 --> 00:22:25.284
This is a very important thing,

00:22:25.451 --> 00:22:28.333
and I am sure that you will understand

00:22:28.533 --> 00:22:35.917
that without the nourishment from the roots you cannot grow.

00:22:36.118 --> 00:22:39.497
So this nourishment must be kept alive.

00:22:39.397 --> 00:22:42.134
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
