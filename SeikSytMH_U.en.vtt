00:08:18.784 --> 00:08:23.367
1987-0516 Shri Ganesha Puja, Auckland (New Zealand)

00:13:07.898 --> 00:13:15.422
I think it was, very nice that I could come to New Zealand.

00:13:17.993 --> 00:13:21.867
You should not feel depressed or unhappy,

00:13:21.988 --> 00:13:25.978
that the program started with a big bang and then it subsided

00:13:26.098 --> 00:13:30.353
then its coming up and all that. This is a common thing.

00:13:30.474 --> 00:13:34.662
Because it is a living process. In every living process,

00:13:34.783 --> 00:13:38.027
the thing starts with a very small thing.

00:13:38.147 --> 00:13:46.141
And then it grows, according to the weight, that one can, bear.

00:13:46.506 --> 00:13:51.973
You see the little tree, or when it was just a sampling,

00:13:52.093 --> 00:13:55.358
it had to fight a lot to come up.

00:13:55.478 --> 00:14:01.401
And when it came up, then also, it would not bear fruits.

00:14:01.521 --> 00:14:05.098
It would only bear two leaves, you see, to open out.

00:14:05.218 --> 00:14:10.475
Because the stock was not so powerful to hold the whole thing.

00:14:10.595 --> 00:14:14.370
So when your Sahaja Yogis will be more, and ready,

00:14:14.490 --> 00:14:17.237
then you’ll get more people and more people.

00:14:17.357 --> 00:14:20.987
But one should not expect too much of quantity.

00:14:21.107 --> 00:14:23.538
What we need is quality.

00:14:23.658 --> 00:14:28.598
If you try for quantity, then there would be a problem.

00:14:29.463 --> 00:14:33.225
Because quantity, the quality will go down.

00:14:33.345 --> 00:14:35.735
So in the beginning, when it is the foundation,

00:14:35.855 --> 00:14:39.163
it is very important to have good quality.

00:14:39.283 --> 00:14:41.270
As you see in a house,

00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:45.705
in the foundation we always put, very heavy stones,

00:14:45.825 --> 00:14:48.244
which can bear the whole structure.

00:14:48.364 --> 00:14:51.577
In the same way, in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

00:14:51.697 --> 00:14:57.103
we have to put very solid people, to work it out.

00:14:57.223 --> 00:15:01.871
Unless and until they are of a very solid nature, they’re thrown out.

00:15:01.991 --> 00:15:04.889
That’s why Christ has said, first could be the last.

00:15:05.009 --> 00:15:07.862
Because so many people come for the first time,

00:15:07.982 --> 00:15:10.810
and may just get lost. Because they are no good.

00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:13.279
They have to bear the structure.

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:15.904
They cannot be ordinary Sahaja Yogis.

00:15:16.024 --> 00:15:22.692
Now we have many qualities, to, to make it really,

00:15:22.812 --> 00:15:30.662
very very strong and also, to make it bearing.

00:15:30.782 --> 00:15:35.216
First of all, a Sahaja Yogi, which is on in the foundation

00:15:35.336 --> 00:15:40.419
doesn’t show off. He bears, he holds.

00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:46.307
He is the, actually the Adhara as they say, the support.

00:15:46.427 --> 00:15:49.629
The complete support of Sahaja Yoga in a country.

00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:52.387
So the first few, you come to the Sahaja Yoga,

00:15:52.507 --> 00:15:55.006
are very very important people.

00:15:55.126 --> 00:15:57.957
And an intensive work has to be done on them.

00:15:58.077 --> 00:16:01.370
And they have to work out also intensively.

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:02.937
Because the first ones,

00:16:03.057 --> 00:16:07.053
if they are weak, the whole thing topples down.

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:11.217
So by some mistake, you see, some weak persons may join you.

00:16:11.337 --> 00:16:13.311
Then the whole thing will topple down.

00:16:13.432 --> 00:16:16.709
Again you’ll have to raise it. It’s like another resurrection.

00:16:16.829 --> 00:16:20.172
Then again you have to see that you don’t have weak people there.

00:16:20.292 --> 00:16:22.664
Then you have to build them up in such a manner

00:16:22.784 --> 00:16:25.894
that they grow properly

00:16:26.014 --> 00:16:30.504
to the size that can bear the whole structure.

00:16:30.624 --> 00:16:32.542
Later on, of course, you’ll be surprised,

00:16:32.662 --> 00:16:36.604
the structure grows very fast. Like in Australia

00:16:36.724 --> 00:16:41.864
you know we started in a very, very, poor way, to begin with.

00:16:41.984 --> 00:16:45.466
And the people who really started are out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:45.586 --> 00:16:48.957
Absolutely out. And the rest of them,

00:16:49.077 --> 00:16:52.992
out of them also, those who were really solid people,

00:16:53.112 --> 00:16:58.241
could form the foundation of Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:02.814
So, one has to be careful, as to understand,

00:17:02.934 --> 00:17:07.078
that what we need now is quality, not the quantity.

00:17:07.198 --> 00:17:09.960
If you have too many people around your heads,

00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:12.304
you won’t be able to manage them at all.

00:17:12.424 --> 00:17:15.608
But if you have few good people you should be thankful.

00:17:15.728 --> 00:17:19.968
That’s why, if, there is no publicity that has come,

00:17:20.088 --> 00:17:24.738
or there are small number of people, you should be very satisfied.

00:17:24.858 --> 00:17:26.654
Not to feel sad about it,

00:17:26.774 --> 00:17:29.315
that see now, Sahaja Yoga is not spreading.

00:17:29.435 --> 00:17:32.316
It’s not the spreading that is important now.

00:17:32.436 --> 00:17:38.677
Is the deeper, embeddiment, that is important.

00:17:38.797 --> 00:17:42.559
And for that we need really solid people for Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:42.679 --> 00:17:46.212
So, you are the first, few people here,

00:17:46.332 --> 00:17:48.895
who are going to form the foundation,

00:17:49.015 --> 00:17:51.703
of New Zealand’s Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:51.823 --> 00:17:55.629
Maybe one day it might be a very very big structure.

00:17:55.749 --> 00:17:59.400
Doesn’t matter. Maybe your, you might be, taking a role

00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.896
of a foundation, which doesn’t show off.

00:18:03.476 --> 00:18:07.387
But your names will be written in golden letters,

00:18:07.736 --> 00:18:10.620
that such people started Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:10.740 --> 00:18:13.227
Because it’s a big struggle in the beginning to

00:18:13.347 --> 00:18:15.339
implement Sahaja Yoga.

00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:21.400
Now I have seen that people, who are false spread very fast.

00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:24.324
Very fast. You’ll hear their names everywhere,

00:18:24.444 --> 00:18:26.484
suddenly you see it’s all going everywhere.

00:18:26.604 --> 00:18:29.727
And you’ll be surprised that they are in the market already.

00:18:29.847 --> 00:18:33.501
The reason is, that, is not a living process.

00:18:34.295 --> 00:18:35.923
Is just Plastics.

00:18:36.043 --> 00:18:41.015
Plastic flower you can produce, in 1 day, thousands.

00:18:41.135 --> 00:18:44.805
But to produce 1 flower, on a tree,

00:18:45.305 --> 00:18:48.048
first flower is so difficult.

00:18:48.168 --> 00:18:51.862
Then few flowers, then the blossom time comes.

00:18:51.982 --> 00:18:55.460
Is not, that suddenly you get many flowers.

00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.249
So one has to understand that, in the beginning of anything,

00:18:59.369 --> 00:19:02.732
there are difficulties, and there are problems.

00:19:02.852 --> 00:19:04.382
Funny people will come in,

00:19:04.502 --> 00:19:06.732
they start doubting, they’ll go out.

00:19:06.852 --> 00:19:09.556
Then some more will come, they will get into it,

00:19:09.676 --> 00:19:11.930
they will do this, and they’ll get out.

00:19:12.050 --> 00:19:15.204
So there are two forces always working in Sahaja Yoga:

00:19:15.324 --> 00:19:18.486
one is the centripetal, another is centrifugal.

00:19:18.606 --> 00:19:21.784
By one force, people are attracted towards to Sahaja Yoga,

00:19:21.904 --> 00:19:23.538
because they know it’s the truth.

00:19:23.658 --> 00:19:26.157
And this is the end of their seeking.

00:19:26.277 --> 00:19:29.554
And this, they have to have. Because they, find out

00:19:29.674 --> 00:19:33.652
through their pure intelligence that this is the way.

00:19:33.772 --> 00:19:36.179
Now there are people who just try to test,

00:19:36.299 --> 00:19:38.596
like guru shopping you see. So they think:

00:19:38.716 --> 00:19:42.109
“let us go this shop is, they don’t charge you anything.

00:19:42.229 --> 00:19:43.232
Let’s get in here”.

00:19:43.352 --> 00:19:46.911
but they are the people, who just do not stick-on sometime.

00:19:47.031 --> 00:19:50.232
Or they have too many problems, from other gurus maybe.

00:19:50.352 --> 00:19:52.347
Or maybe they may stick-on.

00:19:52.467 --> 00:19:56.025
And some of them who stick-on, stick-on very well.

00:19:56.145 --> 00:20:00.338
So, we cannot say, what immediately will happen,

00:20:00.458 --> 00:20:03.523
in a living process you can’t say this tree,

00:20:03.643 --> 00:20:04.828
which side it will take?

00:20:04.948 --> 00:20:07.386
Whether it will go straight or on the sides

00:20:07.506 --> 00:20:09.128
or it will move the other way.

00:20:09.248 --> 00:20:11.406
So, it is, you cannot say that way.

00:20:11.526 --> 00:20:17.165
But we can say one thing, that, at least from my experience,

00:20:17.285 --> 00:20:20.870
I feel that in the beginning, whatever starts in a small way,

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.642
in a struggling way, really is embedding itself nicely,

00:20:24.762 --> 00:20:26.555
into the Mother Earth.

00:20:26.675 --> 00:20:28.241
And is a very good sign.

00:20:28.361 --> 00:20:31.817
Because that’s the way, it always works out better.

00:20:31.937 --> 00:20:34.836
Whatever is frivolous, or whatever is cheapish,

00:20:34.956 --> 00:20:39.958
or which spreads out without much difficulties, is of no use.

00:20:40.078 --> 00:20:44.163
It’s like grass. Anybody can take it away.

00:20:44.283 --> 00:20:47.277
So the embeddiment and all that, has to go inside.

00:20:47.397 --> 00:20:50.027
As you are shaking it nicely to go inside.

00:20:50.147 --> 00:20:53.467
And that’s what it is. Where, you should be very happy,

00:20:53.587 --> 00:20:55.182
that it is working out that way.

00:20:55.302 --> 00:21:01.434
Somebody has come? Let him come. Come along.

00:21:08.839 --> 00:21:15.751
So the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, may look to be little shaky.

00:21:15.871 --> 00:21:19.252
May look to be little feeble. But it is not.

00:21:19.372 --> 00:21:22.504
It is getting stronger and stronger.

00:21:22.624 --> 00:21:26.555
And it is getting embedded into the Mother Earth.

00:21:26.675 --> 00:21:31.681
And, that is what, is the test of you being the real seekers.

00:21:31.801 --> 00:21:35.375
You being the people who want truth.

00:21:35.495 --> 00:21:39.433
Who do not want a big show, big,

00:21:39.553 --> 00:21:43.136
sort of a, community sitting there,

00:21:43.256 --> 00:21:48.746
all going mad with some sort of a shouting, screaming and nonsense.

00:21:48.866 --> 00:21:52.656
As it is you know, Sahaja Yoga, is a living process.

00:21:52.776 --> 00:21:56.055
And, it goes both, grows both, both ways.

00:21:56.175 --> 00:21:58.606
Upwards and downwards.

00:21:58.726 --> 00:22:01.276
In the beginning it grows more downwards,

00:22:01.396 --> 00:22:04.428
and in the downwards process, we have to depend,

00:22:04.562 --> 00:22:08.680
on our vibrations very much. We must all the time remember,

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:13.351
that we are realized souls. That we have got vibrations.

00:22:13.471 --> 00:22:15.499
This is the way we have to judge.

00:22:15.619 --> 00:22:17.769
This is the way we have to understand.

00:22:17.889 --> 00:22:22.266
The vibration is the only way, that we’ll know others.

00:22:22.386 --> 00:22:26.333
Not by something, something you will feel

00:22:26.453 --> 00:22:29.397
that the person looks very sweet and nice and,

00:22:29.517 --> 00:22:31.743
may a snake come out of that person.

00:22:31.863 --> 00:22:35.646
So best is, to judge a person, through vibrations.

00:22:35.766 --> 00:22:37.928
Judge everything through vibrations.

00:22:38.048 --> 00:22:40.595
Not through your own understanding,

00:22:40.715 --> 00:22:44.559
or superficial methods of judging others.

00:22:44.679 --> 00:22:47.761
Now, there are also so many conditionings we have got,

00:22:47.881 --> 00:22:52.438
by which we judge others. And these conditionings, can also,

00:22:52.558 --> 00:22:57.322
bias our judgment. So best way is to see the vibrations.

00:22:57.442 --> 00:23:00.403
Through vibrations, you will have the real knowledge

00:23:00.523 --> 00:23:02.363
about what is happening.

00:23:02.483 --> 00:23:06.839
Now many people, in the beginning, also start misguiding.

00:23:06.959 --> 00:23:09.913
So best is to develop your vibrations.

00:23:10.033 --> 00:23:12.525
For that you have to grow inward first of all.

00:23:12.645 --> 00:23:17.320
If you grow inward, deeply, then what will happen,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:22.853
that outward growth will be very solid, and would be exact.

00:23:22.973 --> 00:23:25.034
You won’t have any problems with that.

00:23:25.154 --> 00:23:26.907
But if you do not grow inward,

00:23:27.027 --> 00:23:29.973
if you do not meditate and pay attention to it,

00:23:30.093 --> 00:23:35.398
and, I would say, it is more the dedication that you have,

00:23:35.518 --> 00:23:40.309
that works out so well that you grow upwards so well.

00:23:40.429 --> 00:23:43.889
I mean you can give a speech whenever you want about Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:44.009 --> 00:23:46.675
you can give realization to people whenever you want,

00:23:46.795 --> 00:23:49.011
you can cure people whenever you want.

00:23:49.131 --> 00:23:51.536
But first, there should be a depth in you.

00:23:51.656 --> 00:23:53.340
If that you have not achieved,

00:23:53.460 --> 00:23:55.895
you just start superficially doing something.

00:23:56.015 --> 00:23:59.531
Then maybe you are hit, or maybe you are in trouble,

00:23:59.651 --> 00:24:04.762
or maybe you may start doubting yourself, maybe Sahaja Yoga too.

00:24:04.882 --> 00:24:08.969
So the first thing is for us to grow deeply.

00:24:09.089 --> 00:24:12.916
And while we are growing deeply, we have to also grow

00:24:13.036 --> 00:24:18.152
in such a manner that we understand our vibrations clearly.

00:24:18.272 --> 00:24:22.638
Now see a root, of a little plant,

00:24:22.758 --> 00:24:27.399
has a got a very small little cell at the base of it.

00:24:27.519 --> 00:24:30.552
And the plant, doesn’t know anything,

00:24:30.672 --> 00:24:33.147
as much as that little cell knows.

00:24:33.267 --> 00:24:38.637
Because it is going inside, by its own intelligence,

00:24:38.757 --> 00:24:40.280
its own vibrations.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:43.081
Now if it finds a stone, it doesn’t go and quarrel.

00:24:43.201 --> 00:24:46.305
So don’t fight with the people who are stonies.

00:24:46.425 --> 00:24:47.917
Just don’t argue with them.

00:24:48.037 --> 00:24:50.870
You cannot make them understand. It’s not possible.

00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:54.130
They have to be seekers and soft,

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:57.046
like the soft clay you can say,

00:24:57.166 --> 00:25:03.528
through which this little cell goes, penetrates.

00:25:03.648 --> 00:25:07.382
Then it finds, supposing, it finds a big stone.

00:25:07.778 --> 00:25:09.990
Then what, it goes round and round and round.

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:13.410
So gives it a bandhan nicely! And goes down.

00:25:13.530 --> 00:25:16.881
Later on when it becomes a tree, he uses the stone

00:25:17.001 --> 00:25:20.942
for its, you see, for its support.

00:25:21.062 --> 00:25:22.109
So in the same way,

00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:25.251
you can go round and round and round somebody like that.

00:25:25.371 --> 00:25:28.163
But, giving just bandhan without saying anything.

00:25:28.283 --> 00:25:31.437
In your heart. Not saying, arguing with him anything.

00:25:31.557 --> 00:25:34.460
Because you’ll break your head but he will never be alright.

00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.752
So best is not to argue with him.

00:25:36.872 --> 00:25:38.859
But just give him bandhan in your heart

00:25:38.979 --> 00:25:41.978
and somehow or another bind it. So that later on,

00:25:42.098 --> 00:25:44.453
you see, he will become Sahaja Yogi,

00:25:44.573 --> 00:25:46.128
but will be a big support to us.

00:25:46.248 --> 00:25:48.836
Because it’s just a stone you see. Just now,

00:25:48.956 --> 00:25:52.832
use soft people, people who are easy people,

00:25:52.952 --> 00:25:58.061
people who are seekers, who are not so complicated.

00:25:58.942 --> 00:26:00.981
And, you cannot argue it out.

00:26:01.101 --> 00:26:04.068
Sahaja Yoga cannot be argued out, cannot be explained to.

00:26:04.188 --> 00:26:07.132
Only thing you have to get it. And if they don’t get it,

00:26:07.252 --> 00:26:09.949
you cannot argue it out: “Oh this is this, this is this”.

00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:12.441
Like, one reporter was asking me:

00:26:12.561 --> 00:26:14.862
“why is it I’m not getting realization?”.

00:26:14.982 --> 00:26:17.441
I couldn’t tell him that he was such an egoist.

00:26:17.561 --> 00:26:20.659
I couldn’t tell him that so I said: “maybe this, maybe that”.

00:26:20.779 --> 00:26:22.702
you see, I was avoiding the topic!

00:26:22.822 --> 00:26:24.603
No use telling him you are a big egoist.

00:26:24.723 --> 00:26:27.794
How can you get your realization? Because if I tell him like that,

00:26:27.914 --> 00:26:31.651
then he would be, just off! Absolutely. And he would be against

00:26:31.771 --> 00:26:33.314
Sahaja Yoga completely.

00:26:33.434 --> 00:26:37.564
So we have to use also, tactfully, a method by which

00:26:37.684 --> 00:26:41.624
we do not hurt others. But try to be nice and gentle,

00:26:41.744 --> 00:26:43.984
so they like at least your outer appearance

00:26:44.104 --> 00:26:48.886
that they are very gentle people, they
are very good people and all that.

00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:52.829
Now, in Sahaja Yoga also there is a temptation you might have.

00:26:52.949 --> 00:26:55.402
Because you suddenly get lot of money sometimes,

00:26:55.522 --> 00:26:57.373
suddenly get a big position.

00:26:57.493 --> 00:27:06.419
Suddenly, also you might get a very, rare, dynamic gifts.

00:27:06.539 --> 00:27:10.354
Like you can become great artist, you can become a great poet,

00:27:10.474 --> 00:27:13.736
you might be, something might happen to you suddenly.

00:27:13.856 --> 00:27:18.179
You get a public speaking gifts or anything like that.

00:27:18.299 --> 00:27:21.857
But these are all temptations, and one should not fall into it.

00:27:21.977 --> 00:27:24.972
Of course you must use them for Sahaja Yoga, is alright.

00:27:25.092 --> 00:27:26.713
But you should not fall into it

00:27:26.833 --> 00:27:29.344
and start thinking I’m something great. You see.

00:27:29.464 --> 00:27:34.245
If that is done, then there is a big problem because,

00:27:35.094 --> 00:27:40.344
such a thing gets a person completely out of Sahaja Yoga

00:27:40.464 --> 00:27:43.118
and he gets also punished, in a way.

00:27:43.238 --> 00:27:45.160
Maybe he loses his powers.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.578
So it’s best is, to keep to your Sahaja Yoga meditation.

00:27:50.698 --> 00:27:53.078
Keep to your own understanding.

00:27:53.198 --> 00:27:55.543
Know yourself, that is the best way.

00:27:55.663 --> 00:28:00.358
And not to be diverted by all these temptations.

00:28:00.478 --> 00:28:03.004
But the same can be used for Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:03.124 --> 00:28:06.404
If that is used for Sahaja Yoga, there is nothing wrong.

00:28:06.524 --> 00:28:10.687
Because these gifts are given to you, not to tempt you but,

00:28:10.807 --> 00:28:13.315
for using for Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:13.435 --> 00:28:18.092
For example, she got my photograph with the light on my head.

00:28:18.212 --> 00:28:25.975
That means there is something happen, between her and the light.

00:28:26.095 --> 00:28:29.437
Because how did I get that light upon my head is a problem.

00:28:29.557 --> 00:28:33.997
To be understood, very simply, that the Vishnumaya is the,

00:28:34.853 --> 00:28:38.929
is the, Goddess for light. For electricity.

00:28:39.468 --> 00:28:43.220
And if She wants, She can turn it into any angle

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:47.423
and can put a subtle meaning to her photograph.

00:28:47.543 --> 00:28:50.047
Now people have taken photographs of the clouds

00:28:50.167 --> 00:28:52.476
and they found me there, absolutely there.

00:28:52.596 --> 00:28:55.162
People believe it or not but it is so.

00:28:55.282 --> 00:28:57.490
Two photographs they saw like that.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:00.662
And normally we don’t take photographs of the clouds.

00:29:00.782 --> 00:29:02.785
But it showed in such a way that,

00:29:02.905 --> 00:29:09.250
they first saw a very, luminous, cluster of a cloud.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:13.240
And then it expanded and started looking like a Ganesha.

00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.360
So, their attention was attracted.

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:21.993
Then, strings of lights started flowing from both the sides.

00:29:22.113 --> 00:29:24.156
And they found two clusters.

00:29:24.276 --> 00:29:26.442
So they took photos of these two clusters

00:29:26.563 --> 00:29:29.273
and when they developed it, they found my photographs,

00:29:29.393 --> 00:29:31.368
two photographs of mine were there.

00:29:31.488 --> 00:29:34.949
One was with, even with the nose thing, when I was wearing it,

00:29:35.069 --> 00:29:36.335
means very latest ones!

00:29:36.455 --> 00:29:42.302
And another one where I look more like a, Red Indian face.

00:29:42.422 --> 00:29:45.107
That kind, coming out of the thing. It’s clearly,

00:29:45.227 --> 00:29:48.151
very clearly you can see. So that’s how they have taken it.

00:29:48.271 --> 00:29:52.297
It’s in the Bible, that you will know the Holy Ghost,

00:29:52.417 --> 00:29:58.099
with the forms of the clouds. Its written down.

00:29:58.219 --> 00:30:00.084
So this is how it is verified.

00:30:00.205 --> 00:30:02.810
But how many people are going to believe it? Very few.

00:30:02.930 --> 00:30:05.930
Very few people are going to believe that this is natural.

00:30:06.050 --> 00:30:09.053
They’ll think “oh, it’s all made up and done up and all that”.

00:30:09.173 --> 00:30:13.026
Because even if the nose ring is showing, is too much.

00:30:13.146 --> 00:30:15.058
Now this Vishnumaya works that way.

00:30:15.178 --> 00:30:18.300
There are so many other Deities who work out something

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:20.883
in a different way. But whatever it is,

00:30:21.003 --> 00:30:23.680
they are all for your construction.

00:30:23.800 --> 00:30:27.883
For your building up as a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:28.003 --> 00:30:31.857
So the inner movement is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:31.977 --> 00:30:35.361
I’m very happy to know that you people are gathering here,

00:30:35.481 --> 00:30:38.592
for meditation and you’re listening to my tapes

00:30:38.712 --> 00:30:42.011
and are growing up well, and I was very happy to see

00:30:42.131 --> 00:30:45.807
the way you are growing. And keep your steady growth.

00:30:45.927 --> 00:30:48.698
Then you’ll become great Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:48.818 --> 00:30:53.860
I’m sure one day, New Zealand or Australia,

00:30:53.980 --> 00:31:00.425
may become the leader, of all the world to, follow, spirituality.

00:31:00.545 --> 00:31:04.557
Because, India is, of course, I must say India is spiritually

00:31:04.677 --> 00:31:07.710
very developed but, they are not leaders I think.

00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.540
So far, I have not seen much leaders coming out of India.

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.399
But, once the leaders start coming out of India,

00:31:14.519 --> 00:31:16.927
we can say the, then the second position

00:31:17.047 --> 00:31:20.731
should be given to Australia and New Zealand.

00:31:20.851 --> 00:31:24.734
There will be great people coming out of Australia and New Zealand.

00:31:24.854 --> 00:31:31.823
No doubt about it. Because the, the root part maybe in India.

00:31:31.943 --> 00:31:34.723
The foundation part maybe from India,

00:31:34.843 --> 00:31:37.901
but the tree part, will be from the west.

00:31:38.021 --> 00:31:39.850
And that is how the east and west

00:31:39.970 --> 00:31:43.375
is going to complete the tree of Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:43.495 --> 00:31:46.204
blossoming and giving fruits.

00:31:46.324 --> 00:31:48.157
May God bless you all.
