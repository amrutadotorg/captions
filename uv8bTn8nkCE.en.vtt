00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.677
Hindi

00:05:33.885 --> 00:05:35.885
I am sorry I was delayed.

00:05:36.075 --> 00:05:38.955
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

00:05:39.195 --> 00:05:41.475
Tahsildar, as they call him.

00:05:41.715 --> 00:05:44.875
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

00:05:45.075 --> 00:05:48.995
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

00:05:49.195 --> 00:05:53.955
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

00:05:54.995 --> 00:05:58.155
I think

00:05:58.755 --> 00:06:01.875
it's not very much hot for you, see the

00:06:02.115 --> 00:06:05.915
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:15.035
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

00:06:24.715 --> 00:06:27.955
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

00:06:28.155 --> 00:06:32.675
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

00:06:32.875 --> 00:06:37.595
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

00:06:37.875 --> 00:06:40.395
and the visit to Jabalpur.

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:44.475
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

00:06:44.755 --> 00:06:49.555
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

00:06:49.835 --> 00:06:53.235
from Bombay.

00:06:53.475 --> 00:06:57.755
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

00:06:57.955 --> 00:07:01.835
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

00:07:02.075 --> 00:07:06.475
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

00:07:06.714 --> 00:07:11.275
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

00:07:11.515 --> 00:07:14.315
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

00:07:14.515 --> 00:07:20.635
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

00:07:20.875 --> 00:07:24.995
and it was a hill station.

00:07:25.195 --> 00:07:29.435
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

00:07:29.675 --> 00:07:32.835
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:34.635
so he had made arrangements for them.

00:07:34.835 --> 00:07:37.755
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

00:07:37.955 --> 00:07:40.955
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

00:07:41.155 --> 00:07:43.595
very hospitable.

00:07:43.915 --> 00:07:48.195
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

00:07:48.475 --> 00:07:49.995
where his guests could be.

00:07:50.195 --> 00:07:52.435
His brother had a big house

00:07:52.635 --> 00:07:57.075
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

00:07:57.355 --> 00:08:02.555
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:06.115
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

00:08:06.315 --> 00:08:07.435
which I have seen.

00:08:07.635 --> 00:08:10.955
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

00:08:11.155 --> 00:08:13.515
but I remember each and everything

00:08:13.955 --> 00:08:17.915
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

00:08:18.435 --> 00:08:24.555
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

00:08:24.795 --> 00:08:30.035
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

00:08:36.275 --> 00:08:39.915
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:42.235
to visit this place of My birth.

00:08:42.475 --> 00:08:46.235
I never expected that there would be so many people

00:08:46.475 --> 00:08:48.995
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

00:08:49.235 --> 00:08:52.155
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

00:08:52.395 --> 00:08:55.195
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

00:08:55.435 --> 00:08:57.875
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

00:08:58.115 --> 00:08:59.915
My father knew about My mission,

00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:02.315
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

00:09:02.515 --> 00:09:06.115
by which You can give Realization en masse.

00:09:06.355 --> 00:09:07.755
That was important, because

00:09:07.955 --> 00:09:11.475
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

00:09:11.675 --> 00:09:13.235
Also You should not write anything,

00:09:13.435 --> 00:09:16.835
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

00:09:17.035 --> 00:09:19.315
because books also bind them.

00:09:19.595 --> 00:09:23.875
So best thing is that You should take to...

00:09:24.475 --> 00:09:25.795
search of human beings,

00:09:25.995 --> 00:09:30.475
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

00:09:30.755 --> 00:09:33.395
because now You have come for that purpose."

00:09:33.635 --> 00:09:35.235
Somehow it worked it out,

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:37.835
and really it was surprising, I was really,

00:09:38.075 --> 00:09:40.155
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

00:09:40.355 --> 00:09:45.995
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

00:09:46.915 --> 00:09:50.355
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

00:09:50.915 --> 00:09:55.715
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

00:09:55.955 --> 00:09:57.515
that in the lifetime only,

00:09:57.755 --> 00:10:02.875
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

00:10:03.115 --> 00:10:05.155
It was such, such vibrations

00:10:05.395 --> 00:10:09.235
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

00:10:09.435 --> 00:10:14.075
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

00:10:14.315 --> 00:10:15.875
what was happening.

00:10:16.075 --> 00:10:19.875
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

00:10:20.115 --> 00:10:22.275
and a very humble house it was,

00:10:22.475 --> 00:10:25.635
but in those days it was the most,

00:10:26.355 --> 00:10:29.435
I mean, well-planned house as such,

00:10:29.675 --> 00:10:32.595
and was very much appreciated by people.

00:10:32.835 --> 00:10:36.995
And after that four years I was here,

00:10:37.795 --> 00:10:43.235
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

00:10:43.475 --> 00:10:45.315
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

00:10:45.515 --> 00:10:47.395
he had to go many times down,

00:10:47.595 --> 00:10:49.555
so they thought it's better to go.

00:10:49.795 --> 00:10:51.995
There also he had many houses,

00:10:52.235 --> 00:10:56.355
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

00:10:56.555 --> 00:11:01.275
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

00:11:02.075 --> 00:11:05.195
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

00:11:05.395 --> 00:11:09.755
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

00:11:10.195 --> 00:11:13.595
So this is a very novel thing,

00:11:13.795 --> 00:11:16.315
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

00:11:16.555 --> 00:11:20.155
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

00:11:20.395 --> 00:11:23.195
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

00:11:23.435 --> 00:11:24.714
So you can imagine.

00:11:24.915 --> 00:11:29.355
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

00:11:29.555 --> 00:11:31.155
but in a way we are there,

00:11:31.435 --> 00:11:37.155
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

00:11:39.235 --> 00:11:41.675
Today's puja I thought was best to have

00:11:41.875 --> 00:11:44.835
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

00:11:45.035 --> 00:11:48.635
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

00:11:48.835 --> 00:11:51.635
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

00:11:51.875 --> 00:11:55.675
It would be a nice thing to start with,

00:11:55.955 --> 00:11:58.035
and I, we have a doctor here.

00:11:58.275 --> 00:12:00.915
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

00:12:01.155 --> 00:12:04.075
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

00:12:04.275 --> 00:12:06.915
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

00:12:07.115 --> 00:12:11.555
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

00:12:12.915 --> 00:12:14.435
It's a, it was a jungle here.

00:12:14.635 --> 00:12:16.955
All around was jungles, hills,

00:12:17.155 --> 00:12:19.715
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

00:12:19.955 --> 00:12:24.435
And we used to get tigers and things;

00:12:24.635 --> 00:12:27.275
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

00:12:27.475 --> 00:12:30.155
where they could go see tigers,

00:12:30.795 --> 00:12:33.555
but now they are there no doubt,

00:12:33.755 --> 00:12:38.515
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

00:12:38.715 --> 00:12:41.475
they all go to some preserve places

00:12:41.675 --> 00:12:44.275
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:49.235
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

00:12:51.955 --> 00:12:55.875
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

00:12:56.075 --> 00:12:58.315
I am happy this has happened.

00:12:58.515 --> 00:13:02.115
It was a little circuitous and quite

00:13:04.275 --> 00:13:07.355
different from all the tours we have had so far,

00:13:08.714 --> 00:13:12.515
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

00:13:20.515 --> 00:13:22.595
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:25.235
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

00:13:25.475 --> 00:13:29.315
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

00:13:29.555 --> 00:13:33.395
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

00:13:33.675 --> 00:13:37.995
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

00:13:38.195 --> 00:13:39.715
All right.

00:13:45.555 --> 00:13:51.115
[Shri Mataji is starting to talk in Hindi for about 5 minutes}
