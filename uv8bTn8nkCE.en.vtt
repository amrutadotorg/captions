02:25.240 --> 02:30.677
Hindi

05:33.885 --> 05:35.885
I am sorry I was delayed.

05:36.075 --> 05:38.955
We were supposed to see the Collector and the

05:39.195 --> 05:41.475
Tahsildar, as they call him.

05:41.715 --> 05:44.875
They have done so much for us; so much they have organized,

05:45.075 --> 05:48.995
all the way, and officially they have done so well,

05:49.195 --> 05:53.955
that I had to wait for them to thank them very much.

05:54.995 --> 05:58.155
I think

05:58.755 --> 06:01.875
it's not very much hot for you, see the

06:02.115 --> 06:05.915
wind is blowing, can you imagine.

06:08.715 --> 06:15.035
And if you see, there's no, no leaves, leaves are not moving.

06:24.715 --> 06:27.955
You always used to go and sit in the sun,

06:28.155 --> 06:32.675
so now here it is, you'd better have some of it.

06:32.875 --> 06:37.595
I hope you all enjoyed your stay in Jabalpur

06:37.875 --> 06:40.395
and the visit to Jabalpur.

06:40.635 --> 06:44.475
It was quite interesting. Some people have not yet arrived.

06:44.755 --> 06:49.555
I am sorry to say they haven't been able to arrive

06:49.835 --> 06:53.235
from Bombay.

06:53.475 --> 06:57.755
I think they are more Bombayites, not from the foreign countries,

06:57.955 --> 07:01.835
but otherwise I think all of you are here.

07:02.075 --> 07:06.475
It's a very unusual thing to happen like this, you see,

07:06.714 --> 07:11.275
this My father built this house about eighty years back.

07:11.515 --> 07:14.315
He was very imaginative and fond of guests,

07:14.515 --> 07:20.635
so he also put up guest bedrooms and guest bathrooms, such,

07:20.875 --> 07:24.995
and it was a hill station.

07:25.195 --> 07:29.435
Now of course, because of crowdedness very cold and a hill station

07:29.675 --> 07:32.835
so people used to come, his friends used to come from Nagpur,

07:33.035 --> 07:34.635
so he had made arrangements for them.

07:34.835 --> 07:37.755
There were no hotels or anything so they used to have -

07:37.955 --> 07:40.955
and the people of this place are extremely hospitable,

07:41.155 --> 07:43.595
very hospitable.

07:43.915 --> 07:48.195
So it was his idea that he should have a house here

07:48.475 --> 07:49.995
where his guests could be.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.435
His brother had a big house

07:52.635 --> 07:57.075
but it was joint and he couldn't receive his guests,

07:57.355 --> 08:02.555
so he thought it's better to build a house here,

08:02.795 --> 08:06.115
and behind was a huge, big compound bigger than this,

08:06.315 --> 08:07.435
which I have seen.

08:07.635 --> 08:10.955
I was only four years of age when we went away from here,

08:11.155 --> 08:13.515
but I remember each and everything

08:13.955 --> 08:17.915
about this house, and everything about Chhindwara.

08:18.435 --> 08:24.555
And you know My memory is unusually, very, very sharp.

08:24.795 --> 08:30.035
I mean, I remember even My birth, it's to that extent.

08:36.275 --> 08:39.915
But I never knew that there would be so many saints coming

08:40.155 --> 08:42.235
to visit this place of My birth.

08:42.475 --> 08:46.235
I never expected that there would be so many people

08:46.475 --> 08:48.995
who will take to Sahaja Yoga in My lifetime,

08:49.235 --> 08:52.155
because when I was born I found people were so blind.

08:52.395 --> 08:55.195
I thought, "How will I talk about Sahaja Yog? What will I do?

08:55.435 --> 08:57.875
How will it work out? It's very difficult."

08:58.115 --> 08:59.915
My father knew about My mission,

09:00.115 --> 09:02.315
and he told Me that "You'd better find out a way

09:02.515 --> 09:06.115
by which You can give Realization en masse.

09:06.355 --> 09:07.755
That was important, because

09:07.955 --> 09:11.475
even if You give Realization one person, is of no use.

09:11.675 --> 09:13.235
Also You should not write anything,

09:13.435 --> 09:16.835
because You don't create another Bible, Gita, Koran,

09:17.035 --> 09:19.315
because books also bind them.

09:19.595 --> 09:23.875
So best thing is that You should take to...

09:24.475 --> 09:25.795
search of human beings,

09:25.995 --> 09:30.475
why they can't get it, their en masse Realization,

09:30.755 --> 09:33.395
because now You have come for that purpose."

09:33.635 --> 09:35.235
Somehow it worked it out,

09:35.475 --> 09:37.835
and really it was surprising, I was really,

09:38.075 --> 09:40.155
was not thinking to open Sahasrara,

09:40.355 --> 09:45.995
but I was literally forced into it and it worked out.

09:46.915 --> 09:50.355
It's working out. You can see, all of you are here.

09:50.915 --> 09:55.715
It's very amazing thing that can happen to someone like this,

09:55.955 --> 09:57.515
that in the lifetime only,

09:57.755 --> 10:02.875
you have come here to see this birthplace of Mine.

10:03.115 --> 10:05.155
It was such, such vibrations

10:05.395 --> 10:09.235
that My Sahasrara became completely jammed with vibrations.

10:09.435 --> 10:14.075
So cool inside, and outside was so hot that I didn't know

10:14.315 --> 10:15.875
what was happening.

10:16.075 --> 10:19.875
So I'm happy all of you could come and see this place,

10:20.115 --> 10:22.275
and a very humble house it was,

10:22.475 --> 10:25.635
but in those days it was the most,

10:26.355 --> 10:29.435
I mean, well-planned house as such,

10:29.675 --> 10:32.595
and was very much appreciated by people.

10:32.835 --> 10:36.995
And after that four years I was here,

10:37.795 --> 10:43.235
and then we went to Nagpur because we had a,

10:43.475 --> 10:45.315
My father had a big practice in Nagpur,

10:45.515 --> 10:47.395
he had to go many times down,

10:47.595 --> 10:49.555
so they thought it's better to go.

10:49.795 --> 10:51.995
There also he had many houses,

10:52.235 --> 10:56.355
and Babamama is going to take you round to see those houses.

10:56.555 --> 11:01.275
He says he'll find out time to see wherever I have lived.

11:02.075 --> 11:05.195
But Nagpur also is very vibrated place, you can feel it.

11:05.395 --> 11:09.755
People are very quiet, it's a very quiet place.

11:10.195 --> 11:13.595
So this is a very novel thing,

11:13.795 --> 11:16.315
I don't think it has happened in the lifetime of

11:16.555 --> 11:20.155
any one of the incarnations who came on this earth.

11:20.395 --> 11:23.195
Even for Rama Janma Bhoomi we are fighting even today.

11:23.435 --> 11:24.714
So you can imagine.

11:24.915 --> 11:29.355
Thank God, we have got this place - in a way. It's not yet ours,

11:29.555 --> 11:31.155
but in a way we are there,

11:31.435 --> 11:37.155
and maybe with your good wishes we'll own it very soon.

11:39.235 --> 11:41.675
Today's puja I thought was best to have

11:41.875 --> 11:44.835
Shri Ganesha Puja in a short way,

11:45.035 --> 11:48.635
because the first Puja here, and I was born here,

11:48.835 --> 11:51.635
so it's better that we should have a Ganesha Puja.

11:51.875 --> 11:55.675
It would be a nice thing to start with,

11:55.955 --> 11:58.035
and I, we have a doctor here.

11:58.275 --> 12:00.915
They are all Sahaja Yogis and they are going to help us

12:01.155 --> 12:04.075
to do the curing. Actually I always thought,

12:04.275 --> 12:06.915
"Which is the place where people will get cured?"

12:07.115 --> 12:11.555
So now we'll send all of them here to get cured.

12:12.915 --> 12:14.435
It's a, it was a jungle here.

12:14.635 --> 12:16.955
All around was jungles, hills,

12:17.155 --> 12:19.715
but I think all that's finished and broken now.

12:19.955 --> 12:24.435
And we used to get tigers and things;

12:24.635 --> 12:27.275
little far away from here is a place called Tamiya

12:27.475 --> 12:30.155
where they could go see tigers,

12:30.795 --> 12:33.555
but now they are there no doubt,

12:33.755 --> 12:38.515
but they are saying that nobody is now going that side,

12:38.715 --> 12:41.475
they all go to some preserve places

12:41.675 --> 12:44.275
which you have seen yourself, also Kanha Kisli.

12:44.595 --> 12:49.235
I hope you enjoyed. How did you enjoy Kanha Kisli?

12:51.955 --> 12:55.875
And the River Narmada also I was told you enjoyed very much.

12:56.075 --> 12:58.315
I am happy this has happened.

12:58.515 --> 13:02.115
It was a little circuitous and quite

13:04.275 --> 13:07.355
different from all the tours we have had so far,

13:08.714 --> 13:12.515
but I am happy you all have enjoyed it.

13:20.515 --> 13:22.595
I have said so many things about Shri Ganesh,

13:22.835 --> 13:25.235
I don't know what to say now, anymore,

13:25.475 --> 13:29.315
but all of you have seen that, a place, now see the -

13:29.555 --> 13:33.395
this breeze is coming from where? I don't know.

13:33.675 --> 13:37.995
You are sending breeze to Me, instead of I doing it.

13:38.195 --> 13:39.715
All right.

13:45.555 --> 13:51.115
