00:19:43.961 --> 00:19:44.794
- Today

00:19:45.471 --> 00:19:47.616
in this

00:19:47.616 --> 00:19:49.143
blessed place

00:19:49.144 --> 00:19:50.957
of Mahaganesha

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:52.516
we have all assembled

00:19:54.843 --> 00:19:57.071
to go deep into our own beings,

00:19:58.464 --> 00:19:59.789
To enjoy our own glory.

00:20:01.876 --> 00:20:03.006
One has to remember

00:20:05.166 --> 00:20:07.336
that the very first thing

00:20:08.226 --> 00:20:09.796
God created on this earth

00:20:09.796 --> 00:20:11.516
was Shri Ganesha

00:20:11.516 --> 00:20:13.843
because he could emit

00:20:14.926 --> 00:20:15.759
holiness.

00:20:23.976 --> 00:20:26.016
He exists as Chaitanya

00:20:27.458 --> 00:20:31.116
and this Chaitanya exists
in the atoms and molecules,

00:20:31.116 --> 00:20:32.426
As you know very well,

00:20:34.076 --> 00:20:37.199
As vibrations symmetric and isometric.

00:20:39.196 --> 00:20:40.396
These vibrations

00:20:44.656 --> 00:20:46.876
later on start expressing themselves

00:20:49.806 --> 00:20:51.066
in the plant kingdom

00:20:52.526 --> 00:20:53.789
as life force.

00:20:55.485 --> 00:20:58.897
And you see how they are

00:20:58.897 --> 00:21:00.499
kept under a bondage.

00:21:02.709 --> 00:21:04.096
A tree that is

00:21:05.176 --> 00:21:08.666
a mango tree will grow
up to a certain point.

00:21:15.503 --> 00:21:18.949
A coconut tree will grow
up to a certain point.

00:21:21.826 --> 00:21:23.156
It's all under control.

00:21:24.836 --> 00:21:28.496
And then it is expressed in the animals

00:21:30.016 --> 00:21:31.156
where it binds them.

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:34.199
That's why they're called
pashus, inside their bondage.

00:21:38.106 --> 00:21:41.356
But in the human beings, it is expressed as

00:21:42.819 --> 00:21:44.249
auspiciousness

00:21:45.501 --> 00:21:48.588
and ultimately as the epitome,

00:21:48.588 --> 00:21:49.588
as holiness.

00:21:52.179 --> 00:21:53.629
Holiness

00:21:55.201 --> 00:21:56.993
is to be understood

00:21:58.976 --> 00:22:02.893
in its essence as
well as in this context.

00:22:08.301 --> 00:22:12.051
Holiness is an innate
quality of personality.

00:22:14.726 --> 00:22:16.559
Where a person rejects

00:22:17.726 --> 00:22:19.519
all that is unholy,

00:22:21.996 --> 00:22:23.669
All that is inauspicious.

00:22:29.066 --> 00:22:30.876
The ego doesn't play any part.

00:22:31.986 --> 00:22:33.676
Up to the animal stage,

00:22:33.676 --> 00:22:35.636
ego doesn't exist.

00:22:35.636 --> 00:22:37.439
But in the human stage

00:22:39.076 --> 00:22:40.786
you are given freedom to choose

00:22:45.356 --> 00:22:48.376
whether you want holiness

00:22:48.376 --> 00:22:49.209
or not.

00:22:50.475 --> 00:22:52.439
But in the ego of man,

00:22:55.466 --> 00:22:56.299
he might say

00:22:56.299 --> 00:22:57.381
"what's wrong?"

00:23:01.682 --> 00:23:03.951
And he may fight

00:23:06.316 --> 00:23:08.648
All the rules and
regulations of the Divine

00:23:08.648 --> 00:23:11.239
And take to unholy behavior.

00:23:14.446 --> 00:23:16.100
But then he goes amok.

00:23:19.943 --> 00:23:22.486
Today we can see the results

00:23:23.396 --> 00:23:24.609
in this short time.

00:23:27.046 --> 00:23:27.879
The results

00:23:29.896 --> 00:23:31.159
of this defiance.

00:23:37.986 --> 00:23:39.136
In the West, especially,

00:23:40.696 --> 00:23:42.262
they're finding it impossible

00:23:42.262 --> 00:23:43.529
to retreat back.

00:23:45.030 --> 00:23:46.314
To begin with

00:23:47.196 --> 00:23:48.586
people laugh at such people.

00:23:50.713 --> 00:23:53.043
They make fun of them.

00:23:55.846 --> 00:23:59.529
but holiness is the power within us.

00:24:02.889 --> 00:24:04.766
As you have heard

00:24:04.766 --> 00:24:07.566
that Rajput ladies

00:24:07.566 --> 00:24:12.300
used to sacrifice their bodies so that

00:24:14.076 --> 00:24:18.299
nobody tries to destroy their holiness,

00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:19.857
Their chastity,

00:24:20.246 --> 00:24:23.913
because they realise the power that lies

00:24:23.914 --> 00:24:26.343
behind this chastity.

00:24:32.596 --> 00:24:35.386
This sense of chastity

00:24:39.786 --> 00:24:44.500
has helped so many women in this country

00:24:45.526 --> 00:24:48.543
to lead a very dynamic

00:24:49.886 --> 00:24:51.586
and holy life.

00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:59.115
It is said that without holiness

00:24:59.116 --> 00:25:03.570
you cannot work out

00:25:03.571 --> 00:25:05.486
anything.

00:25:07.929 --> 00:25:10.699
Even, I've heard that

00:25:10.700 --> 00:25:12.299
in India

00:25:12.300 --> 00:25:13.671
people believe

00:25:13.843 --> 00:25:17.043
that if you have to do wrestling,

00:25:17.214 --> 00:25:19.557
the wrestler has to be a holy person.

00:25:20.106 --> 00:25:23.643
If he's an unholy person, ultimately

00:25:23.644 --> 00:25:26.943
he will fail in life.

00:25:26.944 --> 00:25:30.186
Even those who play other games

00:25:30.186 --> 00:25:33.596
have to be holy like Hanumana,

00:25:33.596 --> 00:25:36.571
otherwise, they cannot

00:25:36.731 --> 00:25:39.942
continue with their games

00:25:39.943 --> 00:25:42.729
and they might develop
some sort of problems

00:25:42.730 --> 00:25:44.229
within themselves.

00:25:46.229 --> 00:25:51.186
The warriors who went on the wars

00:25:51.357 --> 00:25:52.929
and fought

00:25:53.814 --> 00:25:56.771
Other people had to lead a very holy life

00:25:57.276 --> 00:26:00.714
otherwise they would suffer.

00:26:01.043 --> 00:26:03.828
As you have seen people
coming back from Vietnam

00:26:03.829 --> 00:26:05.614
have become mad people.

00:26:08.286 --> 00:26:10.657
In every walk of life

00:26:11.057 --> 00:26:13.514
holiness was the most important part,

00:26:14.871 --> 00:26:16.929
Most important subject

00:26:17.471 --> 00:26:19.343
that was to be looked after.

00:26:22.014 --> 00:26:27.329
No reaction took place to
people who fought with Shivaji.

00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:34.071
But when I see the reaction of
war in some other countries,

00:26:34.386 --> 00:26:35.757
I'm quite surprised.

00:26:38.157 --> 00:26:39.700
The reason is

00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:41.929
while fighting the war

00:26:42.286 --> 00:26:44.642
they fell into a trap of their ego

00:26:44.643 --> 00:26:48.029
and did not care for their chastity.

00:26:49.257 --> 00:26:52.229
Chastity is not only meant for women.

00:26:52.429 --> 00:26:53.729
That's a very wrong idea.

00:26:53.876 --> 00:26:57.257
It's very much more for men.

00:26:57.400 --> 00:26:59.913
Those who lead a chaste life

00:26:59.914 --> 00:27:02.786
are the people who are glorious.

00:27:03.043 --> 00:27:06.186
Tejas Punja, as we call it.

00:27:09.979 --> 00:27:14.443
For Sahaja Yogis, the most important thing

00:27:14.614 --> 00:27:18.371
is to lead a very holy life.

00:27:18.443 --> 00:27:21.314
Everything else, is mundane.

00:27:26.243 --> 00:27:27.686
Christ,

00:27:27.687 --> 00:27:30.143
who came on this earth

00:27:30.243 --> 00:27:31.857
As I told you,

00:27:31.986 --> 00:27:33.942
was the incarnation of the same

00:27:33.943 --> 00:27:36.386
Holiness as Shri Ganesha.

00:27:36.629 --> 00:27:39.771
He had gone to this extent to say

00:27:39.843 --> 00:27:43.986
That thou shall not
have adulterous eyes.

00:27:44.771 --> 00:27:47.914
Even your eyes should be holy

00:27:50.243 --> 00:27:51.700
and innocent.

00:27:52.929 --> 00:27:55.729
Innocence gives you that holiness.

00:27:55.914 --> 00:27:58.356
As the children are

00:27:58.357 --> 00:28:00.171
holy people,

00:28:00.457 --> 00:28:01.857
because

00:28:02.014 --> 00:28:03.900
they are so innocent.

00:28:06.129 --> 00:28:09.857
There are so many things to
be learned from children.

00:28:09.858 --> 00:28:11.628
In their simplicity,

00:28:11.629 --> 00:28:13.629
In their innocence,

00:28:15.229 --> 00:28:18.943
They do not indulge into
things which are unholy.

00:28:20.557 --> 00:28:23.643
Holiness is not only concerned

00:28:25.714 --> 00:28:28.614
with your married life.

00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.814
Also, it's concerned
with your political life,

00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:36.600
With your economic life,

00:28:38.786 --> 00:28:40.743
With your national life.

00:28:45.900 --> 00:28:48.643
Chastity is the only keynote

00:28:49.457 --> 00:28:50.700
for improving

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:52.600
all the problems,

00:28:52.886 --> 00:28:55.514
all the problematic

00:28:57.829 --> 00:28:59.400
questions

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:02.543
or else solving them completely.

00:29:04.557 --> 00:29:09.171
There's only one danger
among chaste people also,

00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:13.114
that they might become extremely

00:29:13.300 --> 00:29:14.829
dry

00:29:14.929 --> 00:29:16.843
or could become

00:29:19.586 --> 00:29:21.757
very hot tempered.

00:29:21.943 --> 00:29:23.729
Sometimes also ego-oriented.

00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:27.243
But just the opposite of Shri Ganesha,

00:29:27.443 --> 00:29:29.000
who is on the left side.

00:29:29.543 --> 00:29:31.571
Shri Ganesha's holiness

00:29:31.643 --> 00:29:34.857
is that of a child, eternal childhood.

00:29:35.143 --> 00:29:36.400
It's so sweet.

00:29:38.186 --> 00:29:41.186
The whole movement of his body

00:29:41.187 --> 00:29:42.700
is so delicate

00:29:42.714 --> 00:29:44.557
and so sweet.

00:29:44.843 --> 00:29:45.900
Yet,

00:29:48.971 --> 00:29:50.843
so charming.

00:29:58.972 --> 00:30:00.714
He eats

00:30:00.715 --> 00:30:01.985
a Modaka

00:30:01.986 --> 00:30:03.071
which is a

00:30:03.072 --> 00:30:05.014
sweet which is

00:30:05.015 --> 00:30:06.428
very simple to make

00:30:06.429 --> 00:30:07.957
and very tasty.

00:30:10.414 --> 00:30:11.642
To show that

00:30:11.643 --> 00:30:13.470
we should have

00:30:13.471 --> 00:30:14.670
sweet

00:30:14.671 --> 00:30:16.299
temperament

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:17.900
Sweet nature.

00:30:22.586 --> 00:30:25.271
So the idea that people
who are very chaste

00:30:26.614 --> 00:30:29.386
are very rough, hot tempered

00:30:29.429 --> 00:30:31.457
is absolutely wrong.

00:30:31.786 --> 00:30:33.856
Especially for ladies.

00:30:33.857 --> 00:30:36.086
It's very important

00:30:37.257 --> 00:30:38.085
that

00:30:38.086 --> 00:30:39.799
if they have to

00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:41.199
understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:44.000
they must know that Shri Ganesha

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.542
works on the left side

00:30:46.543 --> 00:30:47.843
and not on the right side.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:54.371
This is a very big mistake

00:30:54.372 --> 00:30:57.142
when we start using
him on the right side.

00:30:57.671 --> 00:31:00.257
To express all our wisdom,

00:31:02.614 --> 00:31:04.157
All our love.

00:31:04.814 --> 00:31:06.671
Through holiness.

00:31:10.886 --> 00:31:13.685
There's no end to what I have to say about

00:31:13.686 --> 00:31:15.614
this great quality.

00:31:15.814 --> 00:31:18.843
Which all should imbibe,
respect and worship.

00:31:20.271 --> 00:31:22.314
Only thing,

00:31:22.414 --> 00:31:24.100
when you meditate,

00:31:26.042 --> 00:31:28.827
just believe

00:31:28.828 --> 00:31:31.885
that your auspiciousness

00:31:31.886 --> 00:31:33.599
and holiness

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:37.428
is to be imbibed on your nerves

00:31:37.429 --> 00:31:40.414
on your central nervous system,

00:31:40.586 --> 00:31:44.229
because that is the epitome of Chaitanya.

00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:46.957
The Chaitanya that is flowing all around

00:31:47.986 --> 00:31:49.129
if it is

00:31:49.757 --> 00:31:52.614
in the form of holiness

00:31:53.316 --> 00:31:56.543
even one glance of yours

00:31:57.153 --> 00:32:01.571
can bring beautiful fruits.

00:32:02.771 --> 00:32:05.700
Can bring peace and solace.

00:32:07.829 --> 00:32:09.257
So this

00:32:10.243 --> 00:32:11.886
innocence

00:32:13.543 --> 00:32:15.129
and holiness

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.957
Is the one which is peace-giving,

00:32:20.029 --> 00:32:23.450
Which reduces frictions, tensions,

00:32:24.943 --> 00:32:27.500
because you enjoy

00:32:27.943 --> 00:32:28.771
your

00:32:29.614 --> 00:32:31.229
chastity.

00:32:31.929 --> 00:32:34.799
Because you enjoy

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.357
your glory.

00:32:37.100 --> 00:32:39.271
Please aspire

00:32:41.014 --> 00:32:44.157
To be the epitome of holiness.

00:32:44.714 --> 00:32:46.214
May God bless you all

00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:49.243
(places her hands together in prayer)
