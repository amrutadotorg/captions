00:00:08.417 --> 00:00:12.680
Today is a great day to come to Brighton,

00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:18.721
because it’s the day of Buddha’s birthday.

00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:22.521
Today is Buddha's birthday, Lord Buddha's birthday.

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:29.251
We all have heard about His birth

00:00:31.209 --> 00:00:35.084
and that His mother dreamt of an elephant,

00:00:35.292 --> 00:00:41.709
of a large white elephant before the birth of Buddha.

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:47.584
And then it was predicted

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.875
that a child will be born in your family

00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:57.501
who will be either a great saint

00:00:58.251 --> 00:01:01.875
or a very great King,

00:01:02.084 --> 00:01:05.875
as in Sanskrit called ‘chakravarti' - means the one who

00:01:06.292 --> 00:01:10.459
is the ruler of the whole world.

00:01:13.292 --> 00:01:15.917
So the father got worried,

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:23.959
and he thought he must get the son involved into the family life,

00:01:24.668 --> 00:01:26.459
into material life

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.459
and give Him all the pleasures of life.

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:36.209
So he built a very special place for Him,

00:01:36.417 --> 00:01:39.125
a beautiful palace to live in.

00:01:40.125 --> 00:01:48.084
And where he got Him married to a girl called Yashodhara,

00:01:48.584 --> 00:01:50.709
was a very, very beautiful woman,

00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:53.668
gave Him all the pleasures of life,

00:01:53.875 --> 00:02:01.668
everything that he could do to entice this boy away from asceticism.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.709
Also you know the story of His going

00:02:08.917 --> 00:02:15.417
one day on the road, how He found three types of people,

00:02:15.668 --> 00:02:21.917
and how He felt that ‘Why a person should become old?'

00:02:22.125 --> 00:02:25.709
‘Why should a person suffer in life?

00:02:26.167 --> 00:02:29.251
and ‘Why should people die?’.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:37.292
So all these three things put an enquiry into Himself

00:02:37.626 --> 00:02:41.334
and He started trying to understand

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:44.709
why these things happen to human beings.

00:02:44.917 --> 00:02:47.292
With this the enquiry started.

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:53.917
So He reached a point where

00:02:54.125 --> 00:03:01.251
He could not bear any more the comforts and the, all the attachments

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.584
that were entangled around him by His father.

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:08.334
He had a son whose name was Rahul;

00:03:08.542 --> 00:03:16.251
and He left the son and the wife in the search of the truth.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:24.292
Now, He started from a wrong end, I should say,

00:03:24.501 --> 00:03:27.626
for the search of the truth because

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:32.042
He wanted to know, why there are miseries in the human beings.

00:03:32.251 --> 00:03:39.709
And so He started from collective towards the center.

00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:42.334
When we see miseries all around us,

00:03:42.542 --> 00:03:45.209
many people I have seen, they say: “What about others?

00:03:45.417 --> 00:03:47.251
Will everybody get realization?

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.501
Will everybody will have this, you see?

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.000
This comes from the wrong end I feel because

00:03:55.292 --> 00:04:00.334
first of all we must know, are we all right?

00:04:01.833 --> 00:04:05.709
Have we - are we perfect?

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:08.750
Are we full of joy?

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:14.709
Have we received the absolute knowledge?

00:04:14.917 --> 00:04:19.542
If you start from this point, it’s always better.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.833
Because He started from the wrong point,

00:04:23.042 --> 00:04:25.875
searching it from the collective

00:04:26.084 --> 00:04:28.417
to remove the miseries of the people

00:04:28.626 --> 00:04:31.875
He had to go in a very round about way.

00:04:32.417 --> 00:04:36.542
So He read all the books and Vedas and this,

00:04:36.709 --> 00:04:39.542
He went to big pundits,

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:46.417
to all the great knowledgeable people to meet them,

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:53.209
to ask them the answer, “Why there are these three things?”

00:04:53.709 --> 00:05:00.709
that is the ‘roga’, is the

00:05:02.709 --> 00:05:07.833
health or miserable physical body,

00:05:08.376 --> 00:05:13.542
then the death and the old age.

00:05:14.709 --> 00:05:17.501
He went and asked so many people

00:05:17.709 --> 00:05:21.792
And they said: “You have to die because your are born."

00:05:22.292 --> 00:05:25.584
And then they said that you have to

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:30.875
become old because you are born like that

00:05:31.334 --> 00:05:33.626
and you have to suffer

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:36.084
because you commit sins.

00:05:36.292 --> 00:05:39.209
He was not satisfied with this answer.

00:05:39.959 --> 00:05:44.292
So He went on searching and searching and searching.

00:05:44.626 --> 00:05:48.209
Then He got tired, absolutely fed up.

00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:54.542
Then He went to a place called Gaya, very near

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:58.792
Patna it is, I've seen the place and the tree.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:07.125
And He sat under a banyan tree where He slept off,

00:06:07.334 --> 00:06:11.209
because He got so tired of His seeking.

00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:14.459
And after the sleep He got up

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:18.542
and suddenly He got His Realization.

00:06:18.709 --> 00:06:23.209
And He thought the whole drama is over.

00:06:23.417 --> 00:06:28.459
Now His Mother Herself was Adishakti, who gave Him the birth

00:06:28.668 --> 00:06:31.417
and She died just after the birth of the child.

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:36.792
And He got His Realization.

00:06:37.167 --> 00:06:41.209
Now at that time when He got His Realization

00:06:41.417 --> 00:06:45.376
there was nobody to tell Him what it is,

00:06:45.584 --> 00:06:49.376
that what it means Realization is.

00:06:49.584 --> 00:06:50.750
Nobody to decode

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:56.875
or talk about anything that was to be understood by Him.

00:06:57.167 --> 00:07:01.209
But because of His tremendous seeking

00:07:01.417 --> 00:07:05.959
and such ardent desire

00:07:06.376 --> 00:07:12.376
that the shuddha iccha, the Kundalini itself rose,

00:07:12.584 --> 00:07:14.626
but of course the Adishakti blessed Him

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:18.833
and He got His Realization under the banyan tree.

00:07:21.833 --> 00:07:25.626
Now any incarnation, which came on this Earth

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:31.584
had to 'samayachara' - according to the time,

00:07:32.125 --> 00:07:36.042
the need of the time had to act firstly,

00:07:36.292 --> 00:07:43.000
secondly the need of the

00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:45.875
incarnation to come on this earth

00:07:46.125 --> 00:07:50.501
was first created in the human beings.

00:07:50.709 --> 00:07:55.668
So supposing at a time when there was too much of ritualism,

00:07:55.875 --> 00:07:59.750
Brahmanism or priesthood

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:04.584
and people were trying to take everything

00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:09.750
onto those artificial rituals and all that,

00:08:09.959 --> 00:08:17.125
an incarnation had to come on this earth to correct those ideas.

00:08:17.334 --> 00:08:21.626
Like Krishna came at a time when He said, “This is all leela",

00:08:21.833 --> 00:08:23.833
the puja and everything He canceled.

00:08:24.042 --> 00:08:26.334
Nothing doing, no puja nothing,

00:08:26.584 --> 00:08:30.000
you just have raas, enjoy yourself.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:32.251
It's all a joke going on, you see.

00:08:32.459 --> 00:08:38.167
So He brought that concept at that time in the awareness of people

00:08:38.376 --> 00:08:41.125
that the whole world is a leela,

00:08:41.334 --> 00:08:45.750
is a play of God's own whims.

00:08:45.959 --> 00:08:47.709
So you just enjoy it.

00:08:48.417 --> 00:08:54.709
And that's how He created this wonderful festival of Holi,

00:08:54.917 --> 00:08:56.626
which we had

00:08:56.833 --> 00:09:01.209
in Delhi. I don’t know- anyone of you was there for the Holi? No.

00:09:01.417 --> 00:09:02.167
You were there?

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.501
Sahaja Yogi: Two years back.

00:09:04.709 --> 00:09:07.084
Shri Mataji: No, but this time you were not there.All right.

00:09:07.292 --> 00:09:10.584
You might get the pictures of that. All right.

00:09:10.792 --> 00:09:14.501
So in the same way when Buddha came in

00:09:14.833 --> 00:09:17.584
first problem was that

00:09:17.792 --> 00:09:21.917
He thought that it's better not to talk about God.

00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:25.501
Because in His search everybody told Him

00:09:25.709 --> 00:09:29.584
the answer was, “Oh it’s God who does it.

00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:34.042
He punishes you. It’s God who gives you this old age.

00:09:34.251 --> 00:09:36.750
It’s God who does it.“ But what is this God after all?

00:09:36.959 --> 00:09:39.042
Why does He do it?” They said, “You better ask the God."

00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:42.042
“Where is the God?”

00:09:42.251 --> 00:09:46.833
So everybody put every blame on God, as usual.

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:51.084
Even that’s done today, nothing so, so new

00:09:51.334 --> 00:09:54.542
and nothing unusual I should say.

00:09:54.709 --> 00:09:57.959
So this must be done by God, you see.

00:09:58.167 --> 00:09:59.501
If you cut your throat:

00:09:59.709 --> 00:10:04.750
‘God put my knife in my hand and He cut my throat’.

00:10:05.125 --> 00:10:09.125
So you see, He thought better not talk of God.

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:12.459
Because everybody is going towards God.

00:10:12.833 --> 00:10:15.292
Then the people whom He met they said,

00:10:15.501 --> 00:10:18.042
“Now I have become God.” He said, “How?”

00:10:18.251 --> 00:10:20.792
He said: "I am God now.” “For what? Why?”

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.959
Because he could mesmerize people,

00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:27.125
he said: “I have become God.” Just imagine!

00:10:27.334 --> 00:10:30.709
So He thought that it’s very dangerous to talk of God

00:10:30.917 --> 00:10:33.959
because people take God in the hand and use it

00:10:34.167 --> 00:10:35.709
for their own purpose,

00:10:35.917 --> 00:10:40.376
always say, “Oh this is what the God has to do

00:10:40.584 --> 00:10:42.125
and it’s God has

00:10:42.334 --> 00:10:44.750
done it and I’m in connection with God and I’ll tell God.”

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:48.875
So He got a fright and He said that, “Better not talk about God.

00:10:49.084 --> 00:10:52.626
Because that puts the attention of the people on ritualism,

00:10:52.833 --> 00:10:56.417
artificial things, they are building temples after temples,

00:10:56.626 --> 00:10:59.000
and just doing all these horrible things

00:10:59.334 --> 00:11:05.125
which one should not do. Like if you go to the south you’ll find

00:11:05.334 --> 00:11:08.917
in the temples they shave their heads of the ladies,

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:11.501
they shave it completely.

00:11:11.709 --> 00:11:13.376
And they have to -

00:11:13.584 --> 00:11:17.167
it’s all cobbled along the sides of the wall,

00:11:17.376 --> 00:11:19.792
some walls of the temple.

00:11:20.084 --> 00:11:22.792
And the ladies who shaved their heads

00:11:23.084 --> 00:11:26.334
are just rolling along the sides, you see.

00:11:26.455 --> 00:11:30.830
They have to do sometimes 1008 times, rolling - imagine,

00:11:31.251 --> 00:11:33.584
and the water is poured on them.

00:11:33.792 --> 00:11:37.251
God knows what is the ritual, from where it has come!

00:11:37.542 --> 00:11:40.542
So the poor women go on rolling, rolling, rolling like that

00:11:40.709 --> 00:11:43.084
and somebody is pouring water on them all the time,

00:11:43.292 --> 00:11:44.626
buckets after buckets.

00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:48.334
Her husband and her brother and all they’re doing one after another,

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:49.917
you see one is finished then another one.

00:11:50.125 --> 00:11:51.833
Poor ladies rolling like that,

00:11:52.042 --> 00:11:57.709
on that muddy sort of a cobbled area.

00:11:58.167 --> 00:12:00.792
I mean, I was shocked when I saw this.  I said: “What’s this?”

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.251
And then later on you see they became modern,

00:12:04.542 --> 00:12:08.376
so they started selling the hair, you see, abroad,

00:12:08.584 --> 00:12:12.501
so the whole thing became a big industry in Madras, you see,

00:12:12.709 --> 00:12:17.042
the hair was made into this bouffant and all they call it, here,

00:12:17.251 --> 00:12:21.125
and they sent it to England and other places.

00:12:21.376 --> 00:12:26.251
So it’s, I mean, in the name of God ridiculous things were done,

00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:28.750
ridiculous things were done!

00:12:28.959 --> 00:12:30.959
So He just thought: Better not talk about God.

00:12:31.167 --> 00:12:34.376
The first step is Self-Realization.

00:12:34.668 --> 00:12:36.750
He was a great Sahaja Yogi I must say.

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:39.709
Because He said nothing doing, don't talk about God or anything,

00:12:39.917 --> 00:12:42.459
first you get your Realization.

00:12:42.668 --> 00:12:46.084
That was the first condition, establish it.

00:12:46.292 --> 00:12:49.376
Unless and until you have established your Realization,

00:12:49.584 --> 00:12:50.542
- nothing doing.

00:12:50.709 --> 00:12:58.167
So He just started His own method of propagating Buddhi

00:12:58.417 --> 00:13:01.501
Buddha's knowledge or you can Buddhism you can say as they call it.

00:13:01.709 --> 00:13:03.584
Of course it became ‘ism’ later on.

00:13:03.792 --> 00:13:06.084
So all that He started

00:13:06.292 --> 00:13:10.542
with the idea that people should first become Buddha.

00:13:10.709 --> 00:13:15.251
Buddha means realized, Buddha is ‘to know’.

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:19.000
So "Buddha" means the person who has known,

00:13:19.209 --> 00:13:22.334
means the one who is a Realized soul.

00:13:22.584 --> 00:13:26.376
So what He says, “Buddham Sharanam Gachhami”,

00:13:26.584 --> 00:13:29.750
I bow, no I surrender – ‘sharanam’ means surrender,

00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:36.292
I surrender to the Buddhas - means to all the Sahaja Yogis.
