00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360
But if your attention is passing through the centre

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.470
of the Agnya chakra

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.108
you don’t see any light.

00:00:10.108 --> 00:00:12.368
But if it is not passing through that,

00:00:12.378 --> 00:00:15.105
then what happens, because your attention is outside,

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:16.135
you see the light.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:19.274
Because it is enlightening also, you see.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.716
And you just see the light but the Kundalini is not passing through,

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:24.114
just it’s stuck up there.

00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:26.024
And that’s why, because of that light,

00:00:26.021 --> 00:00:28.137
your eyes go on like that, you see.

00:00:28.157 --> 00:00:34.125
People have seen even a complete flow of light

00:00:34.115 --> 00:00:35.566
moving up like that.

00:00:35.557 --> 00:00:38.006
But they have not felt the Realisation.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.515
They saw it coming up to the Agnya

00:00:40.511 --> 00:00:42.451
and then the whole thing drops back.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.542
They saw it!

00:00:43.561 --> 00:00:46.212
They saw the Kundalini how it was helping,

00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:50.631
the Adi Kundalini was helping your Kundalini – they saw it.

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:55.682
Even this light rising is because of that. Because your attention is still outside, you see.

00:00:55.695 --> 00:00:58.773
So you go on, the flickering of the eyes starts.

00:00:58.795 --> 00:01:01.652
Then I tell you to fix up your eyes onto my finger.

00:01:01.661 --> 00:01:04.572
When you fix it up onto my finger and my face,

00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:09.006
what happens the chaitanya pushes you, through your eyes, into the centre, you see.

00:01:09.013 --> 00:01:11.162
So that you see me as I am.

00:01:11.191 --> 00:01:14.974
But the eyes are controlled by the chaitanya

00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:19.563
and the attention that is inside is pushed inside that,

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:24.920
what you call the apparition, in the Agnya chakra

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.712
So I always say that if you are flickering your eyes,

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:31.358
please pay attention to me, so that the chaitanya works out through your eyes

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.858
and fixes your attention to pass through.

00:01:33.878 --> 00:01:39.162
Because the light starts spreading on all the sides and you see that light and the eyes go on like that;

00:01:39.212 --> 00:01:41.441
you cannot close your eyes.

00:01:41.432 --> 00:01:43.361
Which is, that is the reason for that.

00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:46.215
Then the second thing you said that

00:01:46.287 --> 00:01:48.465
you are facing:

00:01:48.527 --> 00:01:51.537
your Sahasrara was on the thing.

00:01:51.587 --> 00:01:53.953
Yes, one of the reasons for nirvichara is that.

00:01:53.938 --> 00:01:59.117
But also nirvichara is a way to express the blessings of your Mother.

00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:02.429
When She wants to bless you. See, you wrote the letter She was happy.

00:02:02.459 --> 00:02:05.143
Just to bless you, you became nirvichar.

00:02:05.152 --> 00:02:06.697
You see, it’s a blessing.

00:02:06.697 --> 00:02:11.181
That’s how you get the grace, you see, that comes to you from your Mother,

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.562
that you become nirvichar, that's that one has to recognise.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.393
If you do the things that I tell you,

00:02:16.401 --> 00:02:18.419
I feel I bless you very much,

00:02:18.453 --> 00:02:20.010
because they are for your good,

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.911
for your kalyana

00:02:20.919 --> 00:02:22.431
for your mangal (auspiciousness)

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.518
and that’s why you are blessed and that blessing you feel as nirvichara.

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:29.941
Because I am Nirvichara myself.

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:32.611
Yes. Come along.

00:02:33.591 --> 00:02:36.830
I’m Douglas Fry, one of the early Sahaja yogis from London.

00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:39.275
And what I would like to say is,

00:02:39.335 --> 00:02:43.865
it’s rather amazing the way that the forces of good

00:02:43.925 --> 00:02:46.014
and the forces of bad

00:02:46.074 --> 00:02:50.361
have nevertheless, pushed us towards Mataji.

00:02:50.348 --> 00:02:54.145
Now the person that introduced us to Mataji,

00:02:54.156 --> 00:02:56.615
as you have heard from Gavin,

00:02:56.604 --> 00:02:59.455
was a yoga ‘playboy’. Now....

00:02:59.466 --> 00:03:00.617
And who was that?

00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:01.958
A yoga playboy.

00:03:03.487 --> 00:03:04.693
A guru or something.

00:03:04.764 --> 00:03:07.955
Yes, he was, he was no doubt, and is still!

00:03:08.775 --> 00:03:13.491
The reason he came to England…

00:03:13.502 --> 00:03:15.513
…was to make some money out of yoga!

00:03:15.592 --> 00:03:21.573
The reason he came to England was because he’d seen this particular fake guru

00:03:21.591 --> 00:03:24.693
with the long hair, that looked like a pop star.

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:32.252
He told me, and I think he might have told some of the others of us,

00:03:32.264 --> 00:03:37.633
that this particular guru had said to him,

00:03:37.685 --> 00:03:40.175
“You should go to England.”

00:03:40.245 --> 00:03:45.580
So, obviously he came to England and started yoga classes.

00:03:45.603 --> 00:03:49.508
Now, where the yoga classes started

00:03:49.501 --> 00:03:55.621
was the last place that you could teach yoga because it was very, very cold

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:58.896
and we started in winter,

00:03:58.896 --> 00:04:00.295
and there was no heating on.

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:06.387
But for some reason, the yoga classes still went on.

00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:09.230
Now, eventually,

00:04:09.292 --> 00:04:13.353
he met Mataji and tried his experiment on us.

00:04:13.401 --> 00:04:22.305
And we all felt coolness in the hands, we all got Realisation.

00:04:22.415 --> 00:04:29.110
Now, another thing that this yoga playboy had tried

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.358
was Transcendental Meditation, I found out.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.505
Now, after us having got Realisation,

00:04:36.507 --> 00:04:39.435
he tried to teach us meditation

00:04:39.456 --> 00:04:42.257
and the technique that he was trying to do

00:04:42.326 --> 00:04:46.737
was a technique used by TM.

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:51.317
The TM people, they give you a mantra, they might make the mantra up themselves.

00:04:51.377 --> 00:04:55.698
Or sometimes they give you names that sounds a bit like Sanskrit.

00:04:55.638 --> 00:05:00.555
In fact, I heard one fellow who had a mantra that sounded like “key ring”.

00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:04.211
"Keyring!"

00:05:06.355 --> 00:05:10.630
If you pronounce it strangely it can sort of sound like...

00:05:10.658 --> 00:05:13.238
If you pronounce it strangely, it can sound a bit like Indian

00:05:13.264 --> 00:05:15.940
but that’s neither here nor there.

00:05:15.951 --> 00:05:18.872
So this fellow was trying to teach us

00:05:18.932 --> 00:05:22.192
he was trying to use Transcendental Meditation techniques

00:05:22.211 --> 00:05:24.411
to make us go into meditation.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.906
And he told us that we should concentrate on a word,

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:30.146
a word that we think is nice.

00:05:30.146 --> 00:05:34.680
Now the particular word I used was ‘divine’.

00:05:34.687 --> 00:05:37.850
Now we sat down there

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.545
for about ten... we sat down

00:05:40.571 --> 00:05:43.685
for about ten or fifteen minutes to meditate

00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:49.721
and I remember I had my head... I felt an explosion,

00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:52.363
that finished in my head.

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:54.940
Now I did not know the time that it was

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.512
so I said, “I felt this explosion in my head, what was it?”

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:02.579
So he said, “Oh, I don’t think that was anything, you forget about it!”

00:06:05.187 --> 00:06:09.725
Now,

00:06:09.754 --> 00:06:19.024
once again, I think perhaps, just for a split of a second, I had achieved thoughtless awareness

00:06:19.084 --> 00:06:21.855
and my Kundalini obviously had risen.

00:06:21.884 --> 00:06:25.194
And then, at a later date,

00:06:25.225 --> 00:06:30.132
once I was asleep, I actually saw my Kundalini rise.

00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:34.964
So my head was full of an intense white flame

00:06:34.987 --> 00:06:37.028
and then it went down again

00:06:37.038 --> 00:06:39.437
and then it came up again.

00:06:39.447 --> 00:06:43.968
And then I heard a “ting” from the top of my head.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:47.877
That is a ting.  That’s not Kundalini, you see, this is the thing

00:06:47.891 --> 00:06:50.591
This I assumed to be the breaking of the brahmarandhra

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.682
No, no.

00:06:51.682 --> 00:06:52.372
This wasn't.

00:06:52.372 --> 00:06:53.362
It is not.

00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:56.024
This is what happens to so many people, you see,

00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:58.904
that is always the ida and pingala nadi.

00:06:58.901 --> 00:07:00.414
This is?

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.754
This is ida pingala

00:07:01.774 --> 00:07:02.923
Oh, I see, pardon me.

00:07:02.934 --> 00:07:04.044
The sympathetic.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.021
That works out and it looks like Kundalini.

00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:10.053
But you don’t get any vibrations in the hand or head. It looks like.....

00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:13.927
You know, some people get a big hole here, down below.

00:07:13.934 --> 00:07:16.653
Especially this Muktananda he does like that.

00:07:16.713 --> 00:07:19.163
And they get a feeling like that you know.

00:07:19.244 --> 00:07:23.803
You should never feel the Kundalini rising like an explosion in a block like that.

00:07:23.874 --> 00:07:24.963
Oh, I see

00:07:24.908 --> 00:07:28.019
Later on, after Realisation, you may feel the slow movement.

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:30.790
But normally in Realisation you do not

00:07:32.865 --> 00:07:36.704
Well, anyway, that’s all I want to say.

00:07:36.735 --> 00:07:39.875
Thank you very much.

00:07:39.894 --> 00:07:41.914
What about Sahaj Yog?

00:07:43.154 --> 00:07:46.411
Well, anyway, after all this experience

00:07:46.482 --> 00:07:56.593
initially of course I was in quite a mess, I used to take drugs and drink as many of the Western people seem to do these days.

00:07:56.601 --> 00:07:58.759
And gradually I found,

00:07:58.762 --> 00:08:02.809
after being exposed to Mataji’s love and Mataji’s influence,

00:08:02.822 --> 00:08:07.019
I found that gradually my interest in drugs,

00:08:07.033 --> 00:08:10.249
my interest in drinking and smoking, it all dropped out

00:08:10.273 --> 00:08:14.608
and I gradually became more and more stable.

00:08:14.639 --> 00:08:25.988
And now, I find that life for me is very settled and…

00:08:26.007 --> 00:08:27.598
you can give Realisation.

00:08:27.658 --> 00:08:32.015
I find that I can give Realisation to people and it's...

00:08:32.015 --> 00:08:33.395
I can cure also.

00:08:33.446 --> 00:08:35.566
And yes, also I have to say I can cure people

00:08:35.638 --> 00:08:42.347
and I find it... the first time I gave Realisation to somebody, I was quite amazed

00:08:42.437 --> 00:08:46.417
and just to realise I could do such a thing.

00:08:46.437 --> 00:08:50.096
But now, to give Realisation it’s still, you know,

00:08:50.105 --> 00:08:54.525
it still makes me feel very nice and clean inside,

00:08:54.567 --> 00:08:58.403
and it’s just, just wonderful.

00:09:05.869 --> 00:09:08.768
This kind of experience many people get,

00:09:08.783 --> 00:09:13.233
like Shri Krishna also had like that and so many people get a feeling like that,

00:09:13.323 --> 00:09:15.766
that something goes up, suddenly shoots off,

00:09:15.826 --> 00:09:18.766
and you feel exploded and opened out and all that.

00:09:18.816 --> 00:09:20.516
But that is not the Kundalini.

00:09:20.566 --> 00:09:23.083
It is the sympathetic nervous system

00:09:23.133 --> 00:09:25.953
which is very much in strain.

00:09:25.963 --> 00:09:27.790
You see her strain.

00:09:27.793 --> 00:09:31.460
And in that expression of that strain, what happens

00:09:31.463 --> 00:09:35.932
that the whole thing, the energy of the complete sympathetic,

00:09:35.992 --> 00:09:40.171
whatever they have in the parasympathetic is sucked in,

00:09:40.181 --> 00:09:41.721
into the sympathetic.

00:09:41.711 --> 00:09:44.391
Because the sympathetic is too much activated, you see.

00:09:44.421 --> 00:09:47.841
Then what happens the parasympathetic system has

00:09:47.841 --> 00:09:49.761
your stored up energy, whatever it is.

00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:52.890
So it just sucks in all that

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.649
and when it is sucked in,

00:09:54.660 --> 00:10:02.449
suddenly, the wave from the pelvic plexus, down below starts.

00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:08.859
Because, you see, all the energies are released to the sympathetic.

00:10:08.919 --> 00:10:11.430
Because the sympathetic is so exhausted

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:16.588
that whatever is the energy left in the chakras is released.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.338
Once it is released, you see,

00:10:18.343 --> 00:10:21.327
all that released energy you see, makes you feel

00:10:21.317 --> 00:10:24.817
that the energy is rising within you because it is rising through ida and pingala.

00:10:24.867 --> 00:10:29.716
Now this is the energy which is just sucked into ida and pingala. It rises up.

00:10:29.722 --> 00:10:32.622
And you can feel it going up and coming down and all that.

00:10:32.672 --> 00:10:37.327
But the after effects of this one is this,

00:10:37.332 --> 00:10:45.875
that such a person – of course in these experiences people feel sometimes a horrible thing also,

00:10:45.935 --> 00:10:48.965
that they feel that there’s a heat liberation,

00:10:49.015 --> 00:10:53.845
sometimes they feel some sort of a scorpion bites going on

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:57.072
or some snakes coming up and all kind of things can happen in this.

00:10:57.085 --> 00:10:59.004
It can be very horrifying also, this one,

00:10:59.018 --> 00:11:01.768
and could be very simple also.

00:11:01.794 --> 00:11:06.558
But when this happens, the after effect is like that, that you become arbitrary.

00:11:07.484 --> 00:11:13.117
It is sort of all this drugs system started after that,

00:11:13.105 --> 00:11:17.455
because once you are released from that self-control in between,

00:11:17.525 --> 00:11:20.285
you can take to anything like this,

00:11:20.355 --> 00:11:23.486
because you are free now to do whatever you please you see.

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:25.766
And that’s how you can take to drugs and things.

00:11:25.786 --> 00:11:29.726
And this is what all these gurus are doing,

00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.382
is to take out this stored energy which is controlling you,

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:35.312
suck them out onto the sympathetic.

00:11:35.402 --> 00:11:37.442
There are so many ways by which they can do it:

00:11:37.442 --> 00:11:39.042
they can starve you,

00:11:39.092 --> 00:11:41.322
they can make you work very hard,

00:11:41.372 --> 00:11:42.935
they can make you tired,

00:11:43.005 --> 00:11:49.469
they can make you say some mantras, things. I mean they make your sympathetic work so hard

00:11:49.469 --> 00:11:52.040
that ultimately a stage is reached where

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.539
your chakras release all the energy that is stored in them

00:11:55.536 --> 00:11:57.529
and just get out of it, you see.

00:11:57.569 --> 00:12:02.489
So all this energy they will suck in and a person feels: “Oh, suddenly something has happened!”

00:12:02.479 --> 00:12:07.485
But in these circumstances, you see, you may have a big hollow in the head like that,

00:12:07.535 --> 00:12:11.055
as if, like a mad person has, here, a big hollow.

00:12:11.115 --> 00:12:15.055
And the whole thing is sucked in and you get a hollow there like that.

00:12:15.059 --> 00:12:16.507
So many people get this thing,

00:12:16.557 --> 00:12:21.682
that is a very different thing. But because all the energy that was inside is sucked in.

00:12:21.697 --> 00:12:25.502
So it has become like a big hollow inside, you see.

00:12:25.513 --> 00:12:28.342
Like a mad person has too, the same thing.

00:12:28.363 --> 00:12:35.557
So this is the way people confuse between Kundalini awakening and the exhaustion of the sympathetic.

00:12:35.523 --> 00:12:40.237
Normally the Kundalini awakening through Sahaj Yoga, you do not feel anything.

00:12:40.246 --> 00:12:42.486
It just goes up and works out.

00:12:42.536 --> 00:12:45.286
But sometimes, if there is, after Realisation,

00:12:45.356 --> 00:12:49.573
if there is an obstruction due to certain combinations,

00:12:49.569 --> 00:12:52.139
it may be the obstruction may go out like that.

00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:54.721
But there’s a tremendous difference between the two.

00:12:54.719 --> 00:12:59.531
That first, you release in the hands, of the vibrations, start with that.

00:12:59.539 --> 00:13:03.071
But with the first one you do not get, on the contrary, you get heated up

00:13:03.141 --> 00:13:06.351
and you start avoiding yourself, escaping from yourself.

00:13:06.361 --> 00:13:09.711
And this starts. And that’s how you get into these drugs

00:13:09.729 --> 00:13:14.789
This is very much played by the gurus. You see, that’s what they do to you.

00:13:14.869 --> 00:13:20.375
They exhaust you completely, so that you cannot withstand reality and the present moment.

00:13:20.406 --> 00:13:22.575
And so you try to get into something.

00:13:22.586 --> 00:13:25.993
And once you try to escape it, you see, you just...

00:13:25.993 --> 00:13:30.469
the whole release of the stores and parasympathetic takes place

00:13:30.486 --> 00:13:32.063
and the Deities are broken

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:33.833
and you are broken, you become arbitrary.

00:13:33.883 --> 00:13:36.113
It’s a cancerous sort of a thing.

00:13:36.183 --> 00:13:38.816
So that’s not Kundalini awakening but we would say,

00:13:38.829 --> 00:13:43.256
it is more a sympathetic system which comes into play

00:13:43.279 --> 00:13:48.624
and the movement of peristaltic, what you call that ‘pumping’ up.

00:13:48.644 --> 00:13:52.803
Peristaltic movements of the pumping up of the energy starts.

00:13:52.804 --> 00:13:55.314
They start putting it into the thing.

00:13:55.374 --> 00:13:59.623
And the whole thing is sucked in because of the exhaustion.

00:13:59.630 --> 00:14:01.680
So one should not confuse between the two.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:05.544
Because after Realisation you cannot take to drugs and things easily.

00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:07.043
It’s very difficult..

00:14:08.403 --> 00:14:11.343
You have to really force yourself to take to drugs.

00:14:13.334 --> 00:14:18.638
Mother, you just answered now something that I never questioned because after I met you I did not want to question it.

00:14:18.698 --> 00:14:27.448
I had, two years before meeting you, I had an extremely powerful experience of the same kind…
