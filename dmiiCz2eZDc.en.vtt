WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.360
But if your attention is passing through the centre

00:07.370 --> 00:08.470
of the Agnya chakra

00:08.470 --> 00:10.108
you don’t see any light.

00:10.108 --> 00:12.368
But if it is not passing through that,

00:12.378 --> 00:15.105
then what happens, because your attention is outside,

00:15.108 --> 00:16.135
you see the light.

00:16.129 --> 00:19.274
Because it is enlightening also, you see.

00:19.280 --> 00:22.716
And you just see the light but the Kundalini is not passing through,

00:22.721 --> 00:24.114
just it’s stuck up there.

00:24.131 --> 00:26.024
And that’s why, because of that light,

00:26.021 --> 00:28.137
your eyes go on like that, you see.

00:28.157 --> 00:34.125
People have seen even a complete flow of light

00:34.115 --> 00:35.566
moving up like that.

00:35.557 --> 00:38.006
But they have not felt the Realisation.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.515
They saw it coming up to the Agnya

00:40.511 --> 00:42.451
and then the whole thing drops back.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.542
They saw it!

00:43.561 --> 00:46.212
They saw the Kundalini how it was helping,

00:46.231 --> 00:50.631
the Adi Kundalini was helping your Kundalini – they saw it.

00:50.645 --> 00:55.682
Even this light rising is because of that. Because your attention is still outside, you see.

00:55.695 --> 00:58.773
So you go on, the flickering of the eyes starts.

00:58.795 --> 01:01.652
Then I tell you to fix up your eyes onto my finger.

01:01.661 --> 01:04.572
When you fix it up onto my finger and my face,

01:04.593 --> 01:09.006
what happens the chaitanya pushes you, through your eyes, into the centre, you see.

01:09.013 --> 01:11.162
So that you see me as I am.

01:11.191 --> 01:14.974
But the eyes are controlled by the chaitanya

01:14.986 --> 01:19.563
and the attention that is inside is pushed inside that,

01:19.635 --> 01:24.920
what you call the apparition, in the Agnya chakra

01:24.930 --> 01:27.712
So I always say that if you are flickering your eyes,

01:27.709 --> 01:31.358
please pay attention to me, so that the chaitanya works out through your eyes

01:31.370 --> 01:33.858
and fixes your attention to pass through.

01:33.878 --> 01:39.162
Because the light starts spreading on all the sides and you see that light and the eyes go on like that;

01:39.212 --> 01:41.441
you cannot close your eyes.

01:41.432 --> 01:43.361
Which is, that is the reason for that.

01:43.371 --> 01:46.215
Then the second thing you said that

01:46.287 --> 01:48.465
you are facing:

01:48.527 --> 01:51.537
your Sahasrara was on the thing.

01:51.587 --> 01:53.953
Yes, one of the reasons for nirvichara is that.

01:53.938 --> 01:59.117
But also nirvichara is a way to express the blessings of your Mother.

01:59.132 --> 02:02.429
When She wants to bless you. See, you wrote the letter She was happy.

02:02.459 --> 02:05.143
Just to bless you, you became nirvichar.

02:05.152 --> 02:06.697
You see, it’s a blessing.

02:06.697 --> 02:11.181
That’s how you get the grace, you see, that comes to you from your Mother,

02:11.270 --> 02:14.562
that you become nirvichar, that's that one has to recognise.

02:14.639 --> 02:16.393
If you do the things that I tell you,

02:16.401 --> 02:18.419
I feel I bless you very much,

02:18.453 --> 02:20.010
because they are for your good,

02:20.020 --> 02:20.911
for your kalyana

02:20.919 --> 02:22.431
for your mangal (auspiciousness)

02:22.430 --> 02:26.518
and that’s why you are blessed and that blessing you feel as nirvichara.

02:26.526 --> 02:29.941
Because I am Nirvichara myself.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.611
Yes. Come along.

02:33.591 --> 02:36.830
I’m Douglas Fry, one of the early Sahaja yogis from London.

02:36.911 --> 02:39.275
And what I would like to say is,

02:39.335 --> 02:43.865
it’s rather amazing the way that the forces of good

02:43.925 --> 02:46.014
and the forces of bad

02:46.074 --> 02:50.361
have nevertheless, pushed us towards Mataji.

02:50.348 --> 02:54.145
Now the person that introduced us to Mataji,

02:54.156 --> 02:56.615
as you have heard from Gavin,

02:56.604 --> 02:59.455
was a yoga ‘playboy’. Now....

02:59.466 --> 03:00.617
And who was that?

03:00.625 --> 03:01.958
A yoga playboy.

03:03.487 --> 03:04.693
A guru or something.

03:04.764 --> 03:07.955
Yes, he was, he was no doubt, and is still!

03:08.775 --> 03:13.491
The reason he came to England…

03:13.502 --> 03:15.513
…was to make some money out of yoga!

03:15.592 --> 03:21.573
The reason he came to England was because he’d seen this particular fake guru

03:21.591 --> 03:24.693
with the long hair, that looked like a pop star.

03:28.491 --> 03:32.252
He told me, and I think he might have told some of the others of us,

03:32.264 --> 03:37.633
that this particular guru had said to him,

03:37.685 --> 03:40.175
“You should go to England.”

03:40.245 --> 03:45.580
So, obviously he came to England and started yoga classes.

03:45.603 --> 03:49.508
Now, where the yoga classes started

03:49.501 --> 03:55.621
was the last place that you could teach yoga because it was very, very cold

03:55.699 --> 03:58.896
and we started in winter,

03:58.896 --> 04:00.295
and there was no heating on.

04:00.347 --> 04:06.387
But for some reason, the yoga classes still went on.

04:06.395 --> 04:09.230
Now, eventually,

04:09.292 --> 04:13.353
he met Mataji and tried his experiment on us.

04:13.401 --> 04:22.305
And we all felt coolness in the hands, we all got Realisation.

04:22.415 --> 04:29.110
Now, another thing that this yoga playboy had tried

04:29.100 --> 04:32.358
was Transcendental Meditation, I found out.

04:32.360 --> 04:36.505
Now, after us having got Realisation,

04:36.507 --> 04:39.435
he tried to teach us meditation

04:39.456 --> 04:42.257
and the technique that he was trying to do

04:42.326 --> 04:46.737
was a technique used by TM.

04:46.786 --> 04:51.317
The TM people, they give you a mantra, they might make the mantra up themselves.

04:51.377 --> 04:55.698
Or sometimes they give you names that sounds a bit like Sanskrit.

04:55.638 --> 05:00.555
In fact, I heard one fellow who had a mantra that sounded like “key ring”.

05:03.451 --> 05:04.211
"Keyring!"

05:06.355 --> 05:10.630
If you pronounce it strangely it can sort of sound like...

05:10.658 --> 05:13.238
If you pronounce it strangely, it can sound a bit like Indian

05:13.264 --> 05:15.940
but that’s neither here nor there.

05:15.951 --> 05:18.872
So this fellow was trying to teach us

05:18.932 --> 05:22.192
he was trying to use Transcendental Meditation techniques

05:22.211 --> 05:24.411
to make us go into meditation.

05:24.480 --> 05:27.906
And he told us that we should concentrate on a word,

05:27.966 --> 05:30.146
a word that we think is nice.

05:30.146 --> 05:34.680
Now the particular word I used was ‘divine’.

05:34.687 --> 05:37.850
Now we sat down there

05:37.870 --> 05:40.545
for about ten... we sat down

05:40.571 --> 05:43.685
for about ten or fifteen minutes to meditate

05:43.701 --> 05:49.721
and I remember I had my head... I felt an explosion,

05:49.771 --> 05:52.363
that finished in my head.

05:52.360 --> 05:54.940
Now I did not know the time that it was

05:55.000 --> 05:58.512
so I said, “I felt this explosion in my head, what was it?”

05:58.509 --> 06:02.579
So he said, “Oh, I don’t think that was anything, you forget about it!”

06:05.187 --> 06:09.725
Now,

06:09.754 --> 06:19.024
once again, I think perhaps, just for a split of a second, I had achieved thoughtless awareness

06:19.084 --> 06:21.855
and my Kundalini obviously had risen.

06:21.884 --> 06:25.194
And then, at a later date,

06:25.225 --> 06:30.132
once I was asleep, I actually saw my Kundalini rise.

06:30.156 --> 06:34.964
So my head was full of an intense white flame

06:34.987 --> 06:37.028
and then it went down again

06:37.038 --> 06:39.437
and then it came up again.

06:39.447 --> 06:43.968
And then I heard a “ting” from the top of my head.

06:43.987 --> 06:47.877
That is a ting.  That’s not Kundalini, you see, this is the thing

06:47.891 --> 06:50.591
This I assumed to be the breaking of the brahmarandhra

06:50.600 --> 06:51.682
No, no.

06:51.682 --> 06:52.372
This wasn't.

06:52.372 --> 06:53.362
It is not.

06:53.341 --> 06:56.024
This is what happens to so many people, you see,

06:56.031 --> 06:58.904
that is always the ida and pingala nadi.

06:58.901 --> 07:00.414
This is?

07:00.430 --> 07:01.754
This is ida pingala

07:01.774 --> 07:02.923
Oh, I see, pardon me.

07:02.934 --> 07:04.044
The sympathetic.

07:04.050 --> 07:07.021
That works out and it looks like Kundalini.

07:07.011 --> 07:10.053
But you don’t get any vibrations in the hand or head. It looks like.....

07:10.031 --> 07:13.927
You know, some people get a big hole here, down below.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.653
Especially this Muktananda he does like that.

07:16.713 --> 07:19.163
And they get a feeling like that you know.

07:19.244 --> 07:23.803
You should never feel the Kundalini rising like an explosion in a block like that.

07:23.874 --> 07:24.963
Oh, I see

07:24.908 --> 07:28.019
Later on, after Realisation, you may feel the slow movement.

07:28.069 --> 07:30.790
But normally in Realisation you do not

07:32.865 --> 07:36.704
Well, anyway, that’s all I want to say.

07:36.735 --> 07:39.875
Thank you very much.

07:39.894 --> 07:41.914
What about Sahaj Yog?

07:43.154 --> 07:46.411
Well, anyway, after all this experience

07:46.482 --> 07:56.593
initially of course I was in quite a mess, I used to take drugs and drink as many of the Western people seem to do these days.

07:56.601 --> 07:58.759
And gradually I found,

07:58.762 --> 08:02.809
after being exposed to Mataji’s love and Mataji’s influence,

08:02.822 --> 08:07.019
I found that gradually my interest in drugs,

08:07.033 --> 08:10.249
my interest in drinking and smoking, it all dropped out

08:10.273 --> 08:14.608
and I gradually became more and more stable.

08:14.639 --> 08:25.988
And now, I find that life for me is very settled and…

08:26.007 --> 08:27.598
you can give Realisation.

08:27.658 --> 08:32.015
I find that I can give Realisation to people and it's...

08:32.015 --> 08:33.395
I can cure also.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.566
And yes, also I have to say I can cure people

08:35.638 --> 08:42.347
and I find it... the first time I gave Realisation to somebody, I was quite amazed

08:42.437 --> 08:46.417
and just to realise I could do such a thing.

08:46.437 --> 08:50.096
But now, to give Realisation it’s still, you know,

08:50.105 --> 08:54.525
it still makes me feel very nice and clean inside,

08:54.567 --> 08:58.403
and it’s just, just wonderful.

09:05.869 --> 09:08.768
This kind of experience many people get,

09:08.783 --> 09:13.233
like Shri Krishna also had like that and so many people get a feeling like that,

09:13.323 --> 09:15.766
that something goes up, suddenly shoots off,

09:15.826 --> 09:18.766
and you feel exploded and opened out and all that.

09:18.816 --> 09:20.516
But that is not the Kundalini.

09:20.566 --> 09:23.083
It is the sympathetic nervous system

09:23.133 --> 09:25.953
which is very much in strain.

09:25.963 --> 09:27.790
You see her strain.

09:27.793 --> 09:31.460
And in that expression of that strain, what happens

09:31.463 --> 09:35.932
that the whole thing, the energy of the complete sympathetic,

09:35.992 --> 09:40.171
whatever they have in the parasympathetic is sucked in,

09:40.181 --> 09:41.721
into the sympathetic.

09:41.711 --> 09:44.391
Because the sympathetic is too much activated, you see.

09:44.421 --> 09:47.841
Then what happens the parasympathetic system has

09:47.841 --> 09:49.761
your stored up energy, whatever it is.

09:49.781 --> 09:52.890
So it just sucks in all that

09:52.910 --> 09:54.649
and when it is sucked in,

09:54.660 --> 10:02.449
suddenly, the wave from the pelvic plexus, down below starts.

10:02.470 --> 10:08.859
Because, you see, all the energies are released to the sympathetic.

10:08.919 --> 10:11.430
Because the sympathetic is so exhausted

10:11.480 --> 10:16.588
that whatever is the energy left in the chakras is released.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.338
Once it is released, you see,

10:18.343 --> 10:21.327
all that released energy you see, makes you feel

10:21.317 --> 10:24.817
that the energy is rising within you because it is rising through ida and pingala.

10:24.867 --> 10:29.716
Now this is the energy which is just sucked into ida and pingala. It rises up.

10:29.722 --> 10:32.622
And you can feel it going up and coming down and all that.

10:32.672 --> 10:37.327
But the after effects of this one is this,

10:37.332 --> 10:45.875
that such a person – of course in these experiences people feel sometimes a horrible thing also,

10:45.935 --> 10:48.965
that they feel that there’s a heat liberation,

10:49.015 --> 10:53.845
sometimes they feel some sort of a scorpion bites going on

10:53.875 --> 10:57.072
or some snakes coming up and all kind of things can happen in this.

10:57.085 --> 10:59.004
It can be very horrifying also, this one,

10:59.018 --> 11:01.768
and could be very simple also.

11:01.794 --> 11:06.558
But when this happens, the after effect is like that, that you become arbitrary.

11:07.484 --> 11:13.117
It is sort of all this drugs system started after that,

11:13.105 --> 11:17.455
because once you are released from that self-control in between,

11:17.525 --> 11:20.285
you can take to anything like this,

11:20.355 --> 11:23.486
because you are free now to do whatever you please you see.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.766
And that’s how you can take to drugs and things.

11:25.786 --> 11:29.726
And this is what all these gurus are doing,

11:29.740 --> 11:33.382
is to take out this stored energy which is controlling you,

11:33.452 --> 11:35.312
suck them out onto the sympathetic.

11:35.402 --> 11:37.442
There are so many ways by which they can do it:

11:37.442 --> 11:39.042
they can starve you,

11:39.092 --> 11:41.322
they can make you work very hard,

11:41.372 --> 11:42.935
they can make you tired,

11:43.005 --> 11:49.469
they can make you say some mantras, things. I mean they make your sympathetic work so hard

11:49.469 --> 11:52.040
that ultimately a stage is reached where

11:52.060 --> 11:55.539
your chakras release all the energy that is stored in them

11:55.536 --> 11:57.529
and just get out of it, you see.

11:57.569 --> 12:02.489
So all this energy they will suck in and a person feels: “Oh, suddenly something has happened!”

12:02.479 --> 12:07.485
But in these circumstances, you see, you may have a big hollow in the head like that,

12:07.535 --> 12:11.055
as if, like a mad person has, here, a big hollow.

12:11.115 --> 12:15.055
And the whole thing is sucked in and you get a hollow there like that.

12:15.059 --> 12:16.507
So many people get this thing,

12:16.557 --> 12:21.682
that is a very different thing. But because all the energy that was inside is sucked in.

12:21.697 --> 12:25.502
So it has become like a big hollow inside, you see.

12:25.513 --> 12:28.342
Like a mad person has too, the same thing.

12:28.363 --> 12:35.557
So this is the way people confuse between Kundalini awakening and the exhaustion of the sympathetic.

12:35.523 --> 12:40.237
Normally the Kundalini awakening through Sahaj Yoga, you do not feel anything.

12:40.246 --> 12:42.486
It just goes up and works out.

12:42.536 --> 12:45.286
But sometimes, if there is, after Realisation,

12:45.356 --> 12:49.573
if there is an obstruction due to certain combinations,

12:49.569 --> 12:52.139
it may be the obstruction may go out like that.

12:52.189 --> 12:54.721
But there’s a tremendous difference between the two.

12:54.719 --> 12:59.531
That first, you release in the hands, of the vibrations, start with that.

12:59.539 --> 13:03.071
But with the first one you do not get, on the contrary, you get heated up

13:03.141 --> 13:06.351
and you start avoiding yourself, escaping from yourself.

13:06.361 --> 13:09.711
And this starts. And that’s how you get into these drugs

13:09.729 --> 13:14.789
This is very much played by the gurus. You see, that’s what they do to you.

13:14.869 --> 13:20.375
They exhaust you completely, so that you cannot withstand reality and the present moment.

13:20.406 --> 13:22.575
And so you try to get into something.

13:22.586 --> 13:25.993
And once you try to escape it, you see, you just...

13:25.993 --> 13:30.469
the whole release of the stores and parasympathetic takes place

13:30.486 --> 13:32.063
and the Deities are broken

13:32.083 --> 13:33.833
and you are broken, you become arbitrary.

13:33.883 --> 13:36.113
It’s a cancerous sort of a thing.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.816
So that’s not Kundalini awakening but we would say,

13:38.829 --> 13:43.256
it is more a sympathetic system which comes into play

13:43.279 --> 13:48.624
and the movement of peristaltic, what you call that ‘pumping’ up.

13:48.644 --> 13:52.803
Peristaltic movements of the pumping up of the energy starts.

13:52.804 --> 13:55.314
They start putting it into the thing.

13:55.374 --> 13:59.623
And the whole thing is sucked in because of the exhaustion.

13:59.630 --> 14:01.680
So one should not confuse between the two.

14:01.750 --> 14:05.544
Because after Realisation you cannot take to drugs and things easily.

14:05.550 --> 14:07.043
It’s very difficult..

14:08.403 --> 14:11.343
You have to really force yourself to take to drugs.

14:13.334 --> 14:18.638
Mother, you just answered now something that I never questioned because after I met you I did not want to question it.

14:18.698 --> 14:27.448
I had, two years before meeting you, I had an extremely powerful experience of the same kind…
