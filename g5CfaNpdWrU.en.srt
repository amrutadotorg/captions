1
00:03:23,609 --> 00:03:34,321
In Sahaja Yoga the Guru puja has a very
different significance

2
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:39,297
from any other guru puja.

3
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:47,868
When you worship your Guru

4
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:56,078
you are also worshipping the Guru within
you.

5
00:04:00,247 --> 00:04:10,595
This is not in any other guru-disciple
system

6
00:04:10,796 --> 00:04:22,097
because, in you, the Guru, the Master has
been awakened.

7
00:04:22,298 --> 00:04:27,786
And so, when you are worshipping your Guru,

8
00:04:27,986 --> 00:04:34,332
then this Master within you is also
worshipped, you respect it,

9
00:04:34,533 --> 00:04:41,207
you glorify it, you awaken it, and you
manifest it.

10
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:51,337
This we have to realise that – in Sahaja
Yoga – if you are a Sahaja Yogi.

11
00:04:52,052 --> 00:05:02,858
Now, the quality of Guru, first and
foremost, is that he makes you meet God:

12
00:05:03,493 --> 00:05:07,511
means he raises the Kundalini

13
00:05:07,712 --> 00:05:16,467
and establish the relation between
the All-pervading Power.

14
00:05:17,165 --> 00:05:19,701
And as your Guru is Adi Shakti,

15
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:24,553
you make that person meet, also,
the Adi Shakti.

16
00:05:24,754 --> 00:05:30,116
So you have a double advantage that,
at the same time,

17
00:05:30,317 --> 00:05:33,468
when you give them Realisation,

18
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:40,611
not only that you make them feel the union
with the Divine Power,

19
00:05:40,812 --> 00:05:44,914
but you can make them meet the Divinity
Itself,

20
00:05:45,114 --> 00:05:48,584
the source of Divine Power.

21
00:05:48,785 --> 00:05:54,023
So your responsibility, as Sahaja Yogis,
is very great

22
00:05:54,224 --> 00:05:58,047
because in you is there is the Guru.

23
00:05:58,248 --> 00:06:06,097
Now in our mantras we say that, “Mother,
I am my own Guru.”

24
00:06:06,298 --> 00:06:13,722
But, saying that, do we realise that:
if I am my own Guru,

25
00:06:13,923 --> 00:06:21,645
this “I” and “my Guru,” between the two,
what have I achieved?

26
00:06:21,846 --> 00:06:26,907
Where am I? Can I guide myself?

27
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:31,405
Have I got the light of the Spirit on my
attention so well established

28
00:06:31,606 --> 00:06:39,490
and manifested that I can guide myself and
guide others later on?

29
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:44,886
First of all, in the Guru principle it is
important

30
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:49,991
that you see to yourself –
the introspection:

31
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:57,240
Can I be my own Guru? Have I become
my own Guru?

32
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:06,885
Now, in your case, your Guru is a Mother,
a woman,

33
00:07:07,086 --> 00:07:18,815
so, it has to be among women that
the development of their Guru qualities

34
00:07:19,016 --> 00:07:26,332
have to be very well manifested. But it’s
just the way it is not.

35
00:07:26,533 --> 00:07:29,938
For them, they are still the mothers or
they are the wives

36
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:39,776
or they are Sahaja Yoginis. But they don’t
realise that you are also the Gurus.

37
00:07:39,977 --> 00:07:43,743
And, because your Mother is a Guru,
because She is a woman;

38
00:07:43,944 --> 00:07:48,992
and you have to be also of that quality,
that people should say,

39
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:51,853
“Look at this woman, she’s such a Guru.”

40
00:07:52,054 --> 00:07:55,951
But still, as I hear from the different
leaders

41
00:07:56,151 --> 00:08:00,417
that the ladies are absolutely still very
much far away

42
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:06,415
and are very few who can be called as real
Sahaja Yoginis.

43
00:08:06,616 --> 00:08:10,038
It’s a sad thing to hear.

44
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:18,233
Because if you still keep to all these
mundane things of womanhood

45
00:08:18,434 --> 00:08:23,604
and the drawbacks of womanhood, which has
come out of domination maybe,

46
00:08:23,805 --> 00:08:28,458
because of always they were shown to be
something lower.

47
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:35,647
Specially in the Christian religion they
were never regarded as something holy.

48
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:39,494
They have this kind of a diffidence in them

49
00:08:39,695 --> 00:08:42,965
that they don’t understand that dharma

50
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:47,272
can be established more by women than
by men.

51
00:08:47,473 --> 00:08:51,500
And the Guru’s work is to establish
the dharma –

52
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:57,635
in the society, in the family, in
relationships.

53
00:08:57,836 --> 00:09:03,355
All these Gurus, which are representing
all these great symbols here,

54
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:06,998
have done nothing but have established
dharma.

55
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,710
But, first of all, before establishing
the dharma,

56
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,845
we should watch ourselves – have we got
dharma within ourselves or not?

57
00:09:18,702 --> 00:09:24,551
First of all, the quality of a person who
has dharma

58
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:32,814
is that he listens to others, he obeys.

59
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,031
And this is something [that] has gone wrong
with the Western women, I think,

60
00:09:38,232 --> 00:09:43,704
that they have forgotten how to listen to
others, how to obey others.

61
00:09:43,905 --> 00:09:47,941
That’s why their children also don’t obey
them.

62
00:09:50,314 --> 00:09:55,287
Obedience, if you do not have, nobody’s
going to obey you.

63
00:09:55,488 --> 00:09:58,807
First, you must learn to obey.

64
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:07,805
A person like Kabira, because he was born
of a unknown cast,

65
00:10:08,029 --> 00:10:12,306
people didn’t know what he was born from,

66
00:10:12,507 --> 00:10:19,494
and he could not go directly to any Guru.

67
00:10:19,695 --> 00:10:26,794
So, he heard about Ramanand, a great Guru
of those days,

68
00:10:26,995 --> 00:10:31,795
who used to go to the river Ganges every
morning to have his bath.

69
00:10:31,996 --> 00:10:37,660
So one day on his steps Kabira kept lying,

70
00:10:37,869 --> 00:10:43,974
and in the darkness the Guru could not see,
and he touched him with his feet.

71
00:10:44,175 --> 00:10:48,404
He said, “Who are you?” So he said,
“I’m Kabir,

72
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:54,041
and I’m your disciple.” And he caught hold
of his feet.

73
00:10:54,242 --> 00:10:57,776
And when he caught hold of his feet, he
[Ramanand] said, “Alright, come along!”.

74
00:10:57,977 --> 00:11:04,959
And then he became such a great saint
in India.

75
00:11:05,173 --> 00:11:09,175
People know him more than they know his
Guru; he became so great.

76
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:11,726
The basic thing is humility.

77
00:11:11,927 --> 00:11:15,396
Yesterday you saw how the musician
(Nishat Khan) was humble.

78
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:18,764
All the time he was humble.

79
00:11:18,965 --> 00:11:22,293
He didn’t know how to express his humility
every time.

80
00:11:22,494 --> 00:11:25,391
All the time he was humble.

81
00:11:25,592 --> 00:11:31,095
Because in humility only you can receive
the blessings,

82
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:37,999
you can receive the quality that is of your
Guru.

83
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:42,309
Now, for a Guru as you have seen

84
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:49,032
that, in My own way, in My own image,
you have to come up.

85
00:11:49,233 --> 00:11:52,917
First of all your life should be absolutely
transparent.

86
00:11:53,118 --> 00:11:56,213
Transparency is the essence of Sahaja Yoga.

87
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:59,428
Everybody should know what you are doing,
where you are going,

88
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:06,637
what is the way you live, what is the way
you are behaving.

89
00:12:06,838 --> 00:12:12,658
I have seen people, who are gurus, also
in the sense that we call them leaders,

90
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:15,773
or we can call them sub-gurus, or they
cannot be called as priest,

91
00:12:15,973 --> 00:12:19,621
but I can say ‘communication centres’
as they are.

92
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:27,445
In them you find that they are very fussy
type of people.

93
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:31,427
Always think about their body, always think
about their comfort,

94
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:35,200
always grudge about – nobody looked after
them –

95
00:12:35,401 --> 00:12:39,770
as if they suffer from persecution-mania!

96
00:12:40,237 --> 00:12:43,924
Or they will grudge about food, “I didn’t
eat my food for one day!”

97
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,822
Doesn’t matter!

98
00:12:46,023 --> 00:12:50,687
For a Guru it’s better to starve for about
three, four days nicely,

99
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:55,656
so that you get over this idea of hunger.

100
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:59,617
You’ll be surprised since I’m here I have
not eaten anything much,

101
00:12:59,818 --> 00:13:04,571
and just drinking something, because just
the Guru has no hunger.

102
00:13:04,772 --> 00:13:09,426
Because it is in your stomach the Guru,
vibrations, are so much

103
00:13:09,627 --> 00:13:12,442
that you don’t feel like eating anything.

104
00:13:12,643 --> 00:13:16,092
So then, what do you eat and how do you
eat and all these things

105
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:18,703
that we have given up to come to Sahaja
Yoga.

106
00:13:18,904 --> 00:13:21,990
So even if leaders have this nonsense
in their head

107
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,770
[like] what do you get to eat! I mean, this
is the basics, absolutely!

108
00:13:27,971 --> 00:13:31,250
And when I hear some people telling Me, oh,
what did they eat

109
00:13:31,450 --> 00:13:38,607
and how did they eat and all! It’s like I
feel they are like tourists in Sahaja Yoga.

110
00:13:38,808 --> 00:13:41,627
Just come in Sahaja Yoga like tourists,

111
00:13:41,828 --> 00:13:44,083
you see, to see places and go round

112
00:13:44,284 --> 00:13:50,701
and to know where you get, in what
restaurant, you get good food and cheaply.

113
00:13:52,288 --> 00:13:55,862
All this is so basically,

114
00:13:56,063 --> 00:14:02,339
absolutely not a manifestation of Guru
principle.

115
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:06,891
Now you have seen your Guru as She is.

116
00:14:07,092 --> 00:14:13,096
I do not know what I eat, what they give
Me, what I want.

117
00:14:13,297 --> 00:14:16,599
They go on giving Me whatever they think
I like,

118
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,970
and I just don’t know if I like that thing
or not, or what is it.

119
00:14:21,171 --> 00:14:23,517
If they ask Me, “Mother, what will You
have?” I said, “What will I have,

120
00:14:23,718 --> 00:14:26,833
I don’t know really, what will I have?
Anything!”

121
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,177
So there has to be no choices.

122
00:14:29,378 --> 00:14:33,316
First of all not to waste your attention
on choices.

123
00:14:33,517 --> 00:14:36,353
Of course, only on vibrations.

124
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:38,959
I mean, supposing, you go to a restaurant,

125
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,643
find all kinds of funny vibrations there,

126
00:14:42,844 --> 00:14:45,949
people are getting drunk or anything, then
of course you should say.

127
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:51,155
But all the choices must be based on
vibrations and not on material things.

128
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,389
That you get something nice there,
“Let’s go there,”

129
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:59,620
and they’ll travel for fifty miles to go
eat something nonsensical.

130
00:14:59,821 --> 00:15:03,253
It should be all nonsense for all Sahaja
Yogis.

131
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:07,051
And when I said “Sahaja Yogi” it means
also Sahaja Yoginis.

132
00:15:07,252 --> 00:15:11,022
So the food part of it is aswadha.

133
00:15:11,223 --> 00:15:14,899
You should not have any taste for any
special food.

134
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,793
Specially in France to say that people
may not like,

135
00:15:17,994 --> 00:15:26,643
but French are very, very conscientious or
aware about the food part.

136
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,876
I don’t know how far they make really
good food,

137
00:15:30,077 --> 00:15:33,960
but at least they think they eat very good
food. Alright.

138
00:15:34,161 --> 00:15:41,349
So, the eating of good food is a kind
of an addiction.

139
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:44,376
It’s a kind of an addiction; it’s something
like drug –

140
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:46,814
that you must have good food.

141
00:15:47,015 --> 00:15:52,956
So Zen started this system of what they
call the tea ceremony.

142
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:58,449
In the tea ceremony what they did, I mean,
I have been through that

143
00:15:58,650 --> 00:16:03,012
and it’s really quite a test of people.

144
00:16:03,213 --> 00:16:07,740
With Me it was alright, but the rest
of them got really frightened.

145
00:16:07,941 --> 00:16:10,786
That in the tea ceremony whatever rituals
they do

146
00:16:10,987 --> 00:16:14,986
they give you a tea, which is so bitter,

147
00:16:15,187 --> 00:16:17,664
and we can say [like] quinine raised
to power 108!

148
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:20,414
It’s like that. And they give you very
nicely,

149
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:25,761
handle you with such ritual that you have
to take it.

150
00:16:25,962 --> 00:16:31,013
So first they say, “You see the cup without
thinking.”

151
00:16:31,214 --> 00:16:34,723
So he tried to make thoughtless awareness
through the cup.

152
00:16:34,924 --> 00:16:37,766
I don’t know how much one can achieve
with that.

153
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:46,754
But that tea if you take once, your tongue
is good for anything.

154
00:16:48,929 --> 00:16:53,706
And to compensate it they give you
something sweet,

155
00:16:53,907 --> 00:16:56,598
which is again sweetness raised to power
108,

156
00:16:56,799 --> 00:17:01,536
so sweet that it becomes bitter! So sweet.

157
00:17:01,739 --> 00:17:05,838
So this is just to conquer the tongue
[that] Zen must have thought

158
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:11,522
that better give them this tea ceremony

159
00:17:11,723 --> 00:17:14,586
where there is no tea, there’s nothing

160
00:17:14,787 --> 00:17:19,718
but just you really give such shocks
to your tongue,

161
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,912
so that after that you can eat whatever
you get.

162
00:17:24,113 --> 00:17:30,443
And that’s why you must know that Japanese
can eat anything.

163
00:17:30,644 --> 00:17:34,804
They have solved their food problem
because they can eat anything!

164
00:17:35,005 --> 00:17:43,969
They can just fish out some crabs or could
be some prawns,

165
00:17:44,170 --> 00:17:47,945
just peel them out like peanuts and eat
them like that.

166
00:17:48,146 --> 00:17:50,138
I think Zen has solved this problem
for them,

167
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:54,390
because they have food shortage and this is
how they can eat everything:

168
00:17:54,591 --> 00:17:57,253
they can eat the bark of the tree, they can
eat the snake,

169
00:17:57,454 --> 00:18:01,284
they can eat the lizards, they can eat
the frogs, everything they can eat.

170
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:07,215
So all their eating problems are solved
in that country by Zen, I think,

171
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:12,686
because you have no taste.

172
00:18:13,345 --> 00:18:18,319
But in this I think the worst are,
in the whole world are Indians.

173
00:18:18,536 --> 00:18:23,641
They are the fussiest people for food.
Because their women have spoiled them.

174
00:18:23,842 --> 00:18:25,675
They know very good cooking and they know

175
00:18:25,876 --> 00:18:28,527
how to handle their husbands by cooking
very well.

176
00:18:28,728 --> 00:18:31,049
And the way they cook food for them,
you see,

177
00:18:31,249 --> 00:18:33,541
the men have to go back to Indian food.

178
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,999
Even if they travel the whole world,
they’ll need Indian food,

179
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,173
they can’t get over their tongues.

180
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:42,912
It is such a big conditioning in India
of food

181
00:18:43,113 --> 00:18:45,356
that I just don’t know how will they get
out,

182
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:49,892
the, absolutely, the basics which are
important.

183
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:53,047
Gandhiji tried that very much in
the ashram.

184
00:18:53,248 --> 00:19:00,620
He used to give horrid food, boiled food
with the oil of mustard on top

185
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:03,805
and then nobody could eat that. Raw!

186
00:19:04,006 --> 00:19:06,426
And he used to make everybody eat that.

187
00:19:06,627 --> 00:19:12,424
Not only that, he would make them clean
the bathrooms, WC’s, everything

188
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:16,191
so that you get rid of your nose also, that
you need everything.

189
00:19:16,392 --> 00:19:18,991
Because so many people you will, while
eating also in India

190
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,229
will put something to their noses, and they
smell everything.

191
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:26,058
So they are oversensitive to their tongue
and to their nose.

192
00:19:26,259 --> 00:19:28,839
But not to their eyes, to eyes they are
not.

193
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:34,927
For eyes I would say the most sensitive
people are Japanese and Chinese

194
00:19:35,128 --> 00:19:37,775
and also the Western people are very much
sensitive

195
00:19:37,975 --> 00:19:41,487
because they don’t like to see anything
dirty, filthy or ugly.

196
00:19:41,688 --> 00:19:43,952
Indians won’t mind any dirt, filth,
anything,

197
00:19:44,153 --> 00:19:51,461
just like dogs and what you call, horses
or buffalos!

198
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:54,907
They can walk through any dirt, filth –
anything!

199
00:19:55,108 --> 00:19:58,638
Nothing matters to them, anything ugly,
any ugly building

200
00:19:58,839 --> 00:20:02,274
or an ugly dress or anything is alright
for them.

201
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:05,485
It doesn’t matter, to their eyes it doesn’t
matter at all.

202
00:20:05,686 --> 00:20:09,664
Only thing [is that] kitchen should be clean
and they are all the time in the kitchen.

203
00:20:09,865 --> 00:20:12,452
So we don’t have to learn all these bad
things from Indians.

204
00:20:12,653 --> 00:20:15,577
There are some good things they have, but
there are certain things

205
00:20:15,778 --> 00:20:17,297
[which] are very bad conditionings.

206
00:20:17,498 --> 00:20:20,549
And the next to that are, I think,
the French.

207
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,614
But if you eat English food you can become
quite good

208
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:27,963
because there’s no taste in English food.

209
00:20:39,198 --> 00:20:44,691
So, I have no problem anywhere because
I think I have no taste at all

210
00:20:44,892 --> 00:20:47,663
and I can eat anything any way it is
cooked, it’s alright,

211
00:20:47,864 --> 00:20:51,939
I don’t bother about what is cooked, what
is not cooked.

212
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:56,447
But if you have some French people for
a dinner in a restaurant

213
00:20:56,648 --> 00:20:59,390
they will spend forty-five minutes deciding
what they are going to eat,

214
00:20:59,590 --> 00:21:01,365
and what a waste of energy!

215
00:21:01,566 --> 00:21:04,325
Forty-five minutes just to decide what they
are going to eat!

216
00:21:04,526 --> 00:21:07,654
After all what is so great, what you are
going to eat? It’s all there.

217
00:21:07,855 --> 00:21:10,172
Just one thing that everybody should have.

218
00:21:10,373 --> 00:21:14,575
So for Sahaja Yogis it’s important to give
up this idea, “I will have this.”

219
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:20,453
First of all nobody should ask, “What will
you have?”

220
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:26,132
To Me also. I do not like people asking Me
questions [like], “What will You have?”

221
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:31,254
Because I’ve to think about it and I want
to be in Nirvichara.

222
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:54,978
So, this is a, one, big ordeal, which we do
not understand:

223
00:21:55,179 --> 00:22:00,257
how much we are attached to food. And food
goes in the stomach.

224
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:03,132
And not only that it spoils our guru
system,

225
00:22:03,332 --> 00:22:06,097
but also spoils our physical system.

226
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:09,728
So we should try not to look at food.

227
00:22:09,929 --> 00:22:13,423
That’s why fasting was told to the all
the people

228
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:19,562
who wanted to develop their Gurupada,
so that they should not fast.

229
00:22:19,763 --> 00:22:27,213
But they do not fast normally because
they think of food, so there’s no fasting.

230
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:31,730
I mean, fasting means that you go into
Nirvichara and don’t think of food.

231
00:22:31,931 --> 00:22:35,640
But they are all the time thinking of food,
so it has no meaning

232
00:22:35,841 --> 00:22:40,230
and you are just the same whether you eat it
or not, your mind is eating it all the time.

233
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:42,938
Then you start thinking, “When will I end
my fast

234
00:22:43,139 --> 00:22:47,372
and know where will I go to have what?”

235
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:52,047
So this is a very basic thing that we
should get rid

236
00:22:52,248 --> 00:22:55,053
of our habits, of our conditionings –

237
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:58,398
what we are going to have and what food
we are going to have.

238
00:22:58,599 --> 00:23:05,115
Our children also should be given a proper
training about it that –

239
00:23:05,316 --> 00:23:09,385
it’s alright, sometimes there is no salt,
sometimes there’s no sugar, doesn’t matter.

240
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:11,659
And sometimes there’s nothing, doesn’t
matter.

241
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,390
Nothing [is] important for a Sahaja Yogi,

242
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:19,064
you can live without food for days
together, no problem.

243
00:23:21,238 --> 00:23:27,841
So for a Sahaja Yogi there’s nothing like
taste of food and hunger.

244
00:23:28,042 --> 00:23:34,603
There’s only one hunger is to be purified,
to be clean.

245
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:39,474
This is one of the things that dirties
our mind, we should say,

246
00:23:39,675 --> 00:23:44,170
that we think about food all the time.

247
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:50,159
Even in Russia I found people carried
all Indian things there,

248
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:54,346
they were cooking all Indian things, and
I am, poor thing, I can’t eat anything.

249
00:23:54,547 --> 00:23:57,068
So they cooked, brought everything for Me,
thinking I’m an Indian,

250
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:02,760
but they don’t know I am Zen – I cannot,
I do not, have sense of taste.

251
00:24:02,961 --> 00:24:07,051
So once, to get over taste one has to work
out.

252
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:10,007
It’s an experiment we have to do with
ourselves.

253
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:16,225
Unless and until we introspect ourselves
and do experiments we cannot rise.

254
00:24:16,426 --> 00:24:18,944
Because though the Kundalini is trying
her level best,

255
00:24:19,144 --> 00:24:21,001
but your conditionings are so great

256
00:24:21,202 --> 00:24:27,214
that it cannot pierce through and cannot
make you onto that Guru level.

257
00:24:27,415 --> 00:24:31,172
If you see the lives of all these Gurus:
they were married,

258
00:24:31,373 --> 00:24:34,443
they had children, they lived a normal life

259
00:24:34,644 --> 00:24:41,086
but in their own personal life they were
absolutely detached people.

260
00:24:41,287 --> 00:24:46,663
So, first detachment should come from food.

261
00:24:46,864 --> 00:24:51,373
And there whatever you like you just
don’t eat.

262
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,946
That’s the best way. Because already
because of liking something…

263
00:24:54,146 --> 00:24:56,405
supposing if somebody’s fond of ice-cream.

264
00:24:56,606 --> 00:25:00,979
He must have already spoiled his liver;
so then, give [it] up now.

265
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:04,484
If you like pasta, give up pasta.

266
00:25:04,685 --> 00:25:06,638
If you like something else, just give up,

267
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,736
don’t ask for it and don’t eat it at all;

268
00:25:09,937 --> 00:25:14,829
so that, you see, your mind will get little
bit detached from it.

269
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:20,247
It’s very easy to achieve this detachment,
I think,

270
00:25:20,448 --> 00:25:26,745
if you work it out in a sensible way. Just
try to punish your body.

271
00:25:26,946 --> 00:25:29,354
You see, if you are your Guru, you better
take hold

272
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:32,085
of first of all your body and your
conditionings.

273
00:25:32,286 --> 00:25:35,144
You have to treat your body with this
thing.

274
00:25:35,345 --> 00:25:38,004
I am told many girls who have married
abroad

275
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:40,229
are still making their Indian food and
eating that.

276
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,951
It’s horrible it is! They should starve.

277
00:25:43,152 --> 00:25:46,905
If they starve for say about five, six days
or maybe eight days,

278
00:25:47,106 --> 00:25:50,532
then they’ll eat any food in any case.

279
00:25:50,733 --> 00:25:52,385
That’s why the fasting is given.

280
00:25:52,586 --> 00:25:57,580
So one should adjust oneself to any kind
of food you can have.

281
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:01,037
And if you want to survive then you eat
anything,

282
00:26:01,238 --> 00:26:03,603
so just make it a point that you get rid

283
00:26:03,804 --> 00:26:07,686
of this very simple conditioning you have –

284
00:26:07,887 --> 00:26:13,023
of liking the food that you want to eat and
you don’t want to have anything else.

285
00:26:13,224 --> 00:26:18,053
I think as Sahaja Yogini or Sahaja Yogi who
cannot get rid of this little thing,

286
00:26:18,254 --> 00:26:21,916
then how can you call him a Sahaja Yogi?
I don’t know. He’s very asahaj.

287
00:26:22,117 --> 00:26:24,926
Because the other day I met one lady.

288
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:26,754
I said, “What is the matter, where have
you been?”

289
00:26:26,955 --> 00:26:30,717
She said, “I have been looking out for some
sort of an Indian ingredient.”

290
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:34,771
I said, “How can you get it here in this
Spain? You cannot.” “Why?”

291
00:26:34,972 --> 00:26:37,622
“Because they asked me to make Indian
food.” “Alright.

292
00:26:37,823 --> 00:26:39,457
Then without that can’t you make Indian
food?

293
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:41,818
What is the need to run all the way, whole
day

294
00:26:42,019 --> 00:26:44,009
for a one small little thing called hing
(asafoetida)?”.

295
00:26:44,210 --> 00:26:46,799
There’s a big name for that, it’s a small
little thing.

296
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,010
Just to get that she had to run all over
the places to get it!

297
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:55,729
So for people who are Sahaja Yogis if they
are sahaj,

298
00:26:55,930 --> 00:27:03,085
whatever is available you can make
something nice out of it and eat it.

299
00:27:03,286 --> 00:27:06,820
So that shows what? It shows sagacity,

300
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:11,516
shows trupti (contentment), shows your
satisfaction.

301
00:27:11,717 --> 00:27:14,844
And that is one of the manifestations
of a Guru

302
00:27:15,045 --> 00:27:17,894
that he’s a satisfied soul.

303
00:27:18,095 --> 00:27:21,852
He’s just self-contained, he doesn’t
bother.

304
00:27:22,053 --> 00:27:25,963
Now, for example, some people, specially
in the West,

305
00:27:26,163 --> 00:27:28,620
thank God, they are not spoiled by their
wives so much.

306
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:31,561
They don’t have so much of conditioning,
they can eat anything.

307
00:27:31,762 --> 00:27:34,811
I’ve seen that when they come on the India
tour,

308
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:37,685
all the Indians say, “Horrid food was given

309
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:42,009
and the poor things were eating that horrid
food and this and that.”

310
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,242
And I asked them, “Which place you like
the best?”

311
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:47,667
They said, “Brahmapuri.” I said, “Eh? They
were saying

312
00:27:47,868 --> 00:27:50,604
Brahmapuri had the worst food and everybody
is complaining.”

313
00:27:50,805 --> 00:27:52,465
“No, no. Brahmapuri was the best,

314
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:55,649
because we could bathe in the river and we
could sing

315
00:27:55,850 --> 00:27:59,476
and we could enjoy it!” You see, that’s
the sign of one thing,

316
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:05,605
to get rid of your bad habits of food
business.

317
00:28:05,899 --> 00:28:11,697
Now the second part is for the body you
need comforts.

318
00:28:11,898 --> 00:28:15,193
I must congratulate the Western Sahaja
Yogis

319
00:28:15,393 --> 00:28:19,914
that they may be coming from any walk
of life –

320
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:23,137
I must say, the Indians have to learn
from them –

321
00:28:23,337 --> 00:28:27,000
they may be coming from any position
or status.

322
00:28:27,201 --> 00:28:34,221
All of them enjoy the comfort of the Spirit
when they travel in the Tour.

323
00:28:34,422 --> 00:28:37,742
They do not ask for, “I haven’t got
a chair,

324
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:42,087
I haven’t got a bed, I haven’t got a proper
things here.”

325
00:28:42,288 --> 00:28:45,217
In this way, you see, you will realise

326
00:28:45,418 --> 00:28:50,581
that the body comfort is of no importance.

327
00:28:50,782 --> 00:28:53,925
It’s, we have just spoilt our body, there’s
no need, no need.

328
00:28:54,126 --> 00:28:56,730
Body you put it anywhere, will sleep
in any case.

329
00:28:56,931 --> 00:28:59,534
If you cannot sleep for two nights,

330
00:28:59,735 --> 00:29:02,110
alright, put on some music for one night
or two nights

331
00:29:02,311 --> 00:29:06,409
as we had here, you will sleep anyway!

332
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:26,974
So this is the second point is that we have
to give up body comfort.

333
00:29:27,175 --> 00:29:31,575
But the third point where I think
the Western people falter

334
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:36,643
is their materialistic attitude.
Materialistic attitude

335
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:44,198
and their fondness of their eyes. So one
of them is the worst of all.

336
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,629
I mean, the worst in worst of all is that
you can never have,

337
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:50,667
that’s such a big blot if you have that,

338
00:29:50,868 --> 00:29:54,573
is to have a roving eye and things like
that.

339
00:29:54,774 --> 00:29:58,573
It’s out of question. That’s out of
question for women or for men.

340
00:29:58,774 --> 00:30:01,592
They are not Sahaja Yogis by any chance.

341
00:30:01,793 --> 00:30:06,772
They have to have very clean eyes.

342
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:09,059
That part is alright.

343
00:30:09,260 --> 00:30:13,349
And the second part is the greed, lust
and greed.

344
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:17,990
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga maybe the lust
part is over,

345
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:24,830
but greed is still there with so many who
get lost.

346
00:30:25,031 --> 00:30:28,652
So I would say Indians do not have this
lust problem,

347
00:30:28,853 --> 00:30:33,959
but they still have greed, greed problem –
means they want to buy something

348
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,794
like a radio or some electrical stuff they
must buy.

349
00:30:39,995 --> 00:30:42,034
If they come abroad they must buy
something.

350
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:45,521
It’s alright, if you get it, well and good,
if they don’t get it, well and good.

351
00:30:45,722 --> 00:30:48,599
It should be [that attitude]. But for
a Westerner, you see,

352
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:54,228
he would not like to give up his furniture,
which his great grandmother had it.

353
00:30:54,429 --> 00:30:56,796
Though he can’t sit on it because it’s so
old.

354
00:30:56,997 --> 00:31:00,399
If he sits on it, it will break. But he
must keep it to show off that,

355
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,130
“I had a great grandmother who gave this
unique chair.”

356
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:08,983
According to Indian standards it’s junk!
Absolute junk.

357
00:31:09,184 --> 00:31:11,871
Because it is good for nothing you put it
in the drawing room,

358
00:31:12,072 --> 00:31:15,030
nobody can sit on it and it looks junky.

359
00:31:15,231 --> 00:31:18,350
But according to the Western mind the older
it is, the better –

360
00:31:18,551 --> 00:31:21,929
whether it is a junk or anything – he’ll
have so many junks in the house

361
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,253
and then they will sell like hot cakes.

362
00:31:24,454 --> 00:31:27,541
Because there’s a very subtle materialistic
attitude

363
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:31,063
towards matter that, “This will sell like
hot cakes if I sell it”,

364
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:36,249
because there must be another mad Westerner
who would like to buy that junk. You see?

365
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:40,454
So this junk that you have in the house
it’s better to get rid of,

366
00:31:40,655 --> 00:31:43,838
because God knows how many people must
have used [it].

367
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,922
It’s like a grave in the house. It’s
a grave.

368
00:31:47,123 --> 00:31:50,470
So to have then also the antique jewellery.

369
00:31:50,671 --> 00:31:57,643
Antique jewellery is another mad, antique
is a – what you can say –

370
00:31:57,844 --> 00:32:02,446
is the fad or addiction of the Western
people – antique.

371
00:32:02,647 --> 00:32:06,887
For us nothing is antique because we still
produce antique things, beautiful things

372
00:32:07,088 --> 00:32:09,229
so Indians don’t understand the value
of antiques.

373
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:12,603
They don’t understand how these people
are so mad

374
00:32:12,804 --> 00:32:17,684
after torn things and broken things and
dirty things and filthy things!

375
00:32:17,885 --> 00:32:21,053
But the Western mind has been brought up
that way.

376
00:32:21,254 --> 00:32:23,140
Now, in these antique things I have seen
that,

377
00:32:23,341 --> 00:32:25,612
once I went to somebody’s house, you see,

378
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:29,155
and he asked Me with very great honour
to sit on his chair.

379
00:32:29,356 --> 00:32:31,996
And as soon as I sat on the chair I thought
there were snakes

380
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:34,916
and there were scorpions all biting Me.

381
00:32:35,117 --> 00:32:37,462
I got a fright, I got up. I said, “What
is it?”

382
00:32:37,663 --> 00:32:40,331
He said, “This is from great, great,
great grandmother, you see,

383
00:32:40,532 --> 00:32:46,065
she gave us this thing.” I said, “It will
break, I’d better sit outside.”

384
00:32:46,852 --> 00:32:50,228
So this also madness of this antique
is so much

385
00:32:50,429 --> 00:32:55,836
that it is unbelievable how people go
into it.

386
00:32:56,037 --> 00:33:01,016
So there’s a joke in India there’s a very
great writer

387
00:33:01,217 --> 00:33:04,846
called as Premchand, he wrote about two
Englishmen

388
00:33:05,047 --> 00:33:12,058
going on the road of Benares when they were
hit by a lota (metal pot),

389
00:33:12,259 --> 00:33:19,069
that they use for their bathrooms, fell
on their feet. And it fell on their feet.

390
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:24,715
And jokingly he says, “on the feet where
all the bureaucrats fall.”

391
00:33:24,916 --> 00:33:28,072
Means, all Indian bureaucrats used to fall
at the feet of the English at that time!

392
00:33:28,273 --> 00:33:30,623
So he made a joke. But doesn’t matter.

393
00:33:30,824 --> 00:33:32,611
Then the English, you see, looked at that
thing

394
00:33:32,811 --> 00:33:35,026
and they were very angry and immediately
they took to law,

395
00:33:35,227 --> 00:33:38,586
“You have to come to the courts, you have
to come to the police

396
00:33:38,787 --> 00:33:43,259
and we’re going to report this has fallen
there, it has hit us,” and all that.

397
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:47,895
So there was a clever man, he knew
the English or the Western mind,

398
00:33:48,096 --> 00:33:53,972
he said, “Sir, do you know this, this lota
has very valuable!” He said, “Why?”

399
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:59,305
“Because this one was used by Akbar
the Great. So ancient it is”.

400
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:04,060
He said, “Really?” “Yes it is and, you
know, you just don’t quarrel with them.

401
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:08,665
And ask them for this lota.” And he told
in Indian language to them that,

402
00:34:08,866 --> 00:34:13,808
“I have befooled these people, I have told
them that this lota belonged to Akbar

403
00:34:14,009 --> 00:34:23,635
and you have to take this lota and use this
lota to just to befool them.”

404
00:34:23,836 --> 00:34:26,729
So then they asked, “But alright, we’ll
forgive you,

405
00:34:26,930 --> 00:34:31,936
we’ll not take you to any courts or
anything, but you just give us this lota.”

406
00:34:32,137 --> 00:34:34,233
They said, “No, we can’t.” He said, “Why?”

407
00:34:34,434 --> 00:34:35,964
“Because it’s such an antique piece,
you see.”

408
00:34:36,165 --> 00:34:38,875
In India you won’t find anybody respecting
antique pieces,

409
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:41,867
especially in Benares nobody bothers.

410
00:34:42,068 --> 00:34:45,228
So they said, “Really?”, “Yes, it belonged
to Akbar

411
00:34:45,428 --> 00:34:48,986
and, you know, my father was, my
forefathers worked with him,

412
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:51,837
so he gave us this lota, we can’t give you,
we are sorry, you see.”

413
00:34:52,038 --> 00:34:55,629
“No, no, no, no, please give us, you see,
and we’ll no take you to the police.”

414
00:34:55,830 --> 00:34:58,482
“Alright, you charge us, whatever money
you charge us,” and all that.

415
00:34:58,683 --> 00:35:01,202
In those days they paid one thousand
rupees, you see,

416
00:35:01,403 --> 00:35:03,630
this is equal to, now, one crore
(10 million), I think.

417
00:35:03,831 --> 00:35:07,260
They gave, these English paid them and
bought that lota,

418
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:11,733
which had nothing to do with Akbar or
anyone.

419
00:35:11,934 --> 00:35:15,563
So this madness of antique has to go away
from our minds.

420
00:35:15,764 --> 00:35:21,967
It’s such a built-in thing within us, that
we always talk of antiquities.

421
00:35:22,168 --> 00:35:25,081
Perhaps maybe because of wars everything
was destroyed

422
00:35:25,282 --> 00:35:28,996
and whatever was in the olden times was
something very beautiful and good

423
00:35:29,197 --> 00:35:32,818
and now we are not making very good
things, perhaps, maybe that is the reason.

424
00:35:33,019 --> 00:35:35,838
But now we are making nice things, we can
make.

425
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:39,163
Now in England I was surprised the old
crafts are coming up,

426
00:35:39,364 --> 00:35:41,915
everywhere I go the old crafts are coming
up.

427
00:35:42,116 --> 00:35:48,893
So to respect antiques means you just
stop making the old craft revive.

428
00:35:49,094 --> 00:35:51,037
Because you pay so much to the antiques,

429
00:35:51,237 --> 00:35:55,750
the same thing made today won’t fetch
the same price as it was.

430
00:35:55,951 --> 00:35:59,443
Now this has ruined our creativity,

431
00:35:59,644 --> 00:36:05,557
ruined our handwork and it has ruined our
whole – I think the quality of our life,

432
00:36:05,757 --> 00:36:09,626
because the way we are mad after antiques.

433
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:15,891
So this also should go from your head that
anything antique is something good.

434
00:36:16,092 --> 00:36:19,988
It’s a very superficial value – if you see
to it.

435
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:23,287
Because people think that antique is
something expensive.

436
00:36:23,488 --> 00:36:27,134
It’s just a marketing style that people
have felt

437
00:36:27,335 --> 00:36:30,529
that this is expensive, that is expensive,
so it’s something great

438
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:37,927
to wear something stupid and to say that,
“this is antique jewellery,” and go about.

439
00:36:38,128 --> 00:36:41,434
I mean, God knows how many people must
have used it and must have worn it

440
00:36:41,635 --> 00:36:44,602
and what must be the feelings of that
person.

441
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:49,906
So we have to understand that this
conditioning that we have in our heads,

442
00:36:50,107 --> 00:36:59,444
that we must have something antiques with
us, keep something of such value.

443
00:36:59,645 --> 00:37:03,385
I mean, these questions never arose before,
so it’s not written in any books.

444
00:37:03,586 --> 00:37:08,360
Anyone of the books of the Gurus is not
written that, “Don’t care for antiques.”

445
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:12,340
They have written, “Don’t drink, don’t
smoke,”

446
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,461
all other things which spoils your Nabhi.

447
00:37:15,662 --> 00:37:17,909
They’ve written all these things. But they
have not written

448
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,928
that, “Don’t worry about antiques so much.”

449
00:37:21,129 --> 00:37:23,822
You see, and I find that’s a craze nowadays

450
00:37:24,023 --> 00:37:28,230
and so we have to tell people that we have
to be careful.

451
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:31,593
Moreover I feel the way people have gone
to drugs and that,

452
00:37:31,794 --> 00:37:33,687
maybe that because they used so much
antiques

453
00:37:33,887 --> 00:37:36,770
that the bhoots from the antiques must
have caught them.

454
00:37:36,971 --> 00:37:39,712
Can’t understand that why people are
so melancholy,

455
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:42,075
all the time crying, weeping, and all that.

456
00:37:42,276 --> 00:37:46,886
So the conditionings of these matter as
we think it to be

457
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:49,935
is to be absolutely taken out.

458
00:37:50,136 --> 00:37:52,989
Of course, I mean in certain countries
we should say

459
00:37:53,190 --> 00:37:56,052
that the antique things [that] were made
were good and nice.

460
00:37:56,253 --> 00:37:59,517
But, only because something is antique it
should not be respected,

461
00:37:59,718 --> 00:38:06,031
[but] because of its intrinsic value
of aesthetics, it’s alright.

462
00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:11,013
But one has to see first of all
the vibrations of everything.

463
00:38:11,214 --> 00:38:15,081
If the vibrations are good then you should
accept, otherwise not,

464
00:38:15,282 --> 00:38:19,045
because we have the language of vibrations

465
00:38:19,246 --> 00:38:24,082
and we have to use the language
of vibrations.

466
00:38:24,283 --> 00:38:28,301
Once you start using the language
of vibrations you’ll be surprised

467
00:38:28,502 --> 00:38:35,018
how you will get the complete picture
as to what is to be done.

468
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:45,978
So to get rid of these three conditionings
too, for our body is very important.

469
00:38:46,179 --> 00:38:52,450
And the worst thing for a Sahaja Yogi [is]
to think that he’s sick:

470
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:57,436
is a, sort of a, tarnishing the name
of Sahaja Yoga.

471
00:38:57,637 --> 00:39:02,753
If you still feel you are sick you better
get out of Sahaja Yoga!

472
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:10,108
Because either you get well or you are not
a Sahaja Yogi, one of the two things.

473
00:39:10,309 --> 00:39:13,167
If you are a Sahaja Yogi you have to see
that you get well

474
00:39:13,368 --> 00:39:16,295
and if there are certain problems also –
doesn’t matter.

475
00:39:16,496 --> 00:39:19,772
Now, for example, supposing, I have certain
problems,

476
00:39:19,973 --> 00:39:22,586
which I know, because of Sahaja Yoga,

477
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:27,876
because of My position as the Mother,
position as Adi Shakti:

478
00:39:28,107 --> 00:39:30,550
certain physical things I have to face,

479
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:33,366
parasympathetic working I have to face,

480
00:39:33,567 --> 00:39:36,167
but I go through it! Is accepted.

481
00:39:36,368 --> 00:39:40,868
You have to accept your body as it is
and you are not to sort of say that,

482
00:39:41,068 --> 00:39:43,784
“I’m not well,” and “There’s something
rong with me,”

483
00:39:43,985 --> 00:39:47,687
and go on complaining like some old hag!

484
00:39:47,888 --> 00:39:50,460
Never think you are old, first of all.

485
00:39:50,661 --> 00:39:55,473
Never think that you have gone old or you
are no good.

486
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:58,086
Look at your Mother. I never think that
way.

487
00:39:58,287 --> 00:40:02,046
Yesterday half of you were sleeping, still
I was alert

488
00:40:02,247 --> 00:40:05,363
and listening to the music and today I’m
again alert here.

489
00:40:05,564 --> 00:40:09,924
So if you have a Guru then that image
should be with you that:

490
00:40:10,125 --> 00:40:14,381
“Look at our Mother. She’s so old, how much
She travels, how much She does!”

491
00:40:14,582 --> 00:40:16,504
Alright, you might say, She’s the Adi
Shakti!

492
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:19,093
But little bit of shakti you too have.

493
00:40:19,294 --> 00:40:25,830
And that shakti is to be shown by your
full dynamism.

494
00:40:26,031 --> 00:40:29,513
If you have no dynamism and if you still
feel very weak

495
00:40:29,714 --> 00:40:31,646
that means you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

496
00:40:31,847 --> 00:40:37,581
So just ask for, ask for any amount of
energy – it can come to you.

497
00:40:37,782 --> 00:40:39,446
That dynamism, it should be there.

498
00:40:39,647 --> 00:40:43,015
Now this I would say, for the physical
self that one has to know

499
00:40:43,216 --> 00:40:46,376
that you are all younger and getting
younger and younger,

500
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:52,811
but not the stupidity of youth, but
gravity, the gravity of the age.

501
00:40:53,012 --> 00:40:57,653
Actually I have seen children who are
born realised,

502
00:40:57,854 --> 00:41:03,790
they are very grave, they won’t do anything
that is not dignified.

503
00:41:03,991 --> 00:41:09,012
And they will never, I’ve never heard them
talking to some of –

504
00:41:09,213 --> 00:41:10,781
the Sahaja Yoginis have a bad habit
of talking,

505
00:41:10,982 --> 00:41:12,490
“tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk, tuk,” among
themselves.

506
00:41:12,691 --> 00:41:18,061
It’s a very bad habit. Which shows that
they [are] still very much lacking.

507
00:41:18,262 --> 00:41:21,810
Just wearing saris or wearing bindis you do
not become a Sahaja Yogini.

508
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:23,574
First of all, what is the gravity?

509
00:41:23,774 --> 00:41:26,490
You should only speak whenever it is
necessary.

510
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:31,496
So I have seen these Sahaja Yogis who are
born realised children

511
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,655
they stand like this before Me.

512
00:41:33,856 --> 00:41:38,074
And they say very few words, but beautiful
words they speak.

513
00:41:38,275 --> 00:41:42,142
And say things, which you can remember
all the time.

514
00:41:42,343 --> 00:41:45,335
They just do not go on wasting anything.

515
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,591
And they are extremely obedient.

516
00:41:47,792 --> 00:41:51,087
So from them one can learn that these are
born realised

517
00:41:51,288 --> 00:41:56,559
and the way their Guru principle is acting,
are we also acting the same way?

518
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,756
Or we are doing something that is not good
for our ascent?

519
00:42:00,957 --> 00:42:04,414
So even after coming to Sahaja Yoga if you
do not try hard

520
00:42:04,615 --> 00:42:07,318
to introspect yourself, you have missed
the point

521
00:42:07,519 --> 00:42:10,140
that you compare yourself with your Guru –
all the time.

522
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:14,881
Now. Then everything has to be understood

523
00:42:15,081 --> 00:42:18,323
in the right perspective that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

524
00:42:18,524 --> 00:42:20,685
Now for a Sahaja Yogi first and foremost
thing

525
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:27,236
[is] that he has to have love. First. For
others, not for himself.

526
00:42:27,437 --> 00:42:29,775
If you are all the time worried about
yourself,

527
00:42:29,976 --> 00:42:33,158
“My body is such, my this thing such, and
I have to do this and that,”

528
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:37,683
then you don’t love others. But do you see
to the comfort of others?

529
00:42:37,884 --> 00:42:40,791
Do you feel the compassion of other
Sahaja Yogis?

530
00:42:40,992 --> 00:42:44,240
Do you feel, “What have I to bring for
them? What is missing in them?”

531
00:42:44,441 --> 00:42:50,397
Do you work it out? Do you go out of
the way to help them?

532
00:42:50,667 --> 00:42:56,490
First of all Sahaja Yogis. Now Sahaja
Yogis are different things.

533
00:42:56,691 --> 00:43:01,264
I have seen many Sahaja Yogis will go and
take the side of the non-Sahaja Yogis

534
00:43:01,465 --> 00:43:05,244
and try to debase the Sahaja Yogis.
Is a very wrong thing.

535
00:43:05,445 --> 00:43:08,131
You belong to this new race

536
00:43:08,332 --> 00:43:12,648
and the people who do not belong to this
new race and if they are attacking anybody:

537
00:43:12,849 --> 00:43:16,965
these are your hands, your feet, your head,
and if they attack it,

538
00:43:17,166 --> 00:43:21,929
it is duty bound that you help them instead
of helping the others.

539
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:24,619
Maybe something wrong with this person,
doesn’t matter.

540
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:27,610
You need not show all the fair play there.

541
00:43:27,811 --> 00:43:31,265
In that place you should support a Sahaja
Yogi out and out.

542
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:34,382
Later on you may correct and you may
tell that person,

543
00:43:34,583 --> 00:43:37,660
“You should not have done like this,
it was wrong.”

544
00:43:37,861 --> 00:43:42,603
So this dignity and this understanding
comes only through silence.

545
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:47,330
But if you are chirping all the time,
talking “tuktuk, tuktuk, tuktuk, tuktuk,”

546
00:43:47,531 --> 00:43:51,730
it can never, never can make you a deeper
person.

547
00:43:51,931 --> 00:43:54,584
You’ll be just flying in the air with
all that.

548
00:43:54,785 --> 00:43:57,475
So for women now is best is to take
to mauna,

549
00:43:57,676 --> 00:44:00,669
is to keep quiet, just keep quiet.

550
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:02,916
They all the time want to talk.

551
00:44:03,117 --> 00:44:07,470
This I’ve heard from all the leaders that
it’s a big problem with women.

552
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:10,799
They just go on talking stories, telling
stories.

553
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:17,371
But if you ask them to come and speak,
they will start shaking.

554
00:44:17,764 --> 00:44:23,217
How many can give speeches? Women?

555
00:44:23,418 --> 00:44:30,901
If you understand that if you cannot give
a speech, you better not talk also.

556
00:44:31,362 --> 00:44:35,381
You should be able to give a speech because
your Mother is a woman, She gives speeches.

557
00:44:35,582 --> 00:44:37,725
Why can’t you give some speech? You cannot.

558
00:44:37,926 --> 00:44:40,640
If I make you stand here, you’ll be
shaking, I know that.

559
00:44:40,841 --> 00:44:44,342
But if it comes to murmuring souls, you
are there.

560
00:44:44,543 --> 00:44:47,226
So that is one thing women have to be very
careful [about].

561
00:44:47,427 --> 00:44:50,119
And as today is the Guru puja I have
to tell you things,

562
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:53,248
not as a Mother but as your Guru.

563
00:44:53,449 --> 00:44:58,030
That, if you have to ascend the best thing
is for you to stop talking.

564
00:44:58,231 --> 00:45:02,171
“Maunam sarvartha sadhanam.” ‘Maun’ means
to keep quiet.

565
00:45:02,372 --> 00:45:08,662
It gives you all kinds of facilities, just
keep quiet.

566
00:45:08,863 --> 00:45:11,998
If somebody’s talking too much, just keep
quiet.

567
00:45:12,199 --> 00:45:14,763
If somebody’s trying to criticise, keep
quiet.

568
00:45:14,964 --> 00:45:16,796
That’s your silence, that’s your right,

569
00:45:16,996 --> 00:45:20,403
that’s your domain that you can keep
silent.

570
00:45:20,604 --> 00:45:22,511
Just watch that person.

571
00:45:22,712 --> 00:45:27,228
If it comes then to answer, then you can
answer better.

572
00:45:27,429 --> 00:45:31,962
But if somebody’s trying to attack, you
just keep silent.

573
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:34,483
But this silence has to be established

574
00:45:34,684 --> 00:45:38,581
and one should only establish by not
talking too much.

575
00:45:38,782 --> 00:45:43,252
I have seen also when I am sitting here, I
have seen women talking among themselves,

576
00:45:43,453 --> 00:45:46,979
and this is very wrong. You must learn
the silence.

577
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:50,825
Like yesterday I saw so many ladies also
were walking out, walking in.

578
00:45:51,026 --> 00:45:54,384
In the church will you do that? You won’t
do it.

579
00:45:54,585 --> 00:45:58,365
In the church there is no Christ, there’s
a horrible priest sitting there

580
00:45:58,566 --> 00:46:02,933
but you cannot do it. You all keep quiet,
you sit there nicely.

581
00:46:03,134 --> 00:46:05,866
I’ve never seen anybody walking out here
and there

582
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:09,482
and doing all kinds of things, putting
the children in front like that,

583
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:14,519
making them sleep. Never! Can you do that
in the church?

584
00:46:16,229 --> 00:46:20,619
What a discipline people observe in that
church, which is an artificial place.

585
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:25,603
And where you are now, that kind of
a silence has to be there

586
00:46:25,804 --> 00:46:29,389
and that kind of understanding, that depth,
that awe has to be there.

587
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:32,075
But because we have not yet developed
that Guru thing.

588
00:46:32,276 --> 00:46:34,927
If you have developed it then immediately
it will work out.

589
00:46:35,128 --> 00:46:39,377
You will see your gravity will show in your
behaviour.

590
00:46:39,578 --> 00:46:52,631
So this is for our attention not to be
wasted.

591
00:46:52,832 --> 00:46:56,799
To discuss somebody, to discuss about
others’ characters, we have no business.

592
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,739
Do we discuss the character of one hand
to another hand?

593
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:04,483
To discuss about what has happened about
marriages, things like that.

594
00:47:04,684 --> 00:47:09,456
Also marriage is just… in Sahaja Yoga it’s
not such an important thing.

595
00:47:09,657 --> 00:47:11,899
Some people pay too much attention
to marriage, you see,

596
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:15,366
and marriage becomes a headache. Also
then, “What about my marriage?”

597
00:47:15,567 --> 00:47:18,435
Then again ten minutes you see that person,
“What about my marriage?”

598
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,484
Again after ten minutes, “What about
my marriage?”

599
00:47:20,685 --> 00:47:23,481
You want to run away. I mean, you see,

600
00:47:23,682 --> 00:47:27,412
it’s something becomes like a mania for
people, “What should we do?”

601
00:47:27,628 --> 00:47:30,784
And the whole thing is, all depends, and
the whole programming

602
00:47:30,984 --> 00:47:33,513
depends on how you are going to get
married.

603
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:39,005
So you have come to Sahaja Yoga, you
are sanyasis.

604
00:47:40,997 --> 00:47:43,841
You are not married people in a way.

605
00:47:44,042 --> 00:47:45,924
You are married only to Sahaja Yoga,

606
00:47:46,125 --> 00:47:48,481
that’s your husband, that’s your wife.

607
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:52,479
And the so-called husband and wife are
there.

608
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:57,197
But if they are not Sahaja Yogis then you
are unmarried, definitely.

609
00:47:57,398 --> 00:48:00,543
So too much attention is paid in Sahaja
Yoga to marriages.

610
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:06,883
I have seen that before, marriage, before
Sahaja Yoga,

611
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:10,652
marriage was a joke; every third day there
was a divorce

612
00:48:10,853 --> 00:48:15,278
and people would run away and do all kinds
of things.

613
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:19,420
Then when they got married after Sahaja
Yoga

614
00:48:19,621 --> 00:48:22,946
they are the greatest romantic people ever
known in the whole world!

615
00:48:23,147 --> 00:48:26,505
I mean, all ‘Romeo, Juliets’ going about.
I just don’t understand.

616
00:48:26,706 --> 00:48:28,893
Even in the Indian villages people complain
that,

617
00:48:29,094 --> 00:48:32,120
“What sort of these people are? I mean,
they have no sense at all

618
00:48:32,321 --> 00:48:34,998
and the way they go round, are they
the saints?”

619
00:48:35,199 --> 00:48:42,251
So that saintliness, that sanyasta, that
asceticism

620
00:48:42,451 --> 00:48:44,930
has to be expressed in our married life.

621
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:48,307
I don’t mean that you don’t have
relationship with your husband

622
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:53,105
but in a very private way. It’s has to be
extremely private

623
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:57,936
and it should not be such a great thing
to go into romanticism.

624
00:48:58,137 --> 00:49:02,304
You’ll ruin the whole of Sahaja Yoga in the
West if you start doing that nonsense!

625
00:49:02,505 --> 00:49:08,550
Because also there’s an idea about it that,
you see, you fall in love.

626
00:49:08,751 --> 00:49:11,234
But then you’ll fall! That’s the first
point is.

627
00:49:11,435 --> 00:49:13,214
You will fall [but] you want to rise.

628
00:49:13,415 --> 00:49:18,167
So this attachment and this worry about
the husband and this and that,

629
00:49:18,368 --> 00:49:21,573
I mean, you can carry on with any kind of a
husband and wife if you are a Sahaja Yogi,

630
00:49:21,774 --> 00:49:25,835
should be able to. I mean, I know that’s
very simple.

631
00:49:26,036 --> 00:49:29,151
It’s a… your husband is a study, wife is
a study, that’s all.

632
00:49:29,352 --> 00:49:31,621
You study a person, what sort of a person
he is.

633
00:49:31,822 --> 00:49:34,056
But for that you have to have the witness
state

634
00:49:34,257 --> 00:49:36,198
and you have to see, you have to be
detached.

635
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:40,193
So in marriages one has to be detached.

636
00:49:40,394 --> 00:49:43,842
But, on the contrary, I find that just
after the marriage

637
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:46,822
they want to organise some special thing
for them

638
00:49:47,023 --> 00:49:52,603
to go to some sort of a honeymoon or some
sort of a thing!

639
00:49:52,804 --> 00:49:54,761
I don’t know how these ideas crawl up.

640
00:49:54,962 --> 00:49:57,729
These are coming from the old conditionings
of things

641
00:49:57,930 --> 00:49:59,549
and after honeymoon they come and say,

642
00:49:59,750 --> 00:50:01,951
“Mother, this marriage is not going
to work out.”

643
00:50:02,152 --> 00:50:05,940
So it’s better to do slow and steady and
then decide.

644
00:50:06,141 --> 00:50:09,342
Because you just jump into honeymoon mood
and come back and say,

645
00:50:09,543 --> 00:50:13,655
“Mother, this, I have started thinking and
I don’t think.”

646
00:50:13,856 --> 00:50:18,120
I know of a lady who was jumping with
a Indian gentleman

647
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:21,876
and she was on her way to Australia. In
Singapore, she telephones that,

648
00:50:22,077 --> 00:50:24,666
“Mother, I don’t think this marriage will
work out.”

649
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:26,947
And here everybody complained to Me,
“Mother,

650
00:50:27,148 --> 00:50:32,584
these two are behaving in such a manner
that Indians are rather embarrassed.”

651
00:50:32,785 --> 00:50:36,306
So the sense of shame you must learn
from Indians.

652
00:50:36,507 --> 00:50:40,328
They’d never… husband and wife never sit
together in India

653
00:50:40,529 --> 00:50:43,583
is regarded as bad manners and it should
be with you also.

654
00:50:43,784 --> 00:50:48,384
That, even in the puja, even in anything
they are sitting in the public.

655
00:50:48,591 --> 00:50:52,743
What is the need to show your relationship
in the public?

656
00:50:52,944 --> 00:50:55,937
It’s only in the private. This is one
of the things one,

657
00:50:56,138 --> 00:51:00,308
if you start understanding, there will be
a proper adjustment.

658
00:51:00,509 --> 00:51:03,493
Men should be with men in the public,

659
00:51:03,694 --> 00:51:07,638
women should be with the women together.

660
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:10,645
But the women or men, whatever they are

661
00:51:10,846 --> 00:51:17,261
whatever are their bad, bad points should
not be brought back.

662
00:51:17,462 --> 00:51:24,762
Like, I would say the men have jealousies
and they have power orientation

663
00:51:24,963 --> 00:51:29,991
and they discuss about leadership and they,
every, they get a shock

664
00:51:30,192 --> 00:51:32,212
if you tell them that you are not going
to be a leader,

665
00:51:32,412 --> 00:51:35,583
as if they think leadership is something
very concrete.

666
00:51:35,784 --> 00:51:39,641
It’s the greatest myth ever going, is this
leadership!

667
00:51:39,842 --> 00:51:44,845
There’s nothing like leaders in this Sahaja
Yoga, it’s just a joke.

668
00:51:45,046 --> 00:51:48,318
And your Mother is very good at playing
serious jokes.

669
00:51:48,519 --> 00:51:53,252
So be careful! Don’t be childish about it.

670
00:51:53,453 --> 00:51:56,208
You have to understand that this is a big
joke going on

671
00:51:56,409 --> 00:52:01,560
and it’s just a testing point and if I test
you wrong,

672
00:52:01,761 --> 00:52:03,892
you can tell Me, but I think this has
worked well,

673
00:52:04,093 --> 00:52:06,686
because I can test people very well on that
level

674
00:52:06,886 --> 00:52:11,255
and immediately I know when the person
gets onto the horse of ego.

675
00:52:11,456 --> 00:52:16,403
So, for your mental attitude, has to be
different

676
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:19,946
and our priorities have to change.

677
00:52:20,147 --> 00:52:23,195
Our priorities have to change. What are
our priorities?

678
00:52:23,396 --> 00:52:28,613
First and foremost thing is our ascent, is
the first priority.

679
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:31,276
For our ascent whatever is needed has to be
done.

680
00:52:31,477 --> 00:52:33,509
If you have to punish your body, alright.

681
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:36,020
If you have to punish yourself, alright.

682
00:52:36,221 --> 00:52:42,930
If you have a conditioning, get rid of it.
Just introspect yourself,

683
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:45,975
that is Self-realisation, is to know your
Self.

684
00:52:46,176 --> 00:52:47,572
When you know your Self and know

685
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:52,781
what is clinging onto it, just to remove it
completely.

686
00:52:52,982 --> 00:52:55,874
Work it out the way you like. Work it out
the way you like.

687
00:52:56,075 --> 00:53:06,491
You see, it is very important that
the body, mind,

688
00:53:07,356 --> 00:53:11,342
everything should be your slaves.

689
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:16,401
Nothing should dominate you. You should be
on top of everything.

690
00:53:16,602 --> 00:53:19,383
How dare your body ask for anything?

691
00:53:19,584 --> 00:53:22,426
How dare your mind tells you anything?

692
00:53:22,627 --> 00:53:24,769
How this conditioning works on you?

693
00:53:24,970 --> 00:53:27,487
“I am a Sahaja Yogi, I’m above everything.”

694
00:53:27,688 --> 00:53:32,976
Like the lotuses have come out of the
ponds, you have come out of it.

695
00:53:33,177 --> 00:53:39,212
We have so many proofs to show that you
are realised souls.

696
00:53:39,413 --> 00:53:43,336
I’ll show you some photographs that I have
to show that there is light.

697
00:53:43,537 --> 00:53:46,562
I can put light into you, they are all
enlightened people.

698
00:53:46,763 --> 00:53:48,899
But in My presence if you become the light,

699
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:50,797
you must carry the light outside.

700
00:53:50,998 --> 00:53:53,967
Not only in My presence, but when you go
out.

701
00:53:54,168 --> 00:53:58,630
But one of the reasons, I think, when I
tell something people just start thinking

702
00:53:58,831 --> 00:54:03,277
about whom Mother is talking, they never
think, “She is talking about me.

703
00:54:03,478 --> 00:54:06,285
That’s the only way you can penetrate
within yourself

704
00:54:06,486 --> 00:54:08,745
when you see that, “Mother is talking
about me,

705
00:54:08,946 --> 00:54:11,836
She’s correcting me all alone and She’s
telling me.”

706
00:54:12,037 --> 00:54:15,941
Then only it will penetrate and it will
work out.

707
00:54:16,142 --> 00:54:19,886
The priorities have to be changed and
the first and foremost

708
00:54:20,087 --> 00:54:23,926
is your ascent and the Spirit and Sahaja
Yoga.

709
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:28,831
The rest is negligible, nothing important.

710
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:38,715
Then the faith that there is this
All-pervading Power,

711
00:54:38,916 --> 00:54:42,755
which is looking after us, is very
important.

712
00:54:42,956 --> 00:54:44,727
This time the musicians came all the way.

713
00:54:44,928 --> 00:54:47,241
I must tell you the story of their travel.

714
00:54:47,445 --> 00:54:51,038
They came and they said that there’s
a train from Kiev

715
00:54:51,239 --> 00:54:53,728
and they also bought the tickets so got
into the train

716
00:54:53,929 --> 00:54:59,137
and they were off-loaded before
the Hungarian border.

717
00:54:59,338 --> 00:55:02,526
They didn’t know what to do, they had
no visas, nothing

718
00:55:02,727 --> 00:55:05,549
and not so much money also. They thought,
“We are on the train.”

719
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:07,725
They said, “No, you have to go cross over

720
00:55:07,926 --> 00:55:09,645
and go to Budapest,” and they didn’t
know where,

721
00:55:09,845 --> 00:55:13,873
they were standing on the road. And,
but they were all laughing

722
00:55:14,074 --> 00:55:17,186
and enjoying, “must be something in store
for us.”

723
00:55:17,387 --> 00:55:19,729
Nobody felt that they were in trouble
or in anything.

724
00:55:19,930 --> 00:55:22,714
So surrendered. “So, suddenly,” they said,

725
00:55:22,915 --> 00:55:25,207
“the custom people came and surrounded
them,” and they said,

726
00:55:25,408 --> 00:55:29,588
“What’s the matter, how are you here
with all these bags and baggage?”

727
00:55:29,789 --> 00:55:33,523
So they said, “Why are you here?” They
said, “We have come for a concert and this,

728
00:55:33,724 --> 00:55:37,866
and musicians we are and all.” And some
or other they started melting away.

729
00:55:38,067 --> 00:55:39,975
And then they gave them Realisation!

730
00:55:40,176 --> 00:55:44,397
Six of them got Realisation. Now can you
believe: the power of love.

731
00:55:44,598 --> 00:55:50,513
And the custom officers they offered their
own cars, took them down to the other side.

732
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,215
It’s never happened with custom officers!
Imagine!

733
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:56,905
It would be like shaving their teeth off,
I tell you,

734
00:55:57,106 --> 00:56:03,417
the way if you can do that to the custom
officer! But it happened.

735
00:56:03,618 --> 00:56:06,618
And they came to the other side and left
them there.

736
00:56:06,819 --> 00:56:09,155
Now they didn’t know what to do. They
wanted to go to Budapest,

737
00:56:09,356 --> 00:56:13,053
they had to walk about two miles or
something to the station.

738
00:56:13,254 --> 00:56:18,023
So they were waiting there well, they
said that, “Mother, You sent maybe,

739
00:56:18,224 --> 00:56:24,099
two Yugoslavs came in a big bus of 49
people – all vacant.”

740
00:56:24,300 --> 00:56:27,258
They stopped the bus and said, “What is it,
why are you here?”

741
00:56:27,459 --> 00:56:29,459
So they said, “This is our problem and we
have to go.”

742
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:32,963
So they got into the bus. When he was
driving them down,

743
00:56:33,164 --> 00:56:36,976
they thought of talking to him that, “Why
not you take us to Milan?”

744
00:56:37,177 --> 00:56:40,168
And they managed!

745
00:56:41,276 --> 00:56:45,237
And they were in Milan. It’s so remarkable.

746
00:56:45,438 --> 00:56:48,807
So to have faith completely in yourself

747
00:56:49,008 --> 00:56:52,793
and in that Power, which is surrounding
you.

748
00:56:52,994 --> 00:56:56,951
And once you have that faith you will
realise that,

749
00:56:57,152 --> 00:57:01,617
that, though it is so helpful to you, it is
so kind to you,

750
00:57:01,818 --> 00:57:09,739
on the same level if you think it, it can
be very harmful.

751
00:57:09,940 --> 00:57:14,565
So then never listen to the Guruninda,

752
00:57:14,766 --> 00:57:17,542
means anybody talks anything ill about
your Guru,

753
00:57:17,743 --> 00:57:22,523
just put your hands to your ears,
absolutely, immediately.

754
00:57:22,724 --> 00:57:25,546
I have known of a person who did that
[and] got cancer,

755
00:57:25,747 --> 00:57:28,181
another now in jail, another one there.

756
00:57:28,382 --> 00:57:31,392
So anybody is saying like that just put
your hands.

757
00:57:31,593 --> 00:57:35,719
Because now you know that – what is your
Guru.

758
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:41,787
So you should never hear anything against
your Guru from anyone.

759
00:57:41,988 --> 00:57:45,286
The other day one gentleman asked Me
a question, a newsman.

760
00:57:45,487 --> 00:57:49,036
He said that, “I am told you have made
a castle for Yourself.”

761
00:57:49,237 --> 00:57:51,201
I said, “I have paid for it, I have made it
also.

762
00:57:51,402 --> 00:57:54,423
It was a horrid place, no doubt. But there
are only Sahaja Yogis staying there,

763
00:57:54,624 --> 00:57:58,560
I am not staying there. That’s the best
part.” But that’s all I said.

764
00:57:58,761 --> 00:58:03,805
But on the contrary, they never go and ask
these questions to any gurus on anything.

765
00:58:04,006 --> 00:58:06,851
Because the disciples say, “Yes, so what?
We want to give

766
00:58:07,052 --> 00:58:09,724
to our guru money and this and that.”
They never ask.

767
00:58:09,925 --> 00:58:13,352
But, through Sahaja Yoga, or [by] Myself,
have cured

768
00:58:13,553 --> 00:58:17,654
so many people of incurable diseases –
I could have minted money.

769
00:58:17,855 --> 00:58:22,828
For curing one cancer patient I could have
made a castle, Myself.

770
00:58:23,029 --> 00:58:24,822
So when people say like that you should
say,

771
00:58:25,022 --> 00:58:28,995
“Do you know how many people She has
cured? How much money She could have taken

772
00:58:29,195 --> 00:58:34,411
from them if She was a doctor or She was
a false guru?

773
00:58:34,612 --> 00:58:37,550
How much money She would have made
out of all of them?”

774
00:58:37,751 --> 00:58:40,410
Then they will understand. You see, because
they are being

775
00:58:40,611 --> 00:58:45,518
materialistic they talk like that. And
their attitude is very different

776
00:58:45,736 --> 00:58:48,444
and so, to tell them off is the best way.

777
00:58:48,645 --> 00:58:53,962
Because I have seen that these press people
are absolutely harassed

778
00:58:54,163 --> 00:58:59,217
by the disciples of the false Gurus. Just
they cannot criticise,

779
00:58:59,418 --> 00:59:01,842
they cannot say a word against such
false Gurus.

780
00:59:02,043 --> 00:59:05,068
While I find that Sahaja Yogis still lack

781
00:59:05,268 --> 00:59:11,310
that complete faith in themselves and
complete assertion.

782
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:15,011
Where you have to assert you must assert.

783
00:59:15,212 --> 00:59:19,996
For example, anybody says something wrong
against Me, you have to assert;

784
00:59:20,197 --> 00:59:24,378
must say, “No, not possible. It’s not!” But
I have seen some people

785
00:59:24,578 --> 00:59:28,194
asking Me funny questions who are ‘Sahaja
Yogis’ also!

786
00:59:28,395 --> 00:59:36,523
So the first part is that to see how much
we are sensitive to spirituality.

787
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:40,252
I have seen Sahaja Yogis supporting
somebody who is so negative,

788
00:59:40,452 --> 00:59:45,804
you can’t even bear that person and, [to
them], such a person is something great,

789
00:59:46,005 --> 00:59:49,369
while somebody who is so good they cannot
make it out.

790
00:59:49,570 --> 00:59:52,945
So what’s the use? Your computer is so
faulty, you’ll do…

791
00:59:53,146 --> 00:59:55,239
I mean, the planes will have to run up
and down

792
00:59:55,439 --> 00:59:58,112
if you have such a computer as Sahaja
Yogis are!

793
00:59:58,326 --> 01:00:01,130
Because they just judge the other way
round.

794
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:04,806
A person who is good in Sahaja Yoga, who
has got vibrations,

795
01:00:05,006 --> 01:00:07,119
he may be simple, he may be unassuming,

796
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,020
he may not be so rich, he may not be
so educated,

797
01:00:10,221 --> 01:00:13,593
may not be from some good universities
or anything,

798
01:00:13,794 --> 01:00:16,558
but you must see the vibrations of that
person!

799
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:20,538
What sort of vibrations that person has,
and then you should judge.

800
01:00:20,739 --> 01:00:25,832
Instead of that if you judge that person
only because he’s very good to talk

801
01:00:26,033 --> 01:00:30,342
and he talks well and very scholarly or
something like that, that’s not the point.

802
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:34,140
The point is what are his vibrations! And
once you see those vibrations

803
01:00:34,341 --> 01:00:37,875
and judge them on vibrations, then you are
a Sahaja Yogi,

804
01:00:38,076 --> 01:00:40,681
otherwise I would not call you at all
a Sahaja Yogi.

805
01:00:40,919 --> 01:00:44,186
But for a Guru it is very important.
I have seen sometimes

806
01:00:44,387 --> 01:00:48,499
even the leaders supporting somebody
who is absolutely horrid!

807
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:51,729
I can’t bear that person even for five
minutes!

808
01:00:51,930 --> 01:00:54,122
But here the guru sends him over to Me,

809
01:00:54,323 --> 01:00:59,005
“Oh, Mother, he’s so good, you know, he
donated so much money.”

810
01:00:59,206 --> 01:01:02,246
It doesn’t matter. You donated money,
so what?

811
01:01:02,447 --> 01:01:04,283
Who asked him to donate money?

812
01:01:04,484 --> 01:01:07,270
But he should not donate his bhoots to us
now anymore!

813
01:01:07,471 --> 01:01:09,858
We don’t want his bhoot! So that’s what
it is.

814
01:01:10,059 --> 01:01:13,256
So the judgment should be correct about
a person

815
01:01:13,457 --> 01:01:17,145
when you say that this man is not good
or that is not good.

816
01:01:17,346 --> 01:01:19,721
But mostly ‘gurus’ themselves are caught up

817
01:01:19,922 --> 01:01:24,684
and then they are ambitious and if somebody
doesn’t listen to them

818
01:01:24,885 --> 01:01:28,312
or somebody wants to give a lecture
at a wrong time and somebody says,

819
01:01:28,513 --> 01:01:31,604
“You shouldn’t talk like this,” or
something, then they get angry.

820
01:01:31,805 --> 01:01:36,308
They are very hot tempered and they provoke
people, they say things sometimes.

821
01:01:36,509 --> 01:01:39,439
And then when people react they say,
“You are a bad Sahaja Yogi.”

822
01:01:39,640 --> 01:01:43,282
That’s not the way. First of all a guru
or a leader

823
01:01:43,483 --> 01:01:49,446
has to be himself a very mild, gentle, and
a good person.

824
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:52,532
He has to be in such a way [that] he should
not demand anything,

825
01:01:52,733 --> 01:01:56,206
should not ask for anything. Never demand
anything!

826
01:01:56,407 --> 01:02:01,191
Anybody who demands cannot be a guru.

827
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:04,561
Respect is to be commanded and not
to be demanded.

828
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:11,302
And so, everything works out well if you
understand that –

829
01:02:11,503 --> 01:02:14,870
once you rise in your ascent, in your
wisdom,

830
01:02:15,070 --> 01:02:19,826
in your awareness and in your Spirit –
automatically all these things happen!

831
01:02:20,035 --> 01:02:23,627
You don’t have to ask for anything, you
don’t have to plead for anything,

832
01:02:23,828 --> 01:02:26,495
you don’t have to complain for anything,
everything works out.

833
01:02:26,696 --> 01:02:31,160
You are looked after by all the ganas,
by all the angels.

834
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:33,563
They are there. You are on the stage.

835
01:02:33,764 --> 01:02:36,272
But if you are halfway then they play
tricks with you.

836
01:02:36,473 --> 01:02:40,114
You see, they play tricks, they make you
falter, you have problems,

837
01:02:40,315 --> 01:02:43,410
you go here, you go there, all these
things happen

838
01:02:43,611 --> 01:02:45,835
and then you say, “Mother, how is it
this happened?”

839
01:02:46,036 --> 01:02:49,973
Because they are also jokers, so they play
jokes with you

840
01:02:50,174 --> 01:02:54,800
and they make problems for you just to make
you understand that you are doing wrong.

841
01:02:55,001 --> 01:02:59,518
So we are on a stage where there’s
a beautiful security,

842
01:02:59,719 --> 01:03:03,860
everything is there and we have to give
to the world

843
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:05,876
such a great thing like Sahaja Yoga,

844
01:03:06,077 --> 01:03:09,437
which is for the emancipation of the whole
world, as you realise,

845
01:03:09,638 --> 01:03:12,958
and so also I hope you realise your
responsibilities.

846
01:03:13,175 --> 01:03:18,237
There are so many things one has to
understand, how one has to be as a guru,

847
01:03:18,452 --> 01:03:21,274
how he has to act and how he has to work
out.

848
01:03:21,475 --> 01:03:23,867
Now I have given so many lectures
on Guru things,

849
01:03:24,068 --> 01:03:27,400
but, for today’s lecture, only I have
to say

850
01:03:27,601 --> 01:03:32,995
that, first thing, to have a guru system,

851
01:03:33,196 --> 01:03:35,916
you must have complete humility.

852
01:03:36,117 --> 01:03:41,285
Now, with Me, I would say, I am too simple

853
01:03:41,486 --> 01:03:44,858
and I am Mahamaya, so you be very careful.

854
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:49,439
You cannot take liberties with Me. You
cannot take.

855
01:03:49,640 --> 01:03:54,411
If you try to take too much liberties that
means you are not a disciple.

856
01:03:54,612 --> 01:03:58,503
A disciple has to keep a distance from
the Guru.

857
01:03:58,704 --> 01:04:01,400
You cannot just take liberties, walk into
My room every time,

858
01:04:01,601 --> 01:04:04,892
sit there for hours together, chit-chat
with Me – nothing!

859
01:04:05,093 --> 01:04:06,639
You have no right.

860
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:12,470
Only when I call you, when I ask for you,
you should come.

861
01:04:12,671 --> 01:04:15,343
Then you should not force things on
the Guru that,

862
01:04:15,544 --> 01:04:20,749
“Please, come and listen to this,” or,
“Do this!” that should not be said.

863
01:04:20,965 --> 01:04:23,324
For example, yesterday nobody told Me there
are going to be

864
01:04:23,524 --> 01:04:25,999
these music programs or everything
arranged.

865
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:30,924
So you have to report everything to your
leader, or to Me,

866
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:34,760
all those things that you want to do.
And it should be really transparent.

867
01:04:34,961 --> 01:04:37,330
Like this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing,

868
01:04:37,531 --> 01:04:39,769
and this hand knows everything that this
hand is doing.

869
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:42,979
In the same way everybody should know
each other.

870
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:48,631
Then the gurus should not have jealousies
for each other.

871
01:04:48,902 --> 01:04:52,431
This I’m just telling you because also
I found out

872
01:04:52,632 --> 01:04:56,953
that there are certain jealousies. And when
they talk there is a little bit of,

873
01:04:57,154 --> 01:05:00,695
“Ha, he’s good, but this, this, this.”

874
01:05:00,896 --> 01:05:03,437
When they enjoy each other’s company

875
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:06,059
because they have reached a certain state

876
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:08,093
and they understand, “This is the state
we are in.”

877
01:05:08,294 --> 01:05:12,550
When they enjoy each other’s company fully
and appreciate each other

878
01:05:12,751 --> 01:05:17,959
much more than anybody else – the guru’s
company.

879
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:24,807
All the company of the leaders, if they
enjoy each other

880
01:05:25,008 --> 01:05:29,225
and there’s no jealousy, there’s no fight,
there’s no problem

881
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,048
but just the enjoyment of the company,

882
01:05:31,249 --> 01:05:34,008
then they should know that they have
become a guru.

883
01:05:34,209 --> 01:05:37,259
Now all of them never fought with each
other. They supported.

884
01:05:37,460 --> 01:05:40,716
Actually it is one Principle was born again
and again.

885
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:46,443
But only the satanic people – they’ll fight
among themselves, not the godly.

886
01:05:46,644 --> 01:05:52,161
And also they will talk against the person
who is a realised soul

887
01:05:52,362 --> 01:05:55,400
or who is an Incarnation, but never
against themselves.

888
01:05:55,601 --> 01:05:59,333
It’s very surprising that the satanic
people,

889
01:05:59,534 --> 01:06:01,723
though they fight among themselves, there
are jealousies,

890
01:06:01,924 --> 01:06:04,403
they’ll never talk of each other.

891
01:06:04,604 --> 01:06:07,919
But here I find that in Sahaja Yoga we
have freedom.

892
01:06:08,120 --> 01:06:10,590
But freedom is not abandonment,
is the freedom

893
01:06:10,814 --> 01:06:14,092
with complete rules and regulations
of the Divine, with us,

894
01:06:14,355 --> 01:06:18,397
and we have to know them that this is
the Divine Law.

895
01:06:18,598 --> 01:06:24,396
So all of us are now sitting like in a big
vimana, like an aeroplane,

896
01:06:24,597 --> 01:06:28,117
and we all have to land into the beautiful
area.

897
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:34,423
But first of all we have to develop that
humility in your heart;

898
01:06:34,624 --> 01:06:37,885
complete humility and surrender, that’s
very important.

899
01:06:38,086 --> 01:06:42,042
Unless and until you have that humility
and surrender in your heart,

900
01:06:42,243 --> 01:06:45,157
Guru principle cannot be awakened.

901
01:06:45,358 --> 01:06:48,924
First you have to be the disciple and then
the guru.

902
01:06:49,125 --> 01:06:51,678
So you have to develop that humility.

903
01:06:51,879 --> 01:06:58,470
And that humility comes very easily if
you love Me, respect Me.

904
01:06:58,671 --> 01:07:02,716
It’s not only love, but respect.

905
01:07:03,304 --> 01:07:09,434
That respect has to be there and then
people will respect you.

906
01:07:09,635 --> 01:07:12,004
May God bless you.
