WEBVTT

07:51.620 --> 07:56.510
It is a great pleasure for Me,

07:58.510 --> 08:00.560
greatest joy

08:01.500 --> 08:04.620
to see so many Sahaja Yogis

08:07.151 --> 08:09.560
for the Guru Puja.

08:11.510 --> 08:13.580
It’s very gratifying

08:15.024 --> 08:18.550
to think that there are so many,

08:19.159 --> 08:27.440
so many of you who are disciples.

08:35.600 --> 08:38.510
It was never expected

08:39.620 --> 08:42.440
that I’ll have so many,

08:43.080 --> 08:48.600
so many people following Me.

08:53.520 --> 09:03.600
It is being expected

09:06.460 --> 09:08.440
that you all will

09:10.480 --> 09:17.410
follow My message of Love.

09:20.630 --> 09:26.600
I do not have to say anything for Love.

09:29.480 --> 09:38.550
Love is absolute gift,

09:42.430 --> 09:49.410
gift of just feeling others.

09:52.410 --> 09:56.600
There is no talking about it,

09:57.480 --> 10:01.400
discussing about it, nothing;

10:02.400 --> 10:08.550
just you feel that Love.

10:12.550 --> 10:20.510
To feel the Love, I would say, one has to have a heart,

10:21.490 --> 10:24.400
but how can you have a heart?

10:25.550 --> 10:32.430
It is not your own doing, it’s all there.

10:34.630 --> 10:43.570
So, it is something is already gifted to you, you have it,

10:45.410 --> 10:47.590
that you can feel that Love.

10:50.600 --> 10:56.630
It’s so much joy - giving, peace - giving.

10:58.410 --> 11:05.400
Love has its own qualities

11:06.620 --> 11:13.450
and one of the qualities is that Love understands.

11:14.520 --> 11:17.520
Its understanding is not in words,

11:18.460 --> 11:20.400
not in thought,

11:21.480 --> 11:24.400
but understands within.

11:27.450 --> 11:29.570
It can feel within,

11:33.400 --> 11:34.630
which is very important.

11:38.400 --> 11:40.570
This is the most important part

11:42.440 --> 11:44.510
one has to realize

11:46.540 --> 11:52.460
that Love you can only feel it.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.410
You cannot talk about it,

11:57.460 --> 11:59.540
you cannot show about it,

12:00.540 --> 12:03.630
but it is within and you can feel it.

12:07.510 --> 12:09.550
And that is why today

12:10.430 --> 12:18.510
is your celebration of the Guru.

12:21.590 --> 12:23.620
It’s the celebration where

12:26.590 --> 12:33.430
you can feel that Love for your Guru.

12:34.590 --> 12:39.570
That feeling is within

12:41.490 --> 12:46.480
and only in within you can feel that.

12:47.590 --> 12:53.560
So, we have to understand it’s not the show,

12:55.460 --> 12:59.630
it’s nothing else but just the feeling within

13:00.620 --> 13:07.590
that you know that you have Love of the Divine.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.550
This you can have because

13:14.410 --> 13:17.630
it is just there.

13:18.600 --> 13:20.590
No one can give you,

13:21.630 --> 13:24.410
no one can sell it,

13:25.400 --> 13:29.490
no one can share it - it’s just there.

13:31.430 --> 13:37.430
And that Love has to be felt and shared.

13:39.430 --> 13:43.620
It has nothing to do with others;

13:45.570 --> 13:49.600
whether others love you or not makes no difference.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.430
It’s within yourself,

13:55.540 --> 13:57.410
this feeling,

13:58.430 --> 14:03.590
this depth is there which you enjoy.

14:10.530 --> 14:14.530
It is the capacity -

14:15.610 --> 14:20.480
every one has this, lots of it.

14:22.450 --> 14:26.620
Sometimes you feel it, you have lost it;

14:27.420 --> 14:30.510
Sometimes you feel you have gained it.

14:31.450 --> 14:42.470
But it is there as much as the expanse of a sea.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.550
Sea, you cannot say

14:46.470 --> 14:49.610
today is full and tomorrow is not.

14:50.530 --> 14:52.530
It is eternal.

14:53.550 --> 15:00.480
In the same way, the source of your Love is eternal.

15:02.420 --> 15:09.580
You cannot measure it,

15:15.550 --> 15:18.450
it’s difficult.

15:20.640 --> 15:25.510
But it’s beyond all your human expressions

15:26.510 --> 15:37.530
and it shows your understanding,

15:39.450 --> 15:41.550
your understanding of Love,

15:42.480 --> 15:44.530
which has no words,

15:45.560 --> 15:47.550
which cannot explain;

15:48.560 --> 15:51.500
but by itself you will know

15:52.470 --> 15:56.530
that "I have this quality to love

15:57.450 --> 15:59.550
within myself

16:00.470 --> 16:05.560
and I can enjoy with this Love within myself."

16:06.550 --> 16:16.480
This is a very unique gift

16:17.640 --> 16:26.450
which only very few human beings have.

16:29.480 --> 16:34.560
Among animals also you find people who have love,

16:35.610 --> 16:40.450
but that love is not deep,

16:41.420 --> 16:44.420
that love has no meaning.

16:47.530 --> 16:51.500
It has some purpose maybe,

16:52.450 --> 16:54.630
but it is not human,

16:56.440 --> 17:00.580
so, it lacks the beauty of human Love,

17:01.580 --> 17:09.530
It lacks the understanding of human Love.

17:13.580 --> 17:15.640
It is not easy to describe

17:16.590 --> 17:21.640
or explain Love in human words.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.450
This you can only feel within your Self.

17:29.410 --> 17:32.550
That is what, once you start feeling,

17:33.420 --> 17:38.550
you can feel who is your Guru,

17:40.500 --> 17:48.590
Whom do you think you are being taught

17:48.640 --> 17:56.450
and persuaded and made to live in a particular manner.

17:57.470 --> 17:59.550
All that is possible.

18:03.410 --> 18:04.640
Everything is possible,

18:05.480 --> 18:07.450
humanly possible,

18:07.560 --> 18:13.440
but to love and to enjoy Love

18:13.490 --> 18:16.470
is not so easy,

18:17.420 --> 18:21.520
unless and until you are immersed in it.

18:27.580 --> 18:30.410
It’s very gratifying,

18:30.590 --> 18:35.590
it is very lovable

18:37.440 --> 18:40.580
to see how people love each other

18:43.580 --> 18:51.640
and then this Love spreads.

18:54.550 --> 18:57.590
Love begets Love.

18:59.550 --> 19:07.410
If somebody has Love, it just spreads.

19:08.420 --> 19:10.450
You need not tell anyone,

19:11.560 --> 19:13.610
you need not confess it,

19:14.420 --> 19:18.500
but it will spread.

19:19.530 --> 19:24.560
And this is what one has to learn,

19:26.510 --> 19:31.560
how to see that Love in other person.

19:36.530 --> 19:38.470
Somehow,

19:39.530 --> 19:44.540
we are here already in Love

19:45.530 --> 19:49.640
because of Sahaj happening.

19:50.620 --> 19:53.590
We all love

19:54.510 --> 19:56.540
and we enjoy love,

19:57.480 --> 19:59.500
shows on our faces

20:00.480 --> 20:02.640
that we are in Love;

20:03.610 --> 20:06.420
in our characters,

20:08.450 --> 20:10.430
in our lives,

20:10.620 --> 20:13.420
that we are in Love.

20:14.510 --> 20:16.450
What a thing,

20:16.600 --> 20:20.530
which is not very normal,

20:20.590 --> 20:22.640
becomes so normal

20:23.560 --> 20:26.480
and so easily available.

20:27.450 --> 20:30.540
It is a very big blessing

20:31.540 --> 20:33.640
that you are human beings

20:34.530 --> 20:40.490
and that this source of Love

20:41.530 --> 20:47.480
is there, plus the feeling for Love is there.

20:48.450 --> 20:52.640
It’s a very intricate situation

20:53.540 --> 20:57.450
which cannot be explained in words,

20:59.490 --> 21:03.460
only one can be in it

21:03.540 --> 21:05.570
and enjoy it.

21:08.480 --> 21:10.530
So today is the day

21:10.590 --> 21:16.620
when we are celebrating the Guru Puja.

21:19.480 --> 21:26.540
The greatest Guru that we have is Love,

21:27.510 --> 21:34.460
Sahaj Love. It's the Guru within us which teaches us,

21:35.400 --> 21:37.560
which somehow or other leads us.

21:38.560 --> 21:42.640
We are lead into that

21:43.540 --> 21:50.500
great line of understanding,

21:51.590 --> 21:55.480
for which we don’t have to go to any college,

21:55.590 --> 21:58.560
to any school for education.

21:59.460 --> 22:02.400
It is something so much within

22:02.570 --> 22:12.530
that it works and expresses itself,

22:13.420 --> 22:16.560
expresses like a light.

22:17.500 --> 22:21.450
Such people we can make out because

22:21.600 --> 22:24.480
they are fully enlightened.

22:25.460 --> 22:27.450
They have light

22:27.600 --> 22:30.420
and through that light they see

22:30.560 --> 22:32.490
the whole world,

22:32.620 --> 22:37.400
which is very innocent and simple for them.

22:45.430 --> 22:51.510
We have love for our children naturally,

22:52.430 --> 22:55.500
we have love for our parents naturally.

22:56.460 --> 23:00.400
We have love for some people;

23:00.530 --> 23:02.560
but that love is different

23:03.400 --> 23:06.480
from God’s Love, I’m telling you.

23:07.620 --> 23:11.530
That has some connections,

23:12.400 --> 23:13.610
some meanings

23:14.450 --> 23:23.590
but this Love which is -

23:26.500 --> 23:31.530
cannot be described in words,

23:31.620 --> 23:34.510
has to be felt within.

23:37.480 --> 23:40.600
Same, when you talk of your Guru,

23:42.450 --> 23:46.640
you should have that Love within you.

23:49.400 --> 23:53.480
Why do you feel it so much?

23:56.590 --> 24:02.530
The reason is, Guru loves you

24:03.540 --> 24:05.590
and you love Guru;

24:06.530 --> 24:08.640
That’s the only reason

24:09.540 --> 24:12.510
why should you love your Guru.

24:13.460 --> 24:15.640
Now, there's no reason for that.

24:16.570 --> 24:19.450
Because Love is Love.

24:20.480 --> 24:22.460
and that is how

24:23.480 --> 24:27.640
the Guru becomes very important in life.

24:29.420 --> 24:31.420
We have people

24:31.620 --> 24:35.570
who love their Guru

24:37.480 --> 24:39.560
and are very much

24:41.590 --> 24:50.420
in chaste understanding of their Love.

24:52.530 --> 24:57.450
In this great opportunity of Love that we are,

24:58.460 --> 25:04.560
we are here to enjoy each other fully,

25:05.530 --> 25:07.480
from our heart,

25:08.500 --> 25:14.560
that there is this ocean within us,

25:16.450 --> 25:20.430
we have to just get submerged in that ocean.

25:20.560 --> 25:23.420
If we are lost in that ocean,

25:23.540 --> 25:27.560
then we’ll have no problems,

25:29.430 --> 25:31.480
no questions.

25:32.510 --> 25:35.530
Everything will be our own

25:36.510 --> 25:38.500
and we can manage

25:38.610 --> 25:43.500
everything without any argument,

25:43.570 --> 25:46.620
without any questioning.

25:48.620 --> 25:52.640
That is what is being Sahaj.

25:53.470 --> 25:56.430
The Sahaj way, if you have

25:56.560 --> 26:00.450
this Love, you enjoy.

26:00.570 --> 26:04.430
You enjoy yourself and enjoy everybody else,

26:04.500 --> 26:06.610
because it is Sahaj.

26:07.450 --> 26:09.530
Don’t have to make any efforts,

26:10.400 --> 26:12.500
don’t have to try anything.

26:12.590 --> 26:15.610
Just it is there and it works.

26:21.480 --> 26:28.500
The feeling of Love

26:29.610 --> 26:35.510
has no way of expressing itself.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.480
It is just there,

26:40.430 --> 26:42.470
it cannot express,

26:43.610 --> 26:48.590
because it is without expression.

26:50.460 --> 26:55.620
It is just to be felt within yourself.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.610
Then you want to do so many things:

27:01.620 --> 27:04.450
you want to help everyone,

27:04.610 --> 27:07.450
you want to help yourself,

27:08.430 --> 27:12.560
you want to do good to others.

27:13.480 --> 27:18.590
So much has been done by great leaders of the world

27:19.450 --> 27:21.610
because they had that Love.

27:22.470 --> 27:25.400
They had nothing else but this Love

27:25.590 --> 27:29.540
which they could not contain them within themselves,

27:29.610 --> 27:33.640
so, they tried to spread it.

27:34.540 --> 27:38.560
And they are called now as our Guru,

27:39.480 --> 27:41.560
as our masters.

27:42.460 --> 27:44.600
With that Love within,

27:45.600 --> 27:51.640
which approached people in that unique manner.

27:53.470 --> 27:55.610
That’s the thing that

27:57.530 --> 27:59.600
we cannot possess,

28:00.450 --> 28:02.490
you cannot claim -

28:03.640 --> 28:05.640
it is there

28:06.600 --> 28:08.640
and it works,

28:10.460 --> 28:12.490
it works automatically.

28:14.580 --> 28:16.600
This is what we have to know,

28:17.410 --> 28:23.520
that we are that Love.

28:25.480 --> 28:26.600
That Love is within us.

28:27.420 --> 28:31.600
We have to have knowledge,

28:32.540 --> 28:36.460
we have to have a complete knowledge

28:36.590 --> 28:41.420
that we are that Love.

28:42.570 --> 28:45.560
That will solve our problem,

28:46.610 --> 28:48.570
because you can explain everything,

28:48.640 --> 28:50.570
all your behaviour,

28:51.510 --> 28:53.400
all your failures,

28:53.460 --> 28:55.610
everything you can explain

28:56.420 --> 29:01.430
when you know that you are endowed with that Love.

29:04.400 --> 29:06.570
This is what is the Guru

29:07.480 --> 29:10.430
is the Love within you

29:11.400 --> 29:12.640
which wants to share

29:13.510 --> 29:15.540
Love with others,

29:17.420 --> 29:20.610
which wants to give Love to others.

29:25.400 --> 29:30.460
This is what is peace and joy.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.570
I can go on talking on Love,

29:35.620 --> 29:39.570
but to feel it

29:42.410 --> 29:45.550
within yourself is the biggest thing.

29:46.600 --> 29:48.490
Like water:

29:48.630 --> 29:50.580
if you are thirsty,

29:51.490 --> 29:53.460
we can give you water,

29:53.640 --> 29:55.600
but we cannot drink.

29:56.470 --> 29:58.470
You have to drink water

29:58.570 --> 30:00.630
and you have to

30:03.530 --> 30:05.570
feel the taste,

30:06.490 --> 30:08.430
feel the feeling,

30:08.550 --> 30:10.500
what it does,

30:10.600 --> 30:14.640
and all that is together,

30:15.640 --> 30:18.500
that’s not separate.

30:19.470 --> 30:20.610
I don’t think the subject

30:21.410 --> 30:23.580
was too subtle for you people.

30:24.500 --> 30:27.500
You all have reached a certain amount

30:27.640 --> 30:30.610
of understanding of that Love.

30:32.570 --> 30:36.470
I hope, it grows

30:37.430 --> 30:39.520
and you grow into it,

30:39.630 --> 30:43.490
all of you, and enjoy it.

30:43.640 --> 30:46.540
May God bless you!
