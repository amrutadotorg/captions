00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:56.510
It is a great pleasure for Me,

00:07:58.510 --> 00:08:00.560
greatest joy

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.620
to see so many Sahaja Yogis

00:08:07.151 --> 00:08:09.560
for the Guru Puja.

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:13.580
It’s very gratifying

00:08:15.024 --> 00:08:18.550
to think that there are so many,

00:08:19.159 --> 00:08:27.440
so many of you who are disciples.

00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:38.510
It was never expected

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.440
that I’ll have so many,

00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.600
so many people following Me.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:09:03.600
It is being expected

00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:08.440
that you all will

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:17.410
follow My message of Love.

00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:26.600
I do not have to say anything for Love.

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:38.550
Love is absolute gift,

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:49.410
gift of just feeling others.

00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:56.600
There is no talking about it,

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:01.400
discussing about it, nothing;

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:08.550
just you feel that Love.

00:10:12.550 --> 00:10:20.510
To feel the Love, I would say, one has to have a heart,

00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:24.400
but how can you have a heart?

00:10:25.550 --> 00:10:32.430
It is not your own doing, it’s all there.

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:43.570
So, it is something is already gifted to you, you have it,

00:10:45.410 --> 00:10:47.590
that you can feel that Love.

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:56.630
It’s so much joy - giving, peace - giving.

00:10:58.410 --> 00:11:05.400
Love has its own qualities

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:13.450
and one of the qualities is that Love understands.

00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.520
Its understanding is not in words,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:20.400
not in thought,

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.400
but understands within.

00:11:27.450 --> 00:11:29.570
It can feel within,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.630
which is very important.

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.570
This is the most important part

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:44.510
one has to realize

00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:52.460
that Love you can only feel it.

00:11:53.540 --> 00:11:56.410
You cannot talk about it,

00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:59.540
you cannot show about it,

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:03.630
but it is within and you can feel it.

00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:09.550
And that is why today

00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:18.510
is your celebration of the Guru.

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:23.620
It’s the celebration where

00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:33.430
you can feel that Love for your Guru.

00:12:34.590 --> 00:12:39.570
That feeling is within

00:12:41.490 --> 00:12:46.480
and only in within you can feel that.

00:12:47.590 --> 00:12:53.560
So, we have to understand it’s not the show,

00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:59.630
it’s nothing else but just the feeling within

00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:07.590
that you know that you have Love of the Divine.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.550
This you can have because

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:17.630
it is just there.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.590
No one can give you,

00:13:21.630 --> 00:13:24.410
no one can sell it,

00:13:25.400 --> 00:13:29.490
no one can share it - it’s just there.

00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:37.430
And that Love has to be felt and shared.

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:43.620
It has nothing to do with others;

00:13:45.570 --> 00:13:49.600
whether others love you or not makes no difference.

00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:54.430
It’s within yourself,

00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.410
this feeling,

00:13:58.430 --> 00:14:03.590
this depth is there which you enjoy.

00:14:10.530 --> 00:14:14.530
It is the capacity -

00:14:15.610 --> 00:14:20.480
every one has this, lots of it.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:26.620
Sometimes you feel it, you have lost it;

00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.510
Sometimes you feel you have gained it.

00:14:31.450 --> 00:14:42.470
But it is there as much as the expanse of a sea.

00:14:43.450 --> 00:14:45.550
Sea, you cannot say

00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:49.610
today is full and tomorrow is not.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:52.530
It is eternal.

00:14:53.550 --> 00:15:00.480
In the same way, the source of your Love is eternal.

00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:09.580
You cannot measure it,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:18.450
it’s difficult.

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:25.510
But it’s beyond all your human expressions

00:15:26.510 --> 00:15:37.530
and it shows your understanding,

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.550
your understanding of Love,

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:44.530
which has no words,

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:47.550
which cannot explain;

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:51.500
but by itself you will know

00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:56.530
that "I have this quality to love

00:15:57.450 --> 00:15:59.550
within myself

00:16:00.470 --> 00:16:05.560
and I can enjoy with this Love within myself."

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:16.480
This is a very unique gift

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:26.450
which only very few human beings have.

00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:34.560
Among animals also you find people who have love,

00:16:35.610 --> 00:16:40.450
but that love is not deep,

00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:44.420
that love has no meaning.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.500
It has some purpose maybe,

00:16:52.450 --> 00:16:54.630
but it is not human,

00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.580
so, it lacks the beauty of human Love,

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:09.530
It lacks the understanding of human Love.

00:17:13.580 --> 00:17:15.640
It is not easy to describe

00:17:16.590 --> 00:17:21.640
or explain Love in human words.

00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.450
This you can only feel within your Self.

00:17:29.410 --> 00:17:32.550
That is what, once you start feeling,

00:17:33.420 --> 00:17:38.550
you can feel who is your Guru,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:48.590
Whom do you think you are being taught

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:56.450
and persuaded and made to live in a particular manner.

00:17:57.470 --> 00:17:59.550
All that is possible.

00:18:03.410 --> 00:18:04.640
Everything is possible,

00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:07.450
humanly possible,

00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:13.440
but to love and to enjoy Love

00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.470
is not so easy,

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.520
unless and until you are immersed in it.

00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:30.410
It’s very gratifying,

00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:35.590
it is very lovable

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.580
to see how people love each other

00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:51.640
and then this Love spreads.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:57.590
Love begets Love.

00:18:59.550 --> 00:19:07.410
If somebody has Love, it just spreads.

00:19:08.420 --> 00:19:10.450
You need not tell anyone,

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:13.610
you need not confess it,

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:18.500
but it will spread.

00:19:19.530 --> 00:19:24.560
And this is what one has to learn,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:31.560
how to see that Love in other person.

00:19:36.530 --> 00:19:38.470
Somehow,

00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:44.540
we are here already in Love

00:19:45.530 --> 00:19:49.640
because of Sahaj happening.

00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:53.590
We all love

00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:56.540
and we enjoy love,

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.500
shows on our faces

00:20:00.480 --> 00:20:02.640
that we are in Love;

00:20:03.610 --> 00:20:06.420
in our characters,

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.430
in our lives,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:13.420
that we are in Love.

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:16.450
What a thing,

00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.530
which is not very normal,

00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:22.640
becomes so normal

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.480
and so easily available.

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:30.540
It is a very big blessing

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:33.640
that you are human beings

00:20:34.530 --> 00:20:40.490
and that this source of Love

00:20:41.530 --> 00:20:47.480
is there, plus the feeling for Love is there.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.640
It’s a very intricate situation

00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:57.450
which cannot be explained in words,

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:03.460
only one can be in it

00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:05.570
and enjoy it.

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.530
So today is the day

00:21:10.590 --> 00:21:16.620
when we are celebrating the Guru Puja.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:26.540
The greatest Guru that we have is Love,

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:34.460
Sahaj Love. It's the Guru within us which teaches us,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.560
which somehow or other leads us.

00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:42.640
We are lead into that

00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:50.500
great line of understanding,

00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:55.480
for which we don’t have to go to any college,

00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:58.560
to any school for education.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.400
It is something so much within

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:12.530
that it works and expresses itself,

00:22:13.420 --> 00:22:16.560
expresses like a light.

00:22:17.500 --> 00:22:21.450
Such people we can make out because

00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:24.480
they are fully enlightened.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.450
They have light

00:22:27.600 --> 00:22:30.420
and through that light they see

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:32.490
the whole world,

00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:37.400
which is very innocent and simple for them.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:51.510
We have love for our children naturally,

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:55.500
we have love for our parents naturally.

00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:00.400
We have love for some people;

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.560
but that love is different

00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:06.480
from God’s Love, I’m telling you.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:11.530
That has some connections,

00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:13.610
some meanings

00:23:14.450 --> 00:23:23.590
but this Love which is -

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:31.530
cannot be described in words,

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.510
has to be felt within.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.600
Same, when you talk of your Guru,

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:46.640
you should have that Love within you.

00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.480
Why do you feel it so much?

00:23:56.590 --> 00:24:02.530
The reason is, Guru loves you

00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:05.590
and you love Guru;

00:24:06.530 --> 00:24:08.640
That’s the only reason

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:12.510
why should you love your Guru.

00:24:13.460 --> 00:24:15.640
Now, there's no reason for that.

00:24:16.570 --> 00:24:19.450
Because Love is Love.

00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:22.460
and that is how

00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:27.640
the Guru becomes very important in life.

00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.420
We have people

00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:35.570
who love their Guru

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.560
and are very much

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:50.420
in chaste understanding of their Love.

00:24:52.530 --> 00:24:57.450
In this great opportunity of Love that we are,

00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:04.560
we are here to enjoy each other fully,

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:07.480
from our heart,

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:14.560
that there is this ocean within us,

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:20.430
we have to just get submerged in that ocean.

00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:23.420
If we are lost in that ocean,

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:27.560
then we’ll have no problems,

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:31.480
no questions.

00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:35.530
Everything will be our own

00:25:36.510 --> 00:25:38.500
and we can manage

00:25:38.610 --> 00:25:43.500
everything without any argument,

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.620
without any questioning.

00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:52.640
That is what is being Sahaj.

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:56.430
The Sahaj way, if you have

00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:00.450
this Love, you enjoy.

00:26:00.570 --> 00:26:04.430
You enjoy yourself and enjoy everybody else,

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.610
because it is Sahaj.

00:26:07.450 --> 00:26:09.530
Don’t have to make any efforts,

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.500
don’t have to try anything.

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:15.610
Just it is there and it works.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:28.500
The feeling of Love

00:26:29.610 --> 00:26:35.510
has no way of expressing itself.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.480
It is just there,

00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:42.470
it cannot express,

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:48.590
because it is without expression.

00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:55.620
It is just to be felt within yourself.

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:00.610
Then you want to do so many things:

00:27:01.620 --> 00:27:04.450
you want to help everyone,

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:07.450
you want to help yourself,

00:27:08.430 --> 00:27:12.560
you want to do good to others.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.590
So much has been done by great leaders of the world

00:27:19.450 --> 00:27:21.610
because they had that Love.

00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:25.400
They had nothing else but this Love

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:29.540
which they could not contain them within themselves,

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:33.640
so, they tried to spread it.

00:27:34.540 --> 00:27:38.560
And they are called now as our Guru,

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:41.560
as our masters.

00:27:42.460 --> 00:27:44.600
With that Love within,

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:51.640
which approached people in that unique manner.

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:55.610
That’s the thing that

00:27:57.530 --> 00:27:59.600
we cannot possess,

00:28:00.450 --> 00:28:02.490
you cannot claim -

00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:05.640
it is there

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.640
and it works,

00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:12.490
it works automatically.

00:28:14.580 --> 00:28:16.600
This is what we have to know,

00:28:17.410 --> 00:28:23.520
that we are that Love.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.600
That Love is within us.

00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:31.600
We have to have knowledge,

00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:36.460
we have to have a complete knowledge

00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:41.420
that we are that Love.

00:28:42.570 --> 00:28:45.560
That will solve our problem,

00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:48.570
because you can explain everything,

00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:50.570
all your behaviour,

00:28:51.510 --> 00:28:53.400
all your failures,

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:55.610
everything you can explain

00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.430
when you know that you are endowed with that Love.

00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:06.570
This is what is the Guru

00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:10.430
is the Love within you

00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:12.640
which wants to share

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:15.540
Love with others,

00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:20.610
which wants to give Love to others.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:30.460
This is what is peace and joy.

00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:34.570
I can go on talking on Love,

00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.570
but to feel it

00:29:42.410 --> 00:29:45.550
within yourself is the biggest thing.

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:48.490
Like water:

00:29:48.630 --> 00:29:50.580
if you are thirsty,

00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:53.460
we can give you water,

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.600
but we cannot drink.

00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:58.470
You have to drink water

00:29:58.570 --> 00:30:00.630
and you have to

00:30:03.530 --> 00:30:05.570
feel the taste,

00:30:06.490 --> 00:30:08.430
feel the feeling,

00:30:08.550 --> 00:30:10.500
what it does,

00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:14.640
and all that is together,

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:18.500
that’s not separate.

00:30:19.470 --> 00:30:20.610
I don’t think the subject

00:30:21.410 --> 00:30:23.580
was too subtle for you people.

00:30:24.500 --> 00:30:27.500
You all have reached a certain amount

00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:30.610
of understanding of that Love.

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:36.470
I hope, it grows

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:39.520
and you grow into it,

00:30:39.630 --> 00:30:43.490
all of you, and enjoy it.

00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:46.540
May God bless you!
