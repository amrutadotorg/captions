1
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:44,435
I’m sorry I had to speak in Hindi language,

2
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:53,560
because most of the people who are here
are understanding Hindi only.

3
00:15:54,212 --> 00:16:00,174
When I am abroad, all the time
I am speaking English,

4
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:03,164
nothing else but English language,

5
00:16:03,189 --> 00:16:08,987
and then I want to have some change
for a while.

6
00:16:09,012 --> 00:16:17,845
Regarding today’s great advent
of Shri Jesus Christ,

7
00:16:17,870 --> 00:16:22,949
I told them that He came on this world

8
00:16:23,739 --> 00:16:29,643
with a very great mission, I would say
one of the greatest missions,

9
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:36,624
because He wanted to open the Agnya
Chakra

10
00:16:36,649 --> 00:16:42,217
which was so constricted, and could not
be done before.

11
00:16:42,242 --> 00:16:45,887
For that He had to sacrifice His life.

12
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:54,324
By that sacrifice only, the great Agnya
could be opened.

13
00:16:54,965 --> 00:17:02,528
He was aware of it. He knew that it has
to happen,

14
00:17:02,553 --> 00:17:11,191
that He has to somehow accept this
sacrifice.

15
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:15,358
As it is, He was a divine personality,

16
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:22,116
He had no problem in doing so. But He
thought that

17
00:17:22,141 --> 00:17:33,275
could be some other way there, by which
you can open this Agnya Chakra.

18
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:41,479
But He had to sacrifice His life, and
in that sacrifice He has shown

19
00:17:41,504 --> 00:17:50,462
that if you have to rise above this
mundane, superficial life,

20
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:58,582
you have to in a way sacrifice.
Sacrifice what?

21
00:17:58,607 --> 00:18:05,822
Sacrifice all your six enemies. But
with the Kundalini awakening

22
00:18:05,847 --> 00:18:10,819
all these six enemies completely get
detached.

23
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:19,551
Depends on how your Kundalini has risen.
If she has risen in a perfect manner,

24
00:18:19,576 --> 00:18:22,802
then I have seen people at the first shot

25
00:18:22,827 --> 00:18:27,762
they just become completely self-realized
people.

26
00:18:27,787 --> 00:18:31,140
Of course there are very few, but there
have been;

27
00:18:31,165 --> 00:18:37,631
while I see most of you have little
problems,

28
00:18:37,656 --> 00:18:43,755
and for most of you it is the problem
of the Agnya Chakra.

29
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:48,372
How do we get the Agnya Chakra working
so much is this,

30
00:18:48,412 --> 00:18:56,398
that we think as a reaction, as a reaction

31
00:18:57,079 --> 00:19:02,302
to anything outside, we react to
everything.

32
00:19:02,327 --> 00:19:06,539
While I see here all these lamps, I can
react by saying,

33
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:10,863
“From where did they get all these?
How much it must have cost?

34
00:19:10,888 --> 00:19:17,676
Where are they kept all the year round?”
- All kinds of things. I can react.

35
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:27,074
This reaction comes from our conditionings,
or from our ego.

36
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:33,070
Egoistical people are extremely sensitive.
If you give them, say,

37
00:19:33,095 --> 00:19:37,916
something that they think is not very
dignified, they can feel hurt.

38
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:42,080
They can feel hurt for anything, because
they have a consciousness

39
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:50,294
that they are something special, something
higher people, and one should behave

40
00:19:50,319 --> 00:19:55,283
with them when they are dealing with
anyone.

41
00:19:55,308 --> 00:19:59,198
And that’s how they get absolutely
disturbed

42
00:19:59,223 --> 00:20:04,943
if they find anybody in any way degrading
them.

43
00:20:05,551 --> 00:20:08,278
This comes from ego.

44
00:20:08,303 --> 00:20:14,345
Ego is a part and parcel of this Agnya
movement,

45
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,762
and the second one is your conditioning.

46
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:25,328
Now you have a conditioning: say you are
an Indian, now the conditioning is

47
00:20:25,353 --> 00:20:32,264
that a person who comes to meet you
should touch your feet, supposing,

48
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:34,132
that’s your relationship.

49
00:20:34,157 --> 00:20:39,741
And the person doesn’t touch your feet,
then you are angry.

50
00:20:39,766 --> 00:20:43,957
Anything like that which is your
conditioning,

51
00:20:43,982 --> 00:20:48,437
gives you an idea that you are been
insulted

52
00:20:48,462 --> 00:20:55,483
or in any way you have not been
respected, then you feel bad.

53
00:20:55,523 --> 00:20:58,582
The other reactions of ego are like this,

54
00:20:58,607 --> 00:21:04,311
as I said: I see those lamps and I can say,
“Why not I have it?”

55
00:21:04,336 --> 00:21:07,722
Or if I have them, “Why will I give it
to anyone?”

56
00:21:07,747 --> 00:21:12,882
Ego reactions are there, or conditioning
reactions are there.

57
00:21:12,907 --> 00:21:16,710
These two were to be finished, and that
was done

58
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:23,448
by the sacrifice of the life of Christ.
Christ Himself was a divine person,

59
00:21:23,473 --> 00:21:31,668
and a divine person is like the sea because
it remains at the zero point,

60
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:37,054
at the lowest point; it does all work
from that point.

61
00:21:37,094 --> 00:21:45,535
It will make clouds, it will make rain,
and when all the rivers are in spate

62
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:52,475
they’ll run into the sea, because the sea
remains at the lower point.

63
00:21:52,500 --> 00:22:00,075
So humility is the, one of the criteria
of a Sahaja yoga.

64
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:05,606
A person who doesn’t have humility
cannot be called sahaja yogi.

65
00:22:05,631 --> 00:22:09,388
I have seen even sahaja yogis get very
angry,

66
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:13,715
sometimes start shouting and getting angry
and misbehaving.

67
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:18,909
That’s the sign that he is not yet a sahaja
yogi, he has to still mature.

68
00:22:18,934 --> 00:22:29,611
So this humility of a person will give you
more stationary, I would say,

69
00:22:29,636 --> 00:22:39,221
more permanent state by which you will
not react,

70
00:22:39,246 --> 00:22:44,022
you will not react. You look at anything,
you react.

71
00:22:44,047 --> 00:22:46,655
But then you don’t react, you just watch,

72
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,921
and that is how the new state of witness
state comes into you.

73
00:22:51,946 --> 00:22:56,586
When you become the witness you are
just watching,

74
00:22:56,611 --> 00:23:05,679
just watching; not reacting, not thinking
about it, but you are in the present,

75
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:12,195
and in the present you just watch, watch
and really enjoy it.

76
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:20,659
The enjoyment of all the creation is not
within your mind when you are thinking.

77
00:23:20,684 --> 00:23:28,702
And when you are not thinking, the whole
enjoyment of the beauty of all this creation

78
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:34,472
reflects in you, and gives you tremendous
joy and peace.

79
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:40,123
So one has to learn that we should not
react.

80
00:23:40,148 --> 00:23:45,710
The today’s problem is, all human beings
are very good at reacting.

81
00:23:45,735 --> 00:23:50,103
Reaction is a basic principle of today’s
life.

82
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:56,112
You see any newspaper, you see any book,
you meet anyone,

83
00:23:56,137 --> 00:24:01,232
what I find that they are experts
on reacting. They react,

84
00:24:01,257 --> 00:24:11,456
and by reaction what happens, they never
achieve any essence of the thing.

85
00:24:11,481 --> 00:24:17,947
Essence is only through witness state
that you can achieve.

86
00:24:17,972 --> 00:24:25,201
This is what we have to learn from
the crucifixion of Christ,

87
00:24:25,226 --> 00:24:33,030
from His birth, that He was born in a very
humble family,

88
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:43,350
very poor family, in very adverse
conditions.

89
00:24:43,375 --> 00:24:50,141
The reason was to show that all these
outward things

90
00:24:50,166 --> 00:24:56,370
and all these outward glories do not
make you great.

91
00:24:56,395 --> 00:25:01,703
The greatness is within, and when
that greatness is there

92
00:25:01,728 --> 00:25:08,643
then you don’t care for anything, because
you are so much enriched within yourself

93
00:25:08,668 --> 00:25:15,406
that you don’t bother about other things,
you don’t think about these things,

94
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:20,528
and you live in your own majestic life.

95
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:26,609
This is what we see in His life, He was
a very majestic person.

96
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:31,963
Otherwise if you meet somebody
who is a poor man, say,

97
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:40,026
and who has felt the poverty, he’ll talk
to you with a beggarish style.

98
00:25:40,051 --> 00:25:45,613
If there’s somebody who is born in a rich
family, he will talk to you

99
00:25:45,638 --> 00:25:54,213
in a very, I should say, outward, outwardly
showing-off nature.

100
00:25:54,238 --> 00:26:01,262
But a person who is a divine person,
all these things don’t touch.

101
00:26:01,287 --> 00:26:08,034
For him riches or not riches, positions
or no power

102
00:26:08,059 --> 00:26:12,540
is all just the same; and when that
happens,

103
00:26:12,565 --> 00:26:18,207
then you should consider that you have
become sahaja yogis.

104
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:24,215
I’ve seen people who come to Ganapatipule
- now they are very much changed.

105
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,275
Otherwise in the beginning they used
to say, “We don’t have water,

106
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:36,782
we don’t have this facility, it’s very cold
or hot” - whatever it is.

107
00:26:36,807 --> 00:26:42,236
They were all the time talking as if they
are on a holiday.

108
00:26:42,261 --> 00:26:45,930
It is something very different.

109
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:51,400
You are here to develop your witness state.

110
00:26:51,425 --> 00:26:55,573
Did you see the sky, how beautiful it was,

111
00:26:55,598 --> 00:27:00,724
how orange, blue, all kinds of colors
were there.

112
00:27:00,749 --> 00:27:09,681
The color it takes automatically,
and is enjoying it. It is not bothered

113
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:15,307
that it should remain forever, that this
will go away when there is darkness.

114
00:27:15,332 --> 00:27:20,425
Just watching, the sky is just watching.

115
00:27:20,450 --> 00:27:29,079
Whatever comes its way, it takes it. So
it’s so beautiful and it’s so joy-giving.

116
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:40,717
So the another thing is that when you
are in that state of spirituality,

117
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:46,440
then you are joy-giving, you are
peace-giving,

118
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:51,788
you are compassionate, and you love
each other.

119
00:27:51,813 --> 00:27:57,407
All these problems of the ego just
disappear.

120
00:27:57,432 --> 00:28:01,832
Ego is your greatest enemy, I think,

121
00:28:01,857 --> 00:28:11,661
and it is the one that really hinders
all the wealth and beauty of your life.

122
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:20,747
So if you could just see this ego, how it
works, just you’ll be enjoying it.

123
00:28:20,772 --> 00:28:24,985
It’s a drama it plays - all right,
let’s have it!

124
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:29,538
You can see the drama and then suddenly
you will be amazed

125
00:28:29,563 --> 00:28:33,403
that you are not in it, you are
watching it.

126
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:42,246
When you are detached from your ego,
you can see how it tries to entice you.

127
00:28:42,678 --> 00:28:48,722
These are the problems of today, and
that’s why we need Jesus very much.

128
00:28:48,747 --> 00:28:54,383
The problem of today is that people
don’t understand

129
00:28:54,408 --> 00:29:00,155
that how much harm they are doing
to themselves, to others,

130
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:05,610
and to the whole world by becoming
egoistical.

131
00:29:05,635 --> 00:29:10,591
If they could understand, I tell you,
they would give up.

132
00:29:10,616 --> 00:29:18,354
But the problem is they enjoy their hatred
 they enjoy that kind of meanness

133
00:29:18,379 --> 00:29:24,541
or I would say, very low-level living.
While you are all sahaja yogis,

134
00:29:24,566 --> 00:29:31,216
and what you have to do is to understand,
“Why this ego is coming in my head?

135
00:29:31,241 --> 00:29:33,837
What have I done? Who am I?”

136
00:29:33,862 --> 00:29:39,746
Once you go on asking such questions
 this ego will disappear.

137
00:29:39,771 --> 00:29:45,726
And it’s a big problem for Me also to deal
with people who have ego,

138
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:50,705
because I can’t tell them “You have got
ego.” If I tell them, they’ll all run away.

139
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:55,263
If I tell them, “All right, you are very
good, you are very nice,”

140
00:29:55,288 --> 00:30:01,536
then ego will be bloated. Then they’ll say,
“Oh, Mother told us I’m very nice.”

141
00:30:01,561 --> 00:30:07,933
It’s very problematic. I don’t know how
to deal with the ego of human beings.

142
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:12,176
I know they have, but I don’t know how
to deal with it.

143
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:17,997
I think it’s only you can deal with it, if
you will understand what’s wrong with you.

144
00:30:18,022 --> 00:30:24,304
That’s a very good way of solving your
problem, and My problem also.

145
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:27,782
My vision is too great, I think,
for one life.

146
00:30:27,807 --> 00:30:32,454
I want a global realization, I want people
all over the world

147
00:30:32,479 --> 00:30:38,560
to have realization. It’s very
remarkable how ....

148
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:09,457
In Sahaj culture we have a proper training
for getting rid of ego.

149
00:31:09,482 --> 00:31:17,602
You can yourself introspect yourself.

150
00:31:18,079 --> 00:31:25,498
You can yourself see why you behave
like this.

151
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:32,085
The introspection that sahaja yogis can
do cannot be done by other people,

152
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:37,170
because they can enter into themselves,
they can see for themselves,

153
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:44,761
they can watch others. And with that
they can just try to see

154
00:31:44,786 --> 00:31:50,543
what is this Mr Ego doing within
your head.

155
00:31:50,757 --> 00:31:56,181
Of course, we know that the mantra
of Christ is the best

156
00:31:56,206 --> 00:32:02,951
for removing all egoistical problems,
and that helps a lot.

157
00:32:02,976 --> 00:32:07,911
But also when you are doing this mantra,
you should be yourself

158
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,923
in a very humble state. “What am I,
after all, who am I?

159
00:32:14,948 --> 00:32:21,880
Look at so many stars, look at so many
beautiful things, and who am I?

160
00:32:21,905 --> 00:32:26,599
What have I done? Why should I be
so egoistical?

161
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:29,689
Why should I think I’m something great?”

162
00:32:29,714 --> 00:32:35,618
And also other people pamper you, because
they want to take advantage of you.

163
00:32:35,643 --> 00:32:39,984
So they’ll pamper you, they’ll say “This is
very great, you are very great”;

164
00:32:40,009 --> 00:32:44,478
and you just get enamored, get lost.

165
00:32:44,503 --> 00:32:52,122
You are like thrown into the torrential
rain

166
00:32:52,147 --> 00:33:00,328
and you flood out into big, I think, like
a big stream of egoistical people.

167
00:33:00,353 --> 00:33:05,346
And if you see around today in these
modern times,

168
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:12,008
everybody is quite conscious of their ego,
very conscious,

169
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:16,454
and the way they are coming up
in the newspapers

170
00:33:16,479 --> 00:33:21,853
or the way they are in some magazines,
I’m quite amazed.

171
00:33:21,878 --> 00:33:26,908
I would feel shy to be there, because
it’s so much

172
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:35,355
of expression of your ego, nothing else.
All kinds of things they start,

173
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,955
they have competitions of ego,
lots of competitions.

174
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:45,267
Like they have a beauty competition, then
they have another competition

175
00:33:45,292 --> 00:33:52,048
for Mister, you can say India, Mister this
thing, that.

176
00:33:52,073 --> 00:33:57,703
All these things actually give the person
ego,

177
00:33:57,728 --> 00:34:02,117
and others also run after such
competitions.

178
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:05,488
They think, “Why am I not? I should be
like that.”

179
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:10,449
So it’s very deadening and absolutely
blinds your mind,

180
00:34:10,474 --> 00:34:16,166
that you think this is the way one has
to be very successful.

181
00:34:16,191 --> 00:34:21,877
This success lasts for how long?
It perishes in no time.

182
00:34:21,902 --> 00:34:27,379
But success in Sahaja Yoga is what will
last forever,

183
00:34:27,404 --> 00:34:31,832
and everybody will remember it.

184
00:34:31,857 --> 00:34:38,422
The one who has this kind of a humble
nature

185
00:34:38,447 --> 00:34:42,735
will be remembered for generations.

186
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:51,358
I’ve never seen a statue of a person
who has been egoistical.

187
00:34:51,383 --> 00:34:55,198
On the contrary, if there was some
they used to criticize,

188
00:34:55,223 --> 00:35:00,540
“He was a very egoistical man.”
And nowadays it’s impossible,

189
00:35:00,565 --> 00:35:03,930
anybody who has ego, I don’t think
anybody

190
00:35:03,955 --> 00:35:07,727
is going to sing any songs about
such a person

191
00:35:07,752 --> 00:35:11,650
or going to raise any statues in their
name.

192
00:35:11,675 --> 00:35:17,587
So in the heart of hearts we like humble
people,

193
00:35:17,612 --> 00:35:23,970
and if we want others to like us, we should
be also very humble.

194
00:35:23,995 --> 00:35:28,233
Not artificially, but really,
by understanding

195
00:35:28,258 --> 00:35:30,940
that: “What are we? Why should we
proud,

196
00:35:30,965 --> 00:35:37,077
why should we try to overpower others
and trouble others?”.

197
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:41,461
If you understand that, you have done
full justification

198
00:35:41,486 --> 00:35:45,933
to the incarnation of Jesus Christ
the great.

199
00:35:45,958 --> 00:35:51,429
And there are so many qualities He has
shown. But the, for us the best is

200
00:35:51,454 --> 00:35:59,958
His passing through the ego sacrificing
His life is the greatest message,

201
00:35:59,983 --> 00:36:02,949
and for that we have to understand.

202
00:36:02,974 --> 00:36:07,981
But those who call themselves are
the most egoistical. I was surprised

203
00:36:08,006 --> 00:36:12,417
that England, English people are
extremely egoistical.

204
00:36:12,442 --> 00:36:17,801
Or otherwise other countries also I’ve seen
in the West, they are very egoistical.

205
00:36:17,826 --> 00:36:21,391
They’ve no humility at all, compared
to Indians,

206
00:36:21,416 --> 00:36:27,065
they are very, very egoistical people.
Why? Because they are following Christ,

207
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:31,401
can you imagine! Is this the way
we follow Christ?

208
00:36:31,426 --> 00:36:36,299
Those who call themselves Christians
and those who call themselves

209
00:36:36,324 --> 00:36:40,486
very great admirers of Christ should
show in their life

210
00:36:40,511 --> 00:36:46,744
that humility, that compassion, that love.
It is not so.

211
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:51,092
So specially for people who are from
Western countries,

212
00:36:51,117 --> 00:36:54,140
you must try to learn Sahaj culture.

213
00:36:54,165 --> 00:36:58,810
In the Sahaj culture, how do we talk,
how do we live,

214
00:36:58,835 --> 00:37:05,569
how do we contact, is something very
different. And then once you start

215
00:37:05,594 --> 00:37:12,010
Sahaj culture in your life, you’ll be
amazed, others will be amazed

216
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:16,457
how you are having a rapport
with each other,

217
00:37:16,482 --> 00:37:21,686
how you are looking after everything
so well.

218
00:37:21,711 --> 00:37:26,105
This is the best way to live in this world
as sahaja yogis,

219
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:30,665
where there is no ego, there is
no conditioning, nothing.

220
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:38,958
You are just absolutely free from all
these horrible attributes.

221
00:37:38,983 --> 00:37:46,210
And then you will be amazed how people
will trust you, how they will like you.

222
00:37:46,653 --> 00:37:51,605
I wish you all a very Happy Christmas.

223
00:37:59,183 --> 00:38:03,820
And also remember the message of Christ
and His life.

224
00:38:03,845 --> 00:38:05,859
May God bless you.
