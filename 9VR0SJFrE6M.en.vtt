WEBVTT

10:27.820 --> 10:33.640
Today it’s a great day for us, for all

10:34.820 --> 10:41.160
the Sahaja Yogis, that on this day I would
say, we are late by one day, or two days,

10:53.760 --> 11:00.760
the Sahastrara was opened out. It was just
a miracle, I should say, because I did not

11:14.970 --> 11:21.970
think that I am at a point where it could
be done. So, I wanted to wait, but some things

11:36.180 --> 11:43.180
happened that made Me think that it has to
be opened. It was
in such a situation that I felt that if I

12:04.080 --> 12:11.080
delayed anymore now, it may help these false
gurus to spread their nonsense all over. This

12:25.790 --> 12:31.510
just is, I should say, a Sahaj way of doing
things.

12:31.510 --> 12:38.510
Now, 25 years have passed, you have all gathered
here during this time, and we have so many

12:42.980 --> 12:49.980
others who are not here, who have achieved
so many things. But perhaps we are not aware

12:55.420 --> 13:02.420
as to what we have achieved, in the real sense
of the word. You’ve got your vibrations,

13:05.180 --> 13:12.180
you can feel this all-pervading power, you
are, as they say, swimming in the Ocean of

13:15.550 --> 13:22.550
Joy, you are all enjoying the collectivity,
and that you have transcended many of your

13:27.780 --> 13:34.780
limitations. All this has happened to you
because it is your right to have it. I don’t

13:38.940 --> 13:45.940
take any credit for it, only thing, all the
time I have been pointing it out to you, one

13:49.540 --> 13:56.540
thing, that now, you have entered into the
Kingdom of God, and enjoy yourself.

13:59.990 --> 14:06.990
We have to see around ourselves the whole
nature enjoys itself, it doesn’t bother,

14:09.590 --> 14:16.590
doesn’t bother about anything. They haven’t
got Realisation, they haven’t felt the Paramchaitanya,

14:18.300 --> 14:25.300
but how is it they know that we have to enjoy?
The flowers that come out for a short time

14:29.350 --> 14:36.090
and fade out – but as long as they live
they are very happy. They don’t think of

14:36.090 --> 14:43.090
their past or of their future; but they enjoy
the present – and in the present they enjoy

14:44.210 --> 14:51.210
– what is that – they are fragrant and
giving fragrance to others. They are beautiful

14:52.450 --> 14:59.450
and they are soothing others, the whole nature
is like that. If you look at the birds, or

15:01.930 --> 15:08.930
anything that we call as natural, is all sort
of in a meditative mood, all these hills and

15:15.070 --> 15:22.070
big, big mountains. They look as if they are
witness to whatever has been happening.

15:24.520 --> 15:31.520
Now, we have to really first look back what
we have achieved. That is important, because

15:36.620 --> 15:43.620
if you are climbing up on a hill, if you look
back, you get a shock, and you may fall down.

15:46.900 --> 15:53.900
So, normally people say never look back. But,
a person who has earned some treasure, he

15:57.600 --> 16:04.600
again and again goes and counts it and finds
out how much he has got, and every time he

16:06.920 --> 16:13.920
sees that he enjoys. So, to know relatively
what we have got, and how we have achieved

16:17.270 --> 16:24.270
something, will definitely give you greater
strength of mind and richness of life.

16:29.630 --> 16:36.520
The first thing that has happened to you,
I would say, which is very important, is this:

16:36.520 --> 16:43.520
that you have felt this all-pervading power.
That shows that you must have been great seekers

16:46.380 --> 16:53.380
of Truth, honest, sincere, sensible, that
just coming to My programme you felt the vibrations,

17:00.180 --> 17:07.180
and after that you started settling down into
it. So many of you have felt it, suddenly,

17:11.529 --> 17:18.209
and they were amazed, and they were shocked
and surprised, and they wanted to test whether

17:18.209 --> 17:25.209
it is true or not. But then you were confident,
you found it, that you’ve got definitely

17:28.899 --> 17:35.899
a new dimension in your life, and that you
are feeling this all-pervading power of Divine

17:38.820 --> 17:45.820
Love. I’ll take one lecture, sufficient
to describe this all-pervading power.

17:47.249 --> 17:54.249
But what you’ve got out of it is the essence
of it, one has to know, is a complete freedom,

17:56.649 --> 18:03.649
you have achieved your complete freedom. First
of all, the freedom has come to you; first

18:04.980 --> 18:11.980
of all, most important – is from your Ego,
this wall of Ego you have crossed. You have

18:16.259 --> 18:23.259
got out of the bondage of this Ego, which
was really so much, full of problems for you.

18:30.860 --> 18:37.860
So many things this Ego does of which you
are not aware. Firstly, a person who is an

18:39.970 --> 18:46.970
egoist doesn’t mind hurting anyone. He hurts,
but if he’s hurt he doesn’t like it, immediately

18:50.090 --> 18:56.789
he’ll start crying. Especially, I have seen
people who have too much Ego are very easily

18:56.789 --> 19:03.789
hurt, but they don’t understand how many
people they have hurt already, and how many

19:06.139 --> 19:11.460
are really frightened of such a person.

19:11.460 --> 19:18.460
So, you got rid of your Ego. It is sinful
to hurt any other human being, for anything,

19:21.619 --> 19:28.619
for whatever may be the reason, that you feel
you should hurt another one. The first is

19:28.740 --> 19:35.740
the revenge, the idea of revenge is there,
that I must take a revenge on the person who

19:36.509 --> 19:43.509
has hurt me, or has done some wrong to me,
or something of that kind. This idea of revenge

19:47.559 --> 19:54.559
comes when you react. Some people react very
violently. I have seen some people murdering

19:54.740 --> 20:01.740
each other in the name of revenge, killing
their own kith and kin, killing their fellow

20:01.840 --> 20:08.840
men, their countrymen. All over the world
is some sort of a stupid idea of revenge;

20:11.940 --> 20:18.940
but if you go to the subtle side of revenge,
what is it? What revenge have you taken? Supposing

20:22.950 --> 20:29.659
there is somebody who has troubled you, you
are angry with that person, and you have killed

20:29.659 --> 20:34.840
that person; so you have actually saved him!
He won’t have to suffer from guilty conscience,

20:34.840 --> 20:41.840
he won’t have to do anything, he’s just
finished. What is the revenge is? The revenge

20:42.480 --> 20:49.480
should be only by which a person gets out
of his idea of killing others. Like a sword

20:52.799 --> 20:59.799
never fights a sword, it fights the shield.
In the same way, the revenge that we think

21:05.100 --> 21:12.100
we can take on another person is not a revenge,
because any action you take in the name of

21:13.590 --> 21:20.590
revenge comes back to you and hurts you much
more. So many things can happen if a person,

21:23.470 --> 21:25.509
in the name of revenge, starts acting.

21:25.509 --> 21:30.909
Now, for example, these days, you know, in
the whole world there’s so much of revenge

21:30.909 --> 21:37.909
going on. Even in the name of God, taking
revenge because certain people are following

21:40.580 --> 21:47.320
some religion, or they are doing something
else that you aren’t doing. Working out

21:47.320 --> 21:54.239
this kind of a revenge – what is happening
is that you are just killing people, destroying

21:54.239 --> 22:01.239
them, who do not even understand what sort
of a revenge you are taking. People are putting

22:01.460 --> 22:08.230
bombs and putting all kinds of things, and
by that thousands of innocent people, one

22:08.230 --> 22:15.230
is killing. So what kind of a revenge have
you taken? They don’t deserve any revenge.

22:15.860 --> 22:22.860
So this revenge, when it explodes, can destroy
so many innocent people, and it will definitely

22:23.049 --> 22:30.049
react on you. You cannot get away with it,
it’s a very long process of this revenge.

22:35.480 --> 22:42.480
I have told you about Bermuda Triangle, what
they say, that so many blacks were taken slaves

22:45.669 --> 22:52.669
and were drowned in that area, so their spirits,
they are saying, are haunting on the people

22:53.100 --> 22:59.799
who are passing by, mostly the whites, and
they just drowned them. So it’s a very long

22:59.799 --> 23:06.360
process, and all that I need not discuss at
this auspicious occasion, but I have to say

23:06.360 --> 23:13.360
that when we take a revenge, every action
has a reaction. So somehow you have got out

23:14.860 --> 23:20.840
of that idea of revenge – just out of that
idea.

23:20.840 --> 23:27.840
There is another thing, that if you don’t
take revenge, and leave it to God, it acts.

23:29.519 --> 23:36.519
It acts, not only that, but the Divine power
takes into its own control how to really give

23:41.009 --> 23:48.009
a good lesson to that person, or to that community,
or to that kind of organisation which is taking

23:50.269 --> 23:57.269
a revenge on you. You don’t have to worry.
I’ll have to tell you that in these 25 years

24:00.090 --> 24:07.090
I have seen, people have been extremely unkind
to me. Many organisations, many so-called

24:08.259 --> 24:14.679
“religions”, all kinds of things, have
been after us, media has been after us. Take

24:14.679 --> 24:21.679
the example of French media, they tried to
trouble us so much, and tried to bring a bad

24:24.039 --> 24:31.039
name to us, doesn’t matter. The media people,
now three of them who went to India, are now

24:32.220 --> 24:39.220
under warrant, and if they go to India they
will be arrested. I didn’t do anything,

24:39.739 --> 24:46.739
we didn’t do anything. Secondly, the same
media, I mean the same newspapers, are all

24:50.559 --> 24:55.429
bankrupt. You didn’t do anything about it,
you didn’t go and say that they should become

24:55.429 --> 25:01.429
bankrupt, you didn’t take any revenge. Why
should we? Why should we take any revenge?

25:01.429 --> 25:08.429
Because we are not bothered as to what happens,
we are not bothered as to what these people

25:08.989 --> 25:15.989
have done to us. But legally they are now
involved in such a way that they are under

25:16.669 --> 25:23.669
warrant, and if they go to India, they will
be arrested, and the whole of French government

25:24.080 --> 25:31.080
is with them, all of them are trying so much,
but this punishment is on their head. In their

25:34.720 --> 25:40.080
lifetime – they didn’t have to die or
anything – in their lifetime they have got

25:40.080 --> 25:40.720
it.

25:40.720 --> 25:47.720
So you have got this special power that you
do not have to take revenge, or you have to

25:48.619 --> 25:55.619
just forgive, just forgive, and the forgiveness
will look after the whole arrangement of how

25:57.749 --> 26:04.609
to bring the other person to his proper path.

26:04.609 --> 26:11.609
So, once you are out of this idea of revenge,
you really feel very peaceful, extremely peaceful.

26:14.919 --> 26:21.840
Because this peace that you have within yourself,
is not unnatural, it’s not mental, but it

26:21.840 --> 26:26.960
just happens to you. “It’s alright, so
what”, if they have said, if they have done

26:26.960 --> 26:33.609
anything wrong to us, why should we bother.
So many things are there, which I can tell

26:33.609 --> 26:36.429
you, which have worked out automatically.

26:36.429 --> 26:43.429
Now, in Turkey, they have told me that there
is some boy who is from England, and he went

26:46.480 --> 26:53.039
and told the media something against Sahaja
Yoga, and it was all published, but in the

26:53.039 --> 26:59.840
court he confessed that “whatever I said
was wrong”. Nobody, went and told him, nobody

26:59.840 --> 27:05.609
threatened him, nothing happened. So, from
your point of view you must understand, that

27:05.609 --> 27:12.609
you are not going to get into any mess of
taking revenge of any kind, because you belong

27:14.269 --> 27:21.269
to the government of God, and this government
is extremely alert, very genuine, and also

27:24.999 --> 27:31.999
extremely efficient. As far as you are concerned,
you are a citizen of that great Kingdom. So

27:35.330 --> 27:41.519
what you have achieved is the citizenship
of this great Kingdom of God, where you should

27:41.519 --> 27:48.519
feel absolutely secured. The man who is secure
is never afraid, never afraid.

27:51.049 --> 27:58.049
So, you have also got rid of your fear. Man
is in the – I don’t know why he is afraid

28:00.090 --> 28:07.090
of this and afraid of that, and worries about
this and worries about that. It is something

28:07.169 --> 28:14.169
surprising how they worry about their health,
worry about their family, their children,

28:14.489 --> 28:21.489
their house, I mean, all sorts of things.
But Sahaja Yogis don’t, they don’t, we

28:23.859 --> 28:30.859
have no worry, it all works out. Why should
we worry? That instrument of worry is over,

28:32.019 --> 28:39.019
is finished I think, it’s gone out of order.
And what you are now, in a state where you

28:40.499 --> 28:47.499
just have no time to worry because you are
enjoying yourself. This fear I have seen in

28:49.899 --> 28:56.899
people works so much that so many diseases
people get out of fear, so many diseases.

29:00.179 --> 29:06.690
Especially most of these left-sided diseases
people get out of fear, what is there to fear?

29:06.690 --> 29:13.690
It’s like you beat the Mother Earth saying
that there’s a snake, there is no snake,

29:13.690 --> 29:20.359
but you may just feel that way and you may
go on with this fear. Anybody, any kind of

29:20.359 --> 29:27.359
an idea about a phantom or some sort of a
big devil standing somewhere. It is all nonsense,

29:32.999 --> 29:39.999
for you it doesn’t exist. Say in the darkness
you are walking, so you see forms and things,

29:40.009 --> 29:46.929
and some people say I saw one on a tree, some
sort of a form. It doesn’t exist actually,

29:46.929 --> 29:53.379
it doesn’t exist, but this fear in man makes
him think like that. He is afraid of this

29:53.379 --> 30:00.229
and afraid of that, and then, as a result,
he loses his freedom, he becomes a slave.

30:00.229 --> 30:07.080
Slave to so many people he is afraid of, that
such and such man will harm me, such and such

30:07.080 --> 30:14.080
man will trouble me. And the whole concept
of fear has ruined our family lives.

30:15.619 --> 30:22.619
For example, a wife is dominating, husband
is dominating, there’s nothing to fear,

30:23.999 --> 30:30.999
nothing to fear. By fear only you play into
their hands. So, supposing the wife is dominating,

30:31.799 --> 30:37.739
just make fun out of it, if you cannot make
the fun in the presence of say, your wife

30:37.739 --> 30:44.739
or your husband, better make it outside, thinking,
“Oh!, look at that!” It is your special

30:44.889 --> 30:51.889
quality now that you can really get rid of
your fear completely. What is there to be

30:54.039 --> 31:00.059
afraid of wife or afraid of husband? What
can he do to you? At the most he’ll kill

31:00.059 --> 31:05.229
you, so what, you are going to die in any
way.

31:05.229 --> 31:12.229
So, the fear of death is another nonsense
people have. First time when I started my

31:12.389 --> 31:19.389
work everywhere they asked me, “What about
death?” I said “but just now you are living,

31:19.619 --> 31:24.809
why are you asking,”what about death?””
So many people ask me the question, “what

31:24.809 --> 31:28.989
about our death”, why do you want to know
about it? I’ll tell you what about today,

31:28.989 --> 31:35.989
just now. So this is another mad idea that
we should know about our death, what is going

31:37.549 --> 31:42.299
to happen, and whatever happens. Once you
are dead you are finished, you don’t have

31:42.299 --> 31:48.690
to do anything after that, so what’s the
use of knowing when you will die, what will

31:48.690 --> 31:53.580
happen to you? Whatever has to happen will
happen. We never ask that “when I sleep

31:53.580 --> 31:58.149
what will happen to me?”- do we? And this
is a permanent sleep and we worry so much

31:58.149 --> 32:05.149
about it, that we should know what will happen
after death. One has to die at the time whenever

32:05.470 --> 32:12.470
it has to die, because whatever is born has
to be dead. But you do know that you have

32:14.169 --> 32:21.169
got eternal life. You can never die, death
is not this body disappearing. Death is where

32:28.299 --> 32:35.299
you are absolutely without any control of
your soul’s life. Once you are a realised

32:39.139 --> 32:46.139
soul you have all the control, all the powers
to take your soul wherever you feel like;

32:48.769 --> 32:54.059
to be born if you like, if you don’t want,
you will not be born. To be born with the

32:54.059 --> 33:01.059
people in the families, in the communities,
wherever you like. There are many great souls,

33:02.379 --> 33:09.379
I know that, have taken birth daringly into
societies which are very much, I should say,

33:10.489 --> 33:17.489
deteriorating and are in danger of getting
destroyed, because of stupidity they do. So

33:17.989 --> 33:24.989
this happening, that we are afraid of death,
is absolutely absurd for Sahaja Yogis. What

33:32.769 --> 33:39.769
is there to think, even about your death?
There is nothing like death for you because

33:40.919 --> 33:47.919
you have got eternal life. It’s not that
you continue with the same body, you may go

33:48.599 --> 33:54.419
on changing your dress, but you are living,
you are aware, and you know, even if this

33:54.419 --> 34:01.419
body is not there, you will be there all the
time available for Sahaja Yoga, for anything

34:02.710 --> 34:06.919
that is to be done in the name of reality.

34:06.919 --> 34:13.919
So, you must know your position as eternal
being, what is your work, what is your idea,

34:20.600 --> 34:27.600
what you have to do. So one has to get rid
of this idea of death because death doesn’t

34:30.480 --> 34:37.480
exist for you. It’s finished. Moreover,
all such people who are afraid of their death

34:38.780 --> 34:45.780
go on having insurances, this, that, all headaches,
you see. And ultimately, what happens? All

34:46.780 --> 34:53.780
these worldly things you leave here and you
depart. There is, I don’t think anybody,

34:56.150 --> 35:03.150
could carry even a little dust with that soul
which is departing. But in your case, when

35:07.840 --> 35:14.840
you people are no more on this Earth, so-called,
then you don’t carry all these material

35:14.890 --> 35:19.930
things because you have already given up.
You have no interest in them, you are not

35:19.930 --> 35:26.930
materialistic. So, your spirit is free, and
when you die, what happens to you is a very

35:30.470 --> 35:37.470
simple thing, that you feel very liberated,
absolutely, and then you feel your freedom,

35:39.230 --> 35:46.230
completely, and you can decide what you want
to do. It is all under your own guidance,

35:47.460 --> 35:54.460
your own desire, everything works out. You
don’t feel that you have come out of your

35:54.910 --> 36:01.820
body, and this is what should tell you that
there should be no fear of death. But, on

36:01.820 --> 36:08.820
the contrary, it should be welcomed, because
you will feel much more liberated, much more

36:11.970 --> 36:18.770
at ease. You don’t have other problems that
you have to, in any case, carry on in this

36:18.770 --> 36:25.590
world because of this body. Now see, “I
have to take some medicines, I have to take

36:25.590 --> 36:31.340
vitamins”, you don’t have to take anything,
you don’t need anything. This body is finished

36:31.340 --> 36:38.340
is a very good idea. It is so troublesome,
you see all the time, despite the fact you

36:40.510 --> 36:45.010
may say that “I don’t care for this body
and all that”, but this body won’t leave

36:45.010 --> 36:52.010
you. This is the most sticky thing we have,
is our body. So to forget about death should

36:58.580 --> 37:01.610
be the easiest thing for you.

37:01.610 --> 37:08.610
We have broken many walls, as you know very
well, that the conditionings that we had we

37:14.880 --> 37:21.880
have finished that, it is very surprising.
I have seen people, when they get their realisation,

37:22.830 --> 37:29.040
immediately after that they start seeing around
them. They’ll immediately tell you what

37:29.040 --> 37:35.030
is wrong with their religion, then they’ll
tell you what’s wrong with their country,

37:35.030 --> 37:40.450
what’s wrong with their culture. It’s
through them I have come to know so much.

37:40.450 --> 37:45.880
I didn’t know that this was so, but they
themselves told us. Now, for example there’s

37:45.880 --> 37:51.780
a Frenchman, take it. If a Frenchman gets
his realisation, I mean, you know everything

37:51.780 --> 37:58.090
about French,. The things you could never
even imagine what sort of people they are,

37:58.090 --> 38:04.630
they will tell you everything. Same with the
English, I’ve seen English, they may, they

38:04.630 --> 38:10.610
laugh at themselves alright, but actually
when they become realised souls, you see,

38:10.610 --> 38:16.360
they give you a complete picture of English
people, what sort of people are there, what

38:16.360 --> 38:22.300
is wrong with them, how they are egoistical,
this, that. I was amazed, I mean I never knew

38:22.300 --> 38:27.780
so many things, which I came to know through
Sahaja Yogis who got realisation. Because

38:27.780 --> 38:34.780
they have seen all these things very thoroughly
and very closely, and they knew what was it.

38:36.950 --> 38:43.950
Now when you become so clean, washed-up, your
mind completely cleaned out from all kinds

38:49.060 --> 38:56.060
of conditionings, you see, you become like
a mirror, a beautiful mirror, and in that

38:58.230 --> 39:05.150
mirror one can see a complete picture of the
society in which we live, the complete picture

39:05.150 --> 39:12.150
of the government which rules you, everything
so clear cut. And it is absolute, it is not

39:13.200 --> 39:19.470
biased. For example, you ask somebody then
he will say “what is your politics?” If

39:19.470 --> 39:23.400
I say “My politics is…I have no politics”,
he will say “What! you have no politics,

39:23.400 --> 39:30.400
how can you exist without politics?” “I
have no politics”. So they will go on asking

39:30.720 --> 39:37.720
questions to you which are very much unknown
but for a realised soul it is just the other

39:39.590 --> 39:46.590
way round. He not only sees, but also shows
and expresses very clearly. I have been amazed

39:51.770 --> 39:58.770
at the way people have been really so reflective
of the society into which they live, and the

40:02.710 --> 40:09.710
country which they represent. So the identification
is lost, complete identification is lost.

40:09.830 --> 40:14.410
You don’t feel identified much, you just
see what’s wrong with that person.

40:14.410 --> 40:21.410
Then another point is, you start seeing how
you can help, what you should do, how you

40:23.070 --> 40:30.070
can work it out. And the importance of that
becomes your main thing in life. Everybody,

40:30.770 --> 40:37.070
I see yesterday, the way you brought all these
flags and all that, behind that flag I could

40:37.070 --> 40:43.670
see all of you wanted that peace should prevail
in those countries, they should get all the

40:43.670 --> 40:50.670
joy and beauty of Sahaja Yoga. What a feeling
it is, it is not like yourself becoming Sahaja

40:51.600 --> 40:58.600
Yogis and sitting in the corner, no, they
want to do it for that country about which

40:59.320 --> 41:06.320
they are not identified, but without identification
they have that deep feeling that they have

41:07.590 --> 41:14.590
to work out, correct it. It is a very different
type of personality you develop. Normally,

41:14.680 --> 41:21.600
you see, if you say a word against somebody
that is in your country they do like this

41:21.600 --> 41:26.480
“Oh, what are you talking about, what about
your country!” Immediately, they will never

41:26.480 --> 41:33.480
accept. If you just try to say one word against
their country or their government, which might

41:37.320 --> 41:44.320
be the most rotten government, but no, still
“what? We are all right!” That kind of

41:46.500 --> 41:53.500
stupid identification which keeps you completely
glued to that society. Like some people will

41:54.960 --> 41:59.670
say, “no, I have to go to the pub”, I
said “why, why do you have to go to the

41:59.670 --> 42:04.240
pub?” “That’s our society, that’s
our culture. We have to go, we have to go

42:04.240 --> 42:11.240
to the pub, get drunk and fall down, all of
us together. That’s the sort of thing we

42:11.920 --> 42:17.110
are. We can’t help it, you see, this is
what it is”> You tell anybody, “why do

42:17.110 --> 42:23.090
you do like this? What is the need to do?”
“Well, because I have to live in this society,

42:23.090 --> 42:30.090
after all, after all I belong to this society,
and I just can’t do what I like”. But

42:30.820 --> 42:36.830
when you get your realisation you can do what
you like. You can do what you like because

42:36.830 --> 42:43.260
you only like that is righteous, that is good,
that is constructive, that is helpful. So

42:43.260 --> 42:49.080
you can do whatever you like after realisation,
there is no restriction for you. All these

42:49.080 --> 42:54.090
restrictions of “don’t, don’t, don’t
don’t”. These clearly enslave you, I think

42:54.090 --> 43:00.930
it very much enslaves you, but after realisation
you are such a free bird that nothing can

43:00.930 --> 43:01.860
enslave you.

43:01.860 --> 43:06.850
For example, there are many preachers who
preach that you should not drink and you should

43:06.850 --> 43:13.850
not smoke, you should not take drugs, you
should do this and do that, but it doesn’t

43:16.820 --> 43:22.450
stop, it doesn’t help, people struggle,
try everything, ultimately they commit suicides.

43:22.450 --> 43:28.340
But they cannot get rid of those habits, while
now you are so powerful that nothing can stick

43:28.340 --> 43:35.340
to you. That is the purity of your character
that has come up. It doesn’t allow any nonsensical

43:36.040 --> 43:37.580
things to stick to you.

43:37.580 --> 43:44.580
I have heard of so many Sahaja Yogis telling
me how their eyes have steadied down, how

43:45.150 --> 43:50.600
they have become so righteous, how they have
become so pure and they can’t understand.

43:50.600 --> 43:56.460
They said “Mother, is it Your power, Your
purity, You have given us? Or it is our purity

43:56.460 --> 44:02.370
You have awakened?” Of course yours, no
doubt, all these things you have and you become

44:02.370 --> 44:09.370
aware of it and thus you get absolutely misidentified,
I should say, with all these nonsensical things,

44:11.780 --> 44:18.780
and you don’t like it. You just don’t
like it, and you go on criticising. I have

44:19.200 --> 44:26.200
been to all these countries also before and
I have met people who are very much identified,

44:26.480 --> 44:32.770
and diplomatically I was not supposed to say
anything whatsoever that would make them feel

44:32.770 --> 44:39.740
that they are doing something wrong. But after
Sahaja Yoga the same people are telling us

44:39.740 --> 44:45.060
and making fun of the whole thing. For example,
I have heard some Sahaja Yogis talking to

44:45.060 --> 44:49.880
each other. He says “you see in my country
this is such a stupid thing going on”. Another

44:49.880 --> 44:56.880
one said, “nobody can beat mine, it is much
worse”. It is a very common competition

44:59.010 --> 45:06.010
among Sahaja Yogis going on. So then, we have
to see how pure we have become, and in this

45:17.760 --> 45:24.760
purity, anything that is dirty, murky, anything
that will spoil this purity, we don’t like

45:31.800 --> 45:38.800
it. We don’t like it. We are washed clean
from inside, and we won’t want to take anything

45:41.560 --> 45:44.040
like that within us anymore.

45:44.040 --> 45:51.040
Then I have seen also the way people have
become so compassionate. It is very surprising

45:55.540 --> 46:02.540
how they have become compassionate to each
other. For example, there were two Sahaja

46:03.170 --> 46:10.170
Yogis who were not very happy with each other,
not compatible, whatever you say that is.

46:10.980 --> 46:16.400
And I did not know ow to make them feel that,
you see, the other Sahaja Yogi is alright,

46:16.400 --> 46:20.800
it doesn’t matter after all, what is it.
“No, I don’t like this thing about him”,

46:20.800 --> 46:26.590
and the other would say “I don’t like
this thing about him”. So it went on “I

46:26.590 --> 46:31.960
don’t like”, he says “I don’t like”,
I mean they were seeing each other’s defects

46:31.960 --> 46:38.960
or whatever you may call them. So I said “alright,
now will you meditate for some time again,

46:42.590 --> 46:49.590
meditate, meditate”. And I said “now..do
you love Me?”. One says “I love You more

46:51.140 --> 46:58.140
that he loves”, I said “it is a difficult
situation, how to make them understand now

47:02.470 --> 47:09.470
that you cannot weigh your love, you cannot
make a chart out of it, it is something within

47:16.270 --> 47:23.270
yourself, and if you love somebody then you
enjoy it. I mean, you cannot qualify it, you

47:23.750 --> 47:30.750
cannot quantify it”. But this was going
on with these two gentlemen together, and

47:30.770 --> 47:37.280
I thought, now what to do? They are very important
and still there is no understanding between

47:37.280 --> 47:44.280
the two. So the Divine power took over, I
think. One of them fell very sick suddenly,

47:48.370 --> 47:55.370
very sick, and I had sent word also that “you’ll
be sick, be careful”, but they thought that

48:00.060 --> 48:07.000
the other fellow might be trying to be funny
or something. It was not understood, he was

48:07.000 --> 48:14.000
very sick. When he fell sick, the other one
felt such a tremendous love for him. It is

48:17.820 --> 48:24.820
something nobody can explain. That he went
and sat with that patient for 24 hours and

48:28.790 --> 48:35.790
said, “if you need any money, I have got”.
He paid wherever he could pay. So, this gentleman,

48:40.330 --> 48:47.330
who was a very sensible, reasonable person
on his own, felt this love, this affection

48:48.280 --> 48:55.280
in this hard task-master, the other one, and
such understanding grew up within them. It

48:57.550 --> 49:04.550
is, I think, the Divine’s play that they
were brought together so close, and such compassion.

49:06.960 --> 49:13.960
So the force of compassion within you is so
much, it is very subtle, you don’t see it,

49:14.590 --> 49:21.590
because on a mental level I was telling them,
arguing, trying to pacify him, pacify him,

49:23.130 --> 49:30.130
like that was on, it would not work out. But
when this force of compassion started acting,

49:33.690 --> 49:40.690
suddenly into one of them, another one saw
the compassion, the pure compassion, and just

49:46.670 --> 49:50.790
they became great friends.

49:50.790 --> 49:57.790
So one has to feel the compassion within yourself.
I have seen many a time that there are many

49:59.950 --> 50:06.950
Sahaja Yogis, and sometimes I have to correct
them or say something. Immediately another

50:10.240 --> 50:17.240
one will say, “Mother, can You forgive him?
You can’t forgive?” I say, “I’ve forgiven,

50:17.510 --> 50:24.510
I’m not saying anything”. “Please forgive,
please”, I feel so happy to hear that, that

50:26.440 --> 50:33.440
in one point, in one condition, when it comes
to a Sahaja Yogi, you support him, even against

50:37.660 --> 50:44.660
Me, I feel happy. Shows that you are not only
generous, but you are filled with your compassion.

50:48.540 --> 50:55.540
So, this source of compassion which is within
your being, in your heart, you just have to

50:58.300 --> 51:05.300
open your heart. If you open that heart it
is like opening the Sahastrara. You’ll be

51:07.190 --> 51:14.190
amazed how you can forgive people and how
you can live with them. I have reports which

51:14.240 --> 51:21.020
disturbs Me, many a time that people are forming
different groups and having different ashrams,

51:21.020 --> 51:27.480
and they don’t come to the collective and
all that. I feel very much concerned. Now

51:27.480 --> 51:33.480
what is missing is, of course there are also
some people who think that they must have

51:33.480 --> 51:39.260
a separate, their own organisation, and why
should they be in the collective and all that.

51:39.260 --> 51:46.260
So that it is definite that such a person
has not yet achieved that state of compassion.

51:52.850 --> 51:59.850
In the state of compassion you like that somebody
tells you that don’t say anything to such

52:04.000 --> 52:10.550
and such person, “I don’t want you to
say this”. It is very, very joy-giving to

52:10.550 --> 52:11.240
Me.

52:11.240 --> 52:18.240
Like, we had one couple who were quarrelling
throughout, they used to send Me letters after

52:18.380 --> 52:25.380
letters, I was fed up, telephones after telephones,
both of them quarrelling. Quarrelling so much,

52:26.960 --> 52:33.960
I did not know what to do with them. So, I
thought it is better that they divorce and

52:36.870 --> 52:43.870
finish it off, and I told them separately,
that “You better divorce each other and

52:47.670 --> 52:54.670
get out of it. But the complaints you have
are such that they cannot be solved”. She

52:56.470 --> 53:01.880
said “How?”. I said, “you are saying
that my husband does not give me more time,

53:01.880 --> 53:08.880
he is always out, and he doesn’t spend any
nice moments with me, we don’t go out, and

53:11.340 --> 53:16.640
all these complaints are there”. And the
husband says that “she always troubles me

53:16.640 --> 53:21.450
that I must take her out, and I must do this
and I must do that, I want to do it, but I

53:21.450 --> 53:27.510
can’t do”. So, I said but when you take
a divorce you’ll never claim anything. Permanently

53:27.510 --> 53:34.510
the husband is lost and you are lost, so why
do you want to do such a thing? Immediately

53:35.260 --> 53:42.260
this compassion started working, and then
I put in a word. “Supposing any one of you

53:43.100 --> 53:50.100
is sick tomorrow, then you will look after
each other?” This just put them out.

53:50.140 --> 53:57.140
You know such little, little moments in life
come in the lives of Sahaja Yogis I’ve seen,

53:57.950 --> 54:04.950
that suddenly this heart opens, and with that
they combat all this petty nonsensical ideas

54:07.880 --> 54:14.880
which keep them out from each other and out
of the collectivity. What gives Me the greatest

54:15.090 --> 54:22.090
enjoyment is to see how you love each other,
care for each other, joke with each other,

54:23.030 --> 54:29.870
and dance with each other. This is the greatest
thing that I enjoy. I don’t want to get

54:29.870 --> 54:36.870
rid of this idea of mine, despite the fact
many times it is hard to believe how Sahaja

54:38.440 --> 54:45.440
Yogis could behave like this and try to create
rifts and distances between the people who

54:49.550 --> 54:56.550
are realised souls. Because realised souls
anywhere in the world, if you see them, they

54:56.690 --> 55:03.690
respect each other, and not only respect,
care and never talk ill of another realised

55:05.800 --> 55:12.800
soul. Never, I don’t know if you have known
about the private lives of these saints, but

55:12.810 --> 55:19.230
in India as we have had so many of them, when
you see them, how they have behaved towards

55:19.230 --> 55:26.230
each other, the way they have looked after
each other, it is so beautiful, it is so noble,

55:31.670 --> 55:38.670
as if they care for the other Sahaja Yogi,
or yogi, or realized soul, more than for themselves.

55:40.490 --> 55:47.490
And the whole thing makes, you feel like in
a new world of new people who care for the

55:52.300 --> 55:59.300
feelings of others, and not what they want
to say or what they want to have, or they

56:00.500 --> 56:03.000
are something special.

56:03.000 --> 56:10.000
Also, in Sahaja Yoga you have lost your specialities.
Some of them think they are very special.

56:15.070 --> 56:22.070
Supposing I call some lady to put, say, some
altar on My Feet. She starts thinking she

56:24.570 --> 56:30.370
is very special, but I just call her because
I know she has a horrible Agya and I have

56:30.370 --> 56:37.370
to clear it out. And when somebody told Me,
“Mother, she thinks she is something very

56:39.870 --> 56:45.030
special”, I said “really, what makes her
think like that?” “Because You call her

56:45.030 --> 56:52.030
to put some altar on Your Feet”. I said,
“I just call her that she has such a horrid

56:52.030 --> 56:59.030
ugly Agya, that she will trouble everyone,
so I want to clear it”. So, either I should

57:01.310 --> 57:08.310
have told her that “you are a very egoistical,
horrible, and all the words that are possible,

57:10.350 --> 57:17.350
“otherwise she won’t understand. It is
so surprising. There is one lady who was really

57:19.370 --> 57:26.370
very nasty to her in-laws and everybody in
India, and she came to see Me. I actually

57:27.820 --> 57:32.920
scolded her, I said “what business you had
to behave like this here? Your father, who

57:32.920 --> 57:37.390
was such a racist – you never said a word
against him, now why are you talking so much

57:37.390 --> 57:42.360
against these people?” – I scolded her!
And she went out and told – “Oh, look

57:42.360 --> 57:48.130
at me – Mother has called me – nobody
is allowed to see Her” – I said, “What’s

57:48.130 --> 57:55.130
this?” It’s a very funny situation with
people – I sometimes feel. The way they

57:55.580 --> 58:00.490
think they are something special and they
should make themselves special, it is becoming

58:00.490 --> 58:07.490
really difficult. Now, just to show my love,
to appreciate something, people have, gone

58:11.470 --> 58:18.470
down !! – and if you give some present to
that person or you show concern about that

58:19.680 --> 58:25.720
person because he’s done some good work
or something, he starts thinking he’s something

58:25.720 --> 58:32.720
special. I mean, it is an impossible situation,
because I expect that if I have done anything

58:36.950 --> 58:43.950
good to that person, or in anyway suggested
my concern about a person, that person has

58:45.860 --> 58:52.860
to become a very good Sahaja Yogi, in the
sense – the most humble and honest and loving

58:54.450 --> 59:01.450
person, otherwise it has no meaning. No use
being good to anyone if that means that person

59:04.170 --> 59:11.170
jumps into hell. So, this one is also another
idea of speciality, that they have lost their

59:22.830 --> 59:24.520
sense of speciality.

59:24.520 --> 59:31.520
When a drop becomes the ocean, it has become
the ocean but it’s not the drop anymore.

59:34.160 --> 59:40.770
If anybody thinks I’m a special person then
know that you are no more an ocean, you are

59:40.770 --> 59:47.770
still the drop, because, unless and until
you are the drop, how can you feel that I’m

59:47.870 --> 59:54.870
something special. So, you have lost your
speciality, you have lost it because all these

59:57.600 --> 01:00:03.360
ideas of speciality comes from your past.

01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:10.360
One lady I met once, a long time back, she
was a very rude, loud, arrogant woman. So,

01:00:12.350 --> 01:00:19.350
this was in Delhi where people are very conscious
of their husband’s jobs and this and that.

01:00:20.110 --> 01:00:27.110
I didn’t even know the destination or even
the designation of my husband. So, she was

01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:37.200
very rude. I said, “What’s the matter
with you?, Why are you so rude?, What’s

01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:41.920
the problem?”. She said, “You don’t
know? – I’m the wife of such and such”.

01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:48.920
“You are the wife or the husband?”. “I
am the wife of such and such”!! So, she

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:00.680
asked me “What are you doing here?”, I
said “I am a housewife”. Then my husband

01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:12.000
came, she said “Do you know him?” I said,
“Yes, I know him – why?” I thought there

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:21.520
must be something wrong there also. So she
said “No, I just want to know”, “ah

01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:32.010
– How do you know him?” – Why? As if
I was some criminal or what!! I said “He’s

01:01:33.360 --> 01:01:40.360
my husband”, “Oh, my God, he’s your
husband!!” What happened? – as if 10 serpents

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:49.420
had bitten her. Maybe her husband was at a
much lower position than my husband, maybe,

01:01:51.490 --> 01:01:58.490
something which I am not conscious of it.
But this is what is “I am something special”.

01:02:03.830 --> 01:02:10.830
This stupid idea of being special has to be
completely negated in Sahaja Yoga. Not mentally,

01:02:13.070 --> 01:02:18.290
not mentally. Mentally if you are again saying
“I’m not special, I’m not special, like

01:02:18.290 --> 01:02:25.290
a mantra, you’ll become much more – because
you will say “I’ve said this mantra 23,000

01:02:35.850 --> 01:02:42.850
times – who can say like me. So this idea,
I’m something special, I’m something great,

01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:57.470
I’m something out of the blue, something
superior to others, just vanishes. Like as

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:09.780
I said, you are a drop in the sea. You have
become the ocean but you are no more a drop

01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:18.460
to have it a relative value system, there’s
no relative value system. There’s no system

01:03:18.460 --> 01:03:25.460
by which you can say that I’m higher or
he’s lower – all that has created all

01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:32.500
the problems of the world. See, from our cast
system in India, the social systems in the

01:03:34.090 --> 01:03:41.090
west, the racialism in the west, also self-consciousness
of – my religion is better, yours is worst,

01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:53.280
we are the best. All these things have created
problems. It has done no good, it has failed

01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:59.690
and failed and failed. So, in Sahaja Yoga,
at least don’t bring this disease anymore

01:03:59.690 --> 01:04:06.690
– that I’m better, our country’s better.
This speciality you should drop and the real

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:19.270
beauty of your personality reached. For that,
you don’t need a special skin, you don’t

01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:26.270
need a special body, you don’t need a special
– what you can call – a glamorous look.

01:04:27.530 --> 01:04:34.130
What you need is a beautiful heart ! And,
I tell you, it is the beautiful heart that

01:04:34.130 --> 01:04:41.130
attracts – nothing else. It’s the beautiful
heart that you want to have.

01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:48.210
I’ve known people, many like that. There
was one gentleman who divorced his first wife.

01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:56.430
She may be, not be so good looking, ugly or
whatever it was. Then he married another good

01:04:56.430 --> 01:05:03.430
looking woman and he ran away from the house.
So, I asked him “Why?” – you didn’t

01:05:04.850 --> 01:05:09.970
like that woman because she was ugly or whatever
it was – Why have you now been running away

01:05:09.970 --> 01:05:16.970
from this one?” “She has no heart – She
has no heart” . And – this is what you

01:05:20.360 --> 01:05:27.360
have – a very great, generous, beautiful,
dharmic, heart – you have got it – as

01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:37.280
a present from the Divine and which you must
respect. You should be proud of and enjoy

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:47.440
it – as you should enjoy your generosity,
you should enjoy the way all this nature is

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:59.590
enjoying itself. To be very meticulous about
things, to be all the time correcting others,

01:05:59.590 --> 01:06:06.590
it is a headache – it’s a headache. The
best thing is to correct yourself and laugh

01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:15.580
at yourself, that’s the best way you can
do it. Everybody has some funny things about

01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:22.580
themselves. I also have, I must admit, and
I enjoy them because I think I try and try

01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:31.500
but always I forget. For example, the spectacles
– I always forget them. Before coming – you

01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:37.080
see, I must always forget it – I tell Myself
that I need it – I should take it – I

01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:44.080
must remember – but invariably I forget.
I don’t know why – I mean, I can’t do

01:06:45.980 --> 01:06:51.740
without it, but still I forget. There’s
so many things – for example, I don’t

01:06:51.740 --> 01:06:55.590
know how to count money, if you may give me
a 100 rupees, I’ll count it 200 rupees.

01:06:55.590 --> 01:07:02.510
I tell you, I’m good at mathematics but
I can’t count. I don’t know how to sign

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:09.119
a check, can you believe it, I can’t sign
it. You have to write the check for me, otherwise

01:07:09.119 --> 01:07:16.119
I can’t. And, somebody asked me say, for
say 100 rupees – I’ll give him 500 – and

01:07:16.869 --> 01:07:21.020
forget about it and that person will say “Mother,
you gave me 500 – and I’ll say “No,

01:07:21.020 --> 01:07:25.500
no – I gave you 100 only – “No, you
gave me 500″. I went home and found out

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.030
– it’s alright – after all if he’s
dishonest, he’s dishonest, if he’s honest,

01:07:31.030 --> 01:07:37.630
his honest, so why to worry about how much
money you gave and this thing and that? Meticulously,

01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:42.960
you see, finding everything like this and
I’ve seen with all these meticulous people

01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:47.840
they always fail – because you see this
brain plays some tricks on them.

01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:54.840
For example, there was one fellow who told
me that the size of your car is such and such

01:07:54.849 --> 01:08:01.060
– alright then – So, the size of the garage
should be such and such, I said, “alright”.

01:08:01.060 --> 01:08:08.060
So, when he built the garage, the car won’t
get in. I said, such a meticulous architect

01:08:13.950 --> 01:08:20.950
and such a well-known person who has got so
many awards, this, that – how could he make

01:08:21.390 --> 01:08:28.390
such a mistake? I still didn’t understand
it – you see? He said, “Now, you better

01:08:30.190 --> 01:08:37.190
buy a smaller car”. I said, “at least
now you made this garage in a proper way,

01:08:37.529 --> 01:08:41.890
otherwise again if I buy something it won’t
enter in.

01:08:41.890 --> 01:08:47.500
So, you see, what I’m saying, we are so
particular, so meticulous. Now, see these

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:52.560
little, little flowers, I see them here, they
are not meticulous, they are growing on their

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:59.299
own – freely – everybody gets the suns
rays and they are quite happy. But the way

01:08:59.299 --> 01:09:04.910
we are particular – those people who are
very particular are headaches to themselves

01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:10.210
and then ultimately they find that it is not
so. You have lost that – you have lost that

01:09:10.210 --> 01:09:10.489
meticulousness.

01:09:10.489 --> 01:09:16.350
I know of a Sahaja Yogini – she was running
a shop and she said, “Mother, I knew each

01:09:16.350 --> 01:09:21.589
and everything, and I knew each and every
price and every thing I knew in the shop – but

01:09:21.589 --> 01:09:28.020
since I’ve got realisation I’ve forgotten
everything. “So, are you happy or unhappy?”.

01:09:28.020 --> 01:09:34.750
“I’m very happy”. “Why?” “Because,
now I’m making a big profit”. Profit is

01:09:34.750 --> 01:09:38.640
the main thing – why should you try to remember
each and every thing.

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:45.640
So, it is to be very meticulous to be very
systematic, where you see around there – no

01:09:47.339 --> 01:09:54.339
tree is systematic – it is unsystematically
systematic. Some leaves are this side, some

01:09:55.170 --> 01:10:00.650
are that side, some branches are on that side
– there’s no system, because then you

01:10:00.650 --> 01:10:07.650
become a military – if you form a system.
So, in Sahaja Yoga, there is no system. We

01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:15.160
are beyond time, we are beyond all kinds of
systems, we have no systems. All our system

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:24.210
is what is the unison within ourselves. Like
these two hands, they have no system built

01:10:24.210 --> 01:10:31.210
in, nothing, but they move, especially telling
you if you want. Both the hands move like

01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:39.000
that, all the time like anything and I don’t
know what it means but they all do the same

01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:44.640
thing. But, there’s no system built in – nobody
said to them that, do these gestures and all

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:51.430
that but they do it and they do it naturally,
all of them together – without any system.

01:10:51.430 --> 01:10:58.430
So to build up mental systems is wrong and
against Sahaja Yoga. Some people have written

01:10:59.720 --> 01:11:05.510
to me “Mother, we want to translate your
transcriptions – that, do this, do that,

01:11:05.510 --> 01:11:11.790
and plans – I said, “forget it, forget
it”. Because, if you start planning, you

01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:18.790
see, you will definitely, definitely fall
into the trap of systems. You’ll have to

01:11:20.170 --> 01:11:24.920
follow systems – this system is good, that
system is good, why not have this way and

01:11:24.920 --> 01:11:30.700
because, I don’t mean, I don’t say that
is wrong because you have been used to systems.

01:11:30.700 --> 01:11:37.700
Especially in the West people are over systematic,
over systematic. In everything, like they’ll

01:11:40.090 --> 01:11:47.090
have courses, you see, built up – then the
spoons, then the forks, then how to move and

01:11:47.790 --> 01:11:54.790
what to eat and how to eat – I mean, it
is too much. If you have to eat food it is

01:11:55.220 --> 01:12:02.050
straight forward – you can eat it with your
hands, there’s no system needed. For all

01:12:02.050 --> 01:12:08.360
these systems, anorms – are too much in
the West and you should really try to cut

01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:14.489
them down. As a result, they had anti-culture
and all that nonsense, another kind of stupidity

01:12:14.489 --> 01:12:21.489
where they were building up another kind of
a system. You see, then they said – “We

01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:28.360
are hippies now – alright – so they must
have hair never washed, never clean with lice

01:12:28.360 --> 01:12:35.360
in their heads and it must be all – like,
you can say – the “shankara” style.

01:12:36.580 --> 01:12:43.580
So, all of them have to have that – again
a system. There’s no variety, one hippie

01:12:45.100 --> 01:12:49.000
means, another is the same – you cannot
make them out one from another. If somebody

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:56.000
puts a ring here, everybody will put it, if
he puts a ring here, then everybody will put

01:12:57.130 --> 01:13:02.690
it. Without any brains, without any understanding
and they talk of individuality – a personality,

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:09.690
where is the individuality. Because you take
to anything that your gang – you can call

01:13:14.110 --> 01:13:20.330
– or you can call the crowds – they are
taking to, very fashionable. In India, if

01:13:20.330 --> 01:13:27.330
you say it is very fashionable, it means it
is very expensive and very beautiful and I

01:13:31.150 --> 01:13:38.150
mean it’s a very elite, elite word. But
when it’s very fashionable, means everybody

01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:45.400
likes it. It could be a punky thing or anything
– it’s fashionable – it’s the fashion.

01:13:46.390 --> 01:13:53.390
Means you do not have your own idea – your
own personality, your own individuality. In

01:13:53.920 --> 01:14:00.920
Sahaja Yoga you are not bound to any fashion,
no fashion. If you like, wear this, wear that

01:14:05.730 --> 01:14:11.280
– whatever you like. You are free to do
what you like. You can wear whatever you like

01:14:11.280 --> 01:14:17.880
but as I said – again that you will govern
yourself, you will be your own Guru, you will

01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:24.670
be your own master and you will do whatever
is good, whatever is decent, whatever the

01:14:24.670 --> 01:14:31.400
deities will like. You’ll just do it that
way because now you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:38.270
So, the life becomes so much easier, so much
easier, you don’t worry about things which

01:14:38.270 --> 01:14:44.360
are not there and you are not also worried
about the things which are there, because

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:51.360
you think, now, you see something, alright,
I have got this nice one now, I must keep

01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:58.790
this one for somebody, I must give it to somebody.
So, I got a ring which was quite big. I was

01:14:58.900 --> 01:15:04.480
thinking whom should I give this, who has
got thick fingers. So I started looking at

01:15:04.480 --> 01:15:10.080
the fingers of everyone, you see, whosoever
has a thick finger, I ‘ll give him this

01:15:10.080 --> 01:15:15.430
one. I mean the thought was just the other
way round, supposing you are not a Sahaja

01:15:15.430 --> 01:15:18.300
Yogi, then you will say, “Oh Ma, such a
big thick finger – why don’t you take

01:15:18.300 --> 01:15:25.300
out some gold and use it, sell it off – or
else you see you can take out the stone from

01:15:27.020 --> 01:15:32.190
here. I mean all kinds of nonsensical things
you’ll think but you’ll not think that

01:15:32.190 --> 01:15:36.400
you better give it to somebody because you
can’t wear it, it’s too big for you. Why

01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:42.970
not give it to another? What’s wrong? After
all, it is not fitting you – so give it

01:15:42.970 --> 01:15:49.810
to another – but this is only possible in
Sahaja Yoga. I’ve seen people, very kind,

01:15:49.810 --> 01:15:56.810
very, very kind people who have been very
sweet to each other and exactly what the other

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:07.230
person wants they’ll buy and give it to
that person or may say, oh no, I have one

01:16:07.230 --> 01:16:14.230
I’ll give it to you – they do it like
that, all the time thinking of others – What

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:22.500
should I give? – What should I do? It’s
the expression of that joy, the compassion

01:16:23.020 --> 01:16:30.020
within you, you use your matter for that,
all the time, all the time.

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:37.060
Like somebody’s house was burgled in Canada.
So she writes to me – “Thank God, my house

01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:41.850
is cleaned out now, I didn’t know what to
do with it, with the junk”.

01:16:41.850 --> 01:16:47.020
So you see, this kind of an attitude comes
in, so that if you have to give to someone

01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:54.020
then give it to someone who is a Sahaja Yogi
to express your love. But normally, people

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:00.540
will do, with whatever, is the junk in the
house, whatever is rotten, finished you see,

01:17:00.540 --> 01:17:06.190
that they will give as a present. But when
you are a Sahaja Yogi, you want to give something

01:17:06.190 --> 01:17:13.190
really very special because your whole being
has become so beautiful. Just like a flower,

01:17:14.440 --> 01:17:21.080
I should say, which wants to give fragrance
to others all the time, the fragrance of your

01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:28.080
compassion and love, affection and security.
It’s a new age, what they would say, but

01:17:32.170 --> 01:17:39.170
I would say it’s a new human beings that
are before me and all this newness has so

01:17:41.460 --> 01:17:48.460
many beautiful (assets?), that they really
sparkle like diamonds – no doubt. My only

01:17:54.870 --> 01:18:01.870
blessings to you is that you grow and grow
in it and become greater and greater people.

01:18:05.020 --> 01:18:11.440
Never thinking that you are greater than others.
Never thinking that you are more special than

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:17.900
others, this will definitely soothe you down
completely. Somebody might have hurt you somewhere,

01:18:17.900 --> 01:18:23.610
doesn’t matter, somebody must have scolded
you – doesn’t matter. What is your capacity

01:18:23.610 --> 01:18:29.070
is to love another person and to be affectionate
and kind.

01:18:29.070 --> 01:18:36.070
I’m really amazed how these 25 years have
passed – with all kinds of stupid problems

01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:46.650
and nice things – such a mixture and all
those things have never disturbed me – I

01:18:48.010 --> 01:18:55.010
was never disturbed. I used to act sometimes,
that I’m angry or sometimes I used to say

01:18:55.030 --> 01:19:02.030
things which I should not have, normally said
because it was needed to be said. But, on

01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:09.900
the whole – like sitting in a very big ship
you can say – we all are elevated into the

01:19:14.870 --> 01:19:21.870
realm of Divine Love and this is what one
has to achieve. One person, if he has that

01:19:22.880 --> 01:19:29.880
love and compassion and that pure love then
that person can emit it to others and the

01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:39.660
rapport of this compassion is extremely beautiful
which cannot be described in words. Like yesterday,

01:19:41.420 --> 01:19:48.220
I couldn’t speak – with what words I could
put my feelings. I thought there are no words

01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:55.220
that are created on this earth to express
my deep feeling that how you people have taken

01:20:56.650 --> 01:21:03.650
to Sahaja Yoga so well and

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:55.000
have understood it.

02:32:39.310 --> 02:32:46.310
May God bless you.
