00:02:43.342 --> 00:02:51.029
Now we are facing little children.

00:02:51.276 --> 00:02:58.898
They are the ones who are incarnations.

00:03:00.687 --> 00:03:06.501
They are the ones who are going
to lead humanity

00:03:06.702 --> 00:03:15.661
into some great advancement –

00:03:15.862 --> 00:03:21.620
the humanity has to be looked after.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:27.994
They are tomorrow’s humanity.
And we are today’s.

00:03:28.195 --> 00:03:34.683
And what are we giving to them
for them to follow?

00:03:34.884 --> 00:03:39.881
What is their aim in life?

00:03:41.034 --> 00:03:44.660
Very, very difficult to say.

00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:53.483
But with the Sahaja Yoga they will
all go in the proper way,

00:03:53.684 --> 00:03:56.746
they’ll behave in a proper way

00:03:56.946 --> 00:04:05.597
and the whole thing will be a different
mass of Sahaja Yogis coming up.

00:04:05.798 --> 00:04:12.044
But it is the duty of bigger Sahaja Yogis
to look after them;

00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:17.554
to have better moral standards,
to have better lives

00:04:17.755 --> 00:04:27.510
so that they follow your life and become
genuinely good Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:27.711 --> 00:04:35.713
It’s a very big responsibility, perhaps
we don’t recognise it, we don’t understand,

00:04:35.914 --> 00:04:47.302
but all these are little creatures
which are after the image

00:04:47.503 --> 00:04:55.050
of great souls and they should be
brought up in that way,

00:04:55.251 --> 00:05:03.065
respected in that manner and loved
with great care.

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:11.046
This is to be understood. The problem
with our elderly people is this,

00:05:11.247 --> 00:05:16.944
that we do not consider them
to be considered,

00:05:17.174 --> 00:05:24.304
to be bothered about, to be understood
about. We think we are too intelligent,

00:05:24.505 --> 00:05:29.541
too good and we need not waste
our energy with them.

00:05:29.742 --> 00:05:33.441
This is the trouble of the elderly
people.

00:05:33.642 --> 00:05:41.101
But today when we are sitting here
to worship Shri Ganesha,

00:05:41.302 --> 00:05:45.583
we should know they are all incarnations
of Shri Ganesha

00:05:45.784 --> 00:05:54.474
and they should be given proper attention,
proper understanding about themselves.

00:05:54.675 --> 00:06:04.413
I find certain amount of children who are
very well-behaved, which are very sensible,

00:06:04.614 --> 00:06:10.501
and there are some who have no idea
as to what they are doing.

00:06:10.702 --> 00:06:16.907
So it is the duty of the elders to put
ideas into their head,

00:06:17.108 --> 00:06:22.939
to proper understanding about themselves
and the self-respect.

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:29.632
Same thing I would say for the elder
Sahaja Yogis

00:06:29.832 --> 00:06:34.551
who have to look after their younger
brothers and sisters.

00:06:34.751 --> 00:06:40.589
In this family of ours which we call
as Sahaja Yogis,

00:06:40.789 --> 00:06:47.084
there are all kinds of people, all types,
all behaviours.

00:06:47.284 --> 00:06:54.552
Of course, they should not be regimented,
there should not be uniformity,

00:06:54.753 --> 00:06:58.270
but in that variety there should be
with beauty,

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:05.999
there should be beautiful trend of being
one with each other.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:10.774
For that, what should we do,
is the problem.

00:07:10.975 --> 00:07:15.455
What should the elders do to achieve that?

00:07:15.655 --> 00:07:23.740
What is our solid contribution
to their lives?

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:35.731
The first will be to tell them who is
Shri Ganesha,

00:07:36.318 --> 00:07:44.110
and that what are the qualities of Ganesha,
what does He represent.

00:07:44.311 --> 00:07:50.076
What does He represent, what qualities
He has.

00:07:50.276 --> 00:07:56.314
And once they start understanding, that
though being a little boy,

00:07:56.515 --> 00:08:03.194
He’s so generous, He’s so kind,
He’s so forgiving,

00:08:03.395 --> 00:08:08.572
they’ll be amazed because they are
also small

00:08:08.773 --> 00:08:14.231
and they’ll also take to that kind of life.

00:08:14.432 --> 00:08:20.575
I find some children very sensible,
very good here.

00:08:20.775 --> 00:08:26.823
Some are naughty and some don’t understand
what we are doing here.

00:08:27.024 --> 00:08:31.526
Whatever it is, they are after all
children.

00:08:31.727 --> 00:08:38.037
And what you have to do is to look
after them, respect them,

00:08:38.237 --> 00:08:46.529
and give them the full idea about
Shri Ganesha.

00:08:46.768 --> 00:08:54.453
I think everybody must have a statue
of Shri Ganesha in your house,

00:08:54.653 --> 00:09:00.207
so the children will see it and ask,
“Who is He? What is He doing here?”

00:09:00.408 --> 00:09:04.427
And you’ll be amazed how they will
understand Him,

00:09:04.628 --> 00:09:10.270
how they will understand His qualities
and how they will work it out.

00:09:10.470 --> 00:09:17.752
It is important for all of you to have
at least one Shri Ganesha in your house,

00:09:17.953 --> 00:09:24.203
so that you can tell your children that,
‘You all have to become like Him’.

00:09:24.403 --> 00:09:28.913
Now what are the qualities of Shri Ganesha?

00:09:29.114 --> 00:09:33.263
They won’t understand chastity,
they are too small,

00:09:33.464 --> 00:09:36.929
they won’t understand all those qualities.

00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:46.718
But one quality they will understand
is to be honest. Is to be honest.

00:10:06.055 --> 00:10:14.923
Gradually you’ll find all difficult ones
will go down, it will work out that way.

00:10:15.124 --> 00:10:20.763
Because you see, they don’t understand
My lecture,

00:10:20.964 --> 00:10:23.996
they don’t understand what I am saying.

00:10:24.197 --> 00:10:31.933
But one thing is there, if there are some
oppositions within, they will show –

00:10:32.134 --> 00:10:38.218
show very well – because they are
so innocent and so simple,

00:10:38.419 --> 00:10:46.648
their innocence will help them to expose
them to reality.

00:10:47.617 --> 00:10:53.477
I hope you all look after your children,
guide them properly

00:10:53.678 --> 00:11:06.570
and take them to a level of understanding
that they understand what is their position,

00:11:06.771 --> 00:11:12.228
what qualities they should have,
why will they be respected.

00:11:12.429 --> 00:11:18.995
You’ll be amazed, that their behaviour
will change

00:11:19.196 --> 00:11:23.607
the behaviour of all the other children.

00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:31.812
What I have to say that nobody should think
that you are very grown-up

00:11:32.013 --> 00:11:37.223
because you can keep quiet, sit quietly
and all that, no.

00:11:37.424 --> 00:11:44.380
You are grown-up only if you can imbibe
the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

00:11:44.581 --> 00:11:51.331
I have seen people who are very grown-up
still do not have simple qualities

00:11:51.532 --> 00:11:56.702
of chastity, of honesty.

00:11:56.903 --> 00:12:04.035
They don’t have, and they can’t have,
because they don’t think it is important.

00:12:04.236 --> 00:12:12.767
So, I leave it to you to find out
Shri Ganesha within yourself.

00:12:16.036 --> 00:12:21.194
I enjoy their company because
they are so innocent

00:12:21.395 --> 00:12:29.935
and so simple-hearted and I like them
very, very much.

00:12:38.382 --> 00:12:46.402
So, you should not get afraid or frightened
of their mischief.

00:12:46.567 --> 00:12:52.243
On the contrary, you should know
they deserve much more love,

00:12:52.443 --> 00:12:59.339
much more understanding and much more
scope to grow.

00:12:59.540 --> 00:13:05.893
I hope by the time they will be of your age,
they’ll be great Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:06.093 --> 00:13:09.312
They’ll understand what we are doing here.

00:13:09.518 --> 00:13:16.899
I had to face mountains of nonsense
with the older people,

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:23.973
but these won’t have that. They’ll be
very simple, very sweet

00:13:24.174 --> 00:13:27.910
and they’ll understand love.

00:13:29.148 --> 00:13:33.524
So I would say we can allow these children
to go out and play

00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:39.786
and somebody can look after them,
so that you’ll be at peace.

00:13:44.935 --> 00:13:48.033
Who can take them out?

00:14:12.235 --> 00:14:18.850
You can give Me flowers. If you have got
flowers, I’ll take them.

00:14:27.648 --> 00:14:30.127
Thank you.

00:14:31.473 --> 00:14:34.658
Thank you very much.

00:14:35.918 --> 00:14:41.098
What is it? Boy: Chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate.

00:14:41.299 --> 00:14:43.925
Boy: Yes, chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate. Chocolate, Shri Mataji.

00:14:44.126 --> 00:14:47.860
Thank you. Thank you very much.

00:14:53.589 --> 00:14:56.201
Thank you.

00:15:38.588 --> 00:15:41.262
Thank you.

00:15:42.471 --> 00:15:45.058
Thank you.

00:15:58.459 --> 00:16:01.300
Avinash: Can we have some volunteers?
Please, take the children out.

00:16:01.501 --> 00:16:03.551
Shri Mataji would like the children
to play outside.

00:16:03.752 --> 00:16:07.455
Can we have some mothers, some aunties
if they can please take them out?

00:16:07.721 --> 00:16:10.602
So we can proceed, please.

00:16:11.020 --> 00:16:14.686
Any volunteers, anyone?

00:16:15.313 --> 00:16:19.750
If Yuva Shakti... You'll get as much
vibrations, please.
