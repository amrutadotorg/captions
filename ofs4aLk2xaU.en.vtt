He's saying: "Oh Mother Shakti give me...

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:20.920

He's... as a little hard.

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:28.120
You just say: "Mother, are You the Shakti of Shiva?"

00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:30.760
Just ask the question.

00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.200
Three times.

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:46.880
Aah!

00:13:56.640 --> 00:14:01.640
Who else?  Now you and somebody else. Great! All of them are!

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:04.440
Who else is with you ?

00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:08.480
Two persons are better.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:15.720
All of you have been? All the rest have been?

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.920
Rub it.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.360
Rub it hard.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:31.920
Ah! Bus [Hindi: "enough"].  Now see.

Done all of you or there is somebody else left now?

00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:05.400
José you've washed My Feet sometimes?

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.960
He did very well.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:13.040
Both the hands.

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:19.880
What's he saying?

00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:24.000
"We're not allowed to lie and say no..

00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.000
These lies are allowed.

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.880
These are sweet lies.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:51.080
You felt it, cool breeze?

00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:56.160
She is from... she is from Como.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:03.160
Yogi: "She is a Sahaja Yogini from Italy." She has washed My Feet?

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.480
Yes. She was there at the beginning.

00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:11.200
Done, done, here; rub it here a little bit...

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:14.640
Nabhi... Vishudhi

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:18.680
Ha! Now all right. See.

00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:25.240
The cheeks are becoming like nice reddish stuff, you see.

00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.680
Very sweet.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:31.200
May God bless you.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:51.040
Take this out.Slowly, slowly take this out.

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.960
Just slowly.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:58.080
Slowly, both of you should,because it may fall.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.000
This water is important.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:05.920
Because you can use it for your gardens and things.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.440
We have to thank Don, because he's the one who came to Spain

00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:54.440
and who did the...

00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.520
May God bless you! May God bless you.

00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:31.240
Now if you could just bring all these things you know, here

00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:36.720
and just you can go on saying the mantra of the

00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:40.680
108 names you can't say,  21 names you don't have here anything.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:45.480
so say the mantras of the 7 chakras that's all.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:50.160
and I'll wash My Hands with something like that.

00:20:57.400 --> 00:21:01.920
Warren you can do that. Seven Chakras. You can start it.

00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:05.360
Just keep it here.

00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:10.240
I'll tell you one by one; you pour it in My Hand

00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:13.400
Little bit of ghee, little one spoon.

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.720
Come along, you have to say some mantras of the seven chakras.

00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:23.520
All right. All of you should say. Make it little slower.

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.760
It's a... what you call it? Madhu [= honey]

00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:54.400
You got lot of milk in it?

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.720
Put more of that.

00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:06.480
All of them can come into it.Now put Water.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.400
Dahi [= yoghurt].

00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.400
You have more dahi?

00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:03.240
More dahi there? Yoghurt?

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.640
You have more yoghurt?

00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:27.440
Don't use, don't use this brass for yoghurt.

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.640
Just pour it direct.

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:53.800
Just that..

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:14.040
This is also brass.This is also brass, don't worry..

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:44.760
Milk now.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:10.040
That water,- we put it in there.

00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.800
We want that pot.

00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.080
We want that pot that she had brought.
So, - put it in there, this one is (?) see,- this is brass.

00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:03.200
Can I have little bit to wash My Hands? Little water.

00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:20.640
No, no...
			Come along..sit down..good girl..
Yogini-"The saree, Shri Mataji, the saree?"
	Saree? - you got the saree?

00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:16.120
Get seven ladies to put it on.

00:40:24.480 --> 00:40:27.800
Seven married women.
			"spanish one Shri Mataji?

00:40:33.640 --> 00:40:39.360
Spanish ladies from Spain.

00:40:40.720 --> 00:40:46.000
How many there are?

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:53.480
"Just three, Shri Mataji." It's all right.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:11.160
So very lucky, thank you.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.760
Open it.

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:20.280
You have to take the photographs now. Get the photographer.

00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:25.840
Spanish photographer you should get.
			It's a crown!- I see, it's a crown..

00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:39.080
Daisies! First time.

00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.960
Let Me have the mirror.

00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.800
Looks nice on Me, the daisies. White saree...

00:43:54.120 --> 00:44:00.000
First time I Am in Puja in white saree. Have you noticed that?

00:44:24.080 --> 00:44:27.720
First time in a white saree: isn't it surprising?

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.200
Coming for the program.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:39.560
Just take the photograph now.

00:44:39.720 --> 00:44:44.840
I think, I think miracles may take place today...

00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.200
with the white saree, I don't know. Maybe.

00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.400
"It's the ninth day of the moon, Shri Mataji." Yes, very nice day.

00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:55.320
Eighth day. Is very good; Ashtami.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:45:01.560
It's the best day for the Puja.

00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:14.320
I seldom have white, except for the Shiva  Puja.

00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:46.600
[UNCLEAR] the  Feet also...[INAUDIBLE]

00:45:46.920 --> 00:45:52.520
Specially for the Spanish.

00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:29.760
All right? First time the daisy. First time the white.

00:46:30.520 --> 00:46:34.680
Take it without the blue saree then. Isn't it..

00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:39.040
But it looks nice. This combination looks nice.

00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:42.440
May God bless you!

00:46:48.280 --> 00:46:54.240
May God bless today all the Spanish SahajaYogis.

00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:05.320
Let Spain take to Sahaja Yoga very fast and transform themselves.

00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:18.600
And all those today who have been in the program and yesterday...

00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:25.160
should all take to Sahaja Yoga seriously and work it out.

00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:42.240
They must respect their Realization...

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:49.640
and must pay full attention

00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:53.200
and importance to their lives.

00:48:02.320 --> 00:48:06.680
May God bless them all with wisdom.

00:48:11.560 --> 00:48:16.440
May God bless them all with wisdom. May God bless you all.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.680
You see the Kundalini. You take out your coat otherwise I can't see.

00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.680
Can you take out his coat? I can't see your [UNCLEAR].
			The light is there.

00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:20.320
Ask him also... take out his coat.

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:24.840
I want to see your back.

00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:30.640
Bend down full; bend down full.

00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.800
May God bless you all!

00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:04.960
Now the only chakra which  I feel is the right Nabhi.

00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:08.240
That means you all have little bit of a problem of food.

00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.480
So look after it. May God bless you!

00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:14.840
May God bless you! May God bless you!

00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:44.120
You look after your livers, -thats important.

00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:52.200
I think your food here is very oily, I think.

00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:56.080
Try to reduce fats, you see.

00:50:56.360 --> 00:50:59.440
It's very oily food you have.

00:51:21.160 --> 00:51:25.040
Yogi: "There's a gift for you, Mother." What is that?

00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:32.120
Thank you.

00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.400
Fan... aah!

00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:42.720
I brought two fans when I was coming to Spain I brought two fans.
			I knew it will be hot.

00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:50.880
In India we have fans everywhere.

00:51:51.400 --> 00:51:53.880
Can you open it?

00:51:56.120 --> 00:52:00.200
What is that?

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.800
Yogi: "This is the bhajans translated into Spanish."

00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:13.200
Oh I see! Ah! Good idea.

00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:15.720
Yogi: "The book is made by Sahaja Yogis."

00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.960
This one? Oh beautiful!

00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:29.240
This is Spanish language?

00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:39.680
I'll have to learn at least Spanish.

00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:59.320
"Here are some presents for the Swiss and English." All right.

00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.560
Yogi: "Swiss Brothers."  For Swiss brothers.

00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:26.200
Now you have brothers and sisters all over the world.

00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:33.440
This is for English? English Brothers.

00:53:40.720 --> 00:53:45.240
Oh, I see! This one is good for The Advent.

00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:53.360
So, you have to go on distributing it to all of them, one each.

00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.480
Thank you very much.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:07.560
Now you have friends in... brothers and sisters in America...

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.640
Spain, France,

00:54:14.920 --> 00:54:19.160
Switzerland, Italy...

00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:22.480
and now we will be going to Greece also.

00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.840
in Germany, in Austria

00:54:28.560 --> 00:54:33.000
and after this program, as you know, after the Paris program

00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:35.720
we are going to...

00:54:38.840 --> 00:54:42.120
first... to

00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.240
What is the country?

00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:51.000
Yes to Belgium. But what is the capital?

00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.160
Yogi: "Brussels." Brussels which is the capital of Belgium...

00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:59.320
and then Holland. In Holland we are going where? Hague or ?
			"Den Haag, Shri Mataji"

00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.280
We are going to Hague...all right.
			We are going to Hague,

00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:08.640
and there is going to be seminar.

00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:12.280
You are going to meet all your brothers and sisters

00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.040
for this Guru Puja especially.

00:55:14.200 --> 00:55:16.400
They all are looking forward.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.360
Christine also is coming from America

00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.800
and I think Danny has come from America...

00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:26.320
and I don't know... maybe one or two might come.

00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:31.520
So you will meet lots of people. May God bless you!

00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:40.800
Next time I will come for more time to Spain.

00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.280
Yogi: "Shri Mataji! I just would like to thank all the

00:55:50.480 --> 00:55:54.240
Spanish Sahaja Yogis the way they welcome us,

00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.440
it remind us very much India and Indians.

00:55:57.520 --> 00:56:02.840
How they welcome us with warmth and love and affection.

00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:07.040
Even if it would have been 1000 miles more...

00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:12.040
we would have been very happy to meet them. It was very beautiful."

00:56:12.240 --> 00:56:17.440
You have to learn from them. One has to learn from this.

00:56:52.360 --> 00:56:54.560
Yogi: "We have been to the seaside Shri Mataji!

00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.040
We got sea here in this country, we have got mountains

00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:00.120
so to remind them that...

00:57:00.240 --> 00:57:03.040
we are still surrounded by mountains in our country,

00:57:03.200 --> 00:57:09.200
we have a poster for all the Sahaja Yogis just to see that...

00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:15.920
Shri Mataji is crowned not only by the sea, but by the mountains too."
			Just open it.

00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:25.880
It's a colour photograph they can give to people, - from you Shri Mataji."
			All of you can have one.

00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:26.920
This is the one, - really remarkable, isn't it?

00:58:27.320 --> 00:58:29.720
Just My Hand.

00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:34.120
You might say I was holding a light or something.

00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:39.960
Very remarkable. It's very remarkable.

00:58:53.920 --> 00:58:59.880
Slowly, slowly one can expose oneself. Isn't it?

00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:18.760
And this one is? Yogi:"This is one of your picture too, Shri Mataji."

00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:24.640
One of My pictures? Yes, for the Spanish Sahaja Yogis.

00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:51.440
I really look a Spanish.

00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.960
Distribute that.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.280
This one at... in Austria.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.160
Somebody gave me this.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.480
In Paris, in Paris, sorry.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.000
Ya, you gave, he gave, he gave it. I've got it at home.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.840
May God bless you!

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:45.600
So now we can have our food and then at tomorrow...

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.720
"Prasad for Shri Mataji." Prasad I have to eat.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.360
You see Gods and Godessess are supposed to just see it; not to eat.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:04.320
Now which one is Spanish in this?

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.000
Spanish? Really?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.120
Looks like Indian.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.720
Just like Indian.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.840
What? Yogi: "The brown colour."

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:33.040
Spanish cake? What is it called?

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.440
Yogi: "Made with almonds."

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.720
So what is all the white things?

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.680
This one I know. Mr Srivastava likes this. This is very famous.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.760
it's a very famous one...

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.400
What is it called?

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:25.200
What is it called in Spanish language? "Turrón"

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.400
Curan?

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.720
Curan is Curan from Koran?

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.800
It makes the sound "kur kur" that's why.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.840
Thank you very much.
