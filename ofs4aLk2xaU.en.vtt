13:23.560 --> 13:25.000
He's... as a little hard.

13:25.120 --> 13:28.120
You just say: "Mother, are You the Shakti of Shiva?"

13:28.280 --> 13:30.760
Just ask the question.

13:37.280 --> 13:40.200
Three times.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.880
Aah!

13:56.640 --> 14:01.640
Who else?  Now you and somebody else. Great! All of them are!

14:02.080 --> 14:04.440
Who else is with you ?

14:04.720 --> 14:08.480
Two persons are better.

14:10.360 --> 14:15.720
All of you have been? All the rest have been?

14:16.680 --> 14:19.920
Rub it.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.360

15:27.600 --> 15:31.920

15:41.600 --> 15:47.080
Done all of you or there is somebody else left now?

16:01.520 --> 16:05.400
José you've washed My Feet sometimes?

16:05.800 --> 16:08.960
He did very well.

16:09.280 --> 16:13.040
Both the hands.

16:18.520 --> 16:19.880
What's he saying?

16:20.080 --> 16:24.000
"We're not allowed to lie and say no..

16:25.120 --> 16:28.000
These lies are allowed.

16:28.360 --> 16:31.880
These are sweet lies.

16:48.520 --> 16:51.080
You felt it, cool breeze?

16:51.280 --> 16:56.160
She is from... she is from Como.

16:57.960 --> 17:03.160
Yogi: "She is a Sahaja Yogini from Italy." She has washed My Feet?

17:03.400 --> 17:07.480
Yes. She was there at the beginning.

17:08.160 --> 17:11.200
Done, done, here; rub it here a little bit...

17:11.440 --> 17:14.640
Nabhi... Vishudhi

17:15.040 --> 17:18.680
Ha! Now all right. See.

17:19.520 --> 17:25.240
The cheeks are becoming like nice reddish stuff, you see.

17:25.440 --> 17:27.680
Very sweet.

17:27.960 --> 17:31.200
May God bless you.

17:47.840 --> 17:51.040
Take this out.Slowly, slowly take this out.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.960
Just slowly.

17:54.520 --> 17:58.080
Slowly, both of you should,because it may fall.

17:58.320 --> 18:00.000
This water is important.

18:00.320 --> 18:05.920
Because you can use it for your gardens and things.

19:47.160 --> 19:51.440
We have to thank Don, because he's the one who came to Spain

19:51.720 --> 19:54.440
and who did the...

20:11.200 --> 20:16.520
May God bless you! May God bless you.

20:25.360 --> 20:31.240
Now if you could just bring all these things you know, here

20:31.520 --> 20:36.720
and just you can go on saying the mantra of the

20:36.960 --> 20:40.680
108 names you can't say,  21 names you don't have here anything.

20:40.800 --> 20:45.480
so say the mantras of the 7 chakras that's all.

20:45.800 --> 20:50.160
and I'll wash My Hands with something like that.

20:57.400 --> 21:01.920
Warren you can do that. Seven Chakras. You can start it.

21:02.160 --> 21:05.360
Just keep it here.

21:06.280 --> 21:10.240
I'll tell you one by one; you pour it in My Hand

21:10.440 --> 21:13.400
Little bit of ghee, little one spoon.

21:13.720 --> 21:17.720
Come along, you have to say some mantras of the seven chakras.

21:17.960 --> 21:23.520
All right. All of you should say. Make it little slower.

21:37.800 --> 21:41.760
It's a... what you call it? Madhu [= honey]

21:50.640 --> 21:54.400
You got lot of milk in it?

21:59.720 --> 22:01.720
Put more of that.

22:01.960 --> 22:06.480
All of them can come into it.Now put Water.

22:42.480 --> 22:46.400
Dahi [= yoghurt].

22:54.880 --> 22:57.400
You have more dahi?

22:57.520 --> 23:03.240
More dahi there? Yoghurt?

23:04.640 --> 23:09.640
You have more yoghurt?

23:23.200 --> 23:27.440
Don't use, don't use this brass for yoghurt.

23:27.640 --> 23:31.640
Just pour it direct.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.800
Just that..

24:08.840 --> 24:14.040
This is also brass.This is also brass, don't worry..

24:40.400 --> 24:44.760
Milk now.

26:05.400 --> 26:10.040

So, - put it in there, this one is (?) see,- this is brass.

27:57.200 --> 28:03.200
Can I have little bit to wash My Hands? Little water.

40:24.480 --> 40:27.800
Seven married women.

40:33.640 --> 40:39.360
Spanish ladies from Spain.

40:40.720 --> 40:46.000
How many there are?

40:47.640 --> 40:53.480
"Just three, Shri Mataji." It's all right.

41:06.960 --> 41:11.160
So very lucky, thank you.

41:11.560 --> 41:14.760
Open it.

43:15.160 --> 43:20.280
You have to take the photographs now. Get the photographer.

43:20.520 --> 43:25.840
Spanish photographer you should get.
			It's a crown!- I see, it's a crown..

43:36.120 --> 43:39.080
Daisies! First time.

43:39.400 --> 43:42.960
Let Me have the mirror.

43:50.640 --> 43:53.800
Looks nice on Me, the daisies. White saree...

43:54.120 --> 44:00.000
First time I Am in Puja in white saree. Have you noticed that?

44:24.080 --> 44:27.720
First time in a white saree: isn't it surprising?

44:28.200 --> 44:31.200
Coming for the program.

44:37.120 --> 44:39.560
Just take the photograph now.

44:39.720 --> 44:44.840
I think, I think miracles may take place today...

44:45.160 --> 44:48.200
with the white saree, I don't know. Maybe.

44:48.480 --> 44:52.400
"It's the ninth day of the moon, Shri Mataji." Yes, very nice day.

44:52.680 --> 44:55.320
Eighth day. Is very good; Ashtami.

44:55.840 --> 45:01.560
It's the best day for the Puja.

45:09.640 --> 45:14.320
I seldom have white, except for the Shiva  Puja.

45:41.840 --> 45:46.600
[UNCLEAR] the  Feet also...[INAUDIBLE]

45:46.920 --> 45:52.520
Specially for the Spanish.

46:23.760 --> 46:29.760
All right? First time the daisy. First time the white.

46:30.520 --> 46:34.680
Take it without the blue saree then. Isn't it..

46:34.800 --> 46:39.040
But it looks nice. This combination looks nice.

46:39.160 --> 46:42.440
May God bless you!

46:48.280 --> 46:54.240
May God bless today all the Spanish SahajaYogis.

46:59.320 --> 47:05.320
Let Spain take to Sahaja Yoga very fast and transform themselves.

47:13.680 --> 47:18.600
And all those today who have been in the program and yesterday...

47:18.880 --> 47:25.160
should all take to Sahaja Yoga seriously and work it out.

47:36.280 --> 47:42.240
They must respect their Realization...

47:45.800 --> 47:49.640
and must pay full attention

47:49.840 --> 47:53.200
and importance to their lives.

48:02.320 --> 48:06.680
May God bless them all with wisdom.

48:11.560 --> 48:16.440
May God bless them all with wisdom. May God bless you all.

48:55.000 --> 49:00.680
You see the Kundalini. You take out your coat otherwise I can't see.

49:00.960 --> 49:05.680
Can you take out his coat? I can't see your [UNCLEAR].
			The light is there.

49:16.640 --> 49:20.320
Ask him also... take out his coat.

49:21.120 --> 49:24.840
I want to see your back.

49:26.560 --> 49:30.640
Bend down full; bend down full.

49:58.440 --> 50:01.800
May God bless you all!

50:02.040 --> 50:04.960
Now the only chakra which  I feel is the right Nabhi.

50:05.080 --> 50:08.240
That means you all have little bit of a problem of food.

50:08.600 --> 50:11.480
So look after it. May God bless you!

50:11.680 --> 50:14.840
May God bless you! May God bless you!

50:39.600 --> 50:44.120
You look after your livers, -thats important.

50:47.560 --> 50:52.200
I think your food here is very oily, I think.

50:52.680 --> 50:56.080
Try to reduce fats, you see.

50:56.360 --> 50:59.440
It's very oily food you have.

51:21.160 --> 51:25.040
Yogi: "There's a gift for you, Mother." What is that?

51:29.000 --> 51:32.120
Thank you.

51:32.760 --> 51:35.400
Fan... aah!

51:37.240 --> 51:42.720
I brought two fans when I was coming to Spain I brought two fans.
			I knew it will be hot.

51:47.360 --> 51:50.880
In India we have fans everywhere.

51:51.400 --> 51:53.880
Can you open it?

51:56.120 --> 52:00.200
What is that?

52:06.600 --> 52:09.800
Yogi: "This is the bhajans translated into Spanish."

52:09.960 --> 52:13.200
Oh I see! Ah! Good idea.

52:13.360 --> 52:15.720
Yogi: "The book is made by Sahaja Yogis."

52:15.880 --> 52:18.960
This one? Oh beautiful!

52:25.400 --> 52:29.240
This is Spanish language?

52:34.360 --> 52:39.680
I'll have to learn at least Spanish.

52:53.760 --> 52:59.320
"Here are some presents for the Swiss and English." All right.

53:10.080 --> 53:15.560
Yogi: "Swiss Brothers."  For Swiss brothers.

53:20.640 --> 53:26.200
Now you have brothers and sisters all over the world.

53:27.960 --> 53:33.440
This is for English? English Brothers.

53:40.720 --> 53:45.240
Oh, I see! This one is good for The Advent.

53:46.920 --> 53:53.360
So, you have to go on distributing it to all of them, one each.

53:55.760 --> 53:58.480
Thank you very much.

54:02.600 --> 54:07.560
Now you have friends in... brothers and sisters in America...

We are going to Hague...all right.
			We are going to Hague,

55:05.560 --> 55:08.640
and there is going to be seminar.

55:08.840 --> 55:12.280
You are going to meet all your brothers and sisters

55:12.440 --> 55:14.040
for this Guru Puja especially.

55:14.200 --> 55:16.400
They all are looking forward.

55:16.560 --> 55:20.360
Christine also is coming from America

55:20.640 --> 55:23.800
and I think Danny has come from America...

55:23.960 --> 55:26.320
and I don't know... maybe one or two might come.

55:26.480 --> 55:31.520
So you will meet lots of people. May God bless you!

55:35.960 --> 55:40.800
Next time I will come for more time to Spain.

55:47.320 --> 55:50.280
Yogi: "Shri Mataji! I just would like to thank all the

55:50.480 --> 55:54.240
Spanish Sahaja Yogis the way they welcome us,

55:54.320 --> 55:57.440
it remind us very much India and Indians.

55:57.520 --> 56:02.840
How they welcome us with warmth and love and affection.

56:04.120 --> 56:07.040
Even if it would have been 1000 miles more...

56:07.200 --> 56:12.040
we would have been very happy to meet them. It was very beautiful."

56:12.240 --> 56:17.440
You have to learn from them. One has to learn from this.

56:52.360 --> 56:54.560
Yogi: "We have been to the seaside Shri Mataji!

56:54.720 --> 56:58.040
We got sea here in this country, we have got mountains

56:58.200 --> 57:00.120
so to remind them that...

57:00.240 --> 57:03.040
we are still surrounded by mountains in our country,

57:03.200 --> 57:09.200
we have a poster for all the Sahaja Yogis just to see that...

57:10.240 --> 57:15.920
Shri Mataji is crowned not only by the sea, but by the mountains too."
			Just open it.

57:21.880 --> 57:25.880
It's a colour photograph they can give to people, - from you Shri Mataji."
			All of you can have one.

58:23.240 --> 58:26.920
This is the one, - really remarkable, isn't it?

58:27.320 --> 58:29.720
Just My Hand.

58:30.040 --> 58:34.120
You might say I was holding a light or something.

58:34.560 --> 58:39.960
Very remarkable. It's very remarkable.

58:53.920 --> 58:59.880
Slowly, slowly one can expose oneself. Isn't it?

59:13.560 --> 59:18.760
And this one is? Yogi:"This is one of your picture too, Shri Mataji."

59:19.280 --> 59:24.640
One of My pictures? Yes, for the Spanish Sahaja Yogis.

59:47.040 --> 59:51.440
I really look a Spanish.

59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.960
Distribute that.

01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:16.280
This one at... in Austria.

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:20.160
Somebody gave me this.

01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:26.480
In Paris, in Paris, sorry.

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:34.000
Ya, you gave, he gave, he gave it. I've got it at home.

01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.840
May God bless you!

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:45.600
So now we can have our food and then at tomorrow...

01:00:45.800 --> 01:00:51.720
"Prasad for Shri Mataji." Prasad I have to eat.

01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:59.360
You see Gods and Godessess are supposed to just see it; not to eat.

01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:04.320
Now which one is Spanish in this?

01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:10.000
Spanish? Really?

01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.120
Looks like Indian.

01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:19.720
Just like Indian.

01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.840
What? Yogi: "The brown colour."

01:01:28.360 --> 01:01:33.040
Spanish cake? What is it called?

01:01:36.600 --> 01:01:39.440
Yogi: "Made with almonds."

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:55.720
So what is all the white things?

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:04.680
This one I know. Mr Srivastava likes this. This is very famous.

01:02:04.920 --> 01:02:10.760
it's a very famous one...

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.400
What is it called?

01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:25.200
What is it called in Spanish language? "Turrón"

01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.400
Curan?

01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:44.720
Curan is Curan from Koran?

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:53.800
It makes the sound "kur kur" that's why.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:07.840
Thank you very much.
