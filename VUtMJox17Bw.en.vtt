00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.640
Tomorrow is a great day for all of us because\h
it’s the Guru Puja Day, and perhaps you know that\h\h

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.520
Guru puja is the greatest\h
day for all the sahaja yogis,\h\h

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.680
also for Me.
Of course, Sahasrara is the day, which is\h\h

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:44.240
very important, which makes a big history in the\h
spirituality and also in the evolutionary process.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.560
But for us the sahaja yogis and Myself –\h\h

00:00:52.160 --> 00:01:02.720
it’s very remarkable that we are here to\h
know something and to teach something.\h

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.000
Now, if you see how Sahaja Yoga knowledge\h\h

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.840
has slowly come to all of you.
Gyaneshwara\h\h

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.320
has described it so beautifully – he says, “Like\h
the petals when they fall on the Mother Earth,\h\h

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.720
gently,\h\h

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:47.360
in the same way, let this knowledge fall onto the\h
minds of the disciples and make them fragrant."

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.720
Another thing described is a bird called Chakoor,\h\h

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:07.840
which is a bird which just at the time of\h
full moon, sucks the nectar of moonlight,\h\h

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:14.920
otherwise, it doesn’t care for\h
anything else, it feeds only on itself.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.840
So he says, “Let the knowledge\h
of the Divine be sucked\h\h

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.040
in by the disciples like the Chakoora bird\h
who sucks in the nectar of the moonlight."

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.880
Moon stands for the Spirit.

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.680
In the same manner, let it\h
penetrate into their being.\h

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.880
After all, he was a very great\h
poet, I must say, in poetry,\h\h

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:55.440
nobody can go as deep as\h
Gyaneshwara has gone, no one.\h

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.040
So slowly and steadily,\h\h

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:06.800
very gently, beautifully the knowledge of the\h
Divine has penetrate, penetrated into your being.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.760
It is evident on your central nervous system,\h\h

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:24.080
on your face, on your behavior, on\h
your understanding, on your habits.\h

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.080
In every way, but specially\h
in your eyes like a light.\h

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.480
There’s a light in the eyes\h
of all the sahaja yogis\h\h

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.400
and that light shows that\h
they are enlightened people.\h

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:55.440
It happens, of course, because Sahaja\h
Yoga was supposed to do your Realization.\h

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:06.640
Then the second part was to teach\h
you about decoding the Divine laws,\h\h

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:18.320
telling you about what it means, why,\h
feeling those vibrations on your fingertips;\h\h

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.200
then also how to correct yourself,\h
what correction is needed.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:33.840
By making you your own Guru, slowly and steadily\h
you could see what was wrong in your machinery\h\h

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:43.120
so that you absorbed it, very gradually\h
and very beautifully within yourself.\h

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:55.840
It’s a very delicate work and in no university\h
whatsoever, or in no school or college,\h\h

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.880
this kind of loving imbibement is possible.\h

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.960
Everything moves so slowly with all\h
the blessings and auspiciousness\h\h

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:20.160
and all the beauty and glory, being exposed\h
to you of your own and of that of Divine.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.200
Every moment you saw how the blessings worked.
Today only they told Me, “It’s very cold there."

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:31.040
I said, “All right, it will be warmer today."

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:45.040
So the Divine immediately made it warmer.
It’s so simple that\h\h

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.840
the Divine is anxious to look after you, to\h\h

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:55.280
make you happy, to make you joyous,\h
to enjoy every moment of your life,\h\h

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:10.160
to enjoy yourself, to enjoy your own\h
beauty; and the whole flow is so beautiful\h\h

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:24.400
and so beautifully done within and\h
without, in your behaviour, in everything.\h

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:31.000
We have definitely started a new\h
race on this Earth, no doubt about\h\h

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.120
it – and a new age that has\h
been described is already here.\h

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:47.600
No doubt, we are very different people from all\h
other people who may profess religions, who may\h\h

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.320
have theories, they say this and that,\h
but they haven’t got your beauty.

00:06:54.800 --> 00:07:04.400
It’s clearly shown on your faces.
Today is not the way I should teach\h\h

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:13.360
you something as a Guru, but as a Mother I\h
thought, I’ll better get some presents for you.\h

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:18.800
I used to cook very well, but nowadays I don’t\h
cook so I thought better give some presents today\h\h

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:24.320
that enjoy My own love for you.
You can sing to Me.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.320
You can express your love.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.080
I’ve no way of expression of My love to you.
So whatever small things I could get,\h\h

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.120
I’ve tried to bring for you.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:42.320
I hope you’ll like it.
Of course, for all of you I couldn’t get anything,\h\h

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:46.880
whatever little thing we could do, in this short\h
time, you know I was having a real marathon,\h\h

00:07:47.440 --> 00:07:53.440
running from places to places and I could\h
only get to some airports at things, looking\h\h

00:07:53.440 --> 00:08:00.720
out for My children something here and there.
It’s a very hectic sort of a thing, but that’s\h\h

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:09.440
what I enjoy and I hope you also will enjoy.
May God bless you all!
