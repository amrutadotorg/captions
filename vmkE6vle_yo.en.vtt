1994-1016 Public Program, Sao Paulo, Brazil

00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:14.629
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:17.943 --> 00:00:25.945
At the very outset, I have to say that truth is what it is.

00:00:27.477 --> 00:00:31.136
Can they hear Me? Ask them.

00:00:31.337 --> 00:00:36.870
You cannot change it. You cannot challenge it,

00:00:37.071 --> 00:00:44.842
and unfortunately, with this human awareness you cannot know it.

00:00:45.043 --> 00:00:51.528
In our evolutionary process, we have become human beings,

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:57.198
but still we don’t know the absolute truth.

00:00:59.371 --> 00:01:05.113
A little slowly, you have to speak, it is fast, perhaps.

00:01:06.884 --> 00:01:10.210
Something more has to happen to us

00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:16.691
that we all know the absolute truth.

00:01:16.892 --> 00:01:20.426
Because we don’t know the absolute truth,

00:01:20.634 --> 00:01:25.184
that’s why we have arguments.

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:31.216
We have problems, we quarrel and fight,

00:01:31.417 --> 00:01:36.567
and ultimately we have wars.

00:01:39.118 --> 00:01:47.203
In all the scriptures, it is written that you are to be born again.

00:01:50.487 --> 00:01:53.599
Whatever I am going to tell you,

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.083
you should not take it for granted.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.401
This blind faith has brought lots of problems to us.

00:02:08.212 --> 00:02:12.083
But, you should keep your mind open as scientist

00:02:12.284 --> 00:02:17.311
and if you find what I am saying has been proved,

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:22.357
then as honest people you have to accept it.

00:02:22.558 --> 00:02:24.968
Because it is for your benevolence,

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:30.445
for the benevolence of your family,
for the benevolence of your country,

00:02:30.646 --> 00:02:36.195
and for the benevolence of the whole World.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.334
Unfortunately, most of the problems come

00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:45.841
from human beings in this World.

00:02:46.092 --> 00:02:51.639
And almost all the problems of human beings

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.429
come from these centres being in jeopardy.

00:02:57.956 --> 00:03:00.756
These subtle centres are responsible

00:03:00.957 --> 00:03:07.953
for our physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual being.

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:16.859
You have been already told about this power
Kundalini, which resides in the sacrum bone.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.219
That means the Greek knew it’s a sacred bone.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.513
This power is the power of pure desire within you.

00:03:30.714 --> 00:03:35.423
All other desires are not pure,

00:03:35.624 --> 00:03:40.671
because we want to have, say for example,

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:45.996
today we want to have a house,
then tomorrow we want to have a car,

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:52.474
then we want to have a helicopter, it
goes on like this from one to another.

00:03:52.675 --> 00:03:58.880
According to economics, wants are not satiable in general.

00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:02.022
But, whether you are aware or not,

00:04:02.223 --> 00:04:09.453
the pure desire to become one with the divine is within you.

00:04:09.654 --> 00:04:12.361
In modern times, as predicted,

00:04:12.562 --> 00:04:18.336
many people who are seeking the truth have been born.

00:04:18.537 --> 00:04:26.020
I call it as a blossom time, but they
have called it by many other names.

00:04:26.221 --> 00:04:30.675
In the Koran, it is called as Ruh.

00:04:30.876 --> 00:04:38.378
No, I am sorry Kiyama, is Kiyama. Is called as Kiyama.

00:04:38.579 --> 00:04:42.689
And in the Bible, as the Last Judgement.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.251
So, it is left to your freedom, whether you want to go to Heaven

00:04:47.452 --> 00:04:52.332
or you want to go to Hell.

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:55.090
If we look at the science,

00:04:55.291 --> 00:05:00.435
we should know that it has its own limitations.

00:05:00.636 --> 00:05:08.879
And while seeking the truth, we will
not know because it is so limited.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.466
Firstly, it is amoral

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:16.991
and secondly, it cannot answer many questions.

00:05:17.192 --> 00:05:21.865
It cannot say why are we on this Earth.

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:26.753
It cannot say what is our identity.

00:05:26.954 --> 00:05:29.559
So, people are changing their dresses,

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:33.230
changing their hairstyles, all kinds of things they do

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.723
thinking that is their identity.

00:05:36.924 --> 00:05:41.858
But the identity is within you.

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:47.817
That is, you are not this body, this mind, this intellect,

00:05:48.413 --> 00:05:54.536
these emotions, these conditionings, this ego.

00:05:54.737 --> 00:05:59.188
But you are the pure spirit.

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:02.658
When we say my intellect, my body,

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:07.007
who is the owner of this "my"?

00:06:07.208 --> 00:06:16.435
The second truth is that there is a
all-pervading divine power of love,

00:06:16.636 --> 00:06:20.948
which does all the living work.

00:06:21.149 --> 00:06:25.961
We have never felt this divine power before.

00:06:26.162 --> 00:06:30.894
It is also called by different names.

00:06:31.095 --> 00:06:34.072
Some call it the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,

00:06:34.273 --> 00:06:42.875
and some call it as the all-pervading divine power of love.

00:06:43.076 --> 00:06:48.735
And some call it as Paramchaitanya.

00:06:48.936 --> 00:06:53.142
So, the second important thing at this time is that

00:06:53.343 --> 00:06:57.659
you have to become the spirit and you have to feel

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:03.664
this all-pervading power on your central nervous system.

00:07:03.865 --> 00:07:08.227
If this does not happen, you will be restless.

00:07:08.428 --> 00:07:16.704
You’ll have all the problems and you will never feel satisfied in life.

00:07:16.905 --> 00:07:22.927
People have been seeking everywhere in these special times.

00:07:23.128 --> 00:07:26.756
They have been taking frantically so many things

00:07:26.957 --> 00:07:32.406
but they have not been able to understand what they are seeking.

00:07:32.607 --> 00:07:40.462
Firstly, we must know that it is a living process of evolution.

00:07:40.663 --> 00:07:44.362
You cannot pay for it.

00:07:44.563 --> 00:07:47.683
This is your own power

00:07:47.884 --> 00:07:56.258
and is your own potential glory has to be manifested.

00:07:58.874 --> 00:08:04.591
When this power rises within you it passes through six centres.

00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:08.632
It nourishes your six centres by which you get

00:08:08.833 --> 00:08:15.110
your physical, mental, emotional and spiritual problem solved.

00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:20.161
In India, in the Delhi University, there are four doctors now

00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:27.795
who have got their M.D. with Sahaja Yoga curing.

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:31.300
It cures many diseases

00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:38.635
and is by your own power.

00:08:38.836 --> 00:08:43.382
Is very easy to know what diseases you have.

00:08:43.583 --> 00:08:48.101
Or, to know if you have mental problems

00:08:48.302 --> 00:08:55.471
because on your fingertips you can feel your centres.

00:08:55.672 --> 00:09:01.775
These centres are, he has shown as it is,

00:09:01.976 --> 00:09:05.913
even a child can make it out.

00:09:06.114 --> 00:09:14.138
Now, if you know how to cure these centres, you get alright.

00:09:14.339 --> 00:09:18.936
You can also feel the centres of others.

00:09:19.137 --> 00:09:22.481
Thus, you can cure others also

00:09:22.682 --> 00:09:29.698
because you develop a new dimension in your awareness,

00:09:29.899 --> 00:09:35.567
which is called as collective consciousness.

00:09:35.768 --> 00:09:38.163
Second thing that happens to you,

00:09:38.364 --> 00:09:48.696
that you become absolutely thoughtlessly aware.

00:09:48.897 --> 00:09:54.894
If I say you that pay attention to yourself, you cannot pay.

00:09:55.095 --> 00:10:03.602
If I say that you stand in your presence, you cannot – present.

00:10:03.803 --> 00:10:09.214
We only think about the future or about the past.

00:10:09.415 --> 00:10:13.945
The past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

00:10:14.146 --> 00:10:18.774
So, to be in the present, something more has to happen

00:10:18.975 --> 00:10:23.193
because present is the reality.

00:10:23.394 --> 00:10:27.272
So, when this Kundalini rises, she elongates our thoughts

00:10:27.473 --> 00:10:32.923
and we become thoughtlessly aware.

00:10:33.124 --> 00:10:39.827
We are fully aware but there is no thought.

00:10:41.339 --> 00:10:43.662
If you want to think, you can think

00:10:43.863 --> 00:10:50.458
but actually you get divine inspirations.

00:10:51.675 --> 00:10:53.946
When you are thoughtlessly aware,

00:10:54.147 --> 00:10:59.172
you are absolutely peaceful within yourself.

00:10:59.373 --> 00:11:05.243
You watch the whole World like a drama and you are a witness.

00:11:05.444 --> 00:11:09.127
All your worries disappear, all your problems disappear,

00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:13.418
you get out of them.

00:11:14.905 --> 00:11:20.034
As if the divine power takes over.

00:11:20.235 --> 00:11:22.402
Like this instrument [the mic] has no meaning

00:11:22.603 --> 00:11:25.200
unless and until it is connected to the mains,

00:11:25.401 --> 00:11:27.856
in the same way, our life has no meaning

00:11:28.057 --> 00:11:33.901
unless and until we are connected to this all-pervading power.

00:11:34.189 --> 00:11:39.516
Your attention also becomes very innocent,

00:11:39.717 --> 00:11:44.131
devoid of any lust or greed.

00:11:44.985 --> 00:11:49.269
When we take to religions, we should understand that

00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:55.264
today the religions have reached another state of perversion.

00:11:55.465 --> 00:11:57.934
They are money-orientated or power-orientated,

00:11:58.134 --> 00:12:02.687
and are fighting among themselves.

00:12:02.888 --> 00:12:08.210
One may call yourself as Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything,

00:12:08.411 --> 00:12:13.021
anybody can commit any sin.

00:12:13.554 --> 00:12:15.988
Also, people like Christ and Mohammed Sahib,

00:12:16.189 --> 00:12:19.515
all such great people were really so pure

00:12:19.716 --> 00:12:24.639
and did not know what sort of people they are facing.

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.214
Whatever they have commanded is for the saints,

00:12:28.415 --> 00:12:34.035
for the enlightened ones but not for normal human beings.

00:12:34.236 --> 00:12:39.634
Normal beings cannot, normal human beings, cannot follow them.

00:12:40.711 --> 00:12:45.027
Like Christ has said in the 5th chapter of Matthews,

00:12:45.228 --> 00:12:50.989
that if your one eye commits a sin, you take it out.

00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:59.380
Or, if your hand does any sinful thing, you cut your hand.

00:12:59.581 --> 00:13:05.966
If somebody slaps on one cheek, turn the other cheek.

00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:12.641
I haven’t seen any Christian without eyes and without hands, so far.

00:13:12.842 --> 00:13:15.236
That means Christians are not Christians,

00:13:15.437 --> 00:13:19.585
they are not following Christ at all.

00:13:19.786 --> 00:13:23.780
Even Mohammed Sahib was worse.

00:13:23.981 --> 00:13:27.656
He thought all the rules and regulations are only for men,

00:13:27.857 --> 00:13:31.481
so do something more for women.

00:13:31.682 --> 00:13:35.435
So, he said any woman who has bad intentions

00:13:35.636 --> 00:13:40.513
about any man should be buried in the Mother Earth half-way

00:13:40.714 --> 00:13:45.957
and should be put to death with stones.

00:13:46.719 --> 00:13:53.142
Now, please tell me in America,
how many would live, American women?

00:13:53.343 --> 00:13:57.463
So, this kind of serious, very strict rules

00:13:57.664 --> 00:14:02.271
were made for ordinary human beings.

00:14:02.813 --> 00:14:06.276
Because they did not know what human beings are like,

00:14:06.477 --> 00:14:10.493
that’s why they crucified him.

00:14:11.552 --> 00:14:17.575
They had no sensitivity of spirituality.

00:14:18.317 --> 00:14:22.781
So first, one has to become an enlightened soul, a saint,

00:14:22.982 --> 00:14:27.950
then only one can follow Christ or Mohammed Sahib.

00:14:28.330 --> 00:14:31.397
A normal human being is full of weaknesses

00:14:31.598 --> 00:14:37.605
and it’s too much to follow these great, great people.

00:14:38.093 --> 00:14:43.538
In Sahaja Yoga, we have no punishments.

00:14:44.477 --> 00:14:48.738
There’s only divine love.

00:14:48.939 --> 00:14:54.121
Because we understand as human beings as they are.

00:14:54.955 --> 00:14:56.980
But with the Kundalini awakening,

00:14:57.181 --> 00:15:02.646
you become exactly what Christ has asked you to be.

00:15:02.847 --> 00:15:10.194
That is, your attention becomes absolutely innocent,

00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:15.184
devoid of lust and greed.

00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:21.688
And this pure attention becomes very powerful.

00:15:23.927 --> 00:15:29.091
With this attention, which is so pure,

00:15:29.292 --> 00:15:33.294
the person emits peace and joy.

00:15:33.495 --> 00:15:37.995
And creates a very holy atmosphere.

00:15:38.196 --> 00:15:42.528
It’s not talking but it’s a happening.

00:15:42.729 --> 00:15:49.970
It is no sermon but actualisation of the baptism.

00:15:51.001 --> 00:15:56.799
One has to know that you cannot pay for this living process.

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.925
God does not understand money.

00:16:01.126 --> 00:16:07.415
You can pay for this hall but you cannot pay for your self-realisation.

00:16:07.616 --> 00:16:11.522
Or, for your enlightenment.

00:16:11.933 --> 00:16:15.139
If you just apply this test, to people, you will know

00:16:15.340 --> 00:16:20.797
who are false and who are real.

00:16:23.163 --> 00:16:26.806
In this short lecture, I may not be able to tell you

00:16:27.007 --> 00:16:30.937
all about Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:31.138 --> 00:16:33.368
Saha means ‘with’ and ja mean ‘born’.

00:16:33.569 --> 00:16:36.302
Born with you is the right to have this Yoga,

00:16:36.503 --> 00:16:41.279
means the union with the divine power.

00:16:42.776 --> 00:16:48.213
This is your right; this is your birth right to have it.

00:16:48.414 --> 00:16:54.286
Last time, when I was driving, I went over São Paulo.

00:16:54.487 --> 00:17:03.183
And I felt there are many seekers here
because there were holy vibrations.

00:17:03.384 --> 00:17:09.948
And I asked them, please organize some program in São Paulo.

00:17:10.625 --> 00:17:16.465
Because there are so many real seekers here.

00:17:18.104 --> 00:17:26.279
And I am happy that you all have come for your self-realisation.

00:17:27.066 --> 00:17:35.068
Above all, you jump into the ocean of joy.

00:17:35.269 --> 00:17:41.685
Happiness and unhappiness are the two coins of one coin…

00:17:41.886 --> 00:17:47.030
I should say two sides of one coin.

00:17:47.498 --> 00:17:50.140
When your ego is pampered you feel happy

00:17:50.343 --> 00:17:54.726
and when it is punctured you feel unhappy.

00:17:54.927 --> 00:17:59.346
But joy is singular,

00:17:59.547 --> 00:18:04.472
where you witness the whole World

00:18:04.673 --> 00:18:11.335
and you see everything as a beautiful creation of God.

00:18:11.536 --> 00:18:13.762
And your attention is so powerful

00:18:13.963 --> 00:18:18.567
that you can solve so many problems of the World.

00:18:19.531 --> 00:18:24.765
You reach another state, which we call as doubtless awareness,

00:18:24.966 --> 00:18:29.141
where you get all the powers to raise the Kundalini of others,

00:18:29.342 --> 00:18:33.809
give them their self-knowledge.

00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:40.595
You can cure others, you can create peace on this Earth.

00:18:41.184 --> 00:18:45.420
Because you become innately righteous.

00:18:45.621 --> 00:18:49.701
I don’t have to tell you, "don’t do this, don’t do that."

00:18:49.902 --> 00:18:53.288
It’s like this, if I have a snake in my hand

00:18:53.489 --> 00:18:57.196
and I am very adamant; if you tell me there is a snake,

00:18:57.397 --> 00:19:01.641
I won’t believe, I’ll say it’s a rope.

00:19:01.842 --> 00:19:07.873
Because, because there is darkness, I can’t see.

00:19:08.074 --> 00:19:13.048
because there is darkness, I can’t see.

00:19:13.599 --> 00:19:20.591
And I am adamant, I don’t want to believe
till the snake bites me, I don’t believe.

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:26.888
But as soon as there is some light, I myself throw away the snake.

00:19:27.512 --> 00:19:32.105
All that is destructive in me, I give up.

00:19:32.306 --> 00:19:35.870
Nobody has to tell me.

00:19:36.071 --> 00:19:41.702
Such a state of righteousness, you have within yourself,

00:19:42.167 --> 00:19:45.633
which is manifested.

00:19:45.834 --> 00:19:50.056
And then you come to know that all the religions were born

00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:55.402
as beautiful flowers on the same tree of spirituality.

00:19:55.603 --> 00:20:01.797
We pluck the flowers and we are fighting with the dead flowers.

00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:09.606
Thus, you transcend all these
limitations of racialism, of communalism,

00:20:09.807 --> 00:20:15.141
of all kinds of nonsense that we have been adhering to.

00:20:16.016 --> 00:20:20.156
All this is your own.

00:20:20.357 --> 00:20:27.105
Tonight, you all can get your enlightenment.

00:20:27.306 --> 00:20:34.861
You all can feel the all-pervading power of divine love.

00:20:35.651 --> 00:20:42.777
Only thing you have to have the pure desire

00:20:42.978 --> 00:20:48.061
and full confidence in yourself.

00:20:48.979 --> 00:20:53.130
Of course, I cannot force it on you.

00:20:53.331 --> 00:20:58.322
I respect your freedom as human beings.

00:20:58.523 --> 00:21:04.368
If you don’t want to have, you can leave the hall.

00:21:04.569 --> 00:21:09.269
It will hardly take 10-15 minutes.

00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:15.868
I know the people here are seekers, earnest seekers.

00:21:16.069 --> 00:21:22.310
And is your right to have your ascent.

00:21:22.511 --> 00:21:30.755
Firstly, this Kundalini is your own
mother, is your individual mother.

00:21:30.956 --> 00:21:34.881
She knows all about you.

00:21:35.082 --> 00:21:41.858
She knows what mistakes you have committed and also she knows your aspirations.

00:21:42.771 --> 00:21:47.739
And she is very anxious to give you your second birth.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:54.856
So, you don’t have to worry about
yourself, please don’t judge yourself.

00:21:55.230 --> 00:21:58.449
Let her judge.

00:21:58.819 --> 00:22:03.326
So, you should be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:22:03.527 --> 00:22:13.952
So, the first and the foremost thing
we should have is self-confidence.

00:22:14.342 --> 00:22:19.535
And should not feel guilty about anything.

00:22:19.736 --> 00:22:23.363
This guilt is a horrible thing.

00:22:23.564 --> 00:22:25.807
This creates a problem on the left-hand side here

00:22:26.008 --> 00:22:33.237
on the left centre [showing left vishuddhi] and can give you lots of troubles.

00:22:33.438 --> 00:22:39.100
It gives you spondylitis, angina,

00:22:39.301 --> 00:22:43.752
it gives you lethargic organs,

00:22:43.953 --> 00:22:48.721
diseases like tuberculosis.

00:22:48.922 --> 00:22:52.674
So, why to have guilt?

00:22:52.875 --> 00:22:57.944
Whatever was wrong in the past is over now, finished.

00:22:58.145 --> 00:23:02.796
We are talking about the present.

00:23:02.997 --> 00:23:07.113
Please don’t feel guilty.

00:23:07.314 --> 00:23:16.097
Because if this centre is in problem,
the Kundalini won’t pass through.

00:23:16.837 --> 00:23:22.124
As I love you, you have to love yourself.

00:23:22.882 --> 00:23:27.238
Then another condition is that, you should not,

00:23:27.439 --> 00:23:33.738
you should forgive everyone.

00:23:34.696 --> 00:23:39.325
Some people think it is difficult.

00:23:39.526 --> 00:23:45.545
But logically, whether you forgive or
don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

00:23:45.746 --> 00:23:50.121
But if you don’t forgive, then you torture yourself

00:23:50.322 --> 00:23:54.840
and play into wrong hands.

00:23:55.058 --> 00:24:00.158
But at this moment, it is very important to forgive.

00:24:00.359 --> 00:24:06.821
Because the centre at the optic chiasma
is constricted like this, like a cross.

00:24:07.022 --> 00:24:12.771
And if you don’t forgive, it won’t open like this [shows square-shaped opening with fingers].

00:24:12.972 --> 00:24:20.365
And at this important moment, Kundalini cannot pass through.

00:24:20.566 --> 00:24:27.967
As it is, you have tortured yourself
with this myth of not forgiving.

00:24:28.497 --> 00:24:34.301
And at this moment, you should not miss

00:24:34.501 --> 00:24:40.698
this great important thing of your life, is enlightenment.

00:24:40.899 --> 00:24:46.040
Also, you need not think about people whom you have to forgive

00:24:46.352 --> 00:24:50.191
because it’s a headache.

00:24:50.392 --> 00:24:55.473
In general, you have to forgive everyone.

00:24:56.279 --> 00:25:03.653
The third condition is that you have to take out your shoes.

00:25:03.854 --> 00:25:08.073
I know it is very simple

00:25:09.081 --> 00:25:11.776
but in London, first time when I had a program,

00:25:11.977 --> 00:25:19.924
I asked them they have to take their shoes,
they walked out of the hall, half of them.

00:25:21.348 --> 00:25:26.140
So, Sahaja Yoga is not meant for stupid people.

00:25:26.341 --> 00:25:31.863
Is not meant for idiots, I should say.

00:25:32.064 --> 00:25:36.751
Also, it is not meant for arrogant people.

00:25:36.952 --> 00:25:41.294
You have to ask for your self-realisation,

00:25:41.494 --> 00:25:45.931
otherwise I cannot force it on you.

00:25:46.132 --> 00:25:52.252
But firstly, you should be humble.

00:25:55.112 --> 00:25:59.777
With so little advertisement and everything,

00:25:59.978 --> 00:26:06.402
so many of you have come, it’s very encouraging for all of us.

00:26:06.603 --> 00:26:13.643
You will get your sprouting, I would say, like a seed sprouts.

00:26:13.844 --> 00:26:17.884
Because it is all built-in within you.

00:26:18.085 --> 00:26:22.823
But it is a collective happening.

00:26:23.024 --> 00:26:28.741
You cannot be working it out in your homes and houses,

00:26:28.942 --> 00:26:33.192
you have to come to the collective to grow.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:39.731
What surprises me that when I go to any country,

00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:45.119
there are thousands who come.

00:26:46.187 --> 00:26:48.619
I don’t know how they have so much trust in Me,

00:26:48.820 --> 00:26:52.586
I am a foreigner for you.

00:26:53.354 --> 00:27:00.499
But later on, they don’t trust their
own people who are here to help you.

00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:04.615
They can help you to grow.

00:27:04.820 --> 00:27:09.273
Because after this, who is the other?

00:27:09.474 --> 00:27:13.178
Who is the other?

00:27:13.888 --> 00:27:19.026
You become collectively conscious.

00:27:20.066 --> 00:27:24.223
The microcosm becomes macrocosm.

00:27:24.424 --> 00:27:28.100
A drop becomes the ocean.

00:27:28.301 --> 00:27:34.569
Such love, such friendship, such pure relationship

00:27:34.770 --> 00:27:41.254
develops that our society improves tremendously.

00:27:42.382 --> 00:27:51.678
There’s a lot to be said but I think first let us have our enlightenment.

00:27:51.879 --> 00:27:54.660
There are so many lights here,

00:27:54.861 --> 00:27:59.410
you have to just switch on and they come out

00:27:59.611 --> 00:28:03.865
because it is already built in.

00:28:04.066 --> 00:28:07.279
If I have to tell, you all the history of electricity

00:28:07.487 --> 00:28:12.432
and how it was brought here, you will be bored stiff.

00:28:12.633 --> 00:28:18.278
So, is better to put the lights on first.

00:28:27.704 --> 00:28:31.495
Now, it’s very simple as I told you.

00:28:31.696 --> 00:28:37.767
I am happy you all have taken out your shoes without any grudges.

00:28:40.259 --> 00:28:45.129
You should be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:28:45.330 --> 00:28:51.775
As I have told you, you don’t have to do anything, it’s spontaneous.

00:28:51.976 --> 00:28:55.768
Only for tonight, you’ll have to nourish your centres

00:28:55.969 --> 00:29:01.948
with your self-confidence which I’ll tell you how to do it.
