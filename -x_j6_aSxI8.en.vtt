00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.560
My joy knows no bounds

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:21.920
when we have come to worship this holy mountain,

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.880
which we have named as Ganaraj.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:04.360
Sometimes the words are not sufficient

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.720
to hold the outpour of your joy.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.960
I come to you as a symbol of your Mother,

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:40.160
but the first son who was created was Shri Ganesha.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:50.600
And then, when the Mother Earth was created

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.280
as a symbol of motherhood,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:00.120
She created many Shri Ganeshas in this universe.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:30.400
In the cosmos, the star which is called as Mars, is the Ganesh,

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.560
All these symbols were created for you the Sahaja Yogis

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.960
to recognize them;

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:03.560
to recognize all these symbols is easier

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.640
if you are a realized soul.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.640
But we have had

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:23.200
so many great realized souls in the past,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.800
of very high quality,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.080
and they recognized,

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.760
they found out the symbols of Shri Ganesha long time back.

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:56.200
India is the microscopic form of the whole earth, Mother Earth.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:10.840
So, in the triangle of Maharashtra we have got eight Ganeshas

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.400
which are manifesting vibrations,

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.720
and were recognized by great Saints of Maharashtra.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.960
But, as you have seen, as a grace of these great Saints,

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.560
specially Maharashtra has created human beings

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.040
who have shraddha

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.920
as the highest expression of their emotion and mind.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:13.400
Because of that lofty vision in the mind,

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.600
whenever they see something of this sublime nature,

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.560
their thoughts go to God.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.160
Thanks to the Saints of that state

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:48.440
that people have that sensitivity and that kind of a movement.

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.080
Today, in the Presence of Shri Ganesha,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.240
you have to take an oath that,

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.040
"Whatever is the past of my country,

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:14.560
I will get opposite to that."

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.880
Like I would say Indians are not very good with the money;

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.360
money matters they can be very horrid,

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.280
and sometimes they create a problem with money matters.

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.520
So, one has to know that we have to be absolutely astute

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.600
as far as money is concerned.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:01.640
It is not sufficient only to be something innocent,

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.800
but it is more that it should be proved,

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.320
that people should know that you are innocent!

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.120
Like I asked My son-in law, he is a very honest man,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:24.240
whether this would be honesty,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:31.040
so he answered, "This may be honesty for outside purpose,

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.840
but it is not in the essence of honesty."

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:53.920
So, that is how you have to be honest, in the essence of it,

00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:00.920
and the essence of honesty is innocence.

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.920
Essence of sincerity is innocence.

00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.880
Essence of beauty, glory, is innocence,

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:21.720
and innocence is the one that gives you complete detachment.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:27.400
So, to such a symbol of innocence, when we bow,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:31.800
we must know what we have done about ourselves.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.200
Whatever has been your past, get out of it.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:52.000
Be just the opposite of what has been so bad before.

00:08:56.200 --> 00:09:01.800
Strongly against all that you were before, in the darkness.

00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:09.560
That is the sign of your character,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.920
and of your strength,

00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:18.400
and will show to the world that your Spirit,

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:20.840
which is enlightened within you, has given you

00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:27.160
that strength and that new dimension.

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.480
So the second oath we have to take before Shri Ganesha is

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:43.760
that, "I will be honest to myself.

00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:56.480
I will not deceive myself for anybody's sake."

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:04.080
Now the third great thing about Shri Ganesha is

00:10:04.120 --> 00:10:09.800
that for Him no Gods exist except His Mother.

00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.360
And you know all the stories about Shri Ganesha,

00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.920
how He adored His Mother,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:34.240
because He knows His Mother is the Power;

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:41.640
and that He is the source of your wisdom,

00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:55.800
He's the embodiment of wisdom,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.400
and the greatest wisdom He has:

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:02.600
that it is better to worship the Mother

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.960
than anybody else, because She is the Power.

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.120
According to Him, even the Father, if you have to meet,

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.160
you have to go through the Mother,

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.040
and secondly Father is just the Witness.

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.880
All His security, all His powers,

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:40.680
all His beauty, innocence, comes from His Mother.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.360
So with the third oath you have to take

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.840
that, "For us, our Mother is so powerful,

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:58.280
why should we be afraid of anything?

00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:11.080
If She is going to give us the wisdom,

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:14.920
why should we try to seek it anywhere else?"

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:27.280
I appear very innocent sometimes,

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:35.080
but My innocence is complete intelligence, I think,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:59.000
and that is the reason, you see, people take time to accept.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:05.880
But people like Shri Ganesh

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.000
who are the wisest of all, know the trick.

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.440
The another oath we have to take today

00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:26.680
that, ’’We'll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart,

00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:33.200
because they are made in the form of Shri Ganesha.

00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:48.320
We'll not make fun of them,

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:51.600
we'll not laugh at them’,

00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:56.800
as long as they are in Sahaja Yoga we have to respect.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:02.120
But they can be thrown away,

00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:06.240
they can get out of it.

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:10.040
But unless and until this happens,

00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:17.400
do not put your ego on other people.

00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.760
Don't think that you understand everything.

00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.440
Don't think that you know everything.

00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:36.160
Respect each and every person,

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.760
not for what he has read or what he has learnt,

00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.920
but because he is a great soul.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:58.400
I feel the whole West suffers from one, one simple disease,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.720
that is, they do not know how to respect anyone.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:12.080
Whatever doesn't suit their mind,

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:14.840
they will never accept nor will respect.

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:25.560
With their ego they want to judge everyone and condemn everyone.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.360
So, get out of it,

00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:36.000
and tell yourself, "I don't know anything.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:43.480
I was a stupid fool with my ego."

00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:48.880
Humble down yourself in your heart,

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:51.760
open your heart,

00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.640
and love each other.

00:15:58.680 --> 00:16:01.960
Respect and love

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:06.960
is the two things you have to promise to Shri Ganesha.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:15.760
If you cannot do that, your ascent is going to be very difficult.

00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:22.760
May God bless you!
