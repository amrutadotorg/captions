WEBVTT

00:07.960 --> 00:12.560
My joy knows no bounds

00:12.600 --> 00:21.920
when we have come to worship this holy mountain,

00:21.960 --> 00:25.880
which we have named as Ganaraj.

00:59.240 --> 01:04.360
Sometimes the words are not sufficient

01:04.400 --> 01:09.720
to hold the outpour of your joy.

01:19.560 --> 01:28.960
I come to you as a symbol of your Mother,

01:34.080 --> 01:40.160
but the first son who was created was Shri Ganesha.

01:45.480 --> 01:50.600
And then, when the Mother Earth was created

01:50.640 --> 01:53.280
as a symbol of motherhood,

01:53.320 --> 02:00.120
She created many Shri Ganeshas in this universe.

02:11.840 --> 02:30.400
In the cosmos, the star which is called as Mars, is the Ganesh,

02:39.480 --> 02:44.560
All these symbols were created for you the Sahaja Yogis

02:44.600 --> 02:47.960
to recognize them;

02:56.200 --> 03:03.560
to recognize all these symbols is easier

03:03.600 --> 03:07.640
if you are a realized soul.

03:13.280 --> 03:15.640
But we have had

03:15.680 --> 03:23.200
so many great realized souls in the past,

03:28.240 --> 03:31.800
of very high quality,

03:31.840 --> 03:35.080
and they recognized,

03:35.120 --> 03:41.760
they found out the symbols of Shri Ganesha long time back.

03:49.760 --> 03:56.200
India is the microscopic form of the whole earth, Mother Earth.

04:05.040 --> 04:10.840
So, in the triangle of Maharashtra we have got eight Ganeshas

04:10.880 --> 04:15.400
which are manifesting vibrations,

04:15.440 --> 04:20.720
and were recognized by great Saints of Maharashtra.

04:34.960 --> 04:39.960
But, as you have seen, as a grace of these great Saints,

04:40.000 --> 04:45.560
specially Maharashtra has created human beings

04:45.600 --> 04:48.040
who have shraddha

04:48.080 --> 04:54.920
as the highest expression of their emotion and mind.

05:07.720 --> 05:13.400
Because of that lofty vision in the mind,

05:13.400 --> 05:19.600
whenever they see something of this sublime nature,

05:19.640 --> 05:23.560
their thoughts go to God.

05:36.600 --> 05:40.160
Thanks to the Saints of that state

05:40.200 --> 05:48.440
that people have that sensitivity and that kind of a movement.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.080
Today, in the Presence of Shri Ganesha,

06:05.120 --> 06:07.240
you have to take an oath that,

06:07.280 --> 06:10.040
"Whatever is the past of my country,

06:10.080 --> 06:14.560
I will get opposite to that."

06:28.720 --> 06:32.880
Like I would say Indians are not very good with the money;

06:32.920 --> 06:35.360
money matters they can be very horrid,

06:35.400 --> 06:40.280
and sometimes they create a problem with money matters.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.520
So, one has to know that we have to be absolutely astute

06:43.560 --> 06:46.600
as far as money is concerned.

06:55.320 --> 07:01.640
It is not sufficient only to be something innocent,

07:01.680 --> 07:04.800
but it is more that it should be proved,

07:04.840 --> 07:09.320
that people should know that you are innocent!

07:18.120 --> 07:21.120
Like I asked My son-in law, he is a very honest man,

07:21.160 --> 07:24.240
whether this would be honesty,

07:25.320 --> 07:31.040
so he answered, "This may be honesty for outside purpose,

07:31.080 --> 07:34.840
but it is not in the essence of honesty."

07:47.840 --> 07:53.920
So, that is how you have to be honest, in the essence of it,

07:55.920 --> 08:00.920
and the essence of honesty is innocence.

08:02.360 --> 08:06.920
Essence of sincerity is innocence.

08:06.960 --> 08:11.880
Essence of beauty, glory, is innocence,

08:14.360 --> 08:21.720
and innocence is the one that gives you complete detachment.

08:24.040 --> 08:27.400
So, to such a symbol of innocence, when we bow,

08:27.440 --> 08:31.800
we must know what we have done about ourselves.

08:37.560 --> 08:43.200
Whatever has been your past, get out of it.

08:46.680 --> 08:52.000
Be just the opposite of what has been so bad before.

08:56.200 --> 09:01.800
Strongly against all that you were before, in the darkness.

09:05.960 --> 09:09.560
That is the sign of your character,

09:12.080 --> 09:14.920
and of your strength,

09:14.960 --> 09:18.400
and will show to the world that your Spirit,

09:18.440 --> 09:20.840
which is enlightened within you, has given you

09:20.880 --> 09:27.160
that strength and that new dimension.

09:34.800 --> 09:39.480
So the second oath we have to take before Shri Ganesha is

09:39.520 --> 09:43.760
that, "I will be honest to myself.

09:51.640 --> 09:56.480
I will not deceive myself for anybody's sake."

10:00.080 --> 10:04.080
Now the third great thing about Shri Ganesha is

10:04.120 --> 10:09.800
that for Him no Gods exist except His Mother.

10:17.440 --> 10:20.360
And you know all the stories about Shri Ganesha,

10:20.400 --> 10:23.920
how He adored His Mother,

10:29.160 --> 10:34.240
because He knows His Mother is the Power;

10:36.960 --> 10:41.640
and that He is the source of your wisdom,

10:52.080 --> 10:55.800
He's the embodiment of wisdom,

10:58.320 --> 11:00.400
and the greatest wisdom He has:

11:00.440 --> 11:02.600
that it is better to worship the Mother

11:02.640 --> 11:06.960
than anybody else, because She is the Power.

11:15.000 --> 11:18.120
According to Him, even the Father, if you have to meet,

11:18.160 --> 11:20.160
you have to go through the Mother,

11:20.200 --> 11:24.040
and secondly Father is just the Witness.

11:33.120 --> 11:35.880
All His security, all His powers,

11:35.920 --> 11:40.680
all His beauty, innocence, comes from His Mother.

11:47.160 --> 11:50.360
So with the third oath you have to take

11:50.400 --> 11:53.840
that, "For us, our Mother is so powerful,

11:53.880 --> 11:58.280
why should we be afraid of anything?

12:08.280 --> 12:11.080
If She is going to give us the wisdom,

12:11.120 --> 12:14.920
why should we try to seek it anywhere else?"

12:22.200 --> 12:27.280
I appear very innocent sometimes,

12:29.160 --> 12:35.080
but My innocence is complete intelligence, I think,

12:51.960 --> 12:59.000
and that is the reason, you see, people take time to accept.

13:02.600 --> 13:05.880
But people like Shri Ganesh

13:05.920 --> 13:11.000
who are the wisest of all, know the trick.

13:18.960 --> 13:22.440
The another oath we have to take today

13:22.480 --> 13:26.680
that, ’’We'll respect every Sahaja Yogi from our heart,

13:26.760 --> 13:33.200
because they are made in the form of Shri Ganesha.

13:44.360 --> 13:48.320
We'll not make fun of them,

13:48.400 --> 13:51.600
we'll not laugh at them’,

13:51.720 --> 13:56.800
as long as they are in Sahaja Yoga we have to respect.

13:58.120 --> 14:02.120
But they can be thrown away,

14:02.840 --> 14:06.240
they can get out of it.

14:06.640 --> 14:10.040
But unless and until this happens,

14:11.480 --> 14:17.400
do not put your ego on other people.

14:20.640 --> 14:24.760
Don't think that you understand everything.

14:27.400 --> 14:31.440
Don't think that you know everything.

14:32.040 --> 14:36.160
Respect each and every person,

14:37.240 --> 14:40.760
not for what he has read or what he has learnt,

14:40.800 --> 14:44.920
but because he is a great soul.

14:53.960 --> 14:58.400
I feel the whole West suffers from one, one simple disease,

14:58.440 --> 15:02.720
that is, they do not know how to respect anyone.

15:08.520 --> 15:12.080
Whatever doesn't suit their mind,

15:12.120 --> 15:14.840
they will never accept nor will respect.

15:20.040 --> 15:25.560
With their ego they want to judge everyone and condemn everyone.

15:27.560 --> 15:31.360
So, get out of it,

15:32.040 --> 15:36.000
and tell yourself, "I don't know anything.

15:40.040 --> 15:43.480
I was a stupid fool with my ego."

15:45.760 --> 15:48.880
Humble down yourself in your heart,

15:48.920 --> 15:51.760
open your heart,

15:55.160 --> 15:58.640
and love each other.

15:58.680 --> 16:01.960
Respect and love

16:01.960 --> 16:06.960
is the two things you have to promise to Shri Ganesha.

16:10.320 --> 16:15.760
If you cannot do that, your ascent is going to be very difficult.

16:19.240 --> 16:22.760
May God bless you!
