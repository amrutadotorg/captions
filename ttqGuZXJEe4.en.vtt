00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:28.832
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Ganesha
Puja.

00:01:38.485 --> 00:01:54.194
The first deity that was created by the Adi
Shakti was Shri Ganesh because it was necessary

00:01:54.194 --> 00:02:19.805
first to create the deity of principles - the
deity of principle in the sense that whatever

00:02:19.805 --> 00:02:36.445
is created, whatever is there as called "bhava,"
whatever has been so far created up to human

00:02:36.445 --> 00:02:37.775
level.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:56.726
Everything had to be through the implanted
mechanism of energy, otherwise nothing could

00:02:56.726 --> 00:03:03.394
have been created.

00:03:03.394 --> 00:03:14.135
If you go into the matter, say sulphur dioxide,
then sulphur and oxide - go on deep into it

00:03:14.135 --> 00:03:23.935
till you reach the state when it is a molecule
- then you see these atoms of sulphur and

00:03:23.935 --> 00:03:28.485
oxygen, they oscillate.

00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:34.885
They oscillate with a frequency.

00:03:34.885 --> 00:03:39.254
There are three types of frequencies they
use.

00:03:39.254 --> 00:03:50.725
Now imagine in the molecule, think of it,
in the molecule of a substance there is an

00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:55.715
energy which is acting.

00:03:55.715 --> 00:04:02.015
Now one may say that, "Why should be in matter
there is energy?"

00:04:02.015 --> 00:04:14.835
One can ask a question: "Why there should
be energy in matter?"

00:04:14.835 --> 00:04:25.875
If there was no energy in the matter, how
can you have all chemical compounds?

00:04:25.875 --> 00:04:27.975
Who pushes them?

00:04:27.975 --> 00:04:32.765
Say, you have sodium chloride.

00:04:32.765 --> 00:04:38.405
Sodium and chloride are attached to each other,
but if the chloride has to go to some other

00:04:38.405 --> 00:04:45.135
atom, then who does that?

00:04:45.135 --> 00:05:01.415
There has to be some energy which is absolutely
inbuilt into matter.

00:05:01.415 --> 00:05:15.935
Now, we may say that, "What about water?"

00:05:15.935 --> 00:05:18.775
You know water has energy.

00:05:18.775 --> 00:05:20.655
That's how we have hydrostatics.

00:05:20.655 --> 00:05:37.525
Even coal, even stones, all of them have got
energy within themselves and it is all controlled

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:40.475
by the principle of Shri Ganesha.

00:05:40.475 --> 00:05:51.915
So, though He's such a small, little, tiny,
little child, how great is His work and how

00:05:51.915 --> 00:05:53.605
much He has to work out.

00:05:53.605 --> 00:06:02.795
Now from matter, you move, say, to living
plants, then to animals, then to human beings

00:06:02.795 --> 00:06:04.625
and everywhere His energy works.

00:06:04.625 --> 00:06:15.055
At the level of matter, they might call it
electromagnetic, but potentially it is the

00:06:15.055 --> 00:06:21.075
energy of Shri Ganesh, which is electromagnetic
at that point.

00:06:21.075 --> 00:06:26.175
Then it starts evolving, growing.

00:06:26.175 --> 00:06:44.435
That's how we have different stratas of energies
that we see in different growth of the evolution.

00:06:44.435 --> 00:07:03.955
In the human being it exists, as you know,
as auspiciousness, as purity, mainly the innocence.

00:07:03.955 --> 00:07:13.595
So the power of innocence is such a guiding
factor.

00:07:13.595 --> 00:07:18.105
There's a difference between ignorance and
innocence.

00:07:18.105 --> 00:07:36.035
If you are innocent, then to you nothing is
important except for love.

00:07:36.035 --> 00:07:46.655
For an innocent person who is not conditioned,
who is not egoistical, who is not so-called

00:07:46.655 --> 00:07:54.545
mature, it is the love that it understands.

00:07:54.545 --> 00:08:12.975
It doesn't care for any wealth, any power,
anything; but the love that it can feel, the

00:08:12.975 --> 00:08:18.605
pure love of a person.

00:08:18.605 --> 00:08:31.625
Innocent person has no understanding of gaining
anything out of the love he receives or he

00:08:31.625 --> 00:08:36.425
gives, no sense at all.

00:08:36.425 --> 00:08:42.745
Innocence is the basis of all the dharmas.

00:08:42.745 --> 00:08:56.405
If you have no innocence you cannot follow
dharma because if you are dharmic, it is maybe

00:08:56.405 --> 00:09:05.215
your mental attitude, maybe egoistical, maybe
because you are born in a religion, because

00:09:05.215 --> 00:09:07.645
somebody has told you about it.

00:09:07.645 --> 00:09:13.005
It's going to be very superficial.

00:09:13.005 --> 00:09:22.895
Unless and until it is embedded in the quality
of innocence, dharma has no meaning.

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:26.705
In that state you are dharmic.

00:09:26.705 --> 00:09:36.345
You are beyond any thinking about it, of any
deductions about it, but you are dharmic.

00:09:36.345 --> 00:09:37.955
You cannot be adharmi.

00:09:37.955 --> 00:09:50.265
You cannot be - as if the manifestation of
innocence is morality.

00:09:50.265 --> 00:09:59.365
Once Shri Ganesha is awakened - I hope He
has been awakened in all of you - and if you

00:09:59.365 --> 00:10:11.855
respect Him, just respect Him, then automatically
you develop a sense of morality.

00:10:11.855 --> 00:10:14.325
I don't have to tell you.

00:10:14.325 --> 00:10:16.785
I don't have to explain to you.

00:10:16.785 --> 00:10:22.245
You just become moral.

00:10:22.245 --> 00:10:29.215
People who have seen you are quite amazed
and said that, "How is it that their eyes

00:10:29.215 --> 00:10:36.015
are fixed, so innocent, without any lust and
greed?"

00:10:36.015 --> 00:10:48.075
Is the light of Shri Ganesha from the back
Agnya; front Agnya is Jesus Christ Who is

00:10:48.075 --> 00:10:56.245
the manifestation of Shri Ganesha.

00:10:56.245 --> 00:11:01.845
It is impossible for western mind to understand
that Jesus Christ was purity.

00:11:01.845 --> 00:11:09.655
They can't understand, and they have criticized
Him and said horrible things against.

00:11:09.655 --> 00:11:23.695
Somehow He's forgiving them, but one thing
about Shri Ganesh is that, that He worships

00:11:23.695 --> 00:11:26.025
His Mother.

00:11:26.025 --> 00:11:32.235
Motherhood is very important.

00:11:32.235 --> 00:11:47.175
Motherhood in the women, motherhood in the
father and also in the children has to be

00:11:47.175 --> 00:11:59.245
accepted as the mainstay of family life and
society.

00:11:59.245 --> 00:12:14.805
The ordinary life of a human being - very
simple, innocent, simple people - revolves

00:12:14.805 --> 00:12:18.755
around the mother.

00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:24.115
It revolves, but the mothers have to be mothers.

00:12:24.115 --> 00:12:40.605
As Shri Ganesha is so much surrendered to
His Mother and who is His Mother?

00:12:40.605 --> 00:12:42.395
Is Adi Shakti.

00:12:42.395 --> 00:12:50.675
He does not know anybody else, just knows
His Mother.

00:12:50.675 --> 00:13:02.115
This is extremely important in Sahaj Yoga.

00:13:02.115 --> 00:13:13.345
As we say, there is immoral human beings,
there are.

00:13:13.345 --> 00:13:29.985
They're doing immoral things because they're
committing sin against the Adi Shakti; committing

00:13:29.985 --> 00:13:36.625
sin against Ganesha.

00:13:36.625 --> 00:13:49.214
It may be forgiven, but committing sin against
the Adi Shakti, it encompasses a very big

00:13:49.214 --> 00:14:05.165
area where we start seeing how we are committing
the sin against the Adi Shakti which, ultimately,

00:14:05.165 --> 00:14:07.855
Shri Ganesha punishes - ultimately.

00:14:07.855 --> 00:14:21.455
Actually, the Adi Shakti doesn't punish anyone,
the deities only punish them.

00:14:21.455 --> 00:14:36.945
First and foremost thing that is to be understood,
that innocence should be respected, looked

00:14:36.945 --> 00:14:44.565
after, nourished and protected.

00:14:44.565 --> 00:14:50.584
That's why I'm very particular about the children.

00:14:50.584 --> 00:14:55.505
Children should not be exposed to the public.

00:14:55.505 --> 00:15:02.834
We should not try to make photographs out
of our children and expose them in the newspaper

00:15:02.834 --> 00:15:07.295
or give them for advertisement or anything
there.

00:15:07.295 --> 00:15:24.115
Is a very wrong idea to expose your children
to gain some money out of them in any way,

00:15:24.115 --> 00:15:31.834
in the smallest way also, because we are selling
the innocence, the innocence which is invaluable,

00:15:31.834 --> 00:15:38.435
writ large on the children.

00:15:38.435 --> 00:15:44.964
Many children I know who have been advertised
and all that, specially in India, have died.

00:15:44.964 --> 00:15:55.655
Also we have to look after our children with
great care.

00:15:55.655 --> 00:16:00.365
But we go to two extremes, I have seen.

00:16:00.365 --> 00:16:02.515
Some people are only worried about their own
children.

00:16:02.515 --> 00:16:09.115
If anything happens to them, just get upset.

00:16:09.115 --> 00:16:13.505
That means you are respecting your child because
he's your child.

00:16:13.505 --> 00:16:19.885
But if you are respecting him because he carries
innocence with him, then you have to respect

00:16:19.885 --> 00:16:29.705
every child and understand every child - what
they talk, what they say, how they behave.

00:16:29.705 --> 00:16:32.905
Luckily, you all have got children now who
are born-realized.

00:16:32.905 --> 00:16:38.195
It's such a great thing, such a blessing.

00:16:38.195 --> 00:16:43.285
So on one side, we have to see how innocent
they are and how they talk.

00:16:43.285 --> 00:16:46.205
I'll give you an example.

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:53.935
Bogdan - no, this Wolfgang was very serious
and his wife told Me that, "We were taking

00:16:53.935 --> 00:16:59.935
him to the hospital, so this doctor says,
'Why are you taking him to the hospital?

00:16:59.935 --> 00:17:02.555
There are no Sahaja Yogis there.

00:17:02.555 --> 00:17:06.455
How will they correct his chakras?'"

00:17:06.455 --> 00:17:09.014
Innocently said the correct thing and they
couldn't do.

00:17:09.014 --> 00:17:10.065
Doctors didn't do anything.

00:17:10.065 --> 00:17:13.315
I had to cure him.

00:17:13.315 --> 00:17:14.874
"Take him to Mother.

00:17:14.874 --> 00:17:17.884
Why are you taking him to the hospital?"

00:17:17.884 --> 00:17:25.535
They see the right point and say the right
thing because they're innocent and innocence

00:17:25.535 --> 00:17:33.825
means they have pure attention - pure attention
for anything you need.

00:17:33.825 --> 00:17:43.385
Say, music, for art, for anything you have
to have pure attention and that comes through

00:17:43.385 --> 00:17:45.545
your innocence.

00:17:45.545 --> 00:17:52.325
Say a person who is an artist and who is very
money-oriented, say for example, a person

00:17:52.325 --> 00:17:55.464
who is doing some paintings and all that.

00:17:55.464 --> 00:17:59.494
His art cannot become eternal art.

00:17:59.494 --> 00:18:00.494
Cannot.

00:18:00.494 --> 00:18:05.184
That's why we see in modern times whatever
art is created, it just comes and goes.

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:09.244
It has no eternal value.

00:18:09.244 --> 00:18:11.854
Same with the modern music that they're having.

00:18:11.854 --> 00:18:13.385
The same thing is happening.

00:18:13.385 --> 00:18:22.265
It comes and goes and no one knows where it
has disappeared.

00:18:22.265 --> 00:18:34.796
Behind it is money orientation, and that money
orientation results into a kind of a creation

00:18:34.796 --> 00:18:41.035
which is not perfect.

00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:50.035
All creations which were dedicated to God
in the olden times are being today very much

00:18:50.035 --> 00:18:52.785
respected and people pay a lot of money for
that.

00:18:52.785 --> 00:18:59.224
Maybe, at that time, the artists must have
suffered; but they understood, innocent artists

00:18:59.224 --> 00:19:10.545
understood, very much that if we have to express,
we must truthfully do it, not to please, not

00:19:10.545 --> 00:19:15.915
to please the people, not to please anyone,
but to please God.

00:19:15.915 --> 00:19:22.924
As you know that Michelangelo had a big fight
with this pope here because he couldn't tolerate

00:19:22.924 --> 00:19:26.125
nonsense that was coming from the pope.

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:31.335
All the artists always have been fighting
- real artists.

00:19:31.335 --> 00:19:36.595
So this innocence also gives you a power of
self-understanding.

00:19:36.595 --> 00:19:42.465
You know where you stand.

00:19:42.465 --> 00:19:52.224
A person who is innocent knows very well that
he is standing on the pedestal of virtues.

00:19:52.224 --> 00:19:59.734
He should not give in to all kinds of nonsensical
things which are very popular, may be fashionable,

00:19:59.734 --> 00:20:00.734
may be accepted.

00:20:00.734 --> 00:20:05.104
For what?

00:20:05.104 --> 00:20:09.584
For what are we going to sacrifice our innocence?

00:20:09.584 --> 00:20:14.045
What is our gain?

00:20:14.045 --> 00:20:20.045
May be some people are too brilliant and they
may try to show off with their brilliance

00:20:20.045 --> 00:20:26.734
for a short time, but they don't remain in
the eternal history.

00:20:26.734 --> 00:20:36.464
They go as egoistical people or as very dishonest
people.

00:20:36.464 --> 00:20:39.854
Nobody respects them.

00:20:39.854 --> 00:20:51.594
So there is a big attack on the innocence
of people.

00:20:51.594 --> 00:20:54.074
Big attack.

00:20:54.074 --> 00:20:55.545
First it comes from children.

00:20:55.545 --> 00:21:01.834
As you see, this nonsense that is going on
which we hear about - I mean, I can't even

00:21:01.834 --> 00:21:04.665
understand why they do it.

00:21:04.665 --> 00:21:11.685
They do it on children, these funny attacks
of abuses.

00:21:11.685 --> 00:21:18.395
It's just because they want to kill the innocence.

00:21:18.395 --> 00:21:24.785
Perhaps those who do it have no innocence
in them, and they don't want the children

00:21:24.785 --> 00:21:27.905
to have any innocence left in them.

00:21:27.905 --> 00:21:32.074
Otherwise, in India is something we can't
understand.

00:21:32.074 --> 00:21:38.824
Really, we can't understand; but it is becoming
much more prevalent, much more fashionable

00:21:38.824 --> 00:21:50.905
now because there is definitely an attack
on innocence, not only on children, but even

00:21:50.905 --> 00:21:54.464
on people who are innocent.

00:21:54.464 --> 00:22:05.954
Because those who have deliberations in criminality,
in all kinds of sinful act will never, never

00:22:05.954 --> 00:22:08.094
try to protect innocence.

00:22:08.094 --> 00:22:13.525
Never, because juxtaposition is there.

00:22:13.525 --> 00:22:17.864
They are doing something which they think
is the best.

00:22:17.864 --> 00:22:22.294
I don't know if they think that way, but I
don't know what justifies their behavior like

00:22:22.294 --> 00:22:29.165
this is to attack the innocence of children.

00:22:29.165 --> 00:22:34.805
In so many ways, you'll find this innocence
is being attacked.

00:22:34.805 --> 00:22:42.555
If your children are doing well, if they are
studying well, somebody might try to catch

00:22:42.555 --> 00:22:45.275
hold of them.

00:22:45.275 --> 00:22:55.824
If some person they find is an innocent person,
they will try to put him into trouble.

00:22:55.824 --> 00:23:03.854
The innocence is sort of - is, itself, is
such a power that it challenges the hatred,

00:23:03.854 --> 00:23:09.944
the abusive nature of people.

00:23:09.944 --> 00:23:22.395
First of all, we should see that how our conditioning
takes over our innocence.

00:23:22.395 --> 00:23:23.905
It makes you extremely ritualistic.

00:23:23.905 --> 00:23:31.574
Even in Sahaja Yoga, I've seen, I've heard
also, that people are extremely, extremely

00:23:31.574 --> 00:23:47.905
ritualistic.

00:23:47.905 --> 00:23:55.035
Now the ritualism is like this: that you have
to say something three times, you say it three

00:23:55.035 --> 00:23:59.295
times, seven times like tied up people.

00:23:59.295 --> 00:24:09.795
I've seen some Sahaja Yogis like that; and
some Sahaj Yogis, I think they must be bhootish,

00:24:09.795 --> 00:24:11.635
get frightened with Me.

00:24:11.635 --> 00:24:13.434
What is there to be frightened of Me?

00:24:13.434 --> 00:24:18.535
Because they're bhootish, they are getting
frightened.

00:24:18.535 --> 00:24:21.604
Otherwise, why should you?

00:24:21.604 --> 00:24:30.344
I love you all and you won't find more, a
greater, mild Guru than Myself.

00:24:30.344 --> 00:24:36.214
I don't think so, but they're afraid.

00:24:36.214 --> 00:24:38.574
Even if you look at them, they'll not smile.

00:24:38.574 --> 00:24:39.724
They'll be afraid.

00:24:39.724 --> 00:24:40.994
What wrong have you done?

00:24:40.994 --> 00:24:43.984
You have become Sahaja Yogis.

00:24:43.984 --> 00:24:47.744
They're so ritualistic in everything.

00:24:47.744 --> 00:24:55.844
So one should understand a difference between
a protocol and ritualism.

00:24:55.844 --> 00:24:59.375
An innocent child knows the protocol.

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:08.104
I remember there was a child who came to see
Me in Austria and I said, "Let's go upstairs."

00:25:08.104 --> 00:25:13.464
So it was a small, little staircase of wood.

00:25:13.464 --> 00:25:14.484
He said, "What?

00:25:14.484 --> 00:25:18.814
Is She going to go up without a red carpet?"

00:25:18.814 --> 00:25:23.785
This came into his head, you see.

00:25:23.785 --> 00:25:31.005
So for children, you see, innocent children,
the worship, everything is not ritualistic.

00:25:31.005 --> 00:25:32.084
It is heartfelt.

00:25:32.084 --> 00:25:44.964
You feel it from the heart: how to do the
worship, how to show your love.

00:25:44.964 --> 00:25:58.824
Is very sweet way an innocent person does
it; while a person who is very ritualistic,

00:25:58.824 --> 00:26:04.684
he may even beat another person because, "Why
did you do this?

00:26:04.684 --> 00:26:06.885
You should not have put camphor in it?

00:26:06.885 --> 00:26:08.604
Why did you put the camphor so?

00:26:08.604 --> 00:26:10.604
It's very wrong."

00:26:10.604 --> 00:26:12.614
There's nothing wrong.

00:26:12.614 --> 00:26:23.045
If you do it with your heart, with your open
heart, innocently, anything is all right.

00:26:23.045 --> 00:26:30.964
It is the open heart which is necessary, not
the closed heart - "Why did you do it?

00:26:30.964 --> 00:26:33.574
Why didn't you do it?

00:26:33.574 --> 00:26:35.035
Where did you sit?

00:26:35.035 --> 00:26:36.035
What happened?"

00:26:36.035 --> 00:26:37.035
Nothing.

00:26:37.035 --> 00:26:43.515
Now you are in the Kingdom of God and here
there are no such rules and regulations that

00:26:43.515 --> 00:26:46.775
you should be ritualistic.

00:26:46.775 --> 00:26:51.104
But everything has a double, has a double
style.

00:26:51.104 --> 00:26:56.974
Now I say you need not be ritualistic.

00:26:56.974 --> 00:26:58.255
Once I went into an ashram.

00:26:58.255 --> 00:27:01.535
I found everything was just like a pigsty.

00:27:01.535 --> 00:27:04.185
I said, "What's this?

00:27:04.185 --> 00:27:07.344
Is this an ashram or what is it?"

00:27:07.344 --> 00:27:15.645
So they said, "Mother, You told us that, "You
have to be innocent and you don't have to

00:27:15.645 --> 00:27:18.294
be ritualistic."

00:27:18.294 --> 00:27:21.755
So we thought, "Throw all the things wherever
you feel like.

00:27:21.755 --> 00:27:25.055
What is there to be ritualistic?"

00:27:25.055 --> 00:27:31.334
Is a very common thing with all the ashram
people, leaders tell Me that Sahaja Yogis

00:27:31.334 --> 00:27:36.964
have no sense at all of looking after the
cleanliness of the ashram.

00:27:36.964 --> 00:27:38.695
They're least bothered.

00:27:38.695 --> 00:27:44.885
If it is their house, they look after; but
if it is an ashram they do not.

00:27:44.885 --> 00:27:52.185
It's very surprising and I have seen, or I
have heard, that ashrams all of bhootish and

00:27:52.185 --> 00:27:57.785
false gurus are absolutely spick and span.

00:27:57.785 --> 00:28:00.595
Really.

00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:09.584
Is very surprising and, even here in Cabella,
people were telling Me that they're living

00:28:09.584 --> 00:28:11.554
like animals.

00:28:11.554 --> 00:28:18.454
I said, "Animals are innocent, you know."

00:28:18.454 --> 00:28:23.924
You go into a jungle, now - I don't know,
we are going to take you this time into a

00:28:23.924 --> 00:28:30.405
jungle - you'll have no smell, no horrid things
to see, nothing.

00:28:30.405 --> 00:28:34.395
It's very clean, spick and span, all the time.

00:28:34.395 --> 00:28:40.854
But you put one human being, you will immediately
know that there has been a human being.

00:28:40.854 --> 00:28:44.494
They have their own systems of keeping things
clean.

00:28:44.494 --> 00:28:51.944
Even the tiger, who is an innocent thing - up
to animal stage you are innocent - he has

00:28:51.944 --> 00:28:55.454
his own styles.

00:28:55.454 --> 00:29:00.604
I don't know if you know about a tiger or
not, but a tiger will kill an animal because

00:29:00.604 --> 00:29:02.954
he has to eat, after all.

00:29:02.954 --> 00:29:04.114
He suppose to only eat animals.

00:29:04.114 --> 00:29:05.114
He doesn't eat grass.

00:29:05.114 --> 00:29:06.114
What to do?

00:29:06.114 --> 00:29:08.015
He's not a vegetarian.

00:29:08.015 --> 00:29:10.525
God has made him like that.

00:29:10.525 --> 00:29:13.255
So he accepts.

00:29:13.255 --> 00:29:17.694
Now he goes and kills the cow or anything.

00:29:17.694 --> 00:29:23.424
Then he leaves his kill there for the blood
to ooze out.

00:29:23.424 --> 00:29:32.694
Nobody will touch that, nobody, because he's
really the king, not out of fear, but of protocol.

00:29:32.694 --> 00:29:34.375
Then next day he goes.

00:29:34.375 --> 00:29:37.425
He eats, then his family eats and all that.

00:29:37.425 --> 00:29:39.684
Then finished for the whole month.

00:29:39.684 --> 00:29:41.914
They come out.

00:29:41.914 --> 00:29:46.914
Then the lower animals start going there.

00:29:46.914 --> 00:29:58.054
Like you have - don't know what you call them
... I miss in English.

00:29:58.054 --> 00:30:01.215
I don't know if they have - leopards, leopards.

00:30:01.215 --> 00:30:07.324
Leopards and all these animals come out and
they start eating.

00:30:07.324 --> 00:30:09.375
And then even lower and lower till the birds.

00:30:09.375 --> 00:30:13.544
Still the crow, they stay back.

00:30:13.544 --> 00:30:16.424
Last are crows.

00:30:16.424 --> 00:30:19.294
Can you imagine?

00:30:19.294 --> 00:30:24.094
Such a system, they have.

00:30:24.094 --> 00:30:34.214
They go all the way from Siberia to Australia.

00:30:34.214 --> 00:30:35.554
How do they manage?

00:30:35.554 --> 00:30:37.354
Think of it.

00:30:37.354 --> 00:30:41.255
What gives them direction is innocence.

00:30:41.255 --> 00:30:46.844
And the innocence is magnet.

00:30:46.844 --> 00:30:47.844
It's a magnet.

00:30:47.844 --> 00:30:49.794
It's actually, it's a magnet.

00:30:49.794 --> 00:30:55.375
In a human being you do not find a magnet
because it has now evolved so much, but it

00:30:55.375 --> 00:30:59.125
starts just like a magnet.

00:30:59.125 --> 00:31:02.945
So they know which is north, which is south,
east and west.

00:31:02.945 --> 00:31:08.104
Even a little bee, you find and put a mark
on it.

00:31:08.104 --> 00:31:14.135
It goes to the place from where it has come.

00:31:14.135 --> 00:31:19.155
How does it find its own way?

00:31:19.155 --> 00:31:26.165
Is the innocence, is like a magnet, acts like
a magnet.

00:31:26.165 --> 00:31:28.304
Even in the fishes.

00:31:28.304 --> 00:31:30.835
Just imagine how fishes have direction.

00:31:30.835 --> 00:31:36.474
We don't have - I mean, human beings can be
lost, I mean many a times I am lost with so

00:31:36.474 --> 00:31:43.684
many drivers I've had.

00:31:43.684 --> 00:31:55.844
So many times I've been lost, but animals
never.

00:31:55.844 --> 00:32:05.204
You know, if you take a dog and you don't
want the dog, you leave him about, say, fifty

00:32:05.204 --> 00:32:09.054
miles away, he'll come back.

00:32:09.054 --> 00:32:13.494
How does he find the way?

00:32:13.494 --> 00:32:24.164
So their qualities which are built-in within
them, through their innocence, are actually

00:32:24.164 --> 00:32:33.084
the qualities of electromagnetic force and
also pranava; that is when electromagnetic

00:32:33.084 --> 00:32:42.164
force is charged with Ganesha's Principle.

00:32:42.164 --> 00:32:44.045
That's why they're so systematic.

00:32:44.045 --> 00:32:45.804
They are so clean.

00:32:45.804 --> 00:32:55.145
They are so sensible, but they're not ritualistic.

00:32:55.145 --> 00:32:59.544
They're not ritualistic.

00:32:59.544 --> 00:33:03.515
Whatever God has given them, they have accepted.

00:33:03.515 --> 00:33:05.994
They're bound by that.

00:33:05.994 --> 00:33:11.685
They're bound and they live with that boundary.

00:33:11.685 --> 00:33:18.734
Even if you go up to the stage of animals
which live with human beings, they, too, are

00:33:18.734 --> 00:33:20.555
very affectionate.

00:33:20.555 --> 00:33:22.904
They just want love.

00:33:22.904 --> 00:33:24.145
Nothing else.

00:33:24.145 --> 00:33:31.114
See, one day if you do not care for your dog,
he'll just not eat his food, not eat his food.

00:33:31.114 --> 00:33:34.925
He wouldn't care for the food.

00:33:34.925 --> 00:33:44.714
It is so remarkable, even I have seen among
children how they just want love.

00:33:44.714 --> 00:33:49.515
They don't accept anything else but love;
but as soon as they start growing up, you

00:33:49.515 --> 00:33:56.905
see, specially in a materialistic world, then
the whole materialism comes in.

00:33:56.905 --> 00:34:06.294
So the second way we kill our children's innocence
is putting materialistic ideas into their

00:34:06.294 --> 00:34:07.294
heads.

00:34:07.294 --> 00:34:13.675
Of course, the media is there which is selling
now-a-days a teddy bear which has a birthday.

00:34:13.675 --> 00:34:16.215
Teddy bear has a birthday.

00:34:16.215 --> 00:34:18.364
Can you imagine?

00:34:18.364 --> 00:34:21.895
So everybody's buying teddy bear with a birthday.

00:34:21.895 --> 00:34:27.955
Because the parents don't want to be in the
company of children, so they get some sort

00:34:27.955 --> 00:34:32.805
of a toys - this, that, one or two is all
right - and put them with the toys, with the

00:34:32.805 --> 00:34:33.805
television on.

00:34:33.805 --> 00:34:37.885
"Now, sit down."

00:34:37.885 --> 00:34:41.875
Children start becoming naturally materialistic.

00:34:41.875 --> 00:34:55.865
They start asking for things, and for
demands of such kind that sometimes one is

00:34:55.865 --> 00:34:57.514
surprised.

00:34:57.514 --> 00:35:03.774
You take a western child to the market and
you've had it.

00:35:03.774 --> 00:35:07.794
But you take Indian children, they'll never
take anything.

00:35:07.794 --> 00:35:09.774
Really, it's so difficult to make them.

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:12.915
At least, I have seen My own grandchildren
and other.

00:35:12.915 --> 00:35:17.224
You take them, it's a headache to buy even
another pair of shoes for them.

00:35:17.224 --> 00:35:18.514
"No, but we have one.

00:35:18.514 --> 00:35:20.984
Why do you want to buy another?"

00:35:20.984 --> 00:35:22.554
"...That will give way."

00:35:22.554 --> 00:35:23.974
"No, we can come here."

00:35:23.974 --> 00:35:24.974
"How."

00:35:24.974 --> 00:35:27.215
"We can come in the car or else we can walk."

00:35:27.215 --> 00:35:28.835
"But you'll have no shoes.

00:35:28.835 --> 00:35:29.835
Nothing."

00:35:29.835 --> 00:35:30.835
"One is all right.

00:35:30.835 --> 00:35:32.245
Why to have two?"

00:35:32.245 --> 00:35:39.105
You give them money, they'll buy one small
little thing and come.

00:35:39.105 --> 00:35:50.534
You see, it is the whole tradition of materialism
which has brought this innocence to a stop.

00:35:50.534 --> 00:35:55.105
Then a child starts growing in the same materialistic
way.

00:35:55.105 --> 00:36:02.774
He starts judging people like, "How many cars
you have?"

00:36:02.774 --> 00:36:10.066
You see, they're so stupidly materialistic
that I went to Boston and the television people

00:36:10.066 --> 00:36:12.565
asked Me, "How many Rolls Royces You have?"

00:36:12.565 --> 00:36:14.534
I said, "I don't have any."

00:36:14.534 --> 00:36:15.935
They said, "We are not interested.

00:36:15.935 --> 00:36:19.855
You are not in the business."

00:36:19.855 --> 00:36:27.725
This is what is now the mind of people in
the West who have grown up.

00:36:27.725 --> 00:36:32.234
But even the children, today they want this,
tomorrow they want that.

00:36:32.234 --> 00:36:44.035
All the time there's a competition for materialistic
things, asking for this, asking for that.

00:36:44.035 --> 00:36:54.294
Just imagine what a race will be there after
some years when there'll be just people who'll

00:36:54.294 --> 00:36:57.845
be only worried about collecting things and
buying things.

00:36:57.845 --> 00:37:03.145
I mean, buyers and sellers, nothing else.

00:37:03.145 --> 00:37:12.865
So you have to be very careful with your children
that you do not pamper them, do not get too

00:37:12.865 --> 00:37:17.865
much worried about them, do not keep them
on materialistic level.

00:37:17.865 --> 00:37:18.865
Find out.

00:37:18.865 --> 00:37:23.034
If they are going on a materialistic level,
bring them down.

00:37:23.034 --> 00:37:31.724
It's very simple to do that and one has to
work it out because we have to save our children

00:37:31.724 --> 00:37:33.195
and their innocence.

00:37:33.195 --> 00:37:44.365
Now for the other Sahaja Yogis who are grown
up and who are very mature, they are very

00:37:44.365 --> 00:37:45.645
innocent, I must say.

00:37:45.645 --> 00:37:46.734
I must admit that.

00:37:46.734 --> 00:37:50.765
They're very innocent compared to the society
that is around.

00:37:50.765 --> 00:37:52.005
No doubt.

00:37:52.005 --> 00:37:59.645
One has to really admire the way they have
become so innocent, the way they're understanding

00:37:59.645 --> 00:38:03.005
this divine music and all.

00:38:03.005 --> 00:38:06.365
That's really creditable.

00:38:06.365 --> 00:38:15.994
But still, this innocence, if it is not spread,
if this innocence doesn't work out, then it

00:38:15.994 --> 00:38:19.754
will rust, will not grow.

00:38:19.754 --> 00:38:23.635
Your I.Q. will be less than the others, I
can tell you this much.

00:38:23.635 --> 00:38:27.735
They are growing in materialism all right.

00:38:27.735 --> 00:38:35.244
Their I.Q. is growing in materialisms, but
your I.Q. will not grow unless and until you

00:38:35.244 --> 00:38:38.635
spread this innocence around.

00:38:38.635 --> 00:38:43.204
Now you know how to do it.

00:38:43.204 --> 00:38:48.234
It is the power of Kundalini with the help
of Shri Ganesh.

00:38:48.234 --> 00:38:49.875
He helps you at every chakra.

00:38:49.875 --> 00:38:56.415
I have written that He's the Vice Chancellor
of every university, where He has to stamp.

00:38:56.415 --> 00:39:05.294
He's at every point, but you have to understand
that this has to spread.

00:39:05.294 --> 00:39:06.705
It has to become collective.

00:39:06.705 --> 00:39:11.845
It has to flow.

00:39:11.845 --> 00:39:20.294
So to become that, what should we do ourselves?

00:39:20.294 --> 00:39:27.805
That we should try to organize programs.

00:39:27.805 --> 00:39:33.545
While people will be enamored by your innocence,
no doubt.

00:39:33.545 --> 00:39:36.975
They'll be surprised how are you so innocent.

00:39:36.975 --> 00:39:40.915
How can you be so nice in these modern times?

00:39:40.915 --> 00:39:43.215
No doubt about it.

00:39:43.215 --> 00:39:49.985
But, in that doing, that so, try to be innocent
yourself.

00:39:49.985 --> 00:39:50.985
Should not be cunning.

00:39:50.985 --> 00:39:52.615
You should not be smart.

00:39:52.615 --> 00:39:59.274
You should not try to show that you are very
brilliant or anything; because the ego might,

00:39:59.274 --> 00:40:04.105
in between, come and try to put ideas into
your head.

00:40:04.105 --> 00:40:11.284
It's better to show that you're innocent and
to be innocent inside.

00:40:11.284 --> 00:40:21.175
The whole inner being can be really charged
with the energy of Shri Ganesh, no doubt,

00:40:21.175 --> 00:40:24.385
and the outer life becomes innocent.

00:40:24.385 --> 00:40:26.804
Becomes innocent.

00:40:26.804 --> 00:40:30.665
I mean, I don't know banking.

00:40:30.665 --> 00:40:31.665
I don't know money.

00:40:31.665 --> 00:40:39.534
I am quite bad at everything - all right,
at worldly things, but I'm not cunning.

00:40:39.534 --> 00:40:49.385
I'm not, sort of, smart, as you can see; but
still things are working out because of the

00:40:49.385 --> 00:40:53.125
inner power that one has.

00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:58.985
So depend on your inner power and manifest
it outside.

00:40:58.985 --> 00:41:06.445
Inner being, which is Ganesha, is the same
in all of us.

00:41:06.445 --> 00:41:10.034
The whole system is the same in all of us.

00:41:10.034 --> 00:41:12.515
Chakras are the same in all of us.

00:41:12.515 --> 00:41:24.715
Only thing, we have to keep our innocence
absolutely free of all this worldly nonsense

00:41:24.715 --> 00:41:28.554
like a fashion, this, that.

00:41:28.554 --> 00:41:35.155
Immediately, you'll find that your being will
manifest.

00:41:35.155 --> 00:41:37.475
Being will manifest.

00:41:37.475 --> 00:41:40.655
Now just think of simple thing like that.

00:41:40.655 --> 00:41:49.704
I am an Indian, I mean, and nobody knows Me;
but whenever I have My lecture, I have at

00:41:49.704 --> 00:41:51.524
least five to six thousand people.

00:41:51.524 --> 00:41:52.524
How?

00:41:52.524 --> 00:41:56.665
How do they come to My lecture like that?

00:41:56.665 --> 00:41:58.885
Anywhere in the whole world.

00:41:58.885 --> 00:41:59.885
Minimum.

00:41:59.885 --> 00:42:02.454
Sometimes you're much more.

00:42:02.454 --> 00:42:07.575
What's so special?

00:42:07.575 --> 00:42:14.964
So when handling the people, we are Sahaja
Yogis, we are saints, we have to talk to them

00:42:14.964 --> 00:42:16.454
like saints.

00:42:16.454 --> 00:42:28.115
We have to behave like saints, and they should
in no way feel that we are cunning or we are

00:42:28.115 --> 00:42:31.764
interested in something else.

00:42:31.764 --> 00:42:41.274
So, once you start doing that, flowing your
innocence, you know, all the Gods and Goddesses

00:42:41.274 --> 00:42:42.675
will help.

00:42:42.675 --> 00:42:53.734
Your creativity will be thousand times more
than normal.

00:42:53.734 --> 00:42:56.325
Everybody has to think how we are going to
spread it.

00:42:56.325 --> 00:43:00.815
Like I was happy to know that in America,
of all the places, they have got hold of these

00:43:00.815 --> 00:43:04.304
senators - very good idea.

00:43:04.304 --> 00:43:08.595
Let us see if it works out.

00:43:08.595 --> 00:43:19.645
So we have to find out all the ways and methods
and all the styles which will behoove a saint,

00:43:19.645 --> 00:43:26.065
not a politician or - these days, of course,
all the sports people are heroes.

00:43:26.065 --> 00:43:31.414
I mean, if you want to become a hero, you
become a sportsman.

00:43:31.414 --> 00:43:39.474
Not like that, but like a saint; and saintliness
is respected, whatever may be the situation,

00:43:39.474 --> 00:43:45.475
whatever may be the situation, whosoever may
be facing you.

00:43:45.475 --> 00:43:52.145
Recently when I was in Kiev, the leaders wife
told Me that, "Mother, we had that old car

00:43:52.145 --> 00:43:57.514
of Yours, which we sold and we got so much
money that we could buy a new car.

00:43:57.514 --> 00:44:02.425
Then we went to the factory to buy the new
car."

00:44:02.425 --> 00:44:04.425
And they bought it.

00:44:04.425 --> 00:44:06.895
So outside the factory there's a mafia.

00:44:06.895 --> 00:44:12.514
Nowadays I think the Sicilians have reached
there.

00:44:12.514 --> 00:44:19.745
So the mafia was standing outside and they
said, "You have to pay so much money to us."

00:44:19.745 --> 00:44:20.905
In thousands.

00:44:20.905 --> 00:44:23.035
So they said, "We have no money."

00:44:23.035 --> 00:44:24.165
"Why?

00:44:24.165 --> 00:44:26.025
What do you do?"

00:44:26.025 --> 00:44:27.095
This was his wife.

00:44:27.095 --> 00:44:29.825
She said, "We meditate."

00:44:29.825 --> 00:44:30.825
"Really.

00:44:30.825 --> 00:44:31.825
So you have no money."

00:44:31.825 --> 00:44:32.825
"No."

00:44:32.825 --> 00:44:33.825
"What about those children?"

00:44:33.825 --> 00:44:34.825
"They also meditate."

00:44:34.825 --> 00:44:36.994
She's so innocently she was talking to them.

00:44:36.994 --> 00:44:40.675
They said that, "We saw their faces melting
down."

00:44:40.675 --> 00:44:43.885
They said, "All right.

00:44:43.885 --> 00:44:44.885
Go."

00:44:44.885 --> 00:44:49.675
They forgot that they were suppose to get
money out of them.

00:44:49.675 --> 00:44:54.215
Or they take the car, they confiscate the
car or take the money.

00:44:54.215 --> 00:44:55.415
They said, "All right.

00:44:55.415 --> 00:44:56.415
Go."

00:44:56.415 --> 00:44:57.415
They told Me this story.

00:44:57.415 --> 00:45:00.454
So your simplicity always helps.

00:45:00.454 --> 00:45:07.974
Your innocence always helps you, and it has
such an impact, such an impact.

00:45:07.974 --> 00:45:17.925
I tell you that a personality, what we call
in Sanskrit is a "vigraha."

00:45:17.925 --> 00:45:22.835
Vigraha means a personality which has a coefficience.

00:45:22.835 --> 00:45:34.744
The person who is innocent has such a great
coefficience that he can charm anybody.

00:45:34.744 --> 00:45:43.195
But, first and foremost thing that we have
to be innocent, not to so much worry about

00:45:43.195 --> 00:45:57.435
money, not to count everything, not to worry
about food; but this is not to be done with

00:45:57.435 --> 00:45:58.945
deliberations, but innocence.

00:45:58.945 --> 00:46:03.755
Where you sleep, what you do is not important
to a saint.

00:46:03.755 --> 00:46:14.735
It lives the way one has to live because his
nourishing point is innocence, and he doesn't

00:46:14.735 --> 00:46:16.095
get angry.

00:46:16.095 --> 00:46:18.365
He doesn't shout at people.

00:46:18.365 --> 00:46:19.365
Nothing.

00:46:19.365 --> 00:46:24.043
Of course, at bhoots it may be that he has
to shout like Christ did; 

00:46:24.243 --> 00:46:31.986
but otherwise, he is a very peaceful, joyous, happy, humorous person.

00:46:32.186 --> 00:46:36.886
so today, at this puja, I would bless you with all

00:46:36.986 --> 00:46:41.386
the qualities of Shri Ganesha, except for His anger.

00:46:41.586 --> 00:46:43.757
May God bless you
