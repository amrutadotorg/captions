Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Public Program, Cincinnati, USA

01:03.690 --> 01:20.690
June 14th, 1989

01:20.690 --> 01:31.460
At the very outset we have to understand that
truth is what it is.

01:31.460 --> 01:39.740
We cannot organize it, we cannot order it,
nor can we conceptualize it.

01:39.740 --> 01:50.430
It has to be felt on your central nervous
system and this is what it is called, what

01:50.430 --> 02:01.880
we call as Self Realization, or we can say
the second birth as told by Christ.

02:01.880 --> 02:09.090
It’s not an artificial way of accepting
any baptism.

02:09.090 --> 02:15.340
That we say that we are baptized but whether
you are baptized or not baptized, you are

02:15.340 --> 02:16.370
just the same.

02:16.370 --> 02:22.670
There’s nothing special has happened to
you, nothing has happened to your awareness,

02:22.670 --> 02:25.760
nothing has happened to your personality.

02:25.760 --> 02:37.390
So when we say that we have to have our Self
Realization means, whatever is our human awareness,

02:37.390 --> 02:43.319
has to achieve a new break-through.

02:43.319 --> 02:49.280
In the process of our evolutionary process
– which is, as you know, is a living process

02:49.280 --> 02:56.969
– we have achieved a state, what we call
as human beings.

02:56.969 --> 03:07.890
And human beings have freedom to choose whatever
they like - till they realize with their own

03:07.890 --> 03:11.569
trial-and-error-methods that this is wrong,
this is wrong.

03:11.569 --> 03:18.859
It takes too much time for them really to
reach a point to understand what is really

03:18.859 --> 03:25.279
good and what is bad for their society, for
their country and also for themselves.

03:25.279 --> 03:36.529
Today when we are standing on the brink of
a delusion and a shock we don’t know what’s

03:36.529 --> 03:41.849
going to happen to us in future.

03:41.849 --> 03:46.900
One has to realize the One who has created
this beautiful universe is not going to allow

03:46.900 --> 03:52.660
this work of His to be destroyed.

03:52.660 --> 04:02.310
Only thing He has given you chance - full
chance to realize your freedom, to develop

04:02.310 --> 04:16.639
your wisdom and to see how far you really
understand what is right and what is wrong.

04:16.639 --> 04:26.030
In the human awareness whatever we know about
is in a relative terminology.

04:26.030 --> 04:33.720
We are not absolutely sure, there’s no absolute
knowledge with us – because we are not in

04:33.720 --> 04:36.060
the state of absoluteness.

04:36.060 --> 04:47.020
Also the development - the material, the physical,
the scientific, all development that has taken

04:47.020 --> 04:55.940
place has evolved us outside, just like a
tree has grown.

04:55.940 --> 05:03.740
But we have lost our roots and whatever just
now you have heard about is the knowledge

05:03.740 --> 05:05.110
of our roots.

05:05.110 --> 05:13.490
And if we do not know our roots we are waiting
really for a complete destructive shock.

05:13.490 --> 05:21.139
It’s an evolutionary process which has come
to this point and the break-through is a very

05:21.139 --> 05:28.970
small journey, say at the most of three to
four feet that you have to allow your Kundalini

05:28.970 --> 05:35.889
to rise and break through.

05:35.889 --> 05:40.629
About which thousands of years back people
have talked.

05:40.629 --> 05:50.930
In every country there has been lots of prophecies
that such a time will come when men of God

05:50.930 --> 05:53.289
will know the truth.

05:53.289 --> 05:54.990
And this is what it is.

05:54.990 --> 06:01.800
Today we have so many seekers, so many seekers
of truth who are genuine, honest, trying to

06:01.800 --> 06:04.919
find out what is the truth of life.

06:04.919 --> 06:06.520
Why are we here?

06:06.520 --> 06:07.530
What are we to do?

06:07.530 --> 06:16.930
You are here to enter into the kingdom of
God, to enjoy the blessings of God – not

06:16.930 --> 06:26.470
to torture yourself, not to trouble yourself,
but to abide in that beautiful land of God’s

06:26.470 --> 06:30.189
joyous, blissful state.

06:30.189 --> 06:35.550
For that you cannot pay.

06:35.550 --> 06:41.699
Please remember that God doesn’t understand
money – and you can’t pay for it.

06:41.699 --> 06:48.930
Anybody who takes money in the name of God
is a false personality, he’s a false person

06:48.930 --> 06:51.280
because you cannot pay for it.

06:51.280 --> 06:57.830
But when this happening takes place, when
your Kundalini, which is the pure desire within

06:57.830 --> 07:08.280
you - the pure desire - because all other
desires, as described in the economics, that

07:08.280 --> 07:11.030
they are not satiable in general.

07:11.030 --> 07:20.080
This desire is the one - this energy when
it rises then you become the giver of desires,

07:20.080 --> 07:28.620
all desires subside and just you enjoy each
and everything of this creation.

07:28.620 --> 07:36.409
This is all within us, is all your own.

07:36.409 --> 07:40.240
Just like one candle can enlighten another
candle - it works.

07:40.240 --> 07:46.419
It’s very spontaneous because it’s a living
process – as you can understand one seed

07:46.419 --> 07:52.069
if it has to sprout you have to just put it
in the Mother Earth, and the Mother Earth

07:52.069 --> 07:54.690
has got the power to sprout it.

07:54.690 --> 08:00.990
And when it sprouts it comes up by itself
– in the same way this Kundalini comes up

08:00.990 --> 08:07.090
by itself and you can feel the Cool Breeze
of the Holy Ghost around you.

08:07.090 --> 08:14.139
Now this Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost has
been described in the Bible, has been described

08:14.139 --> 08:20.020
in all Indian Scriptures as the all-pervading
Power of God’s Love.

08:20.020 --> 08:31.909
It’s described in all the western and eastern,
northern and southern scriptures, all the

08:31.909 --> 08:34.760
treaties of all the saints.

08:34.760 --> 08:42.060
So actually what happens to you that you become
a saint – but you don’t give up anything.

08:42.060 --> 08:46.589
You exist wherever you belong.

08:46.589 --> 08:51.190
You don’t give up anything – what is there
to be given up?

08:51.190 --> 08:57.940
Only thing you become a witness of the whole
play and you enjoy all that is created.

08:57.940 --> 09:07.100
All that you see – it seems to be a very
dangerous thing sometimes and sometimes very

09:07.100 --> 09:14.190
frustrating and sometimes very depressing,
everything becomes like a play.

09:14.190 --> 09:20.930
Like a thought that rises and falls off, another
thought rises and falls off and we are jumping

09:20.930 --> 09:22.279
on the cusp of the thought.

09:22.279 --> 09:28.260
You are thinking about the future and the
past, but we have to be in the present.

09:28.260 --> 09:34.930
When the Kundalini rises than you stand in
the present and you see the past and the future.

09:34.930 --> 09:39.779
And when you see the past and the future you
are surprised that you are silent.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.810
There is no thought.

09:41.810 --> 09:46.230
Now when you are out of the water it’s much
easy to solve the problem.

09:46.230 --> 09:51.790
You can see the water and you are not afraid
of it – you are in the boat, you can enjoy

09:51.790 --> 09:52.790
the ride.

09:52.790 --> 10:00.540
But supposing you become a master who can
swim then you can save others also.

10:00.540 --> 10:07.220
The time has come for humanity, for all of
us to get this blessing.

10:07.220 --> 10:10.990
This is all built-in within you, I don’t
have to do anything.

10:10.990 --> 10:15.839
It’s like one candle which is enlightened
can enlighten another candle.

10:15.839 --> 10:21.230
It’s enlightenment which is just spontaneous,
happens spontaneously.

10:21.230 --> 10:27.940
So I do not deserve any credit for you and
you don’t have to be obliged about it.

10:27.940 --> 10:33.399
It’s just your own, it’s your own property
by which you achieve.

10:33.399 --> 10:37.620
Now the knowledge about the Kundalini, all
the knowledge about all these things are to

10:37.620 --> 10:44.810
be taken in a very open-minded way like a
scientific attitude.

10:44.810 --> 10:50.500
Now I put before you, or he has put before
you this hypothesis and you should see for

10:50.500 --> 10:52.600
yourself - it works or not.

10:52.600 --> 10:57.800
If it does not work, all right – we should
work harder to see that it works out.

10:57.800 --> 11:08.649
But when it works, honestly you must believe
in it and you must go with it, and you must

11:08.649 --> 11:13.380
take upon yourself that now you are a light
and you have to give light to others.

11:13.380 --> 11:16.450
This is a very, very important thing.

11:16.450 --> 11:22.690
As a result of this happening, of course,
diseases get cured, many incurable diseases

11:22.690 --> 11:25.709
have been cured by Sahaja Yoga.

11:25.709 --> 11:32.670
There are mental cases which are being cured,
people feel absolutely peaceful, the so-called

11:32.670 --> 11:34.790
tension-business disappears.

11:34.790 --> 11:40.570
Because I think a little hole is created and
the whole heat comes out of your heads as

11:40.570 --> 11:45.710
the tension passes out and you feel absolutely
relaxed.

11:45.710 --> 11:56.620
You look very young, you feel very young and
the whole attitude of life changes as if you

11:56.620 --> 12:01.660
are asking for something always, now you are
standing here to give something.

12:01.660 --> 12:11.810
All these things are at hand, you don’t
have to do anything difficult.

12:11.810 --> 12:15.139
And why not, why not we all get our Realization?

12:15.139 --> 12:19.259
I am sorry to say that I am here only for
tonight.

12:19.259 --> 12:25.670
On My way I - just as if I have stopped here,
I wish I was here for a longer period to be

12:25.670 --> 12:26.670
with you all.

12:26.670 --> 12:32.009
But we have here some very good Sahaja Yogis
who are very senior people, who have mastered

12:32.009 --> 12:35.780
this and they’ll be very good to you.

12:35.780 --> 12:41.029
And they are very compassionate, they are
very righteous people and they lead a very

12:41.029 --> 12:42.730
beautiful life.

12:42.730 --> 12:48.280
So you’ll be happy to meet them and they
will help you and then, as one light enlightens

12:48.280 --> 12:51.699
another, you can go on enlightening another
people.

12:51.699 --> 12:57.649
It’s a very simple method, there’s nothing
much is to be done and children are the best

12:57.649 --> 13:01.010
for it.

13:01.010 --> 13:07.440
Now I have to just say that supposing in this
place if I have to come and put on the light

13:07.440 --> 13:09.779
we just have to switch on.

13:09.779 --> 13:11.040
That’s all.

13:11.040 --> 13:16.459
I need not tell you about the whole electricity,
about the history of electricity, how it was

13:16.459 --> 13:20.089
brought and the source of electricity.

13:20.089 --> 13:23.400
In the same way you are built-in, it’s within
you.

13:23.400 --> 13:29.080
Through your different stages of evolution
everything is built-in within you.

13:29.080 --> 13:36.199
So you don’t have to do much about it, but
once you get the light then it’s better

13:36.199 --> 13:37.910
to know more about it.

13:37.910 --> 13:43.769
For example if somebody is holding a snake
in the hand, he is in the darkness, he can’t

13:43.769 --> 13:47.290
see anything, and if you tell him, “You
know it’s a snake”, he’ll say, “No,

13:47.290 --> 13:48.290
it’s a rope.”

13:48.290 --> 13:50.560
He’ll argue with you.

13:50.560 --> 13:55.650
It’s better is to put on the light and let
him see for himself so he drops it.

13:55.650 --> 14:01.220
In the same way as he has told you all your
conditionings and habits drop out, because

14:01.220 --> 14:02.220
there is light.

14:02.220 --> 14:08.569
But it’s not mental, it’s just a happening,
the center which is here as Agnya chakra is

14:08.569 --> 14:14.190
shown there which crosses, this center when
awakened, this is the center of Christ.

14:14.190 --> 14:20.670
When this center is awakened it sucks in all
our conditioning and our ego, that’s why

14:20.670 --> 14:24.740
we say that He died for our sins.

14:24.740 --> 14:31.310
But He is to be awakened, if He is awakened
then He sucks in and then you get your Realization.

14:31.310 --> 14:40.000
This is a very simple method built within
us for our second birth which is a reality,

14:40.000 --> 14:44.009
which is not something just talking or words.

14:44.009 --> 14:48.779
I hope most of you get your Realization in
this beautiful atmosphere.

14:48.779 --> 14:51.110
May God bless you all!

14:51.110 --> 14:56.980
Now, I would like to have some questions from
you, but it’s so far away, you are so far

14:56.980 --> 15:02.300
away from Me, I don’t know how will I be
able to relate, but if you have some good

15:02.300 --> 15:11.600
questions – not to challenge or not to sort
of criticize, but ask questions which are

15:11.600 --> 15:14.180
related to the subject, which will help you.

15:14.180 --> 15:18.680
Because I am not here for seeking votes or
for any money or anything.

15:18.680 --> 15:22.730
You can’t give Me anything, it’s better
you take something from Me, will be a better

15:22.730 --> 15:23.730
idea.

15:23.730 --> 15:27.029
So if you want to ask some questions, please
ask.

15:27.029 --> 15:35.290
A lot can be said about Sahaja Yoga – I
must have given at least 4,000 lectures or

15:35.290 --> 15:37.870
5,000 lectures in English language.

15:37.870 --> 15:39.940
Aside: Yes, all right.

15:39.940 --> 15:44.850
But that’s different, I said first have
your enlightenment and then we can talk about

15:44.850 --> 15:47.589
it.

15:47.589 --> 15:53.069
Yes please.

15:53.069 --> 15:59.670
YOGI: Why this time in history can they have
a gift like this?

15:59.670 --> 16:03.310
SHRI MATAJI: It’s a blossomtime, Sir.

16:03.310 --> 16:13.720
(Shri Mataji laughing) You see, in the beginning
of the Tree of Life we had very few flowers,

16:13.720 --> 16:16.870
but now it’s a blossomtime.

16:16.870 --> 16:24.810
We have so many people who are seeking the
truth.

16:24.810 --> 16:32.110
It was all prophesized long time back, that
the modern times - as they call it, the Kali

16:32.110 --> 16:40.370
Yuga - you’ll find people who will be leading
a normal life, normal householders will be

16:40.370 --> 16:45.510
seeking the truth and they’ll find it.

16:45.510 --> 17:05.300
SEEKER: [ What will be the result of this
special time?

17:05.300 --> 17:06.300
INDIST…]

17:06.300 --> 17:09.140
YOGI: He wants to know, what will be the results
of this special time, this blossoms, what

17:09.140 --> 17:10.310
will it mean, what will it do in their lives?

17:10.310 --> 17:15.860
SHRI MATAJI: Now I would say, I mean so many
things it can do.

17:15.860 --> 17:24.760
But you see around, we have people who are
Christians, Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs – all

17:24.760 --> 17:27.539
kinds of people we have.

17:27.539 --> 17:35.090
We have Americans, Indians, all types - human
beings.

17:35.090 --> 17:41.140
And everybody is capable of committing any
horrible thing, any violent thing, any sinful

17:41.140 --> 17:42.140
thing.

17:42.140 --> 17:46.080
There is no binding force.

17:46.080 --> 17:53.270
So when we talk of peace they have no peace
within themselves.

17:53.270 --> 17:59.280
You just talk of peace, there are foundations
of peace and organizations of peace - at the

17:59.280 --> 18:04.700
slightest pretext you find they themselves
become violent.

18:04.700 --> 18:14.610
So what you need is the transformation of
a human being who expresses the Spirit.

18:14.610 --> 18:22.960
The Spirit which is knowledge, knowledge which
is not relative, which is not mental, but

18:22.960 --> 18:32.340
which is absolute, compassion and love that
expresses joy.

18:32.340 --> 18:40.600
And attention that can work out things.

18:40.600 --> 18:51.000
All this is within the reach of human beings
in these modern times, the blossomtime.

18:51.000 --> 18:53.060
We have to transform human beings.

18:53.060 --> 18:59.500
All the problems of this world are created
by human beings and not by God – so that

18:59.500 --> 19:04.960
transformation creates a beautiful race of
people who are collective.

19:04.960 --> 19:16.150
They act as collective beings because your
Spirit is the collective being within you.

19:16.150 --> 19:21.630
So it’s like you become part and parcel
of the whole.

19:21.630 --> 19:27.141
If this finger is suffering immediately My
another hand helps it.

19:27.141 --> 19:34.180
It doesn’t think I have to oblige or anything
because it’s a part and parcel of the whole.

19:34.180 --> 19:40.150
In the same way we become genuinely collective.

19:40.150 --> 19:51.520
As a result the complete emancipation of humanity
can be achieved.

19:51.520 --> 20:01.280
The best part of the whole thing is that today
it is acting en masse.

20:01.280 --> 20:14.299
The righteousness, the compassion, the love,
the wisdom of saints is now manifesting en

20:14.299 --> 20:16.809
masse.

20:16.809 --> 20:22.280
Other things happen also, I would say I have
known people who never knew what is art have

20:22.280 --> 20:32.560
become artists - artists who create things
which emit divine vibrations.

20:32.560 --> 20:41.660
Then there are people who never could sing
have started singing; those who could not

20:41.660 --> 20:52.940
do good in their work have become dynamic
– but despite all that they are compassionate

20:52.940 --> 20:55.770
and honest.

20:55.770 --> 21:03.370
I’m sorry this is the first time I’ve
come to Cincinnati, that’s why it sounds

21:03.370 --> 21:09.150
little fantastic – but we are fantastic,
we are fantastic.

21:09.150 --> 21:13.250
In a village of India, if supposing you take
a television and say that, “You can see

21:13.250 --> 21:16.820
all kinds of beautiful images”, nobody is
going to believe you.

21:16.820 --> 21:21.470
They’ll say, “Ah, he’s telling stories,
this is just a box of plastic.”

21:21.470 --> 21:26.580
But when you put to the mains it starts working.

21:26.580 --> 21:31.539
In the same way you start working like a computer.

21:31.539 --> 21:37.350
You are a divine computer – only thing you
have to be aware of it.

21:37.350 --> 21:40.950
And if it is going to be that way - why not?

21:40.950 --> 22:03.750
FEMALE SEEKER: Could you please elaborate
on how when the Kundalini is awakened, how

22:03.750 --> 22:07.190
that’ll erase the negative karma?

22:07.190 --> 22:08.190
SHRI MATAJI: What’s it?

22:08.190 --> 22:09.190
YOGI: She wants to know, she is asking You
to elaborate on how when the Kundalini is

22:09.190 --> 22:10.190
awakened it removes negative karma.

22:10.190 --> 22:14.710
SHRI MATAJI: It does.

22:14.710 --> 22:21.770
You see we judge ourselves in a very funny
way, all the time we are judging ourselves

22:21.770 --> 22:25.029
and feeling guilty and for small, small things
we think, “Oh!

22:25.029 --> 22:26.870
We should not have done this way.”

22:26.870 --> 22:35.100
Even if you spill a little coffee you think
you have done a disastrous thing.

22:35.100 --> 22:40.379
After all we are human beings – if you make
mistakes it’s all right.

22:40.379 --> 22:42.870
After all we are not God, are we?

22:42.870 --> 22:51.409
All the time we try condemning ourselves,
we done this bad, that one, we are negative.

22:51.409 --> 22:57.120
Also the suggestion comes from so many ways,
people say you are sinner, you have done this

22:57.120 --> 23:01.299
sin, that sin – just imagine.

23:01.299 --> 23:09.950
It’s not so, we are all human beings.

23:09.950 --> 23:17.289
So let your Kundalini which is your own individual
Mother decide what karmas you have done.

23:17.289 --> 23:20.659
And She’ll see to it that you get rid of
them.

23:20.659 --> 23:23.179
Don’t condemn yourself.

23:23.179 --> 23:25.700
Don’t feel guilty.

23:25.700 --> 23:36.760
That’s the first condition, if you feel
guilty I do not promise you Kundalini awakening,

23:36.760 --> 23:38.340
to begin with.

23:38.340 --> 23:42.190
Not to feel guilty at all.

23:42.190 --> 23:44.500
That’s first condition.

23:44.500 --> 23:49.890
Second is, we have to forgive everyone.

23:49.890 --> 23:53.630
After all, whether we forgive or if you don’t
forgive, we don’t do anything.

23:53.630 --> 23:57.730
I mean it’s a myth.

23:57.730 --> 24:02.630
We say it’s very difficult to forgive, but
what are you doing about it?

24:02.630 --> 24:06.690
Only thing, by not forgiving we are playing
into the wrong hands.

24:06.690 --> 24:12.799
So it’s a very great weapon we have got,
just you say, “I forgive everyone.”

24:12.799 --> 24:20.220
Don’t count how many you have to forgive,
don’t count their mistakes and your mistakes.

24:20.220 --> 24:26.730
In short - forget the past for the time being.

24:26.730 --> 24:30.760
And not to feel miserable about yourself.

24:30.760 --> 24:42.330
You have to be pleasantly placed - especially
towards yourself.

24:42.330 --> 24:50.200
If you are not pleasantly placed towards yourself,
you cannot be pleasantly placed towards anyone.

24:50.200 --> 24:57.169
All right?

24:57.169 --> 25:01.160
So should we have our Realization now?

25:01.160 --> 25:03.429
**** part 2 ****

25:03.429 --> 25:14.169
It’s they are too far away, if they can
come a little forward would be better.

25:14.169 --> 25:15.169
Yes, My child?

25:15.169 --> 25:16.169
FEMALE SEEKER: [INDIST.]

25:16.169 --> 25:17.169
SHRI MATAJI: I can’t hear.

25:17.169 --> 25:18.169
SEEKER: [INDIST.]

25:18.169 --> 25:19.169
SHRI MATAJI: What’s they say?

25:19.169 --> 25:22.491
YOGI: She’s saying that children are supposed
to be born in a more enlightened stage, and

25:22.491 --> 25:46.500
what can we do to help them maintain their
enlightening.

25:46.500 --> 25:54.899
SHRI MATAJI: Ahh, you should get your own…

25:54.899 --> 25:59.539
Oh Ma, they have all come here, look at that
– that’s Cincinnati really.

25:59.539 --> 26:01.690
May God bless you!

26:01.690 --> 26:03.149
Oh!

26:03.149 --> 26:07.549
Look at that!

26:07.549 --> 26:08.549
May God bless you all!

26:08.549 --> 26:15.679
Ah, but – yes, yes – by getting Realization
you’ll understand your children much better

26:15.679 --> 26:23.420
and you can do much better for them.

26:23.420 --> 26:39.310
Oh, it’s great, isn’t it?

26:39.310 --> 26:52.020
Please put Me forward.

26:52.020 --> 27:03.220
I have just to ask you to take out your shoes,
because shoes little bit tighten your feet.

27:03.220 --> 27:04.980
So just take out your shoes if possible.

27:04.980 --> 27:09.480
Aside: It’s all right, I have a shawl on
Me.

27:09.480 --> 27:20.080
With such earnestness, what beautiful people
you are - really so beautiful.

27:20.080 --> 27:25.940
So we are all going to enter into the kingdom
of God, and nobody has to feel guilty.

27:25.940 --> 27:35.380
When you are going on a big journey, so pleasant
at that we have to be very pleasant, we have

27:35.380 --> 27:39.809
to be very happy and enthusiastic.

27:39.809 --> 27:50.059
All right, it’s very, very simple – extremely
simple as I told you.

27:50.059 --> 27:57.970
They – as he has told that we have to little
bit help our centers.

27:57.970 --> 28:02.090
And on the left-hand side we’ll be helping
our centers.

28:02.090 --> 28:06.990
All those who are sitting up on the chair
should take out their shoes also, please – and

28:06.990 --> 28:12.000
put your feet on the Mother Earth because
this Mother Earth helps us a lot, She is a

28:12.000 --> 28:13.330
very helpful thing.

28:13.330 --> 28:15.809
And so, if you could take out your shoes I’ll
be thankful.

28:15.809 --> 28:18.830
For a little while, only ten minutes at the
most.

28:18.830 --> 28:21.620
(Shri Mataji laughing)

28:21.620 --> 28:26.010
Takes about ten minutes, not more than that
– and that much time we can always give

28:26.010 --> 28:32.570
to ourselves.

28:32.570 --> 28:38.770
And those who are sitting on a chair have
to put both the feet apart from each other.

28:38.770 --> 28:41.000
The best are those who are sitting on the
ground.

28:41.000 --> 28:42.620
All right.

28:42.620 --> 28:47.360
But in any case it will work, I am sure.

28:47.360 --> 28:54.450
Now what we have to do is to understand as
he has told you in a very short form, that

28:54.450 --> 29:01.700
the left side is the power of desire, so you
put the left hand towards Me, just like this,

29:01.700 --> 29:07.210
very comfortably, without troubling much,
just the left hand like that.

29:07.210 --> 29:09.720
Be comfortable.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.970
You can’t sit with the legs like that?

29:12.970 --> 29:17.470
Those who can’t sit like that, it will be
difficult, so at least have one foot up and

29:17.470 --> 29:22.590
another like that – so that you can put
the left hand towards Me.

29:22.590 --> 29:29.070
And the right hand on the Mother Earth – here
on the heart.

29:29.070 --> 29:32.720
On the heart.

29:32.720 --> 29:40.490
In the heart resides the Spirit – so first
we put our hand on the center where resides

29:40.490 --> 29:42.600
the Spirit.

29:42.600 --> 29:51.700
Then we take down our hand and put it on the
upper part of our abdomen on the left-hand

29:51.700 --> 29:52.740
side.

29:52.740 --> 30:02.169
Left hand all the time like this – desiring
to get your Realization.

30:02.169 --> 30:12.000
Then one has to understand that if you are
the Spirit you are also your master, you are

30:12.000 --> 30:15.450
also your guide – because there is light
and you know what is to be done, you don’t

30:15.450 --> 30:17.830
need any master, you don’t need any guru.

30:17.830 --> 30:21.659
You become your own guru.

30:21.659 --> 30:27.740
Then you take your right hand and put it in
the lower part of your abdomen, lower part

30:27.740 --> 30:32.130
on the left-hand side.

30:32.130 --> 30:40.299
The upper one was the center of your mastery,
the lower one is the center which gives you

30:40.299 --> 30:49.320
the manifestation of the Divine Power in your
central nervous system – means it’s the

30:49.320 --> 30:50.320
pure knowledge.

30:50.320 --> 30:56.779
It’s not the knowledge that you just know
through your mental activity, but is the pure

30:56.779 --> 30:57.779
knowledge.

30:57.779 --> 31:05.690
Like I can feel this is hot, or cold, this
is red, this is pink – in the same way.

31:05.690 --> 31:07.240
Absolutely.

31:07.240 --> 31:13.620
That’s the center for your pure knowledge.

31:13.620 --> 31:21.470
Then you take back your hand on the upper
part of your abdomen, again on the left-hand

31:21.470 --> 31:32.210
side, to raise the Kundalini as we’ll do
later on with closing our eyes.

31:32.210 --> 31:40.929
Then you have to take it to your heart.

31:40.929 --> 31:48.810
And then you have to take your hand in the
corner of your neck and your shoulder and

31:48.810 --> 31:51.440
turn your head to your right.

31:51.440 --> 31:59.450
Now this is the center I was talking about
which is always very much caught up, because

31:59.450 --> 32:02.640
we feel guilty.

32:02.640 --> 32:08.239
And is the worst center, because it causes
horrible diseases like angina, spondylitis

32:08.239 --> 32:10.350
- all kinds of headaches.

32:10.350 --> 32:20.370
So please put your hand as far as possible
on the back and turn your head to your right.

32:20.370 --> 32:29.899
Now this hand again is brought onto the forehead
across – as we put it sometimes for our

32:29.899 --> 32:32.450
headache, and press it on both the sides.

32:32.450 --> 32:35.870
This is the center of forgiveness.

32:35.870 --> 32:43.070
Then we take back our hand and put it on the
backside of our head and push our head on

32:43.070 --> 32:47.679
top and look up.

32:47.679 --> 32:58.880
Now, this is the center for asking forgiveness
without counting your mistakes, your guilts

32:58.880 --> 33:00.899
and all kinds of condemnations.

33:00.899 --> 33:08.230
Then you stretch your hand, stretch your hand
and put the left hand with the center of your

33:08.230 --> 33:20.750
palm, you put the center of your palm, bend
your head in the - on the fontanel bone area,

33:20.750 --> 33:24.399
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

33:24.399 --> 33:35.510
Just adjust it properly and then push back
your fingers, press it hard and move your

33:35.510 --> 33:45.370
scalp very slowly seven times.

33:45.370 --> 33:51.299
Very slowly, clockwise.

33:51.299 --> 33:54.570
All this we have to do just now closing our
eyes.

33:54.570 --> 34:02.250
Just we have to close our eyes, because our
attention has to go inside.

34:02.250 --> 34:11.250
Please put your left hand towards Me.

34:11.250 --> 34:21.940
And you can take out your spectacles, would
be better because your eyes also are helped.

34:21.940 --> 34:28.330
Now, please put your right hand on your heart
and left hand towards Me with both the legs

34:28.330 --> 34:32.140
apart from each other, not for the sitting
people but otherwise.

34:32.140 --> 34:42.930
Now, at this point you have to ask Me a questions
three times, a very important question.

34:42.930 --> 34:48.840
You can call Me Shri Mataji or you can call
Me Mother, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

34:48.840 --> 34:51.010
Ask this question three times.

34:51.010 --> 35:00.590
It’s a computer-style of meditation, so
ask a question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

35:00.590 --> 35:03.040
Ask this question three times.

35:03.040 --> 35:16.740
You are not to be diffident about anything
at this moment.

35:16.740 --> 35:31.590
Now - if you are the Spirit you are also the
master, so take down your hand in the upper

35:31.590 --> 35:37.680
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side
and press it hard which is the center of mastery

35:37.680 --> 35:43.630
and ask another question three times, “Mother,
am I my own master?”

35:43.630 --> 35:53.120
Please ask this question three times, “Mother,
am I my own master?

35:53.120 --> 35:56.480
Mother, am I my own master?”

35:56.480 --> 36:06.410
Please ask this question - within your heart.

36:06.410 --> 36:14.570
Now, please take your hand in the lower portion
of your abdomen on the left-hand side and

36:14.570 --> 36:18.840
press it hard.

36:18.840 --> 36:26.850
As I told you this is the center of pure knowledge
but I cannot force you to accept pure knowledge,

36:26.850 --> 36:28.490
it cannot be done.

36:28.490 --> 36:34.030
So you have to ask for it in your freedom
and glory.

36:34.030 --> 36:43.070
So please say six times, because this petal
has got - this center has got six petals,

36:43.070 --> 36:56.270
so please say it six times, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge.”

36:56.270 --> 37:09.030
Please ask six times.

37:09.030 --> 37:17.810
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the
Kundalini starts moving and so we have to

37:17.810 --> 37:22.730
help the other centers to be opened out with
our right hand.

37:22.730 --> 37:33.740
So we put our right hand in the upper portion
of our abdomen on the left-hand side and here

37:33.740 --> 37:47.400
we say with full confidence to open this center
of mastery ten times, we say it ten times,

37:47.400 --> 37:53.290
“Mother, I am my own master.

37:53.290 --> 38:09.850
Mother, I am my own master”, we say it ten
times.

38:09.850 --> 38:29.970
Now, one has to know the truth and the truth
is, you are not this body, you are not this

38:29.970 --> 38:39.720
mind, you are not this intelligence, you are
not your ego nor your conditioning - you are

38:39.720 --> 38:43.460
the pure Spirit.

38:43.460 --> 38:57.300
So please raise your right hand on your heart
and say with full confidence twelve times

38:57.300 --> 39:09.330
- please say it with full confidence - twelve
times, “Mother, I am the Spirit.

39:09.330 --> 39:23.610
Mother, I am the Spirit.”

39:23.610 --> 39:36.830
Now one has to know that the Divine is the
ocean of bliss and joy, it is the ocean of

39:36.830 --> 39:44.660
love and compassion, but above all it is the
ocean of forgiveness.

39:44.660 --> 39:55.240
And we cannot do anything that cannot be dissolved
by this ocean of forgiveness.

39:55.240 --> 40:03.680
So now raise your hand in the corner of your
neck and your shoulder, as far as back you

40:03.680 --> 40:10.570
can take it, and turn your head to your right.

40:10.570 --> 40:22.580
Here with full confidence you have to say
sixteen times, with full confidence, sixteen

40:22.580 --> 40:29.160
times you have to say, “Mother - Mother
I’m not guilty at all.”

40:29.160 --> 40:31.330
Please say it sixteen times.

40:31.330 --> 40:34.600
“Mother, I’m not guilty at all.”

40:34.600 --> 40:38.790
And don’t think, “How can I say and how
can I not say.”

40:38.790 --> 40:42.320
Let your Kundalini judge you, you should not
judge yourself.

40:42.320 --> 41:06.260
Please say it sixteen times with full confidence.

41:06.260 --> 41:19.910
Now - sixteen times.

41:19.910 --> 41:28.170
We have to know, the greatest weapon we have
is that we can forgive others.

41:28.170 --> 41:38.120
When we forgive others we get out of the clutches
of other people and the Divine looks after

41:38.120 --> 41:39.850
them.

41:39.850 --> 41:48.430
So please now raise your hand onto your forehead
and bend your head and press it hard on both

41:48.430 --> 41:49.890
the sides.

41:49.890 --> 41:59.270
Bend your head and press it hard on both the
sides.

41:59.270 --> 42:07.930
Here you have to say from your heart, not
how many times but from your heart, genuinely

42:07.930 --> 42:11.330
please say, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

42:11.330 --> 42:16.530
Please say that, “Mother, I forgive everyone.”

42:16.530 --> 42:23.900
It’s very simple to say, just you have to
say it.

42:23.900 --> 42:34.530
Earnestly from your heart, please say.

42:34.530 --> 42:45.660
Now take back your hand on the backside of
your head and push back your head.

42:45.660 --> 42:49.150
Rest on the hand.

42:49.150 --> 43:00.850
Here – without feeling guilty, without finding
faults with you, without counting how many

43:00.850 --> 43:06.970
mistakes you have committed – for your own
satisfaction, in general you have to say,

43:06.970 --> 43:12.510
“Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes
please forgive.

43:12.510 --> 43:17.660
Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes please
forgive.”

43:17.660 --> 43:23.600
From your heart.

43:23.600 --> 43:28.660
Not how many times, but from your heart.

43:28.660 --> 43:40.330
Now, please stretch your hand and put the
center of your palm on the soft bone that

43:40.330 --> 43:48.640
you have, on top of your head when you were
a child, press it hard, push back your fingers,

43:48.640 --> 43:52.260
press the scalp and move it slowly.

43:52.260 --> 43:58.610
But here again, I cannot force Self Realization
on you, you have to ask for it.

43:58.610 --> 44:09.880
You have to ask for self-enlightenment, so
please say, “Mother, please give me my Self

44:09.880 --> 44:11.040
Realization.”

44:11.040 --> 44:23.750
Seven times, when you move your scalp seven
times clockwise, please.

44:23.750 --> 44:58.160
(Shri Mataji blows eight times into the microphone.)

44:58.160 --> 45:14.980
Now take down your hand, put down both, put
your hands towards Me, both of them and open

45:14.980 --> 45:20.290
your eyes slowly.

45:20.290 --> 45:24.820
Watch Me without thinking, you can do it.

45:24.820 --> 45:29.980
Now put the right hand towards Me and see
for yourself, bend your head, and see for

45:29.980 --> 45:36.520
yourself if there’s a Cool Breeze coming
out of your fontanel bone area.

45:36.520 --> 45:38.710
Just see for yourself.

45:38.710 --> 45:46.380
You have to certify yourself, I’m not going
to say anything, just see yourself.

45:46.380 --> 45:51.310
Bend your head - better to be seen this way.

45:51.310 --> 45:54.830
Now, not to – be close to your [ head ?]. Little
higher.

45:54.830 --> 46:00.270
You have to put it little higher.

46:00.270 --> 46:04.010
See for yourself if there is – some people
get it very much away.

46:04.010 --> 46:07.860
Just see, some people will get hot air, doesn’t
matter.

46:07.860 --> 46:11.714
The heat has to come out, then the Cool Breeze
starts coming.

46:11.714 --> 46:12.714
Now, put the left hand towards Me.

46:12.714 --> 46:18.210
With the right hand you try to feel the Cool
Breeze.

46:18.210 --> 46:41.510
Now – again - at last, put again the left
hand - little further.

46:41.510 --> 46:52.510
See for yourself if there is a Cool Breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

46:52.510 --> 46:53.510
Hmm.

46:53.510 --> 47:03.580
Now, you put your both the hands towards the
sky and look up.

47:03.580 --> 47:09.530
Ask a question, anyone of these questions,
three times, “Mother, is this the Cool Breeze

47:09.530 --> 47:11.790
of the Holy Ghost?

47:11.790 --> 47:19.080
Mother, is this the all-pervading Power of
God’s Love?

47:19.080 --> 47:27.050
Mother is this the Brahma Chaitanya?”

47:27.050 --> 47:33.110
Ask this question three times.

47:33.110 --> 47:39.200
Now please take down your hands.

47:39.200 --> 47:43.810
Now see, if you are feeling the Cool Breeze
in your hands.

47:43.810 --> 47:50.040
Now watch, there is no tree moving, no leaf
- not a single leaf is moving.

47:50.040 --> 47:53.950
They’re all watching you, if you are feeling
the Cool Breeze.

47:53.950 --> 47:55.450
There is no air-conditioning or anything.

47:55.450 --> 48:07.280
Now all those who have felt the Cool Breeze
in their hands or out of their head – or

48:07.280 --> 48:09.300
heat – please raise your hands.

48:09.300 --> 48:11.070
Both the hands.

48:11.070 --> 48:14.730
Oh My God.

48:14.730 --> 48:20.820
Oh, may God bless you.

48:20.820 --> 48:27.050
What a place Cincinnati is, really what a
place, so many seekers.

48:27.050 --> 48:35.950
I really bow to you all very much and next
time I’m going to come here for more time

48:35.950 --> 48:38.330
to be with you.

48:38.330 --> 48:39.620
So heartening.

48:39.620 --> 48:44.260
May God bless you!

48:44.260 --> 48:51.000
We have a follow-on course and they are going
to look after you.

48:51.000 --> 48:55.100
Those who have not felt also Cool Breeze will
feel.

48:55.100 --> 48:59.230
Everybody can feel it.

48:59.230 --> 49:03.350
And only thing is, it is beyond your thought.

49:03.350 --> 49:08.190
So you can’t argue it out, you cannot think
about it.

49:08.190 --> 49:12.440
Try to remain in thoughtless awareness.

49:12.440 --> 49:22.600
Please come and see these people and they
will definitely help you out to fix your connections.

49:22.600 --> 49:26.090
In any case I would like to meet you, if you
want to shake hands with Me – I’ll be

49:26.090 --> 49:27.090
very happy.

49:27.090 --> 49:28.090
Thank you!

49:28.090 --> 49:31.430
Aside: Please, can you remove this?

49:31.430 --> 49:37.150
So many people now, what to say?

49:37.150 --> 49:43.500
(Shri Mataji laughing) Tremendous, they are
tremendous!

49:43.500 --> 49:48.210
YOGI: You want the microphones off?

49:48.210 --> 49:54.470
SHRI MATAJI: Ah?

49:54.470 --> 49:58.640
No, no.

49:58.640 --> 50:02.810
No more.
