00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.590
What about the effects on your health?

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.959
This is a very interesting study from Doctor
Ramesh Manocha from Australia and he tested

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:19.330
350 Sahaja Yoga meditators, and he compared
them to a group of people.

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.590
A mixed group who practice all sorts of meditation.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.310
Hatha Yoga, Mindfulness Meditation - and so
on - and the Australian norm - and the norm

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.500
consists of thousands of people.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.480
What he found is the Sahaja Yoga meditators
were better in their general health, in the

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.940
social function and in their mental health.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.420
They weren't better in their physical function
but that's because Sahaja Yoga is not a sport.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.390
Then he tested what is it that makes them
better?

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.109
So he tested: Is it the hours they meditate?

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:52.899
Is it the amount of mantras they say?

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.519
Is it how many meetings they attend?

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:01.539
Nothing was related to the benefits other
than one thing.

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:04.199
That was the frequency of the mental silence.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.650
So, this is what works.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:12.320
And here you see the National Average, here
you see people who meditate but they only

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.140
become thoughtless less than once per month.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.170
They have no benefit.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.990
Here are the ones who are thoughtless once
or twice per month.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:21.250
No benefit.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:26.420
But here are the ones who are once or twice
thoughtless - and you see they are significantly

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.049
better in their mental health than the National
Average.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.479
Here are the ones who are once or twice per
day thoughtless - they are also much better,

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:41.009
and the ones who are thoughtless several times
per day, have an amazing mental health, as

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.570
you can see here.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.460
So in conclusion, it's the state of mental
silence which works.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.840
Nothing else.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.840
But what this means also, it means if you
meditate, you need to find a meditation which

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.399
teaches you how to achieve the state of mental
silence, otherwise you have no health benefits.

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.409
He found exactly the same on general health.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.899
So this is physical and mental health so exactly
the same.

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.179
This is the average - these are people who
are thoughtless several times per day, a significant

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:15.410
improvement of their general health and so
on.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.540
And then here, the same, if you meditate for
years and you never go thoughtless, you may

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.770
also not have benefits so you have to try
a bit harder to get there.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.890
Then he measured exactly the same on a questionnaire
which picks up anxiety and depression in the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.880
population.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:39.030
What he found is the Yogis were significantly
less distressed on this questionnaire, so

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.990
they were far less likely to be anxious and
depressed.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.540
Again, the benefits were associated with the
frequency of the thoughtless awareness.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.800
So here you can see those who are several
times per day thoughtless, they are in the

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.800
very low risk category so these people will
never become depressed or anxious.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.310
Then it goes down, so the less often you achieve
thoughtless awareness, the less protected

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.310
you are against depression and anxiety.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:16.550
This is a study by Simon Gulocheiki where
he looked at the personality of Yogis vs personality

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.820
of non-Yogis.

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.810
He found that the meditators are significantly
less depressed, significantly less neurotic,

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.090
have less paranoid thoughts, are less anxious,
and less difficulties in identifying and expressing

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.050
emotions.

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.350
So these are the long-term effects.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:41.540
So in conclusion, Sahaja Yoga meditation has
a significant effect on your health, but the

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.370
benefits are associated with the state of
mental silence, so that's the key thing and

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:48.360
that's what you should be aiming for.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.170
The more often, the better.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.680
Now, what are the effects on the illness?
