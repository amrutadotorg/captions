1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,960
Today we have gathered here to do Guru puja.
This system started long time back in India,

2
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:25,250
I think even at the time of Patanjali, maybe
even earlier, when there were great seekers.

3
00:00:30,290 --> 00:00:37,290
And their gurus were sitting in the jungles,
where they used to get permission to go there

4
00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:47,190
and then they would get their realisation,
very few of them, one or two. So we had many

5
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,190
rishis and munis in the olden times in India.
So this system of guru started. Also one of

6
00:00:57,749 --> 00:01:04,749
the reasons is that, that there is no organised
religion in India. There’s no popes, there

7
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:12,430
are no priests, nothing like them. They have
priests just for worshipping in the temples.

8
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:22,970
But for giving realisation, for talking about
higher life, they all had to go to very great

9
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:36,310
realised souls. And it was absolutely the
freedom of the guru, whom to accept whom not

10
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:44,259
to accept. And everybody was tested thoroughly
by the guru if they are capable of achieving

11
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,259
Self-realisation or not. And this test was
so hard, so difficult, and also to a point

12
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:07,299
of cruelty, that very few could pass through
that test.

13
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:14,299
It’s not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is
a Sahaja Yogi, it’s not like that. That,

14
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:21,710
of course, made it a very narrow margin for
people to achieve their realisation and these

15
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:31,970
gurus never used to leave their own seats,
they call it takiya (meaning: pillow). They

16
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:37,760
would be there in their own place, all those
who would like to go to him could come. If

17
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:44,760
he allowed, then only they can meet him. You
may go on for miles together, nothing, no

18
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:53,090
obligations of the guru that he should meet
you. Perhaps they didn’t feel that love

19
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:05,650
and compassion for the seekers. They didn’t
understand that the seekers are ardently seeking

20
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:16,560
the truth and they should not suffer. That
may be the reason they were not so much concerned.

21
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,280
All the time they were testing their disciple.
Even Ramdas, who was the guru of Shivaji,

22
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,740
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,
though he was a born realised.

23
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,370
So to get this Gurupada, to the position of
a guru, after that they had to work very,

24
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:52,370
very hard to achieve a state of a saint. But
in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case, as you

25
00:03:58,240 --> 00:04:05,240
know. I just thought – if people get their
realisation, they’ll see for themselves

26
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:13,490
what’s wrong with them, they will introspect
themselves and will try to correct themselves.

27
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:20,490
It is true, for many, many people, but some
of them still are lingering behind and are

28
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:27,919
going on and on and on thinking that they
are Sahaja Yogis, they have achieved a lot,

29
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,919
they are something very special. So this delusion
is all the time is creating this problem.

30
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:44,789
This delusion makes them very narrow minded,
selfish, self-centred, and people can’t

31
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,280
believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis.

32
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:02,259
So the first and foremost thing we have to
know that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out

33
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:09,259
because Paramchaitanya is transmitting compassion,
It never did before, It never had that kind

34
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:18,930
of an attitude which it is there because I
am a Mother. And this compassion has worked

35
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:27,830
it this way that: you all have got your realisation,
you have achieved a state which we can call

36
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:35,360
as a Self-realised souls. But still, because
you got it so easily, cheaply, I think still

37
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:46,719
we don’t realise what we have got. Still
we do not practice meditation, introspection

38
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:58,150
and dedication. Some are very much there,
but mostly we are just living in the idea

39
00:06:00,379 --> 00:06:05,029
that we have already achieved.

40
00:06:05,029 --> 00:06:12,029
So, the first thing we should introspect:
Are we concerned about ourselves? All the

41
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:26,710
time do we think that we are suffering, we
have this problem, that problem, or this should

42
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,710
be done, that should be done. If the attention
is on that, that all the time you are worried

43
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:42,340
about yourself, then you cannot break, you
cannot break through this shell of your being,

44
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:54,889
which is under the domination of your mental
selfishness or self-centredness. Even self-centredness

45
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,349
is absolutely against your growth.

46
00:07:02,349 --> 00:07:09,129
There are many people who come, I have seen,
even to Cabella, I know they have to suffer

47
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:16,129
a lot because they think it’s a very open
space where they have to live and they must

48
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,259
make all arrangements to make themselves comfortable.
Such people have to grow still much more.

49
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:28,259
For a saint, any place has to be heavenly.
You must have seen Me enjoying everything.

50
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:39,180
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere.
I have no demands of any kind. But if you

51
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:46,180
are worried about your body comforts or your
body troubles then still you are at a body

52
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:55,110
level, which you have to transcend. Worried
about how you look, how you dress up, what

53
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:05,719
sort of things you have to wear: all this
makes you yet not a good Sahaja Yogi. This

54
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:21,050
is one style of Sahaja Yogis who still want
very great comforts.

55
00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:28,129
So, what you have to do, if you are used to
comforts: try to go and sleep on the street.

56
00:08:31,889 --> 00:08:38,889
I will not do that, but you can do it. Or
sleep on a tree, you may fall down doesn’t

57
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:49,290
matter (laughter). Do all kinds of things
that are necessary to punish your body to

58
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:58,060
understand that you are not bound with this
comfort of the body. This is one of the greatest

59
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,600
things one has to see, that you are not bound
by your body. It’s alright if you have comfort,

60
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:14,780
well and good, if you don’t have, well and
good. For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important

61
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:21,780
that he should be able to live like a saint.
Not necessarily that you should become a sanyasi,

62
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:30,820
but from inside your body should be such that
you can dominate your body. How can you not

63
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:39,460
sleep anywhere? Why can you not sleep anywhere?

64
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:46,460
Then also, that they want to have a very comfortable
arrangements about bathrooms, this, that.

65
00:09:54,950 --> 00:10:01,240
All these ideas are there because you are
very self-conscious but not superconsciousness,

66
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:08,240
it’s not there. You want to have everything
first class, and anybody who tries to interfere

67
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:14,910
with that kind of a thing, you don’t like
it. I can understand a person who is very

68
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:21,910
old – he cannot manage things, he has to
have a certain amount of body comfort, but

69
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:32,180
even young people these days are extremely
comfort-oriented. That is not for Sahaja Yoga.

70
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,650
Of course I’ve seen people in the West are
better off in this matter. Because when they

71
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:50,650
go to India they told Me they like [Maharashtra]
S.T. buses better than comfortable buses.

72
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:55,290
So I said “Why?” “Because Mother, you
can jump in the bus nicely with all the luggage,”

73
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:01,370
(due to lack of suspension and bumps in road)
“Because the windows are open, you can breathe.

74
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:08,250
Very natural, very good“. And they wanted
to go on bullock carts also. I mean they enjoy

75
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,790
all that.

76
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,330
Actually if you see you’ll notice, in the
Western World mostly, people are taking to

77
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:22,330
a more rustic life. They are enjoying more
the rustic style of life than to this so-called

78
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:29,450
comfortable, artificial life. Not so much
Indians, I would say, also Malaysians. I think

79
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:38,160
most of the people I have met in the Western
countries are really great because they can

80
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,590
sleep anywhere, they can eat anything. You
ask them “How did you like the food?”

81
00:11:45,590 --> 00:11:52,590
“What did we eat, I don’t know Mother?”
That is the sign. That is the sign of a person

82
00:11:54,180 --> 00:12:01,180
who is not bothered as to what he is eating,
what he’s getting, what is his taste, “I

83
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:09,170
like this, I like that,” these words drop
out.

84
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:16,170
It’s not difficult, it’s not difficult,
you might think that I am asking you to something,

85
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:23,150
hazardous thing, you see. It’s not difficult
at all, because if you have to impress the

86
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:30,150
people around you, you have to be like a saint.
And if you are a fussy person, if you are

87
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,720
a fusspot, then you cannot impress others
that you have got Self-realisation.

88
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:44,640
Many people tell Me “Mother, people had
to do so much: to go to Himalayas, do this,

89
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:50,040
do that, and then they got their realisation.
How is it these people you have blessed?”

90
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:57,040
Even some great saints asked Me that. “What
right they had to get their realisation? Why

91
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,930
did you give them realisation? What have they
achieved?” I said “Only their desire.

92
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:09,060
Their desire was very much there that they
should get their Self-realisation and that’s

93
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,670
how they got it“.

94
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:18,670
But now to go into only desire, is not sufficient.
You have to depend on yourself, on the light

95
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,250
of your Spirit you should see what’s wrong
with you. This is a very important thing.

96
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:37,250
Ask questions to yourself. “Why do I want
this? Why do I need this? What is the purpose?”

97
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:45,240
Because as you have seen, all the rest of
the world is mad, [we] call it mad, because

98
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:52,240
they are running after stupid things, they
are wanting things which has no meaning to

99
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,800
spirituality.

100
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,800
So spirituality itself should be self-satisfying.
If you are spiritually endowed, then you are

101
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:12,460
self-satisfied. And this self-satisfaction
within you will lead you to that Ocean of

102
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:20,410
Joy about which I have been telling you and
all the scriptures have described. For Sahaja

103
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,600
Yogis, the word we use is nirananda. Nirananda
means: A joyous state, where nothing is needed.

104
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:44,020
Joy itself is joy. You are enjoying only joy.
Nothing is needed to make you happy. You are

105
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:53,110
happy because of joy that you have, in the
nirananda state.

106
00:14:53,620 --> 00:15:00,620
If you go and see how these saints lived,
you will be amazed. How they managed their

107
00:15:01,510 --> 00:15:08,510
life, you’ll be very much amazed. How many
days they used to fast, without food. Never

108
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:14,610
bothered! They never thought it was fasting.
They just used to think, “We have no food,

109
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:20,480
so no, don’t eat.” Of course, you don’t
have to go through [that], you have got your

110
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:27,480
realisation. So now you have a power to achieve
this mastery. Now, you have this power.

111
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,240
The another thing I have noticed about Sahaja
Yogis, some of them have grudges about others.

112
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:45,930
Sahaja Yoga is the blessings of love, blessings
of compassion. There is no place for any kind

113
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:05,860
of hatred, or any kind of revenge, or anger
among Sahaja Yogis. If you have that, you

114
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,720
must conquer it. Is a good chance, if you
find somebody who is very hot-tempered, who

115
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:29,000
is a very angry type, go and make friends
with that person. Just see if you can carry

116
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:36,620
on with that person or not. If there’s a
fusspot, also make friends with such a fusspot,

117
00:16:36,620 --> 00:16:43,620
and see that you achieve that peace which
will keep you above all kinds of hatred, all

118
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,710
kinds of temper, which is a very bad thing.

119
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:59,000
But some Sahaja Yogis lose their temper very
fast. I would say that they cannot be Sahaja

120
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,000
Yogis, because if you have no control over
your anger, then how are you powerful of compassion

121
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:15,669
and love? But you don’t even have to control
it – just there. Once you have it, or that

122
00:17:16,789 --> 00:17:23,789
state, then you just watch and see. In the
olden days, the saints ,mostly, used to be

123
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:33,350
very much angry type people. They couldn’t
bear the stupidity of the world and they used

124
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:39,600
to be very, very angry type and they used
to run away from people.

125
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:46,600
I know of a saint, Nityanandswami, who always
lived on the tree, and anybody tried to come

126
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:54,480
near him, he used to throw stones at. Couldn’t
bear the people who were all heated up and

127
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:02,320
coming to him. But you don’t need that,
you have a way of achieving love and affection

128
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:11,450
of the people who seem to be very, very troublesome
and grudging type or maybe some people who

129
00:18:12,999 --> 00:18:19,999
are very aggressive. This is not a difficult
task if you try a little bit the other way

130
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:25,789
round. Mostly people, when they find somebody
who is a very hot-tempered person, they run

131
00:18:25,789 --> 00:18:32,789
away from them. They don’t want to have
anything to do [with them]. Those who are

132
00:18:33,090 --> 00:18:40,090
not hot-tempered, those who are good nature,
you can always be friendly, what is so great

133
00:18:40,999 --> 00:18:47,999
about it? What is so nice about it? What is
so sweet about it? But how you speak to the

134
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:05,080
person, how you talk to that person, how you
manage that person: your love will definitely

135
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:13,360
melt him down, because he’s a Sahaja Yogi,
I’m not saying for non-sahaja yogis. Sahaja

136
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,360
Yogis as they are, you have to be extremely
compassionate and affectionate and love.

137
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:34,960
Another thing which is extremely important
for us to know, that we have got this realisation

138
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:43,549
through Mother’s love. Only My compassion
has acted, only the power of Mother’s compassion

139
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:51,230
could have worked it out. Now, even if this
love is flowing towards the stones, or towards

140
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:59,899
the mountains or towards anything which is
very solid, the ripples come back, they have

141
00:20:03,029 --> 00:20:10,029
to come back. In the same way, you people
now, who have got realisation, have to know

142
00:20:10,169 --> 00:20:17,169
that compassion and love is the only power
you have got, nothing else.

143
00:20:17,590 --> 00:20:24,590
If you love yourself, if you care for yourself,
you care for your family and care for your

144
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:34,090
children – then you haven’t achieved much.
You’re only worried about yourself, because

145
00:20:35,789 --> 00:20:42,789
that’s your limited area where you move.
But if you can break that and find out places

146
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:54,340
where you have to express your love, you can.
As they say, the water finds it’s own level.

147
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:04,960
In the same way, this compassion has to flow
to all the places, to all the ditches everywhere,

148
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:12,850
and should find its own level. But if you
are just satisfied with yourself and you are

149
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:20,570
not bothered, you are just trying to believe
that you are a great soul because, you are

150
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:30,110
a Sahaja Yogi, then I must say, that you are
sadly mistaken.

151
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:37,460
In this lifetime, you can achieve that state.
In this lifetime, you can get to that state

152
00:21:40,700 --> 00:21:42,110
within yourself.

153
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:49,110
Now, the third thing that troubles Sahaja
Yogis is that, “Mother we want God’s realisation,”

154
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:57,279
that makes Me laugh. You see, it is already
there, already there. Like once you get into

155
00:21:59,909 --> 00:22:04,929
the sea and you say “Mother, we want to
go to the bottom of the sea,” you can always

156
00:22:04,929 --> 00:22:11,929
go, just slip, and you will be there. In the
same way, once you have developed a kind of

157
00:22:14,789 --> 00:22:21,789
a Self-realisation and have jumped into the
ocean of this compassion, there’s no need

158
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:28,990
to achieve anything. The sense of achievement,
“I should be that, I should be this,”

159
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:35,990
is all coming from your human haunting. That
should be over. Now you are Godly people.

160
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,679
So you should not think, “I should achieve
this state, I should achieve that state,”

161
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:47,769
but just go on slipping, just giving up all
the weights that you have in your heads and

162
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:54,769
it will work out. This is what I have been
saying to you that: you have to dissolve yourself

163
00:22:56,309 --> 00:23:00,690
into the compassion.

164
00:23:00,690 --> 00:23:07,690
Also, there are still very people who want
to be in the front. Specially Indians will

165
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:16,710
all sit together in front, I’ve seen that
way. They have no right, they have no right

166
00:23:18,629 --> 00:23:25,629
to sit in front. Nobody has right to sit in
front or to seek a place. They should sit

167
00:23:27,869 --> 00:23:34,869
wherever they get seat to sit down with complete
satisfaction. Whether you sit in front or

168
00:23:37,009 --> 00:23:44,009
at that corner, even in the darkness, you
can get My vibrations, you can get everything.

169
00:23:45,690 --> 00:23:52,690
So to be prominent, to sit some place where
you are prominent, is not necessary. What

170
00:23:53,519 --> 00:24:00,519
is it in a prominence, what do you get? To
be lost into the crowds, to be lost into the

171
00:24:04,139 --> 00:24:11,139
Ocean of Love is the main thing. All these
are mythical that, we should somehow or other

172
00:24:13,269 --> 00:24:20,269
get the front place. You see as Marathi apan
manto (We say), “Samor chi zaaga patkauli

173
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:32,610
mi!” means “I have managed to get the
front seat!” Front will be the back, and

174
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,299
back will be the front.

175
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:45,299
It is very surprising how still people are
trying to achieve something so nonsensical.

176
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:55,929
So where is your mind, where is your attention,
what are you thinking? If you are thoughtless

177
00:24:55,929 --> 00:25:02,929
you will be satisfied, you will be happy,
you will not ask for anything, you’ll not

178
00:25:03,470 --> 00:25:10,470
want anything. What is there to have? What
is so important? All these ideas come from

179
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:16,429
ignorance, I must tell you, from ignorance.

180
00:25:16,429 --> 00:25:23,429
Once this ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ fellow
came to Me. And he said that “We have heard

181
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:29,700
you are a great saint, this thing, that thing,
and you have all the comforts of life – you

182
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:36,700
have everything here, very nice, this thing,
that. So, how are you a saint?” I said “How

183
00:25:38,119 --> 00:25:45,119
are you a saint?” [He said] “I have given
up my family, I have given up my cars, I have

184
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:53,309
given up my house, I have given up my children.”
I said “One more thing you have given up”,

185
00:25:55,970 --> 00:26:02,970
he said “What?” I said “Your brains!!”
(laughter and applause) So he said, “How

186
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:13,519
do you say we have given up our brains?”
I said, “Very simple, I’ve given up nothing,

187
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:19,899
because I am holding nothing! What is there
to give up when you are not holding anything?

188
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:26,899
Now, I would say in this house, or on my body,
anywhere, [if] you think you can find anything

189
00:26:28,119 --> 00:26:35,119
equal to the dust particle of Shri Krishna,
you can take it. Should be equal though.”

190
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:45,960
Now they started looking here and there. I
said “Then what have you given up? Just

191
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:52,509
stones? What have you given? Why are you boasting
about giving up that, and giving up this and

192
00:26:52,509 --> 00:26:58,279
giving up…?” They even shaved their head.

193
00:26:58,279 --> 00:27:04,850
All these useless ideas, that “We have done
this, we have done that.” Anybody in Sahaja

194
00:27:04,850 --> 00:27:11,850
Yoga who thinks he is doing a lot of work
for Sahaja Yoga, should give up completely!

195
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:18,850
That’s the sign of another ignorance. If
you are part and parcel of the Ocean, everything

196
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:27,720
is done by Ocean, you are doing nothing. To
have such ideas about yourself shows how little

197
00:27:29,139 --> 00:27:36,139
you know about your Self. You are the Ocean.
And if you are the Ocean how can you claim

198
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:41,929
“I’ve touched this shore, I have touched
that shore, I have touched this shore“?

199
00:27:41,929 --> 00:27:48,929
No more “I” is left. Once this I-ness
drops out then only the Universal Being within

200
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:54,679
you shines.

201
00:27:54,679 --> 00:28:01,679
All these things are so clearly evident in
our characters. Some people are very identified,

202
00:28:08,590 --> 00:28:15,590
say with their country, or maybe with their
worshipping style, whatever it is. All these

203
00:28:18,639 --> 00:28:25,029
mis-identifications have to be given up. It
is very difficult for people because they

204
00:28:25,029 --> 00:28:32,029
are so conditioned, and as long as you have
conditioning you cannot rise above your mind,

205
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:39,480
which is a myth, you cannot. Now, try to understand,
what your conditionings are.

206
00:28:46,379 --> 00:28:52,619
One of them, I would say, I have seen and
I am so surprised, you go to the Western countries,

207
00:28:52,619 --> 00:28:59,619
all of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha.
They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha. Shri

208
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:06,399
Ganesha’s photographs, Shri Ganesha’s
everything, children also. And now I have

209
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,799
seen that vibrations stop! Why should they
stop? Why should Ganesha stop the vibrations?

210
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,149
Why they are doing it, I realised, was because
I said Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ.

211
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:26,149
Their identification is with Christ and Christianity,
in a very subtle way. So all the vibrations

212
00:29:29,639 --> 00:29:36,639
stopped! Imagine with Shri Ganesha’s music,
we heard in one of the Eastern Block countries,

213
00:29:38,759 --> 00:29:44,369
and all the vibrations had stopped and they
were singing all the songs of Shri Ganesha

214
00:29:44,369 --> 00:29:51,369
and not one song of Sahaja Yoga, leave alone
about the Guru, not once. So, even there is

215
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:01,960
a very subtle identification.

216
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:08,960
There was one fellow in Russia, supposed to
be very intelligent, he said that “Alright,

217
00:30:12,139 --> 00:30:18,629
if we keep Mother’s photograph and also
the icons, we can get the same type of vibrations.”

218
00:30:18,629 --> 00:30:25,629
You cannot, because icons are made by some
artist’s imaginary. These are not representing

219
00:30:28,009 --> 00:30:35,009
actually even Maria or Christ or anyone, they
are all imaginary. If Italian ones make Christ,

220
00:30:37,179 --> 00:30:44,179
he is Italian style, if some French one makes
it, he is thin like French, if you get somebody

221
00:30:49,809 --> 00:30:56,809
say from Holland, he will have a forehead
like that. You see all of them they depict

222
00:30:58,489 --> 00:31:05,489
Christ as they want to. Then we have Maria
the same way, Her expression, her photograph,

223
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:14,450
everything, is all according to the imagination
of the artist and to whatever country he belongs,

224
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,869
that he will do.

225
00:31:18,869 --> 00:31:24,859
And they are not free, you can see they are
not free, because all these artists have a

226
00:31:24,859 --> 00:31:31,489
certain style. Now if it is Rembrandt, it’s
a style, if it is, say Leonardo, it’s a

227
00:31:31,489 --> 00:31:38,489
style. Though they are born realised, still
they have a style. Nobody is like this, that

228
00:31:39,129 --> 00:31:46,129
he’ll make today like this, tomorrow like
that: there’s no freedom. They are bound

229
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:54,059
by their own styles. Everybody has one style,
and that is the style they follow. Because,

230
00:31:54,059 --> 00:32:01,059
what is the reason, the reason is, they must
have done 3 or 4 types of styles, they must

231
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:09,629
have done, surely, but people must have rejected,
“This is no good, this is no good,” so

232
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:16,200
it is all the opinion of the people. So they
must have taken to one style: alright this

233
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,789
is the style.

234
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:24,789
So you can see Christ if he’s Japanese,
he’ll have chinky eyes, if he’s Chinese,

235
00:32:26,269 --> 00:32:33,269
he’ll have no nose, if it’s Indian, he’ll
be dark. So all kinds of Christs I have seen

236
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:45,809
and I feel that, how can they emit vibrations?
Tell me. While with my photograph, how can

237
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:53,859
you compare? Also, cameras were to be developed
at this time: do you notice that point? Cameras

238
00:32:53,859 --> 00:33:00,859
were developed at this time, not before that.
This loudspeaker was not developed before

239
00:33:02,379 --> 00:33:08,609
this. Aeroplanes were not developed before.
I have been travelling for 19 days, one day

240
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:15,609
in the plane, second day in the public programme.
They could not do all that. Nobody could do

241
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:26,710
this. Neither Shri Krishna, nor anyone. They
could not fly by aeroplane in those days.

242
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:34,029
Now we say we have 65 countries, somebody
says there’s “No, 68 countries” or go

243
00:33:34,029 --> 00:33:41,029
on correcting. But is only possible because
today, today: there are aeroplanes. They were

244
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,580
never there [before].

245
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:50,580
So all these things are – even video, even
the way you are seeing My image there, was

246
00:33:51,710 --> 00:33:58,710
that available before? No. So this is a very
special time, where science has also supported

247
00:34:03,529 --> 00:34:09,840
seekers to find the Truth – science has
supported. We have to be thankful to science:

248
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:16,289
that part of science which has been so much
supportive. Even [if] there was not a car,

249
00:34:16,289 --> 00:34:23,289
I could not have gone up to Milan even! Imagine
going on a bullock cart, what would have happened

250
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:31,010
to Me? So all these things are created today
for you. You were also born in those times

251
00:34:36,530 --> 00:34:43,520
for the special reason. They could not give
realisation because that time you were not

252
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:50,520
there. Very few people of your calibre were
there. But I wonder if you understand your

253
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:52,230
calibre.

254
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:59,230
The way you are sometimes growing, shows that
you don’t understand your calibre. You don’t

255
00:35:03,329 --> 00:35:10,329
know what you are, how much the whole atmosphere
has worked out for you, the science has been

256
00:35:12,299 --> 00:35:19,299
worked out for you. Science is a gift of the
nature. All this has been worked out for you

257
00:35:21,569 --> 00:35:28,569
to achieve the highest state in the shortest
time. But for that, one has to be extremely

258
00:35:33,569 --> 00:35:40,569
introspecting. Instead of thinking of what
you have to achieve: be introspective! This

259
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:50,380
introspection will help you and you will really
become real gurus. When you go to other villages,

260
00:35:55,589 --> 00:36:02,589
other places, other cities, people should
know from your being itself that some great

261
00:36:03,089 --> 00:36:10,089
person has come. You don’t have to tell,
you don’t have to certify, it’s the simplicity

262
00:36:13,339 --> 00:36:17,700
of your temperament itself.

263
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:24,700
First time I went to Leningrad, nobody knew
about Me. No advertisements, nothing, They

264
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:33,210
just put some posters, some. And there were
2,000 people in the hall, 2,000 outside. In

265
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,200
the hall they had to pay, alright. I was wondering
what’s the matter. And when I came out I

266
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:48,750
gave them realisation but I said “You come
tomorrow“. So 2,000 from inside and 2,000

267
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:55,750
from outside and about 2,000 more came, and
we were all sitting on the ground. I was amazed.

268
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:04,180
I said “What made you come to my programme?”
[They] said “Mother, it’s so obvious,

269
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:12,950
your photograph!” Such sensitivity of spirituality:
“So obvious, from your photograph!” And

270
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,780
they were scientists, they were doctors, they
were all kinds of intelligent people. But

271
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:28,780
they could feel the spirituality from the
face. That kind of a sensitivity we should

272
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:37,000
have. When you don’t need any discretion,
nothing, you know: this is this, this is this,

273
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:44,000
this is this. Don’t have to judge, don’t
have to think about it. You cannot say who

274
00:37:48,319 --> 00:37:55,319
will be best fitted for this: those who have
come for the first time, those who have come

275
00:37:57,930 --> 00:38:04,930
later on or those who will be coming, younger
or older, women, men or children. It is there.

276
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:15,809
In my lifetime if I see so many of you, so
much transformed, looking so beautiful, so

277
00:38:15,809 --> 00:38:22,809
nice, creating such a good atmosphere. It’s
more than satisfaction for Me. And sometimes

278
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:30,819
I think there is nothing to be done now anymore
– finished. But then they invite Me here,

279
00:38:30,819 --> 00:38:36,640
and invite Me there, so I’m just doing.
But to be very frank I am over satisfied.

280
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:43,640
Now, once you have planted the tree…it’s
like a mango tree. Once you have planted a

281
00:38:44,490 --> 00:38:51,109
mango tree and looked after it for 3 or 4
years, then it looks after itself. It gives

282
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:58,109
fruits, it doesn’t need any water, nothing,
it just grows by itself. In the same way it

283
00:38:58,849 --> 00:39:05,849
should happen with you. You should grow by
yourself. Of course, you will find people

284
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:13,970
who are stupid, who are aggressive, who are
not at all Sahaja Yogis and trying to be Sahaja

285
00:39:16,770 --> 00:39:23,770
Yogis. You’ll find all kinds. So just see
them, that’s all.

286
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:32,480
In this Guru puja, you have to decide that
what are the criteria. First a Guru has to

287
00:39:38,619 --> 00:39:45,619
be without desires, any desires whatsoever:
nirichcha as they say. There is one false

288
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:59,549
guru in India who said that ” If I had the
powers as Mother has, then I would have become

289
00:39:59,549 --> 00:40:06,549
the king of this world“. So people said
“Then why don’t you become?” Why doesn’t

290
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:12,270
Mother become like that? Why doesn’t She
become the king?” So they said “Because

291
00:40:12,270 --> 00:40:17,400
She is nirichcha- means She has no desires.
A person who has no desires will not become

292
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,809
anything.” So, I said go and tell him “If
you have desires, you cannot have powers also.”

293
00:40:23,809 --> 00:40:30,809
It’s only because you have no desires, that’s
why all these powers are there.

294
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,000
So any desire that comes in your mind, you
should say “Forget it, just forget it.”

295
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:50,680
When the desire is overpowering, you just
divert your attention. Any kind of stupid

296
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:59,789
desire can take charge and how do you become
desireless is by getting to the thoughtless

297
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,839
awareness. Any crisis comes in, you should
be able to rise into that state of thoughtless

298
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:17,279
awareness. Just be peaceful. Look at your
desires with peace. You can tell the desire,

299
00:41:17,279 --> 00:41:24,279
“Oh, I’m very much satisfied, now don’t
come, I don’t want.” That’s how you

300
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:34,700
can become desireless. There is this compassion,
and the compassion that becomes actually the

301
00:41:41,369 --> 00:41:48,369
power. [With] small, small things you can
express your love, very small, small things.

302
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:58,359
In very sweet ways, you can express your love..
Is very important.

303
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:07,160
The whole world needs today love and peace.
And you have to give peace and love to everyone

304
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:15,270
that is possible. Of course [with] Sahaja
Yogis it is very easy, but even non Sahaja

305
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:22,270
Yogis, you must treat them with respect and
love, but you should not have a desire that

306
00:42:24,049 --> 00:42:30,890
you should get back anything from them.
It’s alright, whatever done, is forgotten.

307
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:35,710
You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who came
to Sahaja Yoga have gained so much and have

308
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:42,710
betrayed us – it doesn’t matter, it’s
not important. Because they are going to be

309
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:49,910
losers, not we. So, there’s nothing to bother
about these things.

310
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,160
Then another thing is: try to see that your
mind doesn’t react. Some people have a habit,

311
00:42:59,710 --> 00:43:05,940
or I think most of them have, to react. You
tell them something and they’ll put their

312
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,940
own one tail with it, something. Never will
they accept if somebody says something. If

313
00:43:16,539 --> 00:43:23,539
you are reacting, what will go into your heads?
What will go into your heart? What will go

314
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:30,599
into your attention?
So the reaction itself is a sign of not proper

315
00:43:31,190 --> 00:43:37,770
development within yourself. This attention
which is trying to go into all the areas of

316
00:43:37,770 --> 00:43:44,770
your mind and your body and everywhere, is
not there. It cannot enter, because as soon

317
00:43:46,579 --> 00:43:53,579
as it tries to enter, you shut it by reacting.
You cannot see anything just for seeing sake,

318
00:43:56,220 --> 00:44:02,559
you must react. You say “This is not good,
that’s not good.” If I say “It is 5

319
00:44:02,559 --> 00:44:09,559
o’clock” you’ll say “No! It is 5 past,
2 minutes, 3 seconds!” This comes with terrible

320
00:44:13,950 --> 00:44:20,950
conditioning which has to go away. Not to
react. Why should you react? Then the argument

321
00:44:23,779 --> 00:44:30,779
starts, then fight starts, then wars come
in. If you tell your mind, “Nothing doing,

322
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:39,450
you are a myth and I am not going to react
to anything!” 99. 9% problems will be solved.

323
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:55,490
Then the last, but not the least is the ego.
I can’t understand a saint having a ego,

324
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:06,359
just can’t understand. It’s so stupid
to have ego. It’s a kind of a domination,

325
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:19,520
if slightest things are wrong, you get angry.
If somebody says something, you get angry.

326
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:28,950
That means your power of love and compassion
is still not full. You can of course correct

327
00:45:34,059 --> 00:45:40,289
people when they have to be corrected but
for that you should have this power within

328
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:46,690
yourself. The person should know that you
are correcting that person because you love

329
00:45:46,690 --> 00:45:53,690
that person, not for selfishness, not for
any gain. But this ego is a very big problem

330
00:45:55,380 --> 00:46:02,380
and that comes up by, I should say, not only
ignorance but stupid ideas about yourself.

331
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:16,400
If you think you are something great, already,
then what can you do? Ego makes you very arrogant,

332
00:46:21,349 --> 00:46:28,349
horrible. But if you are humble, really, not
to just to have the humility of a businessman,

333
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:36,020
but if you are humble from within yourself,
from your heart, enjoying your humility, then

334
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:44,049
this ego can run away.

335
00:46:44,049 --> 00:46:49,609
You have to ask yourself “Now what are you
angry for?” Again, I come back to the same

336
00:46:49,609 --> 00:46:56,609
point: introspection. Because you are not
here just to carry on some jobs, but you are

337
00:46:57,339 --> 00:47:04,339
here to become saints. Then this ego should
be made into a great instrument of love and

338
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:18,250
joy. You can, it is not difficult. This one
is what is ego is, reactions to things. You

339
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:29,089
can react to things in a sweet way or you
can react to things in a deadly way. Then

340
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:36,089
the humour comes in. Also you speak as if
there is fragrant flowers which are coming

341
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:53,690
out. Then every action of yours, everything
becomes very gentle and sweet. Have this ego

342
00:47:57,990 --> 00:48:04,990
that will be gentle, will be kind, will be
sweet, will be forgiving, will be loving.

343
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:12,089
Let’s have this ego. Start with this kind
of a ego – the other way round. You’ll

344
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:18,289
be surprised how you can really conquer the
whole world.

345
00:48:18,289 --> 00:48:25,289
On this day of Guru Puja, is, Guru is supposed
to tell something to his disciples about correcting

346
00:48:26,910 --> 00:48:33,369
themselves. In my own sweet way I’ve said
to you which you shouldn’t mind. I don’t

347
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:40,369
mean to condemn you by any chance but to give
you a proper sense of introspection, proper

348
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:47,839
sense of introspection by which you all get
your gurupada. My only, I shouldn’t say

349
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:59,490
desire, because I don’t have desire. So
my only vision is, that I should see all the

350
00:49:00,099 --> 00:49:07,099
Sahaja Yogis drenched in the power of love,
enjoying each others love, enjoying each others

351
00:49:11,539 --> 00:49:18,539
relationship, and improving relationships.
I know there are problematic people, I know

352
00:49:18,670 --> 00:49:24,099
they are problematic, but if you cannot solve
the problem what’s the use of your become

353
00:49:24,099 --> 00:49:26,549
masters?

354
00:49:26,549 --> 00:49:33,549
So, I leave it to you to solve your own problems
which you are facing, and introspection with

355
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:49,789
love and compassion, not by condemning yourself.
I am sure you can manage it.

356
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,420
May God bless you.
