00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:14.207
It’s very nice to see all of you here, so many of you from Australia,

00:00:16.528 --> 00:00:19.152
to worship Shiva, Sadashiva.

00:00:20.941 --> 00:00:24.328
I think this is a very important occasion.

00:00:34.663 --> 00:00:42.028
Is important, because Sadashiva,

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:46.534
the God Almighty, who is One,

00:00:47.861 --> 00:00:53.730
is expressed on your heart as Spirit, the Shiva.

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:09.872
We have to understand that so many people came on this earth at different times,

00:01:09.953 --> 00:01:16.640
in different countries, and they talked to different people

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.873
about righteousness, that is dharma,

00:01:23.357 --> 00:01:27.886
about how to elevate yourself,

00:01:28.725 --> 00:01:34.204
and all of them have said that you have to be reborn,

00:01:34.306 --> 00:01:38.627
that is, you have to become the Spirit.

00:01:39.504 --> 00:01:41.541
They have all

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.577
said the same thing because they knew, without

00:01:57.029 --> 00:02:04.545
the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

00:02:06.001 --> 00:02:11.259
you will not be able to understand spirituality.

00:02:26.483 --> 00:02:30.001
You have the Spirit within you,

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:34.572
which is all the time in a witness state.

00:02:35.246 --> 00:02:38.511
Why all the religions have failed?

00:02:38.592 --> 00:02:44.516
Because they did not get their Self-Realization.

00:02:44.808 --> 00:02:48.932
They did not become the Spirit.

00:02:50.641 --> 00:02:55.559
So there's a tremendous difference between you and all others

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:01.307
who profess something. It looks as if they are hypocrites.

00:03:01.388 --> 00:03:08.391
They intellectualize it as you know, they explain it very well,

00:03:08.472 --> 00:03:16.025
but you can see very clearly that they haven't absorbed spirituality.

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:22.779
That absorption was impossible without Self-Realization.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:30.496
Also, the collectivity you have now is tremendous.

00:03:30.995 --> 00:03:34.529
It's not only in Australia you have the collectivity,

00:03:35.947 --> 00:03:41.182
but the other day I telephoned to someone in India and told them,

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.596
“I'm buying an ashram in Brisbane.”

00:03:43.734 --> 00:03:47.100
They said, “ Mother it's a very great thing. We are very happy.”

00:03:47.268 --> 00:03:48.903
Now for an Indian,

00:03:50.014 --> 00:03:53.948
what is there to be happy if we buy an ashram in Brisbane?

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.206
So overjoyed about it.

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:02.605
To them Brisbane is the same as Bombay or Delhi.

00:04:07.963 --> 00:04:10.511
The Heart has become so large,

00:04:10.999 --> 00:04:14.412
because Shiva is shining there, the Spirit is shining.

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:17.002
It has become such a large Heart

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:22.340
that it encompasses the whole universe, I think, the way people look at it,

00:04:22.454 --> 00:04:26.966
that's why you all have become universal people.

00:04:27.681 --> 00:04:33.887
You don't only read about Vishwa Nirmala Dharma,

00:04:34.245 --> 00:04:39.054
you don't only knowabout it through your mind,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.547
you don't only try to follow it, but you have imbibed it within yourself,

00:04:45.387 --> 00:04:48.720
which is so Sahaj, which you are not aware of it,

00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:51.742
how in a Sahaj way it has come to you.

00:04:51.923 --> 00:04:55.774
But still I would say you must know your self-esteem,

00:04:55.877 --> 00:04:59.877
that you are Sahaja Yogis, and how can you behave like this

00:04:59.981 --> 00:05:05.251
if you are a Sahaja Yogi? You cannot. Now you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:10.659
so that dignity, that wisdom has to be there;

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:19.132
the compassion, the love, the unity of purpose should be there.

00:05:20.866 --> 00:05:24.362
All over the world you have brothers and sisters,

00:05:24.478 --> 00:05:29.024
this brotherhood and sisterhood is everywhere.

00:05:29.274 --> 00:05:33.613
You have rakhi sisters, you have very pure relationships.

00:05:34.532 --> 00:05:38.454
Anything impure is just thrown out in a Sahaj manner.

00:05:39.248 --> 00:05:43.147
Those who do not fit into it just get out of it.

00:05:46.481 --> 00:05:52.022
We have now very beautiful families, very beautiful children,

00:05:52.986 --> 00:05:56.150
it's, just think of it.

00:05:56.250 --> 00:06:06.605
So now, you are the people who have understood what is God,

00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:14.448
what is Sadashiva. Now you have faith in Him which is not blind,

00:06:14.823 --> 00:06:17.678
you also know that His powers work,

00:06:18.007 --> 00:06:22.607
that His laws work, all other laws are useless, only His laws works.

00:06:27.203 --> 00:06:30.567
You have seen, experienced in your lifetime

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:35.191
how miracles are taking place, how things are working out.

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:38.570
A simple miracle I would say, it was desired

00:06:38.718 --> 00:06:42.448
that Shiva Puja should be around some hills,

00:06:43.049 --> 00:06:45.177
but they couldn't arrange,

00:06:45.314 --> 00:06:50.800
they were trying for some other place which could not be arranged, so you are here.

00:06:51.016 --> 00:06:56.730
You desire and it works, as if your desire acts.

00:06:59.292 --> 00:07:03.031
But we have some people who are still mediocre,

00:07:03.201 --> 00:07:05.950
who are behaving in a mediocre manner,

00:07:06.063 --> 00:07:09.129
very dull, some of them are very dull people.

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:11.499
They cannot understand Sahaj,

00:07:11.692 --> 00:07:15.783
they don't understand how much they can gain out of it.

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:19.295
So you shouldn't worry about them.

00:07:20.497 --> 00:07:25.146
Then you have to think about the whole collective which is good

00:07:25.407 --> 00:07:28.740
and one or two useless people, forget about them.

00:07:29.226 --> 00:07:32.171
If they come up well and good, if they don't come up,

00:07:32.296 --> 00:07:34.779
we are not going to force them.

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:40.106
We'll be getting more and more people, more and more people.

00:07:41.195 --> 00:07:44.039
I'm sure it will happen.

00:07:45.036 --> 00:07:49.303
But the greatest thing you have got is the complete integration

00:07:52.362 --> 00:07:57.915
within your being: your heart, your mind,

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:05.611
your liver I should say, your attention, are all integrated.

00:08:06.734 --> 00:08:09.721
There's no quarrel, there's no struggle

00:08:10.541 --> 00:08:17.079
between your heart and your mind, heart and your brain.

00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:22.804
Whatever your brain thinks, your heart accepts,

00:08:23.087 --> 00:08:27.253
whatever your heart wants, your brain accepts,

00:08:27.446 --> 00:08:33.115
whatever your attention is there, is completely integrated

00:08:33.861 --> 00:08:37.580
with your heart and with your brain.

00:08:39.304 --> 00:08:43.504
You must see the other people, they don't want to do something

00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:47.792
but they have to do it because they’re habituated.

00:08:47.953 --> 00:08:51.533
So many people told Me: “We want to give up this, we can't.”

00:08:51.658 --> 00:08:55.396
Once you have got the Spirit, you get that power

00:08:56.202 --> 00:08:59.335
that you can surpass all the said temptations,

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:03.161
not only temptations, also the differentiations

00:09:03.332 --> 00:09:06.254
that you always make: “This is that, this is that.”

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:12.048
But you integrate, you integrate among yourselves,

00:09:12.729 --> 00:09:15.538
you integrate among different states,

00:09:15.663 --> 00:09:18.699
you integrate among different countries.

00:09:20.457 --> 00:09:25.102
The whole cosmos seems to be integrated, woven

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:31.613
and governed by the Divine laws.

00:09:34.198 --> 00:09:41.307
This integration gives you a complete understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:09:44.174 --> 00:09:52.415
mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

00:09:56.892 --> 00:10:01.824
It’s not by some sort of a brain-washing

00:10:02.414 --> 00:10:08.817
or bombarding, but just through the light of Spirit you have seen the truth

00:10:09.917 --> 00:10:14.869
and you have understood it. Also you have so many powers.

00:10:16.003 --> 00:10:20.203
You do not want to exert, that's a different point altogether,

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.170
but just try.

00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:29.515
One word of prayer from you is very powerful

00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:33.427
than hundreds of prayers of these people.

00:10:37.135 --> 00:10:41.896
One asking is much more powerful

00:10:42.857 --> 00:10:45.428
than thousands of these askings.

00:10:45.803 --> 00:10:48.613
You have never tried that; try that,

00:10:49.146 --> 00:10:53.079
you are extremely powerful, whatever you desire works out.

00:10:56.413 --> 00:10:59.937
You have other powers of giving Realization,

00:11:00.255 --> 00:11:02.722
also curing, you have so many powers

00:11:03.317 --> 00:11:06.950
but most of the time you'll bring somebody to Me to be cured.

00:11:07.155 --> 00:11:09.762
No, no, there's no need.

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.213
You have given all powers; you have all the powers, use them.

00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:19.568
Don't be afraid, use these powers, and you will be amazed

00:11:20.124 --> 00:11:22.441
how these power work out,

00:11:23.938 --> 00:11:33.620
and how you become more and more embedded in your faith, in yourself.

00:11:33.867 --> 00:11:40.587
Your faith in Me, I must say, is great. I am Myself surprised at that.

00:11:48.277 --> 00:11:50.292
I am quite a camouflage.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:55.473
It's not easy to understand Me, I don't understand Myself!

00:12:02.887 --> 00:12:07.266
On one side of course I'm Divine, no doubt,

00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:12.048
on the other side, I am very human.

00:12:13.205 --> 00:12:19.053
Even in a film, if I see somebody suffering, I start crying, can't bear.

00:12:19.234 --> 00:12:30.914
And so this human realization, I should, that I had, is so beautiful.

00:12:33.397 --> 00:12:37.072
Now I understand what is the joy of bhakti,

00:12:38.094 --> 00:12:41.458
what is the joy of gnyana,

00:12:42.955 --> 00:12:49.599
what is the joy of karma, because a person who doesn't do anything,

00:12:50.894 --> 00:13:00.060
a person who has no bhakti and who has no gnyana

00:13:04.925 --> 00:13:07.401
is just wakened completely.

00:13:09.783 --> 00:13:12.755
I had to fill in Myself with all these things

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.487
that I have to know the gnyana,

00:13:15.624 --> 00:13:19.351
not the gnyana of the Divine because after all that is,

00:13:19.488 --> 00:13:25.303
that is not difficult, because if I am that, I know that,

00:13:25.837 --> 00:13:28.767
but the gnyana of the human beings,

00:13:30.366 --> 00:13:36.137
the problems of the human beings, I had to study for years

00:13:36.795 --> 00:13:41.724
the human beings to work it out.

00:13:43.266 --> 00:13:45.520
But once it has worked,

00:13:47.561 --> 00:13:52.961
that's what is said that there is Divinity in you has started expressing itself,

00:13:54.148 --> 00:13:58.284
and such beautiful Divine lights are sitting before Me.

00:13:59.679 --> 00:14:05.697
I bless you all from My heart where resides the Shiva, the Sadashiva,

00:14:06.593 --> 00:14:08.722
and Sadashiva blesses you.

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:13.640
He is a innocent personality, absolutely innocent.

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:20.933
He is the One who is beyond any attachments,

00:14:24.947 --> 00:14:27.280
absolutely beyond any attachments.

00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:36.515
He is the One who is watching, watching all of you with such admiration,

00:14:37.706 --> 00:14:47.146
His joy knows no bounds, it's tremendous, as if He is dancing with joy.

00:14:49.539 --> 00:14:56.534
It's a great day for us to celebrate this Shiva Puja here.

00:14:56.920 --> 00:15:01.317
I hope all of you respect the principle of Shiva within you,

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:03.601
that's the most important.

00:15:03.885 --> 00:15:11.889
And look after your vibrations, which pulsates in your being,

00:15:12.207 --> 00:15:17.220
because the Spirit has awakened in your attention,

00:15:17.572 --> 00:15:20.517
in your central nervous system.

00:15:20.699 --> 00:15:23.899
That's the most important thing you have to do.

00:15:23.999 --> 00:15:27.535
The rest of it is Sahaj.

00:15:29.567 --> 00:15:32.276
The rest of it is absolutely Sahaj.

00:15:32.694 --> 00:15:34.794
May God bless you all.
