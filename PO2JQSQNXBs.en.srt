1
00:00:10,709 --> 00:00:16,792
Last time you had asked Me for Gurupada,

2
00:00:17,792 --> 00:00:25,834
and you should know that the essence of Guru

3
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:29,626
is Shri Ganesha, the innocence.

4
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:36,918
You must be knowing the story of a very devoted wife,

5
00:00:37,042 --> 00:00:41,250
faithful wife, of a sati.

6
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:45,667
Her name was Anasuya,

7
00:00:46,042 --> 00:00:52,083
and she was so religious

8
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,834
and so dedicated

9
00:00:56,125 --> 00:01:00,375
that they say that the wives of all the gods,

10
00:01:00,626 --> 00:01:07,250
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha, got very jealous of her.

11
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:14,209
So they told their husbands that "You must go and test her,

12
00:01:14,459 --> 00:01:20,500
if she's really a woman with chastity or not."

13
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:24,751
So all of them came down as sadhus,

14
00:01:24,959 --> 00:01:28,709
dressed up like sanyasis.

15
00:01:29,876 --> 00:01:34,542
And she said she wanted to serve them,

16
00:01:34,834 --> 00:01:37,542
give them something. They said, "No, we want to have food."

17
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,959
She said, "All right, come and sit down."

18
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,417
She cooked food for them.

19
00:01:45,417 --> 00:01:47,755
So they said, "No, we will not have the food

20
00:01:47,836 --> 00:01:51,253
unless and until you take out all your clothes.

21
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:55,334
We'll only have the food if you take out all your clothes."

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,751
She said, "Is it so?" She said, "Yes."

23
00:01:59,042 --> 00:02:03,375
So she made them into little, little children, three little children,

24
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:06,667
and then she became nude,

25
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,709
because innocent doesn't understand anything about it.

26
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:14,125
And then she joined them together,

27
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:18,542
their three innocences were joined together

28
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:27,626
and they got their Gurupada.

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,626
That's how the Adi Guru was created.

30
00:02:33,459 --> 00:02:38,918
So the first thing is that if you want your Gurupad,

31
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,751
you have to be innocent.

32
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:47,083
"Innocent" is a very vague term, very vague,

33
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,959
and difficult to really understand what is innocent.

34
00:02:55,709 --> 00:02:58,626
But what is the nature of innocence?

35
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:04,375
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

36
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:05,417
First of all

37
00:03:05,667 --> 00:03:12,667
He's endowed with wisdom,

38
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,500
and He puts wisdom into us.

39
00:03:20,542 --> 00:03:27,542
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

40
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:35,042
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

41
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:42,167
It is He who puts genetics in us.

42
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:50,125
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

43
00:03:51,125 --> 00:03:54,250
and when He puts wisdom in us,

44
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:59,083
then we are wise.

45
00:04:00,334 --> 00:04:05,626
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

46
00:04:06,792 --> 00:04:10,542
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

47
00:04:10,792 --> 00:04:12,334
They have no wisdom.

48
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:16,042
They do things without wisdom.

49
00:04:16,292 --> 00:04:21,542
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

50
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,902
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,
whatever it is.

51
00:04:25,982 --> 00:04:27,821
You may brand yourself with anything;

52
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,341
but you can see from their behavior they're,

53
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:34,042
that they have no wisdom at all.

54
00:04:36,167 --> 00:04:41,334
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

55
00:04:42,209 --> 00:04:44,375
In some people who are not yet evolved,

56
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:47,417
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

57
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:51,042
this wisdom is lacking.

58
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,209
Apart from that,

59
00:04:54,500 --> 00:05:00,792
this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

60
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:09,209
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

61
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:13,375
all kinds of bad habits.

62
00:05:13,918 --> 00:05:17,834
We don't like to look at nudity.

63
00:05:18,626 --> 00:05:24,334
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

64
00:05:26,167 --> 00:05:31,626
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

65
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:39,125
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

66
00:05:39,834 --> 00:05:45,459
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

67
00:05:45,834 --> 00:05:50,626
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

68
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,375
We are automatically dharmic.

69
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:56,542
We don't kill others,

70
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:58,667
we don't aggress others,

71
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,959
we don't torture others.

72
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:06,417
We do not occupy anybody else's land or house

73
00:06:06,626 --> 00:06:10,292
or take away anything,

74
00:06:11,292 --> 00:06:14,709
another's property or another's things.

75
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:20,125
This wisdom comes to you through Shri Ganesh.

76
00:06:20,626 --> 00:06:27,375
In short, He makes you absolutely ready for Self-Realization.

77
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,751
It is He only ultimately

78
00:06:32,083 --> 00:06:33,834
who looks after us

79
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:38,751
at the time of our nirvana, at the time of our realization,

80
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:42,250
because

81
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:47,417
He stops all other activities of excretion

82
00:06:47,918 --> 00:06:54,834
when you are ascending into new realm.

83
00:06:56,083 --> 00:07:00,042
You have seen, I'm sitting here for nine hours, ten hours.

84
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,876
Once I sat down for eighteen hours together,

85
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,542
didn't go at all, even to bathroom.

86
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:12,209
Because it is He who stops all these activities -

87
00:07:12,459 --> 00:07:16,334
even when kundalini is rising, it stops.

88
00:07:17,292 --> 00:07:20,792
So this wisdom is innate,

89
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:25,209
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

90
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:29,918
He becomes, manifesting in us -

91
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,709
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

92
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:39,417
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

93
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:43,709
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

94
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,626
You become the child,

95
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:49,417
at that time you become a child.

96
00:07:49,751 --> 00:07:51,667
And with the kundalini rising,

97
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:55,375
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

98
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,626
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

99
00:07:58,834 --> 00:08:01,876
He's the power in the kundalini.

100
00:08:02,334 --> 00:08:04,918
He gives wisdom in the brain.

101
00:08:05,209 --> 00:08:10,292
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

102
00:08:10,792 --> 00:08:14,876
all your attachments which are wrong,

103
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:20,876
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

104
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:24,375
He changes, your genetics are changed.

105
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:28,334
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

106
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,876
about the same I would say,

107
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:37,334
and the genetics of other people would be different.

108
00:08:37,792 --> 00:08:40,500
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

109
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:43,834
because Indians normally are very wise people.

110
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,584
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

111
00:08:46,709 --> 00:08:49,792
the superiority of races from wisdom point of view,

112
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,459
Indians are very wise.

113
00:08:51,709 --> 00:08:55,209
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

114
00:08:55,417 --> 00:08:58,667
Even the children I have seen, children from the West

115
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,334
when they go to India: they went for this school,

116
00:09:01,417 --> 00:09:04,292
they are doing all kinds of destructive things to themselves --

117
00:09:04,417 --> 00:09:06,125
nobody could understand.

118
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,918
Once they jumped into a dirty pond.

119
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,542
They got malaria.

120
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:14,834
Then they ran out of the house, of the school

121
00:09:15,167 --> 00:09:19,876
and came out and went to the roads, went to the shops.

122
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,751
So they put a gate.

123
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,918
When they put the gate the newspaper is criticizing us,

124
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:28,125
there's no sense in it, every school has a gate.

125
00:09:28,542 --> 00:09:34,667
So these all unwise, stupid things they do because they lack wisdom.

126
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:37,417
A child who has wisdom is extremely cautious,

127
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:39,709
he understands the importance of his life.

128
00:09:40,042 --> 00:09:42,834
He respects his parents, he respects everything

129
00:09:43,209 --> 00:09:46,542
- automatically, you don't have to tell them.

130
00:09:46,918 --> 00:09:52,417
Automatically they know what is dharma is, 
you don't have to tell them.

131
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:59,209
That wisdom, this great deity of Ganesha,

132
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:03,000
He took His form as Jesus Christ.

133
00:10:03,375 --> 00:10:10,417
And you all accepted Him as the Lord, which is true also.

134
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:16,626
But because your Ganesh Principle was not

135
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,292
so much developed in these Western countries,

136
00:10:20,542 --> 00:10:23,959
people took to stupid things.

137
00:10:24,417 --> 00:10:29,459
This pornography and this kind of a interest in nude women shows

138
00:10:29,667 --> 00:10:34,000
that there is no wisdom in them, there is no Ganesha in them.

139
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:37,417
Though they follow Christ, it's just a lipservice going to the church.

140
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:40,375
I don't know if the church also has any Ganesha in them,

141
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,250
they have no Ganesha.

142
00:10:42,459 --> 00:10:44,667
The way they lead their life, nobody can say

143
00:10:44,876 --> 00:10:48,125
they have any sense of holiness and auspiciousness.

144
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:52,542
As soon as you get wisdom, you understand holiness and auspiciousness.

145
00:10:52,792 --> 00:10:55,209
Before that you just call "holy father",

146
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,500
and holy father is doing all kinds of things

147
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:02,000
which can create holes in the organization;

148
00:11:02,626 --> 00:11:07,876
who takes money, bribes, creates bombs, have women,

149
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:12,667
I mean everything -- how can he be holy?

150
00:11:14,626 --> 00:11:17,250
So this wisdom part is so important,

151
00:11:17,417 --> 00:11:19,626
and that's what we should ask

152
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:22,000
Ganesha, to make us like children.

153
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:27,751
Children have basically wisdom, but not all the children.

154
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,125
This is the thing is,

155
00:11:29,334 --> 00:11:33,250
that children in which Shri Ganesha has activated,

156
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,292
has put this genetic of wisdom, it is there.

157
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:43,792
This is one of the greatest things we have to think about:

158
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:49,083
is it wise, it is sane? It's not to be logically -

159
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:52,292
logically if you believe in something then you can go wrong,

160
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:55,125
because there's no strength from within.

161
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:58,751
But innately if it becomes that, you won't do it at any cost.

162
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:00,667
Now you know yourself,

163
00:12:00,792 --> 00:12:03,209
all the Sahaja yogis are so different:

164
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:05,659
they behave differently, they stand differently,

165
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,292
they talk differently, they think differently, they

166
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:09,918
- everything is different.

167
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:13,792
Suddenly he has become, they have become like that.

168
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,834
And you can't understand, how is it we have become like this?

169
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:22,292
They were drinking, they were smoking, drug-taking,

170
00:12:22,459 --> 00:12:23,626
everything they did.

171
00:12:23,876 --> 00:12:26,500
But how is it suddenly you changed?

172
00:12:26,709 --> 00:12:31,626
Because Shri Ganesha has put this wisdom in you.
