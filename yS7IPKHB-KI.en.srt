1
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:56,609
Today we have all been waiting to celebrate
the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ.

2
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:07,002
There's so much significant that we are
in a place here,

3
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:18,824
the same type of a hut Jesus had when He
was born,

4
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:22,488
and the wind was blowing from all sides

5
00:04:22,689 --> 00:04:31,048
and it was difficult to keep the room very
warm,

6
00:04:31,249 --> 00:04:39,229
though if it is correct He was not born
in the month of December,

7
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:46,464
in a warmer month, not so very cold, maybe
this much as you see;

8
00:04:46,665 --> 00:04:54,384
so maybe that the climate of today is quite
significant, with the climate

9
00:04:55,123 --> 00:04:58,757
that He must have felt.

10
00:05:00,393 --> 00:05:04,129
As for you people, you don't feel any
discomfort in this climate,

11
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:10,337
nor in these surroundings nor in the Spartan
living.

12
00:05:10,617 --> 00:05:15,467
He never felt any discomfort, nor
His Mother.

13
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:20,680
When our attention is on our Spirit,

14
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:33,422
then we do not feel the discomfort of nature
or of worldly things.

15
00:05:33,623 --> 00:05:41,724
This is the first sign when a Sahaja Yogi
starts

16
00:05:43,394 --> 00:05:47,807
complaining about comforts,

17
00:05:48,008 --> 00:05:53,879
then the first sign is that he is not
a Sahaja Yogi as yet.

18
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:04,846
To begin with you just get absolutely
acclimatized with the climate and enjoy

19
00:06:07,799 --> 00:06:15,050
the style, the speed, the way it is molding
you.

20
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:22,682
There's no friction between the nature and
the body because the Spirit

21
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:29,545
which is synchronizer, helps you to become
one

22
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:34,750
with this nature and enjoy the best part
of it.

23
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:39,340
The way you are enjoying it shows that you
are great Sahaja Yogis,

24
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:41,731
and that goes to My credit, I think,

25
00:06:41,932 --> 00:06:49,791
that you people have accepted all
the discomfort as enjoyments.

26
00:06:51,917 --> 00:06:55,890
Christ coming was a great event as I have
told you

27
00:06:56,091 --> 00:07:04,963
to establish Agnya Chakra. And He was born
on this Earth

28
00:07:05,164 --> 00:07:09,654
but much before He was born
in the consciousness

29
00:07:09,855 --> 00:07:18,667
and that absolute consciousness itself took
birth as Jesus Christ.

30
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:23,573
To explain His life is only possible if you
are Realized souls,

31
00:07:23,774 --> 00:07:29,571
otherwise you cannot explain Christ - what
He was, how He worked -

32
00:07:29,772 --> 00:07:36,175
still it's very difficult to explain many
things in Sahaja Yoga as you know,

33
00:07:36,376 --> 00:07:42,147
you just go on seeing things. Today you
saw fountains

34
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:45,940
coming out of the lake, which nobody can
explain,

35
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:50,602
even the engineer said that they can't
explain, nobody can explain it.

36
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:56,342
It just happens that the water gets
excited, feels the Divinity

37
00:07:56,543 --> 00:08:02,041
and starts pouring out its love in a bubbly
manner.

38
00:08:02,242 --> 00:08:05,646
Can you imagine that even the water can
feel it?

39
00:08:05,847 --> 00:08:12,481
You have seen how the light can feel it,
in the same way every element can feel it.

40
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:16,758
All those elements are within us,
the highest of all,

41
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:23,125
as we say, is the light,

42
00:08:24,097 --> 00:08:31,038
because light has an effect and that is
governed by Jesus Christ.

43
00:08:31,239 --> 00:08:38,830
Light has an effect, light shows things
that are correct.

44
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:47,106
That's the one which makes us understand
all the dimensions of worldly things

45
00:08:47,307 --> 00:08:55,749
and ultimately when this light comes from
the Spirit and is enlightened by the Spirit,

46
00:08:55,950 --> 00:09:02,478
then you start seeing the other dimensions
also which sometimes make you laugh,

47
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:08,995
sometimes make you smile and sometimes
make you cry also.

48
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:16,054
Such a beautiful new dimension you have
achieved through Sahaja Yoga,

49
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:20,930
but it was all built in within you and you
had to achieve it.

50
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:26,185
People on the other side had to work very
hard,

51
00:09:26,386 --> 00:09:33,330
like Jesus Christ was born in a small manger
to show

52
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:38,000
that Divinity need not be born in royal
families,

53
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:42,130
can be born in a manger,

54
00:09:42,351 --> 00:09:46,754
can be born anywhere, makes no difference
to the Divinity.

55
00:09:46,955 --> 00:09:55,166
But that has given some funny ideas
to people, that they are saying

56
00:09:55,367 --> 00:10:02,395
we should make ourselves miserable

57
00:10:02,596 --> 00:10:09,403
and we should give away everything to God.
God doesn't want anything.

58
00:10:09,604 --> 00:10:14,190
He cannot have anything, and you cannot
give anything.

59
00:10:14,391 --> 00:10:18,991
Is a wrong idea that you become like
a pauper and give everything to God.

60
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:27,617
He doesn't want that. What He wants that
you have to be happy, joyous and enjoying.

61
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:29,830
That's the main point.

62
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:35,760
Also if you give a little bit, very little
bit to God,

63
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:38,763
then He gives you hundred times more.

64
00:10:38,964 --> 00:10:42,927
That's why you have to give a very wee bit
to God.

65
00:10:43,128 --> 00:10:46,580
But you don't have to hang yourself
by the trees

66
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:50,609
to prove that you want to sacrifice.

67
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:54,950
Christ has done everything for you. That's
the beauty of His life is

68
00:10:55,151 --> 00:11:00,734
that from the very beginning of His birth
He has shown that He has enjoyed

69
00:11:00,935 --> 00:11:08,464
no material well-being, as we call it.

70
00:11:08,665 --> 00:11:17,858
He has not enjoyed any worldly things as we
know of

71
00:11:20,072 --> 00:11:24,945
but that just means that He has done that
for us to see

72
00:11:25,146 --> 00:11:30,630
that there is no need for us to hanker
after worldly things -

73
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:35,151
they will hanker after us. You don't have
to worry about these things.

74
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:39,947
What you have to worry is the Spirit,
the main thing.

75
00:11:41,219 --> 00:11:49,075
All His life, which was very short I should
say, He has been trying,

76
00:11:49,276 --> 00:11:56,856
He was very much interested in evaluating
people

77
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,320
because He didn't know what sort of things
these human beings are.

78
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:08,893
He was a foreigner for these human beings.
So He tried to evaluate

79
00:12:09,094 --> 00:12:12,324
and in that evaluation

80
00:12:12,911 --> 00:12:20,412
He said many things which are very
remarkable, and one has to understand.

81
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:27,182
One of the things He said that don't throw
your pearls before people

82
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:34,380
who do not want to understand you. For
Sahaja Yogis it is important to understand

83
00:12:34,581 --> 00:12:39,727
that you should not talk about Sahaja Yoga
to people who are anti-God.

84
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:42,795
Now he may be your brother, may be your
sister, may be your father,

85
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:48,236
may be anyone, there is no need to convince
them about Sahaja Yoga

86
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:52,763
because they are not your relations.

87
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:56,413
Many people have only this worry how
to convince my husband

88
00:12:56,614 --> 00:13:03,368
or how to convince my brother, there is
no need at all for you to work it out,

89
00:13:05,912 --> 00:13:09,881
just give them up on this point.

90
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:15,050
The another thing He has told us which is
very important, I think,

91
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:18,582
that we must forgive.

92
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:23,946
He has given the greatest weapon that we
must forgive.

93
00:13:24,306 --> 00:13:28,039
Now it's such a practical thing to forgive.

94
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,600
If you just forgive, the person doesn't
exist anymore

95
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:38,236
and the person doesn't trouble you anymore,
nor is he in your attention,

96
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:44,778
just to forgive is a simplest thing to do
and the highest thing to do

97
00:13:44,952 --> 00:13:53,946
to get relief from worldly or mental
tortures that we get.

98
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:03,992
His life has been a story of spirituality,

99
00:14:04,193 --> 00:14:09,622
going through all kinds of turmoils and
tortures,

100
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:14,866
all types of troubles that the Spirit can
go through,

101
00:14:15,035 --> 00:14:21,200
to show that nobody can kill that Spirit,

102
00:14:21,401 --> 00:14:27,609
as it’s said in the Gita: "Nainam chidanti
shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

103
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:31,781
na chainam kledayantya apo, na shosayati
marutah".

104
00:14:31,982 --> 00:14:34,641
It cannot be killed, it's an eternal life

105
00:14:34,842 --> 00:14:38,146
and He tried to prove through His life
the eternity,

106
00:14:38,347 --> 00:14:44,579
from the beginning to the end He showed
that Spirit is above matter,

107
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,943
that nothing can dominate Spirit.

108
00:14:49,144 --> 00:14:53,248
It's a very big thing He has done for us is
to create

109
00:14:53,449 --> 00:15:02,234
such a big confidence in our Spirit.

110
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,689
He has proved it beyond doubt.

111
00:15:05,890 --> 00:15:11,002
I hope you people will understand and will
not bother Me or bother yourself

112
00:15:11,203 --> 00:15:16,709
with small petty things here and there,
is nothing important.

113
00:15:17,529 --> 00:15:27,544
Ask for bigger things, eternal things,
valuable things.

114
00:15:29,618 --> 00:15:32,142
Also I am very happy that you like this
place

115
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:34,289
and you are enjoying yourself here very
much

116
00:15:34,490 --> 00:15:37,241
and today we have declared so many
marriages.

117
00:15:37,442 --> 00:15:40,352
There have been so many events in this
short time.

118
00:15:40,553 --> 00:15:44,428
So I would like to bless you all for this
Christmas Eve

119
00:15:44,629 --> 00:15:48,006
and I wish you all very happy Christmas and
Happy New Year.
