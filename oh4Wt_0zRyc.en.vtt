00:03:59.062 --> 00:04:10.042
Today, we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

00:04:10.042 --> 00:04:16.172
See how cold it was about three o'clock.

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:27.162
Now the reason is this, that Shri Krishna
did little mischief with Indra.

00:04:27.162 --> 00:04:37.121
Indra, who is a God, or you can call semi-God,
for looking after the rain.

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:42.602
So, Indra got very angry.

00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:55.011
You see all such semi-Gods are very sensitive
people, at the smallest thing they get angry

00:04:55.011 --> 00:05:05.052
and irritated and they start using their powers
to express their anger.

00:05:05.052 --> 00:05:17.172
So he started pouring rain on all the gopas
and Shri Krishna, who were looking after the

00:05:17.172 --> 00:05:24.882
cows.

00:05:24.882 --> 00:05:35.632
And the rain was so heavy that they thought
that the whole land will be completely submerged.

00:05:35.632 --> 00:06:07.202
So Indra was very happy to spoil the game
of Shri Krishna, and he thought he was very

00:06:07.202 --> 00:06:09.132
successful.

00:06:09.132 --> 00:06:27.132
So, Shri Krishna lifted a mountain on His
finger, and all these people who were getting

00:06:27.132 --> 00:06:30.612
drowned, went under that mountain.

00:06:30.612 --> 00:06:38.492
This is Shri Krishna's style.

00:06:38.492 --> 00:06:43.352
My style is different.

00:06:43.352 --> 00:06:49.922
I told Indra that you can't misbehave with
me, you can't.

00:06:49.922 --> 00:06:59.722
So far I'm not harmed you in any way and
I'm not irritated you.

00:06:59.722 --> 00:07:08.962
Of course it's going to be Shri Krishna's
Puja, but that doesn't mean that you should

00:07:08.962 --> 00:07:15.142
try to show off your powers before me.

00:07:15.142 --> 00:07:23.342
Sometimes I wonder these Devas - Semi-Gods,
they are realized souls or not, because why

00:07:23.342 --> 00:07:29.342
do they get angry like this for small things.

00:07:29.342 --> 00:07:40.182
Whatever it is, he could be reconciled and
now it's become warm, I must say.

00:07:40.182 --> 00:07:56.802
With Sahaja Yoga you can do many many things,
but you must know what you can do.

00:07:56.802 --> 00:08:10.602
For that, Krishna is a very good example.

00:08:10.602 --> 00:08:13.001
He started Sahaj culture.

00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:25.252
Culture, I'm saying - He didn't give realization
to anyone, but He gave the idea of Sahaj culture.

00:08:25.252 --> 00:08:27.342
How?

00:08:27.342 --> 00:08:42.202
- Before him came Shri Ram, who was Maryada
Purushotama, who was a man very particular

00:08:42.202 --> 00:08:45.282
about everything.

00:08:45.282 --> 00:08:55.122
I mean, like He threw out His wife because
He was a king and a king cannot have a scandal,

00:08:55.122 --> 00:08:57.931
especially from His wife.

00:08:57.931 --> 00:09:05.312
So He threw Her out - it was not Kali Yuga,
that's why.

00:09:05.312 --> 00:09:18.662
And His father ordered him to go, not only
His father so much as His stepmother, to go

00:09:18.662 --> 00:09:23.321
in an exile into a forest.

00:09:23.321 --> 00:09:31.652
So He agreed, after all He was Maryada Purushotama.

00:09:31.652 --> 00:09:40.132
So whatever His father said, He agreed, whatever
His mother said, He agreed, and went into

00:09:40.132 --> 00:09:46.352
the forest, stayed there fourteen years.

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:51.322
This is the obedience to the father.

00:09:51.322 --> 00:09:55.601
There was no need, His father was not God.

00:09:55.601 --> 00:10:10.601
He was God, but in those days it was important
to make people, not only respect the parents

00:10:10.601 --> 00:10:18.991
but also to obey them, that was the time.

00:10:18.991 --> 00:10:31.132
In His time there were many munis, and many
saints and many also hatha yogis.

00:10:31.132 --> 00:10:43.861
And these, even before him, used to make people
practice very strict type of discipline and

00:10:43.861 --> 00:10:54.421
if they did not practice the discipline, they
had to do a lot of penance.

00:10:54.421 --> 00:11:03.301
And, so many people who tried also, never
reached the goal, because of the strictness

00:11:03.301 --> 00:11:19.592
and complete discipline about following the
path of spirituality.

00:11:19.592 --> 00:11:23.652
Recently I was reading a book called "Peaceful
Warrior".

00:11:23.652 --> 00:11:33.252
There they have described an American seeking
the truth, and the guru of that fellow really

00:11:33.252 --> 00:11:41.931
really takes him to such a horrible severe
task - that my granddaughter said, I am very

00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:46.301
angry with such a Guru, she couldn't bear
it.

00:11:46.301 --> 00:11:54.692
So ultimately he finds that he is the existence.

00:11:54.692 --> 00:12:00.942
So that was the practice followed after Shri
Rama.

00:12:00.942 --> 00:12:11.532
People would leave their wives, children,
go to Himalayas and sit there and practice

00:12:11.532 --> 00:12:14.502
meditation.

00:12:14.502 --> 00:12:31.492
It was a very rigorously followed, or I should
say, a very moral society - so very moral.

00:12:31.492 --> 00:12:43.142
But it was out of fear, the whole morality
came through fear, which is also repeated

00:12:43.142 --> 00:12:44.142
in other religions.

00:12:44.142 --> 00:12:50.892
Now I would say that Islam today, has taken
that form, it is the fear.

00:12:50.892 --> 00:12:57.102
They are not doing it out of freedom.

00:12:57.102 --> 00:13:05.622
Also Christians, same thing, and Hindus - I
don't know - halfway this side, and half way

00:13:05.622 --> 00:13:12.092
that side.

00:13:12.092 --> 00:13:18.352
Even among Sikhs there's terrible disciplining.

00:13:18.352 --> 00:13:25.422
So much so that, as punishment you have to
clean the shoes of all the people.

00:13:25.422 --> 00:13:29.172
I don't know if it is to beat yourself with
shoes or another.

00:13:29.172 --> 00:13:35.982
But quite a lot of punishment is there.

00:13:35.982 --> 00:13:50.052
Then came Shri Krishna and He saw the situation
- that the way people are really now fasting.

00:13:50.052 --> 00:14:02.232
If you really go through the rituals of Hindu
religion, out of one week, you will be fasting

00:14:02.232 --> 00:14:05.282
for six days at least.

00:14:05.282 --> 00:14:14.042
One day you might eat some sort of a food,
then you'll have to visit all kinds of places.

00:14:14.042 --> 00:14:24.052
Now, recently they had to go, as you know,
to Amarnath, and so many died there.

00:14:24.052 --> 00:14:32.252
So now they said "we have got Nirvana, we
died while doing this, so we have got Nirvana".

00:14:32.252 --> 00:14:39.182
This kind of a very funny idea was existing.

00:14:39.182 --> 00:14:47.702
That we have Nirvana now, we have achieved
whatever we wanted and now we are dead, so

00:14:47.702 --> 00:14:52.562
many are dead, so those who were not dead
were repenting why they were not dead - it

00:14:52.562 --> 00:14:58.392
would have been much better, they would have
got their Nirvana.

00:14:58.392 --> 00:15:09.712
So, even in this Kali Yuga these ideas are
prevalent.

00:15:09.712 --> 00:15:18.612
Even in India, people have very severe types,
especially in south I have seen, they do all

00:15:18.612 --> 00:15:29.022
kinds of nonsense for the atonement or maybe
for something they are asking.

00:15:29.022 --> 00:15:34.892
All this nonsense was too much for Shri Krishna.

00:15:34.892 --> 00:15:42.142
He couldn't understand that they are going
to destroy their lives with this kind of ritualistic

00:15:42.142 --> 00:15:49.022
gruelling, then what will remain out of them
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:49.022 --> 00:15:51.772
So He's the one who started Sahaj culture.

00:15:51.772 --> 00:16:07.322
He said "let us enjoy, we must have enjoyment,
Nirmala Anand - pure joy".

00:16:07.322 --> 00:16:12.132
How do we have pure joy by?

00:16:12.132 --> 00:16:23.012
- He had this rakhi bandhan by which, apart
from your wife, everybody is your sister or

00:16:23.012 --> 00:16:24.012
mother.

00:16:24.012 --> 00:16:27.112
I must say it is quite true about Indians.

00:16:27.112 --> 00:16:32.882
Not in the north so much because of Islamic
influence, but in the south it is so.

00:16:32.882 --> 00:16:37.062
In Maharastra it is so.

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:48.642
And then He started also this Holi, in which
you should play with colors, maybe to get

00:16:48.642 --> 00:16:52.102
rid of the color barriers we have, maybe.

00:16:52.102 --> 00:16:59.432
In America it is a very good idea to play
with colors and put some black on the whites

00:16:59.432 --> 00:17:06.632
and some whites on the black and they can
see for themselves how stupid it is to fight

00:17:06.632 --> 00:17:14.532
in the name of color.

00:17:14.532 --> 00:17:26.172
He used to play with children who were looking
after cows, just like a very ordinary person.

00:17:26.172 --> 00:17:30.712
He never tried to show off His powers.

00:17:30.712 --> 00:17:40.712
He never tried to stand out, never would dress
up in a very special way, never.

00:17:40.712 --> 00:17:46.532
Just like an out ordinary cowherd.

00:17:46.532 --> 00:17:53.922
And His relationship with His mother, Yeshoda
- she was not His mother - was also extremely

00:17:53.922 --> 00:17:55.852
beautiful.

00:17:55.852 --> 00:18:05.482
There are so many beautiful poems written
about His childhood.

00:18:05.482 --> 00:18:13.062
That, He's the one who is in charge of the
whole universe.

00:18:13.062 --> 00:18:23.352
As a little boy used to put His finger into
His mouth wondering - how can a Divine Virata

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:32.262
do that?

00:18:32.262 --> 00:18:34.612
What is His thinking like a child?

00:18:34.612 --> 00:18:36.732
All His actions of children.

00:18:36.732 --> 00:18:40.552
Yesterday's song, as you heard it, is this.

00:18:40.552 --> 00:18:45.012
All these little, little actions are described
very well.

00:18:45.012 --> 00:18:49.582
Especially by another very great poet, Surdas,
who was blind.

00:18:49.582 --> 00:18:59.102
His childhood is described in a very beautiful
manner and the description of His relationship

00:18:59.102 --> 00:19:05.972
with His mother is very natural and very sweet.

00:19:05.972 --> 00:19:11.052
It was not like this, as modern times, a carpet
is spoiled, "Oh, the carpet you have spoiled

00:19:11.052 --> 00:19:15.672
it, I'll hit you hard, this carpet you have
spoiled".

00:19:15.672 --> 00:19:22.742
They have more interest in their things than
in their own children.

00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:30.542
But according to our culture, if the child
breaks anything, you have to say this "very

00:19:30.542 --> 00:19:33.602
good you have broken, some badha has gone
away".

00:19:33.602 --> 00:19:43.142
Never to scold a child for doing anything
which you think is destructive - because then

00:19:43.142 --> 00:19:47.612
he will definitely become destructive.

00:19:47.612 --> 00:19:52.852
So to understand a child, I think you must
read those poems, beautiful poems, which are

00:19:52.852 --> 00:19:56.882
written about Shri Krishna.

00:19:56.882 --> 00:20:07.952
I don't know how their imagination reached
that beautiful height of pure joy.

00:20:07.952 --> 00:20:19.702
So towards our children also, we have to be
extremely sweet and nice and forgiving.

00:20:19.702 --> 00:20:27.132
But some children, of course, I meet are difficult,
but they also can be corrected if you really

00:20:27.132 --> 00:20:30.532
apply Shri Krishna's methods to him.

00:20:30.532 --> 00:20:43.232
Now when He went to college, or we can say
in to the school of a Sandipanimuni, the guru.

00:20:43.232 --> 00:20:48.662
The guru's wife was very kind.

00:20:48.662 --> 00:20:53.422
But the guru was strict.

00:20:53.422 --> 00:21:03.762
And his wife used to look after him and when
she gave him something for food when they

00:21:03.762 --> 00:21:10.922
would go and bring some woods from the forest.

00:21:10.922 --> 00:21:16.132
It is very subtle, you know the whole thing
is.

00:21:16.132 --> 00:21:24.412
He went there and His friend was carrying
the food.

00:21:24.412 --> 00:21:31.612
His friend was carrying the food and Shri
Krishna was busy cutting the wood, imagine?

00:21:31.612 --> 00:21:39.202
Shri Krishna was cutting the wood for the
mother.

00:21:39.202 --> 00:21:45.442
I mean, for the mother He could do anything,
He was God.

00:21:45.442 --> 00:21:55.482
So no work for the mother was menial or lower.

00:21:55.482 --> 00:22:07.172
But the other fellow, the friend of His, he
was very hungry, so he ate all the food and

00:22:07.172 --> 00:22:09.902
nothing was left.

00:22:09.902 --> 00:22:15.222
So when he came down, he got very much worried.

00:22:15.222 --> 00:22:23.252
He went and told his guru that "I ate all
the food and I didn't share it with Shri Krishna".

00:22:23.252 --> 00:22:34.122
The guru got very angry, very angry and he
said "now, you will be cursed with permanent

00:22:34.122 --> 00:22:35.122
poverty".

00:22:35.122 --> 00:22:47.292
But the mother said "no, not permanent - till
you meet Shri Krishna again".

00:22:47.292 --> 00:22:55.422
That's how she tried to give, we call it Upashad,
in that you give another curse, which can

00:22:55.422 --> 00:22:59.412
neutralize partly.

00:22:59.412 --> 00:23:09.182
The same friend, was Sudama, and he was very
very poor.

00:23:09.182 --> 00:23:19.252
Now see the Sahaj ways of Shri Krishna, He
always used to remember Sudama and He told

00:23:19.252 --> 00:23:26.752
His wife that I really I don't know, he's
cursed, I don't know what must be his condition,

00:23:26.752 --> 00:23:28.192
where he must be?

00:23:28.192 --> 00:23:38.432
Now the friendship - He was a king, such intimacy
of feeling with a friend.

00:23:38.432 --> 00:23:41.912
He said "I used to go with him, I used to
collect the woods.

00:23:41.912 --> 00:23:47.792
I mean, imagine all these little, little things
had such a big importance for him.

00:23:47.792 --> 00:23:54.882
So, He was not only worried about the whole
world, as He should have been, but also about

00:23:54.882 --> 00:23:58.182
Sudama - When will I meet him?

00:23:58.182 --> 00:24:01.112
When will I see him again?

00:24:01.112 --> 00:24:05.971
Where must be his house?

00:24:05.971 --> 00:24:07.492
How he must be living?

00:24:07.492 --> 00:24:17.562
All these very delicate feelings He had for
His friend.

00:24:17.562 --> 00:24:22.872
Just like a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:22.872 --> 00:24:33.282
In the Sahaja style, we worry about the whole
world and also individually we are worried.

00:24:33.282 --> 00:24:45.112
We come to know about one person who has fallen
sick, who has a problem, something is serious.

00:24:45.112 --> 00:24:57.382
All the Sahaja Yogis think of him and are
worried about him, they may have everything,

00:24:57.382 --> 00:25:03.382
but still they are worried, what is happening
to such and such person.

00:25:03.382 --> 00:25:14.192
How many of us know each other's names - I
mean He knows everybody's name - practically.

00:25:14.192 --> 00:25:27.092
And how we care for them, how we respect them,
how we love them and how we have pure relationships.

00:25:27.092 --> 00:25:36.122
Today is also the day of Rakshabandhan, which
is a very great thing that we should have

00:25:36.122 --> 00:25:39.632
pure relationships.

00:25:39.632 --> 00:25:51.202
I've seen in, say Maharashtra, men won't go
and talk to women much and women won't go

00:25:51.202 --> 00:25:55.212
and talk to men.

00:25:55.212 --> 00:26:05.132
And once, somebody remarked - "Then what are
you women doing, talking to women only?".

00:26:05.132 --> 00:26:08.302
So, I said what are we to talk to you?

00:26:08.302 --> 00:26:13.212
You are talking about your office, we are
talking about our houses and homes.

00:26:13.212 --> 00:26:17.232
What is there to talk to you?

00:26:17.232 --> 00:26:23.252
The western culture is different, they will
force you.

00:26:23.252 --> 00:26:28.002
They'll make one man sit here and next to
him should be a woman, somebody else's wife,

00:26:28.002 --> 00:26:31.022
then another man and then somebody else's
wife.

00:26:31.022 --> 00:26:37.972
How can you have intimacy?

00:26:37.972 --> 00:26:49.012
This kind of idea, which is A-Sahaj, has slipped
into immorality.

00:26:49.012 --> 00:26:55.022
There's no need for men and women to sit like
that, what is the need, I just don't understand.

00:26:55.022 --> 00:26:57.582
Compulsorily you have to sit.

00:26:57.582 --> 00:27:09.382
I've had a bad time, I tell you, with my husband's
job, I never liked it.

00:27:09.382 --> 00:27:14.212
What is there to talk to these men, after
all, I don't know anything about banking,

00:27:14.212 --> 00:27:19.422
I don't know shares, I don't know stock exchange,
what it is.

00:27:19.422 --> 00:27:25.292
Or I don't know profits, and this and that
- that part is zero.

00:27:25.292 --> 00:27:33.402
Then, I don't know about office, I don't know
many other things men talk about, so what

00:27:33.402 --> 00:27:39.351
is there to talk to them - it is so very difficult.

00:27:39.351 --> 00:27:46.662
And whenever I said something, I really dropped
a brick.

00:27:46.662 --> 00:27:55.642
Once in a party, they were offering drinks
to everyone and this, so I said "I will have

00:27:55.642 --> 00:27:59.842
a soft drink".

00:27:59.842 --> 00:28:02.452
So the valet came and gave me a soft drink.

00:28:02.452 --> 00:28:11.552
The valet was having a bow, and a white shirt,
that's all, absolutely A-Sahaj methods.

00:28:11.552 --> 00:28:21.422
Black bow, white shirt, black coat, black
pant, all just the same - whether it is an

00:28:21.422 --> 00:28:24.182
ambassador or a valet.

00:28:24.182 --> 00:28:27.152
You can't make it out who is who.

00:28:27.152 --> 00:28:50.432
So I drank, you know, and when it was finished
I gave it to an ambassador, a very well known

00:28:50.432 --> 00:28:51.432
ambassador.

00:28:51.432 --> 00:28:56.622
To me there was no difference at all, when
they are just say walking the same way, talking

00:28:56.622 --> 00:28:59.452
the same way.

00:28:59.452 --> 00:29:05.332
So A-Sahaj the whole thing is.

00:29:05.332 --> 00:29:13.762
They say they have so many Embassies, for
what I don't know and there what they have,

00:29:13.762 --> 00:29:18.272
always drinks, parties - shake hands, shake
hands.

00:29:18.272 --> 00:29:23.272
Your hands will break, I tell you.

00:29:23.272 --> 00:29:26.542
Most A-Sahaj method is to shake hands.

00:29:26.542 --> 00:29:32.662
Why not say Namaste, it is better, and you
know me.

00:29:32.662 --> 00:29:36.382
Sometimes I used to get such heat.

00:29:36.382 --> 00:29:41.052
Like yesterday you have shown that the ice
melted.

00:29:41.052 --> 00:29:44.912
The same thing used to happen to me.

00:29:44.912 --> 00:29:50.112
Mostly they were very hot people and I didn't
know what to do, I used to stand on one side

00:29:50.112 --> 00:29:52.252
just feeling shy.

00:29:52.252 --> 00:29:58.352
But this method of hand shaking is absolutely
A-Sahaj.

00:29:58.352 --> 00:30:08.792
And worse than that is French method, is to
kiss, and like it or not - you are kissed.

00:30:08.792 --> 00:30:10.992
Or to hug somebody.

00:30:10.992 --> 00:30:23.552
The first time I gave realization to one English
gentleman, he just lifted me up like that.

00:30:23.552 --> 00:30:37.172
I said " all right - it's just out of joy
he has done it, it's all right".

00:30:37.172 --> 00:30:43.612
But there is no openness, there's no openness
of heart.

00:30:43.612 --> 00:30:49.582
You go to a party, you have to be dressed
up like this only, if you are not dressed

00:30:49.582 --> 00:30:52.862
up like that, then you are useless.

00:30:52.862 --> 00:30:56.962
If you go for a death also.

00:30:56.962 --> 00:31:01.652
Somebody died, a great friend, a nice man.

00:31:01.652 --> 00:31:04.662
So I was told I had to wear a black sari.

00:31:04.662 --> 00:31:09.912
Black blouse, everything black.

00:31:09.912 --> 00:31:15.162
I said, "I have no sari, black without border,
you know".

00:31:15.162 --> 00:31:18.851
So they said "you don't go".

00:31:18.851 --> 00:31:22.312
I said "Very good idea".

00:31:22.312 --> 00:31:25.922
Because I don't know these A-Sahaj methods.

00:31:25.922 --> 00:31:34.452
You are not supposed to cry or weep there,
no, you have to keep quiet.

00:31:34.452 --> 00:31:43.502
Then when you go there, the body is lying
there, and after a prayer is said, you are

00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:45.882
supposed to drink champagne.

00:31:45.882 --> 00:31:56.322
I mean, imagine it, how can you, no feelings,
for that body which is lying there dead.

00:31:56.322 --> 00:32:03.032
And everybody very happy, and if somebody
looked unhappy, they would ask "what's wrong,

00:32:03.032 --> 00:32:05.902
are you all right?".

00:32:05.902 --> 00:32:09.292
No consciousness that we have lost a friend
here.

00:32:09.292 --> 00:32:16.832
This is the A-Sahaj style when it comes to
grief.

00:32:16.832 --> 00:32:32.412
When it comes to joy it is A-Sahaj, when it
comes to grief it is A-Sahaj.

00:32:32.412 --> 00:32:43.912
We have to be Sahaj, in the sense that whatever
we do, we do it spontaneously.

00:32:43.912 --> 00:32:46.262
Not with deliberations.

00:32:46.262 --> 00:32:51.212
We have some very anglicized people in India
also.

00:32:51.212 --> 00:33:02.851
And the lady of the house died
and I went to see - and in India the body

00:33:02.851 --> 00:33:07.492
is taken down on the ground.

00:33:07.492 --> 00:33:14.412
So they were discussing what to do, what time
to start the funeral and all that.

00:33:14.412 --> 00:33:20.872
So one lady, who is a very well known person
in India, she said "you should not do it before

00:33:20.872 --> 00:33:22.642
twelve o'clock".

00:33:22.642 --> 00:33:23.882
I said "why"?

00:33:23.882 --> 00:33:26.112
She said, "Because I'll have to wear white".

00:33:26.112 --> 00:33:27.822
"That's true".

00:33:27.822 --> 00:33:34.102
"And I'll have to go to the bank to get my
diamonds to match with the white sari".

00:33:34.102 --> 00:33:39.332
I said "What is this?"

00:33:39.332 --> 00:33:50.012
Such filth of materialism.

00:33:50.012 --> 00:34:00.851
It is going too far, we are going away from
our feelings, from our emotions, which are

00:34:00.851 --> 00:34:09.782
genuine, which are there all the time, you
don't have to think about them, they exist

00:34:09.782 --> 00:34:12.882
all the time.

00:34:12.882 --> 00:34:18.142
But you think "Now, should I cry or not?

00:34:18.142 --> 00:34:21.612
Should I laugh or not?

00:34:21.612 --> 00:34:25.642
It's so spontaneous.

00:34:25.642 --> 00:34:30.942
If you have joy, you are spontaneous.

00:34:30.942 --> 00:34:36.632
You express your joy spontaneously.

00:34:36.632 --> 00:34:47.582
Of course, not in an uncultured way, but in
a very cultured way.

00:34:47.582 --> 00:34:55.882
Now, what 's the meaning of the Sahaj culture
- this culture, is something that is, you

00:34:55.882 --> 00:35:07.282
are groomed, you are brought up, in a very
natural manner, that you develop a culture.

00:35:07.282 --> 00:35:20.532
A small, like, a child like, simple innocent
behavior.

00:35:20.532 --> 00:35:39.372
It is Shri Krishna's introduction of idea
of pure joy - Nirmala Anand, which came as

00:35:39.372 --> 00:35:50.402
a great relief to Indian people because they
were following Shri Ramachandra.

00:35:50.402 --> 00:35:55.162
But then abandonment started.

00:35:55.162 --> 00:36:08.652
The problem is, if you make them strict, they
become like starched clothes I think, that

00:36:08.652 --> 00:36:14.142
you can't wear them.

00:36:14.142 --> 00:36:19.522
Or if you allow them - no, no, you must enjoy,
you must enjoy, all right, you allow them,

00:36:19.522 --> 00:36:23.862
do what you like.

00:36:23.862 --> 00:36:29.971
If you allow them to do what you like, then
they start doing all kinds of things.

00:36:29.971 --> 00:36:37.632
In India, we had lots of horrible things,
which I dare not even tell you - in the name

00:36:37.632 --> 00:36:38.632
of enjoyment.

00:36:38.632 --> 00:36:48.942
But Shri Krishna Himself has been very much
misrepresented by stupid people like Vidyapati.

00:36:48.942 --> 00:36:56.591
He was a great poet and he used Krishna and
Radha as Romeo and Juliet.

00:36:56.591 --> 00:37:04.872
That's the greatest insult to the purity of
their relationship.

00:37:04.872 --> 00:37:10.851
You must have seen many pictures like that,
in Kangra Shaili, and this shaili, and that

00:37:10.851 --> 00:37:11.851
shaili.

00:37:11.851 --> 00:37:18.922
It's all nonsense.

00:37:18.922 --> 00:37:34.282
They could not show the reality of their relationship,
but some sort of a very vulgar expression.

00:37:34.282 --> 00:37:42.872
Because I think these poets and these artists
at that time had some hidden suppressed feelings

00:37:42.872 --> 00:37:52.742
within themselves and they used Shri Krishna
for that.

00:37:52.742 --> 00:37:58.482
All kinds of romanticism is attached.

00:37:58.482 --> 00:38:03.862
Sometimes I feel that people have not understood
Shri Krishna.

00:38:03.862 --> 00:38:09.742
But there's a nice story about Him.

00:38:09.742 --> 00:38:22.471
That once, His wives, He had many wives, that
is also another controversial point.

00:38:22.471 --> 00:38:32.572
He had many wives, because these were sixteen
thousand powers of Shri Krishna, who had taken

00:38:32.572 --> 00:38:41.352
birth and were captured by one king and kept
in the prison.

00:38:41.352 --> 00:38:47.812
So He had to release them, they were released.

00:38:47.812 --> 00:38:55.472
Now how are they to live with Shri Krishna,
He was a young man - so He married all of

00:38:55.472 --> 00:38:57.532
them.

00:38:57.532 --> 00:39:01.602
That is the case of Mohammed Sahib also.

00:39:01.602 --> 00:39:07.522
He married all sixteen of them, they were
his powers.

00:39:07.522 --> 00:39:16.252
For a young man to keep sixteen thousand women
like a harem, what people would have thought

00:39:16.252 --> 00:39:18.752
of Him.

00:39:18.752 --> 00:39:20.852
So He married all of them.

00:39:20.852 --> 00:39:32.092
And another point about His life is, that
once these all these ladies, and He had also

00:39:32.092 --> 00:39:33.242
five wives.

00:39:33.242 --> 00:39:42.122
These five wives were the causal of the five
elements.

00:39:42.122 --> 00:39:49.312
So He had to go.

00:39:49.312 --> 00:39:57.542
Once, these ladies wanted to go to see one
great saint.

00:39:57.542 --> 00:40:04.102
And the river, which was there, was all completely
flooded.

00:40:04.102 --> 00:40:11.022
So, they came to Shri Krishna and told Him
that "How are we to cross? - because this

00:40:11.022 --> 00:40:14.142
is over flooded.

00:40:14.142 --> 00:40:18.422
He said "That's very easy to cross that river.

00:40:18.422 --> 00:40:25.962
This river is called as the Virgin River,
Nirmada, now they are having big fights over

00:40:25.962 --> 00:40:29.272
it in India nowadays, a big politics.

00:40:29.272 --> 00:40:42.641
So you go and tell her that "Oh River, if
Shri Krishna is a complete celibate personality,

00:40:42.641 --> 00:40:55.772
perfect brahmachari, if that is the truth,
you go down".

00:40:55.772 --> 00:41:03.252
And the river went down - and they crossed
over.

00:41:03.252 --> 00:41:07.762
Then they went and worshipped the saint and
when they came back to the bank of the river

00:41:07.762 --> 00:41:12.901
it was again very much flooded.

00:41:12.901 --> 00:41:15.532
So they went to that saint and asked him "Now,
how are we to go back?".

00:41:15.532 --> 00:41:17.562
He said "How did you come?".

00:41:17.562 --> 00:41:25.401
They said "this is what Shri Krishna asked
us to tell the river".

00:41:25.401 --> 00:41:34.502
"Alright, you go and tell the river that this
saint has not eaten any food whatsoever, nothing",

00:41:34.502 --> 00:41:43.372
while they saw him eating plates after plates,
if this is the truth, then you better recede.

00:41:43.372 --> 00:41:51.082
So, they went down and told the river, and
the river went down.

00:41:51.082 --> 00:41:57.602
They were amazed that this man ate such a
lot of things and this river has gone down

00:41:57.602 --> 00:42:00.702
thinking this is the truth.

00:42:00.702 --> 00:42:10.262
That means -
what has been their character?.

00:42:10.262 --> 00:42:12.232
They're abhogis.

00:42:12.232 --> 00:42:26.422
They're abhogis means, they do not get, indulge
into it, they eat, all right, but they don't

00:42:26.422 --> 00:42:33.462
care, they don't have that feeling of eating,
and feeling of enjoying the food, and nothing

00:42:33.462 --> 00:42:36.692
of the kind, they are just eating.

00:42:36.692 --> 00:42:48.022
And this gentleman with seventeen, I should
say sixteen thousand and five wives, is called

00:42:48.022 --> 00:42:52.662
as Brahmachari, because they are not involved.

00:42:52.662 --> 00:43:00.392
They are in Sar state.

00:43:00.392 --> 00:43:08.442
With such a great immaculate personality like
Shri Krishna, the way they have created this

00:43:08.442 --> 00:43:11.722
nonsense of romanticism.

00:43:11.722 --> 00:43:26.532
For America, I think they have gone too far
with the freedom they have.

00:43:26.532 --> 00:43:36.992
As people with Shri Krishna's blessings became
free from all the rules, regulations and got

00:43:36.992 --> 00:43:38.022
abandoned.

00:43:38.022 --> 00:43:47.872
But America has gone much worse and not only
that, but the films they are producing are

00:43:47.872 --> 00:43:58.012
very dangerous films and really damaging the
whole world.

00:43:58.012 --> 00:44:04.661
They don't know what sin they are committing,
for thousands and thousands of people in the

00:44:04.661 --> 00:44:16.992
world have taken to all kinds of very destructive
ugly ideas.

00:44:16.992 --> 00:44:25.782
Freud, all right, he's ousted - finished,
he's done already a great harm.

00:44:25.782 --> 00:44:38.161
But what about these films, they are now very
much impressing our Indian directors.

00:44:38.161 --> 00:44:43.752
I think all these directors are guiding Indians
to hell.

00:44:43.752 --> 00:44:49.151
The whole thing is so absurd and so dirty.

00:44:49.151 --> 00:44:53.352
For an Indian mind it is really inconceivable.

00:44:53.352 --> 00:45:05.881
Even, I have seen Americans can't bear it,
it has gone that bad.

00:45:05.881 --> 00:45:12.442
Then other things have started with this freedom
that we have.

00:45:12.442 --> 00:45:24.692
Imagine if Shri Krishna was here, He would
never have put any oil in His head, He would

00:45:24.692 --> 00:45:29.562
have never combed His hair, as He must have
His [indistinct].

00:45:29.562 --> 00:45:36.102
And He might have worn some mod dresses from
America.

00:45:36.102 --> 00:45:41.141
Otherwise, you cannot exist.

00:45:41.141 --> 00:45:44.302
All the junk now has gone all over the world.

00:45:44.302 --> 00:45:58.022
Selling in Moscow, selling in all the developing
countries.

00:45:58.022 --> 00:46:05.641
Only thing, when it was declared that they
have AIDS - people used to buy even second

00:46:05.641 --> 00:46:09.852
hand from the tourists - they threw away all
that.

00:46:09.852 --> 00:46:17.352
They are carrying AIDS all over and drugs
all over.

00:46:17.352 --> 00:46:22.592
It's a destructive force.

00:46:22.592 --> 00:46:34.692
It's a destructive force, which is very active
in this Kali Yuga and so we have to have many

00:46:34.692 --> 00:46:40.462
Sahaja Yogis to fight this destructive force.

00:46:40.462 --> 00:46:50.982
And when they are destructive they are not
hypocritical, that's they think is a very

00:46:50.982 --> 00:46:51.982
great quality.

00:46:51.982 --> 00:46:57.532
But at least with hypocracy you can save some
people but when it's just an open thing everybody

00:46:57.532 --> 00:47:02.332
starts doing that.

00:47:02.332 --> 00:47:11.452
So when you think the time Shri Krishna lived
and the beautiful time they had, of such clean

00:47:11.452 --> 00:47:27.602
life and how He killed all these demons, is
something so beautiful, so energy giving.

00:47:27.602 --> 00:47:34.962
But how many demons there are nowadays in
this world - is it one? is it two?, is it

00:47:34.962 --> 00:47:35.962
ten?

00:47:35.962 --> 00:47:41.881
One is finished, another comes up like a mushroom
that is finished, third one comes up like

00:47:41.881 --> 00:47:43.672
a mushroom.

00:47:43.672 --> 00:47:54.812
And the most fertile land is America.

00:47:54.812 --> 00:48:01.022
So you all have to pay attention to this land
of Shri Krishna.

00:48:01.022 --> 00:48:10.762
Especially Shri Krishna should really start
using His Sudarshana Chakra, would be a good

00:48:10.762 --> 00:48:12.982
idea.

00:48:12.982 --> 00:48:13.982
The time has come.

00:48:13.982 --> 00:48:17.852
That's why I gave you the conch.

00:48:17.852 --> 00:48:23.692
To declare the time has come to clean this
America.

00:48:23.692 --> 00:48:25.732
That is the thing we have to do.

00:48:25.732 --> 00:48:35.612
Today when we worship Shri Krishna, you must
awaken within you yourself that consciousness,

00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:41.902
that now Shri Krishna is within all of you.

00:48:41.902 --> 00:48:54.012
And by your communication, because He's collective,
by your speech, by your songs, by all that

00:48:54.012 --> 00:49:05.982
you use to communicate with others, should
carry the message of peace, of love, of compassion,

00:49:05.982 --> 00:49:15.402
of truth and above all of Sahaja Yoga.

00:49:15.462 --> 00:49:19.172
May God bless you
