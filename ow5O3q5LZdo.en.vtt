00:00:29.344 --> 00:00:35.414
and that gives us our evolutionary ascent.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:45.719
This central force, as I have
shown you here,

00:00:47.171 --> 00:00:55.691
is first in the residual form, kept in the 
triangular bone and is called as Kundalini.

00:00:57.654 --> 00:01:07.724
The word Kundalini, in the Sanskrit language,
means - Kunda means the coil; It means coil.

00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:16.005
Kundalini - when it is a feminine of 
Kundal - Kundal means a coil like the,

00:01:16.005 --> 00:01:21.772
you see, you can say, the curl or a coil.
When the feminine gender is used,

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:31.052
it is called as Kundalini; Now this is the
residual force, which has made the zygote,

00:01:31.052 --> 00:01:35.902
as you call it or you can say, the embryo
and the residual of it settles down there.

00:01:35.902 --> 00:01:40.031
It is much more than that - I'm not going
into details about it how this force,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.660
which force it is; It is a subconscious state,
you can say. That is all your subconscious -

00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:52.065
all your lives - even from amoeba to this
stage. Whatever you have been doing,

00:01:52.065 --> 00:01:59.110
whatever have been your search, whatever
lives you have had, whatever genes you have

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:03.566
passed through, like, we can say, if you
were, say, a liar, it is all recorded.

00:02:04.617 --> 00:02:12.087
Then also it records all that has been
happening in this present life also.

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:17.926
Through this, through this area,
in the subconscious area,

00:02:17.926 --> 00:02:22.125
it passes and is recorded here and
kept everything recorded -

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.510
whatever you are taking and experiencing
and putting to your subconscious.

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:35.000
That subconscious area is all being
recorded in that micro, you can say,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.338
a micro-tape and all that is,
though recorded, has also got the power

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:49.825
to think, coordinate, to organize and to 
use whenever it is required. I mean, we

00:02:49.825 --> 00:02:55.456
cannot think of such a record, or a record
player or we can say, a tape record,

00:02:55.456 --> 00:02:58.846
which works out all these things together.

00:02:59.396 --> 00:03:04.246
It is fantastic to believe that there 
could be such a part but there is.

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:11.279
I mean, even if you see our eyes, they are
fantastic things - I mean, we take them

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.748
for granted, absolutely taken for granted.
We cannot make even one eye with all of

00:03:15.748 --> 00:03:19.766
our scientific knowledge and everything,
we cannot make one living human eye;

00:03:19.766 --> 00:03:27.831
Let us accept it. So, everyone of us have got
two nice eyes, which are such complicated

00:03:27.831 --> 00:03:33.190
things and the way they react and work out. 
There must be some sort of a power behind it,

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.965
some sort of an organization, some sort
of a complete co-related, you can say,

00:03:40.965 --> 00:03:48.469
a big institution, which is actually integrated
and is related to something great that is

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:54.435
managing these eyes. After all, when
supposing, I come to London suddenly from

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:59.603
some Indian forest, here I come I find O
there's a very nice train going, then I find

00:03:59.603 --> 00:04:04.540
a very nice tube station and I find, I'm
moving from places to places and then

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.262
there are all kinds of horrible [UNCLEAR]
for me. Then naturally, I'm confused

00:04:09.262 --> 00:04:12.968
that who's doing all this after all, how
is it that I reach here and I find

00:04:12.968 --> 00:04:19.077
all these things available for me? So, 
there has to be somebody behind this

00:04:19.077 --> 00:04:24.322
but now, you may call it anything - you
may call it Nature God that sort of

00:04:24.322 --> 00:04:28.292
shocks you [UNCLEAR]. You can call
Him anything but there is some power

00:04:28.296 --> 00:04:32.916
that is organizing all this - in the under
current powers about which we should know.

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:36.591
Now, which is the way we can know
this, is the point is;

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:46.138
Either by looking at the films and looking
at the, say, houses or looking at the

00:04:46.448 --> 00:04:53.178
very local factories and things by going
out, meeting people - can you find out,

00:04:53.495 --> 00:04:59.905
do you think? I mean, it's a very simple
housewife search. Supposing, you want to

00:05:00.094 --> 00:05:07.424
find out, say, from where to get her knife
[UNCLEAR]. We don't go to a newspaper

00:05:07.424 --> 00:05:12.945
to find it out - you ask another housewife
about it that,"Where do you get this knife

00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:17.901
twisted like that, you know, from where?"
In the same way, if you have to find out,

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:22.875
what are these undercurrent, we have to 
approach people, who have known

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:28.162
something about it, who show result in their
own lives, those who have talked about it

00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:34.404
and when we go to that and try to find out,
we find they also tally with our current know-how.

00:05:34.404 --> 00:05:39.414
They also talk the same thing as we are 
talking and these are undercurrents within us.

00:05:39.445 --> 00:05:44.595
Now, some of the people, who have talked
about these chakras and about these

00:05:44.595 --> 00:05:48.764
Kundalini rising and all these things that
are shown here, have been looking at it

00:05:48.764 --> 00:05:57.921
and seeing it - no doubt about it. You have
heard about so many people like, you can say, the

00:06:01.772 --> 00:06:06.172
what is the name of that lady who founded
the organization [UNCLEAR]

00:06:06.172 --> 00:06:09.340
- Annie Besant
- Annie Besant [UNCLEAR]

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.473
he has written a lot about it, I mean, for you
English people, it would be a great thing to know

00:06:13.473 --> 00:06:17.731
that she has written it but she just saw 
it. You see, she just saw the thing like,

00:06:17.731 --> 00:06:21.894
I see you, she saw these things inside
her - that means, she was not there;

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:28.940
If you are there, you do not see it. She 
saw these things here. Now, for example,

00:06:28.975 --> 00:06:32.475
this is the chakra she feels - alright?
Normally, they just see their chakras

00:06:32.475 --> 00:06:35.339
I've seen most [UNCLEAR]
see this chakra or this chakra.

00:06:35.339 --> 00:06:39.126
Now, if they have seen, now you are 
seeing that means you are not inside this

00:06:40.402 --> 00:06:45.102
but they have seen it, no doubt, they 
have seen it but they are not there

00:06:45.102 --> 00:06:48.326
and they have not given the method,
how to be inside that.

00:06:48.588 --> 00:06:52.408
From outside you can see Caxton Hall
but you are not inside; This is a very

00:06:52.412 --> 00:06:57.192
important point to know - that to go
inside must be another way

00:06:58.302 --> 00:07:02.160
but from outside, if you see anything -

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:07.010
say this chakra you see from outside, you
may be going round and round and round it

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:12.576
and that's how you are seeing that chakra
and that's why, these people did see -

00:07:12.579 --> 00:07:17.289
no doubt about it - they were not, 
sort of, telling you lies or giving you

00:07:17.297 --> 00:07:19.537
some sort of a false idea about it

00:07:19.537 --> 00:07:26.267
but definitely, what they were describing,
is not what we are seeing. We want to be

00:07:26.267 --> 00:07:32.365
innate, we want to be that. That's why,
some people say that, "Why did You try

00:07:32.365 --> 00:07:36.290
to describe these chakras?" I've heard
people asking Me such questions and none

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.650
of the sahaja yogis will also see these
chakras at all, to begin with

00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:44.249
but they will just feel sometimes,
the Kundalini rising,

00:07:44.249 --> 00:07:47.655
they may see in other people the rising
of the Kundalini through this,

00:07:47.655 --> 00:07:51.731
they can see also the pulsation here, they
can feel it [UNCLEAR], they need not go to

00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:56.481
[UNCLEAR] absolutely an abstract sort
of a cone, which you cannot see but

00:07:56.481 --> 00:08:00.615
you start feeling the Collective Consciousness
- that means, you become that.

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:08.113
Now you don't see your eyes, with which
you see but you have eyes, you know that.

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:16.796
So, the seeing of it has given us some 
idea that there is something beyond.

00:08:16.796 --> 00:08:20.252
They have helped us this way, you can say
that, "Alright, they have seen something,"

00:08:20.252 --> 00:08:24.884
but they have gone by a wrong method by which
they could only see but could not enter it.

00:08:27.426 --> 00:08:34.566
There has to be some force here which
has to give us our evolutionary jump.

00:08:36.505 --> 00:08:41.765
We have evolved from amoeba to this stage,
no doubt and there has to be something

00:08:41.765 --> 00:08:48.157
that has done this job; There is some 
force within us which has done this work.

00:08:49.353 --> 00:08:57.258
If we understand this much, that there
is some purpose in evolution because

00:08:57.258 --> 00:09:01.856
certain things were discarded also. For 
example, big animals like manmoth

00:09:01.856 --> 00:09:06.455
and all those, have been discarded.
Out of them, only elephant remained.

00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:10.631
Then some new animals came up
- some of them have been discarded.

00:09:10.658 --> 00:09:14.378
Then again some were accepted. Some
started growing further and further.

00:09:14.658 --> 00:09:22.409
If there is no purpose of life, in evolution
why should there be a growth of a man

00:09:22.409 --> 00:09:26.476
out of amoeba? - Is the first question you
should ask [UNCLEAR] which none of the

00:09:26.476 --> 00:09:30.895
scientist have ever tried to ask because
they cannot answer it well. But should

00:09:30.895 --> 00:09:35.595
come to us as the first question - why are
we human-beings here sitting down?

00:09:38.404 --> 00:09:42.524
But this question doesn't come to us, 
normally, because we take it for granted

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:48.902
and that is the trick of the Nature. 
That is the trick of Nature, what we call

00:09:49.007 --> 00:09:54.367
as Maya in Sanskrit language, that you
accept the trick of the Nature.

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:57.706
Now, everyone of us know that
we are going to die -

00:09:57.706 --> 00:10:01.536
which is the greatest trick of the Nature.
Once, you see, Buddh was asked by

00:10:01.536 --> 00:10:05.585
by his disciple Shukra. He said, "Which
is the greatest Maya of this world?

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.608
He said, "The greatest Maya of this world 
is, that everyone knows he's going to die

00:10:09.608 --> 00:10:13.188
next moment, he may die next moment.
Nothing can be said about his death but he

00:10:13.188 --> 00:10:18.670
doesn't believe that he's going to die -
is the greatest illusion of this world."

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:23.398
In the same way, we take it for
granted. It is the Nature's skill to us

00:10:23.398 --> 00:10:27.184
that we take it for granted otherwise we
would be all jumping on our heads all the time

00:10:27.184 --> 00:10:29.966
worried about our deaths, doing this,
"Oh, tomorrow we have to die,

00:10:29.966 --> 00:10:34.994
tomorrow we have to evolve, what are
we to do?" This settling within us

00:10:34.994 --> 00:10:39.922
of this, what you call, the shanti shakti,
we have taken for granted is also a power

00:10:39.922 --> 00:10:48.210
given to us by Nature and because of this,
you see, we take for granted our being

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:53.581
as it is we use it and live for it. But in certain 
things we do not take it for granted

00:10:53.581 --> 00:10:58.061
and there where we have gone wrong. This
is evolutionary force, which has to rise

00:10:58.061 --> 00:11:02.931
from here, has to go through this and 
open out this as the ultimate breakthrough

00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:13.456
for human-beings, is unable to be tried.
Why? The reason is, we have spoilt

00:11:13.456 --> 00:11:20.877
all these centers by our efforts, by self 
destroying agencies we have put against ourselves.

00:11:21.636 --> 00:11:25.596
Either we destroy others or we destroy 
ourselves. We cannot sit quietly.

00:11:26.714 --> 00:11:31.134
Both things, according to Me, are just the
same, because if you are a part and parcel

00:11:31.134 --> 00:11:37.803
of a one whole being, then even a part if
that is you, if it is destroyed, is a part

00:11:37.803 --> 00:11:43.323
destroyed in the whole. If you destroy other
parts, then of course, it is the destruction.

00:11:43.643 --> 00:11:46.913
But we only see the destruction of
others but not of our own

00:11:46.913 --> 00:11:48.840
- the way we are destroying ourselves.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:52.083
So, we either move this way - left side
or right side, as I call it,

00:11:52.083 --> 00:11:56.941
form a super-ego and ego all the time - 
either destroying others or destroying ourselves.

00:11:58.705 --> 00:12:04.415
So, this force of sustenance, which has to
rise and has to give us that breakthrough,

00:12:04.415 --> 00:12:10.926
is obstructed by our efforts because
we have no sense of judgment.

00:12:12.147 --> 00:12:16.757
I won't say that Nature has not given us
that power - it has given us this.

00:12:18.706 --> 00:12:23.356
It has also given us punch. You see,
so many people have now

00:12:23.356 --> 00:12:27.934
denied by saying, "No, shut up we don't
believe in it. What's wrong, what's wrong?"

00:12:28.601 --> 00:12:33.391
You may try that but you see that is self
destroying. You have a conscience, no doubt

00:12:33.393 --> 00:12:37.013
you do feel bad about things that you
should not have done, which you did

00:12:37.013 --> 00:12:41.840
just because it was a fashion or because
that was the effort needed. You see, this

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:50.532
effort is born out of our ego. A 
egoistical man cannot sit quiet.

00:12:50.532 --> 00:12:53.721
If you tell him to sit quiet, he'll get up
again. He's a Jack-in-the-box, you see.

00:12:53.721 --> 00:12:57.297
Just ask him to sit down, "Please for a
while just sit down, just keep quiet

00:12:57.297 --> 00:13:01.121
so he will jump in, "No, I must do 
something I'm just wasting my time."

00:13:02.392 --> 00:13:05.972
And this kind of attitude that
develops within us

00:13:06.649 --> 00:13:10.119
in the West - we should say, now, we're
facing the Western people,

00:13:10.119 --> 00:13:15.313
so I should talk about the West. In the 
West has really led to lots of inner

00:13:15.313 --> 00:13:19.951
destructions and poisons that we have got 
within ourselves. Actually, we are not

00:13:21.130 --> 00:13:26.660
war-mongerers at all anymore, we do not
trouble others much but we torture ourselves.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.659
This is what has come to today's situation
as it is, as I find the people over here.

00:13:35.346 --> 00:13:42.146
Though you are the people, who do not 
support any wars or any cruelty outside,

00:13:42.425 --> 00:13:46.455
you are the people who are cruel to 
yourself - you are not kind to yourself.

00:13:46.455 --> 00:13:51.701
You don't love, you have no respect for 
yourself, you have no values about yourself

00:13:51.701 --> 00:13:56.713
and you do not understand how important
is this temple which you have not built -

00:13:56.713 --> 00:14:00.349
has been built from the time you were an
amoeba, today you are a human-being -

00:14:00.349 --> 00:14:04.607
the whole thing has been built-up, specially
for this purpose that the light has to come

00:14:04.607 --> 00:14:10.707
within you, you have to be enlightened. This
has been laid down nicely within [UNCLEAR];

00:14:10.707 --> 00:14:18.270
Among all of you people it is there, existing
within. So these centers that we have,

00:14:18.270 --> 00:14:24.410
all of them, are - one center is down below
there - is the red one as I shown here,

00:14:24.412 --> 00:14:32.642
is called as the Mooladhara chakra; It means
the root of the support or you can say,

00:14:32.642 --> 00:14:36.832
the support of the root, you can say - 
support of the root, Mooladhar,

00:14:36.832 --> 00:14:40.835
support of the root. Which is the root?
Root is this one here

00:14:40.835 --> 00:14:48.887
and it is a support of the root and in
scientific words you cannot understand

00:14:48.887 --> 00:14:58.044
what is the root of the person
or personality -

00:14:58.806 --> 00:15:05.086
you cannot say which is the root, what are
your roots. I mean, you cannot say that,

00:15:05.086 --> 00:15:09.282
"I came from England and I came from
West Indies," - that's not the thing.

00:15:09.282 --> 00:15:16.655
What are your roots? From where have you 
come and where have you to go? This is the

00:15:16.655 --> 00:15:25.995
support of that root which is going to 
manifest your personality and this support

00:15:25.995 --> 00:15:32.007
extremely simple to understand this
innocence - is the innocence.

00:15:32.597 --> 00:15:35.767
Innocence has been given to
us by Nature.

00:15:37.817 --> 00:15:45.199
We may lose it but it is there and
this is the sign where it exists.

00:15:46.429 --> 00:15:54.539
Innocence is in the animals, it is in
all the matter; The matter is innocent.

00:15:56.756 --> 00:16:02.676
It neither attacks you nor it attacks 
itself - is innocent.

00:16:04.176 --> 00:16:08.899
You can use it whichever way you like
but the matter is acting innocent.

00:16:08.899 --> 00:16:13.455
In the way, we can understand that it is,
we can say, that it is neut -

00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:17.047
it has no thinking about it 
so it is innocent.

00:16:17.421 --> 00:16:23.751
You are the only people, human-beings,
have got the power either to be innocent

00:16:23.751 --> 00:16:29.699
or to be destroying that innocence within
us. So, this is their root. This is the root

00:16:30.836 --> 00:16:35.936
and the root has got the support that is
innocence. So, your roots have got the support,

00:16:35.936 --> 00:16:42.556
the feeling of the root is innocence. Or
you can say, the roots are embedded

00:16:42.557 --> 00:16:49.817
in the innocence. The whole creation was 
created after innocence was generated

00:16:50.179 --> 00:16:55.169
not the [UNCLEAR]. So innocence is such a
big blessing and that is the innocence.

00:16:55.169 --> 00:17:02.072
Now, in scientific terminology, you cannot
talk of innocence. Innocence is a part of

00:17:02.072 --> 00:17:07.062
human-beings you all know. In the children
you find the innocence very clearly

00:17:07.383 --> 00:17:10.933
how they express their innocence.
Now the new theory,

00:17:11.303 --> 00:17:13.922
I mean, I was amazed when I came in
this country, to hear that

00:17:13.922 --> 00:17:17.354
there are people who believe
that children are the most

00:17:18.107 --> 00:17:24.827
ego-oriented, extremely possessive and
they are very dominating creatures.

00:17:25.323 --> 00:17:29.613
I was shocked at this; I mean, this theory
just doesn't tally with ours, you see.

00:17:29.613 --> 00:17:32.146
I said, "Now what these scientists have
found out, God alone knows,"

00:17:32.146 --> 00:17:35.582
but by God's Grace now they have
found out it was a wrong thing.

00:17:36.315 --> 00:17:40.445
What happened that they found, a child,
if you put before a child a ball,

00:17:40.445 --> 00:17:44.538
say example, hanging before him
and the child tries to grab the ball

00:17:44.538 --> 00:17:47.891
- that's what they detected from the
movements of the child's hands

00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:51.942
but later on, when they watched the child
later on, you see, they found that it is

00:17:51.942 --> 00:17:58.376
not so because you can see in life how 
children are generous, so they couldn't

00:17:58.376 --> 00:18:02.163
understand, why this in the beginning
children behave in this manner. Then they

00:18:02.163 --> 00:18:07.426
found out that, if you have a slow motion 
picture, absolutely a slow motion picture,

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:12.940
then you find, that the small children are
moving their hands just like toys

00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:19.360
because they have got a flying capacity
and they are trying to try that flying

00:18:19.962 --> 00:18:24.462
trick that they know and they just do
flying - it's not the grabbing

00:18:24.469 --> 00:18:27.629
but is the flying; Their hands move
like this just like flying

00:18:27.629 --> 00:18:30.784
with the impulse that they see
something, they start flying.

00:18:31.537 --> 00:18:36.377
Now just imagine, what a big mistake it
was, to treat your children on these basis

00:18:36.377 --> 00:18:40.674
that they are very ego-oriented,
that they are very possessive. Now,

00:18:41.502 --> 00:18:46.272
such mistakes are committed and something
terrible all the people have done -

00:18:46.272 --> 00:18:52.478
one of them has been done to this center
also. Because when you start finding out

00:18:52.478 --> 00:19:01.689
things through effort, you can just break
your nose, can just clip off your ears -

00:19:01.969 --> 00:19:07.836
anything can happen because you are moving
into dark. So first we must ask for

00:19:07.836 --> 00:19:12.659
enlightenment, we must ask for the light
to see what are we doing. This is the

00:19:12.659 --> 00:19:17.519
first thing that we have to ask for. If 
there is no light, whatever you are doing,

00:19:17.519 --> 00:19:23.062
you are not doing, you do not know what
you are doing. This is a jarring example.

00:19:23.062 --> 00:19:27.852
I mean, imagine all the children of the 
world, get condemned by this great theory

00:19:27.852 --> 00:19:31.510
that came out of somebody's brains, that
they are trying to grab everything.

00:19:33.398 --> 00:19:37.298
They have no sense of possession, they 
have no sense of, you see, they do not

00:19:37.298 --> 00:19:41.320
understand your economic things and they
do not understand how much an antique

00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:46.543
costs and how much does that cost. How can
they do all these things but even such a

00:19:46.543 --> 00:19:50.237
horrible theory was accepted and you know
the result of it - that the way you have

00:19:50.237 --> 00:19:54.305
been treating our children, has been 
terrible. But now, when one theory has been

00:19:54.305 --> 00:19:57.640
accepted by which people have suffered,
I don't know how much time it will take

00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:01.368
because another theory to come up to
be kind to these children of ours.

00:20:02.884 --> 00:20:09.544
In the same way, the theories about this
center have been very, very, absolutely so

00:20:09.544 --> 00:20:16.298
damaging, so damaging that your, you see,
person like Me, I get a fear to think about it.

00:20:16.499 --> 00:20:22.709
This center, is a very important center 
because it is your, the support of your root,

00:20:22.804 --> 00:20:28.804
it is the support of your root and on this
center, people have written books after books

00:20:28.804 --> 00:20:35.628
by saying, that this is the center which
controls the sex and they got this

00:20:35.628 --> 00:20:41.481
wonderful idea that this center because
it is there and it is at the support

00:20:41.481 --> 00:20:46.284
and because it controls the sex and 
because they have seen it there -

00:20:46.284 --> 00:20:48.650
also they have seen the deity there sits,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:54.036
which has got a trunk like a 
elephant, so they have called it that the

00:20:54.036 --> 00:21:01.794
Kundalini itself, the residual force 
itself sits there. Now, this is one of the

00:21:01.794 --> 00:21:06.192
greatest and the gravest mistake that
these tantrikas have done

00:21:06.192 --> 00:21:08.735
to all the seekers of the world.

00:21:11.658 --> 00:21:17.408
Sex is important, is sacred, something 
great, human-beings must have it,

00:21:17.408 --> 00:21:21.700
they have to have children, if they have 
to have development of their being.

00:21:21.700 --> 00:21:28.061
There's nothing wrong in sex and sex has 
to be properly appreciated and is to be

00:21:28.061 --> 00:21:37.155
respected in it's proper way and it's not 
to be vulgar but it has to be innocent sex

00:21:37.155 --> 00:21:42.214
which should be spontaneous and not 
deliberate by thinking about it and

00:21:42.214 --> 00:21:45.420
pornography. The more these people do
pornography and all that, the more they

00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:52.894
will become impotent because it is potent
only under circumstances where it is

00:21:52.894 --> 00:21:58.606
allowed to be spontaneous - is a very great
danger all of you are facing, when you do

00:21:58.606 --> 00:22:05.171
so much about it. Allow it to work out 
more spontaneously in the sacred way.

00:22:07.043 --> 00:22:11.513
Is the most beautiful thing to be enjoyed
by all of you - God has given you that

00:22:11.513 --> 00:22:17.545
but the way we have ruined it now, you
have no idea how most we have lost that,

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:23.902
how much the whole thing is just the
opposite of it. I mean, it's joy giving -

00:22:24.253 --> 00:22:31.693
it will never give you joy but obsession. 
So, first of all I must tell you, that

00:22:31.693 --> 00:22:38.935
there is nothing wrong in sex but when
you start thinking that sex can give you

00:22:38.935 --> 00:22:45.283
realization or that the Kundalini is 
sitting at the sex point, that you have to

00:22:45.283 --> 00:22:49.958
do sex for that, that is the end of 
everything - that is Hell, I tell you.

00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:55.030
We have had some disciples here, you have
seen, the some people came to us and they

00:22:55.030 --> 00:23:02.124
told they went to some lama, who did sex
into them. Imagine Buddha's disciples

00:23:02.129 --> 00:23:06.269
doing like this, I mean, I cannot imagine
things like that. Even Christians, how can

00:23:06.269 --> 00:23:14.006
they believe a thing like that, that you
can achieve realization through sex.

00:23:14.835 --> 00:23:18.705
Sex energy, I don't know what you call
that, you see, see after another blind

00:23:18.705 --> 00:23:23.646
person was Mr. Freud, absolutely blind; He
didn't know much about the whole, whole

00:23:23.646 --> 00:23:28.166
being, he knew just a part of it, he knew
a very little part of it, he did not know

00:23:28.166 --> 00:23:37.047
much of it. He had ideas about these things
from his own life, from his own character,

00:23:37.047 --> 00:23:42.208
the way he was biased about things and the
foremost thing, he played on our weakness.

00:23:45.167 --> 00:23:50.587
You see, somebody plays on our weaknesses,
tries to be nice to us, we must understand

00:23:50.587 --> 00:23:55.534
he's our weakness and if he plays on our
strength, he's our friend and that's how

00:23:55.534 --> 00:24:02.049
he did it and that's how he completely 
brainwashed people over here, to say that,

00:24:02.049 --> 00:24:06.598
"Sex activity should be, there should be no
inhibition, there should be liberation, this and this."

00:24:06.598 --> 00:24:10.293
What is this liberation? - Is enslavement
of sex morning till evening.

00:24:11.345 --> 00:24:13.905
Is it liberation by any chance?

00:24:15.885 --> 00:24:21.295
You are liberated when you can master
it but when you are in slave of it,

00:24:21.295 --> 00:24:26.279
you cannot even control your eyes for two
minutes, what sort of a liberation it is?

00:24:28.628 --> 00:24:34.748
And that's why we have to understand fully
well, that sex has to be respected,

00:24:34.748 --> 00:24:40.873
has to be sacred and is right, even today
when we call it a liberated society.

00:24:41.682 --> 00:24:46.962
Still, still whatever you may try, you see, you
cannot create a complete vacuum I can see.

00:24:46.962 --> 00:24:54.199
Even now, I do not find people doing sex
on the street. Still I have seen, you see,

00:24:54.199 --> 00:25:00.185
many old people having young girls around
and all that of it, on the street, I don't see.

00:25:00.185 --> 00:25:05.906
Still they feel shy. It's just their shyness
in them. Still then, whatever you may try

00:25:05.906 --> 00:25:12.225
with your liberty or things like that, still
a man feels hurt if his sister is raped.

00:25:14.625 --> 00:25:19.115
Still there are so many things, if you see
that, you don't like the way things are.

00:25:19.142 --> 00:25:25.262
There is absolutely a gift to all of us, 
even today when you are supposed to be

00:25:25.289 --> 00:25:29.119
so liberated, I have yet to come across a 
man and a woman, really if you talk to

00:25:29.119 --> 00:25:35.491
them personally, who are not jealous. Why
should you be jealous? You are not jealous

00:25:35.491 --> 00:25:39.889
if ten people are into it together. Why 
are you jealous? If one woman tries to

00:25:39.894 --> 00:25:45.094
spoil another family or a one man spoils
another woman's family life, why should

00:25:45.094 --> 00:25:51.432
they be jealous? All these have been built
within us and this is a very important point

00:25:51.432 --> 00:25:57.241
which we neglect; Because of this, we have
lost all the joy of life. All the joy of

00:25:57.241 --> 00:26:02.518
life is lost completely because sex is for
giving you joy and not frustration.

00:26:06.091 --> 00:26:13.541
In this chakra there is a deity, who came
as Christ on this Earth - He's an

00:26:13.541 --> 00:26:21.583
embodiment of innocence and He is the
deity, which was created, first of all,

00:26:21.583 --> 00:26:30.640
as Shri Ganesha, as we call Him, who has a
trunk of a, of an elephant. Now, there's

00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:35.966
a story behind it also why [UNCLEAR] has
been given but a simple thing is, that an

00:26:35.966 --> 00:26:41.667
an animal, any animal, does not have these
things closed as He has - like the ego and

00:26:41.667 --> 00:26:49.912
super-ego, like the fontanel bone is not closed
in the animals - means they remain innocent.

00:26:49.912 --> 00:26:54.566
Once this is closed here, then the
innocence is lost, in the sense that

00:26:54.566 --> 00:26:59.012
you have given I-ness; You become Mr. Such
and Such, you become Mr. Such and Such

00:26:59.012 --> 00:27:03.921
and you become a different personality.
This is not among animals at all. Only

00:27:03.921 --> 00:27:09.468
at the human stage you are
given the I-ness.

00:27:09.468 --> 00:27:14.488
Has a reason for that also, this I-ness 
is given and that is why

00:27:14.488 --> 00:27:21.997
the child Ganesha has no ego. He's
directly connected with the Divine

00:27:22.021 --> 00:27:26.551
and whatever He works out, is only the
work of the Divine. He is not at all

00:27:26.551 --> 00:27:29.312
putting His ego or super-ego in between;

00:27:29.313 --> 00:27:34.413
It's a hollow personality. Is a hollow, we
can say, a very hollow

00:27:35.194 --> 00:27:42.114
entity or you can say, a Deity, which is
being used to permeate innocence

00:27:42.114 --> 00:27:46.891
on this earth and that was Christ. I wonder,
how many of us know really, the great

00:27:46.891 --> 00:27:53.390
nature of Christ. Morning till evening we
say, "O Christ," this one will say, "O Christ,"

00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:57.110
doing all sorts of nonsensical things,
which should not be done in the presence

00:27:57.110 --> 00:28:02.340
of Christ but we do and we think we are 
Christians. To understand His nature, you

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:09.983
have to master this center. I will never say
that you give up married life - not at all.

00:28:09.983 --> 00:28:15.203
You all should get married, must have families,
must live a very normal family life

00:28:15.779 --> 00:28:20.399
absolutely - that's not the point but there
should be sacredness about this

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:26.114
because the greatest Deity, is the greatest
of all because He's the principle of life,

00:28:26.386 --> 00:28:30.446
is the tatwamasi, as you call the tatwa
and is the principle of life, is innocence

00:28:30.446 --> 00:28:35.559
and that is sitting down there and you
see children have no sense of sex at all.

00:28:35.559 --> 00:28:39.882
Now, this Mr. great, Freud, I don't know
from where he detected certain things,

00:28:39.882 --> 00:28:43.779
saying that the children have got this
and all that - is all nonsense.

00:28:44.239 --> 00:28:49.135
He just knows one side is this side 
that too, up to, I don't know,

00:28:49.135 --> 00:28:53.078
how much point he knows. He was
not meditative at all.

00:28:55.123 --> 00:28:58.843
You cannot know these things by 
judging some pathological cases.

00:28:58.849 --> 00:29:02.669
He himself was a pathological case, I 
would say, he was a Psychopath himself

00:29:04.032 --> 00:29:08.672
and the people, who came to him, were all 
psychopaths and pathological cases cannot

00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:15.389
determine what these are the [UNCLEAR].
They cannot say, normal people, he never

00:29:15.389 --> 00:29:19.727
treated normal people. I mean, normal do
not go near him. I mean, people are shocked,

00:29:19.727 --> 00:29:24.872
you know, when they heard such things. In
India, how [UNCLEAR] they say, "He's mad."

00:29:24.887 --> 00:29:28.222
Nobody believes in all this. If you go and
tell them, they'll say, "O, oh you tell

00:29:28.222 --> 00:29:32.851
somebody else, we know them." Such mad
people are born again and again on this earth.

00:29:34.215 --> 00:29:38.815
But for us, you see, he proved us through
the psychological cases. Now supposing,

00:29:38.815 --> 00:29:44.030
take a case of a doctor. Now, he's treating
ulcer or say, he's treating, some sort of a,

00:29:44.030 --> 00:29:48.278
he's treating cancer. So, he takes a cancer
patient and says, "This is cancer and

00:29:48.278 --> 00:29:52.194
this has happened and this has happened,"
and then he says, "Everybody has cancer."

00:29:52.194 --> 00:30:00.359
Will you accept it? These are all psychological
cases which he has dealt with and naturally

00:30:00.359 --> 00:30:04.684
they are psychological because they are
abnormal, so that is not normal - is a

00:30:04.684 --> 00:30:10.083
simple deduction but, I don't know, how he 
reached that point; Never take them seriously.

00:30:11.448 --> 00:30:18.288
Have they tried any normal people, natural
people? And that's why, you see, when

00:30:18.288 --> 00:30:22.524
these people tried - I wouldn't say, that he
did it for money or anything - he really,

00:30:22.524 --> 00:30:26.865
really just he believed in it what he did
but it was such a partial truth and

00:30:26.865 --> 00:30:32.515
partial truth can be very injurious and can be
very dangerous but the way we accepted him

00:30:32.515 --> 00:30:36.949
has created this problem for us of the
left hand side, as I call it, that it is

00:30:36.949 --> 00:30:43.797
not from where we stand, as far as the sex 
is concerned. One should have a clear cut idea

00:30:43.797 --> 00:30:49.961
as to how we lead a sex life. But you don't
have to discuss about it and sit down and

00:30:51.268 --> 00:30:57.998
allow the spontaneity to work it out. This
is what it is because, the deity there,

00:30:57.998 --> 00:31:03.999
is innocent. Children don't understand
sex, they don't understand private part

00:31:03.999 --> 00:31:09.180
or anything - they do not. If you are 
nude, they will just say, "You have this

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:13.429
and you have that," and they talk so sweetly
about it - they do not understand it is

00:31:13.429 --> 00:31:18.994
private. Only when you grow this, again
the development of this fontanel bone

00:31:18.994 --> 00:31:24.856
being calcified, that is the only time 
when we start thinking about this and the

00:31:24.856 --> 00:31:29.143
shyness starts. I think, that might be the
point when we can say, Eve and Adam got

00:31:29.143 --> 00:31:34.781
their freedom. Eve and Adam got their
freedom by becoming themselves, by this

00:31:34.781 --> 00:31:41.273
fontanel bone being absolutely calcified.
At this juncture when you become

00:31:41.273 --> 00:31:46.408
absolutely independent, it is, you are 
made because you have to evolve like a

00:31:46.408 --> 00:31:50.847
[UNCLEAR] more than what you are.
You have to find out things, somethings,

00:31:50.847 --> 00:31:54.974
some of the things which you should
know and deduct by your wisdom.

00:31:54.974 --> 00:31:58.299
You have to learn how to use your 
wisdom because you are the people,

00:31:58.299 --> 00:32:03.100
who are the flowers, who are the blossoms
of this creation, the whole creation

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:07.193
- imagine you are the people!
And if you are not even independent

00:32:07.193 --> 00:32:11.176
to decide for yourself, if you are still 
children and not matured enough to decide,

00:32:11.394 --> 00:32:15.304
then what's the use of giving realization
to you? You have to understand this

00:32:15.304 --> 00:32:18.532
dynamic force, you have to use it, you 
have to maneuvre it, you have to give

00:32:18.532 --> 00:32:22.230
realization to people and you have to 
change the whole world; All this has to be

00:32:22.230 --> 00:32:26.849
done through your agency and such people,
if they are still like babies and they

00:32:26.849 --> 00:32:32.281
don't understand what to do about things
[UNCLEAR]. That's why, at this stage, at the

00:32:32.281 --> 00:32:37.596
human stage God has [UNCLEAR], I shouldn't
say God but Nature has closed this.

00:32:39.576 --> 00:32:45.120
It closes down. Why? Why don't we ask
ourselves? Why does it close down here?

00:32:45.342 --> 00:32:50.292
Animals don't close it; Why do we 
have to calcify to close here?

00:32:50.492 --> 00:32:53.102
Why human-beings do it? How they do it?

00:32:53.272 --> 00:32:58.687
We never think about it. So, you are 
special, you are made like that,

00:32:58.687 --> 00:33:04.114
you have special ideas, you understand
things much more, you are definitely

00:33:04.114 --> 00:33:09.397
evolved in the sense, you have greater sense of 
awareness. You understand what is beauty,

00:33:09.397 --> 00:33:14.183
you understand what is filth to begin with
- animals do not. Whether take a horse

00:33:14.183 --> 00:33:18.712
or a lion, for them filth is nothing. They
do not know what is filth. You pass them

00:33:18.712 --> 00:33:24.701
through any dirty place for them it has no
meaning. You take them to any filthy area,

00:33:24.701 --> 00:33:29.292
they will sit down there nicely and enjoy
themselves. They are not going to bother

00:33:29.292 --> 00:33:33.106
about, whether there are flowers or not,
whether there are gardens or not - they

00:33:33.106 --> 00:33:37.633
are not bothered, so the first thing is,
we find that, they have no sense of

00:33:37.633 --> 00:33:40.716
fragrance knowledge. This is also 
the same center gives you -

00:33:40.716 --> 00:33:45.719
the sense of fragrance. Now, the fragrance
has gone to such a limit,

00:33:46.445 --> 00:33:51.395
you see, we have nice perfumes
- we use lots of perfumes

00:33:51.395 --> 00:33:56.414
because we cannot stand filthy odor and 
things like that - but animals, do they

00:33:56.414 --> 00:34:02.983
need any perfumes? They can live, they are
quite happy about it. They are not bothered

00:34:02.983 --> 00:34:09.413
as to whether they are in an atmosphere
where there is perfume or not

00:34:09.413 --> 00:34:11.925
but they have a sense of smell, no doubt.

00:34:12.768 --> 00:34:17.358
Sense of smell they have but not the
sense of fragrance that we have.

00:34:17.476 --> 00:34:21.147
We are specially blessed to have a sense
of fragrance because later on you will know

00:34:21.147 --> 00:34:27.153
after realization, that sense of fragrance
helps you to recognize the realized souls

00:34:27.153 --> 00:34:32.180
and not only realized souls but also the
person whom we call as Incarnation.

00:34:32.180 --> 00:34:36.485
I wish people had that sense, when Christ
was born - they would have never allowed

00:34:36.485 --> 00:34:42.295
this crucifixion. Then you understand who
has the fragrance and who does not.

00:34:43.175 --> 00:34:51.405
So, the sense of fragrance is developed in
this center. We have another sense in

00:34:51.405 --> 00:34:58.447
this center. Human-beings have a special
sense of aesthetics. Animals don't have

00:34:58.447 --> 00:35:03.097
any aesthetics. Whether you put red, black,
yellow, anything makes no difference to them.

00:35:03.097 --> 00:35:07.469
They know the color. They have a color 
sense alright. They have color sense.

00:35:07.469 --> 00:35:10.754
Supposing, you show them red light first
and give them a food to eat and then

00:35:10.754 --> 00:35:13.188
give them blue light and don't
give any food.

00:35:13.188 --> 00:35:16.953
As soon as you put the red light,
their saliva glands will start secreting

00:35:16.953 --> 00:35:21.408
- means they have a sense of color but
they have no sense of aesthetics.

00:35:21.633 --> 00:35:26.253
They cannot understand what is seen up, 
picture of this place, how it is placed,

00:35:26.253 --> 00:35:29.583
is it proportionate or not - it's proportionate.
Wherever they are, if you give them

00:35:29.583 --> 00:35:34.533
food to eat, they will eat but for us the
food must be laid down in a way

00:35:34.533 --> 00:35:38.427
that it should be appealing to our aesthetics
otherwise we don't feel like eating.

00:35:38.427 --> 00:35:41.528
It is looking horrid, then we just don't
want to eat. We are very sensitive

00:35:41.528 --> 00:35:45.751
people, if you see that - we are
extremely sensitive, it's true. To understand

00:35:45.751 --> 00:35:50.201
aesthetics, you see, we take it for 
granted. We just take it for granted

00:35:50.201 --> 00:35:55.450
that we have aesthetics and the more the
society is improving, the aesthetics are

00:35:55.450 --> 00:36:01.512
improving. People are very aesthetically
sensitive in the West, extremely

00:36:01.512 --> 00:36:10.168
aesthetically equipped - they understand
what are the [UNCLEAR]. This, this center

00:36:10.168 --> 00:36:16.777
of creativity within us gives us the subtle
point of aesthetics within human-beings

00:36:16.777 --> 00:36:23.115
which is higher than animals. But then,
what is the higher sense of [UNCLEAR].

00:36:23.115 --> 00:36:27.504
As I've told you about the fragrance. 
Now, aesthetics are alright. We see the

00:36:27.504 --> 00:36:31.019
color of this and that and that,
but we have no spiritual aesthetics.

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:34.064
We do not understand spiritual aesthetics.

00:36:34.064 --> 00:36:37.909
That is only possible after realization
that you immediately

00:36:37.909 --> 00:36:43.006
understand what is spiritual aesthetics
because you start getting vibrations.

00:36:43.376 --> 00:36:47.669
Aesthetically whatever is absolutely 
correct, will only give vibrations.

00:36:47.669 --> 00:36:53.469
There is a coefficience which works out a
formula, which works out these vibrations.

00:36:53.469 --> 00:36:59.899
A thing may look horrid to us, if you
say, "Now, this is an art." [UNCLEAR]

00:36:59.899 --> 00:37:04.739
I don't know how it is but just can't look
at it - it's terrible but it has got an

00:37:04.739 --> 00:37:08.949
academic award, I don't know, how people
have given it, what have they judged it for.

00:37:08.949 --> 00:37:13.639
Now, after realization you see, then you
will be able to decide exactly whether

00:37:13.639 --> 00:37:17.689
it is aesthetically correct or not. If it
is correct, it will be vibrating.

00:37:18.709 --> 00:37:22.989
Like we'll say Mozart now. To you Mozart
or anybody else is just the same. To Me

00:37:22.989 --> 00:37:27.817
Mozart is great because as soon as you
play his music, vibrations start flowing.

00:37:31.987 --> 00:37:36.347
We have artists like that. We have many 
artists who you may think that, "Very good

00:37:36.347 --> 00:37:41.837
he's playing and this and that," but an 
artist who is a realized soul, you can

00:37:41.837 --> 00:37:45.777
immediately understand that he is the best
that will give you greatest pleasure.

00:37:46.127 --> 00:37:51.697
The joy giving quality of an particular
art is to be greater for a spiritually

00:37:51.697 --> 00:37:58.447
awakened person than for another ordinary
type because he can feel the joy coming

00:37:58.447 --> 00:38:01.817
into him - he does not have to talk, you
are in thoughtless awareness, you are just

00:38:01.817 --> 00:38:05.727
watching the thing and the joy is pouring
into you and you feel so happy with

00:38:05.727 --> 00:38:11.277
the whole thing - you just [UNCLEAR]. 
So , there are some great artists, who

00:38:11.277 --> 00:38:15.597
might have been neglected and have been
rejected by the society, abused because

00:38:15.597 --> 00:38:20.267
these days, you see, an artist must show a new 
rule - that's important. If it is not new,

00:38:20.267 --> 00:38:27.757
it is not art. Everything is ending up in 
the market, you see, so not necessarily,

00:38:27.757 --> 00:38:32.797
a new picture may give proper vibrations, 
may not be vibrations. The person, who has

00:38:32.797 --> 00:38:37.087
made it, is very important. If the person
who has made it, is a realized soul,

00:38:37.087 --> 00:38:40.267
he cannot make anything that is
not aesthetically correct -

00:38:40.267 --> 00:38:43.567
he cannot because, you see, he goes on
balancing, balancing

00:38:43.567 --> 00:38:47.509
till he feels happy. When he feels happy,
means he gets vibrations and he feels

00:38:47.509 --> 00:38:52.977
happy about it so you get the real thing.
For example, some of the paintings of Christ,

00:38:52.977 --> 00:38:58.417
I mean, there are [UNCLEAR] it cannot
bear them, the lanky, panky Christ

00:38:58.417 --> 00:39:01.486
absolutely looking so miserable - I think,
it's the projection of the artist

00:39:01.486 --> 00:39:04.556
himself, to show Him miserable. 
Now, we can understand,

00:39:04.556 --> 00:39:07.833
if even with rationality, how can
a person, like Christ

00:39:07.833 --> 00:39:11.056
be that miserable - the One, who has
come to remove the miseries of the

00:39:11.056 --> 00:39:15.036
whole world, looking that miserable and
lanky, panky fellow, that everybody should

00:39:15.036 --> 00:39:20.996
have pity on Him; We must have
reverence. We should see His body and face

00:39:20.996 --> 00:39:25.346
we should depend on Him - He is the support 
of the whole world - that's how He's been

00:39:25.346 --> 00:39:29.816
described and how can we have such a 
dainty darling there, weeping and crying

00:39:29.816 --> 00:39:38.646
and melancholy fellow. See, this is the 
idea we have got about art, which should

00:39:38.646 --> 00:39:44.466
complete later, the joy, the bubbling joy 
we can see in things and in paintings and

00:39:44.466 --> 00:39:51.116
in the faces also. Then our aesthetics 
change, absolutely change and we start

00:39:51.116 --> 00:39:56.146
enjoying it in the real sense, not that
somebody has given you an award, so you

00:39:56.146 --> 00:40:01.336
have to think, "Yes, it is. They have given an
award, so there must be something about it."

00:40:01.336 --> 00:40:05.696
You must sit down and work it out. No, it 
is not to be worked out, it is spontaneous

00:40:05.696 --> 00:40:10.036
[UNCLEAR]. As soon as you feel the joy, 
you're great and you'll see the thing and

00:40:10.036 --> 00:40:13.696
it's, "Oh, that's it, that's it," just 
enjoy and you do not talk about it, think

00:40:13.696 --> 00:40:18.066
about it but the joy itself, which was in 
the heart of the artist, is reflected in

00:40:18.066 --> 00:40:22.255
your own being and you start the whole 
thing rippling, completely rippling with joy

00:40:22.255 --> 00:40:26.025
and that is the spontaneous thing that
should happen to all of us and not this

00:40:26.495 --> 00:40:31.555
working it out, thinking it, writing 
criticism for it - what is the criticism?

00:40:31.555 --> 00:40:35.995
As soon as you see it, you know it is there. 
A child can make it out better than we

00:40:35.995 --> 00:40:43.605
because we are so complicated. Even joy, 
you want to think about it - mean how can

00:40:43.605 --> 00:40:48.565
to Me a person, I'm different type, you see,
I cannot understand, how can you sit down

00:40:48.565 --> 00:40:53.185
and describe joy? I've seen people describing,
even a painting. How can you describe?

00:40:53.185 --> 00:40:58.695
You just look at it and you know, "O, it is
joy," but you have to be that to feel it.

00:40:58.695 --> 00:41:05.635
When this center is enlightened, then you
get the sense of aesthetics, which are

00:41:05.635 --> 00:41:11.005
Spiritual. In India, now there are many
temples, as you must have heard, are,

00:41:11.775 --> 00:41:17.335
there are temples, where, you see, there
are living deities are there - it's a fact.

00:41:18.375 --> 00:41:24.095
Now, in the Bible, if you read what is not
allowed, is that you are not going to recreate

00:41:24.095 --> 00:41:29.395
anything that is created in the Earth, on
the Earth or in the Heavens; Means, those

00:41:29.395 --> 00:41:33.855
which are created by Mother Earth as
living deities, you should not recreate them

00:41:34.105 --> 00:41:38.725
because when you start recreating, you
being non-realized people, you will be

00:41:38.725 --> 00:41:42.175
putting your ideas into it, you'll be making
money out of it, you'll be selling them

00:41:42.175 --> 00:41:46.465
in the market and that's how you'll spoil
the whole complete vibrations and it is

00:41:46.465 --> 00:41:52.345
very, very difficult to get even a sensible
deity element whether in India or anywhere.

00:41:52.345 --> 00:41:56.855
I've seen many temples, many churches and
what I find, they're all good for nothing

00:41:56.855 --> 00:42:02.697
- useless but there are some very good 
ones also. For example, I went to Paris and

00:42:03.308 --> 00:42:10.388
this [NAME UNCLEAR - NOTRE- DAME?], 
you see, there's the statue of the Mother,

00:42:10.388 --> 00:42:17.750
is absolutely emit vibrations - absolute -
the one who has made it has [UNCLEAR].

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:23.831
The other day, I found a very nice marble
statue made of - I don't know where it was

00:42:23.831 --> 00:42:29.946
made of a Victorian material and they just
picked it up from the one junk shop and

00:42:29.946 --> 00:42:34.159
it's beautiful, it has got vibrations; If 
you're realized, you can seek for this.

00:42:34.159 --> 00:42:37.495
This sense is developed in enlightened 
being. I'm answering your question

00:42:37.495 --> 00:42:42.292
throughout, if you see. You see, you had
asked Me, "What is enlightenment?" See, now.

00:42:42.292 --> 00:42:47.692
So this is your first enlightenment, that
you know the fragrance of a realized soul;

00:42:47.836 --> 00:42:52.626
Is the first one. The second center gives 
you the idea of Spiritual aesthetics.

00:42:54.632 --> 00:43:00.962
Who is spiritually awakened? You'll find 
now, many people who give realization,

00:43:00.962 --> 00:43:04.414
how some body nice comes in - everybody will, 
"Come, come, come, come see his vibrations,"

00:43:04.414 --> 00:43:07.814
and they're like children sitting and 
taking all the vibrations and feeling it

00:43:07.814 --> 00:43:12.030
so nice within themselves, "O, come, come,
see." Maybe, the person is a poor man,

00:43:12.030 --> 00:43:17.707
maybe, the person is from a very low 
caste or maybe low society or whatever

00:43:17.707 --> 00:43:22.535
it is but see the vibrations - so beautiful!
We had somebody making in our building,

00:43:22.535 --> 00:43:26.619
somebody was preparing our roof, you see
and we had to lift up something, so some

00:43:26.619 --> 00:43:31.180
of the sahaja yogis came down to help Me
there and they said, "We'll call some gentleman."

00:43:31.180 --> 00:43:33.873
So the one who came to us, you see,
they all were enamored. They said,

00:43:33.873 --> 00:43:37.922
"Look at this one! He's had some [UNCLEAR]
and why were they were so much appreciating,

00:43:37.922 --> 00:43:42.358
he's an ordinary beggar," but, see they,
and they called him again and again and

00:43:42.358 --> 00:43:45.975
I also said, "What can I do for you and 
all that," so he couldn't understand, why

00:43:45.975 --> 00:43:52.724
was he so important to us but he was emitting
vibrations. So, this is a thing, is that

00:43:52.724 --> 00:43:58.207
by through this you know how, how the 
aesthetics are correct vibration-wise.

00:43:58.225 --> 00:44:04.455
Secondly, by developing this, by 
enlightenment of this, you also create things

00:44:04.455 --> 00:44:10.674
which are correct spiritually, absolutely
correct. Those who will make anything,

00:44:10.674 --> 00:44:16.481
even a child who's a realized soul, you see,
it will make something like a frog say, out

00:44:16.481 --> 00:44:20.809
of this plastacene you give, you will start
that plasticine will start giving vibrations;

00:44:20.809 --> 00:44:25.661
It's most surprising. I have seen some 
children working with some clay, you see,

00:44:25.661 --> 00:44:29.063
some of these realized souls and they make
some funny shapes but immediately the

00:44:29.063 --> 00:44:32.407
vibrations start coming because they would
not tolerate anything that doesn't give

00:44:32.407 --> 00:44:35.606
them vibrations, so they'll remove a part,
they'll add up a part and shape it in such

00:44:35.606 --> 00:44:40.978
a way that it is aesthetic in sense. 
Spiritualism, so that is the second thing

00:44:40.978 --> 00:44:45.025
which gives us this enlightenment. I don't
know, whether I can cover seven of them

00:44:45.025 --> 00:44:50.708
but this is what it is. Now, this is a 
very important center in the navel,

00:44:50.708 --> 00:44:54.589
as we call it, the Nabhi Chakra. This one
is called Swadhishthan and this is a

00:44:54.589 --> 00:45:00.276
Nabhi chakra in the center, which manifests
our Solar Plexus. This manifests our
