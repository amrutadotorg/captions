00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.960
Good evening ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.960
Mataji is on the way and will be with you in short time.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.440
I thought it opportune

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.360
few minutes to run through by a recapitulation

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.600
the various aspects of the mechanism that lies within us

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.160
for those people who have come for the first time - excuse me -

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.640
many who might not have heard the earlier lecture in which

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.960
various aspects of the chakras and the two sides of the subtle body,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.840
the left and the right side and then the central channel

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.640
were discussed and explained.

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:49.640
And perhaps I can recapitulate a little on the

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.280
nature or quality of the chakra that

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.400
is expressed and the purpose

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.720
of Kundalini awakening and the process of Self-Realisation.

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.960
Many of you will be familiar with the

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.840
word "chakra" but for those who are not,

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.480
it's simply an energy center within us at a very subtle level

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.960
which expresses itself in the gross

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.800
as the plexuses of the autonomic nervous system.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.000
It expresses itself in seven plexuses.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.840
We have the Mooladhara chakra

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.560
which is part of that chakra

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.400
which we refer to as the Kundalini

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.040
and which lies in the gross body at the area

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.960
right at the tip of the sacrum bone, at the coccyx,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.800
and so it relates to the pelvic plexus, the sacral plexus,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.720
the coccygeal plexus and one other plexus that

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.120
is located in that area.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.600
So the Mooladhara chakra

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.920
is that center which controls our sex,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:16.000
it controls the whole organic structure

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.760
both muscular and [skeletonic] of that area

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.480
so controls such organs as the prostate gland

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.800
and in men and women of course the sex organs themselves

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:32.120
and so diseases that are related to this area

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.960
are very much a matter of

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.960
equipped investigating and fixing

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.960
damage which may have occured at the Mooladhara chakra.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.360
Also the psychosexual problems as well

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.160
could be very much affected and corrected

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.120
by Sahaja Yoga at this center.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.920
So Mooladhara chakra is the base,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.320
it is in fact the center which Mother has nominated

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.920
as Australia's part in the whole mechanism of this universe.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.640
At a very subtle level

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.720
countries play a part in the whole nature of evolution

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.960
and in a very incomprehensible way.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.560
But as you develop in Sahaja Yoga you begin to understand

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.080
Australia has a very vital role

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.600
as the root. Mooladhara means

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.400
the root, the root that on which everything stands.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.120
And so as you deepen in Sahaja Yoga you'll understand

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.840
what vital role we have to play.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.120
In fact India is that center which is in the sacrum bone

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.440
which is really a part of Mooladhara chakra

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.400
and it's the triangular bone in which the Kundalini sits.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:00.800
It's the center of purity, it's the center of holiness

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.960
it's the center in which the Kundalini itself resides

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.800
dormant and sleeping as the residual energy

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:12.760
which at an appropiate time in our evolution

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.480
spiritually has to rise.

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.720
So closely connected is the Mooladhara

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:21.920
and the Kundalini

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.280
and they are considered the first chakra.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:31.400
The quality as I said, of the Kundalini is purity and holiness.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.720
The quality of the Mooladhara chakra is innocence

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.440
and out of innocence comes wisdom

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.960
and with that wisdom comes obedience.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.840
All of these are qualities of the Mooladhara chakra,

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.440
which we find beginning to manifest

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.600
as this Kundalini energy begins to rise and purifies these centers.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.400
This is the center which gets so badly damaged by

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:03.160
all sorts of negative forces which due to our

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.200
licentious life due to all sorts of

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:11.160
rather bizarre attitude towards sex,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:15.080
all sorts of impure relationships,

00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:19.200
all sorts of the unholy relationships

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.200
which can and do damage that center.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.720
It's a center which is our chastity, both in men and women,

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.120
and if our chastity is assaulted,

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:35.000
then this center becomes quite badly damaged.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.160
It can be fixed, of course. This is the whole point that

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.840
Self-Realization, that each of these centers

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
can be managed in such a way that any damage can be neutralized

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.000
and in such a way that the spiritual ascent can be a growing,

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.960
tremendous force within each one of us.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.400
But the damage is there especially in the west.

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.840
Mother has often said that this center in Mooladhara

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.200
is the most damaged center in the west,

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:08.400
just as in India this center of Nabhi chakra

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.760
is the most damaged in the east.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.240
If I say to you that the Mooladhara

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:22.280
damage represents a sin against the Mother,

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:27.120
the holiness, the purity, then you might begin to understand.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.840
If I say that this center here,

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.280
where the damage has occurred in the east,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.720
is in a way a sin against the Father

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.400
the all protective Father, the Father that looks after everything,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.960
then when we see so much corruption

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.440
and so much graft and so much of this abuse in the east

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:50.920
we know that they must surely therefore doubt that

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:56.120
how the Father will in fact provide all that is necessary.

00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.360
So we've gone about damaging our Mooladhara chakra in the west

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.720
and of course people in the east, through their corrupt activities,

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.880
through their acquisitive attitudes,

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.720
through their materialistic obsessions

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.880
have damaged so badly this center

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.600
which is referred to as Nabhi chakra.

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.840
Getting back to the Mooladhara chakra you noticed

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.240
how is connected to the left hand channel which rises

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.760
as you probably read in some of the readings [today],

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:28.120
as the Ida nadi,

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:33.040
as the left hand side of the subtle body.

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:39.080
And it rises and it becomes what we call the superego.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.960
The next chakra of Swadisthan

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.360
is yellow, the yellow one. Just wait till Mother comes.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.680
So this Swadisthana chakra, as Mother has explained,

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.080
it's the creativity within us,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.080
it's the center which gives us our projections,

00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.200
it's the center which makes us capable of thinking

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:34.400
and rationalizing and working things out.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:40.360
It's also the source of the pure knowledge of the Divine.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:44.560
It's also the place where all pure knowledge,

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:49.960
all the pure conditionings take place and settle themselves

00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:53.600
in such a way that we become

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:56.560
ready for our spiritual ascent.

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.760
It's also the center which gets very badly damaged

00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.000
by impure knowledge and by too much thinking,

00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:06.120
and too much planning and too much analyzing and rationalizing.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.960
You notice how it's connected on the right hand side

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:12.680
by this yellow channel which

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:18.880
is called as Pingala nadi and terminates in this yellow balloon

00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:23.440
in the opposite side which constitutes our ego.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.720
This ego is our rational brain, it's the part of our being which

00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.720
thinks and mantains and analyzes.

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:36.840
It's also the side of our brain, if we like to put it that way,

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.760
which seeks power, ambition, wants to dominate

00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.120
and in its worst form, aggress others.

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:50.720
So in a way this two channels have been there for our use

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:54.600
in our spiritual ascent but in so many ways we often abused them

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.960
by misusing the left side

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.960
through too much emphasis on emotional life,

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.440
too much emphasis on worship without the connection,

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.280
too much emphasis on our conditioning,

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:09.040
too much emphasis on using spirits,

00:10:09.240 --> 00:10:12.760
all the things which we've talked about in the preceeding lectures.

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:16.960
Whereas on the right side we've damaged

00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.160
those aspects of the chakras to the right

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:24.240
which relate to our projections, our overthinking,

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:28.160
our rational thoughts, our dominating attitudes

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:29.920
and all of those things which have

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.080
created so many imbalances in the chakra.

00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.200
Because the chakra is a pure, vital center of energy,

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:42.880
intact and in its own way pure and untraveled.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:47.440
What we do to it by imbalances of either to the left or to the right

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:51.680
we cause a constriction of or even sometimes a detachment

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.640
of part of that center in such a way that

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:57.600
we can even end up with such diseases as cancer.

00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:00.800
Cancer is in fact a complete

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:06.680
brake down, a construction which is lead to a separation

00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:10.200
of one aspect of the center, which in term causes

00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.040
a separation in the cellular structure of the body

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:15.480
and of course run away cancer.

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:21.200
Is the uncollective, if you like,  expression of that damage.

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:25.080
Then we have the Nabhi chakra which is the centre, as I told you,

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.720
which is often quite badly damaged in the east

00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:30.720
as much as the Mooladhara chakra

00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.720
is the one which we damage in the west

00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:36.360
so too the Nabhi chakra is the one which due to

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.720
too much emphasis on money, too much graft and corruption,

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:45.480
too much doubting that God the Father who look after us

00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:48.840
and provide for us in every way

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.960
and so therefore damaging this center.

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.200
This is the problem of the Nabhi chakra.

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.040
But the essence of the Nabhi chakra relates to our evolution

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.960
it relates to the principle of the family life,

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.960
it relates to the means by which we evolve in other words.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.800
Family structure is an integral part to the evolution

00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:14.680
and so if Mother appeared to emphasize family life last evening,

00:12:14.880 --> 00:12:17.720
if She appeared to emphasize motherhood,

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.000
if She appered to emphasis the quality of love within motherhood,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.320
not child bearing but motherhood,

00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:27.200
then understand what She is saying -

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:30.560
we have to evolve to higher beings.

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:34.280
When we move from the human stage,

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.080
when we move from the animal stage into the human stage

00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:41.080
we knew that we had to move higher and higher.

00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.800
Now we've reached that epitome of evolution as a human being

00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.400
and we have to now reach the higher levels going further

00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:51.320
of becoming a spiritual being.

00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.600
Now if She is here to do the job,

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:59.600
if She is here to takes us through that next stage in our evolution

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.800
just keep yourself in that frame of mind where

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.720
it's a spontaneous happening that has to take place.

00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.240
It's the terminal point, if you like, in the principle of evolution

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.240
as epitomized by this center here.

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:15.120
And so if She speaks forcefully

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.760
about the qualities of a loving mother,

00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:22.760
if She speaks strongly about the nature of family life

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.040
and how it is broken down in the west

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.120
and if She openly admits that some aspects of Indian way of life

00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:33.200
are not quite right,

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.240
but predominantly there are many areas which are

00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:41.200
tremedously important and could be well emulated in our country

00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:45.480
please understand She is not supporting

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.720
just in a nationalistic way the Indian way of life,

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:52.680
She is supporting those eternal qualities of evolution

00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.800
which thank God had been retained in that country which is still,

00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:01.760
potentially and in reality, the greatest spiritual country

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:05.480
that's now in existence in this world.

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:08.720
So this center is the center of our evolution

00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:12.640
and it epitomizes the quality of joy through family life,

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:17.200
of satisfaction. It relates to our material wellbeing.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:19.880
So if we don't have a good Nabhi chakra

00:14:20.040 --> 00:14:22.240
quite often we'll have problems with money.

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:24.960
Or the other way around if we have problems with money

00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:28.640
or are constantly obsessed about material things,

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:32.880
so too we will have a very damaged Nabhi chakra.

00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.760
And of course all the organs that relate to this centers

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.280
have to be taken into account.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.120
If you are suffering diseases

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.480
of the organs of say the stomach, the liver,

00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.160
the spleen, the pancreas, the kidneys all of these areas,

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.760
it is either relating to the Nabhi chakra or the Swadisthana chakra.

00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:55.720
And then the heart chakra in a word is the center of security,

00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:57.880
the security within us.

00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.280
In the center it's that center of security

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:05.880
of knowing with certitude that Almighty God,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.800
through the quality of the Mother of the universe, Jagadamba,

00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:15.240
that She will provide that nothing can assail you,

00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:19.400
nothing can bring you down, that you become fearless,

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:24.800
that no matter whether you are a king or whether you are a beggar,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:29.160
that nothing, nothing can assail you,

00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.880
nothing can break the confidence that you are a human being

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.600
and that the Mother of the universe is looking after you.

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:40.160
That's the quality of the center heart, the sacred heart.

00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:42.800
Then we have the left heart which relates to

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.640
the quality of motherhood,

00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:50.280
that security again which a baby must feel in the womb,

00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:53.200
which a child feels in the arms of the mother.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:57.360
It's the quality of security, of that caliber.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:01.760
And so if there's a dis-relationship between the mother

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.360
and those other members of the family

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.680
or you and your attitude towards your mother is not harmonious,

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:12.680
then this left heart center will be in trouble.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:17.400
And so too on the right hand side is the center of the father.

00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.080
the father is the protector, the father is the one who takes care

00:16:22.280 --> 00:16:27.840
in a very firm, forthright way, as epitomized by Shri Rama.

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.400
The great incarnation of Vishnu who came on the earth to show

00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:36.600
just how important it is to have that quality of fatherhood.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:40.880
Responsibility to the society, responsibility to the family,

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.200
responsibilty to his wife and to his children.

00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:47.800
And so this is the center in which the father becomes

00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.720
that secure example within us

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:56.480
wherein we feel and those around us feel

00:16:56.720 --> 00:17:01.760
that absolutely nothing can assail us, because we epitomize

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.280
that quality of fatherhood which gives that security.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.320
And so diseases related to the lungs, the heart

00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:14.640
and many other subtler, smaller organs in that area

00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.840
are related to this center.

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.400
Then we have Vishudhi chakra about which Mataji spoke last night.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.640
This is the center of the throat.

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:26.400
This is the center of Shri Krishna,

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.280
the next incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:33.040
And His incarnation was that of

00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.960
showing us that we are part of the whole,

00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.920
showing us that there is an All-pervading God,

00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:45.560
showing us that we have to realize the Akbar, the Great.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:48.680
Allah hu Akbar. God is great.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:52.600
And we have to know with certitude that this All-Pervading God

00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:58.080
is the one who gives us that spiritual ascent.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.840
We have to have self-esteem, neither loving ourselves too much

00:18:01.960 --> 00:18:04.080
nor loving ourselves too little.

00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:06.360
And so it's the center of self-esteem.

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.960
On the one side if we are feeling guilty

00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.120
or if we are feeling the desire

00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:15.600
to constantly allow others to aggress us and to dominate us

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.960
we'll have problems on the left hand side.

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.680
If we are in fact loving ourselves too much

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.680
and not reflecting the Akbar,

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:28.040
if we are loving ourselves too much then we aggress others,

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:31.960
we become dominating, we use our language badly,

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.960
we are often very, very sharp with our tongue and very hot tempered.

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.040
This gives us problems on the right Vishuddhi and this may manifest

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:44.040
in most of you as stresses and tensions of the neck muscles,

00:18:44.240 --> 00:18:46.760
it may relate to thyroid problems,

00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:50.360
it may relate to coughs and colds in the throat and the bronchitis

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.840
and so it goes on. I need not to go far.

00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.960
Then finally, not finally but second, last chakra

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.920
is the Agnya chakra which is known

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:03.640
possibly to many of you as the third eye.

00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:07.080
This is in fact the center of the lord Jesus Christ.

00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.360
It's the holiest of holy center

00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.840
that it was opened two thousand years ago

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:16.240
by the lord Jesus Christ and His Mother Mary.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:20.400
It's a center which establishes within our brain,

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:25.800
within our enlightened awareness the principle of Spirit.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:29.600
It's the center which exemplifies

00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:32.760
the purpose of Christ's incarnation

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:37.640
that not only that we had to crucify this ego,

00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:42.000
which was so prevalent, but that the Spirit had to ascent,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.200
that we are not this physical body, we are the Spirit.

00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:51.440
And in order to achieve this we have to be forgiveness.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:54.960
We have to be forgiveness first to ourselves

00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.440
and to everyone around us.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.640
This was the message of the lord Jesus Christ and His ascent

00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:06.840
in the sense of His resurrection is the message at the Agnya chakra.

00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.160
And so as the Kundalini passes through all these centers

00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:13.200
and comes to Agnya chakra,

00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:16.640
what actually happens is that these two

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:20.960
useful devices, up to this point,

00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:25.440
these two useful balloons called ego and superego,

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:29.400
actually become absorbed, they become sucked in

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:34.720
at the time when the Kundalini rises and enlightens this center.

00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.320
The egos are karmas

00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:40.760
and the superego all of those sins so called

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.960
that we've committed in the past, all get sucked in

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.880
and so the message of Christ

00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:48.240
that He died for our sins becomes a reality.

00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:53.000
But until the Kundalini rises and passes this center,

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:56.240
this sucking in process cannot happen.

00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:59.360
What Christ said cannot become an actualization

00:20:59.600 --> 00:21:01.640
until you get your Realization,

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.280
until the spiritual ascent takes place.

00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:09.280
So it's fundamental that this energy of the Holy Spirit within us,

00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:11.960
this Kundalini should rise,

00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.600
enlighten the centers and give us our second birth.

00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:18.080
And where is the second birth take place?

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:21.840
It takes place at the Sahasrara.

00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:25.360
So many times we've read of

00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:29.720
so many things which relate to the top of the head.

00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:32.880
So often we've puzzled ourselves over the nature

00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:36.760
of this fontanel bone in a baby which pulsates

00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.920
and which closes at the age of twelve and becomes calcified.

00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:44.640
Thoughtful people who pondered on this - why is it calcified ?

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.160
What's the subtle reason for this?

00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:52.080
And in what way does it disconnect us from the Divine?

00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:54.880
The way in which we were born as a child.

00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:58.480
This is the center which has been opened

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:02.680
in this era, in ths age, in your lifetime by Shri Mataji.

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.920
This is the center which had to come.

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.160
This is the center where the Spirit makes its final ascent

00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.960
and put you in touch with

00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:15.720
and you become part of the All-Pervading God.

00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:17.800
And so when this center opens

00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.640
you get the connection with the Divine.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.720
What Christ said about being born again becomes an actualization.

00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:30.640
It's not a self-certification, it's an actual experience

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.040
in which you begin to feel this energy

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.600
which is dormant and that is sacrum,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:37.960
manifesting at the top of the head.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:41.080
You feel it as a cool wind emitting from the top of the head and

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:43.760
as if blowing upwards onto the palm of the hand.

00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.760
And you begin to feel it blowing onto the hands.

00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.440
You feel it in fact as a fountain of energy

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:53.680
which flows down over your body and you enjoy the bliss.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:58.120
At first you may feel heat, you may not feel that bliss or joy

00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.360
but increasingly as the Kundalini rises

00:23:00.600 --> 00:23:04.160
and you develop your Realization you begin to know the Brahma,

00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:08.200
you begin to know the energy of God.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:10.720
You become all of those things

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:14.880
which all the great incarnations said you had to become.

00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:16.720
You become the Spirit.

00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:21.120
And so if Mother is the One who can do the job

00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:24.840
we shouldn't be too circumspect about it.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.800
If She is the one who can raise the kundalini in thousands

00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:33.960
and can convince a rather skeptical person like myself -

00:23:34.200 --> 00:23:36.840
when I first got my Realization,

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.960
not by intellectual or rational reasoning

00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:42.840
but by the simple joy on the faces of the people

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.160
who gave Me the Realization,

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:48.880
by seeing the transformation in their life,

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:52.480
by watching physical diseases disappear

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:57.240
in a relatively short time, quite often instantly.

00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:03.200
I humble myself down and I say, "Perhaps She is this,

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.880
perhaps She is this, perhaps we are in the myths

00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.360
at a time in our evolution when

00:24:10.600 --> 00:24:13.720
a great incarnation is here on the earth.

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:18.120
Perhaps there are forces which very naturally at that time,

00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:20.600
come to delude us and to mislead us

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:23.640
and I have to be careful about but [more than everything]

00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:29.560
I have to be a little bit logic when say, "what if She is?"

00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.960
So many people might

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:34.920
go away from a meeting like this and say

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:38.040
"Perhaps this is blasphemy".

00:24:38.240 --> 00:24:42.360
Of course you are free to make up your mind but I urge you

00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:45.040
to ask the question in your heart,

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:49.280
ask the question on the Kundalini, because you have that power.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.880
You can put your hands up to Her

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.160
and if it's emitting those cool vibrations

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:56.600
then that cool vibration

00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.080
is the flow of the energy of Almighty God which is telling you

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.680
that before you is sitting Truth.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.200
You have to reach a logical conclusion but more than that

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.480
you have to experience something

00:25:11.720 --> 00:25:14.800
which settles your mind at rest and says

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.640
"I have achieved the ultimate".

00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:21.960
If Shri Mataji is the incarnation of the Holy Spirit,

00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.280
and so many thousands of people around the world

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.200
now recognize that She is,

00:25:27.400 --> 00:25:30.600
then is it right that we keep it in the dark?

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.160
Is it right that we don't announce it?

00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.920
Is it right that perhaps in five years time when

00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:42.960
so many people have reached that level of suffering

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:48.960
and confusion that it's almost an impossible task to retrace,

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.600
is it right that we withdraw and hold back and don't tell you?

00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.800
In fact many of you who are so critical,

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:59.360
not in this audience but around the world,

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:02.920
will say "Why didn't you tell us? Why didn't you tell us?

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:06.760
If only you've told us we at least could have

00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.040
made our own mind up and satisfied ourselves."

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:13.920
So if we declare

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.960
and utter

00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:21.200
the very, very clear statement that Shri Mataji

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:27.040
is in our opinion the incarnation of the Holy Spirit,

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:29.600
see it through both sides.

00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.960
If you want take it as a hypothesis.

00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.280
If you feel the vibrations and are secure in that knowledge

00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:40.600
that knowing who Mother is in your heart, enjoy it.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.600
But [either] way whether you remain open as a scientist

00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:46.880
keep it as a hypothesis,

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.080
or you feel Mother in your heart and you enjoy

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:53.640
the beginning of your final spiritual ascent,

00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.560
whatever it is, don't be too hasty.

00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:04.400
Don't judge, because it can [unclear] you

00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.360
somebody who has never quite achieved

00:27:07.600 --> 00:27:13.040
the final, the ultimate, that they wanted to achieve.

00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:21.920
We often wonder how to speak to people too,

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.680
to arrive at logical conclusions.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.240
It's always a difiicult thing, I think you must understand.

00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:30.480
If Mataji is this being?

00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:33.840
How to put it in such a way that

00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:36.200
A who reached those logical conclusions

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:41.360
and B to don't allow the intellect to be, create such a barier

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:46.320
that it prevents you from the spiritual ascent?

00:27:46.600 --> 00:27:48.800
Christ has said as well, you know,

00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.440
that "I will send you a Counselor, a Comforter,

00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:54.680
the Holy Spirit who will teach you all things."

00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:56.560
If Mother is that,

00:27:56.760 --> 00:27:59.280
what is She doing when She is teaching you all things?

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:01.960
What is She doing  when She is comforting you by

00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:05.000
purifying these centers and by advising you

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:08.320
and couselling you so sweetly?

00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.280
If She is the energy of the Holy Spirit,

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:15.560
God's manifestation, the power of God Almighty

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.280
then allow it to take place.

00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:21.080
These things have been predicted so often

00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:24.920
in Scriptures, which possibly many of us haven't read.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:28.400
I 've now seen them, so many people have seen them around the world.

00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:30.320
The Markandeya Purana,

00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:36.080
in which is clearly stated that Adi Shakti had to take birth...

00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:39.080
Yes, Mataji has asked me to introduce this in this way.

00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.280
Yes, because you see, there is a little problem, all right?

00:28:42.480 --> 00:28:47.040
I'll speak, I'll speak to you, I'll meet you all. May God bless you.

00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.240
Have patience. Little bit he has to talk. It's important. All right?

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:57.280
The Markandeya Purana has clearly said Adi Shakti has to take birth.

00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:01.960
So many Hindus who know this. Mohammed spoke of the Mehdi.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:06.400
[unclear] for those who speak out of it.

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.960
There have been predictions,

00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:12.200
there have been predictions which clearly said

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:15.680
and even to the point which the date was given

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.400
whether it's [unclear] people,

00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.360
such as Jeane Dixon, or the real seers

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.120
such as happened two and three and five thousand years ago,

00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.800
in which it was said that

00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:33.760
at this time, at this very time

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.600
there would be a great Mahayogi

00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:40.480
as it was said, who would take birth,

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:43.680
to lead people out of this confusion

00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:46.280
and to give them Self Realization,

00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.480
so that they in fact today will know their own master.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.960
so that they could heal their own bodies,

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:54.160
so that you could close the hospitals.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:57.160
All these things have been said in the Scriptures.

00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:01.760
The Devi Bhagavatam, the Markandeya Purana.

00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:05.240
Such great writers like Adi Shankaracharia said,

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:08.160
"Only by the grace of the Mother

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.080
can Self Realization be attained".

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.280
In other words even gurus themselves

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.760
have received the Self Realization at the Feet of the Holy Mother.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:24.560
This is something which even in conventional catholicism although

00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:29.560
unfortunately so much of conventional catholicism

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:35.200
is considered now to be rather,

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.400
I don`t know quite what word to use. But

00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:40.880
rightful attitude within the church,

00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.640
that so many Catholics believe,

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.800
strongly in the role of the Mother, the role of the Virgin Mary

00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:51.600
and Her importance in the whole of life`s Christ.

00:30:51.800 --> 00:30:53.680
It`s clearly been said but

00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:57.480
as Mother has said Christ could not say very much at that time.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.920
So I want you just to

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.280
think about this a little, but

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:07.680
when you reach the conclusion that perhaps She may be It,

00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:12.440
perhaps, She may be It, give yourself a chance.

00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:16.040
So many people are offended by

00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:20.280
a direct state. It challenges the ego too much.

00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:22.680
And when that happens,

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.720
what occurs is that a big barrier has placed across, at this point

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:31.400
and your Kundalini cannot rise. You cannot experience it.

00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:36.440
So what you should do is desire from your heart

00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:40.600
that "Mother, please give me my Realization."

00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:46.160
Say it humbly, ask for it, and if it occurs

00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:50.240
let it grow as an experience and as it grows

00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.760
you can then find out the truth for yourself, in a very precise way

00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:59.400
using the vibratory awareness which Mother will teach us.

00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:03.640
At the session on Sunday, when we come

00:32:03.840 --> 00:32:06.360
we will show you how to use the vibratory awareness,

00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.960
how to balance up taking balances on the two sides.

00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:16.120
But for now get the experience established.

00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:21.680
Don't fall into the trap which so many of us are falling into

00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:24.840
of creating a barrier at this point which prevents us

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:30.560
from even achieving the state of Self-Realization.

00:32:30.760 --> 00:32:35.360
It`s the love of God, it's the energy of the Almighty God.

00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:40.600
It's the pure bliss, it's the consciousness and it's the truth.

00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.280
And you have to achieve it.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.600
All the scriptures have said it so if

00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:51.280
you have to achieve it, and if Mother can do the job,

00:32:51.480 --> 00:32:56.200
just enjoy it and allow to become a spontaneous happening

00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.760
in your own awareness and know it consciously

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:02.200
so that with your eyes closed

00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.480
you begin to feel this vibration in the hand.

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:09.760
We switch the air conditioning off at the end of program as we know

00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:11.280
so that you can really

00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:15.640
tell your brain to go to sleep for a little while and just feel it.

00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.440
This is what it is.

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:21.600
Ladies and gentlemen, sorry to take it so long but

00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.200
I just wanted to

00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:28.240
invite you to be a little more open,

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:33.120
because we will be the ones that are to play.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.360
If we didn't tell you who Mother was, and you walked away from it,

00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:40.200
if you are a genuine seeker. So we have to say it to you.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:45.920
Ladies and gentlemen, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi!

00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.960
To all the seekers of truth I bow.

00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:08.040
I must say Dr. Warren has done a good job.

00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:17.160
Perhaps you don't understand that the situation is quite

00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:24.720
different in the western countries.

00:34:24.920 --> 00:34:30.120
I don't have to have any introduction in India,

00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:34.440
nor anybody has to give any apologies all the time, you see,

00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:37.000
trying to convince getting this,

00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:42.080
that into the whole argument

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.960
to prove that I'm the truth and that I'm genuine,

00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:50.640
that there is no hanky panky about Me.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.160
It's very embarrassing for Me to say it.

00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:58.480
And the background is like this, when I came to Australia this time

00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:02.600
from all over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis who are in the west -

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.840
we have many in every country -

00:35:05.080 --> 00:35:06.240
and they have wrote that

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:09.720
"this time Mother must say who She is, is important.

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:12.120
Because the questions like this, "Then how can You do it?

00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:14.840
How can it be easy? Are You the one who is doing?

00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.880
All kinds of questions come in.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:21.080
And I just told them, "Please don't do it. It's not easy

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.760
for a western mind to accept it". You see, they'll all come on you.

00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:29.240
And yesterday also I told you the same thing.

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:35.680
And it was accepted by many people

00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.640
because they felt the cool breeze.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.840
They did feel the cool breeze coming out of their heads

00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.480
but some did not.

00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:45.640
And because they did not feel it, they challenged

00:35:45.840 --> 00:35:50.120
and they were angry about it

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.640
Now, the position is like this

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.200
that so far if your mind has been guiding you properly

00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:02.200
there was no need for Me to say anything.

00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:08.840
We are living in the atmosphere of great confusion.

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:11.680
Tremendous confusion exists.

00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:14.760
We don't know what is good what is bad.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:20.480
Some people say that it's better to have an unmarried life.

00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:23.240
Some say it's better to have the married life,

00:36:23.440 --> 00:36:26.000
some say it's better to keep the children out in the school,

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.840
some say it is not.

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.960
The governments don't understand whether communism is all right

00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:33.960
or capitalism is all right. Economics is dwindling.

00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:36.200
They don't understand what is happening.

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:41.520
So the result of all our enterprises is very confusing.

00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:45.760
And we don't understand really what is right and what is wrong.

00:36:45.960 --> 00:36:50.680
So we use whatever we think right, as the right.

00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.840
But whatever we think as right,

00:36:54.040 --> 00:36:58.880
is it coming from something absolute or from relative,

00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:01.800
because we are conditioned people?

00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:04.560
For a lady who, say, comes from a catholic church

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:08.240
she wouldn't like Me to tell her that

00:37:08.440 --> 00:37:12.480
I am the Comforter or I am the Holy Ghost. She won't like it.

00:37:12.720 --> 00:37:14.920
But I would ask her one question:

00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:18.800
supposing if I am how will she recognize Me?

00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.280
If supposing tomorrow Christ comes here

00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:26.160
how would she recognize Christ? It's a very apologetic, you see,

00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.080
low based type, which really I didn't want to start it,

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:32.200
because it takes you down to such a level

00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.520
that you just don't want to talk about it.

00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:36.640
But it happens with the western people.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:41.040
You have to stoop down too low to convince them who you are.

00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.280
Of course you are not going to crucify Me, I know,

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:47.240
but you'll crucify yourself if you don't accept it that's the point.

00:37:47.480 --> 00:37:50.360
Because I have a concern,

00:37:50.600 --> 00:37:52.640
I have to do this job

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:56.240
and I have to do it with great care that

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.640
you are very great seekers

00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:01.680
you have been seeking truth for ages now

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.160
and the time has come for you to get it.

00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:07.360
And this is the time your western ego stands up and says that

00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:10.480
"How can that be? Why it is You? You see.

00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:12.760
So I said, "All right, you do it, I don't mind.

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.720
if you can do it I do nothing.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:18.560
The problem is this ego is such a

00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:21.720
thing that we are never aware of it

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.880
we are never aware that it's a ego that is working it out.

00:38:25.080 --> 00:38:28.680
Like Hitler. When he destroyed people,

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:33.600
he was never aware that he was doing it just to satisfy his ego.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.880
He thought that what he was doing was right.

00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:40.680
And all of them who do such things always believe that it is right.

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.120
So this is a problem. And then the question comes in that

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.200
"Mother you might be also doing it out of ego".

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:48.720
Possibly. One can say. That could be so.

00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:53.360
But what is my gain out of that ego, is nothing.

00:38:53.960 --> 00:38:56.720
As it is you know I'm a very happily married,

00:38:56.920 --> 00:38:59.600
woman of a very rich family,

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:05.240
I don't need anything from you, I am in a very great position.

00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.480
But why am I concerned is the point.

00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:11.160
Now put your mind on this position,

00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:13.960
"that just now we do not ask any questions".

00:39:14.200 --> 00:39:17.120
"Let's have it first of all, let have our Spirit.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:19.440
If She is saying "I'm going to give you the Spirit"

00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:22.200
all right, have it. No harm.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:25.320
Afterall I have done no harm to anyone so far.

00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.960
There's none who can say

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.560
that I have harmed anyone or somebody has lost.

00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:33.480
Today with me there was a little child with a limbed hand.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.400
The child could never have been cured

00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:37.440
through medicine as it is, could never have.

00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.840
All the life the child would have had the limb like that.

00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:42.520
But within ten minutes with Sahaja Yoga the child was cured.

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:44.920
It's a fact, I'm telling you the truth.

00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:48.760
But that doesn't mean that you should believe Me.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.760
But by believing Me you are not the loser.

00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:53.840
On the contrary it is just the other way round.

00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.280
The whole situation is the other way round thing.

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.200
It's like the river Ganges is flowing

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:02.280
and you have to fill your pitchers.

00:40:02.520 --> 00:40:06.320
Now, they don't expect Me to fall at your feet.

00:40:06.520 --> 00:40:11.000
"All right, you take your Realization". It's too much.

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:16.480
But I've done one thing, that the way other incarnations

00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:20.720
came and talked - human beings are not easy people,

00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.760
they are really complicated,

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.800
full of their ego. They live with their ego,

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:28.040
morning till evening they float within their ego.

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.320
So they are not going to accept anything

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:33.400
unless and until somehow you bring it down

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:36.280
to a point where they receive their Realization.

00:40:36.480 --> 00:40:38.760
This is exactly My father told me

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:41.160
that "You have such and such vision, You have to do it.

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.800
But don't write about it and don't talk about it

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.600
till you have found out an en masse method

00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.640
by which you can give en masse Realization. This is My job

00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:52.600
for which I have come on this earth.

00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.760
And he told Me that "If you write a book,

00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.440
it will become another Bible.

00:40:56.680 --> 00:40:59.360
If you say anything it will become another saying

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.560
and people will just use it to pamper their ego".

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.640
And they have crucified all the people like this.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:09.000
Now while in India you see people understand

00:41:09.200 --> 00:41:11.840
because they are educated as I told you.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:12.960
There's this book

00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:17.200
which is a prediction written by Brighmuni who is the,

00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:21.480
I should say the originator of astrology in India,

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:22.640
thousands of years back.

00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:25.440
And he wrote a book called Nadi Granth,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.960
which was the original book he wrote, in which

00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:30.520
he has mentioned about these things happening.

00:41:30.760 --> 00:41:32.960
Was revised 300 years back

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.840
and was said that in 1970 this work will start by someone

00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:39.960
and I started my work in 1970.

00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:44.520
Because you do not know, it is so describing details

00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:47.880
how to recognize the Holy Ghost.

00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:50.200
Christians don't know much about Holy Ghost at all.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.240
I would say that they don't want to know also.

00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:54.560
They have never read any other book

00:41:54.800 --> 00:41:56.400
to know what is the Holy Ghost is.

00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.200
But there are all the descriptions in details given

00:42:00.440 --> 00:42:03.560
as to how to recognize the Holy Ghost.

00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:05.800
But I must admit that this work

00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:09.240
I have never done before of giving en masse Realization.

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.400
This is the first time I have been able

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:16.680
successfully to do this job which I have to work out.

00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:19.600
It's a great penance I have to go through

00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:23.640
by which I learned

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:25.240
what problems human beings have,

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.840
their permutations, combinations, everything.

00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.000
And they are so many that now you see you have seven chakras.

00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.240
Seven chakras and three gunas so tewnty one.

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:40.120
Then raised to power, say all these centres

00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:43.280
have got different, different number of petals

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.280
raised to power all these

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:47.640
you have permutations and combinations

00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:52.080
so you can imagine how many permutations and combinations you have.

00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.720
So first you have to be brought to the basic points,

00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:57.320
you see, where the problem is, to the basics,

00:42:57.520 --> 00:43:01.280
and then to realize what can one do

00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.200
to take the Kundalini

00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.280
out, here,

00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:12.760
by which method one can do it. It's a technique.

00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:15.240
It's the technique of the divine laws you see.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:19.840
This is too subtle a work within us but the movement

00:43:20.080 --> 00:43:22.600
of the Kundalini stops at the first point

00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:25.840
or at the second point or at the third point.

00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:29.880
Now what is the method by which you can raise it, you see?

00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:32.920
Now this I had to first find out what's the problem

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:36.760
with the human beings are. So I did not only study human beings

00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.960
but I also went to all these horrible bhoots

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:42.800
to find out what they are doing to you,

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:45.520
how they are. Very close I went to find out

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:47.920
how they are spoiling your chakras.

00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:49.840
Then the drugs I studied with some people

00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:53.400
who had taken drugs and all that, what is going wrong with them,

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.760
what is spoiling them.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.040
Then there are people who had problems, physical problems.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.200
To study the physical problem was very easy for Me

00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:05.040
because I know what is this physical body is,

00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:08.960
but I did not know what you say it in the medical terminology

00:44:09.200 --> 00:44:12.160
because these are your words not of God.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.720
So I studied medicine for that. Then the psychologists,

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:17.280
I thought the psychologists are creating another problem.

00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:19.720
They are not understanding what they have to say.

00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:25.520
Except for you, I would say the rest of them were half baked.

00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:28.040
something wrong with them. So then I realized

00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:32.320
that they are treating people who are pathologically

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:35.240
upset or who are pathological cases.

00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.560
And they do not know how to protect themselves

00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.720
from these pathological things you see,

00:44:39.960 --> 00:44:42.200
and they just handle the situation as they have.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:47.040
It's like putting your hand into the hole of a snake, you see

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.760
And then they are getting a bite and because of that you see

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:54.360
they become exactly the same what their patients are.

00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:56.600
And then they start universalizing

00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:01.040
that particular pathological problem to the whole world.

00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.480
That a person, they meet a man who is a pervert,

00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.400
say for example himself Freud was a perverted man

00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:08.320
He had relations with his mother.

00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.040
So first he must have met somebody.

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.720
I give him all the chance you see.

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:13.720
Maybe he is born like that I don't know

00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:17.720
but he must have met someone whose mother

00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:20.640
must have had bad relation or something like that

00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:22.320
and he must have treated this fellow.

00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.800
By treating him he must have got that upon himself.

00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.200
Now he made it an universal

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:30.360
truth for everyone that everybody has this within them.

00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:32.040
It's absolutely wrong.

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.160
It's an absolutely wrong staff.

00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:36.120
I mean in India if you tell anybody

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:38.480
they'll laugh "God, we have nothing to do".

00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.720
There was a gentleman, Freud fellow, he came

00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.400
and started criticizing, something he wrote, an article,

00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:46.280
and people wrote him back answer saying that “Now you the Freudian,

00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:48.800
you go back to England. You are not wanted here”.

00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:50.200
He's an Indian but they said,

00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:53.200
“We don't want you here.We understand all these things better."

00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:58.280
Because traditionally Indian mind has understood so many things,

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:00.800
and this trial and error method that we know

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:04.480
that this is all nonsense people are talking.

00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:10.280
But because you people are naive and great seekers,

00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.920
moreover there is also ego problem,

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:15.600
I have to balance it somehow and that's why

00:46:15.800 --> 00:46:18.360
today, because I told Dr. Warren that I had told you

00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:20.840
that I don't want to tell these people and you were the people

00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:24.360
who telephoned to Me and called to Me that “Mother should be clear”,

00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:27.560
and we did it and there is an opposition. So now you pay for it.

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:31.760
And that's why he wanted to make an apology for everything.

00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:36.120
There's nothing to be apologetic. There's nothing to be apologetic.

00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:40.560
It is for you to receive it.  Is the, position is very different.

00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:46.440
It is you who have to ask for it. It's My...

00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:49.640
No gain for Me. I have nothing to gain from you.

00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:53.160
I have to give you something. And when I have to give you something

00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:57.760
then you have to get it yourself and not to doubt another.

00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.440
What will you get by doubting?

00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.720
What are you going to get out of it?

00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:05.920
So first of all to put down your mind in proper shape

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:09.760
because it was too much of a shock yesterday to many people.

00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:14.120
[Best done] there are people who said that "All right,

00:47:14.320 --> 00:47:17.800
today let Warren talk about these things and pacify them", you see.

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:22.040
It's like pacifying a son-in-law who is angry.

00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.480
All right, so this has worked out. I hope you people understand

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:30.760
that there is no need to feel disturbed.

00:47:31.040 --> 00:47:33.440
We have to get our Realization.

00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:38.280
On the contrary if you do not get it you must worry about it.

00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:40.480
That's not a good thing.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.480
You must all get your Realization.

00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:46.960
Now this is the seventh chakra we were talking about.

00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:50.800
Seventh chakra is the chakra where the limbic area

00:47:51.040 --> 00:47:54.160
in the brain, you see the limbic area is there.

00:47:54.360 --> 00:47:58.560
This limbic area is covered with all the seven chakras.

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:01.120
For example if you start from here

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:04.440
from the back where the protrusion is there,

00:48:04.680 --> 00:48:08.920
is the Mooladhara chakra which is down here.

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:15.080
So when you people have problems with sex,

00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:20.040
say, a person who has led a perverted sex life,

00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:23.920
gradually, this chakra gets influenced

00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:29.600
and a person becomes mentally soft, as you can say.

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:33.360
He starts getting you see hallucinations and

00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:37.320
sometimes he loses his balance also.

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.120
[Descend] because the effect is on the brain.

00:48:40.320 --> 00:48:43.160
So I'm just trying to explain to you these seven chakras

00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:47.400
around the limbic area which is the Sahasrara,

00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:51.880
the last chakra, and how it affects.

00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:55.440
So now the second chakra is Swadisthana

00:48:55.640 --> 00:48:59.160
which is round that Mooladhara, here at the back.

00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:03.040
Now Swadisthana is the chakra

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:07.680
which as he said on the gross

00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:13.400
looks after your liver, kidney, spleen, pancreas

00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:17.360
and your uterus, on the gross, on the physical level.

00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:22.600
Also is responsible for

00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:27.200
giving you more creativity

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:31.680
future thinking and also can be damaged

00:49:31.880 --> 00:49:33.840
if you do, overdo that

00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:37.200
or if you try to take to something

00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:40.800
that is unauthorized as God is concerned.

00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.240
So it affects both ways.

00:49:43.440 --> 00:49:46.720
Now when this happens what are the problems, let's say.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:51.760
First problem comes in that when you

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.640
the central portion is out of gear

00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.440
this center shows results on the brain here.

00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.040
And the effect on the brain is that,

00:50:01.240 --> 00:50:03.240
first supposing you are suffering from diabetes

00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:07.280
- take one example of diabetes - your eyes will be affected.

00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:11.080
You have seen diabetic people go on losing their eyesight gradually.

00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:15.960
And they become big because it is on the optic lobe

00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:19.560
sitting here and controls the optic lobe.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:22.320
So when you get diabetic

00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.320
that oppression of this centre

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:31.840
or you can say the lethargy

00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:33.880
of this center,

00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:36.280
makes your eyes week gradually

00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:42.000
because there is something wrong in the void.

00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.080
something wrong with the  Swadishtana chakra.

00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.560
I will tell you in short, because seven chakras we have today.

00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:52.360
So now the higher chakra than that is the Nabhi chakra.

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:57.720
Nabhi chakra is left and right on your head here at the back, here.

00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:04.000
Now this is the centre of, as he said, of your seeking.

00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:09.120
and you are seeking money

00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:14.320
or you are seeking power or you are seeking love,

00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:19.320
all these things get indicated in this part of your head.

00:51:19.560 --> 00:51:23.000
And that's how the Nabhi chakra gets caught.

00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:28.400
Now you can see when the Kundalini rises, also in the brain.

00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:31.840
You can find out what chakra is catching because that is the portion

00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:36.040
if you put your hand you'll find is still, still very hot.

00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:41.440
The chakras which are all right, that portion in this line,

00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.640
where the, all the centers are placed is soft.

00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:49.240
But where the chakras are wrong you can see it there.

00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:53.080
Now this is tallied also that you feel, on the left hand,

00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:56.440
this is the Nabhi chakra's finger or the right hand.

00:51:56.680 --> 00:51:58.760
Some sort of a sensation of burning, maybe numbness

00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:02.600
or whatever it is to show that these chakras are out.

00:52:02.800 --> 00:52:05.560
Also you can see that the Kundalini is rising

00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:07.680
that the Kundalini has stopped there

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:09.720
and She is moving here and there

00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:11.480
and you see the pulsation like that.

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:16.040
So it's all tallied up. You can see for yourself clearly.

00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:20.440
So this is the Nabhi chakra which is very important

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:25.920
because it is your seeking. So it has to be put in balance.

00:52:26.160 --> 00:52:31.280
After that comes the higher chakra, called the heart.

00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:33.720
Is a very important chakra.

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.200
Because this chakra is placed in the center here.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:42.360
This is actually is the fontanel bone area just in the center, here.

00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:45.240
Now the pulsation of the Kundalini

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:48.720
is felt here first when She has not pierced through.

00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:52.640
But when She pierces then you start feeling actually

00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:54.840
the cool breeze coming out of that portion.

00:52:55.080 --> 00:52:58.600
But in the beginning maybe due to the little friction

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.640
between the Kundalini and this portion of the head

00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:04.360
maybe you might feel hot or because of other things also

00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:05.840
inside the chakras.

00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:09.760
But gradually Kundalini corrects you and you find

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.920
the cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:53:12.120 --> 00:53:14.920
So this is a very important chakra is heart chakra.

00:53:15.160 --> 00:53:18.760
Now this heart chakra is so made you'll be amazed,

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:23.560
that heart is the one which has the Spirit,

00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:25.760
also it has the center heart,

00:53:25.960 --> 00:53:27.480
which is the Mother's.

00:53:27.680 --> 00:53:30.680
So this chakra is the most important chakra

00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:33.760
in the last happening of the Kundalini.

00:53:33.960 --> 00:53:39.680
Unless and until this breaks through it won't work out

00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:42.760
So motherhood is important,

00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:48.280
motherhood in your temperament and motherhood as a blessing to you,

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:50.720
all these things play a big part.

00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:52.760
And that's why motherhood is very important

00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.720
that you have to respect motherhood.

00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:58.040
Freud did just the opposite, of insulting.

00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.480
I mean this is anti-God activity

00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:02.640
because the Kundalini won't come up

00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:05.080
if you have no respect for motherhood.

00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:08.760
Maybe your mother may be a bad woman, all right, but in general

00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.760
you must have respect for motherhood.

00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:13.400
Or if you are a mother or if you are a woman

00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.880
you must have respect for yourself as a mother.

00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:19.880
The men should also have respect for mother.

00:54:20.120 --> 00:54:23.560
Motherhood is a very important part of Sahaja Yoga,

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.080
where you find that the heart chakra

00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:29.360
is this called as the Brahmarandra.

00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:30.800
Randra means the hole

00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.760
and the Brahma is the divine power that is spread out.

00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:36.840
So this is the hole which has to be broken

00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:38.600
or is to be pierced through

00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:43.800
and this is what is the actualization of baptism.

00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:46.600
This is what is the real baptism.

00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:50.600
It is not just artificial that anybody can put hand on your head

00:54:50.800 --> 00:54:55.080
and say: "All right, now you are a Christian" or "You are a muslim"

00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:58.320
or "You are a Jew". It is not so.

00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:01.640
This has to actualize within you.

00:55:01.880 --> 00:55:05.880
Now this happens when it comes up through this one.

00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:09.160
In front of that here, if you find,

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.840
is a part of the Nabhi chakra a little bit here,

00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:13.280
you can feel it sometimes.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.040
But here actually is the Vishuddhi chakra, if you see.

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:20.040
This is the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:55:20.240 --> 00:55:23.040
This is the Vishuddhi chakra means at this point

00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.360
your throat is controlled.

00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:29.240
But it is the center where this Vishuddhi chakra

00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.880
Shri Krishna becomes the primordial Being, the Akbar.

00:55:33.120 --> 00:55:38.680
So when you are not one with the whole,

00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:44.640
when you are detached from the whole, this becomes very problematic.

00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.960
Now, I have to tell you something about cancer,

00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:49.320
because it is threatening the world today.

00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:51.360
Is very simple, can be cured.

00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:54.000
A little bit I will have to tell you about cancer,

00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:56.440
how it develops in a person,

00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:59.160
whether he may be a good man or a bad man is not the point.

00:55:59.360 --> 00:56:03.960
As it is cancer is built up every moment and is broken up

00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:06.560
because when the sympathetic nervous system

00:56:06.800 --> 00:56:10.360
which is looked after by these two powers within us

00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:13.040
goes into overactivity,

00:56:13.240 --> 00:56:16.440
like the left and the right, the movement is so strong

00:56:16.640 --> 00:56:21.960
that it breaks the chakra, and the chakra moves apart.

00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:24.120
And the relationship with the whole,

00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:27.360
which is here with the whole, with the Medulla oblongata

00:56:27.600 --> 00:56:29.320
gets disconnected.

00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.120
Then anything on the left or the right,

00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:35.960
it is triggered by something, which I have told you before.

00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:39.320
This triggering when it takes place, it really gets seperated

00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:43.760
and the cells start growing on their own,

00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.960
they become malignant, means they are separated from the whole.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:49.560
Any man who behaves like that,

00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:52.280
who is broken from the whole, who doesn't understand of the whole,

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.280
is a malignant person.

00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:58.240
So the malignant cell starts growing in such a way

00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.840
that that cell whenever it touches another cell,

00:57:02.040 --> 00:57:03.840
that also becomes malignant.

00:57:04.080 --> 00:57:06.280
You may develop a nose very big,

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.840
or ears very big, or a tongue very big,

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:13.120
not related to the general growth of your body.

00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:16.600
So the controlling point of the whole is lost.

00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.800
Now [this is come] when it starts, you see, this [thing] really

00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.480
becomes a very big obstacle here, the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:57:25.720 --> 00:57:27.600
Is very important.

00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.720
But when it starts developing here the whole,

00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.200
what you call, the pressure, comes up here,

00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.600
which starts spreading on the sides.

00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:41.080
Moreover to add to the problem, to add to the problem,

00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:45.280
if you have been to wrong gurus, and wrong people

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:49.040
your void gets caught up, your void, the ten centers.

00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:51.080
These are the ten centers here.

00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:52.760
So we have eleven centers

00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:56.880
and these are the destroying forces of Shri Kalki,

00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:00.520
means our Lord Jesus Christ when he's going to come again,

00:58:00.760 --> 00:58:02.760
on the white horse, is this one.

00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:05.240
And this is called as sambar.

00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:08.040
At the equal level of the head

00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.720
and here there are eleven forces

00:58:10.920 --> 00:58:14.640
which are the destructive forces which come into play.

00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.440
Sometimes this side is more or sometimes this side is more,

00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:22.520
But when it starts working out, it starts destroying you

00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.200
and you may get any disease

00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:28.240
which is really destructive gradually to you.

00:58:28.440 --> 00:58:32.040
It can work out as any incurable diseases,

00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:35.600
any disease that eats you off, all those things will start

00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:39.720
and this portion of the head is a very important one.

00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:43.960
You are not supposed to bend this before anyone.

00:58:44.200 --> 00:58:46.640
You should not bend this before anyone,

00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:51.040
but when you have found out the right person, you can do it.

00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:54.080
Before Realization, I do not allow anybody

00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.560
to touch My Feet, at any cost.

00:58:56.800 --> 00:59:00.840
But if they are realized and approved as people

00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.920
who have started their vibrations cool,

00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.400
then only they are allowed to touch My Foot.

00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:08.240
That has to be very discrete, you see,

00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:12.960
because maybe the force is so much there, that you might faint.

00:59:13.160 --> 00:59:16.880
So one has to be careful as to see if you can bear it.

00:59:17.120 --> 00:59:21.040
So I was saying it is the other way round thing that works out.

00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.120
Now what Sahaja Yoga does is that it's the power

00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:27.840
that is flowing through the Sahaja Yogis who are here.

00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:33.920
And even my photograph has the power. If it has it has.

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:36.680
This can be used

00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.920
for giving vibrations to that part which is suffering.

00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.280
or that center which is not all right.

00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:45.880
People don't talk in the language as the doctors do.

00:59:46.080 --> 00:59:48.360
They just say what center is out.

00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:50.680
If they say Ekadesha is forming,

00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:54.040
that means there's a possibility of it turning into a cancer.

00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:56.880
Because cancer as I told you is built in, all the time,

00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:59.760
with overactivity and again neutralised

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:01.600
by parasympathetic nervous system.

01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:06.120
But the cancer that is going to settle down, is indicated here

01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.600
and you start feeling a throbbing over here

01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:10.560
of the Parashakti as it is called.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.080
But not necessarily. It can be the other way round also,

01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:15.200
when it is one of the symptoms, I would say,

01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:21.040
but can be that, if you feel here that kind of a

01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:23.760
heaviness or that kind of a pulsation here,

01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:27.240
not necessarily that you are going for a cancer.

01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.640
But it's one of the symptoms one can feel,

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.320
one of the sympthoms which you can.

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.760
But the best way is not to talk about the diseases,

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:36.960
but better to talk about the subtle thing, which are the chakras.

01:00:37.160 --> 01:00:39.920
If your chakras are in perfect state,

01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:43.400
if you can correct your chakras properly,

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:46.400
then you will have no problem of any kind.

01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.880
So now we have here up to Vishuddhi chakra,

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.760
and this is the Agnya chakra

01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.600
about which I have told you yesterday.

01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.080
So we have all the seven chakras in the brain.

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:02.520
Now the kundalini is brought up through this Agnya chakra

01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:06.280
and enters into this limbic area which is the kingdom of God.

01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:09.560
But here all these seven chakras get related to each other,

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:12.200
because these are the seats of the chakras.

01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:15.160
And that's how the integration start taking place.

01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:17.760
When little bit of integration is worked up,

01:01:17.960 --> 01:01:20.800
this opens out and the Kundalini passes out.

01:01:21.040 --> 01:01:23.640
This is what is the real knowledge.

01:01:23.840 --> 01:01:26.680
But people are so much enamored by their ego,

01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.560
by their own ideas that anybody who says,

01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.200
"All right you wear this dress you become a yogi.

01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400
You take this name you become a yogi.

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:37.680
Like this falsehood with which they live.

01:01:37.880 --> 01:01:39.640
You should not live with falsehood,

01:01:39.880 --> 01:01:44.720
because falsehood is not the way the life is. Life is reality.

01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:47.840
And it is such a beautiful thing to know the reality.

01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:51.120
because reality is nothing but glory and beauty.

01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.160
One should not be convinced if somebody says

01:01:53.360 --> 01:01:56.760
"All right you take this name. Your name is swami, such and such.

01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:00.840
or they say you are a phalaan [Anand Kakad] like

01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.400
This is not to be believed in,

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.640
because this is you are deceiving yourself.

01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:07.680
There is no need to change your name. Nothing is needed.

01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:09.320
The change comes within.

01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.280
You should not be satisfied with this changing of the dress.

01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.600
Supposing you wear a tail coat or you wear an ordinary coat

01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:18.120
makes no difference inside, does it?

01:02:18.320 --> 01:02:20.640
In the same way, if you color your clothes

01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.360
and go round saying that: "I'm such a yogi" and all that...

01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600
Remember that this is misleading

01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:28.480
Don't take to these things. You should not mislead yourself.

01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:31.440
You must fix yourself up to it.

01:02:31.680 --> 01:02:34.280
Now if you take drugs also, in the same way

01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:37.400
it harms you very much in your awareness and your brain,

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:41.320
and you find that there is a problem on the right hand backwards.

01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:44.840
Most of them must also give you on the right hand side a problem

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.040
because here the superego touches on the right hand side.

01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:50.280
Now those people who are extremely aggressive

01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:52.640
and have taken to aggressive methods and all that,

01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.200
this left side gets caught up.

01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:57.960
Now you must see, the nature has built within us

01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:03.240
a beautiful balancing phenomenon.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:05.720
Supposing you are a person who is very hard working.

01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:07.960
You work very hard, you go for the future

01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.840
and you do all kinds of things with your mind,

01:03:10.040 --> 01:03:11.960
and all the time you are planning and this and that,

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.840
the right side you are working on.

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.800
Actually you are working through your brain

01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.920
and your brain must go out.

01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:19.760
But no all such people even till the end,

01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.320
they'll go to their grave, they are very alert in the brains.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:26.600
Nothing goes wrong with the brain but the heart.

01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:28.240
Heart is the one that is caught up.

01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.560
You'll be surprised that never a person who is mad,

01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:33.000
gets a heart attack.

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.160
Because he is on the superego. Now, he is using his left side.

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.960
He is using his left side.

01:03:40.160 --> 01:03:44.800
He should get his heart, but he gets his brain out.

01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:48.320
Just imagine the balancing forces that are working in you.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:50.640
Actually when you get your first attack

01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:54.080
remember that you are overdoing it. Stop it at that moment.

01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:56.600
It's an indication coming to you from nature.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:00.800
But we know, we'll have an operation and again go like a big horse.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:03.120
There's no need.

01:04:03.320 --> 01:04:06.760
There's no need. But another thing is that in Sahaja Yoga

01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:09.040
you really settle down in the center.

01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:11.960
You don't have this problems of going to extremes,

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.240
or getting to extreme behaviors,

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:19.560
and you get to a point where you really realize

01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:24.000
that you are the Spirit and you are the absolute being.

01:04:24.200 --> 01:04:26.160
It's not any ego and superego

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:29.680
because then you don't say that I did this.

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:34.480
Like supposing there's a lady who came with Me to America

01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:36.600
and she called herself a [moron].

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.840
And she said: "Mother, You must give him Realization".

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:39.960
I said: "I'm trying.

01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:42.600
So breaking my hands on the working morning till evening

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:45.600
I'm trying but what to do, I can't do it now."

01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.520
I said: "All right you are a realized soul, you give a certificate".

01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:50.840
She said: "How can I give a false certificate?

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:54.760
Because it is not there". You start speaking in the third way.

01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.960
You say: "It is not there." "It is not coming."

01:04:57.160 --> 01:05:00.080
"It is not working." You don't say: "I'm not working it out."

01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.160
You don't say that "I'm not doing it" or "I am doing it."

01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:06.600
What you say that, "I'm trying but it doesn't come out",

01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.280
"It doesn't come out". It, you start talking in a third way.

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:14.320
And that is what happens to you, you lose your ego.

01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:16.040
In Sahaja Yoga also we have seen,

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:17.840
some people who come to Sahaja Yoga,

01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:20.960
get into ego trips, because it's a habit.

01:05:21.200 --> 01:05:23.800
It's a very bad habit in the West to get into ego trips.

01:05:24.040 --> 01:05:26.760
You see, just they jump into some imaginary balloons,

01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:29.640
I don't know what, and they start thinking: "I am this, I am that".

01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.280
I'm quite frightened to see this fellow was quite a normal person

01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:35.760
till yesterday. Now what has happened to him?

01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:37.840
So you see this ego is such a thing

01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:40.320
that if one egoistical person comes in

01:05:40.560 --> 01:05:42.240
the another can take up from that person.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:44.160
It's such a horrible stuff is.

01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.560
They are very contagious, very contagious.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:48.360
and that's how you will find that

01:05:48.560 --> 01:05:51.400
one egoistical now, if the husband shouts the wife will shout.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:53.240
And the wife shouts then the husband beats.

01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:55.560
If supposing, one person just stops,

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:58.080
not shouting, it will calm down, definitely.

01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:00.800
But the contagious disease goes on increasing

01:06:01.000 --> 01:06:03.360
that the children become shouters. It goes on like that.

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.920
So the ego is a thing that one does not feel it,

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:10.720
does not understand it and it goes on destroying you, all the time.

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:14.960
And the ego gives you a self-importance, but not self-esteem.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.920
It doesn't give you self-esteem.

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.520
It just gives you self importance, unlimited.

01:06:19.760 --> 01:06:21.160
But what have you achieved?

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.240
So, to be the Spirit you become a humble person.

01:06:24.440 --> 01:06:28.960
You need to become absolutely humble.

01:06:29.520 --> 01:06:31.800
One gentleman once told Me

01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.880
that, "I've heard you are doing such great things.

01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:36.760
And I've known you for 25 years.

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:39.640
I did not know that you are Mataji Nirmala Devi.

01:06:39.880 --> 01:06:43.320
I only knew you as Mrs. Shrivastava wife of such and such".

01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:48.320
And he was the High Court,

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.440
Hague High Court's, German he is.

01:06:50.680 --> 01:06:52.040
And so, I said "All right".

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:54.840
He said, "No, you are coming tomorrow to my house.

01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:56.960
You have to give me Realization. I never knew."

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.840
So I said, "How did you come to know?" He said, "We have a...

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.880
He is from the royal family, another maharaja,

01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.960
who had your photograph in his pocket.

01:07:05.160 --> 01:07:07.280
And he took it out and put it to his head". So I said,

01:07:07.480 --> 01:07:09.040
"What's the matter?" He said, "You see,

01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.760
I have a very bad heart trouble and Mataji cured me.

01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.360
So he said, "Look at the photograph". And he said, "Oh, God.

01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:15.560
This is Mrs. Shrivastava.

01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:19.000
I knew her for 25 years. I never knew she could even speak.

01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.840
So She speaks and not only She speaks to all them

01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:25.040
He said, "We can't believe it this woman could speak.

01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:28.760
Because what I known her for this, is she's a very quiet person".

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.040
So for all practical purposes I'm a very quiet person.

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.760
And then he, you know, then came and he got his Realization.

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.040
And he's such a humble man, you won't believe.

01:07:39.240 --> 01:07:41.720
He's such a humble man. He said "I've found it".

01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.280
He's a very learned personality.

01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:48.200
There is so many like that, we have an ambassador of Spain

01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:51.560
who was another humble man, you see. And he came to Me and he said

01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:54.080
"Mother give me Realization, I've come to know about it.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.440
Of course on that level I don't talk to people.

01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.960
He got his Realization

01:07:58.160 --> 01:08:01.040
and if I'm sitting, say, on a chair he would not sit.

01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:02.640
He will sit on the ground.

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:04.800
The governor of Kashmir, I think.

01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.600
This is a very different style thing in India is.

01:08:07.840 --> 01:08:09.760
I must tell you, we people are very different.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.280
Even a garbage cleaner becomes such a big governor here

01:08:13.480 --> 01:08:16.160
that it's impossible to talk. It's a very funny thing.

01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.720
I'll tell you a story.

01:08:17.960 --> 01:08:19.920
Once a garbage cleaner came to our house, you see.

01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:23.200
And I said, "All right, this is an extra garbage, you throw it away"

01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:26.360
So he said, "All right, I'm willing to throw it away, the garbage,

01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:28.920
but how much are you going to pay me? I said, "All right,

01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:31.120
if you say, I'll give you some 10 pounds or something.

01:08:31.320 --> 01:08:34.400
He said, "You Indians, you don't know any laws, rules, regulations

01:08:34.600 --> 01:08:36.640
this, that and started shouting at Me.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:40.960
And this gentleman of the Hague High Court,

01:08:41.160 --> 01:08:44.720
the chairman of Hague High Court, the judge was standing there.

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.600
He came out, he said, "Why are you talking so loudly to her?

01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:49.600
This is not the way to talk to a lady.

01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.120
He said, "What do you know about laws?"

01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.800
He's the one who's in charge there.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.800
"Oh, you Indians, I know how terrible you are,

01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.000
you have no idea of laws".

01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:58.760
You see, he was the one who was taking bribe from Me actually,

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:01.760
and he was telling off this fellow like this. There is no humility,

01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:03.840
there's no respect.

01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.520
A garbage cleaner talking like to the head

01:09:07.720 --> 01:09:10.640
of the organization which is dealing with law,

01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:13.760
who has written so many books on human laws, can you imagine?

01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:17.200
There is no sense of proportion in people, that, what are we?

01:09:17.400 --> 01:09:20.880
Why should we be so boastful, arrogant and rude.

01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:24.520
It's not good, it's not human, it's like animals behavior.

01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:27.520
It's not a good thing. We have to be gentle,

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.280
absolutely gentle, because we are human.

01:09:30.560 --> 01:09:34.120
God has given us so much. What blessings God has given us.

01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:36.800
I find Australians still very much better

01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.760
than any other western people, I must tell you,

01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:41.720
whatever people may say about you. That's my experience is.

01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:44.240
And I always tell everybody "You have to learn a lot from them,

01:09:44.440 --> 01:09:47.320
because they are innocent people, they are simple and innocent,

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.160
and all the time they want to know what's wrong with them.

01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.640
They are simple people. They want to know about it.

01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.600
But I'm just telling you be careful about this mister ego.

01:09:55.800 --> 01:09:59.520
He's a horrible stuff, it always comes up for nothing at all,

01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:03.800
and is of no use. It's an empty vessel that makes too much noise.

01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:08.400
So now today, we are going to again have the session of Realization,

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.360
and this is the seven chakras on the limbic area.

01:10:11.600 --> 01:10:15.320
When you get the Realization, all these chakras

01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:19.720
get completely enlightened within you, as you progress,

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:23.360
and all your centers get absolutely enlightened,

01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:27.960
and you get all these different deities awakened within you.

01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:31.200
Then the power that, you see, you receive first, is

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.560
that you receive complete bliss and joy.

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.920
Of course in the west, people feel joy at the last I must say.

01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.600
But mentally they understand, they become very equipped mentally.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:46.680
Dr. Warren, who is sitting before you, he was the same.

01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:47.800
I've seen with all of them.

01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:50.040
First, they become mentally very equipped.

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.720
They know so much because, you see,

01:10:51.920 --> 01:10:53.680
the whole knowledge comes into their head first,

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:55.320
for their brains are more developed.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:57.560
While the people who have heart more developed

01:10:57.760 --> 01:10:59.200
they first feel the joy.

01:10:59.400 --> 01:11:02.640
You know the Fiji people who were here yesterday, day before,

01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.760
I said: "How are you feeling?". "We are feeling the joy".

01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.760
Ananda [ra], there's a joy coming out.

01:11:07.040 --> 01:11:10.600
Because their hearts are open. So that is what happens to people

01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.880
who are too much mentally involved.

01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:17.320
This is what happens to them. And those who are

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:20.240
involved in the heart, they start feeling the joy, doesn't matter.

01:11:20.440 --> 01:11:23.640
But the growth takes place, a transformation takes place.

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:27.040
Overnight people have given up their drugs,

01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:29.320
their diseases, so many things have happened.

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:33.800
But you must know that truth can be little shattering,

01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.840
to your preconceived ideas.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:40.720
But God cannot remain with you as He wanted to be.

01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:45.080
He is what He is, He will be what He has to be.

01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:46.960
You cannot command God

01:11:47.200 --> 01:11:50.960
that "You stay like this. Now I'm going to organize you."

01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:56.000
He has organized everything for us, we cannot organize for Him.

01:11:56.200 --> 01:12:01.000
He works the way He works, every time, every minute.

01:12:01.200 --> 01:12:04.360
for Him is all perfect.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:06.120
And for you also it will be because

01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.600
you will be living in the present.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:13.800
When you start living in the present, every moment is dynamic.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:19.400
You really become a dynamic person, not a cabbage, not a mad man,

01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:24.000
but a dynamic, wonderful person, who's rid of all his problems.

01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:25.760
Dr. Warren himself had

01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.720
blood pressure, I don't know all sorts of problems he had.

01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.920
And it's all got corrected. But there are so many

01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:33.640
who are sitting here, at least there are 30, 40 people

01:12:33.880 --> 01:12:36.080
who will tell that, how they got cured of their problems.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.800
So you all should just think that here is somebody

01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:45.520
who is just here for your benefit.

01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:48.200
And there's nothing to worry.

01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.440
That's all he was trying to tell you

01:12:50.680 --> 01:12:52.000
and I have to tell you the same.

01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:54.480
But this Sahasrara has to open out.

01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:58.160
In a way, if you start doubting Me, Sahasrara doesn't open.

01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:01.280
Because I am there. I must tell you I'm in the Sahasrara.

01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.400
That's the way, I am there.

01:13:03.680 --> 01:13:06.000
You can find out later on when you find pressures on you head,

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:08.600
you have to take My name, otherwise doesn't open out.

01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.240
What can I do about? I am there.

01:13:11.440 --> 01:13:13.800
So you have to just not accept me or surrender

01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.480
or what are you going to surrender?

01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:18.040
Except for ego what do you have to surrender?

01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.720
So there's nothing to be surrendered

01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.080
nothing to be given to Me, nothing.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:26.480
Just you have to take more, become deeper and deeper and deeper,

01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:29.160
and a personality who is enriched.

01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:31.200
But in Sahaja Yoga there are no courses,

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:33.760
nothing of the kind. You have to work it out,

01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.520
come to the center, it's a collective happening,

01:13:36.800 --> 01:13:39.440
It's not a single person, sitting at home.

01:13:39.680 --> 01:13:41.600
You all have to come,

01:13:41.840 --> 01:13:44.360
make your progress, progress further and further.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:47.240
You'll be looked after very well, with love,

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.600
and you will see how people are transformed,

01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:53.200
how gentle they are, how nice they are, how kind they are.

01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.680
Maybe one of them may turn out to be egoistical,

01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.280
so you just treat him as a mad man. Can be, you see,

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.080
who is used to this thing they go back, for again circle,

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:03.480
and again they come back. But doesn't matter.

01:14:03.720 --> 01:14:06.480
So I have to request you that you must come on a Sunday

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:09.680
where I would like to meet you all and today let us see

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.120
how many of you feel the cool breeze.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:16.000
Now I would request you to take out your shoes and sit in a way

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:22.040
that you are touching the Mother earth with both the feet.

01:14:36.040 --> 01:14:38.520
Sahaja Yoga is only meant for true seekers,

01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.920
not for people who are false people

01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:45.640
or who want to satisfy themselves with falsehood.

01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:51.440
You have to ask for truth and if you ask for truth, you will get it.

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:02.800
Now the first thing as I told you before,

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:07.200
you have to understand that

01:15:07.400 --> 01:15:10.920
you should not feel guilty. That is very important.

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:13.560
Now somebody started arguing with Me,

01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:16.200
that "God has told me to feel guilty". Now again I don't know

01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:19.240
which God has told you. You see, all these ideas you you give up.

01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:23.160
Please do not feel guilty at all, because

01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:28.080
I'm saying that God is forgiveness, God is love.

01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.360
He's anxious to give you Realisation.

01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.760
He's extremely anxious that you should get it. The time has come.

01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.520
This is the Last Judgement. You see the resurrection time.

01:15:36.760 --> 01:15:41.880
You have to get it, there's no other way out

01:15:42.120 --> 01:15:44.880
for Him also because He has to save His creation

01:15:45.080 --> 01:15:46.920
and His creation are human beings.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.920
So please for Heaven's sake do not feel guilty.

01:15:50.120 --> 01:15:53.240
This is a very important time. If you are feeling guilty,

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.440
you just tell yourself that "Mother I'm not guilty".

01:15:56.680 --> 01:15:57.920
That is the first condition,

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:02.520
that you should not feel guilty at all at this time.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:05.600
All right. Then the second condition is that

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:08.240
you close your eyes and put your hands towards Me.

01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:11.640
So that you understand that there is no mesmerism.

01:16:11.880 --> 01:16:13.960
Or for what I should mesmerize you? There is no...

01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:16.040
But you see you have to close your eyes and please

01:16:16.240 --> 01:16:21.200
don't open your eyes, because when the Agnya chakra,

01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:26.160
when your eyes are opened Agnya chakra

01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:28.800
doesn't allow the Kundalini to pass through,

01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:31.720
So please do not open your eyes till I tell you.

01:16:31.960 --> 01:16:34.320
Because as I told you, there is no mesmerism, nothing.

01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.960
It works like sunshine.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.320
So just pur your hands towards Me like this,

01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:42.560
on your lap, very comfortably. Very comfortably be seated.

01:16:42.760 --> 01:16:45.160
Extremely comfortably you all should sit down.

01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:50.320
Put both the hands with your fingers little bit stretched.

01:16:52.720 --> 01:16:56.160
And close your eyes. You can remove your spectacles, will help you.

01:16:56.360 --> 01:16:59.160
Or any malas(garlands) or anything you are wearing in your neck,

01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.080
which is heavy. If there's something heavy, or may,

01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:07.040
please take it out. Also one has to be

01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:08.760
little bit loose in the waist.

01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:12.280
If a, it's very tight something on the waist, you see,

01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:13.920
may be not good.

01:17:14.120 --> 01:17:17.040
So something, or in the neck, necktie or something,

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.680
should be also loosen.

01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.800
Please put your hands towards Me. Just this.

01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:34.000
Please take out your spectacles please,

01:17:34.200 --> 01:17:36.360
because it affects your eyesight also,

01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.280
It might improve your eyesight.

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:41.240
Both the hands towards Me.

01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:47.200
Both the hands towards Me, like this, on your lap.

01:17:55.920 --> 01:18:00.480
Now, as I told you, the left hand is the desire.

01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:02.640
So keep the left hand as it is.

01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:04.760
But as I tell you, you have to move the right hand.

01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.640
But don't open your eyes, please.

01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.760
Please don't open your eyes.

01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:13.800
Just don't open your eyes, that is very important.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:20.720
You must sit still and don't do any movements.

01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:23.560
Just keep it still.

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.440
You need not bend your head or push it back.

01:18:26.680 --> 01:18:27.960
Make it straight, that's all.

01:18:28.200 --> 01:18:29.960
But no pressure on your neck.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:34.800
Sit in a way that is comfortable to begin with.

01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:44.240
Now, we have to put our right hand on the heart.

01:18:44.680 --> 01:18:48.960
Just on the heart. And to say,

01:18:49.200 --> 01:18:54.240
"Mother, I am the Spirit", with all confidence.

01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:55.840
Say it thrice.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:19:00.080
Because you are, you are the Spirit, no doubt.

01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.040
And that Spirit has to manifest

01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:05.240
to show you what glorious thing you are.

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:09.200
You are not your ego, you are not your mind,

01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:12.760
you're not your body, but you are the Spirit,

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:15.400
the reflection of God Almighty within you.

01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:19.240
So say it on your heart.

01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.800
Steady down, steady, steady down.

01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:29.680
Put your left hand towards Me, left hand towards Me, yes.

01:19:29.880 --> 01:19:34.080
Steady down, steady. You must steady yourselves.

01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:42.800
Now put down this right hand on the stomach, on the left hand side.

01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:44.800
And with full confidence you have to say,

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:49.520
to awaken your principle of primordial master within you,

01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:53.640
to say "Mother I am my own master, I am my own guru,

01:19:53.840 --> 01:19:57.040
I am my own guide".

01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.360
Ten times.

01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:01.840
Because, if you are the Spirit

01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:06.120
then the Spirit guides you through vibratory awareness.

01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.800
And once you said, "I am the Spirit",

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.360
you have to accept all the aspects of Spirit

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:16.240
by saying that "the Spirit is my guide and I am the Spirit".

01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:20.120
Please say it ten times.

01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.640
Now put your attention

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.480
there where you have put your hand and say that,

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:49.600
"Mother I am the master, I am the guru, I am my own guide".

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:55.880
This is to awaken within you. Say it with confidence, please.

01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:01.040
Now

01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.360
put your left hand towards Me

01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:09.040
and right hand towards the stomach, I said, on the stomach.

01:21:09.240 --> 01:21:12.960
Press it with your fingers.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:14.720
On the left side.

01:21:14.960 --> 01:21:19.160
Now if you have said it ten times

01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:22.720
you put the hand again on your heart.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:26.680
Again go back to the same point, that you are the Spirit.

01:21:26.880 --> 01:21:30.240
That's the second point. So you have to say,

01:21:30.440 --> 01:21:32.800
"Mother, I am the Spirit", but twelve times,

01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.720
because this center has got twelve subplexuses,

01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:40.440
twelve petals. So you have to say, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:21:40.680 --> 01:21:43.040
This is very good for all the people who have heart attacks,

01:21:43.240 --> 01:21:46.800
heart troubles, heart problems, it's very good for them.

01:21:46.960 --> 01:21:50.280
This is the mantra.

01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.280
This is the chanting.

01:22:06.560 --> 01:22:09.760
Now raise your right hand on the Vishuddhi chakra,

01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.240
left side of your neck.

01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:18.240
That's the Vishuddhi. Left hand side of your neck.

01:22:18.480 --> 01:22:23.400
This is the center which goes out of gear in many people

01:22:23.760 --> 01:22:25.600
because they feel guilty.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:31.760
It's very simple. So you have to say: "Mother I am not guilty".

01:22:32.120 --> 01:22:35.960
Left is very much catching.

01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:49.040
For anything whatsoever.

01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:51.200
Don't think of your guilt, of the past.

01:22:51.400 --> 01:22:54.440
Forget it, because you are going to be transformed.

01:22:54.680 --> 01:22:58.960
As I told you yesterday an egg has to become a bird.

01:22:59.200 --> 01:23:02.680
Then does not matter, the egg whatever specks it has.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:06.680
it's finished once the shell is out.

01:23:06.960 --> 01:23:09.400
So just say sixteen times,

01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:13.960
"Mother I am not guilty, I am not guilty".

01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:28.640
Now you are entering into the temple of God

01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:31.200
and a guilty person cannot enter.

01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:34.720
Because you are the Spirit, how can you be guilty?

01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:38.360
You cannot be guilty because you are the Spirit.

01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:41.640
Come back to the same point. Because you are the Spirit

01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:45.280
you cannot enter

01:23:45.480 --> 01:23:48.760
into the idea of guilt.

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:54.680
Spirit is never attached to any such ideas.

01:23:55.960 --> 01:23:58.120
Good.

01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:03.680
Now put the right hand on your forehead.

01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:09.600
Across. At this point you have to say:

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:14.080
"Mother, I forgive everyone". You have to forgive everyone.

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:17.840
Please forgive everyone,

01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.440
because the Spirit is the forgiving force within us.

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:28.080
Christ forgave people who crucified Him.

01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:31.560
And not only that, but he asked God,

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:33.480
His Father to forgive them,

01:24:33.720 --> 01:24:36.360
for they did not know what they where doing.

01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.760
In His name you have to forgive.

01:24:38.960 --> 01:24:43.680
Forgive everyone. Just forgive everyone.

01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:47.200
It's very easy to say that.

01:24:47.400 --> 01:24:53.240
And you just say it and it works out. It's amazingly

01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:56.920
powerful.

01:24:57.160 --> 01:25:02.360
Now put this hand steadily on your head, on top of your head.

01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:05.920
Now you'll find it's rather heavy in the center part.

01:25:06.120 --> 01:25:11.320
Try to press it with your palm a little bit.

01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:15.480
At this time, you have to say: "Mother, give me Realisation".

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.800
Because I cannot cross your freedom. You are free.

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:21.880
So you have to just say: "Mother, please give me my Realisation",

01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:23.160
at this point.

01:25:23.360 --> 01:25:28.360
Say it seven times, because there are seven centers.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.680
Now just put you hand upper four inches

01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:50.960
and see if there's a cool breeze coming in.

01:25:53.880 --> 01:25:56.080
Now try with another hand. Put right hand down

01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:00.440
and left hand you try if there's a cool breeze coming in.

01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.720
I think it has worked out.

01:26:46.960 --> 01:26:49.520
You can put both the hands towards Me now.

01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:51.720
It's like raising the mountains I tell you.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.120
It's really like raising the mountains.

01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:58.200
Now put your both the hands up in the sky. Let's see.

01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:02.160
Just like this, higher.

01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:06.680
And ask the question, "Mother is this

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:09.200
the breeze of the Holy Ghost?".

01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:11.800
Just ask in your heart,

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:16.040
"Is this the cool wind of the Holy Ghost?"

01:27:16.240 --> 01:27:18.200
"Is this the Brahma shakti?

01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:20.960
Is this the All Pervading power of God?"

01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:24.160
Just ask the question.

01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:27.960
Only these questions will give you answer as answer.

01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:31.200
And now you can ask also, "Mother are you the Holy Ghost?"

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:37.080
Let's see. "Mother are you the Holy Ghost?" Ask three times.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:49.640
It is start working faster with that question.

01:27:51.960 --> 01:27:55.160
Felt it? Now put down your hands,

01:27:55.360 --> 01:27:57.600
and see for yourself,.

01:27:57.800 --> 01:27:59.440
Slowly open your eyes.

01:27:59.680 --> 01:28:05.280
See if it works in your hand a kind of a sensation flowing in.

01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:18.600
Now we'll then show you also

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:20.320
how to protect yourself,

01:28:20.560 --> 01:28:22.760
because once you are realised, you're like that,

01:28:22.960 --> 01:28:27.200
absolutely a newly born

01:28:27.440 --> 01:28:30.240
or newly awakened seed.

01:28:30.440 --> 01:28:34.240
So you are to be protected and how to protect yourself

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:38.440
nicely, and how to give Kundalini awakening,

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:41.160
both things Dr. Warren will show you,

01:28:41.360 --> 01:28:43.520
how to raise your Kundalini yourself

01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:46.440
and how to protect yourself when you go out.

01:28:46.760 --> 01:28:49.720
And I hope you will make it convenient all of you

01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:53.440
to come and see Me on Sunday.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:56.640
Thank you.

01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:02.280
Dr Warren: Just put the left hand at the level of the Kundalini,

01:29:02.480 --> 01:29:05.760
and the right hand at above and at the front

01:29:05.960 --> 01:29:10.760
take it down, back and up. This is the manner of turning it.

01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:16.320
So lift it, putting your attention to the Kundalini,

01:29:16.600 --> 01:29:20.280
take it right up, give it a twist,

01:29:20.480 --> 01:29:25.160
and knot it once, and bring your hands down.

01:29:25.400 --> 01:29:31.000
Again we raise it. Hands down at the Kundalini. Turn it.

01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:34.280
Up,

01:29:34.480 --> 01:29:36.320
and raise it

01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:41.480
above the head and twist it, and knot it once.

01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:46.600
And this time three times for the three channels."

01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:50.080
Three sides, three gunas. - Dr Warren: "three knots".

01:29:50.280 --> 01:29:52.720
Three powers.

01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:56.400
Dr Warren: "Whirl it and knot it once.

01:29:56.680 --> 01:29:58.800
Turn it

01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:00.920
and knot it twice.

01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.800
Turn it

01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:05.760
and knot it three times and just bring your hands down

01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:07.200
and put them towards Mother.

01:30:07.400 --> 01:30:09.920
Open your fingers out.

01:30:10.160 --> 01:30:12.880
and see if you're feeling it.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:15.120
Now ask them to give bandhan. [unclear]

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:20.440
Dr: Now the second aspect, as Mother said is to protect yourself.

01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.000
We do this by what is called a bandhan.

01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:26.040
It's like an umbrella we are putting over ourselves.

01:30:26.240 --> 01:30:29.040
-Dr Warren: So we put our hand... -SM: Your aura is to be protected.

01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:30.720
So the aura is to be protected.

01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.080
Dr. Warren: "We put our left hand towards Mother

01:30:34.320 --> 01:30:38.080
and our right hand over the side at the lowest chakra.

01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:40.600
And we come over the top

01:30:40.800 --> 01:30:43.720
and down once,

01:30:43.920 --> 01:30:46.920
back twice, seven times.

01:30:47.120 --> 01:30:50.360
Again over, three times

01:30:50.640 --> 01:30:53.400
back over, four times,

01:30:53.680 --> 01:30:56.720
back over, five times,

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.480
six and seven.

01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:03.800
Put your hands back up, too.

01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:05.720
You protected yourself by a bandhan,

01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:09.160
which simply means a bond of love.

01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:14.960
There is another thing one has to know, that

01:31:15.600 --> 01:31:19.120
when this is a power of love flowing through your hands now,

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:21.080
it's a power of love.

01:31:21.280 --> 01:31:23.480
We have to steady it of course, we have to know

01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:26.920
what it is, how it works, how you have to give Realisation.

01:31:27.120 --> 01:31:29.680
Now you can give realisation to people.

01:31:29.880 --> 01:31:32.920
You can cure people. All these powers you have got now.

01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.760
But first you must steady yourself.

01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:38.040
Steadiness is very important in Sahaja Yoga, to begin with.

01:31:38.240 --> 01:31:41.760
And then you will be amazed that if you are standing somewhere,

01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:44.960
if there's an accident, accident will be avoided.

01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.800
You tell somebody, the person will feel healed.

01:31:48.040 --> 01:31:50.280
It's a tremendous thing because you're tremendous,

01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.000
but you have to feel that within yourself.

01:31:53.240 --> 01:31:55.480
You must practice it first of all

01:31:55.760 --> 01:31:58.800
and then test it if you have got it or not.

01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:00.960
But not with doubts, but with confidence

01:32:01.160 --> 01:32:02.960
that you are now the saints.

01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:07.080
You are the prophets as William Blake has said

01:32:07.280 --> 01:32:11.400
that God of man is described these times, God of man,

01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.600
will become prophets and the prophets

01:32:16.800 --> 01:32:20.360
will later on, make others prophets.

01:32:20.680 --> 01:32:22.680
And this is exactly what is happening.

01:32:22.880 --> 01:32:24.160
Another person is William Blake

01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.040
who has completely described Sahaja Yoga.

01:32:27.240 --> 01:32:30.760
So I would like to meet you personally when you come there,

01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:36.880
and I hope we'll be able to provide you with good lunch also.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:42.000
It was very kind of you, all of you, to come down and meet Me.

01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:47.240
I've been very anxious to meet you all. May God bless you.

01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:50.600
What's it? Dr. Warren: It's o.k.

01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:52.120
It's talking too much.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.640
Dr. Warren: For those people who don't know the address,

01:32:54.840 --> 01:32:56.960
I think it's well implanted in your mind

01:32:57.160 --> 01:33:00.760
that 172 Albert Road,

01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:03.440
Stratfield, 10 o'clock on Sunday.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:06.720
And ask them to bring salt, sugar and oil.

01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:09.880
Dr Warren: "As I've told before Mother's requested you to bring

01:33:10.120 --> 01:33:14.320
salt, about half a pound, something like that.

01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.480
Salt and sugar and a small bottle of water.

01:33:17.760 --> 01:33:21.600
She will vibrate it for you to have your own vibrated drinking water

01:33:21.800 --> 01:33:25.440
and some oil, because you may need it for massage purposes

01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:27.320
or otherwise for healing.

01:33:27.640 --> 01:33:31.040
so salt, sugar, about half a pound

01:33:31.240 --> 01:33:33.320
