00:00:05.868 --> 00:00:08.721
Now in this place I am going to start

00:00:08.801 --> 00:00:12.554
within say two, three days, after Diwali,

00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:15.467
a morning session, say about,

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:19.621
we can start about five o'clock every morning,

00:00:19.701 --> 00:00:22.868
or five thirty every morning.

00:00:23.801 --> 00:00:27.487
You have to have your bath before coming here.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:30.788
Say five thirty, or five
o'clock, will that be all right?

00:00:30.868 --> 00:00:34.601
Your Mother gets up at four thirty whatever may happen.

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:39.387
You have to change your habits. You have to.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:44.821
Get up in the morning. You know by getting
up in the morning you finish off so much of work.

00:00:44.901 --> 00:00:49.020
Because in the night what do you do?
Just gossip, waste your time.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.888
But if you say that, "Tonight let me sleep
late and tomorrow I'll get up early," you'll never.

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:56.454
First get up early then you'll sleep early.

00:00:56.534 --> 00:01:00.020
The other way around. You see, you
have to see your mind how it works.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.920
So get up in the morning, have
your bath and sit down for meditation.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.953
It's quite a warm room. So have your nice hot bath,

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.220
sit down for your meditation
for about an hour or so, meditate.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.687
You'll feel so nice. After some
time you cannot sleep after four thirty.

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:18.888
Now look at my system, I mean whether I am in America,

00:01:18.968 --> 00:01:21.554
or whether I am in India, I get up at four thirty.

00:01:21.634 --> 00:01:23.167
How do I manage?

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:27.687
I have no watch or thing like
that, I just get up at four thirty.

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:30.868
I have tuned Myself to the sun.

00:01:31.801 --> 00:01:35.033
You are tuned more to the moon.

00:01:36.234 --> 00:01:38.554
I've tuned Myself to the sun.

00:01:38.634 --> 00:01:41.721
When the sun comes at this angle I have to get up

00:01:41.801 --> 00:01:46.320
because that is the time the
vibrations start to flow, all over the world.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.621
At four thirty in the morning all these vibrations

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:54.534
the best time, flow in the purest form.

00:01:56.567 --> 00:02:01.154
That's why all the seers get
up very early in the morning,

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:03.387
have their bath,

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:06.754
and sit down for meditation. It's too much I know,

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:09.987
specially for Englishmen.

00:02:10.067 --> 00:02:12.554
But you have to train up yourself.

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:16.154
You will do it, you will like
it, if you do it like a festival.

00:02:16.234 --> 00:02:20.187
See today is a festival day, let
us get up and have a nice bath,

00:02:20.267 --> 00:02:25.821
and have a nice soap you see, perfumed
one and nice things and ... you'll enjoy.

00:02:25.901 --> 00:02:29.267
Bath should be a ritual.

00:02:30.267 --> 00:02:33.354
But should not be all the time.

00:02:33.434 --> 00:02:37.621
Because I see they are just sitting there quite happy.

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:40.821
Like Indians also, they bathe
too much, that is not necessary.

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:42.554
Too much not, but one.

00:02:42.634 --> 00:02:44.187
And then if you sit at home

00:02:44.267 --> 00:02:47.487
for about an hour or so, the house is lighted.

00:02:47.567 --> 00:02:50.320
I could get this place lighted in the morning

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.487
you come here, you will be amazed

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:55.254
that if you develop this habit

00:02:55.334 --> 00:02:59.721
you can do such a lot, because in the
evening you are tired, you cannot do many things,

00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:01.888
and you are absolutely fade down you see.

00:03:01.968 --> 00:03:03.953
So you'll sleep early.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:08.554
And this is the English thing,
"early to bed and early to rise".

00:03:08.634 --> 00:03:10.801
Not Indian, is it?

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.421
And that's what we have to do. And you'll
be amazed you'll do thousand and one things,

00:03:18.501 --> 00:03:21.567
thousand and one things if
you get up early in the morning.
