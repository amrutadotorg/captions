1
00:45:06,759 --> 00:45:11,559
I am sorry, I had to speak in Marathi
language

2
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:18,059
because I had to tell them something
which I don't want you to know.

3
00:45:28,571 --> 00:45:32,742
Today is a great day, I should say
in a way,

4
00:45:33,226 --> 00:45:40,135
because I am going to tell you
one thing great.

5
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:47,873
That is Shri Gyaneshwara - in Marathi
they call it 'Dnyaneshwara' -

6
00:45:49,242 --> 00:45:56,372
He was the incarnation of Kartikeya.

7
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:11,119
And Saraswati, who was a virgin,
she looked after Him like Her own son.

8
00:46:11,144 --> 00:46:18,961
He was the brother of Shri Ganapati
but She looked after Him.

9
00:46:18,986 --> 00:46:23,189
And then also there’s description how
He was born and all those (things),

10
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:26,357
 is very interesting.

11
00:46:26,382 --> 00:46:36,641
But here in this place, in this Maharashtra,
He took His incarnation.

12
00:46:36,666 --> 00:46:42,421
And also there were many great, great,
very great saints

13
00:46:42,446 --> 00:46:51,794
in so many numbers took place,
took their birth in this Maharashtra.

14
00:46:53,132 --> 00:47:00,342
But such horrible people, they tortured
their lives.

15
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:03,353
Worse than Christian Inquisition I tell you;

16
00:47:03,378 --> 00:47:07,616
worse than any inquisition anywhere.

17
00:47:07,641 --> 00:47:11,143
Individually they attacked.

18
00:47:11,168 --> 00:47:16,669
And that same people are born again

19
00:47:18,211 --> 00:47:23,829
in this great country of Maharashtra.

20
00:47:23,854 --> 00:47:27,334
They are very talented people; they write
very well.

21
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:31,704
Their language is so rich.

22
00:47:31,729 --> 00:47:38,693
You can see that, what description

23
00:47:40,255 --> 00:47:51,222
of a realized soul, given by Gyaneshwara,
is so beautiful.

24
00:47:52,521 --> 00:48:00,045
He says that, "The moon doesn’t run
after moonlight,

25
00:48:00,070 --> 00:48:05,339
the sun doesn’t run after sunlight.

26
00:48:05,364 --> 00:48:14,022
In that way a realized soul doesn’t bother
about his own glory.

27
00:48:16,845 --> 00:48:23,642
The sun shines till it shines, then it
takes back all his rays.

28
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:30,701
Whatever work the rays have to do
they do it. And the sun is just watching,

29
00:48:30,969 --> 00:48:34,741
watching all the work, then he takes
them back.

30
00:48:34,766 --> 00:48:42,424
And he gets completely contained within
himself”.

31
00:48:42,449 --> 00:48:49,075
Samavun ghene, completely contained
within himself.

32
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:55,067
The description He has given of realized
souls

33
00:48:55,092 --> 00:49:01,604
is so beautiful, if you could just
experience it.

34
00:49:01,629 --> 00:49:06,117
Namadeva, who was born much later,
said that

35
00:49:06,142 --> 00:49:15,573
even one line of Gyanesha [Gyaneshwara]
if you could experience,

36
00:49:15,598 --> 00:49:18,167
you had that.

37
00:49:18,192 --> 00:49:22,316
I wish you all could read Amrutanubhava
in English,

38
00:49:22,341 --> 00:49:28,342
understanding how He describes
a realized soul,

39
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:32,496
and you'll find that within yourself
it has happened.

40
00:49:32,541 --> 00:49:36,113
You are different from others very much.

41
00:49:36,138 --> 00:49:46,255
You'll be amazed how you have got
such beautiful description of your Self.

42
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:53,331
I was talking about Maharashtrians;
they are extremely talented people.

43
00:49:53,356 --> 00:49:59,568
See their music. In music no-one can
beat them.

44
00:49:59,593 --> 00:50:04,752
See their drama. In drama no-one can
beat them.

45
00:50:05,629 --> 00:50:10,697
You can see from films. In Maharashtra
only

46
00:50:10,722 --> 00:50:14,492
great films were created.

47
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:20,907
The another one is Bengal, which is,

48
00:50:20,932 --> 00:50:27,278
I would say, different but of the same
level.

49
00:50:27,303 --> 00:50:31,776
It's such a talented people here,

50
00:50:31,801 --> 00:50:37,505
it shows that God has a special blessing
for these two,

51
00:50:37,530 --> 00:50:43,562
and, should be, Maharashtrians should rise
very high.

52
00:50:43,587 --> 00:50:48,880
But all the time complaining about others,
talking ill of others,

53
00:50:48,905 --> 00:50:52,520
and something very low they do.
I'm surprised that,

54
00:50:52,555 --> 00:50:58,920
I hope you don't pick up anything from them.

55
00:50:58,945 --> 00:51:07,523
And also the fussiness that is of the North
Indians;

56
00:51:07,548 --> 00:51:11,387
that's also not a very good thing.

57
00:51:11,412 --> 00:51:17,451
It's surprising how you people have adjusted
yourself to this country,

58
00:51:17,476 --> 00:51:22,317
which has all kinds of parasites.

59
00:51:22,342 --> 00:51:29,794
Because you live with vibrations, you feel
the vibrations.

60
00:51:29,819 --> 00:51:34,442
It's something so great to see you all here,

61
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:41,490
and I'm telling them that they should try
to understand you people.

62
00:51:41,515 --> 00:51:48,051
Really I’m very proud of you all who have
come all the way here.

63
00:51:48,076 --> 00:51:57,957
In this puja I am thinking of so many great
saints who were born,

64
00:51:57,982 --> 00:52:04,706
who were great gurus, mahagurus. Of course
Gyanesha,

65
00:52:04,731 --> 00:52:15,317
I must say, is the king of all those high,
highly evolved souls, no doubt.

66
00:52:15,342 --> 00:52:23,286
So we are now having a puja on the twenty
-fourth of December

67
00:52:23,320 --> 00:52:28,861
because it's a Datta Jayanti, Dattatreya's
birth.

68
00:52:28,886 --> 00:52:32,651
And so we'll be having on the twenty-fourth
night.

69
00:52:32,676 --> 00:52:38,757
In any case it's a Christmas Eve. We could
all start with that.

70
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:45,132
And also Dattatreya, who took His form
in Maharashtra.

71
00:52:45,157 --> 00:52:49,739
Maharashtrians understand Dattatreya.

72
00:52:49,764 --> 00:52:55,503
They understand the Nath Panthis.
These Nathas went all over.

73
00:52:55,528 --> 00:53:04,508
They went to Kiev. You'll be amazed,
they went even up to Bolivia,

74
00:53:04,533 --> 00:53:12,926
those who are from Maharashtra, from Rahuri.
Can you imagine?

75
00:53:12,951 --> 00:53:17,366
Such great people they were,

76
00:53:17,391 --> 00:53:22,879
and that is what I expect to happen
in this Maharashtra.

77
00:53:22,904 --> 00:53:30,740
And I'm sure one day I'll be very much
happy with all of them; not few.

78
00:53:30,765 --> 00:53:34,809
There are some very great Maharashtrians,
no doubt,

79
00:53:34,835 --> 00:53:41,784
but all of them have to join together
because I talk of synthesis,

80
00:53:41,809 --> 00:53:45,053
not of divisive method.

81
00:53:45,078 --> 00:53:51,352
I hope they understand the inner feeling
that I have,

82
00:53:51,377 --> 00:54:00,576
otherwise all the good diamonds will be
selected

83
00:54:00,601 --> 00:54:05,844
and the ones which are defective will be
thrown away.

84
00:54:07,337 --> 00:54:14,326
What's the use? But all of them are capable
of achieving any height.

85
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:17,885
They may belong to any caste, community,
doesn't matter;

86
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:21,913
but they are born in Maharashtra,

87
00:54:21,938 --> 00:54:26,273
which is such a great country.

88
00:54:26,298 --> 00:54:29,468
So today they wanted to do Mahalakshmi,

89
00:54:29,493 --> 00:54:33,283
this thing, we already have Mahalakshmi
temple.

90
00:54:33,308 --> 00:54:38,352
And they have a great blessing of Mahalakshmi
also, in a way,

91
00:54:38,377 --> 00:54:43,880
but they lack: one is the wisdom,

92
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:49,740
and the second the spirit of Kartikeya.

93
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:58,421
The spirit of Kartikeya - that

94
00:55:02,587 --> 00:55:09,254
pure, absolute dynamism

95
00:55:10,053 --> 00:55:17,608
which doesn't indulge into nonsensical things
and useless things;

96
00:55:17,633 --> 00:55:23,662
which shows results.
May God bless you all!
