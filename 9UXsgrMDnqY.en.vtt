00:25:47.482 --> 00:25:52.107
Today we have gathered here

00:25:54.441 --> 00:25:57.316
to do the Devi Puja.

00:26:01.524 --> 00:26:07.232
This Puja was performed many a times

00:26:08.566 --> 00:26:15.107
and the Devi was requested

00:26:17.899 --> 00:26:20.608
by the Devas to save them

00:26:23.065 --> 00:26:30.149
from the  tyranny of devilish people.

00:26:33.566 --> 00:26:38.566
Today I feel the same way,

00:26:39.482 --> 00:26:44.190
that we are now in the grip

00:26:45.232 --> 00:26:51.399
of a funny situation; that

00:26:53.024 --> 00:27:00.107
there are people who are themselves devils, I think,

00:27:01.608 --> 00:27:05.982
--  and also (people who are) mesmerised by them --

00:27:08.274 --> 00:27:15.107
who are trying to do something which they should never have done.

00:27:21.107 --> 00:27:25.899
But they don't know that

00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:31.482
there is a climax of everything.

00:27:32.566 --> 00:27:35.441
And that point has arrived

00:27:37.232 --> 00:27:41.482
where all the good people,

00:27:42.608 --> 00:27:48.024
especially the Sahaja Yogis should put all their mind

00:27:48.524 --> 00:27:54.232
to the destruction of these horrible

00:27:54.982 --> 00:27:58.441
personalities like Mahishasura.

00:28:00.608 --> 00:28:08.107
In those days, it was very simple

00:28:09.441 --> 00:28:13.399
because devils came as devils

00:28:14.566 --> 00:28:19.357
and you could see them, that they are devils,

00:28:20.357 --> 00:28:26.024
and all their behaviour proved that they were devils.

00:28:27.065 --> 00:28:31.232
Why they did it?  Why were they cruel?

00:28:32.107 --> 00:28:37.982
Because so called 'human beings' as they are

00:28:39.107 --> 00:28:44.107
-- they are not -- they are by nature devilish

00:28:45.232 --> 00:28:50.316
and they want to do something by which they can destroy

00:28:51.024 --> 00:28:53.940
human beings, and good human beings.

00:28:58.357 --> 00:29:05.190
It is evident that the time has come

00:29:06.274 --> 00:29:09.149
for them to be destroyed.

00:29:13.566 --> 00:29:18.399
In no way I could be against Islam

00:29:19.524 --> 00:29:23.149
and ever to criticise Mohammed Saab.

00:29:25.107 --> 00:29:30.107
He was divine, no doubt, and tried to do divine work.

00:29:31.274 --> 00:29:36.940
But out of that divine work these stupid people have come up

00:29:38.482 --> 00:29:43.274
who accept those devilish people.

00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:53.065
You will be amazed to know that in Islam

00:29:54.316 --> 00:29:59.232
there are seventy-four groups!

00:30:02.566 --> 00:30:08.024
They say "We follow one religion" -- but they do not.

00:30:11.274 --> 00:30:13.566
Out of these,

00:30:15.441 --> 00:30:19.482
some of them are really evil people,

00:30:22.940 --> 00:30:25.982
and they call themselves

00:30:26.982 --> 00:30:30.899
by the name as Devbandhis because this is a place in India,

00:30:32.608 --> 00:30:35.232
and also they are called as Wahabees.

00:30:37.982 --> 00:30:41.940
I have been knowing them since long

00:30:44.065 --> 00:30:48.024
because in our household, in my father's household,

00:30:49.232 --> 00:30:53.441
we had lots of Muslim people working as cooks,

00:30:54.065 --> 00:30:59.065
as drivers, as other servants.

00:31:00.274 --> 00:31:03.982
And these Wahabees are very interesting people

00:31:04.566 --> 00:31:08.357
because they don't believe even in Mohammed Saab.

00:31:09.608 --> 00:31:11.274
So if you tell them

00:31:11.524 --> 00:31:14.357
that Mohammed Saab has said such-and-such a thing,

00:31:14.608 --> 00:31:17.065
they say "No, we don't believe in Mohammed Saab".

00:31:17.316 --> 00:31:21.274
"So, in whom do you believe?"  "We believe in Allah!"

00:31:21.982 --> 00:31:25.024
"Have you met Allah?  Have you seen him,

00:31:25.524 --> 00:31:27.566
that you are believing in Him?"

00:31:28.399 --> 00:31:32.274
But in their whole behaviour

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:37.065
it was cruelty which was innately built,

00:31:38.524 --> 00:31:44.274
very cruel; and whenever my father saw that,

00:31:44.482 --> 00:31:47.524
he asked them to get out.

00:31:48.524 --> 00:31:53.232
Because (they) always had sinister

00:31:54.524 --> 00:31:59.940
practices by which they used to treat others.

00:32:02.357 --> 00:32:06.566
I never knew that it will come up to that stage.

00:32:08.357 --> 00:32:12.107
And they are mostly they were from Afghanistan,

00:32:12.274 --> 00:32:16.065
can you imagine, mostly.

00:32:16.316 --> 00:32:20.524
Of course they tortured other Afghanis also;

00:32:21.399 --> 00:32:24.024
and where-ever they went

00:32:25.024 --> 00:32:29.482
they had a speciality that they could be very cruel.

00:32:31.940 --> 00:32:37.024
Not all Afghanis, no, not at all, but some of them.

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:41.940
And they came to India from Afghanistan

00:32:42.982 --> 00:32:46.940
and we have different types of Afghanis.

00:32:47.899 --> 00:32:54.357
Some were very loving, kind, helpful, very nice people.

00:32:56.024 --> 00:32:58.566
And some of them were very cruel.

00:33:00.190 --> 00:33:02.482
First we didn't understand what is this.

00:33:03.899 --> 00:33:08.149
But because my father was a scholar and scholar of Islam,

00:33:09.357 --> 00:33:17.274
he told us "These are not Islamic. They call themselves Wahabees

00:33:18.899 --> 00:33:24.608
and they are not Islamic".  I can see that today, so clearly.

00:33:28.608 --> 00:33:32.149
Not that in other

00:33:34.608 --> 00:33:39.608
religions or in other groups there are not bad people.

00:33:41.274 --> 00:33:46.190
But these Wahabees were

00:33:46.441 --> 00:33:50.524
secretly working out different groups.

00:33:52.065 --> 00:33:58.190
They are not many.  And that's what my father had told me

00:33:58.482 --> 00:34:02.940
"One day they will become very explosive

00:34:04.274 --> 00:34:09.566
and they might try to completely ruin the world".

00:34:11.024 --> 00:34:13.065
At first I couldn't understand,

00:34:13.982 --> 00:34:17.274
because, after all, they looked like human beings only.

00:34:19.065 --> 00:34:22.399
But he says, he told me,

00:34:23.065 --> 00:34:26.107
"They are absolutely camouflaged,

00:34:28.566 --> 00:34:32.107
and once they start their cruelty

00:34:33.232 --> 00:34:35.441
you will not know what to do."

00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:40.399
We had one invader in our country

00:34:41.441 --> 00:34:43.940
called as Mohammed Shah Dali

00:34:45.399 --> 00:34:48.482
He was a very, very cruel man, very cruel,

00:34:50.399 --> 00:34:53.190
and he used to even kill the Muslims

00:34:54.024 --> 00:34:57.899
because his concept was

00:34:58.482 --> 00:35:02.149
that you should not worship Mohammed Saab

00:35:04.149 --> 00:35:10.190
because Mohammed Saab said that "I am not Divine".

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:15.232
I also used to say the same, to save from the stupid people.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:18.524
For years I used to say "I am not Divine",

00:35:19.274 --> 00:35:24.566
but when they felt My vibrations and all that, they believed.

00:35:25.608 --> 00:35:29.024
But those who believed in Mohammed Saab

00:35:30.524 --> 00:35:33.190
were never understood by these people.

00:35:35.232 --> 00:35:37.399
Very, very cruel,

00:35:37.982 --> 00:35:41.566
and because they don't even believe in Mohammed Saab

00:35:42.524 --> 00:35:47.524
you cannot argue with them on any point; you cannot argue with them

00:35:48.316 --> 00:35:50.940
what is written in the Koran

00:35:51.357 --> 00:35:53.232
because you don't believe in Koran,

00:35:53.399 --> 00:35:56.482
you don't believe in Mohammed Saab you believe in Allah.

00:35:57.149 --> 00:36:00.399
God knows from where do they have connections!

00:36:02.149 --> 00:36:05.441
But gradually it was surprising that

00:36:06.399 --> 00:36:09.316
they could mesmerise --as we have

00:36:09.482 --> 00:36:14.107
horrible gurus who come as gurus and they mesmerise.

00:36:15.608 --> 00:36:19.482
You have seen them, people being mesmerised.

00:36:20.274 --> 00:36:24.232
So many are being exposed and so many are going to be exposed.

00:36:25.566 --> 00:36:30.232
But mostly they were people

00:36:30.608 --> 00:36:33.232
who were interested in money,

00:36:33.608 --> 00:36:39.441
in getting lots of money, somehow, in the name of religion.

00:36:42.608 --> 00:36:48.566
But at that time, people didn't see their cruel methods

00:36:49.107 --> 00:36:51.357
and their cruelties.

00:36:52.357 --> 00:36:56.482
This cruelty started growing

00:36:57.316 --> 00:37:01.274
and you know we have been to Nizamudhin aulia.

00:37:02.482 --> 00:37:07.232
In that place only I discovered there's a Madharsa --

00:37:07.982 --> 00:37:10.149
'Madharsa' means a 'school'.

00:37:10.982 --> 00:37:16.274
And in that school they used to admit small children.

00:37:18.149 --> 00:37:23.566
And it was so well planned that God doesn't know --

00:37:24.316 --> 00:37:26.316
I mean I can't say,

00:37:27.399 --> 00:37:32.566
that there were 120 Madharsas only in Delhi!

00:37:34.608 --> 00:37:37.357
Now nobody knew what they are teaching there,

00:37:38.608 --> 00:37:43.316
what they are mesmerising, how they are doing this.

00:37:46.274 --> 00:37:50.357
It so happened once I went to

00:37:52.316 --> 00:37:55.940
this place, Nizamudhin,

00:37:56.982 --> 00:38:01.482
and there I found people singing songs and all that.

00:38:04.566 --> 00:38:09.566
And I found in them a real feeling for love.

00:38:10.316 --> 00:38:13.190
They felt My love, very much, all of them,

00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:16.274
and they started coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:21.190
But I didn't know there was a Madharsa in that place.

00:38:23.024 --> 00:38:27.899
I asked them "Why is it, here the vibrations,

00:38:28.441 --> 00:38:31.149
Nizamudhin was an aulia (saint).

00:38:32.065 --> 00:38:36.107
And how is that the place doesn't have good vibrations?"

00:38:37.065 --> 00:38:40.190
In between I used to get very bad vibrations.

00:38:41.190 --> 00:38:44.608
So they told me "Mother, there is a Madharsa".

00:38:45.357 --> 00:38:48.441
Now look at the evil, how it works.

00:38:50.441 --> 00:38:55.316
Normally, evil used to work like this, that it would go and

00:38:58.399 --> 00:39:04.482
form some groups, some wars, and kill people.

00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:19.107
They were few people, but they had

00:39:20.441 --> 00:39:23.441
cruelty as their religion.

00:39:24.441 --> 00:39:31.524
Which ever way they lived, they wanted to be cruel.

00:39:35.024 --> 00:39:39.274
In those Madharsas only, they had people who used to

00:39:39.982 --> 00:39:42.608
tell them how to be cruel, how to hate.

00:39:43.524 --> 00:39:47.566
So 'education in hatred' started.

00:39:50.482 --> 00:39:53.482
And that education of hatred

00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.441
was very well woven through these Madharsas,

00:40:00.940 --> 00:40:02.608
all over the world.

00:40:05.608 --> 00:40:09.274
Now, as you know,

00:40:10.399 --> 00:40:14.316
Pakistan and India were always fighting.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:22.441
But this time Pakistanis realised

00:40:23.608 --> 00:40:27.065
that 'If we fight with India in that way

00:40:27.316 --> 00:40:30.065
we will be called as terrorists'.

00:40:32.149 --> 00:40:38.107
So they said "No, we will have no terrorism in our country".

00:40:39.441 --> 00:40:43.065
But they are the ones stupidly --this new fellow

00:40:43.982 --> 00:40:49.524
had sent about 65 scholars, ambassadors,

00:40:51.232 --> 00:40:56.399
to Afghanistan to study in those Madharsas,

00:40:57.107 --> 00:41:00.566
how to become cruel  can you imagine!

00:41:03.399 --> 00:41:06.190
To teach hatred!

00:41:09.274 --> 00:41:12.482
Of course there are many Muslims who are not;

00:41:15.024 --> 00:41:20.065
but if you do not respect Mohammed Saab

00:41:21.441 --> 00:41:23.982
and you are supposed to be a Muslim,

00:41:24.608 --> 00:41:26.566
what will come out of you?

00:41:29.566 --> 00:41:33.024
So, all these wrong ideas grew up

00:41:33.566 --> 00:41:40.357
and Islam got divided

00:41:40.566 --> 00:41:42.608
into many groups.

00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:49.024
It's alright, but to have this kind of a group

00:41:49.524 --> 00:41:52.357
that is against all humanity

00:41:53.316 --> 00:41:56.982
was the most dangerous plan!

00:41:57.982 --> 00:42:03.149
I don't know how many Muslims also knew about it.

00:42:08.149 --> 00:42:13.357
They spread this Madharsa thing all over the world

00:42:14.566 --> 00:42:20.316
and people coming out of that institution

00:42:21.482 --> 00:42:24.940
became very, very cruel people.

00:42:26.316 --> 00:42:30.232
The first cruelty was to the women.

00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:35.190
Women were treated with such contempt,

00:42:37.107 --> 00:42:42.566
and absolutely no respect of any kind

00:42:43.524 --> 00:42:45.399
was given to them.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:54.357
This itself shows that there was no-one to control them.

00:42:57.316 --> 00:43:03.232
It's not written in Koran, it's not described by Mohammed Saab.

00:43:05.065 --> 00:43:10.065
He says "God is merciful;

00:43:12.899 --> 00:43:15.357
He is peace-giving".

00:43:19.107 --> 00:43:23.357
Whatever he did was absolutely divine, no doubt.

00:43:25.357 --> 00:43:30.399
But some of these people, the way they took to satanic forces,

00:43:34.107 --> 00:43:40.357
people started misunderstanding Islam.

00:43:41.940 --> 00:43:44.065
'Islam' means 'to surrender'.

00:43:45.566 --> 00:43:48.482
Those who are surrendered are you people.

00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:54.899
Surrendered means those who have given up

00:43:55.482 --> 00:43:59.357
all their lust, greed and all these enemies,

00:44:00.149 --> 00:44:06.524
and are above normal people.

00:44:08.316 --> 00:44:11.274
Another thing, it was very interesting

00:44:11.608 --> 00:44:14.399
to note that Mohammed Saab had said

00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:20.065
that "At the time of resurrection, you hands would

00:44:22.566 --> 00:44:27.357
speak". That he clearly said.

00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:32.399
Naturally, because it was written

00:44:34.357 --> 00:44:38.482
in a language which was all poetic,

00:44:40.274 --> 00:44:44.441
people can, if they want to, they can twist it.

00:44:47.190 --> 00:44:53.399
But Mohammed Saab never, never could have said

00:45:00.274 --> 00:45:06.024
It's very, very shocking that in these modern times

00:45:11.274 --> 00:45:15.441
that people have taken to such

00:45:18.232 --> 00:45:21.107
crooked ideas.

00:45:23.940 --> 00:45:30.232
But for that, the reason is that

00:45:32.399 --> 00:45:36.107
people also develop resistance for them.

00:45:39.399 --> 00:45:44.399
Jews -- they developed a resistance for them.

00:45:50.357 --> 00:45:54.940
This hatred is responsible,

00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:59.982
and this hatred between both the sides,

00:46:01.232 --> 00:46:06.940
I would say now, is that two different ...

00:46:10.065 --> 00:46:13.482
it's very evident.

00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:23.441
Now, in Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:24.482 --> 00:46:29.608
you believe in complete

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:36.940
innocent, simple existence together.

00:46:41.149 --> 00:46:47.065
And that people believe

00:46:48.399 --> 00:46:54.399
that there is definitely different groups of people. ......

00:47:03.524 --> 00:47:09.357
Now what is our duty?  What are we supposed to do?

00:47:11.482 --> 00:47:16.149
First of all, we have to introspect.

00:47:17.149 --> 00:47:20.940
Supposing you are a Hindu, born,

00:47:23.065 --> 00:47:26.399
you should sit down and find out if you hate

00:47:26.608 --> 00:47:29.232
anybody because he's a Muslim.

00:47:31.190 --> 00:47:32.608
You can't hate!

00:47:34.107 --> 00:47:37.107
Because somebody is a Muslim, you can't hate him.

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:42.274
Because you are a Muslim, because you are surrendered,

00:47:44.608 --> 00:47:48.482
so how can you hate anyone?

00:47:55.024 --> 00:48:00.065
If you are surrendered, you are surrendered to the Divine,

00:48:01.232 --> 00:48:05.608
and how can you then be against the Divine?

00:48:08.065 --> 00:48:12.190
So these misleading thoughts

00:48:13.441 --> 00:48:16.524
and ideas should be given up.

00:48:25.566 --> 00:48:29.024
Supposing you are a Hindu --

00:48:32.399 --> 00:48:36.274
so you have no business to hate anyone!

00:48:40.065 --> 00:48:42.232
That is for definite!

00:48:42.441 --> 00:48:46.524
Now the word 'Hindu' also comes from the River Sindhu

00:48:47.940 --> 00:48:53.482
because Alexander couldn't say 'Sindhu' so he said 'Hindu'.

00:48:55.316 --> 00:49:00.524
And on that point many people have built

00:49:01.316 --> 00:49:09.190
this horrible hatred in India.

00:49:11.149 --> 00:49:16.274
But cruelty was not their theme.

00:49:18.608 --> 00:49:26.316
That was the saving point.  That they didn't want to torture people.

00:49:28.899 --> 00:49:34.524
So this aptitude to torture or to hate people

00:49:35.149 --> 00:49:40.065
is coming form other sources.

00:49:41.107 --> 00:49:43.899
And the source is,

00:49:46.940 --> 00:49:52.608
as you can see clearly, that they openly hate.

00:49:55.357 --> 00:49:58.482
To hate is a very bad quality.

00:49:59.482 --> 00:50:03.149
One of the most dangerous things is to hate.

00:50:04.482 --> 00:50:07.232
And so you all must know ......

00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:19.524
alright. Now we are having a ...

00:50:40.982 --> 00:50:45.316
To me, it is very painful

00:50:47.024 --> 00:50:51.107
to think that we human beings,

00:50:52.149 --> 00:50:54.482
(that) we hate others,

00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:02.274
when you know that love is such an overwhelming,

00:51:03.065 --> 00:51:06.566
beautiful feeling.

00:51:09.566 --> 00:51:14.482
But why then do you take to hatred?

00:51:20.107 --> 00:51:24.316
Because people have

00:51:26.281 --> 00:51:30.906
impressed you, they have told you lies,

00:51:32.399 --> 00:51:36.399
that's why you hate.  What an achievement!

00:51:37.149 --> 00:51:42.524
First to be a human being, and then to be a person full of hatred!

00:51:44.441 --> 00:51:47.316
Now what will be the next, I don't know!

00:51:50.107 --> 00:51:54.065
It was alright in those days for the Goddess to kill.

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:03.482
The Goddess used to kill all such people  ...

00:52:15.316 --> 00:52:19.482
It's a very sad feeling

00:52:20.982 --> 00:52:24.608
that God has created human beings

00:52:25.524 --> 00:52:32.524
from amoeba to this stage, and how can we hate someone --

00:52:37.441 --> 00:52:40.107
and this is what has happened!

00:52:43.024 --> 00:52:45.524
Now of course Sahaj is different.

00:52:47.065 --> 00:52:51.065
The Sahajis know how to enjoy love.

00:52:54.608 --> 00:52:57.190
They like it.

00:52:57.441 --> 00:53:01.524
They enjoy it. You can see that.

00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:10.566
And if somehow, you people

00:53:11.566 --> 00:53:14.566
could manage to remove this hatred --

00:53:20.482 --> 00:53:25.399
somehow, somehow -- with your own will-power --

00:53:27.316 --> 00:53:33.107
denying and defying all that is being told to human beings,

00:53:35.065 --> 00:53:37.524
I am sure ....

00:53:44.107 --> 00:53:48.316
It's a very difficult work

00:53:49.482 --> 00:53:52.274
where those people who came

00:53:53.065 --> 00:53:55.940
on this earth went through all kinds of

00:53:56.524 --> 00:54:00.566
education, wanted

00:54:02.399 --> 00:54:09.274
to improve the conditions, the relationships, friendships,

00:54:10.274 --> 00:54:16.232
have fallen into the depths of hatred ...

00:54:34.274 --> 00:54:37.899
My heart just weeps.

00:54:41.274 --> 00:54:45.107
At what time I have come on this earth,

00:54:46.274 --> 00:54:51.149
where I have to see human beings hating each other.

00:54:56.065 --> 00:54:59.316
They talk of 'love' and 'hate'.

00:55:02.274 --> 00:55:04.482
It's a very serious thing,

00:55:06.190 --> 00:55:11.190
that you who are the children ...

00:55:14.232 --> 00:55:17.232
they'll end up like this ...

00:55:30.232 --> 00:55:35.441
I mean, I have experiences that if I tell you you'll be shocked.

00:55:37.149 --> 00:55:44.940
How people have fallen down to the depth of evil nature.

00:55:49.107 --> 00:55:54.608
It's an understanding

00:55:58.316 --> 00:56:02.940
we have, to have understanding

00:56:05.107 --> 00:56:09.566
about ourselves: Do we hate somebody?

00:56:10.399 --> 00:56:15.441
Do we get ideas that we shouldn't have, or do things? ...

00:56:17.524 --> 00:56:22.608
Do you have such things in you?  Just find out!

00:56:24.107 --> 00:56:27.441
Do you hate other people?

00:56:36.566 --> 00:56:43.982
The ideas are rotten, absolutely, for the human mind.

00:56:46.566 --> 00:56:51.482
The ideas which are completely

00:56:54.065 --> 00:56:57.065
like the animals' instinct,

00:56:58.482 --> 00:57:03.316
are absolutely no good for human beings at all.

00:57:04.357 --> 00:57:09.107
But that is what is happening, and it's coming forward ...

00:57:15.940 --> 00:57:20.232
If you are poor, alright,

00:57:21.190 --> 00:57:26.399
but by hating you don't become rich, no.

00:57:29.399 --> 00:57:34.608
If you are in any difficulties,

00:57:37.441 --> 00:57:43.357
then your duty is to remove those difficulties,

00:57:44.107 --> 00:57:46.608
but not to prosper on them.

00:57:49.399 --> 00:57:51.940
All this has to finish.

00:57:54.149 --> 00:57:59.065
It is very surprising that we are not bothered at all

00:57:59.566 --> 00:58:02.232
as to what we are doing.

00:58:06.524 --> 00:58:10.899
Yes, you have to have proper

00:58:11.899 --> 00:58:15.357
sense of understanding:

00:58:20.024 --> 00:58:22.441
where are we going?

00:58:27.065 --> 00:58:32.190
If  you have misunderstanding about somebody,

00:58:32.608 --> 00:58:35.232
better take it out, completely.

00:58:39.149 --> 00:58:41.065
They try to trouble you, alright.

00:58:41.274 --> 00:58:47.316
But don't have bad understanding about that person.

00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:57.065
Very surprising that we never see those things,

00:58:58.065 --> 00:59:03.899
how ugly they are, and how funny they are,

00:59:04.065 --> 00:59:06.441
how they ruin our personality.

00:59:11.065 --> 00:59:16.190
You may be able to correct some people ...

00:59:35.316 --> 00:59:40.399
All our activities as Sahaja Yogis,

00:59:41.566 --> 00:59:46.065
I never realised were so important!

00:59:48.357 --> 00:59:51.065
We have to give so much time.

00:59:56.024 --> 00:59:59.608
Not to bother about nonsensical, frivolous things,

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:05.441
but something serious that is within us or without,

01:00:06.441 --> 01:00:08.608
that must be taken out..

01:00:14.982 --> 01:00:20.065
If I ask you, 'How many people you hate?'

01:00:21.024 --> 01:00:28.190
You may say '20 people' and ...

01:00:48.399 --> 01:00:56.232
You see the whole atmosphere in all this

01:00:57.190 --> 01:01:01.566
fills me with such remorse

01:01:03.065 --> 01:01:08.982
that I just don't know what are we going to do, the Sahaja Yogis.

01:01:14.190 --> 01:01:16.566
What are their plans?

01:01:18.107 --> 01:01:23.024
Will you please look into yourself

01:01:24.357 --> 01:01:31.065
and think what constructive work we are doing

01:01:32.149 --> 01:01:36.024
and what destructive work we have been doing.

01:01:38.399 --> 01:01:41.357
You need a big shock to understand this.

01:01:44.482 --> 01:01:50.065
I like the way we have programmes and Pujas and all that,

01:01:50.608 --> 01:01:53.482
but if you ask My Inner Being,

01:01:55.024 --> 01:01:59.232
I know it is very, very unhappy, very sick.

01:02:01.608 --> 01:02:07.524
At this time, what you have to do as Sahaja Yogis ...

01:02:12.441 --> 01:02:16.940
as Sahaja Yogis, minimum of minimum

01:02:17.316 --> 01:02:19.940
you should put full attention.

01:02:23.274 --> 01:02:28.357
And then you have to tell everybody ...

01:02:30.482 --> 01:02:34.232
You see the trouble with Sahaja Yoga is

01:02:35.107 --> 01:02:38.107
that you all start enjoying yourself,

01:02:39.357 --> 01:02:43.149
and then you don't see around what is happening.

01:02:46.024 --> 01:02:49.940
Now I must tell you

01:02:51.107 --> 01:02:57.940
I am now in the midst of war

01:02:59.482 --> 01:03:02.274
between myth ...

01:03:06.441 --> 01:03:12.899
Is it an area, is it a --

01:03:14.441 --> 01:03:18.357
I don't know what should I say --is it (that)

01:03:20.065 --> 01:03:24.316
within us there is still lurking

01:03:26.566 --> 01:03:30.608
some kind of a weakness

01:03:32.149 --> 01:03:39.149
that we do not try to fight our weakness ...

01:03:45.940 --> 01:03:51.190
I would now request you all to meditate

01:03:53.399 --> 01:03:56.232
on yourself,

01:03:58.566 --> 01:04:04.940
and see for yourself what is wrong. ...

01:04:12.982 --> 01:04:19.024
It's a big shock,

01:04:22.274 --> 01:04:28.149
and to reduce this shock, what can Sahaja Yogis do?

01:04:31.149 --> 01:04:39.065
What can they work it out to blast this horrible

01:04:43.899 --> 01:04:46.107
ways of human life?

01:04:49.482 --> 01:04:54.608
It's possible with the Power of Love --

01:04:56.232 --> 01:04:58.482
you can manage!

01:04:59.982 --> 01:05:03.608
But we must develop that power in our hearts.

01:05:05.899 --> 01:05:12.065
Think of it!  It's a big lesson now for all of us,

01:05:13.940 --> 01:05:16.357
to see for ourselves --

01:05:17.399 --> 01:05:22.274
are we alright?  Or we go on hating others?

01:05:26.399 --> 01:05:33.274
What is the function of our mind, is to hate or to love?

01:05:35.524 --> 01:05:40.940
And this love, if it enlightens you,

01:05:42.357 --> 01:05:46.065
you will be amazed, you will be such a big force for Me.

01:05:48.399 --> 01:05:51.482
I cannot fight the whole thing alone.

01:05:52.149 --> 01:05:55.232
I have to have people who really

01:05:58.274 --> 01:06:05.190
develop their love -- and nothing else!

01:06:07.608 --> 01:06:12.232
That is one of the challenges now for all of us,

01:06:12.982 --> 01:06:16.940
for all the Sahaja Yogis all over the world.

01:06:18.982 --> 01:06:26.608
It's not only the fight between believers and non-believers,

01:06:27.899 --> 01:06:35.441
not only the fight between Sahaja Yogis and non-Sahaja Yogis,

01:06:38.982 --> 01:06:45.149
but this is a fight where we are all one

01:06:46.399 --> 01:06:49.316
and we are going to fight it out.

01:06:50.608 --> 01:06:56.190
At every stage we have to be much more subtler.

01:07:03.190 --> 01:07:10.274
It is very, very essential to see to the point today --

01:07:11.190 --> 01:07:18.024
are we also part and parcel of that evil thing that is working out?

01:07:18.566 --> 01:07:23.399
Or are we free from that,

01:07:24.190 --> 01:07:27.399
and prepared to fight it?

01:07:32.608 --> 01:07:37.899
It's a big fight and I hope it is conclusive!.

01:07:39.524 --> 01:07:45.316
After this there will be no more of

01:07:47.065 --> 01:07:49.399
cruelties to human beings,

01:07:52.065 --> 01:07:54.482
no more fights,

01:07:56.441 --> 01:08:02.524
because this is a fight between the rakshasas

01:08:03.357 --> 01:08:09.482
and ourselves.  It is not 'ordinary'.

01:08:12.232 --> 01:08:14.399
And this has to be explained,

01:08:15.316 --> 01:08:19.357
also to those who are supportive of evil forces.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:28.899
Only thing, 'Mother how are we to know

01:08:29.274 --> 01:08:31.566
who is against and who is not?'

01:08:32.566 --> 01:08:38.024
You are knowledgeable; you are Sahaja Yogis,

01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:46.190
you know who is on the wrong side.

01:08:49.482 --> 01:08:52.107
I know Sahaja Yogis can save,

01:08:53.399 --> 01:08:58.482
and can bring them to the right path of knowledge and love.

01:08:59.982 --> 01:09:05.274
But -- be very careful with the propaganda

01:09:06.441 --> 01:09:09.232
of evil that is going on.

01:09:12.524 --> 01:09:17.149
I want to touch the deepest part of your heart,

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.608
which should reconcile ...

01:09:27.316 --> 01:09:32.524
I am sure you all will understand

01:09:33.232 --> 01:09:37.566
the magnitude of danger that awaits!

01:09:39.566 --> 01:09:44.482
Maybe there may not be any human beings left,

01:09:45.608 --> 01:09:49.482
maybe there may not be any children left.

01:09:51.190 --> 01:09:55.107
Because if this kind of thing is working out,

01:09:57.065 --> 01:10:00.107
it is very difficult, very difficult  ...

01:10:15.524 --> 01:10:17.566
My whole existence

01:10:19.441 --> 01:10:24.441
gets shaky, gets shaken up.

01:10:26.107 --> 01:10:30.357
You all should see in every

01:10:31.107 --> 01:10:33.982
nook and corner of life:

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:40.608
Where is this talk going on?  Where are people talking of cruelty?

01:10:41.274 --> 01:10:46.232
What's happening? ...

01:10:59.399 --> 01:11:04.149
Whatever I think ...

01:11:10.357 --> 01:11:15.441
it's not one, it's not two, it's all of us.   ...

01:11:31.441 --> 01:11:38.065
The fight that I am having is of a very serious nature, no doubt.

01:11:39.107 --> 01:11:45.274
But if you all can fight collectively, how much

01:11:46.441 --> 01:11:48.107
we can work it out! ...

01:12:02.190 --> 01:12:06.107
My all efforts,

01:12:08.024 --> 01:12:11.899
understandings, powers,

01:12:12.608 --> 01:12:16.065
everything is now in your hands,

01:12:18.566 --> 01:12:22.232
and that's what you should be prepared for.

01:12:23.482 --> 01:12:29.566
Not by just reading something or

01:12:31.065 --> 01:12:34.399
talking about it, you have to build up within yourself

01:12:35.065 --> 01:12:37.274
the power of love.

01:12:41.940 --> 01:12:47.149
I am sure with the opening of the Sahasrara you will do.

01:12:48.065 --> 01:12:53.232
But try to read something, to understand something,

01:12:54.024 --> 01:12:56.232
with the Power of Love.

01:12:57.524 --> 01:13:01.441
It's a very deep subject, and when you talk about it,

01:13:02.024 --> 01:13:04.316
half-way I'm inside, half-way outside.

01:13:05.608 --> 01:13:09.232
But I have to tell you that you all develop this,

01:13:10.482 --> 01:13:17.274
and only that (Power of Love) will form a very strong opposition

01:13:18.149 --> 01:13:21.482
to these 'evil doers' as they call it. ...

01:13:32.232 --> 01:13:36.232
My complete blessings are on you,

01:13:37.566 --> 01:13:43.149
and I want all of you to individually work it out.

01:13:44.441 --> 01:13:47.441
How many people you love, how many people ...

01:13:51.316 --> 01:13:53.441
This you have to find out.

01:14:04.441 --> 01:14:09.316
I hope you people have understood what I want you to do. ...

01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.608
A new generation is coming up  ...

01:14:34.024 --> 01:14:38.940
All of you, all of you, are in My Heart,

01:14:41.982 --> 01:14:44.149
and I love you very much,

01:14:45.482 --> 01:14:47.482
and I want you people

01:14:50.107 --> 01:14:54.190
to come as soldiers to fight with Me.

01:14:59.608 --> 01:15:05.149
I am also told that there are some people who are forming groups --

01:15:05.940 --> 01:15:07.524
extremely negative attitude!

01:15:07.982 --> 01:15:12.024
At this time what we need is complete solidarity.

01:15:14.232 --> 01:15:19.149
So all such people whom you see, tell them to behave themselves!

01:15:20.608 --> 01:15:23.107
No use making them Sahaja Yogis.

01:15:28.107 --> 01:15:36.024
I am sure -- it's really heartfelt -- desire of mine

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:43.065
that you should become really soldiers of love and peace.

01:15:44.316 --> 01:15:50.940
Because that is why you are here, you are born here for that.

01:15:53.065 --> 01:15:55.107
So enjoy yourself.
