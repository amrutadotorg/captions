00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:36.070
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.230
as well as your own Kundalini.

00:05:46.848 --> 00:05:52.950
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.779
about your own Kundalini,

00:05:55.804 --> 00:06:00.214
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

00:06:00.331 --> 00:06:07.102
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge is this, your own Kundalini

00:06:07.237 --> 00:06:15.728
because, when she rises, she points it out, what are the problems on your chakras.

00:06:16.931 --> 00:06:20.978
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:25.444
but we do not know what purity means.

00:06:26.274 --> 00:06:29.269
It means your chaste desire.

00:06:31.226 --> 00:06:38.526
It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it.

00:06:39.511 --> 00:06:45.632
That power is your own Mother and is settled in your triangular bone.

00:06:45.657 --> 00:06:47.790
She’s your own mother.

00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:51.394
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:54.171
She knows everything about you

00:06:54.777 --> 00:07:09.171
and she is absolutely the knowledge — because she’s so pure.

00:07:14.145 --> 00:07:18.310
And, whatever chakras she touches,

00:07:18.795 --> 00:07:24.279
she also knows what's wrong with that chakra

00:07:25.417 --> 00:07:26.924
beforehand,

00:07:30.073 --> 00:07:32.814
so she's quite prepared,

00:07:33.601 --> 00:07:38.731
and she adjusts herself fully

00:07:40.489 --> 00:07:46.771
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

00:07:47.481 --> 00:07:52.771
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:59.811
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

00:08:02.491 --> 00:08:11.135
Now, this Kundalini is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

00:08:11.921 --> 00:08:15.308
and within you, in a human being,

00:08:15.994 --> 00:08:24.045
it is like many strands of energy.

00:08:24.955 --> 00:08:27.213
So it’s like a rope

00:08:28.385 --> 00:08:37.047
and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kundalini.

00:08:38.906 --> 00:08:47.051
In a human being these strands are three into seven — that is twenty-one —

00:08:47.051 --> 00:08:49.291
raised to power hundred and eight.

00:08:50.358 --> 00:08:53.798
But when your Kundalini rises,

00:08:53.823 --> 00:09:00.599
one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

00:09:00.732 --> 00:09:02.209
Only one or two

00:09:04.612 --> 00:09:11.383
because it has to pass through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:16.974
It’s all a spiral throughout

00:09:17.811 --> 00:09:31.062
because Kundalini is a spiral and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

00:09:31.062 --> 00:09:35.342
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

00:09:36.727 --> 00:09:43.422
The outermost nadi is the right side

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:51.662
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi.

00:09:53.798 --> 00:09:59.902
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

00:10:00.587 --> 00:10:06.724
By that, they relax the center.

00:10:07.141 --> 00:10:10.048
By the relaxation of the center,

00:10:12.239 --> 00:10:17.782
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

00:10:19.401 --> 00:10:23.659
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

00:10:24.345 --> 00:10:28.142
then your eyes start relaxing,

00:10:28.142 --> 00:10:31.062
your pupils start dilating

00:10:31.062 --> 00:10:37.217
and your eyes can become like Mine,

00:10:37.281 --> 00:10:40.902
very black, absolutely relaxed.

00:10:40.902 --> 00:10:44.062
So, you can easily see in a person

00:10:44.062 --> 00:10:49.377
how far is the Kundalini. If it has pierced the Agnya,

00:10:49.492 --> 00:10:53.662
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

00:10:54.189 --> 00:10:57.742
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

00:10:59.184 --> 00:11:05.158
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

00:11:06.084 --> 00:11:09.982
love, compassion and attention.

00:11:13.901 --> 00:11:20.586
All these three things are in that energy.

00:11:21.159 --> 00:11:24.630
We know of many energies — like electrical energy,

00:11:24.663 --> 00:11:30.280
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

00:11:30.764 --> 00:11:37.153
But these energies cannot think, they cannot adjust,

00:11:37.383 --> 00:11:40.776
they cannot work on their own.

00:11:43.422 --> 00:11:46.822
They are to be handled by us.

00:11:46.847 --> 00:11:52.417
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

00:11:52.455 --> 00:11:56.220
and knows how to handle itself.

00:11:57.145 --> 00:11:59.910
It thinks.

00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:07.502
If you see a seed being sprouted,

00:12:07.971 --> 00:12:12.868
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

00:12:13.565 --> 00:12:18.342
which knows how to go around the soft places

00:12:18.382 --> 00:12:25.262
and then how to encircle the stones and then how to find its way to the source.

00:12:26.885 --> 00:12:32.862
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

00:12:32.862 --> 00:12:34.902
the way it moves.

00:12:34.902 --> 00:12:43.382
But within you is … a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.

00:12:43.382 --> 00:12:49.302
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

00:12:49.302 --> 00:12:54.902
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

00:12:54.902 --> 00:13:01.622
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

00:13:01.622 --> 00:13:08.182
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

00:13:10.795 --> 00:13:16.062
When people get realization, they do not understand

00:13:16.102 --> 00:13:21.262
that they have to now grow. And why they don’t grow?

00:13:21.302 --> 00:13:25.502
Because they do not ask for these energies.

00:13:25.542 --> 00:13:31.102
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

00:13:31.142 --> 00:13:34.622
“I have to have more compassion.

00:13:35.355 --> 00:13:38.502
My compassion is not all right.

00:13:39.508 --> 00:13:44.102
My concern about others is not all right.

00:13:44.102 --> 00:13:46.782
My generosity is not all right.

00:13:46.822 --> 00:13:54.223
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love”,

00:13:54.705 --> 00:14:01.302
then this energy starts moving,

00:14:01.302 --> 00:14:06.382
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

00:14:06.382 --> 00:14:11.604
But, if you do not want to be

00:14:20.005 --> 00:14:25.068
growing in your awareness, then she … she says,

00:14:25.102 --> 00:14:28.742
“All right, he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:33.877
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored within you.

00:14:33.902 --> 00:14:40.300
I told you, three into seven, that is twenty-one,

00:14:40.325 --> 00:14:43.365
raised to power hundred and eight.

00:14:43.847 --> 00:14:47.933
So what a storage you have within yourself.

00:14:48.806 --> 00:14:55.142
But because of your mundane style of thinking and asking —

00:14:55.142 --> 00:15:03.102
in the beginning, when I started Sahaja Yoga people used to ask for, say, jobs

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:08.373
or for ‘My mother is sick’ or a father is sick

00:15:08.434 --> 00:15:13.369
or they would ask for money or something like that.

00:15:14.921 --> 00:15:20.820
So these wants are not pure wants.

00:15:20.902 --> 00:15:24.062
As we know in economics, they are not pure wants.

00:15:24.062 --> 00:15:30.382
They’re impure wants because they are never satiable in general.

00:15:30.382 --> 00:15:33.862
So this Kundalini that is your Mother,

00:15:33.862 --> 00:15:39.476
she is there to supply you, nourish you, to look after you, to make you grow

00:15:42.912 --> 00:15:48.262
by giving you a higher personality —

00:15:55.517 --> 00:16:00.982
higher personality, wider personality, deeper personality.

00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:09.182
Now, we think if somebody is well read,

00:16:09.262 --> 00:16:11.582
then we think he is a higher personality.

00:16:13.534 --> 00:16:15.622
Sometimes a person who is rich,

00:16:15.622 --> 00:16:17.862
we think he is a higher personality.

00:16:17.902 --> 00:16:23.542
Sometimes we think a person who is very hard working

00:16:23.582 --> 00:16:25.502
is a higher personality.

00:16:25.502 --> 00:16:33.182
Sometimes we think a person who is, I mean,

00:16:33.262 --> 00:16:40.302
some sort of a confusion about religion or something,

00:16:40.302 --> 00:16:43.382
we think he is a higher personality.

00:16:44.492 --> 00:16:49.622
Our ideas about higher personality itself are wrong.

00:16:51.478 --> 00:16:55.262
People are higher because they are spiritually evolved.

00:16:55.262 --> 00:17:01.262
Otherwise, they are not. They go to dogs. Nobody respects them.

00:17:01.302 --> 00:17:04.942
Now we are in Germany and Germany —

00:17:04.942 --> 00:17:14.342
‘germ’ itself means actually ‘Kundalini’. Germ means in Sanskrit, as you call it, ‘ankura’.

00:17:14.382 --> 00:17:20.622
Ankura is the germ. And Germany is the place

00:17:20.662 --> 00:17:27.261
where we can have Kundalini Puja, is something really a great coincidence

00:17:27.292 --> 00:17:32.338
or I think it’s just Paramchaitanya’s arrangements.

00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:42.794
So, to look at a seed, looks like an ordinary thing, nothing special —

00:17:42.916 --> 00:17:49.262
could be very hard nut also — mostly the seeds are in nuts, mostly.

00:17:49.302 --> 00:17:56.934
If they are not in nuts, then they might be having some sheath or something, minimum.

00:17:57.081 --> 00:18:01.768
But you won’t find a seed just hanging from somewhere on a tree.

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:05.223
It has to have some protection,

00:18:05.248 --> 00:18:10.042
some sort of a hardness outside.

00:18:10.548 --> 00:18:17.043
Now, that hardness is there,

00:18:17.277 --> 00:18:22.414
but the germ has a capacity to break that hardness.

00:18:22.677 --> 00:18:27.815
Just imagine a germ, which is such a delicate thing,

00:18:27.862 --> 00:18:30.531
which even if you touch it might break.

00:18:30.596 --> 00:18:39.639
Can break a germ... can break the covering, the hard shell?

00:18:39.664 --> 00:18:43.884
How can it do it? Isn’t it fantastic

00:18:45.255 --> 00:18:48.634
that such a hard shell,

00:18:49.102 --> 00:18:53.742
which we cannot break it with our teeth even,

00:18:53.782 --> 00:18:57.653
can be easily broken by a delicate germ.

00:18:59.205 --> 00:19:05.143
So at that time, what happens

00:19:06.694 --> 00:19:17.462
is the shell itself doesn’t become lively. It doesn’t get life.

00:19:18.575 --> 00:19:28.310
There is no movement of the shell itself, but it moves

00:19:29.022 --> 00:19:37.574
and it opens. So that delicate thing, when it grows,

00:19:38.526 --> 00:19:41.307
then the shell has to break.

00:19:42.342 --> 00:19:47.568
In the same way, this Kundalini, which is a delicate thing —

00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:52.742
if you see a person who is compassionate. “Oh,” they say,

00:19:52.742 --> 00:19:56.302
“Mother, he’s too much a gem, you know.”

00:19:57.218 --> 00:20:01.022
Everybody has sort of a sympathy,

00:20:01.062 --> 00:20:03.571
protectiveness for that person.

00:20:04.102 --> 00:20:09.256
“He’s just, Mother, he’s just compassion, and all. It’s too much.”

00:20:10.828 --> 00:20:16.451
We always feel such a person to be very — a weakling, a weak personality

00:20:17.018 --> 00:20:19.579
and that he should be protected.

00:20:20.260 --> 00:20:25.582
“Oh, Mother, he doesn’t know also how to abuse people. How will he beat anyone?

00:20:25.582 --> 00:20:30.182
He cannot even kill an ant, ant on the road.

00:20:30.262 --> 00:20:32.961
How can he do anything when he’s good for nothing?”

00:20:34.104 --> 00:20:38.102
That’s our concept, because we think

00:20:38.142 --> 00:20:42.593
we should have somebody really a tyrannical person to handle things.

00:20:45.022 --> 00:20:49.458
But just see that in a seed,

00:20:51.451 --> 00:20:58.594
it is that delicate germ grows and breaks the shell.

00:21:01.184 --> 00:21:03.262
In the same way,

00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:14.862
when we become really delicate like a germ

00:21:15.249 --> 00:21:26.582
and then grow in our delicacy and in our beauty of compassion,

00:21:26.582 --> 00:21:32.060
love and knowledge which makes you humble,

00:21:32.816 --> 00:21:35.537
then these shells will break.

00:21:37.299 --> 00:21:40.700
But it’s the other way round, normally.

00:21:41.364 --> 00:21:44.653
In Sahaja Yoga now, we have leaders.

00:21:44.944 --> 00:21:48.265
We’ve had leaders and leaders and leaders.

00:21:49.072 --> 00:21:53.246
Some of them came like tigers.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.702
I didn’t know what to do to them.

00:21:57.783 --> 00:22:03.062
Even tiger can be ridden by the Goddess Kundalini,

00:22:05.551 --> 00:22:11.382
because this love has the power to break any hard nut.

00:22:15.217 --> 00:22:17.702
So what we should ask for

00:22:17.742 --> 00:22:27.062
is that beautiful, soft, compassionate nature,

00:22:27.102 --> 00:22:30.292
and then the Kundalini will supply

00:22:30.586 --> 00:22:33.396
because she only has that.

00:22:37.396 --> 00:22:40.177
Kundalini doesn’t have anything else.

00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:47.542
All her power is of love, nothing but love.

00:22:49.217 --> 00:22:54.038
So how can she give you something she doesn't have?

00:22:54.090 --> 00:22:59.616
Supposing you hate someone, what can she do?

00:22:59.662 --> 00:23:04.010
She can't do anything because she cannot give you powers to hate.

00:23:07.435 --> 00:23:11.597
So what she says, “You hate someone, or you forgive…”

00:23:11.651 --> 00:23:14.087
She gives you the power to forgive.

00:23:15.636 --> 00:23:20.243
Like a sword has to fight a shield, not a sword.

00:23:22.465 --> 00:23:27.539
So the violence, as they say, can only be fought with non-violence.

00:23:28.017 --> 00:23:31.948
In the same way, if we have to grow,

00:23:31.973 --> 00:23:34.762
the Sahaja Yogis have to grow, first of all

00:23:34.787 --> 00:23:39.066
we have to see how softly we talk,

00:23:40.989 --> 00:23:43.552
how kindly we talk,

00:23:45.056 --> 00:23:47.734
how considerate we are.

00:23:53.127 --> 00:23:59.503
Now this is externally, but when you start doing that externally

00:23:59.528 --> 00:24:03.008
the energy starts coming internally.

00:24:03.102 --> 00:24:05.674
You might say, “Mother, even if you think —”

00:24:05.712 --> 00:24:09.628
So that’s our thinking. No, you’re thinking that time.

00:24:10.022 --> 00:24:14.462
For that thinking, the energy will come from Kundalini

00:24:14.462 --> 00:24:17.097
because you’re asking her help.

00:24:21.394 --> 00:24:23.874
Whatever she has, she is willing to give, but

00:24:23.899 --> 00:24:26.737
whatever she does not have, how can she give?

00:24:27.307 --> 00:24:29.883
Now, supposing you want to get angry,

00:24:30.371 --> 00:24:34.374
she hasn’t got the power to show anger,

00:24:37.002 --> 00:24:41.662
so how can she give you anger and temper.

00:24:43.573 --> 00:24:49.205
I mean, sometimes I try, “Let’s see if I can get into ego.”

00:24:51.916 --> 00:24:54.136
How to get, I don’t know

00:24:56.083 --> 00:25:00.913
because this Kundalini doesn’t know what is this ego,

00:25:00.938 --> 00:25:06.742
how to pamper the ego and how to make you fly in the air. No.

00:25:07.949 --> 00:25:12.782
So whatever kind of energy she is, she will give you that.

00:25:13.782 --> 00:25:16.182
So please remember,

00:25:16.182 --> 00:25:24.022
those who try to bring in assertions

00:25:24.062 --> 00:25:28.016
and conditionings and ego

00:25:28.041 --> 00:25:36.302
and all that are not going to grow because they are not getting the energy

00:25:36.333 --> 00:25:41.192
from the Kundalini, but from outside which is absolutely useless.

00:25:50.935 --> 00:26:00.902
So the power of Kundalini is absolute purity, auspiciousness,

00:26:01.965 --> 00:26:08.090
holiness, chastity, self-respect,

00:26:11.068 --> 00:26:12.971
pure love,

00:26:13.713 --> 00:26:21.182
detachment, concern, enlightened attention –

00:26:25.881 --> 00:26:28.105
to give you joy,

00:26:29.726 --> 00:26:34.080
as every mother wants that her child should get the joy.

00:26:36.706 --> 00:26:41.072
Whichever way is possible, she’ll try to give joy to her children.

00:26:41.097 --> 00:26:45.825
In the same way, this Kundalini has only one power —

00:26:47.247 --> 00:26:54.767
how to give joy to her own children – and she does that.

00:26:55.954 --> 00:27:00.702
Supposing — I mean, I don’t know about modern mothers, but normally

00:27:03.752 --> 00:27:08.582
if I would go and say to my mother,

00:27:08.582 --> 00:27:11.742
“Teach me how to be angry,”

00:27:11.782 --> 00:27:15.419
she will say, “You go and cut your nose.”

00:27:18.547 --> 00:27:24.702
If I tell her that, “Tell me how to tell lies,”

00:27:25.457 --> 00:27:29.216
she’ll say, “Go and cut your tongue.”

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:33.982
If I say, “Tell me how to see bad things in others,”

00:27:34.022 --> 00:27:37.311
she’ll say, “take out your eyes is better.”

00:27:40.224 --> 00:27:51.022
All these ideas that we have within ourselves

00:27:53.587 --> 00:27:58.942
make a very big problem for Kundalini

00:27:58.982 --> 00:28:01.409
to enter into your attention.

00:28:03.065 --> 00:28:05.462
Now, people always ask,

00:28:05.502 --> 00:28:07.062
“Mother, how are we to grow?

00:28:07.062 --> 00:28:08.830
What should we do?”

00:28:10.402 --> 00:28:13.041
That’s why I say introspection.

00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.294
There should be introspection.

00:28:18.395 --> 00:28:21.254
“What do I want in this life?

00:28:21.742 --> 00:28:26.942
I should be able to love many more people

00:28:26.982 --> 00:28:29.966
without any lust or greed or expectations.”

00:28:32.707 --> 00:28:34.081
All right.

00:28:35.609 --> 00:28:45.064
Then the floods of abstract love will flow.

00:28:53.117 --> 00:28:58.462
She gives you witness state. She gives you peace.

00:28:59.129 --> 00:29:02.262
How many things she has to give you

00:29:03.512 --> 00:29:05.254
by which

00:29:08.879 --> 00:29:11.370
you become so powerful,

00:29:13.588 --> 00:29:15.899
so very powerful.

00:29:16.262 --> 00:29:18.718
No one can trouble you.

00:29:49.910 --> 00:29:52.586
She gives you security.

00:29:53.411 --> 00:29:56.282
She gives you peace.

00:29:57.298 --> 00:29:59.909
She gives you wisdom.

00:30:05.643 --> 00:30:12.542
But if you want to ask for stupidity, she cannot do it.

00:30:12.582 --> 00:30:16.542
It is impossible. She hasn’t got it with her.

00:30:20.445 --> 00:30:23.995
So every Sahaja Yogi who has to grow,

00:30:24.255 --> 00:30:35.690
must know what is in store with your own Kundalini.

00:30:37.484 --> 00:30:41.720
So now, if you try to do the other way round,

00:30:41.773 --> 00:30:43.902
you jump on the left or the right side.

00:30:45.173 --> 00:30:49.896
Jump on the left side, then you start moving on the left side,

00:30:51.903 --> 00:30:54.693
then you can become anything.

00:30:55.674 --> 00:31:01.872
Whatever we hear about people, the way they murder and rape and this and that

00:31:02.112 --> 00:31:06.731
and all these things start coming in very easily

00:31:07.926 --> 00:31:13.330
because that energy lies beyond the Kundalini.

00:31:16.691 --> 00:31:19.278
Because you move on that side —

00:31:19.303 --> 00:31:21.868
all right, you want bhoots, have them.

00:31:21.893 --> 00:31:23.984
You want diseases, have them.

00:31:24.009 --> 00:31:28.942
You want to indulge into filthy things, have the filth.

00:31:28.942 --> 00:31:31.966
Whatever you want, you can have it.

00:31:32.017 --> 00:31:34.892
Also, that is available.

00:31:36.589 --> 00:31:38.349
Nobody can stop you.

00:31:40.389 --> 00:31:41.982
You want to be sly,

00:31:42.022 --> 00:31:47.182
you want to be talking behind the backs, all right go ahead.

00:31:47.182 --> 00:31:49.182
This is also very common.

00:31:49.207 --> 00:31:51.858
I’ve heard that the Sahaja Yogis, specially ladies,

00:31:51.883 --> 00:31:56.102
go on talking behind about others, discussing.

00:31:56.142 --> 00:31:59.062
This is how we can never grow.

00:32:00.536 --> 00:32:04.022
If you have to talk, only talk good about others.

00:32:06.168 --> 00:32:08.942
Otherwise, don’t talk, best is.

00:32:12.614 --> 00:32:16.495
These things are not going to help us.

00:32:16.821 --> 00:32:22.454
Now we are not here in this world, at this stage,

00:32:22.579 --> 00:32:28.105
to build them more churches or temples or mosques. No — had enough of them,

00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:32.047
had enough of problems.

00:32:32.412 --> 00:32:37.070
So now we want to make for ourselves

00:32:37.101 --> 00:32:40.836
abode of love and purity,

00:32:40.881 --> 00:32:43.687
but those who are residents are not,

00:32:43.935 --> 00:32:46.782
then how can you have love?

00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:54.462
It will be always jealousies and selfishness and all those things there.

00:32:56.181 --> 00:32:59.422
So when we talk of the light of the Kundalini,

00:33:01.276 --> 00:33:11.102
we have to understand that this light spreads in your life,

00:33:11.816 --> 00:33:16.582
outside your life and expresses itself

00:33:16.622 --> 00:33:19.582
in a very, very beautiful manner.

00:33:21.178 --> 00:33:25.817
Everyone says that Sahaja Yogis look very different from others.

00:33:25.842 --> 00:33:30.982
“There's a glow on their face. There’s a … they look like flowers”,

00:33:31.022 --> 00:33:36.772
so many, “Relaxed. They’re very beautiful people”.

00:33:36.874 --> 00:33:40.462
For example, in Cabella people were so impressed.

00:33:40.462 --> 00:33:45.009
They said “These are young people and they have come here,

00:33:45.034 --> 00:33:49.190
they’re not fighting among themselves, there are no hooligans among them”.

00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:53.685
They’re quite surprised how could you be so sensible, so many of you.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.950
So many people if they gather anywhere,

00:33:57.030 --> 00:34:01.740
they can go amok in no time.

00:34:02.390 --> 00:34:06.110
I mean, even a smaller group

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:07.969
can become mad.

00:34:08.059 --> 00:34:10.859
For no rhyme and reason they go mad.

00:34:13.347 --> 00:34:21.022
So this collective behavior of yours was so much seen clearly

00:34:22.021 --> 00:34:25.101
by those simple village people.

00:34:29.254 --> 00:34:33.840
For that, you have to just desire.

00:34:36.263 --> 00:34:38.418
You just have to desire

00:34:38.510 --> 00:34:43.350
and this pure desire works out in the right direction,

00:34:43.390 --> 00:34:46.150
otherwise whatever you desire you can’t get it.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:47.830
You want money? All right, have it.

00:34:47.870 --> 00:34:49.689
Move to the right side.

00:34:49.714 --> 00:34:53.510
Get money this way. Get money that way. Do what you like.

00:34:55.470 --> 00:34:59.100
Then you want to kill somebody. All right, get to the right side.

00:35:00.404 --> 00:35:04.798
You can get many people who will go and kill anybody they want to.

00:35:05.368 --> 00:35:08.720
Then you want some publicity or something.

00:35:08.745 --> 00:35:11.083
All right, get to the right side.

00:35:14.773 --> 00:35:20.166
All these things can happen,

00:35:20.303 --> 00:35:22.310
whatever you want

00:35:22.378 --> 00:35:26.849
according to the movement that you have.

00:35:29.138 --> 00:35:31.461
But for ascent,

00:35:33.438 --> 00:35:39.377
your desire should be pure desire

00:35:41.483 --> 00:35:46.649
to get to that greater personality

00:35:53.403 --> 00:35:59.017
of love and beautiful relationships.

00:36:01.597 --> 00:36:05.334
Today you’re worshipping your Kundalini.

00:36:05.359 --> 00:36:08.538
You are also worshipping the Adi Kundalini.

00:36:15.744 --> 00:36:19.092
Now, you have to find out

00:36:20.431 --> 00:36:24.977
what are we doing as far as the Adi Kundalini is concerned.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:37.390
When you worship the Adi Kundalini, the reflection in you,

00:36:38.127 --> 00:36:41.441
which is your own Kundalini, feels very happy.

00:36:42.577 --> 00:36:45.270
Also the Deities feel happy.

00:36:45.350 --> 00:36:48.950
In that happy mood, you can achieve

00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:53.750
a very much deeper experience. That’s a fact.

00:36:55.589 --> 00:37:00.448
But, to keep it up, you have to meditate,

00:37:00.473 --> 00:37:04.040
otherwise all these strands will go back, slip down,

00:37:04.893 --> 00:37:07.785
which have come out in the puja.

00:37:08.906 --> 00:37:13.350
I know everyone likes to come to puja, they enjoy it.

00:37:16.736 --> 00:37:20.292
But you should understand that,

00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:24.349
‘what do we get in this puja?’.

00:37:25.631 --> 00:37:31.230
You come here – desire for that higher life.

00:37:33.998 --> 00:37:39.790
But try to get out of this every day-to-day, nonsensical life.

00:37:40.873 --> 00:37:42.750
If you want, you can do it.

00:37:42.750 --> 00:37:44.800
It's again a question of your wanting.

00:37:45.891 --> 00:37:49.470
So throughout it is ‘want’.

00:37:50.852 --> 00:37:52.671
What is your desire?

00:37:57.435 --> 00:38:04.148
We have desire like ‘children’.

00:38:04.912 --> 00:38:07.493
Some people want to have children.

00:38:08.810 --> 00:38:12.011
After the children are born, then they say,

00:38:12.036 --> 00:38:16.630
“Wow, what these children! God save me!”

00:38:19.718 --> 00:38:23.734
Then you want to have money

00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:29.123
and most of those money people are now in jail.

00:38:38.159 --> 00:38:40.983
Then you want to have fame.

00:38:42.934 --> 00:38:48.467
The fame of the people never helps them,

00:38:49.149 --> 00:38:58.515
only it gives you problems because of jealousies and all kinds of things.

00:38:59.225 --> 00:39:01.679
If fame was such a good thing,

00:39:01.704 --> 00:39:03.751
why should people be jealous?

00:39:12.279 --> 00:39:15.918
So the power of Kundalini,

00:39:16.726 --> 00:39:18.941
which is your own mother,

00:39:21.746 --> 00:39:27.992
which has to... which has to rise, which has to come up,

00:39:28.088 --> 00:39:31.001
which has to manifest itself,

00:39:31.917 --> 00:39:35.833
because of your pure desire.

00:39:37.352 --> 00:39:42.270
So in your introspection, in your pujas, in your meditation,

00:39:42.310 --> 00:39:48.453
if you see for yourself why are you meditating –

00:39:48.824 --> 00:39:53.270
it is for pure desire of compassion

00:39:53.310 --> 00:39:56.484
and love to be awakened within us –

00:39:58.601 --> 00:40:01.314
you are already in the meditation,

00:40:01.604 --> 00:40:05.213
you're already growing, the growth has started.

00:40:05.432 --> 00:40:08.983
And you'll grow so fast that this shell,

00:40:09.301 --> 00:40:13.833
which is this human conditioning and egos will just break open.

00:40:15.177 --> 00:40:18.910
And then this small little thing

00:40:18.935 --> 00:40:22.122
which is only in the triangular bone —

00:40:22.357 --> 00:40:27.307
imagine in a... there’s a very little space in the triangular bone —

00:40:27.844 --> 00:40:31.947
that it comes out and manifests

00:40:32.125 --> 00:40:35.000
and can save the whole world.

00:40:35.392 --> 00:40:36.937
Just see

00:40:38.386 --> 00:40:43.068
the magnificence, the expansiveness,

00:40:43.318 --> 00:40:47.412
the greatness of this Kundalini which was within you

00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:51.467
and which came up in its full strength

00:40:51.634 --> 00:40:55.235
and has shown tremendous things.

00:40:57.874 --> 00:41:01.405
Such people are the really great people

00:41:01.536 --> 00:41:07.928
and not the people who are trying to show off

00:41:07.953 --> 00:41:13.217
some sort of a brand cloth they wear, try to show off, no.

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:17.633
All these silly ideas and stupidities

00:41:17.734 --> 00:41:20.663
have to be given up by Sahaja Yogis

00:41:29.318 --> 00:41:37.790
so that this Kundalini wears the beautiful flowers,

00:41:38.827 --> 00:41:42.383
your words become fragrant,

00:41:47.311 --> 00:41:51.266
your glance becomes soothing,

00:41:52.821 --> 00:41:58.354
your smile becomes satisfying.

00:42:00.327 --> 00:42:03.199
Everything, all your being,

00:42:03.224 --> 00:42:09.705
is emitting nothing but goodness, righteousness, peace –

00:42:10.187 --> 00:42:12.565
above all, joy.

00:42:13.866 --> 00:42:18.666
And the joy you feel now — together

00:42:20.249 --> 00:42:23.950
when we were yesterday clapping and singing songs

00:42:23.975 --> 00:42:28.575
and we were feeling the joy at a very simple, simple music concert

00:42:29.401 --> 00:42:33.922
without any drugs, without any shouting, screaming, nothing —

00:42:33.963 --> 00:42:35.761
very simple —

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:41.267
the joy we were feeling, it was because our Kundalini was dancing.

00:42:42.151 --> 00:42:47.443
She was so happy because what were you asking there?

00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:55.630
Nothing but the enjoyment of collectivity.

00:42:57.296 --> 00:43:02.710
Collectivity doesn't mean that we all should be stuck together with some glue

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:07.690
or something or we all become like Gibraltar,

00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:11.302
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

00:43:11.950 --> 00:43:15.714
It means wherever you are, you are connected.

00:43:17.144 --> 00:43:19.050
That is collectivity.

00:43:19.292 --> 00:43:27.219
A connected doesn’t mean that you hate that person. No,

00:43:27.714 --> 00:43:31.069
you’re connected means you love that person,

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:34.902
you’re concerned about that person.

00:43:35.476 --> 00:43:41.733
The connection, the connecting line, is of love and not of hatred.

00:43:42.030 --> 00:43:48.006
So, when you are connected with another person, or persons,

00:43:49.613 --> 00:43:52.659
then you are in collectivity.

00:43:52.775 --> 00:43:58.037
But people will live together and everyday break each other’s heads.

00:43:59.917 --> 00:44:05.187
Some of them really give me headaches, I tell you, sometimes because

00:44:08.102 --> 00:44:14.148
they are nowhere near the real growth of Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:15.938 --> 00:44:20.890
So you may be in America, you may be in India,

00:44:20.915 --> 00:44:22.841
you may be anywhere.

00:44:23.129 --> 00:44:25.062
You are just connected.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.905
And you are concerned.

00:44:28.041 --> 00:44:30.856
As soon as there’s a problem somewhere,

00:44:30.951 --> 00:44:35.576
into any part, any part of the world,

00:44:37.620 --> 00:44:42.590
you are connected and you’re effective, you can manage.

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:48.670
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:54.426
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

00:44:54.991 --> 00:44:59.350
I think people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity

00:45:00.539 --> 00:45:03.269
where there’s not the other,

00:45:03.294 --> 00:45:06.721
ananya, where there’s not the other,

00:45:07.635 --> 00:45:09.974
there’s no other personality.

00:45:12.926 --> 00:45:18.396
These personalities are separated from you

00:45:18.421 --> 00:45:23.461
because of left and right or could be both.

00:45:27.122 --> 00:45:30.176
But you are yourself fully

00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:33.950
when you’re absolutely detached

00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:37.270
and your Kundalini is dancing.

00:45:37.270 --> 00:45:40.481
You're alone and never alone.

00:45:47.171 --> 00:45:50.965
This oneness with the whole

00:45:52.728 --> 00:45:57.490
gives you all the security that you want,

00:45:57.515 --> 00:45:59.458
all the joy you want

00:46:02.125 --> 00:46:08.340
and that's why Kundalini Awakening means collectivity.

00:46:10.051 --> 00:46:17.051
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being,

00:46:17.840 --> 00:46:20.133
Kundalini won't rise.

00:46:21.987 --> 00:46:25.744
I feel sad sometimes when people tell me,

00:46:25.834 --> 00:46:29.624
“This gentleman is like this, this lady’s like this

00:46:29.649 --> 00:46:32.619
and she just says things like that

00:46:32.757 --> 00:46:38.977
and she tries to put down her orders” or some man like that.

00:46:39.228 --> 00:46:42.711
And I really can’t understand what are they doing here.

00:46:45.263 --> 00:46:47.438
We don’t want Hitlers.

00:46:51.143 --> 00:46:58.511
This attitude of ours, so far has been on a different level,

00:46:58.536 --> 00:47:02.750
like acquire more money, acquire more wealth, acquire more houses,

00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:08.264
acquire more cars, acquire more wives, husbands, whatever it is, children.

00:47:09.910 --> 00:47:13.150
But the whole thing changes in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:15.498
You enjoy everything.

00:47:15.693 --> 00:47:18.165
All right, this is your hall,

00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:21.218
doesn’t matter whosoever it … I am enjoying.

00:47:21.243 --> 00:47:24.003
It’s better not to pay for it and enjoy

00:47:26.623 --> 00:47:28.738
other people’s money!

00:47:33.419 --> 00:47:37.042
This carpet is not mine, very good. That’s excellent.

00:47:37.652 --> 00:47:39.794
It’s beautiful, I’m enjoying.

00:47:40.972 --> 00:47:45.070
Maybe the one who has got this, one must be worried about something.

00:47:45.095 --> 00:47:48.582
It might get spoiled or some such thing, but I’m enjoying.

00:47:52.367 --> 00:47:56.392
So when this detachment comes, really enjoy everything.

00:47:57.846 --> 00:48:01.418
And in that detachment only you enjoy others also

00:48:01.458 --> 00:48:05.298
because you are so detached about it, don’t want anything with anyone.

00:48:05.298 --> 00:48:08.298
Only person to person you enjoy.

00:48:09.396 --> 00:48:13.712
That means you enjoy the spirit of another person

00:48:13.786 --> 00:48:17.618
through your spirit, Atmanya Atmanyat.

00:48:17.618 --> 00:48:22.194
It is through the spirit only you enjoy another’s spirit.

00:48:26.413 --> 00:48:29.538
And then the spirit itself is, as you know,

00:48:29.578 --> 00:48:32.022
is the source of knowledge.

00:48:33.037 --> 00:48:40.309
The light of the spirit is the light of love, compassion, forgiveness, everything.

00:48:45.989 --> 00:48:49.578
All that starts shining in through your faces.

00:48:49.578 --> 00:48:51.949
I mean, from faces you can make out a Sahaja Yogi.

00:48:51.974 --> 00:48:54.199
There’s no need to put hands and see.

00:48:54.224 --> 00:48:58.560
You know this is a Sahaja Yogi, can’t be anything else.

00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.033
So the relationship with the Adi Kundalini

00:49:08.058 --> 00:49:13.058
is that it is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini.

00:49:14.542 --> 00:49:18.440
Now the reflection — supposing you take an Indian mirror;

00:49:18.789 --> 00:49:24.965
you look in the mirror and you find you look like nothing on earth,

00:49:25.793 --> 00:49:30.218
it will just cut you into three pieces, maybe, or anything.

00:49:31.755 --> 00:49:34.618
But if you take a Belgian mirror, say,

00:49:35.221 --> 00:49:39.720
then the reflection is correct, full –

00:49:40.178 --> 00:49:43.058
but still not three dimensional.

00:49:43.983 --> 00:49:48.777
But this is a four dimensional reflection —

00:49:48.802 --> 00:49:54.096
four dimensional, what is called as turya state.

00:49:55.176 --> 00:50:01.778
And that four dimensional personality

00:50:04.075 --> 00:50:11.978
you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire.

00:50:13.354 --> 00:50:19.366
The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.

00:50:24.255 --> 00:50:28.739
So when you worship the Adi Kundalini,

00:50:28.872 --> 00:50:32.724
what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kundalini

00:50:32.749 --> 00:50:35.429
as well as please the Deities.

00:50:37.432 --> 00:50:40.461
Because this is an object,

00:50:41.051 --> 00:50:44.667
it is object, it is not to be changed –

00:50:44.778 --> 00:50:48.026
but the reflection can change.

00:50:55.764 --> 00:50:59.818
The movement of Kundalini also depends

00:50:59.858 --> 00:51:02.892
on the temperament of the person,

00:51:04.316 --> 00:51:09.223
what sort of a desire he has for his Kundalini to rise.

00:51:09.503 --> 00:51:12.391
First of all, there are people who doubt.

00:51:13.026 --> 00:51:15.446
They don’t even believe there is Kundalini.

00:51:15.471 --> 00:51:17.460
All right, even if they believe, they say,

00:51:17.485 --> 00:51:20.947
“Oh, the air might be coming out of something else.”

00:51:21.901 --> 00:51:23.875
They don’t want to believe.

00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.739
So it’s dishonesty.

00:51:32.114 --> 00:51:35.778
Kundalini cannot give you dishonesty.

00:51:35.818 --> 00:51:39.138
It can give you honesty and faith in honesty.

00:51:45.744 --> 00:51:51.058
So she gives you faith in goodness, faith in honesty,

00:51:51.058 --> 00:51:56.938
not just by sermon or lecture, nothing by reading Bible or anything,

00:51:57.883 --> 00:52:02.194
but actually by actualizing the experience.

00:52:03.484 --> 00:52:05.894
Now, supposing

00:52:12.232 --> 00:52:13.661
you want

00:52:18.012 --> 00:52:20.325
to go to the garden, supposing.

00:52:20.919 --> 00:52:23.458
Just you want to go to the garden

00:52:24.508 --> 00:52:27.018
and suddenly you find in the garden.

00:52:28.195 --> 00:52:31.720
Then you will know that your desire is pure. That’s why it has worked out.

00:52:31.745 --> 00:52:33.870
“How am I in the garden?

00:52:34.150 --> 00:52:37.658
Has garden walked to me or I have walked into the garden?”

00:52:39.401 --> 00:52:42.618
All such things go on happening within you.

00:52:44.041 --> 00:52:48.635
These are miracles, as they call it, miracles of Sahaja Yoga. Is not that.

00:52:48.718 --> 00:52:53.658
Is the pure desire works it because it is powerful.

00:52:54.221 --> 00:52:56.280
It just works it.

00:52:58.868 --> 00:53:02.000
And when it works it, works the whole thing out,

00:53:02.062 --> 00:53:04.557
you develop that faith within yourself.

00:53:05.226 --> 00:53:09.773
So that faith, if it is within you,

00:53:12.258 --> 00:53:15.826
nobody can challenge that faith,

00:53:16.732 --> 00:53:20.285
which is not a blind faith but an open-eyes,

00:53:20.310 --> 00:53:26.741
experienced faith which is established within you — cannot be challenged.

00:53:27.701 --> 00:53:30.529
If you have the faith, it will be done.

00:53:33.978 --> 00:53:37.771
That’s why I always say don’t say even off-hand things

00:53:37.796 --> 00:53:40.266
because you’re Sahaja Yogis, you are connected.

00:53:41.274 --> 00:53:46.165
If you say, “Let that plane be late,” it will be.

00:53:47.157 --> 00:53:50.240
There is no need to say such things.

00:53:50.551 --> 00:53:53.257
We have had so many experiences like this.

00:53:53.282 --> 00:53:57.054
I have been telling Sahaja Yogis not to say something off-hand

00:53:57.099 --> 00:54:00.040
because you must know you are connected now.

00:54:00.893 --> 00:54:06.262
Your pure desire is now being fulfilled

00:54:06.287 --> 00:54:09.379
and you are now connected, now you are divine,

00:54:09.982 --> 00:54:12.528
you are realized souls,

00:54:13.246 --> 00:54:16.705
you are very different from others. You can’t imagine.

00:54:16.730 --> 00:54:18.930
I can't talk like this to anyone.

00:54:18.955 --> 00:54:22.721
Take any judge, for example, even from France,

00:54:25.513 --> 00:54:29.979
I can’t explain anything to them or talk to them.

00:54:30.004 --> 00:54:32.004
It’s beyond their mind.

00:54:32.029 --> 00:54:37.069
But for you, all this subtle knowledge is just being absorbed

00:54:37.371 --> 00:54:40.491
because your Kundalini’s absorbing it.

00:54:44.767 --> 00:54:50.818
Now, as it is, you know I always perspire too much. Why?

00:54:50.843 --> 00:54:53.723
Because I go on absorbing your heat.

00:54:53.748 --> 00:54:56.404
I absorb so much that I perspire.

00:54:56.429 --> 00:55:01.053
So much, despite the fact that you people are having a nice cool breeze,

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:03.139
and I am feeling hot.

00:55:05.556 --> 00:55:08.908
So this, your Kundalini, also absorbs.

00:55:10.626 --> 00:55:16.050
But whatever you absorb is absorbed back by Me.

00:55:17.162 --> 00:55:21.207
But that becomes like a barometer.

00:55:21.232 --> 00:55:24.581
Immediately you know, “This is this. This is done.

00:55:24.659 --> 00:55:29.052
He’s very hot. He’s like this.”

00:55:29.307 --> 00:55:34.547
You immediately know, without even thinking, without for asking,

00:55:34.572 --> 00:55:37.892
without any desires, you know that this one is like that.

00:55:38.725 --> 00:55:42.226
But the same fellow will be quite friendly with others, is all right,

00:55:42.269 --> 00:55:46.206
but you just can’t stand it because your Kundalini is a barometer

00:55:46.231 --> 00:55:50.631
and she tells you what’s wrong with others, with yourself.

00:55:54.056 --> 00:55:57.208
Now, for example, Agnya is a problem, Agnya.

00:55:57.255 --> 00:56:00.658
Everybody, “Mother, Agnya is a problem. Agnya is a problem.”

00:56:01.498 --> 00:56:03.870
“Yes, I am egoistical.”

00:56:03.969 --> 00:56:07.289
No one says that — means that.

00:56:08.706 --> 00:56:13.983
So you are the one who can know about yourself that is Self Knowledge

00:56:14.008 --> 00:56:16.492
and also you can know about others

00:56:16.517 --> 00:56:20.197
because of the Kundalini’s purity, is the reflector.

00:56:23.673 --> 00:56:29.178
And the more you become a better reflector, the more Kundalini shows.

00:56:33.141 --> 00:56:36.538
So, for us it is important to know

00:56:36.538 --> 00:56:40.378
that our Kundalini’s awakened, that is the pure desire,

00:56:40.378 --> 00:56:42.138
that’s the pure mother of us.

00:56:42.178 --> 00:56:46.938
Each one has got a separate mother, individual mother,

00:56:46.978 --> 00:56:54.818
and that this Kundalini, whichever we have our own separate,

00:56:54.818 --> 00:56:58.138
different from others in a way that she...

00:56:58.178 --> 00:57:03.578
her awareness about us is different.

00:57:03.618 --> 00:57:08.298
But, in her function, in her methods,

00:57:08.338 --> 00:57:11.876
she’s just the same in everyone.

00:57:16.053 --> 00:57:21.338
She, she knows about me, she knows about you, she knows about you,

00:57:21.378 --> 00:57:26.149
so she’s different in a way, in the knowledge,

00:57:26.658 --> 00:57:31.938
but the way that she works in everyone is just the same.

00:57:33.925 --> 00:57:36.738
You wouldn’t find somebody’s Kundalini in the stomach,

00:57:36.763 --> 00:57:38.923
somebody’s in the throat.

00:57:39.556 --> 00:57:41.738
It’s in the same place

00:57:41.738 --> 00:57:46.138
and it moves the same way. It cures the same way.

00:57:46.178 --> 00:57:47.858
It works the same way,

00:57:47.858 --> 00:57:50.978
except that it has the knowledge.

00:57:51.601 --> 00:57:54.935
For example, if you have two Mercedes cars,

00:57:55.535 --> 00:57:58.880
they work the same way — exactly the same.

00:57:58.958 --> 00:58:04.814
But supposing if I have to go from here to, say, Frankfurt,

00:58:04.853 --> 00:58:09.048
then the road is circuitous, so she has to go in a circuitous way.

00:58:10.102 --> 00:58:13.344
But another Mercedes, which has to go on a straight route,

00:58:13.369 --> 00:58:14.972
it will go on a straight route.

00:58:14.997 --> 00:58:17.298
But the working is the same.

00:58:18.207 --> 00:58:22.317
Only the knowledge she has about you in particular

00:58:22.342 --> 00:58:26.036
she knows you very well out and out. Remember this.

00:58:26.100 --> 00:58:27.739
You cannot cheat her.

00:58:30.524 --> 00:58:32.825
She knows you very well

00:58:33.692 --> 00:58:36.789
and that is the reason why today we are here

00:58:36.814 --> 00:58:40.208
to worship our Kundalini, to give her all the credit,

00:58:40.263 --> 00:58:45.741
that “Oh, Mother, You have given us these great powers.

00:58:46.514 --> 00:58:50.270
You have given us this subtle knowledge within ourself.

00:58:51.334 --> 00:58:53.210
You have

00:58:58.243 --> 00:59:02.415
given us the love which encompasses the whole world”

00:59:03.564 --> 00:59:11.690
And the more and the more you become aware of her connections —

00:59:11.784 --> 00:59:14.921
very, very delicate connections —

00:59:17.005 --> 00:59:20.633
then you’ll be amazed. In one of my photographs which came out,

00:59:20.658 --> 00:59:24.714
you must have seen many, many lines going like that,

00:59:26.433 --> 00:59:29.387
but very thin lines,

00:59:31.011 --> 00:59:32.662
sharp, thin.

00:59:33.714 --> 00:59:35.950
This is how we are.

00:59:37.782 --> 00:59:40.940
Now we are all realized souls.

00:59:42.112 --> 00:59:46.042
Only thing, if we have to develop ourselves and grow,

00:59:46.067 --> 00:59:50.231
we have to ask for, desire for,

00:59:51.528 --> 00:59:54.536
something very beautiful.

00:59:56.676 --> 00:59:58.978
But our attention is moving on nonsensical things.

00:59:59.018 --> 01:00:01.140
How will you grow?

01:00:05.138 --> 01:00:07.693
That's why I said we have to meditate

01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:10.771
so we get into thoughtless awareness

01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:16.627
by which we allow the Kundalini to grow.

01:00:21.426 --> 01:00:25.667
I hope after today's program

01:00:25.692 --> 01:00:29.192
people will pay attention to their own Kundalini

01:00:29.217 --> 01:00:32.285
and not to the defects of other people.

01:00:32.415 --> 01:00:34.618
First you must grow

01:00:34.786 --> 01:00:39.866
and develop a personality of that compassion and love and everything.

01:00:41.715 --> 01:00:46.498
Then only you’ll be amazed.

01:00:47.707 --> 01:00:50.805
You’ll grow into something really,

01:00:51.762 --> 01:00:57.842
a beautiful picture of perfection as a human being.

01:01:01.123 --> 01:01:03.834
So may God bless you.

01:01:15.695 --> 01:01:18.965
I didn’t want to go into the details of the mathematics

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:22.299
of three and a half and this and that and this — forget it.

01:01:25.352 --> 01:01:29.899
There’s no need to deal with all those mathematical calculations and things.

01:01:29.924 --> 01:01:31.492
There’s no need.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:35.841
I mean it’s the mathematics of love,
and what is the mathematics of love?

01:01:43.211 --> 01:01:45.198
But I am writing a book,

01:01:45.941 --> 01:01:50.607
if you want to know about it, you can read it later on

01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:52.825
once you have become something great, then,

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:55.174
otherwise it will go into your head again.

01:02:00.469 --> 01:02:02.491
Agnya is too much.

01:02:02.961 --> 01:02:07.390
What is making you so very Agnya?

01:02:09.052 --> 01:02:12.221
I didn't say anything to hurt you, did I?

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:39.709
Better?

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:45.639
I think we all should put our finger to our Agnya

01:02:45.664 --> 01:02:47.498
and move it a little.

01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:57.457
Here we become really thoughtlessly aware and detached.

01:03:02.701 --> 01:03:04.323
Move it slowly.

01:03:20.265 --> 01:03:23.667
Ah, better, much relaxed.
