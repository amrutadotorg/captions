05:27.590 --> 05:36.070
Today we have gathered here to do the puja of Adi Kundalini

05:36.070 --> 05:39.230
as well as your own Kundalini.

05:46.848 --> 05:52.950
First of all, I think this is the most important thing to understand

05:52.990 --> 05:55.779
about your own Kundalini,

05:55.804 --> 06:00.214
as Self-realization is Self-knowledge

06:00.331 --> 06:07.102
and the one who gives you Self Knowledge is this, your own Kundalini

06:07.237 --> 06:15.728
because, when she rises, she points it out, what are the problems on your chakras.

06:16.931 --> 06:20.978
Now, we say that it is pure desire,

06:22.329 --> 06:25.444
but we do not know what purity means.

06:26.274 --> 06:29.269
It means your chaste desire.

06:31.226 --> 06:38.526
It means it has no lust, greed, anything in it.

06:39.511 --> 06:45.632
That power is your own Mother and is settled in your triangular bone.

06:45.657 --> 06:47.790
She’s your own mother.

06:47.815 --> 06:51.394
She knows everything about you, it’s like a tape recorder.

06:51.531 --> 06:54.171
She knows everything about you

06:54.777 --> 07:09.171
and she is absolutely the knowledge — because she’s so pure.

07:14.145 --> 07:18.310
And, whatever chakras she touches,

07:18.795 --> 07:24.279
she also knows what's wrong with that chakra

07:25.417 --> 07:26.924
beforehand,

07:30.073 --> 07:32.814
so she's quite prepared,

07:33.601 --> 07:38.731
and she adjusts herself fully

07:40.489 --> 07:46.771
so that you do not get a problem by her awakening.

07:47.481 --> 07:52.771
If any chakra is constricted, she waits

07:52.811 --> 07:59.811
and goes on slowly opening that chakra.

08:02.491 --> 08:11.135
Now, this Kundalini is the primordial power which is reflected within you,

08:11.921 --> 08:15.308
and within you, in a human being,

08:15.994 --> 08:24.045
it is like many strands of energy.

08:24.955 --> 08:27.213
So it’s like a rope

08:28.385 --> 08:37.047
and these energies are all twisted together to form this Kundalini.

08:38.906 --> 08:47.051
In a human being these strands are three into seven — that is twenty-one —

08:47.051 --> 08:49.291
raised to power hundred and eight.

08:50.358 --> 08:53.798
But when your Kundalini rises,

08:53.823 --> 09:00.599
one or two strands out of this come up and pierce the fontanel bone area.

09:00.732 --> 09:02.209
Only one or two

09:04.612 --> 09:11.383
because it has to pass through the innermost nadi, known as Brahma Nadi.

09:14.390 --> 09:16.974
It’s all a spiral throughout

09:17.811 --> 09:31.062
because Kundalini is a spiral and these nadis are also are like a spiral like this.

09:31.062 --> 09:35.342
So the innermost nadi is the Brahma Nadi.

09:36.727 --> 09:43.422
The outermost nadi is the right side

09:44.400 --> 09:51.662
and the second innermost is the Ida Nadi.

09:53.798 --> 09:59.902
So, through the Brahma Nadi, she starts sending those threads.

10:00.587 --> 10:06.724
By that, they relax the center.

10:07.141 --> 10:10.048
By the relaxation of the center,

10:12.239 --> 10:17.782
the sympathetic nervous system also starts relaxing

10:19.401 --> 10:23.659
and when it goes to the Agnya Chakra,

10:24.345 --> 10:28.142
then your eyes start relaxing,

10:28.142 --> 10:31.062
your pupils start dilating

10:31.062 --> 10:37.217
and your eyes can become like Mine,

10:37.281 --> 10:40.902
very black, absolutely relaxed.

10:40.902 --> 10:44.062
So, you can easily see in a person

10:44.062 --> 10:49.377
how far is the Kundalini. If it has pierced the Agnya,

10:49.492 --> 10:53.662
then the eyes will be completely dilated and will be shining

10:54.189 --> 10:57.742
and then she enters into the Sahasrara.

10:59.184 --> 11:05.158
Now, it is absolutely pure light of knowledge,

11:06.084 --> 11:09.982
love, compassion and attention.

11:13.901 --> 11:20.586
All these three things are in that energy.

11:21.159 --> 11:24.630
We know of many energies — like electrical energy,

11:24.663 --> 11:30.280
we know of light energy, we know of other energies.

11:30.764 --> 11:37.153
But these energies cannot think, they cannot adjust,

11:37.383 --> 11:40.776
they cannot work on their own.

11:43.422 --> 11:46.822
They are to be handled by us.

11:46.847 --> 11:52.417
But this energy, itself, is the living energy

11:52.455 --> 11:56.220
and knows how to handle itself.

11:57.145 --> 11:59.910
It thinks.

12:03.251 --> 12:07.502
If you see a seed being sprouted,

12:07.971 --> 12:12.868
you’ll find at the tip of the seed there’s a small little cell

12:13.565 --> 12:18.342
which knows how to go around the soft places

12:18.382 --> 12:25.262
and then how to encircle the stones and then how to find its way to the source.

12:26.885 --> 12:32.862
That cell has got, I would say, a little Kundalini in it,

12:32.862 --> 12:34.902
the way it moves.

12:34.902 --> 12:43.382
But within you is … a tremendous force of Kundalini exists.

12:43.382 --> 12:49.302
So, you have a storehouse of compassion,

12:49.302 --> 12:54.902
which can be enlightened by the spirit.

12:54.902 --> 13:01.622
You have a storehouse of love, compassion

13:01.622 --> 13:08.182
and knowledge and ocean of forgiveness.

13:10.795 --> 13:16.062
When people get realization, they do not understand

13:16.102 --> 13:21.262
that they have to now grow. And why they don’t grow?

13:21.302 --> 13:25.502
Because they do not ask for these energies.

13:25.542 --> 13:31.102
A person who is a realized soul, if he says that,

13:31.142 --> 13:34.622
“I have to have more compassion.

13:35.355 --> 13:38.502
My compassion is not all right.

13:39.508 --> 13:44.102
My concern about others is not all right.

13:44.102 --> 13:46.782
My generosity is not all right.

13:46.822 --> 13:54.223
I’m exploiting others. I’m exploiting their love”,

13:54.705 --> 14:01.302
then this energy starts moving,

14:01.302 --> 14:06.382
giving you that greater dimension of love and compassion.

14:06.382 --> 14:11.604
But, if you do not want to be

14:20.005 --> 14:25.068
growing in your awareness, then she … she says,

14:25.102 --> 14:28.742
“All right, he is a half-baked Sahaja Yogi, let it be”,

14:29.160 --> 14:33.877
she doesn't supply that energy which is stored within you.

14:33.902 --> 14:40.300
I told you, three into seven, that is twenty-one,

14:40.325 --> 14:43.365
raised to power hundred and eight.

14:43.847 --> 14:47.933
So what a storage you have within yourself.

14:48.806 --> 14:55.142
But because of your mundane style of thinking and asking —

14:55.142 --> 15:03.102
in the beginning, when I started Sahaja Yoga people used to ask for, say, jobs

15:03.102 --> 15:08.373
or for ‘My mother is sick’ or a father is sick

15:08.434 --> 15:13.369
or they would ask for money or something like that.

15:14.921 --> 15:20.820
So these wants are not pure wants.

15:20.902 --> 15:24.062
As we know in economics, they are not pure wants.

15:24.062 --> 15:30.382
They’re impure wants because they are never satiable in general.

15:30.382 --> 15:33.862
So this Kundalini that is your Mother,

15:33.862 --> 15:39.476
she is there to supply you, nourish you, to look after you, to make you grow

15:42.912 --> 15:48.262
by giving you a higher personality —

15:55.517 --> 16:00.982
higher personality, wider personality, deeper personality.

16:03.949 --> 16:09.182
Now, we think if somebody is well read,

16:09.262 --> 16:11.582
then we think he is a higher personality.

16:13.534 --> 16:15.622
Sometimes a person who is rich,

16:15.622 --> 16:17.862
we think he is a higher personality.

16:17.902 --> 16:23.542
Sometimes we think a person who is very hard working

16:23.582 --> 16:25.502
is a higher personality.

16:25.502 --> 16:33.182
Sometimes we think a person who is, I mean,

16:33.262 --> 16:40.302
some sort of a confusion about religion or something,

16:40.302 --> 16:43.382
we think he is a higher personality.

16:44.492 --> 16:49.622
Our ideas about higher personality itself are wrong.

16:51.478 --> 16:55.262
People are higher because they are spiritually evolved.

16:55.262 --> 17:01.262
Otherwise, they are not. They go to dogs. Nobody respects them.

17:01.302 --> 17:04.942
Now we are in Germany and Germany —

17:04.942 --> 17:14.342
‘germ’ itself means actually ‘Kundalini’. Germ means in Sanskrit, as you call it, ‘ankura’.

17:14.382 --> 17:20.622
Ankura is the germ. And Germany is the place

17:20.662 --> 17:27.261
where we can have Kundalini Puja, is something really a great coincidence

17:27.292 --> 17:32.338
or I think it’s just Paramchaitanya’s arrangements.

17:33.083 --> 17:42.794
So, to look at a seed, looks like an ordinary thing, nothing special —

17:42.916 --> 17:49.262
could be very hard nut also — mostly the seeds are in nuts, mostly.

17:49.302 --> 17:56.934
If they are not in nuts, then they might be having some sheath or something, minimum.

17:57.081 --> 18:01.768
But you won’t find a seed just hanging from somewhere on a tree.

18:01.830 --> 18:05.223
It has to have some protection,

18:05.248 --> 18:10.042
some sort of a hardness outside.

18:10.548 --> 18:17.043
Now, that hardness is there,

18:17.277 --> 18:22.414
but the germ has a capacity to break that hardness.

18:22.677 --> 18:27.815
Just imagine a germ, which is such a delicate thing,

18:27.862 --> 18:30.531
which even if you touch it might break.

18:30.596 --> 18:39.639
Can break a germ... can break the covering, the hard shell?

18:39.664 --> 18:43.884
How can it do it? Isn’t it fantastic

18:45.255 --> 18:48.634
that such a hard shell,

18:49.102 --> 18:53.742
which we cannot break it with our teeth even,

18:53.782 --> 18:57.653
can be easily broken by a delicate germ.

18:59.205 --> 19:05.143
So at that time, what happens

19:06.694 --> 19:17.462
is the shell itself doesn’t become lively. It doesn’t get life.

19:18.575 --> 19:28.310
There is no movement of the shell itself, but it moves

19:29.022 --> 19:37.574
and it opens. So that delicate thing, when it grows,

19:38.526 --> 19:41.307
then the shell has to break.

19:42.342 --> 19:47.568
In the same way, this Kundalini, which is a delicate thing —

19:47.810 --> 19:52.742
if you see a person who is compassionate. “Oh,” they say,

19:52.742 --> 19:56.302
“Mother, he’s too much a gem, you know.”

19:57.218 --> 20:01.022
Everybody has sort of a sympathy,

20:01.062 --> 20:03.571
protectiveness for that person.

20:04.102 --> 20:09.256
“He’s just, Mother, he’s just compassion, and all. It’s too much.”

20:10.828 --> 20:16.451
We always feel such a person to be very — a weakling, a weak personality

20:17.018 --> 20:19.579
and that he should be protected.

20:20.260 --> 20:25.582
“Oh, Mother, he doesn’t know also how to abuse people. How will he beat anyone?

20:25.582 --> 20:30.182
He cannot even kill an ant, ant on the road.

20:30.262 --> 20:32.961
How can he do anything when he’s good for nothing?”

20:34.104 --> 20:38.102
That’s our concept, because we think

20:38.142 --> 20:42.593
we should have somebody really a tyrannical person to handle things.

20:45.022 --> 20:49.458
But just see that in a seed,

20:51.451 --> 20:58.594
it is that delicate germ grows and breaks the shell.

21:01.184 --> 21:03.262
In the same way,

21:03.610 --> 21:14.862
when we become really delicate like a germ

21:15.249 --> 21:26.582
and then grow in our delicacy and in our beauty of compassion,

21:26.582 --> 21:32.060
love and knowledge which makes you humble,

21:32.816 --> 21:35.537
then these shells will break.

21:37.299 --> 21:40.700
But it’s the other way round, normally.

21:41.364 --> 21:44.653
In Sahaja Yoga now, we have leaders.

21:44.944 --> 21:48.265
We’ve had leaders and leaders and leaders.

21:49.072 --> 21:53.246
Some of them came like tigers.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.702
I didn’t know what to do to them.

21:57.783 --> 22:03.062
Even tiger can be ridden by the Goddess Kundalini,

22:05.551 --> 22:11.382
because this love has the power to break any hard nut.

22:15.217 --> 22:17.702
So what we should ask for

22:17.742 --> 22:27.062
is that beautiful, soft, compassionate nature,

22:27.102 --> 22:30.292
and then the Kundalini will supply

22:30.586 --> 22:33.396
because she only has that.

22:37.396 --> 22:40.177
Kundalini doesn’t have anything else.

22:40.310 --> 22:47.542
All her power is of love, nothing but love.

22:49.217 --> 22:54.038
So how can she give you something she doesn't have?

22:54.090 --> 22:59.616
Supposing you hate someone, what can she do?

22:59.662 --> 23:04.010
She can't do anything because she cannot give you powers to hate.

23:07.435 --> 23:11.597
So what she says, “You hate someone, or you forgive…”

23:11.651 --> 23:14.087
She gives you the power to forgive.

23:15.636 --> 23:20.243
Like a sword has to fight a shield, not a sword.

23:22.465 --> 23:27.539
So the violence, as they say, can only be fought with non-violence.

23:28.017 --> 23:31.948
In the same way, if we have to grow,

23:31.973 --> 23:34.762
the Sahaja Yogis have to grow, first of all

23:34.787 --> 23:39.066
we have to see how softly we talk,

23:40.989 --> 23:43.552
how kindly we talk,

23:45.056 --> 23:47.734
how considerate we are.

23:53.127 --> 23:59.503
Now this is externally, but when you start doing that externally

23:59.528 --> 24:03.008
the energy starts coming internally.

24:03.102 --> 24:05.674
You might say, “Mother, even if you think —”

24:05.712 --> 24:09.628
So that’s our thinking. No, you’re thinking that time.

24:10.022 --> 24:14.462
For that thinking, the energy will come from Kundalini

24:14.462 --> 24:17.097
because you’re asking her help.

24:21.394 --> 24:23.874
Whatever she has, she is willing to give, but

24:23.899 --> 24:26.737
whatever she does not have, how can she give?

24:27.307 --> 24:29.883
Now, supposing you want to get angry,

24:30.371 --> 24:34.374
she hasn’t got the power to show anger,

24:37.002 --> 24:41.662
so how can she give you anger and temper.

24:43.573 --> 24:49.205
I mean, sometimes I try, “Let’s see if I can get into ego.”

24:51.916 --> 24:54.136
How to get, I don’t know

24:56.083 --> 25:00.913
because this Kundalini doesn’t know what is this ego,

25:00.938 --> 25:06.742
how to pamper the ego and how to make you fly in the air. No.

25:07.949 --> 25:12.782
So whatever kind of energy she is, she will give you that.

25:13.782 --> 25:16.182
So please remember,

25:16.182 --> 25:24.022
those who try to bring in assertions

25:24.062 --> 25:28.016
and conditionings and ego

25:28.041 --> 25:36.302
and all that are not going to grow because they are not getting the energy

25:36.333 --> 25:41.192
from the Kundalini, but from outside which is absolutely useless.

25:50.935 --> 26:00.902
So the power of Kundalini is absolute purity, auspiciousness,

26:01.965 --> 26:08.090
holiness, chastity, self-respect,

26:11.068 --> 26:12.971
pure love,

26:13.713 --> 26:21.182
detachment, concern, enlightened attention –

26:25.881 --> 26:28.105
to give you joy,

26:29.726 --> 26:34.080
as every mother wants that her child should get the joy.

26:36.706 --> 26:41.072
Whichever way is possible, she’ll try to give joy to her children.

26:41.097 --> 26:45.825
In the same way, this Kundalini has only one power —

26:47.247 --> 26:54.767
how to give joy to her own children – and she does that.

26:55.954 --> 27:00.702
Supposing — I mean, I don’t know about modern mothers, but normally

27:03.752 --> 27:08.582
if I would go and say to my mother,

27:08.582 --> 27:11.742
“Teach me how to be angry,”

27:11.782 --> 27:15.419
she will say, “You go and cut your nose.”

27:18.547 --> 27:24.702
If I tell her that, “Tell me how to tell lies,”

27:25.457 --> 27:29.216
she’ll say, “Go and cut your tongue.”

27:30.230 --> 27:33.982
If I say, “Tell me how to see bad things in others,”

27:34.022 --> 27:37.311
she’ll say, “take out your eyes is better.”

27:40.224 --> 27:51.022
All these ideas that we have within ourselves

27:53.587 --> 27:58.942
make a very big problem for Kundalini

27:58.982 --> 28:01.409
to enter into your attention.

28:03.065 --> 28:05.462
Now, people always ask,

28:05.502 --> 28:07.062
“Mother, how are we to grow?

28:07.062 --> 28:08.830
What should we do?”

28:10.402 --> 28:13.041
That’s why I say introspection.

28:14.980 --> 28:17.294
There should be introspection.

28:18.395 --> 28:21.254
“What do I want in this life?

28:21.742 --> 28:26.942
I should be able to love many more people

28:26.982 --> 28:29.966
without any lust or greed or expectations.”

28:32.707 --> 28:34.081
All right.

28:35.609 --> 28:45.064
Then the floods of abstract love will flow.

28:53.117 --> 28:58.462
She gives you witness state. She gives you peace.

28:59.129 --> 29:02.262
How many things she has to give you

29:03.512 --> 29:05.254
by which

29:08.879 --> 29:11.370
you become so powerful,

29:13.588 --> 29:15.899
so very powerful.

29:16.262 --> 29:18.718
No one can trouble you.

29:49.910 --> 29:52.586
She gives you security.

29:53.411 --> 29:56.282
She gives you peace.

29:57.298 --> 29:59.909
She gives you wisdom.

30:05.643 --> 30:12.542
But if you want to ask for stupidity, she cannot do it.

30:12.582 --> 30:16.542
It is impossible. She hasn’t got it with her.

30:20.445 --> 30:23.995
So every Sahaja Yogi who has to grow,

30:24.255 --> 30:35.690
must know what is in store with your own Kundalini.

30:37.484 --> 30:41.720
So now, if you try to do the other way round,

30:41.773 --> 30:43.902
you jump on the left or the right side.

30:45.173 --> 30:49.896
Jump on the left side, then you start moving on the left side,

30:51.903 --> 30:54.693
then you can become anything.

30:55.674 --> 31:01.872
Whatever we hear about people, the way they murder and rape and this and that

31:02.112 --> 31:06.731
and all these things start coming in very easily

31:07.926 --> 31:13.330
because that energy lies beyond the Kundalini.

31:16.691 --> 31:19.278
Because you move on that side —

31:19.303 --> 31:21.868
all right, you want bhoots, have them.

31:21.893 --> 31:23.984
You want diseases, have them.

31:24.009 --> 31:28.942
You want to indulge into filthy things, have the filth.

31:28.942 --> 31:31.966
Whatever you want, you can have it.

31:32.017 --> 31:34.892
Also, that is available.

31:36.589 --> 31:38.349
Nobody can stop you.

31:40.389 --> 31:41.982
You want to be sly,

31:42.022 --> 31:47.182
you want to be talking behind the backs, all right go ahead.

31:47.182 --> 31:49.182
This is also very common.

31:49.207 --> 31:51.858
I’ve heard that the Sahaja Yogis, specially ladies,

31:51.883 --> 31:56.102
go on talking behind about others, discussing.

31:56.142 --> 31:59.062
This is how we can never grow.

32:00.536 --> 32:04.022
If you have to talk, only talk good about others.

32:06.168 --> 32:08.942
Otherwise, don’t talk, best is.

32:12.614 --> 32:16.495
These things are not going to help us.

32:16.821 --> 32:22.454
Now we are not here in this world, at this stage,

32:22.579 --> 32:28.105
to build them more churches or temples or mosques. No — had enough of them,

32:29.059 --> 32:32.047
had enough of problems.

32:32.412 --> 32:37.070
So now we want to make for ourselves

32:37.101 --> 32:40.836
abode of love and purity,

32:40.881 --> 32:43.687
but those who are residents are not,

32:43.935 --> 32:46.782
then how can you have love?

32:47.360 --> 32:54.462
It will be always jealousies and selfishness and all those things there.

32:56.181 --> 32:59.422
So when we talk of the light of the Kundalini,

33:01.276 --> 33:11.102
we have to understand that this light spreads in your life,

33:11.816 --> 33:16.582
outside your life and expresses itself

33:16.622 --> 33:19.582
in a very, very beautiful manner.

33:21.178 --> 33:25.817
Everyone says that Sahaja Yogis look very different from others.

33:25.842 --> 33:30.982
“There's a glow on their face. There’s a … they look like flowers”,

33:31.022 --> 33:36.772
so many, “Relaxed. They’re very beautiful people”.

33:36.874 --> 33:40.462
For example, in Cabella people were so impressed.

33:40.462 --> 33:45.009
They said “These are young people and they have come here,

33:45.034 --> 33:49.190
they’re not fighting among themselves, there are no hooligans among them”.

33:49.190 --> 33:53.685
They’re quite surprised how could you be so sensible, so many of you.

33:54.190 --> 33:56.950
So many people if they gather anywhere,

33:57.030 --> 34:01.740
they can go amok in no time.

34:02.390 --> 34:06.110
I mean, even a smaller group

34:06.110 --> 34:07.969
can become mad.

34:08.059 --> 34:10.859
For no rhyme and reason they go mad.

34:13.347 --> 34:21.022
So this collective behavior of yours was so much seen clearly

34:22.021 --> 34:25.101
by those simple village people.

34:29.254 --> 34:33.840
For that, you have to just desire.

34:36.263 --> 34:38.418
You just have to desire

34:38.510 --> 34:43.350
and this pure desire works out in the right direction,

34:43.390 --> 34:46.150
otherwise whatever you desire you can’t get it.

34:46.190 --> 34:47.830
You want money? All right, have it.

34:47.870 --> 34:49.689
Move to the right side.

34:49.714 --> 34:53.510
Get money this way. Get money that way. Do what you like.

34:55.470 --> 34:59.100
Then you want to kill somebody. All right, get to the right side.

35:00.404 --> 35:04.798
You can get many people who will go and kill anybody they want to.

35:05.368 --> 35:08.720
Then you want some publicity or something.

35:08.745 --> 35:11.083
All right, get to the right side.

35:14.773 --> 35:20.166
All these things can happen,

35:20.303 --> 35:22.310
whatever you want

35:22.378 --> 35:26.849
according to the movement that you have.

35:29.138 --> 35:31.461
But for ascent,

35:33.438 --> 35:39.377
your desire should be pure desire

35:41.483 --> 35:46.649
to get to that greater personality

35:53.403 --> 35:59.017
of love and beautiful relationships.

36:01.597 --> 36:05.334
Today you’re worshipping your Kundalini.

36:05.359 --> 36:08.538
You are also worshipping the Adi Kundalini.

36:15.744 --> 36:19.092
Now, you have to find out

36:20.431 --> 36:24.977
what are we doing as far as the Adi Kundalini is concerned.

36:32.030 --> 36:37.390
When you worship the Adi Kundalini, the reflection in you,

36:38.127 --> 36:41.441
which is your own Kundalini, feels very happy.

36:42.577 --> 36:45.270
Also the Deities feel happy.

36:45.350 --> 36:48.950
In that happy mood, you can achieve

36:48.950 --> 36:53.750
a very much deeper experience. That’s a fact.

36:55.589 --> 37:00.448
But, to keep it up, you have to meditate,

37:00.473 --> 37:04.040
otherwise all these strands will go back, slip down,

37:04.893 --> 37:07.785
which have come out in the puja.

37:08.906 --> 37:13.350
I know everyone likes to come to puja, they enjoy it.

37:16.736 --> 37:20.292
But you should understand that,

37:21.440 --> 37:24.349
‘what do we get in this puja?’.

37:25.631 --> 37:31.230
You come here – desire for that higher life.

37:33.998 --> 37:39.790
But try to get out of this every day-to-day, nonsensical life.

37:40.873 --> 37:42.750
If you want, you can do it.

37:42.750 --> 37:44.800
It's again a question of your wanting.

37:45.891 --> 37:49.470
So throughout it is ‘want’.

37:50.852 --> 37:52.671
What is your desire?

37:57.435 --> 38:04.148
We have desire like ‘children’.

38:04.912 --> 38:07.493
Some people want to have children.

38:08.810 --> 38:12.011
After the children are born, then they say,

38:12.036 --> 38:16.630
“Wow, what these children! God save me!”

38:19.718 --> 38:23.734
Then you want to have money

38:25.010 --> 38:29.123
and most of those money people are now in jail.

38:38.159 --> 38:40.983
Then you want to have fame.

38:42.934 --> 38:48.467
The fame of the people never helps them,

38:49.149 --> 38:58.515
only it gives you problems because of jealousies and all kinds of things.

38:59.225 --> 39:01.679
If fame was such a good thing,

39:01.704 --> 39:03.751
why should people be jealous?

39:12.279 --> 39:15.918
So the power of Kundalini,

39:16.726 --> 39:18.941
which is your own mother,

39:21.746 --> 39:27.992
which has to... which has to rise, which has to come up,

39:28.088 --> 39:31.001
which has to manifest itself,

39:31.917 --> 39:35.833
because of your pure desire.

39:37.352 --> 39:42.270
So in your introspection, in your pujas, in your meditation,

39:42.310 --> 39:48.453
if you see for yourself why are you meditating –

39:48.824 --> 39:53.270
it is for pure desire of compassion

39:53.310 --> 39:56.484
and love to be awakened within us –

39:58.601 --> 40:01.314
you are already in the meditation,

40:01.604 --> 40:05.213
you're already growing, the growth has started.

40:05.432 --> 40:08.983
And you'll grow so fast that this shell,

40:09.301 --> 40:13.833
which is this human conditioning and egos will just break open.

40:15.177 --> 40:18.910
And then this small little thing

40:18.935 --> 40:22.122
which is only in the triangular bone —

40:22.357 --> 40:27.307
imagine in a... there’s a very little space in the triangular bone —

40:27.844 --> 40:31.947
that it comes out and manifests

40:32.125 --> 40:35.000
and can save the whole world.

40:35.392 --> 40:36.937
Just see

40:38.386 --> 40:43.068
the magnificence, the expansiveness,

40:43.318 --> 40:47.412
the greatness of this Kundalini which was within you

40:47.660 --> 40:51.467
and which came up in its full strength

40:51.634 --> 40:55.235
and has shown tremendous things.

40:57.874 --> 41:01.405
Such people are the really great people

41:01.536 --> 41:07.928
and not the people who are trying to show off

41:07.953 --> 41:13.217
some sort of a brand cloth they wear, try to show off, no.

41:13.800 --> 41:17.633
All these silly ideas and stupidities

41:17.734 --> 41:20.663
have to be given up by Sahaja Yogis

41:29.318 --> 41:37.790
so that this Kundalini wears the beautiful flowers,

41:38.827 --> 41:42.383
your words become fragrant,

41:47.311 --> 41:51.266
your glance becomes soothing,

41:52.821 --> 41:58.354
your smile becomes satisfying.

42:00.327 --> 42:03.199
Everything, all your being,

42:03.224 --> 42:09.705
is emitting nothing but goodness, righteousness, peace –

42:10.187 --> 42:12.565
above all, joy.

42:13.866 --> 42:18.666
And the joy you feel now — together

42:20.249 --> 42:23.950
when we were yesterday clapping and singing songs

42:23.975 --> 42:28.575
and we were feeling the joy at a very simple, simple music concert

42:29.401 --> 42:33.922
without any drugs, without any shouting, screaming, nothing —

42:33.963 --> 42:35.761
very simple —

42:36.253 --> 42:41.267
the joy we were feeling, it was because our Kundalini was dancing.

42:42.151 --> 42:47.443
She was so happy because what were you asking there?

42:49.420 --> 42:55.630
Nothing but the enjoyment of collectivity.

42:57.296 --> 43:02.710
Collectivity doesn't mean that we all should be stuck together with some glue

43:02.750 --> 43:07.690
or something or we all become like Gibraltar,

43:08.120 --> 43:11.302
Rock of Gibraltar. No, it doesn’t mean that.

43:11.950 --> 43:15.714
It means wherever you are, you are connected.

43:17.144 --> 43:19.050
That is collectivity.

43:19.292 --> 43:27.219
A connected doesn’t mean that you hate that person. No,

43:27.714 --> 43:31.069
you’re connected means you love that person,

43:31.710 --> 43:34.902
you’re concerned about that person.

43:35.476 --> 43:41.733
The connection, the connecting line, is of love and not of hatred.

43:42.030 --> 43:48.006
So, when you are connected with another person, or persons,

43:49.613 --> 43:52.659
then you are in collectivity.

43:52.775 --> 43:58.037
But people will live together and everyday break each other’s heads.

43:59.917 --> 44:05.187
Some of them really give me headaches, I tell you, sometimes because

44:08.102 --> 44:14.148
they are nowhere near the real growth of Sahaja Yoga.

44:15.938 --> 44:20.890
So you may be in America, you may be in India,

44:20.915 --> 44:22.841
you may be anywhere.

44:23.129 --> 44:25.062
You are just connected.

44:25.820 --> 44:27.905
And you are concerned.

44:28.041 --> 44:30.856
As soon as there’s a problem somewhere,

44:30.951 --> 44:35.576
into any part, any part of the world,

44:37.620 --> 44:42.590
you are connected and you’re effective, you can manage.

44:44.620 --> 44:48.670
But if you are not connected and you are just glued together,

44:48.710 --> 44:54.426
it’s very inconvenient to live under such circumstances.

44:54.991 --> 44:59.350
I think people don’t even understand the meaning of collectivity

45:00.539 --> 45:03.269
where there’s not the other,

45:03.294 --> 45:06.721
ananya, where there’s not the other,

45:07.635 --> 45:09.974
there’s no other personality.

45:12.926 --> 45:18.396
These personalities are separated from you

45:18.421 --> 45:23.461
because of left and right or could be both.

45:27.122 --> 45:30.176
But you are yourself fully

45:30.660 --> 45:33.950
when you’re absolutely detached

45:33.950 --> 45:37.270
and your Kundalini is dancing.

45:37.270 --> 45:40.481
You're alone and never alone.

45:47.171 --> 45:50.965
This oneness with the whole

45:52.728 --> 45:57.490
gives you all the security that you want,

45:57.515 --> 45:59.458
all the joy you want

46:02.125 --> 46:08.340
and that's why Kundalini Awakening means collectivity.

46:10.051 --> 46:17.051
Unless and until you want pure collectivity in your being,

46:17.840 --> 46:20.133
Kundalini won't rise.

46:21.987 --> 46:25.744
I feel sad sometimes when people tell me,

46:25.834 --> 46:29.624
“This gentleman is like this, this lady’s like this

46:29.649 --> 46:32.619
and she just says things like that

46:32.757 --> 46:38.977
and she tries to put down her orders” or some man like that.

46:39.228 --> 46:42.711
And I really can’t understand what are they doing here.

46:45.263 --> 46:47.438
We don’t want Hitlers.

46:51.143 --> 46:58.511
This attitude of ours, so far has been on a different level,

46:58.536 --> 47:02.750
like acquire more money, acquire more wealth, acquire more houses,

47:02.790 --> 47:08.264
acquire more cars, acquire more wives, husbands, whatever it is, children.

47:09.910 --> 47:13.150
But the whole thing changes in Sahaja Yoga.

47:13.190 --> 47:15.498
You enjoy everything.

47:15.693 --> 47:18.165
All right, this is your hall,

47:18.190 --> 47:21.218
doesn’t matter whosoever it … I am enjoying.

47:21.243 --> 47:24.003
It’s better not to pay for it and enjoy

47:26.623 --> 47:28.738
other people’s money!

47:33.419 --> 47:37.042
This carpet is not mine, very good. That’s excellent.

47:37.652 --> 47:39.794
It’s beautiful, I’m enjoying.

47:40.972 --> 47:45.070
Maybe the one who has got this, one must be worried about something.

47:45.095 --> 47:48.582
It might get spoiled or some such thing, but I’m enjoying.

47:52.367 --> 47:56.392
So when this detachment comes, really enjoy everything.

47:57.846 --> 48:01.418
And in that detachment only you enjoy others also

48:01.458 --> 48:05.298
because you are so detached about it, don’t want anything with anyone.

48:05.298 --> 48:08.298
Only person to person you enjoy.

48:09.396 --> 48:13.712
That means you enjoy the spirit of another person

48:13.786 --> 48:17.618
through your spirit, Atmanya Atmanyat.

48:17.618 --> 48:22.194
It is through the spirit only you enjoy another’s spirit.

48:26.413 --> 48:29.538
And then the spirit itself is, as you know,

48:29.578 --> 48:32.022
is the source of knowledge.

48:33.037 --> 48:40.309
The light of the spirit is the light of love, compassion, forgiveness, everything.

48:45.989 --> 48:49.578
All that starts shining in through your faces.

48:49.578 --> 48:51.949
I mean, from faces you can make out a Sahaja Yogi.

48:51.974 --> 48:54.199
There’s no need to put hands and see.

48:54.224 --> 48:58.560
You know this is a Sahaja Yogi, can’t be anything else.

49:04.920 --> 49:08.033
So the relationship with the Adi Kundalini

49:08.058 --> 49:13.058
is that it is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini.

49:14.542 --> 49:18.440
Now the reflection — supposing you take an Indian mirror;

49:18.789 --> 49:24.965
you look in the mirror and you find you look like nothing on earth,

49:25.793 --> 49:30.218
it will just cut you into three pieces, maybe, or anything.

49:31.755 --> 49:34.618
But if you take a Belgian mirror, say,

49:35.221 --> 49:39.720
then the reflection is correct, full –

49:40.178 --> 49:43.058
but still not three dimensional.

49:43.983 --> 49:48.777
But this is a four dimensional reflection —

49:48.802 --> 49:54.096
four dimensional, what is called as turya state.

49:55.176 --> 50:01.778
And that four dimensional personality

50:04.075 --> 50:11.978
you have reflected because of your reflector of your desire.

50:13.354 --> 50:19.366
The reflector is the desire and the reflection is complete.

50:24.255 --> 50:28.739
So when you worship the Adi Kundalini,

50:28.872 --> 50:32.724
what you are trying to do is to cleanse your Kundalini

50:32.749 --> 50:35.429
as well as please the Deities.

50:37.432 --> 50:40.461
Because this is an object,

50:41.051 --> 50:44.667
it is object, it is not to be changed –

50:44.778 --> 50:48.026
but the reflection can change.

50:55.764 --> 50:59.818
The movement of Kundalini also depends

50:59.858 --> 51:02.892
on the temperament of the person,

51:04.316 --> 51:09.223
what sort of a desire he has for his Kundalini to rise.

51:09.503 --> 51:12.391
First of all, there are people who doubt.

51:13.026 --> 51:15.446
They don’t even believe there is Kundalini.

51:15.471 --> 51:17.460
All right, even if they believe, they say,

51:17.485 --> 51:20.947
“Oh, the air might be coming out of something else.”

51:21.901 --> 51:23.875
They don’t want to believe.

51:25.420 --> 51:27.739
So it’s dishonesty.

51:32.114 --> 51:35.778
Kundalini cannot give you dishonesty.

51:35.818 --> 51:39.138
It can give you honesty and faith in honesty.

51:45.744 --> 51:51.058
So she gives you faith in goodness, faith in honesty,

51:51.058 --> 51:56.938
not just by sermon or lecture, nothing by reading Bible or anything,

51:57.883 --> 52:02.194
but actually by actualizing the experience.

52:03.484 --> 52:05.894
Now, supposing

52:12.232 --> 52:13.661
you want

52:18.012 --> 52:20.325
to go to the garden, supposing.

52:20.919 --> 52:23.458
Just you want to go to the garden

52:24.508 --> 52:27.018
and suddenly you find in the garden.

52:28.195 --> 52:31.720
Then you will know that your desire is pure. That’s why it has worked out.

52:31.745 --> 52:33.870
“How am I in the garden?

52:34.150 --> 52:37.658
Has garden walked to me or I have walked into the garden?”

52:39.401 --> 52:42.618
All such things go on happening within you.

52:44.041 --> 52:48.635
These are miracles, as they call it, miracles of Sahaja Yoga. Is not that.

52:48.718 --> 52:53.658
Is the pure desire works it because it is powerful.

52:54.221 --> 52:56.280
It just works it.

52:58.868 --> 53:02.000
And when it works it, works the whole thing out,

53:02.062 --> 53:04.557
you develop that faith within yourself.

53:05.226 --> 53:09.773
So that faith, if it is within you,

53:12.258 --> 53:15.826
nobody can challenge that faith,

53:16.732 --> 53:20.285
which is not a blind faith but an open-eyes,

53:20.310 --> 53:26.741
experienced faith which is established within you — cannot be challenged.

53:27.701 --> 53:30.529
If you have the faith, it will be done.

53:33.978 --> 53:37.771
That’s why I always say don’t say even off-hand things

53:37.796 --> 53:40.266
because you’re Sahaja Yogis, you are connected.

53:41.274 --> 53:46.165
If you say, “Let that plane be late,” it will be.

53:47.157 --> 53:50.240
There is no need to say such things.

53:50.551 --> 53:53.257
We have had so many experiences like this.

53:53.282 --> 53:57.054
I have been telling Sahaja Yogis not to say something off-hand

53:57.099 --> 54:00.040
because you must know you are connected now.

54:00.893 --> 54:06.262
Your pure desire is now being fulfilled

54:06.287 --> 54:09.379
and you are now connected, now you are divine,

54:09.982 --> 54:12.528
you are realized souls,

54:13.246 --> 54:16.705
you are very different from others. You can’t imagine.

54:16.730 --> 54:18.930
I can't talk like this to anyone.

54:18.955 --> 54:22.721
Take any judge, for example, even from France,

54:25.513 --> 54:29.979
I can’t explain anything to them or talk to them.

54:30.004 --> 54:32.004
It’s beyond their mind.

54:32.029 --> 54:37.069
But for you, all this subtle knowledge is just being absorbed

54:37.371 --> 54:40.491
because your Kundalini’s absorbing it.

54:44.767 --> 54:50.818
Now, as it is, you know I always perspire too much. Why?

54:50.843 --> 54:53.723
Because I go on absorbing your heat.

54:53.748 --> 54:56.404
I absorb so much that I perspire.

54:56.429 --> 55:01.053
So much, despite the fact that you people are having a nice cool breeze,

55:01.498 --> 55:03.139
and I am feeling hot.

55:05.556 --> 55:08.908
So this, your Kundalini, also absorbs.

55:10.626 --> 55:16.050
But whatever you absorb is absorbed back by Me.

55:17.162 --> 55:21.207
But that becomes like a barometer.

55:21.232 --> 55:24.581
Immediately you know, “This is this. This is done.

55:24.659 --> 55:29.052
He’s very hot. He’s like this.”

55:29.307 --> 55:34.547
You immediately know, without even thinking, without for asking,

55:34.572 --> 55:37.892
without any desires, you know that this one is like that.

55:38.725 --> 55:42.226
But the same fellow will be quite friendly with others, is all right,

55:42.269 --> 55:46.206
but you just can’t stand it because your Kundalini is a barometer

55:46.231 --> 55:50.631
and she tells you what’s wrong with others, with yourself.

55:54.056 --> 55:57.208
Now, for example, Agnya is a problem, Agnya.

55:57.255 --> 56:00.658
Everybody, “Mother, Agnya is a problem. Agnya is a problem.”

56:01.498 --> 56:03.870
“Yes, I am egoistical.”

56:03.969 --> 56:07.289
No one says that — means that.

56:08.706 --> 56:13.983
So you are the one who can know about yourself that is Self Knowledge

56:14.008 --> 56:16.492
and also you can know about others

56:16.517 --> 56:20.197
because of the Kundalini’s purity, is the reflector.

56:23.673 --> 56:29.178
And the more you become a better reflector, the more Kundalini shows.

56:33.141 --> 56:36.538
So, for us it is important to know

56:36.538 --> 56:40.378
that our Kundalini’s awakened, that is the pure desire,

56:40.378 --> 56:42.138
that’s the pure mother of us.

56:42.178 --> 56:46.938
Each one has got a separate mother, individual mother,

56:46.978 --> 56:54.818
and that this Kundalini, whichever we have our own separate,

56:54.818 --> 56:58.138
different from others in a way that she...

56:58.178 --> 57:03.578
her awareness about us is different.

57:03.618 --> 57:08.298
But, in her function, in her methods,

57:08.338 --> 57:11.876
she’s just the same in everyone.

57:16.053 --> 57:21.338
She, she knows about me, she knows about you, she knows about you,

57:21.378 --> 57:26.149
so she’s different in a way, in the knowledge,

57:26.658 --> 57:31.938
but the way that she works in everyone is just the same.

57:33.925 --> 57:36.738
You wouldn’t find somebody’s Kundalini in the stomach,

57:36.763 --> 57:38.923
somebody’s in the throat.

57:39.556 --> 57:41.738
It’s in the same place

57:41.738 --> 57:46.138
and it moves the same way. It cures the same way.

57:46.178 --> 57:47.858
It works the same way,

57:47.858 --> 57:50.978
except that it has the knowledge.

57:51.601 --> 57:54.935
For example, if you have two Mercedes cars,

57:55.535 --> 57:58.880
they work the same way — exactly the same.

57:58.958 --> 58:04.814
But supposing if I have to go from here to, say, Frankfurt,

58:04.853 --> 58:09.048
then the road is circuitous, so she has to go in a circuitous way.

58:10.102 --> 58:13.344
But another Mercedes, which has to go on a straight route,

58:13.369 --> 58:14.972
it will go on a straight route.

58:14.997 --> 58:17.298
But the working is the same.

58:18.207 --> 58:22.317
Only the knowledge she has about you in particular

58:22.342 --> 58:26.036
she knows you very well out and out. Remember this.

58:26.100 --> 58:27.739
You cannot cheat her.

58:30.524 --> 58:32.825
She knows you very well

58:33.692 --> 58:36.789
and that is the reason why today we are here

58:36.814 --> 58:40.208
to worship our Kundalini, to give her all the credit,

58:40.263 --> 58:45.741
that “Oh, Mother, You have given us these great powers.

58:46.514 --> 58:50.270
You have given us this subtle knowledge within ourself.

58:51.334 --> 58:53.210
You have

58:58.243 --> 59:02.415
given us the love which encompasses the whole world”

59:03.564 --> 59:11.690
And the more and the more you become aware of her connections —

59:11.784 --> 59:14.921
very, very delicate connections —

59:17.005 --> 59:20.633
then you’ll be amazed. In one of my photographs which came out,

59:20.658 --> 59:24.714
you must have seen many, many lines going like that,

59:26.433 --> 59:29.387
but very thin lines,

59:31.011 --> 59:32.662
sharp, thin.

59:33.714 --> 59:35.950
This is how we are.

59:37.782 --> 59:40.940
Now we are all realized souls.

59:42.112 --> 59:46.042
Only thing, if we have to develop ourselves and grow,

59:46.067 --> 59:50.231
we have to ask for, desire for,

59:51.528 --> 59:54.536
something very beautiful.

59:56.676 --> 59:58.978
But our attention is moving on nonsensical things.

59:59.018 --> 01:00:01.140
How will you grow?

01:00:05.138 --> 01:00:07.693
That's why I said we have to meditate

01:00:07.731 --> 01:00:10.771
so we get into thoughtless awareness

01:00:10.804 --> 01:00:16.627
by which we allow the Kundalini to grow.

01:00:21.426 --> 01:00:25.667
I hope after today's program

01:00:25.692 --> 01:00:29.192
people will pay attention to their own Kundalini

01:00:29.217 --> 01:00:32.285
and not to the defects of other people.

01:00:32.415 --> 01:00:34.618
First you must grow

01:00:34.786 --> 01:00:39.866
and develop a personality of that compassion and love and everything.

01:00:41.715 --> 01:00:46.498
Then only you’ll be amazed.

01:00:47.707 --> 01:00:50.805
You’ll grow into something really,

01:00:51.762 --> 01:00:57.842
a beautiful picture of perfection as a human being.

01:01:01.123 --> 01:01:03.834
So may God bless you.

01:01:15.695 --> 01:01:18.965
I didn’t want to go into the details of the mathematics

01:01:18.990 --> 01:01:22.299
of three and a half and this and that and this — forget it.

01:01:25.352 --> 01:01:29.899
There’s no need to deal with all those mathematical calculations and things.

01:01:29.924 --> 01:01:31.492
There’s no need.

01:01:31.921 --> 01:01:35.841
I mean it’s the mathematics of love,
and what is the mathematics of love?

01:01:43.211 --> 01:01:45.198
But I am writing a book,

01:01:45.941 --> 01:01:50.607
if you want to know about it, you can read it later on

01:01:50.632 --> 01:01:52.825
once you have become something great, then,

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:55.174
otherwise it will go into your head again.

01:02:00.469 --> 01:02:02.491
Agnya is too much.

01:02:02.961 --> 01:02:07.390
What is making you so very Agnya?

01:02:09.052 --> 01:02:12.221
I didn't say anything to hurt you, did I?

01:02:38.333 --> 01:02:39.709
Better?

01:02:42.583 --> 01:02:45.639
I think we all should put our finger to our Agnya

01:02:45.664 --> 01:02:47.498
and move it a little.

01:02:51.931 --> 01:02:57.457
Here we become really thoughtlessly aware and detached.

01:03:02.701 --> 01:03:04.323
Move it slowly.

01:03:20.265 --> 01:03:23.667
Ah, better, much relaxed.
