00:00:51,823 --> 00:01:01,735
Public Program, 26 April 1999
Levent Kırca and Oya Basar Theatre, Istanbul (Turkey)

2
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:22,947
I bow to all the seekers  of truth.

3
00:03:28,908 --> 00:03:37,868
 We are at the time bond, is very important.

4
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:46,766
At this time there is so much of turmoils,

5
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:50,395
so much of problems, so many wars,

6
00:03:50,472 --> 00:03:58,786
all kinds of interrogation has taken place in our value system.

7
00:04:12,706 --> 00:04:17,668
And we are quite shocked about that, very much shocked.

8
00:04:24,533 --> 00:04:28,652
What is the problem?

9
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:32,306
Why this is happening?

10
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:35,230
We should try to find out.

11
00:04:40,269 --> 00:04:45,852
And if there is a solution
we should try to achieve it.

12
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:56,377
The problems are there because
human beings do not know themselves.

13
00:05:03,422 --> 00:05:07,175
Either they think too much of themselves,

14
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:11,535
they have too much of Ego or
 they are very much conditioned.

15
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:28,212
There is no conditioning

16
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:32,048
that we can say  is not troublesome,

17
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:46,172
because they blindly accept all the nonsense.

18
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:58,746
Now we  see the problem, say
we are born in particular religion

19
00:06:04,257 --> 00:06:10,242
and we just start following everything that is told to us.

20
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:23,513
I ask people if they have read Quran Sharif

21
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:31,397
Very few have really read

22
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:39,300
 and is completely, sometimes, I find is represented.

23
00:06:46,183 --> 00:06:50,809
That brings bad name to Islam, also to Muhammad Sahab.

24
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:13,319
According to us prophet  Muhammad was a very, very great soul.

25
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:28,510
We call him as Adi Guru, means one of the
primordial masters who got birth on this Earth.

26
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:43,840
Now such a great soul like him would not say he is divine.

27
00:07:43,865 --> 00:07:48,088
I can not believe that,
but he did not say once divine.

28
00:07:54,836 --> 00:07:58,456
Maybe because if somebody says he is Divine,

29
00:07:58,481 --> 00:08:02,746
then peoplejust get  after the life of a  divine personality.

30
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:16,026
And it is how much he was tortured,

31
00:08:16,083 --> 00:08:20,276
how much he was troubled, endless.

32
00:08:29,288 --> 00:08:34,059
No one may  say why should such a Divine person suffered,

33
00:08:34,117 --> 00:08:37,910
he did not suffered but he had sufferings

34
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:41,958
even by people who were ignorant,

35
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:59,534
because they were absolutely blind.

36
00:08:59,569 --> 00:09:04,386
They didn't  know  what sort of a great person he was.

37
00:09:13,637 --> 00:09:17,671
All such great saints had suffer.

38
00:09:22,172 --> 00:09:25,788
All over the world the saints had suffered

39
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:37,758
because the people do not know what saintliness is.

40
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:47,063
First of all they should know themselves.

41
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:57,042
Once they know themselves,
 they will know what Muhammad Sahab was.

42
00:10:05,026 --> 00:10:09,142
They will also know about Quran-ı Sharif
(Sharif -Holy, honorable).

43
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:18,210
It is absolutely clear cut in the Qur’an,

44
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:22,874
but people  want to listen the pret,
you can not help it.

45
00:10:30,829 --> 00:10:36,872
Christ also said that know thy self.

46
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:50,321
All those, who were so great,
 had told to know ourselves.

47
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,402
Those who had not known themselves, have no right

48
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,962
to talk about them or to condemn them
or to say horrible things.

49
00:11:20,101 --> 00:11:23,077
After you have come to know yourself only,

50
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:26,533
you will know how great they were

51
00:11:33,628 --> 00:11:38,518
and how Quran Sharif is such an important book.

52
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:51,498
Even those who read such a great book

53
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:55,334
are doing all kinds of nonsensical things .

54
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:07,023
They have no control over their greed.

55
00:12:10,385 --> 00:12:13,482
They have no control over their lust,

56
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:19,339
they can be very cruel also.

57
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,383
How can that be?

58
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:31,398
If you read such a great book like Quran Sharif,

59
00:12:31,423 --> 00:12:34,694
then how can you be like that?

60
00:12:41,569 --> 00:12:45,603
Because  all this reading does not go in the heart.

61
00:12:50,244 --> 00:12:58,946
He has talked about Rahmet (mercy, clemency),
he called it Rahim (compassionate, forgiving) .

62
00:13:11,742 --> 00:13:14,448
Where is that Rahmet?

63
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:17,436
If do you see that  anywhere?

64
00:13:21,248 --> 00:13:25,090
They are all killing each other in the name of God.

65
00:13:29,273 --> 00:13:36,793
So this is the state of the truth,
of reality, of divinity.

66
00:13:43,596 --> 00:13:48,153
Now what is needed is first to know thy self.

67
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:59,680
For that, it is placed within you,
 in the triangle bone,

68
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,907
this special power  called as Kundalini,

69
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:12,436
whether you are a Hindu, Muslim, Christian, anything.

70
00:14:19,142 --> 00:14:23,626
As they have a heart, they also have this power.

71
00:14:27,808 --> 00:14:30,942
Then how can we say we are different?

72
00:14:35,347 --> 00:14:38,214
We are all human begins, no doubt.

73
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:46,875
But the power of the saint is in every human being.

74
00:14:51,342 --> 00:14:55,515
So we have to accept that we all can ascent

75
00:14:55,573 --> 00:14:59,067
whether we follow this religion, or that religion,

76
00:14:59,086 --> 00:15:02,278
or this country, or that country,
 makes no difference.

77
00:15:12,797 --> 00:15:15,479
It's written in  Quran Sharif also

78
00:15:15,527 --> 00:15:18,917
it is not only my words, it is written everywhere

79
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:22,766
that we all human beings are the same.

80
00:15:32,385 --> 00:15:35,593
If so, if that is the situation,

81
00:15:35,618 --> 00:15:39,818
then why  should we all not know ourselves.

82
00:15:44,697 --> 00:15:51,160
It is very easy to know yourself in these modern times,

83
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,053
It has been the esteem

84
00:15:58,078 --> 00:16:03,315
 that  in these modern times we should know ourselves.

85
00:16:11,483 --> 00:16:15,429
You have to have the Self knowledge.

86
00:16:22,318 --> 00:16:27,018
You have knowledge of everything outside
what about your Self?

87
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:39,494
When you will know your Self you will be amazed

88
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:46,515
that you all are part and parcel of one great personality, Upper.

89
00:16:58,162 --> 00:17:01,979
When we say “Allah hu Akbar
(Lord, the Biggest)”

90
00:17:02,523 --> 00:17:06,706
what do we say is that we are one,

91
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:10,615
in one personality that is Upper.

92
00:17:23,272 --> 00:17:27,921
Just by think “Allah hu Akbar”, you do not realized,

93
00:17:27,957 --> 00:17:32,966
you do not become part and parcel of the great Upper.

94
00:17:40,731 --> 00:17:45,365
You go out shouting for ages, for centuries,

95
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:49,927
you will not become part and parcel of Upper.

96
00:17:59,696 --> 00:18:03,126
For that you have to know yourself

97
00:18:03,158 --> 00:18:10,173
and that you have to get connected to
this all pervading Power of Ruh (Spirit).

98
00:18:21,991 --> 00:18:25,475
You have some Sufis,
 but nobody believed them

99
00:18:25,491 --> 00:18:28,398
because they were realized souls.

100
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:42,330
Especially in your country, you had such a great people

101
00:18:42,355 --> 00:18:46,489
who came to tell you that you should know yourself ,

102
00:18:54,909 --> 00:19:00,060
but we got lost, in these modern times
we got lost, completely.

103
00:19:06,201 --> 00:19:08,637
Where are we?

104
00:19:13,475 --> 00:19:16,662
What are we fighting for?

105
00:19:21,776 --> 00:19:26,950
How can blind fight,

106
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:32,410
we do not  know anything,

107
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:35,167
we do not know  our meaning.

108
00:19:40,404 --> 00:19:42,554
How is possible?

109
00:19:42,779 --> 00:19:48,225
It is very much possible for you all to get your

110
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:53,042
self realization, self knowledge, to know yourself.

111
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:05,922
Even if you are fanatics, listen to me.

112
00:20:09,595 --> 00:20:13,851
Because this will  save you, save your children,

113
00:20:13,922 --> 00:20:18,572
 save everyone, save Turkey and save the whole world.

114
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:31,286
You have to raise  about this limited ideas,

115
00:20:31,312 --> 00:20:34,256
that you get from others.

116
00:20:45,388 --> 00:20:49,697
You have to have a feeling,

117
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:53,533
the experience of  this Ruh.

118
00:20:58,537 --> 00:21:05,793
Without that , you cannot know anything
about prophet Muhammad or Islam.

119
00:21:15,531 --> 00:21:18,490
 Islam is to surrender,

120
00:21:21,482 --> 00:21:24,345
 it doesn't mean  aggression.

121
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:35,018
Surrender to who?

122
00:21:37,434 --> 00:21:41,356
 To God, to his power,

123
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:45,152
which is the power of love.

124
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:53,173
God loved us,

125
00:21:53,293 --> 00:21:55,951
so he created us.

126
00:22:01,516 --> 00:22:05,844
If we haven't got that power of love,

127
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:09,265
if we haven't just  his power of love ,

128
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:13,459
no use during any namaz or anything no use.

129
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:28,473
The namaz (daily Muslim worshiping) you do is nothing,

130
00:22:28,770 --> 00:22:31,650
but for your Kundalini awakening.

131
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:43,281
You will realize that

132
00:22:43,306 --> 00:22:46,279
after your Self Knowledge,

133
00:22:46,684 --> 00:22:51,012
even if you do namaz it has great meaning.

134
00:23:00,314 --> 00:23:04,671
Once you start feeling this cool breeze

135
00:23:04,712 --> 00:23:07,182
after Holy Ghost as they call it,

136
00:23:07,318 --> 00:23:09,667
or you  can say this Ruh,

137
00:23:09,995 --> 00:23:16,291
then when you do namaz it goes on increasing,
you go on

138
00:23:17,501 --> 00:23:20,137
becoming higher and higher.

139
00:23:31,019 --> 00:23:35,082
Otherwise, any number of namaz can you do,

140
00:23:35,107 --> 00:23:38,592
  rouse are you do, you can not do it.

141
00:23:48,173 --> 00:23:53,252
And a seed has to be sprout,

142
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:55,980
otherwise it cannot grow.

143
00:24:01,895 --> 00:24:06,848
In the same way your Kundalini has to be awaken

144
00:24:06,873 --> 00:24:09,724
 like a primula  of a seed.
(brightly coloured flowers in the spring)

145
00:24:16,948 --> 00:24:22,721
Without this sprouting,
 how can you grow, artificially?

146
00:24:28,666 --> 00:24:34,786
So please understand that first let this sprouting things

147
00:24:41,462 --> 00:24:44,337
and then you do namaz,

148
00:24:44,488 --> 00:24:47,619
and you will be amazed that

149
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:50,185
 the chaitanya work on

150
00:24:50,219 --> 00:24:54,920
vibrations there  are flowing increase tremendously.

151
00:25:08,786 --> 00:25:11,926
Also then you read Qur’an

152
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:16,286
and these vibrations will increase tremendously!

153
00:25:23,453 --> 00:25:26,508
You will grow very fast.

154
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:35,301
All the things that you do in the name of God,

155
00:25:35,352 --> 00:25:37,986
you will have the experience

156
00:25:38,089 --> 00:25:41,675
that are all true, there is truth in it.

157
00:25:48,954 --> 00:25:54,656
But you have to allow the seed to be sprout.

158
00:25:58,455 --> 00:26:06,034
Without that you are just like any other  material.

159
00:26:11,563 --> 00:26:17,895
Something artificial living in the false world,

160
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:21,463
doing all kinds of wrong things

161
00:26:21,955 --> 00:26:27,015
without bothering about God Almighty.

162
00:26:36,917 --> 00:26:38,660
Not only that you will know your Self,

163
00:26:38,685 --> 00:26:43,576
 but you will know all the powers that
get out of that knowledge.

164
00:26:54,426 --> 00:27:00,690
The first power you get is of tremendously creativity.

165
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,927
As it is Turkish are known for their  creativity,

166
00:27:17,372 --> 00:27:21,709
they will create  such a beautiful art

167
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:27,601
 that it will be appealing to the
whole world on Global level.

168
00:27:39,737 --> 00:27:45,427
Now you become extremely moral by nature.

169
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:55,689
You do not have to be very rigid about this,

170
00:27:56,396 --> 00:28:00,567
 you just become you become very moral.

171
00:28:09,413 --> 00:28:12,931
Whatever is said  “don’t do this, don’t do that!”,

172
00:28:12,963 --> 00:28:15,979
nothing is to be told;

173
00:28:22,609 --> 00:28:26,531
 because your Spirit is now enlightened

174
00:28:30,293 --> 00:28:34,779
and in the blank of that spirit
you know what is good for you,

175
00:28:34,785 --> 00:28:36,700
and what is distracting for you.

176
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,872
Now Muhammed said not to drink alcohol,

177
00:28:49,946 --> 00:28:52,533
we do not say do not drink ,

178
00:28:59,139 --> 00:29:03,750
because if I say that half of the people will just go away.

179
00:29:10,593 --> 00:29:14,037
 But after you get this knowledge

180
00:29:14,089 --> 00:29:16,884
 which is constructive for yourself ,

181
00:29:16,917 --> 00:29:19,530
you yourself do not drink,

182
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:22,102
 you do not take any alcohol,

183
00:29:22,136 --> 00:29:24,544
 you do not take any drug,
 you do not smoke,

184
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:28,493
 you do not take anything
 that can destroy your body.

185
00:29:41,172 --> 00:29:43,712
You do not have to tell your children

186
00:29:43,737 --> 00:29:47,825
 “do this, do that” , it works out automatically.

187
00:29:53,114 --> 00:29:57,621
It is very surprising how powerful you become,

188
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:01,523
 that you do not have to do anything

189
00:30:01,573 --> 00:30:05,033
 to stop yourself of doing something wrong.

190
00:30:17,719 --> 00:30:20,703
 Then you become very sensitive

191
00:30:20,738 --> 00:30:23,414
as to what is right and what is wrong

192
00:30:23,439 --> 00:30:27,113
and you just do not accept that is wrong.

193
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:41,523
 This discrimination  is just within you,
 which is enlightened.

194
00:30:49,782 --> 00:30:56,587
Then for everything: for food, for

195
00:30:56,754 --> 00:31:01,600
taking out money, this -that, all this greed business

196
00:31:01,753 --> 00:31:03,856
 just get controlled.

197
00:31:13,846 --> 00:31:19,346
Above all you become a very very loving person.

198
00:31:24,373 --> 00:31:28,295
You have faith in your own love

199
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:34,598
and you see that your love  succeeds

200
00:31:39,877 --> 00:31:42,936
and you are amazed how it works.

201
00:31:46,625 --> 00:31:48,927
Now the time has come

202
00:31:48,975 --> 00:31:52,117
what you call as a last judgment.

203
00:31:56,078 --> 00:32:00,628
 Now if you get to the right religion,

204
00:32:00,692 --> 00:32:05,505
 if you get to the right understanding of yourself,

205
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:12,367
so you should know you have decided for the highest ascent.

206
00:32:26,313 --> 00:32:31,146
This you will experience yourself

207
00:32:35,146 --> 00:32:39,996
 that you have become extremely loving,

208
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,564
 kind, forgiving person.

209
00:32:50,405 --> 00:32:55,836
 But by doing that you don't become,
don't become weak,

210
00:32:55,845 --> 00:32:57,987
but  you become very strong.

211
00:33:04,197 --> 00:33:07,565
You didn't  see despite all of position

212
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:12,866
 how your Sufis have  stayed

213
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:15,571
that's    on their path of truth.

214
00:33:25,583 --> 00:33:30,228
But now you are not alone, you are not alone.

215
00:33:34,035 --> 00:33:37,480
 You have thousands of them all over the world.

216
00:33:41,829 --> 00:33:45,138
They are your brothers and sisters all over.

217
00:33:49,563 --> 00:33:53,176
You will be amazed how they look after you.

218
00:33:56,475 --> 00:33:58,673
How they are bothered about you,

219
00:34:02,115 --> 00:34:08,210
when you become one with the all pervading akbar,

220
00:34:08,235 --> 00:34:10,615
 then who is the other?

221
00:34:18,114 --> 00:34:24,228
For example, anything happens to
 this finger the whole body reacts.

222
00:34:29,977 --> 00:34:35,629
 In the same way all the Sahaja yogis,
 all the people all over the world,

223
00:34:35,654 --> 00:34:39,458
 who know themselves, will react  together

224
00:34:47,566 --> 00:34:52,766
 and their good wishes will act
 through the Divine Power.

225
00:35:00,591 --> 00:35:05,239
Gradually all this destructive nature

226
00:35:05,272 --> 00:35:11,405
 and also the falsehood of people drops out.

227
00:35:21,727 --> 00:35:25,723
Also you develop another

228
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,742
dimension in your awareness

229
00:35:35,054 --> 00:35:40,636
which is called as collective consciousness.

230
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:49,826
 So what you do, you can  feel
another person on your  fingertips.

231
00:35:54,199 --> 00:35:57,297
 You can feel yourself also on your fingertips.

232
00:36:00,876 --> 00:36:03,701
That is what Mohamed Sahab has said,

233
00:36:03,765 --> 00:36:07,108
 that at the time of Resurrection Kıyama

234
00:36:07,155 --> 00:36:09,137
 your hands will speak

235
00:36:09,162 --> 00:36:13,410
 and will give şahadet  (witness) against you.

236
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:31,889
They will tell you what is wrong with you,

237
00:36:35,022 --> 00:36:39,847
your fingers will tell you what is wrong
with you, with your body,

238
00:36:39,872 --> 00:36:43,815
with your mind, everything you can know on your fingertips.

239
00:36:51,759 --> 00:36:55,790
Now if you know how to correct

240
00:36:56,055 --> 00:37:02,075
 those defects in you, you can correct anybody’s problems,

241
00:37:10,706 --> 00:37:15,506
 because you can also feel
what is wrong with them on your fingertips.

242
00:37:22,058 --> 00:37:25,845
Sitting down here you can feel for anybody in Ankara

243
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,367
 or maybe London or anywhere

244
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:38,976
and if you know how to correct sitting down here,
 you can correct that person.

245
00:37:46,673 --> 00:37:50,625
So, in short, is the  scientific language we will  say

246
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:54,138
that you enter into the subtler side, the

247
00:37:54,163 --> 00:37:57,759
the subtle of subtlest of Ether.

248
00:38:08,026 --> 00:38:13,505
As your chakras get enlightened,
you enter into the subtler side

249
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:16,804
 of all the five elements.

250
00:38:28,903 --> 00:38:34,263
Ultimately the sixth center,
as they call it Agnya chakra,

251
00:38:34,288 --> 00:38:38,243
is once it is  enlightened,

252
00:38:38,267 --> 00:38:42,076
 then you become extremely forgiving.

253
00:38:52,635 --> 00:38:55,095
You do not react,

254
00:38:57,563 --> 00:39:00,306
you watch everything like a witness.

255
00:39:03,971 --> 00:39:07,711
Certainly now I see this carpet is very well made,

256
00:39:07,743 --> 00:39:10,380
 so normally I should  react.

257
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:19,598
How much it was have cost from
 where did you that buy

258
00:39:19,624 --> 00:39:22,523
who has made it, all these questions will come.

259
00:39:29,872 --> 00:39:32,956
But after the Self Realization

260
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:36,016
you just watch and enjoy

261
00:39:36,041 --> 00:39:40,147
the creativity of the artist who has made this.

262
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:54,330
Your quarreling nature also subsides,

263
00:40:00,368 --> 00:40:02,950
because you do not react.

264
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:12,716
To the last of is  this limbic  area where Kundalini arise

265
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:18,983
 by which you get your peace and joy.

266
00:40:32,441 --> 00:40:36,623
 Now Joy is a singular thing,

267
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:44,823
 it is not happiness and unhappiness.

268
00:40:48,354 --> 00:40:50,465
 It is just  joy

269
00:40:52,277 --> 00:40:55,705
 that means you rises  above your thoughts,

270
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:01,299
above your mind and you are in complete peace.

271
00:41:07,892 --> 00:41:15,556
For example if you are standing

272
00:41:15,618 --> 00:41:19,651
 in the water and the waves are there,
 you are  afraid of it.

273
00:41:25,898 --> 00:41:27,762
But in case,

274
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:31,891
in case , you get into a water,

275
00:41:31,941 --> 00:41:38,184
 then you can watch, you can watch  the waves

276
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:40,583
and enjoy them.

277
00:41:49,614 --> 00:41:53,535
But supposing you know swimming ,

278
00:41:53,575 --> 00:41:56,971
you can jump and save many others.

279
00:42:04,636 --> 00:42:10,039
So now Sahaja yoga is  working
  in eighty countries  in the whole world.

280
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:17,842
and in a very big way.

281
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:23,355
Some people who got their self realisation

282
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,644
went around and give realization at to others.

283
00:42:31,431 --> 00:42:33,812
For that you do not have to pay

284
00:42:36,488 --> 00:42:39,649
It's a natural process, living process

285
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:42,116
How much would you pay for that?

286
00:42:49,045 --> 00:42:52,562
So it was without any payment,

287
00:42:57,539 --> 00:43:01,092
that's how the falsehood can be exposed

288
00:43:05,695 --> 00:43:08,456
because you pay for all kinds of falsehood.

289
00:43:12,352 --> 00:43:15,462
Now you can say who has pay for this all.

290
00:43:15,487 --> 00:43:18,560
 I must  say  the Sahaja yogis have paid.

291
00:43:26,388 --> 00:43:29,413
Formally I used to pay,

292
00:43:31,975 --> 00:43:34,774
because I have money from my  family

293
00:43:34,799 --> 00:43:36,241
also from my husband.

294
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,127
Now they want to pay.

295
00:43:43,779 --> 00:43:46,663
 They  think  for our self realization ,

296
00:43:46,688 --> 00:43:50,306
you are taking this hall, Mother why you should pay?

297
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:05,567
They can pay for the hall but not for  self realisation.

298
00:44:13,266 --> 00:44:17,038
Then the last center is broken,the seventh One

299
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:21,183
 by which we get connected with this all pervading power.

300
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:36,632
Which we have not felt so far.
the presence of this all pervading power.

301
00:44:42,878 --> 00:44:51,444
But after self realization you feel it,
this cool breeze, the Ruh (spirit).

302
00:44:58,798 --> 00:45:03,085
In the beginning if very hot,

303
00:45:07,022 --> 00:45:10,637
 for that you have to forgive everyone,

304
00:45:11,484 --> 00:45:14,602
not to have anger for anyone.

305
00:45:20,876 --> 00:45:23,240
and it works very easily.

306
00:45:26,650 --> 00:45:31,183
I know there are people here
 who want to ask me questions also.

307
00:45:35,706 --> 00:45:39,914
Just now make your questioning mind quite.

308
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:47,142
First get your self realisation

309
00:45:49,988 --> 00:45:52,400
 and then you can ask.

310
00:45:54,858 --> 00:46:00,076
You have to feel this cool breeze on your fingertips.

311
00:46:05,408 --> 00:46:08,169
So have faith in yourself.

312
00:46:10,115 --> 00:46:12,833
And you all  can feel this ruh (spirit).

313
00:46:15,504 --> 00:46:18,108
I assure you ,you can.

314
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:27,297
[UNCLEAR] hardly five to ten minutes.

315
00:46:31,024 --> 00:46:32,978
 I will work it out.

316
00:46:36,041 --> 00:46:39,906
I will request who want to go away ,can go away,

317
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:41,868
don't disturb others.

318
00:46:48,631 --> 00:46:50,773
 I can not force  it only.

319
00:46:54,083 --> 00:46:55,789
You have to ask for it.

320
00:47:00,481 --> 00:47:05,286
If you want to have it,  you can get.

321
00:47:09,220 --> 00:47:12,013
You must have the desire to have it ,

322
00:47:17,227 --> 00:47:19,560
 because is pure desire that works.

323
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,824
There is no competition,
no trouble, nothing at all.

324
00:47:37,493 --> 00:47:42,182
Only thing you have to take out your shoes.

325
00:47:46,755 --> 00:47:50,027
 Because this Mother Earth is very pure

326
00:47:53,529 --> 00:47:55,531
 and she is very helpful.

327
00:48:03,124 --> 00:48:06,838
Can you  wait, Can you wait for a while?

328
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:11,959
You can do it little later.

329
00:48:15,204 --> 00:48:17,370
Don't disturb this attention

330
00:48:21,048 --> 00:48:22,476
for a while.

331
00:48:39,179 --> 00:48:43,790
I am not going to tell you to do anything whatsoever

332
00:48:43,821 --> 00:48:47,435
I will not even say do not think but automatically

333
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:50,587
you will  go beyond your mind

334
00:48:58,719 --> 00:49:02,385
and see then said this torsion area.

335
00:49:02,428 --> 00:49:05,253
 is called it torsion area.

336
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:24,747
Alright, Now we have to do like this,
like we do for namaz that's all.

337
00:49:30,007 --> 00:49:31,584
Be comfortable.

338
00:49:33,116 --> 00:49:37,220
Take off your shoes and put both
the  feet away to  each other.

339
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:55,300
Now  put your right hand on your heart

340
00:50:02,745 --> 00:50:07,653
and ask for forgiveness from God almighty

341
00:50:07,678 --> 00:50:12,029
if we have done anything wrong ,
 just to  ask forgive from heart.

342
00:50:20,384 --> 00:50:22,741
But don't  feel guilty.

343
00:50:25,445 --> 00:50:27,373
Mistake can be done

344
00:50:27,398 --> 00:50:29,819
and  now you ask for forgivness,

345
00:50:29,827 --> 00:50:32,765
so do not feel guilty at all

346
00:50:36,706 --> 00:50:45,053
If you feel guilty then this center
on the left hand gets bothered.

347
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:54,226
And who it is just like
and we are not then coming.

348
00:51:08,332 --> 00:51:14,351
Now please put your right hand  towards me

349
00:51:14,449 --> 00:51:18,389
 and put down your head
and see for yourself

350
00:51:18,413 --> 00:51:23,933
is there  any cool or hot breeze
 coming out  your head.

351
00:51:45,965 --> 00:51:51,896
Now If  it is hot then you have to forgive,
forgive everyone.

352
00:51:57,740 --> 00:52:01,536
Now please down put
your left hand towards me,

353
00:52:01,584 --> 00:52:04,349
 put down your head
and see for yourself

354
00:52:04,374 --> 00:52:09,771
if  there is a cool or  hot  breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

355
00:52:24,283 --> 00:52:28,455
Now please put both
your hands towards me.

fontanel area. Just see it.

358
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,645
This is the ruh.

359
00:53:01,988 --> 00:53:09,533
You can ask a question in your heart ,
is this the ruh  the Divine power?

360
00:53:16,713 --> 00:53:22,714
