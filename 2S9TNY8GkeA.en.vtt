00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:03.840
in a very big hall.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.769
We met, and that’s how the Sahaja Yoga started
growing.

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:16.830
It’s very important for you people from
specially from Germany, Austria.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:26.930
These are the people who were in the war.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:29.770
And now you are in the war with Me.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.320
We have to fight, fight the evil.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.559
You know how the world is.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:44.300
We have to fight them and we have to take
them out of ignorance.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:56.429
You are such a support for this because we
have to change human beings.

00:00:56.429 --> 00:01:02.710
They have to become good people very fast.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:07.000
Once they get their Self-realization, the
change will start.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:15.200
Now in England and also in Italy, what they
are doing is to give realization to people

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.290
on the street.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.729
Giving on the street, thousands of people
now have become realized souls.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:29.799
It’s a very big thing because once you get
your realization, you become the Spirit and

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.280
all the goodness should come to you.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.509
If there is anything evil, bad in you that
will go away.

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:44.130
It’s spreading so fast everywhere and should
also spread in those countries who are there.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.330
There’s no need, no need for you to fight
or quarrel because you have got the divine

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.330
help.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:02:04.409
You have got all the help all the time from
the Divine, and this is what is to be understood:

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:11.910
that we are helped by the Divine to transform
human beings into something greater.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:20.690
That’s what we are and we are here because
I wanted to tell people that you must have

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:27.530
a place, an ashram for Sahaja Yoga, and I
don’t want anybody else, but only sahaja

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.269
yogis there because you don’t know how dirty
people are in this world.

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:41.870
What things they do, you can’t imagine to
what limit they can go and can really try

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:49.230
to harm you because they are not only negative,
but they are sometimes satanic and they’ll

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:56.220
try to ruin your children, ruin your families,
do all kinds of things.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.860
So you have nothing to do with them.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.860
Keep away.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.720
Keep aloof because now you all have been cleansed.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.060
Those who are cleansed people don’t mix
up with people who are muddy, do they?

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.480
And so must have this much of wisdom in your
head to understand that at any cost you will

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.069
not mix up Sahaja Yoga with other things.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.590
It’s very important to know.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.090
I have been trying to tell this since long
that keep yourself aloof.

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.560
But sometimes people don’t do it and then
they suffer a lot.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.610
We have all kinds of devils around, all kinds
of satanic forces acting as some sort of a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.840
cult, or I don’t know what they are doing,
but they’ve done no good to people, no good

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
at all.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.750
Just see what is going on in those days: is
all kinds of fighting, quarrelling, killing.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:02.180
All this is going on, so you must know we
are in the very, very bad type of Kali Yuga

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.489
and we have to fight it out by collectivity.

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.610
Look at the children, how collective they
are.

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:15.799
You all have to be collective and you must
love all the people, all the sahaja yogis

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.570
who are around.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.350
Don’t try to find faults with them.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:27.090
Don’t try to fight with them because it’s
a very important work I am doing.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.430
What I’m trying to do is to transform people,
to make them good people, nice people.

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:43.910
It’s not to get anything out of them, but
to give them something that they should become

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:46.210
very good people.

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:55.190
We have to have extremely good and nice people,
people who don’t hate, people who don’t

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:56.550
have greed.

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.570
Like madness, people have greed.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:07.280
In countries where they could make money,
they have cheated everyone and have made money,

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.150
and that is how their children will suffer.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.940
They will suffer.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:25.699
So My attention is for all of you because
can help Me in this great war, war with the

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:26.699
evil.

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:30.819
These are evil people by temperament and they
want to ruin it.

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.750
You must understand this.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:39.110
Don’t play into their hands and you become
solid because you have not come on this Earth

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:47.090
to collect things and all that, but you have
come here to become sahaja yogis of a very

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.699
great order.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:56.780
Another thing is, if you don’t feel your
joy within yourself, if there is no joy with

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.130
you, you will trouble others.

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:07.009
So best thing is for you is to meditate, not
to criticize, not to use your brain, but meditate.

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:13.009
By meditation, you will know how to enjoy
Sahaja Yoga, how to enjoy everything.

00:06:13.009 --> 00:06:18.050
This has to be there and this mental activity
should go away.

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.020
Don’t try to organize others.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:28.870
Don’t try to give lectures to others, but
what you do is to yourself introspect.

00:06:28.870 --> 00:07:07.030
See for yourself what’s wrong with you and
what wrong things you are doing.

00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:13.110
So not only being peaceful is everything,
no.

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:21.110
Not only being good is equal, all right, but
you have to make others, you have to make

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:24.009
others good people.

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:26.410
You have to make them beautiful people.

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:33.360
We have to make this world beautiful through
your own help and through your attention.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.010
Now the problem is that people take to wrong
things very easily even after Sahaj Yoga.

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:42.260
Don’t support anyone like that.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:48.900
On the contrary, explain to that person that
Sahaja Yoga is a collective activity.

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.990
We cannot have our own anything.

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:53.740
We have to be active.

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:56.800
We have to be together all the time.

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:04.780
Togetherness is very important and then to
seek joy of that togetherness.

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:15.690
If you can feel that joy of togetherness,
you have achieved that aim of life because

00:08:15.690 --> 00:08:24.050
then you’ll gather other people also and
give them this joy of being the Spirit.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:27.050
Once they become the Spirit, it starts changing.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:37.500
But if you are collective and if you are together
and you do all the things, then also you grow

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.500
very much.

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.740
Now, those who talk of separating, having
some sort of a mad idea – please don’t

00:08:42.740 --> 00:08:44.230
listen to them.

00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:45.430
You better check.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.790
Tell them, “We have to be together."

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:51.120
We cannot, we cannot separate.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:53.870
And anything like this will be destroyed.

00:08:53.870 --> 00:09:02.760
Because in this world, you see, how the world
is, how the things are and how it is working

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:03.760
out.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:11.870
So for you to understand the beauty of modern
times, is that you are born in a time when

00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:14.180
you can be transformed.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:21.430
You are born in a time when you can become
the Self, the Spirit.

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.190
Everybody has tried this; nothing has worked
out.

00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.900
Now, with the help of your Kundalini, we are
working it out.

00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:33.600
You also know what is to be done.

00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:39.530
You know how to give realization, how to see
the vibrations, everything.

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:43.710
And once you start seeing that, then you will
realize that what you are doing is a great

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.710
harm to humanity.

00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:47.560
Now I leave upon you, all of you – you are
such sensible, good people who have come to

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.063
Sahaja Yoga, and every time I came here, you
were all here.

00:09:49.063 --> 00:09:50.063
I’m happy so many countries are here only
just knowing that I am coming.

00:09:50.063 --> 00:09:51.063
How much you all love Me, I tell you.

00:09:51.063 --> 00:09:52.063
Really, it’s remarkable.

00:09:52.063 --> 00:09:53.063
All you people have shown your love.

00:09:53.063 --> 00:10:15.400
All of you have come here all the way, when
I am here for such a short time.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.590
So may God bless you all and have sense.

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:26.440
Have sense in your head that you are now responsible
for transforming this world into a new world

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:29.330
of very good people, spiritual people.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:39.970
So your responsibility is that, and as a result,
what you have to do, you will know.

00:10:39.970 --> 00:10:41.970
You all have to be very responsible.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:50.530
Whatever country you may come, whatever place
you may come, but you have to be very, very

00:10:50.530 --> 00:10:57.820
responsible, responsible people, and try to
understand what you are doing for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.860
I can see so many new faces now.

00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:03.330
I’m happy to see them.

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:14.280
Of course most of the Austrians I have met
and Germans I’ve met before, but I see also

00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:16.450
other people from other countries – very
sweet of them to have come.

00:11:16.450 --> 00:11:23.670
So what is important is to surrender, which
is a problem with people.

00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:28.750
They cannot surrender themselves to Sahaja
Yoga.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.580
That’s what is your life.

00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:36.240
That is the beautiful river of goodness.

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:41.820
So you should try to surrender and if you
cannot surrender, then there’s something

00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:43.250
wrong with you.

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:51.560
Please try to surrender and you’ll be surprised
that with this surrendering only you can get

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.540
complete joy, happiness and peace.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:12:05.690
That is very important and that’s what I
have come to tell you that please try to surrender.

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:10.740
And surrendering is – I cannot say how you
force yourself, but you just go into thoughtless

00:12:10.740 --> 00:12:11.740
awareness.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:19.690
You meditate and into thoughtless awareness
and then I’m sure, with all My love and

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:25.600
with all My blessings, I’m sure you will
surrender – not only surrender, but you

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:33.280
will develop tremendous powers to convert
others also, to transform others into this

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.480
good work.

00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:38.820
You all have that and if you just develop
and try to find out how many people you have

00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:40.390
helped really in life to change.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.670
Thank you very much.
