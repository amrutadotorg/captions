Shri KRISHNA PUJA
Primordial Taboos and Sahaj Dharma

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:45.810
August 23, 1997 – CABELLA, Italy

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:31.840
Lecture starts here:

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:59.449
Today we are here to celebrate Krishna Puja.
I went to America and they wanted Me to have

00:05:16.749 --> 00:05:23.749
a Mahakali Puja. But I said, “No, let Me
talk about Krishna only.” Because we have

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:33.990
to first realize what is the strength of this
Puja, how are we going to establish Shri Krishna

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:42.449
within ourselves.

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:49.449
He Himself has said that “Whenever there
is a downfall of dharma.” Dharma doesn’t

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:57.129
mean what we understand as Hinduism, Christianity
or Islamic nonsense - it is not. Dharma means

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:09.340
our primordial taboos that are built-in, in
the human beings. About these, I think aboriginals

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:22.129
knew better than we. But then what we did,
we dominated them and also they had to change

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:31.090
their style of life. The primordial taboos
are only understood if people are trying to

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:43.120
understand oneself or else whatever has come
to them through tradition.

00:06:43.889 --> 00:06:50.889
Now, sahaj dharma is little bit different
in the sense that it’s much higher than

00:06:54.539 --> 00:07:01.539
the sahaj ideas that we talk of, but it’s
much higher than even what Shri Krishna said

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:11.729
or Shri Rama said. First, Shri Rama thought,
best is to give them disciplines. People should

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:20.879
be serious about life, have full idea about
their own being, they should respect themselves.

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:31.279
All these things were written down long time
back. Also, people, basically when they were

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:41.460
good people, they understood that whatever
is bad for us, we should not do. These are

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:44.219
primordial taboos.

00:07:44.219 --> 00:07:51.219
Now, these primordial taboos are built in
within us. Now, supposing I say, “Don’t

00:07:53.529 --> 00:08:00.529
drink.” You will go and drink. If I say,
“Don’t tell lies,” you will tell lies.

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:08.430
It’s the human nature, you see, is to go
against primordial taboo, because they think

00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:15.430
now they have freedom, freedom to do what
they like. You are free people. Actually they

00:08:16.249 --> 00:08:23.249
are not. They are under the spell of all the
kinds of allurement, you can call it, or temptations

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:34.960
which are against human life. And it’s very
natural to be a person of dharma. Small children

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:42.330
mostly have it.

00:08:42.330 --> 00:08:48.530
For example, I’ve seen children, they feel
very shy to take out their clothes - even

00:08:48.530 --> 00:08:55.250
small, small boys, I’ve seen. They won’t
take out their clothes in the presence of

00:08:55.250 --> 00:09:02.250
others; they feel shy. So, all these are described
like, Ya Devi, Sarva Butheshu, Lajja Rupena

00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:11.790
Samsthita. So, you should be shy; you should
be humble and respect your body, it’s very

00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:22.480
important in these modern times. Exposure
of body is regarded as a great achievement

00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:29.480
of women. They are trying to become aboriginals,
you see. That time they never had these ideas

00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.970
and they were not so confused, you see. So,
even if their women were scantily dressed,

00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:40.970
it didn’t mean that it was some sort of
a sex or some sort of an attraction for men,

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:51.300
or men behaving in funny manners to show that
they have a special attraction for women.

00:09:54.040 --> 00:10:01.040
I mean, why should you? It is absolutely absurd
that men should be attracted to women and

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:10.760
women should be attracted to men - and on
the road, on the street, you go, you see,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:17.760
just that going on! This adharma is the worst
I think, for it’s a curse. Because after

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:24.060
coming to Sahaja Yoga also people start doing
this nonsense, you know. They should all go

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:29.990
to lunatic asylum, I think, they are no good
for Sahaja Yoga. But dharma gets established

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.140
as soon as you have the light of the spirit.

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:40.140
At the time of Shri Rama, He had to put down
A, B, C, D, E, F. At the time of Moses, also

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:54.870
He had to put down Ten Commandments. But Krishna
thought the other way round - to establish

00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:05.330
a dharma of pure love - pure love. So, because
He wanted that Shri Rama’s taboos were forced

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:18.240
on people, just like Islamic, just like Christians
- never works. So, He thought better to ask

00:11:20.050 --> 00:11:27.050
them in their freedom, they must develop pure
love. Radha, who was with Him as His power,

00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:37.200
is called as Alladhadayini. She’s the one
who gives joy - pure joy!

00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:44.550
So, all these limited type of attractions
end up in trouble. Now, drinking is against

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:54.480
you, you know that. Today they are talking
about tobacco, tomorrow they’ll talk of

00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.860
drinking when they will find so many people
suffering from horrible livers and dying.

00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:07.860
Then they will taboo it. But it’s a natural
taboo for your body. If you do something all

00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:17.090
the time which is not good for you, for your
good life, you are becoming adharma.

00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:28.540
This is to be understood very clearly that
the sahaja dharma is that you are just free

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:43.620
- complete freedom from lust, greed and all
nonsense. You’re above it. You’re above.

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:50.990
This sahaj dharma is above the dharma established
by Shri Krishna or by Shri Rama, because you

00:12:54.180 --> 00:13:01.180
have reached that stage. Is in complete freedom
you have to be dharmic. Whatever is not good

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:10.260
for you, you should not do. I don’t have
to tell you that you don’t do this or you

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:18.640
don’t do that. Whatever I say may not be
acceptable, but immediately your vibrations

00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:20.090
will tell you.

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:27.090
This is sahaj dharma. In the sahaj dharma
you get rid of all kinds of, as they say:

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:35.710
kaama, krodha, mada, matsa, lobha, moha. Means:
lust, anger, attractions, then greed. Greed

00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:54.270
- that’s very important, greed. Greed. And
attractions. Now, if you understand how people

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:10.420
are greedy, greedy for what? This America
is dying of consumerism, you see. Now, see

00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:22.020
the trick of the trade. In America, you can
borrow any amount of money from the bank,

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:29.690
no problem. Now, even if you don’t borrow,
they’ll send you a letter, “Why don’t

00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:37.550
you take twenty thousand checks we are sending
you, why not have it? Ah, very rich you’ll

00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:44.550
become, you see – it’s very nice to take
the loan.” I was told some people used to

00:14:46.610 --> 00:14:53.160
come to Ganapatipule after taking loans. I
said, “Stop that nonsense!” So they take

00:14:53.160 --> 00:15:00.160
the loan and then they come to Ganapatipule.
All the time their mind is: ‘How will I

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:08.090
pay this loan, how will I manage?’ All the
time the attention is distracted, even when

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:13.980
you want to do something good to yourself
of coming to Ganapatipule.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:20.980
So, such a mind is not free. The free mind
is that which has attention completely enlightened

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:32.860
by the spirit. But problem is we are still
rising out of this human bondage to a higher

00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:45.040
life of realization. And when we are going
to that level, we have to realize that we

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:57.090
have to give up all these shackles, all these
horrible things within us. Like a bird, when

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:08.290
it is born out of the egg, shakes out all
the parts of the egg. Your brothers, your

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:16.360
sisters, your father, your mother, your husband.
Everybody - they try to put you down. Now,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:24.060
if they are drinking, they’ll say, “Come
along, you better have something to drink,

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:31.060
you are not social, you are useless, you are
not up to date. What is this nonsense?”

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:38.550
That’s how a fashion starts and this collective
action of fashion didn’t come from Shri

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:44.760
Krishna and not in Sahaj.

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.020
In Sahaj, you are absolutely free from all
these nonsenses. If you want, you can wear

00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:57.020
a good dress, if you don’t want you need
not. You are free. You are free from money

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:08.230
bondage. This is very important. Money bondage
is another thing. I know some Sahaja Yogis

00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:14.870
who came to Sahaja Yoga trying to make money
out of Sahaja Yoga. You came to Sahaja Yoga

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:20.549
for what? To get out of that money bondage.
In the sahaj dharma, to you money is nothing

00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:25.999
but the dust of your feet. Nothing so important.

00:17:25.999 --> 00:17:32.999
Then, we have such a collective sense of accepting
nonsense. That has to be dropped out, specially

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:43.480
in America, I was surprised. Also in England.
A fellow came as a hippie. His hair were looking

00:17:54.850 --> 00:18:01.850
like some monkey. Monkey is better I must
say. I don’t know like what, all put together

00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:10.419
like a, you can say - there is nothing to
compare, I tell you.

00:18:10.419 --> 00:18:13.749
So I asked him, “Why are you having such
hair?”

00:18:13.749 --> 00:18:19.899
He said, “Because I want to be primitive.
Now, we have to get to the primitiveness.”

00:18:19.899 --> 00:18:24.830
I said, “But your brain is modern, what’s
the use of growing your hair like that? You

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:31.259
think you can become primitive? You cannot!”

00:18:31.259 --> 00:18:38.259
Then afterwards I learned that he died. Another
one like that came and he didn’t die, but

00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:48.200
went to lunatic asylum. Like that I met many,
but why do you do it? Because that’s the

00:18:49.570 --> 00:18:50.340
fashion.

00:18:50.340 --> 00:18:57.340
Now Italy, you know, is prospering because
of all kinds of designers. Now there is a

00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:06.249
joke about the n HYPERLINK "http://www.nouveauriche.com/"
ouveau riche people, in Russia especially.

00:19:06.249 --> 00:19:13.249
Russians are not like that, normally. They
don’t accept something because it’s a

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:21.240
fashion.
So, one fellow said that “My God you lost

00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:29.909
your hand in that accident!”
“Doesn’t matter, but I lost my very expensive

00:19:29.909 --> 00:19:32.370
watch from Switzerland.”
“Really? What?”

00:19:32.370 --> 00:19:39.370
“It was a Rolex.”
Doesn’t matter if the hand is gone. The

00:19:40.220 --> 00:19:46.620
Rolex is gone - Rolex is the fashion.

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:50.690
So these are n HYPERLINK "http://www.nouveauriche.com/"
ouveau riche people who have money.

00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:54.120
(Dog is on the stage)

00:19:54.120 --> 00:20:01.120
Come along. Come along. Sit down. Sit down.
Now, go down.

00:20:05.139 --> 00:20:12.139
They (the dogs) don’t form any fashions,
I have not seen dogs taken to any fashions.

00:20:14.159 --> 00:20:21.159
Monkeys taking, I mean, supposing, you see
the Italian designers make something special

00:20:21.809 --> 00:20:28.809
for them, they won’t think much of it. Maybe
their masters might buy, but not these animals.

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:37.740
Now, we don’t have to become animals of
course, but we don’t also have to become

00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.149
slaves of fashions.

00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:46.149
So there are some shops which are very expensive.
Why? Because they are designers. So you move

00:20:47.779 --> 00:20:52.320
about telling everybody, “See, I am wearing
this thing from a designer shop, this is from

00:20:52.320 --> 00:20:59.320
designer shop.” That means, what about you?
You have no sense of designs; you have no

00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:06.700
sense of understanding what you need and what
you don’t need. And nowadays most of them

00:21:07.499 --> 00:21:13.909
are in jail also, sorry to say, but they have
money and they have made money by befooling

00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:14.740
you.

00:21:14.740 --> 00:21:21.740
Specially in America I was surprised that
they were selling most of the things which

00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:27.999
were coming from Italy - designs, Italian
designs, written that Italian design so they

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:34.999
were buying it, Italian design. I was surprised
that such artistic things they create that

00:21:38.690 --> 00:21:45.690
are available everywhere, such beautiful things.
But what they believe in is some sort of a

00:21:48.659 --> 00:21:55.659
group madness, everybody wearing the same
kind of design is from this or that. This

00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.889
is not sahaj dharma. You are not slaves of
anything. You are free people. You have not

00:22:02.889 --> 00:22:09.889
to accept any design or anything. Ah, it is
there, is there! Let the stupid follow that.

00:22:10.389 --> 00:22:12.279
We are Sahaja Yogis.

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:19.019
Now, this also prevails among people who are
supposed to be sadhus, they all dress up the

00:22:19.019 --> 00:22:26.019
same way. How can you make out who is who?
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want you to dress

00:22:27.149 --> 00:22:33.480
up the same way, look the same way, cut your
hair the same way. No. You have to be individuals,

00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:40.480
because you are free, but that doesn’t mean
- freedom is always supported by wisdom - that

00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:49.100
doesn’t mean that you do what you like.
All kinds of funny things happen when a person

00:22:50.850 --> 00:22:57.850
doesn’t know what is the light of the spirit.
In the light of the spirit, you don’t get

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:06.230
involved into this kind of collective madness
that is going on. We are so collective in

00:23:06.789 --> 00:23:12.379
mad things. I wish they could be collective
more in wise things.

00:23:12.379 --> 00:23:19.379
Wisdom is very important, and a joy-giving
quality of Radhaji - alladhadayini shakti

00:23:19.899 --> 00:23:26.899
- has to come within us. Means, when we meet
another person in the collectivity, another

00:23:29.470 --> 00:23:36.470
person should feel happy with you. So He taught
the dharma of love. Love is not there if you

00:23:40.929 --> 00:23:47.929
discard because he is black or because he
is brown, because he is white. It’s very

00:23:49.779 --> 00:23:56.779
superficial - what is black, white and yellow?
I don’t understand. Here they go to the

00:23:58.059 --> 00:24:05.059
sea shores to make themselves black and there
they say, “we don’t want to have any blacks,”

00:24:06.149 --> 00:24:13.149
specially for Americans. I think this kind
of separation I found there, among the blacks

00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:19.429
and the whites, I really wept.

00:24:19.429 --> 00:24:24.919
I went to Harlem. Sahaja yogis said, “Mother
will you go to Harlem?”

00:24:24.919 --> 00:24:30.379
I said, “Why not, I’m black. If you call
Me black, I’m black. If you call Me white,

00:24:30.379 --> 00:24:35.499
I’m white. If you call Me yellow, I’m
yellow, so I’m going.”

00:24:35.499 --> 00:24:39.700
And there I had a lecture, you know, so many
people were there, really I cannot forget.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:46.700
It is one of the most famous place that there
is built in that hall and the same hall is

00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:56.549
built in Australia where I had addressed many
people. I thought, just look at this! They

00:24:59.179 --> 00:25:05.100
said, “Mother, the Australians copied from
us.” Now, these people, so sweet, so beautiful,

00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:12.100
I tell you. I could see their heart, I could
feel it and the fellow was trying to compare,

00:25:12.629 --> 00:25:16.899
after My lecture he just came, he hugged Me,
kissed Me. I mean, he would have even minced

00:25:16.899 --> 00:25:23.639
Me, little boy about twenty-two years of age
- such love he felt. And he said, “Mother,

00:25:23.639 --> 00:25:30.639
next time You come, You are going to come
to Harlem.” But I am told that hall is closed.

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:38.259
So the Americans system somehow or another
goes against democracy, not only against democracy

00:25:41.989 --> 00:25:48.989
but against what Abraham Lincoln wanted. They
had such a great man there and there is a

00:25:53.580 --> 00:26:00.580
little street I saw in his name. Of course
in Washington they say they have some nice,

00:26:01.749 --> 00:26:08.749
beautiful statues. But otherwise his principles
are finished; his ideals are finished because

00:26:13.649 --> 00:26:20.649
somehow or other, some people came and wrote
against - England especially - against the

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:30.100
black people. What business they have to write
against something that is created by God?

00:26:33.429 --> 00:26:40.429
If there are the same colors everywhere, they
all will look like military people. They have

00:26:40.629 --> 00:26:46.850
to have different colors; they have to have
different hues. See, look at the trees; look

00:26:46.850 --> 00:26:53.850
at the flowers. Look at the different hues
the sky has, just to make us happy – alladha.

00:26:56.669 --> 00:27:03.669
What gives you happiness is variety. Variety
is a sign of beauty. If there is no variety,

00:27:05.509 --> 00:27:12.509
it’s so boring I tell you, so very boring.
But they are very proud of it and they think

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:19.110
no end of themselves. They think they are
very great people; they have a sense of superiority,

00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:26.110
because they have a certain type of nose or
maybe certain type of lips or maybe certain

00:27:26.799 --> 00:27:33.360
types of hair. Such stupid things they are
and you join hands with them? How can you

00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:40.210
join hands with them? You want your freedom?
Then be a free person. In the freedom you

00:27:40.210 --> 00:27:45.049
have to have variety, very important.

00:27:45.049 --> 00:27:52.049
I would say that now the Sahaja Yogis who
are going back to America should have a new

00:27:52.119 --> 00:27:59.119
style of drive; go to the black people. I
was very happy to see the South American seminar

00:28:01.029 --> 00:28:08.029
that they had taken specially to aboriginal
people. They went and met them. I have met

00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:15.840
them also and I was so surprised that they
immediately said, “Mother, You are spiritual,

00:28:16.159 --> 00:28:19.720
we know, but can You solve our problem?”

00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.989
I said, “What’s your problem?”

00:28:20.989 --> 00:28:27.230
“Very simple, we have a land – all right,
then - very little land, five, six acres of

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:34.230
land that belongs to us where the sage grows.”
Sage is a kind of a, according to them, is

00:28:36.559 --> 00:28:43.559
a holy plant. All right. “Now, we always
meet, all of us, there for different festivals

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:49.710
because we regard that land as a holy land.”
They know so many things, you know. This is

00:28:49.710 --> 00:28:56.690
a holy land; there were vibrations for that.
So they always used to meet, so natural.

00:28:56.690 --> 00:29:00.690
“So, what has happened now, what is your
problem?

00:29:00.690 --> 00:29:06.049
“The government has sold this land, this
American government, to an Indian.”

00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:08.320
I said, “To an Indian?”

00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.970
“Yes, so can you request this Indian to
return it to us, we’ll pay him the money.”

00:29:12.970 --> 00:29:17.289
I said, “What’s the name of the Indian?”
They told me the name, I said, “My God!

00:29:17.289 --> 00:29:24.289
He is a Sindhi, Sindhi! He won’t leave you
even one single pai, is he going to give you

00:29:24.929 --> 00:29:31.519
this? I’m sorry, I may be divine or I may
be anything, I can’t help you.”

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:37.169
But I was surprised nobody raised a voice
against it. They should have raised voice.

00:29:37.169 --> 00:29:41.929
They should have told the government, “Please
return their land. Why do you want to have

00:29:41.929 --> 00:29:48.179
it? Why want to grab it?” As it is all the
Americans are immigrants. They don’t belong

00:29:48.179 --> 00:29:55.179
to that place, that they were not owners of
that place, that ground - they are immigrants.

00:29:57.679 --> 00:30:02.029
So they have no right to keep somebody’s
land like that and then to think they are

00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:07.009
superior. It’s very nice, somebody enters
your house and thinks he is very superior

00:30:07.009 --> 00:30:11.029
and drives out all the people of the family.

00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:17.299
That is what has happened in America and just
opposite is sahaj dharma. With sahaj dharma,

00:30:17.299 --> 00:30:24.299
you take people into your heart, you love
them. Your love flows all the time; your compassion

00:30:28.169 --> 00:30:34.460
flows all the time. To Me it’s a problem,
this body is more compassionate than Myself.

00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:40.090
I don’t even think of compassion and this
body just grasps everything. It wants to solve

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:46.960
the problem of others, but I don’t think
you can have that kind of a body, you shouldn’t

00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:52.239
have. But, at least you should have a heart
which is open.

00:30:52.239 --> 00:30:59.239
You see on the street somebody who is a dark
fellow. I like about the black Americans that

00:30:59.279 --> 00:31:06.279
once I got down in one airport, so one gentleman,
black gentleman, “Hello darling, how are

00:31:10.179 --> 00:31:13.999
You? How are You here? Very happy to see You!”

00:31:13.999 --> 00:31:17.409
“I’m happy to see you. How are you?”

00:31:17.409 --> 00:31:24.409
Then once I was traveling in - what was the
airport? Ursula was with Me. So he looked

00:31:26.789 --> 00:31:33.789
at Me, one fellow, very tall, hefty, fat,
you know. He said, “Ah! Are You back again?”

00:31:35.779 --> 00:31:40.989
I said, “I’m back. You know Me?”

00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:47.989
“Of course, of course, I know you.” He
had never met Me, I had never known him. But

00:31:50.350 --> 00:31:55.830
I felt happy, I felt very happy. That’s
the best way to meet people.

00:31:55.830 --> 00:32:01.840
Supposing you are walking on the street, you
see some black gentleman going. It’s a terrible

00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:06.649
life there, I tell you; it’s a terrible
life for them. I’ve known, I’ve read books

00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:12.929
on them, I’ve cried and wept and I felt
very sorry. So, as a Sahaja yogi, you should

00:32:12.929 --> 00:32:18.989
just jump at them and you should say, “Hello,
how are you?” Shake hands with them. They

00:32:18.989 --> 00:32:25.989
won’t cut your throat, I can tell you this.
In criminality, I don’t know who is more

00:32:27.090 --> 00:32:32.779
criminal in America, whether they are the
blacks or the whites, competing. But, if you

00:32:32.779 --> 00:32:38.929
are kind and if you are loving, you can remove
that part of criminality which is within them

00:32:38.929 --> 00:32:43.119
because hatred can be only washed away by
pure love.

00:32:43.119 --> 00:32:50.119
But people think they are very cunning, very
superior - in cunningness, of course. Otherwise,

00:32:55.309 --> 00:33:00.499
what is their superiority? Only this complexion,
this white complexion is the worst of all.

00:33:00.499 --> 00:33:07.249
I was very fair, very fair, till I got married,
or for some time, and then I started becoming

00:33:07.249 --> 00:33:13.619
darker and darker. Because white complexion
gets all kinds of, see, the light you put

00:33:13.619 --> 00:33:20.269
on Me, I absorb, I get a black spot. So it’s
not a very great thing to be white, I don’t

00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:27.269
think so. It looks very funny and pale and
joyless. But no use going to the sea, making

00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:34.820
your body, I think brown - brown, not so black,
brown and then suffering from cancer of the

00:33:38.649 --> 00:33:44.229
skin. This kind of stupidity is also very
much fashionable.

00:33:44.229 --> 00:33:51.229
Now, in collectivity, how much do we get impressed
by these we should be on the watch. I saw

00:33:54.570 --> 00:33:56.850
My granddaughter was wearing a sleeveless
dress.

00:33:56.850 --> 00:34:00.070
I told her, “Better you shouldn’t wear
a sleeveless dress.”

00:34:00.070 --> 00:34:03.019
She says, “It’s very hot, I feel very
hot.”

00:34:03.019 --> 00:34:08.710
She’s young. I said, “But see, these are
two very important chakras. If you expose

00:34:08.710 --> 00:34:15.710
them, then you’ll have problem.” She doesn’t
like to wear dresses which are above the knee,

00:34:18.590 --> 00:34:20.770
but she says people wear even above the knee.

00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:26.859
I said, “Knees, they are very important
chakras, we should keep them clothed, otherwise

00:34:26.859 --> 00:34:32.169
if they are affected, we’ll have knee trouble.”

00:34:32.169 --> 00:34:37.710
Immediately she changed, immediately. “Mother,
I’ll wear blouse from inside and something

00:34:37.710 --> 00:34:44.710
from outside.” Immediately. Because she
knew this is a natural primordial taboo that

00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:52.990
we should not expose ours - these two chakras
and these chakras. But, nowadays, the more

00:34:57.609 --> 00:35:04.609
you have long legs, I don’t know, they have
shorter clothes. And I don’t understand

00:35:06.319 --> 00:35:13.319
what is in the legs, the whole beauty is in
the legs or what?

00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:21.410
So, I’ve met one lady who traveled with
Me. She was wearing a burqa because she was

00:35:21.470 --> 00:35:28.470
a Muslim. And by the time we landed in London,
she took out the burqa and the dress was much

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:35.559
above the knees. I said, “What kind of Muslim
woman is she? She’s worse than even Christians

00:35:36.670 --> 00:35:43.670
because they wouldn’t wear such a thing,
you know, to come out of the aeroplane, you

00:35:44.410 --> 00:35:51.410
have to come down on the staircase.” No
lajja, no shame, nothing, shamelessness!

00:35:53.869 --> 00:36:00.869
So, sahaj dharma is that you have shame, you
have sense of shame. What you talk to others,

00:36:02.569 --> 00:36:09.569
what you say to others, how you behave towards
them, in the sahaj dharma is alladhadayini.

00:36:09.770 --> 00:36:16.770
If something is not alladhadayini, keep quiet.
Don’t say. What is the need? What is there

00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:26.480
to be sarcastic? Showing off your brains in
your sarcasm. It’s not a sign of good breeding

00:36:31.819 --> 00:36:38.819
that you talk sarcastically to others in a
sharp way. But if you talk sweetly, what’s

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:47.430
the harm? This sweetness comes from Radhaji.
Now, of course they have misused Her and made

00:36:49.369 --> 00:36:56.369
Her into a sort of a Romeo-Juliet business.
It was not that. She was a very pure woman

00:36:57.380 --> 00:37:04.380
and She was Mahalakshmi. So, to be a Mahalaksmi,
after coming to Sahaja Yoga, you should know

00:37:07.970 --> 00:37:14.970
that you should dress up in a way that’s
perfectly all right. Once I remember, I was

00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:23.010
in a big party and one gentleman came and
he sat down, “Aaaaaah!”

00:37:23.470 --> 00:37:26.150
I said, “What happened?”

00:37:26.150 --> 00:37:33.150
“What a relief, Mother, Mrs. Shrivastava,
to see You. See these women, I’m fed up.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.480
But You came, I felt such a relief.”

00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.819
I said, “What is so relieving?”

00:37:43.819 --> 00:37:46.410
“You are so serene.”

00:37:46.410 --> 00:37:53.410
So, women are serene in sahaj dharma. They
are not stupid, frivolous, laughing at anything.

00:37:56.740 --> 00:38:03.740
That’s not the way for a woman. Anything
happens, they must laugh. I mean, there is

00:38:06.829 --> 00:38:10.109
something laughable, all right, but some things
are not even laughable, they'll laugh. That’s

00:38:10.109 --> 00:38:17.109
not the way. That can be ridiculous also,
can ridicule others. But laugh of appreciation,

00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:26.160
laugh of enjoyment, is so pure and creates
such beautiful atmosphere. I think the whole

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:36.760
ecological problem is in our brains – [Hindi
words]. It is not outside. It is inside us,

00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:42.920
which is reflected outside.

00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:49.500
In Ganesha Puja I’m going to tell you how
we are so closely related to Mother Earth

00:38:49.500 --> 00:38:56.500
and how the Mother Earth and the atmosphere
reacts to our behavior, to how we live. In

00:38:58.609 --> 00:39:05.609
the sahaj dharma, you give up lust and greed
very easily, that I know. I mean if they can’t

00:39:06.039 --> 00:39:11.480
even give up that, then they should not call
themselves Sahaja yogis. The first thing you

00:39:11.480 --> 00:39:18.480
give up is lust and greed. I find it among
young people now, that those who come to Sahaja

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:26.890
Yoga become really very free people. They
don’t run after women. Women don’t run

00:39:31.180 --> 00:39:38.010
after men. They are together, they sit together,
talk together, laugh together, but it is purity

00:39:38.010 --> 00:39:45.010
that is here. In the Koran it’s described
that “When Kiyama will come, beautiful women

00:39:48.450 --> 00:39:54.579
and beautiful men will be there, but they’ll
have no lust and greed, they’ll be pure.”

00:39:54.579 --> 00:40:01.579
Is today, you can see that that lust and greed
is finished in most of it, most of you. Automatically

00:40:05.770 --> 00:40:12.770
it is finished and now you can see for yourself
that you’re free of this bondage.

00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:20.910
Then our marriages are coming tomorrow. In
the sahaj dharma, first thing is very important

00:40:33.130 --> 00:40:40.130
is forgiveness. If somebody cannot forgive,
then he cannot be a Sahaja yogi. Forgiveness.

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:51.470
How this forgiveness comes in is by forgetting
the past. Otherwise you’ll go on saying,

00:40:52.819 --> 00:40:58.730
“This person tortured me, that person tortured
me, he was very mean to me, he was that to

00:40:58.730 --> 00:41:05.730
me, he did this to me.” Shows that you are
not of that caliber to understand Sahaja Yoga

00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:12.160
- because you cannot forgive. What is there
to remember? The present is the best. Now

00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:18.450
if you are sitting here with Me, enjoying
the alladhadayini shakti, that time if you

00:41:18.450 --> 00:41:25.450
are thinking about the past, shows what? That
you are not of the caliber. To be the caliber

00:41:27.609 --> 00:41:34.609
of Sahaja Yoga, you should be free of your
past. Finished. There's no need to confess.

00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:42.569
I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote
letters to Me of confessions and I just said,

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:47.960
“Baba, just burn these letters. I don’t
remember. I don’t want to read anything

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:48.510
about anything.”

00:41:48.510 --> 00:41:54.990
So, there should be forgiveness. If there
is forgiveness, you’ll be surprised, you’ll

00:41:54.990 --> 00:42:01.339
feel very relieved and your married life will
be very happy. But if you try to remember

00:42:01.339 --> 00:42:07.859
something – all right, some marriages are
really, really very difficult, all right,

00:42:07.859 --> 00:42:14.859
so you get out. In Sahaja Yoga we have allowed
complete divorce, but must be with some reason,

00:42:14.869 --> 00:42:18.420
not because you think something is superior.

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:24.390
Now we have banned many countries from where
we don’t want to have girls or from where

00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:29.660
we don’t want to have boys. What is the
reason? With experience we have learned, they

00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:36.660
are not marriage substance. Now, then better
not marry, and if you marry then live like

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:49.740
an ideal Sahaja Yogi. Also, if you are a Sahaja
Yogini, then you can carry on very much better

00:42:51.799 --> 00:42:54.740
by forgiving all the time.

00:42:54.740 --> 00:43:01.740
Every time, when people tell Me, “My Mother,
You see You must help me.”

00:43:01.950 --> 00:43:02.400
“Why?”

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.119
“Because, You know my husband doesn’t
give me any money.”

00:43:05.119 --> 00:43:09.619
I said, “Give him up. I don’t mind. He
must give you money. Why doesn’t he give

00:43:09.619 --> 00:43:10.520
you money?”

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:15.670
If you talk to the husband, he’ll say, “Mother,
she’s very extravagant.”

00:43:15.670 --> 00:43:21.670
I said, “You better give up Sahaja Yoga
both of you and do what you like.”

00:43:21.670 --> 00:43:28.670
In sahaj dharma, the husband-wife’s relation
should be really romantic, should be really

00:43:29.619 --> 00:43:36.069
beautiful. It is not, you know, we talk of
love and all that here, very rarely people

00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:42.059
fall in love and carry on with it. It’s
a blessing if you really get that kind of

00:43:42.059 --> 00:43:49.059
a feeling. But mostly it is a curse. So to
fall in love is very good but that doesn’t

00:43:53.230 --> 00:44:00.230
mean you forget that you are a Sahaja Yogi.
In that, Sahaja Yoga helps a lot, I think,

00:44:00.809 --> 00:44:07.809
in your married life. Same dharma is for your
children, that you bring up your children

00:44:08.660 --> 00:44:15.660
not troubling them too much, but into a free
land. Let them use their wisdom. Sometimes

00:44:16.369 --> 00:44:21.970
I know children go astray and try to follow
wrong things. Then you must correct them,

00:44:21.970 --> 00:44:28.200
you must tell them, it’s your duty. They
were not born out of the trees but they were

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:33.990
born here, from the parents. So it’s the
duty of the parents to tell them that this

00:44:33.990 --> 00:44:40.210
is wrong and this should not be done. It’s
a very wrong thing, you should correct them

00:44:40.210 --> 00:44:44.869
and that correction should be in a Sahaj way.

00:44:44.869 --> 00:44:51.869
I’ll tell you an example. I had a problem
once with somebody coming to Me and saying,

00:44:57.569 --> 00:45:04.390
“Mother, I can’t do without smoking, I
have to smoke.”

00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:11.339
I said, “Better smoke then, but you can’t
be a Sahaja Yogi, because smoking Sahaja Yogi

00:45:11.339 --> 00:45:16.730
is a funny caricature, you know, I can’t
think of a Sahaja Yogi smoking. How will I

00:45:16.730 --> 00:45:18.839
look if I start smoking like that?”

00:45:18.839 --> 00:45:20.200
“Ah, horrible.”

00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:27.200
I said, “Then if you are My son, you cannot
smoke, it looks bad.” He gave up smoking,

00:45:30.319 --> 00:45:31.440
can you imagine?

00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:37.609
So, dealing with children, always make yourself
an example, yourself part and parcel of that

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:44.609
event. So the children don’t feel, you know.
This is something that I have talked many

00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:57.230
a times. Children is one thing, I tell you,
they can give up everything but not your love.

00:45:58.339 --> 00:46:05.339
If they know you love them they will not accept
anything that will make you not love - not

00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:17.150
love them. This is for definite, because children
are the best people who know about love.

00:46:20.740 --> 00:46:25.690
Of course, I don’t know, I feel that in
English language, I didn’t see many books

00:46:25.690 --> 00:46:32.119
about children written beautiful, beautiful
things. There was one book that was published

00:46:32.119 --> 00:46:38.380
when I was in London: The children talking
about the politicians, and they published

00:46:38.380 --> 00:46:44.650
I think, 5000 books and that very same day
it was finished. So, talk to children, talk

00:46:44.650 --> 00:46:50.750
to them. You’ll be amazed, they are full
of honey. They have such nice, nice things

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:57.750
with them and when they talk like that, then
you are amazed how they say things, how they

00:46:59.099 --> 00:47:06.099
talk of Sahaj, how they are expressing their
spiritual strength.

00:47:06.799 --> 00:47:13.799
Now, we have many very good children and also
they are absolutely Sahaj. One boy came and

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.220
he just prostrated himself before Me.

00:47:24.220 --> 00:47:27.400
So, I said, “Why you did it?”

00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:30.910
“No, I was getting cool vibrations, Mother
from You, so I did it.”

00:47:30.910 --> 00:47:33.549
“Is it, you like it?”

00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:36.799
“Of course!”

00:47:36.799 --> 00:47:39.410
“More than chocolate?”

00:47:39.410 --> 00:47:40.809
“Of course!”

00:47:40.809 --> 00:47:45.210
I was surprised. “What? You eat them or
what?”

00:47:45.210 --> 00:47:52.210
“No need to eat, no, no, you feel so happy
inside and I feel, Mother, You are putting

00:47:53.359 --> 00:47:56.980
Your hand on my heart and trying to console
me.”

00:47:56.980 --> 00:47:59.869
Surprised. “And where is your heart?”

00:47:59.869 --> 00:48:06.869
He said, “Here, here is my heart, I feel
it here.” Just imagine, what love and what

00:48:08.059 --> 00:48:13.260
understanding of Sahaja Yoga! For these little
children who are below even five years.

00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:20.260
Now, you are all grown up children of Mine
and I want you to know all the beauties that

00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:28.210
are within you, that you have to enjoy. First
of all, learn to laugh at yourself. That’s

00:48:28.210 --> 00:48:35.210
the best way to enjoy yourself, you know.
And not to spend much time on the mirror,

00:48:37.849 --> 00:48:43.039
in the mirror, that’s another way. You spend
too much on the mirror, then something wrong

00:48:43.039 --> 00:48:47.720
with you. I think, personally, that it’s
a kind of a possession maybe. So, what you

00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:54.720
should see inside, “Are we sahaj dharmis?
Mother has established sahaj dharma, much

00:48:58.650 --> 00:49:04.430
more than what Krishna wanted to establish.
He wanted to establish the dharma of love

00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:11.430
which of course we have, but apart from that
we have so many other beautiful facets and

00:49:12.819 --> 00:49:19.819
such beautiful things within our personality
that we have forgotten to enjoy.”

00:49:20.029 --> 00:49:27.029
So, the attention should be on your own qualities,
on your own personality, and then you’ll

00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:38.130
be amazed how your personality is giving you
joy, giving you alladha, giving you so much

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:45.910
of patience with others.

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:52.910
To Me the whole thing looks like sometimes
a joke, because nothing so serious. It’s

00:49:54.960 --> 00:50:01.960
not a Rama’s type that you have to be serious.
I don’t have to kill anybody. I don’t

00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:09.809
use any weapons in this lifetime. Without
weapons if things are solved, what can you

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.519
do?

00:50:10.519 --> 00:50:16.230
But you must try to see the beauty as Sahaja
Yogis. You should be sensitive to see how

00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:23.230
you have been helped, how you have been guided,
how you have been blessed. This is sahaj dharma.

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:31.680
If you cannot know that, then you live on
a very low level. I mean, it’s not fault

00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:38.680
of Sahaja Yoga, but it’s your style, you
are not sensitive. Supposing somebody is not

00:50:40.849 --> 00:50:47.849
- does not burn his hand. So what will you
do? He has no sense, he has no sensitivity,

00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:58.109
he cannot feel. He can drink, he can smoke,
he can do everything and still he's existing,

00:50:59.029 --> 00:51:04.069
all right. Must be a rakshasa, I think or
I don’t know what to say.

00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:11.069
So, we have to take example from other good
Sahaja Yogis and not from the bad ones and

00:51:13.849 --> 00:51:20.849
how do we proceed in enjoyment - which is
a ocean, just a ocean. For example, now, I

00:51:23.329 --> 00:51:29.880
came, everybody was trying to fan. But also
in the West another problem is they like to

00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:35.750
live in hermetically-sealed rooms, hermetically-sealed
cars, they are very afraid of draft, I don’t

00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:41.279
know, as if they’ll be blown away or what
will happen to them. They don’t want draft.

00:51:41.279 --> 00:51:48.279
I mean draft is not coming from some iceberg.
So, they don’t believe in the fresh air

00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:55.640
at all and that’s one other reason that
people are very suffocating sometimes, you

00:51:56.760 --> 00:52:01.789
know, they just suffocate. They are used to
a suffocating life.

00:52:01.789 --> 00:52:08.789
Once I was in India, I was very hot, so somebody
was driving Me, but the person who was there

00:52:09.250 --> 00:52:14.289
was from Western country. He said, “Don’t
open - don’t open the window.”

00:52:14.289 --> 00:52:15.569
I said, “Why?”

00:52:15.569 --> 00:52:16.849
“There’s a draft.”

00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:23.760
I said, “In this country, in India people
live in the open - what is a draft? What draft

00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:28.740
you are talking about?” You can’t open
the door, you can’t open the window, you

00:52:28.740 --> 00:52:34.720
can’t open anything, if you open anything,
they’ll be all dead, you see – as if.

00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.029
So open yourself!

00:52:37.029 --> 00:52:44.029
As it is about the nature, also it is in their
private lives. They don’t want to open.

00:52:49.390 --> 00:52:54.950
If somebody comes to their house, “Oh my
God, now we’ll have to share the wines,

00:52:54.950 --> 00:53:01.950
we’ll have to share the foods” They cannot
share. They cannot share. That is most uncollective.

00:53:10.869 --> 00:53:17.400
But in India, I must say, people have a good
sharing capacity because they are still primitive,

00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:24.400
they are still primordial, yet not gone out
of the way to satisfy their own ego. But I

00:53:30.670 --> 00:53:37.670
think somehow or other in India, people like
to share. If you want to please any Indian,

00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:50.089
you tell them, tomorrow I’ll come and have
food with you. His wife will jump. She’ll

00:53:50.089 --> 00:53:57.089
say, “Now what do you like, tell me, what
food do you like?” She will jump. But otherwise,

00:54:00.109 --> 00:54:05.670
what happens, as soon as you say he’s coming
for food, the wife will say, “No, no, I

00:54:05.670 --> 00:54:12.670
am going to my mother.” Immediately she’ll
have a program. I just don’t understand.

00:54:19.029 --> 00:54:25.480
They’ll have beautiful houses, very clean,
very beautiful, everything, but if somebody

00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:32.480
comes to their house, they get a shock as
if electricity has entered. So, for whom is

00:54:34.769 --> 00:54:36.640
all this?

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:43.640
To show off, they will borrow money from the
banks. Even Indians in America they do. They

00:54:44.269 --> 00:54:51.269
want to have three Mercedes, four houses - for
what? Borrowing money with borrowing money

00:54:53.490 --> 00:55:00.490
they live. Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow
any money. There’s no need, you can do away

00:55:02.450 --> 00:55:09.450
with things. Why to have so many cars? Nowadays,
people don’t even walk at all. We used to

00:55:11.799 --> 00:55:18.799
go to our school, My father had a car in India
- nothing doing. We had to walk. We used to

00:55:19.279 --> 00:55:26.230
climb one mountain. It was about five miles,
the school - every morning. Then in the night,

00:55:26.230 --> 00:55:33.230
in the evening, the car used to come, and
I would walk with My bare feet, because so

00:55:35.130 --> 00:55:42.130
much vibrations and on the chappals, I thought
were cutting my vibrations, so I used to have

00:55:42.519 --> 00:55:49.140
chappals in My hand and walk. One day we had
a new driver, My father sent him. He said,

00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:54.589
“How will I know who is the daughter.”
He said, “Any girl with the chappals in

00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:58.890
Her hand is the one whom you have to bring.”

00:55:58.890 --> 00:56:05.890
So, it is to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy
your generosity. It’s very important. And

00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:15.130
not to side with anyone. You are not identified
with anyone.

00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:21.490
It’s much better now, I think, because since
you have taken to sahaj dharma, I’ve seen

00:56:21.490 --> 00:56:25.829
English will tell you what’s wrong with
English. Swiss will tell you what’s wrong

00:56:25.829 --> 00:56:30.480
with Swiss. Indians will tell you what’s
wrong with Indians. Actually, I learned from

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:35.039
them. I don’t know these things are there.
Russians will tell you what’s wrong with

00:56:35.039 --> 00:56:42.039
Russians. They immediately start seeing, “What’s
wrong with us? Where do we lack in this?”

00:56:45.109 --> 00:56:52.109
Because the collectivity of being in one country,
say as an Indian, we see now, what’s happening

00:56:55.299 --> 00:57:02.069
in India, all corrupt, horrible, this, that.
So, I said, “All right, if you don’t like

00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:06.759
India, why don’t you go somewhere else?”
No, no, no, that - we will stay here, but

00:57:06.759 --> 00:57:13.009
this is a very corrupt government they are,
it’s very bad, this, that. Anywhere you

00:57:13.009 --> 00:57:20.009
go, you will find immediately they see - because
you don’t know they are now chosen to change

00:57:23.029 --> 00:57:24.849
their country.

00:57:24.849 --> 00:57:31.849
I’ve taken up many questions now, of India
and I’m going to start working on that level.

00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:41.440
We've already started, in a way, for the destitute
women, then for other type of poverty and

00:57:43.200 --> 00:57:49.180
all that. Just by saying, remove poverty,
poverty cannot be lost. You have to have feeling

00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:56.180
for the poor, then only - but you get with
more that feeling because you are an Indian.

00:57:56.349 --> 00:58:03.349
You are an Indian, so what? Your own brothers,
sisters starving. You get that very deep feeling

00:58:05.019 --> 00:58:09.410
within you if you are a sahaj dharmi.

00:58:09.410 --> 00:58:15.390
So, this is the new dharma we have established
now in this world. A new race, with a new

00:58:15.390 --> 00:58:22.390
dharma, which is much above - even Shri Krishna’s
vision is coming true. He describes in the

00:58:24.579 --> 00:58:30.849
beginning. I think, He was not a good salesman,
because He describes the best first. You see

00:58:30.849 --> 00:58:37.849
the salesman first will start from two rupees,
then go onward to two thousand. But He first

00:58:38.589 --> 00:58:45.319
told us that you have to become Sthita Pragya,
means Sahaja Yogi - and then Shri Krishna

00:58:45.319 --> 00:58:52.049
was asked a question by Arjuna, “What is
a Sthita Pragya?” Then He describes a Sahaja

00:58:52.049 --> 00:58:59.049
Yogi, that He describes before, first chapter,
second chapter is that, now. Then the questions

00:59:00.220 --> 00:59:03.819
start. You know, Arjuna was a great questioner,
I think.

00:59:03.819 --> 00:59:09.069
So, he starts asking questions, “Then what
about this and what about that and what about

00:59:09.069 --> 00:59:09.339
that?”

00:59:09.339 --> 00:59:16.339
So He goes on explaining to him that “You
see, this is all just a maya, this is all

00:59:17.220 --> 00:59:24.220
an illusion you have. Get out of this illusion.
If once you get out of this illusion,” because

00:59:24.819 --> 00:59:31.339
Arjuna said, “They are my relations, they
are my teachers. How can I kill them?”

00:59:31.339 --> 00:59:36.569
So, Krishna says, “Nobody is killed.”
He said, “Nobody is killed, but they are

00:59:36.569 --> 00:59:42.940
being killed because they are not following
the satya dharma, so it’s all right. What

00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:47.099
is your brother, what is your sister? They
are not following the satya dharma, so you

00:59:47.099 --> 00:59:53.329
have nothing to do with them. If you can correct
them and help them, it’s all right, otherwise

00:59:53.329 --> 00:59:54.089
forget them.”

00:59:54.089 --> 01:00:01.089
First, deal with people who are straight.
Like we should say that we must deal with

01:00:01.259 --> 01:00:08.259
people who are simple, innocent and then you
can take to difficult people when you are

01:00:08.529 --> 01:00:12.680
that good. Otherwise you’ll come here saying,
“Mother, I have caught this, I have caught

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:19.680
that.” So, in sahaj dharma, you being the
spirit, you also know about others, very well

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:25.789
and you can make it out, who is who, what
chakras they are catching.

01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:32.789
But the trouble in America, I found that Sahaja
Yogis used to, just could go and tell somebody,

01:00:34.410 --> 01:00:40.549
“You are catching on this chakra.” Now,
he has come for the first time and you tell

01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:42.079
him, “You, you are very egoistical.”

01:00:42.079 --> 01:00:44.240
He says, “How do you know?”

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.869
“Your Agnya is catching.” Maybe, his own
Agnya might be catching.

01:00:47.869 --> 01:00:54.869
Is this the way to receive a new person? Is
this the way to talk to a new person? See,

01:00:55.140 --> 01:01:00.950
on the contrary, you should say, “Come,
sit down, very nice, you are very great,”

01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:07.390
see? Because they are still ignorant, so they
like some sort of buttering, as you call it,

01:01:07.390 --> 01:01:14.390
you see, we call it chaplusi. Then, gradually,
because you are doing this just to make him

01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:21.569
a Sahaja Yogi, because you love him. Basically
that is the reason. But as soon as somebody

01:01:21.569 --> 01:01:26.789
comes in, if you tell him, “This is wrong
with you, that’s wrong with you.” This

01:01:26.789 --> 01:01:33.789
is not a pope’s business where you go on
telling people what’s wrong with them, go

01:01:33.970 --> 01:01:40.970
and confess to all these silly people. It’s
not that. What we have to show that you have

01:01:41.690 --> 01:01:48.690
fallen in love with that person; you are nice
to that person because you like that person.

01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:54.990
Then gradually you pull him up. But as soon
as he comes you give him one shock, so finished.

01:01:54.990 --> 01:01:57.839
How can you have good relations?

01:01:57.839 --> 01:02:01.829
Americans have to learn this. I don’t know
why Americans think they are very superior

01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:08.829
people. I tell you for wisdom, I would not
say they are so good. It’s completely lacking

01:02:09.609 --> 01:02:16.609
– wisdom in them. And they misunderstand
people very fast. Start judging others, is

01:02:18.480 --> 01:02:25.480
not the way you can have sahaj dharma. Sahaj
dharma is: you are your own. You are in your

01:02:25.980 --> 01:02:32.190
own, you are in your own realm and in your
happiness and joy. Where is the time to criticize

01:02:32.190 --> 01:02:33.279
others?

01:02:33.279 --> 01:02:40.279
So the best thing is to show your maximum
love to everyone. In that love you should

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:47.910
not show your pity, but love which is, again,
alladhadayini. This is the message of Shri

01:02:49.029 --> 01:02:53.569
Krishna, but I don’t know how many understood
it. Now, what you find those who are following

01:02:53.569 --> 01:03:00.569
Shri Krishna like Hare Rama people, they are
really beggars on the street. He is Kubera,

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:08.599
and his disciples are all beggars, can you
imagine? Does it add to His glory as a Kubera?

01:03:08.599 --> 01:03:15.599
So, Sahaja Yogis are not like that. Should
be generous, should not bother too much about

01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:25.470
yourself. Should not all the time think about
yourself, but think of the collectivity, how

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:33.950
you behave. Collectivity is not to bring - force
people to come to Sahaja Yoga. Once they come

01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:43.700
to Sahaja Yoga they will know the joy of life
and you don’t have to tell them anything.

01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:50.700
Nothing has to be told, just silently it will
work and they will feel your love.

01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:58.380
You see, love is something so great. It not
only helps others but it also helps you. It’s

01:04:01.230 --> 01:04:07.430
so joyous to give realizations to others.
But if you start telling, “Your this chakra

01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:11.319
is catching”, why you are giving realization?
If you don’t know how to give realization,

01:04:11.319 --> 01:04:18.319
better not do it. So, to criticize is not
the way we can enjoy love. Ah, of course you

01:04:22.369 --> 01:04:29.049
can pull legs of each other sometimes, just
for fun’s sake, but not to harm, not to

01:04:29.049 --> 01:04:36.049
torture, not to make that person fall. You
are all sahaj dharmis, you have accepted sahaj

01:04:38.249 --> 01:04:45.249
dharma and in sahaj dharma we have to have
pure love of the heart, not hypocrisy - and

01:04:52.619 --> 01:04:53.720
sensible life.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:05:00.720
Now, this pope is against abortion. I’m
not. If a woman is suffering, let her have

01:05:02.059 --> 01:05:09.059
abortion. The one who is living is more important
than who are not living. If somebody wants

01:05:09.660 --> 01:05:16.660
to have abortion, that child can be born again.
According to us, nobody dies permanently.

01:05:18.089 --> 01:05:22.890
Whatever it may be.

01:05:22.890 --> 01:05:29.890
So, this is one way they use it for propagation
of human beings. Like they say the Muslim

01:05:33.499 --> 01:05:38.740
women are like a factory. They go on producing
more children, more children, more children.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:45.740
So there are more voters. So the pope knows
that. That’s why he says, abortion, no.

01:05:46.890 --> 01:05:53.890
Christians should not abort, because then
there will be less Christians to compete with

01:05:55.369 --> 01:05:57.589
the Muslims.

01:05:57.589 --> 01:06:02.769
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have such funny,
radical, nonsensical things. We have divorce,

01:06:02.769 --> 01:06:09.769
and we have also abortion, which is important
to understand that these are all taboos which

01:06:14.769 --> 01:06:21.769
are there. But not for people who have to
get out of the troubles - you have to have

01:06:24.999 --> 01:06:31.999
it. And that’s how it works. But to be very
frank, we don’t have to do abortions, it

01:06:32.849 --> 01:06:39.849
is achieved by Paramchaitanya. Paramchaitanya
does for Me. I don’t have to. I don’t

01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:49.069
have to do anything. It’s Paramchaitanya.
It’s nice, because it knows what is to be

01:06:49.069 --> 01:06:55.460
done, how to achieve it. And sometimes you
are in trouble, then know that you are not

01:06:55.460 --> 01:07:00.609
leaving things into the hands of the Paramchaitanya.
If you leave into the hands of Paramchaitanya

01:07:00.609 --> 01:07:06.450
things will work out very well.

01:07:06.450 --> 01:07:12.710
So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, first and foremost
thing is, how much you are enjoying yourself.

01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:19.710
How much enjoyment you are giving to others?
For that you have music, you have this, that.

01:07:21.039 --> 01:07:28.039
I was saying that today I won’t speak much,
but, somehow, with Shri Krishna
you can’t keep quiet. He played murli, basuri,

01:07:37.049 --> 01:07:44.049
flute. Look at Him. I talked to Him, but He
just played murli. He didn’t talk so much,

01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:53.559
except for the Gita, you won’t find Him
talking. And those who read also Gita are

01:07:53.559 --> 01:07:58.940
horrible people, I tell you, I have met - those
who read Gita. They don’t understand what

01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:03.680
is Shri Krishna’s dharma is. If they don’t
understand Shri Krishna, how will they understand

01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:10.680
Sahaja Yoga? So, for all of you is to practice
on love, on forgiveness, on appreciating others,

01:08:20.859 --> 01:08:24.359
on giving joy to others.

01:08:24.359 --> 01:08:30.529
Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very kind
to Me also. Once I went to the shop to buy

01:08:30.529 --> 01:08:37.529
a sari for Myself and the sari was very expensive
for My purpose. So, I didn’t buy. Said,

01:08:39.730 --> 01:08:46.730
“Let it be. This color suits Me, all right,
but doesn’t matter.” I didn’t have so

01:08:46.969 --> 01:08:53.969
much money to buy. So, that Sahaja Yogi bought
that sari and on My birthday gave Me - and

01:08:54.290 --> 01:08:56.210
really, I could not see it, because My eyes
were filled with tears. Just a small thing

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:56.460
like that. Normally I don’t expect you to
do anything for Me, no. But small, small things

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.650
make you so happy. But even if you do this
to somebody, may not understand, may not realize,

01:08:57.650 --> 01:09:03.690
may not feel it. But if you are a Sahaja Yogi,
you will.

01:09:03.690 --> 01:09:03.940
So thank you very much for all this that I
have said to you, try to enjoy yourself and

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.060
make others enjoy you.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.060
May God bless you!

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.060
Lecture after some music:

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.060
You can see I’ve become black today because
of Shri Krishna. It’s very interesting how

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.060
everything in this world moves according to
the desire of the Paramchaitanya. It’s very

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.060
surprising. I wanted them to make a film about
fundamentalism. It’s done very well. And

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.060
we might be able to show it in India – maybe,
because they have already asked Me to make

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:04.060
some episodes of My life, which they would
like to show, one after another. Somehow in

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.440
India in the television we have many Sahaja
Yogis, I didn’t know. Even the director,

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:05.690
deputy director, they were all Sahaja Yogis.
And once they came to see Me in Delhi in our

01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:05.730
ashram and said to Me - somebody said, “Mother,
You don’t like media, but what about television?”

01:09:05.730 --> 01:09:06.119
I said, “Don’t talk to Me about television.
They are horrible people there, ruining our

01:09:06.119 --> 01:09:07.049
lives,” and I gave a very big lecture, you
know, for about five minutes. So, two persons

01:09:07.049 --> 01:09:08.710
came before Me, holding their ears, they said,
“Mother, we’re sorry, but we belong to

01:09:08.710 --> 01:09:08.960
the television.”

01:09:08.750 --> 01:09:09.000
“I see, I’m sorry, if I’ve said something.”

01:09:08.940 --> 01:09:09.279
Then they said, “I’m the director and
he’s the deputy director of the All-India

01:09:09.279 --> 01:09:09.529
Institute of Television.” Can you imagine?

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:09.670
“Oh, My God,” I said, “I never knew
you were here and I’m sorry for what I’ve

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:09.670
said.”

01:09:09.420 --> 01:09:11.069
So they wanted to have My – I think I had
three interviews with them. They said, “Mother,

01:09:11.069 --> 01:09:12.150
we’ll not ask You a question.” All right.
“But then You come and sit wherever You

01:09:12.150 --> 01:09:12.600
want to sit and we’ll organize everything
and we want to show to the people what is

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:12.850
reality.”

01:09:12.609 --> 01:09:12.859
I was so surprised, you know, they did it,
no doubt. But last time when they wanted to

01:09:12.790 --> 01:09:14.029
do it I was not in Delhi and I couldn’t
do it. So I said, “Next time I’ll try

01:09:14.029 --> 01:09:14.279
to do something.”

01:09:14.109 --> 01:09:15.319
They said, “Why not You give some episodes
to us?” I think the films I’ve seen which

01:09:15.319 --> 01:09:16.600
these – the Americans, the great, have made
– all of them I would like to give them.

01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.790
But the second part of Christians also must
be shown, to give a balance. And also of the

01:09:17.790 --> 01:09:21.810
stupid Hindu – you call them – false gurus.
So like that we can have a combination of

01:09:21.810 --> 01:09:22.060
three films. In that you can show about Hare
Ramas, how they are begging, and how other

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:22.270
people are beggars - like Jehovah’s’ Witness.
But apart from that, Christianity works out

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:22.270
everything secretly, you see. So you have
to expose some things also there. Because

01:09:22.020 --> 01:09:22.739
it is, on top it’s very nice, very good
to talk to and all that, but inside they are

01:09:22.739 --> 01:09:23.400
doing all kinds of things, and making people
take to, what you can say, something very

01:09:23.400 --> 01:09:24.060
sinister. Something very wrong. Now they – unless
and until you expose all these three it won’t

01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:24.589
have a balance, I think, and then we can talk
about Sahaja Yoga as well.

01:09:24.589 --> 01:09:26.100
I’m very happy the way the film was made,
I’m very, very happy. That the Muslims are,

01:09:26.100 --> 01:09:26.350
poor things, from childhood are taught to
hate everyone. At least in Christianity they

01:09:26.219 --> 01:09:26.469
talk of love. Talk, talk – again I say.
Because they have had so many wars and so

01:09:26.359 --> 01:09:26.609
many nonsensical things. Now we can put forward
in these films, say for Christians we can

01:09:26.489 --> 01:09:26.739
put forward Gnostics. We can put forward in
the Muslim thing how the real person was Ali,

01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.880
how He was murdered, His wife, his children
were murdered and what’s going on now. It’s

01:09:26.770 --> 01:09:30.690
quite a bold theme which you have to put in.
And by doing all these things nobody gets

01:09:30.690 --> 01:09:30.940
anything – peace or joy, which is promised
by religion. So, these religions have no meaning.

01:09:30.750 --> 01:09:31.000
The religion within is very different, which
is to be awakened. And once it is awakened

01:09:30.810 --> 01:09:31.060
we all become one. We have to come to that
point. So, I think this film as it is - is

01:09:30.889 --> 01:09:31.139
all right, it could be little bit shortened
here and there, plus you must have another

01:09:30.949 --> 01:09:31.199
film and another film. Then these three films,
if they are ready, I’m sure, will be able

01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:31.270
to show the nonsense that is going on.

01:09:31.049 --> 01:09:31.299
The Muslims are against Christians more, also
against Jews. But Christians they are against,

01:09:31.109 --> 01:09:31.359
because they think this Christian religion
gives complete freedom to do what you like,

01:09:31.159 --> 01:09:31.409
their women go nude, they wear very scanty
dresses, and the women are like prostitutes

01:09:31.219 --> 01:09:31.469
and men are, I don’t know, they run after
women and men run after. So that’s the only

01:09:31.290 --> 01:09:31.540
job they’ve got. They haven’t got anything
higher, anything great. So they are against

01:09:31.339 --> 01:09:31.589
– they think that they must put some taboos.

01:09:31.469 --> 01:09:33.040
But I like the way you showed about these
people from Colombia – aboriginal. I’m

01:09:33.040 --> 01:09:33.290
going to talk about them in Ganesha Puja.
They are worth lots of things more than you

01:09:33.049 --> 01:09:33.299
know. So we have to see to this, that what
is wrong in all these things? In Sahaja Yoga

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:33.310
we attend to our primordial taboos. They’re
primordial. These taboos are primordial. And

01:09:33.060 --> 01:09:33.310
if you cross them and if you leave your maryadas,
then – whether you are a Muslim or a Hindu,

01:09:33.069 --> 01:09:33.319
you cannot be saved, you cannot get your realization.
So in Sahaja Yoga the built-in dharma within

01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:33.330
us is awakened and we take to primordial taboos
which are meant for a human being. If a human

01:09:33.089 --> 01:09:33.339
being does not observe these taboos, then
what happens: whatever is happening in America

01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:33.350
or Iran or any other country. So what are
the primordial taboos and all that I am going

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:33.359
to discuss in Ganesha Puja. And once that
is awakened within us I don’t tell you,

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:33.359
“Don’t do this and don’t do that,”
there’s no need, because it’s all awakened

01:09:33.119 --> 01:09:33.369
within you and you just don’t do it. So
that is has to be brought in this way.

01:09:33.130 --> 01:09:33.380
But the filming was very good, acting was
excellent, I must say, but we can write another

01:09:33.139 --> 01:09:33.389
story without Me, if you possible. Of course
this will be all right for Indians, they will

01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:33.400
understand. But if you show this to any Muslim
country, they’ll be shocked. For that I

01:09:33.150 --> 01:09:33.400
would say that this gentleman who was this
Rouhani – Ayatollah Rouhani – he sent

01:09:33.159 --> 01:09:33.409
a very nice letter, say that “In the Koran
it is written that to follow a religion you

01:09:33.170 --> 01:09:33.420
read about it. The main thing is you have
to know yourself. If you do not know yourself,

01:09:33.179 --> 01:09:33.429
you can never know God.” It’s written,
clearly. So he said, “This great work is

01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:33.440
done by Shri Mataji, is the work of Islam
that She is doing.” It’s a big, sort of,

01:09:33.190 --> 01:09:33.440
what you can call a big certificate because
he is head of all the Shias of Europe.

01:09:33.199 --> 01:09:33.449
So that is how, if we want to make people
happy we cannot discipline them, we cannot

01:09:33.210 --> 01:09:33.460
tell them, “Don’t do this, don’t do
that.” Only thing you better awaken them.

01:09:33.219 --> 01:09:33.469
As soon as there is light within you, you
see for yourself what’s wrong. Of course,

01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:33.480
some people do get it much faster, I must
say, much deeper. But some have ego, some

01:09:33.230 --> 01:09:33.480
have conditionings. So still they go back
to it and again come back to it, you see it’s

01:09:33.239 --> 01:09:33.489
like that. But mostly Sahaja Yogis, once they
get to Sahaja Yoga, they go deep into it – mostly.

01:09:33.250 --> 01:09:33.500
And I must say that we are now sending lots
of Russians to America, they will solve the

01:09:33.259 --> 01:09:33.509
problem.

01:09:33.259 --> 01:09:33.509
May God bless you!

01:09:33.259 --> 01:09:33.509
[Hindi ?]

01:09:33.259 --> 01:09:33.509
It’s not so easy, let it be. Another very
great miracle I must say, I was to go to Russia,

01:09:33.270 --> 01:09:33.520
but felt sick and I had to take rest, couldn’t
go to Russia. And the Russians had prepared

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:33.529
for the marriages, you see. So then they thought
we could have marriages in Cabella. I said,

01:09:33.290 --> 01:09:33.540
”That’s absurd, because we can have an
English marriage, but not possible to have

01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:33.549
an Indian marriage in Cabella. Will be very
difficult. But a thing happened, you see,

01:09:33.299 --> 01:09:33.549
to convince Me. I said, “The biggest problem
will be about saris for the brides.” Because

01:09:33.310 --> 01:09:33.560
nobody can select. I have to go and select,
and how will it happen? And suddenly somebody

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:33.569
told Me, “Mother, we have some very nice
saris.”

01:09:33.319 --> 01:09:33.569
“Very nice saris? Bring them along.” I
was amazed - there were seventy-two saris,

01:09:33.330 --> 01:09:33.580
very beautiful with very good zuri work, just
for the bride, in red color. Can you imagine?

01:09:33.339 --> 01:09:33.589
I said, “This is Shri Krishna, Who has sent
the saris, as He had supplied it at the time

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:33.600
when Draupadi asked for saris, you see. After
that I decided, “All right, what may come,

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:33.609
we must have the weddings.” So there might
be some, some maybe, I don’t know what will

01:09:33.359 --> 01:09:33.609
be, some handicaps, doesn’t matter, but
it’s a very big venture, I think, to marry

01:09:33.369 --> 01:09:33.619
you people here with American arrangements
and in Indian style in Italy.

01:09:33.380 --> 01:09:33.630
So all of you have to be very happy about
it and join in every way, and actually it

01:09:33.389 --> 01:09:33.639
has worked out so well that I am Myself surprised.
So, this Paramchaitanya is working, but this

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:33.650
time specially, supplying sari is the job
of Shri Krishna, you know, and He’s done

01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:33.650
His job very well. So I wish you all great
luck for enjoying these marriages. Now the

01:09:33.409 --> 01:09:33.659
time is little too much, but because of short
time we have something to do now is to announce

01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:33.670
the marriage we have thought was the best
for the people. Imagine, they said at the

01:09:33.429 --> 01:09:33.679
most seventy or eighty marriages, now they
are one hundred. Hundred and eight!

01:09:33.429 --> 01:09:33.679
Now so, people who are remarrying, we have
arranged something else for them, but who

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:33.690
are marrying for the first time. So if you
don’t mind I’ll ask somebody to read the

01:09:33.449 --> 01:09:33.699
names of the couples now, because we have
no time, you see. It’s such a fast running

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:33.710
train, you know.

01:09:33.460 --> 01:09:33.710
So Yogi, the great, is going to do that.
