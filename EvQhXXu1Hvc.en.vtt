Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Shrirampur Puja, India

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:34.800
December 12, 1990

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.620
Please be seated.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:48.370
[Marathi]

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:55.370
We have come to this place with the idea that
we'll be comfortable in the other place as

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.469
we were before, but you must have known that
there's a man who is quite devilish, and he

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:10.469
has tried to make this funny arrangement just
to extract some money from us for doing nothing.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:20.840
What I have to tell you, that we should remember
that when we are doing right in this Kruta

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:28.210
Yuga, this is the time when the Paramachaitanya
has become active. That's why it is called

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:40.760
as Kruta Yuga. At this time this power is
extremely active. They used to torture the

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.500
saints in this country and every country,
who were real people. And they used to also

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.490
make their lives impossible, because they
were lonely people - one saint here, one saint

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:13.480
there. But in these modern times we are so
many - we have so many Sahaja Yogis all over

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:26.090
the world. So first of all we are collectively
very strong, and secondly the Brahmachaitanya

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.849
Itself has become active. It's a very great
thing, we must realize it within ourselves,

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:41.409
that no amount of cruelty, planning against
us, any kind of violence of other people cannot

00:02:53.469 --> 00:03:00.469
harm us. If they ever try to harm us, they'll
be harmed themselves; apart from that, all

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:10.849
our work will go all smoothly. But we should
not lose even for a minute our self-confidence

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.739
and our determination. Above all we must have
faith in the Paramachaitanya, which is now

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:34.560
acting.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:41.560
All our complaints, all our problems are because
of ourselves. Because we lose faith in ourselves,

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:52.400
then all these horrible things happen. And
whatever may happen, even when people stoned

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.230
us it has helped us a lot. Of course some
people were hurt a little bit, doesn’t matter.

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:19.230
But the case has been filed, and this horrible
organization is under trouble. Nobody could

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:27.660
do anything to them. Only when we started
our own court case they have become quieter.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.860
How things work out for our help, one can
see it so clearly, and one should have full

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:51.699
faith in oneself to understand that God is
with us and He is all-powerful.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:10.520
So many examples you can give and so many
examples I can give, and I can tell you that

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:25.830
it is only our diffidence which makes problems
for us. Now supposing there was a snake. (Laughter)

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:41.199
There's nothing to be afraid of. No snake
can bite any Sahaja Yogi. They are more sensible

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:48.669
than these devilish people. When I was in
Gandhi Ashram we were supposed to get up at

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:57.139
four o'clock. Gandhiji was a great disciplinarian.
He was not like Me. So everybody had to take

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:04.159
bath, and by five o'clock we had to go to
the Pratna. And in the Pratna place, even

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:12.110
reaching there we could see so many snakes
crawling around, and we were supposed to just

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.629
go to the Pratna place without complaining.
And sometimes you would find a snake just

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:23.610
sitting before you like this, and you were
supposed to keep quiet and do the Pratna.

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.939
But nobody was beaten up. All these years
I was there, used to visit that place, I must

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:35.270
have seen so many snakes; otherwise I have
never seen otherwise snakes much in life.

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:39.520
But that's the only time I have seen snakes
sitting just like this before some of the

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:46.520
meditators, and trying to enjoy their meditation.
(Laughter)

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:58.740
Snakes understand vibrations - they love coolness.
Once I had gone to a village and My husband

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:06.560
had gone a little ahead; was sitting on a
bridge - there were some steps there - sitting

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:13.560
like this; and a big python like that started
moving under My foot, under My legs. I saw

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:20.030
it moving, such a thick one like this. It
moved. It didn't do anything to Me, I know

00:07:20.030 --> 00:07:24.879
it cannot, because it likes the coolness and
it was enjoying very nicely moving. (Laughter)

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:30.150
It took about one-and-a-half minutes.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:35.370
So first of all we have to realize that we
are Sahaja Yogis, specially blessed people,

00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:42.199
that we have got Realization, which very few
people have got in this world. And secondly

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:49.199
that all the animals understand us. They understand
us better than human beings, because they

00:07:54.590 --> 00:08:01.590
are under the control of God Almighty. I'm
never afraid of a tiger, never afraid of any

00:08:04.699 --> 00:08:11.699
lions, nothing. I'm never afraid. But if I
see a madman or a drunkard - specially a drunkard,

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:20.080
I'm not afraid but I get repulsed, because
I think this man has such bad vibrations.

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:27.080
Because animals never drink. Even a mad dog
is better than a madman. So we have to understand

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:37.570
that we are not under the control of God that
much, because God has given us freedom. But

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:44.570
now we are not only under the control of this
Paramachaitanya, but the Paramachaitanya looks

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:52.370
after us every minute. And that's how things
work out. There’re so many instances of

00:08:57.139 --> 00:09:03.350
this kind of thing. But if your faith is wavering,
if you are frightened, then you have to little

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:09.740
bit understand that you are not to be frightened.
Things have worked out - so many people can

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:16.000
tell you so many things. Swiss people were
to come for a Puja in Poona. I knew they were

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000
to come. They never informed us, but I knew.
And I was postponing the Puja as much as I

00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:31.190
could. These people took a taxi from Bombay
and they came up to Poona, and they wanted

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:41.190
to go to Pratishthana. This they knew, the
taxi fellow knew. Instead of going to Pratishthan

00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:48.190
he took them to another place, Bhugaon, where
we all were camping. And these people saw,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.670
so they just got down. He said, "No, no, this
is not Pratishthan." He said, "This is the

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:59.200
place we had to come." And they were just
right in time there.

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:06.200
I mean, you can all write so many things,
how God has helped you in every way possible:

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:18.279
monetarily, as protection, as blessings from
all sides. So to solve the problem, we don't

00:10:21.329 --> 00:10:28.329
have to worry. Actually we should have no
problems at all. Some people start thinking

00:10:32.019 --> 00:10:39.019
that by logical deductions they can find out
things. They cannot, because you are at a

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:46.310
level that logic doesn't work. You are at
a level where Brahmachaitanya works, and It

00:10:47.070 --> 00:10:54.070
has Its own logic. So do not try to resolve
anything by logic. First thing your connection

00:10:54.850 --> 00:11:01.180
with the Spirit will be lost, your connection
with the joy will be lost, your connection

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:08.180
with the vibrations will be lost. So there
is no logical conclusion, but the Divine logic

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:18.190
takes over. That doesn't mean that you are
a slave, but on the contrary you are the great

00:11:22.260 --> 00:11:29.260
guest in the Kingdom of God. There's a difference
between the two attitudes. Supposing I come

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:38.540
here, so they want that they should garland
Me. I can say, "I'm not your slave, why should

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:46.730
you garland Me?" They may say, "We'd like
You to come for a procession." I may say,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:52.839
"I cannot come, I'm sorry. I'm free. I will
do what I like. How can you decide for Me?"

00:11:52.839 --> 00:11:59.839
But I am their guest and they are inviting
Me to honor, to look after Me, for protection.

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:09.230
If something you people try to do for My protection,
should I say that it is slavery? Of course

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:18.759
you know that I don't need any protection,
but still you try to protect Me. It's all

00:12:18.759 --> 00:12:25.759
right, I don't mind, because if that gives
you pleasure I don't mind, and I don't feel

00:12:26.730 --> 00:12:33.730
that way about it, as if I have become now
a slave of all the Sahaja Yogis. You fix Me

00:12:34.029 --> 00:12:40.889
up and I am moving like a shuttlecock all
the time. I never grudge, never grumble. All

00:12:40.889 --> 00:12:45.880
right, I accept it, whatever you say. You
are not doing to harm Me in any way, or to

00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:52.880
be disrespectful, but you are trying to help
Me out in a way that I should be able to achieve

00:12:54.029 --> 00:13:01.029
greater capacity to work, and a greater facility.
How can I not understand that?

00:13:04.209 --> 00:13:11.209
So you have to have that kind of an intelligence
to feel the existence of that All-pervading

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:18.480
Power all round us. You have seen so many
photographs. You have seen on top of your

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:26.990
heads there is Light. Though mentally you
accept, but in the heart you do not. Those

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:34.240
people accept in the heart, I know them, and
those who do not accept, I know them. Those

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:43.860
who accept Me never allow Me to say, "Why
didn't you do this?" Whatever I say they will

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:52.750
do, because now they have accepted Me from
their heart.

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:59.750
Like yesterday it was a simple thing: I bought
these caps for you. So many didn't buy, I

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:05.880
was surprised. I went all the way to buy,
to protect your heads. Why didn't you buy

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:12.190
them? They're worth nothing: three, four rupees
is what? - nothing. Or the dhotis I bought

00:14:12.190 --> 00:14:17.410
for you. All the way - I don't mind if you
don't want to buy, but it's surprising they

00:14:17.410 --> 00:14:24.410
didn't buy. You could have worn them today
and you would have looked very nice. Of course

00:14:25.500 --> 00:14:32.500
you have freedom. It's worth nothing - but
it shows how far you are there. Mother has

00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.120
bought it, with such love She has selected
for us, it's worth nothing. I could have given

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:46.120
you them as presents also, but I just wanted
to test. And this is how the testing comes.

00:14:49.680 --> 00:14:55.050
After all there's no harm in wearing a cap
in this heat; it's better to wear the cap.

00:14:55.050 --> 00:14:59.490
And also to have a dhoti is better because
that's the dress of this country, and whatever

00:14:59.490 --> 00:15:04.829
is the dress of the country, that is more
suitable for this country. It's very hot here

00:15:04.829 --> 00:15:10.699
and the dhoti, which is a cotton dhoti or
a, even a silk dhoti, is a beautiful thing

00:15:10.699 --> 00:15:17.699
to wear. I don't want to force anything on
you, but it is you who are judged also, that

00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:27.040
such a small thing like a cap... Now how many
of you did not buy the cap? Raise your hands.

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:41.600
All right. So give them presents! (Laughter)
And how many of you didn't buy the dhotis?

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:56.899
Should I give you presents? Please buy.

00:15:56.899 --> 00:15:57.670
Yogi: [ ? ]

00:15:57.670 --> 00:16:04.670
Shri Mataji: It’s finished - all right,
so I'll get you more. But they are very comfortable

00:16:07.259 --> 00:16:14.259
and beautiful, very nice, so beautiful. You'll
enjoy them.

00:16:16.540 --> 00:16:23.540
All right. So small, small things can express
our attention - very small things. Like such

00:16:33.610 --> 00:16:40.610
a great sky is there, and when you look at
it every leaf, supposing there is a tree,

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:49.750
every leaf can be seen against that sky. In
the same way Sahaja Yoga is such a great thing.

00:16:54.879 --> 00:17:01.879
But it shows every small curves, and every
delicate behavior. Of course there's no challenge,

00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:15.620
no personality insult or in any way. But the
more you understand Sahaja Yoga, the deeper

00:17:19.230 --> 00:17:26.230
you go into it, you will know that everything,
whatever is done in Sahaja Yoga is for your

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:35.339
benevolence. Nothing else, it's for your benevolence.
And that this power is so well-equipped with

00:17:42.890 --> 00:17:49.890
everything. And you must have full faith in
yourself and in this power, that whatever

00:17:54.520 --> 00:18:01.520
you do and whatever you want, or whatever
is your forward movement - everything is looked

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:15.309
after, guided, organized, arranged for you
beforehand. Thus you'll be surprised how you

00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:27.539
are looked after.

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:33.860
Now specially for ladies, their one of the
assets of ladies is to be frightened and another

00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:40.860
is to cry. So, of course I too cry sometimes,
but never at My own discomfiture. Never at

00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:59.380
My own pain, only when others are pained then
My eyes, being collective, start just pouring

00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:11.980
uncontrolled tears. But for Myself I never
cry. For My pain, even if I want to I cannot.

00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:24.650
I cannot. Just My body cannot.

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:31.650
The second thing you must know: I am also
a woman; I am never afraid of anything whatsoever.

00:19:36.630 --> 00:19:43.539
Of course animals I have already told you.
Except for the drunkard - (Shri Mataji laughing)

00:19:43.539 --> 00:19:49.190
you don't know how he'll behave, because not
easy, not senses. I'm not afraid of anything

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:56.190
whatsoever. In the same way you have to know
that your Mother is with you and you should

00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:05.520
have no fear at all, and then to boast of
your fear is nonsensical. Once you realize

00:20:13.039 --> 00:20:20.039
how powerful you are, and how much you are
connected to that power which is so powerful

00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:28.110
and all-pervading, which does all the living
work, you will never get anyone of these funny

00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:37.020
ideas which are to be left behind. You have
to cross the threshold of these conditionings

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:50.240
that you have had. Just open your heart and
see for yourself - where are you sitting,

00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:42.580
where have
you reached, under what blessings you are
here.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:38.150
May God

00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:52.100
bless you!

00:34:59.040 --> 00:35:06.040
[Marathi]
