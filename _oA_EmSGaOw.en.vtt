02:57.566 --> 03:03.566
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

03:04.192 --> 03:08.192
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

03:10.775 --> 03:14.150
For example, today is Wednesday

03:14.566 --> 03:17.566
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

03:18.566 --> 03:21.108
because I was born on Wednesday.

03:21.941 --> 03:25.941
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

03:26.025 --> 03:28.025
we’ll be able to manage it

03:28.067 --> 03:30.067
because I was born at twelve.

03:30.566 --> 03:33.566
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

03:33.983 --> 03:38.983
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

03:39.025 --> 03:41.566
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

03:41.566 --> 03:44.775
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

03:45.025 --> 03:50.733
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

03:50.858 --> 03:52.983
that you all are ready for a Puja

03:53.025 --> 03:58.691
and that we could break this rule also,

03:58.733 --> 04:02.067
after such a long time,

04:02.067 --> 04:08.566
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

04:08.566 --> 04:10.150
I was trying, trying, trying

04:10.192 --> 04:13.608
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

04:19.566 --> 04:24.566
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

04:25.566 --> 04:30.983
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

04:32.900 --> 04:37.900
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

04:39.566 --> 04:41.566
and I don’t know how far

04:41.566 --> 04:45.566
I can go with the description of this great country

04:45.941 --> 04:48.941
which we call as Greece.

04:50.566 --> 04:59.108
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

04:59.566 --> 05:04.941
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

05:05.566 --> 05:08.025
and a “dweep” is a island.

05:08.025 --> 05:12.983
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

05:13.150 --> 05:18.025
and there is a temple of Athena,

05:18.566 --> 05:24.900
all been described about Her temple, about Her

05:27.816 --> 05:30.816
jewelry, dress and everything.

05:31.649 --> 05:35.649
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

05:35.816 --> 05:39.816
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

05:40.733 --> 05:44.025
So now, one may say that,

05:44.025 --> 05:46.275
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

05:46.566 --> 05:49.566
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

05:50.150 --> 05:52.566
One may ask a question like that,

05:52.566 --> 05:59.566
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

06:00.566 --> 06:06.566
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

06:08.983 --> 06:13.983
before the Creation was created in the material form,

06:14.941 --> 06:17.941
where it was planned,

06:20.566 --> 06:24.150
then there was something of the –

06:24.566 --> 06:26.566
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

06:28.566 --> 06:36.067
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

06:37.608 --> 06:42.983
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

06:43.566 --> 06:52.649
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

06:53.233 --> 06:58.900
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

06:58.941 --> 07:01.941
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

07:01.941 --> 07:04.233
and create vibrations there.

07:04.983 --> 07:09.233
Now in the material form the Gokul was

07:09.233 --> 07:12.858
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

07:14.900 --> 07:21.775
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

07:22.733 --> 07:28.608
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

07:28.858 --> 07:33.275
in this area, to create the vibrations.

07:33.733 --> 07:36.192
So it is not only She was a Goddess

07:36.858 --> 07:39.150
but She lived in this area

07:39.566 --> 07:42.566
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

07:43.150 --> 07:50.150
to create the universal

07:51.108 --> 07:56.108
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

07:56.150 --> 08:03.150
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

08:05.025 --> 08:12.025
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

08:13.566 --> 08:16.566
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

08:17.566 --> 08:22.192
and the Mahalakshmi has got

08:22.566 --> 08:25.566
for the redemption, for the awakening.

08:26.150 --> 08:30.816
But the Adi Shakti’s work

08:30.816 --> 08:33.816
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

08:36.108 --> 08:39.275
and to integrate all those qualities,

08:39.566 --> 08:44.566
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

08:44.566 --> 08:49.192
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

08:49.775 --> 08:52.775
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.566
But as it is,

08:56.608 --> 08:58.816
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

08:58.816 --> 09:01.816
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

09:01.858 --> 09:04.858
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

09:06.566 --> 09:07.900
And this is the…

09:07.941 --> 09:10.150
where She created the Devaloka.

09:11.192 --> 09:15.566
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

09:15.983 --> 09:18.566
Like She created Indra –

09:18.816 --> 09:21.941
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

09:21.941 --> 09:26.941
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

09:27.566 --> 09:30.566
Devaloka was created on this side,

09:31.983 --> 09:35.775
and ganas and all these people were created

09:35.775 --> 09:40.233
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

09:46.566 --> 09:50.566
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

09:50.900 --> 09:56.983
in such a condition when people were really,

09:57.025 --> 10:00.816
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

10:00.816 --> 10:02.816
they could not understand Him,

10:02.858 --> 10:05.858
they could not understand Socrates at all

10:05.858 --> 10:11.025
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

10:11.025 --> 10:15.025
by the people who were surrounding Him,

10:15.816 --> 10:19.816
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

10:19.816 --> 10:23.067
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

10:23.067 --> 10:27.566
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

10:27.775 --> 10:33.150
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

10:33.566 --> 10:36.566
and they started their own theories, own styles,

10:36.566 --> 10:39.566
and that’s how we find the accent from

10:39.566 --> 10:43.566
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

10:43.983 --> 10:48.900
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

10:48.900 --> 10:52.900
So the attention was moved from philosophy

10:52.941 --> 10:55.941
to economics today,

10:55.941 --> 11:01.192
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

11:01.233 --> 11:05.941
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

11:05.983 --> 11:13.816
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

11:13.858 --> 11:19.858
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

11:21.941 --> 11:25.900
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

11:25.941 --> 11:27.566
Abraham had different problems.

11:27.566 --> 11:32.649
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

11:32.649 --> 11:35.150
who were  really very, very ignorant,

11:35.566 --> 11:39.983
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

11:40.566 --> 11:44.775
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

11:44.816 --> 11:46.566
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

11:46.566 --> 11:49.275
and if you read Bible, in the –

11:49.566 --> 11:53.983
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

11:54.192 --> 12:01.983
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

12:02.067 --> 12:06.733
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

12:06.858 --> 12:10.858
to make the people follow religion precisely.

12:11.566 --> 12:15.192
So He did not argue, He did not say

12:15.608 --> 12:18.941
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

12:19.067 --> 12:22.067
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

12:22.108 --> 12:25.691
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

12:25.983 --> 12:32.233
that you understand this or

12:32.816 --> 12:35.192
that you see the point;

12:35.566 --> 12:36.983
He could not do that way.

12:37.566 --> 12:41.192
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

12:41.566 --> 12:44.775
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

12:44.775 --> 12:47.775
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

12:48.983 --> 12:51.983
Because the people were of that type.

12:52.816 --> 12:55.649
Now then you see how gradually,

12:55.691 --> 12:59.649
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

12:59.733 --> 13:01.733
they were a much better people

13:01.858 --> 13:05.858
so He could talk to them about something

13:07.816 --> 13:12.816
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

13:12.816 --> 13:14.816
Of so many things He talked,

13:14.816 --> 13:17.983
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

13:19.566 --> 13:22.566
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

13:22.566 --> 13:24.566
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

13:26.192 --> 13:30.192
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

13:31.150 --> 13:35.150
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

13:35.566 --> 13:39.941
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

13:40.566 --> 13:44.108
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

13:44.608 --> 13:49.233
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

13:49.608 --> 13:53.691
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

13:53.733 --> 13:56.192
and the relationships were building up,

13:56.566 --> 13:59.733
and He tried to work it on that level.

13:59.858 --> 14:04.858
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

14:05.775 --> 14:09.566
They evolved but still very ignorant.

14:09.816 --> 14:12.025
So they evolved to this point

14:12.108 --> 14:15.941
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

14:15.983 --> 14:21.150
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

14:21.566 --> 14:24.900
taking their freedom, getting out from there

14:24.900 --> 14:32.566
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

14:34.108 --> 14:36.108
But when they did that,

14:36.150 --> 14:39.150
He found these people on the way –

14:39.150 --> 14:42.900
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

14:42.941 --> 14:45.941
when He came back – what He finds…

15:09.733 --> 15:14.192
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

15:14.691 --> 15:19.900
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

15:20.566 --> 15:24.983
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

15:24.983 --> 15:27.983
extremely immoral character.

15:28.025 --> 15:33.566
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

15:33.566 --> 15:36.900
that nobody can believe that anybody

15:36.900 --> 15:39.733
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

15:39.775 --> 15:41.941
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

15:42.900 --> 15:48.192
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

15:48.775 --> 15:56.775
Now then came the time when people were…

15:58.858 --> 16:03.566
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

16:03.691 --> 16:05.691
we can say at the time of Christ,

16:06.566 --> 16:09.025
but they were not so immoral;

16:09.733 --> 16:12.192
they also could not understand Christ.

16:12.983 --> 16:17.983
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

16:17.983 --> 16:20.566
the human awareness evolving,

16:20.691 --> 16:26.775
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

16:27.233 --> 16:30.233
and you could not talk to them.

16:32.566 --> 16:35.983
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

16:36.566 --> 16:39.192
When the circumstances are such,

16:39.900 --> 16:43.566
like at the time of, say Moses,

16:44.108 --> 16:47.108
that people are extremely immoral,

16:47.108 --> 16:50.108
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

16:51.566 --> 16:56.025
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

16:57.691 --> 17:02.691
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

17:03.566 --> 17:06.566
because they were so left-sided:

17:06.816 --> 17:10.775
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

17:10.775 --> 17:14.566
and say that, “If you do like this,

17:14.566 --> 17:17.566
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

17:17.941 --> 17:19.941
So they took to violence.

17:21.566 --> 17:27.566
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

17:28.608 --> 17:32.608
also the awareness of human beings.

17:32.733 --> 17:35.733
So many things worked it out.

17:36.691 --> 17:40.691
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

17:41.025 --> 17:49.733
her job was to create a integrated force

17:53.067 --> 18:00.816
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

18:01.150 --> 18:09.150
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

18:10.608 --> 18:17.608
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

18:21.858 --> 18:24.858
You have to integrate people

18:26.691 --> 18:29.691
which are left-sided and right-sided.

18:31.858 --> 18:35.566
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

18:35.608 --> 18:38.566
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

18:38.566 --> 18:41.691
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

18:43.566 --> 18:50.566
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

18:51.608 --> 18:57.858
and despite that they resisted him

18:57.858 --> 19:00.858
because they were given this special capacity.

19:02.067 --> 19:05.067
Something with Greeks, they went to…

19:05.067 --> 19:08.067
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

19:08.941 --> 19:13.900
who tried to invade India,

19:14.733 --> 19:17.775
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

19:18.941 --> 19:21.233
You see it’s a Greek nature

19:21.691 --> 19:24.941
that they can go so far and then not,

19:25.941 --> 19:28.941
because they have an integrating force.

19:29.233 --> 19:33.192
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

19:33.983 --> 19:38.733
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

19:39.566 --> 19:43.025
So this power of receding back

19:43.858 --> 19:47.566
is the integrating power,

19:48.566 --> 19:50.691
by you integrate within yourself

19:50.691 --> 19:55.691
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

19:55.733 --> 19:58.067
and you see now that’s alright.

19:59.067 --> 20:01.067
If you have to be in the centre

20:01.108 --> 20:04.108
we should go up to a point and come back.

20:05.025 --> 20:09.983
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

20:10.566 --> 20:12.566
If you take their shipping,

20:12.733 --> 20:16.067
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

20:16.150 --> 20:18.275
extremely aggressive people,

20:18.566 --> 20:22.275
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

20:22.566 --> 20:24.566
They were not very law-abiding

20:24.566 --> 20:27.150
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

20:27.192 --> 20:32.025
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

20:32.067 --> 20:37.691
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

20:37.691 --> 20:42.733
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

20:44.067 --> 20:48.067
So perhaps, perhaps,

20:48.566 --> 20:52.067
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

20:52.275 --> 20:55.275
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

20:56.067 --> 20:59.649
Then when the shipping went down –

20:59.691 --> 21:03.150
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

21:03.566 --> 21:05.566
they sunk their ships

21:07.067 --> 21:11.067
and got the money out of insurance.

21:16.566 --> 21:21.566
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

21:21.649 --> 21:26.816
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

21:27.108 --> 21:29.608
they know that how far to go.

21:29.775 --> 21:33.233
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

21:33.858 --> 21:36.691
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

21:36.691 --> 21:40.733
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

21:40.733 --> 21:44.192
Alright. He married her up to a point,

21:44.566 --> 21:47.649
but most of his property went to his daughter,

21:47.649 --> 21:49.649
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

21:50.900 --> 21:57.150
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

21:57.150 --> 22:00.858
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

22:00.900 --> 22:02.775
like Americans are.

22:02.816 --> 22:05.983
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

22:06.108 --> 22:08.108
but Greeks can never become idiots,

22:08.150 --> 22:10.150
whatever you may try.

22:11.566 --> 22:14.192
They are very sharp and very intelligent

22:15.067 --> 22:18.067
but they know how far to go with everything.

22:19.108 --> 22:22.108
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

22:23.150 --> 22:27.025
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

22:27.025 --> 22:30.025
and She created Ganesha here.

22:30.858 --> 22:34.150
And the balance of the universe,

22:34.150 --> 22:37.983
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

22:38.025 --> 22:42.608
and so the people over here are very balanced.

22:43.900 --> 22:48.775
You can find them very…

22:48.900 --> 22:53.775
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

22:54.067 --> 22:57.067
One may say because they are traditional people,

22:57.108 --> 22:59.108
they have long traditions.

22:59.566 --> 23:02.566
But Egypt had also long traditions.

23:03.192 --> 23:06.067
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

23:06.108 --> 23:09.983
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

23:10.233 --> 23:15.233
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

23:16.816 --> 23:19.816
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

23:20.566 --> 23:26.566
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

23:27.566 --> 23:29.900
but they are not like Indians.

23:31.858 --> 23:35.858
So what is lacking in all these people is

23:36.858 --> 23:40.858
the depth of awareness

23:41.775 --> 23:47.941
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

23:48.233 --> 23:55.192
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

23:56.192 --> 24:01.941
and China rose also, afterwards,

24:02.067 --> 24:05.067
into her own glory

24:05.608 --> 24:11.108
and became quite a good industrial,

24:11.566 --> 24:14.983
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

24:16.233 --> 24:21.858
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

24:21.858 --> 24:24.608
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

24:25.108 --> 24:26.900
Do you know last…

24:26.900 --> 24:29.858
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

24:29.858 --> 24:33.816
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

24:33.858 --> 24:36.649
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

24:36.649 --> 24:43.649
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

24:44.566 --> 24:47.108
and you see what’s happening in China.

24:48.983 --> 24:51.983
So the effects of these

24:56.566 --> 25:01.150
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

25:01.858 --> 25:05.858
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

25:06.775 --> 25:08.733
Now you may say that,

25:08.775 --> 25:12.775
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

25:14.067 --> 25:19.608
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

25:19.858 --> 25:23.025
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

25:23.150 --> 25:26.775
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

25:26.816 --> 25:29.941
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

25:29.941 --> 25:34.900
so I thought that let Greeks

25:36.025 --> 25:39.733
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

25:40.816 --> 25:44.192
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

25:44.566 --> 25:50.608
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

25:51.983 --> 25:57.775
because actually, at the time

25:57.816 --> 25:59.983
when Athena came here,

26:00.025 --> 26:04.150
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

26:04.900 --> 26:10.150
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

26:10.608 --> 26:13.192
So now to bring Himalaya here,

26:13.691 --> 26:18.566
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

26:19.858 --> 26:22.192
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

26:22.858 --> 26:26.150
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

26:26.649 --> 26:33.566
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

26:33.566 --> 26:35.775
most unorthodox,

26:36.900 --> 26:40.233
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

26:42.858 --> 26:47.566
So we have a problem, big problem,

26:48.150 --> 26:51.150
how we’ll establish here.

26:53.566 --> 26:57.816
The Devaloka was formed here

26:57.983 --> 27:01.983
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

27:02.566 --> 27:06.983
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

27:07.983 --> 27:12.983
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

27:12.983 --> 27:20.067
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

27:20.566 --> 27:27.733
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

27:28.900 --> 27:34.900
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

27:37.566 --> 27:40.816
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

27:41.067 --> 27:44.067
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

27:44.108 --> 27:48.108
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

27:49.108 --> 27:52.649
And that is responsible for the downfall

27:52.691 --> 27:56.733
because this part of the country

27:58.900 --> 28:03.900
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

28:05.150 --> 28:12.067
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

28:12.733 --> 28:18.775
we see it has become just the opposite

28:19.816 --> 28:26.941
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

28:26.983 --> 28:29.941
to such degrading things.

28:30.691 --> 28:37.025
Even in the mythology also, in India

28:37.608 --> 28:43.108
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

28:44.025 --> 28:49.775
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

28:50.566 --> 28:58.691
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

28:59.983 --> 29:06.941
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

29:07.067 --> 29:12.608
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

29:12.608 --> 29:17.900
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

29:18.025 --> 29:23.067
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

29:23.566 --> 29:28.025
and from here Indra went down

29:29.067 --> 29:32.067
and took away the wife.

29:33.067 --> 29:37.067
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

29:38.108 --> 29:41.025
and Indra went down,

29:41.067 --> 29:45.067
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

29:45.067 --> 29:49.067
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

29:50.566 --> 29:53.983
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

29:55.150 --> 29:58.691
So now the… see how the combinations are,

29:58.733 --> 30:06.067
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

30:06.067 --> 30:09.067
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

30:10.108 --> 30:13.608
it was in his ashram He stayed.

30:15.067 --> 30:18.275
So the Muni Shandilya told

30:19.025 --> 30:22.566
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

30:22.566 --> 30:28.067
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

30:28.608 --> 30:35.608
who will, by his own devotion,

30:36.067 --> 30:40.067
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

30:40.691 --> 30:47.192
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

30:48.649 --> 30:51.150
and He will kill this asura.

30:51.649 --> 30:56.649
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

30:56.649 --> 31:00.649
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

31:02.108 --> 31:04.192
So this Narasimha came

31:04.233 --> 31:10.067
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

31:10.941 --> 31:13.941
little boy played there around and he made some

31:14.025 --> 31:19.025
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

31:19.233 --> 31:24.150
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

31:24.566 --> 31:26.608
That was made by Prahlad,

31:26.733 --> 31:30.108
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

31:30.275 --> 31:33.608
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

31:33.816 --> 31:37.566
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

31:37.900 --> 31:40.775
So see the relationship, how it is.

31:41.108 --> 31:46.025
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

31:46.649 --> 31:54.067
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

31:54.775 --> 32:01.733
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

32:02.150 --> 32:08.192
that not any animal can kill him,

32:08.192 --> 32:10.900
not any human being can kill him,

32:10.900 --> 32:14.900
not on the land or in the sky,

32:15.649 --> 32:18.566
and not with any weapon –

32:18.566 --> 32:21.566
all so many blessings he had taken!

32:21.566 --> 32:24.275
He had closed all the lines, you see,

32:24.566 --> 32:26.649
so that nobody should kill him,

32:27.566 --> 32:33.108
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

32:34.192 --> 32:38.233
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

32:38.233 --> 32:42.233
is that He became the simha,

32:42.733 --> 32:47.816
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

32:48.983 --> 32:54.233
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

32:54.649 --> 32:57.775
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

32:57.775 --> 33:01.775
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

33:02.566 --> 33:04.900
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

33:05.108 --> 33:08.691
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

33:08.816 --> 33:11.983
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

33:11.983 --> 33:13.983
pillar of stone,

33:14.150 --> 33:18.150
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

33:18.566 --> 33:24.025
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

33:24.691 --> 33:27.025
with long hands and claws,

33:27.150 --> 33:29.816
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

33:29.983 --> 33:35.233
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

33:35.816 --> 33:40.566
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

33:40.816 --> 33:42.941
He opened his stomach and killed him.

33:45.067 --> 33:48.067
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

33:48.067 --> 33:52.733
the people of Egypt made their…

33:52.775 --> 33:56.150
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

33:57.150 --> 34:00.150
they were the ones who were asuras,

34:00.816 --> 34:02.816
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

34:03.566 --> 34:09.566
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

34:09.983 --> 34:13.233
the other way round than Narasimha.

34:15.941 --> 34:21.192
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

34:21.233 --> 34:28.233
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

34:29.816 --> 34:32.858
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

34:35.108 --> 34:40.983
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

34:41.025 --> 34:44.025
because all these devas were Greeks –

34:44.775 --> 34:47.733
and these devas were, like Indra,

34:47.733 --> 34:50.733
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

34:51.983 --> 34:54.900
But I think there… because

34:54.941 --> 34:58.775
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

34:59.192 --> 35:05.192
they could not see the proper image of their...

35:06.775 --> 35:12.192
of their...faces in their meditation

35:12.733 --> 35:14.608
because they perverted them

35:14.608 --> 35:17.608
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

35:17.608 --> 35:21.775
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

35:21.775 --> 35:24.566
which was all their own imagination

35:24.566 --> 35:28.691
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

35:28.733 --> 35:34.775
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

35:35.608 --> 35:42.150
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

35:42.608 --> 35:44.816
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

35:44.858 --> 35:48.150
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

35:48.192 --> 35:53.233
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

35:53.233 --> 35:57.233
So they made them more like…

35:58.649 --> 36:01.941
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

36:01.983 --> 36:04.858
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

36:04.858 --> 36:08.067
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

36:08.108 --> 36:10.566
like Varuna, I can tell you.

36:10.566 --> 36:13.733
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

36:13.733 --> 36:16.233
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

36:16.233 --> 36:21.733
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

36:22.566 --> 36:24.775
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

36:24.775 --> 36:27.900
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

36:28.816 --> 36:33.775
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

36:37.566 --> 36:40.608
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

36:40.608 --> 36:43.192
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

36:43.566 --> 36:44.900
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

36:44.900 --> 36:48.691
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

36:50.566 --> 36:52.816
So with such expense they gave it

36:52.858 --> 36:56.691
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

36:57.775 --> 37:00.691
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

37:00.691 --> 37:07.275
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

37:07.900 --> 37:15.775
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

37:16.025 --> 37:20.275
On that history stands the modern Greek.

37:21.608 --> 37:27.067
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

37:27.566 --> 37:29.941
people had evolved we think,

37:30.566 --> 37:33.566
but they also crucified Christ,

37:34.649 --> 37:36.649
so what was their evolution?

37:36.816 --> 37:43.691
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

37:44.025 --> 37:49.025
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

37:50.566 --> 37:52.150
there is much difference

37:52.941 --> 37:57.941
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

37:58.858 --> 38:02.775
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

38:02.775 --> 38:05.900
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

38:06.025 --> 38:09.983
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

38:10.150 --> 38:13.566
But still He was also killed;

38:14.025 --> 38:17.941
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

38:18.192 --> 38:22.608
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

38:22.816 --> 38:26.816
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

38:27.775 --> 38:33.067
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

38:33.649 --> 38:37.192
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

38:37.649 --> 38:43.649
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

38:43.733 --> 38:48.067
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

38:48.566 --> 38:49.691
500 before Christ;

38:49.983 --> 38:55.900
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

38:56.025 --> 38:59.733
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

39:00.067 --> 39:03.025
as because He was Primordial Master.

39:03.900 --> 39:07.900
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

39:09.649 --> 39:13.067
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

39:13.566 --> 39:18.275
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

39:19.150 --> 39:23.067
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

39:23.067 --> 39:27.025
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

39:27.691 --> 39:31.941
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

39:31.941 --> 39:35.941
they would not accept any person,

39:35.941 --> 39:38.858
they would throw away, they would beat people.

39:38.900 --> 39:43.025
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

39:43.067 --> 39:45.775
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

39:45.775 --> 39:47.691
like very harsh people.

39:48.566 --> 39:52.233
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

39:52.233 --> 39:55.566
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

39:55.566 --> 39:58.858
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

39:59.108 --> 40:01.150
See, He saw the point

40:01.816 --> 40:05.192
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

40:05.733 --> 40:07.608
talking in that way.

40:07.608 --> 40:10.775
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

40:10.775 --> 40:13.108
even reason it out like Socrates did,

40:13.566 --> 40:16.900
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

40:17.067 --> 40:20.025
the whole logic system comes from Him,

40:20.858 --> 40:22.858
He’s a master of logic.

40:22.858 --> 40:28.566
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

40:29.067 --> 40:32.733
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

40:32.858 --> 40:37.233
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

40:37.858 --> 40:41.566
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

40:41.733 --> 40:44.983
And Christ understood that there is no logic

40:45.192 --> 40:48.192
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

40:48.900 --> 40:51.608
So He talked to them in parables,

40:52.566 --> 40:54.233
but still they killed Him.

40:55.192 --> 41:00.025
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

41:00.025 --> 41:04.233
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

41:04.858 --> 41:07.858
were very funny, and they did it.

41:09.816 --> 41:15.150
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

41:15.733 --> 41:19.108
I should give Realisation to people first,

41:20.900 --> 41:24.275
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

41:24.733 --> 41:27.566
Now, I’m talking to you everything

41:27.608 --> 41:30.649
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

41:30.649 --> 41:33.649
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

41:34.025 --> 41:38.733
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

41:39.067 --> 41:40.941
and one who are not.

41:40.941 --> 41:45.025
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

41:45.108 --> 41:49.566
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

41:49.691 --> 41:55.900
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

41:55.900 --> 41:59.900
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

41:59.900 --> 42:03.900
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

42:03.941 --> 42:07.566
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

42:07.566 --> 42:12.108
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

42:12.566 --> 42:16.983
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

42:17.025 --> 42:20.067
where collectively you are understanding Me.

42:20.067 --> 42:23.150
The situation is not so bad as that was

42:23.275 --> 42:25.983
even at the time of Christ.

42:25.983 --> 42:28.108
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

42:28.108 --> 42:31.108
He was the only wise man going around.

42:31.566 --> 42:34.067
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

42:34.067 --> 42:37.108
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

42:37.108 --> 42:41.067
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

42:41.649 --> 42:44.775
Both of them, really,

42:45.108 --> 42:48.691
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

42:48.691 --> 42:50.858
which were all absolutely.

42:50.941 --> 42:53.858
But He talked absolutely…

42:53.900 --> 42:58.067
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

42:58.192 --> 43:00.192
and talked so openly.

43:00.775 --> 43:03.983
Then, in the same way, we can say,

43:04.192 --> 43:07.150
the Primordial Master state is that

43:07.608 --> 43:10.983
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

43:12.067 --> 43:16.025
He was also killed because He told the truth.

43:16.566 --> 43:20.150
Then came Nanaka;

43:20.566 --> 43:23.566
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

43:23.983 --> 43:27.858
and the people who really follow Him are just

43:29.067 --> 43:30.983
in the opposite direction.

43:30.983 --> 43:33.566
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

43:33.566 --> 43:36.733
so they are going in that way.

43:36.775 --> 43:40.691
You find even same thing with Christ;

43:40.691 --> 43:45.025
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

43:45.733 --> 43:48.691
Every religion is just the same.

43:48.691 --> 43:51.566
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

43:51.691 --> 43:55.108
Those who preach Gita are just…

43:55.566 --> 43:57.775
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

43:57.816 --> 44:00.649
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

44:00.649 --> 44:03.108
going down, taking people down.

44:03.108 --> 44:06.108
So it is common with all religions

44:07.067 --> 44:11.858
that they have always used the name of prophets

44:12.691 --> 44:19.067
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

44:19.067 --> 44:26.067
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

44:27.067 --> 44:29.566
So, now those who are alert about it,

44:29.566 --> 44:33.608
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

44:35.233 --> 44:37.233
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

44:37.608 --> 44:41.233
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

44:41.816 --> 44:45.816
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

44:46.900 --> 44:49.775
instead of going themselves down.

44:49.816 --> 44:55.649
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

44:55.816 --> 44:59.649
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

44:59.649 --> 45:02.275
If Athena could be awakened here,

45:02.608 --> 45:06.566
this place could be of very great help to us.

45:07.150 --> 45:12.775
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

45:12.775 --> 45:17.566
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

45:17.566 --> 45:23.150
also they have lots of qualities of

45:23.150 --> 45:29.691
understanding the worthlessness of

45:29.983 --> 45:36.649
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

45:36.816 --> 45:39.025
But the immorality grew,

45:39.025 --> 45:42.649
now, because they started copying Westerners;

45:42.816 --> 45:46.067
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

45:46.608 --> 45:50.733
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

45:51.067 --> 45:54.608
Before that the women were very moral,

45:54.608 --> 45:57.067
very good women lived here,

45:57.566 --> 46:01.983
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

46:02.566 --> 46:06.566
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

46:06.608 --> 46:08.941
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

46:08.941 --> 46:11.566
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

46:11.566 --> 46:14.566
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

46:14.566 --> 46:18.192
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

46:18.608 --> 46:22.608
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

46:23.067 --> 46:25.983
They may use a woman who has no character

46:25.983 --> 46:28.192
but they respect the woman who has character

46:28.192 --> 46:30.566
and also respect the mother.

46:30.691 --> 46:33.983
So there are lots of qualities in this country

46:34.025 --> 46:37.649
which are still existing,

46:37.816 --> 46:42.192
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

46:42.608 --> 46:46.608
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

46:46.733 --> 46:52.900
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

46:52.941 --> 46:56.233
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

46:56.775 --> 46:58.816
May God bless you!

47:15.858 --> 47:18.941
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

47:18.941 --> 47:21.858
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

47:34.816 --> 47:38.816
He was very much respected in India, always,

47:39.649 --> 47:42.649
Alexander was very much respected in India,

47:42.900 --> 47:45.900
and because he went away

47:46.608 --> 47:49.608
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

47:50.816 --> 47:55.067
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

47:56.108 --> 47:58.275
I think he got quite detached

47:58.733 --> 48:01.941
after coming to India. Anybody who has

48:01.941 --> 48:06.108
come to invade India, and has really gained something

48:06.108 --> 48:09.233
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

48:09.566 --> 48:12.566
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

48:12.566 --> 48:13.733
three hundred years.

48:13.733 --> 48:16.691
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

48:17.566 --> 48:20.566
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

48:20.941 --> 48:24.608
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

48:24.816 --> 48:26.816
nothing went into their heads.

48:28.733 --> 48:32.275
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

48:32.649 --> 48:35.192
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

48:35.192 --> 48:39.192
So many are there even now living in the forests.

48:40.608 --> 48:45.067
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

48:45.067 --> 48:48.566
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

48:48.775 --> 48:51.983
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

48:51.983 --> 48:55.691
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

48:55.983 --> 48:59.566
who was at the time of Alexander.

48:59.775 --> 49:04.275
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

49:04.649 --> 49:07.775
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

49:07.900 --> 49:10.941
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

49:11.608 --> 49:16.192
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

49:16.566 --> 49:17.733
to England;

49:19.816 --> 49:21.733
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

49:21.733 --> 49:24.733
and the sign of awareness is this, that

49:24.733 --> 49:28.067
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

49:28.900 --> 49:32.900
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

49:33.608 --> 49:37.691
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

49:37.858 --> 49:41.025
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

49:41.025 --> 49:44.816
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

49:44.858 --> 49:46.566
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

49:46.649 --> 49:48.608
so he went back and told his king that,

49:48.608 --> 49:51.733
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

49:51.733 --> 49:53.649
They are not Muslims”.

49:56.025 --> 49:57.608
So simple he was.

49:57.608 --> 50:00.816
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

50:00.816 --> 50:03.733
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

50:04.233 --> 50:05.608
He was a nice man.

50:05.608 --> 50:08.733
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

50:08.733 --> 50:11.150
but still certain respect they showed, like

50:11.566 --> 50:13.941
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

50:14.816 --> 50:16.649
They still call it Mumbai.

50:16.941 --> 50:18.691
many words Mumbai

50:18.816 --> 50:22.941
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

50:23.067 --> 50:25.733
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

50:25.858 --> 50:27.233
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

50:27.691 --> 50:29.691
so they call it Mumbai –

50:29.941 --> 50:31.941
is the name of the Goddess.

50:32.150 --> 50:34.150
So they didn’t want to change it.

50:34.649 --> 50:37.691
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

50:37.858 --> 50:39.816
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

50:39.858 --> 50:42.067
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

50:42.150 --> 50:43.649
I said, “It is.”

50:43.941 --> 50:47.566
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

50:50.941 --> 50:54.067
So you see the… see the awareness,

50:54.067 --> 50:56.733
you can see the awareness of people

50:56.900 --> 51:02.108
because they were so aware about the serenity,

51:02.150 --> 51:05.733
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

51:05.858 --> 51:07.608
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

51:07.608 --> 51:10.150
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

51:10.941 --> 51:14.192
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

51:14.608 --> 51:16.858
But the English could have gone and found out

51:16.858 --> 51:20.733
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

51:20.816 --> 51:22.025
But they did not.

51:22.025 --> 51:25.025
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

51:25.067 --> 51:27.733
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

51:28.233 --> 51:31.233
because, you see, that respect

51:31.775 --> 51:34.108
for serenity and all these things,

51:34.566 --> 51:38.900
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

51:38.983 --> 51:42.858
Now the children of Britain

51:43.067 --> 51:46.608
are better, are very different, very different.

51:46.858 --> 51:50.233
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

51:51.649 --> 51:57.775
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

51:58.775 --> 52:02.775
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

52:03.566 --> 52:04.941
they came with respect.

52:06.150 --> 52:12.108
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

52:13.067 --> 52:15.067
And now, as the time has passed,

52:15.067 --> 52:17.649
I find Britishers have respect for others,

52:18.025 --> 52:21.233
they’re respecting, many.

52:21.233 --> 52:24.691
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

52:24.691 --> 52:28.649
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

52:33.941 --> 52:37.941
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

52:38.275 --> 52:40.775
That is the part lacking in England.

52:40.900 --> 52:44.233
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

52:44.608 --> 52:46.941
then what sort of a heart it must be?

52:47.775 --> 52:50.775
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

52:53.983 --> 53:01.150
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

53:01.691 --> 53:07.733
respecting others, respecting their culture,

53:07.733 --> 53:11.858
respecting their lifestyle.

53:12.108 --> 53:17.608
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

53:17.941 --> 53:21.566
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

53:21.941 --> 53:24.775
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

53:24.941 --> 53:28.150
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

53:28.649 --> 53:31.192
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

53:31.192 --> 53:34.192
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

53:34.858 --> 53:39.691
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

53:39.858 --> 53:43.275
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

53:43.608 --> 53:46.691
So that is there but just theory.

53:46.858 --> 53:50.608
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

53:50.775 --> 53:56.192
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

53:56.566 --> 53:59.566
and fasting for South Africa.

54:00.983 --> 54:03.275
So between the South African awareness

54:03.649 --> 54:06.983
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

54:07.108 --> 54:11.108
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

54:12.067 --> 54:16.900
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

54:17.025 --> 54:20.025
I think it can transform the whole world.

54:20.608 --> 54:24.067
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

54:24.941 --> 54:26.983
It has to be respect.

54:31.816 --> 54:33.941
It is not insulting now,

54:34.150 --> 54:37.608
but it is not positive respect.

54:37.775 --> 54:41.691
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

54:41.691 --> 54:45.275
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

54:45.275 --> 54:48.192
This is what I have been talking about,

54:48.608 --> 54:51.983
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

54:52.816 --> 54:56.941
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

54:57.275 --> 54:59.691
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

54:59.691 --> 55:02.691
because still they have a sense of respect.

55:05.649 --> 55:09.649
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

55:10.858 --> 55:15.025
That part is there, that one has to learn.

55:15.025 --> 55:19.025
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

55:20.108 --> 55:26.108
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

55:26.733 --> 55:29.941
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

55:29.941 --> 55:33.900
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

55:38.900 --> 55:41.275
And respect is something from your heart.

55:41.858 --> 55:45.691
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

55:45.816 --> 55:48.108
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

55:49.067 --> 55:52.858
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

55:52.858 --> 55:56.025
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

55:56.025 --> 55:59.275
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

56:01.858 --> 56:06.108
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

56:06.941 --> 56:09.983
and when that works out then

56:09.983 --> 56:13.691
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

56:13.900 --> 56:18.816
high state of understanding of Divinity.

56:19.067 --> 56:24.067
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

56:24.691 --> 56:28.691
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

56:29.067 --> 56:32.233
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

56:32.233 --> 56:36.233
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

56:36.900 --> 56:39.150
And that it’s not what you get,

56:39.566 --> 56:41.733
it’s not what you have,

56:41.858 --> 56:46.858
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

56:49.941 --> 56:53.983
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

56:54.067 --> 56:56.192
because there’s a big understanding

56:56.192 --> 56:58.275
now between you and the Divine,

56:58.608 --> 57:01.067
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

57:01.150 --> 57:05.150
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

57:06.233 --> 57:10.608
learn that respect, then things will work out.

57:10.649 --> 57:12.775
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

57:12.816 --> 57:16.275
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

57:16.566 --> 57:18.025
May God bless you!
