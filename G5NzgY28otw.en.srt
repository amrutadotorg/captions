1
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:25,519
To see so many Sahaja Yogis assembled here,
I’m sure the devil must have run away long

2
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,260
time back.

3
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:44,219
And the caravan must have left but I hope
we are aware of it and we forget about our

4
00:03:44,219 --> 00:03:52,310
fears of our catches, of our past, of all
the nonsense we have done so far.

5
00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:06,110
Suddenly in My presence, I think, people get
into a sense of guilt.

6
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:18,759
I’m here to soothe you, to cleanse you,
to make you beautiful and not to feel guilty.

7
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:33,520
Actually when we start 
looking at ourselves the first thing you notice

8
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:43,000
is that there’s a block on the Agnya, but
this block in the Agnya is the worst thing

9
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:49,469
that can happen to us because it is the door
of the Kundalini.

10
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:53,940
She reaches up to Vishuddhi all right, and
then She has to move forward, this Agnya stops

11
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:54,940
it.

12
00:04:54,940 --> 00:05:02,970
That’s why we have left Vishuddhi, we have
all the Vishuddhi problems.

13
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:12,120
The flow cannot take place.

14
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,770
Also this is one of the reasons we feel guilty
because of left Vishuddhi.

15
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,449
It’s a symptom of a disease.

16
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:24,620
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

17
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,550
So we have to understand first of all that
we’re Sahaja Yogis.

18
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:37,690
We’re not ordinary people or we’re not
people who have not known the truth; we have

19
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,690
known the truth.

20
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,560
We have to be completely aware of it.

21
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,060
That’s one truth if you establish, you have
established yourself quite a lot.

22
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:54,350
Now the ordinary people as you have seen on
Oxford St., you see, they wear Indian dresses

23
00:05:54,350 --> 00:06:04,910
funnily tied, they don’t know how to tie
it up, dhotis and saris and they shake their

24
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:15,270
heads and buy some of these, what we call
them, shindis or bodhis or I don’t know

25
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:27,190
what you call, tails, pigtails, and attach
them with some glue and they start dancing.

26
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:38,800
When they dance, their pigtail falls off,
and the saris and the dhotis, everything start

27
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,539
opening out.

28
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:44,710
That’s a very funny, ridiculous scene.

29
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:49,380
One side you see the punks and another side
you see this nonsense, in the name of Shri

30
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,380
Krishna, that’s even worse.

31
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:55,449
Punks do not do it in the name of, I don’t
know if they do it in the name of King Solomon.

32
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:05,199
But they do it in somebody’s name, these
people that is so great as Shri Krishna.

33
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:23,750
On the contrary, Shri Krishna’s hair are
described in all the books and in all the

34
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,539
poetry that poets could sing about.

35
00:07:28,539 --> 00:07:31,729
He was never shaven-headed.

36
00:07:31,729 --> 00:07:40,190
It is impossible to understand how these people
got the idea that you must shave your head.

37
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,039
So the Shri Krishna’s aspect of Yogeshwara
has been so misunderstood.

38
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:56,340
It’s absolutely misunderstood because we
cannot understand that the truth is covered

39
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,819
with maya, always.

40
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:02,669
And you should keep maya on one side and go
to the truth.

41
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,573
Instead of that, we get lost in the maya,
like very simple example, as it is, that He

42
00:08:08,573 --> 00:08:12,860
is a Yogeshwara; so these people have idea
of a yogi, that He should be shaven, He should

43
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,839
wear that dhoti, dirty one, and must put on
a pigtail.

44
00:08:17,839 --> 00:08:22,729
Another concept, maya is a concept.

45
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:27,589
And when you start living on those concepts
of your own, you may gather it up with something

46
00:08:27,589 --> 00:08:34,680
else, you may think that Christ was a person
who was a sanyasi, who used to wear another

47
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,829
kind of a robe and He had a beard and He had
hair like this.

48
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:43,169
All those ideas, “So if we become like this,
we’d be very great yogis.”

49
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:50,128
These are all our concepts about someone whom
we have never seen, whom we have never known.

50
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:59,330
And because we live with those concepts, we
get limited.

51
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:10,380
It’s very difficult for these people to
break through because maya can only be broken

52
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,380
through realization.

53
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:14,640
That’s why first thing in Sahaja Yoga is
realization.

54
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,830
Take your realization.

55
00:09:15,830 --> 00:09:19,070
You are a drunkard, all right, get your realization.

56
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,840
You are a drug addict, get your realization.

57
00:09:21,840 --> 00:09:24,070
You are a bad man, get your realization.

58
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,890
Anyone, get your realization first; put the
light first into a person.

59
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,480
Let him see for himself.

60
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:40,120
So all this identification with different
concepts is responsible for giving us a very

61
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,430
mayami or illusive personality.

62
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:53,639
We live in an illusive personality, live with
it, enjoy it and we think we are perfectly

63
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:55,589
all right.

64
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:10,760
Now if you are aware you are Sahaja Yogis
and you have come here for Shri Krishna Puja,

65
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,340
what is the preparation we have to do.

66
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:20,529
We’re Sahaja Yogis, we know about Kundalini,
we know about Vishuddhis, we know about Shri

67
00:10:20,529 --> 00:10:21,769
Krishna.

68
00:10:21,769 --> 00:10:34,449
All right, how are we going to prepare ourselves
for the puja of Shri Krishna?

69
00:10:34,449 --> 00:10:40,750
First of all, He tried to break all the concepts.

70
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:56,649
First the concept He broke was that you have
to be like a ascetic to look.

71
00:10:56,649 --> 00:11:04,339
He broke this concept; He lived like the king.

72
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:13,370
In His childhood He used to go and play with
the cows.

73
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:29,930
And there He would use a peacock’s feather
to decorate Himself, and He would listen to

74
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:35,230
beautiful music of the river Yamuna and reproduce
it.

75
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:45,440
He was leelala, He was the one who created
all kinds of mirth.

76
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:53,499
What is mirth in French?

77
00:11:53,499 --> 00:12:03,180
They don’t have mirth, I believe.

78
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:11,480
It’s not fun, it’s more than… , it’s
mirth.

79
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:19,649
Mirth is sweeter than fun, all right, sweet
fun.

80
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:23,410
What a word!

81
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:28,149
Sweet fun!

82
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:37,129
<Laughter> This is mirth, now what is happening
to you is mirth.

83
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:43,680
I’m creating mirth in which you feel tickled,
you know.

84
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,269
Mirth is something where you feel tickled.

85
00:12:50,269 --> 00:13:00,779
So He tried to create mirth, never seriousness
but He was not frivolous.

86
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,600
He was Yogeshwara.

87
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:15,629
He was not frivolous, so this difference between
frivolity and mirth is to be understood only

88
00:13:15,629 --> 00:13:25,300
through Him because He’s also discretion.

89
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:36,509
Mirth is joy-giving, frivolity is destructive.

90
00:13:36,509 --> 00:13:45,850
Anything frivolous if you do…

91
00:13:45,850 --> 00:14:02,100
So we have to be in a state of mirth, so no
question of feeling guilty comes in, you’re

92
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,059
not prisoners are we?

93
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:14,589
We’re prisoners of our own concepts and
our own ideas and our own degradation.

94
00:14:14,589 --> 00:14:19,619
We degrade ourselves, God does not.

95
00:14:19,619 --> 00:14:32,970
So we should be in the state of complete mirth
and enjoyment.

96
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:36,920
Now it has rained, all right.

97
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:40,899
That’s a very good thing to happen today.

98
00:14:40,899 --> 00:14:42,300
Yesterday I was listening to the program,
I was just smiling, because I knew it would

99
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:55,649
not work out that way.

100
00:14:55,649 --> 00:15:07,100
And in India, on this day, when they celebrate
in the morning, children of the village or

101
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:16,040
children of the particular areas gather together.

102
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:27,430
And for them the house-holders tie a little
pitcher, which we call as a matka, and in

103
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:32,410
that there is money, anything valuable they
want to give to the children, sweets, everything

104
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:37,749
put inside, and is tied up in the air.

105
00:15:37,749 --> 00:15:45,399
Normally it rains, if it doesn’t rain then
they pour water on the children to make them

106
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:46,550
feel it’s raining.

107
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:54,629
Rain is very much connected with Shri Krishna.

108
00:15:54,629 --> 00:16:03,470
So the children come and they go in a way
that the taller boys are first, then smaller,

109
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:09,480
then smaller like a pyramid they go up till
at the end there’s one boy who’s sort

110
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:14,800
of representing Shri Krishna and then he breaks
that.

111
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:22,220
And from there everything falls down and flowers,
everything on them, they take the money, they

112
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,870
take all those things and start enjoying.

113
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:33,509
Then they go to another place, the whole day
they are moving in the city like that and

114
00:16:33,509 --> 00:16:47,660
every good house-holder ties that matka for
these children, for them to come and enjoy

115
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:48,660
themselves.

116
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:58,309
That’s in the real sense, is the Krishna
Astami in Gokul where He lived as a child.

117
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:03,379
Now why is He so much connected with rain?

118
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:22,230
Once all His friends and He were looking after
the cows and Indra felt that He is very powerful,

119
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:35,900
somehow, I don’t know, He gets into jealousies
sometimes.

120
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:52,410
And He sent rain to test His patience, His
leela, His play, His mirth.

121
00:17:52,410 --> 00:18:02,870
It rained and rained and rained and they did
not know what to do.

122
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,500
So there was a mountain called Govardhan.

123
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:17,690
Shri Krishna lifted it with His stick or His
finger and just put it up on top of His finger,

124
00:18:17,690 --> 00:18:18,690
like that.

125
00:18:18,690 --> 00:18:23,760
That’s why He is called as Govardhan Dhari.

126
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:34,420
And the whole mountain was on top and all
the children joined Him and now the cows and

127
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:44,140
He asked the children, “You also put your
sticks up to help.”

128
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:49,240
And they all put their sticks and standing
very sweetly holding the Govardhan.

129
00:18:49,240 --> 00:19:02,049
That is one of His names, Govardhan Dhari.

130
00:19:02,049 --> 00:19:08,760
So the rain had to come and the cows with
their bells have to remind us.

131
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:17,990
Imagine the lake has a name which is a black;
Krishna means black, Krishna word itself means

132
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,050
black.

133
00:19:19,050 --> 00:19:24,570
How Sahaj the whole thing has worked out.

134
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:33,290
Can you see the coincidences are so Sahaj
but are so <inaudible>.

135
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:46,410
And here we are sitting, it’s raining, nicely
enjoying everything.

136
00:19:46,410 --> 00:20:03,580
But on the contrary when we start not enjoying
we play into, either into our ego or superego.

137
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:18,929
Supposing we are starved people, tortured
people, then we start making others like ourselves.

138
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:25,350
We like to make them suffer and torture them.

139
00:20:25,350 --> 00:20:31,470
That’s why I always say, “Poverty is leprosy.”

140
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:36,059
Anybody who is in poverty can develop horrible
things within themselves.

141
00:20:36,059 --> 00:20:45,780
It is never to be sided with, not to be sympathized
but to be completely eradicated.

142
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:53,000
Another side is the ego where we try to dominate
others and enjoy that.

143
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:58,649
There’s no joy, there’s no joy in dominating
others and saying things to others.

144
00:20:58,649 --> 00:21:03,429
I was sorry to hear yesterday that there are
some girls who are married, some Indian girls

145
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:09,350
who are married and their husbands are not
respecting them and troubling them.

146
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:11,990
It hurt Me very much.

147
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:17,260
That shows they’re so low level people,
very low level.

148
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,389
Such a mediocracy, such useless people.

149
00:21:18,389 --> 00:21:23,590
They should have never come to Sahaja Yoga
and deceived us like this.

150
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:32,769
They will go to hell direct, I can tell you
this.

151
00:21:32,769 --> 00:21:39,769
Now there are some who are caught up with
their superego; they suffer from some sort

152
00:21:39,769 --> 00:21:46,059
of a funny Sahaja Yoga schizophrenia.

153
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:53,450
And they don’t want to get rid or it.

154
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:58,470
They just don’t want to understand that
they’re not normal people, they have to

155
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,160
be perfectly all right.

156
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:12,299
They make everyone miserable, jump on to all
the places where they should not be.

157
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:18,710
Like a person who has got, say, example, tuberculosis,
a disease which is contagious.

158
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:28,570
Must understand he has got tuberculosis, keep
out, don’t give it to others, at least.

159
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:37,000
But those who have got badhas will definitely
come, either they’ll give big lectures.

160
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:47,410
I start seeing them like big bhoots speaking,
or if not they have badhas then they will

161
00:22:47,410 --> 00:22:49,990
come at a place where they should not be.

162
00:22:49,990 --> 00:22:54,340
They’ll put their hands in the prasada,
they’ll be sitting in the puja in the front,

163
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,340
all kinds of things they’ll be doing, catching
people.

164
00:22:55,340 --> 00:23:04,669
And they enjoy it because they are identified
with the badhas.

165
00:23:04,669 --> 00:23:13,100
How will they improve?

166
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:20,120
There’s one fellow who is a bhootish fellow,
we have had him for, I think, for at least

167
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:29,730
for a century I should say, and he’s giving
lectures to others, “You must clean the

168
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:34,610
shoes of all the Sahaja Yogis to get rid of
your ego.”

169
00:23:34,610 --> 00:23:46,029
So such a gross, depraved and low level people
are still in Sahaja Yoga.

170
00:23:46,029 --> 00:23:50,639
So the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga becomes less.

171
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,990
If you eat rice with stones in it, how will
you enjoy it?

172
00:23:53,990 --> 00:23:59,519
And that’s what it is.

173
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:16,730
We are here to enjoy the blessings of God,
to have the mirth but still we are living

174
00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:23,760
with all joy-killing things that we have.

175
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,610
How are we going to get rid of those things.

176
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:39,190
So at least we do not become thorns in the
lives of others.

177
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:45,309
So the so-called free will, I’m happy Rustom
has told you about it, is nothing but your

178
00:24:45,309 --> 00:24:50,139
ego and superego because you’re not in the
center.

179
00:24:50,139 --> 00:25:03,080
In the center, you have nothing but freedom,
that’s all, nothing but freedom; nothing

180
00:25:03,080 --> 00:25:08,450
like free will, freedom, complete freedom.

181
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:24,980
There’s nothing like will or nothing like
bhoots, nothing like bondage, it’s entire

182
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:29,779
avenue of freedom.

183
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:44,450
Then this freedom is the knowledge, this freedom
is the love, this freedom is the discretion.

184
00:25:44,450 --> 00:25:57,140
Then you say God gives you freedom and others
freedom equally then you act which doesn’t

185
00:25:57,140 --> 00:26:07,929
bound you nor anybody else because it is knowledge,
it is discretion.

186
00:26:07,929 --> 00:26:16,080
Age does not matter, what age you are.

187
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:26,600
I’ve seen some also very old people singing
beautifully and enjoying Sahaja Yoga and make

188
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,149
Me enjoy also.

189
00:26:29,149 --> 00:26:34,980
Life is for us to enjoy, nothing else.

190
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,279
But because we’re not free people, we cannot
enjoy.

191
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:50,620
There is no bondage of any evil thought which
keeps you down.

192
00:26:50,620 --> 00:27:11,600
It is so subtle but penetrating into every
that is gross, that is Shri Krishna’s beautiful

193
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:19,740
flute which creates a picture of the nature.

194
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:28,460
The description <Sanskrit expression>, the
whole thing becomes silent like a picture.

195
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:36,470
So this evening we’ll have the puja, we’ll
have all the enjoyment of Shri Krishna’s

196
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,470
blessings upon us.

197
00:27:37,470 --> 00:27:54,760
There’s no end to the stories of Shri Krishna,
all full of mirth and play and innocence that

198
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,850
kills rakshashas, devils.

199
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:10,029
So today I’ve talked to you about His childhood,
and the puja I’ll tell you about Gita.

200
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,869
May God bless you.
