EXCERPTS

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:22.501
Now Saraswati is the Goddess of learning

00:00:22.702 --> 00:00:29.439
and Mahasaraswati is the Goddess
of knowledge, which is pure knowledge.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.806
Now the Goddess of learning, Saraswati,
has got four arms.

00:00:37.007 --> 00:00:43.768
She wears white, white cloths because
is a sign of purity. She's a virgin.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:51.842
Then She has in Her hand the vina, that is
the instrument

00:00:52.043 --> 00:00:59.719
which was the first instrument that was
created by the Gods

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:09.189
to play the classical music, or you can say
the music that was appreciated by the Gods.

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.079
So that's one is vina, and the two other
hands are:

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.167
one has got a rosary in the hand,
in the sense a person

00:01:22.368 --> 00:01:30.860
who is learned should be a person who should
be very much detached. A saintly person;

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:36.126
should not have too many attachments
and should not be -

00:01:36.327 --> 00:01:41.043
it always happens - a person who is
a learned man, who is over-educated

00:01:41.244 --> 00:01:44.830
he is not so much interested in the family,
he becomes more ascetic,

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:50.947
is very disciplined, self disciplined.
Is very meticulous, is very efficient,

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:56.215
is very right-sided, as you can call it
you see, so all that goes hand in hand.

00:01:56.416 --> 00:02:02.422
And then is in the left hand She has
a book,

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:11.209
so She - that means that the Power
of the Lakshmi

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.455
gives you - the power of Saraswati
gives you

00:02:16.656 --> 00:02:24.014
the full creativity by which you can create
books. That also means that.

00:02:24.215 --> 00:02:27.837
But must have in the books means that
whatever you're doing now -

00:02:28.038 --> 00:02:34.340
supposing you're doing Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja
Yoga is say concerning the Divine.

00:02:34.541 --> 00:02:40.436
So we must know what are in the books,
means in the Scriptures.

00:02:40.637 --> 00:02:46.264
We must know how it relates to the
Scriptures; like it should not be something

00:02:46.465 --> 00:02:51.183
just coming like a mushroom knowledge,
but it should be related

00:02:51.384 --> 00:02:58.066
to the books, means which is already
written down,

00:02:58.267 --> 00:03:01.456
which is already being typed, being
printed.

00:03:01.657 --> 00:03:06.517
But that doesn't mean that it is a bookish
knowledge,

00:03:06.718 --> 00:03:10.408
but it is whatever you have found out,
whatever you have discovered

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.815
has to be related to the books. And that is
the Power She gives us,

00:03:15.016 --> 00:03:18.245
that She relates. Like maybe you must have
read many books

00:03:18.446 --> 00:03:21.720
where there are quotations, even I use
many quotations,

00:03:21.921 --> 00:03:24.563
and I give you now this all this knowledge
is already -

00:03:24.764 --> 00:03:28.940
part of it, I should say not the all of it,
but part of it - is from the books

00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:31.973
in the sense it is written about Saraswati
and everything.

00:03:32.174 --> 00:03:37.287
So one must learn how to respect the books,
specially the Scriptures.

00:03:37.488 --> 00:03:42.825
 And She's the One Who gives you
the penetration power into these books,

00:03:43.026 --> 00:03:45.707
to know what is the truth and what is not -

00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:51.583
penetration power to understand what is
written between the lines,

00:03:51.784 --> 00:03:56.968
what is the subtle meaning of the whole
thing - that is the Power of Saraswati.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:03:59.861
There's another Power She has is
Vak Shakti,

00:04:00.062 --> 00:04:04.905
by which you give speech. She's the One
Who gives you the power to speak.

00:04:05.106 --> 00:04:10.921
She's the One Who gives you the power
to communicate, by speech,

00:04:11.122 --> 00:04:19.810
by your writings, by all the drama or plays
you have

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:26.928
or films you have - any kind
of communications that are done

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:35.198
through the Power of Saraswati has that
intellect behind it,

00:04:35.399 --> 00:04:39.841
and that intellect comes from Her Power.

00:04:40.042 --> 00:04:43.351
So even Shri Krishna has to use Her Power.

00:04:43.552 --> 00:04:49.125
Everybody has to use Her Power, because
if you don't use the Saraswati's Power,

00:04:49.326 --> 00:04:56.466
then only Shri Krishna's one Power is that
He is a diplomat

00:04:56.667 --> 00:05:03.864
and that diplomacy comes from the Power
of Saraswati.

00:05:04.065 --> 00:05:08.322
So everybody whosoever you find as
brilliant

00:05:08.523 --> 00:05:15.879
is, actually has been endowed with this
Power of Saraswati.

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:20.721
The people who are worshipping Saraswati
have to be detached people

00:05:20.922 --> 00:05:24.083
because those who are learned, those
who are artists,

00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:27.185
those who are producing art and all those
 things

00:05:27.386 --> 00:05:30.285
are not so much rewarded in their life,
lifetime.

00:05:30.454 --> 00:05:33.985
So if they're detached from Lakshmi,
if they're detached from things,

00:05:34.186 --> 00:05:36.520
then they just produce it for their
own joy.

00:05:36.721 --> 00:05:38.895
They don't worry how much money we are
going to get.

00:05:39.096 --> 00:05:41.355
So the Lakshmi's Powers are

00:05:41.556 --> 00:05:43.479
to give you a great learning,

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.710
to give you a great understanding
intellectually

00:05:46.911 --> 00:05:53.539
and to give you a kind of a personality
that outshines others by your brilliance.

00:05:53.740 --> 00:06:00.188
But it may not give you money, it may not
give you lots of possessions,

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:03.852
but it gives you possessions which are -

00:06:04.069 --> 00:06:09.394
cannot be stolen, which cannot be
taken away.

00:06:09.595 --> 00:06:17.237
And She is a person of humility, so
the person who is learned has to be humble.

00:06:17.426 --> 00:06:27.400
If he is not humble, then he's not learned
according to the Principle of Saraswati.

00:06:27.601 --> 00:06:32.600
She has - the person who is very much
learned

00:06:32.801 --> 00:06:36.569
has to bow down with the fruits of his
learnings,

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:43.643
so that a person who is learned and thinks
no end of himself is a person

00:06:43.844 --> 00:06:49.934
who has not yet learned fully,
is a half-baked person

00:06:50.135 --> 00:06:55.704
and that's why a egoist cannot be a learned
man.

00:06:55.904 --> 00:06:59.356
Learned man is always extremely humble.

00:06:59.557 --> 00:07:05.824
That is the sign, because She is the Power
which gives you humility,

00:07:06.025 --> 00:07:11.604
not humility of a businessman but a genuine
humility She gives you.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:20.813
There are so many qualities and I think
I'll be able to write one day about them.

00:07:25.067 --> 00:07:30.874
A STORY TOLD BY SHRI MATAJI

00:07:39.335 --> 00:07:42.600
Gradually you will start seeing the divine
play,

00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:47.610
how things work out, how it helps you.

00:07:47.811 --> 00:07:55.367
But supposing God has brought something
before you.

00:07:55.568 --> 00:08:01.586
Dr. Worlikar told Me a nice story about
this which is very interesting,

00:08:01.787 --> 00:08:07.311
that between the Goddess of wealth and
the Goddess of education

00:08:07.512 --> 00:08:13.677
there was a little conflict. You can say
education or the Saraswati,

00:08:13.878 --> 00:08:22.435
which if neglected or if too much adored
can make you egoistical,

00:08:22.636 --> 00:08:27.398
in the sense that if you become a person
who is after learning, learning, learning,

00:08:27.599 --> 00:08:32.838
you can be thrown on the other side.
So this lady (Saraswati)

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:36.857
wanted to test the power of wealth.

00:08:37.073 --> 00:08:42.241
So She said to the Lakshmi that, “All right,
let’s see, on this person.”

00:08:42.465 --> 00:08:48.971
This person was a beggar, he needed money,
and very much.

00:08:49.172 --> 00:08:56.289
So Lakshmi put lot of money in a big
utensils, what we call handa,

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:00.107
and put it in his way.

00:09:00.308 --> 00:09:08.579
This fellow was walking, so Saraswati
entered into his mind.

00:09:08.780 --> 00:09:13.290
As soon as Saraswati enters into the mind
he became egoistical,

00:09:13.491 --> 00:09:16.505
and he didn’t even look at that, he just
walked off.

00:09:16.706 --> 00:09:19.012
That was his need, but he walked off.

00:09:19.213 --> 00:09:24.408
So it suggests one thing, that when people
become egoistical,

00:09:24.609 --> 00:09:31.911
start making their own plans, start making
their own suggestions and images they form,

00:09:32.112 --> 00:09:36.791
then what happens that the Divine,

00:09:36.992 --> 00:09:42.154
which is trying to supply for your need,
for your wants,

00:09:42.355 --> 00:09:46.208
for your solutions, disappears.

00:09:46.782 --> 00:09:52.739
This is what happens, that we do not allow
the Divine to have its play.

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:58.016
This is not only on material level; it is
true also on emotional level,

00:09:58.217 --> 00:10:06.134
it is true also on our physical level,

00:10:06.335 --> 00:10:11.803
but the best of all that it is true about
spiritual level also.

00:10:12.004 --> 00:10:14.827
So we should not miss the point.
Let the Divine

00:10:15.028 --> 00:10:18.108
play its role, and we should be able to see.

00:10:18.309 --> 00:10:23.478
Like Krishna has said, “Karmanyevadikaraste”
– “It is our job to do the job.”
