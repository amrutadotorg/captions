00:00:06.381 --> 00:00:15.431
My father was a brilliant man. He was leader
of the people who were fighting the British.

00:00:16.172 --> 00:00:23.112
Very learned, very learned man. He went 
to jail many a times. Last time, when he

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:30.221
went after 1942 movement, it was for
three years regularly he was in jail.

00:00:31.405 --> 00:00:37.445
But there was one fellow who was a friend
of My father, he came and told My mother

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:44.146
that you must apologize because we don't
want your husband to be in jail, he has so

00:00:44.146 --> 00:00:51.012
many children and this and that. My mother
said, "I can't do that. His will. He wants

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:59.878
to go to jail, he has to go." Like that, 
you see, we have glimpses of very ideal

00:00:59.878 --> 00:01:06.291
type of people during that time. They didn't
think of money, their properties, nothing.

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:13.136
So, sacrifice was immense. Nowadays
we can't even think of such a thing.

00:01:14.444 --> 00:01:21.184
But I did feel that the English should leave
our country. They have no right to be there.

00:01:22.966 --> 00:01:28.126
So, I did feel that somebody has to tell
them that this is wrong. So, I had a great

00:01:28.126 --> 00:01:34.975
sense of right and wrong but I didn't 
know it was Spirituality. It was a innate

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:41.136
quality (with)in Me. But most of the people,
in those days were like that, in India

00:01:41.478 --> 00:01:49.588
because the urge for freedom was so great
and that people were fighting for freedom,

00:01:50.025 --> 00:01:58.295
so they could not think of all those 
things. Once I had to speak when I was

00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:06.709
7 years of age, for Mahatma Gandhi's 
fasting and I spoke to thousands of people

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:17.688
I was a little girl and I told them how we
should forget about caste system and how

00:02:17.688 --> 00:02:22.516
we should marry each other.
I was such a little girl as 7 years.
