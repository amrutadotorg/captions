00:00:04.313 --> 00:00:09.952
But we can say one thing, that, at least from my experience,

00:00:10.072 --> 00:00:13.657
I feel that in the beginning, whatever starts in a small way,

00:00:13.777 --> 00:00:17.429
in a struggling way, really is embedding itself nicely,

00:00:17.549 --> 00:00:19.342
into the Mother Earth.

00:00:19.462 --> 00:00:21.028
And is a very good sign.

00:00:21.148 --> 00:00:24.604
Because that’s the way, it always works out better.

00:00:24.724 --> 00:00:27.623
Whatever is frivolous, or whatever is cheapish,

00:00:27.743 --> 00:00:32.745
or which spreads out without much difficulties, is of no use.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.950
It’s like grass. Anybody can take it away.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.064
So the embeddiment and all that, has to go inside.

00:00:40.184 --> 00:00:42.814
As you are shaking it nicely to go inside.

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:46.254
And that’s what it is. Where, you should be very happy,

00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:47.969
that it is working out that way.

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:54.221
Somebody has come? Let him come. Come along.

00:01:01.626 --> 00:01:08.538
So the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, may look to be little shaky.

00:01:08.658 --> 00:01:12.039
May look to be little feeble. But it is not.

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.291
It is getting stronger and stronger.

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:19.342
And it is getting embedded into the Mother Earth.

00:01:19.462 --> 00:01:24.468
And, that is what, is the test of you being the real seekers.

00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:28.162
You being the people who want truth.

00:01:28.282 --> 00:01:32.220
Who do not want a big show, big,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.923
sort of a, community sitting there,

00:01:36.043 --> 00:01:41.533
all going mad with some sort of a shouting, screaming and nonsense.

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:45.443
As it is you know, Sahaja Yoga, is a living process.

00:01:45.563 --> 00:01:48.842
And, it goes both, grows both, both ways.

00:01:48.962 --> 00:01:51.393
Upwards and downwards.

00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:54.063
In the beginning it grows more downwards,

00:01:54.183 --> 00:01:57.215
and in the downwards process, we have to depend,

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:01.467
on our vibrations very much. We must all the time remember,

00:02:01.587 --> 00:02:06.138
that we are realized souls. That we have got vibrations.

00:02:06.258 --> 00:02:08.286
This is the way we have to judge.

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:10.556
This is the way we have to understand.

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:15.053
The vibration is the only way, that we’ll know others.

00:02:15.173 --> 00:02:19.120
Not by something, something you will feel

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.184
that the person looks very sweet and nice and,

00:02:22.304 --> 00:02:24.530
may a snake come out of that person.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.433
So best is, to judge a person, through vibrations.

00:02:28.553 --> 00:02:30.715
Judge everything through vibrations.

00:02:30.835 --> 00:02:33.382
Not through your own understanding,

00:02:33.502 --> 00:02:37.346
or superficial methods of judging others.

00:02:37.466 --> 00:02:40.548
Now, there are also so many conditionings we have got,

00:02:40.668 --> 00:02:45.225
by which we judge others. And these conditionings, can also,

00:02:45.345 --> 00:02:50.109
bias our judgment. So best way is to see the vibrations.

00:02:50.229 --> 00:02:53.190
Through vibrations, you will have the real knowledge

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.150
about what is happening.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.626
Now many people, in the beginning, also start misguiding.

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.700
So best is to develop your vibrations.

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.312
For that you have to grow inward first of all.

00:03:05.432 --> 00:03:10.107
If you grow inward, deeply, then what will happen,

00:03:10.227 --> 00:03:15.640
that outward growth will be very solid, and would be exact.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.821
You won’t have any problems with that.

00:03:17.941 --> 00:03:19.694
But if you do not grow inward,

00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:22.760
if you do not meditate and pay attention to it,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.185
and, I would say, it is more the dedication that you have,

00:03:28.305 --> 00:03:33.096
that works out so well that you grow upwards so well.

00:03:33.216 --> 00:03:36.676
I mean you can give a speech whenever you want about Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:36.796 --> 00:03:39.462
you can give realization to people whenever you want,

00:03:39.582 --> 00:03:41.798
you can cure people whenever you want.

00:03:41.918 --> 00:03:44.323
But first, there should be a depth in you.

00:03:44.443 --> 00:03:46.127
If that you have not achieved,

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:48.682
you just start superficially doing something.

00:03:48.802 --> 00:03:52.318
Then maybe you are hit, or maybe you are in trouble,

00:03:52.438 --> 00:03:57.549
or maybe you may start doubting yourself, maybe Sahaja Yoga too.

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.756
So the first thing is for us to grow deeply.

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:05.703
And while we are growing deeply, we have to also grow

00:04:05.823 --> 00:04:10.939
in such a manner that we understand our vibrations clearly.

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:15.425
Now see a root, of a little plant,

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:20.186
has a got a very small little cell at the base of it.

00:04:20.306 --> 00:04:23.339
And the plant, doesn’t know anything,

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:25.934
as much as that little cell knows.

00:04:26.054 --> 00:04:31.424
Because it is going inside, by its own intelligence,

00:04:31.544 --> 00:04:33.067
its own vibrations.

00:04:33.187 --> 00:04:35.868
Now if it finds a stone, it doesn’t go and quarrel.

00:04:35.988 --> 00:04:39.092
So don’t fight with the people who are stonies.

00:04:39.212 --> 00:04:40.704
Just don’t argue with them.

00:04:40.824 --> 00:04:43.657
You cannot make them understand. It’s not possible.

00:04:43.777 --> 00:04:46.917
They have to be seekers and soft,

00:04:47.037 --> 00:04:49.833
like the soft clay you can say,

00:04:49.953 --> 00:04:56.315
through which this little cell goes, penetrates.

00:04:56.435 --> 00:05:00.169
Then it finds, supposing, it finds a big stone.

00:05:00.565 --> 00:05:02.777
Then what, it goes round and round and round.

00:05:02.897 --> 00:05:06.197
So gives it a bandhan nicely! And goes down.

00:05:06.317 --> 00:05:09.668
Later on when it becomes a tree, he uses the stone

00:05:09.788 --> 00:05:13.729
for its, you see, for its support.

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:14.896
So in the same way,

00:05:15.017 --> 00:05:18.038
you can go round and round and round somebody like that.

00:05:18.158 --> 00:05:20.950
But, giving just bandhan without saying anything.

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.224
In your heart. Not saying, arguing with him anything.

00:05:24.344 --> 00:05:27.247
Because you’ll break your head but he will never be alright.

00:05:27.367 --> 00:05:29.539
So best is not to argue with him.

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:31.646
But just give him bandhan in your heart

00:05:31.766 --> 00:05:34.765
and somehow or another bind it. So that later on,

00:05:34.885 --> 00:05:37.240
you see, he will become Sahaja Yogi,

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.915
but will be a big support to us.

00:05:39.035 --> 00:05:40.828
Because it’s just a stone you see.

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:45.619
Just now, use soft people, people who are easy people,

00:05:45.739 --> 00:05:50.848
people who are seekers, who are not so complicated.
