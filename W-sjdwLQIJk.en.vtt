00:01.754 --> 00:10.889
In Russia the people somehow are very
open-minded.

00:11.090 --> 00:15.082
Not only that, the scientists specially

00:15.283 --> 00:20.000
are very open-minded and were suppressed
very much,

00:20.201 --> 00:26.625
so they tried to find out the subtler
things;

00:26.826 --> 00:31.318
not only finding out about

00:31.886 --> 00:39.522
chemicals or about some physical properties
of the light,

00:39.723 --> 00:44.971
but they wanted to go into the subtler
side.

00:45.172 --> 00:53.758
And they had find, found out already
a great deal of knowledge

00:53.959 --> 00:58.700
about the auras – auras around the head,
auras around the body –

00:58.901 --> 01:01.823
they had done so much of research

01:02.024 --> 01:06.470
and was accepted all over the world,
their findings.

01:06.671 --> 01:09.791
Now this gentleman was a specialist,
I think,

01:09.992 --> 01:13.454
because he’s a very well-known, very,
very well-known person

01:13.654 --> 01:16.314
and he’s holding a very big position.

01:16.515 --> 01:21.240
He was saying that he was, he has to run
150 organizations –

01:21.441 --> 01:24.472
very humble and very nice person.

01:24.673 --> 01:31.280
And when he came out with this discovery
I was happy in a way,

01:31.481 --> 01:37.677
because scientifically if it is proved,
then nobody can challenge it.

01:37.878 --> 01:42.555
He has already written a book with
all the algebraical complications

01:42.756 --> 01:47.958
of what he wanted to prove. And he said
there is a vacuum,

01:48.159 --> 01:50.533
beyond the consciousness there’s vacuum,

01:50.734 --> 01:55.473
and in that vacuum only you can know
the reality.

01:55.675 --> 02:00.385
And once all this becomes the reality
it is a science,

02:00.586 --> 02:03.404
and that’s how it is made into science.

02:03.605 --> 02:06.374
He showed so many of My photographs,

02:06.574 --> 02:10.055
specially the one where lot of energy
is coming out

02:10.255 --> 02:13.333
of My Sahasrara when we are on a boat.

02:13.534 --> 02:17.959
So he said, “She is the Source of all
the cosmic energy.”

02:18.160 --> 02:24.935
And that’s what is Adi Shakti is:
She’s the one who creates everything.

02:25.445 --> 02:32.412
The whole atmosphere that we know of
is very artificial,

02:32.613 --> 02:40.029
but when you understand what She has done...
The first thing She does is to –

02:40.230 --> 02:44.867
in My book also I have written down
about it, but I would like to tell you –

02:45.068 --> 02:53.411
that Her first, should say, manifestation
is on the left-hand side.

02:53.612 --> 02:57.531
That’s the Mahakali’s manifestation.

02:57.732 --> 03:02.982
So She comes on the Mahakali system,
the left-hand side,

03:03.183 --> 03:07.670
and that is where She created Ganesha.

03:07.871 --> 03:15.033
Shri Ganesha is created because His purity,
His innocence

03:15.234 --> 03:22.337
and auspiciousness, this had to be created
before She created the universe.

03:22.538 --> 03:28.594
So first thing She does is to create
Shri Ganesha, and She settled down.

03:28.785 --> 03:32.324
Then She goes up, of course in the body
of the Virata,

03:32.531 --> 03:35.497
and then She goes round and goes up

03:35.698 --> 03:43.028
on the right-hand side in the other way;
and there She creates all the universes –

03:43.229 --> 03:50.353
as you call them, bhuvanas. One universe –
there are fourteen bhuvanas –

03:50.554 --> 03:56.240
means these many, many universes made,
make one bhuvana.

03:56.441 --> 04:01.357
And She creates all these things
on the right-hand side.

04:01.558 --> 04:05.988
Then She goes up and then She descends down,

04:06.189 --> 04:11.019
creating all the chakras, Adi Chakras
or the peethas.

04:11.220 --> 04:18.597
She comes down, makes all these peethas
and then She’s settled as the Kundalini.

04:18.798 --> 04:23.405
But Adi Shakti is not fully the Kundalini,
we can say –

04:23.606 --> 04:30.969
Kundalini is, is a part of it. The rest
of the work is much more than this.

04:31.170 --> 04:33.870
So the, all the, we call it the residual
energy – means

04:34.071 --> 04:38.276
after going through all this journey, then
She comes round

04:38.477 --> 04:45.380
and She goes as Kundalini. Because of this
Kundalini and the chakras,

04:45.581 --> 04:54.454
She creates a area which we call
as the chakras in the body.

04:54.655 --> 04:58.163
Now first She creates these chakras
in the head:

04:58.364 --> 05:02.362
we call them the peethas of the chakras.
And then She comes down

05:02.563 --> 05:09.502
and creates these chakras, which are
in the body of the Virata.

05:09.703 --> 05:14.635
Now once this has happened, then She
creates human beings,

05:14.836 --> 05:18.849
but not directly: through the evolutionary
process

05:19.050 --> 05:22.856
She goes through, and that’s how
the evolution starts.

05:23.057 --> 05:29.673
And then it starts developing from
the minute,

05:29.874 --> 05:38.024
small little microscopic organisms
in the water, and then it starts evolving.

05:38.225 --> 05:42.281
So when She creates water and She creates
all the universes,

05:42.482 --> 05:48.598
She chooses this Mother Earth as the best
place to play Her evolutionary process,

05:48.799 --> 05:53.134
and there She makes this little microscopic
thing.

05:53.335 --> 05:57.723
Of course I have written all about it, and
when My book will be released

05:57.924 --> 06:03.113
you can see that how first hydrogen, carbon

06:03.314 --> 06:08.906
and oxygen and all of these things were
mixed up and how nitrogen comes into play,

06:09.107 --> 06:12.218
and how a living process starts.

06:12.418 --> 06:14.629
All this I have done it in My another book

06:14.830 --> 06:17.899
that I am going to write now. I mean,
I have mostly finished,

06:18.100 --> 06:20.956
but there’s some more chakras are to be
dealt with.

06:21.157 --> 06:24.673
Now with this happening, you see,
one thing is there

06:24.874 --> 06:27.948
that whatever I write, now people
won’t doubt.

06:28.149 --> 06:33.835
They will know it’s a scientific fact, and
that’s what whatever I say is a fact.

06:34.036 --> 06:43.527
Now to believe in the car… in the, even,
a Mother, Adi Shakti, was impossible.

06:43.728 --> 06:46.955
Specially you’ll be amazed that Christian
religion

06:47.155 --> 06:50.520
somehow or other avoided the mentioning
of the Mother.

06:50.721 --> 06:55.975
Then the Islam, that also avoided
the mentioning of the Mother.

06:56.176 --> 06:59.649
There’s completely negation towards
the Mother.

06:59.856 --> 07:03.590
But only Indian philosophy had the Mother,

07:03.791 --> 07:07.205
and the Indians are actually
Shakti-worshippers.

07:07.406 --> 07:13.981
So this is how it was kept up and brought
to this position now,

07:14.182 --> 07:20.203
that people have got, people have got
full idea

07:20.404 --> 07:26.257
as to Mother Principle that has worked out
everything.

07:26.458 --> 07:29.387
On this Mother Principle in India people
are very sure

07:29.588 --> 07:35.194
that it’s the Mother who does everything,
and thus we have in India many,

07:35.395 --> 07:42.344
we should say, many swayambus, means things
that are created of the Mother Earth.

07:42.545 --> 07:47.636
For example, you know in Maharashtra
we have got Mahakali’s place,

07:47.837 --> 07:55.294
Mahasaraswati, Mahalakshmi, and also
we have got a place for the Adi Shakti.

07:55.495 --> 08:00.745
Some people who have been to Nasik must
have seen Chaturshringi.

08:00.946 --> 08:08.271
How many people have you been
to Chaturshringi, out of you? – it’s good.

08:08.557 --> 08:14.489
So this Chaturshringi represents
the Adi Shakti:

08:14.690 --> 08:18.879
Adi Shakti which is the fourth dimension

08:19.080 --> 08:25.255
of this Power, which gives you the ascent.

08:25.456 --> 08:31.136
And ultimately through Mahalakshmi channel
only, you get your realization.

08:31.337 --> 08:39.781
All this is a process, all was created
by the power of Adi Shakti.

08:39.982 --> 08:45.842
It’s a tremendous task. The previous ones
were not difficult,

08:46.043 --> 08:50.679
because there, for nature to create,
was very easy.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.699
The Mother Earth is one with
the Adi Shakti,

08:53.900 --> 08:56.782
the whole atmosphere is one
with the Adi Shakti,

08:56.983 --> 08:59.308
all the elements are one
with the Adi Shakti,

08:59.509 --> 09:02.884
so She could create all that without
any difficulties.

09:03.092 --> 09:08.452
But when human beings came, they got
their freedom.

09:08.653 --> 09:14.083
That’s the only, I should say, the species
which fell into the maya

09:14.284 --> 09:20.854
of thinking and of having the ego in them.

09:21.055 --> 09:25.175
With this ego a maya worked on them,
I should say,

09:25.376 --> 09:32.151
and they forgot about the Principle that
created this universe –

09:32.352 --> 09:37.213
they took it for granted. They felt that
this is their own right that they are there,

09:37.414 --> 09:42.576
this is their own achievement and they are
the owners of everything.

09:42.777 --> 09:47.795
This started working in their minds so much
that they invaded other countries,

09:47.995 --> 09:52.333
they destroyed so many people and they
never felt bad about it.

09:52.534 --> 09:55.835
All their lives they have been thinking
about aggressing others,

09:56.035 --> 10:00.007
controlling others and doing all kinds
of harmful things.

10:00.208 --> 10:06.666
But they never even thought or never did
any introspection to see

10:06.867 --> 10:11.870
that what we are doing is very, very wrong
and it should not be done.

10:12.071 --> 10:16.113
Because of the freedom they have, there’s
such a turmoil in this world.

10:16.314 --> 10:21.648
And the people who were in charge
of affairs, they were very, very cruel

10:21.849 --> 10:28.924
and extremely – had no feelings
for the other people.

10:29.125 --> 10:33.423
And this happened so many times in the,
on this earth.

10:33.624 --> 10:38.921
Now Sahaja Yoga has started. Once
Sahaja Yoga has started,

10:39.122 --> 10:46.914
we have Sahaja yogis who are now receiving
the blessings of the Adi Shakti directly.

10:47.115 --> 10:51.559
But still I must say, among Sahaja yogis
also we don’t have people

10:51.760 --> 10:57.290
whom I would call as very well-matured.

10:57.491 --> 11:01.723
They are Sahaja yogis, some of them,
are just because it’s a fashion;

11:01.924 --> 11:05.195
maybe it should be better from their angle,

11:05.395 --> 11:10.034
or from their selfish angle or whatever
it is. Is a very wrong thing.

11:10.234 --> 11:17.207
If you are in Sahaja Yoga you must know now
you are responsible for the whole world.

11:17.408 --> 11:20.901
You are the only people who have
come forward,

11:21.106 --> 11:24.388
you are the only people who have achieved
something.

11:24.589 --> 11:28.518
And then at this juncture you should behave
in a manner

11:28.719 --> 11:34.170
that, that behoves a big saint or
a realized soul;

11:34.370 --> 11:39.960
but sometimes you find them behaving
in such a manner, is shocking sometimes.

11:40.162 --> 11:43.941
They have no respect for themselves
or for others,

11:44.142 --> 11:47.106
and their whole attitude is very funny.

11:47.307 --> 11:51.138
Some of them are money-oriented, some
of them are power-oriented.

11:51.339 --> 11:56.026
And those who are power-oriented are more
dangerous, I think, than money-oriented;

11:56.227 --> 12:03.860
because those who are power-oriented try
to bring such bad name to Sahaja Yoga.

12:04.061 --> 12:08.532
They are very insulting, dominating and
horrible people.

12:08.733 --> 12:15.456
Their whole attitude is to achieve power
in Sahaja Yoga, and they try all tricks

12:15.657 --> 12:20.178
to achieve that power. But for some time
they, they look all right –

12:20.379 --> 12:25.645
after some time you’ll find they’ll all
disappear from the field of Sahaja Yoga.

12:25.876 --> 12:31.463
It’s a very big cleansing process going on.
You must understand that you have come

12:31.664 --> 12:41.789
in the, in the field of very high
consciousness

12:41.990 --> 12:45.579
where you are in contact with the Divine.

12:45.780 --> 12:49.892
Now here if you behave like ordinary people

12:50.093 --> 12:54.595
who have no divinity within them, how long
will you continue like this?

12:54.795 --> 13:01.588
So this is very important that you should
try to meditate and evolve yourselves,

13:01.789 --> 13:05.903
and become really very good Sahaja yogis.

13:06.104 --> 13:10.853
In some places we are very, very lucky.
In some, some countries we are

13:11.054 --> 13:14.137
very, very lucky. But in some countries
I find

13:14.338 --> 13:18.938
the people are just deaf and dumb.
They can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

13:19.139 --> 13:23.791
For My program they do come, and
afterwards just they disappear.

13:23.992 --> 13:29.419
This one I think is also – Sahaja yogis
are responsible for this.

13:29.620 --> 13:37.124
The way they go about, the way they want
to do Sahaj work is not Sahaj.

13:37.325 --> 13:41.724
Must be something definitely wrong with
the whole thing, and that’s why

13:41.925 --> 13:47.749
it’s not working out the same way as
it is working out in many places.

13:47.950 --> 13:53.882
So I have to tell you that all this is
there, that Adi Shakti is there,

13:54.083 --> 13:56.565
and all this has happened through
Adi Shakti.

13:56.766 --> 14:01.163
But now the further work has to be done
through you people

14:01.364 --> 14:06.887
because you are the channels, you are
the one who have to transform people.

14:07.088 --> 14:15.729
Now everybody should understand and know
how many people we have given realization.

14:15.930 --> 14:20.973
We have to think about it: what have
we done for Sahaja Yoga?

14:21.174 --> 14:24.539
Once I was traveling by plane and I saw
it was so –

14:24.740 --> 14:29.657
met a lady who was sitting next to Me,
and she was so hot, I couldn’t understand.

14:29.858 --> 14:32.927
Then she told me she is a disciple
of a guru

14:33.128 --> 14:37.215
and very proud of it, and she started
telling Me all about him and things.

14:37.416 --> 14:41.657
I was amazed, that look at this woman,
she hasn’t got anything from him

14:41.858 --> 14:44.437
and she was just saying, “I have given
so much money to him,

14:44.638 --> 14:47.224
I have done this thing to him,” and all
those things.

14:47.425 --> 14:51.955
But she had nothing, and despite that she
was talking to Me,

14:52.155 --> 14:54.771
a stranger person, about the guru.

14:54.989 --> 14:58.356
But in Sahaja Yoga I’ve seen people are
rather shy.

14:58.579 --> 15:02.074
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga
openly to others,

15:02.284 --> 15:07.826
which is a very wrong thing you are doing
because you are responsible for this work.

15:08.027 --> 15:12.578
You have been given realization – of course
you were seeking, everything is all right –

15:12.779 --> 15:17.187
but all of you must try to give
realizations to others.

15:17.387 --> 15:23.272
I must say that somehow men have been
more dynamic and working it out.

15:23.473 --> 15:28.332
The women in Sahaja Yoga are not yet
coming up to that level as they should.

15:28.533 --> 15:32.685
They have to be more sensible about it,
and they have to work it out.

15:32.885 --> 15:36.308
They can do it, but only trouble is,
I think they have

15:36.509 --> 15:40.966
certain minor problems about which
they are worried.

15:41.167 --> 15:44.564
Always I get letters from ladies saying
this is wrong,

15:44.765 --> 15:48.425
that is wrong, complaining all the time;

15:48.626 --> 15:50.960
when I’m so fed up of their letters now

15:51.161 --> 15:56.876
that I think they’re useless to read them
also. So I have to tell you all,

15:57.077 --> 16:01.964
that it is important that men, because
they are dynamic,

16:02.165 --> 16:08.284
women should be much more, because they are
shakti and I am a woman.

16:09.100 --> 16:14.287
So I find that the men are more sort of
active and dynamic

16:14.488 --> 16:18.886
about Sahaja Yoga, and I don’t know what is
the reason why women are not.

16:19.087 --> 16:24.425
They can transform so many people.

16:24.626 --> 16:31.376
They can do so much good to others. They
can bring so much love and compassion,

16:31.577 --> 16:37.788
because this love and compassion is
a quality of a mother, of a woman.

16:37.989 --> 16:42.832
And if the women don’t have that quality,
it’s useless to be a woman.

16:43.033 --> 16:48.559
All the time if you are busy about your
useless things

16:48.760 --> 16:54.184
like fashions or faces and all that, then
the time is all wasted.

16:54.385 --> 16:57.522
You have a short time now, you’ve got
your realization

16:57.723 --> 17:03.324
and you must decide what have you done
so far, what have you achieved for so far.

17:03.524 --> 17:07.176
But I would say that also in Sahaja Yoga
I’ve found

17:07.377 --> 17:13.733
there are all kinds of funny ideas growing
here. Like certain rituals they’ll take up.

17:13.934 --> 17:17.485
Then they prescribe certain rituals,
they’ll talk about it.

17:17.781 --> 17:23.003
And kind of a power-orientation is there.
They want to oppress others,

17:23.204 --> 17:26.553
and they want to take over and frighten
people

17:26.754 --> 17:32.785
and behave in such a manner that, as if
they are very good.

17:32.986 --> 17:38.776
Some of them start saying that “Mataji
said so. This is Mataji’s ideas.”

17:38.977 --> 17:46.650
By their own power-orientation they
manufacture things and talk like that and…

17:46.851 --> 17:50.281
But ask them, “How many have you given
realization?”

17:50.482 --> 17:54.284
The first thing is, you must determine
is positivity:

17:54.484 --> 17:56.786
how many you have given realization?

17:56.987 --> 18:02.156
Is just talking about others, criticizing
others, talking about

18:02.357 --> 18:07.075
the defects of Sahaja Yoga, seeing
in the Sahaj Yog;

18:07.276 --> 18:11.365
is I would say, is still a very preliminary
things

18:11.566 --> 18:15.775
that have happened before, and it should
stop.

18:15.976 --> 18:18.968
Now as it is, once this book is out,

18:19.169 --> 18:25.004
all over the world it will be known about
our work; we’ll be not challenged any more.

18:25.204 --> 18:33.225
But still we have to see for ourselves that
if we have achieved

18:33.426 --> 18:38.284
this kind of recognition then we should
be up to that,

18:38.484 --> 18:43.455
our capability should be up to that.
We should not be lagging behind.

18:43.656 --> 18:48.885
For example, if you ask some Sahaja yogis,

18:49.085 --> 18:52.735
specially Sahaja yoginis, they don’t know
much about Sahaja Yoga,

18:52.936 --> 18:57.461
they don’t know about chakras, they don’t
know anything about the deities;

18:57.662 --> 19:01.179
nothing they know – how can they be
Sahaja yogis?

19:01.380 --> 19:06.401
You have to know all about it. Only thing
that you don’t realize,

19:06.602 --> 19:12.390
that it’s not outside that you are a Sahaja
yogi but it is inside.

19:12.591 --> 19:18.367
Inside you have to have that kind
of an understanding of the chakras

19:18.568 --> 19:24.301
and of Sahaja Yoga, how it works,
how it helps you.

19:24.502 --> 19:31.254
Now supposing if I’m the Source of that
energy, which you know very well I am,

19:31.455 --> 19:37.478
then you achieve yours also, a kind
of a perfection about

19:37.679 --> 19:41.587
dealing with people and bringing them
to Sahaja Yoga.

19:41.788 --> 19:49.183
Is a very important work you have to do,
is to bring Sahaja yogis in Sahaja Yoga.

19:49.384 --> 19:54.506
What I find that some people are very much
still lagging behind,

19:54.707 --> 20:00.911
and it’s very surprising that they live
in that country,

20:01.112 --> 20:04.851
they are part and parcel of that country
and they are not bothered.

20:05.051 --> 20:09.426
Under these circumstances they’ll be
blamed, that “Why didn’t you do?

20:09.627 --> 20:17.245
Why didn’t you find out the ways and methods
of convincing at least your countrymen?”

20:17.446 --> 20:22.163
So Sahaja Yoga at the brink of growth

20:22.364 --> 20:25.205
cannot grow only with one country or two
countries;

20:25.405 --> 20:29.940
all the countries have to be brought
into Sahaja Yoga.

20:30.141 --> 20:38.361
All the people that we could call into
Sahaja Yoga will be a very good idea.

20:38.562 --> 20:44.211
And then we have books to convince people,
we have to talk to them about it.

20:44.412 --> 20:48.531
But what I find about Sahaja yogis,
that once they start

20:48.769 --> 20:51.760
spreading Sahaja Yoga also their ego
comes up,

20:51.961 --> 20:56.047
and this thing – they are very great Sahaja
yogis, they are great leaders –

20:56.248 --> 21:01.469
all this kind of stupid ideas walk into
their heads, which is wrong.

21:01.670 --> 21:04.987
You have to just think in a very humble
manner.

21:05.188 --> 21:08.365
The more you have, the more you become
humble,

21:08.565 --> 21:12.842
like a tree when laden with fruits,
bends down.

21:13.043 --> 21:16.442
In the same way you have to be very humble.

21:16.643 --> 21:20.708
But that humility is sometimes very
difficult,

21:20.909 --> 21:24.100
because the culture of the West is not
humble culture –

21:24.301 --> 21:31.791
it’s a culture of aggression, culture
of domination. So far they have been,

21:31.992 --> 21:35.955
they think because of domination they could
go all over the world,

21:36.156 --> 21:39.163
they could achieve so many things.
What have they achieved?

21:39.364 --> 21:43.868
Nothing. In their own countries if you see,
there’s drug addiction.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.363
Why should people take to drugs so much?

21:46.564 --> 21:50.987
Then all kinds of sinful things they do
which I don’t want to mention,

21:51.188 --> 21:56.445
but you know what they are doing – which
in India, which is a poorer country,

21:56.646 --> 22:00.855
one cannot even think of. Such things
are happening around you,

22:01.056 --> 22:03.365
so find out what’s wrong where

22:03.565 --> 22:08.310
and how you can correct these things,
if you can help them.

22:08.511 --> 22:13.591
Actually now, as I told you, I am going
to start some sort of organizations

22:13.792 --> 22:17.610
that will do good to human beings.
But you all can join also.

22:17.811 --> 22:21.742
You can also start in your own countries
something like that.

22:21.943 --> 22:26.985
But first you have to get rid of your ego.

22:27.186 --> 22:32.530
See, that once happens to you, then only
your attention would be steady.

22:32.731 --> 22:37.063
And this ego is very simple for you because
you worship Christ,

22:37.264 --> 22:42.390
and the Christ is the one who was settled
on the Agnya chakra.

22:42.591 --> 22:46.758
You all worship Christ, but that humility
of Christ is not there –

22:46.959 --> 22:50.220
just the opposite of it. It has happened
everywhere

22:50.421 --> 22:54.936
that whatever is preached in the religion,
people did just the opposite of it.

22:55.137 --> 22:58.442
For example Hindu religion, I would say
Hindu philosophy

22:58.643 --> 23:02.728
is that in everybody resides the spirit.

23:02.929 --> 23:06.424
Now in everybody if there is spirit,
then how can you have

23:06.625 --> 23:11.866
different caste systems, and how can you
have somebody higher and lower?

23:12.067 --> 23:16.708
Other way round, now Christ has said that
you have to forgive,

23:16.909 --> 23:20.005
forgive everyone, and you have to humble
down.

23:20.206 --> 23:23.855
And that’s what one finds, that among
Christians

23:24.056 --> 23:28.136
they don’t know humility, they have no idea
of humility.

23:28.356 --> 23:33.263
Men are like that, women are like that,
and the men and women then go on fighting.

23:33.464 --> 23:37.745
There’s no question of anybody being
humble, peaceful and all that.

23:37.945 --> 23:40.683
So it’s very artificially they are

23:40.884 --> 23:43.801
showing off that they are very
philanthropist and all that,

23:44.002 --> 23:47.798
but inside in their heart I don’t find
there is any love,

23:47.999 --> 23:51.152
there’s any compassion in the real sense
of the word.

23:51.353 --> 23:55.604
So when we are dealing with reality,
we have to know that we cannot just

23:55.805 --> 24:01.745
go on doing things which are artificial,
which are befooling others,

24:01.945 --> 24:06.213
but we have to really become that.
Once if you become that,

24:06.414 --> 24:11.503
when you are really like that, then only
you have done the job

24:11.704 --> 24:18.274
for which you are born at this juncture
of blossom-times.

24:18.475 --> 24:24.741
Otherwise you could have been born earlier
and could have been something different.

24:24.942 --> 24:28.304
But you are specially born so you realize
your value,

24:28.504 --> 24:33.124
realize yourself what you are and try
to understand,

24:33.324 --> 24:38.215
have a self-respect, and try to do things
which are very important

24:38.416 --> 24:44.119
as Sahaja yogis. Of course you are doing
a job, you are doing other things;

24:44.320 --> 24:47.494
but you’ll be amazed, if you do work
of Sahaja Yoga

24:47.695 --> 24:52.245
you will find more time for everything.
Once you start doing God’s work,

24:52.446 --> 24:55.587
God does your work. And that’s how
you’ll be amazed

24:55.788 --> 24:59.540
how you get so much time to do
the right thing.

24:59.741 --> 25:06.294
Now it is for you to go back and
introspect, see for yourself.

25:06.495 --> 25:09.368
Now the Adi Shakti Herself has come.

25:09.559 --> 25:13.054
But I’m very simple, I’m very simple
to look at;

25:13.254 --> 25:19.813
in My behavior I’m very, very humble,
and people take Me for granted.

25:20.014 --> 25:23.596
I don’t do anything. I don’t want to punish
you, I don’t want to do anything like that.

25:23.797 --> 25:27.529
But you yourself get punished, you yourself
become useless

25:27.730 --> 25:31.875
if you do not look after yourself
and grow yourself.

25:32.076 --> 25:37.614
This finding is so great, and this man
had never known Me before.

25:37.814 --> 25:43.569
He’s very learned but he’s very humble,
and what he told Me that,

25:43.770 --> 25:48.496
“Just imagine, I’m sitting before
the Creator of this world

25:48.697 --> 25:51.086
and still I’m very normal.”

25:51.287 --> 25:54.056
So I said, “What should happen to you,
what do you think?” So he said,

25:54.257 --> 25:58.139
“Mother, it’s a big thing to realize that
I am sitting before You,

25:58.340 --> 26:04.488
and that You are here.” I said, “It’s good
that you don’t feel My presence

26:04.689 --> 26:10.820
so oppressive or so dominating.
I’m very happy.”

26:11.021 --> 26:16.785
“No,” he says, “I just feel the love, just
feel the compassion". That’s what it is.

26:16.986 --> 26:21.330
We have to know that we should have
just love and compassion;

26:21.531 --> 26:24.604
compassion and love for ourselves

26:24.805 --> 26:28.766
in the way that we should not harm
anybody’s heart.

26:28.967 --> 26:33.907
To say something to hurt someone
is very sinful.

26:34.108 --> 26:38.262
But some people enjoy that very much, they
think they are very clever – it’s not so.

26:38.463 --> 26:45.585
When you talk to someone you must say
something which is very soothing and good.

26:45.786 --> 26:48.994
Another thing is the temper of a person,
is a temper –

26:49.195 --> 26:53.023
that a slightest thing here and there,
they get into tempers.

26:53.224 --> 26:56.924
Now this has to be told, this temper, that
“You keep quiet.

26:57.125 --> 26:59.776
I have nothing to do with you.”
That is one thing.

26:59.977 --> 27:07.443
Then there are people who are very subtly,
I should say, power-oriented, very subtle.

27:07.644 --> 27:11.629
They have tricks and trades by which
they know how to control others.

27:11.830 --> 27:14.537
What are you going to gain out of it?

27:14.738 --> 27:18.375
What is your gain? By doing all
these things what will happen?

27:18.576 --> 27:23.213
In these worldly things you might be
little bit popular,

27:23.414 --> 27:28.933
little bit having a position or something;
but what is it, after all?

27:29.134 --> 27:32.728
That is not going to help you. What is
going to help you the most

27:32.929 --> 27:38.850
is to make yourself a perfect channel
for Sahaja Yoga, to be a perfect channel.

27:39.051 --> 27:44.317
In that you will be amazed how you’ll
be helped.

27:44.518 --> 27:48.218
So I would say for you people who are
in the West, I would say

27:48.419 --> 27:51.814
you must develop humility. It’s very
important.

27:52.015 --> 27:55.857
I was surprised, in Russia itself
the people are not only humble,

27:56.058 --> 28:01.603
but such dedication, such dedication –
unbelievable!

28:01.804 --> 28:06.203
They don’t even raise their eyes to Me.
I don’t know how they got this idea.

28:06.404 --> 28:09.819
This is not after the discovery, but even
before that.

28:10.020 --> 28:16.697
They were so nice and so humble and
so full of love; and even the children

28:16.898 --> 28:21.836
brought Me small, small presents,
you know, just to give Me, so sweetly.

28:22.037 --> 28:25.836
This is something surprising how these
people in Russia

28:26.037 --> 28:29.713
have achieved that capability to become.

28:29.914 --> 28:34.019
And I think in the West, Russia is
the country

28:34.220 --> 28:38.135
which will achieve a very great height
in spirituality,

28:38.335 --> 28:41.289
and that means they’ll be the most powerful
people.

28:41.490 --> 28:44.237
Let us see what you are doing in your
own country

28:44.438 --> 28:46.573
and how you are going to work it out.

28:46.774 --> 28:50.455
See, there are so many things you can do
very easily,

28:50.655 --> 28:55.230
if you see for yourself that you are
the instrument of the Divine.

28:55.431 --> 29:00.021
And then your temperament will change,
the nature will change;

29:00.222 --> 29:05.918
you’ll become a very, very sweet person,
likable person,

29:06.119 --> 29:11.333
and everybody will think that this is
a saint walking around.

29:11.534 --> 29:15.689
So that’s all I have to say about this.
Whatever is the discovery

29:15.890 --> 29:19.552
is not a discovery for Me, but discovery
for the whole world.

29:19.753 --> 29:28.266
And I’m sure once it is established and
is exposed to the whole world,

29:28.467 --> 29:31.692
things will change for you, and for Me
also.

29:31.893 --> 29:34.990
May God bless you.
