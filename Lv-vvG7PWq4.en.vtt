00:00:03.279 --> 00:00:10.489
It is so great to be with you people
today on this auspicious day;

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:19.932
to be with Australians who have proved
to be very good Sahaja yogis

00:00:22.027 --> 00:00:29.256
and who have progressed in a very
speedy manner

00:00:33.756 --> 00:00:36.813
in their spiritual life.

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:45.588
It gives me greatest pleasure to be
with my children here.

00:00:55.721 --> 00:01:01.930
As you know I have so many children
all over the world

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.066
apart from the one whom I actually
physically gave birth.

00:01:10.292 --> 00:01:19.723
We have to think of all those today who
are away from us, thousands of miles,

00:01:24.324 --> 00:01:31.359
praying to God Almighty for their
spiritual ascent.

00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:37.211
One has to only pray for the spiritual
ascent.

00:01:37.412 --> 00:01:42.132
Because as you ascend you get all
the rest of it.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.791
Because you do not ascend you do not
get what is needed.

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:55.240
That’s why there are problems.

00:01:56.397 --> 00:02:02.201
And even today I had to solve some
problems before I could come to puja.

00:02:03.623 --> 00:02:10.018
But if you decide that we have to ascend
spiritually within us

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.710
then everything that you have to receive,

00:02:18.911 --> 00:02:23.475
all the blessings that God wants to shower
upon you,

00:02:23.676 --> 00:02:29.365
to make you the citizen of His great
Kingdom,

00:02:31.723 --> 00:02:35.577
where you are no more judged,

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.623
you are no more chastised,

00:02:45.597 --> 00:02:49.615
you are no more put to any test,

00:02:49.988 --> 00:03:01.201
of where you reside in eternal love
of God and in His glory.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.362
I could not believe about ten years back,

00:03:11.563 --> 00:03:19.656
that within ten years I’ll be able
to achieve this result.

00:03:22.444 --> 00:03:25.705
We should not judge the progress
of Sahaja Yoga

00:03:25.906 --> 00:03:31.773
in relation to other plastic gurus.

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:43.363
Even to create one saint will require
thousand lives to pass,

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:54.891
and so many have become prophets,
it is a very big thing for you.

00:03:55.092 --> 00:04:02.407
Let us forget about what dents we have
within ourselves.

00:04:05.617 --> 00:04:10.312
We have to know that we are prophets.
This assumption

00:04:12.325 --> 00:04:15.089
has to be established – that we are
prophets.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:22.436
If you could just assume what you are,
what you have become,

00:04:25.486 --> 00:04:30.564
you’ll emit the glory of God!

00:04:35.238 --> 00:04:42.619
Like a flower when it blossoms,

00:04:43.866 --> 00:04:49.670
it has its fragrance which flows
automatically,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:57.636
but it’s only human being who have
freedom even not to assume,

00:04:57.837 --> 00:05:03.095
to dramatise or to assume what they are.

00:05:06.756 --> 00:05:09.539
Even if they have become prophets

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.174
they still linger on with what they
are not, in imagination

00:05:15.375 --> 00:05:22.473
and are still frightened, are still
ego-oriented.

00:05:22.674 --> 00:05:27.116
Is falsehood. Is not your true nature.

00:05:28.118 --> 00:05:38.240
It’s like acting in a drama, becoming
the actor.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.512
Like somebody is acting like Shivaji,

00:05:52.046 --> 00:05:57.523
so he becomes as if he’s Shivaji.

00:05:57.724 --> 00:06:02.072
The whole lifestyle, everything changes –
he becomes like Shivaji.

00:06:02.273 --> 00:06:07.704
But the same person if he’s acting
like Hitler,

00:06:09.104 --> 00:06:13.815
he becomes like Hitler. Both are
artificial.

00:06:14.016 --> 00:06:18.200
But artificial they become.

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:21.521
Now when you are really prophets

00:06:21.722 --> 00:06:26.489
you find it difficult to be the real person
what you are,

00:06:26.698 --> 00:06:33.336
but artificial which has gone back,
which is no more there, all finished.

00:06:33.537 --> 00:06:42.259
The sinner is dead, the egoistical
is not there,

00:06:43.302 --> 00:06:50.044
the frightened one is gone forever,
you are a prophet.

00:06:50.245 --> 00:06:56.050
Rise in the glory of that personality.

00:07:00.986 --> 00:07:08.998
People who are not prophets, who are
not Godly,

00:07:09.199 --> 00:07:14.901
who are doing anti-God activities can
assume to be prophets.

00:07:15.102 --> 00:07:17.631
But those who are really prophets

00:07:17.832 --> 00:07:22.496
do not want to assume the situation –
that they are.

00:07:22.697 --> 00:07:26.607
As soon as you assume, you become that.

00:07:27.265 --> 00:07:36.093
We must today get over this kind of a play
our mind has been doing so far.

00:07:40.062 --> 00:07:43.617
All falsehood has to drop out.

00:07:49.982 --> 00:07:51.899
Of course as I said,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:57.686
I could never have dreamt that in ten
years, I’ll achieve these results,

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.527
with so many devils around us
to entice you.

00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:09.870
And credit (?) must go to you people also,

00:08:11.446 --> 00:08:21.713
that despite all hurdles and problems
you had, you have ascended,

00:08:24.595 --> 00:08:32.349
ascended so far, and have become
beautiful prophets.

00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:35.204
You are so transformed

00:08:35.405 --> 00:08:40.938
that little more – just to assume what
you are,

00:08:42.041 --> 00:08:46.278
will make you feel so sweet.

00:08:46.989 --> 00:08:51.728
I talked to my granddaughter, elder one,

00:08:51.942 --> 00:09:00.224
and she’s just a little girl, only 11 years
of age, but she told her mother:

00:09:00.425 --> 00:09:03.056
“Now I can’t talk to Nani (Grandmother)
because She’s a Goddess.

00:09:03.257 --> 00:09:08.401
How can I talk to Her! I feel shy.”
At that age!

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:19.477
While in her own life as they are saying
she’s topped in all the class,

00:09:19.678 --> 00:09:27.009
she’s got the, she’s the editor
in a magazine in her school.

00:09:27.864 --> 00:09:31.925
She’s tremendous. And she’s so humble
that she told her mother,

00:09:32.126 --> 00:09:34.303
“I feel shy to talk to Nani, She’s
a Goddess,

00:09:34.504 --> 00:09:37.416
how can I talk to Her?”

00:09:39.276 --> 00:09:45.153
And Rustom told Me that she, there are
vibrations emitting from her.

00:09:50.573 --> 00:09:53.442
That’s how you have to grow.

00:10:01.969 --> 00:10:06.486
First of all you have to know you are
prophets

00:10:06.687 --> 00:10:13.810
and you must know that I am the Holy Ghost.
I am the Adi Shakti.

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:20.137
I am the one who has come on this earth

00:10:20.384 --> 00:10:26.332
for the first time in this form to do
this tremendous task.

00:10:29.492 --> 00:10:33.493
The more you’ll understand this
the better it will be.

00:10:34.260 --> 00:10:39.036
You will change tremendously.

00:10:53.496 --> 00:10:59.698
I knew I’ll have to say that openly
one day and we have said it.

00:10:59.899 --> 00:11:06.462
But now it is you people who have
to prove it, that I’m that.

00:11:08.212 --> 00:11:15.611
Christ had disciples who were not even
realised souls

00:11:15.812 --> 00:11:19.587
and they have spread Christianity –
whatever it is.

00:11:19.788 --> 00:11:23.724
Under such circumstances that Christ
was crucified

00:11:23.925 --> 00:11:29.323
and they were left high and dry,
just twelve people struggling

00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:32.260
but they put it up.

00:11:38.438 --> 00:11:45.604
They were very humble people, their quality
was extremely humble

00:11:45.805 --> 00:11:52.749
and they knew the difference between
them and Christ and the Mother.

00:11:55.055 --> 00:12:02.101
Also they knew the difference between
them and the others

00:12:05.025 --> 00:12:15.114
and they took to lives which were pure,
illumined by the name of Christ.

00:12:15.315 --> 00:12:18.698
They were not realised souls.

00:12:22.302 --> 00:12:30.170
They cleansed themselves and kept
their lives beautiful.

00:12:32.284 --> 00:12:39.761
So Sahaja yogis can’t afford to have
these six enemies.

00:12:39.962 --> 00:12:44.367
First of all, the temper

00:12:46.824 --> 00:12:51.260
which really doesn’t behove.

00:12:51.461 --> 00:12:59.728
Compassion! Replace temper with compassion.

00:13:03.464 --> 00:13:08.989
Today is 60th birthday and we have
to just fight

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:15.058
only six enemies within ourselves.

00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:31.489
Second is which you have, most of you
have done,

00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:37.122
is to retract your attention
from perversion.

00:13:40.448 --> 00:13:46.838
Most of you have done it. Your eyes
are better now, steady.

00:13:53.077 --> 00:14:00.591
But still you are egoistical.

00:14:01.756 --> 00:14:03.976
Vanity.

00:14:13.259 --> 00:14:18.379
Still people are jealous, competitive.

00:14:25.753 --> 00:14:32.109
You still have some lurking materialism.

00:14:35.791 --> 00:14:41.618
A new thing that is coming, you are getting
attached to your families.

00:14:55.953 --> 00:15:09.155
So we have to change it now,
in a different use.

00:15:09.356 --> 00:15:15.403
Same thing can be used for doing
God’s work.

00:15:18.372 --> 00:15:24.060
They can be used as the six hands
of Sahaja yogis.

00:15:27.479 --> 00:15:36.682
The first one is the anger. You have to be
angry with yourself

00:15:36.892 --> 00:15:40.483
when you do wrong things. And not
to feel guilty

00:15:40.684 --> 00:15:45.069
but angry with yourself for doing
wrong things.

00:15:46.194 --> 00:15:51.359
Guilty is the best way never to get rid
of it.

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:57.421
It’s like a storehouse kept for personal
archives, locked up.

00:15:59.437 --> 00:16:04.403
I have suffered a lot because of your
guilty business very much.

00:16:07.792 --> 00:16:11.306
And they come out one by one.

00:16:12.402 --> 00:16:17.209
So you have to be angry with yourself
when you feel guilty:

00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:20.224
“How can I feel guilty? Why did I do
such a thing?

00:16:20.425 --> 00:16:23.368
I’m not going to do it.”

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:30.138
So develop your anger against yourself
and not against others.

00:16:33.221 --> 00:16:39.091
And anger could be reserved for the day
of war.

00:16:41.205 --> 00:16:44.833
Otherwise when the war will break out

00:16:45.034 --> 00:16:54.418
all the Arjunas will drop their weapons
and it will be said that,

00:16:54.619 --> 00:16:59.239
“Arjuna was a great warrior – till the war
started.”

00:17:03.184 --> 00:17:09.272
So we are not going to waste our energy
in warring with things

00:17:09.473 --> 00:17:16.377
which are just like shadows. Not to fight
the shadows.

00:17:23.065 --> 00:17:28.972
Sex, perversion, has to be diverted

00:17:29.173 --> 00:17:33.028
towards your family, your wife

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:36.943
and you have to respect your chastity now,

00:17:37.144 --> 00:17:42.361
the whole thing becomes nothing but
chastity, you lead a chaste life.

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:47.766
Not to be like a dog, but like to be like
a human being.

00:17:50.889 --> 00:17:55.400
All that attention has to become chastity
which is your power,

00:17:55.601 --> 00:18:01.494
which is your protection, which is your
connection with the Divine.

00:18:02.339 --> 00:18:05.165
Not forced chastity

00:18:06.948 --> 00:18:13.649
but a chastity of balance and
understanding.

00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:21.970
With your family, with your wife, in a very
chaste way you can live.

00:18:24.168 --> 00:18:28.528
Same with women – is more for women,
I would say.

00:18:28.729 --> 00:18:34.370
That they should not join hands with other
men who talk against your husbands,

00:18:35.957 --> 00:18:39.607
or who teach you against your husbands.

00:18:42.643 --> 00:18:46.463
All such men should be thrown out
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:18:46.664 --> 00:18:51.729
who try to tell women against their
husbands.

00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:54.675
This is a very sanctum sanctorum place

00:18:54.876 --> 00:18:59.706
where you should not interfere against
the husband.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:03.925
Nobody has a right.

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:15.595
If there is any problem you should let
me know.

00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:23.867
It’s a sign of stupidity.

00:19:34.077 --> 00:19:38.943
Then the vanity must be made into pride.

00:19:39.153 --> 00:19:43.221
You should be proud that you are
Sahaja yogis, really proud.

00:19:43.422 --> 00:19:48.934
Raise your heads with pride that we are
Sahaja yogis.

00:19:49.537 --> 00:19:54.931
Pride is never oppressive, it’s a glorious
thing to be proud.

00:19:55.132 --> 00:19:58.150
But vanity is.

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:05.697
Actually pride is nothing but
the expression of self-esteem.

00:20:06.742 --> 00:20:14.086
Begging, borrowing, mimicry, all these
things come

00:20:14.287 --> 00:20:22.971
from the less understanding of yourself.

00:20:23.529 --> 00:20:25.844
So vanity should be the pride,

00:20:26.045 --> 00:20:30.653
and the pride should be the expression
of self-esteem.

00:20:31.801 --> 00:20:34.783
Self esteem is very different from ego.

00:20:34.984 --> 00:20:40.287
One is reality, another is complete
artificiality.

00:20:41.778 --> 00:20:45.977
Men now should behave like men and not
like women,

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:51.803
docile, like cows to be tied with a rope

00:20:52.004 --> 00:20:56.042
whenever their women want them to.

00:21:03.434 --> 00:21:06.969
They have to lead the society.

00:21:13.071 --> 00:21:15.984
For the women’s rights in India, the women
never fought:

00:21:16.185 --> 00:21:20.031
is the men. They never fought;

00:21:20.232 --> 00:21:26.492
is the men, because men are also
the fathers, the brothers,

00:21:26.693 --> 00:21:30.676
and they are concerned about the well-being
of women.

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:35.769
Women seldom fought there because
they knew once they start politics

00:21:35.970 --> 00:21:38.835
of this fighting with men, there’s no end
to it.

00:21:39.036 --> 00:21:41.234
This is basically, they knew they have
to live with men,

00:21:41.435 --> 00:21:45.949
they can’t fight them. But men themselves
fought;

00:21:46.150 --> 00:21:48.291
even in America it was Abraham Lincoln
who fought

00:21:48.492 --> 00:21:54.034
for the liberation of women, not women.

00:22:03.235 --> 00:22:13.559
So you have to be not egoistical,
but proud.

00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.864
Proud that you are Sahaja yogis, proud that
you are born in such a time

00:22:18.065 --> 00:22:22.914
when you have to carry on the duties
of God’s work.

00:22:23.115 --> 00:22:30.746
That God has chosen you! So that you
should come up to that level.

00:22:31.111 --> 00:22:33.854
Like some people I find suddenly become

00:22:34.055 --> 00:22:37.169
morose recluses, in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:42.528
They will never be forgiven because God
has given you so much.

00:22:43.158 --> 00:22:46.097
Supposing somebody gives you a diamond.
You are proud,

00:22:46.298 --> 00:22:51.710
you put it on and show-off. But when you
have been given your Spirit

00:22:51.911 --> 00:22:55.836
you should be proud and not to behave
like recluses.

00:22:56.037 --> 00:23:00.467
Some people feel, “I should not take
any job now.

00:23:00.668 --> 00:23:03.141
I’ll not go out, I’ll sit at home and
meditate.”

00:23:03.323 --> 00:23:07.300
There’s no place for such people
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:08.410 --> 00:23:13.693
“I can’t do this.” The word “can’t”
should go away

00:23:13.894 --> 00:23:19.814
from the dictionary of people who are
supposed to be Sahaja yogis.

00:23:20.015 --> 00:23:23.436
You just can’t say, “I can’t do it.”

00:23:30.345 --> 00:23:34.352
So the self-esteem will give you

00:23:34.553 --> 00:23:37.235
that kind of a dynamism which is needed
for Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:37.436 --> 00:23:42.320
a discreet dynamism, a wise dynamism.

00:23:44.136 --> 00:23:48.039
I won’t have to solve your problems
any more.

00:23:52.384 --> 00:23:57.050
The quality of competition and jealousy

00:24:01.260 --> 00:24:03.986
should be brought round.

00:24:05.824 --> 00:24:08.420
There should be competition between
yourself,

00:24:08.621 --> 00:24:13.003
the one what you were and what you are.

00:24:14.276 --> 00:24:19.567
Who wins? Whether your past or present?

00:24:25.019 --> 00:24:28.529
Your present should go fast, faster
and faster,

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.827
leaving this past behind as much as
you can.

00:24:35.879 --> 00:24:41.477
There should be no competition between
Sahaja yogis in acquisition.

00:24:41.678 --> 00:24:46.255
Sometimes I have seen also competition
in shouting, screaming

00:24:46.456 --> 00:24:51.719
and being harsh to others – there’s
a big competition on.

00:24:53.322 --> 00:24:59.927
Let us have competition in compassion,
in mildness, in sweetness,

00:25:02.419 --> 00:25:08.801
in beautiful behaviour.

00:25:09.023 --> 00:25:15.407
Who is more cultured, who is more
gentlemanly, who is deeper;

00:25:15.608 --> 00:25:19.746
keep somebody an ideal before you
like that,

00:25:19.947 --> 00:25:28.257
whom you think is a very gentlemanly person
or a lady who is really like a lady.

00:25:30.061 --> 00:25:38.553
But on the contrary if you have a lady
who behaves like a man as your ideal,

00:25:38.754 --> 00:25:41.808
that is also not alright.

00:25:47.487 --> 00:25:52.977
Or a man who behaves like a woman,
that’s also not ideal.

00:25:53.178 --> 00:25:55.785
Or the other way round.

00:25:55.986 --> 00:25:59.309
A woman who tries to show that women
are different from men

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.011
and women must get this…

00:26:01.212 --> 00:26:04.049
In Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like
women and men,

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:06.366
that women must get this and men
must get that.

00:26:06.567 --> 00:26:10.761
Because you are Spirit. But the cover
that you have,

00:26:10.962 --> 00:26:15.732
the body that you have, the light you have,
the lamp that you have,

00:26:15.933 --> 00:26:19.479
is a different thing, and to keep
the light on,

00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:23.936
a woman has to be a woman and man
has to be a man.

00:26:24.182 --> 00:26:28.480
As yesterday I told you, that an apple
should not try

00:26:28.680 --> 00:26:32.826
to be a mango and mango should not try
to be an apple.

00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:43.312
It looks nice to be the best apple and
looks nice to be the best mango.

00:26:43.513 --> 00:26:47.639
So the recluses, those who say, that you
have to get out of it,

00:26:47.839 --> 00:26:51.515
behave really not like human beings
but I think like –

00:26:51.716 --> 00:26:56.411
I don’t know what animals do that way.

00:26:58.583 --> 00:27:04.297
Like when you get your doles you cannot
become indolent, you cannot.

00:27:04.498 --> 00:27:09.596
As far as possible I don’t like people
taking doles.

00:27:09.889 --> 00:27:11.878
Not a sign of good Sahaja yogis.

00:27:12.079 --> 00:27:14.436
You all should be hard working, you must
have qualifications,

00:27:14.637 --> 00:27:19.360
you should be good people on top
of everything.

00:27:20.284 --> 00:27:27.430
Good students, good cooks, good mothers,
good fathers,

00:27:27.631 --> 00:27:33.140
good administrators – from where are we
going to get these people?

00:27:35.657 --> 00:27:39.345
We cannot be dishwashers, can we?

00:27:45.898 --> 00:27:50.339
So the competition between women and men
must be stopped.

00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.500
Women must have their own place and men
must have their own place.

00:27:53.701 --> 00:27:57.361
And women must know that men are
their hands.

00:27:57.562 --> 00:27:59.696
If you are the shakti, they are
the machines

00:27:59.897 --> 00:28:01.995
and don’t kill your machines by shouting
at them,

00:28:02.196 --> 00:28:07.870
by screaming at them and by putting them
down, making them diffident.

00:28:08.071 --> 00:28:11.021
We’ll have no place.

00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:22.147
We have to encourage them to do God’s work.

00:28:22.348 --> 00:28:25.590
You have to support them, look after them,
because they are the machines,

00:28:25.791 --> 00:28:31.333
they are the hands and you are the power.

00:28:39.429 --> 00:28:47.478
Of course if these hands go against
the power they will suffer.

00:28:50.620 --> 00:28:54.149
So there should be no competition between
children and you –

00:28:54.350 --> 00:28:58.109
my child, and his child, there should be
not such competition,

00:28:58.310 --> 00:29:02.467
take out your mind from there. There should
be complete sharing.

00:29:02.668 --> 00:29:05.497
So the competition should end in sharing.

00:29:05.698 --> 00:29:10.459
How much we share? How much can we share?

00:29:11.511 --> 00:29:18.574
See drunkards can’t sit and drink alone.
They have to have some people to share.

00:29:20.474 --> 00:29:24.469
The thieves must have ten people to thieve.

00:29:26.860 --> 00:29:30.438
But when it comes to the nectar
of God’s love

00:29:30.639 --> 00:29:36.745
how can we alone have it? Cannot enjoy.
There’s no enjoyment at all in it.

00:29:36.946 --> 00:29:41.454
So let us be gentle and kind with
each other.

00:29:48.953 --> 00:29:53.412
The people who are going to enjoy
the nectar

00:29:54.375 --> 00:29:57.513
should have competition in sharing
that nectar

00:29:57.723 --> 00:30:01.463
by which they get more and more of that.

00:30:01.664 --> 00:30:06.178
Who shares more? Who is more generous?

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:15.658
Materialism should be taken to its beauty.

00:30:19.131 --> 00:30:23.070
You can have one thing done with your hand.

00:30:25.865 --> 00:30:31.825
That’s much more beautiful than running
after money, counting money,

00:30:32.026 --> 00:30:36.299
you’ll become crackpots really.

00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:41.600
Those who count their money morning
till evening are real crackpots.

00:30:41.801 --> 00:30:46.885
They always lose money, there’s something
wrong with their brains.

00:30:48.273 --> 00:30:51.322
Count your blessings.

00:30:57.536 --> 00:31:04.402
See life, the beauty in matter.
How life has worked.

00:31:04.603 --> 00:31:11.221
See a wood, I see, I see the pattern
it has created on that, the life.

00:31:11.422 --> 00:31:22.403
But it’s not morose, it’s not dead,
it’s not insipid, it’s bubbling.

00:31:27.678 --> 00:31:33.196
You can see in art, you can see in all
that is beautiful,

00:31:33.397 --> 00:31:38.058
the reflection of God’s creative power

00:31:38.259 --> 00:31:41.151
and the joy that He wanted to emit
for your happiness.

00:31:41.352 --> 00:31:43.022
While you become slaves of matter.

00:31:43.223 --> 00:31:47.795
He never wanted you to do that.
You are the masters.

00:31:50.161 --> 00:31:55.685
Last of all is the attachment to your
children,

00:31:56.541 --> 00:32:01.361
to your wife, your, your, your…

00:32:01.562 --> 00:32:09.813
Whatever is mine is not ‘I’. My house,
that’s not ‘I’.

00:32:10.290 --> 00:32:16.603
My this, my, my, my, must be given up,
‘Mamatva’ is to be destroyed.

00:32:18.308 --> 00:32:23.480
Instead of that, you should say ‘we’.
‘We’ is a good word.

00:32:23.681 --> 00:32:28.910
I so many times say ‘we’. And then people
start wondering...

00:32:29.111 --> 00:32:34.096
One day, somebody asked me, “Mother,
when you say ‘we’, what do you mean?

00:32:34.297 --> 00:32:41.220
How can you make us feel that way, that we
are all one, the way you say ‘we’?”

00:32:41.421 --> 00:32:47.780
I said, “Why not? You are part and parcel
of My body. Aren’t we ‘we’?”

00:32:47.981 --> 00:32:53.095
Do I separate My finger from My heart?

00:32:54.385 --> 00:33:00.241
If you are part and parcel of My body
then I have to talk like ‘we’

00:33:00.442 --> 00:33:05.854
because I’m conscious of this collective
being sitting here.

00:33:07.403 --> 00:33:14.093
So we have to talk like ‘we’ and not
‘I, my’.

00:33:16.477 --> 00:33:22.919
And when you have to address about yourself
speak it in a third person.

00:33:23.677 --> 00:33:30.348
Like you can say: “This Nirmala is now
going to London.”

00:33:30.549 --> 00:33:37.640
Really, is true, because this body’s going
there but My heart is going to remain here.

00:33:40.211 --> 00:33:48.827
So to say that I am going is not true –
if I am Adi Shakti where am I going?

00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:53.233
I’m going nowhere, I’m everywhere.
Where can I go?

00:33:53.434 --> 00:33:58.290
There’s no place where I don’t reside
and if I have to go to such a place,

00:33:58.491 --> 00:34:02.555
it’s Hell only where I don’t want to go.

00:34:06.376 --> 00:34:13.089
So, what I say that, “This Nirmala
is going now.

00:34:14.528 --> 00:34:20.443
Leaving Australia.” Tomorrow I’ll be
leaving.

00:34:20.644 --> 00:34:24.231
So what happens?

00:34:26.404 --> 00:34:33.298
Just this body has to move – that’s all.

00:34:33.499 --> 00:34:40.247
Like that, you start saying about your
body.

00:34:40.448 --> 00:34:45.425
“This mind of mine, this mind of Mr.
So and So.”

00:34:45.626 --> 00:34:50.499
Is better to address yourself as Mr.
or Mrs. or Miss.

00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:55.681
“So Miss, will you please get up now?”
Better address yourself.

00:34:55.882 --> 00:35:00.903
Children talk like that. Like a third
person.

00:35:01.104 --> 00:35:08.098
You’ll be amazed, you will see the joke
behind the whole thing.

00:35:08.299 --> 00:35:10.480
You’ll know how to laugh at yourself.

00:35:10.681 --> 00:35:16.167
“Oh so Mr., come along, now he’s behaving
like this.”

00:35:17.605 --> 00:35:20.116
And you’ll really become a master
of yourself,

00:35:20.317 --> 00:35:24.357
because you know how to handle this baby.

00:35:31.667 --> 00:35:35.540
It will give you that sense of maturity.

00:35:40.759 --> 00:35:44.316
So to say, “This is my child, this is
my wife”;

00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:46.861
of course, you have to look after your wife
and your children

00:35:47.062 --> 00:35:50.808
because they’re your responsibility

00:35:51.009 --> 00:35:56.494
but do for other children more than you
would like to do for your own child.

00:35:57.467 --> 00:36:00.658
(There is somebody who has come.)

00:36:24.361 --> 00:36:32.460
So this complete identification with your
children, over protectiveness,

00:36:32.661 --> 00:36:36.419
will give you trouble. You have to believe

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:46.128
that your family is the family of your
Father,

00:36:47.863 --> 00:36:51.496
and your Mother is looking after it.

00:36:51.697 --> 00:36:57.163
If you think you can look after your family
by yourself – go ahead!

00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:05.624
So don’t be overprotective, don’t be too
worried, too upset about your family.

00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:13.757
And keep a very sociable temperament

00:37:13.958 --> 00:37:18.465
so that your children also don’t become
like you.

00:37:18.666 --> 00:37:21.498
Tell them how to share.

00:37:23.250 --> 00:37:27.688
If one child has fallen off ask other
children to help.

00:37:27.889 --> 00:37:30.626
Form plays in which you should show,

00:37:30.827 --> 00:37:35.298
how a child who is coming, who cannot
walk properly,

00:37:35.499 --> 00:37:40.911
how other children go and try and find out
methods how to help him to come out.

00:37:41.102 --> 00:37:47.703
Teach them, through dramas, through
stories, through various things,

00:37:47.904 --> 00:37:51.331
what is goodness.

00:37:52.256 --> 00:37:55.503
You must help even without the idea
of help.

00:37:55.704 --> 00:38:04.439
It’s a pleasure, it’s a privilege.
It’s a great honour that you can do it.

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:08.778
We must change our ideas completely.

00:38:09.103 --> 00:38:11.520
Many people have a habit to serve
‘your’ child first –

00:38:11.721 --> 00:38:17.652
is absolutely very vulgar, shows bad
breeding.

00:38:17.947 --> 00:38:22.577
Must serve others first, and then your
own family.

00:38:25.052 --> 00:38:29.659
Keeping something back for your children,
hiding some food for your children –

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:35.875
is all a sign of a person who is like
a ‘kupamanduka’,

00:38:36.076 --> 00:38:42.296
means ‘a frog who lives in a small well’.

00:38:44.335 --> 00:38:46.651
Get over it.

00:38:48.807 --> 00:38:53.689
Try, men to form your own group of men

00:38:53.890 --> 00:38:57.818
and women should form their group of women.

00:38:58.019 --> 00:39:06.569
There should be no instruction to women
from men too much. Is not proper.

00:39:07.201 --> 00:39:10.839
I have discovered so many funny things,

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:16.228
I can’t understand, how these things
work out.

00:39:16.429 --> 00:39:22.738
But, it is because one side you feel your
family is too much,

00:39:22.939 --> 00:39:29.782
your husband is too much, you must be
absolutely secluded from all the rest,

00:39:29.983 --> 00:39:34.000
or on the other side it is that you give up
your husband completely -

00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:38.362
he is no good, the marriage is
unsuccessful, stick on to something else

00:39:38.563 --> 00:39:44.212
which is supposed to be a something,
higher goal of destruction.

00:39:44.747 --> 00:39:48.381
So both things are not good.

00:39:50.336 --> 00:39:57.545
You must stand for your husband or wife
or for your children, when it is right.

00:39:57.746 --> 00:40:01.108
But obviously you should not do it,
apparently you should not do it.

00:40:01.309 --> 00:40:03.552
You should tell your child, “Alright,
I understand,

00:40:03.753 --> 00:40:07.594
but I don’t want to do it in the public.”

00:40:08.696 --> 00:40:11.883
People should not also know that he’s
your child.

00:40:12.084 --> 00:40:15.220
The way he mixes up with others, stays
with others,

00:40:15.421 --> 00:40:19.727
shares with others, that’s how a Sahaja
yogi should be.

00:40:23.357 --> 00:40:24.958
You know as for myself,

00:40:25.159 --> 00:40:30.460
I’ve not even given realisation
to my children so far.

00:40:31.767 --> 00:40:38.737
Can you believe it? Leave alone the
knowledge of Kundalini. You can teach them.

00:40:39.857 --> 00:40:43.791
I know I can give them any time I want to.

00:40:47.942 --> 00:40:52.104
I have not given them time at all,
no time to them.

00:40:52.305 --> 00:40:58.097
If you see, how much time do I spend with
My own daughters? Very little time.

00:40:58.298 --> 00:41:04.162
In the whole year, this year I was there
for three days with her.

00:41:06.648 --> 00:41:09.789
So the relationship at this time is
the most important,

00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:13.837
is of Sahaja Yoga and Sahaja yogis.

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:17.436
I have seen some Sahaja yogis write
to their parents, to their mothers,

00:41:17.637 --> 00:41:22.959
to their brothers, much more than they
write to the other Sahaja yogis.

00:41:23.481 --> 00:41:26.424
Is very amazing.

00:41:27.769 --> 00:41:32.739
To their fathers but not to other
Sahaja yogis.

00:41:33.755 --> 00:41:35.554
You must start writing to other
Sahaja yogis.

00:41:35.755 --> 00:41:38.840
Those who have lived in London,
how many of them

00:41:39.041 --> 00:41:41.913
are writing to people in London? Have
they made any friends or anything? –

00:41:42.114 --> 00:41:46.312
Nothing of the kind. They are so busy
with their own problems,

00:41:46.513 --> 00:41:55.085
they’re not bothered, to create that
bondage of love.

00:41:57.479 --> 00:42:00.812
As if they have no interest in Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:01.013 --> 00:42:07.258
They stayed in the ashram, in London. How
many of you are writing letters to them?

00:42:07.488 --> 00:42:10.549
To London people. How many letters
do you write?

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.239
Now you have met them in this programme,

00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:17.008
how many of you are writing letters
to them and keep in contact?

00:42:17.209 --> 00:42:21.383
How much does it take to write a letter?
Nothing.

00:42:24.802 --> 00:42:28.270
I hope as soon as you go back today you
all should write letters

00:42:28.471 --> 00:42:33.167
about today’s Birthday – how it was
celebrated, in a beautiful way.

00:42:33.368 --> 00:42:40.123
Not to your family, not to your people,
but to others.

00:42:40.324 --> 00:42:43.428
All of them are all over, you know how
they are.

00:42:43.629 --> 00:42:47.106
You write to them because you know
they are the heads of the thing.

00:42:47.307 --> 00:42:54.114
Like if you write to Gregoire or you can
write to Ruth in Italy,

00:42:54.315 --> 00:43:00.638
you can write to Genevieve in Geneva.

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:05.046
You have met all of them – you should
write!

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:10.716
Ladies must write to ladies and men must
write to men.

00:43:10.917 --> 00:43:14.869
Arneau is in Lausanne: why not write
to him?

00:43:15.070 --> 00:43:20.459
He’s there; now do you know that his wife
has to go to America for a delivery?

00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:22.819
We should know about each other,
very intimately.

00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:28.851
About how many people I know so many
things, all the details.

00:43:34.369 --> 00:43:39.238
That’s how; you must flood yourself
with that love.

00:43:39.439 --> 00:43:44.359
Tomorrow you go to America or to any
one of these places,

00:43:44.560 --> 00:43:49.127
you have there your brothers and sisters
already established.

00:43:49.755 --> 00:43:53.639
Write to them about your Mother,
what you think.

00:43:55.033 --> 00:44:00.249
You only write to Me sometimes but never
to each other.

00:44:02.308 --> 00:44:07.543
Don’t write too big letters to Me
especially.

00:44:10.312 --> 00:44:14.559
But write nice, sweet letters, poetic
letters,

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:18.650
they’ll feel happy, it’s like sending
flowers.

00:44:20.478 --> 00:44:25.873
Taking ideas from there it will be
a very good idea.

00:44:26.074 --> 00:44:28.517
(What’s the matter?)

00:44:41.351 --> 00:44:48.917
This will overcome these six enemies
and make them your slaves

00:44:49.118 --> 00:44:53.029
and use them for your purpose.

00:44:53.404 --> 00:44:59.525
Then they’ll become great things.
Then they’ll be your assistants,

00:45:01.173 --> 00:45:12.397
then they wlll be your commanders of your
army, they’ll be your decorations.

00:45:14.285 --> 00:45:19.387
It is all in your hands. With wisdom,
you have to do it.

00:45:21.246 --> 00:45:27.120
At this time, at the age where I’ve
reached –

00:45:31.715 --> 00:45:35.923
I was always there, same age,

00:45:36.991 --> 00:45:41.731
I’ve been always mature like this,
child like this,

00:45:42.788 --> 00:45:48.797
just like a young girl and an old woman,
all put together,

00:45:48.998 --> 00:45:52.330
every year, every time.

00:45:52.706 --> 00:45:57.017
But I’ve definitely matured in understanding
human beings.

00:46:00.571 --> 00:46:03.709
I’ve definitely got better understanding
and maturity

00:46:03.910 --> 00:46:08.252
as far as My knowledge about human beings
are concerned because they are...

00:46:08.453 --> 00:46:11.273
When I was born they were strangers
to Me – just strangers.

00:46:11.474 --> 00:46:15.318
Imagine that Adi Shakti should say this,
but it’s true!

00:46:15.519 --> 00:46:23.210
Despite I have created you, I was
absolutely a stranger.

00:46:27.130 --> 00:46:31.910
But now, I’ve grown, I’ve understood you
very well,

00:46:34.209 --> 00:46:40.595
I know you are My children, I know how much
you love Me

00:46:41.226 --> 00:46:43.819
and how much you are close to Me.

00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.616
[Shri Mataji: Why is he crying so much?
Yogi: He wants to go to the toilet, Mother.

00:46:47.817 --> 00:46:50.614
Shri Mataji: Let him take away.
Yogi: He wants me to go with him

00:46:50.815 --> 00:46:54.129
but I’m trying to say he can go himself,
but...

00:46:54.350 --> 00:46:56.091
Shri Mataji: Let him go, this is the thing,
you see,

00:46:56.292 --> 00:46:58.095
these children are very obstinate,
I personally think.

00:46:58.296 --> 00:47:00.889
Yogi: Yeah. He wants me to go with him.
That’s the thing, that’s why.

00:47:01.090 --> 00:47:02.731
Shri Mataji: That’s it. That’s bhootish,
isn’t it?

00:47:02.932 --> 00:47:05.684
Yogi: Yes, that’s what I’m saying.
Shri Mataji: We can think - let him go.

00:47:05.885 --> 00:47:08.756
He won’t listen.

00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:13.421
Better go. See.

00:47:18.156 --> 00:47:20.066
All right, take him down.

00:47:20.267 --> 00:47:24.951
What to do, you see, they are very
obstinate. They are bhoots.

00:47:25.168 --> 00:47:29.002
Such a big boy can’t go to the toilet?
Yogi: Yes...

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:39.149
Shri Mataji: Just to disturb him,
that’s all.

00:47:42.870 --> 00:47:45.544
May God bless you.

00:47:47.807 --> 00:47:49.315
You must really slap him now,

00:47:49.516 --> 00:47:52.899
if you give two slaps now, his bhoot
will go away.

00:47:53.099 --> 00:47:55.198
Two slaps are needed. Next time
he won’t do it.

00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:57.580
You see at this time you must slap,

00:47:57.781 --> 00:48:02.124
not very hard but let him know that
you don’t like it.

00:48:05.924 --> 00:48:08.408
Bhoots can sometimes can go away
only with slapping.

00:48:08.609 --> 00:48:11.528
I have seen especially with children
it happens.

00:48:11.729 --> 00:48:14.617
Two slaps on the face and they’re alright.

00:48:14.818 --> 00:48:18.570
Because they’re bhoots, you see, and they
have to go away.]

00:48:20.377 --> 00:48:25.091
Now whatever I have said to you yesterday
for children be careful.

00:48:25.292 --> 00:48:32.611
You have to make your children assets
and not liabilities, on Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:39.348 --> 00:48:41.952
So try to train them up properly.

00:48:42.153 --> 00:48:47.615
Bring them up, they deserve a good hand,
to handle.

00:48:48.032 --> 00:48:52.315
In the beginning you have to be very strict
and punish them if they do anything wrong,

00:48:52.516 --> 00:48:56.142
so they know what is right, what is wrong.

00:48:58.471 --> 00:49:03.301
And once they grow up you’ll be amazed
what an asset they are.

00:49:06.657 --> 00:49:10.060
Some of them are very good children

00:49:10.524 --> 00:49:13.881
but if the influence of the bad children
comes up too much,

00:49:14.082 --> 00:49:17.309
they might spoil the good children also.

00:49:17.510 --> 00:49:24.106
So better encourage children, who are good,
who have been very sweet.

00:49:26.336 --> 00:49:34.470
So I think of My young age, of My childhood

00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:38.669
and the dream, how it has come true.

00:49:42.346 --> 00:49:47.664
Whatever I have dreamt, is beyond
my imagination.

00:49:50.298 --> 00:49:57.533
It’s done now, as far as I’m concerned
you don’t need Me much, any more.

00:49:57.827 --> 00:50:02.150
I’ve told you whatever was needed
for your counselling.

00:50:02.350 --> 00:50:09.313
I have taught you the methods how to redeem
others, and comfort them.

00:50:09.514 --> 00:50:15.407
You know everything. Now just become
masters in this art.

00:50:16.585 --> 00:50:24.395
Forgetting your past. You are all great
people, all of you.

00:50:24.913 --> 00:50:31.909
So, even next year, I should see you

00:50:32.110 --> 00:50:39.251
sitting on this seat, not in My lap.

00:50:42.042 --> 00:50:47.697
On your own, teaching your children.

00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:53.945
Let the second generation start now.
The first generation is ready,

00:50:54.153 --> 00:50:56.797
now the second generation has to come
and you have to look after

00:50:56.998 --> 00:51:00.019
the second generation.

00:51:00.744 --> 00:51:08.155
I want to be a real grandmother of very
grand children,

00:51:13.362 --> 00:51:18.531
that’s a special privilege and real
promotion and maturity.

00:51:21.055 --> 00:51:23.725
Look at this (rain is pouring down).

00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:27.931
He’s going to flood your Parramatta
(river in Sydney).

00:51:29.719 --> 00:51:34.412
Because I have said now I’m the Holy Ghost,

00:51:37.669 --> 00:51:42.549
everybody seems to be over-happy and
joyous.

00:51:48.325 --> 00:51:53.304
So thank you very much, for having Me here

00:51:53.505 --> 00:51:58.668
and think of all the Sahaja yogis all
around the world, all of them.

00:51:58.869 --> 00:52:02.776
Today, I think we should send some
telegrams, about twelve telegrams

00:52:02.977 --> 00:52:07.960
if possible, to all the centres, saying

00:52:08.161 --> 00:52:13.499
60th Birthday of Mother was celebrated
with great joy.

00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:18.593
She sends blessings, or something.
They’ll be very happy.

00:52:21.519 --> 00:52:26.098
But according to Indian method it is 61st

00:52:26.299 --> 00:52:30.356
because the day I was born, that was also
a birthday.

00:52:30.557 --> 00:52:34.839
That was a real birthday. So they
call it 61,

00:52:35.040 --> 00:52:39.511
and we are going to have a big programme
in India also.

00:52:40.638 --> 00:52:46.592
You are specially favoured people,

00:52:46.793 --> 00:52:50.303
and I hope you’ll favour Me specially too.

00:52:50.488 --> 00:52:55.923
This year I hope, all of you are going
to take up a new role

00:52:56.124 --> 00:53:01.010
and a new style of life where you become
mild people,

00:53:01.336 --> 00:53:07.914
not docile men but mild people and docile
women.

00:53:13.135 --> 00:53:20.682
Women have to be more docile, domesticated.

00:53:21.227 --> 00:53:23.748
They’ll look nice.

00:53:24.502 --> 00:53:32.376
They’ll become gentle, they’ll smile
better, they(’ll) create such joy.

00:53:33.215 --> 00:53:38.856
We are here to create joy and not to enjoy
some rights, which are artificial,

00:53:39.057 --> 00:53:43.056
to create joy. How much joy do we create?

00:53:43.819 --> 00:53:51.969
How much joy do we give to others?
So today on this great occasion,

00:53:53.092 --> 00:53:58.998
we have to feel our joy, within our heart.

00:53:59.199 --> 00:54:05.187
Very deep down within us lies that source
of joy.

00:54:05.388 --> 00:54:08.793
So we have to go deep down within ourselves

00:54:08.994 --> 00:54:15.698
and feel the joy of this sixty-year old
Mother of yours, that I have within Myself.

00:54:15.906 --> 00:54:21.427
Go deep down, it’s there, enjoy it and then
give it to others.

00:54:21.628 --> 00:54:25.010
Like a fountain of joy you should give.

00:54:26.637 --> 00:54:29.039
May God bless you.
