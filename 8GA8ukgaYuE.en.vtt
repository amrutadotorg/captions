00:00:08.325 --> 00:00:11.689
Today is a New Year day. So I am telling
them

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:16.128
they have to decide now, Indians, that if
the children are born realized

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:21.734
you should not put any sort of pressure
on them

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:30.632
of your culture, I don’t agree there.

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:37.161
The culture of love is the culture
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:43.643
Of course, Indian culture is very
deep-rooted, very beautiful, everything,

00:00:43.844 --> 00:00:52.774
but the, I think the, to the trees of this
great culture,

00:00:52.975 --> 00:01:00.314
you have to give that some nourishment,
some water of love.

00:01:00.515 --> 00:01:04.888
Unless and until you use that, they will
not grow.

00:01:08.904 --> 00:01:18.675
So that is how we can take and give
something nice from each other.

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:36.983
I will be very happy to see that all those
children who are born realized,

00:01:37.184 --> 00:01:42.141
grow to be the saints of this country

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:45.919
and the same with the western people.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.498
They should also respect their children,
love them,

00:01:50.699 --> 00:01:54.447
give them all the freedom that is needed
for their growth,

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:58.332
instead of cutting all the time.

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:03.067
If you go on cutting the trees, they will
never grow

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.828
and they are on the natural grounds
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:09.377 --> 00:02:15.191
So this culture, Indian culture which is
very great, I must say,

00:02:15.392 --> 00:02:22.741
but there is one thing which is missing
in it is the water of love.

00:02:22.942 --> 00:02:29.698
Even the Gurus you see, oh my God, I have
heard about them

00:02:29.914 --> 00:02:33.503
that the way they used to treat their
disciples,

00:02:33.713 --> 00:02:38.039
I've said, “Let these Gurus go to hell,
who cares.”

00:02:38.248 --> 00:02:40.400
And those who would not trouble

00:02:40.601 --> 00:02:44.754
would be satisfied if you give them some
money.

00:02:45.787 --> 00:02:47.642
With money they are satisfied,

00:02:47.843 --> 00:02:50.210
but they would not hit you, they wouldn’t
do anything.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.583
There are only two types of Gurus.

00:02:52.784 --> 00:02:56.723
One who would take money, exploit

00:02:56.924 --> 00:03:04.878
and the others who would treat them
just like, I don’t know what.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.232
Sahaja Yoga is in the centre. It is
in the centre.

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:18.335
It is the one that makes everybody flower
properly

00:03:18.553 --> 00:03:25.002
and to understand the value of their power,
value of their freedom.

00:03:25.203 --> 00:03:29.245
If that happens, you should also respect
that

00:03:29.446 --> 00:03:34.442
for younger generation which is coming up.

00:03:36.093 --> 00:03:39.197
May God Bless you all.
