Today is a New Year day. So I am telling
them

00:11.890 --> 00:16.128
they have to decide now, Indians, that if
the children are born realized

00:16.329 --> 00:21.734
you should not put any sort of pressure
on them

00:21.935 --> 00:30.632
of your culture, I don’t agree there.

00:30.833 --> 00:37.161
The culture of love is the culture
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:37.531 --> 00:43.643
Of course, Indian culture is very
deep-rooted, very beautiful, everything,

00:43.844 --> 00:52.774
but the, I think the, to the trees of this
great culture,

00:52.975 --> 01:00.314
you have to give that some nourishment,
some water of love.

01:00.515 --> 01:04.888
Unless and until you use that, they will
not grow.

01:08.904 --> 01:18.675
So that is how we can take and give
something nice from each other.

01:29.646 --> 01:36.983
I will be very happy to see that all those
children who are born realized,

01:37.184 --> 01:42.141
grow to be the saints of this country

01:42.342 --> 01:45.919
and the same with the western people.

01:46.120 --> 01:50.498
They should also respect their children,
love them,

01:50.699 --> 01:54.447
give them all the freedom that is needed
for their growth,

01:54.648 --> 01:58.332
instead of cutting all the time.

01:58.745 --> 02:03.067
If you go on cutting the trees, they will
never grow

02:03.870 --> 02:08.828
and they are on the natural grounds
of Sahaja Yoga.

02:09.377 --> 02:15.191
So this culture, Indian culture which is
very great, I must say,

02:15.392 --> 02:22.741
but there is one thing which is missing
in it is the water of love.

02:22.942 --> 02:29.698
Even the Gurus you see, oh my God, I have
heard about them

02:29.914 --> 02:33.503
that the way they used to treat their
disciples,

02:33.713 --> 02:38.039
I've said, “Let these Gurus go to hell,
who cares.”

02:38.248 --> 02:40.400
And those who would not trouble

02:40.601 --> 02:44.754
would be satisfied if you give them some
money.

02:45.787 --> 02:47.642
With money they are satisfied,

02:47.843 --> 02:50.210
but they would not hit you, they wouldn’t
do anything.

02:50.420 --> 02:52.583
There are only two types of Gurus.

02:52.784 --> 02:56.723
One who would take money, exploit

02:56.924 --> 03:04.878
and the others who would treat them
just like, I don’t know what.

03:06.340 --> 03:12.232
Sahaja Yoga is in the centre. It is
in the centre.

03:12.433 --> 03:18.335
It is the one that makes everybody flower
properly

03:18.553 --> 03:25.002
and to understand the value of their power,
value of their freedom.

03:25.203 --> 03:29.245
If that happens, you should also respect
that

03:29.446 --> 03:34.442
for younger generation which is coming up.

03:36.093 --> 03:39.197
May God Bless you all.
