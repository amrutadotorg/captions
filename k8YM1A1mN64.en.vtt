00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:05.795
Today I just thought that there are

00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:08.670
quite a lot of people who have come for the first time.

00:00:09.312 --> 00:00:11.342
And I should tell them about

00:00:12.156 --> 00:00:15.702
the significance of Puja.

00:00:16.132 --> 00:00:21.559
Because, as the western style of life is,

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:26.890
that they're meant to be like this.

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:32.259
To seek something outside, to go outside,

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:36.321
find out new ways and methods to grow outside.

00:00:37.153 --> 00:00:41.055
Now this is the knowledge of your roots.

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:45.604
Knowledge, through which you receive your nourishment,

00:00:45.973 --> 00:00:50.456
this knowledge is not known to you before

00:00:50.887 --> 00:00:53.488
and was not deliberately told

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:56.898
because you are supposed to grow outside.

00:00:57.143 --> 00:01:02.067
Now when you have to go inside, then you have to understand

00:01:02.268 --> 00:01:07.018
the divine laws and divine methods, how it works out.

00:01:08.028 --> 00:01:10.981
The Puja has a significance,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.228
from ancient times the saints described them.

00:01:15.428 --> 00:01:18.361
Because in India, the whole climate is such

00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:21.850
that you can live under a tree,

00:01:22.375 --> 00:01:25.195
live in a forest no problem,

00:01:25.396 --> 00:01:28.958
you can eat fruits and very happily you could be in a forest.

00:01:29.192 --> 00:01:33.009
There is no need to have bed or anything, it is so warm and nice,

00:01:33.224 --> 00:01:37.259
and then always enjoy the bliss of a forest.

00:01:38.275 --> 00:01:41.667
And thus many people went into the forest

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.079
and started thinking, looking at the whole world from that

00:01:47.618 --> 00:01:49.352
solitude,

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.238
what is the problem with human being?

00:01:51.446 --> 00:01:52.836
Why are we here?

00:01:53.055 --> 00:01:54.752
What should we do?

00:01:54.953 --> 00:01:57.630
What is the purpose of this human life?

00:01:57.973 --> 00:02:00.500
Why God has given us this beautiful human life?

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:02.824
They started thinking about it.

00:02:03.067 --> 00:02:05.936
And that is how they went into meditative position,

00:02:06.137 --> 00:02:09.919
meditative entry within themselves.

00:02:10.152 --> 00:02:13.880
And when they started meditating, they found all about Kundalini,

00:02:14.081 --> 00:02:18.144
about chakras and the deities that reside on them.

00:02:18.441 --> 00:02:22.745
Now, these deities have resided from eternal times.

00:02:23.011 --> 00:02:27.766
We can say in the abode of God they have all resided there

00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:32.495
and then they were reflected on this Earth

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:37.721
and they incarnated just to give us

00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:40.740
a better and better awareness.

00:02:41.138 --> 00:02:43.602
We could have avoided all this.

00:02:43.886 --> 00:02:46.680
It could have been very easy

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:51.544
if we had listened to God at the time of Adam and Eve.

00:02:51.895 --> 00:02:54.648
At the time of Adam and Eve,

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:59.753
it was told that you should not eat the fruit of knowledge.

00:03:00.008 --> 00:03:02.953
Now, that was not the fruit of the true knowledge,

00:03:03.187 --> 00:03:06.799
but the fruit of knowledge was the knowledge about the matter,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.218
the knowledge about things.

00:03:09.444 --> 00:03:14.567
So, as you know, the story is, satanic forces worked,

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.372
they lured both of them and they started

00:03:19.028 --> 00:03:22.559
developing themselves on the other side.

00:03:23.044 --> 00:03:24.778
That is how they made a mistake.

00:03:25.098 --> 00:03:27.801
That is why it is called as original sin.

00:03:28.086 --> 00:03:31.590
And that original sin has brought us to this brink now,

00:03:31.862 --> 00:03:33.503
and we have to go back.

00:03:33.703 --> 00:03:36.874
We have to go back within ourselves to find our roots.

00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:39.091
And that is why to improve

00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:42.383
on their mistakes and to improve on their ignorance

00:03:42.583 --> 00:03:46.160
that is how the first ignorance was set in.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.862
The darkness of ignorance was set in because of that mistake.

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:54.535
And then from darkness we had to come to human stage.

00:03:54.834 --> 00:03:57.281
And when we have to come to human stage, we have to pass

00:03:57.482 --> 00:04:02.638
through all those different various stages of life where

00:04:04.575 --> 00:04:06.950
incarnations had to take place.

00:04:07.168 --> 00:04:09.303
So, now, as as you know very well,

00:04:09.746 --> 00:04:13.880
that we have incarnations placed within our centres

00:04:14.186 --> 00:04:17.053
which are not yet awakened.

00:04:17.615 --> 00:04:20.760
That means they are not in our attention.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:24.502
They are not to be felt in our central nervous system.

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:28.792
Or we cannot feel them on our finger tips, to be very very simple.

00:04:28.992 --> 00:04:33.494
So they are there, but they are not acting according to our desire.

00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:36.916
We do not know them and they do not listen to us.

00:04:37.116 --> 00:04:41.119
They do what is right for them or what they think is proper.

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.483
You have no connection with them so far.

00:04:44.882 --> 00:04:48.882
So, the first thing is to connect yourself

00:04:49.083 --> 00:04:52.399
with those different stages through which you have passed.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.999
So, the first as you know is the Ganesha's stage,

00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:57.914
it is innocence. Innocence, the

00:04:58.115 --> 00:05:02.041
formless of innocence was made into Shri Ganesha,

00:05:02.533 --> 00:05:08.033
because some nucleus has to emit that innocence.

00:05:09.267 --> 00:05:12.118
Now, in the whole world

00:05:12.556 --> 00:05:16.450
there are eight such creations of the Mother Earth,

00:05:16.662 --> 00:05:20.296
and luckily they are in Maharastra.

00:05:20.632 --> 00:05:23.631
You will find Maharastrian people on the whole are innocent,

00:05:23.842 --> 00:05:27.087
compared to others, they are rather innocent by nature.

00:05:27.312 --> 00:05:31.760
And the reason is from the Mother Earth only the innocence is emitted.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:35.223
So the first thing is that within us to establish innocence

00:05:35.423 --> 00:05:37.449
we have to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.851
So, when you worship Me as Shri Ganesha,

00:05:40.051 --> 00:05:42.845
the Shri Ganesha within you is awakened.

00:05:43.071 --> 00:05:45.525
You see the result of that.

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:47.422
So, the people who are suffering,

00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:52.460
say, from the trouble of all these perversions,

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.266
these modern diseases that have come,

00:05:55.508 --> 00:05:57.367
must establish their Shri Ganesha.

00:05:57.567 --> 00:06:01.193
If they cannot establish their Shri Ganesha, they cannot be cured.

00:06:01.466 --> 00:06:04.228
So their innocence has to be first established.

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.850
If he cannot establish their innocence,

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:08.809
we cannot cure them.

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:12.424
First and foremost thing is to establish Shri Ganesha.

00:06:12.667 --> 00:06:16.352
And Shri Ganesha is made out of the Mother Earth element.

00:06:16.552 --> 00:06:20.190
So, by praying to Shri Ganesha we also establish Him,

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:24.309
in a city, in a place like this place now

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.609
is San Francisco, where I came here first we had no Puja, nothing.

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:31.616
That is why the whole thing was just touch and go.

00:06:31.855 --> 00:06:33.385
I couldn't go deep into people.

00:06:33.586 --> 00:06:35.878
I couldn't go deep into the place and so the,

00:06:36.078 --> 00:06:38.150
I didn't know how I would be able to manage,

00:06:38.351 --> 00:06:42.561
because there is no education on this.

00:06:42.841 --> 00:06:44.889
People are not educated about it.

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.485
But in India immediately the first thing is Puja.

00:06:47.685 --> 00:06:48.877
They will not come to my lecture,

00:06:49.077 --> 00:06:50.736
they will not come to anything, first is Puja.

00:06:50.936 --> 00:06:53.755
If there is a Puja, everybody is getting up at 4 o'clock,

00:06:54.022 --> 00:06:56.509
having a bath, getting ready to come to Puja.

00:06:56.709 --> 00:06:58.722
Because they know the importance of it,

00:06:58.922 --> 00:07:04.273
that just your essence is awakened by it.

00:07:04.547 --> 00:07:08.117
Essence is awakened and to awaken the essence

00:07:08.318 --> 00:07:11.461
you have to be

00:07:11.716 --> 00:07:13.896
there, at a place where this is done,

00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:17.117
so that your essence is awakened.

00:07:17.318 --> 00:07:20.242
Now, the trouble is with ego-oriented societies,

00:07:20.443 --> 00:07:22.239
is very difficult to tell them about Puja.

00:07:22.482 --> 00:07:24.757
It’s find it difficult, that is why we do not allow

00:07:24.958 --> 00:07:26.978
everyone to come to Puja for one reason,

00:07:27.178 --> 00:07:29.750
because as soon as they see something happening,

00:07:29.775 --> 00:07:31.447
their ego starts up, you see.

00:07:31.472 --> 00:07:33.618
And instead of doing anything to them,

00:07:33.818 --> 00:07:38.978
the barrier is so much, that I can't just do anything about it.

00:07:39.003 --> 00:07:42.204
The barrier is too much in their ego, they have their own ideas,

00:07:42.404 --> 00:07:44.665
their own conceptions, their own feeling,

00:07:44.865 --> 00:07:50.107
and it's impossible to penetrate deep into them, so it is a waste.

00:07:50.359 --> 00:07:52.485
And if you cannot receive the vibrations,

00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:55.464
I feel the pain in my own centres.

00:07:55.683 --> 00:07:57.988
Because the deities, you see, get so annoyed,

00:07:58.212 --> 00:08:00.100
and they don't like it and they think that

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.932
why Mother should waste Her energy with these people

00:08:03.132 --> 00:08:04.587
who do not understand about Puja.

00:08:04.788 --> 00:08:08.452
So, I want to prepare you beforehand, that you keep yourself open.

00:08:08.686 --> 00:08:10.530
Don't allow your ego to come up.

00:08:10.555 --> 00:08:13.263
It's nothing for Me to gain. It is for you to gain.

00:08:13.463 --> 00:08:15.014
Keep your minds open.

00:08:15.214 --> 00:08:17.628
The trouble is that at the time of this Sahasrara opening,

00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:20.780
this brain, everybody's brain is upside down.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.997
It is impossible, you try to turn it and they jump on you.

00:08:24.197 --> 00:08:26.491
It is a big problem for me, it is the biggest problem.

00:08:26.691 --> 00:08:28.452
Because, all other incarnations came,

00:08:28.652 --> 00:08:32.249
they didn't have to do this difficult work of making you something.

00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:36.052
Just it was to awaken within you a awareness,

00:08:36.253 --> 00:08:38.900
like Christ had to awaken your Agyna Charka.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:42.645
Alright, he has crucified himself for the same reason,

00:08:42.846 --> 00:08:45.236
He resurrected Himself for the same reason.

00:08:45.436 --> 00:08:47.485
It was a very hard life for him

00:08:47.685 --> 00:08:50.785
and, for the Mother, it was even worse, no doubt.

00:08:50.985 --> 00:08:56.438
But still, one should know that this is a very hazardous thing,

00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:00.145
to transform people and then to establish them

00:09:00.345 --> 00:09:06.297
and create out of these little seeds a huge big tree of a saint.

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:10.533
Now, in the same way, we have got Moses, we have got Abraham,

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:14.115
all these great saints are within our, in our void.

00:09:14.316 --> 00:09:16.966
They are the gurus. And on a Guru Puja,

00:09:17.167 --> 00:09:19.190
when you worship me on the Guru Puja day,

00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:22.707
that time these are awakened within you, and you become a master,

00:09:22.907 --> 00:09:24.151
you become yourself a Guru.

00:09:24.351 --> 00:09:27.100
You yourself know so much,

00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:29.577
even I don't have to tell you, I don't think

00:09:29.777 --> 00:09:34.138
I have talked to people very much in private, or explain to things.

00:09:34.338 --> 00:09:36.958
But somehow they become so much full of knowledge,

00:09:37.158 --> 00:09:39.733
that is rather surprising how they understand. Like,

00:09:39.933 --> 00:09:41.399
I was talking to Yogi Mahajan

00:09:41.599 --> 00:09:44.828
and he was telling me what's the problem is with human being and,

00:09:45.029 --> 00:09:48.467
you see, he was telling me how we cannot relate to them and all.

00:09:48.534 --> 00:09:51.388
Which is interesting, because My father did same to Me.

00:09:51.589 --> 00:09:55.652
I said that he is my first guru and all of you my second gurus.

00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:58.619
Because I don't understand human beings.

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:00.825
You see for example, this homosexual business.

00:10:01.025 --> 00:10:03.545
When Gregoire, with very great reluctance, you see,

00:10:03.745 --> 00:10:05.002
told me through somebody else,

00:10:05.303 --> 00:10:08.053
I  nearly fainted, actually could not understand,

00:10:08.078 --> 00:10:10.502
what's happened to them? Now, what am I to do?

00:10:10.702 --> 00:10:13.255
And I couldn't eat my food for one week.

00:10:13.455 --> 00:10:15.452
I felt so bad about the whole thing.

00:10:15.477 --> 00:10:18.214
Like, My own children where are they?.

00:10:18.239 --> 00:10:22.323
If you have a heart of an intense Mother,

00:10:22.558 --> 00:10:24.396
you can understand what she feels about it.

00:10:24.597 --> 00:10:25.964
And I knew they are in for trouble,

00:10:26.165 --> 00:10:30.188
I knew everything was going to be very very hazardous.

00:10:30.432 --> 00:10:32.379
But doesn't matter, by God's grace

00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:34.664
everything will be all right. I am sure it will work out.

00:10:34.865 --> 00:10:37.150
So, first we have to establish Shri Ganesha.

00:10:37.358 --> 00:10:39.845
First of all, we have to establish Shri Ganesha within ourselves

00:10:40.046 --> 00:10:43.841
and Shri Ganesha in this place called San Francisco.

00:10:44.084 --> 00:10:47.333
Alright? That is why we have to first do Shri Ganesha's Puja.

00:10:47.575 --> 00:10:49.069
Then, secondly I told him

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:52.616
that if possible we should do little bit of Shri Vishnu's,

00:10:52.817 --> 00:10:56.673
because he is the one who gives us the evolutionary power

00:10:56.874 --> 00:11:00.781
by which we can evolve ourselves and evolve others.

00:11:00.982 --> 00:11:04.309
So we have a little time for Shri Vishnu's Puja.

00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:07.122
Also, they do Havanas all that for Shri Vishnu's Puja,

00:11:07.447 --> 00:11:10.401
which is very good to clear the atmosphere sort of thing.

00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:13.337
But we will do next year all these things, perhaps, maybe,

00:11:13.538 --> 00:11:16.003
because now we don't have these arrangements.

00:11:16.203 --> 00:11:18.209
But that would be a very good idea, too.

00:11:18.234 --> 00:11:24.100
And then thirdly they want to do the the Puja of Shakti, the Mother.

00:11:24.301 --> 00:11:26.873
Because, unless and until you have power,

00:11:27.073 --> 00:11:29.301
even if all the deities are there, you will be exhausted,

00:11:29.502 --> 00:11:30.676
you wouldn't be able to work it out.

00:11:30.877 --> 00:11:34.824
So the third is of your own power, of your Kundalini,

00:11:35.025 --> 00:11:39.908
of the power that is going to work out this Divine work.

00:11:40.134 --> 00:11:41.503
That is how we have three Pujas.

00:11:41.703 --> 00:11:44.464
But none of you should get into an ego trip.

00:11:44.665 --> 00:11:47.041
Please, keep your ego on one side.

00:11:47.242 --> 00:11:50.743
Just now, see for yourself how it works within yourself.

00:11:50.943 --> 00:11:54.478
You start feeling good, you start feeling better vibrations

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.649
and you start feeling much better and healthier within yourself.

00:11:58.849 --> 00:12:01.692
So, just keep your self open. It is you

00:12:01.895 --> 00:12:03.784
who has to achieve something, not Me.

00:12:03.984 --> 00:12:07.868
I don't have to achieve anything. So you better make use of Me.

00:12:08.077 --> 00:12:11.738
Because I am here only for today and then I will go away.

00:12:11.938 --> 00:12:13.645
So, make best use of Me

00:12:13.845 --> 00:12:16.807
and that is why I said as many as possible try to call

00:12:17.008 --> 00:12:19.268
the people over here will be a good idea.

00:12:19.321 --> 00:12:20.118
May God Bless you.
