00:01.749 --> 00:05.795
Today I just thought that there are

00:06.124 --> 00:08.670
quite a lot of people who have come for the first time.

00:09.312 --> 00:11.342
And I should tell them about

00:12.156 --> 00:15.702
the significance of Puja.

00:16.132 --> 00:21.559
Because, as the western style of life is,

00:22.465 --> 00:26.890
that they're meant to be like this.

00:27.402 --> 00:32.259
To seek something outside, to go outside,

00:32.459 --> 00:36.321
find out new ways and methods to grow outside.

00:37.153 --> 00:41.055
Now this is the knowledge of your roots.

00:41.286 --> 00:45.604
Knowledge, through which you receive your nourishment,

00:45.973 --> 00:50.456
this knowledge is not known to you before

00:50.887 --> 00:53.488
and was not deliberately told

00:53.689 --> 00:56.898
because you are supposed to grow outside.

00:57.143 --> 01:02.067
Now when you have to go inside, then you have to understand

01:02.268 --> 01:07.018
the divine laws and divine methods, how it works out.

01:08.028 --> 01:10.981
The Puja has a significance,

01:11.270 --> 01:15.228
from ancient times the saints described them.

01:15.428 --> 01:18.361
Because in India, the whole climate is such

01:18.611 --> 01:21.850
that you can live under a tree,

01:22.375 --> 01:25.195
live in a forest no problem,

01:25.396 --> 01:28.958
you can eat fruits and very happily you could be in a forest.

01:29.192 --> 01:33.009
There is no need to have bed or anything, it is so warm and nice,

01:33.224 --> 01:37.259
and then always enjoy the bliss of a forest.

01:38.275 --> 01:41.667
And thus many people went into the forest

01:41.900 --> 01:46.079
and started thinking, looking at the whole world from that

01:47.618 --> 01:49.352
solitude,

01:49.750 --> 01:51.238
what is the problem with human being?

01:51.446 --> 01:52.836
Why are we here?

01:53.055 --> 01:54.752
What should we do?

01:54.953 --> 01:57.630
What is the purpose of this human life?

01:57.973 --> 02:00.500
Why God has given us this beautiful human life?

02:00.700 --> 02:02.824
They started thinking about it.

02:03.067 --> 02:05.936
And that is how they went into meditative position,

02:06.137 --> 02:09.919
meditative entry within themselves.

02:10.152 --> 02:13.880
And when they started meditating, they found all about Kundalini,

02:14.081 --> 02:18.144
about chakras and the deities that reside on them.

02:18.441 --> 02:22.745
Now, these deities have resided from eternal times.

02:23.011 --> 02:27.766
We can say in the abode of God they have all resided there

02:27.987 --> 02:32.495
and then they were reflected on this Earth

02:32.990 --> 02:37.721
and they incarnated just to give us

02:37.921 --> 02:40.740
a better and better awareness.

02:41.138 --> 02:43.602
We could have avoided all this.

02:43.886 --> 02:46.680
It could have been very easy

02:46.915 --> 02:51.544
if we had listened to God at the time of Adam and Eve.

02:51.895 --> 02:54.648
At the time of Adam and Eve,

02:55.008 --> 02:59.753
it was told that you should not eat the fruit of knowledge.

03:00.008 --> 03:02.953
Now, that was not the fruit of the true knowledge,

03:03.187 --> 03:06.799
but the fruit of knowledge was the knowledge about the matter,

03:07.000 --> 03:09.218
the knowledge about things.

03:09.444 --> 03:14.567
So, as you know, the story is, satanic forces worked,

03:14.819 --> 03:18.372
they lured both of them and they started

03:19.028 --> 03:22.559
developing themselves on the other side.

03:23.044 --> 03:24.778
That is how they made a mistake.

03:25.098 --> 03:27.801
That is why it is called as original sin.

03:28.086 --> 03:31.590
And that original sin has brought us to this brink now,

03:31.862 --> 03:33.503
and we have to go back.

03:33.703 --> 03:36.874
We have to go back within ourselves to find our roots.

03:37.074 --> 03:39.091
And that is why to improve

03:39.291 --> 03:42.383
on their mistakes and to improve on their ignorance

03:42.583 --> 03:46.160
that is how the first ignorance was set in.

03:47.480 --> 03:50.862
The darkness of ignorance was set in because of that mistake.

03:51.062 --> 03:54.535
And then from darkness we had to come to human stage.

03:54.834 --> 03:57.281
And when we have to come to human stage, we have to pass

03:57.482 --> 04:02.638
through all those different various stages of life where

04:04.575 --> 04:06.950
incarnations had to take place.

04:07.168 --> 04:09.303
So, now, as as you know very well,

04:09.746 --> 04:13.880
that we have incarnations placed within our centres

04:14.186 --> 04:17.053
which are not yet awakened.

04:17.615 --> 04:20.760
That means they are not in our attention.

04:20.960 --> 04:24.502
They are not to be felt in our central nervous system.

04:24.736 --> 04:28.792
Or we cannot feel them on our finger tips, to be very very simple.

04:28.992 --> 04:33.494
So they are there, but they are not acting according to our desire.

04:33.694 --> 04:36.916
We do not know them and they do not listen to us.

04:37.116 --> 04:41.119
They do what is right for them or what they think is proper.

04:41.319 --> 04:44.483
You have no connection with them so far.

04:44.882 --> 04:48.882
So, the first thing is to connect yourself

04:49.083 --> 04:52.399
with those different stages through which you have passed.

04:52.600 --> 04:54.999
So, the first as you know is the Ganesha's stage,

04:55.221 --> 04:57.914
it is innocence. Innocence, the

04:58.115 --> 05:02.041
formless of innocence was made into Shri Ganesha,

05:02.533 --> 05:08.033
because some nucleus has to emit that innocence.

05:09.267 --> 05:12.118
Now, in the whole world

05:12.556 --> 05:16.450
there are eight such creations of the Mother Earth,

05:16.662 --> 05:20.296
and luckily they are in Maharastra.

05:20.632 --> 05:23.631
You will find Maharastrian people on the whole are innocent,

05:23.842 --> 05:27.087
compared to others, they are rather innocent by nature.

05:27.312 --> 05:31.760
And the reason is from the Mother Earth only the innocence is emitted.

05:32.080 --> 05:35.223
So the first thing is that within us to establish innocence

05:35.423 --> 05:37.449
we have to worship Shri Ganesha.

05:37.650 --> 05:39.851
So, when you worship Me as Shri Ganesha,

05:40.051 --> 05:42.845
the Shri Ganesha within you is awakened.

05:43.071 --> 05:45.525
You see the result of that.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.422
So, the people who are suffering,

05:47.641 --> 05:52.460
say, from the trouble of all these perversions,

05:52.660 --> 05:55.266
these modern diseases that have come,

05:55.508 --> 05:57.367
must establish their Shri Ganesha.

05:57.567 --> 06:01.193
If they cannot establish their Shri Ganesha, they cannot be cured.

06:01.466 --> 06:04.228
So their innocence has to be first established.

06:04.590 --> 06:06.850
If he cannot establish their innocence,

06:07.050 --> 06:08.809
we cannot cure them.

06:09.009 --> 06:12.424
First and foremost thing is to establish Shri Ganesha.

06:12.667 --> 06:16.352
And Shri Ganesha is made out of the Mother Earth element.

06:16.552 --> 06:20.190
So, by praying to Shri Ganesha we also establish Him,

06:20.390 --> 06:24.309
in a city, in a place like this place now

06:24.509 --> 06:28.609
is San Francisco, where I came here first we had no Puja, nothing.

06:28.809 --> 06:31.616
That is why the whole thing was just touch and go.

06:31.855 --> 06:33.385
I couldn't go deep into people.

06:33.586 --> 06:35.878
I couldn't go deep into the place and so the,

06:36.078 --> 06:38.150
I didn't know how I would be able to manage,

06:38.351 --> 06:42.561
because there is no education on this.

06:42.841 --> 06:44.889
People are not educated about it.

06:45.090 --> 06:47.485
But in India immediately the first thing is Puja.

06:47.685 --> 06:48.877
They will not come to my lecture,

06:49.077 --> 06:50.736
they will not come to anything, first is Puja.

06:50.936 --> 06:53.755
If there is a Puja, everybody is getting up at 4 o'clock,

06:54.022 --> 06:56.509
having a bath, getting ready to come to Puja.

06:56.709 --> 06:58.722
Because they know the importance of it,

06:58.922 --> 07:04.273
that just your essence is awakened by it.

07:04.547 --> 07:08.117
Essence is awakened and to awaken the essence

07:08.318 --> 07:11.461
you have to be

07:11.716 --> 07:13.896
there, at a place where this is done,

07:14.161 --> 07:17.117
so that your essence is awakened.

07:17.318 --> 07:20.242
Now, the trouble is with ego-oriented societies,

07:20.443 --> 07:22.239
is very difficult to tell them about Puja.

07:22.482 --> 07:24.757
Itâ€™s find it difficult, that is why we do not allow

07:24.958 --> 07:26.978
everyone to come to Puja for one reason,

07:27.178 --> 07:29.750
because as soon as they see something happening,

07:29.775 --> 07:31.447
their ego starts up, you see.

07:31.472 --> 07:33.618
And instead of doing anything to them,

07:33.818 --> 07:38.978
the barrier is so much, that I can't just do anything about it.

07:39.003 --> 07:42.204
The barrier is too much in their ego, they have their own ideas,

07:42.404 --> 07:44.665
their own conceptions, their own feeling,

07:44.865 --> 07:50.107
and it's impossible to penetrate deep into them, so it is a waste.

07:50.359 --> 07:52.485
And if you cannot receive the vibrations,

07:52.685 --> 07:55.464
I feel the pain in my own centres.

07:55.683 --> 07:57.988
Because the deities, you see, get so annoyed,

07:58.212 --> 08:00.100
and they don't like it and they think that

08:00.300 --> 08:02.932
why Mother should waste Her energy with these people

08:03.132 --> 08:04.587
who do not understand about Puja.

08:04.788 --> 08:08.452
So, I want to prepare you beforehand, that you keep yourself open.

08:08.686 --> 08:10.530
Don't allow your ego to come up.

08:10.555 --> 08:13.263
It's nothing for Me to gain. It is for you to gain.

08:13.463 --> 08:15.014
Keep your minds open.

08:15.214 --> 08:17.628
The trouble is that at the time of this Sahasrara opening,

08:17.831 --> 08:20.780
this brain, everybody's brain is upside down.

08:20.980 --> 08:23.997
It is impossible, you try to turn it and they jump on you.

08:24.197 --> 08:26.491
It is a big problem for me, it is the biggest problem.

08:26.691 --> 08:28.452
Because, all other incarnations came,

08:28.652 --> 08:32.249
they didn't have to do this difficult work of making you something.

08:32.449 --> 08:36.052
Just it was to awaken within you a awareness,

08:36.253 --> 08:38.900
like Christ had to awaken your Agyna Charka.

08:39.120 --> 08:42.645
Alright, he has crucified himself for the same reason,

08:42.846 --> 08:45.236
He resurrected Himself for the same reason.

08:45.436 --> 08:47.485
It was a very hard life for him

08:47.685 --> 08:50.785
and, for the Mother, it was even worse, no doubt.

08:50.985 --> 08:56.438
But still, one should know that this is a very hazardous thing,

08:56.680 --> 09:00.145
to transform people and then to establish them

09:00.345 --> 09:06.297
and create out of these little seeds a huge big tree of a saint.

09:06.950 --> 09:10.533
Now, in the same way, we have got Moses, we have got Abraham,

09:10.733 --> 09:14.115
all these great saints are within our, in our void.

09:14.316 --> 09:16.966
They are the gurus. And on a Guru Puja,

09:17.167 --> 09:19.190
when you worship me on the Guru Puja day,

09:19.390 --> 09:22.707
that time these are awakened within you, and you become a master,

09:22.907 --> 09:24.151
you become yourself a Guru.

09:24.351 --> 09:27.100
You yourself know so much,

09:27.300 --> 09:29.577
even I don't have to tell you, I don't think

09:29.777 --> 09:34.138
I have talked to people very much in private, or explain to things.

09:34.338 --> 09:36.958
But somehow they become so much full of knowledge,

09:37.158 --> 09:39.733
that is rather surprising how they understand. Like,

09:39.933 --> 09:41.399
I was talking to Yogi Mahajan

09:41.599 --> 09:44.828
and he was telling me what's the problem is with human being and,

09:45.029 --> 09:48.467
you see, he was telling me how we cannot relate to them and all.

09:48.534 --> 09:51.388
Which is interesting, because My father did same to Me.

09:51.589 --> 09:55.652
I said that he is my first guru and all of you my second gurus.

09:56.260 --> 09:58.619
Because I don't understand human beings.

09:58.820 --> 10:00.825
You see for example, this homosexual business.

10:01.025 --> 10:03.545
When Gregoire, with very great reluctance, you see,

10:03.745 --> 10:05.002
told me through somebody else,

10:05.303 --> 10:08.053
I  nearly fainted, actually could not understand,

10:08.078 --> 10:10.502
what's happened to them? Now, what am I to do?

10:10.702 --> 10:13.255
And I couldn't eat my food for one week.

10:13.455 --> 10:15.452
I felt so bad about the whole thing.

10:15.477 --> 10:18.214
Like, My own children where are they?.

10:18.239 --> 10:22.323
If you have a heart of an intense Mother,

10:22.558 --> 10:24.396
you can understand what she feels about it.

10:24.597 --> 10:25.964
And I knew they are in for trouble,

10:26.165 --> 10:30.188
I knew everything was going to be very very hazardous.

10:30.432 --> 10:32.379
But doesn't matter, by God's grace

10:32.580 --> 10:34.664
everything will be all right. I am sure it will work out.

10:34.865 --> 10:37.150
So, first we have to establish Shri Ganesha.

10:37.358 --> 10:39.845
First of all, we have to establish Shri Ganesha within ourselves

10:40.046 --> 10:43.841
and Shri Ganesha in this place called San Francisco.

10:44.084 --> 10:47.333
Alright? That is why we have to first do Shri Ganesha's Puja.

10:47.575 --> 10:49.069
Then, secondly I told him

10:49.270 --> 10:52.616
that if possible we should do little bit of Shri Vishnu's,

10:52.817 --> 10:56.673
because he is the one who gives us the evolutionary power

10:56.874 --> 11:00.781
by which we can evolve ourselves and evolve others.

11:00.982 --> 11:04.309
So we have a little time for Shri Vishnu's Puja.

11:04.509 --> 11:07.122
Also, they do Havanas all that for Shri Vishnu's Puja,

11:07.447 --> 11:10.401
which is very good to clear the atmosphere sort of thing.

11:10.601 --> 11:13.337
But we will do next year all these things, perhaps, maybe,

11:13.538 --> 11:16.003
because now we don't have these arrangements.

11:16.203 --> 11:18.209
But that would be a very good idea, too.

11:18.234 --> 11:24.100
And then thirdly they want to do the the Puja of Shakti, the Mother.

11:24.301 --> 11:26.873
Because, unless and until you have power,

11:27.073 --> 11:29.301
even if all the deities are there, you will be exhausted,

11:29.502 --> 11:30.676
you wouldn't be able to work it out.

11:30.877 --> 11:34.824
So the third is of your own power, of your Kundalini,

11:35.025 --> 11:39.908
of the power that is going to work out this Divine work.

11:40.134 --> 11:41.503
That is how we have three Pujas.

11:41.703 --> 11:44.464
But none of you should get into an ego trip.

11:44.665 --> 11:47.041
Please, keep your ego on one side.

11:47.242 --> 11:50.743
Just now, see for yourself how it works within yourself.

11:50.943 --> 11:54.478
You start feeling good, you start feeling better vibrations

11:54.760 --> 11:58.649
and you start feeling much better and healthier within yourself.

11:58.849 --> 12:01.692
So, just keep your self open. It is you

12:01.895 --> 12:03.784
who has to achieve something, not Me.

12:03.984 --> 12:07.868
I don't have to achieve anything. So you better make use of Me.

12:08.077 --> 12:11.738
Because I am here only for today and then I will go away.

12:11.938 --> 12:13.645
So, make best use of Me

12:13.845 --> 12:16.807
and that is why I said as many as possible try to call

12:17.008 --> 12:19.268
the people over here will be a good idea.

12:19.321 --> 12:20.118
May God Bless you.
