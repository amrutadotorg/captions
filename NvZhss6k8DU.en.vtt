WEBVTT

00:16.859 --> 00:20.490
any other question please

00:20.680 --> 00:28.620
just be little loudly can you say loudly

00:26.230 --> 00:28.620
please

00:29.040 --> 00:33.720
looking

00:31.080 --> 00:42.690
why don't we

00:33.720 --> 00:44.580
why you don't like it I said something

00:42.690 --> 00:45.510
here is a question really is something I

00:44.580 --> 00:49.080
can't understand

00:45.510 --> 00:52.680
you see if I have something if this

00:49.080 --> 00:55.230
picture is my true picture then why not

00:52.680 --> 00:58.379
have it in this picture you will be

00:55.230 --> 01:00.330
surprised the person who first got

00:58.379 --> 01:03.000
realization got through this picture in

01:00.330 --> 01:04.619
this picture there are vibrations when

01:03.000 --> 01:07.020
you will get realized you will know that

01:04.619 --> 01:09.149
only this picture has such vibrations it

01:07.020 --> 01:11.250
was a real thing it is thank God the

01:09.149 --> 01:13.080
science has given us the real thing if

01:11.250 --> 01:15.560
there were cameras before we would have

01:13.080 --> 01:17.700
had pictures of all those great people

01:15.560 --> 01:19.020
because there were no photographs they

01:17.700 --> 01:21.360
said better not have any pictures

01:19.020 --> 01:23.250
because all the pictures were imaginary

01:21.360 --> 01:26.729
done by people who wanted to have

01:23.250 --> 01:30.619
someone with this picture

01:26.729 --> 01:33.119
many people have been cured all right

01:30.619 --> 01:35.580
it's a very good thing that has happened

01:33.119 --> 01:37.950
that we can take pictures now because I

01:35.580 --> 01:42.050
think I cannot meet everyone in this

01:37.950 --> 01:42.050
world but they cannot see my picture I

01:46.789 --> 01:55.200
do not claim i doing no question of

01:51.569 --> 01:59.340
blaming you see I do it have done it you

01:55.200 --> 02:04.250
can do it don't you everyone can be this

01:59.340 --> 02:04.250
dr. Warren Delta it's not so many people

02:05.959 --> 02:10.709
yes it is surprisingly low myself I was

02:09.509 --> 02:12.510
surprised that you are

02:10.709 --> 02:14.790
that's my photograph has also got

02:12.510 --> 02:17.340
reservations and people get cured before

02:14.790 --> 02:20.819
the glass in your country maybe when I

02:17.340 --> 02:22.860
gave the press was very kind to the

02:20.819 --> 02:25.940
reason was there was a lady who was sick

02:22.860 --> 02:31.830
with coma as I said she had what love

02:25.940 --> 02:33.510
cerebral aneurysm and once another

02:31.830 --> 02:35.670
disciple of mine

02:33.510 --> 02:40.020
to fight photogram put it under her head

02:35.670 --> 02:41.630
and she started getting all right in the

02:40.020 --> 02:44.310
sense that she started opening her eyes

02:41.630 --> 02:46.530
so the doctor got frightened they said

02:44.310 --> 02:48.540
if even if she gets all right she will

02:46.530 --> 02:51.180
be damaged she won't be able to follow

02:48.540 --> 03:00.959
but today she's perfect all right not

02:51.180 --> 03:03.980
really bad but she is very hard work

03:00.959 --> 03:08.100
from the photograph from the photograph

03:03.980 --> 03:10.800
the photograph is a real image of myself

03:08.100 --> 03:13.860
see and this fine body has got a

03:10.800 --> 03:18.090
positions which aim it's working same

03:13.860 --> 03:20.640
happens with the photograph that too has

03:18.090 --> 03:23.340
the same coefficients of course it

03:20.640 --> 03:26.840
hasn't got the other dimension but it

03:23.340 --> 03:30.150
also emits the vibrations because of the

03:26.840 --> 03:32.040
coefficients being the same say even if

03:30.150 --> 03:33.840
you take prize photograph it's not real

03:32.040 --> 03:35.549
because it's all come out of the

03:33.840 --> 03:37.650
unconscious all right but just got a

03:35.549 --> 03:41.160
free Majan Asian put it any photographic

03:37.650 --> 03:43.500
tape of any person it is like that but

03:41.160 --> 03:45.660
there are so many things I've seen which

03:43.500 --> 03:45.900
are which have come out of the mother

03:45.660 --> 03:49.620
earth

03:45.900 --> 03:53.220
they emit vibrations like Stonehenge in

03:49.620 --> 03:54.900
England has vibrations so many places

03:53.220 --> 03:56.670
like that have aggression but not so

03:54.900 --> 04:02.209
strong as mine because I am a living

03:56.670 --> 04:02.209
person there was one fellow in

04:03.490 --> 04:10.390
Rasha supposed to be very intelligent he

04:07.800 --> 04:14.590
said that all right if we keep mother's

04:10.390 --> 04:18.360
photograph and also the icons we can get

04:14.590 --> 04:22.150
the same type of vibration you cannot

04:18.360 --> 04:25.270
because icons are made by some artists

04:22.150 --> 04:28.660
imaginary these are not representing

04:25.270 --> 04:32.620
actually even Maria or Christ or anyone

04:28.660 --> 04:37.630
they are all all imaginary if an Italian

04:32.620 --> 04:41.020
ones makes Christ his Italian stuff he's

04:37.630 --> 04:47.230
somebody French one makes is thin like

04:41.020 --> 04:48.970
Frenchmen if you get us somebody say

04:47.230 --> 04:54.580
from Holland he'll ever forehead like

04:48.970 --> 04:55.120
that so you can see Christ if she's

04:54.580 --> 04:58.470
Japanese

04:55.120 --> 04:58.470
he'll have [ __ ] eyes

05:00.099 --> 05:09.939
if he is Chinese she'll have no nose if

05:05.619 --> 05:14.710
it's Indian he'll be down so all kinds

05:09.939 --> 05:20.319
of crisis II and I feel that how can

05:14.710 --> 05:23.080
they emit vibrations till while with my

05:20.319 --> 05:25.539
photograph how can you come back also

05:23.080 --> 05:29.379
cameras were to be developed at this

05:25.539 --> 05:33.149
time you noticed that one cameras were

05:29.379 --> 05:36.520
developed at this time not before that

05:33.149 --> 05:40.899
this loudspeaker was not developed

05:36.520 --> 05:43.689
before this so all these things are even

05:40.899 --> 05:49.139
video even the way you are seeing my

05:43.689 --> 05:49.139
image there was that available before No

05:50.610 --> 05:59.169
so this is a very special time where

05:54.039 --> 05:59.979
science has also supported seekers to

05:59.169 --> 06:02.949
find it

05:59.979 --> 06:05.889
science has so first just like a

06:02.949 --> 06:07.270
scientist to try to accept one by

06:05.889 --> 06:08.830
whether there's nothing has to be done I

06:07.270 --> 06:11.229
mean don't have to pay me anything of

06:08.830 --> 06:13.689
course that good you don't have to do

06:11.229 --> 06:15.550
any acrobatics or anything but for

06:13.689 --> 06:16.870
example a small thing like my photograph

06:15.550 --> 06:19.059
you see many people say why your

06:16.870 --> 06:21.129
photograph so use your photograph I say

06:19.059 --> 06:22.990
if that works out you see is something

06:21.129 --> 06:24.610
surprising that's how people you

06:22.990 --> 06:26.139
challenge me why your photograph is if I

06:24.610 --> 06:27.879
not use yours I will be very happy use

06:26.139 --> 06:30.099
anybody's but doesn't work out what to

06:27.879 --> 06:32.169
do now it's mine photograph that works

06:30.099 --> 06:35.129
out but even if you don't like it you

06:32.169 --> 06:38.439
have to use it what can I do

06:35.129 --> 06:40.240
it's as simple that's bad you see but in

06:38.439 --> 06:41.889
that I don't gain anything from you I

06:40.240 --> 06:45.759
don't want anything from you nothing

06:41.889 --> 06:47.860
material that you can give me but you

06:45.759 --> 06:55.229
will enjoy you'll enjoy my laugh you

06:47.860 --> 06:58.120
will enjoy but surge or by realization

06:55.229 --> 07:00.430
how is it going to work it was a very

06:58.120 --> 07:02.019
big problem for me it's not that I can

07:00.430 --> 07:04.659
just give you a book and you just sit

07:02.019 --> 07:09.909
and read it and say that yes I have got

07:04.659 --> 07:12.969
it I become it's real becoming ripening

07:09.909 --> 07:15.060
maturing living process now how am I to

07:12.969 --> 07:20.160
do

07:15.060 --> 07:23.500
and here is the answer is a photograph

07:20.160 --> 07:28.660
so this is what it is that all your

07:23.500 --> 07:33.130
media's can be used through my

07:28.660 --> 07:35.230
photograph what a blessing and the

07:33.130 --> 07:38.350
photograph if you think is representing

07:35.230 --> 07:40.620
me I think you're not expressing it

07:38.350 --> 07:40.620
fully

07:41.400 --> 07:47.560
that was a main session my photograph

07:44.230 --> 07:51.420
are much more powerful than any sketches

07:47.560 --> 07:51.420
together even to these by mother earth

07:54.270 --> 08:03.820
because photograph has got so many

07:58.120 --> 08:07.419
elements in it for example you see it

08:03.820 --> 08:14.140
has got light element it has got water

08:07.419 --> 08:19.120
element it has got earth element it has

08:14.140 --> 08:22.230
got also air element if the air is not

08:19.120 --> 08:22.230
alright little bit

08:24.520 --> 08:29.759
and also it has got the eternally

08:33.720 --> 08:39.680
with all these five elements you cannot

08:36.630 --> 08:39.680
reduce the statute

08:43.610 --> 08:48.620
ether element it has got because if you

08:46.459 --> 08:58.310
have a photograph here you can

08:48.620 --> 09:01.670
constantly transmit it but you cannot

08:58.310 --> 09:07.220
transmit the statue as it is only the

09:01.670 --> 09:13.130
photograph of a statue thing so it has

09:07.220 --> 09:18.610
also got ether in it so photograph is

09:13.130 --> 09:18.610
much more powerful than any other statue

09:19.600 --> 09:28.250
moreover it is a reproduction

09:22.190 --> 09:35.180
no but reproduction of reality with five

09:28.250 --> 09:38.959
enemies so I wouldn't call it just a

09:35.180 --> 09:42.649
representative it's quite me because my

09:38.959 --> 09:45.709
attention is there so the protocol of

09:42.649 --> 09:49.940
these photographs also is important so

09:45.709 --> 09:52.940
start developing that faith you should

09:49.940 --> 09:59.020
keep one photograph with you all the

09:52.940 --> 09:59.020
time in your pocket respective

09:59.430 --> 10:04.670
as many as possible respective
