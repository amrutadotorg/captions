1
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:11,020
I'm happy that Dr. Warren could explain to you

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:16,000
those chakras about which I told you yesterday,

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,150
because in one short lecture

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:21,080
you can't cover all these points.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,190
And if you get your Realization

6
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:31,030
and you progress well,

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:37,000
then you can listen to My tapes

8
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,000
which are in hundreds,

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:44,140
and you can understand the knowledge is vast like ocean.

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,090
As I yesterday told you

11
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:55,160
that when you get enlightenment,

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:00:58,170
you become the knowledge.

13
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,090
It's a very confused statement;

14
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:06,160
people don't understand

15
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:10,000
what does it mean to "become the knowledge."

16
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:14,140
The other day a gentleman came to Me and he told Me that

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:17,090
"My guru has already given me the knowledge."

18
00:01:17,170 --> 00:01:19,060
I said, "How?"

19
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,150
"Because he told me, 'I've given you the knowledge.'"

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:24,140
I said, "But still, how is it, it is knowledge?

21
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,060
How do you believe that he has given you the knowledge?"

22
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,150
So he said, "No Mother, he touched me on my forehead

23
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,140
and I saw a light."

24
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:38,200
I said, "Then still, you can see the light otherwise also.

25
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,230
How is it you have got the knowledge?"

26
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,220
So he started thinking about it.

27
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:55,030
He said that "What should happen If I get the knowledge?"

28
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,030
I said, "See, this is another person sitting next to you,

29
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:01,050
he is a Sahaja Yogi.

30
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,130
He knows what Kundalini is;

31
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,130
also he knows how to raise your Kundalini.

32
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:12,080
He knows what is your problem,

33
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,110
what your chakras are catching.

34
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:17,170
He also knows what are his problems."

35
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,000
So he asked Me, "How does he know?"

36
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,000
I said, "He has become the knowledge."

37
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,030
As I yesterday I told you,

38
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,190
that on your central nervous system you should be able

39
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,080
to feel others and yourself which is inside.

40
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Now, for example, a person who is mad.

41
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:44,100
When he started becoming mad, he did not realize.

42
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,220
He did not realize that he's already possessed

43
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:49,080
and that he's getting mad,

44
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:52,160
and that he should have treatment, nothing he realized.

45
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:57,100
Gradually he became mad and he is in the lunatic asylum.

46
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:00,000
Or a person who gets a cancer

47
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,190
doesn't know he has developed a cancer,

48
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,110
till they say that

49
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:07,130
"Now it's hardly fifteen days you have to die."

50
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:10,160
This is on physical level, mental level.

51
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,220
A person who is egoistical

52
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,160
does not know that he is egoistical,

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,080
that he's oppressing others

54
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,030
and that others are part and parcel of himself.

55
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:23,100
Like Hitler never realized

56
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,130
that he was such a horrible devil,

57
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,140
that he will go to hell

58
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,060
and those who were around Hitler that time

59
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,080
did not realize that a devil is growing in this society.

60
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,030
That a devil is going to come.

61
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:44,020
Nobody realized everything,

62
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,110
and suddenly after eleven years he comes back

63
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,240
as a horrible, destructive, satanic force.

64
00:03:54,170 --> 00:04:00,210
So if you read the books written before his regime,

65
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,220
they were actually supporting him.

66
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:07,060
Because they said that "We are getting decadent,

67
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:09,060
our society is decadent

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,060
and we need a person who'll take us to austerities

69
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,030
and who will make us a little disciplined;

70
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:16,240
we need discipline, we must have discipline,"

71
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,190
and so they liked him.

72
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,110
Even the young students liked him,

73
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:24,100
when he went to the universities he charmed them by saying,

74
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,060
"We must have discipline, we should be austere,

75
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160
you should not eat this food, you should not that food,

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,140
you should become very austere."

77
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,000
And that thing was very much appreciated

78
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,030
by the young people.

79
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:40,240
They did not realize whether this man was a devil or not.

80
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,160
Now knowledge is such that

81
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:49,100
in that you see the subtle of yourself and subtle of others.

82
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:51,050
And the subtle of ours

83
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,170
and the subtle of others resides in the chakras.

84
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,110
These are the chakras which reside within us,

85
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,240
and these chakras are the ones

86
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,030
who cater to the need of any emergencies we have.

87
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,050
For example, if we have to run very fast,

88
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:14,080
we can run very fast.

89
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,210
Our heart starts beating, the sympathetic goes into action,

90
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:22,130
then these chakras bring it back to normal

91
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,030
by supplying proper energy

92
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:28,030
to that part which has been over-used.

93
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:30,060
They bring it back to normal.

94
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:35,220
When, say, on the left hand side and the right hand side

95
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,190
we have two extraction of the sympathetic nervous system.

96
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,110
When this extraction is too much on the chakras,

97
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,100
these chakras get separated

98
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,240
and there is a deity in every chakra.

99
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,130
And when that deity sleeps off,

100
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,170
there is a separation from the whole,

101
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,240
because that is how we are connected with the whole.

102
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:58,190
You see, supposing this is the vertebra, it's like this,

103
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,140
once it is broken off, you are broken off from the whole,

104
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,000
the control is lost.

105
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,020
Once the control is lost,

106
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:09,080
then you start working on your own.

107
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:13,000
Once a cell starts working on its own,

108
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,130
it becomes malignant.

109
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,110
It loses that relationship with the whole

110
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,100
which gives it balance,

111
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:21,170
a sense of proportion and coordination,

112
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,110
how much to grow, and that's how cancer is set in.

113
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:30,100
In the society, also, nowadays

114
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:33,110
because the society is becoming ego-oriented,

115
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,140
we go on saying, "What's wrong?

116
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:38,070
What's wrong in this, what's wrong in this?"

117
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:42,030
As today, just now Warren was telling you

118
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:45,030
that there is a dharma within us.

119
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:49,070
We have got ten dharmas, the ten sustainers within us,

120
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:52,020
the Ten Commandments that we have to obey. Why?

121
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,160
Because if you go out of them,

122
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,140
then you go into an imbalance.

123
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,080
And if the imbalance is set in,

124
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,240
then you can develop any one of these problems

125
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:05,050
which come out of the imbalances.

126
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:10,110
That is how we cannot cure cancer,

127
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:14,100
because we cannot make the cells

128
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,050
go back to its normal condition.

129
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,160
At the most what we can do is to remove the cells

130
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,080
from the body who start attacking others

131
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,220
and making them also ego-oriented.

132
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:32,220
But we cannot make them again normal cells.

133
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:37,000
Only through vibrations you can do it,

134
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,050
because when you vibrate these centres

135
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:40,170
they become more powerful,

136
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,080
they expand their aura

137
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,240
so the circle that was small becomes bigger,

138
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,210
engulfs both the sides and bring them together,

139
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,080
and again the deities are awakened

140
00:07:54,170 --> 00:08:00,100
and the cells start getting the message from the whole.

141
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,130
This is a simple principle, which is a subtle principle,

142
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:06,180
but a person who gets a cancer,

143
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,160
how will he know he's got a cancer or not?

144
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,140
Because there is no way of knowing it.

145
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,210
But when you become the knowledge,

146
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:20,070
you start developing the sensation on your fingers

147
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:25,180
and there are decoding words,

148
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,020
decoding language which tells you

149
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,240
which are the centres catching and how to cure it.

150
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,130
Immediately you are on the alert,

151
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:35,010
because you know it's happening.

152
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:41,180
Now people who have, say, mental problem,

153
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,120
they don't know they have mental problem.

154
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:46,120
Some of them, they are not at all aware of it.

155
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,060
but then they realize they have a mental problem.

156
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:51,150
A psychiatrist came to see Me,

157
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:54,070
today only he was with Me,

158
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,200
he is a Sahaja Yogi and he treated some mentally

159
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,240
handicapped person. He's a psychiatrist,

160
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:07,000
so he finds always this finger shakes before Me, you see -

161
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,110
this finger and this thumb.

162
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:14,090
If this is burning and this is shaking

163
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,110
that means there's a possession working on you -

164
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,000
a simple thing like that.

165
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:24,000
Now this person can clear it out because Sahaja Yogi,

166
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,020
takes hardly two minutes to clear it out.

167
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,130
But the person who has got it can be also cleared out,

168
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,170
because once you know what is the centre,

169
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:34,110
and if you know the deities whom to awaken,

170
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,110
and if you know how to awaken them,

171
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,170
you get it cleared out.

172
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,170
That's how mad people can also get cured.

173
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,130
Now here there's a madman on the road,

174
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,060
just now when he was speaking I was in the room,

175
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,090
he was saying, "You must seek Christ, you must seek God"

176
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:54,060
and all those things on the street.

177
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:57,090
He is himself mad, you see. A mad leading others into what,

178
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:59,110
a lunatic asylum?

179
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:01,020
He's talking like that loudly,

180
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:04,050
"You must seek Lord, you must seek God."

181
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,090
How? How do you seek?

182
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,140
Just giving lectures, "Seek the Lord, seek gods"

183
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,190
- is this the way?

184
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:17,090
If I say, “Now put your attention inside" -

185
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,010
Just now you are sitting in front of Me;

186
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:21,060
a simple thing, your attention is towards Me,

187
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:24,060
now turn your attention inside. Can you do it?

188
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,130
You may say, "Yes we are doing it."

189
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,020
That's wrong; that you are not doing, at all.

190
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:31,220
Something has to happen within.

191
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,190
Unless and until something happens

192
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,120
your attention cannot go inside.

193
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,200
Many people just believe into something false,

194
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:44,080
go on believing into it till they suffer from it.

195
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:49,080
I've seen people who have been like that. Fanatics.

196
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,140
In their old age they become,

197
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:55,120
absolutely either violent people or useless

198
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,190
or aggressive or boring.

199
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,090
Some of them become really half mad,

200
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,050
and some of them full mads.

201
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:08,050
So believing into anything without the knowledge about it

202
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:11,090
is a very blind game.

203
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,160
Now sustenance has to be there.

204
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:19,080
Now we can say in India we have Sikhism

205
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:21,170
which is a very great religion.

206
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,170
But the people who belong to Sikhism

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,080
are not supposed to drink at all.

208
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,200
After all, Guru Nanaka when He said,

209
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:33,030
"You are not to drink," because He knew about it,

210
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,110
He knew what He was saying about it.

211
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:39,000
He was an incarnation of the Primordial Being.

212
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:41,060
He was the Primordial Master

213
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,080
and when He said that "You should not drink,"

214
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,230
now I'm told that in England the Sikh people drink

215
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:53,160
more than the, even the Scotland people.

216
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,170
It's most surprising.

217
00:11:57,030 --> 00:12:00,160
Imagine! Same about Islam because Mohammed Sahib

218
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:03,210
and Nanak Sahib are the same person, same persons,

219
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,220
He said the same thing.

220
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:08,160
Moses said the same thing, ask the Jews,

221
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,170
what are they doing?

222
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,190
He said, "Strong drinks, alcohols, all must be avoided."

223
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:16,110
At the time of Mohammed Sahib there were no cigarettes,

224
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:18,170
so He didn't say about cigarettes so Moslems say,

225
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,240
"Oh, cigarettes are all right, it doesn't matter."

226
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,110
You see these things are so, there are so many loopholes.

227
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,100
In India we have communities and communities like that,

228
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:33,050
where you go and see, you'll be amazed.

229
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:37,080
Like Jains, they won't eat meat but they will drink.

230
00:12:37,170 --> 00:12:38,160
Can you imagine?

231
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,030
Drinking goes against your awareness is a fact,

232
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:46,070
while Mahavira has talked about nothing but Chaitanya.

233
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,130
Buddha never said, "Don't eat meat."

234
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,040
That doesn't mean that you should eat meat,

235
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,240
but what I'm saying He never talked on that,

236
00:12:53,070 --> 00:12:54,100
that's not so important.

237
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,180
He Himself, Buddha Himself

238
00:12:58,030 --> 00:13:04,020
died because He ate a raw pork.

239
00:13:04,130 --> 00:13:08,050
He went to a house, you see Buddha was a realized soul,

240
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:10,220
a great personality, He was an incarnation

241
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:16,110
and He went into a house where, as a guest.

242
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,070
Suddenly He appeared there,

243
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:21,160
and the person was just a hunter

244
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,100
and he said, "Oh Buddha, You have come to my house,

245
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:26,050
what should I give You, what should I do?" He said,

246
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:28,120
"I have very little time, whatever you have, you give me."

247
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:30,170
He said, "I've killed a wild boar,

248
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:33,080
but the food is still to be cooked and it will take some time."

249
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,060
He said, "All right, give Me half way."

250
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,120
And He died of that.

251
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:39,220
Even in Jainism, you'd be surprised,

252
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,150
that Naminath is the first one

253
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,220
who was the cousin of Shri Krishna.

254
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,000
In his marriage there was a big function

255
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:50,170
and lots of birds were bought -

256
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,110
I mean they were Jains, imagine.

257
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,130
And the birds and all that, when he saw so many killed,

258
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:59,050
he got a kind of a feeling against it and he said,

259
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:03,020
"All right, no more of this."

260
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,050
But they have gone to another extreme of vegetarianism,

261
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:08,030
I mean they can be very cruel themselves

262
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:11,190
but they don't mind that, they can be vegetarians,

263
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:14,140
to such an extent that you can't imagine.

264
00:14:15,210 --> 00:14:18,080
So this is the problem with the religion has been,

265
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,160
that you go to extreme of things.

266
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,040
First thing about religion is not to go to extremes,

267
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,130
that's the basis of every religion.

268
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,050
For Christianity you know Christ has said,

269
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,160
"Keep away the dead, have nothing to do with the dead,"

270
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,240
He took out the dead spirits and put them in the pigs

271
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:37,120
and put the pigs in the sea.

272
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,190
You all know that story,

273
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:41,040
but every church has got all the dead

274
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,200
lying under their feet.

275
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
You don't know how to walk in the church,

276
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:46,200
they're all lying down there.

277
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:50,120
Luckily I have been living or unluckily, I should say,

278
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,120
living next to the church all the time I've been in England,

279
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:56,160
and in the night I see all of them coming out of the graves,

280
00:14:57,010 --> 00:14:59,240
and I say, "Oh God." And here the children sit down,

281
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:01,160
pray to God and everything.

282
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:03,160
Now, what do they get?

283
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,160
No wonder Catholicism is bringing such a catastrophe,

284
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:09,150
or these so-called Christianity.

285
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:14,070
I mean the basics of every religion has been contradicted

286
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:16,180
by the disciples.

287
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:22,130
First Christ is the One Who controls the dead.

288
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:29,080
He's the One Who sucks the effects of the dead,

289
00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:34,130
and He absolutely banned them everywhere you go, any church.

290
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:36,070
Only in India they don't do it somehow,

291
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:38,030
I don't know how they have managed it.

292
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:41,080
But here every church you go there's dead bodies hanging there.

293
00:15:41,170 --> 00:15:44,200
Sahaja Yogis now don't go to church, because they are frightened.

294
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:47,070
Once a Sahaja Yogi is caught up by a spirit,

295
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,240
immediately he knows, he gets headache,

296
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,050
he doesn't want to go there.

297
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:53,190
But a person who is not a Sahaja Yogi, he goes to a church,

298
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,100
he catches the bhoot, he does not know.

299
00:15:56,210 --> 00:16:01,110
One of My disciples had a mother who was a Catholic lady,

300
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:05,160
very staunch Catholic, and she was MA in mathematics

301
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:08,220
and things like that, you see, and very staunch Catholic.

302
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:10,220
She came to see Me and I told her

303
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,210
that "You should give up all this fanaticism

304
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,110
about church-going, because in the church

305
00:16:16,190 --> 00:16:19,020
there are all these dead bodies placed there."

306
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,080
But she wouldn't listen to Me.

307
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,050
Now then after old age, about sixty years

308
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,020
they go mad actually, really,

309
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:28,240
and she started using her bidet for W.C.

310
00:16:29,050 --> 00:16:30,240
and all sorts of things, problems arose.

311
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,190
But she would get up in the morning of Sunday,

312
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:37,100
get ready and go to church and come back very nicely.

313
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:40,020
Every time it was a Sunday, she would get up,

314
00:16:40,110 --> 00:16:43,040
she would dress up well, go to church and come back.

315
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:46,220
As if somebody was taking her down there

316
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,100
and somebody was bringing her back.

317
00:16:50,190 --> 00:16:53,070
But one day it happened that she got lost,

318
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:56,020
and this lady telephoned to the police and said,

319
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:59,220
"What to do now, this lady is lost, and my mother is lost,"

320
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,010
and she got very worried. She telephoned to Me I said,

321
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,220
"You'll find her, she's all right, but she'll come back."

322
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:06,190
After three days she came from somewhere, God knows,

323
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:09,090
came back and again she started the same things,

324
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:11,110
using this for that, and that for that,

325
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,230
and absolutely like a mad person. But the police said,

326
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,200
"Nothing doing, now you’d better put her

327
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,070
in the old mad ones’ place."

328
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,180
So she put her in one of these places

329
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:22,210
where the old people live.

330
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:26,240
Now this Marie, My disciple she told Me it's most amazing,

331
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:30,150
the people who are there are mostly Catholics or Christians.

332
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,040
They are all mad like this,

333
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,090
the nurses are having a bad time,

334
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:36,130
but all of them get ready on a Sunday

335
00:17:36,210 --> 00:17:40,040
and go to a church which is specially made for them.

336
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:42,160
Can you imagine?

337
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:47,230
Just look at this obsession,

338
00:17:48,130 --> 00:17:50,100
it's an obsession with us,

339
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,130
we must know these are obsessions,

340
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:56,020
we are not free people; we are slaves to these things.

341
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,180
Now once you come to this side,

342
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:03,120
the other side of slavery are our habits, they enslave us.

343
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,070
They enslave us, I have seen now people,

344
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,230
we once had a minister sitting with Me

345
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,160
and a Russian minister, very powerful man otherwise.

346
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:19,100
And suddenly he got up, he was the host,

347
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:20,240
suddenly he got up, "Oh I must go."

348
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,030
I said, "What happened?"

349
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:24,190
He said, "I am a sick man." I said, "What's the matter with you?"

350
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:28,000
"You see, I am a football fan and I can't sit any longer,

351
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,240
the football match must have started."

352
00:18:30,070 --> 00:18:32,110
Imagine, he was the chief host,

353
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,020
and so many people were there, he just couldn't sit.

354
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:38,110
I mean, he could not glue himself to the chair

355
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:40,020
and he wanted to get up and walk,

356
00:18:40,110 --> 00:18:42,110
and he just didn't know what to do.

357
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,130
I was amazed, he had no poise, no control over himself,

358
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,210
I mean I just thought must be some possession

359
00:18:48,030 --> 00:18:51,100
from this football is coming to him, or what is it?

360
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,180
But such a grown - up, matured person behaves like this!

361
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:58,180
This is nothing, other habits that we have are much worse,

362
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:01,100
are much worse and they all enslave us,

363
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,010
we can't live without them.

364
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:05,210
Anything that is in this world is for us,

365
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,150
we are not for anything.

366
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:09,100
If anything can enslave us,

367
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,190
we should know that we are the masters of everything.

368
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:16,150
If a chair doesn't make you

369
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,150
comfortable or uncomfortable,

370
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:22,010
it's not important.

371
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:25,180
What is important is that this doesn't enslave you.

372
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,120
Nothing should enslave you.

373
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:30,060
The one who is a king, who is the emperor,

374
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,090
is least bothered.

375
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,240
If you put that person on the street, he'll sleep well.

376
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:37,040
If you put him anywhere he'll be happy,

377
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,100
that's the person is the real emperor.

378
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:42,190
But not the emperor who cannot live without

379
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:45,020
complete comfort.

380
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:49,040
If he's slave of the comfort, then he's not an emperor.

381
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,180
All these things we can learn

382
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:56,220
when our centre here, Nabhi Chakra, is awakened,

383
00:19:57,070 --> 00:20:00,130
when the light spreads in that area,

384
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,160
in the Void the green color you see,

385
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:07,180
then what happens immediately in that light

386
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,130
you don't see anything

387
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:11,110
but the light works.

388
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:14,110
Enlightenment is such that it goes into action,

389
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:17,080
the light itself acts, can you imagine?

390
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:20,110
The light itself act in you.

391
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,210
We had a doctor who was very fond of wine,

392
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,180
his drinks and all. I never tell you, "Don't drink."

393
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,130
I never say that, because I don't want people to run away.

394
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:29,220
No, no, nothing of the kind.

395
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:32,180
You sit down comfortably, just take your Realization,

396
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,080
then you'll see about it.

397
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:37,050
This fellow gave up his drinking next day,

398
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:40,120
but then he had to go to Germany, and he thought,

399
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:45,020
"I’d better try some special type of wine,"

400
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,210
that he had liked.

401
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:50,240
So he tried it and then he vomited, vomited, vomited,

402
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,130
couldn't bear. He said,

403
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:56,040
"The taste was so bad; I never tasted such a dirty thing."

404
00:20:56,110 --> 00:20:59,080
I never told him. It just happened.

405
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:03,020
He saved money, he could buy things out of the money

406
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:06,100
he saved and he was a free bird.

407
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,130
But I don't have to tell you this,

408
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:11,110
because we are so addicted and identified,

409
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,160
that even if you say that

410
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,210
"This can happen with Sahaja Yoga," many people will refuse.

411
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:22,080
Our identifications have gone so deeper into our beings,

412
00:21:22,150 --> 00:21:23,240
so deeper into our being,

413
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,070
our hangs-up, as we say, that we are not free people at all.

414
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:30,150
We might be free politically all right,

415
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,070
but this is so superficial.

416
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,110
The Spirit is the only thing that is free within,

417
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:41,070
which has no hangs-up, which has no habits,

418
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:43,010
which does not stick on to anything,

419
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:47,220
is completely detached and emitting joy to us.

420
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:50,240
It is a thing that makes our Spirit,

421
00:21:51,070 --> 00:21:53,150
our attention so enlightened.

422
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:56,110
Now enlightened attention, as I said,

423
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,190
is not the attention that we understand,

424
00:21:59,030 --> 00:22:00,130
that "There's a light, we see the light,"

425
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,170
nothing of the kind.

426
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,060
But with this enlightened attention

427
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,240
our awareness becomes enlightened,

428
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:09,240
so that we start feeling other people on our hands.

429
00:22:10,070 --> 00:22:11,220
Like the other person here sitting yesterday

430
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:14,010
you must have seen.

431
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:25,120
The other day one gentleman was here and he told Me that

432
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:27,050
"Your energies are different from mine,"

433
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:28,210
nothing of the kind.

434
00:22:29,050 --> 00:22:30,120
If you have negative energies

435
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,010
for the time being you will shake,

436
00:22:32,070 --> 00:22:33,230
definitely you will shake for a while, no doubt,

437
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,240
if you have too much negative energies.

438
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,070
Like once we had a program

439
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:42,080
and some people were there, some Brahmins,

440
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,130
and they were very much against Me

441
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:45,190
because I'm not a Brahmin.

442
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:48,020
They said, "We'll not have Mother's program."

443
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,050
I didn't know all these stories, they never told Me,

444
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:53,020
but they came before Me and started shaking like this,

445
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,150
so I said, "Why are you shaking so much?"

446
00:22:56,010 --> 00:22:58,130
They said, "We are Brahmins and we understand

447
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,050
You are Shakti, so we are shaking."

448
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,150
I said, "But why are you shaking? Nobody is shaking here."

449
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,100
So they pointed out to other four people,

450
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,050
they said, "See, they are also shaking."

451
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:08,150
So I said, "Go and find out from where do they come."

452
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:13,010
They went and found out that they came from lunatic asylum.

453
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:18,150
I said, "Relatively you should see who are shaking and

454
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,160
who are these people, nobody else."

455
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:24,230
So if there are negative forces you do shake a little bit.

456
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,100
But we should see again what's the use,

457
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:33,230
what's the use of getting this energy within us?

458
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,070
That is very important because we are

459
00:23:36,150 --> 00:23:41,080
utility-oriented people. Everything must have an utility,

460
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,190
as it is what do we have which has utility in this world?

461
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,190
Nothing.

462
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:51,020
If we had something which had real utility

463
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:54,200
we would not hanker after anything else.

464
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,100
The hankering is still on.

465
00:23:58,190 --> 00:24:01,100
So we should conclude that whatever we have got now

466
00:24:01,190 --> 00:24:03,190
is not the ultimate.

467
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,150
The utility of the ultimate is that

468
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:10,100
once you get the ultimate, everything becomes relative,

469
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:14,020
everything becomes relative.

470
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:18,020
That is, what becomes relative

471
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,230
is all these changing things,

472
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,160
all those things which are perishable,

473
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:28,050
all those things which try to enslave us,

474
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:31,150
all those things they’re attracted outwardly,

475
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,240
but inside they are like snakes,

476
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:38,070
and what we become is a detached personality.

477
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:45,130
(Mother is speaking Hindi: There is some problem putting)

478
00:24:55,180 --> 00:25:01,140
Now, our idea about any

479
00:25:04,090 --> 00:25:06,090
understanding about religion

480
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:11,030
is that we go to a limited church and a limited society,

481
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:13,080
a limited club, do exactly the same,

482
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,200
wear the same sort of dresses, wear the same sort of cap

483
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:19,200
or things we belong to one religion.

484
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,120
There is nothing like that, it's all manmade,

485
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,220
you see it's all artificial.

486
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:27,200
Whatever is manmade is artificial you know that.

487
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,220
They write it down also for

488
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,150
all the clothes that are made by man,

489
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,060
they said "manmade material," so it is not God- made,

490
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:41,200
it’s we have made our own religions and we are fighting for it.

491
00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:45,000
The religions are something within yourself,

492
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:47,170
within your being.

493
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,140
It has nothing to do with what sort of nonsense

494
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:53,170
we have made out of it.

495
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:56,140
This is the quality of a person,

496
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,190
like carbon has got four valencies,

497
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,030
you have got these ten valencies.

498
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:06,040
And if these valencies are missing then what happens,

499
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,000
that as in the combination of chemical combinations

500
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,110
you have seen, if one valency is missing,

501
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,060
then it becomes a negative,

502
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,080
and then it combines with another

503
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,000
so there are negative and positive valencies.

504
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,020
So if you have some additional valencies with you,

505
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,210
then you will jump onto other people;

506
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:26,020
if you have less, then you catch some other people.

507
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:30,130
It's exactly the same as it happens in a chemical compound.

508
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:34,040
Now these valencies within us are to be there to give us a balance,

509
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:37,190
and that's what Warren has told you what it means.

510
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:42,000
When you get your Realization, your dharma,

511
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,240
your Ten Commandments get enlightened.

512
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,000
Means you get empowered,

513
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:50,220
you become that.

514
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:53,040
You go beyond religion.

515
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:56,000
You don't have to follow anybody, you just become.

516
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,000
You become so integrated.

517
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,050
For example,

518
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:03,190
some people it doesn't suit to have, say, potatoes,

519
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:07,050
they will just don't like it, just don't like it.

520
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,110
Before Realization it is just the other way round,

521
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,230
if they are not suppose to eat potatoes,

522
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:12,230
they'll eat potatoes more.

523
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:15,120
After Realization, you won't just have it,

524
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,220
you won't have it, you are so integrated.

525
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:24,010
The sustenance within us gets so enlightened

526
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,030
that our priorities change completely;

527
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:30,040
we start judging everything on vibrations.

528
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:34,110
Now, we have a little girl you have seen, Olympia,

529
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,010
she eats very little,

530
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,150
practically solid food she does not eat.

531
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:42,110
But if I give her anything to eat, she will eat,

532
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,220
from nobody else; but if I give her anything

533
00:27:45,030 --> 00:27:47,080
she'll ask for more and eat it.

534
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,010
It's surprising, she understands vibrations.

535
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:55,180
If you understand vibrations

536
00:27:56,010 --> 00:28:00,230
then it is very easy to retain your valencies intact,

537
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,040
because you are empowered.

538
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,090
Not only that, but you just don't like anything else

539
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:09,060
because you like the vibrations to flow.

540
00:28:09,150 --> 00:28:11,000
When the vibrations are flowing,

541
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:13,010
the Spirit is emitting

542
00:28:13,090 --> 00:28:17,080
through your central nervous system ‘the joy’

543
00:28:17,170 --> 00:28:20,120
that is the quality of your Spirit.

544
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,090
The joy you start feeling,

545
00:28:22,170 --> 00:28:25,170
and when you start feeling the joy,

546
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:29,050
then you don't want to give up. For anything you

547
00:28:29,130 --> 00:28:32,010
just don't want to give up, you want to enjoy it.

548
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:34,150
So you become the knowledge,

549
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,100
and the attention which is actually placed in this area

550
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,160
and sustained by your liver, becomes enlightened.

551
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,100
As I told you yesterday, sitting down here,

552
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,160
if you want to feel

553
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,130
about anyone you can find out.

554
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,220
Like just now I saw one gentleman

555
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,090
sitting a little awkwardly, I thought,

556
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:55,140
he is not sitting properly, I said, "Sit properly."

557
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:57,080
But then I paid attention to him,

558
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,220
I knew he is not well so I said, "Have you got any problem?"

559
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,160
He said, "Yes." I said, "Then it is all right."

560
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:07,170
So with attention you immediately understand a person,

561
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:09,220
what's the problem with that person is.

562
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:13,080
Sitting down here you can find out the vibrations of anyone.

563
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,050
For example now we can say -

564
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:19,020
if there is no Russian! - that

565
00:29:20,090 --> 00:29:23,000
(should I say or not?)

566
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,050
Brezhnev is possessed.

567
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,040
He is a possessed man just now.

568
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,020
I'm going to Russia, I hope I'll take out his possessions.

569
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,150
He's a possessed man.

570
00:29:33,220 --> 00:29:38,050
They are dealing in these parapsychology,

571
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,180
same in America it's going to happen,

572
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:42,070
it is going to happen everywhere

573
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:46,150
where you try to practice these spirit,

574
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,150
spiritualists and all that what we call preta vidya,

575
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:53,070
smashana vidya and all that

576
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:56,050
which is absolutely horrible things,

577
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,110
calling them with sophisticated names

578
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,240
like “parapsychology” and calling, by

579
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,100
what other names they call it? -

580
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:05,150
charismatic movements and all sorts.

581
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,160
It's nothing but spirits,

582
00:30:09,030 --> 00:30:10,140
nothing but spirits.

583
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:14,080
All these people are practicing nothing but spirits.

584
00:30:14,170 --> 00:30:16,170
They bring out these dead spirits

585
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,190
and call it the Holy Ghost, imagine?

586
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,000
This charismatic movement is another horrible thing,

587
00:30:27,090 --> 00:30:28,220
I don't know how to tell you about it,

588
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:31,140
but I must say that the whole science

589
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,080
has become so subtle that nobody knows that

590
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:38,170
this is the scorpious, horrible, satanic force

591
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,090
that is working through us and attracting

592
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:43,140
us to these spirits.

593
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,000
Some people said,

594
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,090
"Mother there are good spirits and bad spirits."

595
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,070
But why, why, why go to the dead?

596
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,020
You don't know which is good and which is bad.

597
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,120
How will you know, why go to the dead?

598
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:57,230
We have to be in the present,

599
00:30:58,060 --> 00:30:59,240
we don't have to be in the past.

600
00:31:00,070 --> 00:31:01,130
So that's one thing happens

601
00:31:01,210 --> 00:31:04,130
when you lose your valencies, that you go to the left.

602
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,240
When you go to the right, you may be very austere,

603
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,230
you don't eat that food, that food, and this and that,

604
00:31:14,060 --> 00:31:16,060
you may become a very ego-oriented person.

605
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:19,150
You go to another side, called supraconscious,

606
00:31:20,010 --> 00:31:21,120
the collective supraconscious.

607
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:23,230
The left side is the collective subconscious

608
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,170
and the right side is the collective supraconscious.

609
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,100
When I started My work

610
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:32,050
I decided not to talk about these dead spirits.

611
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,190
I said, "I'll manage without that."

612
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,080
But it's not possible. For three years I never talked about it.

613
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,190
I didn't talk about the deities,

614
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,050
I didn't talk about anything.

615
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:43,000
For three years I managed it,

616
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,210
but then among us a lady came who was practicing

617
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,020
all these things, and she possessed so many people.

618
00:31:50,100 --> 00:31:52,180
And thousands of people used to go to her.

619
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:57,210
She would tell them which horse will come first,

620
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,190
where is the money lost.

621
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,150
All sorts of things,

622
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,190
and thousands of people used to throng, you know.

623
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:10,100
Here we have so few people but let some tantrika come in

624
00:32:10,210 --> 00:32:15,100
you won't be able to control your traffic.

625
00:32:15,190 --> 00:32:16,180
This will be the condition,

626
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,180
with any one of these horrible people coming in.

627
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:25,050
And this lady really made Me talk of these things

628
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,180
and that's what it is. They exist.

629
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,240
So going to the left or to the right,

630
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:33,100
you go into a problem,

631
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:36,150
because you enter into an unknown area

632
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,190
which is very dangerous, very dangerous.

633
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:46,180
For your information cancer is caused by left side movement.

634
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,220
I've not seen one patient of cancer

635
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,240
who has had no such experiences.

636
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,070
For example, these fake gurus,

637
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:57,130
or these initiation by this horrible people,

638
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:00,240
or reading the books of these left sided things

639
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:04,050
like what's his name, Rampa Sampa,

640
00:33:04,130 --> 00:33:05,210
and all these so-called Buddhists:

641
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:09,160
any one of these things can cause cancer.

642
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:13,210
And recently I saw a very good film on this,

643
00:33:14,050 --> 00:33:17,160
by your television here, English television.

644
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,040
They showed where some doctors had made

645
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:24,160
an investigation and they said that they have seen

646
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,110
that the cancer is triggered by some proteins

647
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,020
which they recognize;

648
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:32,220
they call them as 52 - protein 52,

649
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,180
58 - that's the name they give.

650
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,150
But they recognized that they are coming

651
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,180
from the area which is built within us since our creation.

652
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:44,080
So it is the collective subconscious,

653
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,150
and they have pictured also, photographed.

654
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:53,200
So now, though I mean what I have said about ten years back,

655
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:54,200
they are saying now.

656
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,130
But they are reaching that point

657
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:58,050
they have to just cross the limit.

658
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,220
They have to just get their Realization,

659
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:06,000
and because the doctors cannot reach that area themselves,

660
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:09,020
they cannot cure cancer, at the most they may stop it,

661
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,140
they may try to reduce the possibilities and all that,

662
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,170
but complete cure they cannot give,

663
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,220
because they cannot extract people

664
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:20,000
from that area altogether.

665
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,030
They can always be drawn into it,

666
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:25,130
if that area is made like this.

667
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,000
It's very interesting to see

668
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,060
how these things are caused within us.

669
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:36,130
This centre is one of the most important centre

670
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,220
because it gives us our seeking,

671
00:34:39,050 --> 00:34:43,220
and our pure seeking should be for Spirit, for nothing else.

672
00:34:44,050 --> 00:34:46,230
But those people who go wrong,

673
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:52,080
all that you see in such people

674
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:56,000
who have bent their forehead before wrong people,

675
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:58,110
they develop a ridge on their head

676
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:02,030
and there are eleven centres here which just come up,

677
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,100
like a ridge.

678
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:05,230
And these are the eleven centres called as

679
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:11,120
Ekadesha Rudras which are responsible for the destruction,

680
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,190
the ultimate destruction.

681
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,100
The Kalki as called as, or what you call the Matreya

682
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:19,130
or the coming Christ

683
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,040
on the white horse.

684
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,150
That ridge once set in,

685
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,020
it starts developing more and more,

686
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,160
and destruction is near.

687
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,210
I must say from the unconscious many people get ideas.

688
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:37,150
I've seen people drawing or showing some pictures

689
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:40,050
where they show a very devilish person

690
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:44,020
with a horrible this thing coming out and a squarish thing.

691
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:48,100
I don't know how they get these ideas, but that's a fact.

692
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:55,040
Now the destructive forces are also on action.

693
00:35:55,130 --> 00:35:57,180
They are also working out their forces,

694
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:01,160
we have to be very careful, we are very precariously placed.

695
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:05,180
Formerly if you had gone too much to the left and right,

696
00:36:06,030 --> 00:36:09,070
you would have been not so badly off,

697
00:36:09,110 --> 00:36:11,050
and people didn't care also so much.

698
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:14,050
But today you are so precariously placed

699
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:18,080
and you are so sensitive and vulnerable

700
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:21,240
that you have to be extremely careful.

701
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,100
The rate of destruction is set in very fast

702
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:30,190
and the rate of construction has to be set in much faster.

703
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,160
If you see along - I mean, when I see, what is constructive?

704
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,240
Nothing.

705
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,130
If you read in the newspaper morning till evening

706
00:36:39,210 --> 00:36:41,000
one good news will come,

707
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:44,110
that the princess has delivered a beautiful boy.

708
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,190
The rest is horrifying.

709
00:36:47,030 --> 00:36:49,190
You ask them to publish something nice,

710
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:51,190
I told them to publish about Sahaja Yoga,

711
00:36:52,020 --> 00:36:53,040
they are not interested.

712
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,190
They are interested if there's a mishap, an accident,

713
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:57,130
some people died, some people killed,

714
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,100
they want to put all these photographs

715
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:02,160
of how the people were killed and what wars took place,

716
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,050
this and that.

717
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:07,160
They have no time for some good news.

718
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,240
Some good message, something of hope, they don't want it.

719
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,240
That's how you see any organization

720
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:18,050
that is working out today,

721
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,050
how they are building up ego-oriented organization.

722
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:24,100
Every even charity organizations

723
00:37:24,190 --> 00:37:27,170
are nothing but ego-oriented ones.

724
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:31,170
I have, Myself, been with many organizations like that

725
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,100
and worked with them. I was amazed!

726
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:35,140
These people had no charity in them.

727
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,160
Charity is something that should come as compassion,

728
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:40,190
should just flow from you,

729
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,200
but it is some sort of a camouflage

730
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:48,210
for earning better position or a better status,

731
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:51,080
and all nonsense going on.

732
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,030
A person who is charitable is actually a person

733
00:37:56,090 --> 00:37:58,050
who just flows.

734
00:37:58,140 --> 00:38:00,170
Who is the other to be charitable?

735
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,140
If they are the part and parcel of Me,

736
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,000
whom am I going to be charitable?

737
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,200
If this finger is paining,

738
00:38:09,030 --> 00:38:11,120
am I going to be charitable to this finger?

739
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:15,200
I must look after it, jolly well, because it's paining Me;

740
00:38:16,090 --> 00:38:18,060
I have to do rubbing of it, whatever is necessary,

741
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,150
I have to do it.

742
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:22,010
And that's what people don't understand.

743
00:38:22,090 --> 00:38:29,110
All this kind of our facade will one day fall down,

744
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,230
and we'll find out that we have been wasting our energy

745
00:38:34,070 --> 00:38:38,000
over something very, very trivial.

746
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:42,180
Actually the all-pervading Power does everything.

747
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:46,170
We do not do anything, believe Me, we do not do anything.

748
00:38:47,030 --> 00:38:52,090
How many flowers are turning into fruits just now?

749
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:54,170
Who is doing that job?

750
00:38:55,010 --> 00:39:00,010
How many seeds are sprouting at this moment, just now?

751
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:02,230
Who is doing all that?

752
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,010
How many children are born at this moment?

753
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:12,230
In the human body, no foreign matter can stay,

754
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,120
no foreign matter.

755
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,200
It tries always to expel it,

756
00:39:17,030 --> 00:39:19,200
but when it comes to fetus,

757
00:39:20,110 --> 00:39:24,040
not that the body only keeps it there, but sustains it,

758
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:27,000
nurtures it, looks after it, makes it grow,

759
00:39:27,090 --> 00:39:31,010
and when the right time’s come, it throws out.

760
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,030
Who does that?

761
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:36,000
We take everything for granted.

762
00:39:36,060 --> 00:39:37,230
Take our eyes, if you are a doctor,

763
00:39:38,070 --> 00:39:41,150
you can see what an intricate thing has been created as eyes,

764
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,080
that we see people through these eyes.

765
00:39:44,170 --> 00:39:47,120
Who has done all that? Have we done it?

766
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,040
Can we make even one eye?

767
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:52,220
And then we see so many different type of eye.

768
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,120
This is the compassion of God, this is the power of God

769
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,000
that is all-pervading.

770
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,140
First time when you get Realization, first time,

771
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,080
you feel that compassion,

772
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,150
you feel those vibrations,

773
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:11,030
you feel that all-pervading Power.

774
00:40:11,150 --> 00:40:15,170
You can now know that the all-pervading Power is there

775
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,150
and then you can see the maneuvering of it.

776
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:20,110
You can work it out, you can work it out.

777
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,090
Use it; you are the instrument, as I said.

778
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,120
You are the master, only you have to become,

779
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:30,010
assume that power.

780
00:40:31,110 --> 00:40:33,220
Warren, I hope, has told you how he came to Me.

781
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,030
I don't know if he has told you,

782
00:40:35,110 --> 00:40:37,140
he just came with a phone call.

783
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,000
He had My phone number,

784
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,230
and the person who sent him gave a big idea about Me,

785
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:45,120
that “She’s not available,” this is that and all - all nonsense,

786
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,230
I'm the most available person.

787
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,230
He just called Me, and I said “Come along.”

788
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,170
He came to My house and he got his realization.

789
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:57,010
and now in Australia he's transformed so many people,

790
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:01,000
we have ashrams in seven cities of Australia.

791
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:04,150
England is the most lethargic, I must say.

792
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,060
Seven cities of Australia are now there, ready to get it,

793
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:13,150
there are so many people working it out

794
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,220
because once you get the light, you give it to others.

795
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:24,080
So now we move to another centre above that,

796
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,150
is the centre of the Mother of the Universe.

797
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:33,150
The father resides in this centre, previous centre,

798
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:38,000
the Nabhi Chakra and rises above and then settles down

799
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,170
onto the right side,

800
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:44,220
this is the fatherhood.

801
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:48,040
Say a gentleman yesterday told Me that

802
00:41:48,140 --> 00:41:50,120
he had trouble with his asthma.

803
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:54,030
I don't know if he's come back or not, is he here?

804
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,190
Yes, good. Now, this gentleman has asthma.

805
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,130
Of course I told him that he had trouble

806
00:42:01,210 --> 00:42:04,100
because of too much bathing systems of India,

807
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:07,180
Indians you see, we bathe too much, apart from that

808
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,130
it comes from the father's grief.

809
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:14,120
His father had died, and the father himself

810
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,020
is not willing to leave him, he is worried about him.

811
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:21,010
It can happen to any one of us,

812
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:23,210
if a man is unkind to his son,

813
00:42:24,070 --> 00:42:25,220
it's a father principle.

814
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:30,190
If the son is unkind to the father, so the father is hurt.

815
00:42:31,050 --> 00:42:35,050
It's the father principle, if it is disturbed by any chance

816
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:40,050
or if suddenly father dies and you feel the pinch of that

817
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,130
all your life, all that can work out here,

818
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:46,070
and you get this right heart catch.

819
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,210
With that you get asthma.

820
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:51,050
It is said that in homeopathy

821
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,120
they believe that with more tension you get it,

822
00:42:53,190 --> 00:42:55,080
because wheneverr we are more tensed, you see,

823
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,020
you remember your father.

824
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:58,200
If he was here he would have helped you.

825
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:01,010
In the subconscious sometimes it works out.

826
00:43:01,090 --> 00:43:04,090
And that’s how it adds to the problem.

827
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:09,010
It is so simple to work out,

828
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:13,170
that you'd be amazed that if you have to just raise

829
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:16,140
the principle of father in a person like that -

830
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,110
who might be a dejected father,

831
00:43:18,170 --> 00:43:20,040
who might be a cruel father,

832
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,010
who might be a son who has lost a father, can be anything,

833
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:27,110
that you have to just put your hand on that part,

834
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:35,110
and just say a mantra, a chanting

835
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:40,080
which will raise or which will awaken the fatherhood

836
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:43,140
in a full bloom, and you get cured,

837
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,190
it's very simple.

838
00:43:46,030 --> 00:43:49,220
The centre Heart is governed by the Mother of the Universe.

839
00:43:50,090 --> 00:43:53,160
She gives us the sense of security.

840
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:56,210
When you are at the age of twelve years, you see,

841
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:02,190
the bone that is in front here

842
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:08,210
starts emitting antibodies,

843
00:44:09,050 --> 00:44:10,210
it creates antibodies within

844
00:44:11,050 --> 00:44:12,120
you till the age of twelve years

845
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:16,130
and then these antibodies are really the soldiers

846
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:18,160
of the Mother of the Universe.

847
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:21,130
We call Her Jagadamba in Sanskrit language,

848
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:24,130
and they spread to the whole of the body

849
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,160
and wherever there is an attack,

850
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,080
they inform each other and they fight it out.

851
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:32,240
These antibodies are created in the sternum bone

852
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:36,080
in the front side of the,

853
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:40,070
we can say, the ribs, where the ribs meet,

854
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:44,080
thoracic region, that part,

855
00:44:44,170 --> 00:44:50,050
they stay there, are created till the age of twelve years.

856
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:54,000
Now what happens in ladies specially,

857
00:44:54,110 --> 00:44:56,120
they are the mothers also,

858
00:44:56,220 --> 00:45:00,090
when their motherhood is challenged, they get a problem.

859
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,060
Like a woman, say her husband is a flirt,

860
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:07,110
he has a roving eyes sort of a thing, and she is insecure.

861
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,010
Then this motherhood is challenged,

862
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:15,090
and when it is challenged, she gets a problem there,

863
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:20,220
and she gets, then she gets a disease of the breast,

864
00:45:21,050 --> 00:45:22,120
breast cancer and all that

865
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:26,030
is caused by the insecurity of a woman.

866
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,160
If a woman is insecure, she may be with any reason insecure,

867
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,160
she gets this breast cancer.

868
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:39,020
There was a girl who was married,

869
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:42,220
she was married to a Catholic or someone like that,

870
00:45:43,050 --> 00:45:44,160
and there was a inter-religion marriage,

871
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:48,190
and the people of the boy's side tried to trouble her a lot.

872
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:52,190
It's very common in India, but here also I it see it is so.

873
00:45:53,110 --> 00:45:56,130
And they tried to sort of say these things to them,

874
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:59,230
that thing to her and to her parents and things like that,

875
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:03,050
and she developed this insecurity within her heart,

876
00:46:03,220 --> 00:46:06,220
that she developed breast cancer.

877
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,020
Now when we are cruel to others,

878
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,110
we don't know we are giving them cancers.

879
00:46:13,050 --> 00:46:16,220
What does it take for us to be kind to a girl who's married

880
00:46:17,050 --> 00:46:19,060
in our family, who has come to us?

881
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:23,240
We are experts in saying things that hurt others.

882
00:46:24,130 --> 00:46:27,140
We learn from childhood how to talk to people

883
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:29,130
so that they are really hurt.

884
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,030
By hurting them, we give them cancers.

885
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:38,060
But this only one realizes when you get your Realization.

886
00:46:39,020 --> 00:46:40,170
Then you really understand

887
00:46:41,030 --> 00:46:44,000
that how much a person is suffering,

888
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:47,090
because you also feel a little pain there,

889
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,130
your whole style of talking, your whole style of behaviour,

890
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,140
of commuting with others completely changes.

891
00:46:57,060 --> 00:46:59,030
This centre is very important.

892
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:03,160
On the left hand side is the mother's side,

893
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:07,180
and the mother itself is - if the mother is a lunatic,

894
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:09,180
you get a problem there.

895
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:11,210
You might get it, we call it a Heart,

896
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,020
there are two Hearts,

897
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:16,130
one is the Heart of the Spirit and one is the Heart Chakra.

898
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,160
If a mother is a fanatic,

899
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:22,130
she is a woman who is very fanatic about her food,

900
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,010
things like that, then the children get it.

901
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:28,020
It's a dangerous thing to play with children like that,

902
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,180
to have complete discipline on the children

903
00:47:31,010 --> 00:47:33,220
and just keep them, "Must walk straight like a horse,

904
00:47:34,070 --> 00:47:35,100
put two things that"

905
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:37,150
Children should be allowed to have their freedom.

906
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,190
Actually when we suppress them too much,

907
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:42,210
they become hooligans. That way Indians are better,

908
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:44,100
they know how to bring up their children.

909
00:47:44,190 --> 00:47:47,130
They allow their children to have all the freedom.

910
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,050
Just give them the idea of dignity,

911
00:47:50,150 --> 00:47:53,100
and when the children are so free with the parents

912
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:56,050
in childhood, by the time they are about four or five

913
00:47:56,130 --> 00:47:58,220
they become extremely dignified.

914
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:01,240
Like I see the children saying the words like,

915
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:05,100
"Get out, get away." From where do they learn these words?

916
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:09,070
They learn it from their parents, or learn it from friends,

917
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,040
or someone they must be learning,

918
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:14,120
because these words are normally not spoken by children.

919
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,050
"Get lost." I've seen a little child saying that -

920
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:21,100
"Get lost." I mean it is too much to say to someone.

921
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:22,240
But it happens like that,

922
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:26,040
because we do not understand

923
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:29,020
what we should talk before the children, how decently.

924
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:31,120
We may be most indecent people, doesn't matter.

925
00:48:31,190 --> 00:48:33,150
We might be absolutely rotten people,

926
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:37,050
even a dacoit knows that he should behave properly

927
00:48:37,130 --> 00:48:39,240
before his children, because children will become dacoits.

928
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:43,210
Even a prostitutes, even a prostitute will understand that

929
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:45,160
she should not behave in a manner

930
00:48:45,220 --> 00:48:48,080
that the child takes to prostitution.

931
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:49,190
It's a common sense,

932
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:52,080
that whatever we do the children take so easily,

933
00:48:52,150 --> 00:48:54,070
so whatever you want give them,

934
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,020
whatever you want to impart them,

935
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:58,220
that's how you should behave before them.

936
00:48:59,070 --> 00:49:03,020
But now as the society is today, people are not paying

937
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:05,080
so much attention to their children, at all.

938
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:09,180
They're so, I mean still the ladies are,

939
00:49:10,010 --> 00:49:12,150
the mothers are still like brides,

940
00:49:12,220 --> 00:49:14,240
you know busy finding new husbands.

941
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,150
Husbands are still like bridegrooms, finding new wives,

942
00:49:19,010 --> 00:49:21,150
and the children, poor things, don't know where to look.

943
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,180
God knows in what orphanage they have to end up their life.

944
00:49:25,010 --> 00:49:26,180
Even the industry is like that,

945
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,010
I wanted to buy yesterday a pure cotton frock

946
00:49:30,080 --> 00:49:32,100
for a little child, and couldn't find anywhere,

947
00:49:32,190 --> 00:49:35,120
not one frock I could get in the whole of Derbyshire

948
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,220
and also in London for your information,

949
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:40,120
which was pure cotton.

950
00:49:40,230 --> 00:49:42,190
I mean we don't think that children

951
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,040
can't bear this artificial manmade fiber.

952
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:47,130
It's very dangerous, it's very bad for their skin.

953
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,210
When you were young you used cotton.

954
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,210
You had mills of cotton here.

955
00:49:52,050 --> 00:49:54,160
And why give this horrible stuff to your children,

956
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:56,090
which you never had?

957
00:49:56,190 --> 00:49:58,050
By the time they grow up to your age

958
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,130
they will have all blotches on their faces. They'll be -

959
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:04,000
I don't know what diseases they may have on their skin.

960
00:50:04,150 --> 00:50:07,130
No one realizes this is the kind of panties you are using,

961
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,100
the kind of things you are using for them,

962
00:50:09,180 --> 00:50:10,220
it's very dangerous,

963
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:13,130
I don't know what's going to happen to them.

964
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,040
The things they are using,

965
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:18,080
you never used them when you were young, believe Me,

966
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:21,180
and these are the times when they really require

967
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,130
complete attention, and these are the times

968
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,240
when they are absolutely tortured.

969
00:50:28,100 --> 00:50:30,240
Even the industry is not worried about them.

970
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,220
Why not make some cotton clothes for little children?

971
00:50:34,070 --> 00:50:35,180
Actually, I would say that the government

972
00:50:36,010 --> 00:50:36,220
must pass a law that

973
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:39,130
"No children's clothes should be made

974
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:42,020
of any artificial things."

975
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,150
You can have the elders with that, it doesn't matter.

976
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,240
But for the young children,

977
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:48,080
you can't give them atomic bombs to wear.

978
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:50,190
This is too much and these modern times

979
00:50:51,020 --> 00:50:52,210
I think are the cruellest for children,

980
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,070
that's why very few children want to be born

981
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:56,210
in these advanced countries.

982
00:50:57,070 --> 00:50:59,210
We have to bear the load In India.

983
00:51:01,030 --> 00:51:02,140
If you are not kind to children

984
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,150
imagine, two children are killed by their parents,

985
00:51:04,210 --> 00:51:06,150
what sort of a society we have?

986
00:51:06,210 --> 00:51:08,140
Every week in London city itself

987
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,000
- I use to think in England,

988
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:12,030
but they told Me it's in London city

989
00:51:12,100 --> 00:51:13,210
- two children are killed by the parents,

990
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:18,030
and I have not heard a single case like that in India.

991
00:51:20,030 --> 00:51:21,180
With this cruelty towards children,

992
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:24,000
I don't know what women are up to.

993
00:51:24,090 --> 00:51:26,060
Where are they going to take their figures

994
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:30,090
and their beauties and everything in front of God?

995
00:51:32,060 --> 00:51:36,190
Such cruelty exists, such self-centreedness,

996
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,060
then with all this the children develop

997
00:51:39,140 --> 00:51:42,030
this struggle and they have palpitations, and

998
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:44,060
they have very weak hearts.

999
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,090
They are in your trust,

1000
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:48,140
God has given you

1001
00:51:48,240 --> 00:51:54,080
such beautiful children that you should thank Him for that.

1002
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:58,060
They are not some surplus quantities have come to you;

1003
00:51:58,140 --> 00:52:01,090
it's a blessing to you that God has given you children.

1004
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:04,000
If one woman in India doesn't get a child,

1005
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,170
she will go and weep and ask every god

1006
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:11,080
and every prophet and everyone that she should get a child.

1007
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:13,170
While in Germany it is going

1008
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:16,090
toward minus five percent growth now.

1009
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,050
They pay to a woman who has five children

1010
00:52:19,130 --> 00:52:21,220
as much as the Prime Minister or even more than that,

1011
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:24,080
but she won't have, she' says, "I'll lose my figure."

1012
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:26,050
Where are you going to take these figures

1013
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,030
I don't understand.

1014
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,220
What are these figures for

1015
00:52:30,050 --> 00:52:32,080
and who's interested in your figures?

1016
00:52:33,170 --> 00:52:37,140
Why, why, why should we make ourselves so cheap?

1017
00:52:38,000 --> 00:52:40,190
We are mothers and we should be proud of our motherhood.

1018
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:43,200
Motherhood is the highest thing a woman can achieve.

1019
00:52:44,050 --> 00:52:45,200
I mean, I have achieved it,

1020
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:48,140
because I am a Mother for thousands.

1021
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,170
And I think that is the greatest thing

1022
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,140
that can happen to a woman is to be a mother.

1023
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:56,130
And Mother and a Guru, you can imagine My plight?

1024
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:00,020
It's much worse that you have to tell your children

1025
00:53:00,100 --> 00:53:03,020
something to be done, and you love them so much

1026
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:04,190
that you don't want to say that,

1027
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,030
then you have to play some little sweet tricks

1028
00:53:07,130 --> 00:53:09,060
with them to bring them round.

1029
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,110
It is such an interesting and a beautiful life

1030
00:53:12,190 --> 00:53:14,130
to be a mother, we should be proud mothers.

1031
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,020
But I would say the men too are to be blamed,

1032
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:19,030
because they are not interested in mothers,

1033
00:53:19,130 --> 00:53:21,080
they are interested in younger and younger girls

1034
00:53:21,170 --> 00:53:23,110
- is a sign of perversion I tell you,

1035
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:26,140
it is a sign of a complete perversion.

1036
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:29,220
At the time of Mohammed Sahib there were many,

1037
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:33,170
many women and very few men because so many were killed,

1038
00:53:34,050 --> 00:53:36,140
so Mohammed Sahib didn't know what to do.

1039
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,200
So He thought - they were pragmatic,

1040
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,130
as I told you yesterday that with the society

1041
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:42,080
one has be pragmatic - so He said, "All right,

1042
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,140
we have to have marriages," because

1043
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:49,080
without marriage any relationship of any kind is adharmic,

1044
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:52,020
is against the valencies.

1045
00:53:52,110 --> 00:53:54,000
So He said, "We must have marriage.

1046
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:56,110
All right, now we have many women

1047
00:53:56,190 --> 00:53:58,240
so let us have distribution of women

1048
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:00,140
according to the men we have.

1049
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:03,160
If you have more men then we'll have the other way around.

1050
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:05,020
But we have to marry,"

1051
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:09,000
means we have to take a collective sanction,

1052
00:54:09,110 --> 00:54:13,020
a collective sanction has to be there, to be blessed.

1053
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:15,130
So He said, "All right, marry five.”

1054
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,100
But He, Himself, you see, was surprised,

1055
00:54:18,150 --> 00:54:20,010
at time people were so sensitive,

1056
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,090
they would not marry young girls,

1057
00:54:21,150 --> 00:54:23,010
the old men would not marry young girls.

1058
00:54:23,070 --> 00:54:25,200
They said, "How can we marry these young girls?" you see.

1059
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:27,230
So He said, "No, all right, I'll marry one,

1060
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:29,150
because where will these young girls go,

1061
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:31,070
there are no young men left, so what to do?"

1062
00:54:31,150 --> 00:54:34,150
But these days, if you ask an old man of eighty years,

1063
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:38,150
he would be very willing to marry a girl of eighteen years.

1064
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,230
Stupid old fool I call him, because he doesn't understand.

1065
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:45,240
He doesn't understand that this girl

1066
00:54:46,070 --> 00:54:48,070
is not going to respect him as a husband

1067
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,150
and he cannot enjoy the life of a husband.

1068
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:53,210
He's a grandfather, or call it a great grandfather,

1069
00:54:54,070 --> 00:54:56,040
he should behave like a great grandfather;

1070
00:54:56,130 --> 00:54:57,230
that's an ideal relationship

1071
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,150
he should have with a young girl.

1072
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:04,040
All these ideals are confused today,

1073
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:05,230
our relationships with others.

1074
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:09,100
Every woman has to be attractive, why?

1075
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,160
Every man has to be attractive, why?

1076
00:55:11,230 --> 00:55:14,120
For what? What are you going to achieve out of it?

1077
00:55:15,210 --> 00:55:17,230
What is the utility?

1078
00:55:19,090 --> 00:55:20,150
Attractiveness is all right

1079
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:24,100
as long as you are not repulsive,

1080
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:29,090
as long as you keep the ideal relationship with others,

1081
00:55:29,210 --> 00:55:32,150
if the relationship becomes nothing but like a dog

1082
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,020
and bitch's one,

1083
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:37,100
it's better not to have this kind of an idea,

1084
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:41,070
it's absolutely wrong to run after something

1085
00:55:41,150 --> 00:55:42,180
which is not our way.

1086
00:55:43,020 --> 00:55:45,050
Human beings have to live with dignity

1087
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:48,140
and with complete sense of idealism

1088
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,200
as far as their relationship

1089
00:55:51,010 --> 00:55:55,040
with each other is concerned.

1090
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:58,070
If you just say, "What's wrong?"

1091
00:55:59,010 --> 00:56:01,180
then it's an argument, everything is wrong,

1092
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:02,230
and everything is wrong,

1093
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:06,090
it is not one wrong but all, everything is wrong.

1094
00:56:06,210 --> 00:56:10,150
But if you want to have a flowering society,

1095
00:56:11,030 --> 00:56:13,230
then you must keep to your ideals of your family life,

1096
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:15,120
that's a very important thing,

1097
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:18,030
but it happens to you as soon as you get Realization.

1098
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:21,210
I don't have to give a lecture on that. You just do it.

1099
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:24,240
You just become very nice husband

1100
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:28,010
and a very nice wife.

1101
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,000
Beautiful families can come out of Sahaja Yoga,

1102
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:34,170
there are so many, you'll see them.

1103
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:38,230
There are so many beautiful families now in Sahaja Yoga

1104
00:56:39,070 --> 00:56:41,170
and now the great children,

1105
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:44,200
the great sages who wanted to be born

1106
00:56:45,030 --> 00:56:46,150
are being born to them.

1107
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:49,090
Many great children want to be born in this England.

1108
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:51,100
And there are many who are born,

1109
00:56:51,210 --> 00:56:53,060
but I don't know how they are treated,

1110
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:54,150
if people understand them or not.

1111
00:56:54,240 --> 00:56:57,040
They have no vibrations to see if they are sages or not.

1112
00:56:57,150 --> 00:57:01,090
But born realized children are so many in England,

1113
00:57:02,030 --> 00:57:07,120
that I'm regretting sometimes the way they are treated.

1114
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:11,180
Nobody knows they are born realized - the way they talk,

1115
00:57:12,040 --> 00:57:14,140
they talk nothing but wisdom.

1116
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:18,100
All these children are being insulted and humiliated

1117
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,180
by us who are so ignorant about them.

1118
00:57:22,030 --> 00:57:24,010
I must say that they are very brave,

1119
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:26,080
they're very courageous to take birth

1120
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,150
in the countries where they are not appreciated

1121
00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:30,060
and looked after.

1122
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,140
Another extreme is in our country,

1123
00:57:32,220 --> 00:57:36,060
I should say, where people will sell their whole country

1124
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,030
for the sake of their children.

1125
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:40,190
I mean, that's going too far,

1126
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,110
that's another nonsense we do.

1127
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,200
But something in between is that you love your children,

1128
00:57:47,010 --> 00:57:50,090
respect them; they are your trust, they are realized souls,

1129
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,060
they are sages.

1130
00:57:52,140 --> 00:57:55,010
They are the foundations of the new world

1131
00:57:55,090 --> 00:57:56,170
that is going to come,

1132
00:57:57,010 --> 00:57:59,200
and this is what it is a mother has to learn.

1133
00:58:00,040 --> 00:58:02,230
The dignity of a mother must be respected.

1134
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:06,030
I'm sure you all must have respected your mothers very much.

1135
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:10,150
But now as mothers I don't know if you will be respected.

1136
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:15,030
Once this is established,

1137
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:19,140
that a mother itself is the highest position a woman

1138
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,200
can reach and she is to be respected,

1139
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,180
all the priorities will change among women also.

1140
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,120
Because what can they do?

1141
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:28,060
They have no place as mothers,

1142
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,180
so they just get fed up of their children, they think,

1143
00:58:31,010 --> 00:58:33,160
"What's the use of this motherhood? It's a thankless job."

1144
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:39,070
All this can only change when man changes within himself,

1145
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:41,060
when the transformation takes place.

1146
00:58:41,150 --> 00:58:43,210
Just now it is just a, one of the sermons

1147
00:58:44,050 --> 00:58:46,240
that you could hear somewhere in a very,

1148
00:58:47,210 --> 00:58:50,040
I should say, an orthodox place.

1149
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,100
But the whole of this orthodoxy becomes part and parcel

1150
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:57,050
of you and you become so much tuned with it,

1151
00:58:57,130 --> 00:58:59,140
absolutely tuned with it. You like it.

1152
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,050
You like to love your wife and nobody else in that way.

1153
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:08,180
And the husband likes to love her in a special way,

1154
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:12,190
while the wife wants to love the husband in a special way.

1155
00:59:13,030 --> 00:59:15,060
It happens. There's no insecurity.

1156
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:16,230
Otherwise, you come back home and you find your wife

1157
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:18,090
has eloped with somebody -

1158
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,120
imagine what a situation it is.

1159
00:59:20,230 --> 00:59:24,020
I mean, since I came and first year I got such a shock.

1160
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:26,170
We had a neighbor she was forty-eight years of age

1161
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,000
and her son was about twenty-two

1162
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,200
and he had a friend about twenty years.

1163
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,110
This lady eloped with that twenty-year-old boy,

1164
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:36,210
and she had three other children whom she left.

1165
00:59:37,050 --> 00:59:39,210
The house was sold, the whole household,

1166
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:41,160
because under law she gets half,

1167
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:44,100
half of the property or something like that,

1168
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:47,000
and the three daughters are now on the streets,

1169
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:49,080
the younger three children were daughters are on the street,

1170
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,110
who is going to look after them?

1171
00:59:50,190 --> 00:59:52,080
The lady, forty-eight-year-old lady,

1172
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,050
is still a bride, do you know?

1173
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:57,020
Going to the church and getting married.

1174
00:59:58,020 --> 01:00:01,190
There's no dignity in this, no love, no affection.

1175
01:00:03,110 --> 01:00:06,160
Christ you follow, Christ has said,

1176
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:11,030
"You say 'Thou shall not commit adultery,' I say,

1177
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:14,220
'Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.'"

1178
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:18,140
He's gone up to that subtle stage.

1179
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:23,100
We follow Christ, we wear cross, we go to the church.

1180
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:24,240
Where are we?

1181
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:29,050
So I come to another centre now, is the Vishuddhi.

1182
01:00:29,140 --> 01:00:32,050
This is a very important centre in human beings,

1183
01:00:32,140 --> 01:00:35,160
because when this centre is awakened

1184
01:00:36,240 --> 01:00:39,030
you become the witness.

1185
01:00:39,190 --> 01:00:41,050
You become the collective.

1186
01:00:41,110 --> 01:00:44,020
This is the centre of the collective being.

1187
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:47,120
You become, again I say, you become the collective being,

1188
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,170
when this centre is awakened.

1189
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,160
Is a very important centre,

1190
01:00:52,070 --> 01:00:54,210
and now as I'm with you I must tell about

1191
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:58,160
what we suffer from and what Indians suffer from,

1192
01:00:59,010 --> 01:01:01,020
what the Eastern people suffer from is another thing.

1193
01:01:01,090 --> 01:01:04,070
For example, Eastern people suffer from too much talking

1194
01:01:04,150 --> 01:01:06,050
- right side Vishuddhi we call it -

1195
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:08,210
and the western suffer from not talking at all;

1196
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,040
specially English, they never talk.

1197
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,190
Actually you have to pinch them!

1198
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:19,200
And they never laugh, that's the problem is, they

1199
01:01:20,030 --> 01:01:22,170
just smile and is regarded good manners,

1200
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,120
but this bit sometimes very boring.

1201
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:29,030
Now the Left Vishuddhi is a thing

1202
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:33,010
which is very much, much more subtler than what we think of,

1203
01:01:33,110 --> 01:01:36,190
is a very funny sort of a situation

1204
01:01:37,050 --> 01:01:38,140
where you get a Left Vishuddhi

1205
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,150
and that you get very commonly among the western people,

1206
01:01:43,010 --> 01:01:47,010
because they have developed a new sense of guilt.

1207
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:50,090
I mean everybody is guilty.

1208
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:53,030
Without going to the courts, without committing any guilt,

1209
01:01:53,090 --> 01:01:56,000
everybody is guilty all the time.

1210
01:01:56,110 --> 01:01:59,090
Like a lady, "Oh, I'm so guilty."

1211
01:01:59,170 --> 01:02:00,150
"What happened?"

1212
01:02:00,220 --> 01:02:02,050
"I didn't say 'thank you' to her."

1213
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,060
So it doesn't matter. What is there to be guilty after all?

1214
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,050
"Oh I'm so guilty."

1215
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:08,080
"What happened?"

1216
01:02:08,150 --> 01:02:11,110
"I spilt some coffee." So all right, doesn't matter,

1217
01:02:11,190 --> 01:02:13,190
it can be cleared out, what is there to be guilty?

1218
01:02:14,040 --> 01:02:17,040
But it is an unknown guilt people have,

1219
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:18,200
they don't know why they are guilty,

1220
01:02:19,040 --> 01:02:21,070
why they are getting all the time this feeling.

1221
01:02:21,140 --> 01:02:22,240
"Oh God, I should not have done it,

1222
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,040
I should not have done that." What guilt?

1223
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:29,020
What guilt we can have?

1224
01:02:29,130 --> 01:02:33,000
And this guilt is a horrifying thing.

1225
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:37,190
I have seen - start from America,

1226
01:02:38,020 --> 01:02:41,160
England, Portugal, Spain,

1227
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:44,200
Italy, all that, Switzerland,

1228
01:02:45,050 --> 01:02:48,060
all these places nothing - but Left Vishuddhi

1229
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:52,030
is the first problem and the last which I have to conquer.

1230
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,220
One lady got up and she said,

1231
01:02:54,050 --> 01:02:56,080
"Mother I am guilty because of Vietnam."

1232
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,020
I said, "Vietnam? It is finished long time back now,

1233
01:02:59,090 --> 01:03:00,160
what are you going to do about it?"

1234
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:03,070
No, but I'm guilty about it." "But why?

1235
01:03:03,130 --> 01:03:06,060
What are you going to do about it, how are you concerned with it,

1236
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:09,240
what is your relationship with it, why are you guilty?"

1237
01:03:10,070 --> 01:03:11,130
"I just feel guilty."

1238
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:13,230
I said, "It's nonsense."

1239
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:16,240
Like that everybody has developed this thing.

1240
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,180
Now from where does it come?

1241
01:03:19,030 --> 01:03:23,210
Let's see the source. The first source comes from Bible,

1242
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:26,240
which is very wrongly interpreted, saying that,

1243
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,180
"You are a sinner, a born sinner."

1244
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,060
I mean its absurd. What it means is that,

1245
01:03:33,180 --> 01:03:36,120
that you are the one who is only aware of the sins,

1246
01:03:36,180 --> 01:03:38,070
not the animals.

1247
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:41,180
You are the one who is aware of your ignorance,

1248
01:03:42,010 --> 01:03:43,060
not the animals.

1249
01:03:43,140 --> 01:03:46,000
You are the one who is aware of your blindness,

1250
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:47,240
others are not, animals are not.

1251
01:03:48,070 --> 01:03:50,060
Why?

1252
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:55,070
Because within you is developed that I-ness,

1253
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:57,120
that I-ness as I told you yesterday

1254
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:01,060
is developed because of the ego and the super ego meeting here.

1255
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:03,000
Because you raised your head,

1256
01:04:03,070 --> 01:04:06,010
because this chakra was to be enlightened.

1257
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:11,170
You raised your head and this ego and super ego

1258
01:04:11,230 --> 01:04:14,030
went and met here, it calcified,

1259
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:17,010
you got your I-ness and that's why you think,

1260
01:04:17,070 --> 01:04:19,000
"I've done wrong or I've done right."

1261
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,180
Animals don't think like that, they are not bothered.

1262
01:04:22,060 --> 01:04:24,090
They have to do what they do, they want to do that.

1263
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:26,170
they never sit down and say, "I am guilty."

1264
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,230
Have you ever met any animal who says that? -

1265
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:33,140
except for the human beings, all the time.

1266
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:36,000
Now this has come to, it's a myth,

1267
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,140
it is a very big myth with which you are living.

1268
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:41,220
It’s absolutely myth, believe Me;

1269
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:45,030
there is nothing like guilt.

1270
01:04:45,140 --> 01:04:48,140
And this guilt is eating you off all the time,

1271
01:04:48,220 --> 01:04:50,050
it's making you an inertia,

1272
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:53,220
it is making you feel so much lost,

1273
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:57,150
and this centre is very important

1274
01:04:58,180 --> 01:05:00,020
to be opened out.

1275
01:05:00,090 --> 01:05:03,100
So first of all before I start any program, I tell them

1276
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,190
one mantra you should say, "Mother I am not guilty,

1277
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,210
Mother I am not guilty," sixteen times,

1278
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:11,010
that's the punishment for being guilty.

1279
01:05:11,070 --> 01:05:12,230
If you are guilty you must go into punishment, all right?

1280
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:14,120
So this is the punishment for you,

1281
01:05:14,180 --> 01:05:17,020
is to say, "Mother I am not guilty, Mother I am not guilty."

1282
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:20,020
Say it sixteen times, and that's how you get rid of it.

1283
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:22,240
It's so practical, it works out.

1284
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:26,050
With that you get spondylitis, you get pain in the heart,

1285
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:28,230
you get this hand what you call frigid hand,

1286
01:05:29,050 --> 01:05:31,090
all problems you get with that,

1287
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:34,110
and that is all because of this mythical guilt

1288
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:35,190
you are working out.

1289
01:05:36,020 --> 01:05:37,170
Now the another myth comes,

1290
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:40,240
the source of it I think is the psychologist,

1291
01:05:41,100 --> 01:05:42,220
the so-called psychologist.

1292
01:05:43,050 --> 01:05:44,210
They have no sense of psyche,

1293
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:47,060
because they have no way of entering into psyche,

1294
01:05:47,160 --> 01:05:50,080
what they are doing is recording, finding out,

1295
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:51,210
and trying to cure people.

1296
01:05:52,030 --> 01:05:54,100
How many mad people have they cured?

1297
01:05:55,020 --> 01:05:57,060
Sahaja Yoga must have cured hundreds.

1298
01:05:57,140 --> 01:05:59,130
How many mad people have they cured?

1299
01:05:59,220 --> 01:06:00,240
They have not cured anyone.

1300
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:03,050
On the contrary, if you go to a psychologist,

1301
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:07,030
you might become more mad, the way they are mad themselves;

1302
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:12,030
because these psychologists, when they talk to people,

1303
01:06:12,130 --> 01:06:15,050
they don't know they are dealing with pathological cases,

1304
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,020
abnormal cases.

1305
01:06:17,100 --> 01:06:19,100
And when you deal with the pathological cases,

1306
01:06:19,170 --> 01:06:23,050
you yourself get intoxicated by that,

1307
01:06:23,130 --> 01:06:26,140
or you can say that there is contamination.

1308
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:28,160
And you don't know how to protect yourself.

1309
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:31,220
Jung is the only psychologist, I would say,

1310
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:33,240
because he was quite a prophet/perfect person,

1311
01:06:34,050 --> 01:06:36,020
after he got realization, who talked of it,

1312
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:39,020
that a physician can get sick.

1313
01:06:39,100 --> 01:06:41,100
Now, they start becoming pathological

1314
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:44,120
like poor this Freud, half-baked.

1315
01:06:44,210 --> 01:06:48,050
He is the one who started talking about sex

1316
01:06:48,130 --> 01:06:51,100
and things like that, but he himself was a perverted man.

1317
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:54,060
He died of cancer, what did he get in his own life?

1318
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:55,180
He was such a perverted man.

1319
01:06:56,010 --> 01:07:00,020
I mean, imagine, he was a wretched soul who died of cancer.

1320
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:03,040
How can he guide anyone on, any point whatsoever?

1321
01:07:03,130 --> 01:07:06,180
Now whatever he talked we took him as Bible,

1322
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:09,070
more than Bible, people believe in Freud.

1323
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:12,040
More than Christ. they believe in him actually,

1324
01:07:12,100 --> 01:07:15,240
and if you reduce it

1325
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:19,130
to a minimum sentence you can say he made

1326
01:07:19,210 --> 01:07:21,210
everyone a sex point.

1327
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,090
You are nothing beyond it, nothing more than that,

1328
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:28,100
nothing else but that.

1329
01:07:28,180 --> 01:07:31,060
Imagine, to reduce your dignity to that level!

1330
01:07:33,050 --> 01:07:36,210
It’s as a Mother I just give him a grace mark by saying

1331
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,100
poor fellow must have dealt with pathological cases,

1332
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:42,190
and he was caught up and he gave these wrong ideas to people.

1333
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:44,080
He dealt only with the psyche,

1334
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,050
with the left side which is also starting from there,

1335
01:07:48,180 --> 01:07:50,130
but ends up there,

1336
01:07:50,230 --> 01:07:54,200
ends up into your super ego.

1337
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:59,100
So sex addiction takes you to super ego,

1338
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,120
means it takes you to your subconscious mind

1339
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:04,100
and to your collective subconscious.

1340
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,120
Now all your problems you are having by sex

1341
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,210
are because of this.

1342
01:08:09,230 --> 01:08:12,230
Emotional behaviour and all perversions

1343
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:15,020
take you to collective subconscious.

1344
01:08:15,130 --> 01:08:18,230
There was a girl in India, which is very abnormal,

1345
01:08:19,060 --> 01:08:22,100
she came to Me and she said that she wants to be

1346
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:27,210
with girls and she wants to marry a girl,

1347
01:08:28,070 --> 01:08:30,060
she wants to dress up like a man.

1348
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:32,040
I said to her, "Really?"

1349
01:08:32,130 --> 01:08:37,010
So I gave her some Sahaja Yoga treatment

1350
01:08:37,090 --> 01:08:41,020
and I found that there was a man in her.

1351
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:43,160
She was reduced to nothing,

1352
01:08:43,240 --> 01:08:46,020
this was a man who was possessing her,

1353
01:08:46,150 --> 01:08:50,200
and she was given these ideas through that man,

1354
01:08:50,240 --> 01:08:52,060
and that's was how she was talking,

1355
01:08:52,140 --> 01:08:53,160
she was a possessed person.

1356
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:56,240
All these abnormalities come because you get possessed.

1357
01:08:57,110 --> 01:08:59,240
There was a girl in Cuba who came to see Me.

1358
01:09:00,100 --> 01:09:03,140
From Cuba, in America, a short girl, very petite,

1359
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:06,170
small, good looking girl and she told Me,

1360
01:09:07,020 --> 01:09:09,140
her husband told Me, "Mother, it's surprising,

1361
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:13,140
my wife can take whiskey bottle neat like that one,

1362
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:15,050
she can drink it down." So I said,

1363
01:09:15,130 --> 01:09:18,200
"All right sit down." I gave her a bhandan as we call it,

1364
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:22,160
and I saw a big, huge

1365
01:09:23,050 --> 01:09:25,060
like a globe - trotter

1366
01:09:26,050 --> 01:09:29,160
really a very huge negro coming out of her,

1367
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:32,220
and I looked at her. I said, "Do you know any negro?"

1368
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:35,170
She said, "Mother, do You see him? Do You see him?

1369
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:39,030
He is the one who drinks, I do not drink,"

1370
01:09:39,180 --> 01:09:41,130
she said to Me.

1371
01:09:42,040 --> 01:09:43,230
And when he was distracted from her,

1372
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:46,090
she became such a sweet wife to her husband.

1373
01:09:48,060 --> 01:09:51,200
All these abnormal behaviors when you overdo it,

1374
01:09:52,060 --> 01:09:54,090
lead us to that collective subconscious,

1375
01:09:54,160 --> 01:09:56,210
where you catch all these horrible people.

1376
01:09:57,040 --> 01:10:00,090
Also it can lead you to collective supraconscious

1377
01:10:00,160 --> 01:10:03,230
if you become very, very egoistical.

1378
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,100
Then you can become Hitler.

1379
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:10,130
"What's wrong? What's wrong? What's wrong with Hitler?"

1380
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,070
Nothing wrong, he was perfectly correct

1381
01:10:13,130 --> 01:10:16,230
when he said that he has come to save all the Aryan race

1382
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,130
and his nose was a specially made one.

1383
01:10:19,200 --> 01:10:22,200
I mean God must have been surprised to hear all that,

1384
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:26,090
I mean you have to create some variety, isn't it?

1385
01:10:27,090 --> 01:10:28,210
But this is what it is,

1386
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,230
I mean these absurd things that we do in our life as saying,

1387
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:35,180
"What's wrong?" We jump into those ditches

1388
01:10:36,020 --> 01:10:39,160
where you cannot return without some load on your head,

1389
01:10:40,010 --> 01:10:42,040
and those loads work out all the things,

1390
01:10:42,100 --> 01:10:43,180
and you become such abnormal people.

1391
01:10:43,240 --> 01:10:47,130
Then on the street you'll stand and shout like a madman,

1392
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,240
and if you provoke them they are even worse,

1393
01:10:51,090 --> 01:10:53,100
so better not talk with them and argue with them.

1394
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,000
Forget them. All those fanatics that we see are nothing

1395
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,030
but possessed people.

1396
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,180
Most of them are possessed.

1397
01:11:03,040 --> 01:11:08,170
I would say so many of presidents and these despotic people,

1398
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:11,010
most of them are possessed. I meet them,

1399
01:11:11,090 --> 01:11:13,110
I shake hands with them, they shake before Me

1400
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:16,080
and I know that they are possessed people,

1401
01:11:16,170 --> 01:11:18,010
how are they there?

1402
01:11:18,090 --> 01:11:19,230
They should not be there, they are possessed,

1403
01:11:20,060 --> 01:11:21,230
they possess other people, they make them work out

1404
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,040
and all this aggressiveness starts

1405
01:11:24,170 --> 01:11:27,090
through their possessive powers.

1406
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:34,130
So this centre is the one which brings you back to normal,

1407
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:39,220
and then once the Kundalini rises and touches

1408
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:45,160
your fontanel bone area and opens it out,

1409
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:49,170
then from your hand through this centre,

1410
01:11:50,190 --> 01:11:56,060
that collective personality starts manifesting.

1411
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:59,200
You become the collective personality, you become.

1412
01:12:00,030 --> 01:12:02,000
Again I say it’s the actualization,

1413
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,000
it is not that "We are brothers and sisters

1414
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,130
let us form United Nations and make good money out of it."

1415
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:12,170
It is actualization that

1416
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:16,060
you feel another person within yourself

1417
01:12:19,150 --> 01:12:22,060
and this is what is most important.

1418
01:12:22,180 --> 01:12:26,180
This centre, I mean I can talk about this

1419
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,000
I don't know how many hours but,

1420
01:12:29,090 --> 01:12:31,110
this centre has sixteen subplexes

1421
01:12:31,230 --> 01:12:35,070
and it looks after your eyes, nose, ear, nose, throat

1422
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,110
- everything, neck,

1423
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:40,220
even your face and all that, is governed by this.

1424
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:42,170
A collective person,

1425
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,000
a collective being has a face

1426
01:12:46,220 --> 01:12:49,110
which has a coefficients that even the face

1427
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,230
can emit vibrations,

1428
01:12:54,090 --> 01:12:56,220
but this is to be seen only through vibrations,

1429
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,220
you will know who is the collective being.

1430
01:13:00,220 --> 01:13:04,150
The most important is this part of the head

1431
01:13:04,230 --> 01:13:08,140
where I told you that when you bow yourself to wrong things

1432
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,180
this is the biggest obstruction,

1433
01:13:12,010 --> 01:13:15,120
is the lower plate of the brain

1434
01:13:15,190 --> 01:13:18,120
which is called as Murdha in Sanskrit language.

1435
01:13:18,230 --> 01:13:20,220
It is very important, it gets swollen up

1436
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,110
and a big barrier is built

1437
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:26,200
and you become a person completely cut off

1438
01:13:27,040 --> 01:13:28,150
from the all-pervading Power.

1439
01:13:28,230 --> 01:13:31,140
Means all the protections, all the guidance,

1440
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:34,170
all the nurturing things, everything

1441
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:38,090
starts disappearing from your life.

1442
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:44,070
Now we go ahead with that centre to the centre here,

1443
01:13:44,140 --> 01:13:46,190
which is very important and which I must tell you, though,

1444
01:13:47,030 --> 01:13:50,020
it's time to finish this lecture,

1445
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:55,060
is the centre of Agnya

1446
01:13:55,170 --> 01:13:58,140
which is placed in the

1447
01:13:59,190 --> 01:14:03,030
centre of pituitary and pineal body

1448
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:06,080
which controls our ego and superego,

1449
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,230
between the optic chiasma, a very subtle centre exists.

1450
01:14:10,060 --> 01:14:11,110
Some people call it a third eye

1451
01:14:11,200 --> 01:14:15,050
but the third eye they see is not the one I am talking about.

1452
01:14:15,140 --> 01:14:21,060
The third eye means the eye we see it inside not outside.

1453
01:14:22,230 --> 01:14:26,060
This centre is very important

1454
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:30,140
and is adorned by the deity

1455
01:14:36,000 --> 01:14:39,160
of Mahavishnu according to Indian name

1456
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:44,100
and English name is Lord Jesus Christ.

1457
01:14:44,240 --> 01:14:46,220
This is a very important centre.

1458
01:14:47,070 --> 01:14:49,100
"Now seek your Lord."

1459
01:14:49,180 --> 01:14:51,240
Where do you seek Him? Where does He exist?

1460
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:55,210
He's to be awakened and He resides here

1461
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:58,120
because most of you are coming from that background

1462
01:14:58,190 --> 01:14:59,190
I want to talk about it,

1463
01:15:00,020 --> 01:15:02,100
though Mahavira and Mahabuddha

1464
01:15:02,230 --> 01:15:05,010
both of them also reside within us:

1465
01:15:05,090 --> 01:15:09,040
Mahavira resides here and Buddha resides here.

1466
01:15:09,150 --> 01:15:14,230
But Christ resides here in the centre, inside the brain.

1467
01:15:15,210 --> 01:15:19,210
Now this is a very important thing

1468
01:15:20,050 --> 01:15:22,090
which all the Christian institutions

1469
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:25,020
have missed about Christ.

1470
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:28,150
That Christ is to be born within us.

1471
01:15:28,240 --> 01:15:31,180
That He's to be awakened within us.

1472
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:35,070
That is only done through Kundalini awakening

1473
01:15:35,180 --> 01:15:39,040
and once He's awakened, at that point,

1474
01:15:39,130 --> 01:15:42,130
ego and superego both are sucked by Him,

1475
01:15:42,230 --> 01:15:44,100
as a result of His awakening

1476
01:15:44,190 --> 01:15:46,190
and this is a very big thing.

1477
01:15:47,050 --> 01:15:49,200
That's why He said, "I am the door."

1478
01:15:50,130 --> 01:15:52,090
But very nice, they crucified Him.

1479
01:15:52,180 --> 01:15:54,230
But that crucifixion was also a drama,

1480
01:15:55,070 --> 01:15:59,230
because ego and superego has pressed this point so hard,

1481
01:16:00,050 --> 01:16:03,010
that to pass through that you needed somebody

1482
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:06,230
to be just divine, and He was Omkara Himself,

1483
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,100
the divine personality

1484
01:16:08,190 --> 01:16:12,040
Who never died and passed through that.

1485
01:16:13,020 --> 01:16:16,040
Krishna has said, Who is at this point,

1486
01:16:16,150 --> 01:16:17,120
has said that “Nayanam chidanti shastrani,

1487
01:16:17,210 --> 01:16:20,150
nayanam dahati pavaka.” He said,

1488
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:27,130
"This divine power, this Omkara,

1489
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,090
never can be killed by anyone,

1490
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:33,080
it cannot be destroyed by anyone,"

1491
01:16:34,050 --> 01:16:40,160
and this itself took the birth of Jesus Christ.

1492
01:16:41,030 --> 01:16:43,200
To create that passage for us.

1493
01:16:45,110 --> 01:16:50,090
And that is the thing He proved, that it cannot be killed.

1494
01:16:50,190 --> 01:16:53,080
But They are all One and related to each other.

1495
01:16:53,170 --> 01:16:55,220
This you'll discover in Sahaja Yoga itself

1496
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:58,140
because when the rapport is established,

1497
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:00,110
you have to ask questions.

1498
01:17:00,190 --> 01:17:04,190
What is the relationship between Jesus and Krishna?

1499
01:17:05,080 --> 01:17:07,140
And you can discover it on vibrations:

1500
01:17:08,060 --> 01:17:11,090
They are all related to each other, very closely.

1501
01:17:11,180 --> 01:17:14,170
Christ has said, "Those who are not against Me are with Me."

1502
01:17:15,010 --> 01:17:17,110
Nobody has tried to find out who are those.

1503
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,060
It is said in the Bible that

1504
01:17:19,140 --> 01:17:21,080
"I'll appear before you like tongues of flames."

1505
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:24,110
Nobody tried to find out what is that, or Tree of Life -

1506
01:17:24,180 --> 01:17:27,030
is this the Tree of Life.

1507
01:17:27,240 --> 01:17:29,220
So He is to be awakened within you,

1508
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:32,210
that's the main point that He said that

1509
01:17:33,020 --> 01:17:36,070
"Somebody will come and awaken it,

1510
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:39,080
so that you will know My Father forever."

1511
01:17:39,190 --> 01:17:41,130
Now which one of the institutions

1512
01:17:41,220 --> 01:17:45,020
which are running in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ

1513
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,080
are doing that job?

1514
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:48,210
What they are doing is having a fete, or a carnival,

1515
01:17:49,050 --> 01:17:51,220
collecting money, building churches, this, that.

1516
01:17:52,050 --> 01:17:54,140
You have to build every human being as a church

1517
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:57,210
by awakening Christ in them.

1518
01:17:58,050 --> 01:18:01,050
That was what was meant by baptism.

1519
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:03,220
But whom did baptism in the real sense

1520
01:18:04,050 --> 01:18:06,210
is the Kundalini awakening when it comes

1521
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:10,170
on the fontanel bone area which is called

1522
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:13,190
as the brahmarandhra, and breaks through that.

1523
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:18,020
Who has done that? None.

1524
01:18:18,140 --> 01:18:21,050
I went to a church called Unity Church,

1525
01:18:21,140 --> 01:18:23,140
they have united all the churches I believe

1526
01:18:23,220 --> 01:18:26,030
and also united all the ghosts of the world.

1527
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:29,090
All kinds of fake gurus are there, all kinds,

1528
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:32,140
they have no discrimination of any kind.

1529
01:18:34,220 --> 01:18:37,230
I am so amazed, you know. Christ,

1530
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:41,000
He was not so diplomatic I should say

1531
01:18:41,090 --> 01:18:44,090
because the way He lashed at these people and then He said,

1532
01:18:44,200 --> 01:18:46,200
"If they are hot, we can manage them" -

1533
01:18:47,030 --> 01:18:48,160
means “if they are hot” means they're caught up,

1534
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:51,190
we'll manage them: if they are cold, we like them;

1535
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:56,030
but if they are half-way, "I spit them out of My mouth."

1536
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,170
These are His words.

1537
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:02,110
Because these half-baked people compromising with the devil,

1538
01:19:02,190 --> 01:19:04,170
and talking of God.

1539
01:19:05,050 --> 01:19:07,130
How are they going to deliver the goods?

1540
01:19:09,080 --> 01:19:11,160
Why not awaken your Christ within yourself

1541
01:19:11,220 --> 01:19:13,090
and see for yourself?

1542
01:19:13,190 --> 01:19:15,160
You'll be amazed when you raise the Kundalini

1543
01:19:15,230 --> 01:19:17,120
and Kundalini comes up to this point

1544
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:19,140
and it cannot go further,

1545
01:19:19,220 --> 01:19:21,140
among all the Christians this is a problem.

1546
01:19:21,220 --> 01:19:24,170
You have to ask them to say Lord's Prayer, and it works,

1547
01:19:25,020 --> 01:19:26,110
that's a mantra.

1548
01:19:29,090 --> 01:19:32,020
At the time when your, this centre is catching,

1549
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:36,060
because Krishna is a Collective Being,

1550
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,200
"Allah hu Akbar" means the same.

1551
01:19:39,030 --> 01:19:41,060
You have to put your fingers into your ears and say,

1552
01:19:41,140 --> 01:19:44,070
"Allah hu Akbar" realized souls,

1553
01:19:44,180 --> 01:19:46,180
and you'll get the kundalini rising.

1554
01:19:47,010 --> 01:19:48,180
You can see the pulsation of the Kundalini

1555
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:49,230
at the triangular bone,

1556
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,110
you can see the rising of the Kundalini,

1557
01:19:51,170 --> 01:19:55,200
you can feel the breaking of Kundalini at the Sahasrara

1558
01:19:56,010 --> 01:19:58,180
at the point where it comes and breaks it.

1559
01:19:59,180 --> 01:20:02,060
So you enter through the gate of Christ

1560
01:20:02,140 --> 01:20:05,010
who sucks these two institutions

1561
01:20:05,120 --> 01:20:07,090
and makes the way here,

1562
01:20:08,170 --> 01:20:10,130
and once the Kundalini rises above the Agnya,

1563
01:20:10,190 --> 01:20:11,220
you become thoughtless.

1564
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:17,040
The limbic area is the Kingdom of God

1565
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:21,200
from where you are guided and the Kundalini passes through.

1566
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:24,030
That's the last job that is to be done,

1567
01:20:24,110 --> 01:20:26,220
and now it is done.

1568
01:20:27,170 --> 01:20:29,190
That is done now en masse.

1569
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:32,140
It has to be done, it was to be done,

1570
01:20:32,220 --> 01:20:35,200
it was promised, the time has come.

1571
01:20:36,240 --> 01:20:39,210
But where are the people, sometimes I wonder?

1572
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:42,160
I am in England now with you;

1573
01:20:43,020 --> 01:20:47,160
you'll be amazed that in India, these people have seen,

1574
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:51,210
thousands and thousands are there to receive Realization

1575
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,060
in the villages.

1576
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:56,240
Here I find people don't want reality,

1577
01:20:57,060 --> 01:20:58,220
you should have a circus.

1578
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:02,040
At least English people come but Indians very few

1579
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:03,210
and they never stick on.

1580
01:21:04,020 --> 01:21:06,240
It’s so amazing that I can't understand.

1581
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:10,050
It's amazing how things work out.

1582
01:21:12,040 --> 01:21:14,130
When are we going to take to it?

1583
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:18,010
I mean it's free, you don't have to pay anything,

1584
01:21:18,090 --> 01:21:20,240
it's your own, it is spontaneous, it is there.

1585
01:21:21,120 --> 01:21:25,050
But still, they get Realization, they get lost.

1586
01:21:25,150 --> 01:21:27,040
It's something so surprising,

1587
01:21:27,130 --> 01:21:30,120
I've been working here, you won't believe, ten years now,

1588
01:21:30,190 --> 01:21:32,040
eight years, eight years.

1589
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:37,030
For four years, in the first four years I had six people,

1590
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:40,020
they would come up, go down, come up, go down.

1591
01:21:40,110 --> 01:21:42,110
I said, "What sort of people?"

1592
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,120
Four years, can you imagine?

1593
01:21:45,220 --> 01:21:49,170
In India, I go for three months and I get thousands.

1594
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:53,170
Is it that there are very few who are going to be saved,

1595
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:55,030
as told by John?

1596
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:58,030
He said only a few thousand are going to be saved,

1597
01:21:58,110 --> 01:22:01,110
is that what we are going to do in the West?

1598
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:03,190
But England is the minimum,

1599
01:22:04,030 --> 01:22:06,240
you'll be amazed even Italy is better,

1600
01:22:07,090 --> 01:22:11,050
Switzerland, Geneva, so much better, what's happening?

1601
01:22:11,130 --> 01:22:16,090
Here they run after a man who is asking for a Rolls Royce,

1602
01:22:17,080 --> 01:22:19,050
a fellow who asks for a 59-th Rolls Royce,

1603
01:22:19,130 --> 01:22:21,020
they starve themselves

1604
01:22:21,090 --> 01:22:23,170
and made a Rolls Royce for him and when he came,

1605
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,140
they gave him the Rolls Royce, imagine?

1606
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,220
They said he's a perfect master.

1607
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:30,080
There is no pure intelligence left in the mind

1608
01:22:30,140 --> 01:22:32,240
to understand that how can you get Spirit

1609
01:22:33,050 --> 01:22:35,170
for this nonsensical Rolls Royce?

1610
01:22:36,130 --> 01:22:39,060
At least Derbyshire are not, people from Derbyshire

1611
01:22:39,130 --> 01:22:41,190
should not be impressed by that very much,

1612
01:22:42,050 --> 01:22:44,140
because they make it here.

1613
01:22:45,190 --> 01:22:48,060
You cannot make God, can you?

1614
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:51,000
You can make Rolls Royces, all right,

1615
01:22:51,100 --> 01:22:53,240
can you exchange Rolls Royce for God?

1616
01:22:54,160 --> 01:22:56,130
They are running after such horrible things,

1617
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,140
like horrible another thing that somebody

1618
01:22:58,200 --> 01:23:00,100
is trying to teach you how to fly.

1619
01:23:00,190 --> 01:23:02,130
The wife of the director is sitting here

1620
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,200
 who started is suffering with epilepsy -

1621
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:07,030
her husband got epilepsy, her daughter got epilepsy,

1622
01:23:07,130 --> 01:23:08,170
they all were epileptic,

1623
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:10,240
and they were paying thousands of pounds,

1624
01:23:11,050 --> 01:23:13,080
three thousand pounds to fly,

1625
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:18,130
and they starting hopping themselves like a frog. Imagine!

1626
01:23:19,170 --> 01:23:21,130
With pure intelligence you must ask

1627
01:23:21,220 --> 01:23:25,200
that guru to drop himself from the leaning Tower of Pisa,

1628
01:23:26,030 --> 01:23:27,190
I think it was made only for that,

1629
01:23:28,050 --> 01:23:32,240
and see if he can fly even one inch higher.

1630
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:35,170
Why not use your intelligence?

1631
01:23:35,230 --> 01:23:37,180
You are supposed to be most balanced

1632
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,010
and intelligent people.

1633
01:23:41,070 --> 01:23:44,000
Yesterday I told you that you are placed,

1634
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:48,160
the most important place in the Universe is the Heart,

1635
01:23:49,000 --> 01:23:51,070
England is the Heart of the Universe

1636
01:23:51,170 --> 01:23:54,220
and the Heart is lethargic.

1637
01:23:56,030 --> 01:23:57,050
What can I do?

1638
01:23:57,130 --> 01:23:59,130
You have to tell Me, what am I to do,

1639
01:23:59,210 --> 01:24:02,180
to pump this Heart into reality.

1640
01:24:03,020 --> 01:24:05,020
There are seekers, I would not say there are seekers,

1641
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:08,240
When it came to hippieism, thousands became hippies.

1642
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:11,210
But all absurd things they accept very easily

1643
01:24:12,030 --> 01:24:15,110
and why not the thing that you are seeking?

1644
01:24:16,020 --> 01:24:18,160
It's beyond My mind. I cannot understand.

1645
01:24:18,240 --> 01:24:21,020
Now I didn't come to this place as an immigrant, as I told

1646
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:25,050
you. I was, just came, I came here because something happened

1647
01:24:25,130 --> 01:24:27,140
and My husband got elected to this country,

1648
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:29,190
which was important, which was,

1649
01:24:30,030 --> 01:24:32,240
I think, was pre-ordained. It was to be.

1650
01:24:33,130 --> 01:24:37,220
But I have to implore you now to take to this and understand

1651
01:24:38,160 --> 01:24:40,160
that this is what William Blake has told you

1652
01:24:40,220 --> 01:24:46,190
that "The prophets are going to be in this country,

1653
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,200
that the God of men are going to become prophets

1654
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:51,170
and they are going to have the power

1655
01:24:51,240 --> 01:24:54,000
to make others prophets." That is Sahaja Yoga.

1656
01:24:54,110 --> 01:24:56,240
There's nothing else but this.

1657
01:24:58,150 --> 01:25:00,000
He has promised so many things.

1658
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:03,050
He has even described the house where I live,

1659
01:25:03,140 --> 01:25:06,000
he has described the house that we are occupying now,

1660
01:25:06,080 --> 01:25:07,170
exact position.

1661
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:11,230
He has described the ashram where we'll lay our foundations,

1662
01:25:12,230 --> 01:25:18,120
into such details that I'm amazed such a great sage

1663
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:20,140
and a seer was born in this great country

1664
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:24,060
and nobody wants to see it through. Now what am I to do?

1665
01:25:26,020 --> 01:25:31,110
I hope very soon people would realize

1666
01:25:32,090 --> 01:25:35,200
that they have to take a very big role,

1667
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:39,110
a very important and vital role

1668
01:25:39,220 --> 01:25:42,060
in the transformation of the whole humanity

1669
01:25:42,160 --> 01:25:46,060
and saving of this disastrous time.

1670
01:25:46,220 --> 01:25:48,230
They are the ones who have to lead people

1671
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,090
into the Kingdom of God.

1672
01:25:51,220 --> 01:25:54,020
I can hope and bless that.

1673
01:25:54,110 --> 01:25:57,170
May God bless you!

1674
01:26:03,220 --> 01:26:07,180
Luckily we have a very good standard

1675
01:26:08,110 --> 01:26:10,150
of the Sahaja Yogis in Derbyshire,

1676
01:26:11,010 --> 01:26:12,180
really it's surprising

1677
01:26:13,040 --> 01:26:16,240
and Blake has mentioned Derbyshire very much,

1678
01:26:17,120 --> 01:26:19,010
they wanted Me to come to Derbyshire.

1679
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:21,050
I said, "Birmingham has been sufficient for Me

1680
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:22,120
and I am not going to Derbyshire."

1681
01:26:22,190 --> 01:26:24,010
And they said, "Mother, please." And then he said,

1682
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:26,080
"Blake has mentioned You come to Derbyshire."

1683
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:27,200
And that's how I am here

1684
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:32,090
and I hope that this centre will definitely create

1685
01:26:32,180 --> 01:26:34,120
very good Sahaja Yogis.

1686
01:26:34,230 --> 01:26:38,230
Great prophets can be created out of this,

1687
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:42,100
after all Blake has mentioned Derbyshire very strongly,

1688
01:26:42,200 --> 01:26:43,170
he recommended it.

1689
01:26:43,230 --> 01:26:46,060
But what I find today when I went for a drive,

1690
01:26:46,150 --> 01:26:48,100
there's a lot of black magic on.

1691
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:52,210
People are indulging into horrible, horrible things.

1692
01:26:53,090 --> 01:26:56,150
I was worried, quite worried.

1693
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,030
It's a very dangerous thing.

1694
01:26:59,210 --> 01:27:01,230
It's dangerous for you, for your children,

1695
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,120
for your families, for everyone,

1696
01:27:04,210 --> 01:27:06,170
and I found those pockets,

1697
01:27:07,030 --> 01:27:09,210
I was amazed how they are prospering here.

1698
01:27:10,070 --> 01:27:15,140
May God give you strength and proper wisdom

1699
01:27:15,230 --> 01:27:20,000
to understand how you are placed in relation

1700
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:23,100
to the great work of God.

1701
01:27:30,210 --> 01:27:32,040
Now if you have any questions,

1702
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:33,120
we can have for about for five minutes,

1703
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,060
yesterday many people asked many questions,

1704
01:27:35,120 --> 01:27:38,040
actually first day only I allow people to ask questions

1705
01:27:38,150 --> 01:27:40,090
because second day it is quite a waste of time.

1706
01:27:40,150 --> 01:27:42,230
Now don't ask personal questions for heaven's sake,

1707
01:27:43,070 --> 01:27:44,210
don't ask any personal question.

1708
01:27:45,030 --> 01:27:47,170
That we'll attend to them later on, personally,

1709
01:27:48,010 --> 01:27:49,040
they can be attended to;

1710
01:27:49,120 --> 01:27:50,240
but anything general if you want to ask,

1711
01:27:51,060 --> 01:27:53,210
please ask the question general.

1712
01:28:07,030 --> 01:28:08,200
Audience question: Have You seen God Yourself?

1713
01:28:09,020 --> 01:28:10,060
Why do you ask this question?

1714
01:28:10,120 --> 01:28:12,110
Are you authorized to ask that question?

1715
01:28:13,060 --> 01:28:15,200
First you see your Spirit and then we'll talk about it.

1716
01:28:16,050 --> 01:28:17,110
Why should you ask such a question?

1717
01:28:17,170 --> 01:28:20,230
Are you an Indian? Then at least keep some manners.

1718
01:28:21,060 --> 01:28:22,110
Please be seated.

1719
01:28:22,220 --> 01:28:24,230
This kind of an arrogant question should not be asked,

1720
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,030
"Have You seen God?"

1721
01:28:27,160 --> 01:28:28,230
Why should you ask Me such a question?

1722
01:28:29,050 --> 01:28:31,170
What authority have you got to ask that question to Me?

1723
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:34,110
I have to ask you question: have you felt your Spirit?

1724
01:28:34,190 --> 01:28:36,050
All right, first feel your Spirit,

1725
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:38,110
that's why Buddha never talked of God,

1726
01:28:38,190 --> 01:28:39,220
I yesterday only told you;

1727
01:28:40,060 --> 01:28:42,020
because suddenly you want to see God -

1728
01:28:42,090 --> 01:28:43,120
have you got eyes to see God?

1729
01:28:43,200 --> 01:28:46,110
You can't see Me even, how can you see God?

1730
01:28:50,190 --> 01:28:54,000
First of all become your Spirit, then we'll talk about it.

1731
01:28:54,060 --> 01:28:56,020
A little child won't go

1732
01:28:56,090 --> 01:29:01,080
and talk to a king and slap him on the face, will he?

1733
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:03,220
Is he supposed to do that?

1734
01:29:04,090 --> 01:29:06,200
We must know our boundaries, our maryadas.

1735
01:29:07,080 --> 01:29:10,200
Specially Indians must know, I'm surprised sometimes.

1736
01:29:11,130 --> 01:29:12,200
To ask such a question like that:

1737
01:29:13,030 --> 01:29:15,020
"Have you seen God?" Whether I've seen Him or not,

1738
01:29:15,080 --> 01:29:17,080
why should I tell you? But what does he say?...

1739
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:25,170
Doesn't behoove, doesn't behoove you. It is very arrogant.

1740
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:28,070
I am surprised that you've learned such ways here,

1741
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:32,230
it is never done by an Indian, it's very embarrassing.

1742
01:29:34,180 --> 01:29:36,090
Just imagine, if I have seen it,

1743
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:38,020
is he going to believe Me? -

1744
01:29:38,150 --> 01:29:41,010
or not seen it (Hindi).

1745
01:29:47,180 --> 01:29:52,180
...All this come and come somethimes I feel.

1746
01:29:56,190 --> 01:30:00,100
I mean, what a question it is, “Have You seen or not?”

1747
01:30:21,190 --> 01:30:25,070
But he's a Master of Philosophy from Benares University,

1748
01:30:25,130 --> 01:30:27,170
and all that, but in India you won't find such people,

1749
01:30:27,230 --> 01:30:30,030
I don't know from where these materialistic,

1750
01:30:30,110 --> 01:30:32,090
absolutely gross people are,

1751
01:30:32,170 --> 01:30:34,160
I mean what a question to ask Me?

1752
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:42,030
It's never done.

1753
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:50,190
I'm here to give you Self Realization, that's all.

1754
01:30:51,080 --> 01:30:55,080
And you should get it, that's your right.

1755
01:30:56,050 --> 01:30:57,230
This is a bank I should say

1756
01:30:58,060 --> 01:31:00,230
and I have to sign your checks, that's all.

1757
01:31:01,200 --> 01:31:05,220
If you get your checks signed, that's all,

1758
01:31:06,050 --> 01:31:07,190
finished, that's My relationship with you,

1759
01:31:08,020 --> 01:31:09,140
I'm not going to tell you about Myself

1760
01:31:09,220 --> 01:31:11,110
to get crucified again.

1761
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:15,110
Christ tried to tell something about Himself,

1762
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:17,190
and they crucified Him.

1763
01:31:18,060 --> 01:31:21,170
Now if I tell him, "Of course I know about God,"

1764
01:31:22,030 --> 01:31:23,060
he is not going to accept.

1765
01:31:23,160 --> 01:31:26,190
If I say, "I don't know," then he is not going to accept.

1766
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:28,100
Stupid.

1767
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:30,210
Indians are not stupid at all, they are very wise people,

1768
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:31,210
I must say.

1769
01:31:32,040 --> 01:31:35,130
I am surprised from where this stupidity has come.

1770
01:31:38,040 --> 01:31:39,070
Very wise.

1771
01:31:39,130 --> 01:31:41,150
Indians are very wise because it’s a yoga bhoomi, you know,

1772
01:31:41,210 --> 01:31:44,110
such a, it’s such an ancient country of ours.

1773
01:31:44,190 --> 01:31:47,150
You don't know the praises of this country I can ...

1774
01:31:48,120 --> 01:31:51,150
Do not judge them by the people you see, no, no, no, no, no.

1775
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:56,000
It’s very great country, it’s very great, it’s spiritual,

1776
01:31:56,060 --> 01:31:57,220
absolute spiritual country.

1777
01:31:58,060 --> 01:32:00,140
See these are I don't know what's the matter with them,

1778
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:02,030
very superficial people have come here,

1779
01:32:02,110 --> 01:32:03,180
extremely superficial.

1780
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:06,030
There are some great souls also I say,

1781
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,220
but don't judge, don't judge that great country.

1782
01:32:11,090 --> 01:32:14,120
Once I was going to India with My husband and I told him,

1783
01:32:14,200 --> 01:32:16,090
"We've touched our country." And he said, "How do You know?"

1784
01:32:16,170 --> 01:32:18,120
I said, "See, the vibrations!

1785
01:32:18,210 --> 01:32:23,010
The whole country is vibrating, the atmosphere is vibrating."

1786
01:32:23,200 --> 01:32:24,170
He said, "Really?"

1787
01:32:25,000 --> 01:32:26,120
I said, "You go and ask the pilot."

1788
01:32:26,210 --> 01:32:28,240
We were in the first class, he went down and he asked him.

1789
01:32:29,090 --> 01:32:32,030
He said, "Sir, we just touched it about a minute back."

1790
01:32:33,000 --> 01:32:35,140
Such a great country like that,

1791
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,020
the whole, the Kundalini of the Universe

1792
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:40,010
resides in that country, can you imagine -

1793
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:44,050
the Kundalini. And they have no desire to seek,

1794
01:32:44,130 --> 01:32:46,120
that's the power of desire that resides there,

1795
01:32:46,210 --> 01:32:48,040
and they have no power to seek.

1796
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,190
Can you imagine? (Hindi)

1797
01:32:51,210 --> 01:32:53,130
I am Myself surprised

1798
01:32:53,240 --> 01:32:55,200
and those who have come also like gurus,

1799
01:32:56,070 --> 01:32:58,150
horrible people making money,

1800
01:32:59,150 --> 01:33:03,070
I'm ashamed if I am an Indian by any chance or if,

1801
01:33:03,180 --> 01:33:07,010
as I'm ashamed I sometimes feel,

1802
01:33:07,240 --> 01:33:09,240
"What have they done to what we had?"

1803
01:33:10,070 --> 01:33:13,240
They have such a tremendous heritage, you are just a shoot,

1804
01:33:14,080 --> 01:33:17,150
you are just the outside, you are the tree,

1805
01:33:17,240 --> 01:33:20,160
we are the roots, you can't live without us,

1806
01:33:21,010 --> 01:33:25,180
we are your roots and these roots I see I can't understand.

1807
01:33:34,040 --> 01:33:39,020
Still it's all right, it's the concern of a Mother.

1808
01:33:40,030 --> 01:33:42,060
Let's have it. Now, put your hands towards Me, please.

1809
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:45,030
All of you take out your shoes. You must have seeking.

1810
01:33:45,110 --> 01:33:46,060
If you have no seeking,

1811
01:33:46,170 --> 01:33:48,220
what's the use of coming to My program?
