WEBVTT

03:58.636 --> 04:00.730
Something wrong.

04:01.904 --> 04:05.387
Who has made those with the things…
(hindi).

04:07.849 --> 04:13.028
You should put more of cotton in that,
you see, slips back. (Hindi)

04:19.247 --> 04:21.802
Can you get it done by the… (hindi).

04:44.183 --> 04:46.566
You for pujas you must use Indian girls,
better,

04:46.766 --> 04:49.206
they know all these things better you see.

04:49.406 --> 04:54.290
They said that nobody asked us, so
they just sit on the fence.

06:47.151 --> 06:51.304
They would think that we should not come
forward, because they’ll think

06:51.504 --> 06:54.679
these people are talking too much,
these Indians,

06:54.879 --> 06:58.563
so… I mean, they – when they have to come
they should come.

07:03.819 --> 07:08.000
You can see, yesterday’s film, that we
have a tradition,

07:08.200 --> 07:13.100
you see, we know all these things, isn’t it?
This has been there in that country,

07:13.300 --> 07:19.793
so they should tell you, and you should
not mind that.

07:20.678 --> 07:27.043
They also have the same fear as you have
that they will say “You have a ego”.

07:27.436 --> 07:32.040
I don’t know how to go about with anything.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.605
It’s quite warm. (Hindi)

10:17.980 --> 10:20.261
It’s alright.

10:36.008 --> 10:41.202
I’ll teach you how to make this, alright?
May God bless you.

10:59.674 --> 11:05.860
Today I was thinking that we’ll do the puja
to Mahalakshmi. Will be better,

11:06.060 --> 11:12.155
so that we'll understand what is Vishwa
Nirmala Dharma is.

11:15.583 --> 11:22.181
As you know, the Mahalakshmi principle lies
within all of you, in the center.

11:22.381 --> 11:28.828
And once you are fed up with the falsehood,

11:29.028 --> 11:35.999
and also with the hypocrisy of people,

11:36.993 --> 11:41.654
you start seeking the truth within.

11:41.854 --> 11:49.168
That's how a new category of people are
born, who are called as seekers - sadhakas.

11:49.368 --> 11:53.331
They are very different from others.

11:54.128 --> 12:01.783
They don't care for any material gain

12:02.550 --> 12:10.640
or any power, position.

12:10.840 --> 12:19.110
They want to seek the truth and this
category is the one you are,

12:19.310 --> 12:23.328
and that's why you have come to Sahaja
Yoga.

12:24.258 --> 12:28.641
This comes from your past lives also.

12:28.841 --> 12:31.817
For many people, I think, it's their
past life

12:32.017 --> 12:35.713
which has brought this seeking in them.

12:35.913 --> 12:41.526
Also the affluence through which you have
gone, you got fed up with it,

12:41.726 --> 12:45.653
and you are seeking the truth.

12:47.801 --> 12:52.788
Also, there are people, like in India,
where the tradition is to seek the truth,

12:52.988 --> 12:56.855
from very childhood you are told that money
is not everything,

12:57.055 --> 13:00.374
power is not everything, it’s all falsehood,
you must seek the truth.

13:00.574 --> 13:02.427
So, you are ingrained with it.

13:02.627 --> 13:07.693
These are called as good conditionings,
'su-sanskara'.

13:07.893 --> 13:22.226
Now, if it is the - just a fashion sort
of a thing,

13:23.329 --> 13:26.812
that you get into fashion, that let us seek
the truth

13:27.012 --> 13:33.020
because everybody is talking about truth,
let us have this as a fashion

13:33.220 --> 13:36.928
because everybody is doing it, you see.

13:37.128 --> 13:46.260
Then it can be very dangerous. Such people
get lost.

13:46.460 --> 13:53.185
I've seen people who were drug addicts,
who came to us first in England.

13:53.896 --> 13:56.876
And I was surprised that they were really
seekers,

13:57.076 --> 14:01.366
and they were not taking drugs because
of fashion.

14:01.566 --> 14:05.324
They were just taking it, because they
thought, by taking drugs,

14:05.524 --> 14:10.636
they will get into their Mahalakshmi
principle.

14:11.345 --> 14:16.703
Very intelligent, educated, very smart,
I should say,

14:16.903 --> 14:21.548
people became hippies and they started
taking drugs.

14:21.748 --> 14:29.431
I discovered that their seeking was only
that they should find the truth.

14:29.631 --> 14:33.987
But they had no idea as to what is
the truth is.

14:34.187 --> 14:38.743
So, this Mahalakshmi principle was born
within them.

14:38.943 --> 14:41.932
Sort of started manifesting,

14:42.132 --> 14:46.521
that 'beyond all this there must be
something'.

14:48.256 --> 14:53.904
This category of people are everywhere
in the world.

14:54.768 --> 15:01.536
Especially, I was surprised, in Russia,
where there is no talk of God,

15:01.736 --> 15:04.787
there is no talk of religion.

15:06.643 --> 15:12.813
They are even better than Indians in
understanding Sahaja Yoga.

15:13.013 --> 15:20.507
So the conditionings of every country
has also hampered

15:20.707 --> 15:26.154
the progress of Sahaja Yoga within you
and outside.

15:27.217 --> 15:31.092
So now, first of all to understand
Mahalakshmi principle

15:31.292 --> 15:36.246
we must know that we have two other
channels into which we can jump.

15:36.446 --> 15:39.136
One is the left another is the right

15:39.336 --> 15:44.464
and it depends on what sort of a background
you had in this life.

15:44.664 --> 15:48.360
Because of your background in last life,
you have come to the right path.

15:48.560 --> 15:54.977
But last life is been (being?) covered
by this life.

15:55.177 --> 16:00.941
The surroundings, the country in which you
are born, your friends, parents,

16:01.141 --> 16:08.608
the society in which you lived, has
dominated you in so many ways

16:09.787 --> 16:19.746
that the Mahalakshmi principle doesn't
express itself in that full power

16:19.946 --> 16:23.629
which should really suck in everything else

16:23.829 --> 16:29.642
and put you onto the throne of a sahaja yogi.

16:31.111 --> 16:36.118
So you find people - yesterday there were
so many people for example,

16:36.318 --> 16:42.872
very nice people, they were all seekers
of many lives who came there,

16:43.072 --> 16:49.510
but we do not know how many will come
to Sahaja Yoga

16:49.710 --> 16:54.030
and how many will settle down in Sahaja Yoga,

16:55.147 --> 17:02.239
how many will achieve doubtless awareness.

17:02.805 --> 17:10.643
Again the same problem, that they
start getting

17:11.397 --> 17:16.665
into the habits formed by the left side

17:16.865 --> 17:22.757
or into the ego formed by the right side.

17:22.957 --> 17:27.841
Now for a Sahaja Yogi to keep his
Mahalakshmi principle all right -

17:28.041 --> 17:34.133
has to always introspect, not to look
at others but to introspect.

17:34.333 --> 17:36.834
"What am I doing?

17:37.034 --> 17:42.830
Am I in the left side or on the right side?

17:43.030 --> 17:45.464
Which side [am] I moving?

17:45.664 --> 17:54.203
What side I’m following? Am I in the center?"

17:56.039 --> 18:02.417
Now how will you judge? The best is to feel
your vibrations,

18:02.617 --> 18:08.634
feel your vibrations. But sometimes you
go so far

18:08.834 --> 18:13.120
to the left or to the right, that you just
do not feel vibrations.

18:13.320 --> 18:17.861
Your Mahalakshmi principle is not working.

18:18.061 --> 18:23.575
Then you go on. It's like a complete
derailment, I should say,

18:23.775 --> 18:29.127
a kind of a slope on which you just go on
falling on to that.

18:30.261 --> 18:33.843
So all these conditionings we should
watch out,

18:34.043 --> 18:38.481
in ourselves and in others - how we have
got these problems

18:38.681 --> 18:43.660
that we slip out from the central path.
Imagine a train is going

18:43.860 --> 18:49.983
on a proper railway track and suddenly
it starts moving this way or that way.

18:50.183 --> 18:56.338
So, where will it end up? Into destruction
going. But you have a way

18:56.538 --> 19:03.870
of arranging that this derailment can be
brought back to the middle path.

19:04.070 --> 19:09.816
So in a very detached way if you look
at yourself like a witness

19:10.016 --> 19:13.181
and see for yourself, not about others...
even when I give lectures

19:13.381 --> 19:15.233
people start saying, "Oh Mother is saying
about somebody else."

19:15.433 --> 19:19.959
No, I am saying about you, yourself.
So you watch out that,

19:20.159 --> 19:27.715
"Are you in the center or are you going
to the left or to the right."

19:28.122 --> 19:34.449
First of all, those who are in the center
should not have any physical problems.

19:34.649 --> 19:39.782
Should be able to completely cure
themselves.

19:39.982 --> 19:44.322
If not others, they should be able to cure
themselves.

19:44.522 --> 19:53.703
Secondly, a person who is in the center
is a very peaceful person.

19:53.903 --> 19:58.014
He is never angry. He might put up a show
that you are angry.

19:58.214 --> 20:04.075
But he doesn't get involved into anger
or any emotions whatsoever.

20:04.275 --> 20:12.277
He just watches and he can act. He can act
to be in that feeling

20:12.477 --> 20:20.140
of temper also lust, greed, anything -
but just to act.

20:20.340 --> 20:25.199
Because sometimes this acting is needed
so he can use it.

20:25.399 --> 20:29.335
But you should be sure, first of all, that
you are completely detached.

20:29.535 --> 20:34.441
So first of all, before acting you must
become a master of acting.

20:34.641 --> 20:41.471
And for that you have to become your Self.
If you become your Self

20:41.671 --> 20:49.160
then you are a master and you can see
where are you going.

20:49.989 --> 20:57.470
Now the difference between a sahaja yogi
and a sahaja yogi who is like this,

20:57.670 --> 21:03.765
as you say, is this, that he is capable
of going to the left or to the right.

21:03.965 --> 21:07.530
They are not solidly sahaja yogis,

21:08.180 --> 21:11.267
and they go on like this and there is
no progress. Imagine

21:11.467 --> 21:14.764
any airplane which is wobbling like that:
will be on the ground only.

21:14.964 --> 21:21.593
Nobody will be able to put it up in the air,

21:21.793 --> 21:26.104
because God knows what time -
when will it fall down.

21:26.304 --> 21:30.134
So for any machinery, we have to fix it up
properly first,

21:30.334 --> 21:35.985
before we start working it out.
To fix up our

21:37.549 --> 21:42.172
Mahalakshmi principle, you have to see
that your physical being

21:42.372 --> 21:45.539
is all right, is normal, no problem.

21:45.739 --> 21:49.600
I am not meaning the modern ways
of looking at health

21:49.800 --> 21:52.951
but that you should feel healthy and happy.

21:53.151 --> 21:57.531
You should feel that there is no problem
with your physical being.

21:57.731 --> 22:01.864
But if you are a complaining type (like)
I am here paining, I’m paining there,

22:02.064 --> 22:05.248
then there is something wrong with you.

22:07.574 --> 22:13.916
This is the first criteria that you are
in the center.

22:14.914 --> 22:21.079
Then your attention should be more
towards nature -

22:21.279 --> 22:26.639
how the nature is, how it is blossoming,
how it is working out.

22:26.839 --> 22:30.261
It should be towards the sky, stars
and things.

22:30.461 --> 22:35.451
Just to enjoy all the creation that is
around, just to enjoy it.

22:35.651 --> 22:42.435
That’s an enjoyment which is really
so surprisingly deep.

22:42.635 --> 22:46.148
When you see something, beautiful scene
or something -

22:46.348 --> 22:52.215
you go to a very beautiful place, then
a kind of a joy that pours in you

22:52.415 --> 22:56.784
from your Sahastrara, that also you
must experience.

22:56.984 --> 23:00.260
Also you must experience your thoughtless
awareness,

23:00.460 --> 23:05.597
that is when you look at something beautiful
you should suddenly become thoughtless.

23:05.797 --> 23:12.498
Just start seeing it. The whole joy will
start pouring on you.

23:12.698 --> 23:20.545
Then another thing is that you should not
differentiate between religions.

23:20.745 --> 23:24.012
You should not condemn any religion.

23:24.212 --> 23:29.039
But the people who are stupid and call
themselves religious,

23:29.239 --> 23:31.682
they can be condemned, because they are
stupid.

23:31.882 --> 23:35.008
They have not followed the principle
of religion at all.

23:35.208 --> 23:40.380
They are not realized souls and that's what
they are making a mistake.

23:40.580 --> 23:44.718
So that's all right. For example churches
can be condemned,

23:44.918 --> 23:50.823
but not Christ, not the Bible, not at all,
never.

23:51.023 --> 23:55.466
So, when you see to the roots - roots are
all right, but now as I said,

23:55.666 --> 24:00.052
that these flowers have been plucked
by people and they are fighting.

24:00.252 --> 24:04.550
So you should never condemn any incarnation,

24:04.750 --> 24:10.892
any religion, any prophet.

24:11.092 --> 24:14.146
I mean you will not condemn. It is not
question of I’m saying, "Don't do it".

24:14.346 --> 24:18.723
You will just not do it. You will respect
all of them automatically,

24:18.923 --> 24:23.221
because now you are born into it. If you,
say, are a Christian,

24:23.421 --> 24:26.369
you will respect Hindu scriptures.

24:26.569 --> 24:30.306
If you are a Hindu you’ll respect
an Islamic Quran.

24:30.506 --> 24:33.275
That has to be there. If it is not so,

24:33.475 --> 24:38.036
then please know that you are not yet a sahaja yogi.

24:38.236 --> 24:42.464
There should be no malice about any
religion whatsoever.

24:42.664 --> 24:45.869
No religion has done any wrong so far.

24:46.069 --> 24:50.269
It's the people who follow them in a wrong
way, use it for money,

24:50.469 --> 24:57.237
use it for power and also are stupid.
For them it's different.

24:57.437 --> 25:03.393
But for you, every religion is your
own religion.

25:03.593 --> 25:07.285
So we cannot be fundamentalist.

25:07.485 --> 25:10.790
We cannot fight for fundamentalism.

25:10.990 --> 25:15.636
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma which is based
on the Mahalakshmi principle,

25:15.836 --> 25:23.367
is the essence of all the religions,
the truth of all the religions.

25:23.567 --> 25:29.157
And we seek with our pursuits

25:29.357 --> 25:34.041
what are the common points in all these
religions. We try to neutralise

25:34.241 --> 25:37.799
which are not common points

25:37.999 --> 25:42.547
and find out with our research/pursuits

25:42.747 --> 25:49.845
that this one was not the correct thing,
but is not in the religion,

25:50.045 --> 25:55.653
people are following like that. There are
so many things you can find out.

25:55.853 --> 26:02.334
If in the Bible, if you remove Paul
you will cleanse most of it.

26:02.534 --> 26:06.592
If Paul is not there, I tell you, most
of the Christianity can be cleansed out,

26:06.792 --> 26:10.613
because he started confessions, he started
all this nonsense.

26:10.813 --> 26:13.916
He started making people feel guilty,
I mean,

26:14.116 --> 26:18.340
and treating women as nothing.
All Mr. Paul has done it

26:18.540 --> 26:23.641
and he had no right to be there in the
Bible ibecause he never knew Christ.

26:24.704 --> 26:29.065
He was an epileptic and he saw some cross
means some sort of a...

26:29.265 --> 26:35.208
I don't know how far it is truth. But he
said he saw a cross. So what?

26:35.408 --> 26:38.990
Seeing the cross doesn't mean you become
the cross.

26:39.190 --> 26:46.082
Also he wanted to jump on the platform.
Nice platform is made, all right, for you.

26:46.282 --> 26:54.802
And he has powers, and he wants to have
powers, so, he jumps on the platform.

26:55.002 --> 26:59.361
Then he organizes Christianity.
All his mistery.

26:59.561 --> 27:02.363
Never in the Bible is said, never
Christ said,

27:02.563 --> 27:07.027
that you should organize Christianity,
nor has He said

27:07.227 --> 27:11.815
that you should confess or you should
feel guilty.

27:12.015 --> 27:16.028
All the time He has been talking
of forgiveness.

27:16.228 --> 27:19.965
In that short time also, He has given
the truth to us.

27:20.165 --> 27:27.919
But I mean, if somebody wants to interpret,
then it goes wrong.

27:28.119 --> 27:33.130
So this - another point of a sahaja yogi is,
whatever I say

27:33.330 --> 27:37.745
they don't have to interpret, they know it
exactly what I say.

27:37.945 --> 27:42.074
If they start interpreting, then there is
something wrong with them.

27:42.274 --> 27:46.356
Their brains are not all right, they are
not normal. You cannot interpret Me.

27:46.556 --> 27:49.974
Whatever I say, I say in a very simple
English language.

27:50.174 --> 27:53.204
I do not use Shakespearean language
or something like that.

27:53.404 --> 28:01.027
I modulated My Standard of English up to
the normal common people’s language,

28:01.227 --> 28:04.293
and if you start interpreting it,

28:04.493 --> 28:09.198
that means something definitely very,
very wrong with you.

28:09.398 --> 28:12.645
There is nothing to interpret. I am saying
straightforward things

28:12.845 --> 28:17.535
which need not be interpreted. This is
a very important thing.

28:17.735 --> 28:24.484
But many sahaja yogi's who are half-baked,
I should say, start interpreting Me,

28:24.684 --> 28:27.063
because they think they have brains
to interpret.

28:27.263 --> 28:33.510
You have no brains of that caliber that
you can interpret Me.

28:33.710 --> 28:37.176
There are no interpretations. Whatever
I have said, I have said it

28:37.376 --> 28:40.097
and there is no need to interpret.

28:40.297 --> 28:44.159
This is one of the signs that you are
not in the center.

28:44.359 --> 28:49.821
Either you have been possessed or you
have become egoistical.

28:50.021 --> 28:57.219
So, one, to keep yourself in the center,
to be solidly sahaja yogis,

28:57.419 --> 29:01.989
first of all there should be no
interpretations of what I say.

29:02.189 --> 29:06.011
If you think that I am meaning something
else, you can write to Me,

29:06.211 --> 29:10.531
but don't interpret and start a big
organization

29:10.731 --> 29:18.210
against Sahaja Yoga. This is the greatest
mistake that people do it.

29:18.410 --> 29:22.866
I have told many people that you should not
give lectures about Sahaja Yoga.

29:23.066 --> 29:26.081
Because once they start giving lectures,
also sometimes they get

29:26.281 --> 29:31.172
into derailment. Either they get egoistical
or they say things,

29:31.372 --> 29:36.692
as they say, out of their hats, which I
have never said, which are not to be said.

29:36.892 --> 29:40.250
So unless and until you are a solid
sahaja yogi,

29:40.450 --> 29:44.313
I think you should not talk about Sahaja
Yoga. Best is to give realization.

29:44.513 --> 29:50.186
Though you are half-baked, you can give
realization. That's one point for sure.

29:50.386 --> 29:53.624
And those who will get will remain
sahaja yogis.

29:53.824 --> 29:58.102
I have seen people who have given
realization to others are gone cases,

29:58.302 --> 30:03.027
while those whom they have given
are perfect.

30:05.397 --> 30:09.972
Now when somebody gives you
the realization, he is not your guru

30:10.172 --> 30:16.059
by any chance. He is not your guru and have
no sort of a awe

30:16.259 --> 30:21.051
or an obligation towards that person
who has given you realization.

30:21.251 --> 30:26.779
If you do that way, then the ego
of that man wouldn't go away

30:26.979 --> 30:30.407
and you will have conditioning.

30:30.607 --> 30:33.916
You will always stand by that person
though he has done wrong.

30:34.116 --> 30:36.890
Though he is absolutely not a sahaja yogi,
you will stand by that person.

30:37.090 --> 30:42.281
With him you also move to the direction
in which he has moved.

30:42.481 --> 30:46.616
So in Mahalakshmi principle, one has
to be careful, absolutely,

30:46.816 --> 30:50.340
to see where are we going.

30:52.177 --> 30:55.606
Now the group system starts, also with
the same.

30:55.806 --> 31:00.344
There is a big fraternity of 'bhoots',
I must tell you.

31:02.275 --> 31:05.998
If you go to the left, all the leftist
will join you.

31:06.198 --> 31:09.193
If you go to the right, all the rightist
will join you.

31:09.393 --> 31:13.613
Then they’ll fight among themselves
and get out of it.

31:14.677 --> 31:20.692
Now for sahaja yogis, who believe
in fighting back, in grouping back,

31:20.892 --> 31:24.933
they should know, they have derailed.
Maybe they were very intelligent,

31:25.133 --> 31:29.611
they thought they could do that, maybe.
But none intelligence,

31:29.811 --> 31:34.982
none of them are above the Divine
intelligence.

31:35.182 --> 31:37.936
But when you start moving out
of Mahalakshmi thing,

31:38.136 --> 31:43.263
you become like a common person, even
worse than a common person, I would say.

31:43.463 --> 31:49.912
So then you are grabbed by the negative
forces which are around us.

31:50.112 --> 31:56.635
Just like all others are grabbed, you are
also grabbed.

31:57.040 --> 32:03.412
There are conditionings, which also
we should see “do we have”.

32:03.612 --> 32:08.481
Say a western person must see western
conditionings

32:08.681 --> 32:11.577
very clearly. What are these
conditionings? Because we are

32:11.777 --> 32:15.985
seekers of truth, we do not belong
to any country. We belong

32:16.185 --> 32:20.458
to the universe, Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.
We do not belong to Australia,

32:20.658 --> 32:24.402
we do not belong to Brisbane. You see
this belonging

32:24.602 --> 32:29.600
becomes so small and so mean that
ultimately it will become, we belong

32:29.800 --> 32:35.589
to this street and then we belong to this
room, and we belong to this bathroom.

32:35.789 --> 32:38.817
Start going down, down, down, so much.

32:39.017 --> 32:43.612
While is it Vishwa Nirmala Dharma. Means
it is a universal religion,

32:43.812 --> 32:48.144
we belong to the universe. We are part
and parcel of the universe,

32:48.344 --> 32:54.301
not only belonging to one place or one
location. We cannot.

32:54.501 --> 32:59.622
Now we have gone into eternal life. We have
gone to something that is unlimited.

32:59.822 --> 33:02.533
So we belong to this universe.

33:02.733 --> 33:06.745
Once you realize that you belong to this
universe, you should also know

33:06.945 --> 33:10.771
what conditionings are still sticking on
to us

33:10.971 --> 33:17.370
from this country, from this culture,
from this place,

33:17.570 --> 33:20.818
from this household, from this family,

33:21.018 --> 33:25.268
like a little lotus that comes out
of the mud.

33:25.468 --> 33:29.963
Slowly, slowly it throws away all the mud
that is sticking on to it.

33:30.163 --> 33:35.623
Ultimately it comes out as a very
clean flower.

33:35.823 --> 33:39.212
From the mud it gets to the water,
cleanses itself

33:39.412 --> 33:43.358
and comes out as a beautiful flower,
absolutely fragrant,

33:43.558 --> 33:47.075
and then it spreads its fragrance
all around,

33:47.275 --> 33:52.009
so that, that mud also gets fragrance.

33:52.209 --> 33:56.394
That's your job. That’s what you have
to be.

33:56.594 --> 34:00.730
Because you are not a seeker of truth
for yourself but for the whole world.

34:00.930 --> 34:04.033
Because you belong to Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

34:04.233 --> 34:10.116
This Mahalakshmi principle is not for you
alone, but it is for the whole world,

34:10.316 --> 34:15.060
and you have to give it to the whole world.
So now you are here

34:15.260 --> 34:20.462
forming a new kind of a race, a new kind
of a society,

34:20.662 --> 34:29.728
which is enlightened, which is standing
on the truth and love.

34:30.285 --> 34:36.698
Of course, you must understand that
there should be compassion.

34:36.898 --> 34:42.768
Look at that child, my God!

34:45.058 --> 34:50.785
That’s another condition of the children
here. They must do something to get hurt.

34:50.985 --> 34:55.730
It’s very common. All the time, they do
things that will hurt them.

34:55.930 --> 34:59.515
They cannot sit quiet. It’s very surprising.

34:59.715 --> 35:03.824
In India you find children will sit quiet
for three hours - four hours,

35:04.024 --> 35:08.108
as long as the pujas are. Now here
the children are, I don't know

35:08.308 --> 35:12.136
but I am going to find out a solution
for this. They just cannot keep quiet.

35:12.336 --> 35:17.734
And now in America, they are suffering
from overactivity, is a disease,

35:17.934 --> 35:21.114
it is a disease now. They don't know what
to do with the overactive children.

35:21.314 --> 35:28.364
They are overactive. But I think I'll be
able to find out some solution for that.

35:28.564 --> 35:33.739
But as far as you are concerned you are
your own solution.

35:33.939 --> 35:43.163
You can watch yourself. You want to be people
who are spiritually very well equipped.

35:43.363 --> 35:48.009
For that equipment you must see yourself,
where are you,

35:48.209 --> 35:54.830
what are you doing? What's your style
of life?

35:55.030 --> 35:59.300
A solid sahaja yogi or a yogini everyone
knows all over the world.

35:59.500 --> 36:04.058
They are solid. Nothing can deter them.

36:05.090 --> 36:09.255
And you can also know about yourself.
It’s not that you cannot know.

36:09.455 --> 36:16.438
All of you can know yourself very well
because now you are quite sensitive

36:16.638 --> 36:21.064
and you have your own centers enlightened
by Mahalakshmi principle.

36:21.264 --> 36:27.634
The Kundalini has definitely enlightened
your Mahalakshmi principle.

36:27.834 --> 36:31.348
So you can always make out where are we,
what my chakras are,

36:31.548 --> 36:37.315
how are they catching, where are they
catching. Instead of avoiding that,

36:37.515 --> 36:42.387
you just work it out - what's the problem,
where is the problem?

36:42.587 --> 36:47.520
Once you work it out then you will be
surprised that,

36:47.720 --> 36:53.035
as soon as your desire goes inward,

36:53.235 --> 36:59.375
the Kundalini itself will rush through
and She will cleanse your chakras.

36:59.575 --> 37:02.817
As I was telling you, we do not know
our powers.

37:03.017 --> 37:07.868
Only one thing you have to do is
to desire. You have to desire that,

37:08.068 --> 37:13.037
let my vibrations be all right,
let my chakras be cleared out,

37:13.237 --> 37:18.245
let me be in the center, in the balance.
Just you have to desire.

37:18.445 --> 37:23.898
I mean it’s such a simple thing to desire.
But that also we cannot do.

37:24.098 --> 37:28.261
Our desires are something else.
Not what we have to be.

37:28.461 --> 37:34.819
Just you have to desire that: let me be
a clean sahaja ogi.

37:35.019 --> 37:38.776
Let me be a solid Sahaja Yogi.
There are mediocres

37:38.976 --> 37:43.103
who can never be. I am not talking
about them. But so many

37:43.303 --> 37:49.401
can be very high up, can be very high up
in Sahaja Yoga.

37:49.601 --> 37:54.517
But their desires are not yet being
fully manifested. .

37:54.717 --> 38:01.716
Then there is a damping effect of so many
things I have told you about.

38:01.916 --> 38:04.923
So supposing you have to catch the plane,

38:05.123 --> 38:09.044
then you don't get down on the way
somewhere and stay out.

38:09.244 --> 38:12.508
In the same way, when your Kundalini
has to rise,

38:12.708 --> 38:16.505
you can see everything that’s happening.
But keep yourself aloof,

38:16.705 --> 38:19.385
because you have to reach your point
and that is

38:19.585 --> 38:26.800
through this Mahalakshmi principle.
It is a principle that is so detached.

38:27.000 --> 38:30.417
It is the nourishing principle within us,

38:30.617 --> 38:34.844
which nourishes our centers, which
nourishes our character,

38:35.044 --> 38:39.914
which nourishes our religion, that is
Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

38:40.114 --> 38:45.003
It nourishes everything. It nourishes
our brain, our intellect,

38:45.203 --> 38:50.089
everything, it nourishes this Mahalakshmi
principle, above all

38:50.289 --> 38:54.714
it is the balancing. It balances you.

38:54.914 --> 39:02.397
If you are overdoing something, then
it gives you a kind of a push.

39:02.597 --> 39:09.736
If you are not doing anything, again it
works in such a manner that it balances you.

39:10.432 --> 39:14.831
So this is the guiding factor for you,
this Mahalakshmi principle,

39:15.031 --> 39:19.664
which works out everything you can say

39:19.864 --> 39:26.519
that is balancing, the equilibrium
and the wisdom.

39:26.719 --> 39:34.206
As the light of Mahalakshmi principle
starts, the wisdom dawns upon you.

39:34.406 --> 39:39.780
But the greatest of all is the love.
Love for God,

39:39.980 --> 39:47.479
love for truth and you thrive on that love.
Just you are there.

39:47.679 --> 39:50.361
I mean, I asked him, "Why so many
are here?" They said,

39:50.561 --> 39:56.297
for the puja. Why? This is a sign that
you are great sahaja yogis,

39:56.497 --> 40:00.646
that you are here because of puja, that
you understand the value of puja

40:00.846 --> 40:05.560
and that you need the puja, that you enjoy
because it is nourishing to you.

40:05.760 --> 40:12.090
Is a very good thing because that shows
that you are very much there.

40:12.290 --> 40:15.968
You are very much understanding
the importance of right things

40:16.168 --> 40:20.085
and you want to do it at any cost.

40:20.285 --> 40:27.158
All these desires are significant because
they show that you are

40:27.358 --> 40:32.499
in the Mahalakshmi principle and you want
to keep on that one.

40:33.687 --> 40:40.969
I would say, there is a simple one that
you can do is just to be on My Kundalini.

40:41.169 --> 40:44.936
If you can, just try to be in My Kundalini

40:45.136 --> 40:47.762
- on My Kundalini. Just put attention.
You can, all of you can.

40:47.962 --> 40:52.349
Any problem, just put your attention onto
My Kundalini. And you will be all right.

40:52.549 --> 40:58.158
You will just become thoughtless, because
there is no thought.

40:59.713 --> 41:03.887
This is the best way to do it, is to just
solve all problems

41:04.087 --> 41:10.590
by putting attention on My Kundalini and
by that your ego will definitely dissolve,

41:10.790 --> 41:13.495
because then you will know that Mother
is doing everything, I am doing nothing,

41:13.695 --> 41:17.447
so why should I be proud of it.

41:17.647 --> 41:22.499
Also the conditionings will dissolve because

41:22.699 --> 41:29.056
my Kundalini is absolutely pure. That’s -
It is not attached to anyone.

41:29.256 --> 41:34.230
It is not even attached to Sahaja Yoga.
It is not attached to anyone.

41:34.430 --> 41:38.332
The job it has got to do is to nourish
everything.

41:38.532 --> 41:43.657
If it can nourish well and good. If it does
not nourish, well and good.

41:43.857 --> 41:47.920
It depends on what do you want. You want
to be nourished - all right,

41:48.120 --> 41:52.976
so the Kundalini is there, the Mahalakshmi
principle is there. It will nourish you.

41:53.176 --> 41:57.272
But if you don't want, nobody is going
to force you in any way.

41:57.472 --> 42:03.598
Nobody is going to jump on you or form
some sort of a formidable oppression.

42:03.798 --> 42:06.058
Nothing of the kind.

42:07.294 --> 42:11.151
It's just like a river Ganges, you can say,
which is flowing.

42:11.351 --> 42:15.940
Now if you want you can fill up your
pitchers.

42:16.140 --> 42:19.357
If you don't want, She is not going
to enter into your pitchers.

42:19.557 --> 42:23.777
She is not going to come in your house
and get into your pitchers.

42:23.977 --> 42:31.928
So there has to be a desire to get it and
that is what is called is 'Bhakti'.

42:32.128 --> 42:38.730
'Bhakti' is the desire, the devotion to get

42:41.753 --> 42:46.951
the joy of Bhakti. It's such a beautiful
thing.

42:47.151 --> 42:52.105
I wish, I could do the Bhakti to someone,
but I can't do.

42:52.305 --> 42:55.825
Because I see you, when you are in Bhakti,
you just get lost into it.

42:56.025 --> 42:59.849
So much you enjoy, such an enjoyable thing.

43:00.049 --> 43:02.853
Then you don't think, you just enjoy
the Bhakti.

43:03.053 --> 43:11.614
And that’s what is the most coveted,
highest state

43:11.814 --> 43:18.426
where you are just one with the divine
and just swimming in the ocean of joy.

43:18.626 --> 43:21.805
So this Mahalakshmi principle is to be
preserved

43:22.005 --> 43:26.365
and has to be always watched
and looked into.

43:26.565 --> 43:30.267
And the blessings of Mahalakshmi are
so many that,

43:30.467 --> 43:32.772
I tell you, I cannot even tell them

43:32.972 --> 43:35.465
in one lecture. I'll have to give at least
ten lectures.

43:35.665 --> 43:41.153
But you yourself know what are the blessings
of this Mahalakshmi principle is.

43:41.353 --> 43:45.640
The greatest is the complete
self-contentedness,

43:45.840 --> 43:49.124
is absolutely self-contented.

43:49.324 --> 43:55.877
You don't want to grab something, you
don't want to run after something,

43:56.077 --> 44:00.101
you are just self contended. You don't
want any publicity,

44:00.301 --> 44:08.082
you don't want any comfort, nothing.
You are comfortable in your spirit.

44:08.282 --> 44:13.928
This is the greatest blessing of this
Mahalakshmi principle,

44:14.128 --> 44:20.426
and if that is so, then why not we look
after our Mahalakshmi principle

44:20.626 --> 44:23.900
and forget about the rest.

44:24.100 --> 44:28.043
Last of all, when it enters into your brain,

44:28.243 --> 44:37.796
then the Virata is manifesting and you
become collective, absolutely collective.

44:38.447 --> 44:41.314
It’s such a beautiful thing
is to be collective.

44:41.514 --> 44:44.152
There was a girl who went to Sicily

44:44.352 --> 44:47.533
and she was in a restaurant eating
something alone.

44:47.733 --> 44:52.842
And then she looked at somebody else
and that girl also looked at her.

44:53.042 --> 44:58.579
And this one got up and came to her and
she said... they were not wearing badges.

44:58.779 --> 45:05.432
They said, 'Have you been to Shri Mataji -
Yes, Have you been - Yes.'

45:05.632 --> 45:10.920
'We are Sahaja Yogis - Yes.' And then they
just embraced each other with such joy.

45:11.120 --> 45:16.612
In a far-fetched place somewhere in Sicily,
in some restaurant, imagine!

45:16.812 --> 45:22.810
They just got lost. The feeling of fondness,
the brotherhood, the friendship

45:23.011 --> 45:28.598
is so great and so joyous. You don't then
consider from what country you are,

45:28.798 --> 45:31.629
from where do you come, what is
the color of your skin,

45:31.829 --> 45:34.836
or what is the religion you had followed,

45:35.036 --> 45:41.679
what your parents are. You just enjoy
meeting people.

45:41.879 --> 45:48.103
This friendship, this joy comes from
the same Mahalakshmi principle,

45:48.303 --> 45:52.842
when She enlightens your Sahastrara.

45:53.042 --> 45:57.364
In the Sahastrara you get this feeling
of the whole

45:57.564 --> 46:01.027
and the feeling of the whole is something
so great.

46:01.227 --> 46:05.039
Individualism, people talk, but it is
against the principle of whole.

46:05.239 --> 46:09.467
Who do not know the whole you see
talk of individualism.

46:09.667 --> 46:15.331
This individualism which has worked
all kinds of dangers for us -

46:15.531 --> 46:19.071
now, we have to know that we are one
with the whole.

46:19.271 --> 46:26.789
Of course, we are individuals in the sense
that we have different, different faces,

46:26.989 --> 46:30.889
different clothes, different living,
different relationships,

46:31.089 --> 46:35.583
but we belong to the whole.

46:36.388 --> 46:41.483
And this Virata’s feeling that we are part
and parcel of the whole

46:41.683 --> 46:46.127
gives you complete peace and complete
protection.

46:46.327 --> 46:51.874
You never feel that something can happen
to you – never feel.

46:52.898 --> 46:55.300
Some accident will take place, all right,
will take place,

46:55.500 --> 46:58.952
but nothing will happen to me.
I am a sahaja yogi.

46:59.766 --> 47:04.951
So many people have gained like this,
by allowing themselves

47:05.151 --> 47:10.489
to be completely looked after by this
Mahalakshmi principle.

47:10.689 --> 47:15.757
Just surrender to the Mahalakshmi principle
means that you give up your ego

47:15.957 --> 47:19.975
and you give up your conditionings.
You give up both the things.

47:20.175 --> 47:22.621
Just surrendering to your Mahalakshmi
principle.

47:22.821 --> 47:26.957
That's why Mahalakshmi is so important.

47:27.976 --> 47:29.210
May God bless you all.
