1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000

4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
1984-0708 Public Program 1 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,892
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:19,892
In the previous two lectures I told you how to understand the experience of truth.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,892
In the first one, we came to the conclusion that if we have to feel the truth,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,892
it’s not our only mental acceptance that it is truth, or our mental projection that it is truth,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,892
but you have to feel it on your central nervous system.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,892
In the second lecture I told you that when you feel the truth through your central nervous system

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,892
in your evolutionary process, then you become something.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,892
You become, you become is the point. Is not that you think you are like this or like that,

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:37,892
but you really become something. Like a flower becomes a fruit or an egg becomes a chick.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,892
You have to become something in your awareness, and this new awareness is the awareness of collective consciousness.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,892
Where you can feel yourself, what’s the problem with you and you can feel others, on your fingertips.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,892
This is a very good English idiom they use, on your fingertips.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,892
I mean somebody must have thought of Sahaja Yoga when they formed this I am sure.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,892
To use this, you should know it on your fingertips.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,892
Now what does that mean? We have never thought of it, we always say so, we should know them on our fingertips,

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,892
but actually you feel them on your fingertips.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,892
The different centres within you and the centres in other people.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,892
As hot or cold, may be as heavy, burning; this you just feel it. You can feel it, others can feel it,

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,892
children can feel it and everybody feels the same, because truth is absolute and is for everyone.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,892
Whether you have a different caste, community, race, religion, nationality,

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,892
all kinds of superficial things, which divides human beings, everyone feels the same.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,892
For example, supposing you put a finger to this, (Candle flame) you are going to feel hot.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,892
Because you have a different hair style, you are not going to feel something different,

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,892
it’s like that. Truth has to be that way, and that is what is the experience of truth.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,892
And once you know you have to know the truth and nothing else but the truth.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,892
When you decide in your mind and be honest about it then when you see it, it is very obvious.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,892
It has to be obvious, it cannot be secretive. It cannot be, it has to be obvious, apparent,

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,892
absolutely known to your central nervous system.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,892
So you know the absolute as I told you. Like a computer you start working, you ask any questions,

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,892
absolute questions and the answers come to you, as cool vibrations for yes and as hot vibrations for no

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,892
and sometimes the vibrations stops to say that absolutely no.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,892
But it can be some blister sometimes a little bit, to say that it’s satanic.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,892
And you can decode it yourself and see for yourself.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:38,892
This is the second phase where you start knowing about others and knowing about yourself.

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,892
So you become connected with the Absolute. Absolute, means there is no question about it,

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:59,892
absolute means there is no doubt about it, absolute means it is single.

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,892
Today I have to tell you about what actually happens when this force called Kundalini within you

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,892
rises and gives you self-realization. Actually within your self what should happen?

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,892
Nobody tells you these things, I mean, they’ll say you are to be reborn, so you have a sort of a certificate,

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,892
twice born, reborn and you go about, when it’s not like that.

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,892
Supposing a monkey puts a sign-board on, “I am a human being”, does he become?

47
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,892
If we just say we are this, we are that, you are not.

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,892
For example we say we are Muslims, we are Christians, we are Hindus, we are not.

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,892
Because you have formed a group, you call yourself something, or something that you are not.

50
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,892
It’s just your own idea. How are you a Hindu? How are you a Christian?

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,892
What all these religions have said that you have to be born again.

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,892
Every religion, Jews have in a way said it too,

53
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,892
but the problem is that we don’t do what is told to us, we just form a group.

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,892
Group can be made out of anything nonsensical like, I met some other people the other day

55
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,892
and they told Me our group is called as Knives and Fork.

56
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,892
I said “What’s that group?” Knives and Forks, yes very good group,

57
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,892
so I said, “What is that?” “Because we put our knives and forks in a different way than others.”

58
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,892
I said ” But what’s the use?” “No, we form a very strong group.” “For what?”

59
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,892
“We can form a political party tomorrow.”

60
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,892
I said, “All right, go ahead with this kind of a nonsense”,

61
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,892
But it is nonsense, all this is nonsense. What is sensible is that

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,892
we have to become something more than what we are. We are human beings,

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,892
we have to become more knowledgeable, we have to become the knowledge.

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,892
That knowledge you cannot get in the libraries or from the books.

65
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,892
How do you grow into that knowledge is through this Kundalini awakening,

66
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,892
through this happening that, this Kundalini rises within you

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,892
and pierces through your fontanel bone area giving you the real baptism and not the artificial one.

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,892
The reality again. Supposing somebody doesn’t get it, all right, so he comes back on Me,

69
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,892
“Oh I never got it Mother”. Something wrong, he should get it, should get it.

70
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,892
Because we cannot give you a false certificate, you cannot give yourself a false certificate.

71
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,892
But it is very common as you see in this world, that when you listen to people who are religious,

72
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,892
you find they are horribly fanatic, funny, stupid people.

73
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,892
I mean if you want to hear about each one of them you should go to the opposite party.

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,892
Like if you want to hear about Hindus go to Muslims.

75
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,892
If you want to hear about the Muslims go to Jews and

76
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,892
if you want to hear about Jews go to say Muslims or anyone, Christians, and they’ll tell you.

77
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,892
So there’s nothing universal opinion about things.

78
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,892
It is surprising for a person who wants to see the truth in every religion,

79
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,892
he cannot understand why people belonging to religion, when God is only one,

80
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,892
why there’s a fight going on. Why this world is divided by, even religious leaders are dividing the world.

81
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:42,892
It is very amazing. So where is this religion? And what happens to our religion?

82
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:54,892
When we get our self-realization, we become the Self, the Spirit and the Spirit is untarnishable.

83
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,892
It’s untarnishable. You cannot cleanse the soap, can you?

84
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,892
But the quality of Spirit is that it cleanses you. First is it cleanses you.

85
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,892
Just like a Mother lovingly cleanses the child who has fallen somewhere in the road

86
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,892
and cleanses the clothes and makes the child absolutely neat, tidy, clean

87
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,892
and with great admiration looks at the child;

88
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,892
in the same way the Spirit bathes you with it’s beautiful blessings so that you cleanse.

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,892
And the second thing it does is to give you light.

90
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,892
Now the light doesn’t mean electrical light, it doesn’t mean the light you see inside.

91
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,892
What does this light means is your awareness itself.

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,892
Your awareness itself becomes a higher awareness by which you start seeing things clear cut.

93
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,892
Like I know somebody who came to see Me before Sahaja Yoga

94
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,892
and he met Me after say a month, he was a changed man, I could not recognize him.

95
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,892
So I said what has happened to him? He came to Me I asked him,

96
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,892
”How are you?” He said “Mother I am fine.”

97
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,892
He used to look very old and haggard and absolutely frustrated. I said “What has happened?”

98
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,892
He said “Mother you know, when I got realisation, suddenly I felt tremendous compassion for everyone

99
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,892
and I had an enemy that was my uncle and I hated him from the bottom of my heart,

100
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,892
and I used to think he has killed my mother, and I could not believe that he has not killed my mother,

101
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,892
so many people told me but still with the hatred I could not get over it.

102
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,892
I had insulted him, he had insulted me and if somebody had given me freedom with

103
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,892
a dagger I would have gone and killed him. I hated him from the bottom of my heart.

104
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,892
And all the time I thought of killing him, doing this and all the nasty things I could think of.

105
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,892
My whole mind was pre-occupied.” “So what happened?” He said,

106
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,892
“Next day I started seeing his good points, I said no he is a very generous man.

107
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,892
I have been nastier that he has been, suddenly I started feeling it, that feeling of love,

108
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,892
compassion and when I said uncle, I forgive you completely,

109
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,892
the blissfulness crawled upon me, that’s the first time I’ve felt the joy of my spirit.

110
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,892
I had said this before also but I had never felt it,

111
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,892
but first time when I said this I felt it and that bliss was so great and that joy was so great

112
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,892
I said now I must have it at any cost.

113
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,892
So next day I saw him at a race, he was a great race goer also, a very rich man.

114
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,892
I saw him and I just embraced him. I couldn’t help it. He was surprised, he looked at me,

115
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,892
he said come and have tea with me, and we are great friends now.”

116
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,892
So all that wrinkle, all that horrible anger and all that has gone away

117
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,892
and this divine, serene face was showing its beauty there.

118
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,892
But he said “I have done this before, I’ve tried to forgive him, I told myself,

119
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,892
I told many a times that he’s not killed my mother, I should not hate him.

120
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,892
I tried to convince myself, but still I could not forgive, I didn’t have the power to forgive.

121
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,892
But when I got my self-realization, suddenly the power came to me,

122
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,892
in such a gush. I have become powerful Mother.”

123
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,892
In the Sanskrit language it’s called the word Samarth,

124
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,892
Samarth means powerful but actually means Sama-Artha, it means equal to your meaning.

125
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,892
Equal to your meaning, means you become your Self. Samartha.

126
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,892
When you become yourself, you become powerful to fight your weaknesses

127
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:48,892
and you automatically do it without any trouble, spontaneously. Very easy it is to forgive.

128
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,892
Not only this, so many things there are which you just do without any difficulty.

129
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:07,892
It is very difficult before realization for a person to think that to part with your little bit of two P’s that you have,

130
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,892
even that is sometimes difficult. You think ten times, calculate it, all right,

131
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,892
if I give two P’s now how much will I get, three P’s or five P’s, all right

132
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,892
if I get three P’s no good, five P’s is all right; but after realization you just give.

133
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,892
You just give, you like to give, you love to give, you want to enjoy the giving capacity of yourself.

134
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,892
So far the acquiring, acquisition and also the capacity to preserve,

135
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,892
keep everything to yourself becomes a giving capacity.

136
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,892
And as a result of that, what you find, you are filled in.

137
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:07,892
Every sort of thing, every sort of material or physical or anything that is needed to make you happy

138
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,892
just comes down. From where, how, God alone knows because it’s only God does the job,

139
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:26,892
it’s God’s work. So the power to stand up against evil, against injustice,

140
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,892
against wrong doing just changes your priorities completely

141
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,892
and you become a powerful personality. Like Christ when He saw the prostitute,

142
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,892
Mary Magdalene, being stoned, He saw the disciple Mary Magdalene in her.

143
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,892
He stood up and He said, “Those who have not sinned can throw stones at Me.”

144
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,892
That character, that strength that stood up there,

145
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,892
and nobody could even think of throwing stones at Him.

146
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,892
This powerful personality which is compassion, which is righteous, which is virtuous,

147
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,892
starts shining through you. It’s not a quarrelsome dominating power in which we believe.

148
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,892
According to us a powerful man is the one who can dominate the whole world.

149
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,892
The power of love we have never exploited, never.

150
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,892
All our enterprises, all our worldly affairs, political, economic, are based on hatred.

151
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,892
The power of love in it’s purest from is the most powerful thing

152
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,892
and that is going to emancipate the whole universe. There’s no other way out.

153
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,892
It doesn’t mean your carnal love or your nonsensical ideas of love, it’s not, it’s pure love.

154
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,892
The pure love is that kind where the sap rises in a tree

155
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,892
and gives nourishment to all the parts of the tree and goes back. It’s not attached.

156
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,892
If it gets attached to one flower, the tree will die, the flower will die.

157
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,892
So this is the power which empowers you, nourishes you, soothes you,

158
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,892
consoles you, relaxes you and leaves you powerful.

159
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,892
That sort of a power is to be felt if it is the experience of truth.

160
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,892
But we have never tried to understand love in its own truth.

161
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,892
The reason is we were not realized people. When we are blind, we are mixed up.

162
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,892
We can’t make out one from another but when our eyes are opened out

163
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,892
we understand the true love. And this is what people have exploited, many of them,

164
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,892
many so called gurus and these people who talk of God have exploited

165
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,892
this side of love by teaching dirty things to people, debasing them, using their weaknesses.

166
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,892
Saying that if you do this kind of a weakness, then you will reach God.

167
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:02,892
Love that makes you a slave cannot be love and that is what it is, the love that is divine,

168
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,892
is the love of God that starts flowing through you, you become the medium, as you call it,

169
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,892
of that love. A powerful medium. But you know how to manoeuvre it.

170
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,892
You know everything. It’s not blindly, I have seen some people, oh we are in love, you see going on like that, no.

171
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,892
You know everyone. You know ins and outs of everyone and of yourself also.

172
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,892
I have seen many people coming to Me and saying, “Mother please save me from this Agnya.”

173
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,892
Now in our language it is this Agnya, but actually it means ego.

174
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,892
You can see your ego clearly once you get realization and we say oh God what is this?

175
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,892
That’s not me, I am not ego, oh that’s not me, I am the Self, I am the Spirit.

176
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,892
So this separation takes place within yourself, with your own understanding that,

177
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,892
you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this superego but you are the spirit.

178
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,892
And the more you grow into it, a beautiful personality of a character, which is not a character,

179
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,892
sometimes people think if you are very meek, is he compromising,

180
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,892
such a character will never compromise, is a terrific character.

181
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,892
It would never compromise with anything that is not the truth. It cannot by temperament.

182
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,892
But is very kind and compassionate, forgiving.

183
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,892
Gives lots of chances because there’s that inner urge to save others, to save others,

184
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,892
to help others, to get them to the right thing.

185
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,892
It’s like people who are standing on the brink of a disaster,

186
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,892
or people who are on the bank and see the people getting drowned and trying to pull them out

187
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,892
with all their effort. But they don’t want to compromise as to jump or to leave the banks that they have got.

188
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,892
Such a character you develop then and this character is felt by everyone.

189
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,892
I have known many Sahaja Yogis first who came to Sahaja Yoga,

190
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,892
their own family people were angry. Now you are following another Guru,

191
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,892
this is another cult, this is that. But then they found out that they are giving no money, nothing,

192
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,892
and they are flowering. In every way they are beautiful, they are becoming better and better people.

193
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,892
Righteous and virtuous people, powerful people of great character

194
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,892
and they are amazed you know. How do they become?

195
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,892
And they become very intelligent, they don’t do any stupid things, they just don’t do it.

196
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,892
Even a little child knows it’s stupid. They don’t do stupid things.

197
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,892
They don’t do nonsensical things. They are dignified and they don’t take to cheap entertainments.

198
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,892
The depth that you feel in the poets, in the great musicians, becomes their own nature.

199
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:02,892
When they talk, when they walk, any rapport with them, you can feel the depth of their spirit.

200
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,892
They become very knowledgeable suddenly. As I told you last time these journalists asked Me

201
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,892
“Mother have you got all scholars?” I said “Scholars, what.”

202
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,892
“All scholars are Sahaja Yogis,” I said “No, at the most one percent may be,

203
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,892
who have been great headaches to me, the rest of them are simple people.”

204
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,892
Simple people are the best and this is what is true,

205
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:42,892
that those who get realization start feeling the knowledge which is absolute.

206
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,892
Seeing the knowledge, knowing the knowledge.

207
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,892
Like if you see, say, this pillar, you just look at it, you say, oh very nicely done painted this,

208
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,892
somebody might say it should not have been this color, that color.

209
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,892
But a Sahaja Yogi doesn’t see this pillar as to how aesthetically it is and all that,

210
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,892
but immediately he’ll say it’s beautiful. You’ll say why? It gives vibrations.

211
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,892
The whole aesthetics are worked out through vibrations.

212
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,892
All the beautiful things, as I told you last time, of the world have vibrations.

213
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,892
Real beautiful things have vibrations. Like Mona Lisa I told you the other day,

214
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,892
if you go and feel her vibrations, she has vibrations.

215
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:50,892
Now the one who has made her has put his joy into her and she emits vibrations.

216
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:02,892
And that is the thing that gives joy to you because you are at a level where you can feel those vibrations.

217
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,892
You start feeling the physical side of yours, you understand you have a physical problem.

218
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,892
Immediately you know you have a physical problem, you know where it is,

219
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,892
how to correct it, how to cure it. I have seen many people who come to me,

220
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,892
Mother cure my cancer, but they don’t come to Me before they get cancer.

221
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,892
If they had come they would never have got it, but they had no time, at that time they had no time.

222
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,892
But when they get cancer I have no time either. It happens always.

223
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:51,892
Of course they are to be helped, cured, but why not come as a prevention to all those diseases

224
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:10,892
which has no meaning. It is unnecessarily so much accepted that health is first of all.

225
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,892
Then there is nothing to worry about health if you come to Sahaja Yoga,

226
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,892
you don’t need any doctor, sorry for the doctors, I am sorry.

227
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,892


228
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,892
And this is what it is to be understood that physically you feel absolutely fit.

229
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,892
You look fit absolutely. You look marvellous.

230
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:56,892
Then when you start expanding yourself you start feeling your own mind.

231
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,892
The peace, the bliss of your own mind.

232
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,892
Many a times you’ll find there is no thought but the joy is just bursting in

233
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,892
and you just think why it has happened. Suddenly, how do I get this?

234
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:28,892
Gradually the state of joy starts increasing in its frequency and you become joy.

235
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,892
That is, one has to achieve, to become the joy is important.

236
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,892
And once you become that joy it’s not a duality, it’s not a duality.

237
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,892
It’s not a thing in which you feel the happiness and unhappiness but you feel the joy.

238
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,892
Joy is a witness, it’s a kind of a power of a witness which sees a drama,

239
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,892
by seeing the drama, whether tragedy or comedy, it’s at a point where it is just a witness and enjoying it.

240
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,892
In the same way you’ll see so called comedies and tragedies of your life

241
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,892
and the futility of your nonsensical endeavours and you’ll laugh at it, oh that’s it, that’s me.

242
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,892
For example in Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare has tried to show the futility of all those egos.

243
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,892
According to Indian standards he was Avadhotta, as they call it, a person who was realised

244
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,892
and was a very evolved personality. And if you want to see how Romeo should get his realization

245
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,892
and how he should feel that after all that happened he should laugh loudly.

246
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,892
She gets realisation, oh what a fool a stupid thing I was.

247
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,892
Shakespeare did not show him getting realization he kept it for us Sahaja Yogis to see it,

248
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,892
but should have seen to it that Romeo laughs at himself and makes fun of himself,

249
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,892
oh stupid Mr. Romeo, now you better settle down.

250
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,892
But he showed and very cleverly if you see in all his Macbeth or any of his dramas

251
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,892
that he has tried to show the futility of our ego, our enterprises,

252
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,892
we think that is very important in life.

253
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,892
I would say there are so many great writers in English language,

254
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,892
which I cannot name them in a series, but I have read them.

255
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,892
Somerset Maugham, I would say was another one. I was very much impressed by his writings

256
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,892
and read most of his novels because he was very much there.

257
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,892
Cronin for example is another one I would say who wrote Citadel was another great person who

258
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,892
could see the drama of stupidity. Leave alone your great poets like William Blake and all those.

259
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,892
But all that was to show that there is a higher being you see, which sees all this,

260
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,892
and giving you a drama of yourself, projecting it through you.

261
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,892
That this is what you are, you see, see yourself.

262
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:48,892
That’s what they did and despite everything we’re lost. We are lost quite a lot.

263
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,892
We have to become the same like Shakespeare to see the drama,

264
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,892
like Somerset Maugham, we have to become the same.

265
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,892
To see the drama, we may not write a book, doesn’t matter,

266
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,892
but the capacity to see the drama, that’s what we develop.

267
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,892
We need not write, we may not have the flare of a pen to write but we see it the same way as they see it

268
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,892
and that’s the mental capacity to which we rise with self-realization.

269
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,892
I have seen very stupid people absolutely calling themselves gurus,

270
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,892
you look at them and you don’t know what to say, you see.

271
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,892
You have to look at stupider persons to stupider, that person, what you say, stupidest person,

272
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,892
in the presence of such a person, because he looks at you, you see,

273
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,892
and you understand he is stupid and you don’t know what to do.

274
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,892
And you get frightened of such a person you know and you don’t want to hurt his feelings you see,

275
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,892
so you look the greater stupid person and then he gives you a big lecture,

276
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,892
on something very stupid. But then you find that person you see,

277
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,892
big newspapers you see like Times, publishing such a stupid man there.

278
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,892
Just imagine, this is what we have done to Shakespeare, to all our great writers and everyone,

279
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,892
we have reached that state that we cannot even see the stupidity.

280
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,892


281
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,892
Our brain is stunned because we have been asking for sensations,

282
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,892
with all these electrical sensations in the brain we are stunned.

283
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:01,892
Which opens out, which completely opens out and you start seeing, through and through,

284
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,892
the mockery of all this kind of seriousness and the hypocrisy

285
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,892
and the way people who are stupid try to give you stupid ideas.

286
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,892
And once you are realised you laugh at yourself,

287
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,892
oh God I was so stupid, that’s what should happen.

288
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:39,892
If that does not happen your self-realization has no meaning, it has no meaning.

289
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,892
The righteousness and the virtues become part and parcel of your being.

290
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,892
It’s not that you have to be told anything, you just shouldn’t do it.

291
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,892
It’s beyond your self respect because you respect your Self, you respect your Spirit.

292
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,892
How can you do such a thing? You cannot despise yourself can you?

293
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,892
You just become virtuous. You may be kind to others even if they are not virtuous,

294
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,892
you can be nice to them, you can forgive them but as far as you are concerned there is no compromise.

295
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,892
And you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your magnanimity, you enjoy your generosity.

296
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,892
People will tell you, stupid fool, you go on distributing things what are you doing?

297
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:40,892
And you laugh at them. As Lao Tse said, somebody told Me this saying about Lao Tse,

298
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,892
another great incarnation of the primordial master,

299
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,892
that when a wise sees the way, he respects it and says this is the way.

300
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,892
That’s the sign of a wise man and a mediocre who is half way this way and that way

301
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,892
when he sees the way he waits for others to go into it,

302
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,892
and when the stupid sees the way he laughs.

303
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,892
But when the wise sees the stupid in himself he laughs.

304
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:41,892
So that power of wisdom starts shinning through you, you become a wise, righteous, virtuous man.

305
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,892
And such a balance you develop. I have known people who are honest, you see, so called,

306
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,892
now they go to such an extreme of honesty, that for honesty’s sake they’ll kill their father,

307
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,892
kill their mother, kill everyone.

308
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,892
But such a balanced and integrated person you become

309
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,892
that whatever you do is good for your spirit and for the spirit of others.

310
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,892
In Sanskrit the word is Haitha [BEST GUESS],

311
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,892
what ever is good for your spirit and for the spirit of others you do it.

312
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,892
And that is the right thing to do, and that’s how you become a righteous personality.

313
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,892
That’s the religion within you that gets awakened. Nobody has to tell you your religion,

314
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,892
you yourself become your own master, your own Guru, and by which you determine yourself,

315
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:58,892
now Mr. you can’t do this. No you can’t. So you become your own police commissioner.

316
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,892
You don’t need any outsider to tell you.

317
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,892
You are on your own guard because if you do something like that your vibrations will disappear

318
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,892
and then you don’t like it, don’t like it. Then you feel uneasy.

319
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,892
Nobody has to have you as a Guru, there’s no need you become your own Guru, is the best way.

320
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:37,892
And that’s how you solve the problem of becoming better by others,

321
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:49,892
is very difficult but yourself becoming better, by your own understanding and urges,

322
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:59,892
it’s a thousand fold happier and strong.

323
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:12,892
So the third thing that happens to you, that you become religious, you become the Guru, yourself.

324
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,892
Nobody has to tell you because there is a natural valency of ten within you

325
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,892
which starts balancing you, and you become one and enjoy that balance.

326
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,892
As you enjoy a balance of colors in a beautiful photograph,

327
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,892
in the same way you enjoy the balance within yourself. You enjoy your personality,

328
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,892
you enjoy your being and you enjoy to be the Self.

329
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,892
And those who are on the same level, you just enjoy each other.

330
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,892
This is the first time you enjoy other human being, as if you are enjoying a flower.

331
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:05,892
The fragrance of that personality is spiritual fragrance, is so beautiful and attractive.

332
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:17,892
Without any lust and greed in it but just enjoying the company is real perfect bliss.

333
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,892
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

334
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:22,000
END
