00:10.915 --> 00:20.230
I’m sorry what has happened yesterday, but I think the war has begun between the evil and good

00:20.230 --> 00:25.780
and after all the good prevails.

00:25.780 --> 00:39.512
In these modern times, evil used to prevail on good but now in this Krita Yuga,

00:39.512 --> 00:51.543
the evil will be completely conquered by good, and not only that, but good will spread all over.

01:02.890 --> 01:18.121
The evil has the capacity to go to extremes and then to fall out of the evolutionary process completely.

01:19.696 --> 01:31.745
Because they are blind they cannot see the good that’s why they are evil.

01:33.803 --> 01:41.357
If they could see the good they would give up their evil.

01:41.357 --> 01:50.134
In our country which is a country of yoga, especially Maharastra which is the country of the saints,

01:50.134 --> 01:56.300
I was amazed to hear what people are up to.

01:56.310 --> 02:05.041
One of the real source of this nonsense seems to be Rajneesh, the horrible fellow, because

02:05.051 --> 02:13.600
he has made an exhibition here absolutely denouncing all the deities and saying all

02:13.610 --> 02:20.240
kinds of dirty things, and I think the chief
minister of this place is also hand in glove

02:20.250 --> 02:28.031
with him and they are all trying to prove that there is no God, there is no spirituality.

02:28.041 --> 02:38.070
They want to establish that science is everything.

02:38.080 --> 02:46.761
We have no heritage of science in India, we have the heritage of spirituality.

02:46.771 --> 02:55.971
I mean nobody is known as such a great scientist
in this country.

02:55.981 --> 03:05.641
Nobody has made any special inventions and the way people are organising it in the name

03:05.651 --> 03:11.451
of science, there is hardly anyone who has done anything of science.

03:11.461 --> 03:18.750
So it’s the evil which has taken this new form of talking about science and denouncing God

03:18.750 --> 03:24.807
Of course in the West also the same thing has happened to a great extent but not to that extent.

03:24.807 --> 03:30.295
They have not discarded everything that was spiritual.

03:30.624 --> 03:37.062
But here they have gone headlong, those few people who are there, very, very few, but they are there.

03:37.062 --> 03:45.202
So it’s a very bad growth in this country, it won’t survive I know, it cannot survive

03:45.202 --> 03:48.940
because this country is so full of spirituality.

03:48.940 --> 03:56.473
In the West, because people took to science, they have lost all culture of society.

03:56.473 --> 04:00.450
There is no culture of society.

04:00.450 --> 04:06.950
The etiquettes are limited to fork and spoon or how you wish each other.

04:06.950 --> 04:08.832
There is no other culture.

04:08.832 --> 04:12.672
It’s so outside, there is nothing deep really.

04:12.672 --> 04:20.284
Because they have taken absolutely to the modern, or we can say that

04:20.284 --> 04:34.985
it's the industrial evolution of the people, they have taken to all that and have lost contact with reality.

04:35.532 --> 04:45.044
The culture of any country can only survive on spirituality.

04:45.044 --> 04:58.691
Science cannot talk of this and it has so many limitations that it cannot even answer simple few questions that are facing them.

04:58.691 --> 05:13.754
Above all they have no idea what is love, they have no idea what is the all pervading Power.

05:13.754 --> 05:20.335
Now you all have felt it, and you know what it is, and you know how to use it.

05:20.335 --> 05:23.483
So, under these circumstances I find

05:23.483 --> 05:34.941
that those people who are mediocres in Sahaja Yoga cannot help much  for establishing goodness.

05:34.941 --> 05:40.701
You have to be very clean within yourself, you have to be very powerful within yourself

05:40.701 --> 05:44.036
and you have to be extremely sensitive.

05:44.036 --> 05:51.676
So, we are not to waste our energy, our attention onto superficial and nonsensical things.

05:51.676 --> 05:57.488
We have to get out of it and we have to become
people who are detached,

05:57.488 --> 06:00.487
detached from any things which create problems.

06:00.487 --> 06:11.005
If you take a detached view of everything you will have a kind of

06:11.005 --> 06:21.145
a life that will nourish your society which is now sick, is a sick society, is a decadent society.

06:21.145 --> 06:27.529
And for that decadent society you need people who are very morally strong,

06:27.529 --> 06:34.253
who are tremendously pure and who know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

06:34.881 --> 06:40.763
The mediocrity in Sahaja Yoga is very common in the West, very common.

06:40.763 --> 06:45.661
And so much involved into their personal problems that

06:45.661 --> 06:55.935
I cannot understand how will they rise above this nonsensical, personal viewpoint of view.

06:56.320 --> 07:02.230
So, one has to realise that the whole tree that has grown outside so much

07:02.230 --> 07:08.807
due to industrial revolution has to seek its own nourishment

07:08.807 --> 07:13.133
from spirituality which is in India. No doubt.

07:13.545 --> 07:19.982
Spirituality without development has no meaning.

07:20.301 --> 07:25.919
Spirituality has to have development outside otherwise it is lost in the Mother Earth.

07:25.919 --> 07:31.835
It has to sprout and it has to show results, which we are showing no doubt.

07:31.835 --> 07:36.121
In so many ways Indian Sahaja Yogis are trying to show that,

07:36.121 --> 07:39.496
though they are rather slow about that point.

07:39.496 --> 07:44.752
So, it’s something funny that in the West people are rather slow,

07:44.752 --> 07:49.651
Sahaja Yogis are rather slow about their spirituality,

07:49.651 --> 07:58.149
and in India people are rather slow about their manifestation outside.

08:01.274 --> 08:05.411
Unless and until we really do some dedicated effort

08:05.411 --> 08:09.039
it’s not going to work out.

08:09.039 --> 08:15.885
So I hope as we have circulated letters that we have come here

08:15.885 --> 08:24.481
not for fun but for dedication and for our ascent and it’s a pilgrimage.

08:25.754 --> 08:34.553
Talking loose, talking about small things, quarrelling with each other

08:34.553 --> 08:40.909
is out of question of course. But domination, terrible domination

08:40.909 --> 08:45.799
of falsehood, just to think that you are leaders,

08:45.799 --> 08:53.039
or, "Why is he leader?" you know, shows that we are not yet worthy.

08:53.039 --> 09:00.499
So, the worthiness of a ship is very important if it has to fight the turbulence of the sea.

09:00.499 --> 09:07.363
If it cannot fight the turbulence of the sea then it is definitely not seaworthy

09:07.363 --> 09:12.540
and it is absolutely useless because it cannot go across.

09:12.540 --> 09:15.444
In the same way, if you have to be something,

09:15.444 --> 09:19.717
you have to work it out in such a manner that you really become worthy

09:19.717 --> 09:26.357
of crossing this ocean of illusion and that many could cross with you.

09:28.060 --> 09:34.594
As in India they have started at every place,
at every home, at every family, a center.

09:35.362 --> 09:38.661
If they invite people, they talk about nothing
but Sahaja Yoga.

09:38.661 --> 09:44.586
Now you can go all out to talk about it, I give you permission to tell them that I have come

09:44.586 --> 09:47.291
there’s nothing to hide.

09:47.301 --> 09:55.963
And you have to go and open the doors

09:55.963 --> 10:05.024
of many churches and many temples and many organisations and tell them that I am there.

10:05.024 --> 10:08.924
Now the time has come, you can see it so clearly, it’s so obvious.

10:09.365 --> 10:14.345
First, I used to say, "I would not go to the newspapers, this not good that’s not good,

10:14.345 --> 10:16.281
let us work it out."

10:16.281 --> 10:19.779
But it has come now so much, that I have to say things and I am going to say them,

10:19.779 --> 10:23.735
very openly, I am going to say them.

10:23.735 --> 10:26.752
But I want all of you to be such

10:26.752 --> 10:37.655
that nobody should point out a finger at you to say, "Oh, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

10:37.655 --> 10:41.786
And how this Sahaja Yogi is behaving."

10:41.786 --> 10:49.938
If somebody is stupid and not working it out, it's better to get rid of such a person.

10:49.938 --> 10:54.722
Or else help that person and tell him that, "You have to come up.

10:54.722 --> 10:58.384
You can’t be here, we don’t want mediocre people here.

10:58.384 --> 11:05.212
We want some very extraordinarily, pure people.“

11:05.212 --> 11:08.250
The purity is the main point which we have to have.

11:08.250 --> 11:11.851
Once you are pure you don’t have to worry, then I look after you.

11:11.851 --> 11:19.827
But the purity of mind, purity of heart and the purity of your attention, these three things are very important.

11:20.107 --> 11:25.581
When it works out, you’ll be surprised collectivity will grow in no time.

11:25.581 --> 11:32.477
Is a tendency among Sahaja Yogis also, still, to go back to the same materialism

11:32.477 --> 11:38.622
and to try to have your own house, your family, your
children- sort of a nonsense.

11:38.622 --> 11:43.330
We have to be in the ashrams and we have to work it out,

11:43.330 --> 11:48.042
we have to work it out very beautifully that we all live very happily in the ashram.

11:48.121 --> 11:55.051
But I find still people cannot work it out that way.

11:56.191 --> 11:59.904
They are more concerned about their jobs, concerned about their things.

11:59.904 --> 12:03.704
Once you live in the ashram I’ll see that you get everything.

12:03.938 --> 12:12.348
But if you do not want to have the blessings
of God, how can anybody help you?

12:12.348 --> 12:14.938
So, tremendous sacrifice is needed.

12:14.938 --> 12:18.684
Of course, as you know in Sahaja Yoga I don’t need any money from you at all,

12:18.826 --> 12:26.219
but sacrifice is very important, and sacrifice of nonsensical ideas that you have.

12:26.958 --> 12:30.300
In every way we have to show that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

12:30.300 --> 12:34.119
The way you dress up, the way you live, the way you think, the way you behave,

12:34.119 --> 12:36.375
the way you have relationships with each other

12:36.375 --> 12:39.053
and the way you lead your married life

12:39.053 --> 12:44.025
and the way you look at your children.

12:45.830 --> 12:51.392
Unless and until you have purity the light of love will not shine,

12:51.392 --> 12:54.572
the light of love will not shine.

12:54.572 --> 12:59.931
You have to absorb the light of love within yourself.

13:00.121 --> 13:04.052
But you cannot unless and until you are a pure personality.

13:04.052 --> 13:11.889
And that pure personality has to develop by your meditation, by working hard, it’s a question of few years.

13:11.889 --> 13:15.729
In ten years we can change the whole world,
in ten years!

13:15.729 --> 13:18.441
But you have to be really very dedicated.

13:24.334 --> 13:28.995
It is you who has to change, not Me.

13:28.995 --> 13:32.875
You have to work it out, not Me.

13:33.437 --> 13:39.127
I have done my level best but within ten years it should be possible that every Sahaja Yogi

13:39.127 --> 13:42.706
should become a tremendous force of Sahaja Yoga.

13:42.706 --> 13:46.216
So, please try to avoid all those who are mediocres.

13:46.216 --> 13:52.368
If you find mediocrity, the leaders must go all out to correct them,

13:52.368 --> 13:55.132
all out to tell them off. Don’t tolerate.

13:55.132 --> 13:59.611
You don’t have to be very mild on this point.

13:59.611 --> 14:06.342
You have to tell them frankly that, "See now, you are an extremely mediocre person for Sahaja Yoga.

14:06.342 --> 14:09.626
It's not meant for mediocres.

14:09.626 --> 14:13.655
It's not meant for foolish people, it's not meant for stupid people,

14:13.655 --> 14:21.115
it’s meant for something who are ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of truth.“

14:21.294 --> 14:25.664
These people are saying that, "Why don’t you go the way of science?"

14:25.664 --> 14:30.372
I say, "Why don’t you go the way of truth?"

14:30.372 --> 14:32.572
Take to truth.

14:32.572 --> 14:37.294
Science is not truth. Today it might appear, tomorrow it disappears.

14:37.891 --> 14:41.793
Today you may think it is correct but every hypothesis is challenged,

14:41.793 --> 14:46.557
every law is challenged, that’s no law.

14:46.950 --> 14:50.673
You have to use Sahaja Yoga in every practical life, everywhere.

14:50.673 --> 14:53.293
But in no way you have to be fanatic about it.

14:53.415 --> 14:58.617
Like I have seen some people start giving vibrations

14:58.617 --> 15:04.791
or they start moving their hands for bandhans,

15:04.791 --> 15:07.600
even if I am sitting, they are doing like that.

15:07.600 --> 15:15.400
There is no stupidity about it, it has to be very dignified, decent and decorous.

15:17.150 --> 15:22.676
But for that we need really people of quality.

15:22.676 --> 15:27.143
And a complete obedience is needed I must say.

15:27.704 --> 15:33.727
I have told Indian people that time that they must have a proper case done for them.

15:33.727 --> 15:36.927
They just didn’t listen to Me that time, they said, "Mother, why do you want,

15:36.927 --> 15:39.335
you know, you'll be in trouble and all that".

15:39.518 --> 15:44.098
If they had listened to Me there would have been no trouble today.

15:45.483 --> 15:50.427
But you must listen to Me what I say, don’t give Me explanations, don’t give Me logic,

15:50.427 --> 15:53.207
but I know everything you know that.

15:53.207 --> 15:57.640
I know everything.

15:57.857 --> 16:02.057
Now we have something good for you is the list of the marriages.

16:02.057 --> 16:06.717
But marriage is not such an important thing that you think about.

16:07.831 --> 16:13.181
It’s not such an important thing for you that you dedicate all your attention to that.

16:13.181 --> 16:17.325
It’s just by the way, because you have to have a marriage, that’s why.

16:17.325 --> 16:20.185
There’s no need even to have sometimes.

16:20.700 --> 16:28.437
But you have to have it, and then letters after letters about your marriages, about your children, I just don’t want to read that.

16:28.716 --> 16:32.624
Nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

16:33.952 --> 16:38.922
If you are detached, whatever may be the quality of your wife, you will not fall,

16:38.922 --> 16:41.815
whatever may be the quality of your husband, you will not fall.

16:41.994 --> 16:51.231
So one has to be little concerned that: what are we doing?

16:51.231 --> 16:53.752
What have we achieved?

16:54.121 --> 16:59.880
What are we going to give to the world?

17:04.177 --> 17:10.141
For Me, you are my instruments. I don’t have to ask anybody else.

17:10.141 --> 17:13.733
You are my instruments and you have to work it out.

17:13.733 --> 17:19.224
You are not for Me useless people, I worked very hard with you, very hard.

17:19.375 --> 17:22.756
So please don’t waste my energies also

17:22.756 --> 17:29.275
and try to become very good Sahaja Yogis in every way that is possible,

17:29.275 --> 17:35.640
in every way you should be dedicated, in every way try to be something

17:35.640 --> 17:37.610
of very great qualities.

17:37.610 --> 17:42.171
Now you have seen how people have becoming violent and there is a violence on.

17:42.171 --> 17:47.610
Of course, this may not continue but it’s one of the signs that we have to be prepared

17:47.610 --> 17:53.543
to be very strong people, very strong,

17:53.543 --> 17:55.313
and that will work out I’m sure.

17:55.313 --> 18:01.211
They threw about 400 stones at least, maybe more according to the police report

18:01.211 --> 18:03.818
and very few people were hurt.

18:04.221 --> 18:06.121
What does that mean?

18:06.121 --> 18:11.290
That there is somebody who is avoiding all these troubles.

18:15.282 --> 18:20.060
Regarding our tour further, now I have decided we will not go to Atith

18:20.060 --> 18:24.683
because there are- the commissioner, the ESP told Me that it is better not to go,

18:24.683 --> 18:28.099
it's very- these people are very bad and they are criminals.

18:28.099 --> 18:31.989
So, now until the election comes in, they will be behaving like this manner.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.424
After the election of course they will be put down.

18:35.424 --> 18:41.930
So you should go by the understanding of the time and

18:41.930 --> 18:46.860
directly to Sangli, so we’ll go to Sangli, we will have a puja there, you can do shopping whatever you like

18:46.860 --> 18:53.060
and then from there will be going to Ganapatipule.

18:53.060 --> 18:57.446
But it’s not fun, it’s not fun.

18:57.446 --> 19:01.721
It is our development.

19:01.721 --> 19:06.836
Otherwise you will be coming to India, going back the same, empty handed.

19:07.341 --> 19:13.159
I want you, everyone, to be extremely active in your own sphere of life,

19:13.159 --> 19:14.149
talk about Sahaja Yoga.

19:14.149 --> 19:19.658
You must wear my badges, you must wear my rings, you must wear my necklaces

19:19.658 --> 19:26.030
so that people ask you “Who is this?” Then you should say, “She is the Holy Ghost”.

19:26.030 --> 19:29.385
You can say, "We think she is the Holy Ghost".

19:29.385 --> 19:31.691
Let us see what happens.

19:35.291 --> 19:39.808
So, it’s a serious thing that I felt that I have to talk to you

19:39.808 --> 19:46.211
and that we have to be very, very careful about how we look at ourselves.

19:46.211 --> 19:50.510
We have to be aware, we have to be aware about ourselves and what is happening.

19:50.510 --> 19:54.354
I’ve been telling you this many a times, we have to be aware as to what we are

19:54.354 --> 19:55.489
and what is happening.

19:55.489 --> 20:01.908
But if your jobs are important, everything else is important how are you going to work out Sahaja Yoga?

20:03.954 --> 20:07.923
So, there has to be awareness and with your awareness the light will spread.

20:07.923 --> 20:11.293
But it’s not silent, you have to talk about it.

20:13.352 --> 20:19.067
Eloquence is needed, it has to be eloquent, all your light has to talk,

20:19.067 --> 20:25.537
the light has to say, the light has to express and has to
be very confidently done.

20:26.081 --> 20:33.466
Let us see now after going from this tour how far people establish new things.

20:33.756 --> 20:40.111
So far, what my own opinion is,  that there are 50% of Sahaja Yogis

20:40.111 --> 20:43.822
in the West are still quite mediocre

20:43.822 --> 20:47.945
and 25% of them are just there to take advantage.

20:47.945 --> 20:51.382
If they can get something free, they would like to do it.

20:51.721 --> 20:53.793
25% people are like that.

20:53.793 --> 20:57.175
It’s very sad but it is so.

20:57.175 --> 21:02.448
But I must say Indians are poor people but
they will not do anything,

21:02.448 --> 21:06.201
they will never take anything free from Me, nothing.

21:06.211 --> 21:09.076
They will not, they are very self-respecting.

21:09.076 --> 21:11.507
And that is what we have to develop, that self-respect.

21:12.331 --> 21:17.042
Like I have seen I had a house in Hounslow, everybody went there and stayed there free.

21:17.042 --> 21:20.615
Now we have a house there in Shuddy Camp where
everybody goes,

21:20.615 --> 21:24.610
who has no job goes and stays there. It’s such a nonsensical thing.

21:24.610 --> 21:29.757
So, I’m even afraid to start any ashram in London because same thing will start.

21:29.757 --> 21:32.913
If they can take advantage they would like to be there.

21:32.913 --> 21:35.624
Even a spoon they would like to carry like that.

21:35.859 --> 21:39.378
It’s a shameless thing for a Sahaja Yogi to behave like that I think.

21:39.528 --> 21:48.338
We have to have full self-respect and we must understand that we have to sacrifice, to do something about it.

21:50.593 --> 21:54.476
Because this is the last leg, I would say, when I will be talking to you about all these things

21:54.476 --> 22:03.447
and in the beautiful atmosphere here on the bank of Krishna river.

22:04.214 --> 22:10.866
We have to understand that the river flows, it makes a sound,

22:10.866 --> 22:14.971
it makes a sound to show that she- it exists.

22:15.889 --> 22:23.209
But we are not only rivers, we are all the mountains, rivers, everything of the universe we are.

22:23.500 --> 22:31.581
And our manifestation is like a big zero as if the Mother Earth has been emptied out.

22:32.591 --> 22:39.754
It is time that we should watch ourselves and see ourselves, what’s wrong with us.

22:39.754 --> 22:41.157
Very important.

22:41.157 --> 22:47.365
I had to say this once again and again,

22:47.365 --> 22:51.203
but I don’t like to say these things because I love you so much

22:51.203 --> 22:55.084
and I care for you so much and you people also love Me.

22:55.084 --> 22:59.184
But loving Me is not sufficient, you have to love yourself and respect yourself.

22:59.466 --> 23:01.865
Only your Self is going to work out.

23:02.100 --> 23:05.699
As Shivaji Maharaj said, "Swa-dharma rajya"

23:05.699 --> 23:10.954
"You must develop the religion of your Spirit".

23:11.245 --> 23:16.147
That’s what we have to do, is to develop the religion of our Spirit.

23:16.147 --> 23:25.522
And once it happens, we can get the whole world completely emancipated.

23:25.522 --> 23:32.224
This is our work and if we fail then it is the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and nobody else

23:32.224 --> 23:39.154
So, for everyone I have to tell you that I don’t have to please you, you have to please me.

23:42.121 --> 23:48.121
For a small thing people react, for a small thing they feel bad.

23:48.121 --> 23:51.930
If I don’t smile at somebody they feel bad.

23:51.930 --> 23:55.617
In little, little things they feel bad and they react.

23:55.617 --> 23:58.093
If I say anything, they react.

23:58.093 --> 24:00.323
So how can anything go into you?

24:00.446 --> 24:04.666
If it is such a convexity, how will you absorb it?

24:04.666 --> 24:11.194
It is important that we should try to absorb
with humility, with understanding.

24:11.194 --> 24:14.508
Now you are Sahaja Yogis, you know I am Adi Shakti,

24:14.508 --> 24:17.433
you have had photographs, you have known that I am Adi Shakti.

24:17.433 --> 24:19.581
But how much are we absorbing?

24:19.581 --> 24:21.579
How much we are taking within ourselves?

24:21.579 --> 24:26.331
This work is much more than any one of the incarnations had to do.

24:26.331 --> 24:31.198
It's much more than Christ, is much more than Rama, much more than Shri Krishna’s.

24:31.629 --> 24:35.614
So create such great people among you.

24:35.614 --> 24:41.638
Because I have the power, only thing, you have to have the absorption power,

24:41.638 --> 24:43.314
the acceptability.

24:43.314 --> 24:49.145
But if you run after something very cheapish and something very frivolous, it’s impossible.

24:49.968 --> 24:58.675
You have to ask for your depth and you have to take in, whatever is emitting from my being.

24:58.675 --> 25:02.110
I hope now you all will take it up seriously.

25:02.110 --> 25:05.400
Do your meditation every morning whatever maybe the time.

25:05.400 --> 25:11.961
Every morning we have to do the meditation and we have to see that we finish our work in the night

25:11.961 --> 25:15.309
and then we do little meditation and then sleep off.

25:15.309 --> 25:22.062
Without meditation you cannot grow and that’s why everything doing you have to know that you have to get up in the morning,

25:22.062 --> 25:26.022
do your meditation and then you can take to your work.

25:26.022 --> 25:28.741
Daytime if you want, you can rest for a while.

25:28.741 --> 25:32.849
Now we are in such a place that we have time to rest for a while,

25:32.849 --> 25:35.976
but morning time you have to get up whatever time you sleep.

25:35.976 --> 25:40.343
You have to conquer your sleep a little bit, it gives you lot of lethargy.

25:40.343 --> 25:45.293
Last night I don’t think I slept before 3 o’clock or something like that

25:45.293 --> 25:49.272
and then the whole day I’ve been busy writing reports, this, that.

25:49.445 --> 25:55.025
If I can manage at this age, at your age you should be able to manage something like that.

25:55.176 --> 26:00.227
We have no time to sleep, we have no time to discuss, argue or to eat our food.

26:00.489 --> 26:05.363
We have only time to meditate, that’s all.

26:05.879 --> 26:12.399
I wish all of you absorb my saying and understand it without reacting to it.

26:12.399 --> 26:13.782
Please do not react.

26:13.782 --> 26:16.610
Don’t think, "Mother is trying to chastise you". No.

26:16.610 --> 26:21.871
I’m trying to help you to grow, this is the way you grow sometimes very fast.

26:21.871 --> 26:25.555
So it’s just your growth I am worried about and nothing else.

26:25.555 --> 26:26.974
May God bless you all.

26:26.974 --> 26:32.073
I was very happy the way you were singing all the songs and the way you expressed yourselves.
