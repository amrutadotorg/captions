00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:28.160
(Shri Mataji asks the audience in Hindi
to ask Her questions.)

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.440
(A seeker asks a question.)

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.880
SHRI MATAJI: How one gets it, isn’t it?

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.080
All right, sit down.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.160
That’s what I’ve been saying —
that it just works out.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.480
It is a spontaneous happening.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.480
Now, we’ll see one thing,

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.520
that how does a little seed
gets into a tree?

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.240
It’s a living process.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.440
You’ll just say it just works out.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.200
It is already there,
that’s why it is sahaja.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.280
“Saha” means “with”, “ja” means “born”.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.880
It is absolutely spontaneous.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.960
I am an enlightened person, is a fact.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.080
And when I touch you,
you get enlightenment yourself.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.640
It’s a very, very simple thing.
All right?

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.360
Another question?

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.120
This was a nice one,
because we always say of “how”.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.360
SEEKER: Enlightenment through
other methods,

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:25.600
with siddhis [supernatural powers].
SHRI MATAJI: Huh?

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.640
SEEKER: With siddhis,
that’s what they are called.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.920
SHRI MATAJI: No, no, is wrong.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.120
That is always been banned.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.880
You see, in the olden days also
we had people who were misled.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.680
That is the history.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.680
There are some people…
now, for example, if we had Hitler,

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.880
that doesn’t mean he’s a praman
[right measure, authority].

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.800
If we had somebody like…
a satanic force like Ravan,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.720
doesn’t mean that he was praman.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.920
For us, pramani is whatever achieved
the maximum.

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.920
So the praman always remains the best.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.640
You see, all such people
who say that it gives siddhis

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.360
are the people who are Tantrikas
[followers of the Tantra doctrine].

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.080
And they were all thrown out.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:10.520
These are all known as kshudrata
[insignificance, meanness].

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.480
But some of the people
who have written books on these things

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.680
are not themselves realized,
have read this book, that book,

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.320
and then they have said
that their siddhis are also there.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.360
Siddhis are nothing but you move on
to your supraconscious side.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.280
And when you move on
to a supraconscious side,
a spirit comes into you.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.440
And then what happens — you start
producing something from your hand…

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.480
We had one lady in our Sahaja Yoga,
she came to us,

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.240
and, you know, when I went to America,

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.920
she started showing
all kinds of chamatkaras [wonders].

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.480
She started telling people

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.600
that “Where is your money’s lost,
you can find there,” like that.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.280
And she became very popular,
and she used to get one thousand people

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.560
everyday coming to her.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.520
And ultimately she started telling them
even the number of the [UNCLEAR].

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.880
So the supraconscious things
can be like that.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.080
ESP, you become
an extrasensory perceptive man,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.360
and all that is nothing
but another spirit.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.440
But human beings sit tight.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.840
You’ll be surprised, from America
two great scientists came just to see Me.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.920
For what?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.560
They said, “You must teach us how to fly
in the air. We want to leave our body.”

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.800
I said, “Why? Are you not flying
already on our heads?

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.200
Now what do you want to do?”

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.760
They said, “Now we want to leave
our bodies and fly in the air.”

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:23.280
So I said, “But if I tell you

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.880
that this is done through the spirits,
will you do it?” —

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.320
“Yes, still we want to do it.”

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.520
I said, “Why?”

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.680
They said, “Because Russians are doing
the same, so we want to do.”

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.920
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Marathi.)

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.440
Then I said…
and they would not, you see.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.960
Then I asked them, “Who told you?”
So they said, “Patanjali.”

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.440
You know, Patanjali is a newspaper man.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.720
And Patanjali… I said,
“Look at this fellow, he came for treatment

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.680
because he used to get this kind of a…
experience that used to leave his body,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.760
and he came to Me for getting cured.”

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.320
And he is telling him, you go to Mataji
and She’ll make you that!

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.320
And these fools, you know,
they would not listen to Me!

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.600
So, the knowledge that we have…

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.280
we do not have a proper method
of discrimination.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.560
We don’t know what is
absolute knowledge. This is wrong.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.760
For that, you must have vibrations.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.160
With vibrations. Now you can ask,
all those who are realized,

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.320
you can ask: “Is there God or not?”
See the answer you’ll get.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.840
[UNCLEAR] means yes.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:42.000
All answers come,
and you can record it on your hands.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.560
Even to a small thing.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.440
You must hear Pharkay,
today he was telling Me about this,

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.200
that when he… some gentleman
was somewhere,

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.200
and he said
that “You just find his vibrations.”

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.680
So he put his hands there,

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.280
and he said, “Let me see the vibrations” —
and nothing was coming,

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:59.960
and nothing you could feel,
and nothing of the chakras.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.960
So he then said, “He cannot be there,
because I cannot feel anything.”

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.800
So, this man thought of him:
“Oh, yes, yes.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.440
He must be on the aeroplane,
he is not there.”

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.640
To such an extent it goes!

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.840
In London, there’s one gentleman,

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.120
he said, “Mataji, can I feel
somebody’s vibrations?”

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.560
I said, “You can.” —

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:17.960
“Can I feel my father’s?”

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.600
I said, “Yes. All right,
you put your hands and ask a question.”

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.760
Immediately his Vishuddhi Chakra
started burning.

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:24.040
He said, “Mother, this is burning.”

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.440
I said, “You telephone to him just now.
Ask how he is.”

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.000
So his mother said, “He cannot talk
to you, his throat is very bad.”

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.920
And the father was very far away.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:40.800
“He cannot talk to you,
his throat is very bad” —
Vishuddhi Chakra is catching.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.480
All the information you get
on your hand, on your vibrations.

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:51.600
And then, when you’ll see these books,
you’ll be surprised
they’ll be burning your hands.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:55.200
(Shri Mataji says a phrase in Hindi.)

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:03.960
You’ll be amazed that how you find out
who is a real guru and non-real guru.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.920
It’s so correct with this!

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.080
We have got here a case of one lady.

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.720
She told Me that somebody
came to see her,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.800
and, I mean, somebody
came to stay with her,

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.360
her own brother or someone very near.

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.200
And she started burning
all the time, this and that.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.560
So she said,
“Do you go to Satya Sai Baba?”

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:23.240
He said, “No.”

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.440
She said, “No, but how can that be?
I am getting terrible burning,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.560
as I get it from a disciple
of Satya Sai Baba.

00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:31.040
You must have been somewhere.
You must have been.”
He said, “I’ve never been there.”

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.120
So she said, “Really?”

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:34.240
And she was searching him out,
and nothing was there.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.280
So she opened his box, and in the box
there was a Satya Sai Baba’s photograph.

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.400
Our [UNCLEAR] is here, you can ask him.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.480
His wife… his daughter-in-law
was a big problem in London.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.600
And they didn’t know how to locate
why she was behaving like this

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.440
and she was giving them
burning like that.

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.400
They opened her purse one day,
and in the purse was that photograph.

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.520
The day they threw it away,
everything is all right.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.240
Otherwise it was going to be a divorce,

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.080
for nothing at all — the poor lady
was vomiting, doing all kinds of things.

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.280
There are so many cases like that.

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:10.560
I mean, the proof is there.

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:19.160
(Shri Mataji says a few phrases
in Marathi.)

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:21.040
He called us to some place

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.920
where there was a centre
of Satya Sai Baba.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.080
He said, “Mataji, You must save
those people.”

00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:28.920
When I sat there,
so many children just fainted.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.720
Then they told us that “These children
have been fainting like this.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.840
You have to do something about it.

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.000
And so many children are lost.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:40.880
They just go away.
God knows how they are lost.”

00:07:42.320 --> 00:07:45.360
I told him, “Baba, his centre,
let him look after now. I am fed up.”

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.360
What am I to do now?

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:52.000
I must first of all create some doctors,
some realized souls.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:56.120
When I have some more people
to work it out, we can work it out.

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.280
But one thing is there:
after getting Realization you must come,

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.440
and learn it, and master everything.

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.280
You become… I tell you,
each and everything of Kundalini,

00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:06.200
you can just master it.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.400
It’s very easy.

00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:11.200
It is so easy and it helps you.

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.960
You know this is the power of love;
you must know how it is worked out.

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:16.960
We know all the power of hatred only.

00:08:17.160 --> 00:08:19.840
Supposing somebody
is very unkind to you.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:22.080
I’ll tell you
about My husband’s secretary.

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.560
She got her Realization.
And she said, “I have got neighbours,

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.040
some three, four young boys,
and they are horrible hippies.

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.160
They are making noise,
and they are troublesome,
and they call me an old hen.

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.800
What have I to do
if they just make fun of me?”

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.560
I said, “All right, what will you do?”

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:39.040
She said, “I’m really fed up,
I’m going to give up the house.”

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.000
I said, “You just don’t do like that.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.360
You just go and put a bandhan
on their house,

00:08:43.560 --> 00:08:48.960
every day thrice, like this,
and just think of Me with love.”

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:53.080
Now she says that it is quiet
like a churchyard.

00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.400
“They are very quiet.

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.600
And they are very kind,
they open the lift for me.

00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.800
When I go, they help me.”

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:36.360
(A seeker asks a question in Hindi.
Shri Mataji answers first in Hindi
and then continues in English.)

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.560
You are the instrument.

00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.920
You are the instrument,
you are the medicine,

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.760
you are the curer,
you are the doctor,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:50.040
you are the computer,
you are everything.

00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.040
But you should become your Self.

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.000
You have to become your Self.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:12.240
(Shri Mataji continues to speak in Hindi.)
