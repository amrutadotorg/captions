00:00:00.198 --> 00:00:03.579
Birthday Puja March 21, 1998
Delhi, India

00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:13.178
I was overjoyed to see

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.177
this beautiful welcome.the way you had organized

00:00:24.707 --> 00:00:31.287
I must say that it’s your love which finds

00:00:31.394 --> 00:00:42.112
all kind of expressions of enjoying Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:52.332
I really can’t understand how these unique ideas

00:00:52.658 --> 00:01:00.681
come to your heads, and you represent

00:01:00.718 --> 00:01:06.421
the different countries from where you have come.

00:01:07.403 --> 00:01:15.519
I wish you carry these flags back to
your own countries,

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:20.705
and tell them the message that the time has come

00:01:20.998 --> 00:01:27.522
for our resurrection, that we have to rise.

00:01:27.983 --> 00:01:33.589
We have to rise above this human level

00:01:33.851 --> 00:01:37.414
to a higher level of existence.

00:01:37.581 --> 00:01:43.369
And if that happens, then how it changes your life,

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.070
how it makes you happy,
how you lose all your absurd ideas of hatred

00:01:52.317 --> 00:02:05.424
and of harming others, injuring others: all this kind of ideas

00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:13.588
which have worked out to give some sort of
a sadistic pleasure to many people,

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:22.917
and they have enjoyed the way they want to destroy

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:27.814
the joy of others, the happiness of others.

00:02:28.757 --> 00:02:35.603
To maintain the happiness, I know, you being Sahaja Yogis,

00:02:35.754 --> 00:02:42.390
you have to bear a lot, tolerate a lot of nonsense.

00:02:42.448 --> 00:02:48.452
You have already done it, and gradually once

00:02:48.571 --> 00:02:54.878
Sahaja Yoga is established in your own countries as something

00:02:55.338 --> 00:03:00.131
that is so beautiful, so very pure,

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:05.817
so very important that all others in your countries

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:14.398
also will try to follow that path which you have crossed over.

00:03:14.742 --> 00:03:19.343
Only your lives are the ones which will reflect

00:03:19.413 --> 00:03:25.592
the beauty of your inner being and of Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:27.468 --> 00:03:33.045
I told you yesterday what was missing in the human awareness,

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:37.379
and that the attention was not on the Spirit.

00:03:38.508 --> 00:03:44.541
But when it is on the Spirit, what happens to you?

00:03:44.723 --> 00:03:52.677
Firstly you become according to Sanskrit words, gunatit:

00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:57.360
you go beyond all the three gunas.

00:03:57.667 --> 00:04:06.719
That means you are no more a person who is tamo guni,

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:17.901
means the one who has got all kinds of desires of self-indulgence.

00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:24.643
Your attention moves from there to the second style

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.019
where you are rajo guni, the right-sidedness:

00:04:29.044 --> 00:04:31.952
they want to do something, want to show something,

00:04:31.992 --> 00:04:36.530
you want to become something, you want to compete with others.

00:04:36.623 --> 00:04:39.498
All this struggle just disappears.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.658
"Atit" means beyond.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.594
Then sattwa guni: that is also where you are seeking,

00:04:48.801 --> 00:04:54.280
where you see that what’s wrong in this kind of extreme behavior,

00:04:54.407 --> 00:04:58.112
and you just hate that kind of life

00:04:58.137 --> 00:05:03.667
and you want to get out of it, and then you start seeking.

00:05:04.232 --> 00:05:06.503
That also is finished.

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:13.531
All the gunas are finished, so you become gunatit.

00:05:14.173 --> 00:05:20.716
It just happens when your attention goes to your Spirit,

00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:28.204
because now the attention is not on any one of your inherent,

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:34.417
you can say, or conditioned qualities, or of egoistical qualities.

00:05:35.408 --> 00:05:42.246
So you become a person who is beyond this.

00:05:43.911 --> 00:05:50.128
This is something very remarkable as far as

00:05:50.153 --> 00:05:54.817
for normal life, but for you it is not, it just happens.

00:05:54.937 --> 00:05:57.588
You just enjoy being yourself.

00:05:58.025 --> 00:06:04.157
You’re no more concerned about your own conveniences,
comforts and petty things.

00:06:04.223 --> 00:06:08.825
But what happens is that you just go beyond

00:06:08.928 --> 00:06:12.587
all these three gunas which have been

00:06:12.755 --> 00:06:18.251
dominating you this way or that way.

00:06:21.566 --> 00:06:28.375
So that’s how you cross the limit of human awareness, firstly.

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:39.336
Then the second one is, you become kalatit: you go beyond time.

00:06:39.675 --> 00:06:43.715
I know today I was late somehow.

00:06:44.121 --> 00:06:46.407
It just works out that way.

00:06:46.432 --> 00:06:48.730
But you didn’t miss the time.

00:06:48.755 --> 00:06:52.510
You were still enjoying.
I could see, sitting in the house,

00:06:52.637 --> 00:06:55.381
that you are all in a very enjoyable mood,

00:06:55.406 --> 00:06:58.419
all of you are enjoying nicely.

00:06:58.444 --> 00:07:02.339
I’m not here, but still you are enjoying.

00:07:02.552 --> 00:07:04.862
This is beyond time.

00:07:04.887 --> 00:07:07.233
You’re not bound by time.

00:07:07.258 --> 00:07:11.207
Whatever is the time is your own, because

00:07:11.374 --> 00:07:13.937
you are standing in the present,

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:19.568
you are not standing here and thinking of the future.

00:07:19.879 --> 00:07:23.227
You didn’t think about what will happen tomorrow

00:07:23.252 --> 00:07:27.204
or how will you catch your plane, or how will you do this.

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.473
Here you were just enjoying,

00:07:29.513 --> 00:07:34.370
enjoying the present, and the present is the reality.

00:07:34.989 --> 00:07:39.299
If you are thinking of the future or of the past,

00:07:39.386 --> 00:07:42.553
then you are not in reality.
I have told many-a-times

00:07:42.767 --> 00:07:45.877
that past is finished and future doesn’t exist.

00:07:45.902 --> 00:07:49.906
So at this moment you are here sitting,

00:07:49.994 --> 00:07:53.875
perhaps may be waiting for Me, may be

00:07:53.938 --> 00:07:58.232
just enjoying every moment of your stay here,

00:07:58.336 --> 00:08:01.534
of your connections with others.

00:08:01.979 --> 00:08:05.558
And this enjoyment cannot be described,

00:08:05.638 --> 00:08:08.716
how you are enjoying this.

00:08:09.637 --> 00:08:12.693
Otherwise people would be seeing the watch,

00:08:12.765 --> 00:08:15.415
wondering, “Why Mother has not come?

00:08:15.449 --> 00:08:17.280
What is the problem?

00:08:17.305 --> 00:08:23.757
Why She is not arrived?” and all kinds of ideas can go round.

00:08:24.122 --> 00:08:27.643
It helps a lot to be kalatit.

00:08:27.904 --> 00:08:32.520
I remember in Nasik I had to work very hard because

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.773
no Sahaja Yogi would come forward to do anything,

00:08:35.798 --> 00:08:39.159
they were so shy and so much worried.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:43.932
And it so happened, luckily or unluckily we can say,

00:08:44.052 --> 00:08:46.694
that My car failed on the way and

00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:50.533
I was delayed in going.

00:08:50.769 --> 00:08:58.470
About one hour passed, there was no car coming that way,
there’s no way to go,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:01.695
and we were stranded on the road.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:05.716
Now surprisingly, when I reached the place

00:09:05.747 --> 00:09:11.635
where we were going to have the program,
the Sahaja Yogis took over.

00:09:11.805 --> 00:09:16.823
They took the responsibility, and they were very busy

00:09:17.458 --> 00:09:20.817
giving Realizations to others and working it out.

00:09:20.842 --> 00:09:22.714
Otherwise they would not.

00:09:22.739 --> 00:09:26.099
They could not believe that they have power to give Realization.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:29.691
I may tell them, but they would not raise their hands.

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:36.087
And just because the time was there
and they thought, “So many people are here,

00:09:36.112 --> 00:09:41.783
Mother is not coming or She may be coming,
so it’s our responsibility.”

00:09:41.937 --> 00:09:45.347
In that way they took the responsibility.

00:09:45.395 --> 00:09:50.805
So when you are beyond the time,
you become responsible for that moment.

00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.309
It’s such a responsibility which is also collective,

00:09:56.666 --> 00:10:01.558
means you just all of you become responsible.

00:10:03.256 --> 00:10:06.630
It’s very surprising, we are so many here,

00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:10.093
there’s no quarrel, no fight, nothing.

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:14.980
We are very nicely settled down, just beyond

00:10:15.005 --> 00:10:20.210
all kinds of stupid ideas of attacking each other.

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:27.508
That happens because you are not involved with the time.

00:10:27.659 --> 00:10:30.132
The time cannot bow you down.

00:10:30.272 --> 00:10:34.135
Perhaps if it were not you people, some other people,

00:10:34.246 --> 00:10:37.570
they would have thrown stones on My car,

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:43.332
thinking,  “So it is so late She comes,
we are here boiling in the heat.”

00:10:43.447 --> 00:10:45.757
They would have resented.

00:10:45.782 --> 00:10:49.181
But not the people who are beyond time.

00:10:49.459 --> 00:10:52.430
They are nicely sitting down, enjoying themselves.

00:10:52.701 --> 00:10:58.151
It doesn’t matter, the time passes on.

00:10:59.642 --> 00:11:05.928
Then you become dharmatit: you become beyond dharma,

00:11:06.793 --> 00:11:13.960
beyond your human nature.

00:11:15.114 --> 00:11:19.376
That means whatever you do is religious,

00:11:21.567 --> 00:11:26.135
whatever is your endeavor is religious.

00:11:27.580 --> 00:11:30.897
If, say, you are in a business,

00:11:31.135 --> 00:11:35.158
you would like to do business in a religious manner,

00:11:35.261 --> 00:11:40.168
because you are beyond religion you are not bothered as to

00:11:40.208 --> 00:11:44.620
follow a particular pattern or ritual of any religion,

00:11:45.002 --> 00:11:47.239
but you are beyond it.

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:56.134
Like people who are, you see, not beyond religion:

00:11:56.602 --> 00:12:01.132
they must get up early in the morning,  they are bound

00:12:01.624 --> 00:12:06.321
by their rituals and they pass through the rituals,

00:12:06.346 --> 00:12:11.169
and if one of the rituals is not done
they are very unhappy and shaken up.

00:12:11.311 --> 00:12:12.831
But not you.

00:12:12.935 --> 00:12:16.055
For you, you are always in dhyan,

00:12:16.119 --> 00:12:20.682
always in meditative mood, and anything goes wrong

00:12:20.883 --> 00:12:23.909
you just jump into that awareness

00:12:23.989 --> 00:12:28.277
where you get the solution, and you are not disturbed,

00:12:28.494 --> 00:12:33.704
not disturbed at all when things go wrong.

00:12:33.894 --> 00:12:39.460
Like ritualistic nature makes you very constricted,

00:12:39.634 --> 00:12:43.840
very docile, sometimes can be aggressive also.

00:12:44.103 --> 00:12:48.346
People with their ritualism trouble others a lot.

00:12:48.572 --> 00:12:54.051
Like one lady who was supposed to be our friend came to My house.

00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:57.474
So she said, "I’m a vegetarian."
I said, "Then?"

00:12:57.553 --> 00:13:03.933
"But I can’t eat the food in which non–veg. food has been cooked."

00:13:04.645 --> 00:13:05.814
"All right.

00:13:05.839 --> 00:13:09.010
So we’ll have to get new utensils."

00:13:09.035 --> 00:13:11.984
So I went and bought new utensils for her.

00:13:12.017 --> 00:13:14.941
So she said that "You have to be careful

00:13:15.021 --> 00:13:19.822
that even the spoon should not be used."

00:13:19.917 --> 00:13:22.979
So I had to go and get for her a spoon.

00:13:23.004 --> 00:13:29.461
Then she said, "Tumblers; because people are taking food here

00:13:29.734 --> 00:13:32.639
who are eating non–veg. food,

00:13:32.741 --> 00:13:38.216
so you better get us something which is absolutely new."

00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:41.268
So I had to incur all these problems.

00:13:41.514 --> 00:13:45.178
And then she was in the kitchen and she wouldn’t allow

00:13:45.256 --> 00:13:47.385
our cook to cook anything for us.

00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:50.776
She said, "First I will cook, and then you can cook."

00:13:50.879 --> 00:13:54.021
And she made such a nuisance out of her

00:13:54.092 --> 00:13:58.227
that instead of being a guest she became a pest,

00:13:58.747 --> 00:14:02.451
and this is what happens to people who are ritualistic,

00:14:02.498 --> 00:14:04.983
because they are very demanding.

00:14:05.007 --> 00:14:08.733
They go on demanding that “This is our dharma.”

00:14:08.954 --> 00:14:14.797
I know of another story was told to Me by somebody in Bombay.

00:14:14.929 --> 00:14:18.731
She said, "This lady who came to me as a guest, because

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.159
she was related to something very high up,

00:14:22.398 --> 00:14:26.831
she was worse than my great-great-great-grandmother."

00:14:26.926 --> 00:14:28.666
I said, "Really?"

00:14:28.691 --> 00:14:32.292
She said, "I can’t understand that in India

00:14:32.347 --> 00:14:34.839
we have such people still living.

00:14:34.871 --> 00:14:39.932
She came here and she said, ‘I cannot take water from the tap.

00:14:40.127 --> 00:14:43.887
You have to get it from some sort of a well.’

00:14:44.183 --> 00:14:47.674
“Now, there are only two wells in Bombay.

00:14:47.722 --> 00:14:51.243
So people had to go and fetch the water,

00:14:51.318 --> 00:14:56.008
but the cook had to be completely drenched in water

00:14:56.033 --> 00:14:58.390
and then only he could cook.

00:14:58.415 --> 00:15:01.824
“‘Because if he cooks without that, then I won’t eat.’

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:06.335
“And she went on, and on, and on there, and

00:15:06.425 --> 00:15:08.789
the cook got sick with pneumonia,

00:15:08.814 --> 00:15:12.718
another cook came and he got flu, you see?

00:15:12.743 --> 00:15:13.990
This lady didn’t mind.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:16.190
“She said, ‘No, that’s my style.’"

00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:20.469
So she asked Me, "What should we do with such people, Mother?"

00:15:20.494 --> 00:15:23.575
I said, "You should have asked her
that ‘We have this thing.

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.545
If you like it well and good; otherwise you don’t eat,

00:15:26.570 --> 00:15:30.733
it’s all right, good. Fasting is a very good thing.’

00:15:31.527 --> 00:15:36.306
That’s the only solution for such people who are so self-centered

00:15:36.331 --> 00:15:39.814
and so much bothering others.”

00:15:39.862 --> 00:15:42.927
So this self-centeredness comes to us

00:15:42.943 --> 00:15:45.800
because we think, "This is our dharma,

00:15:45.825 --> 00:15:50.430
this is our right, this is - everything belongs to us.

00:15:50.455 --> 00:15:53.335
How dare they do not do it?"

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:57.844
How much we trouble others, how much we make them inconvenient,

00:15:57.963 --> 00:16:05.191
how much we try to make their lives miserable,
we never think.

00:16:05.681 --> 00:16:08.152
We go on demanding things,

00:16:09.248 --> 00:16:13.224
“This is my dharma, what can I do?

00:16:13.638 --> 00:16:15.622
This is what I have to do.”

00:16:15.647 --> 00:16:18.948
But it becomes such a conditioning of the mind

00:16:19.353 --> 00:16:22.835
that I have seen many cases in Sahaja Yoga

00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.709
who got conditioned like that.

00:16:24.894 --> 00:16:29.489
There was a lady, French lady who came to Sahaja Yoga,

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:33.698
and her mother was very ritualistic to begin with,

00:16:33.928 --> 00:16:40.157
and she was so troublesome that she must go to church every Sunday.

00:16:40.449 --> 00:16:45.552
She would dress up well, go to church and come back home.

00:16:46.196 --> 00:16:48.666
And one day she just disappeared.

00:16:48.818 --> 00:16:51.862
So they told the police to find out this lady,

00:16:52.283 --> 00:16:55.794
and when he went to find out the lady,
the police said that

00:16:55.819 --> 00:16:59.162
"We can’t find her, God knows where she has disappeared."

00:16:59.391 --> 00:17:02.752
Then she said, "All right, go and find out in the church."

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.056
She was still sitting in the church.

00:17:05.187 --> 00:17:07.417
Next time again she disappeared.

00:17:07.481 --> 00:17:09.231
It happened three, four times.

00:17:09.256 --> 00:17:12.255
So the police said, "Sorry, we are finished with her.

00:17:12.280 --> 00:17:17.610
Now if you want you can put her in
the old people’s house, and that’s all."

00:17:17.906 --> 00:17:21.070
So they sent her to an old people’s house.

00:17:21.383 --> 00:17:25.867
So this Sahaja Yogini told Me, "Mother, very surprising,

00:17:25.986 --> 00:17:28.740
they are otherwise very stupid people,

00:17:28.827 --> 00:17:34.177
they go on sitting, brooding, talking nonsense like mad,

00:17:34.202 --> 00:17:39.445
they have all become senile and their senility can be very well seen.

00:17:39.524 --> 00:17:45.512
But what happens that on a Sunday
they all dress up well and go to church.

00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:49.913
That’s the only point where they are sane."

00:17:49.938 --> 00:17:53.313
It is very surprising how the conditioning works.

00:17:53.338 --> 00:17:56.139
There was one person I had

00:17:56.282 --> 00:18:00.345
who came and stayed with us, and he said, "I’m very good driver."

00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:01.953
So I said, "All right."

00:18:01.978 --> 00:18:04.662
But he only know driving, he didn’t know about London,

00:18:04.687 --> 00:18:06.988
what sort of a place London is.

00:18:07.054 --> 00:18:09.778
Now he knew the driving very well,

00:18:09.803 --> 00:18:14.329
but if I had to go to the north, he’ll drive Me to the south.

00:18:14.552 --> 00:18:18.198
If I had to go to the east, he’ll drive Me to the west.

00:18:18.223 --> 00:18:19.799
I said, "What’s the matter?

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:23.556
You know driving?"
"Yes, I know driving, that I know,

00:18:23.635 --> 00:18:27.430
but I don’t know anything about road, I have no road sense."

00:18:27.596 --> 00:18:29.424
One day the police got hold of him.

00:18:29.449 --> 00:18:30.924
I was also in the car.

00:18:30.949 --> 00:18:33.004
He said, "Where are you going?"

00:18:33.353 --> 00:18:36.447
He said, "I am going to such and such place."

00:18:36.472 --> 00:18:40.331
So he said, "Now you have been to this place six times.

00:18:40.356 --> 00:18:44.115
Again you are coming back to the same point six times!"

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:48.517
So in the old age I have known that these things form

00:18:48.574 --> 00:18:50.660
a kind of a habit,

00:18:50.745 --> 00:18:54.490
but in young age also you can find people

00:18:54.586 --> 00:18:57.641
get so conditioned by their style.

00:18:57.732 --> 00:19:03.097
So this is what you can call the human element,

00:19:03.122 --> 00:19:08.432
where you get attached or get bothered about something.

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:15.164
Now it’s a kind of a, I should say, a madness

00:19:15.403 --> 00:19:18.672
that somebody demands this, somebody demands that,

00:19:18.704 --> 00:19:21.780
"I don’t like this, I don’t like that."

00:19:21.780 --> 00:19:24.325
It goes on, and on, and on.

00:19:24.491 --> 00:19:29.552
It’s so common to say "I don’t like,” “I like."

00:19:29.923 --> 00:19:34.262
It is very surprising that they go on saying like this.

00:19:34.287 --> 00:19:38.448
They go to somebody’s house, "No, no, I don’t like this carpet."

00:19:38.473 --> 00:19:42.296
I mean, it’s not your carpet, you’ve not purchased it.

00:19:42.321 --> 00:19:44.216
This person has purchased the carpet.

00:19:44.241 --> 00:19:46.154
What have you got to do?

00:19:46.179 --> 00:19:47.857
Why should you say "I don’t like"?

00:19:47.882 --> 00:19:48.985
Who are you?

00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:50.471
You have not paid for you.

00:19:50.496 --> 00:19:53.624
The one who has paid likes it, finished!

00:19:53.743 --> 00:19:56.952
Why do you want to pass your remarks, "I don’t like it"?

00:19:56.977 --> 00:20:00.243
Are you a connoisseur, so to criticize others?

00:20:00.479 --> 00:20:04.321
Somebody is wearing, supposing, the hairdress in a way,

00:20:04.472 --> 00:20:07.562
but "I don’t like this kind of hairdress."

00:20:07.642 --> 00:20:08.828
"Why?"

00:20:08.853 --> 00:20:12.731
"I don’t like, that’s all."

00:20:19.304 --> 00:20:22.838
Then it goes from there to human beings and everyone.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:27.087
Who are you to like or dislike?

00:20:27.349 --> 00:20:29.293
What is your position?

00:20:29.404 --> 00:20:34.346
Why should you say “I like” or “don’t like”?

00:20:35.308 --> 00:20:38.374
But is very common, specially in the West,

00:20:38.565 --> 00:20:42.905
to pass such remarks, "I don’t like it."

00:20:43.272 --> 00:20:45.032
"I don’t like India."

00:20:45.057 --> 00:20:47.160
"All right, if you don’t like, sit at home.

00:20:47.185 --> 00:20:48.898
Why did you come here?"

00:20:48.947 --> 00:20:51.073
"I don’t like Turkey."

00:20:51.381 --> 00:20:52.668
"Why?"

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:57.857
Because if supposing anybody is wearing a long skirt,

00:20:57.934 --> 00:21:02.455
they’ll say, "No, I don’t like it because it is Turkish."

00:21:02.986 --> 00:21:05.911
So you should only wear short skirts.

00:21:06.189 --> 00:21:09.273
But we don’t like short skirts, supposing.

00:21:09.298 --> 00:21:12.501
But one should not say that "I don’t like it,"

00:21:12.526 --> 00:21:18.149
because it hurts people, it takes awaythe pride of the person.

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:23.101
Now when you are in Sahaja Yoga

00:21:23.133 --> 00:21:27.311
you must know that you are not normal human being,

00:21:27.336 --> 00:21:32.718
according to the normal standards, you see, you are above them.

00:21:33.141 --> 00:21:37.241
Your likes and dislikes are different from theirs,

00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:40.321
and your whole attitude has changed.

00:21:40.998 --> 00:21:45.670
You are, sometimes you are just like children, I have seen.

00:21:46.244 --> 00:21:51.073
You talk like small little children, very innocently,

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:54.926
and sometimes you talk very profound things.

00:21:55.307 --> 00:21:59.510
Now this is unknown to people who are supposed to be normal,

00:21:59.598 --> 00:22:03.464
because normal people, you know, they are so bombastic,

00:22:03.489 --> 00:22:08.949
all the time they go on saying "I, I, I."

00:22:10.015 --> 00:22:18.221
Kabira has said that when a goat is living,

00:22:18.642 --> 00:22:23.077
she goes on saying "meh, meh, meh," means "I, I, I."

00:22:23.654 --> 00:22:30.389
But when she is dead and her intestines are drawn into

00:22:30.874 --> 00:22:38.136
a kind of a wire for, we call dhunak - means

00:22:38.161 --> 00:22:42.293
“with which they separate the seeds from the cotton"

00:22:42.365 --> 00:22:46.131
- that time, what she says, "tu hi, tu hi, tu hi”:

00:22:46.156 --> 00:22:52.503
“you are, you are, you are." You are...

00:22:53.940 --> 00:23:00.590
When you say that, immediately
your attention goes away from others,

00:23:00.758 --> 00:23:05.312
finding faults with them, finding what’s wrong with them,

00:23:05.399 --> 00:23:09.939
using your brains all the time to criticize others,

00:23:10.307 --> 00:23:15.525
to make fun of others, sometimes even to talk ill of others.

00:23:15.551 --> 00:23:17.782
People enjoy gossips.

00:23:17.886 --> 00:23:19.123
Why?

00:23:19.164 --> 00:23:21.360
They enjoy gossip

00:23:21.464 --> 00:23:26.440
because they don’t know that another person is the same as myself,

00:23:26.784 --> 00:23:30.397
and I have no business to gossip about that person.

00:23:30.422 --> 00:23:34.460
So this understanding, I should say this loving

00:23:34.485 --> 00:23:39.121
wisdom doesn’t exist when you are a normal human being.

00:23:39.404 --> 00:23:44.176
At the slightest provocation you can get angry,

00:23:44.305 --> 00:23:49.214
start doing all kinds of things just like a bull in the

00:23:49.556 --> 00:23:52.246
china shop, you can behave any way.

00:23:52.397 --> 00:23:56.220
Suddenly you’ll find them just growing up into that.

00:23:56.245 --> 00:24:00.455
The reason for that is, you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:24:01.138 --> 00:24:05.802
But Sahaja Yogi is a person who enjoys all kinds of things.

00:24:06.636 --> 00:24:12.339
Say somebody becomes very angry and hot-tempered.

00:24:13.042 --> 00:24:20.127
He also sees that what is happening, how he is behaving.

00:24:20.652 --> 00:24:26.652
So, actually it is not a dharma
that you get angry with someone, it’s not.

00:24:26.723 --> 00:24:31.624
It is something very low to be angry with others,

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:36.903
to be all the time shouting at others,
to be exacting things from others

00:24:36.928 --> 00:24:42.227
or to criticize others, thinking you are something great.

00:24:42.372 --> 00:24:44.134
And this doesn’t pay.

00:24:45.006 --> 00:24:47.889
By the time you come to the end of life you’ll find

00:24:47.913 --> 00:24:51.429
you haven’t got one friend, one neighbor.

00:24:52.653 --> 00:24:57.541
Another thing is that when you are very egoistical,

00:24:58.192 --> 00:25:00.657
you think no end of yourself

00:25:00.753 --> 00:25:04.803
and you go on talking, jabbering, talking, jabbering,

00:25:04.938 --> 00:25:08.032
and the another person just gets bored stiff;

00:25:08.269 --> 00:25:11.576
but still you are talking, talking, talking about yourself,

00:25:11.626 --> 00:25:14.264
"I did this, I did this, I went there.

00:25:14.289 --> 00:25:16.409
I, I, I…"

00:25:18.126 --> 00:25:24.290
It goes to any limit,
and you are not ashamed as to what you are saying.

00:25:25.558 --> 00:25:31.806
I have seen people who have taken to all kinds of

00:25:32.111 --> 00:25:38.726
funny attitudes towards others,
when they are just normal human beings.

00:25:39.665 --> 00:25:45.956
If somebody says something wrong about somebody,
somebody says that

00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:50.453
"That person is like this, I know, you see he did this way."

00:25:50.478 --> 00:25:54.618
Immediately it goes into their mind, "Yes, it’s so."

00:25:55.062 --> 00:26:01.532
Now that makes your mind a sick mind,

00:26:02.334 --> 00:26:07.309
we can say vikrudh, where the mind is not normal.

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:11.382
You become sick, and you accept all this sickness

00:26:11.485 --> 00:26:18.765
and go on accepting it, accepting it till you are a sick person,

00:26:19.248 --> 00:26:24.060
and this sickness is extremely dangerous.

00:26:24.195 --> 00:26:27.112
Not for others so much as for yourself,

00:26:27.247 --> 00:26:31.501
because nobody can stand such a sick personality.

00:26:31.928 --> 00:26:37.818
Now you might say, I’ve seen people who have taken to religion.

00:26:38.127 --> 00:26:44.289
Like now I am a religious person, supposing now.

00:26:46.123 --> 00:26:49.797
You better be religious, so what?

00:26:49.822 --> 00:26:52.075
You can’t do this, you can’t do that,

00:26:52.147 --> 00:26:56.688
you cannot sit here, you cannot eat this, this is important:

00:26:56.713 --> 00:27:02.124
all try type the discipline others,
instead of disciplining yourself.

00:27:02.648 --> 00:27:06.827
Because when you are a normal person you don’t see yourself,

00:27:07.336 --> 00:27:11.791
you just see others; but once you are a realized soul,

00:27:11.822 --> 00:27:17.553
you just start watching yourself and see for yourself what’s wrong.

00:27:18.472 --> 00:27:25.236
Now after becoming the Spirit,
in the light of the Spirit you see yourself.

00:27:26.244 --> 00:27:28.140
You just see yourself.

00:27:28.858 --> 00:27:32.208
What happens, how you behave

00:27:32.333 --> 00:27:38.502
and how you enjoy yourself, when you know how to correct yourself.

00:27:38.764 --> 00:27:40.644
It’s very sweet.

00:27:40.994 --> 00:27:45.314
Little, little things you do in such a beautiful manner,

00:27:45.378 --> 00:27:48.393
and you’ll say such beautiful things.

00:27:48.425 --> 00:27:55.235
Of course there are people
who cannot be corrected, they’re incorrigible.

00:27:55.260 --> 00:28:00.589
So also you should just see this is incorrigible, you can’t help it.

00:28:00.700 --> 00:28:03.579
Like in Sahaja Yoga we have some people

00:28:03.643 --> 00:28:07.582
who are all the time trying to help the wrong type of people,

00:28:07.902 --> 00:28:12.316
like they have taken a power of attorney in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:12.341 --> 00:28:16.395
So if somebody tries to be funny,

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:20.086
we expect a telephone call from that power of attorney.

00:28:20.211 --> 00:28:23.370
After two hours, he tells, “Now,

00:28:23.395 --> 00:28:27.800
please tell Mother that such and such person is to be looked after.

00:28:27.825 --> 00:28:30.000
This has to be done, that has to be done.”

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.204
It’s absolutely a habitual thing with them

00:28:33.229 --> 00:28:37.368
to inform Me that “No, You must help, You must do something.”

00:28:38.311 --> 00:28:41.263
But now it has become such a common practice,

00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:45.041
and we know that he will just now come along

00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:48.237
and give us a big lecture on this subject.

00:28:48.442 --> 00:28:53.837
So you see, it’s a nature of a human being

00:28:53.893 --> 00:28:58.922
which has been going through the different types of

00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:06.167
complications in life,  also born with some genes or something

00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:12.288
that he is not a very normal person, though we say he’s normal;

00:29:12.446 --> 00:29:18.863
because the way he reacts, the reaction that he shows is very absurd.

00:29:18.974 --> 00:29:23.448
There’s no need for anybody to telephone to Me, to tell Me

00:29:23.473 --> 00:29:30.101
that “You see, this man is such and such, You better look after him.”

00:29:30.490 --> 00:29:35.171
Unnecessarily to interfere with others’ affairs

00:29:35.354 --> 00:29:38.179
when you have no authority,

00:29:38.869 --> 00:29:42.135
when you have nothing to do with that person.

00:29:42.226 --> 00:29:46.649
All sorts of, I can tell you, designs are there that

00:29:46.832 --> 00:29:50.906
has been made into the minds of human beings,

00:29:51.025 --> 00:29:55.514
and these designs all disappear, just disappear.

00:29:55.641 --> 00:29:59.248
I don’t know how they get all these designs, from where they get it -

00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.779
maybe their country, maybe their family, maybe their genes -

00:30:03.804 --> 00:30:08.928
whatever you may say, all this disappears, even your genes change.

00:30:09.294 --> 00:30:15.930
That is what is Sahaja Yoga,
where you become the Spirit; everything changes.

00:30:16.225 --> 00:30:21.166
And what happens to you, that you become

00:30:21.444 --> 00:30:26.833
a person who knows what is joy, who enjoys joy,

00:30:26.858 --> 00:30:31.395
who enjoys existence, who gives joy to others,

00:30:31.420 --> 00:30:36.950
makes others happy, all the time thinks how to make others happy.

00:30:37.116 --> 00:30:39.284
Just it happens,

00:30:39.372 --> 00:30:42.843
though you are brought up the same way as others are,

00:30:42.868 --> 00:30:46.930
though you are being educated the same way,  maybe;

00:30:47.128 --> 00:30:54.335
but all that disappears
and you become a wise, beautiful joyous person.

00:30:56.333 --> 00:31:00.631
It’s something that you have achieved, of which you may not be aware,

00:31:00.671 --> 00:31:05.641
the way you are enjoying in this scout-ground.

00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:09.029
No other group could have enjoyed as you have enjoyed.

00:31:09.084 --> 00:31:12.977
I can see what you are doing here and how you are enjoying,

00:31:13.295 --> 00:31:16.715
how you are enjoying the company of others,
it’s very remarkable;

00:31:17.016 --> 00:31:22.333
and that has come because your heart is full of joy

00:31:22.428 --> 00:31:25.055
of the Spirit that shines within you.

00:31:25.505 --> 00:31:28.487
You can examine yourself and see for yourself

00:31:28.527 --> 00:31:32.042
whatever I‘m saying is there or not of course,

00:31:32.112 --> 00:31:35.230
There are some people who think no end of themself,

00:31:35.255 --> 00:31:38.905
they are staying in a hotel or some lodge, or something.

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:40.578
They are not enjoying.

00:31:41.126 --> 00:31:43.735
They still think that they are something great,

00:31:43.814 --> 00:31:47.845
so they must stay somewhere like that.

00:31:48.044 --> 00:31:50.932
Very surprisingly, specially Indians I have seen,

00:31:50.957 --> 00:31:56.776
when they come to Cabella they all want to stay in a hotel.

00:31:56.902 --> 00:32:01.252
In their lives they might be having one bathroom in their house,

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:04.780
but when they come to Cabella they want to stay in a hotel

00:32:04.805 --> 00:32:08.264
with attached bath,  this, that;

00:32:09.504 --> 00:32:12.211
young people, it’s very surprising.

00:32:12.315 --> 00:32:16.242
It happens because I think they have never seen a good hotel,

00:32:16.267 --> 00:32:19.641
or may be that they have lived in a very bad condition.

00:32:19.712 --> 00:32:25.544
But a person who is a Sahaja Yogi
can live anywhere, can sleep anywhere.

00:32:26.157 --> 00:32:32.106
Only thing is that his Spirit is there to make him happy,
nothing else.

00:32:32.343 --> 00:32:35.388
That is the One that gives you happiness.

00:32:35.413 --> 00:32:41.863
All these other ideas that human beings have,
which have created problems after problems.

00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:48.610
Now you see, because you belong to a different religion, you are bad.

00:32:48.878 --> 00:32:51.600
If you want to know about the Christians,

00:32:51.656 --> 00:32:54.667
you’d better go and ask the Jews;

00:32:54.692 --> 00:32:58.698
and if you want to know about the Jews, better go and ask the Muslims;

00:32:58.723 --> 00:33:03.002
and if you want to know about the Muslims, go and ask the Hindus.

00:33:03.901 --> 00:33:07.479
You’ll be amazed how they talk about other people

00:33:07.566 --> 00:33:10.826
as if all of them are bad, and they are the best.

00:33:10.874 --> 00:33:16.010
So this whole attitude changes completely.

00:33:16.246 --> 00:33:21.262
You forget it: who is what, whose religion is what,

00:33:21.287 --> 00:33:27.007
from what sort of family they come in,
from what is the background they are coming in.

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:30.311
They become just one with each other.

00:33:30.496 --> 00:33:34.766
What they enjoy is the company of all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:38.304
All the Sahaja Yogis are there, that’s all.

00:33:38.383 --> 00:33:42.603
So many Sahaja Yogis will be there, and that is the Mecca,

00:33:42.655 --> 00:33:47.689
that is the Kumbha Mela, that you can call anything if you like.

00:33:47.799 --> 00:33:51.638
The collective joy that you enjoy has come to you

00:33:51.722 --> 00:33:55.656
because you have crossed, crossed thatbarrier

00:33:55.736 --> 00:34:00.161
which has stopped you from seeing the truth.

00:34:00.542 --> 00:34:05.350
The truth is, as I said yesterday, that you are the Spirit,

00:34:05.375 --> 00:34:13.766
and once you become the Spirit
you become gunatit, kalatit and dharmatit.

00:34:13.901 --> 00:34:20.277
Once you cross these limits, then you become like a drop in the ocean.

00:34:20.415 --> 00:34:23.690
If the drop is outside the ocean,

00:34:23.768 --> 00:34:27.625
it’s always frightened of the sun because it will dry it up;

00:34:27.936 --> 00:34:32.196
he doesn’t know what to do, which way to slip, which way to move.

00:34:32.221 --> 00:34:35.771
But once it is one with the ocean, it just moves

00:34:35.796 --> 00:34:39.940
and enjoy because he’s not alone, it’s not alone.

00:34:39.965 --> 00:34:45.914
It’s moving with the waves of that beautiful ocean of joy.

00:34:46.184 --> 00:34:50.333
And that is what you have achieved, of which you are aware;

00:34:50.358 --> 00:34:53.185
you know, but you don’t know you have achieved it,

00:34:53.233 --> 00:34:55.756
because you are the Spirit.

00:34:56.706 --> 00:34:59.074
Now you should be on the watch

00:34:59.709 --> 00:35:04.949
about yourself sometimes,
and you’d be amazed to see how you are changed,

00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:11.466
how you have become so simple and sensible and wise.

00:35:11.923 --> 00:35:15.380
So many problems come in the West because

00:35:15.405 --> 00:35:20.193
they are still stupid, I think, very stupid people.

00:35:20.319 --> 00:35:25.858
Because even an old man of eighty years

00:35:25.922 --> 00:35:31.239
would like to marry a lady who seen 20 years

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.720
and he doesn’t understand why he is doing it,

00:35:36.499 --> 00:35:39.673
because he doesn’t accept his age,

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:44.630
he doesn’t accept that "I am an old man,
I must behave like an old man."

00:35:45.054 --> 00:35:51.892
He wants to marry a girl who can be his granddaughter.

00:35:52.249 --> 00:35:54.616
This is more common in the West.

00:35:54.641 --> 00:35:56.381
They always think like that.

00:35:56.406 --> 00:36:00.085
Any young girl they see, they think they should marry that girl.

00:36:00.314 --> 00:36:05.576
They may be just on their way to the grave,

00:36:05.735 --> 00:36:09.312
but doesn’t matter, they want to have a wife like that.

00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.599
This is the problem of the West.

00:36:11.694 --> 00:36:13.438
Now how does it come?

00:36:13.463 --> 00:36:18.502
Because they don’t understand that we are old,

00:36:18.844 --> 00:36:21.217
and to be old is to be proud.

00:36:21.242 --> 00:36:23.840
Now when I was five years,

00:36:23.865 --> 00:36:28.883
I cannot imagine so many people could have
come to wish Me a happy birthday.

00:36:29.153 --> 00:36:32.483
Even when I was fifty years there were not so many people.

00:36:32.508 --> 00:36:38.146
Now when I am seventy-five, see
how many people are there to wish Me happy birthday!

00:36:38.812 --> 00:36:42.455
When you are old you should be proud of your age,

00:36:42.638 --> 00:36:46.482
if you have lived wisely; but if you have been stupid,

00:36:46.507 --> 00:36:48.893
then of course nobody can help.

00:36:49.261 --> 00:36:54.339
Everybody will laugh at such a person,
but they will do the same thing.

00:36:54.514 --> 00:36:59.806
It’s a custom in the West to go on having wives after wives,

00:36:59.831 --> 00:37:02.118
divorcing your wife and this, that.

00:37:02.838 --> 00:37:05.416
In India it’s the other way round I should say,

00:37:05.441 --> 00:37:09.377
they don’t have much respect for the women.

00:37:09.433 --> 00:37:14.202
They were supposed to have great respect for women,

00:37:14.227 --> 00:37:19.349
supposed to have placed their women at the pedestal of a sati,

00:37:19.508 --> 00:37:23.774
and even if the woman may be anything, they don’t respect.

00:37:23.801 --> 00:37:27.436
Now this is from where it has come, I don’t know.

00:37:27.461 --> 00:37:33.247
Some of them say that it is written by some poet

00:37:34.057 --> 00:37:35.725
that a woman should be beaten up.

00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:37.020
I mean, who is this poet?

00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:40.220
He should be beaten up I think, first of all.

00:37:40.601 --> 00:37:46.166
He was born out of a woman, and here he writes like this.

00:37:46.322 --> 00:37:51.527
So you see, we like to take up something which is wrong,

00:37:51.813 --> 00:37:54.257
which is absolutely absurd.

00:37:54.392 --> 00:37:58.770
This comes because you are not wise.

00:37:59.098 --> 00:38:04.125
A wise person will take in whatever is the wisdom.

00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:08.266
He won’t accept anything nonsensical.

00:38:08.396 --> 00:38:12.374
You go on reading the books one after another, one after another.

00:38:12.533 --> 00:38:16.610
So many books you read, and where do you land up with that?

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:20.892
You find you are reading books which are no good for you,

00:38:20.917 --> 00:38:25.559
useless, but if you are fond of reading, you go on reading.

00:38:26.908 --> 00:38:34.773
So the lack of wisdom gives you indiscrimination

00:38:35.242 --> 00:38:38.813
and you justify it, all that you justify

00:38:38.838 --> 00:38:41.150
and you say, "Now this is very good.

00:38:41.175 --> 00:38:43.501
Whatever I am doing is the best.”

00:38:43.526 --> 00:38:48.492
It’s not ego, I would say, but stupid human understanding.

00:38:49.016 --> 00:38:52.061
"Whatever I am doing is good.

00:38:52.086 --> 00:38:55.006
Whatever is my attitude is good.

00:38:55.031 --> 00:38:59.941
How dare anybody tell me anything that this is wrong, that is wrong?"

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:03.980
Everybody will laugh at that person, make fun of that person.

00:39:04.061 --> 00:39:06.640
Such a person will suffer a lot, everything.

00:39:06.665 --> 00:39:11.810
But he will never accept that "I have done something wrong."

00:39:12.111 --> 00:39:16.872
So when you go beyond dharmatit you become, go beyond dharma,

00:39:16.897 --> 00:39:21.109
then what happens that dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

00:39:21.735 --> 00:39:26.285
You don’t do wrong things, you just don’t do it.

00:39:26.730 --> 00:39:30.148
It’s not that somebody is telling you or you want to follow it,

00:39:30.181 --> 00:39:32.999
or there is compulsion or you are disciplined,

00:39:33.024 --> 00:39:36.925
but you just don’t like to do wrong things, to say something

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:42.051
which is not respectful, which is not helpful, which is not loving.

00:39:42.312 --> 00:39:46.237
This is the quality of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:39:46.285 --> 00:39:49.007
where you become the Spirit.

00:39:49.232 --> 00:39:52.394
Becoming the Spirit, you don’t have to tell anybody,

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:56.157
so obvious, so evident and one can see that,

00:39:56.271 --> 00:40:00.857
and the more you go deep into yourself, you find that

00:40:00.944 --> 00:40:06.541
you are endowed with such greatness within you,

00:40:06.566 --> 00:40:12.088
such beautiful feelings, such nice things within you

00:40:12.113 --> 00:40:16.536
that you overcome the ego of others.

00:40:16.695 --> 00:40:18.415
I must tell you a story.

00:40:18.440 --> 00:40:21.978
Once I went to see a saint.

00:40:22.173 --> 00:40:23.380
So the Sahaja Yogis said,

00:40:23.381 --> 00:40:26.644
"Mother, You never go and see these gurus and this and that,

00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:29.035
so why do You go?"
I said, "You come along with Me."

00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:30.559
So we had to climb a lot.

00:40:30.584 --> 00:40:32.536
I said, "From here you see his vibrations.

00:40:32.561 --> 00:40:34.182
First you see his vibrations.”

00:40:34.689 --> 00:40:37.327
So lots of vibrations were coming.

00:40:37.352 --> 00:40:41.593
So we went up the hill, climbed up.

00:40:41.908 --> 00:40:46.641
And this gentleman was supposed to have powers

00:40:46.729 --> 00:40:52.812
that he could control the rain, and it started raining,

00:40:52.923 --> 00:40:58.069
and raining very heavily,
and I got completely drenched in that rain.

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:01.705
When I went up I saw him sitting on a stone,

00:41:01.730 --> 00:41:05.263
just shaking his head with anger or I don’t know what.

00:41:05.748 --> 00:41:08.631
So I went into his cave and sat down.

00:41:09.433 --> 00:41:14.678
So he came back, he came back and he said to Me,

00:41:14.703 --> 00:41:19.728
"Mother, why didn’t You allow me to stop the rain?

00:41:19.879 --> 00:41:23.144
Is it to overcome my ego?"

00:41:23.169 --> 00:41:27.318
I said, "No, not that, I didn’t want,

00:41:27.343 --> 00:41:32.038
I didn’t see your ego anywhere; but the problem is the another.

00:41:32.204 --> 00:41:35.731
You are a sanyasi, you are a one who are an ascetic,

00:41:35.756 --> 00:41:37.396
you bought a sari for Me.

00:41:37.525 --> 00:41:41.999
Now if you bought a sari for Me,
I can’t take from you because you’re a sanyasi.

00:41:42.024 --> 00:41:47.481
So I had to get drenched,
so that I will have to borrow sari from you."

00:41:47.506 --> 00:41:51.706
And the whole thing melted away.

00:41:51.929 --> 00:41:54.829
He became a very different person.

00:41:54.854 --> 00:41:59.907
So with wisdom you know how to handle different types of people.

00:41:59.993 --> 00:42:06.881
You say things by which you melt their ego.

00:42:07.046 --> 00:42:16.495
Their conditionings also are brought into a kind of a new awakening.

00:42:17.646 --> 00:42:23.697
They see in you that wisdom, that love, that expression of,

00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.348
I should say, your Spirit.

00:42:26.554 --> 00:42:33.487
And that’s how so many saints,
though they were tortured and troubled by many,

00:42:33.526 --> 00:42:38.810
but they were definitely very much respected and loved.

00:42:39.224 --> 00:42:48.068
But those saints in those days, I must say,
were definitely very nice and good people,

00:42:48.176 --> 00:42:55.386
but one thing was there: they were rather strict
and disciplining with their disciples.

00:42:55.528 --> 00:43:00.306
The reason was that they were not realized souls, their disciples,

00:43:00.362 --> 00:43:05.905
and these gurus thought that “Unless and until
ou discipline these people,

00:43:06.016 --> 00:43:09.489
they’ll never rise, they’ll never become something great,

00:43:09.545 --> 00:43:11.675
so they have to be disciplined.”

00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:14.862
And those who were seekers of truth accepted

00:43:14.887 --> 00:43:18.509
that "All right, whatever you say, we’ll do.

00:43:18.613 --> 00:43:21.225
Even if you ask us to fast, we’ll do it.”

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.079
They’ll stand on their heads, “All right, stand on our heads.

00:43:24.079 --> 00:43:27.404
Do what you say, and we will be willing to do it.

00:43:27.429 --> 00:43:29.993
You don’t have to worry on that point."

00:43:30.018 --> 00:43:33.005
And that’s how they were very disciplining type.

00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:36.510
But in Sahaja Yoga there is no discipline taught.

00:43:36.794 --> 00:43:40.085
The reason is, you are realized souls,

00:43:40.110 --> 00:43:44.838
your Spirit is there and the Spirit gives you the light.

00:43:44.957 --> 00:43:50.787
In that light you see yourself so clearly,
and you can discipline yourself.

00:43:50.889 --> 00:43:52.779
I don’t have to tell you.

00:43:52.804 --> 00:43:57.367
You know that so many people have given up drugs overnight,

00:43:57.407 --> 00:44:00.278
but I never told them, I never even talked about  drugs

00:44:00.303 --> 00:44:03.223
or anything, and how did they do it?

00:44:03.248 --> 00:44:07.884
Because they had the light, and this is what is you have got today,

00:44:07.909 --> 00:44:10.198
is the light of the Spirit.

00:44:10.262 --> 00:44:13.536
You become absolutely independent

00:44:13.671 --> 00:44:17.544
and absolutely free; complete freedom,

00:44:17.592 --> 00:44:20.093
because you have the light.

00:44:20.204 --> 00:44:25.874
You cannot do, you cannot do wrong things.

00:44:26.841 --> 00:44:31.380
Supposing now there is light,

00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:37.436
and there is some sort of a big explosion taking place.

00:44:37.663 --> 00:44:40.711
I won’t run towards the explosion, no.

00:44:40.782 --> 00:44:45.425
You won’t run either, because you have got the eyes.

00:44:45.450 --> 00:44:50.510
So the Spirit and its light is the greatest guiding factor

00:44:50.836 --> 00:44:55.383
by which you become, as I said, gunatit,

00:44:57.489 --> 00:45:03.650
you become kalatit, and you become dharmatit.

00:45:04.252 --> 00:45:06.556
You are not slave of anything.

00:45:06.581 --> 00:45:10.326
You are not slave of your watch, you are not slave of time,

00:45:10.351 --> 00:45:15.487
you are not slave as to what is your gunas are.

00:45:15.613 --> 00:45:20.890
You don’t want to see whether
you are right-sided, left-sided or centered.

00:45:21.178 --> 00:45:28.986
You are a Sahaja Yogi, and a Sahaja Yogi is beyond all these things,
so you are gunatit.

00:45:29.293 --> 00:45:33.642
You are dharmatit because dharma becomes part and parcel of you.

00:45:33.697 --> 00:45:38.348
You don’t have to follow any disciplining of dharma.

00:45:38.373 --> 00:45:44.382
I have seen in Sahaja Yoga, in some of the ashrams
they are very strict.

00:45:44.612 --> 00:45:45.825
That should not be so.

00:45:45.850 --> 00:45:48.157
I have told them never to be strict.

00:45:48.182 --> 00:45:52.536
If somebody doesn’t get up at, say, four o’clock, doesn’t matter.

00:45:52.575 --> 00:45:54.839
Let him get up at ten o’clock.

00:45:54.914 --> 00:45:58.773
After some time he himself will get up at four,

00:45:58.806 --> 00:46:01.668
but don’t try to discipline them too much.

00:46:01.787 --> 00:46:04.807
Children also you should not discipline too much.

00:46:04.965 --> 00:46:09.801
Of course if they are realized souls, they themselves are so good,

00:46:09.826 --> 00:46:11.298
they are so beautiful.

00:46:11.323 --> 00:46:14.478
But if they are not, try to give them Realization.

00:46:14.503 --> 00:46:18.105
Once you realize that those who are not realized

00:46:18.169 --> 00:46:22.461
are making all these mistakes, that they are in the darkness,

00:46:22.486 --> 00:46:26.197
your attitude towards them will change.

00:46:26.297 --> 00:46:30.886
You will just try to be extremely patient

00:46:31.331 --> 00:46:35.338
and kind, and affectionate and loving,

00:46:35.403 --> 00:46:38.535
because you will know that person is not realized.

00:46:38.686 --> 00:46:43.320
He has not got his eyes, he can’t see, he is blind,

00:46:43.345 --> 00:46:49.112
he can’t hear, he can’t feel the reality.

00:46:49.373 --> 00:46:51.874
So first let him feel the reality.

00:46:51.899 --> 00:46:55.012
What is the use of giving him a lecture and disciplining?

00:46:55.037 --> 00:47:00.217
Still he’ll go on making mistakes
and troubling himself, or troubling others.

00:47:00.242 --> 00:47:02.556
So this is what you have achieved

00:47:02.581 --> 00:47:07.581
through your enlightenment, that you are beyond all these things.

00:47:08.248 --> 00:47:12.076
And you become a person of a temperament

00:47:12.148 --> 00:47:18.012
which is so loving and so joy-giving.

00:47:18.241 --> 00:47:23.704
I mean, it’s so many examples I can give in Sahaja Yoga
which has happened,

00:47:23.773 --> 00:47:28.583
that I have seen the beauty of their love and affection,

00:47:28.608 --> 00:47:32.564
not only towards Me, but only towards others also.

00:47:32.589 --> 00:47:38.235
Only if it is only towards Me I can explain it,

00:47:38.347 --> 00:47:43.594
but I can’t explain the way they are kind to people,
as I told you yesterday,

00:47:43.619 --> 00:47:45.846
that these people went to Israel,

00:47:45.871 --> 00:47:49.340
now they went to Egypt, they went to Russia.

00:47:49.365 --> 00:47:50.349
Who told them?

00:47:50.349 --> 00:47:52.725
I never asked anybody to go anywhere.

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:56.291
On their own they felt they have to go  and do this job,

00:47:56.316 --> 00:48:01.850
and they have to help people to get out of their ignorance.

00:48:03.163 --> 00:48:07.650
So today, on such a day when you are celebrating

00:48:07.793 --> 00:48:12.546
My seventy-fifth Birthday, and so many balloons are there -

00:48:28.064 --> 00:48:33.366
they are very remarkably, very picturesque

00:48:33.391 --> 00:48:39.053
and have colors of different types, expressing your love for Me.

00:48:40.397 --> 00:48:43.289
In everything I see your love.

00:48:43.410 --> 00:48:47.741
Whatever you have done here, all your decorations, everything,

00:48:47.876 --> 00:48:53.344
I feel My children are so loving.

00:48:53.726 --> 00:48:58.802
I have done nothing for you,
I don’t know what makes you feel such gratitude.

00:48:58.945 --> 00:49:01.450
I still want to know, what have I done?

00:49:01.475 --> 00:49:02.981
I have done nothing!

00:49:03.006 --> 00:49:06.051
But the way you want to express your love,

00:49:06.131 --> 00:49:10.538
it’s very surprising; except for, I would say,

00:49:10.563 --> 00:49:15.223
that you got the light of your Spirit.

00:49:15.322 --> 00:49:20.375
In that light, might be you see something different in Me,

00:49:21.447 --> 00:49:28.169
but the way you are showing your gratitude is really beyond Me.

00:49:28.295 --> 00:49:31.190
As the other day, one of the speakers said that

00:49:31.215 --> 00:49:33.945
“You don’t thank your mother, take her for granted.”

00:49:33.970 --> 00:49:35.050
It’s a fact.

00:49:35.223 --> 00:49:39.013
There’s no need to thank Me, you have to take Me for granted.

00:49:39.038 --> 00:49:42.596
But the way you want to thank Me, just like a

00:49:42.621 --> 00:49:47.782
small little child would like to thank, you just become like children.

00:49:48.029 --> 00:49:50.623
You’re so enthusiastic about it,

00:49:50.655 --> 00:49:56.981
and you don’t understand that
normally is not done like this anywhere;

00:49:57.076 --> 00:50:03.000
nobody tries to be just like children expressing
their beautiful love.

00:50:03.442 --> 00:50:08.594
It’s a very new thing that one can see.

00:50:08.743 --> 00:50:14.301
Such peace, such love, such joy all around

00:50:14.595 --> 00:50:19.878
in a far-fetched place like this, how could you do that?

00:50:20.312 --> 00:50:22.121
How could you manage that?

00:50:22.446 --> 00:50:29.687
It’s not easy to understand,
it’s not for human beings to see that.

00:50:30.375 --> 00:50:34.157
They just don’t understand how these people are like this,

00:50:34.197 --> 00:50:38.536
and why are they living like this so happily?

00:50:38.987 --> 00:50:44.437
Now you have comforts in the house,
you are living so well in your houses,

00:50:44.588 --> 00:50:47.691
everything is there, but here in this scout-ground

00:50:47.708 --> 00:50:50.481
it’s not such a comfortable place to live.

00:50:50.506 --> 00:50:53.487
But you can live anywhere, I know, I have seen it.

00:50:53.512 --> 00:50:56.645
Wherever you are, as long as there are Sahaja Yogis around,

00:50:56.693 --> 00:50:58.780
you don’t care for anything.

00:50:58.805 --> 00:51:03.961
And this collective enjoyment of each other,

00:51:04.112 --> 00:51:07.484
without any expectation, without any criticism,

00:51:07.509 --> 00:51:12.529
without any gossip or any nonsense like that, is so beautiful.

00:51:12.561 --> 00:51:16.816
And even when you pull each other’s legs,
you know, I enjoy your jokes

00:51:16.841 --> 00:51:23.516
and understand that it’s such friendship,
such beautiful friendship.

00:51:23.634 --> 00:51:30.137
Whether you are from India or from England
or from America, or from any other place,

00:51:30.162 --> 00:51:34.317
you find there’s such oneness of understanding,

00:51:34.421 --> 00:51:40.568
oneness of movement,  like one waves rises

00:51:40.593 --> 00:51:44.223
and another wave rises, and another wave rises.

00:51:44.248 --> 00:51:52.406
It’s continuous, eternal, and this is
what one has to achieve for others also.

00:51:52.639 --> 00:51:58.153
For that also, must remember that
you have the light; others don’t have.

00:51:58.199 --> 00:52:03.633
So you have to be very considerate, tolerant and understanding

00:52:03.658 --> 00:52:08.504
about their problem, and just listen to them.

00:52:08.590 --> 00:52:09.917
What is their problem?

00:52:09.942 --> 00:52:14.809
First they’ll tell you that “My business is going down,”

00:52:14.865 --> 00:52:19.968
or they might say that  “My wife is no good,”

00:52:20.047 --> 00:52:24.814
or “My son has no job, he is not working.”

00:52:24.849 --> 00:52:27.350
All kinds of things they might tell you.

00:52:27.375 --> 00:52:31.713
Listen, listen to them, for them it is important, all right.

00:52:31.738 --> 00:52:37.971
After that you will find gradually, you see,
they’ll soothe down

00:52:38.099 --> 00:52:43.418
because you are emitting love,  you are emitting joy,

00:52:43.450 --> 00:52:50.078
you are emitting confidence through your spiritual awakening.

00:52:50.103 --> 00:52:52.757
You have those powers.

00:52:52.880 --> 00:52:57.332
You just stand anywhere and you can create peace in that place,

00:52:57.357 --> 00:52:59.979
you can create happiness in that place.

00:53:00.030 --> 00:53:06.384
So be confident, don’t lose your confidence.

00:53:06.535 --> 00:53:13.627
Also your wisdom to understand others will be very much convincing

00:53:13.652 --> 00:53:18.338
for other people to understand that
“They are something exceptional.

00:53:18.417 --> 00:53:21.653
They don’t get angry, they don’t get into temper,

00:53:21.709 --> 00:53:25.553
they are not mad people,
they are not after some sort of a craze -

00:53:25.578 --> 00:53:29.986
just very, very balanced people."

00:53:30.402 --> 00:53:32.775
And this you don’t have to practice.

00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.095
It is there.

00:53:34.134 --> 00:53:37.445
It is within you, and you should be proud of it.

00:53:37.804 --> 00:53:43.144
You should not think that it is something

00:53:43.232 --> 00:53:48.506
that you have to achieve, or to become.

00:53:48.531 --> 00:53:51.254
You have it, within yourself you have it.

00:53:51.279 --> 00:53:56.899
Only thing that you have to see in the light of the Spirit yourself.

00:53:58.287 --> 00:54:03.610
It just is a very simple thing, and that works out.

00:54:04.064 --> 00:54:08.379
It is not easy for others to understand you,

00:54:08.498 --> 00:54:11.570
but it should be very easy to understand them;

00:54:11.595 --> 00:54:14.505
because you were like that before,

00:54:14.530 --> 00:54:21.849
and now they are seeing you and they will become like you.

00:54:22.724 --> 00:54:24.291
It’s very simple.

00:54:24.316 --> 00:54:28.915
You can see this, that I started Sahaja Yoga with one lady.

00:54:28.940 --> 00:54:31.378
And now today, see how many are there.

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:34.819
Now what have I done, I really don’t know, what have I done?

00:54:34.819 --> 00:54:36.891
I have no idea.

00:54:36.924 --> 00:54:41.396
And what you think, such gratitude and enjoyment and joy!

00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:45.046
So all these things, whatever I have told you,

00:54:45.277 --> 00:54:50.818
you have to be aware of your being,  of your own Self,

00:54:50.866 --> 00:54:56.086
of your Spirit, that you are the Spirit.

00:54:56.322 --> 00:55:01.693
And as you are the Spirit, you are beyond all these things.

00:55:01.875 --> 00:55:08.408
And once that happens, you’ll be amazed what a personality you are.

00:55:08.868 --> 00:58:01.679
(Shri Mataji continues in Hindi)
