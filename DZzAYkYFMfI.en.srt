1
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:12,981
Now I will tell you about only one chakra
first of all,

2
00:00:12,981 --> 00:00:19,199
is the yellow chakra you see there called
as Swadishthan which moves around that void.

3
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:34,670
This is the one which is responsible for producing
or manifesting our reflexes but that’s only

4
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:35,950
on the physical side.

5
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:36,950
Now how much work this poor centre has to
do!

6
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:45,010
We have never thought that when we think the
energy we use in our thinking how is it replaced,

7
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,480
thinking energy from where does it come in
our brain.

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,559
We are using our brain all the time but what
is replacing it, is this center.

9
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:01,489
So this center – you know the brain is made
of fats – this center converts the fat of

10
00:01:01,489 --> 00:01:03,230
the stomach for the use of the brain and that’s
how – this is again hypothesis I am telling

11
00:01:03,230 --> 00:01:09,009
you –
that’s how those who think too much go into

12
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:15,420
imbalance, futuristic thinking people planning
everything, plan this, plan that.

13
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:23,409
Most of the plans fail also but they are planning
all the time, thinking too much.

14
00:01:23,409 --> 00:01:33,410
All that leads to one crisis is that person
becomes imbalanced in the sense that this

15
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:42,660
poor centre which has to do other jobs also,
it has to look after your liver, it has to

16
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:50,790
look after your pancreas, it has to look after
your spleen, your kidneys and part of the

17
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:54,240
intestine, large intestine.

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:05,520
So a person who thinks too much, a very right
sided futuristic person first problem can

19
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,520
come from his liver.

20
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,030
In the medical science I don’t think we
have much knowledge about liver.

21
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,130
Liver is by which we live.

22
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:14,849
I think, it’s a very important organ in
the body.

23
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:21,010
So the function of the liver is to absorb
all the poison of the body and convert it

24
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:30,610
into heat and which passes to the blood stream,
is the function in simple words.

25
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,890
I am not using any medical terminology, simple
words.

26
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,569
So now when you start thinking too much you
neglect your liver.

27
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:45,690
When you neglect your liver poor thing doesn’t
know how to do his job.

28
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:51,860
So, the who heat is saturated in the stomach.

29
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,660
The person has heat here then the heat starts
passing upward.

30
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,110
When it passes towards the heart – we call
it right heart,

31
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:06,769
in the medical science there is no right heart
but we have the center and right heart –

32
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:16,310
it creates problem and that problem is called
as asthma, simple words.

33
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:17,790
This heat then also passes to your throat.

34
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:29,370
Also it creates a kind of a cold which always
flows, you sneeze twenty times in the morning

35
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,370
all that sort.

36
00:03:30,370 --> 00:03:33,000
There are two types of colds also, we have
two types: we have one lethargic liver and

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
one over active.

38
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,260
So this is I talked about overactive.

39
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:37,910
Now such a person is overactive.

40
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,780
So he develops this cold, sneezing, this temper,
anger, anxiety, tension.

41
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,700
(Apart: not jot, it’s better hold on, alright.)

42
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,530
Then this heat passes over.

43
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:52,310
It can go to heart at a very young age.

44
00:03:52,310 --> 00:04:03,030
Supposing there are boys who are playing tennis
or something of a rigorous game, and playing

45
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:10,810
it this might affect that then have a massive
heart attack at a very young age which can

46
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:12,780
be fatal.

47
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:18,190
Now the same heat when it passes through the
throat, we develop throat problem and we get

48
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:23,060
a sore throat and all kind of problems we
get.

49
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,950
So, it’s not alright.

50
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:36,110
Now, when it moves down say to your pancreas,
poor pancreas is also suffering because it

51
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:38,320
has no energy from this centre.

52
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,150
So, a simple disease a person like that develops,
is diabetes.

53
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:48,560
Too much of thinking gives diabetes nobody
would think.

54
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,910
They think that too much sugar gives diabetes,
not thinking.

55
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:58,889
In our Maharashtra few have to have a tea
properly, the sugar should be such that the

56
00:04:58,889 --> 00:05:04,289
spoon must stand at right angles otherwise
it is not tea.

57
00:05:04,289 --> 00:05:10,310
And nobody gets diabetes because the villagers
work in the morning, nicely sleeping down

58
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,260
in the night,
not worrying about tomorrow how to do this,

59
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,460
how to do that, nothing.

60
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:17,770
Only the people who are sitting on their seats
and planning, thinking, also worried, get

61
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,770
diabetes.

62
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:19,770
Now diabetes is curable.

63
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:23,840
They say it is inheritance.

64
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:32,270
Also, it is curable by putting this centre
right.

65
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:36,819
Then the third thing I told you is even more
dangerous, is the spleen.

66
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:52,451
Now there is the life, is so funny that it
cannot be congenial to the working of the

67
00:05:52,451 --> 00:05:53,451
spleen.

68
00:05:53,451 --> 00:05:58,699
Spleen works and as you know everybody has
a smoggy morality, that is simple as you know,

69
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:05,620
so it happens that, suppose in the morning
you get up,

70
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:08,190
read the horrible newspaper, “Bombay blast
this, that”,

71
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:12,310
you mean that spleen starts wobbling.

72
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:17,879
Then you don’t eat your food properly or
breakfast properly, just hurry up some or

73
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:24,420
the other, eat something, get into the car
cursing all the people on the way because

74
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:30,300
of the jam, reach the office where there the
boss is on you and absolutely, you’re in

75
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:36,880
a mess there out, and poor this spleen is
wobbling.

76
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,660
She doesn’t understand the craziness of
this man,

77
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,000
“How am I to produce the RBC [Red Blood
Cells]?

78
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,320
Wherever I act?”

79
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,229
This craziness makes it vulnerable to blood
cancer.

80
00:06:47,229 --> 00:06:49,220
So this thing is!

81
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,090
Because she is so crazy she doesn’t understand
how to react.

82
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:58,509
Now what happens that this is supposing I
am saying to you is the spinal cord, that

83
00:06:58,509 --> 00:07:03,030
is, and these are centres, this is the left
side, this is right side.

84
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:09,380
Now they go on working extracting energy from
the centre, it gets exhausted.

85
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:14,310
Suddenly something will happen, some sort
of a shock on the left side because you are

86
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:19,440
working on the right side, so it bends.

87
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,680
When it bends the connection with the whole
is lost and that’s how you become numb.

88
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,530
The main cannot reach anyone so they have
to take over.

89
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:36,240
Now the left side is also a very mysterious
thing which will shock you.

90
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,000
I don’t know if I would be able to speak
today about it.

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,860
That’s quite a mysterious thing in this
left side about which there is no knowledge

92
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:45,659
in the medical science.

93
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:50,550
Now so this trouble of leukemia comes in.

94
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,780
Then it goes to kidneys, you see.

95
00:07:53,780 --> 00:08:01,770
It coagulates your kidneys, you cannot pass
urine, even urinary bladder would be like

96
00:08:01,770 --> 00:08:02,770
this.

97
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,169
Now you get this kidney trouble, you put on
dialysis.

98
00:08:06,169 --> 00:08:10,069
Poor man dies of bankrupt, dies no doubt.

99
00:08:10,069 --> 00:08:12,080
Nobody gets out.

100
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,030
It’s a fact dialysis has not cured anyone
so far, I know.

101
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:24,789
It just makes them live longer and longer
and it’s a fact.

102
00:08:24,789 --> 00:08:26,860
So he dies.

103
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:39,339
Then also it goes down as I told you in the
lower portion.

104
00:08:39,339 --> 00:08:40,339
And sometimes you do not feel hungry because
of the liver, plus you feel constipation.

105
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:45,330
And constipation can be of the worst type
that people get, that all their nights they

106
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,120
end up with minima or some sort of a distress.

107
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:55,640
So these are the common diseases which will
be facing all such people who are overactive.
