00:00:16.701 --> 00:00:19.929
(…) Here you are in such a great position

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.821
that you have got Realization.

00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:35.430
That only thing you have to accept:
the beauty of this great Yoga,

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:45.779
that you just enlighten your own powers,
which are on these seven chakras.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.562
Now let us see the first chakra, belongs
to the power of Gauri,

00:00:52.763 --> 00:00:59.775
the power of the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:06.829
Gauri's power. Tremendous they are,
aren't they?

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.862
Because of Her power you have got
your Realization.

00:01:11.063 --> 00:01:20.896
Now what have we done to enshrine
that power within ourselves?

00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:28.855
Today, if it is the first day of Navaratri,
let us see what have we done?

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:38.531
Have we been able to develop our innocence
within ourselves?

00:01:41.868 --> 00:01:45.095
When people talk, they are so sharp.

00:01:45.296 --> 00:01:48.644
How can you be sharp if you are innocent?

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:54.984
They are so bumptious. How can you be
that if you are innocent?

00:01:55.185 --> 00:02:00.958
People play games. How can you do that
if you are innocent?

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.490
Harm each other. How can it be, if you
are innocent?

00:02:06.691 --> 00:02:09.800
So first of all you have to see yourself,

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:13.486
that the power of innocence, if it has
to live,

00:02:13.687 --> 00:02:18.171
all the rest of the nonsense has to go
away.

00:02:20.521 --> 00:02:23.113
If you want to have the innocence,

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:29.038
all that is anti-innocence has to be
dropped out.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.837
I can understand about people, who are
ignorant, who have ignorance.

00:02:35.038 --> 00:02:39.095
Then in ignorance, of course how will
they talk of innocence?

00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:42.894
But you are not ignorant people. You are
knowledgeable,

00:02:43.095 --> 00:02:45.727
you’ve got your Enlightenment.

00:02:45.928 --> 00:02:49.110
And the power of innocence is so great.

00:02:49.311 --> 00:02:53.811
It makes you absolutely fearless, not
bumptious but fearless.

00:02:54.012 --> 00:02:59.497
And the greatest thing of innocence
is that you are respectful.

00:03:00.835 --> 00:03:07.268
The sense of respect, if it is not
developed within you,

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:12.936
if you cannot develop the sense of respect
for other Sahaja Yogis,

00:03:13.137 --> 00:03:21.144
for other people, for the Ashrams, for
the discipline and your own Self-respect,

00:03:21.345 --> 00:03:26.220
then it is of no use, even talking
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:30.686
because that is the very beginning of it.

00:03:30.887 --> 00:03:32.892
First you do not respect, all right,

00:03:33.093 --> 00:03:34.811
you are bumptious, all right,

00:03:35.012 --> 00:03:41.069
you are in a big fool's paradise, as they
call it,

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.290
riding a fast horse, all that is there is
all right, is forgiven.

00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:52.264
But once you have seen the light, you
must try

00:03:52.465 --> 00:03:59.708
to get rid of all the snakes that you have
been holding on to -

00:04:02.532 --> 00:04:05.750
is a simple thing.

00:04:05.951 --> 00:04:09.936
In your childlike nature only,

00:04:10.137 --> 00:04:14.103
you can receive the blessings of Gauri,
otherwise you cannot.

00:04:14.304 --> 00:04:16.990
You have to be really childlike,

00:04:17.191 --> 00:04:23.011
otherwise it is absolutely useless, no use
telling you anything,

00:04:23.212 --> 00:04:25.410
because you think you’re too clever.

00:04:25.626 --> 00:04:27.941
To such a person, who thinks he is
too clever,

00:04:28.142 --> 00:04:33.235
what's the use of talking to such a person,
because he already knows everything.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.186
So the first power when you develop,

00:04:36.387 --> 00:04:41.580
you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth,
first of all.

00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:43.811
You must respect the Mother Earth,

00:04:44.012 --> 00:04:47.662
because the first chakra is made out
of the Mother Earth.

00:04:47.863 --> 00:04:53.926
Try to be more settled down with yourself
on Mother Earth.

00:04:55.243 --> 00:05:02.852
And the respect. See the trees when
they get their flowers,

00:05:03.053 --> 00:05:08.269
they are not so respectful, but when they
are laden by the fruits,

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.376
they bow down to Mother Earth.

00:05:14.012 --> 00:05:19.753
In the same way when you have got
the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

00:05:19.954 --> 00:05:23.609
you all must bow down.

00:05:26.232 --> 00:05:30.488
And innocence has a special capacity

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:38.103
to make a person extremely peaceful,
extremely peaceful.

00:05:38.304 --> 00:05:43.936
All the anger, temper, violence.

00:05:44.137 --> 00:05:52.923
If a person doesn’t have innocence,
it cannot come in it,

00:05:53.124 --> 00:06:02.452
because a person who is not innocent
is either sly or aggressive.

00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:05.858
He cannot have peace within his heart.

00:06:06.059 --> 00:06:09.268
But a innocent person is not bothered,
innocently he lives,

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:15.678
he enjoys everything in complete peace
and harmony.

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:25.936
But this violence comes when a person
becomes clever.

00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:29.470
He thinks, “I am so clever, the another one
is so stupid,

00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:33.588
I have a right to shout at that person.”

00:06:34.095 --> 00:06:39.686
And the one who is not innocent is never
wise.

00:06:39.887 --> 00:06:43.268
He may be, to look at, look sharp, but
he is not wise.

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:47.686
Wisdom comes only with innocence.

00:06:47.894 --> 00:06:52.424
And how much wisdom have you gathered?

00:06:55.184 --> 00:06:57.444
That is what one has to see.

00:06:57.645 --> 00:07:06.542
When your power of innocence increases,
wisdom is apparent.

00:07:06.743 --> 00:07:10.442
People say, “That fellow is very wise.”

00:07:10.643 --> 00:07:14.435
For example if somebody is crying about
his wife,

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:20.319
a wise person will say, “Oh Baba! just
look at this, still busy with his wife.”

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:22.631
Another one is crying about his house
or something.

00:07:22.832 --> 00:07:28.394
He will say, “Oh! look at this one still
busy with the house.”

00:07:28.638 --> 00:07:32.204
There is no end to it.

00:07:34.195 --> 00:07:42.294
I’ve known people who get so swollen up

00:07:42.495 --> 00:07:48.560
that they think they must give a big
lecture for one hour, on Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:48.761 --> 00:07:52.186
Unless and until, they have given
one-hour lecture,

00:07:52.387 --> 00:07:57.659
they do not think their ego has manifested
itself fully.

00:07:57.860 --> 00:08:06.186
But a wise person, he doesn't have to talk
or speak or do anything.

00:08:06.387 --> 00:08:10.974
He impresses his silence, his wisdom

00:08:11.175 --> 00:08:16.948
on others much more easily. And that is
what we have to see.

00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:20.715
Have we been able to discipline ourselves?

00:08:20.916 --> 00:08:25.268
Because our growth is very much
in the beginning of it.

00:08:25.469 --> 00:08:32.339
We have to grow quite a lot. And people
don’t understand this point

00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:37.352
in an atmosphere of egoistical temperament

00:08:37.553 --> 00:08:42.413
that you have to grow, you have not
yet grown.

00:08:42.614 --> 00:08:46.379
You have to grow a lot.

00:08:46.899 --> 00:08:50.770
And when you grow you find this wisdom

00:08:50.971 --> 00:08:55.348
really fragrant with compassion.

00:08:55.549 --> 00:09:00.837
Your wisdom is fragrant with compassion.

00:09:01.232 --> 00:09:09.310
Such beautiful compassion can emit
through your being,

00:09:09.511 --> 00:09:16.720
that anybody who comes in contact with
you, will feel your auspiciousness.

00:09:17.754 --> 00:09:23.582
But, again you must

00:09:23.783 --> 00:09:28.251
give due respect to your Self Realization
and to your Self.

00:09:28.469 --> 00:09:32.000
That is the first thing you have to do,
is to meditate.

00:09:32.735 --> 00:09:37.104
(…) We are not drinking, we do not have
hangovers,

00:09:37.305 --> 00:09:40.641
we don’t sleep late,

00:09:40.842 --> 00:09:43.755
so why shouldn’t we decide today that,

00:09:43.956 --> 00:09:48.411
“Every morning I’ll get up and do
my meditation.

00:09:48.612 --> 00:09:55.153
And while meditating I must concentrate
on myself and not on others.

00:09:55.354 --> 00:09:58.006
And see for myself what is catching,
where am I catching,

00:09:58.207 --> 00:10:01.904
which chakra I am catching, what have I
to do?”

00:10:02.105 --> 00:10:07.860
So on this day of Navaratri, today
as the first day,

00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:14.543
the Gauri's power must be enlightened
within us, and they must express.

00:10:14.744 --> 00:10:20.868
And they are tremendous. I cannot
describe them in one lecture.

00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:24.820
Think of the Primordial Kundalini.

00:10:25.021 --> 00:10:29.103
She acts in the Mother Earth, She acts
in the universe,

00:10:29.304 --> 00:10:35.161
She acts in the animals, She acts
in the matter,

00:10:35.362 --> 00:10:42.079
She acts in the human beings, and now
She acts in you.

00:10:44.710 --> 00:10:51.868
She is the One who decides the face and
the figure that you are going to have.

00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:55.737
She is the One who decides what child
you should have.

00:10:55.938 --> 00:11:02.070
She is the One who gives you the particular
type of a child that you need.

00:11:02.271 --> 00:11:06.987
She is the One who has got you all these
beautiful children.

00:11:07.188 --> 00:11:12.703
She is the One who has given you these
sparkling faces and sparkling eyes.

00:11:12.904 --> 00:11:15.859
All this She has done for you,

00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:20.695
but what about the power that you have
within yourself?

00:11:20.896 --> 00:11:23.610
How much have you manifested that?

00:11:24.148 --> 00:11:29.667
(…) So try to understand that it is you
who has to grow,

00:11:29.876 --> 00:11:34.132
it is you who has to manifest these powers.

00:11:34.333 --> 00:11:40.426
Manifestation of the powers, I don’t know
how far you have understood.

00:11:40.627 --> 00:11:43.712
When a person who has Gauri’s power,

00:11:43.913 --> 00:11:46.628
as soon as he enters a hall or any place,

00:11:46.829 --> 00:11:52.049
everybody’s Kundalini rises, just
to salute.

00:12:00.513 --> 00:12:04.585
When you have Gauri's power then
you stand out

00:12:04.786 --> 00:12:14.503
because you have that innocent, lustless,
greedless, beautiful, sparkling eyes

00:12:14.704 --> 00:12:18.658
and wherever you turn your eyes, even
one glance

00:12:18.859 --> 00:12:22.708
would raise the Kundalini immediately.

00:12:23.815 --> 00:12:27.259
People who suffer from cancer, suffer
from this disease, that disease,

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:34.435
all can be cured in no time if you have
developed only one power of Gauri.

00:12:38.335 --> 00:12:41.782
All your problems can be solved.

00:12:41.983 --> 00:12:49.713
Negativity will go away and you will
become like a lotus.

00:12:50.532 --> 00:12:59.627
Beautiful, fragrant, overpowering
all kinds of negativity.

00:12:59.793 --> 00:13:09.051
Here it is, “That fellow just touched me
and now I have become egoistical.”

00:13:09.252 --> 00:13:11.842
If there is one fellow who is egoistical,

00:13:12.043 --> 00:13:15.259
he just talks to another person, the person
goes egoistical.

00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.001
I mean this is not the way to be sensitive.

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:22.889
You have to be sensitive to God and not
to bad things.

00:13:23.090 --> 00:13:27.891
But we are more akin, more vulnerable

00:13:28.092 --> 00:13:31.384
to bad than to good.

00:13:32.402 --> 00:13:37.730
So the power, the power of assimilation
of good,

00:13:37.931 --> 00:13:42.687
the power of emission of good,

00:13:42.888 --> 00:13:49.538
all these powers are just in your complete
reach.

00:13:50.350 --> 00:13:55.468
But all this should not become a praise

00:13:55.669 --> 00:14:03.884
but should become a kind of a challenge,
a kind of a beautiful curiosity

00:14:04.085 --> 00:14:07.675
and an advancement for you.

00:14:08.993 --> 00:14:12.551
(…) That is why My humble request is

00:14:12.752 --> 00:14:19.552
that you must learn to worship discipline.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:24.274
I don’t say, “Do this, do that,” you know
what is to be done.

00:14:24.475 --> 00:14:29.646
And then on top of that, you should not
tell Me, “I know, I should have, I know.”

00:14:29.847 --> 00:14:34.812
When you know, why don't you do it?
You are empowered.

00:14:35.013 --> 00:14:41.541
Today let us, with full confidence
in ourselves and in our ascent,

00:14:41.742 --> 00:14:45.312
let us with full intensity attend this Puja

00:14:45.513 --> 00:14:51.666
and in our hearts decide that, “I am going
to discipline myself.”

00:14:55.295 --> 00:14:57.664
May God bless you all.
