00:16.701 --> 00:19.929
(…) Here you are in such a great position

00:20.130 --> 00:23.821
that you have got Realization.

00:24.022 --> 00:35.430
That only thing you have to accept:
the beauty of this great Yoga,

00:35.631 --> 00:45.779
that you just enlighten your own powers,
which are on these seven chakras.

00:45.980 --> 00:52.562
Now let us see the first chakra, belongs
to the power of Gauri,

00:52.763 --> 00:59.775
the power of the Mother of Shri Ganesh.

01:02.536 --> 01:06.829
Gauri's power. Tremendous they are,
aren't they?

01:07.030 --> 01:10.862
Because of Her power you have got
your Realization.

01:11.063 --> 01:20.896
Now what have we done to enshrine
that power within ourselves?

01:21.245 --> 01:28.855
Today, if it is the first day of Navaratri,
let us see what have we done?

01:31.256 --> 01:38.531
Have we been able to develop our innocence
within ourselves?

01:41.868 --> 01:45.095
When people talk, they are so sharp.

01:45.296 --> 01:48.644
How can you be sharp if you are innocent?

01:48.845 --> 01:54.984
They are so bumptious. How can you be
that if you are innocent?

01:55.185 --> 02:00.958
People play games. How can you do that
if you are innocent?

02:01.159 --> 02:06.490
Harm each other. How can it be, if you
are innocent?

02:06.691 --> 02:09.800
So first of all you have to see yourself,

02:10.001 --> 02:13.486
that the power of innocence, if it has
to live,

02:13.687 --> 02:18.171
all the rest of the nonsense has to go
away.

02:20.521 --> 02:23.113
If you want to have the innocence,

02:23.314 --> 02:29.038
all that is anti-innocence has to be
dropped out.

02:29.980 --> 02:34.837
I can understand about people, who are
ignorant, who have ignorance.

02:35.038 --> 02:39.095
Then in ignorance, of course how will
they talk of innocence?

02:39.286 --> 02:42.894
But you are not ignorant people. You are
knowledgeable,

02:43.095 --> 02:45.727
you’ve got your Enlightenment.

02:45.928 --> 02:49.110
And the power of innocence is so great.

02:49.311 --> 02:53.811
It makes you absolutely fearless, not
bumptious but fearless.

02:54.012 --> 02:59.497
And the greatest thing of innocence
is that you are respectful.

03:00.835 --> 03:07.268
The sense of respect, if it is not
developed within you,

03:07.469 --> 03:12.936
if you cannot develop the sense of respect
for other Sahaja Yogis,

03:13.137 --> 03:21.144
for other people, for the Ashrams, for
the discipline and your own Self-respect,

03:21.345 --> 03:26.220
then it is of no use, even talking
of Sahaja Yoga,

03:26.421 --> 03:30.686
because that is the very beginning of it.

03:30.887 --> 03:32.892
First you do not respect, all right,

03:33.093 --> 03:34.811
you are bumptious, all right,

03:35.012 --> 03:41.069
you are in a big fool's paradise, as they
call it,

03:41.270 --> 03:47.290
riding a fast horse, all that is there is
all right, is forgiven.

03:47.491 --> 03:52.264
But once you have seen the light, you
must try

03:52.465 --> 03:59.708
to get rid of all the snakes that you have
been holding on to -

04:02.532 --> 04:05.750
is a simple thing.

04:05.951 --> 04:09.936
In your childlike nature only,

04:10.137 --> 04:14.103
you can receive the blessings of Gauri,
otherwise you cannot.

04:14.304 --> 04:16.990
You have to be really childlike,

04:17.191 --> 04:23.011
otherwise it is absolutely useless, no use
telling you anything,

04:23.212 --> 04:25.410
because you think you’re too clever.

04:25.626 --> 04:27.941
To such a person, who thinks he is
too clever,

04:28.142 --> 04:33.235
what's the use of talking to such a person,
because he already knows everything.

04:33.660 --> 04:36.186
So the first power when you develop,

04:36.387 --> 04:41.580
you must learn to sit on the Mother Earth,
first of all.

04:41.781 --> 04:43.811
You must respect the Mother Earth,

04:44.012 --> 04:47.662
because the first chakra is made out
of the Mother Earth.

04:47.863 --> 04:53.926
Try to be more settled down with yourself
on Mother Earth.

04:55.243 --> 05:02.852
And the respect. See the trees when
they get their flowers,

05:03.053 --> 05:08.269
they are not so respectful, but when they
are laden by the fruits,

05:08.470 --> 05:13.376
they bow down to Mother Earth.

05:14.012 --> 05:19.753
In the same way when you have got
the fruits of Sahaja Yoga,

05:19.954 --> 05:23.609
you all must bow down.

05:26.232 --> 05:30.488
And innocence has a special capacity

05:30.689 --> 05:38.103
to make a person extremely peaceful,
extremely peaceful.

05:38.304 --> 05:43.936
All the anger, temper, violence.

05:44.137 --> 05:52.923
If a person doesn’t have innocence,
it cannot come in it,

05:53.124 --> 06:02.452
because a person who is not innocent
is either sly or aggressive.

06:03.137 --> 06:05.858
He cannot have peace within his heart.

06:06.059 --> 06:09.268
But a innocent person is not bothered,
innocently he lives,

06:09.469 --> 06:15.678
he enjoys everything in complete peace
and harmony.

06:17.779 --> 06:25.936
But this violence comes when a person
becomes clever.

06:26.137 --> 06:29.470
He thinks, “I am so clever, the another one
is so stupid,

06:29.671 --> 06:33.588
I have a right to shout at that person.”

06:34.095 --> 06:39.686
And the one who is not innocent is never
wise.

06:39.887 --> 06:43.268
He may be, to look at, look sharp, but
he is not wise.

06:43.469 --> 06:47.686
Wisdom comes only with innocence.

06:47.894 --> 06:52.424
And how much wisdom have you gathered?

06:55.184 --> 06:57.444
That is what one has to see.

06:57.645 --> 07:06.542
When your power of innocence increases,
wisdom is apparent.

07:06.743 --> 07:10.442
People say, “That fellow is very wise.”

07:10.643 --> 07:14.435
For example if somebody is crying about
his wife,

07:14.636 --> 07:20.319
a wise person will say, “Oh Baba! just
look at this, still busy with his wife.”

07:20.520 --> 07:22.631
Another one is crying about his house
or something.

07:22.832 --> 07:28.394
He will say, “Oh! look at this one still
busy with the house.”

07:28.638 --> 07:32.204
There is no end to it.

07:34.195 --> 07:42.294
I’ve known people who get so swollen up

07:42.495 --> 07:48.560
that they think they must give a big
lecture for one hour, on Sahaja Yoga.

07:48.761 --> 07:52.186
Unless and until, they have given
one-hour lecture,

07:52.387 --> 07:57.659
they do not think their ego has manifested
itself fully.

07:57.860 --> 08:06.186
But a wise person, he doesn't have to talk
or speak or do anything.

08:06.387 --> 08:10.974
He impresses his silence, his wisdom

08:11.175 --> 08:16.948
on others much more easily. And that is
what we have to see.

08:17.149 --> 08:20.715
Have we been able to discipline ourselves?

08:20.916 --> 08:25.268
Because our growth is very much
in the beginning of it.

08:25.469 --> 08:32.339
We have to grow quite a lot. And people
don’t understand this point

08:32.540 --> 08:37.352
in an atmosphere of egoistical temperament

08:37.553 --> 08:42.413
that you have to grow, you have not
yet grown.

08:42.614 --> 08:46.379
You have to grow a lot.

08:46.899 --> 08:50.770
And when you grow you find this wisdom

08:50.971 --> 08:55.348
really fragrant with compassion.

08:55.549 --> 09:00.837
Your wisdom is fragrant with compassion.

09:01.232 --> 09:09.310
Such beautiful compassion can emit
through your being,

09:09.511 --> 09:16.720
that anybody who comes in contact with
you, will feel your auspiciousness.

09:17.754 --> 09:23.582
But, again you must

09:23.783 --> 09:28.251
give due respect to your Self Realization
and to your Self.

09:28.469 --> 09:32.000
That is the first thing you have to do,
is to meditate.

09:32.735 --> 09:37.104
(…) We are not drinking, we do not have
hangovers,

09:37.305 --> 09:40.641
we don’t sleep late,

09:40.842 --> 09:43.755
so why shouldn’t we decide today that,

09:43.956 --> 09:48.411
“Every morning I’ll get up and do
my meditation.

09:48.612 --> 09:55.153
And while meditating I must concentrate
on myself and not on others.

09:55.354 --> 09:58.006
And see for myself what is catching,
where am I catching,

09:58.207 --> 10:01.904
which chakra I am catching, what have I
to do?”

10:02.105 --> 10:07.860
So on this day of Navaratri, today
as the first day,

10:08.069 --> 10:14.543
the Gauri's power must be enlightened
within us, and they must express.

10:14.744 --> 10:20.868
And they are tremendous. I cannot
describe them in one lecture.

10:21.069 --> 10:24.820
Think of the Primordial Kundalini.

10:25.021 --> 10:29.103
She acts in the Mother Earth, She acts
in the universe,

10:29.304 --> 10:35.161
She acts in the animals, She acts
in the matter,

10:35.362 --> 10:42.079
She acts in the human beings, and now
She acts in you.

10:44.710 --> 10:51.868
She is the One who decides the face and
the figure that you are going to have.

10:52.069 --> 10:55.737
She is the One who decides what child
you should have.

10:55.938 --> 11:02.070
She is the One who gives you the particular
type of a child that you need.

11:02.271 --> 11:06.987
She is the One who has got you all these
beautiful children.

11:07.188 --> 11:12.703
She is the One who has given you these
sparkling faces and sparkling eyes.

11:12.904 --> 11:15.859
All this She has done for you,

11:16.060 --> 11:20.695
but what about the power that you have
within yourself?

11:20.896 --> 11:23.610
How much have you manifested that?

11:24.148 --> 11:29.667
(…) So try to understand that it is you
who has to grow,

11:29.876 --> 11:34.132
it is you who has to manifest these powers.

11:34.333 --> 11:40.426
Manifestation of the powers, I don’t know
how far you have understood.

11:40.627 --> 11:43.712
When a person who has Gauri’s power,

11:43.913 --> 11:46.628
as soon as he enters a hall or any place,

11:46.829 --> 11:52.049
everybody’s Kundalini rises, just
to salute.

12:00.513 --> 12:04.585
When you have Gauri's power then
you stand out

12:04.786 --> 12:14.503
because you have that innocent, lustless,
greedless, beautiful, sparkling eyes

12:14.704 --> 12:18.658
and wherever you turn your eyes, even
one glance

12:18.859 --> 12:22.708
would raise the Kundalini immediately.

12:23.815 --> 12:27.259
People who suffer from cancer, suffer
from this disease, that disease,

12:27.460 --> 12:34.435
all can be cured in no time if you have
developed only one power of Gauri.

12:38.335 --> 12:41.782
All your problems can be solved.

12:41.983 --> 12:49.713
Negativity will go away and you will
become like a lotus.

12:50.532 --> 12:59.627
Beautiful, fragrant, overpowering
all kinds of negativity.

12:59.793 --> 13:09.051
Here it is, “That fellow just touched me
and now I have become egoistical.”

13:09.252 --> 13:11.842
If there is one fellow who is egoistical,

13:12.043 --> 13:15.259
he just talks to another person, the person
goes egoistical.

13:15.460 --> 13:18.001
I mean this is not the way to be sensitive.

13:18.210 --> 13:22.889
You have to be sensitive to God and not
to bad things.

13:23.090 --> 13:27.891
But we are more akin, more vulnerable

13:28.092 --> 13:31.384
to bad than to good.

13:32.402 --> 13:37.730
So the power, the power of assimilation
of good,

13:37.931 --> 13:42.687
the power of emission of good,

13:42.888 --> 13:49.538
all these powers are just in your complete
reach.

13:50.350 --> 13:55.468
But all this should not become a praise

13:55.669 --> 14:03.884
but should become a kind of a challenge,
a kind of a beautiful curiosity

14:04.085 --> 14:07.675
and an advancement for you.

14:08.993 --> 14:12.551
(…) That is why My humble request is

14:12.752 --> 14:19.552
that you must learn to worship discipline.

14:19.770 --> 14:24.274
I don’t say, “Do this, do that,” you know
what is to be done.

14:24.475 --> 14:29.646
And then on top of that, you should not
tell Me, “I know, I should have, I know.”

14:29.847 --> 14:34.812
When you know, why don't you do it?
You are empowered.

14:35.013 --> 14:41.541
Today let us, with full confidence
in ourselves and in our ascent,

14:41.742 --> 14:45.312
let us with full intensity attend this Puja

14:45.513 --> 14:51.666
and in our hearts decide that, “I am going
to discipline myself.”

14:55.295 --> 14:57.664
May God bless you all.
