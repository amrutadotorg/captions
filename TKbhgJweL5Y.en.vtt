First of all, the Sahaja Yoga
must be worked out on yourself.

00:13.120 --> 00:18.504
The one who doesn’t feel happy in Sahaja Yoga
must know that there’s something wrong.

00:18.624 --> 00:20.958
You have to feel joyous and happy.

00:21.038 --> 00:24.175
If you don’t feel happy, if you cannot laugh out,

00:24.255 --> 00:27.037
then there’s something wrong with you

00:27.117 --> 00:29.343
and that should be corrected.

00:29.423 --> 00:33.264
First sign of a Sahaja Yogi,
that he has glow on his face

00:33.344 --> 00:37.654
and that he is always joyous and happy.

00:37.907 --> 00:40.826
So, this is one point we have to remember,

00:40.906 --> 00:44.140
that we have to be joyous people, happy people.

00:44.220 --> 00:47.426
At the same time we should be responsible.

00:47.506 --> 00:51.430
For example, what I always hear from the leaders

00:51.510 --> 00:55.835
that there are five per cent people who take up responsibilities

00:55.915 --> 01:00.638
and all the rest are just there doing nothing.

01:01.358 --> 01:04.068
Now it has increased, five to ten per cent has come,

01:04.148 --> 01:06.081
now it is coming to twenty per cent,

01:06.161 --> 01:11.208
but all of you should, because that’s the only way you can ascend,

01:11.288 --> 01:15.705
not by just enjoyment, by calling it a Leela and all that,

01:15.785 --> 01:21.441
but by really working out Sahaja Yoga
upon yourself and upon other people.

01:21.521 --> 01:27.015
So, we have to work out first of all upon ourselves
to find out what’s wrong with us.

01:27.095 --> 01:31.693
There has to be a soul search
and many people just put a big curtain on it

01:31.773 --> 01:33.995
and just don’t want to see, it’s all right.

01:34.075 --> 01:36.958
Of course, I don’t say you write to me
long letters of confessions,

01:37.038 --> 01:39.575
it doesn’t mean that, but you see for yourself,

01:39.655 --> 01:41.324
“Why? Why am I doing that?

01:41.404 --> 01:43.042
What was the need for me to do that?

01:43.123 --> 01:45.502
Why didn’t I take it up like that?”
