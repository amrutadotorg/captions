00:00:05.973 --> 00:00:10.411
So there should be no more silence.
There should be no more silence.

00:00:10.491 --> 00:00:14.233
Public opinion is a very, very big thing in the modern times.

00:00:14.313 --> 00:00:19.175
That’s a very, very big thing you
have got and silence is to be abhorred.

00:00:19.255 --> 00:00:24.195
Absolutely. Because people who are
doing wrong have a conspiracy of silence.

00:00:24.275 --> 00:00:27.580
They conspire, and then they
keep silent: “All right, doesn’t matter.”

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.903
Democracy, as far as Chile is concerned, all right.

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:34.202
But as far as Argentina is concerned will be this way.

00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:39.605
It’s like that. You see, they keep a silent mouth.

00:00:39.685 --> 00:00:42.580
Whatever is not bad for us is good, that’s how.

00:00:42.661 --> 00:00:45.131
And then, “don’t say anything, don’t say anything.”

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:49.960
Sahaja Yogis have to be extremely bold and extremely outspoken

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.385
and they have to say that this is
all wrong, absurd. It is not for us.

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:59.800
Not that they are uncomfortable,
but it’s are against life, against Christ,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.891
against our emancipation, and this has to be given up.

00:01:03.971 --> 00:01:08.848
And today you must vow that now as your house is settled down,

00:01:08.928 --> 00:01:14.233
your backbone is strengthened, you have to take a vow

00:01:14.313 --> 00:01:16.170
that you will stand for Christ.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.902
And for His great morals, and for the
great things He said, that we have to be.

00:01:20.982 --> 00:01:24.814
And we have to tell people, “What are
you doing? This is wrong. You cannot do it.”

00:01:24.894 --> 00:01:30.122
They are more vocal when it comes
to something degrading, like drinking.

00:01:30.203 --> 00:01:34.365
If you don’t drink they’ll say, “Why don’t you
drink?” They will force you. “Why don’t you drink?

00:01:34.445 --> 00:01:36.115
You must drink, you must have this.”

00:01:36.195 --> 00:01:41.203
But when it comes to morality, nobody dares
anything. We don’t discuss religion, very good.

00:01:41.283 --> 00:01:43.400
This is the silent conspiracy.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.480
We don’t discuss religion, because
if we discuss we are not religious.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.640
So people have to speak about it. All of you have to speak.

00:01:50.721 --> 00:01:53.098
Then only your left Vishuddhi will be all right.

00:01:53.178 --> 00:01:56.393
Now the only guilt that will be working in the Sahaja Yogis

00:01:56.473 --> 00:01:59.913
will be that for Sahaja Yoga we are not doing anything.

00:01:59.993 --> 00:02:03.309
You must speak. You must talk about it.

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.548
You must give realization. Move your hands, move your legs.

00:02:06.628 --> 00:02:11.003
You have to walk across for God’s work,
even if you have to beg you have to do that.

00:02:11.083 --> 00:02:12.518
This is God’s work.

00:02:12.598 --> 00:02:17.996
And one has to do that, God’s work,
with all dedication, with all surrendering

00:02:18.076 --> 00:02:21.048
and with all love and enjoyment.

00:02:21.128 --> 00:02:23.410
So, may God bless you all.
