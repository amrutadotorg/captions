1
00:09:57,667 --> 00:10:03,648
It's a very great day for Me to 
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

2
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:10,899
who are from this 
country, Greece.

3
00:10:12,643 --> 00:10:16,218
When first I came 
to Greece,

4
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,174
I told My husband that this 
country is full of vibrations

5
00:10:21,455 --> 00:10:27,061
and there have been many 
evolved souls in this country

6
00:10:27,574 --> 00:10:31,088
but perhaps the people 
have lost their heritage,

7
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:34,507
but the vibrations are 
in the atmosphere

8
00:10:34,957 --> 00:10:39,790
and one day Sahaja Yoga 
should prosper here very much.

9
00:10:40,584 --> 00:10:48,291
And somehow, we met some 
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

10
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:53,165
the experience was not good with 
them and My husband said

11
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:57,266
that, "If you said that Greeks 
are really religious people,

12
00:10:57,527 --> 00:11:00,483
then look at these people 
- what are they doing to me?"

13
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:04,327
I said, "They may be bureaucrats 
and all over, bureaucrats,

14
00:11:04,596 --> 00:11:06,717
you can't say what sort 
of people they could be."

15
00:11:06,964 --> 00:11:13,282
But, on the whole, the vibrations 
were very, very good, no doubt,

16
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:19,480
and I went to all the places 
in here, like I went to Delphi,

17
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:23,649
I went up there to see Athena's 
temple and everything.

18
00:11:23,986 --> 00:11:29,579
To all the places of interest, 
they took Me round, especially Me,

19
00:11:32,235 --> 00:11:35,385
because he was busy 
with his conference,

20
00:11:35,659 --> 00:11:39,553
and so they took Me round. 
And everywhere I felt

21
00:11:39,853 --> 00:11:44,372
even the sea I felt was 
so beautiful. This was about,

22
00:11:44,665 --> 00:11:49,598
I think I came here at least 
about fifteen years back,

23
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:55,167
maybe fourteen years 
back - and I find now

24
00:11:56,211 --> 00:11:59,672
the vibrations are coming 
back now through you people

25
00:12:00,097 --> 00:12:03,378
and the whole place 
is again vibrating.

26
00:12:03,665 --> 00:12:05,489
Now, you have to understand 
that you people

27
00:12:05,821 --> 00:12:09,089
have a very big responsibility 
because you're

28
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,570
strategically placed 
in Greece, you see.

29
00:12:13,882 --> 00:12:19,720
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey, 
both are very important.

30
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:24,511
First of all, you are the bridge 
between the eastern side

31
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:29,686
and the western side and 
everybody is interested in,

32
00:12:30,061 --> 00:12:33,333
somehow or another, 
managing these two areas

33
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:38,946
so that hey could control 
eastern and western side.

34
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:44,365
I mean the western 
countries especially.

35
00:12:44,633 --> 00:12:47,252
Now the greatest danger 
that you have now

36
00:12:47,534 --> 00:12:51,715
is that this western culture 
may try to grab you

37
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,175
and which is very 
dangerous.

38
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,638
To understand it, 
you have to know

39
00:12:59,944 --> 00:13:03,738
that you are people coming 
from a very great tradition,

40
00:13:04,082 --> 00:13:08,427
ancient people of ages 
just like Indians,

41
00:13:09,159 --> 00:13:15,720
and there is so much you can do 
to improve the culture of Europe

42
00:13:16,063 --> 00:13:19,001
by your own behavior.

43
00:13:19,289 --> 00:13:23,568
Like these people we have 
coming here, tourists are coming,

44
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:30,168
and they see the 
behavior of the Greeks

45
00:13:30,718 --> 00:13:36,017
and they see that they 
can influence very well,

46
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:43,849
the Europeans, think that Greeks 
can be very easily influenced

47
00:13:44,093 --> 00:13:48,061
by their culture, 
by their cheap life.

48
00:13:48,798 --> 00:13:53,648
So, as you being the 
such traditional people,

49
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:59,217
down to earth and 
so many, so many

50
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:04,365
good things you 
have known in life,

51
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:08,878
it's very important to 
understand the historical

52
00:14:09,185 --> 00:14:11,768
background of your country, 
first of all.

53
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:17,129
For Sahaja Yogis it is very 
important to be educated that way

54
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:20,279
because tomorrow you'll have 
to talk to other people

55
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,748
and you'll have to tell them 
about Athena, about your traditions,

56
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,686
about your background and how 
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

57
00:14:30,973 --> 00:14:35,153
connected to Mother Mary, connected 
to Christ and all those things.

58
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,564
For this, it is very necessary that 
we all should try to understand

59
00:14:40,864 --> 00:14:43,594
the historical background 
of this country

60
00:14:44,154 --> 00:14:50,085
and educate yourself in a way that 
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

61
00:14:50,847 --> 00:14:54,165
As it is, you know, Athena has 
the Kundalini in Her hand

62
00:14:54,497 --> 00:14:59,161
and you can see that clearly 
that She was the Adi Shakti.

63
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:03,165
Actually, in Sanskrit language 
atha means primordial.

64
00:15:03,434 --> 00:15:05,965
So She was 
the Primordial Mother.

65
00:15:06,514 --> 00:15:07,918
Because there was 
no connection

66
00:15:08,187 --> 00:15:10,849
left between the Greeks 
and the Indians,

67
00:15:11,126 --> 00:15:14,495
this, I mean, translation

68
00:15:14,782 --> 00:15:19,489
was not there and they didn't 
know what it meant by Athena.

69
00:15:20,563 --> 00:15:23,819
But Indians know that it 
is this is the place

70
00:15:24,125 --> 00:15:29,717
for the manifestation 
of the Adi Shakti

71
00:15:30,118 --> 00:15:34,683
because in the Devi Mahatmyam, 
if you read, or you will find out

72
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:38,648
they have described Greece 
as the Manipurndwip.

73
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:45,523
Means the island in the Manipur. 
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

74
00:15:45,873 --> 00:15:52,497
So in the Nabhi there's an 
island where it is your Greece,

75
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:57,125
where the Goddess resides. 
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

76
00:15:58,414 --> 00:16:02,551
And so, this Athena has 
been described,

77
00:16:02,789 --> 00:16:06,902
and when I went to Her 
temple I found that there was

78
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:13,274
a little temple for the child God. 
That was Shri Ganesha.

79
00:16:13,552 --> 00:16:17,014
And then, when I went to Delphi, 
also, when I went there

80
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:20,321
I was surprised to see, they showed 
Me a mound and said,

81
00:16:20,608 --> 00:16:24,252
"This is the Nabhi, navel 
of the whole universe."

82
00:16:24,515 --> 00:16:27,502
I said, "That's correct." But when 
I turned round there

83
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:32,182
were lots of vibrations and what 
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

84
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:35,039
Then Gregoire came here 
he took photographs

85
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,439
and everything 
and he saw that.

86
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:41,221
So now you are the Nabhi. 
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

87
00:16:41,496 --> 00:16:44,558
of the whole universe. 
So how important is Nabhi?

88
00:16:44,877 --> 00:16:49,613
You know that very well, 
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

89
00:16:49,881 --> 00:16:53,800
the whole life becomes 
miserable for a human being.

90
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:57,600
So, on the right side of 
the Nabhi, as you see,

91
00:16:58,425 --> 00:17:04,900
is the liver and because, of course, 
we had lots of philosophers,

92
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:09,824
they used to think a lot and 
they created lots of tragedies,

93
00:17:10,093 --> 00:17:13,990
you see Greek tragedy's well 
known, where a marriage system was

94
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:19,365
little bit challenged, that 
there was, say, two men,

95
00:17:19,658 --> 00:17:23,053
one woman or maybe 
two women, one man

96
00:17:23,316 --> 00:17:26,535
and never they felt happy 
with the marriage.

97
00:17:26,841 --> 00:17:30,751
So the left Nabhi was 
under attack, throughout.

98
00:17:31,045 --> 00:17:36,048
To have such a tragedy, they 
wrote so many, I would say,

99
00:17:36,373 --> 00:17:41,880
so many dramas and they played them 
here and so many plays were there

100
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,199
showing that there are two 
men and one woman

101
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:49,506
or two women and one 
man and no relationship

102
00:17:49,811 --> 00:17:53,066
between the husband 
and wife which was pure.

103
00:17:53,349 --> 00:17:54,702
And that was the tragedy.

104
00:17:54,964 --> 00:17:57,939
It's known all over 
as the Greek tragedy.

105
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,633
It's all imaginary 
and people, you see,

106
00:18:00,908 --> 00:18:04,139
became very left-sided to 
begin with. They started thinking,

107
00:18:04,395 --> 00:18:07,615
Oh, this life is a misery. 
It's a tragedy.

108
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:11,396
What should we do? 
Why should we?

109
00:18:11,821 --> 00:18:16,621
Why should we try to 
show that we are happy?

110
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:18,634
We are very 
unhappy people.

111
00:18:18,902 --> 00:18:22,077
And all these things 
started here to begin with.

112
00:18:22,377 --> 00:18:25,514
Then came these 
your Orthodox Church.

113
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:29,045
Now this Orthodox Church is 
another one, which, of course,

114
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:33,338
is really doesn't treat women 
very well and treats them

115
00:18:33,601 --> 00:18:39,007
as if they are all the 
time unholy. Certain times

116
00:18:39,276 --> 00:18:42,738
they cannot go to church 
and they cannot touch people,

117
00:18:43,007 --> 00:18:45,850
all kinds of nonsensical 
ideas they had.

118
00:18:46,206 --> 00:18:49,288
That also made women 
very left-sided.

119
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:52,307
Then, on top of that, 
all this was happening

120
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:54,563
with these tragedies 
and all that.

121
00:18:54,976 --> 00:19:01,540
Suddenly the economic problem 
came up and people felt very,

122
00:19:01,827 --> 00:19:04,941
sort of, disgusted 
about that.

123
00:19:05,262 --> 00:19:07,394
So the left side 
became very,

124
00:19:07,712 --> 00:19:11,194
very prominent here 
and that is how I think

125
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:13,791
many of these left-sided,

126
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:17,979
bhootish organizations 
started here

127
00:19:18,566 --> 00:19:22,504
and many gurus came who 
made you feel miserable.

128
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:25,378
But the worst that was 
done by the Greek Church

129
00:19:25,728 --> 00:19:28,242
which made you feel so guilty.

130
00:19:28,548 --> 00:19:31,592
So you became 
very left-sided.

131
00:19:32,530 --> 00:19:35,974
Now this left-sidedness was 
later on counter-balanced

132
00:19:36,249 --> 00:19:38,727
by people who started 
becoming overactive;

133
00:19:38,996 --> 00:19:42,952
thinking too much, working too 
hard and all those things.

134
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:46,633
But still, I think that they don't 
work very hard as they should work.

135
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:49,327
They're on the lazy side, 
the Greeks are.

136
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,386
They're on the lazy side. Of course, 
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

137
00:19:52,642 --> 00:19:54,108
The Sahaja Yogis have 
worked very hard,

138
00:19:54,414 --> 00:19:57,425
I can see all that very 
clearly, but otherwise.

139
00:19:57,744 --> 00:20:03,833
So, now to bring 
out Sahaja Yoga

140
00:20:04,195 --> 00:20:07,456
in Greece, is important, 
first of all, to know

141
00:20:07,712 --> 00:20:11,244
what is our historical 
background.

142
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:13,957
The second, they should 
be very well equipped

143
00:20:14,187 --> 00:20:17,381
with the knowledge 
of chakras and centers

144
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:23,771
and how to improve these centers. 
If you do not have that knowledge,

145
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:26,913
you cannot face people. It's not 
that only men should know,

146
00:20:27,176 --> 00:20:29,828
women also should 
know everything about it.

147
00:20:30,084 --> 00:20:33,716
What is the chakras are, 
how they work out

148
00:20:35,303 --> 00:20:40,400
and what are their results 
are, how do we suffer

149
00:20:40,668 --> 00:20:42,880
because our chakras 
are in danger.

150
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:45,817
All this knowledge 
is free to you.

151
00:20:46,283 --> 00:20:49,059
You don't have to pay for 
this knowledge. Only thing,

152
00:20:49,321 --> 00:20:52,920
every day-to-day life, when you 
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

153
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:58,639
then you'll find that what I'm 
saying is absolutely tangible.

154
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:03,961
You can verify it. It is so. 
It's not something in the air.

155
00:21:04,204 --> 00:21:07,780
It is absolutely there. 
We can prove everything

156
00:21:08,025 --> 00:21:11,678
that we believe in and we 
can show others also

157
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:15,584
that this is the truth. 
Is an absolute truth.

158
00:21:15,884 --> 00:21:18,077
We are not here to 
spread some sort

159
00:21:18,365 --> 00:21:21,941
of a fanaticism or racialism 
or anything like that,

160
00:21:22,227 --> 00:21:25,215
but we are here to combine 
the whole world together

161
00:21:25,515 --> 00:21:29,810
under one understanding; that 
we belong to one universe

162
00:21:30,091 --> 00:21:33,879
and we have one 
universal religion.

163
00:21:34,322 --> 00:21:35,753
Now, people will ask 
you then,

164
00:21:36,034 --> 00:21:38,453
"Have we to give up 
your religion?"

165
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:40,141
You don't have to tell them that 
you have to give up your religion,

166
00:21:40,391 --> 00:21:43,174
don't have to say that. You don't 
have to be hard with them at all.

167
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:45,586
On the contrary, no, no, no, 
nothing has to be done.

168
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:50,449
You just come and take to Sahaja 
Yoga and take to your spirit.

169
00:21:50,736 --> 00:21:54,331
Gradually it will start 
opening out.

170
00:21:54,762 --> 00:21:56,531
It has happened with 
all of you

171
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:58,537
that first when you 
came to Sahaja Yoga

172
00:21:58,831 --> 00:22:01,572
you were in a different 
shape. Now gradually,

173
00:22:01,884 --> 00:22:03,478
you started opening 
out, you matured

174
00:22:03,766 --> 00:22:06,465
and you understood 
Sahaja Yoga very well.

175
00:22:06,746 --> 00:22:11,538
In the same way, you must 
teach others in the same manner,

176
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:16,647
with the same understanding, 
compassion and love.

177
00:22:16,897 --> 00:22:20,053
Otherwise, normally people 
think that somebody

178
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:22,664
is to be condemned 
all the time.

179
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,061
Of course, some are people 
who are under bad influence

180
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:31,122
and you cannot get along 
with them, but most of you

181
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:35,604
should know that we have to get 
more people into Sahaja Yoga

182
00:22:35,885 --> 00:22:42,135
through our compassion, love 
and also lot of understanding

183
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:48,665
about others' feelings. I've 
found that even countries

184
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,809
where have been Sahaja 
Yoga for so many time,

185
00:22:52,115 --> 00:22:57,275
suddenly someone comes up 
and starts giving trouble

186
00:22:57,575 --> 00:23:02,569
and becoming bhootish sort of 
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

187
00:23:02,894 --> 00:23:06,931
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person, 
you know, if it is informed,

188
00:23:07,187 --> 00:23:09,993
we can take him out of Sahaja 
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

189
00:23:10,299 --> 00:23:12,979
But all of you must know 
one thing for definite

190
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,685
that you all have these 
powers to cure yourself,

191
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:19,185
improve yourself, 
to help others.

192
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:21,701
You can do everything 
yourself.

193
00:23:22,008 --> 00:23:24,711
You all have these powers, 
but the only thing

194
00:23:24,979 --> 00:23:27,029
is you have to be 
sincere and honest.

195
00:23:27,361 --> 00:23:31,142
If you are not sincere and 
honest, it will never work out.

196
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:34,473
On the contrary, it will 
boomerang on you.

197
00:23:34,773 --> 00:23:39,889
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor- 
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

198
00:23:40,251 --> 00:23:42,951
You must have complete 
sincerity of purpose

199
00:23:43,219 --> 00:23:48,473
that you are here to achieve your 
own self-emancipation, first.

200
00:23:48,787 --> 00:23:55,936
And secondly, you are 
here to help others.

201
00:23:57,155 --> 00:24:01,886
The people all along in the 
whole world now require help.

202
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:05,955
There's so many problems, 
so many catastrophes,

203
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:12,792
so many horrible things 
we everyday know going on.

204
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:15,660
So now we need people who 
are solid, who are balanced,

205
00:24:15,923 --> 00:24:19,923
who are peaceful, who understand 
what is right and what is wrong.

206
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:22,243
But apart from that, 
you should know

207
00:24:22,476 --> 00:24:26,130
that you have now entered 
into the Kingdom of God.

208
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:28,924
Many people will say, all right, 
we were so religious,

209
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:31,157
we were praying to Christ, 
we were praying to this one,

210
00:24:31,384 --> 00:24:34,066
praying to that one. 
What did we get?

211
00:24:34,333 --> 00:24:36,935
You cannot get it because 
you are not connected.

212
00:24:37,191 --> 00:24:40,571
You have to be connected. Once 
you are connected to that,

213
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:44,570
then you will find that 
things start sorting out.

214
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:48,513
But sincerity is very important 
and faith in yourself.

215
00:24:48,922 --> 00:24:52,745
You must have faith in yourself 
that you're quite capable,

216
00:24:52,973 --> 00:24:57,268
quite capable person and 
you can achieve

217
00:24:57,829 --> 00:25:02,074
a very high degree of awareness by 
which you can work out many things.

218
00:25:02,307 --> 00:25:05,500
It doesn't matter from what sort 
of background you come in.

219
00:25:05,789 --> 00:25:08,095
It doesn't matter from what sort 
of country you come in,

220
00:25:08,351 --> 00:25:09,573
race anything.

221
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,288
You all can do very well

222
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:16,520
and we have seen this happening in 
so many countries where we had

223
00:25:16,751 --> 00:25:23,606
no hope at all. For example, 
a country like Russia,

224
00:25:24,390 --> 00:25:28,005
imagine, they've never 
worshipped any God.

225
00:25:28,238 --> 00:25:31,266
They didn't know about God. 
They were not allowed to know

226
00:25:31,510 --> 00:25:33,766
about any religion, 
anything,

227
00:25:34,053 --> 00:25:37,885
but suddenly I went there, I don't 
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

228
00:25:38,266 --> 00:25:41,309
They just recognized Me and 
just with My photograph

229
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,858
I find them there. I was 
amazed that the first time

230
00:25:44,158 --> 00:25:52,839
I went to Leningrad there were 
two thousand seats in the hall,

231
00:25:53,202 --> 00:25:55,359
but outside they were 
all standing. I said,

232
00:25:55,652 --> 00:25:57,283
"Why are they standing 
outside?" They said,

233
00:25:57,558 --> 00:25:59,920
"All the seats are full, Mother, 
and these are extra people.

234
00:26:00,265 --> 00:26:03,556
There are more than two 
thousand outside." So I said,

235
00:26:03,875 --> 00:26:07,194
"This is too much." And so they 
said, "Mother, what about us?"

236
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,325
I said, "All right, let me 
finish the program."

237
00:26:09,619 --> 00:26:12,258
I went inside, did the program, 
everything happened

238
00:26:12,634 --> 00:26:13,684
and you'll be amazed

239
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,406
when we had the program, 
the people who were outside

240
00:26:17,703 --> 00:26:20,662
were still waiting. I gave 
realization to people

241
00:26:20,925 --> 00:26:22,768
and they were waiting, 
waiting, waiting.

242
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:25,612
When I came out 
I gave them.

243
00:26:26,318 --> 00:26:27,735
I said, "Now, what to do?

244
00:26:28,011 --> 00:26:30,148
I can't give you 
realization just now."

245
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:32,586
So they said, "All right, 
what can we do?"

246
00:26:32,898 --> 00:26:34,769
I said, "Tomorrow morning 
can you come?" They said,

247
00:26:35,069 --> 00:26:38,267
"All right." So all those who were 
inside and those who were outside,

248
00:26:38,517 --> 00:26:41,470
all of them came and 
came and sat down

249
00:26:41,757 --> 00:26:46,722
and that open ground and 
I gave them realization.

250
00:26:47,003 --> 00:26:50,097
So this is the first beginning, 
but now in Moscow

251
00:26:50,378 --> 00:26:56,124
or any place we have to 
reserve a huge, big stadium.

252
00:26:56,487 --> 00:26:59,343
Fourteen to sixteen 
thousand people are there

253
00:26:59,606 --> 00:27:03,268
and realization is 
being given.

254
00:27:03,699 --> 00:27:06,286
But they are so quick 
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

255
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:10,979
so quick to accept Me, so quick 
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

256
00:27:11,273 --> 00:27:16,495
I just can't imagine how these 
Russians have got this capacity.

257
00:27:18,278 --> 00:27:20,022
No question of their 
going back,

258
00:27:20,328 --> 00:27:22,678
no question of their 
sincerity being challenged.

259
00:27:22,966 --> 00:27:28,798
There is no question of their 
doubting themselves, nothing.

260
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:33,648
Just there and so much so, 
so much that I sometimes feel

261
00:27:33,967 --> 00:27:36,429
this democracy has 
just harmed us.

262
00:27:36,898 --> 00:27:39,861
Because of democracy,of course, 
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

263
00:27:40,148 --> 00:27:45,131
but where the people are, 
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

264
00:27:45,469 --> 00:27:48,943
Like in America, I find there's 
very idiotic people live there

265
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:53,768
and they were only busy 
choosing their bathrooms

266
00:27:54,087 --> 00:27:58,343
and their curtains and their soaps 
and all the time they will choose,

267
00:27:58,630 --> 00:28:01,086
only busy with all these 
nonsensical things.

268
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:08,004
They are so idiotic, while the 
people in Russia are so sensible,

269
00:28:08,292 --> 00:28:15,075
so deep, so introspective and 
even the artists and the scientists.

270
00:28:16,375 --> 00:28:20,849
I had a conference with the scientists. 
There were about three hundred of them

271
00:28:21,250 --> 00:28:23,274
and I started talking to 
them about science.

272
00:28:23,531 --> 00:28:24,781
I thought, better start 
with science.

273
00:28:25,068 --> 00:28:26,699
They said, "Mother, no more 
science, no more science.

274
00:28:26,999 --> 00:28:30,761
Tell us the science 
of God."

275
00:28:32,393 --> 00:28:33,893
Such open-minded people.

276
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:37,018
We have two hundred 
doctors in Russia

277
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:42,299
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga 
and it has spread up to Siberia.

278
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:47,777
Now, what's the use 
of this democracy

279
00:28:48,033 --> 00:28:51,213
which doesn't take us to God. 
It doesn't give us sense

280
00:28:51,482 --> 00:28:55,270
that we should seek God and 
we should be humble towards God.

281
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:59,507
So what's the use of having 
this kind of a democracy and

282
00:28:59,819 --> 00:29:04,475
this kind of freedom which has 
made us mad and idiotic?

283
00:29:04,881 --> 00:29:07,812
And that's very true about 
every democratic country

284
00:29:08,093 --> 00:29:11,692
because you must know 
democracy is money-oriented.

285
00:29:12,549 --> 00:29:15,867
And you know Greeks are very money 
-oriented people also, as well.

286
00:29:16,148 --> 00:29:18,573
Of course, they're not 
as bad as Americans,

287
00:29:18,867 --> 00:29:20,598
but they are quite 
money-oriented.

288
00:29:20,886 --> 00:29:23,110
Also, Italians are very 
money-oriented,

289
00:29:23,392 --> 00:29:25,804
but the worst is 
the corruption.

290
00:29:26,321 --> 00:29:28,321
Now Italy is getting 
exposed.

291
00:29:28,609 --> 00:29:30,740
I'm sure your country will 
also get exposed.

292
00:29:31,021 --> 00:29:32,715
All these countries 
are to be exposed.

293
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:36,886
But, first of all, the Sahaja 
Yogis have to be firm people.

294
00:29:37,448 --> 00:29:41,035
They have to be very, very 
firm and they should know that

295
00:29:41,292 --> 00:29:43,605
Sahaja Yoga is only 
spirit-oriented,

296
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,742
nothing but 
spirit-oriented,

297
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:48,948
that you have to have 
your spirit enlightened,

298
00:29:49,267 --> 00:29:52,455
that your spirit has 
to work everything,

299
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:56,306
that you are not this body, 
this money, this position,

300
00:29:56,618 --> 00:30:00,154
these powers, nothing. 
But you are the spirit.

301
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:03,210
This is what one 
has to know.

302
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:06,931
I was told it is very 
difficult for you

303
00:30:07,237 --> 00:30:10,765
to come for pujas 
to Cabella

304
00:30:11,052 --> 00:30:14,688
you all cannot join, 
but one week,

305
00:30:14,988 --> 00:30:18,620
supposing you take 
during Guru Puja, I think.

306
00:30:18,908 --> 00:30:21,089
You can come by boat 
or something like that,

307
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:24,701
would be easier for you to 
come to Genoa by boat

308
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:27,870
and then we can organize 
your coming down.

309
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:31,613
For Guru Puja, you all should 
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

310
00:30:31,888 --> 00:30:35,313
and Guru Puja are 
very important

311
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:40,212
and if you could come for Guru 
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

312
00:30:40,711 --> 00:30:42,799
I think it can be 
arranged and organized

313
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:46,898
that you can come 
to Guru Puja.

314
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,460
I know it's wherever I am,

315
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:55,134
supposing if I have it here, then 
for all the rest of the people

316
00:30:55,445 --> 00:30:58,723
it will be far away. So 
I just thought of Milan

317
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:02,342
being quite in the center that 
it would be nearer to England,

318
00:31:02,623 --> 00:31:05,051
nearer to other European 
countries.

319
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:08,695
You see, the Americans and 
the South Americans

320
00:31:08,958 --> 00:31:11,779
find it very difficult, 
so this time

321
00:31:12,091 --> 00:31:14,301
we had to provide all 
tickets, everything

322
00:31:14,595 --> 00:31:18,095
to South Americans to come. 
But they're very deep people.

323
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,785
I was surprised in Colombia, they 
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

324
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,822
very beautiful 
Sahaja Yogis.

325
00:31:24,141 --> 00:31:28,404
Very simple-hearted, very 
good, well educated.

326
00:31:28,692 --> 00:31:33,144
Three, four of them got married 
in India and they're very happy.

327
00:31:36,172 --> 00:31:43,153
So, now for that, two 
things have to be done.

328
00:31:43,546 --> 00:31:50,996
Firstly, is that you 
should come to collective.

329
00:31:51,290 --> 00:31:54,275
It's very important. You all 
should come to collective

330
00:31:54,556 --> 00:31:58,712
and put your - please put attention 
to Me, not to them, alright.

331
00:31:59,099 --> 00:32:01,043
Please put your attention 
towards Me,

332
00:32:01,312 --> 00:32:02,967
don't turn your attention 
very much.

333
00:32:03,242 --> 00:32:07,861
You have to keep your attention 
all right. It's very important.

334
00:32:11,048 --> 00:32:15,323
So you have to one thing is 
to do, is to come to the collective

335
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:19,268
and watch out for your attention. 
Where is your attention?

336
00:32:19,574 --> 00:32:22,117
Where are you looking? Are you 
turning your head too much

337
00:32:22,406 --> 00:32:24,818
or are you putting your 
attention straight?

338
00:32:25,079 --> 00:32:28,448
It's very important that you 
must keep your attention

339
00:32:28,709 --> 00:32:32,072
absolutely wrapped and 
towards the meetings

340
00:32:32,305 --> 00:32:37,819
that you have here for 
your collective.

341
00:32:38,432 --> 00:32:41,914
In that way, when your 
attention is fixed you'll find

342
00:32:42,152 --> 00:32:45,334
you'll definitely rise into 
thoughtless awareness,

343
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,856
a state where you 
grow spiritually.

344
00:32:48,129 --> 00:32:52,031
You have to rise up to that 
state of thoughtless awareness

345
00:32:52,281 --> 00:32:55,151
where you grow 
spiritually.

346
00:32:55,463 --> 00:32:57,156
If you're not in thoughtless 
awareness,

347
00:32:57,401 --> 00:33:00,122
you cannot grow in 
your spirituality.

348
00:33:00,377 --> 00:33:04,483
So it's very important to 
see where is your attention.

349
00:33:04,726 --> 00:33:06,745
Where are you putting 
your attention?

350
00:33:07,008 --> 00:33:09,089
If the attention could 
be controlled

351
00:33:09,371 --> 00:33:11,414
then things will 
be all right.

352
00:33:11,689 --> 00:33:14,564
He is crying, 
the child is crying,

353
00:33:14,884 --> 00:33:18,302
may be you can take 
him outside a litle bit,

354
00:33:26,914 --> 00:33:32,307
he is feeling hot I think 
is all right now with the mother

355
00:33:47,368 --> 00:33:49,499
So the first thing is to 
be in the collective.

356
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:56,704
Now it's a very sinister, 
also idea of some people

357
00:33:56,978 --> 00:33:59,909
is to always break the 
collective, to create problems,

358
00:34:00,190 --> 00:34:06,614
to disregard the leaders. As a 
result, leaders also get so fed up,

359
00:34:06,908 --> 00:34:09,482
they give up, you see. They don't 
want to have anything to do.

360
00:34:09,819 --> 00:34:14,259
So they put up their own ideas, 
they try to trouble the leaders,

361
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:18,793
they create problems for them, they 
just try to show off everywhere,

362
00:34:19,069 --> 00:34:24,712
as if they know everything. All 
such people also create groups.

363
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:31,068
So beware about them. You should 
stick on always to the collective

364
00:34:31,356 --> 00:34:37,049
and not to anyone who tries to 
create a kind of a group at all

365
00:34:37,374 --> 00:34:42,936
or who troubles or who 
makes things difficult.

366
00:34:43,505 --> 00:34:47,649
You must understand those who 
are collective only will grow,

367
00:34:47,924 --> 00:34:53,011
those who aren't, will not grow. 
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

368
00:34:53,297 --> 00:34:57,361
then it doesn't grow. 
In the same manner,

369
00:34:57,675 --> 00:35:01,350
if you keep out of this 
thing, by any chance,

370
00:35:01,681 --> 00:35:03,637
if you have any problems 
with the leaders,

371
00:35:03,943 --> 00:35:05,574
you can always 
write to Me,

372
00:35:05,899 --> 00:35:07,766
you can tell Me, 
I can work it out.

373
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:12,641
But all the time, to go on 
like this and grouping

374
00:35:12,928 --> 00:35:15,846
like this will break and there 
will be someone who'll do that.

375
00:35:16,103 --> 00:35:18,953
There will be some negative 
person who'll try to do that.

376
00:35:19,203 --> 00:35:23,928
So, you have to be very careful 
not to get out of the collective.

377
00:35:24,202 --> 00:35:26,602
You must always 
support the collective,

378
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:32,208
must help this collective 
and must nourish it.

379
00:35:33,783 --> 00:35:36,232
As you know, I was 
telling him also

380
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,151
that he, if he has 
problem with money,

381
00:35:39,451 --> 00:35:42,132
we can give money 
from Cabella

382
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:44,613
because before that I used 
to travel on My own.

383
00:35:44,882 --> 00:35:48,807
Even to Greece, I came on 
My own, and paid for everything.

384
00:35:49,069 --> 00:35:52,375
So, see also, then Stomatis 
had to pay something,

385
00:35:52,688 --> 00:35:55,275
which I didn't like very much. 
He was paying so much,

386
00:35:55,549 --> 00:35:57,350
because we had such 
a small group.

387
00:35:57,625 --> 00:36:01,163
But now as you have a big 
group, you feel responsible,

388
00:36:01,462 --> 00:36:03,788
you want to pay for it. 
All right, doesn't matter.

389
00:36:04,087 --> 00:36:09,855
But not to pay for your Sahaja 
Yoga, not for your realization,

390
00:36:10,129 --> 00:36:14,473
not for knowledge of Sahaja 
Yoga. This is there.

391
00:36:14,754 --> 00:36:18,110
And so people will start putting 
ideas into your heads that,

392
00:36:18,372 --> 00:36:20,435
Why this? Why that?", 
and all that.

393
00:36:20,691 --> 00:36:23,540
Such people you should keep 
out because you are here

394
00:36:23,827 --> 00:36:26,277
to develop your spirituality 
and not to listen

395
00:36:26,546 --> 00:36:29,065
to these stupid people who 
have been troublesome.

396
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:32,577
So best is to keep 
to your own,

397
00:36:33,264 --> 00:36:38,157
own development and own 
nourishment. It's very important.

398
00:36:38,858 --> 00:36:42,545
So it is in a way collective, 
but also individual,

399
00:36:42,825 --> 00:36:45,722
because what you're 
gaining out of the collective

400
00:36:46,028 --> 00:36:48,259
you should be on the watch 
out, you should see for yourself

401
00:36:48,553 --> 00:36:50,697
what you are gaining 
out of the collective.

402
00:36:50,997 --> 00:36:53,515
Then secondly, at home, you 
must every day, every day,

403
00:36:53,815 --> 00:36:57,633
every day, again I say, 
not to miss it out,

404
00:36:57,952 --> 00:37:02,599
in the evening before sleeping 
you must have meditation.

405
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:05,381
You can wash 
yourself up, like,

406
00:37:05,693 --> 00:37:07,656
what you call, the water 
treatment or anything

407
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,872
then sit down for meditation 
for ten minutes.

408
00:37:10,185 --> 00:37:13,477
You must give fifteen minutes to 
yourself and then sleep off.

409
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:16,340
Supposing you can't do 
one night, doesn't matter,

410
00:37:16,627 --> 00:37:19,970
but try to do it every 
night. If not possible,

411
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:22,427
if you don't do it one night, 
you can do it in the morning.

412
00:37:22,726 --> 00:37:26,226
But it's very important. I can 
easily make out a person

413
00:37:26,513 --> 00:37:29,751
who does meditation and 
who does not do meditation.

414
00:37:30,138 --> 00:37:34,850
It's a difference, such a difference. 
I immediately know a person

415
00:37:35,175 --> 00:37:40,075
who is meditating 
everyday, in his health,

416
00:37:40,367 --> 00:37:44,899
in his face, in his behavior, 
in everything, he's very different.

417
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:48,396
And those who do not do 
any meditation you'll find,

418
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:52,596
not only that they are funny, 
but their children are funny,

419
00:37:52,896 --> 00:37:56,775
their relationships are 
funny, everything is funny.

420
00:37:57,124 --> 00:38:01,149
So the meditation is 
a very important part for you.

421
00:38:01,568 --> 00:38:03,886
Because also the women 
who are pregnant, when they,

422
00:38:04,186 --> 00:38:06,636
if they do not meditate 
their children turn out

423
00:38:06,924 --> 00:38:11,699
to be very troublesome and very 
funny. It's a thing like that.

424
00:38:12,043 --> 00:38:16,468
It effects everything. But your 
character of meditativeness,

425
00:38:16,736 --> 00:38:22,516
your character of Sahaja Yoga 
helps everyone, your children,

426
00:38:22,853 --> 00:38:25,185
your family, your society, 
everybody,

427
00:38:25,441 --> 00:38:29,084
and everybody can make it out 
what sort of a family you are,

428
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,728
what sort of a people you are, 
what sort of a personality you are.

429
00:38:32,984 --> 00:38:34,941
And from you they 
take to Sahaja Yoga.

430
00:38:35,215 --> 00:38:40,884
So is important in individual life 
also just to meditate, nothing else.

431
00:38:41,497 --> 00:38:46,190
You have to come to a state 
of thoughtless awareness.

432
00:38:46,496 --> 00:38:49,040
So the mantra is, as 
you know, Nirvichara.

433
00:38:49,296 --> 00:38:51,358
You should use the 
mantra of Nirvichara

434
00:38:51,632 --> 00:38:53,814
for coming to the 
state of thoughtlessness

435
00:38:54,077 --> 00:38:56,228
and try to increase 
this area,

436
00:38:56,546 --> 00:38:58,426
this space of thoughtless 
awareness

437
00:38:58,714 --> 00:39:02,807
and that is how you will find 
you will be growing very much.

438
00:39:03,301 --> 00:39:07,325
Now as you get lots of powers, 
as you get lots of people

439
00:39:07,657 --> 00:39:10,343
being realized by you, 
curing by you,

440
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:13,128
sometimes maybe it 
might affect your ego.

441
00:39:13,377 --> 00:39:17,640
You might get into ego things. 
For such people, I have to say

442
00:39:17,928 --> 00:39:20,928
that you have to be introspective 
and see for yourself.

443
00:39:21,221 --> 00:39:23,746
You face the mirror and ask 
now how much ego you have.

444
00:39:24,046 --> 00:39:27,202
Laugh at yourself. Once you 
start laughing at yourself,

445
00:39:27,477 --> 00:39:29,932
your ego will drop out 
and you'll understand

446
00:39:30,189 --> 00:39:34,189
that it was false to have this 
kind of ego within you.

447
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:37,718
There are so many ways and methods 
of finding out about yourself.

448
00:39:38,007 --> 00:39:41,275
Put yourself into bandhan and put 
your hands towards the photograph,

449
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,988
immediately you can feel what 
chakras are catching

450
00:39:44,295 --> 00:39:48,288
and you know how to clear it out. 
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

451
00:39:48,557 --> 00:39:50,971
If your chakras are catching, 
you can feel it inside

452
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:56,368
and you can feel it, 
the different centers

453
00:39:56,637 --> 00:39:58,980
on your fingertips 
about yourself.

454
00:39:59,261 --> 00:40:03,654
So it is about yourself you will 
know. About others, you know,

455
00:40:03,929 --> 00:40:06,028
you should just talk on 
chakras. You should not say,

456
00:40:06,301 --> 00:40:09,203
he's bhootish, or he has ego 
- nothing. But you should say,

457
00:40:09,466 --> 00:40:12,709
his Agnya is catching, 
means he has got ego.

458
00:40:13,028 --> 00:40:15,984
You can say, his Nabhi's bad, 
his, this thing is bad.

459
00:40:16,246 --> 00:40:17,914
So the language is 
to change now.

460
00:40:18,189 --> 00:40:23,239
We have to talk in the 
language of Sahaja Yoga.

461
00:40:23,939 --> 00:40:27,795
It is to be understood that 
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

462
00:40:28,082 --> 00:40:31,319
We've got the powers 
we have vibratory powers.

463
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,211
But if you don't use these vibratory 
powers, what is going to happen?

464
00:40:37,018 --> 00:40:39,024
We have to use them, 
that's the point.

465
00:40:39,268 --> 00:40:41,455
We always forget. I've 
seen, the other day

466
00:40:41,733 --> 00:40:43,586
they couldn't open something. 
I said, "Give a bandhan."

467
00:40:43,867 --> 00:40:46,260
Gave a bandhan and immediately 
it worked out, you see.

468
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:48,496
Small, small things also 
you'll be surprised

469
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,591
that if it doesn't work out, you have 
to just give a bandhan

470
00:40:50,836 --> 00:40:52,302
and it works out.

471
00:40:52,641 --> 00:40:55,003
It is important to know 
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

472
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,928
you are saints and that 
you can do lots of things

473
00:40:58,209 --> 00:41:00,472
and you shouldn't forget it. 
You shouldn't forget it

474
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:03,740
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now 
you are no more ordinary people.

475
00:41:04,015 --> 00:41:06,533
You are saints now and 
you can do a lot.

476
00:41:06,815 --> 00:41:10,783
All this, when it works out, 
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

477
00:41:11,077 --> 00:41:13,958
how you have achieved 
all these things.

478
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:17,419
And, I tell you, people tell Me 
that they look like roses,

479
00:41:17,694 --> 00:41:20,489
all of their faces shining, 
they look so beautiful and

480
00:41:20,791 --> 00:41:22,846
they can make it out that 
you are Sahaja Yogis.

481
00:41:23,159 --> 00:41:25,568
I've seen at the airport 
also many people say that,

482
00:41:25,863 --> 00:41:27,250
"Who were those people

483
00:41:27,551 --> 00:41:32,426
looking so sweet and beautiful, 
shining. Who were those?"

484
00:41:32,785 --> 00:41:35,491
So if I tell them that they 
are saints, they won't believe

485
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,241
that there could be so 
many saints, but there are

486
00:41:38,517 --> 00:41:40,841
and we have achieved 
that all over the world.

487
00:41:41,116 --> 00:41:43,410
All over the world now there 
are so many Sahaja Yogis

488
00:41:43,691 --> 00:41:47,762
that I can't even say how many they 
are, in thousands and thousands.

489
00:41:48,082 --> 00:41:50,242
So, I again tell 
you that Greece

490
00:41:50,509 --> 00:41:52,577
is a place where 
you can do a lot.

491
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:55,870
First of all, you must establish 
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

492
00:41:56,127 --> 00:41:59,295
and you have to 
know what you are,

493
00:41:59,577 --> 00:42:02,014
all the time to remember what 
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

494
00:42:02,301 --> 00:42:04,513
Even to children, you have 
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

495
00:42:04,789 --> 00:42:07,556
so they also develop that 
personality by which

496
00:42:07,868 --> 00:42:10,731
they behave properly and 
they behave in a manner

497
00:42:11,044 --> 00:42:13,805
that a Sahaja Yogi 
should behave.

498
00:42:14,912 --> 00:42:19,962
So all these things are just 
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

499
00:42:20,249 --> 00:42:24,061
but I am sure you must be 
getting my tapes from Cabella

500
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:27,174
and you must be knowing 
about all the deeper things

501
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,922
about yourself and 
about Sahaja Yoga.

502
00:42:30,205 --> 00:42:34,029
It's a new age 
that has started.

503
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:37,630
The other day I said that the 
Satya Yuga has started now.

504
00:42:37,973 --> 00:42:40,366
So it will start exposing 
all that is a-satya,

505
00:42:40,673 --> 00:42:43,309
which is whatever is false. 
All those who are false people

506
00:42:43,603 --> 00:42:47,746
will be exposed and you'll 
be amazed at the way

507
00:42:48,052 --> 00:42:52,451
things will work out. And it's 
such a great time you are born

508
00:42:52,781 --> 00:42:55,900
and it's such a great thing that 
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

509
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:58,059
and that you have 
got your realization

510
00:42:58,309 --> 00:43:00,326
and that you are 
one of those

511
00:43:00,638 --> 00:43:05,595
who have to lift the whole of this 
universe into a higher awareness.

512
00:43:05,888 --> 00:43:07,900
Of course, we can't say 
how many will be saved.

513
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:12,088
It's another point because 
what I know about is that

514
00:43:12,369 --> 00:43:16,999
in the evolutionary portion, 
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

515
00:43:17,267 --> 00:43:20,224
many were lost 
in between, you know,

516
00:43:20,524 --> 00:43:24,274
and there are so many 
chimpanzees now left

517
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:27,217
and there's the middle, 
the people were lost.

518
00:43:27,504 --> 00:43:29,447
In the same way, many 
human beings may be lost

519
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:33,808
because of their stupidity, because 
of their self-destructive habits

520
00:43:34,087 --> 00:43:36,310
that they have formed.

521
00:43:36,673 --> 00:43:38,554
But your responsibility 
is very great.

522
00:43:38,779 --> 00:43:41,660
Don't think, I am just mediocre. 
I'm good for nothing.

523
00:43:41,916 --> 00:43:43,285
Never. Never think 
like that.

524
00:43:43,563 --> 00:43:47,328
You are all saints and you 
are capable of great things.

525
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:50,165
May God bless you.

526
00:43:54,309 --> 00:43:57,246
So today they want to 
do the puja of Athena

527
00:43:57,616 --> 00:44:00,477
And you will be surprised 
that the names of Athena

528
00:44:00,766 --> 00:44:06,252
are exactly about the same as 
that of the Goddess, of Adi Shakti.

529
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:09,533
Is very surprising, they 
have such beautiful names.

530
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,765
But we can have hundred 
and eight names of… today

531
00:44:14,013 --> 00:44:16,918
and you can read the 
names and the meanings

532
00:44:17,181 --> 00:44:19,162
and they can 
say the mantras.

533
00:44:19,469 --> 00:44:21,931
But first the children 
have to wash My feet

534
00:44:22,206 --> 00:44:25,543
with Ganesha stuti, 
you can sing

535
00:44:25,981 --> 00:44:27,723
Ganesha stuti.

536
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:32,766
You've got some musical 
instrument or not?

537
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,098
Yes, yes. 
You have.
