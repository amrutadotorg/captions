00:57.320 --> 00:59.880
Sorry (inaudible) this is (inaudible)

01:01.680 --> 01:05.800
you'll spoil the carpets, be careful

01:27.000 --> 01:30.040
Please be seated.

02:59.880 --> 03:01.200
It’s all right.

03:02.800 --> 03:06.800
I hope you can hear Me all the way, can you?

03:07.000 --> 03:10.040
Come forward a little bit, perhaps.

04:10.480 --> 04:14.360
Today is a very

04:15.160 --> 04:19.200
joyous that all of us are here in Turkey,

04:19.920 --> 04:26.360
to celebrate the Puja of Fatima.

04:35.120 --> 04:41.320
As you know about Her that She was the daughter

04:41.560 --> 04:46.640
of Mohammed Sahib and was married to Ali,

04:46.840 --> 04:50.600
and She had two children, Hassan and Hussein,

04:51.200 --> 04:55.360
who were ultimately killed in Karbala

04:55.600 --> 04:58.040
by the fanatics,

04:58.240 --> 05:02.240
who were that time called themselves Sunnis.

05:07.920 --> 05:15.400
All this happened because there were fanaticism,

05:17.360 --> 05:19.960
and the fanaticism

05:20.160 --> 05:23.160
that makes person thinks always

05:23.640 --> 05:26.680
that they are on the right

05:26.880 --> 05:31.680
and they have every right to be

05:34.560 --> 05:39.320
angry, to persuade, to convince another party,

05:39.560 --> 05:41.200
another person.

05:42.760 --> 05:45.960
And these fanaticisms grew

05:46.160 --> 05:49.200
since long – it’s not a new thing.

05:52.600 --> 05:57.400
It is so obvious now that our main problem

05:57.600 --> 06:01.440
in this world is of fanaticism.

06:02.720 --> 06:05.640
Fatima lost Her two children,

06:05.840 --> 06:09.720
and She was the embodiment of

06:09.920 --> 06:12.120
Gruha Lakshmi.

06:12.640 --> 06:16.240
She resides in our Left Nabhi.

06:16.720 --> 06:21.320
So for all the diseases that are connected with the spleen,

06:24.600 --> 06:29.760
all the problems that are connected with your Left Nabhi

06:29.960 --> 06:35.400
can be only corrected by Fatima.

06:35.640 --> 06:39.560
So you have to keep Fatima awakened within yourself.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.360
That we are here in the Islamic culture,

06:43.600 --> 06:47.240
we can say, this is place of Islamic culture;

06:52.400 --> 06:55.680
and in the Islamic culture a housewife was given

06:55.880 --> 06:59.080
a very, very important place.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.960
At the time of Mohammed Sahib

07:05.160 --> 07:09.080
there were struggles and fights

07:09.280 --> 07:12.720
and wars going on between different tribes.

07:13.360 --> 07:17.680
As a result many, many

07:19.120 --> 07:21.680
young men were killed.

07:23.920 --> 07:28.440
Only quite old people survived,

07:28.960 --> 07:33.000
and also so many women.

07:33.200 --> 07:37.880
This is the reason why Mohammed said that

07:38.080 --> 07:41.120
“You can marry four wives, five wives;

07:42.040 --> 07:47.120
but you cannot allow them to remain

07:49.120 --> 07:55.800
unmarried or they will have extramarital relationships.

07:56.840 --> 08:01.360
That will be the greatest fall for Islam,

08:01.800 --> 08:03.720
for that religion.”

08:05.200 --> 08:08.760
So He understood that unless and until

08:08.960 --> 08:12.960
women are kept absolutely chaste,

08:14.440 --> 08:16.960
absolutely pure,

08:19.640 --> 08:21.920
there cannot be the Kingdom of God.

08:22.120 --> 08:23.680
In Sanskrit there’s a saying,

08:23.880 --> 08:27.400
“Yatra narya pujyante, tatra ramante devata”:

08:27.640 --> 08:31.320
meaning “Where the women are respected,

08:32.040 --> 08:34.800
are worshipped and they are worshipful” –

08:35.000 --> 08:37.040
not that they are to be worshipped,

08:37.240 --> 08:40.080
but they are respectable –

08:40.280 --> 08:45.480
“there only exists the Kingdom of God.”

08:46.480 --> 08:51.160
So, so much responsibility is on women.

08:52.920 --> 08:55.360
So from Fatima’s life we have to know that

08:55.920 --> 08:59.400
She did not go out of Her house

08:59.640 --> 09:03.080
and She remained a housewife,

09:03.680 --> 09:06.720
and She made Her two children grow up

09:07.240 --> 09:11.040
in such a manner that they had to fight the war

09:11.240 --> 09:13.680
against fanaticism.

09:14.840 --> 09:17.760
Her husband also was there.

09:17.960 --> 09:21.920
This is how a woman of a housewife

09:22.560 --> 09:25.720
is shown to be so powerful that though

09:25.920 --> 09:28.360
she’s in the house, though she’s –

09:28.600 --> 09:30.400
looks to be just a mother,

09:30.640 --> 09:33.200
but how powerful she is.

09:37.760 --> 09:43.440
But these days a new type of ideas have come up.

09:43.680 --> 09:46.120
Men also have been very nasty

09:46.320 --> 09:49.080
and very aggressive with women.

09:49.280 --> 09:53.440
As a result we find there’s a big

09:54.480 --> 09:58.680
opposition to men,

09:59.240 --> 10:02.440
and a kind of a big rift has been created

10:02.680 --> 10:05.640
between men and women.

10:07.800 --> 10:11.720
Also the men, the way they started becoming licentious,

10:11.920 --> 10:14.360
perverted,

10:14.600 --> 10:17.320
going to bad women,

10:18.040 --> 10:19.240
the good women also thought,

10:19.440 --> 10:22.120
“Why not we also become like that?”

10:22.560 --> 10:26.080
and they also started doing wrong things

10:26.280 --> 10:28.680
which they should not have done.

10:28.880 --> 10:33.200
That’s how the whole society crumbled down.

10:34.560 --> 10:39.080
Now, the men are responsible for the politics and the economics

10:39.280 --> 10:44.600
and also the nation, as administrators,

10:45.240 --> 10:48.640
but women are responsible for the society.

10:50.480 --> 10:53.840
Whether she’s in the house or she’s outside,

10:54.040 --> 10:57.480
whether she’s working in the house or outside,

10:57.680 --> 11:01.040
she is responsible for

11:01.680 --> 11:05.240
the maintenance of the society.

11:06.800 --> 11:09.600
And there it looks as, sometimes to a woman,

11:09.800 --> 11:12.120
that she’s dominated,

11:12.320 --> 11:14.120
that her husband dominates her,

11:14.320 --> 11:17.040
that the husband’s family dominates her,

11:17.240 --> 11:19.800
but it’s the quality of a woman

11:20.000 --> 11:23.760
that brings up the level of the society.

11:23.960 --> 11:25.200
Not only the level,

11:25.400 --> 11:29.560
but also in the family she is then respected.

11:31.960 --> 11:35.440
It’s a very important role as a housewife;

11:35.680 --> 11:38.320
perhaps we never realize it.

11:38.680 --> 11:40.920
Now we see so many lights here,

11:41.120 --> 11:43.720
electricity is there running.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.640
But what is the source of this electricity?

11:47.320 --> 11:51.240
Is it not much more important than these lights?

11:51.960 --> 11:56.920
So men are nothing but, we can say, the kinetic energy,

11:57.320 --> 12:00.880
but what is the potential is the woman of the house.

12:01.920 --> 12:06.600
But these days it’s becoming a very funny situation.

12:07.440 --> 12:10.640
I was surprised when I went to

12:10.840 --> 12:13.240
Italy also, that

12:13.960 --> 12:17.360
how women have made themself cheap.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.480
And they want to look attractive to every man.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.920
What is the need?

12:25.960 --> 12:28.760
It’s a joyless pursuit into which men are going,

12:28.960 --> 12:33.120
and women are making themselves absolutely cheap.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.800
This cheapness of women

12:38.000 --> 12:41.720
is not going to give them any strength or joy.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.680
I know one feels very unhappy

12:44.880 --> 12:47.360
the way men treat them.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.240
But you must have your own personality,

12:50.440 --> 12:53.880
you must have your own understanding

12:54.080 --> 12:56.960
that you are a woman, you are shakti,

12:58.120 --> 13:01.360
and nobody can suppress the shakti.

13:01.600 --> 13:05.720
But if you do not keep to your own

13:05.920 --> 13:08.080
personality or your chastity,

13:09.080 --> 13:11.640
then you cannot achieve

13:13.040 --> 13:15.160
your goal in life.

13:15.360 --> 13:20.560
And your goal in life is to give power to your son,

13:20.760 --> 13:22.920
to your husband,

13:23.480 --> 13:27.200
to all the society the woman gives power.

13:27.400 --> 13:29.440
I am also a woman, as you know,

13:29.680 --> 13:32.360
and I also have a family.

13:33.600 --> 13:36.120
With all the powers that I have,

13:36.320 --> 13:40.760
I never showed them that I have those powers.

13:41.360 --> 13:43.280
I always listened to My husband, obeyed him

13:43.480 --> 13:46.680
though sometimes he was very unreasonable also.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.000
And he also came from a society

13:50.200 --> 13:53.640
which was more Islamic-oriented.

13:54.840 --> 13:58.200
But that was just a joke for Me,

13:59.440 --> 14:01.200
because I thought

14:01.400 --> 14:04.160
“He’s just like a child

14:04.360 --> 14:06.880
and I have to be

14:08.880 --> 14:11.280
very patient with him.”

14:12.160 --> 14:14.560
He always says that because of My powers

14:14.760 --> 14:16.440
he earned everything in life.

14:16.680 --> 14:19.320
Always, in the presence of everyone he says so.

14:19.560 --> 14:21.880
I don’t know that part, but definitely

14:22.080 --> 14:26.600
I feel very satisfied with My own married life.

14:27.200 --> 14:30.360
I never think the way other people think

14:30.560 --> 14:32.680
that we must try to dominate the husband,

14:32.880 --> 14:36.360
we must fight him, we must have a right to do this.

14:36.600 --> 14:40.600
Our right is within ourselves, within our powers.

14:41.880 --> 14:46.280
Also the men must realize that they have to respect women.

14:46.880 --> 14:48.760
I mean, not to such an extent that she tells you

14:48.960 --> 14:50.080
to do something wrong,

14:50.280 --> 14:52.760
and you just get lost with this – that’s not the way.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.040
That’s slavishness.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.480
Men have to be men.

14:57.760 --> 15:01.120
It in no way means the women are dominated by men.

15:01.320 --> 15:04.200
I do not say it that way;

15:04.400 --> 15:06.920
because if you have your own powers,

15:07.120 --> 15:08.880
ultimately whatever may be the husband,

15:09.080 --> 15:12.800
he’ll have to come and

15:13.440 --> 15:17.160
understand what you want.

15:17.760 --> 15:20.320
He’ll have to know what you are.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.400
I have seen it many-a-times in My own lifetime

15:23.640 --> 15:26.600
that it has done that way.

15:26.800 --> 15:29.120
I would never say anything.

15:30.000 --> 15:32.040
Supposing he gets angry, I would keep quiet.

15:32.240 --> 15:33.880
All right.

15:34.080 --> 15:35.920
After all he has to fight outside

15:36.120 --> 15:38.080
and he has to take out temper on Me

15:38.280 --> 15:39.400
that he couldn’t do:

15:39.600 --> 15:41.120
if he does this to others they will beat him,

15:41.320 --> 15:43.880
so it’s better he takes out temper on Me.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.560
And I never, never felt that way

15:46.760 --> 15:48.000
that he’s dominating Me.

15:48.200 --> 15:51.080
Only thing I thought, he’s taking out his temper.

15:51.280 --> 15:53.920
But I’ve seen that whenever

15:54.120 --> 15:59.280
I said something to him, he thought about it.

15:59.480 --> 16:03.560
In his lifetime I’ve taken eleven decisions;

16:04.280 --> 16:06.960
and all these decisions

16:07.160 --> 16:10.280
he still remembers one by one

16:10.480 --> 16:13.720
and knows that it was very, very important.

16:13.920 --> 16:17.240
Other things I never tell him what to do.

16:17.440 --> 16:21.400
Whatever was most important is the principle.

16:22.360 --> 16:26.160
Now, he also realized that

16:26.360 --> 16:28.960
I have a very important mission.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.360
So he gave Me money, he gave Me time, gave Me all freedom.

16:32.560 --> 16:35.440
But first I had to establish Myself

16:35.680 --> 16:39.640
as a very sensible, devoted wife.

16:42.280 --> 16:45.800
The men as a whole are very different type,

16:46.000 --> 16:47.800
you must understand.

16:48.040 --> 16:50.280
They are extroverts,

16:50.480 --> 16:52.120
and whatever the women care

16:52.320 --> 16:54.040
too much for, they do not.

16:54.240 --> 16:55.760
It’s all right,

16:55.960 --> 17:00.000
because women and men are complementary.

17:00.760 --> 17:04.360
Like Ali was there outside working everything out,

17:04.600 --> 17:09.240
while Fatima Bi in the house, home,

17:09.440 --> 17:10.960
who never went out,

17:11.160 --> 17:13.720
but he knew his source of energy

17:13.920 --> 17:16.440
from where it was coming.

17:19.080 --> 17:22.280
Because women were never respected as shakti,

17:22.560 --> 17:28.240
they started getting drifted into this Western modern ideas

17:28.440 --> 17:30.760
that “we have to fight men,

17:30.960 --> 17:33.800
they are problematic, they are troubling us

17:34.000 --> 17:37.760
and we should take revenge.”

17:37.960 --> 17:41.160
That’s how society cannot work out.

17:42.840 --> 17:45.640
Responsibility of the women is much greater

17:45.840 --> 17:48.160
than that of men.

17:48.360 --> 17:51.040
Men have to just go to offices,

17:52.960 --> 17:55.680
work it out something, come back home.

17:56.240 --> 18:01.440
Women have to lifelong generate the energy

18:01.680 --> 18:03.760
for the growth of the children,

18:03.960 --> 18:05.720
the protection of the husband,

18:05.920 --> 18:09.160
for all the sensible things that she has to do.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.320
That’s why in India we say,

18:11.560 --> 18:15.640
“A woman is to be absolutely respected,

18:16.480 --> 18:19.120
and she has to be respectable.”

18:19.320 --> 18:21.560
Moreover it is not only in India,

18:21.760 --> 18:25.160
I’ve seen it all over that women

18:25.360 --> 18:28.200
are always respected if they are housewives.

18:28.400 --> 18:30.400
For example,

18:30.840 --> 18:34.600
I go with My husband to some function.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.440
I’m respected as much as he is respected.

18:38.680 --> 18:39.480
For example,

18:39.680 --> 18:42.880
his deputy won’t be respected as I am respected,

18:43.160 --> 18:45.120
his secretary won’t be respected.

18:45.920 --> 18:46.880
No one.

18:47.080 --> 18:52.200
I, as his wife, is respected the same way because I’m his wife.

18:54.120 --> 18:57.200
Nobody looks down upon Me

18:57.400 --> 18:59.560
because I’m somebody’s wife.

18:59.760 --> 19:01.800
Is all over it is like this.

19:02.000 --> 19:04.760
I’ll give you a case of a lady I knew.

19:04.960 --> 19:07.640
She used to think she’s a very smart person, you know,

19:07.840 --> 19:09.840
always looked after her body and just

19:10.040 --> 19:11.760
to be thin and all that,

19:11.960 --> 19:13.400
and she wanted to attract all the men

19:13.600 --> 19:15.640
and all kinds of things,

19:15.880 --> 19:17.520
she would wear, you see, jeans and,

19:17.720 --> 19:19.960
you know, quite old lady.

19:20.160 --> 19:22.400
And her husband was a big man

19:22.640 --> 19:24.920
he was a chief cabinet secretary,

19:25.120 --> 19:27.160
very senior to us.

19:27.360 --> 19:30.880
So one day we were all invited for a dinner.

19:33.080 --> 19:35.720
So, she was not there.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.280
So many asked him, so many people,

19:37.480 --> 19:40.240
“Where is your wife, where is your wife?”

19:40.440 --> 19:42.280
He said, “I don’t know where she is.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.800
She was to come here.”

19:45.000 --> 19:47.760
I was also thinking where is she, where is she gone,

19:47.960 --> 19:51.760
because there was a seat for her, a special seat.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.360
So before sitting for the dinner

19:54.600 --> 19:58.040
I went for, I went into the bathroom.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.800
And there the poor thing was sitting on one corner.

20:01.000 --> 20:03.640
I said, “Why are you sitting here?”

20:04.640 --> 20:07.040
So she said, “They made me sit here.

20:07.240 --> 20:09.280
I don’t know what to do.”

20:09.480 --> 20:12.320
So I brought her out. I said,

20:12.560 --> 20:14.120
“Why did you make her sit there?”

20:14.320 --> 20:15.920
And she was thinking she’s very smart

20:16.120 --> 20:17.560
she’s done her hair nicely,

20:17.760 --> 20:20.320
she’s looking like an actress.

20:20.560 --> 20:23.000
“Oh, is she the wife?” I said, “Yes.”

20:23.200 --> 20:26.640
“Oh, my God! We thought she’s the secretary.

20:26.840 --> 20:29.240
How could she be? She has no dignity of her own,

20:29.440 --> 20:31.960
the way she was dressed stupidly.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.560
How can we believe that she’s the wife?

20:34.760 --> 20:37.800
She has no dignity as a wife of a Indian

20:38.000 --> 20:40.000
gentleman so highly placed.”

20:40.200 --> 20:42.960
And poor thing was sitting there for half-an-hour,

20:43.160 --> 20:45.240
smoking.

20:48.680 --> 20:50.760
They couldn’t believe it. Then they asked Me,

20:50.960 --> 20:52.880
“Are You sure she’s his wife?”

20:53.080 --> 20:55.640
I said, “Yes, I’m sure.”

20:56.120 --> 20:59.920
I mean, she came to the table, nobody got up for her.

21:00.120 --> 21:02.360
And they still thought, all the rest,

21:02.600 --> 21:05.200
she’s the secretary who has come.

21:05.840 --> 21:08.120
Then we had to tell them, “that’s his wife.”

21:08.320 --> 21:11.640
She was thinking she’s a smart young lady, you know;

21:11.840 --> 21:15.320
at that old age behaving stupidly.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.960
So even in the West a woman is respected

21:19.160 --> 21:21.600
if she’s a good housewife.

21:21.800 --> 21:25.360
Anywhere, she is respected.

21:25.760 --> 21:27.800
I was surprised also that

21:28.000 --> 21:30.760
I knew somebody very highly placed,

21:30.960 --> 21:34.480
a minister in the cabinet

21:34.720 --> 21:37.000
of England,

21:37.200 --> 21:40.000
and he was

21:40.240 --> 21:44.080
supposed to be little wayward

21:47.120 --> 21:50.040
and nobody would take notice of him.

21:51.040 --> 21:54.120
Nobody would. “Don’t look at him!”

21:54.320 --> 21:56.480
I was not so good at the scandals

21:56.720 --> 22:00.080
that they had in the all diplomatic circles,

22:01.160 --> 22:02.800
but I said that “Why don’t you talk to this man?”

22:03.000 --> 22:04.760
“No, not worth it.”

22:04.960 --> 22:06.040
I said, “Why?”

22:06.240 --> 22:11.560
They said, “He’s horrible. He is not a good man.”

22:12.040 --> 22:14.040
“Yes, but why? What has he done?”

22:14.240 --> 22:15.760
They said, “He’s a flirt,

22:15.960 --> 22:20.000
and he is looking at other women

22:20.200 --> 22:23.080
and he’s doing all kinds of things,”

22:23.280 --> 22:25.920
and they told stories about him. My God!

22:26.120 --> 22:29.120
Such a big man like a minister –

22:29.440 --> 22:31.800
why is he behaving like this?

22:32.000 --> 22:35.760
Like a stupid donkey, he is going about …

22:35.960 --> 22:37.600
Nobody would shake hands with him.

22:37.800 --> 22:40.800
Even men would not look at him.

22:43.080 --> 22:46.600
Now, of course, a new society is forming of all these

22:46.800 --> 22:49.400
stupid people. That’s different.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.280
But one Sahaja Yogi

22:52.480 --> 22:54.840
who will visit these places

22:55.040 --> 22:58.040
will be amazed how stupid they are.

22:58.960 --> 23:00.480
They can make it out.

23:00.720 --> 23:04.000
All of them catch on their Left Nabhi,

23:04.200 --> 23:06.760
whether they are women or men.

23:06.960 --> 23:11.800
But it’s more dangerous for men if they have a wife like that.

23:12.000 --> 23:15.400
Now, the Left Nabhi if it catches, what happens?

23:15.640 --> 23:18.000
What diseases you'll have?

23:18.200 --> 23:22.840
The first and foremost is blood cancer.

23:23.320 --> 23:26.320
With the Left Nabhi you can get blood cancer.

23:26.640 --> 23:29.240
Women think they can dominate their husband,

23:29.440 --> 23:31.120
they can do this to their husband,

23:31.320 --> 23:32.920
they can put them right, but they don’t know

23:33.120 --> 23:38.400
they are causing a serious disease like blood cancer.

23:40.960 --> 23:43.720
I know of somebody who was suffering

23:43.920 --> 23:46.400
from blood cancer, but we cured him

23:46.600 --> 23:49.480
and then we discovered his Left Nabhi was still bad.

23:49.720 --> 23:51.760
Again and again he was getting relapse.

23:51.960 --> 23:55.720
Then we found out it was his wife.

23:57.920 --> 24:01.160
She was such a dangerous woman for him.

24:01.360 --> 24:04.360
And he wouldn’t leave her, wouldn’t leave her.

24:04.600 --> 24:06.840
So I told him, “I will not treat you again

24:07.040 --> 24:08.360
if you live with that woman.

24:08.560 --> 24:11.920
Better throw her out, or you send her somewhere else.

24:12.120 --> 24:14.640
But if you are going to live with this woman,

24:14.840 --> 24:16.640
I’m not going to treat you.”

24:16.840 --> 24:19.600
He also called her and I told her on her face

24:19.800 --> 24:23.040
that “You’re a very dominating, horrible shrew woman,

24:23.240 --> 24:25.920
and if you try to torture your husband,

24:26.120 --> 24:28.800
he cannot be cured.”

24:29.600 --> 24:31.080
But she went on.

24:31.280 --> 24:35.760
And then, the end result was horrible, horrible, horrible.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.840
He developed a big spleen like that,

24:39.040 --> 24:41.960
all of it was taken out, and doctors told that

24:42.160 --> 24:45.040
“within six months you’ll be finished.”

24:45.800 --> 24:48.240
So on both the cases, I would say,

24:48.440 --> 24:50.360
the wife tried to dominate the husband,

24:50.560 --> 24:54.000
and husband getting attached to that wife still.

24:54.200 --> 24:56.880
It’s recent case I’m telling you.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.280
Now, we are husband and wife

24:59.480 --> 25:03.120
because we love each other, we are complementary.

25:03.320 --> 25:05.840
Woman is a woman, man is a man.

25:06.040 --> 25:10.560
Men should not expect women to be like you – very fast,

25:10.760 --> 25:14.480
and women should not expect men to be like you –

25:15.560 --> 25:20.280
very, I should say, noble.

25:20.960 --> 25:25.360
They are qualities of a woman and the qualities of a man.

25:25.720 --> 25:29.960
But the greatest power of a woman is her chastity.

25:30.960 --> 25:33.600
If her chastity is disturbed,

25:34.080 --> 25:37.560
then she is a dangerous person,

25:37.760 --> 25:39.640
very dangerous.

25:40.280 --> 25:43.160
She can not only harm her husband,

25:43.360 --> 25:46.400
but also her children, her society.

25:47.920 --> 25:50.960
We come from a culture which is very akin

25:51.160 --> 25:54.160
to Islamic culture also.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.440
Indian culture is like that.

25:57.880 --> 26:00.760
In the Indian culture women respect their chastity

26:00.960 --> 26:02.520
more than anything in this world.

26:02.720 --> 26:06.160
They can give up everything, but not their chastity.

26:07.360 --> 26:08.840
And once - there’s a story

26:09.040 --> 26:10.840
I must tell you, very interesting,

26:11.040 --> 26:14.040
about a very beautiful woman called Padmini.

26:14.240 --> 26:16.000
She was the wife of a king.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.360
And there was a horrible Muslim king who wanted

26:19.560 --> 26:22.760
to see this woman, because he heard she was very beautiful.

26:22.960 --> 26:26.040
See, this is, was a funny thing.

26:26.480 --> 26:29.920
And she came, and he came to that kingdom

26:30.120 --> 26:32.480
and he said, “I must look at this lady, otherwise

26:32.680 --> 26:35.160
I’ll destroy the whole kingdom.”

26:35.360 --> 26:38.480
Now people said, “This he can’t do, she’s our queen.

26:38.680 --> 26:42.000
She can’t, he can’t see our queen like that.”

26:43.120 --> 26:45.560
She just thought, “All right. He need not see me,

26:45.760 --> 26:48.360
but he might see my reflection.”

26:48.600 --> 26:51.720
So she stood before a mirror

26:51.920 --> 26:54.760
and he saw her reflection.

26:54.960 --> 26:57.000
Then he became even more mad

26:57.200 --> 26:59.520
and he said, “I must have this woman.

26:59.720 --> 27:01.680
If you don’t give her to me,

27:01.880 --> 27:04.560
then I’ll destroy all of you.”

27:04.760 --> 27:08.960
Imagine a king doing all this nonsense for a woman –

27:09.160 --> 27:12.000
shows what a useless fellow he was.

27:12.200 --> 27:15.280
So he brought all his army, everything,

27:15.480 --> 27:17.680
and settled down near the fort

27:17.880 --> 27:20.920
where these people were, and sent a message that

27:21.120 --> 27:23.400
“if you don’t send this lady to me,

27:23.600 --> 27:26.080
then I’m going to attack.”

27:26.280 --> 27:30.680
They were not prepared, didn’t know what to do,

27:30.880 --> 27:34.840
so they said that “Let us go and fight him.

27:35.040 --> 27:38.240
We cannot allow our queen to be given to him.

27:38.440 --> 27:41.640
This is a question of our prestige.”

27:42.880 --> 27:47.480
They took a hundred palanquin.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.600
Do you understand palanquin?

27:50.800 --> 27:52.680
They took a hundred palanquin.

27:52.880 --> 27:55.840
And in those hundred palanquins there were four warriors

27:56.040 --> 27:58.400
sitting with these arms and their machines,

27:58.600 --> 28:00.680
and there were two who were carrying them.

28:00.880 --> 28:03.160
And they said, “All right. The queen is coming with her

28:03.360 --> 28:05.560
hundred maids.”

28:05.840 --> 28:10.040
The Muslims that time were, the Muslim king was

28:10.240 --> 28:12.800
having his drinks and things, very happy

28:13.000 --> 28:15.200
that the queen is going to come.

28:15.400 --> 28:18.600
So these people went there

28:18.800 --> 28:22.960
and came out of their palanquins and started fighting.

28:23.160 --> 28:28.320
They had told these women that “In case we win,

28:28.560 --> 28:32.240
by five o’clock in the morning we’ll lit a fire

28:32.440 --> 28:33.360
and you will see the fire,

28:33.560 --> 28:36.160
then you’ll know that we have won the case.

28:36.360 --> 28:41.120
But if we do not win, then you should know

28:41.320 --> 28:45.000
for definite that we have not won the battle.”

28:45.840 --> 28:49.000
They were only, say, four hundred people or six hundred people,

28:49.200 --> 28:51.520
and thousands were with this man and he had

28:51.720 --> 28:54.280
guns and cannons and everything.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.520
So they started fighting.

28:57.720 --> 28:59.480
In that fight

29:00.800 --> 29:05.040
that Muslim king won -

29:05.240 --> 29:08.120
because he had so much of power -

29:09.320 --> 29:13.080
and most of these people died. Even the king was killed.

29:14.000 --> 29:17.400
There was no fire lit at five o’clock,

29:17.800 --> 29:21.240
so these women saw there’s no fire lit.

29:21.840 --> 29:26.080
So they made a huge big platform, a pyre,

29:26.640 --> 29:29.680
they climbed down to the pyre and lit the fire,

29:29.880 --> 29:34.560
and they all died. Three thousand women died,

29:34.760 --> 29:37.840
because they didn’t want other men to touch them.

29:38.040 --> 29:40.480
Any other man coming and touching them

29:40.680 --> 29:42.680
means their chastity is finished.

29:42.880 --> 29:46.600
There are many, many stories of this kind in India.

29:47.160 --> 29:50.680
So, how they respected their chastity!

29:51.480 --> 29:55.520
It’s easy, you see, to fall to some sort of a,

29:55.720 --> 29:57.840
another

29:58.040 --> 30:00.360
temptation,

30:01.640 --> 30:05.040
but if this is your power,

30:05.600 --> 30:07.760
why you should submit yourself

30:07.960 --> 30:10.840
to something which is so useless?

30:11.120 --> 30:14.000
In Sahaja Yoga we have to realize.

30:14.200 --> 30:16.680
Men also must know that if their

30:16.880 --> 30:19.920
wives are so chaste and so good,

30:20.120 --> 30:22.240
they must respect them.

30:22.440 --> 30:26.240
They should also realize that they have also rakhi sisters,

30:26.440 --> 30:29.480
which is that we are very chaste people.

30:29.680 --> 30:33.080
We respect the chastity of a rakhi sister

30:33.480 --> 30:38.680
and we do not want to in any way to comply with anyone

30:38.880 --> 30:41.280
who does not respect the chastity.

30:41.480 --> 30:44.200
Then the men also become chaste.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.360
When the women are chaste men also become chaste.

30:47.560 --> 30:50.840
And this chastity is your main power,

30:51.040 --> 30:56.080
is this chastity is the one is the power of Shri Ganesha.

30:56.280 --> 30:59.160
And when you get this Shri Ganesha’s power,

30:59.360 --> 31:02.920
you know how powerful you become

31:03.120 --> 31:06.800
with the innocence that is awakened within you.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.160
So without the chastity the women cannot achieve

31:10.360 --> 31:14.080
anything in Sahaja Yoga.

31:14.280 --> 31:17.760
One has to give up all the past ideas,

31:17.960 --> 31:22.360
all the past things, and also the way there is bombardment

31:22.560 --> 31:26.920
from the newspapers, from the media, from everything.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.840
Recently I read a beautiful book,

31:29.040 --> 31:34.720
so big as that, has come out that Media Versus America.

31:35.440 --> 31:40.360
In that they have said that how this media has put

31:40.560 --> 31:45.680
ideas into the heads of women and men,

31:45.880 --> 31:51.160
decrying the utility of married life

31:51.480 --> 31:54.360
how they have killed the married life.

31:55.600 --> 31:59.400
They marry, then divorce; they marry, then divorce.

31:59.600 --> 32:02.920
The same thing goes on all the time.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.440
In Sahaja Yoga, of course, it’s not that bad.

32:05.640 --> 32:09.680
We had eighty-six weddings this time. Eighty-six.

32:09.880 --> 32:12.880
Out of which one was about to fizzle out;

32:13.080 --> 32:16.040
that also is established.

32:16.240 --> 32:18.760
In Sahaja Yoga it’s much better.

32:18.960 --> 32:21.680
People understand the importance of married life.

32:21.880 --> 32:26.040
It’s a drama, but also it is tapas,

32:26.240 --> 32:30.960
it is a tapasya with which you understand

32:31.400 --> 32:33.960
your own powers.

32:34.160 --> 32:37.960
I would say a man is like the sun, but

32:38.160 --> 32:41.160
the woman is like the Mother Earth.

32:41.360 --> 32:44.000
The difference is like this:

32:44.200 --> 32:47.160
that the sun shines, gives light,

32:47.360 --> 32:52.200
it gives also nourishment to the Mother Earth in a way;

32:52.960 --> 32:55.240
and the Mother Earth gives everything,

32:55.640 --> 32:57.800
she bears so much of things,

32:59.000 --> 33:01.560
she bears all our sins.

33:01.760 --> 33:06.040
So a housewife is like the Mother Earth.

33:06.240 --> 33:08.680
She gives joy to everyone, to her husband,

33:08.880 --> 33:11.840
to her children. She doesn’t think about herself.

33:12.040 --> 33:16.160
She doesn’t think "how I could achieve great things

33:16.360 --> 33:19.040
through my beauty maybe, through my body,

33:19.240 --> 33:21.560
through my education,

33:21.760 --> 33:25.120
through my

33:25.400 --> 33:28.240
powers that I’ve got" – no, she doesn’t.

33:28.440 --> 33:33.240
What she thinks, "how I can make others powerful,

33:34.320 --> 33:38.440
how I can give them power, how I can help them."

33:38.640 --> 33:43.280
This is the typical

33:43.480 --> 33:46.760
ideology of a woman.

33:46.960 --> 33:51.120
If it is not so, then she’s not a woman.

33:51.680 --> 33:53.960
I mean, she feels – if somebody says,

33:54.160 --> 33:56.000
“I want to come to your house for dinner,”

33:56.200 --> 33:58.600
she feels very happy. “Oh, that’s very good.

33:58.800 --> 34:00.600
Now then, what should I cook? What should I do?”

34:00.800 --> 34:03.560
This is a woman’s attitude.

34:04.800 --> 34:08.000
Once we had a group of people, about twenty-five

34:08.200 --> 34:09.800
of them had come to see Me.

34:10.000 --> 34:12.960
I was sitting with them in an open space,

34:13.160 --> 34:16.080
and then I sent word to My daughter that they are here and

34:16.280 --> 34:19.040
it might be late, so better prepare dinner for them.

34:19.240 --> 34:21.960
After the thing I said, “There dinner is for you, let's go.”

34:22.160 --> 34:24.280
They said, “How?” I said, “All right.”

34:24.480 --> 34:26.400
She was so overjoyed, My daughter.

34:26.600 --> 34:28.400
She had prepared all kinds of things,

34:28.680 --> 34:30.560
her friends also came to help her.

34:30.760 --> 34:33.520
And they were surprised, all these foreigners, that

34:33.720 --> 34:35.880
“How, Mother, she’s so happy about it?

34:36.080 --> 34:40.000
If I tell my wife” – that’s the beginning of Sahaja Yoga –

34:40.200 --> 34:43.080
“that even three persons are coming for dinner,

34:43.280 --> 34:46.240
she’d go round and round and round ...”

34:46.440 --> 34:50.040
I said, “Why?”

34:50.240 --> 34:52.520
“ … and she’d grudge and grumble,

34:52.720 --> 34:56.240
and she’d show all her temper with the people.”

34:57.640 --> 35:00.000
I was quite surprised.

35:02.320 --> 35:05.960
In Sahaja Yoga that’s how we live.

35:06.240 --> 35:09.000
We want to give love, and

35:10.480 --> 35:14.120
men have to appreciate that love and enjoy that love;

35:14.320 --> 35:17.200
whether you are a brother or a husband

35:17.400 --> 35:22.000
or a son, any way, the woman’s love is for you.

35:22.200 --> 35:26.680
And she gives you that love that makes you absolutely,

35:27.600 --> 35:31.360
not only joyous but also religious.

35:32.720 --> 35:35.080
Because it’s a relative thing.

35:35.280 --> 35:37.000
If a woman starts misbehaving,

35:37.200 --> 35:39.360
that’s the worst for the society:

35:39.720 --> 35:41.120
men also start misbehaving.

35:41.320 --> 35:43.440
Men, as it is, are extroverts.

35:43.640 --> 35:45.720
So to control them,

35:45.920 --> 35:48.960
put them as householders,

35:49.160 --> 35:52.840
women must know how to keep them.

35:53.960 --> 35:56.280
It’s not easy to run a house,

35:56.480 --> 35:59.720
it’s not easy to run your family,

36:00.080 --> 36:04.240
it’s not easy to look after your children – very difficult.

36:05.480 --> 36:09.160
And those who have those qualities are the best women

36:09.360 --> 36:12.840
and they really achieve it.

36:13.040 --> 36:16.960
I mean, you can think of your mothers,

36:17.200 --> 36:18.760
how much they loved you,

36:18.960 --> 36:20.840
all the men and the women.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.200
Why? Why do you think of your mother so much?

36:23.400 --> 36:26.640
Because she sacrificed everything,

36:26.840 --> 36:29.880
but without showing that she was sacrificing.

36:30.080 --> 36:33.280
She did so much for you, so you could...

36:34.840 --> 36:39.760
Woman’s potential to love is tremendous,

36:40.920 --> 36:42.640
tremendous!

36:42.840 --> 36:46.040
And this is what we have to learn from Fatima.

36:46.240 --> 36:49.800
She gave Her two children to be killed.

36:50.000 --> 36:54.440
She knew, because She was, after all, Vishnumaya.

36:54.960 --> 36:57.160
She was the incarnation of Vishnumaya.

36:57.360 --> 36:59.120
She knew Her children will be killed,

36:59.320 --> 37:01.200
but still She sent Her children,

37:01.720 --> 37:03.200
“All right. Doesn’t matter.

37:03.400 --> 37:09.000
Even if I know that they are going to die, it’s all right."

37:09.840 --> 37:12.600
Such bravery, such courage,

37:12.800 --> 37:18.120
such understanding of the duty of Her children.

37:18.320 --> 37:22.120
Today we remember them as Hassan and Hussein.

37:22.320 --> 37:25.520
Supposing She had said, “No, no, no, no, don’t go

37:25.720 --> 37:28.800
for the war. Stay at home.”

37:29.720 --> 37:32.800
And if She had forced them not to go,

37:33.000 --> 37:35.120
then they would not have gone.

37:35.320 --> 37:37.840
We would not have talked about them today, isn’t it?

37:38.040 --> 37:40.880
In any case, they would have been dead sometime,

37:41.080 --> 37:45.480
but the death of a hero they got because of their mother.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.600
Of course, they were also a kind of incarnations,

37:48.800 --> 37:53.000
but the way She gave them absolutely complete

37:53.200 --> 37:57.840
encouragement, “Go and fight for the right thing.”

37:58.920 --> 38:01.800
Because these fundamentalists

38:02.000 --> 38:05.280
were trying to bring their fanaticism.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.560
So today is a day I have to tell men also

38:11.760 --> 38:17.040
that you must learn to respect a woman who is chaste.

38:17.800 --> 38:21.520
Please understand, if your wife is a chaste woman,

38:21.720 --> 38:26.800
then you have no right, in no way to trouble her.

38:27.360 --> 38:30.000
Not that she should be respectable

38:30.200 --> 38:32.720
but you should see that everyone respects her,

38:32.920 --> 38:36.160
nobody insults her, should stand by her,

38:36.360 --> 38:38.760
be identified with her.

38:38.960 --> 38:41.560
But if she’s not a chaste woman

38:41.880 --> 38:45.320
and if she is that kind, better keep out.

38:45.760 --> 38:48.760
I do not have that much courage to say that

38:48.960 --> 38:51.440
“All right. Go ahead with her and I’ll look after.”

38:51.640 --> 38:53.280
It’s very difficult.

38:53.480 --> 38:56.920
I don’t know what complications might come.

38:57.120 --> 39:01.680
With all these experiences

39:02.280 --> 39:05.000
one learns one thing for definite,

39:05.200 --> 39:09.520
that woman is much more inward,

39:09.720 --> 39:12.840
she has much more powers,

39:13.040 --> 39:16.720
she is much more wiser than other people are,

39:16.920 --> 39:20.040
if she keeps to her chastity.

39:20.800 --> 39:25.480
That’s the point on which all her

39:25.680 --> 39:30.360
movement rotates, all her personality rotates.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.560
She may be anything.

39:32.760 --> 39:35.600
We had women – like there was a lady who was

39:35.800 --> 39:39.040
only seventeen years of age, and she became a widow.

39:39.240 --> 39:41.960
Widow she became at the age of seventeen,

39:42.160 --> 39:45.520
and she fought a very horrible king called as

39:45.720 --> 39:48.600
Aurangzeb, and she saw to it that he was battled;

39:48.960 --> 39:51.360
her name was Tarabai.

39:51.560 --> 39:54.480
We have women in India of different, different,

39:56.080 --> 39:58.760
say, characters in a way,

39:58.960 --> 40:01.800
fighting in different, different ways,

40:02.000 --> 40:05.360
but they were first and foremost were housewives.

40:06.800 --> 40:10.200
All their powers were there as housewives.

40:10.400 --> 40:13.640
So do not look down upon

40:14.960 --> 40:16.520
the housewife.

40:16.720 --> 40:18.720
When I’m traveling in the plane,

40:18.920 --> 40:20.760
they ask Me, “Mother, what is your profession?”

40:20.960 --> 40:23.200
“Housewife.”

40:23.760 --> 40:25.720
My profession is housewife.

40:25.920 --> 40:29.560
I’m a housewife of a very, very big family.

40:33.280 --> 40:35.760
I’m looking after My children,

40:35.960 --> 40:38.960
I’m loving them, they love Me,

40:39.680 --> 40:45.640
and this profession is the best, I think,

40:45.840 --> 40:49.480
because it is so joy-giving,

40:50.920 --> 40:53.440
it’s so beautiful.

40:53.640 --> 40:55.280
It’s love.

40:55.480 --> 40:58.960
It’s so energy-giving.

41:01.080 --> 41:04.200
And at this age also I never feel My age,

41:04.400 --> 41:08.400
because I am the Mother of so many of you.

41:09.680 --> 41:12.760
And it never comes to My head that I’m old now

41:12.960 --> 41:15.680
and I must do so-and-so, I must take rest

41:15.880 --> 41:19.320
and I must not do this work or that...

41:21.560 --> 41:25.240
Because this feeling of love

41:25.440 --> 41:28.520
for My children: I have to nourish them,

41:28.720 --> 41:30.600
I have to look after them,

41:30.800 --> 41:33.640
because all My powers I have to give them.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.480
I never try to show off My powers to you in any way.

41:38.320 --> 41:41.160
It’s only you, who should imbibe all My powers.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.560
That’s the only desire I have,

41:43.760 --> 41:46.960
that you should be as powerful as Myself.

41:47.600 --> 41:50.480
Of course you discover it that I have powers,

41:50.680 --> 41:53.280
but as far as I am concerned

41:53.600 --> 41:57.040
I want that you should forget as to

41:57.240 --> 42:00.280
what powers I have, but you should yourself

42:00.480 --> 42:02.800
have all these powers within yourself,

42:03.000 --> 42:05.360
so that you can save the world.

42:05.560 --> 42:08.720
That’s the only thing I want to give you.

42:09.240 --> 42:13.000
And I want to assure you that you all can have

42:13.200 --> 42:15.840
everything that I have; only thing if you can retain –

42:16.040 --> 42:20.160
simple thing in life – that we have to be righteous people.

42:21.200 --> 42:25.280
We cannot play about, we cannot misbehave.

42:25.480 --> 42:27.960
Nowadays so many things are coming up,

42:28.160 --> 42:30.640
things that men are doing and women are doing;

42:30.840 --> 42:32.600
we are not.

42:32.880 --> 42:35.200
In the evolutionary process,

42:35.400 --> 42:38.520
as we may say that there were some monkeys - chimpanzees

42:38.720 --> 42:41.800
that became human beings. But no,

42:42.000 --> 42:44.000
in between there were some other human beings

42:44.200 --> 42:47.200
that came in, which vanished.

42:47.720 --> 42:51.040
So, very few people will become Sahaja Yogis,

42:51.240 --> 42:52.160
who will be saved.

42:52.360 --> 42:54.640
All the rest will be not there -

42:54.840 --> 42:57.960
they’ll be neither monkeys nor human beings, finished.

42:59.120 --> 43:02.560
These are all self-destroying things

43:02.880 --> 43:04.720
which kills the family,

43:04.920 --> 43:07.720
which kills the chastity within us,

43:07.920 --> 43:10.840
and then we are left high and dry.

43:11.480 --> 43:14.880
We are nowhere. We have diseases, we have troubles,

43:15.080 --> 43:18.600
we have problems. So be careful,

43:19.560 --> 43:21.240
very, very careful.

43:21.440 --> 43:26.040
And this special puja for

43:26.560 --> 43:28.080
Fatima Bi is

43:28.280 --> 43:29.880
puja of Vishnumaya.

43:30.080 --> 43:33.560
Also the guilt that works on the Left Vishuddhi

43:33.960 --> 43:38.240
can be cured if you develop your chastity.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.680
You’ll never feel guilty,

43:39.880 --> 43:42.040
because that’s such a virtue you have.

43:42.360 --> 43:45.760
In that virtue you will never, never feel guilty,

43:45.960 --> 43:48.840
and you can stand up to any nonsense

43:49.040 --> 43:53.280
because you are standing on the truth of chastity.

43:53.480 --> 43:56.720
Today it’s special day, I would say, when we are

43:56.920 --> 44:03.400
worshipping this great ideal of chastity that is Fatima Bi.

44:03.600 --> 44:06.600
May God bless you.

44:16.760 --> 44:18.800
Right, so now we have very few children …

44:19.880 --> 44:21.280
How many children we have?

44:28.960 --> 44:31.200
Come along, come along, come along.

45:02.720 --> 45:04.880
Let’s sing the Ganesha Stuthi.

45:28.080 --> 45:30.720
All right, you can sing the Ganesha Stuthi.

45:30.920 --> 45:32.160
Let’s say the Ganesha’s mantra,

45:32.360 --> 45:35.000
and then we’ll sing the Ganesha Stuthi,

45:35.200 --> 45:41.120
and after that we’ll have the hundred-and-eight names.

01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:26.160
This stone, feroza, comes from Iraq,

01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:32.000
and Fatima used to wear quartz, no doubt about it.

01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:35.840
This one is called as a quartz;

01:46:36.080 --> 01:46:38.080
it’s called as feroza.

01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:41.680
And full of it, it’s there in Iraq, so many.

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:47.240
She used to wear this feroza, it’s absolutely correct.

01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:22.040
Also this, for your information, ...

01:47:22.240 --> 01:47:24.920
these vases also come from Iraq,

01:47:25.120 --> 01:47:27.640
also from the same place where She was.

01:47:28.960 --> 01:47:31.400
So just see the coincidence,

01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:34.760
exactly, at this time, to come from Iraq.

01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:40.000
May God bless that country and may there be peace.

01:55:19.400 --> 01:55:23.040
There’s another suggestion that everybody cannot

01:55:23.320 --> 01:55:28.760
go to India, so people can’t get married, you see.

01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:32.320
So we’re thinking of also organizing marriages,

01:55:34.160 --> 01:55:37.080
when – during Diwali Puja.

01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:40.880
But you won’t have such a wide choice, that’s the point is.

01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:44.960
Doesn’t matter. Those who want to get married

01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:49.160
should send Me forms filled in,

01:55:49.360 --> 01:55:51.960
and send it to Guido.

01:55:52.160 --> 01:55:58.760
And another thing is that we can’t have

01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.720
the same elaborate way as we have it in India. We try,

01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:06.600
but still you know it’s very difficult.

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.560
It’s a different country.

01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:11.760
We’re trying to find out things

01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:14.840
that can be worked out.

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:17.240
In any case

01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:22.200
we’ll organize the marriages, because you don’t want

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:27.040
another type, ... a simple type, you want to have Indian style.

01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:32.760
So I’ll go to India before Diwali,

01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.440
try to organize things for you.

01:56:35.640 --> 01:56:38.600
May God bless you.

01:58:01.400 --> 01:58:03.760
Thank you very much for everything.

01:58:07.560 --> 01:58:09.960
I’m sorry I couldn’t get presents

01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.320
for all of you - all of you this time.
