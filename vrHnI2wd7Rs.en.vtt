00:00:05.713 --> 00:00:13.975
And there, if you really have proper understanding of 
what I am, Sahasrara should be absolutely clearcut.

00:00:14.062 --> 00:00:18.941
And to keep Sahasrara clearcut you must listen 
to whatever I have told you.

00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:26.229
Obey it as absolutely a ordained thing.

00:00:31.892 --> 00:00:36.399
To keep the Sahasrara clean is to open your heart.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:43.494
If your hearts are not open, how will I fill it up with My love?

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:49.997
Open your heart to your fellow yogis and yoginis.

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:54.080
Don’t get worried about what has happened in the past,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:04.380
don’t get worried about what has happened in
your life as far as your relationships are concerned.

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:10.901
Such things won’t happen now
 in Sahaja Yoga, they cannot happen.

00:01:11.725 --> 00:01:16.386
It has been worked out that way, it cannot happen.

00:01:16.487 --> 00:01:22.777
Open your hearts, that’s the thing I will say.

00:01:22.906 --> 00:01:28.197
Now we have to see what keeps our hearts closed.

00:01:28.197 --> 00:01:38.057
Firstly it keeps our heart in a binding, the fear of the past.

00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:47.749
In the past if you have done anything wrong, in the past we
have had bad experiences of people,

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.627
we are very frightened.

00:01:50.804 --> 00:01:58.332
Because of the ego within yourself: you have 
frightened others, you have tortured others,

00:01:58.412 --> 00:02:06.204
you have dominated others, you have done 
all these things, so there is fear in your mind

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:10.496
that others may do the same thing to you.

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:16.165
Secondly, maybe you might have been
tortured by someone or troubled by someone,

00:02:16.245 --> 00:02:20.864
so your heart is closed, you can’t open heart to others.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.929
People just don’t talk, they just keep “mum.”

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.381
First of all try to trust yourself.

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:32.777
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

00:02:32.977 --> 00:02:37.362
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right so what?”

00:02:37.562 --> 00:02:40.721
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

00:02:40.921 --> 00:02:45.429
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.226
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:54.785
I can improve. I can do better.”

00:02:54.985 --> 00:03:01.363
Some people think that if you trust yourself

00:03:01.563 --> 00:03:04.527
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

00:03:04.727 --> 00:03:08.865
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

00:03:09.065 --> 00:03:16.069
This is a wrong idea. You have to trust yourself by saying that,

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.587
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

00:03:20.787 --> 00:03:23.759
I have been faltering but I can correct.

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.782
I have that strength within me.

00:03:25.982 --> 00:03:27.751
I can rise above all these things.

00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:35.500
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

00:03:39.884 --> 00:03:43.537
Trust yourself. Trust that you are realized souls.

00:03:43.737 --> 00:03:45.737
Trust that God loves you.

00:03:45.837 --> 00:03:50.681
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

00:03:50.982 --> 00:03:54.732
Love yourself.

00:03:57.201 --> 00:04:00.148
You are unique no doubt.

00:04:00.348 --> 00:04:04.742
As it is human beings, every individual is an unique person.

00:04:04.942 --> 00:04:09.033
But after realization

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:12.316
you are definitely unique person.

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.800
how much you feel responsible about yourself

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.534
is the second point.

00:04:20.734 --> 00:04:25.059
How much you are responsible to be there,

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:27.709
to be a cell in the heart.

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:32.605
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.263
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:49.718
and extremely obedient to the Self, to the Spirit.

00:04:52.163 --> 00:04:55.737
It has to activate, work harder when there is need,

00:04:55.937 --> 00:04:59.636
there emergency.

00:04:59.836 --> 00:05:04.695
That it enjoys the most.

00:05:07.054 --> 00:05:14.495
And no impurity should be allowed, the third point now.

00:05:14.695 --> 00:05:22.580
As I told you first is collectivity, secondly your responsibility

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.285
and third point is purity.

00:05:25.485 --> 00:05:29.725
Purity of your own heart first of all,

00:05:29.864 --> 00:05:33.893
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

00:05:35.381 --> 00:05:39.899
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:42.712
Trust others.

00:05:42.912 --> 00:05:48.149
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.630
Trust others.

00:05:53.762 --> 00:05:55.984
Why do you doubt? If you do not doubt yourself,

00:05:56.132 --> 00:05:58.180
you’ll not doubt others.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.104
If your heart is clean,

00:06:00.304 --> 00:06:04.110
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:08.205
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

00:06:08.405 --> 00:06:11.520
such a powerful thing that even a glance

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:16.938
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.559
Purity of heart, actually when the heart becomes impure

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:28.186
the impurity flows down to other places.

00:06:31.272 --> 00:06:33.722
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

00:06:33.922 --> 00:06:37.199
Many people believe that it’s the body

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:40.325
that becomes impure. I think it is the heart,

00:06:40.406 --> 00:06:42.652
which becomes really impure,

00:06:42.733 --> 00:06:45.013
and then it starts trickling down to the body

00:06:45.213 --> 00:06:49.901
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

00:06:53.662 --> 00:06:58.468
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart. Open heart.

00:06:59.269 --> 00:07:01.566
Try to give from your clean heart.

00:07:01.766 --> 00:07:06.321
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:14.159
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

00:07:14.359 --> 00:07:16.565
which Felicity wanted me to discuss,

00:07:16.765 --> 00:07:18.285
is how to clean the heart.

00:07:18.485 --> 00:07:23.660
There is no broom available for that in the supermarket.

00:07:27.107 --> 00:07:32.013
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:44.731
But there is a way.

00:07:44.931 --> 00:07:48.497
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

00:07:48.697 --> 00:07:52.502
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

00:07:53.441 --> 00:07:55.991
I trust you.

00:07:56.191 --> 00:07:58.935
People laugh at Me sometimes. Some of these saints

00:07:59.135 --> 00:08:01.147
who are supposed to be very great people,

00:08:01.347 --> 00:08:03.194
they can’t understand how I trust you.

00:08:03.394 --> 00:08:07.251
They’d say that oh these are all lost races?

00:08:07.451 --> 00:08:11.484
These are horrible people how do you trust them.

00:08:11.884 --> 00:08:14.716
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

00:08:14.916 --> 00:08:17.966
The day you came to me I trusted you.

00:08:18.166 --> 00:08:21.520
And I worked on you from the very first day,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.456
knowing what you are but I trust your Spirit

00:08:26.656 --> 00:08:30.692
that it would shine, in the same way, trust.

00:08:30.892 --> 00:08:35.520
We laugh at others. I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.400
make fun of them when they come to Me.

00:08:41.214 --> 00:08:42.584
Trust them.

00:08:42.784 --> 00:08:47.120
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

00:08:49.057 --> 00:08:53.341
So you have to believe

00:08:53.541 --> 00:09:01.594
in yourself and enjoy the way

00:09:01.794 --> 00:09:06.248
gently you are sweeping

00:09:06.448 --> 00:09:09.539
into the current of your Mother’s love.

00:09:09.739 --> 00:09:13.480
Just enjoy that.

00:09:15.199 --> 00:09:19.975
Like a flower that falls into the current

00:09:20.175 --> 00:09:26.540
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:30.384
In the same way,

00:09:30.584 --> 00:09:33.970
you should enjoy.

00:09:36.517 --> 00:09:42.236
When that enjoyment comes into you, you will start trusting.

00:09:43.142 --> 00:09:45.088
And trust your Mother.

00:09:46.488 --> 00:09:49.436
First trust yourself,

00:09:49.636 --> 00:09:51.921
trust others,

00:09:52.121 --> 00:09:54.714
other Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:54.914 --> 00:09:57.464
Love thy neighbour as thyself. Who is your neighbour?

00:09:57.664 --> 00:10:00.596
He is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:00.796 --> 00:10:03.796
Stand by him.

00:10:09.308 --> 00:10:11.719
And trust your Mother.

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:16.992
As I have trusted you, you have to trust Me,

00:10:19.297 --> 00:10:22.297
and it will work out.

00:10:23.617 --> 00:10:28.277
Open your heart to this trust.

00:10:33.279 --> 00:10:36.798
You should not worry whether it would be

00:10:36.998 --> 00:10:39.331
protocolish all right or not,

00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:45.606
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

00:10:45.806 --> 00:10:48.879
because heart knows. Whatever your heart will do

00:10:49.079 --> 00:10:52.595
in its genuine form will be respectable,

00:10:52.795 --> 00:10:57.993
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

00:10:58.193 --> 00:11:02.243
That will look after you. By outer forms,

00:11:02.443 --> 00:11:06.838
whatever you try is not going to work out.

00:11:07.038 --> 00:11:12.896
It is that trust in your loving heart that is going to work.

00:11:14.063 --> 00:11:19.203
Now I get many letters saying, ‘Mataji, let the love flow from our hearts.’

00:11:19.284 --> 00:11:22.058
Now how am I supposed to do that?

00:11:22.139 --> 00:11:28.987
First open your hearts. I will tell you how to open your hearts

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:36.275
How to open your hearts starts with a small thing.

00:11:36.356 --> 00:11:43.125
Make a list of the people whom you love and whom you hate.

00:11:43.206 --> 00:11:52.553
Then write a loving letter to the ones whom you hate…

00:11:52.733 --> 00:11:57.442
Very difficult thing! Extremely difficult!

00:11:59.776 --> 00:12:06.561
Write to them saying, ‘ I remember you a lot as you are great.’

00:12:06.642 --> 00:12:12.045
It is ok even if they are not, nothing wrong in saying so!

00:12:12.548 --> 00:12:21.161
Then say,’ I will feel very nice if you send an answer to this letter.’ Try it out

00:12:21.261 --> 00:12:26.881
It will work out because the Spirit has made you capable of that love

00:12:26.968 --> 00:12:29.887
There should be no superficiality. He should not feel that ,

00:12:29.967 --> 00:12:33.625
’Oh, today he has sent a good letter
so tomorrow’s is going to be horrible.

00:12:33.706 --> 00:12:37.490
This first letter is an introduction to what will follow! '

00:12:39.071 --> 00:12:44.465
So, you should send a heartfelt letter full of love

00:12:44.546 --> 00:12:50.152
Send to those people whom you hate or feel bad about.

00:12:50.233 --> 00:12:56.367
But start with Sahaja yogis. Firstly, they should be Sahaja yogis

00:12:57.482 --> 00:13:02.982
But you will be surprised that
when you write for the first time,

00:13:03.063 --> 00:13:08.979
there will be at least one line
expressing that anger of the past.

00:13:09.668 --> 00:13:13.983
So write one more, then a third and after a hundred letters,

00:13:14.071 --> 00:13:19.718
there will be at least one letter where this anger is not at all expressed.

00:13:20.382 --> 00:13:24.755
We should open our hearts to the person with whom we are angry.

00:13:24.836 --> 00:13:27.951
We should see, what he did, am I also doing?

00:13:28.038 --> 00:13:31.331
If you have done, then what is the need to be angry?

00:13:31.502 --> 00:13:37.551
If he has behaved like that then I won’t behave in the same way.

00:13:37.632 --> 00:13:40.417
In reality, you must love him.

00:13:41.119 --> 00:13:47.011
In the second part you have to open
your heart.

00:13:47.212 --> 00:13:51.757
So, the sincerity comes from an open heart:

00:13:53.173 --> 00:13:56.634
if your heart is not open, you cannot
be sincere.

00:13:56.835 --> 00:14:02.300
Now, what does it mean that your heart
is not open? Let us see.

00:14:06.117 --> 00:14:11.107
You are born again, you have got
your Realization.

00:14:11.308 --> 00:14:15.374
Also it is your birthday in a way.

00:14:15.575 --> 00:14:22.630
But in the growth of your knowledge
and understanding,

00:14:22.831 --> 00:14:27.397
you have not kept pace with your heart.

00:14:27.603 --> 00:14:33.289
But what is the reason for that? What is it
that keeps your heart like that?

00:14:33.410 --> 00:14:37.401
So, when we say ‘enlarge your heart’,

00:14:38.425 --> 00:14:44.114
it means that the stoniness of your heart
has to be melted away.

00:14:44.315 --> 00:14:51.486
But how does it become stony? We have
to go to the roots of that.

00:14:52.417 --> 00:14:59.971
It becomes like a stone because the heart
controls the brain.

00:15:00.935 --> 00:15:03.990
As there are seven auras on your brain,

00:15:04.191 --> 00:15:08.241
in the same way, there are seven auras
on your heart.

00:15:08.442 --> 00:15:17.227
And all those auras are the ones which
control the auras of the brain.

00:15:19.875 --> 00:15:28.229
Now, on the brain, as you know, there are
two institutions of ego and conditionings,

00:15:28.430 --> 00:15:36.208
which starts pressing the brain too much.
As a result, all these auras get pressed.

00:15:37.689 --> 00:15:41.997
So, the auras which are surrounding
the heart also get pressed.

00:15:42.078 --> 00:15:47.097
So the auras around the heart are
very sensitive

00:15:47.298 --> 00:15:52.732
and they feel: ‘No use throwing light
on the brain’.

00:15:53.353 --> 00:16:01.081
They start becoming smaller and smaller
and that’s how the heart becomes small.

00:16:02.307 --> 00:16:08.144
Because they have no purpose in life there,
so they start becoming smaller and smaller.

00:16:08.345 --> 00:16:10.972
As a result, the heart becomes small.

00:16:11.173 --> 00:16:16.287
You call somebody as very small-hearted
fellow, is a chicken-hearted fellow

00:16:16.488 --> 00:16:21.206
or we always say such a man is
a ‘stone-hearted person’.

00:16:21.407 --> 00:16:24.172
All this happens

00:16:25.226 --> 00:16:29.953
because of the conditionings and the ego
of the human mind

00:16:30.141 --> 00:16:41.142
and the result is felt by the heart
becoming a stone,

00:16:41.363 --> 00:16:46.976
because heart is a sensitive thing.
Brain is not that sensitive.

00:16:47.063 --> 00:16:54.017
So these two conditionings, which actually
are on the brain,

00:16:54.218 --> 00:17:06.400
these two conditions freeze the heart and
also make the domain of heart as zero

00:17:06.601 --> 00:17:10.401
and then the brain starts asserting itself.

00:17:10.482 --> 00:17:14.118
Then the heart just comes back
like a king, returns back

00:17:14.323 --> 00:17:17.856
and starts dominating the brain.

00:17:18.085 --> 00:17:21.594
And when the heart comes back,
you immediately find

00:17:21.795 --> 00:17:23.693
those people with whom we were angry,

00:17:23.894 --> 00:17:27.602
we would not talk, we had nothing to do,
suddenly, we become friendly with them.

00:17:27.803 --> 00:17:34.554
There’s no problem. In many ways,
people have harmed you.

00:17:34.755 --> 00:17:39.734
All that harming and everything just
disappears.

00:17:39.935 --> 00:17:43.781
And you start becoming so nice
and beautiful.

00:17:44.428 --> 00:17:49.360
Sincerity can only come if you raise your Kundalini again and again

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:52.993
and open your Brahmarandhra.

00:17:53.187 --> 00:18:01.579
Then your heart will rise. It will become
a very awakened personality

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.878
and it will take charge of your brain,

00:18:04.059 --> 00:18:07.893
which is all the time thinking, thinking,
thinking, like mad.

00:18:08.114 --> 00:18:11.284
And once that happens, then you will
realize

00:18:11.365 --> 00:18:14.927
that now you have jumped into doubtless
awareness.

00:18:15.574 --> 00:18:21.264
But, as it is, also it’s very easy to get
rid of these two.

00:18:21.465 --> 00:18:24.057
It’s very easy to get rid of these two.

00:18:24.258 --> 00:18:30.231
Only by raising your Kundalini and breaking
your Brahmarandhra.

00:18:30.432 --> 00:18:33.171
This is the greatest achievement that
you have got,

00:18:33.372 --> 00:18:36.047
that you can break your Brahmarandhra,

00:18:36.248 --> 00:18:40.043
make your Kundalini get connected
with the All-pervading Power.

00:18:40.244 --> 00:18:42.357
That’s why I always say you must meditate

00:18:42.558 --> 00:18:46.205
and you must be in thoughtless awareness,
then it works out.

00:18:47.885 --> 00:18:51.914
I hope this will happen this year here

00:18:52.024 --> 00:18:58.748
and people will try to make it a point
that we have a large heart.

00:18:58.949 --> 00:19:02.523
Large heart doesn’t mean stupidity,
doesn’t mean that.

00:19:02.724 --> 00:19:09.714
Large heart means the heart in which
you can put Me in.

00:19:11.373 --> 00:19:15.123
It’s quite a big person, Myself,

00:19:15.324 --> 00:19:19.780
so you have to have a very large heart
that I could reside into your heart.

00:19:19.981 --> 00:19:24.141
That is the large heart and that’s what
you all should have.

00:19:24.342 --> 00:19:28.756
If that happens, then everything
will work out very well.

00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:31.969
So may God bless you!
