00:17.320 --> 00:24.930
I hope your journey has been comfortable so
far and will be comfortable later on, as the

00:24.930 --> 00:27.450
source of comfort is your Spirit.

00:27.450 --> 00:34.710
And more you see to the comfort of your Spirit
the problems of outside comforts drop off.

00:34.710 --> 00:40.960
You are not bothered as to where you live,
where you sleep, what you eat, what you do.

00:40.960 --> 00:49.579
So allow these gross sensitivities to drop
down so that the inner, subtler sensitivities

00:49.579 --> 00:50.579
grow.

00:50.579 --> 00:57.699
That’s why you are here, to get over your
time, conditionings…l mean it is a rat-race,

00:57.699 --> 01:05.020
and the rat race has to be somehow or other
stopped, once and for all, “without”.

01:05.020 --> 01:10.289
So here we can do it “without”, and once
you start meditating, that “within” can

01:10.289 --> 01:19.860
also be achieved and you can achieve that
peace which all human beings should have,

01:19.860 --> 01:23.530
if we have to save this world from complete
destruction.

01:23.530 --> 01:31.770
As you must have realized that now the Sahaja
Yoga is growing much faster, and is taking

01:31.770 --> 01:33.700
a good speed.

01:33.700 --> 01:43.400
And we all have to keep ourselves equipped
to be able to be part and parcel of this great

01:43.400 --> 01:49.420
evolutionary and revolutionary process which
is going to stir up the whole world.

01:49.420 --> 01:55.290
For that, it is important also to see that
we take ourselves to task and don’t get

01:55.290 --> 01:58.360
into mediocre living and mediocre thinking.

01:58.360 --> 02:04.180
We are people of very great potential.

02:04.180 --> 02:09.009
Not only that, but we are blessed by God’s
Divine Power.

02:09.009 --> 02:14.920
Try to use that power within yourself and
try to be one with it.

02:14.920 --> 02:21.910
A little bit, you have to see that you beat
up your body, beat up your mind, beat up your

02:21.910 --> 02:29.609
ego, and chisel it out so that it is beautifully
made, in such a way that you grow into that

02:29.609 --> 02:34.000
image for which you are made.

02:34.000 --> 02:46.040
Regarding other things, like my tours in your
countries; I think, the greatest good is done

02:46.040 --> 02:52.799
to you when you come to ‘this’ country;
as if you belong to this country and you were

02:52.799 --> 02:55.130
uprooted in some other country.

02:55.130 --> 03:01.400
And, when you come here you prosper so well
! And in that country I try so hard, I work

03:01.400 --> 03:06.580
so hard, do all kinds of things, all the time
I spend with you, I do everything, day and

03:06.580 --> 03:18.951
night, all the time—I find it’s impossible
to achieve much, that I see happening to you

03:18.951 --> 03:19.951
here.

03:19.951 --> 03:28.570
As if here you take absolutely with great
ease the divinity of this place.

03:28.570 --> 03:32.609
And I think this uprootedness has to be given
up.

03:32.609 --> 03:39.870
I think as if you had immigrated into those
countries and now you are back in your own!

03:39.870 --> 03:43.919
You are not found out by immigration laws,
I think !

03:43.919 --> 03:51.420
Now, under these circumstances we should change
our tactics and start to establish our ashrams

03:51.420 --> 04:01.120
here, and our own projects here, so that you
people should come down ‘here’ and achieve

04:01.120 --> 04:02.130
more.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.690
You can earn your living there.

04:03.690 --> 04:09.169
But you should come here and spend some time
for two or three months ‘continuously’

04:09.169 --> 04:11.310
and establish yourself and grow.

04:11.310 --> 04:14.700
Because I don’t think it can be achieved
there that good.

04:14.700 --> 04:16.850
Because we’ve tried everything.

04:16.850 --> 04:21.600
So this is the ultimate outcome of our trips
all over.

04:21.600 --> 04:31.300
Despite all kinds of hazardous routes and
hazardous life here, we are doing very well.

04:31.300 --> 04:39.060
I must say when I see you I find you are all
very good and you are very much better and

04:39.060 --> 04:40.380
it’s all improved.

04:40.380 --> 04:46.870
‘Like watches, you see, when you have to
make them immuned, you put them under absurd

04:46.870 --> 04:48.680
conditions and they get alright.

04:48.680 --> 04:57.650
Like that, now you are immuned ! They are
put into troughs which are shaken very thoroughly

04:57.650 --> 05:02.360
as yesterday you were shaken in the buses.

05:02.360 --> 05:06.780
Then they are made to pass through water which
is running very fast on them.

05:06.780 --> 05:12.200
And all this we are trying here; and I think
your immunity is growing very fast to outward

05:12.200 --> 05:20.350
things, and you are becoming really solid
eternal time pieces, the way you are created

05:20.350 --> 05:22.610
here, and I’m so very happy to see the development.

05:22.610 --> 05:26.570
-That’s the main point which we have achieved
here.

05:26.570 --> 05:27.760
So the attention should be.

05:27.760 --> 05:30.010
out-away from money; first of all.

05:30.010 --> 05:31.710
That is one of the biggest problems.

05:31.710 --> 05:36.130
Actually nobody can believe that affluent
countries are much more money-minded than

05:36.130 --> 05:38.250
Indians are, ‘though they are so developed.

05:38.250 --> 05:42.890
You see, the developed countries are ‘much
more’ money minded, than the Indians are-its

05:42.890 --> 05:44.030
very surprising!

05:44.030 --> 05:48.100
When you see the way they count their pennies
it is impossible to believe that these are

05:48.100 --> 05:49.100
really developed people.

05:49.100 --> 05:51.220
They are worse than beggars sometimes.

05:51.220 --> 05:55.530
So that is what you should get out of-the
money part.

05:55.530 --> 05:58.970
Money is horrible stuff that people count.

05:58.970 --> 06:04.890
I mean-it is better to count the names of
God than count the money-horrible coins .

06:04.890 --> 06:09.750
Then we have other things like gross attachment
to comfort.

06:09.750 --> 06:13.030
I don’t think it’s a very comfortable
life there.

06:13.030 --> 06:15.570
Because here you can move in the night, anytime.

06:15.570 --> 06:19.750
You won’t meet anybody who will snatch your
purse or snatch your bangles.

06:19.750 --> 06:23.250
You can move about the way you like and nobody’s
going to bother.

06:23.250 --> 06:28.150
You won’t meet 2 or 3 drunkards beating
each other-nothing of the kind.

06:28.150 --> 06:29.150
So it’s a very pure life here.

06:29.150 --> 06:32.950
That’s a very big achievement.

06:32.950 --> 06:38.530
And the comforts that you want you can create
later on, if you want to have them.

06:38.530 --> 06:43.060
At least I personally think that too much
modernisation won’t suit this place.

06:43.060 --> 06:48.800
So you should not give them these useless
ideas which makes your body slaves to your

06:48.800 --> 06:53.990
own comforts and ideas of enslavement.

06:53.990 --> 07:01.090
In any case personal cleanliness is very good
here, but the general cleanliness has to be

07:01.090 --> 07:02.770
taught to these people.

07:02.770 --> 07:08.740
All this giving and taking process will work
out very well, I’m sure.

07:08.740 --> 07:17.211
And the way things are moving within yourself,
I have great hopes that you will really grow

07:17.211 --> 07:25.180
much faster if you come to this country and
stay here for some time, in a settled way,

07:25.180 --> 07:27.590
and then go back to your countries.

07:27.590 --> 07:35.940
That would be much better than to have a visit
to your countries, which I feel sometimes

07:35.940 --> 07:41.450
is just bombarded by negativity.

07:41.450 --> 07:50.139
The other point which I wanted to tell you
is that you must learn to understand that

07:50.139 --> 07:52.810
you have come here to gain something.

07:52.810 --> 07:55.840
Nobody is going to gain anything out of you.

07:55.840 --> 07:57.460
So you have to gain something here.

07:57.460 --> 08:06.990
You are students and so you have to learn
something, and try to develop a sense of discipline.

08:06.990 --> 08:11.470
Like a disciple who receives all that is around-“What’s
that?

08:11.470 --> 08:12.570
How is it?

08:12.570 --> 08:15.590
This is the house, that’s nice”, you see,
like that.

08:15.590 --> 08:22.190
But if you go on seeing the thing which is
of no importance and loose talking about things

08:22.190 --> 08:24.020
that do not matter with you.

08:24.020 --> 08:25.730
All these have to be given up.

08:25.730 --> 08:32.649
Because you have so much time there that people
sit down and jabber; talk, loose talks, ugly

08:32.649 --> 08:34.320
talks, useless talks.

08:34.320 --> 08:36.639
That’s not needed at all.

08:36.639 --> 08:43.020
On the contrary it’s better to be quiet,
and assimilate more within yourself.

08:43.020 --> 08:47.420
Because here the people don’t have time,
so they can’t talk, they have to work.

08:47.420 --> 08:52.330
But while you have time thereto talk, also
here, so we start like that; and that’s

08:52.330 --> 08:53.810
a ‘very’ wrong thing.

08:53.810 --> 08:58.330
Another talking is done with yourself also,
quite a lot.

08:58.330 --> 09:04.400
like you start analysing, criticising and
finding faults and all the time thinking “Oh,

09:04.400 --> 09:09.060
this could have been better-I’ve harmed
very much here…that has happened”, all

09:09.060 --> 09:11.460
those things come into your heads.

09:11.460 --> 09:17.570
So this kind of a inner talk also should be
stopped; they are called as “murmuring souls”

09:17.570 --> 09:20.750
by Christ, who said “Beware of murmuring
souls”.

09:20.750 --> 09:23.710
But these murmuring souls exist within us.

09:23.710 --> 09:29.200
So beware of them and don’t listen to all
nonsensical talks, and try to keep a good

09:29.200 --> 09:35.700
eye on that and be alert, so it will help
you.

09:35.700 --> 09:41.850
On the whole, I must say that this trip and
the last trip, I am overjoyed and I am ,very’

09:41.850 --> 09:49.990
happy that it has brought forth ‘so many’
possibilities before me and your potential.

09:49.990 --> 09:59.670
I am very happy about it, that somehow, in
this year, we have achieved a new type of

09:59.670 --> 10:09.730
atmosphere among all of you, which is humble,
which is quiet, which is peaceful, which is

10:09.730 --> 10:19.240
absorbing the Divine, which is a very, very
great, joyous thing for me.

10:19.240 --> 10:21.370
So I thank you very much for all that.

10:21.370 --> 10:25.730
I hope you keep up your progress this way.
