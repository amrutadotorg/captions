00:41.623 --> 00:49.433
A new jump has to be taken, Eve Of Easter Puja, Eastbourne, England, 1990-0421

00:49.633 --> 00:53.290
Very nice to see you all here for Easter Puja.

00:53.490 --> 00:58.603
Very nice. Such a pleasure, such a joy.

00:58.803 --> 01:06.803
As if I feel the resurrection working fast.

01:10.240 --> 01:15.080
The year 1990 has come now

01:15.280 --> 01:18.950
as a special year for all of us.

01:19.150 --> 01:22.736
Sahaja Yoga is going to spread very fast, no doubt,

01:22.936 --> 01:30.051
everywhere, all over the world, I know that it has to spread.

01:30.251 --> 01:42.588
And also I told you that a new jump has to be taken

01:42.788 --> 01:47.840
by all the Sahaja Yogis.

01:48.040 --> 01:51.440
To explain it

01:51.640 --> 01:57.290
we'll say that Sahaja Yoga is spreading in a horizontal manner.

01:57.490 --> 02:04.670
The plane is horizontal and you are responsible for that work.

02:04.870 --> 02:09.065
You are working it out, no doubt.

02:09.265 --> 02:12.740
Because of you it has spread.

02:12.940 --> 02:16.661
Some of you have gone all out to work it out,

02:16.861 --> 02:22.220
to spread it to villages, to surrounding places, different countries.

02:22.420 --> 02:26.879
Also the events, world events, have helped us a lot

02:27.079 --> 02:31.410
and Sahaja Yoga has worked in a very big way.

02:31.610 --> 02:38.874
Maybe it will be difficult for us to really balance it out.

02:39.074 --> 02:45.680
But when we move horizontally,

02:45.880 --> 02:57.445
we must also know that we have to move vertically.

02:57.646 --> 03:07.789
Otherwise, what would happen is that we lose in quality.

03:07.990 --> 03:13.160
Quantity maybe quite a lot but we'll lack in quality.

03:13.360 --> 03:16.430
And if the quality goes down,

03:16.630 --> 03:20.870
then you will see many will fritter away.

03:21.070 --> 03:29.839
So we have to look after our vertical ascent which is very important.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.715
If I tell you some of the things that have happened

03:32.915 --> 03:37.670
in this short time after I left India,

03:37.870 --> 03:40.652
I'm myself amazed that

03:40.852 --> 03:48.211
in geometrical proportions, Sahaja Yoga is rising very hard.

03:49.420 --> 03:57.140
But that should not be complete satisfaction.

03:57.341 --> 04:03.651
Individually also we have to rise. And every one of you has to rise.

04:03.852 --> 04:08.749
Vertical ascent has to be achieved by all of you.

04:08.950 --> 04:14.348
Some might have lost a little bit, some might have been a little bit

04:14.549 --> 04:17.780
away from themselves.

04:17.980 --> 04:22.430
The attention might have frittered away quite a lot,

04:22.630 --> 04:27.629
but we have to know why we are here

04:27.830 --> 04:32.918
and then it's very easy.

04:33.840 --> 04:41.170
We are here to be part and parcel of a very good very great revolution.

04:41.370 --> 04:45.906
Can you imagine that we are transforming human beings?

04:46.106 --> 04:48.428
It was never possible.

04:48.637 --> 04:51.742
A-mass transformation is going to take place,

04:51.942 --> 04:54.406
that is how this world is going to change

04:54.606 --> 04:57.909
and you are part and parcel of that.

04:58.110 --> 05:01.480
But when you become part and parcel of that,

05:01.680 --> 05:04.330
you just forget sometimes

05:04.530 --> 05:09.160
that we have many things which are trying to pull us down.

05:09.360 --> 05:12.840
So we are happy to see the spread of Sahaja Yoga,

05:13.040 --> 05:17.736
but we don't see vertically what we are losing.

05:17.937 --> 05:20.527
and that I think is a greater loss,

05:20.727 --> 05:23.551
doesn't matter if there are two persons less or more.

05:23.751 --> 05:34.638
What is important is that we should have very deep Sahaja Yogis,

05:34.839 --> 05:39.589
otherwise Sahaja Yoga will fritter away.

05:45.305 --> 05:50.480
So many events are going to happen and we are on the stage

05:50.680 --> 05:56.089
and we have to cooperate and coordinate and understand.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.905
See now for example to come here,

05:59.106 --> 06:00.901
David had a problem. He said, mother,

06:01.101 --> 06:03.587
it's just like a tempest, it's horrible,

06:03.788 --> 06:07.420
I was there a week back and he was quite upset about it.

06:07.621 --> 06:13.186
Everybody told me about this place, I said, all right let's see.

06:13.387 --> 06:18.438
And yesterday also I'm told it was raining

06:18.638 --> 06:24.139
but in Cambridge it was terrible

06:24.340 --> 06:28.880
and I said, the wind will start and wind will blow on the wind.

06:29.080 --> 06:35.129
All the clouds were blown out and there was clear sky.

06:35.330 --> 06:42.530
So the wind has started in a way and you can see it.

06:42.730 --> 06:47.335
But you must have your feet on the grounds

06:47.536 --> 06:52.100
and this is what I find you people don't realize sometimes

06:52.300 --> 06:55.358
what an important work you are doing.

06:55.559 --> 06:59.426
I mean what an important position you are

06:59.627 --> 07:07.567
and what an achievement

07:07.768 --> 07:17.850
you are going to have yourself and,

07:18.051 --> 07:30.319
and what a great boon you are going to bestow upon human beings.

07:33.709 --> 07:38.339
So when we come out of family life for example,

07:38.539 --> 07:45.447
we have come to Sahaja Yoga giving up all these things,

07:45.648 --> 07:50.077
giving up all these mundane things, clothes, this that, house,

07:50.278 --> 07:55.901
a car, then family life, relationships, everything.

07:56.101 --> 08:02.195
We came here to seek truth and to be one with God.

08:05.969 --> 08:11.399
Not that you have to sort of take to sanyaasa,

08:11.599 --> 08:14.909
but given up means you are detached...

08:15.109 --> 08:18.975
and you are attached to one principle that you have to achieve

08:19.176 --> 08:23.176
Godliness within you.

08:24.708 --> 08:28.228
But when you come to Sahaja Yoga,

08:28.429 --> 08:34.739
I've seen the beauty of Sahaja Yoga, then again you want to go back

08:34.939 --> 08:38.939
to those useless things.

08:39.409 --> 08:43.889
Then you cannot explain why it happens like that.

08:44.089 --> 08:48.323
Like somebody gets married he gets lost with his wife.

08:48.524 --> 08:52.079
He gets a house, he gets lost with the house.

08:52.280 --> 08:55.409
He gets a car, he gets lost with the car.

08:55.616 --> 08:58.566
He gets a job, he gets lost with the job.

08:58.766 --> 09:03.569
He gets a factory, he gets money, he gets lost.

09:03.770 --> 09:07.976
So what have you given up?

09:08.177 --> 09:12.856
The detachment is not there.

09:13.057 --> 09:15.377
When you have known there is no joy now in all these things,

09:15.578 --> 09:18.178
that's why you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

09:18.380 --> 09:24.420
Joy is in one thing is to be connected to the Divine Power.

09:24.620 --> 09:29.897
Not to all these things, these are not important.

09:30.098 --> 09:34.253
Or you didn't come here out of hypocrisy

09:34.454 --> 09:41.880
or you didn't come here for any gains of a mean quality.

09:42.080 --> 09:54.381
You came for a very precious thing, something of supreme value;

09:54.582 --> 10:00.232
giving up all that is so useless.

10:02.000 --> 10:04.705
You are among them, you are there,

10:04.905 --> 10:08.339
but if you get attached to it again,

10:08.540 --> 10:14.940
then you lose lots of your energy and mine too.

10:19.640 --> 10:25.272
So the detachment that you had developed before coming to Sahaja Yoga

10:25.473 --> 10:29.309
should be there. But what I find, once they get into Sahaja Yoga,

10:29.510 --> 10:33.464
they get a job, "Now I'm busy with my job. I can't do anything else"

10:33.665 --> 10:36.101
Another will say, "I have a school to attend to".

10:36.301 --> 10:39.389
"I have got my children". Somebody will say, "It's my wife".

10:39.590 --> 10:42.054
Then some becomes very romantic, they fall in love.

10:42.255 --> 10:46.631
All kinds of nonsense they do.

10:47.960 --> 10:53.759
When you have come in the boat, how can you jump back?

10:56.929 --> 11:03.731
So it's very important to understand that we are Sahaja Yogis.

11:03.932 --> 11:07.335
Nothing can attract us,

11:07.536 --> 11:12.148
nothing can deter us, nothing can take away our attention,

11:12.349 --> 11:18.144
but one thing that we are here for the emancipation of human beings

11:18.345 --> 11:21.847
and that our own character, our own style,

11:22.047 --> 11:26.027
our own personality is going to change it.

11:26.228 --> 11:29.908
I'll give an example of that.

11:30.109 --> 11:33.458
When I was going to Russia for the second time,

11:33.658 --> 11:36.112
in the family they said, "You have been already there, why do you want

11:36.313 --> 11:38.848
to go again, after all, you've been there first

11:39.048 --> 11:42.204
and again you want to go for two three days. I mean a yoga,

11:42.405 --> 11:45.583
a seminar can be looked after by other people who are there".

11:45.783 --> 11:48.829
I said, "No I have to go". But they insisted and then I said,

11:49.030 --> 11:54.510
"You see I have a plan that if I go there,

11:54.710 --> 11:57.347
there will be lots of people from all these countries

11:57.547 --> 12:00.070
which are called as Eastern Bloc

12:00.271 --> 12:03.855
and I think I can break it through Sahaja Yogis,

12:04.055 --> 12:06.407
if they get their realization."

12:06.608 --> 12:12.388
I was just saying that we should get really some remarkable people to come.

12:12.589 --> 12:15.762
And they gave merely 45 minutes to speak to them.

12:15.963 --> 12:20.416
I spoke for about 35 minutes, I should say, or 32 minutes

12:20.617 --> 12:23.963
and I then gave them Realization.

12:24.164 --> 12:28.169
Tremendous people, tremendous personality I touched.

12:28.370 --> 12:32.025
When I went out they all walked with me, nobody was there in the hall

12:32.226 --> 12:36.338
to listen to anybody else. The whole seminar was over.

12:36.538 --> 12:39.347
And they gave me their address, they gave me their phone number,

12:39.547 --> 12:41.839
everything. And they were after me

12:42.039 --> 12:45.779
and I had no paper, pencil; somebody was writing it

12:45.979 --> 12:49.335
And I was very satisfied

12:49.536 --> 12:54.538
I could see clearly in their personality that they are very deep people

12:54.739 --> 12:59.739
As soon as they went back, the Paramchaitanya triggered it

12:59.940 --> 13:04.650
and you know what happened with the Eastern Bloc

13:06.006 --> 13:09.810
Tremendous people there are, they are tremendous people.

13:10.011 --> 13:13.548
Russians are tremendous and these people are tremendous.

13:13.748 --> 13:17.801
Very high quality seekers

13:22.280 --> 13:26.842
Same about Hungary.

13:27.043 --> 13:29.111
Everybody were saying, "what about Hungary, Mother?" before that.

13:29.311 --> 13:33.231
I said," let one come from there".

13:33.432 --> 13:39.839
And really one came quite sick, you know, thinned out sick person.

13:40.040 --> 13:43.139
He got his realization and here it is, Hungary is free.

13:43.339 --> 13:47.252
Same with Romania.

13:49.340 --> 13:51.499
So what is the difference in quality that we are supposed

13:51.699 --> 13:54.834
to become people from free countries,

13:55.035 --> 14:01.411
and those who were in the shackles of communism.

14:03.687 --> 14:07.769
I don't know, but maybe

14:07.970 --> 14:14.459
they must have been great people to be born there perhaps

14:15.065 --> 14:17.764
Because Lenin talked of stateless state and things like that,

14:17.964 --> 14:21.052
but I don't know what to say.

14:21.253 --> 14:24.282
But one thing for definite

14:24.482 --> 14:29.987
they had no time to waste their attention here and there.

14:30.581 --> 14:34.451
No nonsenses of religion, no nonsenses of conditioning,

14:34.652 --> 14:39.142
no nonsenses of all kinds of theories,

14:39.342 --> 14:41.451
no nonsenses of becoming hippies

14:41.652 --> 14:44.931
and no nonsenses of becoming these punks

14:45.131 --> 14:51.360
and this and that and all sorts of nonsense. Nothing.

14:51.560 --> 14:54.281
Of course I don't say that when I went there I found people -

14:54.481 --> 14:59.522
at least 25% who were who are asking for American jeans,

14:59.722 --> 15:02.639
but that's different- only 25%.

15:02.840 --> 15:09.930
The rest of them, just clean plates, absolutely clean plates.

15:10.130 --> 15:13.000
Very nicely combed their hair with oil and all that,

15:13.200 --> 15:16.817
very smart people.

15:17.633 --> 15:23.558
No inhibitions of asking me about themselves

15:23.759 --> 15:28.636
and nothing of the kind. No hypocrisy, nothing.

15:28.836 --> 15:33.359
No fashions. No fashions.

15:35.274 --> 15:42.603
Very straightforward, simple, educated, dignified people.

15:43.543 --> 15:49.239
Nobody walking with funny gestures or anything, very dignified.

15:49.440 --> 15:56.140
They were supposed to be people in the shackles of communism.

15:56.340 --> 15:59.529
And one person has written

15:59.729 --> 16:01.728
the mathematical calculation of Shri Chakra

16:01.928 --> 16:06.158
and he very humbly came to me, sat down, to know all about it.

16:06.359 --> 16:10.528
Their humility was, I can't explain to you

16:10.729 --> 16:13.028
Even to touch the platform

16:13.229 --> 16:16.325
with such humility and discipline they came.

16:16.526 --> 16:19.271
Whatever it is, whatever the regime must have been to them

16:19.472 --> 16:23.979
or whatever it is, they are not abandoned people.

16:24.179 --> 16:28.810
It's a kind of a proper discipline of their mind.

16:29.017 --> 16:36.692
The mind is so receptive, so humble.

16:39.120 --> 16:44.762
In this so-called freedom we have lost quite a lot of ourselves, I think.

16:44.963 --> 16:46.908
First of all experimenting ourselves

16:47.108 --> 16:51.022
with all kinds of nonsense;

16:51.447 --> 16:55.447
talking about things that we should not;

16:55.648 --> 16:58.406
seeing things as in the name of freedom,

16:58.606 --> 17:02.949
which we should never see, as human beings.

17:04.557 --> 17:08.229
Anything people can do in a free country.

17:08.430 --> 17:11.341
I think, unless and until you have Realization,

17:11.541 --> 17:15.902
freedom has no meaning because they get abandoned.

17:16.103 --> 17:19.494
Completely they abandon all their qualities,

17:19.695 --> 17:22.510
all their value systems, everything.

17:22.711 --> 17:28.538
So we come to a point to understand that we have harmed ourselves,

17:28.739 --> 17:32.739
we have harmed our attentions.

17:34.105 --> 17:40.660
First, one thing, that in the family system,

17:40.860 --> 17:44.470
the parents used to be cruel and funny and this and that.

17:44.670 --> 17:46.960
Now you have become Sahaja Yogis,

17:47.160 --> 17:51.280
so now you are so much attached to your children

17:51.480 --> 17:54.970
that it's also not good.

17:55.170 --> 17:59.320
"This is my child, this is my wife, this is my house."

17:59.520 --> 18:02.110
How can it be now?

18:02.310 --> 18:05.380
Now you have become a free bird.

18:05.580 --> 18:12.468
So, today is the Easter day as we are celebrating today.

18:12.669 --> 18:15.651
And Easter time, one has to remember that

18:15.851 --> 18:20.917
now we are free. We are not eggs anymore inside the shell.

18:21.117 --> 18:23.800
We are now birds.

18:24.000 --> 18:27.940
We need not carry the yellow of the egg on our head

18:28.140 --> 18:31.480
to boast about it. Now finished now, that's done.

18:31.680 --> 18:33.758
It's no more there.

18:33.959 --> 18:39.730
So why should we go and try to become eggs again?

18:39.930 --> 18:44.108
What's the wisdom?

18:45.905 --> 18:50.530
And then another shocking thing that I have seen is this that

18:50.730 --> 18:57.313
we have come out of a sense of,

18:57.514 --> 19:04.240
we have come out of sense of dominating others,

19:04.441 --> 19:08.039
intimidating others, making fun of others,

19:08.240 --> 19:14.050
hating others, all these bad things that we had freedom to do,

19:14.250 --> 19:17.200
to talk rudely to others, we have freedom you know,

19:17.400 --> 19:19.990
freedom to hurt.

19:20.190 --> 19:27.240
When we have given up all that, then I find that as Sahaja Yogis,

19:27.441 --> 19:30.549
people are still doing it.

19:30.750 --> 19:34.750
That role is over.

19:35.921 --> 19:40.885
Say now, you were a policeman, but now you have become a priest.

19:41.085 --> 19:44.748
I shouldn't say priest, but what should I say then?

19:44.956 --> 19:47.073
They are equally bad!

19:47.273 --> 19:52.615
I should say, now you have become a Realized soul.

19:56.799 --> 20:01.609
So, now when you have become the Realized soul,

20:01.809 --> 20:05.726
you are the bird, you are the real free bird,

20:05.926 --> 20:11.359
which has got wings, which has got eyes, which can fly,

20:11.559 --> 20:16.408
which does not have those qualities which you had as eggs.

20:16.608 --> 20:20.718
It's completely transformed. It's finished.

20:20.919 --> 20:27.018
It's mythical. You cannot become that now.

20:28.090 --> 20:33.949
If a bird wants to become an egg, it will suffocate and die.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.732
This reverse direction is not possible.

20:37.932 --> 20:41.029
But why?

20:41.237 --> 20:43.795
Why to be in the reverse direction?

20:43.995 --> 20:48.048
You should ask question to ourselves.

20:48.249 --> 20:50.213
We have to ascend.

20:50.414 --> 20:56.179
So in resurrection we have to learn detachment.

20:56.379 --> 20:59.309
It's only mental.

20:59.510 --> 21:05.202
I mean, I don't know how can a bird be attached to an egg.

21:05.403 --> 21:08.562
It could be attached to an egg thinking, "Oh, how cozy I was,

21:08.762 --> 21:13.609
I didn't have to fly". Or something like that could be, you see.

21:13.809 --> 21:16.051
I mean only bad things there are to be an egg

21:16.252 --> 21:18.617
and to think about an egg. But I don't know how

21:18.817 --> 21:23.959
it can be attached or on the contrary it would abhor that life,

21:24.160 --> 21:27.410
"Oh baba, what I was? Where I was?"

21:27.610 --> 21:38.949
In the same way we should also feel

21:39.150 --> 21:47.989
a kind of glory that we are.

21:49.180 --> 21:56.167
But there's no vanity in it, it's a pride.

21:56.368 --> 22:01.930
Is an assumption,

22:02.130 --> 22:06.259
is an acceptance.

22:06.459 --> 22:09.650
You are sitting on a throne.

22:09.850 --> 22:14.569
Now you cannot enjoy a mud, can you?

22:17.500 --> 22:22.644
So when we reverse back, when our mind goes in a reverse direction,

22:22.845 --> 22:26.870
you have to understand that we are slipping out.

22:27.071 --> 22:29.660
That is very important.

22:29.860 --> 22:32.723
My experience of Australia was rather saddening because

22:32.923 --> 22:37.399
I found that it slipped out completely, all of them.

22:37.600 --> 22:42.057
Absolutely slipped out. The leaders were like jailers

22:42.258 --> 22:46.053
and the way they behaved and some of them who joined them

22:46.253 --> 22:50.610
and it was like a regime and it's horrible things,

22:50.811 --> 22:54.189
hitlerish.

22:55.117 --> 22:59.916
So I had to pull them back again onto the boat.

23:00.117 --> 23:04.969
I had to work very hard, very very hard with them.

23:05.170 --> 23:12.248
This is so-called freedom that we have, that has ruined them.

23:12.839 --> 23:19.998
Another miracle took place that I went out to a place called Cairns,

23:20.199 --> 23:25.790
which is a very far fetched place near Equator, at the tip of Australia.

23:25.990 --> 23:31.457
And they told me that the Great Barrier Reef is very close from here

23:31.657 --> 23:37.177
and there are fishes called as Crown thorn.

23:37.377 --> 23:41.198
What do we call them? Crown thorn. What fishes?

23:41.399 --> 23:43.592
Starfishes, starfishes,

23:43.792 --> 23:46.731
and these are eating all those little little animals

23:46.931 --> 23:49.849
that make those beautiful corals there.

23:50.050 --> 23:52.239
And that's when the regeneration has stopped from the 10 years.

23:52.439 --> 23:55.932
God knows from where they have come, shoals of them and shoals of them.

23:56.133 --> 23:59.900
I said, "I would like to go and see this Great Barrier Reef, let's see."

24:00.100 --> 24:05.840
So went down, there was a boat which was to sink halfway, halfway,

24:06.040 --> 24:09.470
we were sitting there and watching everything.

24:09.670 --> 24:12.713
They said you'll see those fishes there.

24:12.913 --> 24:22.190
I saw big big turtles and I saw beautiful, very beautiful fishes

24:22.391 --> 24:28.940
of such varieties, such colors, very gently passing.

24:29.140 --> 24:33.405
But not a single fish that starfish, not a single.

24:33.606 --> 24:37.262
I said,  "let's see, let's see". So we went round and round quite a lot.

24:37.463 --> 24:41.535
Wanted to see one at least, what sort of a thing it is.

24:41.736 --> 24:44.290
Went around the whole thing, not a single thing.

24:44.491 --> 24:49.575
And this happened on the 10th I was there.

24:49.775 --> 24:52.787
On the 17th we were travelling in the plane,

24:52.987 --> 24:55.151
they announced a miracle has happened

24:55.352 --> 24:59.050
that all these fishes have disappeared and

24:59.251 --> 25:02.359
some who were there are dying

25:02.560 --> 25:06.560
Can you imagine?

25:17.816 --> 25:22.512
So what I'm trying to tell you, that you have those eyes,

25:22.712 --> 25:29.979
you have that personality that can trigger all these things.

25:31.410 --> 25:40.269
If 2-3 east German Sahaja Yogis who got realization

25:40.470 --> 25:49.869
can go and trigger, and the Berlin Wall can fall down,

25:50.070 --> 25:55.149
then with all these Sahaja Yogis I don't know what should happen.

26:00.818 --> 26:03.380
That you have, that power you have.

26:03.581 --> 26:08.613
That's why I say that vertical improvement has to be there.

26:08.814 --> 26:13.180
And then let that power act and trigger.

26:13.380 --> 26:19.540
You all can trigger it individually and collectively,

26:19.740 --> 26:24.884
but vertical program is less,

26:25.085 --> 26:29.115
vertical understanding is less.

26:29.767 --> 26:32.939
Any number of Sahaja Yogis we may have,

26:33.139 --> 26:38.615
but if they cannot trigger, then what's the use?

26:40.912 --> 26:42.960
So my request is that,

26:43.161 --> 26:50.771
we have to now pay attention to our vertical movement,

26:50.972 --> 26:54.670
and to our attention.

26:56.921 --> 27:00.029
Same about marriages. I mean sometimes I feel

27:00.229 --> 27:04.825
I don't know why I married them, but they get lost.

27:05.026 --> 27:09.160
Imagine I can't understand.

27:09.360 --> 27:12.311
You marry in Sahaja Yoga, you marry for Sahaja Yoga,

27:12.511 --> 27:15.583
you want to have children who are Sahaja Yogis,

27:15.784 --> 27:20.459
you want to have Realized souls, you want to support Sahaja Yoga,

27:20.659 --> 27:24.969
and that's why you marry and you get lost in marriages.

27:25.170 --> 27:28.060
Somebody comes and ask me, "Mother, there's a very nice job I can get".

27:28.261 --> 27:30.112
"Alright, may God bless you".

27:30.313 --> 27:34.889
The God blessings is lost to Sahaja Yoga though.

27:36.725 --> 27:43.030
So these temptations are there because we are not detached.

27:43.230 --> 27:45.319
So on this great day, I have to tell you

27:45.519 --> 27:47.919
that now we have become birds

27:48.120 --> 27:52.030
and we don't want to be eggs again by any chance.

27:52.230 --> 27:54.940
We're not going to go back to that state

27:55.140 --> 27:58.180
and we have to trigger so many things.

27:58.380 --> 28:03.220
You all have come to England, the whole England should be triggered.

28:03.420 --> 28:05.775
There's another good news I must give you.

28:05.975 --> 28:07.975
I went down to Jaipur.

28:08.176 --> 28:15.840
Only one gentleman from Delhi went down to Jaipur to organize

28:16.041 --> 28:19.240
and Jaipur people said, "it is very difficult you see here, this and that".

28:19.440 --> 28:22.190
He said, "No, I'll have the program in Govindji's mandir,

28:22.391 --> 28:28.327
where nobody can have programme, I'll go and see the maharani".

28:28.543 --> 28:30.580
So, maharani would not meet him, he was insisting,

28:30.780 --> 28:33.876
sitting there, waiting for her, ultimately he got a chance.

28:34.077 --> 28:36.596
He went and talked to her. He showed her my photograph.

28:36.796 --> 28:39.502
Immediately she took to me, she asked about Sahaja Yoga,

28:39.702 --> 28:42.483
"What is Sahaja Yoga?" then she said, "Give me Realization".

28:42.684 --> 28:44.816
She got Realization, the maharaja got Realization.

28:45.017 --> 28:47.348
They said, "Yes, we can have the program here".

28:47.548 --> 28:50.680
She said, "I'll come to the program" She came down herself.

28:50.880 --> 28:53.200
She fell at my feet in the public,

28:53.401 --> 28:56.364
sitting there all the time, her husband sitting there

28:56.565 --> 28:59.298
and somebody offered them some water to drink.

28:59.498 --> 29:01.570
They said, "how can I?" She's the goddess,

29:01.770 --> 29:05.124
I can't drink before her, she sat there.

29:05.325 --> 29:09.269
Imagine, she just got her Realization. What a depth.

29:09.470 --> 29:13.926
But that's not enough. They have one festival called Gangaur.

29:14.127 --> 29:18.468
That is a thing where they worship Gauri.

29:18.669 --> 29:21.769
That's the biggest festival where the queen, maharani,

29:21.970 --> 29:25.346
has to worship the Gangauri. It's is a statue which goes round

29:25.546 --> 29:29.386
the whole of Jaipur State and everybody celebrates it.

29:29.602 --> 29:32.738
It's regarded as the biggest festival. So, she in the morning,

29:32.938 --> 29:35.352
she came and touched my feet and she said,

29:35.553 --> 29:39.965
"Mother, Can I worship you?". I said, "why?"

29:40.165 --> 29:44.099
"Because you are my Gangaur, really, that's just a statue."

29:44.300 --> 29:46.489
She made me stand the same way, she did everything,

29:46.690 --> 29:50.910
She made me eat betel. I don't eat all that, but she said,

29:51.111 --> 29:54.899
"you have to, you are Gangaur, so I you have to eat it."

29:55.100 --> 29:57.763
And she worshiped me and all her whole ritual

29:57.963 --> 30:02.559
she did for about 45 minutes and then she said

30:02.760 --> 30:05.684
"now I'll go and worship that statue." Nobody's allowed to go there.

30:05.885 --> 30:09.502
She took me there, she make Me sit in a very nice place,

30:09.703 --> 30:15.050
like this, decorated.  How much she respected me.

30:15.251 --> 30:20.717
She's, you see, among all the maharajas, Jaipur is the highest

30:20.918 --> 30:23.405
and that maharani is the highest lady.

30:23.605 --> 30:26.070
And they had lots of problems otherwise.

30:26.270 --> 30:30.210
They had lots of problems, now how this happened?

30:30.410 --> 30:33.447
This gentleman got his Realization in Delhi,

30:33.647 --> 30:36.840
I think, three four years back. He comes from Jaipur.

30:37.040 --> 30:39.417
He said,"Mother, we must have something in Jaipur. I said,

30:39.618 --> 30:44.192
"You go this time and try". Very powerful person.

30:44.393 --> 30:46.654
And he went and saw her.

30:46.854 --> 30:49.752
He gave her Realization, he gave Realization to the maharaja,

30:49.953 --> 30:55.123
and they had some case of billions and billions

30:55.324 --> 30:59.405
rupees worth of case in the court, which was not decided,

30:59.606 --> 31:02.079
and they were on the verge of losing it.

31:02.280 --> 31:04.676
But when she got her Realization, within eight days,

31:04.876 --> 31:07.739
that case was decided in their favor

31:07.939 --> 31:13.239
and this she understood is a very good omen.

31:13.447 --> 31:20.338
But just from Realization only, she completely got drenched into Sahaja Yoga.

31:21.990 --> 31:25.780
But she triggered.

31:25.980 --> 31:28.579
So when some people say,"Mother I have still this problem",

31:28.779 --> 31:32.109
then this is you are not triggering it.

31:32.310 --> 31:35.274
You shouldn't have any problem. If you have any problem,

31:35.474 --> 31:40.749
then there's something wrong with you

31:40.950 --> 31:43.990
that must be corrected.

31:44.190 --> 31:46.505
Not only that you are going to solve your problem,

31:46.705 --> 31:50.625
but you are going to trigger out in such a manner that

31:50.825 --> 31:54.444
you are going to solve the problem of all the people,

31:54.645 --> 31:58.138
all the world

31:58.339 --> 32:04.067
Still we have one very big problem of fundamentalism.

32:04.897 --> 32:07.029
We don't have to talk about it, say anything,

32:07.229 --> 32:13.463
just go and stand before them and it will work out, depends on.

32:14.339 --> 32:17.326
You have to do it. If I could do everything

32:17.526 --> 32:20.829
I would not have asked you to come to Sahaja Yoga.

32:21.030 --> 32:24.638
But you came on your own, you've got on your own

32:24.838 --> 32:29.136
and now to stand on your own.

32:29.850 --> 32:36.700
So I feel that our vertical ascent is still very slow

32:36.900 --> 32:46.996
and we still are lost into the web of maya of falling into

32:47.197 --> 32:52.180
a little subtler pattern of our previous lives.

32:52.380 --> 32:55.757
Now we are dead to that life, we are a new person.

32:55.958 --> 32:59.730
Forget it.

32:59.930 --> 33:02.870
There are so many things I can tell you about miracles, for example,

33:03.070 --> 33:07.649
we have cured AIDS now, we have cured AIDS, no doubt.

33:07.850 --> 33:10.047
AIDS can be cured through Sahaja Yoga.

33:10.247 --> 33:12.430
I mean I have cured it, of course.

33:12.630 --> 33:16.020
I don't know if you can cure it, you can.

33:16.220 --> 33:18.480
You can, if you can trigger it out.

33:18.680 --> 33:21.722
But to you other things are more important than Sahaja Yoga

33:21.922 --> 33:25.409
and to develop yourself into Sahaja Yoga,

33:25.610 --> 33:29.610
then you can't.

33:33.650 --> 33:38.630
There was one boy who came in Karnal,

33:38.831 --> 33:41.629
32 years, he could never even speak one word.

33:41.829 --> 33:45.312
He could not hear, he could not speak, not sound from him.

33:45.512 --> 33:50.896
His sound box was dead. And I said two mantras in his ears,

33:51.097 --> 33:57.089
he started speaking nicely. It's all out in the newspapers.

33:58.760 --> 34:04.680
If I could do it, why not you people? Just try.

34:05.620 --> 34:09.649
I've given you all my powers.

34:09.850 --> 34:12.170
They are at your disposal.

34:12.370 --> 34:18.170
But there's one thing, you have to be detached like me.

34:22.030 --> 34:29.419
You have to have concern for each other. Complete detachment.

34:31.930 --> 34:35.487
Let your attention be taken to us.

34:35.688 --> 34:42.147
Still you're worried about this and that, let's forget it.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.719
You are great, no doubt,

34:50.919 --> 34:53.601
but still the limitations you are carrying with you,

34:53.801 --> 34:56.042
you better give them up.

34:56.243 --> 35:01.130
I hope at this time the atmosphere is so good.

35:01.338 --> 35:04.175
I'm very happy this is happening and they want

35:04.375 --> 35:08.115
you to really resurrect,

35:08.316 --> 35:15.338
Resurrect from the sense of time,

35:15.539 --> 35:23.811
sense of aggressiveness,

35:24.012 --> 35:28.012
sense of worldly things.

35:28.510 --> 35:34.340
Mundane useless rubbish they are.

35:34.541 --> 35:38.177
And fly out into the open sky.

35:38.377 --> 35:42.197
May God bless you all.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.521
When you all have your dinner

35:48.721 --> 35:51.621
and then we going to have some music program.

35:54.076 --> 35:57.506
Tomorrow is the puja.

35:57.707 --> 36:03.416
I hope this puja should trigger many things. I hope so.

36:06.101 --> 36:09.825
May God bless you
