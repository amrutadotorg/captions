Public Program, “The Experience of Truth”. South Bank Polytechnic, London (England), 22 June 1984.

00:00:00.234 --> 00:00:03.400
There are in those modern times,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.367
many seekers of Truth [that] are born.

00:00:10.234 --> 00:00:13.167
It’s a special category of people

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:16.467
born in these modern times.

00:00:17.267 --> 00:00:22.200
Perhaps we are not aware that, in every country,

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:27.267
[a] lot of people are born with the seeking.

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:35.534
They are a special category which sees beyond,

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:38.300
tries to find something beyond

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:44.367
what they can perceive through their sense organs.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:51.300
The Truth as we see, is through our sense organs.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.400
For example something we see as white, we call it ‘white’,

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.400
something we feel cool, we call it ‘cool’; something as hot.

00:01:02.267 --> 00:01:06.267
Means, whatever we perceive through our sense organs and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.267
whatever is communicated to us through our central nervous system

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:17.300
we accept as Truth. And we should accept that only as Truth

00:01:19.534 --> 00:01:23.534
and not something that is told to us,

00:01:24.234 --> 00:01:27.234
not something that we have read in the books,

00:01:27.467 --> 00:01:32.467
not something that we can project our mind to and can think about.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.300
That doesn’t mean that I deny any one of the scriptures.

00:01:38.567 --> 00:01:43.500
That doesn’t mean that I deny anything that you have known so far.

00:01:44.067 --> 00:01:48.467
But, to begin with, let us start from

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.667
scratch as they call it or on a clean slate.

00:01:53.167 --> 00:01:56.167
Let us see what is the Truth.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.400
Now in every religion Truth has been described as I can see it.

00:02:04.133 --> 00:02:07.234
Everybody cannot see it. That’s why this problem.

00:02:07.234 --> 00:02:10.300
That’s why fanaticism. That’s why this blindness.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.400
That’s why there are these blind alleys where you end up arguing [about] things.

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:22.167
So there must be something that is missing within us that

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:31.167
we have not been able to really relate Truth to our central nervous system.

00:02:34.567 --> 00:02:38.434
And what is that missing within us we should try to find out.

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:42.167
In all humility we should know that there must be

00:02:42.167 --> 00:02:46.400
something within us. That we have been arguing about so many things.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:49.300
We have been talking about so many things.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.200
Reading so many books.

00:02:52.534 --> 00:02:55.367
Going into all kinds of funny experiences,

00:02:55.367 --> 00:03:02.167
right from alcohol to other drugs and ‘gurus’ and this and that.

00:03:02.234 --> 00:03:08.200
But still we have not felt anything on our central nervous system.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.367
Secondly that we have no control over that Truth, so far.

00:03:15.067 --> 00:03:16.400
So what is the reason?

00:03:17.334 --> 00:03:21.300
Is it that something [is] missing in the human awareness?

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:27.200
Is it that we are lacking something in our human awareness?

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.500
All the books, all the scriptures, which are true scriptures,

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:35.267
have said one thing, that to know the Truth,

00:03:35.367 --> 00:03:37.334
you are to be born again.

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.334
That’s not only in The Bible.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.334
Say, if you take Patanjali which is a very ancient book,

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:49.267
it’s not that the Patanjali asked you to stand on your heads.

00:03:49.267 --> 00:03:52.300
[This understanding] is wrong. It’s just a wee, wee bit of that.

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:56.200
But what Patanjali has written is that

00:03:56.467 --> 00:04:02.267
you have to achieve the Truth on your central nervous system

00:04:02.267 --> 00:04:04.133
through your ‘Atmasakshatkar’.

00:04:04.167 --> 00:04:08.334
The word is different, meaning: ‘the experience of your Spirit.’

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:12.300
Now English language has an advantage and a disadvantage –

00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:17.601
that the Spirit could be the Atma,

00:04:18.234 --> 00:04:21.133
the spirit could be an alcohol,

00:04:21.267 --> 00:04:23.334
or spirit could be a dead body.

00:04:24.167 --> 00:04:27.367
But it could be a disadvantage, because it is not so.

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:35.267
They are three separate things. Absolutely opposite [to] each other.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:40.234
So [that] the Atma, the Spirit, has to be found out,

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:42.300
is said even by Mohammed Sahib.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.400
He said, “You have to become the pir.”

00:04:47.067 --> 00:04:53.634
It’s said by Zoroaster, is said by Lao Tse, is also said by Zen.

00:04:54.434 --> 00:04:57.267
Buddha has said it. Mahavira has said it.

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:00.067
Every one of them has said it.

00:05:00.167 --> 00:05:05.033
So many religions have started in the name of God

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.267
without going to the Truth that – you have to be born again.

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:14.267
Now you have to be born again

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:18.133
does mean that you certify yourself ‘I’m born again’.

00:05:18.267 --> 00:05:21.234
Self-certificate! You can go ahead, “I am a born again!”

00:05:21.234 --> 00:05:25.067
But you don’t become that. What is so special if you are born again?

00:05:25.167 --> 00:05:26.334
What should be so?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.234
The human awareness at this level

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:37.167
is just ready to be born again.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:46.567
As in Sanskrit the word for a ‘bird’ is dwijaha – means born again.

00:05:47.133 --> 00:05:50.234
And also for a Brahmin who is born again.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.100
But those who call themselves Brahmins are not Brahmins.

00:05:54.601 --> 00:05:56.334
They just call themselves Brahmins.

00:05:56.334 --> 00:06:01.601
Have they come to know the Brahma, the All-pervading Power of God.

00:06:02.267 --> 00:06:05.100
Those who say that they are born again

00:06:05.167 --> 00:06:08.167
should feel the All-pervading Power of God around them.

00:06:08.234 --> 00:06:10.300
If they cannot feel it they are not born again.

00:06:10.367 --> 00:06:13.400
So all this self-certificate and deception,

00:06:13.601 --> 00:06:19.300
self-deception and deception of others, is just a money making process.

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.601
So the Truth has to be achieved through your evolutionary process

00:06:24.667 --> 00:06:27.601
which is a living process.

00:06:27.667 --> 00:06:31.067
Again we must understand – living process.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:34.267
Not through just talking [or] mental projections –

00:06:34.267 --> 00:06:36.200
sitting down here we talk about it –

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.367
or by giving you some courses,

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.167
or taking some money from you.

00:06:41.167 --> 00:06:42.367
You cannot get it [like that].

00:06:42.534 --> 00:06:49.267
It’s a state in a living growth,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:54.200
that proves that it is a living thing.

00:06:54.267 --> 00:07:00.367
Means the state of our awareness has to be higher than what it is.

00:07:01.234 --> 00:07:08.100
If our state cannot rise then it is not of any use.

00:07:08.267 --> 00:07:13.300
Like a seed becomes the roots then the bark,

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:21.300
the leaves, the flowers then the fruit – different states.

00:07:22.133 --> 00:07:26.434
In the same way a living religion must give you a different state

00:07:26.434 --> 00:07:30.300
and that living religion is within ourselves.

00:07:31.267 --> 00:07:33.200
Everyone  has that.

00:07:35.067 --> 00:07:39.267
When we go against that living religion within us

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.567
we go into imbalances.

00:07:42.167 --> 00:07:45.267
But even today people can ask, “Why the religion?

00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:47.500
Why should we have a balance? What is the need?

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.234
Let’s go into imbalances!

00:07:50.067 --> 00:07:54.567
I mean, is a quite logical question [that] people can ask.

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.234
Why have the religion in the stomach even? For what?

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.567
So what is the religion – we come to that point –

00:08:02.133 --> 00:08:06.167
is that religion is the valency of human beings.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.167
Just like carbon has four valences human beings have ten valences,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:13.267
which matter does not have.

00:08:14.067 --> 00:08:17.634
Animals have nine, while the human beings have ten valences.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:22.367
And when these ten valences go out of balance

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:27.400
then they go out of the quality of a human being.

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:34.400
But still one can ask, “Why should we have those ten valences?”

00:08:35.534 --> 00:08:38.500
Because you have to ascend.

00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:44.033
Because in the evolutionary process you have to ascend.

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:47.167
And you can never be satisfied with yourself

00:08:47.267 --> 00:08:49.300
unless and until you have achieved it.

00:08:49.367 --> 00:08:51.234
Especially the seekers.

00:08:51.434 --> 00:08:54.634
That’s why I say they are the special category.

00:08:55.167 --> 00:08:58.100
Because, in this special category,

00:08:58.267 --> 00:09:02.167
"men of God will have to become prophets,

00:09:02.300 --> 00:09:05.367
and they will have powers to make others prophets,”

00:09:05.534 --> 00:09:11.601
said by William Blake. In your great country William Blake has said this.

00:09:12.434 --> 00:09:17.400
When is that going to happen? It has to happen today, tonight.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:26.334
But there are barriers within us, built in.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:35.400
Not because of anything else but only because we have been seekers.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:45.167
We have been going to various roads of seeking,

00:09:45.300 --> 00:09:48.133
whatever suited us.

00:09:48.267 --> 00:09:55.300
Wherever we went to, we have tried to find something.

00:09:56.033 --> 00:10:02.267
And we have ensured ourselves within ourselves sometimes.

00:10:02.734 --> 00:10:06.234
We have built up certain barriers.

00:10:08.434 --> 00:10:12.667
Now when you become the prophet

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.033
you actually become your own master.

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.267
You become a free person.

00:10:22.167 --> 00:10:27.534
You have to be a free person. So far you are not.

00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:36.334
You cannot overcome your own weaknesses, your own temptations,

00:10:37.634 --> 00:10:46.400
infatuations, emotional problems, mental worries. Why?

00:10:47.267 --> 00:10:53.033
Because you are still standing in the waves of this turmoil,

00:10:53.267 --> 00:11:05.400
this troubled area where you just see the waves all the time

00:11:05.601 --> 00:11:08.601
and you are frightened of getting drowned.

00:11:08.767 --> 00:11:11.367
But if you somehow or other get out of it

00:11:11.667 --> 00:11:16.267
and get into the boat of your own being,

00:11:16.534 --> 00:11:21.234
then you enjoy, you become the witness, the sakshi.

00:11:21.534 --> 00:11:26.534
Even to understand the scriptures you have to be a free person,

00:11:26.734 --> 00:11:28.667
which you are not.

00:11:29.467 --> 00:11:31.734
You have to be your own master.

00:11:32.267 --> 00:11:34.567
For that you cannot pay.

00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:39.400
I am too free that I cannot accept anything.

00:11:43.167 --> 00:11:46.667
To get your freedom of Spirit you can’t pay

00:11:46.734 --> 00:11:49.300
because money is binding.

00:11:50.267 --> 00:11:53.734
Money has no value in the Divine field!

00:11:54.434 --> 00:12:00.300
Nothing can bring forth this but your own ascent.

00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:05.767
And how do we ascend? Is there anything built within us?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:15.067
So whatever I am telling you today is the knowledge of the roots.

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:21.467
What we see is the knowledge of the tree.

00:12:22.167 --> 00:12:23.734
We see it from outside.

00:12:24.167 --> 00:12:26.167
We see a leaf from outside.

00:12:26.234 --> 00:12:32.234
If you have to treat the leaf we have to go to the roots.

00:12:33.234 --> 00:12:36.267
But from outside, when we see the tree

00:12:36.267 --> 00:12:38.634
we are still outside the tree.

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:43.434
When you have to treat the leaf, you have to go to the roots.

00:12:43.601 --> 00:12:46.400
If you pluck out the leaf, it is dead.

00:12:46.634 --> 00:12:48.400
Then [if] you put it under the microscope

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:52.334
you can go on seeing cells after that you can see the nucleus.

00:12:52.467 --> 00:12:56.167
You can go on analysing it, and analysing it making it dead,

00:12:56.601 --> 00:12:59.467
dead and dead and dead.

00:13:00.167 --> 00:13:03.601
But to treat it you have to go to the roots.

00:13:04.200 --> 00:13:08.133
And this knowledge of roots we have to know.

00:13:08.634 --> 00:13:12.400
There’s nothing wrong in knowing something new.

00:13:15.067 --> 00:13:17.200
These are not new ideas.

00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:22.100
These are ancient ideas. Very ancient ideas.

00:13:22.234 --> 00:13:26.167
In The Bible it is described as The Holy Ghost.

00:13:26.367 --> 00:13:29.167
One priest was asked, I saw, on the television.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:33.267
A very high ranking priest, “What do you know about Holy Ghost?”

00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:35.400
He said, “I am agnostic.”

00:13:36.701 --> 00:13:39.267
So then they said, “Then what are you doing here?”

00:13:39.267 --> 00:13:42.234
He said, “I am doing my job!”

00:13:44.033 --> 00:13:49.267
If that is the attitude towards God, towards your inner knowledge,

00:13:49.467 --> 00:13:51.234
then you can never reach there,

00:13:51.234 --> 00:13:54.701
as you cannot reach the tree through the leaf –

00:13:55.067 --> 00:13:57.267
you have to go to the roots.

00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:03.300
This has been available only to seers

00:14:03.601 --> 00:14:06.267
like, you can say, William Blake.

00:14:06.601 --> 00:14:10.601
Like we had many in other countries.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:14.367
But they did not talk about it because perhaps

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:18.167
that was not the time for people to know.

00:14:21.033 --> 00:14:26.167
But in many languages it is described.

00:14:28.634 --> 00:14:35.133
Now the roots within us, if you can see this (chakra chart),

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.567
are placed in this manner.

00:14:39.167 --> 00:14:44.667
When I went to America the Jungian Society invited me

00:14:44.734 --> 00:14:48.601
to talk to them about the unconscious.

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:50.300
I had never read Jung,

00:14:50.367 --> 00:14:52.267
though I knew he was a realised-soul,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.267
at least he got his realisation at the later time.

00:14:55.534 --> 00:14:57.367
So I said, “Alright let me have one book,

00:14:57.434 --> 00:15:00.734
let me see what is he saying about it, see.”

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:06.734
And as I opened the book I saw a diagram,

00:15:07.701 --> 00:15:10.267
what he had drawn of a human being

00:15:10.267 --> 00:15:13.234
and I said, “That’s the mistake.”

00:15:13.767 --> 00:15:16.467
Because he saw human beings from outside

00:15:16.601 --> 00:15:19.234
and he described them in layers.

00:15:19.467 --> 00:15:25.100
Like first he said is the unconscious that cannot be expressed,

00:15:25.167 --> 00:15:28.400
manifested, then the unconscious that can be manifested,

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:32.167
then he said above that is the sub-conscious.

00:15:32.167 --> 00:15:36.267
And then he said above that is the conscious mind.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:41.701
Then above that is the ego. Like layers, one after another.

00:15:43.634 --> 00:15:49.434
Now when you are sitting here, though you are in layers,

00:15:50.534 --> 00:15:55.467
the path is laid down vertically (the path between the chairs in the hall).

00:15:57.133 --> 00:16:03.500
In the same way within us, God being the greatest organiser,

00:16:04.334 --> 00:16:07.634
He has not made us into layers

00:16:08.100 --> 00:16:11.334
but what he has made us [is] in a parallel way,

00:16:11.367 --> 00:16:14.167
as you can see there very clearly –

00:16:15.334 --> 00:16:18.234
left side and right side.

00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:25.701
Left side and right side [and] the central path.

00:16:26.567 --> 00:16:34.267
Three paths He has made within us for our evolutionary process.

00:16:34.367 --> 00:16:38.167
The central path works out our evolution.

00:16:38.367 --> 00:16:42.200
The left side gives us the desire

00:16:43.167 --> 00:16:47.234
and the right side gives us the power of action.

00:16:48.701 --> 00:16:51.167
These are just the principles I am telling you.

00:16:51.167 --> 00:16:57.434
But you can understand, slowly, when you grow, all the details about it.

00:16:57.734 --> 00:17:02.534
The central path of evolution has brought you, today,

00:17:03.133 --> 00:17:07.167
to this level of human awareness.

00:17:08.367 --> 00:17:17.567
Now beyond that is a very short ascent, which you have to achieve,

00:17:18.067 --> 00:17:21.167
by which you become the Spirit.

00:17:22.033 --> 00:17:27.267
But there has to be some living process for this to happen.

00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:31.601
And what is that living process built within us?

00:17:32.167 --> 00:17:37.300
Is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us in the triangular bone,

00:17:37.367 --> 00:17:41.400
which is called as ‘Kundalini’ in Sanskrit language.

00:17:44.801 --> 00:17:51.100
This exists within us. And you can see with your naked eyes,

00:17:51.167 --> 00:17:54.167
sometimes, in some people, where there is an obstruction

00:17:54.234 --> 00:17:58.400
in the higher centres, it starts pulsating.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:05.234
And when it ascends you can also see it clearly

00:18:05.267 --> 00:18:08.601
in some people when it is obstructed.

00:18:09.100 --> 00:18:15.167
Or through your stethoscope you can feel the percussion –

00:18:15.234 --> 00:18:20.000
which we call as anahatha – up to the top of the head here,

00:18:20.267 --> 00:18:25.734
where it pulsates and then it breaks.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.334
When this breaks the pulsation stops

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:34.167
and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:18:34.234 --> 00:18:38.167
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:42.601
This is the happening and not the Truth.

00:18:43.534 --> 00:18:46.767
In the sense that the happening takes place

00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.500
so that you get connected with the Truth.

00:18:51.167 --> 00:18:55.400
So the connection takes place and you start feeling

00:18:57.167 --> 00:19:01.100
on your fingertips the cool breeze of The Holy Ghost

00:19:01.167 --> 00:19:02.567
which surrounds you.

00:19:03.434 --> 00:19:05.701
Actually, you start feeling it.

00:19:06.367 --> 00:19:10.234
But then as the rational mind it says, “So what?”

00:19:10.634 --> 00:19:13.367
“Now we are feeling the cool breeze – so what?”

00:19:13.667 --> 00:19:19.334
Then one should know that when we have eyes we start seeing,

00:19:19.667 --> 00:19:22.300
when we have ears we start hearing,

00:19:22.567 --> 00:19:27.734
so now we have got new awareness, what is this awareness?

00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:32.434
This is the awareness of collective consciousness, that you become.

00:19:33.167 --> 00:19:36.367
Again I say, “You become!” You are not just certified

00:19:36.367 --> 00:19:38.534
but you become. It’s a question of becoming,

00:19:38.667 --> 00:19:42.167
that you become collectively conscious,

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:47.801
that on your central nervous system you can feel another person,

00:19:48.436 --> 00:19:53.610
you can feel your Self, you can feel your centres which are shown here,

00:19:53.897 --> 00:19:57.378
you can feel the centres of others on your fingertips.

00:19:57.500 --> 00:20:00.300
And the best on this, is Mohammed Sahib, I would say,

00:20:00.367 --> 00:20:02.167
because he has written clearly,

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:06.367
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

00:20:08.921 --> 00:20:11.167
But who talks about the resurrection?

00:20:11.234 --> 00:20:13.400
In nowhere people talk about it.

00:20:13.718 --> 00:20:15.300
They talk about the doomsday.

00:20:15.300 --> 00:20:18.167
Because they can frighten people of the doomsday first,

00:20:18.267 --> 00:20:21.434
and take advantage of it and make money out of it.

00:20:23.167 --> 00:20:28.224
God who has created this Universe, He feels love,

00:20:28.438 --> 00:20:32.234
do you think he will destroy this great creation of His

00:20:32.267 --> 00:20:34.367
without giving us the fruit,

00:20:35.269 --> 00:20:41.133
without letting us know the fruit of his creation?

00:20:43.167 --> 00:20:52.133
He is the wisest of wise, the Greatest Compassionate source of love,

00:20:53.159 --> 00:20:59.371
how could he allow this Universe to be destroyed?

00:20:59.490 --> 00:21:07.458
Especially this Earth, which is a special present from Him.

00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:12.167
So don’t believe in all these stupid ideas of destruction

00:21:12.167 --> 00:21:20.400
and the Last Complete Devastation.

00:21:22.133 --> 00:21:23.984
Still lot of time.

00:21:24.396 --> 00:21:28.234
Let’s first enjoy the blessings of the Divine

00:21:28.267 --> 00:21:30.234
for which He has created you.

00:21:31.300 --> 00:21:34.267
So the experience of Truth has to be felt

00:21:34.267 --> 00:21:37.234
on the central nervous system.

00:21:38.781 --> 00:21:45.984
The problem is not that you will not feel – you will feel it –

00:21:48.167 --> 00:21:53.967
but, as you know, the experience is very slow in the Western countries.

00:21:54.444 --> 00:21:58.267
I am sorry [to say that]. Not that you are in any way less seekers.

00:21:58.300 --> 00:22:01.200
You are very great seekers. I would say you are greater seekers

00:22:01.234 --> 00:22:03.267
than the Indians are, much greater seekers.

00:22:03.706 --> 00:22:09.167
Indians have still to cross lot of steps to come up to your level,

00:22:09.167 --> 00:22:12.234
no doubt. But while coming up to this level,

00:22:12.234 --> 00:22:15.167
you have gathered [a] lot of problems around you,

00:22:15.569 --> 00:22:27.188
and that’s why the seeking sometimes takes time to express itself

00:22:27.564 --> 00:22:31.397
as a fruitful gain of Self-realisation.

00:22:31.667 --> 00:22:34.445
So you will get your realisation, no doubt,

00:22:34.643 --> 00:22:37.133
but again the Kundalini goes down.

00:22:37.234 --> 00:22:41.334
I must tell you very frankly, because I cannot be dishonest with you.

00:22:42.167 --> 00:22:48.355
But it can be brought up by you, by understanding how to work it out.

00:22:48.625 --> 00:22:52.267
By co-operating with yourself,

00:22:53.133 --> 00:22:56.886
by understanding yourself that you are the temple of God

00:22:57.259 --> 00:23:02.367
and that you have to work it out with respect to yourself.

00:23:03.701 --> 00:23:06.568
And you have to give some time.

00:23:07.465 --> 00:23:10.900
I mean, in Caxton Hall, you must have seen,

00:23:11.628 --> 00:23:13.921
I had thousands of people coming to me.

00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:20.133
I have been working in this England for twelve years now, twelve years.

00:23:20.295 --> 00:23:22.367
It’s the last year now.

00:23:23.449 --> 00:23:25.590
There’s a special reason for that.

00:23:25.963 --> 00:23:30.751
But what I find [is that] people get their realisation and then get lost.

00:23:31.100 --> 00:23:33.167
Then when they have some disease or something,

00:23:33.167 --> 00:23:36.367
they’ll telephone to me, “Mother, now I am in the lunatic asylum!”

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.798
or, “I am suffering from cancer.”

00:23:38.965 --> 00:23:42.406
“Now that’s happening to me. Can you help me?”

00:23:42.938 --> 00:23:45.644
It’s too far gone a case [to help].

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:51.300
But if you know how to handle your roots, how to nourish it,

00:23:51.334 --> 00:24:01.682
how to look after it, then you flower out, you bear fruits,

00:24:02.023 --> 00:24:05.267
and by your fruits people know what you are.

00:24:06.505 --> 00:24:10.801
Then you become trees, giant trees, like Boddhi trees,

00:24:11.234 --> 00:24:15.300
and many who come under such trees, get realisation.

00:24:17.843 --> 00:24:21.015
English are a great people no doubt.

00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:25.547
They are placed in a country which is the Heart of the Universe.

00:24:25.928 --> 00:24:27.523
You are very important.

00:24:28.062 --> 00:24:31.167
I have given the maximum time to England,

00:24:31.884 --> 00:24:34.751
you’ll be amazed. Maximum time.

00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:42.300
But the Sahaja Yogis who are not in England

00:24:43.425 --> 00:24:47.013
have grown much faster than in England.

00:24:47.528 --> 00:24:54.267
The reason is, it’s like the foundation that always gets damp here.

00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:02.426
You have to again puncture something inside the foundation,

00:25:02.664 --> 00:25:06.403
remove the dampness. Again it gets damp.

00:25:06.678 --> 00:25:12.512
Rather difficult! But once they are settled

00:25:14.939 --> 00:25:22.200
you will be circulating the Divine interpretation,

00:25:22.225 --> 00:25:25.764
the Divine experience of Truth, all over the world.

00:25:25.819 --> 00:25:30.234
You are at the heart point and this is what you have to do.

00:25:32.267 --> 00:25:38.334
We cannot be mediocres in Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:39.756 --> 00:25:42.656
There is no compromise with your Self.

00:25:42.787 --> 00:25:46.660
You become so powerful that you don’t compromise also.

00:25:46.740 --> 00:25:50.327
You can just get out of everything in no time.

00:25:50.565 --> 00:25:54.605
But you must accept yourself first of all, have faith in yourself.

00:25:54.851 --> 00:25:58.095
Once upon a time the English had too much faith in themselves,

00:25:58.190 --> 00:26:01.835
I mean extraordinarily ‘powerful’ people.

00:26:02.357 --> 00:26:04.882
Now they are the other way around – they have no faith.

00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.267
You see now the sap has come up,

00:26:06.267 --> 00:26:10.234
as if the dampness has come, “Oh, we are good for nothing!”

00:26:10.663 --> 00:26:14.367
This is the second phase that I find in this country –

00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:18.300
it’s complete lethargy. “Oh what can happen?

00:26:18.334 --> 00:26:22.267
Let us be destroyed Mother! Now that’s the best for us!”

00:26:23.267 --> 00:26:26.267
Completely reconciled to our doom.

00:26:27.815 --> 00:26:34.679
And I look at them with great hope. They have to circulate.

00:26:35.584 --> 00:26:40.551
They are the cells, who are lying in the heart,

00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:46.300
who have to pump the heart. Now what am I to do?

00:26:47.267 --> 00:26:50.133
So I have to make a humble request with you:

00:26:50.663 --> 00:26:54.425
that I know the experience of Sahaja Yoga is slow

00:26:54.536 --> 00:27:01.300
but very steady and I am sure that today

00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:05.451
I have got people who are of [a] rare quality of courage.

00:27:05.808 --> 00:27:11.267
An assiduity, which was the English character, once upon a time.

00:27:12.167 --> 00:27:15.350
And that they will take it up seriously:

00:27:15.533 --> 00:27:18.445
their ascent and the ascent of the whole world.

00:27:19.279 --> 00:27:22.246
We’ll be having about three more lectures

00:27:22.398 --> 00:27:25.342
and there I will be telling you more elaborately

00:27:25.628 --> 00:27:30.580
about Kundalini and the chakras and about all this knowledge.

00:27:30.929 --> 00:27:34.881
All this knowledge is available to you now,

00:27:35.167 --> 00:27:39.794
because it’s time was for you to know all the secrets.

00:27:42.601 --> 00:27:44.481
Some newspaper people asked me,

00:27:44.514 --> 00:27:48.167
“Mother have you got your disciples all very great scholars?”

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:50.434
I said, “No, they are all very ordinary people.

00:27:50.768 --> 00:27:54.400
Some may be – who are more difficult –

00:27:56.133 --> 00:28:01.670
but mostly they are very normal, ordinary people.

00:28:02.716 --> 00:28:07.367
Simple people. But what makes you think that way?”

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.255
They said, “They are so scholarly they know so much!”

00:28:10.486 --> 00:28:13.367
Because you become The Knowledge.

00:28:14.869 --> 00:28:17.200
So Truth is the knowledge.

00:28:17.267 --> 00:28:22.250
The rest of it is all mythical, is mythical.

00:28:22.615 --> 00:28:26.781
What do we know about things is all mythical,

00:28:27.027 --> 00:28:31.741
because whatever we see from outside, is outside.

00:28:32.133 --> 00:28:37.664
Like, I would say, we appreciate Mona Lisa,

00:28:38.981 --> 00:28:43.680
we appreciate the miracles as we say,

00:28:43.926 --> 00:28:48.727
the great miracles that human beings have created. Why?

00:28:49.437 --> 00:28:51.504
Why do we call them miracles?

00:28:52.533 --> 00:28:56.267
Sometimes we think that, maybe because it’s a very miraculous task,

00:28:56.267 --> 00:29:01.100
they have done – mentally we think – but actually it is not so.

00:29:03.167 --> 00:29:08.234
Because they have vibrations, they have Divine vibrations,

00:29:08.267 --> 00:29:12.100
they emit vibrations and they appeal to you

00:29:12.167 --> 00:29:16.848
because in your heart lies that Spirit which is the Universal Being

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:22.234
and which gives that feeling of bewilderment

00:29:23.663 --> 00:29:30.663
when you see these great miracles that human beings have created.

00:29:31.552 --> 00:29:33.585
At least I have seen six of them,

00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.767
and all of them have tremendous vibrations.

00:29:36.901 --> 00:29:41.877
But unless and until you become a realised-soul, how will you know?

00:29:46.401 --> 00:29:48.567
Now this is the only gap.

00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:53.297
And to become the realised-soul you have to have

00:29:53.631 --> 00:29:59.481
the ascent of the Kundalini and the proper state

00:29:59.806 --> 00:30:02.639
of that Kundalini to remain there.

00:30:02.981 --> 00:30:08.947
And that’s the point where I found we lack in efforts,

00:30:13.457 --> 00:30:16.524
lack in courage, in patience.

00:30:17.100 --> 00:30:23.400
So again and again I request you that – don’t be superficial.

00:30:24.159 --> 00:30:27.434
Let Americans be superficial. You’d better not be.

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:34.409
You be solid people, serious. Take it up seriously!

00:30:34.528 --> 00:30:39.167
Because you are going to lead the Europeans, the Americans,

00:30:39.931 --> 00:30:42.898
even the Greeks, even the Italians.

00:30:43.167 --> 00:30:46.900
The problem is the horse is behind the cart!

00:30:48.167 --> 00:30:52.944
Sitting lethargically. Now what am I to do to the horse?

00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.167
That, “You get up now! Because of you the cart is not moving.”

00:30:57.786 --> 00:31:01.857
That’s why I make a very, very special request to you all,

00:31:02.267 --> 00:31:06.300
that you must decide that – if we get our Realisation,

00:31:06.334 --> 00:31:09.167
we’ll establish ourselves into Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:09.267 --> 00:31:12.267
For which you don’t have to pay, there’s no membership,

00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:15.200
there’s no organisation. Nothing.

00:31:20.977 --> 00:31:28.859
I have nothing to take from you. You can’t give me anything.

00:31:33.441 --> 00:31:38.267
So I hope today, many who are new will get their Realisation

00:31:38.354 --> 00:31:42.259
and establish themselves and will not forget it.

00:31:42.536 --> 00:31:45.267
Because in the beginning the experience is very great,

00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.267
you feel as if you are coming out of a pub!

00:31:50.267 --> 00:31:54.400
I don’t know what that experience is! Must be terrific! (laughter)

00:31:56.173 --> 00:31:59.267
Because I see so many people coming and falling down

00:31:59.267 --> 00:32:03.314
and again so many going in. So I used to wonder, “How is it?”

00:32:04.132 --> 00:32:08.513
Must be some memory of something great, must be there!

00:32:12.377 --> 00:32:19.344
So by God’s grace you should all get your Realisation

00:32:20.167 --> 00:32:23.167
and I would like to have some questions,

00:32:23.350 --> 00:32:27.676
but in that I would like to say that there are people I know,

00:32:27.962 --> 00:32:31.267
we've had before also, belonged to some gurus or something,

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:33.315
paid by some gurus have come.

00:32:33.482 --> 00:32:38.498
Because the gurus are feeling that I am, in a way, attacking them.

00:32:38.665 --> 00:32:42.768
In a way, they feel that way because I say you cannot pay –

00:32:43.093 --> 00:32:46.167
so all their profession is finished! (laughter)

00:32:47.593 --> 00:32:49.593
So they get angry with me for that.

00:32:49.730 --> 00:32:52.904
So they might  be saying, “Ah, you go and attack Her.”

00:32:52.929 --> 00:32:55.135
And all sorts of things.

00:32:55.506 --> 00:33:00.373
And there could be some people who are aggressive because of

00:33:01.530 --> 00:33:04.464
other problems of ego or something.

00:33:04.879 --> 00:33:06.300
So you need not be aggressive.

00:33:06.300 --> 00:33:09.450
I have come here to give you what you have.

00:33:10.046 --> 00:33:15.267
And you need not be also docile about it or slavish.

00:33:16.100 --> 00:33:23.167
I have come here to give you or tell you, what is freedom.

00:33:23.916 --> 00:33:28.916
Now you may also say, which is a very common question arising in your mind –

00:33:29.167 --> 00:33:31.876
and justifiable – that why should I do it.

00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:36.200
Now that’s the miserable part of it, that I have to do it.

00:33:36.755 --> 00:33:41.169
I wish you could do it – but you can’t – that’s the trouble.

00:33:42.034 --> 00:33:45.811
And if I have to do it, I don’t hurt your ego.

00:33:46.338 --> 00:33:49.338
No, I don’t want to hurt you.

00:33:50.234 --> 00:33:54.409
You see this is something people don’t understand

00:33:54.631 --> 00:33:57.200
that why should I do it?

00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:04.292
You can do it also but first I’ll have to take you a little bit ahead,

00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:07.609
your awareness has to grow a little more.

00:34:07.784 --> 00:34:09.791
And then you can do it on your own.

00:34:10.234 --> 00:34:14.275
But first definitely, I have to do that.

00:34:14.474 --> 00:34:16.133
Which is a headache [for me]. I tell you,

00:34:16.133 --> 00:34:18.167
it makes me also a miserable person

00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:21.577
because, you know, this is something a thankless job of a Mother.

00:34:22.385 --> 00:34:24.285
But I have to do it.

00:34:24.552 --> 00:34:28.400
Maybe I am paid for it somehow! I don’t know.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:34.667
Whichever way it is. But you shouldn’t feel hurt about it!

00:34:36.622 --> 00:34:41.456
It’s a crucifixion, I tell you. It’s not easy.

00:34:41.638 --> 00:34:45.133
It’s a very difficult task. It’s like [lifting] mountains sometimes.

00:34:45.167 --> 00:34:49.914
The Kundalini is just embedded, poor thing, sometimes so hurt,

00:34:50.167 --> 00:34:54.167
so wounded that to raise that wounded Kundalini, itself,

00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:57.930
takes such a lot of effort.

00:35:00.248 --> 00:35:05.065
But one has to do it and I knew I have to do it.

00:35:07.330 --> 00:35:12.695
When you will know what it is you will not be angry with me,

00:35:13.498 --> 00:35:17.536
but you will understand the task ahead of us, all of us.

00:35:17.819 --> 00:35:19.852
All of us have to do it.

00:35:23.300 --> 00:35:25.267
May God bless you all.

00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:34.524
Now, as this is the first programme, I would like to have questions.

00:35:34.762 --> 00:35:39.906
But sensible questions which will help everyone to ascend.

00:35:40.367 --> 00:35:42.500
It should not be ‘dog in the manger’ policy –

00:35:43.133 --> 00:35:45.601
that you don’t want to ascend? Alright, goodbye!

00:35:45.601 --> 00:35:49.234
We cannot force. Actually we cannot force you.

00:35:50.367 --> 00:35:54.100
It has to be asked for otherwise I cannot do it.

00:35:54.601 --> 00:35:59.234
You have to knock at the door otherwise [the] door cannot be opened.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:03.601
So those who do not want it should not bother to ask me questions.

00:36:03.634 --> 00:36:05.534
I have seen mostly the people who ask me the questions

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.367
are the first to go away.

00:36:08.846 --> 00:36:11.077
So, this is not meant for such people.

00:36:11.546 --> 00:36:17.704
I mean, for that you can join, say miner’s strike or something like that.

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:20.214
(Laughter) (There was a big coal miner’s strike in UK in 1984).

00:36:20.334 --> 00:36:24.200
But this is not the place for such people who want to fight it out.

00:36:24.434 --> 00:36:27.500
It is something that’s so beautiful,

00:36:27.667 --> 00:36:31.200
that is your own, which has to be opened out.

00:36:33.267 --> 00:36:36.367
So you can ask me questions will be a good idea.

00:36:38.267 --> 00:36:40.133
Thank you very much.

00:36:40.601 --> 00:36:45.267
(nobody asks any questions)

00:36:53.367 --> 00:36:57.434
That doesn’t mean you should not ask me questions (laughter).

00:36:57.434 --> 00:37:01.300
You shouldn’t be frightened. You should ask, you must.

00:37:12.601 --> 00:37:18.367
No questions at all ? Now, I’ll ask one question.

00:37:18.434 --> 00:37:22.300
How many are new people to Sahaja Yoga? Absolutely new.

00:37:22.529 --> 00:37:24.595
Please raise your hands, please.

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:30.806
Can I request you to come in the front two rows, all of you, please.

00:37:31.234 --> 00:37:33.710
If you don’t mind. [It] will be a better idea.

00:37:33.805 --> 00:37:36.813
Because I want to look after you. Please.

00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:47.100
Front two rows you can occupy. Front rows you can occupy.

00:38:01.234 --> 00:38:02.400
Please.

00:38:27.167 --> 00:38:33.889
Now it is a very collective working, extremely collective.

00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:39.322
See, like this finger has some pain so the other hand comes round

00:38:39.465 --> 00:38:42.200
and presses it and puts it right. Alright ?

00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.100
So we are all part and parcel of One Being.

00:38:46.367 --> 00:38:57.567
As you call them, the microcosm and the macrocosm.

00:38:59.234 --> 00:39:02.567
And only thing [is] the ones which are awakened

00:39:02.773 --> 00:39:05.133
will help to awaken the rest of it.

00:39:05.267 --> 00:39:08.979
That doesn’t mean anybody is superior or higher or lower.

00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.500
There is no obligation.

00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:14.133
Like my own finger paining if I try to rub it,

00:39:14.234 --> 00:39:22.267
am I obliging that finger? No, I am not. Because I can’t live without that.

00:39:22.612 --> 00:39:27.351
I can’t bear the pain. And this is me, and this is me too.

00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:29.351
In the same way it works out.

00:39:29.501 --> 00:39:34.267
So we’ll try to work it out and, when it works out,

00:39:34.367 --> 00:39:39.575
some of the Sahaja Yogis will come and see what the situation is,

00:39:39.694 --> 00:39:44.334
what are the centres in trouble. Nobody should feel bad about it.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:48.621
With all respect to you it will be done.

00:39:48.812 --> 00:39:53.367
So one should not feel bad or sad about it [or] in anyway hurt.

00:39:53.467 --> 00:40:02.367
Why I am saying so [is] because, you see sometimes people feel

00:40:02.426 --> 00:40:08.159
that they are challenged. They feel that way. You should not.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.053
It’s for your good, for your health.

00:40:11.267 --> 00:40:14.434
So, I am just trying to tell you as a mother would say that,

00:40:14.567 --> 00:40:19.634
“It’s alright, you see, and there’s nothing wrong with you.”

00:40:19.634 --> 00:40:21.424
So, don’t be frightened of anyone.

00:40:21.567 --> 00:40:23.200
Don’t be angry with anyone.

00:40:23.241 --> 00:40:26.676
Specially with yourself don’t be angry and it will all work out.

00:40:26.922 --> 00:40:29.601
Now, another thing I have to request is to take out your shoes

00:40:29.601 --> 00:40:33.234
for one reason that this Mother Earth helps us a lot

00:40:33.334 --> 00:40:35.534
and if you take out your shoes the Mother Earth,

00:40:35.601 --> 00:40:40.634
you see, for earthing’s sake, it is better to take out.

00:40:43.276 --> 00:40:47.926
Everything is so much artificial that it’s impossible

00:40:48.025 --> 00:40:50.758
to reach the Mother Earth somehow.

00:40:51.100 --> 00:40:53.846
Alright. Put both the feet straight like this.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.267
It helps that’s why. Just to help.

00:40:56.434 --> 00:41:00.467
And sit in such a way that your back is straight.

00:41:01.300 --> 00:41:05.601
Not too much of like this, forward, or bent.

00:41:05.634 --> 00:41:08.400
But in a straight way, in a simple manner.

00:41:08.516 --> 00:41:12.833
‘Sahaj’ also means ‘a simple way, spontaneous.’

00:41:13.055 --> 00:41:16.055
As you sit, spontaneously.
