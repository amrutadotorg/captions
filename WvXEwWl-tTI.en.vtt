00:00.000 --> 00:00.067
Public Program, “The Experience of Truth”. South Bank Polytechnic, London (England), 22 June 1984.

00:00.234 --> 00:03.400
There are in those modern times,

00:05.400 --> 00:09.367
many seekers of Truth [that] are born.

00:10.234 --> 00:13.167
It’s a special category of people

00:13.567 --> 00:16.467
born in these modern times.

00:17.267 --> 00:22.200
Perhaps we are not aware that, in every country,

00:23.467 --> 00:27.267
[a] lot of people are born with the seeking.

00:28.267 --> 00:35.534
They are a special category which sees beyond,

00:36.133 --> 00:38.300
tries to find something beyond

00:38.601 --> 00:44.367
what they can perceive through their sense organs.

00:46.167 --> 00:51.300
The Truth as we see, is through our sense organs.

00:51.400 --> 00:55.400
For example something we see as white, we call it ‘white’,

00:56.200 --> 01:01.400
something we feel cool, we call it ‘cool’; something as hot.

01:02.267 --> 01:06.267
Means, whatever we perceive through our sense organs and

01:07.100 --> 01:12.267
whatever is communicated to us through our central nervous system

01:12.400 --> 01:17.300
we accept as Truth. And we should accept that only as Truth

01:19.534 --> 01:23.534
and not something that is told to us,

01:24.234 --> 01:27.234
not something that we have read in the books,

01:27.467 --> 01:32.467
not something that we can project our mind to and can think about.

01:33.400 --> 01:38.300
That doesn’t mean that I deny any one of the scriptures.

01:38.567 --> 01:43.500
That doesn’t mean that I deny anything that you have known so far.

01:44.067 --> 01:48.467
But, to begin with, let us start from

01:49.300 --> 01:52.667
scratch as they call it or on a clean slate.

01:53.167 --> 01:56.167
Let us see what is the Truth.

01:57.500 --> 02:03.400
Now in every religion Truth has been described as I can see it.

02:04.133 --> 02:07.234
Everybody cannot see it. That’s why this problem.

02:07.234 --> 02:10.300
That’s why fanaticism. That’s why this blindness.

02:10.300 --> 02:16.400
That’s why there are these blind alleys where you end up arguing [about] things.

02:18.267 --> 02:22.167
So there must be something that is missing within us that

02:22.200 --> 02:31.167
we have not been able to really relate Truth to our central nervous system.

02:34.567 --> 02:38.434
And what is that missing within us we should try to find out.

02:39.167 --> 02:42.167
In all humility we should know that there must be

02:42.167 --> 02:46.400
something within us. That we have been arguing about so many things.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.300
We have been talking about so many things.

02:49.300 --> 02:52.200
Reading so many books.

02:52.534 --> 02:55.367
Going into all kinds of funny experiences,

02:55.367 --> 03:02.167
right from alcohol to other drugs and ‘gurus’ and this and that.

03:02.234 --> 03:08.200
But still we have not felt anything on our central nervous system.

03:09.100 --> 03:14.367
Secondly that we have no control over that Truth, so far.

03:15.067 --> 03:16.400
So what is the reason?

03:17.334 --> 03:21.300
Is it that something [is] missing in the human awareness?

03:22.400 --> 03:27.200
Is it that we are lacking something in our human awareness?

03:28.033 --> 03:31.500
All the books, all the scriptures, which are true scriptures,

03:32.033 --> 03:35.267
have said one thing, that to know the Truth,

03:35.367 --> 03:37.334
you are to be born again.

03:37.567 --> 03:40.334
That’s not only in The Bible.

03:41.300 --> 03:45.334
Say, if you take Patanjali which is a very ancient book,

03:46.133 --> 03:49.267
it’s not that the Patanjali asked you to stand on your heads.

03:49.267 --> 03:52.300
[This understanding] is wrong. It’s just a wee, wee bit of that.

03:53.133 --> 03:56.200
But what Patanjali has written is that

03:56.467 --> 04:02.267
you have to achieve the Truth on your central nervous system

04:02.267 --> 04:04.133
through your ‘Atmasakshatkar’.

04:04.167 --> 04:08.334
The word is different, meaning: ‘the experience of your Spirit.’

04:09.167 --> 04:12.300
Now English language has an advantage and a disadvantage –

04:12.601 --> 04:17.601
that the Spirit could be the Atma,

04:18.234 --> 04:21.133
the spirit could be an alcohol,

04:21.267 --> 04:23.334
or spirit could be a dead body.

04:24.167 --> 04:27.367
But it could be a disadvantage, because it is not so.

04:27.467 --> 04:35.267
They are three separate things. Absolutely opposite [to] each other.

04:36.300 --> 04:40.234
So [that] the Atma, the Spirit, has to be found out,

04:40.267 --> 04:42.300
is said even by Mohammed Sahib.

04:42.300 --> 04:44.400
He said, “You have to become the pir.”

04:47.067 --> 04:53.634
It’s said by Zoroaster, is said by Lao Tse, is also said by Zen.

04:54.434 --> 04:57.267
Buddha has said it. Mahavira has said it.

04:57.467 --> 05:00.067
Every one of them has said it.

05:00.167 --> 05:05.033
So many religions have started in the name of God

05:05.200 --> 05:10.267
without going to the Truth that – you have to be born again.

05:12.067 --> 05:14.267
Now you have to be born again

05:14.334 --> 05:18.133
does mean that you certify yourself ‘I’m born again’.

05:18.267 --> 05:21.234
Self-certificate! You can go ahead, “I am a born again!”

05:21.234 --> 05:25.067
But you don’t become that. What is so special if you are born again?

05:25.167 --> 05:26.334
What should be so?

05:30.000 --> 05:32.234
The human awareness at this level

05:32.300 --> 05:37.167
is just ready to be born again.

05:38.400 --> 05:46.567
As in Sanskrit the word for a ‘bird’ is dwijaha – means born again.

05:47.133 --> 05:50.234
And also for a Brahmin who is born again.

05:50.400 --> 05:54.100
But those who call themselves Brahmins are not Brahmins.

05:54.601 --> 05:56.334
They just call themselves Brahmins.

05:56.334 --> 06:01.601
Have they come to know the Brahma, the All-pervading Power of God.

06:02.267 --> 06:05.100
Those who say that they are born again

06:05.167 --> 06:08.167
should feel the All-pervading Power of God around them.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.300
If they cannot feel it they are not born again.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.400
So all this self-certificate and deception,

06:13.601 --> 06:19.300
self-deception and deception of others, is just a money making process.

06:20.200 --> 06:24.601
So the Truth has to be achieved through your evolutionary process

06:24.667 --> 06:27.601
which is a living process.

06:27.667 --> 06:31.067
Again we must understand – living process.

06:31.500 --> 06:34.267
Not through just talking [or] mental projections –

06:34.267 --> 06:36.200
sitting down here we talk about it –

06:36.300 --> 06:38.367
or by giving you some courses,

06:39.000 --> 06:41.167
or taking some money from you.

06:41.167 --> 06:42.367
You cannot get it [like that].

06:42.534 --> 06:49.267
It’s a state in a living growth,

06:50.500 --> 06:54.200
that proves that it is a living thing.

06:54.267 --> 07:00.367
Means the state of our awareness has to be higher than what it is.

07:01.234 --> 07:08.100
If our state cannot rise then it is not of any use.

07:08.267 --> 07:13.300
Like a seed becomes the roots then the bark,

07:15.234 --> 07:21.300
the leaves, the flowers then the fruit – different states.

07:22.133 --> 07:26.434
In the same way a living religion must give you a different state

07:26.434 --> 07:30.300
and that living religion is within ourselves.

07:31.267 --> 07:33.200
Everyone  has that.

07:35.067 --> 07:39.267
When we go against that living religion within us

07:39.500 --> 07:41.567
we go into imbalances.

07:42.167 --> 07:45.267
But even today people can ask, “Why the religion?

07:45.367 --> 07:47.500
Why should we have a balance? What is the need?

07:47.500 --> 07:49.234
Let’s go into imbalances!

07:50.067 --> 07:54.567
I mean, is a quite logical question [that] people can ask.

07:55.000 --> 07:59.234
Why have the religion in the stomach even? For what?

07:59.400 --> 08:01.567
So what is the religion – we come to that point –

08:02.133 --> 08:06.167
is that religion is the valency of human beings.

08:06.400 --> 08:11.167
Just like carbon has four valences human beings have ten valences,

08:11.200 --> 08:13.267
which matter does not have.

08:14.067 --> 08:17.634
Animals have nine, while the human beings have ten valences.

08:18.200 --> 08:22.367
And when these ten valences go out of balance

08:23.200 --> 08:27.400
then they go out of the quality of a human being.

08:28.300 --> 08:34.400
But still one can ask, “Why should we have those ten valences?”

08:35.534 --> 08:38.500
Because you have to ascend.

08:40.033 --> 08:44.033
Because in the evolutionary process you have to ascend.

08:44.200 --> 08:47.167
And you can never be satisfied with yourself

08:47.267 --> 08:49.300
unless and until you have achieved it.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.234
Especially the seekers.

08:51.434 --> 08:54.634
That’s why I say they are the special category.

08:55.167 --> 08:58.100
Because, in this special category,

08:58.267 --> 09:02.167
"men of God will have to become prophets,

09:02.300 --> 09:05.367
and they will have powers to make others prophets,”

09:05.534 --> 09:11.601
said by William Blake. In your great country William Blake has said this.

09:12.434 --> 09:17.400
When is that going to happen? It has to happen today, tonight.

09:20.400 --> 09:26.334
But there are barriers within us, built in.

09:27.500 --> 09:35.400
Not because of anything else but only because we have been seekers.

09:38.400 --> 09:45.167
We have been going to various roads of seeking,

09:45.300 --> 09:48.133
whatever suited us.

09:48.267 --> 09:55.300
Wherever we went to, we have tried to find something.

09:56.033 --> 10:02.267
And we have ensured ourselves within ourselves sometimes.

10:02.734 --> 10:06.234
We have built up certain barriers.

10:08.434 --> 10:12.667
Now when you become the prophet

10:14.200 --> 10:19.033
you actually become your own master.

10:19.300 --> 10:21.267
You become a free person.

10:22.167 --> 10:27.534
You have to be a free person. So far you are not.

10:28.500 --> 10:36.334
You cannot overcome your own weaknesses, your own temptations,

10:37.634 --> 10:46.400
infatuations, emotional problems, mental worries. Why?

10:47.267 --> 10:53.033
Because you are still standing in the waves of this turmoil,

10:53.267 --> 11:05.400
this troubled area where you just see the waves all the time

11:05.601 --> 11:08.601
and you are frightened of getting drowned.

11:08.767 --> 11:11.367
But if you somehow or other get out of it

11:11.667 --> 11:16.267
and get into the boat of your own being,

11:16.534 --> 11:21.234
then you enjoy, you become the witness, the sakshi.

11:21.534 --> 11:26.534
Even to understand the scriptures you have to be a free person,

11:26.734 --> 11:28.667
which you are not.

11:29.467 --> 11:31.734
You have to be your own master.

11:32.267 --> 11:34.567
For that you cannot pay.

11:34.801 --> 11:39.400
I am too free that I cannot accept anything.

11:43.167 --> 11:46.667
To get your freedom of Spirit you can’t pay

11:46.734 --> 11:49.300
because money is binding.

11:50.267 --> 11:53.734
Money has no value in the Divine field!

11:54.434 --> 12:00.300
Nothing can bring forth this but your own ascent.

12:00.701 --> 12:05.767
And how do we ascend? Is there anything built within us?

12:06.400 --> 12:15.067
So whatever I am telling you today is the knowledge of the roots.

12:15.634 --> 12:21.467
What we see is the knowledge of the tree.

12:22.167 --> 12:23.734
We see it from outside.

12:24.167 --> 12:26.167
We see a leaf from outside.

12:26.234 --> 12:32.234
If you have to treat the leaf we have to go to the roots.

12:33.234 --> 12:36.267
But from outside, when we see the tree

12:36.267 --> 12:38.634
we are still outside the tree.

12:39.300 --> 12:43.434
When you have to treat the leaf, you have to go to the roots.

12:43.601 --> 12:46.400
If you pluck out the leaf, it is dead.

12:46.634 --> 12:48.400
Then [if] you put it under the microscope

12:48.400 --> 12:52.334
you can go on seeing cells after that you can see the nucleus.

12:52.467 --> 12:56.167
You can go on analysing it, and analysing it making it dead,

12:56.601 --> 12:59.467
dead and dead and dead.

13:00.167 --> 13:03.601
But to treat it you have to go to the roots.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.133
And this knowledge of roots we have to know.

13:08.634 --> 13:12.400
There’s nothing wrong in knowing something new.

13:15.067 --> 13:17.200
These are not new ideas.

13:18.033 --> 13:22.100
These are ancient ideas. Very ancient ideas.

13:22.234 --> 13:26.167
In The Bible it is described as The Holy Ghost.

13:26.367 --> 13:29.167
One priest was asked, I saw, on the television.

13:29.267 --> 13:33.267
A very high ranking priest, “What do you know about Holy Ghost?”

13:33.300 --> 13:35.400
He said, “I am agnostic.”

13:36.701 --> 13:39.267
So then they said, “Then what are you doing here?”

13:39.267 --> 13:42.234
He said, “I am doing my job!”

13:44.033 --> 13:49.267
If that is the attitude towards God, towards your inner knowledge,

13:49.467 --> 13:51.234
then you can never reach there,

13:51.234 --> 13:54.701
as you cannot reach the tree through the leaf –

13:55.067 --> 13:57.267
you have to go to the roots.

13:58.300 --> 14:03.300
This has been available only to seers

14:03.601 --> 14:06.267
like, you can say, William Blake.

14:06.601 --> 14:10.601
Like we had many in other countries.

14:10.767 --> 14:14.367
But they did not talk about it because perhaps

14:14.500 --> 14:18.167
that was not the time for people to know.

14:21.033 --> 14:26.167
But in many languages it is described.

14:28.634 --> 14:35.133
Now the roots within us, if you can see this (chakra chart),

14:35.500 --> 14:38.567
are placed in this manner.

14:39.167 --> 14:44.667
When I went to America the Jungian Society invited me

14:44.734 --> 14:48.601
to talk to them about the unconscious.

14:49.033 --> 14:50.300
I had never read Jung,

14:50.367 --> 14:52.267
though I knew he was a realised-soul,

14:52.300 --> 14:55.267
at least he got his realisation at the later time.

14:55.534 --> 14:57.367
So I said, “Alright let me have one book,

14:57.434 --> 15:00.734
let me see what is he saying about it, see.”

15:01.300 --> 15:06.734
And as I opened the book I saw a diagram,

15:07.701 --> 15:10.267
what he had drawn of a human being

15:10.267 --> 15:13.234
and I said, “That’s the mistake.”

15:13.767 --> 15:16.467
Because he saw human beings from outside

15:16.601 --> 15:19.234
and he described them in layers.

15:19.467 --> 15:25.100
Like first he said is the unconscious that cannot be expressed,

15:25.167 --> 15:28.400
manifested, then the unconscious that can be manifested,

15:29.100 --> 15:32.167
then he said above that is the sub-conscious.

15:32.167 --> 15:36.267
And then he said above that is the conscious mind.

15:36.300 --> 15:41.701
Then above that is the ego. Like layers, one after another.

15:43.634 --> 15:49.434
Now when you are sitting here, though you are in layers,

15:50.534 --> 15:55.467
the path is laid down vertically (the path between the chairs in the hall).

15:57.133 --> 16:03.500
In the same way within us, God being the greatest organiser,

16:04.334 --> 16:07.634
He has not made us into layers

16:08.100 --> 16:11.334
but what he has made us [is] in a parallel way,

16:11.367 --> 16:14.167
as you can see there very clearly –

16:15.334 --> 16:18.234
left side and right side.

16:20.300 --> 16:25.701
Left side and right side [and] the central path.

16:26.567 --> 16:34.267
Three paths He has made within us for our evolutionary process.

16:34.367 --> 16:38.167
The central path works out our evolution.

16:38.367 --> 16:42.200
The left side gives us the desire

16:43.167 --> 16:47.234
and the right side gives us the power of action.

16:48.701 --> 16:51.167
These are just the principles I am telling you.

16:51.167 --> 16:57.434
But you can understand, slowly, when you grow, all the details about it.

16:57.734 --> 17:02.534
The central path of evolution has brought you, today,

17:03.133 --> 17:07.167
to this level of human awareness.

17:08.367 --> 17:17.567
Now beyond that is a very short ascent, which you have to achieve,

17:18.067 --> 17:21.167
by which you become the Spirit.

17:22.033 --> 17:27.267
But there has to be some living process for this to happen.

17:28.133 --> 17:31.601
And what is that living process built within us?

17:32.167 --> 17:37.300
Is the reflection of the Holy Ghost within us in the triangular bone,

17:37.367 --> 17:41.400
which is called as ‘Kundalini’ in Sanskrit language.

17:44.801 --> 17:51.100
This exists within us. And you can see with your naked eyes,

17:51.167 --> 17:54.167
sometimes, in some people, where there is an obstruction

17:54.234 --> 17:58.400
in the higher centres, it starts pulsating.

17:59.500 --> 18:05.234
And when it ascends you can also see it clearly

18:05.267 --> 18:08.601
in some people when it is obstructed.

18:09.100 --> 18:15.167
Or through your stethoscope you can feel the percussion –

18:15.234 --> 18:20.000
which we call as anahatha – up to the top of the head here,

18:20.267 --> 18:25.734
where it pulsates and then it breaks.

18:26.400 --> 18:30.334
When this breaks the pulsation stops

18:30.500 --> 18:34.167
and you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

18:34.234 --> 18:38.167
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.601
This is the happening and not the Truth.

18:43.534 --> 18:46.767
In the sense that the happening takes place

18:47.200 --> 18:50.500
so that you get connected with the Truth.

18:51.167 --> 18:55.400
So the connection takes place and you start feeling

18:57.167 --> 19:01.100
on your fingertips the cool breeze of The Holy Ghost

19:01.167 --> 19:02.567
which surrounds you.

19:03.434 --> 19:05.701
Actually, you start feeling it.

19:06.367 --> 19:10.234
But then as the rational mind it says, “So what?”

19:10.634 --> 19:13.367
“Now we are feeling the cool breeze – so what?”

19:13.667 --> 19:19.334
Then one should know that when we have eyes we start seeing,

19:19.667 --> 19:22.300
when we have ears we start hearing,

19:22.567 --> 19:27.734
so now we have got new awareness, what is this awareness?

19:28.200 --> 19:32.434
This is the awareness of collective consciousness, that you become.

19:33.167 --> 19:36.367
Again I say, “You become!” You are not just certified

19:36.367 --> 19:38.534
but you become. It’s a question of becoming,

19:38.667 --> 19:42.167
that you become collectively conscious,

19:42.200 --> 19:47.801
that on your central nervous system you can feel another person,

19:48.436 --> 19:53.610
you can feel your Self, you can feel your centres which are shown here,

19:53.897 --> 19:57.378
you can feel the centres of others on your fingertips.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.300
And the best on this, is Mohammed Sahib, I would say,

20:00.367 --> 20:02.167
because he has written clearly,

20:02.234 --> 20:06.367
“At the time of resurrection your hands will speak.”

20:08.921 --> 20:11.167
But who talks about the resurrection?

20:11.234 --> 20:13.400
In nowhere people talk about it.

20:13.718 --> 20:15.300
They talk about the doomsday.

20:15.300 --> 20:18.167
Because they can frighten people of the doomsday first,

20:18.267 --> 20:21.434
and take advantage of it and make money out of it.

20:23.167 --> 20:28.224
God who has created this Universe, He feels love,

20:28.438 --> 20:32.234
do you think he will destroy this great creation of His

20:32.267 --> 20:34.367
without giving us the fruit,

20:35.269 --> 20:41.133
without letting us know the fruit of his creation?

20:43.167 --> 20:52.133
He is the wisest of wise, the Greatest Compassionate source of love,

20:53.159 --> 20:59.371
how could he allow this Universe to be destroyed?

20:59.490 --> 21:07.458
Especially this Earth, which is a special present from Him.

21:08.200 --> 21:12.167
So don’t believe in all these stupid ideas of destruction

21:12.167 --> 21:20.400
and the Last Complete Devastation.

21:22.133 --> 21:23.984
Still lot of time.

21:24.396 --> 21:28.234
Let’s first enjoy the blessings of the Divine

21:28.267 --> 21:30.234
for which He has created you.

21:31.300 --> 21:34.267
So the experience of Truth has to be felt

21:34.267 --> 21:37.234
on the central nervous system.

21:38.781 --> 21:45.984
The problem is not that you will not feel – you will feel it –

21:48.167 --> 21:53.967
but, as you know, the experience is very slow in the Western countries.

21:54.444 --> 21:58.267
I am sorry [to say that]. Not that you are in any way less seekers.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.200
You are very great seekers. I would say you are greater seekers

22:01.234 --> 22:03.267
than the Indians are, much greater seekers.

22:03.706 --> 22:09.167
Indians have still to cross lot of steps to come up to your level,

22:09.167 --> 22:12.234
no doubt. But while coming up to this level,

22:12.234 --> 22:15.167
you have gathered [a] lot of problems around you,

22:15.569 --> 22:27.188
and that’s why the seeking sometimes takes time to express itself

22:27.564 --> 22:31.397
as a fruitful gain of Self-realisation.

22:31.667 --> 22:34.445
So you will get your realisation, no doubt,

22:34.643 --> 22:37.133
but again the Kundalini goes down.

22:37.234 --> 22:41.334
I must tell you very frankly, because I cannot be dishonest with you.

22:42.167 --> 22:48.355
But it can be brought up by you, by understanding how to work it out.

22:48.625 --> 22:52.267
By co-operating with yourself,

22:53.133 --> 22:56.886
by understanding yourself that you are the temple of God

22:57.259 --> 23:02.367
and that you have to work it out with respect to yourself.

23:03.701 --> 23:06.568
And you have to give some time.

23:07.465 --> 23:10.900
I mean, in Caxton Hall, you must have seen,

23:11.628 --> 23:13.921
I had thousands of people coming to me.

23:14.100 --> 23:20.133
I have been working in this England for twelve years now, twelve years.

23:20.295 --> 23:22.367
It’s the last year now.

23:23.449 --> 23:25.590
There’s a special reason for that.

23:25.963 --> 23:30.751
But what I find [is that] people get their realisation and then get lost.

23:31.100 --> 23:33.167
Then when they have some disease or something,

23:33.167 --> 23:36.367
they’ll telephone to me, “Mother, now I am in the lunatic asylum!”

23:36.400 --> 23:38.798
or, “I am suffering from cancer.”

23:38.965 --> 23:42.406
“Now that’s happening to me. Can you help me?”

23:42.938 --> 23:45.644
It’s too far gone a case [to help].

23:45.930 --> 23:51.300
But if you know how to handle your roots, how to nourish it,

23:51.334 --> 24:01.682
how to look after it, then you flower out, you bear fruits,

24:02.023 --> 24:05.267
and by your fruits people know what you are.

24:06.505 --> 24:10.801
Then you become trees, giant trees, like Boddhi trees,

24:11.234 --> 24:15.300
and many who come under such trees, get realisation.

24:17.843 --> 24:21.015
English are a great people no doubt.

24:21.420 --> 24:25.547
They are placed in a country which is the Heart of the Universe.

24:25.928 --> 24:27.523
You are very important.

24:28.062 --> 24:31.167
I have given the maximum time to England,

24:31.884 --> 24:34.751
you’ll be amazed. Maximum time.

24:36.100 --> 24:42.300
But the Sahaja Yogis who are not in England

24:43.425 --> 24:47.013
have grown much faster than in England.

24:47.528 --> 24:54.267
The reason is, it’s like the foundation that always gets damp here.

24:57.300 --> 25:02.426
You have to again puncture something inside the foundation,

25:02.664 --> 25:06.403
remove the dampness. Again it gets damp.

25:06.678 --> 25:12.512
Rather difficult! But once they are settled

25:14.939 --> 25:22.200
you will be circulating the Divine interpretation,

25:22.225 --> 25:25.764
the Divine experience of Truth, all over the world.

25:25.819 --> 25:30.234
You are at the heart point and this is what you have to do.

25:32.267 --> 25:38.334
We cannot be mediocres in Sahaja Yoga.

25:39.756 --> 25:42.656
There is no compromise with your Self.

25:42.787 --> 25:46.660
You become so powerful that you don’t compromise also.

25:46.740 --> 25:50.327
You can just get out of everything in no time.

25:50.565 --> 25:54.605
But you must accept yourself first of all, have faith in yourself.

25:54.851 --> 25:58.095
Once upon a time the English had too much faith in themselves,

25:58.190 --> 26:01.835
I mean extraordinarily ‘powerful’ people.

26:02.357 --> 26:04.882
Now they are the other way around – they have no faith.

26:05.100 --> 26:06.267
You see now the sap has come up,

26:06.267 --> 26:10.234
as if the dampness has come, “Oh, we are good for nothing!”

26:10.663 --> 26:14.367
This is the second phase that I find in this country –

26:14.400 --> 26:18.300
it’s complete lethargy. “Oh what can happen?

26:18.334 --> 26:22.267
Let us be destroyed Mother! Now that’s the best for us!”

26:23.267 --> 26:26.267
Completely reconciled to our doom.

26:27.815 --> 26:34.679
And I look at them with great hope. They have to circulate.

26:35.584 --> 26:40.551
They are the cells, who are lying in the heart,

26:41.083 --> 26:46.300
who have to pump the heart. Now what am I to do?

26:47.267 --> 26:50.133
So I have to make a humble request with you:

26:50.663 --> 26:54.425
that I know the experience of Sahaja Yoga is slow

26:54.536 --> 27:01.300
but very steady and I am sure that today

27:01.300 --> 27:05.451
I have got people who are of [a] rare quality of courage.

27:05.808 --> 27:11.267
An assiduity, which was the English character, once upon a time.

27:12.167 --> 27:15.350
And that they will take it up seriously:

27:15.533 --> 27:18.445
their ascent and the ascent of the whole world.

27:19.279 --> 27:22.246
We’ll be having about three more lectures

27:22.398 --> 27:25.342
and there I will be telling you more elaborately

27:25.628 --> 27:30.580
about Kundalini and the chakras and about all this knowledge.

27:30.929 --> 27:34.881
All this knowledge is available to you now,

27:35.167 --> 27:39.794
because it’s time was for you to know all the secrets.

27:42.601 --> 27:44.481
Some newspaper people asked me,

27:44.514 --> 27:48.167
“Mother have you got your disciples all very great scholars?”

27:48.167 --> 27:50.434
I said, “No, they are all very ordinary people.

27:50.768 --> 27:54.400
Some may be – who are more difficult –

27:56.133 --> 28:01.670
but mostly they are very normal, ordinary people.

28:02.716 --> 28:07.367
Simple people. But what makes you think that way?”

28:07.400 --> 28:10.255
They said, “They are so scholarly they know so much!”

28:10.486 --> 28:13.367
Because you become The Knowledge.

28:14.869 --> 28:17.200
So Truth is the knowledge.

28:17.267 --> 28:22.250
The rest of it is all mythical, is mythical.

28:22.615 --> 28:26.781
What do we know about things is all mythical,

28:27.027 --> 28:31.741
because whatever we see from outside, is outside.

28:32.133 --> 28:37.664
Like, I would say, we appreciate Mona Lisa,

28:38.981 --> 28:43.680
we appreciate the miracles as we say,

28:43.926 --> 28:48.727
the great miracles that human beings have created. Why?

28:49.437 --> 28:51.504
Why do we call them miracles?

28:52.533 --> 28:56.267
Sometimes we think that, maybe because it’s a very miraculous task,

28:56.267 --> 29:01.100
they have done – mentally we think – but actually it is not so.

29:03.167 --> 29:08.234
Because they have vibrations, they have Divine vibrations,

29:08.267 --> 29:12.100
they emit vibrations and they appeal to you

29:12.167 --> 29:16.848
because in your heart lies that Spirit which is the Universal Being

29:17.100 --> 29:22.234
and which gives that feeling of bewilderment

29:23.663 --> 29:30.663
when you see these great miracles that human beings have created.

29:31.552 --> 29:33.585
At least I have seen six of them,

29:33.830 --> 29:36.767
and all of them have tremendous vibrations.

29:36.901 --> 29:41.877
But unless and until you become a realised-soul, how will you know?

29:46.401 --> 29:48.567
Now this is the only gap.

29:48.821 --> 29:53.297
And to become the realised-soul you have to have

29:53.631 --> 29:59.481
the ascent of the Kundalini and the proper state

29:59.806 --> 30:02.639
of that Kundalini to remain there.

30:02.981 --> 30:08.947
And that’s the point where I found we lack in efforts,

30:13.457 --> 30:16.524
lack in courage, in patience.

30:17.100 --> 30:23.400
So again and again I request you that – don’t be superficial.

30:24.159 --> 30:27.434
Let Americans be superficial. You’d better not be.

30:28.820 --> 30:34.409
You be solid people, serious. Take it up seriously!

30:34.528 --> 30:39.167
Because you are going to lead the Europeans, the Americans,

30:39.931 --> 30:42.898
even the Greeks, even the Italians.

30:43.167 --> 30:46.900
The problem is the horse is behind the cart!

30:48.167 --> 30:52.944
Sitting lethargically. Now what am I to do to the horse?

30:53.100 --> 30:57.167
That, “You get up now! Because of you the cart is not moving.”

30:57.786 --> 31:01.857
That’s why I make a very, very special request to you all,

31:02.267 --> 31:06.300
that you must decide that – if we get our Realisation,

31:06.334 --> 31:09.167
we’ll establish ourselves into Sahaja Yoga.

31:09.267 --> 31:12.267
For which you don’t have to pay, there’s no membership,

31:12.300 --> 31:15.200
there’s no organisation. Nothing.

31:20.977 --> 31:28.859
I have nothing to take from you. You can’t give me anything.

31:33.441 --> 31:38.267
So I hope today, many who are new will get their Realisation

31:38.354 --> 31:42.259
and establish themselves and will not forget it.

31:42.536 --> 31:45.267
Because in the beginning the experience is very great,

31:45.300 --> 31:48.267
you feel as if you are coming out of a pub!

31:50.267 --> 31:54.400
I don’t know what that experience is! Must be terrific! (laughter)

31:56.173 --> 31:59.267
Because I see so many people coming and falling down

31:59.267 --> 32:03.314
and again so many going in. So I used to wonder, “How is it?”

32:04.132 --> 32:08.513
Must be some memory of something great, must be there!

32:12.377 --> 32:19.344
So by God’s grace you should all get your Realisation

32:20.167 --> 32:23.167
and I would like to have some questions,

32:23.350 --> 32:27.676
but in that I would like to say that there are people I know,

32:27.962 --> 32:31.267
we've had before also, belonged to some gurus or something,

32:31.300 --> 32:33.315
paid by some gurus have come.

32:33.482 --> 32:38.498
Because the gurus are feeling that I am, in a way, attacking them.

32:38.665 --> 32:42.768
In a way, they feel that way because I say you cannot pay –

32:43.093 --> 32:46.167
so all their profession is finished! (laughter)

32:47.593 --> 32:49.593
So they get angry with me for that.

32:49.730 --> 32:52.904
So they might  be saying, “Ah, you go and attack Her.”

32:52.929 --> 32:55.135
And all sorts of things.

32:55.506 --> 33:00.373
And there could be some people who are aggressive because of

33:01.530 --> 33:04.464
other problems of ego or something.

33:04.879 --> 33:06.300
So you need not be aggressive.

33:06.300 --> 33:09.450
I have come here to give you what you have.

33:10.046 --> 33:15.267
And you need not be also docile about it or slavish.

33:16.100 --> 33:23.167
I have come here to give you or tell you, what is freedom.

33:23.916 --> 33:28.916
Now you may also say, which is a very common question arising in your mind –

33:29.167 --> 33:31.876
and justifiable – that why should I do it.

33:32.200 --> 33:36.200
Now that’s the miserable part of it, that I have to do it.

33:36.755 --> 33:41.169
I wish you could do it – but you can’t – that’s the trouble.

33:42.034 --> 33:45.811
And if I have to do it, I don’t hurt your ego.

33:46.338 --> 33:49.338
No, I don’t want to hurt you.

33:50.234 --> 33:54.409
You see this is something people don’t understand

33:54.631 --> 33:57.200
that why should I do it?

33:58.100 --> 34:04.292
You can do it also but first I’ll have to take you a little bit ahead,

34:04.641 --> 34:07.609
your awareness has to grow a little more.

34:07.784 --> 34:09.791
And then you can do it on your own.

34:10.234 --> 34:14.275
But first definitely, I have to do that.

34:14.474 --> 34:16.133
Which is a headache [for me]. I tell you,

34:16.133 --> 34:18.167
it makes me also a miserable person

34:18.200 --> 34:21.577
because, you know, this is something a thankless job of a Mother.

34:22.385 --> 34:24.285
But I have to do it.

34:24.552 --> 34:28.400
Maybe I am paid for it somehow! I don’t know.

34:28.500 --> 34:34.667
Whichever way it is. But you shouldn’t feel hurt about it!

34:36.622 --> 34:41.456
It’s a crucifixion, I tell you. It’s not easy.

34:41.638 --> 34:45.133
It’s a very difficult task. It’s like [lifting] mountains sometimes.

34:45.167 --> 34:49.914
The Kundalini is just embedded, poor thing, sometimes so hurt,

34:50.167 --> 34:54.167
so wounded that to raise that wounded Kundalini, itself,

34:54.200 --> 34:57.930
takes such a lot of effort.

35:00.248 --> 35:05.065
But one has to do it and I knew I have to do it.

35:07.330 --> 35:12.695
When you will know what it is you will not be angry with me,

35:13.498 --> 35:17.536
but you will understand the task ahead of us, all of us.

35:17.819 --> 35:19.852
All of us have to do it.

35:23.300 --> 35:25.267
May God bless you all.

35:28.334 --> 35:34.524
Now, as this is the first programme, I would like to have questions.

35:34.762 --> 35:39.906
But sensible questions which will help everyone to ascend.

35:40.367 --> 35:42.500
It should not be ‘dog in the manger’ policy –

35:43.133 --> 35:45.601
that you don’t want to ascend? Alright, goodbye!

35:45.601 --> 35:49.234
We cannot force. Actually we cannot force you.

35:50.367 --> 35:54.100
It has to be asked for otherwise I cannot do it.

35:54.601 --> 35:59.234
You have to knock at the door otherwise [the] door cannot be opened.

35:59.400 --> 36:03.601
So those who do not want it should not bother to ask me questions.

36:03.634 --> 36:05.534
I have seen mostly the people who ask me the questions

36:05.570 --> 36:07.367
are the first to go away.

36:08.846 --> 36:11.077
So, this is not meant for such people.

36:11.546 --> 36:17.704
I mean, for that you can join, say miner’s strike or something like that.

36:17.950 --> 36:20.214
(Laughter) (There was a big coal miner’s strike in UK in 1984).

36:20.334 --> 36:24.200
But this is not the place for such people who want to fight it out.

36:24.434 --> 36:27.500
It is something that’s so beautiful,

36:27.667 --> 36:31.200
that is your own, which has to be opened out.

36:33.267 --> 36:36.367
So you can ask me questions will be a good idea.

36:38.267 --> 36:40.133
Thank you very much.

36:40.601 --> 36:45.267
(nobody asks any questions)

36:53.367 --> 36:57.434
That doesn’t mean you should not ask me questions (laughter).

36:57.434 --> 37:01.300
You shouldn’t be frightened. You should ask, you must.

37:12.601 --> 37:18.367
No questions at all ? Now, I’ll ask one question.

37:18.434 --> 37:22.300
How many are new people to Sahaja Yoga? Absolutely new.

37:22.529 --> 37:24.595
Please raise your hands, please.

37:25.839 --> 37:30.806
Can I request you to come in the front two rows, all of you, please.

37:31.234 --> 37:33.710
If you don’t mind. [It] will be a better idea.

37:33.805 --> 37:36.813
Because I want to look after you. Please.

37:42.500 --> 37:47.100
Front two rows you can occupy. Front rows you can occupy.

38:01.234 --> 38:02.400
Please.

38:27.167 --> 38:33.889
Now it is a very collective working, extremely collective.

38:35.100 --> 38:39.322
See, like this finger has some pain so the other hand comes round

38:39.465 --> 38:42.200
and presses it and puts it right. Alright ?

38:42.200 --> 38:46.100
So we are all part and parcel of One Being.

38:46.367 --> 38:57.567
As you call them, the microcosm and the macrocosm.

38:59.234 --> 39:02.567
And only thing [is] the ones which are awakened

39:02.773 --> 39:05.133
will help to awaken the rest of it.

39:05.267 --> 39:08.979
That doesn’t mean anybody is superior or higher or lower.

39:09.200 --> 39:10.500
There is no obligation.

39:10.500 --> 39:14.133
Like my own finger paining if I try to rub it,

39:14.234 --> 39:22.267
am I obliging that finger? No, I am not. Because I can’t live without that.

39:22.612 --> 39:27.351
I can’t bear the pain. And this is me, and this is me too.

39:27.589 --> 39:29.351
In the same way it works out.

39:29.501 --> 39:34.267
So we’ll try to work it out and, when it works out,

39:34.367 --> 39:39.575
some of the Sahaja Yogis will come and see what the situation is,

39:39.694 --> 39:44.334
what are the centres in trouble. Nobody should feel bad about it.

39:45.400 --> 39:48.621
With all respect to you it will be done.

39:48.812 --> 39:53.367
So one should not feel bad or sad about it [or] in anyway hurt.

39:53.467 --> 40:02.367
Why I am saying so [is] because, you see sometimes people feel

40:02.426 --> 40:08.159
that they are challenged. They feel that way. You should not.

40:08.400 --> 40:11.053
It’s for your good, for your health.

40:11.267 --> 40:14.434
So, I am just trying to tell you as a mother would say that,

40:14.567 --> 40:19.634
“It’s alright, you see, and there’s nothing wrong with you.”

40:19.634 --> 40:21.424
So, don’t be frightened of anyone.

40:21.567 --> 40:23.200
Don’t be angry with anyone.

40:23.241 --> 40:26.676
Specially with yourself don’t be angry and it will all work out.

40:26.922 --> 40:29.601
Now, another thing I have to request is to take out your shoes

40:29.601 --> 40:33.234
for one reason that this Mother Earth helps us a lot

40:33.334 --> 40:35.534
and if you take out your shoes the Mother Earth,

40:35.601 --> 40:40.634
you see, for earthing’s sake, it is better to take out.

40:43.276 --> 40:47.926
Everything is so much artificial that it’s impossible

40:48.025 --> 40:50.758
to reach the Mother Earth somehow.

40:51.100 --> 40:53.846
Alright. Put both the feet straight like this.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.267
It helps that’s why. Just to help.

40:56.434 --> 41:00.467
And sit in such a way that your back is straight.

41:01.300 --> 41:05.601
Not too much of like this, forward, or bent.

41:05.634 --> 41:08.400
But in a straight way, in a simple manner.

41:08.516 --> 41:12.833
‘Sahaj’ also means ‘a simple way, spontaneous.’

41:13.055 --> 41:16.055
As you sit, spontaneously.
