00:00:00,246 --> 00:00:06,016
Puja Talk, India Tour. Ganapatipule (India), 6 January 1988.

2
00:01:18,149 --> 00:01:28,255
It is said that God is Satchitanand.

3
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:35,440
He is truth, He is attention and He is joy.

4
00:01:41,044 --> 00:01:52,120
In Sahaja Yoga, first you have discovered the truth.

5
00:01:54,902 --> 00:01:59,869
You discovered the truth on your fingertips.

6
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,972
The truth that you can discover

7
00:02:03,172 --> 00:02:07,865
on your central nervous system is the truth.

8
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:13,143
First you discover the truth and you can tell about it,

9
00:02:13,343 --> 00:02:17,949
talk about, explain about it

10
00:02:18,149 --> 00:02:21,283
but you cannot give it to others

11
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:26,658
unless and until the other person gets Realization.

12
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:32,372
So the truth has to be tested.

13
00:02:34,681 --> 00:02:43,657
One has to test on the fingertips the existence of truth.

14
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:55,700
Otherwise all kinds of descriptions are of no avail.

15
00:02:56,906 --> 00:03:00,574
No one can understand what you are talking about

16
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:04,725
when you tell them that you can feel the all pervading power

17
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:08,821
of Gods' love around you.

18
00:03:12,796 --> 00:03:23,481
And then you start experiencing your attention.

19
00:03:29,246 --> 00:03:39,061
You start feeling that

20
00:03:39,261 --> 00:03:45,021
there is somebody, some force, some power,

21
00:03:45,221 --> 00:03:49,940
some organization is looking after you.

22
00:03:54,417 --> 00:04:02,414
Gradually you find your own attention becomes active.

23
00:04:05,708 --> 00:04:08,547
Today I am happy to say that

24
00:04:08,747 --> 00:04:13,101
I can tell you all these things openly, so clearly.

25
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:20,178
But can you believe that 20 years back even in India

26
00:04:20,378 --> 00:04:25,836
nobody could talk about it

27
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:29,585
because something Agamya, not to be known,

28
00:04:29,785 --> 00:04:32,537
not to be understood.

29
00:04:32,737 --> 00:04:37,761
Because your attention has become enlightened,

30
00:04:38,475 --> 00:04:43,134
with your enlightened attention you are listening to Me

31
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:48,174
that's why you are understand what I am saying.

32
00:04:48,374 --> 00:04:53,124
You attention itself has become active now.

33
00:04:55,093 --> 00:04:58,093
And it baffles you sometimes when you see

34
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,380
how many powers you have got.

35
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:06,459
So through your Kundalini awakening

36
00:05:06,659 --> 00:05:16,346
your attention has got a subtler dimension

37
00:05:16,546 --> 00:05:21,331
which gives you an active attention.

38
00:05:22,966 --> 00:05:29,450
Before this you use to play into the hands of your attention.

39
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:34,490
Anything happen you would turn your head to that,

40
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:40,609
anything that would be called as some sort of an event

41
00:05:40,809 --> 00:05:44,305
or something attractive you

42
00:05:44,505 --> 00:05:48,487
you would be putting your attention to that.

43
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:56,541
Your attention would go to things which were controlling you as if,

44
00:05:56,741 --> 00:06:00,311
as if they were in charge of you.

45
00:06:00,511 --> 00:06:04,212
But after getting Realization

46
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:10,285
your attention itself is under your own power and it
 acts.

47
00:06:13,155 --> 00:06:19,400
First in India we had a foreign rule

48
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,981
so we had to act according to

49
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:26,009
the wish of the foreign rulers.

50
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,423
So we thought it is better to have independence,

51
00:06:31,623 --> 00:06:36,768
to have our own rulers.

52
00:06:38,363 --> 00:06:42,893
So we achieved the freedom politically

53
00:06:43,093 --> 00:06:48,338
we have our own rulers who will rule us

54
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:51,417
according to our own wish

55
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:57,064
and we won't be enslaved by others' wishes.

56
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:02,984
But this is not freedom at all

57
00:07:03,184 --> 00:07:07,856
because your attention is still in bondage.

58
00:07:09,213 --> 00:07:13,132
It has got the shackles

59
00:07:13,332 --> 00:07:17,780
of all kinds of nonsensical things upon it.

60
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,337
It shifts all the time to wrong things.

61
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:34,139
But after Realization attention becomes Nirmal, free,

62
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:38,953
Samarthiya, powerful

63
00:07:39,153 --> 00:07:44,477
it acts because it is completely free now.

64
00:07:44,678 --> 00:07:47,354
Unless and until you are completely free

65
00:07:47,555 --> 00:07:51,995
you cannot act.

66
00:07:52,196 --> 00:07:55,625
This is the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga

67
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:59,943
that your attention has become so free.

68
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:08,633
It acts the way you wanted to act and it communicates.

69
00:08:11,045 --> 00:08:14,768
It communicates to you.

70
00:08:15,656 --> 00:08:21,242
The real communication starts. One
day a gentleman who are given,

71
00:08:21,442 --> 00:08:24,196
whom I have given Realization for the first time,

72
00:08:24,396 --> 00:08:28,266
he got Realization, he was the first one to get it.

73
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:32,155
And he went into his congregation

74
00:08:32,355 --> 00:08:35,917
where he felt that there is somebody else who is a Realized soul.

75
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:39,778
So he looked around and he saw a lady sitting there

76
00:08:39,978 --> 00:08:44,248
who had Realization. He came and asked Me, Mother

77
00:08:44,464 --> 00:08:49,205
did you give Realization to such and such lady. I said I did.

78
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:55,711
So this communication between the reality and yourself

79
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,410
is established through attention

80
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:04,292
because in the attention now there is freedom to know.

81
00:09:05,207 --> 00:09:07,261
But in the attention now

82
00:09:07,461 --> 00:09:11,094
we have to see that there are so many other things

83
00:09:11,294 --> 00:09:19,045
which have clouded the awareness of the attention.

84
00:09:20,085 --> 00:09:27,877
This cloudedness comes with our conditioning and our ego.

85
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:32,510
And this conditioning can be very, very strong.

86
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:36,598
I would say in India, we are over conditioned people

87
00:09:36,798 --> 00:09:39,766
because we are traditionally made.

88
00:09:39,967 --> 00:09:42,725
And we do not see what is good in tradition

89
00:09:42,925 --> 00:09:46,254
and what is bad in tradition. Whatever good we have to keep

90
00:09:46,454 --> 00:09:48,468
and whatever bad we have to throw away.

91
00:09:48,668 --> 00:09:57,823
Whatever is the tradition is the
best is absolutely a wrong idea.

92
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:04,087
So such an attention which is so much bogged

93
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:09,366
or you can say completely covered with conditioning

94
00:10:09,566 --> 00:10:14,360
can not communicate with reality.

95
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:26,030
Though reality is anxious to communicate and to say

96
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:34,520
or to inform whatever is desires of the Divine

97
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:40,778
but, as we are so much loaded with our conditioning

98
00:10:40,978 --> 00:10:45,375
that it can not communicate.

99
00:10:45,994 --> 00:10:48,114
You are frightened of the society,

100
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,399
you are frightened of the surroundings,

101
00:10:50,599 --> 00:10:53,028
frightened of our relations, who are no more our relations

102
00:10:53,228 --> 00:10:55,326
at all, nothing to do with because they have

103
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:58,611
no communication with the reality.

104
00:10:58,811 --> 00:11:02,065
We are the ones who have got now

105
00:11:02,266 --> 00:11:06,356
communication with reality.

106
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:09,311
When the ego part, our futuristic ideas w

107
00:11:09,512 --> 00:11:11,894
e want to develop this, we want to do that

108
00:11:11,894 --> 00:11:15,636
we want to achieve this.

109
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:22,665
That also dulls our attention

110
00:11:22,865 --> 00:11:29,764
and puts it into the shackles of ego
which are even worse I would say.

111
00:11:29,964 --> 00:11:33,456
At least the first one...

112
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:40,527
Some children have beautiful attention and some don't have.

113
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:43,575
I would not always blame the parents but of course partly

114
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,775
they are responsible.

115
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:47,976
At this stage if their attention is not good,

116
00:11:48,177 --> 00:11:51,320
at what age they are going to improve? Parents pamper them,

117
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:56,163
spoil them then the children cant' have good attention.

118
00:11:59,034 --> 00:12:03,103
Those who are half hearted Sahaja Yogis

119
00:12:03,303 --> 00:12:08,630
are still sitting on the edges.

120
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:15,789
And can be anytime brought into the sea of illusion.

121
00:12:16,956 --> 00:12:21,338
You have to be perfect Sahaja Yogis.

122
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:26,638
Some people find it easy, escape it by saying that

123
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:30,527
such and such person is much better than me.

124
00:12:30,728 --> 00:12:33,822
And then too sat back and saying that "oh, I am not good".

125
00:12:34,022 --> 00:12:37,609
So you better get out.

126
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:48,159
Here the Divine needs the people who will do the job of the Divine.

127
00:12:50,523 --> 00:12:52,729
But even if you ask them to get out

128
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:56,801
they'll stick on and stick on and stick on.

129
00:12:57,002 --> 00:13:00,865
It's not going to help them because they think it is blissful,

130
00:13:01,065 --> 00:13:05,955
may be some of them think that they
can have some material advantage.

131
00:13:06,155 --> 00:13:11,107
Some of them think they can get some presents in Ganapatipulle.

132
00:13:11,877 --> 00:13:16,999
Very low grade understanding.

133
00:13:19,547 --> 00:13:25,802
So such people are bothering us and are good for nothing.

134
00:13:26,002 --> 00:13:31,582
The first and foremost thing is to clear your heart.

135
00:13:32,621 --> 00:13:37,202
I have seen that the relationships

136
00:13:37,402 --> 00:13:43,291
is the greatest curse on Indians.

137
00:13:44,248 --> 00:13:51,446
And the second is the caste system.

138
00:13:52,788 --> 00:13:59,927
I know of a lady who is absolutely no good for Sahaja Yog

139
00:14:00,127 --> 00:14:04,010
but her sisters are supporting her.

140
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:06,599
I know all that and as a result

141
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,183
they are losing themselves in Sahaja Yoga

142
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:13,694
and the brother in law has become suddenly hot tempered.

143
00:14:13,895 --> 00:14:16,108
But if I tell them they won't listen

144
00:14:16,308 --> 00:14:18,681
till they are completely finished, all of them

145
00:14:18,681 --> 00:14:22,467
this lady will stick on.

146
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,640
Unless and until this lady clears her heart

147
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:33,590
she should not come to Sahaja Yoga and oblige all the relations.

148
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:38,398
This kind of low graded understanding of Sahaja Yoga

149
00:14:38,598 --> 00:14:46,542
will lead you no where and how many of
you are going to drop out I don't know.

150
00:14:51,376 --> 00:14:53,505
You wouldn't even know when you are catching

151
00:14:53,705 --> 00:14:58,578
and what's happening if you keep to these relationships.

152
00:14:59,753 --> 00:15:03,517
Another, is another myth of a caste system in this country,

153
00:15:03,717 --> 00:15:06,533
which is the greatest cancer, you could think of,

154
00:15:06,733 --> 00:15:10,852
for such a Divine country like this.

155
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:16,605
It's the greatest curse

156
00:15:16,805 --> 00:15:20,153
but in the West we have another curses

157
00:15:20,353 --> 00:15:24,202
though you have got rid of all these past thing

158
00:15:24,402 --> 00:15:27,805
you have modern curses.

159
00:15:28,005 --> 00:15:31,337
And the modern curses are even worse in a way

160
00:15:31,537 --> 00:15:34,315
because they are not troublesome at all.

161
00:15:34,515 --> 00:15:39,162
On the contrary they show as if

162
00:15:39,362 --> 00:15:44,621
you are on top of the world that you are very successful.

163
00:15:48,304 --> 00:15:54,856
In the modern curses the thing is the attitude "what's wrong?".

164
00:15:57,912 --> 00:16:04,650
They linger on this idea to great extent,

165
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:07,753
"what's wrong?".

166
00:16:07,953 --> 00:16:11,962
You have to be selfish about it.

167
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:16,248
You have to think about yourself

168
00:16:16,448 --> 00:16:20,399
and not about others and about your society,

169
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:29,968
about your development, you're so-called industrial revolution.

170
00:16:30,627 --> 00:16:32,608
It has already cursed you.

171
00:16:32,808 --> 00:16:34,895
Industrial revolution has already cursed you.

172
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:38,464
You are eating the food from tins.

173
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:43,220
You are having hybrid animals to give you milk,

174
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,769
tomorrow you will have mothers who are hybrid.

175
00:16:50,777 --> 00:16:54,678
You are having divorces, you are having drugs,

176
00:16:54,878 --> 00:16:58,607
all kinds of things that are curse on human beings

177
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:03,910
are worked out through this modern conditioning in you.

178
00:17:07,498 --> 00:17:10,242
To make this attention clean

179
00:17:10,442 --> 00:17:15,160
should be the only effort of a Sahaja Yogi.

180
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:17,413
Sahaja Yogi is not a pass time,

181
00:17:17,614 --> 00:17:19,778
for many it's is just a pass time.

182
00:17:19,979 --> 00:17:22,494
Their jobs, their businesses is most important.

183
00:17:22,694 --> 00:17:25,827
Sahaja Yoga is just a pass time.

184
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:29,865
They are all right for a time being. How long will they go on?

185
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:32,770
I can't say.

186
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:38,710
So clear your attention first then everything is going to work out.

187
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:41,901
But see that in your attention you pay importance to things,

188
00:17:42,101 --> 00:17:45,953
which are no important at all.

189
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:53,481
In this respect I would say you have to be individual,

190
00:17:53,683 --> 00:17:56,209
to know that your attention has to be clean.

191
00:17:56,409 --> 00:18:00,341
Where is my attention going?

192
00:18:01,865 --> 00:18:08,286
Clubbing is the worst curse that
we have in Western Countries.

193
00:18:08,486 --> 00:18:11,407
They will club under any name. Supposing

194
00:18:11,407 --> 00:18:16,486
there is a red hair people, they will form a red hair league.

195
00:18:22,723 --> 00:18:25,604
In that way I would say

196
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:28,631
people are least individualistic.

197
00:18:28,832 --> 00:18:31,209
Whatever they may say that they are democratic

198
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:34,368
I would say they are least individualistic.

199
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:40,618
If a lady starts a kind of a hairstyle

200
00:18:40,818 --> 00:18:45,849
all the ladies do the same, just like donkeys.

201
00:18:46,490 --> 00:18:49,315
If the men do not put oil in their hair

202
00:18:49,516 --> 00:18:52,370
all the men will not put oil in theirs'.

203
00:18:52,570 --> 00:18:55,054
I don't know what looks nice without the... dishevelled hair

204
00:18:55,261 --> 00:18:57,894
I just don't understand. That's the fashion now,

205
00:18:58,094 --> 00:19:01,881
nobody will put any oil in their hair.

206
00:19:02,082 --> 00:19:06,157
Even if you can wash it off they will not put it.

207
00:19:07,713 --> 00:19:13,619
This is such a simple thing

208
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:18,517
that you need oil for your hair.

209
00:19:20,597 --> 00:19:28,332
But all these modern ideas are anti life.

210
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:40,193
They are teaching you something which will make you bald.

211
00:19:40,393 --> 00:19:45,292
Sometimes you lose your ears or nose or whatever it is.

212
00:19:46,292 --> 00:19:48,949
To put that in the ears all the time and

213
00:19:49,149 --> 00:19:52,804
listen to that music all the time and going on the streets,

214
00:19:53,004 --> 00:19:58,923
on those wheels, I mean it's really madness I think,

215
00:19:59,123 --> 00:20:02,695
stupidity, absolutely.

216
00:20:02,895 --> 00:20:07,181
But regarded as something very modern.

217
00:20:07,808 --> 00:20:11,180
It's all anti life activities going on.

218
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:18,076
Putting color on the hair, red, yellow, green,

219
00:20:18,457 --> 00:20:21,741
wearing no clothes when it's so very cold,

220
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:28,097
sitting in the sun burning your skin,

221
00:20:30,152 --> 00:20:37,160
to behave indecently, decorously, that is to be modern.

222
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,390
"What's wrong?"

223
00:20:40,590 --> 00:20:46,688
Nothing is wrong, just to go to hell, that's all.

224
00:20:46,888 --> 00:20:52,354
If that means nothing, take two running jumps and go there

225
00:20:52,554 --> 00:20:56,856
but leave Sahaja Yoga.

226
00:20:59,276 --> 00:21:02,788
Now the attention has to be cleared in a way that we meditate

227
00:21:02,788 --> 00:21:05,790
within ourselves and just go within yourself,

228
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:09,403
but see yourself what you are,

229
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:15,603
how beautiful you are, how glorious you are, how subtle you are.

230
00:21:18,658 --> 00:21:21,964
But in stupid things they are individualistic,

231
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:26,162
like "this is my carpet and this is my house,

232
00:21:26,362 --> 00:21:30,179
this is my furniture."

233
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,400
And they control others with that "this is my furniture,

234
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:39,735
don't sit on that chair. Don't spoil my carpet".

235
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:47,098
When you will die you won't be
buried with the carpet even.

236
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:56,113
Like in Egypt Pharaohs were buried with all their things you see.

237
00:21:56,313 --> 00:21:59,256
It is not possible these days because you don't have so much place

238
00:21:59,256 --> 00:22:02,988
to bury.

239
00:22:03,884 --> 00:22:05,930
So sticking on to nonsensical things

240
00:22:06,130 --> 00:22:11,176
and the important things not paying attention

241
00:22:11,376 --> 00:22:14,636
 is an absolutely abuse of your attention

242
00:22:14,836 --> 00:22:17,493
and this has been achieved

243
00:22:17,693 --> 00:22:23,411
through your so called modern idea of individualism.

244
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:32,609
There is no integration of understanding

245
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:40,682
and the whole thing is breaking into pieces.

246
00:22:43,152 --> 00:22:49,761
Between these two horrible extremes

247
00:22:49,961 --> 00:22:56,118
I have dared to start Sahaja Yoga,

248
00:22:56,318 --> 00:23:00,699
to collect you all there in the center.

249
00:23:02,421 --> 00:23:05,421
How?

250
00:23:06,478 --> 00:23:10,756
With very intense love.

251
00:23:13,518 --> 00:23:18,936
With very intense effort

252
00:23:19,136 --> 00:23:25,541
and a complete commitment that I am going to save this world.

253
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:37,360
It has worked so well now,

254
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:46,639
I can see you all get into the third stage of joy.

255
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:54,408
And the joy is what I want you to have

256
00:23:54,608 --> 00:24:01,334
and not self-destruction or stupid conditioning pressures.

257
00:24:01,534 --> 00:24:04,270
Joy

258
00:24:04,470 --> 00:24:10,726
and joy has no double meaning it's absolute.

259
00:24:12,949 --> 00:24:16,256
You reach to that subtlety that you start enjoying

260
00:24:16,456 --> 00:24:22,248
the tasting of joy, not vibration but joy,

261
00:24:24,478 --> 00:24:27,675
beyond your central nervous system

262
00:24:27,875 --> 00:24:32,360
where it can not be expressed in words.

263
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:38,817
It expresses in your eyes, in your faces, in the atmosphere,

264
00:24:39,017 --> 00:24:42,794
in the nature, everywhere

265
00:24:42,994 --> 00:24:47,708
to see the whole thing is blossoming around.

266
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,725
This is what you all have to achieve

267
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:57,923
and for that we have to know

268
00:24:58,123 --> 00:25:03,937
that we are not going to bow down to anything

269
00:25:04,137 --> 00:25:09,153
that puts our attention into shackles.

270
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:15,027
"Mother has freed us, let us spread our wings."

271
00:25:15,227 --> 00:25:18,534
"We are not little, small little birdies

272
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:21,900
but now we have become birds

273
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:31,229
and let us spread our wings and fly in the sky of joy".

274
00:25:36,888 --> 00:25:41,085
There is no need for birds to fly.

275
00:25:41,759 --> 00:25:44,464
They can sit at a place,

276
00:25:44,664 --> 00:25:48,377
of course, they cannot hire a bus,

277
00:25:48,577 --> 00:25:52,347
but they need not.

278
00:25:55,800 --> 00:26:02,060
They spread their wings and fly because they enjoy it,

279
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:09,998
like swimming in the sky of joy.

280
00:26:12,545 --> 00:26:18,933
So use the beauty of this joyous happening

281
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:21,386
to nourish yourself,

282
00:26:21,586 --> 00:26:24,092
be happy,

283
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:31,293
make everyone happy and emancipate this world from ignorance.

284
00:26:31,494 --> 00:26:34,833
May God bless you all.
