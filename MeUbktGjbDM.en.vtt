00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:07.280
This day for us to remember that Christ was born on this earth.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.520
As a human being, He came on this earth.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.240
And the task that was before Him

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.240
was to enlighten human awareness

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.240
with the sense of understanding,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.400
but we can say it is actualization,

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.840
within the awareness of human beings,

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.800
that they are not this body but they are the spirit.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:58.080
The message of Christ is His resurrection.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:04.320
That is you are your spirit and not your body.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.120
And He showed by His resurrection,

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.200
how He ascended into the realm of spirit – which He was,

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.280
because He was Pranava, He was Brahma, He was Mahavishnu –

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.840
as I have told you about His birth.

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:44.920
And when He came on this earth, in a body, like a human being,

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.160
He wanted to show another thing

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.960
that spirit has nothing to do with money,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.160
has nothing to do with power.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:13.280
It is all powerful, all pervading, but He’s born in a stable,

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:28.240
not in a palace or to a king

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.120
but He was born to a very ordinary person, a carpenter.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:51.080
Because if you are the king, as we say in Hindi language, Badshah

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.840
then nothing is greater than you, isn’t it? It means simply that.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.880
Nothing is higher than you, neither anything can decorate you,

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.080
because whatever you are, you are at the highest.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.200
All the worldly things so called, are just like dry grass, Trinavat.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.160
So He was kept in the dried grass.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.800
To many it makes very unhappy and they feel very sorry,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.440
that Christ, the one who came to save us,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.360
was kept under such conditions and why not God provided Him with

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.160
something better? But to such people it does not matter:

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:50.680
whether you are lying in the dried grass or in the stable

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.800
or in the palaces, everything is just the same

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.720
for it does not touch them, they are so detached

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.440
and they are completely in joy. They are the masters of themselves –

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.640
nothing can master them.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.520
No matter can master them, no comfort can master them.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.960
They are masters of complete comforts within themselves,

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.600
they have achieved all the comforts within themselves,

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.480
they are satisfied people.

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.240
That’s why they are kings, they are called as kings,

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:33.360
not those kings who run after things,

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.600
or those kings who seek comforts in life.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.840
I mean if you have comforts well and good.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:45.720
If you don’t have well and good, makes no difference.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.960
So many people, specially in Latin America when I went there,

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.120
they said, “but we can’t understand why

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.520
Christ was born as a poor man.”

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.560
This is again the human concept about God is,

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:06.240
you see he wants to command God, be born in a King’s palace.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:13.240
You cannot order Him about. We have our own concepts about God that,

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:16.840
“why should He be a poor man; why should He be helpless?”

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:19.440
He never showed His helplessness.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:23.120
He was much more dynamic than all your kings and all your

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.320
politicians put together. He was not afraid of anyone.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:30.680
Whatever He had to say He said it.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:37.160
He was not afraid of crucifixion or any such “punishment” so called.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.240
It’s only the human beings. you see,

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.480
who have these false ideas about life

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.720
and that’s why they want to put these ideas onto God also

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.720
and try to make Him follow their own concepts.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:59.880
God is not your concept. He’s not a concept at all.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:05.920
To also say that “Concept is after all is a concept”

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:10.120
is also a concept – this I found out very recently.

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.440
This is another myth people carry.

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:17.920
Those who say, that “Oh, concept is a concept! All right?

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:20.560
Mataji says, all right.” So what?

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:28.800
But even this is a concept, because concept is thought.

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.760
You have to rise beyond thought at a higher level

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.400
into thoughtless awareness where you are not in thought but you are

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:42.160
in the center of the thought.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.400
In the sense that one thought rises and falls

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.560
and there is a place in between, another thought rises and fall.

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:54.520
You are in the center of these thoughts. The Vilamba as we call it.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:07:02.640
The time where you pause. Then you will understand Christ.

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:10.560
He was here, partly of course to save us,

00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:13.360
because He had many aspects I should say,

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.560
not only to save human beings He came on this earth.

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.880
There were many more aspects,

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.760
this is also human beings have a demand, you see

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:31.640
that that they must be saved, why?

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.560
One shouldn’t. I Mean from God’s angle if you see,

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:38.800
why should they be saved all of them?

00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.120
What have they done for God?

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:48.040
How can you demand God that “You must save us?”

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:55.680
Can you? You cannot ask for that.

00:07:57.880 --> 00:08:08.120
So He did come to create the passage between as you see here,

00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:15.120
the Vishudhi and the Sahastrara, this Agnya.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:21.280
In the primordial being the Virat – He was born there,

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.720
to open that door.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:32.160
In evolution, every incarnation has come on this earth

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:38.880
to open a particular door within us and to create

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.080
that opening or that enlightenment in our awareness.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:52.280
So Christ came precisely for opening this small little door,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:58.320
which is constricted by our ego and superego.

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:06.400
Ego and superego are the two byproducts of our thought process.

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:11.320
One the thoughts, that are of the past and the other,

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.600
thoughts of the future.

00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:21.640
He came to make that gap, to cross that gap,

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:34.960
and that’s how He has sacrificed Himself, His body.

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:49.680
For you it is a very big thing of remorse and repentance,

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:56.600
but for such people it is not, it’s a play.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.960
They have to play a certain role.

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.960
That’s why I do not understand why do you show Him to be

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:06.080
such a lanky, panky, miserable creature.

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:10.680
He was never miserable.

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.280
Such people can never be miserable as you are.

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:17.480
This is another concept of man, that He should be lanky, panky,

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:25.640
tally, skinny, starved, bones coming out, count them one by one.

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.840
Horrible! I tell you.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.600
From His childhood to His death He was jolly person,

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:44.640
He was happiness, He was joy. To make you all happy,

00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.800
to give you the

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:53.200
light of happiness by enlightening your source of joy,

00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.840
that is your spirit in your heart.

00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.240
That He came on this earth – not only to save you –

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:05.920
first to give you happiness, to give you joy.

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:11.520
Because human beings in their ignorance and in this tomfoolery,

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.280
are unnecessarily beating themselves and destroying themselves.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.680
When nobody asked you to go to pubs to get into trouble;

00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:27.400
nobody has asked you to go to races and become bankrupts;

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:33.280
nobody has asked you to go to horrible gurus and get into troubles.

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.800
But you seek your destruction morning till evening.

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:44.880
Then He comes there, like a morning flower, to make you happy.

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:52.000
First to make you happy, to give you joy. You see any child.

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.160
You see any child at least I know Myself,

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.920
I don’t know about the funny people here I mean,

00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.320
for them flowers also look like thorns,

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:02.080
I mean I don’t know how they manage that stuff.

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.280
But you see a child anywhere, any child,

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.000
such a joy giving thing it is.

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:12.200
And this is the child of the divine –

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:16.560
that comes on this earth as a child –

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:20.560
is the most joy giving thing.

00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.600
And that’s why Christmas for all of us, for the whole Universe

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:32.000
should be a festival of great joy.

00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:39.200
For He brought light for us by which you could see

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.280
that there is someone called as “God.”

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.440
There is someone, who is going to remove this ignorance.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:52.640
This was the first beginning.

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:04.960
So, for us, it is necessary to be first joyous and be happy

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:12.680
and relaxed, and not to take anything that seriously as we take.

00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.560
Because divine life doesn’t make you serious.

00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:24.560
Because it’s all a play, it’s a maya.

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:32.920
I have seen in all the rituals that people follow,

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:35.280
in all the so called religious people,

00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:38.840
they are too serious to be religious.

00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.320
And religious person is bubbling with laughter.

00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:45.320
He doesn’t know how to hide his joy.

00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:50.560
And he doesn’t know how to control his laughter when he sees people

00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.760
who are unnecessarily serious.

00:13:52.960 --> 00:13:55.880
I mean nobody’s dead. The way they people say it,

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:58.720
it’s sometimes, you just don’t know what to do with yourself.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.400
You just can’t control.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.480
So there’s nothing in this world for a person like Christ

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:07.360
to feel sad about.

00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:09.360
And if you really believe in Him,

00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:13.560
then please first of all give up your, this silly sadness

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:20.040
and sulking and sitting down and becoming morose,

00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:25.720
not talking to anyone, silent bores allover.

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.520
That is not the way to look at Christ.

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:31.400
See how He went and talked to multitudes,

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:39.640
how He opened His hands to all the people around

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.600
and how He tried to give them happiness.

00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:51.040
He has said that you are to be born again.

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.240
That means, He had to do this work

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.000
and that you have to get it

00:14:57.200 --> 00:15:02.280
sometime He had promised that you are to be born again.

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.680
Christ is to be born within us.

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.880
I don’t know what Christians understand out of this.

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.640
How do you become born again?

00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.720
Not by going through a ritual of christening,

00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.400
somebody coming from a theological college

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.280
cannot make you a Christian.

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:25.560
Like in our India we have some paid Brahmins,

00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:28.840
as you have here paid people you see,

00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.560
the whole day they will eat, drink, be merry and evening time

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:36.760
they’ll come and pray and preach, that sort of people.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:44.840
You have to be a person who is authorized by God.

00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.400
Unless and until you are authorized by God, you cannot give joy.

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.320
And that’s why I’ve seen all these people the so called…

00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.960
big pundits and the big… priests

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:05.760
and all of them are so serious because they are not authorized by God.

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.520
Even on a Christmas day, I mean anybody who comes from a village

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.720
may think there’s a funeral going on.

00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:23.000
And after the funeral they go home. How do you celebrate?

00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:27.680
With a champagne! And after the funeral also real funeral

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:29.600
also they’ll celebrate the… I don’t know why,

00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.800
but they take champagne.

00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:42.360
How can you celebrate Christ by insulting Him.

00:16:42.600 --> 00:16:45.160
He came to enlighten

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.480
your awareness because He respected your awareness,

00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:54.680
the point at which it had reached, but you are trying to put it down.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.880
Is this the way to understand Him?

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:05.720
And He has promised that you are to be baptized,

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.560
you are to be born again. And now, in Sahaj Yoga,

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:13.680
this promise is being fulfilled. So be joyous,

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:18.360
that here at the Agnya chakra, again Christ is born within you

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:24.800
and He’s there and you know how you can ask for his help, always.

00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:31.080
But the main thing that one has to understand,

00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:38.480
that the time has come for you to get all that is promised

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.360
in the scriptures. Not only in the Bible, but all the scriptures

00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:47.360
of the world the time has come today.

00:17:47.560 --> 00:17:56.280
That you have to become a Christian, a Brahmin, a Peer,

00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:00.200
through your Kundalini awakening only.

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:08.440
There is no other way out. And that your last judgment is also now.

00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:16.760
Only through your Kundalini awakening, God is going to judge you.

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:20.840
How is He going to judge you otherwise, you think of somebody now.

00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.200
A person comes in, now here is somebody sitting to judge you.

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.400
How? By how many hair dressers you have been to?

00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:31.760
Or how many suits you have stitched for the Christmas?

00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:35.920
Or what presents you have bought and how many cards you have sent?

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:40.840
And to how many people you have

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:45.600
sent some other things which may not be very palatable.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.840
That’s not the way.

00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:54.480
Or is it, that at what price you bought all the things?

00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:01.840
The way we are particular? Which way are we going to be judged

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.880
by God?

00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:13.840
Not superficially people say, so what depth have we got, let’s see?

00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.080
How far can we go in our depth?

00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:24.400
At the most we reach a point where we are nothing but a concept again.

00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.960
So whatever depth we know goes up to only rationality

00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.960
up to the concept point beyond that we can not reach.

00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.160
So how can we be judged?

00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:41.680
How do people are judged if you go to a doctor?

00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.920
He has his instruments, an’ he works it out, puts the light in,

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:51.120
sees for himself and says this is the position.

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:58.280
And how your spirituality is going to be judged?

00:19:58.640 --> 00:20:04.520
How a seed is judged? By sprouting it!

00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:10.800
When you sprout the seed and when you see its germinating power

00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.240
you know it’s a good seed or a bad seed.

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:18.840
In the same way, you will be judged by the way you are germinated,

00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:22.640
the way you receive your realization, the way you retain it,

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.280
the way you respect it.

00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.680
That is how you are going to be judged and not by the kind of dresses

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:29.840
you are wearing.

00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:34.800
By the type of matching you do and the hair dressing you go to.

00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.360
Not by the big positions you occupy and the big politicians

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.680
and big bureaucrats you become.

00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:48.520
Not by what kind of houses you have built and what kind of so called

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.760
Noble [sic] prizes you have won.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:55.600
You are not also going to be judged by your philanthropic work

00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.160
by that you think that you have given so much money so much so,

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:01.200
because you, if you have given so much money

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.280
there will be big ego somewhere hanging and it will bring you down

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.880
your scale.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:12.800
This is a judgment in which

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:18.840
the little feather is going to weigh more, much more than a ship.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:26.760
It’s a different type of a judgment, of a personality.

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:32.640
You can see how Christ was judged by human beings

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:37.960
and how He was judged by God.

00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:49.440
He came and lived in the dried straw like a feather.

00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:55.200
His mother never felt His discomfort.

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:10.840
In the same way those who have not by there being,

00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:20.160
oppressed others or taken oppression, are going to be judged

00:22:20.600 --> 00:22:24.600
as first class.

00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:29.800
In the Kundalini awakening itself there are inherent defects.

00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.880
Inherently the Kundalini has some defects,

00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:38.080
because of your previous karmas.

00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:42.960
Because what you have been doing in this lifetime.

00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:49.400
Because, the things that you have accepted as

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.920
reality, which is just a concept.

00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:57.680
Because, when you have not known the absolute,

00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:59.560
whatever you will be doing,

00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:03.760
there will be a little of ignorance with it.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.160
Whatever you have done in darkness

00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:10.360
will have a particle of darkness in it.

00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:14.720
So without knowing realization if you have propagated,

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:20.000
“Oh, we are great saints, this that,” you’ll have no chance.

00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:23.520
If you think you are a very divine personality,

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:28.920
and you are already a realized soul, no chances!

00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:32.240
All the priests of all the religions,

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:37.400
will be the last to get realization.

00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:43.960
Valmiki in his Ramayana, has very clearly said,

00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.760
a very interesting story is there, that, a dog was asked

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.640
what do you want to be in your next life?

00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:56.400
So he told “make me anything but don’t make me a Mathadhish.”

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:00.640
A person. Mathadhish is a person like a “priesthood.”

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:06.920
So make me everything but not a priest anywhere.

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:12.400
Just imagine a dog having that wisdom.

00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:18.880
But I do not say that all of them are like that.

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.400
There may be some who are really genuine,

00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:25.920
some may be really realized people, may be authorized by God.

00:24:26.120 --> 00:24:29.040
But I am sure they are not accepted, by the multitude,

00:24:29.240 --> 00:24:33.360
I am sure of that. Because I have seen your history and all that,

00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:39.200
I’ve seen all such people have been discarded and have been tortured.

00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:49.680
But now the time has come… to judge the right and the wrong.

00:24:50.880 --> 00:24:56.280
You cannot crucify anymore. you cannot.

00:24:56.640 --> 00:25:02.120
Everyone is going to be judged through Kundalini awakening.

00:25:02.360 --> 00:25:10.000
Now, we should know there are three categories of human beings.

00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:13.880
I don’t know which way to start, not to shock you,

00:25:14.080 --> 00:25:21.280
one is human beings as we are, normal. They are called as Narayoni.

00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:24.200
The second categories are Devayoni.

00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:27.280
Those who are born seekers or realized souls,

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:30.560
mostly realized souls are Devayoni.

00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:35.520
And the third ones are called as Rakshas. These are called as Ganas.

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.680
Actually these are called as Ganas.

00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:43.400
But is the We can say the species among human beings are Rakshasas.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.520
Means the people who are evil.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:52.640
So we have evil people, excellent people,

00:25:52.840 --> 00:26:00.520
and we have in-between people. Excellent people are very few.

00:26:00.720 --> 00:26:05.600
They are born realized. I don’t have their problem much.

00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:10.840
But one has to deal with the people who are in the center.

00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:19.760
They are looking towards good but have something hanging on to them,

00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.280
which is not so good.

00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.760
So for these people, there are inherently some defects

00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.280
in the Kundalini, which we must understand.

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:36.520
The first of them is bad health,

00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.280
physical bad health, actual physical bad health.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.720
In this country specially people suffer from too much of cold

00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:56.320
and other troubles due to over calcium in the water,

00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.440
in the same way according to the countries,

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.960
stanavishesh as they call it, you have your problems.

00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.880
Like in our country we have some problems;

00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.040
like in your country you have certain problems.

00:27:09.240 --> 00:27:13.480
So, the physical problems are according to the country

00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:14.920
where you have taken your birth.

00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:21.320
Most of you have decided to take birth in particular countries.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:27.640
That’s why you are identified also to such an extent sometimes

00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:31.720
that you think there is no defect.

00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:37.560
Every country has a variety by which you suffer a certain

00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:41.400
amount of setback in your health.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.200
So for a Sahaj Yogi

00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:48.600
one should know that health is a very important thing.

00:27:48.800 --> 00:27:51.560
Because this body is the temple of God,

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.360
and one has to look after your health.

00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:57.520
And you know also when the Kundalini rises the first thing that

00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.200
happens that your health improves.

00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.240
Because of the parasympathetic fulfillment.

00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:09.800
Because parasympathetic gives you enlightenment

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:15.960
which flows into sympathetic and your health improves.

00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:21.600
I will not tell about it very elaborately today because time is short.

00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:27.080
But, if you read My..I would say I haven’t yet written much,

00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.720
but if you listen to My lectures,

00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.520
and some of them which are written down,

00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:39.400
you will know how Kundalini helps to cure most of the diseases,

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:47.080
except for which are being tampered by human elements,

00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:51.120
like a kidney trouble now has been cured by Sahaj Yoga.

00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:54.440
No doubt, we can cure kidney trouble.

00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:58.040
But a person who has been on the machine, we’ve tried,

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.920
cannot be cured.

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.120
We can give him longevity, but he cannot be cured.

00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:08.560
But to cure people is not your job at all by any chance,

00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.800
you must remember this.

00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.040
No Sahaj Yogi should take to curing people.

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:15.760
They can use my photograph.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.280
But not to take to curing, because it means you are a big

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:22.800
philanthropic personality.

00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:26.120
I have seen people who have been curing,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.680
get into such a mania of curing,

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:32.920
that they forget that they are also catching something and

00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:35.760
they are also getting some troubles and they never cure them self,

00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:41.240
ultimately I find they get out of Sahaj Yoga.

00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:45.560
But with the Photograph you can cure people.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:51.120
Do not think that it is your duty that you are a great sort-of-a…

00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:58.200
what you call a… benefactor, physical benefactor, no, you are not.

00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:02.520
You are a spiritual benefactor but as a byproduct,

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:09.160
the body of the person improves because if

00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:12.760
Christ has to be awakened,

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:20.800
if God has to come in this body, then this body is to be cleansed.

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:25.440
It is done by Kundalini.

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:33.160
But it does not have a separate work like hospitals.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.800
I have known people who went so mad with their power of curing that

00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:42.000
they started visiting regularly the hospitals,

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:45.760
and they ended up in the hospital only.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.600
They would not even come to programs;

00:30:48.800 --> 00:30:51.240
they would not even come and see Me.

00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:54.080
So this is one of the greatest hurdles you have got

00:30:54.280 --> 00:31:01.680
is the Vyadhi, is the bodily elements.

00:31:03.520 --> 00:31:09.400
And the bodily element also should not take you down too much.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:12.560
If we have some problem, forget it.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.200
Gradually it will improve, with some people it takes time

00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:17.160
to get all right.

00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.120
But the main thing is, to get to your spirit.

00:31:22.320 --> 00:31:27.800
So do not always say “Mother, cure me, cure me, cure me.”

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.280
But just say “Mother give me the spiritual life,”

00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.040
and you will be cured automatically.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:39.280
It may take time in some people, doesn’t matter.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:42.120
You have been sick all your life, doesn’t matter.

00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.000
Little more time.

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.520
And also follow the methods which [I HAVE …del] we have told,

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:55.400
about different diseases, specially liver in this country, colds,

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:59.600
and what you call this gout and all these troubles.

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:04.840
We have remedies for all this. Diabetes, we have,

00:32:05.160 --> 00:32:15.000
but work it out as a duty towards your body, towards the temple.

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:19.920
But that should not be the end of your life,

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.480
that’s a very little part.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:26.440
I mean it would be something like cleaning the whole place…

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:29.160
and then you get out of it. They say “Why did you clean?”

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:32.680
Like I have seen here people, you see, even we were in Oxstead

00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.160
I was surprised, you see everybody used to polish everything you know,

00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.800
and everything was, sort of, lawn was done very well

00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:44.160
and everything cleaned very well, and not even a rat would enter

00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:45.400
their houses even.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:49.000
For months together I never saw any person getting in,

00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.680
only getting out, and they were so particular.

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:56.880
Husband wife, so particular about cleanliness, neatness, everything…

00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.720
and the both of them would never even talk to each other,

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:04.040
I have seen that. There were seven houses, except for our house,

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:06.680
and [SHE WAS …del] they were all surprised at how many people are

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.080
coming to our house, they said “Are you a open house?

00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:10.880
I said “Yes, it is a open house.”

00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:15.080
They couldn’t understand what was wrong with us.

00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:17.960
Nobody would see that polished thing or anything,

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.160
so, that’s how it should be that we should not go to that extent.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.800
That it becomes a sort of real “Sahaj Yoga and the rest”

00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.440
which is the most important is forgotten.

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:33.840
Health will improve gradually as I have told you.

00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:38.720
But attention should be on your spirit.

00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:44.000
Attention should be on your spirit, because it is the attention,

00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:48.240
which goes into these various directions and gets stuck.

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:52.080
You just allow it to work out and it will work out.

00:33:52.360 --> 00:34:01.840
The second hurdle which I feel, is called as akarmanyeta.

00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:10.560
Osnath, they call it. Means a person… does not want to work it out.

00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.920
Of course those people who are useless,

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:16.160
who do not want to have realization, forget about them.

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:20.280
But even after getting realization, it’s an innate problem

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:25.760
with people that they do not want to work it out.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.440
They are lazy; in simple words, they are lazy.

00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:34.080
That is very much in this country, surprisingly.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:38.120
I mean the other day I saw a picture, where how, even from your

00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:44.440
country people went to Germany and blasted a complete machinery

00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:47.600
and a complete factory of that machinery which was sending

00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:50.600
pilot-less bombs.

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.960
And they have overdone everything so then our children are having a

00:34:54.160 --> 00:35:03.680
nice time, perhaps. But, in Sahaj Yoga, you have to be alert .

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.280
This what exactly happens in Sahaj Yoga when people come here:

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:12.280
they get their realization, they feel the cool breeze,

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:17.360
and is lost again. The reason is, they do not want to work it out.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.880
This is another danger, akarmanyeta.

00:35:21.080 --> 00:35:25.360
Then, when it is lost, after one year they’ll come back “Mother?

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:29.160
We don’t believe in it, but I have got some pain in the stomach,

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.760
will You cure me?”

00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:37.600
Instead of… you becoming so equipped with all the powers that you

00:35:37.800 --> 00:35:41.000
have, you become another useless person coming here,

00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:47.440
just to take My time. These powers are all within you.

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:51.960
This is your property. This is the property of your spirit

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:57.080
which is there inside, which is about to manifest but,

00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:03.520
because of certain hurdles that you accept, that it does not.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:08.320
This is akarmanyta, we can say.

00:36:08.640 --> 00:36:11.960
Which is, not working it out, not knowing about it,

00:36:12.160 --> 00:36:14.960
not understanding it, what is Sahaj Yoga is,

00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:18.320
how to manipulate this, what are these vibrations are,

00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:25.440
how it works out? People just say, “Oh! It’s too much.”

00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:29.000
Because they don’t want to face the reality.

00:36:29.240 --> 00:36:31.640
Because as soon as your Kundalini comes up,

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.440
as soon as the light comes in before, the eyes are closed,

00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:39.040
you see suddenly the light comes in, you don’t want to open your eyes.

00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:42.360
Because too much we have been sleeping.

00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:44.800
Even if you open your eyes a little bit, “Oh God!”

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.840
You don’t want to face the light.

00:36:47.040 --> 00:36:49.880
Because you are identified with that state,

00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.080
you do not want to open your eyes.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:59.400
Kundalini opens your eyes, no doubt, but again you close it down.

00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:05.520
So it is in your freedom, to give up that akarmanyeta.

00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:11.280
Now this is also, can be very collective, I can tell you this much.

00:37:11.480 --> 00:37:14.560
It’s a very big disease, which spreads.

00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:19.160
Like, say a husband wife is there, the wife is one like that.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:23.680
Instead of the husband raising the wife, he will succumb to wife,

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:27.360
specially in the west. Just the opposite in India,

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.080
because [THE del] there the husband is more dominating,

00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:35.520
the women will succumb to a husband.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:40.800
So what happens is, that out of the two those who have got it also

00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:42.720
are just wasted.

00:37:42.920 --> 00:37:46.280
Instead of that, both of them could be very well realized,

00:37:46.480 --> 00:37:50.120
and could be there if the one who is realized,

00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.760
puts down his will, that “No, I’ll keep my eyes open to see.

00:37:54.960 --> 00:38:01.520
Let me see. I must give a chance to myself.” If they accept it,

00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:07.040
then it works and then they go to the second step.

00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:12.680
Everything cannot be just like a jet liner, sit down here and…

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:19.160
next moment you are on the… moon?

00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.680
Even if you are in the moon,

00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.400
still you may start with the third danger which is there,

00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:33.000
is sanshaya. Is the doubting.

00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:39.440
I don’t know how to describe this madness of doubting.

00:38:39.720 --> 00:38:44.040
For example, out of all of you who have been here,

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:50.400
I would say, at least, I don’t know how much percentage…

00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.720
[Yogi very softly:] Ninety.

00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.120
[Shri Mataji:] [laughs] …have come out with the second day

00:38:55.320 --> 00:39:00.640
a very great statement “Still I am doubting.”

00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:06.880
Is that the sign of wisdom? What are you doubting?

00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:12.520
What have you found out so far?

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:16.320
From where does this come?

00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:22.040
Is Mr. Ego, about which I have given lectures after lectures.

00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:26.160
Is Mr. Ego that is doubting it?

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.720
Because he doesn’t want you to find the absolute.

00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.320
You are identified with your Ego,

00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.080
and you do not want to find it because,

00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.640
this Mr. Ego has been guiding your life throughout,

00:39:38.880 --> 00:39:42.880
and now [YOU DON’T …del] you want to doubt. Doubt what?

00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:50.360
What are you doubting? You felt the cool breeze, all right?

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.800
Sit down then.

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.080
It would be something like somebody entering into a college,

00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:00.080
university, and they are going sitting down firstly there,

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:04.040
teacher says “Now, this is the diagram, I give you.”

00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:09.400
The students get up and say, “Sir we doubt.” Really?

00:40:09.720 --> 00:40:13.720
Then what should the teacher say. But they will not say that,

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:21.160
because they have paid the fees. They have paid it.

00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.960
Even if it is a horrible drama, boring one,

00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.840
still we go through it because we have paid, you see?

00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.400
To go through it “After all, we have paid it,” you see? What to do?

00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:39.240
But for Sahaj Yoga you cannot pay.

00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.680
I have seen all kinds of tomfoolery people accept in so many gurus.

00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:49.640
Like somebody says “I am going to teach you how to fly.”

00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.840
They’re absolutely ready for that.

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:55.920
They’ll pay money, and not doubt, even a bit,

00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:59.040
that the fellow who is propagating is he flying?

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.760
Have you seen him flying anywhere?

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.560
Please at least ask that person to fly.

00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:06.840
They will see the Kundalini rising with their eyes,

00:41:07.040 --> 00:41:09.880
they will see it pulsating, rising, breaking here,

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:12.440
still they’ll sit down and say “I am doubting.”

00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:16.960
Now who are you? How far have you reached?

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:21.240
Why are you doubting? What are you doubting?

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:24.520
What have you known so far about yourself?

00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:30.000
Now, humble down yourself at this point Humble down in your heart.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:36.640
“No I have not known myself. I have to know myself.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:41.000
I have not known myself, I haven’t got the absolute.

00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:43.120
With what instruments I am doubting?”

00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:46.920
This is one of the greatest hurdles of Kundalini awakening

00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.880
and in after awakening, called as Samshaya.

00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.040
[THE SECOND …del] The fourth one we can call it as Pramaada,

00:41:56.240 --> 00:42:02.800
is the one by which we go on faltering all the time…

00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:09.440
foolish questions. I mean there are certain things one has to follow,

00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:11.920
if you are going on the road you see,

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:15.520
you are used to say continental driving,

00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:19.840
so always you turn on the wrong side,

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:23.600
but in London you will be arrested.

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.800
In the same way so far you have been doing continental driving.

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:35.520
Now you are in London, so you better take to the ways of Londoners

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.360
and understand the roads and the maps and the regulations

00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:46.800
that are needed, and try to follow them. But you are doubting it.

00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.360
That’s the main point. Then you don’t want to follow it.

00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:55.120
So the pramad is the mistakes that arise,

00:42:55.320 --> 00:43:03.040
because Kundalini awakening is a free gift to anyone who comes here.

00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:12.200
To anyone who has been to any sort of hell or heaven or has done…

00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:13.840
[Break in original recording, end of tape side 1]

00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:20.840
point about it. And why do you doubt. You are not paying any money.

00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.440
These two things go hand in hand –

00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:27.960
doubting and pramad is the mistakes that we commit throughout.

00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:31.120
Because we are doubting, that’s why we do not take it up seriously,

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:33.400
we do not understand it – the rule of the road –

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:42.000
and we just start driving. And then we have accidents.

00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:47.600
And then when we have accidents we blame Mataji for that.

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:56.240
That is a very-very, common thing that happens,

00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:59.920
that we blame Sahaj Yoga.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:02.960
We blame that spontaneous happening within us;

00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:05.400
we never take the blame upon ourselves,

00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:08.440
that “No, I must have done this mistake.” All right, doesn’t matter,

00:44:08.640 --> 00:44:12.640
if I make mistakes I will rectify, it’s all right.

00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:18.560
Mother is forgiving, no doubt, I forgive,

00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.320
but sometimes my forgiveness is also of no use

00:44:21.520 --> 00:44:24.440
because unless and until you realize that it was a mistake

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.320
you should go this way instead of that you have gone that way,

00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:31.520
so rule of the road is to be understood.

00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:36.800
That is the one comes to us, called as pramad.

00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:43.440
After that, we have another inherent problem is called as

00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:48.120
Bhramadarshan, hallucinations.

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:51.640
We start seeing hallucinations, specially with people who take

00:44:51.840 --> 00:44:53.920
LSD and all [THE …del] such things.

00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:58.120
They don’t see Me sometimes they just see lights.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:04.120
Or any such hallucinations you see of the future or of the past.

00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.160
They may see Me as something else

00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.120
and they may see Me as something else.

00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:10.520
If you see Me in dreams is all right,

00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.880
or see something in dreams is all right.

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:20.080
But you start seeing some things, that’s called as Bhramadarsha.

00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:25.240
Bhrama means illusion. Then you start developing illusions.

00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:30.640
But the worst part of it is that people start telling lies about it.

00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:37.880
I know about everyone. And when this bhramadarshan starts,

00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:42.960
it’s the most dangerous thing about vibrations also.

00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:49.720
Some people are absolutely cocksure about themselves, I see that.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:53.640
And they’ll tell all the world, you see they’ll dominate everybody

00:45:53.840 --> 00:45:55.440
saying that “The vibrations of this is not good,

00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:57.160
the vibrations of that is not good,”

00:45:57.360 --> 00:46:01.200
while they have no mastery over it.

00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.840
Now if I, somehow or the other,

00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:07.240
see I have to be very careful I can’t talk like a teacher,

00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:10.480
so I somehow or other say that “All right, you give yourself a bandhan

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.640
and now you put your hands towards me and you see for yourself,”

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.080
and all that.

00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:21.320
If they by any chance know that I’ve found out, that they are lying,

00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:23.720
then they are finished.

00:46:23.960 --> 00:46:28.600
I must keep up their falsehood everything in me.

00:46:28.880 --> 00:46:32.200
In by chance you see, I am very careful though because I know

00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:34.560
they are always on a slippery ground,

00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:42.520
so even if I mention in a way that is not so blunt or anything,

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:49.720
still it might happen. But one must know that it is for our good,

00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:55.440
that we have to stick on to the truth. And we should not be led away

00:46:55.680 --> 00:47:00.800
by our own ideas about ourselves.

00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:11.920
Then [THE – del] another thing comes is – Vishaychitta.

00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:15.880
In which the attention is attracted by objects

00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.960
of your previous identification.

00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:23.640
Like your attention has been, “You see I’m very found of cricket,”

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:29.480
“all right, you are.” But you should not be a sick person.

00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:35.160
I mean cricket doesn’t mean that you become a cricket bat.

00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:37.520
And you are good for nothing for anything else,

00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:40.520
for all practical purposes you are dead.

00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:47.160
That kind of craziness, for anything whatsoever,

00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:51.200
gets your attention into a very wrong state,

00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:54.200
and is also not good for all the Sahaj Yogis.

00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.240
Today’s lecture is more for the Sahaj Yogi.

00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:03.120
So I am pointing out what are the inherent dangers of

00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:10.680
sustaining our realization. Which is very important to understand.

00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:17.400
Now the two other very big dangers which we suffer from,

00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.120
apart from that the people get possessed

00:48:20.360 --> 00:48:22.840
and get ideas into their heads,

00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:27.440
they start singing songs, this that Sometimes I am so embarrassed,

00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:31.520
I don’t know what to say, I can see a devil speaking through them,

00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:34.520
but I just don’t know how to tell them that “Oh please stop.”

00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:38.120
Even praising Me I know what it is.

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:42.200
But they’ll just come up and say, “Mother, we want to sing a song to

00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:45.440
you.” “All right, finished.” I can not say anything,

00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.520
because they do not know what they are singing.

00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:51.360
They do not know from where did they get this knowledge.

00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:55.560
It’s something else doing this.

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:01.560
Because of all these problems that you get possessed,

00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:04.480
the other day somebody came to me and said,

00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:08.920
that “Mother I’m feeling very overconfident about myself and cocksure.”

00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:12.320
“Really?”“And I feel like doing something very high handed,”

00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:20.120
and he did it. First he saw the possession coming in to him.

00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:25.000
And then he did it, and did it in a very bad way.

00:49:25.200 --> 00:49:30.880
Everybody’s angry with him. I know, but I’m not.

00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:33.720
Because something is done in possession,

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:38.320
you don’t know what madness people can do when they get possessed.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:41.600
I mean they should end up in lunatic asylum, but because of being

00:49:41.800 --> 00:49:45.360
Sahaj Yogis, they do all these things.

00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:50.840
But still they are not stationed where they should be.

00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:57.040
Then there are two more stages in which,

00:49:57.400 --> 00:50:01.680
a Kundalini which rises also falls down.

00:50:01.880 --> 00:50:06.360
This is an inherent danger in a person. Many people have asked Me

00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:10.400
that “Mother, if we get realization does it stay?”

00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:15.880
It does stay, part of it. Sometimes it is very thin part of it,

00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:21.640
sometimes the whole thing is sucked back. It is sucked back.

00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:24.600
Is so, then you will say “Then we start doubting.”

00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:29.560
Where is it written that, “You will be lifted up

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:36.680
and put into something great, whatever may be your problems.”

00:50:36.920 --> 00:50:40.680
Is it possible? Even from here if I have to go to India,

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:44.360
I have to get inoculations and vaccinations,

00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:50.200
and I have to get My passport, go through an interview…

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:54.400
While if you have to enter into the kingdom of God,

00:50:54.600 --> 00:50:59.160
then you are going to be judged, not only judged,

00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:03.280
but even when supposing you give a grace mark and all that

00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.400
and a person is allowed to sort of, get into the plane,

00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:11.040
may be that they may ask you to get down. Is possible.

00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:16.480
And that happens with some people that the Kundalini falls down.

00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:22.520
Is very, very dangerous sign. It comes through many problems

00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:28.360
like gurus and, going to wrong places also going to spirits

00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:36.120
and doing all black magic and, also bowing before people who are not

00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:42.560
incarnations, worshipping wrong type of deities and also doing

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:48.920
mad rituals. Fasting at wrong times and not understanding

00:51:49.120 --> 00:51:53.800
the signs of fasting and of ritualism and chakras and the

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.920
connection a complete synthesis of Sahaj Yoga.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:03.880
And it falls down. In some people you have seen that Kundalini rises

00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:08.040
and immediately falls down is a very, very dangerous thing which

00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:10.800
really is very troublesome also.

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:15.000
But still one can fix it up.

00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:20.480
Last danger that we have which one should know that you start feeling

00:52:20.680 --> 00:52:26.960
that you have become God or some like an incarnation or something.

00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:31.240
This is the biggest danger. And then you start taking law into your

00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:39.400
own hands and start rebuking others or… doing all kind of highhanded

00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:47.160
business. Or getting over self-satisfied with yourself.

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:49.800
This is a very big danger.

00:52:50.080 --> 00:52:57.440
Humility is the only way, to know that there’s an ocean before you.

00:52:57.720 --> 00:53:03.080
You have got into the boat all right, but you have to know a lot,

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:08.520
you have to understand a lot, and you have to still attend to your

00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:13.480
attention, to your chitta, to your awareness.

00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:18.240
And you have to still work it out in such a way

00:53:18.440 --> 00:53:25.600
that you really establish your self, as a full-fledged Sahaj Yogi

00:53:25.800 --> 00:53:29.800
by which collectivity becomes a part and parcel of your being.

00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:33.680
By which you have no doubts left.

00:53:33.880 --> 00:53:38.160
From thoughtless awareness you jump into doubtless awareness.

00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:42.280
Unless and until that happens within you, is not mind,

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.480
but is a state in which only the Kundalini will rise,

00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:48.160
whenever you’ll raise your hands.

00:53:48.360 --> 00:53:51.440
Unless and until you have achieved that state,

00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:58.520
please try to work it out, don’t be lazy.

00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:02.200
You have to see around yourself, meet people, talk to them,

00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:05.720
the more you talk about it the more you do it the more you give it,

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:08.000
the more it will flow.

00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:12.280
The more you sit at home, “Oh, I am doing my puja at home.” Nothing.

00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:16.800
It will stagnate and stagnate. You have to give it to others,

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000
you have to think of others. Thousands of them have to have it.

00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:26.000
And that’s why it is important that don’t get bloated with the idea

00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.640
that you have all the powers of the world, already manifesting.

00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:31.080
Never.

00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:36.080
When these powers really manifest you are really not aware of them.

00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:42.160
Absolutely. I mean imagine the Sun saying “I am The Sun.”

00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:45.360
Will he say so? When he is the Sun, what is there?

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:47.320
If you go and ask the Sun “Are you The Sun?”

00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:51.520
He said “Yes, by the way I am, what can I do about it?”

00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.920
It’s that simple, you know you become a very simple person,

00:54:56.120 --> 00:55:00.320
absolutely simple, because there is no…

00:55:00.520 --> 00:55:05.400
camouflage, there’s no complication. You are that.

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:11.000
So, anybody asks you funny questions you say, “By the way,

00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:13.920
what is there to ask?, It is so. I mean, if I am a realized soul,

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:18.120
I am, what does it matter?”

00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:26.160
With this understanding we have to go to Sahaj Yoga,

00:55:26.360 --> 00:55:32.760
which I must say I am surprised, how it is working, miraculously.

00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:38.160
And it is working out, but it is you who can settle it,

00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:45.720
within yourself. Now, among you some are only on the periphery.

00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:49.720
We keep them on periphery also, that you know very well.

00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:52.800
Some of them come in the center.

00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:58.840
And some are very few, who are in the inner circle.

00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:04.080
All of them are still in a state where they can be thrown out,

00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:06.440
like a tangent go down, you see?

00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:10.000
And then you don’t understand why a Sahaj Yogi behaves like that.

00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.280
If you see some Sahaj Yogi behaving like that, going in a tangent

00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:17.480
know that you might do the same. So be careful.

00:56:18.320 --> 00:56:26.160
So, today, at this juncture, when we are celebrating the great event

00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:30.360
of Christ’ life, let us know that Christ is born within us,

00:56:30.600 --> 00:56:34.600
and the Bethlehem is within us.

00:56:35.800 --> 00:56:39.480
You don’t have to go to Bethlehem it’s within us.

00:56:39.680 --> 00:56:47.600
He is there, and we have to look after it. It’s still a child.

00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:53.520
You have to respect it, and you have to look after it.

00:56:53.840 --> 00:56:57.040
So the light… really glows

00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:02.160
and people know that you are realized souls.

00:57:02.360 --> 00:57:07.800
Nobody will doubt that you are not.

00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:14.600
May God bless you, all.
