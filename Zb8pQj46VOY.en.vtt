00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:47.739
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.742
we have gathered here

00:01:53.943 --> 00:02:01.107
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

00:02:06.711 --> 00:02:10.200
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

00:02:10.401 --> 00:02:15.348
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.621
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

00:02:20.822 --> 00:02:25.337
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

00:02:25.538 --> 00:02:32.166
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:38.234
and that you can do this Puja performed.

00:02:38.862 --> 00:02:41.385
It's your right.

00:02:41.596 --> 00:02:45.401
You are chosen for this.

00:02:45.861 --> 00:02:49.554
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

00:02:49.755 --> 00:02:52.020
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

00:02:52.221 --> 00:02:59.572
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

00:03:02.596 --> 00:03:11.439
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

00:03:21.776 --> 00:03:27.254
These are specially created cells

00:03:27.455 --> 00:03:31.376
through the working of the Swadishthana.

00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:35.774
Passing through all the chakras,

00:03:35.975 --> 00:03:39.071
when they arrive at Sahasrara

00:03:39.272 --> 00:03:47.503
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

00:03:47.704 --> 00:03:56.678
without getting involved into

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:01.419
other elements in the body.

00:04:04.878 --> 00:04:10.849
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:18.068
are not to be involved with the other cells -

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.270
human beings,

00:04:22.471 --> 00:04:26.830
of the body of this universe.

00:04:31.402 --> 00:04:35.734
The first thing that happens

00:04:35.935 --> 00:04:39.940
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

00:04:40.141 --> 00:04:45.008
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.519
So, many things he transcends:

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.493
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:56.936
Time is his slave.

00:04:57.694 --> 00:05:01.050
If you have to go somewhere

00:05:01.251 --> 00:05:07.361
then suddenly you discover

00:05:07.562 --> 00:05:15.179
that everything is working about the same time

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:19.059
when you are able to do it.

00:05:19.482 --> 00:05:27.890
Like you are, say, to catch a train

00:05:28.091 --> 00:05:31.758
and you arrive late at the station,

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:36.704
you find the train is late for you.

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:43.688
Things work out in such a way that you feel

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:51.373
they are all active for your complete convenience.

00:05:51.574 --> 00:05:56.081
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

00:05:56.367 --> 00:06:00.259
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:06.286
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

00:06:06.487 --> 00:06:09.205
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

00:06:09.406 --> 00:06:11.070
you just don't do it.

00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:16.288
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

00:06:19.456 --> 00:06:22.085
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

00:06:22.286 --> 00:06:24.848
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

00:06:25.049 --> 00:06:30.679
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:38.393
either with lust,
greed, at something,

00:06:38.594 --> 00:06:42.193
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

00:06:42.394 --> 00:06:54.825
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

00:06:55.026 --> 00:06:59.744
means the attention loses its dharma.

00:07:01.046 --> 00:07:08.951
The dharma of the attention are such that

00:07:09.152 --> 00:07:14.625
we have to put

00:07:14.826 --> 00:07:20.208
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

00:07:21.459 --> 00:07:27.224
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

00:07:27.555 --> 00:07:34.777
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

00:07:34.978 --> 00:07:39.860
and when they attack us,

00:07:40.061 --> 00:07:45.463
then

00:07:45.664 --> 00:07:51.282
we have to have some measures to control it.

00:07:51.483 --> 00:07:56.451
So we build up our dharmas,

00:07:56.652 --> 00:08:00.488
our rules and regulation,

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:03.935
and control them, the dharmas,

00:08:04.136 --> 00:08:09.003
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

00:08:09.647 --> 00:08:13.407
This is the greatness of human beings,

00:08:13.608 --> 00:08:20.258
that they have made their own dharmas

00:08:20.459 --> 00:08:23.426
established on top of the lower dharmas.

00:08:23.627 --> 00:08:27.791
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

00:08:28.008 --> 00:08:30.130
It has to be in four valences;

00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:32.916
it acts according to the four valences,

00:08:33.117 --> 00:08:36.161
it cannot make it six.

00:08:36.362 --> 00:08:41.993
But human beings can make

00:08:42.194 --> 00:08:45.462
those valences established which are supposed to be

00:08:45.663 --> 00:08:50.436
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:55.788
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

00:08:55.989 --> 00:08:58.903
means, you don't have need,

00:08:59.104 --> 00:09:02.196
there’s no need,

00:09:02.397 --> 00:09:06.836
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

00:09:07.037 --> 00:09:09.164
You don't have to discipline,

00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:12.696
but you get disciplined automatically.

00:09:12.897 --> 00:09:16.346
That is the first sign of a person

00:09:16.547 --> 00:09:21.932
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

00:09:22.133 --> 00:09:24.823
Attention doesn't get attached

00:09:25.024 --> 00:09:30.442
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

00:09:30.643 --> 00:09:36.244
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

00:09:39.112 --> 00:09:43.151
So you become ‘kalateet’.

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.763
You become ‘dharmateet’.

00:09:45.964 --> 00:09:49.042
You become ‘gunateet’.

00:09:49.448 --> 00:09:53.977
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

00:09:54.178 --> 00:09:58.494
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

00:09:58.695 --> 00:10:04.801
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

00:10:05.002 --> 00:10:07.658
of your attention.

00:10:07.859 --> 00:10:14.344
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

00:10:14.545 --> 00:10:19.529
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

00:10:20.354 --> 00:10:28.609
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

00:10:28.810 --> 00:10:33.936
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

00:10:34.137 --> 00:10:36.902
which is ‘satvika’.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:42.122
Where a person tries to control

00:10:42.323 --> 00:10:49.125
all his enemies of lust, anger,

00:10:49.326 --> 00:10:56.315
pride, vanity, attachments

00:10:56.516 --> 00:10:59.297
and greed.

00:11:00.312 --> 00:11:07.158
All these restrictions

00:11:07.359 --> 00:11:11.270
on the attention get lost

00:11:11.471 --> 00:11:17.798
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

00:11:17.999 --> 00:11:23.327
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

00:11:25.669 --> 00:11:33.258
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:37.910
and you become ‘satgunis’-

00:11:38.111 --> 00:11:41.769
means virtuous,

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:48.584
but not by discipline,

00:11:48.785 --> 00:11:52.270
but spontaneously.

00:11:52.471 --> 00:11:55.847
You become righteous spontaneously.

00:11:56.048 --> 00:11:59.438
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:03.917
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

00:12:04.118 --> 00:12:11.593
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

00:12:11.794 --> 00:12:15.856
in the sense, in front of the temples.

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:21.990
According to laws, we should not have temper,

00:12:22.191 --> 00:12:28.564
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

00:12:28.765 --> 00:12:32.984
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

00:12:33.185 --> 00:12:39.546
which is not to be analyzed,

00:12:39.747 --> 00:12:44.322
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

00:12:44.523 --> 00:12:49.108
the killing of the rakshasas,

00:12:49.309 --> 00:12:52.511
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

00:12:52.712 --> 00:12:56.680
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

00:12:56.881 --> 00:13:00.677
they are all dead already.

00:13:03.045 --> 00:13:06.762
They all get explained because you go beyond.

00:13:06.963 --> 00:13:11.476
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

00:13:11.677 --> 00:13:15.504
Only the one who can control is beyond.

00:13:15.705 --> 00:13:19.580
The one who is in it cannot control it.

00:13:19.981 --> 00:13:26.137
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:32.991
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

00:13:33.192 --> 00:13:37.082
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

00:13:42.349 --> 00:13:51.418
But, when it comes to the knowledge

00:13:51.619 --> 00:13:56.476
about such a person, you cannot think,

00:13:56.677 --> 00:14:04.075
because such a person is beyond thinking.

00:14:04.276 --> 00:14:07.075
You cannot describe

00:14:07.276 --> 00:14:11.955
because such a person cannot describe.

00:14:12.653 --> 00:14:18.410
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:22.853
take the poison?

00:14:25.838 --> 00:14:30.213
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

00:14:32.181 --> 00:14:36.665
That's beyond human comprehension.

00:14:37.657 --> 00:14:40.612
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

00:14:40.813 --> 00:14:44.682
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

00:14:44.883 --> 00:14:49.349
Your certificates come from God Almighty

00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:54.901
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

00:14:55.102 --> 00:15:00.922
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

00:15:08.058 --> 00:15:10.604
So you reach a state

00:15:10.805 --> 00:15:13.719
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.021
means ‘without’,

00:15:19.959 --> 00:15:22.396
without.

00:15:25.123 --> 00:15:29.792
So such a person

00:15:29.993 --> 00:15:34.383
is without thought; he doesn't think.

00:15:41.289 --> 00:15:45.246
Such a person is without greed,

00:15:45.447 --> 00:15:50.759
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

00:15:54.822 --> 00:15:58.988
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

00:15:59.189 --> 00:16:08.495
out of which nothing is left out.

00:16:08.696 --> 00:16:12.722
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

00:16:12.923 --> 00:16:16.663
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

00:16:16.864 --> 00:16:21.465
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

00:16:21.666 --> 00:16:25.390
because it reaches a point all the time

00:16:25.591 --> 00:16:30.210
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

00:16:30.411 --> 00:16:34.114
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

00:16:34.539 --> 00:16:40.273
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

00:16:42.606 --> 00:16:48.996
Vacuum of all the negative,

00:16:49.197 --> 00:16:55.866
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:06.522
Such a person is eternal being.

00:17:06.742 --> 00:17:11.322
Nobody can kill,

00:17:11.523 --> 00:17:17.397
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:24.368
The anger

00:17:24.569 --> 00:17:30.434
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

00:17:30.635 --> 00:17:34.563
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

00:17:34.764 --> 00:17:46.656
He is not elated by praises

00:17:46.857 --> 00:17:52.701
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

00:17:52.902 --> 00:17:56.987
the boons of the ego.

00:18:08.827 --> 00:18:15.154
So the third state where he reaches,

00:18:15.355 --> 00:18:21.059
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.145
Nihi.

00:18:25.993 --> 00:18:31.268
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

00:18:31.469 --> 00:18:37.195
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

00:18:37.396 --> 00:18:41.083
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

00:18:42.012 --> 00:18:44.692
But the word is 'Nihi'.

00:18:44.893 --> 00:18:48.447
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

00:18:51.375 --> 00:18:53.565
‘nih’ -

00:18:53.766 --> 00:18:59.885
that means

00:19:00.086 --> 00:19:02.742
‘sheer’.

00:19:06.812 --> 00:19:14.452
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

00:19:17.563 --> 00:19:24.157
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

00:19:24.358 --> 00:19:31.592
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

00:19:37.760 --> 00:19:44.793
Like when you say

00:19:44.994 --> 00:19:52.834
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

00:19:53.035 --> 00:19:55.449
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

00:19:55.650 --> 00:20:00.939
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

00:20:03.695 --> 00:20:07.765
But this word is used,

00:20:07.966 --> 00:20:11.108
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

00:20:11.309 --> 00:20:20.077
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

00:20:20.278 --> 00:20:26.239
without or devoid of.

00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:31.949
The another form is:

00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:35.595
the only - absolute;

00:20:38.868 --> 00:20:41.422
the absolute.

00:20:42.946 --> 00:20:48.255
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

00:20:48.456 --> 00:20:51.124
nothing but joy.

00:20:51.325 --> 00:20:54.301
It's complete freedom.

00:20:54.723 --> 00:20:58.638
So you have all kinds of joys,

00:20:58.839 --> 00:21:05.067
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

00:21:05.268 --> 00:21:09.088
the joy of the Spirit.

00:21:10.541 --> 00:21:17.259
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

00:21:18.503 --> 00:21:21.491
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

00:21:21.692 --> 00:21:26.465
where you have the joy of the play.

00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.692
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

00:21:33.893 --> 00:21:36.565
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

00:21:36.766 --> 00:21:40.797
means, sheer absolute joy.

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:46.212
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

00:21:46.413 --> 00:21:49.691
it means absolute.

00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.873
So when you put such an adjective before

00:21:53.074 --> 00:21:56.764
anything else it becomes absolute.

00:22:08.188 --> 00:22:11.867
Thus you become absolute.

00:22:15.055 --> 00:22:20.784
And when you are at that state of absolute

00:22:20.985 --> 00:22:27.195
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

00:22:33.837 --> 00:22:37.868
But let us see what is absolute.

00:22:43.293 --> 00:22:47.373
That means it is not relative;

00:22:47.574 --> 00:22:49.928
it has no relative qualities.

00:22:50.129 --> 00:22:55.279
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.190
it cannot be compared.

00:22:59.380 --> 00:23:04.044
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

00:23:07.174 --> 00:23:10.672
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

00:23:10.873 --> 00:23:14.407
anything else through which we can comprehend;

00:23:14.608 --> 00:23:17.287
it is absolute.

00:23:21.600 --> 00:23:27.524
Whatever way you try to know it

00:23:27.725 --> 00:23:31.935
you go away from absolute.

00:23:35.358 --> 00:23:42.843
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

00:23:53.125 --> 00:23:58.574
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.136
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

00:24:04.337 --> 00:24:08.475
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

00:24:08.676 --> 00:24:13.129
means the anand of the body,

00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:21.824
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

00:24:25.874 --> 00:24:28.654
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

00:24:28.855 --> 00:24:33.245
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

00:24:35.183 --> 00:24:38.597
But the state has now

00:24:38.798 --> 00:24:42.784
to be established within us is of Niranand.

00:24:44.057 --> 00:24:48.510
Then what is the question of fear?

00:24:51.284 --> 00:24:54.202
What is the question of talking about it?

00:24:54.403 --> 00:24:59.287
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

00:24:59.488 --> 00:25:03.972
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

00:25:05.612 --> 00:25:08.703
There are no words for absolute to describe.

00:25:08.904 --> 00:25:11.523
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

00:25:11.724 --> 00:25:15.091
what remains is absolute.

00:25:18.512 --> 00:25:22.879
So you reach the state of absolute.

00:25:25.965 --> 00:25:28.410
And that is the state

00:25:28.611 --> 00:25:33.568
a complete communication is established

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:38.505
and in that communication you have nobody else

00:25:38.706 --> 00:25:41.979
but the absolute within you.

00:25:48.747 --> 00:25:52.793
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

00:25:53.660 --> 00:25:58.167
That is the level to which you should aspire.

00:25:59.677 --> 00:26:04.944
That should be the ascent,

00:26:05.145 --> 00:26:09.676
which should be established within ourselves.

00:26:10.793 --> 00:26:13.227
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

00:26:13.428 --> 00:26:16.846
we don't have to do anything drastic.

00:26:17.047 --> 00:26:22.508
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

00:26:22.709 --> 00:26:26.630
the only, ‘kevalam’.

00:26:31.431 --> 00:26:36.720
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

00:26:38.983 --> 00:26:45.881
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

00:26:46.082 --> 00:26:52.074
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

00:26:52.687 --> 00:26:57.413
Just by surrendering you become.

00:26:58.975 --> 00:27:02.915
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

00:27:03.116 --> 00:27:10.280
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

00:27:11.561 --> 00:27:14.970
It is absolute love,

00:27:15.171 --> 00:27:18.671
it is absolute compassion;

00:27:18.872 --> 00:27:22.702
it is absolute power.

00:27:35.820 --> 00:27:38.126
The words stop,

00:27:38.327 --> 00:27:42.702
the description stops;

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:47.690
you just become the absolute

00:27:47.891 --> 00:27:54.737
and feel your absoluteness through it

00:27:54.938 --> 00:27:58.328
with that oneness.

00:28:00.227 --> 00:28:05.234
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:10.003
There’s no company needed.

00:28:10.204 --> 00:28:16.407
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

00:28:22.335 --> 00:28:28.879
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:35.415
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

00:28:40.713 --> 00:28:44.112
May God bless you.
