WEBVTT

01:34.719 --> 01:47.739
Today in this beautiful place created by the queen of Austria,

01:47.940 --> 01:53.742
we have gathered here

01:53.943 --> 02:01.107
to perform the Puja to the Sahasrara.

02:06.711 --> 02:10.200
When we enter into the realm of Sahasrara,

02:10.401 --> 02:15.348
then only we have right to do the Sahasrara Puja.

02:15.549 --> 02:20.621
Before this, nobody talked about Sahasrara

02:20.822 --> 02:25.337
nobody did any Puja to Sahasrara.

02:25.538 --> 02:32.166
This is your privilege that you are in the realm of Sahasrara

02:32.367 --> 02:38.234
and that you can do this Puja performed.

02:38.862 --> 02:41.385
It's your right.

02:41.596 --> 02:45.401
You are chosen for this.

02:45.861 --> 02:49.554
It’s a very privileged place for you to enter into

02:49.755 --> 02:52.020
the Sahasrara of the Viraat,

02:52.221 --> 02:59.572
to reside in the brain as cells of that Sahasrara.

03:02.596 --> 03:11.439
Let us see what is the quality of the cells of Sahasrara.

03:21.776 --> 03:27.254
These are specially created cells

03:27.455 --> 03:31.376
through the working of the Swadishthana.

03:31.706 --> 03:35.774
Passing through all the chakras,

03:35.975 --> 03:39.071
when they arrive at Sahasrara

03:39.272 --> 03:47.503
they are equipped to handle the brain's activity

03:47.704 --> 03:56.678
without getting involved into

03:56.879 --> 04:01.419
other elements in the body.

04:04.878 --> 04:10.849
In the same way the Sahaja Yogis

04:11.050 --> 04:18.068
are not to be involved with the other cells -

04:18.269 --> 04:22.270
human beings,

04:22.471 --> 04:26.830
of the body of this universe.

04:31.402 --> 04:35.734
The first thing that happens

04:35.935 --> 04:39.940
to a Sahaja Yogi at the Sahasrara level that

04:40.141 --> 04:45.008
he becomes beyond – ‘ateet’.

04:45.540 --> 04:49.519
So, many things he transcends:

04:49.720 --> 04:53.493
‘kalateet’- he goes beyond time.

04:53.694 --> 04:56.936
Time is his slave.

04:57.694 --> 05:01.050
If you have to go somewhere

05:01.251 --> 05:07.361
then suddenly you discover

05:07.562 --> 05:15.179
that everything is working about the same time

05:15.380 --> 05:19.059
when you are able to do it.

05:19.482 --> 05:27.890
Like you are, say, to catch a train

05:28.091 --> 05:31.758
and you arrive late at the station,

05:31.959 --> 05:36.704
you find the train is late for you.

05:38.639 --> 05:43.688
Things work out in such a way that you feel

05:43.889 --> 05:51.373
they are all active for your complete convenience.

05:51.574 --> 05:56.081
So you go beyond time - ‘kalateet’.

05:56.367 --> 06:00.259
Then you go beyond dharma - ‘dharmateet’.

06:00.460 --> 06:06.286
Means, dharma becomes part and parcel of your being.

06:06.487 --> 06:09.205
Nobody has to tell you, ‘you do this or you do that’;

06:09.406 --> 06:11.070
you just don't do it.

06:11.271 --> 06:16.288
Whatever you have to do it, you do it.

06:19.456 --> 06:22.085
When you go beyond all these dharmas,

06:22.286 --> 06:24.848
that are the human ‘dharmas’-

06:25.049 --> 06:30.679
human dharma is that his attention gets attracted

06:30.880 --> 06:38.393
either with lust,
greed, at something,

06:38.594 --> 06:42.193
and then he cannot pull out his attention.

06:42.394 --> 06:54.825
But now the attention becomes ‘dharmateet’ -

06:55.026 --> 06:59.744
means the attention loses its dharma.

07:01.046 --> 07:08.951
The dharma of the attention are such that

07:09.152 --> 07:14.625
we have to put

07:14.826 --> 07:20.208
the ‘dharmas’ taught by the prophets to control them.

07:21.459 --> 07:27.224
Because we are coming from the lowest level.

07:27.555 --> 07:34.777
So these dharmas exist in our being and start showing,

07:34.978 --> 07:39.860
and when they attack us,

07:40.061 --> 07:45.463
then

07:45.664 --> 07:51.282
we have to have some measures to control it.

07:51.483 --> 07:56.451
So we build up our dharmas,

07:56.652 --> 08:00.488
our rules and regulation,

08:00.689 --> 08:03.935
and control them, the dharmas,

08:04.136 --> 08:09.003
which have come to us from lower conditioning.

08:09.647 --> 08:13.407
This is the greatness of human beings,

08:13.608 --> 08:20.258
that they have made their own dharmas

08:20.459 --> 08:23.426
established on top of the lower dharmas.

08:23.627 --> 08:27.791
Like carbon has, say, four valences.

08:28.008 --> 08:30.130
It has to be in four valences;

08:30.331 --> 08:32.916
it acts according to the four valences,

08:33.117 --> 08:36.161
it cannot make it six.

08:36.362 --> 08:41.993
But human beings can make

08:42.194 --> 08:45.462
those valences established which are supposed to be

08:45.663 --> 08:50.436
representing the human dharma, the ‘manavdharma’.

08:50.761 --> 08:55.788
But with the Sahasrara ascent the attention loses that quality,

08:55.989 --> 08:58.903
means, you don't have need,

08:59.104 --> 09:02.196
there’s no need,

09:02.397 --> 09:06.836
to put dharmas - restrictions upon yourself.

09:07.037 --> 09:09.164
You don't have to discipline,

09:09.365 --> 09:12.696
but you get disciplined automatically.

09:12.897 --> 09:16.346
That is the first sign of a person

09:16.547 --> 09:21.932
who is belonging to Nirmal Religion. That is pure.

09:22.133 --> 09:24.823
Attention doesn't get attached

09:25.024 --> 09:30.442
or attacked by anything whatsoever, it is so pure.

09:30.643 --> 09:36.244
Like the lotus leaf, the water doesn't stay on it.

09:39.112 --> 09:43.151
So you become ‘kalateet’.

09:43.670 --> 09:45.763
You become ‘dharmateet’.

09:45.964 --> 09:49.042
You become ‘gunateet’.

09:49.448 --> 09:53.977
Means, the three moods in which you are born,

09:54.178 --> 09:58.494
left, right and center, you go beyond them.

09:58.695 --> 10:04.801
The left one is the one by which you have emotional attachments

10:05.002 --> 10:07.658
of your attention.

10:07.859 --> 10:14.344
The second one is the physical and the mental attachments

10:14.545 --> 10:19.529
and the third one, the attachment to the dharma.

10:20.354 --> 10:28.609
Attachment to be righteous and making other righteous;

10:28.810 --> 10:33.936
of disciplining others and disciplining yourself,

10:34.137 --> 10:36.902
which is ‘satvika’.

10:37.220 --> 10:42.122
Where a person tries to control

10:42.323 --> 10:49.125
all his enemies of lust, anger,

10:49.326 --> 10:56.315
pride, vanity, attachments

10:56.516 --> 10:59.297
and greed.

11:00.312 --> 11:07.158
All these restrictions

11:07.359 --> 11:11.270
on the attention get lost

11:11.471 --> 11:17.798
and you become a free person of complete wisdom.

11:17.999 --> 11:23.327
Your attention itself becomes ‘dharmic’.

11:25.669 --> 11:33.258
So, you lose all your ‘gunas’

11:33.459 --> 11:37.910
and you become ‘satgunis’-

11:38.111 --> 11:41.769
means virtuous,

11:41.970 --> 11:48.584
but not by discipline,

11:48.785 --> 11:52.270
but spontaneously.

11:52.471 --> 11:55.847
You become righteous spontaneously.

11:56.048 --> 11:59.438
Sometimes such people puzzle you;

11:59.639 --> 12:03.917
like Christ took a hunter in His hand

12:04.118 --> 12:11.593
and beat people who were selling things in the presence of God,

12:11.794 --> 12:15.856
in the sense, in front of the temples.

12:17.769 --> 12:21.990
According to laws, we should not have temper,

12:22.191 --> 12:28.564
but this temper is a temper of a ‘gunateet’

12:28.765 --> 12:32.984
and such a temper is a spontaneous happening,

12:33.185 --> 12:39.546
which is not to be analyzed,

12:39.747 --> 12:44.322
has to happen. The temper of the Devi on the rakshasas,

12:44.523 --> 12:49.108
the killing of the rakshasas,

12:49.309 --> 12:52.511
Krishna's samharas [MEANS killings],

12:52.712 --> 12:56.680
Krishna telling Arjuna that you have to kill all these people,

12:56.881 --> 13:00.677
they are all dead already.

13:03.045 --> 13:06.762
They all get explained because you go beyond.

13:06.963 --> 13:11.476
So is the 'ateet' beyond conditions arise.

13:11.677 --> 13:15.504
Only the one who can control is beyond.

13:15.705 --> 13:19.580
The one who is in it cannot control it.

13:19.981 --> 13:26.137
If you have to pull out the ship you have to be on the shore.

13:26.338 --> 13:32.991
The one who has gone beyond can only do that.

13:33.192 --> 13:37.082
So you go beyond, that is ‘ateet’.

13:42.349 --> 13:51.418
But, when it comes to the knowledge

13:51.619 --> 13:56.476
about such a person, you cannot think,

13:56.677 --> 14:04.075
because such a person is beyond thinking.

14:04.276 --> 14:07.075
You cannot describe

14:07.276 --> 14:11.955
because such a person cannot describe.

14:12.653 --> 14:18.410
You cannot say, “Why Socrates agreed to

14:18.611 --> 14:22.853
take the poison?

14:25.838 --> 14:30.213
Why Christ agreed to get crucified?”

14:32.181 --> 14:36.665
That's beyond human comprehension.

14:37.657 --> 14:40.612
That's how you behave beyond human comprehension

14:40.813 --> 14:44.682
and you are not to take certificates from human beings.

14:44.883 --> 14:49.349
Your certificates come from God Almighty

14:49.550 --> 14:54.901
and not from these human beings who are at a lower level.

14:55.102 --> 15:00.922
It would be like a dog writing about human beings.

15:08.058 --> 15:10.604
So you reach a state

15:10.805 --> 15:13.719
where it can be described with the word ‘a’,

15:13.920 --> 15:17.021
means ‘without’,

15:19.959 --> 15:22.396
without.

15:25.123 --> 15:29.792
So such a person

15:29.993 --> 15:34.383
is without thought; he doesn't think.

15:41.289 --> 15:45.246
Such a person is without greed,

15:45.447 --> 15:50.759
such a person is without lust - devoid of.

15:54.822 --> 15:58.988
Such a person is said to be ‘ashesh’-

15:59.189 --> 16:08.495
out of which nothing is left out.

16:08.696 --> 16:12.722
Like when you want to make a vacuum,

16:12.923 --> 16:16.663
you go on making the, creating the vacuum,

16:16.864 --> 16:21.465
reach any point and the vacuum cannot be complete

16:21.666 --> 16:25.390
because it reaches a point all the time

16:25.591 --> 16:30.210
where you find some part of it has to be remained.

16:30.411 --> 16:34.114
You cannot have a complete vacuum.

16:34.539 --> 16:40.273
But such a person has a complete vacuum.

16:42.606 --> 16:48.996
Vacuum of all the negative,

16:49.197 --> 16:55.866
aggressive qualities doesn't exist, complete.

17:02.460 --> 17:06.522
Such a person is eternal being.

17:06.742 --> 17:11.322
Nobody can kill,

17:11.523 --> 17:17.397
nobody can harm, nobody can hurt.

17:18.533 --> 17:24.368
The anger

17:24.569 --> 17:30.434
of anyone or respect of anyone does not touch such a person.

17:30.635 --> 17:34.563
He is not disturbed by insults or non-insults.

17:34.764 --> 17:46.656
He is not elated by praises

17:46.857 --> 17:52.701
because he is devoid of the capacity to enjoy

17:52.902 --> 17:56.987
the boons of the ego.

18:08.827 --> 18:15.154
So the third state where he reaches,

18:15.355 --> 18:21.059
he gets the blessing of the word ‘Nihi’ –

18:21.260 --> 18:23.145
Nihi.

18:25.993 --> 18:31.268
‘Nihi’ is the first word of My name.

18:31.469 --> 18:37.195
But in Sanskrit, when you combine it with, ‘Mala’,

18:37.396 --> 18:41.083
then it becomes 'Nirmala’.

18:42.012 --> 18:44.692
But the word is 'Nihi'.

18:44.893 --> 18:48.447
‘Ni’ which shakes little.

18:51.375 --> 18:53.565
‘nih’ -

18:53.766 --> 18:59.885
that means

19:00.086 --> 19:02.742
‘sheer’.

19:06.812 --> 19:14.452
Or when a ‘i’ is added to it.

19:17.563 --> 19:24.157
But the first ‘nihi’ means without - devoid

19:24.358 --> 19:31.592
and ‘Nira’ means sheer.

19:37.760 --> 19:44.793
Like when you say

19:44.994 --> 19:52.834
‘nirananda’, ‘niratma’ - sheer ‘atma’,

19:53.035 --> 19:55.449
sheer joy. ‘Kevelam’ -

19:55.650 --> 20:00.939
the only, there’s nothing but joy.

20:03.695 --> 20:07.765
But this word is used,

20:07.966 --> 20:11.108
‘nira’ or ‘nihi’,

20:11.309 --> 20:20.077
used in two forms as I told you. One for say,

20:20.278 --> 20:26.239
without or devoid of.

20:26.440 --> 20:31.949
The another form is:

20:32.150 --> 20:35.595
the only - absolute;

20:38.868 --> 20:41.422
the absolute.

20:42.946 --> 20:48.255
So here the joy becomes ‘nirananda’, absolute joy,

20:48.456 --> 20:51.124
nothing but joy.

20:51.325 --> 20:54.301
It's complete freedom.

20:54.723 --> 20:58.638
So you have all kinds of joys,

20:58.839 --> 21:05.067
as I told you before, you have ‘Swanand’-

21:05.268 --> 21:09.088
the joy of the Spirit.

21:10.541 --> 21:17.259
Then you have got ‘Brahmananda’ - the joy of well-being.

21:18.503 --> 21:21.491
You've got ‘Leelananda’, ‘Krishnananda’-

21:21.692 --> 21:26.465
where you have the joy of the play.

21:30.200 --> 21:33.692
But when you reach the state of Sahasrara

21:33.893 --> 21:36.565
it is ‘Nirananda’ -

21:36.766 --> 21:40.797
means, sheer absolute joy.

21:42.434 --> 21:46.212
Though the name ‘Nira’ is My name,

21:46.413 --> 21:49.691
it means absolute.

21:50.420 --> 21:52.873
So when you put such an adjective before

21:53.074 --> 21:56.764
anything else it becomes absolute.

22:08.188 --> 22:11.867
Thus you become absolute.

22:15.055 --> 22:20.784
And when you are at that state of absolute

22:20.985 --> 22:27.195
then there is no place for anything else to be there but yourself.

22:33.837 --> 22:37.868
But let us see what is absolute.

22:43.293 --> 22:47.373
That means it is not relative;

22:47.574 --> 22:49.928
it has no relative qualities.

22:50.129 --> 22:55.279
Absolute cannot be compared, ‘atulaniya’ -

22:55.480 --> 22:58.190
it cannot be compared.

22:59.380 --> 23:04.044
It cannot be related to anything, it is absolute.

23:07.174 --> 23:10.672
It cannot be comprehended because it cannot be related to

23:10.873 --> 23:14.407
anything else through which we can comprehend;

23:14.608 --> 23:17.287
it is absolute.

23:21.600 --> 23:27.524
Whatever way you try to know it

23:27.725 --> 23:31.935
you go away from absolute.

23:35.358 --> 23:42.843
Wherever you try to analyze the absolute you are away from it.

23:53.125 --> 23:58.574
So this is what at Sahasrara you get – ‘Niranand’.

24:00.630 --> 24:04.136
In different stages of Sahaja Yoga

24:04.337 --> 24:08.475
we had to start from ‘shariranand’,

24:08.676 --> 24:13.129
means the anand of the body,

24:14.520 --> 24:21.824
‘manasanand’ - the joy of the ‘manasa’- is the psyche.

24:25.874 --> 24:28.654
Then you can say ‘ahamkaranand’,

24:28.855 --> 24:33.245
where you have to have the satisfaction of the ego.

24:35.183 --> 24:38.597
But the state has now

24:38.798 --> 24:42.784
to be established within us is of Niranand.

24:44.057 --> 24:48.510
Then what is the question of fear?

24:51.284 --> 24:54.202
What is the question of talking about it?

24:54.403 --> 24:59.287
You cannot talk, because
how will you relate it?

24:59.488 --> 25:03.972
I cannot say, “It is like this, it is like that”.

25:05.612 --> 25:08.703
There are no words for absolute to describe.

25:08.904 --> 25:11.523
Only by negation, ‘not this, not this, not this’,

25:11.724 --> 25:15.091
what remains is absolute.

25:18.512 --> 25:22.879
So you reach the state of absolute.

25:25.965 --> 25:28.410
And that is the state

25:28.611 --> 25:33.568
a complete communication is established

25:33.769 --> 25:38.505
and in that communication you have nobody else

25:38.706 --> 25:41.979
but the absolute within you.

25:48.747 --> 25:52.793
That is the Sahasrar Puja you are here for.

25:53.660 --> 25:58.167
That is the level to which you should aspire.

25:59.677 --> 26:04.944
That should be the ascent,

26:05.145 --> 26:09.676
which should be established within ourselves.

26:10.793 --> 26:13.227
We don't have to go to Himalayas,

26:13.428 --> 26:16.846
we don't have to do anything drastic.

26:17.047 --> 26:22.508
Remaining in this world we have to become the absolute -

26:22.709 --> 26:26.630
the only, ‘kevalam’.

26:31.431 --> 26:36.720
There is nothing like ‘how?’ for it, you just become.

26:38.983 --> 26:45.881
You just become, like a flowers becomes a fruit.

26:46.082 --> 26:52.074
It's all built in, within you. Allow it to work out.

26:52.687 --> 26:57.413
Just by surrendering you become.

26:58.975 --> 27:02.915
Surrender it and you'll be surprised

27:03.116 --> 27:10.280
you will be at the state where you will enjoy your absoluteness.

27:11.561 --> 27:14.970
It is absolute love,

27:15.171 --> 27:18.671
it is absolute compassion;

27:18.872 --> 27:22.702
it is absolute power.

27:35.820 --> 27:38.126
The words stop,

27:38.327 --> 27:42.702
the description stops;

27:44.640 --> 27:47.690
you just become the absolute

27:47.891 --> 27:54.737
and feel your absoluteness through it

27:54.938 --> 27:58.328
with that oneness.

28:00.227 --> 28:05.234
If somebody is not with you, you don't worry.

28:06.860 --> 28:10.003
There’s no company needed.

28:10.204 --> 28:16.407
You're alone, enjoying the absolute.

28:22.335 --> 28:28.879
There only you can enjoy the absolute in others also,

28:29.080 --> 28:35.415
in the best form without seeing anything else but the absolute.

28:40.713 --> 28:44.112
May God bless you.
