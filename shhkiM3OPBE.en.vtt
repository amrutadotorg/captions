00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.680
Sorry, I had to say something before entering in,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.560
but it is good that it has happened,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.240
because now I have to tell you some things important in life

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.040
and that is specially for ladies I have to tell this.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.720
I've noticed - of course, I am also a woman

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.400
that women have certain water powers of crying, weeping

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.720
and, thinking they're very miserable

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.800
and making everybody miserable. This is their power.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.000
I've noticed this. I mean this song is the worst song

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.400
you could sing on any day whatsoever,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.720
but it has come into somebody's head,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.640
is very negative and not only that,

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.480
but it shows a person who can never be happy

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.720
and doesn't want anybody to be happy.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.640
So inside every woman, there is a motherhood,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.240
there's great capacities,

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.560
sacrifice, everything is there.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.880
With that, they also should know they're left-sided.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.160
And our joy about which we talk

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.400
within our heart

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.800
has to manifest outside.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.480
People should see that we are joyous,

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.960
that we are happy people,

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.240
that we are not like others who start crying for small things.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.960
Like when My father died,

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:56.640
I was surprised that suddenly I became thoughtless,

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.800
absolutely thoughtless.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.800
For about three days I was thoughtless.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.720
Neither the thought of pain

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.240
or the thought of unhappiness or anything came up,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.720
but just thoughtless.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.080
And everybody was surprised

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.720
because I looked after him and, I mean, he was very attached to Me,

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.880
very fond of me, everything was there.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.960
They were surprised how easily I became suddenly thoughtless.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.320
So if you are a Sahaja Yogini,

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.320
then at the time of crisis

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.800
you should become thoughtless. That's one of the signs.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.160
I have seen with Myself, if there is any crisis in the family,

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.720
I just become thoughtless. That means what?

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.240
That God just takes you in your problems.

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.880
He puts his hand, He puts His protection

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.160
and He takes you out of it

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.960
and makes you absolutely thoughtless.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.960
And in that thoughtless

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.800
awareness you discover what is right, what is wrong.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.880
So even in crisis,

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.720
this thoughtless awareness

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.320
is all the time extremely alert.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.160
It becomes much more alert than normal.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.640
That's the sign of a Sahaja Yogi and sign of Sahaja Yogini.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.720
But I’ve noticed it, very surprisingly,

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.240
specially with French, Indian girls, who came here.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.040
I was shocked that they were very left-sided,

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.280
crying type, nonsensical

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.600
and to hear this song again I was surprised,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.120
“How could they sing such a song from France?”

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.800
As it is, France, you know, the problem is

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.720
they drink such a lot.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.040
I’m sorry today the French have done this beautiful thing,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.720
but I better tell.

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.800
Now when they drink, they think they are very happy,

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.080
they’re very joyous,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.280
but you know how long it lasts? It just finishes off

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.960
and they suffer.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.680
But as a result of drinking, they become very left-sided

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.520
and if you see a Frenchman, he’s always unhappy.

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.920
Even to say that he’s happy,

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.480
he feels shy because people will think he is ignoramus.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.680
So he should be a miserable person "Les Misérables".

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.320
If he’s not, then he’s not French.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.120
We are not. We are in the Kingdom of God.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.600
In no way we are unhappy, in no way.

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:41.840
Some things happen in life after all.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.520
Life is such. Somebody has to die.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:47.600
Everybody doesn’t die together. Imagine everybody dies.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.560
What will happen to people? Who will bury us?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.200
I mean, think of if you are all born together,

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.080
who’ll deliver us?

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.560
So everybody who is born has to die,

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.360
but the way they have made the death as some sort of

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:16.320
a big part of life. It’s just a moment,

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:21.240
just a moment that you pass out

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:26.480
and you go and change and come back again.

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.840
But in this life, if you have to do anything, is to enjoy.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.920
So, for that, their philosophy is

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.200
that you should go to pubs

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.560
because, God knows, when we die what will happen.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.240
So they use it in the other way.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.320
This is English. I’m not saying the French.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.080
But in India, when somebody die,

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:58.920
they get bands and all kinds of music

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:03.680
and they go on playing in front of the dead body.

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.200
And why they play?

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.680
Because if there are bhoots or anything, they will all run away.

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:19.320
Also that you should not feel sad.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.200
Accept what God has done for you is for your good.

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.440
And then they have a big dinner,

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:35.000
one day after tenth or thirteenth day,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:38.240
very big dinner has to be given.

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.040
It’s very surprising, you know,

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:44.840
that country which is so poor, such a problem.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.760
If the father dies, then the whole family becomes like an orphan,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.320
orphanage.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:54.560
Despite all that,

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:58.240
they don’t wear any black dress,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.280
otherwise I have seen here people wearing black dresses.

00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.800
And a lady was very upset.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.840
She said, “The bank will open at ten o’clock

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.920
and I have to go to the funeral

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.080
and my ornaments are in the bank.”

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.520
But I said, “But ornaments you don’t wear for a funeral, do you?”

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.920
“No, no, I have my special ones.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.880
You know, I have got very nice dark, black ones.”

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.400
I said – and the best part of it, the day they die

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.600
they must have champagne.

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:36.000
When the person dies: champagne.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.840
When they come back home, they must have lunch and a big party.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.360
So it’s such a contradictory life

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:48.080
that we have been because in Christian religion

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.400
they have not said much about the death.

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:53.480
I mean, Christ, if they had allowed Him to live,

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.640
He would have talked about it.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.880
But He has said that Spirit is eternal.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:02.080
He has talked of reincarnation, no doubt,

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:05.600
but these people didn’t tell about this.

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:11.080
So death means now that that man is lost forever

00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:14.160
or this life is lost forever.

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:18.200
Then we hang in the limbo or we hang somewhere else.

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.800
We never come back.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.720
This is absolutely wrong. It’s not so.

00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:27.400
So what you have to achieve in this lifetime,

00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.760
the highest thing is your ascent

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:36.680
and your position in the Kingdom of God.

00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.800
For, especially for ladies, I have to tell you

00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.560
because, you see, reading all these tragic things all over,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.240
so many tragedies are brought up,

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.560
this Greek tragedy, this tragedy, that tragedy.

00:08:50.720 --> 00:08:57.160
It just starts working in the nerves of the ladies.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.920
If somebody says the slightest thing,

00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:01.720
it becomes like a bombshell.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.080
They just start behaving as if

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:08.640
“Oh, my God, what has happened?

00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.000
He should not have said this to me.”

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:18.720
But what we do to ourselves, we should see first.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:24.400
What harm we do to ourselves, we never cry for that.

00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:28.320
You have seen how in the West women have ruined themselves.

00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.320
They never cry for that, never, never.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:35.320
But they cry if somebody says even a little word to them.

00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:38.160
Of course, in India also.

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.840
But there are very sensible women,

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.520
otherwise, I have seen in the East and West

00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.960
who have a great sense of bearing,

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:51.720
a majestic attitude towards life.

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:53.800
Like an elephant is walking

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.040
and the dogs are barking, so what does it matter?

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.400
That majesty comes when inside you have that joy.

00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:05.520
“Nobody can make me unhappy.”

00:10:06.280 --> 00:10:08.320
This is – should be the principle.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.760
“Nothing can make me unhappy.”

00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:13.760
Otherwise, you start moving towards the left side.

00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.320
When a lady starts crying and a man starts going to the left

00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.080
and suddenly you find ten bhoots sitting on him.

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.600
How does he get it? “I’ve never been to a cemetery.

00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:28.080
I’ve never been to any such place, Mother.

00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.240
I never saw anybody dying.”

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:32.560
“Then how did you get bhootish?”

00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.400
“I never went to any guru.”

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:37.240
See the wife.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:40.560
Wife is a crying doll.

00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.560
For everything she cries.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.480
If you don’t do this, cry.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:51.680
This is another kind of ego expression, I tell you

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.160
this crying business.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.720
So today I want to have a promise from all of you

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:59.800
that you are not going to cry at all.

00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.640
Instead of flowers, you just give me this flower

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.320
of promise.

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:10.960
I never cry. Of course, sometimes Sandra karuna,

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:14.400
one tear or two tears might come out of My

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.440
– after all, I’m a mother.

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:22.480
But not like this – sitting, crying, crying, becoming hysterics.

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.000
You must have your dignity. You are all Sahaja Yoginis.

00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.360
Don’t read any book which talks of crying,

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.720
but books which are deep

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:39.600
also make you feel very much touched.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.680
You feel like crying, it’s all right.

00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.160
In the cinema they see a woman torturing her husband,

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:48.720
then they will cry.

00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:53.320
At home they’ll come and torture the husband. What’s the use?

00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.640
I’ve seen many like that.

00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.560
In the cinema they’ll be crying.

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:02.200
When it is somebody else, they feel the pain.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:05.400
When it is themselves, they never see what they are doing.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:12.400
So My one demand today is that

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.800
you must not cry.

00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:18.160
Now you are in the Kingdom of God

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:22.960
and in the Kingdom of God you do not cry.

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:25.920
Now we had All Saints Day. We had this, that.

00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:28.840
They used to do all in India also they have nonsense like that.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:32.000
All right, give them their due,

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.640
but you don’t celebrate by crying.

00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:42.080
That is one sign that you are really joyous.

00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.680
I mean, what a song to hear and I was shocked.

00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:49.880
Who suggested the song? Can I ask the culprit?

00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:58.440
I know that must have been an Indian woman. Has to be.

00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:04.160
[Speaks in Hindi.]

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.800
So look at these beautiful things that they have created.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.000
If there was no beauty within themselves,

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.760
they would have been sitting and crying.

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.680
What else? Of course,

00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:31.120
those people are beautiful – they never cry.

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:34.800
Maybe crocodile tears sometimes, just to show off,

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.920
but inside they don’t cry

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.640
because they’re so confident.

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.920
They enjoy their beauty. They enjoy their glory.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.800
They enjoy themselves. Why should they cry? What is the need?

00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:53.120
And such wasted tears are of no use.

00:13:54.080 --> 00:13:59.720
So it is today we are here to enjoy our joy,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:03.240
our Atmananda, Nirananda and Paramananda.

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.960
All these we are here to enjoy,

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.600
which are of eternal value.

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.840
You have to understand that

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:18.560
now believe that you are in the Kingdom of God

00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:23.400
and all the subtle beauties of your being

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.640
are going to be opened out to you.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.080
You are going to see yourself all the beauty.

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.680
But here, if your eyes are already closed,

00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:32.480
if your heart is already closed

00:14:32.640 --> 00:14:35.480
and you don’t want to see something that’s so beautiful,

00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:40.240
how can I say what a beautiful thing they have made?

00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:45.320
Is a very important thing in life,

00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:50.720
is to have a very positive attitude.

00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.320
For Sahaja Yoga also.

00:14:54.600 --> 00:15:01.720
In Sahaja Yoga we have to develop ourselves within.

00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:04.600
But that’s not so. People will say,

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.600
“My mother is sick, my father is sick,

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.400
my brother is sick, my this thing, that one is sick.”

00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.640
First, first thing is this.

00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:16.760
I mean, sometimes I used to think that I’ll have to

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:21.040
just start a hospital instead of an ashram.

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.320
Then the second is “My husband is like this.

00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:30.800
My children are like this. My this thing is like that.”

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:35.160
This “my my my” is not you.

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:37.520
What are you?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:40.800
You are a Sahaja Yogini

00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:49.120
and in Sahaj you have to know that you have all the proofs,

00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:55.080
everything before you to know that you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:00.240
Now if I know that I am Adi Shakti, supposing,

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.280
if I know I am Adi Shakti, then I know,

00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.720
then I don’t have to ask any help from anybody.

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:19.720
After all, I am Adi Shakti. I am supposed to do everything.

00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:28.440
That’s My job because I have that power

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:32.880
and I have that power, just sahaj,

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:38.400
I have that power with Me. So I have to do it.

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:42.240
Now, I can also say I’m a woman. I should sit down and cry.

00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:47.120
No, I have no right. I cannot do it, even if I want to.

00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:52.360
My job is to encourage you to tell you

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.800
about your inner subtleties, your beauty.

00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.040
Now do you know what beautiful thing you are?

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:04.320
Let us talk about our inner beauty.

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.720
What are we?

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:13.720
Are we all these mad people?

00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:20.280
Are we all these people who are all the time are miserable?

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:24.720
Or are we all these people who are always fighting,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.920
those who are hankering after things,

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:33.760
whom this matter dominates?

00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:40.600
No, we are the Spirit.

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.280
We are the Spirit. We are the reflection of God Almighty,

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:49.760
which is Purity,

00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:53.280
which is Truth, which is Knowledge.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:55.320
We are that.

00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:59.000
We are not like ordinary people.

00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:03.200
How can we live on that level?

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:06.360
Only if you are possessed, if you had a bad guru

00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.400
or something like that, maybe you are going like a yo-yo,

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.480
going up and down, up and down, up and down,

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:15.240
but those who have crossed all those limits

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:21.280
have reached that state, should value that they are the Spirit

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:25.960
so many Spirits sitting here, sitting, reflecting God Almighty.

00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:29.240
I am such a proud mother

00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.880
and all of you are capable of enlightening

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.680
so many people in this world.

00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:39.000
But the beauty within you is that you are

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:44.440
absolutely independent of anybody else.

00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:50.520
You depend only upon yourself,

00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.880
upon the source of your Spirit,

00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.160
the joy of your Spirit.

00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:59.760
You don't expect others to give you joy.

00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.440
Supposing somebody tomorrow comes and abuses Me.

00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.200
I'll say, "All right. It doesn't matter."

00:19:06.400 --> 00:19:09.080
It never touches Me

00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:12.520
because I am with Myself.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:15.120
He is saying these things.

00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:19.560
He will suffer or not suffer. That's not My department.

00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:23.560
When you start depending only upon yourself,

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.440
just imagine a house

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:31.600
which is standing on rocks.

00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:36.280
Like that, you are.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:42.560
Try to feel it. Feel the rock within you.

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.240
Try to understand.

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:51.080
You are not going to behave like other people.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:54.280
It's all right, people who have built their houses on sands

00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:59.160
have to worry, not we. We have built on rocks.

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:03.960
So we have to be very courageous.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:06.200
You have to be very bold.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.880
At the same time, extremely humble.

00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:14.680
When the tree is laden with fruits it bends down.

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.800
So we worship the Mother Earth.

00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:19.320
We worship the sun. We worship the moon.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.560
We  worship everything around us which has helped us.

00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.880
We worship our parents, everyone.

00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:30.720
But above all we worship ourselves.

00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:36.200
Because we are worshipable.

00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:38.600
Now all of you have become saints.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:41.920
That doesn't mean that you develop beards and

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.200
have all funny dresses and all that. Nothing of the kind.

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:47.960
You are saints because inside you

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:55.200
there is the fragrance of beautiful fragrance

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:57.080
of your lotus.

00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.040
That's the Spirit.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:02.720
This is a lotus you have made for Me here.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:07.720
Such a beautiful lotus, I am sitting in a beautiful lotus.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:13.040
In the same way is reflected in your heart as a beautiful lotus.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:16.240
Feel that lotus,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.720
how beautiful, how delicate it is.

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:26.640
It's pink because pink is the lotus which

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.120
invites everyone,

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:38.040
sign of generosity, of invitation.

00:21:38.240 --> 00:21:44.040
Pink colour attracts all kinds of insects, everybody.

00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:53.040
So lotus is pink

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:57.800
and it invites everything,

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.960
open to everything, not frightened of anything.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:05.960
But it comes out of the mire,

00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:11.520
comes out of absolutely horrible ponds.

00:22:11.840 --> 00:22:16.440
There are lots of worms going round it, all right,

00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.200
but it emits the fragrance

00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:28.080
and makes the whole pond so beautiful.

00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.600
That's what you are.

00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:35.720
Wherever you'll be, you can create that beauty.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:39.440
You can flow that beauty.

00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:46.160
You can make people see

00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:49.560
what a Spiritual person is.

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:53.400
You are the reflector of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.760
You have to reflect Sahaj Yoga.

00:22:57.280 --> 00:23:02.480
For such people are always in joy

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:08.720
and wisdom.

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:15.160
Shri Ganesha is the giver of wisdom

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.760
wisdom, how to behave at what time,

00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.480
how to say at what time,

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:25.360
how far to go with everything.

00:23:25.560 --> 00:23:27.240
It just should become innate,

00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:30.000
Sahaj. You don't have to work it out, but should know.

00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:32.920
"Now I am a Sahaja Yogini."

00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.840
Every morning you should tell yourself, "I am a Sahaja Yogini.

00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:41.560
So how far I should go?

00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:44.480
How should I behave?

00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:47.200
What should be my attitude?"

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:53.320
All this can be very easily understood if

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.800
you develop this lotus of wisdom.

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.920
How does a lotus come out? There is a seed which sprouts.

00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:09.800
That's how the wisdom - there is already the seed within you.

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.080
All of you have got and now it has started opening

00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:15.000
because you are realised souls.

00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:18.600
Allow your wisdom to take over.

00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:23.640
So how do you do it?

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.640
There's one way, I would say.

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:31.120
"Supposing Mother had this problem, what She would have done?"

00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.520
Very good idea.

00:24:38.760 --> 00:24:42.080
"How She would have dealt with it?"

00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:45.480
You may again say that we don't understand Mother's style.

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.040
She's full of tricks. Correct. I am.

00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:57.760
But there's a very simple way of doing it.

00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:02.440
You can surrender it to My wisdom

00:25:02.640 --> 00:25:05.840
and the wisdom itself that is in you is active.

00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.440
It will work.

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:13.720
This point also you should understand.

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.560
Wisdom within you is active.

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.280
There was one gentleman working at the airport in London.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.760
He's a Sahaja Yogi,

00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.400
but he doesn't come to the collective. He has no time.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.600
So somebody said something harsh to him.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:32.720
He went home and he said that

00:25:32.920 --> 00:25:37.760
"It's not good he said to me. After all, I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.440
And next day he heard

00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:45.240
the fellow has fallen from his bike.

00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:50.080
The gentleman might not have understood that because

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.720
he said all these things, "That's why this has happened to me."

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.520
But he knew because Deities are with you.

00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:04.160
So in wisdom you understand that all the Deities are just with you

00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:10.280
and whatever happens to you, they're before you.

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:15.440
Nobody can harm you. Nobody can touch you.

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:24.640
You are so protected. Lotuses are not protected.

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:29.880
You are so protected that anybody tries to harm you,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.840
immediately there's protection.

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.600
Also your own protection is there, as I said,

00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.640
that you jump into thoughtless awareness.

00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:46.840
We harm ourselves more than anybody else can sometimes.

00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:51.840
One friend of mine I knew,

00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:54.080
she was from very childhood she was like that,

00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:57.040
always crying for everything.

00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:58.840
Always she used to cry

00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:02.160
for nothing at all because she was such a spoiled child

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:05.080
that she used to always cry.

00:27:05.280 --> 00:27:08.760
Now, was surprised to see at a very young age she became blind.

00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:11.320
I said, "How did you become so blind?"

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:15.120
She had to use a very thick glass and all that.

00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:18.480
She said, "I used to cry so much, you remember."

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:20.520
I said, "That I remember,

00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.960
but did you cry even after school?"

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:27.160
"Yes, I was always crying like this."

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:31.360
So it's a kind of a personality you develop

00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:35.000
that "I'm like that, I just cry."

00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.520
But why not develop a personality that, "I am always in joy?"

00:27:39.720 --> 00:27:42.120
Anything I see, I feel joyous.

00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.040
Anything I hear, I feel joy.

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:52.480
Then this lotus of your fragrance will improve

00:27:55.720 --> 00:28:02.520
and then activity of your wisdom will be

00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:10.120
that you will take all that is very beautiful

00:28:11.480 --> 00:28:13.520
easily.

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:18.600
You'll get all that is very satisfying, very joyous.

00:28:18.800 --> 00:28:23.480
It's kind of an activity of this wisdom within you

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:29.080
which just leads you to people who are extremely nice,

00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.640
to situations which are very beautiful

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:35.960
where you discover nice things

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:52.520
or to such beautiful creations

00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:56.320
that you would never expect to see.

00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:04.800
It's very, very important to understand that you tell Me,

00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.480
"Mother, that this miracle happened, that miracle happened."

00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:11.120
Is nothing, is your own wisdom,

00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:16.240
your own Spirit is working it out.

00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:19.360
You don't have to do anything.

00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.600
Only thing you have to remember that you are a Sahaja Yogini

00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:27.040
and your character should be that of a Sahaja Yogini,

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:32.120
that your ideas should be that of a Sahaja Yogini.

00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:34.680
Same with Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:41.920
Sahaja Yogis, being men, they don't show much,

00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:46.520
but there are certain other ways of showing his temper.

00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:52.280
They get into tempers and sometimes the tempers are so much that

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:55.920
you just start looking, "What's the matter with the person?"

00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:59.040
One side the tempers, another side the crying.

00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:03.160
I mean, in between, what remains? I don't know.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:08.360
Both things are absolutely not needed.

00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.800
You have to correct people, to say things.

00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.680
Just now I had to say something. I've said it, finished.

00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:21.440
But it's not anger. It just - I have to act.

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.200
The difference is like this - I'm not involved with it.

00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.720
Even if I cry, I'm not involved. I'm just crying.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:33.280
Even if I am angry, I am not really angry.

00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:38.360
I am just trying to be angry in an acting.

00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:42.320
That's what happens.

00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:45.280
You do not get involved into it.

00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.920
But if you get involved into your anger,

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:51.480
then the joy is finished, completely finished.

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.200
Some people think also that

00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:01.240
if you are joyous you have to be very serious.

00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.880
Not at all.

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:05.760
What is there to be serious? What is to be serious in this world?

00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:08.360
Everything is stupidity.

00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.480
I don't find anything serious in this world.

00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.560
And I can't keep serious for more than three minutes.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.480
Sometimes people take advantage of that, but what can I do?

00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:20.680
That's My nature.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:23.600
What's so serious? You don't have to create sun.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:28.920
You don't have to create moon. You don't have to create Mother Earth.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.280
What's so serious? What great jobs have you to do?

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.960
Everything is there for you. Just enjoy.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:41.680
What is there to be so serious?

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:46.840
Some people, you know, try to impress also by their seriousness.

00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.480
Once I saw a lady standing, very seriously thinking.

00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.800
I said, "What is the problem?"

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:58.400
"I don't know how to broom this thing, I don't have a broom."

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.240
I said, "Such a big problem is there as if the heavens are falling.

00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.760
Doesn't matter today you don't do it.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.400
You can do it tomorrow. What is so important?"

00:32:08.600 --> 00:32:11.360
I mean if you don't have something, it's all right.

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.560
"No, no, no, I must do it. You see, I'm very house-proud."

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:18.960
I said, "That's the main problem which is serious."

00:32:20.200 --> 00:32:24.520
So because you suffer from some serious, stupid problems,

00:32:25.120 --> 00:32:28.560
that's why you become serious.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.480
And, by becoming serious, if you think

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:33.240
your problems will be solved, they will not.

00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:37.400
At the same time, I must tell you we should not be frivolous.

00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:41.160
We should not be vulgar and not frivolous.

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.960
That's not - see these flowers.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:48.080
Look at them. They are shaking with My vibrations.

00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:51.040
But look at them, in their own dignity.

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:54.640
They're going to die tomorrow. They are not bothered

00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:58.960
as long as they are all right there in their own place,

00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.400
giving you pleasure and happiness, finished.

00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.960
What is the use of a light?

00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:11.080
Let us see, as a light, as we are. To give the light.

00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:16.640
So, we are here to give joy, happiness to everyone,

00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:19.760
to make everyone happy.

00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:24.800
There are so many ways of making others happy.

00:33:25.560 --> 00:33:28.040
And for that, we have to learn also.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:31.920
So many things we have to learn, how to make others happy.

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.320
And then when you make them happy,

00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:37.760
then you feel that joy within yourself.

00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:41.280
"Oh, they're so happy." See their happiness,

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.680
then only this lotus opens out much more.

00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:50.600
Like a ripple moves and moves

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:55.960
to the end of the shores

00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.080
and then from the shore it returns back.

00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.800
In the same way, when your joy reaches the joy of others,

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:13.080
then the ripples that come up make a beautiful pattern of your life.

00:34:13.280 --> 00:34:15.200
Just think of such situations

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:18.480
where you did something good to others,

00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.520
being very nice to others

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.920
and then you found the joy in that person

00:34:25.120 --> 00:34:28.360
and how that joy came back to you.

00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:33.400
Think of that pattern that you felt so subtlety in your life,

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.720
how it is built in.

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:38.280
Whenever you think of that time or that moment

00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:45.040
or that area, whole picture comes to you

00:34:48.480 --> 00:34:53.200
and you think, "What a time!"

00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.920
But that time is eternally within you,

00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:02.760
all the time and that's why is Diwali so important.

00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:06.080
You are all, as I said, you are My light.

00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:10.720
And the light is there which is an eternal light.

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.960
These lights will be finished.

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:16.040
We'll have to light them every year. Not you people.

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:22.360
You have eternal light and this light is going to spread Joy.

00:35:22.800 --> 00:35:24.720
What's the problem of this world?

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.440
The whole problem, you take it.

00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:30.040
There's no joy.

00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.680
Simple as that, there's no joy.

00:35:36.360 --> 00:35:37.560
If they had joy

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.920
they would not have done all these nonsensical things.

00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:42.720
There's no Joy. When you have joy, you don't want to fight,

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:45.720
you don't want to do anything that is harmful.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.240
You don't want to say anything harsh to anyone,

00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.440
not only that but you do not want to have

00:35:51.640 --> 00:35:55.120
something that will spoil this Mother Earth

00:35:55.320 --> 00:35:57.360
or which will bring ecological problem.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.280
No, you just don't want it,

00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:03.120
don't want to do anything because it harms others.

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:10.160
People feel unhappy about it whether it is here, India, anywhere.

00:36:11.640 --> 00:36:15.280
You just feel that "Why should I do such a thing

00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:18.800
which is not so congenial to others?"

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.960
I mean, it's not joy-giving.

00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:26.520
So when you have joy, you have to be joy-giving

00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:28.600
and if you are not joy-giving

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:31.720
that means there's something lacking in your Sahaja Yoga

00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.120
and that's why we have to come up now.

00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:40.320
We have to become Sahaja Yoginis and Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.160
That is joy-giving society.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:46.080
We can change our name, if you like.

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:52.800
If Sahaja Yoga is not good - Joy Giving Association.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:13.200
Now also we should find out what kills the joy.

00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:17.800
That's important. What kills the joy?

00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000
First I said you must have wisdom.

00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:25.440
Wisdom means that it gives you detachment,

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:32.240
detachment from all that is selfishness,

00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.920
self-centredness,

00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.880
self-obsession,

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.760
ego

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:49.120
all connected with self. Can you imagine?

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:55.760
Selfish, the Self, means the Spirit.

00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:03.480
Selfishness is what?

00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:08.320
Is the one that completely darkens the Self

00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:13.440
because you think of yourself,

00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.840
your children, your family, that's all.

00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.200
At the most, even that sometimes - sometimes it's only yourself.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:28.880
And when you start thinking like that

00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:31.800
and when you start

00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:37.400
becoming smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller,

00:38:39.640 --> 00:38:42.520
the lotus collapses.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:51.360
But to think about others is so great.

00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:55.480
In My case is different.

00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.920
If I think about Myself really, I tell you,

00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.440
I feel very happy, nice, joyous, I must tell you, I must confess.

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:08.600
But some people I think of, immediately My chakras start catching

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:13.840
and I feel, "Oh, God, why did I think of such a person?"

00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:17.720
I mean, the chakras start moving fast for that person,

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:20.960
because this body is so generous.

00:39:21.160 --> 00:39:24.320
That you can't imagine, even if I see somebody,

00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.480
suddenly the chakras start working for that as if I'm responsible

00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:32.680
for everybody's chakras which are gone off,

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:36.800
which I am in a way, but to such an extent.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.720
But still I think

00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:44.640
about people who are in trouble,

00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:47.120
about every one of you.

00:39:47.320 --> 00:39:49.560
Why? Why do I think?

00:39:49.760 --> 00:39:57.200
Because I know that if I can improve your chakras, you'll be happy.

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:01.280
I don't have to logically go to that point,

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:05.760
but just My body knows it. It works.

00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:08.320
It works and feels very happy.

00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:11.000
When I see somebody getting their Realisation

00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.840
it's such a great joy to Me.

00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:16.400
When I see somebody being relieved of the problem,

00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:18.080
such a joy to Me

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:28.440
because joy-giving is the character, nature of Spirit.

00:40:31.520 --> 00:40:36.040
If you do not allow your Spirit to fulfill its own nature

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.080
and its own character,

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.480
Spirit is not going to manifest itself.

00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:49.440
So you are the vehicle.

00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.160
You are the lamp, you can say,

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:57.480
as far as body, mind is concerned.

00:40:57.680 --> 00:41:02.920
But this light of Spirit, if it has to manifest,

00:41:03.120 --> 00:41:07.440
then it has to be of a very unique type

00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:11.360
that it emits all its light outside.

00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.840
It gives light to others.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:24.640
And this light-giving quality, you have to improve.

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:28.680
Gradually you'll be surprised,

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.480
only if you try in your life,

00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.120
in your relationships, in your endeavors,

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.840
to give light to others, to make their lives better,

00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:46.360
not to show off, not to be egoïstical,

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.760
but in a very loving, beautiful manner,

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.040
you'll really understand

00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:57.520
that you are the Spirit,

00:41:57.720 --> 00:42:00.000
because Spirit loves.

00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:02.440
It loves.

00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:08.280
And in love you are forgiving, very forgiving.

00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:11.960
Sometimes, leaders get angry with Me that I'm rather forgiving.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:16.840
What can I do? That's My nature. I can't help it.

00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.040
Because I love, you know.

00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:25.240
If you love a person, you do forgive.

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:27.840
You don't feel bad.

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.520
Not to forgive is difficult, but to forgive is the best.

00:42:32.720 --> 00:42:37.080
At least, when you forgive there's no headache for you.

00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:42.880
So this Love, which is joy, actually I think,

00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:48.760
when this love melts and flows like a river

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:53.080
and gives nourishment

00:42:53.280 --> 00:43:02.400
to all the surrounding trees on the shores,

00:43:04.280 --> 00:43:06.520
that is the time,

00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:14.840
is the completion of the individuality or a personality

00:43:15.040 --> 00:43:21.240
of that love and that's the time, it feels fulfilled.

00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:26.960
It's not just that you have a light in the corner,

00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:30.080
but it has to flow.

00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.520
It has to move.

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:35.320
It has to nourish.

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:41.320
Love is not something dead, like a stone.

00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:48.520
When it melts, it encompasses everything

00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:52.360
and everything becomes very beautiful with that.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:56.760
So you have to first understand that

00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:59.920
life is for giving joy to others

00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:05.280
because you are now saints and your light has to give Joy.

00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:08.520
Little bit you have to bear.

00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:10.560
You have powers to bear.

00:44:10.760 --> 00:44:14.280
You have all the powers and so I wish you

00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:20.520
good luck for the next year and great prosperity.

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:22.640
May God bless you.
